Like, we'd be standing there He'd bend down to tie his shoe. He's stand up looking like he It was so bad my mom wouldn't which was weird growing up with and an outdoor friend, but [laughter] That's the way it had to be. So we're eight years old. We're jumping on his bed, We whack each other at the His nose just erupts. But I find out that I am to goose down. So he's got blood all over the I'm laid out on the bed with my gasping for air. We're both screaming for help. [laughter] My throat closes up. My dad has to rush me to the I've never seen him more by the way. Doctor comes in, he was like, &quot;He was in a fight.&quot; &quot;I don't see why that's [laughter] Definitely not a big when you find out that your you know, so... So cut to 20 years later, I still have a shameful 0 and 1 I'm in the East Village of It's about 10:00 on a Thursday I just bought some weed, and So I go down the stairs of the And as I swipe my card, Now, if you live in a small that might be a cause for but in a city of 8 million some of them are gonna be [laughter] It's pretty much par for the So I casually look over, and I girl, early 20s, and holding is a guy about my build, maybe and it's getting a little &quot;Eh, maybe--is he doing the But you can't scream while and also, he has one hand on The other hand is moving His form is terrible. [laughter] And I think maybe--maybe this some aggressive foreplay, to justify not getting And then he grabs her by the whips her against a wall, punches her in the face, She is now sobbing. He's trying to rip her pants And I'm like, &quot;You know what? I don't think they're [laughter] &quot;I think this guy is a rapist. &quot;Someone's got to stop this Not gonna be me, of course, And now he grabs her by the slams her head against the and no one is doing anything. He hits her again. I'm like, &quot;Shit. I've got to be that guy.&quot; So I yell out the most I can think of, &quot;Hey, buddy, that's a lady.&quot; [laughter] Imagine if that's all it took, &quot;It is a lady. This is...&quot; [laughter] &quot;That's the last time I'll without my glasses.&quot; [laughter] So as you can imagine, it has and he hauls off to hit her and I just fuckin' Hulk out. I go, &quot;Come on, let's go!&quot; Which is a pretty big jump &quot;Hey, buddy, that's a Could have gone with, &quot;Pick on or, &quot;I'm telling.&quot; [laughter] But it gets his attention, she pries his hand off her bolts through the turnstile, runs out of the station. She's gonna be okay. But then I turn back to him, I don't know if you guys have a rapist before... [laughter] But they do not take too kindly So he's just staring me down And I've got to tell you, under beautiful eyes, but... Right now, they're just cold And I'm taking full inventory I'm like, &quot;All right, 5'10&quot;, I want to be able to give a to the police when I wake from [laughter] So he takes his first step and very calmly goes, &quot;What you And part of me is tempted to out of this, you know, &quot;I didn't mean to interfere. If you hurry, I'm sure you can [laughter] I'm tempted, but I don't do I'm like, &quot;All right, come to take this guy out,&quot; so I and I start yelling, &quot;Back the Back the fuck up.&quot; And I can tell you, that does when you yourself are fearfully [laughter] So I hit the opposing wall. He's got me backed into a I got nowhere to go. So I have no choice but to try So I take a deep breath, and I step in with a I'm just gonna lay this guy And I may have if I wasn't [laughter] So there's this horrible moment whiz past his face. I'm like, &quot;Nooo.&quot; He steps in, clobbers me. My knees buckle, but I don't I'm like, &quot;All right, &quot;is not my strong suit. &quot;I'm gonna come back, kick this like I just completed a women's [laughter] So I step in, I swing, he scoots back at the last I miss his balls, but I get and here's what I know about my Way too polite, can't land a and when I kick someone, I make I go.... [whimpers] [laughter] Not my proudest moment, but I And he stumbles back, and he and he runs out of the station, so now I'm feeling like hot I'm like, &quot;I've got a &quot;I didn't back down. He ran off. Right? I saved that woman. I think I'm the first guy with from train tracks rather than tie her to them. So now I'm feeling invincible. I'm about to get on the train And this older woman stops me. She goes, &quot;Oh, my God. You have a massive laceration And I looked down, and there's down my face onto my jacket and I go, &quot;Is it bad?&quot; She goes, &quot;It appears to be [laughter] And my adrenaline's pumping, I just feel warmth, and I kind replay everything in my head. And I think, &quot;Well, that guy &quot;in a funny way. &quot;He didn't really punch me so &quot;There's blood everywhere. &quot;I did not get punched. &quot;I did not win a fight. I just got stabbed in the [laughter] Now, I don't know about you by a stranger with a foreign first thing that comes to mind, Now I have AIDS.&quot; [laughter] I know that's not how it works. You've got to share a glass of [laughter] Paranoia was taking hold of me, &quot;some spiteful psycho running &quot;with an infected box cutter and now I just have AIDS I think, &quot;You know what? Maybe it won't take hold if so I actually lean over. Like, &quot;Go. Get out of me.&quot; And the same woman, she goes, She reaches into her purse, slaps them on my face, 'cause, every woman over 30 has a And she leave me up in the dozen cops on the scene within They all want to see the cut. So one after another I remove Each time, another pint of And they all have the same They just go, &quot;Ooh, put it put it back, put it [laughter] So another cop rolls up, and he &quot;Hey, do you mind if I see it?&quot; His partner goes, &quot;You see Just picture another one right So all these cops are swarming &quot;I've got that 1/4 ounce of Now, this is New York. This is not the weed-topia your [laughter] It's not like I'm gonna show And he's like, &quot;Oh, cool. [laughter] So justifiably, I'm freaking And I feel this big mitt on my And I'm like, &quot;Oh, my God. I'm fucked. He spins me around, and this how's it feel to be a goddamn And he reaches into his back hands me his business card, &quot;You ever need anything, you call me; I got your back.&quot; And I was like, &quot;I may take you a little sooner than you think, [laughter] So ambulance finally shows up. I'm in the hospital. And I listen to a lot of rap I hear a lot of reference to a And a buck fifty is a facial 150 stitches, and I don't know right here--right there. You see it? A mere 23 stitches, which has to make you wonder facial laceration requires 150 st... I think that's decapitation. [laughter] No need to be alarmed, sir. We'll simply sew your head back You'll be good to go. So ten days later, I get my And I seem to be healing up And that night, I'm brushing my and I notice this clear liquid And, &quot;Oh, my God. It was just residual goop. And it keeps up for a few days. I go back to the doctor, and it cut me, he hit my salivary So I am now drooling out of [laughter] Not a little dribble, buckets Like, you put a plate of wings I'm just a slobbering Saint Which is ironic, because I'm a so I'm just roaming the streets with a pack of dogs in tow. They're looking at me like, [laughter] It was so bad I could push on across the room, I didn't have that at the time I'd be like, &quot;Back the fuck up, Don't make me do it.&quot; So now I'm just feeling This is just a misery. Like, I should just run off and the Coney Island freak show. I'll be the boy with the Super [laughter] So two weeks goes by, drooling stops, I go back to He's like, &quot;All right, I think &quot;out of the woods. &quot;All you've got is that &quot;Halloween's around the corner. You're gonna go as the Joker.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Well, the &quot;on both sides of his face, so and stop a left-handed [laughter] &quot;I don't know, man.&quot; But it all has a happy ending. I am fine, obviously. It turns out he did not give me Had it all along. [laughter] Girl got away, and they They caught the guy. [cheers and applause] Three days after the whole they found him running right Remember I thought he was my 55-year-old drunk homeless man.
