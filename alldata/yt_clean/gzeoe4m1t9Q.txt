Tonight, we're talking about the news media. [AUDIENCE GROANS] Yeah. [AUDIENCE BOOS] Yeah. [AUDIENCE BOOS] It is, for me, my bete noire, my white whale, the pea under my mattress...

[LAUGHTER] Now, we're not gonna for this whole program. We're just going to show you at accomplishing their goals. Let's start with our story, and begin with a gentleman Rufo wanted to make critical race theory into a political winner for Republicans. This was his stated goal. It's not so easy! I'm kidding. Have a look. - It's absolutely astonishing has purveyed at every institution And I call on the President this executive order, and stamp out this destructive, divisive, at its root. The fucking guy! "Oh, call on the President." Who the fuck? Let me tell you something! He's the President of the United States. Christopher Rufo, he goes on September 1st, and Well, guess what? His words echoed infinitely, all the way to September 17th. - Students in our universities are inundated with critical race theory. This is a Marxist act, holding that America is a [AUDIENCE GROANS] Aren't cult leaders [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] That's the weirdest delivery. [APPLAUSE] "This is... Uhhh... This is Kool-Aid... [LAUGHTER] Fruity and delicious... [LAUGHTER] You should drink it... [LAUGHTER] Not around walls... Because... [LAUGHTER] Giant pitcher..." [LAUGHTER] Fucking 16 days from the time and said, &quot;I call on the about critical race theory,&quot; to when the President did Now, of course, you can't binge-watching your whatever you tell him to do. So, in this new age of had to work a little harm-to-table critical - Kids across America are being force-fed the critical race theory poison. - You have to get organized. - Turn around and say, I don't want Communists - Complain vocally, loudly. - Shame on you! - So, you're the racist! - This is an unlawful arrest! I have a first amendment right! - Parents have had it, Jack. - I don't really think with so much passion, It's not grassroots! You lit the fire, and then as &quot;I've never seen a fire like this.&quot; It's like when a dog vomits on a carpet, and then eats it, [LAUGHTER] and looks at you like, [LAUGHTER] &quot;Can I get a treat for No! [LAUGHTER] You made the mess in the first place! Suddenly, we're banning CRT, we're restricting race teaching, we're banning books, and Florida has legislation to make it illegal for a white person to feel uncomfortable. In Florida. [LAUGHTER] Good luck arresting humidity. [LAUGHTER] &quot;My balls are sticking to my leg. [LAUGHTER] Officer! [LAUGHTER] Remove...&quot; Alright.

Well, you know, Brian, that covered critical race theory. And that became a big issue. [JON LAUGHS] [LAUGHTER] It sure did! [LAUGHTER] But that's how fucking That's how good... And if you're gonna battle political and media, together- we're going to need a hero. A hero brave enough to in grave danger of succumbing to CRT panic and "Let's Go, Brandon" memes. [LAUGHTER] Who's that hero? - There is no democracy - Our job is to speak truth to power. - Our job is to shine a to hold the powerful to account. - Because knowing empowers us. Knowing helps us decide. Knowing keeps us free. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] I mean, seriously? But in an age of weaponized secrecy and political polarization, the one group that stands at the ready to shine light into that darkness, so that the good ship America needn't stub its toe on the post-midnight snack of fascism... I'm mixing metaphors. [LAUGHTER] But the point is this: the fourth estate has claimed twixt America and peril. A bulwark to creeping fascism. Our media. They are the watchers on the wall. No, that's the wrong... Okay, that's... That's the wrong watcher That's the wall. That's the watcher. [LAUGHTER] Yes, thank you. To the ramparts, heroes! - Three, two, one! Happy New Year!. [LAUGHTER] Well, America, it's been We're fucked. Yes, unfortunately, if they are between America and because rarely has that has such a distance and its execution. And thus, the problem...

Bobby Three-Sticks, - Why'd they call him- [LAUGHTER] And slowly, the oxygen drops. And thus began the turn to darkness. Let the overplaying of - If you do have something to hide, Mueller's probably the to be investigating you. - Bob Mueller is going to and if there's any wrongdoing, - Director Mueller is going - He will find it. and you despair that there's wake up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
