If I may, Gilyarovsky, I have read your excellent reports that only someone who sincerely loved God forbid! Stanislavsky is right. Though a magnet for vice you could hardly find It's where a man It's a fascinating place. - So we're going? I'll take the risk. Gentlemen, are you ready to order?

The homeless, the tramps, and the jobless Why not tear it down? The owner of the largest shelter Need I say more? Welcome to the Chain Gang Inn, After you. Look at that one, all dolled up. I'll kill you! Oh - hello! Vodka! Hey, boy! Clear this up. Half a bottle of vodka Do you know everyone here? Not everyone, of course, but one or two. Take a look over there. How old is that woman, do you think? I wouldn't like to say. And yet, she's just 22 years old. A prostitute since she was eight. Sells any children she has to beggars. - Spends the money on vodka. Oh, yes - children are hired out to beggars from birth. In the last week of lent, a newborn child who cries a good deal A three-year-old will go for ten. A child might die but she'll carry on [Singing in French] Who is that? That's Ksenia. - They call her &quot;The Countess&quot;. Because she was born an aristocrat. How did she end up here? Her father ruined himself. She came to Khitrovka as a girl. Rather than die of hunger, And now Boldokh, the most respected thief &quot;Fancy&quot;, you say? Mistress, or kept woman, She's waiting for his release. She loves him? How should I know? My dear Gilyarovsky... can you introduce us? I see you are also One moment. Countess! Join us! Over here! Good day, Countess. And the same to you. Won't you sit down? How's business? Gilly, don't embarrass me, not in front of strangers. When did the truth ever embarrass you? Allow me to introduce our great director. I can't say that I have. So, you fancied To thrill my nerves... Oh, Gilly, I'm so tired of all your... voyeurs. We're like animals in a zoo to them. Not to me. - We can help clean out your pockets. For example, I'd like to know... what that man's really like. Why? Besides, it's pointless. - You've nothing in common. I'm playing a drunkard on the stage. One way or another, Listen to this: &quot;Man pays for everything himself. For faith, and its absence. This is why he is free. Then what is man? Man is not you, nor I, nor they - no! Man is you, I, they, It is immense! It is glorious! None of that is true. What? How did it go... &quot;Man - it sounds majestic!&quot; Look at us! How can &quot;man&quot; sound majestic here? Say it with irony, with a grin. Maybe then I would believe you. Twenty-six! Take care, old man. - What's happening? This lot will wait it out on the roof. Come along - I'll introduce you to someone very interesting indeed. &lt;i&gt;Run for it!&lt;/i&gt; He's a real Indian. but I think it's an alias. - An Indian? He has a glorious red turban I believe he sleeps in it. - What brought him to Russia? He says nothing of himself. A mysterious fellow... It's like the cave of the forty thieves We play chess on occasion. Gilyarovsky, I think... the door is open. Open? Strange. Well, in that case, shall we? Is he...? He's dead. We must call the police. Hey, Pip! - Get Rudnikov. Hold your tongue! Where am I going, then? This way. Maikov, wait for me here. And who might you be, sir? Bystanders are not permitted. He's with me. the great director. Yet another of your tourists, then. For God's sake, don't touch anything. So, he has breathed his last. May he rest in heaven, Look at this. Gilyarovsky, you've dragged me away Why the rush? Doesn't look to me like But who could have killed him? He had all sorts of shady dealings The locals keep it simple: Here, our murder weapon is... some kind of toothpick. A toothpick? Gilyarovsky, what's this? Don't touch it! Well... A decorative feature. But it's not hanging on a nail. So what? Rajah had a shopful Lord knows what we might find. All the same... who would do this? A man like Rajah What do you want from me? The lock is intact, No sign of a fight. how would we know? What a lot of clutter. If it was an acquaintance, You know any acquaintance of his? How many do you know? None, actually. I know only one: you. You told me of your chess games yourself. Maybe you killed him. For beating you at chess. Well, did you kill him? - Very funny. Gentlemen, there's another dart over here. Keep your hands off. Why here? It's obvious. The killer missed. No need to play the investigator, eh? I'll just take this then, shall I? Take it. Maikov! Search the whole place, then lock it. Bring the bird, or it'll die. Just a moment. Look. What do you mean - who? Yes... More than ten years ago. - He sailed on the Petersburg? Perhaps he did. His life is a mystery. and now it will remain so. Let's go. SS PETERSBURG &lt;i&gt;And the killer?&lt;/i&gt; - They'll be caught? Rajah had no relatives. and he'll be forgotten. We must get to the bottom... of this mysterious toothpick. Can such a tiny wound really kill a man? Wait... Look carefully. The sharp end changes colour. Is it coated with something? Possibly... I know just the man to help us. Professor! Professor! - Professor! - 'tis I. I'm coming down. Professor, may I introduce Konstantin Stanislavsky, the director. - And actor. Founder of the Moscow Art Theatre. And this is Agafon Strassenmaier. - Doctor. Take a look at that! What a beauty. Good and fresh. What if someone comes looking for him? By the time they catch on, Professor. - I'm five kopeks short. I'm all out. Old miser. Right. What on earth are you doing? Well, just like what I am a surgeon, Need anything cutting out, Professor, we've brought I'll wager it won't surprise me. I seem to have lost. I won't bother In your opinion, could this kill a man? That depends on And? I need time. - A day? And no guarantees. Very well, two days it is. Until then. Come along, Stanislavsky. Let me see... The stoker got drunk again. - So hire another. twice the rate. Don't forget that if we want we need to raise their wages. Prices are going up everywhere. We're spending three thousand roubles on firewood alone. And don't forget the royalties. I already paid Gorky his advance. You can keep my director's royalties. And you demand gooseberry jam Not only is it impossible to find, But you, my friend, are a director! And Chekhov said that No one in the audience can see But as Vershinin I &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; see. Incidentally, that new watchman of yours, Kolotushkin? He lisps. - So what? How can you employ In a theatre! My dear Stanislavsky, the censor is taking issue and you talk to me of Kolotushkin?! Here. Listen to what they're writing. &quot;The play has absolutely no plot, just endless chaotic coming and going&quot;. And there's more: &quot;If left unchanged, but simply unpublishable.&quot; I'm not sure Gorky I've written - I'm sorry, I must go. We have a rehearsal! Start without me. Stanislavsky! - Have you any white roses? My dear, who gives But Liza, I know my sister loves them. Be that as it may, - Young ladies like bright colours. [In French] &lt;i&gt;- Stand clear!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Get along, dearie!&lt;/i&gt; In the language of flowers, Is not white better? - Ksenia. I don't know you. Return that, or I'll call a policeman. &lt;i&gt;Hey! Watch it!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Five, and I'll change that one.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Yes, we don't want that one.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;How about this one?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;That one there looks fresher,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Of course, my dear.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;An excellent choice of flowers.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Five is enough.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;What? Where?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;My God!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;- Oh, Andrey, you're always losing things.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Well, my dove, you really shouldn't...&lt;/i&gt; Didn't you recognise me? Stanislavsky, the director. I've lost a day's earnings thanks to you. What other option did I have? Allow me to invite you for a coffee. If I have a coffee, Let me compensate you, then. How much? You'd offer money to a thief, Not just like that. For conversation. Very well. - But I shan't join you for coffee. You are strange. To be interested Are tramps not people? &quot;Washed up has-beens&quot;, that's what others call them. &lt;i&gt;Khitrovka.&lt;/i&gt; They're speaking out of fear. It's easier to step away Understand what? Why people choose - Take you: you dress well. Irrelevant. You speak good French. Why do you remain in Khitrovka? Khitrovka raised me. My father, in a fit of alcoholic rage, cracked open then vanished to hard labour in Siberia. I was just four years old, Two years I lived I stole for her at the market And then the woman died. - I was taken in by the cats. You would call them pimps. Every single thing So it is. False. Now stop accompanying me. Why? Khitrovka has no pity for strangers. And Gilly isn't with you now. &lt;i&gt;Stand clear!&lt;/i&gt; - You're here. Your share. You've a visitor. Rudnikov's waiting. What an honour. How would I know? But I wouldn't go see him. Why not? My conscience is clear. &lt;i&gt;There's your wine!&lt;/i&gt; Good day, Inspector. I am. How can I help? The thing is... I suppose... you must miss Boldokh terribly. What's to miss? We know how free you are... Tell me... wasn't it you - You're not a thief until caught. So, my dear... Your handkerchief, I believe? Well... yes. Good of you to admit it. Found at Rajah's. Remember dropping it? I wasn't there. - You weren't there? Well then, perhaps some time in a cell Right? - Here you go. MYASNITSKAYA POLICE DISTRICT - Is Rudnikov in? I want to see him! Get me a police officer. I need to see him! Khitrovka's mine! Get out of here! Gilyarovsky. Inspector, I hear you've arrested Gossip travels fast in Moscow. Come in. Well, Gilyarovsky, I see the detective's path tempts you yet. Why do you think she's the killer? There. That's precisely the difference Persistence and a meticulous approach. Off you went, while my men They found this: her handkerchief. Why do you think it's hers? It's well known in Khitrovka five dozen And she happens to have That's surely It's not enough for that, no. But it is enough to make her And has she? No. The stubborn girl. But she will. Inspector, allow me to talk to her. The Countess, darts - Why would she kill him? Gilyarovsky, you are an old hand You ought to know by now are committed on every corner. I won't allow it. I still don't believe I bumped into her recently, we talked. Stanislavsky, you're an idealist. The Countess is a thief, Rudnikov is right. Carriage! I've seen how Well, our excursion is over. It should suffice for your play. My thanks. - Will you join me? All the best. E.P. MARSHIN'S GRAPE WINES - If you're passing the theatre, stop by. - Stoleshnikov. Steady! &lt;i&gt;Hot off the press!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Papers, papers!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Papers for sale!&lt;/i&gt; Well, well, well. &quot;Revered Director Without Police Permission.&quot; What a headline that would make. What's your excuse? The same as yours, it would seem. I came to see How did you get in? The same way you did. Through the open window. The police must have forgotten it. Hear that? That was the door. Someone's here. The police, perhaps? I doubt it. Then who? Who is it? - Quiet now! - Who are you? Nephew of the man who lives here. Can you prove it? - I have a photograph in my wallet. K. FISHER PHOTO STUDIO - What's your name? And yours? Stanislavsky, the director. Gilyarovsky, the journalist. - Vladimir Gilyarovsky? I've heard that name. Don't you play chess with my uncle? And where is he? I suppose you haven't heard... Your uncle was murdered. Allow us to offer Yes... That is a severe blow indeed. He brought me here as a child from India. Gave me an education. How did he die? A dart was found in his neck. Most likely, poisoned. - Strange. why someone might have killed him? I don't know. was strictly legal. But he wasn't an easy person to kill. A chakram? An ancient Indian weapon. A metal ring with sharpened edges. Is this it? Yes, that's it. So, there was a fight after all. Someone comes to visit Rajah Talk turns to argument. throws the chakram, but misses. Do you know his lodgings well? Could you tell I'll need some time. What about the hidden safe? Uncle showed it to me years ago. He asked me to take something from it Let's look there. It's gone. - What's gone? It likely held Uncle was a collector of rarities. What happened? Murdered! Back! Right... Stanislavsky, stay here. I'm coming with you. He's gone. Look at that. Strange. It's as if the foot is split. How strange. This entire affair Well... We must call Rudnikov. He'll be thrilled. and now he has to find the real killer. Let's go. Really, Professor! Intending to kill the only person left I haven't applied any poison yet. The worst you risked was losing an eye. - Oh, well, in that case... I believe this is more or less the idea. I've been busy experimenting, But I have another. Care for a demonstration? No need. You're sure? Professor, what poison is it? You cannot imagine how many plants exist from which excellent poisons can be made. Your choice depends on to suffer, - If you... The poison was made from the seeds of a rare plant: Commonly known as the rosary pea. In fact, to kill a man with this poison, very little is required: a touch to the skin, The rosary pea South-east Asia, Burma, India... I have no theory to offer Rajah was from India. That dart was a greeting from his past. Well done, Professor. You are peerless, as ever. That has been said before, You wouldn't like Some other time. We must be going. Ah, well. Give us a smoke, mister! Are you the bartender we seek? I am the bartender. But I see you haven't come to drink vodka. You aren't fooling anyone What are you here for, gentlemen? We need a word with Satan. I don't know that name. Tell him Gilly's here. Very well. Escort our guests to the Underworld. &lt;i&gt;- I poured you vodka!&lt;/i&gt; In much knowledge is much grief. Gilly... Need I remind you what happens I expect it's the same who are slow to pay their debts. Who is this? The great director, Stanislavsky. No, I have not. Well, director... you're a long way from home. You have three minutes. I wish to know if any object of particular value has surfaced in Khitrovka of late. Come now, you know the rules: I don't give up my people. As you know, neither do I. I'd like to talk to the man. Of particular value, you say? Yes, very particular. Not our specialty. We deal in mere baubles. Or Brown. - Brown is on holiday. And Testov has no dealings with Khitrovka. Only with Boldokh. And only because Boldokh is a genius. Boldokh is serving time. I heard he escaped. You heard, or he escaped? I heard. Time's up. We'll be going then. It's been a pleasure. - I think that went well. I say, that was rather convincing. Right, time to get out of here. If you please! Do you think... Boldokh has really escaped? If Satan says he heard it, then it's true. And the only place to hide Who's this Testov? Nikanor Testov, Which means he has - Then we must pay him a visit. &lt;i&gt;- Out of my way!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Better than Cuban cigars&lt;/i&gt; Thank you. &lt;i&gt;Get your cut and warm-water shave...&lt;/i&gt; Look at this, Gilyarovsky. Michelangelo's Bacchus. Why, of course it's a copy, But a 17th-century copy. I acquired it Well, this is beyond my wildest dreams! I saw &lt;i&gt;Three Sisters&lt;/i&gt;. - Such restraint, such nobility... Gilyarovsky, what brings you here? No, no reports. you've had any interesting propositions in the last few days. - Ho, Gilyarovsky. - You've a nose like a dog. I have indeed. I had a visit from a rogue. He had a casket of extraordinary beauty. Stolen, no doubt. And in the casket... There it was... the Sparkle of the East. - The Sparkle of the East? An emerald of rare size, in a gold setting studded with diamonds. And just imagine, about where you are now, Did you buy it? No. - We never buy stolen goods. Of course not. I simply showed him out. And do you know what? Only yesterday, By his accent, he must have been English. His cane was most striking. An intricately carved knob - A man's body and a bird's head. The inspector told me of a theft, I knew at once and naturally told him what I knew. It did occur to me that he was - And that cane... My thoughts exactly! It would make for a novella, How fortunate we came. Do go on. Stanislavsky is - Me? Your wife too. We have a new play opening, Well, I'm delighted. - With pleasure! All the best. A pleasure, gentlemen. You're early. I was expecting you in an hour. The back door was open. Have you been here long? Long enough to hear Who were those gentlemen? Don't you know? and the director, Stanislavsky. You simply must go and see He's a master on the stage. Why did you tell them about me? Oh, I just threw them a few tidbits Don't worry, They're creative types... In this business, contacts are everything. In which regard, Boldokh will be expecting you at this address, at four this afternoon. You're sure you saw the necklace? As I see you now. It's strange. That secret was known only to two people. One is dead, The thing is, Boldokh... is a master in the art of breaking in. There is no lock that he cannot open. Will that be all? My conditions have changed. I shall bring and receive immediate payment. No, my dear fellow, that won't do. It's out of the question. You have no reason not to trust me. I, on the other hand... Let us leave things as they are. You will bring me the goods today, Or else I wish you luck Very well. Our agreement stands. As you can see, Yes. That is true. Still, it was foolish English devil. THE FOREIGNER WHO INTERESTS YOU Mr Chekhov and Mr Nemirovich-Danchenko Good to see you, Chekhov. - Likewise. Won't you sit down? You're late, Stanislavsky. - The menu. - As you wish. My God. A triumph of chemistry the preparation of ice cream Isn't it amazing? - Most curious. - I very much want to try it. Stanislavsky has become - You don't say! He and Gilyarovsky With Gilly? One can do anything and feel safe He paid me a visit last year at Melikhovo. He covered 85 kilometres a day and killed a bear, a fox, We've become embroiled Stanislavsky here Indeed, so am I! Ten years ago, I went off travelling. Siberia to Sakhalin, and back by boat What a glorious trip! Plenty of &quot;thrills&quot;, as you put it. You sailed via India. I did indeed. Perhaps you came across a small dart, dipped in poison, and shot from a tube. You won't believe it, but I did. - Well, go on. we made a stop at the Andaman Islands to pick up an Indian Sikh who had just completed A brutal place, so he said. He asked about Russia, There is a tribe that lives there... Dwarf savages that hunt with the help of small, poisoned darts, Did they have any notable features? Congenital deformities, perhaps, I couldn't say. But it's entirely possible. I heard they sell their children Gentlemen, all this is most diverting, but let us finally turn to business. Now, Chekhov... Excuse me, yes - Chekhov. - It seems your new play is a comedy? Not merely a comedy, I am most pleased with my title: &quot;The Cherry... OrchArd&quot;. Forgive me, surely you mean, &quot;Orchard&quot;? No, no. &quot;The Cherry OrchArd&quot;. It has a ring to it, no? - Yes. By the way, It's troublesome. The censors are a nightmare. They want to tear it up. For you. - Thank you. TESTOV MURDERED. ...and we'll certainly I said it had a ring to it! Please excuse me. - A pleasure, Chekhov. Of course. My dear fellow, Do me a favour and take the play. - There goes our Stanislavsky! Fascinating. What is? An unexpected plot twist, worthy of Shakespeare. - We only just left, and... What Stanislavsky means is this is a high profile case. You didn't find anything? Nothing. It's the devil's work. What's this? Let me see. Ah. Well... A note of some kind. The addressee is unclear. People write notes all the time. Forgive me, Inspector. Excuse me, gentlemen. - Please, do not touch anything. Don't touch a thing. Maikov, with me. Nikanor, my dear, sweet Nikanor... There, there now. Come now, this way... Maikov. That note is meant for us. &quot;The foreigner who interests you He doesn't finish. Why do you think I think this &quot;foreigner&quot; is Why the intrigue? Why not tell us from the start? Perhaps he couldn't. This note was written We discussed the necklace, who was interested in the necklace. Testov was killed immediately after - Could the Englishman be our man? Testov was killed with such an unusual weapon there is only one killer. You said it yourself: How did the Englishman know He most likely overheard. There must be a back door. Yes, well. It's not much to go on. Give me that. It looks like Testov I would never Where did you...? I told you, I wanted In one investigation, he found &quot;Shlyuzovaya Embankment, Remarkable! Do you know it? We'll find it. I'm quite sure it's where We must hurry. It should be somewhere here. Look! Ah, the genius himself. Allow me to introduce the legendary thief of Khitrovka, Rudnikov will be pleased. What a horrible way to die. Yes... Believe me, he didn't go quietly. Look! The same, strange footprints So there were two killers. Our Englishman and It all fits with what Chekhov told me. Here's what I think: there's a dwarf savage So, in your opinion, the Englishman brought this savage to Russia Why go to the trouble? Because the dwarf has a unique weapon: a dart that causes instantaneous death. Perhaps... We're finished here. So, you believe - Why not use a dart on Boldokh? I think I have it! escaped from prison The Countess knew and visited him there. She dropped her handkerchief. She refuses to talk, Boldokh chanced to see &lt;i&gt;While hiding at Rajah's,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;When they killed Rajah,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and somehow managed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He stole the necklace,&lt;/i&gt; Rather than get his hands dirty, Testov Boldokh recognised he wouldn't escape with his life. Ergo, both Englishman and necklace No. Boldokh was an old hand. He wouldn't have taken In that case, we need to know what this Englishman will do next. He will look for Boldokh's hiding place, Like The Countess, who's in a cell, True, but that will have to wait. Do you have any plans for this evening? I always have plans. Then cancel them. Have you seen &lt;i&gt;Three Sisters&lt;/i&gt; yet? - No. &quot;Tarara-boom-dee-ay, &quot;Here he is, sitting around.&quot; &quot;And why not?&quot; &quot;Nevermind. Did you love my mother?&quot; &quot;Very much.&quot; &quot;When you grab happiness in snatches, only to lose it, as I do, bit by bit you grow coarse, and spiteful. Here inside I'm boiling.&quot; Can I help you? My name is William Fox, We help those of noble origin who find There is a lady held here. - I would like to talk to her. Bravo! Bravo! My name is William Fox. I represent a British charity. You speak Russian well for a foreigner. I've been travelling Russia I like your country. It is most entertaining. But I digress. I have a business proposition for you. I don't do business with strangers. But we are acquainted, Ksenia... in absentia... through Boldokh. I know no such person. He has something It has value only to me, Why don't you ask him? Return it to me. I will pay five thousand roubles for it. For a trifle? May I introduce Pongo, my servant. A most unusual creature. The last of the cannibalistic He shoots poisoned darts, Just a scratch is enough to kill a man. Run along now, Pongo. Pongo is essentially an animal. Now, where were we? Ah, yes. It belonged to my mother. I wish to know where it is. I don't know. Ask Boldokh, if you can find him. He has answered his last question, I fear. Think on it. That's it. Hand me that. Well, Gilyarovsky, you'll have no choice about the good work of the Moscow police. - You have good news? It was you who brought it. We've got our man. One Boldokh, a thief and escapee who was especially violent in His motive, unfortunately, since his own associates But you know he's not the killer. The case is closed. I'm on my way to give a statement to the Chief of Police. Fine fellow! Look here, old chap, A pretty lass... But, a fool. All women are fools. I told her time and again: you must keep respectable company. And off she goes with that Boldokh. They all end up the same, try as you might. Well, Rudnikov? Oh, I released her. Released her?! Here we go! I hold her here - I'm wrong. What have you done?! Clear the way! &lt;i&gt;Home-grown tobacco!&lt;/i&gt; Good day, mademoiselle. What is your decision? I asked you to help Very well.

Straight to Krymsky Bridge, We'll all meet there. Good God, what's that? That's the least of it. They haven't cleaned down here This is where we part ways: They both lead to the Otvodnoy, - Take the torch, Stanislavsky. I may have need of my fists. Let's go. Thank you. Careful now. Stop. Look. - What is it? Are you certain our Englishman isn't... lying in wait for us? Not at all. But I do know Come on. Don't hang back, Stanislavsky. Mr Gilyarovsky. We have not yet met. And there's really no need. Stop following me, and no one will die. How about this? Thought you had me, eh? That's more like it. You can do this... You were magnificent. - Thanks. As you see.

There was an Englishman, As for the necklace, that's the last As in any good tragedy. Here it is! The set designed This is where we'll perform Impressive. An exact replica. Yes. It does feel as though I must congratulate you, Inspector. For military merit! To be honest, I can't for the life of me Foreigners, dwarves, poisoned darts... And in our capital city, no less. No... A damn strange affair. No stranger than human nature. In my opinion, we can reconstruct We need only an understanding of human motives and actions. Let's hear it then. This story began a decade or so ago, in India, that ancient and wondrous land subjugated by the British. During the crushing a priceless necklace went missing The Sparkle of the East. I am certain it was stolen by our Rajah, along with a certain The incident was much publicised, I learned of it who was living in India then. As it turned out, Rajah and Norris emerged unscathed, their guilt unproven. But shortly after, Norris was condemned to hard labour in the Andaman Islands for some serious crime. Rajah... seized the opportunity. He fled, taking the necklace with him. Thanks to Chekhov, we know that the Russian SS Petersburg sailed past Rajah got on that ship to Russia, where he later settled in Khitrovka. Norris, meanwhile, managed to escape hard labour and immediately He somehow became acquainted with Testov, who was by then Naturally, he knew He was most likely It was Testov... who let slip to Norris So Norris arrived in Khitrovka, the very same night that This is of course all most interesting, but we have no way of verifying it. In art, it is not the facts If you succeed in convincing your audience, then your creation is, in fact, the truth. [Praying in Arabic] &quot;What is man? Man is not you, nor I, nor they, no... Man is you, and I, and they. An old man, Napoleon, Mohammed... all in one. It is immense. Do you see? In this, all things begin and end. All is in man. All is for man. Man alone exists. All else is merely the work of his hands and of his brain. Man. It sounds... majestic.&quot; Bravo! Bravo! Stanislavsky. Look who I've brought to see you. We came to congratulate you - Did you truly like it? You said it so perfectly this time: &quot;Man - it sounds majestic.&quot; I felt my heart stop. You are a great actor. Thank you, Ksenia. Gilyarovsky didn't show me Don't mention it. It was... made for you. How did you pull that off? You are a very beautiful woman. I would ask you to leave with me, but you are hardly likely to consent. And I do not. I wanted to offer you But you are a lady of means now, and you can live anywhere you like, It's so strange... This necklace could see me but I don't want it. Will you take it? I couldn't. I'm a lazy fellow, Think of poor Nemirovich-Danchenko. Stanislavsky... - We are all waiting. I'm coming. - Join us. Won't you join us? At Cafe Hermitage, No, thank you. Will you accompany me, Gilly? Where to? Home? To Khitrovka. Still Khitrovka? Khitrovka is my home. I grew up there, and there I'll stay. Someone must sing Goodbye, dear Stanislavsky. I... Ksenia! Never have I known such a woman. You are extraordinary. Are you declaring your love for me? Your heart belongs to the theatre, Shall we go, Gilly? Countess, let me walk you home. They'll take your head for such riches. You're not afraid? I'm not afraid. You know me. Well then. Take good care. Thank you for everything, Gilly. Gilly! Gilyarovsky. Will you take it? No. I fear I'd turn to drink. I'm not made for the easy life. Keep it. What will I do with it? I can't sell it. Why not? Split the emerald, melt the chain. Sell them in Khitrovka. It's worth more whole, No. I won't break it. Well then, I'll be going. At least let me kiss you goodbye. Farewell. Farewell. Countess! I appear to have lost my watch. Fair game, Gilly. It's my trade. Indeed, so it is. Keep it!
