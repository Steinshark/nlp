Truett Cathy, naming his restaurants after his famous Uh, &quot;'chick'&quot;--(laughs) it was a quote-- - &quot;'chick' to represent our juicy chicken, and 'fil-A' as a play - [Ja] Oh, wow. [Ja] I don't know [Jo] Is that it? I was... [Jo] We were talking about it. something... [Jo] Just a play on words? [Ja] Yeah, and then there's a cow. - [Ja] For some reason. [Ja] I'm Eat Mor Chikin, the cow. - [Jo] Hi. - [Jo] Nice to see you. - Brian David Gilbert in Um, Actually. - [Jo] The Wikipedia guy. [Jo] Out of that little room - [Ja] Yeah, he's in his little bedroom. [Ja] &quot;Who's the guy who started - [Ja] And then that's it. [Jo] &quot;Pretty cool!&quot; - [Jo] How you doing? What's up? [Ja] I come [to] you bearing great shame. [Jo] Oh, was the diss track about you? [Ja] (laughs) Kendrick hates my ass. [Ja] He said some really [Jo] But also, that was actually my idea. [Ja] I actually planted it. &quot;Here's all the bad things about me.&quot; - [Jo] Now everyone thinks I'm a predator. here's all the bad things [Ja] I'm not the one [Ja] I mean, Jarvis is [Ja] It's really hard to not [Jo] Oh, sorry; had to change pens. - [Jo] I ran out. [Jo] Don't remember what I wrote--ohh, I should've crossed out the [Ja] Definitely don't talk about [Jo] That little line, like, - [Jo] You fly off a bridge. [Ja] (laughs) Yeah. I drive into a bridge. - [Jo] You come bearing...? So, last night I went to drinks Um, however... (sighs) I came home. And... - I ordered not one, - but two Uber Eats orders. - Concurrent? 'Cause I was getting impatient. - [Jo] Same thing? - [Jo] Oh. - [Ja] It's worse. [Ja] I ordered--I ordered Wingstop. I've never seen this - [JARVIS] I'm so sad. - [JORDAN] Your hands are held-- - I guess put in a separator between us. So, I ordered Wingstop. (laughs) I'm gonna start crying. Um, I ordered Wingstop, and then the Wingstop And then I ordered - [JORDAN] A little bit. And so then... (laughs) The worst which is I ordered one of them and then the same man - delivered both orders. [Ja] Which I didn't because I feel like I shouldn't if the same-- - if Roger shows up with both bags! [Ja] And then, you know, [Ja] His real name's - [Jo] What's his real name? - [Jo] Oh, OK. Close enough. [Ja] I'll never tell. [Ja] Um, and, uh... [Ja] And so Roger shows up, and he goes, &quot;I got two orders for you!&quot; And I'm like, - &quot;You don't have to tell me...&quot; - [JARVIS] &quot;...what I've done.&quot; - [JARVIS] Yeah. [Ja] Yeah. My homie. - [Jo] &quot;My... friend.&quot; [Ja] (laughs) I did go on a date (laughing) I said I was and she said, &quot;Is that - [Jo] That's a really good point. [Ja] And I was like, [Jo] You could be [Ja] &quot;I was just hanging out with my--&quot; - That's not my parlance. (laughs) Tried to say it &quot;That's not my vernacular.&quot; &quot;That's not quite the dialectic - Yeah. But, um... - (laughs) &quot;Buddy, bucko.&quot; &quot;Sport&quot;?! - [Jo] White people got a lot of words. - [Jo] Underrated. &quot;Sport,&quot; underrated. Yeah, and so I thought And then I did eat them both. [Jo] Same time? Like kind of a...? [Ja] Yeah, it was kind of [Ja] It was like I kinda went to town. - [Jo] That's kind of appealing. [Jo] You wearing sunglasses, - [Ja] I made them both kiss. [JACOB] Pretty cool movie. - [Ja] Oh, really? It's so good. But yeah, so... - You're a pervert. What the hell? The shame is in that it was This is like a problem I have. Where it's like But it was midnight and so all of my inhibitions were down. And that's the worst way for me to be. I need my inhibitions up. I need the... I need the AT Field surrounding me. - I need the defenses at maximum. I can't feel the rain on my skin. (laughs) No, this is-- Much like my letter to Kendrick Lamar, written, and not &quot;Unwritten.&quot; By Natasha Bedingfield. I will give you, uh, as I guess a priest? Is that who listens to - Yeah, the king. - The king of the church. you can just give them a number - &quot;You're covered.&quot; - &quot;Hey, 2,000 Hail Marys.&quot; [JORDAN] Yeah, you have to and then head to Megaton. Is that in the show? I have only watched And I had to stop. - Because-- - [Ja] (laughs) I got nervous. [Ja] I was like, - [Jo] &quot;This guy looks nasty!&quot; [Ja] I had to stop because... [Ja] I have a gigantic one of the lead actresses of the show. [Ja] And it started making me sad that she'll never know who I am. - (Jarvis laughing) - [Jo] We've brought her here todaaaaay! - [Jo] Oh, she was killed by radiation. - [JORDAN] Now she's a ghoul. No, but I did watch the I feel that way about, uh... (laughs) I legitimately feel that way I'm like, &quot;I'll never get to - [JARVIS] Yeah. I... that's how I've started how I'm starting to feel I'll be like, &quot;I want $50 million a year.&quot; &quot;What haven't I done?!&quot; - &quot;Why can't I have that?!&quot; &quot;Imagine the Uber Eats &quot;I could order three things And then Roger shows up and he goes, He's carrying three bags like he's trying - and he's stumbling. And the places were So Roger just took a Who won? Franchise-wise? I used to live next to a You know what? other than McDonald's, the closest, uh, fast food to me, and I've been adopting it more and becoming more and more... familiar with the menu. Guys, loop that into the triangulation that we're working on on Jarvis's address. Don't forget. Let's--can I do the first line? - [Ja] No! That's the most important line. - [Ja] That's the line with all the info. [Ja] No, that also [Jo] No, that's to send mail. - No, no, it's a zone. Uh, go ahead, guys. Do you know what ZIP It's, uh, Ze Instant Post. - (both giggling) [Jo] (French accent) Ze Instant Post? - [Ja] Ze Instant--! [Ja] I don't know, but I never thought about it I assumed it was, you know... It might not be an acronym, Let me see. This is one of - Oh, Zone Improvement Plan. - [Ja] Yeah. [Jo] That's way far off [JACOB] I would've guessed they - [Ja] Yeah. - We have to do something.&quot; they don't have a system like that, Or it's hard to... deliver things, or to know where things - are supposed to be delivered. We're not allowed to say that. [JACOB] 90210, baby. - [Ja] Ayy. [Jo] Yeah, guys, go ahead and 'cause we did that as a joke. No, no, we are in Beverly Hills. Say that. - [Jo] Eh... - That's where I want to be! - Remember Weezer? [Ja] Yeah, that's [Ja] Um, so yeah, a ZIP... [Ja] Zone Improvement Plan. That's another one of where it just bounces &quot;Did you know this? I don't know for sure. - &quot;It is something, definitely.&quot; to say a falsehood. Um, 'cause I just don't wanna be wrong, and so I always go, And it'll be like [Jo] &quot;'Ey, boss, I don't know nothin'!&quot; [Jo] &quot;'Ey, 3 point-- [Ja] Anyway, how are you doing, buddy? I'm OK. I had a thought in my brain. - Oh, that's exciting. - (Jarvis laughing) [Jo] I have been preapproved [Jo] I know this was acknowledged [Ja] That's exciting. [Jo] I just want everyone to know [Jo] In case anyone was worried that I had been unapproved for a - [Ja] Right, but you got preapproved. [Jo] I'm doing pretty well [Jo] PayPal has, I guess, noticed. They noticed how well you're doing, yeah. - They wanted in on that. and they said, &quot;This guy...&quot; Oh, you're looking - [JARVIS] Yeah, I wasn't. [Ja] It said I was pre-disapproved. [JACOB] &quot;Hey, just so you know, - [Jo] It says &quot;for Jordan.&quot; [Ja] Yeah, &quot;Can you pass this along?&quot; Um, &quot;Perhaps you have a No, don't! - [JORDAN] &quot;Can you say it out loud?&quot; So, I have a lot of e-mails. - [JORDAN] Respect. - Horcrux situation, right? - [Ja] Can't catch 'em all. [Ja] So this is one of the [Ja] And I guess it's connected to TikTok. [Ja] Um, because I got an e-mail. &quot;Hi, Jarvis.&quot; And by the way, this is from... Roger. Oh, Jesus. He's bought [Ja] Yeah, he's like, &quot;PS, how was that new - [Ja] Turns out it's pretty good. [Ja] Not sponsored. However, (laughs) Jack in the Box, call us. 94105 ZIP code. - Feel free to-- That's right! We went to that thing. And at the time that I met Jack-- 'Cause we went to this event. - [Jo] Picture of Jack and Jarvis here. [Ja] I mean, it must exist. [JARVIS] So we were going to and they do, um... They basically, like, mash up fine dining with fast food. And so they'll do these, these little pop-ups where it's like and they make a really With the mission of, uh, disabusing me of any notion that, like, Red Robin could be that good in real life. - [Ja] Oh, yeah. [Jo] They're like, - [Jo] &quot;They won't deliver.&quot; and I, you know, got pulled aside to do a little video content with Jack and his box. Jack's kinda clout-focused. I'll say it. [Ja] He was like, &quot;How many followers [Jo] &quot;Show me your Social Blade.&quot; [Ja] &quot;Have you ordered - or did you order something else?&quot; - [Ja] &quot;Fuck, not Wingstop. I mean, shit!&quot; Uh, and at the time of I had not actually had Jack in the Box. And I didn't know anything And so they asked me what and I had talked to who said Breakfast Jack and so I just go, &quot;Ah, - [Jo] &quot;It's gotta be Jack's breakfast.&quot; I would have a... five-paragraph essay - [Jo] Is that what the e-mail is? [Ja] It's a restraining order - [Jo] The box. [Ja] &quot;Hi, Jarvis. I noticed that you (Jacob &amp; Jordan laughing) [JORDAN] &quot;I noticed that.&quot; I love these, man. We get so many-- [Ja] Like, if you have a YouTube channel, - it doesn't even matter how big it is. [Ja] You just get tons and tons of e-mails that just say shit like this. [Ja] &quot;I noticed you [Ja] &quot;With a US TikTok ban imminent, I'm wondering if you thought about [Jo] Oh. Which you don't have. [Ja] Which I don't have, yeah. some of the people [Ja] &quot;Can I send some case studies for the world's largest creators to see [Ja] I kinda do wanna follow up and ask. It's like a psychology experiment, because they're like, some epic viral bacon ideas?&quot; You know? And I'm like, &quot;Sure, I need ideas.&quot; - &quot;Some pogchamp le swag.&quot; &quot;PS, YouTube CPM is and there's no threat of a ban.&quot; [Ja] There might be a TikTok ban, [Jo] Wait, what's TikTok? [Ja] Yeah. But yeah, - [Jo] Not bad, man. - [Ja] Which is exciting. You're up. - [Ja] You did. - [JACOB] Uh, I heard. - [Jo] I didn't even have to do anything. [Jo] (scoffs) I've been pre--it's done. [Ja] No, you still have to say, - [Jo] You don't know shit. [JACOB] You can walk up to any - [JACOB] &quot;Put it on my PayPal.&quot; [Ja] You do it like a Jedi mind trick. [Jo] &quot;You want to go home [Jo] Uh, I'm good, man. It's been a funny... two weeks, I guess? I've, uh... - My partner has been moving. When I've said that, they're like, - [JARVIS] No. Uh, certified lover boy, - [Jo] No, no, no, no! - [Jo] Not certified. Not one. [Ja] We've gotta talk about that, Um, what a strange situation Is there a board that d--? Preapproved. - [Ja] It's the same people, actually. - [Jo] The PayPal one is for cool guys. - [Jo] No, they're unrelated. But yeah, there's, um... We had... I popped it on the board. We've been engaging - [JARVIS] OK. - [Jo] With friends. - [Jo] Yes. [Jo] Which is--but my partner, um, moving means she's been staying with me. Her and the dog have been staying And that combined with two, - [Ja] True. - [Jo] And then we had our birthday time. [Jo] And I feel like my, um... - cardio for hanging out has improved. [Jo] Doing it... you know, giving myself time to but pushing myself a little more - than I might normally. [Jo] I think the day we recorded We did, yeah. It was like but then we came back, 'cause... I had a different thing and so we were like, &quot;Oh, which is today, but it was last week, You, me, and Eddy watched War for the-- - War for the Planet-- - [JORDAN] Yes. - War on the Planet of the Apes. - [Jo] Dawn of. - [Jo] That order. - [Jo] No. and then just apes. [Jo] They had to set it up. [Ja] You gotta think about it [Jo] Uh-huh. Now... [Jo] My favorite actor. - [Ja] James Franco? - [Jo] He is certified. - [Jo] Unfortunately. [Jo] Uh... [Jo] Yeah, I've been in a coma - [Ja] Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop! [Jo] That's another thing. Actually, our group text-- is, I feel like, an extension We've been talking about the diss tracks. And it's been a really nice, like... 'Cause I don't know how you feel; - limited battery, especially... kinda relative to the week, and... - other factors. trying to figure out Yeah. It's like the first time and you're like, &quot;Ow! What the hell?&quot; - [Ja] I also have been doing that. &quot;That doesn't make sense.&quot; And it... Initially, I was like... &quot;I don't know. I already Can I go ape already?&quot; And then we just did, and it was like... &quot;Oh. Yeah.&quot; You just have to choose - [JARVIS] Yeah. - [Jo] We were the birthday bastards. [Ja] Um, to the point of today... we are... You know, just peeling back We're recording this episode, obviously. Afterward, we always record Patreon.com/SadBoyz. Um, for as low as $5. Not obliged, but if you fancy. Not obliged, but if you fancy. Never worry about it. (laughs) Please do not be guilt-- - I'M sorry. That's not why we're here. But if you are able And we also recently put out, um, some content from... Sad Boyz: Nightz which you'll be seeing more uploads from. In the sort of commentary video length of, you know, 15, 20 minutes. [Ja] Just so happened to be, uh, when we talked about Tom MacDonald for like two hours on Sad Boyz: Nightz, we cut that down into, um, - a little 20-minute video. - You know. - It's a concentrated derangement. Well, it's funny for us to make - [JARVIS] True. Jacob's had to do it twice. Running up the numbers by which Jacob has [JACOB] Half of his views are just me. - (both laughing) who's saying, &quot;Normally, &quot;Usually it's spelled with a After that, we are recording a monthly show we do for our $15 patrons. And this is even omega But we'll do a little extra react. Um... But it's there if you're really We have a monthly watchalong, You've seen us do tons of so this is just like more of that. But the reason I mention that and that's a little experiment. But then after that, Jarvis has a big day. After that, I'm going to get a haircut. Just a little, uh... just a little... um, cleanup. - Fuck, I was supposed to do that. Rats. I also do need to-- I need to wash... a shirt... for something we're filming tomorrow that people will... may not see by Friday, so I'm not sure? - [Ja] So we don't wanna announce it yet? [Ja] Probably not, 'cause [Ja] But anyway, we're filming [Ja] It'll be exciting. People are But it's a day. That's a whole shebang. Uh, but then after that, - [JORDAN] Oh, really? - once or twice a week. - You do not wanna film this thing. End of day, you'll be boxing So, I've been trying to become - [JORDAN] Yes. Well, that's also why I'm so sad about-- I'm gonna forgive myself, And I only say this because But I've been eating drinking my Liquid IV for my hydration. Oh my God, I'm so hydrated, dude. - I haven't had soda in a while. - Respect. but... I've been trying to just stick to water and then my Liquid IV for my workouts and stuff. [Ja] Um... and last night I was drinking, so I drank Liquid IV for like... make sure I was not dehydrated. [Ja] Um, but I'm just trying to get... [Ja] I'm trying to go fit mode. - [Ja] Trying to... [Ja] You know, birthday just came along. We're now both in our dirty 30s. - [Ja] Emphasis on the &quot;dirty.&quot; [Ja] Um, so I also started - That's right. You're the ball bastard. - With the Stanzes. - With the Yard boyz. - Yeah, with Luddy. - Who's the worst player? [Jo] Who should everyone message [Ja] Well, so... (clears throat) - [Ja] &quot;Nice ball.&quot; [Ja] Well, Hugs was there - and I was too. [Ja] Yeah, very yoked. [Ja] Oh, dude, everybody's yoked, man. [Ja] That's what I'm trying to get on. [Ja] Like, PointCrow is ripped. [Ja] Hugs is ripped. - A lot of sleeper bods. Oh, yeah, they were like, and I was like, &quot;I will be a shirt.&quot; Actually, I was on the skins team, 'Cause I'm like, - We'll get there. - OK? It's just a name. It was a lot of fun, Um, and that's good for a weekly thing, but then throughout the week just practice myself. Solo. It's a lot more fun for me 'cause I get so bored running. It's unmemorable, too. Yeah. And I still do need to do it, 'cause I need to, like... I think I'm about to become - [JORDAN] Oh, yeah? - You gotta pick a bastardly lane. The, like... I normally wear my, like, So I think I'm gonna - You're the time bastard. Time wizard, so to speak. Um... And yeah, so... Yeah, I'm just trying to... find more ways to keep Yesterday... I'm trying to I've been really sad, and I don't know how much - but, uh... but I think maybe - that space in between episodes. It's not like you woke up right before People are like, &quot;What do you mean, It's like, I'm depressed. - [Jo] We're just very good at it. the things that I'm able to do. [Ja] But there is so much more and I think coming to terms with that and trying to figure out [Ja] I wanna have a balanced life. [Ja] I wanna not be sort of [Jo] Yeah. And there's no value in, like, devaluing that feeling because or because you're valuing No, I'm so fortunate that, you know, I'm able to do the things I'm able to do. But, for example, I haven't put out and that's something that but it just is, and I have to accept that, and I have to, you know, um, figure out what steps I need to take - The solution isn't &quot;do it.&quot; - It's an easy mindset to get locked in. it feels as simple as &quot;do it,&quot; but acknowledging that, like, me doing something sometimes is like a series of wearing in order to get over that hump to action. 'Cause there's been a version of you It's not like you're - No. And there's like a &quot;I'm gonna hop in the car And now you get to play Right, and even before I went-- 'Cause there was a couple weeks, where I was talking to &quot;You gotta come out and play with us.&quot; And I was like... - [Jo] &quot;Don't tell me what to do!&quot; - (Jordan laughing) - [Jo] &quot;Ahh, I'm dead!&quot; - [Ja] &quot;But am I?&quot; [Ja] The... but I had this &quot;Well, I haven't played [Ja] And so then there was I bought a basketball, and then I bought a little thing to inflate my basketball. And then I needed to find kind of solo, 'cause I don't wanna... A lot of my skills that I've been able to do in private. You know, when I learned the I did it alone in a room, and then I got good at them, and then I was able to put it on YouTube. Then I was able to show people at my You don't wanna be self-conscious when the thing you're is fun... and... It's not just the exercise element, right? Go, play basketball, have a really good, - [JARVIS] Oh my God, yeah. instead of just going like, &quot;I can't even dribble.&quot; Yeah, so I'm-- And it's not, and I wanna say this, uh, for anybody who's going through stuff... right now. It is not a linear process, because I feel, and this is, um-- [Ja] It doesn't feel fair sometimes. [Ja] Like, my therapy last week... [Ja] I was in such a bad mood. [Ja] To the point where &quot;I'm so sorry. I can't do this right now.&quot; [Ja] Like, that's just what it was. [Jo] I think we were texting [Ja] And, uh--but... [Ja] The primary frustration was I feel like - [Ja] But I'm not seeing the results. [Ja] They're still indicting me. I'm still sad. I'm still, like, not feeling like I have energy. (sighs) And it's like, And it also is, um... [Ja] I'm just sort of speaking for myself, [Ja] I'm gonna keep at it, and I'm gonna [Ja] You know, like [Ja] 'Cause at this point, and getting the is a lifestyle change, because I've become sort of, uh, introverted ways. [Ja] Where I think like, when I was in San Francisco, 'cause as soon as &quot;I'm gonna start setting up [JORDAN] And also, I mean, living and working in an office so much, that's almost like your job Where, like, you can when it comes to hanging out with people. Right. I was getting so much, uh, - social cardio. It's like working at a gym. As a personal trainer, yeah. [Ja] But I was getting so much by just having side conversations, needing to jump into a meeting. [Ja] The, like, talking to someone face to face wasn't... [Ja] Like, I've never been [Ja] But, like... [Ja] I had so many reps, 'cause I was constantly whereas, into moving to a new town, uh... [Ja] &quot;Oh, surprise, pandemic, [Ja] &quot;Oh, I'm just spending all my time [Ja] I'm eating Dave's Hot Chicken. [Ja] I'm not feeling great about my body.&quot; [Ja] That's another detractor go out and experience the world. [Ja] And, um... [Ja] And yeah, like... [Ja] That created these current Where I know what my goal is and I just am only able to take incremental steps to get there, and I can't just jump back [JORDAN] Yeah. It'd be easier to &quot;Well, that was just a version and that's why more of the goals - [JARVIS] Right. It's always maybe a little... dismissive when people say this, It's easy to appreciate what - [JARVIS] Oh, of course. [Jo] Kind of been soiled by and sometimes it is dismissive, like, - [Jo] &quot;Eh, hey, things could be worse.&quot; [Jo] When in reality... [Jo] I mean, things but things can always be better, and there's nothing wrong - [Ja] Right. [Jo] There's those versions of ourselves, our... some stats were so much higher, maybe our spell slots, Our scaling was stronger. But now our WIS is so much higher, to the point where I remember... talking about... between the two of us, I know we would have or the impact of like, catastrophic impact. I feel like something... slipping up, a relatively minor mistake, that's like a sleepless night back then. [Jo] And now... - it's not that it's seamless, but there's... [Jo] You know, it's kinda and someone goes 500 feet in the air, falls off the skateboard, but lands OK. - [Ja] &quot;How did that happen?&quot; so many times... you know [Ja] Right, and you have the presence of - [Jo] Yeah. Almost not even on purpose. [Jo] Now it's like, uh... the low-ebb depression, which I know we've both pops up consistently here and there... [Jo] That is, I think, the hardest one to... get rid of, because it's just being tired. [Jo] Which, when something is-- [Jo] Generally, I prefer it [Jo] But when something bad happens, [Jo] There's something distinct about it, like, &quot;Well, when bad things happen, it's the worst right now, and then there are going to be [Jo] Who knows how long it'll take, [Ja] Yeah. But when those stages are over you're like, &quot;Well, shit. No one does, 'cause... each person's low-ebb, maybe part of but part of it's just like... fatigue. Hanging out [Jo] My psychiatrist asked me [Jo] He was like, &quot;How are you doing?&quot; [Jo] He's like... [Jo] (stammering) &quot;But these [Jo] &quot;Oh, yeah. That, this.&quot; I was like, &quot;You're right, I forgot.&quot; - It's been 6 months or whatever. and it's not... very easy for me to, um, give myself my own flowers, you know, for progress well-made. It's literally easy to criticize yourself, 'cause that's a survival mechanism. - We're supposed to. Yeah, the way my therapist I have this inner critic, and it has long outgrown its usefulness in terms of... it's... - I'm no longer fighting to survive. - Yeah. [Ja] It sort of is so ingrained that I am fighting against it, and it's like there's that are sort of borne of the critic that I have to, like... internally navigate. - You have to tell him he's wrong. inside of my own brain that's, like, putting up posters about You know? It's trying to convince [Jo] Your instinct is, &quot;I wanna - and it's like, he doesn't... [Jo] This guy's indocced. [Ja] Exactly. He's bad faith, - [Jo] Yeah. yesterday one of the Anastasia and I went to a [Ja] Um, tried to get out of the house, [Ja] Now that we have the office here and then I also live upstairs, which is great for 'cause that's not just another Uh, and it's great that but there is still something [JORDAN] Oh, yeah. That's like... If, uh, you know, hanging out with friends - is just straight-up going to the gym, intensive lifting session, then hanging out at an office is consistent cardio working at a gym, going and working at a cafe, - that's just going for a walk. It's something, and it's gonna [Jo] At the time, [Ja] It's literally like, down my street, in my neighborhood. - [Ja] I've walked down these streets-- - [Jo] No, of the coffee place. [Ja] I'm not telling you [Jo] Fine. I can't improve myself, then. [Ja] I walk down these streets but I never go into any of the shops. So I was like, &quot;Oh, wow, this is here.&quot; There's like a whole community happening. I saw, like-- I'm like a regular at this other brunch place and I saw someone who works there. [Ja] The barista probably recognized me; - it was a weird interaction. [Ja] No, it was like... [Ja] Anastasia and I sat down. [Ja] I went up; got in line. [Ja] I was like, &quot;Can I get this, [Ja] I'm drinking decaf [Jo] &quot;Hi, I noticed you [Ja] She was like, &quot;Oh, yeah, [Ja] I'm like, &quot;Yeah. 'cause there's lots of people here.&quot; [Ja] I'm PRETTY sure [Ja] And if I have, not enough - [Jo] Bold strategy. [Ja] &quot;Do I recognize you from somewhere?&quot; - &quot;How did you know that?&quot; [Ja] And I don't think - that said, &quot;Hi, my name is Jarvis.&quot; - [Ja] Not that day. [Ja] Uh, and I was like, &quot;That's actually a - that's sweet.&quot; [Ja] Yeah. Um... but... [Ja] That was cool, 'cause [Ja] I'm getting a little - [Jo] Going to the...? [Ja] Or working from the cafe. - or I would love to do it more. I guess you've been here a - [JARVIS] New spot. - [Ja] Little bit, but-- I was like, &quot;Oh, yeah, I think I had that briefly Uh, because I didn't know anybody But then everything shut down that I feel like I lost that. And I'm trying to kinda - I wanna be a citizen, you know? Instead of just on an island. - And-- I wanna be a citizen, That was actually bars. Uh, but yeah, so there was that, and I'm like, &quot;OK, let me give Uh, we came back; did some meetings. Then got a call that was a very emotionally strenuous call. Would have derailed me... - nine times out of ten... in the last, you know, few months. And I still had plans And somehow... During this call, I'm going, &quot;There's no - 'cause that's my instinct. My instinct is just to say - I canceled our birthday plans initially. I was feeling really sad on... Saturday--more like SADurday-- and then our birthday was Sunday-- Yeah. Then we found out I read the calendar, - and I realized I was stupid. BIRTHday. But then, like, I was... [Ja] I had friends hitting us up, [Ja] And it truly, like--Eddy texted me. [Ja] He was like, &quot;Yo, [Ja] Didn't cross my mind that my friends would wanna - [Jo] Yeah. [Ja] 'Cause I didn't invite anybody. I had been busy that whole week, I didn't make a plan. Anastasia came through in the clutch And then still, on Saturday, and then I just... Everything became too much, - I'm gonna punish myself for no reason.&quot; &quot;And I'm just gonna sit in bed and sulk.&quot; [JORDAN] It was... I think... The worst-case scenario, typically, aren't lifting either one up. But also... [Jo] You know, these are not new friends, but I think, uh... we have always, for a long time, been that other person. [Jo] And now it feels like Yeah. And that's the value of community! Shoutouts to, uh, Anastasia, but also Chrissy, - Oh, yeah. Chrissy's always... Down to be flexible. And, in fact, I don't wanna project or try and take a guess or anything, &quot;It's crazy that Chrissy just and I don't think that's true. - [Ja] No. she is just a great... [Ja] Different people [Jo] I think there's absolutely a world [Jo] Again, not diagnosing. [Jo] People that we know or able to just go... [Jo] I think they maybe just are really [Jo] Like when I have a... not super-close friend, but-- There's a handful of friends - and we'll end up at those fairly often. Often, those people think-- but they think I'm an extrovert. - [Ja] Oh, yeah. When I'm there. when it comes to that terminology, even, 'cause we all... contain dimensions or whatever. [Jo] But it's like, It'd be like if you got back &quot;Have you guys noticed that - &quot;He lives at this court.&quot; it kinda feels like a performance, go on stage. That's kinda what it feels like. Yeah. Literally, the live show, - now cherished memory. So fun. [Jo] But there's not a tool... [Jo] I didn't think I could get up - into that kind of mode. - [Ja] Right. - for what we're describing, a little bit. - [Jo] We just do it. most of the guests we bring on and it's like a... friends on training wheels-type situation, where we have a task, and it's to do the podcast, but then we also get to Or it's an excuse to hang out Eddy coming into the fold lately, - I'll give a shoutout to Eddy. - Um... - His brother, T. Uh, C. His girlfriend, C. But I guess to cap that off, definitely still in the thick of it. [Ja] But there are... [Ja] As much as my critic wants to... deny it, I am seeing evidence that I am building more of this social battery, more of this sort of... [Ja] I am making progress [Ja] And I can't, like, keep judging myself - [Jo] Yeah. [Ja] &quot;You're not at the so you're not making progress.&quot; [Ja] It's like looking at yourself [Jo] And you never said to yourself-- - [Jo] You know. Today. [Jo] You didn't set that - [Jo] It was a process the whole time. Like, if you just... If we don't put out the episode tomorrow, it's like, &quot;Well, we don't do Thursday. That's not when we put it out. Yeah, we had a couple episodes where, uh, we put them out on Monday, because I needed to do and I couldn't get myself And that's OK. (laughs) [JORDAN] It's just an Yeah, and, um... And everything is still in progress, and everything is still, you know, building up and, uh... Yeah. It's OK to not always be perfect, and that's, I think, the lesson. And sometimes just setting - a huge step. Like, &quot;Here's my goal.&quot; get disappointed when they - [Ja] Mmhmm. typically pretty big role. [Jo] Like, even deciding to quit - big step towards not smoking anymore. Also, you can relapse five years and it doesn't mean that [JARVIS] Yeah. You know, that's, um, a little bit how I feel about... Not that I've ever, uh, a substance that wasn't food, um, but I do have a And... I think that-- I lost like 50 pounds from age, like, 21 to, I don't know, 22, 23? - Oh, yeah, it was after college. Let's see. When was it? I was at Yelp still, yeah. So it was like right after college... [Ja] I started losing weight. [Ja] Or no, it was during college. - [Jo] You guys do 4 years, right? [Ja] I was starting to lose weight. [Ja] And at the beginning I was like the weight I am now. [Ja] And so I'm like... 50 pounds delta from what I feel is [Ja] But then in the pandemic, unhealthy habits, and [Ja] A lot of people did, and I think [Ja] But just doing all of and all of these things where, like, my body composition has changed, so it's like I don't look - It's distributed differently. - It's like a second puberty. where it feels like this big failure, that I kept off this weight and then this global - [Jo] Mm, allegedly. [Ja] And of course my problems in But in the sort of localized experience with my own self and my own mind, it's very, um... scary? And the fact that your body has changed - And our different ages, etc. But the number, the very specific number - has been there-- [JORDAN] Yeah. It's like a-- It's like it could be ten years but you remem-- Do you have that thing &quot;I'm just in a weird mood today,&quot; and you have no idea what day it is, and you look and go, - [JARVIS] Yeah. looking at the scale and - [JARVIS] Mmhmm. - I don't like it.&quot; - Um... Uh, yeah, and I think I'm not... I think the thing that... I would tell people... is that for me, a very personal experience, so I can't extrapolate it, But one skill that I have developed and what's changed since I was younger and did lose that weight and stuff... is that I've gotten [Ja] I think that that is a muscle, and it becomes easier to, like... let yourself off the hook when you're trying and you're [Ja] And, um, I think and so that's why I joke, but that's why the Wingstop Jack in the Box thing is shameful, and I am letting myself off the hook because that's the, like... a very genuine feeling. - I go, &quot;Why did I do that?&quot; - Um... I mean, clearly comedy's something - Yeah, of course. You know, a little bit of ego death in being like, &quot;How silly is this thing?&quot; &quot;This thing, yeah, I feel it. But also, at the same time, hey. Uh, whoopsie-daisy,&quot; you know? And recognizing that it doesn't change the way that really - Other than myself. You know, like I think Eddy not to sort of-- I don't wanna air out too many but just about how-- [Ja] I think you'd speak to look like an unhealthy person. [Jo] And I think it's back to what we're told is the priority, which is trad attractiveness, or - Right, of course. we know that's not actually - For sure. and what you're not accounting for, is, uh, your sense of style has improved, or you figured out your hair. Yeah, just the way you carry yourself, And confidence does go a long way, And forgiving yourself for, like, you know? Like, it's forgiveness... like, literally very in that, &quot;Well, I'm going to if I do believe that they're And there's some behaviors and there's others where I'm like, - a bit more stern. [Jo] &quot;I'm not gonna hate myself, [Jo] This was slap-on-the-wrist is a little--you don't wanna be too stern. [Jo] But it's almost like - an adult to an adult. kind of... [Ja] the insecurity stuff is unproductive, but it's inevitable, [Ja] And for me, one of those things, like, one of the first thing that comes up if I'm talking to someone and they like me, it's like, &quot;How can you like me? - I weigh this number.&quot; Isn't that insane? But then, obviously, but I do still... - hear those echoes. [Ja] You know, those critic put up many years back - stuck to the walls. [Jo] And the progress is - [Jo] It's like erosion. [Jo] I wanna see a big step forward But in reality, - you get .1% progress. have been carved over a really long time, and you kinda have to carve new grooves. [Ja] You have to build, - [Jo] Yes. and embed that in routine, and it just takes time. [Ja] I think a lot of cognitive like sort of untraining, uh, certain thought patterns [Ja] I think the premise of CBT is that you are like a... summation of all these thought patterns, or your brain is. [Ja] But anyway, um... [Ja] I figured that, - so I figured we can do that. [Jo] I like that ratio. So, um, going away from, uh, the Sad Boy portion of the show... [Jo] I've been preapproved. [Ja] (sighs) I don't know - [Ja] I have been sending those e-mails. - [Ja] I'm PayPal. - was a preapproval? [Ja] Like I send the ones that go, &quot;Hey, [Ja] Not great! [Jo] What's my real one? - [Ja] I'll never tell. [Jo] Well, I guess I'll never find out. [Ja] You gotta get a - [Jo] But you do know? [Jo] OK. Have I been preapproved? [Ja] Well, one important we are mourning something today. [Ja] We are mourning... the death... - of the Panera Charged Lemonade. - [Ja] They're getting rid of it. - [Ja] They're getting rid of it. This is our problem. We used to build things, We used to charge our lemonade. There's lazy lemonade now! We used to charge it I was gonna say, as soon as I got home, Panera Bread is like - [JARVIS] Oh, yeah. - Killing people? - It's like, uh... an angry worm. - It's supposed to be little. Like, when I interned in San Francisco... I was in SoMa. I was living in an apartment in SoMa. And on the ground floor of the And I would go there all the time, but it was just the most That's their whole thing, right? maybe a little less vibrant Yeah, Mendocino kinda has that too. - But the sandwiches slap. [Ja] Did they have [Ja] I'm curious about... - [Ja] I think maybe it's next to that-- [Jo] (laughs) Like, &quot;We have huge news.&quot; [Ja] &quot;Panera Bread is reportedly set which have been the center of [Jo] God, what an insane sentence. [Ja] &quot;When reached for comment, a company spokesperson that the company is leaning [Ja] 'We're excited to of our recent menu - [Jo] That's fucked. [Ja] &quot;Our recent menu transformation&quot;? [Jo] &quot;Did you hear - [Jo] &quot;We're excited, actually.&quot; into something that causes fewer deaths.&quot; [Jo] &quot;I've never been [Jo] What they can't say [Jo] They can't acknowledge [Ja] You know what's [Ja] This type of PR-speak, - it must be for investors, right? [Ja] 'Cause it's not for people. [Jo] Have you ever seen, uh, internal brand decks for, or often fast-food restaurants as well, 'cause it goes out to And they are, like... they're for aliens. [Jo] It's talking about [Jo] You don't need to sell me [Jo] &quot;Another sandwich [Ja] Yeah. No, literally. - &quot;No, we transformed our menu.&quot; &quot;Oh, how did you decide &quot;Well, we listened to more than It's like all these words I mean, not perfectly crafted. It's not like the god of PR [Jo] I think maybe if there was, we would've heard - Yeah. Yeah. I mean, 'cause I wanna read this part. But, um... [Ja] They did a survey, on the broad array of beverages ranging from exciting, on-trend flavors [Ja] I feel like &quot;low-sugar, low-caffeine&quot; is not in that press release [Jo] That is truly like &quot;We're excited to offer a whole new suite - of heavily-doored planes.&quot; - [Jo] &quot;Full doors on every plane.&quot; - not to fly off!&quot; &quot;We know that one was sealed up, and it wasn't a technical door. Did you see that a I--I can't-- Insane coincidence. I feel so... - What are the odds? You know what's really funny? Is that-- And remember, this is a joke. [Ja] This is a joke about [Ja] I almost said, &quot;Did you hear (both laughing) [Jo] 'Cause it sometimes Yeah, it's a joke. That would [greatly] that we incorrectly - would assume might've facilitated it. - Boeing would cut a corner? Why would they make an ethical compromise for the benefit of themselves? No, that's never happened ever [Jo] We're putting out a new gun - 100 times in the head! the way bullets fly through the air. [Ja] After surveying 30,000 casualties... [Jo] Have you ever noticed how the at a very specific time? [Jo] And then you fall off a cliff? But yeah, so I just felt like And just say, &quot;Damn, sorry this guy Um, OK, in other news... [JORDAN] Is the lem-- - [Ja] I don't think they have it anymore. I'm like, &quot;Can you just [Ja] Yeah. &quot;Can you charge it less?&quot; I think if I was a Charged Lemonade fan, especially if I wasn't and I just picked it up still and... I would think I'm having I wouldn't noticeably be like, &quot;I'm not buying this anymore! - &quot;I'm not shaking enough!&quot; In other news, Jacob prepared a TikTok trend for us to test. [JACOB] This is just a funny [JACOB] I feel like [JACOB] So, this is kind of like [JACOB] In the beginning, [JACOB] And this is &quot;top-teeth talker.&quot; [JACOB] She's exaggerating it. - [Ja] How do you do that? - [Ja] Are you supposed to sing that song? and then you see if your bottom teeth show or your top show when you talk. OK, wait. Play the song again. Where do the good boys go - to hide away, hide away? to hide away&quot;? OK. I'm gonna look into the camera. Where do the good boys -- Wait. I'm gonna do this natural.

Where do the good boys--my-- Go to my teeth, look at my-- - [JARVIS] Yeah, for sure. [JACOB] I'd say you're [Ja] I'm a... I'm a - [Ja] I think I'm a... [JACOB] But also, if you're a - [Ja] Awww. [Jo] What the hell? [Ja] OK, wait. &quot;I was convinced - I'm mortified.&quot; they were a bottom-tooth talker. [Jo] Is top teeth the consensus? Like, - [JACOB] I mean, yeah. - 'cause it doesn't mean they're abnormal. [Jo] Interesting. [Jo] You know what? [JACOB] So you can see [Jo] Look at the first comment. [Jo] &quot;Proudly a top-teeth talker!&quot; [Jo] 12,000 likes. [Ja] Wait, let me try to talk, Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away? I think I even showed my ...most people, the difference and a top-teeth talker So, if you don't smile, but then when you do smile - you are a top-tooth talker. So if you wanna be a top-tooth talker, [Jo] You know when I and me, when I sang Where do the good boys go? [Ja] Dude, that's tough. [JACOB] Jordan, when you're frowning, [JACOB] I feel like it also has to - [Ja] Yeah. - (laughing) Where do the good boys-- - with my teeth. It changes my accent. [Ja] I also think your 'cause I have big teeth. [Ja] Oh, dude, one of my... [Ja] I love... when people have big teeth. [Ja] Like, huge teeth. Not the - but just... [Jo] Not like when they're bigger - [Ja] Not like Steve Harvey's teeth. - [Jo] I mean, my whole life, I have had-- - [Jo] No. We'll socially shame him. - [Ja] It's fine. [Jo] I've always had kind of a-- [Jo I know we both have had - the straightness of our teeth. [Jo] And I just got - [Ja] True. I'll go, &quot;Oh! It's like a thing But I also learned, like, how far my Invisalign's gonna take me. There's some limits, unless I get some - But I'm very happy, satisfied. At no point in my life have I not found - Oh, yeah. my whole life, and without a doubt, still would look at myself and go, (laughs) &quot;I would, but no one else would, I think, like... Zendaya has technically not-perfect teeth, like I think there's not perfectly, perfectly - and she's extremely beautiful. Yeah, people love her smile. - She's amazing. Don't talk about... I mean... I'm just trying to get into Challengers 2. I mean, me and her aren't dating. - We da-TED. - Different British guy. - But I'm Spider-Man. - [Ja] Maybe in another univeeeeerse! [Jo] &quot;I'm Spider-Man in another univERSE!&quot; - [Ja] I think that guy-- I think that guy is [JACOB] Oh, yeah, he got robbed, right? - [Ja] He got robbed. He, like... [Ja] He shouted at some other... [JACOB] There was a video that came when he worked at Domino's - [Ja] I mean, hey. [Ja] You should tip, but look, [Ja] But I will judge him for-- - that was streaming near him. He was yelling at Doctor Octopus - for killing Aunt May? - where I'm like, &quot;OK, buddy.&quot; a big, broad statement However, if all of that other stuff was 'cause this is seemingly like [Jo] But it would've been - [Ja] Yeah. you have people in your life... who can be a good hang, who can be perfectly friendly , maybe even decent to work with, and then you hear something like, &quot;Man, I got my phone stolen.&quot; You're like, &quot;Damn, that sucks.&quot; And they're like, I'm like... &quot;OK. That's really unlucky.&quot; And they're like... &quot;I just had my...&quot; &quot;I've had 15 different good friends - refuse to talk to me anymore.&quot; And you start going, like, &quot;OK. These things aren't... but there's something about you Have you seen those people who have, um... Now, if you have a crack in your phone, whatever. If you have a couple, whatever. Have you seen somebody truly destroyed? - [JORDAN] Oh, yeah. And it's not even a case of, uh, &quot;I can't afford to get this new phone.&quot; I know people that will get a new phone... I've known somebody who would've covered the replacement; No, my question is just, 'Cause it's like someone who - Yeah. - [Jo] &quot;Just unlucky.&quot; - [Jo] &quot;No other factor.&quot; Yeah, I recently cracked a screen. Not my phone screen, but I think my iPad that, uh, is kind of broken. And when Dipper was Uh, he didn't, like... It was in a case. And, uh, like a soft case, so he bit into the soft case, that it, like, broke and also left this huge dent in it. So it's kinda already - But it's good enough. on the side of the counter &quot;I guess I'm really strong.&quot; It's fine. I'm not gonna They just announced a new iPad. I'm like, &quot;I want it.&quot; But then I barely use the iPad I have. I got a secondhand, like, $100 or whatever old iPad for manga only. And now that I'm not reading it, it's-- I need to take it off my Find My, 'cause every time I leave the house &quot;Did you wanna take your iPad with you?&quot; - [Ja] Not without your iPad. - [Jo] What is it? [Jo] No, the... the address. - [Ja] I know. so we can find the coffee place? [Ja] I'm gonna plead the Fifth. [Jo] Jacob! Address. Yours. [Ja] Speaking of, uh, let's talk about Oh, what a week. What a wonderful week, with some of the most [Ja] Can you pull up &quot;Not Like Us,&quot; Jacob? Because Kendrick is not claiming people... uh, who are using his music, So we've gotta take sides is question, which he knows in general, whole way through, anytime somebody disses Drake, they - [JARVIS] Mmhmm. mostly pretty low-key beats, &quot;Kendrick doesn't have hood credentials,&quot; and then he releases - [Jo] It's so cool. &quot;Oh, Drake's thing is he makes songs, - and so they're more listenable.&quot; And then Kendrick's like, &quot;Me too.&quot; [Ja] Actually, as of today, the... [Ja] &quot;Not Like Us&quot; has now broken a record for, like, most streamed The way some people I think would be a more where it's like, &quot;This is He's kinda alt. As famous [Jo] I'm like, &quot;This is... no. [Ja] Yeah. I mean, but yeah. What was background with Kendrick; [Jo] Uh, huge, enormous, I was one of the grumpy... DAMN dislikers, a little bit. But when I say &quot;dislikers,&quot; but &quot;This isn't what or I was underwhelmed, and I'm like, &quot;This is fucking great. [Jo] And then when - [Jo] &quot;Everyone's perfect but me!&quot; [Jo] But even then, I was like, [Jo] &quot;I want another M.A.A.D City.&quot; he's given me a lot of artistic direction-- [Jo] Not in what I make, [Jo] I felt like and exploring and experimenting, 'cause it challenges me. and then I, like, &quot;Oh, &quot;I didn't know the ligaments here. And, uh, Drake, I feel like in more or less the same place. [Jo] But for me, Drake is... you know, like a fun pop artist. - [Ja] Yeah. [Jo] He kinda... when artists and people I'll compare to Elon Musk, not that Elon Musk has anywhere near the Though Elon Musk did just follow Drake. [JORDAN] Oh, maybe he's leveling up. Uh, he started listening to rap, He said, &quot;Normally I don't like rap music, (as Elon) &quot;Normally, I don't like that &quot;I don't think it's particularly cogent.&quot; &quot;I don't like this (beeeeee) kinda music.&quot; But it's like... Drake holds as Elon for the last &quot;You're doing fine. Don't be insecure.&quot; &quot;Stop looking for approval from - &quot;You can just be you.&quot; Like a lesser version of LeBron - [JARVIS] Oh, yeah. LeBron's version of it feels like [JORDAN] Oh, yeah. I mean, He hasn't done--well, sorry, no. - Hasn't done harm elsewhere. Like, &quot;Just go away; [Jo] &quot;Go away&quot; in the sense of, like, - with the albums you're into.&quot; - [JORDAN] Yeah. when you reach that stage, how you-- I feel like they become And then it's like, the things end up not having [Ja] For me, I am an old Drake fan. - I... I really like-- - It's gotta be above. I listened to the first Drake mixtape, I listened to the second Listened to the third I was a big fan of Thank Me Later. I was a big fan of, uh-- Of his best album. - Oh, If You're Reading This? Um... oh, Take Care. Um, so, big fan of Take Care. And then, around This was 2013. - It's when I'm starting to fall off. It's when he's starting I'm liking Drake features here and there. I casually see blips. But I was always a fan of Drake rapping. It's funny that this is about a rap beef, 'cause I was always and I was never really - It kinda annoyed me. And I feel like even So Far Gone is when he's starting to mix that a lot. That's like his mixtape Well, I've always felt like he... spent his remaining resources - and was like, &quot;Here's what I can do.&quot; [Jo] Like, dabbling back and forth. [Jo] And I respect him kinda like the Kendrick thing, although not in a way I that much enjoy. But I've never really &quot;He's just catching a wave.&quot; [Ja] Well, I can't speak for but I know that around yeah, If You're Reading This into Views... [Ja] I liked a few songs on Views. [Ja] But it's like [Ja] Same thing happened with Maroon 5, except for it happened [Ja] Like, after Songs about Jane and after, uh, um, their first two albums, I started to divest myself, - and now I'm completely out. - And I don't know. Did they kinda go the same route as Drake, where they became kinda singles artists, - like the albums didn't have that much-- this pop-funk, like, record. And it's great. And then, like, they're but there's instruments, there's guitars, They're like a band. And then they slowly became... - &quot;What is this?&quot; &quot;This is all, like, synthy arena pop,&quot; that's like Target, mall pop, you know? - [JORDAN] Yeah. Fun, Imagine Dragons. Yeah, even that--I don't know. But it's, I think, even more plastic than any of those artists. And I love, like... You know, I loved and I loved Britney Spears so I'm no stranger Pop, pop! Shoutout. - Uh, Magnitude. Um, the... I think--I admire, I think loyal to the... - the output, not the trend. Approving of and being engaged with... uh, boy bands is something that I felt - so unwilling to do. I would really enjoy a song, but, &quot;Actually, I can't even like And I'm like 15. - It's way too late to care. And I never was fully on that trend, [Jo] Yeah, it was, you know... listen to a lot of music, and you wanted something to say... [Ja] But at a certain point, where, like, he would just bring-- [Ja] Like, a young artist would come up, and then Drake would hop on a feature, sometimes would just and then would try to sign people, but then when he would sign people - [Jo] Yeah, they would... like, writers at the [Jo] Ritual symbol on their back [Ja] Yeah, or he stole, um, - &quot;Hotline Bling&quot; from DRAM. To the point where it comes out on Apple Music as, like, &quot;Cha Cha Remix,&quot; and then they rework it and it &quot;Oh, no, it wasn't related &quot;This is an episode of NPR. And then the weird stuff with minors and then I was just like, I'll hear the... I'll like a song here and there. I'll like the features But he's not even rapping that much. So, every now and again, I would be like, &quot;Oh, I like this,&quot; Um... And then, at this point, every Drake record that - and I'm like, &quot;(scoffs) OK.&quot; [Ja] Or there'll be one song that I like. - [Ja] I liked &quot;First Person Shooter.&quot; [Ja] And I'm a big J. Cole fan. [Ja] And that's why this has been-- [Ja] That's why the beginning [Jo] Which, let me tell you, even for the five seconds I clowned on J. Cole for apologizing... almost immediately after, I'm like, &quot;Well, no, that's pretty sincere, In the same breath, you did kinda say, &quot;Hey, I mean, I respect it.&quot; He's doing a thing that's harder. And it's fun to joke about it, but it's not like a response came out... like, after that, and he got... the shit kicked out of him, - [Ja] Yeah. it was corny and He put out a halfhearted, like, warning-shot diss track, where it's identified &quot;oh, are we really And his heart's not in it, - But then, um-- behavior as Drake He's like... he brings an artist That's so true, because a lot of his artists he's never stopped working with them. - Like Bas, for example, like, uh... [Jo] Dreamville is like an and is raising the kids just right. He's like Batman bringing That's so funny. And shoutout, uh, Bruce Wayne. Batman! Oh, fuck! Sorry. Uh, you doxxed him again. Dude, this is why I didn't 'Cause you don't want them [Ja] Um, OK, so... [Ja] Let's just go through and Future drop their album-- I'm going off memory, so I'm They drop, uh, We Don't Trust You. Um, which is their album. And then on that, that features Kendrick, and then on that, Kendrick... is mostly dissing Drake, but then he lightly disses J. Cole. He very specifically - &quot;First Person Shooter.&quot; [Ja] Where J. Cole says, &quot;they argue who the hottest MC, And is actually very &quot;Hey, who cares? It's great that There's a very funny, um... I saw a funny sketch about that, - &quot;Aren't we all amazing?&quot; or something. He said, yeah, &quot;We the big three, referencing Ice Cube's BIG3 basketball league thing But Kendrick's main thing there is like... you know, &quot;there's no [Ja] And Kendrick's done this before. [Ja] Like there was 2013, where he calls out everybody. [Ja] And he's doing it [Ja] He went on record what his intention was with that, is just to motivate everybody. [Jo] And he's also, you know, over time, I think, has had... a more severe version of the Drake experience you &quot;I don't... appreciate the guy being artistically exactly But he's not saying &quot;you can't He's saying, like, &quot;No, [JARVIS] And Drake is because he's... Like, a lot of his big songs are songs, and they're not rap songs. - They're not hip-hop songs. very early--well, but especially early in his career forming his, uh... It's like the formative He was... being bullied constantly - about his credentials. Some of it colorism, some of it just, &quot;Hey, this is too pop.&quot; He was making music for a That was the intent. And he's good at it. - And it worked, and it should exist. And that got even more clowned on, And it's like, this is not Drake's come-up, I think, Uh, after these mixtapes come out, he goes to... Why do I wanna say Texas? But wherever Lil Wayne was. And then they record a couple of tracks. And this is when I was in the thick of it, 'cause they recorded, that, uh, the names of which But specifically to Drake kind Lil Wayne is like, &quot;Be Canadian. Be who you are. [JORDAN] And Lil Wayne, he's bonafide... - He's hip-hop's hip-hop. It's him and, like, Doom. Even if you hang out with-- But if you hung out or associated with [JARVIS] Yeah. I mean, Lil Wayne going, um, &quot;Hello, hey, hi, how ya durrn'? It's Weezy F Baby, come to take a shit Um, but anyway, Drake &quot;I'm the same yellow boy can pocket 20 thousand And it's like, &quot;Oh, OK.&quot; We're Like, he's always talked about his... Blackness and his struggles But you could tell - that it's an insecurity. [JARVIS] Um, and then Like, super-fast forward, - where it's like... &quot;What is all this?&quot; He starts doing Patois stuff, and does Pidgin for, what, that one track? Oh, &quot;One Dance.&quot; [Ja] So then, after that, you have... um, J. Cole dropping &quot;7 Minute Drill.&quot; Then Drake drops &quot;Push Ups,&quot; which I liked when it came out. I listened to it a bunch. He had to respond to a lot of people, Rick Ross and all these And it's so funny that, like... 'Cause it was like the 20v1 thing. [Ja] So at that point, it's like, Kendrick hasn't had a second response. But then, Drake makes... - the first big self-own of the beef. [Jo] He pulls the--he releases &quot;Push Ups,&quot; and then, next day in the shower, - And I feel like &quot;Push Ups&quot; was fine. - It's enough to respond to. But Drake said, &quot;That's not enough. I need to do the &quot;I've told the guy he's short - [JARVIS] Yes. He says, &quot;I told him, Um, and then he made which was an Instagram-only release because he obviously could not He used deepfake voices - for Tupac and for Snoop Dogg. I never heard Snoop Dogg's response. Oh. Snoop Dogg's reaction is still up? - (Jordan laughing) [Ja] Wait, can I read this headline? [Ja] &quot;Snoop Dogg reacts to Drake's new - [Jo] That's actually perfect. [Jo] That should've been Drake's They did what?! When? How? Are you sure? (sighs) Y'all have a good night. And to all... (laughs) Everybody calling my phone, blowing me up. What the fuck? What happened? What's going on? - I'm going back to bed. Goodnight. [Jo] This works really well [Ja] That's the reaction [Jo] I mean, it could be a reaction - [Jo] Or dying. Uh... [Jo] &quot;What happened? When? How?&quot; - [Ja] Uh, that's like... Kevin T. Porter has this joke that every time a white man is caught up in some sort of sex crime, he posts this video that he made &quot;I've heard a celebrity recently &quot;And he did some horrible, horrible things involving women.&quot; [Ja] It just... every time he just reposts that same thing. [Ja] Uh, OK, so &quot;Taylor Made really-- [Ja] Uh, no matter what he was saying trope that he was going for, - [Jo] Fucking so strange. [Ja] It's truly dumb. I don't know what... [Ja] And, like, it's a sign - by yes-men, because... because how could anyone let that out? [Ja] Um... just knowing [Ja] I get that 'cause he was posting [Jo] Was he doing it so that &quot;Did Tupac really say that?&quot; - [Ja] I don't know. Yeah, exactly. It was like, &quot;Oh, [JORDAN] Kendrick has the edit where [Ja] Yeah. And then he also has, uh-- [Ja] He actually used real deepfakes in that &quot;The Heart Part 5&quot; music video. - [Jo] Really? keeps changing to Kobe Bryant and... It's just... (laughs) I don't imagine that - about the technology of AI. [Jo] He is just really good [Ja] Yeah. [Jo And that's what Drake keeps - is being corny. Well, first of all, there were... People don't remember. - that were dropping. Like, &quot;Push Ups&quot; dropped 'cause it was unmastered. After he dropped another &quot;The other one was definitely - 'cause why would he do two in a row?&quot; People think that he was Trying to test the waters and see what I think... I think... if he did that for &quot;Push Ups&quot; - that would be insane to me. So, that didn't add up. There's a little bit of, like, people wanting to hate on Drake so much that they don't... that they literally, like, - don't give him any credit. And I'm like, &quot;That's fine.&quot; But then they give It's like, &quot;Kendrick actually - [JORDAN] Sure. &quot;Did you know that Lilo &amp; Stitch You know, like... um, so then, after &quot;Taylor Made Freestyle,&quot; Kendrick comes out with &quot;euphoria,&quot; which is like the big Um... Which, it's the, uh... this and the following one &quot;Ah, you fell for my ruse.&quot; - &quot;You fell into my trap!&quot; So &quot;euphoria&quot; comes out, and... It still doesn't go deep into some of the allegations, 'cause I think it's still [Ja] We're not getting too personal. [Ja] Like, he does talk about his son... - [Ja] Talks about, like, plastic surgery. level of, uh... &quot;Push Ups,&quot; a little bit. Of, like, severity. It's a pretty kinda... smack around a little. but this is a very delicate, like, &quot;Hey, kid. Fuckin'...&quot; bam, bam. - Little shove, couple kicks. I wanna get back into it. [JORDAN] I think people - Euphoria. - [Jo] What is that again? [Jo] &quot;I'm fake, and everything [Ja] Yeah, &quot;Everything [Jo] &quot;True,&quot; maybe. Richard Pryor, right? [Ja] Yeah, it's [Jo] It's batting him around, [Ja] &quot;I hate you and all the - [Ja] &quot;You have moles in your operation.&quot; [Jo] There's also, is the--? [Jo] The &quot;I hate&quot; portion, [Jo] There's like a specific - [Ja] Oh, I don't know. [Jo] Maybe an older Rick Ross diss? [Jo] Which is, like... also saying, &quot;I hate the way that [Jo] (laughing) &quot;You're annoying.&quot; It's just so much worse... than any kind of, uh... any kind of zinger. If I was having a back-and-forth and then they said, &quot;I don't like your You're mid,&quot; I'd be like, &quot;Oh.&quot; He does kind of allude... Uh, oh, yeah. There's, um... There's a lot of good lines. &quot;How many - like you're Black enough?&quot; Is this one the one - What was the consensus on-- with the &quot;Back to Back&quot; stuff... Was the Haley Joel-- Was it Haley Joel &quot;Osteen,&quot; - [JARVIS] Yeah. People said it was a mistake. Is there not something to it? Oh, he said... You know, &quot;[N-word] feeling like Joel--&quot; Just sometimes I choose not to, all right? [JORDAN] &quot;I'm not &quot;[N-word] feeling like Joel Osteen. Funny, he was in a film called AI.&quot; - So, maybe. - [Ja] 'Cause Joel Osteen is the... - [Ja] Is the megachurch guy. I don't know. It was like one of 'Cause I gave the benefit of the doubt to-- [Jo] &quot;To B-sharp?&quot; I was like, is that...? - [Ja] Oh, that was Drake. - [Ja] Yeah. &quot;You need to C sharper,&quot; or something? Like, given the benefit of the doubt, - but it just doesn't make sense. like, literally was coming up [Jo] Yeah. Of all the ones It's only one of two that doesn't exist. [Ja] So then &quot;euphoria&quot; ends with an interpolation of, um, Kanye West's &quot;Get Em High.&quot; - [Jo] It sounds sick, too. Kanye says, &quot;We don't wanna [Ja] But then Kendrick says, you know, &quot;We don't wanna hear [Ja] &quot;No more.&quot; And, uh, that started a few days of lightskin Black people can say and also not what [Ja] You know, he's talking about not being raised by Black people, co-opting it, blah-blah, all that stuff. [Jo] And playing into... his biggest insecurities. - [Jo] &quot;You're pop,&quot; which doesn't... no one's criticizing J. Cole, with also a white mom, By the way, lovely birthday treat Really nice for us in the week - Bookended it. Another track dropped as soon as I got to my car Dude, 12 Days of Christmas, So, then &quot;6:16 in LA&quot; drops the same day, so Kendrick drops again. Uh, and no one believed it, had the &quot;Back to Back&quot; thing. Did it really drop the same drop? Oh, no, &quot;euphoria&quot; was [Jo] And then Drake took a little Yes, and then Kendrick first at the beginning of the day. It was literally 6:16 a.m.; which was making fun of Drake's, uh, timestamp songs, you know, There's a ton of them. at least the early ones. Um... And, uh, and... He also posts the glove. This is the one he released &quot;meet the grahams&quot; after this. That is my number-one. - [JARVIS] Yeah. It is SO fucking mean. So, basically-- So, after Kendrick drops &quot;6:16 in LA,&quot; - Drake drops, um... Drake drops &quot;Family Matters.&quot; [JORDAN] Which I legitimately &quot;Family Matters&quot; is where he's, uh, crushing the... the, like, Dodge caravan or whatever from Good Kid, M.A.A.D City. But it's apparently Apparently it's slightly wrong. - Um... the fact that there was a music video... makes it weaker for me. - [JARVIS] Interesting. I think that... You know, to Drake's credit, and I think that now that people are... uh, giving the song credit for what it is. Um, I think... sonically, it's like And then the music video he's crushing the and then he's also at New Ho King, the restaurant in Toronto where he got his chain stolen in 2009. And it's a song that Well, yeah, isn't that when he was a rat? (laughs) Isn't that 'Cause that's when he reported... Am I thinking of a different event? Uhhh... I mean, he... - did report those guys to the police. The guys who stole his chain That was something he got - [Ja] Yeah, which I don't know-- [Ja] I don't know what the-- [Ja] I'm not a rapper. - I'm probably gonna do something. [Ja] But anyway, I thought that [Ja] And then obviously, where he's accusing - [Ja] And, uh... - [Jo] That's like the big target. and that Kendrick's son is not his; it's actually his manager, Dave Free's. [Jo] Neither thing with any evidence, but-- [Ja] Yeah, the only evidence does not follow Kendrick on Instagram, and she follows Dave Free. And Dave Free is in her - and Kendrick is not. compared to what Kendrick The song got to be out I think maybe it was closer to 40 minutes. And &quot;meet the grahams&quot; is a full zoom-out of the photo that was, uh, the album art for... for, uh, &quot;6:16 in LA,&quot; revealing not only this Maybach glove, but some prescriptions for drugs, some jewelry receipts. - [JORDAN] Ozempic is one of them. That is made out to, you know, And then a shirt that, like-- There was then some... There was then some... internet sleuths this was all, uh, a &quot;gotcha&quot; for Kendrick, because the shirt is a Shortee Collection, and it's supposed to-- [Ja] It was like people were and being like, &quot;Actually, This was Twitter bait. Like, &quot;Go ahead. Hunt this down.&quot; Even if it's true, and he didn't play his cards... - correctly. So, &quot;meet the grahams&quot; is a big statement, because, one, it's written like a letter to every member of Drake's family-- Starting with his son. (laughs) He says, &quot;Dear Adonis, - (laughing) - and then his-- literally, just the &quot;Hey, um, sorry this guy's your dad. I think he should be killed. Um...&quot; [JARVIS] Oh, yeah. I mean, 'cause with the Adonis stuff, he's like, &quot;Hey, uh... don't cut corners like with plastic surgery. - &quot;Don't let anybody piss on your leg.&quot; &quot;Dear Sandra,&quot; he basically tells her she raised a horrible fucking person. And he thinks people like him should die. Which is a rare moment - where there's absolutely no wordplay. [Ja] And it's just like... &quot;I think you're horrible, [Jo] It's one step further than, &quot;I hate [Ja] Equates him to, uh, - Harvey Weinstein. &quot;They should share a cell.&quot; This is where all the PDF file, uh, - allegations begin. He's a user of PDF files. - And also has some PDF files in his camp. Um, and then also that, you know, - he has people, like, find women and... 'Cause he has his own internal tender, where he goes to a new city and he has his people [Ja] And then finally, uh, the last letter is to an unnamed daughter, an alleged 11-year-old daughter Accusing Drake of And that is still... That is still, uh... not, you know, proven. But what's really odd is that, in a song He was accused of Uh... among other things. He responded on Instagram being like, &quot;Bullshit.&quot; Oh, yeah, dude. I accuse you of... punching people and also - [Ja] I didn't punch anybody. - [Ja] I would never--come on. [Ja] And then Kendrick is, and all these songs and that was like, &quot;Hey, &quot;When's the last time somebody - [Ja] Right? Well, today. They were like, &quot;Actually, &quot;Kendrick fell off. And then he drops And, um, the album art is, like, Citizen app sex offender icons on Drake's house. [Jo] He has been on point - [Jo] I mean, that's half of it. a lot of stuff he's said before, Yeah. (laughs) It's club-worthy. So, then the other thing He's got the line, um... you know, &quot;trying to strike a chord, and it's probably A-minooooor!&quot; And that became, you know, a big thing. - And, uh... Section.80 Kendrick. - [Jo] That's just so--like fun, smiling... [Jo] Intense, but like cheeky? [Ja] It's almost like a wilding out... - (Jordan laughing) Yeah. [Jo] &quot;You're trying to hit a chord!&quot; - [Jo] &quot;And it's probably a minor!&quot; &quot;Ohh!&quot; I think people celebrate it, not because - because it's not, like, that insane. [Ja] Compared to, like, anything else [Ja] The fact that there's wordplay, and also the direct... callout of something that has been for so long about Drake, where - with young women. - And it's just such a dense history. That, again, it's... We're not equipped to make But at the same time, he's just - [Jo] That is logged. [Jo] That there is And so, uh, then Drake responded on our birthday, right after Very good title. And it's basically a - where he just says, &quot;Hey, no way, dude.&quot; - [Ja] &quot;Come on, that's not--&quot; - [Ja] The famous line is that if he was-- [Ja] Uh, he's too famous. [Ja] &quot;If I was a PDF file, wouldn't which is just, like, not... &quot;If I'm such a criminal, Yeah, which is just not how it-- Like, everyone knows Just say anything else! And also, you are not gonna by trusting the justice system. It's such a weird-- who is notorious for, like, rolls heavy--he's got a lot of - these keep getting through into these. [Jo] Is it no one's no one's pushing back, or, if they do, does he just go, &quot;No, I'm gonna say this&quot;? - [Jo] &quot;I'm not gonna change it.&quot; just rolled their eyes Which feels like... something else needs to happen. We're at a standstill right now. Except, well--asterisk. We're at a standstill between Originally, there was a, um, story about some, like, that UMG was trying to, like, - put the pause on things. But then TMZ, who's weirdly accurate with things that they They've done good rebranding. Uh, they said that So, who knows why things because a lot of things are unaddressed by both parties. And who knows if we'll ever see that addressed, but no one-- Basically, Drake didn't dissuade people from thinking that so they're just gonna run with that. I guess the best counter to accusations is not &quot;Uh-uh.&quot; - &quot;Nuh-uh, I didn't. You did that.&quot; &quot;Actually, that was my idea. We planted that, and, uh... oh, you believed that [Ja] The thing is, like, that-- [Ja] I still think that there is [JORDAN] That horrible idea The thing is, though, that it's not communicated... [Ja] The whole idea would be, It kind of hurts the credibility But the way it was communicated, so you told Kendrick [Jo] &quot;And that you had a daughter [Ja] I think they just meant it to be the Like, Drake's initial response his &quot;you've activated - &quot;And here's some screenshots.&quot; but all of it's just words, right? [Ja] But yeah, it's not a very - contractually obligated to try to, um, argue with it. [Ja] And so that's where on May... 7th? [Ja] 8th. That's where - [Ja] But! - We're all older because of it. - the only line dedicated to Metro Boomin, was, &quot;Metro, shut your ho ass up - and make some drums.&quot; [Ja] Metro answered the call, created a beat, and we're gonna talk music, 'cause we were talking someone made an AI kind of soul track. [Ja] Have you heard the original - [Jo] No. [Ja] I don't know if you have it already, in the Twitter search... BBL Drizzy! - [Ja] So, this is an AI song. [Ja] And, one, I just have to say how far AI music has come. - [Jo] Oh, yeah. which is very scary. [Jo] And the ethical decision not a &quot;and also, it sounds bad.&quot; - [Ja] Yeah. - getting in the way for a long time. I don't even think 'cause just, like, the song... like, got to him. And then, uh... And he didn't know who created it. But then he made a beat... sampling this AI song. And then created a contest, where people all over the world - can diss Drake to the BBL Drizzy song. And so we've gotten everything from, like, people doing classical Indian dance, someone playing a guitar solo over it, someone playing a saxophone solo over it. [Ja] And so then people are rapping over this beat in Japanese. [Ja] They're, like, teenagers just going in. [Ja] And so it's created this, uh, tiny army of diss tracks - on the BBL Drizzy song. Can we play the beat? BBL Drizzy! BBL Drizzy! Woo! - BBL Drizzy! BBL Drizzy! - Woo! [Ja] Maybe we can play [Ja] Since that came up first [Ja] And I really like that one. Even though they're not saying directly, - BBL Drizzy! BBL Drizzy! (like, Kenny G who??????) (as a society, we need to (this is a soulful, dreamy sax solo that's [Jo] What was it you said earlier when-- [Jo] Oh, you said Oh, yeah. It's got-- - You've got so much power. As long as you've got one within earshot. [Jo] Yeah, it's an anime counter. So, wait. Can we go back to give a shoutout to the author. [Ja] Shoutout, Tom Smyth, and then scroll down to the very bottom. [Ja] I wanna shoutout one of my moots. [Ja] Not to the very bottom, actually. Can you click on &quot;What Are We - [Jo] Is it British? one of my moots who did more in terms of the actual, And where we go from here. [Ja] Very well written. [Jo] Well put together. there's no response needed from Kendrick, really. There never was. But it's like a weird, uh-- The memes are still, &quot;Hey, remember and his response was bad?&quot; So there's, I mean, - Um, I just sent you one more... that was very funny to me. I know you see this glow-up [Jo] That's cool. - [Jo] Oh! There's a lot of lore. - [Ja] There's a lot. - [Jo] Be careful when you watch that. 'cause one, Drake says he's big in Japan, and he's criticizing Kendrick I think in &quot;Push Ups.&quot; [Ja] And then a Japanese rapper comes out and he's like, &quot;Hey, &quot;And OVO Tokyo - So funny. Like you could go 'round? - It was their merch shop. Yeah, 'cause they have They're getting vandalized now. People are spray-painting - &quot;Not Like Us&quot; on them. Yeah, it is. And also, we should note that in what is believed to be unrelated, one of Drake's security guards was shot. What the--? OK. Yeah, that's in relation to probably 'cause one of Weeknd's people was shot, and it's probably retaliatory. But... Yeah, so that's all happening. But that's our... That's all I got for this beef. - Beef review. Moo! I mean, it's-- Nothing has compared - It's been insane. without the bigger, this is like 20... like, early 2016 Twitter. Where it's just people... It's just Trump saying and then a ton of people And then the world became Oh, and then another three years. (laughs) [JARVIS] This is just like, um, the horrors of the genocide - There is something-- border, and just like... I think we mentioned it endorsing and supporting campus protests. Yeah. We talked 'cause we just forgot to Solidarity to all the campus protesters. Obviously, everybody And if that's something that, you know, instinctively bothers you, you need to rethink some things. Maybe get some life And also, I tweeted this, but, uh, just like, these protests are... um... Well, no protest is ever and everyone's gonna always have an issue. And specifically, there's always who are not the fucking But it's like, either counter-protesters who are trying to harm them and then you're seeing all these videos of police fucking throwing children And just escalating it on purpose. Uh, it's just, by and large, that is being made Which does not benefit the people Like, at no point has any of that &quot;Wow, I guess these protests aren't good.&quot; - [JARVIS] Yeah. Like, what? Sorry; by the way, anybody that has the instinct but especially the consistency and bravery and all the trials and tribulations have had to endure, and your instinct is to point to, like, conduct or politeness or inconvenience of students or something, you have a bad heart. [Jo] Like, your soul is worse, and you're permanently bad. Now, you I just want you to know... that no one will ever Because there is a pit in your soul that you can only ever perform to be good. - [JARVIS] Yeah. Yeah. So again, I've been posting some, um... uh, some bail funds and stuff - on my Instagram. [Ja] We can throw some in the description, just for helping bail out the students who are going to jail - and exercising their freedom to protest. [Jo] It's legal, but - [Ja] Right. Well, it's... - [Ja] Yeah. Think of the property! [Jo] They're being rude to my dad, Joe. [Ja] Yeah. Jesus Christ. [Ja] Uh, so we're doomed. But, uh... The beef is a fun distraction from that. Uh, it ended... It ended spiritually when Elon Musk responded to Akademiks with, &quot;Everybody's Can we click on this? This is the [Jo] Elon says, &quot;Everyone is - (both laughing) - That was Elon's birthday gift to us. Also, check Elon off on the-- but check him off Make sure. Two big X'es on it. So, lastly, we wanted like the BBL Drizzy song, is... much like just generative AI - [Ja] And, um... [Ja] Jacob found some, uh, TikTok accounts that are doing... AI stuff. And this is when we're showing this, or a service that I wanna show people, just to kinda understand where we're at. [Ja] But, uh, obviously we are on the side of creatives. [Ja] And in general, AI to enable creators - and not to replace. [Ja] But then in situations like this, you just imagine, um... like, bigwigs, record executives just trying to replace... [Ja] Uh, if you can make a doesn't have feelings. [Jo] Right now, there's just no [Jo] When we say it, like, we... I'm more than happy to advocate for, uh... AI tools... yeah, enabling creatives in whatever way. But right now, there's nothing in place There is currently - Like... Other than intellectual uh, train AI, but really hard to track down. And so you only see it when the AI accidentally generates, like, - uh... a Getty Images watermark. And you're like, &quot;Oh, Makes them a bottom-teeth talker, All right, Jacob, what do you got? [JACOB] I wanna show you guys really surprised me in terms of, uh, just how far the, you know, [JACOB] They have prompting AI to make a hit country song, - that I think is hilarious. [Jo] I get my license, and then loose lumber in the back of it, unsecured. [JACOB] I would love if you got a truck, [Ja] I was gonna say, I would - [JACOB] It'd be unironically useful. - [Jo] I would not do that, to be clear. - [Jo] Ooh. [Ja] No. - [JACOB] Is it Ford? [Jo] The one that I used? [Jo] For it? Or the one Yeah, it's a Ford Bronco. Yeah, just get yourself Hey. I feel like that's... [Jo] Somebody famous had one. - [Ja] Get on the highway. [JACOB] Did you see that they, - [Ja] Oh, really? [Jo] Mm, I don't wanna - [Ja] I think you bought it. spiked the value of those cars Yeah, 1993 one, too. Ford Bronco. The name Orenthal - Or went way up. Let's look at day one of asking AI [JACOB] Here's the first one. [Jo] (laughing) Yeah! [Ja] It feels like a Mad Lib. [JACOB] Yeah. [Jo] &quot;All I need is - [Ja] Yeah. &quot;Sipping on my sweet tea.&quot; - [Jo] &quot;Country drink.&quot; him saying &quot;banjo&quot; in this song [Jo] And I don't know if they'd say, - [Jo] That seems off-brand. - [Ja] I wanna hear more. (both laughing) (Jarvis laughs abruptly) [Jo] (laughing) This is-- - [Jo] Yeaaaah! trying to convince you [Jo] &quot;Oh, me? I'm just one of - your human countryfolk!&quot; and my big country hat, &quot;I don't need the city! I need these... - not-city--the normal street.&quot; &quot;I got my cow-noy hat [JACOB] &quot;I'll take - (both laughing) [Ja] &quot;Siri, navigate [JACOB] So then I think they just [JACOB] So these ones [Jo] What the fuck is that image? [Ja] First of all, the is a man in the bed of his truck with a bunch of beer cans. - [Ja] But his body is backwards. - [JACOB] His body is backwards. - but his toes are still pointed up. - where it's rotating around the waist. [Ja] Also, I have to say is a different era of - more old-school country. - [JACOB] Mmhmm. (all laughing) - [Jo] Oh, I was hoping he'd do that! (both laughing) (Jordan laughing) [Ja] True. (Jordan laughing) [Ja] It's funny, 'cause - um, really well. - [JACOB] Yeah. There's a Montgomery called, um, &quot;Titties and Beer.&quot; I think. (Jordan giggling) (both laughing) - [Ja] OK. - [Ja] Yeah, that's awesome. [JACOB] No, it's mud. He's country. [Jo] That's--ugh, this is wrong. (Jordan laughing) (both laughing) (both laughing) [Ja] I'm wondering [Ja] This kinda feels like - [Ja] And then sung by an AI. you know, include the line - [Ja] Yeah. - and none of the others. What are the other types of songs?
