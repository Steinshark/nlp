You have to repay me well. Wen Huihui. You're really too much today. Zhan An was proposing to you. How could you just run away? Are you with Zhan An? We've been waiting for you at the mall for half a day. What mall? Don't think I don't know. You two are already together. Let Zhan An answer the phone. Wen Huihui. I was proposing to you. What do you mean by running away? I had an emergency. You should have said something. Just leave. Let Lu Lu take care of you. For a while. She loves taking care of other people's boyfriends. What did she say? She said you're the best at taking care of other people's boyfriends. What does she mean? Forget it. Zhan An. Huihui is too much. I feel sorry for you. You're still the best. Will you still marry her? Yes. Why? She has 200,000 in savings. Let's get our hands on it first. Didn't your family's house get demolished? Why do you need her money? It hasn't been demolished yet. When will the money arrive? I don't know. How can I support you without money? The rent is over 500 a day. President Pei fell into the water. Mr. President. Why haven't you found me yet? Good morning, President Pei. Find the person who saved me immediately. Do you have any clues or characteristics? Her phone number starts with 188. Mr. Pei, this scope is too broad. Her name seems to be Huihui. Hui, as in flowers. She saved my life. I must find her. Huihui, my mom wants to meet you. We've been talking so long. It's about time to settle this. Meet the parents. I want Lulu to come with me. Our wedding. Why do you want her to go? I'm an orphan. I don't have parents to accompany me. For all these years, it's only been Lulu. Always with me. So I'm used to it. Anything, she's always there with me. Fine then. Xu Qinglu, don't you want to marry him? I will help you out. I have things to do. I'll leave first. Shi Zhan'an, you little brat, so you're here. When are you planning to pay me back? My house is about to be demolished. Once it's torn down, I can definitely repay you. You've been saying that for ages. Why hasn't it been torn down yet? Soon, soon. My fiancee has money. Once we get married, I can quickly pay you back. I'll give you two more days. Okay, okay, okay. Hurry up. Peh! Isn't it just 140,000? Once I have money, I'll throw it at you. Such poor upbringing. You showed up late to meet the parents. Aunt, please don't be angry. Huihui is just used to being late. It's my fault for not reminding her. To come earlier. I'll urge her again. Mom, this is all the money I have left. You can't even have kids. What's wrong with using your money? Hello, Aunt. Why did you show up dressed like this? My mom hates this style. Doesn't it look bad? You dress like this. Working at a nightclub? Oh, I just quit my job recently. I'm unemployed now. Can you cook? My son needs nutritionally balanced meals. When cooking, I'll eat too. What do you mean? Mom, she's just joking with you. As a woman, you must know how to cook. To have kids in the future. I didn't plan to have kids. I'm childfree. You don't cook and don't have kids. Why marry you then? I could learn. How much money can you give me from the compensation? You... Hey, Huihui, you're not even married to Zhan An yet. Why are you thinking about their family's money? I really don't have your level of awareness. If I could marry you, that would be so lucky. Mom, Her family has a 200,000 dowry. A 200,000 dowry is barely acceptable. Where does the 200,000 come from? Look at me, Is this worth 200,000? Zhan An, You brought a woman like this to meet me. Do you find me annoying? Zhan An, You typically live in this kind of family environment. No wonder you always told me before that you feel unhappy at home. Come out with me for a bit. Auntie, have some tea to calm down. Huihui just has a bad temperament. Her essence is actually quite good. This ill-mannered girl, Later, I'll make you soup. My soup is really good. Just been too busy with work recently, no time for it. You are still the best. So where do you work? At Pei Group. Uh-huh. That's a big company. Why does Zhan An have such poor taste? Do you have a boyfriend? Not yet. Then go get that brat to come back here. I'm going now. You're dressed like that to deliberately annoy me, aren't you? What I wear is my freedom. Don't interfere with me. My mom doesn't like it. Then go find someone your mom likes. Miss Wen Huihui, please get in the car. No wonder Wen Huihui has been so unusual lately. Looks like she's getting cozy with a wealthy man. Shameless. I said she's shameless. That's not incorrect. Getting cozy with a wealthy man. A wealthy man. I'm Wen Huihui. I saved the CEO. Line up over there. I, Wen Huihui. I know. Line up over there. I was dragged here without even changing my clothes. I can't believe we have to wait in line. Alright everyone, please come in. All those named Huihui. Those with phone numbers starting with 188. You all are here. You all take turns to explain. What happened at that time. It must be me. I studied nursing. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation. I did it very professionally. You can rule me out. That person's CPR. Not at all professional. You were wearing a suit at that time. The president doesn't wear a suit every day. Right? President Pei, you coughed up a lot of water. Can someone who's drowning not cough up water? How about you? I had a little. That can definitely be proven. What are you doing? President Pei, don't misunderstand. I just wanted to prove. When I saved you. I unbuttoned this. I saw you had one here. Alright, that's enough. It's definitely you. I remember now. Go ahead. What do you want? I promised you. I'd repay you. Isn't this the opportunity that just came? I just happened to quit my job recently. I need a job. Things are a bit tight right now. I see. I just happen to be looking for an assistant. Why don't you come be my assistant? Huh? Assistant? With a salary of 100,000 a month. I promise to serve you well. No need for any special services. Just do your job. Don't have any ulterior motives. What ulterior motives? Don't think that just because you're my assistant. You can be all hands-on with me. The interviews for this year have started, President Pei. Here's the resume. Give it to my assistant. Xu Qinglu. Huihui, what are you doing here? Are you here for an interview too? You can't even marry into the Shi family. How dare you come to Pei's for an interview? Nobody wants you even for cleaning. You're so capable. Then teach me some interview skills. You wouldn't understand this. Big companies require connections first. Is that so? Huihui. If my proposal doesn't get approved this time... It's never going to be right Don't you consider me a friend anymore? Fine Faking the plan Get out of my sight Xu Qinglu, you just wait This is my resume Your resume looks quite simple What do you think is your personal advantage? I heard Your company values external image I think I'm fully qualified for the job Have you done Any famous big projects before? I think Your company can provide me A better platform Huihui, I'm not done with the interview yet What are you doing here? Don't you know the rules? This person Can also stand up Do you two know each other? Actually, our company Doesn't value resumes that much Project experience We'll have time to cultivate it slowly So, am I hired? You're hired Huihui, this is the Pei Group What are you talking about? Oh She's the person in charge of the interview Don't worry, as my good sister I'll definitely arrange a position for you What position?

The new one, hurry up and clean She must have hooked up with President Pei Wen Huihui If you can do it, I can too Don't let me see her again President Pei, I didn't mean to Security, security This is the 20th one this month President Pei hates people like you Who think they're clever Can you transfer me to another post? I don't want to do this anymore This is the job I fought hard for For you I even got scolded by President Pei For this Then Just persevere Maybe if you're prepared... you might have a chance for a promotion. Who's that cleaner? Mr. Pei. That was brought in by Assistant Wen. She's her friend. There's a document that needs your signature. I don't drink coffee. What did you say? Nothing. Thank you, Mr. Pei. Get the documents ready for today. Another female employee wants to catch a ride. As expected, her true colors are showing. She's indeed different from the others. Bring in the cleaner that Wen Huahui hired. Call her in for me. Wen Huahui might use her charm to rise up. Why can't I do the same? As long as I get close to Mr. Pei, I can switch positions. Oh my gosh. I didn't expect Mr. Pei likes this kind of uniform temptation. Wiping a desk doesn't need to be this close, right? Okay, Mr. Pei. You were brought in by Wen Huahui. Yes, Mr. Pei. Have you known each other for a long time? Yeah. We've known each other since high school. We're really close. She has a boyfriend she's been with for many years. It's a pity, Wen Huahui, she doesn't know how to cherish him. He even proposed to her, and she's still flirting around. She even has a boyfriend. Is she trying to get on your good side too? She does this with every guy she meets. It's always like this. Mr. Pei, you have to be careful. She's such an obvious schemer. Looks like she's not a true friend. Got it. You can leave now. He bought it. Okay, Mr. Pei. Keep a close watch on the cleaner that Wen Huahui hired. Got it, Mr. Pei. Yes, Mr. Pei. Qinglu. I heard you joined Pei Group. That's impressive. I heard the Zhan family is being relocated too. That's impressive as well. Back in school, I thought you two were the best match. Who is the best match with whom? Wen Huahui, you have become so beautiful now. Come, come, come, sit here. Girls really change a lot over time. So beautiful, let's have a drink. Our Huahui is the prettiest. I told you two are the best match. Exactly, exactly. Huahui, where do you work now? Pei's Group So you and Xiaolu work for the same company? We're not in the same department. I'm an assistant in the president's office. So the president's assistant must be well-paid, right? My monthly salary is 100,000 yuan. Qinglu, which department are you in? It doesn't matter which department I'm in. Excuse me. I'm going to the restroom. I'll go too. Huihui. My stock market performance has been great lately. Can I borrow some money from you? I'll pay you back with interest. I'll return it to you. How much do you need? Is 200,000 yuan enough? Or maybe 500,000 yuan? Really? That would be great. Hello, I'd like to borrow 500,000 yuan. Qinglu. Yes. You must be thirsty. Here's a drink. Thank you, Linda. You and President Pei seem close. He's been looking for you a lot lately. It seems she's misunderstood. President Pei only asks me about Wen Huihui. He asks me about her. Please don't tell anyone. Okay. Don't worry, Mrs. President. Okay. We can use her to deal with Wen Huihui. Wen Huihui is trying to seduce President Pei. Lately, he's been cold to me because of her. He's been distant from me. Don't worry, I'll help you. Make a comprehensive fruit juice for President Pei. Send it to his office. Remember to remove the pitaya seeds. Take out the seeds. Make a comprehensive fruit juice for President Pei. Send it to his office. Remember to remove the pitaya seeds. Take out the seeds. So picky. President Pei is allergic to pitaya. You'll go in and save him later. Like this. This way, Wen Huihui will lose her job. Because of her mistake. And President Pei will like you more. Because he'll be grateful. If it succeeds. I'll make sure President Pei gives you a raise. If it works out. Thank you, Mrs. President. President Pei! President Pei! Are you okay? What are you doing here? I... I thought you needed some cleaning. President Pei, you're okay now. Thanks to Qinglu. She brought you medicine. It's nothing. It's fine. Wen Huihui. I asked you to make a fruit juice for President Pei. Did you put all the fruits in? What about the dragon fruit? You ate it yourself. You seemed to enjoy it. Come with me. Do you know they are setting you up? You mentioned dragon fruit. I remembered you-- are allergic to dragon fruit. So I made another drink. I didn't expect you to know me so well. It's in the assistant handbook. Didn't I write it all down? I memorized it all. The tasks you assigned me have been taken care of. You-- Wait for me outside. I have something to show you. Be mentally prepared. Uh-huh. It's a picture of Shi Zhangan and Xu Qinglu together. The quality is surprisingly good. The point is-- Is that really what's important? This is your boyfriend? Oh. Thank you, President Pei. I didn't expect the company to help employees catch cheating. You can tolerate this? Uh-huh. Love is blinding. I-- Assistant Chen-- Take her out. Please, Assistant Wen. Why are you so excited? I haven't seen them yet. Karma can't be avoided. How did you prepare the report? Where's Wen Huihui? She clocked out. She left right on time. There's still so much junk here. This is the lady with another man. Wen Huihui-- is definitely trying to ruin President Pei's relationship with the lady. This time, I have to help the lady out. So you're Shi Zhangan? Who are you, and what do you want? You're the one who's been bothering Xu Qinglu, right? Stop bothering her. She's already with our President Pei. Together now. President of Pei Corporation. Yeah, the richest guy, Pei. Don't be the third wheel anymore. Are you saying-- Xu Qinglu is with the President of Pei? Together now? Yeah. So I advise you to be smart. Don't humiliate yourself anymore. That little cutie, Xu Qinglu, is quite amazing. Crazy. Don't bother her again. I heard-- You're with President Pei now Who told you that Was it Wen Huihui She's slandering me I'm not with President Pei You're working under him every day How can I trust you I really didn't You believe me I believe you Then how will you prove it Unless Give me some of his good projects You can rest assured, I'll bring you good news Qinglu, you owe me one You don't know I've been working hard for your happiness with President Pei How hard have you been working What have you been working hard on I helped you take care of Shi Zhan'an It was that idiot Then work harder Help me get rid of Wen Huihui too Uh Wen Huihui can't be gotten rid of for now I still can't get rid of her Because she just got a big project This project is important I heard She and President Pei had a lot of conflicts over this project They had a lot of disagreements Why can't this project be done Let me tell you I don't want to hear it What are you arguing about You're up to no good again Nothing Remember to clean President Pei's office well It must be an important project I'll definitely find out A president The trash can is full of snack bags Where are the important documents Wen Huihui The Tianliang project is mine Zhan'an, you have to seize the opportunity I've arranged to meet with President Wang We have to get to President Wang before Wen Huihui We have to get to him first Is the Tianliang Group really that good Of course, President Wang told me The stock will definitely rise within a month This is inside information But I don't have that much money It's all in the stock market Take it out Think about it If we get Tianliang's shares It's better than what you're making in the stock market Take a chance Take a risk If we can become Tianliang's shareholders It's not bad Xu is here Come, come, sit down Do you like the gift I gave you last time Do you like it I like it, I like it Xu is thoughtful This is my boyfriend. Shi Zhangan. President Wang. I've heard a lot about you. The name of Tianliang Group. If you could take me under your wing, I'd be very grateful. There are too many young people like you. They're everywhere. Everyone wants a piece of my big pie. Even the Pei Group is begging to collaborate with me. Indeed. The Pei Group can't compare to you. Let me toast to you, President Wang. Cheers! How much are you planning to invest? We... 20. Xiao Xu, you young people really don't know the reality. You think such a small amount can make you a shareholder? Do you know how big my project is? It's massive. Brother Wang, don't be anxious. Just mentor us. We'll invest 30. Xiao Xu, the minimum is 500,000. That's the only way to qualify. I'm doing this to help you out. Just listen to me from now on, and everything will be negotiable. Brother Wang, so it's settled then. It's settled. How did Huihui do with President Wang? Don't mention it. President Wang wouldn't even acknowledge me. Don't be discouraged. If you lose your job, you can ask me for help. After all, cleaning jobs are everywhere. You help me, why don't you believe in me? Maybe the clients you can't close I can easily win over. We'll see about that. We'll be watching. Son, what have you been up to? Someone came to my house asking for money. Look at you. Shi Zhangan, 2 million. Did you spend it all on Wen Huihui? I told you long ago she's not a good person. No way, Mom. I've already given the money. What do you want? I've already settled the payment. Pay back. No, no, no. Let's talk this out. Having a woman borrow money for you, is really shameless. Pay your own debts. Wen Huihui, you've gotten involved with a wealthy man and now you dare to mess with me? What are you doing here? The money you borrowed from me was borrowed from a loan shark. They're now coming after me for it. You used the money, you pay it back. What's the problem? You did it on purpose, right? This slap is for the hurt you caused me. This slap is for the feelings I wasted. This slap is for the past Wen Huihui. Shizhan An. We're completely done. This isn't something you can do as you please. Wen Huihui, are you crazy? What's your excuse for hitting him? Wen Huihui. You have a rich man now supporting you. Is that why you're cheating on me? Wen Huihui, you're really too much. In the future, will you still dare to seduce men like this? What are you all talking about? I didn't. Xu Qinglu already said it. You deliberately went to seduce the guy she likes. How shameless can you be? Don't be like this. Huihui didn't mean to. Lulu, what are you talking about? I forgive you. I won't let them hurt you. My boyfriend and best friend are together. Who's being shameless? Xu Qinglu, you lied to me again. You're the mistress after all. You want money, right? I can tell you a method. You want to fool me again. Your mom has a large sum of money. My mom can't possibly. If you don't believe me, go ask her yourself. You've been fired. You finally see clearly that jerk. Actually, I knew for a long time. But I had my own plans. I realized it today. Sorry about that. I made you laugh. You're too polite. But you're pretty good. So, I can not only be a secretary but also a bodyguard. Mom, do you have some money you haven't told me about? Son. What happened to your face? Don't worry about that. Do you have money? Why are you asking this? Who told you? I haven't asked you yet. What about the two million? It's not, Mom. If you have money, why are you hiding it from me? My stocks have tanked badly. You need to give me the money first. No way. That money is for my grandson. Isn't your grandson my son? Isn't it only right that you give me the money? Don't even think about it. Without a grandson, I won't give you a thing. Mom, you really won't help me? How about this, you give me a grandson, and mom will give you the money. Otherwise, it's off the table. You. Son, where are you going? Son? Is this it? Doesn't look like it. Why don't we go in and take a look? Is this it? Is this Tianliang Group? Did you guys move to a new address? Moved to a new address and went bankrupt. How could they go bankrupt? I even have a meeting with President Wang today to discuss the contract. Another one scammed by him. What do you mean? The boss owes 3.5 billion and ran away with his sister-in-law. Are you joking? Why kick the trash can? I just cleaned it up. Zhan An, I didn't expect Tianliang to go bankrupt. But there's still the demolition payment, right? Once the demolition happens, there will be money. Demolition payment? What demolition? Even if the demolition happens, the money goes to my mom. My mom insists on having a grandson before she gives me money. Where am I supposed to get her a child? This is all Wen Huahui's fault. If she hadn't told me, how would I have known about President Wang? You still dare to bring her up? What do you have to compare to her? What do I lack compared to her? She graduated from a prestigious university, has a salary and savings. What are you? Comparing to her? I'm pregnant. Pregnant? Isn't your grandson my son? Isn't it only right that you give me the money? Don't even think about it. Without a grandson, I won't give you a thing. Lulu, I owe you an apology. I was indeed a bit impulsive earlier. Is the baby okay? We must... Take good care of him. I will take good care of him. Just fool him first. Once we have a child, everything of Wen Huahui's will be mine. One day, I'll take you to meet my mom. We'll tell her this good news. Tell her. Zhan An, you finally want to marry me. I've always wanted to marry you. Mom, I'm with Lulu now. You broke up with Wen Huahui. That cute little one. Ran off with a rich person long ago. That woman, I don't think she'll do anything good. Mom, I have something to tell you. Lulu and I have decided to get married. Get married? So soon? She's pregnant. Ah. Get up quickly. That's great! The Shi family finally has an heir. By the way, Mom, we should get married soon. Yes, yes, yes, get married soon! Aunt, don't worry, I will take good care of you. You really understand. As long as you give birth to my grandchild, you'll live the good life. You come to our family. I'm here today to deliver the invitation. Zhan An and I are getting married. As soon as Zhan An heard I was pregnant, he immediately wanted to marry me. Pregnant? Mom, I only have this much money left. You can't even have a child. What's wrong with using your money? Don't you have money yourself? Shut up, still thinking about my money. That money is meant for the first grandchild of the Shi family. You really dare to think that way. Your body is fine. It's your husband's sperm quality that's not good, that's why you can't conceive. She's lying again. You're not mad at me, are you? After all, you and Zhan An have been together for so many years. In the end, he chose me. I'm not mad. Then you have to come! Don't worry; I will definitely go. Get married. Yes. Xu Qinglu. Just now, she invited Wen Huahui to attend her wedding. Hey, can you hurry up? How long have you been getting dressed? We've all been waiting for you. This is too ugly. This was passed down from my mom Our family's daughter-in-law Must wear this And it's also cost-effective Does it really matter how it looks? Come on, hurry up I'll go greet the guests first You're here, take a look This is Zhan An's mom She specially prepared this wedding dress for me They really value me My mom passed it down Our family's daughter-in-law Must wear this And it's also cost-effective Does it really matter how it looks?

Why wouldn't I come? Xu Qinglu sent me an invitation I wanted to see What the wedding of a cheater and a mistress looks like What's it like? You didn't really think Pei Jingshen would marry you, did you? He's a rich man Just playing with you What's there to be proud of? You still have the face to come here Are you trying to seduce me again? Aunt I think I know Where Zhan An's confidence comes from It's inherited from you What do you mean? Ladies and gentlemen The wedding is about to begin Is there anyone who wants to speak first? To bless our newlyweds? I do As the ex-girlfriend who was cheated on I don't have much to give I'll help the bride Get to know the Shi family in advance The Shi family rules Men are not allowed in the kitchen It will affect the family's overall luck The daughter-in-law must remember Her husband's and mother-in-law's eating habits Every meal must have six dishes and one soup The budget must be strictly controlled within 15 yuan Three When buying things You must strictly pay attention to The discounts on various websites Cannot buy expensive things Four Going out should be low-carbon and eco-friendly No spending within 10 kilometers Taking a car People who don't know might think he's got a throne to inherit He really treats his son like an emperor Hahaha Isn't Wen Huihui, what are you up to?

Done on purpose to cause trouble I'm telling you Dream on, you I'll tell you too I really don't want to marry You don't want to marry?

Don't worry, Mr. Pei I'm fine Next time, in this situation Don't take matters into your own hands Call the police Wait for them to arrive The thief will be long gone You Okay, okay Don't say anything She's just looking out for me She said she's fine As long as she's fine Let me tell you You're the first girl Jing Shen brought back The first girl he brought back Grandma, I'm the one you brought back It's the same Right? Yeah What time is it? Still not ready? My son is hungry He's already eaten bread I told you Four dishes and a soup for each meal You only made two dishes Are you trying to make me angry? You only gave me 15 yuan What else can I make? These two dishes cost more than 15 yuan Let me tell you The budget for each meal is 15 yuan If it's not enough, you can't make it I can make four dishes and a soup for 15 yuan And balance meat and vegetables Who can do that? I've told you many times My son doesn't eat onions, ginger, or garlic Why did you put them in? Why is this so hard to eat? If it's not good, don't eat it How can you talk to my son like that? Are you trying to rebel? Mom, I'm pregnant. I can't do so much work. So what if you're pregnant? Being pregnant doesn't mean you're so precious. Who doesn't do everything while pregnant? When I was pregnant with my children, I did everything. What's wrong? Are you more precious than I am? What are our family rules? How many have you followed? If you want to comfortably be our family's daughter-in-law, it's not that easy. Wen Huaihui blames you for everything. Zhan An, can we move out? Your mom makes me do so much work every day. I really can't take it anymore. Move out? We don't have money right now. You should hurry and get a gynecological exam. Once your results are out, my mom can give me money. I thought about having a baby after marriage, but it's the same. But here I am, still not pregnant. She's your mom. Can't she just give you the money directly? My mom said she has to see a grandchild to give money. What can I do about it? If you hadn't borrowed money at high interest, I wouldn't have to suffer here. Is this about high-interest loans? If it weren't for you, you wouldn't have made me invest in that Tianliang Group, losing all the money. Could it be like it is now? Wasn't it to help you make money? It's all Wen Huaihui's fault. Don't mention her name in front of me again. Don't you want to find a way to get back what you lost? Manager Pei, you raised my salary. Yeah, right. It's three times higher. Yeah. I can't accept this. Then maybe thank you, Manager Pei. You must not regret it! Oh, right. Is your commute to work convenient? It's pretty good, quite convenient. That's good. I just wanted to say, if it's not convenient for you, I can arrange an apartment near the company for you. To live in. Why are you suddenly so nice to me? It's not because you want to use my organs for a match, is it? That's how they do it on TV. What's wrong? You don't have to be so polite. Don't even think about taking my kidneys. I won't give in. What kidneys? Are you trying to bombard me with sugar-coated shells and then take my kidneys? What are you thinking about? President Pei, there's a document that needs your signature. Get out. Okay, President Pei. President Pei, what is this? Wen Huihui. I like you, U. From the first time I saw you, I was unconsciously drawn to you. President Pei, stop joking around. I'm serious. Why? You're the president. What kind of woman do you want? You can have anyone. Besides, you have a fiancee. Why bother with me? Fiancee? I don't have a fiancee. No matter what you say, I don't want to be anyone's lover. Or accessory. I just want to love myself well. Wen Huihui. I just want to seriously date you. I want to be your boyfriend. In front of me, you've never been an accessory. I respect all your choices. I just hope that you can consider me without prejudice. You really want to be my boyfriend? Mhm. I need to think it over. I'll give you time. I'll wait for you. Is that why you gave me a raise? In your eyes, am I really someone who can't separate work and personal life? No. Then do you doubt your own abilities? Isn't that right? You work so hard, you deserve all of this. President Pei, no matter whether you become my boyfriend or not, you're still a great boss. I still want to be your boyfriend more. It's really kind of exciting. It's really makes my heart race. My leg is injured. I can't walk. I'm waiting for you to come back and save me. You take care and definitely wait for me to come back. General Manager Ma from Tengfei Technology is almost here. Got it. Get ready to receive him. Tengfei Technology Sounds familiar Yes, President Pei I remember now Tengfei Technology Isn't that the game company whose market value skyrocketed a year later? Yes, it is This necklace looks familiar Are you going to discuss cooperation with Tengfei? President Ma should be a good partner A good partner Why do you have this necklace? I've been wearing it since I was a kid That little girl back then Turns out it was her So she saved me twice President Ma is still waiting for you to start the meeting Yes President Pei, this Tengfei Technology Looks reliable You can trust me, I won't be wrong This cooperation will definitely Make a 100% profit What's wrong? Your necklace You mean this? How did you get this necklace? I didn't tell you When I was a kid, I was actually kidnapped Kidnapped This was given to me by the boy who was kidnapped with me He told me when he left That he would come back to save me But I didn't wait for him Later, it was Shi Zhanan who saved me So So You said earlier that Shi Zhanan saved you It was this incident It seems that we can't judge a person based on one thing Can't judge a person Do you still remember that boy? Of course, I remember We were locked up together During that time We gave each other strength So I've been wearing this Wait a minute He's not jealous, is he? Actually I'm just comrades-in-arms with him Fighting side by side Why do you keep asking about this necklace? Huihui I have something to tell you How did you get this? Actually, I'm that boy After I got back home I fainted Before I fainted, I told someone to save you They said that after they saved you They separated from you to distract the human traffickers And then we lost each other So it was you who told someone to save me Not Shi Zhanan Yes When they went to look for you again They couldn't find you Later I've been looking for you for many years. So he's been lying to me all along. It turns out you're the one who saved me. I never thought it would be you. I'm even more surprised. To be attracted to you again. When I found out. You had a boyfriend. I was really hurt. Later, I discovered he was cheating. I didn't know whether to be angry. Or happy. So you're angry because. I didn't break up with him. Yes. You just told me we're comrades. I didn't know it was you back then. So your feelings for me aren't just comradely. I don't know when it started. Every time I see you. I get nervous for no reason. I never thought. The person who saved me would be you. But now I'm certain. I like you. I'm willing to be your girlfriend. This can only be done in private. Not in the company. Why? People in the company. Love to gossip. They also know. I had a fight with Shi Zhan'an. At the entrance. If he finds out. We're together. I don't know what he'll say. Okay. I'll listen to you. I was thinking. Of discussing office romances. Aren't we having an office romance now? In the office? Let's go. Where? On a date. Wen Huihui is your niece, right? What niece? I don't have a niece. Don't try to swindle me. She's recently hooked up with. The president of the Pei Group. Living the good life. As her aunt. Shouldn't you try to reconnect with her? This girl is so powerful. I finally found you. This neighborhood is so nice. The houses are so big. So beautiful. How did you get here? I've been looking for you for a long time. I've missed you so much. Didn't you abandon me. On the side of the road? I called out to you so many times. You didn't look back. You misunderstood me. I had my reasons, dear. What do you want to talk about? Aunt, I've been a bit short on cash lately. Can you lend me some money? I knew it. You wouldn't have come to me otherwise. I'm just a working person. What money do I have? I heard you're not dating a rich boyfriend. Who told you that? Huihui. No matter what, we're still family. Just give me a little from what you have. Don't worry about whether I have money or not. Even if I had money, why should I give it to you? Your parents died young. If it weren't for me feeding you a bowl of porridge you would have starved to death long ago. You're so ungrateful. Trying to guilt-trip me, huh? I haven't fallen for that for a long time. Huihui, I'm not asking for much. I just want 500,000. Otherwise, tonight I won't leave here. What are you going to do? What do you mean by that? You little cutie. You ungrateful thing. Hey, come over here! Do you know Wen Huihui? This heartless person doesn't care about her own aunt. Do you guys know her? Oh, it makes me so angry. What are you doing here? If you don't give me money, I'm here to ask your man for it. This is a company, not a place for your nonsense. If you don't leave, I'll call the police. Not leaving, huh? I'm calling the police. What's going on? Are you Mr. Pei? I'm Huihui's aunt. You're the aunt who abandoned her as a child. I raised Huihui since she was little. I might not have done much, but I certainly put in my effort. And what happened? She completely ignores me, not even giving me living expenses. Right now, I can't even make ends meet. What do you want? She won't give me money. As her man, you should at least provide for me. I'm sorry, Mr. Pei. Sorry for the trouble. I'm taking her away now. Oh! This is outrageous. Look at this! The niece is hitting her aunt! What kind of person is causing a scene at the Pei family entrance? You're the new assistant, right? How did you handle this? It's a total mess. The security took them away. Isn't this the daughter of the Yao family? Yao Baixue, right? Jing Shen. Why didn't you come pick me up? How did you get here? I missed you, of course. I came back specifically. Let me introduce myself. I'm Jing Shen's fiancee. You're Assistant Wen, right? Hello, Miss Yao. I have things to do, I'll leave now. Yao Baixue, don't talk nonsense here. Are you spreading rumors that you're with Jing Shen? Miss Yao, which eye saw me spreading rumors? Otherwise your aunt wouldn't have made a scene at the company. Even if Assistant Wen said something like that, I wouldn't mind at all. How can you think that way? Jing Shen is with you just for the money. Otherwise, why would she make a scene at the company? Miss Yao is not wrong. I'm with President Pei for the money. Look, she's with you just for money. In today's world, who isn't doing it for the money? I'm working for President Pei. The money I earn is my rightful salary. Right, President Pei? Right. Grandma, what are you doing here? Long time no see. I've missed you. I thought since Jing Shen was here, it would be nice to gather. I just ran into the family matter of Assistant Wen. It has made its way to the company. Huihui, are you okay? I'm fine. How dare you call me Grandma? Xiaoxue, I asked her to call me that. Grandma, you don't know, she doesn't even care about her own aunt, all for the sake of money, being with Jing Shen. Grandma, don't listen to her nonsense. I'll explain later. Huihui, Grandma believes in you. If you encounter any difficulties in the future you must tell Grandma. Okay, Grandma. Grandma. I haven't come back for a while, right? I was thinking of having a meal with Jing Shen. Jing Shen and Xiao Hui. They're both very busy. Let's not disturb them. Look at what I'm wearing today, it's all for you. But... No buts! You look down on me, old lady, right? No, not at all. As long as there's none, let's go. You're not angry, right? Angry about what? Why does Grandma treat me so well? She wouldn't know that we are together, right? Dating me is such a shameful thing. I just am not used to being watched by too many people dating. Alright. If we don't talk about it, we won't. Then what's the deal with Yao Bai Xue? And what about the arranged marriage? Are you jealous? Of course not. You're finally jealous for me. So what's the deal? Our families are family friends. We were set to play together when we were kids. After I grew up and understood, I immediately called off the engagement. But she always took it seriously, always considered herself my fiancee. Then why did you call off the engagement? Isn't she pretty? She's really outstanding too. Because I don't like her. No matter how beautiful or excellent she is, I'm not interested in her. And I met you. In my eyes, you are the most outstanding. The most beautiful one. I only like you. Okay, I trust you. I only like you too. Mr. Pei, you told me last time I have something to attend to, so I'll leave. You'd better have something important. Alright then. It's just last weekend. You said you wanted to buy a gift for Assistant Wen. Did you get it? That necklace. It's their exclusive custom. It won't arrive until next week. Such a beautiful necklace. I knew it. Jing Shen remembers my birthday. We'll go shopping together. I... I don't have time. I still have to work. Even if I don't work, I'm not obligated to go shopping with you. You're not my fiancee. I broke off the engagement long ago. I don't want to hear you say that. Then don't go with me. I'll go shopping by myself. Remember to buy me a birthday gift. I don't believe you don't have me in your heart. Where did you get that necklace? Sorry, Miss Yao, I'm afraid I'm not obligated to tell you that. Did you get it from Jing Shen? I don't understand what you're saying. I have things to do, I need to go. Didn't I tell you? Don't just show up at my company? Where's my birthday gift? Your birthday? Go ask Assistant Chen to take you shopping. You forgot my birthday? What about that necklace? Necklace? That wasn't for you. You gave it to Wen Huihui, didn't you? That's none of your business. If you want to buy something, go ask Assistant Chen. If not, then just leave. That bad person Wen Huihui, won't let you take Jing Shen. The old lady has arrived. Hello, madam. Are you here to find your granddaughter? Do you need me to help you find her? President Pei is in the lounge. Huihui, why haven't you come home for dinner recently? Grandma, I've been a bit busy lately. You need to take care of your health even if you're busy. Go find Jing Shen. What's going on? Could it be that Wen Huihui is the old lady's granddaughter? No wonder President Pei treats her so well. I have to tell everyone about this. Grandma, what are you doing here? I came to help you out. If I didn't come, I wouldn't know how long you would drag this out. You like that girl, you should say it. You don't dare to say it? Aren't you afraid she'll be chased away? Grandma is just going to say it directly. Actually, we're already together. I'm sorry, Grandma. That's great. We didn't tell you. Alright, alright. It's good that you're together. We didn't say anything. It's worried about the negative impact on the company. What negative impact could there be? Who would dare to have an opinion? Grandma. I respect Huihui. She can decide when to go public. As long as you all are happy. I see you really like this. I've bought you some more. Eat more. Huihui must be thirsty. Come have a cup of coffee. I made it for you myself. What's going on, why so strange all of a sudden? Why are you causing trouble in my company? What do you want to do? I don't want to do anything. I just want money. Who sent you? No one sent me. I just want money. Who? It's a woman with the surname Xu. She called me. Don't harass Huihui anymore. It's you again, Xu Qinglu. You are my best friend. Spending so much money on treatment. It would be better to end the pain sooner. Use your life. To exchange for my happiness with Zhan'an. You can't even have children. So what if it's your money? Just wash the clothes first. Come over and sweep the floor first. Since you all are holding onto me. Don't blame me for being rude. Mr. Pei, you were looking for me. This project is assigned to you. Shi Zhan'an wants to redevelop, right? Then just as you wish. Look, our house is about to be redeveloped. That's great, it's finally happening. You're lucky. You don't have to do anything. You can just be rich. Let's see who will dare to bully me later. Once I get this money. I'll make those loan sharks. Kneel down and beg for mercy. Grandma, have some tea. Xiaoxue. I know you like Jingshen. But Jingshen only has Huihui in his heart. The two of them are together every day. You... Don't keep it in your heart anymore. Let it go. Grandma. Even you are on her side. Jingshen likes Huihui. What should I do about this? I've known him since we were young. We grew up together. Why can't we be together? Oh, Xiaoxue. Love is something that... Doesn't have a sequence. Er Qie Hui Hui helped a lot in Jing Shen's work. She was also very helpful. Isn't it just about making some money? Does she deserve to compete with me for Jing Shen? Good morning, Miss Yao. Where is Wen Hui Hui? Are you looking for Hui Hui? Then you must have a good relationship with Hui Hui. She's not worthy. Isn't she the president's sister? Who told you that? Everyone says so. They say she's the daughter of the Pei family. That's why President Pei and the old lady treat her so well. Don't listen to their nonsense. Help me with something. What is it? Check it out. What work are Wen Hui Hui and Jing Shen discussing? I know about this. I heard they're going to sign a contract with Xiao Mai Technology's President Lei. Help me with something. What are you doing? What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Go back home. Let's continue drinking. Stinky woman. Can you go back? Let's have a drink together. I'll take this opportunity to say I had a miscarriage. My child. Child. What miscarriage? You're useless. You can't even keep a child. Mom, it was Zhan An who pushed me. And I was too tired. What were you doing that made you so tired? You can't even live properly. You still have the nerve to say you're tired. My son shouldn't have married you. Don't think I don't know. You married into our family. What do you mean? You just wanted our family's money. Don't think you can be a young mistress. Wen Hui Hui, it's all your fault. We're going to sign a contract with Xiao Mai Technology this afternoon. But now the internet is full of negative news about them. They say they're about to go bankrupt. Have you seen the news? Xiao Mai Technology's stock has plummeted. How did Wen Hui Hui find this partnership? How did you know? We're going to sign a contract with Xiao Mai. I just happened to overhear. Wen Hui Hui. Is she having an affair with President Lei? Go back home and stop talking nonsense. Stop spreading rumors. Isn't the signing ceremony this afternoon? I want to see what happens. Wen Huahui How do we clean up this mess? Pleasure to cooperate. Next is the reporters. Time for open questions. Right now, Little Wheat Technology is under fire. May I ask why you insist on signing a contract with them? Aren't you afraid of tarnishing the Pei family's reputation? It's said your assistant was the one who insisted on this cooperation. Are you trying to win a smile from a beauty at the expense of countless investors? Is that a joke? Mr. Pei, please give everyone a reasonable explanation. Everyone, today aside from the signing ceremony, we also have an important announcement. Little Wheat Technology has successfully developed a luxury electric car. Let's wait and see. Little Wheat Technology's stock price is rising. Mr. Pei, you've been working hard lately, right? What do you want? That demolition project you gave me last time for Jian'an Village, I've made a little adjustment. You adjust it then. Adjust it however you like. Son, son. Look, the demolition notice has come. How could this happen? Why is it being demolished around our house? Huh? Why aren't they demolishing our house? They're even building a crematorium nearby? Not only are they not demolishing it, but they also want to build a crematorium? If they don't demolish it, we won't get any demolition compensation. What will happen to my debts? This is outrageous! Why won't they demolish our house? What kind of sin is this? It's a decision made by Pei. Wen Huahui. It must be Wen Huahui's scheme. Disgusting. I must find that disgusting ** to settle the score. Do you want to teach Wen Huahui a lesson? Kill Wen Huahui. I'll give you 20 million. Yes, 20 million. Killing is a big deal. What if we get caught? No problem. I can arrange all of this. Why should we trust you? 50 million. But killing... Deal. What should we do? Why did you let me know about this kind of thing? The world of the wealthy is so chaotic and hard to understand. Now the demolition money is gone. You can't even get money from your mom. Yao Baixue's proposal is the best solution. Xu Qinglu. You're really ruthless. Don't just say that about me. Aren't you the same? Anyway, we both hate Wen Huihui. This is a win-win situation. But how are we going to kill her? We've never killed anyone before. I just thought of someone. Oh, you. Since you got married. I haven't seen you visit me. You're not. Going to find a rich husband? How come you never brought any money back? Let your dad spend it. Do you want money or not? What, you really want to give me money? Help me with something. After it's done. I can help you pay off your debt. What is it? Help me kill someone. Who is it? You're so noisy in the morning. Can't you let people sleep? Isn't this Wen Huihui's aunt? What are you doing here? Stop arguing. This is my daughter. Wow, your daughter is so grown up. Auntie, we finally meet. Do you still remember me? Damn it. Jing Shen, you're bleeding. It's nothing. Are you okay, Pei? Wen Assistant. It's nothing. Find out for me. It's Pei. How did you get here? I was going to your place to find you. But your phone's security system. Showed that you were here. I thought it was strange. So I followed you. Luckily, I arrived on time. Useless, can't even do this right. Can't find these two people. We're all doomed. Do you still remember me? I called you before. About Wen Huihui's matter. Oh, it's you. You went to find her. You must have benefited a lot. That ungrateful girl. Has money now and doesn't think of me. Hmph. She's that kind of person. Very selfish. She hurt me badly. But I didn't think she'd be so heartless. Even to her own aunt. Without any regard. It's that little bitch. I shouldn't have kept her back then. Her parents are dead. I should have strangled her back then. It's useless to keep her alive anyway. It's not too late now. You guys kill her together. I'll give you a large sum of money. Not only can you pay off your debt, but also send you abroad to retire. Is it true? Retire abroad? It's up to you whether you do it or not. What's the big deal? She doesn't treat me like her own aunt anyway. Hum! Leave it to me. Wen Huihui. I'll make your only relative kill you with their own hands. What are you going to do? Boss Pei. We couldn't find the person who hit you. Wen's assistant's aunt has also disappeared. All the clues suddenly disappeared. I just want to take everything away from you. Do it, Zhan An. She's lived long enough. I'll help you take good care of Zhan An's. It must be them. Shi Zhan An and Xu Qinglu. Why did you still not let me go after I was reborn? You go out first. Jing Shen. What's wrong? It must be Shi Zhan An and Xu Qinglu. They told my aunt about my situation. No, we can't just sit and wait. Don't worry, I'll help you. I won't let anyone hurt you. It's all your fault. You said your dad could kill someone. Now the task has failed. What do you say we do? How do I know? My dad and Wen Huihui's aunt can't be contacted at all. I don't know where they're hiding. I shouldn't have trusted you. You blame me? If it wasn't for your family, the demolition fee would be gone. I wouldn't have agreed to kill someone. You still dare to say that? If you hadn't had a miscarriage, and still hadn't gotten pregnant, I would have gotten the money by now. Would we still need to kill someone? Fine, Shi Zhan An. You're blaming me for not being able to get pregnant? Maybe it's because you're not capable of making someone pregnant. What did you say? I think you should go to the hospital to get checked out. Maybe it's just you who's not up to par. Who are you saying is not up to par? So many women are fighting to be with me. You're saying I'm not up to par? What kind of women? The hostesses at the KTV? They're just in it for the money. They'll say anything for money. Let me go. I advise you to speak nicely. Watch your tone. When are you going to pay me back? I heard your family's house is going to be demolished. Soon, soon. I'll be able to pay you back soon. Just wait a little longer, okay? The interest from before... won't last much longer. Ms. Yao. When can you... get things done? I'll find an opportunity next time. If we drag this on... you can forget about the money. It didn't work out this time. Next time... who knows when that'll be. Huihui. Thanks for agreeing to meet me. What do you want to talk about? I want to apologize to you. I've been through so much... and I've come to realize... I really don't have the face to see you. But I'm really... at the end of my rope. You want to ask me for money? Yes. I really hope... you can help me out again. Give me another chance... to start over. I'll pay you back slowly... just give me some time. I'll think about it. You still have the nerve to come to me? After that thing didn't work out... what do you plan to do? We ran into some trouble. What kind of tricks are you playing? I really don't know who sent it... but I do know... we're in this together now. We're on the same rope. When will you take care of Wen Huihui? That little cutie... dared to fight me for Jing Shen. If I don't kill her, I won't be satisfied. Why do you all like her so much? Is there something I'm not good enough at? I'm the Yao family's daughter... and I've never been with a rich man before. If I were with the Yao family's daughter... who knows how many people would be jealous? Maybe the Yao family will be mine someday. Of course, Ms. Yao is the best. Ms. Yao is the best, after all. Wen Huihui can't compare to you. I'll transfer you 1 million. Wen Huihui's aunt's matter. Has been resolved. I'll transfer you another 10 million. Our people have been monitoring. Shizhan An's account. We've discovered his account. Suddenly has an extra 1 million. Looked into it. We found out the source of the funds. It's actually Miss Yao. I didn't expect her to deal with me. By cooperating with Shizhan An. Someone like him. Huihui. Don't worry. I will definitely seek justice for you. Don't act rashly for now. I want to handle it myself. Hmm. As long as you need me, I'll be here. Here's a card. Inside is something for you to start over. Huihui, thank you. I never thought you could forgive me. And this. Remember the year of your birthday? You liked it but couldn't afford it. I'm giving it to you now as a keepsake. Huihui, do you remember? I'll take my leave now. Yao Baixue. Find a way to let Xu Qinglu see this video. Don't expose your identity. Understood, President Pei. You actually want to divorce me for her. Then we'll have no ties at all. You don't think I'm looking for you, after what happened, my dad went missing. Don't you want to know where he is? Could it be that you don't even have 1 billion? Then just wait to trend. I want to see 1 billion within three days. You dare to scheme with Xu Qinglu against me? What are you talking about? Stop pretending with me. She said she has evidence of me hiring someone to harm. She demands 1 billion from me. Otherwise, she'll expose me. I really don't know. If I knew, why would I be looking for you? She only gave me three days. What do you plan to do? Xu Qinglu is such a cutie. She's really gone crazy. Do you remember this? I saved you here. Huihui. It's great to have you. What's the matter? Is something wrong? Assistant Chen found your aunt. She has already been taken to the police station. Hmm Once I kill Xu Qinglu, you won't have any threats. After all, she's your wife. Can you do it? I already have you. Why do I need her? What do you want to do? Accidental death contract. You're really smart. You solve the person, and get the money. It's really a win-win situation. Once she's dead, the 1 billion insurance payout will be received. Who is it? Who is this? What are you doing here? You can't come in if it's not you. Following you was indeed the right choice. I've caught you, right? Yao Baixue. You shameless woman. Who are you cursing? You actually pushed me for her. I married you. I haven't had a good day ever since. I've been taking care of your mom at home. The relocation that was promised was never done. Do you have any conscience? Shi Zhangan. You really thought of killing me, for insurance money. Bastard. Quickly deal with her. And also with Wen Huahui's matter. Got it. Help! Stop shouting. No one is here. Even if you scream at the top of your lungs, no one will come to save you. Shi Zhangan, you heartless one. I should never have married you. You forgot? You were the one who was pregnant with my child and insisted on marrying me. When I asked you for a divorce, you should have divorced me obediently and this wouldn't have happened now. Since you didn't listen to advice, don't force me to take action. You really think you're something special. If it wasn't to take revenge on Wen Huahui, I wouldn't have looked at you at all. No money, no ability, only whining and relying on others. What did you say? You don't really think I'm pregnant, do you? Let me tell you, I've never been pregnant. You don't realize you can't do it? Where does your confidence come from? You're not pregnant. Right. I was lying to you. Sweetheart, I'll make you shut up now. Huihui, how could you be so surprised? I learned self-defense just for you. What right do you have? What right do you have to be better than me since we were kids? Why do you get all the attention? You're just an orphan, you have nothing. Why does everyone only see you? Because I've been working hard while you've been complaining. So you deliberately set me up to seduce Shizhan An. Let me bear what's supposed to be yours. Isn't this what you wanted? Didn't you want this? Weren't you the one who started it? He's lucky to have me, his ancestors must have done something right. His family bullied me and tortured me. You always like to shift the blame onto others. Have you ever thought that this is all your fault? You deserve it. It's your fault. It's all your fault, go to hell! The police are here. It's all over. Get me a car. Book the earliest flight out of Haishi. Is this Yao Baixue? Do you know this person? Come with us. Hello, this is my ID. How is he doing? If he doesn't wake up, he might be a vegetable for the rest of his life. The suspect is in custody. We'll keep an eye on him. We'll send someone to monitor him. Oh, my son... Why is your life so hard? You ran into that bad person and now you're like this. Son... Who are you? This is my son. I need to tell you something. Grandma, what are you doing here? I heard you and Jing Shen had a fight. It must be Jing Shen's fault. I'll teach him a lesson. Don't bother with him. No, Grandma, Jing Shen is nice. It's my fault. What's nice about him? If he's nice, why did you reject his proposal? Why don't you want to marry Jing Shen? You finally got together... You need to know, Jing Shen how much he loves you. It's me who doesn't want to get married. Do you think that marriage is too soon? We can at least book the wedding, you see. Grandma, I have to go. I'm leaving now. Take your time. Hui Hui. What's going on with you two? She probably doesn't like me that much. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer in my past life, it was already late stage. Am I going to relive this in this life? I absolutely cannot drag Jing Shen down. I must not. Doctor, just tell me. I can handle it. You're perfectly fine. You have no issues whatsoever. Your body is very healthy. Are you sure? Absolutely sure. The test results show that your body is just very healthy. But why do I always feel some pain in my chest? Is it because my period is coming? But I've been feeling like this for the past two to three months. That's quite normal. But you young people, should take care of yourselves. You shouldn't work yourself to death. I really don't have breast cancer. No breast cancer at all. It's likely due to long-term negative emotions, like anger, depression, and anxiety. How about you? Are you doing well? And the test results? No problems at all. So don't worry. It seems that in my last life having cancer was caused by An's family and Xu Qinglu's anger. Now that they can't anger me, my body has become healthy. What's wrong? Are you hiding something from me? Is there something going on? Nothing, there's nothing at all. Then why did you come to the hospital? Why have you been acting so strangely lately? If there's anything, just tell me. Are you sick? Really, I'm fine. It's just that I thought I was sick before, so I came for a check-up. But you see, there's nothing at all. That's great! You've been deliberately distancing yourself from me lately. Is it because... Did you think you were sick? You can't do this in the future. Yes, President Pei. Good morning, President Wen. This is our latest weekly report. I'll put it in your office later. Please take a look. Okay. I used to always be on the wrong side. This time, I finally got it right. Yay! In my past life, I didn't love myself properly. Heaven gave me a chance to start over. Letting me live for myself. This is probably the meaning of life. Mom, Mom! Don't rush this moment. Spend time with your husband and the kids. I'm coming! May you all encounter what your heart desires and have a fulfilling life.
