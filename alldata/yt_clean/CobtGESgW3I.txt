hello and welcome in a previous video about installing Windows 3.1 on a new Modern Hardware I promised to film another video where I will try to install Windows 1.0 and windows 2.0 on this PC so today we'll do it let's go we have the same PCS before it's Intel 9900k 32 gigabytes of RAM MSI z390 Motherboard and 2K Ultra monitor with 144hz rate as you remember in the previous video about Windows 3.1 we succeed with the installation so it's logical to assume we can succeed with Windows 1.0 and 2.02 right let's try Windows 1.0 release date is December 9 1987. it was almost 38 years ago Windows 1.0 and 2.0 as Windows 3.1 setup must be running from MS-DOS I know it's better to use OG version of MS-DOS to avoid any issues but I will try to use 3dos first which can be written to use bistic using a program called Rufus it takes two minutes done let's start Windows 1.0 installation first we need to download Windows image and zip it and copy files to USB stick and don't forget to integrate XM jar driver or we can get a memory error as it was in the previous videos okay let's try to boot press nf11 to access boot menu on MSI Motherboard select a USB stick redose is loaded start in Windows 1.0 installation is pretty simple too you just need to type setup.x and press enter Great Windows 1.0 setup begins as you can see the menu has a black background not blue as we used to see press C to continue choosing setup on a hard disk C to continue type the full path name Windows 1 o point in device I'll let it be Microsoft mouse choose your graphics adapter Let It Be One IBM printer now to start Windows 1.0 all you need is to type win and press enter and the flickering screen appears okay what about Windows 2.0 it will crash too let's find out turnstile Windows 2.0 you will need to do the same actions download the image unzip it and copy to USB stick xmgr driver was already integrated done booting from USB as you can see the menu differs from Windows 1.0 setup next choose in Windows directory choose your PC of course this list doesn't have modern motherboards you may notice HP Vector here one of these you could see in one of my videos can Windows 11 run on Pentium tool PC 1998 Let It Be IBM for example next it determines VGA keyboard and mouse no change choose e if you have more than 64 kilobytes of memory we have 32 gigabytes so I choose e printer no Countryside settings modify no start man test skip setup has now completed successfully let's try to boot but the same flicker on screen appears no problem I have another PC called craftway it's an old PC from 2008 with Pentium D inside let's try to run Windows 1.0 and 2.0 on it but when I try to run Windows something went wrong first this then these this and this it was Windows 1.0 vs OD by the way have you ever seen it before it looks scary so what's the problem the problem is I was using freedos not an OG version of MS-DOS on one of Windows bsods you may notice a message incorrect MS-DOS version it means all my actions from the beginning were wrong in one of my previous videos I've already installed MS-DOS on this PC so I will do it again if you haven't watched it yet a link will be in the description in the comments you corrected me that the latest official release of OMS dos is 6.22 but not 7.1 thank you for this amazda 6.22 was installed successfully by the way of course not without xmjr driver which was integrated in the image starting Windows 1.0 installation next next next and it failed again another flickering screen appears if I try to run Windows 2.0 we will have the same picture I think the main reason why it can be started is the wrong version of MS-DOS so I've tried to install a mess dos version 5.0 and it's stuck during installation then I tried other earlier versions and they want boot too so this is end of course not I have a second PC with Intel i7 3770k on LJ 1155 socket let's try to put Windows on it and that's what happens gray screen and it doesn't depend on MS-DOS version what about Windows 2.0 it failed too but if you're using MS-DOS 6.22 version what if we try to use MS-DOS 7.1 version and what we succeed nice my keyboard and my mouse are working well all because the bias is emulating them okay let's check system properties using a program called MSD processor a noun bias date 2014 disk drivers it shows only 300 megabytes but we have 6 terabytes hard disk com ports device drivers okay go to Windows 2.0 let's open calculator it's the same as in Windows 3.1 but it doesn't have scientific mode calendar we still have some artifacts as it was on Windows 3.1 and windows 88 videos card file clipboard clock it doesn't have a digital mode yet command incorrect dos version message appears all because we use MS-DOS 7.1 Version Control Panel Mouse settings country settings screen colors let it be blue looks nice notepad is still the same after 36 years paint let's draw my Channel logo again something like this nice reversy I still don't understand how to play this game terminal alright what about all games is it possible to run them here let's start blood not enough memory what about Doom it's stuck Duke nukem-1 another memory error Duke Nukem 3D it's working but we don't have a sound it's not surprising all because we don't have any sound drivers for newer Hardware on GTA 1 oh it's working too what a miracle yeah the graphics have improved for the last 3 decades let's try Commander Keen it's stuck too commanderkin 4 out of memory stuck maybe King dreams stuck again Prince of Persia another memory error Wolfenstein 3D stuck in the previous video about installing MS-DOS in the comment section you told me why these errors appeared I've tried several Solutions but nothing worked I'm sure these errors can be solved I think there are two reasons why we can't run Windows 1.0 in 2.0 on a modern PC the first reason is an incorrect version of MS-DOS for example to run Windows 1.0 properly you will need MS-DOS 3.3 version to run Windows 2.0 you will need them as thus 5.0 version I've tried to install all these versions on a modern PC with integrating XM jar driver but it failed if we can't install all MS-DOS version then we can't run Windows 1.0 in 2.0 also the secondary reason is an incompatible VGA driver that's why you may notice a flickering screen looks like Windows 3.1 have a more compatible VGA driver than Windows 1.0 and 2.0 but somehow Windows 2.0 can run on Intel i7 3770k which is amazing that's all in the next video we'll try to install Windows 7 on a modern PC if you want to see more videos about Windows installation on a Modern Hardware you can check the wall playlist also I have a second Channel where I post Windows tutorials all the links will be in the description thanks for
