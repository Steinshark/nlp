Good morning, everybody, and welcome back TV show that always forgets to shuffle the Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories is the franchise, reconverting GBA Chain from 2D Clever use of the card-based battle system be well aware, I am incapable of speaking Can You Beat Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories There's only a single rule: with a fresh save mechanic becomes available, the player must whose total size is at most 1. That's it! If the number of cards in your equipped deck anything you want. With the rule set, let's get this run started! Just to make absolutely sure nobody gets any normally. That's why the one rule specifies that the which is immediately after entering the first Once you have access, go ahead and make any Except that one. You're terrible at this. Turns out, there's a secret second rule implemented if it contains at least one Attack card. Our starting inventory limits that one card cards, but every world you progress to will The only stat that really matters between the base damage of basic attacks. Whenever you get a stronger Keyblade card, 0 variant and a relatively high value variant. Without going into too much detail, higher stunning the prior card's user. 0 is a special exception, automatically countering For basic Heartless, equip a high value variant Trust me, there's gonna be a lot of grind. With only a single card, our DPS is ludicrously We only get the one attack from our one card charging the Reload Card. Incredibly thankfully, Donald and Goofy are Just because we're playing with a 1 Card Deck Friend cards representing your current party time an attack hits an enemy. Donald will cast two random spells, and Goofy Goofy is almost always preferable, usually And if you're wondering what Pluto does, he Beating random Heartless battles will give and, you're not gonna believe this, experience If you aren't a bad person you might remember bonuses to choose from: a max health increase, attack. Card points allow us to put more cards in cards from our deck for special attacks, and Take three guesses which one I recommend. Those health increases will be incredibly boss fights. Since bosses all have pretty long health bars, long time, and during that period you absolutely Without the ability to equip healing cards, or a Pluto card, and let me tell you, if you want to see Pluto's heal rate. It's best just to assume that every time you You'll need to memorize every single boss' Against the first boss, Guard Armor, focus They have an attack that will chase after being both dangerous and an annoying time Once it's down to just its body and head, Hug close to a wall while rolling; Guard Armor giving you more room to breath. The rest should be easy. Immediately after in the Floor 1 exit is Axel. This essentially functions as a tutorial for shown in the bottom-right corner of the screen, multi-card sleights. When facing any bosses who can use sleights, These attacks are usually too dangerous to Countering before the attack is executed is For that reason, you must absolutely never card is out of reach. Before actually attacking, pre-emptively charge still technically not being fully filled. Once done, that's your cue to attack, after card at-the-ready. Axel only has a single straight-forward standard he'll be easy. The next few worlds are mostly a breeze, until hardest boss fights in the entire franchise: Friggin'. Soldiers. I'm serious! These guys are absolutely unrelenting death money. In a normal playthrough you wouldn't notice everybody's dead. But if you give them any downtime, which we go on the offensive. The Spade cards carry an axe, and this axe They charge at Sora, swinging the axe over you to dodge roll over and over and over and not stopping? And the moment the attack ends, they're just You have zero time to breath! I was genuinely questioning whether this run towel because of this stupid joke filler miniboss. Your only hope of survival is to counter. Inbetween every dodge, you have a very very reload just slightly. Get into a perfect rhythm and be extremely For whatever reason, when Sora successfully moving for a fraction of a second. This will screw you over if performed at any Whenever a friend card drops, go ahead and They'll give you a huge amount of progress. Once the first wave of Spade cards are gone, Thankfully they're an entirely different breed Heart cards have a single jabbing spear attack The attack lasts too long for dodge rolling range, and even then, be careful: the soldiers extending the range of the spear attack. Most of the time you should hop over the attack, time to reload. Play a lengthy game of keep-away while getting you'll take out both Hearts and enter the 2 Spade soldiers simul-friggin-taneously. As you can probably imagine, this is ludicrously on their own, but when either type could potentially an incredibly unfunny joke. That's why you should save any Donald or Goofy Let 'em loose and aim specifically for the With them gone there will only be one suit strategy as before. If you can keep consistent enough, and get battle is indeed somehow possible. Our next point of interest is hell. Monstro features the boss fight against Parasite immediately damages Sora on contact. Just to make this as frustrating as possible, the acid if Sora stands on them too long. And to make things even more frustrating than has both a giant poison ball ranged attack likely to be hit by them immediately after Donald and Goofy aren't gonna be that helpful, frustrating detail of this game's design. While a Friend card is in play, for some unfathomable Meaning, if you use a Friend card here, you To safely get damage in, all of your attacks Parasite Cage and giving time to escape. When a Gimmick card spawns, you can use it enough time to safely summon a Friend. With some very cautious and precise play, on into hell! What, did you think that was it? Parasite Cage is only the hell midboss, the To complete this minigame, we need to fill of the screen by defeating tons of Heartless As you can probably imagine, the only valid card drops. To maximize drop chances, aim your keyblade swing. Each individual hit is one more roll of the Also make sure to grab those Friend cards time, so any hits dealt during such time are When you're approaching the 30 second mark, for the best. Even if this run got good drop luck, they the game wanted them to, failing to fill the And as I found out absolutely crushingly after do not apply. If you fill the bar slightly after the timer but then the screen just fades out like it This will be a terribly boring and frustrating you, eventually, you will appease the apparent Those hours won't be completely wasted, though: Game Over. That means all the EXP you obtain in each by the time you beat it you'll have a massive The final world of the first set, Halloween the easiest boss in the entire game, Oogie His attacks are so infrequent and difficult because your bathroom break took too long. After that very very very short break, get we're heading into yet another of the hardest Larxene has three standard attacks. In one attack, she'll throw out two sets of dodged by jumping above both volleys. In a second attack, she'll chase you down two dodge rolls. Making things tricky, the timing on these to be done late, while the second needs to And in her third attack, she hits you with If you're wondering how to dodge it, you clearly She hits you with friggin' lightning. It is technically possible not to get hit as far as I can tell it's entirely a matter Larxene is fully capable of hitting you if get hit by lightning. And since this is one of Larxene's standard we have no hope of actually countering her This battle is under a soft time limit. No matter how good you are at dodging, if And to make matters about fifty times worse, Phase 2, where her melee attacks are upgraded And the fifth hit is lightning! Don't even bother trying to fight her until its literal maximum. At first you'll want to actually win Heartless your map cards are near full, which they will room. Attack a Heartless in the overworld to enter it, grab the EXP that drops, and bid these beginning the battle once again. A Friend card is guaranteed to drop every ensures every attack will be a room-clearer. With your health bar far larger than any reasonable the most hellish grind you will ever participate Since her lightning is automatically draining you must dodge her kunai and melee attacks As for the lightning itself, just dodge roll I genuinely have no better advice. For any attempt to have a hope of being possible, you with the lightning on a semi-frequent cards, of sufficiently high value, to spawn The moment you reach Phase 2, unleash every starting with Donald since Donald is potentially I will warn you, however, that Donald... is With astronomically unfathomable RNG, you'll Donald will not stab you in the back, Larxene Donald or Goofy, and all those cards combined Larxene's health bar to 0. This singular battle delayed the video by And it's only the halfway point. In Atlantica we fight Ursula, who will be endurance battle. You can only hurt her when she's directly She'll come on her own after you kill a few to safely deal a single hit. If you try to hit her while countering attacks, More lucrative is when a Gimmick card drops, Thankfully, Ursula's own attacks are mostly perform them. Attack the tentacles from a safe distance about half an hour Ursula will finally go At the floor's exit, we'll fight Riku. His moveset is a little difficult to get the can be dodged by jumping every time he approaches, have more than enough health to make up for It was at this point that I finally realized, proper order is for dumb stupid idiots, moving Specifically because Hollow Bastion's signature highest physical attack power of all Attack We'll now be dealing the maximum possible strikes. It'll come in handy when fighting Hollow Bastion's While her attacks have massive range, the of following you to the edge, meaning you're and shockwaves. Hug the wall and make carefully timed approaches right to take La Vie en Rose with you to the In this floor's exit, we'll meet a familiar In addition to having a longer health bar, sleight, and his standard overhead jump attack It's honestly not really that much of an upgrade, just fine. The next two floors are Neverland and the other is a nightmare beyond comprehension, Worth noting, entering Neverland adds Glide While slow, it's particularly useful in extending After both is the boss battle against Vexen, I forgot to record it, and Vexen 2 is the In advance, we'll be doing a little prep. First, throw Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories in the 358/2 Days cutscene compilation. With exactly 0 cards in our deck, the Kingdom In fact, it's an ULTIMATE Mission Complete, skips, I managed to beat a bonus challenge, watching a single cutscene. With the franchise's canon play order thoroughly and finally open the Room to Rewards with obtained by now. Recognizing our popcorn munching prowess, attack card, featuring the highest possible Fire elemental damage. Most bosses are resistant to Fire damage, element. Use Twilight Town's new Moogle card packs floor's exit and jam into Vexen's face... You will be just as flabbergasted as me, and Everybody deserves to. See, turns out, when they were making this magic resistance stats across all the bosses, resistant to fire! Oh, but don't worry, they didn't forget everything, With an hour of your life thoroughly wasted, Vie en Rose and finally actually fight Vexen. The same general rules apply while dealing as far as you can get away with. It's worth noting Card Breaks are explicitly can only be attacked past with Card Breaks To dodge his ranged icicle attack, dodge roll within that general area as the icicle tries Be ready to run if Vexen approaches you, if a potential attack. The real danger will be Vexen's sleights, One has such a long startup that I genuinely is a quick trail of chasing ice pillars which Careful on the counter: the ice pillars' hitboxes it, you can still take damage by passing over This is a bit of an endurance battle since two bonus healthbars, but with proactive reloads, off with Donald and Goofy, you'll eventually Next up is a familiar familiar face: Riku We can no longer easily outlife him; this His charge attack is now upgraded with a projectile, Your number one priority should be preventing attack, which has a random stun chance locking combo. When dealing damage, as I hope you've gotten and always from the furthest distance you Just like with Larxene before, I couldn't my entire strategy on a roll of the friendship past Phase 2 right as my health went critical. &quot;Gosh Gamerchamp,&quot; every single human being section, &quot;Your dumb stupid clickbait title isn't using Donald and Goofy cheating?&quot; No worries, Sora's been thinking the same and Goofy he's had enough of their ****ing to tell Riku that Namine is a ****ing ***** *** *****ing frankly, silly. Welcome to Riku 4. All of Riku's attacks are in their strongest from the beginning of the battle, including ever been, Donald and Goofy are drowning themselves how to dodge his attacks, and the run is over. That's it, the end. Upon reaching Riku 4, I immediately realized beat this boss fight with only a single card, degree of sincerity would inevitably trigger the game off. So, as much as it pained me, I ultimately So anyway it's one week later I hate my life Since we have no reliable way of healing ourselves, Riku is in the same position, so logically, battle we need a dodging strategy that, on pecentage of damage over time than Riku does. Without Friend card DPS boosts, we're nowhere First off, we need a method that deals damage follow-up attack with 100% reliability. After many hours of experimentation, I realized That means attacking Riku's backside buys Riku ever conveniently stops on the spot for while he waits for the wave to dissipate. His card is still legally in play during this from the Card Break. By the way, always wait a short moment after If you reload while the Attack card is discarding yet, thus completely wasting the reload. Now that we can deal damage without taking taking damage. After many, many, many, many hours of experimentation, For most of the battle, Riku will run towards attack when he's within a certain distance. To reliably dodge either attack, give Riku with perfect timing as he breaches his attack Even if you get the timing, you're still not he uses and react accordingly. It's difficult to describe how to react, though, memory. Basically I try to wiggle around him in a sometimes a lot. He also may not even take the opportunity through his deck looking for a card he likes. You'll have to improvise a bit, but whatever Don't forget you have the ability to glide You'll also need to dodge his sleights. Keep an eye on Riku's currently stocked cards The specific sleight can be determined by If he stocks a card with a green background, If he stocks a card with a blue background, And if he stocks a red card, he's prepping Note that Riku is capable of cancelling his caught unawares. Helm Split is easily dodged in its entirety DPS as possible, you can instead dodge roll jumping and gliding over the third one. Dark Firaga you'll need to be particularly If you jump too high immediately prior, you'll and dodge. Finally, Dark Aura, thanks to its incredible even if you're not close enough to hit Riku. If you see that Dark Aura is Riku's next sleight, if he uses Dark Aura a couple times in a row you will have effectively forfeited the battle. Even with a dodge strategy as perfect as I our own DPS being minmaxed as high as I could making the battle still theoretically unwinnable. There is, however, one more strategy we can If our DPS isn't good enough even at our best, his worst. As any decent Chain of Memories player should player. When he performs a sleight, the first stocked That means the more sleights we dodge, the the more frequently he'll reload. While this is a minor boost to our own DPS, gets shaved down, he'll become more and more since, as mentioned before, he'll only attack harder and harder. That means, while we start the battle with will reverse, and with a sufficiently hesitant stretches of the battle without taking damage. In order for this strategy to work, there's use Elixir cards, which will restore all the resetting his DPS to its highest. You must counter all five Elixirs to prevent Not only does this require quick reaction of luck, since he'll sometimes use these elixirs And... that's it. That is everything I know about Riku. The rest is up to you. *exasperated laughter* Oh my gah! Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my gah! Oh my gaaaahd! Oh hya- ah! Ah! Ahhhhhh, ah. Aha, ahhhhhahaha. Agggh, aha, mmmmmmm. &quot;Save your game, save your game, save your No! I don't care! If my power goes out, screw it, I'm cheating! I'm announcing to the entire world that if go- I'm just gonna redo the fight with a million Ye-whatever, who cares? I'm just gonna like g- I'm just gonna pretendsies g-g- it's fine, who cares? I did it, I friggin' did it! With Riku 4 defeated, frantically run back and enjoy the realization that you will be 2. Before the battle even begins, pause the game, ice cream, eat one while failing to hold back up the entire security team, interrogate them perform an eldritch ritual on Walt Disney's second tub of ice cream and tell him to give apology note forged in Sora's handwriting. Walk back home, unpause the game, and breath a perplexed Sora and enter battle with the As I'm sure you suspect, even with Donald She's now got a buffed up deck, a way bigger long enough, a similarly ultra deadly phase death sleight. But you'll never get that far, because she's we still have no way to dodge it. This battle is practically impossible with never before seen on VG Myths: I put out a Anybody who could find a reliable method to steam keys from my baggy of extras, with a horrid trash. Believe it or not, this incredible prize did As far as humanity knows, Larxene's lightning unreliable strategy of politely asking her Once again, we just have to accept that as take damage over time. The only way to win is to keep that damage In order to do that, we can't afford absolutely lightning. First, dealing damage to Larxene with our putting ourselves at risk of a counter-counter Unlike Riku, Larxene will rarely turn her I did some experimentation and discovered time. I'd been playing my Attack card normally, But alternatively, you can stock your Attack This seems like it would be both completely card unreloadable, but both are false. Remember that secret rule that the player in their deck? In order to ensure the player never runs out if the player sleights their final Attack That means we can sleight our Attack card As for why we'd even bother, see the comparison On the left, we play our Attack card the normal via single-card sleight. Presumably to make sleights go by faster, and Sora will likewise be given back his freedom As long as we attack Larxene with single-card risk of a counter. This discovery was ludicrously huge, making Next up is minimizing damage when Larxene Since we can't actually dodge Larxene's lightning, our entire strategy on preventing her from Since she's capable of comboing these lightning into wasting time, during which we can charge Stick relatively close, but not too close, deck in the bottom-right corner of the screen. While it's not a guarantee, Larxene will frequently attack, and the cards behind it are likely If Sora is within a certain range when Larxene card, she'll harmlessly backflip before the reload and dodge. If she uses a blue background Attack card, If you were properly positioned, you'll have Important note, you'll have a little bit of When she finally plays a dreaded lightning damage. If she uses too many in a row, dip into your An equal value card is ideal, negating the If you have to summon him, it's still usually Pluto which is less likely to be countered. Obviously, if you've run out of counter options, decides to miss. While preparing to counter lightning is the with your Attack cards: if you're fully charged her deck, go ahead and get some extra damage full reload before the next lightning. Both her phase 1 sleights have huge wind-up After many, many, many hours of practice, Phase 2 in almost every attempt. Phase 2 has two differences. First, like in the prior battle, her melee of 4 melee hits and finishing with a small The second two hits have similar dodge timing more likely to miss than her actual proper larger risk if you mess up, successful dodging Larxene's second Phase 2 upgrade is the Teleport you need to be ready to counter it instantly, She has too much health to blaze past Phase banking on getting some major damage in with Try to sleight them when Larxene has exhausted reloading. The less cards she has in her deck, the less With absolutely astronomically ludicrously good enough at video games to turn the tables small chance of getting hit by lightning. If you made it this far, congrats, you've hardest boss fight I have ever partaken in This battle caused me actual genuine physical me from even holding a controller, which only The good news is you won't be facing anything of this run, but the bad news is it's not Enter the game's final, 13th floor: Castle You can and should skip absolutely all random Just rush to the story rooms to continue this Axel 2 is laughably easy and basically unchanged But in the final room you'll fight the penultimate While this battle occurs in a larger arena more space to dodge. For one of Marluxia's three main attacks, which cause ludicrously over-the-top damage However, if you pay attention, you'll notice opposite directions before joining together. If Sora is positioned within this sweet spot, For the duration of this battle, keep yourself He'll do his best to awkwardly sidestep in so be extremely careful, moving even slightly Otherwise, you have two attacks to watch out summon three spinning vortexes which are practically a far stupider blind spot: as soon as Marluxia tucking yourself in a corner of this rectangular This can put you in a risky spot after since If he throws them, dodge with two rolls in His third standard attack is what I like to and attack with a painful melee combo. At first I couldn't dodge this because the the combo felt random. Sometimes he'd attack immediately, while others Eventually, though, I realized what was going Sora is facing directly toward him. Knowing this, embrace the circle and start Marluxia is surprisingly talented at following This can be used in two ways: first, if you move in whatever direction you choose. If you're not comfortable a your current location, thus giving you more space to retreat. Second, it allows you to manually end the roll to bait and dodge Marluxia's attack. Now that we've got each of Marluxia's standard his sleights. The one to look out for most starts with a next to Sora and instantly attack. Always be aware if Marluxia has one of these His other sleights have longer windup times issue, including his Phase 2 super duper sleight because I never needed to bother. With HoloMarluxia defeated, save the game Vanilla Marluxia, split into 2 phases which As a breath of fresh air, Phase 1 is easy the same attacks in a specific order. Don't bother attacking the scythes, the only scythe attack, which is so easy to dodge it Lock on to Marluxia himself and deal damage When he summons flower turrets, he'll start break one of his cards. The full set is difficult to dodge, so get and counter the second, jumping up near Marluxia With only a single turret left, you should up on reloads. When Marluxia takes control of the camera, damage upon the attack's conclusion. If he summons a dark orb, Sora will suffer in your deck will be shrouded in darkness. Oh no. Upon reaching Phase 1 Phase 2, Marluxia's apparent critical design flaw, replacing them First, a charge attack which you can invulnerability roll. Second, a less dodgeable ground pound. Just focus on reloading and counter at the If done properly, you'll always be able to With both phases of Phase 1 down, our health True Final Marluxia. At first glance he appears to be easy, since until you encounter his 666 sleight: Death If you allow Death Sentence to activate, you'll under a 6 second time limit. You are allowed to reload, but that won't are doomed. And there's no checkpoint here: if you die get another chance. When Marluxia uses Death Sentence, he'll always You should be able to counter the first two, To do this, stick right in front of Marluxia's hands in the air. This works sometimes, but if it doesn't, you're up a few Plutos, Donalds, and Goofies. Expend only as many of these as you need to Sentence later. He also has a 777 sleight which is easy to around the field. Oh no. As for standard attacks, most dangerous, but As before, counter the first two attacks ASAP, free reload time. And to really minmax, wait until immediately from play to attack. This deals damage without technically performing in play longer to bank more reload. Marluxia also has an attack that will blow deal a small amount of damage if Sora is too The end of the arena is a short walk away, Unfortunately, dodging Death Sentence requires was too afraid to back up and tended to just Once you reach Phase 2 Phase 2, Marluxia will new sleights. I genuinely have no idea what these do other I gave it my all to counter as many as I could enough. With Char finally given a death sentence of 1 Card Run is an Ultimate Mission Complete! If you're interested in trying the run yourself, yourself and take regular breaks. In fact, love yourself and give yourself regular in a totally reasonable way. Trust me, your hands will thank you. And finally, special shout out to Pacey8444, similar ruleset inspired the full game run. And double finally, if you're interested, throughout the run, found on my No Commentary And triple finally, if you're curious, yes it doesn't help me in any tangible way. In fact, I'm upping the ante, I'm throwing not work. And quadruple finally, special thanks to all Let me know how much this video sucks and Ten thousand thunderbolts for watching, and
