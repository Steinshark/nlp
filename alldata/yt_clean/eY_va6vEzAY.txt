Baby Bot. [music] Good morning. Morning. [music] [sings]. Hi, Billy! Oh! What's that?! Why is the lady crying, Billy? Is she hurt?! [shushes across the audience] Ma'am, are you okay?! Don't cry. Do you want to play? I have a ball. You are ruining the opera. Can't you keep quiet and let us enjoy the music? Music? What is music? Don't you know anything about music? I know nothing! but I can learn. Machines can't learn music. [music] What's wrong, Baby Bot? The man says I can't learn music because I'm a machine. No way. You're not a machine, you're Baby Bot. [smooches] Do you want me to teach you everything I know about music? Yes. Music is so rad. It makes you relax or it makes you want to dance. It can make you happy or it can make you sad. Music is amazing and this is the reason why. [drums] Samba, my favorite style to dance to. [music] Sometimes, I like wilder music like rock. [music] Yes, that was fun! And now, get ready for some classical music. [music] [applause] Wow. There are even more types of music, Baby Bot. From polka to techno. From flamenco to jazz, and there are many, many more. What's your favorite? All of them. I know music. I know music, I do. Billy! I know music!! Music. A-One. A-two. A-one, two, three, four.

I think Billy is saying it's time to build, Don't be angry, Cowy! He just wants to build a great robot. Oh, Cowy... I don't know if that's such a good idea... Oh, boy... I didn't say anything! Sorry Billy We have to be practical, Billy. The contest is about to start. Why don't we give them a chance? Don't worry Billy! The rest of the robots aren't so good. Don't worry Billy! The rest of the robots aren't so good. Eh... Maybe I was wrong. Math test What is the mass of the Universe? Correct! Strength test What is the answer to life, the Universe and everything? Forty-two.

Launching translation. -[chirping] -You come from a long line of robots, Baby Bot, each designed to do different things. Behold, this is one of the first robots, called an automaton. It was made of metal and powered by steam, which made it super strong. [mechanical sounds] [steam] -[giggling] [steam] -Yay. -[chirping] -Automatons could only do one thing at a time, but not for long. -[chooo!] -Soon, robots became more advanced, like this arm bot, that builds cars. -[running] [tripping] Oh. [mechanical sounds] -[giggling] -[chirping] -[giggling] -Eventually, robots were able to go through complex obstacle courses. [running] [cheering] [running] [crashing] [buzz] -[giggling] [mechanical sounds] [sad music] -[sighs] [door opening] -And last but not least, the best of the best, the creme of the crop, the greatest robot in history. This robot can laugh and dance. -I can do that. -And sing. -[gasps] I can do that too. -And love. -[giggling] -[gasps] I am the best robot? -Of course, you are, Baby Bot. -Me? -[chirping] [kiss] -How touching. -We made you with love. -Wow.
