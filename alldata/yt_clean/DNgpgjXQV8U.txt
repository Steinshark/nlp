[English subtitles are available] [Country T] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome! What else do you do now besides boxing gambling? I'm not interested in anything else. I just want to make money. I don't understand these boxers. They earn only a few tens of thousands of yuan a month. Is it worth risking their lives for? They are not like Mr. Xue's bodyguards who can do everything. They only know how to box. But today, I really want to see a bodyguard and a desperate boxer fight each other. It must be very exciting. Next, let's welcome the sexy beauty, Jessica! Jessica! Jessica! Jessica! Jessica! Now let's give an equally warm applause to the challenger from the ancient country of the east, Gao Tian! Help me! Gao Tian! Gao Tian! Help me! Mr. Xue. Where are you? What happened? Reverse the car! Let's go! If either of you lose your combat ability or admit defeat, the game will be over. Are you ready? Help me, Gao Tian! -Mr. Xue, are you alright? -Help me! Gao Tian! Help me! Gao Tian! Take him. Move! [Bodyguard] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You want to hear a sound? Does this sound good? Bad luck. Let him in. You've lost. Don't be a sore loser. Who are you talking about? This is the boxing court. Do you dare to shoot? Harmony brings wealth. Can't you remember? Boss. Beat him! An incapable soldier only affects himself. But an incapable general can affect the whole army. Say that again! There are rules in the arena. Since you broke the rules, please leave immediately. Any news? It seems that Mr. Xue's taste is just so. This one is too weak. What he cares about is not on the surface. Oh. In a way, we are half partners. If you have any problem, just tell me. I will certainly help you. What can you do for me? Xue Feng. Xue Feng. You know where he is? He's my partner and your boss. I'm asking you because he's my boss. You know his whereabouts? That day, he called me to check the accounts. I waited for him all day in the company, but I didn't see him. Guess what happened next? I won't tell you. I won't tell you. I usually record business affairs. I suspect the accounts handled by Basong are not clean. Do you have access to the accounts? Don't worry. I'll find a way. The new drug will be put into the international market soon. At this time, no mistake is allowed. Don't worry. Okay. Boss. Someone made a scene at the boxing court yesterday. Who? Basong. Basong? He's a tough guy. He seems to be running a financial company, but he's a drug dealer. Forget it. Okay. Hello, it's me. Basong is in the financial company. I know. I'm watching him. I want to check his accounts. Do you want to go with me? I'll keep an eye on Basong. If Mr. Xue is in his hands, he will give himself away. Okay. Let's split up. Bye. Sorry, I... Are you stupid? What are you thinking? What are you thinking? And you. What did I say? What did I usually say to you? Get in. Hurry up. Accounts? I'm afraid not. Why not? I'm your business partner. And your company is hired by our company. Why can't I see them? Well, please have a seat. I'll get the accounts out for you. Thank you. [Loading the surrounding terrain map] [The surrounding terrain map loading completed] Don't move. Who are you? This is not good. Mr. Bancai. This is bad. I'm sorry. Give me what I want. Then the money will be yours. I can't take it. How about this? After this, you come to my company and work for me. Okay. Thank you. The accounts of Basong's company have big problems. Yes. If Basong wants to cover up the problems of the accounts, it's totally possible for him to capture Mr. Xue. What do you plan to do? I have a lot of information about Basong's villa. But I only have tools for detection. I don't have enough equipment or manpower. I need backup. I can get some equipment for you. But I can't do anything about manpower. As you can see, besides my secretary and driver, the most capable ones here are the security guards. I'll find a way to deal with the manpower. Please take care of the equipment. Okay. Don't mention it. We both want to find Mr. Xue. Right? Please. Okay. Gao Tian. I understand what you mean. But distant water does not quench present thirst. Besides, old teammates have tasks. New teammates lack experience. Ping, Isn't there any other way? Zhang Chi. You can go to him. He was fired by the security company for a mistake. Now, he's on a construction site of Country T. Zhang Chi. Gao Tian. Hello. Hello. [Certificate of Honor] [Zhang Chi] [was awarded the title of Outstanding Bodyguard for his excellent performance and conscientious work in the TCX Africa Escort Operation] Ping said your vacation should be over. Tell me. We'll sign a temporary external contract. After the rescue mission, Ping will help you recover the file with the mission information. The mission target is to save the employer of my last mission, Xue Feng, a famous Chinese entrepreneur. He was kidnapped on the way to the financial company in Country T. The initial suspect is the owner of the financial company, Basong. This place is heavily guarded. All security guards have guns. Let's go. Candy. [Somewhere in China] Calculate how many clients complained about you this year. Let me tell you. If it happens again, get lost! Enough. Don't be angry. Remember to arrange a flight to Country T for me tomorrow. You... Remember, I'm the boss. Get lost! When you come back, go to the training camp for three-month extra training. Dynamite. He comes to Country T every time after his mission. His protection ability and close combat ability can rank the top 30 in the security world. His only weakness is with guns. Without this, he could be in the top five. Dynamite. This is an internationally renowned and outstanding bodyguard who started his career at the same time as me. Gao Tian. Si Tu. a rich second generation, and a super military fan. He was prevented by his family from joining the army. Then he became a security guard and won three National Security Sniper Competition in consecutive years. He later learned that his parents had bought his current security company in order to keep him out of security missions. So till now, Si Tu has never participated in real combat. What are you looking at? Beat him! Come on! Bro! Bro! I was wrong. I'm sorry. Get lost! Okay. Let's go. Go. Si Tu. No matter how good you are in the drill, it's all fake. Are you interested in real combat? Overall, it's hard to break in. We know that they have guns, but we don't know if they have heavy firearms. Their defense and surveillance facilities are complete. That means we don't have a chance to conduct further investigation. Although their surveillance facilities are complete, there are still blind spots. That means there is no military or professional security in their team. This is our biggest advantage. Si Tu. What about you? A perfect challenge. I've only experienced it in my dreams. Gao Tian. Thank you so much. Si Tu. I know. I just think that you are too serious. It's not good for our actions in the future. Don't worry. I'm here. Who did it? It's me. Why are you here? Why are you here? I'm here to help you. What kind of attitude is that? What attitude are you expecting? We haven't seen each other for so long. Of course I want to see if your kung fu has regressed. Besides, I flew all the way here. It's fine that you don't welcome me, but you scolded me. Who allowed you to come? Ping, of course. You think I snuck out? Hey. More help, greater chance to succeed. Introduce yourself. Hello, everyone. My name is Candy. I'm Tian's junior. I always followed Tian when I was in school. I work in Tian's company now. I'm Zhang Chi. I'm also your senior. Hello, Senior. I'm Dynamite. Your kung fu is good. Let's have a match sometime. No problem. Si Tu. Let me make it clear. It's not a compound surname. I've been in this industry for years. But I've never participated in real combat. Besides, you're pretty. Thank you. This is also my first mission out. Let's make a rescue plan. I'm the partner and legal representative of Dingfeng Biomedical Technology Co., Ltd.. My name is Bancai. This is your equipment. This is the gun permit. I have another piece of good news. This is the floor plan of the Basong's residence we drew. It will definitely help you. Uncle Bancai. You've helped a lot. You should call me grandpa. Okay, Grandpa. Take care. Hey. Hey. Mr. Nie, let's discuss it. Let go. -Darn it. -We need to discuss. Why are you leaving in a hurry? We need to discuss. You fool. What kind... What kind of a person did you get? The sparrow is back. Prepare to shoot. Roger. Move! What a strange weather today. It's not raining there. It's raining here. Come and rain on me. Turn around. Turn around. I can't see. All right. Report. Basong is at the pool. He is surrounded by security and armed guards. Follow my order. The action is to shoot Basong and break in from the front. Roger. Let's go. Boss. This time the quality of the goods has improved again. Okay. Baby. Let's do something more exciting. Get ready. I'll raise the price by 20%. I've met those bumpkins. If you think it's expensive, I'll give all the goods to them. Action. Roger. Don't be nervous. Don't be nervous. Don't be nervous. What's going on? Retreat. Darn it. Break in! Who are these people? Let's get out through the secret passage. Split up! Hurry! Retreat! Hurry! Hurry! Don't move. Retreat! Boss. Hello. Jump. Are you okay? I'm fine. Let's go. Boss. Boss! The exit was blown up. Check the equipment. Let's break out! Yes. Don't move! Kill them! Who are you? Give Xue Feng to us. We'll retreat immediately. Xue Feng? Bro, you must be mistaken. Help me. I didn't kidnap him. Run! Target down. Mission complete. I want to go to the boxing court tomorrow. The more complicated the place is, the faster the news circulates. Okay. Let's split up tomorrow. Soup with Pepper? Yes. Come and eat. Eat up. Okay. Delicious. You soaked the pan-fried buns in Soup with Pepper? Is it delicious? It is. It tastes good. How is it? Is my cooking delicious? Yes. It's been a long time since I had a breakfast with the flavor of my hometown Henan. Is it made by you? Of course. Otherwise, by you? I just didn't expect you can cook. You look like a boy. Do I? Then... So you like tender girls? The girl and I had better like each other. Otherwise, I'd rather be single forever. Well. Before I came to Country T, I thought Soup with Pepper was salty. Well. I didn't expect it's even sweeter than candy. Of course. I'm not talking about you. This Soup with Pepper is quite sweet. So sweet. It's sweet? What's wrong with you? Hey. If a girl who likes you very much and even worships you suddenly comes to you and tells you she likes you, what would you do? Impossible. I'm so boring. Who would like me? I... Hey, Zhang Chi. Yes. I'll go to Bancai with Candy later. You just go to the boxing court as you said yesterday. Okay. Eat. It's delicious. Shouldn't we come at night to inquire? Isn't it too early to come now? No. How can we find Mr. Xue's news at night? After all, it's too influential. Only a few people know about it. How did you get in? The door was open, so we came in. What? Are you closed? We want to meet the person in charge. We don't welcome rude people. Besides, I don't know your real identity. So please leave. Hey. Listen. We are not guests? Also, you don't know our identity. Can't you ask yourself? Just you guys... We mean no harm. We just want to meet the person in charge. Jessica! Stop! How is it? Do you have any news about Mr. Xue from Basong? Mr. Xue is not at Basong's place? You have to say something. You can't just shake your heads. Basong is dead. You... You killed him? Not us. We... How could he die? If he's dead, then, where can we find Mr. Xue? I want to ask you whether you have any new clues. What clues can I have? Mr. Xue has always been busy with work and charities. Who is so... Who would do such a thing? Could it be... What? Could it be that they did it for our new drug? New drug? It'll be troublesome if that's the case. Our company relies on Mr. Xue alone. We can't live without him. Please help us find Mr. Xue as soon as possible, okay? Don't worry. I'm here. Well. Where did the others go? They went to the boxing court to inquire. Yes. There must be news at the boxing court. I'm a member there. Can we go together? Let's go. We do have some news about Mr. Xue. But I can't tell you. What happened yesterday has spread. Now you're like shooting targets. So I'm sorry. Excuse me. I don't quite get it. The boxing court won't involve in anything related to any force. It's not beneficial to us. Understand? Please leave. Is this how premium members are treated? Of course not. You are most welcome. I think I've made myself clear. The boxing court is a place for the rich to entertain and the boxers to survive. We don't want to get involved in meaningless trouble. We'll get the news if we pay the price. Isn't this the rule of the boxing court? If I spread the news of your rejection, how can your boxing court continue to operate? I can tell you. But you have to follow our rules. How much? It's free. Fight with our men. How many people are there in your team? Five. A scuffle of ten. The one who can stand will win. Anyone who loses his combat power or admits defeat, can stop. I trust you. Protect yourselves. Okay. If this competition is at night, you will make a lot of money, right? If it's at night, you won't have a chance. Awesome. They two are so cruel. I really admire you now. This matter currently has a very limited scope of dissemination. And someone is deliberately controlling the spread of it. And your action yesterday is known to few people. But don't worry. Xue Feng must be safe now. Please. Good. They are very strong. I even want to keep them. No matter how strong they are, they are fooled by others. After this matter is over, contact them and see if we can poach them here. Yes. Bei. Let me touch your nose. Good kid. This is the result of the board meeting. We hope to hold a press conference as soon as possible to announce our new drug and our products. Isn't this too soon? We also studied it. We hope to lure the enemies out and get some information about Mr. Xue. This will also help you. Right? Okay. Okay. Then I'll count on you. Thank you. Si Tu. Find a chance to sneak into the boxing court and install tapping devices in meeting rooms and offices. Dynamite. Candy. Keep an eye on Jian with me. I'll find a chance to install a GPS in Jian's car. I repeat. The target has appeared. Let's see if we can find clues through Jian. Zhang Chi stays at home and coordinates. Be careful. It's so heavy. Try harder. Come on. The tapping devices are in place. They're in good condition. A few days ago, a team of mercenaries came to our country for a vacation. I've discussed with their captain. You will meet them at the boxing court tonight and see if they have enough time. Ask them to investigate Bancai and those bodyguards. Yes. Hey. Hey. I asked you to shower the elephant, not me. Get lost if you don't want to work here. Would you get lost or not? Get ready for the first round. Stop betting in five minutes. I don't know what mission your team had carried out, but I only have a simple request, which is to find out the background of these people in the video. I don't think this is a simple task. We came to Country T mainly to rest. Now, you want us to investigate a few people for you. Your offer is too low. I pay you based on the risk of your mission. Isn't a mission with low risk what you want? Maybe. But now I prefer a good rest. Sorry. Dynamite. Keep an eye on Jian. I'll go to Basong's place again. Let's go. Why are you here? I want to find some clues here. I did. There is no clue. Basong produces and sells drugs. The evidence is solid. And he forged the accounts and caused a huge loss to our company. After the police's investigation, the board pressured the government. The government decided to auction his house to make up for our company's loss. We monitored the illegal boxing market but found nothing. Right. Later, come with us to the press conference. Okay. Mr. Bancai. [Innovative Drug Press Conference] Has the efficacy of the new drug you developed for Alzheimer's disease been proven? Is it as miraculous as the publicity said? Thank you for your question. I can tell you exactly that the new drug we developed and are about to launch recently has been strictly tested by the market and on 3,200 Alzheimer's patients. The cure rate for mild patients has reached 85%, and the cure rate of severe patients has reached 78%. Okay. Mr. Bancai. Mr. Bancai. Mr. Xue Feng, the chairman of your company was said to be kidnapped and is still missing. How did you respond to this rumor? Sir, I don't know where you got the information, but I can give you an exact answer. Chairman Xue is doing good. He was sick due to work strain recently, so he was unable to participate in today's press conference. He's in good condition. Target on the move. The direction is the same as yesterday afternoon. We'll be right there. Get in. Kevin. Get someone to the house. Take out the guy in charge of the dispatch. Take care of those two in front of us. Okay. Move. Don't move! Go! Gao Tian. This is a trap. Haven't you learned how to shoot while moving at high speed? Is this shooting while moving at high speed? How about asking me to stand on a plane and shoot? Fasten your seat belt. Exciting. Stalking me is your most irrational behavior. Behave yourself. Where is Xue Feng? What do you want? I told you we won't get involved in any of these. Our hands are tied because you. Now you said you won't get involved. You stalked and investigated me first. Shouldn't I know why? Fine. Let me ask you now. Where is Xue Feng? Xue Feng is safe now, but I don't know the details. The boss told me not to get involved. Even if it's just information. Then your boss... You know very well that as long as I get our information, we will leave immediately. I'll come and apologize later. Boss. Is everything settled? They are still not awake yet. We need to teach them a lesson. Why is it so quiet over there? My boss didn't give me a chance to ask. But don't worry. They won't ignore you. Tie them up. Zhang Chi. Dynamite, report the current situation. Zhang Chi. Dynamite, report the current situation. Hello? What's going on? We were attacked. They know our every move. And they have a signal blocker and micro submachine gun. How's it going over there? Let's talk about it when we meet. Don't go back to the villa. They might still be waiting there. Let's go to the place where we first met. It's on the opposite hill. By the way, get a new taxi. Look at this. Here is a breaking news. At around 11 p.m. tonight, a homicide occurred in Xin Tai Villa area. Seventeen people died. The murderer is still on the run. This is exciting. We are now fugitives. Tell me what's going on with Jian. Jian has nothing to do with Mr. Xue. She just wanted to give me a warning. If she wants to harm us, Candy and I wouldn't have come out alive. Besides, Jian is dead now. How did Jian die? What do you mean? Are you suspecting us? We only tied her up. We didn't kill her. Looks like we are misled. Put it on speaker. Hello? You... Are you okay? We're fine. But we can't show up now. I see. I have a house in the suburb. Why don't you stay there for a while? No need. Don't contact us for the time being. Take care of yourself. Okay. Call me if you need anything. Also, be careful. Take care. Okay. They're moving too fast. They must have gotten what they want from Mr. Xue. Not necessarily. If they get what they want, we won't be wanted now. They must want to trap us to buy more time. We can't wait any longer. The longer we wait, the more we are at risk. Leave the equipment to me. Just tell me what you need me to do. Is it Gao Tian? Our boss wants to see you. Hello. I'm Dan, the new person in charge of the boxing ring. This is our boss, Mr. Parra. Hello. Gao Tian. We didn't kill Jian. I know. And I know who killed Jian. Why do you want to see us? To talk about a cooperation. The one who killed Jian was a mercenary named Kunka. He's an experienced veteran who has strong reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance skills. As for cooperation, we'll provide you Xue Feng's current location and equipment for rescue. After you finish the mission, get Kunka for me. I thought you don't involved in any fight. Pull it away. That's why I'm looking for you. Anyone who dares to provoke people of the boxing court shall be punished. This is your punishment. If you don't agree, all of you have to die. We agreed. But we need more details. Okay. Okay. Bring it in. All right. Let my Bei take some rest. Look at the sky. The whole incident is misled by people. So the information you got is not accurate. Of course, what Jian told you is the truth. But due to the rules of the boxing ring, she can't say too much. Actually, I can't say much as well. I can only tell you Xue Feng is in an abandoned factory due east of the suburbs. Who kidnapped him? I don't know. You'll know when you get there. But I have to remind you that Kunka has a group of skilled mercenaries. They said they're here for a trip. I don't think so. I need to continue the investigation. After you save Xue Feng, I will tell you the details. That's all? That's all. You didn't give any information other than the location of Xue Feng. I'll give you ten seconds to make the decision. Yes. Yes. We promise that we'll come to you again after we save Xue Feng. I look forward to working with you. Take the equipment. Sign it. So you can leave safely and I can complete the mission successfully. It's a win-win situation. I will never sign this contract. It seems that I need to show you something before you understand your situation. Your bodyguards have made a lot of money for my boss. Do you think you still have hope? Get ready. Run! I won't let my assets fall into your hands. Boss. There has been a breach. Dismiss! Fight back! Yes. Check with the spot number 3 of Team 1. Yes sir. Team 1, closing toward your northwest side. Everyone else, press the enemy into area X. This is Dynamite. This is Dynamite. Copy that. I've reached the control room. Xue Feng is in area 3C where Candy is the closest. Besides, Kunka is approaching Zhang Chi with his men. How dare you take my gun? We've arrived the target point. Stand by. Understood. Zhang Chi. There's a door on your left. Go in, hide and wait for we. Roger that. Come out and turn back. Turn left at the first crossing. There is a path after you turn left. Go to area 3C immediately. Control room. Control room. Why did he disappear in front of me? Siege every passage. Except Xue Feng, kill everyone else. You... Take people to the control room. Okay. Kunka already knows I'm here. The mercenaries blocked all passages. Be careful. I'll be right there. I'll go. Thermal weapons don't suit me. Are you going to sign it or not? Keep hanging if you don't. Just keep hanging there. Why did you help them? Were you bribed? We were used. Let's go out first. Let's go. Gao Tian. He is one of us. Gao Tian. They found me. I'll take the fire for you. Speed up! Dynamite! Tell me your location. I can stall for another five minutes. Let's go. What's wrong? Don't move. Dynamite! Dynamite! Interesting. It's him. He kidnapped me. Kung Fu Iron Head? Damn you! This vacation is a delight. Let's go. Stand here. Kunka. It seems that the bodyguards' information isn't falling behind. Why did you kidnap my boss? I... I'll answer. Bancai. Why is it you? It's me. Why? Let me tell you the reason. Because you killed my son. You're smart. I didn't show up just to wait for you to sign the new drug's patent transfer contract. Otherwise, I wouldn't have let you live to this day. I've explained it to you before. It has nothing to do with me. You know that. You went abroad with him, but you told me he was dead. The car that was involved in the accident was yours. The accident happened near your house. It was an accident. I'm his father. I know him very well. He never smokes or drinks. But you told me he was taking drugs. Bancai. I always treat your son as mine. When I heard about his accident, I felt the same way as you. I know you're stubborn. But calmly think about it, I have no reason to hurt him. Besides, the police have proved my innocence. You've been using us. You are good helpers. What about Basong? He must die. People are dead because of his drugs, including my son. Take Mr. Xue away. Chase after him! Get in! Get down! You can't hide it. Why don't you come out and kill me? Or hand Xue Feng over and I'll let you go. Okay. Okay. I'll hand him over. Let's go. Bancai. Listen to me. Let me explain. Bancai. You're starting to disobey me. I promised to let you go and I'll keep my word. Xue Feng killed my son but you are protecting him. Is there any truth in this world? Since you want to die, Fine. I'll grant your wish. Mr. Xue, go. Bancai. You're not behaving well. Candy. Candy! Tian. It's okay. It's okay. Leave now. Tian. If it weren't for you, Xue Feng would have been in my hands. Bancai. You're wrong. Stop! He killed my son. You said I was wrong. Don't you know a life for a life? Go! Dynamite. Zhang... Zhang Chi. Zhang Chi. Gao Tian. Gao Tian! Go. Zhang Chi. Si Tu. Now it's personal. I'm Dynamite. You're good. Let's have a match sometime. Gao Tian. Hello. Let's go. Security competition is not as exciting as using real weapons. By the way, what's the name of our team? Guardians, loyal to the lord and defend with their lives. Candy. You're dead! Let's die together! Tian! Tian! Tian! Tian! Tian! Candy. Where is Mr. Xue? Xue... Mr. Xue is dead. What? Senior. I'm sorry. Don't move. Let's go. It's okay. Let's go. Mr. Xue, my career as bodyguard is over. [Europe Country E] Call it or fold it? Come on. Again? All in. What about you? I am out. It's your turn. Call it? Call it. What do you mean? I'll buy you a drink. See you next time. Good luck on filming. Wishing a huge box office success. Did you hit your head? He hit his head. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Tissue. Tissue. Don't gather around. Replay. Replay. Pass. Pass. [Emergency Surgery Room 7x24 hours] [At Your Service] A dozen stitches, I think. I have no choice. If you want a good action scene, you have to go for it. At least the result is good. Although I got hurt, the shot has high level of completion. It's worth it. A good action scene requires to take some risks. It's normal to get hurt. It's normal. As long as I don't die and don't affect the shooting. What? Let's do it again. The bodyguard's information isn't falling behind. I'm counting on him. I went out as soon as you dodged. I heard the sound. This person... He's still pretending to be a good person. This is for you. This is for you. You can have it. It's not mine. Because it is the recordist's. Good. You didn't show up, right? No. Does it sound good? It didn't get on you, did it? He makes money through civil and martial ways. Are you okay? Are you okay? It's like an explosion here. I hit my wound. Don't laugh. The machine doesn't need to follow the people for now. I'll call you. I'll call you. Okay, ready. Action. Bro. Are you kidding me? You even brought this? The blood is all over my face. Come on. Come on. Ready. Ready. Bodyguard. Awesome. No, this is not enough. Bodyguard. Awesome. Okay, eat that first. That's all? Get lost! I'm paying you based on the risk of your mission. It's okay. Don't wipe it. It's useless. It left a mark. Up, up, up. Here? Ouch! It hurts. Didn't I tell you to step on the brake? You can run after they get down. Let's go. We're done. Looking forward to part three. It's a wrap! It's a wrap!
