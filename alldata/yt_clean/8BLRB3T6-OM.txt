Hi! We're at Kyoto Station. Today, we're staying at a beautiful ryokan in Kyoto. Kyoto is a bus society You can get to most of the famous tourist spots by bus. We wanted to take the 206 line bus, but... it's too crowded to get on Giving up, we're heading to the bus stop on the opposite side of the station. I've heard rumors, but Kyoto really is crowded with people these days. We've come to the opposite exit (Hachijo Exit). It's relatively less crowded here. We can also take the 71 line bus to the inn. Here is it! Kyoto buses are tricky. We considered taking a taxi, but we're glad the bus came. We're heading to the Omiya Matsubara bus stop, about 20 minutes away on the 71 line bus. Ah, a five-storied pagoda! That's Toji Temple over there. Thank you Our ryokan for today is just a 2-minute walk from the bus stop. Here. The gate that's so Kyoto-like is lovely. You can leave your baggage before check-in. Right at the entrance, there's a souvenir shop. Baggage drop-off complete. Check-in is after 3 PM, so let's go sightseeing until then. If you're heading out for sightseeing from the hotel, let's use the Shijo Omiya Station, just a 5-minute walk away. &quot;Randen&quot; A convenient train for Arashiyama sightseeing. It's simpler than the city bus and not too crowded. Above all, since it's a tram, the scenery is enjoyable! Cars are running right next to it Oh? This looks cute. Arrived at Arashiyama Station. Right next to the tracks is the Kimono Forest. Poles are filled with kimono fabrics. There are several kimono rental shops around, so you'll see many people wearing kimonos. To the main street of Arashiyama. Rickshaws run, and the street is lined with souvenir shops, eateries, and snack stands. Three-color dango: 150 yen Arashiyama Sagano Croquette: 350 yen Matcha Soft Serve: 550 yen Warabi Mochi Kinako: 396 yen And this is the iconic view of the mountains of Arashiyama. That bridge is the Togetsukyo Bridge. The weather isn't great today, but the mist looks cool too. Arashiyama is very beautiful and a wonderful place Time to head back. We're back. Time to check in. &gt;&gt; Staff: Let me show you the way The staff will guide us to our room. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Staff: This is Tsubaki Street This ryokan has been renovated from a whole alley of townhouses over 110 years old. It beautifully expresses the Kyoto-like townscape. Amazing.
