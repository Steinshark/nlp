Binjiang County Government will rely on location advantages to integrate tourism resources, focusing on building a tourism demonstration project represented by the Lenggu Tourism Resort. Under the unified command and control of the county government, the land requisition and relocation around the construction of Lenggu Tourism Resort is being carried out in an orderly manner. The county government will distribute compensation for land acquisition and relocation in a fair and just manner in accordance with the Administrative Measures for Compensation for Expropriation of Collective Land and Houses in Binjiang County. In addition, the county government has taken many measures to promote the transformation of the industrial structure and to enhance the dynamics and effectiveness of the city. Tell them to stop working. Get outta here! Get outta here! Right now! Hurry up! Murder! Get out of here! Put down the knife. Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! Go back and tell Wei Tianlang that as long as I, Gu Dahe, am alive, no one will ever tear this place down. Beat him up! Beat him up! Put it down. I'll stab anyone who comes near. Isn't it over yet? How do you do your job? Put it down! Hurry up! Put it down! Come here! Come here! Put it down! Get away from me! Put it down! Have a cigarette! Who are you posting this for? Did they pay you less? Did they give you a penny less? I'm telling you, as long as I'm alive, I can't move. Come on. That, That's your mom's grave, isn't it? You won't move because the grave is here. You're too embarrassed to move, aren't you? No problem. Come on, dig up his mom's grave. Mom! Mom! Don't move. Mom! This urn is my housewarming gift to your mom. Boss, two bowls of watery tofu. Okay. Master, the one sitting over there is wanted criminal Sun Ming. I see him. Master, let's go. Let's eat first. Enjoy your meal. Okay, Master. I'm done. Master. You go back and inform the team. By the way, buy two more boxes of plasters. Sweating so much, it's a weakness. Eat more spicy food. Who are you? What's wrong with you? Come with me. Get up. Master, this is the 278th person you've arrested in 10 years on the force, right? You have a good memory. Help me with the plaster. Okay. Master, do you need to go to the hospital? No. Commissioner! What's going on? We received a report two days ago. Your hometown, Binjiang, has seen the emergence of a vicious force. They've committed violence against the people, demolished houses, dug up graves, and embezzled compensation for land acquisition and relocation. I sent the video to your cell phone. Wrap it up. Report to the Binjiang police station. Okay, got it. My name is Gu Dahe, is a villager from Lenggu village in Binjiang County. I am now reporting Wei Tianlang of Lenggu Industrial Company under my real name. He deceived his superiors and subordinates, cheated on the compensation for land acquisition and relocation of the tourist resort, involved in crime and evil, and sent his men, Sang Zicheng and others, to demolish houses and dig up graves by violent means. I, Master, we haven't reported to the county police yet. Is it appropriate to come here directly? I've spoken to Captain Lin. He'll be here soon. Captain Lei. Captain Lei. Long time no see. Chen Xiao Xian. Just joined the team. Captain Lin. Hello! He's a great guy. How's it going? Anything new? This was just found under the table. It's got blood on it and it smells like oil. Combined with the traces left by the suspected murder weapon at the scene, we guess that the murderer may have used butchery-type tools. I'll arrange for someone to check it out as soon as possible. There's one more thing. Gu Dahe's sister went to ask Wei Tianlang for him. We need to check it out. Let's go. Wei Tianlang! Hand over my brother. Hand him over! Wei Tianlang, listen to me. It's already happened. You have to give us an explanation. Explanation! Explanation! Explanation! Wei Tianlang, what happened to my KTV girls? Why did they all go to the Liangdian Ballroom? I have nothing to do with Liangdian. Bullshit! Who doesn't know you're in cahoots with that Liangdian bitch Cheng? I'm telling you, you have to send all my girls back. How dare you scold my mom? I'm doing you too much honor, aren't I? Which finger did you just point at me? The scissors! Come on, Pull his fingers apart. This finger? This finger? I give up! Give up! Give up! From now on, your KTV is mine. Let's go in. Wei Tianlang! Hand him over. Wei Tianlang, come out! Wei Tianlang! Let him out! Release him! Let him go! Let him go! I'll say it again. I really don't know where Gu Dahe is. If you don't believe me, go to the police. Don't go. Wei Tianlang. My brother just disappeared after reporting you. Who else could it be if you didn't kidnap him? There are more people who reported me. Wei Tianlang! If anyone wants to be a village hegemon and get involved in gang crimes in our village, I'll put my word down here today as village chief. If there's one of those, I'll deal with one, and if there's a pair, I'll deal with a pair. If you don't believe me, let's try. Okay. Let's try. Let's see what you'll do. Come back! Don't go! Come back! Wei Tianlang is too arrogant! The county allocated RMB 800 million for land acquisition and relocation. With such a big piece of fat meat in his mouth, can he not be arrogant? Who is this person? Tiejun, Wei Tianlang's man. Chief Gu, let me introduce you. This is Lei Yang, vice captain of the Criminal Investigation Division of our city police. Hello, Leader! Hello, Leader! Chief Gu and Gu Dahe are family, right? Yes. The two of us are uncle and nephew. Captain Lin, he's an old friend. I know. A relationship like the one I have with Dahe, that's how it is in the countryside, people are almost always a bit related to each other. That's how he is. Does Chief Gu know about Dahe's real-name report on Wei Tianlang? Yes, I know. After he was beaten, I was the first one to tell him that he have to go to the police. I said it's against the law for them to beat you, you must call the police. But he wouldn't listen to me. What's the result! We can't even find him now! The relocation is such a big deal, apart from Gu Dahe, don't other villagers have any objections? That's impossible. Four other villagers came to me with reporting materials just now. Chief! It's not fair! What should we do? We have to sue. I said this matter ...... Chief, someone set a fire under the bridge at the village entrance. What's going on? Who did this? Who? It's a sin! Captain Lin. Look at this group of people. They're so lawless. Why don't you all say something? Who did this? Don't you dare come forward? Get up! Get up! Come on, come on. The case of grave digging and forced demolition in Lenggu village has attracted widespread public attention. The leaders of the provincial and municipal party committee attached great importance to this case, specifically instructed the city's leading group of crackdown on gang crimes to establish a special task force on the Lenggu village case and arranged for Comrade Lei Yang, the vice captain of the Criminal Investigation Division of our city police, to take full responsibility for investigating and solving the case. The higher-ups asked us find out the truth of the case and the suspected illegal problems of the Lenggu Industrial Company, and to solve the case by using the police in a different place. In addition, given that the victim of the case, namely, the real-name informant, Gu Dahe, is still missing, it is imperative that the main perpetrator of the grave-digging and house-demolition case, namely, Sang Zicheng, must be swiftly apprehended and brought to justice. Follow the trail to the end and close the case expeditiously. Yes. Waiter. Dude, what's up? What's this? No way! I'll get you another bowl of food. Don't give me that shit! No, I won't. I'll get you another bowl of food. I won't charge you either, okay? What? Don't I have any money? I'm in a bad mood. You're making me sick, don't you know that? What do you mean? Give me ten thousand yuan. Ten thousand? It's a small store, bro! I don't make a couple bucks a day. Aren't you blackmailing me? If you do that, I'll just have to call the police. Okey, call the police! Lei, What's wrong with you, Lei? Four or five of them. Are you okay? How are you? Are you hurt? I'm fine. Captain Lin, you're here. Are you all right? Uncle Lei. I'm fine. Why are you back? There's a case here. Do you need to go to the hospital? What for? I'm fine. Are you staying at home this time? If you do, I'll clean up your place. That's not necessary. How's it going? Is it Sang Zicheng? It's a clear shot. It's him. What? You know the guy who smashed the store. That's the suspect we're looking for. Captain Lei. I'm Wei Tianlang. Welcome to Binjiang. What's this for? Wei Tianlang even knows where I live. Oh, my God. Xiaoxian and I should stay at the Anti-crime Office. Okay. Have someone take the evidence to the evidence section. Yes, sir. Captain Lin. These are the slaughtering tools you asked me to find. I forgot to introduce you. This is my apprentice, Guan Ning. She's also my junior female schoolmate. Captain Lei, hello! Hi! Thanks for your hard work. It's okay. This should be it. Follow Captain Lei's lead, investigate slaughterhouses and raw pork outlets throughout the county to identify suspects. Yes, sir. And Sang Zicheng. We must find him quickly. Sang Zicheng has no fixed abode. His greatest hobby is foot massage. Brother Cheng! What are you doing? Master, he's already inside. Eat your noodles. Stay in the car. Sang Zicheng. Things have gotten out of hand. Take the money and get out of dodge. Mr. Cheng. That's all you're giving me! You're so stingy. I'll tell you what. You give me another one million yuan, okay? Why don't you go to hell? Isn't that the bitch? Fuck! I haven't been here for a few days, why are you so strong? Okay, okay, okay. It's almost done. Brother, you can't make it! Why is your hand so hard? Are they calloused? Sis, it's okay. It's done. Almost done. Why are you exerting so much force? You're twisting steel bars? Are you done? What are you doing? Who are you? What do you mean? Where the hell is everybody? Someone fucked me. Boss! Boss! Boss! Boss, are you okay? You're a mess! Beat him up. It's you again, isn't it? Get lost! Where is he? Don't massage. Boss. Hit him. Brother Cheng! Get out of the way. Don't chase him. Can you drive? The police beat people up! Be honest! The beating of Gu Dahe, the demolition, the digging of the grave, you did all that, didn't you? It's all Gu Dahe's fault, nothing to do with me. What about the store smash-up? Listen to me. There really was hair in that dish. This cell phone is yours, isn't it? Cheng Lin! Boss, is this your first time here? What services are available here? Are you looking for a hooker or a salsa dancer? Face to face, belly to belly. If you move a step in half an hour, it's in the lobby. Just tell me which girl you like. It's only ten yuan a song. There are also decks with shows. The minimum spend is eight hundred yuan. There are sexy and hot caged beauties and private rooms. Is Mr. Cheng here? I'd like to talk to her. Boss, do you have an appointment with my sister? No. If you want to play, I can play with you. But if you're looking for a fight, I advise you to ...... Sisters, I'm coming. You're here. It's been a while. Missed you guys. It's been a long time. Honey. Come on, sit down. What are you waiting for? Take off your shirt. These are the most handsome male models in our Liangdian Ballroom. Be enthusiastic! Take care of your sisters. This is my favorite. Sisters! Have fun! Sister Lin! Coming! What's going on? Tongtong. There's a cop here to see you. The sun is setting on my little Mori Little Mori The sea breeze blows her hair Her hair That's good singing! Serve the wine! Officer, hello! I'm Ching Lin, the owner of Liangdian Ballroom. The guy in the picture isn't as handsome as he is in person. I just arrested a guy named Sang Zicheng. Who? Sang Zicheng. Do I know him? He's got a lot of videos and photos on his cell phone. The images are unbearable! Officer Lei, just tell me what you have to say. What? You know Sang Zicheng? I'm here to find out about Wei Tianlang. Mr. Cheng knows him well, right? You're being too hard on me. A big boss like Mr. Wei, how could I possibly know about him? See! This is the police. Shout! Let him save you. Shout! Help! Help! Police! Help me! Hurry up! I'll have a drink with you to cheer you up. Okay. This singing place is too rowdy. Mr. Cheng shouldn't be able to think straight. Why don't you come back to the police station with me? It's quiet there. Captain Lei, I heard you were looking for me. Let's go eat. The sun is setting on my little Mori Little Mori Awful! Little Mori Mr. Wei The guests have arrived. Turn off the music. Just tell me what's going on. There's no need for this. I'm just trying to be a good host! Make friends with Captain Lei. I want to make friends with you too. But the villagers in Lenggu village won't agree, right? You pocketed their demolition money. If I were to befriend you, they'd have to eat me. Don't talk about those unhappy things. Come on, let's eat. This is their specialty, blowfish. Try it. It's poisonous. I won't eat it. The last person who treated me to this was sentenced to 25 years. There's too much blood on this table. Are you reminding me? I came back to Binjiang this time to investigate you. Well, you'll have to look into that. I heard that your father committed suicide because he had a conflict with the villagers in Lenggu. You did this to the villagers for revenge! They forced my father to die. They made a mistake. Why can't I punish them? Two wrongs don't make a right. Don't get yourself into trouble. I paid respect to you. That's because it wasn't your dad who died. I'm telling you, don't think of yourself as a savior. In Binjiang, I'm in charge. It doesn't matter who you are or what status you have. As long as you have done something harmful or broken the law, I will punish you. By the way! The food in our police station is much better than here. I'll treat you next time. Another posture. Take more pictures. Tomorrow, let Lei Yang's father add some luster to Lei Yang. Let go of me. Lei Yang is known as a powerful glue. Once he sets his sights on you, he'll stay glued to you. A shitty cop! Scared? I'm worried about Sang's cell phone. If anything gets into Lei Yang's hands, we'll be in deep shit. What's there to worry about with cell phone? The one who can do me in has yet to be born! Lei Yang. What's this? Wait a minute. Lei. Your father's in the hospital. I'll be right there. Elevator 2, Xingfu Building. I'm going to the hospital now. Lei Yang, go back. Don't stay here. Dad, it's okay. If I'd listened to you and stayed home, you wouldn't have gotten hurt. I'm fine. I was honorably wounded. As long as you finish the case, it's worth it. Uncle Lei. How are you? I'm fine. Sit down, sit down. Lie down. Lie down. Master. Is everything okay? It's okay. Did those two confess? They're stubborn. Captain Lei. There's a problem. What is it? Speak up. Sang Zicheng's cell phone is missing. What? Yan'er. Wei Tianlang is worse than a beast. If you go to him alone, you're in danger. I can't help you. Sorry. Tongtong. Please help me! My brother is the only family I have left. You know my parents died a long time ago. My brother brought me up. He ran that junkyard just for me. He wanted to save more money for my dowry. My brother has always protected me since I was a child. This time, I want to protect him. Do you think this will go away if you apologize? Mr. Wei, please! You should be the bigger person, and forgive him this time. Let my brother go! Stand up. Take off your clothes! Come on. Drink it and play with us for a while. My dear, Can I hurt you? But why do I feel like you just want to hurt me. Your brother videotaped me, you recorded me. There's not a single good person in your family! Come on. Why don't you drink when I tell you to? Drink! Drink! There's no one good. You really don't take me seriously, do you? Come on! Let's make you feel as good as dead. Are you out of your mind? What kind of place is this? How could you do such a thing? I didn't want to kill her. Sang Zicheng's cell phone. Don't make me clean up your mess in the future! I'll delete all the surveillance from the last week. But the leader has just gotten very angry. He said he can't find anyone to take the fall for murder. Take care of it yourself. Is anyone there? Wei Tianlang, you! You shall not end well! Who is it? Sister. Why are you here? It's your birthday next week. I brought you a present in advance. Listen to me. You should quit. What does this mean? Wei Tianlang doesn't know about your sneaky video shooting now. Sister. Sister. Sister. I was wrong. I was wrong. I was too bold. I shouldn't get involved in this. Sister. You're scared now? Where's the cell phone? There's no backup, right? I'll pretend nothing happened. Keep your mouth shut. I got here just after 5:00 this morning. I fished for a while, but didn't catch anything. I saw a big long black bag over there. I thought I'd go over and see what it was. When I opened it, I saw a girl in it. I freaked out. When my cell phone got a signal, I called the police. Look into Gu Yuyan's phone call records and the road surveillance. Yes. Poor kid! Poor kid! Tianlang, listen to mom. Get out of here! Did you hear what someone told you? I told you I'm fine. Besides, what will you do if I leave? I'll stay with your dad. Listen to mom. Okay, okay. I got it. Don't cry. Godfather. I'm here to see you. Tong. Why don't you call the police? Gu Yuyan. Isn't she your classmate? Call the police? You called the police and waited for them to check your positive urine test! Yan'er died too tragically! I wanted to save her, but I was scared. Who is it? Leizi, what's wrong? Who are you? I'll kill you. Help! Help! Help! Help! What's going on? Master. I found out that Gu Yuyan's last call was made to Sun Tong. Hello! 120! I've got a person in need of emergency care. Send an ambulance quickly. Tiejun is wanted in the whole city! Seizure of Lenggu Industrial Company! This girl had been to the ballroom on the day she was killed. The last person she contacted was Sun Tong, the ballroom's forewoman. Just yesterday, Sun Tong was assassinated. Sun Tong is dead? How is that possible? How did she die? And who is this girl? I don't know. Captain Lin. Cheng Lin. According to Article 310 of the Criminal Law, A person who harbors a perpetrator of intentional homicide is recognized as a criminal perpetrator of the very serious crime of harbouring, and in accordance with the law, shall be sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years and not more than ten years. Sang Zicheng confessed. He said a lot about what happened between you and Wei Tianlang. And it's very detailed. There's more good news. Sun Tong isn't dead. I invited you to a big restaurant, but you invited me to a dump. Didn't you say your unit's food was good? Shit! Watch your mouth. No matter how it tastes, you have to eat it, don't you? Cheng Lin and Sun Tong gave an account of what you did at the KTV. You killed Gu Yuyan, didn't you? Don't try to trick me. Tiejun, who kidnapped Gu Dahe and assassinated Sun Tong, was one of your men, right? Sang Zicheng also explained a lot about you. I heard you robbed Boss Niu's KTV. Heard? You cops have to have evidence. Little brat, where's my lawyer? Don't be in such a hurry. Let's take a urine test. Urine. Come on. Paper cup. I'll pee for you now. Come on. I'll pee for you. It's you? Gu Shande. I never thought that you would conspire with Wei Tianlang to screw your own people. You've turned your back on us. You won't even be able to enter your ancestral grave in the future. I'm keeping you here for your own good. What do you mean? You reported Wei Tianlang, Will he spare you? If I don't keep you here, Wei Tianlang will kill you. Do you believe me? Doesn't he dare! You've been beaten up like this. How dare you say that? Hungry? Yes. Brother. What about my sister? She knows I'm here, right? You'd better eat. You... Yan'er is fine. I'm here. Leader! You... I'm going to need you to help him out again. I can't help you with the murder. Isn't he in charge in Binjiang? Let him take care of it himself! Don't be angry with him, sir. If you don't get him out this time, I'm afraid he'll die if this goes on! Wei Tianlang is so lawless now. You're the one who spoiled him. I heard he bought an island abroad. Yes.This kid is out of line. When he gets out of the Anti-crime Office, let him take a vacation on that island to get some air. I understand. I got it,sir. You just can't get past Liu Chunlan. They say I'm an obstacle to the city's development process, authoritarian and domineering, and they're asking me to reflect. This is to clear Wei Tianlang's name! Why are you mad? Resort development involves many departments. They're all facing performance reviews. It's normal to have some opinions. Besides, they're just complaining, not suing. Captain Lin. You're part of this, aren't you? What do you mean? Sang Zicheng's cell phone disappeared into thin air. Then Sun Tong was killed. Who leaked all this information? The county public security bureau's anti-crime office is such a small place. Some people were bought off by them long ago. Wei Tianlang's men have been spying on you. That's true, isn't it? What are you doing? Ghost hunting! Back to work! Back to work! Back to work! Stop it! What are you doing? Do you know what this place is? Folks! These are leaders from the city. If you have any problems, you can talk to them. You can't make trouble here. It's against the law. Understand? Damn it! What are we going to do? Anti-crime Office,Bullshit! Making us lose our livelihood is against us, isn't it? Back off! Back off! Back off! Back off! Back off! Back off! Master! Don't move! Don't move! Don't move! Are you okay? Police murder! Police murder! Police murder! Police murder! Don't you know it yet? In view of the fact that in this incident of defending the rights of migrant workers, Comrade Lei Yang's incompetence and mishandling of the situation have resulted inadverse social impacts, after a study by the leadership of the Municipal Police Department and in accordance with the provisions of the Ministry of Public Security's Public Security Organs on the implementation of measures of suspension from duty and confinement, it is hereby decided to suspend Comrade Lei Yang from the performance of his duties. Where are you going? I'll give you a lift. Sorry, Mr. Wei. We're not on the same route. Don't you dare report me! A car wash! Can't be bothered to dismantle it? I'm not signing. No, no. I'll sign it. I'll sign it. Master. Why did they suspend you? They obviously came here on purpose to cause trouble. Where are you? I'm at the market to buy some fruit for my dad. Come back soon. Master. I saw Tiejun. Don't act rashly. What's up? Don't give me that. Someone's dead. That girl died on my turf. It's all because of you. Yes. I'm the one who owes the debt. Who's going to pay it if I don't? He won't listen to me now. He won't leave when I tell him to. I'm telling you, he'll get us into big trouble sooner or later. He won't. Didn't you see Sun Tong filming us when you deleted the surveillance video? What do you mean? Mr. Wei. I was in a hurry. I didn't have time to look. It took me too long to delete it with one click. Well, I think Tiejun should go out for a while. We'll let him come back when everything is safe. What do you think? Are you afraid he'll betray me? I don't mean that. Dad, what are you doing here? You're worried about your apprentice. I'm worried about my son. People go through more ordeals in life. The more ordeals you go through, the better off you will be. Dad, do you think I can bring Wei Tianlang to justice? You'll definitely be able to. Who is my son? He's a crime-fighting hero! You've taken down so many big potatos. A small potato like Wei Tianlang, it's easy to deal with him. But you have to keep yourself safe. Old comrade, are you all right? I'm fine. I'll hold up. It can now be confirmed that Wei Tianlang was informed of the resort development in advance, and used a series of means, such as buying at a low price, forcibly occupying, fraudulent transfer, etc., to take the villagers' land, forest land and houses for themselves. Wasn't this resort a project started before Vice Governor Guan Dajun retired? Yes. What do you mean? I've been secretly investigating these days. I found out that Sang Zicheng's cell phone was taken to Wei Tianlang by Guan Ning. Guan Ning? Did Guan Ning really do it? Both of them have been bribed. Is Sun Tong's bag with cash in the evidence section? Yes. Take the fingerprints on it. I suspect someone used that money to buy evidence of Wei Tianlang's murder. Don't you suspect me anymore? I've investigated you. Why did you hide it? The job dispatch request has been approved. You're injured. You should take a break. I'm getting old, and not as good as I used to be. There's something wrong with the whole body! But if I step down now, I always feel sorry for the folks in Lenggu village. Catching Wei Tianlang is my last battle. I'll accompany you. Guan Ming, you've let me down. Master, I'm sorry. I can't figure it out. Why the hell did you do it? I can't help it. Wei Tianlang threatened me with my father. Kill Cheng Lin. Officer Lei, what do you want from me? I want to see Sun Tong's locker. I think you've been suspended. At Sun Tong's house, we found a bag containing hundreds of thousands of cashes. This bag has your fingerprints on it. Tiejun, what are you doing? keep running! Guan Ning, it's come to this. I am also responsible. Master, I was reckless before. Congratulations on your reinstatement! Cheng Lin also confessed. Wei Tianlang embezzled compensation for land acquisition and relocation, totaling 580 million. In addition, the matter of the workers storming the Anti-crime Office has been cleared up. It was planned by Guan Dajun. Coupled with the video of Wei Tianlang's murder in Sun Tong's cell phone, the evidence is now overwhelming. We can make an arrest. There's one more person. Did Officer Lei come to see me today for something? Let's split up. The arrest operation begins! Yes! Wei Tian Lang, I told you not to involve my daughter. Why did you let her do those things? Vice Governor Guan. Your daughter knew about us all along. She's not working for me, she's working for you. It's called knowing yourself as well as the enemy to be able to deal with everything easily. Do you want to wait for Guan Ning to arrest you herself and place righteousness above family loyalty? I'm telling you ...... Guan Dajun! What are you doing? This is an arrest warrant. Come with us. Hello? Where are you? Something happened at the walleye pollock processing plant! Get over here!Hurry up! Come on, come on, come on. Give it to me. Take the keys. Drive this car. You're being met at the border, do you hear me? Whatever happens on the road, don't come back. Do you hear me? What about you? Don't worry about me. I'm old. The money has been transferred to your card. Spend the pocket money contained in this bag on the way. Be safe! Gu Shande! Get outta here. Gu Shande, you son of a bitch! Dahe! Dahe! You son of a bitch! Dahe! Dahe! You liar! Dahe! Dahe! Gu Shande! You're actually in cahoots with Wei Tianlang! You're the sinner of our Lenggu village. How could you let the village folks down? Let me explain. Shut up! I just remembered I forgot something. I'll let you go down to your sister now. What did you do to my sister? Your sister is down there with your mom. What are you going to do? Let's go. Don't listen to him. Let go of me! Let go of me! I'll kill you! I...... Wei Tianlang. Your father committed suicide that year because Gu Shande poisoned the fodder your family sold, which killed all the cows and sheep in the village. Gu Dahe! You're lying! I've kept your secret for years. Now, you and this brute have teamed up to harm the people of the village. Do you have a conscience? Don't listen to him. I didn't kill your father. I didn't kill your father. Gu Dahe, you son of a bitch! You're full of shit! Gu Shande! You're the one who killed him. Why don't you listen, listen, listen to me? I have nightmares all the time when I think about him killing himself. I'd be shaking all over. My dad was framed? It doesn't matter if I take more for him. I can resist all adversity! My mom wants me to move. But I won't. I'm gonna make a name for myself here. I want to be somebody. I want justice for my dad. I want to get back everything he lost. I'll take their land. I'll take their houses. I'll take their money. I'll fuck their women. But I really didn't think you got my dad killed. No, I didn't. No, I didn't kill him. Master! Master! Are you alright? I'm fine. You go and catch him. Don't ever let him get away. Move! Don't run! Wei Tianlang! You won't get away this time! Captain Lin, are you okay? I'm fine. You want to die, don't you? I'll help you. Wei Tianlang! Your good times are over. Resign yourself! Am I a resigned man? I said I'll arrest you if you commit a crime. I advise you to kill me today, or I'll kill your whole family. You can think about that if you can get out. Tianlang, it's all Mom's fault. I couldn't protect you. What are you talking about, mom? I'm fine. I just want to eat your dumplings. Tianlang. I don't want to hide things from you anymore. I had you after I was raped by Gu Shande. He is your real father. From the day I married into the Lenggu village, Gu Shande had his eye on me. I was too scared to talk about it and had to hide the fact that he raped me. I'm sorry. Everyone's here. Let's have a drink! Drink! Okay. Wish you all good health! Thank you! I'll take a call. So many delicious dishes! Enjoy yourself. Make yourself at home. Lei Yang. There's a major criminal case in Chunzhou County. Your leave is temporarily canceled. Come back to work quickly! Here you go. Have some more. Okay!
