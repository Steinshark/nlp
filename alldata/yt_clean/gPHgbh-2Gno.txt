- Hi I'm Josh. Are you ok Malachi? I'm fine, I'm fine. He's not doing well. This is just so confusing. That's hot, that's definitely not mild. My tongue is on fire! Have you guys got anymore? - What, Twinkies? Today we're going to be to British school boys. How familiar are you guys with American food? Oh you're kidding me. Good experiences with American food? Yeah, once or twice. I haven't tried many. We eat McDonalds, KFC This is going to taste the same. Look, it's not that different from Have you had any American snacks before? What comes to mind? I think... Hershey's. Too much peanut butter. - Very very very sweet. No, they're nice. I like them. It's like eating a bowl of peanut butter as a whole. No, I like them. Three seconds in and there's shots I'm originally from America. Oh really? You may have tried all of these before. We're gonna start out with some classics. Alright. What is this? So you've never had goldfish before? No... I used to have them as a pet. Go for it. Geez. It tastes like it has onion in it. That's nice. Yeah. That's actually nice. I like these. This is a lot like Mini Cheddars. I'll definitely have Mini Cheddars over these. They actually eat this? What do you mean? No, like people go into a sup and Yeah! Yeah they can go. Get them out of my sight! Alright, not that impressed by the Goldfish. Maybe Cheez-It would be better. I don't like how many z's there are. It's always the Americans innit? Always with the z's. They had to put a 'z' at every possible opportunity, They're all pretty plain, aren't they? I know. They don't taste of anything. They're a bit umm... plain. I genuinely can't taste anything. Which one was better? Definitely those. Goldfish. 100 percent. I'd say I prefer those. Just because there's a bit of... umm but it's a vinegar taste to it, I feel like in this one. It gives an interesting texture, When you say the word 'interesting' there, 'Interesting' is like a really English Next up we have Combos. Combos. Combos. Stuffed snacks. Baked Pretzels. My grandma is Italian, and I feel quite a lot of It shouldn't be called pizza. And again, it has the 'z' in it. Okay, hahaha. There's two z's. Have you ever had Combos before? No, never seen it in my entire life. Never, only sausage rolls. His Italian blood is repelling it. This is just so confusing. That's not real cheese. No way. No way. Aw, no! No! What is this? Do you not like that? I think they love them. Haha, Ollie! Never had something like this before. It's different, right? Mate, that don't taste like pizza. I can taste pizza. Kind of like Domino's. - Basically a pretzel but it's nice. It just.. is. How do you want me to describe pizza? There's like a whole slice but like that big. My mum's watching this. I'm going to swallow it...so. Yeah, my mum always told me You're not going to waste it. Aw, that's disgusting! They violated that snack so hard. We're going to stay on the pizza theme. Pizza flavoured Pringles. That doesn't sound good. They've gone crazy. It's strange to see two very familiar concepts. combined into one thing Is it supposed to taste of pizza or I think that's what it says on the box. But like.. It doesn't taste of pizza. I don't think there's anything like Because it tastes like every other Pringles I've tasted before. If I didn't see it was pizza I would've thought it was BBQ flavour. Okay. Okay. Interesting.. But I think it's slightly better. Yeah. - This is nice. Like if I walked into a shop I could buy them. Next up. Now I don't think Here are Rap Snacks. Oooh! Cardi B! Why is Cardi B on this? Cheddar BBQ Cardi B... Do you know who Cardi B is, Malachi? Cardi B? The Rapper? Do you know Cardi B? Oh, of course I know Cardi... My grandma probably doesn't but... If the food is the same quality as her music then Okay.. Woahhhh! Burn! What, are they just like normal crisps? Basically, a bunch of different rappers And they launched these different Rap Snacks. So these are like Cardi B flavoured? No no... Oh oh.. They taste like a BTEC cheddar cheese. Malachi, why are you using slang? BTEC is not slang... Yes it is... BTEC. What does it stand for? Like a worse.. It means a worse version. You expect them to be like kind of basic and You taste them and there's just so much flavour in your mouth immediately. These are nice. I would actually buy these. I mean, probably not one that says Cardi B on it, but yeah, that just puts me off. Yeah, no way. No way. Cardi B tastes weird. I mean I guess they are artificial Being successful in life and in music. Business is all about being true to who you are. Knowing your self-worth, never sweating the small things and always following your gut's instincts. If you follow this, There's no way Cardi B said that. That is so fake. Continue on the crisps theme... Takis. Let's go. Yes. Do you know Takis? - Yes! - I've heard rumours about these. What are the rumours you've heard? They're hot. Oh dear... Yeah, definitely artificially flavoured. These are red! What?! Oh my days! Wh... Wow. - You didn't know they looked like that? I'm fine. Yeah? Yeah I'm fine.. Ooooh man. It's like being kicked in the mouth. Really? They're too spicy for crisps. Mmm! I'm fine with spicy food. That's like.. Chicken wings. Spicy. It's not too bad! It's not that bad. I'm proud of myself. How do you feel about that? I actually really like it but it's got a lot of flavour to it. Yeah it's a very intense flavouring. It tastes great but I don't think I could eat more than 3. Next up we have.. Carolina Reaper flavoured. Extra hot. That's intimidating. You barely survived the last one. Malachi, are you sure you wanna have this? Pass the water. It smells like danger. Smell it. I guarantee these are not as spicy as those. Ohh you took like half of it in one bite! It's not that bad.. No it's not. Just wait. Just wait. Give it a couple seconds. No it's.. it's pretty bad.. It's pretty bad. I'm waiting for it to kick in but it's not. Boy, you're tempting fate! It's fine though! It's not even spicy.. Come on now. Hmm. Hahahahaha! Are you ok, Malachi? I'm fine, I'm fine. Alright, Dan, where would you put them on a Nando's ring? It's, like, underneath medium. I'm feeling it now. Hahahahaha! Ooh! Whoa! That's hot, that's definitely not mild! You've outed them of water. My tongue is on fire! Well, time to give you guys This is an American classic. A and W root beer. Root beer? Yeah. Oh.. You've had root beer before? I've had root beer before, it's awful. This is one of the few things I miss from the US. Wow. It's nice. That's disgusting. Hahahahaha! Kind of tastes like good tasting medicine in a way. Yeah hahahaha! It tastes like, em, mouthwash. Yeah. It actually does. That is exactly You can do it with ice cream as well, you just take I'd choose this in a shop, for sure. But why would you drink that for pleasure? You don't actually enjoy mouthwash. I think I'd rather rip my tongue out. It's better than nothing. Hahahahahaha! That's the most British conclusion ever. The water was nice. Next up, we have another American classic. Twinkies. This is what you think of Golden sponge cake with creamy filling. I can already hear peak American people in the comments. 'Listen to how they talk, 'creamy filling', This is like one of those French, Like.. an eclair! Yeah, like an eclair. Oh, it's got cream in it. Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Mmm. Nice. It's quite good. Yeah, they should sell these here, definitely. Really? Ok. A British person saying &quot;quite good&quot;, These are really nice. I like it. I mean, it's kind of plain. No, it's nice! It really is. It's like brioche. Brioche? Are you mad? No. Like, the first bite is nice but I think You can just taste that, You know the things that Wow. Look at those, gone. Gone. So quick. Have you guys got any more? What, Twinkies? For later, for later. Yeah, you can keep that. - Next up, we have... Yeah, I know you did, What we have next is probably Warheads. Warheads, extreme sour, yay... Are sour sweets like a thing in England? Yes, and I hate them. Ok hahahahaha. I love them, I love them. I'm really not looking forward to this. Whoo. Oh, no! Mm. Keep on going, it gets sweeter. No, that is weird. Hahahahahahahaha What the hell? He's not doing well. You alright? You ok? You can spit it out if you want, Yeah. Good man, it looked like your body was rejecting that. Oh hahahahahahaha Oh my god, this is bad. Have you ever seen anything No. Maybe like a hairspray or something. Ready? 2 ,1. That's nice. It's nice, it's entertaining. How is a sour spray 'entertaining'? Well, there's something extremely satisfying about You get, like, a kick of flavour. It keeps missing my mouth though. Ooooh woah, sorry. Seems counterproductive. You buy a sweet to enjoy it. And you buy, like, the least enjoyable sensation. I love this, I love this. I really like this though, cause with these ones But with these ones you can keep refreshing it. Final one, some American chocolate. Oh yess! I have mixed feelings about Hershey's. I think Dairy Milk is a lot better actually. My chocolate standards are quite high, I must admit. Tastes like chocolate? Tastes like chocolate. Pretty average. Tastes like M&amp;Ms, it's the same kind of taste. It's like M&amp;Ms chocolate. Why is that one so crunchy? He's getting through the sour sweet. You know when you have Christmas chocolates or something and then they sort of go off, cos no one's eaten them Ohhh, you're right. It tastes like hot chocolate, actually. Exactly, exactly. It tastes like hot chocolate. I like it, to be quite honest. It's like the mixture of Galaxy and Dairy Milk. I'm a big fan actually. I wouldn't have it again. It's good, but it's not the best. So American snacks, guys, what do you think? I like the spicy crisps and stuff, - The Twinkies. Twinkies are the best? I think whoever came up with the Combos... I must say I'm a bit disappointed by the Twinkies. Like I was really looking forward to my first Twinkie And we've got it on camera, And then I have my Twinkie Disappointed in Twinkies. I just don't think they've quite grasped the essence I'm a big fan of the water as well. That's the level we're on. Do you have a video of Americans try British snacks? We probably should. Because I think they'd be like Americans. Your food is good. I like it. Yeah, it's quite nice. It's quite good. Twinkies! I congratulate you for that If you are American and you see this video. They are not substantially better, I don't know how you put up with this every day. Alright, thanks very much guys. No problem. Thank you very much. I hope you guys enjoyed that. In the meantime. We'll see JOLLY you soon. See you later!
