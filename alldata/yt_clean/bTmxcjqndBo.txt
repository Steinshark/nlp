During the reign of Emperor Jiajing in the Ming Dynasty Yan Song and his son Yan Shifan controlled the court with their cunning schemes As their power games spread from the capital to various regions Jiangnan fell under the control of Japanese pirates The Japanese threat escalated urgent calls for help echoed across thousands of miles of maritime borders.

No need Our mission is accomplished We should not find trouble. Spread my word! Let's go back to the Double Island. All right. Dad! Dad! Where are you? Dad! Where are you? Let me down! Let me down! Let me go! Let me down! Let me go! Let me down! Let go! Let me go! Let me down! Come! Come down! Come down! Kid! No! Come down! Be good! Are you trying to disobey me? Be quick! Kid! Be good! Come down! Come! I don't want to become a monk! Come! Dad! Go! -Don't cry! -Mom! Don't cry! Did your parents send you here to get disciplined because you were too naughty at home? My parents are dead Dead? How? The clothes are torn! Ugly! I don't want to wear that I want to wear beautiful clothes Look at this! I bet you don't have one! What is that? My mom gave it to me Yuekong, change into these clothes Then you would know what you should do What you shouldn't do When you know everything then you can go back to your mother Really? Then I'll change When I'm back home there will still be many beautiful clothes for me Master, Yuekong is my name His name is Yuewen It doesn't matter. I'll be home in a few days My name will be Xiaofu again You can use Yuewen as your name then A name is just a name My name is Big Foot Monk. Look! Are my feet very big? How about a man and a wolf? If you call a man a wolf, and a wolf a man, does it make them any different? No. What is a man... who looks like a man... but has the heart of a wolf? Is he still a man? No, he is a beast. That's why the name is not important. It's the heart that's important. The Jap pirates have hearts of beasts. I will kill these monstrous pirates to avenge my parents Why all this hatred? Because of the pirates Because of your heart. The heart is the biggest liar. People can fool you for a short while. Your heart can fool you forever. You better begin your Zen meditation. Master, what is Zen meditation? Zen meditation. It means... No matter what kind of heart one has, a human heart or a wolf's heart, in the end, they will have a true heart Today I will share the story of the Second Patriarch, Huike, finding peace of mind Back then, Huike went to visit Master Bodhidharma Bodhidharma sat facing the wall in meditation, while Huike waited outside That day, snow was falling heavily Huike didn't move a single step even when the snow reached his ankles. Bohdi Dharma smiled and said to him. I have already calm your heart for you Give me your heart! I'll do it for you. Go out! Both of you. I won't eat today My sweat is in the bowl. It's too dirty. I can't eat it. Yuekong, am I meat? We have meat. If I fell inside... then you make a dish out of me. Then all of the monks ate me. They would have broken the rules. Yuewen, are you all right? Yuewen. Yuewen. All right? It's no fun here. I wonder... when will my mom come and get me. Is your mom coming? Of course she is. You have to treat me nicely. When you grow up and you don't want to be a monk then you can come to me. I can give you a ride on my carriage I will give you pretty clothes. I don't want to be on a carriage I don't want pretty clothes. I only want to avenge my parents. Be gentle If you come to me... you will get your revenge for sure Slowly All right. Go. Yuewen. How are you? Yuewen. What are you doing? I want to start a fight. Who treated you badly? You. What are the two of you doing? Stop fighting. Get up. Do you know what have you done wrong? Did I violate the wrath rule? How about you? My heart is not calm. Go to the Dharma hole to meditate. When your heart is calm, then you won't violate again. My mom... didn't even send a letter to me. Today is my birthday. In the past, she would boil two eggs... and make some noodles for me. But now, my parents don't want me anymore. at least, you still have parents to miss But I don't. Do you think my parents would miss me? I guess so. Then why don't they come to visit me? Are you meditating? Master! You have to keep calm. Master, let me ask you... if I am a bodhi tree, then what is my heart? Be a bodhi tree, with a clear heart. Clean to keep away from the dust. Right. Master Xiaoshan said that... if we don't understand these sentences, we cannot go home. What do these sentences mean? If I eat, would you be full? Each person eats to be full. Each person meditates to understand. You need to meditate... to understand on your own. Master, please help us. I beg you. Yuekong. Be quick. Master, please help us. I beg you. Master, help us. Master! Master! Master! Master! Master! It's weird. It seems that Master doesn't want to eat. Why? Why? It's simple. To lose weight. Master! We're here to bring rice to you. Master! Master! Today, there are 15 moves. One more than before. And there is one more set of practice. Look closely. Master! Why can you move better... and faster than us? It's the same set of moves anyway. Where is my meal? Master, please sit down. Master, please eat. Master. Please tell us your secret. I promise I won't tell anyone else Let him eat. Master is being so stingy. Yuewen Tell him the secret again. Hey! Master Yuewen is my name. He is Yuekong. Shaolin look for the unison of body and soul. The unison of movement and stillness. Movement is important, but stillness is even more important. Even if the body can move rapidly, the soul should remain unshaken. If there is unison in body and soul, then movement and stillness can be achieved. All right. I understand. When we are practicing martial arts, we should keep on Zen meditation That's something I already know But Zen meditation... is so boring. Master, what I mean is... do you have other secrets? Enlighten the mind and perceive one's true nature. It's just the same. &quot;Enlighten the mind and perceive one's true nature.&quot; Then everything will be sorted out. Human and nature will become one. However... where is the gist of Zen meditation? Master, why can't I find it? It's everywhere. Who is it? It's me. Who is &quot;me&quot;? No one is &quot;me&quot;. I am nobody. Abbot! Senior brother Abbot What abbot? I'm always Xiaoshan in front of you, my senior brother Abbot. Master Excuse us. We'll go back to the temple then Go if you must Am I too harsh on them? No. How can Yuewen forget about getting revenge? That one is Yuekong. Someday... they will understand who am &quot;I&quot;? At that time... then they can understand their true nature. As long as they understand themselves, then they will be calm. Yes. They have good nature. Yuekong has nearly... forgotten about his hatred. It's Yuewen... It seems he hasn't finished his worldly affairs yet When time comes, everything will be sorted out. Bring them out. General! The Japanese pirates have taken hostage! Cowards! You are all cowards! I know nothing about the art of war But I know that soldiers are meant to protect the people Kill! Archers, get ready. They are not civilians at all Don't let them loose, not a single one Yes. Why you again? Qi Jiguang. Apart from killing civilians, what else can you do? They are the guides to the pirates. They are civilians captured by the Japanese pirates. But they stand by the Japanese pirates. I will not protect... civilians like this. This is just your excuse If your family stand among them, would you do it? If one of them is family, I would still do it. Jinke, come and tell her... how many of our soldiers are dead or injured? In this battle, we have 74 injured soldiers. And we lost over 100 lives, including one superior. Did you hear that? If it's not because of the so-called refugees, would these soldiers got killed? Let me tell you once more. Don't mess with us. Or else... You want to say that you will kill me, right? Qi Jiguang, being such a powerful general with great name but doesn't even dare to say he'll kill me. Go away. Don't think that... I would appreciate your goodwill. General I think that this girl is quite complicated All these years... she followed us through all the battles. Is she a spy? She is not a spy. She is only trying to find her father. Dad! Even if she is not a spy... She always causes trouble every time there's a battle General, you are being to kind to her Perhaps I owe her Let's go take a look at the terrain of the battlefield Find out how to kill the Jap pirates all at once Then it will be peaceful again. Master! There is an invitation. There is a sacrificial ceremony to the sea in the third month. You are invited. Sea Sacrificial Ceremony? It says that they will uplift the ban at sea. That's good. Hope they can use this chance to solve the problem of the pirates. Then who would you bring? I will go with Yuekong. All right. I'll tell him to prepare for it. Homesick? I heard some senior brothers say that there are Japanese pirates everywhere in Zhejiang now Not long ago, they even attacked Nanjing Even Nanjing was plundered, Huizhou won't be safe either. You know, Huizhou is my home. I wonder what happened to my family. I have to leave Shaolin. I wanna go back and see my mom and dad. Don't you want to leave? Don't you want to avenge your parents? Avenge? For what? Where is my hatred? Did you forget about it? Your parents were killed by the Japanese pirates. There was hatred in my heart before. But now it's gone. Stop the nonsense! Yuekong, have you forgotten? Why did you become a monk in the first place? Did you forget the reason why... your parents brought you to the temple? I have not forgotten but I'm just an ordinary person, and I still can't help but miss them I don't know if my parents are safe. Then I cannot be calmed. I don't understand Does doing Zen, reciting Buddha's lectures really make your heart calm? You're right. I cannot be calmed But I have to try to keep a peace of mind. Do you really want to see me suffer every day? Now, I really want to know how my parents really are. -Brothers, let's set up an ambush here. -Understood! General, this area belongs to Zhejiang. If we are going to fight with the Japanese pirates here, should we notify General Zhang beforehand? If we wait for permission from General Zhang, and General Zhang report to the Ministry of Military the pirates would have already escaped to the sea But if we don't have the official approval then it would be a capital crime for us to launch a fight I, Qi Jiguang, chase and kill Japanese pirates What crime is there? -Jinke! - Yes! Take action according to the plan. -Understood! -Follow me! Listen carefully. The Japanese pirates agressed our land, killed our people. Once step on the battlefield everyone has to be brave to fight Whoever backs away will be decapitated Yes. Prepare to attack! Slow down! Wan Biao...? It's Lord Wan from goverment of Zhejiang. Qi Jiguang. How dare you? Lord Wan I'm in the middle of the fight against the Japanese pirates. I apologize for my rudeness. You brought your soldiers in my area without any permission I could have forgive you. But I didn't expect that you are so ignorant and rude. Take him down! Wait! General! Qi, do you want to rebel? Lord Wan! I was fighting the Japanese pirates. Why would I want to rebel? I am in charge of this area, including resisting the pirates You don't have to worry. Take him down! Lord Wan! My soldiers are fighting the Japanese pirates. Please let me fight first, then I'll apologize to you. General! Lord Wan! Who dares to stop me... will be trailed as guilty as Qi! Take him. Waiter! Fetch some tea! Coming! Abbot! Let me pour some tea for you. Go settle the bill -Waiter, give me the bill please. - Sure Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Just two monks left, and now another one comes? Master, do you want some tea? No, thanks. May I ask you where is the way to Huizhou? This is Huizhou. It's not far from the city. Thank you. Mom! Dad! Mom! Dad! Who is it? Grandpa Zhou! You are... I am Xiaofu! I am the son of Zhou Zhiyuan! Xiaofu! You have grown so much! Yes, grandpa. Where is my mom and dad? These are my letters to my mom! I kept all these letters. Where are they? How are they doing? Were they killed by the Japanese pirates? Grandpa! Tell me! They moved away. When did they move away? 15 years ago. When they sent me to the temple? Why did they move away? Don't you understand? They don't want to see you anymore. Mom! Dad! You are so ruthless! Why? Why do you treat me like this? Dad! I am your child! Why? Why? Why? Qi Jiguang! You disregard military law, leading troops to trespass into Zhejiang You have commited a felony by turning into a warlord to seize personal dominions You are now sentenced to death!
