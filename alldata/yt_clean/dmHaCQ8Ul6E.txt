[Music from the vintage Tetris game] [Marc] So today, a little bit of an unboxing, because we got Santa Claus [Marcel] Okay. So, if you are really wondering where you are, and you can't [Marc] This is my favorite Hello and welcome back. If you follow the a jet fighter computer from the 1950s that was computer in a spaceship, and keep flying it this "Space Navigation Indicator", colloquially It started life in slightly simpler form in put Yuri Gagarin in orbit. Then, this upgraded control panels. You can see it in the panel of the Here it is also paired with a mechanical And, it is still on the panel And then, still on the Soyuz TM. It's now paired in a previous episode. And yes, that's the Soyuz computer! Until 2002! This is somewhat mind chips when proletarian gears will do, and I [Marcel] This is Soyuz T or TM, so So, 80s and up. So same kind of era as this is a beautiful instrument that's supposed you're flying around in your Soyuz capsule. And to communicate with the ground as you're passing can switch it into, that shows where you might [Marc] Can you turn the globe with the knobs? [Marcel] I haven't tried that yet. [Marc] Try the big one there, yes. Oh, you wind it up. [Marcel] Yeah it's gonna need to get kind of set. [Marc] Look at the back, I think it Uh, no, it's a different plug. [Ken] A few dents though. [Marc] It has more stuff. [Marcel] This one's been [Marc] I thought it would have the exact but it looks like it has more pins. [Ken] Oh, but there's more happening. [Marc] It's all full of gears inside, isn't it? [Marcel] Yeah. [Marc] It's an analog computer. [Marcel] Just open it for the first time. [Marc] Oh, it maybe the big dent. Can [Marcel] There is one there, one there. [Marc] So, this one has had a tough life. And it's not coming apart despite us it's held right here. This appears This is blown up, so this is a stamp of some kind. So there's no serviceable [Marcel] It's gonna avoid the warranty. [Ken] We're gonna show it's [Marc] All right (laughter) [Marcel] Tamper evident! [Marc] Okay. It came right off. Comrade, you did it! [Marcel] Someone tells me if it's supposed [Marc] Oh something fell. [Ken] Oh, look at that! [Marc] Oh, it has electronics in it. I thought it was only gears. [Ken] This is the newer one. [Marcel] This is the Soyuz T kind of era. [Ken] It looks like it has [Marc] This is a beauty! [Ken] And a cardioid cam here. [Marc] So there is an analog computer This looks so fragile. [Mike] But it looks like it [Marc] Yeah, yeah. You can un-dent [Ken] It seems to have the Ukrainian flag here. [Marc] Yeah. That is just stupendous. We found why our globe is not moving, because is not in the middle - oh, wait I am not [Ken] Can we re-lodge it? [Marc] Absolutely, it's [Marcel] How hard could it be? [Mike] Looks like it kind of [Marc] And on the other side Let's see if there is a simple way [Marcel] I think these four screws. [Marc] Right. So, we definitely confirmed with our out of position with the shaft bearing. By the way this endoscope, sponsored by the a useful instrument. You can dive in gears inside this mechanism. This is a clip I'm trying to look for the end of the globe quite successful this first time around, but Here, I am trying to make my way in from another right there. Aha! I think I made it through. to the brass gear is where the shaft that holds We'll have to talk more about it in another in question. It has two cameras, one that looks to the side. You can even have the two camera attachements, such as an end hook and a magnet, Never happens to me of course. And here is one readings of components from really close up. So the problem is, let's see if we can strategically [Marcel] It looks like there is some [Marc] Yeah. Okay, hold on, hold on. Before Because I could see it. Yeah, you released You got it! [Marcel] So, it's not going to come [Marc] Yeah, yeah! [Marcel] Now this stuff, it's a [Marc] Well, but it's only the [Marcel] This is a weighted thing. [Marc] So, the globe is and that was enough. But we could It has those little gears [Mike] Yeah look at that, that's awesome! [Marc] It's incredible! [Mike] It's so cool! [Marcel] Those are numbers for the stations. [Mike] Oh yeah, there's a [Marc] Wow! And they are the, interestingly, [Ken] I saw Ascension Island. [Marc] So, is that... [Ken] ...Bermuda, Newfoundland. [Marc] Wow, you're pretty good. Yeah, Bermuda. So, I wonder if it's a Soyuz from it could have been Mir or something like that? [Marcel] Yeah, this was [Marc] Since we had the globe out, see more NASA tracking stations marked on ACN is the Ascension Island station, both But then, Master Ken got at close look we could see HAW for Hawaii, GDS for Goldstone all tracking stations for the Apollo flights. the southern Pacific, Ken spotted a red dot marked The Vanguard was a World War II oil a missile tracking station in 1964. More famously, she supported the Apollo and Skylab programs. the space program was the 1975 Apollo - Soyuz This was the last Apollo flight, where an ushering a new era of collaboration, which And guess where the Vanguard ship was stationed find that out: 25 deg S and 155 deg W. And sure if you take into account that 115 degree West very likely, this Globus was either flown mission. A bit broken for sure, but But while we are on the globe subject, at an angle of 51.8 degrees in this case. orbit of the flight, or it will be useless. a different globe, with a different For more on this, I'll link Ken's blog article But for now, we'd really want to [Marcel] We can clean the glass on the inside. [Marc] You sure can! Okay, so it just has to took a beating, which is a problem. I probably Okay, we put the globe back in! And I Other direction. There you go. It doesn't want to orbit anymore. [Mike] Turn that back the other [Marc] Ah dang, I want to demonstrate orbit! Okay, we fixed our problem, which was just a piece [Mike] So, is the top one And the one on the side is latitude? [Marc] Uh, well, it looks like we have this [Mike] The top one is very wrong, yeah. [Marc] Yeah, because we have to retime it. [Mike] Yeah. [Marc] There should be an adjustment for that, the coarse adjustment over here Alright, it seems that deburring the minus the longitude indication that But the rejoicing was tempered [Marcel] Oh watch those wires, [Marc] Ooh! No, they are all cut. Somebody cut your wires! [Marcel] Demil'ed. [Marc] This has been demil'ed, yep. Something this is not connected to anything. connectors, they are not connected to anything. That's very annoying. So, we found where the wires were supposed to go. they just lifted the plate and disconnected what comes here comes out here, and then it went here, all the wires there. And they a cut a few So, decommissioned? What do you think, Marcel? [Marcel] Sabotage? [Marc] This is so weird! [Marcel] I think because it was damaged, with the and no one should attempt to use it. sure it never gets attempted to use, but still [Marc] Yeah, and they closed it [Marcel] It was sealed it up again. [Marc] That's really weird. [Marcel] But the good news, is we're [Marc] And it works! I can probe the thingy, everything does what it's supposed So, I've played with the Globus a little bit. this is your longitude, as indicated here. This latitude and longitude as indicated here. And and we are on an orbit. And we are going to go So, somehow, this doesn't rotate the earth should have rotated from under us. So that's In flight, the mechanism is probably in a manner similar to the Soyuz And that should be - if they haven't changed [Ken] Oh, look at this variable resistor here! [Marc] So, that's the clock. [Marcel] This is CPR. [Marc] Yeah. This was the Soyuz clock we revived Ken's research points to one second But we don't know yet for sure, we So, two beats per second, and it will get going. But there should be a way to Over here this is to adjust the length of your you can adjust the main minutes. And then and the one hundreds of a minute. So these are And what that does is, it changes the height pinion. This weird comical thingy over here. See if I can focus on it. Yeah, this And if I get this cam, you see that cam over And this thing rides on this shaft, it goes on a differential, and there subtract or add a little bit And Master Ken came to the same conclusion, and correction via a differential gear and a mechanism from backing up once the cam resets at operated by a second solenoid we spotted at the And down her, that's the orbit counter. So let All right, and then I'll go once around the Earth. And 90 minutes later, I'm This is interesting. This has to do with landing angle. The ground will tell you what difference between the point where you are And when you put it in one of those you where you're going to land. And, So the landing point indication is by the two brown microswitches that you see landing angle set on the front panel. A DC motor triggers the second microswitch. And then it it goes in the other direction and So, that leaves this dial here, which is a It has a dial within a dial, We later found out from the manual that which tells you in which part of sunlight. The dial itself is very easy to with two rings sliding into each other. This And here, there is an indicator. And I think your landing zone. Or something like that, or And here, I think this must be an essence. Maybe it starts to retro There is also this prominent wire-wound This transmits your current position to other right, you can see one of the cams that they use calculating the longitude and the latitude. And that's it for the tour of the amazing trying to makes sense of the cut wires mess. to rewire it and try to make it work again! Well,
