Great! [Produced by: Guo Wei, Yin Shuai.] [Produced by: Li Xiao, Xiao Xiao, Xu Dan, Wang Tong.] Whoa! [Screenplay by: Xie Dafu, Liu Yase.] Dad! Ease off on me! Are you trying to sneak off before remembering the Rules? No disputes, no troubles! That's right, no disputes or troubles. [Starring: Norman Chui, Sun Jiaolong, Chen Zhihui, Bai Narisu, Su Yue.] Are you my real dad or not? [Directed by: Liu Yase.] Get out of the way! Move! Move! What are you looking at? Piss off! Talking to you! Move! Are you comfortable, master? Get out of the way! Yeah. Get out of the way! Piss off! Move! Get out of the way! Master, master. This is really refreshing! Of course! My whole body felt the cool air after you opened your mouth. Come on! Master Lei, come on! Are you getting shy on me? Let's go! Little lady! What is your name? Where is your home? Come to my house for some drink tonight. Great! Yes! Great! Wow! Support us if you've got some spare change, if you don't, just cheer for us! Thank you, guys! Hey, young mister. Not only are you a handsome guy, you are also generous. What an eye-opening experience. Yes! How is this generous? Master Lei. Thank you for your support. But this is too much money. We cannot take it. This money isn't all for your performance. This is also to buy this girl. What? Are you deaf? Did you not understand? The money is yours. The girl will be ours. Come on. Piss off! This is blatant human trafficking! Are there any laws in this place? Law? I am the law of Hangzhou! Get outta here! Dad! Why are you assaulting us? How could you do this? Run! Let's go. Dad! Go get 'em! Who are you? This is Fang Shiyu from the Shaolin Sect. [New Fong Sai-Yuk: The Battle of the Cliff City] Lei House Musketeers are coming! Run! Are you afraid of heights? I'm afraid of water! Run! Why did you stop running? Mrs Lei. It is your husband who tried to force me. And he killed my dad. He kind of deserved it. How dare you! You showed us Lei House no respect in Hangzhou City. Mrs Lei, no debts went without creditors, no hatred went without cause. Yes. But you have to know, he is the one who hurt your husband. Yes! If you have to kill someone, kill him! What? You both have to die. Mrs Lei! Please don't! I'll give you all the money I have on me. I do whatever you want, whatever you told me to. Jump! I would rather die than jump! I would rather be killed by those guns! Where is he? I thought he wasn't going to jump. Ah! Mom! Whoa! Sugar-coated haws! Shiyu! Shiyu! Cuihua, are you done? Stop crying, it's useless. Your son's already dead. Your son's dead! Why are you throwing a funeral when there's no body to be found? What are you thinking? Fang De! I, Miao Cuihua, swear, I will no longer be a part of this family! Let's never see each other again! Don't be mad, Mrs Miao. It's not good for your health. Yes, Mrs Miao. Master Fang! Milady, those words were a little bit harsh. What? Were they? Yeah. Were they? Yeah. Oops. Keep crying, don't stop. Xiaoyu, Meiyu, what's really going on? This is a letter from Shiyu. They were acting. Our brother is fine. But he's afraid of getting us in trouble. He's running a clothes store in Cliff City now, with a fake name. Li Xiaohuan had her lackeys spying outside our house. So dad and auntie came up with this idea. When this blows over, we'll get Shiyu back. Yeah. Hurry up, keep crying! Cry! Now! Brother Shiyu! My poor son! I didn't give you a happy childhood when you were little. I soaked you in medicines! You are not a drug! Milady, milady. Milady... What? Your acting is over the top. I cannot relate to it! Can you take my feelings into account? Shiyu! If I didn't kick you off the wagon in Hangzhou City, it wouldn't come to this! I'll cut off my legs today! My son! [Cliff City] [Horse Sharing] Okay. Fresh vegetables! Hello? A hundred grams of shochu and a pair of chicken legs for Xiaogang Blacksmith Shop. Be quick. Hello? Four bottles of ice tea and one serving of steamed cold noodle for Beauty Flower Shop. One serving of braised fish for No. 72 Pawn Shop. Five barrel chicken and four roasted goose for Thousand Blossoms. A roasted goose and five hundred grams of Huadiao wine for Abao Clothing. Two thousand grams of steamed dumplings for Mainland Food. Ride with the wind, free your legs! Three coins will get you everywhere! Wait a second. [Wind Rides] We wanted to go to the Maple Woods Hotel in the countryside. Eight coins! Hurry up! What's the hurry? [Abao Customized Clothing] Sorry for the wait. Thank you. These are our latest styles that's just come out today. Thank you. We Abao Clothing will never make same clothes twice. Take your time. You can come to the counter to register once you picked out your favorite. I want the &quot;Cry for the Moon&quot; one. You got it! Have at it. This is your serial number. Take your measurements over there. You can have your order fifteen days later, don't forget your serial number. Next. Remember to pick up your order fifteen days later. Okay. Thank you. Miss Song. Measure my waist first. Okay. Waist first. Miss Song. You don't have to take measurements. Did you forget? You applied for a membership card with your mother at our store. We've got your measurements in our records. We can just look it up. That was a long time ago. Yeah, that was a long time ago. I've lost a lot of weight these days. Of course. You've gotten slimmer. So I have to take your measurements again. Come here. What the hell are you doing? How did you have the time to chit-chat? We are packed today. I wasn't chit-chatting. I was talking to the boss lady about this restaurant's future five-year-plan. Get outta here. Move over! Piss off! Move over! Move over! Move over! Young people these days are getting lazier. With what you are paying him, how could he not? Are you taking his side? Cut the crap from now on. [Jinfuzhuang Restaurant] Mr Five! We saved you some premium potted pork and Bamboo-Green wine. Please. Mr Five. You need to pay business fee, sanitary fee, killing-of-the-animals fee, and foul-smelling fee for your restaurant. You also need to hand in the conjugal fee for yourself. Ten fees all included, fifteen taels of silver in total. What... No... I mean, Mr Five, I didn't do any conjugal stuff. No? Then why did someone hear really loud woman's voice coming from your house? There is no way. Mr Five. You mustn't believe their devious words. There is no way! It's just... not possible. Are you getting embarrassed? You can just keep your voice down from now on. Mr Five. Sidebar, please? Mr Five, I've been a eunuch ever since I was little. I was thrown out of the palace because I offended someone. Yeah? It's real! I'm being completely honest with you. You... Do you not believe me? Watch for yourself! Oh my god, put it on. Fine, fine. I'll spare you the conjugal fee. Only the supplement fees. Ten taels of silver in total. Mr Five...! What? Are you not paying? You have to, you know. Sure, sure. Please wait for a moment. This Duan Five's always riding around on his little scooter. I want to beat him so bad. Fang Shiyu. I'm warning you now, you are a wanted man now. Stay in your lanes. No disputes or troubles. Hey! Why are you using my family rules against me? If I, Fang Shiyu, didn't... Fang Shiyu who? Your name is Miao Abao. Mr Five, you're here! Hello, Mr Five! Quite a feast. It seems you've earned a lot. No, no. This is all thanks to you, Mr Five. Come on. Let's eat together. Whoa. Brother Abao, are you unwilling? Mr Five, Mr Five! Oops, Mr Five. Are you okay, Mr Five? Get off me! Do you wanna die? Give me that. Mr Five. You guys... You need to pay business fee, sanitary fee, measurement fee, queuing-on-the-street fee. On top of that, malicious-assault-of-an-officer-of-the-law fee. Also, you are living together illegally, it's in bad taste. You have to pay for that monthly. Fifteen fees, twenty-seven taels of silver in total. Hey, come on. Mr Five. I have to explain. We are only business partners, we are not living together. Staying at the same place in broad daylight is not living together. Miss Qiu. It doesn't matter if it's day time or night time. As long as you are not married, it's still legal. What if we are married? I don't do marriage. I didn't say I'm marrying you. Why are you looking at me? Are you marrying me? Pay your bills! I have more places to be! Mr Five, here is the money. Miss Qiu Ming. Brother Xiao! What's happening here? Mr Duan Five is here. Brother Xiao. Deputy. What brings you here? We are here for an order. Mr Five. You are...? Routine business. This world is horrible. Even a guy like him gets to be a bully around town. Right, Miss Qiu Ming. This is an order from the Dong House in Wuxi, have a look. Okay, brother Xiao. Deputy. You have to take care of this Duan Five. He knows nothing but mooching off civilians. Brother Abao. It's not that we don't want to. Yeah. Duan Five is nothing but a donkey in a lion's hide. If he didn't have that bandit from the White Tiger Gang, Zhang Jinhong, behind his back, no one would listen to him. The people are not afraid of him, it's whoever's behind him. Zhang Jinhong. Who is that? Why would a squad who provides security be afraid of him? Not afraid. We've just been careful about not stepping on each other's toes. [White Tiger Gang] Great! Master Hong. Master Hong. What is it? Is something bothering you? My good buddy, Lei Laohu, was seriously injured by one of the Ten Tigers of the Shaolin Sect, Fang Shiyu on the street last month. He's still in a coma. Master Lei is quite a figure in Hangzhou City. Who is this Fang Shiyu? How dare he to hurt Master Lei? I don't care about his injuries. It's the waterway transportation I'm worried about. Mrs Lei, Li Xiaohuan gave the access to someone else. It cost me a lot. Master Hong. I've added some more fees to collect. We've earned quite a lot. You don't have to be worried about that cost. Wow! Come on, dance! Great! Beautiful! Master Hong. To celebrate your 40th birthday, I prepared this just for you. Have a look. Where is it? Master Hong! It's here! Amazing! Pretty! Master Zhang, Mr Five bought this luminous pearl just for you from Capital City to celebrate your birthday. This is a good-looking girl. Master Hong. She owns the Abao Customized Clothing. Her name is Qiu Ming. I invited her here to perform, just for you. Give this lady ten taels of gold. Thank you, Master Zhang. How generous! Of course, it's our boss! Master Hong. I bought this luminous pearl. Great! Everyone could see the might of Master Hong! Everyone could see the might of Master Hong! Master Jaguar. We have to thank that Fang Shiyu. If he didn't beat Lei Laohu to his current half-dying state, we couldn't have gotten the waterway transportation access. A couple is like two birds of the same forest that flew away separately when the disaster impended. Lei Laohu stepped down, it's up to Li Xiaohuan to be in charge of the business. She cleaned up her house. Here! Zhang Jinhong. You are not walking out of this door today. Master Hong. I gained the waterway transportation access because I deserved it. Even if you killed me, Li Xiaohuan won't give it to you again. That's between me and her. As for you, you robbed from us, you die. Master Hong, please don't kill me. I'll give you anything. Master Jaguar. Master Jaguar. Watch out! Oops! How dare you! Mr Five, you are here! All those twirling at day time won't make you dizzy? It's in bad taste to display affection in public. Mr Five, it's not what you think. Mr Five. What can I do for you today? My big brother, Zhang Jinhong, sent me to fetch the luminous pearl. The luminous pearl? I already gave it to Master Zhang. It's pretty bold of you to play this trick. Mr Five. Qiu Ming couldn't have done this. I would know, she is not capable of that. She only knows how to do tricks. Yeah! Cut the crap! Search! Yes! Hey! Mr Five. Mr Five, I found it, see. Take Qiu Ming! Yes! You wouldn't dare. Watch me. Are you stuck? Mr Five. Are you okay, Mr Five? Fine, Miao Abao! You hit me! I've been wanting to do that for a while. Go get 'em! This is for causing disputes and troubles. This is for being a bully. This is for mooching off the civilians. This is for hiding behind Zhang Jinhong! Abao, catch the needles. Roger that. Hey! Slow down, don't poke into my flesh. Again! Mr Five. Good things come in doubles. All done. Miao Abao. Turn! Turn around! Miao A... Miao... Miao Abao! At least I am the Mr Five of the Cliff City, how could you do this to me? And you sew us up to beat us! You can kill me, but you cannot shame me! Try and beat me to death! Let's just go! Miao Abao. Why don't you just kill me? Miao Abao! Watch out, Mr Five. Lift! Lift! Stop watching. Stay away! You stepped on me, piss off. Stop watching! What are you looking at? Do you not know who I am? Stop laughing! Stop watching! You disgrace! Go! Move! Stop watching! Turn! This is a nice ride. Miao Abao, just you wait! I'll come back for the scooter! Mr Five, this is mine now. See you around, Mr Five. Don't call me Mr Five! Miao Abao? Yes. The Miao Abao from Abao Clothing. I went looking for Qiu Ming today. I wanted to take her and give her to you. Who would have known that Miao Abao would step in? If you want to beat up a dog, you at least have to think about its owner. He almost killed me! You have to take revenge! Master Hong, please do this for me! So it seems that I have to pay this Miao Abao a visit. Milord, what's this for? I know you want to find Shiyu in Cliff City. But the situation is still tense out there. Hence the ropes. You just be patient for couple more days. After Li Xiaohuan called her lackeys back, I'll go to the Cliff City with you to be with Shiyu. Come on, you don't have to worry, milord. I wouldn't do anything to cause you trouble at a time like this. That's good. Then, how about this...? Just in case. Leave it there. Come on! Fang De! Just go to rest. We have some more acting to do tomorrow. It's not easy to be an actor. Miao Cuihua! Miss... Miss Wang. Miss Li. That's him! He got into trouble with Master Hong. Wha...? Mr Wang. I'll have ten steamed dumplings. I'm sorry, we are all out. There are obviously enough dumplings left. Oops. These are for my family. How about you check out some other places? Got in trouble with Zhang Jinhong, and he's still not aware of the disaster that's coming to him. Zhang Jinhong is here! Whoa! Brother Xiao, why are you here? Brother, I could ignore other people's business, but I have to help you. Master Hong. Why did you suddenly come into the city? Bring him. Mister Abao. Please give me a break. I'm so sorry. What are you doing up there? I was shooting at the sun. I got too hot. That's right, it's too hot. Brother Abao, I heard that Duan Five caused you trouble using me as an excuse tomorrow. I assure you, it didn't come from me. To prove my innocence, I brought him here today to apologize to you. What are you thinking now? You look happy. Seeing Duan Five apologizing today is really satisfying. You know, this Duan Five is usually very arrogant, but today he called you Mister. It's so funny. Speaking of, who is this Zhang Jinhong, really? I'm not so sure. I only know that he's not to be taken lightly. He made the county magistrate resign without a sound. That's when Duan Five started to exploit the civilians. So, actually, the scene he played with Duan Five today means that he's up to no good. Yeah. So, Fang Shiyu, you have to be careful. You mustn't leave any trace. Otherwise, you'll be in trouble, as well as your families. Qiu Ming. Yeah? You are so good to me. What are you guys doing? Who are you? Watch out, Qiu Ming! Watch out, son! Mom, why are you here? Mom? That's right. Flying needles without a trace, people call me the Invincible Whirlwind. This is Fang Shiyu's mother, Miao Cuihua. Yeah! It hurts. Watch it. Shiyu, put some medicine here. Okay, mom. Shiyu, rub my Zusanli point. It hurts. Your Zusanli point? Okay. Is it here? Shiyu, help me rub my Shousanli point. Of course, mom. I'll rub it for you. Is it here? Shousanli point. Shiyu, I want you to rub my Zusanli point. Shousanli point! Zusanli point! Shousanli point! Zusanli point! Shousanli point! Zusanli point! Shousanli point! Zusanli point! Hey! You guys are tearing me apart! Oh, right, mom. I can't believe my dad let you out this time. Of course not, that old goat. If I didn't play dirty, I would still be tied up to that bed. Hey. Who are you laughing at? Have you no respect? You are not seducing my son. I'll tell you this, tonight, my son and I are gonna have a long talk. He won't be sleeping with you. No one is sleeping with him! Mom! What are you doing, mom? Did you two not sleep together? What are you talking about, mom? We are living together illegally. No, just staying inside the same house. Son, this is where you are not like your father. Back in the day, your father was cool on the outside, sultry on the inside. He almost forced me on the night we met each other. Wow. I didn't expect that from my dad. Of course. Then I kicked him off the second floor. Up to this day, he's still suffering from lumbar disc herniation. But then again, we did have you. Yeah. So, you need to learn from your father, strike when needed. Do not hesitate. Rise and shine! Rise and shine! Since when did you learn to sleep in? It's still early. The sun's already up, it's not early! How many people did you offend, son? I didn't! What happened? Brother Abao. Everybody's waiting here. Come outside. Brother Xiao? Brother Xiao, what is this? Abao, Qiu Ming. The guys saw you teaching Duan Five a lesson. And you made that Zhang Jinhong to take Duan Five here to apologize. So everybody came to our squad to ask me act as a representative. We want you to be the new leader of the City Guard. No, no, no. I wouldn't possibly. Why not? This is a good thing. This is...? This is a good thing. I am Miao Abao's mother, the Whirlwind. Mrs Miao truly knows reason, swift like wind. Yeah. Mrs Miao, you know what's the right thing to do. That's right! Brother Abao, don't refuse. Yeah, Mr Abao. The City Guard has already dissolved. We are afraid that some other force would swoop in while we are weak. If you could be City Guard's leader, we would be so grateful. Yes! We would like to donate some resources. We just wanted to be safe. That's so great! Everybody, Abao hasn't been here for so long. What happened with Duan Five is purely an accident. Please forgive us. Please say yes, Miss Qiu. Yeah! Just say yes! Everybody, everybody, we who study martial arts value loyalty the most. If you all wanted Abao to be the leader of the City Guard, then we won't refuse. I'll take the job for my son. Auntie, you can't! Why not? Mom, stop butting in! It's settled. Wonderful! Mrs Miao. Great! Wonderful! Thank you guys! You have a good sense of character! There's nothing I could do! Thank you guys, thank you! Thank you guys, thank you! Miao Abao's gotten the support of the people pretty fast. He will be a trouble for us. The people in the Cliff City are used to be dependent. Besides, it will take some time to train the City Guard. Just one Miao Abao isn't enough to cause me trouble. You are absolutely right. I know the people in the Cliff City. Sooner or later, Miao Abao will be left to defend for himself. But Sha Xiao from the Security Guard has been controlling the Cliff City for years. Now he's taking Miao Abao's side. It's tough to deal with. Do you have any plans, Master Hong? Go find me some new faces. [Government Training Ground] It is our duty to protect the Cliff City. It is our duty to protect the Cliff City. We will not be afraid of our enemies, we will help the poor and the weak. This is the fundamental root for those who study martial arts. We are taking the responsibility of protecting the Cliff City at the request of the people. The old ways of mooching off the civilians will be gone. It is our job to protect the people now. I'll go decocting some herbs for their body. Hey, mom. Don't tell me you are going all medieval on them. Them? They won't be able to take it. What do you know? It will work better than your idea. Let's take a break. It's too hot. How long do we need to train? I don't know! I thought the City Guard would be as easy as the old times, that's why I sighed in. Who knows it will be this tough? It will get tougher. Come on, you guys. A little sweat won't hurt us. But I heard that the City Guard has great benefits. Is that so? As long as I'm getting paid, I'll be fine. Yeah! Yeah, that's right. What are you laughing about? Come over here. What is it? There is no money. We are doing a good deed. What does that mean, Duan Five? Back when I was in charge of the City Guard, the only way we were making money was by charging the civilians. Now, we are depending on rich person's donation from Cliff City. It won't even cover the day-to-day expenses. And Miao Abao has banned charging fees. There is no extra money to give you guys. That won't do! On what earth will people not getting paid after working? But, why are you here, then? I didn't have anywhere to go. That's right. An expired can-food is worse that a pile of crap. Oops! Hey. Why did all the people disband? I was only gone for a moment. They didn't disband. They left, it was too tired for them. I told you, this is not an easy job. Son, your idea didn't work. Watch me. Let's go. Mrs Miao, Mrs Miao! Hurts, hurts! This is like the ten greatest tourtures in Qing Dynasty. This is my most treasured training method. These bamboo stripes will help increase your bone density. And this medicine will tighten your muscles. It will massively increase your ability to fend for yourself. A couple more years of this, you will have a metal-like body as strong as Abao's. That's so amazing! Then I wouldn't be afraid of Miao Abao anymore. [White Tiger Gang] Master Hong. Everything is happening as you anticipated. The new recruits all wanted to resign from the City Guard once they heard there's no money. Yeah. Good job. But, you mustn't be careless. This Miao Abao is no ordinary folk. Yes. Keep a close eye on him. Yes! What's going on with your face? Master Hong. You know what, this Mrs Miao really do have an interesting training method. Yeah. I've always thought that Miao Abao is a bit strange. His bone structure is really strong. It's like he's wearing a metal shirt. Today, Mrs Miao told me that ever since he was little, Miao Abao was tied up with bamboo stripes. And he was soaked in medicine that gave him a body of metal. I was fortunate to experience that today. It really worked! You could try it out, too! The mighty strength of Master Hong could break up the mountain and earth! You were telling the truth? Not one single lie! How long has Miao Abao been in Cliff City? Less than two months. I once heard that one of the Five Elders of Shaolin Sect, Miao Xian, had a daughter, Miao Cuihua, who would use bamboo stripes and medicine wines to train her son. And her son is one of the famous Ten Tigers of the Shaolin Sect, Fang Shiyu. Miao Cuihua, Miao Abao. I'm afraid that this Miao Abao is the Fang Shiyu who hurt my brother Lei Laohu in Hangzhou City. You, head for Hangzhou City immediately. Go find Mrs Lei, Li Xiaohuan. Tell her that Fang Shiyu is hiding in the Cliff City. Yes, Master Hong. God help me. I was just worried about how to persuade Li Xiaohuan to give me back the waterway transportation access. Now I have the leverage I needed. Master Hong, the Security will be heading back to the Cliff City from a job in three days. Do you have any plans? I have plans, no need to concern yourself with it. Yes, Master Hong. [Three Days Later] Guys, could you please tell us which way is headed to the Cliff City? You are...? I am Chen Ping. This is my brother, Li Yue. We are martial performers of the Kun City theatrical troupe. Kun City is suffering from a plague of insects. We have to disband the theatrical troupe. We thought we could find a living in Cliff City. I am the leader of the Security Guard in Cliff City, Sha Xiao. I am the deputy, Ouyang Xin. Who are you? Leave no one alive. Thanks. Let's go! Brother, these are all new faces. And they don't have a tiger head tattoo on their hands. Maybe they are not from the White Tiger Gang. But we are already inside White Tiger Gang's turf. Zhang Jinhong is not that easy to guess. This has to be him. [Government Training Ground] Harder! Stable! Brother Abao! Stop. Take a break. Brother Abao. Where are all the people? That's not enough people. They thought it was too tough. And there's not much money. Most of them found an excuse and left. These two are...? Look at me, so forgetful. This is Chen Ping and Li Yue. We encountered some bandits on the way back from an escorting job. Thanks to these two guys, we made it out. I wanted to keep them at the Security Guard. But now that I saw this place, it seems that you need them more than me. How about it? We'll accept your arrangement. That's great! I'll be so honored! I'm in a good mood today. I rented the whole Jinfuzhuang to welcome you two! Let's drink! Let's go get hammered! Tonight, we celebrate! [Jinfuzhuang Restaurant] We met an honorable man. Cheers! Come on! Bottom's up! Brother? Brother Xiao, are you alright? He's drunk! Brother! What's going on, brother? Brother! Brother Xiao! Brother Xiao! I'm Abao! Brother, you are drunk! Let's do this another day. Brother! Mr Sha! He's our brother Abao! Brother Xiao! If you attack me again, I'm gonna fight back! Brother! Brother! Brother! Miao Abao! You killed my brother! I... Deputy! There must be some kind of misunderstanding. Yeah! A life for a life! Miao Abao! Give me back my brother! Stop! Mom! Deputy. Calm down. Mrs Miao. This is between me and Abao. Can you give us some privacy? Wait! Mrs Miao. What are you doing? Deputy. Even thought there's nothing out of the ordinary with Mr Sha's body, but I think his symptoms resembles being poisoned. Poison? I can't be sure. But I used to study medicine, we could use this silver hairpin to test it out. Okay. [Three Days Later] [White Tiger Gang] Where is Fang Shiyu? Sis! Welcome, welcome! Jinhong. We don't need these pleasantries. My objective here is simple. I want Fang Shiyu dead. If that's the case, you have nothing to be worried about. If everything goes along the plan, we can see Fang Shiyu's body tonight. Cheers! Great! Come on! Ever since I came to Cliff City, brother Xiao has always been good to me. I could ignore other people's business, but I have to help you. I wanted to keep them at the Security Guard. But now that I saw this place, it seems that you need them more than me. But now, he died because of me. Brother, we'll accompany you to the Security Guard to explain everything. I'm sure the deputy wouldn't blame you. Brother! Wake up! Abao! Who is it? Quite a show you just put on. Where is he? Over here. Let's all get hammered tonight! Of course! Definitely! Please, have a seat. There was this poison from the West, it goes into the lungs through the larynx. The person's heart will display symptoms of congestion quickly. On the surface, they would appear enraged, and would attack fiercely. But they cannot take any major hits. After they die, their body will look as the same as that of an ordinary man. Usually, it won't be easy to detect. But this poison will turn silver into dark green. Whoever is poisoned will show small luminous spots on their face and neck in the dark. This poison is the Datura Poison from the West. It is the most poisonous among the ten famous poisons. You came to Cliff City later than anybody else. Naturally, you are the most suspicious. I'm guessing that you were aware of Mr Sha's habit of never leaving his pipe behind. So you put the poison in his pipe when you saw a chance. Mr Sha. But these are just speculations. To prove that you are the perpetrators, I checked your clothes while you were training. But I didn't find any signs of Datura. But that doesn't mean you weren't the killers. I'm guessing that if you did kill Mr Sha, yet didn't choose to skip town immediately, that means your job is not finished. And you were running around Abao all day. I believe that your next target is him. You old fox. Mom. I still couldn't figure out why would brother Xiao only attack me. I didn't figure that out either. Until I came across something when I was going through some medicine books. The person who was poisoned by the Datura Poison will be extremely sensitive to the scent of the dicotyledons. It is incredibly off-putting to them. I remembered what Abao smelt like at that time. You smell really weird. That was the smell of lindenflowers. And lindenflowers are one of the dicotyledons. To make Mr Sha and Abao fight against each other, and start a conflict between the Security Guard and Abao, you put some lindenflower oil on Abao. Cheers! Another important clue is found when I was checking Mr Sha's torso. I accidentally noticed there were two lumbar fractures at the back of his waist. That seals my speculation. After Mr Sha was poisoned, Abao didn't use his true strength when fighting against him. It must be you. Mr Sha! You pushed hard behind his back to generate a huge force, and made it look like as if it was Abao's punch that killed him. It's quite impressive, a murder through the hands of another. Now that the truth is out there, give yourselves up. Take them! Yes! Who are you really? We are the Voodoo Assassins from the West. I am Nan Sha. This is Hei Hu. This is a regard from Master Zhang. Quite a rival. I've heard of this organization. They are really good at enchantments. Be careful. Yes. Prepare to die! Deputy! Watch out, son! Switch! Let me pluck out your claws and stick them into your heart. Sticking your tail into your rear end. Maybe I can't touch a tiger's butt, but I can kick yours. Kick! Kick! Kick! Deputy! Are you alright? It's fine, I'll make it. This way. Get out of there, Fang Shiyu! Li Xiaohuan? You are Fang Shiyu? There's no way left for you to run. Surrender yourselves. Mr Fang, Deputy! Come here! I'll show you guys the back door! Hurry! Hurry up! Come on! Hurry up! Hurry up you guys! Brother, brother! Brother, brother! Let's go together! Just go! Or no one could leave! Son, this isn't the time to act irrationally,we are outnumbered! Mr Fang, let's just go! Come on! Let's go! Brother! Shiyu! Talk, where did Fang Shiyu go? Follow them! Wait. Don't worry, sis. Instead of going after him, we could just sit and wait for them to come for us. Come and see! Everybody, come and see! Come and see! What is this? Everybody, come and see! What is this? Everybody, come and see! What's it saying? The Security Guard of Cliff City is in cahoots with the wanted criminal, Fang Shiyu. They deserved to die. They will be executed in public three days later. Should anyone covered up for them, you will be given a death sentence as well. How could it be? What did he do? Yeah! Execution in public? Brother Xiao's body is not even cold yet, the deputy was held captive for us. I won't let anything happen to him. Shiyu, calm down. We are no match of Zhang Jinhong and Li Xiaohuan. If we acted rashly, no only can we not save the deputy, we wouldn't even be able to protect ourselves. That's right. We have to do this smartly. No blunt force. Master, Mrs Lei. I searched all the places in Cliff City today, everybody who was good with Fang Shiyu. There's no sign of him. So you are saying he's just disappeared? Don't worry, sis. We've sent out the notice. We'll execute those people tomorrow. Fang Shiyu will be there. But they are wily, full of tricks. I'm afraid they will run off again tomorrow. Rest assured. Master had it all planned out. Please, sis! Please. There will be a crowd at the execution tomorrow. Fang Shiyu and the others are well-versed in martial arts. And they have eyes inside the Cliff City. We mustn't underestimate them. I've arranged several martial arts masters from our gang to blend into the crowd. They will be equipped with a knife. As long as Fang Shiyu and the others appear, they can launch a surprise attack. Tomorrow at the execution, aside from the bandits and the musketeers that we could see, there will be some guards hiding in the crowd, waiting to attack us. They will have a tiger head tattoo on their wrists. Shiyu, auntie. You blend into the crowd after you put on some disguise. Find the tattoo man and stick the poisoned needles into their muscles. As long as they try to use their strength, they will collapse. And it will be a big crowd, so we have to be careful. The two posts and the execution stand formed a triangle. This other post have a direct vision of who's going inside or outside of the execution ground. We can see all of the execution stand from the wall. They will have musketeers at these three spots as a high-firing point. We have to take down this post. Qiu Ming, you are an excellent shooter, you take down the post in the back. Yes. You four, take the two posts in the front. Others set up an ambush around the execution stand. We'll set up three posts, and have musketeers to stand guard. There will also be forces on the ground. Fang Shiyu and the others will not escape death this time even if they could fly into the sky or hide underground. Everybody, the Cliff City has always been a place of law. But, not long ago, a wanted man sneaked inside our city. He was vicious in nature. He's full of evilness. He once committed a felony in Hangzhou City. But he's still unpunished by law. What are you doing? I wanted to touch you. What? I think you want to die. This is all because there are people helping Fang Shiyu. They are helping Fang Shiyu to escape. They have disregarded the law. They are Ouyang Xin and the guards of the Cliff City Security Guard. Yes. I'm exhausted. Let's go inside and take a break. Let's go. To make Cliff City a better place, we have to execute them, to set an example. The time has come. Execute! This is so cruel and heartless. Who are you? What's going on? Murder! Help! Murder! What's going on? There's something wrong with the barrels, check the barrels! Son of a bitch! Run! Run! This is Fang Shiyu from the Shaolin Sect! Fang Shiyu. Go and get 'em! Fang Shiyu. Stop! Dad! Mom! Save us! Dad! Unhand my mom! Shut up! Release them! Fang Shiyu. If you don't surrender, I will kill them. Don't kill me! Don't touch my wife, kill me instead! Don't move! Get down! Let them go. I'll do whatever you want. Fang Shiyu. Kneel! Duan Five. If I counted to three, and he didn't kneel, kill her. No! Three. No! Wife! You asshole! Zhang Jinhong! Duan Five. I'll fight you! Zhang Jinhong! Fang Shiyu. I thought you are tough. Ah! Son! Shiyu! Shiyu! Everybody in the Cliff City knows, if you mess with me, you will die. No exceptions! No! Shiyu, Shiyu! We've come to rescue you! Dad, Meiyu, Xiaoyu! Milord! Milord! Come on, Milord! Oh my god, milady! It's you! Are you okay? I'm fine, now that I saw you. After I got your letter, I didn't stop for a minute before I headed for Cliff City. Your timing is impeccable, milord. I know you treasure me the most. Lady, how are you? I... I'm... Milord. Are you fine now? Yeah. Go help your son. Don't worry, I'll be here. Punk. I knew you would cause troubles if I wasn't here. Dad, save the family rules after we got back home. Fight first. Let's go! Yeah! Dad! Brother. Cliff City is in your hands from now on. Don't worry, Shiyu. You've got a long trip ahead, take care of yourself. Yes. Mom. There's this one more thing. I know. You knew? Mom! When did you learn how to do this? It's a secret. It's getting late. Let's go. Yes. See you around. See you around. [Directed by: Arthur Liu]
