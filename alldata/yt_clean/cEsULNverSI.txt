&gt;&gt;Eric Flickinger: Welcome brought to you We're glad that you We are on a journey, a journey looking at some that run through This week, we're looking This is the fulfillment Let's begin with prayer. Father, we want to thank You for leading us and giving us a clear picture as we study the gospel We ask that You'll bless and we thank You [both] amen. We're grateful to have guiding us along this journey, He is the senior research at the Theological Seminary, Tom, thanks &gt;&gt;Tom Shepherd: &gt;&gt;Eric: Let's move quickly-- we've got a lot to the book of John, In John 5, Jesus talks that He has with His Father. Lead us through this, &gt;&gt;Tom: Okay, so John, chapter 5 healing the man And of course, when He And so, the--and He told the man which he does, and he but eventually he and then he goes and tells He doesn't seem to quite get it, And so they persecute Jesus because He was doing So in John 5, verse 17: 'My Father is working You know, when you think of it, God can't stop working If He did, we'd all die So He continues to do things. It's kind of like pastors, but that we're very busy So verse 18 is in the Gospel of John: were seeking notice, they're already &quot;because not only&quot;-- &quot;not only was He &quot;but He was even calling making Himself equal with God.&quot; Now, some people get indeed, Jesus And that--so it's okay Well, that's not Jesus connects Himself, to the whole understanding He connects Himself-- &quot;My Father is working and I am working.&quot; So, it says here that &quot;not only &quot;but He was even calling making Himself equal with God.&quot; The reason He is because He is God, and as God Now, what happens is evidently Jesus I think the book tells us that He's And what Jesus does is And so we'll read a little bit what witnesses does He call So verses 19 through 24, &gt;&gt;Eric: &quot;Then Jesus &quot;'Most assuredly, I say to you, &quot;'the Son can do &quot;'but what He sees &quot;'for whatever He does, &quot;'the Son also does &quot;'For the Father loves the Son, &quot;'and shows Him all things &quot;'and He will show Him &quot;'that you may marvel. &quot;'For as the Father raises &quot;'even so the Son &quot;'For the Father judges no one, &quot;'but has committed &quot;'that all should honor the Son &quot;'He who does not honor the Son &quot;'does not honor &quot;'Most assuredly, I say to you, &quot;'and believes in Him who sent &quot;'and shall not come but has passed &gt;&gt;Tom: Okay, so here's between Jesus and His Father. He's going to say &quot;I and the Father which echoes the Shema of the Jews, that &quot;the Lord our God, And so Jesus says, They have the same-- We have another study about the Father, and Their relationship But the Father in Their goals, They're not the same individual. We saw that actually that &quot;the Word was with God.&quot; He isn't the same as the Father. He's two separate--these But They have this close, And He says, but has given &gt;&gt;Eric: So it seems like we've here between the Father Now, also we get the idea that Scripture in helping us Walk us through some of this. &gt;&gt;Tom: Yeah, so Jesus And He calls Down in chapter 5, verse 33: and he has borne witness John is a witness to Jesus. &quot;And the Father &quot;Himself borne witness &quot;His voice you have never heard, and you do not [know] &quot;have His word abiding in you, for you do not believe Now, verse 39 and 40 tell us of how the Scriptures witness. So why don't you read those. &gt;&gt;Eric: &quot;You search &quot;for in them you think &quot;and these are they But you are not willing to come &gt;&gt;Tom: Yeah, He says the very Scriptures are the ones And we're going as we look at various prophecies that are fulfilled and described here &quot;You search the Scriptures &quot;you have eternal life; ...it is [these very Scriptures] He goes on to talk about, &quot;Do not think that I &quot;There is one &quot;Moses, on whom you &quot;For if you believed Moses, &quot;for he wrote of me. But if you how will you believe my words?&quot; It reminds me of the parable in the book of Luke. And the big emphasis there believe the prophets, and that then you what you're being told to do And the rich man &quot;Well, but if you send then, you know, And He's like, &quot;Moses and the prophets, even if somebody All right, so now we should look at some of these prophecies So the first text is John 1, verse 23. And we're going to parallel that to the text So you look up the text the text in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt;Eric: So over verse number 23, &quot;'of one crying &quot;'&quot;Make straight as the prophet Isaiah said.&quot; &gt;&gt;Tom: Yeah, so Isaiah 40, verse 3: &quot;'In the wilderness prepare make straight in the desert So He's very clearly tying So we have &gt;&gt;Eric: So over it says, speaking of Jesus: &quot;And He said to those &quot;'Take these things away! &quot;Do not make my Father's house &quot;Then His disciples remembered 'Zeal for Your house &gt;&gt;Tom: It's an interesting Jesus cleansing the temple. That has a link starting in verse 6: &quot;Let not &quot;be put to shame through me, &quot;let not those who seek You &quot;be brought &quot;O God of Israel. &quot;For it is for Your sake &quot;that dishonor &quot;I have become a stranger &quot;an alien to my mother's sons. &quot;For zeal for Your house &quot;and the reproaches &quot;have fallen on me. &quot;When I wept and humbled &quot;it became my reproach. When &quot;I became a byword to them. &quot;I am the talk of those and the drunkards So it's interesting how he's zealous but people are, Well, it's the very same thing in the Gospel of John Now, let's turn talking about Jesus' death &gt;&gt;Eric: In verse number 36 it says: &quot;For these &quot;that the Scripture 'Not one of His bones &gt;&gt;Tom: All right, so this &quot;The Lord spoke &quot;'Speak to the people of Israel, &quot;'saying, &quot;If any one of you &quot;'&quot;is unclean through touching &quot;'&quot;or...in a long journey, &quot;'&quot;he shall still keep &quot;'&quot;In the second month &quot;'&quot;at twilight &quot;'&quot;They shall eat it with &quot;'&quot;and bitter herbs. They &quot;'&quot;until the morning, nor break &quot;'&quot;according to all the statute they shall keep it.&quot;'&quot; they didn't break And of course, Jesus who takes away And so we've seen already that point us back and how not just not just one little text, that gives us deeper insight &gt;&gt;Eric: And these are I've heard different estimates that were fulfilled, and I've heard And this is just a taste of it. Now, we've been able into the study guide, but not all of it. There's a lot more to read, to learn Share a little bit about that. &gt;&gt;Tom: Okay, we have and it goes more than what's more than what's in So if you're a teacher, If you're a class member, this just gives you and you can join in in more detail as you study it. So we recommend you get it, &gt;&gt;Eric: It's very easy to find. You can just get it itiswritten.shop. Look for the companion book to this quarter's It is, of course, on &quot;The We're going to continue of some of these Old Testament showing us that indeed Jesus is when we come back here on It Is Written. &gt;&gt;John Bradshaw: The prophet about the rise the fate of nations, Join me for &quot;Kingdom Come.&quot; We'll witness the rise We'll understand symbols found And we'll learn to our current reality. Waiting for the world We exist in the midst in a world wrestling of sickness, war, and death. Yet God encourages us: The interpretation Jesus is coming back soon. Don't miss &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; as we explore &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; &gt;&gt;male announcer: Loving And loving well means wanting &quot;Go ye therefore&quot; becomes, &quot;Send me across the world &quot;Work in me to impact lives &quot;And if I can't go myself, &quot;I want to send the everlasting gospel It Is Written's Office gives you the opportunity to make a major impact to lead others in preparation for eternity. Let God use you To learn more, That's HisLegacy.com. &gt;&gt;Eric: Welcome back brought to you We're taking a look great themes in the book the fulfillment of Old And, Tom, we've been through John the Baptist being the cleansing of the temple, no bone being broken these being fulfilled in Jesus. What's the next one? &gt;&gt;Tom: All right, at John, chapter 12 if you could read &gt;&gt;Eric: It says they &quot;took &quot;and went out to meet Him, &quot;'&quot;Blessed is He who comes The King of Israel!'&quot; So this is the triumphal entry. And so they're using and it actually comes from Psalm 118, so if we look at Psalm 118, it says, &quot;Save us, &quot;O Lord, we pray, &quot;Blessed is he who comes &quot;We bless you &quot;The Lord is God, and He has &quot;Bind the festal sacrifice up to the horns of the altar!&quot; So this was something in the sacrificial experience But here's the very words from the Old Testament: &quot;Blessed is he who comes &gt;&gt;Eric: We've got kind of continuing of the triumphal entry, John, chapter 12, It says, &quot;Then Jesus, when He &quot;sat on it; as it is written: behold, your King is coming, &gt;&gt;Tom: All right, so this is Zechariah, chapter 9, and Zechariah actually ties but Zechariah 9 and verse 9 &quot;O daughter of Zion! &quot;Shout aloud, &quot;Behold, Your King &quot;righteous and having &quot;humble and mounted the foal of a donkey.&quot; So this is exactly He has His disciples They go borrow a donkey They put their clothes on it. People strew their garments on the ground in front of Him, and they were saying, So everybody understood And yeah, it's a fulfillment but it's also something When David gave he had him ride on a donkey and they did this; So Jesus is claiming Himself Now, the next one with John, chapter 13, verse 18. &gt;&gt;Eric: In John 13, verse 18, &quot;I do not speak &quot;I know whom I have chosen; &quot;but that the Scripture &quot;'He who eats bread with me has lifted up &gt;&gt;Tom: Right, and this If we read Psalm 41, &quot;They say, 'A deadly thing &quot;he will not rise again &quot;Even my close friend in whom &quot;has lifted his heel against me. &quot;But you, O Lord, and raise me up, All right, so here we have of what Judas Iscariot would do. Betrayer, he ate He was there Jesus washed his feet, and yet Judas went out Another of these texts links us John 19, verse 37. &gt;&gt;Eric: In verse 37 it says, says, 'They shall look on Him So that seems to be to the Crucifixion. &gt;&gt;Tom: Yeah, so you have Why don't you read verse 36 and verse 37. &gt;&gt;Eric: &quot;For these things &quot;that the Scripture &quot;'Not one of His bones &quot;And again 'They shall look on Him &gt;&gt;Tom: Okay, in writing this is quoting in relationship and how it was to be taken, and you weren't to break And now he's referring to which says, &quot;And I will pour out &quot;and the inhabitants &quot;a spirit of grace &quot;so that, when they look on me, &quot;they shall mourn for Him, &quot;as one mourns &quot;and weep bitterly over Him, as one weeps So, striking parallels and the life of Jesus. Now, these are There are other texts that our gospel writers in relationship and some of the things It's really interesting. Actually, at the cross, quote from the Old Testament. Now, do they know You know, maybe they do, but they use these terms and the gospel writers and they'll say, well, Here's what people said. And sometimes the people, didn't know that they were fulfilling scripture And they look back and say, &quot;Oh, you know, And wow, that was of a prophecy about Him. Now, that would be you know, that you when you didn't even realize that would fulfill It's like being the answer You know, I remember when we An old pastor had wanted to have When he retired, he didn't go He went where there and he raised up a church. And then he wanted a clinic, that he burned bricks, and had them ready. Well, there were people who had their eyes Some of the government people wanted to use them to build and they kept pressuring him. And I was the director at that time there in Malawi, and I had not seen And one day I showed up, we showed up in my little Jeep. We had not been--told anybody. We had not told anybody Knocked on his door and I said, &quot;Pastor Kamwendo, &quot;I'm here to see those bricks We're gonna build And he was so excited because in his house there were policemen, who were there And when he came back-- and he came back, and he said, for policemen's houses. We're [chuckles] So it's nice to be And it's wonderful of these prophecies &gt;&gt;Eric: And as you mentioned, many more than we've I want to jump over to John 8 I'm going to read and then ask you Over in John 8, verse 12, spoke to them again, saying, &quot;'He who follows me &quot;but have &quot;The Pharisees &quot;'You bear witness of Yourself; &quot;Jesus answered &quot;'Even if I bear witness &quot;'for I know where I came from &quot;'but you do not know &quot;'and where I am going. &quot;'You judge according to &quot;'And yet if I do judge, &quot;'for I am not alone, &quot;'but I am with the Father &quot;'It is also written in your law &quot;'that the testimony &quot;'I am One who bears &quot;and the Father who sent me &quot;Then they said to Him, &quot;Jesus answered, &quot;'You know neither me &quot;'If you had known me, &quot;you would have known &quot;These words Jesus spoke &quot;as He taught in the temple; for His hour had not yet come.&quot; You'd think there's &gt;&gt;Tom: Yeah, and you know, to that experience where we said there as witnesses, and now He And they just don't believe Him. And they say, He already told them, you know? And so you can talk sometimes people say, It's really sad that they because He went and He was a challenge And that's a great lesson you know, sometimes they need to hear the truth, And that can always be dangerous for the person Well, it was for Jesus, if we're persecuted We should always but we should speak the truth. &gt;&gt;Eric: So if someone and they're trying to say, do I apply I want to speak the truth. I want to be What are some guidelines, that I can keep if I want God to use me? &gt;&gt;Tom: Well, I always speak Christ always did. He had no one that He He wanted to bring everybody in. The decision would as to whether they Now, Jesus--we are not Jesus. So we can be sure with the truth of the Scripture, but we should always prepare If you're studying don't just bring out some truth to whatever they've that it's impossible for them Build a case slowly. Guide people with the Scripture. Don't assume too many things, and actually just be a friend. Everybody has some great experiences Listen to them and affirm them And then the truth can have and be a blessing to them. &gt;&gt;Eric: So build build those relationships, and relationships as a bridge There's plenty of evidence We've been through but there's And God, by His grace will give you opportunities with people that you come if your heart and your mind We're continuing our study when we come back We're making our way through, to the end but we're not there yet. Still some significant and we want to invite We're going to be into the book of John, bringing out as we continue to study. And we'll be back here on &quot;Sabbath School,&quot; brought to you [Captions provided by Aberdeen
