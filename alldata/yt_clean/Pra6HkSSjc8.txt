STAY TUNED! So, let's go! Today we are here with pro Indonesian player Jens Raven. - How are you doing? I'm also very good, thank you very much. Today, I'm not alone. I'm joined by the tallest referee in the world, Michiel Callebaut. - Nice to meet you. This is the first time I'm shaking hands with my left hand. Yeah, me too. We got many comments, &quot;Film a video with a pro Indonesian player.&quot; You are the one. And I have a shirt for you. Oh, nice, nice. Sheep heads. The sheepheads. There is just one thing I don't understand about this team. - The colors are green, white, red, white, black. - So, what are the colors of Dordrecht? But the logo is red and white. Yes, I don't know why to be honest, but our shirts are always green and white. - I know why. This is for you, Indonesia. There's a link. Now it's time for the big deal. - Yeah. - Oh... Wow, FC25 card. And look here, everything is red and white. - That's amazing. We've got six challenges and we will rate your FC 25 card. What would your rating be? Uh... 38, 38 minimum. But I need to say one thing. - Yeah... oh... I'm sorry. - 83, 83 minimum. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You are very humble, very humble. So, for Pace, we will have three sprints. Can I beat Jens in this? Are you guys ready? - Yes. So, when I clap, you jump and you run to the first ball. - Yeah, okay. Ready? - I saw the hand like... Oh yeah, I think Jens won. - Oh... It was a close call. - Very close. So, jump... Run! Behind the line. - Come on. - My whistle? Where is my whistle? - What? Koen! - Koen! Goon to the rescue. - Koen to the... Dark red, dark red. Yeah! Deserved. - Oh-oh. No, no, no. Yellow, yellow. You can stay. Yeah, oh, Koen is fast. Koen! - The referee is not awake with Jens? Koen is in my head. Oh, Jens is faster, faster, faster. Pace, what do you think? - Hmm. - I know, I know. - The first 2 were really close calls. You are very fast. I go for 84. Thank you. - 84. - Shooting. Let's see. All right, shooting will be harder. Michiel, can you explain this challenge, please? What do you think? - Oh... By the shooting, he will see, he will see. - Yeah... Oh... Oh, face off. - He's cutie. Cutiepie. This is a beautiful football. Because we've got five shots for each person. Five touches, four touches. Don't cross this line. - Rock, paper, scissors... shoot. - Oh, you can choose. - You can start. - Oh, five touches. - 1... 2... 3... - 4... - What a save! Koen is on fire! - Now it's your turn. Five touches. My cutie pie! Why is he saying cutie pie? Koen, a bit of respect, okay? Big cutiepie! - Come on, Jens. - 1... 2... 3... 4... Oh... - Oh, Koen is on fire. Oh, what are you doing? - What a joke! - 3... oh! - Oh, no, no, no... I'm missing one! Oh, good shot! - He's saving everything. Where's my card? - He wants his own card now. Four touches. - Come on. No, no. Oh... That guy. - 1... 2... 3... Come on. There you go! Because he said cutiepie, he has a big problem now. Three touches. - 1... 2... - Oh, no, no, no. Crazy great save. What am I doing? I hope you are better at football than at counting. This is a disaster. Three touches. 1... 2... Koen is in... beast mode. Yeah, it's crazy. - 2 touches. 1... 2... - Thank you. Don't mess this up. - 1... - Oh... To beat Koen, it needs to be perfect. Yeah, again a nice shot, but Koen is on fire. It's difficult today. - Yes, now we want the goal. - Come on, make it. A twerk or someth-- No! Come on. - Oh, there is a celebration. Is that your celebration? Oh, look. He's doing good, yeah, but when it comes to the big pressure - ...zero chance. He's right, 2-2. So the last shot is going to be very important between me and Koen. And the last shot is with one touch. - Don't say it again. Jens, what is this? My last celebration when I took the photo shoot for the Timnas Indonesia. So, when I score a goal, on Instagram they post a picture of me - ...and this is my celebration. - OK, come on Celine. One goal. Boom! You broke the stadium. Boom! - Oh, I want to see this. - I want to see this. - OK. That was a great goal. That was a great goal. Double. Double. One promise. I'll never again be your cutiepie. - I'm never again your cutiepie. It was a beast shot. - Yeah, yeah. Thank you. - You had some good saves, man. I have good news. So, the first time he scored, he did like this. Second time he scored, he did like this. But what will he do when he scores three times? - Oh, no, no. 30k likes on this video and we rate Koen's card. Yeah, that's a deal. We only do it if Jens is involved. Yeah, OK. - That's a deal. - There we go. - But now... Your card. - Deal. Eighty... eight. - Oh, yes. - So, next up we have Passing. &quot;Ay, ay, ay, ay&quot; I need to win one challenge. Maybe I'm better at passing? Koen is ready and Koen is the target. So, we've got six places for a pass - ...and you can rate. No, no. We start here and if you miss, I go home. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. I like how none of you puts it on the penalty spot. The respect is there. - We need to be a little bit in the middle. OK. This is going good. A nice pose. Oh, ho-ho... Celine. - Yes! - No, no goal. - Oh, clean. Oh, I like that one. - Celine goes first. - It hit the post. Come on. That was crazy. - Thank you. Maybe for this one, Koen, a bit like this. - More? Looking nice, looking good. He goes... And we also have some stuff in the middle - Yeah. - Oh! Unlucky. This is sick, this is sick. - This is sick. I think the same as my stretching. - It was 99. But the passing is 100. - I think... Let's go for that. KDB is nothing against this. - This is some crazy stuff. - That was amazing. OK. This was crazy. Now Jens will go 1-v-1 against me to show his dribbling skills. Wish me luck. - You ready, Jens? - We want to see some Neymar skills. I'm a very good defender. OK. - Sorry, Koen. - You do nothing. NOTHING! - I think if you put a cone, it's more difficult. - We will swap, so I will defend now. Look at the colors. What? She said I'm a cone. - No, no, no. You know what? - What? but this is for the next time, okay? Koen. - We got this, we got this. They definitely not. &quot;Vamos!&quot; - No, no. Wow. - Are you okay? Just put down 2 cones. Just put two cones. No, no. Koen, you go defending. But, Koen, he's a little bit mental, you know? Oh, no. - Come on, Jens. - Koen, Koen... Koen. I caught it, I caught it... I caught it. You had two attempts. Zero saves. One attempt. One save. - Oh. OK. Let's see. Come on. Uh, OK. Koen, sorry. - I should have saved that. - Well, that was good. - Yeah, well done, well done. Editor, don't do a replay on his fake shots. NO Yes. - Let's see. - Let's go. - Yes. I'm here. I'm here. You got this. - Oh! Too easy. It's too easy. So, dribbling, we can't give him 100, right? - No. Let's do 2 touch. - ...some skills. Oh. Look at this. Let's make it a bit more difficult. OK. OK... OK... - Wow. Oh... - Was that 3? Oh, no... - He said a bit more difficult. - We can decide together. I think it's very good. What? 21... 21? - No. - Oh, OK. - Nine! - 92. That's a great score. So, now it's not the &quot;SIXT&quot;, but the "FIFTH" rating. - Hey, that's nice. No advertising. Wow. Dribbling is pretty good, but is he also good at defending? Let's see. - Let's go, Celine! No! ... Too slow. But defense was good. - Yeah, it was great. Come on. Koen! Oh, that really was a good action. - This one, good action. I'm the defender. Oh. KDB is there. Koen, Koen, Koen. - Change? - No. - OK. Then we need to see Koen. So... One of me and one of Koen. Yeah. We need to see it from different people, you know, for the rating. That's important. We need to score one. - Referee... Come on! Imagine! - No goal. COMMENT &quot;CUTIEPIE&quot; BELOW We started with 5, but let's do 3 for Celine, 3 for me and 3 for Koen. So we see the defending skills of Jens. - Is that okay for you? - Yes, of course. - Let's see! Come on! Referee! - &quot;Siuuu!&quot; Final one. High pressure, high pressure. - That's also good. - High pressure... yeah, yeah, yeah. That was like, wow... Koen, 3 times. Your turn. Come on! Let's see, come on! - That was... Yeah, yeah, exactly. - No, not a nutmeg. It was a good block. - Good block. - Good block. Yeah. WAS IT A NUTMEG? Koen, where are your skills? - Good! - You have skills. Show it in the last attempt. OK. Come on, Koen! - Final... - More skills, more skills. - Yeah, yeah, more, more, more. - More skills, more skills. But I think Jens is not that bad at defending. - Koen, what do you think? - This? You're scared to... to... Me... ...scared too, you know? Me scared you. Defending? Maybe we all say one and we take the average. - Who starts? I will say also 55. And then I say 62. Yeah, but... - Sorry. But we skip the average. So minus 20, 32 maybe. Maybe 39 then. Okay. Otherwise people will say it's too fake. Now it's real. - Yes. We never take Koen anymore. Let's say he's not Sergio Ramos, but his defending is not that bad. Can he also surprise us at physicality? For the next challenge, Jens needs to wrestle against me. - Yeah. Like... Boom! Every corner, every free kick, the defenders and strikers... - ...are doing like this. Let's see how strong he is. - Oh, I like the movement. I like the movement. You need to be smart. - You need to be smart. He never saw it like that. I felt like... shh-shh! - That was good. Let's go. Look, look, look. - And he's scoring everything. Let's go. Maybe I'm just a terrible defender. - I think... - Yes, of course. But I will do like a little bit more. Just like... - No, Koen. He's good. Your turn, your turn. - He's strong, he's strong. Koen, you see? That's what I mean. Beast mode. - Koen... So Rudiger style. This is Rudiger style. - That was good. No, no, no, no, no... OK, you defend one more? You're not normal. When I go at goal, something clicks. Goalkeepers are crazy, but you are... - ...very crazy. - OK, I go... Referee! Koen! Koen, it's a penalty. Penalty! I got this, I got this. He scored. Panenka! - Oh, you scored. - Amazing. Is that a word? - Oh. Oh. I think 86. That was a very Dutch 86. - Eighty... - I agree again. - Eighty... - ...seven. - Oh, you're kind to me! Wow, what a card. The big moment now. Yeah. I want to see like 3 penalties from you... - ...and 3 from Celine. - I like that. Koen, are you ready? Uh... maybe. Maybe. Of course I'm ready!!! Boniface still have nightmares from you. Let's go. The save! What a save! What a save! But Boniface also scored a fake shot once. REMEMBER THIS ONE? - He's done playing. He's done playing. Oh, never mind, never mind. First penalty. - Good one, good one. Fingertips. - No. What is he doing? - He's too happy. I know it already. Oh, no. Amazing. You need to take a little break or you're fit? - I think you should be afraid. - Oh, yes. - What side? - Really? - Come on! - Let's go. Sorry about this. Nice. I was singing. - This is... - It's your last one. - It's one against one. OK. - Great goal. Yeah, come on. Tell me. He's going, I think, to the same side. - Referee. He did like this. - Koen! - No, if you ask for a card... - You got a card. - Oh, yes. &quot;Siuuu!&quot; - Perfect. Let's go. If you both score, it's a draw. Little kiss on the ball for you. WHISTLE - Ouch! Now your left foot. Here. - Now it's enough. Jens, we need a new goalkeeper. No, Koen! Five weeks suspended. Last penalty of the day. - No, no, no, no. For you, yellow one, because you were diving. - What?! And for you, the second red card. My knee. Second yellow. Second yellow. - It's the second yellow. - Oh, no. Third yellow. - First red. I will take the penalty. Do I really have to stand here with you? So, this is for Celine. - You ready, Jens? Did you Jens' dive? - The dive was good. - I think too. Eight or...? - Yes. - 88. - Oh, you're nice. - Thank you. Yeah. Looks good. - You... - Yes... yeah, yeah. - And I'm good at walkout, you know. Jens... Raven! - Thank you very much for being here, Jens. - Thanks for having me. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Follow Jens. - Thank you. - Follow Jens on all his socials. - Let's hit 30k likes for part 2. - ...this crazy goalkeeper. - For this goalkeeper.
