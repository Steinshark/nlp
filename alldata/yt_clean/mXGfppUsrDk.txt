Alright. We're checking out the only game where the more rock slides, the more my will to live slides. It's GTA. We wanted to put cars in GTA against rock slides. And so Alex has created a brand new challenge. Rock slides were always bad enough as is, but give Alex free rein. He creates a board that he says in his own words is brutal. There's classic rock slides and ramping rock slides. And because Alex hates me, there's also heat seeking rock slides. Alex has given me all these different cars so I can try and tank the rock slides, I can try and outrun the rock slides, but as always, only one can make it to the end. Let's do this. I wish I could say I'm excited to get inside of this bus. I am not at all excited to get inside of guess I guess Alex is excited for me to get inside of this bus, though. I'm not gonna lie. Part of me picked this because I think it's going to be amazing watching this thing try and make it through a rock slide. I also noticed too did you put us in the middle of an aviary or something? Alex, there are. Did that bird just get owned by a rock? I'm pretty sure I just saw a bird get owned by a rock and fly off the right side of the screen. At least I won't be alone. Nah, that's right, birds. We're in this together. If I get stuck on the very first rock before I even get to the rock slide, I'm gonna go insane. Can you guys do your gunfight somewhere else? I'm trying to do an Alex challenge over here. Okay, so OOH high. Well, the rocks have a lot of mass to them on this day, don't they? Oh, God. I'm not off yet. Never mind. Now I am. There's a blood stain down here that I did not create. All right, we got to do better than that. Come on, bus. I want to see you at least get I want to see you at least get halfway through the rocks. I love these slow you gradual deformation of the bus. Yeah, I think you guys are a little late, man. I mean, that guy's been laying there for like 30 minutes. Oh, yeah. Oh, this is okay. This was a terrible idea. Ow. What happened? Looks like I had the left. Alright, we're going legit. Here's the idea. Normally this would be a really stupid plan, but it's a rock slide, so we can dodge the rocks with something really small. Okay. The bigger something is, the more likely it's gonna get hit. But with what I was going to say is, with something this small, we should be really good at dodging lol. Ow. Would I have like, a target or something? Hey, stop beating up my quad. I want. Oh, my God. I'll make it stop. They're trying to push me off. I get the feeling this is going to be a lot hard than I previously gave it credit for. Okay, there we go. There we go. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah, we just got a hug. My elbow. Joints. Just got to hug the wall. Hug the wall, baby. Oh. Whoa. I made it past the rock slide. Oh, God. Oh, my quad. Hold on. It's okay. Now. Will I be able to get back to it and pilot it further along? No, probably not. I'll probably be getting murdered. Oh, maybe not. These rocks are the devil. I'm serious. These rocks have they got, like, the barred barred AI inside of these rocks. They're too smart for their own good. It's like the T 1000 of rocks. Oh, my head is inside the engine block. That's not great. Go ahead. Get back on this thing. I am still alive. The rocks are missing me by millimeters. This is amazing. It's a stallone movie. There we go. Okay, so it is possible. I just have really bad luck. Rock slide jump. Okay, sure. Okay, we're gonna get a lot of speed, and I'm gonna go just tell you right now, there's no use pretending that there's any skill involved. We just gonna get lucky. I didn't go far enough. Doing this part makes me want to die. No joke. If it doesn't make it this time, I'm giving up, because I'm okay. Got to do it one more time. I was going to say, getting past this rock slide is so brutal that I don't want to have to do it again, but I got so close. Please. Oh, actually, it's pushing. The rocks are pushing my quad to the end. I hate you so much. Okay, let's pick a new car. Oh, this is just a day of bad choices. Let's go with something with a lot of speed. Now, the plan is the rocks will slide off of this, see, because it's angle. All right, so this way, the rocks. Just well, it doesn't really take the rocks that Alex has embedded in the ground very well. This thing has no ground clearance. God, I'm getting stuck. 2 seconds into the challenge. All right. Let's see how good my plan MMM. Now, you may be saying, great. What are you doing? I'm calculating distance. My plan for maximum efficiency is to use one grenade to blow up both failures at the same time. Just trust me on this. See, it has a platform on the top so I could just hold all the rocks. Okay? This way, the rocks won't nudge me off the platform because I'll be catching them. This is a great idea. Possibly the best idea I have ever had in life. Look at that right there, working. Not at all like I had anticipated. I know things didn't go well the first time, but obviously things are going to go so much better this. Now, this attempt here, I was wrong. I've got a birthday present for you. Disco vehicle. Do you know what your birthday present is? It's the same birthday present all your friends get. All right, let's do something legit. We're going to try a supercar death. Okay, that's a new license plate. Normally he's not quite that, like, forthcoming with adjectives. Oh, this is working. Oh, this is working. Oh, it's working. First try, baby. Oh, the supercar all day. I should have picked this in the beginning. I thought I was going to have a problem because of the undercarriage being so low. Not so at all. Big jump flag. Ow. God. Oh, I lost my door. That's okay. We can do it once. We can do it again. It oh, yeah, look at it. Slender, okay. Narrow. Agile. That hurt pretty bad. I'm not going to lie. Okay, well, already. It's great that I have a convertible. You're doing great, Supercar, okay? You're doing less good now. Come on. Come on. That couldn't have been a fluke the first time I went through, I complete this thing and legit. There is no way for me to make this a second time. Hold on. Never mind, never mind, never mind. We got it. We got it. We got it. Fine. It's fine. No. Oh, Supercar, don't fail me now. I am going to have such an unbelievable headache after this board is over. Not just from getting bludgeoned repeatedly by Rocks in the face, but because this first challenge is insanely difficult to get past. Picking a supercar while at first seemed like a great idea, turned out to be a nightmare. All right, maybe we should pick something that can legitimately jump over Rocks. All right, I've had enough of this. We're going to hold on. No. Okay. It did pretty good for its first try, though. Maximum speed. Jump it. Oh, okay. So you can jump most of the rock slide. Jumping rock slides is kind of lame, so we're going to try and do the rock slides legitimately. Hold on. Got you. And now a big jump. Got it. What happened to my hood? My hood just yeeted itself off of the car. We got, like, a new personal best here. And you're leaving me. All right, what else you got? Carousel rock slide. I don't know what that is. Ow. Does the carousel follow you? It's like a heat seeking circle of, like, bludgeoning it's all right. Getting to this point in now is pretty easy in this thing. One, because, yes, you can jump most of the original rock slide, and two, it's just so fast you can outrun a lot of the problems. Okay. So the carousel follows you, and then it just beats you upward and downward. Okay, so God like a nonstop beating. Luckily, most of my vehicle is made out of, like, a roll cage, so it's not that bad. But no, it knocks you off, too. You have no idea how annoyed I am right now that doing this the legitimate way is starting to work. Better than just trying to jump over all of the look at this. Than just trying to jump over all of the rocks. Michael Bay rock jump. Go. Ow. Just got RKO'd by a rock flippy jump for the carousel rock slide. I have no clue what I'm supposed to do here, so I'm just gonna try and go as fast as humanly possible. That didn't that didn't work. Oh, and I'm on fire. Now. If you're seeing this, I made it past the rock slide, and I lost. Basically the entire body of the vehicle this time. It's like a roll of a dice, man. Sometimes you roll sevens, and sometimes you roll snake eyes. Sideways jump. The sideways jump is definitely oh, God. The sideways jump is definitely the way to approach this. But sometimes you can just get lucky where you kind of aim up for and you can get past it. Okay, we're doing terrible. I just found something else out, too. That red circle that's following me is a slowdown strip. Not only am I constantly just getting disassembled by these rocks, but the platform that's attached to them also slows me down, man. Oh. It hit me back on the platform, and then it hit me off the platform. I love that. It gave me hope, only to immediately rip the hope away. We're doing all right. Well, there goes the hood. I was going to say we just have a couple of dents on the hood now. You can't see the dents, though, because the hood. Is simply gone. Oh, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. This is all the slowdown stick. Oh, no. I am running out of ideas on how I want to get past the carousel. Of course, I go through the fence, too. Oh. There is nothing quite like getting repeatedly backhanded by a bunch of rocks. This is a fantastic metaphor for my life. I'm trying this forward. I'm trying this backward. I lost my front grille. I think my car is on fire, too. Well, that's just a bunch of oil pouring out of my car. Oh, no. My car is also on fire. All right, well, I think this is a good opportunity to try a new vehicle. I'm actually kind of surprised that this thing hasn't blown up yet. I mean, I've been sitting here waiting for did the grill fall from the top and then cause it to explode? I think it did. All right, we're just going to tank the damage. I've had enough. Tank? Yeah. Gun. Okay. Armor power. Go ahead, hit me. Hit me. You can't you can't hit me because I'm too pat. Look at that right there. Bounced right off. No big deal. Push that rock aside like it's nothing. This is incredible. I I can't believe how good this thing is. First try, right through carousel. Not afraid. Okay, slightly afraid now. Way more afraid. Super afraid. Oh, my God. I'm right there. Come on, help me. No. That could have been awesome. The armor can definitely take the hits, though I will tell you what, it even retains its mirror finish after a couple of repeated bludgeonings. So go around. There we go. Okay, here we go. Okay, now slow. I was going to say, if you stop and you let the carousel go past you, you can kind of like oh, yeah. Oh, God. Ascend rock slide. I don't even care. Finally, I got past the carousel. Oh, it's just like it's the classic rock slide. This is the your stone, normal, like, base issue thumbnail rock slide right here. That hurt. And now I'm dying. Big jump. Ow. Big jump. Take two. I don't know how I dodged all those rocks. Every single rock there looked like it was two inches from me. Oh, one of the rocks is stuck. Oh. I only have to deal with three rocks. Oh, this is my chance. My chance for salvation. No. Don't you do it. There we go. No. The triforce of rocks. Oh. Make the bad rock stop. For God's sakes, make the bad rock stop. This is unbelievably. Ridiculous. I'm starting to think that the first time I made it past the carousel hold on. Was a fluke. There we go. Okay, ascend rock slide. We're just gonna punch it. Go. God. Oh. Okay. Maybe punching it was a terrible idea. Okay, we're gonna so that oh, no. That seagull just gave his life for the rockslide board. You'll be missed. I guess you mostly just want to you want to physically dodge. Okay. They come down pretty fast. This run's looking great. This run's looking terrible. I am so close to getting to the rock slide. I have been stuck in this corner. There we go. I was stuck in that corner. Oh, for God's sakes. I have to try and pop this thing out of the little crevasse that I'm stuck in. Come on. There we go. No. Oh, yes. Hey, now. Nice. There we go. So back to the ascent. Rock slide. I've tried this fast. I've tried this slow. I don't know which way is better, honestly. Well, now just kind of do 100 barrel rolls there. That's a good way to start things. Aim this up. And now we're going to go over to the whoa. Okay, so the rocks get ejected at you. No, I'm right there. Don't you do this to me. Yeah, got it. Ascend rock slide. Finished. Completed. Is this another one? Oh, my God. It's like, twice as big. It's like, twice as long. And I think oh, it's thinner, too. And it looks steeper. I think this is oh, God. Mud. Oh, wow. This is way steeper. Anxiety. Close the door. I'm still no. Hey, guess what? Don't bleed on my car, all right? We're gonna try the gray mobile. This may do incredibly or this. This may go real bad. I really don't know, because it can definitely climb over the rocks with no big deal. But it can't take the kind of damage that the other cart can. It's also freakishly fight. The entire bottom of this board is just a car graveyard. Okay? Roll cage protected me. That's pretty good. Oh, yeah. Okay. There we go. Roll Cage gets a little scuffed up, but that's not too bad at all. Oh, my luck is feeling good here. My luck is feeling good. I only got hit a couple of times. Well, I got hit the wrong long time. The time that mattered, you could almost say rock slides are pretty brutal. Not going to lie. Whoa. And I kept the. Or if I was to be pursued for an assassination attempt by both a pothole and a rock slide. I think I would rather be pursued by the pothole because it has a lower chance of murdering me. I know this now from doing this a lot. I have seen this carousel way more times than I care to admit because oh, wow. Oh. Because I'm so narrow, I can kind of look at this. I don't want to turn sideways. I want to go straight because that's where my narrowness is a no, my narrowness is a benefit. Oh. The tears of gray still play as water. Los santos. I'll tell you what, it's so many tears. Yidas. Yeah. That the crops. Are you're going to growing real good around here. Look at that. Vehicle is looking pretty good, too. We got a slight dirt in the rear corner panel, but two of the rocks. Aren't working for some reason. I really don't know why. Maybe they're just on strike or they've been drinking. And that means that now I just have to deal with the ascending rock slide. So this thing's grip uphill is pretty good. So hold on. If it's as long as I can get some traction to begin with there a little bit of forward momentum. Now we can turn. Great. Look at this. Oh, yeah. Big dodge right there. Jump over. It got past the first section, stinks the landing no big deal. Now we have to go up this gigantic sled of purgatory. We're going to try a combination of speed. Here we go. And oh, yeah. Dexterity. Oh, God. That rock is really wide. Please don't. Oh. Oh, this run is doing great. See, if I keep the camera facing toward me, it's like you have to keep your eyes on the rock. See, like one of the one of the statues from Doctor Who. We're almost out of this. Come on. Nice and slow. There we go. Okay, so if you have a ton of patience, you could probably just wait out the rocks and only go forward when their little jumpy bean thing that they do it's on. Cooldown. So to speak. Like a World of Warcraft ability. So going to go back over to the middle. Oh, wow. That shot me across the entire board. Oh, my God. Oh, this is going great. Yeah, that's sweet. You can see from the top of the roll cage we've done fairly well at minimizing the damage, so now it's just a matter of not getting stuck on that rock, first off. Whoa. Don't lose it. No. Oh, you can do it. You can do it. You can't do it. Oh, wait, hold on. Maybe you can. No, you can't. You think you're better than me? Oh, you can you can punch a bird out of midair. I don't think I ever knew that. Well, that's going into a mythbusters. So I figured I would try this car, because it has the boost attached to it and it's really small, you would figure that would be a fairly good combination. It doesn't have a ton of pickup off the line, but it's got the pipe reinforcing to the entire frame, and it has these grenades on the back, which means absolutely nothing because it doesn't provide any benefit on this board. But look at that. The tiny package has a look at that. Look at the distance it gets. The tiny package makes such a small target, and I could jump over most of the carousel. Nice. We're just going to plow through this. We're just going to wow through all this. Watch this. Going to boost through it. Doesn't have a lot of mass, though. Okay. So we're going to start at the bottom, boost our way up. There we go. Okay. Oh, no. It's it gets hit really hard by the rocks. I don't know if trying this was a trap, because it feels like it would be good, but, man, it just gets blasted by the rocks. I guess this is what happens when you don't have a big surface area to hit, but you don't have a lot of hit points either. Things like the glass cannon of cars. It's like the gnome mage of the GTA D and D crossover world. Okay, this run has been going fairly well. Haven't really gotten bludgeoned too much. And now we can time our go. There we are. Okay, so we can time our go with the boost in order to get past the carousel. That's not too bad. Now, that was a great start. Now, to get through this, we can utilize the boost. And I don't know when these things get shot down this roadway. Tachyon blats. There's no way to get around them. Okay, this is good. All right. Sweet. We haven't lost too much of the car, and we're already on the gigantic rock slide. Now, I've never gotten past this. God, no. Yeah, go. Just do it, Gray. Just power through. No. All right, you win. I'll pick a different car. All right, we're going to try the rally car. This thing's really close to the ground, so I don't think it will perform well at all. But I might as well just give it a shot. And when I say a shot, I mean I'm going to try this, like, three or four times. And if it just gets bludgeoned the whole time. It just gets lobotomized by the back alley surgeon that is these rocks. I think I might have to try a new car, but there's only, like, a few left. Oh, this is a terrible idea. We're done. Ow. God, I pray to God that you're the chosen one, because all of your brethren are dead. Captain's locked. Bryce still plays, has gone through the carousel for the 5000 time, but we're getting there. Ascension, here we go. I will ascend well. I'm going to ascend without my bumper. Oh, wow. That's probably the best I ever did on the first. Ascension. Ain't too bad. So second one dodging the rocks. Definitely the way to go. Now, fortunately, the rocks go down a lot slower here. See? I say as I get immediately murdered. Oh, this is the best run. This is the best run I've had. I know it doesn't look good because I'm missing my hood, and, like, the car has gotten the crap kicked out of it, but just the fact oh, God. That I'm hold on. Oh, yeah. All evasive maneuvers. All evasive maneuvers. Oh. Whoa. I almost just got, like, triple tagged by every single rock in the tristate area. But it's okay, because I finally got past the second ascension. Yeah, what a pain. Also, good thing I didn't just shoot off the top, because wow, this is really steep. My God. Stalking rock slide? You have got to be kidding me. Oh, no. It's like my own personal rain cloud. But instead of rain, the forecast is death. So how fast does it stalk you? Okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, you know what? I can kind of wall had this no, never mind. I am really sad that that just happened, but I can get to this point. Oh, this car is the chosen one. Oh, this car? The chosen one. And I'm getting pretty caught. I'm getting pretty good at the ascension. Climb over here. Look at this. Oh, yeah. Right there. All the way to the top. So here's the plan. We're just going to blast through this. We're not stopping. We're not slowing down. We're not taking our time. Go. Ah. Obliterated. Right away, man. I may be back at the beginning, but that's fine. All of this is look at that anguish that I have already endured. Also hold on a second. Real quick. Is there a bird that is inside of the concrete? What is happening here? What kind of glitchy best poltergeistic mess is it? That bird is just he's stuck. And he is part of this board now forever, I guess. Wow. Okay, you know what? Let's just get back in the car and get out of here before one of these rocks sends me off the board. A big jump at one time. Nice. Ho. That was clenching. Oh, God. Oh, don't do it. Please, God, just oh, no. Oh, I got saved. Okay, I just need to find a way to get my front tire back on. Maybe if the platform can spin around and I can get this hot. Oh, God. Really? Of course. It sets the car on fire, and then I'm immediately able to get on top of that segment there. This makes this is totally fair. I love it. Okay, well, at least I didn't finish it, because I would have been really annoyed if I was burning and managed to get past the carousel. Okay, here's the. Him. I'm at the stalking. I'm at the stalking. Landslide. We're gonna do this. I was gonna say, we're gonna do this. Top down. But that was clearly the worst idea I've ever had. Let me have this. Oh, my God. Let me have this. Oh, it's letting me have it. I'm out running it. Just barely. Yes. That means that we have a winner. Finally. Hey. I love rocks. Well, I outran the rock slide, but I didn't outrun the agony. Anyway, folks, hope you enjoy this episode of GTA. Till next time, stay foxy. Much love.
