All right, we're checking out the only game where the best way to ruin It's GTA! So Alex has created- Three different boards, the first one the second one with cars, And each board, the water is- This is what happens when I try Oh, actually, this still counts. So each board and each section So now it's half a foot deep all of his different ridiculous traps and tricks *laughter* while the water keeps getting deeper. I just noticed because I got- Because I get yeeted up here. This counts, right? Oh, All right, so- Are you serious? Oh, I think I just got water spouted, too. So you can see he has given me just a mess of... Well, I say all motorcycles. I think there's a quad in there or something. But there's- Come on! Yeeeeet!!! So now we're in the pink. You can see there's So obviously I can't touch these or I'm Depth 1.5 feet now. Did he spawn these? I think he spawned these. I don't think they're supposed to- Oh the shotaro to legitimately drowned... Really? because the shotaro is drowned. So he said that the vehicle that makes it is the- Where- Where did it go? Oh my God, no! I've lost a second vehicle, All right, well, so much for the scooter. All right. How about this? This looks kind of low, so but the engine sounds really good, I can't really say I've ever tried to ride All right, so we're going to go up- All right. I'm gonna need as much speed I'm assuming you have to... I was going to say, either Oh, come on. Just go. Just go. Go. Go. Yeah, we're. Nice. Okay, so now watch out for the teleporters. There. Watch out for the jet skiers. Are they like heat seeking jet skiers? Because it kind of looks like they're Is that a helicopter prop? Oh. Oh. All right, You go ahead and squeeze it around the.... I think I just flooded out the motorcycle. I kind of gotta know. Well, these props kill you. Props will totally kill you. All right. This is fast. It can pop some sweet wheelies. So I think this is going to be..... Ow! I think this is going to be a good one. Now, hold on. Now, he said I could beat this any way I want using any of the vehicles, so..... *manic laughter* *manic laughter resumes* For a second there, I thought for some reason it was holding me back. But no. So could I totally beat it Is this just something cool? Oh. Did he put a failsafe in here? Yeah, cause... Depth two feet. Okay, so go around the prop. Oh, he put a failsafe All right. Good for him. All right, who's my next victim? I like an enduro style bike. You know, this is used I don't know if that's really a verb Oh, my God. So now I just have to get past the props, and then we get to see So let me get past this prop. Teleports back and forth. So now! There we go. No problem. 2.5 feet. So this is the purple section. Okay. Still works. Still working, good. Looks like there's guys Got to put some snorkels on this thing. It's still driving men Who's screaming at me? Did this just flood out? There's an arrow right there. That's got to be the end. All right. If you want speed. Got to use- Oh, yeah. Ummm... Yeah this side. Go! Heyyyyyy! I saw I went over here, As long as it's not And as long as it's not inside- Yeah. Okay. I was gonna say, as long as it's not inside the teleporters! Okay, it still works. It landed on dry land, so we're good. Ahhh! Uhhh.... You know what? This is got to be it. Yeah, keep that engine warm- Keep that engine warm, baby. 2.5 feet. Just go. Just go, Gray. Go, go, go, go, go, go, Nooooo!!! wow this thing just- We haven't tried That's what- So they're not really four wheel vehicles. They're all three wheel vehicles. So I haven't tried I can tell you in life, when I was a young These were like known for breaking necks. So I have a feeling either this is going to work I don't know if I can pass this. All right. Still doing okay. It's unbelievably slow. So. But that doesn't matter. It's not a timed board. It's just how far I can get through Two feet. Can it take two feet? Yep. Still working in two foot of water. Doing okay. 2.5 feet and still working. Okay. So I'm officially farther So now we're in three feet. So now we're in the red. Okay, this is the first bike Oh, this is happening. Well, I guess that one technically made it, too. It's up to my hips now, and it drowned. I am running out of options. Pretty soon all I'm It's going to be fine. It's not fine! It's not- I died. I- I'm- I'm desperate at this point. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Three foot! Working great! 3.5 foot. I lost the engine. I'm literally right there. I'm using a BMX bike for this board. Oh, my God. Please don't send the BMX Yeah, I'll be screwed. Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!! I have no idea what happened there. Bike, bike, bike. Don't you leave me. Now, the good part is, when it goes You know, because it's a bicycle. the pedals, bike Do you ever try and pedal a bike in a foot or really three and a half feet of water It's a godd- It's a good leg workout. This is this is why you don't skip leg day. All right. Two foot area. Ummmm... I mean, I can still pedal it. Okay. 2.5 foot. I can still pedal it. It's still working again. I never really intentionally tried But is this really going to be They could have made it three feet It's doing just fine this whole time. The BMX. Three and a half feet deep! It's still paddling, though. It's just torture. Now you can, on a BMX bike, you can kind of like hop it every once in a while. If you can time it just right, you can get Not in the water, though. *gasp* You may be saying to ourself, &quot;Gray, have you literally just been bunny Listen, I got to this point. I'm not giving up. I am right- Come on! Yes. Oh, my God. Yes. Let this happen. Is that a teleporter? Oh, yes. Oh. Onto the next board! Okay. Starting depth. This one foot. And now we're using off road trucks and cars. And this- And this- I got to- because it's so stupid I need to know if this could. Are those human beings being vaulted by jet engines again? Ah, it- It works in one foot! It really does. Okay. How about two feet? There's no way this is going to work in I love that Alex has now created He has now created a cannon This goes in two feet! This is incredible. Oh, no. I lost the engine. I mean, it's here. It's a four wheeled vehicle, I can't imagine this would get Okay. Depth three foot. So we're already at three feet There a way for me to cheat this? I mean, he said if I can- So you get over here into the canal? Oh, I flooded out in the canal. All right, I'm trying the buggy. This is made for end of the world Now, he also said that he gave me hydraulics because it's impossible But I don't actually think this thing's hydraulics do anything And it flooded out. We're going up. I have one of these in real life. I have gotten through So this this has got to work. All right. So we're going to go up here, then we're going to see if I can squeeze I can I can kind of He put this right here. I can kind of cheat most of this. Okay, so it goes straight I died in the four feet. This can definitely go At least I have, but I also snorkel mine. Deep! This is literally called deep. I haven't even been looking But usually Alex puts important It doesn't really fit through- All right well- On no! Can I get back to the course? I don't even know Oh, no, I totally can. It's Oh, boy. Set me right back. All right, it's fine. We can still- *gibberish* I can't believe I lost that vehicle What if that was the- Whoa! All right. What are these divers eating? Like my breakfast consists of cement I got the BMX bike. All right. Listen, Okay, so that means there is totally- Now, will it take me 4 hours Probably. Probably. But I'm not giving up. As long as this doesn't send me You can see right here. Oh, thank God. I mean, this is so sad right now. The BMX bike has now I'm still trucking. All right. Still truck- All right. Well, I try to use it to be So we're going to- All right Canis! Pee. What does he have to do with anything? All these divers are going to kill there. Okay. I made it past the divers. Fantastic. In the red. Deep in the red. Canus is still working good. No problems doing great. Depth? Five fee?!? Oh, well, it's yellow and I'm yellow, Like, it can still do this, right? Because we're- It can't do this. Pee. This is where this thing dies. Thanks, Alex. I'm Straight up. This thing's got some height. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Well, so much for the Wienermobile. You are literally my last hope. YOLO. That's what it's called. YOLO. Oh, my God. If I get- If I get knocked off here, Oh, thank you, Jesus. Yeah. I can't fit it in here. Well, you know what? I guess I could just drive over this. I've got hydraulics. It's like, uh... It's like nature's speed bump. See? Yes. Seaworthy speed bumps. He said any way I can get across, alright? How much is your boat worth to you? I would have parked it The YOLO mobile is incredible. The YOLO mobile is going to do this. Excuse me, everyone. For the purposes of testing, No other car has made it there. There we go. And perfect. No one was harmed during the making Not a single person. By the way. This totally works in the yellow. This is the most powerful one so far. So now I have to get without them pushing my car out Out of the way, boat! Okay, so- What is it? *laughter* Okay. Okay. Six feet deep. All right. I've got the hydraulics going. Let me show you something, These go back and forth. That one goes back and forth, too. Because you can't really see it I mean, you can, but it's not easy. I almost went right into the water So we're going to back up And we need to get this perfectly.... Oh, just enough time. So now there's buoys. There's literal buoys. I'm having to go around 6.9 feet. Really, Alex? I'm riding this thing. Like a cowboy. 6.9 feet. Let's do this. Just going to- I kind of figured you could go Oh my God!!! Yes!!! And we have a checkpoint! Welcome to the deepest of the deep. Now it's heavy- This requires lots of patience and IQ. I don't have either of those! Well, thanks for your confidence, Alex. It starts at three feet?!? Okay, so there's an arrow. And what is that? What- So there's a lot of heavy machinery here, What is this, anyway? Oh, the sherp's here. This thing floats. This thing straight up floats! This thing will go through water, Cheat death. It's called cheat. You could just cheat the whole board Okay, let me show you. Watch. Watch this. It goes in the water. And then because the tires are so buoyant, So what was that, like, five foot? Six foot? I didn't even see it. Oh, this thing drives like a dream. This is no problem. 11 feet deep. What? Oh, my God. I can't. Oh, there's a checkpoint. So then there's... This platform- I don't think I can. Okay. I just- I need to see this. And then there's a breakaway All right, before I call Alex, How did you make it? Okay, it's pink, So it's driving in three feet of water. No big deal. So now we go down Oh, it works, but there's nothing for me All right, how about something like this? Oh, yeah. I'm already at eight foot deep. This thing is still rolling. 11 feet deep. Oh, wow. Okay, this is. This is kind of legit. Oh, it just flooded out right here. All right, Rust Bucket, how far can you make it? So we're coming past the blue Uh.... Oh. Oh, wow. I- I didn't know there was another one. 14 feet deep. Oh, yeah. Okay. This is the highest thing It's slow. We're in 11 foot So now we're going under 11 feet. Okay. Still going. 14 feet deep. I don't think it'll go any further, I don't know if you can see the wheels I don't even know what this is. Do I need to carry a car? I feel like I would have to carry a car with this all the way to the end. It's the only idea I have. I mean, it goes to the 14 feet like this and it still runs. I don't know how this is working. 18- Oh, 16- It is 18 feet?!? I can't tell. There's a boat. Hold on. I got to try something. I got to try something. *laughter* 16 feet. Okay, so it's 16. So this can... This can get all the way Yeah, this is definitely the key. Okay, I think I know Okay. Trust me on this. I got. I just. Just trust me. I saw that there was It didn't make any sense at all why there'd be two. Right? So I think one is supposed which you're supposed to use- which is supposed to You'll see when I try this. Just hold on. So now and we're going to put winner This may be overly elaborate. Oh, my God. Oh, wow. This thing went a lot Okay, let's try and There. And now we're going to drive this thing Okay. Like this. Check this out. Okay. Now, I'm gonna take this. He said I could use all the cars, And we're going to bring this Okay. Now I'm going to take this... Okay. And we're going to Kind of like I need Like, probably here. That looks good. We're going to jump All right. You ready? Boom! Ye!!! Okay, this is this is totally working. I feel like I'm doing way more steps than this needs. So now I'm going to drive this out- Actually, I want to clear out this I do not want that thing in the way We're going to back this up. This is a this is 1 trillion IQ. Unless it doesn't work that I'm going to I'm probably going Get inside the car. Also, if this goes in the water, There you go. Oh, God. Oh, all right. It's. I mean, it worked. and we're going to raise it up just enough so that it's not under water This is working. This is totally happening right now. Okay. 16 feet deep. We know this works. Yes. Oh, my God. My abs. Okay. Now I just have to slam it. Well. Raise it up. And then watch if we can slam this thing, Come on. Just rock off. Come on baby. Get- Get out. We're going to squeeze it. See watch. Watch. And then... And then- Yes! Oh, that's perfect. Okay. Okay. This is working. The things I do to beat a GTA board. This is one of those instances I will hate myself to no end. So we're going to go annnnnnnd Yeet! Oh, yeah. Oh, this is a good yeet! This is a good yeet! And we have a checkpoint!!! Oh, God! Okay. Okay. I do see the end. Here Gonna do a hard turn- Oh my God! Oh my God! Whoaaaaa!!!! It actually shook me out of the car. Okay. Uhhhh.... I wonder if that curve is too harsh You can slow down a little bit After what I've been through today. A little. A little ribbon ride is nothing. All right, well, it's not nothing. I've been through a lot. Okay. Yeah. All right. So you just have to do it slow. But I need enough speed to keep my grip. Are you ready? Okay, Arghhhhhhhhh!!!! Okay first- So I'm learning. Exact- Ahhhh!!! Man! ...exactly how much speed I need It is very finicky. You really had to give me just to get the final ending, Okay. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Wall ride. I can do a wall ride all day. No problem- And we have a winner!!! Yesssss!!!! Well, I drank more water Anyway, folks, hope you enjoyed this episode of GTA.
