Thank you. Way beyond well-worn. &gt;&gt; Is it torn or faded? &gt;&gt; It is torn and somewhat faded. &gt;&gt; It is pure lottery. Vendors don't know exactly what they will find in the bundles they buy. &gt;&gt; Are there good days and bad days? &gt;&gt; Joyce is sorting through her own morning pile. &gt;&gt; Look at the colors. The bright colors. &gt;&gt; We have to reduce the price. &gt;&gt; We are looking for a stretched waste. &gt;&gt; Some days she says she discards up to half of these close. &gt;&gt; Throw it in the dustbin. &gt;&gt; Do you know what happens to it? &gt;&gt; Some people and people have used it to light fires. Fuel for some of the fires at a vast dump site where electronic waste is incinerated to recover metals, like copper. But much of the textile waste lands up in lagoons and waterways leading into the atlantic ocean which sends a lot of it right back to to the shore -- -- to shore. Thirty-four year old fisherman rahman botchway told us the nets cast from boats gather a lot of rubbish alongside fish. &gt;&gt; We are collecting the rubbish. &gt;&gt; Is one more headache for communities already struggling with unpredictable weather conditions and large commercial fleets that leave very little for small operators to catch.and -- to catch and fish mongers like Mariam abubakari to sell -- to sell. &gt;&gt; This is nothing. &gt;&gt; It's obvious to see the physical and visible pollution along these beaches with the textile waste. What's less visible but equally as consequential is the sheer volume of micro plastics and synthetic fibers that is in all this waste, stuff that will never biodegrade. &gt;&gt; Have high levels of polyester. &gt;&gt; Liz Ricketts started the nonprofit here inattempting to repurpose or up cycle waste, creating new products like this fiberboard and other products. &gt;&gt; An average of 20 tons of textile and waste on a weekly basis. Every week, that is replenished. &gt;&gt; Ricketts is American and spent years in New York and London as a designer in an industry that she says has become a breathless high-volume business. It went from two seasons a year to five with garments sewn cheaply in low-wage countries. &gt;&gt; Is striven on a scarcity mindset that tells you you're not going to fit in or not have that second date. We are pulling up our phone and see if there is something. They're access is about my middlemen exporters. &gt;&gt; We reach out to the American apparel and footwear association that said the industry wit -- would support policies and regulations to encourage textile to textile recycling and the infrastructure to support it. Another added no one in the industry is intentionally making that will go to landfills or developing countries. They referred us to a group they support called accelerating circularity, formed five years ago, it has launched a number up or up, promoting a so-called circular economy, more reuse, less disposal and proper recycling. &gt;&gt; The idea would be a ghost somewhere where it's adequately recycled. &gt;&gt; But the university of California professor who studied the waste industry says recycling will not come close to solving the problem? &gt;&gt; Fast fashion, you're talking about how to switch off the tap. &gt;&gt; Get people to buy fewer clothes. &gt;&gt; Fewer close, better made, have people repair them, but it's partly changing people's mindsets. There has been a shift. &gt;&gt; Ricketts since is a shift in mindset not just in consumers but in the fashion industry especially given the increasing visibility, the climate and the environmental consequences. &gt;&gt; Most of the brands have said we hear you and we understand this is a thing we ultimately need to be doing but they are afraid of being the first brand to do it. This is not going to change overnight. &gt;&gt; At the same time, she says she is not calling for a ban on used clothing and ports that clothing on imports -- to ban clothing on imports. &gt;&gt; For decades. &gt;&gt; An environmental journalist we hired as a consultant remembers walking along pristine beaches here just two decades ago. And, like most ghanaians, his family bought secondhand clothes. In the past it was good business for all the traders and even the general public here. People would go to the market and buy things that would last for decades. &gt;&gt; At kantamanto market, Joyce asiamah yearns for a return to that time. &gt;&gt; Ghana is not a dumping place. They should not bring it here. We want quality things, nice things, stylish ones. &gt;&gt; Some U.S. States and the European union have begun or will begin requiring garment retailers to Colle and recycle used clothes. The system will be modeled on similar efforts at electronics retailers, who add a recycling fee when goods are purchased. Currently, just 20 percent of discarded textiles are actually collected.
