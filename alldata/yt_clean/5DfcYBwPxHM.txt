[Episode 01] So, you're a PR manager. PR for short in English. Public relations. Problem resettlement. I've seen your interview. Resettlement, that's how you identify your career. I love solving problems. How is that? Solving others' problems spares me from my own ones. Have you thought about this? The problems you're involved in will haunt you forever. Tell me what happened before you passed out. It was Tuesday. As usual, a phone call woke me up. Was it midnight? It was one p.m. Such a long sleep. I had stayed up late the night before that day. You had an irregular daily routine. Routines, just like rules, are made by men. - Whose call was it? The talk show host who cheated on his wife? Right. His call always comes with big troubles. A video about Geng Yue dating an anonymous woman comes out. I've seen it. Within an hour after Geng Yue checked in with her, the clip spread rapidly on the internet. By the time I arrived at Sofitel, it was 1 hour and 40 minutes later. I don't want you to help Geng Yue. You can't save him. You just get nominated as the Most Valued PR Expert of the year. Don't get involved in the affair of this love rat. Don't forget to introduce me to your new boyfriend. I'd love to buy him a meal and check if you two are suitable. Every time we talk business, you start to mess around, change the topic, and make fun of me. Back to the business, then. Who are we? Not again. Recite! We're problem solvers. We're here as a solution, not a judgment. We protect the interest of our clients at all costs. Clients are the first priority. Never cast aside. Never give up. We do our duty. We solve it ASAP. Rational and calm. Faithful and honest. Good job. Don't you think Principles of Weizhe sounds narcissistic? Shut up. 150 million yuan from Pengkun Fund went missing. And the founders' whereabouts are unknown. It has aroused many concerns. Relevant department has started an official investigation. Many investors rushed into Pengkun Fund's building and asked for cash. However, the office is already empty. Some raging investors got to Darling International, a company with Jiang Yuanpeng as its president. They demanded DL to take the responsibility. See that? Look at us. We've turned to the target of public criticism. What's President Jiang doing now? He's gone missing since yesterday. We can't reach him by Wechat or phone. Even his wife doesn't know his whereabouts. Could he be arrested? It's 150 million yuan that's missing. How could he be innocent? We should stop worrying about him. It's a personal affair. He should take his blame. We, DL, have nothing to do with his own fault. It is easy to say that. You may say we're irrelevant. Now Pengkun Fund is frozen. With Du Shaokun and Jiang Yuanpeng missing, the shareholders won't be pacified easily. Maybe our accounts will be frozen soon. Now all the customers and competitors are aware of the risk we're facing. This is a big trouble! William. You sound excited. What for? Taking pleasure in the misfortune? Not at all. I'm a partner of DL. I have my share in DL. Do I sound excited? I'm anxious! If so, take your responsibility as a partner! President Jiang's absence won't stop DL from functioning. I'm still standing here! I'll contact the media. What a great show! What's wrong? Didn't you hear that? Du Shaokun and Jiang Yuanpeng are deserters. Darling International gets set up. I remember DL turned you down. Right the opposite. It's their loss for not employing me. Did you invest in Pengkun Fund? I don't have the money for it. But I heard someone had invested 2 million yuan. What about now? It's all gone. Stop gloating. You're better than that. Go on. Wei Zhe? Where was I? It slipped my mind. What's in your mind now? Pengkun Fund. [Stella] Did you found Pengkun Fund together with Du Shaokun? Yes. But he's in full charge of the operation. Do you know where Du Shaokun is now? I don't. I'm looking for him, too. There is no money on Pengkun Fund's account. Do you know where the 150 million yuan is? I have no idea. Now that Du Shaokun is missing, you're an insider, please cooperate with our investigation. Isn't it funny? We feel lonely when on our own. When there's a company, we can't adapt to it. If there's a third one, troubles will definitely arise. Ring the bell. Why do I have to do it all the time? You're my assistant. What if the man answers? It must be the woman. One Michelin-starred meal? Make it two. Who are you looking for? You. I don't know you. I'm Geng Yue's friend. He just called me. Let them in. It took you so long! Wait, who is she? My assistant. What's happening? It's only been two hours. The whole world knows it! How could I know? So early for a date. So brazenly for an affair. You're asking for paparazzi. But... we've been careful enough. To protect us from being exposed, Lulu chose the covert path. Where is your car? Parking lot to the east of the hall. Parked at the end. Which car? Audi A5, silver. Plate number. Hu A77755. Wait. Are you here to help or to investigate? Just skip the conversation. Shall we? Wei Zhe. How about this? You make an announcement to the press, saying Lulu and I are here for business. Her boss is planning for a variety show. And they want me as a host. We're here for discussion. What a nice place for discussion! I suppose it wasn't in the living room, but in the bedroom! Who the hell are you? Don't take the media as a fool. They won't believe it. Why are you leaving so soon? Look around. What's going on? No idea. Can we start? I can't wait. Look at the time! I'm sorry. Do you want your job or not? Tian Lu. Please get changed. Off you go. Give me the room card. What for? Do as I say! Where are you going? I paid you to solve my problems. Now you're gone, what should I do? Shut up. Stay here. Excuse me. Excuse me, room service. Wei Zhe. I start to doubt your judgment. Look at the assistant you hired. She's not qualified for a PR career. You can't imagine her attitude towards me. Shut up. Stay here. I wonder who's the celebrity here, she or I. I checked the parking lot. From your car to the hotel gate, you didn't have to walk past the two cars parked by the roadside. Why did you take that path? I told you before. Lulu tried to protect us from paparazzi. That's why we took the other path. Spare me the useless lecture. It's a most urgent situation. Weihze. No matter what you do, I can't afford to get exposed. But you have been exposed. I mean... I don't want any more photo of me walking out of the hotel. Otherwise, this marks the end of my career. It's too late. Dao Ge from TT media disguised as a housekeeper. He's searching the floor room by room. Within 10 minutes, your room will be blocked with journalists. Holy moly! What to do? What now? What should I do? See that? Too nervous to hide his dialect. You have a glib tongue. Now you're stupid like a pig. How dare you! She cursed me! What the hell! Come on, let's fight. I dare you to touch me. Shut up! She just broke up. Please forgive her. No wonder she's dumped. Mind your own business. Wei Zhe. Shall I head to the airport? Hide in an island? Or a secret place in the mountain? They are not where you should go now. Where shall I go then? Home. Where's Tianlu? [Clifton, Sydney, Australia] Molly. I'm by the sea. What? See the house now? Dear, my vacation just started. Tell Edison, my call-back fee is doubled! Miss Tian. Once you leave the hotel, please come with us and hand in your phone. Do not contact others for now. And keep a low profile until the rumor is defused. Why would I? I've got plenty of work. Do as I say. It's vital for both you and Geng Yue. Are you implying a detain? You can't restrict my freedom. Don't you know who I am? Listen carefully. For Geng Yue, this is a major crisis. I'm the first one to rescue him. My importance to him speaks for itself. I'm his crisis management consultant. Now that Geng Yue entrust me with such a duty, would you please trust me? But I promised Yuanyuan to show up on her birthday party. - Who? - Who is she? Molly. I'm going to pick up the client. Could you pass this to Jiang and get her to meet me there in 40 minutes. No problem. Hold on a sec. Molly. I'm back. Which one is it? This one. The one nobody would buy. The big house. Talk to her. Why does the dirty work always go to me? I hate the work as much as you do. I want to save my face, too! Shut up. Tian Lu. We will give you an offer if you cooperate. We will not only help you through this crisis, but with your comeback afterwards. We will customize a promotion plan for you. We'd contact resources and do whatever we can to pave the path for your star dream. What if I refuse? If you refuse, or agree to our face but act the contrary, I promise you will be the most isolated person in this affair. No one will speak for you. All your friends and family will look down upon you. The media will laugh at you. Even Geng Yue will blame it all on you. Stop bluffing. Wherever you go, you'd be exposed immediately. Even on your way for shopping, you'd be cursed by the passersby. With no PR team helping you, you can only witness how the entire world spit on you and look down upon you. I'm not bluffing. I'm just telling you the truth. You won't be the first one to get entangled in gossips. Nor will you be the last one. You know I mean it. Geng Yue is a famous host. His wife, He Jun, is awarded the best leading actress. Even if their fame collapses, they still got funds, resources, and the company of each other. What about you? You've got nothing. So, behave yourself. Do as Wei Zhe says. Do you promise to promote me? Go after the man you spoke to. He's Wei Zhe. If we cheat you, expose him as you like. What's going on? No one is caring about me. I'm the one paying you, not her! What should I do? Right now, there's only one thing left to do. What's that? Wait for dusk. Look up the one who released the videos. Is it necessary? There's enough evidence. Just do as I say. Report to me in 24 hours. We got a huge, beautiful property for you to look at today, Mrs Qiao. It should suit all your requirements quite nicely. Jiang, do you want to introduce the house? Okay. It's got six bathrooms and eight bedrooms. Two large gardens are located at the front and the back. There is a large swimming pool at the end. It should suit you. It looks nice. Is this the biggest house around? Let me check it out. Is this the biggest house? 100 percent. The largest in here. Okay. My boss said yes. Great. - This way, please. This is the saloon. Over here. It's part of the study. The dining hall is here. Big enough for a party with dozens. That's the pool I mentioned. This way. Here is the kitchen. Through the passage, you can see the bedrooms. These are all made of woods. The cloakroom is right here. What's this place? Well... Follow me, please. Alright. Here you are. It's a bathroom! Large enough. What? Bathtub. I know it. Looks nice. Having a sore throat? Jiang, are you finished in there? Coming. It's a nice house. I'll take it. It's 10 million Australian dollars! I'd say think twice. It's only 10 million Australian dollars. Such a nice house would be much more expensive in China. It's now or never. The estate doesn't wait. Besides, I've got no time for calculation. I'm going back the day after tomorrow. You'd better think it over. What are you guys talking about? How do you like this house, Mrs Qiao? He asked if you like this place. Of course! I like it. Very much. I'll sign the contract today. I give you money, now. - Wow, fantastic! A moment, please. Madam, I must warn you. The hostess committed suicide in that bathtub. What? That's the difference between humans and animals. An animal may eat whenever hungry. Run away once fed. Sleep if exhausted. Then wake up for the next meal. It can do whatever it likes. But it's not the same for men. From time to time, we have to bend our will. What makes you think so? We often misplace ourselves. Our positions are relative. Once we lost it, we'd feel embarrassed. Then we'll be overwhelmed with social contact. So, where is your position? Like I said, it's relative. What kind of problems do you solve? Many. What if a fuse burns down? Let's say if it burns down and you can't get the one you need, the right one is thousands of miles away from you. If you have to get in within 24 hours or the entire city will blackout, that's when I come out. You're humorous. A professional skill. Sorry to interrupt. It's recommended the patients avoid using phones in counseling. I've emailed you the NDA. Have a look. What do you mean? My presence here and our conversation must not be disclosed to others. I stick to my integrity as a therapist. Integrity? In my career as a problem solver, I've bought several therapists off. And they repaid me with evidence Seems to me, a contract works better than integrity. [NDA between Wei Zhe and Lingzi Mental Health Center] What the hell was that? You work for me, right? Isn't that what I pay you for? You suck at your job. You know what, you don't have a job. You're fired. Dalin. Why stop her from buying? She asked for it. It's not your business. I wanted to walk away. I just can't help... Now what, you said it as you wish. And you got fired. What should I do? I can't afford to witness it. She paid over 10 million AUD for it. And no one informs her of the story. She's Chinese! Our compatriot! But it's your job you lost. What are you going to do? Where there's a will, there's a way. See you around. You can always ring me up. Keep your head down. Don't look around. Aren't they Geng Yue and the woman? Have a look. That's right! It's him! Geng Yue! Follow me! Keep up! I told you to stay here. See? We missed him! Stop talking. Hurry up! Lure the enemy away. Nice work! To be honest, I regret it now. How can I be so reckless? We're men. It's hard for us to control... Speak for yourself. What is it you regret? Cheating or getting exposed? Both. How long have you known each other? - Who? Well... a month at most. How did you meet her? Is there any other way? Parties, of course! Wechat, scan code, private group. The usual stuff. What do you know about her? What am I supposed to know? All that happened between us was on the king-sized bed. [Yueru] It's me. Where are you? Don't bother asking. I need to hide for a while. What's going on? It's a long story. Just bear this in mind. I have nothing to do with Kunpeng Fund. I must find Du Shaokun. Only he can prove my innocence. Why don't you tell me? I can come with you. You're on your own now. You can't look after yourself. That's not important. There are two things for you to do. You must do it now. I'm listening. First, ask Linlin to come back. Second, go for Director Qiu and Director Lan on your own before Linlin arrives. What should I do after finding them? Once you meet them, recite the words I'm about to say. I'm warning you. If He Jun forgives you this time, I'll keep on helping you. Otherwise, this marks the end of our contract. What are you talking about? Wei Zhe, you must be kidding, right? I'm the fish in troubled water. Is it about the money? I've paid you plenty for your work this year. Money again... Enough. Get to the topic. Name a price. I won't bargain with you. I can't do it. If He Jun doesn't forgive you, your reputation will collapse. Contact me again if you want a comeback years later. Renew the contract then. Come on, are you my buddy? You promised me to behave yourself. Do you take me as your buddy? Of course, I do! It's not my fault. It's my image as a nice man to be blamed. It's firmly rooted in people's mind. Now I know what it means by the burden of fame. I was only messing around with the model. Why did you bring him home when there were paparazzi waiting? He must go home. At that critical moment, the only forgiveness Geng Yue needed is not from the media or his fans, but from his wife, He Jun. It wasn't like this when He Jun and I got married. I don't know why. The longer we lived together, the more estranged we feel. I don't know if it's her or me that's changing. Or both of us are changing. Why am I saying this to you? You're a celibate. You know nothing about women! Thank you, David. If it wasn't your help, I'd been applying for benefits tomorrow. Spare me the formulae. You're going to do something more for me. I'll buy you a meal tomorrow. Alright? Cheers. Stop joking. I'm a professional headcounter, you know it. I make a living with it. You're in a lack of qualifications. You can hardly get a job. This one pays so well. You should pay me with agency fee. How much? Two thousand. Seriously? Two thousand. Are you crazy? The choice is yours. Think about it. It's a hot position. I may just give it to somebody else. - Deal? Mom. I'm thinking about calling you. What's wrong? Linlin. I've booked a flight ticket for you tomorrow. Get home immediately. Tomorrow? What's wrong? Don't talk on the phone. - Just do as I said. Okay. I don't want this job. You can keep it. Bye-bye. What for? Get out. We haven't arrived yet. Turn right. I'll bet you the gate is crowded with paparazzi. Sit here if you want to be exposed again. What should I do? You're keeping dogs, right? Get out. Could this be him? Mr. Geng. Excuse me. Move aside. Clear the way. Hello. Whom are you visiting? Liu Fugui in Building No.1. You're here for President Liu! Get in, please. What's going on here? So many journalists. Disperse them. Stop gathering here. Alright. Yes, sir. You can count on me. Thanks. Please leave here. Go away. Two endorsements and four ads has been suspended. Geng Yue. The two hours you spent cost He Jun 50 million yuan! Those agreements are signed by He Jun and me together! It's 50 million for her. I've lost more than that! By the way, who are you? Sorry about it. I've got a baby brain. Let me introduce myself. I'm Lin Na, Miss He Jun's new PR consultant. I'm in charge of all her PR affairs. Are you? No one asks me for permission. Stop talking. Nice to meet you. I believe we share something in common. I'm nominated as the most valued PR expert, too. Congratulations! What for? It must be a shady deal! Shall we talk in private? Geng Yue apologizes first. Then transfer all his media accounts to us. We will write and update all the posts. Geng Yue can apologize first. But He Jun must make an announcement soon after and forgive Geng Yue. We take care of their accounts and posts separately. Geng Yue will apologize. You may write the post. But we must confirm the content before updating. He Jun will remain silent for some time. She'll have a trip to Australia. He Jun must respond. Otherwise, Geng Yue's apology will be useless. The trip is acceptable. But she's not on her own but with Geng Yue. No wonder, all men are bastards. Who are you talking about? Isn't that obvious enough? I can expel you out any minute! Shut up! My client will not spend the holiday with your client. No woman will travel with her husband who just cheats on her. She must be crazy! Really? You're the crazy one! Mind your language. Which part are you suggesting? Is it cheating or the holiday? What does He Jun want? What? Now that he has cheated on her, what does she want as a reply? To make peace or not? To forgive or not? To divorce or not? Well... That's to be considered. It depends on how he behaves. Alright. I understand. He Jun. Listen to me. I'm sorry. It's all my fault. I don't beg for your forgiveness. Don't forgive me. Bear my fault in your mind. You'd better hate me. Only then, can I make it up for you with the rest of my life. Only then will my confession make sense. Only then will I learn it the hard way. Get lost. I'm reading scripts. One more word and I'll call the police. I'm begging you. It's a fight I can't lose. We hired Wei Zhe as our PR consultant. When did He Jun hire you? An hour ago. You paid for Wei Zhe. He Jun doesn't trust him. I know you're not willing to talk to me. But I have to do this. It's my job. Tell Geng Yue to prepare for divorce. It's not what you want. I checked your schedule today. You returned home after dinner. Yet you still have your makeup on. You didn't take it off. Or maybe you have cried, but you don't want others to know it. So you put your makeup on later. What are you waiting for? Go on. And there's the script. The left side is heavily marked. It could be your habit, highlighting your lines for reciting. But I can't see a single marker pen in your room. So you weren't reading the scripts. Or you keep staring at it, but you're in the mood to read. I hate such consistent and conceited behavior of yours. I've never heard about you. Where are you from? You'll know it soon or later. My specialty is in investigating cheating, home wreckers, and gossips alike. How about cooperation? If I were you, I won't but all my eggs in one basket. I only trust Wei Zhe. As for you, I'll never pay you! Wait and see. I remember you and Geng Yue first appeared together on the movie gala five years ago. Back then, Geng Yue was the host. And you were the best new talent. You two were on stage together. Even though you weren't side-by-side, the way you looked at each other looks just like a couple. Later, you two went for a reality TV show. You went to the countryside. The rain was pouring down. And the path was filled with mud. Geng Yue carried you on his back. You two only got a bowl of noddles till dinner. Geng Yue said he had a stomachache. You said you had the trots. These were all excuses to save the noodles for the other. That's enough. Recall the past suffering, that's how mediation starts. That's how you remain true to your original aspiration. He Jun. In your journey of life, how many true love can you find? And what's the chance of marrying? You and Geng Yue made it through. Happiness is the fruit of the hard time. How could you delete those sweet memories from your life? Wei Zhe. Make it clear. Geng Yue is the cheater, not me! The blame is on him. He tore our life apart. Then he begged for forgiveness. Why would he do that at all? Why should I forgive him? I won't! You're right. Geng Yue is wrong. You can punish him! Either economically or psychologically, just say it. I'll agree to it for him. Please tell me, what do you want? I want a divorce! Say that again. I want a divorce! Divorce! With him! I hear it. Please let me know when you divorce. How is she? Come on. What do you mean by silence? Any words? What's wrong? You don't look well. I feel sick. That's not funny. Why did you stop persuading them? You'll drown if jump into the sea. Then why jump at all? She's trying to walk out of the disaster. Why should I hold her back? What happened next? Then I went to a pub. It was midnight already. Why didn't you go home? I used to finish my day with a drink. Just to relax. I live by myself. I feel lonely at home. Do you know Pengkun Fund? Du Shaokun has gone missing. Jiang Yuanpeng disappears, too. Jiang's absence is bad news for DL. I heard that he goes abroad to find his daughter. His daughter? How do you know it? My boss is a victim of Pengkun Fund. What else do you know? I know that you will buy me another drink. One more drink? I can't drink anymore. Sorry. Stingy. When the seed of time sprouts, the scenery outside the window can be seen clearly. The breathing is even and careful. Those burdens weighing on mind become secrets. When the memory is recalled gradually, there are so many trivial formalities in the world. My life is like a journey in the wind. Insignificant but gorgeous. Only powerless expression left. In the dream. In the dream. Flowers fall off in the rain of time. Listen quietly. The words have lost power. The bell ringing. The low whispering. Who left the traces unintentionally? The breeze is still gentle. In the dream. In the dream. Flowers fall off in the rain of time. At one slight stroke, the dawn turn the night over. Whether it is right or wrong doesn't matter at last. There are so many beautiful stories in the world. Gentle but cruel. In the dream. In the dream. Flowers fall off in the rain of time. Listen quietly. The words have lost power. The bell ringing. The low whispering. Who left the traces unintentionally? The breeze is still gentle.
