I want to talk about the decentralization of truth. Thank you, Elyse. You gave me a How many of you are in Bitcoin or in Okay, maybe about a fifth of the audience. This is something that keeps happening. If you keep going to these events, you will notice that a Why? Because we are growing at an exponential pace. The entire community, the entire industry, is growing at an exponential pace. Most of the people who come [to these events] are new. Here is how it works. You come [after] you have A lot of people come in through Bitcoin You start asking questions, and none of it &quot;Who runs this thing?&quot; &quot;Nobody.&quot; [Laughter] &quot;Okay, &quot;You have been in this space since 2012. &quot;How does it work? What is it backed by? All of these questions come in, and you [think], &quot;This isn't None of the answers make sense at first. But it is full of traps because you [think you] see the 'I'm having this breakthrough moment. I can finally 'Barely, just a bit.' You reach that peak and [think], 'I made it!' It is just a [brief] plateau and &quot;Okay, I kind of understand Bitcoin, but now I am hearing More questions about that, and then altcoins. &quot;When did this happen? I just understood Bitcoin and Here you go again, climbing up the steep learning curve. Just when you [are beginning to understand] altcoins, that allows anyone to [launch] an ICO in three minutes; Here we go again. &quot;What the hell are these things? No, they are [tokens on a blockchain with] &quot;What the hell is a smart contract?&quot; Just when you are beginning to understand [tokens], &quot;Okay, I have that covered. At least I understand that.&quot; &quot;Wait, what do you mean it is forking?&quot; [Laughter] &quot;Do I get part of the fork? If I have the fork, am I on &quot;If I am on both sides, how can I spend [coins]? &quot;What, it is forking again? Didn't it just fork two &quot;How do I get this fork? What about the next one? &quot;What if this is a bottomless forking mechanism? &quot;Maybe I missed this. Are we ICOing Bitcoin now? In all of this, you are trying to find an anchor; something that will give you a basis to understand And [there] is [a] trap. We have grown up believing The model we have for discovering So when we are [desperately] trying to figure out what do we instinctively do? Instinctively, we look for an authority. &quot;Hang on, Andreas said this is a leaderless movement. &quot;How the hell do we find out Inevitably, someone pops out of the bushes I'm sorry, but we weren't advertising a vacancy when We want it to remain leaderless. [When] you look at all of these [coins], some people Is it Bitcoin [with SegWit] that is the real Or is it Bitcoin Gold, or whatever the next fork [will] be? &quot;Can somebody tell me which one is the real Bitcoin?&quot; There is no final authority. There will be no answer. No one can tell you because We are so [accustomed] to looking for someone Why do we need to know which one is the real Bitcoin? [Well], if one of them is real, that is Value comes from authenticity - or does it? &quot;What's in a name? That which we call a rose / What is in a name? Is it authenticity that gives it Where does the value come from? We don't know how Let me give you a question here. It has a stamp on it, some fancy serial number. Or mark it with a marker, &quot;this is a real dollar.&quot; What does it say on the front? Does it say &quot;one dollar&quot; It says &quot;Federal Reserve Note&quot; [at the top]. The [dollar] in your wallet is an imposter. It is essentially Those days are over. Now it is a &quot;Federal Reserve Note.&quot; Let's play a little mental exercise. [Imagine that], overnight, all of the dollars but nobody seems to notice except you. You know they are forged, and you know But you can see them handing [each other] forged What happens to the value of the system? tomorrow morning, all of them were forged? Nothing. It continues to have the exact same value, It doesn't matter who printed it. What does it matter? It doesn't come from authenticity, it doesn't come If we use the thing, then it is the real thing as far as The value comes from the use. It is not valuable [The stamp] is only about making sure You only care about it being authentic because you at which point it [would] start losing value. What happens when the authority [stamping it], is the Now we have a bit of a conundrum. When you ask yourself &quot;which is the real Bitcoin,&quot; The problem with looking for authenticity is, [usually], You need someone to step up and tell you which and which one will keep its value. No one can tell you that. The only Bitcoin that If you are running a node, you choose That is the real Bitcoin to you, and [maybe] you alone. There is no objective truth, only empirical [How] do you know that everybody else is making The market takes every single person's subjective and then puts a price on it. [The market] collects all of the decisions you make, and at what price to sell and buy. [The market] creates this emergent picture of value. 'I don't know what the real one is, but this is what people The ideal way to maintain the &quot;real Bitcoin&quot; is to run How many [people] in this room do that? Most of us delegate this decision. We think, professes to share my principles and values, following then by proxy I am expressing my opinion about This is not just a problem in Bitcoin. By show of hands: Ethereum, Classic, As people who are indoctrinated to authority, we look &quot;Sue those bastards for trademark infringement!&quot; That is old-school thinking. That is the basis of old Here's the bad news: we would [easily] have our and the others simply went away or died. it would be fantastic if the real one, emerged as In order for one to win, something [must] None of these things [will] ever disappear. As long as there are two people running the There are coins from 2012, the very Nobody knows what they are anymore, but they are We have a thousand blockchains today. Then we will have a hundred thousand, etc. Because somewhere, probably in a cabin in Montana, there will be the one [of the last] die-hard users They will say, &quot;This is the real one, and you That one will exist forever... There will be no winner because this This is not game season, this is not the World Series. This is a system in which everybody [could] choose There will be thousands, hundreds It doesn't matter which is the real one. There is We [must] become accustomed to uncertainty. The only thing that matters is The value doesn't come from it being [a Use value is the only value. Then you realize that all currencies are like that. None of them matter in terms of authority. It turns out that the euro, the yen, and the U.S. dollar but because we believed, and they will Even that authority is fake. It is an illusion. All that matters There is no authenticity. There is no objective truth. Here's the danger: people are very uncomfortable that they can cling to and say, &quot;This is the real one.&quot; But they will never get it, so they will They will say, &quot;Let Coinbase decide.&quot; &quot;Whatever fork they support is my There is a very dangerous moment when companies forget that they serve their users, They did not receive a [blockchain] electoral mandate in consensus or be their elected They serve customers. They are Over the last couple of years, we have watched that to believing that they had a mandate to represent their and impose those decisions on everybody else. That is a very dangerous path. It is the path If you give up your responsibility to choose based on just like giving your keys to someone else, You are no longer participating in consensus, no longer You are delegating to central authority. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Do not make the mistake of looking for a who will tell you which is the real one. They are all &quot;real.&quot; They are all &quot;fake.&quot; Which is the useful one? Which one expresses your principles, Is that real enough for you? Follow that and You can express your choice. There will be no winners. But together we can ensure that, by making by [participating in] consensus when but we will put in our little two cents (or satoshis), and hope that the market reflects that. We can have something that persists, that is neutral, open, and empowering for individuals. [We can have something] that cannot be easily hijacked.
