MATTHEW: James and Owen you each get three tries cause this is your last letter. and you just have to hit in the blue circle, even though Oscar went above and beyond and hit the bullseye. MATTHEW: That's one. MATTHEW: Oh there you go, you're still alive. MATTHEW: OHHH He got the bullseye! MATTHEW: This is unbelievable but they're still in the video. MATTHEW: Tommy broke the board. MATTHEW: Colin's now trying to make it into the mini hoop from up here. OSCAR: On the bounce. Oh on MATTHEW: This is another special shot where you only get one try, but that means they only get one try. all he's doing is a layup. okay made it they only have one chance to make MATTHEW: Okay. They only have one chance to make it. MATTHEW: Oh boy Colin's doing it. If you miss you get a letter. MATTHEW: Three tries Owen and he's back here. OSCAR: You gotta get it. MATTHEW: Come on dude.
