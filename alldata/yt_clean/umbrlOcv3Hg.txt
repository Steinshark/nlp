[Adum] -So, this is a beautiful film starring Shia LeBeef. [Scoot] -So, we've done every movie that Taylor Lautner has ever been in. So, are we moving on to the Shia verse now? What's the plan here? [Gael] -They're wearing strange hats that's so you know it's like, not America. [Scoot] -ooh is this Arabia? [Gael] -It must be... [Gael] -He's wearing like, Aladdin clothes. [Scoot laughs] [Adum] -All right- [Scoot] -Yeah, &quot;you&quot; can say it... [Adum] -Steven Spielberg is to Shia LeBeouf, as Michael Jackson is to Macaulay Culkin. [Scoot] -Oh, they're good friends of different generations? [Gael] -They want to fuck each other? [Scoot] -Gael, we're doing a fucking family show here! [Adum] -Oh my god... [Scoot] -We're trying to watch Eagle Eye, God Dammit! [Alex] -Yeah but I'm trying to pay [Scoot] -Oh, that was the first drone! This must be the beginning of the Obama administration. [Gael] -I don't think it's a good christening, the first drone... [Adum] -Michael Chiklitz. [Scoot] -He's like five foot six, 250 pounds, zero percent body fat. He's the best man, he's a choad of a man. [Adum] -He was my best man. Yeah, this music is hilarious! [Group cheering] [Gael] -All right! It's a movie about drones, I think. [Scoot] -It's a movie about drone bombing peaceful Muslim weddings. [Alex] -Oh my gosh... [Adum] -This is a shit drawing... Wow! Wow, that wasn't it that was a [Scoot] -You did it! You're the one! [Adum] -That actor just had his breakout screen time moment. [Gael] -I think he's the murderer, that's why they're all looking at him like that. [Scoot] -Or what if he's the dead one? [Gael] -That dead one! [Scoot] -Oh, this is a cry! Quivering lip... drops of glycerin falling out of his eyes... [Gael] -Wait, he is the dead person, I think he's a twin. [Adum] -and then he's going to find out his twins alive or something... [Gael] -His twin was in the CIA I got him all over this film. six months without a boo or a bar huh [Scoot] -Boo bah! [Alex] -Boo bah. [Laughter] [Alex] -Did you ever see that kids show [Adum] -What? [Alex] - It's fucked up... [Gael] -What is that? [Alex] -You've never seen Boo Bas? [Gael] -No... [Alex] -That's when you got it- [Scoot] -Not as a kid, but... I learned to appreciate it, that's about it. [Alex] -Go on and google Boo Bahs. [Adum] -I like how to scare music starts when someone who isn't white shows up. [Scoot] -I was going to say that yeah, the first non-white shows up and you get strings playing in a minor key... Wow that's like half of my checking That's pretty good, Shia [Gael] -But yeah, it just throws like three quarters of a mill. [Scoot] -Yeah, 750 000 in 20s. Is that a 55 gallon drum of lube. [Adum] -Oh, how do you know what that looks like? [Scoot] -Shut up, Adam. Let's talk off camera, later... [Adum] -Camera? [Gael] -Let's. [Scoot] -Hold on, are we not on camera? Can I take my shirt off? [Alex] -You're wearing clothes. how'd you get this number? [Adum] -How'd you get this number&quot; It's the fuckin' FBI! [laughter] this is all some kind of sick joke. I don't know what I'm doing here. [Scoot] -Like, in acting? That's not fair... That was me, you know what Shia, I'm sorry. [Clip] -your Miranda rights are my right to keep you in this room as long as I want to. [Scoot] -Um so does Billy bob not understand that Shia is white? [Gael] -Yeah I don't- maybe it's the beard. [Scoot] -He's talking to him like he's not white and it's making me uncomfortable as a white person... [Clip] -Would you risk your life for your son? [Scoot] -No, I've never been particularly fond of him... [Adum] -Oh, that's not mcdonald's The arches too, good product placement... damn [Adum] -Man, I want a big mac... This is great. [Gael] -I love it. [Scoot] -Joke's on you, he's not my son. I was faking. [Adum] -I like a movie where I recognize actors and I'm like, this is a worse performance than you usually do. [Adum] -You know? I'm like Rosario, you're not usually this bad- Billy Bob you're not usually this- [Scoot] -this is low end for you guys. [Adum] -Yeah there's something- directors matter, you know? [Alex] -Yeah yeah... [Scoot] -Representation matters, Adam. [Alex] -It really really matters... [Gael] -Oh I see, the crane's gonna go through the window... [Scoot] -No... [Adum] -It's just there for no reason. [Laughter] [Adum] -You! What?! Come on! You're dead... [Gael] -There's no way a crane would do that much damage to a building... [Adum] --Jump jerry Shaw The train, what if there's two trains there at the same time do they really like, yeah whatever... [Gael] -There's no way... There's no way! [Alex] -Oh my god... [Adum] -So did they, they drugged this man, right? [Scoot] -That man's dead. That man's been dead for 2 hours. [Adum] -Oh! HAA! I don't need to know anything more... [laughter] [Gael] -What if this is just like U.S. intelligences competing with each other? [Scoot] -I love it! [Gael] -Like, it literally just is the CIA on the other side- [Adum] -They worked with both agencies in this film and they were sending different drafts of the script- [Scoot] -and whoever funded them the most gets to win? [Adum] -They could- they kept a little bit of both. [Alex] -This is like the watchdogs movie. Remember that game? [Adum] -I guess so, yeah. [Alex] -Yeah, it wasn't good. [Adum] -Oh fucking god... [Scoot] -Hey guys look at Jerry! [Adum] -Not a single person had their phone on silent... Maybe she hacked the phone. [Gael] -That's funny. [Adum] -Oh my god, this is literally the same music as World War Z! Like, there's that point that I danced It's the exact same fucking- it's not literally the same song but it's like you know what I mean... [Gael] -Yeah, oh I know. [Alex] -So generic... [Adum] -It's the same! So fucked up... I can't believe it. Editor, make the comparison. [Scoot] -Editor, do it. Don't be a coward, editor. [Adum] -and find the thing... show boat... [Music] [Gael] -Oh it's Speed, now. [Adum] -Yeah exactly... 50 mph. [Adum] -Just hack the car! [Gael] -I'm surprised they haven't yet. [Gael] -Wait, she is hacking the car! [Adum] -Then why didn't you do that before? Why are you telling her to do anything? [Adum] -Why are you even giving advice? [Gael] -She's hacking a manual vehicle... It's not even an automatic vehicle! It's got like a clutch; how are you gonna hack the clutch on the car? It's just- it's just the lever. I'd love a wide shot just- [Scoot] -No no no... [Alex] -Yeah, that's the worst type of action. [Adum] -They haven't invented them yet. We call it close action, it's implied action, but you don't really get to see it. [Adum] -Uh, who's doing this? [Gael] -I can't wait to know who- [Adum] -Is this like, and automated- [Scoot] -It's been hacked... [Alex] -Remote overide... [Scoot] -Yeah. You know how cranes had wi-fi in 2007? [Music] [Adum] -Are you over water? Where are you? [Scoot] -Yeah, that's actually news to me, also... [Scoot] -Why will they drown? Okay, here's some water guys... [Adum] -I think you should have shown... [Alex] -What? [Gael] -No, that would have been helpful to the audience... [Clip] -She could probably derail the train she's probably trying to train with- [Adum laughs] [Scoot] -Okay, do that... [Adum] -Yeah do it. [Alex] -Yeah, that's what I want to see. [Adum] -She could pull off aoc. [Scoot] -Very much so. [Gael] -Though Billy Bob could pull off probably more than half of the senate. [Adum] -Yes. [Scoot] -&quot;Hassad instruments&quot; I don't Not. One. Bit... Oh thanks, Michelle; you figured it out... [Alex] -How did they not see that coming? [Gael] -It was a very quiet truck. [Scoot] -That van really snuck up on them. [Scoot] -It's Hassan! Get him! [Gael] -Do you like that? He said &quot;I'm American&quot; [Scoot] -Jury's out, friend... I think we'll let 23 and me be the judge of that... [Gael] -Okay... [Adum laughs] -Her voice is so annoying... [Gael] -Oh! [Adum] -Really? We're gonna get a final destination right now? Did you hack that? [Scoot] -We're gonna do we're gonna destroy the power grid of Texas. [Adum laughs] [Gael] -Oh my god! [Adum] -That was so funny! [Scoot] -Oh. My. God... [Adum] -That was amazing... This is a good movie. [Scoot] -Hassad we hardly knew you... [Adum] -I can see why people like this movie. [Alex] -That was yeah, that was the best part yet. [Gael] -If they can do that, why do they need Shia LeBeouf's help? [Adum] -I know! Why were they telling them where to drive if they can hack the car? [Gael] -They can literally kill anyone- [Alex] -I can't believe how seriously they're taking this... [Scoot] -Very... [Alex] -It is so dumb. [Scoot] -This is serious business. [Gael] -How do they do that? [Alex] -Come on, escalate the stupidity. [Gael] -I like how the department of defense when they bug somebody's house they put a giant modem... with property of department of defense right on the lid. [Group laughs] [Clip] -Yes? [Laughter] [Clip] -the Americana death toll now stands at 56. [Gael] -Oh, that's actually a lot. [Scoot] -That's a lot of Americans. [Adum] -Yeah. [Scoot] -That wouldn't be a lot of- [Adum] -that- that's high of arrogance- [Gael] -That's what I meant. [Scoot] -Yeah. [Gael] -That's like a thousand Iraqis... [Adum] -Yeah... [Scoot] -Minimum? I think you're under shooting. [Alex] -Do you feel like some kind of reveal? [Adum] -Yeah, I mean she's gonna betray him she's gonna be in on it or something. [Gael] -There's no way... [Gael] -She's too- [Gael] -She's too frantic... Wait... wait! [Adum] -I like how that metal latch that wasn't attached to anything electronic, just- [Adum] -How many shells you got in there? [Scoot] -Two, as per shotgun rules... [Scoot] -Look, just cause- [Adum] -Like, what does shooting that camera accomplish? You didn't shoot the recording... You shut- like, you you ran past the camera- they saw you already... [Gael] -They should have blocked its vision with balloons. [Adum] -Yeah. [Scoot] -I do like a balloon block. [Adum] -Oh my god, that guy was from Tim and Eric in the background! [Adum] -This is the fuckin' guy with [Scoot] -He's got a beautiful set of pearls! He's got oh my beautiful set of pearls! [Adum] -That was totally him! Editor, you have to show that. [Scoot] -Oh my god... [Adum] -What do you do at this point, when everything is hackable? [Adum laughs] -just hack the bus like what are you gonna? How do you- how do you know you're safe at any moment? You don't. [Clip] -Scramble whatever you can. [Adum] -Eggs. [Adum] -Did they bleach Rosario for this film or what? [Scoot] -Adam... [Adum] -She seems- [Gael] -Wow, she is actually- [Adum] -Like I'm just g- [Scoot] -This is- [Adum] -I'm not- I'm- I'm saying it as a criticism of the film... Like, this is- it's weird... [Gael] -Well I mean, she's a good guy in this film so- They have to have to whiten her up a bit... [Adum] -Wow... [Gael] -So, you can contrast her with- I mean, that's probably the logic we- [Scoot] -We don't want her looking like Hassad! [Gael] -Then they'll think she's a plan- [Adum] -Tt would confuse the audience. [Scoot] -Wait, she's a good one? [Everyone laughs] [Clip] -Welcome to eagle eye. [Scoot] -He said it! [Adum] -Yay... [Scoot] Da da da da da, da da da da da da [Adum] -Did they make this whole video animation for him? [Gael] -They did. [Gael] -Someboday at the FBI had to edit this. [Scoot] -Someone spent hours on this. [Adum] -United. For perfect union. [Adum laughing] -This is so weird... [Adum] -You're a computer! [Alex] -This is the twist, right? Hey, kid stop all the downloading! [Adum] -So, the point of this movie is to say technology has gone too far... [Gael] -So, she like can see everything, because she's in this hive type thing, where all the cameras give her data. [Clip] -Different from Ethan in every way except one. [Adum] -You're gay. [Laughter] [Scoot] --The twist, the reveal, he was gay the whole time. [Gael] -Can someone- why is she here? Is that- [Adum] -I don't know why she's here... that she's gonna be a bad guy... it's gonna be a twist or something. I don't know. [Alex] -Oh man no the chemistry is... she's carrying- [Scoot] -Chemistry... [Laughter] [Alex] -I have a horrible feeling this stupidity might have peaked... [Gael] -No, there's no way. [Alex] -Is it- how can it get dumber than that pylon thing? [Scoot] -Well, I'm giving- [Adum] - More awesomer. I like how she- HAHA! She... she let it go all the way past and then brought it back! [Scoot] -Wait a minute... and then the computer got hacked- [Gael] -Hold up... [Adum] -That's so silly... [Alex] -Is it going to be like Toy Story 2... bag scene? The hacking... [Scoot] -So many slides, this looks fun as hell! [Alex] -Yeah, this does look like great fun here. [Adum] -Oh no... yeah we're in the main frame now... That's not a box! [Scoot] -Now we're a box! [Alex] -Okay, here we go... This is what I was waiting for. [Adum] -ERROR. [Alex] -Is this the climax of the movie? [Scoot] -Sure? [Adum laughing] [Scoot] -Also, there's no way there are this many levels of slide... [Adum] -Why'd you leave the gun? [Scoot] -At the airport... [Gael] -Yeah, it's very uh... like a- [Clip] -Injections will lower your heart rate, reducing your need for oxygen to a 92 percent chance of survival. [Adum] -You have a 92 percent chance of survival. [Scoot] -Good numbers. [Adum] -But, you have an 88% chance of permanent brain damage... [Scoot] -Sure. [Clip] -Your son is? [Gael] -What? [Gael] -What a weird question to ask someone. [Scoot] -I wanna meet that son. [Alex] -Is your son handsome? [Adum] -Is your son legal? [Alex] -What? [Scoot] -Oh! So, he IS handsome... [Gael] -Can you imagine? [Scoot] -Interesting. [Gael] -Can you send me that picture? [Gael] -Oh, she said &quot;zee&quot; [Scoot] -Nice... [Adum] -This is America... [Alex] -that's a fucked up thing, yeah. [Scoot] -Wait, I need to get the last two letters! It's fire extinguish something... [Gael] -Why would the computer need this kind of UI where it just says everything that it's doing to itself, like- [Adum] -In case someone's watching! [Scoot] -Maybe don't tell Eagle Eye how to do HER job okay, Gael? [Gael] -I'm ready for them for the computer to like tell from the vibrations in the coffee cup what they're saying... I swear to god, that's where that was going... oh my god- [Everyone cheering] [Adum] -That's not how wave forms work... [Gael laughs] [Adum] -After I got detained for my first and last name... because some other Adam Johnston was on the most wanted list... that had a different age, different height, different eye color, different middle name, and all that... After being detained for that, I can believe this movie... [Scoot] -That has happened to both my dad and my friend- [Adum] -said I was potentially armed and dangerous. [Scoot] -Yeah. -Yeah... [Adum] -Yeah, all this all the security people at the airport were giving me like, terrified looks. I was like &quot;Oh&quot; [Gael] -Again, why is she here? [Scoot] -But now, step back to Jerry Shaw and give him a little smooch. [Alex] -We got another review coming in? [Gael] -It seems like it might be... [Alex] -Like, nothing has developed with them I don't understand... [Scoot] -Do we know anyone's motivation? [Gael] -Yeah, they're explaining her motivation. He wants... she's frozen, she can't do anything because his twin brother like locked her biometrically... [Scoot] -Yeah? [Gael] -She's trying to unlock her potential. [Scoot] -and then do what? [Gael] -By- so, she can like become fully autonomous or something. By using- [Scoot] -Oh, she wants to be a real girl. [Gael] -I think so. [Scoot] -She wants to be a real though- [Gael] -I think it's the same it's the same plot as Bicentennial Man... [Scoot] -Okay, fair enough. You know what? Say no more; that actually explained everything! [Clip] -Repeat the sentence on the touch screen. [Scoot] -I. am. gay. No, I'm not gonna say that! Never! [Gael] -Wait, she's gonna kill a bunch of... She's gonna kill a bunch of U.S. politicians! [Adum] -fateful findings... [SCoot] -I think she's gonna kill the entire line of succession... [Music] [Laughter and cheering] [Adum] -Remember the thing I said would happen? [Alex] -Yeah. [Adum] - Like, 10 minutes through the movie... [Gael] -The day- she's gonna- she's gonna pull- no no no. She's gonna do the double double [Scoot] -Oh, but I love you! [Gael] -He's gonna be like ,&quot;I love you I'm not gonna do it.&quot; [Alex] -Yeeeeeeees..... [Scoot] -I like Jerry more than my dumb kid... [Adum] -Deep throat the gun! [Scoot] -I was literally gonna say, put it in your mouth and suck it! [Adum] -Spring break! [Scoot] -Make you REAL uncomfortable... [Gael] -I just want to say: just bring a hardened criminal; bring someone who's used to killing people. Brought like, a single mother! [Scoot] -Bring a murderer! [Laughter] [Adum] -Only mothers care about sons... or other family members... [Gael] -Yeah, I got it. [Adum] -She's gotta have that motherly instinct to want her son not- [Scoot] -My dad agrees with you. [Clip] -Jerry Shaw will be eliminated by other means. [Scoot] -Oh, so you didn't even need me to do that... [Gael] -Yeah. So, so far like two tasks and one of them like, right off- [Adum] -That's stuck... [Scoot] -Yep. [Clip] -16 hours ago a commercial explosive went missing from a testing site in Aberdeen. -Give me a ratio. -One crystal to a football field... [Adum] -Huh? [Gael] -It's like how much explosive damage it can do. [Adum] -What's the size of a crystal? [Scoot] -I thought it was like an- sat question... [Scoot] -A crystal is to a football field as blank is to playing. [Gael] -That's a good point he's like &quot;give me a ratio&quot; he's like &quot;a crystal.&quot; [Adum] -Like, that's not a unit of measurement... [Scoot] -Yeah. [Adum] -Crystals can be big. There's [????] of crystals. [Scoot] -A 75 pound crystal to a football field! [Gael] -I can't believe how convoluted the plot is... [Adum] -I don't know if anyone's supposed to understand this movie... [Scoot] -All right, so people will get this if they care. [Adum] -Yeah like, you have to be invested in the story for it to work, right? But, how could you possibly [Alex] -The story only works if you turn your brain off. [Adum] -Oh yeah, an instrument store... Rachel's kid plays the trumpet. [Scoot] -It's okay, they're dead now. [Gael] -So, Rachel's kid- the trumpet that Rachel's kid plays, is the frequency needed to set off this high explosive? [Alex] -Oh, they're actually he's gonna hit it... [Adum] -He's gonna hit the brown note. [Adum] -That's too big! [Scoot] -What?! [Adum] -That's a- no, the size doesn't make sense here... [Gael] -The wingspan on that alone... [Adum] -That's like okay... really?! Are you are you traveling at a speed slower than the cars?! [Scoot] -Yeah it's one of them slower- [Adum] -Did you did you set your plane speed to less than the car? [Gael] -To 50 miles an hour... What the... insane... [laughter] [Adum] -This is so weird! [Gael] -He's gonna drive into the drone. He's gonna like go on a ramp or something- [Alex] -Oh yeah yeah yeah yes, the sacrifice. [Adum] -What the whoo- [Scoot] -You got this Billy. [Scoot] -This is ALL you Billy. [Adum] -Oh What?! How do you do this?! [Gael] -That's even more insane! [Scoot] -Anytime you wanna make that written apology, Alex. Billy, you good? [Scoot] -That's a crystal! [Gael] -That's a crystal, she's gonna go to her son's- [Scoot] -she's gonna go to a football field because it's one crystal- [Scoot and Gael talking over each other] [Gael] -and then her son's gonna play the trumpet. Yeah, that's what's going on! Oh, I got it! it's a Presidential assassination plot! [Scoot] -That's a handsome son. [Gael] -What? I'm just trying to figure out like, what about his trumpet is going to be so unique that it's going to set off the bomb? [Adum] -He's very bad at it. [Gael] -also, is it going to make the trumpet out of tune enough that his concert master would notice? [Scoot] -Um... Maybe we [Scoot] -watch the movie and find out? [Gael] -Wow asked and answered! This movie's smarter than me... [Adum] -Good. [Gael] -Gotta love the the red eye; that's how you know she's evil. [Adum] -Oh no, my hard drive! [Scoot] -Oh, that's where my processing units are, in the big camera... [Adum] -Really? Really? That's like- [Gael] -she's not wet at all, by the way. [Adum] -It's a lens! Right? [Scoot] -Oh, she's a little bit wet. [Adum] -I'm sorry... what?! [Scoot] -Well, I think that's pretty self-explanatory... Next scene, please. [Adum] -They should have just done that from the beginning. [Alex] -Yeah, this is- [Adum] -Stab the eye... Have they hit a note yet that isn't- oh wait no, it's the top note... [Scoot] -Yeah, that's the big old F. [Adum] -Yeah. [Alex] -Count down. [Gael] -You gotta go down on- [Scoot singing] [Adum] -That one that always gets into the fail compilations. [Adum] -They already hit it. [Gael] -Tackle her son. [Scoot] -Just crush that boy. [Adum] -But, that's the same note as the um as the earlier part of the song... it's the same not though! They've already played the note. [Scoot] -Shut up! [Adum] -It's literally the same number they played later in the song... [Scoot] -We killed em. [Alex] -We're near the sacrifice. [Adum singing] [Adum and Scoot] -It's the same note... [Scoot] -I know just just shut up, just watch the movie... [Adum] -They really wanted to play almost the whole national anthem. [Scoot] -Yeah, we have to hear most of the anthem... [Adum] -This is that type of movie... Everybody stood up in the theater and held their hand to their chest. [Scoot] -Did you know after this after this opening weekend 10 000 people applied to the CIA? [Adum] -What an unsatisfying climax... [Alex] -Yeah, that was atrocious! [Adum] -Yeah, it was... nothing happened... [Scoot] -Ooh, rimless glasses, pretty cool! [Gael] -but like I just decided- [Scoot] -No, you need- you're a rim boy. [Gael] -I am a rim boy. [Scoot] -As soon as I said it, I felt weird... Kiss your dad! Or whoever that is... [Clip] -Is that for me? [Gael] -No, this is not for you. [Adum] -Yeah, we got the trumpet- [Scoot] -I brought this over to play myself and I will be taking it with me when I leave. [Gael] -Oh man, that's a bitch. [Alex] -Why is there such a emphasis put on her necklace though? [Gael] -Because, it's a bomb. [Scoot] -It's what was going to blow up when he played the note for the second time. [Adum] -Yeah, it was very silly... [Alex] -It's so dumb! I figured they'd just put a bomb in the trunk of it. [Scoot] -No no... [Cheering] [Adum] -It seemed like the activation switch for the trumpet was bigger than the bomb itself. Like, they could have just- [Scoot] -Just put TWO crystals in there. [Alex and Adum] -Yeah. [Adum] -Wow! [Gael] -Oh man.... [Adum] -What was your uh favorite scene? [Scoot] -Slides! [Adum] -Slides.. [Alex] -The pylon scene. [Alex] -That's where it peaks. [Gael] -That takes the cake, yeah... [Alex] -What else- [Adum] -Oh that yeah, that was fucking amazing. [Scoot] -It was a good zapping. [Adum] -I have to agree, that was amazing. [Adum] -I was almost expecting it to be the same composer as World War Z, but it doesn't matter they're just all doing the same thing... [Scoot] -Yeah. [Adum] -I'd like to hire someone who's going to make music that no one will remember. Uh... wow, yeah that was very [Gael] -Yeah there was uh... a lot going on... But, the way the computer got defeated was particularly anticlimactic. [Adum] -Yeah, what the fuck?! She just just stabbed the eyeballs... [Scoot] -She bopped them. [Adum] -before it was uploaded she was trying to upload it but they knew. [Gael] -Honestly I will pay any of you like a thousand dollars right now if you can tell me what she was uploading. [Adum] -Herself. She was trying to upload a copy of herself. [Scoot] -Ummm... [Adum] -You owe me a thousand dollars, that's- [Gael] -No, that's not- that's not- that can't be it... [Scoot] -I think that no she was uploading to 53 terabytes of child pornography to get it in trouble. [Adum] -You owe me a thousand dollars, Gael. [Scoot] -Adam and I are gonna split it, five hundo a piece. [Gael] -I'm picking up the Wikipedia article we're gonna check this...
