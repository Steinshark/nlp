From spills, to falls To straight up disgustingness, We're uncovering the many things that can completely ruin your day. I am one tired lady. Ahhhh. I'm definitely gonna need a couple alarms tomorrow. I'm a snoozer, what can I say. Let's charge this sucker up and get to bed. Finally, it's time to sleep! Ahh, yes. Uh, Sophia? It's morning time! It's not even eight yet, thank goodness. Woah! Since when did it become noon?! What happened to my alarms? But I plugged you in!!! Gah!! I'm so stupid! Why does technology always fail me?! OOF! As if this day could get any worse! Man, this really hurts! AHHH. I'm a little puffy this morning, huh? Some minty fresh breath oughta wake me right up. Isn't there anything left in here? Come out!! Gahh! Bring it up from the bottom, yeah. There we go! NOOOO!!! That was all I had left! Ugh. I guess there's only one thing left to do. Hahaha! Uh, where's the toilet paper? This sure isn't gonna cover much ground. I'm running out of everything today! I knew I should've gone to the store yesterday. Ick, so gross. What can go wrong in the shower, right? But after the shower is a different story. I forgot to hang the clean towels back up? Think this shower curtain's absorbent? Only one way to find out. Okay, hopefully this works. Hope no one sees me darting across the -- oof!! Sophia's enjoying a tasty breakfast this Warm tea sure sounds good. This ginger stuff's the best. In you go! The string! How am I supposed to get the teabag out? Ow! HOT! I've gotta get this thing outta here! This is the most annoying thing ever! Let's move on, shall we? An order of toast and jam coming right up! But first we gotta spread on that butter. Which can sometimes prove a little difficult. C'mon, spread! This bread's too soft. Aw man, don't tear! This breakfast's turning into a disaster. I may as well put the jam on. What could go wrong with that? Ooh, first scoop out of the jar! Things are looking better by the second. What, I really like marmalade, okay? And now it's ready! But a bit tricky to pick up. Time for the first -- BITE!! Oh no! After all that?! Ooh! She's on her way home already? She'll kill me if she sees the mess I made. That just means one thing. Time to clean this place up! And first thing's first. We're mopping the floor, people! GAH!! Hey! How does this even happen?! DOH! Say it isn't so!! Nothing is worse than getting wet socks! Well onward and forward. UGH. This feels so gross! I made it. Just barely. And now for the fun part... These floors really needed a good scrub! Phew!! This is a good workout. WOAH!! And I thought I was almost done. May as well get these guys clean! And I'm saddled up and ready to go! This is pretty boring. Can we speed things up a little bit? PHEW! Glad that's over. Wait a second. How did I not see that before? It's like a never-ending cleaning fest in Man, these smell so good, right? I bet they taste even better. Whoops! Ketchup doesn't stain, does it? Thanks. And this shirt's brand new too! Wearing bibs would've been a wise choice. You live you learn, right? A refreshing soda will make me feel better. What? This never happens! Does this mean I can't drink this now? Ooh, Lana, that's a real bummer. Ugh is it morning already? WOAH! I was supposed to be up an hour ago! No time to pick out clothes! I made it by the skin of my teeth! Oh, right. Come on, hurry up, elevator! Why isn't anything happening? GAH!! I just got these done! This is so unacceptable! There's 70 bucks down the drain. And it looks like class already got started! Hopefully no one will notice me. And that's how Hercules came to be! Let's see here... You. Come up and read your homework! Oh man. This is gonna be bad. Where's that flash drive... I can't quite see the opening. Is it upside down? Come on! Just one more second. Does it go this way? It's a standard USB port. Kids these days think they know everything Thank goodness. So, that's how Hercules got his superhuman And that's all I got. Can I sit down now? Could that have gone any worse?! Teacher? May I run to the restroom? Come on, Lana, get it together, girl! We can only go up from here, right? I'm washing my hands clean of this awful Ooh, watch those sleeves! Lana! Pull your sleeves up!! Really?! Turns out things really can get worse! If only wet sleeves became fashionable. Hopefully no one will see my sleeves. They'd better dry quickly. It's the most uncomfortable thing ever! Nothing like the smell of fresh coffee! Mmm! And these veggies are calling my name! Is the pasta ready? Don't want the noodles to get too soggy. First the gloves, then the pot! Here we go! I don't need a colander right? This system works just fine. Or not!! Seriously?! That was all the pasta I have. I guess a salad is all I'm having tonight. So much for my fancy Italian feast. This stuff's pretty good though. Hey Sophia. Is this the last of the tea? There's only, like, two sips in here! Mind if I snag some of yours? Sure. I'll pour it for ya. Thanks! NO! Lemme try again. GAHH! Half of it's on the table now! You've gotta work on those pouring skills. That's it. I give up on today. Uh, thanks. Ever just have one of those days?
