(music) (Sergio) <i>We continue our travels <i>And today, we're visiting the Timna Park.</i> <i>It is one of the largest attractions (Sergio) What a beautiful valley! Have you ever seen <i>It is full of amazing history</i> <i>from the time of King Solomon (music) <i>(Sergio) Today, we will see - (Sergio) This is really cool! (Sergio) So unique! <i>Visit the ancient copper mines.</i> (Sergio) They're mining shafts, <i>Climb Solomon's Pillars.</i> (Rhona) What did it say? (Sergio) <i>And as the best part,</i> <i>we're going to visit a life-size replica <i>a tent that God instructed Moses to build <i>during the exodus from Egypt <i>All this and much more in today's episode (upbeat music) - Are you excited? [music] (Sergio) <i>Timna Park is located just about <i>It is easily accessible (Rhoda) Oh Look! Look at the colors and how massive they are. (Sergio) <i>The Timna Park is very large,</i> <i>so it's recommended <i>Our first stop is to check out <i>called the Mushroom.</i> <i>The mushroom is an unusual formation.</i> <i>It is made of the red sandstone, <i>And so, over centuries, the wind, <i>formed this mushroom-shaped formation.</i> - Wow this is really cool! It's so unique! What a beautiful valley! Have you ever seen No. It's beautiful. (Sergio) <i>We had no idea but now that we're here, (car horn sounds) (Sergio) <i>In the vicinity <i>archaeologists found This site serves as one of the most into the history of copper mining (music) So these are vertical mining shafts. Right now, it's covered with sand, They're chisel marks. They would use chisels, copper chisels This is one of the oldest copper mines When copper gets in contact with air, So it's so easy to spot copper here. Look! You see this rock here, And if you walk, you see green patches, and that's why you know That's what we see-- those vertical shafts So cool! These are the ancient copper mines, (steps on metal stairs) (Rhoda and Sergio) Oh! - (Rhoda) Babe, (Rhoda) These are ladders. - (Sergio) No way! (Sergio) Wow! This looks like there would be steps, (Rhoda) Oh, you cannot crawl up. I'm sorry Babe, you cannot. I definitely can. (Rhoda) You can, but you won't. So this park has been through and its dating. <i>When Nelson Glueck first <i>he claimed that the date of this site and that brought a lot (Sergio) <i>Ironically 30 years <i>additional excavation projects took place,</i> <i>and they dated the site to 300 years They said this place It goes way back, way earlier. <i>But just recently in 2008, <i>found something really cool.</i> <i>They performed high precision radiocarbon <i>and it showed that the site does date (music) So we go from the 30s, to the 60s, &quot;No, it's not,&quot; To... today, &quot;Yes, King Solomon was here.&quot; (music) (Sergio) <i>In these copper mines <i>can be seen in plain sight.</i> So up there on that mountain from 12th to 14th century BC. (Rhoda) They're fighting... animals. Oh, this is a bow and spear. Or bow and arrow. Sorry. (Rhoda) <i>So what I'm touching here <i>but the real ones are here on the walls</i> <i>in its original form It's really unbelievable! (Sergio) These are the hunting ibexes. They depict hunting ibexes and ostriches The hunters are native and they worked here, in Timna, Incredible! (Sergio) <i>It blows my mind to think <i>left a 3000-year-old trace.</i> And it just reminds me that can leave an eternal impact (music) (Sergio) <i>Next, we're driving to the most <i>It's called the Solomon Pillars.</i> Wow! There they are! (Sergio) Wow! (Sergio) <i>So these are natural and they were formed throughout centuries (Rhoda) Wow! They're so massive! Look at them, they're incredible! Wow! (Sergio) <i>These pillars were named <i>who performed the initial excavations I can't hold it much longer! So it's a pretty recent name. He just saved Thank you for your service! (laughing) Climbing lesson number two: Don't go running up the cliff, (music) (Rhoda) <i>So, while Sergio's running <i>I've decided to check out at the bottom of the cliff. <i>According to excavations, <i>an Egyptian goddess of mining.</i> <i>And then, in later period, (Sergio) <i>The archeologists found here</i> <i>a large number of beautifully decorated <i>These were most likely gifts brought <i>However, one of the most significant <i>It is strikingly similar <i>described in the Book of Numbers.</i> <i>The evidence for Midianite culture <i>is of extraordinary importance.</i> <i>You see, in Exodus 18, the Bible says <i>a high priest of Midian.</i> That means that there had been <i>and his site not only proves that, <i>of the Midian culture (Rhonda) There you are. How it was up there? So? It is like you run up and it is so much fun, and you're like, &quot;This is easy!&quot; Then you get to the top, and they get like, What were you thinking running up there? (Rhonda is chuckling) (Sergio) <i>For our last <i>we are heading (music) (Sergio) <i>When I read the book of Exodus, <i>that because of millions of Israelites <i>that the tabernacle it would have been giant, to perform their Levitical duties. (Sergio) <i>This tent is actually built <i>given by God himself to Moses, <i>The size in the Bible is given in ancient <i>and most scholars agree <i>and 150 feet long.</i> <i>And now, that we're here, and I'm seeing <i>I can't believe my eyes-- the tabernacle <i>It's actually more of a size I thought it will be bigger but one of the workers reminded me so that make sense. <i>If you think about it, <i>Of course, they needed to take it down, <i>and then put it back up.</i> It just wouldn't make sense the size of a Herod's second temple, and then keep on taking it down (Rhoda) <i>I've just never given it <i>and I'm so glad that I can see it now.</i> <i>So the next time I read the text <i>I properly able to imagine So the visual always gives that benefit, It's awesome! (Sergio) <i>Walking into this tent, it does help me understand that God instructed But it doesn't explain why. (Sergio) <i>Why is the veil there?</i> <i>Why was it blue, purple, and scarlet?</i> <i>Why did God instruct to have <i>Why were there two cherubim on the ark?</i> <i>God gave so many meticulous details,</i> and they all have a very important purpose <i>In Exodus, chapter 40, God instructed <i>in which this tabernacle should <i>they take it down and move it <i>And the order was pretty simple:</i> <i>after the Ark of the Covenant <i>they were to put the Table <i>then the Screen Door to the tent.</i> <i>And here's what's striking--</i> <i>In the book of John, <i>in the exact same order <i>I AM the Bread of Life.</i> <i>I AM the Light of the world.</i> <i>I AM the Door.</i> <i>It's an incredible match, <i>There are seven &quot;I AM&quot; proclamations</i> <i>and they all follow the exact same pattern <i>And the thing is Jesus did not say <i>Between each &quot;I am,&quot; <i>and when John wrote them down, <i>it's spread out through chapters.</i> And so this order was there, nobody's ever found it before. This is very recent. This was found just a couple of years ago. So this means this pattern And it means that it could have (music) If you're interested to know more about the tabernacle, its significance you should watch this study The link is in the description (Rhoda) <i>I have heard that this place <i>where you can fill out a bottle <i>and take it back home with you.</i> Okay, I think I got it. Here we go. So when you come to Timna Park, so you could do your own sand art It's so cool. (music) - (Rhoda) What do you wanna do with them? - (Rhonda) I don't know I got artistic... - (Rhoda) Now, yellow? (Rhoda) I think you have <i>I don't especially love crafts, but this thing with the sand, That's enough crafts for today. Looks like a Jamaican flag. That's awesome! It's your turn.
