Hello, it's Mamiko from GOROGORO KITCHEN. Today we're heading to the fashion brand 'Sezane' store. It's extremely popular with Parisiennes, and even on weekdays there are often long queues outside. Oh, we can see it! Ah, yes! You can buy 'Sezane' clothes in Japan and other countries, so let's discover some great autumn/winter outfits together. Hello. -Welcome to Sezane. It's beautiful! Wow, it's already in fall clothes. You're right. Fall? Winter? So pretty! It's completely different now. Everything changes so quickly. New things keep coming in. This shop is always so popular. They have nice sweaters. So pretty, I envy you. Oh, of course they already have coats too. It has a nostalgic vibe, which is really nice. -Yes, let me see. -Oh, it's pretty, kind of nostalgic. So pretty, nice choice, Mamiko. It's organised by colour, so you can find things by your favourite colour. This is the brown section. Yes. Oh, this is the same as the one I'm wearing, just a different colour. Look, the buttons here. It's pretty. It's also practical--- warm, soft, and not itchy at all. And the cuffs here are tight, which is a nice little detail. It's simple, but pretty. I really like this, but this colour is nice too. Yes, definitely. Look. I'm wearing grey right now. -Having different colours is nice too. Oh? You know, we use sweaters a lot in the winter. And these kinds of basic colours with a nice little detail, that match with everything--- they're actually pretty rare. -Yes, exactly. In the end, you wear those the most. There is a dress like this too, but this is a bit too tight for me. Tight... Yes. But this looks like something Parisiennes would wear, right? Exactly. But I can't quite become a Parisienne. You are still in training. But the training never ends. This skirt is lovely. Oh, it's beautiful. It's a bit long though. Sezane is really nice. That's why it's so popular. I totally get it. Oh, they have jackets like this too, Tsu-san. -This one's nice too. Oh no, I want so many things now! And here, look, they have all kinds of leather goods. They have wallets too, look. My bag is from here too. Which one? Look, this one and that one. Leather items look pretty good. The set is lovely. Yes, it's nice. This bag is really great, I love it. True. -I thought it was pretty too. The details are really well thought out, you know? It's wonderful. These are lovely too. These small items, when they're well-made, make people think, "This person seems decent." Don't you think? It looks like crocodile leather. Yes, I'm sure it's embossed, but the colour is nice too. As a fan of green, I like it. There are so many bags. Wow, you're right, they're gorgeous. Difficult to choose, right? Yes. This bag is really outstanding, I see so many people carrying it. Yes. I'm pretty picky when it comes to bags and shoes. But it looks like you could use a bag like this, Tsu-san. You're right, is that for me? It could be your work bag. If that's the case, I think I'd prefer the one on top. -Which one? It could even be used as a travel bag. And here we have the shoes. I've been thinking I want a pair of loafers. Ah, I want some too. I heard Sezane shoes are really comfortable. I have sneakers from them, but their loafers are also amazing. A friend of mine already has two pairs. Loafers are pretty, indeed. Tsu-san, isn't this one nice? Oh, it really is. From the front it looks pretty simple, but it has belts on the side that give it such a stylish vibe. It's lovely. Wow, it's so nice. I wonder what size it is. Oh, it's a 37. I can probably just fit into a 37. Yes. I'd like to try it on later. There are also boots, and as a boot lover, these are adorable. Oh, they're light. -They're really light. -No, it's real leather. Yes, these are beautiful too. I love these kinds of work boots. Oh, I like them too. Why are we the same? Tsu-san, stop copying me. No, I'm not copying. I've been looking for work boots recently too. -You're just jumping on it. But look, this one is gorgeous too, and it's only 220 euros. Oh, that's good buy. -It's a good deal, right? It's really amazing. I really like this. That one with the tassels is so stylish. -I should try it on later. And you know, I secretly love leopard print. Oh, leopard print is stylish if you incorporate it just right. Yes, just a little bit on shoes or something. Oops, I missed that. Oh, sorry. Just a little touch of leopard print is really nice. But whenever I see leopard print stuff from Sezane, it's always sold out. Oh, so everyone likes leopard print. -And don't Parisiennes love it too? Yes, it's always sold out. This one here has kind of a reddish tone to it. Like a reddish-brown colour. This colour is nice, right? These colours, or like these ones. Yes. This one is a 36. I can fit into this. I've been eyeing these for a while now. Really beautiful. I don't own many shoes like this, do I? No, but they're lovely. I thought it might be nice to have something more feminine. -Even though you love work boots. But in winter, I end up wearing boots all the time, so pairing these with tights would be really nice, I think. Yes, totally. Oh wow, there are so many nice things, I'm in trouble. Even the display of this table is lovely. And here's another leopard print! Yes, everyone really loves it. This has a pattern on the sleeve, and it's gorgeous. Look! I've never seen this kind of design before, with this part on the sleeves. That's new. It looks warm. And these are... It comes as a set. It's pretty, that kind of things. -Right? It feels like something you'd wear when you can see your breath. But does it ever get that cold? -You mean like breathing in the cold air, right? Well, sort of. That leopard print one... -Lepard? Leopard? That's nice too. But maybe there's a bit too much of it... It might be a bit too much for you? Maybe something a little subtler would be better. For you, I see. But look, this jacket--or rather, coat--is pretty too. Oh, that's nice. Look, it's double-breasted. That combination is lovely too, right? Yes, it's so stylish. So stylish. This is, what do you call it, a knit dress, right? Like this, though it's a bit too big for me. But isn't it pretty? It's really pretty. That's super pretty, I love stuff like that. -Oh, really? Ah, but this is &quot;L&quot;. That's big for you. Yes, I need &quot;S&quot;. Oh, it's nice! But it's quite short though. Well, then maybe M would be better. Oh, that's lovely! I love stuff like that. -Oh, really? Let's try this one on too. Here's another option. Ah, that's lovely. You keep finding more and more. How much is that anyway? I haven't even checked the prices. Let's see, this one is 180 euros. -Oh, that's not expensive. The great thing about here is that everything is a reasonable price. This one is 155 euros. In the end, these are the things you end up wearing the most. And look, here's another pretty one. It looks nice when fashionable people wear things like this. Yes. The question is whether I can pull off that level of style. Right, for Mamiko... -I might end up looking like a real granny. That blue one earlier was good, though. -Oh, really? This knit skirt is lovely too. Now I'm starting to think this one's great too. But isn't it a bit too tight-fitting? Huh? I think it's fine, show it off! But this is &quot;XS&quot;. Oh, I see. It will be too tight for me. Oh, there's &quot;S&quot;. Like this. Isn't this one nice? Yes, it's lovely. For winter clothes. I'm in trouble, the knit skirt is climbing up the ranks. Ah, look! This is the knit dress we saw earlier. Oh, you're right. Pair it with long boots, that might look good. I get it, I can totally picture it now. Yes, it's pretty. I used to wear that style a lot back in the day. -Really? Back then, long skirts like this weren't in fashion. So I always wore knee-length or just above the knee. -Why are you laughing? Even I had my younger days, you know. Well, you're always young. I tripped over my words... I got too nervous and stumbled. It's fine, it doesn't matter at all. And here we are, entering the pink colour zone. Look at this, see? The buttons are sparkly, how nice. Oh, show me. Look. Oh, you're right, the sparkles! Through the camera... oh, I see it now. -Wow. There's a great variety of knitwears here, I love it. I'm always on the lookout for knitwears. This is so pretty. I envy you. Women have so many choices. I'm completely ignoring Tsu-san's opinion. This is &quot;XS&quot;. It's pretty. Mamiko looks like she's having fun. I am having fun. There's also this dress. Isn't it a bit long though? What's the pattern? It's floral. Ah, I see. And it's belted, and it's corduroy. Wow, it's lovely. Yes, it's pretty. Look. My niece is almost at that age... Why are we suddenly talking about your niece? I'm thinking about buying something for my niece. Isn't this nice? Yes, it's nice. The length looks really good too. -Oh, really? It'd be nice if there was a matching belt. -There is, look. Wow, I just said it'd be nice and there it is! You wear it with the belt. Yes, that's pretty. Then I should try it on. Yes, you should try it on. And look, there's knitwear shelf here. Oh, you're right. Hello. There are lots of sweaters. Yes, we have a wide range of sweaters. Isn't it the same one? No, there are lots of different models. We have more iconic models from the brand. I see. And models that are a bit more... Which is the most popular model? Gaspard. I see. This is the brand's flagship model. If you want a piece that really that represents Sezane, this is it. Okay, can I see the pink one? And the red one? Yes, and then maybe ecru. Yes, of course. -Concierge? Pink one is like this. The red one like this. And the white one. Oh, but the white one is pretty too. Oh, I think the white looks good on you. -I think white suits Mamiko. But red is the most popular. Then why not try both? Yes. It's like the red vs white show in Japan? The Team red. OK, thank you. Alright, so we're set with the knitwear, right? This area has all kinds of small goods, it's like a concept shop here. So, they have things other than Sezane too. I see. You can pick out souvenirs while you're buying your clothes. They've got a nice selection, very tasteful. They even sell soaps. You can buy your outfit and a souvenir at the same time, two birds with one stone. And they have socks too. I own some, and this has got a little bit of glittery thread in them, so pretty. Oh, I see. And they're comfortable to wear, they're really nice. I get it. Yes, I own them. I've mentioned it again. Yes, I know. They've also got pouches too. They've got everything, look, even laptop cases. Oh, you're right. That's amazing. Oh, and scarves too. -There are lots of scarves, they're so nice. -Scarves are nice, aren't they? You like scarves, don't you, Tsu-san. But scarves for men are tricky. And they've got jewellery cases too, look. Yes. Isn't this nice? It's lovely. &quot;Will you marry me?&quot; Do I really have to give you so much jewellery? It's quite a task. Well, there's a space for that. -A lot. But this is lovely, it would be nice to have. -I'm suddenly wanting one. It looks great when it's properly stored like this. Yes, I totally agree. How much is this? There's no price tag. No price tag? They probably want you to just buy it without thinking. Is that how it is? And look, this is the area for the knitwear accessories from earlier. You're right. This colour combination is so cute and lovely. -It really is nice. These are nice too. I want to wear a knit cap, but I've reached the age where it leaves marks on my face. I want a cap too, but finding a good one for older men is tricky. -Really? Is a knit cap no good? My face is too big for that. Ah, I see... That's sad... Over here, they have accessories. -Look at this. Sezane's accessories are very easy to use and really nice. Oh, isn't this one lovely? This bracelet. Yes, I can definitely see you liking that. I'm looking for bracelets, earrings, and rings. That's almost everything. Isn't this lovely too? These small earrings are pretty. You're right. Yes, I really like these. There's a same design with stones, look. You're right. -Aren't they pretty in stone too? Especially their colours. I like the one with stones. -Really? Hmm, they have earrings and necklaces in the same design. They're nice when you get them all together. Look, it's only 75 euros. Only 75 euros? That's amazing. This one is 55 euros. Amazing. They're super convenient for daily wear. I have a metal allergy, but this doesn't hurt even when I wear it. I see. There are other colours too. They have different colours... and there are pendants. So you can attach them to your necklace. That's true. You can attach them to necklaces like these too. I see. Doesn't this look similar to mine? Is this the same? Ah, Yes? Oh, I see, Yes. I really love this one; I use it all the time. Oh, really? Yes. And they also have ear cuffs. There it is, I love ear cuffs. I know. When it comes to Tsu-san, it's all about ear cuffs. The stylish kid. A kid...? That's right. -There are so many different styles. For me, the image of a Parisienne is a woman who wears lots of accessories like these. -Yes, I get it. -That's what Mamiko aspires to be. But I haven't quite reached that level yet. But I always think it's wonderful. And they have some home goods too. Oh, really? -Look at this. This is a candle called &quot;feu de vie.&quot; It smells great. This is nice too, Tsu.-san. -You're right. Oh, she's ended up looking for the same things as usual... -But look, we can use it as small bowls. And it's light. I can't believe we came to a clothing store and found dishes. -But it's pretty. Yes! &quot;Where did you buy it?&quot; &quot;Oh, it's from Sezane.&quot; There's a larger one too. The smaller one is prettier than the big one. Yes, and they have various colours, See? You're right. There's a woman over there looking confused. I wonder if that's for sale. Oh, maybe it's not? Probably not. It says &quot;Gustav Klimt&quot; on it. Also, I think this pitcher could work as a vase. Oh, you're right. Isn't it pretty? It's pretty large size. -But the opening is big. -Oh, really? It looks really easy to put things in. That's true. Also, they have it in pink. Huh? Oh, you're right. -It's pretty, isn't it? I can't help looking for vases. This one is 45 euros. They have this colour too, Tsu-san. There's also this khaki colour. Oh, yes. Maybe khaki is nice. We have white and pink, but not khaki. That's true. -So, that's nice, isn't it? And apparently, the belts are popular too; look at all the colours. Fashionable! As for belts, I only have two. Oh, then what about something like this, Tsu-san? Definitely leopard print; I'd prefer that. Oh, Tsu-san, are you going for something like this? Or maybe something more gorgeous? It's stylish and pretty. It looks nice. I think it would look good on a woman. But if a man wears it, it might look odd. I wonder why they can gather such a Parisienne vibe; it's amazing how much Parisienne style is here. I think that's just how it is when Parisienne creates things, right? No, I don't think that's the case; it's surprising how many things look so Parisienne. -Well, that's probably why it's popular. The pretty colour combinations, like this blue paired with that, are lovely. It gives off a really nice vibe; I have lived in Paris for over 10 years, and I really feel that way. Now, here are some more home goods. Look at this. They have fabric like this too. Oh, really? -They have cushions too. Oh, and they have lights, Tsu-san. That's right. This light is nice. Yes, it's true; we're looking for one, and I didn't expect to find it here. This round one is nice too. Yes. Are you going to buy the light? Also, Tsu-san, they have these cushions too. Oh, really? Wow, that's nice. I always think that these long, thin shapes are wonderful. Look, this one has a different pattern on the front and back; that's nice. She's going to spend a lot again... And I love this soft pink; it's nice. Yes, it is nice. And this yellow light is lovely too. Yes, it's nice. Oh, and this cushion is great too. Oh, Mamiko... -Oh, how pretty! Why do you buy everything so easily? I'm not buying anything. -Not yet. I'm just saying I like it. I'm just pointing out that there are so many beautiful things in the world. Excuse me, I have a question. Do you have any other colours? Yes, this sweater, we're going to have it in green, yellow and pink. But unfortunately we don't have them here in the shop. I see. It's going to be exclusively on the website, and you can still order online. OK, fine. But it might be a good idea to try it on first. Yes. Just a fitting would be nice. I'd like to try this colour anyway. To see the size, and how does it fit? Yes. OK, very good. So it's &quot;S&quot;. I think it's going to be OK. Yes, it's quite small. Yes, OK, so I'd like to try &quot;S&quot;. Yes, of course. Thank you. So I tried on various things. Of all of them, the one I liked the most was... Well, how do you think? Wow. So pretty! It's super pretty! It looks much better than I expected. So nice! I thought it might be a bit too tight for me, but it looks so sleek and neat. It's really lovely, very chic. These buttons are lovely too. Show me the buttons. Isn't it lovely! It's pretty and adult-like. Lovely. And it's easy to wear, as it's knit wear. Wow, this is nice! It's great! -Maybe some accessories would also be nice with it. Should I ask? Yes, let's ask. Let's check. Alright! Could you tell me on the accessory that will go well with this? Yes, of course. If you want to do tone on tone, we have this lovely necklace. Ah, that's lovely. Which can be very nice. Yes, it's pretty. Yes, that will add nice touch to the sweater. Oh, it does feel Parisienne. Exactly. Otherwise, if you want a bit of colour to contrast, you can wear pretty red earrings like this. I see. Which go very well with green. Oh, it really does. It's amazing that she chooses things that I would never choose. That's true. But isn't it pretty? Oh, it's super nice! I think the necklace could be a bit simpler, maybe thinner. But I think it would be nice... can you move a little more towards the centre? I can't see the total look. Something like this. Oh yes, it's lovely. It's nice to have things like this; it adds a colourful accent. I see; I've learned about the Parisienne style. Yes, we've learned it. Do you have a simpler, thinner necklace? Yes, of course. This one will be very simple. True. It's a small chain. After that, you can add small medallions if you like, this one for example. I see. It can be very pretty and it's discreet. Yes. It's true, it's certainly look discreet and nice. How can we do it? Normally, I think it's hanging on. I don't know if it can go through... I don't think so... Maybe not this one, then. I think the big one will do but... Yes. Well, it might be too big. Then something like this. I think earrings would have suited it better for you. What do you think, Mamiko? He prefers... Yes. Very nice. Yes. That's true. A bracelet could work too? A bracelet? Isn't that bracelet? Oh, like a bangle? Maybe some bracelets? Bracelets? Yes. Gold one. I don't know, gold one? Yes, I think so. This one is very nice. Ah, this one. It's very trendy at the moment, bangles like that. That's right; it looks cool. -Yes, it definitely looks cool. Like a young boy? Let me see a bit more of the total coordination. But since the sleeves are long, a bracelet might not show much. No, there is already a button on the arm... I think I prefer the earrings. The red one. Yes, that's definitely pretty, I think. -This one. -This one is lovely. This could be good. -So, should I get this with this knitwear? Since the top and bottom are separate, it's really versatile. It's perfect. That's true. I usually like a dress, but I think I can make more use of these. Yes, and they are super nice. Oh, I'm glad. Some things are in the shop, and some things are not, so... Let's think it over. -Think carefully and then pay. -Thank you very much. -Thank you very much, good-bye. -Good for you! Shall we head home then? Yes. We are back home. The knitted top and bottom set I tried on earlier. I think I'll try wearing it like this first? I decided to try looking for the knitted item I wanted to buy but couldn't find in the right size or colour at the online shop. The Japanese website has now opened, so the same items can be purchased in Japan too. Oh, there are lots of pretty items I didn't see before... I've also been wanting to buy this cardigan. I've clicked the button! A few days later. It arrived in a lovely box. There were cards with a nice scent in it. I get really excited when I open a package. There were so many things I wanted to try on, so I ordered five items. First, a short-length, high-necked brown-beige sweater. I'm glad that this sweater has a good length, even for someone as short as me! I've decided to buy it. The second one is a yellow sweater. It's also lovely, but it might be similar to the one I'm wearing today... I think I'll return this one. I'm glad that I can return the items I got from Sezane, and that the initial return postage is free. The third sweater is the most popular model in blue-green. It can also be worn with the back in front. The fourth item is a grey cardigan with beautiful glittering buttons. It's a little long for me, so I'm afraid I'll have to return this one too. The last one is a cardigan of the same colour as the set I bought at that shop. I think this will give me more options for mix and match, so I've decided to buy this too! I think I'll be able to stay nice &amp; warm this autumn and winter
