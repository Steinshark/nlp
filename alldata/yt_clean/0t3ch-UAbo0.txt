Ok lets move on. our first, today is our first lesson is basic conversation what is basic conversation? basic conversation this in this class contains hello? goodbye thank you and I'm sorry this four expression I get, I think are really important why it's important without this expression you can't speak any you can't speak any word in world like and you meet someone you have to say &quot;Hello?&quot; and, when you or separate with your friend you have to say good bye and what of our next you, when you feel really appreciated, you want to say thank you .. and? when you make someone feel uncomfortable or when you make a little mistake to someone? you have to say &quot;I'm sorry&quot; it's a literally basic conversation. So? today, where gonna learn about this four expressions ah! before we move on. I wanna Tell you that Korean has two types of speaking one is honorific way to speak another is a casual way to speak honorific way is use to older people and use to in formal situation like a formal meeting in your company ok? and. casual way is used to one who is the same age or close especially among friends so? remember? Korean has two types of speaking one is honorific another is casual and it is really relevant to Korean culture so, please remember that and now, we're really gonna move on I'm sorry and first one is &quot;HELLO?&quot; HELLO, and? how can you pronounce this? I know you don't know that, let me do it. An-nyong ha-se -yo An-nyong ha-se-yo ok, and then faster. Annyong haseyo? Annyong haseyo? ok? so, HELLO is &quot; Annyong haseyo? &quot; Annyong haseyo? the Pronunciation is written in English so there's no... I think there's gonna be no problem for you to pronounce this expression on your own ok? and, follow me, one more time &quot;Annyong haseyo?&quot; &quot;Annyong haseyo?&quot; and, as I said. Korean has two types of speaking and this expression is a formal greeting formal greeting OK, for instance you meet your friends, Korean friends parents oh! they are older than you are and you wanna say hello in Korean and they... your friends parents in this case &quot;HELLO&quot;. you have to say is &quot;annyong haseyo?&quot; &quot;annyong haseyo?&quot; good! and, next one. &quot;annyong?&quot; &quot;ann-yong?&quot; &quot;ann-yong?&quot; it's shorter and easier. Right?! &quot;Annyong?&quot;/ &quot;Annyong?&quot; it's a casual way to greet people so whenever you see your friends? just say, &quot; Oh! Annyong?&quot; so, your-- first to say your friends name is Jenny. &quot;Oh! Hello Jenny?&quot; in Korean? &quot;Oh! Annyong Jenny?&quot; Annyong Jenny? make sense? so First one, A Formal greeting. Hello in Korean &quot;Annyong haseyo? / &quot;Annyong haseyo?&quot; and next one, &quot;Annyong?&quot; / &quot;Annyong?&quot; Does that make sense? OK, and... Next. oh! I'm sorry Good bye. / Good bye let me tell you. it's a little confusing to remember because? kore-- Good bye has two types of expressions and, it is depending on who is leaving who is leaving for your better understanding? let me give you an example. you are the host and you invite a lot of people And? after enjoying all the party. they're just leaving. and, you wanna say good bye to them. OK? remember you are the host. and you wanna say Good Bye to your guest. in this case good bye in Korean? &quot;Annyonghi-gi--gaseyo.&quot; &quot;Annyonghi-gaseyo.&quot; OK? it's a little fast ok? Let me take it slow. An-nyong-hi-ga-se-yo. one more time. An-nyon-hi-ga-se-yo. Annyonghi-gaseyo so, as i said. this one is a formal &quot;good bye&quot; it's more polite. what about your friend? what i'm gonna say? to your friends? &quot;Jal-ga&quot; &quot;jal-ga&quot; one more time. &quot;jal-ga&quot; / &quot;jal-ga&quot; so? &quot; good bye &quot; is Annyonghi-gaseyo and, &quot;jal-ga&quot; in case you are the host and you say good bye to your guest. so in this case, Good bye is &quot;annyonghi-gaseyo&quot; and &quot;jal-ga&quot; are you following me? good and next one. and, it's an opposite situation now, you're just invited to the party and you enjoy the dinner and party with your friends and it's time to leave so, you'll leaving now your leaving and you wanna say good bye to the host of the party OK? in this case good bye is? &quot; annyonghi-geseyo&quot; one more time. &quot; An-nyong-hi--&quot; it is the same here but? the ending part is different., &quot;-ge-se-yo&quot; &quot;ge-se-yo&quot; one more time. &quot; annyonghi-geseyo &quot; / &quot;annyonghi-geseyo&quot; OK? what about to your friends? when your friend is the host. say. &quot; Jar-it-sso&quot; good bye./ &quot;Jar-it-sso&quot; one more time. &quot; Jal-it-sso &quot; so now you get it? still no? OK? it's last time to review good bye. keep this in your mind alright! when your the host of the party or of the dinner and whatever it is... you wan't to say good bye to the guest visitors. ok? and this case, good bye is? &quot;annyonghi-gaseyo&quot; annyonghi-gaseyo imagine that your just staying in your home and you're just to send them off. so, Annyonghi-gaseyo. and jal-ga/ jal-ga &quot;Jal-ga&quot; is a casual way (which you can)use to your friends and this is a formal way. &quot;Annyonghi-gaseyo and Jal-ga and the next one you just-- you were just invited to party and you are leaving and you wanna say good bye to the host who is staying ok? in this case good bye is &quot;annyonghi-geseyo&quot; &quot;annyonghi-geseyo&quot; and next one. &quot;Jar-it-sso&quot; / &quot;jar-it-sso&quot; so, now make sense? ok.. then... next.
