So, the first round is to make a starter. However, they will not have any instructions on how to make it. There will also be various some of which may be needed. Some are just to throw them - Alright, it is time - Whoa - We have the blue team first. - Yeah! - That is going to be Harry, of course. - Yes. - Who do you wanna be Who'd you like to be with? - I honestly don't have faith in any of them there at all. - Who do you have the least faith in? - The least faith in, Deji, I'm sorry. I don't - What, why? - He's not done The Sidemen before. - You've got Vik. - Oh, that's not too bad. - Oh, wow. - Cool, cool, cool. - Next up we have the - Oh. - Starters on the red team is Devi. - Yeah, yeah. - Oh. [laughter] - But who is Deji with? One of the strongest cooks, I think, here. - It's me. - He is with his brother, JJ. - Oh! [laughter] - The other team in the Now, as we have said, there - Yeah. - The first challenge in front of you, is a We are gonna be telling You have 20 minutes to make it. - 20 minutes, is that it? Some of the ingredients may not be needed. - Oh, great. - Some of them may be needed. Josh? - And also, if you look down, as well, you'll see there's no recipe. There's no instructions. - Oh. - We tow it to make it. - Yep. Yeah. Yeah. - So, you are making pancetta You have 20 minutes to go. - Huh? - Okay. - Just go. - All right, let's go. Let's get to it. Get your outfits on as well, please. - Can we use the internet? - No. No phones. - 20 minutes has started. Pancetta and cheese potato balls. - So, obviously there's cheese. - I don't know what a pancetta is. - Do we wanna win this or do we want to... - Poison them? - Yeah, because if we wanna win this, we can smoke these guys. - Yeah, no, let's get busy. - All right. Are we ovening or are we going to deep fat fry them? - Have you've got any goose fat? - Well, we've got grape seed oil, though. So, we can deep fat fry this. - There's some aprons behind you as well. - Oh, man. - There's some aprons behind you, JJ. - Get that coat off, put that on. - That's Pancetta? So, we need to cut that up - Hello! - Hello, my friend. How are you? - Got any idea how to make them? - Yes. - I'm about to. I'm about cook, yeah? - Yeah. - Alright, you ready? We're gonna fry off bits of pancetta. - Yeah. We're also gonna peel these potatoes. Cut them down a bit. Then we're going to, bread them and fry them and make like a essentially potato-ey, mash-y, with pancetta and cheese in it, and breadcrumb it and fry it. - Let's see what you do. - Which one's pancetta, though? - This. I'm not an idiot. - Yeah. [laughing] - That's ham. - I am tasting it, by the way. - So, there's cheese. - Is that pancetta? - Are you sure that's pancetta? - It has to be. I mean, what else is it? It can't be meat. Can it? - I think it's this. It's something to do with this. - But that's meat. - What do you reckon pancetta is? - Ham? - Oh, that's clever. - What do you think the - That. - Let's go. - You are leading here, - Right. Potatoes, we need. Yes. - Do you want them peeled? - All right. Potato peeler? - I'm thinking we just pull it into balls. - Put what into balls, though? - Chuck it in the oven. Wait, turn the oven on. - How do you turn the oven on? So this is why you have a chef. I see. - Dice them... - Oh, actually no, I don't even know. - What do you think the potato a ball is? - What I'm assuming is I don't even know what you to maybe boil these first to soften them. - Well, let's peel them anyway. - Peel them. Peel them. Peel them. - What kind of progress - Making some progress already? - Harry, do you know how - Yes, but we don't have a lot of time. - All right, we gotta start cheating bro. Okay, they have pans. - Look, we got pans here. What are they doing with a potato, bro? Wait, cause it's and Wait, is it potato balls? - Pancetta and cheese potato balls. - So, maybe we do need potatoes. - Oh wow. That's just rock hard. - That's what she said. - This is the best potato peeler - Crank that baby up to full. Now, I would never do but because we're here, - What? Is it time to get - It's worth a shot, you know? Alright, cool. That's going. - Who do you think is the - Ethan and Harry right now are. - The leaders. - I wouldn't call us leaders, really. [laughter] Please don't call us leaders. - Where should I put the skins? I put the skins in here, or something? - No. You're meant to scrape it, bro. - Scrape the potato? - Yeah, you scrap. - All right, I'll scrape it then. - Where's the scraper thing? - What the..? Try and scrap. Try. Try and scrape it. - It's working. You can't - You know what? Just do that, man. - He's grating a potato. - 20 minutes is actually - No. - Can you start boiling some - We don't have any water. - There is water over there. - Do we need to get water? - For what? What do you need water for? - Don't know. They get it. [laughing] - So, you should get it, too? - Have we got to boil the potatoes? Yes, I would assume so. Yeah, cause we got mashed But this is, this is, this is crazy, you know. - Oh, it should be mashed, shouldn't it? - Yeah. - Whoa, you, look at this thing, man. What are you doing? - What's all this here? - What are you doing man? It's not that. I dunno what it is, but it's not that. - Are you sure it's nothing over here. - That's it. This is what we need, bro. - Ladies and gentlemen, this year isn't just any year. So, this Black Friday couldn't This year is the year of the Ultimate Cyber Black Friday. - Yes!

We can work it out. - I'm gonna go get water, as well. - That's a good strategy you've got going there. Look at this. Look at this technique. - Dej? - I don't want to help any team, right? Try doing it the other way. - Yeah. Like, try to pull it instead. - Oh. - Oh, my... - I would have had to be the leader. - Nah, he's cooking. He's cooking We're doing it wrong. - I don't know. - No, well... - No. Okay. - 15 minutes remaining. - You grated sh*t into our thing. - What's this? - Aw, sh*t. - I don't know what this is. - Why are you holding it then? - Because they chopped it up. I don't know. - What'd you do with pancetta? - I dunno what's going - There's the whole section there. - Send tech support in, - Well, no. We need to f*cking get - Yeah, I know but we - No. Help! - Where are our sharp knives? - We have no arm. - Move. - Look, I've done this. Now what, Dej? Now what? - I don't know. - We just have a potato. Look it's the potato ball. Why don't you add a bit Get a plate somewhere and place it, bro. No, get a... Plate. Not a bowl, Dej. A f*cking plate. f*ck me, man. - Now we need to whip eggs because we need to fry the the ball, don't we? - Oh, we're cooking on this team. Actually cooking something, we are? - When making mash, before, at home, I was told that all your pieces of potato need to be a similar size. - So they boil to the same degree. - It's simple stumbling block that other teams could fail on. - Well, our massive stumbling block is we don't have a working top. - What's that? What's going on there? - I don't know, I'm making balls. - Are you? - Why're you cutting the balls? - That's slices. - No, I'm gonna sculpt it. - You're gonna sculpt it. - So, you know, with heat Luckily your potatoes, balls, realistically, aren't they? - Yeah, but I feel like that's too much. - Okay. - This is hard to do in - We gotta step it up then. Lord, help me. When's the - Come on, stop boiling, please. Oh, that was a good one. - Oh, I like that. Get mixy with the egg. - Yeah. We cooking. - I think we've got good traction here. - Yeah. Now, we're cooking. - We cooking? Yes! - There you go. - Child lock on it. - Don't look at their team. - Okay. They're doing something with eggs. - The first thing we need to and then we'll, we'll make cheesy mash. Then we'll just put the fried And then you're gonna deep fat fry it. - Yeah. - f*ck it. It could work, - This does seem promising. - That needs to hurry up Otherwise we ain't doing it in 15 minutes. - 12 minutes, if it helps. - Thanks. Really good. Really good, Simon. Really good. - At least it's edible. I need lunch. - Yeah, you do need lunch, don't you? Boy. - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, I had breakfast. Now, lunch. - Yeah but you just had breakfast. - Yeah but by the time you are finished... - Why would you put the potato - Well, how is that dumb? [chuckling] - What are you doing? - It'll blend together though. - You're such a f*cking moron. - We don't have long. - We don't have long. - Once this is mashed, we are going to mash it down. - Put some cheese in it. Put Then dip it in the egg. Dip it in the flour. Fry it. Cheese bowl, yeah? - What are you doing? - What? What are you doing? - I don't know. I'm just kind of looking at what they're doing. - Wait, no. Put the egg in the bowl. - No, Dej, I think, wait, Why have you put the potatoes, Get the potatoes out. Get the potatoes out. Get - Oh. Sorry. - You f*cking idiot. Get the potatoes out. - I don't think we could do it in time. - I know. - I don't think we're gonna do it in time. - So, we have blue team. Harry seems like he knows what he's doing, but Vik was spending about five minutes looking for knives. - And washing his hands. I'm not confident in them at all. - I don't know, Harry can pull He never lost ever. - True. - He seemed like he The red team. - We don't talk about red team. They've got an absolute They got some good - Yeah, the might have like a, you know, like a family owned restaurant? You know how the food I feel like that's the - He grated a potato. - Hey Siri, how long does - And then the final team... - Sorry, I've just seen phone to Google about boiling potatoes. So, I feel like we may have to intervene. - You saw it? - I literally watched him do it. - Potatoes are boiled between 10 and 25 minutes, depending - Oh, I should cut them - Maybe. - We may have to intervene - Remove what, though? - Uh, Eggs. Sorry team but I have - No, Siri-ed. No, I Siri-ed. - Oh, you see? - I asked how long a potato needs to boil. - This will be removed. - Cheaters! - I asked how long a - Cheaters! Dirty cheaters! - I did say no phones. - You didn't. - No! What the f*ck do we do now? We got no eggs. - Hello, Deji and JJ. - You can have this. - Oh, sick. - It was prepared be this team for you. - Thank you. - What a mess. Look at you. Look at what you are doing. - Sorry.

Just let me cook. - Oh, what are you doing with the egg? - Put the egg yolk in it. - In the potato mixture. - Really? - It'll just make it taste nice. - So, that's gonna go in the mash. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's all right. We can still, we can still get - We'll make it work. - That was rookie error from - Any cheating going on here? - Anti-cheated? - We've been cheated. - And also we've come - Yep. - There is only enough, you can only... [background music stops] Now don't put the water That is the one thing you don't do, Vik. Anything but the boiling oil The issues is there's only a certain amount heat to go around. So, because we're using these - Yeah, can't share the heat that well. - Other teams are managing - Yeah, but they're not we're cooking here. We we're trying to... - Well, cooking is about doing - Yeah. Well, we think we're not gonna... - We're angry customers who want our food. - Yeah. We're not gonna be There's no hope. - We're in big trouble - It's not gonna. - I dunno what to do. - sh*t, sh*t, sh*t. But hey, at least we But, at this point, they might even have something to dish up. - Eight minutes. How are you getting on? You made an omelette for us. - No, no, no. I'm cooking. Just you wait. The omelette will turn into balls. - So, what are you doing now? - Doing the potato part. Is that already in there? - So, is there no potato in there? - No, no, no.

Dej, come on! - Harry, I know you want to do it, but it's not, we don't, we can't. - You have have to. - Because that's how you - Yeah, but it's not even hot. - You might actually But it looks the worst. - What if we don't have - We're not gonna have Don't worry. - Yeah. This wasn't a valid time. - It was made in that time. - But by people that could do it. - Yeah. - If I discovered some - It looks like you discovered them. - Bro, literally... - So, I get punished for utilising them? - He sat behind here. - I literally laid them right. - If their your eggs, - That is his egg. You - If you laid them, that's fine. - He laid the egg, bro. - Your eggs have been used nicely, anyway. He's made an omelette for you. He did make, he just dashed it in. - Why isn't this working? Or induction-ing. - We need more water. - No, it's fine. - Yeah, but it's fine. then that can go to max. - Let's optimise what - Okay. Okay. - And this mash is not yet mashing. Are they soft? - Once that's boiled enough. - Yeah. - Really good, Dej, keep it up. - Run Dej, proud of you, man. That water you're cooking looks nice. - Bro's cooking water. - Put this on that. - Wrap it around. And that will be the ball. And the potatoes inside. - Oh, so it's the opposite. - Why you have that much water? Why do you have that much What are you doing? What are you doing? - Adding water. - So, when it starts - He's just covered - The whole and the whole thing's covered. - It's just f*cking water everywhere. You are such an idiot.

You want a microwave it, then? - I think that's the - So, there's about one - Just under, yes. - No one is close. We have, so far we have nothing, an omelette and nothing. Do we extend? - If you end it now, you - True. Is that a win? - I do want to eat something - That's what I'm saying, you can't judge it if there's nothing. - We get them a little five minutes. - Cause as much as there is It's not even a potato there. - And some cheese. - I think we give them an extra five. - They'll appreciate five minutes. - Just microwave that, man. Start, start. Just start, start. - Yeah, nice. You have to put timer on. I wish... - You have 30 seconds left. However, we are gonna extend the time. - Yeah! - You have five more minutes. - f*ck. - Five more minutes or nothing at all. - Okay, this is perfect. Is - I don't know. - Bro, it's just falling It's not even a ball at this point. - Wait let's, we need to, - Right? Let's go then. - Well, think about what you're doing. - Okay. - I'm just gonna cut - No, no, no, no. You've got a grater. - What we can do, yeah though, is we can garnish, in this time. That's, we're not serving that. That's coming straight - I was desperate. - So you're micro potato, you've got an omelette - Yeah. So, what's happening with that now? - So, we need the potato for the balls. - Yeah, cause potato balls. - Okay. So, what's that gonna do? - That's going to be the coating. - Of the potato? - How are you gonna make it stick? - I'm putting some garnish - That's nice. - Tomato by the side? - No. - It's got no place there. - What's got place there, then? - No. No. It doesn't That's, yeah. Look, I like that. - So, you guys are for this potato? - Yes. - Anything else you wanna try and do while it's happening? - There's nothing else we can do. - So, how are you gonna make this stick? - We'll just stick it, - Smush it in. - I also noticed you put which you have five minutes left. So, when this ends... - Yeah. You have three minutes, 18. - So, what happens then? - You burning yourself?. But it's for the greater good, my friend. It's for the greater good. Ah, ya-yah. - I can tell they're hot. This potato is raw by the way. - What? I dunno what this is, bro. - We made crisps. - I dunno what we've done. - I dunno know what we've done. - What are you going to do with that? - Oh, honestly, I have no idea. - What's that doing to that? - I've never microwaved potato in my life. - I don't know why you did. - You have one minute, - Okay. - Grasp for it, man. - There we go. Yeah. This is gonna crisp up, as well. This is gonna be, this is food. We're Look at, honestly, we are cooking up. - That's enough. That's enough. - Simon, Something's happening over here. - With one minute, 30 left. - Oh, we, we're... let - Let us cook. - They, they've already, they finished before the first time. So, even with five minutes. - I'm just gonna make these balls now. - Can you even eat this? Try it. Try it. Try and eat it. - Wait. - No, don't. - Nice. Now try and eat it. Is it edible? - Sorry. How did, how did that timer just restart? - What do you mean? - I think, yeah, you pressed that. - Are they just getting free reign to like, make up a gourmet dish? I'm talking about the other team. - I know, I know. Boys. - I'm moving this down. - It's not bad. - It's hot as f*ck. - One minute remaining. - Let's get serving up - No, no. - You can't serve them - It's not gonna be hot There we go. - Oh, we're cooking. - Oh, just put them... That'll do. - 30 seconds. - No, this is good. They're This is actually working. It's working. - Okay, cool, cool, cool. Do it for like, a minute or so. - Yeah. Yeah. I'm just - Where's the plates? We - You know what? - We've forgot to wash our hands. - They don't mind, Man. - I heard that. I was right here. Don't try for my breast to try and fix it. - Look, anyway, it's been heated to f*ck. - Yeah, yeah. True. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good idea. - We have to turn this off. sh*t, this is on. f*ck. - The timer has gone, Josh. - Okay, okay. Let's serve them. - Stop them. - We're serving up. - Overtime, go quick. - Overtime, overtime. - Overtime, get served. Get ready. - Stop them. - Stop them. - Go on, get served up. - He said 30 seconds time for us. - You're being too generous. All right. You ready, you done? - No, don't worry, don't worry. It'll be taken into account. - Okay. There we go. - Okay. Please bring your - Alright. Challenge complete. Your - Yes, my friend. - Simon's gonna bring out what - This is the actual dish. - Okay. - So, immediately one of them stands out as not being a ball. - Yeah, that middle - Is that raw potato? - It's all about - It's abstract. - So, this is your one, middle one, yeah? - Yes. This is ours. - So, do you want to describe - So, we knew what it was - Yeah. - But we decided to add because, you know, we're artistic people. You know, I do a bit of music. You do a bit a music. [laughing] - So what's your twist on it? - So, the twist is why instead of it being a ball, why don't it just be not a ball? - It's expressing itself. - Let the ball be happy - Be what it wants to be. Exactly. - Sometimes in life, you fall apart. - It's 2023. - You are allowed to be - That is a ball. - We allowed this ball to - That was a load of waffle. Presentation wise, we're I'm gonna give everyone a score out of 10. - A presentation. - Based on this, the closest to it. I think it's the green team. - Come on! - At the same time. This it does have vegetables on the side. - We've got garnish too, by the way. - So presentation wise, I'm - I'd agree with a seven. - He did say it was deconstructed. You don't gotta be a ball. - 2023, man. - But at the same time, - True. - You can get a four instead - Or an 11. - Four is generous. - They are living with that. - Four? Unless you disagree. - This team. - If they've got a seven, I The rest of the presentation, - Eight. - Yeah. Eight or seven. - So, we'll go seven. However, [gasping] - So, we are gonna remove - Fine. Fair enough. - So, you have got a six for that. - We'll take it. - We got two more than the plate of sick, is what we are saying? - Yeah, but they were in time. - Okay. Fine. - Time is key in the kitchen. - You said we had time. - Time is key in the kitchen. - Now inside the balls. [laughing] - You have the cheese, panceta. - Wow. I think it's gonna be a - So, which one do you wanna eat first? - I wanna do what you did. - I wanna get this one. - Maybe don't open it - And you open it up and you So, we're gonna see - Okay, you know what? It isn't that bad. It's pretty good. - Hot. Ooh. - Can I grab the, should I try this one as well? - Are you sure you don't - It is open. - Green team, let's see the consistency. Oh, it's soft. - It breaks apart quite nicely. - That's quite a raw potato there. - Raw potato in there, I feel. Yeah. - That's quite solid. - If we had an extra 10 minutes, maybe. - Maybe we could have f*cking... - This one smells the - That leaves one more plate, Right? [laughing] - What's inside that? [cheering] - It breaks apart nicely. - Tear-ability in that is good. - It's not raw. - Okay, I think we have to taste them. - Let's go from bottom to top. So, omelette first? - I mean, guys. - You gotta get a bit - Yeah, and meat. [incoherent talking] - No, get some meat. Get some meat. - No, don't worry. I will. - Is that potato? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Again, 2023, you know, This one wants to be... - Yeah, there you go. Yeah, that. That was a good piece. - Okay, I can't really - I got the three ingredients here. Bro made actual chips. - I don't think you're gonna - We'll find out. - Ooh. - Oh, my god. You see that rabbit? - Stick his teeth out. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. - Well, I really like it. [laughing and screaming] - Oh no. - It's pancetta and egg, of - It's actually really good. - No. - The potato is quite crispy, but the rest is actually really nice. - Oh, my God. - Well done. [clapping and laughing] - It's seasoned well. - Thanks, guys. - Give us some credit. - The egg is the stand - Who did the egg on your team? - We did. We did it together. - What went into the egg? - We got the egg. That was about it. [laughing] Maybe it's the way we were like, sivving it? - You sivvered it well. - Let's go for Harry and Vik's. - Oh. Oh. - I wouldn't do the that. - We'll find out the hard way. - Stop talking. - What do you mean &quot;You - It could be tasty. - I'm gonna bite into it this way. - Didn't hear much crunch there. - They're thinking, they're thinking. Thinking is good. - It's not bad. - They're not making disgusted faces. - Tastes like a hash brown. - Yeah, it's like a - That's what we were going for. - A bit bland on the flavour. - Yeah. I can tell you're white. [laughing] - It isn't bad. - I do like the egg more. - We'd have made a f*cking omelette. We would've done that. If that was what we needed to do. Would've made the potato omelette. We would've sacked the potato. - I fully agree, by the way. That f*cking bangs. This sh*t is so good.

Should we just make it She's making it into a swirlly turd. - Let's do it. - It'd be funny. Make a swirlly turd. - No, that looks good though. Looks good. - So much funnier if it - Gimme a plate, then. That does not look like a plate, Dej. - You don't have a plate. - What if this loses it for us, Harry? - It won't, it won't. - Will they? I don't think they will. - They put their meat in the microwave. - Why? And the omelette went into the puree. That's what's happened. So, they kind of freestyled. - Freestyled? Fine. - Little pizazz. - What do you want us to - Well, are you done?| - The steak's fine. - Yeah, we finished two days ago, bro. They're shooting our cinematics. - Stop being a goodie two shoes, okay? - They're shooting our cinematics. - Might lose points for it. - I might have to take point of you. - Have you tried this? - I'm eating in a second, aren't I? - Yeah, but still. - Yeah. - Isn't it lovely? It's one of my favourite things ever. - Oh, Simon. I tried some. - Why are you trying? - It was forced upon - You will try it. - I'd have to. - Why is it that colour? - I don't know. - Oh, my God. What is that? - It's a dog sh*t. - What happened, why's there poo on it? Why have you got poo on there? - We thought we'd embrace - Yours looks really, you guys are f*cking smashing today. - You're douches, man. You are a try-harding so, so much, man. - Okay boys, you have all finished. - Yes. - Obviously, you are following Kimberly, could you show us the correct. - What it should've looked like. - All right, are we ready for this? - Oh wow. Oh no. - Oh, that is looking... - Oh, my God. - Looks delicious. - You're right. We should Why did we take the heads off? - Why did you take the - He said to take the heads off. [laughing] - It just looks like celery. - Why in the hell is that on that plate? - We'll find out in a second. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - What is that? - Just wait. Just wait. Just wait. - What is that? - Real good sh*t. - Literally. - That doesn't make it more appetising. - It's a pun, Tobi. [laughing] - Real good sh*t. Okay, so the first thing we have to judge on is presentation. - What, where, what, who did this? [laughing] - So, can we explain? - Basically, that is our Didn't come out the right colour, so we thought we'd embrace the colour. - Sure. - He put in the steak juice. - Trying to add flavour. - Made it poo. - Right, it makes it a - We did worry about that. [laughing] - That was a conversation. - We kind of went rogue here. This is a completely different dish, but - We call it The Three Islands. - The Three Islands, okay. - Yeah, why? - Does JJ knows about this name? - He looks confused by it. - I guess we are calling it that. - They feel like they're floating - I witnessed these two, basically, about to make an omelette - That is not egg. That is not egg. - Is that egg? - Please be honest. - Wait, doesn't that make - No, it's edible. [laughing] - They, actually was doing in a sense of what it looked like. - They were? - Then they kind of abandoned ship. I don't really know why. - Really? was actually looking good. - And then they just added egg. - Oh, okay. - Where did the egg inspiration come from? - Yeah, Dej. Where did - I don't remember ever mentioning it. Do we have eggs in our kitchen? - They was making a backup omelette, just in case we light the omelette. - Oh, for... okay. - And then their minds - This is what happens when - You get The Three Islands. - I mean, this bad boy, His asparagus is a bit... - He's on holiday. There's no - Tense. He's limp. - Don't need to be tense. - But the colour of the - Imagine. - I think you did the best presentation. - Your's looks really good. - If you like a rare steak we've... - Hold on, mate. So, the presentation ranking is up to you. Out of 10, what would - I mean, I'd give him a good eight. This is lovely. I mean, that looks like poo. - I told you this would happen. - Get past the poo. - It looks like what it it meant to look like poo. So, I think that's earning us more points. - It doesn't make me wanna eat it? It's like a jungle challenge, that. Uh, four. [gasps] - It looks like poo! - I told you the poo was a bad idea. - Look at the rest of it. It's beautiful. - Can't argue. - Yeah, but there's a poo on the plate. - I told you this. - What does The Three Islands - Surely it's not beating us. - The green bits are people. - Some of them drown? - They're just lying dead in the open. - And did you know that that's not butter? - It's nice. - Have you tried it, yourself? - I've tried it myself and I feel great. [chuckling] - I do not believe you. - So what would you score that out of 10? - I mean, I still have like, come on. I feel bad. - Just don't. I'm giving them a two. - You got two points better - If we hadn't, if it what would you have score ours? - If that had been spread and you had the meat on top to It didn't look like a poo. You could've been at a six or five. - Wow. - So now we have to have the taste test. - The next part. - I'm sorry, guys. - So who does the tasting? [laughing] - You'll be surprised when we have ours. - I think they'll get food poison. - It's all right, that. - It's all right, that. I'll take that every day of the week. - That's pretty good praise as - These are a bit overdone, but I'm not gonna hold it against you. - Overdone? - Mmm. Great. - Can I try that meat? - You don't have to. - It doesn't look safe. - If you can find a bit - You know, I'm a bit worried about it. - I wouldn't touch that, personally. - I'm worried about this thing. - I wouldn't, as in like, be worried. - Would you try it first then I'll try it. - I'll try it first, yeah, of course. - The thing is, they did microwave it. - The steak? - Good? - That's all right. - This guy also ate cow nuts - Yeah, he ate testicles and - Don't trust him though. - He should swollow it first. - It's good. - It's good or it's all right? - It's actually good. - You look like you're having - No. It's good. - I'm gonna cut it and have a look inside. - It's quite nice - See what it looks like. - Kimberly, please have a taste. - Meat is cooked really well. - Honestly, try it. - I promise you. - I feel bad because your of all the of all the plates. - Cooked the best, boys. Cooked the best. - Are you to force yourself - Would you try it? - Here you have a bite. - That's actually not bad. - That's what I'm talking about. I'm gonna eat the whole thing. - Okay, I'm gonna do it. Fine. - Oh no, we've killed her. [laughing] - They're still standing, so. - She tried that over us by - No, I know. We're in big trouble. - The steak is really well done. [gasping] - It's really lovely. - Just beating him. - But... - It doesn't taste like the dish, it tastes more like steak and eggs. - To be fair, They got Potatoes balls. - Egg specialists. You I'm glad I tasted it. That steak was nice. - This on this plate could you taste? - If anything, if there's - The hunk of meat, in - The veg is banging. - Oh, yes. That's something. - The poo, I mean... - Just imagine it's not poo. - Oh god, I'm scared. - Yeah, it's edible but - I wouldn't get seconds. - It's nothing like what - We have to ask you, - Yeah. - A taste score for - I mean, let me see if - There is edible bits, there. There is. - If you've gotta try and then there's, I wouldn't. - But that's all three of them - Tobi had rarer bits - Didn't like it. I - Ethan's been saying try it, try it. - Steak's not good. - Did you sear the steak? - Was the pan hot? - The string is burnt onto the pan. - Just so you know, you can - Yeah. So, okay. They each need a score. Okay. - You can go into negatives, if you need. - I mean, this one, the taste on this one was not that great, but the meat tastes... - Attitude? - You get a four. I dunno if it's gonna get much For taste. I mean, this - Yeah. - That one tasted better. That was a five. - A five. - We've lost. - How about far right? - This had the most about it, but the meat really let it down. But that said like, that let this one down, as well. So, I'm gonna give this one a six. - Oh, okay. - Exactly. We'll take it. We beat somewhat. - You did do that. - On taste. - Should we do a quick judge's score? We're gonna have a separate score. - We'll try. - It is some visionary, - That's quite nice. - Well, it's a four apparently. - The edge. The edge It is just not the meal. - That's a nice big bit. - That meat is so dense. I've had some too, it's lovely. It's very just, nothing to it, guys. Our meat? - He likes it. I can tell he likes it. - The meat's all right. - We have agreed for the judges round. They've got six, for - It tastes so similar in a sense, of what it's supposed to be. - Giving you a five. - And we're giving you a five because your poo lets you down. - Out of everything on this table, the poo is the worst thing. - A shock. - This is salmonella and this is worse. [laughing] I'd rather catch that. - But I think your meat is the worst. - Okay, that's fine. I'll If you had to critique You've got a job to do. So there's that, I guess. Right. Thank you, Kimberly. - Huge thanks to Kimberly - Thank you, guys. Thank you, you too. Try some of that celeriac. - As soon as you brought yours out and I looked at the meat, I said, &quot;oh, my god.&quot; - We did, we ate loads of it. - So, nothing. - Oh yay! That's what I like. Yeah. - And for the final challenge, we have a lovely dessert. However, the boys will They only have access - They will be wearing a large T-shirt to ensure they only use one hand. And again, they have no instruction on how to make the cheesecake. This will take true teamwork, so far, might be a disaster.

We've run out of ingredients. - What's this though? - We've already used that. - Think of it like, a cheesecake. We go you go back to a restaurant. You get a cheesecake. So you get like the butter biscuit base. - Yes. And you get the cheesecake part. - Yes. And it's a layer on top. So, the cheesecake is normally how tall? Let's say you're got cheesecake right now. Your base is this and - It's 2023. It's a - A flat cheesecake. - Oh, it's rising. I think that's probably good. - No, It's not supposed to rise. We shouldn't have put flour in. - Oh my God. It's so sloppy. We made a cake. Made a cake. We made a cake. - Yeah, a cheesecake. - We made cake. A cheesecake. - I think the flour was there - Wait, why did, why Oh man, they put it in oven. - Can I put icing on top - I don't think you I think that's a ruse - Should we have mixed it in there? In what? In this to give it flavouring. - Maybe. It's okay. This will do it. This That's looking good. - f*ck, oh my God. It's delicious.' - Why do we put the flour in? - What this? - Yeah, what is it?

Oreo's on the outside, make a nice little like - Is it a necessary mote? - More like a dam. - I wonder if, maybe that's keep it intact. - Okay. - Just needed a bit more time to set. - We asked for a slice though. - Yeah. Big, big slice. Slice, slice. - We have, we have spoken prior to this and we have agreed on some scores. - Oh wow. - Green team.

If anything, I'd almost like... - Nah, ain't no way, man. - I would actually say, - Are you serious? - But, okay. - So a seven. I was not fair though - However, it isn't a - We did speak and said for presentation if we but we have, so we agreed on a four. - That's a straight nine, It's festive. It's got the strawberries. We cut the Oreos in half put - It looks great. But where's the slice? - It's a big slice. It's a big slice. - It's a big slice. - I think you've used this to overcome... - I think your score, a four, is is a disrespect to the entire video. - The establishment. I think if we're gonna [laughing] They made a f*cking... - But does it taste good? - Ridiculous. - Final scores right now, as it stands, Green team are on 39 points. Red team are on 29 points. - That's not bad.
