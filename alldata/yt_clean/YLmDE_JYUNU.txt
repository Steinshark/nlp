- This week on BuzzFeed of Nicole Brown Simpson Or as you may know it, who was Nicole's ex-husband, a Hall of Fame running back in and the case's top suspect. - Also, I was a little - But you do know a fair amount. - Yeah. I mean for anyone our age, he's just-- - Yeah, I'd actually never I just knew him as the guy who - Yeah. - And his name was The Juice. - His name was The Juice. - There's a lot to unpack here. So, let's just get into it. In the early morning of June the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman were found outside Nicole's Brentwood So right now we're on our way Ugh. - [Shane] Is that it right up there? - That's it over there. I feel awful. - [Shane] Yeah I'm not crazy about this. - No. Look at that face! cheery evening here in Brentwood. - [Ryan] Yeah. (sighing) Oh boy, okay. (groaning) - [Shane] Good times. - At the time, Nicole and and living in separate residences, both located in Brentwood. The bodies were discovered who were literally led to the crime scene by Nicole's dog, (dog barking) a dog that multiple neighbors would around the time of the murders. So like I said, the dog led I'm not sure if it was but the dog led them to the entrance, and they just saw the blood, coming out to the sidewalk. This whole place has been renovated, so the entrance right now than it was back then, but-- - [Shane] You know what is how close all those apartments were. And how it's like-- - [Ryan] And how no one heard. - For some reason, yeah, yeah, I always imagined this street was bigger, and things were a little more separated, but everything's kind of I imagine some people would - That's a good point. I never thought about that. Let's go through the established and highly detailed timeline. On June 12th, 1994, at 6:30 p.m., Nicole, her children, and at a restaurant called Mezzaluna. At 9:15 p.m., Nicole's that her mother had Ronald Goldman goes to At nine to 9:30 p.m. Brian Kato Kaelin and O.J. Simpson go to I can't imagine McDonald's was pleased to hear that. - I know. that out of the testimony. - [Shane] Was that in the testimony? - [Ryan] I mean it had to be. It's on the official timeline. - [Shane] Oof. (Ryan laughing) Well, free, it did get a lot of media coverage-- - I guess. - [Ryan] I suppose. At 9:45 p.m., Kato and O.J. return home from McDonald's. Kato was staying with O.J. in At 9:48 to 9:50 p.m., with a white envelope containing At 10:15 p.m., Nicole Simpson's and cry while he is watching TV. The prosecution would later of Nicole's dog, who is at the murder of its owner, Nicole. - [Shane] They're going by dog bark? - [Ryan] They're going by dog bark. In a lot of ways, this dog, is the real hero of this - [Shane] I don't know if in this one, Ryan. but the dog-- - [Shane] If you wanna give it to the dog, then sure. I'd like to have something - Yeah. is a regular Lassie. For the sake of just let's show a picture I think we could all use that. - Please. - [Ryan] (laughing) Okay. - Hey, something jolly. - Yeah, something jolly. At 10:25 p.m., a limousine at O.J.'s home. O.J. was scheduled to leave from LA to Chicago at 11:45 p.m. At 10:40 p.m., O.J.'s guest, on an outside wall of the From 10:40 to 10:55 p.m., buzzes O.J.'s intercom several times, but there's no answer. Just before 11 p.m., the limo six feet tall, 200 pounds, walking across the At about 11 p.m., the limo driver tries and this time, O.J. answers. O.J. tells the limo driver and had just gotten out of the shower. Doesn't look too good. - [Shane] Doesn't look too good. Could've been a coyote? - [Ryan] (laughing) What? - [Shane] Eh, Los Angeles of coyotes running around. - [Ryan] A six-foot tall By the way, for it being a shadowy figure, this guy seems to have a very - [Shane] I know, yeah. - [Ryan] Six feet, 200 pounds. - [Shane] But very shadowy. - [Ryan] Smelled of McDonald's. At 11:45 p.m., O.J. departs to Chicago. And taking us back to the start, at 12:10 a.m., the bodies and Ronald L. Goldman are stabbed to death. Evidence found at the crime scene included a blood-stained glove left a knitted hat, and a bloody footprint. Detectives would arrive at and would discover some but we'll get into that later. Meanwhile, O.J.'s flight lands in Chicago. According to lead detective Ron Phillips that his ex-wife was dead. O.J.'s first response? Quote, who killed her, end quote. - [Shane] Not good. - [Ryan] Not, how did she die? - Nope. (laughing) Who killed her? - [Shane] Yeah. That's not, that's not the go-to there. (Ryan laughing) - [Ryan] O.J. was questioned but released. On June 17, 1994, four days later, O.J. was charged with but he famously did not and was declared a fugitive. The resulting low-speed police chase of O.J. on the freeways in his white Ford Bronco, is a lasting memory for Do you remember that? - [Shane] I actually don't. I think I was not too on 'cause I was watching (Ryan laughing) - [Ryan] Yeah, that's true, maybe you were just eating - Yeah. taking a dump or something, I don't know. - [Shane] Is that all you did do at that age? was take dumps. - Oh, well. - [Shane] That's a weird childhood. - [Ryan] O.J. was in the passenger seat. The car was being driven who would later explain he that O.J. was apparently in the car, and that O.J. was suicidal. In fact, a suicide note by O.J. was found, but we'll get to that in a bit. So right now, we're going about the speed that O.J. was when the and we're in rush hour traffic, - I thought he was going even slower. - [Ryan] I can't say I Nor do I feel like Vin Diesel. During the chase, they between O.J. and homicide Here's some audio from that. - [Tom] Nobody's gonna get hurt. - [O.J.] I'm the only one that deserves-- - [Tom] No, you don't, deserve that. - [Tom] You do not deserve to get hurt. (O.J. groans) You do Don't do this. - [O.J.] All I did was love Nicole, that's all I did, was love her. - [Ryan] The chase would end Inside the car, they found, in what I imagine was unintentional humor, makeup adhesive, a fake mustache and and a gun. Just try to picture, one of the most famous trying to sneak into TSA and thinking that it's gonna workout. (laughing) I can't believe - [Shane] It's a little juvenile. - [Ryan] O.J. surrendered Let's go over O.J.'s suicide note. Aside from thanking those in his life, O.J. professed his innocence. Quote, &quot;First, everyone understand. &quot;I have nothing to do &quot;I loved her. &quot;Always have and always will. &quot;If we had a problem, it's End quote. And with that, let's Unlike our other cases, this O.J. Simpson. So let's break this Why O.J. is the killer, and why O.J. isn't the killer. Let's start with why First off, let's start O.J. and Nicole Simpson had and around the time of the murders, Nicole and Ronald Goldman had reportedly grown increasingly close, leading some to speculate more than friends, though Goldman said that wasn't the case. That, obviously, is a - [Shane] Yeah, well, I mean, even if Goldman had said that I don't think that's gonna matter-- - No. with her. the guy you shouldn't be worried about. - [Shane] Right, yeah. - [Ryan] Yeah, so. (laughing) In the most extreme case. Now, let's return to the timeline. If the murders did, in fact, occur around 10:15 when as the prosecution suggested, that would give O.J. enough clean himself up, and be back at his house by 11 p.m. to greet the limo driver. Right now we're heading over which was actually only six minutes away from Nicole's townhouse. So. - [Shane] So it's feasible. Especially if he was clippin'. Damn, these houses are nice. - [Ryan] Yeah, these are very nice houses. - That's, I think, it. - That supposedly is it. - Yeah. Oh boy. - [Ryan] So this is the former site of O.J.'s Rockingham Estate. It was demolished in 1998. But, happy to leave. Going into DNA evidence. O.J.'s blood, as well as were found on the glove left Further damning was the fact that this glove matched a glove found within O.J.'s estate near the area where O.J.'s at 10:40 p.m. Both gloves had blood on Goldman, and O.J. O.J. also had a cut on his when the police interviewed him. The knitted hat found at the that were proven to be O.J.'s by the FBI hair and fiber laboratory. Also found at O.J.'s residence Blood was also found in his driveway. The bloody shoe print found at the crime scene matched O.J.'s size, and the sole pattern matched another pair that O.J. owned at the time. O.J. had also purchased a knife, matching the type the coroner Though, the knife and the - [Shane] This is where a lot of people, sorta draw the line, right? - [Ryan] (laughing) When you of evidence that have DNA to the murder. - [Shane] If you're looking at, at the surface here, boy, oh boy. - [Ryan] That's an avalanche of, he done it, right there. - [Shane] Yeah. - So, maybe we should just show just like, yeah, just every time we get sad, we show the picture of the dog. - You wanna bring that up. - Bring that bad boy up. It's right there. - Good. - Good dog. - [Ryan] Another key detail was the fact that O.J. had been a perpetrator of spousal abuse against reportedly resulting in nine police visits to the Simpson residence responding to domestic disturbance calls. In 1989, O.J. was found and plead no contest to the charges. Bizarrely, O.J. himself in 2006 called, If I Did It, a hypothetical account of the murders. Though the book was first it was later published, with the profits going - [Shane] Oh, boy. That's... - [Ryan] Holy shit. (laughing) That's all - [Shane] He just, (Ryan - [Ryan] This guy's got some nads on him, and in the worst way possible. For those that are new to this case, O.J. Simpson was found Despite the DNA evidence the defense team called to the attention of the jury technical mistakes which created some Evidence was not packaged correctly and even left in a van to overheat. This ultimately led to them suggesting that the crime scene may Grasping at straws. I don't know, I'm not a scientist, I'm not a forensic artist-- I know you're not. - [Ryan] Yeah, I mean, in case - [Shane] He is not. - [Ryan] But, from my knucklehead perspective, this looks very bad. During the trial, the defense team had O.J. at the crime scene, and it was too small, Leading to the now famous quote, &quot;If it doesn't fit, - [Shane] Catchy. - [Ryan] He Dr. Seuss'd his Though, it's worth mentioning, the prosecution team was on the glove, because it had been frozen as a preservation method, and it also had been covered in blood. - [Shane] I don't know how - [Ryan] Yeah, I'm not a big, I'm not a glove-freeze artist. - [Shane] No. - [Ryan] Many believe in O.J.'s acquittal due to the events that surrounded the trial. In 1992, race riots occurred and horrific beating of a a beating for which the of all charges. The defense strategically as a reason for O.J.'s charges. They showed a video of Simpson handcuffed, as soon as he returned from in judgment by the police. Perhaps one of their biggest arguments was centered around During the trial, the defense played for the jury a tape of audio was recorded using racial in one recorded sitting. This is noteworthy, because Detective to step inside O.J.'s after the murders occurred, a feat he accomplished of O.J.'s estate. This is a critical detail because, according to Detective it was during this time that he alone discovered the behind O.J.'s guest house. With this information, the that Detective Fuhrman planted the glove, and perhaps all other evidence effectively tainting of whether or not it was true. Christopher Darden, a assigned to the O.J. case Quote, &quot;It will do one thing. &quot;It will upset the black jurors. &quot;It will say, whose side are you on, &quot;the Man or the Brothers,&quot; end quote. The jury was made up one Hispanic person, one white person, and two people of mixed race. All these things considered, the jury reached the verdict of not guilty after less than However, it's worth the eventual civil case of Nicole Brown Simpson with the jury awarding in punitive damages. - This episode is bumming me out, Ryan. - (laughing) Yeah I know. - This is a very depressing case. - This is the worst. But if O.J. didn't kill his then who did? Let's get into some alternate suspects. The first suspect is In an investigation discovery documentary, Clay Rogers, the brother of said that while on death row, his brother Glen confessed to and Ronald Goldman. Though, even if this theory is true, O.J. would still be guilty. Glen Rogers reportedly had been hired by O.J. to steal a pair of but was told to kill her However, it's possible that Rogers was serving at the time of the murders, and thus lied about his involvement. - [Shane] I feel like, people in prison for murder, and serial killers, tend to just-- - [Ryan] Claim things? - [Shane] Yeah, why do they do that? - [Ryan] Sometimes people claim things, in an effort to make themselves in that field, I suppose. are impressed. - No, I'm not impressed. - [Ryan] (laughing) let it sink in. They're gonna see this video, and be like, he's right. Pack it up, you know what, let's, what're we, what're we doing? - Stop it. - You're really hittin' - Stop it. maybe you'll make a difference. - Stop serial killing. - [Ryan] The last O.J.'s son, and is the sole theory of famed private investigator Bill Dear, who is one of the few to be inducted into the Though, it's worth mentioning that many have discredited Dear's case as almost entirely circumstantial. Nonetheless, Dear presents and the highlights are as follows. At the time of Nicole Jason was on probation after with a knife. According to Dear, Jason had also attacked named Jennifer Green. Dear also spoke to of Jason's named Dee Dee, who claimed Jason almost broke into a bathtub and, perhaps cut off her hair with a knife, giving Jason two reported Dear also reportedly obtained illegally, some might add, by dressing up and impersonating a doctor for two weeks, where - I don't like this guy. in hospital for two weeks. - [Shane] People were murdered. (Ryan laughing) And this - [Ryan] I know, but I'm just saying. - [Shane] He's like, woohoo! because he was chasing-- - [Ryan] In his mind, I mean, apparently the Police - [Shane] Is that a real thing? - [Ryan] Yes, it is. - [Shane] I wouldn't be surprised, if it was just him making that up. Him in different costumes, being like, yes, we're a real organization-- - He cuts the video-- - So he talks-- I'm the President. (Ryan laughing) Hey, he looks like that other guy, he just got a mustache. According to Dear, with intermittent rage disorder, and around the time of the murders, Jason stopped taking the This was also during the time when Jason reportedly told doctors he was, quote, &quot;going to rage.&quot; Jason's alibi was that he was working at a restaurant that night. Dear feels this is a flimsy alibi, due to the fact that his timecard is reportedly handwritten, which could suggest it was This reportedly handwritten timecard looks even more suspicious that the electronic time clock at the restaurant was fully Dear also reportedly has pictures of Jason wearing a knitted hat that bears resemblance to of the crime, pictures that only exist and not after. To cap this off, Dear suggests at the scene of the and that this would explain after the murders, such as the infamous Bronco chase. But, as mentioned before, many have discredited Dear's case as almost entirely circumstantial. Unrelated to this case, O.J. was connected to a In the 2008 trial that followed, O.J. was found guilty for 12 counts, including armed robbery and kidnapping, and was sentenced to 33 years in prison. According to CNN, the overall percentage of Americans who believe O.J. did murder Nicole Brown has increased from 66% in 1994, to 83% in 2014. - Certainly, there are Nuanced, very nuanced. - I feel dirty, I feel like And then a bath. - Yeah. - And then another shower. - Yeah. - I need a drink. - Well, thanks Ryan, - Yeah, let's just go. - Yeah. Ouch. Perhaps one day, we will for who is responsible of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman. But for now, the case (eerie ambient music)
