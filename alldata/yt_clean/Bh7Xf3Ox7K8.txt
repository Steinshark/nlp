In this video, we're going to walk right Not only are we going to walk up to it, up to the hot, naughty bits. We've got two liquid engines, They've been in development And not only are we going to right up to it with the guy over the Tory Bruno is a legend He's extremely smart, he's an engineer Here in America, we are right in of aerospace development. There's all kinds of rockets being all these other companies, and they're That we are living in an era they're being flown for the first time. This rocket that we're going to see today the first time it's ever been flown. You may remember in a previous episode the Vulcan Rocket being manufactured. In fact, these are some of the chips that were cutting that ortho-grid pattern They bump form them, they roll them, The rocket that we're about to see launch, Oh, those big plates that you saw machined have to get friction stir-welded together Or in the case of what you first-flight liquid oxygen tank. Okay, so that is the first Right. And now we're going to get The Vulcan rocket is especially important Delta and Atlas class rockets. These are workhorses of the they both have great track records Yes, Tory Bruno is the CEO the first launch of the Vulcan rocket. With all that being said, there's might buy United Launch Alliance. If they do, we don't know who's going We know Vulcan is going to persist, they'll be flying under. All that being said, I want you He is a rocket fan through and through. I've had private conversations, and he is in the industry when the cameras are off. So don't think of as watching a rocket Think about you being able and you're doing it with one of rocket nerds in the country. He's a nerd's nerd, and he's a really fun Another thing that makes this to come along, and he's going to If you've seen my dad in previous I mean, he loves building things, and he So being able to share this with him So let's go to Florida's It's two days before launch. The only way we can fit this in very early in the morning. So we found a patch of time actually, and it's extremely windy. So it was a little difficult of the rocket is just incredible. Let's go get Smarter Every Day learn about the Vulcan rocket. Okay, here we are before sunrise Check this out. That is pretty cool looking. Yeah, the lights make it look amazing. As we drove up on the Vulcan, I was just And to know that we had seen it's just incredible. As we drove up, we had But I also want you to notice towers all around the rocket. This is probably the best shot So remember that for when Also, speaking to Tory, there's a with a cowboy hard hat on. We just got to find him. Oh, we're going mustache today. Someone on the staff has to So it's you. So this is Volcan. Can Can we just go look? I've never seen a BE4. I think I may have seen one at Decatur. We can go right up underneath. Yeah, I'll take you underneath platform. Yeah, come on. Sounds great. You've got the patented Tory hard hat. I think at a certain point, they're going Yeah, once we get to the yellow line Okay, so before we go further here, So we've got We've got the Vulcan here. Let me make sure my focus is working. So we have the Vulcan here. That cable over the top, that's [T] Yeah, so you see the four towers and That is the lightning protection system. It's bigger than it looks. When you look at that inner square, [D] Really? [T] But that is the one thing that They feel like that feels small. But it's not. [D] Oh, it's amazing. [T] It's all four towers. So the four towers are grounded, to these cables that you see So that whole thing is [D] Okay. [T] This tower, that tower, [D] Got it. It's not. Everything's bigger than it looks around here to measure it by. That rocket is 202 feet tall, [D] 20 stories tall? Okay. 4 meters in diameter. Obviously, it's not fueled yet, So we got two solids hanging there. Those are the GEM 63XL, extra long. These are about 7 feet longer than the GEM [D] What does the 63 mean? [T] 63 inches in diameter was the original that these were designed from. These are the longest monolithic [D] So they're not segmented? One piece. [D] Which is good because I didn't know that. I thought these- [T] Yeah, There's no big O-ring joints like or on Artemis's solids. So it's a lot more weight-efficient, so And they're faster to make. It's 109,000 pounds of propellant So that's a lot And all of that, 50 tons of propellant is about a minute and 50 seconds. [D] And their thrust vector, the nozzles- [T] No, two BE cores on the liquid core. So that's enough control authority [D] Really? [D] Okay. Because most solids, like on see on the shuttle, they were gimbled, When we flew the Delta with depending on what we were doing But for these, we don't need that. We got plenty of control [D] Okay. So weaseled dad in here Oh, yeah. That's cool. I think it's hard hat time. Got you. [DAD] I got it. [DAD] All right. I got to get in a picture of your dad. [D] Let's do that. [T] You work James Webb, right? [T] Outstanding. [D] You can hold the camera down, dad. [D] One, two, three. That's great. [T] So you remember the gray part here? That's the MLP or mobile launch platform. You can see the four sets of rails. [T] Yeah. So obviously, the rocket's not fueled with out here, but the mobile launch platform Rockets like 100,000 pounds empty, plus [D] Well, is it pressurized? [T] Only the upper stage. [D] The SENTAR is pressurized right now? Yeah. You either have to have it stretched because it's that very, very thin, So it's a balloon tank. The first stage is rigid. That's that ortho-grid, the rigid structure you saw in the factory. But the upper stage has to be pressurized. And all of this was in the VIF behind you. The doors are closed right now. Yeah, right there. Ula on the top. That's where we assembled to ship this way from Decatur. So the first stage, the upper stage, come separately here on the rocket ship. They go to that building, we stack them stack those, and then the last thing payload, in this case, Paragren, [D] Go into the moon. [D] Which is cool. [D] That's awesome. It's all on top of the So when it's all done, doors open, two and a half miles per hour. [T] Takes a couple of hours to do it clear the building, and then we take off. We're being careful. Somebody asked me the other day, roll from the vif to the pad? And I said, oh, about eight years. Eight years? [D] Yeah, it's a lot of time [T] It was, yeah. So if you go way, way up the topmost one that's a flexible, what we call That's air conditioning. That's for the payload. Temperature, humidity, stuff like that. Certain payloads, especially optical ones, And then below that, as umbilicals for the propellants. You've got umbilicals for all the power until we go to internal power. And then, of course, up there in because it's a 20-story building. [D] That's a mechanical coupling there. [T] Because winds can get [D] Today, it's supposed to. [D] Here, how many hours out are we right now? [T] We're going to go at 2:18 in the morning [D] We're like 30 something hours out. [T] So that's ground wind damper. And then above that was all propellant [D] I see. [T] Then as we come back down, Then this is also different even Artemis or even Delta IV heavy, swing away when it's time to launch. These will disconnect and then fall down so that we don't have that complicated that we do on a Delta IV heavy. [D] How close can we go here? [T] We're going to go until somebody stops us. [D] We're going to go until somebody stops us. All right, I'm switching All right. [T] So you remember the water [D] Yes. [T] For acoustics. So we call that the Acoustic We're going to dump about, I guess we're worth in the first minute here. [T] And that's all about the acoustic energy exhausted and reflect off the ground. Water is almost the best, you material you can have. And the reason that's important is because we'd be pushing 300 decibels. So if the fire didn't get us, the sound [D] Shake us apart. We get massive brain But more importantly... Yeah, more importantly. Without all of that absorption, that rocket and likely damage the spacecraft. [T] That's what it's really about. [D] Can I walk over here to this side? [T] Yeah. [D] We're in a place right now. [T] Yes, we are. This on the bottom goes away. That grading you see, that goes away. And beneath us is the flame trench. [T] And if you look to your right, that's the [D] All the fire goes that way. And out of that thing and It But it's florida, so the lawn [D] Sounds great. [T] And so you can... Those are the two BE4 engines. We're going to get about a million [D] Wow. Grounded, All right, let me Okay, so GEM 63s, they're canted. [D] They're canted out. [T] Yeah, so that way we're getting through the average center of gravity it's moving because we're going to That core will be empty. So we pick the optimal place so that the BE force don't have to fight I was surprised to find out that because a lot of solids on they have nozzles that move so you can But they don't do that on the Vulcan, Look back at the bottom of the rocket. Those two silver things right in engines, oxygen and methane. If we think about what's going on here, They have thrust vector control And what you can do You can vary the thrust so you can I'm going to shoot at you. You can also do things like this. I mean, it's hard to describe, You can even roll the vehicle around, which is fascinating. Now, the design choice they make, They are thrusting the solids you first start, if you look at up the liquid, you load up the solid. It's a very heavy rocket, It's towards the front of the solids the rocket is, and you've got the centaur So the CG is about here. But as you start burning and the CG is going to slowly walk forward. And so you would think, okay, designing the system, I'm just going the CG starts and where the CG ends. And that's where I'm going to And the reason they do that to overpower, so to speak, If you are pushing through the CG of the vehicle and roll pitch or you all You're just trying to add So that's how they do that. The fact that they canted that by the way, three degrees on the solids. If you have a sign of three degrees, that of your total solid rocket thrust, has to be able to handle that compressive And it's even more when you have six I'm sorry, I'm geeking out right now, and it's very interesting. Another thing to think about is a four degree cant on your rocket, twist the vehicle a certain amount. But when you get up five miles and you have less aerodynamic pressure. So that same cantover of the nozzles, response to the vehicle up at altitude. So they're probably not averaging that the end of the CG because the response They probably have an optimized spot, through, which I think is fascinating. It's a very simple, elegant just a fixed nozzle at a certain angle. And it almost makes me empathize and control engineers have trying But we're not going to do that because And everybody knows that solid people, that's where it's at. That's where the cool stuff is. Anyway, obviously, this is an amazing Tory talk about it because I'm learning, [T] And so we'll get about of those solids, plus the 1.1 million So this rocket, it'll weigh just fully fueled at lift off. We'll have about 2 million pounds of like if it had six solids. So you'll see it gently [D] Six solids, that's [T] That's the max, yeah. [D] Is that just a structural limit [T] It's physical space around the rocket. But obviously, the structure we knew that's what it would be. You don't want to waste [D] Let me ask you about the BE4s. I know you wanted those things forever. It took a long time to get them to you. [D] You're excited you got them, right? We love them. My understanding is, and don't with this question, Tory. My understanding is those things of horizontal firing time, My understanding is one or two of vertical thrust time, right? This is what I was asking Tory. A horizontal rocket engine test you horizontally mount that rocket engine and you measure thrust and pressures and A vertical test test is when you like this, and you can test it in the Typically, you want to do that because [T] What's really more important than is how they interact with the rest so much propelling through that thing. Remember, it's going We got 86,000 pounds of LOX. We got 73,000 pounds, gallons, I pounds, 73,000 gallons of methane. All that's gone in five minutes. So the flow rate through And the orientation of the really aren't a driving factor at all. What really matters is how it And of course, that's the one Monday morning when we really test it. So things like Pogo interactions [D] What does Pogo mean? [T] Pogo is the tendency of a long like an organ pipe, except with a liquid. And so that's one of the things we have to fueled space launch vehicles because It's a hundred- [D] Is it like [T] It's water hammer, right. So this thing is oscillating as we're in the rocket engine and we're wants to take all that energy And so we have That's the thing that you really how it interacts with the structure, by the way, of combustion instability. You can have Pogo where the feed to the engine is oscillating because You can get buzz, where the engine that's affecting the flow to the engine. You can get screach, we call. [D] What's it called? [D] Screach. Which is an acoustic phenomenon inside which was one of the problems we had to successfully overcome Screech [D] At what frequencies are we talking about? [D] Thousands of hertz. [T] Yeah, because it's a thing that happens into this combustion chamber, and it's starting to combust, of combustion where it's mixed, It's a tremendous amount of standing waves transverse or radially Not so much longitudinally, That's where the gas has come out. So there's nothing to reflect off of. But those other modes can get going in And if you let that happen, apart in a second or two. [T] So that was part of what took a while to And the way you deal with that screach by carefully controlling your mixing, operate at, but also by putting baffles injector to interrupt that resonance. [D] Just like the Apollo [T] Exactly. Yeah, this is not a phenomenon It was just particularly [D] Why? [T] Because of the chemistry of the methane and oxygen. It just tends to be much In that rough, rapid combustion zone, generated instead of the energy [D] Okay, wow. Stoichiometrically, what are we looking at? Oxygen to- [T] This is close In practice, the stochiometric ratio than that, but you can't have You can back it. I'm not going to tell you But you can guess because I told you the LOX tank and the methane tank. [D] So do you use film [T] Yes. [D] So film cooling is when you [T] Yes. [D] Okay. So it's not a fuel-rich. We do use fuel inside the bells to of the combustion chamber. Is this as far as we can [T] Yeah. [D] So let me zoom in real quick here. I've got... That's Incanel, right? [T] Probably not supposed to tell you. [D] You're not supposed Okay, well, I'm an aerospace engineer, So don't tell me. But I think most... All I know is... I know there's been a lot I do know that. [T] That's a very aerospace Alloy, INCO. X15, right? So we could do our first super- They used that. The reason I bring that up That looks like a heavy engine. [T] It's not a light engine. [D] Okay. [T] I'll say that the weight is not too bad. It's obviously working Then there's a whole program right now with us to continue to and make it more structurally efficient. Because right now, I've researched it just a little bit. I'm not going to pretend I haven't. My understanding is back in the day they would braze tubes in there. You would run the fuel up This one is welded around the outside. You don't have to say [T] Well, we can talk in general terms. [D] Let's talk in general terms. [T] Okay, so you don't use LOX to cool the it's got poor heat transfer properties. You always use the fuel. That's also true here, even though just a better heat transfer element. [D] Is it the heat capacity [T] Both. It is the thermal capacity as well When we look at an upper stage you would still see those brazed tubes, weight-efficient way to circulate that However, that is a handcrafted, craftsman, individually brazing them operation. So ultimately, what you want to move to manufactured channels, even better yet, a lot faster and a hell of a lot cheaper. And so this engine does not have little It's got channels. And even our RL10- [D] Rectacular. [D] Interesting. [T] And even that upper stage, the RL10 will move in our CX upgrade and we'll do away with those tubes. So it cost us a little bit of weight, speed and cost by making it that way. [D] 3d printing? [T] Yes, 3D printing. [D] What's interesting about 3D printing and it will create turbulence inside, [T] You do. That's very good, Destin. I forgot about your fascination [D] That's right. [T] As a matter of fact, we've been specifics about either engine, right? [T] But we've been a little bit surprised that we get superior heat transfer we additively manufacture the channels It's largely due to that phenomenon. [T] Yeah. It's offsetting a little bit the weight that affects performance, especially on is subject to the cube-square limitation [D] That's awesome. It's so good. Tell me about the red paint on the side. [D] You're going to keep it up? [T] We'll do it every so often. So the next launch won't have it because up, and it takes a little bit of time. We do this right now. We do this by hand. We take it in the paint booth gets in there and paints it. And it's not too bad, but it takes The weight's okay. For missions like this, I mean, that's less than a couple But going forward, we're looking at automated sprayers and things so we can the weight margin to do it. You'll see this, every other one, every [D] That's awesome. [T] It's beautiful. But this mobile launch platform is deeper, and it's just a lot more The one we have for Atlas, when and plumbing and data lines and stuff the Atlas one, you're laying on your back You can't get up in there, and it's awful. That thing is built so that It's like being in a submarine, Inside the thing, right here. Yeah. If this were back in the VIF, in there and walk around and do stuff. [D] Is this new? [T] Yeah, this is brand new for Volcan. Whole thing. [T] Yeah. It was so cool to be this close until launch, and all kinds First thing that happened is cryogenic fueling of rockets works. And that's so awesome that I'm Now, cryogenic refueling for the future of space exploration. So I first wanted to understand a rocket here on Earth in 1G. In order to see that, Tory actually let me about the sequence and how you do things. It's a complicated process, even something to be concerned about. So I'm excited to show you If you want to see that, please consider I think you'll dig that. Some other cool things dad We went to the Visitor Center there at That was awesome. That was incredible. We also got to do something that When I was a kid, my dad took me to one ride that has something to do with There's this little dragon, thinking about all your senses and I remember that with my dad wanted to experience that with dad. Now that I'm an adult, I just So we did that. We rode this ride together, It was just me and dad just hanging out. I don't know why, but doing this with dad And when it came time to see the launch, to a large scale rocket launch, and I've We did it this time. Before I show you that, I want This episode of Smarter Every Day Now, Factor is a pretty cool service. They drop these meals off They come in this box that's insulated.

The launch happened really early We were very excited because We had seen it on the launch pad, Dad and I were driven across the base away from the launch pad. There was basically nothing but so the view was amazing. There it is, way out there. We posted up and I got the my best to try to get focus set Here we go. I've got a Phantom Miro right It meant a lot to watch this launch, watching it with my dad. Wow. see when they tank the rocket? Can we figure something out No, we have a plan for you. In fact, I have personally compliant screen for you to watch.
