[Harvey Dent] Years... [Bruce Wayne] No, you don't understand. One fundraiser with my pals, you'll never need another cent. (The Chechen walks through a metal detector manned by two chinese.) (Gotham's most notorious gangsters are sitting around a table. Two burly Chinese carries a TV.) [Crime Boss] The hell is this...? (Lau appears on the TV) [Lau] As you're all aware, one of our deposits was stolen. A relatively small amount: 68 million. [Chechen] Who's stupid enough steal from us? [Sal Maroni] Two-bit whack-job... wears a cheap purple suit and make-up. He's not the problem- he's a nobody. The problem is... our money being tracked by the cops. [Lau] Thanks to Mr. Maroni's well-placed sources, we know that police have indeed identified our banks using marked bills... and are planning to seize your funds... today- And since the enthusiastic new D.A. has put all my competitors out of business, (Gordon hurries up the steps to a bank. swat teams rush the various banks.) I'm your only option. [Sal Maroni] So what do you proposing? [Lau] Moving all deposits to one secure location. Not a bank. [Gambol] Where then? [Lau] No one can know but me. If the police were to gain leverage over one of you... everyone's money would be at stake. [Chechen] What stops them getting to you? [Lau] I go to Hong Kong. Far from Dent's jurisdiction. And the Chinese will not extradite one of their own. [Sal Maroni] How soon can you move the money? [Lau] I already have. (A chinese man finishes loading a tractor trailer with cash boxes. The truck pulls out into a convoy.) For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait for your permission. Rest assure it. Your money is safe. (Gordon stands in an almost empty bank vault. Furious.) (From the back of the room comes laughter. It grows and grows, until it fills the room. All eyes turn: The Joker.) [Joker] And I thought... my jokes were bad. [Gambol] Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my boy here pull your head off. [Joker] How about a magic trick? (Joker slams a pencil into the table, leaving it upright.) I'm gonna make this pencil disappear. (Joker grips Gambol's bodyguard's head and slams it, face down, onto the table ...) (The bodyguard slides off of the table. The pencil is gone.) Ta da! It's... It's gone. Oh. And by the way the suit, it wasn't cheap. You ought to know you bought it. (Gambol gets up) [Chechen] Sit! I want to hear proposition. (Joker points Chechen then look back to Gambol) (Gambol sits back) Let's wind the clocks back a year. These cops and lawyers wouldn't dare... cross any of you. I mean... What happened? Your... your balls drop off? Hmm? Yo.. you see a guy like me... [Gambol] A freak. (Gangsters laughs. Which the Joker tries to ignore.) Guy like me... Look. Listen. I know why you choose to have your little... (Coughs) group therapy sessions in broad daylight. I know why you're afraid to go out at night: The Batman. You see Batman has shown Gotham your true colors... unfortunately. Dent, he's just the beginning. And... and as for the television's so-called plan- Batman has no jurisdiction. He'll find him and make him squeal. I know the squealers when I see them... and... (Points at Lau) (Lau ends his conversation.) [Chechen] What do you propose? [Joker] It's simple. We kill the Batman. (Gangsters laughs.) [Sal Maroni] If it's so simple, why haven't you done it already? [Joker] If you're good at something never do it for free. [Chechen] How much you want? [Joker] Ahh.. Half. (Gangsters laughs. The Joker shrugs. Rises.) *You're crazy* I'm not. No, I'm not. If we, don't deal with this... now. Soon little Gamble here won't be able to get a nickel for his grandma. (Gambol slams the table) [Gambol] Enough from the clown! Ta ta ta ta... Let's not blow... (Joker opens his coat, revealing explosives wired to his chest. Gambol stops.) *Shit* this out of proportion. [Gambol] You think you could steal from us and just walk away? [Joker] Yeah. [Gambol] I'm putting the word out- 5 hundred grand for this clown dead. A million alive, so I can teach him some manners first. (The Joker shrugs. Turns to rest of the gangsters.) [Joker] Alright. So listen, why didn't you give me a call... when you want to start taking things a little more seriously? Here's my card. (Joker puts his card on the table) Hh... Hh.. (Gambol stares at the Joker.) (Joker leaves by kicking the door.)
