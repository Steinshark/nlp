This time, it's a 7-day fishing trip around Miyagi and Iwate. I'll be driving long distances, so I'll refill my coffee before getting on the highway. I'll be filming in a casual vlog style this time. I want to enjoy my first long trip, so please allow me to film in a way that isn't too burdensome. I'm only buying ice. I often buy plastic bags because they become trash bags. I added an in-car refrigerator and an aluminum container for the long trip. My favorite Stanley mug lately. It has a large capacity of 880ml (a bit pricey at around 6800 yen). I used to buy coffee from convenience stores or Starbucks every time. With UCC iced coffee (96 yen) and half of rock ice (about 110 yen), I can make a large amount of iced coffee. The items are expensive, but the cost performance is great. It has a handle and a straw, making it easy to drink while driving. The in-car refrigerator is the BougeRV I bought last year. It's going to be very useful this time. The sun is hitting, and the driver's seat is hot... I'm heading north to escape the heat. I forgot to charge, so it's barely alive. I'll do my best with driving charging. First, it's 423km to the fishing spot. Today will mostly be driving. I noticed there's a charging port here. I'll charge the GoPro battery. I never noticed it before. It's a bit uplifting. About this trip, it's a fishing and sightseeing trip. I haven't decided on anything else, including the destinations. I'll speed on the highway until around Sendai City. I haven't decided yet, but if I go further north, I'll use the Sanriku Road, the longest free highway in Japan. The outer ring road is often crowded even on weekdays, so I honestly don't like it. But I like driving on the highway. It feels a bit cluttered, so I'm planning some additional DIY. The countryside atmosphere is coming out. It's raining on and off. After driving for about two hours, I arrived at Nasu Kogen SA in Tochigi. I'll take a break and have lunch. It revived a bit with the driving charge. Since the altitude is high, it's much more comfortable than the lowlands. This soft serve with cheesecake looks delicious. I chose a set of ramen and Utsunomiya gyoza (1200 yen). Cold water (free is awesome). The char siu is huge...! Itadakimasu. I also got the soft serve (630 yen). It's very rich and creamy. The combination of cheesecake and soft serve is great. From here, I'll drive for about another four hours. I want to decide where to get off the highway based on the bath location. This looks good. I'll go here. I'll get off the highway at Murata Interchange, just before Sendai City. Since it's a regular car, the toll is 7160 yen. I regret a bit not leaving at night for the midnight discount. The sun has almost set. I was shocked (lol) The car floated. I didn't see the bump at all (lol) I arrived at the hot spring. In this season, it's bothersome that bugs stick when driving on the highway. Should I remove them immediately? Ton-ton Shrine? It seems to be related to pig farming. There's a lot of love for pigs (lol) I put clothes in the new trunk. Entry is prohibited due to wild boars. The atmosphere is a bit scary. &quot;Tennen Onsen Ii Yu&quot; (Natural Hot Spring Good Bath) The food looks delicious too. Well then, let's go inside. The admission fee was 500 yen. There are various amenities like towels. Shampoos are provided in the bath. It seems that the men's and women's baths switch daily. I can't film inside the bath, so here's a picture. A signature of rugby player Michael Leitch. My dad loves rugby. It seems you can interact with capybaras during the day. It's cool as the sun sets. I keep my laundry in the box, The ceiling light is an adjustable light from Ikea. In this season, it's quite tough to travel in a car without a refrigerator. I'm looking for a place to stay for the night. Since I want to fish, it will naturally be by the sea. I've decided on a destination, so let's go. I found a restaurant that looks delicious along the way. The next drive is long, so I'll have my meal here. &quot;Manten Shokudo.&quot; I was attracted by the sign saying &quot;Unlimited Rice.&quot; It's a touch panel ordering system. My intuition was right. This place was a hit. Under 1000 yen for this amount is too cheap. I chose the recommended Chicken Nanban (828 yen). It seems you make the tartar sauce by crushing the eggs yourself. I've never seen this tool before. Once you get used to it, you can crush them easily. Dropping the calorie bomb! Itadakimasu. You can have unlimited rice refills and make ochazuke. There were also unlimited pickles. But it's cash only. But I feel like they provide it cheaper because of that. It was a great place. Let's head to the destination again. The night view of Sendai is beautiful. I'll stay at Murohama Fishing Port tonight. I'll fish there tomorrow. Arrived. The fishing port at night is pitch dark. I'll put up the sunshade. The portable power station is at 55%. Although I drove for a long time, To be honest, I'm worried about the power shortage. I'll turn on the ventilation fan. The window outside the ventilation fan has a screen. On the passenger side, I'll roll out the screen. It looks like this from the outside. When I sleep, I close the window. On the other side, you can't see much unless you peek closely. I had a nice chat with a local night fisherman. According to him, you can't catch bluefish like yellowtail at this port. I was able to ask about a point where yellowtail is being caught now. He kindly taught me. I'm grateful for the chance encounter. However, that place is about an hour from here. It's already 10 pm, so I'm honestly unsure. But since he kindly told me, I'll move. It's about an hour from here, called Onagawa Port. Looking at the map, it certainly seems like a place where you can catch fish. Not only the Sanriku Road, but the roads around here are beautiful and easy to drive. The reason for that will be revealed later in the video. I'll buy breakfast and drinks for tomorrow at the convenience store. Arrived at Onagawa Port. I'm exhausted from the big move. Good night. Good morning. It's 4 am. I was too excited and only slept for about 2 hours (lol) Thinking about catching a big one, I couldn't sleep. From here, I'll walk a bit to the breakwater. The utility pole is tilted sideways. Is it due to the tsunami 13 years ago? Actually, Onagawa Port was one of the places most affected by the tsunami. A 20-meter high tsunami took many lives. I climb up an abandoned ladder to a high place. It's a very beautiful port. I'll set up my tackle for catching big fish. The sunrise is very beautiful. There's a flock of birds. There must be a school of fish under them. But they are very far away (lol) Many fishing boats are leaving from the back of the port. I keep casting the lure... But nothing bites (lol) Tuna mayo onigiri. I'll have breakfast while looking at the scenery. The morning prime time ended, so I'll go back to the car (lol) It was a nice place. My fishing skills weren't good enough. It's the season for bugs... I'll check out a nearby roadside station. Charge the GoPro, and let's go! It took about 5 minutes to get here. Roadside Station Onagawa. There's a terrace seating area with a nice atmosphere. Oh, it looks nice? There are a lot of local seafood products. I found Onagawa's inada (young yellowtail)! It was just my lack of fishing skills (crying) They also seem to be recruiting residents. There's a fireworks festival in the summer! If you're interested, please come! The toilets were very clean. It's still early in the morning, so other stores are not open yet. The dining place opens in about 30 minutes. You can see the port and the sea from the terrace seating. I'll kill time in the store until it opens. It opened. It's a seafood bowl restaurant. There are many celebrity signatures. Momoiro Clover Z Wacky Keroro Gunso was also there. I got a seafood bowl. I'll put it in the refrigerator and eat it for lunch. Let's head to the next destination. I need some supplies, so I'll head to a fishing gear shop. Arrived. Yay. I bought lures and spike shoes. I needed spike shoes because I'll be debuting at the rocky shore tomorrow. I realized there are limits to fishing from the breakwater. Before heading to the next destination, I'll stop by the gas station. This Hiace is a 4WD diesel vehicle. I spilled it on the car (crying) It's 146 yen per liter. Six months ago, it was around 120 yen. Yen depreciation (crying) This time, it was 6400 yen. With a full tank, it can run about 560km. I want to refill myself too, so I'll stop by the convenience store. I'm only buying ice. It fit perfectly. Now I can run 560km too. For now, I'll head to Roadside Station Otani Coast. Here it is. It took about an hour. I feel like I see a lot of camper vans. Since it's close to the sea, I'll go have a look. It's well-maintained. Seeing the seagull flock makes me want to fish. I bet they're conducting fish farming experiments in that building. I'll eat the seafood bowl I bought earlier. This seafood bowl is the most basic type and was 1500 yen. It looks more voluminous in person than in the video. Pour soy sauce on it Itadakimasu. Can you tell how huge this scallop is? I feel like the other ingredients are also large. After eating lunch, I got sleepy. I didn't get much sleep, so I'll take it easy today. I'll go to a bath early and prepare for fishing tomorrow. I've arrived. &quot;Kesenuma Hokkori Yu.&quot; I store clothes in the new trunk. Previously, I stored them in a box on the roof rack, so going to the bath has become much easier. The bathhouse is attached to a pachinko parlor, and the entrance was on the other side. It seems to have been built recently. It's very clean. This looks promising for a hot spring too. It was beyond my expectations. Since there aren't many hot springs around here, I want to use it again. I keep my laundry in the box. From here, I head to Rikuzentakata City. During the earthquake 13 years ago, the entire town was engulfed by the tsunami. About 25,000 people died in the tsunami. This Sanriku Road is the longest free highway in Japan, built in an astonishingly short period of 10 years, with the aim of early recovery from the earthquake. Considering that the area we're driving through now was also affected by the tsunami,this scenery is astounding. I'll get off at Rikuzentakata Nagasobu Interchange. I can see the townscape of Rikuzentakata City. Since this entire area was engulfed by the tsunami, there are hardly any buildings. This is a roadside station, but it also serves as an exhibition hall for the Great East Japan Earthquake. I've arrived. I feel a very solemn atmosphere. Over there, you can see &quot;Kiseki no Ipponmatsu&quot; (The Miracle Pine). During the earthquake, this area was a beautiful pine forest. This pine tree was the only one that wasn't washed away by the tsunami. The buildings affected by the tsunami are preserved as monuments. It seems this was a hotel. Gassho (hands in prayer). At the time of the earthquake, I was a high school student in Kyushu, during after-school club activities. I remember being glued to the TV, watching the footage of the tsunami. At that time, I lamented my own helplessness. Even now as an adult, that hasn't changed, and showing you all this footage is the only thing I can do. I'm grateful for being alive today. I'm heading to the place where I'll stay tonight. I'll buy food at a local supermarket. Since it's humid, I feel like eating something spicy. I'll also buy some alcohol and snacks. Since I'll be fishing early tomorrow morning, I'll buy some onigiri. Oh! They use local Sanriku seaweed &amp; it's discounted. &quot;MAIYA&quot; had a great selection. I'll stay at the tip of Karakuwa Peninsula tonight. This morning, a fisherman next to me recommended it. The road gets narrower as I approach the tip of the peninsula. Oh, I spotted a raccoon dog. Tonight's destination is beyond this torii gate. I asked the shrine priest in advance if it's okay to stay the night for fishing. The shrine at night has a heavy atmosphere...! It feels like ghosts or yokai might appear...! For dinner, I'll just eat the side dishes I bought earlier. I don't cook much the night before fishing since I want to sleep early. Cheers. It's refreshing and easy to eat. I like this aluminum box because I can put things on top of it. I can lock the lid, so it's safe even while driving. I'll use the wooden bowl I bought recently. Pringles sour cream &amp; onion flavor. My favorite. Tonight's feast is decided. Since I have to get up early tomorrow, I'll sleep now. Good night. Good morning. It's 5 am. I'll head to the fishing spot right away. It feels like I can catch fish. Today is my debut at the rocky shore. Amazing... I'll carefully descend the rocky area. I'll use this flat spot as my fishing place. I've prepared a lot for today. For safety, I'll wear a life jacket and spike shoes while fishing. First cast. Please, fish. For the video too, I want to avoid no bites for two consecutive days (lol) The people who mainly do fishing on YouTube are really amazing. I keep casting for a while... But no bites (lol) I'll take a break and eat breakfast. An onigiri with local seaweed. I feel like the onigiri catches more than the lures. After resuming, the first cast. Finally, the moment comes... Got it! I had set the drag very tight, but it was pulled out. It's a big fish. I can't help but shout. What? The hook came off...! Despair (lol) I'm disappointed, but I'm happy that a fish bit. I kept casting after that, but... No fish bit. The fish that got away was big. But I feel like I got a step closer to catching a big one. Someday, I want to show you all the moment my dream comes true. However, the road to catching a big one is far. The sun is up, and it's scorching hot. Even the cats were hiding under the bus or in the shade because of the heat. A serow appeared on the road I just passed. I thought they lived in high mountains, but they're also near the sea. It's very hot, so I'll do some car customizations for heat measures. I'll move to a place where I can work. I came to a nearby park. I'll customize a rare type of rear sunshade. This time, I rented a product called Shinshade from Shinplus. In conclusion, this sunshade was very useful during this summer car trip. However, I think some people are not interested in customizations at all. For those people, please skip to the next part. These are the contents of the product. The silver rods are the sunshades. The bag contained a screwdriver to attach the sunshade, By the way, there are also installation videos on YouTube. I recommend the videos because they are easier to understand than the paper instructions. It's a type of sunshade that attaches to the sun visor and stays in place, so at first, I struggled a bit to understand the parts' structure. However, after watching the Shinshade YouTube video, I was able to attach it smoothly. After attaching the parts to the sunshade itself, I'll attach the sunshade to the sun visor. At this time, it's important not to strip the screw holes. This Hiace can seat three in the rear seat, which is convenient in such situations. Similarly, I'll attach it on the other side. The attachment parts with the sun visor look like this. I'll actually deploy the sunshade. Oh, it can be deployed in an instant. The outside is made of aluminum material, reflecting heat and light. With one button, it automatically retracts and stores. Personally, I liked this automatic retraction feature. You can create shade instantly. It looks like this when enlarged. One clear disadvantage, depending on the position of the rearview mirror, it may interfere with the sunshade. It looks like this when the sun visor is deployed. It looks neat and tidy. Today, I'll travel while testing the performance of this sunshade. I'm looking forward to it. From here, I'll go sightseeing at Chusonji Konjikido for about 1 hour and 30 minutes. I'll refill my iced coffee before departure. For long-distance driving, I'm getting into the habit of filling my Stanley mug with lots of iced coffee. I've learned that this one cup of ice is enough. This is convenient. I stopped by Roadside Station Murone on the way. I see the words &quot;Japan's best.&quot; Japan's best karaage~? They say that again. I won't be fooled. I ended up buying it. Because it looked so delicious. It's delicious (lol) The words &quot;Japan's best&quot; weren't a lie (lol) By the way, about this sunshade, it's very nice to be able to create shade easily. You can block direct sunlight while running the air conditioner. I'll also check the temperature changes in the car later. I arrived at Chusonji's parking lot. Because I was running the air conditioner, the dashboard area is 21.4degC. From this state, I'll check how the temperature changes by using the sunshade. It's just before 3 pm. It's the hottest time of the day, with the sun directly overhead. While sightseeing at Chusonji, I'll experiment to see how much the temperature changes. The approach path is shaded and very cool. It feels like time is flowing differently here. Here at Chusonji, the golden temple &quot;Konjikido&quot; is famous, but there are also 17 other temples within the vast grounds, and many rare things that can only be seen here. To tour Konjikido, you need a 1000 yen admission fee. The golden temple is off-limits for photography. So, see you later. Konjikido was gleaming. It was impressive. On the way back, I was greeted by the cats. I'll offer my grooming services. Now, how's the temperature? 33degC, huh. It doesn't seem to have much effect on suppressing temperature rise. However, considering it, no matter how excellent the sunshade, Being able to create shade easily. Protecting the dashboard from direct sunlight. Especially the first point, the ease of making shade is good. While eating lunch, I'll do some editing work in a cafe. I like &quot;Komeda Coffee&quot; because they have power outlets and the food is delicious. For lunch, I ordered a mini plate with filet cutlets. I usually do my video editing myself. On the way here, I customized a screen for the sliding door. I'll introduce this screen customization in another video. Next, I'll go to a slightly unusual place to take a shower. Here it is. I'll take my change of clothes and toiletries. I'll take a shower at this gym. With Anytime Fitness's 1100 locations nationwide, they're usually in the cities I visit. For a monthly fee of 7000 yen, you can use the gym and showers as many times as you want. I originally went to a gym near my home, It saves on shower costs and helps alleviate lack of exercise while traveling. The shower room is simple but very clean. I exercised, took a shower, and felt refreshed. There was a supermarket nearby, so I bought some side dishes for dinner. Got dinner and drinks. In summer, I can't manage without a refrigerator. Tonight, I'll stay at Roadside Station Mizusawa. I've arrived. I like the current interior, but This screen can be rolled up and stored when not in use. Since it's hot when closed, I'll keep the small window open. On the other small window side, I can run the ventilation fan. I'll eat the side dishes I bought earlier. Sashimi of bigeye tuna from Miyagi Prefecture. Salad 150 yen (half price) Homemade lightly pickled cucumbers. Itadakimasu. This is delicious. Gochisosama. How was this different adventure? I'll upload the second part later, so please check it out. I plan to do some DIY soon to go on a trip with my wife too. I'm very grateful for my wife always supporting me. See you in the next video. Thank you for watching. Good night.
