i will be starting in-person classes here in asheville north carolina soon if you would like to join and attend an in-person class here in asheville north carolina please click on the silicon dojo meetup link down below welcome back as you know i am eli the computer guy and in today's class we're going to go over tcp ip version 4 subnet masking now before you try to run away in horror or you try to crack a beer to drown the misery your brain is about to go through one of the things i want to explain to you is that subnet masking is not actually very difficult subnet masking is actually pretty simple and frankly in the modern world where you have things like cheat sheets it's a it's it's something relatively easy to implement and to deal with but it's one of those things that the human brain just has difficulty dealing with subnet masking is the perfect example of why technology professionals get paid a lot of money to do simply what seems to be simple tasks when you look at subnet masking it seems to actually be a pretty simple task but for some reason when most people take a look at it their brains melt their brains melt so if you can understand subnet masking then you can go out there and you can make money because you can do things that are actually pretty simple that make other people's brains melt and so therefore they need your services so today again we've talked about in the past we've talked about the ethernet technology we've talked about tcpip version 4 in general so today what we're going to be talking is about subnet masking and why subnet masking is important so the first thing that we have to keep in mind when we start talking about subnet masking is to think about what tcpip version for the problem that it's trying to solve and the problem that tcp version 4 is trying to solve is your ability to manually configure a network so that you can constrain what computers or devices or servers can talk to what other computers and devices and servers again when we talk about layer 2 networking technology again we're talking about switches switches use mac address media access control addresses to identify all of the computers that are connected to the switch and in that world again more or less those mac addresses are hard coded to the hardware so you as an administrator you as a as a network professional really can't do a lot of manual administration so what tcpip version 4 allows you to do is this allows you to manually configure networks to essentially say who should be talking to who else who shouldn't be talking to who else and the whole nine yards right so that's an important thing just to keep in mind when we start talking about tcpip version 4. now when you see an address so normally i'll talk about this like 192.168. right this is the ip address one of the important things to understand about an ip address is this is not simply the identifier for the computer or device on the network again the server the computer the print server whatever else this also has a network identifier in the ip address so one portion is the network identifier the other portion is the computer identifier so essentially the first component is an identifier for the network and the second component is the identifier for the computer itself this is very important because remember tcpip version 4 is a routable protocol you were able to separate a different networks using a router and so that router sends communication between different networks and so computers actually have to be on a different network for the routers to work right so if we have our switch here and we have all of these computers connected to the switch and this is 192.168.1.x i'll explain this in later uh and this you know connects to a router which then connects to another switch right if this if this network over here is 192.168.1.x if these are the same networks right if you have manually configured this to be the same network then basically this router is not going to function properly because you have the same network on either side it will fail so what you need to do is you have one network over here that's 192.168.1.x that gets connected to a router that then connects to another switch and this could be 192.168.2.x right it is a different network so when a computer on this network tries to communicate can't find the computer it's looking for in this network it will then go to the default gateway which is essentially the router the router will then route that traffic to the network that it's connected to and it will be able to find the computer that it's looking for so that's one of the important things to be thinking about when we're talking about these ip addresses is that the network component is very important especially when you're dealing with routers because if you if you set up if you manually configure the router to essentially have the exact same network on either side of the router you're going to run into problems and where this can be a real issue especially with new people right is you have your switch here and on your switch you have dhcp and you have dns and you have active directory and you have all your host computers right but that's 192.168.1.x one of the issues is people just aren't thinking about it and so they have you know dns on this side they have dhcp on this side and so dhcp will not go through the router dhcp is dynamic host configuration protocol this is what dynamically assigns ip addresses to the different computers on your network so that won't get routed through the through the router basically the router will be the wall for dhcp and so you can run into a real issue where you have these two networks that somehow got manually configured to be the exact same tcp and network number and then your router is is going to fail because it's not able to route traffic one of the other things to be thinking about this is not prominent in the 2020s uh but again do remember when we're talking about ethernet and we're talking about tcpip one of the biggest problems here is we're dealing with 50 year old technology remember xerox came out with ethernet in 1973 look at what the current date is and do some math and realize how long ago that was so when ethernet first came out a lot of the tools and a lot of the ways that we architect the networks nowadays just simply didn't exist before so one of the things that they want to do in the past especially when they're dealing with hubs remember hubs all hubs are are splitters right basically all your computers connect to a hub and then when one computer wants to communicate with another computer the traffic goes into the hub and out every single other port on that hub and essentially it generally becomes a disaster because you get something called a broadcast storm and it's very horrible it was wonderful i mean in 1973 it was cutting edge technology not so much anymore but one of the things back then when networking equipment was very expensive and the whole nine yards one of the things i thought is hey what if we want some computers that are connected to a hub to be able to communicate with each other but we don't want those computers uh to be able to communicate with other computers that are connected to the hub and so that's one of the things with that network identifier 192.168.1.x right basically you could create this network for these computers and then you have 192.168.2.x this would be the network for these computers over here so although they are physically connected to the same essentially a splitter is essentially a splitter at that time they would not with tcpip version 4 they would not be able to communicate with each other we are logically splitting the network uh you may have wanted this in the past for any number of reasons uh maybe maybe these computers were for like the lab so maybe you had a computer lab and these computers were for the administrators and they connected them all to the same switch yeah and not a smart idea in the modern world but again if you go back to 1973 that that might made a might might have made uh half a bit of sense and so basically with the network identifier you can tell computers essentially who they should or should not communicate with in order to have 192.168. be able to communicate with computers on 192.168.2.x you actually then have to put a router in between and essentially the router will route the traffic between the two networks one of the important things to think about here though and this again this is where things get really kind of sort of stupidly complicated in the technology world is if you have a hub so if you have a hub and this is a splitter so when a computer 192.168.1.x wants to communicate with another computer on 192.168.1.x that communication will go in to the hub so the hub is just a dumb splitter from 50 years ago that would actually go out every single port on that hub only only 192 the the computer in the 192.168.1.x network will actually respond uh to the communication but it is important to understand that all that traffic would be going out uh to every other port on that hub and so that's where if you had both of these uh these subnets essentially on the same hub you can run into communication problems you're like oh no but this is one network and this is one network so they won't screw with each other it's like sort of sorta you can run into problems when i am talking about this uh if you uh if you know a little bit about technology it's important to understand i am not talking about vlans vlans is where you can virtually divide your physical switch into uh different vlans so vlan 1 and vlan 2. this is not this is not a vlan type thing this is not a ethernet this is not a data link layer an osi model layer 2 issue this is all about doing the configurations up at that tcp ip4 level so basically that's some of the things to be thinking about here so when we talk about the ip address and we talk about the network component and we talk about the computer identifier it's important to understand that the network identifier says what network the computer is on that it's communicating with for one network to communicate with another what network you need a router in the middle if both networks on either side have the same identifier it will fail so basically a router has to be used to communicate uh between two different networks so this is 192.168.1.x and this is 192.168.2.x so those are two different networks so routing can occur and if you really want to create a disaster you know using your switch or hopefully you don't have a hub at this point you can actually separate the communication of all of your computer vice devices connected to that hub or switch simply by putting them onto different subnets so now the question is is when you're looking at this ip address and it's 192.168.1.10 how do i know as a technology professional that the network identifiers 192.168.1 dot x as we say and the computer identifier is that 10. how do we figure that out we understand that by using something called a subnet mask so whenever you you go into your computer settings and you pull up your your ip configuration settings you're going to see your ip address and right under that you are going to see your subnet mask so for 192.168.1 uh let's say 10 basically this is called a class c subnet and so the subnet mask would be 255.255.255.0. [Music] and so what this shows us once we understand how the numbering scheme works is essentially that 255.25.255 that shows me that 192.168.1 that is the network identifier and then wherever the zero is that shows me that that's the computer identifier on the other side of that and so basically if you're looking at this from a real cursory example let's say the 10.1 network so uh 10.1.10.5 right this is considered a class a network the subnet mask for class a is 255.0.0 and so basically what i can do is i can take a look at this and go okay i see the 255 stops here so everything that is above the 255 that is the network identifier everything that is 0.0.0 that is the computer identifier and so very simply what the subnet mask shows you is it literally shows you where where the network identifier ends and when where the computer identifier begins so at this point you're probably thinking well this is pretty simple i don't understand why people's brains get melted right okay so this is two five five thing so basically whenever i see the two five five that means what's above it for the ip address that's the the network identifier and wherever i see the zero that would be the computer identifier so there's something called a class c subnet and there's something called a class a subnet but that all that all seems to make a lot of sense why why would anybody's brain melt over something like this but but one of the things that's probably going through your head what is this two five five thing like why why two five five not why not five thousand and twenty five why not ten where does this number come from and that number comes from the place where that's going to melt your brain so whenever we're taking a look at this again we'll see these numbers right 10.1.10.5 right these numbers actually come from something called an octet so you have four octets what an octet is is a string of bits bits are either zero or one they're on and off so when you look at 255.0.0.0 or 10.1.10.5 basically these are four octet so octet is one two three four five six seven eight dot one two three four five six seven eight dot one two three four five six seven eight dot one two three four five six seven eight right so let's just imagine that's all actually all separated out and so when you take a look at these numbers like 255 so 255.0.0.0 what that is is one 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 and 0 all the way to the end right so that's actually how we get to the number of 2 5 5 is essentially by counting up these bits but then you sit there but i don't understand so you have a bunch of ones you have eight ones so that should be eight right where'd you get two five five from r stand okay so now let's go and take a look at the actual octet itself so we got one two three four five six seven eight right so this this is an octet the octet again each one of these uh these dashes essentially represents either a zero or a one and then they have a number identifier so on the right hand side oh is that for you anyways over here i'll just put it this way over here uh this starts with the identifier of one then it goes to two then it goes to four then it goes to eight then it goes to 16 then it goes to 32 then it goes to 64 and then it goes to 128 right and so if we say 1 so when we say 192.168.1.1 right if we're trying to see this in the bits of an octet what that would be is this would be one and all the rest of these would be zero so when you're going through and you're counting up the numbers like not 128 not 164 one not what not 32 oh okay so one so okay so that's how we represent this when we talk about a subnet mask of um oops subnet mask of two five five two five five is where these are all ones and so you add 128 plus 64 plus 32 plus 16 plus 8 plus 4 plus 2 plus 1 and then that is what gets us to the 255 there and so this is how the octets work and when we're looking at this numbering system so if you go here let's say you're looking at 190 let's see so [Music] 192.168.01. you know uh 25 so if we take a look at this at one two three four five six seven eight one two four eight uh 16 32 64 128 right so we take a look at this if we're trying to figure out the the bit in the octet how to represent 192 then it would be 1 4 128 and 1 464 and then 0 for everything else and then that should get us to a 192. right if we go back and we look at 168 let's see if i can do my math properly uh so let's see so that would be 128 um plus plus uh horrible math 20 no it's not 80. so it wouldn't be that so that would be zero uh 128 plus 32 so 128 so that would be 30 that would be 60. so that gets us to 160 then this would be zero then this would be one zero zero zero right so 128 128 plus 32 plus 8 i think gets us to 168. if that is wrong it's not the technology it's my really crappy math right um and that's how we're able to identify this in bits this this will matter in a little bit when we go into subnet masking again when we look at one so again that would be zero all the way across just the identifier over here for one if we're looking at 25 right so uh 25 would be 16 plus 8 would be 24 again plus 1 would be 25 so the identifier for 25 would be 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 and that's how we use the octets to get to these different numbers and so each each one of these numbers here so 192 is represented by an octet 168 is represented by an octet 1 is represented by an octet 25 is represented by an octet same is true with the subnet mask and again we do oops we do 255.255.255.00 [Music] as a subnet mask there's actually octets here so 8 8 8 8. right and so this is how we come up with the numbering scheme for these octets and then once you understand that we're going to go to how the actual subnet masks work and hopefully this will make a lot more sense so at this point we understand an ip address contains both the network number and the computer number or the device identifier for the network we also understand that the subnet mask is what tells us where does the network identifier end and the device identifier begin and i just explained to you how the octet numbering system works now let's bring this all together so that you can see how the subnet mask actually works when you're looking at these octets so that you can understand this you know when you start dealing with uh with tcp networking in the future right so okay so oops let me do this so we have a 192.168.1.1 so this is the ip address and then that has a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 right and so we know simply because i've told you then that means that this 192.168.1 is the network identifier and the one is the computer identifier how this works out with the octets right so we have the ip address octet so it's one two three four five six seven eight dot one two three four five six seven eight dot one two three four five six seven eight dot one two three four five six seven eight let's just hope there's eight in there anyways now we have the subnet mask right so the mat the subnet mask is underneath one two three four five six seven eight dot one two three four five six seven eight dot one two three four five six seven eight let's say dot one two three four five six seven eight so when you're looking at the subnet mask essentially the network identifier ends where the ones end so if we have a what is called a class a subnet mask i'll talk about this in the future basically for the subnet mask you would have one two three four five six seven eight right and then everything else would be zero so if that's the case we then know that this is the network identifier and this is the computer identifier so there's a subnet mask scheme 10.1.10.5 let's say it has a subnet mask of dot 255.0.0.0 right so if you put these together one plus two let's see one plus two plus four plus eight plus 16 plus 32 plus 64 plus 128 that will get you two five five and so then we know that in this the network identifier is 10 because the subnet mask is only is 255. when we look at this this up here is a class c subnet 255.25 [Music] so what that means is this is one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight one two oh no no over there and so basically so this is uh you know all filled up so that's 255. this is all filled up so that's 255. and this is all filled up so that's 255. and so we can see here using these octets this is the network identifier and this is the computer identifier and that's where these subnets come from and so basically that's the thing is when you're looking at numbers whether it's 192 whether it's 255 basically you're going through and you're just you know you keep going until until there's a break and how and how many uh in the ones and that's when you know when the network identifiers one side and the computer identifier is on the other so why this works out is because when you're sitting there and you're trying to figure out how to divide uh up your computers that you there's a limited number of computer identifiers and there's a limited number of network identifiers right so basically when we're sitting here and if we have a class c subnet 255.255.255 we only have the final octet to be able to use to be able to get the ip address for computers in this particular network and with that you get a maximum of 254 uh different uh ip addresses that you can have on this particular network as you're able to get more octets into the computer side you're able to get more computers onto your network but the number of networks goes down so in a class c right a class c subnet 255.255.255.0 this allows you to have 254 uh computer ip addresses and a metric crap ton of network addresses again if you need to have a a huge number of network addresses this gives you that ability a class a subnet on the other hand 255.255.0.0 this then gives you only 254 possibly network addresses i think it's 254 something like that 256 maybe but then it gives you a metric crap ton of ip addresses that you can use on that particular network so when you're designing your network one of the questions is going to be is how many ip addresses do i want on my local area network that's basically computers that'll all be able to communicate with each other and how many different networks am i going to need to be able to break everything out so when you're looking at this this is this this is all it is when we talk about the subnet masks so now you're looking at those octet numbers and you're probably getting a little confused right because when we have the octet so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 right and this is 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128. one of the things i just said in the previous section is that uh if you have a class c subnet so 255.255.255.0 that in a class c subnet you're only going to have 254 ip addresses that you can use for the devices uh on your network again your servers your print servers whatever else and you're probably sitting there and you're like well wait a minute but if we add all of these together we get two five five so why am i only able to get to two five four and the reason for that is the uppermost number and the lowermost number in an ip address range are actually used for specific things so uh with the 254 to 200 to get to the 254 addresses here the lowest number in that particular network would be zero that is the network identifier so when you go and i talk about the um so we say 255.255.255 0 is actually the network identifier so we cannot use that as an ip address number if we add all of these up and we get to two five five we can't use two five five because two five five is the broadcast address so if you have all these computers that are connected to a switch and one computer needs to try to communicate with every other computer and the ip the ip address range it can use the uppermost number that 255 address to do a broadcast and actually broadcast out to all of the other computers within that subnet range to try to communicate with them for for any particular purpose so the lowest number uh is zero that is the the network identifier and the highest number two five that is the broadcast address so when you look at this theoretically you can have 256 addresses one would be zero one would be 255. so this is where they say talk about 256 minus two whenever you're trying to figure out how many usable ip addresses you have in range you count out up the numbers then you do minus 2 because the lowest number is the the network number and the highest number is the broadcast address number so now as we've been talking about ip addresses and subnet masks i've been talking about subnet classes you will hear me talk about class a class b class c there's also actually class d and class e but we're generally not going to worry about these this is not a ccna class you want to do a class d's and e's go to your ccna class essentially when we talk about the class of ip address this is just a simple way to explain more or less how many 255's we're dealing with right so when you have a class a subnet basically that means is 255.0.0.0. so if i say this is a 10.1.10.15 address on a class a subnet i then know the 10 is the network identifier and everything past that is going to be the computer identifier uh we have class b subnet that is 255.255. [Music] so the first two octets those are used as the network identifier the last two are used for the computer identifier and the the subnet mask you're generally going to be using a lot is a class c and that's 255.255.255.0 and basically for this what this means is the first three octets are the network identifier and the final octet is the computer identifier that will give us up to 254 individual ip addresses for at whatever network that we're dealing with and so you're probably sitting here like well that's that's not too bad right this is this all this all seems pretty easy but here's an interesting question right one of the important things to be thinking about as a technology professional is to remember you're going to be interacting with systems you're going to be active interacting with other administrators and many times essentially what other administrators are going to do is they're responsible for the whole network and then they're going to give you like a little chunk of the network for you to play with right so let's say um you know you're working for for a large enterprise type company and the main network operations folks they say okay we're going to give you an ip address block and we're going to give you 192.168.1 dot subnet right so that's a 255.255.255.0 subnet mask and you can do with it as you will so uh that gives us 254 uh potential ip addresses within that particular sub uh subnet block um and so you're given these ip addresses and the subnet mask to build out your infrastructure but then you're sitting there and you're thinking about it you're like well let's see i have this one land so i have a lan and on this land i have my active directory server my dhcp server and my users right that's the important thing my users are on this one lan and let's say i've got 100 users plus 10 servers that are on this particular lam but but we also have this database application thing right so we have a cluster of database servers and we'll talk about clusters in a different class but essentially we have a cluster of database servers and you know what i really want to do i want to put them on their own individual lan and i don't want users to be able to willy-nilly be able to see the cluster right when we take a look at things like ransomware attacks and other things the reason things like ransomware attacks are able to occur is because users computers are able to see things such as the database cluster if a user's computer can see something it can attack something and then everything goes to hell so as a high level administrator one of the things that i want to think about is how to segregate my networks how to separate my networks so that different devices and computers can only talk to and can only communicate with the computers and devices that they should be communicating with and this is where we use routers and we use firewalls and there's a whole bunch of stuff we're going to talk about in a different class and so you know what i said about what i think about here is like you know if if i could connect these two local area networks with a router most likely also with a firewall there and then only the appropriate traffic could go back and forth that would be a wonderful thing but what does a router do what does router require a router requires two different networks this has to be an at one network identifier and this has to be a different network identifier but at this point i've only been given one network identifier have 192.168.1.x network and so how am i going to make this work out how you make this work out is by thinking about your subnet mask slightly differently right so we look at these octets oh one two three four five six seven eight period one two three four five six seven eight period one two three four five six seven a period one two three four five six seven eight right so these are the four octets that we're used to one two four eight sixteen uh 32 32 64 128 is the name the scheme so whenever you're dealing with cisco equipment whenever you're dealing with something that's very network heavy one of the things that you'll see how they denote uh subnet masks instead of saying class a class b class c they'll do a slash so so oops so they'll do 192.168.1.10 on a slash 24. and so what this means is we use the first 24 bits as the subnet mask and then the final eight that's what's actually used for the computer identifier right so currently we have 192.168.1 dot x and we got slash 24 and so this is the network identifier and this is the computer identifier but i have been given this to play with as as i want so what i can do is i can additionally essentially add to the subnet mask to be able to divide my networks into two different networks so i can add an additional network identifier so since i've been given 24 what i can say is you know what i want to do i want to steal one i want to steal one bit out of this class c subnet and i want to use that as a network identifier so that i can create my two networks and that way i have networks that that can that the routers can deal with and so what happens there is then you do 192.168.1 let's say 10 as the ip address slash 25. and so when you say the slash 25 that means you're bringing in that additional bit and so this will be part of the network identifier and then the other part that will be the computer identifier when you do this we then actually come up with two networks so then we have a dot zero network and we have a dot 128 network so with this essentially get an ip address range of dot one through dot 126 for the first network and you get an ip address range of 129 uh through uh 254 for the second network so the 1.126 so if i have if i have an ip address of 192.168. oh 1.5 slash 25 then this can see 192.168 [Music] slash 25. you can see 192.168.1. oh was it 126.25 so all of these would be in the same subnet uh 192.168.1.200.25 would be in a different subnet and that is where you would need the routers to be communicating uh between the two and so that's how you can be given a subnet range for yourself at an institution and then essentially basically grab grab the additional octet bits here to decide how many networks that you that you need do you need two networks so uh a slash 25 will give you two additional networks a slash 26 will give you four additional networks a slash 27 will give you eight additional networks and go from there now when you're doing this you can go through and you can figure out all the numbers you can figure out all the numbering you can figure out all the networks or or and i'm going to tell you this i want to tell you this because i remember when i was in your shoes you can also use a cheat sheet you know use a cheat sheet when i'm looking off to the side i'm looking off to the side i'm actually using a cheat sheet here uh so this is just a little subnet mask cheat sheet that i found um and this kind of shows you the different things to that that you can be thinking about uh when you when you're doing the the subnet mask and right so basically this shows us here on a slash 30 this is only going to give us four addresses for two hosts because remember the lowest address is used for the network number the highest address is used for the broadcast number so since you get four addresses you can actually only use two hosts this gives you the net mask here and it goes through if you go down here we can see the different uh things so if it slash 25 it gives you the network numbers that you can use it gives you the ip address ranges that you can use and it gives you the broadcast address a slash 26 it tells you it will give you four additional subnets you know.0.64.128.192 this will give you ip address ranges that are useful there and you so on and so forth but this is basically the basics of how the subnet mask system system works essentially think of it is where the ones end one one one one one one where that ends that is where the subnet mask ends that is the identifier for the network everything past that is the computer identifier that you're gonna be dealing with so now that one of the questions that's probably coming up in your mind is you keep hearing me say hearing me say it talk about like 192.168.1.x or 10 you know x dot x dot x and one of the questions is is where am i getting these ip address ranges from so when you go to create an ip address range uh within your network where do these numbers come from by just kind of pulling them out of my butt and the reality is no i'm being told what these numbers are i'm being told what these numbers are right so if you're out and you're on the the full-fledged internet right you have a data center that is connected directly to the internet somebody there is going to be telling you what your ip address range is essentially where you buy that network connectivity they're going to tell you what your ip address is they're going to tell you what your subnet mask is the whole nine yards now for you as an individual that may be in a home a small office a medium-sized office that type of thing in that type of place you're going to be using non-internet routable addresses essentially private ip addresses that int that internet networking equipment know not to route because one of the problems you can run into right when you're dealing with the cloud if you if you do something stupid and you set up some stupid ip address range in your your network and then that gets advertised to all of the other networking devices on the cloud you can run into a real problem where all of a sudden traffic will start getting routed to your computers or devices even though that's definitely not what you want right you want to be able to have one printer on your network be able to print to the print server on your network you don't want all the traffic for travelocity to be sent to your print server that type of thing and so basically what's what they've created is what are called private ip addresses these are ip addresses where any internet connected networking equipment will simply not allow the traffic to continue the ip address will not be broadcast it will not be made available to the wider internet and so this gives you some room to play with so you can come up with your own you know ip address schemes and you don't have to worry about screwing up the rest of the internet uh this again as with a lot of stuff this gets a little bit complicated you know you have to understand things i haven't taught you before this fully makes sense uh but like one of the problems you can get to there's something called bgp border gateway protocol this is something called a routing protocol and this is the routing protocol that data centers telcos those types of folks will use in order to route traffic through the internet one of the one of the mistakes that's happened in the past couple of years is for for some reason for some reason nobody understands why there will be periods of time when all like u.s internet traffic or almost all european internet traffic gets routed to china yeah that's surprising how that works all of a sudden there will be a misconfiguration with bgp on some of the routers in in china they will advertise routes that they're not supposed to advertise and all of a sudden you know a whole bunch of traffic you know from maryland to the united states or from from from estonia and europe all the sudden starts getting routed through china and the reason for that is is when you're actually connected to the real internet the real internet is simply a whole bunch of networking devices connected they're much more powerful they are much more expensive but they work on a lot of the same principles as the networking equipment that's in your house or whatever work on so if somebody makes all a mis-configuration sudden oops everybody's traffic is somehow going to china for some reason i'm not i'm not getting in the middle of this politically i'm just saying it happens a shocking amount of the time right and so here's the thing so even if high networking administrators screw up things like border gateway protocol and send all the traffic to china just imagine if every you know new net plus you know person who got certified in net plus what if their configurations on their local network would screw with the internet that would definitely be a bad thing and so that's why they came up with these private ip address ranges and then so this allows you to create ip address ranges within your own local library network within your own enterprise but the rest of the internet knows that if somehow it shouldn't escape the the these ip addresses shouldn't escape out onto the internet but if somehow they do um all the networking equipment on the larger internet will simply ignore those ip addresses and so that's where if you look at the top here we have 10. oops yeah so 10.0.0.0.8 so that's a a class a subnet and so that allows you to have addresses 10.0.0.0 through 10.255.255.255. that basically gives you something like 16 million possible ip addresses and so you could you could create a very large network doing that they have 172.16.0.0 that's a slash 12 subnet so that will give you a lot of different ip addresses that you can use or what you'll see me use most of the time here is the 192 12168 and i'll do.1 but 0.0.16 so basically any ip addresses within this particular range they will simply get ignored uh when it goes out to the wider internet now you'll notice again whenever i've been using the 192.168 subnets i've been using a slash 24 not a slash 16 because that's how when i divide up networks within my infrastructure i prefer prefer to use that third octet as the network number instead of trying to go and screw around with the with the fourth octet what that means right is so they give me the ability to use so they do 192.168.1.0.0.16. so they allow me to use the last two octets for for computer ids and the first two octets that's that's just sectioned off for the network id that is basically hard coded so what i can do is instead of using a slash 16 i can use a slash 24. when i do a slash 24 it goes 192.168.1.x this now gives me the ability to create my networks out of that third octet and then use the fourth octet for the computer identifier again for that fourth octet uh if you only have one octet you can have a maximum of 254 ip addresses 254 ip addresses is more than anything that i ever need to deal with and so when i am using multiple networks within my system basically i need a different networks for the routing that means i can use that third octet to create my different networks how i have used this in the past is something called dmz's something called demilitarized zone this isn't as important as it used to be but it can still be very valuable right so let's say you have the internet here and this comes in and this connects to your isp modem right your isp modem and then what happens if you only have if you only have one internet connection but you need to create multiple different networks to use this single network connection so what might happen here is so i have this router here and this connects you know to a network with different computers and devices and then i want to put another router and then under that will be a switch that will connect to different computers and devices and under that i might you know have another network that will connect why i might use this especially if an internet connection is kind of expensive in my area is what if i want a guest wireless network so i want the guests at my facility to be able to use a wireless network but i do not want them to be able to see my servers i do not want them to be able to see my the the normal user computers so what can happen here is i can create a 192.168.1.x network so this is 255.255 right so this is the network id for this particular network the first network that i'm creating i then connect another router to this and what i'll do here is i'll make this the 192.168.2.x network so again it's a 255.255.255.0 and so this is the network id so 192.168.1.x is this network 192.168.2.x is this network and then let's say let's say i put servers there so let's say i have like my web server i have some other kind of servers there i would put there so maybe that maybe they're a little bit more vulnerable theoretically they could be hacked so i i want to i want them to be able to connect to the internet but if they get hacked for some reason i want to keep them separated from my internal network so my internal network has my active directory going on this is a security protocol type thing it has my file servers as all my users it has my printers the whole nine yards so for this network then i might create 192.168.3.x again with the 255.255.255. so now this is the 192.168.3 network and that's this particular network again routers route between networks so therefore if 192.168.1.3 if the computers on this network need to get to the internet this router will route up to this router will route up the teeth here out to the internet they'll be able to get their internet traffic all that kind of stuff and it will get routed down below and so that's how you can use these different uh subnet masks and such in order to create again a different architecture for the infrastructure that you're designing for oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my golly oh my god is it over is this class over please tell me it's over please tell me it's over you know the only thing worse than taking a class on subnet masking yeah trying to teach something i'm asking i don't know it just kind of cooks cooks your brain in a way because there's all this there's all this different crap that you have to get in your head and half the stuff that i have to teach you is most likely gonna be worthless in your career and half the stuff is gonna be incredibly valuable but which half is worthless and what half is valuable it's very difficult to know you know which is which and then on top of that you know you got to talk about things like architectures it's like hey yeah the reason this is important is because of all this stuff that you haven't been taught yet but to understand that you kind of sort of got to understand this and and they just i don't know it just melts your brain it just melts your brain what i'll tell you what i will tell you is if you do if you do not have to take a test let me be clear if you do not have to take a test use cheat sheets cheat sheets are fine honestly what i'm going to tell you in the real world what you're going to find is there is going to be a way that you decide to do subnet masking and then that's just the way that you're going to use and it's going to work perfectly fine and and you're just going to keep using that forever again like i say whenever i build a network it's 192.168.1.x if i have to have multiple networks within the same infrastructure is.2.x.3.x.4.x.5.x.6.x that's how i build this stuff it's i just find it to be very easy those that's the private address range that i've been given i generally don't deal with networks i have over the 254 uh you know requirement for 254 ip addresses and so that's the way i go about things you when you go out if you're a consultant or you're building your own network maybe you're going to like the 10.x.x.x network right i need i need 16 million ip addresses eli if i don't have the ability to have 16 million ip addresses within my network on a single lan right anyways that's what you might do i have consultant friends of mine whenever they build out networks it's always the ten dot whatever network that's how it is most likely you're going to go into your infrastructure and you're gonna be told what it is this is what it is and again remember it's the technology world it's either right or it's wrong so if they tell you to do it some way just do it that way because you're not going to be reinventing the wheel and so again that's one of the difficult things with this kind of thing too is one of these how to it's an incr it's both incredibly practical and incredibly esoteric at the same time like when you need to know this you freaking need to know it you just can't really don't need to know it right so anyways the big important thing here is again to remember essentially when we talk about an ip address an ip address contains both the network identifier and the device identifier the subnet mask shows you where that ends and basically you use the octets the four octets and wherever the ones end that's where the network identifier ends and the device identifier begins if you add up if you add up all the the the numbers in an octet that gets you to 255. so just realize if you have 255.255.255 that means the first three octets of the ip address are the network identifier and the last octet of the ip address is the actual computer identifier there if it's 255.0.0.0 that means the first octet is used as a network identifier the rest of the octets are used as the computer identifier and you go from there again you can you can subdivide so if you are given a class c subnet a slash 24 subnet and for some reason you need multiple networks out of that that's where you can go to a slash 25 you can go to a slash 26 and then you can subdivide that way in order to create your your router scheme and your architecture and go from there the important thing to remember that the thing that really screws new people up is sometimes they forget what the hell networking equipment does and the important thing to understand is routers routers route between different networks if you have 192.168.1.x on one side and you have 192.168.1.x on the other side nothing is going to the communication is not going to work properly because you have as far as the router is concerned you have two networks on the each side of the router so there's nothing to actually route there again one of the other things to be thinking about this is 50 year old technology at this point so theoretically you could have a single switch on that single switch you could have two ip address screen ip address schemes so you could have 1i2.168.1.x for some of your computers and you got 192.168.2.x 24 with some of your other computers although they're on the same switch and although they're within the same collision domain from an ethernet standpoint as far as tcpip is concerned they're not going to be able to communicate with each other and so that gets in to its own world would you do that in the real world in the 2020s probably not but again it's an important thing to understand how all this different technology is layered on each other and how you could run into problems again when i talk about that that's not vlans there's something called a virtual lan a virtual lan is a way to logically divide your switch actually at that layer 2 level this is not that this is up there at the network level the layer 3 level um yeah and then finally like i say the the private ip addresses the 192.168 or the 10 whatever those are those are the standard private ip addresses that you can use that that's what you're going to be using and whether it's the enterprise or whether in your home that's generally what you're going to be using there is the other ip address game i didn't talk a lot about was 172.16. this was actually opened up as a private address to scheme in 2012. be careful of using 172.16 though as an address scheme because apparently not all networking equipment knows that it's supposed to be routed at this point one of the problems you run into in the real technology world is standards can change but if you don't upgrade the firmware and for your equipment or if you can't upgrade the firmware of the equipment even if the technical standards changed the equipment is still going to be doing what it did and so with the 172.16 range a lot of networking equipment actually will not deal with that range appropriately simply because you may have a networking equipment that you installed back in 2005 that's doing fine if you never upgrade it if you never fix the the firmware or anything like that you put 172 under your network and it may it may not know what to do with that particular private address range so i would tell you stay with either the 10.0.0.0 range or the 192.168.0.0 range uh that will be better for you and it was very confusing keep following along and maybe sometime in the future maybe a month from now come back uh to watch this particular class um yeah and again it's just one of those it's just one of those things don't worry about it again again i deal with ip addresses every day i deal with ip addresses every day and i i swear to you like this whole subnet mask i have my little cheat sheet up on my computer over here because even though i deal with it every day it's like there's dealing with it and then there's dealing with it anyways i think you get what i'm saying so anyways uh as always i enjoy teaching this particular class well no i didn't that's a lie that's a lie proof that even eli the computer guy lies to every once in a while it sucked tiki in this class i never want to teach this class again this is the last time i'm ever going to teach subnet masking i'm done i'm done i don't care this sucks but anyways anyways normally i enjoy teaching these classes and i definitely i want to come back and we're going to do another class that i enjoy teaching not subnet masks anyways see y'all later
