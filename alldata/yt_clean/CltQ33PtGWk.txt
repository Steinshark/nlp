- [Rhett] Will these new gadgets and gizmos - [Rhett] have us reaching for our wallets or the trash? - [Link] Let's talk about that ((Intro Music)) - [Link] Good Mythical Morning. - [Rhett] Between Amazon, TikTok and Instagram. - [Rhett] There is a never ending lineup of products that are being shoved in our faces, - [Rhett] all claiming to make our lives easier. - [Link] But as we've learned, these new fangled products aren't always - [Link] as useful as they seem. And I refuse to flush my hard earned money - [Link] down the toilet, it's terrible for the plumbing. - [Link] So today we're doing your toilet a favor - [Link] by finding out which new tools are in fact worth it. - [Rhett] You're welcome. It's time for New Tool or Old School. - [Link] First up, we have a sunflower seed peeling machine that looks like a pig. - [Link] Does it vomit out the seeds? - [Rhett] Well, you might think it was a piggy bank for coins - [Rhett] that we don't have in this country because they wouldn't fit in that. - [Rhett] But this thing has a motor inside and a sensor, - [Rhett] and you just find a sunflower seed and you put it into the hole. - [Link] Don't be nervous. - [Rhett] That is the smallest hole that it'll still fit in. - [Rhett] Okay, so that means that it's too big. So this one. - [Rhett] Oh, see? When it gets the right size. Look. Look at that. - [Rhett] It completely did. It. That's the seed, just for you, Link. - [Link] And that's a beautiful seed. Look at that. - [Rhett] I want to do it again. - [Link] Hey, man, contain yourself. - [Rhett] I mean, how often do we get some little crappy thing from the Internet on this show, - [Rhett] and it actually works as advertised? I mean, this is mind blowing. - [Link] If it's too small then - [Rhett] Now it says it has the ability to distinguish between good and bad seeds. - [Link] I think it, what? - [Rhett] No, I don't believe that. It also says it's the best gift for - [Rhett] yourself, lover, family, friends, pets. ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] I'm going to gift this to my lover. - [Rhett] Hey, baby, watch this. I'm going to put my seed in this. ((Confused Murmurs)) - [Rhett] I didn't mean, that came out wrong. - [Link] It's still a one at a time kind of thing. I thought maybe there'd be like - [Link] some sort of a bin and then it would do the sorting for you. - [Rhett] All right, let's see what you can do on your own. - [Link] Well, that's what we're going to do, a competition between man, - [Link] I'm going to stand in for man today, and machine. - [Link] But first of all, what is this button? Power? - [Rhett] I don't know. - [Link] It's got a little USB butthole. Does it open? - [Rhett] Let's not break it because it's working right now, - [Rhett] and I'm amazed by that and I don't want you to "Link" it. - [Link] Okay. True. - [Rhett] Yeah. So it doesn't have to be turned on, I don't think. - [Rhett] It's just, when it's charged the sensors on and maybe, I don't know. I don't know. - [Stevie] Okay. You ready to compete to see who has the most seeds? - [Link] Well, the only way that I know to crack a sunflower seed is in my mouth. - [Stevie] Do you need to practice? - [Rhett] I'm not going to eat it. - [Link] while on a road trip. - [Rhett] I'm not going to do that if you eat it. - [Link] But there's no other - [Link] You're not going to? - [Rhett] I'm not going to eat your sunflower seeds that have been in your mouth. - [Link] But what did you say though? - [Rhett] I said I'm not going to do it if you eat it. I'm not going to eat it if you do it. - [Rhett] I don't know what I said. I want you to treat me like I'm your son on a road trip, - [Rhett] and I actually want to eat the sunflower seeds, - [Rhett] and if daddy puts them in his mouth, - [Rhett] this isn't like you and your grandma. - [Rhett] And the weird stuff y'all had going on growing up. - [Rhett] This is like normal families - [Rhett] where you don't eat things out of your relatives mouths. Okay? - [Link] I know how to blow a bubble with some gum and you don't. - [Link] Thank you, Nana, for sticking your tongue in my gum. - [Stevie] You're cracking seeds for each other. You're cracking seeds not for yourself. - [Rhett] He's already started. - [Link] I mean, I guess this is - [Rhett] Only thing I need is more hands. - [Link] I mean, it's so much better, this way. - [Stevie] Well, I don't understand the situation you'd be in, - [Stevie] in which you would cracking sunflower seeds - [Stevie] for someone else. I guess a child? - [Link] A child, on a road trip, Stevie. - [Stevie] Okay. - [Link] So much better. But you do have to spit out the majority. - [Rhett] I'm not spitting out anything over here. - [Rhett] Most sunflower seeds that we have around here are small - [Rhett] because I'm going into the two little slots - [Rhett] the whole time I haven't been in one of the big slots yet at all. - [Link] You know what I just realized? - [Link] These are the things that are in the middle of a sunflower seed, right? - [Link] Like a big black part of a sunflower. Yeah, the flower. - [Link] If that's the seeds, right? The big black part in the middle. - [Link] What in the world? And what do you do? - [Link] Just rake your hand over it and all of these fall off? - [Link] And are they pointing out? I know they're huge and kind of scary, - [Link] but I've never been in a sunflower field. - [Link] Is that something you can buy a ticket to? - [Rhett] I had a sunflower grow in my backyard one time. - [Link] How big did it get? - [Rhett] I mean, feet. Many feet. - [Stevie] Haven't you seen those TikToks where they take the whole big sunflower head - [Stevie] and then they put it on the grill? They put some oil on it, and put it on the grill, - [Stevie] and they just, like, shove the entire thing in their mouth. - [Rhett] Really? - [Stevie] I mean, you know, as much of it can fit. - [Link] To answer your question. No, I haven't. - [Rhett] I mean, this is phenomenal. Look what I've done for you. - [Link] Well, now you have to sort through it. - [Rhett] Oh, okay. - [Rhett] So I'm still going. - [Rhett] I've done so many. Now If it sorted for it automatically. It would be better. - [Rhett] It would be better, but this is something. - [Rhett] You give this pile to your kid on the road trip - [Rhett] and then they have to do the sorting and, you know, learn a little bit of a lesson. - [Rhett] You can't have everything done for you, Timmy - [Link] I will say, sunflower seeds also good for fishing - [Link] and then maybe for baseball, also maybe for watching baseball. - [Link] But those are the only scenarios I can come up with. - [Link] I just busted that one, where you would want sunflower seeds at all. - [Rhett] I feel like I'm still the one distinguishing between the good and the bad. - [Link] Maybe on a salad. - [Rhett] I don't think the pig did any of that. - [Link] Aren't they on, like, buffets. - [Rhett] Yeah. Some of my favorite buffets have sunflower seeds. ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] Okay, so, I have, in that amount of time, I did 4, 8. - [Rhett] 12, 15. I got 21 seeds. - [Link] I have 12 but two of them were in my mouth at some point. - [Rhett] Yeah. I don't want to eat those. - [Link] So you clearly won the race. - [Rhett] Yeah. - [Link] So are we saying new tool? - [Rhett] New tool. ((Upbeat Music)) - [Link] Did you know that over ten years ago - [Link] we were still doing this show? I don't know why I said still. - [Link] We were still doing it, 10 years in the past. - [Rhett] We're still doing it. - [Link] And this next product we talked about, - [Link] but we didn't have the budget then to have it. This is what we looked like back then. - [Rhett] Yeah, we were just in my garage. - [Link] Other than that haven't changed a bit. - [Link] So we talked about the Ostrich Pillow, but we didn't have it - [Link] and now we've got it. It's cool to the touch. - [Rhett] It's cool to the look. - [Link] Is it cool to the look? - [Rhett] It kind of looks like it could be like a vest for a child. - [Link] Is this like the pee pee hole? - [Rhett] No, no. This would be like if the doctor needs to - [Rhett] take the stethoscope right there and still listen to the child's heart. - [Link] We also used this thing on the Tour of Mythicality. Like our first tour, - [Link] when we brought people on stage, we'd put it on their head, so that, - [Link] it was basically like a comedic blindfold. - [Rhett] So they couldn't see something that was going on. - [Rhett] And we used the same one the entire tour, - [Rhett] but we washed it between every tour. - [Rhett] And by wash it, I mean we just let it sit on the bus - [Rhett] for a couple of days and the bacteria died - [Link] We aired it out. But this is what you're supposed to do with it. - [Link] You're supposed to, like, take a nap on your desk. Do you want to go first? - [Rhett] I would like for you to go first. - [Rhett] I do want to point out, as you're putting this on, Link, - [Rhett] that, if you look at the advertisement for this thing - [Rhett] and one of the original pictures, - [Rhett] I believe if you would cover your eyes up - [Rhett] and do just like this guy does, showing your mouth and your nose. - [Link] Like that? - [Rhett] You are the model for the original picture. - [Link] Do I have the same mouth and nose? - [Rhett] No chin. You show just the bottom of the mouth. - [Link] Is that me? Am I the Ostrich Pillow nose and mouth guy? - [Rhett] You look, I mean, he has the exact same. - [Rhett] Are you sure you weren't taken? Do you remember being kidnaped - [Rhett] about ten years ago and being driven somewhere - [Rhett] and then having something put over your head - [Rhett] and then, like, feeling like a flash bulb? - [Link] I'm a heavy sleeper, and I take long naps. - [Link] I might have given somebody a free talent. - [Rhett] I've got this, like a traditional. This is only $14. - [Link] I mean, and then these are just for cuddling your hands. - [Rhett] And also for being able to hear. - [Link] I can hear. I can hear just as well as I could a second ago. - [Rhett] I don't like these travel pillows. - [Rhett] They don't work for me. Something about the way, I'm shaped. - [Link] The problem with leaning over like this is that - [Link] it does something to let air into my stomach - [Link] and then I'll like wake up like with these big burps. I don't like that. - [Link] I think the problem with this thing - [Link] This is not a good way to nap - [Rhett] what you look like in the plane. - [Link] Oh, we're on a plane. I'm on a plane now. - [Rhett] You know? No one's wearing this thing because if they were, - [Rhett] there would be so many TikToks of like, - [Rhett] the guy next to me on the plane is wearing this thing. - [Rhett] He's also sleeping on me right now. - [Link] Is this accurate? - [Rhett] You usually don't lean on me. I usually push you back to the other person, - [Rhett] like that. Now, here's a real test. - [Link] It gets warm in here quick, man. - [Rhett] Let's say if things got turbulent, and I needed to use a barf bag. - [Rhett] I would have no trouble. I would have no trouble. Just ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] I would have no trouble barfing, but what would you do? - [Link] I'd barf, you know? This is the barf hole. - [Link] This is where the barf comes from. - [Rhett] Looks like we're going to get barf on the sides of it. - [Link] You know, then you just air it out. - [Rhett] Can you get the bag to seal completely around it? If you go inside. - [Rhett] Like this, so that the bag is completely sealed on every side, - [Rhett] so that the only thing barf hits is bag. - [Rhett] So basically it's just completely - [Rhett] Completely sealed. Okay. You probably need to get on the plane like that. ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] You just walk - [Link] Walk around doinking into stuff? Ow. - [Rhett] Yeah, yeah, I'll be with you. - [Rhett] All right - [Rhett] 27 C, you're there, Link, sit down. - [Rhett] Well, what if we, I kind of feel like we can complete the look. - [Rhett] Take your hand out. - [Rhett] You can barf out of any hole. - [Link] This is just a $100 gimmick, man. - [Rhett] This is how he's going to walk on the plane. - [Rhett] No, I'm not with this man. No, no, I'm not with this man. - [Rhett] I'm just directing him to his seat. - [Link] I'm a little too hot in the head area right now. - [Rhett] You look like something that would be in, like, a B-movie, - [Rhett] Guillermo del Toro rip off. Something you'd run into in a maze somewhere. - [Link] I like wearing a mask on a plane. - [Rhett] I like the way the bag moves when you talk. Keep talking. - [Link] I don't have anything else to say. - [Rhett] Move your mouth more. - [Rhett] What else do I say? I don't know what to do. - [Link] I can't think, when I can't see. - [Rhett] Okay, Link, I didn't try it on and I don't want to. - [Link] $100. - [Rhett] $100, 4.1 stars out of 5 on Amazon. - [Rhett] I don't think people are really loving this thing. I mean, it looks great, - [Rhett] but how do you feel? - [Link] I feel too hot. I feel stupid. But I do like it when people are looking at me - [Link] and I feel like that would be accomplished, but it's not enough. - [Link] I'm saying old school for this one. - [Rhett] All right. We're going to go with this. Even though, I don't even like this one, - [Rhett] I just dislike it less than what you're wearing. ((Upbeat Music)) - [Rhett] Tomorrow I am turning another year older - [Rhett] and the way I am alleviating the sting of being 46. - [Rhett] Is by giving you stuff. That's right. - [Rhett] You can get up to 20% off some of my favorite items - [Rhett] over at the Mythical store through the 13th. - [Rhett] Okay, so go over there to Mythical.com and also we got some discounts - [Rhett] on the Mythical Society. 10% of all first degree plans, - [Rhett] 20% of all second and third degree plans. - [Rhett] And that goes through the 18th. Celebrating birthday week, all week! - [Link] With all those deals that you're just hammering us with, - [Link] I forgot how old you were getting. - [Rhett] 46. - [Rhett] Can you tell what I said when I said 46? - [Link] I am going to give you this next thing as a birthday present tomorrow. - [Link] If we choose new tool and I'm actually pretty excited about this. - [Link] I did not know that you could create a hard boiled golden egg. - [Link] By scrambling the innards of an egg, and keeping the shell intact. - [Rhett] And I don't know exactly why you'd want to do this. - [Rhett] I guess if you're grossed out by the idea of that, just like, - [Link] I don't like the yolk part of a hard boiled egg, - [Link] so this fantastic $15 on Amazon device might be exactly what I need. - [Rhett] Like an egg rocket. - [Link] Well, it's almost like a deep sea diver type thing. - [Rhett] And I'm going to do the old school method, - [Rhett] which is actually new school to me. - [Rhett] But there's a YouTube video that we watched by some, what is the guy's name? - [Rhett] Hawking? Night Hawk In Light. - [Link] Night Hawk In Light. - [Rhett] I don't know if he came up with it, but he made a video about it - [Rhett] that explains how you can take, - [Rhett] it's going to take me a second, because I have to tie this thing in. - [Link] I'll show you how to do this, because I also need to prep this. - [Link] You turn that, you take that apart. You take this little submersible, - [Link] you open up the hatch and look at that. It is begging for an egg. - [Link] This part right here is a rubber, always use protection. - [Link] And I guess any egg? Nope. Only eggs that fit are the size that - [Rhett] Does your egg fit? Or did you get a big egg? - [Link] Do I just smoosh it? I mean, I think I just smoosh it. - [Rhett] No, you don't. - [Link] Right? Or do I take this out? Is this for, like, are you making this up? - [Rhett] This one's smaller. This egg's smaller. - [Link] Okay. That one's smaller. And then I take this - [Link] and I keep that in there because it's like the cushion, - [Link] because I'm going to spin the crap out of this thing. - [Link] I'm so relieved. - [Link] What's that white stuff? Is that egg? - [Rhett] No, that's decoration. - [Link] Okay, then I'll put it back on here. Are you ready? - [Rhett] I'm so ready. - [Link] And then I put this back on there. - [Rhett] I've got my egg in a sock and I'm so ready. - [Link] And then all I got to do is yank on this. - [Rhett] That's not a euphemism for anything. - [Link] You put it in there? - [Rhett] You ready to go, son? Yes, I got my egg in a sock. - [Link] Yep, and you're going to yank on it? No, I'm going to yank on it. - [Rhett] I'm going to spin it. - [Link] You're going to spin it. Spin it and pull it. - [Rhett] So what I do, according to Nighting Hawk Light. - [Rhett] Light, light, night, hawk, light, night, light and hawk? I don't know what it is. - [Rhett] I said it right the first time. It's going to be like this and pull. - [Link] Are you ready? Okay, then I'm just going to go. - [Link] Can you hear me? Maybe if I do this, I can tell you that this - [Rhett] Am I doing it right, Night Hawk? - [Link] I've had a lot of practice doing this back in my lawn mower days. - [Link] Can't get it started. Just how am I going to mow, - [Link] if I can't get my lawn mower started. - [Link] All the neighbors are watching. I'm so embarrassed. - [Link] I wish I had an Ostrich Pillow to put over my head, that would make this funnier. - [Link] I was asking for the Ostrich Pillow to go on my head. - [Link] But nobody's listening to me. - [Link] Thanks, guys, for nothing. - [Rhett] Okay. I don't know if I did it or not, Night Hawk, but - [Link] Oh, my gosh. Well, first of all, this is a workout. My heart rate's up. - [Rhett] Well, try to spin a sock. - [Link] And then all I got to do is take this off. - [Rhett] You break your egg, or is that your underarms? - [Link] Something stinks, I mean - [Rhett] It smells like baloney. - [Link] Okay, you know what? It's still intact. - [Link] And now I'm going to write on this thing. What am I going to write? - [Rhett] So, you can tell the difference between our eggs. Can I get some scissors? - [Link] I'm going to write new tool on this. Oh, see? They listen to you. - [Rhett] It's the way I say things, Link. - [Link] All right, so, we're going to boil this - [Rhett] I sound serious, - [Rhett] so now, Night Hawk, here you go. I've got a perfectly golden egg. - [Link] We cannot, well, we can't tell yet. We're going to boil it. - [Link] Then we're going to see what it tastes like. - [Link] How long did it take us to boil these eggs? - [Rhett] We boiled them. They were actively boiling for 10 minutes - [Rhett] and then they've been sitting for about 7. - [Link] It's about as long as it takes to film The More for this episode. - [Rhett] Yeah, don't tell anybody. - [Link] Okay, let's put these in. - [Rhett] Just in case you didn't know, you can mark up your eggs and boil them - [Rhett] and the Sharpie will stay on. - [Link] I'm glad, because now we still know that this is the new tool - [Rhett] Dropping them into some cold water. - [Link] I do not know what this is going to look like. - [Rhett] I don't believe that mine is going to be fully scrambled - [Link] And I don't know if it's going to, is this long enough? - [Rhett] Apologies to the Night Hawk. - [Link] All right, so - [Rhett] It will be user error, if it doesn't work. - [Link] What you want to do here? - [Rhett] You're going to probably, I mean, it's gonna be pretty hot. - [Link] What do you mean? - [Rhett] Are they cooled down? - [Link] No. Do we need to? - [Rhett] How about another time wipe. What do you want to do now? - [Link] Yeah, let's just do another time wipe. - [Rhett] Let's shoot another more - [Link] Women, can't live with them. - [Link] Oh, I got that wrong. Women, you can only live with them. - [Rhett] That's right. - [Link] The water is all hot now. I don't know. - [Rhett] I wouldn't call that hot. I would call that lukewarm. - [Rhett] And I think we're probably good to go at this point. - [Rhett] Now, I'm expecting yours to be better than mine, because you had the new tool. - [Link] Why don't you do? - [Link] I don't even know what to expect. The whole egg is going to be gold? - [Link] Do this one too. - [Link] Riveting content. Should we do another clock wipe, perhaps? I don't know. - [Rhett] I've never had an egg stick so hard to itself. - [Link] What about a clock wipe. - [Rhett] So, as you can see - [Link] Nothing. You failed, dude. - [Rhett] I didn't do it right. - [Link] All right. So, now I'm having so much struggle right now. - [Rhett] I think now that you've cooled it down, though, it'll peel more easily. - [Link] Okay. There you go. - [Rhett] You gonna make me do it? - [Link] Yeah, I've never done it. And I don't want to do it. - [Link] Come on, be gold. Be gold. Be gold. - [Link] Be, clock wipe. - [Stevie] I've never wanted to reach through the screen so badly. ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] what is wrong with me? - [Link] But you still don't want to get up and walk over here? - [Stevie] I will. - [Rhett] Okay. We over boiled it. Here's what we're going to do now. - [Link] Clock wipe. - [Link] Oh, gross. - [Rhett] See? Look. - [Rhett] It's actually green - [Link] What color is that? - [Rhett] It's green. - [Link] Oh, my God. - [Rhett] But it is completely homogenous, unlike my egg. - [Link] Oh, wow. Look, there's no, this is just - [Rhett] Don't over boil your eggs, kids. - [Link] This is the look of spherical defeat. I want to taste it though. - [Rhett] I'm going to get a clean, non shelled piece. - [Link] What? Better late than never. - [Rhett] it actually is not bad. It tastes like egg white and egg yolk together - [Rhett] but boiled. Boy, was that worth it. - [Link] I prefer just the egg white. I really do. - [Rhett] You don't like the yolk? - [Link] Yeah, I don't like the yolk, and you basically, instead of removing the part - [Link] I didn't like, now it has infiltrated the part that I did like - [Rhett] And it's not golden, it's little bit putrid green, which is not a great look. - [Link] So we are saying. - [Rhett] Hold on. - [Link] New to old school. - [Rhett] No, just because you don't like it doesn't mean that it's not a good tool. - [Link] I am saying, I trust women. - [Rhett] so we're saying, new tool. It does work, sorry Night Hawk. - [Link] It works yes, but I didn't prefer it. - [Rhett] Who would want to do it? But it does work. - [Rhett] Okay, so that means we actually tried two contraptions today, - [Rhett] that actually did work, and a third one that just makes you look stupid. - [Rhett] We're batting .666. - [Link] Something about this did feel cursed. - [Link] Thanks for subscribing and clicking the bell. - [Rhett] You know, what time it is. - [Rachel] This is Rachel. - [Lauren] And I'm Lauren. - [Rachel] And we just ate at Donut Prince in L.A. - [Lauren] Don't get a divorce, get a donut. - [Rachel] and it's time to spin the Wheel of Mythicality. - [Rhett] Words to live by. - [Link] Yep.
