Ohh, do you see that fish! That one is huge! On the BangerShad! Hey guys! Welcome back to the Headbanger channel. Where are we today Emanuel? New adventures. Today we're in Norway, at Frovag Havfiske. And we're going for some mix fishing. But especially for big halibut. This area is known for the really big halibut and that is what we're going for. We're in the south of Senja and we're really close to deep water. So that's why the fish gets so big in this area. You can see the camp behind us. We can show you some pictures inside, where we stay at this week of fishing. Right now! Now I think we need to go out, because there is a rain storm coming. Yeah, so we're going to make the most of it now. And then it's going to clear up later this afternoon and hopefully we get some good weather again. And with us today, we got the camp manager, Marre. What do you think about today? What I think about the day? Catch big fish! There! What a bite! There we go! On the BangerShad. That was a good bite! Look, he smacked that one! I didn't even feel a nibble. It was just straight on. BOOM! So nice! First one of the trip. This one is the perfect size to eat. So we're actually going to keep this one. And prepare some nice meals out of it. Now we're here. After quite some drive. Yeah, we left the rain storm behind us. It's stuck in the mountains. And we found some really great weather over here. Yeah! One halibut in the boat so far. And now we're going to try catch some more. And bigger? Even bigger..! So, let's go! Yes! There we go! There we go! Is it a halibut? Yes! Oh, now it's happening! Looks like it's a little bit bigger too. That's a big one. That's a big one! On a cusk! On the cusk! Now you get to show what you're up to! Ok, Emanuel! This is exciting! Here we go! First spot on a new area. The camp manager shows the way! It's not a small one at least... What is the depth here? 69 meters (226 ft) Oh no! It is cutting through the line. You just need to show it who's in charge! Get the head up and pull. There we go! No. I though it was coming there, but... This is a big fish. Yeah this is a big fish. I see when you're trying to lift it... Yeah, it is heavy. Yeah! This is a big one. This is a big one! It's like a military exercise. You need to motivate the other person. To keep the energy up. Good job, man! Now it's coming! Keep pushing! Keep pushing! Never let it turn. Reel, reel, reel, reel. We're soon out on 100 meters (328 ft) so you don't want it to turn around. No! I mean... I think this is really big. Unless it's faulty hooked or something. Oh! Push, push, push, push. No, no, no, no, no. He's going to go down to the bottom. Pull it in, pull it in! I'm trying! Lift the head. There we go. Good! Lift, lift, lift, lift. Good! Good! He didn't get too much. That's perfect. Short pull-in's saves the most power and are better. You don't want it to get down to the bottom now. It's 100 m (328 ft) here. We should be able to see color soon it feels like. Oh, I see it! I see color. Oh, man! Okay, this is a big one! This is a really big one if it looks that big already. Oh, this is a huge one! Keep reeling, keep reeling. Okay, don't let ut turn around. Oh, do you see that fish! That one is huge! That's a monster! Okay! Keep reeling. Keep reeling. Reel down the slack line now. Reel! But now it's going to get bad. Here we go, man! Yes! Secured! That's a big one! That's a 2 meter flounder! It's a 2 meter halibut! That's huge! Look at that fish! Even I am shaking. Look at that head! Tail rope, right? Yes! Try to set the tail as far down as possible. So the halibut lays as straight as possible. Now we're getting there. There it is! We have Emanuel like a living measuring board. I'm 1,97 m (6.5 ft). You can stretch it. I'm holding it down. I'm holding my arm almost straight. It's crazy! This is a huge fish! What are you feeling? Pain. Happiness. Excitement. We fished on a plateau. I think it was 50 meters (164 ft) deep. And the first drop I did with &quot;lubb&quot; (cusk). How do you call that in English? I don't know. An ugly fish. The fish that you don't want. We put on a small cusk. First drift, I just though I was stuck at the bottom. And then the bottom started to swim. Should be show them how the bottom look. Yeah! And in the other end was this. This is a huge halibut. And it's so fat! Easily over 2 meters (6.5 ft). Show me the fin compared to your hand. It's a monster! You can just imagine how much power this one generates with its fin. It's just a huge muscle and I need a doctor. Hey guys! You know what. I just measured the rope. You want to hear how long it was? Yeah! 2,30 m (7.5 ft). 2.30! Are you kidding with me? No! 2.30, that is over 5 kilo. Hahaha, yeah! I thought it maybe wasn't so long as we though it was in the beginning because it was so wide. Yeah. It looked like short, but it's a huge fish! It's big in every aspect. Like the head is huge. It's even fat. You can see the belly going upwards. It has eaten. It's not a skinny fish and it's very wide. I think it's time for us to release this monster. You can see those famous teeth. We have seen some teeth marks from these fish in our baits. Releasing this monster down to the depths. A little kiss! Thank you very much! It was a pleasure meeting you. Wow! Would you have a look at that! What a monster. Oh my god! Congratulations! Thank you! The things you gewt to experience in fishing! Yeah! Amazing! 2 meters, 30 centimeters. Not a bad fish. Not a bad fish at all. That was the first drift. I'm all dizzy. Let's get another one. Let's get a big one! Yeah, a big one..! A well deserved break after this big halibut. Cheers! Cheers guys! When the fish came up and when we measured it, when you hold the rope. I though maximum 2,10-2,15. I was so surprised and shocked that it was 2,30. But you know, I'm almost 2 meters. And I could hold my arm almost straight with the rope. What a fish! 1,10 in width and 2,30 in length. That is a crazy fish. 150-160 kg (330-350 lb) maybe? For me it's so hard to estimate a fish like that. You know, that's the biggest one I've seen. I have nothing to compare it with. Me too. Oh, damn! What a bite! This one feels better, I must say. This is a halibut. Okay, let's go! Oh, damn! Okay, that is not a cod. It's not moving. What do you think, could this be like a angry 30 kg (66 lb) fish? Could be. But it feels like it has some weight to it too. But I've never been fighting a big halibut on this rod before. Crazy! So long! It doesn't feel enormous. But it's defintely a good fish! You see it? Yeah, but now I don't. He saw the boat. Okay, we have color. Are you ready, Marre? Nice job! It's a nice fish! 175 cm (5.7 ft)! That's a nice one! That's my biggest on artificial bait. Cool! And on BangerShad. Yeah, on the BangerShad. On black/silver. Both fish on this one. Yeah, the black/silver. Back in black! Fish plate. Cheers!
