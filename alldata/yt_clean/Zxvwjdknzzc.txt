&gt;&gt; I've been a student of the and searching for the truth. As a Bible teacher in the if Israel's United Were the first kinds Are the Biblical like David and Goliath accurate? My name is Jeremy Dehut and a seasoned traveler He's been to Israel and he'll be my guide on our We're going to talk to experts and examine the geography, to what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; We're going to be able that have bearing on I think we should where the scriptures begin. The story of the United &gt;&gt; Did Shiloh exist? Was it a real place? Does it match the location Does the function of the that it did in Biblical text? Was it a Holy site? Were sacrifices offered there? Those are all questions by the study of archeology. &gt;&gt; Back in the 1980s, Israel Finkelstein lead and you can see the exposing the big that surrounds the What we have done is take his of us the work that the Danish and we're connecting the two. &gt;&gt; Now, the tabernacle for several hundred years. Do you have any places where you think it stood? &gt;&gt; It's all about the Mishkan, and I think it answers that most like, &quot;how do I connect The tabernacle gives us a way so critically important. And, in the center of it So, these are the main on the northern platform Was it on the summit, Number three, it could have There's four churches on Well, the Christians seemed of the tabernacle being there because they're building their It may have also It's very flat and it Now, I've introduced And, that's that the tabernacle It was not in one spot. By its very nature, it's mobile. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They are slaughtering Certain times of the year, if you've got the and the wind is blowing this to be unbearable Maybe seasonally, the tabernacle So, it's not that maybe the whole site is sacred. &gt;&gt; And, are you finding on this site during the iron age when Samuel was supposed &gt;&gt; Oh, absolutely. We've got abundant You see a transition here sometimes we say Canaanites, they're Amorites actually In some ways, you can see or a different theological Do we see a shift in Do we have Hebrew Yes, we do. So, there's no doubt that in that there were Israelites &gt;&gt; We're just inside this 5 that went all the And, what we have that are built against this. What we're after of the stratification And, you can see the of tumbled, crumbly, into a brownish reddish soil, So, that's about Now, we know we're Something definite We're reading the balk. What we believe is that right here. This is the period of We've got late bronze, middle and Hellenistic and You had to trim the balk so that When I do, we're going So, now we can get That's been worked, hasn't it? &gt;&gt; That is so light. &gt;&gt; So, that is clearly manmade. It's pumas, so put it in our As we trowel through, there's &gt;&gt; It looks like a rim. &gt;&gt; So, this is a This looks like it's from the Now, here's a bone. &gt;&gt; What type of animal and in what quantities? &gt;&gt; We found two to three times at Shiloh in season in our other excavations. And, I think that's -- we've &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We have an ancient text, that there was a cultic side that operated a sacrificial There was a massive favessa or on the east, only bones from within that bone deposit. And, interestingly, we In the pre-Israelite period, into the Israelite That's a significant drop. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And, so again, that's that there's a change in or at least their value systems. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Their cultic understandings So, the bones are very &gt;&gt; That's charred pottery. That's good. We've got the naked eye then we have a metal now we're checking a third through wet sifting We found that when many times you could have as a scarab that still And, when you wash You realize the things [ Background Noise ] Maybe we're going to Yeah. We're already seeing grit. We could have Hebrew You can already see - between the pottery and what we haven't washed. So, it's popping. Sometimes we're wanting So, I want to double check so we'll take something and when we get in the under a microscope and I have of a Hebrew letter It could be a random marking, so I want to get it [ Music ] So, let's pull out these pieces we'll analyze them more closely &gt;&gt; The development of the for the Israelites through the thing to follow. And, I think the text implies that Shiloh was actually after the death of Eli and his The central place of worship I was thrilled just &gt;&gt; Scott knows of a It's in an undisclosed location. A number of these labs have or they may be politically or they don't like to where these labs are located. &gt;&gt; Our lab is pretty You find a space you get good lighting. You've got tables together, perhaps some chemicals and this is the way Some of these artifacts that to look at them under and see some things in the field, obviously. I know one of the things that really caught your Looking to see if there are any lettering, anything that's And, I'm also looking at And, it's exactly So, we would pretty confidently Maybe once every season we about 2,000 broken pieces a day. When it has writing on it, And, now it is elevated &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; -- to a whole another level. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; This also caught our eye. It's pumas. Why did it catch our eye? Because it's not I mean, somebody brought where we have the volcanic It's clearly manmade, And, it is kind of exciting under here, you'll end up of gold that's embedded that that gives you a clue. That's an interesting piece. Now, the bone analysis at because we're dealing with a &gt;&gt; What you were saying that that percentage with an Israelite occupation, of pig bone go down to 1%. &gt;&gt; Well, when you're moving from say an Amorite controlled you see a significant drop that they're consuming. So, we're not talking &gt;&gt; No, we're not. &gt;&gt; We're talking real places, and real events. Notice now under magnification and all kinds of things. When I sit with our I'm just fascinated the things that she's seeing Okay, yeah, see if you can &gt;&gt; When you've got you're able to do &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Once it's all been and you want to hang onto it &gt;&gt; We have a storage unit at the Israeli Antiquity to our material. Every one of these has an So, when we want to go back and we can easily get it out. I hope you have high and no matter how high they are, So, this is one of my because you can see that it's and it's super organized. &gt;&gt; How big is this place? &gt;&gt; Oh, this is the size of &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Just think back to the where they're storing Welcome to that warehouse. In archeological terms, about the United about what we would call between Iron I and Iron II. This entire section is Iron I from about 1200 to 1000. &gt;&gt; That's huge. &gt;&gt; So, if you want to of the judges would like and into Saul, what was the This is it. This is what we would Very typically Israelite. You find one of these, inside a four room house and now we've got ethnic with a different material The pottery is somewhat because remember, God had in houses you didn't build. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're going to occupy They really don't know a at this point, so when around the year 1400, the pottery types don't until around the year 1200. So, those first couple they're very homogenous Amorite culture that's here. &gt;&gt; Which makes sense. &gt;&gt; They're learning from them -- &gt;&gt; They're learning. Right. &gt;&gt; -- how to make pottery. &gt;&gt; One of the reasons I like this and looking about it is because, quite that much about pottery. And, so there's a and what I need to know. And, I think in doing so of the way those and the people of the time. &gt;&gt; For most people, when they of pottery, they would just to be so boring [laughter], digging up broken It's got to be all the same. And, what you've [ Music ] &gt;&gt; No, it's not. &gt;&gt; It shows the development artistic expression, &gt;&gt; One of the greatest that I learn something &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And, yes, I'm an expert, but all that has done to understand how much I don't I just have this strong desire then and there in the setting so that I can peel and reevaluate what I believed &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; -- set it in a &gt;&gt; I think there's a I think that even the there's a strong desire You mentioned that to triangulate a time period by What are those methods? &gt;&gt; Okay. So, we look because when you have it'll say year three of, and The Latin word scarabaeus what we have are each one of &gt;&gt; Look at that. &gt;&gt; What you have is each he creates his own iconography So, we have very and no future pharaoh ever So, when we can get a scarab in we can use it to All of these scarabs on it, so at some point -- &gt;&gt; Look at that. &gt;&gt; -- before these somebody pulled the but this one, it So, you can see how beautiful &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We do get them down At Khirbet el-Maqatir, we found somatic scarab, which was in Israel, so it was So, they are a very, very &gt;&gt; There's a school of thought that increasingly that the United monarchy They think that the and Solomon are propaganda With all the time that you've in Israel, what do you &gt;&gt; Well, we have two schools of which are saying but it wasn't exactly Then, we have another group, mythicists that are that it didn't even We have found the opposite. We have found in the material that there was a river, if there was a mountain, a we find just many, that passes the smell test. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's what you from the literary And, so we have found just between the archeological &gt;&gt; The time that you've and exploring the that it's reinforced your faith. &gt;&gt; Right. I was a Christian so it did not bring me to to examine the tough questions. Sometimes we do have questions but in archeology, of evidence is not Just because something happened, and we can't find well a lot of things could Wind and rain and future foundations clean. We've only excavated about 95% is still underground. And, so when we do between what we expected when we in the culture, you think in the other 95%? &gt;&gt; Yeah. There's &gt;&gt; Our direct goal is or to bring people to is there an apologetic You better believe there is and &gt;&gt; I think it was with the archeological piece. Just the shear volume in the material culture and to synchronisms from the I wish everyone could feel into that site and to feel just there is so much here and such to a united monarchy and the There's a lot more to do, but I think this was a to answer this question. I think it's important to especially the Philistines through I and II Samuel. Israel's enemies play a key role They wanted a ruler that would for them like the That is a part of the catalyst to the Lord and find &gt;&gt; During the reigns of we read about a number that they had battles with, up every couple of chapters We are in one of the This is the city of Ashdod. Now, these ruins around us are so they're much later than the &gt;&gt; Do we know where the &gt;&gt; Yes. A lot of those ruins This is one of the five cities Ashdod and Ashkelon and Gaza to the coast. Gath and Ekron are about on the eastern side As we read through the really first interaction with a battle between and the Philistines a The Israelites lost and so they thought they would as the arc of the covenant Well, unfortunately, the and brought it to &gt;&gt; Now, that did not &gt;&gt; It didn't. &gt;&gt; When the arc of the is brought into Dagon's temple in the next day, Dagon, this in front of the arc And, so you have their idol and adoration in front And, they prop him back up and until the next day but his head has been removed and they're lying on the God has humiliated, he has defeated what these &gt;&gt; Once the citizens of they sent the arc of the and then it stayed there for a to Ekron and at that point, the we need to send this and they sent it &gt;&gt; It is so gorgeous right here. Just beyond here as you move Why would the Philistines into the Jordan Rift Valley? &gt;&gt; Well, like any they want to expand their to control more people. And, of course, if they were they would use them as &gt;&gt; Not only do we of the major events took place but even their enemies, and rooted. We know where their &gt;&gt; The best way to understand between the Philistines to not only know the people, And, probably the best way to &gt;&gt; I think to understand of the United Kingdom, to understand the And, of course, there's that than from the air. And, so what we're going to do, over the Shephelah, which was an and the hill country between the Philistines who and the Israelites, which There was not very from the Mediterranean Sea Those small valleys extremely important. &gt;&gt; Whoever controlled the &gt;&gt; That is exactly right. And, that just jumps out from this perspective. We're looking west The Philistines after to the Israelites put it up this valley that the citizens of Beth Shemesh saw the arc down there and got it. Just south of the Sorek up on the Elah Valley. It's raining down here &gt;&gt; We're not able to &gt;&gt; Not right now. &gt;&gt; I can take you to &gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Yeah, okay. &gt;&gt; Jerusalem, okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [ Foreign Language ] &gt;&gt; Okay. We are approaching Okay. We're flying almost of David right now, which was that David and Joab conquered. &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow, I see it. &gt;&gt; The Dome of the sitting on top of &gt;&gt; It's amazing to see the typography change &gt;&gt; This land is so small, to 50 miles wide and, you to Beersheba, but the and contours of the Try for the Elah Valley? &gt;&gt; Continue? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. The Elah Valley goes You can see the entire The Philistines were on the The Israelites were on the You can see the mountain with the brook running This is the brook that up his five smooth out to fight against Goliath. This is a beautiful, beautiful &gt;&gt; That's an incredible &gt;&gt; ...Where his famous &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. In just a minute, we're going to come Gath, of course, was It's kind of ironic to as a young boy may have which was the same brook that that later killed him. &gt;&gt; Oh, this has been I mean, how often do you get [ Foreign Language ] &gt;&gt; It was so helpful to an actual archeological dig and see how the archeological then to go to the IAA warehouse and seeing everything &gt;&gt; I loved how organized &gt;&gt; There's just so much to the period of the judges and seeing Ashdod and realize that not just the Israelites in the land, but even the the Philistines, left The plane ride gave a that you really needed and see how the valleys moved, All of that together that corroborates the first as the period of The United Kingdom history to the kings where Samuel named Saul. Is there any evidence that of the kings of Israel &gt;&gt; Yeah, I believe there is. I can think of three that you will enjoy going to. In fact, one of them of the most famous
