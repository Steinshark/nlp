- [Michael] Hi, I'm Michael. This is Lessons from the Screenplay. Don Draper, the protagonist Mad Men knows how to tell a good story. After all, his success as a hinges on creating an emotional bond between a consumer and a product. To do this, Don uses all There's the slogan, or text, - Bell Jolie Lipstick, mark your man. - [Michael] There's the the subtext. - She wants to tell the world, he's mine. He belongs to me, not you. She marks her man with her lips. - [Michael] And finally, evocative visuals that enhance The writers of Mad Men to craft emotionally resonant stories. In each episode, we watch characters struggle to maintain stoic facades in order to disguise the pain that lives just below the surface. So today, I want to examine one particular episode of Mad Men, the titled The Wheel. To explore how the and symbolic imagery to and to see how Don Draper himself brings all these story in one of the show's most Let's take a look at Mad Men's The Wheel. In his book, Story, Robert McKee explains the difference between text and subtext. &quot;Text means the sensory &quot;In film, it's the images &quot;of the dialogue, music, &quot;What we see. &quot;What people say. &quot;Subtext is the life under that surface, &quot;thoughts and feelings &quot;hidden by behavior.&quot; The text is simply what is happening on the surface of a story. And in this episode, it's used to set up Don's plot line. - I went to the athletic club today and learned that Kodak still isn't happy with the campaign for - [Michael] Don's is to put together a pitch to try to win a big account: Kodak. - They call it the donut, or the wheel. They're expecting something - [Michael] But in addition the text also introduces the theme of Don's arc in this episode. - [Michael] Don has been over family, but more importantly, Don is struggling to understand - [Michael] All of this set We see and hear Duck - If you could find a way to into something with some legs, you could make me look - [Michael] And witness Don - I don't think you want to go. - I'm sorry, was I unclear about that? - [Michael] When Don does at the end of the episode, the client assumes his pitch will operate on this literal level of text. - So have you figured out a - We know it's hard because as exciting technology, even - [Michael] Don acknowledges works this way, by novelty or gimmick. - But there's the rare can be engaged on a level beyond flash. If they have a sentimental - [Michael] Don is talking about creating a deeper level of meaning, subtext. In this episode, subtext is used to push characters along their arcs, and communicate their mental In particular, subtext in every beat of Betty's storyline. Betty's story begins when makes an unscheduled visit. Francine has opened her phone bill to discover that her husband - Do you know he spends two I'm so stupid. - [Michael] The text of the scene is pretty straight forward. But there is a moment of subtext that creates the inciting - [Michael] Both characters of this exchange, even acknowledge it in the text. Francine is implying that After Francine leaves, phone bill from Don's office. Without a single line of dialogue, we understand that Betty Later, because we know we understand that when she tells Don about the incident with Francine, she's actually interrogating him about their own marriage. - Sit with me. - [Michael] This makes the scene loaded with subtext, as that Betty is not really talking about the other couple at all. - [Michael] And Don, - [Michael] So afterward, and calls one of the numbers, to discover that Don has been secretly talking to her psychiatrist. - [Michael] This sets up the final beat of her character arc, which takes place at Her psychiatrist thinks - [Michael] But we understand via subtext that she's actually using Dr. Wayne to confront Don about his infidelity. - [Michael] Betty confirms her suspicions, all without mentioning it to him in a single line of text. Don also understands the power of subtext. Returning to his pitch to Kodak, after Don again acknowledges the power of a straight forward textual approach, - [Michael] He presents he envisions for this campaign. - [Michael] Right before introducing the final tool that he uses to emotionally affect an Within this episode the show's creators borrow imagery loaded with cultural meaning and then manipulate that imagery to enhance the emotion of the story. For example, when Pete Campbell exchanges a wedding gift for a gun, a symbol of power and masculinity, - Same price as a chip and dip. - [Michael] He's really telegraphing how emasculated and lost he feels. When Lane Pryce's wife buys him a Jaguar, not knowing that he's lost everything, Lane ironically uses the symbol of freedom to try to take his own life. And after Don and Peggy trying to develop a pitch for a suitcase, an object that represents travel, Don has a vision of a much The Wheel episode also associated with the As he struggles to come for Kodak's slide projector, a device often used to each step of his journey is punctuated by photographic imagery. When Don finds a childhood photograph of him and his estranged brother Adam, he's inspired to get - His name is Adam Whitman. - [Michael] But the promise quickly disappears in the tragic reality. - Jesus, I hate to be but he hung himself. - What? - [Michael] Don avoids the by drinking and working even harder. Asking Harry for help on the Kodak pitch. The conversation turns in photography and why he thinks photos have such emotional power. - [Michael] The simple representing happy family memories is complicated by the But the full power of photographs isn't demonstrated until the last moments of Don's presentation to Kodak, as they win him the sale, As he begins his slide show, Don once again artfully uses all the tools at his disposal. - [Michael] Don uses the the words that he's speaking, - [Michael] To explain the to the consumer. - [Michael] And he uses symbolic imagery, actual slides, - [Michael] To enhance - [Michael] But at the same time that Don is using these - It's not called the wheel. - [Michael] The show's creators are using these tools on us. - It's called a carousel. - [Michael] In the text of the scene Don is simply pitching Kodak, completing his plot line for the episode. But because we've seen the problems he's facing in his marriage, and the painful revelations his words are loaded with subtext. And finally, there's symbolic imagery. - It let's us travel - [Michael] The family photos - Round and around, and back home again. - [Michael] Demonstrating that the importance of family. - To a place where we know we are loved. - [Michael] The episode concludes with one final powerful symbolic image. - Hello? - [Michael] When Don arrives home ready to embrace his family and spend Thanksgiving with them. - I'm coming with you. - You are? - Daddy's coming with you. - Daddy! - [Michael] An image before the truth is revealed. - Hello? - [Michael] That happy - Hello? - [Michael] It's merely a place he now aches to go again. - Good luck at your next meeting. - [Michael] It's no accident that Mad Men is set in the world of mid 20th century American advertising. There's no better time and place to explore the gap between between what people say and Just as advertisers create and use iconic images to shape the writers of Mad Men to reveal the inner contradictions of their characters' lives. And for us, just like for Don Draper, there lies surprising complexity, pain, and emotion beneath the surface of every episode of Mad Men.
