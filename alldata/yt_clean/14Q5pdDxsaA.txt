ANNOUNCER: THIS PROGRAM BY THE FRIENDS AND PARTNERS JOYCE: &quot;GOD IS ABLE ABOVE AND BEYOND ALL TO HOPE, ASK, OR THINK.&quot; IN YOUR PRAYERS. [MUSIC] JOYCE: FATHER, THANK YOU ESPECIALLY AS WE PREACH PRIVILEGES ON PRAYER. AND I PRAY THAT WE WILL UNLOCK PRAYERS TO BE ANSWERED, DIRECT WAY. THANK YOU, JESUS, AMEN. ALL RIGHT, WELL, FIRST OF ALL, LET ME SAY IS THE GREATEST PRIVILEGE IT'S NOT A DUTY IT'S SOMETHING WHEN WE PRAY, IT'S NOT IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF GOING THE CREATOR OF ALL THINGS, IN OUR OWN LITTLE PERSONAL WE CAN NEVER DO FOR OURSELF. AND SO, THAT'S REALLY AND YOU CAN PRAY ANYTIME, YOU DON'T HAVE YOU DON'T HAVE SPIRITUAL POSTURE. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE SET APART BUT YOU CAN PRAY YOUR WHAT I CALL JUST, YOU KNOW, OF YOU MAYBE JUST-- PRAY ABOUT THAT.&quot; YOU CAN PRAY RIGHT NOW. SO, THE FIRST HINDRANCE AN ANSWER IF YOU DON'T ASK. SO, FIRST, YOU GOTTA PRAY. AND IT'S INTERESTING HOW MANY AND ACTUALLY, THAT WORD &quot;ASK&quot; ALREADY BELONGS TO YOU. THAT'S INTERESTING, ISN'T IT? SEE, JESUS ALREADY BOUGHT SPIRITUAL AND MATERIAL, IF WE DON'T ASK FOR IT. YOU HAVE NOT AND MANY PEOPLE DON'T ASK THEY'RE DESERVING. OR THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT GOD BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE THINGS THE CASE MIGHT BE. BUT YOU'RE ONLY CHEATING GOD INVITES US TO ASK. SEVEN TIMES SEVEN TIMES HE SAID, &quot;ASK.&quot; I TELL YOU, WHOEVER BELIEVES I'VE BEEN DOING, AND EVEN WILL THEY DO, BECAUSE NOW, YOU KNOW, TOOK ME A LONG UNDERSTANDING ON THAT SCRIPTURE. IT'S LIKE, HOW COULD ANYBODY WHAT JESUS DID? AND I WOULD ALLOCATE THAT HE DID, AND YOU KNOW, BUT I BELIEVE IT MORE PERTAINS AS A BODY OF BELIEVERS. AND I SAY THIS IN A RIGHT THAT I REACH MORE PEOPLE REACHED IN THE 33 YEARS THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING, ISN'T IT? [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: THAT'S BECAUSE GOD HAS MADE AVAILABLE, TO TAKE OVER AND USE. AND WE NEED TO USE THOSE AROUND THE WORLD. AND SO, WE CAN REALLY IT'S AMAZING HOW MANY PEOPLE MANY PEOPLE MUST SIT WITH THEIR LONG, JUST LOOKING AT SOMETHING. WE PUT A SILLY PICTURE ON, ME TO DANCE WITH HIM. HOW MANY OF YOU SAW THAT? OKAY, SEE, A LOT OF YOU. WELL, IN A WAY, I HAD SOMETHING ON INSTAGRAM AND WE HAD 42,000 HITS, GOT OVER A MILLION POINT FOUR. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: I THINK, &quot;MAYBE MAYBE I'VE GOT A SECOND BACKUP A LOT OF PEOPLE TO WATCH THAT. SO, ASK. HOW MANY OF YOU AGREE THAT OF FEEL LIKE, WELL, MAYBE YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE--OR WE CAN I TELL YOU THAT GOD'S AND EVEN IF YOU'VE DONE SIMPLY REPENT, BE SORRY FOR IT, NEW DIRECTION, AND YOU CAN ASK GOD I REMEMBER A WOMAN THAT SHE WAS A CLERK IN THE STORE. AND WE TALKED WHILE SHE OR ANOTHER I FOUND OUT AND I WAS ASKING HER HOW THEY ON COMMISSION, OR JUST GET SHE SAID, &quot;WELL, WE'RE SALARIED, CRITERIA, WE HAVE TO MEET EVENTUALLY LOSE OUR JOBS.&quot; CONCERNED, BECAUSE MINE AND I SAID TO HER, WHICH SOUNDS &quot;WELL, DO YOU EVER PRAY THAT AND SEND CUSTOMERS TO YOU?&quot; A CHRISTIAN 30 YEARS, IT BE OKAY TO ASK GOD I SAID, &quot;YOU CAN ASK GOD FOR THING THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN SO, IT'S NOT--YOU DON'T AND I LOVE THESE, &quot;WELL, GOD, AND IF YOU'LL JUST DO THAT.&quot; THESE LITTLE BITTY--YOU KNOW, DO VERY MUCH FOR US, LIKE THE BIBLE SAYS. OBVIOUSLY, YOU NEED TO HAVE AND, YOU KNOW, BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW YOUR VOICE, AND HE WANTS AND HE WANTS YOU TO ASK HIM AND NEED, BUT AS YOU'RE GONNA MORE ABOUT SPIRITUAL THINGS AMEN? [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: SO, I'M NOT &quot;WILL YOU GET ME A NEW CAR?&quot; &quot;WILL YOU GET ME THAT?&quot; 'CAUSE THE BIBLE PLAINLY SAYS, THE KINGDOM, THAT THINGS &quot;SEEK FIRST THE KINGDOM AND DOING), AND THINGS AND IT SAYS, &quot;DELIGHT YOURSELF YOU THE DESIRES OF YOUR HEART.&quot; IN YOUR HEART THAT YOU WOULD AND IF YOU'RE MORE CONCERNED AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS THEN GOD WILL DO THOSE THINGS, THOSE DESIRES OF YOUR HEART. I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS WHY ANSWERED, IS BECAUSE WE'RE STUFF ALL THE TIME, AND NOT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. AND YOU'RE GONNA SEE THE TIME TO READ TO YOU THAT HE PRAYED FOR THE CHURCH, PHILIPPIANS, COLOSSIANS, AND NOT ONCE, NOT ONE TIME DID PAUL EVER ASK FOR ANY FROM THEIR PROBLEMS. NOR DID HE ASK FOR ONE OR FOR ANY OF THEM. HE ASKED FOR THINGS THAT, THE HEIGHT, THE DEPTH, OF THE LOVE THAT GOD AND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE EVERYTHING HE ASKED FOR, WAS THEM MORE MATURE SPIRITUALLY, AND MET THEIR NEEDS. SPEND TIME EVERY DAY PRAYING. AND ONCE AGAIN, TO GO OFF IN A CORNER, AND SHUT YOUR EYES, IT MEANS THAT YOU CAN JUST TALK AND IT IS GOOD, AS I SAID, TIME FOR PRAYER. WHERE YOU'RE--IT'S QUIET, GET QUIET ON THE INSIDE. AND, YOU KNOW, DO IT REVERENTLY AND YOU'LL BE AMAZED WHAT &quot;AND I WILL DO--&quot; VERSE 13, DO WHATEVER YOU ASK MAY BE GLORIFIED IN THE SON. YOU MAY ASK ME FOR ANYTHING NOW, I'M GONNA HAVE TO ADMIT OF TEACHING, I STILL CAN'T FULLY THAT WE CAN ASK FOR ANYTHING, SO, WE ALSO HAVE TO INTERPRET WHICH MEANS THAT YOU CAN'T OUT OF THE MIDDLE AND MAKE THERE ARE OTHER SCRIPTURES WE ASK ACCORDING TO HIS WILL, SO, GOD LISTENS TO OUR PRAYERS, HE KNOWS IS BEST FOR US, JOHN 15:7 AND 8, &quot;IF YOU REMAIN IN YOU, ASK WHATEVER YOU WISH, EVERYBODY SAY, &quot;ASK.&quot; JOYCE: &quot;THIS IS TO MY YOU BEAR MUCH FRUIT, AS MY DISCIPLES.&quot; ME, I CHOSE YOU AND I APPOINTED FRUIT--FRUIT THAT WILL LAST-- IN MY NAME THE FATHER THESE ARE SOME OUTRAGEOUS I MEAN, THIS IS--WHAT &quot;I AM GOD, COME TO ME AND I'LL DO IT.&quot; SOMEBODY SAY, &quot;WOW.&quot; JOYCE: YOU'RE LOOKING [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: YOU GOTTA YOU KNOW, ONE TIME, I FELT-- AND PROBABLY, YOU'LL JUST SAY, BUT I PRAYED THAT I'D BE ABLE ON THE WHOLE PLANET. I MEAN, I EVEN THOUGHT MYSELF, BUT I PRAYED IT ANYWAY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M SURE THAT I HAVEN'T REACHED IN OVER 100 LANGUAGES, IN ABOUT [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: SO, YOU KNOW THAT A WOMAN WITH A 12th GRADE BROKEN-HEARTED AND MESSED UP, OF PREACHING TO THAT MANY [AUDIENCE CHEERING] JOYCE: BUT LET'S REMEMBER, [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: I ASKED FOR SOMETHING THAT I DID NOT DESERVE, I WONDER HOW MANY THINGS BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T ASK. AND WE GET THAT THE DEVIL &quot;I DON'T DESERVE IT.&quot; HIM FOR REMINDING YOU, YOU DON'T DESERVE IT. I DON'T DESERVE IT. BUT THAT'S THE GREAT THING ABOUT WE'RE NOT PRESENTING TO GOD WE'RE PRESENTING WHAT JESUS IS. THAT'S WHAT THE AMPLIFIED BIBLE YOU'RE PRESENTING TO GOD, WHEN HE LEFT, HE SAID AND WE USE IT, TO USE JESUS' NAME, JOHN 16:26-27, &quot;IN THAT DAY I'M NOT SAYING THAT I WILL ASK NO, THE FATHER LOVES YOU BECAUSE BELIEVED THAT I CAME FROM GOD.&quot; FOR YOU, I'M GIVING YOU MY NAME, TO GO STRAIGHT TO GOD AND ASK I WONDER IF ANYBODY IS GETTIN' POWERFUL THIS IS. WOW. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: ALMOST MAKES BUT PRAY ALL THE TIME. THIS WAS HIS INSTRUCTION PRIOR WHERE HIS SUFFERING BEGAN. AND WE MISS A GREAT DEAL IN LIFE THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT GOD WHAT YOU CAN EVEN IMAGINE. &quot;GOD IS ABLE TO DO EXCEEDINGLY ALL THAT WE COULD EVER DARE C'MON, I DARE YOU TO BE DARING JUST LIKE WHEN I ASKED TO HELP THAT--I MEAN, I DID THAT, EVEN TO ME. BUT I ASKED. JAMES 4:2, NOW, I READ THAT THIS MORNING. AND THIS IS A DIFFERENT &quot;YOU DESIRE BUT YOU WHICH REALLY MEANS YOU KNOW, IT'S PITIFUL WE RESENT AND DISLIKE THAT HAVE WHAT WE WOULD DON'T BE--IF WE'RE JEALOUS WE'LL NEVER GET WHAT WE WANT. DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID? [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: AS LONG AS WE'RE ELSE HAS, WE WILL NEVER I THINK SOMETIMES IT'S A TEST SOMEBODY IN FRONT OF US THAT'S TO HAVE, AND THAT WE DON'T HAVE, FOR THEM, OR IF WE'RE GONNA AND DISLIKE THEM. JEALOUSY IS A BIG PROBLEM. IF YOU'RE JEALOUS OF A SIBLING, YOU WORK WITH, YOU NEED TO ASK AND START PRAYING FOR THEM THAN THEY ARE. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: YOU KNOW, I JUST IN EACH OF THE GOSPELS THERE'S OF WHEN JESUS WAS IN THE GARDEN THROUGH WHAT WE REFER AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REALIZE WANNA GO TO THE CROSS. THREE TIMES--THREE SEPARATE AND SAID, &quot;FATHER, IF POSSIBLE, NEVERTHELESS YOUR WILL SO, WITH EVERYTHING TO GO TO THE CROSS. AND I DON'T THINK IT WAS SO MUCH AS IT WAS HIM TAKING I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE HOW FOR SOMEBODY AS AMAZING THE SIN OF THE WHOLE WORLD. THE BIBLE SAYS, &quot;HE BECAME SIN.&quot; &quot;IF IT'S POSSIBLE, LET THIS CUP WILL BE DONE, AND NOT MINE.&quot; TO GO TO THE CROSS, [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: THAT KINDA GOT ME JUST HAVE BEEN LIKE FOR HIM. AND YET, HE DID IT FOR US. AND HE GAVE US THE PRIVILEGE AND ASKING IN HIS NAME, FOR IT'S AMAZING. YOU HAVE NOT BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THAT LITTLE VERSE CHANGING FOR ME. BECAUSE IN THE AMPLIFIED, STRIFE, AND FIGHTS, AND FEUDS, YOU WANT ALL THIS STUFF, SO YOU FIGHT, AND YOU WAR, OF OTHER PEOPLE. THEN IT VERY SIMPLY SAYS, YOU ASK NOT.&quot; I THOUGHT, &quot;WELL, I'M DONE BEING FOR ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING THAT I WOULD WANT.&quot; [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: WHY NOT? NOW, YOU KNOW, JUST GONNA GO TO GOD THEN OUR MOTIVES ARE ALL WRONG, MATTER OF FACT, I'VE LEARNED WHICH I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND. I REMEMBER ONE TIME WHEN GOD IT WAS WHEN I WAS STUDYING I WAS ASKING FOR TOO MUCH STUFF, WAS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND GOD WAS REALLY, AT THAT ME ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE P-R-E-S-E-N-C-E, P-R-E-S-E-N-T-S. AND GOD CHALLENGED ME TO NOT HE GAVE ME PERMISSION TO AGAIN, DON'T ASK ME FOR ANYTHING TRY THAT FOR A WHILE. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: AND IT WAS YOU KNOW, THINGS WOULD COME GOD FOR SOMETHING, AND I'D SAY, IS MORE OF YOU, MORE OF YOU.&quot; IN THE RIGHT ORDER, THEN THERE'S WORLD CAN OFFER, THAT GOD DO WE REALLY THINK STUFF FOR THE SINNERS? BUT HE WANTS US TO BE ABLE 3 JOHN 1:2, &quot;BELOVED, I WOULD PROSPER AND BE IN HEALTH, AND SO, WE COULD SAY THAT &quot;ACCORDING TO YOUR LEVEL AND ABILITY TO HANDLE IT, AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU WANT.&quot; US MORE THAN WE CAN HANDLE, AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. MONEY CAN BE DANGEROUS, BY SOMEBODY WHO LOVES GOD, AMEN? [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE AND I'M SURE IN OTHERS, AND THEN THEY GET FAMOUS, AND THEY START GETTIN' THINGS, ON 'EM TO DO THIS AND THAT AND THEN THEY END UP GETTIN' I ASK GOD ALL THE TIME, DON'T GIVE ME MORE THAN I CAN AMEN? [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: I DON'T WANT ANYTHING THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN GONNA DRIVE YOU AWAY FROM GOD, CLOSER TO HIM. AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, THE MORE YOU SHOULD GIVE. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: YOU START YOU START GIVING A PORTION NO MATTER HOW SMALL IT IS. WHO'S ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS THE WOMAN WHO GAVE SOMETHING THE WIDOW'S MITE. MATTER OF FACT, WE DON'T AS SMALL AS WHAT SHE GAVE. HOW MANY OF YOU ARE OLD WHEN THEY HAD MILLS? MY GOSH.

AND SO, YOU MIGHT GO BUY DOLLARS, AND SO MANY CENTS, WELL, YEAH, &quot;WHAAAT?&quot; [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: WELL, THEY GOT BUT, SO, LET'S JUST SAY THAT TWO MILLS, LESS THAN A PENNY, TALKED ABOUT IN THE BIBLE. SO, WE'RE NOT TALKIN' AMOUNT, [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: AND JESUS SAID, BUT YOU GAVE ONLY A LITTLE AND I THINK THAT JESUS IS NOT WE GIVE, AS HE IS WHAT WE HAVE AMEN? ALL RIGHT, I'LL GET OFF MONEY [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: DO YOU KNOW THAT MONEY EVERYWHERE YOU GO, YOU IS IN CHURCH? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [AUDIENCE CHEERING] JOYCE: I MEAN, IF YOU THINK YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHY A NUMBER IN THAT AREA. THAT PEOPLE ALWAYS THINK ABOUT GIVING, THAT HE'S TRYING ANYWAY.
