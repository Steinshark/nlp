Today it's back to school for a little Minnesota, home of the Golden Gophers men's I'm Roger. Mike. Nice to meet you, Mike. How are you? Roger I'm very good, thanks. How you doing, Mike? Scott But I'm not here to puck around. I'm here to learn all I can about the You just don't expect to see a turkey Looks like he's going to let us go. Mike, You know, Turkey was almost our John Adams wanted the eagle. Thomas Jefferson wanted a dove. Really? Yeah. But Franklin wanted the A truly noble bird, he said. Franklin had a point. I guess I'm glad it's not the national bird. We wouldn't be able to eat them, right? Oh, well, this is a little closer than I Yeah, this is nice, right? We find ourselves in front of an escalator Can't clean them when they're moving. That'd be highly dangerous. Yeah. This escalator is inspected every performed once a year or as needed. How long is this going to take? I think we're going to take most of the day. We have to pull some steps so we can get Once we got the top end cleaned, we're going back running again. Have you been into many dirty bottoms Several dirty bottoms? Yep. Will we be wiping the bottom? We will wipe the bottom. Okay, so we have to go up top and get the So I guess we're heading upstairs. Yep. All right. So we're going to lift, And now we're going to take it. And now we're going to slide it back. All right, so now we got to power up. This is the disconnect right here. Right here, Mike. So this is simply the mechanism that allows This gives the controller voltage and we got in the past. So we take a lot of safety Why would they blow up? They must be going to ground somewhere So if there is voltage going through there, But we've seen a lot of videos where someone shoots this blast of tremendous heat and it They're burnt bad. So. You know, there are some rules that we have danger as possible. Sure. The inherent risk of maintaining an escalator Oh, it's. True. Oh, very much so, Mike. Yeah, There are inherent dangers. Slips and trips, electrocution, you know, So, okay. I brought you some PPE, earplugs, gloves, When you turn the power on, we all kind of Okay, so you're kind of on your own at that You're freaking me out, Roger. But these are. All the things that you don't think of until Until you're suddenly going up like flash Right. And. And earplugs. Yeah, because it can boom. What's that do? It's So you don't conduct electricity. Oh, so this will sort of ground me. Unground you. We would never want to be directly over the So you just want to reach over. Stay out of the way and just turn it on. Pull it on. Just like this? Yep. Turn it like this. Yep. And the odds of this exploding are very low. Very low. But it. Could happen. It could happen. This could be the shortest segment in the We're going together. All right, I'm going to turn it this way. Well done. That's it. That's it. Well done. We're still here. Power is now. We made it. It's on. Yeah. All right. So what does that mean? So now we're going to transfer it down to the Yeah, and then we'll be taking some steps Do we go down the escalator? Do we take the stairs? We'll take the. Stairs. Okay. You could say that repairing and process. Many steps. So have you ever pulled an escalator step I haven't. Now, this is a this is a new one for me. I did the elevator thing. That's me in an elevator shaft. 100% certain that Dirty Jobs would not be on Wrong. We're going to lift it up. Yep. All right. And then I'll kind of kick that. Now we're going to slide her back. Yep. So now what we're going to do is we're This goes inside here and we relock it, and Button here. That's a stop button. Yep. Before I run, I always bail her out. Going up like four. On the golf course. Exactly. Going up escalators in environments like in a single day. And then here. Comes the whole we came here and pulled out a few for you to pull. Well, thanks. Yeah, yeah, that's great. And that's the whole I'll be dropping into to get the shot. Do we get in there? You know. Mike, I think for this first part here, I Okay. We're going to be shoulder to Sorry. With me. Belly to belly, Cheek to jowl. Yeah. It doesn't bother me a bit. You, you and me. All two of us together in Sounds great. The escalators mechanism is locked in place Can I touch like this? You can. I can. Touch anything. There's really no easy way to get in. That was perfect. Thanks. Remember we talked about Simone That was. Yeah. Yeah. Well, if she were here, she'd flip Stick the landing. Here I come. Here it comes. This ought to be great, Mike. We now need to switch sides. Let's do it. Which way are you going? I'm going to go this way. Scott Bumper. Good man. Well done, Mike. Thanks. Nice transfer. Thank you. So now all we need to remove the You just loosen these off. Pull it out? Yep. And then you just hoist it out. Just like that. Up to Roger. There you go, Roger. Thanks, Mike. There's a step for you. So now we're going to get out of the pit. I feel like. We just got in the pit. Scott Well, we did. We'll take the stairs. We get in the pit, we loosen it up. We'll grab the thing, we'll We'll do it again. A few times. We're going to burn some I can use it. You? I'm not saying anything. And here I was feeling guilty that I skipped So in my head now, man, I'm ready for this In spite of all of our precautions going up Up, up. And there felt like a little bit more. A little bit more up. Yeah, a little bit more up. Good. Perfect. Great, perfect. Good. Get back in the pit. Not yet, No. Nope. Oh, you got to. Turn this up. I'll have to verify each stop Right. So I'm going to push this down. Yep. Try to run it up or down? Up, down. Nothing. This goes down too, Right? Okay, so now this one goes down and that one Got to write down. This comes up now we double check here. Up. Nope. Nothing down. Nope, nothing there. So we just leave it all So check that. Now, obviously we're both in ahead and press that this down. Yep. Great. And we'll press this, of course, Now we get back in the. Pit, Now we get back in the pit. Only you're going to go by yourself. Okay? I'll miss you. I'll miss you, too. Well, that just got weird, huh? You're just doing one side at a time. There you go. Yep. Just like that. There we go. So the step is free. Now The step is free. And now I hand this to Roger. There you go. Well done. Well done. That's enough steps. We're good. Oh, we're good? Yep, we're good. Why wouldn't we take out all of the steps? Because once we rotate the escalator up to area that we can begin our clean down. I got it. I said I got it as though I got it, A lot of times, Scott, I'll nod my head. I was going to say, You're looking at me like But I don't every day. Mike Every day. Right. But you don't really you don't really You're just going, Oh, yeah, yeah. So you're floating along. Mike Right on par with normal apprentices. When I worked for Roger, I said, Yeah, I got Yeah, a lot. Yeah, but you didn't. You didn't really know. But you knew that eventually you would. I had to sooner or later. Understanding is not negotiable, and you the stakes are too high and safety is what That's correct. You as a supervisor need to yourself, does this guy really understand or agreement? Right. Yeah. Dangerous side. There comes a time in every job when you Are you ready? Yeah. All right. We're going back up the stairs. We're going up. For the record. We're not quite there yet, but we're getting So I turn away. All right, I'm going to turn this now. I hope there's not going to be an explosion. Powers off. We're locked off, but we're going So now we're going to remove that and just Okay. Before I can start work under the taken to ensure that the steps don't move Because that would be bad. Unspeakably bad. Obviously that's where all the power is, My Roger is coming up the steps for maybe He's carrying some straps. The brake is going to do its job. It's going to hold the unit. The straps are just redundancy. We've got to make sure it's not going to You can say that again. We got to make sure it's not going to move.
