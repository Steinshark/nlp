We're trying to master Let's talk about that Good Mythical Morning. Do you feel his presence? God? No. It's Belvedere. He demands sacrifice. We have to play his favorite game, that is weirdly similar Taskmaster. We shall appease you, oh great cockatrice. It's time for Belvedere says. Okay, Taskmaster baiters. Just like last time, everyone's already competed or tried Let's welcome in our other Participant Jordan. Jordan Morris participated in this? Yeah, I participated. You did this? Sorry I'm late. I was Taskmaster bating. If you, come on forward, don't be shy. But if you beat us. I don't. I, spoiler alert, I probably didn't. I really blew this, I think. I think I did a bad job. That's how you always feel If you're me. Let's see what Belvedere's demand was this time around. Well, hello, Belvedere. Hi. I'm in the show. Okay. Oh, my good friend Belvedere. Oh, hi, oh, exalted Belvedere. I have been, a good Belvedereite boy, praying to you daily, supplicating you for my needs. What you got for me? Make the Gatorade level rise to You have ten minutes to gather six things. Then you must put all six You may not put anything in the big And if any Gatorade leaves the you are disqualified. Okay, because I know y'all are If I read that. Your time starts now. Crap. You fell for it. This is your first time Yes. I have not done this before. It's stressful, isn't it? It is, because the crew is out there filming you, And they're quiet and they're watching, and know things. I felt like I was going insane. In my head, maybe I got hit by a car and this is all happening on I feel good knowing that you feel so strange about it. Yeah, like, And, you're asking questions like, Am I being misled in this way? And they don't react. You kind of feel like you're Yeah, that's exactly it. We all feel violated. Or maybe a game show. Maybe we're contestants on a game show. I did appreciate the catchphrase which was, Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just in case there's any doubt. Hey everybody, I'm on the show. Yeah. Feels like a sitcom line. I should have prayed to him. What was I doing? I should have knelt. That might have paid off. Do you supplicate every day to Belvedere? Of course. Yes, of course. Of course. Let's see if that pays off. All right, let's see how you did. So, we have Gatorade up here, we want it to go to the top. Ten minutes. Ten minutes. So much time. I'm gonna have to reread I wanna make sure it's Gatorade. So I gotta get it just up there, but I can't go over. Yes, of course, of course. Okay, I'm gonna gather. I'm gonna gather things. I'm just gonna gather things. Great. Here's some things. Oh, my gosh. There's so many of them. And what is this? This is another tank? If you put this whole tank into there. That's way too much. That'll come out. What will displace Gatorade? The balls. The balls will float. Why'd you put this tank here? What's the point of this? What's the point of this? I'm trying to figure out some sort of, some sort of spicy, really smart way to do this. A weight that'll probably Oh, boy. If you put something that floats in it, because that's how things work. That's how the world works. I need something that's gonna sink and have volume. If this could work, this may be a thing. Well, this also may be a thing. And this has a hole in the back of it. I actually think this is a candidate. Okay, I gotta pick something. I gotta. I gotta. It's got. I gotta do something that's gonna sink. Oh, I'm gonna ruin this. Is there some trick to this? Like, I really want something that's this shape. Beanie Baby. That's fun. How heavy is this? That's a floater. I need a bunch of stuff that won't float. Yes, yes, yes. So, like, the books. Books right there. That's nice. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Cheese slices? These are. I think it's. I think that's gonna. I think these are gonna work. Something feels nice about this. It's a fruit of some kind. Grape. I don't know. A brick is going to. Yes. See that right there? That's a brick. Brick's going right there. I'm going to win this one. Wait. Is this two items? I wonder. Is the mortar and the pestle two items? Am I getting rid of two? Okay, I'm just gonna use, you know, here's something I don't know. What's the mortar and what's the pestle? I know that this is a mortar and pestle, I need, like a. I need a block. What about. Okay, I'm just using this part. I think this is the pestle. I'm gonna say this is the Mortar, see you later. Pestle, you're one of the items. Let me just take a Where are the things that we step on? The wooden things that you step on? Can I. Yes. Something heavy. Something heavy. Where are the wooden boxes? We don't have any heavy things. What are we doing? Who are you trying to protect? Boy, this feels good. This feels good in the hand. I don't know. I think this will do something. I don't know. This kind of felt right It feels like the right amount of. The right amount of stuff. Look at what I found. That would have been perfect. What are we trying to prove with our What are we scared of? An earthquake that'll never happen. One, two, three, four, five. One more thing. One last thing. I guess this guy has been sitting here. I think. I don't think I want to use this. It's been here. I need to acknowledge it. I think this is too. This is gonna. Too much mass. Too much mass. I need something. Oh, that doesn't move. Oh. Oh. Don't. Don't spill. Yes. Okay, so then that goes. That, that, that. And now I just need something to fit there. Now I'm starting getting Maybe an Etch A Sketch. Yes, yes, yes. It's geometry. Yeah, that's good. I think. So, and I don't want this. Oh, six. One, three, five, seven, Crap. Okay. All right. I gotta get rid of these. These aren't good enough. Oh, yes. Yes. Five. You know, is the solution to this, go and get some more liquid somewhere? I don't have any liquid. Maybe that's the, like. Maybe that's, the hack that I should Can I get liquid? And is the liquid one of my objects? Yeah. Okay. I'll be right back. What is this material? So, this right here is the but there's got to be some. There's got to be a trick. Like, if I could get some and then all the other things Like what? Is there any liquid? Okay, okay, okay. I'm getting rid of. I'm getting rid of some of these. Last second. Last second. Switch One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five, and then. Okay, okay. All new strategy. All new strategy. The water is one of my items, and then I'm gonna pick tiny upset it too much. See you, all this stuff. Wow, what a waste of time that Okay, these are my six items, and I think this is gonna. So, give me. I have thirty seconds left. Give me a suggestion for occupation. Now I'm gonna do some improv. I heard carpenter. Thank you. Gonna do some improv. Six items. One, two, three, four, five, six. I'm done. Yes. Yes. One, two, three, four, five, and six. Time. The sixth thing is the water. We both got on the water train. Yeah, but I think what I'm seeing now and watching it back is But you should have used. The little tank. The other tank. Probably. That was clearly the thing to do. I don't know. Right? Because if you fill that then you get a bunch of other things, and then you start just Well, that is what we were thinking. I can't say that's what you were thinking. No, I wasn't. You weren't thinking. Do you have to finish? Would you have had to put all of the water completely in there, like, just poured water until it got Of course. It's just an item. I just want to shout out to the pointing to which one was the mortar. Yeah, you learn something every day. Yeah, you do. You were going on feeling, and so did I. Yeah, I was going on vibes. Yeah.

Okay, finally, we get to see what all the items Yes. So I know that these right here would displace a little bit of water. I'm gonna get a little bit. Oh, it's warm. You didn't tell me that. I thought that would sink. All right, item one. Water. Go down. Sink. Nothing's gonna fall out. Don't worry. No Gatorade's coming out. I think this was smart, I need to put this in there, plus some of the water, I'm an idiot. I don't understand buoyancy. Beanie Baby. I hope this isn't the Princess Di one, Oh. I thought it would sink but it's floating. Look at that. Oh, God. Oh, God. My plan was to pour the water until it got to the edge, but now I'm realizing the only is if I force all of these down. Holy crap. All right. Four false eggs. Okay. Okay. I should have gone with the other one. I knew it, because I would have just set it on But I believe that I can with this because it's gonna come in here and it's gonna float. And it's gonna settle at exactly the top. I feel dumb. I just feel like a dumb guy. Gotta get full displacement out of this. I don't wanna let go. How's that? Well, did I win? Look at that. Right at the edge. Look at it go. Oh, God... Oh, God. Please don't overflow, Oh, God, it's so perfect. Yes, yes, yes. Boom, baby. But I won before that happened. I won before that happened. Nope, hands are not one of the objects. We were so close.
