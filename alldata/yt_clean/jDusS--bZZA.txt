[D] This is my son and I love him very Do you know that you're, [S] I do [D] You think the Internet [S] No. [D] Now they do. Would you like to explain [S] We have a single barrel pistol, a triple barrel pistol. [S] Triple barrel pistol. I found these pistols at an antique shop time and eventually I So this one, very, The tag on it says it's a British That is extremely old. The second one here, double barrel. What I really like about this one is I think that's really, really cool. The tag on this one says it's a Belgium That's incredibly old. I've never shot pistols, And this one right here, I've heard this referred to as a duck foot of looks like a duck foot. Also, it's for clearing the deck on a boat At least that's what I read. And a buddy of mine when he first saw this like was the crowd pleaser. These things operate with what's Basically, I'll show So if I pull back the hammers, there's a thing called a nipple. You put a percussion cap on there and when and slams into that percussion cap. Now this double is pretty interesting I can fire them one at a time or both with this trigger over here. So we've got powder, we've got So here's a lead ball But first, this is So I read where you're supposed to do So that's a powder measuring tool. We got it set to about 10. So go ahead and get some We're going to make a mess. Got 10 grains of powder. [S] Need a little bit more. [D] Alright, now just pour it in the barrel. [S] It's really cool. [D] Alright, now if you tip that Over. Yes, sir. [D] So here's a really cool So we're going to put this patch Now put that lead ball Now push it down in with your thumb. Does it go? [S] Not really. Let me see. Kind of. All right, keep going. Don't break the handle, You want to compress it all the way. [S] Will the powder go off? [D] No, no. The powder's not as Did it go down anymore? [D] It looks pretty good. It's kind of scary, isn't it? I don't. [D] All right, pull that rod out. All right, so we got Let me get it set up so we can get a shot. I want to be the guy to fire this because I don't want you to get hurt. Not like it's from the 1850s [D] Right. So I'm going to put the. The percussion cap on the nipple. I'm going to hide behind titanium. I'm just going to be safe. This thing's old. Does it look in focus? [S] It looks like the end Like your hand and stuff isn't. [D] Tell me what to do. Keep going. There you go. Stop, stop. [D] I have no idea if this Ready? 1830S black powder. 10 grains. 3, 2, 1. [gun shot] It feel like it shot. [S] I pushed the button. I saw Smoke and I pushed the button. [D] Man, that was so ridiculous. That was like the nerdiest Open that thing up. [D] Oh, did it? [D] All right. Is it clear? [D] Let's see what the slow-mo says. Oh, looks like we did have problems. Looks like the sensor wigged out here. So you gonna shoot it this time? [D] That's pretty funny. [S] Let's do it then. [D] I love you. All right, so. You need a percussion cap? [D] have ears in? [D] All right, load your percussion cap. [S] Percussion cap is loaded. [S] Ready. [D] You look awesome. [Son] 3, 2, 1. [gun shot] [D] Got it. I saw the patch come out. And I also saw it hit [D] Oh, did you really? [S] Like it hit something [D] Okay, clear the gun. Obviously it is clear, Okay, look at that. [click] [then low rumble with cap igniting] [like someone softly hit a gong and its ringing out] [soft explosion sound as the gunpowder ignites] [D] As soon as it hits, look, You see that? [D] And so then it's lighting Takes quite a bit. It feels like a delay when you Oh, wow. Oh. So you got the ignition. And then once the powder goes, [S] So the hammer is going up three times. Once the hit the primer. Once the primer goes off, it goes up. Other once the powder explodes, [D] It does, doesn't it? I think we moved to the double. Is it weird? [S] It's kind of scary. [D] I'm gonna be real with you, son. You look pretty awesome. [S] Thanks, dad. [D] Three, two, one, fire. Okay, now we don't know if they both went. That's the interesting So. [S] Then pull the trigger again? [D] Just as a safety? Yeah, why not. So another one went? [S] Yeah. [D] But it didn't sound [S] Sounded like the percussion [D] But not the... Oh, wow. So we don't know. Good thing we have a high speed camera. So we're going to assume one [S] Yep. All right, let's see what happened. [soft click sound] [louder click sound] [mini explosion sound as the gun powder ignites] [D] The left one fired. The right one did not go. Go put a percussion cap on the right one. Just clear to. [gun shot] [S] Percussion cap, [S] That was only percussion cap. Oh, man. It's time for the nipple pick. [Destin Laughing] I bought a nipple pick. [S] Should that fire it? [S] Is that gonna fire it? I'm just trying to get Try to clear it. Yep. Three, two, one. [S] Only percussion cap. We're gonna assume And a ball in there, right? So we'll flood it later with water. Did papa bring his donkey? [S] He brought his donkey. [D] You bringing Miss Pearl over here? He wanted her on video, didn't he? Okay, we're gonna move on because Got it out. Is this Miss Pearl? [Papa] Miss Pearl. I've got a special camera. People have been taking pictures Oh, yeah, Got it. That'd be fine. [S] I like those pictures. [D] Yeah, they're neat, aren't they? [S] Is this percussion cap going to be bigger? [S] What is this for? [D] So like in the Civil War, They would. And if you had your rifle And you'd stick a new percussion cap on. Pretty interesting, isn't it, huh? What I think's so interesting about this that goes down through the nipple But on this one, [S] Has to be. I held this back and I put air pressure oh, look at that. And I made sure I was getting So it'll communicate. There's gotta be like a pipe Do you like doing that? [D] Yeah. [S] I don't think I could do it if [D] Yeah. I think a cartridge bullet style [S] So they go all the way down to the blocks. [D] So the bullets down in the block? [S] On the left, on the left [D] Okay. [S] But if you go to the middle one, [D] Interesting. [S] Looks good here. [D] Okay, Red circle? [D] Will you hand me this plate [S] Yes, sir. I'm ready. Oh, gosh. Could have a smoldering thing there. I'm gonna hold it for a second. You ready on the trigger? [D] 3, 2, 1. Man [D] 3, 2, 1. This isn't great. [S] Do a big cap with some powder under it. 1. [S] I really want this to work. [D] I want to work so bad, dude. Three, two, one. [gun shot] something happened. [S] I hit the button! [D] You hit the button? It felt like a single cylinder. [explosion sound] 1, 2. The other one went too. [explosion sound] Do, you want to load her back up? [S] I really want to [D] load that thing up. Did you pick the nipple? [D] Here's your nipple pick. It's a clean looking You know, it's an important thing nipple hygiene from his dad. [D] Do you feel that way? [S] I feel like you've taught me how [Destin laughing] [D] Okay. [S] Three, two, one. [just the cap went] [D] That scared me. [S] Three, two, one. It's getting annoying. The pirates have already taken our ship. Ready in 3, 2, 1. [D] What do you think we do? [S] I mean, if we were pirates, we'd die. [Destin laughing] [D] That's exactly. We'd get swash buckled real [S] We would. [S] Ready in three, two, one. [Gun shot!] [D] Made sure to. Did you push that time? [S] Let's go. Fizzle, fizzle, fizzle, boooooom. [S] So cool. [D] Oh, dude. [S] Is it like. [D] Oh, sick. Come here. [Explosion sound followed by gong ringing] [Destin once again laughing] Oh, man. The lock time is forever. I'll calculate it later. We don't have time It's clearly smoldering [S] Like, how long? Tens of milliseconds. The sponsor's ridge. What if we put three ridge wallets up all three of them? [S] We can try. [S] I don't know. Depends on how far away they are. [D] Ridge is the sponsor for this video, because I love my ridge wallet. I didn't think I would, It's so small, and it's really And I like the airtag money clip. This is a thing that helps me find which is a really big deal in my life. So I asked them if you could get So if you go to if you buy certain styles and a certain You can figure it out. But I highly recommend Also, they have many You can get them made out of leather. There's carbon fiber. There's even these minimalist wallets. So this is basically the smallest wallet about the size of credit cards. So check it out. Ridge.com/smarter. For now, it's time to go My son has a few minutes left Why are you gonna go to a dance? You could just still [S] I kind of want to still [D] Whatever, dude. You gonna walk me through it? [S] I'm gonna have to line the middle barrel back to where these barrels are. About in the same position. In the outside, because Like, that would be too close. So let's back up. So as you go back, the pie spreads out That's interesting. And there's also a component So this is like planar aiming, isn't it? I'd be lucky if I hit one. [D] Yeah, that'd be pretty significant. Okay, so I'm gonna go back here. [S] Three, two, one. [D] I think you nicked one. [S] I don't see nothing. [D] Oh, you hit it right here. You want to try one more time? [D] He's worried because he's about to go is his last opportunity. All right, ready? [D] Three, two, one, fire. [gun shot] [S] I missed again. All right, well, that was your shot. [D] Enjoy your dance [S] Now I'm not going to. [S] I'll be thinking about this the whole time. What do you think you missed? [S] I felt it felt low. [D] That time felt low. All right, well, you can go on, you're gone, and I'll get it. Do it for me, please. [S] Yes, sir. Now that my son is gone, will beat youth and skill. Move this thing a little closer, We'll play the angle game a little bit. We'll just move them in a little bit, huh? It's neat how that works. How did I miss? [Explosion sound] On plane, I'm going to aim lower All right. [gun shot] How on earth am I missing? [explosion in slow motion- deeper sound and longer duration] I could not figure this out. It didn't become clear what was And then if you roll it back and play Look close. But there's such a long lock time that I target, and then it fires. It's the lock time that's getting me. And maybe even the fact firing and I'm flinching. But that little bit of time My hand move off target. How?!? [gun shot] It worked! [Destin Laughing] That is so stressful! [explosion sound] All right, I hope you enjoyed I mean, clearly, My son is learning a lot about I mean, he's doing good with safety understanding of the fundamentals. Like a hands on. Not just a knowledge, of powder equals this kind And all gunpowder is not the same, I really enjoyed this Obviously be careful if I was firing these old antique firearms recommended, like half So be safe. I hope you enjoyed this. Big thanks to Ridge I'm sitting here looking at this, It looks like I was kind of like tilted Anyway, this is fun.
