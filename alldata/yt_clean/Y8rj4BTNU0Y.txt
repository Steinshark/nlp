I lost my mother and have no idea where my father is even to this day. So when I say I know because I''ve been in your shoes. I know you say God takes care But maybe God is directing me to you. I will not give up on you - Hey, Ray. Listen Ray, I''m sorry. I lost track of time. I spotted the girl so I know Ray, did you hear what I said? I just saw Dior, I can''t leave.

You know, make sure you''re okay. - Okay. - He likes ice cream, huh? - He likes everything. - Looks like he can use some exercise. Why do you have him in that stroller? - Well, he can''t keep up with me. - So how long you been on the street? - Who says I live on the street? - Well it''s pretty obvious. You don''t wanna look obvious. You wanna blend in, - Blend in? - That''s what I do. Here. How long has it been since you''ve eaten? - I couldn''t find any food yesterday. - Here you go. So where do you sleep? - Under the bridge. - That''s not very safe. - Where do you sleep? - Well, I have a place. And you''re welcome to stay with me until you figure things out. - You live here? - Shh, we gotta keep quiet. - So I can stay here? - Yeah, I have a sleeping - [Girl] Cool, thanks. - We just have to be I mean, if anybody knew it''d be over. And I do ask that you keeping up with your school studies. - School studies? - Yeah, everyday. You okay with that? - Sure, why not? Well, everything was good until my mom and dad got divorced. Minute that happened, my dad moved away. Then my mom married this, I don''t even know what you''d call him. He was nice at first, but My mom acted like it was nothing at all. So I was like, &quot;I''m outta here.&quot; - I''m sorry to hear that. - What about you? Why do you live in this storage unit? - My dad's in some kind of trouble. And they wanna put me in foster home, but they can''t catch me. - Why don''t you live with your mom? - She died. There is a woman that''s I think she''s from But I just don''t want to live in some stranger''s house, you know? I have everything I need right here. - How did you score this place? - It''s my dad''s storage unit. - How do you have all that food and stuff? - Well, he helps me. Plus, there are ways to make money. You just have to work So what do you want in your life? - I guess, for things to be - You want things to be resolved? - Well, yeah. But that won''t happen while he''s around. - What if I told you - I''d say that you''re full of it. What''s that? I found it in my mom''s things. But basically this is how it works. You write a note to God, and then in the night, he takes it. In time, all your problems get worked out. - That''s the stupidest - Well, it''s true. - And then all your problems are solved? - Yeah. Try it, what have you got to lose? - I think that you''re crazy. - Think what you want, but it works. - Prove it. - Write a note to God and for something in your life. - This is stupid. - Just close your eyes and think. - Okay. Got it. - Write it down and make - &quot;God, please give me - Okay, now it''s my turn. &quot;Dear God, &quot;thanks for my new friend. &quot;Love, Dior.&quot; - You didn''t ask for anything. - Well sometimes I just thank him for all that he''s done for me. Now put it up there. And make sure the words are facing up. - So what do we do now? - We wait until morning. - Do you ever miss your mom? - Every day. The hardest part is to talk to her ever again. - What was she like? - Smart. Funny. And strong. She liked to hug me a lot. - She sounds nice. - She was. - Hey, wake up. Wake up. One of them is still there. Yours is gone but mine's still there. - I don''t understand what happened. - I don''t believe in it anyways. (buzzer) (ominous music) - Step forward. - Mr. Strickland, my name child protective services. - She''s, your daughter''s fine. But I was hoping that you - What do you mean? You don't know where she is? - I ran into her in the park. - In the park? - She looked okay. I just don't know where - Did you check the motel? - Yes, she''s gone somewhere else. - So you guy's lost her? You don''t have any idea - Wait a minute here. I''m not the one who put - I didn''t steal anything. - Tim, they found stolen - So now we''re on a first name basis? - I''m sorry if the system - The system is responsible wandering the streets. - I absolutely agree. That''s why I want to find her. - And what are you gonna do - We''ll take her to a - Safe. In a halfway house full - Fine. You know, thanks for your help. - [Tim] What do you wanna know? - Anything you can tell me about her. - She''s been through a lot. She lost her mom two years ago. She''s intelligent. That''s why you''re not going to find her unless she wants you to. Never had to push her to do anything. She''s really focused. She''s smart. So smart. Smarter than I am. She''s gonna be something someday. - I can tell you love - I''ve let her down. - Do you know where she might' have gone? With a relative or maybe a boyfriend? - No. Just remember, she''s very resourceful. - Tim, I''m gonna find her. - [Dior] Okay, so after the cells divide, what''s that phase called? - I really don't wanna do this anymore. - But you agreed to the rules. - So if I don''t do your - You think that just because you ran away you can''t think about your future? - You''re starting to sound like my mom. - Well this isn''t it for me. I'm gonna make something of myself. - Well why don''t you so important to you? - Well that''s out of the question. But, you did agree to study - I'd rather live under the bridge than put up with all these rules. You''re starting to sound like my mom. - Then go. Go. (gentle music) You know, I think you should go home. At least you have a mom that - No, you're right, I'm sorry. I''ll keep up with my school stuff. I want to stay. - Good. Well, I''m gonna take Futt for a walk. You wanna come with? - Um no, I have some things to do. - Okay, we''ll meet back here at five? - Okay. - This is beautiful. - It was my grandfather''s.

This has historical significance. An American soldier from Who knows, it could have - 2,500 that''s as high as I can go. - All right, you''ve got yourself a deal. (upbeat music) - Wait just a second, girl. How did you find out how - I didn''t. I would''ve taken 20 bucks for it. - Then how did you figure it out? - Well, I knew he wanted to So I calculated the 1,500 - Which is what? - 4,500. It''s simple math, Emma. - But what about all - It''s all in books. Let''s go find Futtman. (door knocking) - Did you find it? - Yeah, I''ve dealt with this one before. Runaway, shoplifting, priors. Parents seem nice. She just doesn''t like authority. - Hm. - I''ve done this three times with her. Is that her? - That''s her. Saw her today at the park. - Doesn''t surprise me.

I just want my dad back. (door knocking) - Sit, Terry. So, how are you liking Tim''s old job? - It''s good, pays more. - Did you hear about Mark? - No, what happened? - We caught him stealing. - I never even trusted that guy. - He never struck me - Some guys will surprise you. - We may have to let him go. - Well, he made his own bed. - It''s unfortunate.
