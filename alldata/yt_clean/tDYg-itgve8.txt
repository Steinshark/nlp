Every day, millions of us around the world do our hair. But what should be an easy task can sometimes turn into a full on disaster. But don't worry, we've got some hair hacks to make your 'dos way more doable. Another day, another beauty routine. It may take time but getting ready for the day can be relaxing. Where did you get that dress, Vicki?! Although, your hair could use a little something. It's a bit flat, don't you think? What? I thought I was having a good hair day! Take a look for yourself. Oh no! My hair looks glued to my head! I wish it had some more volume. Lemme see that clip! It may just be the answer to my problem. Clip it in like this, then grab some hairspray. Take the clip out once you're done. Flatten it out a bit and poof! You've got voluminous tresses! What a difference a little hairspray makes! That was such a brilliant trick, Vick! Ooh! I gotta run! I wonder how big my hair can get! Oh, yea. Having long hair can be fun Until it starts getting in the way. Ugh, I can't see with all this hair! Even the old hair flip isn't working. Okay, you're staying behind my shoulders! Understood? Seriously?! UGH. That's it, you're all going up! And you'd better stay there! GAHHHH! I can at least get rid of the front strands. Make me proud, Mr. Clip. Why is this happening to me?! That's, it, I'm callin' in the big guns! I staple paper, so why not staple hair? Nope. Hey! A pencil could work! I've seen girls do this before. Wrap your hair around the pencil And keep turning before sticking it downward. There! What a relief! It's not gonna fall, right? Nice. Getting ready for the day, I see? It feels like a sauna in here! Some fresh air should help. Gah! What's with the crazy wind?! GAH! I almost got swept right out the window! You don't say... Why are you looking at me like that? Rude. WOAH! Why didn't you tell me, Bella! And I just finished doing my hair. Stupid wind. I wonder if this could help. Look at all those little bristles! First, spray the brush with hairspray. Then brush back those pesky fly-aways. The spray residue should keep them in place. I feel like a new woman! How'd you fix your hair so fast? Who knew mascara brushes were so versatile? It's Saturday, Which can only mean one thing: cleaning day! These pillows need a good fluffing. I wonder where all this dust comes from. It's Vicki! I wouldn't miss her party for the world! GAHH!!! I'm like a tornado in human form! What I wouldn't do for an on-call hairdresser. I wish I could have cute hair for the party. And I think I can make it happen. Let's get this hair party started. Oop, not too much water! Now do your magic, robe tie! Start with an elastic on one side, Then twist it into your hair on the other. Keep going down all the way to the bottom. Once that's done, Flip it up and twist it in a spiral. The hanging fabric can hold it in place. It's like two little cinnamon buns! May as well finish cleaning while it sets! Phew. This cleaning sure wipes me out. Oh! Looks like my hairs nice and dry! Let's see if the trick worked! Almost there... Without any hot tools, Bella managed to get perfect waves! Aren't they fabulous? Wait til I walk into the party like this! And don't forget about the outfit. Yes and yes! Ooh! Why is that dog wearing a dress? Woah, that's not a dog. Look at this, Bella! So, I think I and i wanna cut my hair! Woah, you wanna do it for me? I guess you can do it! I didn't know you knew how to cut hair! You know what you're doing, right? Definitely. Those are some awfully big scissors... Maybe I didn't think this through... Oh god, should I be doing this? VICKI, NO! DON'T DO IT! My hair's too beautiful, I can't. Aw, I guess we'll never know. It's too bad, you'd look cute with short hair. Let me give you a little preview! Take this bottom layer and braid it. Keep going all the way down. Then tie it with a small rubber band. Take the section you put aside, And tie it loosely with an elastic. About halfway down the hair is good. Take the braid and wrap it around the elastic. Use a bobby pin to keep it in place. Okay, maybe two for this thick hair. Tuck it underneath like this. And just like that, you have a cute bob! I'll take a pic for you so you can see. You're gonna die when you see it! Look! Woah! I can't believe you didn't even cut it! It's so pretty! I look pretty good with this 'do! I'm gonna go take this hair for a test drive. Or at least have a good selfie session! I've got a lot to do. See ya! Bye, Bella! This red lip sure makes a statement. Don't forget the liner! Hey! Why does my hair always do this? It's so annoying! Ugh! I'm ready to pull it out!! HMPH! Actually, I think I know what to do. Take the pencil and put it through here Keep twisting it along the forehead. See the pretty pattern it's making? Once you're done, hold the hair And stick a cool clip on the end. Super chic! And now it won't stick to your makeup! Fabulous!! Hey! Sorry I'm late. Wow, your hair looks cool like that! Thanks!
