Stop. OK. OK. Ouch. Stop it. I am going back with you. Let me help you. Thank you for upgrading my ticket. Excuse me? Your ticket is first-class. It was not an upgrade seat. Really? Don't you know Xu Siyu? Sorry, I don't know. What would you like to drink? Just like that. OK, Madame. Thank you. Now I know. She upgraded it by herself. It is not for free. She kept my pride for saying that to me. So I can accept it as her good will. If I were not studying in the same college with her, I thought we would not have a chance to know each other. I spent all my effort studying and got this chance to study in France. My father spent all of his money. For this, I did a lot of part-time jobs Everyday to cover my living expense. And her father is a famous investor in China investment business. It seems that she always has apartments everywhere in the world she'd been. However, she is also a girl with worry and concern as the others. Just money is the last thing she needs to worry about. Even I am not in the same class she is, but she respects me very much. She is really a well-educated and how really a good person Looks like. She makes me know that I must be making more efforts to work so I can return what she had helped me one by one in another way. Thank you. Excuse me? One more, Thanks. Excuse me? I spent several years in Europe And I have no idea about what happened in the Chinese entertaining market. I know little about it now. Are you a new actor or singer? You know? Paparazzi are everywhere following you stars. They take a ton of pictures and you would be on the headlines in the next day. I will hire bodyguards for sure. These people, are they having too much time to spend? I am sorry. Let's take a picture. Although I don't know who you are, but I can keep it as a record. When I know you later, I will show to others that I used to take a same plane with you. Come on. Please sign your name here. Thank you very much. What's wrong? I need to get off the plane. Do you know what will happen if I shout that you are kidnapping me? I know. Just do it. Great. You are great. I go back with you. Hey, how are you doing? I was drunk on the plane. I can't control myself. It make you embarrassed. I am sorry. Are you kidnapping? Do you need me to call the cops? Excuse me, Madame. This is my business card. I am the security supervisor in OU's group. My name is Jiang yilong. This is Ouyang, our vice president in our group. I just take him back home by the order from his father. Oh, I am sorry. It is a misunderstanding. Sorry. Sorry. Take your time. Too embarrassed. Hey, Zhe? I am going out from the exit. I am waiting for the luggage . You look very happy. Don't rush. Take it easy. I am already in the airport. Don't worry. Take your time. OK. See you later. Attention, passengers by No.7381 flight now are boarding.

I am dreaming about you everyday. I want to be stay with you soon. Now you are here, right? Let's go. What's going on? I want to look at you. Go. Let's go home. Siyi, I arrived. He picked me up already. Now I am in his car. Where is he? Let me have a look. Be quick. OK. Chen Zhe. I didn't see. Let me have a look again. OK. Hey, Zhe, Siyu wants to say hi to you. Hi Chen Zhe. Hi How are you? Be good to my Meiya. She is my best friend. If you are not good to her, I will come to find you. Hear me? OK. I don't bother you two. He is very shy. Just stay with me. Go. See you.

Then you just go on your meeting. See you. See you. Who is that? Just for work. I guess so. You are very handsome when you are at work. Well, what did I say? Just forget it by Siyi's call. Oh, I remember. I met a guy on the plane. Do you know Ou's Group? The cosmetic brand? I met the son of Ou's boss on the plane. He just sit next to me. You know, a lot of people surrounded him. I though he is a pop star. However when the plane landed, those bodyguards stood up and carried him to move. I though he was kidnapped and I was I was going after him and tried to help him. Finally, the head of the bodyguard gave me a business card. That was a misunderstanding. I almost called the police. I was so embarrassed. Chairman and madame are waiting for you at home. Your sister also will go home. Can I have my phone back? Sorry. I was ordered by chairman. Sumsung assistant. Call Mom. Hello, Mom. I've picked him up on the way back home. OK. Bye. Just now when you were in the Exit, did you see a girl there? She is good looking but seemed very angry. I was far away from her but I also can felt chilly. Did you feel that. No. I think she is his family. I saw them stay together. It is too scared. I though rich family has not so much worries. Well, to my surprise, every family is the same. What? Anything? I finally can have a real Zhe here. Do you need a signature from me? Tu Dou. It is fine. I am on it. OK. The chef working hard here tossing the wok, the little old man, is my father. When I was six, he adopted me in the orphanage. I suffered from CHD when I was born. I was abandoned possibly because of this disease. My father raised me up alone. And he sent me to the hospital to cure my CHD. I felt very sorry for him. Because he was unmarried till now because of me. But he said he is just waiting for the woman he loved. But till now, the woman did not come to find him. Dad. I am hungry. OK. The food is ready. I asked my father that why he chose me such a kid with heart disease and raise me alone? My father said, because at that moment, I, the little pale girl, went towards him to hold his hand. Father. Tu Dou. Serve it. OK. Ya. You are home. The beauty company my mentor recommended is Ou Group. I'm the director of the security department in Ou Group, Jiang Yilong. This is Ouyang, our vice President. Let's take a picture together. Although I don't know who you are now, I can keep it as a souvenir. When I find out who you are, I'll tell others. I've been on the same flight with you before. Hurry up. Oh my god. I'm done. Ou Group is so big. Even if I go to work, I'll stay in the lab every day. I'm not gonna see that Ouyang. Besides, he must have forgotten. He won't remember me. The interview need my graduation card. Let me help you. I'm dead. Please sign it for me. Thank you. So many... I didn't mean to read your secret but I have to make sure who you are. You'll forgive me, right? Chen Zhe, my life in France is so tough. I miss you so much. I miss you every minute of every hour. I wish I could hold you right now, coming back to you. What can I do? Zhe. Dear Zhe, what can I do? I'm going crazy. All my god. What can I do? What can I do? This is crazy. I love you with a clear and firm faith. I love you with a warm and brave force. I don't care how hurt my heart is and how other people think. Love is a king of power can take me to you. My god, so funny. She copied the lyrics. It was a terrible beating. Never have I seen a man beaten so badly. What a pity! The distance of eleven thousand seven hundred and thirty-nine hundred and seventeen kilometers can't block my feelings. Three years away from you can't reduce our twenty years' love. Zhe, I'm coming back to marry you. Wait for me. Twenty years. How old is she? Beat him! Ouyang, you are so stupid. What can I say about you? How can there be such a stupid person as you. You ask for it. So pity. I'd better stop looking this. I'd better stop. Dear friends in the WeChat moments. I took the wrong luggage on the plane with a girl today. Her name is Lin Meiya, She came back from studying in Paris to marry her boyfriend of 20 years, Chen Zhe. The age at which the girl's puppy love began, I'm curious too. Attached are three photos, whoever finds her will be greatly indebted. Genius. Father, did you see the cloth I wore yesterday? I washed it. Ya, you came back? Yes. Hi, uncle Yang and aunt Yang. Father, before you washed my cloth, did you go through my pockets? I have a business card in my pocket. Did you see that? What business card? I didn't see it. What's the matter? Nothing important. I took the wrong box with a guy named Ouyang on the plane. His bodyguard gave me a business card. I have to find him now to exchange my luggage back. You took the wrong luggage? Yes. All my important papers are in it. Why did his bodyguard give you a card? It's just a misunderstanding. Don't worry, father. Leave it to me. I can handle it myself. You lost your luggage? It's not lost. It's taken by mistake. Teacher Wang. Try it, I just mixed it. Too acid. My bad. You take this. I'll mix another for you. Li dong, pick up the dishes outside. I'll go upstairs. Okay, aunt Mei. Liu. Clean all the dishes in a minute. and put them in the disinfection cabinet for sterilization. -Remember it. No problem. You handle here, I'll go outside. Okay. Welcome. Take your time, please. Please come again. Li dong. I'm leaving. Okay, uncle Liang. You've finished? Take care. Hello, who is there? It's me. Where did you go? Why did you come back? I got all the calls from Paris. The game is about to begin. and you disappeared. Your phone is turned off too. What's the matter with you? Forget about that. This tour match, I haven't been in touch with my father for half a year, making him mad. A gang was sent to Paris to take me back. What could I do? I couldn't stand a gang chasing me all day in Paris. So hard to get rid of them. So you escaped from a gang on the streets of Paris like an action movie. I can't imagine you'll meet this. Why it's so noisy there? I can't hear you. I said why it's so noisy there. Don't forget it's Monday. I'm in Li's old restaurant. Oh, it's Monday. You're so funny. The sole heir to billions of dollars still have to work in the old restaurant serve as a servant every Monday. I have to. Don't you forget my grandfather started his business in here. Without this restaurant, is it possible to have what we have today. These are the rules set by grandfather. The old restaurant must be passed on So, no matter you are young master Li or heir to the whole group. No exception. Come in every Monday, do the dishes and serve as a waiter. The purpose is to remember our origin. Do you understand? I'm not as blessed as you are. What do you mean? Your father's company, how many times have you been there, Mr Ouyang? Don't tell me about the company. It annoys me. Who is the girl? Ex-girlfriend. Where did you find this? In the drawer. Liu, drive to home. By the way, I'm not here this time. How's the club doing? What else can the club do? The whole army was wiped out. What did I say? They can't win without me. Come on. You don't have to brag to me. When have you not been beaten? But this time, I'm glad you didn't play. You know why? So you don't have to come back black and blue, hiding in my house to recover. I have to make that up for you or your parents would think you're chasing after girls. I don't understand. Why are you so stubborn? Boxing is not a shady business. Why can't you let your family know? You're still talking about me? How about you and my sister? You two don't love each other but pretending to be together because of parents. Just make it clear to them. Aren't you tired? You always change the subject to something I don't want to discuss. Don't talk about your sister with me in the phone. It annoys me. All right, I gotta get busy. Have you had meals? Come and see me if you haven't had it. I gotta get busy for the whole day. Okay. I'll be there when I'm done. Wait for me. Sure. Ouyang. Where's the wrong taken luggage? In my room. Delete your yesterday's WeChat moment. I'll help you find the luggage. How can you help me find it? Chen Zhe is the sales manager of our company. I'll go to your room and take the box away. What a coincidence. How's you doing, manager Yuan? Why are you free to visit our sales department? Don't play a joke on me. I just want to ask you. Recently, have you been feeling really happy? Hold back from telling us to wait for some day giving us a surprise? Are you making fun of me? Didn't you always say you didn't have a girlfriend? You've been together for almost twenty years. She traveled thousands of miles back to marry you. To be honest, I envy you so much. What are you talking about? Keep pretending. Try to pretend better. You really don't know? I'll tell you that your girlfriend took the wrong luggage which was our young president Ou's when she came back. Last night, Ouyang posted a WeChat moment. A friend of mine took a screenshot and sent it to me. Take a look. Isn't that you?? What's the matter? Get on this car. What do you want again? I have to go out right now. I'm gonna drive my own car. I don't need your help. I'm sorry. The chairman gave orders. You are required to go to work every day from now. Even if you get up late, you need to work no matter when. I'm sorry. It's all the orders from the chairman. Work for the company, right? All right, I'll go right now. Get out of my way and I'll drive myself. No. The chairman gave orders. I must drive you there in person. What about my car? I have to park my car back. Don't worry. I'll let someone to deal with that. Give in? Let me go. You're good at fighting. Fighting is not something you can learn in a short time. What we practice is boy skill. I have learned these since I was a child. It's already in my head. No set moves but it's really strong, right? So the moves you do are like child's play to me. Don't show your teeth in front of me again or I'll hurt you. My moves? What do you know? Don't worry. I won't tell others. The thing that you played kick boxing, I won't tell anyone. Hello, may I help you? Hi, I'm looking for Ouyang. I mistaken his luggage on the plane. I want to change it with him. I'm sorry. Even if you do take the wrong luggage. You won't find him here either. We work here every day but we only see him once a year. That's pretty good already. What? All the important materials for my interview are in my luggage. If I can't find him, I can't go to the interview. How about this? You give me Ouyang's phone number or his bodyguard's. His bodyguard gave me a call earlier. But I'm sorry that I lost it. What's it called? I'm really sorry. The question you raised is private. We can't help you. I'm really not a liar. This box is Ouyang's, I promise. Isn't he playing kick boxing all over the world? Here's the video inside. I've seen it. It's really him. It can't be wrong. If you don't believe me, I will... What did you yell? Come with me, back to the office. It's okay, she's my friend. We're leaving. Mr Ou's friend? Is she his girlfriend? It's hard to say. You, stand aside. Why? You're in the way. What were you yelling at the front desk? Which video did you watch? I need to make sure who owns the box. You have a mess in here. I don't know what it is. So I dig it up. what have you found? I haven't figured out anything else. But I feel pity for your face. You look good and handsome. Not really ugly. But you got punched right and left and kicked from left and right. Your face is swollen like that. I really think you're crazy. Why? How old are you? Twenty-three. You've fallen in love for twenty years. That means you start dating at three. Precocious enough. You read my diary secretly. Are you Lin Meiya? I'm telling you. If you dare to leak out the video of my game. Your pictures, diary and all your secrets. I put it all on the Internet. You don't have to spend a penny on publicity. You and Chen Zhe will be famous for sure. What I don't understand is your Chen Zhe works in our company. He's the sales manager. Why don't go straight to him? Why did you yell at the front desk? What did you say? Chen Zhe works in your company, and he's the sales manager? Really, you don't even know where your boyfriend works? Aren't you falling In love for twenty years? You don't even know this? Let's change the luggage in the meantime. Come on, where's my luggage? Give it to me. I haven't seen my luggage yet. I have to check everything first. Take away your hands. Take away. Okay. You can go back Go back to where? Someone will send your luggage to you. Are you kidding me? All my valuable things are in that. How do I know if my luggage is safe with you? Come on, give me mine. Your luggage is at my house now. But I really can't give it to you right now. It doesn't matter. I don't think you're busy. I'm free today too. Come on, I'll go home with you. Really? Then you get his permission first. If you can get me out of here today, I'll follow you in the future. Mr Ou can't go anywhere today. He must work here all day. I was tied up for work. I want to get out of here more than you do. I have nothing to do with your family stuff. I don't know either. Don't tell me. I don't want to know. Call your family to send the luggage over. I'll wait here. Can you be reasonable? Didn't I already call? They didn't answer my phone. It's not convenient for them now. That is to say I can't give you the luggage now. Do you understand? How about this? Just in case, you promise me you won't let my privacy out. Let's make a video to be the evidence. You say that again to the camera. What are you doing? I dialed my number. Now you have my phone. I have your phone, too. So? Go back and wait my message. Why should I believe you? You help each other Your twenty years' boyfriend, Chen Zhe, he works in our company. I'm his boss. Due to this, you should believe me. What does it matter that you're his boss? I'm telling you this, Chen Zhe is very good. Don't think you're his boss so you can threaten me. He can quit if he's not happy. He can change jobs, do you understand? I'm going back. I'll wait for your call. Okay. Please. Bye. Who was that girl out there? Nobody. She wrong taken the luggage, come and change. Are you still eating lollipop? Throw it out. Walk me through the company. Chen Zhe. If I hadn't gotten your call today, I might not be able to keep going. The landlord kicked me out because I cooked in the house. It is pouring with rain outside. I have nowhere to go. I think I'm going to freeze to death in the foreign street. But it was then you called me. I didn't tell you my situation. But your voice gives me strength. My whole body seemed to be warmed up in an instant. Hello. Hello, I'd like to see Chen Zhe. Are you manager Chen's girlfriend Lin Meiya? Yes. Come with me and I'll show you in. Thank you. Mr. Chen's girlfriend. Mr. Chen's girlfriend. What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm in the office. Zhe. How are you? I guess you haven't eaten yet? These are your favorite foods. What are you doing here? How did you know I worked here? Why are you so nervous? No. How did you know I worked here? I'll tell you if you take one. Don't make fun of me, tell me. Try one. I didn't have time to tell you last night. Last night, I found out my luggage and Ouyang's was mistaken. I came here to change with him. He told me you worked here. When did you start to work here? I've never heard you say that to me. Besides, when I came in, I found your colleagues seem all know me. Are you keep showing them pictures of me everyday? What did they say about me? Tell me. Did they tell me I am good-looking? Do you want to know why did they know about you? Because yesterday, Ouyang posted your photo, my photo and the journals you wrote. All of them on WeChat moment. Really? Of course it's real. The whole company is laughing at us now. Let me have a look. What's the matter? You and I have nothing to hide. We'll get married sooner or later. Instead, in the way to tell your colleagues about our marriage. It's good. I'm satisfied. My father told me last night to marry you as soon as possible. Get married and go to France. I refused that. I made it very clear to him. I wouldn't go anywhere this time. He was angry. How about you and I get married first? Ya. To make him happy. Ya. I think you should go back to Europe first too. Stop. Why do you say the same thing as my father? I'm telling you again. This time I came back, I'm not going anywhere anymore. Don't you ever say that to me again Don't forget to accompany me to the north shooting range later. Take one more. The scenery here is pretty good. Xiaoya. If you're okay, go back first. I have a meeting later. Then I won't bother you. I will go back first. Do you come back for dinner tonight? The meeting will end late. You can eat first. Then I will go. Hug me. There are so many people here. They will see. Who doesn't fall in love? Hurry up. If you don't hug me, I won't go. Hurry up. Hurry up. Ok, ok, ok. Is that ok? All right now. Zhezhe. Ok, ok, ok. Remember to eat what I bought for you. Ok, ok, ok. Go now. Then I really go back. All right. Ok. Go. By the way. I forgot that there is a package of food. I bought it for your colleagues. I'll send them. No no..I.. Meiya, No, I'll just give them. OK, you go to work. I will go. Meiya, Meiya. Hello, everyone. I am Lin Meiya. I brought you something to eat today. Thank you for your usual care for Xiaozhe. I heard him say that you always work overtime. Thanks. Thanks. You are welcome. You are welcome. Sorry, I'll take a call first. Hello, dad. No, I haven't changed it yet. Ok, I see. I'll hang up. It is your turn. You're welcome. There is a little left, If you guys are hungry, eat them yourself. Our family has a food stall. My dad's fried crayfish is a specialty, it's very fragrant. One day if you get off work early, you must let Xiaozhe take you to our stalls to eat. Otherwise, I'll pack it for you. I'll go now without disturbing you. Bye. See you. Bye. Xiaozhe. See you. But then you called me and I didn't tell you my situation. But your voice gave me strength. My whole body seemed to warm up in an instant. Chen Zhe. Do you have something to explain to me? I don't think it's necessary to explain it to you. Like I said before, Lin Meiya is my ex-girlfriend. But we have broken up. The two of us grew up in an orphanage. His adoptive father treated me well. So the two of us were logically together later. But then we get older. She went to Europe. The relationship is slowly alienating. We broke up two years ago. This is true. I know. She has always been thinking about me. I don't know why. But this is her unilateral wishful thinking. Don't you understand who I like now? What's this? Just open it and see. No matter what you see inside. We broke up two years ago. Chen Zhe. I give you time. Take this diary seriously and think carefully about how to explain it to me. It happens that this Lin Meiya is not a person who only cares about how much she pays. What she records every day is that others treat her well. Wouldn't you like to tell me she's a pet drowned patient? Or do you want to tell me that the time difference between here and there has changed from six hours to two years? I admit that I have a little more concern for her. But this concern is more of a mercy, a sympathy. The two of us grew up and depended on each other. It feels like a family, a loved one. I just can't bear to be so decisive with my family. I thought she would meet other men when she went to Europe. She will stay there to work. Anyway, this is something I did wrong. I will solve it. Ok. Leave this diary for you. Her suitcase is in my car You give these two things back to her. I give you time. I believe you can handle this matter. Right? Aunt Feng. Busy now? This is little Meiya. 5 pounds each of shallots, potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, and radishes, eggplant, cauliflower, and green vegetables. Ok, all right. Aren't you going to France? Back for holiday? Yes. So great. You have grown into a slender girl. No. Your dad must be happy when you come back. You have to accompany him. I know. Where is your car? I stopped at the back door, same place. OK, I'll ask you Uncle Feng to send you. Ok. Aunt Feng, how much is the total? My dad and I have changed to monthly bills. I have a small notebook. I will checkout with your dad later. Just leave it. OK, then you can do your business, I'll look elsewhere. Ok. Do your business. Take it slow. Uncle Daxia. Look who is back. Maya, did you help your dad as soon as you came back from France? Yes. What a good girl. Uncle Daxia, how is your business? Quite good. Pretty good. It's all because of your dad. That's good. Still the same today. Understood. Four boxes of crayfish, four boxes of clams, and one box of prawns,right? Right. Today this pippi shrimp is particularly fresh. I'll send you two pounds later. Go back and respect your father. Thanks, uncle Daxia. Then I will take it. OK, I'll take it to you later. Ok, I will wait you at the door. Ok. Done. See you soon. I give you time. Take this diary seriously and think carefully about how to explain to me. It happens that this Lin Meiya is not a person who only cares about what she paid. What she records every day is how others treat her well. Senior, excuse me Can you send me the report that our leader said at the meeting today? What report? The sales report of our company last year. You are Chen Zhe, right? You are new, I don't blame you. Those reports were worked out by me. The leader wants me to send you and I have to send you? No. Are you too simple? If you want, count again. Understood? How can there be so many good things to sit and enjoy? I said that all these newcomers thought that the pie could be dropped in the sky? Gain without paying. How can there be so many good things? When did your bullying newcomer prevail? You are the sales department and you are a team. Everyone works in a team to work together. As an old employee, you don't help the new employee, but you put on the old attitude here for temporary joy, which slows down the progress of the entire team. I want to ask you who is responsible for you? The entire company. I absolutely do not allow this problem to occur in the entire company in the future. If you have any questions you can come to me. Understood? Mr. Ou, I know. I will post it right away. Mom and dad. I have found a job. Don't worry. I will work hard. Soon I will climb up and step them all under my feet. Ok, let's go. Bye. I will go. Hold him. Rebound. Go there. Good play. Stop him, stop him. Spread out, spread out. Hit hand. Is it delicious? Yes. My dad simmered for two hours. He's partial. He also told me to tell you. You must eat all the pork elbow he stewed with heart. Don't worry, I'm sure I'll eat them all. You will take the college entrance examination in half a year. Cheer up. Get a good grade, clear? I will surely work hard. Otherwise, how can I deserve you and my uncle's big elbows for the past two hours? So delicious. When those red berries come in springtime, Flushing on your southland branches, Take home an armful, for my sake, As a symbol of our love. Come on, put it on. Can you squat? Hurry up. Squat. Ok ok I squat. I squat. Squat. Do you like it? Yes. Mr. Ou is coming. The shop is so bright. President Li himself cooked. So respectful and admirable. Stop it. Didn't you tell me that you were abducted by your dad to work in the company and you couldn't get out? Let me tell you. I went with my father to visit the company all afternoon. I behave quite well-informed. He agreed to let me out and let me move freely. But I told you, I won't accompany you to do the dishes here. What about doing the dishes? Working people are the most glorious. Let me tell you. You have to come to me often, it's time to catch the popularity. Understand? Sit outside. You are busy today. What do you want to eat? Give me whatever you have. I will eat everything. How rich you are! Don't just eat, you have to pay. I will surely do. Wait. Dad. I am back. Brother Tudou, you really are a strong potato. See what about it. Welcome to Lijia Old Specialties. Pork elbow with Hung Hom Sauce. Take a try. What are you watching? Did you hear the name of the dish? What do you mean? Want to go there and taste? Leave it. Their home is messier than yours. I will never eat in such a place in my life. Let me tell you, Ouyang. Don't look down on people. Not only isn't their home dirty and messy, but the taste is one of the best in this old street. Uncle Lin has been cooking for more than a decade. He has first-class craftsmanship and is very nice. We are friendship between generations. The one in the yellow T-shirtT is his daughter. She has just returned from studying abroad. She is now helping her. But she is an orphan. She was adopted by uncle Lin. The two of them have been running this shop on this street for more than ten years. Hard for them. Do you think this girl looks so innocent and beautiful? Brother, what is your taste? My taste? Didn't you just stare there for a long time? Let me tell you. Don't think of being together with her. You can consider anyone but her. It's okay to accompany you to order crayfish. Brother. Do you think my aesthetic is the same as yours, the restaurant opened here and stayed in the old century aesthetic? Uncle and aunt Wang. Come, uncle Wang, let me do this. Come. Take it slow. Come, all right. Come, take it slow. Uncle Wang. Ok. The world is changing fast. Some old flavors and old shops will be extra precious for people. Make an analogy. If you used to eat in a restaurant when you were young. But suddenly one day you found that this shop was gone. Demolished and can't be found. You will feel particularly lonely. This loneliness seems to be suddenly abandoned by a good friend for many years. So, the old shop needs to have the old taste. Sitting in the old shop and enjoying the old taste. This is a unique sense of security. This is a sense of security that has not been abandoned in this era. So people who came to eat in our old Lijia restaurant are all old neighborhoods. I envy you. I don't even know what old taste is. For me, the old taste may be the dish made by our chef. Waiter, waiter. Fresh garlic. Ok, coming. Your garlic. I don't want this peeled I want it completed. Ok. Brother Tudou. I forgot to buy the garlic today. Xiaoya. Go to your uncle Li to borrow two. Ok. Hold on. Ok. I will do. Sorry, I'll be right back. Uncle Xiaoli. Can you lend me two garlic? It 's the kind of not peeled. See how busy your business is. You even run out of garlic. Wait, Uncle will take it for you. Ok. What? It is you! I still want to ask you. Did you follow me all the way? I followed you? I've been on this street since I was little. Have you seen? That is my restaurant. I followed you? Sorry. You two know each other? No. Meiya. The garlic you asked. God! Uncle Xiaoli! It's too much. I will just take two. Okay, put it all in. Make yourself at home with me. Just a few heads of garlic. So little money. Me and your father are friendship between generations. Since you call me Uncle Xiaoli, why are you so kind with me? I call you Uncle Xiaoli because of my dad. You really think you are my uncle? How can you have such a young uncle? Thanks. You are welcome. What's the situation? I got the wrong suitcase with this strange woman on a plane coming back from abroad. She came to my company and asked me. I wondered how I could meet her everywhere. You two still have this fate. What fate? No wonder you just stared there for a long time. Why didn't you say early? What fate? You haven't watched my moments? Uncle Xiaoli. Meiya, what happened? To thank you for borrowing garlic, I give you a bowl of crayfish. Eat whatever you want. If not enough, I will let my dad cook more. Who let you eat? Didn't you say eat whatever you want? I asked Uncle Xiaoli to eat whatever he wants. I didn't ask you. You gave uncle Xiaoli. And I am his friend. So he will surely give it to me. Right, uncle Xiaoli? Where is your safeguard? Don't you have bodyguards all the time, so you can't go home? I find that you are in charge of many things. What's the matter with my bodyguard is with me or not? This is surely none of my business. But my luggage is of my business. Since your bodyguard didn't follow you, I'll go home with you to pick up my luggage. Didn't I tell you that I'll call you when I get the luggage. Why are you in such a hurry? Stop. You'll call me when you get the luggage. So my luggage isn't with you. Then where is my luggage? Let me tell you, Ouyang. All my stuff is in that suitcase. That suitcase and the things in it are very, very important to me. If you dare to lose my suitcase, I will.. What? What do you want? Want to hit me? Come, come. Hit me, hit me here. Come. Maybe you don't know about some videos in your suitcase, but I took a backup. Don't you want everyone in the world to see some people being hit and crying? Who was crying? Let me tell you. If you dare to send the video, never want to get your suitcase in your life. Dear both.. Dear both, it is hot today. Be calm. You two both are my friends. What about giving me a face. After Ouyang eats the crayfish, shall we have a good chat? Since you are Uncle Xiaolii's friend, then I will give Uncle Xiaoli a face. But I want to ask Uncle Xiaoli for a certificate. Ouyang must return Lin Meiya's box as soon as possible. Otherwise I will upload the video. Ok. Uncle Xiao Li testified. Ouyang, Return Lin Meiya's suitcase to her as fast as possible. Ok? Meiya, Before Ouyang returns the suitcase to you, please be sure to save this video and not let it go out. Just give me a face. Ok? Ok. I trust you, uncle Xiaoli. I will wait for your call. Thanks for your crayfish. Eat it as you wish. If not enough, my dad will cook more for you. I can't eat that strange thing. The problem is did she really watch your video? The meatballs are freshly fried. Don't get cold. Eat them now. Brother Tudou. Ok. What do you want? Hello. Is your meeting finished? Let's have a dinner together. I ordered a western restaurant. Why go to western restaurant? So expensive. Come home and eat. I will let my dad cook for you. Your favorite simmered prawns, fried eggs with chives and spicy crayfish. My saliva is flowing out, Xiaoya. A bottle of beer for table 5. Ok, I will hung up. I have to work. Wait for you to come back. Are you eating happily? So great. What about I ordering two more for you? Enough. I am full. This is the soda you want. This is added. Uncle. Xiaozhe is here, hurry in. You are back. Your suitcase. My suitcase. Why is my suitcase here? This Ouyang is so unreliable. Gave you the suitcase but not me. Is he playing me? I have to check. All my information and credentials are in the suitcase. The most important thing is that my diary is also in it. The most important of all is that the suitcase was given to me by Siyu. I can't lose it. Look at her. Just like a child. Let's eat. Eat now. I leave the suitcase here. Doesn't matter. Boyfriend. The boy who just dragged the suitcase and walked by is Meiya's boyfriend. They grew up together and are both orphans. I know. Chen Zhe works in our company's sales department. They have profound love for twenty years. Chen Zhe worksin your company. And he is your employee. This is your favorite spicy crayfish. How does it taste? Thanks uncle. Uncle, come and eat. Stop cooking anymore. You eat first. I have two tables of dishes to cook. Don't wait for me. Are you hungary? What I worry about most is that you only know the meeting and don't eat well which makes your stomach suffer. But today I can watch you eat. I'm relieved. Let me tell you. These dishes were made by my dad so diligently and I stared at him. This shrimp is not tasty when it is cold. And your favorite leeks scrambled eggs. This is your favorite. Meiya. Come with me, I have something to tell you. What? Come. Dad, let me talk to Xiaozhe. We will be back soon. Ok. What are you telling me? Let's sit down and talk. What are you telling me indeed? Say it right now. Actually. I always have a feeling that is not very real when I look at you. Because other people may have changed their hair or changed their clothes in my eyes. But you are different. You look so much in my memory. How you looked when you were five. How you looked when you were seven. How you looked when you were ten. It has been twenty years, Lin Meiya. I always think I owe you a thank you. You made me upset. What are you thanking me for? Then I also want to say thank you. Thank you for being with me for twenty years. Isn't this buddy asking for marriage? Really? He's too thoughtless to propose here. Many people in our orphanage are still alone without a family. So I always thought I was lucky to meet you. I have this place after I met you. Are you tired? No. Would you like to carry me like this forever? Yes, I do. Dad. Chen Zhe said that he is willing to carry me like this forever even if I am old. Ok, all right. Come here now. Spicy crayfish comes out of the pan. Hurry! Spicy crayfish. Coming! It is exactly at this road. You have been waiting for me in the wind and rain for so many years. Wait for me to eat together. Wait for me after school and work. So I always thought I should say thank you. Thank you. Thank you for giving me this home. Thank you for choosing me as your loved one. But let's separate. Let's break up. No..no.. Not this sentence. You bought the ring for me. This is the little red bean you gave me before I went to Europe. Meiya, twenty years. You are very nice. Uncle is nice to me. This home is very warm. The dishes are very delicious. But Meiya, No matter how delicious the food is, I 'm tired of it for 20 years. I give it back to you now because I don't think I deserve it. Find someone worthwhile. Forget me. Don't you leave. So this is a break up? What happened? No, no, no. I don't want to break up with you. Meiya. You picked me up at the airport yesterday. No, no, no. I don't want to break up with you. I don't want to break up with you. Where I didn't do well, I can change. I can change. This is too much. I will take a look. What a jerk? Chen Zhe. Chen Zhe. Don't you leave. I won't let you leave. Chen Zhe. Don't you leave. Chen Zhe! Chen Zhe! Chen Zhe! Chen Zhe! Chen Zhe! Chen Zhe! Don't go! Chen Zhe! Don't go! Chen Zhe! Don't go! Chen Zhe! Chen Zhe! Mei ya, are you hurt? Get up. Are you alright? Are you hurt? Chasing a car, are you insane? Uncle Li, could you get me out of here? I don't want my dad to see what I am like now. OK. OK. I know what to do. It's OK, don't be sad. Everything is gonna be better. Don't cry. Uncle Li, can you take me to Fang Hua International Building B 1707? The one on the Fang Hua Road. My youth, all of our flaming oaths and the belief I've held on to, have all roared away in a sudden with his car when he left. At that moment, every light in the world is turned off, I've lost all my sense and perception. With no direction, no clue, no past and no future, I am left in a blank zone and become the walking dead, waiting on one site to be dried and then crushed. But there will never be my Chen Zhe coming to save me. Drink it slowly. Liar. Liar. That guy is a liar too. I said I have to go to Fang Hua International Building, but here is not! I still got a lot to say! I have to go to Fang Hua International Building, I have to tell him! Meiya, You know we've told you a white lie, don't you? Trust me, you don't want him to see you in your current condition. I want another drink. You will get drunk. I can make you a drink without alcohol. No. I want alcohol, a lot of alcohol. I'm a capable drinker. Please, uncle Li. Coming here frequently means nothing. No, it means a lot. Come on. One more time. Thanks. Let's call it a day. Uncle Li, where are we now? Welcome to my fight club. Your fight club? This is your fight club? Why can't it be mine? Jesus! I have totally no idea. More exactly, he is the boss here. But besides this place, the outside part is an integrated sport competitive club, basketball, soccer, baseball, equestrian, golf, we got everything here, just name it. Oh right, and a hotel. Holy crap. She has drunk all of this! You don't know this women will transform as long as she drinks? After you know her so many years? The point is I never drank with her. What! I hate it the most when people touch my head! And I hate it the most when people sweat a lot! This is your common training ground for taking a beating? Don't push your luck. We two just saved you! Don't say "just" with me! Moments ago, I still told my father I was snuggling up with Xiaozhe. To be honest, you really don't have to break your heart such severely for a man. It's a waste of life. You know what is life? When I was in the orphanage, I was always bullied by the boys because I was weak. It was Xiaozhe who has protected me every time when I was bullied. He always fought with others for me, and he never complained a word even he was black and blue. When we were little, still that time, I hate eating fat, so I spat it out and held it in my hand at every meal. If Xiaozhe saw, he would run toward me and took the fat away, put it in his own pocket, his pocket was always oily and our teacher has criticized him so many times for that. But he wasn't upset at all, he just smiled every time when he saw me. He would smile, do you know that? Just like a hero. And that day, the rain was heavy. Really heavy. On the way back home, my shoes were totally wet, it was Chen Zhe, Chen Zhe gave his shoes to me, so that I got a pair of dry shoes to wear. Liar. Liar! I'm going to Fang Hua International Building B! B! B! It's not Fang Hua International Building B! Don't pull me! Who is pulling me! Don't stop me! Loosen! All of you loosen me! Ouyang, come on! Come to challenge me! Challenge me! I don't believe you can beat me! Xiaozhe, I love you! I can't break up with you! Xiaozhe, Xiaozhe where are you? Xiaozhe! Chen Zhe is not like me, he didn't have a father to bring him home. But he did everything on his own since he was a kid, everything. If you love me, you will come to find me. You will know that I'm about to dying. Today, today, we broke up for a God-knows-why reason. I really, I really have no idea, he just broke up with me. But once I close my eyes, once I close my eyes, all I can think of is the good side of him. I can't survive if I break up with him. If you love me, you will come to find me. You will know that I'm about to dying. Xiaorui, Do you think your mom is pathetic now? Xiaorui, don't worry, I promise I will give you a beautiful future, but don't you follow my way in your life. Never trust those sweet nothings, and never choose a blindly greedy man as your husband in your whole life. Mom, please, I want you to live a happier life, I want you to stop wandering between the past and the reality, and stop being as drunk as a fiddler everyday. Mom, I'm begging you, be realistic, can you do that? Mom, slow down. Xiaorui, come here. Sit. Dad. Mom has met some friends tonight, so she is a little bit drunk now. I have no interest in this. I want to ask you for some information about the sales in the second-tier cities of our makeup retail chains. Dad, sister. You are all up. Ouyang, come here, come. I'm discussing some business with your sister, you should join us. Alright. I just asked your sister about the sales in second-tier cities of our makeup retail chains. Guess we have a huge loss? Dad, no one is willing to buy beauty product in a physical store now, they all buy it online, and get their package directly at home. It's very convenient. If I say, those retail chains of our business should all be shut. Then what's your opinion on online sales? Well, I think.... Dad, two years ago I've already had a proposal of shutting the retail chains in the second-tier cities, our sales department has already done detailed market surveys and come up with specific plans, but you turned down on it. And last year, I proposed this idea again and asked for a high attention on the online sales, but you rejected it again. About online sales, we've already made a detailed scheme, do you still remember? Yes. I know I've had errors on this decision. You know what, I will hand it over to you two. You two come up with a scheme of online sales together, ASAP. Alright, go to get some rest. OK. Dad, I'm going back to sleep. Goodbye, sister. Go to sleep. Dad, you know I can totally handle this by my own.... Xiaorui, I hope your brother can learn something from you, you try to help him a little bit, OK? OK. I get it. Dad, you should have rest early too. I'm going upstairs to sleep. You are awake. Uncle Li, I'm in your home? We are in a hotel. You got drunk last night, nobody was able to wake you up, so we could only bring you here. But you don't have to worry, I slept at next room last night. Guess you are hungry. You got ten minutes for washing yourself, I will be downstairs. Yeah. Liar. Liar! It's not Fang Hua International Building! One more time! I don't want to break up with you.
