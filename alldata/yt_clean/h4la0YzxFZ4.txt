Were warnings being heeded? (Skype tone playing) Among my first calls was to Dr. Dr. Ho. A renowned American medical who I met years back on the AIDS epidemic. You don't look too worse for &gt;&gt; (chuckles): I'm just putting (chuckles) &gt;&gt; SMITH: Dr. Ho had worked to of SARS in 2003. Now he was worried about the Do you think people are grasping how serious this situation is? &gt;&gt; I, I think people hear the They watch the coverage. But it's hard to fully Certainly, we did not realize would be so ill-prepared. We knew long ago what China was I think it, the, there was a that that's somebody else's It would not happen to us. But that, that's the same kind that people had about many other We, we knew, it would just continue &gt;&gt; SMITH: Wuhan, a major The first case was identified (siren blaring) No one knew what it was. But just a few weeks later, it Amy Qin reported from China for &gt;&gt; In December, there were that were trickling into these with this pneumonia that doctors It was unclear how to treat They were giving them medicine and they were still running And the rumor was that this that people need to be aware of. &gt;&gt; SMITH: Throughout December, to come into Wuhan hospitals Then, on December 30, a at Wuhan Central Hospital, logged on to a group chat with classmates. He was worried. Have you seen the record of what &gt;&gt; Yes. It really wasn't that outrageous just simply said that, &quot;I heard there are cases of SARS-like &gt;&gt; SMITH: Liu Baifang Schell and are longtime China experts. And that was enough to bring the &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The Public Security Bureau and made him sign a confession, and made him agree to, to be And that's a very threatening because the Public Security It's a secret police force, &gt;&gt; In China, there's an entire in which they can monitor what's in this case, they would've been to track what people were And actually, local authorities, to look into the personal &gt;&gt; SMITH: Local Wuhan a formal directive ordering not to discuss the mysterious (reporters speaking Chinese): &gt;&gt; SMITH: Despite the silencing Chinese scientists were working &gt;&gt; COVID-19 was very quickly people discerned that it was to the SARS coronavirus. But given the speed it should have been apparent to human-to-human transmission. &gt;&gt; SMITH: It surprises me to see the World Health Organization &quot;There is no clear evidence of &gt;&gt; They certainly said that, they weren't on the ground. They were probably recounting by the China CDC. &gt;&gt; SMITH: Shouldn't they have &gt;&gt; Well, they should have been This was obviously an epidemic &gt;&gt; SMITH: But with Lunar New no one wanted to spoil the &gt;&gt; (speaking Chinese): (man speaking Chinese): &gt;&gt; (speaking Chinese): (people talking in background) &gt;&gt; Chinese New Year every year This is the time when everyone with their families and in their and in one neighborhood in called Baibuting, they had at which 40,000 families ended &gt;&gt; If you have a big you don't want to have bad news. And the same holds for the If you bring up bad news during it is said that you'll be cursed for the rest of the year. &gt;&gt; SMITH: Making matters worse, millions of people left Wuhan in and family across the country &gt;&gt; (speaking Chinese): &gt;&gt; (speaking Chinese): &gt;&gt; SMITH: It was not until that the Chinese Health Ministry what was already obvious. The virus was spreading from &gt;&gt; Some ominous developments out Officials there have just the first human-to-human It's a huge story... &gt;&gt; The W.H.O. did not announce the prospect of human-to-human almost two months after this And it was two weeks after that there was human-to-human &gt;&gt; Wuhan, China, ground zero for now under lockdown. &gt;&gt; SMITH: By January 23, &gt;&gt; All trains and planes out of &gt;&gt; Eerie for a city 11 million &gt;&gt; SMITH: It was then that to take notice. &gt;&gt; I perfectly remember the this issue, and it was when we building a new hospital in just &gt;&gt; SMITH: Dr. Stefano Fagiuoli of medicine at a hospital in &gt;&gt; It's in a place far away So it was all TV show. But then, I remember I was with some colleagues, and I &quot;but if they are building &quot;there must be something beyond And I said, &quot;I think we need to &gt;&gt; Two new coronavirus cases in Singapore. &gt;&gt; (speaking Italian): &gt;&gt; SMITH: In fact, by early cases began showing up in other including the U.S. &gt;&gt; ...about the deadly hitting the U.S.... &gt;&gt; A ninth person has tested &gt;&gt; This is now the third case fourth case in Canada... (voices overlapping) &gt;&gt; SMITH: Meanwhile, Dr. Li the Wuhan doctor who had warned at the end of December, had been a week after he was ordered to (device beeping) By late January, struggling to breathe. By February 7, he was dead. &gt;&gt; His death was really a shock. And at that time, that was the with the epidemic. And his death really put a human &gt;&gt; SMITH: When news of Dr. Li's Chinese social media exploded &gt;&gt; He, he told people truth at &gt;&gt; SMITH: It got the attention an 83-year-old highly respected a top adviser to the government. &gt;&gt; And then he passed away. &gt;&gt; SMITH: He now dared to defy &gt;&gt; I think the majority he is the hero of China. &gt;&gt; SMITH: That seemed unusual to hear somebody that is an to criticize the government. &gt;&gt; Well, Dr. Zhong Nanshan, I the reason why he has so much is because he's willing to push and criticize the government I think he was speaking, just saying what most people &gt;&gt; This is Chinese doctor. I suppose majority of Chinese (blowing whistles) &gt;&gt; Everyone would go out onto and turn the lights off and hold (whistles blowing) It was really incredible to see. &gt;&gt; SMITH: A month earlier, the in Florida. They hosted a big party at their &gt;&gt; Tonight, a new year, and an &gt;&gt; Family members, and hundreds of members of &gt;&gt; Our country has never done than it's doing right now. We have the best unemployment we have the best employment Almost 160 million people Our country is really the talk Everybody's talking about it. Thank you very much. (&quot;Hail to the Chief&quot; playing) &gt;&gt; SMITH: But that weekend, the director of the Centers for Dr. Robert Redfield, from the American CDC office &gt;&gt; I was actually on a vacation and my 11 grandchildren up in and I did get notified from our on New Year's Eve that of a unspecified pneumonia in that seemed to be linked &gt;&gt; SMITH: The call was one of that interrupted his vacation. &gt;&gt; And if you talk to my wife, she said I spent most of the &gt;&gt; SMITH: On January 3, his Chinese counterpart, &gt;&gt; It got to the point that even breaks down crying during that he has with him. &gt;&gt; SMITH: Michael Shear is a for the &quot;New York Times.&quot; &gt;&gt; Uh, which underscores for, the seriousness of what the that they're dealing with. The memory of those previous SARS and another one called they really ravaged So I think what you can, what is a, is a bit of the anxiety on there in China, thinking to &quot;Geez, what if this What if it's worse?&quot; &gt;&gt; SMITH: Shear stands by his but Redfield told me that Gao &gt;&gt; He felt pretty confident that of human-to-human transmission, and that really was the extent &gt;&gt; SMITH: So he wasn't very If there was no human-to-human then he wasn't very concerned &gt;&gt; Back in January 3rd time 3rd through 6th time frame-- um, there was not a sense of &gt;&gt; SMITH: But Redfield was Alex Azar, secretary of Health He also notified the National at the White House. The president had already begun from the U.S. intelligence Some contained warnings of a with dire economic &gt;&gt; They call it the PDB, the And the virus begins to pop up you know, this could be and we should keep an eye on it. &gt;&gt; SMITH: You say we know that he doesn't always &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; SMITH: So what do we know When did the president know? &gt;&gt; That's a good question about he might have actually read it. He's never been clear any of the and I think our reporting it's, it's not clear at all that &gt;&gt; SMITH: And the president now &gt;&gt; I mean, I got impeached. I think, you know, I certainly to thinking about it, right? &gt;&gt; SMITH: And busy securing a &gt;&gt; A rare moment of after more than two years of &gt;&gt; SMITH: During this period, the president, Instead, over two weeks passed from Mar-a-Lago on a Saturday. And the president wanted to &gt;&gt; The president was not reached by Secretary Azar And the president's first to talk about e-cigarettes. &gt;&gt; SMITH: Stephen Morrison is a who has long warned that America for a pandemic like this one. &gt;&gt; And Secretary Azar conveying the gravity of the &gt;&gt; SMITH: This is 18 days after has recognized that they are and it takes 18 days for Azar &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; SMITH: Was that the first true briefing on this? &gt;&gt; As far as I know, it was the high-level discussion. &gt;&gt; SMITH: But it is unclear how the president. He declined to be interviewed. According to Michael Shear, Azar that he didn't need to worry. &gt;&gt; What Azar wanted to was, &quot;We got this. We're not, we're not taking this CDC is on it, FDA is on it. We're monitoring it closely.&quot; But also not, like, &quot;We all have and shut the country down.&quot; I mean, at this point, it's everybody is in the mode of, &quot;We gotta keep an eye on this.&quot; &gt;&gt; Are there worries about a &gt;&gt; No, not at all. And we have it under control. It's, uh, gonna be just fine. &gt;&gt; SMITH: As late as January 26, the nation's top infectious downplayed the dangers. &gt;&gt; The American people should or frightened by this. It's a very, very low risk to because we have ways of screening of people But it's something that we, need to take very seriously. &gt;&gt; SMITH: A prominent Nicholas Jewell, had been for over a month. &gt;&gt; There was still a remarkable in the Western world. That this was actually almost their shores, and that it was potentially catastrophic unless So there's no question in my that we had gained from the coming out of China. &gt;&gt; SMITH: On January 29, White House economic adviser a lengthy memo warning there was He urged flights from China The next day, Secretary Azar with the president. This time, He warned the president that might become a serious pandemic. &gt;&gt; The virus has been spread &gt;&gt; SMITH: The president some flights from China, And millions of people had And many of those people were to the rest of the world. &gt;&gt; Yes, in fact, there are to many cities in the U.S. And that was happening until the lockdown. &gt;&gt; SMITH: So those are extremely &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; SMITH: In fact, in the month decision to restrict flights, an the U.S. from China. Even afterwards, if you were an And flights from Europe for another six weeks. Furthermore, asymptomatic &gt;&gt; One of the things that they even if a person isn't doesn't have a fever, maybe that person is still all over the place and they're just not showing &gt;&gt; SMITH: The virus could spread Restricting flights proved to be &gt;&gt; Those of us who study viruses in waves here in the U.S. We had lost six weeks sitting on struggle, and watching other thinking that if we shut our we'll, we'll be fine. &gt;&gt; SMITH: Jeremy Konyndyk, a in global health issues, remembers meeting with some officials around this time. In, um, February, you sat down with some administration &gt;&gt; So, it was an off-the-record so I can't say too much but it was very clear that most that the administration was enforcing the, the travel tracking people who had come quarantining people-- that was the, the ball that they &gt;&gt; SMITH: What's wrong with &gt;&gt; Well, what... I was, I was because, to my mind, the biggest was not preventing it from because it was inevitable that You know, it's fine to try and but you have to do so with the you're buying time. &gt;&gt; SMITH: The problem was that to understand the basic math &gt;&gt; If I tell you there's 30 that's not going to scare you. That's not going to cause you to If I tell you there're 60 cases you still feel very comfortable. 120, 240, and so on. You don't feel the power of until it's absolutely stunning. So when you say, in the United States, then we the trouble is, in two or three Within another two or three So it takes a long time to ramp but once it gets your attention, &gt;&gt; SMITH: In New York City, an with New York-Presbyterian he suspected of being COVID-19 &gt;&gt; We started to hear that there that we were not able to I started hearing conversations, suggestions from a lot of the that maybe we were seeing early &gt;&gt; SMITH: During this time, the everything's under control. People that want to get a test that this is going to disappear How did you take that in at the &gt;&gt; You know, it was tough, as clinicians, when you get the you're waiting for the ability But most of the response was, Until we see a large number of we don't want to overrespond. We don't want to be, you know, &gt;&gt; SMITH: In fact, there were a little bit out there. They said, &quot;What's wrong with &gt;&gt; Well, that was, uh, that was to one of the, um, other in the area, and I said, start communicating and Um, and yeah, his response to &quot;What's wrong &quot;Why, why is he, like, getting &gt;&gt; SMITH: Dr. Griffin was not Many doctors and scientists were that America was not prepared. Among the first countries the coronavirus was South Korea. Their response is in how to handle an outbreak. Back in 2015, the Middle East or MERS, had scared them. I spoke to South Korea's foreign &gt;&gt; The lessons from the MERS uh, was, was instrumental. I think that failure had the &gt;&gt; SMITH: Officials called an With just four known cases of in the whole country, health 20 private companies on January inside Seoul's central train &gt;&gt; The train station in Seoul is It's a multifunction complex. And so, if you want to bring in from all across the country and this would be the ideal place. &gt;&gt; SMITH: Dr. Yi Hyuk-min and headed the initiative. &gt;&gt; SMITH: The meeting, the &gt;&gt; Yeah-- yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; SMITH: It was tense because how contagious the virus was and &gt;&gt; SMITH: Based on their the number of infected people every few days. In a matter of weeks, South at over 100,000 cases. Moving fast, just days after four companies had developed Just over a week later, one was By February 7, 46 labs across began to test people. A process that ordinarily could in just over a week. There were only four cases when and, and call to action. &gt;&gt; That's right. And, you know, they recognized and even if all you have that is a dangerous moment. &gt;&gt; SMITH: They tested around &gt;&gt; They then swung into action and set up this enormous along with very robust tools for and tracing contacts and and quarantining people based on They began acting before it they needed to do so. &gt;&gt; SMITH: Former head of was astounded by what &gt;&gt; They have just deployed of community health personnel on, on people going in and out who are wiping down public who are making drive-through very broadly by doing swab and and mailing it in to a laboratory construct, where, uh, and reference labs the data quickly. &gt;&gt; SMITH: They thought &gt;&gt; South Korea appears to be &gt;&gt; South Korea has done better of the other countries around &gt;&gt; SMITH: They had found &gt;&gt; The lowest number of new &gt;&gt; A leader in the global fight &gt;&gt; Something they're doing is &gt;&gt; SMITH: Then, on February 18, a 61-year-old woman in Daegu, At the time, they had discovered but when they traced her The Shincheonji Church, over 200,000 members who believe this man, is the messiah. (audience cheering) Officials knew they had a big &gt;&gt; It became obvious that this and then we decided to trace and this is about 9,000, &gt;&gt; SMITH: So, you tested 9,000 &gt;&gt; Not all of them, but we that they were traceable, asked The percentage of positives than any other groups. &gt;&gt; SMITH: Health officials of church members were positive, Dozens would die. Today, South Korea, along with has managed to control the better than most countries. In Seoul, a crowded city there have been just four known In the country of South Korea, &gt;&gt; It would be 260... 264. &gt;&gt; SMITH: The number has now By mid-January, developing &gt;&gt; Good morning, everyone. &gt;&gt; SMITH: On January 28, they were ready to go. &gt;&gt; This is really a historic Within one week, the CDC had invented a rapid Within weeks... &gt;&gt; Right out of the gate, I was about the process. &gt;&gt; SMITH: Scott Becker is of the Association of Public &gt;&gt; We were gonna be able to to a good extent for the and early detection that was &gt;&gt; SMITH: But that optimism by the end of the first week in &gt;&gt; It was Sunday morning, February 8. I woke up a little bit late. I read my texts and my emails, and I start seeing these (email alerts ringing) &quot;We're having a problem.&quot; &quot;Is anyone else seeing this?&quot; I call that an &quot;OSM,&quot; it was my And I remember thinking, &quot;Oh, my and others find out about this. We're all counting on getting and what a nightmare this is (telephone ringing) So, it was pretty devastating to the CDC staff to public health the public health community. You know, we were left without &gt;&gt; Government officials in a CDC lab in Atlanta... &gt;&gt; SMITH: By then, a diagnostic by German scientists was from the W.H.O. But U.S. officials would insist to find an American solution. &gt;&gt; Any of these groups can through our regulatory but without that we are not going to accept tests that have not been studied &gt;&gt; Good answer, &gt;&gt; SMITH: Is that excusable, that they failed to have a test &gt;&gt; That's inexcusable, I mean, how can you distribute to monitor the epidemic, and We cannot distribute drugs We cannot distribute other in that fashion. So that's certainly inexcusable, uh, for a good month, &gt;&gt; SMITH: Is it unusual to have &gt;&gt; I have not seen another The tests have rolled out very without a glitch in the past. &gt;&gt; SMITH: Tom Frieden was head during the Obama administration. Is there any bigger misstep or than the failure to test? &gt;&gt; I think, when we look back and what went wrong, we're going What should have gotten done in &gt;&gt; So my first question to you is, uh, does the CDC's test for &gt;&gt; Yeah, uh, the problem was in, to the states, had a contaminant in it. &gt;&gt; SMITH: I asked Dr. Redfield where the U.S. failed. &gt;&gt; Korea had already developed through the MERS thing, and appropriately, and that's what over the last 30 years. So, you won't get an argument that the public health workforce underinvested in for decades. &gt;&gt; The CDC now says it's now to the labs facing problems. &gt;&gt; SMITH: Weeks were lost while remanufactured the tests. If the failure at the CDC and and South Korea did not instill the February outbreak in Iran This is Qom, a place of from all over the world, It was here that the world's of the virus erupted. From the beginning, Iran's played down the dangers. A mixture of religion and had delayed Iran's response. Iran would soon be reporting the &gt;&gt; We never thought Iran would hit, uh, by the pandemic. But for whatever reason, or because of other reasons, we were one of the first &gt;&gt; SMITH: I was able to reach Javad Zarif, in Tehran. It was 6:00 in the morning Why do you think you were so What, what are the theories now? &gt;&gt; Well, nobody knows. I mean, uh, it was at a time the population was unprepared. &gt;&gt; SMITH: In fact, it was with a virus from China. It is not only that Chinese Iran faces tough U.S. economic China has become Iran's lifeline &gt;&gt; (laughing) (cameras clicking) &gt;&gt; SMITH: Kamiar Alaei is an living in exile in the U.S. &gt;&gt; SMITH: The flights were on Mahan Air. But Zarif told me that Iran at the same time as America did. &gt;&gt; I think we were one of the and to screen passengers. &gt;&gt; SMITH: The Americans cut at the end of January. &gt;&gt; My information is that our basically in the same time zone &gt;&gt; SMITH: Yet one analysis of that Mahan Air flew over 55 to and from China between They flew on to Iraq, Lebanon, and other countries. All the while, Iran's supreme would continue to downplay At one point, he said it was &gt;&gt; (speaking Farsi): &gt;&gt; SMITH: Do you agree that the coronavirus was perhaps by the United States upon Iran? &gt;&gt; Well, there are a lot of about this, I said it's not (siren wailing) (people talking in background) &gt;&gt; SMITH: Talk of a biological (machinery beeping) Tehran's hospitals were On social media, people were &gt;&gt; (man speaking Farsi): &gt;&gt; (speaking Farsi) &gt;&gt; SMITH: The government also of parliament. At least 23 senior government Reportedly, around a dozen Iraj Harirchi, appeared at this press while denying he had the &gt;&gt; He said, &quot;No, this is just, It's not a serious thing.&quot; &gt;&gt; SMITH: The next day, however, and was hospitalized. Many of Iran's faithful the seriousness &gt;&gt; (speaking Farsi): &gt;&gt; SMITH: It wasn't until March Qom's shrines. (crowd shouting, clamoring) &gt;&gt; (speaking Farsi): (men shouting) &gt;&gt; It took some time for us to We have a very traditional with people who still do not &gt;&gt; SMITH: By then, government social distancing and But it was too late. Today, Iran has reported over and 9,000 deaths. (horn honks) (people talking in background) &gt;&gt; SMITH: Coronavirus should The world has seen an increasing in recent years. &gt;&gt; ...official tells us that more fatalities than have been &gt;&gt; SMITH: In 2014, the deadly was a big wake-up call. &gt;&gt; This is an epidemic of &gt;&gt; SMITH: Jeremy Konyndyk led to fight it. &gt;&gt; It was a monumental effort under control. I think all of us who were looked back at that and said, &quot;Wow, a truly airborne or pandemic is going and so much more difficult.&quot; And so there was a real urgency of the Obama administration to for that kind of a scenario. &gt;&gt; SMITH: To address potential Obama White House organized a inside the National Security &gt;&gt; We have to put in place so that if and when a new strain crops up, five years from now we've made the investment. &gt;&gt; SMITH: But in 2018, after to head the NSC, the pandemic was reorganized. Its members were reassigned. Its leader, Bolton has maintained that he bloated NSC operations, and that it did not hurt But last year, Stephen Morrison to address America's pandemic His report, recommended the pandemic to the White House. &gt;&gt; We live in an era in which and increasing velocity and of these new pathogens This is the condition of our &gt;&gt; A SARS-like virus has now &gt;&gt; More than 10,000 people died &gt;&gt; The idea that you would at the White House, of the last two decades, which that we needed to be prepared, on a consistent and sustained &gt;&gt; SMITH: What's the explanation &gt;&gt; Well, I can't speak I presume that they wanted to moved over, out of the White and to those who worked &gt;&gt; SMITH: So what's wrong with to move this capacity over to &gt;&gt; The mistake there is to is able to see the full picture the different elements of our in a coordinated and coherent Um, that can only happen, uh, at the White House. So, by definition, we set for a slow and sluggish A slow, sluggish, &gt;&gt; SMITH: The virus was about to &gt;&gt; (chanting, singing) &gt;&gt; SMITH: On February 19, a was set to kick off in Italy's Capacity: 75,000. (crowd singing, cheering) &gt;&gt; (yelling) &gt;&gt; SMITH: The Atalanta team from won the game. &gt;&gt; Atalanta had made it (crowd cheering) &gt;&gt; SMITH: Afterwards, Bergamo of Italy's outbreak. (crowd cheering, clamoring) &gt;&gt; SMITH: Dr. Stefano Fagiuoli &gt;&gt; I had ten colleagues which went to see the game, they all got infected. &gt;&gt; SMITH: Oh, my God. When I spoke to Dr. Fagiuoli, he was quarantined at home after &gt;&gt; It's interesting that the two are close to Madrid and which was the other, &gt;&gt; SMITH: In the beginning, was slow to react. Dr. Marco Vergano is an &gt;&gt; We, we were conducting a normal life, a social life in And it is really difficult to measures when you don't have overwhelmed by patients. (siren wailing) &gt;&gt; SMITH: But they were losing Flights were cut from China, Italy hesitated to do more. The job was left up to town &gt;&gt; (speaking Italian): &gt;&gt; (speaking Italian): &gt;&gt; (speaking Italian): &gt;&gt; They became viral People, I think, uh, realized that, uh, this was a way and protect others. (man speaking Italian): &gt;&gt; Probably this happened maybe than, uh, than was necessary. Because what, what we know is some real stringent social at the beginning of the surge, and since this is an exponential just maybe 24 or 48 hours to avoid more than 30% or 40% of infected people (piano playing) &gt;&gt; SMITH: The closing of flights had done little to stem In January, the government of a new initiative to increase Two Chinese tourists from Wuhan They tested positive The virus was already here. &gt;&gt; Italy's surge in cases now coronavirus outbreak outside &gt;&gt; With the death toll leaping &gt;&gt; Italy is the hardest-hit with more than 7,300 &gt;&gt; SMITH: Was there a moment in your attention? &gt;&gt; In, in my case, personally, it was that Skype call from the from this friend of mine. He told me, &quot;I have seen scenes that I will never forget He described the hospitals with, and people dying outside of because even there were not or ambulances were in a queue &gt;&gt; SMITH: Hospitals in Italy's There were not enough beds, &gt;&gt; In, in a condition with a and maybe you have ten people in and, and only one or two &gt;&gt; SMITH: And they need to be that have a greater chance of &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; SMITH: The government did not until March 9. (people talking in background) &gt;&gt; SMITH: To date, over 34,000 Seeing what was happening top American public health increasingly convinced that from China was not enough. &gt;&gt; I think most health officials and as the secretary says, &gt;&gt; SMITH: Dr. Fauci and two to confront the president on &gt;&gt; A broad pandemic throughout travel restrictions are not You can't just travel-restrict &gt;&gt; The public health officials, at the N.I.H., they had all decided that was they were gonna tell the we need to, we need to be more &gt;&gt; SMITH: But before they could Dr. Nancy Messonnier, spoke out publicly. &gt;&gt; Tonight, the CDC is calling a &quot;tremendous health threat.&quot; &gt;&gt; We are working to ready our to respond to local cases, this outbreak could become &gt;&gt; SMITH: It was a dire warning. &gt;&gt; The virus has killed more and infected infected nearly &gt;&gt; SMITH: The president was on &gt;&gt; Thank you, Mr. President. &gt;&gt; SMITH: There, he was &gt;&gt; You may ask about the, uh, which is, uh, very well under We, uh, have very few people &gt;&gt; SMITH: But as he prepared to Messonnier spoke &gt;&gt; Ultimately, we expect we will in this country. It's not so much a question of but rather more a question of and how many people will have severe illness. &gt;&gt; Federal health officials said will certainly begin &gt;&gt; It is not a question of &quot;if,&quot; &gt;&gt; As Nancy Messonnier is giving the president is just getting on in India to fly home. So, as he's flying home, a thousand points. &gt;&gt; Wall Street continues to sell the Dow falling close to 900 &gt;&gt; TV is broadcasting nonstop the way Americans live, the president hadn't been So, by the time Air Force One Wednesday morning on the 26th, He's angry. The big economic success that he's constantly touting is from his viewpoint. He picks up the phone and calls &quot;You're scaring people to death What's going on?&quot; But the, but the big consequence of, of that is that the briefing that the public health officials that evening after he had that briefing never happens. &gt;&gt; SMITH: Angry with his public Trump refused to meet with them. Talk of more aggressive such as stay-at-home orders and was put off. Messonnier's warnings were &gt;&gt; They then, the next day, dedicated an entire presidential to walking back the, the warning that she had given. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; And with the benefit of a she was 100% right. She accurately anticipated what She tried to warn the country of And, uh, the White House tried &gt;&gt; Mr. President, that they believe it's will spread and it's not a question of &quot;if&quot; Do you agree with that &gt;&gt; Well, I don't think it's It probably will, it could be at a very or it could be at a, Whatever happens, We have the best people in the &gt;&gt; As someone who served in that kind of behavior sends a to government workers and is not permissible to say. &gt;&gt; SMITH: It's interesting that what happened in China in late &gt;&gt; The parallels are very, I think it's immensely in this administration to be for that kind of behavior, even as they have engaged in it &gt;&gt; SMITH: Dr. Nancy Messonnier Alex Azar was removed as head of He was replaced &gt;&gt; Mike is gonna be in charge, but he's got a certain talent Mike Pence to say a few words, &gt;&gt; SMITH: What talent Vice was not clear. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Mr. President. &gt;&gt; SMITH: When he was governor he had slashed the state's As a staunch evangelical he had questioned &gt;&gt; So you don't feel like you're &gt;&gt; Not in the least, I'm, I... &gt;&gt; When the, when this was I said I was delighted that I helping in this way-- &gt;&gt; SMITH: The daily press for the president's positive &gt;&gt; You are hearing the line that is low, which comes from from the president on down. &gt;&gt; How should Americans prepare Should they go on with their change their routine? What should, &gt;&gt; Well, I hope they don't Anthony, I'll let you, uh, I'll If you want to answer... &gt;&gt; Sure, Mr. President. I think it's really important the risk at this time is low. The American public needs to go &gt;&gt; SMITH: You said, February 29, The American public needs to go &gt;&gt; It was true at that time, I think the risk was low. &gt;&gt; SMITH: But by this time, Iran was in the midst of a major And you're saying, &quot;At this &gt;&gt; Yeah, well, the risk was low to the general American public &gt;&gt; SMITH: But the fact is that to test adequately, to test to know where things were going. How can you say that when we had &gt;&gt; Well, the purpose, I'm sure, is to help identify lessons and so we don't repeat this. Many of us are in the arena, where, as Teddy Roosevelt would Uh, we're trying to dare Hopefully, at best, we'll know and, you know, at worst, (crowd cheering) &gt;&gt; SMITH: Throughout February, to hold his rallies. &gt;&gt; Hello, Phoenix. Hello, Las Vegas. Great to be with you. Where else would you like to be (crowd cheering) &gt;&gt; SMITH: He blamed others for &gt;&gt; Now the Democrats are You know that, right? They're politicizing it. And this is their new hoax. &gt;&gt; SMITH: The president would for another two-and-a-half &gt;&gt; We have leaders throughout saying that this is a hoax. &gt;&gt; 35,000 people on average die Did anyone know that? And so far, we have lost nobody in the United States. &gt;&gt; It's a complete denial and leading to all sorts of that are harmful to our country, &gt;&gt; SMITH: You're quoting the He made these comments. Is it your view that he knew or was he simply misinformed? &gt;&gt; I cannot psychoanalyze the but we know that he, he has a he's the best at everything. And he probably thinks he's &gt;&gt; And you wonder, the press is and their camera just went off. (crowd jeering) The camera. &gt;&gt; I think if he were practicing he would be negligent, and he &gt;&gt; The president's behavior, the president's resort to is a function of the way he is He's approaching this crisis his own political survivability &gt;&gt; Uh, this is a list of, uh, United States is rated number &gt;&gt; I would equate it to a hurricane offshore that has of Caribbean islands and is as it heads for Florida, and not to get off the beach and board And only starting to do that coming ashore, by which point, &gt;&gt; SMITH: The first COVID-19 in America was on February 29, It was followed by a cluster of But the big bomb would land From the suburb of New Rochelle, an estate lawyer commuted daily in to his office in midtown In late February, he started On February 27, a New York Presbyterian hospital Lawrence Garbuz tested positive &gt;&gt; The man in his 50s lives in but works in Manhattan. &gt;&gt; New York City Health he is in severe condition. Now, the entire family in &gt;&gt; SMITH: For Dr. Griffin, who with COVID-like symptoms the Garbuz case confirmed what &gt;&gt; This gentleman had not so he had obviously acquired it &gt;&gt; SMITH: for more testing for weeks. &gt;&gt; SMITH: But because of a lack he says the CDC told him he Garbuz's immediate contacts. &gt;&gt; Bye. So, our impression at this beginning of March, community transmission of But you're only letting us test with this man. We don't think he got it We suspect he got it commuting We would like to start testing with respiratory symptoms that &gt;&gt; SMITH: What's their response? &gt;&gt; We still have our rigid Um, unless someone is really they need to have a direct &gt;&gt; SMITH: And what's your &gt;&gt; Our response is we think this in the community. We think there's community and we would like to do &gt;&gt; SMITH: But you're not allowed &gt;&gt; We're not allowed to. &gt;&gt; SMITH: Jessica Caro is a at a New York Presbyterian &gt;&gt; We first heard the news of getting sick, and that scared like, maybe a ten-minute drive &gt;&gt; SMITH: Her 16-year-old was the first one in her family &gt;&gt; She was complaining to me And, you know, nurse mom was some Motrin and saying, &quot;You'll be fine. And I finally got a thermometer I almost dropped it 'cause it Not 100.5, it was 105. &gt;&gt; SMITH: Wanting to get her Jessica called New York's &gt;&gt; Thank you for calling the New &gt;&gt; SMITH: Eventually, she got a but it didn't help. &gt;&gt; This man was like, &quot;Has your I'm like, &quot;No.&quot; He's like, &quot;Well, has she had with somebody that's positive?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Well, we don't know.&quot; And the last question was, And I'm like, but she's very sick.&quot; And the man tells me, &quot;Well, if she doesn't qualify.&quot; I remember hanging up the phone, I could feel the heat coming off &gt;&gt; SMITH: There was a shortage across America. Dr. Susan Butler-Wu runs a in Los Angeles. &gt;&gt; Testing was very restricted. You have to get approval from your local public health to be able to do that testing. And they then have to coordinate to get approval to do the So it was a very arduous &gt;&gt; SMITH: Because of shortages, the CDC limited who qualified &gt;&gt; At one point, the testing was coming in from mainland China. But viruses don't respect They don't respect anything like and so I think we were always It wasn't probably until later that I really started if the public health labs were it's just not sufficient. We're not gonna be able to of this magnitude. (birds chirping) &gt;&gt; SMITH: I've talked to a and they say, &quot;Look, if I that my patient had been to they couldn't get a test.&quot; &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a decision by each health department, I will say that early on, the cases that were recognized were largely linked and so those were the case as this new epidemic happened. &gt;&gt; SMITH: By early March, the to get tests. But shortages persisted, &gt;&gt; Reports that Kevin Durant has for the coronavirus. &gt;&gt; On social media, criticism who've been tested, like Celine and reportedly Kris Jenner. &gt;&gt; Whatever it may be, &gt;&gt; How are non-symptomatic getting tests while others are &gt;&gt; SMITH: We see stars being where people without means or are unable to get tested. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Unfortunately, a lot of in our society But I think that people get a when it's actually affecting their loved ones, their children you know, you're concerned about She can't get tested, And I think that during a there's something quite wrong &gt;&gt; Our response is among the Certainly among &gt;&gt; SMITH: By the end of the there were 337 cases of COVID-19 But cases were doubling every and only around 4,000 people When the president visited he flatly denied &gt;&gt; Anybody right now and anybody that needs a test They're there; and the tests are beautiful. &gt;&gt; SMITH: You know, March 6 is where the president came He's wearing the hat, and he states that everyone who Did he believe that do you &gt;&gt; Again, I don't-- on what I think the president &gt;&gt; SMITH: Did you talk to him? Did you say to him, &quot;Look Mr. it's not true what you're &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not gonna comment with the president. &gt;&gt; If there's a doctor that if there's somebody coming off they're all set, they have... &gt;&gt; I remember watching that and to test patients in my hospital than what I'm doing. And I know I can't to that So at the time, it didn't of what I was experiencing as in a hospital. Not at all. &gt;&gt; And the tests are all Like the letter was perfect, &gt;&gt; It was a made-for-TV event, But the reality of the situation and I think most Americans knew &gt;&gt; SMITH: The president had to &gt;&gt; I would expect that he did. &gt;&gt; SMITH: But even had there the U.S. was facing a shortage and other equipment needed to And the president placed on state and local authorities &gt;&gt; Respirators, ventilators, try getting it yourselves. We will be backing you, but try &gt;&gt; When he says things like the should be trying to look after and get these things themselves, what that means is of what the country needs. &gt;&gt; SMITH: You're on your own, &gt;&gt; You're on your own, but we're all the supplies that we told Every state is basically going and bidding against and against the federal the basic supplies &gt;&gt; SMITH: By March 11, there and 36 deaths. It was then that President Trump his travel ban to European &gt;&gt; My fellow Americans, to keep new cases from entering we will be suspending all travel to the United States &gt;&gt; SMITH: The next day, Dr. and admitted they were still &gt;&gt; The system is not really to what we need right now, That is a failing. &gt;&gt; A failing? Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it is a failing. Let's admit it. &gt;&gt; He was spot on, Somebody had to say it. &gt;&gt; The way people in other we're not set up for that. &gt;&gt; I concur with Dr. Fauci. We've completely failed. This is a, At the end of the day, is set up in this country is the That every lab is fighting every state is fighting every city is fighting for I mean, that's not what you need &gt;&gt; Is it possible that your on things may be giving &gt;&gt; No. I don't think so. &gt;&gt; Misrepresenting preparedness &gt;&gt; I don't think so.

But two weeks later, Jessica's and cough. &gt;&gt; I get a phone call from my And that's when I started to get because you kept hearing the and now I'm like, &gt;&gt; SMITH: Amelia was but in the meantime, It was her mother. &gt;&gt; She said, I have a fever .&quot; And I said, &quot;No, Mami, please, And she goes, and I started coughing &gt;&gt; SMITH: Jessica's mother was The next day, just down the her sister Amelia, By now, there were over from coronavirus in America. &gt;&gt; The one time that I spoke she was very out of breath. Every word was labored, um, and were just conversing by text. But then, I-I had texted her at and she hadn't answered me back. And I, like, now started getting I get a text from her. It was, like, garbled gibberish, &quot;Call me, call me now.&quot; And, um, the doctor was there um, you know, &quot;Unfortunately, we need to intubate.&quot; &gt;&gt; Okay, thank you. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; SMITH: Since visiting was Jessica could only reach her &gt;&gt; Hi, Mami. In my heart, I know she was able but it was hard to see her I even promised her that when I'd take her to her favorite And, um, not being able to, um, and let her hear my voice has just been the worst of all Mama, I love you.

Black and Latino communities &gt;&gt; Blacks and Latinos are killed by this virus. &gt;&gt; SMITH: Cleavon Gilman is an at New York-Presbyterian. &gt;&gt; That's just due to that a live in housing projects as Uh, a lot of us are also officers, grocery clerks, um, on our whole community. Across the city, the virus has for blacks and Latinos as and poverty is also a dangerous &gt;&gt; I think this crisis has a tremendous vulnerability in where 40, 50, 60% of American barely get by day-to-day, in the American dream for their that their kids can do better and-and now our society will and deal with the reality that and pretend that that's not the &gt;&gt; SMITH: Today, the total who have died is more than A Columbia University study has that had a stay-at-home order at the end of February, it would have prevented 83% It's remarkable to me I think 55,000 American soldiers and we're now saying four times that many people die. It's-it's astounding. You know, 9/11, we lost 3,000 and in response to that, the for protecting against that costs an average of $150 We need to take this threat as as we take the threat of Um, it has the potential to kill if not considerably more, and I hope, coming out of this, whenever we do eventually come we'll finally take seriously of health security and public (sirens wailing) &gt;&gt; SMITH: Finally, there was the In New York, scores of health New Yorkers tried Every day, thousands went and to their windows (cheering, applause) (air horn blowing) (cheering, applause continue) All the while, the number of Trucks made their daily runs to where the poorest among us Worldwide, the virus has killed In the U.S., a nationwide to the steepest drop in since the Great Depression.
