And it didn't matter They could have broken arms and cases, they could even So he was just saying that And he was supposed to go to But he snuck out of the to Misrata to fight. And how is it there now? Does he know how it is now? [SPEAKING ARABIC] SHANE: And if they don't kill [SPEAKING ARABIC] SHANE: Though the fighting had months at this point, every still defiant. Even though the odds seemed so were still really their chances for victory.

It's carrying about 300 troops, There's been heavy Some journalists have As we pulled into the port, of the past fighting There was some minor damage to There were a couple of Mad Max bolted on the back. But other than that, it But that quiet didn't So we just arrived in Misrata. We're hearing artillery [GENERAL COMMOTION AND SHANE: You can see the smoke They know the ship is arriving, missiles just to let them Hello. Thank you. Good, how are you? Good. [SPEAKING ARABIC] Driving into Misrata, it seemed really high, and the city was Anyone who drove by horns and waved excitedly. It was only when we reached realized how immediate and really been. [SPEAKING ARABIC] SHANE: Some of the heaviest the revolution was right here one of the main arteries of to Tripoli itself. Gaddafi had ordered his troops so the fighting had been His troops holed up on a high fighters until the rebels had The old building manager to show us the aftermath. [SPEAKING ARABIC] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] SHANE: The fighting on Tripoli before we got there. In and front lines had moved on, the road, towards So to get there we hitched a was running weapons [MIDDLE EASTERN MUSIC] [SPEAKING ARABIC] SHANE: One of the first places this kind of half junkyard, apocalyptic weapons factory. Every kind of gun or missile weapon you could possibly affixed to a truck. And your truck got They just put your gun and you keep fighting. [MIDDLE EASTERN MUSIC] [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKING ARABIC] SHANE: And course, anything behind was put back into use And that included not only batteries, but also tanks, and these grad missile launching spotted on the beach.

He's asking Clinton and Obama to they can go take Tripoli, so he is to play for the Miami MOHAMMED: Yes. SHANE: Yes. He wants to come to America. OK. The thing that struck me the front line was just how rebels were. It was pretty surreal to watch puberty, fighting and abstract concept of freedom. Abstract because real freedom known, as Gaddafi had before they were born. After long days of traveling kilometers outside of Misrata, Our driver handed us off to us the rest of the way. When we finally got to the nervous about our camera giving And we had to limit our shots. They were obviously digging in, that they told us they were to 24 hours. In fact, while we were there, offensive was about to start. So they advised to leave Misrata could, because they thought was going to be huge. [SPEAKING ARABIC] There's no ships out. We took the last ship in. So we're going to take Aside from ourselves, the few rebels who were heading cameras and offered to show The boat back to Benghazi kilometers an hour. And this afforded me a lot what I had just seen. I had witnessed something in read about in history books-- revolution. People rising up against everything to do. [ANIMATED INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] SHANE: Everyone, without why they were fighting, And so young Libyans are risking CAPTAIN ALI: Only for freedom. We want to be like Europe, We don't ask for much. SHANE: Right. [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKING ARABIC] SHANE: Despite still being troops, everyone on board was Tripoli was just around And it turned out About a month later, that's [ANIMATED INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] SHANE: Suddenly, after a long rebels finally stormed [ANIMATED INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] SHANE: Now the next few months the rebels switch from fighting will be problematic and filled What just happened in Libya can write our own history.
