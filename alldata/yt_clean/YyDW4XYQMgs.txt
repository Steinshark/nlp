Hi, I'm Josh. I'm Ollie. And happy Thanksgiving! Today we're in a British high school. Because we're going to give some British highschoolers What do you guys know about Thanksgiving? Uh, not much. You've got to be thankful. Yeah. That's always a good place to start. It's not thanks-taking. No. Huge turkeys. That's it. Do you know when it is? Fourth of July? July the 4th? I don't know. Independance day, I've got no idea. Fourth of July? Completely different, those are completely different holidays. The first thing we've got is the famous Thanksgiving sandwich. Wow. It's huge. This is huge. What? What is this? It's based on a recipe from Friends. After Thanksgiving, with the leftovers, you So it's like when you have a roast dinner And you have a chicken sandwich the next day. Exactly. Can we try it? How do I even? So many flavours. Yeah, there's a lot. It's got a bit of everything in there, really. It does, doesn't it? I don't know how they all go together, but But I don't know how I'm meant to eat it now. It's really good. It's the best thing I've had all day. Oh, that's a lot. It's a lot. Oh. Too much. Too much. Cranberry sauce. Yeah? Don't like it. Oh, you don't like cranberry sauce? That could be a problem. The way it looks right now, it's full of colours. It's almost as if that's the same feeling A rainbow of flavours. Very nice. Actually stuffing, turkey. Another piece of bread. Do you notice anything different about that It's like... Wetter. It is. That's exactly what it is. Ross calls it the moist maker. That sounds like some supervillain or something. Slightly off-putting. This is such a good idea. This is like the greatest thing. It's a perfect sandwich. Everything you want. But I'd still have a chicken or turkey sandwich Really? Yeah. Interesting. That literally is a turkey sandwich. Yeah, but the English don't do flavour, do they? The next thing we're going to try is a Thanksgiving This is a sweet potato casserole. What on earth? It's marshmallow. On a massive mound of sweet potatoes. This looks nice. Wow, that is sweet. Not that I'd look at it and I think it's sweet. I just smell the sweetness. This is so bizarre to me. Marshmallows are meant to be on a stick. You know, put them on a fire. That's where you eat them. So is it like cream and sweet potato? Well, take a look. What do you think? So soft. Is that marshmallow? Yes. Wait, I don't want a whole marshmallow. I'm making a meal of this. I'm making a meal of this. I don't know. Sweet potato. Is this marshmallow? Yeah. Oh, wow. Oh, my gosh. This tastes quite... Is it marshmallow? Yeah. Marshmallow and sweet potato. Yeah. It's nice. I'm not going to lie. Yeah? I'm not the biggest fan of it. No, you're not a fan? I like the marshmallow, but I don't like I don't think they're good together personally. But you know what? This is nice, I think, as a pudding. OK. Is this a pudding? It's actually not a dessert. Really? This is part of the... No. But you know what? I'm not going to complain. This tastes lovely. It does taste lovely. OK. Is it for like after, dessert or something No, this is a... It's a main course. It's a part of the main course. It's well, you have it alongside your turkey. How can you have turkeys and marshmallows? Marshmallows and sweet potatoes. It's crazy. I would never have thought of it. Potato and a marshmallow, no. Typical American thing. Yeah, exactly. Definitely. Adding marshmallows to stuff. What we've got for you now is an actual dessert. Ok, this is exciting. This is exciting. This is probably the most classic Thanksgiving dessert. I think I know what this is. Pumpkin pie. Pumpkin pie. I'm not a big fan of pumpkins. Oh no. I've never actually had pumpkin pie. It's something I've always heard, but I've Can we cut it? Yeah, go for it. Oh wow. Don't do that much. That's a big slice. No, cut that in half. That's your plate. And you do that much. All right, you want it? Here's your slice. What on earth? Do you expect me to get through the whole I love the optimism that you're keen that Or if it's anything like the sweet potato A bit of whipped cream? Yes please. This is a favourite of mine. That's good. This is nice. And this is 100% a dessert, not a main course. This is a dessert. This is not coming with your main course. You're not having any turkey beside that. It's beautiful. Yeah, I actually like this one. That's beautiful. This one's very nice. Beautiful. It's exquisite. Fancy words are coming out. That is so nice. No, I've definitely had this before. Oh, you've had it before? Yeah, yeah. That's good. You just didn't realise you were having pumpkin Yeah, yeah. Very interesting. It's better than I thought it would be. Okay. It tastes like the Starbucks drink. Pumpkin spice latte. Yeah. I think that drink is actually modelled after Americans know their stuff. They know their food. It's definitely better than the sweet potato. - I'd rather this. Look at Louis, he's almost done. Do they feed you at home? I can't really taste much pumpkin, but it's Is that your favourite so far? Yeah. No, no, the sandwich, the sandwich. I love it. This next one we have is called pecan pie. This next one we have is called pecan pie. What's a pecan? Pecan! You've never had pecan nuts before? No. I've never really had nuts before. You've never had nuts? You've never had nuts? Mate. Have you ever had pecan pie before? No. Have you ever had pecans? No, I don't think so. I've never heard of any of this. Looks like a forest. A forest. Like a forest floor with all the nuts fallen It actually does. Like acorns and dry crispy leaves. Oh, great. Best one. Oh my goodness. So usually I'm not a fan of nuts. But it's nice. I like that. It's a bit too nutty. That's hard to... It's too nutty. A nut pie. What did you expect, Malachi? Oh, it smells like chocolate! You know what... Oh my gosh. What was that? My mum told me to swallow everything. Is it that bad? You don't like it? I thought it'd have been softer. OK, it's a bit crunchy. I think that's why it surprises me. People at home are now gonna think we got a horrible pecan pie! I think this is great. Yeah, mi gusta mucho. This is very nice. Mi gusta mucho. There's some people that will say it's too sweet. Those people are wrong. There's no such thing as too sweet. I'm not sure about that one. Extremely sweet. Yeah, really sweet. Kind of like sickening sweet. I don't know what it is. It feels like you've just got nuts from the It just got syrup on it. I think it's just the nuts for me. I don't think I like puking nuts. They're not puking nuts. It's a puking nut. Have you heard of the presidential turkey pardon? No. Sounds a bit scary. Are we meant to know? No. It's a strange tradition. The president is gifted a live turkey from And then he obviously could kill it for his But he issues an official presidential pardon. On behalf of the nation. What? Pardons the turkey? For what? What did the turkey do? Yeah, what did he do that he needs a pardon? That's a good point. He was too tasty. What I used to do every Thanksgiving at my school, Is you'd go around the table. And say one thing that you're thankful for Do you guys want to give us what you're thankful for? Oh. Don't make me cry. Go on. Oh, you don't have to look at each other. I like this. Eye contact.
