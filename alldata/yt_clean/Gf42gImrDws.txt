And actually, coming around the Not a lot, but I feel hamstrung in The Plaid gets right up but you lose half a second, and 30 feet with how Talking about the brakes, this Like, the carbon and they come with ALISTAIR WEAVER: like around a more but it might be worth so that you might lose a bit through the corner, felt a little bit hamstrung and fire it out of the exit.

It just turns, it It brakes really well for The turning is nice. In contrast to the just get back on the power and the car kind rather than feeling like you're it doesn't really want to do. JONATHAN ELFALAN: I felt like Like, the brakes in The brakes in this car of slowing you down, but I You have the stopping power, But that being the launch was I didn't get that Certainly coming off the corner, Actually got a little bit but it just felt like I could And I definitely prefer that.
