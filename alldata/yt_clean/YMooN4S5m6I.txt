Oh wow look a completely normal desert temple. I wonder what's inside. Oh. Uhhhhh. Uhhhhh. UHHHHHHHHH. Well this is weird. Yeah, this is a tiny desert temple. Um. It's a little off-putting. But this was made based off of a comment from Visca-Viscalis? I'm sure I completely butchered your name so I'm so sorry. The comment says a museum that has every Minecraft structure built out of mini display entities on display. And sure enough we have the Museum of Tiny Stuffs. And this is the desert temple. Ah ha ha ha. This took me an hour to build. A couple weeks ago I built a sphere in vanilla Minecraft. Uh. No mods. Kinda crazy. But you'll notice that my frame rate is 77 frames per second. 79, 80. Um. If I go ahead and just take this and delete it. 600, 1000, 1067 frames. Wow. That really took a toll on my computer. So needless to say we're gonna be doing the rest of this video without the sphere here. Don't worry, I backed up the world because that took way too long for me to just immediately delete it. Uh. But wow. This is-this is so much better. And today we're gonna take this concept one step further. I asked you on my community tab for some crazy things that I could build with display entities. And you guys did not disappoint. As you can see right here. Display entities are absolutely wild. And today we're using Axiom to control them and use them in really cool ways. All of which are suggested by you. As you can see I haven't filled out this entire museum with stuff. As we go through this video we're gonna add things to this museum. Starting with this comment. A real looking gaming PC. Well it's funny you should mention that because while I'm building it. This video is sponsored by Apex Gaming PCs. If you've been feeling like the hardware in your current computer just makes gaming feel impossible. Then I highly recommend you take a look at Apex Gaming PCs. Okay. General case form factor. They're a PC building company with an excellent selection of hardware for you to choose from. And we've gone ahead and put together three preset tiers of computers for you to start with. Motherboard. Couple sticks of RAM. CPU. All of which are built and tested by Apex to make sure they just work when they get to you. Let's pretend those are fans. Graphics card. They have great performance in modern games and they use hardware from trusted component manufacturers. Like Nvidia and AMD. Power supply thing. Bottom piece of the case. Plus if you don't like the specs of the ones that I chose, you can customize your build with the Apex configurator to cater to your specific needs. Fan. A CPU cooler. Today instead of using my code. All of the prices on the Apex website have actually been lowered by 30 percent across their entire lineup. Including my PC builds. They've gone ahead and listened to feedback from partners and have decided to make a massive change to their price structure. In an effort to give more people access to a high powered gaming computer. CPU cooler piece there. I'm going to use candles for pipes. Nice. Wow. Actually you know what? That actually doesn't look terrible. Only one thing left to do here. Perfect. So that being said head on down to the link in the description and get your new PC today. Now is literally a better time than ever before. Huge thanks Apex Gaming PCs for sponsoring this video and now let's head to the next comment. A downscaled village that you can walk on like a giant. LOL get Pehkui involved. Yes perfect idea. When I tell you this took me about two hours today. I am not kidding. Because each one of these is each individual display entities. I thought that took a long time but man. The fun part of this one though is that these these villagers that are in here. They're real villagers. They're just scaled down. So I had to put barrier blocks in all around the edges so they just wouldn't walk off the edge. I could also join them. Hey man how's it going. How are you. Oh I don't know what happened there. We're just going to move on. Each of these houses does have some interior detail but as you can see. I'm kind of in the floor. This probably took the longest this little church structure because. Yeah I had to do each individual piece. I had to include stuff inside. There's torches. There's there's so much detail to this. There's a lot of detail I didn't think was here. But yeah here we are. Hey guys how's it go- Oh. Oh. Oh... So now I just have a tiny village. Was it worth it? But it looks really cool. It's kind of a surreal little diorama. You could spawn a text display with red text and the word subscribe. I wonder what this word means but I think your viewers should definitely do it. Oh yes let me walk out of my house here and uh. Hmm. What do you think tiny villager? Should they subscribe? Iron Golem did you know that 75 percent of my viewers aren't subscribed and they need to subscribe. Please please let them subscribe. Are you going to beat them up if they don't. Watch out. A secret entrance with a block that's secretly a display entity so you can fall through it. Hmm yes a mystery entrance to a secret room. I like it. And the funny thing is it's been here the whole time. Right under your noses. If I can find where is mine. Oh oh I got it. I figured it out. Well? That's right. It's not real. It's a fake block. I could move it. It's it's not real. Blocks aren't real. Change my mind. It's very strange. I can just stand in the block! What the heck And then you just sink into the floor. Hey how you doing. No one will know. Don't tell anybody. It's a secret that only you and I know about. Any art you want. It just has to make you think. Take think however you want. Mmm thinking. Mmm. Such skillfully made artwork. Mmm hmm. Yes yes. You know I've never really understood this style of art. But hey you know art is subjective so that makes you think you know. Like why is there a blue square in the middle of a red field. Is it a representation of society. Is it is it something special that the artist intended. Or is it literally just a blue square on a red rectangle. I don't know. I made the thing and I have no clue. I should really sign this. Think by Knarfy. Inspired by @TheLightsaberMaker. Truly a wonder of the world. Art. Art is- Art makes you think. Put down in the comments what you think about this. What does this make your brain think about? What do you think? Either a miniature house or a massive one. Well we've already kind of done the miniature houses. So let's do the massive house. You wanna know my favorite thing? Since the last time that we did this, they fixed the group duplication system. So now is it not only easier to make a sphere but we can make this house incredibly huge. Whoa. Has it touched the ground yet? No. There we go. There we go. Summon a player for scale and- Big house. I think we need a big villager to go along with this. Oh! OH! Too big. Too big. There we go. Perfect. Now he's got a big house. Because he's a big guy. So he needs a big house. That's a really big house. The greatest thing too is that we could make it bigger. Here we go. Here we go. Oh. Okay. Now that is a big house. Jeez it takes forever to move it anywhere because it just- OH it disappeared. Oh no. There's a certain limit to how far we can see things. Oh man. It's really it really doesn't know what to do. Look at that big house. Giant house. Oh my word. That is just wild looking. This house big enough for ya? Wow. Well we did it. Big house complete. It's probably gonna disappear. Yeah it's just gonna disappear if I can- Oh I can only see that. Well I guess we're gonna have giant stairs floating in the sky. Cool. Yes beautiful. I'm gonna leave that guy out here. Make a penguin please. You know. I'll try. We'll find out if my penguin building skills are any good. I'm gonna try to completely do this from memory. I'm not gonna look anything up. I think that coal block. Yeah. I'm gonna shrink this down a little bit. Yep tall body. Give him a little head here. I'm gonna shrink this down a little more. Okay. That's the that's the head. Gosh making animals is not my strong suit here. Okay I got this. I need this to be a wing. I'm gonna spin it and then move it in. You know what that's not too bad like that. I like that. Okay. Perfection. And now I can just shrink this down a little bit and then change this to a nice like white color. Let's do smooth quartz. Oh that doesn't look right. Down. And this is the tail. Yeah. I need a couple little feet. Little flippers. Let's change this to a yellow I think. You know what it actually kind of works though. I like that. Oh they're a little too low. There we go. It's missing some eyes though. Let's do that. Oh no. No. I'm keeping it but oh no. This guy's seen some things man. This guy's been this guy's been through it. I changed the beak and it made it worse. Look at him. He's beautiful. Oh my beautiful penguin boy. I've got the perfect name for this exhibit. Are you ready. This right here is a pengin. My beautiful pengin man. Look at this guy. Look at this dude. Just the blank stare into infinity is so terrifying. Oh man. All right. I've been looking at this for too long. I need to move on. This is perfect. Why do I love this so much? Why do I love them? Oh their eyes aren't even attached. I didn't realize. Look at them. Okay. I need to move on. I've been moving. I need to move on. This is too good. One very funky songe. I'm not going to lie to you. I don't entirely know what a songe is, but I'll think of something. This feels like a songe right. I'm just going to make it real wacky. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh that's that's pretty wacky. I can't. This is so hard to comprehend. What is going on here? I don't even know how I was able to morph it. This is a songe if I've ever seen one between songe and thousand eye stare over there. We're getting some crazy stuff in this video. It's so trippy. What? Why does it do the weird like perspective warping thing? funky songe I'm just struggling to comprehend it. You know, like I just, I'm just struggling to like figure out how this exists. For the record, this could exist in vanilla Minecraft. Like this. We don't need the mod to see what's going on here. And that, that breaks my brain a little bit. I am broken. And so is this songe. A bunch of redstone blocks shown in cross sections with what the inside would look like. Oh, this is a fascinating concept. So for example, here's an observer, right? And if we think a little bit about what is inside of it, we can think of like other redstone components that could probably be in here. Or in the case of this thing, I have a, I have an idea. Here we go. Here we go. Boom. Now we have an eye on the inside. Oh, that's so cool. Oh my gosh. I can actually make this happen. Wait, this is so cool. I scaled this negatively. Essentially is what happened here. I set the transformation, the scale here to negative one. And that allows you to look into the block, which is kind of awesome. It's so trippy. Like this is just crazy. I'm going to do this. So we'll take a repeater. We're basically just trying to show how the inside of this observer works. So essentially what we're going to try to do here is get it from this point to this, this output and actually have components doing their jobs, which is such a cool concept. I actually kind of love this. Okay. So let's say the eye in here observes something, right? We'll take a comparator reading from it, which makes sense, right? The comparator makes a lot of sense. And then we give this a little bit of a, uh, sync up thing here. And then we get some redstone dust. And now we have these outputting to that. And then this is the observer and this is how an observer works. Check it out. Yeah, that makes sense, right? Oh my gosh. You know, it'd be even better actually. Wait, hold on. That's actually so cool. I'm trying to make it something that like actually makes a lot of sense. You know, that's kind of legit. The inside of an observer. Incredible. I love this concept of like, what does the inside of a redstone block look like? You know, inner workings. Look at it. That in and of itself is kind of a neat idea for an entire video, honestly. So what a cool concept to explore. If you guys also want to explore this concept, you're welcome to! The axiom mod is free to download. You can try it yourself. That's so cool. Okay. All right. I have one more thing that I want to finish out this line with and the comment just says burger. burger. We're going to make burger. So starting with the bottom bun, what do we do for that? Let's see how this looks. Yeah. You know, I don't hate that. I think that's pretty great. This burger is going to be kind of a square. So Wendy's burger, I guess. Oh, wait, no. What if we use actual like food items in this? Oh, this actually could be great. Let me make the top bun a little more detail. Give it a little curve on the top. There we go. Just going to group that together and top bun. Okay, so we got the bottom bun. Let's start with like, how about a sauce? Netherrack seems like actually a pretty good option for that. It might be, it's a little gross thinking about it as Netherrack, but you know, it's supposed to be sauce. Okay. Don't overthink it. We're going to pretend that that's a layer of sauce that works, I guess. Let's do some steak. Oh, geez. Okay. Let's do, let's do like four of them. So kind of like this, I'm going to stack them. So we're not getting any sort of Z fighting. Sure. I mean, that's not bad, right? That's pretty good. Okay. Burger Patty. That kind of works. Yeah. I will put that on the burger. It's no longer just a square burger. I like it. Okay. Now let's get cheese. I think. What's a good cheese block? Oh, you know what? Perfect cheese block. Got it. Nailed it. Sponge cheese. It's not quite. It's not quite yellow, but you know what? It's, it's, it's kind of, it's kind of cheese. Maybe there's something better. Oh, oooooo. Okay. That actually kind of works. It's not like the perfect option. I don't know, but you know, I like it. I think, I think the raw gold works. What if we just do regular gold? Would the regular gold look better? You know, actually, yes. Regular gold. We're going with regular gold because it looks like it's shiny melted. We need veggies. So what if we just did leaves? It's just straight up leaves, you know, as like, as like, as like lettuce, maybe. I don't know, man. I think it works, right? Lettuces, lettuce is on there now. Yeah. That works. How do I do onions? Cause I kind of want to put onions on this burger. Iron trap door, maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe underneath the lettuce. Okay. Yes. Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, we have onions. Onions, lettuce, cheese, burger. Anything else? What else do we even put on burgers? What goes on burgers? Tomato. Tomato could be good. Uh, yeah. Uh, yeah. Mangrove trap door. Using a couple trap doors today. And you know what? We'll shrink this down and we'll do like little tomatoes. You know? Like, like tomato, like tomato rings, you know? Like you cut them and then they're in like little rings, right? So then you just, you have tomato rings. I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm clearly a culinary expert. Yeah. That's nice. I don't hate that. I hate that. The weird, weird glitchiness, but I don't, you know, I don't hate the burger. I could see myself eating this. It looks very square and crunchy, but I could see it. And then we just place the bun on top. Yeah. Burger. That actually looks kind of good. All right. Burger going over here. Why is, please hold for burger repair. Ladies and gentlemen, burger. I'd eat the whole thing. (MUNCH) You know, it works. It's-- What do you think? Long burger. Brings a whole new meaning to smash burger burger accomplished burger acquired burger. We have really filled this place out. I think I need one more display here though. And you know what I'll put there. My old pal, this disc, perfect disc. And that completes the museum of tiny stuff. This wall is bare. Those walls are also, there's nothing on the ceiling. This is, this is kind of empty. It's, you know what? It's good enough. I'll make it feel better. I'm going to add a red carpet. There we go. Perfect. Amazing. Incredible stuff. And it's filled with tiny people. I'm honestly kind of happy with this. Like I'm actually pretty proud of what I've put together here today. So thank you all for watching. I will see you guys next time. Uh oh. Comment &quot;burgr&quot; if you see this :)
