Ly Tieu Ca's family would like to greet everyone, wish everyone a happy new day. Every day he takes the time to water the vegetables. It seems he loves nature. The vegetables are growing very well. Ah... are you not eating? ? ... let's eat .. you want to eat meat.. let's eat meat ... let's eat together Hey... dad is home. Are you done watering? Done... are you feeding your child something? The vegetables are growing and they look so good. Since the chicken fertilizer application, they have grown very well. She's a bit anorexic. When she's grown up, she has to eat on her own . Ah.. Did you water the garden over there when you picked the vegetables in the morning? I've already watered it. So... I'm going to feed the chickens... and there's a flock of chicks too, right? Dad, let's go. Remember to check the number of hens. I remember... there are too many foxes these days.. ok, I'll check. Mom, get some water for you to drink. Here's your water. This is a chicken farm. .. we will bring the newly hatched hens here to take care of them individually. That will help the chicks develop better and avoid being jostled. Currently there are about 100 chicks here when the chicks are healthy. We'll let them out. The tomatoes are over there. Wash them. Just go ahead When you want to wash it , why are you screaming now to put it in? It's all wet. He's cutting bamboo to make a frame for the gate. The rose tree will climb up to create a rose gate .... don't leave it like that. Are you done...um Come on in. Let's change clothes. Give it to mom... that's right, let it dry for mom ... give it to mom... Han, give it here... come on... let's go see the chickens Face like a cat then Let's go see which gate it is. Can you help me hold it ? Does our house have a wire? No, now you need to tie the flower stem to bamboo to create a frame, then they will grow into a flower gate. Please eat this piece of orange.
