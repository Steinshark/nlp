Awakening Intensive Lisbon 3 - 7 April 2024 Refuse Mind's Biscuit [Questioner] Thank you. [Q.] First of all, thank you your teachings brought to me in different, in difficult times. I struggle with something [Q.] and I think I might not get something right. [Q.] When I listen to your teachings, of the heart and the home, But when I do the practice, and it happened here in satsang, [Q.] I'm having a very hard time. [Q.] I get lost. In this question: 'Who is this who?' [Mooji] Who is this ... As an example, and instantly I realise, [Mooji] Ah, that's the trouble. [Q.] Then there is this, And then it goes [Mooji] No, it's not meant it's meant to chop something. The reason why the question comes, is because somehow we come to this place and then something wants to claim, Something wants to claim 'Yes, I went there, I found this. I know who I am, I hear this lots of times, And it feels as though Then I ask, You, who, have done it? You say, 'Pardon? Me!' Yes, but you particularly are what? You say, 'But, me! I did it. I did it.' Show me what you've done. Do you see? So, this feeling of 'I', given the gift of saying, Now I went above everything, Watch this guy! It's a ghost. And it's not the Holy Ghost. OK? [Mooji] It is a ghost and it's causing a lot of trouble on this planet. Because it is arrogant. It's not impartial. So this exercise, when it's done right, So tell me again, where it goes right, and where it goes wrong. [Q.] Exactly when I begin. [Mooji] Yes. What do I say? [Q.] Om. [Q.] There is a moment when there is just being. [Mooji] Is beingness an object of perception? Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Is beingness an object of perception? Meaning, 'Ah, yes I can see the beingness'. Somebody said, 'Yes'? Is it an object of perception? 'Yes, I can see, It's good, like this? As different from the mind. [Q.] Yes. [Q.] And then, exactly, there is this, and then I think that it's fake. That if I see that I sense [Mooji] Yes. [Q.] And then I get lost ... [Mooji] 'If I can see the sense of beingness ...' Is beingness a dualistic experience? Please take a little moment. and it becomes clear, Om. [Mooji imitates the sound of the bell] OK? [Mooji breathes out a long slow breath] [laughter] [Mooji] 'Ah, yes, yes. 'I' and being. Then the question comes ... [Q.] Maybe I'm lying to myself, [Mooji] Blind or lying? [Mooji] Then the question comes ... [Q.] Yes, I feel it and then, [M.] So you're separate OK. Are you less than the being, [Mooji] Let's slow down. It's worth it. [M.] 'I feel the being. The beingness is an experience that Am I greater than the beingness Let's slow down. [silence] [Q.] I don't know. [Mooji] So, 'I can see the beingness'. The mind comes and says, Ah, it feels nice, feels nice.' But then, what happens? The next point, next now, [Q.] I doubt it. [Mooji] No, no, no. [Q.] 'This is not it.' [Q.] 'You're lying to yourself, [Mooji] This doubt, is it a friend? You've not found anything in your life So doubt comes, 'You're lying to yourself'. 'This is not it!' Does the doubt come as a friend to help you? [voice from audience] Yes! [M.] So the one who is helped by doubt, I would like you to come down and show me. The doubt has come, OK, it's useful. We're going to make use of it, 'OK, step one, two, three, bing, beer! But you say that doubt has come, So what do you do? Or do you say, 'Hey, wait a second'? The doubt says, 'You're not it'. OK. Now what? Doubt has come to help you, You're not this being. You're not this being.' OK? And then immediately you feel, You believe the doubt immediately, [Q.] Everything breaks in pieces. [Q.] That's my experience, [M.] So the doubt was more true [Q.] I'm sorry, can you repeat? because beingness was very nice. And something goes, [Mooji mimics a person in distress] [M.] OK? Now something is disturbed, It's not like somebody gave it to you. 'Look, here it is.' It's not an object. Beingness is not an object of your attention. Now some shift has happened to somehow, 'Whoa'. A sense of spaceousness and peace, where the mind in its was seen like, 'OK, OK. But quickly, a voice comes, 'Not it!' [Q.] Exactly. [Mooji] Is this it? [Mooji] So how valuable is the doubt? The doubt comes from the doubter. Something that always hijacks your happiness. It comes quickly and says, And not only were you able to say, It immediately went So why was it attackable? Because you were experiencing it Not your experience. Your mind or the sense of being? [Q.] The sense of being. [Mooji] And the doubt comes to tell you, Could it be that this false friend, When we say, the mind, and the closer you come to exposing the thief, the more he keeps throwing stones in the bush, you [imitates looking over there] Because you're easily put off the scent! There, there ... the police were training these dogs, to catch drugs and stuff like that. They're trying to find the dog So they put them to smell, And then, when they find something, they start to flash their tail or something. And then the trainer comes and says, and gives him a doggy biscuit But if the dog is put on the exercise again, and the trainer comes and gives him a biscuit, and then he gives up the search then they say, The dog that is searching for the drugs, when you give him a biscuit, he doesn't want it. When he catches the drug, So this is like, you're on to this thing, and you're going deeper, and somebody, And you go. The biscuit is, 'That's not it'. And you feel down. A depresssion-biscuit comes. And so this is a stage ... [laughs] Do you like this one? [Mooji] This is a stage that is important, to see that it is also to say, 'This is not it'. To put you off the scent. You've come to the sense of beingness. From the place of beingness You see? OK. But the thing is, even in the sense of beingness. But only for a bit. Because as you remain, observing mind, you'll see that there're still some toxins left [M.] You keep catching them out like that. [Q.] Yes. You took the biscuit, from the mind. And then it threw you into some chaos. And then you feel, You gave up prematurely, like that. [Mooji] Is it useful, what we're sharing? [Mooji] Very good. [Q.] Not take the biscuit. [Mooji] It's good! Don't take that biscuit! [applause from audience] [Mooji] Do that exercise, either now, [Q.] From the card? [Q.] The exercise from the card? [Mooji] It may be from the card, It could be from sitting. It can be the sitting today, also you can watch. Then something can come. Do it, and let me test it out with you. [Q.] Yes. [Q.] Yes. And just a follow up, I don't want to follow the doubt, and when it breaks in those pieces ... [M.] When it what? [Q.] is there a way back? [Mooji] Yes. Now you will see it. Now you will see the doubts arising 'Actually, now I can see again, OK? The biscuit is being offered. But it's still only something perceived. Say, 'That is also perceived'. Stay only as the witness, Don't pick up anything from the mind. This is such a valuable thing, Because you're looking for this, or the one sees the dog coming Then he takes the burger, Don't buy this thing. [M.] And it's going to work powerfully for you. Because when these things come it's because there's something so valuable And we're all being cheated out of it by our own naivity or innocence. And you're going to grow powerfully in this. There're not a lot of things Just watch the mechanism It's very sneaky. Because after a while, it catches hold of you and you work for it. You believe it. I want to bring it to a place, the schemes of the mind ... You're out of this cage. [M.] It's good? [Mooji] Thank you. Copyright 2024 Mooji Media Ltd.
