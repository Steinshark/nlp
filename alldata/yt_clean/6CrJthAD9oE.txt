(music) Volvo is a company known for safe, reliable, That reputation was solidified in the public's Built for the wild, winter conditions of Sweden, no matter what. And go on it did, with a 19-year production run, So, what's the boxy Volvo got in common Touring Car championship without selling any This is the Volvo 240 Story. (music) Volvo introduced the 140 series in 1966. Cars in the 60s were death traps compared In a frontal collision the engine would be injure you then the spear-like steering column The 140 series was an attempt to change this. It featured crumple zones at the front and kinetic energy, the dashboard was designed column would split in two to prevent damage. It also used superior disc brakes both front allow the brakes to work even if one of the With whiplash a real problem, the 140 introduced The car did well, selling 1.2M vehicles in Seeing safety as a key selling point, Volvo With road deaths at or near record highs around flock to something that protected the driver So, in 1968 they started a program to make 10 prototypes were produced over 2 years, standard on cars over the years. Rubber bumpers, reinforced doors to help with zones and even airbags. The P1560 program was cancelled in 1971 due like the USA, but these ideas morphed into a car that took another step in Volvo's With a long front and rear, the car's crumple a 50mph frontal impact. The cars' engine firewall would force the now standard on all cars with an engine up A spring would retract the steering column, rear to protect rear passengers. The reinforced doors also introduced side And passengers could survive the car falling The car also included ABS, a backup warning seatbelts that pulled tight in case of a crash, mounted fuel tank, door warning lights and The VESC was shown at the 1972 Geneva Motor It was a much larger car, and although a lot the intention was to create a car this size 1973 oil crisis put paid to all thoughts of With the P1560 cancelled, Volvo wanted a replacement But with limited resources they used the 144 The designer of this boxy car, Jan Wilsgaard er... sorry... Jan Wilsgaard was brought in to design it. Jan was integral in the design of many Volvo's, 850 in the 1990s. The 240 used most of the 140's body, reworking and using the same rear suspension. But Volvo had learnt a lot from the VESC prototype, car than the 140. As far as styling went, it seems that Jan The car was all straight lines, something eschewing fashion for their own unique boxy And it also showed definite styling cues from But what counted was it was a well-proportioned Volvo created a new 4-cylinder engine for Peugeot and Renault. The same V6 was used to power Marty McFly The 4-cylinder would be a 2.1L, but Volvo to help sell the car in markets where tax Diesels were sourced from Volkswagen. The car would have a 4-speed manual or a 3-speed The 240 was unveiled in August 1974, just won the Eurovision Song Contest with "Waterloo", Grand Slam title, the French Open. In 1974 all roads were leading to Sweden. Volvo's marketing played heavily on 240's The headrests had a lattice-like structure better visibility and the larger bumpers provided The Volvo 260 followed in October, although years as Volvo eked out as much profitability that they would continue to do with other cars. OK - at this point we need to go over the Volvo 200 series numbering system. It's really simple! Let's take the 245DL. The two means, 2! The 4 means the number of cylinders in the 4 for 4-cylinders, and 6 for 6-cylinders. That is, except for when Volvo decided And then diesel 240s had 5 or 6-cylinders, and sometimes Volvo sold high spec The third number is the number of doors. 2 for a 2-door car, 4 for a 4-door saloon, Then there was the 243, with one door on one No one quite knows why they did that! Then in 1983 they just used 240 and 260 for So, what's that "DL" doing on the end Well, "DL" stood for the "Deluxe" "GLE" for "Grand Luxe Executive", &quot;GT&quot; of course being "Grand Tourer", "T" for "Transfer" and "C" for Then there were the following special edition And my favourite, the "Thor" edition was It probably came with its own special hammer All clear? Good! The 240 and 260 were an instant success, and the man with 2.4 children and a dog, to lecturers, The Volvo's alternate take on the car spoke The V6 might not have been the most reliable, giving the car bullet-proof reliability. Some loved its safety features and Volvo made they'd survived a crash only because they And with those large crumple zones, there engine on the rare occasion it did go wrong. In 1976 the 240 started offering catalytic giving a 90% reduction in air polluting gases. In 1978 the 240 was named the USA's cleanest Not only were lives being saved inside the A special edition 264TE limousine model was Many were sold to the communist East wouldn't be seen dead in cars from West The following year the similar "T" version With three rows of seats it was used as a In the mid-70s Volvo was visited by Ford executives, Although the meeting led to nothing, Volvo to the Lincoln that might do well in the American Something with a little more presence on the Without the resources to do it themselves Milan to see what they could do. In 1977 Volvo released the luxury car as the To give it a better stance on the road the Volvo briefly offered an open top variant about safety it was withdrawn. The 2-door coupe was sold until 1981, and 1978 brought a small facelift to the 240, co-developed with Volkswagen. Both 5 and 6-cylinder versions were available. They proved to be unpopular due to poor reliability, foibles are now well understood. Although the diesel was one of the quickest 240's image as a slow, plodding, boring Volvo intended to change that in 1981 with They uprated the 4-cylinder 2.1L to 155hp. The higher power meant the car could now get Not fantastic, but enough to give the car In 1982 a new Touring Car Group A was introduced Volvo produced a competition version with a top speed of 162mph. 500 vehicles needed to be produced in competition "240 Turbo Evolution" cars, splitting The special components were shipped as a kit However, once they were inspected by the motorsports and they were sold as normal cars! The rules didn't state they had to be sold, the rules, just not the spirit of the rules! Those 500 cars in the USA have flatter, more Nevertheless, Volvo did go racing in 1984. Although the big boxy car was aerodynamically the European Touring Car Championship in 1985. With the 240 being produced for 9 years, Volvo the 700 series in 1984. The new model was more upmarket, so commanded Volvo stopped producing the 260, but kept and to get a little more revenue from their The Volvo 700 series was a success, with Jan It was sold until 1992 with the launch of But although the 700 was meant to replace It was still being produced in 1993, 19 years But production did eventually end, and Volvo The last 240 was a crazy shortened clown car, I suppose it was a funnier joke when it was But with such a long production run, they The 240 sold an amazing 2.8M cars over 19 It's about this time that I ask you to subscribe, so this time I thought I'd just sit here and play while you do it.
