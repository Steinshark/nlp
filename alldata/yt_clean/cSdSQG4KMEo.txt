I love you, Alan! No! Noooooo! What happened? I'm obsessed with this game called Honkai Star Rail. It's a space fantasy game and the anime-style characters are so cool! Look! Oh my god! Sorry, it's just that the character I'm playing, Feixiao, just fell into moon mania. She's going crazy. I have so much power! Feixiao is so overpowered! I'm obsessed with this game! I told you. Babe, it won Best Mobile Game in 2023. I've got to tell all our friends about this. You're right. Hey, heroes. We're obsessed with this game called Honkai Star Rail. It's available to play across platforms and it's free to play. If you use the link in my description, you can download the game. And get 50 Stellar Jade for free. Good night, babe. Good night. What happened? Chelsea, I love you. Let's make this baby's life amazing. Trust me, I got this. But we've been working here for seven years. I have a baby coming. [Letter of Termination] [Dear Alan Chow] [Dear Daniil Boom] [EVICTION NOTICE] Alan, our rent is months past due. What are we going to do? I'll take care of everything. Trust me, I got this. [NOTICE TO VACATE] Hey, Alan. Are you okay? Yeah, Dad. Don't worry. Don't worry. I got this. Who are you? What do you want from us? Welcome to the game. There is only one winner. Win the prize or die. The first game is hide and seek. And it starts right now. Oh my god, is this a prank? Do you really think we're gonna play this? You must hide for exactly five minutes. If I find you, you will die. When I had nightmares as a kid. When I asked for help, my dad used to hold me like this. [GAME OVER!] Chelsea's here? You're here too? Yeah. But why did you join? I was sleeping and you were gone. And then I saw a masked man offering me money. And the next thing I remember I got hit in the head. And now I'm here. I did it for our baby. I did too. But...Who's taking care of him now? I don't know. [Baby] So we're all poor, huh? What brings you all here? My little sister, she's in the hospital. My family business went bankrupt during the recession. Looks like family brings us all together. -We're here for... My family is dirt poor and I'm tired of scrubbing dishes for a living. So yeah, I guess you could say family brings us together. This was my little sister's. May this doll always remind you Thank you. Guys, in this next game, let's protect each other no matter what. Family. [RED] [GREEN] [GREEN] [GREEN] [RED] I got this. The second game is dodgeball. Each team stands on cubes of their own color, and whoever gets knocked over dies. Green? Red? Wait, but we're on different teams. It's okay. Hey! [OMG] Oops! Yes! I can't do this! We are killing each other! The last ball is finished. Game complete. Lena, you can't run away. They'll electrocute you. This isn't a game. It's a murder house. My sister would never approve of this. Lena. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Lena. Game number three. Your mission is to wrestle each other. If you fall inside the ring, you will die. Our games are not jokes. If you continue to joke around, we will personally push you both into the ring. The match continues. Wrestle now. I can't do this. I can't kill. Especially you, Alan, my friend. You were there for me this entire time. You showed me true friendship. I'll sacrifice myself... For you, Alan. Nooooo! Nooooooo! Tomorrow is the last day of our challenge. Let's figure out a way to win this together. For the sake of our baby. I got this. Dear Dad, if I don't see you again, I'm sorry. I should have asked for your help when I needed it. Please help me. Your last challenge is very simple. Carve the shape from the Dalgona cookie. The first contestant to carve the cookie wins. You have five minutes. I guess nothing is as easy as it seems here. Every 30 seconds you'll receive an electric shock to the neck. If the shape inside breaks, you die. Alan... I think for once I got this. Our whole relationship you've always sacrificed for me. But it's my turn to pay you back. Only one person can survive in this game. I'll sacrifice myself for you. No, Chelsea. I love you, Alan. No, no! Noooooo! [BLOOD MONEY] Why isn't the money falling? What more do you want from us? My wife and friends are dead! Who are you? You assume we are the creators of this cruel game. The truth is, I'm just a normal man forced into this position. And I'm competing for the prize, just like you. And in this game, there's only one winner. [Letter of Termination] [Dear Daniil Boom] Dad? You asked for my help? Now I'm here. One day, you suddenly disappeared and I saw your baby alone in the street. I tried looking for you everywhere. Right before I gave up, I saw a note fly out the window of a certain warehouse, which I noticed many suspicious people working inside. It was from you. I came to save you. Family will always be there for you. You're right. Sacrifice is important, but you can always ask for help. We got this. This cruel money doesn't belong to me. Let's donate it to the families of the victims. [DONATING TO VICTIMS OF DEATH GAME] Click here to watch another episode of Alan's Universe.
