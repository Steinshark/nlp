We didn't have electricity - Some of the amazing things is that they're moving water in a very low technology way, using gravity. And it's really quite the [Dr. Webber] At the height a simple gravity fed system of through aqueducts provided all the water they needed but all the water they and cooking and everything else In fact, in the Roman cities, people had about the 400 liters per person per day, that we currently use in So in some ways, the high point of early For thousands of years, You could use an aqueduct to or use a power plant to to where the people are. Here at this one spot, we see and modernity all in one place. We also see the nexus all in one place. The magic of energy is There's the myth The unicorn has What was magical about the rid a stream of poison. The horn had magical capability Well, today we use energy So with energy, we can have the [Dr. Stillwell] If we we have water and energy at our for washing clothes, for clean drinking water, electrification of our lives.

All of this, all of where This is the old riverbed. They call this the Water Gate river met the land, and if you wanted to take you came down to a gate, a water gate like this. It's the only one At the start of the city of about a million people. By the 1850s, it had gone up to and the rubbish and the that just flowed flowed directly into - In the 1800s as London grew and more people came here, the water was so bad, a tavern like this because it was cleaner. - Of course we didn't know but there was something in water but beer didn't. That's because the fermentation kills those bacteria. So drinking beer was than drinking water. - In some ironic sense, some of the earliest ships they came with not water on and when they ran out of those they didn't know what to do that they could trust the North America that were and safe to drink because that So they had to land and they new fermented drinks in order to safe beverages because they <i> [Narrator] By the early 1900s, <i> industry to dump their waste <i> Almost all of the collected <i> was released as raw, <i> straight into rivers <i> causing a danger to public <i> To encourage action,</i> <i> informational films like <i> which presented electric <i> as the way to clean up [film narrator] Almost man settled near the water.

Cholera crossed the Atlantic and went up the and literally out [Dr. Webber] Then London. The waste had been just - The relationship between The belief was that cholera were spread by miasmas, and you could understand exactly because London absolutely stank. There was a doctor, who had a different idea. When he mapped deaths he found that they were with a particular pump, He had the parish - Dr. John Snow discovered and was ostracized, but was posthumously the link between cholera and waterborne transmission - In 1858, the conditions for what became known <i> [Narrator] In the <i> hot weather heated up the <i> and industrial runoff</i> <i> which was piled up along <i> and the stifling heat <i> The smell was so <i> had finally had enough.</i> <i> The government worked with <i> Joseph Bazalgette to <i> Pumping stations powered <i> were built to lift the <i> up into the pipes,</i> <i> and Bazalgette's plans <i> which closed in the sewers - London constructed hundreds to move waste from - Those intercepting sewers and fed it downstream, and from there into the and then right out into where and then it flowed out. [Dr. Webber] They built a or new sewers. In celebration of that, water fountains throughout to clean drinking water. So water fountains were built starting in 1859. This is the first Up to seven thousand It's not working today We have piped water to Water fountains like these water problem had been solved <i> [Narrator] Water is also <i> Many of us take clean <i> Ancient engineers solved <i> pure water from the <i> But as pollution increased, <i> make that water safe [Dr. Doyle] The role of always been for commerce. We had rivers that just landscape compared to a lot that the settlers were used to. When settlers first they moved as close to because that was the cheapest into and out of the landscape. As soon as the settlers showed that they did was they - So in the upper Midwest it was that would take grain and grind it into flour. - Then they look at the river &quot;There's a really &quot;If we can put a dam there, they'll come to the dam, Not only that, but just there's a whole bunch of boats The earliest form of was small grist mills that local grain and turning and that then became one of This power producing location becomes this entire <i> [Narrator] The energy of <i> to grind wheat into flour <i> Before this, humans required <i> to grind a bushel of <i> Horses could do the same <i> but a typical 18th century <i> could grind dozens of bushels <i> River were turned into <i> gradually modernizing economy</i> <i> and feed an expanding <i> The energy of flowing water <i> to manufacture goods and food,</i> <i> and then to transport those - The Mississippi River actually the heart of Minneapolis for everything for a We are at the very This area here was because of the water power here. It allowed them first then it powered the flour mills, and then hydroelectric. [Dr. Doyle] It was really when and moved into the There's no river like the and that was a completely It's just big. [Mike] Watch your step please. [Dr. Webber] Oh, see the You can see it. [Mike] You're right on [Dr. Webber] Yeah, I feel it. You can see how So if I were a pioneer and I'd want to build a mill, also. - That's exactly- - Find a way to harness - You've got natural power [Dr. Webber] Yeah. [Mike] And never ending, Back when they first got here, And then as people realized the and what they could do it, the city started growing. The reason this dam is so is having the dam here, and the power plant over there, the body of water above upper pool. Minneapolis gets all their from that upper pool. If something were Minneapolis would have to find - In many parts of the water was available from streams. In rural areas, certainly you and you wouldn't have access [Dr. Doyle] Hydropower has Hydropower itself is just and then using that to turn something else large. - So water from mechanical that's been around for Later on, in the late 1800s, for electrical power You can use flowing water to which spins magnets, which generates electricity. - Hydropower was not a but when electricity the need to generate electricity and combine hydropower was a big advancement. [Dr. Doyle] So hydroelectric It actually initially was one of the first dams on the Fox River where instead of producing it was instead the turning to produce electricity. - If you have a good some of the cheapest is by building big turbines to produce electric power. [dramatic music] [upbeat music] [Stevens] Welcome We have four water with the chance to learn in lots of different ways. You're an engineer, - Yes, I am. We're asking you to be a [Dr. Webber] Oh, okay, - Your goal is to divert the to get all of the water wheels at the same time. Keep all the - All right. I'll see if I can build a and create more water up top. All right. Now we got the turbines but then we lose some Then what are these for? Build another [Stevens] Uh oh. [Dr. Webber] Oh, we just So one of the things about a disaster when they collapse. Look, now these turned off Oh, I keep crashing my... [Stevens] Hey, all right. [Dr. Webber] I got all three although the turbines I still have a lot to go. Something like this could be to grind grain or to spin or to make hydroelectric power. - The development of the big thing that it was it allowed us instead of facility around gears, instead we had wires. And that allowed us to manufacturing facilities. So right off the bat, amount of flexibility at [Dr. Hunt] One of the electric installations in was at Niagara Falls That meant power around the was the cheapest in the world. It meant that many industries cheap electric power at Niagara Falls. Electric chemical industries, other electricity-intensive [Dr. Doyle] So we built these they were powering a lot Then you scale that up and electricity a long distance. We don't necessarily need to right next to a river. Now we can actually move those from rivers themselves, and that then starts to of an entire electric grid. The 1920s, especially, we're just starting to go [jazzy music] That was driven almost private sector. So the private sector was in ideal places. They were marketing that and there was this idea were exorbitant and that of the limited amount Tennessee Valley Authority to provide some kind What makes the TVA unusual So it produces hydropower, distributes that electricity, and then it markets The Tennessee Valley was in America. We weren't sure whether or by private electric companies, and FDR wanted to And so you put all those and the Tennessee Valley was for all three of those things. The experiment was: can we Can we, society at large, and give it electricity and come out of poverty simply by into that area? <i> [Narrator] Government entities <i> built dams across <i> harnessing the power of water.</i> <i> Dams reduced the catastrophic <i> made river transportation <i> and generated electric power,</i> <i> lifting people out of poverty - The build out of dams in had a massive effect on A lot of that also came from infrastructure with lines, but what that specifically for women, was from a lot of manual labor. Electrification meant with an electric pump, an electric stove. Eventually piped It's amazing what electricity from housework that [Dr. Doyle] And as women became from the tedious tasks that manual effort, they could They could join the workforce. They could accumulate wealth. [TV commercial] Employees find as well as men, some jobs better. - So we see the rise of and additional freedoms [announcer] Day and night, the dams work for the people. Power for the factories. Power for new industry. Power to run a turning out aircraft, tractors, textiles, engines, shoes, fertilizer, aluminum. Cheap and abundant power to - When we look back on it, of industry that is still based and that's a remnant of the cheap electricity. So you not only have the bomb Oak Ridge National Lab, of the automobile industry eastern part of the rather than in Detroit. And one of the draws to that - The constructing of dams not involving electricity. They were typically United States as flood as a water supply In a lot of the large have in the United States, power is actually an [Dr. Doyle] Dams have always The way that politicians and consolidate power. - Politicians historically because there's a lot of The construction is expensive, and a certain amount of to other people involved. The contractors for Mansfield Dam, which holds Brown and Root, were big Lyndon Johnson's campaigns, and so he had an Johnson would secure basically federally to finance the construction. Brown and Root would They would make Some of the money would go campaign funds. Then, how would the to pay off the loans? Lyndon Johnson organized which would then purchase the and also endear Lyndon Johnson central Texas because he So it makes a very nice, of people getting and some of those benefits for the politicians who Who are the losers? Well, the people who lived in They get flooded out. Most famous examples of in the Tennessee Valley. [Dr. Doyle] Every time we build In this particular area, the the Tennessee Valley is in All of those are gone. - Those lands are often from from rural populations that on the land and from that have had land that are now flooded [Dr. Hunt] There are also I think those have been more of the Northwest, where the has cut into, or even There are trade offs, who's ox is getting gored? Who's losing and Hydroelectric projects are civil engineering projects ever In many instances, I think but I think there are people - We're often focused on and other issues that they're on the outside of our goal and so a does suffer in response [Dr. Sedlak] Unless you lived in of this sewage made it in the city because of the untreated sewage into rivers. The Potomac is impossible The Great Lakes are dying. All of the great rivers of and western Europe are [Dr. Gleick] The Cuyahoga example of that. In the 1960s, caught fire that we were dumping [Dr. Sedlak] It wasn't the first caught on fire. It caught on fire many - Really in the 1960s was being an asset and started I mean, it's not just the in Ohio. I mean, the entire Merrimack was a cesspool. In the southwest, the and in the upper midwest they were just vile And in the southeast, they from all of the agriculture. So they were just nasty. It wasn't fun to be in a river by the time you got into - It seems the environmental series of things that So in the environmental these were big moments, and to take action. - I think people were yes, it's great to live but at some point, rivers we should be able to have without fear that they're with all kinds of and things like. That was the roots of [Dr. Stillwell] The Clean by President Nixon. He thought it would Fortunately, Nixon was and municipalities led the to treat waste and to treat - Starting in the early 1970s, in building or upgrading and turned our rivers from places that no to places where now it was and to swim. - Those two laws, the and the Safe Drinking are the foundational of the United States and to providing safe water natural ecosystems today. [Dr. Doyle] A couple of years Endangered Species Act and to start protecting all these all of these other acts, the Natural Environmental things followed up, all from [Dr. Stillwell] Rivers and lakes improved in quality. Of course, there's Not all of the waterways are swimmable and fishable. But we're making progress. [dramatic music] [Dr. Gleick] Water is connected Production of food, production human health, ecosystem health, especially in the 20th century, those issues are related, but - Growing populations are pushing us to a point with imported water anymore. And so if we need we have to get creative. [Dr. Gleick] Water is a production of the energy We use a tremendous and in the 21st century, our resources in a we have to manage those as a whole, rather than as - Economic development I mean, that's just kind of any economic development. I think it's a How much pollution or how much are we willing to take for the [Dr. Gleick] One of the more and more about is because we're reaching what We're actually finally and non-renewable and because of these limits, we're increasingly aware modern water system. - We've found ways to become we use water, but we're going And going further is going water recycling and and possible even desalination. [thunder and pouring rain] - Great day for a walking tour, - It is, it is. - So I carry my umbrella but women carry it further - It's more elegant that way? [Dr. Webber] How long have Are you from Singapore? - You're a native, [Dr. Webber] But Singapore also around the world come to. So there's Malay, Chinese, Are those the main ones? - Yeah, those are the - Maybe that's the example of should do it. It's something we got to be <i> [Narrator] Since 1980, <i> has nearly doubled and <i> Today, Singapore is a global <i> with a population approaching <i> As an island nation, <i> very serious about solving <i> With only a small amount of <i> to all of the water they need,</i> <i> but they have begun <i> by using modern energy.</i> <i> Singapore is surrounded <i> and their water supply <i> from the oceans, <i> and also by reclamation,</i> <i> which means treating sewage <i> to make it safe to drink.</i> <i> Both of these processes are <i> but require a large amount <i> [Narrator] In Singapore, <i> down the drain and is flushed <i> is now being treated until it <i> This has sometimes been <i> [Narrator] The challenges <i> everywhere in the world.</i> <i> For national security reasons, <i> cannot rely on its neighbors <i> So Israel has turned to a <i> using less water, and <i> to solve their water problems.</i> - Safety first, right? - Safety first. - Desalination after. - Yeah.

We trust the water that comes because of the energy we've and to disinfect it And we trust that when the lights will come on, but we've kind of - Part of the challenge in is that we have to that we didn't previously We could build a power plant anywhere we want and not worry That's no longer true. In more and more places, water in decisions about - One of the issues is, what is at any particular place as There really are solutions to the regional circumstances, and that's within the and that's between countries. [Dr. Adar] There is a clear link It's across border. It is a resource. It is not just luxury. It is a basic, basic resource and it has to be coordinated [Dr. Gleick] I think we know all of the water challenges The truth is, we waste a huge already spend a lot of energy and treating and distributing, Let's think about sources of about as liabilities, desalination potentially if and energy hurdles. Capturing more storm water So if we do all those things, I think that leads us to a [Dr. Webber] Those who have environmental impact of But those who don't have So we have to simultaneously access while reducing the people who do have access.
