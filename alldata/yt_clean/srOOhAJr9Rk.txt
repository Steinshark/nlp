- Well, guys, the dude is lying low in the burrow, Is this guy even stirring? - Yeah, that's him. - He's pretending to be dead, we're throwing a grenade at him. He's, like, injured. Got him, got him! Something's on fire. - Perfect! - 300 (injured) Oh, his pants are starting to catch fire. He's convulsing, crawling out of the burrow. - Oh, he's out, damn, end him! - And then our tigers go - pow-pow-pow-pam. That's it, they're shooting. - That's it, 200. (dead) - Awesome, - That's it, watch. - Well done. We've fine-tuned him. Greetings comrades! I must have already annoyed those who constantly watch us with this. However, it's possible that we have newcomers observing us, thus I feel compelled to address them. My call sign is Abdullah. I'm the commander of the Terra unit. Terra is currently operating in the Bahmut direction as part of the Third Separate Assault Brigade. Two things. First: Video about the battles for the Road of Life in Bakhmut. There, the russians die. That's why some footage is censored. If you're interested in watching the video censored, feel free to join our Telegram channel. There it will be uncensored. And secondly, perhaps a more serious matter. Terra is assembling 100 FPV kamikaze drones for use during offensive operations in the Bahmut direction. The link for the fundraising is pinned in the video description. We also have Patreon and a Telegram channel. Donate, join us, and help us share the message of the video. Only together will we achieve victory. Glory to Ukraine! [4 A.M. ARRIVED AT POSITION. UNFOLDING] [4 A.M. ARRIVED AT POSITION. UNFOLDING] - Lets start. The target can already be seen. -Taking off. - We observe, observe. - Plus. - Just hope he doesn't shoot us down. - Kolya, can you come to me and show me the target for dropping? - Somewhere around here? - Be ready to throw. We need it there. - Yes, right above ***. Initiating drop. - Be careful, our forces are nearby. - Confirmed, our infantry is clearly discernible from the enemy's. - Look, our infantry has moved beyond the road, rolled over. Only the enemy will be present there. Damn it, I'll be delivering a strike in a minute, confirm my hit, please. - Repeat, repeat. - Damn! - Close. - Close. - Packet, this is Abdullah. Just dropped on ***. Slightly missed. Packet, how do you receive me? - Taxi driver, what's the problem? [DRONE LOSS. ENEMY EW OPERATING] [DRONE LOSS. ENEMY EW OPERATING] [DRONE LOSS. ENEMY EW OPERATING] - What's the problem? - Lost signal. - You, run to him with the &quot;Krapiva&quot; system Run to him with the &quot;Krapiva&quot; system immediately. To help him orient himself as soon as it appears. Did you find it? - No. - Shortly, dropped it, flew back, and just at a maximum of 35 meters. - Alright. Take a break. We'll throw when they engage with our infantry. When they're not in contact, they can disperse, strike back, do whatever they want. Call Zheludy, and go get 4 Mavic units from him. Hey, do we have any drops? [TERRA BEGGING] - We didn't calculate enough Mavic drones and drops. Just a universal drop, with a return feature. - We have it, but it's just broken. - Well, for 3. - For what? - Do you need for 3? - I need it for a bomb. A 40mm one. - Ah - Maybe universal one or... No? - No. - Nothing. We flew.... At what altitude were you flying just now? - Well, we're throwers now. We're actually adjusters, but today we are throwers. In general we worked in Kherson with the 28th and Paladin self-propelled artillery units for about 4 months. We worked with all types of artillery. For a very long time, about 4 months. They worked here, well, with all types of artillery. With M777 howitzers and Pion self-propelled artillery units. But here, there are no ammo supplies, so we're like, let's strike, let's throw. - Are you flying the second one or which one now? - Mavic? Third.. A couple of them already left, unfortunately. - Today? - Yes, all this drone dropping work is costly in terms of Mavic units. Well, in terms of equipment. - Well, yes. If you have the possibility to have a reserve of 10-15, then it makes sense, yes. But still, we bought Mavic units for 64,000 hryvnias. But it's still cheaper. If you hit, it's cheaper than warming up the line. No, well, people's lives are priceless. In reality, Mavic units are trivial; they're not that important. If they're available. Pashtet - Abdullah. Let's go FPV - Buddy, we see a lot of enemies at the intersection *** There are three on one side and four on the other. - Plus. I already have 2 groups working at those coordinates. [STRIKE WITH FPV KAMIKAZE DRONE] Yes, he's waiting for satellites, flying with FPV right now. Pashtet-Abdullah. The devil confirmed your hit with the FPV. Good hit. Do it again. Okay, we need to go to ***. What are we ready for? Satellite tracking the drones? - Yes. Sashka, get the drone ready for takeoff. - Let's go! - Vzh. - Wow. Some sort of diabolical contraption. The enemies are feigning again, observe. Look, they're feigning. Playing dead. They're actually alive. Damn, the Mavic just went over them, I don't know how many meters and dropped two. Yeah, about twenty meters. It flew over and dropped two while moving. [ACCOMPANYING ATTACK AIRCRAFT] So it's the infantry from GUR. - There they are. Are our guys already at the intersection? - Yes. I don't see any moving infantry, but they're hiding. - I see one over there. - I also see. - Good. Good-good. The first one hit well. - Yeah. - He's holding his head. Yes. - Well, show me, show me. - It's not that simple. Come on, come on, buddy. Come on, come on. - Did 3x3 go? - Yes. He climbed into a pit. Well, he climbed into a pit, holding his head. - Injured, yes? - Yes, yes, he climbed into a pit. He climbed to the corpse. Ah, he's undressing. Taking off his gloves. Yes, he's going to treat himself. Taking off his gloves.. - Take a grenade and throw it at him again. - Let me... - We've hit the enemy hard. - Yes, yes. He's in the pit. Good. Well, if we throw a grenade at him now, that'll be it. - Good evening. Listen, he's no longer a fighter, our Rexes can... - Yes, get him out of there and ask... - Ask why he came. - On what ground? Listen, maybe he's done for. No, no. applies a tourniquet. Hand now. Yes, hand now. Our infantry is approaching him, look. He's done for now. [INFANTRY BATTLE. ASSAULT] - Look. - Do you see them? - Yes, they are out. - Yeah, he's lying with a grenade. Can you descend very low and throw a grenade at him? - No, I might hit our own. - Alright, alright. No, it's too close. - Too close. - Let it be. He's throwing a grenade at him. Awesome, go for it. Grenade. - Grenade. He threw it. - No, he didn't throw it, no. Well, he threw it in front of himself. Bad for him. 200? (dead) - No, alive. He's deflecting the grenade, damn it. - Not good. They'll hold him back. If our guys move away, throw a grenade at him. Can you do it carefully? - Yes. - Come on, come on. Throw a grenade at him. Everything is fine. - Loads another grenade. - We can't fly off now. Change course, we will throw it. Is that a grenade or a bomb? - Well, now this is dangerous. Hit! - Wait. No, didn't hit. This is a belated shot. Well done, well done. He's been hammered. Pushed him there into the burrow. The guys, I think, will dig him out. Now they are bringing him another grenade. All-all. Now he will be dead. - Did they end him? - Right now... yes! All set. Oh oh oh. Impressive.Pavel, things are getting intense here. - Well, there is no good defeat, But we captured how our tigers fought the enemy. Wow, it's intense over there. They managed to take him down in the end. And there's another guy sitting in a pit, he's probably eating He's probably restoring his health. - Kolya, how's the situation there? - Yes, according to the situation. - Did the Tigers pass by a little bit? - No, they haven't reached him yet. There's another pit further ahead. I'll show you the location now. Find this client of ours, our infantry. Can you see our infantry? And then this client, and then you lead along the trench line, and there's a dude lying there... ...he has a little dugout for a lying position. He's moving there. Maybe this one? Here it is. One of these two. This one. - Is this one moving? - Yes, that's him. Our infantry is far away, we can safely throw out at him. Keep an eye on it too. They reached him earlier, they will deal with him for some time. [DROP. ANOTHER ENEMY 300 (injured)] [DROP. ANOTHER ENEMY 300 (injured)] [DROP. ANOTHER ENEMY 300 (injured)] [DROP. ANOTHER ENEMY 300] Hit! - Got him! Something's on fire. - Cool. 300, 300. (injured) Not now. - Oh, legs, legs,dude. - He does not like. -He does not like it. Oh, he crawled out. - Finish him! - That's excellent. - That`s it, hiting. 200! (dead) Super! Yeah, well done. Finished him off. Otherwise, he would have died there. Jora, you're amazing. Well done. Now the real work has begun. Some connection has been restored. - No, but we helped a lot with that twice. We hammered the enemy... - And drove him into that pit. He was walking back and forth. - And he sat in the pit, and started bandaging himself. But they didn't let him come out. - It's just beautiful. It's top-notch. - In short guys... The guy is lying in the pit, pretending to be dead. We throw fragmentation grenade at him, he is 300 His sides start burning, his pants catch fire, he convulses, climbs out of the pit, and then our tigers him ... bam-bam-bam, he jumps back into the pit, the tigers throw a grenade at him, and it's over. - Is it cumulative? - These two little ones . - Maybe it pierced him with a cumulative. If it hit him. - Not him. He's in the pit, it hit nearby. - Jora, the infantry asks us to continue.. They say we're helping a lot.. - They survived from grenade, just great. - You see, he some kind of rex. - He's already the 300th one, wounded, still fighting back. Well, on the other hand, it could be a self-preservation instinct. He knows they will capture him, he already knew... - No, listen, there are REXes, don't think it's just a critical there. I've never been in such a situation before, so it's unknown to me. I hope I never will. - Yes Yes. God forbid, as they say. - Oh, I see enemy. - You see? - There it is, yes. Moving. - Good. Our infantry has paused a little. Moves? - Yes. - Look, it's sitting in the pit. And do you see the hand? - Yes, you see, something is placed in front of the pit. - Well, that's nothing to worry about. They're asking him to come out of the pit. Come out of the pit. Oh oh oh! [SNIPER SHOT] [SNIPER SHOT] - Look, there it is. A corpse. - Died for the homeland. Another one was directly thrown into the pit. [ALL AMMO EXPENDED. EVACUATION] BM-21 MLRS &quot;Grad&quot;? - Yes. - No. - Is this a hit? - Yes. - Anyway, we'll go through this... - The old way. - No, through the highway. - As they say, let's sum up the results. [CONCLUSION] We hit the russians. - Helped the infantry. - We helped the infantry. And lost a bunch of drones.
