Sans: It's a beautiful day outside, birds are singing, flowers are blooming. On days like this, kids like you, should be burning in Hell! Chara: One step left now, it's almost time. Show you what my Determination has still left for you to get back to. You should prepare to just die!!! Chara: Like all your friends, you'll have a really good time Sans (At same time): Or else, friend, you're gonna have a bad time... Sans: But kids like you don't play by the rules, and guys like me, it ain't easy to be played for fools, So let's go, let the room get chiller, Sans: Let's go, dirty brother killer Chara (At same time): Let's go, just another killer Frisk: Go ahead and just hit me since you're able. We know my Determination is unstable. I'm not even mad because I keep on dying, but I don't even know why I'm trying. Sans: You're not gonna win, we'll be here together, fighting in this judgement hall forever. And I know you just reset each time I beat ya' but I'll always be right back here to meet ya'. I know you're made o-o-o-o-of, L.O-O-O-O-O.V.E., L.O-O-O-O-O.V.E. Chara and Sans: L.O-O-O-O-O.V.E., L.O-O-O-O-O.V.E., L.O-O-O-O-O.V.E. Frisk: I know who you are, you remember who I am. We knew that once in a timeline, we had grown to be good friends.... And yet I killed your brother, without giving him a chance. Every time you throw me down, I hope you kill me once again.... Chara: Go ahead, kill me again, I see you're able, but inside you know the end can't be evaded. You think I might decide to stop if you stay patient, but I am getting you with my Determination!! Frisk: This isn't what I want, yet it's what I asked for. Curiosity over all my morals... I took away our perfect, happy ending. Resetting the world despite the warnings.... Right now I'm made o-o-o-o-of... L.O-O-O-O-O.V.E., o-o-o-o-oh Chara, Frisk, and Sans: L.O-O-O-O-O.V.E., L.O-O-O-O-O.V.E., L.O-O-O-O-O.V.E.. *Instrumental* Chara: &quot;This is where it stops, this is where it ends.&quot; Sans: If you want to get past me, well, you better try again. Chara: But even if I hear you, I won't give up my attack. Sans: Do you just like the feeling of your sins crawling on your back? Frisk: So go ahead and hit me, since your able. All the sin that I can feel is unbearable....! If I could only hit you once, it would be over, but the consequences last forever....! Chara: Why not let me win? You can't dodge forever! Even if the pain is more fun together! You know I will just reset and come back newer, and with every try I'm getting even faster than you are! I am made o-o-o-o-o-of, L.O-O-O-O-O.V.E., o-o-o-o-oh Chara, Frisk, and Sans: L.O-O-O-O-O.V.E., L.O-O-O-O-O.V.E., L.O-O-O-O-O.V.E. *Instrumental* Sans: Hehehehehehe... *Instrumental* Sans: This is where it stops, this is where it ends. Chara: You keep telling me those words and hope that I would understand. Sans: But no matter how I stall you, you don't give up your attack. Chara: Can you just not see the truth or can you not see what this all meant? Sans: Go ahead and try to hit me if you're able, you should know by now that Mercy's off the table. Think that you can try to spare me like I'm some pawn? Well, you didn't spare my brother, so GET DUNKED ON! Frisk: The flowers are in bloom as the birds will tell, it's a beautiful day to be burning in Hell! You gave me advice. Chara: You should be dying! Sans: I am Determination! Frisk, Chara, and Sans: I am made/I'm entirely made/I know you're made o-o-o-o-of, L.O-O-O-O-O.V.E., L.O-O-O-O-O.V.E. Sans: But I think I'm stronger than you! Chara and Frisk: L.O-O-O-O-O.V.E., L.O-O-O-O-O.V.E., o-o-o-o-oh Chara: I am stronger than you! Chara and Frisk: L.O-O-O-O-O.V.E., L.O-O-O-O-O.V.E., o-o-o-o-oh Frisk: But I'll give up for you Chara and Frisk: O-o-o-o-oh Chara: O-o-o-o-oh, O-o-o-o-oh Flowey: Hmm... That's a WONDERFUL idea!
