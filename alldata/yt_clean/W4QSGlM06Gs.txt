Hey, it's me, Destin. Goggle up because science This is my buddy John Henry. Way back before, Smarter Every it was just a couple dudes Just a couple of guys having fun. That's what we're going to do today. A long time ago, we made this video If you want to find it, But it doesn't have a smarter We figured out how to strike Three, two, one. Yeah!!!! Yeah!!!! YES!!! [J] We have done it. We have done it! That was such a big deal. [J] That was epic. [D] For us, that was the biggest thing So things have changed since then. Smarter Every Day has become a thing. We've got new tools. Like, for example, I really want to see a bullet fly by here on a video and strike I think that would be amazing. And there's a couple of things Number one, you can't get strike anywhere matches like you used We did it with red And here, you want to try one? [D] So I got these at an antique I tried to find some other ones I thought the blue would be cool, though. Ohio blue tip don't work. But the green tip, the diamond This is the only type of strike anywhere It's made by diamond. And I think the reason they don't make as this is because of Department Now you can see on the end of a strike of something and then If I figure it out, I'll put We have to get the bullet to fly in and just nick the top What worked? Do you remember, John? that was one thing. I think we use the short rifle [D] So the short rifle is what we [J] Yes. [D] We've got this little holder that we And this is what it looks like when [J] I don't think we've used It's still set up the exact same, though. [D] This was our left and right. [D] That was how we did elevation. [J] I don't know if we're missing [D] Yeah, we're missing a pin. That pin right there. You know what would work well there? [J] Redneck ingenuity. [D] That's right. It's time. There we go. [J] That's it. [D] I would tell you what to do, but you know, with an old friend like John He just knows what to do. Like, I turn around and he's And he's lining it in on the matches John just gets stuff done You'll notice that there's flickering We have this light right here. It's called a Nanlux light. I'm very excited they sent this to me. And so this is a non Thank you, John. And you can see that everything So we're going to get the shot framed, get everything figured out, I'm so excited. [D] Let's do it. This will be fun. [J] Our piggies are a little [D] I think they are. [J] I'll let you know when I'm hot. [J] All right, we're hot. [D] Ready for the count? You ready? Okay, tell me when it's clear. [J] Clear. [D] Weapon clear. [J] We're clear. [D] All right, so we're too far to the left Would you say too low? [D] I think we need a calibrated bump, Ready? Watch it. [D] Is that it? [D] We could stick one in the middle, [D] Should I just do that? I'm ready when you are. [D] Three, two, one, fire. I forgot to put my left earplug in. So we're still low, I bet. Okay. I saw a spark. [J] Yeah, about last match. [D] So the fire was there, but then it I'm so happy [J] What do you think about this, none of these matches are straight. Leaving our stand where it sits [D] Oh, clever Henry. So, you're saying you can push them down out of the way and then you [J] Exactly. [D] My theory is that the blast I think we put a piece of cardboard up and strip the smoke, [J] So punch about a quarter size hole in it. [D] The bullet goes through and then all that blast doesn't Okay, so our problem This little cardboard smoke stripper technique was something I had done Three, two, one, fire. [J] All right! Okay, we're in business. We've got fire. [D] We've made fire! All right, let's look at the slow mo. [J] Man, that's awesome. [D] Okay, so the stripper worked. [J] It worked. [J] I did. [D] I guess so, [J] That ignited the fire in me. [Both laughing] [J] As soon as we put up the cardboard, all the air pressure [D] Oh, you can actually see it. It's a bunch of soot and smoke. We have to make it beautiful. [J] We have to. [D] So the first shots, we had the four Right? We have a macro lens and we So that means we're not going So what do you think we should do? I mean, I think the obvious thing is we should cram all the matches And we should try to engage just fewer We had a laser over here and we And we just raised up these matches until the very tip of the match You would think that would work, right? Let's see what happens. Test number five in three, two, one, fire. I gotta put hearing [Destin laughing] Okay, this will be shot six Too low. [J] All right, let's try again. Three, two, one, fire. [J] That was real high. [D] Very high. One, fire. Fire. High again. Go. Too much. What? Ooh. blow the matches away because we were firing too high and we When we finally did make fire, It had to do with the Shot 14. Three, two, one, fire. [J] Got it! [D] Boom. Got two of them. The question is, did it light the second You know what I mean? So on that shot a match, But on the next shot, See if you can figure it out. Three, two, one, fire. All right. So, obviously, we have the match But this was also the moment where we a level of precision we're When we line in the matches with the laser of the laser beam itself, But if you look at the image on the side with a macro lens, You can see that these Okay, life lesson time. Have you ever been trying to do something And somebody else, in my case, physics Sometimes our best We just kind of automatically go for the bare minimum required When we know that we can go full send, we can just go all the way We thought we were getting it right, This bullet was not consistently flying on the flight path of the laser, So we had two issues going on, We eventually called it a night and decided to sleep on it And when we came in in the morning, when we were loading the bullets, and Our solution to this was to get a vise and a two, four, and we rested the barrel of the gun We also decided to tighten up the camera view to one match And that was it. and we could slowly raise Okay, now we're getting serious. We have a height indicator, and we're 42.5. Know what's getting real? When you add a new column to your Three, two, one, fire. All right, see what we got. Dude. Okay, so that's 42.55 I guess we go 42. 43 mm? 43 mm high. Three, two, one, fire. Dude, man, that's crazy. I feel like we're being [J] I think so. [D] 43.43 mm In three, two, one fire. Fire!! [J] There we go. [J] We got it. All right. Okay. We were trying to get the most beautiful shot possible, to try to figure out what would After we took this shot, we figured out that the bullet was flying so we made the adjustments, and then we We shot several times to figure And you can actually see the gunpowder that's flying out before We captured this video So we finally dialed it in, and we got But I wanted to go faster. This next shot, 380,000 frames per second. And then if you look in the bottom right of the picture here, You'll see where we moved the camera around, and we got some Check this out. And as beautiful as all these videos are, It's a very tight shot And you can just see the fire starting to I think this shot is awesome. I want to do something weird. [J] What's that? Can we shoot a match out of the rifle? [J] Of course [D] We can. Let's just do it. [J] So stick it in the hole and put [D] Yeah. [J] Think you light a match off of a match? [D] We give it one go. [D] One go. Our one and only attempt [J] Lighting a match with a match. [D] It's free, and it's rad. Those are the two reasons why you should which is remote control software, from any other computer or even This is my editing machine. It's a 4k processing capable computer. That's awesome. But I have 120 slow motion files that I have to process in order to upload And I know it just looks like I upload to this desk in this, like, and I have to make sure it doesn't Any desk changed my life, and make sure that everything And it's huge. If you want to control a computer from another location, Go to anydesk.com/smarter I'm going to show you My family went to a lake All the families went in together, and we rented a lake house so that we And I was able to go. I wasn't chained here And I want to share with you My son's out there on a paddle board, way out there, and I'm monitoring Almost 10 hours of rendering left. I can check things out while I'm What's up, dweebuses? I found a rock that I can't break. Show me. It didn't break. Yours broke. It's so weird. Like this one... Yeah, this one breaks, Watch. I'm going to roll it off a cliff! [D] So now I get to know about rocks instead The controls are pretty sweet. You just swipe in from the side You can go to multiple monitors, You can go to keyboard or you Anydesk.com/smarter if you want to try Their business model is if you use it And if you have a business, So they're just really cool. Like, it's free. And it helps me learn which rocks break meaning I get to spend more time with So go check it out. I'd be grateful if you would do that. That helps anydesk know that you like Smarter Every Day and you want So check it out, I'd be grateful. All right, let's go see what [J] Match in the barrel, [D] Alright. [J] All right, we're ready. Three, two. Oh, wait wait wait three, two, one. Fire. Shut up!! [J] Are you kidding?!? There's no way. There's no way. Got to see that. [General atmosphere of disbelief} NUH uh! Shut up, John Henry. [J] {Exclaiming in Redneck Jubilation} Are you kidding? What is happening?!?! [J] The bullet pushed the match, all the way through, that is wild. [J] Look at that. [Destin laughing] [J] There's no way. [D] And then it lit it, dude!! [J] That's incredible. [D] What? I forgot how to engineer. Okay. A bullet, carrying a match, striking, a match This match is just like &quot;Hey Man&quot; [J] Gah!.... that's insane. [D] All right, so this is going to actually, [J] Look at that! [D] [Brain leaves body] [J] That is crazy! I never would have thought that the match So I thought about how to end this video, The fact that we were lighting matches It's not about what we were doing. That doesn't matter at all. It's the fact that we were doing If you have a friend in your life and you're kind of on the fence whether do you want to go do this Do it like, invest in the friendship, My heart is full because this was a blast. I know this kind of sounds dumb, but I want to thank you for hanging out I don't know you, you don't know me, And we've been doing it for years, so I'm grateful that you want to just So thanks for watching this video. If you want to be notified next time we goof off in the garage, You can go check it out at an email next time it's time for us I have a list of things I found That's crazy. If you want to check that out, I'll put We'll go through that frame by frame. I saw some weird stuff and I want Also, a big thanks to everybody When you do that, that supports That's it. You're getting Smarter Every Day. Bye. Three, two, one, fire. [J] That's it. Yes. I hurt my hand when I hit my hand. [Both laughing] It hurts a lot. I tried to hit there and I hit there. [J] I broke my own hand
