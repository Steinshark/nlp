IT IS HEADING UPWARD INTO ORBIT. WITH ELON MUSK AND A NUMBER OF WATCH THIS IN ACTION. PRESIDENT-ELECT WITH HIS CLOSE EXECUTIVE AND AMERICA'S RICHEST JUST A FEW NIGHTS AFTER THEY GARDEN TO WATCH THE UFC FIGHT, EXPECTED TO BE A HISTORIC BLOOMBERG TV AND YOUTUBE, WE PRESIDENT-ELECT. THE ROCKET REACH ITS HIGHEST LAST TEST FLIGHT IT WAS 93 EXPECTED TO DUPLICATE THAT AS BOOSTER CUP BY THE CHOPSTICKS. CALLED THE HOT STAGING PORTION FOR ACTUAL SEPARATION. BE CUT OFF AND THIS IS A AS THEY START TO FLIP THE KAILEY: LISTEN TO THE COMMENTARY OF THE STARSHIP MOVING ON AND THE JOURNEY BACK TO EARTH AS IT DISSENT INTO THE MECHANICAL EINHORN WHO IS WATCHING AND HOW CRITICAL ARE THE NEXT FEW BOOSTER TRIES TO MAKE ANOTHER EARTH? BRUCE: SOON. STAGING JETTISON. PART OF THE ROCKET, THE BOOSTER THIS IS SOMETHING OVER THE GET RID OF. INTO THE BOOSTER. JETTISON THAT.

COUPLE OF MINUTES IS AN ATTEMPT THE HEAVY BOOSTER WITH THE TELL US ABOUT THE STAKES AND BECAUSE SPACEX MADE IT LOOK THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT WAS THEY WERE ABLE TO CATCH THE THE BOOSTER IS MORE POWERFUL ROCKETS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE THEY WERE ABLE TO CATCH THE RECOVER IT INTACT AND REFURBISH THE DISRUPTIVE THING ABOUT THE REUSABLE AND IT WILL COSTS. SHUTTLE. WHAT IT CAN DO, IT WILL BE MORE ORBIT UNLIKE THE SPACE SHUTTLE. WE WILL WATCH THE STARSHIP THE CONTROL SURFACES AND HEAT IT SHOULD SURVIVE REENTRY WITH TIME, IT WILL DO THE FLIP AND CAPTURED. THIS IS EXCITING. KAILEY: BLOOMBERG TERMINAL THAT SPACEX SUPER HEAVY MID AIR BOOSTER IT DID HAPPEN SUCCESSFULLY IN COP BETWEEN THE CHOPSTICKS BUT THE MIDAIR BOOSTER CATCH. I WOULD IMAGINE THESE THINGS EXECUTE EVEN UNDER PERFECT WHAT DOES IT SIGNAL TO YOU? PARAMETERS HAVE TO BE MET FOR ONE OR MORE OF THOSE PARAMETERS I'M HEARING FROM YOU RIGHT NOW ATTEMPT TO CATCH IT, WHICH GULF OF MEXICO. IN SEEING WHAT THE STARSHIP CHILLED PROBLEMS WORKED OUT AND ADVANCING AS THEY GO FLIGHT NUMBER SIX AND THEY'VE SUCCESS WITH EACH FLIGHT. SEE THEM AT THE BOOSTER. JOE: LET'S LISTEN TO CONTROL. &gt;&gt; THERE ARE FOUR HYPERSONIC JOE: CLOSER TO THE GROUND AND A HORIZON, NOT EXPECTED TO BE GULF OF MEXICO. ON THE CHOPSTICKS. THAT DOES NOT MEAN MISSION STILL HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO ADD IMPORTANT CONTEXT, AS LESS TIME WITH THE CATCHING OF IT WAS DIFFICULT. VERY CLOSE TO NOT WORKING OUT THE FACT THAT THEY DID NOT INDICATION OF HOW DIFFICULT IMPRESSIVE THE PERFORMANCE WAS CERTAINLY I THINK A LOT OF US INCLUDING PERHAPS THE MENTIONED WHO IS THERE TO FORMED A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP MUSK. LEROY I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO STARSHIP SYSTEM IN PART BECAUSE IN FUTURE ENDEAVORS INCLUDING HOW CONCERNED SHOULD WE BE THE INCOMING PRESIDENT OF THE MUSK WILL HAVE IN AN ADVISOR IN CONSIDERING HE IS A BIG AS FAR AS GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS PRE-PAYMENTS. IT REALLY WASN'T A CONTRACT PER DELIVERY. THEY HAVE A CONTRACT TO HELP THERE IS A QUESTION OF CONFLICT BE WORKED OUT, WITH THE NUANCES. IF YOU'RE JUST JOINING US, A YOU THE SIXTH TEST FLIGHT OF GONE THROUGH A LAUNCH THAT WAS HEAVY BOOSTER IS IN THE WATER OPPOSED TO ACHIEVING THE TEST FLIGHT FIVE. BLOOMBERG TV AND YOUTUBE SEE RED HAT TALKING TO ELON MUSK HAPPENING AS THEY LOOK OVER THE WENDY BENJAMINSON IS WITH US IN AT ALL OF THIS UNFOLD. POLITICS AND IMPACT OF THE OF THE ELECTION AND THE ROLE ADMINISTRATION. WENDY: THIS IS SORT OF THE BROMANCE THE UFC FIGHT TOGETHER AND NOW SEE THE LAUNCH. THEY HAVE TOGETHER LATELY IN HAVING FUN TOGETHER THIS WEEK, MUSK IS ACTING ALMOST AS A SHADOW VICE PRESIDENT, OR NOT A VICE PRESIDENT TO TRUMP. GOVERNMENT IN THE LAST COUPLE KAILEY: DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT BE PART OF THE U.S. ADVISORY CAPACITY. THAT AS WE DISCUSS THE OTHER OPERATORS IN THE GAME, WE WRONG WITH BOEING AND SPACEX ASTRONAUTS HOME FROM THE BLUE ORIGIN IS HERE AS WELL. RACE AT THIS TIME. BRUCE: BLUE ORIGIN IS TRYING TO CATCH THEY HOPE TO LAUNCH SOON. BUT RIGHT NOW SPACEX IS THE THEY OPERATE THE MOST ADVANCED COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK, WELL ARE TESTING OUT THE WORLD'S THE FACT THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO CHOPSTICKS I THINK IT IS SPACEX SAID JUST LAST WEEK THE HUNDREDS OF TIMES OVER THE NEXT BEING ABLE TO CATCH THE ROCKET LAND, THE BOOSTER PART OF THE ORDER TO HAVE THE FAST NUMBER OF LAUNCHES. THE FACT THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO TIME IS A SETBACK. BIG OF A SETBACK IT IS BUT BETTER FOR THEM IF THEY HAD HAVE IT RETURN ON LAND. JOE: STRANDED AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEROY, I WONDER YOUR THOUGHTS BETWEEN SPACEX AND BOEING. IN SPACE? LEROY: THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS THAT SPACE DIVISION. OUT OF COMMERCIAL AIR PLAYS AND FOCUSING ON THAT, PERHAPS THE ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S A BIG AND COMMERCIAL SPACE AND WE NASA WOULD PREFER TO HAVE TWO SPACEX HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL FALTERED SEVERAL TIMES, STRANDED ASTRONAUTS ON THE ISS COME BACK ON A SPACEX VEHICLE. AND COME BACK TO THEIR MORE ABOUT ENGINEERING AND CENTS. MORE ADVANCED AND THE FACT THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T CATCH STARSHIP, THE HEAT SHIELD AND SUCCESSFUL BUT THAT'S THE NEXT KAILEY: MOST IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVE WE IF ALL GOES WELL THAT THERE ARE MUSK AS WELL. AS WE DISCUSSED TODAY AND WATCH STARSHIP CONTINUES TO ORBIT, MOMENT? LEROY: ELON MUSK, SPACEX AND TESLA THINK HE DOES THAT TO DRIVE HIS I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE AS GET THERE. DON'T COUNT HIM OUT. I BACK IN THE DAY DIDN'T THINK THIS WITH THE BOOSTERS. HISTORY IN THE MAKING, FLIGHT NUMBER FIVE WHICH IS 6 WEEKS I EXPECT THEM TO BREAK THINGS, SYSTEM WILL BE OPERATIONAL AND LEE WILEY CHOW, FORMER NASA ASTRONAUT, THANK YOU, ALONG WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT ELSEWHERE DONALD TRUMP IS ROLLING OUT WHOM ARE WITH HIM.

KAILEY: WILL HAVE AN EASY PATH TO GET HOWARD LET NICK -- LUTNICK HE WAS JOCKEYING FOR TREASURY WE DON'T KNOW WHO GETS TREASURY.

WENDY BENJAMINSON WITH THE YOU. WAR IN UKRAINE AND RUSSIA. FIRED LONG-RANGE U.S. AND ESCALATION OF THEIR AT THE G 20 SUMMIT IN BRAZIL, REACTED. &gt;&gt; IF LONG-RANGE MISSILES ARE UKRAINE INTO RUSSIAN TERRITORY, IT WILL ALSO MEAN THEY ARE EXPERTS. WE WILL BE TAKING THIS AS A NEW AGAINST RUSSIA -- WESTERN WAR RUSSIA HAS MADE MOVES, VLADIMIR RUSSIA TO FIRE NUCLEAR WEAPONS ATTACK ON ITS SOIL. DAVID. TO BOTH OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS THIS HAD A SEISMIC EFFECT ON WE SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT IS A IN PARTICULAR WAS UPSET OF THE BEING USED BY RUSSIA TO FIGHT IT LED THE U.S. THEY DIDN'T CONFIRM ON THE WE SEEN WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE FOREIGN MINISTER EIGHT WAS MEANT TO BE A STRONG WARNING TO CHANGE IN NUCLEAR DOCTRINE. BEFORE IT WAS LIKE NUCLEAR STIPULATE IF A NONNUCLEAR WITH A NUCLEAR POWER THAT WOULD THIS WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE SUMMIT. MORNING BETWEEN THE CHANCELLOR JINPING IN WHICH IT WAS XI JINPING DIDN'T TALK ABOUT BUT ACKNOWLEDGED THE CONFLICT THAT GOOD OLAF SCHOLZ HAD A PUTIN IN RUSSIA AND A LOT OF THAT WENT AND OTHERS WERE UPSET FIRST PLACE, WONDERING WHY ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF WE'VE HEARD FROM SOME GLOBAL THE ESCALATION OF THE WAR. PRESIDENT BIDEN DIDN'T HAVE A STATEMENT TO THE PRESS. COMMUNIQUE DEVELOPED BY THE HERE A FORMAL DECLARATION FROM GATHERED IN BRAZIL. ALLUDED TO BUT THE CONFLICT IS PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL WANTED, TO HE WAS ADAMANT THERE WOULD BE ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST AND HE DOCUMENT BUT IT TELLS US THINGS GO FROM HERE, THAT LEADS THE OVAL OFFICE AND A COUPLE OF CHANGE AS A RESULT. ABOUT WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN. JOE: REPORTING ALL WEEK. BALANCE OF POWER, A SUCCESSFUL WITH THE SUPER HEAVY BOOSTER PLAN. AFTER LUNCH RECORD -- THE ROCKET CLEARED THE TOWER, AND THE INDIAN OCEAN. TODAY BY THE CHOPSTICKS AND WE WILL HAVE A LOT MORE AHEAD WITH DAVID AND THE IMPACT OF RUSSIA'S NUCLEAR DOCTRINE, WITH MCCAIN INSTITUTE NEXT ON &gt;&gt; EVERY THREAT FROM RUSSIA 1000 DAYS, IT HAS BEEN CRUCIAL ABILITY TO FUND ITS WAR THROUGH UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY MARKS THE 1000TH DAY OF THE WAR UKRAINE HAS FIRED U.S. INTO RUSSIA, HAVING JUST U.S. TO USE THEM OFFENSIVELY. JOINING US NOW FOR MORE IS INSTITUTE AND FORMER DEPUTY FOR RUSSIA AND UKRAINE. I WONDER YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE MISSILES BECAUSE IT GOT THE IMPLEMENTING A NEW NUCLEAR TALKING ABOUT ARTICLE FIVE IN WAS THIS WELL-TIMED TO THE NEGOTIATION TABLE OR A POOR GAME? EVELYN: THINK IT WAS WELL-TIMED HAVE COME A LOT SOONER. I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS ESCALATORY, LET 'ER RIP PUTIN THREATENED TO ESCALATE. THE WHITE HOUSE IS TRYING TO IN ORDER FOR A PIECE TO BE FAIR GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO HANG ONTO THIS IS WHERE THIS COMES INTO HOW QUICKLY CAN THEY MAKE A WE ARE JUST TWO MONTHS AWAY IT'S ONE THING TO USE THE A ONE-HIT DEPOT AND THAT'S A LOT INTO HIS WAR MACHINE AND HE HIS SIDE. IN THE OTHER ASPECT IS UKRAINE TERRITORY ITS EAST AND RUSSIA GOVERNMENT IS PUTTING THE NEW IF UKRAINE CAN USE THE NORTH KOREAN FORCES, IT CAN ALSO SEND A VERY STRONG SIGNAL FRIENDS OF RUSSIA THAT MIGHT BE PERSONNEL IN TO HELP RUSSIA. UKRAINE BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY EXTENT TO WHICH VLADIMIR PUTIN BIDEN IS STILL IN OFFICE? FIRST OF ALL, UKRAINE COULD HAS PROVIDED THIS PERMISSION SANCTIONS BUT THERE'S ALSO A NORTH KOREAN HUMANS IN, THAT WOULD BE DISTRESSING. SABOTAGE OPERATIONS ALL OVER THIS PAST WEEK WE BELIEVE, IT SOME UNDERSEA CABLES, WHICH IS WE'VE HAD OFFICIALS IN EUROPE RUSSIA IS PLAYING WITH FIRE ACTIONS VIS-A-VIS THE UNITED WHEN WE FOCUS ON HIS ACTION IN NUCLEAR DOCTRINE WE LEARNED SPEAKING AT THE G20 SAID RUSSIA WAR TAKING PLACE. RUSSIA'S ATTITUDE ABOUT WHAT JUSTIFICATION FOR USE OF THESE IF THIS IS JUST A BLUSTER AND EVELYN: SIGNALING BECAUSE I CANNOT ESTABLISHMENT ACTUALLY NUCLEAR WEAPON OR SOME KIND OF UKRAINE. LITERAL FALLOUT ON RUSSIAN POLITICAL FALLOUT AND WIDELY CONDEMNED. RISK WOULD BE TO HIM EVEN RUSSIA. RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD FOLLOW MY MIND, THE LIKELIHOOD IS NOT IT'S INCREDIBLY RECKLESS OF THE THESE KIND OF THREATS. I LOOK AT THIS AS A SIGN OF HE MAKES THESE THREATS WHEN HE OPTION. JOE: DOES VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY NEED TRUMP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE? HE MET WITH HIM RECENTLY DURING THAT THERE IS A RUSH TO DO THAT. HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP APPROACHES I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE HIM AT BUT QUESTION IS WHETHER HE CAN AND A PIECE THAT IS FAIR. UKRAINE WITH SOME KIND OF IF PRESIDENT TRUMP ISN'T GOING UKRAINE, AND I THINK ALL NATO STATES HAVE AGREED BEHIND TO THAT, IF PRESIDENT TRUMP TO OFFER A BILATERAL SECURITY WITH JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA AND I THINK IT WILL BE INTERESTING NEGOTIATING POSITION AS IT I'M HOPEFUL HE WILL HELP TABLE IN THE END BECAUSE THE UNDERSTAND HE CAN'T CONTINUE UKRAINE, HE WILL NOT WIN. PRESIDENT-ELECT WANTS TO SEEAN THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AS PEACE WILL COME SOONER, EVEN THERE IS REPORTING THAT THE TO DELIVER A CEASE-FIRE IN THE INCOMING PRESIDENT BUT THE HAS A PLAN ON THE TABLE NOW AND GETTING CLOSER TO THAT BUT I EVELYN: I KNOW THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION THEIR SPECIAL ENVOY NEGOTIATING HAVING SAID THAT, CYNICALLY I WILL DRAG IT OUT SO THEY CAN TRUMP AS PRESIDENT. BUT THEY WILL STILL TRY TO TIE PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHICH IS FINE. PEACE AND IF THAT'S HOW THEY ACQUIESCENCE TO THE COMPROMISED EVERYONE CONCERNED. KAILEY: EVELYN FARKAS, THANK YOU VERY COMING UP, PRESIDENT-ELECT AND TEXAS. POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS WITH OUR ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. &gt;&gt; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

[LAUGHTER] HAPPENING ON THE GROUND, DONALD TRUMP STANDING SHOULDER WHOM HE OBVIOUSLY HAS GROWN SPACEX IS DOING THIS IN PART TALK TO US ABOUT THE CONFLICT &gt;&gt; I THINK ELON MUSK, LIKE HIM JOB WITH TESLA AND SPACEX. GOVERNMENT IS IN REGARDS TO I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY MORE IMPORTANT I THINK THE HAGGERTY, TED CRUZ, THAT'S WHAT QUITE AN ENTOURAGE. JOE: YORK? IS THIS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST ABUSE OF POWER, OR SOMETHING &gt;&gt; I LOVE THE NOTION OF THE COMPETITION, MORE BUSINESSES GETTING BETTER. SERIOUS FAULTLINES WHEN IT COMES TO THE TAKE OVER 62 DAYS AND ELON MUSK WILL BE CHARGED IT'S A CASE OF HOW MUCH DONALD WILL BE INTERESTING 62 DAYS STILL BE THE SHADOW VICE TRUMP DOESN'T LIKE TO SHARE THE ALONE THE RICHEST MAN IN THE BUT HE SUPPOSED TO LEAD THE BUT YOU THINK THERE WILL BE A I CERTAINLY THINK THERE WILL BE HIS COUNTERPART ON THAT, AND BACKGROUND CHECKS, NOT A NORMAL IT WILL BE UP TO HOW MUCH DONALD TRUMP EMPOWERS THIS DOGE TO LOOK INTO GOVERNMENT FUNDING THERE WILL PROBABLY MAKE DAYS A WEEK. [LAUGHTER] JOE: WHAT COMES OUT OF THE DOGE AND TRUMP OR CONGRESS WILL LISTEN? THERE WILL BE RECOMMENDATIONS THERE WILL BE A WHOLE UNION FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WHAT TO CUT EMPLOYEES OR PROGRAMS. ASHLEY: THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, ARE LIBERAL POLICIES AND CONGRESS HAVE TO APPROVE AT. IN THE HOUSE, AND SLIM MAJORITY TO DO. PROJECT AND NOT BE INTERESTED I GUESS WE WILL FIND OUT IN THE SOONER. ARE STAYING TUNED FOR MORE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. HOWARD LUTN &gt;&gt; THE ETHICS COMMITTEE HAS THE REPORT AND I THINK WHAT SCARES TIME TRUMP WAS IN THE WHITE SURROUNDS HIMSELF WITH SEXUAL ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT, BUT &gt;&gt; [INDISCERNIBLE] &gt;&gt; I THINK IF THEY WANT A SPEEDY CONSIDERATION FOR THIS AS MUCH TRANSPARENCY AS WE CAN. &gt;&gt; THE REALITY IS ALL OF THAT AT THE HEARING. I WILL HOLD MY FOLKS TO THE DEMOCRAT NOMINEES. JOE: THAT IS SOME SENATORS TALKING TO US EARLIER AND TALKING ABOUT THE PICK FOR THE COMMITTEE MEETS TOMORROW KEVIN, THIS SEEMS TO BE THE IF YOU ARE A LAWMAKER AND WANT YOU CAN PICK UP TO SHEET OR WILL BE AN FBI BACKGROUND CHECK HEARING. KEVIN: BACKGROUND CHECK, EVEN FOR I THINK THE INTERESTING THING, AT THAT LOUNGE, ONE OF THEM WAS HE SAID IT'S UNWISE TO PUT PROCESS IF THEY CAN'T GET THE 53 REPUBLICAN VOTES. A RECESS APPOINTMENT. REPUBLICAN SENATORS ALMOST THE HOUSE AND SENATE FOR POWER TO THE EXECUTIVE BUT WE CONTROVERSIAL NOMINATIONS OF THE QUESTION I GUESS IS HOW TO STAND THEIR GROUND FOR. ONES WE CAN PICK FROM BUT THE WANTS TO ALIGN THEMSELVES, OR PRESIDENT CLOSELY. MATT GAETZ? ASHLEY: OBVIOUSLY DOD IS CONTROVERSIAL THERE, BUT EVEN WITH RFK, WHICH HIM JFK WITH YOU THE OTHER DAY. WHEN HE WAS UP FOR EPA. HARD. I THINK YOU HAVE MITCH MCCONNELL, LISA MURKOWSKI, THREE VOTES AND I THINK MAKE SURE HE SPEAKS, AND HE CAN 2020 SIX AND HE PROBABLY IS NOT THORN IN THE SIDE. THERE. BUT I THINK MATT GAETZ FALLS. ASHLEY: RECESS APPOINTMENTS AND HOW IT IT'S A GREAT TALKING POINT. JOE: IN THE HOUSE AS WELL AS THE ALSO WITH THE SLIM MAJORITY, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THAT WILL POSITIONS, THEY WILL ONLY BE UP BRIAN FITZPATRICK FROM TENSILE MODERATE DEMOCRAT, HE MIGHT NOT ANIL THINK IT'S AS DIRE.

DONALD TRUMP IS AFRAID TO HAVE THE WRONG TEMPER FOR THE PROTERRA FOR WALL STREET SO HE WALL STREET SO HE CAN TAKE THAT I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S PUTTING ONE WAS TAKEN OFF THE LIST TARIFFS FOR THE MARKET. ASHLEY: SOMEONE HE CAN JELL WITH. FOR THIS POSITION. I WAS SURPRISED BY THE LUTNICK WOULD BE LINDA MCMAHON, LOOKS AMBASSADOR OF THE U.K. OBVIOUSLY TREASURY WILL BE THEY PLAY A HUGE ROLE IN ECONOMY AND TARIFFS SO I THINK WANTS SOMEONE SERIOUS. CABINET FILLED. KAILEY: GOOD POINT. NOMINATION FOR COMMERCE STATEMENT HE WILL HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OFFICE TRADE REPRESENTATIVE. HOW THAT WORKS. WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT COMMAND.
