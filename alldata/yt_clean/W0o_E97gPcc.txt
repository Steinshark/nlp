God damn it! Are you alright, buddy? Yes, yes. Is swearing allowed? Sure. It's f**ked up. A drone is coming toward us. We need to take cover. Here's your answer to the question of what people's psychology is like here. There are no people left in the platoon; no one is available for replacement. Everyone, if you see this -- it means we are alive and well. Water. Here you go. This is how we make our way to the 'Khartiia' unit's positions near Lypci. We're walking on foot, not sure how far we've come, but it's been several kilometers already, with five in total to go. It's not a straight road -- just winding paths like this. We have to move carefully; a few drones have already flown over us. But the guys are resilient and do this regularly, so they need your support. Also, don't forget to support our publication; we're constantly creating reports from Kharkiv region, with military updates and stories from liberated areas. There's a drone coming our way; we're going to take cover. Please support us and join our Community. Damn, I can barely finish my line... Together, we can bring you more important stories from Kharkiv region. We'll continue to the positions -- stay tuned to see how the 'Khartiia' infantry is pressing forward and liberating the Lyptsi community. Let's stretch, guys! Radio: Minus Plus-plus, when you get there report back. Yes, look, they stole everything over there, damn it, f**kers. Over there, there are some nice white bags. Wait, but where's the water? My water? Yes. It's outside. I still have 2 bottles left. What kind? Small ones? 0.7 and 0.5 liters. That should be enough for today, You sure? There are also energy drinks. Usually, I would take 6 bottles for 4 days, but it's not as hot anymore. And carrying them, 3 kilograms, is quite a burden. How long are you here for? For 4 days. Rotation. See, only two of them came this time, but when there was a chance, there used to be four. This observation post is located in the rear. This is a relatively safe spot. We're at the edge of the forest, then 200 meters of open field -- and those f*gs. It's somewhat of a transit area. So, you're safe here. But it's still a bit loud. Huh? It's a bit noisy. Well, this isn't too loud; someone is just warming up. Loud is when a mortar shell comes in. Drone is above us. Okay, guys, be careful: this is an uncovered observation post. If you hear buzzing -- move to the edge or in the hole. Usually, they throw 'lighters' (type of explosive). It's not guaranteed they'll use those. Don't expose yourselves unnecessarily here, we have already gone through this before. Radio: The one above you right now, that's me. I repeat, that's me. Copy. This is the Ukrainian-Russian war. We kill those who want to kill us. And what kind of bed have you made? I did it so I wouldn't be sad in the den. We're turning this &quot;cottage&quot; into a &quot;penthouse.&quot; Five stars. Come visit. 3333, Brigade &quot;Khartiia,&quot; we're waiting for you. The best unit in the world. Radio: The target is gone, over. Roger that, thank you. Alright, guys, you'll find your way back on your own, it's only 50 meters from here. Yeah. Alright. Code name: <<Lys Anderson>> Most famous one. All the world's awards are mine... Huh... In short, are you medics? Radio: Brooklyn 3, weak signal. Are you from the fourth unit? Yes. So you also pass through Vovchansk? It was such a strange emotion when an old cople came out of their house during the shelling; they were over 80, holding hands while caught in a missile strike. It was so sweet, but damn, people are dying. You had to see it: they held hands and got hit. 'Until death do us part.' That's very harsh. And what's the situation like here now? Is swearing allowed? Sure. It's f*cked up. Just make sure to bleep it later. There are no medical supplies, drones are flying around like at home. They've been driven away a bit by the rain, but getting in alive is just a quest. I understand you're evacuating the wounded? Yes. And bodies as well. So, tell us, Lys Anderson, how long have you been here? Well, I can say I've been here for... 18 days now? Yeah, this is my 18th day. Here, at this position? In this forest altogether. I'm breaking records here. Really, you've been sitting here for 18 days without leaving? Why? Because there's no one to replace me. Initially, we came in for 3 days for evacuation, then we were replaced by the 6th company, and we replaced our observation post team with scouts. I was a scout for some days; I don't remember how long, and now I'm on evacuation for the 5th day today. Is this all the water we have? No, we have plenty of it. Where do you find the strength to work? Where else? I want to go home and see my family -- that's the only thing. You have to listen for the drones; sometimes you get indifferent to them, but the mortars... AGS -- that's the worst, because you can't hear the launches. What we heard together was from the AGS. It's tough. Evacuation is always hard. It sucks. No one really appreciates it, when you have to lift a wounded person or a body into a vehicle, it feels like &quot;Armageddon.&quot; You have to consider the terrain. It's very difficult to safely carry someone to the vehicle because the drones are watching. It's a fat target when four people carry one wounded person. They could take us all out. And there's also the moment when you're in the field and a vehicle pulls up, and they start firing 80 and 120 calibers at it. You still have to carefully place the wounded person in there. Yes, the task is quite challenging. Do you have a lot of work? It depends on the situation. Before, there were a lot of casualties that we had to load. This time, God had mercy on us: there was only one wounded person, two days ago. The black film? That's bulletproof film. This? Yes, bulletproof film, for everything. Only those who have been in such holes will understand this joke. The depth of the blindage doesn't matter when you don't have bulletproof film. Consider that you have nothing. Why is it bulletproof film? What do you think? It's just ordinary black film! Well, you know, it's like when... <<There's no hope, but there is faith>>. and this faith is what saves you. It's like a placebo. Self-hypnosis. ...And at headquarters, they say... God damn it. The towed vehicle arrives first, huh. That was close. Well, that's something unclear. And that's already a hit, right? Uh-huh. And the first one was the same. No. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Something is flying. It's either AGL (automatic grenade launcher), perhaps. I was walking in the daytime and stepped on mine in the middle of the day. There were a hell of a lot of them, about a dozen. Looks like it's AGL. Do you have armor or not? Oh, is that a backpack? Yes, a backpack. You can put it there. Come on, just sit closer to me. The forest has changed beyond recognition. The forest is gone. It's very hard; there's nowhere to hide. Well, you've all seen it yourself. I'm not that young, this is hard for me. Today, we've walked at least 5 kilometers loaded, in rough terrain. in rough terrain. This is a very dangerous place. It's very physically demanding. It's even hard for people who are 25 years old, we can see that. And for those close to 50, it's twice as hard because of numerous diseases; health is not what it used to be, given to the most beloved factory. Something like that. How old are you? How old do you think I am? 35 - 38. Oh, come on, you're flattering me -- 49. But you are looking yonger. Well, because I'm positive. I smile a lot. But if I shave, then yes, I'll look younger, of course. Everyone says that, it makes me happy. Not everything is lost yet. In your free time, what do you do at the position? Free time? In the best case, if allowed by drones, you try to secure yourself with some additional engineering structures: holes, roofs, camouflage. If drones allow it. Sometimes you might have nothing to do for a couple of days because you expose your position and they'll start shelling you. Not much, really. It's just morally difficult here. Just silence sometimes scares you, but mostly, it's reassuring. It seems suspicious, for example, like now, that it's quiet because it could end badly. Well, something is flying. Maybe it's ours. Well, it seems like it's aircraft munitions, or a 60mm. Buddy, are you alive? Yes, yes. Come on, get in further. I even linched a little. Denys, are you okay? Yeah. Do you have any more space over there? You'll look sad. Here's your answer to the question of how people's psychology is here. Of course. When you have only a piece of film over your head 95% of the time. Well, it's good that we're sitting here. You always have to expect some f**king bulls**t from them. Don't be euphoric. You know, this silence ends very badly. Everything seems suspicious. Maximum firepower, of course. Just remember, when the shelling -- don't move: jsut jump into any hole, any crummy trench full of s**t, but without those f*gs and stay quite, no one goes anywhere, remember that. Honestly, I have no desire to go anywhere. Here it comes. Well, this is already 120mm, pretty f**king possibly. We got here a little earlier and have been here or five days now. It seems we might switch out tomorrow. Normally, we stay four days and then rotate, but this time there was a bit more work. Overall, we're managing, though it's pretty cold. We had nine injured over the past three days, including our guys and friends from nearby units. Sometimes it's more, sometimes less, but the work has to be done. Once, we faced a tough situation with an evacuation that took way too long due to logistical and road issues. One of our injured, who had an arterial bleed, had to lie out there all night. He was hit around 5 p.m., and we could only get him to the vehicle by 10 a.m. the next day. That night we had close to 10 wounded all at once. In the background: Basically, all the fallen have already been retrieved. My colleague, two injured soldiers, and I were carrying stretchers to load our comrade, who had a severe arterial bleed and was the heaviest to carry, all while under "fireworks." The hardest part of evacuation is the moment of loading the wounded into the vehicle because, honestly, I don't know if our electronic warfare systems are working or not, but their drones still fly around, adjusting their fire. I can't say anything good about this part because, as we were taught in Zolochiv, we're only supposed to provide aid and evacuate when we have fire superiority. In reality, the vehicle constantly moves while being shelled. In the background: &quot;Pasha, your stories are too grim. No one will donate money to that.&quot; I'm not asking for money. In the background: &quot;Just tell it how it is.&quot; Well, in plain terms, we're working here, and the guys come to us -- sometimes with an evac team, sometimes alone. We stabilize them as best we can: tourniquets, tamponades, occlusive dressings, and so on. A dose of antibiotics is mandatory if the injury is significant. Injections, etc. And, in most cases, they're off to further evacuation in decent condition. There are cases like I described above, but they're rarer. Usually, the evacuations go smoothly. Somewhere deeper, a bit to the right. From a hole, you don't really understand what's happening. You only hear it, but you can't guess. Someone got hit. What do you mean? It sounded on the radio when it hit. Seriously? That's why people can't sit here. And someone talks about it; psychologists give lectures. They just need to come here and sit for a week. Well, yes. A week? Few days will be enough. They must try to walk like Lyss Anderson through the paths and understand that they are shitty psychologist. I wouldn't want to participate, but this is the army. To be honest, after two and a half years of war, there's very little strength and motivation left. I don't know; we need motivation. I need my wife and daughter to come back from abroad, to live in peace -- that's my motivation. For them to come back and for there to be no war here. And for there to be no 'Russian peace.' That's the motivation for now. That's it. No more motivation; money doesn't matter. There aren't enough people. The only ones who help us are the acquired forces who constantly assist us, risking their lives. Where? Well, I don't know. Clearly not at the TCC (Territorial Recruitment Center) where they pull people from minibuses. That's not right. Overall negative. There's probably no other situation, but these are very low standards. I don't like it. I'm fighting against it, but it seems there's no other way. I don't want it to be like in Russia, where they grab me and shove me into a trench. Those people definitely have no motivation. And they aren't great fighters. This one went even further. Usually, they release about 15 of them. This looks lighter, from what I hear. Yes, this is something small. And here's something heavier for you. Yes, this is also lighter. People can't stay here for too long because they need to recover both physically and morally. These long stays... People need to rest, recover, gather strength, but most importantly -- they need to recover psychologically. The situations here can be very different. It's good when everything is fine, but sometimes it's really tough, and people break down, they can't handle it. And that's okay. The coolest moment is when you leave this hellish forest and get home. That brings some euphoria, a bout of unrestrained joy. You're happy to see everyone, even old enemies; you want to hug them. You think: 'God, did it all really end?' Then you realize it's just for a while. That's all the joys of life right now. You're very glad you're alive. That was really intense, comrades. Everyone, If you see this, it means we're alive and well.
