- [CAPCOMM] Houston, you're You're a go for - [Narrator] On July 20, the Apollo 11 lunar module a warning light flashed in the cockpit. - [Neil] 1202. - [Houston] 1202 alarm. - It's a 1202. - [Narrator] The spacecraft's and rebooted and no one knew why. As Houston scrambled to find an answer, an anxious Neil Armstrong - [Neil] Give us a reading - [Narrator] Back on Earth, than a young computer programmer who had written the code - We were landing on It's not surprising there were problems. My name is Don Eyles, I wrote a good part of the computer code that was active during of the Apollo mission. - [Narrator] Eyles career at - This was the summer of I was walking back home from a I think at an insurance company. At that point I would have taken any job that anyone offered me. When I happened by the and walked in cold and asked for a job. - [Narrator] He had never Even so, Eyles was offered a position. That day he joined an army of over 400,000 scientists, engineers, and technicians working on the most in human history. - No one knew how to land on the moon yet, just as no one knew how and we would figured out both. - Hello, today we're at the which has been given design responsibility for this guidance and navigation system, which will direct our Apollo spacecraft on the way to the moon and back. - [Narrator] In 1969, this machine ever created. Before Apollo, computers had often taking up entire rooms - When you say this computer is very much like land-based computers, as occupying whole bays of equipment. You've got all this How did you do that? - [Narrator] What was revolutionary about the Apollo computer was that it was the first use of integrated circuits, which allowed for a much - [Don] The computer was one cubic foot. It was roughly six inches And weighed I believe about 70 pounds. - [Narrator] Despite these advancements, the Apollo computer's limitations presented formidable challenges. - [Don] We were dealing with a computer that was very limited both in terms of its memory capacity and its operation speed. What this book in front of me is is a listing of the flight code for the lunar module for This represents the contents of 36,000, 36k, words of memory. - [Narrator] To give you 36k of memory is, an average email message - Alternately for flight the would be woven into a type of memory called core rope that was super reliable. The result of that was six And these modules would be slid into slots in the back of the computer. And that would be the code. That was equivalent to plug in the CD-ROM into your early Mac. - [Narrator] Memory was so precious, the code that Eyles and had to both do its job and also do so in as few characters as possible. - When you write a piece of code you're writing something that needs to, in as few words as But at the same time it needs to fall trippingly off the tongue You could call it a lapidary sort of art in the sense that you were and trying to get them just right. (static hissing) - [Computer] 1202 alarm. - [Narrator] So what was happening during Apollo 11's landing when - 1202. - [Houston] It's a 1202, standby. - [Narrator] The computer's error codes 1201 and 1202, but the astronauts didn't know what those alarms meant. And for 50 years, neither It all happened so fast. Not even the programmers who designed it were sure just what was happening. - [Reporter] There are many new things that are happening in this flight. There are big dangers involved, despite the best our technology can do and our technology does do very well. - Right here you see At the time, we were sort You know, what is going to happen next? Is the spacecraft gonna keep flying okay? Or is it gonna somehow go outta control? - [Announcer] They got a - [Narrator] As the descent to the moon, a terrified Eyles came to the conclusion that the mission was doomed. - There was a pit of the stomach feeling. If it had been up to me, I probably would have - [Narrator] But flight had a better perspective. Soon after the alarm started, that the computer was still running the critical guidance - [Houston] Go, same type, we're go. Eagle, Houston, you are - [Narrator] Rather than decision for Apollo to proceed. Neil Armstrong took over and Apollo, of course, - [Neil] Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed. - There was no sense of blame. There was no one calling you and saying, &quot;You fools, what did you do to us?&quot; but there were questions being asked. It was up to us to figure - [Narrator] The alarm issues were traced to an obscure condition in which a radar accidentally turned on, with unnecessary data. - The alarms were saying we're going to flush everything and sort of reconstruct it. Do what you would call a restart. - [Narrator] Eyles code it had done exactly what The issue was caused by Someone had accidentally flipped a switch when it shouldn't have been flipped. - It was determined that in fact the switches were set up in such a fashion that this weird condition could occur. - [Narrator] For his part, and his code was deployed successfully in every Apollo mission. - What was developed was actually extremely advanced for the time and in some ways its more advanced that some of what's being used Because the greater of today's computers don't force you to be as compact as we had to.
