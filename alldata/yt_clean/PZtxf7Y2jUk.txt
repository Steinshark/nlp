THE CONVERSATION FEMALE SPEAKER: IN EVERYTHING CAN CHANGE. THE CLOSING OF THE BEGINNING OF WHEN MIRACLES AND WE GET A GLIMPSE THE PLACE WHERE JONI: WELL, WE'VE BEEN WITH JIM WOODFORD. JIM, I WANT TO PICK WHEN YOU GOT AN AERIAL CAN YOU TELL JIM: PEOPLE WILL ASK ME, DID YOU SEE YOUR FAMILY, OF COURSE, MY DAD AND I SAID, NO, AND I AT THE TIME, BUT I'VE REALIZED NOW THEY DIDN'T, YOU CAN'T STEP ON THE AND EVER COME BACK OUT. ONCE YOU GO THROUGH YOU DON'T COME BACK OUT. BUT THE GUARDIAN ASKED ME TO HOLD HIS CLOAK, AND I HELD IT AND AND HE MADE A MOTION. AND I THOUGHT AT FIRST, IT WAS A REFLECTING POOL, BUT THEN IT OPENED UP AND AND SO HE'S FLYING AND I GET THIS AERIAL WHICH WAS VIDEO GAMES. A LOT OF PEOPLE AND BUT, AGAIN, HE KNEW FOR ME AS A PILOT, WAS I WAS USED TO FROM 30 THOUSAND AND SO I'M SHOWN HOW THE AND THE SIZE OF IT, AND THE ENORMITY OF IT, AND THE CITIZENS OF IT. I HAVE TO TELL AND MY VISION HAD CHANGED. I COULD, I HAD ALMOST AND I COULD FOCUS ON THE AND SEE THE PETALS OR LOOK BACK DOWN AND SEE THE PEOPLE SAY, WELL, THAT IT WAS NO WORSE AND WATCHING TV, YOU KNOW. IT WAS SECOND NATURE. AND I WOULD SEE ALL THESE BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU BECAUSE SO MANY WOMEN HAVE COME UP TO TELL ME THAT AND WHAT I SAW WAS, NOT JUST THE HALLS THE HALLS OF MUSIC, THE HALLS OF RECORDS, THE HALLS OF HEALING. I SAID WHY WOULD YOU NEED, I SAID WHY WOULD YOU NEED A HE SAID, JAMES, PEOPLE COME TO AS YOU DID IN TRAGIC AND WE NEED A PERIOD OF FOR THEIR SOUL WHAT HAPPENED AND AND THEY ARE CARED FOR AND THEY ARE LOVED, AND THEY ARE FOREVER AND SO IT WAS TO SEE THAT. IT REALLY WAS. JONI: THERE WAS ONE THAT STOOD OUT. JIM: I'M TRYING NOT TO IT HAD KIND OF LIKE A PINK THE BUILDING IS NOT STONE. IT'S CURVED FROM LIGHT. EVERYTHING IS AND THERE WAS THIS LIGHT AND WENT BACK AND IT WAS PINK AND I SAID TO WHAT'S THIS BUILDING? AND HE SAID THAT, AND I SAID, AND HE SAID YES. THIS IS WHERE THE SOULS OF ABORTED CHILDREN, OR CHILDREN WHO OR IN THEIR INNOCENCE, THROUGH DISEASE AND THOSE LITTLE SOULS ARE PRECIOUS TO GOD. JONI: OR EVEN JIM: MISCARRIAGES. JONI: BECAUSE THE SOUL IS CREATED AT THE TIME OF CONCEPTION. THAT THERE'S A LIGHT THAT COMES FROM GOD INTO THAT ETERNAL SOUL. JIM: EXACTLY. EXACTLY. AND SO THAT'S AND I REMEMBER SAYING I SAID, ARE THEY LIKE AND HE LOOKED AT ME WITH THIS [ LAUGHTER ] RACHEL: THAT'S WHAT IF THEY'RE STILL BABIES. CINDY: A LOT OF WORK. JONI: DID HE TELL YOU THAT THEY MATURE FASTER? JIM: THEY DO. BECAUSE AND THEN HE WENT THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE GROWING THEY AGE THREE TIMES, A FACTOR OF THREE TIMES. SO A CHILD THAT WOULD WOULD BE SIX IN HEAVEN. AT 3, THEY'RE NINE, THEN YOU JOIN THE GENERAL AND YOUR FAMILY. AND YOUR FAMILY WHEN YOU'RE IN BUT HERE'S AN EVERYONE IN HEAVEN LOOKED TO ME WITH TO BE IN THEIR EARLY 30S. AND THE GUARDIAN NO ONE IN HEAVEN IS ANY OLDER WHEN HE DIED AT 33. SUZY: SO GOOD, 33. JIM: SO I DON'T BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY, ALL OF YOU ARE YOUNG. BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD SUZY: YES, NOT AGE, STAY HERE. JIM: BUT ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL? SO THE EXCEPTIONS JONI: HOW OLD SUZY: 34. SO I'M FINE AT 33, I'LL TAKE IT. JONI: YOU'RE GONNA BE ONE THAN YOU LOOK RIGHT NOW. JIM: HOW OLD ARE YOU? SUZY: 34. JIM: YOU KNOW, IT'S A [ LAUGHTER ] SUZY: I'M 24, JUST KIDDING. SIN TO LIE. JONI: IT'S A SIN TO LIE. OKAY, SO, ONE OF WHEN I HEARD IS THAT WHEN THE GUARDIAN THAT THE LORD SOME OF THE LOVE HE HAD FOR THOSE CHILDREN AND THAT EVERY ONE WAS JIM: YES. THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING IS THIS FEELING, YOUR INTELLECT TELLS YOU THAT THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT, BUT YOUR SOUL WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS I FELT WHEN JESUS I FELT LIKE I WAS THE ONLY IT WAS THAT AND YOU WILL FEEL IT, YOU WILL ALL FEEL IT. SUZY: I CAN'T WAIT. JIM: YOU KNOW, AND HE KNEW ME. HE KNEW EVERYTHING AND THAT WORRIED BUT BY THIS TIME, IT WAS TOO LATE. HE'D ALREADY DECIDED I WAS GONNA BE BUT I THOUGHT I WAS STILL YOU KNOW, SO, I MEAN, BECAUSE I HAD THE THAT I HAD COME HOME. I WAS HOME. AND ALTHOUGH I'D LOVE MY FAMILY AND, YET, TO ME IT FELT BE ABOUT A THEY'RE GONNA BE WITH ME. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE, AN ETERNITY TIME. JONI: OKAY, SO TO WHERE, I GUESS, I DON'T KNOW IF IT OR IF IT WAS THE ANGEL THAT PULLED SOMETHING OUT AND WAS READING TELL US WHAT HAPPENED. JIM: WHILE I WAS I LOOKED FOR THE, THE GUARDIAN. AND I TURNED AND JUST THERE WAS A SLIGHT AND UP IN THAT RISE, WAS THE ANGEL. AND HE WAS IN A BENT OVER, AND HE WAS HOLDING A NO BIGGER THAN A HE WAS HOLDING AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, I SAW ANOTHER FIGURE WHO WAS BENT. JONI: WAS HE READING WHAT WAS ON THE PAGES? JIM: WELL, I AT THE TIME BECAUSE THE FACE, HE WAS THE FACE WAS COVERED ON A HOT DAY ON A TEXAS ROAD. IT WAS A SHIMMER BUT CLEARLY THERE WAS ABOUT THIS NEW CREATURE. BECAUSE THERE WAS THAT FLEW, FLOWED DOWN ALL SIDES IT BEHAVED LIKE SLOW-MOVING BUT IT WAS LIGHT. BUT IT HAD SUBSTANCE OF WATER. AND BECAUSE HE IT WAS COMING DOWN AND THIS GOLD LIGHT OFF THE BODY. AND I NOTICED ALTHOUGH THE FLOWERS WERE WHEREVER THAT GOLDEN THEY BLOOMED AGAIN AND LARGER AGAIN. AND I WATCHED AS IT CAME DOWN AND A AND IT WAS AT IT WAS THAT THE MOMENT THAT THE GUARDIAN WITH THOSE VIOLET EYES, HOLDING THE BOOK UP, AND HE SAID TO ME, JAMES, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE LIFE MY AND I HAD NO ANSWER. WITH ALL THE RESOURCES AND ALL THE KINDNESS OH, I GAVE TO CHARITY, IF I GOT AT TAX RECEIPT. I COULD HAVE DONE AND, YOU KNOW, THE NOVEL HAS A WONDERFUL AND I QUOTE IT MANKIND SHOULD HAVE MANKIND SHOULD HAVE BUT I WAS COMPLETELY AND MY OWN EGO. AND SO -- JONI: WERE YOU SAD THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE JIM: OH, I MEAN, THE BOOK ROADSIDE DINER MENU. AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS ALL, I THOUGHT I HAD THAT WAS THE EPITOME OF THE WEALTH, SUFFICIENT TO A FLEET OF BRITISH LARGE BOAT, AIRPLANES, I MEAN, HOW DOES BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING? I WOULD WAKE UP IN THE AND I WOULD IS THIS ALL THERE IS? AND I THOUGHT I OR A NEWER PLANE. AND I'D GO OUT AND I'D IT DIDN'T HELP. WHAT I WAS CINDY: WOW. JIM: AND SO THAT'S BECAUSE WE'VE BECOME SUCH AND WE NEED TO KEEP, AND THAT'S NOT BAD, BUT WE HAVE TO AND IT'S SO WONDERFUL THAT YOU FOLKS OUT OF TALKING ABOUT GOD, AND JONI: OKAY, SO THE PERSON THAT THE GUARDIAN AND READING AND YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS, THEN HE FINISHED READING. JIM: SO HE FINISHED THE BOOK, AND THEN THAT FIGURE AND THE GOLDEN LIGHT THE WAVER VANISHED AND I REALIZED, I WAS LOOKING AT THE THE SON OF GOD. SOMEONE THAT I THOUGHT WAS AND HERE I'M AND IN, AND HE AND I FELL ON MY KNEES, AND I STILL TRIED AND THAT LOOK AND IN THOSE EYES OF BLUE AND I SAW ETERNITY. I SAW SADNESS FOR I SAW SADNESS FOR THE WAY MANKIND HAS IGNORED BUT I ALSO SAW FORGIVENESS AND THAT WAS THE MOMENT I REFERRED TO EIGHT WHEN I FELT THAT I HE'D EVER CREATED. I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU ALL TO EXPERIENCE CINDY: YOU KNOW, IN CONVERSATION YESTERDAY THAT YOU SAID TO HIM, LET ME STAY, I WON'T BE ANY TROUBLE. JIM: THANKS FOR AND SO HE SMILED AT ME, AND I STARTED AND HE RAISED HIS HAND, IN AN UNMISTAKABLE COME NO CLOSER. AND SO -- JONI: DID YOU SEE ANYTHING WHEN HE RAISED HIS HAND? JIM: YES. WHEN HE RAISED HIS HAND, THE SLEEVE OF HIS AND THERE WAS THE MARK AND YOU KNOW I FELT THAT I HAD HELD A I MEAN, IT WAS WHAT WE DID TO THAT MAN. AND, BUT HE FORGAVE ME, HE FORGAVE ALL OF US. AND -- JONI: AND WHAT BECAUSE HE SAID JIM: HE LOOKED AT ME AND, AND THEN I REALIZED, AND HE SMILED EVEN WIDER. AND THEN HE SAID, GENTLY NODDED HIS HEAD. AND THEN HE SAID TO ME, THESE WORDS, HIS AND HAD MOTIONED NOT HE SAID, JAMES, MY SON, THIS IS NOT YET YOUR TIME. GO BACK, TELL YOUR OF THE WONDERS WE AND HIS HAND CAME DOWN AND FOLDED OVER HIS LEFT. AND THEN THE FULL THAT I WAS BEING THAT I WASN'T BEING AND I STARTED TO BEG. I STARTED TO PLEAD. I STARTED TO CRY. DON'T SEND ME BACK. PLEASE, JESUS, DON'T. JONI: DO Y'ALL SEE THAT NO JIM: THIS IS WHAT ALL MY LIFE, PLEASE. AND THEN I SAID THIS, WHICH I'M ETERNALLY PLEASE DON'T SEND ME BACK. PLEASE DON'T, DON'T. LET ME STAY. I WON'T BE ANY TROUBLE. [ LAUGHTER ] JIM: AND SUDDENLY, TWO AND ACTUALLY, WRESTLED WHICH IS KIND OF USELESS. AND, BUT AS THEY I LOOKED BACK OVER MY SHOULDER AND JESUS WAS GONE. BUT STANDING EXACTLY IN THE WAS THE WARRIOR ANGEL. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE BEGAN TO GROW. HE WAS ALREADY AND HE LET OUT TO THEIR FULL WINGSPAN. 12 FEET ON EITHER SIDE, AND THE WINGS AND HE GLOWED AND THE MESSAGE WAS THE WAY FORWARD FOR JONI: I KNOW JAMES IS GONNA THAT'S WHY HE'S BUT WHAT I WANTED RIGHT QUICKLY BEFORE IS WHAT CAN PEOPLE I MEAN, THERE'S ENORMOUS LIGHT. THERE'S ENORMOUS PEACE. THERE'S ENORMOUS JOY. I MEAN, TRY TO, EXPLAIN IN A WAY THAT WOULD HELP WHY YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GO.
