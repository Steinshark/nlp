Welcome to Sad Boyz, - and other things also. I'm Jarvis. Falling into the guest zone. Whoa, you're falling. Oh, you're going into the guest zone, It's full of fire! Oh, no. Yeah, you have to - Oh, no, it's hell! - Is this because of what I did? And beneath the depths of hell, I guess, - is our guest, Hank Green! [JORDAN] Welcome to hell Yeah, no. I... I live in Montana, so it's just - Oh, I see. Yeah. - because a lot of Angelenos - - Ohhhh. This morning, I was waiting next to some LA people, - and they were all like (shivering). And in puffy coats, and I was like, - &quot;It's... 68deg.&quot; I don't understand - I mean, LA people get so excited to finally use - with intent to wear the same day. They were nice people. People dripped out, getting heat stroke, but knowing that it's I enjoyed the drive, honestly. - Yeah? People were driving slower, and I was like, - &quot;This is how we should be.&quot; The past couple years but people freak out - And I'm from Florida as well. - And (inaudible) - - &quot;This is light drizzle.&quot; There is a pride, I feel like, still, probably imbued in all of us, that comes from, like, (scoffs) &quot;Oh, you can't handle this?&quot; Yeah. &quot;LA people can't&quot; - you know what? - I have a hot take. - This is just for the LA people. - No. I think that LA drivers are good. - [JARVIS] Ohhhhhh! I disagree, but continue. So, let me tell you why I think that. First - first clue... The guys on the motorcycles - are doing some stuff, right? - And they... - are still alive. - Something must be going right. I think they do the equivalent but also are professional - I don't know. Those people scare me. [JORDAN] Also, you're It's true. We get Number two: there's a place, um, in downtown LA where my GPS was like, &quot;OK, get on the interstate now.&quot; I was like, &quot;All right,&quot; and pulled onto but it was just a stop sign. And you stop, and the interstate and is going full interstate speed, - like 30 feet before there's a turn. allegedly the first highway in America. In front of you, you have - Mmhmm. - Yeah. It's the most stressful part - of everyone's day. I can't go back.&quot; Like, I just go. That is true. I feel like LA drivers the roads got built before and they have to figure that out. Right. That highway - Yeah. - You couldn't go that fast. So, a third thing, uh, I feel like everybody - [JARVIS] Mm. you stop at a stop light, the light turns green; the person - (Jarvis laughing) you're 40 cars back, the light turns green; We're all sort of, like, as a unit. We know how to do it. We do it Let's go.&quot; And if you're not, - [J &amp; J] Yeah. if you beep at a person - So I - World War I, where nobody knows and ultimately no one wants to be. They're like, &quot;Well, it's Christmas. One day. I don't know. but then the moment you transgress - I feel like it seems like because you see 40,000 of them a day. [JORDAN] And they're I can't speak for because I didn't get my driver's license - But I took driving lessons in LA, and so I drove around LA telling me the rules of the road, and I would ask questions, because I would be like, &quot;They're not and they were like, &quot;Nope,&quot; - Like, &quot;You have to be prepared for...&quot; For doing that, yeah. I guess this could be everywhere, - (stammering agreement) And if you're on the highway engage defense mode, because someone's gonna - not realizing they needed to, - and just doing like a four-lane merge. I am finally getting my US license We're teenagers. We're young and hip. I'm young as hell. You tried TikTok? - Yeah. Heard of it. - Yeah, dude. All of the above. - Young, present stuff. Uh, but I just did all the and, by far, driving automatic so the driving is fine. You have to drive manual in the UK. - Yeah. Whereas the written test here is a little more jazz. you know, some highly-specific question and then, &quot;How many wheels does the &quot;'Round and 'round? - Yeah. &quot;Had a _____.&quot; &quot;Hmmm...&quot; - &quot;No!&quot; - you can just take it again. Right there. And I got in a car I like to think of myself as, I wanna be a little flexible - You know me. Bad guy. But I... I was in a car They've been driving We're zipping down the freeway. And then as we were going down, and then they were like, &quot;By the way, 'Cause I've never thought about it,&quot; They've operated in drive and neutral their entire time. They were like, - &quot;What's the 2 and the 1?&quot; - Ohhh. - and they're like, &quot;Why?&quot; you wouldn't need them much. - I couldn't think of a reason. if you drop down to a lower gear My foot's reaching for - Yeah. Now it's a Flintstones car, with the foot. So, cars. But what are we here for? Who knows? This is what we CAN be here for. There's no rules. is that we all have the same birthday. - What?! - Yeah. - All of us? - 1992 for moi. That's wild. That's very special. I know. 'Cause we met and had a lot of other similarities, and then we found out that we had the [HANK] Yeah, that's wild. Yeah, so shoutout to us and, like, Adele, - I think, maybe? Yeah. Jacques Cousteau. - Oooh! - Karl Marx, maybe? - Yeah. - Yeah. It's a conspiracy, confirmed. You're not gonna believe this, We've been watching conspiracy videos but just someone speaking It has, like, the background - &quot;Doo-doo-doo-doo!&quot; - &quot;Whooooa!&quot; - &quot;But I didn't.&quot; It's like, &quot;OK, this is a - This is a Crash Course history, actually.&quot; You have to put it in the right frame [JARVIS] That's true! The packaging matters. As for what we're here for today, Hank, we're here for you. - Uh, you're here in Los Angeles. Um, you've been here for a bit. You've done a couple of shows. One of those wasn't planned? Well, it was very short. It was planned eventually. I wasn't planning on doing it. going to a comedy show And I was like, &quot;Well, then I'll just miss this show 'Cause I don't like to plan 'cause you never know. Oh, I think think I'll be tired. - (Hank laughing) - That's not a concern of mine. Yeah. I love a thing. And so the show got canceled, and I was like, &quot;Aw.&quot; And then I was... I had a friend who knew a guy and I was like, &quot;Hey, And I had 20 hours - and when I was on the stage. And it was very scary. 'Cause they were like, &quot;Yeah, you can book it - [JARVIS] Mmhmm. They were like, &quot;Give us your credit card - And they charged me. - [JARVIS] And you had to make it work. You had the exact opposite - Yeah, I did. Unfortunately, we had a birthday So it was like one of five so, &quot;OK, can't make it to the show.&quot; - But how'd it go? No, I mean, I've done three now, How recent is this? 'Cause you would say it's like stand-up. Yeah. It's like a one-man show/stand-up thing. - [JARVIS] Mmhmm. I'm much more... Like, it's a story. It has a beginning... I got cancer. It has an end. - &quot;Here's what cancer made me think about.&quot; - Um... at least my perception of you externally, It's weird to call a thing Yeah, it's me-coded. - But yeah. Yeah, but it's you-coded in that - I know you as a artifice online. - [JARVIS] You see? - Hank Green, The Brand-coded. - Yeah. Turns out, I am mostly me. I like to say that, on the internet, everything you see is me, - Yeah. - Yes. I ascribe to that, for sure. - Just a crop, yeah. What do you feel like you're very conscious - Keeping out of the crop? Yeah, I mean, I like to be sort of like aggressively non-sexual on the internet. Uh, so... You know, obviously that I have, like, equipment; - that I'm a man. - Like, male paraphernalia. - Yeah. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; You're talking like a robot - [JARVIS] &quot;You assume I have appendages.&quot; - What do we do here? Whatever we do with something, I've heard. I know. So, that's a thing. I think that some people like to have that as part of their persona, I, uh - you know, I... Like, I have a child, and so figuring out the I feel like, for a long time, but not showing pictures. But now he's becoming a person, and so it's a little bit right on the edge of being comfortable telling the story. Because at some point you know, have friends, and people will be like, &quot;This is a story about you Right, and instead of like an uncle it's some rando from the internet - who knows too much about you. That's fair. That's respectful, 'cause... Do you ever get secondhand feelings? I don't wanna say there's a lot of people and not thinking about these things. I try to not... I'm pretty good at not judging people. - [JARVIS] Yeah, that's good. But what if they're wrong? I... what if they're wrong? [JORDAN] What if they're bad? Like me! Uh, you're a very bad man. - That's very me-coded. before we started. Yeah. It was all bad stuff. - He had to get it out of his system. Well, you can't say it, - because it's illegal. In fact, he said it and we had to - because we got demonetized. - Quit that! Yeah. I mean, I... There's just a lot of ways Yes. I do agree with that. My wife and I say, - Everyone is them-coded. That's a little saying we have. We have that conversation with one another or the guest, How's that for your wife, as well? She's been present Yeah. No, I wasn't a YouTuber and we had been together - So... [HANK] Yeah, a little bit weird. I got cancer and I was like, She was like, &quot;You've thrown me - Valid. things got weird in our relationship.&quot; Uh, yeah, I... I think it's super weird for her. And she's a pretty private person. strangers coming up to talk - And so she just walks away. They're like, &quot;Did she - ?&quot; &quot;That's not yours. That's... she...&quot; - [JARVIS] &quot;She didn't opt in to this.&quot; I mean, you must have, at this point, a template for that You're amongst the most that exist in the world. Yeah, that happens a fair amount. And I... Uh, I like it, to some extent. Like, usually it's really I never really know what they know me for. Mmhmm. Well, we got that on our thing. - [HANK] What does it say? by what people recognize you from?&quot; I mean, it is... Not really, because it's been so long. But for sure, there was a time. I remember the first time - - I went to Penny Arcade Expo, and, uh... And I usually, like everyday places, get recognized, at that point, But at PAX it was like all SciShow. - Ohhh! &quot;I've never been recognized - Wow. And different kind of nerd. Uh... And so that was a surprise, but that was many years ago. And so now, like, I never know, you know? But, like, I can guess. I can look at a person and be like, Like, Vlogbrothers, I can look at a person has seen me make a joke on TikTok.&quot; &quot;And they know nothing.&quot; Usually people, for us, will lead with it. Which is interesting; - &quot;What do you know me from?&quot; - Yeah. Someone came up to us and had only seen us on TikTok, which is just strange for us, 'cause it's not even a thing It's just our editor Austin makes TikToks. God, I was so excited about the that I didn't even really I was like, &quot;Oh, but the...&quot; We're in line for the chicken sandwich. It is fun, though. I was getting, um, coffee with Tom Scott last week, and the barista had like a, &quot;What is this, a crossover 'Cause we've never been... People don't know that we know each other. Yeah. We were at the - I came out after the show and I was taking a picture and the Backyard Scientist was at the show. And he was like, &quot;Is Then William Osman was behind him; [JORDAN] &quot;Am I dreaming?!&quot; Yeah, I think there was didn't recognize Tom at first, and then Tom made a reference is taking a step back from YouTube, and they were like, &quot;Oh, yeah. I've seen one Tom Scott video. - It's the one where you retire.&quot; &quot;I didn't connect to it - 'til you said you were going away.&quot; - &quot;I know you from leaving YouTube.&quot; have a chip on my shoulder, got more views than my and it's like, I don't know. - It's better. It's a meritocracy. I did not, like, get lifted away You've gotta... I mean, you gotta go to the countryside - and walk while telling the story. - I really was not in the mood. - of my personal health update.&quot; You gotta do something like that. Yeah. I was not - I was like, &quot;Oh, god.&quot; - Yeah, you had other things top-of-mind. &quot;Spoiler alert!&quot; - He didn't spoil the reveal. He was vague. But I could've been like, &quot;Big news. Very upsetting. Health update.&quot; Yeah, we have feedback - Right, you have to workshop it. - [JORDAN] One of you pog-facing. I could've done better, I think you're allowed to. Oh, yeah. That's the thing. That's why I can say it out loud. You get cancer; you're allowed to do - - You're allowed to. - Hell yes. Like, you go on a long... a long journey with that, um, and I mean... You know, that's a chapter that is - resolving, would you say? - When does any door close? I am in remission, is the technical term, so there's no sign, at least of any cancer in my body. And the kinda cancer I have, it would be pretty unusual for it to come back in the next five years, and then after that they call you &quot;cured.&quot; - [JORDAN] Oh, OK. If it's gonna come back, But it's so unlikely that they don't [JORDAN] In those 2 years, - they don't even check? - scan of the treatment plan. The only reason I'd have another scan So I just have to be constantly aware - [JARVIS] Yeah. &quot;Is knee pain a cancer thing?&quot; [JORDAN] Are you, like - I mean... I think a lot of people are probably... I mean, thrilled, but also surprised by the progress made - &quot;Oh, great, positive news.&quot; Were you surprised? - I think maybe - - time moved slowly. But now it doesn't anymore, It's very hard to remember anything. I'm just curious if it is - I feel like I, has kind of a warped perspective on - &quot;Cancer&quot; is kind of a - &quot;Oh my god! It's crazy! It's always&quot; - But I guess you don't hear a lot of stories - of success so much. It's just changed so much, Uh, I have a friend who got the same cancer as me 10 years ago, - and his experience was much worse. Uh, he had to have Even though he was pretty early-stage, too. Um, but yeah, so the thing is, like... We talk about cancer like it's a thing, - but it's like 100+ things. It'd be like saying, like, - &quot;I got virus.&quot; - Oh, yeah, &quot;the virus.&quot; &quot;The ills.&quot; - &quot;Is it AIDS or is it a cold? Uh...&quot; - &quot;Who's to say?&quot; So, I mean, I've learned so much Uh, you know, I have people I did a bunch of comedy in Missoula. And, like, you can like, once you're in it, within like three exchanges - Mm. in the front row, and his wife was like, &quot;He's a cancer patient!&quot; and And he's like, &quot;Well, we've had a lot...&quot; And she was like, &quot;He's had 11 surgeries!&quot; - and I'm like, &quot;That's bad.&quot; That means that - you don't have - Right. - Yeah. And he was like, &quot;In the wait-and-see.&quot; And what that means is... - &quot;We're not treating it anymore.&quot; So, that's like a way of saying &quot;terminal.&quot; But everybody in the audience - [JARVIS] Right. - I suppose. So, you know, I'm also but that's not what you'd say. - You'd say, &quot;I'm in remission.&quot; [JORDAN] Do you get a - maybe before official diagnosis, and the reality of the situation? [HANK] Yeah. I mean, it took me Well, I guess not. (laughs) It depends on what you mean. So, I wanted a lot of hard numbers, and I found that they were Like, there are things that you know, but you have to understand So, once I was staged, it was like the, you know, five-year, uh, mortality is 5%, - which is, like, low, but high. You know? That's a lot higher And there's lots of things At the moment I started taking chemo and I could tell that that number gets smaller. Because for some people, The cancer's just not responsive - [JORDAN] You can tell physically? - Wow. I couldn't close my armpit - Oh, wow. like, squishier. - Like the lymph node was squishier. Instead of being like a ball, - Ooh, yeah. when people are like... Uh, a friend of ours had, um... I can say it, 'cause he talks about it. A lot of his stand-up - He had brain cancer. He's jovial about it, but it's annoying &quot;Wow, what an inspiration,&quot; - [HANK] Yeah. I feel like there must've been Yeah. I mean, bad things happen; That's part of what where I was, like, so sick, &quot;What if I could make something that is And it would be good for people, and then it would be like a... You know, not a reason I got sick, - [JORDAN] Mmhmm. what I'd like mostly is for of what it actually is that, like... It's 2024. Uh, more people who get cancer - die of some other thing than of cancer. And that's not how it feels. You know? That's not what you think. And also, like... You know, but like, obviously.. still a lot worse than if you get a virus. You know? Chances are, if you get a virus, you'll be better in three days. - [JARVIS] Yeah. Like, we haven't cured - People go, &quot;Why haven't we cured cancer?&quot; &quot;Did you hear about virus?&quot; Kinda famously haven't cured virus. - They keep making new ones, too. Like, people still die of stuff, I mean, the sad fact is because every time you you create more cancer, Mm. Right. - Because it's like an eventuality. - Yeah. Biggest risk factor and the biggest cause So, in order to cure cancer, which I think maybe we - People are trying. - Keep working on it! That guy who's injecting [HANK] Yeah. I'm sure that guy will never - Nothing bad will ever happen to him, every single untested medical treatment on his own body. I think maybe his son will kill him. (all laughing) - Yeah, most common is, uh, patricide. by the thing that we love the most. And that guy really loves his son's blood. Yeah, that's true. Um, jumping back to who is now the icon for YouTubers retiring, in a sense, 'cause Tom, you know - I think he updated - &quot;Probably not forever.&quot; - &quot;Psych!&quot; - (all laughing) But there has been Everyone's going, &quot;What's happening?! I do feel like that comes in waves, but as someone who's been online - for, you know, a very long time, um... - But is young like us. We're all young. [JARVIS] Young and hip. Uh, do you have thoughts on that, just as the page turns I think that it's great to look at... So, like, if you write a book and you finish the book - did you retire from writing books? - [JORDAN] Mm. You finished that book. So, You know, Tom Scott and it's a body of work. And it was - [JARVIS] Right. each video as a piece of work, but then that project where he made a video - and genius videos over and over. It's imposs - like, I do not [HANK] Yeah. Um, that's... That feels like, &quot;OK, he made that.&quot; And now it's not like Tom Scott's like, &quot;OK, I'm gonna move to Florida - Yeah. Well, if he wants. - on the helicopter. - He's like, &quot;Canasta, I'm comiiiiing!&quot; &quot;I didn't mean to grab the helicopter. It was an accident. Help me. I'm dying.&quot; - The update video. - &quot;I'm still on the helicopter.&quot; (all laughing) - Um, but yeah, I totally - where it's like, I think I think, to some extent, and it's a company and it does It's exhausting, in a lot of ways, as a person who is kind of And I think, &quot;Great.&quot; Like, the ability to - like, I have a lot of friends and they're sort of always or blogs or doing copywriting. And, uh... And that's, you know, if they They gotta pay the bills. It's great, I think, for the industry that a lot of people are like, - I don't need to keep doing this.&quot; So, I think that's kind of - [JARVIS] For sure. 'cause it's gonna free up those people - and make different stuff. - Yeah. Tom Scott doesn't seem - Hey, he's walking in the fields. I, um... Yeah, the reason I ask you specifically As someone who, you know, was watching I was like an &quot;Accio Yeah. Front page, I remember, at some point, you and John both were like, - on growing Vlogbrothers.&quot; - &quot;We're gonna focus on other projects.&quot; And that was kind of like - Obviously, it didn't end. 'Cause there was many endings There's the first year of, like, There's the big, &quot;Actually, - we're gonna keep doing this.&quot; - Every video ends. - and I was like, &quot;Oh, it continues!&quot; - &quot;Yay!&quot; You know? Yeah. But, um... And then 18 years later, - Right, but obviously you're doing more. - Like, it sort of fits into a role - &quot;OK, here's what Vlogbrothers is, &quot;We make short videos &quot;And if YouTube changes the videos that do well - we're gonna be like, 'I don't care.'&quot; &quot;You know what does well? the thumbnail, and the topic of there's a way to get people in.&quot; - [JARVIS] Yeah. We are so lucky to have with an audience who's just like, - [JARVIS] Mmhmm. And there's almost a way that, like, people feel more appreciated by just, like, showing them and a title that says what's in the video. I do think we're coming around. I think we've reached - an audience exhaustion point. people are like, &quot;No. I think people have a literacy that maybe they didn't initially. I mean, at one point, Like, literally, &quot;Should I be excited?&quot; It's like, &quot;Yes, you won't believe And now they have the literacy for, &quot;You're lying. I feel like whenever Yeah. MrBeast can't give away because it seems unbelievable, even if he does give it away. And so it's like he's had to sort of And that's, I think... Much like the 2016 loud vlog era of, um, diss tracks and music videos, etc., that exhausted its audience. People became tired of it. And I think it stopped because it didn't... I feel like, in this business, if something is still generating views - it's gonna continue as a trend. And so, like, I think and I think that... I'm seeing a lot more, like, at least just saying, &quot;This is what it is.&quot; I'm not gonna say, I'll just be like, &quot;Someone did this, And it's like, &quot;OK. You're not - It's just very matter-of-fact. - &quot;Look out! They're over there doing it!&quot; and I do think it kinda goes in cycles. like a Vlogbrothers video that you may not get Yeah. I mean, it's very important to remember that, like, capturing attention is not the And, like, you certainly Uh, but like... You don't have to do it every video. Not every video has to be about Some videos are about strengthening Are you tempted to do a lot more stand-up? Is that the next thing that's scaling up? Not... immediately. I feel like I wrote this show, and I was like, &quot;This is...&quot; I wrote a lot of it on stage. Like, I'd go out. and then I built from there. And, uh... And it was a huge amount of work, which I didn't really understand - So it's a lot of work. The whole point of stand-up - Yeah. You're like, &quot;I'm just talking. - This is how I talk, and I'm making...&quot; I was actually watching and as a person who's now done it, I'm like, &quot;Wow, he... This is so... sharp and also not, like...&quot; He's speaking in a character. He's got a character voice. In interviews, he doesn't sound like - John Mulaney on a stage! It's like watching the Olympics - Yeah. &quot;Wow, they just did that!&quot; - Yeah. (laughing) - and he won a gold.&quot; &quot;The water makes you move. Eh?!&quot; Uh, and so I realized it's a lot of work, and I'm also not, uh, I'm not a polish guy. I'm not... like, that's not how I am. I don't go for perfection. - Um... - It does feel - Uh, more than there should be. And, um... But the, uh... - I don't like it that much. Yeah. Well, when I'm doing it, on the stage, I'm like, Beforehand, I'm like, &quot;This is the worst. Afterward, I'm like, &quot;That was terrible. Uh, and then three months later, - I'm like, &quot;I need to do that more.&quot; Uh, so it's like I just forget how much I hate before and after, and I remember how much I love It's the endorphin release that allows people that have - Exactly, yeah. in the same sense that I would say and then later you feel good about it? Yeah. No, I feel bad - So, I feel bad in a weird way It's like a little bit of being critical - every little piece that I messed up. Or... but it's also just I'm so... Like, I think there's like - Where I just crash, and I feel bad. I mean, after our live show, I felt - We recorded; I was like, and I almost felt guilty saying that, 'cause it was like, you know, with our podcast audience and everyone was super excited. And then I was, like, - I couldn't really explain. You've heard stand-up comedians, - and lack of drug use. - Aside from John Mulaney. - &quot;What?!&quot; Like, his show about going to rehab 'cause I was like, &quot;Oh, you can do - Sure. Mike Birbiglia has been, you know, like... - one of my favorite guys, just, like, growing up, 'cause we both grew up And he's a great storyteller, and just... And so many interesting things - [HANK] Yeah. You know, speaking of while still releasing I'm sure if we spoke directly to &quot;Wow, I feel like I know you because First of all, it's been 10 years. Fun fact for any comedy-heads out there, Mike Birbiglia has a 2006 album. - Ohhh. - John Mulaney intros him in it. - Yeah, so he's like - Well, yeah. And John Mulaney's first album, The Top Part, was where - You know, I'm a bit of a stand-up nerd, so I was into John Mulaney Before he was funny. - His first stand-up album is really good. After it was cool too, yeah. Yeah, and he went to - I mean, Mike Birbiglia, Nick Kroll, and... Mike Birbiglia, Nick Kroll, and - [HANK] Oh, cool. a few classes ahead, like was an alumnus who was and Nick Kroll and Mulaney - were on the improv team or whatever. So, yeah, they all go way back, but... - Comedy's fun. for more stand-up? I don't know. I think that it, uh - There's a functional problem, where I live in Montana. So I can do shows in small theaters in my town. - [JARVIS] Mmhmm. Which I love doing, 'cause we have in 70,000-people Missoula. And so I get to, like... - hang out and feature local talent. And... but the... So, I could do that and work up a thing, - but I can't do a big tour right now. Like, as a dad. - I got too many things I need to do. it's you just got too much stuff to do, But for us, I would just be too tired. I mean, if you're crashing after - [JARVIS] Yeah. This is the trick. So, I got here Tuesday, and I've gone non-stop. That's the trick. 'Cause I don't really have at like 1:00 in the morning Like, I can't feel bad. I have to get in the car And so I'm just sort of coasting, and I will feel awful. Like, Thursday of next week... I should put it on the calendar, like, - Right, a letter to the future. &quot;You are very sad. Your life is fine.&quot; If you went to Vegas and then went home like, - &quot;What is this headache? What the hell?&quot; That's a good idea, though, to give - Like, &quot;Here's my prediction: Thursday and Friday, you're gonna be sad.&quot; I've stopped trying to I know we're doing a long record, like That is, uh... There's not so much a sensation of dropping but there is a sensation of, &quot;Ooh, thinking really deliberately at all - is not an option now.&quot; After a shoot day, like when we're doing SciShow, I'm like... I always think, &quot;I'll do SciShow, we'll finish at 3:00, and then No. We'll do SciShow - and then I'll stare at a wall. I think it's so funny, too, 'cause I never wanna We got a great comment 'cause we were talking about - We accidentally, uh, recorded like a three-hour main episode, and then we did our And we're just kind of sunk into our couch, and just talking, yapping or whatever. And somebody was like, &quot;Long day - (all laughing) &quot;Hoo!&quot; Pull that horn But yeah, it's a charmed - the range of human emotion. What is your relationship with - like, 'cause obviously the stand-up show - is very personal. Um, but then, uh - And so you may have some - Like, you're saying, I'm deviating from the plan,&quot; or whatever. Do you ever feel that with something like a SciShow episode? It's easier to not feel bad because, uh, I'm more empathetic - [JARVIS] Yeah. Uh, and, like, you see other people's choices &quot;That is another person's choice, and... - could be the right one.&quot; You know? Like, I don't know. &quot;It's not how I would've done it, but clearly they thought that was better.&quot; &quot;They thought that was the right way, Um, and also, it's very Like, sometimes, absolutely sometimes, I'll be like, &quot;This script ain't workin'.&quot; Uh, or something like that. Um, but almost always it's just like, &quot;I'm here. I'm doing my job. - You're doing your job.&quot; And, like, the person who's putting this episode out - isn't any of us. It's SciShow. Yeah, so the weight - does not fall on any individual. - That's kinda how we - Yeah, that's kinda how 'cause it's like we wanna be able And so it made sense to invest in a, you know, a team. And we have Jacob now, We've never shown a picture of this, but we've been having We described, like, it's a monitor And we've got a bunch - creature fanart. - No, I see it. like a Cthulhu is beyond conception. - It breaks your brain. The top of a human head, I don't even have my phone right now, It's almost verbatim what it looks like, - and we did not show them a photo of it. - Um... because you can give kudos to other people. - That's refreshing, 'cause there's no - They're probably not gonna They probably have the same doubts. Like, It's nice to be like, &quot;You are... &quot;You're great. I like what this is.&quot; Even if there's feedback, you are as valuable I don't know. I guess it's kind of You see everyone smiling Your channel, my channel, your other once it's out, you're like, - &quot;Look what WE did!&quot; &quot;WE got a subscriber badge,&quot; or whatever. Yeah, I think it's harder to, like, - make pure art that way. Though I do... I think there's ways to do it. But, um... But, like, it's a lot easier to make a... just a good thing. - Mmhmm. but it might never finish or come out. Yeah, or be good, you know? Um, how are we doing? I do have my - It's almost 11:00. I just wanna be on... Yeah. What do you wanna do? intro them, and have a sort of weird section of extra guests? Yeah, let's do that. - Who are we talking about? - Yeah. We do, but I think that people enjoy this. - There's a little bit of a... - Yeah. Because here's the thing - Is it more than one person, - or is it a nonbinary person? But the value of leaving it in the podcast - [HANK] Yeah. &quot;Oh, I'm either gonna scrub forward - Probably. With special guests. - Surprise special guests. Jacob will cut around them. Very aggressively, or dub. - Hire the Marvel VFX team. I will be the least interesting - You can see your mouth open - but I'm used to that. One thing before we jump into this, - 'cause we can also do - We also have our game that - That's true. before this is, like... As someone who's worked and the business side of the creator space, when you see things like the current stuff that Twitch and Twitter are up to, do you have any thoughts? I could say some - is there anything that jumps out at you? - I think livestreaming's really tough. I think that it's, like... You know, it's obviously not... ever going to end. Like, it's a genre, a format, and I think there will be livestreams 500 years from now of some sort. - Just like there are still - - [JORDAN] The Forbidden Zone. There's still radio. - There will still be livestreams. (Jordan imitating a mech walking) - Probably. Um... But I think it's a tough business. It's wild to me that Twitch hasn't, like, figured out Even though there is - [JARVIS] Yeah. I think that we underestimate... how good YouTube is at business. [JARVIS] We underestimate, yes. [HANK] Yeah. Though, like, I have worries about YouTube too. - [JARVIS] Yeah. the people at Twitter have always... like, not been... not been good at figuring out what's valuable about the platform and I don't think that's changed I do think they've overestimated, I think that - yeah, - I think that the current leadership, um - Yeah. I think that there's It's a little like, you know, if I - Here's what I'll say: If I looked at YouTube and I was like, &quot;There are so many problems! and then you put me in charge I did not understand A big day of meetings. &quot;I'm tired. - I need a day off tomorrow.&quot; at this table, and I do not know and if I don't satisfy all of them, Um, and I think that there's where just, like, critics... which is great. We need critics. like, so that that group But I think that, like, you don't understand how It feels like a bunch of people got put in charge and were like, and they won't accept that actually it's very complicated. &quot;Oh, wow, I thought I could do Mulaney. I thought I could just &quot;It looks like he's just talking.&quot; - &quot;He's having a nice time.&quot; &quot;I can do that.&quot; - &quot;I already am on cocaine.&quot; - and then he gets on stage!&quot; I think that - I do think that it is very complex. Um, I think that one thing about YouTube's success that is understated is the fact that YouTube was not... was a very difficult-to-maintain independently, which is why - the Google acquisition made sense. And then Google invested, like, decades and billions of YouTube not making money, investing in capturing market share so that it can flip a switch gigantic business, second most, you know, popular website on the internet, etc. I do not think that Amazon treated Twitch with the same investment. [HANK] It felt like they Yeah, because, having talked or product managers, etc., it feels like the pressure is on them now to find profit. And in this competitive landscape, in the competitive streaming landscape, where now, unfortunately, Kick shouldn't exist. Like, it feels like Kick is the - fumbling of Twitch. And, um, then YouTube - What if Vimeo launched now? I've had some disagreements in person with some Twitch leadership, where they were like, &quot;You don't And I was like, &quot;You don't understand with a company and how expensive when the creators are the ones getting the shit end of the stick, and&quot; - The only people that can advocate for you. The only people that can advocate for you, It's not even a choice, to some extent. They'll be pushed away because it cannot provide for them. [HANK] I mean, the wild thing - is that that is what happened to Vine. But TikTok figured something out. - [JARVIS] Well... I don't even know. Like, - turn the bend to become profitable. And... - It just is so much less cool. - TikTok, I think, is - TikTok kind of is a little bit immortal, - so much cultural cachet. - Like, it has to be something. - Imagine saying that about MTV in 1995. - [JORDAN] I was one year old. TikTok was not playing - because there was Musical.ly, and - But I think it could where it was very cool, - bland American culture. - [JARVIS] Mainstream-ified. - is that it was cool. And now it's not as cool anymore. And YouTube's like - YouTube and Shorts and Reels - [JARVIS] Mmhmm. - [JORDAN] It's honest. We don't have as many advertisements.&quot; &quot;We could get your interests wrong.&quot; - [JORDAN] &quot;Jordan, Joe Rogan?&quot; Do you like transphobia?&quot; Like, &quot;Not really.&quot; They're like, What's wild is that happened Like, the Instagram insert ads I think they were just - They had some sort of Oh, yeah, they had a bad week there. - Something went wrong. and it's just maybe - the worst post you've ever seen. &quot;It seems like a lot of people Even the pro-trans takes, I was like, &quot;You shouldn't say that one. Like, you found a thing - that's gonna make - Well, there's always somebody Like, we all have bad takes. - &quot;This is getting so much engagement!&quot; which is... we talk about, we complain about Twitter But the fact that Elon has now, like, - monetized bad engagement bait, where every reply has been and it's making you watch, &quot;Hey, did you wanna watch a fight?&quot; - It's like, &quot;Uh, no.&quot; &quot;I see you've been looking at What about war?&quot; It feels like, um, I am, like... If I tap in to one of those videos, it is now trying to keep my - [HANK] Yeah. maybe you don't like the fight. - And it's like, &quot;Oh, OK, cool, yeah.&quot; - Like a Venus flytrap. but a race to the bottom that get 500,000 impressions and 3 likes, but it doesn't matter 'cause you got dictates whether or not It feels more like somebody It's like, &quot;No, it's cool, because it looked like my dad, - [HANK] Yeah. &quot;Yeah, you told me about this, I mean, I think it's kind of exciting It was like three years ago, it was like, &quot;Well, YouTube and Google are gonna own the internet forever, I guess.&quot; And now it's like, &quot;Oh, and Google's like, 'I guess we should make And then TikTok is like, &quot;So you thought you had video? And Neal Mohan's like, &quot;I guess - that we've been working on for 2 weeks.&quot; Yeah, and even, um, Threads is like, but Elon said something weird, - and maybe this is the right time.&quot; where you're like, &quot;That seems people at Meta are like, (evil giggling) Elon Musk slips on a &quot;Matt Walsh is pretty epic bacon!&quot; and... &quot;No, no, no. He is a criminal.&quot; - Yeah. get the sensation of or the to adjust the way you present to adhere to some of like doing memberships? I mean, we get money sometimes. Like, TikTok paid me - early on to make science videos. They were like, &quot;We want more educational &quot;We won't pay you to make any old TikTok, we'll kick you some cash We got money for posting YouTube Shorts. - We got money for - Uh... I think we got money - I don't know if we got money or an advance on memberships at YouTube. But I've always felt like That's what is kind of happening right now, where they're like, and just dump a ton of views into it, and then whatever rev share there is, we'll tweak the thing behind the scenes and then people will&quot; - It falls apart pretty quickly. - You can't keep doing it. It's not like Twitter has money to spend. - It's a bad business. They're, like, really - in not a good financial place. - Uh, and so that's gonna be interesting. though, so maybe he'll just keep - Like, you can't trust anything he says. I'm not saying, like - That's not like a &quot;he's a &quot;He says things and then But, you know, &quot;We'll never offer more stock,&quot; - Or, like, &quot;I'll never&quot; - - Of me? Oh, I'm jealous of Elon. Jealous of Elon. You wish you were Tony Stark. You wish you had a bunch of I think there are some things that I might be But mostly not. - His looks. His... jiu-jitsu. It's the... it's the... It's the - I actually can't come up - I'll be honest. It's probably something. - um, for brevity. The, um... I... yeah. I just don't think that - That doesn't tend to work. Like, And it kinda pissed me off when they sort of cloned a Patreon product. - Oh, that was interesting. 'Cause they had done a lot of and talked about how they, and... Yeah, but internally at Patreon I think everyone was always And so when that happened, It wasn't a big scare. However, um... However, it felt like an inevitability. Like, I asked about that I was like, &quot;What if YouTube - [HANK] Yeah. Patreon does have a story. There is kind of an answer to that. There's also a reason that we use Patreon even though it would be easier. We'd probably convert more people, being right next to the YouTube video, to YouTube memberships. Yeah. I think that YouTube - the sort of like - 'Cause in e-commerce, getting the number of clicks down between - is very important. But I don't think that that's because these are people - Sentiment is a huge part of it. but it's not as &quot;impulse buy.&quot; Yeah, but then there's also kind of versus the, um... &quot;I'm giving you exchange - - value exchange for a product,&quot; which, uh... - Yeah, if it's more of a product, then... I became very wary of operating - Like, I saw so many creators getting so much goodwill from people because they began to be - and entitled to things. And that was never 'cause I saw how much, like... how shitty it could be to have someone 'cause they gave you $1 a month. And so I think for us, &quot;You get the extra episode, Not &quot;leave us alone.&quot; but we don't wanna create the idea or the expectation that - yeah. Give you access. Like, you don't want... You don't want people the ability to control you. - [JARVIS] Yes. But Jarvis, engineering; - That's how we met, at Patreon. At the time, the optics of Patreon when I started, and then you started, were very much charity. - That was the branding. E-begging, which had, seemed very viable. Seemed very appealing. That's why there was the But then, as larger creators Patreon's plan was, &quot;We will just rebrand that people will stop thinking that.&quot; - And that just is not possible. It's already a foundational thought. Then, uh... Patreon started investing more in, like, white-label services, things where you can - (inaudible) services, but skip past the aesthetics. Which works great, I don't know if I wanna say which partners that can find a nice hybrid between the branding and the sentiment of, Yeah, like you're supporting it, - but also you're buying something. And for some people, that comes with a tote bag once a year. They don't want the tote bag, or it's more about the support. So it's trying to balance, adequate value?&quot; Because I think you could still... 'Cause you're not gonna get - where you're gonna get to write off I don't think Twitch has figured out - whether it is about an exchange - Yeah. Also, Primes are keeping - are just kind of cooking the books - for the volume of membership. - I don't know, man. I just think, uh... - [JARVIS] It's really weird. - I don't know what's gonna happen. I live for the business drama. I could leave a lot of the drama, - but business drama's very exciting. is whenever I see - Twitch last year - this year laid off 500 people. Exactly. They've lost like 30% to 40% I think closer to 30%. But anyway, that's where I get upset, because I think that those type of - mismanagement and overpromising. But yeah, overpromising to investors, Or you have these, uh - But that shouldn't happen to Twitch, because it's not like they're a, um... - they're a public company. You know, someone at Amazon But I think that - you know, What am I saying? Amazon, - But, um... But yeah, when people invest their... I don't like people losing their jobs, and when hundreds of people something else went wrong. It's wild, yeah. Uh, do you have any issues, or, like, I guess, probably for a long time now, of viewers and fans being surprised that there's infrastructure to what you do, - as opposed to the indie...? that's, you know, it's basically like, me getting diagnosed &quot;It's like I'm on a plane, and there's something wrong with the plane, And then the joke is it's a fake conversation - says, &quot;Yeah, you do. on the anatomy and physiology of planes.&quot; You're like, &quot;Oh, yeah.&quot; And the joke is that was eight years ago, And people in the audience Like, &quot;No, I just said all of - into a camera out of my head.&quot; - Our special guests are here. Pardon the interruption. We are joined by two very special guests. Welcome to the stage - Just kidding. Like you're gonna perform? Ay, ayyy! - And go ahead. - Yeah. - Oh, shit. Oh, the mics are melting. (all laughing) So, uh, Hank... You know, Hank and I and then (laughing)... Hank, in a very Hank-coded way, - said to me - Said to me, &quot;Is it cool if Flyana Boss And I was like, &quot;Yes?&quot; But, like, I wasn't expecting this. - Us too. And we're happy to facilitate I mean, it sounded like We can be. Do you need a ride somewhere? No, I have a Nissan Altima, Yeah, I mean, I've sort of, uh, when I'm coming to LA - which happens once every five years, I'm like, &quot;I need to see And it gets complicated - [JARVIS] Absolutely. in their TikTok live. They were like, &quot;Are you &quot;I like that new song, 'Skateboard.'&quot; - Yeahhh. - Yeah. And then I was like, &quot;I'll DM you.&quot; They said, &quot;You should hang out,&quot; and DMed them and I was like, &quot;How would...?&quot; And then it was like, - And I was like, &quot;Jarvis's house.&quot; I'm glad that that's I was, uh, you know, showering this morning, and I just put on, like, your music, - and I found myself dancing in the shower, -We love that. &quot;I need to - I can't do this. I actually - Hank's about to arrive, telling Christ I'm - Now you feel ready for the day. - Right? and it made me so pissed off. It made me furious. I'm like, &quot;This isn't me.&quot; - Oh. &quot;Where are they?&quot; - It is you. We are you. Oh, yeah. If you think of it, I don't know what music is. Um, I think you guys have - and you're gonna film some stuff. But before we get into that, we did - Jordan prepared a game. Oh! - Lock me up, dude. Yeah, and so - I don't know, Jacob, do you have all the stuff Why does it say &quot;business coach - credit fraud&quot; on the list? Jacob, nothing to pull up yet. - I'll just - - &quot;business coach credit fraud&quot; TikTok? - Oh. Business coach credit fraud. [TIKTOKKER] ...let's go. So, is sign up for QuickBooks. - Then you wanna go ahead and - [TIKTOKKER] I'm gonna send - for $2,100. Yeah, I would tap if my finger - [TIKTOKKER] and then send it over. [TIKTOKKER] Once I receive with the credit card It will then deposit into my bank account. Once I get money in my bank account, I will then pay off the credit card Once I pay off the then call my bank and ask for 'cause my limits are too low. A bonus is that QuickBooks will also give you funding, - Wow. I mean, I a little bit respect the hustle. Oh, yeah. If you didn't know - Yeah. hacks like this on TikTok, where someone - [HANK] Right. Sometimes I think, uh, to people, like, &quot;Are you having a good idea, There was a stand-up comedian about how they had rented a car, but they were late for their flight. So they just drove to the place where you - like, departures area, - and left the car there. And I was like, &quot;That's not a fun - Like, somebody from the rental car place now has to go get the car. It's like when people just say and they're like, &quot;Yeah, I'm not Like, &quot;I don't know &quot;I don't know how to help you Nobody thought to be - [JORDAN] Yeah. Ethics got in the way. called &quot;unethical life-hacks,&quot; and most of them are crimes or if you had compassion for another person. Did you guys see &quot;dark psychology&quot;? - Sometimes, though... - I've heard this phrase. the mafia after you - and then you do what you gotta do. &quot;What you'll notice is and then you can take them - And that's not illegal. - this was a crime if I saw it. Sorry. I would just think, &quot;OK, - Yeah. It's like, they let you do it. because a lot of people - it gets upvoted, and then - - You couldn't do it if it was illegal. The consumers of educational content are the people learning something and they don't know That's why it is also harmful. - It's also bad. So what happens after just outing themselves Theoretically, they just stop. I think if you do - Baby fraud. - There's a guy who was like, &quot;If you create a business credit card and then you declare - I just bought this $25,000 Rolex, and they can't get it from me.&quot; - Uh, yeah they can. - They can now. &quot;Haters wish they knew this tip.&quot; And then they deleted the TikTok, and then on TikTok they were flexing, like, &quot;People just don't know how I do...&quot; - like, &quot;how I get like this.&quot; [JARVIS] It's like, &quot;Oh, His address and Social Security number. &quot;Yeah, you can turn up if you want.&quot; I have a bonkers story. There's a guy who lived He ran a lumber mill. And then the lumber mill closed down, but he made a good amount of money. And then he started to be and then he moved to the Bahamas, and then they found his body (a collection of shocked noises) - How'd they know it was him? is the best Vrbo in town. Oh, is that where his head is? - I don't think so. But, like, down the valley, he built this giant four-story resort - just for himself on a hot spring, and so just the pool is hot. It's like a giant hot tub. It's amazing. We had our company retreats there And I was like, &quot;Why is this place here?&quot; And then I read this story, and I was like, &quot;Oh, 'cause this man gambled It's funny to live your entire life running a slashing company, a cutting-and-slashing company, - and get beheaded after it closes. - Like, avoid getting anything cut off. And then there's a story and his lawyer is quoted. It says, &quot;As far as I'm concerned, - Oh. - &quot;Judge.&quot; - if the mafia existed. Yeah, he's shaking. &quot;Come on.&quot; It's like, &quot;Just so you know, That's what the mafia says. What was the gang trial recently, where - It was like some RICO case making up new acronyms for what, like... - Oh, like Young Thug. where they're like, &quot;Actually, this means - 'love my mother always.'&quot; And not, like, &quot;the Texas I love great improv lawyers. Like, they get new, undiscovered evidence They have 24 hours And the evidence is like, &quot;We saw him holding the sword, They're like, &quot;No.&quot; - &quot;You're - that - bull. Bullshit.&quot; &quot;I was actually there, - &quot;Incorrect.&quot; There's like a few options, So we can just do one. My god, I should've asked - Mm. - Can I go upstairs? - Why not? Yeah. Yeah, &quot;Is this how - &quot;I remember in the '90s...&quot; That's too much power I don't think I'd fit - but some of them. - [HANK] Yeah. - Yeah, it was a thing. - unlike you people. - Yeah, 'cause we're 42. - It was a great time, right? - &quot;Right?&quot; - We all were jumpin'. (all laughing) Yesterday we were on live, and - We haven't seen him in so many years. I don't feel as though to tell everyone they are lying? - I think he might just go, like, &quot;Yeah. Uh, shit. Definitely.&quot; I think they say Uh, and so we went to high school together. - Yes. - It was a musical arts high school. - Oh. Uh, yes, of course it was. And you were gonna Venmo me $200. - Don't ruin the improv! Ahh, yes, but I fixed it. - And we're doing cash. No, but seriously, - Me and the mafia. - and then take that money - - ...into another one. Yeah, and ask the bank for more money - on the credit card. ...is gonna be like, &quot;Here's $40,000!&quot; - We have some TikToks you can watch. &quot;It said in the TikTok. Have you seen those real estate &quot;Well, if you take $1 million and split and it's like, &quot;Where did If you're already in real estate, - Yeah. You guys said that - (both) Yeah. - (all laughing) And Hank, I've seen through many a Short - that you do not like conspiracy theories. Grand conspiracies? - &quot;Sometimes they're grand.&quot; - As you do. No, with some friends. And it takes place in 1968. - And, uh - - Yeah. The first one. Not Rise of Gru, Uh, and... Uh, and it's before - - It's Gru as a kid, - and the Minions are... The Minions appear to be immortal beings - that have existed since humans. Uh, or before that. - They were tadpoles in early oceans. - Abraham Lincoln's assassination. - They're in the audience. That's a conspiracy theory I'm into. - Behind the motorcade. the Minions are sort of traveling around, and they stumble into a soundstage - And I was like, &quot;Fuck you, Minions movie people!&quot; - That's actually hilarious. That joke's not for me. - It's not for me. - &quot;Oh, they just like - what the hell?&quot; - &quot;That's me.&quot; Through the screen. - &quot;I can't control him!&quot; of flat-Earthers accidentally - that proves the Earth is round? They take the lawyer route, being like, - &quot;This is... the test was wet.&quot; - &quot;Something's wrong with it.&quot; I saw some TikTok of a man holding a long stick of some sort over a cliff, and being like, &quot;See?&quot; And I just really thought Poking China. - &quot;Look!&quot; &quot;There's no curve.&quot; &quot;If the Earth was curved, - Exactly. &quot;Why?&quot; - &quot;How come I ran?&quot; If it's flat, where's the edge? - I just wanna know. Those people live in fear Have you ever been It's the San Andreas Fault. Do they believe in space? - Uh, this is the wild thing. - But it's only up? about whether the other planets - Ohhh. - Yeah. - in Earth, but nowhere else. you can see how the light shines on them, and it wouldn't do that so some people are like, - but Earth is flat.&quot; - [FOLAYAN] I get it. curves of the moon. You can only see it from... - Yeah. What do I know? They're trying to figure it out. It definitely looks like a circle, - Pull it up? - Pull up &quot;the moon&quot;? That is actually how - &quot;Jacob, pull that up?&quot; - &quot;Jamie, pull that up?&quot; &quot;Oh, yeah. Crayon. That's the moon.&quot; - But I pulled up - - I pulled up a couple conspiracy theories. - How you gonna gamify this? - That was really good. &quot;Pulled up a couple conspiracy theories. [JORDAN] That actually means a lot. - Do you really think that? - [FOLAYAN] Career change. I wanted to do that, and - You have a great voice. [FOLAYAN] We're looking for - [JORDAN] Which one do I get to be? - Ohh. OK. I'm not too old? - No, we're 42. - I do wanna get - I do wanna get it on mic that, one of the first things Hank says was, - I was thinking you don't include that. - I thought that was really sweet. Imagine if you said, - on TikTok.&quot; &quot;You guys look so old. - You look like a couple of 42-year-olds.&quot; I guess say whichever one If you're not online, be like, And then in the live, &quot;I thought you were ugly, - Right. - but in person, hoo!&quot; - but now, live, wow. It's better.&quot; - &quot;It's better.&quot; when they find out our ages. Because people are like, - Oh! you're supposed to shrivel up and die, - No, you want to. - Yeah, you settle for podcasting. - when you walked in the room. - That's great. - It's not where it is. - Yeah, we're really old. - What'd you think I was? - I know that I'm leading from the front. - You know, I'm not here - - all have the same birthday. - That's so cool! - Uh, May 5th. - Is it May 5th? - Oh, we have a friend with that birthday. And here he comes. - It's a great holiday. All right, Jordan. - Oh, yeah. Uh, yeah, I'm young as hell. There's, uh, one in particular, I found one of my favorite ones. - Of all the conspiracy theories. you're younger? - Like a year? Yeah, so in Ethiopia you're younger. Yeah, you're a different age. - It is. - 'cause that would help me. Half Kenyan, yeah. - So I'd be half a year younger. - It's the same shit, dude. - so I'm pretty sure it's similar. - On the maps, it's so small. - That's what I do. Mostly, kind of. I have some keywords for this conspiracy. You guys try and guess what it is. What the full conspiracy is. And then we'll do three quickie rounds, and once either somebody gets it, - we show it? Of course. I think it's gonna be like, and it's like they used forks &quot;How come they never ate any food &quot;This is one small bite for man...&quot; - Wow. Uh, I'm gonna go with... OK. &quot;Ocean moon.&quot; &quot;Ocean moon&quot;? The aquatic theory? - What's that? - Oh. - &quot;Ocean...&quot; Is that all we get? - I can give you another guess, but... - What, that it exists? That the tide has never been high. - That's not bad. by just like a bathtub sloshing around. - As we go around the sun. - It's God's bathtub. - God's taking a bath. It is, uh, about - OK. I can give you another hint, - Um, the structure of the Earth. &quot;Moon, ocean.&quot; - Really close. The moon... The ocean is the teardrops of the moon. - Yeah. - That's so sweet. - Wow, I like that theory. - That's sweet. - Right. Um, no. Next term I can say is &quot;firmament.&quot; - Of the Earth. - Definition? The firmament is, like, the idea that there's like a ceiling... - Oh, like a dome? the stars are just holes OK, the dome theory? I feel like there's gotta be I was thinking inner too, There is a conspiracy theory - inside the Earth. - Is it that one? Is it the dome theory? - Fer-menter-tature. - I know what fermentation is. - I'm sending the link to Jacob right now. - Do you not have it? - Ohh. - Oh, don't look. - I think we're gonna get the reveal. There's a lot of unexplained things Hold on real quick. I do not trust them. - Just watch the video (inaudible)... by going through the ocean. You can't get to the bottom of the ocean, because outer space is the ocean. - Whoa. - Uh, spoiler, nothing else. - In this video. It literally just goes, &quot;It's in the ocean. - OK, so... so that the FBI can't see. - They were already closed! - Yeah. - So, you get to Mars through the ocean? where she gets really, like, - stretched in? That was awesome. [TIKTOKKER] Y'all, There's a lot of unexplained (inaudible)... - I didn't even notice that. &quot;Just listen to her!&quot; So, Jack from the Titanic - His body is like... - Whoooa. - that you can reach from the ocean? - All the others are... - I think so, yeah. - Is that a...? Yeah, that seems like the first place. The ocean is like portal, - like a wayport through... - below the ocean would be space. You guys don't know anything about science. Flat space. - Flat space. - Space is also flat. It's just a drawing. It's like when, uh, - Wile E. Coyote draws a tunnel. - in each direction forever. space is up. - Space seems to be up. - It's everywhere. - No it's not. - you do get to space. Dude, look at the space. - No, but if you look into - - Most of all, it's the rug. you can see your reflection. - Ooh. - Listen to her! - (Jordan groans) Yeah, are you up or are you down? - I don't know. Who am I? Am I an illusion? Am I just Right. Maybe it's just a reflection. Yeah, maybe he's the real guy. Maybe I'm dreaming now, and when I'm dreaming, that's real life. - Nah. Yeah, I love that one. I do like that. - That's my favorite. A dream is a wish your heart makes. - I heard that one before. - Did you make that up? - It was really good. - I think I will. It's full. - I'm doing guitar. one more conspiracy One that isn't true, unlike that one? Unlike that one, which is - and Hank corroborated it. Oh, wait, #conspiracytheory, #scary, #firmament! They gotta reach the audience. - He's just using the hashtags. - #hoax. by searching these hashtags, right? Yeah, I'd search &quot;firmament.&quot; My homepage on my PC is the &quot;firmament&quot; hashtag. - Because I'm checking. Yeah. I checked it, and they And then Hank says no. One guy. OK. - &quot;Firmament&quot; is such a great word. to every episode of SciShow, - &quot;OK. Bullshit.&quot; &quot;Let me check,&quot; and I'm just on my phone. You need to stitch it - &quot;Vaccines for peanut butter?&quot; - Blocking the blinds. You go, &quot;Don't listen to him!&quot; Um, actually, this one's truly deranged. The first clue I will give is &quot;China saw us.&quot; - &quot;Chinasaurus&quot;? - Oh. (laughing) - Chinasaurus, yeah? - Chinese dinosaurs. - The British were the first people... Like Jurassic Park, but with - Yeah. &quot;Oh, Jesus.&quot; - Wait, is this the weather balloon? - &quot;China saw us.&quot; - Was it the spy balloon? - Specifically, I don't know. That's real. - Yeah, they got satellites. - Yeah, they're... - They're under this rug, actually. of spy devices everywhere. 'Cause then they'll say some, like, - like, stuff about... you know, how there's more surveillance and, like... I don't know. Is this about a person named China? - Mm. - It's about fine china. - Blac Chyna - - Blacsaurus. OK, Blac Chyna rides - destroys the whole place. Mmhmm. Oh my god. That's why Oh my god. Finally, someone cracked it. God, I want a chai right now. - I'm gonna Minecraft myself with a chai. - Uh, second clue - - Chai tea. Second clue, &quot;no Camarasaurus.&quot; - What? - You gotta spell now. - Did you say &quot;camera&quot;? - Oh. Yeah? Is that true? - Oh, you're joking. - What is happening? - No Americans in the band! - I don't have an accent like that. - Three members! - I can't do it. When we fall asleep. You two are kicked out. Just the boys! - Y'all are Flyana Boss? That's a good thrash metal name. &quot;No C-A-M-A-R-A-S-A-U-R-U-S.&quot; So, it is - we did get a -saurus, - as well as a sauce. - Maybe China saw something - - Oh. If you go down in the toilet, - Yeah. - Me too. - that are just... and I gotta pretend like - Yeah. I'll be honest. Most of the time was taken up that also sound somewhat related to China. - Oh. You just made that up. - OK. Jeff Goldlocktopus? - Jeff Goldlodicus. Jeff Gold... longo-put-lodicus. (laughing) Give me the phone. - Need I say more? - Hank, I'm pretty clear. &quot;We have a very special guest,&quot; &quot;Someone's gonna They're gonna go to - &quot;What is happening?!&quot; I'm here by myself. - &quot;Anyone?&quot; Wait, so was that the second clue, - or you were tricking us? - Can you not get it? - 'cause I'm very confused. - &quot;China saw us.&quot; - &quot;No Camarasaurus.&quot; there's no evidence of it. You know? No Camarasaurus. - Oh. - OK, so... but I made it sound like a dinosaur. - A little bit. Jurassic Park, Jeff Goldblum, - So there are dinosaurs? So, is this about dinosaurs, or what? Well, the final piece of evidence is - Actually, maybe it was proven, because reportedly saw it on the news itself.&quot; Oh. She was on vacation That is a one-to-one... - Ooh! I don't believe you. - Oh. China Dinosaur Theory. - China Dinosaur. Theory. - That looks cute. Ooh! &quot;For vacation.&quot; She saw it on the news. Itself. - (gasps) That's very exciting. - Isn't that a movie? It was a comic. It was like - I read when I was a kid. Yeah, you, like... You get in a car - and then you're marooned And it's Dinotopia, where humans - Cute. on a not-surprise island? - &quot;Oh. England.&quot; - Yeah. but may I remind you, - reportedly saw it on the news itself.&quot; - I think... I think that this was - Oh, yeah. - from the voice, the text, the visuals. You can just be like, 25 conspiracy theory TikToks?&quot; And it's like, &quot;I'll put them - Yeah. Yeah. - We might take that. - Yeah. - We'll just add an addition. - No. But can you ask ChatGPT - to make a good fraud scheme? - OK, a quiet Ponzi scheme. You could do a full fraud video, and right at the end go, &quot;Just kidding.&quot; - I don't know if I like that. I'm not down with fraud. All right, good. We don't have to do fraud. - Cop. Narc. Yeah, allegedly not down with fraud, - Flyana Boss. What's the most fraud you ever did? (all laughing) That's a great question. - What is the most fraud I ever did? Yeah, take off those glasses. I'm just thinking. I can check my Notes app and see what's the most There was actually a woman in China - You made that AI video, huh? - We'll see how many views it's got. - That's kinda fraud. I've plagiarized every essay - Whoa, that's a lot. They were too heavy to hold, I feel like you're not telling Eh, I still didn't read any of the books. But I did, uh... You know, there's a thin line - and saying the words. &quot;I remember there was this guy - I think the same thing.&quot; - That's not too bad a fraud. - What about you? - Oh, no. What's the worst thing you've ever done? So, OK, this is one where I did, um... I only did it once. Because I was curious. So... - [HANK] A little fraud-curious? - In college... In college, we had these - you could tap your student ID. You reminded me of a fraud I did. - Should we go through every crime? You know, I was a computer science major. I was thinking about Um, I wanted to get and you tap your card, and And then you type in the number, B5, You know how vending machines work. And so, uh, I was like, &quot;Interesting that it loads up the balance before the transaction.&quot; &quot;But then it doesn't deduct those things from my card balance until after the transaction's completed.&quot; And so I looked behind the vending machine - [HANK] Ohhh. - to test to see if it did validation... - Yeah. and it didn't charge me. So I figured out how to steal - from the vending machine. But I never did it again, 'cause I was just curious. - Uh... Exactly, yeah. It was an Yeah. That's what I said to the dean of students - &quot;Professor, you don't get it.&quot; - That's not that bad. that's not fraud, but... OK, not a lot of people know this, but e-mails can be spoofed. - Mmhmm. you don't really know if an e-mail unless you look at the actual, like, the source of the e-mail, So I could have any e-mail address and send an e-mail saying it was from Hank, and it would appear as if it was from Hank. Things like Gmail now do a better job But back in the day, this was a real thing. So when I was in college, sent a, uh... sent a fake job posting. Do you remember Portal? - The game? Yeah. [JARVIS] So, yeah. Everyone re - OK, sorry. Forget I said &quot;Remember Portal?&quot; - We remember it, too. Uh, a group of students sent an e-mail with a fake job posting - Ohh. in trouble, like a lot, because people thought they hacked... - Ohh. which would be a big cybercrime. But it's not what happened; But all these computer science professors and they were like, And they had to, like, some of them got kicked out of, uh, class for a certain amount of time, had to go into a - It's a prank, bro. It's just a prank, bro. - It's just a prank, bro. it was pretty early in the internet, and there was a Listserv Like, there was an e-mail that would e-mail everyone in school. - Which is a very bad idea. Uh, and at one point, somebody wrote, like, to that thing and they were like, after going to the bathroom.&quot; And then a professor wrote back and was like, &quot;No you don't.&quot; - Oh, hell yeah, dude. And he was in the &quot;holding hands&quot; class. And then, like, the &quot;Yeah, you do.&quot; Early in the pandemic, &quot;I mean, they're saying EVERY time. Like, now you have to wash - Yeah. it just says 'employees.' - &quot;My hands are dirty!&quot; - &quot;There's rules, and I'm following them.&quot; It's all jazz, baby. I feel like I need to say - because I said that I did one. When I was in college, there was this thing where you could sign up to have them and for all the time you spent you'd get paid a little bit of money. And there'd just be like a pop-up ad And I installed some - faked that your mouse was moving around and left my computer running all the time. And then they also had an affiliate program where you get paid if other people like, used the service. So I got everybody at college and told them about the thing - that moved their mouse around. - &quot;I took 5% of the vig.&quot; - went out of business. - That's significant. I think 'cause of me and people like me. I think I wasn't the only one So, how much money did you make, - at the most? - Oh, that's good. - Uh, 1999 to 2000. Pull up the statute of limitations. I think I'm good. I think went on to other, better things. One time in college, they, uh - The bursar's office accidentally deposited $10,000 into my account. And then I got an e-mail threatening to expel me from school And I was like, &quot;I didn't do this.&quot; - What happened to &quot;finders keepers&quot;? &quot;Please? Pretty please?&quot; Also, &quot;Hey, we made a mistake.&quot; - I didn't steal it from you. It was weird. - &quot;Hey... you're not gonna believe this.&quot; I was just like, &quot;Ahh!&quot; &quot;There's no way this is gonna turn around.&quot; &quot;I spent it already.&quot; Yeah, &quot;I bought 9,999 things. My B.&quot; - &quot;Shoot.&quot; I did once get my, uh, debit card payment information stolen, because This is when I was in college and I was like literally any amount. I got an e-mail from Lloyds Bank, which was my bank, and after I sent my credit card information and the UK equivalent of an SSN, I noticed that the website - was &quot;labradorsavailable.net.&quot; - No! Why that one? They should have, like, - &quot;LloydsBankTime.com.&quot; - earlier that day. - really wanted a Labrador. Somebody with a bunch of - &quot;Now I have to be LLoyds Bank!&quot; &quot;The cutest problem ever!&quot; - &quot;And no website.&quot; - about the Labradors I have.&quot; All right. Well, this was super-duper fun. - We've never frauded, by the way. We didn't even expect it, - Yeah. I thought, um... I got frauded on, you know? - You got frauded on. a homeless man was a hipster, and I invited him over to my house. - To my apartment. It was like my first week I'm from Texas. I'm from Dallas, Texas. - Mmhmm. - Yeah! Are they homeless, or are they a hipster? - You don't know out here. He was just like, &quot;Li'l lady, I wanna find myself He didn't say that. Did he fraud you, or just like...? - That was his fraud. - Yeah, that was the fraud. At the end of the night, - and I'm like, &quot;Uh?!&quot; Yeah, that's true. &quot;Ma'am, I've just co-opted - for clout and attention.&quot; &quot;It started that way. At first, And then, suddenly, &quot;Turns out the life of an outlaw You can't sign a lease.&quot; It's OK to be homeless, by the way. - It is. - But not do fraud. - Regardless of your housing status. - gotta do some. - So, hey... - If you get away with it, I don't care. Is it fraud if your drug dealer If you pay your drug dealer and - I feel like it is. but you can't do anything about it - Yeah. I've been frauded. - [FOLAYAN] What were you buying? There's a lot of fraud - Rampant. because I tried to buy a custom and it's been six months I also got frauded about And drugs. Same period of my life. I also got frauded for some - Or during the pandemic. It was on Craigslist, though, - [HANK] Yeah, that sucks. - Oh. - [HANK] Yeah. Nowadays, it's really hard 'cause it's really hard But, uh, I was able to get it activated, but then I gave it to a friend and then we found out like the IMEI number was blacklisted because it was stolen. I was like, &quot;That's why So now I don't buy phones on Craigslist. - That's my tip. - during the pandemic. - It was a fake dog? They're like, &quot;I have so many Labradors &quot;I will meet you at Wells Fargo tonight.&quot; Um, I met this lady at Wingstop. - Well, first she met her on Craigslist. - And then you went... &quot;Meet me at Wingstop, I was like, &quot;OK, please,&quot; and showed me And it turned out to be - [HANK] Totally different. - Wow, you got catfished by a dog. - Yeah, the dog was like... - He was very curly. - Then as he grew, he just grew long. - I've heard of that happening. But I actually loved it. - It was like a mystery box. - You did still take him. - Nice. &quot;My lying little baby.&quot; - Fraudipoo. - Maybe that's why they do it. - Couldn't ask for anything better. I do love the show Catfish, and multiple times I've watched &quot;I really hope it's a dog.&quot; &quot;It'd be so funny if it's just been tapping It's an actual catfish - flopping on a keyboard. - GG. - Well, this was a wonderful time.
