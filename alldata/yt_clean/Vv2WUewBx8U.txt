They live off the weak ones K-O-K-W calling. Come in. K-O-K-W calling. I'm on international They can't bear to see their image. It repels them. I need more mirrors. And this garlic's lost its pungency. There was a time when Now it bores me. I'll settle for coffee and But first there is my life to consider. I need more, lots more. I can't afford the luxury of anger. It can destroy my reason, and reason I've got to find where Uncover every one of them. Now, where did I Madison Street to 31st Avenue. Eleven kills over three years. And there's more than half They're perfect. Just wide enough to keep the flesh How many more of these before they're all destroyed? They want my blood, But, I still get squeamish. Wait... that garlic. I'd better put it back I can't live a heartbeat away I'm out of gas. That means one I can get rid of them later. Right now, I'm out of gas. They're still fresh. But I'll take only what I need. They can wait too. Those mirrors have to be Square blocks to search. How long will I have to I haven't much time left. And now 12 long hours and drive them back to darkness. Morgan, come out. Come out. Morgan, come out. Come out. Robert, help me! Another day. Another day to start all over again. Virge. Virge.

It isn't, Virge. Is that what you really think, I cannot accept half-baked I'm a scientist, not an alarmist. You're whistling past the graveyard. Is that a commentary - We both know how hard you've worked. I just can't accept the Uncle Ben, you promised All right, Kathy. All right. Card tricks. Card tricks. Robert... Is it possible this germ, Anything is possible, Virge. The best brains in the world have with a fine-toothed comb. The germ is visible but it's not like any In what way? It can't be destroyed by any process But with the whole world trying, Mommy, when are we Right now our problem - Hey, Mommy. Mommy! The wind wake you up?

That leaves it in our laps. Well he should be here by now. You two stay on this virus theory Right. - Yes, sir? All right, sir. And what did the great man of science Oh, he's trying, Ben. And nothing works. The streets are swarming that they're throwing And the dedicated with his plodding, - You have a better idea? - At least it involves imagination. An unknown germ is being It's highly contagious, And you don't believe some Let's get to work. And why are they burning the bodies? Because it's the best known way to keep the germ from spreading. That's what we've always - You'd prefer us to believe in vampires? There are stories being told, Bob. By people who are out of Maybe, but there are too many Stories about people who have They're stories, Ben, stories. And why are the infected people Why can't they stand the sunlight? Why are they only seen at night? Come here. - Look. Look! - Now, is this bacilli or isn't it? And this bacilli is found in the blood To show me germs is not to The point is, if there are vampires, Come on, let's get to work.

But believe me, Morgan, When, Doctor? You're the only one who wasn't What's going to happen, Dr. Mercer? Is everybody in the world going to die No, I don't think so. I don't deny that there's some strange But mankind won't be destroyed. The fact that you and I is evidence of that. All right. Let's roll. When? When? I called a doctor. I had to.

So you finally decided to come back. It's alright boy. Good boy. Oh, no. Don't worry, boy. You're going to be all right. There now, we've got You're gonna feel better. Gonna put you down here Got you all cleaned up. You know they're out You poor driven thing. Everything's going to be all right. Nobody's going to hurt you. Everything's going to be all right. All right. You're going to get better. We're going to have lots You'll see. Everything's What's the use? Wait, I'm not going to hurt you. Wait. I'm not going to hurt you. Wait. I couldn't be out here in the You know that they can't Do you want to come with me, - You feeling better? - Would you like a cup of coffee? - You seem very well organized here. My name is Ruth Collins. I was married. I lost my husband. You are alone? - You were married? Children? A daughter. What are you doing? Please, stop! Stop it, please! You're making me sick. Why do you turn away? - You are infected. Infected systems are - You think I'm one of them. You've made up your You can't change the Facts? What facts? That I got sick? I've had a sensitive I saw my husband killed. Torn to I've been wandering ever since. Hiding at night. Sick with mourning, Then you shout at me. You chase me across drag me to this house, when I get sick because you shove you tell me I'm infected. - Where are you going? You can't go out there. - Let me go, I said. In a few minutes the streets - I don't care. Don't touch me. Don't touch me. Don't touch me. You must be hungry. - You know, you should eat. - You seem used to them. I'm not frightened of them anymore, I protect myself against them, Individually, they're weak. Mentally incompetent, If they weren't... they surely would've found a way Come out, Morgan. Hear that? That's Ben Cortman. - He was my friend. He was like a kid brother. If I could find him But you said he was your friend. When I find him I'll drive a stake But you lived through all this. Perhaps I was chosen. That's a laugh. Or perhaps it's because a long time I was bitten in my sleep by a bat. My theory is that the... the bat had previously By the time it entered my blood... it had been strained and As a result, I have immunity. It's only a guess, You don't think that It's a simple matter to find What will you do if I am infected? Cure me? You don't have to answer. I know as well as you do... it's incurable. There might be a way. If not of killing the germ, at least of If I had the equipment, the time. Which you don't. You are one of them. I was. And without that What do you mean? - You found a solution? Exactly as you said it could be. I take that for it. What is it? Defibrinated blood, plus vaccine. The blood feeds the germ... the vaccine keeps it isolated... and prevents it from multiplying. We've had it for some time now. We? We? There are quite a number of us. And I thought you were alone. I was going to cure you. - Does that amuse you? Now, I want the truth. I want all of it. Why are you here? To find out if you know You know far less. We're alive. Infected, yes. We're going to reorganize society. Do away with all those wretched creatures Start everything all over again. And you want me to join? You can't join us. You're a monster to them. Why do you think I Even though I was Because I was so terrified You're a legend in the city. Leaving, as evidence of your Many of the people you Many of them were loved ones I didn't know. Is there any way you What do you mean? They're coming after you tonight. That's why I was sent here. I'm supposed to keep - To kill me? Your new society sounds charming. The beginning of any society And you pretended to be Well, what are you waiting for? Why don't you go on and use it? Get it over with! Now you know. What are you going to do? - What are you doing? What? Look. Look! You see? It worked, Ruth. The antibodies in my blood worked. My blood has saved you, Ruth. Do you know what this means? We won't be alone. You are sure? Wait. Don't be afraid. - Where are you going? - and tell them you're not a threat to us. You can save all of us. When they for questions and answers. For God's sake, Robert, let me go. Ruth, look. Tomorrow. Please. Robert. Tomorrow, Ruth. Robert, no. - Robert. - What if this doesn't last? I've already checked it Wait, I'll show you. I'll prove it to you. Ruth, just take a look at this. This'll prove it to you. Ruth, there's no change. - Robert! - Ruth! Ruth! Get away from her. Ruth, are you all right? Are you all right? Run, Robert! Robert, run! Run! They've come Run! Run! Up there! There he is. Wait, you don't understand. Wait! Get him! Get him! Wait! Surround the block. Move! Move! This way. Hey, over here. This way. Cover all sides! Stand back. There he is! In the church! Over there! Hold your fire! Freaks! All of you. All of you, freaks. Mutations. Hold it. You're freaks. I am a man. The last man. Robert! They were afraid of me. They were afraid of me. They were afraid of me. They didn't know. Don't cry. We're all safe now. All safe.
