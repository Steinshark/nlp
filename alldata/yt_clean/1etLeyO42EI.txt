[Narrator] neuroscientist Jason Braithwaite and cultural anthropologist Deborah Hyde want to investigate the haunting Muncaster Castle near Ravenglass Are there really ghosts around? Chasing the undead - [Dr Jason Braithwaite] Muncaster Castle DR JASON BRAITHWAITE My personal sceptical belief is to keep the locals off the estate because nobody wants to go near the place And so it works as a kind of security However, I have spoken that claim to have had strange experiences that require perhaps a clearer eye cast and get to grips with them [Narrator] Peter Frost-Pennington As have some 30 generations of Penningtons And they ask themselves: Are we really alone [Peter Frost-Pennington] My wife and I in the room above when we were in bed... PETER FROST-PENNINGTON ...and we knew no one else And we heard &quot;tick tick tick tick...&quot; Strange things happen here. But I have talked to many people who have had strange things Some people have been really quite scared. So that is why I think it is haunted. [Narrator] Overnight guests have heard a child [Crying noises] [Narrator] Or: steps. And sometimes the door handle turns or the door jumps open. Then there are reports of apparitions, icy cold or the feeling of being watched. Peter Frost-Pennington He knows which ghost is haunting the room. Not far from the castle, in this chapel there is a reference a baptismal font with the name [Peter Frost-Pennington] the fourth Lord of Muncaster so Margaret was his only child. She inherited the castle of what we were told were screaming fits. It's such a sad story. who we think can still be sometimes met Not all the time, but occasionally [Narrator] In the Tapestry Room - [Crying sounds] Crying children DEBORAH HYDE In ghost stories in a lot of folklore actually, people seem to be okay with the idea But you get an awful lot of folklore So a crying baby doesn't surprise me. That would be unfinished business, [Narrator] The Penningtons have inhabited Peter himself married into the family. What I find fascinating about Muncaster... PETER FROST-PENNINGTON ...is we have that tradition of stories being passed down and you think, well they're just stories. not just the ghost stories but when we do research you find and quite sometimes [Narrator] One of these stories is about As a ghost, he is said to still roam DEBORAH HYDE Tom Skelton is an interesting ghost. because the family have really taken him They interpret things in the light They like to feel I think that he's really that he cares about them, In real life, there were rumours that Tom Skelton As a ghost here he seems to be a kind or trick people who he doesn't know - [Narrator] Legend has it that in the 16th century the court jester If travellers came by he allegedly sent them into the quicksand [Narrator] They also say the ghost Legend has it that the maid near the castle about 200 years ago. The white lady is a very common motif... DEBORAH HYDE ...in a lot of English And it's usually associated who are cut off in their prime. They're wrongfully murdered, they're killed some justice that they need [Narrator] Motorists report the &quot;white outside Muncaster Castle. We have accounts from eyewitnesses this apparent spectre or ghost dating from the late 1980s I've interviewed these people about what they saw, what happened So they are very clear in their minds There's always a twist because whilst the driver may well the passenger didn't. [Narrator] According to surveys, believe in ghosts than in God. DEBORAH HYDE As far as we can tell belief in ghosts Most religious systems and most countries have ghost stories, In England I think because we're surrounded by artefacts places you can walk into. We have castles and Stonehenge [Narrator] Muncaster Castle also has Are these ghosts in the end that the Penningtons pass on I originally came to Muncaster Castle DR JASON BRAITHWAITE ...in a lot of the local stories But what really interested me was that had been here and experience things. They were really reporting to me They were not experiencing that were in the legends, They were experiencing something And I thought as a scientist I would try to look at that a little more. [Narrator] Jason Braithwaite His research always focuses Eyewitness reports are So while people can be reporting that they experienced, It gives you a fascinating window into the nature But just because you may does not mean that ghosts are real. There could be more rational and I would suggest there are. [Narrator] Together with Deborah Hyde, Jason Braithwaite wants to take For many years he has examined The neuroscientist is looking for the &quot;ghostly apparitions&quot;. We have in one area highlighted It's what we call it. Whether or not it has to actually induce strange experiences we have yet to actually physically test But it may or may not be a coincidence that this magnetic anomaly - exists in exactly the room where many occupants have been very striking strange experiences. We've yet to explore whether [Narrator] The Tapestry Room - is said to be the spookiest room The Tapestry Room in the legends, There are lots of factors It could be simply that the room passing through it. And it does. So they are around more to be there and to hear [Narrator] The furnishings in the room [Dr Jason Braithwaite] And here in the fireplace, there are some devils' heads. It's very gothic and suggestive. And although it's very subtle, when you are in this environment you are not used to being in a castle, these sorts of things are just working slowly influencing [Deborah Hyde] because I kind of clocked them but I hadn't seen the detail. I haven't spotted that and I suppose a lot of that stuff [Eerie noises] [Narrator] This also explains that they are being observed in this room. We have found that people DR JASON BRAITHWAITE ...that have more portraits because Now the individuals may not necessarily but they can feel unnerved and have in rooms that have prominent portraits. [Narrator] But where do the eerie noises like the sound of a crying child? [Crying noises] Bear in mind that around here DEBORAH HYDE We're in the countryside. Foxes make horrible crying sounds. And if you believed in a ghost [Eerie noises] [Narrator] Even for the cold in the room Now there are some psychological reasons For example, the rooms are often painted That can make you feel a bit chilly. [Narrator] why the door opens at night The reality is, this door never It would only ever just wedge like that It was hung in a non-straight manner. And what would also happen on certain days it would pull the air through and thus, because the door was never secured the door would open like that. We actually witnessed this If you were asleep in the bed over there and you saw the door open, you would assume Exactly. And some people have described two or three times in the evening - Well it would do if the weather conditions [Narrator] Jason Braithwaite also has for why the door handle turns. [Dr Jason Braithwaite] What we have found at certain times of the year there's all these old and worn What can happen is, as you come it can stick and stay there under tension. When you then come to re-grab it, and it springs in your hand. [Deborah Hyde] We've seen it happen many times. [Narrator] Deborah Hyde has stayed What was it like for someone to stay in the spookiest room It was fine. It was absolutely fine. The only thing is that even if you don't believe in ghosts if you have to wander around by yourself at night your mind goes. It's just biological. It's just normal. So I had to pop down to use That was uncomfortable. [Narrator] Because there are corridors as we know them from horror movies. There's some evidence to suggest DEBORAH HYDE ...that you're in promotes or suppresses So if you're in a long, thin corridor whereas if you're in a room you can and there is more place to move. So there may be a psychological reason a little bit more in these narrow spaces. [Narrator] Both &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; agree. There are no real ghosts People know that it has history. You're surrounded by stone There are a lot of cues Absolutely. In some of the rooms That's why in locations like this, you only get experiences clustering It's because that's where all these things just come together and the predisposition Dr Braithwaite keeps coming and saying, PETER FROST-PENNINGTON ...no ghosts, it's all science.&quot; But he's been coming here and the ghosts are still having fun [Laughing sounds] [Narrator] Our next venue: The Creswell Crags on the border and Derbyshire in England. The limestone gorge The historian Professor Ronald Hutton According to popular belief, the &quot;Robin Hood Cave&quot; The expert for &quot;magic and witchcraft&quot; wants to unravel the numerous secret signs The discovery of the so-called witch marks PROF RONALD HUTTON ...is one of the most spectacular for magic ever made. To put it simply, we usually find these Here there are hundreds and hundreds. This makes Creswell Crags of ritual protection marks on the planet. [Narrator] A sensational discovery, because even though the signs their meaning has so far remained hidden. Ronald Hutton believes We're only just starting to understand but overwhelmingly they seem to appear And then when the Reformation comes the marks move from the churches around them like caves. So overwhelmingly they are from the period from around 1530 to 1900. [Narrator] Ronald Hutton can interpret What's behind the double V and the M? They took giving protection and transferred them The conjoint Vs are &quot;Virgo Virginum&quot; the virgin of virgins. And the M is Maria. [Narrator] The letters &quot;PM&quot; could also And it stands the maiden Mary, the Virgin Mary, One of the great figures And the letters put her protection even though the people will probably long have forgotten that they had anything to do [Narrator] The so-called &quot;witch signs&quot; to ward off misfortune and evil For example as protection bad harvests or diseases. When you live in a world that doesn't have PROF RONALD HUTTON ...and has so little knowledge and also as a world on the brink that a single act like a fire They like to feel that they have So the idea that you can actually that keeps at least more bad luck away That's why certain marks were regarded [Eerie noises] [Narrator] In addition to the signs, certain objects animals, too! Likewise, dead cats are often found so that evil spirits will find the cats, looking for them and run away as a mouse or a rat Shoes are very common. Perhaps because it was thought who very often seem to be regarded would get into the shoe or the boot [Narrator] In the Robin Hood Cave as well as carvings in the shape of boxes. We think that the meaning is that they were traps for evil spirits. Literally they would try to conjure and leave them trapped [Narrator] The largest collection in the darkest part of the cave. It appears as the gateway Professor Ronald Hutton can imagine why there are so many markings One is that this is and so the marks are put there and not allow it to get out The other possibility is from the outside world and driven where they're surrounded by the marks So this is a spirit prison or a sin bin. [Wind chimes] [Eerie noises] [Narrator] A former Benedictine monastery Here Daniel Nosler is hunting The archeologist knows the burial rites Here of all places, in consecrated ground, he believes to have found indications Many centuries ago, Some graves have strange features. So are there any &quot;undead&quot; buried here? Always and everywhere Especially in the Middle Ages the belief in the undead was very present. There are many archaeological findings DANIEL NOSLER Our interpretation is that especially people strongly believed in the undead [Narrator] when he archives old excavation photos. They show skeletons from the Middle Ages - found in the 80s during an excavation On one photo Daniel Nosler [Daniel Nosler] I noticed that there was over the head of a dead man, which could not have got there by chance, because the ground all around I also noticed which indicates that the stone was placed [Narrator] The deceased is a man, about 20 years old. At over 1.70 meters, The dead man, as he lies That means he was certainly At that time one could buy burial places However, there seems to have been among the descendants [Narrator] the dead man inside his grave [Eerie noises] [Narrator] Daniel Nosler believes: The people at that time thought A corpse that leaves its grave The archeologist researches who seem to have been weighted down At the place of execution &quot;Untenaus&quot; numerous victims of executions were probably kept in the grave A stone in the mouth, however, the &quot;after-devourers&quot;. A corpse that does not even have to leave The after-devourer sucks or &quot;devours&quot; burial gown or even his own flesh. In this way he withdraws the life force According to popular belief, That's why they tried to put things put things in their mouth It was also a matter of stopping them We have several cases here in Dramburg, in Pomerania, where the iron sickle was placed in order to prevent this after-feeding and on the other hand to prevent them Here's another example where they just Possibly it was put in the mouth [Narrator] Other measures also point In the 18th century, for example, the members of the noble family were tied up in their coffins The dead were staked with big iron nails, DANIEL NOSLER ...heads were chopped off, People were turned on their stomachs would be directed and not towards the world of the living. There are numerous ways to detect this. [Narrator] Daniel Nosler assumes was banished in his grave The dead man was buried probably in the 14th century. That is when these terrible epidemics, the Black Death, the plague, We assume this young man died and in these times of hysteria, people tried to keep him in his grave [Narrator] If someone succumbs to it, family members, friends, acquaintances. Daniel Nosler meets his colleague He was present at the excavation The stone, it's a stroke of luck and wasn't shovelled away, because people thought At the time we thought nothing of it. [Eerie noises] [Narrator] Daniel Nosler reopens the case The archaeology of the undead is actually a very, very young discipline. In the past, one was certainly smiled at DANIEL NOSLER Today, science has become In addition to this, we have a whole range from folklore and history [Narrator] Written and pictorial sources also refer to the belief in the undead that are no longer verifiable Holy water, prayers or spells. Through my research I have discovered an incredible variety of undead people. It is almost impossible to quantify them. There is countless countless evidence in written sources, This actually means has been present everywhere. Not only in Germany, [Eerie noises] [Narrator] Depending on the region, the ideas of the undead The &quot;Headless Horseman&quot; is a revenant also in Germany - It was believed at the time that suicides or criminals could become headless horsemen. According to legend, the mounted undead Sometimes he only frightens his victim, but in the worst case he robs him The &quot;piggy-backer&quot; usually an undead, who jumps on the back Sometimes until the living person or from exhaustion. [Eerie noises] [Narrator] But who became &quot;undead&quot; anyway? Murderers, perjurers, DANIEL NOSLER ...were suspected of becoming undead Someone who died far from home, So, there were a variety of possibilities. And very importantly, if the burial rite people suspected the person and wouldn't rest in peace. [Narrator] unusual burial at Harsefeld Monastery. To our surprise the corpse was lying on his stomach face down... DIETRICH ALSDORF ...and his lower legs were close together, so we could assume that he was tied up All the others were buried on their backs [Narrator] [Dietrich Alsdorf] Here's the chest, which is sloping. Back when we exposed it, we thought, &quot;Okay, this is somebody who somehow in a fight and the opponents Which was quite common back then. [Narrator] But Daniel Nosler believes that the man There's evidence to support that. The lower legs and the skull is also destroyed. In other words, so that the dead man was no longer able And the chest was destroyed. Perhaps the heart was removed to destroy [Narrator] Did the monks really allow Daniel Nosler is convinced of this even at the altar, the &quot;holiest&quot; place he found an indication Excavations were carried out here DANIEL NOSLER and skeletons of abbots buried here The exciting thing was: an abbot had been fastened at his feet [Narrator] Was this how they tried The lock still exists. Also an iron bell. [Daniel Nosler] This little bell was found who was discovered in the cloister. This leads us to suspect that maybe when someone moved in his grave. [Narrator] The dead in Harsefeld Monastery Which conclusions can the archeologist What is interesting about these findings: Harsefeld monastery was one DANIEL NOSLER ...here in the north. It was under the direct control If such superstitious acts it must have been done with the approval This means that in the case was not that strong and they preferred [Eerie noises] [Narrator] Change of venue: Romania. Historian Peter Mario Kreuter He has specialised in the south-eastern and has been researching this for years. The most famous of all the undead The vampire. Basically, it must be said DR PETER MARIO KREUTER ...or whatever you call it, But what characterizes it from many other forms of revenants is the fact that the ghost He is a damaging, There is nothing positive about him. [Narrator] The vampire a la Dracula, as we know him is an exaggerated version of the vampire Occasionally a vampire will drink blood, but it never sucks it. There is no such thing as sharp teeth Furthermore, its harmful activity It can also spoil the harvest, or drive the cattle crazy. Sometimes it is even claimed right inside the body of the cow. [Narrator] the life energy from his victims He's an individual dead man returning. He's no stranger. It's always someone A second important point: He is harmful just because he exists, because he should not be [Narrator] That is why people even in the 21st century. In 2004, a case in the Wallachian village when a man died there, The dead man is thought to be Villagers open the grave, and prepare a healing potion Not only did Those who participated in the excavation for disturbing the peace of the dead. This is not something tolerate in any way. If they find out about it. [Narrator] Do people in Little Wallachia Kreuter asks inhabitants 80-year-old Stela Barbu lives there. She is a corpse washer. Together with her daughter-in-law Florica Taking down DR PETER MARIO KREUTER ...is a classic that is found which has made it into vampire literature, where the mirror shows The missing mirror image [Narrator] Stela and Florica Barbu to bid farewell to the deceased [Dr Peter Mario Kreuter] but he has not yet left the community. That has to be done in a proper way. It's the common practice to bid farewell, to make the transition If it goes wrong, other preventive measures will be taken. Not those against a bad crossing, [Narrator] to fight the poltergeist, the vampire? -They exist. Yes, some stab him STELA BARBU And a woman was dug up here They went up to her, dug her up That's what we heard. Well... [Narrator] The belief in vampires - Already in the 18th century, At that time a certain Arnold Paole is said to be up to mischief 1732 the military doctor Johann Fluckinger by order of the imperial governor. [Wood creaking] [Raven cry] [Narrator] Allegedly the body showed We must not forget DR PETER MARIO KREUTER ...to understand decay in corpses in the 19th century, [Narrator] And so even Fluckinger cannot His report spreads throughout Europe. The most interesting thing is that in several instances this is a very old belief. People have always done these things. He writes about another story of a case So, this Mr Fluckinger the very first folkloristic material [Narrator] More than 20 years later commissioned her personal physician Gerard van Swieten names natural causes such as lack of air for the alleged vampire characteristics He is not the only scholar for the apparently good condition In 1755, among other things, But even this does not really eradicate Of course, DR PETER MARIO KREUTER ...crazy, superstitious stuff but nobody really fought the belief After all, it was essentially where the Enlightenment ruled, A somewhat different world [Narrator] In the village of Moldoveni, Peter Mario Kreuter wants to know whether the corpse washer believes in the so-called poltergeists. I don't think they exist. STELA BARBU Although, there was a girl's father The girl got sick The girl didn't recover to stab something into his belly button. But you don't believe such a thing exists? No. I don't know. We don't know. May God protect us from this. [Narrator] Her daughter-in-law claims to have experienced it herself. With her late brother-in-law. We saw a teardrop on the side of his eye. My sister did not know he was a ghost. FLORICA BARBU After we took him home, I remember that. What is it? What is it? After that we went to someone and he said, &quot;Yes, we absolutely have to impale him&quot;. And he stabbed him, around midnight. Nobody knew about it, only he he stabbed him and immediately afterwards That's what's really important DR PETER MARIO KREUTER People only intervene if there is actually something indicating Dead bodies are not simply just to be on the safe side. Nor do people live in fear of a ghost No, if something is wrong, And that's all there is to it. [Narrator] Even such spindles are said When the dead man is buried, are placed in the coffin In this case, I assume, because they are pointed, so that if the vampire does move, and thereby prevented [Narrator] Peter Mario Kreuter's The belief in the undead still seems to be Kreuter wants to know more Ochia Tudose also works and knows what to do in an emergency. What do you do with a ghost? So, I go there and I stab it After an hour or two I go there, I stab straight into the navel, OCHIA TUDOSE But it's even better to stab the heart. The heart controls the whole body This vampire-thing is very, If you do not pierce him, [Narrator] as to which child could later become [Ochia Tudose] If the mother gives birth and people do not pay attention the child will eat it. [Old woman] A neighbour said to us, &quot;you have to stab me when I die because MILICA TUDOSE My mother gave birth to me [Narrator] The couple tells him how an undead If no one punctures him the poltergeist comes home He rumbles about. He brawls around the house. When a man and his family drove the oxen pulling the cart Because an undead appeared. He made noises, moaned and squeaked. [Dr Peter Mario Kreuter] [Ochia Tudose] You couldn't see a thing. The poltergeist, it can also drive the animals crazy it can for example spoil the harvest. As I said, it can also break the dishes, I'm gathering very interesting All these elements are really very nice [Priest chanting| [Narrator] How does the church deal in vampires and the undead? The vampire researcher meets the priest and wants to know what he thinks about it. The church is prepared for everything. NITA FLORICA For unclean souls we have special prayers We have the right medicine For example, we have a prayer for souls who cannot leave their bodies. When the exit of the soul is difficult For him, too, DR PETER MARIO KREUTER to leave this world to pass Even if he uses prayers and the rituals [Narrator] So Peter Mario Kreuter in his search for the undead. Here in Romania, the belief in the ghosts and it's deeply rooted in the customs This belief still plays an important role
