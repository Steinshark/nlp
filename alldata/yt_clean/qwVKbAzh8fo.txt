- [Narrator] It's no secret. Venice has a flooding problem. (somber music) Here's St. Mark Square, it's - It used to be flooded - [Narrator] Now, it But Venice also gets larger floods that can cover this much of the city. - [Giovanni] In the past, this was a very exceptional case. - [Narrator] But since 2000, In 2019, a catastrophic flood So we brought in engineer Giovanni Cecconi to discuss how Venice before it drowns. (somber music continues) These are the MOSE barriers design and operate. - (Giovanni speaks foreign language) - [Narrator] They're that rise to separate the It's the city's $6 billion - This is the Venice Lagoon with the three entrances: - [Narrator] Two times a and fills the lagoon with water. The low tide then flushes To block high tides, the MOSE barriers were - This is the bottom of the canal in which the barrier are installed, and inside there is the flood gate. - Each gate is 66 feet and 61 to 97 feet tall, more than half the size of So if forecast show especially high tides, the city raises the gates, - The air is pumped But because of the hinges, it will assume 50 degree position, keeping the sea higher and - [Narrator] Once raised, the barriers can maintain from the sea to the And for now, it's working. In 2022, a 5.5 foot tide was which could have flooded Because of the barriers, only had to face wind and rain. But when the 78 MOSE they don't just keep water out, they also keep what's in the lagoon in. That's an issue because some of Venice's sewage flows into the lagoon and requires the tide to wash it out. And that's not the only problem. - In 50-60 year, if more than two feet, the - [Narrator] This increase in sea level has led to more high tides, which has led the city to raise the gates far more often than originally planned, 66 times so far. But the sea level isn't just rising. Venice is also sinking. - Over the last century, the The sea level rose 4.3 inches. - [Narrator] Starting in the from underground to support compacting the earth and Though the city has stopped pumping, Venice is still sinking at a rate of one to two millimeters per year. So some scientists have a proposal, lift the city back up by - Below Venice, we have different strata of clay and sandy soil. Sand is made of solid and water, and this water has a certain pressure. If you increase the pressure, the grain will increase in volume. And so you are very bound. - [Narrator] Scientists estimate that this could push Venice And this idea has been implemented before. - [Giovanni] Here we are - [Narrator] Starting in the 1940s, water and oil were pumped out sinking the city and - And here, there has injecting the water back into the wells. - [Narrator] But Venice and Long Beach aren't quite the same. Giovanni says Venice has a different type of soil than Long Beach and if Venice implemented this technique, it might not be as successful. - [Giovanni] If we pump water below ground and this produce an uneven you can figure out what will happen. - [Narrator] The centuries old buildings and bridges could crumble. - And this has to be maintained forever. - [Narrator] Because if the - [Giovanni] This elevation that we gain will be lost as a souffle that was abandoned out of the oven. - [Narrator] But there's a much larger one, a super levee. - [Giovanni] The super inside this red line. - [Narrator] Ordinary meant to block flood waters, but significant flooding or seep through, breaking the levee and cascading into the Super levees solve this problem by creating a flood protection zone. They have a wide footprint In Venice, it would be about 13 feet tall and extend almost 400 feet along the base. It makes them resistant to And even if water reached the top, it would flow slowly down the slope instead of cascading down, like it would with a standard levee. In Venice, a super levee forming a lake inside the boundary. - There will be a the flushing of the city, so the water will enter continuously, and we can produce electricity here. - [Narrator] Pumps would - This will allow the the water to circulate inside the so we can swim again in the city. - [Narrator] And on to build infrastructure. - Garage, transportation, - [Narrator] And lastly. - We can relocate the tourism from the historical - [Narrator] Currently, for tourists than it has citizens. Giovanni believes a super the battle for space and in the city. But this plan faces a hurdle. Construction of the MOSE with corruption and delays. Building a super levee by becomes ineffective would and the public's approval. - What we can learn from the past is, we need direct So there will be not but the super levee of - [Narrator] In the meantime, to adapt to the rising tides. Glass barriers protect ancient monuments from the salt water, raised and Venetians wear waiters. - The history of Venice of adaptation in which by trial and error. I am optimistic because there in the future.
