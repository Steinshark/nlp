I'M GETTING OLDER. I USED TO GO TO MEXICO TO PARTY. NOW I GOT THERE FOR THE MEDICINE. ALL MY FRIENDS HAVE WRISTBANDS FROM THE CLUB, I HAVE ONE FROM THE CLINIC. WHEN WE WERE COMING FROM MEXICO, THEY STOPPED OUR CARS. WE WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED AGAIN. AND BORDER PATROL WAS SEARCHING OUR CARS, 'CAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT NO DRUGS TO GET INTO AMERICA, RIGHT? THAT'S GOOD. WHEN WE'RE GOING TO MEXICO, MEXICAN BORDER THEY WERE SEARCHING OUR CAR 'CAUSE THEY DIDN'T LIKE WHAT? PROGRESS? &quot;WHAT IS THAT, CLEAN WATER? GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE!
