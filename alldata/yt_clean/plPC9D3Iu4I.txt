&gt;&gt; NO, I'M NOT CRAZY. &gt;&gt; I AM TOTALLY WIGGED OUT. &gt;&gt; Narrator: THESE TWO OBSESSED COLLECTORS WILL IMMERSE YOU IN A WORLD WHERE FINDING THE ONE-OF-A-KIND ITEM IS EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; BUT I DO HAVE AN OBSESSION WITH MICKEY MOUSE. I WANT TO FIND THEM! &gt;&gt; Narrator: THEY TRAVEL THE COUNTRY, TRYING TO ACQUIRE THE SMALLEST, LARGEST... &gt;&gt; TA-DA! &gt;&gt; Narrator: ...OR STRANGEST OBJECTS. NOTHING GETS IN THE WAY OF THEIR PASSION. &gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE THIS. I DON'T HAVE THIS. I DON'T HAVE THIS. &gt;&gt; WHOO! &gt;&gt; Narrator: THERE ISN'T ANY RULE THEY WON'T BREAK... &gt;&gt; IT BREAKS THE CODE. &gt;&gt; Narrator: ...OR LINE THEY WON'T CROSS... &gt;&gt; LOVE THE HAIR. &gt;&gt; Narrator: ...OR PLAN THEY WILL NOT ENTERTAIN... &gt;&gt; UNH-UNH. &gt;&gt; Narrator: ...TO OBTAIN THEIR MOST PRIZED POSSESSION. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; Narrator: THIS IS &quot;MY CRAZY OBSESSION.&quot; &gt;&gt; I DO THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT WEIRD. &gt;&gt; Narrator: MICKEY MOUSE IS ONE OF THE MOST BELOVED CHARACTERS OF ALL TIME. HIS LIKENESS IS FEATURED ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND WHILE MANY EVENTUALLY OUTGROW THEIR LOVE OF MICKEY, NOT 55-YEAR-OLD JANET ESTEVEZ. SHE STILL HAS A HOUSE FULL OF MOUSE. &gt;&gt; I HAVE OVER 5,000 -- MAYBE CLOSER TO 6,000 -- PIECES RIGHT NOW -- KEY CHAINS, WATCHES, CLOCKS, SNOW GLOBES. NAME IT, I HAVE IT. [ CHUCKLES ] EVERYTHING I NEED TO LEARN IN LIFE, I LEARN FROM MICKEY MOUSE. HE'S GENTLE. HE'S KIND. HE'S SMART. HE'S EVERYTHING YOU WANT IN A PERFECT PERSON. I'M NOT CRAZY, BUT I DO HAVE AN OBSESSION WITH MICKEY MOUSE. I HAVE TO ADMIT IT. &gt;&gt; Narrator: JANET ESTEVEZ IS SO OBSESSED WITH MICKEY MOUSE THAT, SINCE 1974, WHEN SHE FIRST STARTED TO COLLECT, SHE HAS NOT THROWN OUT A SINGLE PIECE OF PAPER THAT HAS HIS IMAGE ON IT. &gt;&gt; IT'S TAKEN ME OVER 30 YEARS TO HAVE THIS COLLECTION. &gt;&gt; Narrator: JANET CURRENTLY HOLDS THE GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS FOR MOST MICKEY MOUSE ITEMS AND, SINCE 2007, HAS BROKEN HER OWN RECORD TWICE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOT SUCH A THING AS TOO MANY MICKEYS IN HER MIND, SO THE QUEST FOR NEW MICKEYS CONTINUES TO THIS DAY. &gt;&gt; Narrator: AND TO KEEP UP THAT PURCHASING PACE, JANET SHOPS AT FLEA MARKETS, GARAGE SALES, AND LARGE RETAIL STORES FOR NEW MICKEY ITEMS EVERY SINGLE DAY. &gt;&gt; I NEED IT, I NEED IT, I NEED IT, AND IT'S MY SIZE. CUTE! &gt;&gt; Narrator: SHE CAN SPEND UP TO $200 IN ONE TRIP JUST BUYING MASS-PRODUCED SOUVENIRS, BUT IT IS REALLY THE RARE, SOMETIMES PRICELESS, MUST-HAVE ITEMS SHE'S SEARCHING FOR ON THESE DAILY MOUSE HUNTS. &gt;&gt; THIS I NEED. I'LL HAVE TO TALK TO SOMEBODY TO SEE IF I CAN GET THAT DISPLAY. &gt;&gt; Narrator: AND SHE WILL GO TO ANY LENGTH TO ACQUIRE THESE ONE-OF-A-KIND AND OFTEN NOT-FOR-SALE MICKEYS. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU DO WITH THE DISPLAYS, THE MICKEY DISPLAYS... &gt;&gt; NO. UNFORTUNATELY, WE DON'T GIVE AWAY OUR SIGNS. I'M SORRY. &gt;&gt; [ Voice breaking ] DON'T TELL ME THAT. WHERE DO YOU PUT THEM? I WANT TO FIND THEM. I WANT TO FIND THEM WHEN YOU THROW THEM AWAY. YOU CAN'T THROW AWAY MICKEY. &gt;&gt; IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD. EVERYBODY HAS THEIR CERTAIN OBSESSIONS, SO MICKEY JUST HAPPENS TO BE HERS. &gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT ACQUIRING MICKEY MEMORABILIA IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF HER OBSESSION. THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY VISITS DISNEY WORLD ONLY ONCE IN THEIR LIFETIME. JANET HAS ALREADY BEEN THERE 200 TIMES AND NOW VISITS THE MICKEY MOUSE THEATER THREE TIMES A WEEK, EVERY SINGLE WEEK. &gt;&gt; I ALWAYS TELL HIM THAT, &quot;SOMEDAY YOU HAVE TO COME AND VISIT MY COLLECTION, MY HOUSE.&quot; AND HE ALWAYS GOES, &quot;YEAH.&quot; HE GOES, &quot;CALL ME.&quot; [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; I THINK MY MOM WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT MICKEY REMEMBERS HER. &gt;&gt; OF COURSE, I KNOW THAT MICKEY REMEMBERS ME. OF COURSE HE REMEMBERS ME. &gt;&gt; Narrator: MICKEY MAKES SIX APPEARANCES DAILY, AND WHEN SHE'S THERE, SHE TRIES TO SEE HIM AT EVERY SINGLE ONE. &gt;&gt; SHE JUST GETS SO HAPPY. IT'S LIKE HER INNER CHILD JUST GLOWS. &gt;&gt; I GO TO THE PARKS, AND MINNIE IS WITH HIM. I HAVE TO SAY HELLO TO HER, AND IT'S OKAY, BUT THEN I SAY, &quot;I NEED SOME TIME ALONE WITH HIM,&quot; AND SHE STEPS OUT, AND I CAN HUG HIM AND KISS HIM. &gt;&gt; SHE DOESN'T ADMIT IT, BUT I THINK SHE'S A LITTLE JEALOUS OF MINNIE. &gt;&gt; MICKEY IS MY MOUSE FRIEND, AND I'M HIS GIRLFRIEND. BUT I HAVE A HUSBAND. SO, YOU DO THE MATH. &gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT IT WAS JANET'S HUSBAND WHO FANNED THE FLAMES OF HER MOUSE PASSION. IN 1974, THE TWO GOT MARRIED, AND FOR THEIR HONEYMOON, RICKY TOOK JANET TO DISNEY WORLD FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. FOR JANET, IT WAS SECOND LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT WAS VERY, VERY -- A BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE. &gt;&gt; JANET STARTED COLLECTING WHEN WE GOT MARRIED. AND I PROMISED HER THAT WE WOULD BE COMING TO DISNEY AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR. I HAVE SINCE KEPT MY PROMISE. &gt;&gt; AFTER SPENDING THOUSANDS ON AIRFARE AND FOUR TO EIGHT DAYS TRAVELING FROM THEIR HOME IN PUERTO RICO FOR THEIR YEARLY PILGRIMAGE TO ORLANDO... &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO DRIVE TO SAN JUAN, TAKE AN AIRPLANE TO MIAMI, THEN ANOTHER PLANE TO ORLANDO. YES, IT WAS A WHOLE-DAY AFFAIR. &gt;&gt; Narrator: ...RICKY CONTEMPLATED BREAKING HIS PROMISE. BUT AT JANET'S INSISTENCE, THEY MOVED CLOSER, TO STUART, FLORIDA, ONLY TWO HOURS FROM HER OTHER TRUE LOVE'S HOME. &gt;&gt; WELL, IT WAS CLOSE ENOUGH. I MEAN, IT WAS AN IMPROVEMENT FROM [Laughing] 1,135 MILES. [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT TRAVELING TWICE A WEEK FOR FOUR HOURS TO SEE HER MOUSE WAS STILL TOO MUCH FOR JANET TO BEAR, SO THEY MOVED AGAIN, THIS TIME INTO A CONDO IN CELEBRATION, FLORIDA, THAT PUTS HER JUST 10 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE MAGIC KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; NOW I'M ONLY 7 MILES FROM DISNEY WORLD. &gt;&gt; Narrator: COMING UP... &gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE MICKEYS IN THE BATHROOM, WE DON'T HAVE MICKEYS IN OUR BEDROOM, WE DON'T HAVE MICKEYS IN MY OFFICE. WE KEEP OUR SPACES. &gt;&gt; Narrator: WITH RICKY'S MICKEY RULES, WILL JANET BE ABLE TO FIT ALL OF HER COLLECTION IN THEIR NEW, MUCH SMALLER CONDO? OR, AFTER 30 YEARS, WILL SOME OF HER COLLECTION HAVE TO GET THROWN OUT? &gt;&gt; UNH-UNH. UNH-UNH. NO WAY. &gt;&gt; Narrator: AND LATER, TAMIS BARON'S OBSESSION CATCHES PEOPLE OFF GUARD EVERY SINGLE DAY. &gt;&gt; IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT HOW TAMIS WILL LOOK ONE WEEK TO THE NEXT. &gt;&gt; Narrator: JANET ESTEVEZ HAS BEEN COLLECTING MICKEY MOUSE MEMORABILIA FOR THE PAST 30 YEARS, AND HER 5,000-PIECE COLLECTION IS THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD. SHE AND HER HUSBAND RECENTLY DOWNSIZED FROM A 3,000-SQUARE-FOOT HOME TO AN 1,800-SQUARE-FOOT CONDO IN CELEBRATION, FLORIDA, SO SHE WOULD ONLY BE 7 MILES FROM HER MOUSE FRIEND. &gt;&gt; IT'S AS CLOSE TO HEAVEN AS I'M GOING TO GET, THAT'S FOR SURE. &gt;&gt; Narrator: ALTHOUGH RICKY HIRED MOVERS... &gt;&gt; OH, MY GOSH. [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; Narrator: ...JANET REFUSED TO ALLOW THEM TO EVEN TOUCH HER MICKEY ITEMS, SO SHE MADE SEVERAL TWO-HOUR TRIPS TO FERRY HER MANY BOXES OF MICKEYS TO THEIR NEW HOME. &gt;&gt; I ALWAYS WANTED TO LIVE HERE. THAT'S WHY WE BOUGHT THIS PLACE. &gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT NOW, AS SHE MOVES IN, JANET ISN'T SURE IF SHE CAN FIT THE WHOLE COLLECTION INTO HER NEW HOME OR IF HER HUSBAND IS GOING TO MAKE HER DOWNSIZE HER COLLECTION, AS WELL. &gt;&gt; SINCE WE HAVE CONSTRAINED OUR COLLECTION TO A SMALLER AREA NOW, WE ARE HAVING A CHALLENGE IN FINDING SPACE FOR ALL THE MICKEY ITEMS. &gt;&gt; Narrator: IN HER PREVIOUS HOUSE, EVERY MOUSE HAD AN EXACT PLACE WHERE IT STAYED FOR YEARS WITHOUT BEING MOVED. BUT NOW, WITH LESS SPACE, FINDING THE PERFECT SPOT FOR EACH PIECE IS NO EASY TASK. &gt;&gt; EVERY SINGLE SPOT ON THIS WALL IS TAKEN. &gt;&gt; NOT YET. NOT YET. YOU CAN STILL SEE THE WALL. &gt;&gt; IN THEIR PREVIOUS HOUSE, WHERE SHE STARTED REALLY DISPLAYING HER COLLECTION, THERE WAS SOME IN THE LIVING ROOM, BUT NOT OVERLY TAKING OVER THE HOUSE. HERE THEY'RE JUST KIND OF EVERYWHERE. [ CHUCKLES ] &gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT TO JANET, THE PRECISE PLACEMENT OF HER 5,000-PIECE COLLECTION IS ANYTHING BUT HAPHAZARD. TO HER, IT IS AN EXACTING ART, AND SHE CAN SPEND AN HOUR JUST ORGANIZING HER MICE. &gt;&gt; I REARRANGE THEM, AND I LOOK AT THEM -- &quot;UH, NO...UH, NO.&quot; AND I MOVE THEM AND I MOVE THEM AND THEN I TALK TO THEM AND SAY, &quot;DO YOU LIKE IT HERE? NO, YOU DON'T LIKE IT. DO YOU LIVE HERE? NO, YOU DON'T LIVE HERE.&quot; &gt;&gt; IT'S PRETTY WEIRD THAT SHE TALKS TO THEM SOMETIMES AND BLOWS KISSES AT THEM, BUT I GUESS THAT'S -- A LOT OF PEOPLE DO THAT. &gt;&gt; Narrator: FOR HER LARGER AND MOST PRIZED PIECES, FINDING THE RIGHT SPOT CAN BE A WHOLE-DAY AFFAIR... &gt;&gt; NO, DON'T LIKE IT. &gt;&gt; Narrator: ...MADE MORE STRESSFUL BY HER HUSBAND'S STRINGENT MICKEY RULES. &gt;&gt; TA-DA! [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T FIT ANYWHERE ELSE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; MY HUSBAND HAS HIS OWN AREA, BUT THE REST OF THE HOUSE IS MICKEY HOUSE. SHE WANTED TO SEE IF IT FIT HERE, BUT -- &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T FIT HERE. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT THAT THERE ARE NO MICKEYS IN HIS OFFICE. I GOT TO FIND A PLACE FOR YOU, BABY. &gt;&gt; I REQUESTED THAT WE DON'T HAVE MICKEYS IN THE BATHROOM, WE DON'T HAVE MICKEYS IN OUR BEDROOM, WE DON'T HAVE MICKEYS IN MY OFFICE. WE KEEP OUR SPACES SEPARATE. &gt;&gt; THERE IS A HIDDEN MICKEY INSIDE THE OFFICE. HE DOESN'T KNOW IT. I HAVE TO HAVE A MICKEY EVERYWHERE. IT'S CALLED A HIDDEN MICKEY. &gt;&gt; Narrator: THERE'S ONE OTHER MICKEY IN JANET'S HOUSE THAT PEOPLE DON'T EVER GET TO SEE. &gt;&gt; I DO HAVE A SAD MICKEY. MY HUSBAND BOUGHT IT FOR ME BACK IN 1991, WHEN MY PARENTS PASSED AWAY. IT WAS A SAD PERIOD IN MY LIFE. [ Crying ] IT'S BEEN OVER 21 YEARS THAT MY PARENTS PASSED AWAY. I CRY EVERY DAY. THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO KEEP MYSELF HAPPY WITH HIM. SO I HAVE HAPPY MICKEY. &gt;&gt; Narrator: WITH HER SAD MICKEY SAFELY SECURED IN HER NEW HOME, JANET STILL HAS TO FIND PLACES FOR 4,999 SMILING MICE. &gt;&gt; IT IS BEAUTIFUL. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; HE CAN BE THERE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT HER HUSBAND HAS LIMITED HER CHOICES. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE AN UNSPOKEN CODE THAT MICKEY WILL BE CONSTRAINED TO CERTAIN AREAS OF THE HOUSE. &gt;&gt; Narrator: THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN JUST ONE EXCEPTION TO RICKY'S RULES OF NO MICKEY IN HIS OFFICE OR THEIR BEDROOM. FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS, JANET HAS SLEPT BETWEEN RICKY AND MICKEY ON A MICKEY PILLOWCASE. AND NOW HAVING MOVED INTO A SMALLER SPACE, JANET HAS TRIED TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. TA-DA! HIGHER. &gt;&gt; IT BREAKS THE CODE. &gt;&gt; IT BREAKS THE CODE. I KNOW. &gt;&gt; I HAVE A BETTER PLACE FOR IT, THOUGH. IT IS A RUG, AND THIS IS WHERE RUGS BELONG. YOU CAN USE IT AS A DOORMAT. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE KIDDING ME. NO WAY. NOBODY'S GONNA WIPE THEIR FEET ON MICKEY. UNH-UNH. UNH-UNH. MNH-MNH. NO WAY. &gt;&gt; I THINK WE SHOULD PUT IT THERE. &gt;&gt; NO. NO, NO, NO. NO, NO, NO. WE'LL FIND A... &gt;&gt; WE WORK OUT WHERE TO DISPLAY THE ITEMS SOMETIMES, AND SOMETIMES WE AGREE, SOMETIMES WE DON'T. WHATEVER MAKES JANET HAPPY IS FINE WITH ME. YOU KNOW HOW THEY SAY -- IT'S HAPPY WIFE, HAPPY LIFE. I LIKE MICKEY, TOO, AND WE EACH HAVE OUR PLACE IN JANET'S LIFE. &gt;&gt; JUST TO SEE HER KIND OF LIGHT UP LIKE THAT -- THAT'S REALLY NICE. IT MAKES HER HAPPY, AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. &gt;&gt; IF EVERYBODY WAS LIKE MICKEY MOUSE, WOULDN'T IT BE A BETTER WORLD? &gt;&gt; Narrator: NEXT, TAMIS BARON'S OBSESSION TAKES ON A DIFFERENT EXPRESSION WHENEVER THE MOOD STRIKES. &gt;&gt; I DO THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT WEIRD... &gt;&gt; HEY! &gt;&gt; ...BUT TO EACH THEIR OWN. &gt;&gt; Narrator: A SUPERMARKET ATTRACTS PEOPLE FROM ALL DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE -- A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSWOMAN, THE LOCAL LIBRARIAN, AND A FREE-SPIRIT ROCK-'N'-ROLLER. BUT TODAY THESE SHOPPERS ARE ALL THE SAME PERSON. &gt;&gt; MMM, IT'S VERY GOOD. I AM THE LADY WHO WEARS DIFFERENT WIGS. I AM THE WIG LADY. &gt;&gt; I DO THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT WEIRD, BUT TO EACH THEIR OWN. &gt;&gt; Narrator: OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS, TAMIS BARON HAS COLLECTED MORE THAN 2,000 WIGS. &gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY I THINK ABOUT WIGS A LOT, PROBABLY MOST OF THE TIME, BECAUSE IT'S JUST A PASSION OF MINE. WEARING A WIG IS LIKE TAKING A MASK OFF BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE BORN WITH, OUR EVERYDAY SELF, NOT NECESSARILY MATCHES WHO WE ARE ON THE INSIDE. SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY, &quot;YOU CHANGED YOUR HAIR.&quot; AND I SAY, &quot;EVERY FEW MINUTES.&quot; [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; Narrator: SHE HAS SO MANY WIGS THAT SHE'S DEDICATED AN ENTIRE ROOM IN HER HOME TO HOUSE THE COLLECTION AND CONTINUES TO ADD TO IT AT AN IMPRESSIVE RATE. &gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY I BUY A NEW ONE EVERY WEEK. I WANT ONE OF EVERY COLOR, OF EVERY STYLE. I HAVE EVERYTHING FROM THIS RED HAIR, BLOND, BRUNETTE, BLACK. I HAVE SPIKY, CURLY, SHORT. SOME ARE HANDMADE. SOME ARE MADE OF SYNTHETIC HAIR, HUMAN HAIR. SOME ARE BRAND NAMES. MY MOST UNUSUAL WIG IS MY MOHAWK. I CREATED THAT MYSELF. I LIKE TO NAME THEM AFTER MY FRIENDS. THIS ONE IS THE ADRIAN. EVERY HAIRSTYLE THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE, I PROBABLY HAVE IT. IF I DON'T, I WILL. &gt;&gt; Narrator: MOST OF TAMIS' 2,000 WIGS ARE MADE OUT OF REAL HAIR. WHILE A WIG MADE OUT OF SYNTHETIC MATERIAL CAN COST UPWARDS OF $100, A WIG MADE OF HUMAN HAIR COSTS BETWEEN $800 AND $3,000. &gt;&gt; THE MOST EXPENSIVE WIG I HAVE IS THIS ONE. I HAD THIS ONE CUSTOM-MADE. I HAD IT MEASURED TO FIT MY HEAD. I HAVE ACTUALLY NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT HOW MUCH I HAVE SPENT ON MY COLLECTION OF WIGS. I WOULD SAY CLOSE TO $100,000 OVER THE PAST YEARS. &gt;&gt; Narrator: TAMIS IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING THE STYLE OF EACH WIG IN HER COLLECTION. &gt;&gt; I SPEND A COUPLE HOURS A DAY WORKING ON WIGS. &gt;&gt; Narrator: SHE HAS BEEN A HAIRDRESSER SINCE 1980 BUT NOW PUTS HER STYLING SKILLS TO GOOD USE, OBSESSING OVER THE HAIRDO OF EACH AND EVERY WIG. &gt;&gt; IT TAKES ME ABOUT 3 HOURS TO DO THE DYE JOB, 40 MINUTES TO CUT IT, AND THEN, IF I'M GOING TO CURL IT WITH A CURLING IRON, PROBABLY ANOTHER HOUR 'CAUSE I'M PRETTY PICKY. I GOT STARTED COLLECTING WIGS AT ABOUT 8 YEARS OLD, WHEN MY AUNT ALICE WOULD GIVE ME ALL HER OLD WIGS. THEN, WHEN I WAS IN MY 20s, I WORKED AT A HAIR SALON. I WOULD CUT SOMEBODY'S HAIR IN A STYLE AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE IT AND I'D THINK, &quot;I WANT MY HAIR LIKE THAT.&quot; THE WIGS ARE SO MUCH EASIER. JUST PUT IT ON AND GO. [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; Narrator: TAMIS' WIGS DON'T JUST SIT ON THE SHELF. WHILE THE AVERAGE WOMAN CHANGES HER HAIRSTYLE OVER 100 TIMES THROUGH HER LIFE, IN THE LAST 20 YEARS, TAMIS HAS CHANGED HER WIGS OVER 20,000 TIMES, INCLUDING WHENEVER SHE LEAVES THE HOUSE. &gt;&gt; THE WIG COMES BEFORE THE CLOTHING AND THEN WHATEVER THAT IS AFTER THAT. IT'S PRETTY RARE THAT I GO OUT WITHOUT SOME KIND OF A HAIRPIECE OR WIG ON. I REALLY CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME. &gt;&gt; Narrator: SHE ALWAYS BRINGS THREE WIGS WITH HER WHEREVER SHE GOES SO THAT SHE CAN EASILY CHANGE HER HAIRSTYLE TO MATCH HER MOOD. &gt;&gt; I WANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE CHOICE IF I'M IN THAT MOOD. IF YOU PUT ON A WIG AND YOU PUT ON A DIFFERENT OUTFIT, THEN YOU ARE CREATING A CHARACTER. THAT'S WHY I WANT A WIG. HEY! &gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT IT'S NOT JUST A SOLITARY PASTIME. ONCE A MONTH, TAMIS' CLOSEST FRIENDS JOIN IN ON HER OBSESSION FOR A THEMED WIG PARTY. &gt;&gt; I JUST HAVE A GROUP OF FRIENDS THAT LIKE TO WEAR DIFFERENT WIGS. OH, YOU LOOK LOVELY. [ LAUGHTER ] &gt;&gt; I LOVE THIS. &gt;&gt; IT'S A TRANSFORMATION. &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK? &gt;&gt; LOVELY. &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL. &gt;&gt; I HAVE SHOWN THEM THE WAY OF THE WIG. &gt;&gt; Narrator: COMING UP, TAMIS PUTS ON THE ONE WIG SHE HOPES WILL TAKE HER RELATIONSHIP WITH HER BOYFRIEND TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL. &gt;&gt; OH, MY GOSH. WHAT IN THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE? &gt;&gt; Narrator: TAMIS BARON IS OBSESSED WITH WEARING WIGS, AND WITH OVER 2,000 TO CHOOSE FROM, THEY'RE AN INTEGRAL PART OF HER LIFE -- SO MUCH SO THAT TAMIS HAS NOT LEFT HOME WITHOUT WEARING ONE FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS. &gt;&gt; EVEN HANS, MY BOYFRIEND -- HE WOULD TELL YOU THAT I DON'T WEAR A WIG EVERY DAY, BUT I DO. HE JUST DOESN'T KNOW THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY A HAIRPIECE. THAT'S NOT MY HAIR. I CAN SHOW YOU. THIS UNSNAPS. &gt;&gt; Narrator: ONE THING THAT REMAINS A CONSTANT IN TAMIS' WIGGED-OUT WORLD IS HER RELATIONSHIP WITH HER BOYFRIEND, HANS, WHO SHE'S BEEN WITH FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS. &gt;&gt; SHE LIVES IN HER HOUSE, AND I LIVE IN MY HOUSE. &gt;&gt; I DON'T PLAY HOUSE. YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE GONNA LIVE WITH ME, YOU GOT TO BE MY HUSBAND. &gt;&gt; FOR NOW, I'M JUST PUTTING THAT ON THE BACK BURNER FOR NOW. &gt;&gt; I WOULD LOVE TO GET MARRIED. &gt;&gt; NOT AT THIS TIME, NOT AT THIS JUNCTURE. &gt;&gt; Narrator: TAMIS BELIEVES THE MAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP SHOULD PROPOSE. &gt;&gt; HMM. &gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT AFTER SIX YEARS, HANS ISN'T BUDGING. SO, WITH 2,000 WIGS TO CHOOSE FROM, TAMIS FIGURED OUT A WAY AROUND THIS PROBLEM -- HER THOMAS WIG. &gt;&gt; I'VE ALWAYS HAD THIS FANTASY THAT I WOULD BE PRINCE CHARMING AND THAT HE WOULD BE CINDERELLA. [ DOORBELL RINGS ] &gt;&gt; OH, MY GOSH. WHAT IN THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE? &gt;&gt; I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU DO? &gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS NIGHT PERFECT, TAMIS WANTS HANS TO PLAY HIS ROLE, TOO. SO, FOR THAT, SHE PICKED A SPECIAL WIG -- HANSINA. &gt;&gt; BEFORE I MET TAMIS, I NEVER REALLY WORE WIGS. &gt;&gt; I MADE IT JUST FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; [ CHUCKLES ] &gt;&gt; LOVE THE HAIR. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE FUNNY. [ CHUCKLES ] &gt;&gt; Narrator: FOR THE BIG PROPOSAL, TAMIS BOOKED A LOCAL RESTAURANT WHERE THEY CAN HAVE PRIVACY. HERE TAMIS PLANS TO SURPRISE HANS BY POPPING THE BIG QUESTION. &gt;&gt; WOULD YOU LIKE TO DANCE? &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; MM-HMM? &gt;&gt; WILL YOU SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WITH ME? &gt;&gt; MMM. I WILL ALWAYS BE YOUR GIRL. [ BOTH SMOOCH ] &gt;&gt; WHAT A SWEET ANSWER -- &quot;I WILL ALWAYS BE YOUR GIRL.&quot; FOREVER. &gt;&gt; [ CHUCKLES ] &gt;&gt; I JUST DECIDED I DIDN'T EVER WANT TO GROW UP. I WOULD SIT ON THE WINDOWSILL WAITING FOR PETER PAN TO COME AND GET ME. I DON'T HAVE A DIVISION BETWEEN MY WAKING LIFE AND MY DREAM LIFE BECAUSE MY LIFE IS PRETTY MUCH -- IT'S FUN. IT'S LIKE A DREAM. AND I DON'T SEE WHY EVERYBODY CAN'T DO THAT. EVERYONE CAN. JUST COME OVER AND PLAY. -- Captions by VITAC -- CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY
