Thank you, have a nice day!&quot; How was that? Was that surprising? Did Let's go through the most interesting Firstly, the barista said, &quot;Say, hello, what can will hear in a coffee shop, a restaurant, any &quot;Hello, what can I get for you?&quot; So, be &quot;What can I get for you?&quot; that's Then, in response to this, I said, &quot;Could I get to a &quot;Hi&quot; or a &quot;Hello&quot; with a &quot;Hello&quot; as well. could I get a medium decaf Americano?&quot; &quot;Could&quot; of saying &quot;Can I get,&quot; sometimes you might want and fast-paced environments, &quot;Can&quot; is not sometimes we do say &quot;Can I get,&quot; because It doesn't feel like a sit-down restaurant so you can choose: you can say Then, I said a phrase that you are going to hear a it a lot: &quot;Do you do.&quot; &quot;Do you do oat milk?&quot; &quot;Do blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.&quot; So, a certain type of drink or a certain Listening to these audios back, I didn't it all the time. I'm like, &quot;Perfect, thank you.&quot; So, if you want to say this, I think it's just me confirming, &quot;Yeah, that's thank you, perfect.&quot; I don't know Then, the barista says a question that you will Now, that's how she says it. She says, &quot;Are we that doesn't sound correct because you would want away today?&quot; But we don't often say &quot;takeaway&quot; as this question phrased like this, or you might hear in&quot; is the same thing. So, are you going to eat &quot;eating in or takeaway,&quot; &quot;eating in or sitting Sometimes, the communal &quot;we&quot; is used even though little thing that we do, maybe to include people. or taking away today?&quot; She doesn't mean &quot;me She then says, &quot;Anything else?&quot; go into a cafe or a restaurant. &quot;Are you done with your order? Is Then, she asked me an interesting question, and I it might confuse them a little bit. So, she says, want the twist as it is or warmed up?&quot; &quot;As it is&quot; to change anything. Do you want me to just pick it the twist as it is or warmed up?&quot; &quot;Do you want it you? So, you might get this when you order like might say, &quot;Want it as it is or warmed up?&quot; Or might just say, &quot;Do you want it heated up, or do conversation if you are ordering something that Then, it's time to pay. So, she says, &quot;PS8.20 then, quite a bit in this video. So, they normally ask the end. So, they'll say, &quot;PS10 then, please,&quot; And then, she starts pouring my milk into the mug, on the milk?&quot; &quot;Tell me when to stop.&quot; Some people &quot;Tell me when to stop.&quot; They go, &quot;Tell me And then I leave with a &quot;Thank bye!&quot; It's always nice to end with a little Okay, moving on to Coffee Shop Number here. So, Bez went into a coffee shop, and Hold on! Before we go for another coffee, imagine bank details for everyone to hear. Then, imagine barista and saying, &quot;Enjoy my money!&quot; That's what like if you're not careful.

Then there's that again. Then Bez asks somebody if they are serving you or you are in a &quot;Have you been busy today?&quot; Sometimes shortened to bit of an awkward silence--maybe you're getting you're waiting for your coffee--if you want to been busy today?&quot; She doesn't hear him, so she don't hear someone: &quot;Pardon?&quot; And then he repeats quite a nice word. If something's been steady, not really changing throughout the day. it's been steady, it's been reliable, it's says, &quot;Have a good rest of your day.&quot; That's Have a good rest of your day.

One of *Music* &quot;Do you just take cash?&quot; &quot;Uh, no, I'll be fine. Thank you. Cheers.&quot; &quot;Thanks. Perfect. That looks great. Now, if you remember, in the first coffee shop, That was the way of starting the service--&quot;What the server just said, &quot;Hi.&quot; So, you might &quot;Hi,&quot; and then you start your order. In this are you okay?&quot; So, sometimes that's how you and the person's behind the till, and they &quot;Come order. I'm ready for you Again, I say, &quot;Do you do iced coffees?&quot; &quot;Do you turn around and say, &quot;Oh no, sorry, we don't coffees.&quot; And then when I'm giving my order, I know my order is quite specific, and I always have a decaf iced Americano with oat milk?&quot; Like, you know? I just like to say, &quot;I know it's a if you have a very specific order, if you're very if you want: &quot;It's a bit of a weird order, Then the server asks for money because that's how she asks for money, but she doesn't say, &quot;PS3.25,&quot; &quot;Right, that is PS3.25.&quot; &quot;That is PS3.25.&quot; You might &quot;Right, that will be PS1.50.&quot; So, listen This next question is very important to establishments don't take cash. You say, &quot;Do that question. In some places, it might be the and it's quite a small market, and there's &quot;Oh, I don't know if she takes &quot;Do you take card?&quot; or &quot;Can I pay by Then she asks if I want any syrups, and again, &quot;Thanks.&quot; I say, &quot;No, I'll be fine, thanks, she hands me the coffee, she says, &quot;There you the time when they hand you your order: &quot;There &quot;There we go.&quot; And again, when I'm leaving, I say, Okay, moving on to Coffee Shop &quot;All right, do you do takeaway coffee? &quot;Yeah. Large or small?&quot; the large one?&quot; &quot;Um, yeah, that's fine. Yeah, can I have a what do you call them, like any &quot;Yeah, today I've got hazelnut, hazelnut &quot;Oh, can I have the caramel one, &quot;Never been in here before--it's &quot;I've never been here before.&quot; &quot;Brilliant, thank you very much.&quot; as well--that's lovely. Your ticket is PS3.80.&quot; &quot;Lovely, thank you. Thank you, have a nice day.&quot; Now, again, this server didn't say, &quot;How can I &quot;Hi there.&quot; Just &quot;Hi,&quot; starting the She says, &quot;Hi there,&quot; and Bez replies with, &quot;You especially in Britain. Instead &quot;You all right?&quot; &quot;You all right?&quot; Now, he's &quot;Yeah, I'm good, thank you,&quot; he's just saying &quot;Hi there,&quot; and he says, &quot;You all right?&quot; Then he orders and he says, &quot;Can I get just &quot;just&quot; if what you're ordering is pretty simple that's it. So, if you're ordering something quite just a cup of tea, please?&quot; Then she asks a pretty with, &quot;How large is a large one?&quot; He's clarifying whole lot of information. So, you can clarify with you're doing it in English, you have to be perfect Now, the next thing is really interesting. So, question we can use in a coffee shop: &quot;Do you do in this one, I don't know if you noticed, Bez was asking for like little shots of flavor. He ups aren't something that they make in that is there and they can just go, &quot;Oh, it's &quot;Do you have any syrups? Do you have any...?&quot; make for you, then you can say, &quot;Do you that is something that they would have to make, &quot;It's there.&quot; So, it's a slight difference. &quot;Do you do...?&quot; If it's something they're And you'll notice all through these audios, we &quot;amazing,&quot; &quot;perfect.&quot; I think it must be fill the silence and to confirm you're happy when she puts the coffee down in front &quot;Brilliant,&quot; like &quot;That looks great, I'm happy.&quot; It's a way of, yeah, conveying that Then towards the end, she uses a really common into his mug because maybe the milk isn't quite up for you.&quot; So, topping up means making it reach and you are halfway through your beer, you might you go to the fridge and you get another topping up means making it reach the top Now, the way she asks for the money is quite she says, &quot;Your ticket's PS2.80.&quot; She says, is quite old-fashioned--I don't hear this a lot. the amount of money that you if you hear that--I don't think you will--but Then as he's leaving, the server says, &quot;Have if someone wishes you a nice day or the rest of your day,&quot; &quot;Have a lovely Now, before we move on to the last coffee shop, I coffee shops were in villages. So, they're in to talk, and people are a bit more chatty. This you'll notice there's a lot less chit-chat. It's Let's listen to Coffee Shop Number Five. &quot;Hi, do you have green tea?&quot; &quot;Can I just get a green tea, please? Thank you.&quot; &quot;Size?&quot; please. Thank you. Perfect. Thank you.&quot; And this service starts with the classic, &quot;Hi, can in coffee shops, in restaurants. &quot;Do you have green tea?&quot; because I know a tea bag--they're probably not going to have &quot;Do you have green tea? Do you have the tea Then again, he says, &quot;Pardon?&quot; because and then I say, &quot;Just a green tea,&quot; because I it's a very simple, basic order. Now, at this coffee shop, they only accepted card, &quot;Only card, we don't accept cash.&quot; So, what he did &quot;beep,&quot; and then he said, &quot;When you're ready.&quot; so when you're ready, tap.
