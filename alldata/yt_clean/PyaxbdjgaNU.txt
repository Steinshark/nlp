Hello to the most beautiful people in the world. The first thing I would like to thank you with all my heart for your comments in the last video, the solidarity and your sweet words encouraged me a lot. Forgive me for being late, but you know travel and its difficulty. This is a very difficult, narrow and unstable time. So, I was able to post a video for you. God willing, the coming days will be better and we will return. Despite our activity and vitality, this was the last cappuccino I had in the house. I went back to remembering the memories and the sweet days that I spent in this house. The person did not spend time anywhere in the end, and at first he wanted to leave it. We ran out of the whole house, as you can see, and it is the children's room. As you also see, these are all the hangers and that. The salon is the last look at here. Everything has become empty. Here, my neighbor was coming. May God reward her well. She is bidding us farewell to my children. She bid farewell to her daughter. We were very sad and upset. Her daughter wanted to go with us very much. Because one gets really upset because he leaves people after getting to know them abroad. These people are like family, like sisters, but only. In the end, he leaves them, unfortunately, these moments were among the most difficult moments when we approached Erbil airport. I remembered when we came here for the first time. I went out on the streets and said to myself, are we going to go back here or not? I was so sad because I spent many really nice days thanking everyone who helped and supported us in this country, in the form of the Iraqi people and the Kurdish people being very kind. By the way, I would like to thank my friend Umm Shirin and her brother who helped us and stood with us from the first time we came to Erbil. May God reward them with a thousand good things and help us at this moment because they are helping us. We left Erbil and we still need them and we need their help. I also tell you that a lot of people ask me why I left Erbil, God willing. I will tell you that I was very happy with Erbil and all of Iraq and very much at ease, but the matter is mine. God willing, I will tell you about it in detail, but in the upcoming videos, what is the happiness corridor? As for what remained the path of happiness, I got used to it. It has become my second home :) Come on, God willing, O Lord, the next times will be the path of happiness rightly. Glory be to Him who subjected this to us and we were not related to Him. Oh God, make it easy for us on our journey. This is for the children. Show me what they gave you. Wow, show me what the food is. ? Now it's time to tell you where I'm going, and before I tell you, anyone who doesn't follow me on Snapchat is doing a lot of things, so follow me. There are girls on Snapchat who knew where I was right away and told me the place and the area. I was surprised and even shocked. Of course, I wish I could visit all the countries you write to me about seriously. Wherever I go, I talk to you about myself. Learn a lot from their customs, their traditions, their cultures, their food, and many things. When I go home, I will stay in a hotel, and a lot of what I eat is the issue, because the hotel means you see it only in pictures, and pictures do not always express reality completely. That is why we did not take a house. Tourist immediately we said after we stayed in the hotel for a week, what did you finish coloring? This is what I concluded. How nice. How can we go to Sharjah Airport? This is the second time because it was the first time I got off in transit from Malaysia to Erbil. That day, when I landed at this airport, I felt a psychological comfort that I had never imagined before. I mean, this is the first time I felt it. Honestly, that is the girl who discovered the country. Her name is Khadija on YouTube. Actually, I stayed in Sharjah and then I am going to Dubai. The hotel is in Dubai because there we have to go through the residency procedures. Some of you will tell me where you want to stay in Dubai or in Sharjah. These things are not yet clear. I pray that it will be facilitated. If you have any information that you can help me with, write to me in the comments. I will see it. Tell me. What do you think about where I sit or where I live? From your experience, the first time I came down, I had an indescribable feeling. By the way, I had an indescribable feeling. God willing, the country is very beautiful and very developed. And what I have told you is that I cannot describe everything. May God continue to bless and grant peace to all countries. I wished all countries would be like it. May God bless me. Every person is in his country and the people of the Emirates congratulate their country. We arrived at the hotel and finally, after the bus made a lot of noise on the road, it made us go around all of Sharjah and Dubai. I was very happy about the idea, but the children were bored and Omar was sleeping, and when he woke up he was upset. Do you know when the child sleeps and suddenly wakes up and is upset? As soon as we arrived, they gave the children gifts. I loved it. It was the move from the hotel and they also provided us with juices, in the name of God. Finally, the first time we tasted Baik food was eating Baik. By God, since the morning we had not broken our fast, we had not eaten anything but airplane food, and I was not satisfied with eating airplane food. When we first arrived, I said to my husband, "I want to taste Baik food." I mean, I had heard about it for a long time, and I did not. I tasted it. As soon as we arrived, we ordered boneless chicken and we ordered a Crispy Biggie with potato chips. It is really terrible to eat, God willing. I mean, the people of Saudi Arabia and the Emirates love it, these good and delicious foods, but the problem is that it is fattening. Let us make an agreement from now on. Don't tell me why we are fat. By the way, we eat a lot of good food every day. I see something new, something from the Omani salad, something from Kuwait, something from Bahrain, something from other countries, so I want to try them all, but I won't try them. Until finally, I saw for you, &quot;It's my pain.&quot; He said, &quot;It's my pain that makes you lose weight.&quot; I told him, &quot;My husband, I should try it, so I can lose weight :) I'm going to tell you what's going on with me, with the details.&quot; Water, water, removes toxins from the body. Come on, I'm sorry, we're going to the supermarket to get a few things because there's nothing in the hotel room. We're walking in. We didn't go out. In fact, there was a lot of coffee without added sugar . Next to the hotel, we discovered that they were Asians, so most of the food we wanted was not available. So we returned to the hotel and decided to order online. I mean, many of them work with online orders, and they come to you at the door of the room. By God, we ordered cheese, labneh, and yoghurt, which are the things that we love. I mean, we are used to them for breakfast, and that's how he prepared breakfast. This is the first thing. Breakfast in Dubai was a special and sweet feeling. One should keep remembering these memories. But one grows older and Omar passes by and says, "I was here and I was doing that." I put some oil on Sham and Omar's hair before they went to the pool for 20 minutes. The sun is strong and there is a lot of heat. Come on, go to the bathroom, go wash me. Your hair and come to the big swimming pool. I love it very much. It is the best thing. Sham and Omar are relaxing. Look, Omar and Sham, come to the room.. No, no :) They love water a lot. It is difficult for us to get them out of the water. The hotel offers free popcorn and ice cream for children every day in the restaurant.
