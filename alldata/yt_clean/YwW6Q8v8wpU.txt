Food coloring for dying eggs. Easter time. Okay, boys, sorry. I'm sorry, that round that you didn't figure it out. But I do know someone who Lucas, please help us. Oh, you're coming in here in real life? Yeah. Okay. Oh, yeah. Come on. I'm always here. Thought maybe this would have been like. I have to. I need more eggs. There's another thing eggs. If you fell, swoop, you ruined all of them. So I got. I got an egg guy. Well, hey, that's actually nice. Bring that over, too. It's empty. Yeah, there's... Yeah. So no eggs in here. I'm not prepared for this moment so much. Cause the eggs you broke all at once. I thought we would have them, I'll be right back. Lucas is also being very chill this round. I noticed. We're calm. Just three chill boys. Dude, there was a whole bunch of That's what I told you. Oh, hey, chill out. We're... so... Okay. Oh. If you take those and we do. Kind of a time swipe. Okay, we're doing a clockwipe? Yeah, we're doing a clockwipe All right, now we're back. Oh, yeah. I got my jar of eggs. Well, that's not gonna work. Well, I mean, I think we might still Let's try to do this. Another clock wipe. So you have an empty carton. And you have a full carton. And you go to the grocer and you say, at once. Garcon. Look at that. And then you just walk home. And I can confirm this won't fall at all. so eggs. But why? So you just moved twelve eggs A full carton to an empty carton. Because then you have another empty I think it's for people that use that, take their eggs out of the carton and I have one of those. Move them around. It's kind of fun. Look at that. Wow. We almost had it. So useless. But then you can also take We gotta get the rest Yeah, we're changing up the plan. Going back to plan a. Old school. Yeah, we're gonna get worked up. Monster mode. time starts now. All right, well, don't leave yet. Listen. All right, so this is. This looks. What the hell is that? It's some sort of a bowl that. it has a hole that then Look at that. Does it look like for makeup stuff? Why would it be pink? Look at that. I bet it's for a cat. Because cats don't like bananas? maybe. Get that. It doesn't seem like there's any. Cat food. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cat food. But cat food... Yes, yes, yes. All right, so now I'm gonna. I'm going to open this meow mix and I'm putting it in there. And what else are you going to do? Is there a charger? It says outlet on it. There's some sort of. You need power. You need power. I think I need power. No, power. Like there's a hole that says outlet. But then if I were to just hurt my finger. All right, let's keep up the energy. Come on. We're doing good. String, what is it for? Food? Microwave? Bananas? All right, so I put the. You want an apple? Put the cat food in there. And I don't know what this hole is for. And this. It doesn't even come apart. Smarty. Smarty life. Smarty life. Smarty lip. Smarty life. What does that say? It doesn't say life. Yes, it does. Life, smarty life. But none of this. So that. But what would it. You put your pinky in here. No, but what would a cat. Why would. Why, why, why does a cat need this? Maybe the. I don't. What happens? Oh, God. I mean, we'll get that later. Don't worry about it. You see how. Open that up. See how that says outlet on it? There's a hole. It says outlet, but then this opens. Is it powered? You gotta have. There's gotta be something else. two minutes. Maybe there's a. Maybe there's a dome. There's something that goes on top of it. Like, do I got wheels? I got oil, I got pepper. No, I got nails. Water. You think if you mix No, I don't think so. I don't understand why there's this hole here in water. There's no AC adapters. I think the water. Bring the water over here. I think water goes around this. Minus five. now there's dog food over there, right? Maybe we put dog food around Why would that be the case? Well, we need a lifeline, Stevie. Are there lifelines? Sorry, You have less than a minute. What do we do? Link? There's nowhere else that the cat food would go except right here. But there's another attachment I'm just telling you. String, like big slinky. No, just. Say everything. Say everything. Fast little cow faster. Cups. Coffee cups. Dog food. Ping pong balls. What? Why are you. Why are you saying ping pong balls minus five. God, they fit so perfectly. I think we may have had right? Just come over here and look confident. five, four, three, Two, one... time. So the cat food comes out of this bowl and it's at an angle, Well, you're all over it, major part that you missed, Lucas. I was really excited about this one. My cats are dumb, It took me a while, too. I thought those were eyeballs. So, yeah, I'm not surprised he didn't But basically, right? You put as many as you want, and you put little Oh, it's a puzzle. It's a puzzle. And when you bat. When you bat it around, you gotta be as smart as a cat. It falls out through the hole. Tricked you guys. Not the cats, though. So do you think a cat would actually. Not my cat. No. And then who loads it in? The human? No, the dog. So you're gonna load The other pets in the home. It does come with a funnel, yeah, you're supposed to load it And then the cat learns how to work this useless machine. It looks like you can have fun with it. Dang it. We're stupid. You know, sporked, is not just that it tells you the things to eat, and it exposes you to new but it's backed by a team of people who We're not talking about AI articles here. This is the real thing. So if you want to check eating the stuff and taste testing it, you can go to their unevited, and unevent unevited videos of the team taste testing to booze balls to frozen salmon. New videos every Tuesday and Thursday. Cause they are taste testing some stuff, YouTube Sporked Okay. You can no longer win the prize. It's about pride I think you need to get at least one of Otherwise, I think you are gonna have to So that's now what's on the line if you want an apology and your time starts now. Cause we didn't try so All right. This is little super, super simple thing. But it has a ridge here, has a circular ridge. It looks like it could fit. You see that right there? You see those indentions? Yep. There's two indentions. It goes off something, but then is this. Is it something that goes over a light in, a gymnasium? Well, let's go see what kinds Okay, we're familiar with all the stuff. By this point. They may have added something. All the eggs are still gone, No egg. An egg would fit perfectly. It seems like it would Oh, you know what? Not a scooper, maybe? Nope, not that. Fishing lure. Fishing composition notebook. Lots of twine. I think I can push this. Cups water again. Massage oil. Whole black pepper. You think a black pepper Why would you do that? What would be the point? Elmer's Glue? Tops, bottles. Do you think that thing a yarn can fit? It would go into the We got all types of yarn. Look at this. We got string. We've got red string, we got black string. I feel like it might do something. String. It matches. You think you can push Just bring the green yarn. Minus five. But look, I can think. What about shoving a banana through it? If you shove a banana through it, Yes, yes, yes. Minus five. No, but give me a banana. It will. It will, Stevie. It will work. Prove it. Prove it wrong. What about an apple or an orange You need a banana to be sliced. All right, so what are these? This is some sort of... perler cheez its... cow. It's working perfectly. Wheels. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Look. Kiwi. Kiwi, kiwi. Yes. It's a kiwi thing. It's a kiwi thing. Yes, yes, yes. It's a kiwi thing. You wouldn't understand. So you take. You put the kiwi through there... and. It protects it so you can put a kiwi on your keychain. Oh, you just. You just squirted on Nick. What? I don't. Maybe try. Oh, you know what? I bet you about push hard enough. Yeah, look, look. It just peels it. Not really. But she didn't say minus five. You destroyed it. Do you think maybe you cut it in half? Is there a knife over there? 1 minute. I don't think so. Maybe it's just a hat for a kiwi. Like, just put it on as an ornamental. All right. You do you need some massage oil to Well, it's kind of splitting what is this? This is needles. Ah, there's another thing. The same color link. She said another thing, the same color. Uh, find some green. Well, here's a knife. Here's a green thing. Yeah, bring that green. Bring the green thing. This is. There's no way this is it. What I believe it might be. What?

Is there prettier way to do this? There sure is Stevie, this attaches. I did it perfectly. And also does bananas. Yeah. Okay. It does bananas. It does kiwi. Any fruit, really, that you want. You got that thing. So this goes in there like that. See it then. You didn't do that. You didn't do that, right? I sure didn't. All right. It's in there. You got it in there. And then give that man a kiwi. And what does he do? Give a man a kiwi. Oh, wait, no, I think it's. It makes sense to be that way. This way. So it's like a two in one thing, right? You can cut the kiwi in half. The kiwi in half, do it on the side. I always forget you I'm sorry. And then you do attach it back. And so you finish cutting the kiwi and then you just kind you know. Look at that. Look at that. Oh, you sticking in beautiful kiwi. Oh, and you make kiwi slice. I don't love that. I don't love what you've done, beautiful kiwi.
