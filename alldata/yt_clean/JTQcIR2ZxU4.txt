Dude, let's take her to a dealership and just buy her whatever car she wants. - She probably at work till six. - I think it'd be funny if the car we hit, if we just - No, you can't just give - Why not? That'd be funny. - It's not funny to give People can't afford that kinda insurance. - She could just sell it. - No. - Why? - No. - Please. - No. - No? - Please, no, because you don't, no. No, no. - Please. - No. - Well what can I do? Can I go buy her a new car? - Can you buy her a new car? You don't even know who she is. - Yeah or he, it could be a guy.

This car online is worth $3,000. We made a little scratch, a big scratch and a dent that we already fixed, which means we should give her $20,000. - By that math, yes we should. - Okay. - I'm whipping it! - No You need to get out, sir. You need, sir. You need to get out the vehicle. You are not allowed to drive anymore. No, no. - I'm driving. - No! Pull him out, pull him out, pull him out. - We need six lawn chairs and we need to like camp out right, here waiting for the person. I think that would be hilarious. This is now the desert - All right Chandler, we're at Walmart. - Yeah, Garrett hit a car, so we're going to go camp by the car and wait for the person to come back. - Oh yeah, they need chairs. They need four of those. Perfect. - So this is what we got here. We got some chairs, we got some checkers, you can't really see it. We got UNO. I got a sleeping bag. - I can't hear you now, 'cause there's very loud. - Very angry! So we got UNO, I got a sleeping bag and - So you are camped out - In the Lamborghini. The car we hits right over there. - Right there? - Whenever he slash she pulls up, we're going to skirt, skirt, be like, yo, you just got a new car. - This Lamborghini? - No, my mom said I My mom wants me to have money. It's kind of lame. - I mean, we all want - I just want to give it all away. Chris's mom's calling. This is Jimmy, Garrett How does that make you feel? - Jesus Christ, with the Lamborghini? - No, no. With the stupid red truck. - Oh. I mean, is everybody safe? - Yeah. Yeah. Well by hit, I mean - I think it's fine.

This kind of reminds me of the desert. Remember when we were in the desert? - Yeah. - Yeah, this reminds me of that. - So how do we go from a Lamborghini to a tent in a parking lot? - Chris is going to jump Go, go, go. - Oh! I did it! - Hey Chris- - It's crazy. That's insane. Oh look, it's Garrett. - Garrett, you made a dent right here. Let's not put a dent on this side. You can do this here.

I just handed him one and he's like, I've never had that before. What is this? And I was Was that not the best Wait, give me one. - Chandler, no. - Give me one. - Chandler stole our Twinkies. - These are so good. - We need to throw these away.

Hold on Sir. Sir, is that your car? - Your car? - Is that your car? - Yeah. - When we were- I hate to randomly throw this on you but when we were pulling out, we accidentally scratched it a little bit. - Oh yeah. - No, this isn't a prank. He's well- We're YouTubers but we So I didn't know what to do about. - We were waiting for you so we could buy- - We waited for you since - Yeah, yeah, we- - Oh, seriously? - Yeah, 'cause we felt bad. - What do you want to do about it? 'Cause we were pulling out Garrett right here- - I'm a little too tight. - What do you think? Do you think a couple or 500 bucks? - 'Cause honestly, this came off and we kind - Awe, did it really? - But I don't know if it . - The whole thing was dented in and we popped it back out. So, we're just going to give It $9,000. We had 10 but we had to pay a thousand - There's no way that's real. - Yeah it is. - It's real, 100%. - We got it from the bank earlier. - Yeah, it is. - Get out of here. - Yes sir, 100%. 100%. - This car's not even worth that much. - It's not even worth 9,000. That's fine. Yeah. Here you go, take it. - There's no way man. - Yeah. - 100%. Yes sir. - Yep, $9,000. - There's no way, that - I don't like money to be honest. - Ah, man. - Here you go, take it. - That's crazy. - Ah. - There's- - You have to take it. - Yeah, you have to take it. - We waited all day for this. - That way you can buy a new car, 'cause we totaled this car. Yeah. - We really did. - All right, well, I don't want it. So I'll just leave it there and you can do what you want with it. - What are you shooting this for? - Oh, YouTube. I mean we might as well Garrett, if you're going - I'm sorry man. - It's cool man. - I'm super sorry about your car. - I'm like dumbfounded, I don't even know what to say. - It's all good. - I mean, well, I mean, but it's not worth that to fix that. You know what I'm saying? - So we don't have enough, we need more? - Yeah. That's what I was going to say. - We got to get more money. - We shouldn't have for the parking space. Well, that was all. We can just shake and - Hey, like that makes me feel bad. - No. - Just shake my hand. - You shouldn't. - So does that mean I'll - Yeah, of course. - I mean, I'm not that type of person, like that makes me feel bad that it's all- - No, don't worry about it. - You really shouldn't, you really shouldn't. We set out camp, we made a day out of it. - Yeah. We had fun. - You got me, I don't - Now that I just get away $9,000 to a random person, what do I do? - You can hit my car anytime. - I can? Thank you. - I'll be parked around - Okay Guys, let me know if I can hit your car. Garrett, you hug him. Tell him you're sorry for hitting his car. - Yeah. Apologize. - Hey man. - The bad son, the bad son. - That was, that was, yeah, please. - Don't touch him. - That was bad. Stay away from him, please. That's the world's way of saying, you already hit his - So, don't touch him. - All right man. - Well this one's really - Take care. - Hey. You have a good day. - Take care of those . - Have a good- - Yeah, same. - Have a good day. - Say what now? - I said, it totally doesn't feel right walking away with this. - Oh no, you're fine. You're totally fine. - Thank God, his cars still works. - Yeah. - I thought we totaled it. - I know. Goodbye. - See you later, man. - I wonder what he's going to do with that money. - I wonder what his name is. Now that we took care of that, can I have the Lamborghini keys? Imagine if my mom would've let me give him this Lamborghini. - He would've lost his mind. Actually, knowing him now, He barely accepted the $9,000. - Hey, wait, we should - Oh yeah. All right. - Lamborghini, give us a second. We paid the guy we hit, nine grand. We picked up everything that we camped in for seven hours. And now we're going to take back to the dealership I don't want it anymore. Driving a car that costs over $200,000 is literally stressful. I'd rather spend that and do good things with it. Plus, just to be a hundred percent real, people who are friends with me just because I drive a Lamborghini, I don't want them to be friends with me. So, I really have no interest in super expensive cars like this. - Wait, so you said, you're friends that like you don't want them anymore? - Yeah. - All right. I'll see you later. - As you saw in this video, I'm homeless. Please go to shopmrbeast.com so I can not be homeless. Thanks.
