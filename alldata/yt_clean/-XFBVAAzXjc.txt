We're under fire. He's got an automatic weapon, of the synagogue. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Pittsburgh, &gt;&gt; 34-10: Please send the medics &gt;&gt; I've got one alive. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Robert Bowers into the Tree of Life synagogue and allegedly kills &gt;&gt; 7-1: Suspect's talking about &gt;&gt; We have multiple casualties We have three officers &gt;&gt; Members of the Tree of Life conducting a peaceful service in were brutally murdered by a simply because of their faith. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Another act of the country again left to ask, Could it have been prevented?&quot; &gt;&gt; It's just been 24 hours since into this synagogue and said, &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Over the past on a resurgent I've seen its ideas migrate into I've seen violence in cities And now this: the deadliest on the Jewish community in I fear there will be more &gt;&gt; Blood and soil! &gt;&gt; Today's alt-right &quot;Unite the over 6,000 people... &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: A year ago, the shocked the nation in Charlottesville, Virginia. &gt;&gt; Anti-white! &gt;&gt; You will not replace us! You will not replace us! &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: They spilled blood militant and unafraid. &gt;&gt; Panic and horror in A car slams into a crowd of &gt;&gt; When a driver plowed killing a young woman &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: White supremacists and injured dozens of others. After Charlottesville, behind the violence. With a team of reporters, called the Rise Above Movement, They were involved in melees Following our investigation, of RAM are now facing But the most extreme I've been looking at is called Atomwaffen means &quot;atomic The group embraces Nazi ideology of minorities, gays, and Jews. It calls for lone wolf acts of much like the massacre For months, my colleagues and I to a former Atomwaffen member, who asks us to call him John He says the group's ranks So after Charlottesville, people &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: So if protests &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: John tells me that draws from the writings named James Mason, in the 1980s called &quot;Siege.&quot; (explosion booms) &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Atomwaffen has made for all of its members. &gt;&gt; &quot;Siege&quot; by James Mason. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: To them, Mason is of Nazi leaders, from American Nazi Party founder who in turn took his inspiration I learn that Mason's writings at the University of Kansas. &gt;&gt; The bulk of the collection &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Rebecca Schulte is of the Wilcox Collection, an archive of contemporary Is this the only collection &gt;&gt; Yes, this is his archive. We are the only ones &quot;Enclosed with this letter is the newsletter of the National &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Mason's archive is His writing lays out an He says the white race in by people of color, in positions of power. &quot;We do not wish for law and the continued existence of this capitalist Jew system. We wish for anarchy and chaos, the system while are trying to keep the pieces &gt;&gt; And this is a paste-up. You know, it's got... see that? &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah. Mason advocated attacks on media, and the courts. Notorious killer Charles Manson and the two had a long &gt;&gt; So this is an object that Charlie Manson knitted in prison and gave to James Mason. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: So it's some kind &gt;&gt; Yes, I... &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Some kind of &gt;&gt; ...kind of knitting, yeah. I don't know exactly. Looks like they corresponded &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah, it looks like &gt;&gt; Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Like '81 to '90s. We've had the collection and we haven't seen (chuckles) &gt;&gt; But in the last few years, coming to use the collection. So that's always an indicator that there's something happening We don't always know what it is. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: So people are again-- that's very interesting. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: We're not the first &gt;&gt; No, you're not. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Back in New York, agreed to talk over video chat Ali Winston. (video chat program ringing) &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: When you say it sounds to me like you're basically terrorist acts. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: So, how many... would you say there are? &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Or were? &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Wow. (radio squawking) &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: John tells me that the group, I need to start in Tampa, Florida. Atomwaffen was founded in 2015 a National Guardsman He moved into this with three other members One of them, an 18-year-old high named Devon Arthurs, would bring of the authorities. &gt;&gt; Friday night, Tampa police Devon Arthurs. He confessed to killing his 22-year-old Jeremy Himmelman and &gt;&gt; Arthurs told cops a fourth participates in neo-Nazi &gt;&gt; The common thread that was neo-Nazi beliefs. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Why had Arthurs two of his roommates? His father agreed to talk to me &gt;&gt; I was working in my office, and it was Devon. And he said, &quot;Dad, I'm sorry. I've really messed up. I said, &quot;What's, what's the What's going on?&quot; &quot;The two guys, the two that were they're dead. I, I shot them. They upset me and I shot them.&quot; I tried to hold it together and &quot;Put the gun down and go turn yourself Right now.&quot; All I was hearing, &quot;I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I said, &quot;Just turn yourself in.&quot; &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Alan Arthurs says to neo-Nazi ideas when So is this Junior ROTC? What is... what is... &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's ROTC &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: He was really &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: What do you think &gt;&gt; There were two other brothers that were obviously &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: So you think he because there were other kids in the group? Yes, definitely. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Arthurs says his became increasingly strained. &gt;&gt; By that time, we weren't you know... &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Devon ended up He eventually moved into the and the other Atomwaffen Did you ever talk to Devon &gt;&gt; He said that he would not, when he figured out what Brandon he couldn't live with himself. That's all he's ever said to me. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Tampa police refuse But I obtain video of Devon Over and over, he tells &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Inside police discovered guns, radioactive material, On a dresser was of Oklahoma City (explosion echoes) &gt;&gt; Holy cow! About a third of the building &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: On April 19, 1995, detonated a truck bomb in front of the Oklahoma City Scores were killed. For you, what are the lessons about Oklahoma City? &gt;&gt; I think it's not only it's lessons that lone wolf terrorism. It doesn't take a large to cause mass casualty. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Kerry Myers was an who investigated the I show Myers the crime scene from the Atomwaffen apartment. &gt;&gt; Do we have close-ups of that? &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: They document a wide range of including some of the same used by McVeigh in his &gt;&gt; They were making bombs. This is a bomb maker's workshop. There's the cooler. This is the HMTD. This is actually what caused and rightfully so. HMTD is not very common, it requires a process and you &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: And how powerful is I mean, is this something... &gt;&gt; It goes off about 14,000 feet It's probably more powerful than They could make a car bomb... If these materials were put and it went off in this it'd kill or seriously in this classroom. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: So, obviously these Are we focusing too much on a that's not really a threat? &gt;&gt; Well, in this case, we have shot with an assault rifle, and here to blow up a car, blow up blow up this room. We have the same basic that the Boston Marathon &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: The night of Brandon Russell was also by local police and the FBI. He told a different story. He said the explosives were his, that he was only using them Atomwaffen was nothing more The police released Russell They even gave him a ride home Russell promptly disappeared. He met up with another and began driving south. As the men drove, the FBI issued on explosives charges. &gt;&gt; We had his picture. We were told that he could going up near Turkey Point for That's all we knew. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: That's all you &gt;&gt; That was it. He turned into the Burger King. I put my patrol car right behind his car to block it in. And I didn't even think, I just And he looked at me and he and before I gave him reaction I just grabbed his arm and Do you have any weapons on you? Do you have any weapons on you?! &gt;&gt; Put your hands behind your &gt;&gt; He was shaking, because I didn't know what he All I could think is that he had because he was so nervous. Stop fidgeting. Why are you fidgeting? &gt;&gt; What are we going to find in &gt;&gt; Guns, ammunition. &gt;&gt; You have at least two long in excess of 1,000 rounds of homemade body armor, no It was the absence of the other that was a little bit &gt;&gt; He is too nervous, man. &gt;&gt; We were very, very thankful away from that car, because the outcome of that event could for everybody involved, based on &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Given all the as well as the ammunition. And I believe they had loaded in the center console When we found all the weapons, that we had just stopped &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: The Monroe County but it's still not clear what Brandon Russell He had the weapons and dozens of people, and the FBI bulletin said the nearby Turkey Point Russell eventually to illegal possession He was sentenced to five years But according to Devon Arthurs, Russell wasn't the only threat &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: It's unclear in response to Arthurs' plea The FBI won't talk to me about But here is what I do know: and its violence didn't end. Seven months later in Virginia, Atomwaffen follower Nick Giampa his ex-girlfriend's parents. They had objected Giampa has yet to stand trial, but the 17 year old appeared to His social media accounts were Weeks later, in California, Sam for allegedly killing Blaze a gay Jewish college student. Shortly after the arrest, identifying Woodward as a member Woodward has pleaded not guilty, but in a cache of confidential Atomwaffen celebrated They referred to Woodward as a Three killings after the arrest of Brandon Devon Arthurs' predictions of seemed to have come true. But Arthurs had given police &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: He claimed inside the military. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: From everything Devon Arthurs is a deeply He gave conflicting explanations and was ultimately deemed But as I continue my his description of Atomwaffen is checking out. Atomwaffen's confidential support Arthurs' claim that the And they reveal the existence of as &quot;hate camps,&quot; in which provide training in firearms One hate camp early this year In Death Valley, on the border Atomwaffen filmed themselves The group was drawn because of its association They made a pilgrimage This small gap in the rock opens into a massive, Manson planned to found an after the apocalypse. Atomwaffen's communication show was convened by a member &quot;Komissar.&quot; I'm able to identify Komissar based in Las Vegas. Hubsky isn't a soldier himself, but claimed to have been He boasted in Atomwaffen chats about his short-barreled CZ Hubsky discussed attacks on and claimed to have of the West Coast power grid. At Hubsky's Death Valley and at other Atomwaffen the group shoots Their members fire assault and clear rooms. Hubsky hoped to organize for Atomwaffen and encouraged a Nevada weapons facility The idea was for Atomwaffen in advanced firearms tactics. I contacted Front Sight, about the group. They agreed to meet with me out (guns firing) &gt;&gt; Front Sight is unique. We're a 550-acre firearms about 40 minutes outside We have 50 ranges and the capacity of at one time. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: When did you first the Atomwaffen leader who wanted &gt;&gt; I believe initially we were and you asked questions. And as a response to that, with our law enforcement and that was enough to convince to not be coming to Front Sight &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Hi, Michael, from ProPublica and &quot;Frontline.&quot; I'm in Las Vegas and still interested in talking When I reach Hubsky, he'd been banned for life He tells me he left Atomwaffen He won't go on camera But using information from the I'm able to identify One of them agrees He's a 20-something army veteran who asks me to call him He came back from a combat tour &gt;&gt; (distorted): There were that were disenchanted I'd say about half the guys in I think a lot of guys, they're They're looking for answers. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: How big would you the white nationalist movement &gt;&gt; (distorted): There's They keep quiet about it, You can get in a lot of trouble. Going onto Facebook, I never &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: How did the group and service members? &gt;&gt; (distorted): We definitely We would say they had the that the National Socialists of that people of the alt-right Take an average 19-year-old His only experience of war versus some guy like me, who in a war. People looked up You were at least using the that they had given you &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: When you guys did what kind of training was it? What did you, what kind of skills were shared? &gt;&gt; (distorted): Going medical, how to wage A lot of the Iraq and Afghan they took what they saw the doing and applied it Jews were the number-one enemy. We would say the Jews were the the homosexuals, &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: By studying my colleagues and I develop of more than 80 Atomwaffen Seven of these men I already know about Atomwaffen and his time But there are also three and three military veterans. And my sources say I want to better understand and the military. I go to see Professor at the University of Chicago. She's been researching of the white power movement. We're looking at a current group and they are actively recruiting Does that surprise you? &gt;&gt; Not at all. That's a strategy pioneered in the period of my study, and continued throughout One thing to understand is that there's always a correlation and this kind of vigilante and revolutionary white power So if you look, for instance, at the surges in Ku Klux Klan they align more consistently with the return of veterans and the aftermath of war anti-immigration, populism, or any of the other factors that to explain them. Nationalist fervor, those are all worse predictors &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Postwar periods with with an upsurge white-supremacist activity? &gt;&gt; Always, yes. Belew outlines a long history who became key figures in the George Lincoln Rockwell, and founder Richard Butler, and founder Louis Beam, Vietnam veteran and Timothy McVeigh, and Oklahoma City bomber. &gt;&gt; It's important to remember, that join this movement, we're talking about a tiny, not percentage of veterans. But within this movement, those are playing an enormously in instruction of weapons, paramilitary activist &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: When we speak in this movement today, leaderless resistance. Can you explain that to me? Leaderless resistance what we would understand today the idea that you can recruit of committed activists, and then they will behave on in a cell without direct ties If we think, for instance, about Timothy McVeigh is sort of of leaderless resistance. He's in an infantry unit and is involved in white power He's consistently involved in right up to the moment We know that this is part of the and an act of leaderless But we have this memory of that And as a result, I think a decisive stop &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: That because we as being an outgrowth that it has been around for that is modeling the military, that is involving military that the authorities have never to put a stop to it. &gt;&gt; That's right. The military response like the court response and the police response reflects the many ways that our to deal with this kind of &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: In Washington, a at the Department of Homeland to draw attention to some of In 2009, Daryl Johnson wrote an looking at the rise of white and their connection &gt;&gt; The wars that have gone on in we had the rise of Islamophobia. That's a huge factor in both and the militias that rally with but also the white supremacist of other nations &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Johnson's report a growing terrorist threat from and anti-government groups, and military veterans. &gt;&gt; What we've seen happen was released is basically has come to fruition. And it's actually worse than And I'm afraid that more more innocent civilians, and faith-based communities are and actually victimized It's like every month we have a shooting, a stabbing, even &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Today Johnson's but its publication nearly a provoked a political backlash and veterans' groups. The report was retracted &gt;&gt; Our unit got shut down and then the money started So these communities are to fend for themselves. This threat is out there... &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: After speaking to two former Homeland Security who say that the government and out of position for dealing with the For months, I've been trying to especially at the Department No one at the Pentagon-- will agree to an interview. But Congressman Keith Ellison He's written a letter to the demanding an accounting of of extremists. &gt;&gt; Well, let me tell you, in our nation's military. I have very close relatives who and I can tell you that it's an even in my family, To think that somebody who does of the U.S. military, and actually wants to use that is revolting to me, and I hope that people in the military &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Right-- we've of one neo-Nazi group who are &gt;&gt; Is that Atomwaffen? What do you make of that? &gt;&gt; Well, I think that they have this is a strategic initiative They want their people to go There's a real legitimate and I think that we've got to be &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: The Pentagon with a letter stating that the new recruits. The D.O.D. also said it had of extremist activity and had disciplined I put those numbers of the Southern Poverty &gt;&gt; That's laughable. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I do. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: So you just, you &gt;&gt; I think it's crazy-low. I mean, look, hate groups are to join the military, and this was something that's both in FBI reports and to gain these skills. There's not only going to be 27 I don't know, one-and-a-half to in the United States, who are, It's not possible. I think it's actually... That's just an indicator, to me, of how low a priority it is We presented the military like the Armed Services with 130 profiles off of the like, equivalent of Facebook, &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Nazi Facebook. And we keep sending stuff like, examples of people... &gt;&gt; Saying, yeah, he looks like he might be And, you know, most of the time from them. I just think that the military put on it to put this If that means shuffling around We don't want another McVeigh, You just can't have this. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: With nobody at the I sit down with a former who has handled white &gt;&gt; Okay. And I can see this is a response who's apparently asked a &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah. &gt;&gt; As a follow-up to some in these articles &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Major General served as the deputy the second-highest-ranking JAG He later oversaw the military &gt;&gt; It sounds like they and they laid out for the reader that they, they approach and that they believe they've &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: And from that, a handle on it, &gt;&gt; Yeah, and, I mean, that they're doing all this. This looks very thorough to me and looks like &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: So it's been put &quot;Look, this is a very small The vast bulk of service members You're disparaging the whole Do you think that's true? No, I think it's too important. There's no question that there that would like for people to go to acquire the training And how we could screen all you know, is pretty difficult. But there always could be where people could hide out &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: In its letter the D.O.D. also said it the Atomwaffen members But they didn't say All I know about is that only a Marine, Vasilios Pistolis-- was court-martialed and expelled In response to our questions, sent a statement saying she on individual cases but, participation has never been tolerated under the Uniform Code She added that commanders are &quot;encouraged to be preventive and they are doing that.&quot; I've been writing stories about and talking to insiders And it seems like the group From federal prison, Atomwaffen issues a thinly veiled threat people he believes are leaking &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: by the group's Texas cell, who calls himself Rape. In 2017, Atomwaffen began from appearing in public but I find pictures from an Denton can be seen at the rally and then afterwards posing with with his mask off. I get a tip that Denton a black metal festival here (heavy metal music playing) After a year of tracking I have a chance to confront &gt;&gt; (singing growled lyrics) &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: If I do find them I'm not sure what to expect. (distorted metal music playing) The show is packed. Most of the concert-goers look but I do spot a few obscure on some people's clothing. I find Rape drinking outside, along with two other Atomwaffen I recognize from my reporting. Are you Rape? I'm A.C. I wanted to come out here and &gt;&gt; No comment. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: You're not going &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Are you worried &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Atomwaffen members of multiple murders, and their with violent threats. But after all of the online Rape and the others aren't And they are far less aggressive than the skinhead gangs All right, thanks. Hey, Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; Hey, how are you doing? &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: I met Rape out &gt;&gt; How'd that go? &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: I was kind of because they talk all this but they were just kind of If they were wanting to do they wouldn't do it publicly. These guys, they're not stupid. They're not like &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Jeremiah says I He has a direct relationship intellectual leader, Did you ever get to talk to &gt;&gt; We heard him over a couple I never met him in person, Rape and Mason had their own &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: What kind of sense when you were talking to him &gt;&gt; I thought he was a genius. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: In propaganda Atomwaffen say that Mason until they located him. They pose for photos with Mason and celebrate their I'm unable to find a phone but I learn that he's living Mason has no online profile-- no social media, he doesn't even He spent time in a Colorado for menacing someone A bankruptcy filing from a few reveals a solitary life, working at Kmart I've gotten several possible and I begin to search Then, I get a call. It's Mason and he wants to talk &gt;&gt; Whenever you're ready. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: that the Atomwaffen Division How many members... &gt;&gt; I don't have the foggiest &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: But they come visit &gt;&gt; On occasion, they will come I'm always happy to meet &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Mason is evasive I try to get him to talk about and violence linked &gt;&gt; I'm glad I didn't know about because if I did know, and I don't want to be involved &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: You don't want to &gt;&gt; I do not urge anybody but when it gets done, I kind of welcome the chaos. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: What did you think the guy who allegedly drove the in Charlottesville? &gt;&gt; I say bless his heart, because he sure is in a jam. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: So you're &gt;&gt; Oh, very sympathetic. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: To you, &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: What did you think &gt;&gt; Another hero. &gt;&gt; The white race is in danger. And it's not by accident. It's driven. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Who's planning it? We know it's the Jews. I mean, we know that. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Mason has a lot the kind of anti-Semitic I've come to expect But I'm struck &gt;&gt; With Trump winning that and it was a surprise, anything could be possible. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: After decades of Mason says Trump &gt;&gt; As Trump says, and he has it the front of his hat, In order to make America you'd have to make America It's interesting. We're headed (crowd singing) &gt;&gt; The darkest day in the said the mayor, at the memorial forming... &gt;&gt; ...outside the synagogue mourners struggled to process &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: I'm in Pittsburgh, and just days after the massacre Before he allegedly Robert Bowers posted on social Jews helping immigrant invaders Kathleen Belew &gt;&gt; Even a cursory look at his that he is decisively part &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: What did you see looking through those accounts? &gt;&gt; His last post expressed that and it's an anti-Semitic rant. But it also repeats twice the that he needs to protect that he's identifying Jews That what he means there And then, through the rest of there's a whole bunch of other All of that content is deeply, but is historic. We have a history. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: You've seen it &gt;&gt; Absolutely. I think this is an example of in that it is a... what appears but someone who is motivated by a worldview, and by a social who push and enable violence. This movement has been using &gt;&gt; Our community was devastated with this senseless slaughter The entire community was The Jewish community absolutely but the entire Pittsburgh &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Retired FBI agent is the director of security of Pittsburgh. Even while Pittsburgh was he says neo-Nazi propaganda was &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: And what... what's &gt;&gt; These are posters that are up Flyers, posters, stickers. This week in particular &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: After what's you have a fascist group &gt;&gt; Yes, and I got numerous &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Orsini says even he had decided to take &gt;&gt; We have put casualty bags in each one of our synagogues There's tourniquets, there's wound packing material. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: And so basically live-saving kits, in the &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: ...and other &gt;&gt; In every one of our major &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: It's kind of sad. &gt;&gt; It's incredibly sad, um, to think we're in a day where we have to worry for people going in to pray. &gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Pittsburgh is still and the questions it can these kinds of killings be I now know the FBI is looking Agents in several states have with former members. And it turns out the bureau Robert Bowers' relationship with connections to Atomwaffen. But what I've learned covering white supremacist and that they draw from a deep in America.
