Don't listen to a word these a**holes was sayin. You just keep doing them pushups every day. You just gonna live to be a hundred? I agree with Teter. He does look about 100. It ain't what I f***ing said. How long does it take y'all to brush your f***ing teeth? Do you need a towel? I need f***ing privacy. Don't be ashamed of what God gave you. Yeah. There's no little people in the world, just little penises. I'm going to give you two because we're out of the big ones. Are you some b*tches? Just give me some time in here by myself. Well, well, well, look who's back in town. Congrats on the win in Redding. Thanks, amigo. Happy birthday. Lloyd. I hope you have a good one. My day ends like yours began. It'll be good enough for me. Thank you. Have a barrel racer for breakfast, I see. Oh, no. Bro. He's a intermittent fasting. Get ready for swimsuit season, huh? Yeah. Cold water doesn't bother him too much, so he's just.

Whatever you want it to be. Yeah. Would you stop biting that f***ing garbage? Dinner's almost ready. You're wasting your time, Teter. No one's going to eat a thing that you cook. Yo when does Gator get back? Thursday. Thursday. I'm going to be dead by then. I can already feel my organs shutting down. Walker, do you know any hunger songs? No. Oh, no. I'm good. Come on, baby, I keep cooking. You keep not eating. I need you strong for later. F*** it. I'm so hungry. I'll eat anything right now. Oh I wouldn't, it's probably going to be. Come on, come on. Don't f***ing lie. Good or bad? It's f***ing great. It is? F***ing great! Yeah. I'm in. Uh uh uh. Wait your turn. I've slaved over this f***ing meal. What's in it? Everything, baby. I think there's a vegetable that could. Be like a vegetable bisque. Kind of like little sausages. Just everything baby. Tomato. This baby doll is my favorite. It's my favorite. And I don't know if that's chicken. I'm hungry. You ever heard of manners? I'm the short fat guy. I don't know, it's just kind of different. What does that mean? Like, what's in it? Oh, sure. But I haven't tasted anything quite like this. What do you call it? Some b*tch. For f***'s sakes. What does that mean? It means it's good for you, honey. What does that mean? Literally everything from the cow that nobody else wants. It's the whole cow. You mean everything in the cow? Evidently. I got an eyeball. That's disgusting. It's still good. Good lord. Looks like you boys could use some beer, huh? Oh my goodness. You all right to drink, boss? Lord, I've come to the conclusion that the only thing on this earth that can kill me is me. And you dipsh*ts feel like losing a week's wages to the boss. Let's go. Can someone explain to me how this whole deal is working out? Oh, that. You know, that's what you call a constant state of evolution. Well, look at the big words from Jake. Are we playing hold em now? Play anything you want to lose your money to. I'm gonna let you know when we play cards, we'd like to talk a lot of trash, so don't get your feelings hurt. All right, well, if one of you boys think you can insult me, give it your best shot. I don't mind if I do. No no no no no no no no no no. No. Oh! I'll do the smacking. Oh, I want to make a sting next time. All right, we're done. You got him? No, no. Come on. Jimmy! On you, Fred. Oh, look, you proved your point, Fred. I think he's got it. I told him to f***ing stay down. Fred. F***! Oh! Ow ow. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. What's the rule about fighting, Fred? You want to fight somebody, you come fight me. I'll fight you all goddamn day. I'm the one that started it. It wasn't him. It was me. Hoi Hoi. You see this? You know what this means. This means. Don't f***ing touch Fred. Don't f***ing touch. Now you guys can go get the supper that you didn't earn. Get out of here! Get out of here!
