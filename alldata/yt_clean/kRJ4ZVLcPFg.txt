In the previous decade, the police and FBI had been slow to recognize the threat [camera snapping] Now, Colombo and the city's mafia families were in their sights. [dramatic music] In September 1966, the FBI and Queens District Attorney's Office made its first breakthrough: a massive bust at the La Stella Restaurant in the east of the city. - La Stella is a restaurant and they brought in the mob chiefs from all over the country, and they all sat down and broke bread and went over their operations.

[dramatic music] Colombo, as a family head, was now on the law enforcement radar. [dramatic music] In 1966, he was subpoenaed to stand as a witness in a federal It meant appearing before what's known under the American system as a grand jury. - Well, everybody's afraid in a federal grand jury because it forces people and give testimony.

But when he came to court, and refused to testify, insisting he was just - One of the codes of the mob is don't make yourself a target. Don't make yourself to go out there and bring attention to you and to our operation, what they call our thing, Cosa Nostra. The code of silence is held by a lot of different groups. And the old bosses believed and your mouth shut. [dramatic music] - [Narrator] His strict observance of this tradition cost him. His punishment was 30 days [dramatic music] But for Joe Colombo, this was an epiphany. He realized what attracted the FBI and police to him was his wealth without any visible source of income. So he devised a perfect solution to deal with the new heat from the FBI. [lively music] He would become an ordinary working Joe, and he passed down a diktat had to hold down a real job [lively music] Colombo led by example. He worked as a salesman based here at 86th Street On their books, the Godfather [dramatic music] In reality, he conducted his Now, when pressed by the authorities, he could explain his lifestyle [lively music] The money flooded in from Colombo was starting to get He headed across town to party and enjoyed the good life in Manhattan.

He didn't wanna look like a poor schlep. He just didn't buy a suit off the rack. The suits were tailor-made silk shirts. He had everything made. Everything was tailored. He was meticulous about his clothes. [dramatic music] - [Narrator] By now, other mobsters had learned this was not a good idea. Flashing the cash drew the - Carlo Gambino, you'd never or checking out with women. He was just low key. [dramatic music] - [Narrator] And the other [dramatic music] Colombo had reignited and the income tax authorities who started to look even more closely at his finances. $35,000 a year and tailor-made suits and shirts did not add up. So the FBI decided to go after Colombo. [dramatic music] In 1970, his son, Joe Jr., was arrested for melting down silver coins to extract precious metals. Colombo viewed this as designed to get at him. It was the final storm. Now he hit upon a radical around his affairs: civil rights. [indistinct singing] After all, this was a rich time. for civil rights activism. Across America, street [indistinct singing] The African American Civil Rights movement was changing the face of America and inspired many other - We gonna walk together. We are going sing together. We're gonna moan together. And after while, we'll have [crowd cheering] [dramatic music] - [Narrator] So Colombo From a campaign office the former hitman prepared to and into the glare of - We feel that the people have had it and the Italian people in which number 38 million, as time has been going on - [Narrator] He exploited in the Italian American - He claimed that Italians were There was some truth in that. At that particular time, you on Wall Street, in law or banking firms, and a lot of Italian Americans of organized crime or [dramatic music] - [Narrator] So Colombo of ordinary Italian Americans, and he started in a way that [dramatic music] - In effect, he declared war on the FBI. So he began picketing FBI headquarters, which was then on the Upper East Side. [indistinct talking] - [Narrator] It was a picketing the very heart of law enforcement in New York. - He thought, if I claim that they're discriminating against me, I can either make them - [Narrator] Day after day, a crowd of demonstrators harassed and accused them of unduly who were legitimate businessmen. - Why the FBI? Why is the FBI, in your mind, persecuting the Italians? - He used all his underlings and we used to call them MOOKS, M-O-O-K-S, to stand out there and - Well, it's obvious could read in the paper. Every time you see something, is labeling Italian people belonging to an organization. The story first is the mafia. As far as we're concerned there is no such thing. It's a word that's been invented by the law enforcement agencies and we don't feel it's right. - [Narrator] The crowds grew Colombo reveled in it. - There's a conspiracy in this country against every Italian American. We've been saying this, we'll continue to say it, and it's only till it touches them. In Ward A, are they any better than you, I or anybody else standing in this crowd? - [Narrator] This unspoken was unheard of in mafia circles. It was in marked contrast to his silence at the grand jury years before. Mafia men, used to speaking in hush tones of the Cosa Nostra, were unsettled. - All my life, and if it - Why declare war on law enforcement? You're gonna have enough Why make it personal? [dramatic music] - [Narrator] The worry of the mafia was law enforcement because of Colombo's actions. But initially, for the FBI agents, it was a new unsettling tactic. The tables had been turned. - I know a lot of them There were some collisions where they almost came to blows. - Now I'll go a little further. Many of the other minority groups are starting to feel this thing. And when they get through to the next body of people. And this is where the and this is where the public of these things be brought out to light. And why are they so and why shouldn't there be [dramatic music] - [Narrator] In 1970, Colombo shifted his He created the Italian-American [people applauding] - Everybody wanted to be attached to it. Everybody, including the politicians, radio commentators, And then people started to realize, hey, the Italians contributed a lot and a lot they should be proud of. - [Narrator] The league, had huge success almost instantly, recruiting some 50,000 paid [lively music] - Now you see nationality flags. Well, Joe Colombo started it. It was the Italian flag being that was in Brooklyn, owned by an Italian, or a Lincoln owned by an Italian. Every car had an Italian flag on it. Everybody bought into it. [pensive music] - [Narrator] And Colombo's League achieved some notable early victories. They took their campaign of corporate America. Major brands like General Motors and Alka-Seltzer were targeted. Their ad campaigns were to Italian Americans. The league got them withdrawn. They also got a board game from Macy's department store. [film whirring] Even Hollywood felt the [pensive music] Producers of &quot;The Godfather&quot; movie started to have trouble filming in New York. Production was threatened by walkouts, obstructions and delays. The league came to the rescue, offering to smooth the process if the producers agreed to the mafia or Cosa [lively music] Lead captains then taught to sell the idea of the Finally, filming was allowed to continue uninterrupted on [pensive music] Colombo went further still. He even got the New and FBI to stop referring to the term mafia in its as it was prejudicial. The city was listening to Joe Colombo and the league was proving [lively music] In 1970, Colombo was ready its first Italian American Unity Day Rally to be held in Columbus Circle [lively music] Under the glare of news The city's traditionally were deserted. The other mob families reluctantly allowed to close for the day in solidarity. [dramatic music] - There was so much press and the streets were that were so proud of being Italian. And everybody wanted to get up on the day to be standing next to Joe Colombo when he spoke of national - [Joe] My fellow Americans... - [Narrator] Colombo held the stage and attacked the law - Say to the American... - [Narrator] It was a triumph for the Godfather turned activist. [people chanting indistinctly] In the wake of the rally, He appeared on TV chat shows - He gave press conferences The Daily News, The New York every newspaper wanted to hear from him. - [Narrator] Publicly, he continued to describe the mafia as a myth and promised to champion the - [Reporter] Is the Italian accomplishing the aims - Oh, definitely. - [Reporter] What has it - It has helped, not me It has helped people of all ethnic groups. It's helped children. It's It's helped anyone that needs help. It's made people feel and anybody who would want for it and they would have it. [dramatic music] - [Narrator] Up until had preserved an air of legality. However, under Colombo, this because he was still a mobster and the League was just another - American Civil Rights League to fight against discrimination. As far as that went, it wasn't a bad idea, but he was the wrong person to He was the wrong person to of the Italian American community. [dramatic music] - [Narrator] In fact, Colombo was hijacking a legitimate cause. [dramatic music] The league proved to be a money spinner. It was netting him plenty of funds that he could appropriate. - Joe Colombo formed the as a racket, as a scam And he used it for that purpose. He was shaking down store owners all over Italian neighborhoods, forcing them to put his It was an Italian flag with a one on and Italian-American And he actually was - A very wise state senator here who was an Italian American said, &quot;Don't be fooled by Colombo.&quot; [dramatic music] - [Narrator] Colombo wasn't by skimming off a legitimate cause, he was creating jealousy and and within his own family. [dramatic music] His old mentor, Carlo - And he was told by Carlo, &quot;Stop this. We don't want it.&quot; And no ands, ifs or buts was taken. If you continue, you're gonna pay a price. [pensive music] - [Narrator] But Colombo was oblivious to any looming danger. He thought he was untouchable, and a media darling. He wouldn't back down. 1971 was going to be his year. - And Colombo was an egotist. He figured he was bigger and better than the unit which was the mafia. [dramatic music] - [Narrator] Then there was more trouble. The FBI struck again. [people shouting indistinctly] Angered by Colombo's actions through the Italian-American they issued subpoenas for [dramatic music] In December 1970, he was arrested, along with one of his men, Rocco Miraglia. When police searched their car, they found a briefcase stuffed full of incriminating documents, detailing the various [dramatic music] but worse still, the names of Colombo was immediately called before a federal grand But then he did something [dramatic music] Rather than keeping his mouth shut, like he had the last time he adopted a different tactic and decided to talk his way out of it. He explained that the dollar amounts next to names were simply Carl, he explained, was none reputed mafia boss. The $30,000 next to his name was actually a donation to the League. [dramatic music] That was a bad move. You don't implicate the boss of bosses before a grand jury, especially The repercussions were immediate. [sirens ringing] That same year, the police and federal strike forces combed the city. [sirens ringing] Even Carlo Gambino paid the price. He was arrested in 1970. [dramatic music] It was clear that it was that had got him into deep trouble with his former protector - His behavior began to worry - This incensed the old mafioso. They didn't want that. They wanted to stay in the shadows, and Joe was bringing them out. - [Narrator] Joe Colombo's [dramatic music] [lively music] But despite the looming threat, with his tried and tested formula. He would roll out the He even booked Frank Sinatra for a fundraiser at Politicians joined the causee, including state Governor and he planned another for his ever-expanding league. This rally would seal his status and keep the forces of law [pensive music] But by now, his enemies An old adversary from his early days, his family boss, was waiting in the wings. Crazy Joe Gallo was watching events from prison with a critical eye. - Joey Gallo was called Crazy Joe, and there was a reason for that - I'll give you an example They had a club on President and in the basement, they had to intimidate victims, who owed the money or And if somebody didn't pay to the club on President to the basement, and down at the bottom of the stairs would be this you know, and they would [dramatic music] - [Narrator] Colombo He and his brothers, Larry and Albert, known as the Gallo clan, had once tried to take over the Colombo family. [dramatic music] In the 1960s, they led a bloody insurrection at President Street in Brooklyn until Joe Colombo brokered a peace deal with Larry and Albert Gallo while Crazy Joe was in jail. [pensive music] Now Crazy Joe was itching to - The bottom line is jealousy. Gallo wanted to be the boss of the family. Colombo was the boss of the family, and Gallo wanted to take him out. Simple as that. [dramatic music] - [Narrator] Gallo needed soldiers for the forthcoming showdown, and he had a novel idea behind bars, he had made with African American This was something no one in The two groups were traditionally enemies, but Gallo was ahead of his time. He saw that if the two they could be stronger. Then in February 1971, Crazy Joe Gallo, was released Publicly, he swore his and he renounced his criminal past. But privately, it was business as usual. He was back on the streets. In his eyes, the peace As far as he was concerned, and he was preparing for a counter attack. [pensive music] So it was that the stage was set for the second Italian in June 1971 at the same site New York's Columbus Circle. - They had a huge rally, and thousands of Italian Americans. This was Colombo's rally against the FBI and New and law enforcement in general. Now, we were distance away taking pictures and doing intelligence and observing who was there. [dramatic music] - [Narrator] However, The mafia bosses had to stay at work. The League was no longer tolerated. 40,000 fewer people turned out. - Attendance was down then at They passed the word that stores should not close [people chanting indistinctly] - [Narrator] Just before noon, Colombo headed to the podium to speak. He was preparing to launch on the FBI. An African American news cameraman with press credentials approached. As the journalist grabbed for a soundbite, the [gun shots] - I was there the day that up comes this gunman and Down he goes. [gun shots] - [Narrator] Then something [gun shots] - And the man that shot him was dead before he hit the floor. [gun shots] So there was actually two one to have Joe shot and one - [Narrator] Joe Colombo to hospital alive but comatose. Confusion reigned and supporters were at a loss to explain - You know, he was just down on the ground and there was blood on his right cheek. And you know what? It's incredible. You don't expect to see these things in the course of a covering a story. And the shots kept coming and I was standing like, you and I then I started to run and I heard somebody else I ran. - As far as I know, Joe in critical condition one in the chest and one in the head. We understand one of the - You know who did it? - I have no idea. I have no idea who did it. - Did you see it? - No, I did not see it. I was standing behind the - What's your reaction to this? - My reaction is right now, there's still a state of confusion as to what really transpired. I'm still trying to piece the [dramatic music] - [Narrator] The hit on by Jerome Johnson, an but he was a very unlikely killer. He was a drifter and petty criminal with a penchant for stalking girls on a nearby university campus. He had no record as a hitman for the mob. It was a curious discrepancy of detectives, Albert Seedman. [dramatic music] - Unfortunately, we have not been able to rule out one possibility or the other. Mr. Johnson is still some [pensive music] - [Narrator] What puzzled the police was someone must have told Johnson to undertake the hit and trained him. The question was who? The African American to Crazy Joe Gallo. [dramatic music] - [Reporter] More around town, you hear the gang land theory being pushed that Gallo did make a hit on Colombo. - This is merely conjecture and rumor, but there is no basis to any of it as far as we have been able to learn thus far. [dramatic music] - [Narrator] The simple truth was that other senior mafia because for over 50 years, no one could be killed of the mafia's governing Every family had a seat on The Commission. - If they had to kill to The Commission and The This would prevent wide-scale killing and trying to take over - [Narrator] Under its rules, no family head can be rubbed of the other Commission members. The idea was the head of on how decisions were taken. It was democracy, mafia style, - First place, you're of all the other bosses to kill a boss. That's just simple. Bosses can't allow bosses to be killed without the Otherwise, none of them are safe. - [Narrator] Many therefore concluded that Gambino had to be somewhere behind the hit and had - I don't think there was much or the Gallo camp when Joe [dramatic music] - [Narrator] But as so the Columbus Circle shootings, and attempt on Colombo's There was nothing to pin on Gambino. - We're saying that Johnson with the Carlo Gambino family, but we are not making a statement that that was his exclusive [dramatic music] - [Narrator] The one man was Crazy Joe Gallo. 11 months later, Crazy Joe was eating with his friends at a seafood restaurant to celebrate his 47th birthday. [gun shots] - They were sitting at a rear table, this group of six people, when a man walked in from the back door and he walked up to the side of the table and he fired three shots. He hit Joe twice and he hit his bodyguard, Pete the Greek, one time. - [Narrator] For the FBI the only explanation had to be Colombo family - He was killed by elements It was ordered by a guy named He was the capo in the Colombo family who ordered the hit. [dramatic music] - [Narrator] But if Colombo's to bring stability back to the mafia, it actually signaled the slow demise of the Colombo crime family because leaderless and at war, the family's fortunes turned It began to tear itself apart in the decades that followed. The internal power struggles never ended. The Colombo family is now just a shadow of its former self. In 2011, a further 125 of The family's power has collapsed for now. [pensive music] As for Joe Colombo, none of this mattered. He never recovered from He remained in a vegetative state and died eight years after being shot. - [Reporter] Funeral services of America's leading crime - If you look at his for shooting crap when Every other indictment, after he became a civil rights leader. And that was another indication on how the media particularly championed what law enforcement often gives them. Joe Colombo has left his [pensive music] - [Narrator] He died a maverick who had dared to do things differently. But by taking on mafia rules and fighting the FBI at the same time, it was a battle he could never win. - His picketing the FBI was kind of stupid. You're not exactly dealing with - [Narrator] Perhaps his biggest mistake was to find the world of civil than running a crime family. [people applauding] - For a while, he got away with it. People who should have known better joined his committees. He was using civil rights as a shield. In my opinion, he was the fool. - [Narrator] Fame would offer from a failure to obey the most fundamental mafia principles. - All Joe Colombo's troubles I mean, if he had followed particularly the mob bosses, and just operate your business and bring money in, he never But because he became flamboyant and he got got his ego swelled, he decided to go out into the public [dramatic music] - [Narrator] In any case, the high-profile Civil virtually disappeared overnight.
