[Renan] Hey everyone! [Renan] We rented a car here First, we're on the hunt They say the true Mount Sinai is here so we're going after it. They say it's better to go with a 4x4, Let's take this opportunity to show you They have the number written in Arabic, and below that, in our numerals We're about 20 km which is believed to be We're not sure how because part of it I think the peak The routes here aren't very clear It shows several paths. We're following this one [Michele] And just to add Saudi Arabia only opened up So it's still very hard For example, this road [Renan] Yeah, if you look there's barely anything, just a few that's why we were worried But at least now it's paved. This region is also part If you search you'll find it's this huge, So much is being built, and everywhere you go, [Michele] It's also possible, based on some information that parts of the road are blocked. Cars might not be allowed through, so we're just going and we'll see how far we can get. [Renan] It's been widely publicized, that they're building It's a massive structure, I imagine it won't be too hard in the middle of the desert. Instrumental Arabic music [Renan] Well, folks, we made it. We thought there would be more suspense but it was easy, [Michele] Theoretically, it's this one, [Renan] Just to give some context Mount Sinai is the mountain where Moses received instructions, and was given They arrived at Mount Sinai after spliting the sea So, if you look at a map, the official Mount Sinai and this one is in Saudi Arabia. So if you look, so it could be both. We've already been to the one in Egypt, That one is official, It's official because Emperor or rather, his mother did, and even built a chapel at the top. According to ancient tradition, The arguments for why this one is the one argument is that Moses climbed and that mountain so some say it doesn't make sense. I don't know if this argument holds, because I'm not sure where or what the Bible considered So I don't know how relevant Another argument the mountain caught fire. This peak is dark, so they say it makes more sense Another argument is that, in this region, there's a kind of pathway an easier path to cross. So if the sea truly parted, this path would have been passable. They say it would have been and everyone to cross. The police stopped by and said, "You can't stop here I told them, "I just want to take And they said, So here we are, but we'll move on [Michele] There they are. That was really nice of them! Renan went over to their car, and they said, And Renan: and they were like, "Okay, no problem." [Renan] Yeah, I thought Maybe they're concerned but I think it's more about safety He said, &quot;You can't stop on the road,&quot; Another argument match the biblical account, We're not sure if we can get We had to go off-road here, Hmm, I think we can't enter. [Michele] Oh, is this the place The map says it's right here: and here's where we are. [Renan] Yeah, this is the location. There's an open gate. Let's see if we can read Yeah, it says this is and it's illegal to enter. So, we're not going in; Too bad! According to the story, when Moses first went up Mount Sinai, and told the people: &quot;Don't worship other gods, Then he went back up Meanwhile, the people below got anxious Let's make a golden calf Supposedly, it was in this area. They say there are even that show people This is where Moses came down, &quot;I just told you not to do this, So he destroyed the golden calf, and the people said, Well, supposedly, [Michele] To help you visualize: and here's where the golden calf altar So, it makes sense. But once again, poor Moses! He had to keep going then he came here and saw So he had to leave again [Renan] They say when Moses with the tablets he saw the people and threw the tablets Then he had to make There are photos of this site online. I wish the police &quot;Go ahead and take a quick look.&quot; [Michele] Honestly, Everyone here is so kind and friendly, [Renan] Yeah, better for them Let's show you some images photos taken by others. I think people do enter here, though. There are plenty of photos But let's respect the rules. The story of Mount Sinai They say that the one who brought the people together, was Aaron, Moses' brother. Aaron told them, and any gold you have so we can melt it down [Michele] It's said Moses was so angry ground it into powder, and made everyone drink it. [Renan] We wandered around here They're on this rock over here. Let's zoom in with the phone to show you what we're seeing. Wow, it's so close! The gate is here, But they probably forbid access [Michele] People tend These days, you visit important sites, [Renan] Some people sneak in here; When the gate is closed, We climbed up a rock I can't quite make out Hopefully, we'll see them after transferring the photos Another point in favor is that there are multiple making it a good place It's also located beyond Midian. We're planning to head to Midian next but I believe they crossed [Michele] Let me show you again: here is where the golden calf and here's Mount Sinai. It's not far, but still, poor Moses [Renan] And watch out Since the journey to Midian is long, Let's see how challenging Oh, the guy here speaks English! [Michele] At least he knew [Renan] Yeah, he explained The plate works like this: and from what I understood, It always comes with Arabic bread. He also brought this sauce, Could the guy be from Pakistan? [Michele] Could be, right? They usually take pride when the restaurant serves food [Background chatter] [Michele] And to go with it, with three small peppers. Honey, appreciate this because, as we saw at the supermarket, So, when you get salad, [Renan] Alright, I thought it was 12 per person, I think the bread and salad Arabic music [Michele] Earlier, Renan mentioned that there's a Project and they're renovating everything. We're heading to a spot nearby, and we'll show you At the city's entrance, and put up these light posts, [Renan] We've arrived It's a small town, but it's believed According to the Bible, during a time when Pharaoh &quot;The Hebrew population it's becoming dangerous. Have all the children And so Moses was born His mother managed then placed him in a basket Pharaoh's daughter found the baby without knowing he was Hebrew. [Michele] And the name &quot;Moses&quot;, as in &quot;Moses basket&quot; for babies, comes from this story of Moses. [Renan] Yeah, from that little basket. One day in Egypt, Moses saw so he intervened Then he thought, I better flee before they catch me.&quot; And it's said he fled This is supposedly This is also an important place, and there's even a gap in the fence But anyway, there's a well over there. [Michele] Or there used to be. Some say [Renan] Maybe we can see it What's the story about this place? It's said that two sisters were giving when some shepherds Moses arrived, intervened, &quot;No, stop bothering the women, [Michele] In fact, Moses himself and gave it to the animals. The sisters were impressed. [Renan] Yeah, so they went &quot;There's this man who helped us.&quot; The father said, &quot;Oh, bring him Moses became friends who offered one of his daughters [Michele] And that's how Moses [Renan] It's said that he lived [Michele] They say he looked after while he lived here. Look at this whole complex. It starts down below, and there's a walkway But it's completely fenced off. [Renan] The Bible mentions he was out herding sheep but it wasn't being consumed He thought, &quot;How strange! There's a fire, When he got closer, and told him to return to Egypt That's when Moses went back This happened at a place Religious tradition holds are the same. We drove nearly 200 km but in a straight line, Still, it's quite far for him Some historians even suggest one's where he received and the other one is where But religious tradition claims [Michele] This would justify I'm not betting on one or the other, that this is the real one [Renan] Another piece of evidence. [Renan] Whenever we talk &quot;Historians claim this and that, The truth is, you can fully believe or not believe in God at all. What matters is that believed in these stories, So, whether the events happened historians try to decipher: &quot;The guy who wrote about this mount, It's like when we went to Greece The Greeks believed Whether gods lived there or not But the fact is that a society existed and they believed their gods lived These are the kinds of stories when studying biblical accounts. Now we're near another place that, according to this theory would have been the area the Hebrews Let's hope it's open, and we can show you Well, folks, the site is over there, A policeman told us He asked, From what I understand, Only workers are allowed through. We said, There are some wells there because... some time after they had the people stopped So there are these wells, But the officer said everything because of the construction work. If you look, our car seems to be one [Michele] Passenger vehicles. [Renan] Because it's mostly trucks, This entire area is under construction. Let's head to the construction hub Next to the city, The gate was open, There weren't any signs Those guys went in, Let's see. This might be And look how interesting! The city here with some things At Petra, we talked We don't know if this city is associated There are some plaques, but they didn't mention this history. They only state that this was If we follow Petra's example, these structures here There are more similar Here's a cave. This isn't a large site, but I imagine If only 20% of Petra this one must be just 1%. Let's climb up; there are some caves. Look here, this also looks like a tomb. There are more structures around. As we said, this is not so there's not much You don't find guides and there isn't even There are some tours, but most are for the local The guides speak Arabic, so... Well, tourism for Westerners here [Michele] According to Google Maps, and it says there's a museum nearby, When we arrived, they tried pushing the door, So, the museum is closed, and we couldn't even go inside [Renan] Those guys, we concluded because they're in uniforms. Anyway, look at this amazing For a long time, I thought the desert, was all just sand dunes. When I read that Moses wandered I thought, &quot;Poor guy, 40 years climbing these difficult dunes.&quot; But that's the impression movies give The desert is actually like this. In fact, places with dunes because they're rare. People go there, they slide down them, When this place becomes famous, it'll be another spot we can say [Michele] And it'll probably Then our cheapskate side will say, [Renan] Here's another cave. You just keep walking, This place is still Do you think Moses lived [Michele] So, the folks said that people from Moses' time We can't be sure because we didn't read Look here, everything The entire road in this area And by &quot;this area&quot;, I mean about [Renan] The area for these projects Many people... Well, we can show the project later. But many people have doubts, like, &quot;This is so huge, But at least they're working on it. Whether it will succeed, I don't know, [Michele] Let's try refueling Let's see how much gas costs here. [Renan] Look at the gas price here: In another video, we showed gas is more expensive, [Michele] And look, but we see here: wooden houses This one seems to be an office because it has a little spot And as you saw earlier, Here's a construction site; [Renan] We stopped here We thought of getting closer but there is no &quot;close&quot;, If you go another 50 km, trucks passing by They say about 100,000 workers in the Neom Project construction. Their goal is This Neom Project some kind of hotel, There's also a ski station as part of the project. But the most incredible project, is called The Line. The initial plan for The Line was for it to stretch 170 km end-to-end ...of pure construction. And it would be 170 km. 170 km of a single block According to their website, this massive structure is designed They estimate that if you lined up and then added another row, you'd get this project. The estimated cost is $1 trillion, Bloomberg, a magazine, reported they haven't raised so they scaled back the project, The original plan was already Still, even this smaller plan, "smaller&quot;, because it's 2.5-km version, is already a challenging construction. This reduced version is designed And according to Bloomberg, they're struggling to find They're traveling to other countries but people remain doubtful Many companies are also hesitant to associate their names because Saudi Arabia isn't exactly So, companies worry: and something happens It could damage my reputation." I think that's the main hurdle [Michele] We heard similar concerns People said many workers and there wasn't enough So, it's probably tricky for companies to attach their names to something [Renan] Yeah, they doubted Qatar too, but in their own way they pulled it off [Michele] I was Reading and it says this project is meant with progressive laws [Renan] Let's show you so you can see it. They're digging. There's already a trench and construction We need to come back here in 2030 [Michele] I also heard they want it'll have schools, hospitals, They claim that the basic needs will be met within And a super-fast vehicle will take 20 minutes We have to come back to see this. [Renan] Yeah, there are some things but let's see what actually The idea is for this place zero carbon emissions, And it's cool, But then critics say: "Okay, fine, even if this city how many resources If you take those resources, you could let these with their regular carbon emissions. But anyway, we don't know Now, one thing we have to say: we've seen construction work mobilizing so many people That's truly impressive. [Michele] Just so you get an idea not only do they keep passing by but when we tried there was a massive line [Renan] Alright then, folks, that's it. We made it back at night The rental cost 300 . Actually, the rental itself was 200 , but we had to pay an extra 100 Here, gas is cheap, so you can't take full advantage. Renting the car was super easy I thought it would be more Very normal. Just book online, Now we're waiting Uber works well here too. And that's it, folks. In this video, we missed a few places We didn't expect it But we got to explore That's it then. [Michele] Just to wrap it up, I think Saudi Arabia at least in this region, by 2030. Until then, it'll be a bit rough. Bye! Soft music
