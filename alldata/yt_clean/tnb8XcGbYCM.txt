If you've ever watched you've likely wondered if Baseball pitch. [INAUDIBLE] He's at the wall. And the legend grows! [INAUDIBLE] Gone! Let's break it down. According to athletes hitting a baseball is the The distance from the is 60 feet 6 inches. At 96 miles per hour, the in less than half a second. That's about the same amount So in the blink of an eye, the decide whether to swing the sweet spot of the bat If the batter is too or if the ball hits the wrong Strike 3. There is no room for error. So can Ty actually get a hit? We're about to find out. Time to go get the first This is going to tell us a lot. Cody actually had once he got Tyler likes how we so we can get an eye on it, I'm the guinea pig today, [GRUNTS] Woo! It's different Whoa! Yeah! Woo hoo! Have yourself a day! Yeah! We've worked our way up. Now, this is the first look So let's see what happens. Start at 70 miles an Starting off at 70 miles We'd seen the speed before. The wood bat is obviously For those that don't you can use up through college. They have a lot more pop, a MLB guys got to use wood bats. Certainly makes a difference. Wow! Good ball, kid. Got some good hits, So you realize what Went up to 80 miles an hour. Still got some good Granted, it's coming out It's coming straight at you. You know what to expect. [MUSIC PLAYING] Much better. That was a much better cut. Yeah! There you go. That'll do, donkey! Yeah, I think we can How fast are you Probably going to be around 92, League hitter would see. And how fast does Leclerc throw? 96, 97. You're going to use the or the pitcher-- To create the power. --to create the distance. Yeah. Just put barrel on ball. It's going to go. OK. A nice, smooth swing. Just staying back. OK. You're good. All right. Let's try it. Oh! Got to stay back. Call me crazy. I think he touches it tomorrow. You're crazy. It might be fouled It might be hit directly in Dude, no chance. Yeah, kid! Hey, atta boy! He's starting to figure Looking good. Yeah, good swing. Looking more optimistic now for Oh. Atta boy. Ah! How do you feel after that, T? Live pitching is just But you know what? Put some barrels Can't be mad about that. Just got to swing the bat. Can't go down looking. That's the name of Get your cuts in, and don't Regardless, it's an And you can't beat it. And I broke a bat over my which was sick.
