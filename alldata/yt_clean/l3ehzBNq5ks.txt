Take one. You are still on about this? Auntie, you're drying fishing nets! The bandits are here! Brothers! Let's go! Before the Eastern Expeditions, in Chaoshan, the government is corrupted and useless, bullies are rampant, bandits wreck havoc in villages, the people are struggling to just live. The legend has it, only Mazu's supreme power can eliminate all disasters. The jade statue of Mazu is coveted by all kinds of people. Before anyone knew it, swords fly, clouds move. Hurry! [The Legend of Mazu] [Adopted From Zheng Zhonghai Novel &quot;Chaoshan Yanyu&quot; Chapter] Auntie, Mei! You're here! Auntie, Mei, the fish jerky is ready, check it out. Great. This smells good! Hey, old man. That's quite a lot of fish. Thanks to God. Nonsense, thanks to Mazu. We have to taste it, it's the rules. Of course. Go to the scale. Come on, hurry up! Get in line. Follow up! 7.5 kilograms. This is 10 kilograms, what are you talking about? How could you say that? Where did all this nonsense come from? I said it's 10 kilograms, it's 10 kilograms. Piss off. You idiot. All these people are back with a ship full of fish, what about you? Shrimps? Useless shit. What are we gonna eat? What? I didn't want to. You've got some balls. Stop bullying people! So what? I do what I want. You are taking advantage of us! You can't even let us poor fishermen go! How is that fair? Fair? I decide what's fair! Get 'em! Guo Xiaomei, you! Well done, Mei! Please forgive us, Master Tian, this is all my fault! Guo Xiaomei. Guo Xiaomei of the Guo Family from Ferry Village. Finally, we could meet. Here, milord. Have some porridge. Okay. Do you like it? Of course. Here. You bad girl. Milord. It's okay. Hmmm. All the money in the world can't beat three meals a day. I have these, and you guys. I am more than satisfied. Greetings to the mayor. Hmmm. Oh. I have some business to discuss. Give us a minute. Yes, milord. These days, even meat is too expensive. Look at my belly. I've gotten thin! Have at it, Mr Mayor. Oh! These little yellow fish are much better than meat. Bad things happen. But we don't always tell them to people. Mr Mayor, are you still worrying about your 8th concubine? You do know me. There is this Guo Xiaomei from Ferry Village. She's got a pretty face. Why don't you take her? Do you have any plans, Master Tian? Leave it to me. Really? Real as those gold. Great. As long as you get it done, I assure you a position as the Captain of the village. Thank you so much, Mr Mayor. But that Guo Xiaomei is not an easy piece of cake. I'm afraid she won't come along quietly. It's gonna cause you some trouble. Come on, as long as you get it done, no matter how much trouble she causes, she will quiet down in my palms. I'll get right to it. Get ready to eat. Okay. Hey! Stop practicing, dinner time. Let's stop, go eat something. Here you are. Let me, watch out. Slow down. Come on, have at it. Have a seat, mom. This is a lot! It's like New Year's Eve! We fishermen, our job depends on destiny. We owe everything to Mazu. She looks out for your safety. You will capture more and more fish on your trips. Thank you, auntie. I am the one who should thank you. You see, ever since Mei came back from Thean Hou Temple, she's been a bit of a pill. You took care of her. Auntie, don't say that. You don't know how much Ci and I admire Sister Mei. Not only us, all the people in this village admire her. Yes, right. If she's around, those bullies wouldn't dare to pick on us. She's just like Brother Guo back in the day. Hey! Our Dahai, what good will his kung-fu do? He offended the Fishing Tyrant, Huang Tianzong. He was forced onto Mount Dasang. We haven't heard from him since. Her dad died out of nowhere. Say, if anything should happen to Mei... Mom! I'll be okay! Yes, auntie, Mazu will protect Sister Mei. Longer, have some tea. It's been ten years. You weren't even eighteen then. Guo Dahai. You are the reason why my son couldn't be in Huang Family's ancestral hall. Ten years later, Guo Xiaomei is going against me just because she inherited the jade statue of Mazu. I, Huang Tianzong, will be Guo Family's swore enemy. Sister Mei, Sister Mei! The bandits are here again? The fishing boats at sandbank are on fire! Hurry, put it out! Hurry! Hurry up! Fire! Hurry! Why? Master Tian. How was it? It's done. Okay. Uncle Shrimp, Uncle Shrimp! Uncle Shrimp! Uncle Shrimp, Uncle Shrimp! Change this. Doctor Cai, how's my mom? Her condition is most peculiar. I have never seen anything like this during my years as a doctor. Master Lin, my deepest apologies for my lack of capability. You're gonna find someone else. You are living Hua Tuo, a miracle doctor who could saved the world. Even you couldn't do anything about it? I'm afraid milady's illness could not be cured by just any medicine. A living Hua Tuo? Looks like a snake oil salesman to me. I am so very sorry. Master Lin, Mrs Lin, I'll be going now. Granduncle. Shun. Yes, Master. You need to find Yidao Immortal at the Sanqing Taoist Temple. Right now. Yes, master. Milord, do you think this is the right time to invite Yidao Immortal? Yeah! We have to put our faith in both men and gods. Immortal. You Immortal, you sure are hard to find. Please. Master, the Immortal is here. Blessed infinite heaven. Immortal, you are finally here. I did not expect this to happen so fast. Well... Master Lin, sidebar, please. Yes, please. Please. There will be a inexorable doom in every sixty-year cycle for Lin's Stone House. Mrs Lin getting down in a coma for no reason is a sign of this doom. The Stone House and the Sanqing Taoist Temple has been friends for years. Your Master, Yunshui Immortal was an old friend of our family. Is there any way for the Lin family to get out of this doom? If you wanted to change fate, the key is your son. He has to marry someone with exceptional fate decided by her date of birth. This way, the wedding could break you out of the doom, change your fate. Great. I'll listen to you. It's time for Yi to get married and have kids for this family anyway. Hey, Taozai. I was discussing important business with the Immortal. Don't interrupt us, give us a minute. I can handle this wedding business! I haven't even gotten married now. How could my brother's grandson get married before me? If words got out, I will be the laughing stock of this town. Shun. Taozai, stop calling people! Master. Please show uncle out. What are you doing? You damned kid! How dare you to be disrespectful to me? I'll chew you up! Granduncle (calls as her son's family hierarchy). Look at you, all immature. In what world could my brother's grandson get married before me? I'm leaving. Shun. Yes, master. Go invite Auntie Xiao here. The Ironclad Matchmaker. Yes. Your grandmother is so sick. How could you listen to plays now? Hello? Did you hear me? My dad invited Yidao Immortal to show his filial respect. I invited opera singers to perform to show my filial respect to my grandmother as well. Why do you think Yidao Immortal is here? He wants you to get married! What? He wants you to get married! Your dad said yes. Why did that old man want me to get married? My grandmother said I could have more fun these years! Granduncle, you were there! I am much more anxious than you. What the hell is that Yidao Immortal doing? I have to remain calm. Think! Think! Hey! Where are you going? I have to play a few more rounds before my dad gets here. You don't have time for that now! I know my dad is forcing me to get married. I couldn't just stay put! Yi. How you take me to have some fun as well? Keep on doing that. Yi, Yi! Hey, Master Shun! Auntie Xiao, just the one I was looking for. My master wants to see you. Master Lin wants to see me? Yes, please, this way. Sure. Auntie Xiao, I invited you here today to matchmaking for my son, Yi. Happy to, happy to. There will be lots of rewards for you if you got it done properly. You flatter me. It is my extreme pleasure to be able to matchmake for your family. Besides, in Hanjiang City, everybody knows that the Lin Family is one of the biggest families around here. Not one lady wouldn't want to be married into your family. Great. Auntie Xiao. Please find the girl according this date of birth. Her date of birth has to match this. Rest assured, master. Consider it done! Mom, the Yidao Immortal pointed a way out of this doom. I have entrusted Auntie Xiao to matchmake for Yi to pray for you. To clear this disaster for you. I hope you can get better soon. Our fishing boats burnt down by that fire. Those are the livelihood of us fishermen. Mazu, please. Help us. Mom. Don't be sad, it'll be okay. Sister Mei, Sister Mei! What happened? It's bad! The villagers... Please just go! Granny. You can't eat that. Stop. Please save my daughter. Auntie. It'll get better. It'll get better. Please save my daughter. It'll get better. God, please save my daughter. The fishing boats are the livelihood of us fishermen. If we don't have boats, we could starve to death. If that's our only option, we might as well go begging for mercy from the Fishing Tyrant. We could borrow money and boats from him. What? Huang Tianzong? Yeah. We are young, we are not afraid of anything. But what about the kids and old people? What are you talking about? We would sooner starve or get sick rather than begging Huang Tianzong. That's right, those Fishing Tyrants are viscous. They won't care if we live or die. Sister Mei, please figure something out for us. Yes, please, Sister Mei. Three cups of tea complete heaven, earth, and man. All the taste of life is in these cups. Master Tian, Guo Xiaomei asked to meet you. Sister Mei. We've been waiting forever, he hasn't even opened the door yet. He's obviously trying to embarrass us. Let's just go. Yeah, sister Mei. He knows we are here to beg him. He must be figuring out ways to humiliate us, we better go now. We are fishermen, we are used to a little set backs. As long as we calm ourselves, improvise, there's nothing we can't handle. How long have they been waiting? Quite long. Over two hours. Finished porridge are better when left cool down. Understood. Go, let her in. Yes. Great barkers are no biters. Ci, Langxian, don't worry. Just wait for me at the door. Master Tian, Guo Xiaomei is here. Hmmm. The Huang Residence is no church. I am no charitable folk. If you want to borrow money and boats, there will be a price. Name your price. You Guos sure are straightforward. Then I'll be straight. Mayor Wang has his eyes on you. He wants you to be his 8th concubine. You...! I normally don't waste good stuff like this. As long as you hand over the jade statue of Mazu to me, money and boats are no problem. The jade statue of Mazu? Let me be honest with you. You inherited the jade statue of Mazu. Everybody in Hanjiang City knows that. You won't leave that easy. Step out of the way. Go get someone. Don't move. If you move a step, I'll shoot you. Stop. I'll let you live, for Mazu's sake. You wanna be a hero to save your fellow villagers? Either you can be Mayor Wang's 8th concubine, or you can hand over the jade statue of Mazu to me. Or, you would all die. Are you okay? I'm fine. Thank you, everybody, let's go. Come on. Hurry. Let's go! Master, I am so sorry. I couldn't do what you wanted. I've looked through the Hanjiang City, inside and out, there's no right daughter-in-law for you. I... I... You can stop my business! Auntie Xiao, please get up. We know you tried your best. We won't blame you. Get up, please. This doom of our Lin Family, is there really no way out? Master, I know a place. But... Where? The Ferry Village. Auntie Xiao! Are you out of your mind? That village is a fishermen's village. How on earth would you even consider that? Master, we can't marry a fishermen's family, it's the rules. She's not good enough for the Lin Family. If the Lin Family married a fishermen's daughter, we would be the laughing stock of Hanjiang City. Let alone it's our son's marriage. Blessed infinite heaven. Mrs Lin. That's not entirely right. The divination has shown that if you want to succeed, you have to face obstacles. The heavenly power is on your side, you will have an opportunity. Where is this opportunity? Just like Auntie Xiao has said. The Ferry Village. Master Miaoxian entrusted the jade statue of Mazu to Guo Xiaomei. She is from the Ferry Village. The divine power of the jade statue of Mazu is not to be overlooked. If you could have that, the Lin Family will solve any obstacles that are coming your way. If this family could marry Guo Xiaomei, not only the wedding could break out the doom, it could change Lin Family's fate. But... But we are not the same kind of people, milord! Auntie Xiao. Please go find Guo Xiaomei and ask for her consent. Oh. Auntie Xiao, just go. Do what he says. Yes, I'll be going now. You can leave now as well. Immortal. Please choose a date for us to marry Guo Xiaomei. Master Lin. Huang Tianzong and Guo Xiaomei are swore enemies. Besides, Huang Tianzong knows that Guo Xiaomei inherited the jade statue of Mazu. He, too, coveted the jade statue of Mazu. That's why this marriage must happen as soon as possible, lest something unfortunate happens. How's it going at Guo Xiaomei's? Just as you have suspected, it's a dead end. Even with Mazu's power, she's doomed. You are the only one who could save them. Remember, be careful. You have to watch Guo Xiaomei and the Ferry Village very closely. We will not stop until we get the the jade statue of Mazu. [Daying Casino] Is that right? Is that right? Again, again! Am I right or not? Cai, Wang. Master. Where is the young master? Talk! The young master, he's... he ran away! Go get Shun, have him catch that bastard back! Hurry, go! Yes, master. Give me your money. Are you buying in? I couldn't possibly lose every time. You see? You lost again! Do you know...? Piss off! How dare you to hit me? Just wait right there! Bah! You think you're so great? Are you okay, young master? Come on. So pretty! Step aside. I didn't expect a fishermen's daughter could be this pretty. Rare. Watch your foot. Master Bao. Isn't that Lin Mingyi? Should we help him? Are you blind? Didn't you see Guo Xiaomei there? Granduncle, anytime now. Master Bao, she left. I am a man, I won't fight you! Let's go see if we can get anything out of Lin Mingyi. Yes, master Bao. Step away! Step aside. Master Bao, master Bao, what a treat! Please help your brother. Go take care of that fishermen's daughter, kill her! Young master Lin. You are a decent man. Let's not take those tiny people seriously, okay? Come, let me buy you a drink. Let's go calm our nerves. This is not a lucky day for me. Stay away from me. Leave. That fishermen's daughter had the audacity to shame on the street. How could I not get mad? Yes, right. She's pretty, just let her have her way. You can shame her back the next time. That's right! Do you have a death wish, barging in like this? Er. Shun. We all know each other pretty well. Let's not get ugly. Young master, master wants to see you. Leave. Young master, master wants to see you. Did you not hear me? You are just a servant. What if I don't come with you? I'll tie you up, according to master's orders. Who would dare to? Master Bao, this is family business. You might not want get into this. Shun, I'm ordering you as an elderly of the Lin Family. Release Yi now. I only answer to master, take him away. What are you doing? Unhand me! Unhand me! Dad, let me go! You two, don't leave for a second. If he gets away again, it will be your fault. Yes, master. Dad, dad! You two, just you wait. Mrs Guo, Mrs Guo. Hey, Mrs Guo. Congratulations! When I was heading here, the magpies won't stop chirping. Straight to your doorstep. Can I help you? Of course, great news! I am here to matchmake for your daughter! Mei? Yes, Guo Xiaomei! She will be marrying the largest family of Hanjiang City, the Stone House. The patriarch is the esteemed master Lin, Lin Taozai. The Lin Family? That's so out of our league! That's not right! Young master Lin is a perfect gentleman. Fishermen don't marry into the city. There are no rules for that. Those were old news. This is the Republic of China. We've already gotten rid of those old rules. Auntie Xiao, we appreciate the effort. Go fine someone else. Please, go fine someone else. Uncle Shan. You are good people. This is fate. One often delivers rice. One often delivers fish. You are right on time. This is your destiny. You are not allowed to go out with a fishermen's daughter. Fishermen are of low status. We Cai Family are different! We can not marry women like that! Dad, this country has been the Republic of China for a long time. The Republic of China? It's only a title. This country has not changed. Status won't change. And you can't change it. Dad, you...! You are not being reasonable! Mei, I wasn't trying to meddle. But we are of different status. It's the rules of our ancestors. You are close with young master Cai. If the villagers find out about it, it's won't be good for the both of you. Your father and your brother are gone. It's only the two of us. If anything happens to you, how will I live on? Mom. I got it. I will listen to you. Mrs Guo, Mrs Guo. Why are you still here, Auntie Xiao? Come on, Mrs Guo. If you don't think about yourself, you have to think about Mei's future. We are fishermen, generations for generations. I thank you, Auntie Xiao. But we cannot marry. Mom. I'll do it. Hey. Mei, you are a fine young lady. Mei. Mom, relax. I know what I am doing. Auntie Xiao. Yes. I have one request before marrying into Lin Family. What is it? I want Lin Family donate money for the Ferry Village to build boats. You are gonna be their family. Of course they will agree to that request. I'll go talk to master Lin now. Auntie Xiao! Thank you, Auntie Xiao. All in a day's work, it's no trouble. Auntie Xiao! Mom. If I could really marry into the Lin Family, Huang Tianzong can't have my jade statue of Mazu. And he won't be able to bully our villagers. Auntie Xiao, how's it going? Master Lin, you are a very lucky man. Guo Xiaomei has agreed to marry young master Lin. But, they want you to donate money to the Ferry Village for them to build boats. Oh, that makes sense. If the Ferry Village is in good hands, Guo Xiaomei will happily marry into my family. Auntie Xiao, I'll agree to her request. Thank you, thank you so much. Open it, open it! Master Pin, master said we can't open this door. You don't know who I am? I don't care who you are. Master said we can't open this door. You don't even listen to me? Do you have a death wish? How about you? You? Granduncle, Granduncle. Figure something out! I may be an elderly in this family, but I wouldn't dare to go against your dad. Granduncle, if I get married, not only will you lose face, we won't be able to have any fun anymore. How about we ask master Bao, see if he could do anything? Master Bao? Great, ask master Bao for help! I don't care about how much it costs me, this wedding has to be stopped. Or my life will be over! Don't worry, I'm going now. Great. Hurry up! Milord, this tea is divine. Mr Mayor, it's an emergency. Okay, give us a minute. Speak. Lin Taozai of the Stone House has asked Auntie Xiao to matchmake Guo Xiaomei to his family. We have to act fast, or your 8th concubine will be others. What? Go. Fetch Auntie Xiao for me. Yes. Hey! What? Don't move. What are you doing? We are capturing you. Don't make any sounds if you know any better. Or I'm gonna kill you. Come on! The Ironclad Matchmaker. We meet again. Hello, Mr Mayor, master Tian. Let's see how you behave. You are the matchmaker for three of my concubines for me. Why don't you do more? How dare you giving my 8th concubine to others? No! I wouldn't dare to, Mr Mayor! That young lady you were talking about, is her name...? She's Guo Xiaomei of the Ferry Village. Guo Xiaomei? If you don't say yes, you won't be able to say anything. Of course. That's sounds about right. Remember, don't tell anyone. Especially master Lin of the Stone House. Shoo. Yes, I'll be going. I'll be going. Master Tian. Go follow her. If she tries anything else, finish it. Understand. Are you overthinking this, master Tian? That Auntie Xiao looks like a smart person. Mr Mayor, you can never be too careful. We are going up against Lin Taozai. She's heading towards the Stone House. She's going to snitch, go capture her. Yes, master Bao. Where is she? You idiot, you can't even follow a woman! Master, other than Yi marrying Guo Xiaomei, is there anything else we can do? Who do you think she is? She inherited the jade statue of Mazu. If we could marry her, it's like the jade statue of Mazu is in our hands. Will it cure mom's disease? Oh. Master. What is it? Master, Auntie Xiao is here. Invite her in. Yes. Master Lin, Mrs Lin! Auntie Xiao, what's the hurry? Huang Tianzong forced me to matchmake Mayor Wang and Guo Xiaomei together. If I didn't run fast enough, I won't be seeing you guys now. The most peculiar! Cai Zhenhuan is quiet now, but that Mayor Wang is causing me trouble now. Auntie Xiao, you just do your job, I'll take care of Mayor Wang. Yes, master. Shun, come with me. Yes. Master Lin, to what do I owe this pleasure of you visiting me in the middle of the night? Please, I wouldn't dare to disturb you, Mayor Wang. Please have a seat, Master Lin. You are the most gracious. We go way back. The reason I'm bothering you now is that my son, Yi, is getting married soon. So I've come to invite you to the wedding. Oh? The young master is getting married? It's a good thing! I guess congratulations are in order. Which young lady is luck enough to be married into the Lin Family? The Guo Family of the Ferry Village. A fishermen's family? But that's against the rules! The Lin Family is much to big for this kind of marriage. I had the Yidao Immortal to perform a test, she's just to my liking. We've already set a date. What a coincidence! I remember I had Auntie Xiao matchmake for me with a Guo. What is her name? Guo Xiaomei, Yi is marrying Guo Xiaomei of the Ferry Village. Yi's marriage is the most important thing to our family. I've sent troops to invite my brother, Taojian. You have to be at the wedding, Mayor. Oh. Master Lin upstate is also coming? Then I have to greet him at the gate! We are all families here, you have to play fair. Don't worry, master Lin. I know what to do. Thank you, Mayor. It's late now, we'll be going. Take care. Shun, please take care of Master Lin. Is there anything else, master Lin? The Buddha pressed Monkey King under his palm, yet still let him live. Do you know why? Because the Buddha has mercy, he left room for living. Please tell Huang Tianzong, the wages of sin is death. Master Tian, what happened? That slimy bastard with no balls, a couple words from Lin Taozai and he's scared to his death! He told me that I have back down from Guo Xiaomei. What a coward. Don't be mad, master Tian. I have something to tell you. Maybe it could be a chance. Talk. Lin Mingyi had Lin Niangpin to find me. He wants me to put a stop to his marriage with Guo Xiaomei. God helps me. Master. Speak. I heard from Mayor Wang's housekeeper, Aliu, that Lin Taozai went to see Mayor Wang. It seems that marrying Guo Xiaomei is happening. Master, why did Mayor Wang... If we can't watch them fight, then we'll have to figure out another way. Lin Taozai cannot have his way again. Master Cai. Master Cai. I will do this deed for you. Lin Taozai cannot have all the advantages. This is not fair! I am not a bigger man like you, master Cai. I have to see this through. How do you propose you do that? Lin Mingyi is thinking about stopping this marriage. He found Bao to ask for help. I figure I could naturally hire the bandits of Yiqi Gang at Mount Dasang. We could stage the kidnapping of the bride as a mugging. Please show him out. Master Cai, wha...? Please show him out. Wha...? Master Tian, please. Housekeeper. Master. That idiot, Cai. Normally, he would be happy to cause troubles for Lin Taozai. Now he's a gentleman? Disgusting! Master Tian, master Tian, please wait. Mr Li, how can I help you? Master Tian, I, Li Fugui, has always admired you. This is a little something for your trouble. It's... If you want to do something, you have to have the resources. Is this Master Cai...? Somethings are better left unsaid. See you later, Mr Li. See you later, Master Tian. Yi, Yi! Granduncle, how's it going? Yi, master Bao said that you have to work with the bandits. You need to work from the inside to ruin the wedding. This is a great idea, so fun! Most importantly, it will shame my dad! Okay, I'll be leaving now. Granduncle, my freedom depends on you! Don't worry! Mom. This is all my fault that you are suffering. I've arranged the business with the wedding. I hope you will be okay. Mei. We've got the jade statue of Mazu. If we use it, we could get through this. My master once said that the jade statue of Mazu is only a symbol, it effect the people to seek good, be kind. We can't always depend on it. Only are we kind when using it, that the result will be good. Oh, is that so. Auntie Xiao, it's almost time. Yeah. Mei. Once you are married to the Lin Family, you are the newest member of that family. You have to be careful about everything. You have to be kind to your in-laws. You need to be respectful to your husband and younger members of the family. Once you chose this road, you are forever a member of their family. There's no room for making mistakes. Mom. I got it, I know. Mrs Guo, it's almost time. Okay. Sister Mei, the villagers are here to send you off. Okay, I'll be on my way. Lift! Sister Mei is the most honorable, her red dress are the most beautiful. She is the backbone of us fishermen. She is the helper of this village. She helped us when we were in peril. Sister Mei is the most honorable, her red dress are the most beautiful. She is the backbone of us fishermen. Hey, could you be careful? Under no circumstances should the carriage fall on the ground. The worst thing could happen if you broke these rules. We cannot afford even with our lives. Auntie Xiao, we know about these rules. This carriage won't fall onto the ground even it it kills me, relax. The carriage on the floor, all harm no good. Everybody be careful, nothing could go wrong. Lift. Protect the carriage! We are passing this road on our way to a wedding. Please let us go through and make this wedding happen. Please, gracious masters. It will be most gracious of you. Put down the carriage, I need some snack. By the way, I could have some fun. No, please! This is Lin Family's wedding! I don't care about that crap, I do whatever I want. You...! Guys, come on! Guys! This carriage must not fall onto the floor. It will break the old rules. Shut up! All I know is that, the bride is not getting off, and it's pissing Master Tian off! There are a lot of ghosts on this road, this piece of meat is not enough. Put down the carriage. The carriage on the floor, all harm no good. I especially like tough cookies like you. Come on, let's go! Take him away! Uncle. I thought you said your date of birth are no fit to the bride, you can't be at the wedding. What are you doing here? Master, master. Taozai! Master Tian, it's done! The wedding is off! Great! Kidnapping? What happened? What happened to the young master? Talk! He... He... Didn't I tell you? You shouldn't have sent Yi! He's not a big figure like me! He's no fit to situations like this. Besides... Granduncle, please. Master, master. Shun, what happened? Master, we ran into some bandits who wanted to kidnap the bride. The young mistress is okay. Shun, where is the young master? Taozai, Taozai! Granduncle (calls as her son), just say what you needed to say. You all think I am some kind of enemy. Let me tell you, the real enemy is here! The bride is in our hands, be prepared. The Yiqi Gang. Master, they wanted to kidnap the bride! What about Yi? Will he be okay? Don't scare yourself. Taozai, are you really my nephew? It's obvious that Yi was kidnapped by the Yiqi Gang. Kidnapped? Yi! Mom! Auntie Xiao, why don't you stay here? Sis, I know the wedding hasn't happened yet. But you stepped into the Stone House, that means you are now a member of this family. No one wants this to happen. Don't worry so much, my father will sort this out. You must be tired, have some rest. I'm sorry about all this. The young master of the Lin Family is forced to marry a lowly fishermen's daughter. Not only could I not stand this, even the gods are on my side. Granduncle. If you keep talking, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Okay, fine, I'll stop. I told you so. Taozai, Taozai. I know you planed this whole thing. If anything were to happen to Yi, you'll be hearing from me! Master, I beg you. You have to save Yi. If anything happens to him, I won't be able to leave. Mom, he'll be okay, he'll be fine. Milady, don't worry, he'll be okay. Blessed infinite heaven. Immortal, please save Yi! This happened because of the doom, you cannot escape it. Stop with that cryptic stuff! Granduncle. Immortal. Do you have any ideas? If it happens out of fate, it's nothing. But it happened because of people, there's no way around it. Yi. Okay, I'll bring people to Mount Dasang to make the exchange. Master, I'll go. Immortal, what should we do? Since when do you have a place here? Taozai. I recommend myself. I'll go. Granduncle, we are discussing important business here! I always listen to you. This time, listen to me. Let me finish. Taozai, families. You need an important person to negotiate with the bandits. Or we will lose face. Yi has always been close to me. This is the time for me to step up! Master, he makes some sense. How about we let him do it? Mom. He's always easily terrified. He cannot shoulder a huge responsibility like this! I think it should be Shun. Master. Master Lin, let me go there. I know the wedding isn't yet official, but it is a legit marriage. The carriage was inside the Stone House, so I am a member of this family. Now, my husband is in trouble, I have to help him. It is my responsibility to sort this out for my family. Master Lin, I have ways to save young master. Blessed infinite heaven. Let whoever tied the bell on the tiger take it off. Come in, please. Daughter. Mrs Lin. You are a member of this family now. You don't have to call me that now. Come, sit, daughter. We are deeply thankful of you offering to save Yi. You are so brave and kind. This is what I should do as his wife, as your daughter. I don't feel okay about letting Guo Xiaomei going to that mountain alone. I'll have Shun to follow her in the shadows. Just in case. The divination has shown that this trip will be dangerous but safe. Besides, there are two gangs on Mount Dasang. One of those gangs, Daxing Gang, has bit of a history with Guo Xiaomei. If you wanna know if she is the fortunate person, if she could break out the doom for the Lin Family, you could find out in this trip. Okay, okay. Break out! A bolt from the blue. Brothers of the four seas return. What vine? Tiger-head vine. You are one of our own. Why did you come up the mountain, lady? I am here to visit the Captain, Renmingsang, who am I speaking to? I am the 6th in charge, Zuantianlong. Then, could I have the pleasure of you showing me the way? Of course, but according to the rules, whoever came up the mountain must be hooded. Okay. Let's go. Mister? Don't go! Let's go, that way! Don't move or I'll shoot! Hey, Xiaomei! Brother Erhei! What are you doing here? I need a favor from the Captain. Let's go up the mountain. Let's go. Mei. I taught you the secret code words of our gang. I almost hurt you. Don't start. I ran into a group of people. The codes matched. But it turns out...! Was he claiming to be 6th in charge? Hey! That son of a bitch! He's been doing bad things under our name. Master Hei! Please, Xiaomei. How are the guys here? We are fine. A little banged up. Xiaomei! Sister Jianmeng! Mei, why are you here? You've gotten so pretty these years! So are you! You are so much prettier that before! Hey, captain! Look who it is! Hey, Xiaomei! Captain. It really is you, Xiaomei. You are such a fine lady now. You've grown up now, Xiaomei. Of course I did. But you still look good as you have always been, captain. You are so sweet. Yeah, she's so sweet. Xiaomei, how did you find the time to go up here? Yeah, it's been a really long time. What happened? Captain. Let's not stand here. Let's talk inside. Come on, Mei. Brother, captain. Let's stick to the plan. Okay. Watch out, Xiaomei. Sure. Who are you? Guo Xiaomei. Stop right there! Or I'll shoot you! Take her away! Captain, you did good. Come on. Captain. This lady came to us Yiqi gang all by herself. Tie her up and put her in the cell, calm her down. Yes, captain. Let's go. Get in. If I didn't have anything to do today, I'll be doing you now. Hmmm. Young master, young master. It's you! So you are... Lin Mingyi! So this could happen to you as well. You so deserve this. Hey. How did you know my name? Of course she knows. Master Tian! You are finally here! What is happening here? I thought we said the kidnapping would be fake, what's with all this? You...! Huang Tianzong! God Is watching everything you do. Aren't you afraid of karma? Guo Xiaomei, I admire you. Where did you find the confidence and courage? You are now meat in a platter. And you are still talking back? Do you want to save your damned husband? Give me your jade statue of Mazu. I, I am your husband? Idiot. Huang Tianzong, this is between you and me. Let him go. Sure, I could do that. Tomorrow at this time, if you don't give me the jade statue of Mazu, I'll kill him. Master Tian, please! So you wanted money, I have money! I'll let my dad pay you! Idiot. You wouldn't know. Somethings are much more expensive than money. Master Tian, master Tian. It's over. I was just messing around. I didn't expect this to be so serious. Lin Mingyi! Captain. I want to make an exchange for those two in the cell. Master Tian. I'm afraid it's against the rules. I am the one who gave you the news about Daxing Gang came down the mountain to smash those kilns. I could take some credit for that. I like the way you ask for things. Sure, master Tian. I agree. Thank you, captain. Hey, master Tian, just out of curiosity, why do you care about those two? I'm just doing someone else's bidding. Captain, Xiaomei did it! Guys, let's go! Lin Mingyi, Lin Mingyi! Lin Mingyi! Shush! What is it? What are you doing? Let's go. All these people, how can we...? Let's go! Spare him his life. Xiaomei. Captain, please spare him. Who the hell are you? She is Guo Xiaomei. Captains, it's better make friends than make enemies. You are Guo Xiaomei? The one who inherited the jade statue of Mazu? This is she. Xiaomei, leave this. I have to kill these evil men. Wait! Captains, I know I am not a part of this world. But I do know you guys value loyalty and bond. I would like to offer the jade statue of Mazu to solve the troubles between you two. But I hope you two could stop harming the people down the mountain. Captain, please. Fine, I'll do it. Xiaomei is truly a gracious person, I admire you. Huang Tianzong! This is between Huang Tianzong and me. Please stay out of this. This thing between Huang Family and Guo Family will be settled today! There is never an end of taking revenge. Xiaomei. Are you okay? Let's go! Longer. I thought if I had the jade statue of Mazu, I could free your spirit. Was I actually wrong? Dad, dad. Granny is awake. Mom, you are finally awake! Mom is awake! She finally woke up! Finally! Master, master! What's with the hurry? Master, the young mistress saved the young master! That's so great! A double blessing has descended upon the house! [Stone House]
