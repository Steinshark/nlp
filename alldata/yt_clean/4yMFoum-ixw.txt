All our problems can be removed in a moment if God chooses to bestow His grace. We can be released from this cycle of life and death and attain the supreme destination. The question that arises then is, "Why is God miserly in bestowing that grace?" After all, He is our father. Does he not know that we are suffering here? One soul fights with God, ~Verse~. The soul says, "Oh, Shri Krishna, should I speak my mind to you today?" Sri Krishna said, "Go ahead." Maharaj, You will not like it. Never mind, I'm used to the grumblings of the souls. We people sometimes we think even against God, and He seated inside is completely aware of it. But He says, "Never mind." So, Shri Krishna says, "Oh soul, what is your complaint?" The soul now spoke up, "Maharaj, in the world if a little infant is fallen into a ditch and a passer by happens to be there and sees the wailing of the little baby, that passer by is move to pity. They lift up the child, quieten the child, feed the child, try and find out the parents, and if the parents are not traceable, the child is deposited in an orphanage or in the police station. But Shri Krishna, nobody in this world is so hard hearted as to throw the child back into the ditch. Jao Maro. Shri Krishna said, "That is very right, human beings have that kind of compassion. If they don't, they will not be insaan, they will be shaitaan. But soul, what is the point you are trying to make?" The soul now came to the crux of the matter. Maharaj, like the infant, we are your little children. You have stated in the Vedas, &lt;i&gt;"Amritasyavai Putra."&lt;/i&gt; All the souls in this world, I'm their seed giving Father, and you are aware of our suffering. We getting knocked around by the waves of Maya. We are valuing in ignorance, we are bereft of knowledge, love and bliss, and You our eternal Father are perfectly competent to bestow by Your grace everything our soul needs. Why are You being so hard hearted Shri Krishna? And don't blame me, if you say, "Oh soul you come to my door and I'll grace you." Maharaj, I do not know the way to your doorstep. I am admitting I am ignorant. But You don't have any such alibi. You are &lt;i&gt;sarvagyaa&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Akhand Gyanatmak.&lt;/i&gt; Besides, you possess various titles in this world, &lt;i&gt;Akaran Karun,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Patit Pawan, &lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Deen Bandhu, &lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Binu Hetu Sanehi,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Adham Udharan Haar.&lt;/i&gt; So Maharaj, "What will happen to these titles? Quickly bestow your grace or Your fair name will be tainted in this world." The soul leveled its accusation and Bhagwan now answered, "Aye jeev, chota muh badi baat." I am reputed to be extremely soft hearted and you have insinuated that I am harsh and cruel. But I ask you oh soul, "You have demanded grace on the basis that you are my child. My question to you is do you actually believe this relationship?" Think? In your heart, do you have this faith that God is my father? Where do you? Your decision is, He is also my father, but I have never seen Him. The worldly father is ten times more important. Shri Krishna says, "When you go to the temple, you say there, &lt;i&gt;Twameva Maataa Ca&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Pitaa Twameva &lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Twameva Sarvam ||&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Oh Shri Krishna, &lt;/i&gt; you alone are my father. You alone are my mother. So, have that conviction in your heart. God says, "Look, if I grace you, do you know what will I give you? What Maharaj? My divine bliss, divine knowledge, divine love, and what will I take in return? I don't know, Maharaj. Listen, there are no free lunches in this world. One lady, went to Narsinh Mehta, a famous bhakti saint of medieval times in Gujarat, and she said to Narsinhji, "You have had darshan of Shri Krishna so many times." As per the biographies on Narsinh Mehta, Shri Krishna revealed himself in his personal form to that saint between 50 to 100 times. So the lady was saying, "Why is Shri Krishna not revealing himself to me? And what about all the other human beings on the planet? Why is bhagwan partial towards you or others?" Narsinh Mehta said that, "God has an eligibility if you qualify yourself, no matter who you may be, He will be willing to reveal himself." The lady refused to take that logic. Next day, Narsinh Mehta arranged for somebody to go to her and to beg for a loan for the maintenance of his family. The lady flat refused. When the man pleaded, she said, "I don't have faith that you will return the money back." Just a little after that, Narsinh himself came and he said to the lady, "Mataji, I am in dire need right now. If you can give me this much of a loan for a couple of weeks, it will be a saving grace." The lady said, "Of course, why not? Narsinh said, "A few hours ago this man came and you outright refused to him. How come you have agreed to give me the loan so easily?" The lady said, "Because he is untrustworthy, while you are." Likewise said Narsinh Mehta, "When God bestows his grace, he needs to know that we will utilize it properly and hence he has got a condition on the basis of which he bestows the grace." So what is that condition? Let's take a look from my latest book, &lt;i&gt;Spiritual Secrets from Hinduism.&lt;/i&gt; God's eternal law is very simple. Those who are &lt;i&gt;sharanagat&lt;/i&gt;, surrendered to God receive His grace. All the Scriptures from the Vedas to the Ramayana emphasize the principle of &lt;i&gt;Sharanagati&lt;/i&gt;. Let us take a look. The &lt;i&gt;Shvetashvatara Upanishad&lt;/i&gt; of the Krishna Ajurveda states, ~Verse~, meaning, we take shelter of that supreme being who created Brahma and others by His grace, the soul and intellect get illumined. The &lt;i&gt;Srimad Bhagvatam&lt;/i&gt; states in its 11th canto, &lt;i&gt;Mam ekam eva saranam,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;atmanam sarva-dehinam |&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; yahi sarvatma-bhavena, &lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;maya sya hy akuto-bhayah ||&lt;/i&gt; Oh Uddhava, Shri Krishna is saying, giving up all forms of mundane, social and religious conventions, simply surrender unto me the Supreme Lord of all souls only then can you cross over this material ocean and become fearless. The &lt;i&gt;Bhagavad Gita &lt;/i&gt; too says, &lt;i&gt;"tam eva sharanam gachchha&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;sarva-bhavena bharata,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;tat-prasadat param shantim&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;sthanam prapsyasi shashvatam ||&lt;/i&gt; 62nd verse of the 18th chapter, "Oh Arjun, surrender to the Supreme Divine personality, who will then bestow his divine grace upon you, and by virtue of His mercy, you will then attain unmitigated peace and the supreme abode." There's a very powerful verse in the Bhagavad Gita regarding the concept of surrender. This is the 14th verse of the seventh chapter. Shri Krishna starts off by saying, daivi hyesha guna-mayi mama maya duratyaya I Arjun, the material energy maya is extremely difficult to overcome. Why? Mama Maya. It is my energy. It has as much of power as I do. If anybody can conquer Maya, it means they have conquered God, for they have overcome His shakti. Now God is ajit, undefeatable, and so also is His maya. Biggest yogis, munis, rishis, tapasvis will fail before it. So Arjun ask then, Maharaj, how will I be redeemed? Shri Krishna answered in the second line of the verse, &lt;i&gt;Mam eva ye prapadyante &lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;mayam etam taranti te || &lt;/i&gt; Arjun if you surrender unto me, I will then indicate to maya, "Oh maya, this soul has become mine. Release him." Maya says, "When Maya Pati is instructing me then naturally I must obey." Maya says, "My job was just this much, to keep on troubling the soul until it gives itself at the lotus feet of God. Once that is done, my job is over. I release you from the cycle of life and death. So, all these scriptures are telling us that in order to receive the divine mercy, we will need to do &lt;i&gt;sharanagati&lt;/i&gt;. The soul says, "My Lord, can it not be that I don't do &lt;i&gt;sharanagati&lt;/i&gt; and still you grace me? What do you mean? I mean, you know you are not tied by rules. Rules are for us unfortunate souls. Shri Krishna says, "No rules are for everyone." There are so many rules in this cosmos in accordance with which the celestial bodies are moving. If there is a little problem, they will all collide with each other. We have rules for the body. Don't eat beyond the limits. You'll fall sick. Don't eat less than the limits. You will again falls sick. Don't sleep too much. Don't sleep too little, and so on and so forth. God says, I also have my rules. &lt;i&gt;Karma pradhan &lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;vishwa kari rakha | &lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Jo jas karai &lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;so tasa phalau chakha ||&lt;/i&gt; The rules says, "As you sow that shall you also reap." So God says, "If, without your &lt;i&gt;sharanagati&lt;/i&gt;, I were to grace you, it would create tremendous disorder in humankind. Why? Consider this example. A father had a paddy field and two young sons whom he engaged for cultivation, when the need was excessive. He called them over one morning and said, "This is the sowing season. When a lot of hard work is required, go and toil it out." The younger son sweated it in the sun from morning till night. When he returned, the father gleefully gave him Rs1,000 and said, "Well done, my child. Go and have a ball." The elder son did nothing. He kept lying in bed, abusing his father, drinking, smoking, etc. At night, if the father says, "Never mind, you are also my child. You may be mad, but I should be a good father. Here's Rs1,000, go enjoy yourself." Now, you may say that this is an act of grace by the father, an act of kindness. But factually, it will have the reverse effect. Why? It will break the faith of the other brother in hard work, loyalty and dedication. He will say, "What kind of justice is this? I've worked from morning till night and got $1,000. My brother did nothing. He was given the same remuneration. If this is the respect my father has for dedication in that case, tomorrow I will also not work. I will lie around, smoke, drink, say what I like. I'll get the thousand rupees in any case." Likewise, God says that, "If without your &lt;i&gt;sharanagati&lt;/i&gt;, I bestow my grace upon you. All the saints will complain, "Maharaj, what is this? We strived so hard for so many lifetimes." ~Verse~ And then we became recipients of your mercy and you have bestowed your mercy in free fund on this soul. Then what was the meaning of our surrender? So God says, "I will never violate my law." You want my grace? Yes, Shri Krishna. Surrender yourself then. No Shri Krishna, I don't want your grace. Don't surrender. Shri Krishna, I want your grace, but I don't want to surrender. Shri Krishna says, "This ghapad shapad will not do. Only when you do that act of surrender, will you receive your cherished grace." So we have reached a station in this journey in the &lt;i&gt;Spiritual Secrets&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;from Hinduism.&lt;/i&gt; We need to &lt;i&gt;surrender&lt;/i&gt;. We will now understand what is the meaning of surrender as we proceed in this series.
