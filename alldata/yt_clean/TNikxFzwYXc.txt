I saw it with my own eyes, Ma Ballsy has been going into the mountains for days. Every time, he would bring back gold. So he's made a fortune out of the dead. Open it! Do I smell good? Yes, of course! Stop it, demon! This fox demon was originally from Mount Dragon-tiger, it's a thousand-year-old fox spirit. It tried to practice dark magic by tricking people coming its way, to devour people's hearts. Thanks to this passerby, who suppressed this demon here, under Mount Dragon-tiger. Where is this man? That person, is right there. There? The sky is black, the earth is yellow. Road of life and death deems hollow. Three immortal souls, seven mortal forms. The yin-yang barrier is the norm. The sun, the moon, the mountains and the rivers. The world has a definite number. Just beside the Mount Dragon-tiger, you'll see a demigod standing saunter. Green pupils! Green pupils! So scary! Go, go, go! Come on. Today is the day of the Treasure Hunt in the Ghost Market. You guys are in for a treat. Guys, listen to me. This is the 18th generation of the Earth Master, The Eye of the Underworld, Master Qi. Driving out demons and spirits, fortune-telling and divination, stargazing, spotting the dead's house, he can do everything. Master. I heard that within the hanging coffins of Mount Dragon-tiger, there's a book, a treasure. Tomb Making Notes. Is there such a thing? Mysteries of heaven must not be revealed. Let me tell you something. The Master is busy. Hurry up. You don't have much time. Excuse me. Excuse me. The great Master. An honorable man would like you to read his fortune. Can you two come with me? Master doesn't come out easily. It depends on if you are destined to work with the Master. It's destiny! It's destiny. Please, both of you. Just go straight ahead and turn right. That's a lot of money. Do you know where this money came from? We don't take money if it's not clean. Just relax. Later, just follow my lead. Don't cause any more trouble. I'm a gold-toucher, street name, the Pangolin Armor. Yes. Flowers bloom on the other side! We're opening for business today. I don't think it's that simple. Don't be so paranoid. As the old saying goes, Wealth and riches are amidst perilous odds. Anyone else down there who wants to get rich? The Pangolin didn't get through after all. It's the Nine-grid Glazed-tiger Lock. Something's not right. Let's go. Please, that way. Be careful. Yee! So this is the Master you got for me! Brother Bea. Look what he's got in his hand. The Golden-jade Locking Plate, a traditional artifact from the Earth Master only. No offense. Scared the crap out of me. What's going on? Nine-grid Glazed-tiger Lock. When the yang moves, forward. When the yin moves, retreat. Change one yin and one yang, amalgamate them into fifteen. In which Polaris takes the number to line nine-grid. It's open. Is it open? He's good at this. It's open! Look. He is the real deal. Cut the crap. He's getting rich! What's this? What is this? Don't move. Danger! Nephew! Come on! What happened? What the hell is that? It's the Yin Tai Sui that devours people's yin spirit. Nephew. We went through a lot to make some money. In the end, it's not even enough to buy medicine for your stupid Master. I heard that a lot of grave robbers have made a fortune out of the dead lately. Nephew. Listen to me. Let's change careers. No, think about it. With what you're capable now, plus your uncle, me, who is like a silver-tongue, we're guaranteed to be succe... Hu Deshui. You have the nerve to say that? I almost lost my life today. And I'm a Earth Master. I build and fix tombs. Not a grave robber. Don't ever mention it to me again. You never listen to me. Master. Master. Master. Master. Master. Why did you put on your death suit again? I dreamt of Ox-Head and Horse-Face. They said I've reached the end of my life. I thought, I can still move by myself. -Slow down. -So I changed into it. Save other people the trouble. Master, don't talk nonsense. It's my fault, really. The fortune teller said you'll live to be over 100. Tai Sui sitting right upon your shoulder. A disaster is right around the corner. Nephew. Don't go. Don't go. Don't go. Put it down. Put it down. Put it down. My nephew. Come on. Have a look. See what this is all about. Will you get over that habit for a second? Stop taking things from dead people. You're not afraid of karma? Death is like a lamp extinguishing. It's just a dead skeleton. Besides. It's such a nice piece of antique. We can't waste it for nothing. Gold tobacco pipe. Mid-Kan, water. Jade wrapped pipe. It's my predecessor, Jiang Wuji. Jiang Wuji? Isn't that your Grand-Master's first student? Well, if you say so, then it must be worth a lot! Hanging coffins of Mount Dragon-tiger? In broad daylight, in this world, you little thief, how dare you come to my house and rob me? I don't hit women. Put it down. I'll let you go. Green pupils. Take them alive. Nine-edge Demon-Crushing Sword. Yun Ayier of the Owl Sect. Boss. This bitch is carrying a dozen lives on her back. I heard she can do evil magic. Watch out for her eyes, people. Wait a minute! You want to die? I'm the only one who's seen the map. Anyone who wants to enter Mount Dragon-tiger's tombs, will have to work with me. Sure. I've heard about the Green-eyed Night Owl. They're all good grave robbers. Today, I'll see what you can do. We can't afford to mess with these dudes. Let's get out of here. What are you talking about? Hanging coffins of Mount Dragon-tiger have the most yin spirit. For thousands of years, whoever went there, never returns. If you turn around now, there's still time. Who are you bluffing? Tomb Making Notes is a collection of the methods used to build the royal tombs of the past generations. We're going to get it. Come on! -I know how to walk. -Go! Green peak with a sudden stroke of the pen. An oblique illumination of hanging coffins. Twisting and turning in loops in front of a mountain. The tomb should be nearby. Sister Cee. Don't bullshit me. Come on! Over there! Over there! Please. There are rules in the business. I can't help however much I would like to. Boss. That's how Owl Sect hears things to figure out whereabouts. My Grand-Master must have added a figurine clock to the tomb. She can't hear it. Boss. Don't worry about it. I brought dynamite anyway. We can blast it open. Reckless! You're on. Watch out! You have two laps of time. Nephew. Figure something out! Do something, nephew. One lap to go. Nephew! Nephew! Do something. I don't want to die, nephew! Figure something out! Nephew! All things in heaven and earth are divided into yin and yang. The universe is in the numbers when ghosts and gods in hiding. With Nine-grid Flying Star Tianhan Formation, I search for the tomb and determine the four directions! The tomb is right... Where is it? Right... Right down the mountain. Down the hill? Hu! Hu! Hu! He fell himself. Nephew! Help me! Help me! Nephew! Hu! Nephew! I'm here. Help me! Don't be afraid. I'm coming to save you. Be careful. Be careful. I almost fell. Yeah. Hu. Dude, aren't you lucky? Nephew. Scared the crap out of me. Are you okay? Untie me. Mysterious Gates Parallel Lotus. Go over there! It's like a trigram disk in the center. What. The Golden-jade Locking Plate. What Golden-jade Locking Plate? I don't understand. Oh, yeah. Come on! Once the lotus flower on the tomb door opens, the door to life opens. But a day later, the lotus flower will fall, the door to life will close. That means we only have 24 hours. Exquisite brushwork. The figure has both form and spirit. One look at the painting and it must be from the Tang Dynasty. Boss. This is Guo Dingfeng's tomb! Definitely! Look, Hu. What's this? Let go of Master Bea! Boss. I told you before. This evil bitch has immense dark magic capabilities. This wall is painted with the Eighteen Diagrams of Hell. We're at the entrance to hell. Fighting each other will only downsizing ourselves. Besides, this woman is useful. I don't care about you guys. Playing tricks again, I have no mercy. Come on! So scary. Don't move. Guo Dingfeng, that old son of a bitch! He should have been dug up a long time ago. What are you looking at? Ancient magic tricks are something I've been toying with for a long time. What if I tell them about this? What's going to happen? Nephew. What does this mural mean? Boss. Come on! Let's go have a look. Are there...? I get it. Guo Dingfeng is gathering grievances to attack the Dragon Fury. These dead children have a deep-seated grievance. It can be used to guide the dead to the afterlife. The Eighteen Diagrams of Hell, young children show the way to netherworld. This is one of the 72 burial methods, Child Holding. We really can't go any further. Young fellow. You think I'm scared? Keep going. Yes. Stop looking at it. It's even scarier than your Master. Let's go. It moved! Stop it! What's your game? Come on! It's really moving! I think two kids just passed by. Where did it go? Where? Where? I was just passing by. No offense! Don't blame me! Don't blame me! The ghost! It's in his bag! Shut your trap! -Yee. -You scared me. Turn around. Boss. Turn around. I just saw a leg. It's in his bag! What? What do you mean? Hu! On your shoulders. Go! Get out of the way! What's going on? What's wrong with me? Could it be...? Was that a hallucination? No. The hallucinations are already causing people to attack each other. What are you doing? The candles are dosed. They are hallucinogenic. Come with me if you want him to live. Don't come up here. Don't bite me! Don't bite me! Don't bite me! Go! Go! Hurry! I say, we just leave, just like that? What a pity! There are so many treasures in the tomb. If you want to stay, stay and feed the zombies yourself. I'm just saying. Cut the crap. Let's just go. If we don't get out of here, they'll catch up with us. Boss. I haven't found them yet. Keep looking. They won't get far. Sister Cee. You're so pretty. Boss. This is a very evil tomb. Do you think we can find the notes we were looking for? Boss. Don't worry. I got the tip from the gold-touchers. It's a sure thing. Besides, even without the Tomb Making Notes, we'll still have a lot of treasures. Right. We'll exchange it for money when we get it. Once we have money, get me some Browning Pistol. Get the boys some German machine gun, too. Freaking Qin Beard. Just because he's a lapdog for the Japanese, he gets to occupy my turf, kill my brothers. If I don't have my revenge, I swear I'll give up my life. What are you doing? Brother Yee. I'm just getting some medicine. Here. Thank you, Brother Yee. Master is wearing his death suit again. I don't want him to be alone. It's not the first time Master has done this. And again, we all have to go through life, sooner or later, we'll all have to report to God of Death. Hu Deshui. How many times have I told you? Don't call me Hu Deshui. Call me uncle. I... Boss. Why the face? -Watch me... -Don't be so brutal. That hurt, didn't it? Not really. See, Sister Cee is the beat of Drunken Flower House! What a slut. Help us find the thing. I'll give you a good reward. What? What reward? You tell me. Me... I... No more tricks. Or I'll kill you. Boss. We've found the way. Come on! Sis. Our boss asked me to deliver a message. We're sorry for what we did just now. Thank you for saving us. If you need our help in the future, just say the word. Thanks. Sis. I don't know if I should ask, why did you have to come here? Boss. Something's wrong with Yee. Ever since that incident three years ago, Yee has become a very different person. Watch over for him more often. Why did you save me? If you kill me, no one will know your secret. I saved you because you're still useful. More bullshit, I'll kill you now. I'm telling you, this bitch is a tough one. Boss! Split up and look for secret compartments and such. Yes. Yes. Yes, boss. Yes. Come on! Be careful. Watch out. Slow down a bit. What's this? It's the Candle Dragon from hell. It's rumored to be in charge of the entrance to hell. After you die, if you want to go to the underworld, you have to go through it. Why is this layout so strange? What's this? Ancient Jade, maybe. Ancient Jade? Hu! Run! Let's go! Run! The door is locked! Why is the door closed? You bastard! What did you just touch? Dude, I... A chessboard? Guo Dingfeng wants to play with us! What kind of chessboard has 81 squares? This little square is distributed by the nine-grid trigrams. Let Hu go. If you want to live, you have to listen to me. Nine-grid followed by nine-grid. Nine-grid with Yi Numbers. If we want to break this mechanism, we should start with the Nine-grid with Yi Numbers. Nine-grid with Yi Numbers. I know a little bit about it too. These little spaces corresponds with separate numbers that need to be filled in. It should be horizontal, vertical, diagonal all adds up to fifteen. Bea. You've read a lot. Try it. There you go. Wait a minute! I don't think it's that simple. Two and four are shoulders, six and eight are foot, three is left, and seven is right, wear nine on top, wear one down under, five is in central. It's open. It's open! It's open. Master Bea! Brilliant! You're the best, Brother Bea. Bea. Fantastic. Get out of the way! What's going on? This is all deliberate, noting to be alarmed about. Ef! Let's go! Pull back! Boss. Let's go! Ayi! Candle Dragon? How is that a real thing? The mechanism is a trap. The Grand-Master wants us to sacrifice to this monster. Ayi! Ayi! Ayi! It's okay, Ayi. Ayi! Run! Hu, run! Do something. Or we'll all die here. Death? Life is death, death is life. The door of death is the door of life. The door's open. Let's go! Come on. Nephew. Come on! Go, go, go! Go! Come on! Go, go, go! Organize our gears. Prepare to cross the river. Boss. You can't see the end of the river. If we force our way across the river, isn't it too risky? Boss, look. Let's cross the river! Yes. Sister Cee. I can't swim. Let's go together. If I'll be able to cross the river with Sister Cee, I'll be happy as a dead man. What are you talking about? Come on. For real? Sister Cee. Come here. Watch out. I've had a real eye-opening experience today. Rumor has it that the Green Pupil kills without blinking an eye, but you just tricks to fool people. One look at a man can drive him crazy. It's just some powdered medicine when no one's looking. Burning paper with your bare hands is nothing more than a little yellow phosphorus. You are just a little girl. Why disguise yourself as a demoness? People's disguises are usually rooted in self-preservation. Why do I feel weird? It feels like something's following us. I thought it was strange, too. Look at that. What a fuss. Hu! Help me. I can't swim! Boss. It's hard to see through water. Boss. What do we do? What's that? Watch out! Run! Hu! Watch out! Hu! Ghost! Ghost! There's no such thing as ghosts. It's just a female corpse controlled by necromantic worms. Watch out! Run! Go! Come on! What the heck is this? Let's go! Go! Get in there. Hurry! Come on, come on. Boss. It's a dead end! Bea. See what can be done! Get out of the way. Look for a mechanism. Come on. Come on. Come on. Get out of the way! Come on, come on, come on. Hurry! Come on. Come on. Come on, let's go. It's open. The door's open. Come on, come on! These... After eighty-one hurdles, it looks like we're finally going to get we are asking for today. Nephew. Slap me! I'm not dreaming, am I? We're rich! So many treasures. Boss. We can pull out now. With these babies, we can buy any airplanes or cannons we want. What's the point of looking for a stupid book? The Tomb Making Notes notes is priceless. Compared to that, these are just a drop in the bucket. Brothers. Even if you have to turn the whole thing upside down, I want to find the Tomb Making Notes. Yes. It's because of the eyes. What eyes? You mean... You're pretending because of your eyes. Your people have always been known as Green-eyed Night Owls. You've always been treated like monsters. You suffered terribly. I understand that. Sister Cee. What are you giggling about? You are so nice to me. You want to marry me? Yes! Don't joke with me. I'll take it seriously. I'm not kidding. I'll take the comb. You went into the tomb this time to cure your people's eyes, didn't you? How do you know? Don't be nervous. My Master told me. There's a record of the Tomb of the Medicine King in the Tomb Making Notes. For centuries, countless people in our family have searched for the Medicine King's tomb. They all died in tombs. This time I have to find the Tomb Making Notes. I'm running out of time. You mean your eyes...? Can you even understand? The true descendant of Earth Master is right here. Riding spirits... Just a regular burial guide. What's going on? What's happening? What's going on? Nephew. Nephew! Be careful, everyone. Nephew! What's the situation? I got it. Press this button. This floor will stop. But the people on the other side would fall into the deep end. Boss. They're forcing us to kill each other. Let's not press it. Nobody presses it. We'll be brothers in the after life! Sure. Okay, then we have a deal. No one presses the button. If you want to die, don't drag me into it. Don't move. We are alive! Camouflaged painting! We are alive. Bea! You dirty old shit! Bea! I was just going to make a fortune with you. Then go back and restore my family. But the Tomb Making Notes is still missing. I can't risk my life. Everybody! I'm so sorry. It's a self-inflicted disaster. This place is falling apart. Go! Hurry! Come on! Go! Run! What's going on? Nephew, let's go. Come on! Come on! Come on! Hurry! Sister Cee. -Sister Cee! -Cannon! Come on! Cannon! Sister Cee, we should leave! Cannon! Come on! Cannon! Let go of me! Cannon! You let go of me! Go save him! Cannon! Cannon! Go save Cannon! Cannon! Big brother! Cannon! Cannon! Cannon! Be careful, Yee! Brother Yee? Brother Yee! Let's go, Brother Yee! -Jay! -Let's go! -Jay! -Brother Yee! Hurry! Jay! Jay! Nephew. We're out of there, aren't we? No. This valley is part of the tomb. How are your eyes? Better. All I want now is to find the Tomb Making Notes. Thirteen of us. Some are dead, some are wounded. Now it's just the five of us. They're all dead. How are we going to take back our turf? I'm not going down into the tomb. Boss. You decide. Let's go. What do you mean? Right in front of Master Guan Yu, we all sworn to be brothers. You're betraying our big brother! I'll be the first to say no. Yee! Don't you mess with me! If you hadn't egged big brother on, we wouldn't be in this shithole. What the hell are you talking about? Yee! Let them go. Boss. I'm the one who got my brothers killed. You guys go. I won't let our brothers die in vain. Whatever happens, I'm gonna get the Tomb Making Notes. Governor Liu has promised me, if we get the stuff, he'll provide me with manpower, guns. I will avenge my brothers. Yee! Cee! You guys should leave as well. Boss. I owe my life to big brother. I'll go wherever big brother goes. If Cannon is still alive, I'm sure he won't leave big brother alone. Cowards! Who are you talking about? You know who I was talking about. God damn it! We're all going to die anyway. I'm not a coward who's afraid to die. Come on! Upon seeing a long mountain, a dragon vein is discovered. If the peak is high as heaven, dragon's body is uncovered. This mountain range stretches long. This is a dragon vein. The underground cavern we passed through earlier, is the body of a dragon. This valley is the dragon's neck. The cave is just ahead, at the dragon's head. But... I don't think my Grand-Master's grave is that simple. There's a trapdoor on every level. It's as if someone led us here. Whatever fishy's going on, I have to try it. Stop looking at her. I'm telling you, nephew. Look at that road. Looks like we can walk out of here. Let's go back. What? You found your conscience? No... After what happened to me, I finally understood. Ten thousand pieces of gold are no better than my life. Money is nothing. Also, I've got all the good stuff! Hu! You go home first. I can't let them get their hands on the Tomb Making Notes. Take care of Master for me. You think I don't know what you are thinking, kid? That witch must have gotten to you! I'm telling you, you've been bewitched! Nephew. Wait for me. This is Guo Dingfeng's underground palace? How magnificent! This is Guo Dingfeng's tomb. Why is it a statue of a woman? This could be the woman Guo Dingfeng likes. Heroes always have had a hard time resisting beauty. Right? Nephew. How are we gonna get there? Boss. They're here. It's you again. It's like you are ghosts on our tails. Gee! Aych! Nephew. I'm afraid! I don't think there's a mechanism. Be careful. These educated folks, they sure are different. Persnickety even after they're dead. The dungeon is the tomb of the owner. It's not logical to build on such a cold, damp place. The feng shui pattern of this place the ghosts could clash with the tomb, making this place full of yin spirits. Clashing with the tomb? You're telling me this is a body farm? Build the underground palace in a place where the ghosts could clash with the tomb, is a great taboo when building tombs. My Grand-Master wouldn't make such a big mistake. What's the problem? I don't care what the taboo is. Pry it open. Don't! This tomb guard must have a hidden weapon. Once the coffin is violently opened, what's inside will be burned to the ground. Open it! It's the writing on the wall that counts. Get out of the way. This wall contains the Sexagenary cycle. Eight holes. Is it the birthdate of Grand-Master? What a coincidence. It's like swatting flies with cow's tail. Guo Dingfeng's birthdate, my nephew will know. You don't know? It's been over a thousand years. How should I know? Goddamn it! We've lost so many brothers along the way. We can't go all the way here for nothing. Brothers. Break it down! I'll see who dares to move. Wait a minute! What did you just say? I said break it down. All the way... Could the birthdate be inside the tombs before? What do you mean? We've been through Child showing the way, Nine-grid compass, Female corpse under the river, and sacrifice life by jumping off a cliff. &quot;Child showing the way&quot; is built into the mountain wall. Of the Five Agents, it belongs to Earth. The Earth is Wu. The child placed in the center. And Chou in the center belongs to yin-Earth. In the nine-grid tomb, the door of death is the door of life. It is the Field Trigram. The direction is southwest. Corresponding to Ding, and Wei. The yin River belongs to Water. The coffin belongs to Wood. Corresponding to Ren, and Yin. And in the cliff tomb, jewelry belongs to Metal. Corresponding to Xin. And there's a jade dragon on the wall. Corresponding to Chen. Grand-Master's birthdate is year Wu Chou, month Ding Wei, date Ren Yin, hour Xin Chen. I'll be in charge of Wu. The rest of you get one each. I'll get Chou. I'm get the high one. Let's hurry. It's Chou! I got it. Open the coffin. What happened to your eyes? I'm fine. Hurry! Ready! Stick 'em! What's going on? We are trapped by the mechanism. Tell me what to do. There's a gear in five steps northeast. Make it stop. What are you doing? Stop! Stay back! Yee! What are you doing? A child! I told you guys he had a baby in his bag! Yee! You...! Boss. Actually, I'm a member of the gold-touchers. My Great-Grand-Master once told me a secret. This coffin not only contains Guo Dingfeng, it also contains his wife. His wife died in an accident. Guo Dingfeng was in agony. Eventually, he found this body farm, trying to resurrect his wife. You mean... What we did today, it's all so Guo Dingfeng can revive his wife? Is this a sacrificial ceremony? Exactly! My child can also be resurrected. There's just one more step to go. It's to sacrifice all of your lives! There is no such thing as the Tomb Making Notes in this world! All of this, it's just a front concocted by Guo Dingfeng! I don't believe it. You're lying. The Tomb Making Notes must be here. You don't believe me? Then you'll be the first to be sacrificed! Come here. Yee! You went to great lengths to trick us into going to the tomb. It killed so many of our brothers. Just to resurrect your child? Boss. I'm the one who got my kid killed. I have to save him. If there is an afterlife, I owe you one. I'll repay you in my next life. You maniac! You're crazy. Keep on dreaming! You can kill us all, it won't revive your kid! You want to die? I'll kill you! You fool! You don't believe the Tomb Making Notes exists, but you believe your child can come back to life? My Master told me a long time ago, this body farm is nothing but a place of famine. Hair and nails can grow because of the protein. Don't waste your efforts. The more you do now, the more you sin, the less of a chance your child can reincarnate. You shut the hell up. As long as I kill you all, my child will come back to life! Yee! You're going to die. Gee! Gee! Gee! Come on out! Yee! Yee, don't. Yee! Yee! Zombie! Zombies are real! Get out of the way! I have a gun in my waistband! Sister Cee. Boss. Let it go. Boss. Go! Where are the ganging coffins? Is there a Tomb Making Notes in there? Stop worrying about it! If we don't leave, we'll all die here. Don't be a downer. We're not even at the door to death yet. Come on! Go! Come on! Zhang Guidan! Leave! She's taken her pills. And the bleeding stopped. Why is she still unconscious? She's lost a lot of blood. And she's been in shock. She needs to rest and recuperate. Hey. Zhang Guidan and his gang, they have a heart of gold after all. In the end, look what's happened to them. A hundred years passes by without a trace. It's all in vain. Oh, man. You can't be too stubborn. I didn't think you have it in you, Hu. Quite a deep-thinker. But people eat, so we feel. It's not easy to just let go. Yeah, that's true. Just like me. I can't stop thinking about the treasure in that tomb. Tell me. Is it worth anything? In my opinion, this looks like a wine vessel. Are your eyes up your forehead? This is children's chamber pot. A chamber pot? Nephew. Wait for me!
