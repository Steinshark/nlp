What did you say was wrong with her again? Dementia. It just came with old age. And then it got worse and worse. At first, she would just forget like dates and places. And then it progressed. Now, sometimes she doesn't It can be pretty harsh. I can't even imagine It must be really hard. Yeah, it's rough. So why has it been so hard finding someone to take care of her? My mom's a handful. She's just very picky about I just want the best for her. But between the constant stress and being away from home everyone just quits. What do you mean "being Someone to be with her 24/7. Living at the house. I would hate for her to get hurt or something to happen to her when she was alone. Yeah, of course. I understand. You wouldn't want to do this full time. It would be stupid of me It would be only temporary until we find someone else. Look, Mr. Bloom, if this is the kind of job It's nothing against you. I don't think I can do I'm in a desperate situation, I'll pay anything. At least for a little while. To have someone I could trust to know she's safe.
