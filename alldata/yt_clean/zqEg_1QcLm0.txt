Let's send you and Liusia I'm okay. Are we going to the HQ or your house? I'll walk. When my husband went I decided to become a nurse. No matter where they send him, Here is my certificate. Nurses school. Good job, comrade Bogdanova. With distinction! We need specialists like you I'll do my best but... Of course it is. And you will have plenty. Look at the orphanage we sponsor. They didn't have a nurse for six months. Meanwhile, kids keep falling sick. How did you meet lieutenant Bogdanov? That's simple. We were both dumped at the same orphanage. -Really? That's why we have the same surname, There was this religious nurse there. I like it. No room for mistake. So, so far you've been together Looks like it. I hope it's for good, not so far. Weird. What's weird? Raisa Vasilyevna. Momma... Are we there yet? No, we're driving by the warehouse. -I wanted... Raisa Vasilyevna. Do I have a choice? Go for it. We don't want you to wet -I'll be right back. Just make sure the guards don't shoot you. I'll strangle you like END OF EPISODE ONE
