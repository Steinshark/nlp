Lego Mario has to enter the Nintendo The little one is trapped in Can Mario rescue the baby from the cave? Please don't worry baby Yoshi. I'm coming to rescue you. Hey Mario, wait a minute. If you need any help just call me. Please don't forget that. That's so sweet of you. Thank you so much. But now I have to go because I'm late. Lets go to the cave. The yellow Yoshi is trapped somewhere. Let's go! Um, not in a cave? But the complete opposite is the case. I'm above the clouds. Wait a minute. Somehow I probably took the wrong pipe. Oh dear. This is getting off to a good start. Uhm, I actually need your help right now. Wow. That was quicker than I thought. Let me support Mario then. Hey Mario. I thought you were going into a cave? Yeah, I thought that too. And how do I get down from the clouds? Just a moment. I will find a solution. I still have my somewhere near my house. It wasn't here? No, not there either but. Aha. Over there. Of course. My plane! I always park my plane next to the tree. Okay, let's go then. Don't worry Mario. I'm coming. With the help of the airplane I will bring you down from the clouds. Don't do an extra lap now and come to me. I'm already coming... and now hold on tight. Oh that's really sweet But please be careful. There are cannons everywhere. Don't worry Mario. I fly by plane once a year. I can do that. What? That doesn't sound very often. Oh dear. Come on. We are almost there. I'm going to land now and Alright Yoshi. But That wasn't a soft landing. But at least im down on the ground now. What kind of bugs are you? Away with you. And where's the cave? And back in Yoshi's house. Mario, I've come to help you... Luigi? Where are you going? Mario Don't worry, I'm coming... What? Oh I'm going to help Mario. Of course. I'm sure my balloons will be a great help. Mario. I'll be right with you. The balloons will help you in the cave. Hey, there's Luigi up ahead. Hey my brother. What are you doing here? I'm here to help you Mario. And how exactly? Well, I've got balloons. They must be handy in the cave. Oh Luigi, I don't think so. I'm sorry but I have to get going. Okay. Too bad. Oh my dear brother. I always appreciate it I mean, But now its my turn to save baby Yoshi. Ok. I should be more careful... So come over here little Chain Chomp. That looks very striking. I wonder if there's a Okay. Oh indeed. Let's see where this pipe takes me. Baby Yoshi, here I come. Oh, we've gone deeper into the cave. Oh no. That's a lot of monty moles. Yoshi, I really need your help. Do you think you have a power up for me? Oh wow. That's a lot of moles... Don't worry Mario. I will find something suitable for you. Hey Yoshi, want some help? No, no, thats alright. Okay. Too bad. How do you defeat so Hmm. There's a question mark block! Maybe I will find a superstar there. Hey, a fire flower. That's not so bad. I'm sure that will help Mario. I can't wait to see what he will say. Hey Mario, look. I've brought you a fire flower. Hey, great. That's really handy. Now I'm Fire Mario... and just flatten the monty moles. Very nice. Whoa. It's pretty windy here in the cave. Oof. Lots of spikes. Another challenge, another obstacle. Yoshi, Oh, you would need something like What are we going to do now? Hmm. How could I best support my brother?.. Huh? What's that? Look! A mound of earth... One closer inspection. A Monty mole! Hey, hey. Ha. No, no. Please leave me alone. I tricked you, Blll... I did it. What?.. Monty moles. I just defeated some and now they're I didn't need something like that. But okay. I think it works anyway. Oh, sorry. Now I got over the spikes. Oh no. Nasty Goomba. Hey, loose soil? Maybe you can dig deeper That's right. Maybe baby Yoshi has been That calls for Super Luigi! I still have these great shovels. With these shovels, and get deeper into the ground. Mario, dont worry. Your brother will support you no matter what happens. Luigi, Of course. I'll be there in a second. Hi Mario. Look, I've brought shovels. Alright, let's get started. Ok, but where should we start? Hmm. Maybe here in the middle. What do you think? Okay, let's give it a go. Let's dig deep. Aw, really exhausting. Hopefully we'll get deeper into the cave. I'm going to take a little break. Luigi, you have to help me. Aw, it's alright, it's alright. Somehow we can't get down into the ground. Oh, it's no use. We won't get any further. Thank you for your help, Okay, there's no time to lose. Oh no, nothing's working today. I'll go back then. Hey, that's actually. It's actually a red cannon. I wonder if it can shoot Alright, we'll aim it and off we go. We are on an earth planet. That's so interesting... And look at these huge earth towers. I think I need a drill. Hey Yoshi, do you have a drill for me? Shouldn't we try the shovel again? Jeez Luigi, no! We really need a drill. It's much quicker. Just a moment. My drill should still be And sure enough, there it is. Yes. Very nice. I've always used it to dig up fossils. But today it's supposed to help I've got the drill. I hope it gets you somewhere. Good luck. You know the drill. Awesome. Thank you very much for that. And now I can just drill my Okay. The only question is, First drill through here. Will that get me much further? No, I have to find another way... What about the other big Earth tower? Hmm. I would say let's find out. Let's give it a try first down here. That's strange... Okay, let's try again here. And let's drill into the ground. Oh, I actually got much deeper into the cave. But what are these strange crystals?.. Huh? What? What's going on now? Oh. Oh, that's terrible! Oh no, my brother. I have to support Mario quickly. We need a power up fast. But what? What could help him in this situation? Oh, an elephant fruit. That's right. That's the best power up you isn't it? Hey Mario, Luigi, why am I supposed to walk That won't help me at all. Oh. Hey, wait a minute. That just went well. I don't know why he brought I don't understand it at all. But the main thing is that we made it. Okay. Even deeper into the cave Wait a minute. Isn't the yellow Yoshi I think we are on a very hot track. Literally... Okay, watch out! Now we have to get past Watch out. I think I need a wall jump. That's my turn. Bye bye. Phew... That went well again. Hey, Baby Yoshi. Where are you? Where on earth are you? Show yourself. Fire breathing plants. I don't like that at all. And here? What do we have in here?.. What's in this question mark block? There is little baby Yoshi. Hey, where are you going? Hello, Mario. Thank you for coming to rescue me. I was so scared. Why are you glowing like that?
