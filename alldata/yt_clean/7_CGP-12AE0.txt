- [Jon] The but it's (dramatic sound) really long. - [Tim] Yeah, it's a collection of many books written over (bus engine humming) but altogether they - [Jon] So what's - [Tim] Well, it to a beautiful mind, (wind blowing loudly) a being called God. And he has the power of the uncreated world (birds whistling) and beauty, (hopeful music) - [Jon] And to God appoints these - [Tim] Or in Hebrew,'adam. - [Jon] and they're - [Tim] Which means (birds whistling) on God's behalf by harnessing all of its potential and creating even more beauty and order. (plants rustling) - [Jon] This is (popping sounds) (plants rustling) life-giving work. But the question is, &quot;How?&quot; - [Tim] Yeah, that's represented by a fruit tree. So humans could (wind blowing) and find freedom by trusting in his or they could seize power (thunder rumbling) on their own, which, God warns, will kill them. - [Jon] And they hear the voice (hissing) that tells them, &quot;The choice is simple. Take the fruit. &quot;It'll give you power and freedom to rule the world on your own terms.&quot; - [Tim] And so (dramatic thumping) and as a result they become suspicious (man and woman grunting) It leads to (man and woman yelling) violent power grabs, and, ultimately, (many people screaming) that has redefined evil as good. (lightning cracking) (wind blowing loudly) - [Jon] And, here, takes an important turn. We zoom into the story who come out of Babylon: Abraham and Sarah. - [Tim] Yeah, God will come a new people, a nation that has another chance (footsteps) and, if they succeed, it will open up (people talking happily) (whooshing sound) (birds whistling) of the Bible story is about this family. (many people talking) Despite God's personal guidance, Abraham's family gives in (hissing) to redefine good and apart from God. - [Jon] Even when their (coins jingling) rulers who loved God's guidance (people screaming) even they gave in. - [Tim] And so Israel was warned by their own prophets (men grunting and yelling) them back to Babylon, this time as conquered and that's exactly what happened. (lightning cracks) personal guidance, Israel fails. (thunder rumbling) - [Tim] Well, the prophets said (man grunting) God's going to send a new leader to Israel to cover for their failures (lightning cracks) the people's hearts and minds so that they can make the right choice. - [Jon] And so called the Old Testament ends, and these promises are left hanging. - [Tim] And then the (wind blowing) We're introduced to a man who comes from the line of Israel's kings: Jesus of Nazareth. And he said that he was bringing (footsteps) to their completion. - [Jon] He confronted that (hissing) that all humanity has given into (whooshing sound) - [Tim] And then he to rule the world (people talking) Jesus taught about God's and he said that real According to Jesus, it's and even love their enemies, (whooshing sound) who actually rule the world. - [Jon] And that's confusing but also really beautiful. - [Tim] And so is the claim that the story goes on that he is God become human to be for Israel, and for all humanity, (people screaming) for ourselves. (man grunting) He came to take the consequences and his sacrificial love (rock crumbling) - [Jon] So now humanity's presented with a new choice. - [Tim] Represented by a new tree. - [Jon] Stick with (thunder rumbling) (hopeful music) - [Tim] And in the story, those who choose the way of Jesus find themselves energized People who know that they can become people who love - [Jon] The Jesus throughout the world, (thumping sounds) of people who follow the way of Jesus. - [Tim] But they faced problems. (stones whooshing) (gasping) by people in power, and inside there was (hissing) - [Jon] Yeah, because - [Tim] And so called apostles, (hopeful music) and to challenge these communities to stay faithful to the - [Jon] And they're when Jesus will come (whooshing sound) by pointing to the future day when all wrongs are made right. (church bells chime) (whooshing sound) and humanity can rule the world together in the love and power of God. (bus hissing to a stop) So that's the story of the Bible, and it brings all of these books together. - [Tim] But what's interesting (bus engine roaring) a different kind of literature that contributes to this and that's what the next - [Tim] Hey, everybody, thanks for watching this This is part two of our How We've got a lot more and a lot more videos.
