- We are 20 days, 23 hours, and 30 minutes into the new &quot;Mystery Tech&quot; era, in case you're trying I was pretty close on that one. (package thumping) Why is it metallicy rattling? I don't think that's good. CharaChorder. &quot;As a CharaChorder owner, you have helped us take one step closer to achieving our mission to type at the speed of thought.&quot; - Oh, (beep). - Alright, great, I'm gonna hate this. Also, what a- - [Ken] That doesn't look (Ken laughing amusingly) - I'm very afraid that this is what my - So, I've seen this on TikTok, and this might actually piss you off more than any item that we have - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - That's not a keyboard, that is... Oh, good Lord! So, it's a bunch of joysticks. You go up, down, left, right. Ooh. - [Ken] Can you see how scuffed up it is, like straight outta the box? - Quality wise, it seems a little meh. Now to be fair, I think So, it's got one of those - [Matt] But, I don't - So, if you wanna have them separate, I think you can take it out of this. Like, you unscrew these screws here and you take off the metal support. - You can get pretty quick with this. It might be surprisingly 'cause he can't touch time. - Wait. - [Austin] Why is Matt sprinting? - The last time I saw it was because he got to go home. (everyone laughing relatably) - What is it? - [Austin] Oh no! - Yes! Yes, yes! - [Matt] Yes. - So, this was an early Actually, this was like This is a game controller, And essentially, you and then you can kinda Like, I hated this with a passion. This is almost worse. Can I have a laptop, so I 'Cause we all know where this is going, let's just speed this up here. I'm going to attempt to type. It's gonna be bad. First of all, lemme just and see what happens. So, if I go up- - [Jared] Do you wanna before you just go in this blind? - No. Well, I'm just typing. I just typed the word &quot;trun.&quot; U-T-O. (laughing amusingly) I'm typing weird words here. - So, there's combinations of gesture to get different letters. - If you go to their website, that should walk you through it. - Why would I take a class? You're trying to tell me that for this episode of &quot;Mystery Tech&quot;? - [Matt] Yeah, he didn't He didn't even go to high school. - [Ken] No, he did, he was at home. - And guess who's the boss? (everyone sighing unenthusiastically) I'm just typing &quot;ouo nono, ono ouo.&quot; - [Ken] I've heard that song before. - Okay, here... Okay. I will say, without a proper this is very difficult. One of my little nubbins - [Matt] It's crazy 'cause this is like the but also it requires so much effort. (Matt laughing amusingly) - This is like learning... What's a really obscure language? - [Matt] English, apparently. (everyone laughing amusingly) - Ow! This item is fairly cheaply made. You know, it's just which does not feel great. - [Matt] Oh, this is - Their build cost? Ah, $17. The actual cost of this? $179. - [Jared] This is $300. - [Ken] That's like a Steam - Sorry, I'm just gonna Do you have a piece of tape? Can we just... - [Ken] No return policies. - What? - Come with me, friends, as of mysterious technological - [Jared] I was really hoping you were saying you were flying because our next item involves the air. - The Nreal Air. I've seen people talk about these. As far as I know, they're that goes on your face. It's all in Japanese. I did not know that Nreal - [Jared] So, we had to import this. - [Austin] Really? - I don't know how - Everyone did sponsored videos, Jared. Everyone else got paid to do what we're doing for free right now. I don't know what I'm We've got our Nreal glasses, which do come in a nice so I'll give 'em that. We got a polishing cloth, we got a manual. &quot;Get to know your Nreal Air.&quot; So, we've got some like (upbeat rhythmic music) - [Matt] Okay. - This is what happens when you don't let me - [Matt] You did read the instructions! - We've got ourselves the glasses here, and oh boy, these are interesting. So, from the front, But, on the inside you, you can see what looks So, we've got ourselves So, if I put these on straight, Okay, how do I look? Do I look stylish and - [Matt] You look like you (Matt laughing amusingly) - You have to have an app, and then you also have - [Matt] Yes. - The USB-C plugs in It will work with lots Do I see a Pixel? Nope, don't work with no Pixel. My entire activation and setup process is running inside of the edge (gently chiming) Oh, I heard a Windows chime. - [Soundclip] My eyes! (Matt laughing amusingly) - That's bright. Ow. I was not ready for that. Okay, lemme try that again. So essentially, to kinda I would say the display is Okay, let's pull up a YouTube video. So, I'm gonna watch, &quot;This Is.&quot; Apple killed the So, what I'm seeing here is essentially a complete but in the glasses. Which means that it's very bright. The color, the clarity, the sharpness, I mean, it actually looks honestly better than the actual laptop. Like a 70-inch nice And the audio is also pretty decent. It sounds like Matt's You know what I bet this would 'cause you've got a really in a way that even though it feels much more akin to something like a really Rift display or Quest But, the difference is there's none of that kind of So, as I move around, the screen is staying exactly And also, the fact that Like, even though the I can kind of see through it a little bit, especially if I turn the brightness down. I can easily see all the But, as I turn it up, it pretty much sort of drowns But, anything that's slightly How much is this? - [Jared] So, that's the thing. We bought this before it was - Oh no. - [Jared] So, on Amazon When we had to import it, it was $460. - Okay, that's a lotta money. Even $380, I think is a But okay, okay, let's give it a fair shot. I'm gonna plug this in to a Okay, I'm now verified, my Nebula account. Oh, it's updating the glasses Oh well, (laughing gently) Also, the glasses have For $380, there's real potential here in using this as a head-mounted display that can give you some massive, like 100-inch display that's 1080p, clear, crisp. You've got audio built in. The problem is is that while all this AR I can't get it to work. So, did Ken just fall asleep? (Jared and Austin laughing amusingly) - I'm like so bored with this thing. (humming aggressively) - I'm just feeling in a wee mood. &quot;NightWatch, the dock that turns your What the... What? - [Matt] It already does that. - &quot;For all Apple Watch series.&quot; My BS radar is going off hard. Is this gonna be one of those - [Matt] It says it, &quot;Magnify the face.&quot; (Jared laughing amusingly) - I hate this already! Is it even a dock? &quot;Amplify the sound.&quot; What? What sound does the Apple Watch make? It is the NightWatch for You can magnify the face, parentheses, &quot;Charger not included.&quot; You can go 150 miles an Ferrari not included. Okay cool, thanks for - [Ken] What the (ooph) is that? Oh my god, they killed Daftpunk. (explosion blasting) Oh no, they're already dead, sorry. (Ken laughing amusingly) - Don't go there, Ken! Okay? If I hear you make One more One more time - [Ken] I'm gonna put them One more time (Ken laughing amusingly) - I'm gonna send you- Around the world - Oh, please do. (laughing amusingly) I wanna go back to Japan. Oh no, you mean Malaysia. - And you're gonna be forced the entire time. &quot;Open the Apple watch app, and then insert your charger in. When you slide the Apple Nightstand Mode will So, the problem with this is that, well besides the fact that your Apple Watch is not gonna stay on. There's no tech here, it's (deep rhythmic music) I hate this. It just looks dirty because like every little is now magnified. I mean, okay, I'm looking at it directly, it does make it bigger. - [Matt] You said it made it bigger? I'm gonna need to borrow that - How much was this? And if it's more than $19.99, you can just buy a regular alarm clock and be very happy with it. - [Jared] This was $85. (&quot;Spongebob&quot; music playing) - [Ken] Is that even real glass? - Who chose this item? - It wasn't me. - Um, God chose this item. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, that's the Oh wait, I know this one. There's a story behind this item. Before I even open it... Come closer. So, for this item, I was reached out to by a certain person who offered to pay me to I know. - [Ken] Is this a (ooph) screwdriver? - I did not take Linus' bribe money to be sponsored by lttstore.com. - [Ken] So, you were stupid - Oh (ooph), yeah you're right. Okay, let's take a look We've got ourselves the Standard Apparently, people are all screwed up It is very orange on the inside, we got a piece of paper, and - [Matt] Alright. - Ah, that sounds nice. So, you've got yourself your There are no bits, okay. The bits are somewhere. So, we've got the black and the silver shaft. This thing is not cheap. This is like what? - [Jared] $70. - That's more than I paid So, you've got a pretty good selection. You've got some Phillips, You've got a little magnet one, I will admit, I don't know 'cause it's a screwdriver. Oh, you know what I can do though? First of all... (sniffing screwdriver diligently) Cool. Second of all... (Screwdriver falling abruptly) I just had to Linus it. Let's take a look at the Creator Edition. We have... Ooh! There is a white base as - It's a PC I have to take apart anyways, so you're just gonna save the work for me. - You're can make me tear apart the... Oh, it's fine. That's fine, that's fine. I'll say it feels nice, and already loaded up in here, But, this has gotta be pretty - [Jared] So, I just did the math. - Yeah. - [Jared] It looks like to selling over 100,000 of these. - 100,000? - [Jared] 100,000. - That's a lotta screwdrivers! This feels solid and sturdy. But also, as someone who I'll admit I don't really care about If you're looking for I mean obviously this is well made. And if you were in the market, (sighing annoyingly) It's It's kind of a lot of money. So, this comes courtesy of a &quot;Hey guys, it's Alan I put in some more random gifts. I hope you enjoy.&quot; He also put his Twitter, There's actually a lotta stuff in here. So, we've got ourselves We also have something - [Ken] Oh, let's go! Okay, okay, you got me. - We got some nice sleeves. Oh- - Let's go! I saw that. Yay. &quot;White Cross.&quot; Oh, shoot! (laughing happily) Let's go! Oh dude, this is expensive. What the (ooph)? - They're Hololive cards. I didn't know these even existed. - Let's go! - And importantly, a &quot;Lost So, this is a lotta stuff. - I almost kinda feel bad. This is not cheap. (laughing happily) - So, thank you very much, Alan. Austin, Ken, and the rest of the crew, are now gonna start opening some stuff while we eat some delicious snacks. Look at these dope sleeves. We have enough sleeves Oh, there we go! - Wow. - Our Gold Galarian Articuno Okay, I'll take that. Oh, and a hyper rare Lychenroc. See, there we go! Thanks, Alan, for the terrific pulls. That's a sus looking box. Don't damage the table! - [Ken] It's already - So, this looks to be a Valve Steam Deck. A way to take all the and put it in something It doesn't smell like a Steam Deck because it's actually dbrand! So, is this the Killswitch? - [Ken] This is is - Okay, so I have seen this on Twitter, but have not paid any attention. (chill rhythmic music) Thanks, Jared. It's actually a nice kind of sort of grippy You've got like these kinda You have easy access to &quot;Warning, this is a magnetically Do not use as a handle.&quot; So... Oh. - [Ken] And it's keyed - Oh, it's keyed. - Yeah. Okay, okay, okay. Oh, that feels terrific. (item banging loudly) - Oh, God. I think the idea is that having their bulky case, or you could just throw this in - Oh! - [Matt] It is its own case. - [Ken] Yes. - But, it doesn't make it any Especially you take off the kickstand, you've got a hard actual This is actually pretty neat. So, you've got your little which look nice. Although, not like this (clearing throat gently) I am probably one of the least 'cause I know while everyone universally I prefer the Aya Neo entirely because the Aya Neo and this thing is larger than Ken's ego. (static crackling) Unfortunately, just a few hours after of &quot;Mystery Tech,&quot; dbrand had to pull the due to some issues with and some fans inside Steam Decks. But, everything I said still holds. This thing is cool once they, you know, swap it out and it starts (chill rhythmic music)
