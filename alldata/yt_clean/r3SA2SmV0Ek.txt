Hello and welcome (back) to my channel This candy roller is sitting in my workshop for quite a while It is deadlock and very very rusty I got it from a friends father He gifted it to me after he saw my videos I'm very thankful for that I was waiting for the right moment to restore it And this moment is now Spiders claimed this machine a while ago I would date it back to late 1800 early 1900 There is a nut missing here The handles shape is fully intact But the wood feels brittle I start with penetration oil It will loosen up the rust The rust pitting is deep. But evenly distributed I already know how to work with this to my benefit The strong clamps are essential to press the rolls together I drive down the stuck bearings to loosen them up Then I lever them out The rolls are made out of bronze The slides are also deeply pitted This whole built is so honest Every part serves a specific task And its only design feature is to serve this task No casing, just the bones I wonder if this grime is partly candy too The rivets have to come off I replace them later Ah dang I forgot about the crank Cant get this off I should have been more careful However there is a certain level of decay The wood is very brittle and light I start by sandblasting the rust away This time I go part by part in the video and not task by task I do this because there are so many nice parts Afterwards I file away all spiky cast marks I will add a threaded hole to screw in the handle cap I mark the center The rails seem to be hardened and forged... ...they hardly shows any pittings under the surface rust I clean them up with sanding net 240 grit With scotch brite I clean out the light pittings I mask this patina before the next step Sandblasting time I will not make it smooth It shouldnt look like its ordered on Wish... ...and entirely made out of plastic in reality Then this part is prepared as well I will powder coat because it goes best with hot sugar Originally it was most likely covered in lead paint I first prime the parts Afterwards RAL 3004 "Purple Red" Well thats a good result Next the base plate Same steps I clean with degreaser before powder coating As this base plate is flat it needs to get anice surface finish After coating I sand down with 800 grit RAL 6005 &quot;Moss Green&quot; mixed with &quot;Jet Black&quot; RAL 9005 Still not good enough I'll polish it up Sanding 1000-5000 grit Polishing with Cut 800-3500 Perfect Now those bolts will transform into something very special Complain in the comments if I dont keep my word I brush out the patina with the whire brush I recut the thread And I highlight the patina by adding a contrast finish After polishing I nickel plate To increase plating quality I add an air pump into the setup Air bubbles will remove gas bubbles from the surface This way I avoid disturbances It will improve the plating quality Here you see gas bubbles forming and sticking to the surface By moving it into the airstream The bubbles get carried away I'm confident you love it as much as I do Now I do the same with the clamps Only diffence they get fully shiny I spent more time on polishing. I will fast forward I dont know how I did that myself The bronze parts are delicate regarding the tolerances I treat them with a brass brush The shafts are cast iron I guess And at this moment I realized its for making candy cigars Please help me with the rebranding, I can't hand my nephew candy cigars I dont do bluing as those parts get in contact with hot sugar I will bake on a layer of linseed oil instead Its a good coating for this purpose Only now I realized its not metric thread Funny because all other threads are metric I make it metric since I want to make a new nut I have this steel from the coffee grinder Knurling the nut for better grip I also made some more parts I make new slides from stainless steel Luckily I restored a metal sheer It won me the restoration battle against my buddy Mister Patina Now I fix my mistakes from the past All of them I pre glue with Chestnut instant wood glue There is one old chipping I will fix First I make a flat surface Then I glue a piece of beech to it I metioned that the wood is very brittle One drop and it might brake completely I need to fix that I need a container of similar dimensions I choose this drug I fill it with epoxy resin I then will create a vacuum The air gets sucked from the inside of the wood Leaving little micro vaccum holes in the wood These holes are looking for a new tenant And this is when the resin that surrounds the wood... ...will move in and pay the rent That's why the wood is (financially) stable again Okay air came out, thats for sure Thats why I was seaching for a small container I now have to remove all the excess again Thats not sustainable its for the sake of keeping the original wood I'm aware of this, but I made this decision consciously And that was the last part Beer Test now in the end of each video So I continue with assembly Assembly is straight forward so I be quite If you have questions ask in the comments Marking for aligning the rolls Aaaaaaaaaand its done Before After Dont subscribe if you dont like it Because thats definetly the best I can do Otherwise please consider to subscribe :) I took too long candy mass is getting haaaaaard I need to hurry :D Crack test Everything is done So its time for a beer This time I test a "Tegernsee Spezial" Its brewed near Munich I will rate Entry, Aftertaste, Body... ...Colour, Bitterness, Acidity and Fizz... ...on a scale of 1 = bad till 6 = great. I rate one beer in each video The colour is a shiny yellow And the fizz is strong with this one Lets see how it tastes And here are the results
