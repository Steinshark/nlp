To me, God is cold. You could say that I think of It's just helping me. It's training me. It's bringing me back to the inner And there's a way I do not only endure, &gt;&gt; We live in a world where there's fake alternative medicine It's a rare moment in history when someone with real evidence to back them up. Wim Hof has defied logic time and time again, and He holds the world record for almost two hours without his He's climbed Mount Everest in nothing but run a marathon in the desert He's even proven in a laboratory setting that he can withstand illnesses But he's not a freak of nature. According to Wim, They just have to learn his method, Using a combination of cold immersion, anyone can accomplish feats that were &gt;&gt; The question is, &gt;&gt; Yes, I am able to train people a weeks time with a relatively make people be able to &gt;&gt; We were skeptical, so Wim invited us see just how easy it is We first met Wim on his where he began to teach our whole Growing up in the 21st century, we're naturally skeptical of But to put Wim's method to the test, Because no true miracle can be In this case, the miracle would supposedly our clothes and climbing to the top of But before that, our training So, while I'm climbing the mountain, if they haven't done the training, - Yes, and the film too. &gt;&gt; We are going to start You will see feeling is understanding. And later on we can dig in all readings and comparisons and You are going to feel it, we are pioneers. Okay, just go on. No thinking, just feel. Your head is becoming light-headed. &gt;&gt; Wim was going to teach us But first we had to learn the basics. Wim told us to spend one minute Then he instructed us to take By using his technique, much longer than usual. I didn't really know what was going on, my body was doing things it had never done But also very curious as to It was like I was going where instead of becoming an adult, &gt;&gt; First round, 2:17 for Matt. Crazy, yeah? - Whoa. You still? I just stopped because I wanted to listen. But I was still good. - Good. &gt;&gt; My whole body was just And then when you said to stop breathing, it just didn't seem like I had It was really amazing. Who are you? Who are you? I mean, I can't argue with the results. You've done things that no But there have been hundreds of the past 4,000 years who have claimed by controlling their body, using What makes you different? Is it that you're the first &gt;&gt; Absolutely not the first But I am the first one to to take away the speculation around it. &gt;&gt; What was your life like &gt;&gt; Actually, I was a father of four Because my wife accidented in 95. So that kind of adversity and sadness maybe motivated you to... - Oh yes. Inspire yourself in the same way Yes, sadness is a deep trigger. Where I got peace was in Swimming outside in the cold. The cold is merciless, &gt;&gt; So, Wim's just told me to get into because it means we're Wim's already shirtless. &gt;&gt; Scared shirtless. Scared shirtless. Just chill out, man. &gt;&gt; All right, yeah! &gt;&gt; Oh, boy. &gt;&gt; Let nature go within you. Breathe, motherfucker! &gt;&gt; That is some cold Amsterdam Keep on, silently, witness, witness, witness. You're doing just fine. You're going the way I I don't feel cold at all. I feel like if you keep relaxed and you stay in there you could do it Look at this madman. So now our producer has to go in as well because she's gonna need to be there when we do this. So good luck, Casey. &gt;&gt; You can come in too. There you are. Hello, take it easy. You know people think I'm crazy. Maybe I am crazy. But not because of my Not because of my cold water swimming. Not because of my being The first time I went under the ice, I saw this as a big, huge, sharp diamond. At 35 meters I lost sight I couldn't see nothing. I couldn't breathe, of course. And then my consciousness succumbed This is survival. I do not fear death. I fear not to live fully. If I live fully, I am not into death. I am living. &gt;&gt; It isn't all about breaking records. Wim's mission is to use to revolutionize our In 2011, in an experiment that challenged our In normal humans, the injection should to fever, chills, and headaches. But not in Wim. It appeared that he was somehow able to his body secrete adrenaline, suggesting that his method can allow us Scientists thought he might So to further prove this theory, they performed this same experiment on And the same thing happened. &gt;&gt; Normally, it's very difficult to increase your Adrenaline is released by And autonomic means that you So if you walk outside and you are robbed rate of 160 and your blood pressure But if I ask you now to increase You cannot voluntarily modulate that. And with the techniques of Wim Hof, increase his adrenaline levels even higher than people that go That was something that we didn't &gt;&gt; If we learn to influence we could potentially use that to treat system is overactive, including Crohn's But Wim didn't seem to think that there could accomplish, and He was eager to show that he could help So he invited us to dinner a famous philosopher of science, who had taken up the Wim Hof method &gt;&gt; I don't think Wim is a wonder worker, - Miracle. &gt;&gt; A miracle worker. I want to forgo that people who have think that they're off their cancer next week. That's not a fact, but &gt;&gt; So this really is kind of It's science that we are testing now. It's science we don't yet we know that it has &gt;&gt; Yes, and if this immune system is or that we can influence our that the immune deficiency And the results are hopeful, but &gt;&gt; Everything that Wim does is based nature and accomplishing the things that &gt;&gt; As soon as you put the exercise in the religion and spirituality and science, Religion, spirituality and science are circling about something Train your body, man. As a human, what has this done for you? &gt;&gt; I'm not easily convinced, something that gives me some You have a life expectancy of two months, Maybe it's the same with I would like to be And when there is really something that makes me feel better, it's... - Very satisfying. It was very satisfying. It was very satisfying. Please, let nobody who see's this into control and then drive onto I don't like this speech of conquering But when you get something to do and which you can do and Some feeling of control comes back and &gt;&gt; Hypothetically, if research came back methods weren't working, there was some other factor that accounted for What would that make you feel? &gt;&gt; I'm okay. You know, And I don't want to give any false So, I'm into science, but that needs only the commitment of a person to make it work within just a day or You will be able to go learn to control the immune system, the hormonal system, the muscular system, All that, into the inner power which we all have. &gt;&gt; We traveled to Poland for the next step with us climbing Mount Sniezka in our In Amsterdam, we had our first little But for us to really get into he's invited us here, This is where he trains including the 12 scientific test subjects to suppress their immune &gt;&gt; Control. No hocus pocus just the magic Make it work guys. Control into your brain. Nobody else's, no blah blahs, Deeply in, let me go. &gt;&gt; Faster. Okay, count down. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Good. It's really bizarre to be in are tripping out from breathing. You get these tingly sensations it feels like everything's vibrating. And then you get kind of And for me that was it. You cried. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Mine was so weird. All my hands were like this. They just locked and Then I just cried and cried and I wasn't thinking about anything sad, &gt;&gt; It's hard to talk about it when I first did the breathing, I'm so happy, I just want to get up and I love you, I love all of you. And I guess that's how you &gt;&gt; I was amazed to see some of What's happened when people have &gt;&gt; What we do, we are going deeply into and what appears, people begin to cry or Whatever is hidden deeper these techniques make it &gt;&gt; I guess it's kind of similar relive past trauma and &gt;&gt; We do not need psychotherapy. Fuck off! Just let it breathe in. Just bring back the control Connect back with the body. This time we are able to cleanse it all. All of the people say, yeah, you cannot and yeah, it's part of life, and Fuck fate, and fuck destiny and all that. No, this time we learn to control and that's not philosophical or sectarian. It's chemistry. &gt;&gt; Do you ever get any who never really succumb to the cause? &gt;&gt; I have a very good example of that. Scott Carmen is He came from America to this the charlatan business and The charlatan and the crap, when he converted into hey, And he was standing with us And now he wants to write a book and &gt;&gt; Make a big circle, big circle. It may look like a Pentecostal ceremony long enough, it's normal to experience It's more difficult to imagine how that to stand out in the snow for an hour. Maybe, like in the immune response test, But whether it was some ancient secret of endurance and mental focus, it seemed that My suspicion was that the secret was And just being in his presence was would've normally done. You're getting into some pretty although it sounds kinda out there, It's scary slash amazing at the same time. &gt;&gt; I don't know where, but And I didn't even notice that I It was really amazing. &gt;&gt; It's just something In the east part of the world, it's in In the western part of the world, &gt;&gt; Enlightenment is a form of happiness profound as people imagined it. &gt;&gt; I had a thing called Crohn's I've been to detox centers and on lots of different A lot of them are quite new age and At least Wim Hof has been working with advanced hospital research, You've seen him on the Guinness Book an ice cube for two hours. &gt;&gt; So what's going on? &gt;&gt; We are filling the torches with gas, we are going to the waterfall later on, &gt;&gt; Wim's method would never have his business savvy son, Enahm whose an app and a global brand. I sent him some news when I was in Tanzania. Enahm, I've been looking around here, far places where I'm getting, &gt;&gt; Yeah, as big as me, yeah. &gt;&gt; You are still the greatest. The greatest asshole. &gt;&gt; The Wim Hof method did It was an Iceman doing a trick So, Iceman is a superhero. Nobody can be as the Iceman, because its Wim Hof is a person like everyone else, to attract the attention to show the whole than thought of, so I thought that's a beautiful goal. To bring that back to the people. And yeah, I've started doing the platforms I saw the things already from my So I trusted it. &gt;&gt; How much of this came out of &gt;&gt; Everything started there. Because my Mom was psychotic. They consented her with 11 personalities, It was always my Dad being there for us. They stuffed her up with pills And she committed suicide. So that was the beginning of my Dad Where lies all these problems? So he went challenging himself. You know if you don't have an answer, you're going to find yourself an answer. I know where I came from, from a valley. It's like a trauma. She jumped from eight floor. That's my grief, I loved her to death. But the world is huge, much, it's the money. It's very difficult to bring this to So science in time now will take it on and &gt;&gt; Everyone's about to participate in They hold the torch to represent Yeah, it might look a little bit I don't think this is a cult, but if he gave me any poison to drink &gt;&gt; Five. Four. Three. Two. There you go, one. There we go all in and let them go. I am going to tuck you in. &gt;&gt; I love being tucked in. We're so cute. The group had gone and Daisy and I werenleft with our own personal iceman trainer. In the lead up to climbing Mt.Snezka, we were gonna need all the extra help we could get. &gt;&gt; That was so weird. That was at the trippiest it's been. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you get eventually, but it might just be depriving I don't know if that's good. Maybe. &gt;&gt; Here is the summit, in snow and ice, and just in shorts. This is what I did before, on Mt.Everest. I was up till here, in shorts. Coming from 5,200 to 5,800, 6,400, 6,700, 7,500, 700. Over here I was. &gt;&gt; He walked up Mt.Everest in his shorts. What have you done with your life? We've just done the fun part of the Wim the breathing exercises and now it's time for Which is stripping down to our shorts and The waters running so the temperature is below freezing. That means this is pretty much So we've just come out of I cannot tell you how cold it was. It was the coldest water I can't feel my toes at all. To each one of my toes, the toe next to it Cuz I just can't feel them. You just start to think fight or I need to get out of this water. This is not where humans are meant to be. &gt;&gt; [FOREIGN] You know nothing about Poland! &gt;&gt; Obviously, you have your mission, But I have to ask, is it not also being able to say I climbed &gt;&gt; If I can use it, I use it all the time. Too many are records. Too many of them have given My unrestfunless deeply within, So, I gotta solve this, until its I think the king and the queens, The thing about that, you are able to distinguish - See you're doing that thing you always do, when I'm really into It's filled with beautiful metaphors. I'm ready to accept you as my leader. And then you say something I What is an electromagnetic halo? Oh, that's just your nervous Yeah, okay. I'm following you now... then you got a nice electrical &gt;&gt; Do I have any kind of aura? &gt;&gt; Yes, you got. &gt;&gt; Really? What's it doing? &gt;&gt; What does it look like? &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Its coming, its coming! &gt;&gt; No, no, fuck you! Its already there man. You're the king, &gt;&gt; Well done, today. And tomorrow even better. Nature calls us. And Mother Nature says I Because of a powerless situation of grief and emotion and now I've got the power. And now, I want to take away and all the diseases, almost all the diseases, we are able to learn to prevent them Because we are able to have which goes far deeper than ever thought. Boom, I'm gonna show the world of being powerless to have &gt;&gt; We just stayed in that freezing And the craziest part is I It must be the adrenaline or By standing in there and you don't feel the cold. I could stand out here for a while. But I'm not going to because I might die. &gt;&gt; Right now, We go up to 1400 meters, that's the Kopa. From the Kopa we'll go to the Snezka, And so all you have studied, And now just, don't think, but focus. Trust your body to be able to go with the And with that you are going to show for &gt;&gt; If you ever wanted a real test If you concentrate hard enough, you just feel like you're at the beach. &gt;&gt; Exactly. That's the mind. If your mind is on it, then you're quite Yeah, cause it is a bit nippy really. Hey. [FOREIGN] There's a method to this. What I'm doing is breathing in more oxygen than I need and then I'm breathing out without fully letting go. Doing that five times and on the final breath squeezing head, and that creates either real or And then you let go. And that's how we get to Oh shit! My crampons! Minor crampon emergency, it's fine. There a few theories as to why One is that he has a higher level brown fat, in his body, which is Studies have shown that people have higher levels of brown fat. So it's possible that he's able brown fat in his body by exposure to Another theory is that he's able to through breathing and Then that adrenaline allows him to Another theory is that he uses the Tibetan Tummo meditation, which by your metabolism gets redirected It's probably a combination some as of yet unexplained But Wim takes it a step further. He says that using his method, actually control your own autonomic I went through the scientific and put me to the test and But then they said you are the Ice Man, I said, no, what I can do, anybody can do. &gt;&gt; You can just start you can modulate your Stress are able to modulate There are many diseases that And you can imagine that it would modulate that immune response and that it might be of benefit for &gt;&gt; How did it feel when you finally got your methods work? &gt;&gt; I cried. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; You know what happens when your wife You don't understand, You have no power anymore. And finally, because you have how to silence the grief, that's the time when you break. That's the time when you can relieve. That's the time you can let go. It's when you cry. &gt;&gt; Look at the clouds. &gt;&gt; Wow, mother holy mama. It's nice, huh? &gt;&gt; It's amazing what the body can do when &gt;&gt; Yes, to its natural ability. &gt;&gt; We 'vecrossed the border from Poland just about to summit the tallest mountain Hello there. All the way. Good. &gt;&gt; How are you feeling? &gt;&gt; I'm feeling good. Once again, back home. &gt;&gt; One of the reasons it's been so Wim to get his method accepted is that it's inimical to our society's Wim's figured out a way to without the use of pharmaceuticals. And that could have big ramifications for Whether it can be used to cure actual This is the frontier of science, so it might be many years before we We came into this with a heavy dose of able to comfortably climb a freezing Wim gives people a chance to take back And for illnesses, that kind of What's the final stage in your mission? &gt;&gt; Final stage is go back to the grief. Go back to the love, the lost love. I want to bring back love to the world. Love is compiled by happiness, If you radiate good energy happy, and strong, that's love. Breathe! It's for free! It's life! It's good! Take em in! If you need to breathe you take em in and blow your mind. Come on. It's natural drugs.
