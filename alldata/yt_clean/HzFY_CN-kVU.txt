I think that was a very painful negotiation. Crazy. Sunday market. This next stop that we're about to go to, another wholesale contact of ours. 1 million is your.. Asking price. Full tray of speedies. I didn't put my makeup on. I'm not getting the good deals today. Give me the best price. It's not winding. I'll take it, okay? So it's a good example, but the price is a bit too high. Next time we come, we're going to be banned. It's a (Rolex) Polar Explorer 16570. These are very typical. We find like hundreds of these every single day. But sometimes what we find, especially S-serials in 94, 95, they develop a really, really beautiful patina. And this one has that. So it has a really beautiful patina on the dial and hands that match perfectly, that glow evenly under UV as well. So the money is in the dial. Like even if the case is terrible, you're not paying for the case, you're paying for the dial for this watch. Yeah. So at the right price, I'm happy to buy this. Yeah, but it has to be right. Because these days, the prices for these watches have dropped a lot. Yeah. And if we buy too high, we're going to be stuck with it. No matter how beautiful it is. So they're asking... They're asking 50 even for this watch. I might try lowball them. I want to end up around... I want to end up around this. But I think I'll start with this as an offer. Just to see. Yeah. What do you reckon? Yeah. It's very important to check the condition of the dial and hands to make sure that everything matches. It's really, really nice. It's really good. So the dial and hands match perfectly. Hasn't been color matched. Hasn't been altered. It's original. It's S-serial as well, which is very, very good. So this could be a buy. Let's try. Let's try and make a deal. Can I pay 45000? Can we try? Because the condition's not very good. And very short. It's for a lady's wrist. Can we try? 48000 is the lowest. 48000 is the lowest? I can't get to 48000. Can we try a bit? Can we try a little bit? Can we meet somewhere? 45500? No, under cost.. Yeah? I need a bit better. I can't, I really can't pay 48000. I think 45500 is reasonable. I'm buying the, I'm buying back dials at 43000 already. All right, we're not having luck with the ladies. So we're going to try our favorite man, Daniel. The ladies are too hard on me. I didn't put my makeup on, so I'm not getting the good deals today. Daniel. 45500. Why 45500? Because I think that's a good number. I cannot 48000. 46000? I think 46000 is good. Strong. No good, lose money.. Apparently everyone, everyone loses money here. No one makes money. Everyone loses money. If you give me my price I make money Meet me closer. Meet me closer. I cannot 48000. So we meet somewhere. We don't want to make Daniel cry, do we? What should we do? The man's already told me his cost. I can't disrespect him, right? That's a good, it's a good strategy. All right, just 500 discount, okay? I'll take it. Okay, okay. You give me 500, then profit. No, no, no, I don't, I don't worry about the profit. Whether it's 1,000, 10,000, it's okay. My profit is only 500. Oh, okay. Let's, let's take it, all right? You know, you know, we, you know, we always, we always like to do a bit of business, so. I check I check.. It's all right. Don't forget this. This is extra 20 Hong Kong. Next time we come, we're going to be banned. Banned from the store. Yes. Crazy, right? It's okay, Daniel, don't think too much. It's too early. We have a long day ahead. Oh Nat, I'm lucky I checked. It's not, it's not winding. Need service. Let me check. It's not winding, needs service. Daniel, it's not winding, check. Check, it's not winding. It's okay, I'm nice. I'll still keep my offer. All right, I'll fix it. It's okay, leave it with me. Not winding, right? I have to service. I wish I can tell that to my client. No, no, no need to wind. Special, special Rolex. So the watch is not, the watch is not winding. It's not working properly, need to service. So we're going to take that into account when we price these things as well. So we started at 50,000. The offer's now 47500. Right? Which, remember this, I told you, is essentially what we want to pay. But, needs service. So service minimum plus mainspring, it's probably going to be at least 2,500. So it's going to end up being around 50,000 with a service. But we have to service it because we can't sell a broken watch to a client, right? Not working. Did you tell him it's not working? Did you tell him it's not working? So price is firm at 48,000. Price is firm at 48,000. Which, look, it's a little bit higher than what we wanted to pay. It's still a nice watch. I think I'm still going to buy it. That's still a good price. I'll take it, okay? Thank you. Let's get out of here, yeah? So we bought this. Beautiful watch. Oh, nearly fell out of the pouch. We just got this beautiful Explorer II, the patina dial one. Really, really nice dial. Yeah, so I think this would be a very good watch for our stock. It does need some cleanup. We do need to polish it. Actually, no, we don't need to polish it. We probably need to overhaul it, service it, maybe change a mainspring. So that might take some time, probably a month or two before it becomes presentable for us to sell. But it's a very good stock. It's very hard to find dials like that. So overall, very happy. All right? Cool. Datejust. This whole tray, all two-tone (Rolex) Datejust. Entire tray. Look. I think we can stock a couple of diamond dial ones. But we still have quite a lot of Day-Date. This is Datejust. Oh, Datejust, sorry. Yeah, but we also do have a lot of Datejust. Yeah. But we don't have that many ladies' size. True. Many men's size. Take a couple of ladies' ones. So if we find one... I haven't seen this configuration before with only two diamonds. Interesting, huh? Yeah. Some of these are quite nice. This must be a good condition. Quite nice. This is a good pile. You have really, really beautiful ladies' Datejust. There's a really nice 31 as well. This is actually super nice. I like that one. More Daydates. Well, the condition of these are actually overall quite high. Very good condition. We're looking for a diamond dial if possible. Diamond sells better than non. That's another one. Another good condition. There's super cute little Yachtmasters. These have really fallen out of favor, but I think they're quite nice. There's a super nice Mother of Pearl one as well. Oh, look at this one with rubies. Crazy Full tray of (Omega) Speedies. But nothing really for us. It's a cute one. Okay, thank you. Good luck today, okay? See you tomorrow. Thank you. Bye-bye. This next stop that we're about to go to, again, another wholesale contact of ours. We've dealt with them before, right? We have, we have. We've bought with them many, many times. I've known them for years. And they used to just sell Rolex, but now they've changed their stock to a little bit more interesting pieces as well. So there's some like Cartier, some Piaget. More of the stock that we're interested in. Yeah, that we're trying to buy for stock at the moment. So let's go see, have a look. We did already see some stock list and there was a Piaget in there that was really, really nice that I might do a negotiation on. And also he told me that he's got a very special Cartier for me as well. That's very interesting. He's probably going to give me a hard time on price, but he's got my attention. I'll find the the box for you. Yeah, okay. Okay, thank you. This is nice. It's interesting, right? I don't know if I can sell this. It's quite an unusual design, but it's interesting enough for us to stock. Yes, similar. This is quite interesting actually, this watch. Yeah, full set, right? I haven't seen a Piaget like this before. It's got a really beautiful tiger eye diamond dial with this unique woven texture on the case. 18 carat yellow gold with original buckle, strap, original box, wallet and paper. Yeah. That's a full set. The only thing is price. We're going to see if it's a good deal. ****'s always fair to me. What's the one price for this watch? No negotiation. Give me the best price. Yeah, 310,000. 310,000. Yeah, 310,000. That's your best, huh? Yeah. And you're always fair to me, so I'm not going to break your balls. And I'm happy with that. Yeah, I'll take it. Thank you. All right? Thank you. Cool. That's a very happy deal. Yeah. Nice. I never take the first offer, you know that? Yes. Always negotiate. But ****'s too nice to me. He's the best. So if he tells me it's his best, it's his best. Yeah. I trust him. Okay, so that's a nice pickup. Good job. Glad we got that. What about this? All right. Now, this is the watch that's going to be a bit more interesting, I think. We might have to do a little song and dance with this watch. So it's a Cartier Tank Louis Extra Flat. I know you've had this for a while. Yeah. I messaged you about this watch maybe a few months ago, right? That's our negotiation tactic. You know it's been here for a while. Let me look at it first, just to make sure it's a good one. How is it? It's really good, actually. It's quite clean. The dials on these typically crack. They have like a surface lacquer that cracks with age. But this one is very good. I can't see any visible marks, visible cracks. It's an early 70s dial with Paris at six o'clock. It's got Pointed A insignia. It's got a no secret signature. So it's quite an early extra flat model. The crown is also very good. There's no chips or anything in the cabochon. Case condition appears to be slightly polished before. Some of the engravings are slightly rounded. But that's okay. It's not too bad. There's an issue though. It doesn't have the original buckle. Yeah. So typically these come with like a deployant buckle, which is solid gold. Same as the one we have. Exactly. Yeah. Or if it's a tang buckle, at least it's gold. This one's not. And this one's just a plated buckle. So that's going to affect its value. Are we able to source one? Yes, but it costs money, right? Yeah. The original buckle, deployant buckle is around a thousand minimum. Thousand five. Yeah. All right. Is this running fine? Yeah. Working well? Yeah, of course. Has it been serviced already? Because this was your retail stock, right? Yeah. So serviced? I think the battery has been replaced, I guess. Yeah. Okay. So it's running fine. Runs fine. Okay. But watch only, right? Yeah. Watch only. And no original buckle. Yeah. Just this buckle. Yes. Okay. What's your best on this? I think the best time... What I told you last time, I think it's 1.1 million. JPY. Let's see. You can give me an offer if not too far. What if it is far? If it is far? Can we still give you the offer? Yeah, but 1.1 (million) is in Japan, right? Yeah. It says here your USD price is what? 6300? 6300, yeah. US? So that's like what? 960,000 or something? 960,000? 960,000 under cost. 6300 USD to... 1 million, right? 6300 yeah. So probably without tax, right? Okay. Yes, 1 million. 1 million is okay. Right. Well, 1 million is your asking price. 1 million is okay. Yeah, right. Okay, let me think. 1 million. And if we were to buy watches like this, do you prefer Japanese yen or Hong Kong dollars or USD? You do transfer? Up to you. Cash or transfer. What's best for you? What's going to get me the best price? I think transfer is the best for you. Transfer is the best for you as well? Yeah, of course. It's good for me, yeah. Japanese yen is best? Japanese yen, yeah. Okay, right. Yeah. I understand, all right. If that's the case, let's try to do a deal. Let me see. So we can both save a bit. Will you take 920,000? 920,000. Transfer in Japanese yen. I cannot do that. Cannot? Cannot do that. Very far? Yeah. Or pretty close? Very far. Yeah? 1 million is almost the best I can do. What is the best? 1 million. You said almost the best. Okay, okay. Why your English is so good? Where did you learn your English? I didn't learn English. Hey, stop flirting. Stop flirting with ****. I'm trying to help you get a better price. He knows, he knows. 990,000. 990,000? Yeah, 990,000. Wow. That's pretty much just **** shouting us lunch. All right, I think... You know, with Cartier, it's a bit difficult at the moment. I want to give you an offer. I think it's quite fair. I want to offer you 950,000. 950,000. You cannot do that. Under cost. Really? Yeah. Even 950,000 is under cost? Yeah. So you're very, very tight. Yeah. Keep trying. Find out what's his cost. Everybody needs to make money. We don't want to... Again, we don't want to make... We don't want to make **** cry, okay? Everybody needs to smile, needs to laugh. Yeah, give me a bit better. I think we're close. 950,000, 990,000. I think we're okay. In fact, my boss told me the price I write in the bag. Yeah. That one was the best. My boss told me. Right, right. I understand. But we can give you Japanese yen. It's going to save you a bit. Yeah. Yeah. But it's already the best. So I do another for you. 990,000 maybe the best. A bit more. I cannot do that. Just a bit. I cannot do that. 5,000? Another? You know, 950,000, 990,000. I think it's okay, right? So somewhere in between. 985,000 maybe best. Really? Really? Okay, let me try. I think we're going to... We're close, but at 985,000, it doesn't make me want to buy it, you know? So let me try. What about one price 9.... 7......5......? The boss has spoken. Difficult. Hey, I didn't want to even offer that. I want it to be at 950,000. If you want 975,000, I mean, we're a team, right? I can't take that back. 975,000. Yeah, look, Natalie is the... She's the boss, okay? She's the undercover boss for me, okay? So if she says 975,000, that's a formal offer from us. Please. It is really the best I can do. My boss told me to do it to 1 million, you know? So yeah. Yeah, that's the best I can do now. But your boss is going to be happy that you sold this. It's been sitting for months. What do you think, Nat? Please, just try it. I can't, I can't, I can't. Sorry. All right, let me... Okay, let me try a different calculator, okay? The first calculator didn't work, so I need to change another calculator app to see if we can make it work. Yeah, look, you know what? Honestly, and this is not just me saying this, but it's a bit high for us, honestly. But with that being said, I really appreciate your help, you know, especially with the little things that we need and things like that. So we really appreciate that. And we want to do a bit of business every single month, right? And you know, we're always buyers for interesting Cartier, interesting Piaget, things like that. And we appreciate you sourcing these watches for us. So 985,000 we'll take it. Happy? Yeah. Happy? Okay, cool. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. All right, goodbye. We just finished up with our Japanese friends. Yes. They're always so nice, right? I almost feel bad negotiating with them. Yeah, very cute guys. They're too nice, yeah. Very friendly. But look, first of all, they're very special watches. Yes. That Piaget with the... Tiger eye. Tiger eye dial and diamonds as well. And it's a full set, full set of box papers, amazing set. The price that he gave us was already too good. Like I can just buy that for stock. Yeah. So that was a good buy. That's why I didn't negotiate at all. Yeah, you're right. And look, that's actually a very good point. Sometimes when a deal is good enough. Yeah. Then there's... If you can make it happen. Yeah. If we can still stock it, if we can still find the right client, still make money. Yeah. There's not much point negotiating. Yeah, everyone needs to eat.
