You understand why I love myself, - Right. I looked great. All three generations are the same. Hee Chul's grandfather - His grandfather was like that? This happened He showed me pictures of himself He said, - How about you? Do you think your wife liked you more? For two years... - You met her three times. - I met her on a blind date. I married her You met him 3 times for 2 years? He was in Seoul, - and I was in the countryside. - So you met 3 times for 2 years? You got married... - after meeting him 3 times?

I got married in 1979. - How long has it been? 45 years. We've been dating for 45 years. For 45 years. Is that true? It's a lie. (We're still dating.) The one who is from the countryside - So I got to love her... - after I met and married her. So you met her, married her, and Dong Gun was born, (He met her, married her, Dong Gun - That's right. (Dong Gun was born &quot;Dong Gun was born - Jong Kook. Rather than marrying someone you can love someone That's how it is. So I can love her later? You should get married first? After you get married... and have a baby, Did you also get married first... before you loved her? I married her because I loved her. Then why are you telling me I married her because I loved her. Then why are you telling me... - to get married first? When you marry someone, You can switch the order - Fall in love... after getting married. I think that's hard. - I got married when I was 35. But it doesn't work like that. Did you marry her... - because you loved her? When they introduced her to me... When did he love me? I don't know about that. (Shy) Of course. I took a liking and got closer. I wouldn't have married her - You loved her? (I loved her a little.) He loved her a little. (Little love is still love.) I want to ask Chung Su Did she like you more? Or did you like her more? (Which one fell harder?) I think I liked her more. I think I liked her more. (Surprised) - Really? I don't know about that. He said he married you I married him - During the trip, - I talked about my mom a lot. My dad is a romantic. So it got me curious. - Should I put you on the phone? Just say, &quot;I love you, honey.&quot; Just say that you enjoyed the trip. (Curious) Put the phone closer. Hello. I love you, honey. Oh, my. What's the matter? - Are you drunk?

That's nice. - Why? - Mom. - I got it. I'll text you later. - Okay. She would've said she loved him Why did you hang out? I felt shy. (Their sweet conversation (Jong Duk should call his wife too.) Kyeong Hwan. Mr. Heo. Let's see what she says (He suddenly looks serious.) - He became serious. - Yes. Can't you hear it? - Just say it. I've never said that in my life. My mom's response is important too, Please say you love her just once. - &quot;I love you, honey.&quot; I think I didn't say it Kyeong Hwan, you call her... - Dad. &quot;Honey.&quot; - It's so random. &quot;you know I love you, right?&quot; - Hello. - I'm finished now. - You're finished now? - I see. - What?

When he said, &quot;I love you, honey,&quot; - she was like, &quot;Pardon?&quot; &quot;Pardon?&quot; - It was out of nowhere. It got me so surprised. I even asked him if he was drunk. - Just... - By the way, I've never said it in my life. I've never said it either. Don't worry. (What will she say when she hears I hope she doesn't pick it up. I'm serious. I've never said it in my life, so she won't be able It will make her emotional. She might... cry by herself... because she's touched. He thinks she might cry. That's what you wish for. He thinks... - she might cry by herself. I was strict all my life. - Even to my son... - is unavailable. (The person you have reached He thinks she'll be touched. - And she might cry. - she'll say nothing. - Because she's touched? - Because it's surprising. No. Let's see.

She didn't cry at all. Even a married couple He has a way with words. Did he really say he loved you Yes. He rarely said it. Did he say that I don't think he said it (She never heard him He can't even call me honey. That's because you're still dating. Is that why? Until when are you going to date? It's played right away. (He's the only one who is serious.) (He looks so worried.) He's worried. Chung Su looks pale. &quot;Should I do it too?&quot; If I say it to her, - Still...
