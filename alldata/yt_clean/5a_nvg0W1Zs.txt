Hey everyone, I'm and I'm super excited for Today, we'll be learning and should, and how to I remember when I was learning Spanish, I was so confused by the in Spanish that I was afraid to use them, so I ended up sounding like a cavewoman. And I don't want that for you. That's why today's lesson is so important, and why I'm so excited to share with you how to use could, would, Okay, so let's get started. The first thing we'll learn today is just the basic meanings of and how they can be used Let's start with the word could. The word could is used to talk about possibility, so exciting. We might use the word &quot;You could be a doctor,&quot; or, &quot;You could be a lawyer,&quot; or, &quot;You could be an artist.&quot; The word could, it's full of possibility. Okay, let's move on to the word would. The word would is used to For example, we might say, &quot;You would be an excellent doctor,&quot; or, &quot;You would be a terrible lawyer,&quot; or, &quot;You would be an incredible artist.&quot; The word would is used to focus on what we see in our imagination. Okay, so now let's move The word should is often or to talk about the So for example, we could say, or, &quot;You should be a lawyer,&quot; or, &quot;You should be an artist.&quot; We could also use the word &quot;You should follow your dreams,&quot; or, &quot;You should choose a job or, &quot;You should be the change The word should is used to give advice or talk about the Okay, so let's go over that one more time. The word could is used to We might say something like, &quot;You could follow your dreams.&quot; The word would is used to talk about the way that we imagine &quot;You would be an incredible &quot;You would be an incredible And the word should is used to give advice or to talk about the For example, &quot;You should &quot;You should try to live in the moment.&quot; Now we know how to use the Let's take this a little further. Let's talk about how to use could have, would have, and should have. These are all ways to talk about the past. Let's start with could have. Could have is a way to talk We might use could have &quot;I could have traveled the world, &quot;but I decided to study instead,&quot; or, &quot;I could have become famous &quot;if I would have practiced more.&quot; Sometimes when you use you're also talking about a regret, like, oh, I could have become famous. But not always. You can also use could &quot;I could have become a lawyer, &quot;but I decided to become Could have is used to just what you could have done in the past. All right, so now let's Would have is a way to imagine the past. It's kind of using our We might use the word would &quot;I would have invited you to the party &quot;if I knew that you were in town,&quot; or, &quot;If I would have &quot;I would have been there for you,&quot; or, &quot;I would have read that book &quot;if I'd had it at the house.&quot; Would have, this is a way what you would have done. Okay, so now let's move on to should have. Should have is a way of or talking about the correct For example, I could say something like, &quot;I should have gone to bed earlier,&quot; or, &quot;I shouldn't have stayed up so late,&quot; or, &quot;I should have practiced Should have is talking about the correct way to do things in the past. Let's talk a little bit or even the word should. You probably have a talking about what they should have done, or what you should have That person is probably And that's because a constantly say should have done this, they're judging the present moment and they're wishing things were different. I personally prefer to have no regrets. I prefer to live in the moment and to accept things as they are. And so that's why I think to use the words should and so that we're not constantly and thinking you should or judging ourselves and thinking you should know more English words. I also want to tell you a little bit about a new saying that It's relatively new and it goes like this, &quot;Don't should all over yourself,&quot; or you can also say, And so essentially, this is a play on the words don't shit all over yourself, or don't shit all over me. It basically means don't judge So don't should all all over yourself just and just accept me for who I am, or accept yourself for who you are. Okay, so that's my little soapbox speech about and why I prefer to use Okay, so that does it for today's lesson on could, would, and should, and could have, would I hope you enjoyed today's lesson as much as I enjoyed teaching it.
