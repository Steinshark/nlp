Welcome to Sad Boyz, a podcast - I'm Jarvis. Why are you doing that robotic thing? - Just like usual. I'm just a natural looking guy. Haven't been replaced with an android on account of someone punched me We'll look into that later. Today, we're joined by one of - Hi. That's me. - Hello. How are you doing? You - you move really smoothly. - Thank you. You might be compensating - He's a what? Do I have, like, the If you looked at me, you'd go, Yeah. &quot;That's a guy named Jordan.&quot; - That's what I said when I came in. - I haven't heard since the SAT. I never took whatever the equivalent - Is it just questions? Yeah. So, like, how many numbers are there? - That is one of the questions they ask. How many numbers are there? - Um... Um, nothing. We're in a hotel after Creator Clash. We are in a hotel after Creator Clash. Um, we're in Tampa, Florida right now. We could dox ourselves. - We're at the Floridan Palace hotel. - Palace hotel. - not &quot;The Floridian.&quot; - No, that would make sense. &quot;The Floridan.&quot; - And we don't know why. We don't know who Dan is, - or who Flor is. - [CHAD CHAD] I don't know. - Yeah. &quot;Oh, it's like the Florida Palace hotel.&quot; Well, no matter how many times I see it or how many times I hear somebody say it, every time I read the name of this hotel my brain adds an &quot;I&quot; no matter what. - Where does it add the &quot;I&quot;? - Ohhh. - Idian. Dian. - Yeah? What? The - &quot;you idiot.&quot; (to the tune of &quot;American Idiot&quot;) Oh, shit, you are by birth, though. How does it feel to be back - Oh, yeah. Welcome home. I, um... I stepped outside and just And I was like, &quot;Just like old times, man.&quot; That's why I had to get it - I mean, I had to apologize when Chad Chad because I had it at 65 degrees. It was just like a wall. Yeah, it was. Because if I'm gonna - If there's one And I think I'm just more and there's just too so I have to fight it back You are the yin to my yang - Yeah. It's, I would say, the most corrosive has been the fact that I'm cold all [JARVIS] I was gonna say it's - I've had the opposite relationship uh, in romantic relationships, - because I'm always hot. And, um... Women, turns out, that I date, do not like it when it's 65deg. No, no. I was gonna say that it's like - - I kind of am on the same page as you. Whenever it's - I prefer summertime But at the same time, I don't, because then it's like inside winter. - Yeah. - It's a completely different thing. And I've always liked It does get cold in Florida, but... - Does it get less muggy when it's cold? - It's always bad. - That's good for you, I imagine. But it is nicer when it's cold. But it's always a thing and having to apologize about how cold it is. So, um, it's just like - Oh, I was gonna say, like, you don't complain as much so I appreciate that. I'm just a stoic-as-hell guy, - I'm built different. I'm kind of the verisimilitude of Uh-huh, OK, cool. If you have to say it, OK. That's fine. Just nobody was saying it, but I could tell everyone wanted to. Um, so yeah, Creator Clash is over now. We're all flying out tonight, so we just wanted to get the pod in. - [JORDAN] Go pod mode. Quick li'l - yeah, that. - We're done. It was really quick. - (garbled speaking) I can't even - Yeah. Speaking of Patreon.com/SadBoyz, there will be a bonus episode with Chad Chad right after this, but we're gonna do a whole pod You get 90 minutes of free content. - OK? Sit back down right now. Some people say, &quot;I wish they - We gotta keep Jordan in the country. No! (imitating someone Immigration. This morning, the cleaning and I had to have a which is one of my least favorite things, because I have the shame of knowing I took 5 years of Spanish and not being able to carry - Does this apply to you also? This is one of, like, - three big most American experiences. - Mm. And no one seems to If I told you, like, &quot;Yeah, I've been practicing and I just never took it and can't drive.&quot; Like, in my case, it was mostly... I mean, this applied to But I took, I think, like - It was a memorization game. - It's not immersive or, like... It's just like vocabulary words. And, um... So, it's like you cram study for a couple days before the test You memorize these words for one day, and then you, like, - toss it out to make room for other stuff. Because the American school system is very easy to game - if you're good at cramming. cram memorize, and then forget it. - That summarizes everything for me. about my own experience in school is that I didn't prioritize learning as much as I prioritized - Mm. - Same. didn't learn as much as I should've. It's like, I could say but I think that because it's so systemic it feels more like how we... how we teach and how I mean, it's asking so much of a kid when all the adults around them are - to do exactly what you did. I mean, it would be like just driving everyone saying, &quot;Nice, awesome.&quot; - Right. - Yeah. - I was doing the wrong thing. - It's the path of least resistance. Um, but for my Spanish, because I did take it for so long, it Um, but I just don't use it so regularly. But it is one of those things where, if I'm in a Spanish-speaking country, like I was in Spain for a wedding recently, and I was like, &quot;OK, I - You know? That's your Italian mobster - No, no, no, no. I'm a culture/travel guy. - That's French. uh, Brazil. - And you're not - OK. - OK, so, you're - OK, hold on. - Somebody stop him. welcoming me to France and Germany? - France in - - [CHAD CHAD] Brazil, yeah. I'm sure there's, like, a little Rio - in some German town. - A teeny-weeny little Rio? - Quick li'l Rio. - You said you also had good grades? - You got good grades in school? Nerd. - What a loser. homeschooled until - How do you get bad grades in homeschool? - if you had awful grades at homeschool. &quot;My math teacher was so mean, She was nice in math but mean in Spanish.&quot; I don't wanna assume. Um, what parent was homeschooling you? - My mom. Yeah. Um, but the thing is, and this is kinda like a... I don't know if this applies to every homeschooling experience. But there comes a point where, unless the parent who's - an actual teacher, there comes a point where they can't really help you as much as they could. - [JARVIS] Mm. apply the knowledge in a traditional grading test environment? Kinda like getting a, um... If you don't finish high school, - GED. Um, there are these programs. I'm not, like, well versed in all of them. But you'd have to report, And I think you'd also that you were gonna be and then at the end - It's not a flawless system. subjects you can squeeze in there. Like, &quot;I got an A+ in - Doing chores my mom asked me to.&quot; - Yeah. Have I talked about that? For like a year and a half, two years. You maybe have alluded to it, but I don't recall much about it. I, at like 13, I just refused to keep going - [CHAD CHAD] Mm. - I was too smart. It was too easy. It was - well, yeah, it was a mix between being really, really smart and - It would have been a mix. And being bad at class, and Uh, but I went - Yeah, I just stopped. I refused to go in for yeah, we just iced it. Said, &quot;OK, fine. Let's learn because it's also the age The grades you get at that age in do not impact anything practical. - Right. you're not applying based on - Yeah. - That is everything. It's like committing a crime And getting into not for a lot of places, but which are a lot more judicious, and then there's certain But in my case, applying for an art school, it's jazz. Like, you can just be, like... You can just write a and get some recommendations And you just get in. I got into I just didn't have any - Damn, that's like such a flex. - &quot;I don't have grades.&quot; - I have style. I have swag.&quot; - &quot;Grades? Sorry. Never heard of 'em.&quot; &quot;Um, may I attend this school with rizz?&quot; Trying to kiss them on the cheek. - Yeah. &quot;Mon ami.&quot; It always comes [JORDAN] (French accent) - [JARVIS] Still wrong. Why is the accent always French? Are you trying to figure out (French accent) No, no, - The Outback? - Still in Australia. - Look out. - like, wildlife expedition? (French accent) What the hell? A lion! - He's telling us what he sees. - There's a - a whale. - Wait, now I'm interested. (French accent) It's a whale, a land whale. (French accent) There's a land-based whale. Ah, I'm a head shark. Ah, sac - sharkrebleu. - [JARVIS] &quot;Sharkrebleu.&quot; Man. [JORDAN] I'm delirious, by the way. I think I got punched. - Oh, yeah. - [JARVIS] Big punching weekend. [JARVIS] Lots of punching. Creator Clash was super fun. have friends come out and support me. I lost. It's fine. Um, and, uh, - it was super cool. The people's champ, dude. - and then I had a classic asthma attack. Um, but that's my own doing, 'cause I got sort of caught by the lights - the My, like, nerves got the best of me, 'cause I knew I would, like, run the risk of activating my - exercise-induced asthma. Is the thing you can't train for - is stepping out into the walkout. - And Arin had done that before. Um, you know, not to take - I think he trained really hard for this. And he deserves it, and everything. He was fun about it, too. Actually, I can't think of anybody that No, I think it was all pretty... Everybody was pretty cordial And Arin and I had a mostly to talk about before and after the fight. Uh, but... Would you consider doing it, Chad Chad? - Fighting? I - somebody asked me that the other night, and I said that I don't think I would, mainly because of just - Mmhmm. - I know how much of a time, like... Yeah, yeah. It's just - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. You know, when I - I said I wouldn't do it again, and most of it is actually because 'Cause there's just so as a result of the commitment. And I'm really glad that Do you wanna keep training at all? I know obviously you Yeah, I wanna stay in shape. I definitely wanna, uh... So, one of the issues is that I had a lot of health stuff. I think I talked about this on and that prevented me from, like, running. So, I wanna try to actually focus on that and get back to running, Uh, and so I have the... What would happen and I fucked anything up - it would mean I couldn't train. So, I was in a good do my PT workouts and stuff and then also be able to train. But now, since I don't have that sort of fight coming up, I can commit some time to, like, uh, getting back to, like, cardio, because that's obviously is gonna be super beneficial just in my life moving forward. But I would consider doing, um, you know, they asked me but I didn't want to and then not being And I think that was considering that there were some people had to drop out or what have you. But... But I, uh... Because chessboxing has less of a... has less of a training window, it's something I would consider. then that's one thing. I could, like, plan ahead for something like that. Um, but for Creator Clash, you're kind of, like - I got the message about Creator Clash when I was basically on the plane - from last Creator Clash. And, uh, that's how long So, it's been a full year of - [CC] Yeah. it was a thing of, like, &quot;How is this gonna impact X, Y, So, I'm so - Like, I was smiling so much because I was like, [JARVIS] And I didn't get hurt. Unfortunately, like, I had to make a call, because I knew um, to end the fight. I waved it off. I was like, &quot;OK, I'm good.&quot; Um, and that was because I was like, &quot;I cannot catch my breath, and so as a result I will while I'm trying to catch my - Sure. - It's one of the best faces you have. That's why you're the looks - Exactly. Exactly, yeah. And we have a great - And I didn't wanna mess - I'm the face, too. - You're a face. - [JORDAN] I can't believe it. There's a... tiger? There's a rare land bird. - It flies in the sand. There is a penguin. It's a penguin. It's a safari penguin. It drives ze truck. It drives a Jeep 4Runner. It's all-wheel drive penguin. It leases a Land Rover. - (normal voice) So, anyway... - I like this character. It was a really positive experience, I had a rough night on Saturday, and, um - where, like, after sort of the &quot;lights, the camera, like, seeing fans... like, I wanna It was so great to meet everybody. Uh, it's like, because I like, live outings, it was crazy to see people and people who just really wanted photos and people, like, hyperventilating or somebody taking a photo of me in my merch before the show. And they and then I later saw them that night and we took a picture. And I You got the whole YouTube squad out. - Yeah. We got the squad out. It was cool. No, it was cool, and I got a chance to walk out - with all of you guys. And that was just, special experience for me. I was, like, almost in tears before just out of gratitude appreciation for everyone who was literally and figuratively. I think I - even thinking I... was like, in the same way you are, been so aware of you that it's just become, like, &quot;Oh, it's my boxing friend, Jarvis.&quot; Like, &quot;When are we doing the show?&quot; Uh, I... Even when we were about to walk out, it was like, &quot;Hey, you know, a bit We start walking out, I'm, you know, I'm not getting I'm feeling fine. And then I sat down, and there's something to... It's so uncinematic sitting at a low angle - 'cause - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, my coach. my little trainer fighter badge, just watching it - As soon as it started happening, I cried for like five seconds. - Yeah. - &quot;Oh, fucking hell.&quot; It took me a second to be like, - &quot;That's allowed to happen.&quot; - &quot;I don't need to get in there.&quot; I was like, &quot;I was almost in tears. - Like, I was about to cry.&quot; Not good or bad. It's just like, uh... I don't know. It was, like, overwhelming. And I know how much it means to you, Yeah. It's like, um... You know, uh, I let myself be, you know... have my emotions. Like, I let myself feel But after that, like - Or, excuse me. Yeah, And then after that, on Sunday... - It's Monday when we record this. um, and then yesterday We just got brunch together Uh, we, like, all went out last night. And just, like, being surrounded by friends and just sharing in fun times and, like, just being able to fully be present and not be thinking about how it impacts other was just such a grounding experience. I, like, tried to text that I was super grateful for them. And it meant a lot to me Yeah, I was thinking about figuring out some way that we can do similar group trips, at least for independent of - third-party kind of events. - Organized. &quot;Hey, you are going on vacation with me.&quot; Right, 'cause everyone's - it's - It's one of those situations - - Oh. (both doing French accents) It is a sand bear. - It is ze bear that buries under the sand. - I can't believe it. - My name is, uh, Xi Jinping. - (normal voice) You do it. You were saying, like, - [CHAD CHAD] Huh? You do punching next time? - In - next year at Creator Clash? - I was saying that? - Why are you talking like that? - Are you OK? I'm shy. I'm a smol bean. No, I didn't say - - I didn't say that. what if it was something &quot;it's only people that have It's the Will Haynes rule. I don't know. I... I would have to think about it. It's definitely more appealing that way than it is, like, with the whole year. And, like, you're leaving this event. If I were to leave here tonight and &quot;Next year,&quot; I would just But I don't know. I would Um... Just, like, the crowd. Like, walking - The walkout last night that was so stressful, - just walking behind you. I just had a bunch of friends. I think there was maybe 9 people total just walking behind me. Like, &quot;What are we I'm like, &quot;Nothing. Just walk out with me.&quot; - I thought it'd be cool. - That's so stressful.&quot; Me and Eddy, I feel like - That was awesome. - action shots of me and Eddy screaming. The way Eddy tells it - Eddy Burback, friend of the show. But the way Eddy tells it, he this is my Eddy. He's like, &quot;I was just gonna like I was just gonna be calm. And then I see Jordan and then I just felt like So, there's these photos of Jordan And there's a photo that's - [CHAD CHAD] Drew in the background. He's, like, concerned. He's doing the walking - That one photo of Bigfoot. Amanda took these photos - Amanda, Drew's wife, who's a friend of mine - And she was like, um... What did she tell me? No, 'cause - I was sitting next to And he was like, &quot;I just Like, I was just so confused. I was just, like, so So, I'm glad he was a good sport about me posting that It is great follow-up. Yeah. Dude, I love every Also shout out to Jakey - NakeyJakey, - Billie, Chrissy. Um, Ted, Shae. Just - Sam, Berry, Nan. Um, &quot;Sam, Berry, Nan&quot; kinda - Yeah. (quickly) Sam Berry Nan. Oh my god. The list goes on. It's like one of those things where I don't wanna leave anyone out by... But just holding onto that meant Yeah. I just... You know, I'm just - We forgot about... - Yeah. It's fine. It's OK. It's not like I'm sitting in the Oh, but you are sitting in the same room. - He chose not to say it. Oh. Where are we? - We're in the room. - No, the Floridan. Dan-it, actually. Um... Wait. So, uh, I wanna talk, Chad Chad, - about you a bit, because... - She's sweaty. I know. This is the part of the podcast - [CHAD CHAD] God. I feel like you, to a lot of people, just popped out fully formed. - You know? On the internet. - Would you say that? &quot;There's this new content creator, and they're very funny, and they're talking about men with podcasts on Yeah. Was it the podcasts? - [JARVIS] Alpha male podcasts. - You had videos before then, but... I'm just saying, um, like, what was your content creator journey like? How did you end up in the &quot;I'm gonna upload something, with my blue hair&quot;? With my - oh, god. The wig. - [JARVIS] The wig. - the blue wig. - Yeah. [CHAD CHAD] Oh my god. The Ramona Flowers. Um, so, first I'll talk about the wig. So, the wig - the wig was because - so, I buzzed my hair off in 2019 or something like that. Why? Was something weird - Um, just in my head, probably. You're like, &quot;I can't leave this place!&quot; [CHAD CHAD] You know, if you talk to - I had talked to a few It's a thing where they're like, &quot;You - [JARVIS] Yeah. just to experience it one time. but you still need to do it. I also just wanna sort of that I was kind of referencing the Britney Spears thing, because there was this thing - buzzes her hair, at least then... - It's like &quot;Oh, mental breakdown.&quot; [JARVIS] And obviously this It's just an experience, because, like, there's so much thought that goes into my hair, you know? It's just a thing that you - Yeah. Just being your friend - - thinking about your hair. you're always thinking about your hair. In the best way, 'cause it's like you've gotta be coloring - There's a lot of upkeep. And there's, &quot;I got this color. I'm gonna fix it.&quot; That's a - I talk about it, yeah. &quot;I went to the salon. And I showed them the color I want and it's not the color I want.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Oh, no!&quot; And then you send me a photo The hair looks amazing. - &quot;IT'S WRONG!&quot; &quot;I'm gonna fix it.&quot; It's kinda like - And then the next thing I find out, And I'm like, &quot;Did you even 'Cause it seems like you...&quot; I've been doing my own hair for forever, and then recently I've gotten - &quot;OK, I don't have as much time.&quot; So I've tested out a couple of I think it's just like a for so long doing it You know, I know better - Of course. - It can only miss. It's like working with editors. - Yeah. - A clear idea. You know so immediately. You immediately know, &quot;I want this. I don't want that.&quot; - [CHAD CHAD] Mmhmm. So when you see it, - Mmhmm. You're so good at finding that. You know exactly what Mmhmm. Yeah. But... But no, it wasn't like a mental. It was just something where you do it and you're not You - I don't know, you... - change your hair, you do stuff. - You express yourself with your - - And it was just something I hadn't done. So, anyway, the wigs, that was - The reason I was wearing wigs at the time was because I was growing out the buzz cut. - [JARVIS] Right. - where it's not a chic short hairstyle, and it's also not a shoulder-length hairstyle or anything like that. Um, and yeah, I don't know. So that's why I was wearing the wigs. And they weren't good wigs, hair that I had at the time. - I thought the wigs were cool. - Anyway, sorry. What was the question? got to the point where you were [CHAD CHAD] Um... I think it was like a collection of things, just over probably a period of a year. - Um... Building up to it. I think I had always been watching YouTube and consuming YouTube and just, like, almost... Like, every type, just kind of - [JARVIS] Right. - Yeah. 'Cause I was thinking about uploading - in a couple of years from then. You were like, &quot;I saw this empty - Accruing subscribers through osmosis. so that he one day will come &quot;Maybe I should make bad stuff in a couple of years.&quot; Yeah. But, um... So, yeah, it's like a where you're like, &quot;I That seems kinda cool. I wonder the pandemic happened and, um, so that was 2020, and then I started working from home, and then something happened where I was working What did you used to do? For work, if you're During the pandemic, I was for a dental and orthodontist billing company. I think I can say that, as What was the name of them? How much did you get paid? - The Floridian Palace. Um... You should - that's odd. Wait, I should - and this is - I'm sorry to do this. But I have to talk about Um... There is a sandwich shop called The Floridian, and a few of our friends accidentally Ubered there And were just stuck at a subway shop, and the driver - Nandre He was like, &quot;The driver was like, 'I'm He was like, &quot;The - &quot;This is a Jersey Mike's.&quot; OK, no, but you were working at a, uh, dental billing call center. Yeah. It was like third-party billing - for dental companies. - Oh, like so somebody - It was - we were, like, taking care of their payment accounts. Right. When I get a bill from my dentist, it's not coming from the dentist's office. It's coming from, like, - [JARVIS] &quot;Denta-bill.com&quot; or whatever. Like, say you go in and you get something - and you take a payment plan - where you're paying monthly to cover. They would be the ones - [JARVIS] Got it. Um, and I was in the and so people - it would just - It entailed people calling in and saying, &quot;My payment didn't go through,&quot; or &quot;I need - That was the job. And you didn't wanna Oh, that was great. I loved that. It was - people never took out - their anger on you. - Why would they project it to a stranger? That never happened, and - and called me names. - on account of you being a woman. They really respected my authority. When I told them what was &quot;When I told them the facts that existed.&quot; Right. That you had no personal investment in. [CHAD CHAD] Yeah, when reject your payment. Your card is expired,&quot; they always took my - &quot;Oh, no problem. I'll get that fixed.&quot; - &quot;That was on me.&quot; &quot;You were probably wrong when Um, yeah, but that was the - Are there any stories from that period in your life that - or that job that come to mind? Any shit you wanna get out? Any axe you wanna grind? - Any addresses? I'm trying to remember. There were so many. It was just like every day but it's kind of like now I've suppressed some of it. That's good. That's healthy. I think this - one time somebody was so mad about their payment not going correctly that they, like, tried to find the address of the place, like the billing place. - Um, I remember that one. - To what end? Yeah, and sometimes you would just get people who were and would say things - [JARVIS] Oh, no. Yeah, sometimes it was... It was rough. But - What a insane thing to do because you got a crown. Yeah. &quot;I got a filling - take out my anger on...&quot; - Yeah. So, I was working there, um... I started sometime in 2019. 2020, when the pandemic - - Oh, no. getting laid off and there were all It got really rough around that time, and it was just like this And it was understandable, - [JARVIS] in the customer service department talking to all these other people. So it was just like both sides... Like, all that panic and the money stuff, it got so bad in 2020 to Every day, I was just in tears, like, working from home, and just like every phone call you're just waiting for It was just terrible. - Be nice. 2-minute refractory period - between the next awful phone call. That's another thing. So, I before that call center, It is so stressful, because you're on a and you're not allowed to leave your desk except for your breaks or your lunch, and they know what you're doing - every second of the day. So, like, they know They know when you hang up the phone. They know how long you're They know how long it takes for you to - They know how long They know how long They know... you know, - they know every single second. Like, there are some You can say you're away, um, which is what you but it's like, &quot;Five minutes! You were gone for five minutes on Tuesday! And that wasn't your break time! What are you doing?&quot; - And it's just... [CC] &quot;Were you taking a massive - &quot;Show us pictures.&quot; Um, but yeah, it's just like every second, and you're just constantly, it's like eyes on you coming out of the computer And, um, they can hear. Everything's recorded, too, - Every phone call, everything you do. Right, yeah, and for - Yeah, um... &quot;For quality assurance purposes.&quot; &quot;We're just surveilling Americans Um, so yeah, call centers are not - I don't recommend. I will say that the one the billing company was worse. - [JORDAN] Really? Imagine if hell was I think I was only there for - three months or so, and, um... For reference, at the one that I was there for two years. - So the other one, the other one, I was only Um, it was - I don't know if you guys Say you go to the hospital for an outpatient - um, kind of procedure, and then maybe you get a phone call asking you about your experience. It was like that. But no, it was also just surveys in general. Like, calling, but it was cold-calling, - out, like, out-center calling, reaching out to people, not them calling in - to talk to you. No, not just medical. Right, but anything where Yeah, where you're calling someone and they, um... But also, it's like multiple choice. You - you'd have to read all the choices to them. It's like, &quot;Strongly agree, agree, disagree, or strongly disagree?&quot; And you've gotta read every... It was insane, because it was - Some of these companies would not - It's like they couldn't grasp that people do not want to do this. They don't care - about these surveys. They would send scripts. Also, there was a book of things that you were allowed to say, and you were not allowed to say anything. So, like, if I call you; written up. You can't say anything that is not in this book. What are they worried - It's - by a terrible call center.&quot; &quot;This one's worse than the one &quot;This one's worse,&quot; yeah. It was - it was so insane. Somebody would be like, &quot;Oh, - flipping through this book. - That's how bad it was. a rare thing that you would get. It was, yes. It was. - &quot;Who the fuck is this?&quot; - &quot;Why are you calling me?&quot; - I really don't blame them. - I need to... where in the...?&quot; They told me to jump off a bridge.&quot; [JARVIS] Yeah. Um, &quot;It says I say, 'Oh, thank you. Have a nice day' in response &quot;Jump off a bridge&quot; is the - Like, the most common saying. They're like, &quot;Oh, 'F off &quot;'Lie down in the middle &quot;No, a rare insult is on page 17. It says, uh, 'I hope you get &quot;A lot of options for this.&quot; &quot;Huh? What? Why?&quot; &quot;I hope you get run over by a penguin - in a 4Runner&quot;? [JORDAN] &quot;They have that?&quot; &quot;What accent are you doing, sir?&quot; Oh, yeah, I guess you have to be, like, faux formal as well, right? Like, &quot;Oh, well thank you, - Um... - [CHAD CHAD] &quot;Sire.&quot; &quot;Many thanks upon you, &quot;Ever so grateful.&quot; &quot;Fuck off and die in the road.&quot; &quot;I wanna kill you with an axe.&quot; Page. &quot;I can't read, sir.&quot; &quot;What does this book say?&quot; &quot;Unfortunately, I don't know how to read.&quot; &quot;I must follow the parchment.&quot; &quot;I must follow the scroll.&quot; &quot;Let me consult the scroll.&quot; [JARVIS] It's like Dobby the house-elf. &quot;I'm afraid I can't speak back to you, sir. I'm not allowed to respond to that one.&quot; You get fired by being given a sock. Oh, remember when Hermione and JK Rowling had her - &quot;Stop being so annoying.&quot; &quot;Hermione, you should shut up, - &quot;What a try-hard.&quot; Yeah. &quot;You nerd. You anti-slavery dork.&quot; &quot;You stupid nerd, dude.&quot; - Oh my god. - Oh my god. I'm, like - is there something that we can for the well-being of people who are in that job today? Like, how has that affected Like, when you find yourself talking to someone from a call center. You're definitely a lot nicer. I mean... - Oh, like you are when you receive those. &quot;What's uuuuup - you can't answer that.&quot; Well, actually, my mom - So, when I was working at They called it the Survey Corps as When I was working, I, uh - I was working there and my mom, um, she obviously knew what the job was, 'cause I was still living And, um, one day she was like, &quot;Oh, I got a call today, um, asking me to do a survey, and I did it because I She was like, &quot;I told them to - F off and... don't die.&quot; &quot;Jump off a bridge&quot;? &quot;Jump off a bridge, but - &quot;Land safely.&quot; - &quot;Is your refrigerator running?&quot; - Oh my god. (Britishly) &quot;I'm afraid I'm not allowed - to respond to that one.&quot; &quot;No one's ever said nuffin' so nice to me.&quot; &quot;Why is this in the paper?&quot; &quot;Oh, goodness 'pon gracious.&quot; - This guy... &quot;I'm off to Australia.&quot; &quot;Going to the outback to - Non-spon. I guess just... To what you were saying about the current call center employees, - it's not their fault. Like, ever. - They also don't like it. don't want to be doing, probably, what they're having to do. And it's like, the... Um, I guess compartmentalizing the - The person you're talking to and the company that you - are not, like, the same. They're not - they're not one and one. They don't have the same in a lot of cases, they're when you call in, and they... They probably have as but, like, they're gonna So, as long as you understand and you don't just jump on there like, because you know, because so obviously you know everything um, that's the wrong mentality to have when you hop on the phone. Do you feel like any of that kind of, uh, resilience and endurance was helpful for the creator Getting into YouTube was a little easier because you're used to - being very tired? I've never thought... Like, you mean getting comments? No, just purely like the to get that career going, knowing the feeling of being burned out and, I guess, having a job where you don't have to talk to anyone if you don't want to. Yeah. I think... that was definitely... a good thing, where it &quot;I'm gonna make these videos, and nobody's gonna - [CHAD CHAD] That's always a plus. text-to-speech YouTube support calls. (stilted) &quot;We'd like to read you - on your new video.&quot; I have been tilling the field.&quot; - [CHAD CHAD] There is this - &quot;The Mongols have destroyed my farm.&quot; - &quot;The Dothraki horde.&quot; Um, there is this thing that I remember vividly at the beginning of YouTube that I don't know if Um, where you don't have a following, and so when you post videos the only people who see it are people who don't give a shit - about you. - And so every comment is mean. It is like a cold-call, yeah! - So nobody cares. And they're like, &quot;How dare you? Why are you doing that?&quot; - &quot;Go sit down.&quot; I don't know why Shorts but I'd say one in every five YouTube is a four-view &quot;vlog of my day at - It's, like, oddly small-scale. Uh, and I... I have checked the because it's being shown - it almost This is a post for friends. - It's accidental, yeah. Then they post, you know, like, &quot;Here's me playing Batman: - Yeah. - Stupid gaming bitch.&quot; It's just like, &quot;Why - This is crazy.&quot; I remember Hannah Hart, who's like a sort of previous um, like when she started, I mean. Her channel, I was watching a talk with her years ago and she talked about how she wanted to share herself cooking with a friend of hers - that was not physically, like, located - and that that was the best way to do that, was to make a video on YouTube. And then it just so happened to be public. - Wow. My Drunk Kitchen video. - That's insane. - That's amazing. she's like, &quot;What the hell? People are - oh my god, a bunch - It was just supposed to be for Lauren.&quot; It starts out &quot;Hi, Lauren,&quot; you know? - &quot;Hello, Lauren, and no one else.&quot; - &quot;Oh, she's rewatching this a lot.&quot; - &quot;140,000 times.&quot; - and just keeps commenting.&quot; Yeah. &quot;Why would she say that about me?&quot; So, we should talk about the fact that you create under a pseudonym. - Do we? Robert... what's the JK Rowling one? &quot;Robert Kendrell&quot; or whatever. - Oh, yeah. Robert E. Lee. That might be it. Um, Kingsley Shacklebolt. - Robert Galbraith. - She doesn't really... She isn't really subscribing Her name is flexible. That's interesting. Yeah. OK. So, but you create under a pseudonym, and the reason I bring that up is because you were talking about And the reason that I don't have that experience is because the first videos I posted, I shared with my Facebook friends. - Ohhh. were people I knew in real life. Nobody know that I was So yeah, that does make sense. Yeah. So, that makes You were literally an anonymous person. You're like when someone - That's, like, you. - Yeah. I just floated onto the beach. - &quot;I can't remember anything.&quot; &quot;Oh, have you seen these &quot;What the hell? Why - I'm able to make fun of these guys.&quot; &quot;Her voice kinda sounds like somebody who asked me if I strongly I just, like, every - I give a take and then I'm like, &quot;Strongly agree, agree, - disagree, strongly disagree?&quot; and I don't know why.&quot; &quot;We're not on the phone, &quot;I'm on a date. Shut the hell up!&quot; - Um... Did you even, at any point, question-mark whether you should - use your real name? - [JORDAN] Just, day one? It's just, like, a thing of just people getting my name wrong, never remembering my name. And that was in real life, like, when you're face-to-face with people. And so I was like, on the internet, my channel name if I use my real name. That's so interesting, because... I feel like an idiot - Do you? Jarvis Johnson is a stage name, and I'm like, &quot;No, that's - Was that an option?&quot; - a guardian's maiden name, or...? What would you have done? - Mm... - [CHAD CHAD] Blade. - Uh, Sicko Killingsworth. - From Hogwarts. &quot;The Murder Teacher.&quot; - Yeah, I teach knifery. was in one of those books, we'd be called Indentured O'Servitudey. Um, what did I say my name would be? Um... My name would be, like, Halfsie - Wait, I think I tweeted this. Caramello Contrastie. &quot;Caramello Contrast.&quot; Oh my god. I definitely, um - I can't believe she called Every single time I think it's actually impressive that her and Robert got away with it. Yeah, I tweeted, &quot;Downloading Hogwarts Legacy just so It's be great if there was, like, a - I know there was a conscious effort to, you know, distance itself psychopath behavior of whatever her name is. Slash the Jynx. Uh, and they - I know one of the things was like, uh, they included a trans character It would be fun if, whenever you do you make like a Black character and the game goes, like, Um... uh, there's something - - Oh, there's a bug. We can't.&quot; That name's been taken.&quot; It's like, &quot;This is an offline game.&quot; - &quot;Yeah, but it's...&quot; We saved some just in case.&quot; &quot;Oh, it's... it's uninstalling.&quot; &quot;It was a character we cut, so you're not allowed to use the name.&quot; &quot;No, no, no. That word is not yours.&quot; &quot;That word is not yours.&quot; - 23andMe. - Oh, shit. It's looking at me and - Yeah. &quot;Hmm, interesting.&quot; - Yeah, you could use half the word. - Oh my god. What were you saying about race? (inaudible) - Yeah, what isn't she saying? - Um, do you - Do you ever, um, feel like a plastic bag? Um, do - do people - - Drifting through the safari. Um... oh, man. When you said the guy at I was like, he's like, I know - I absolutely consciously thought, &quot;I cannot say 'the zoo.'&quot; I need to stop talking about... desert-based animals. And also a whale. So, does anybody I guess friends, but are there who know what you do now? Not many. I mean, it's just close friends. I think that some people recently found out at my old job, but that was very recent. It was like right before I came here. - Oh, really? Um, they - we had a - or I had a group text with a few of my old coworkers. I haven't talked to them in a long time. just out of the blue &quot;Oh, just saw your stuff. - Great job.&quot; And I was like... I was like, &quot;I have questions. Yeah. I wanna know where... how that happened, because it's been... - (a la &quot;One Week&quot;) It's been. Since you looked at me. Sorry. Sometimes, whenever we just sing the song &quot;One Week&quot; by Barenaked Ladies. The, it's been one week since - You found out what I do. I no longer work at a call center. It's been one week Do you agree, strong agree, Wanna look at some silly shit? Yeah. Yeah, I do. I'd like to get a little We were talking about etiquette content. - [CHAD CHAD] Oh, yeah. So, for those who don't know, uh, etiquette is, like, how you be high-class. - Polite. And high-class. - In kind of a traditional sense. - [JARVIS] Very traditional sense. putting your forks in the right place. - Like, remember Black.White? - Remember the etiquette class? - Yeah. that's the opposite of - Being nice.&quot; &quot;The white people? They're - That's right. &quot;The white people are Right, yeah. They send - - the two families swap races. - And - Standard fare. And they're like, &quot;What do Black people do? They do poetry and they talk about the Black struggle,&quot; so they have them go to, like, museums and they have them go to And they're like, Uh, they send the Which feels racist. - And is. He's just disinterested. - Yeah. He's not anything you - He's not impolite. - call him the N-word. They're so bad. - Oh my god. But, I mean, I guess because of that, yeah, we're kinda emphasizing - etiquette is arbitrary, right? It's not like being empathetic It is just &quot;don't have the wrong vibes. Do the right thing. Be trad.&quot; - Yeah. So, we've - Trad Trad. - Hang on. We just share the same brains. - One of us is gonna have to change. Chad Chad has a great video that you can go and watch Um, if you haven't heard or seen You are one of my favorite - Aw, thank you. Shucks. You really are. - Thanks.

No, that's our lives, right? We go a little back I'm random as fuck, basically. - [CHAD CHAD] So random. It's nice to have, uh - We've known each other a little while, but we've not spent much time in person, and I feel like we are friends now, - Friendy-wendies. - Now declare us friends. The Florida Boxing Commission has declared - that you are now friends, legally. - He is in Tampa. OK, let's start with &quot;elegant ladies which, can we just talk about Can we take a guess? - If you've seen this one? but I know exactly what the format is. - Mmhmm. OK. So, you - OK, so we'll just and then you can - You can tell us how we match up. - I'll rate, yeah. OK, so the funny joke is that &quot;never eat sandwiches like this,&quot; and that's like, &quot;No lady can eat that.&quot; But I think she's gonna talk about, um, specifically how you go into the sandwich. I, maybe - hmm. Do you not get the You maybe chop it up into more...? - Yeah, use a fork and knife? Or she deconstructs it like a psychopath. - Oh, dear. Also, why does that pretzel feel like an - uncanny-valley size? because it's not a regular pretzel, but it's not a jumbo pretzel. - What's the deal? - What's the point? It looks like an individually-wrapped regular pretzel. And there's so much sandwich. It's like the, uh - that's like Mama Bear. It's like the middle one. Yeah, it's a very strange pretzel. All right. Why'd she OK. So the first version, &quot;Shove the whole thing in.&quot; Which, if you'll notice, she's - It's just a normal bite. - She's a prude. - in the way she describes the bad way. &quot;Don't shove the whole thing in like this.&quot; Takes a normal... A regular human bite - Look at that. Come on. No, no, no. &quot;Play with their food&quot;? - Yeah. You can't take the bacon if you're a vegetarian. - Yeah, do not. Don't mess with the structure - That includes making the sandwich itself. You're allowed to eat each &quot;Uh-uh!&quot; I like her little finger-waggle. - What? I have seen this one. You're... &quot;Pile food inside&quot;? So she's putting - So, it's like if you have - and coleslaw on the side, - Oh, that sounds delicious. But you're not supposed to, like, put the coleslaw on top as you're supposed to. - Is that... common behavior? I tend to just bite... fork. - I feel like people do that. But what about sandwiches where you're expressly Yeah, like a sauce? - Yeah. You have to get out as quickly as - What about, like, we - I'm putting syrup on my waffles. - I'm supposed to stop? Stop putting food on top of your food. - Nope. - No plate. - sandwiches should not be allowed. Sandwiches, by definition, Eating bread. Oh, here's what you do. Hold on. No, she's gonna &quot;Cut a small&quot; - dude, the fact &quot;graciously&quot; in here makes my skin crawl. I'm reading this comment. Um, &quot;Cut a small piece off - and graciously bite.&quot; She cut because she did not graciously cut. Look how bad that cut is. - That is a very non-gracious cut. - She needs a steak knife. with a butter knife, and it's clearly a - strong piece of bread. - a loaf of sourdough. It's huge. Oh, she didn't even eat the - Right. That would be unladylike. - You have to eat very slowly. It's like the way to be ladylike - to eat your sub from Jersey Mike's. Don't open it and look at the Leave the coleslaw on the Yeah, I feel like this... Like, I don't understand why the Sandwich Shack or whatever, The putting coleslaw, that... I can't believe - she could &quot;Don't eat the coleslaw by itself. Do put it on there,&quot; and I would have read - I'd have been like, &quot;Oh, it's a process.&quot; What if the video ended with her - Yeah. - &quot;Remember that.&quot; One of the things that I encountered is you're not allowed to say &quot;toilet&quot; - in these, in this kinda thing. - [JARVIS] Or &quot;restroom&quot;? If you need to go to the - This is, like, in the intro of my video. But if you need to use the bathroom, the only acceptable way to announce that is to say, &quot;Excuse me one moment.&quot; And you're not allowed to say &quot;restroom.&quot; You're not allowed to, like, say You're not allowed to... They're like, &quot;You don't need - That's what an assassin does before - Opens the top of the toilet. OK, literally, yes, - But one lady was like - &quot;Because you're not a child,&quot; &quot;You don't need to announce it, &quot;Not everybody poops, actually.&quot; - You have to be mysterious. - [JORDAN] &quot;You little loser.&quot; - &quot;Oh my god, you poop?&quot; - &quot;You little freak.&quot; - &quot;It's disgusting.&quot; give information about &quot;Excuse me.&quot; I would be so worried. - &quot;Excuse me. Excuse me one moment.&quot; &quot;Where did Jordan go?&quot; - Driving through the fucking - - Bouncing around. he's taking off gloves. &quot;Where did you go?&quot; Yeah, I come back and my - Like, &quot;Ow, ow, ow!&quot; - &quot;Ow! It stings!&quot; I'm holding a suitcase. &quot;Why do you have four passports?&quot; - &quot;Could you pass me one of my passports?&quot; &quot;This one's for Australia.&quot; Are these typically by Is there a lot of I only saw, like, four main ones, I think, and then everybody else was, like, in between all the other ones. Well, not everybody can be elegant. Not everyone. It's not for everybody. - Have you improved yourself? - You get hungry. - Um, yeah. At the end of my video, I, uh, I did. - We'll have to watch the video. - Do one where you... &quot;I'M GOING TO THE TOILET!&quot; One piece at a time, You spit coleslaw onto the sandwich. - Into the toilet. Royalty-free metal (imitating metal riff) Instead of, like, Kevin MacLeod No. 1. - &quot;Don't announce you're going&quot; - OH! - &quot;Simply excuse yourself.&quot; The laugh? - Oh, that was the whole thing. - That was the whole thing. So... - Give us more. - &quot;Basic lady etiquette tips.&quot; She's actually pretty cool. I actually really like her a lot. - I don't - - Like, very often? To anyone? &quot;City scooter etiquette.&quot; Or, When you're in Italy on your... - Her name is Sofia Marbella. to an audio-based listener? Um, there is... There's a man in what sitting on a motorcycle, - and she's mounting - in the process of mounting - In a very cavalier way. I think she's meant to be doing the wrong version of - She's getting onto it like a cowpoke. Yeah. She has to use an umbrella - and then float down to it. &quot;The true proper etiquette is to Up+B.&quot; Yeah. - &quot;Pass ledge and onto bike.&quot; onto the city scooter. Sorry; that's a Super Oh, I've never heard of that. - Eh, joke, joke, joke, joke. - Um... - What?! Oh, that's odd. - That's just shamey. OK. I didn't see this one. - This is so... - Helpful. Yeah, this is so pointed. This reminds me of, um, that account that's like - &quot;people of Walmart&quot; or something? This just, like, - taken discreetly behind somebody. Cut to a photo of - two innocent bystanders just riding a motorbike, and I don't know; it is because her lower back is visible? - Yeah. Or, better yet, these are just - maybe they - Yeah. And then she goes, &quot;Uh-uh-uh. &quot;No, no, no.&quot; - &quot;Don't live your life your way.&quot; - &quot;I would never do such a thing.&quot; - ...Seen this. - So, we got a boy this time. Oh, this is for the boys! - This is for the boys. Finally a little bit of representation, eh? - Yeah, finally. - a little time on the mic. who get to be elegant. We have &quot;Good manners #goodmanners #dating #manners...&quot; - Yup. You got it, dude. [TIKTOKKER] When walking never sit across from her from the table. Don't let each of you just - [CHAD CHAD] Oh my god. lead her to where she's gonna sit, - Mm... - Yeah. &quot;Casually sit...&quot; - &quot;Look at me.&quot; - &quot;I'm crazy.&quot; I feel like it's respectful to I don't think - I would ra - it's easier. It's easier to have a conversation. - Yeah, your neck. &quot;Hey, can you sit next to me,&quot; you know? &quot;I would rather sit - Like if it's communicated. But I think that this is like, &quot;That way it's easier - You don't have to reach across. 'Cause now you can do one of these. and you can do X, Y, and Z, - what else you ever do on dates. one of the essential stages - That's a real thing and a real term. And I can't remember - heard this on a podcast. Cut a hole in a box. Step two: And good manners: Let her open the box. [TIKTOKKER] Always be a - before pouring your own. - I think it said &quot;serve.&quot; &quot;Save her first.&quot; - What's in that water? - before assisting others. - &quot;Save her first.&quot; &quot;Get it away.&quot; When you excuse yourself &quot;Save her first.&quot; [TIKTOKKER] ...Napkin on the table, make - No. - Yeah, that's insane. This is so much, like, setting her up. It's like, &quot;Place her like - Place a cloth across her.&quot; &quot;Pick up the food by hand - &quot;Cut her sandwich into tiny pieces.&quot; with a bottle. Where it disappears. This is etiquette to learn - Mmhmm. Do this for her before Always put food on her plate [JARVIS] She's not a child. OK. I'm sorry. Putting food - why - Why is the food coming...? truffle fries and put them onto your date's plate. - She's reaching, and you grab her wrist. - &quot;The rules.&quot; - Those hands of yours aren't good here.&quot; - &quot;Throw her hands away.&quot; - &quot;Hey, quit it.&quot; - No, this is so infantilizing. Especially the napkin. Just, like, reaching over, Not close, but like dressing someone, like putting a jacket on a kid - helping someone tie their shoes. It's like what my mom would - [CHAD CHAD] Yeah. the, the... for a little consensus here? You go to a casual bar like this, date or just hanging with people. You get food. Full restaurant. You putting - No. - Yeah. Well, yeah. If you're using it - easier to have up here. I don't think that you usually get, like, a cloth napkin at a restaurant like this. - At, like, an outside? Dude, it's like a bench Yeah. This is like a Dave &amp; Buster's. Yeah. This is a Buca di Beppo. Can we go back and watch her 'Cause I know she's I do like the part where, you know, he looks into the camera right before he puts the cloth on her. [TIKTOKKER] Sit next to her. Sorry. Why... Why is the mix on the ding - on all of these so messed up? - is so, like, abrupt. (all imitating the ding and buzzer) It legitimately, like, hurts. - Yeah. The first one made me flinch. [TIKTOKKER] And pour her If there's a napkin on the - He's like, &quot;This is a napkin.&quot; He goes, &quot;This...&quot; &quot;I'm gonna tuck you in now.&quot; - Yeah. &quot;Nighty-night!&quot; [TIKTOKKER] And put it on her lap for her. - You see her face?! - &quot;The fuck are you doing, man?&quot; She looks confused and annoyed, - and she's in on it. 'Cause she didn't say anything. But are you supposed to, - She doesn't if she's an object. - We shouldn't do that? - She's still learning to talk. Always put food on her What food are they eating? That is... - What is that? [JARVIS] They look like big chips. - [JARVIS] You don't have to put that... It looks like you wouldn't use a knife and He's having to use them like - I truly can't tell what that is. They picked - here's the thing. Here's what's obvious: - to demonstrate this with. &quot;Serve her first. One big chip.&quot; - &quot;Madam.&quot; He's got the loaded nachos. He's trying to, like, and all the shredded cheese that's melted. &quot;Please don't put any of - That is against the rules.&quot; - Don't pile food on food. [TIKTOKKER] When your This is my favorite part. So, he serves her. And then he goes... &quot;And for me, a single chip.&quot; - &quot;That's all I'll have.&quot; - Wait, wait, wait. Did - I think it... Did he say &quot;When she&quot; - ? He said that when she - tell the waiter. what she wants, take the Oh. The phrasing, the So... I think he just means... It does sound very weird, but I think he means if you're conversing, you're talking about it, and she's like, and then the waiter is closer to you just go ahead and do it. But the... I don't wanna give him I like the idea that you're like, &quot;I'll She was gonna say, like, bourbon. She's like, &quot;Oh, bourbon.&quot; - &quot;The bourbon as well.&quot; &quot;I'll take the burg-en.&quot; &quot;And then for the meal, I think I'll have the lasaaaagna.&quot; &quot;She'll have the lasagna, uh, flipped. She'll have it upside-down, no sauce?&quot; It's like Elon Musk trying to get credit for doing things that already exist. - Oh, yeah. lasagna, but it's, uh, - &quot;How about a tweet, but it's longer?&quot; &quot;But it's annoying. You have I want that. Wait, you were saying [CHAD CHAD] Oh, I did say that. - I was just talking about that. - In detail. - Yeah. - It was like 30 minutes. - It was upsetting. You kept pointing at the Doge, &quot;From the meme, guys. The coin!&quot; Um, just kidding. It was a joke. I wonder what the ratio is between... 'Cause I almost feel like, generally, and you'll be the authority on this, &quot;etiquette,&quot; I think is quite gender-coded. - Mmhmm. uh, yeah, like Catholic - girls' school etiquette. Whereas... I don't know, chivalry or something is like - [CHAD CHAD] Yeah. putting a... I wouldn't think of doing things for other people's 'cause isn't it what you do? - Like which forks you use or whatever? So, like, which forks It's like if he... was the one, uh, taking the knife and the fork cutting a small piece of placing it graciously in her mouth. Graciously stuffing it Yeah, I wanna see that. - &quot;How to call a waiter elegantly.&quot; - OK, you're not allowed to do... - That's just mean. OK, so the first example was her - &quot;come hither.&quot; How is that ever gonna be effective? Yeah, I haven't done that in so long. It hurts. - It hurts, yeah. Whoa, I just made Yeah. &quot;Hey, right now.&quot; Does anyone wanna guess I want, um, this one. - This one, and then this one. - Ohhh. - &quot;Come on!&quot; Oh, what about, uh - wait, no, not that. - No. Yeah, just raising a fist. - You're just like... What about this? &quot;Me hungry.&quot; Like, rubbing your tummy. (fake-crying) - Like a sim? - Oh, there it is. - Don't do that. So, you have to raise your With two fingers? Is that...? You gotta shoot the sky. Like a race. Like a race is starting. Isn't putting up two what gets Michael Fassbender - Yes. &quot;Yeah, two.&quot; - She's gonna get shot in the balls. It feels like, uh... It feels like it's a code for something. She puts this up and then she nods. - And you know. You know. It's like, yeah, that'll work, because it's basically the same as which is raising your hand. Well, the last one, that is essentially - the last one she did. It was just she was just Yeah, exactly. And she shook it around. Yeah. Not that one. No, not that one. - There. - That's... &quot;You're not owning it enough.&quot; You must salute. &quot;Garcon.&quot; &quot;I'll take the egg.&quot; - &quot;A single egg and loaded nachos.&quot; - Have you guys seen - Have you guys seen the TikTok trend where you, um, show how you ask for the check? - [CHAD CHAD] At the restaurant? With... no. I don't know how to explain they're not actually asking - very dramatic version, and show how they would It's like who does it best. - Is it comedy, or...? - [CHAD CHAD] Yeah, it's comedy. 'Cause there could be a but they're all so damn sincere. Did you find any, like, Like, &quot;Eat your fork&quot;? - That'd be funny, right? It's fucking funny. This one seems to be - This is from Sofia, our Italian queen. This is cinema etiquette. - Cinema etiquette. &quot;Part 1&quot;?! - Um... &quot;Avoid going through your...&quot; - &quot;And don't...&quot; - Oh. OK? Wait, what does it say? - (Jarvis sighs) So, there's a woman - there is a woman shuffling, past other theater movie watchers. But shuffling facing the screen, like, just being, I don't know, grabbable? What's their point? - I don't understand. - Then they have to look at your back. The correct way is to make eye contact &quot;I'm so sorry. I'm so incredibly sorry.&quot; Hold their hand while you do it. - &quot;Can you help me?&quot; you need to be that prim and proper. - It's, like, a grungy movie theater. Like I told you, It's just like a - There's even one where it's like, - Or &quot;Don't eat food while you watch TV.&quot; Because it's like a lifestyle, like a constant thing. - It's not something that turns off. That's the difference. Etiquette classes are for dining - or, like, for special events, but then these are just like, &quot;You need to be doing this for the rest of your life, - This is just what you do everywhere.&quot; - What a exhausting way to live. Yeah, when you were telling me about not being able to wear sweatpants and eat food at home - Yeah, it was just like, &quot;Ladies, don't wear sweatpants when Oh, it's also, &quot;Ladies, don't slouch when you're at home,&quot; like, on the couch. So you need to keep your back straight and, like, maintain your posture. - Cock facing the world. Hard face. - Yeah, do a green line test. OK, well, um... &quot;This used to be me.&quot; - You've seen this one. - Hang on. &quot;This used to be me.&quot; - &quot;I hopped out of rooms...&quot; That was, like, - also the fakest-looking accident ever. That's a very HD CCTV camera. It was just like a - she just... Like, this is like bad jumping form. Why was she hopping out of the place? Yeah, why were you hopping out of the - Bringing the drink. &quot;I was at my worst,&quot; going back - &quot;I was at my worst.&quot; - &quot;I was airborne.&quot; When you get so sloshed that Yeah, who took the photo - of her in front of the toilet? Black and white filter on it. Or is this security footage Why did that look like a cut from - That looked like something It does look like a reality show. - That looks - this must be one. - Dude, look at this. Oh. - Oh! OH! - You recognize her? Who has the channel. She has a channel that is - The entire thing is about how to, like, - get a high-class man. How to be a lady so you can catch a man. Um, &quot;Where To Meet High-Value Men.&quot; - &quot;Signs He's A Low-Value Man. (Get Out!)&quot; Yeah. &quot;10 Things That - Get out. - &quot;What To Gift A High-Value Man?&quot; That's a question I just... - That's a problem I have all the time. re-coding of a very, you know, kind of pretty classic &quot;12 Rules for Life,&quot; - alpha, sigma channel. But, like... - Wait, I recognize her as well. You might recognize this because three years ago I sent this to you &quot;Should we talk about this?&quot; - Oh, yeah! - Um... - &quot;Look Effortlessly Expensive.&quot; - of course, in a heartbeat. Have you ever felt obliged, not necessarily for the exact 'cause these are deranged, but have you ever felt - ladylike or elegant? I do make a couple comments where it's, um... I don't know if you've heard but, um, even when you're a kid, how you sit is a big thing Jordan could take a few... - take a few notes. - and people like to put timestamps. No, um, I just mean in a ladylike fashion. So, it's like you need to... Like, if you sit with your legs Oh, I see. You have to be - kinda demure and chaste. And it's just a really accepted criticism, I think, of young girls. And, um, that's one of I've had experience with, where it's like, - &quot;Stop. You're doing that bad,&quot; you know? And you're just, like, with one leg kind of up here on a chair, - that's not ladylike. What a physically - Yeah. The only acceptable way is just legs out in front of you, closed. And it's like any... any variation from that is... is bad. It does seem like a point system, almost. Where it's like, &quot;You can do it; you'll just be 15% less. Sorry. You just won't be - Yeah. You're just not being You've missed. You're actually bad. Low-grade. Do you feel cleansed of that Yeah. I... Yes, definitely. I mean, there's other examples, just like talking loudly is - and I think that... I have a personal theory that that causes a lot of just like when, growing up a girl, you... it's harder to make jokes, - I feel like, and be the funny one. - I think it's harder, because you have to, like, draw more attention to yourself, and that's something that, was looked down on or not encouraged, where it's like, &quot;Shhh.&quot; Just like the side, like, or &quot;Shh, that's not&quot; - or &quot;You're behaving in a way that's drawing you know. Or just saying something, and you get to the point where and then that's when a dude says the same thing and the whole room breaks out - You're a ghostwriter. I think that the two kinda go hand in hand. Um... How did you, like, overcome some of those pressures? Especially if you had people in your life I - (sighs) I don't know. I think I became more just reserved in those kind of circles. Mm. So you adjusted, like, locally, in that situation, &quot;I'm gonna keep being Eventually. I mean, obviously deciding on that. But I think it's better now, definitely, and YouTube has helped. When you say something and - &quot;Cool.&quot; &quot;That's not a stupid thing. Sometimes Right. I definitely know what you mean. 'Cause I... It's weird to, like, have Like, you try. You want to make people laugh. - &quot;Oh, so I'm not... OK, cool.&quot; - &quot;That's weird.&quot; It's interesting only getting - a lot of the time. I don't necessarily think X video is bad, or if Y joke didn't land, but sometimes is... Well, no, I don't think I'm that funny. I wouldn't laugh out loud - watching my videos. - But also - though, sometimes, so... - No, but - The text thing is - sorry to interrupt you. - No, please. because it takes a lot for But in real life, like, there are so many people who will enjoy your stuff silently, and it brings so much value to their life, and it makes them laugh and blah-blah. But they don't feel like because they don't know you, and it's weird to leave a comment. That's like the most normal... Like, the people who leave comments, we appreciate you when they're positive. But it's the less-trodden path. It's the path less taken. Rather than, like, casually consuming, which is Were you, at any point, or amongst certain groups, the funny one? Or the charismatic one, I don't think so. I don't think so, ever. No. - I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Yeah. No one likes me. - and my breath, and... Well, that's true, Yeah. Were you cracking people up? I don't really remember. I think I had too many Like, I was homeschooled. Mmhmm. There was no audience. Yeah. I'm just, like, talking to my mom. - My mom told me I was funny, so... - That's cute. - [CHAD CHAD] Oh. I was the class clown, yeah. No, I feel like that type I've never had any of - from any sort of parental anything. [JORDAN] Is she funny? Yes. My mom is very, um... I feel like she could've It just comes very naturally to her. One time I had her help me with a sketch, and I needed her to play and acting like she didn't know me. And she just, like, first take, was immediately, I didn't need to do anything else. Just immediately was yelling. - and I was scared. Yeah. &quot;I still live here. &quot;No, I'm not really the person. We're doing acting.&quot; Um, well, I think this is a great place to end this episode of Sad Boyz.
