We've already stolen so many words so many that they make up a But nevertheless, I think... we've got room for some more. Here are my top ten untranslatable French Welcome to another RobWords. Okay, before we start, Those are both French words, by the way. Number one, by untranslatable I mean words word equivalent in English. When I say steal, to stop using these words I've taken all of these from the French it is the French that I know best. And four, if you disagree with me about Okay, c'est parti. Let's go. At number ten - we're working backwards for allow me to greet you into this It is &quot;rebonjour&quot;. See if you can guess what this one Because to do that, from a friend. A french friend. [Julie] Et bonjour! [Julie] Mais oui! Ca fait plaisir This is Julie. She's a french teacher from the south a proper French perspective So firstly, let's just ask I use rebonjour a lot because sometimes I see them 2 hours later and I So rebonjour. So it's essentially &quot;hello again&quot;, syllables versus four. It's more like saying &quot;rehello&quot;. And if you happen to encounter someone say 5pm or 6pm you can throw them &quot;Regoodevening&quot;. And if you are really pressed for time I'm told that in either case you can Easy. We don't have rehello. So lets have rebonjour. Straight on to another At number nine, it is &quot;gourmandisle&quot;. So this word is related to words you will delivered with a French flourish. Words like gourmet and gourmand. But &quot;la gourmandise&quot; has not found and we're all the poorer for it. La gourmandise is It is the activity of eating for eating It's a word that could only Now, don't you be saying, hold on, Because, no. Even if it is admittedly included in But that was written ages ago and by now on a somewhat sweeter flavour. La gourmandise, it's not negative at all. It's a quality. The implication there is that it's It's a little bit naughty, yeah, but it's For food. Talking about food. We might A rather lazy invention, as words go, It's a decent translation that's masculine and feminine - I've always thought it telling that English version of &quot;bon appetit&quot;. It's almost as if we don't expect anyone deep fried potatoes and slime. Although, god, I love that stuff. And it's perhaps equally telling that we guilt-free enjoyment of food. So let's stop grub shaming one another Gourmandise. Delicious. Up next at number eight, and staying As a verb, gouter just means to taste, but as a noun it becomes a daily delight. There are little sort of mealtimes and it sort of fits in with But there's gouter, right? What happens at gouter? So I have four meals a day because is &quot;l'heure de gouter&quot;. You can have une madeleine, It's the sweet moment of the day. Yes, &quot;le gouter&quot; is a little sweet I think it's mostly designed to keep after they've come home from school. But plenty of French adults It's not a million miles off what we tea or fourses, but no cups of Earl Grey Just something to satisfy your sweet If French kids get to have it, Okay, next, &quot;numero sept&quot;: You've seen it in the names It's &quot;chez&quot;. You quite likely already know that putting for example, is the same as But when you take it out of this formulaic and put it in the context of a full French a much more involved grammatical role. Unlike &quot;...'s place&quot;, chez is Prepositions are words like &quot;in&quot; or &quot;on&quot; Words which tell you about one Only chez is a preposition In English I can say but also However, in French I would have to say where &quot;a&quot; equates to &quot;to&quot; but &quot;je viens *chez* vous&quot;. Not &quot;a chez vous&quot;, not &quot;to chez vous&quot; but just &quot;I am coming chez vous&quot;. So what's the difference between the Well chez is the preposition that you use a direct reference to a person for example: &quot;je vais chez le coiffeur&quot;. To replicate what the word chez actually to say &quot;to the place of&quot;. So what we require four words for, Four letters four words. I'm convinced. &quot;Chez&quot;, viens chez nous! Now if all these fabulous French words I highly recommend you Learning French and German And although it isn't easy, you that it is, there are plenty of tools find them with this video's sponsor: Lingoda is an ideal way to quickly and talented language who's one of the teachers on there. Within just a few clicks you can have at a time that suits your schedule. I actually had one yesterday [Rob] Merci... C'est exactement ca. Funnily enough, the theme of the lesson From my experience, the best way to learn and Lingoda gets you doing in a really supportive environment. Plus its three learning paths let you fit learning a language around So use my discount code PS15 or whatever your off lessons with Lingoda and boost I'll stick a link in the description. Lets get to it. Okay, in at number six slash And actually, only one letter is the shortest word on our list. It is the tiny and mighty &quot;si&quot;. Now, si has a couple One is just if, for which our word is but the other, It means yes, but at the same time nothing like In French, si sits alongside oui Let's say rebonjour to Julie. She can help us out with this one. So si is a form of oui, Si... I love this explanation. So &quot;oui&quot; is affirmative. You use it to affirm what someone has &quot;You like Doritos, right?&quot; &quot;Oui. Yes. Affirmative.&quot; Whereas, as Julie says, si is infirmative, meaning you use it to &quot;infirm&quot; - a word we don't use that often meaning render So to negate it. &quot;You don't like chocolate biscuits, do you?&quot; &quot;Si, I bloody well do!&quot; Si is the word you use to turn &quot;You dont like pizza.&quot; &quot;Si! J'aime la pizza.&quot; Who doesn't like pizza? So why do I reckon we Well, because in such situations, It's ambiguous. If I say to you, &quot;Mate, to my channel&quot;, then you reply with &quot;yes&quot;. You can mean either &quot;Yes, In which case, better fix that now. You're wrong, Rob.&quot; In which case, thank you. Likewise, using no would be just However, si would mean I was left in no and that you have already subscribed. By the way, I went off on a rant about si the bombastic &quot;doch&quot;, in another video, we do have a way to do that. In English, we can just say While those are undoubtedly unambiguous, Whereas in French, you can use si without sounding like a &quot;trou du cul&quot;. It's not rude at all, no. And it makes you sound Spanish or Italian, so... And that is why we need it. Our next word is all about politeness. It is tutoyer. So here I am talking to you, But if I were speaking French now, to either refer to you as &quot;tu&quot; Tu is the informal you Once I've concluded that you and I are and that I am going to address you as tu, to tutoyer: to address each other If, however, I've decided to afford you and have resolved to refer to you as vous, but vouvoyer. Tutoyer and vouvoyer on this list, because their usage relies that English simply doesn't have. If you don't have a formal and informal to these two words. But hold on a second, and informal you now, but we used to. You see, this whole time I've been I've essentially been vouvoyer-ing you. You see, traditionally you was the formal informal version was thou. So to tutoyer in English would Indeed, the word has been used Look at this quote from a Victorian It says, &quot;Tutoying still pervades that at the time, it was still common something that actually still happens in It's true, I tell thee. Now, I realise I'm dangerously close of thou, but I don't What I do want to suggest, though, in English, or maybe even this 17th I like that. But not to refer to using the word thou a Quaker nowadays, but to just refer &quot;At work, we mind our manners. At the pub, we tutoyer.&quot; What dost thou think? Up next, number four. And another untranslatable, connaitre. Any French learner can tell you verb and that it means to know. Except that it isn't, a commonly used verb However, connaitre and savoir You see, French, like quite a lot of other two different types of knowledge French speakers, without even thinking between knowledge of people and places, or of how to do something. So if in French, that we are acquainted, But if I wanted to express that I know, that'd be weird, but I would use savoir. &quot;Je sais combien tu peses.&quot; Another example: &quot;Je connais Paris.&quot; &quot;I know Paris&quot; because I've been there. But &quot;Je sais que Paris et &quot;I know that Paris is Check me out. Two different types of knowledge, Connaitre is all about cognition. Cognition, that's the word. Savoir, c'est un verbe. savoir, it's a verb. It's also a noun. Le savoir, meaning &quot;the knowledge&quot;. We say in French, savoir-faire, Yeah, in fact, you might have heard terms savoir-faire used in English. It means knowhow, or more But those aren't the only places where For example, the word savvy, &quot;Savvy.&quot; &quot;Savvy&quot; ...shares a Latin origin with savoir. We actually get it via Meanwhile, connaitre also already Julie mentioned &quot;cognition&quot;, from the same ancient Proto-Indo-European But actually, I think the closest related the French verb is our word &quot;recognise&quot;. Connaitre is like &quot;to recognise&quot;, Conceptually complicated, Having savoir and connaitre saves on Do I mean that I know of the existence have knowledge of how to speak it? I'm not telling you. Perhaps to ease the transition, we could get into the habit &quot;Ah, Paris, I cognise it well.&quot; By the way, if you're thinking that having more nuanced than English, think again, way when you consider that French doesn't do between &quot;to do&quot; and &quot;to make&quot;. &quot;I am *doing* my homework.&quot; &quot;Je fais mes devoirs.&quot; &quot;I am making a cake.&quot; &quot;Je fait un gateau.&quot; So French is welcome to do It can have make but were taking Or cognise. It needs work. Ok, lets make some more And we're into the top three This is a gorgeous one. It's another verb, And flaner means to go for a walk with no your surroundings as you go. It's not a hike and it's not rambling born out of 19th century Paris. And it's not simply a stroll In France, if you are &quot;un flaneur&quot; you are &quot;un reveur&quot;, a dreamer, Un flaneur. One poet who was a self confessed who described it as an almost He said the flaneur was &quot;the passionate the undulating, the moving, &quot;It's being at the centre of the world, from the world&quot;, an anonymous Okay, that's all a bit fancy pants, it's more than just a stroll. So next time you're in the big city, And while you're at it, Okay, while we're on the move, let's If we were to invent an English equivalent something like &quot;decountryfication&quot;. Depaysement is a feeling you get Depaysement is the sensation you feel when outside of your &quot;pays&quot;: It's a positive thing because you are but it can be also negative because you from your native land. So we've got the negative side It is homesickness. But we dont have a word for the positive of your normal environment. And actually, word for country &quot;pays&quot;, just about anywhere: inside your own if you change the decor enough. Oh my God. It's a bit like disorientation It can be negative or positive depaysement is untranslatable And that is why I think we should abduct and welcome it into our language. Okay, and here we are. We've reached the top, words I think we should steal. And it is the beautiful &quot;bouquiner&quot;. No, it's not a French swimming garment. Bouquiner is an activity. An activity Reserved for us &quot;word nerds&quot;. T-shirt. In my shop. Because bouquiner is Got to stop undressing during videos. Bouquiner doesn't apply to the diligent the focused devouring of War and Peace, both of which clearly have their Bouquiner is It is the gentle leafing through Un bouquin is another word for a book, teach you in school. You might actually be thinking, hold on, to the word &quot;book&quot;, isn't it? And you'd be right to point that out. It was almost certainly borrowed but French has taken that word and built You can have a &quot;bouquin&quot;, That's one of the sellers of second hand And you can also have this to read a book for the gentle pleasure of it. My untranslatable French word number one. Thank you so much to Julie for helping We actually had a little chat about funny into this video, so I'm going to pop it up Thanks to you for watching and for also If you want to hear me mispronouncing more you should check out my video about Or otherwise, if you've perhaps check out this video instead a rebonjour when Until then, a la prochaine.
