Today we are going to be looking at British food memes. Alright. Wait, can I predict one? Bottle of water. Is that the first one? A cup of tea, fish and chips. Is it all they think we have? First up. Those peas look like if someone melted the green soldiers on Toy Story. Why are they so green? Those aren't peas. We don't eat that. Do we eat that? It's chips. It's a battered sausage. Whoever told me to come to London owes me an apology. I'm sad to admit I've had this in my life. That sausage looks like it's been sitting there for days. Sorry. There's your apology. That's not a sausage bro. That is not. I don't know what that is. Why is it so white? Whoever cooked this meal is disappointing. No, they've messed up the presentation. It's not supposed to look like that. Presentation! There's no egg, there's no hash brown. There's no nothing. I've been eating food in England for three days. And I finally understand why Gordon Ramsay's mad all the time. Fair enough. That is true, yeah. Fair enough. "Use the spices they conquered for" "Make terrible food" Fair play, I'm not mad at it. It's not true, but I'm not mad at it. I mean, it is a bit true. Alright guys, so I get a lot of questions on how we make tea in America. So I wanted to show you how... No, no, no. Oh wait, no, no. Don't they like boil it. Yeah, I knew it. They boil it. No. So this is actually how Americans make tea. We pour our boiling water in. What? It's not that. We use two tea bags. Let them soak for about 15 minutes. Oh no. This is going to be bad already. This is how... They really make tea. This is how they do it? Wrong already? So we fill our pot with water. Then we boil our water. We pour our boiling water in. We use two tea bags. Let them soak for about 15 minutes. And pour that sugar in. And pour that sugar in. Then fill the rest with water. Pour that sugar in. What? Give it a little stir. Her teeth are going to fall out. And pour that sugar in. Oh my lord. No wonder they hate our food. Look what they're putting in there. Oh my goodness. That is an unholy amount of sugar. You take one sip of that, you're passing out. Then fill the rest with water. What a waste of time. Then we put it in the fridge. The fridge? That's how we make tea. You're making it wrong. The Americans just like diabetes. They put tea in the fridge. Get her arrested. I don't even know what to say. That is just ridiculous. That's not real, is it? That's real. That one's actually real. They actually drink that. Did you see how much sugar she put in there? That's sweetened iced tea. What? That's actually diabolical. The water to sugar to teabag ratio is horrible. No, you're horrible. That's terrible. Genuinely horrible. I'm reporting your account. I see it. Wait till I get home. For offensive content? Genuinely. Everything. That's personal, man. Genuinely hate speech. That's horrible. Wow. That's going to start another war. That's going to be the last thing. That's it. Okay. I think you're sufficiently triggered. We are. When British Chinese food comes up on my FYP. That's not the British. What is that? That's not even bad. That actually looks brilliant. That looks banging. No, no, no. What's going on in there? What's going on on that plate? Okay, so there's noodles at the bottom of it. That's about 25% of the fun. Yeah, okay. Then there's chips on top. Yeah. And including pork. You've got three different meals in one. Chicken and chips, curry and Chinese. That's actually really true. That is what British Chinese food is. I remember going to an actual Chinese restaurant. Yeah. And being like, what is this? This is completely different. That's not what I'm used to. Whers's all the yellow stuff. Best scran in the world. That is true. British tapas. To be fair that's great That's amazing. So when you look at that, would you be happy if you went to a British tapas night? Yeah, I'd be pretty happy. I mean, you've got everything you need. I would do this if I'm hosting the party to save money. That's it. That's what I'd do. That's the method, isn't it? Americans, I have a question. Question for you two. Would you guys do this in America? That looks banging. Yes. Butteh. A chip butteh. Do you guys do this? Yes. Wow. Okay. At a chippy? Yeah sometimes, but mostly just fish and chips. But if a chip butty was on offer? Yeah. It's good. Chip butty is the lengest thing in the world. It's so good. Lengest, the lengest thing. Wow. Okay. I don't think that'd work with American fries because they normally like to have them a bit more thin. Yeah. You've got to get the thick chips. Chips. Like chippy chips. Chip butty is amazing. Okay, stop. Okay, stop with the chip butty hate. It's great. Cucumber sandwiches. That was like primary school top tier. Yeah. Cucumber sandwich. For like a packed lunch. That's actually quite true. Okay, what is that in the top left, what is that? That's just bread. No, no. Pause. What's that? That's not real. No one here has had that. No, it's wet bread in the middle, isn't it? You say that like that's an explanation. Yeah, but I'm saying it is. Toast sandwich? A piece of toast sandwiched between two pieces of bread. No, no. Apparently that's an old English recipe. That isn't true. But crisp sandwich, 100%. I bet, everyone does that. This is a very famous clip from a UK show called Come Dine With Me. That's nasty bro. That guy's disgusting. On big TV. How can you post that on the internet? How can you make that video? The camera's right at his face. For Americans that don't understand, he's making food for other people as well. That's insane. I felt a shiver go down my spine. That was nasty. Not more chips. My mouth's already going dry. What is that? No, I might throw up. That looks like snot. What is that? That's like fingernails. Nothing wrong with that at all. Okay, that does look leng, that looks good. That just looks good. Wait, that looks good. It doesn't look good. Because I've had it before, I can imagine how that tastes. It just taste good. Your mouth is watering. You're just sucking up some saliva there. You've got the pastry. It's soft, it's nice. You've got the meat inside. It's very flavourful, very rich. Then you've got the chips to balance it out.. Then you've got some onions, because why not? Don't knock it until you try it. Please, Americans, right after making jokes on British people. Yes, it's true. It's so true. What do you mean? It's just like, why do you have individually packaged cheese slices? To make sure that the landfill gets filled up. That is awful cheese. I would eat it though. Oh yeah, I've seen this. Cheese and baked beans. They line up for hours. That looks like the first thing a dog would make. To eat after turning into a human. The chips and the curry sauce and the mash. I don't like that. This is class. This is amazing. The potato makes it. How is that less sloppy though? Beans and peas. Beans can be sloppy, but peas can't. That is really nice. Yeah, that jacket potato looks banging, I'll be honest. Today we're gonna try Gregg's since all you guys recommended that Love Gregg's. You guys love Gregg's? Love Gregg's. You better not diss it. No he's gonna say it's good look at him. The sausage roll looks so small in his massive hands. There you go. Good on you So there's no Gregg's in America? No. What? What? I've never got curry sauce from Gregg's ever. I didn't even know you can get curry sauce from Gregg's. Me neither. I don't think you can though. It's just a sausage roll. Maybe he's overdoing it a little bit. It is really good. I literally had one yesterday. Okay. Yeah. No, no, no. That's unjust what he just said. The favourite thing he's ever had in the UK. He's clearly never tried yum yums from Gregg's. Oh wow. He's never tried original chicken shop chicken. Okay. Never had Chinese food. If it's in the UK then it kind of counts. British people would be like, &quot;Can I get a tuna sandwich?&quot; That is literally how you're meant to say it. How else do you say it? Toona. No one pronounces it like that. Tuna. Not everyone talks like that. But you do. British people and their ability to turn every noun into an insult, By prefacing it with the word absolute is phenomenal. Oh man. You absolute melon. That is great. That is exactly right. You're an absolute mug mate. Yeah. You're an absolute sausage. You can put anything. You can. Absolute bookend. Yeah. In England you don't say, &quot;I'm going now.&quot; You slap your knees and say, &quot;Right.&quot; Which means, &quot;I should have left two hours ago.&quot; But I was too polite to interrupt you. That is true. Alright. Alright, well that's a good one to end on. Any last thoughts? Half of these allegations are wrong. They're not true. Allegations. Don't knock it till you try it. Come here and then you'll really see what it's like. What a day. What a day.
