Transcriber: Mohammed Basheer Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, my name is Art Benjamin What that means or I should say maths - and magic to do what I call &quot;mathemagics&quot;. But before I get started, I've got a quick question By any chance, did anyone happen to bring with them If you have one, perhaps and you're pretty comfortable I'll need a couple of people I see one... two... With the three of you, bring out your and let's give these volunteers Come on up. (Applause) Great. Over on this side, please. Awesome. Since I have not had the chance I need to make sure Would somebody get us started How about a two-digit number? Audience: 74. Arthur Benjamin: Oh, okay. That's fine! 74 And another... how about How about on this side? Audience: 39. AB: 39. Multiply 74 times 39 Make sure you get 2,886, Do each of you get 2,886? (Sighs) (Applause) I noticed that took some of us That's ok. I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying There's something called which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself. For instance 5 squared would be... 25. 6 squared would be... 36. 73 squared would be... something else. Yeah. (Laughter) On most of these calculators, that allow you to square What I'm going to try and you might test it - make sure but what I'm going to try and do is to square in my head, faster than they can do even using the shortcut method. But I'll ask these three people Each yell out a two-digit number, and if you would square the first one, I will try and race you to the answer. So quickly a two-digit number, please? Audience: 24. Arthur Benjamin: 24, great, next... What was that? Audience: 98. AB: 98... and one more... Audience: 26. AB: 26. Would you call out First volunteer: 576. AB: 576. Second volunteer: 9,604. AB: 9,604. Third volunteer: 676. AB: 676. Give them a round of applause! (Applause) Let me try to take this one step further. I'm going to try to square This time, I won't even write these down. I'll just call them out Anyone at all call out anyone on our panel verify the answer. If I get the answer right, If I make a mistake, A three-digit number, anyone? Audience: 576. AB: 576 is 331,776? Second volunteer: Yes. AB: Yes? Good! How about another three-digit number, Audience: 103. AB: 103 is 10,609. Way too easy! Audience: 125. AB: 125 is 15,625, but that's 5 How about another three-digit number, sir? Audience: 985. AB: 985 is 970,225. One more three-digit number, sir? Audience: 926. AB: 926 is 857,476? Thank you very much. (Applause) (Sighs) (Applause) Let me try to take this one step further. I am going to try to square I am not going to beat you but I will try to get the answer right. To make this a little bit more random, how about we use Each of you calls out a single-digit that will be a four-digit number One, Five, Seven, Seven. 1, 5, 7, 7, this will take me 3 million - (Sighs) (Laughter) 486,929? No? OK, don't tell me. The number was 1, 5, 7, 7. Oh, wait! 3 million - so far so good? Oh, is that were I went wrong? I never make a mistake, wait. Oh. 2 million, was everything else right? Volunteer: Yes! AB: Thank you very much. (Laughter) What's one million off? That's all I ask. (Applause) Now I would attempt to square But unfortunately, So, since we have reached although some of yours may go higher, I'm going to try to conclude by trying something even trickier. Let's take the first number Would you each enter 576 And instead of squaring it this time, and multiply it by any But don't make it too easy but just some random four-digit number. So you should have as an answer either a six-digit or possibly How many digits are on your answer, Seven. Seven. Six. Is there any possible way what six or seven-digit numbers Audience: No. AB: Good. Then I shall attempt the impossible, What I'd like each of you to do any six of your seven digits, or in your case five of your six digits in any order you do like. One digit at a time, I shall try So starting with your six-digit number, First volunteer: 8, 0, 9, 3, 8. AB: 8, 0, 9, 3, 8, Yes, that is one. You have got seven-digit number. Second volunteer: 4, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4. AB: Did you leave out the number six? AB: That's two. The odds of me getting all three would be one in 1,000: OK, any six of your digits. Really scramble them up this time. Third volunteer: 9, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4. AB: Did you also leave out the number six? Volunteer: Yes. AB: Great, and let's give all three Thank you very much. (Applause). For my next number... (Laughter) I have another question for the audience. By any chance, does anyone the day of the week If you think you know your Starting with you. What year if I may? Audience: 1992. AB: 1992, and what month? Audience: July. AB: July what? 3rd. Was that a Friday? Audience: Yes. AB: Yes, excellent. Somebody else? Yes sir, green shirt. What year? Audience: 1992 AB: 1992, and the month? Audience: June. AB: June what? Audience: 30th. AB: A Tuesday? Audience: Yes. AB: Excellent. Somebody else, Audience: 1995. AB: I am sorry sir, what year was it? Audience: 1995. AB: 1995 and what month? Audience: June. AB: June what? Audience: 26th. AB: 26th. Was that a Monday? Audience: Yes. AB: Excellent. I see a hand up I'll try something different here. If you are sure of your birthday, What day of the week was it? Audience: Thursday. Audience: 2002. AB: 2002. Did it happen to be on May 2nd? Audience: Yes. AB: Yes, but that is my daughter, (Laughter) I was there for that, on that Thursday. Anyway, I never tried that before. Do we have anybody here who doesn't know but would like to find out? Ok, now let's see. I'll see yours. Now, of course, if you don't know and you will probably believe me. But I don't want you to have to do that, There is an app for everything these days. So, I'll ask one of you here just So give us your year and then What year? Audience: 1995. AB: 1995. So type in 1995. Great. And what month? Audience: September. AB: September. And that should give you the calendar. Audience: 21st. AB: 21st. I believe, it was a Thursday. It was Thursday. Good. I'll tell you what, you know since you have the app with you, let's try something trickier. The app actually goes as far into as far back into the past as 1600. Don't go below 1600. Then we get off the Gregorian calendar (Laughter) So, what year would you like? Choose a year between Audience: 2730. AB: 2730. So enter 2730 into that. Audience: June. AB: June what? Audience: 13th. AB: 13, will that be a Friday? Audience: Yes. AB: Yes, and it'll be cloudy Thank you very much. (Applause) In fact, anybody else who wants see me in the lobby, perhaps in the break, Now, just a little bit of time left that I alluded to earlier when we had I am going to try to square requiring if you have a ten-digit Fell free to bring out your But to make my job more interesting I going to do this last problem so you can actually honestly hear what is going on in my mind, while I do a calculation of this size. Let's create a five-digit number. Why we just go up to this aisle, the first five people along the aisle, that will be my five-digit number. Three. Seven. Six. Nine. One. 37,691 squared. Yuck! Let me explain to you how I'm going to break the problem down I'll do 37,000 squared, plus, 691 squared, plus, 37,000 times 691 times 2. Add all those numbers together Now, let me explain one more thing. While I do this calculation you might hear creep into the calculation. Let me explain what that is. This is a phonetic code, that allows me to convert I store them as words, and later on I know it sounds complicated, it's not. I just don't want you to think, you're seeing something (Laughter) There's definitely definitely, definitely. Sorry. (Laughter) One last instruction Now who has got an answer Okay, enough of you. There is a 50% chance that I will make If I do, don't tell me just say, &quot;You're close or something,&quot; and I'll try and figure it out which If, however, I am right, whatever you do, don't keep it to yourselves. Make sure everybody knows because this is my big finish, OK? So, without any more stalling, here we go. I'll start the problem in the middle, Now, let's see - Oh my gosh - I will take advantage on that, 37 times 9 is 333, subtract 25,000 - do I believe that, yeah - - 51,134 OK - 51,000 becomes That seems right, I'll go on. Next, I do 37 squared which is 1,369, Take the 369 add that to light. 369 add that to light to get 420 million. Next, we do 691 squared that 700 times Raft, if I need it, raft, take the 477, add that to tomorrow to get 611,481? Audience: Yeah! AB: Yes, good. Thank you all very much. I hope you enjoyed mathemagics. (Applause)
