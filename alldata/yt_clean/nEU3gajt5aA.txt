Hello and welcome to Why, Tom? Why? Because a few weeks ago, We talked about doing this. And then we just went to lunch And you remembered, Well, I asked a few people, <i>(laughing)</i> and you were I did say yes. Entirely, entirely(!) So the producers have sent over I've not seen these. You've not steamed I haven't. They're all estimation questions. Oh... Furthest away in each round We start easy. We end up at this end. And I really-- The reason that we're First, lots of people have done that. And second, I really don't I really... So that one's worse Every time I watch <i>Hot Ones,</i> which by the way, I hope you don't mind. We hope you enjoy the free publicity Everyone taps out on And the rest, That's the one I'm worried about. How are you with hot sauce? I've not ever-- Mhm. About two or three. <i>(uproarious laughter)</i> So this is <i>Hot Ones'</i> This is meant to be the mild one. So, good luck. I'll open question one... ...which have been decorated with little fish. Is that on-theme? Is it a fish question? I think they just had some fish stickers Alright. &quot;How many tennis balls are used Oh my... god... How many tennis balls are used And at Wimbledon, there's a lot <i>(soft groan)</i> Alright. <i>(laughs)</i> I think we're gonna have different Ready? Twelve thousand. Sorry! Eight thous-- Okay, well we're both You know, it's-- No one's got a number in the hundreds. Do you wanna pull the answer? If this is 10,000, we're in trouble. What happens then? Oh okay, easy. The answer is... <i>(sputtered laughter)</i> ...55,000. Okay, we're both out. But you were out more, Crack the bottle. We got tortilla chips because A: we don't wanna and B: these are much cheaper. Good dollop. Okay, down the hatch. Graceful. <i>(chuckles)</i> I would've put the whole thing in my mouth, I'll do that moving forward. You know, it definitely registers, that one. Yeah? Alright. Which is very worrying. Question two. &quot;What is the equatorial circumference Okay. Okay, I'm not immediately 'Cause I know what... And... I know roughly the gravity of the Moon... <i>(snorts)</i> I'm just-- big numbers-- Here's a question, do you think I will be very surprised Through. I mean, I heard some zeroes over there. I've just realised that... ...I've written the exact same number I've written 8,000. <i>(laughs uproariously)</i> I have a horrible feeling Because... The Earth is what, like, Yeah, it's like... I was thinking it's about That feels about right. I don't-- I'm not sure I have. 'Cause the trouble with that is, I'll tell you this, But I'm ever so slightly closer. Ohh... This is Adoboloco - Island Wings, pineapple(!) cayenne pepper sauce. You are very much going Now that shouldn't do too much. Yeah? Alright. Definitely tastes of pineapple. We've got water, we've got milk. Mm-mm. I'm just gonna pre-write 8,000. Number three, this is a This is Los Calientes. Ingredient number one so we are already Great. &quot;How long is the first video I remember what it was. They were at the zoo, weren't they? Yeah, it was called &quot;Me at the zoo&quot;. Yeah, &quot;Me at the zoo&quot; or something. Mainly for the So Solid Crew reference, I've gone for 21 seconds. Two minutes. Ooh. Was it that long? Ugh, it probably was I don't know. I don't know. I mean... <i>(wheezes)</i> Eighteen seconds. Yeah, I just thought they would've done Looks... There's no flushing Not yet, no. That was... Alright. Mhm. Not a problem, <i>(chuckles)</i> Alright. That was the first one that sort of But, still not too bad. Your question. My question. Heh. &quot;Name the other Slow-Mo Guy.&quot; <i>(both laughing)</i> I just want one that I can win. &quot;How many people attended the So that's Glastonbury. Is that what that is, Worthy Farm? They phrased that really carefully. Well done to the question team, I think is different to &quot;first Worthy Farm,&quot; If it isn't, that whole section This is the first one where... ...I have no idea Same. I mean, the comedy answer <i>(laughs)</i> I think I'm gonna have to go... I mean, it's a question for a reason. Or, maybe Glastonbury was just on Alright. So I did not go with the same. I went with 1,200. <i>(snorts)</i> Eight hundred. We both took a zero off. We both took a zero off. It's almost like we've got the same I don't know why I mean, I have a if you'd gone just a little bit higher-- Now I've seen these numbers, It's gotta be more than that. If you put anything higher than that, Oh my god, I'm so sorry. It's 1,500. Not a bad answer. You invite someone on the channel, Sorry. Which hot sauce is this, This is... Seventh Reaper, alright. Oh, it does. <i>(weak laughter)</i> That was a sarcastic &quot;Oh good(!)&quot;, Alright, I'll say this to you now. It's been a pleasure being on your channel. Has it though? Up to this point. But this may be one of Yep. Yep. The thing about tortilla chips is, You can't just... Yeah. You can't swallow like a pill. How're you feeling? Doing all right.

I mean, it's called Burns &amp; McCoy... Mezcaline Oaxacan hot sauce. I'll be crawling out of here today. Trying to see if I have a sheen yet. &quot;How many words are in What font was he using back then(?) <i>(chuckles)</i> Quill. I can't put 12,000 again. No. Shakespeare's longest play. So it's... That's a decent chunk How many words are on a page? How many words can you say in-- How many words can Is it three hours? It feels about three-- These are good questions. 'Cause they're all ones I feel like Mm-kay. What'd you put? 80,000. I put 25,000. So what's in the middle of these two? The middle of these is... And it is... It's 30,000. Sorry. Hell! Hell's bells! I'm really sorry, Gav! I just gotta get better at guessing! These were the ones These are the ones that are like, These are the ones I'm worried about! And then... mmph! Sorry! So that's the end of the front half. This is... This is I think this one was worse, y'know. Really? Slightly. I mean, the biggest ingredient Hmm. The next one is This is collard greens Good. I remember being in Alabama Love him. And... ...he was impressed I knew They're not a British thing. No, I'd never have... I've never had them until I came here. Same with, like, grits and such. <i>(whispers)</i> God... &quot;How big is the world's largest IKEA, In square metres?! Oh... So you've gotta take... You gotta work out and then like, multiply... What's a football pitch? I actually don't know I know an American football field which is about 100 metres. So that's gonna be about 100 by 30. So that would be... 3,000. I feel like I got my maths A yard is what, 91 centimetres? A yard, at this level of estimation, yards and metres Part of me is like, I need to... ...I need to absolutely get some... ...get some hot sauce down me I need a comeuppance here. Part of me is wondering Because I'm really over-competitive. Have to redo the intro, about the Yeah. 800,000. <i>(stifled snicker)</i> <i>(chuckle pop)</i> I've done... I bet the smallest one I thought-- I figured a kilometre And now that seems So 1,000 by 1,000 would be a million. It might be more than a million. This might be the worst guess I've had. 65 thousand. I was way out! I was way, way out! Really?! 65 thousand square metres. I feel like IKEAs are bigger than that. Yeah, it's very hard to-- I was thinking, there must be I was thinking kilometre by... No, it's... You're spot on. Right! when there's a square involved, I feel. Okay. I'm so relieved. Oh boy. This is-- This is phenomenal. I'm so glad you invited me on this. Also I'm coming in at I've had no warmup. Alright, Collards N Green hot sauce. Oooh. That is a lot. You're going off the deep end there. And I kinda want to pour some of this off, ...at this point. No, no. We gotta-- Here we go. Good night, Tom Scott. Oh, that tastes lovely. Good? Mmm. I mean, they are meant They can't be all horrendous. It's... It's not mild. I'll say that much. That's not mild. <i>(giggles)</i> It tastes delicious. It tastes like collard greens. That hits the back of your throat... ...really quickly. Yeah. And I think that's a factor-- I don't know if you can see it. Are you getting Yeah. Alright! Excellent! This video's heating up. That's a... good hot sauce. Kinda already want I'll keep going. Number seven is... Yeah, Tyrfing's [turf-ings] Curse. Alright, ingredients: red onion, vinegar, baby carrots, orange juice... Where are the chiles? Oh, here we go. Habanero, My tongue's on fire. I didn't like the last bit of this. No. I didn't either. That's... mmph. Weirdly, the underside Interesting. How'd it get under there? I don't know. I did make the mistake, And I don't know why I did this. and then I turned it 180 degrees and I don't know why I did that! Number six is a hell of a thing Yeah. I don't envy you &quot;When was the first Hmm. I read an article about this and I can remember It's gonna be for one of the... We probably shouldn't talk to each other, So I... I was torn here. I thought it might be, like, <i>Lotus 1-2-3</i> in which case I've gone way too early. But I feel there might be something like So I said 1981. <i>(long wheeze)</i> Ah. <i>(joins wheezing)</i> Well... Your answer. Let's... No, what were you thinking? I just thought it'd be some sort of... somehow electromechanical Maybe? 'Cause it would've been after the... No, 'cause I was thinking, Just with characters? Whew. 1979. <i>(slow exhale)</i> You are on it! I just assumed it would be you know, impossible. Tyrfing's Curse. So that was the worst answer yet, <i>(snicker)</i> I mean, I did say the biggest IKEA When I miss, I miss hard. I missed by a couple decades there. Alright... Here we go. <i>(both wheezing)</i> I mean, you're not immediately I think I might be all right. Okay. It's like you can feel And you don't know Yeah. So some of them are coming like... Yeah. I think that one's... We're on number seven. I'm proud of us. Maybe we should start adding I guess? That's gonna come back Oh, that one, Okay. Oh, hang on. It's Da' Bomb. This is the one This is the one that-- &quot;What was the average during the 20th century, Huh. I don't know. You've got a lot of polar... I wonder if the poles really skew I was thinking that. It's an obvious thing to say, Yep. I'm just very surprised to find that... Do you know what percentage of the Oh, I mean, if that's a question <i>(giggles)</i> Yeah, it's almost 90. Okay, hang on. We... I'm just gonna pick the most average place and pick the most average I'm thinking mediocre autumn day in Milton Keynes. Thirteen. You probably have this. I was just in the back Singapore, and... I think I've got it wrong, Deserts. Although, That's true. So, if this is sixteen... Double bomb? <i>(giggles)</i> Sorry! <i>(strained)</i> It's 13.9! It's an average... It's a mediocre autumn day Gav, I'm sorry. I really am. Honestly, I can't be annoyed, You are within one degree of that. I wasn't planning this. I swear. I assumed this was gonna be 50-50. It's the worst case scenario, And there's no clean sweep. So it's really just as bad without being a clean sweep for you. Which like, in terms of, being a good host, appearing graceful It's also-- I'm not in physical pain. But let me tell you, emotionally, I feel terrible. All I'm learning is that for when we eventually do I get to pick the game. <i>(snorts)</i> I didn't even have my nose over it. That has just set every saliva gland Like someth-- Oh my god! Okay, yeah. That's... A little bit of that. That's a solid choice. That's... Sorry, I swore there. That's okay, we'll bleep it. I suspect we'll be doing Um... Good-- Good night. <i>(strained) It's wet at the moment. Okay. This is not immediate. Oh my god. Okay! <i>(wheezes)</i> Oh my god. <i>(whispers)</i> This is bad. Oh, it's still going up. Oh god. And I've just swall-- <i>(cough)</i> Just gonna... I'm trying not to grin too much. Honestly, it's still going up. This is-- This is the one <i>(deathly shudder)</i> If-- <i>(wheezes)</i> I have to reset my whole scale! Okay! Everything else was a one! Okay! My tongue's getting bigger. <i>(chuckles)</i> It's expanding. <i>(cough)</i> ...all around! <i>(hack)</i> It's climbing the walls. I can't open my eyes! I think it's still building, y'know. There's a lot of spit happening. Okay. 'Kay. I wanna move and run around. Mhm. Yeah, take a-- Yeah, maybe a little stroll. The middle of my vision is good. All of this is fuzzy. Really?! What's-- So the next one after that It's meant to be. Whew... I feel like I wanna hiccup. I just-- <i>(sigh)</i> Just don't know what the-- what the most comfortable position is. Okay. Maybe a... ...Water? Milk? I'm gonna try for-- <i>(cough)</i> I just wanna see if I can... Yeah. Yeah. Okay. But um... I might be over the hump. That went and invaded Yeah, it-- <i>(chuckles)</i> I can feel it moving The first words you said were: &quot;It's-- It's just wet.&quot; And then... <i>(chuckle)</i> Then-- Then it went places. Yeah. I'm gonna have a little sip. I think water can make it worse. I don't know. Okay so-- <i>(ahem)</i> The problem is just trying to shift Mhm. Ooh, there's little pockets of it. <i>(shaky exhale)</i> So now we know that if you are You can start at, like, five. Yeah, these are just -- <i>(ahem)</i> -- nice. Those are just nice hot sauces. Some of these were worrying. That had a bit of a kick, That-- 'cause I could feel the potential And it just left the building. &quot;How old was the I assume it's in human years. Typically-- They say, what, a dog year is meant to be Yeah, but you think of some cats I don't know why I'm trying to give A lot-- Wait, as of what year? I assume that, &quot;How old <i>was</i> So I assume that-- I was gonna phrase this more delicately. This is a complete gap in my knowledge, I don't know how long... I don't know how long a dog lives. I should know that. <i>(sigh)</i> I'm gonna regret this. I'm gonna say 32 years. Because I feel like that's the longest they could be. I think you've got this, 'cause I mean how long... like... How long does an average dog live? I don't know. I think... I think sadly it's not as long as a cat. It's... your answer. This is-- This by the way is for Fifteen out of ten heat warning. 29 years and five months. I think that's your hot sauce. Why did it have to say <i>(both wheezing)</i> Oh mate, I'm sorry. Ogh...! I could've just put 27. You could've just turned this down. I've just touched my eyes. Oh no! Oh no! I think I'm all right. I just put my fingers in my eyes. Gav, I'm so sorry! Aah. Aah. You must have... ...smarter YouTube friends for a more equal game. I didn't-- The smart ones said no! I genuinely thought you'd be Yeah. I'll see you over there. Yeah. Sorry. <i>(clears throat)</i> <i>(snorting choke)</i> <i>(hacking)</i> I'll describe this before Yeah. Imagine a small steamroller. <i>(wheezes)</i> But the flat roller is Yeah. <i>(snicker)</i> Yeah. ...slowly driving towards That was a full-force arrival... ...but it had no mass to it. I swear they don't put the Well, the last one is the Yeah. I mean, that was Yeah. If I was rating them so far, This would be on this side of this. Yeah. Alright. So what happened there is... ...if I can describe this one... It was, you know, really slow. Didn't really understand Mhm. This one came in much higher. Yeah. Just never got to the same height. Alright! But much more relieving. And you're still not on the milk. Still not on the milk. <i>(ahem)</i> I feel like I am getting from the last two. But I think with that one, Mind you, the ice cream's Yeah. You got the eraser. So this is made with the Apollo pepper, the new world record But look at the liquidy... Yeah. Yeah. Okay! &quot;What is the current fastest in minutes, seconds, I know nothing about video games! Really?! So I-- Honestly, my first thought ...half an hour. But it says minutes, seconds, Speedruns, sort of stopwatch-based So they just stop the clock and... <i>(ahem)</i> And sometimes, Minutes, seconds, milliseconds. you might get people ending which is why milliseconds are important. Is what I'm trying to say. <i>(sniffle)</i> Okay. Which--? I'm trying to visualise... I don't know where to start with this! There's gotta be warp pipes involved. ...Sure. So, you really don't play games? I played video games I think... since I seriously played I was never a console kid. So, I don't even know... <i>(heavy worried breathing)</i> In hindsight, I should've I should've put like... I should've either done 12,000, or I should've gone for, but what I've done is and then just put some Okay, I've gone for <i>(snort)</i> Mm. I feel-- <i>(laughs)</i> I feel like... I might know <i>(titter)</i> I don't-- I know I've seen some I just don't know which one So what I need here Like, over fifteen is where That's... <i><b>HAH!</b></i> Yeah. It's just under five minutes. That's... <i>(heavy relieved sigh)</i> <i>(growling sigh)</i> It is. It's not for me. That is a significant dab. <i>(stammering)</i> You're going all-out. I can't go half-assed on this, No, I guess not. It is YouTube after all. ...Oh. Seems pleasant maybe? I see why you said it's just wet. <i>(coughing profusely)</i> <i>Haah! Haah!</i> <i>(frantic gulping)</i> I was almost disappointed! <i>(breathless chucking)</i> D'you wanna go have a walk by the paint?! <i>(heavy panting)</i> <i>aa<b>oOOOW</b>ww!</i> That takes ten seconds, That was interesting. Your reaction at the beginning was... Almost disappointment, even in you. <i><b>AAah!</b></i> So... I'm gonna dial 9-1, The subtitles team... do a really-- On the milk! Mmm. The subtitles-- team do a great job. <i><b>AGH!</b></i> Because... I had to 'cause they --<i> (gluck)</i> Like... The subtitles should not So-- <i>(retching cough)</i> I can hear it in your throat actually! Get that milk down. Do you feel all right? But in this case, subtitle team... ...go on... go ahead and... ...just add all the ...in these vocalisations! <i>(chuckles)</i> &quot;Wet blubbering&quot;. <i>(pained groan)</i> <i>(giggling)</i> <i>(loud gulp into retching moan)</i> Is it just continuing to build, Do you think you're <i>(mouthing &quot;It's going up&quot;)</i> <i>(giggling)</i> <i>(pained whine)</i> Haah! I still feel mine. I can't imagine what you're Do you wanna get the Yes! Haah! <i>(panting)</i> For both of us. We should have pre-opened this. <i>(anguished shout)</i> Let me take care of this. It just... <i>(inner burp)</i> Ugh. <i>(wheezing giggles)</i> Ooh, that's nice and soft. Well, you won't struggle It has been waiting there, Oh, that's just-- Okay, that's just... <i>(shivering moan)</i> Yeah, I'll give it a go. Mmm. I'm good. See that's fine. That gets rid of-- Can you pass the-- the kitchen roll? Aah...! It just comes back. It just-- <i>(bellows)</i> <i>(shouts)</i> <i>(tired moan)</i> We've come a long way. <i>(hoarse)</i> Uh-huh.
