Ours was quite simple. I just had a one-night stand with this man and I never knew I was going to get married to him. Honestly, I was like, &quot;Okay, hey.&quot; I gate crashed his party, that's where I met him, dead drunk. And I met the whole family, mother-in-law, father-in-law, you guys know my family, right? Anil, Sunita... And I was dead drunk. But they still accepted me and said, &quot;Wow, what an amazing future daughter-in-law.&quot; They welcomed me with open arms. Lovely. And... Ya. And we didn't have all this proposal and all. You see, I'm much older than you. We didn't have Instagram. So, we didn't give a shit. He just told me. He just said, &quot;Look, we're getting married.&quot; Oh, he just told you? Yeah, yeah. So, you've not even said no to that question till now? No. I wish he asked me again. Maybe I'd say, &quot;Fuck no. Are you crazy? I'm not doing this again.&quot; But that didn't exist in the 90s, right? Consent. Consent. Especially when it was with Bollywood. Yeah. So, you guys dated for how long? Five years. So, actually, it's 30 years I've been with this man. These are all babies. I mean, honestly, I don't know what... I just turned 30. Are you rubbing it in? No, no, no, not at all. So, what was it like? Did he really just call you one day and say, &quot;We're getting married&quot;? No, no. We were in 1900s. Do you guys know? Oh, you're too young. Did you know that there was a 1900s? A nightclub called 1900s? No, I'm sorry. I thought you were saying it as an era. - Wait, wait. Guys don't be stupid. For God's sake. Get with the program. There was a nightclub - 1900s. Are you seriously joking? Wait, wait, wait. Are you telling me that there was a time before 1990? I'm going to smack you all. How old are you people? They are 2200s, I'm guessing You guys are very stupid. I just want to tell you there was a nightclub called 1900s. Where was this nightclub? At the Taj. At the Taj. In the Colaba Taj? Yes, Colaba Taj. Taj Land's End has just come up now, you millennial. I'm talking about old Taj Colaba. I was there. We were drunk. We were partying. He says, &quot;Okay, we're getting married.&quot; So I said, &quot;Okay. Fine&quot;, in between my tequila shots. That was it. We didn't do this proposing, getting down on our knees for Instagram, speech. No, no. But when did y'all get sober? I think after the wedding. Then it hit me. What have I done? Deep, how have you been, man? Man, it's been a very long journey. I am engaged now. Thank you. That's how my parents react as well. So that's happened, man. It's kind of cute. Lots of Instagram likes, photos. That's the best thing about getting engaged. People just judge the ring you've given her. People judge the ring? Yeah, people really fucking judge. People told you or people told her? People told me. They won't tell her. Because I think they're scared to tell the woman that hey... She's probably not told you what her friends... Who did you ask for advice? Do you know about rings? I don't. Actually, one of her friends leaked her Pinterest board to me. Even I took my wife's Pinterest board. And then I found a ring according to that. And then I told her, &quot;Oh, you know, I'm so smart and I did it.&quot; And she was like, &quot;That's why I kept it there.&quot; Oh, wow. Where did you propose? Yeah, I proposed in Japan. Yeah, which is very, very... Was she with you also in Japan? Or, you went... No, no, we went. We went for a trip and she wasn't expecting it. And I proposed. It was in Andheri East, Kanakia, Paris. Presents Japan. So, yeah, man, it was really cute. Where I went down on one knee. She wasn't expecting it. I had a photographer and everything ready. Great backdrop. And I had this speech. And I gave her the full speech. Which was like written from the bottom of my heart. And she didn't register anything. And then I had to, at dinner, repeat the whole speech again. Man, that's great. You had a chance at making a better draft also. Yeah, I did, actually. I guess the takeaway is that if you are proposing, you can just say whatever the fuck you want. Because that's the one chance you get to pick all the fights. &quot;You know, you're crazy, but I'm still tolerating it.&quot; Yeah, in that position, you don't register anything. Right. Right? Because you're just like this. So you're like, &quot;I have never liked this about you.&quot; Yeah, see, this is the part that's getting recorded. Yeah. How've you been Jose? Where have you been in your relationship? Struggling, thank you so much for asking. I'm good, Raunaq. Thanks for having me here again. Raunaq has some old tweets of mine. He's archived everything. Yeah. That's why whenever he says I'm doing Relationshit, I'm like, &quot;Yeah, what time? What time? What time, bro?&quot; Those tweets are his own nudes that he himself tweeted. Correct. So to save other people, he's not releasing them. How have you been, man? We're doing good. - We're doing fantastic. When I first came to this show, I could see properly. Now I need glasses to like read. You have reading glasses now? I have my reading glasses. That's cool. Did you also go to 1900s? Madarchod. Right. No, we're good in our relationship. We're damn good. And someone has been spreading rumours that me and my wife are getting divorced. I don't like this, guys. I'm really sorry for doing that, bro. I knew it. It did come from the handle Raunaq Rajani also. No, I posted a picture saying that I bought a cuddle pillow. You guys know what a cuddle pillow is? What's a cuddle pillow? I knew you wouldn't know, Raunaq. It's just a cuddle pillow, you know? You hold it when you're sleeping because insane people like to hug through the entire night. But normal people, after about 30 seconds of cuddling, they're like, &quot;Chal hatt na, bhenchod.&quot; You know, when I posted it to my stories, they said, &quot;Ohh, biwi ka kya ho gaya? Huh? Divorce ho gaya kya? I was like, bro, do y'all not hang out with other people? What is this? Anyway, I just want to say, - we're not getting divorced. - Yeah. I was never married. They were all actors. The child is a great actor. Does the cuddle pillow save your marriage? No, nothing can save marriage. But the cuddle pillow will just keep it going. What do you guys do? Do you guys cuddle all night? Or do you guys stop after 15 minutes? Are you crazy? I have been married for almost 30 years. We don't cuddle anymore. Yes. We don't do that shit. Yeah, we don't do that shit. We do a handshake and go to sleep. Yeah. See you in the morning, bro. Just like a high five. Yeah. Take care, bro. Have you guys heard of those pillows? Those long distance pillows where if you are living in a different country with WiFi, you can just like, I don't know, slap each other's butts or something. - What are you talking about? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can pass sensation through the pillow? Yeah, yeah. So, it's like if I hug this back, then through WiFi, my pillow hugs her back. Is that right? After a point, she's like, &quot;Raunaq, I don't need you to do the WiFi part. We'll sort it out at home. Thank you so much. Phone de.&quot; Dude, can you imagine if someone hacks into my WiFi pillow and cuddles with my wife. Oh my God. I'm already angry. It's your boy, Michelle Obama. Ouch. Kamala, we're very upset A few quick announcements I am performing my stand up Amsterdam, Dublin on these dates. Yeah, children's day baby! Woo! Tickets on Bookmyshow. Tickets in the pinned comment. Also, go buy the merch for the show. It's a t shirt. It's a hoodie. It says stay toxic because you should. The tickets are in the pinned comment Yeah, go back and watch your frickin show. And never, ever, ever, ever, ever, That the Fiat Padmini is not a good car. Because, my friend, I will promise. So, what does your daughter think? Does your daughter feel afraid that you guys are distancing? No, no. What? Like, you know how sometimes kids see their parents and they're like, oh, are they breaking up? What's this cuddle pillow? Who's this third person? My kid doesn't think like that because she never sees us together anyway. So, we've been conditioning for some time now. No, no. She's very secure like that. That's cool. But we are insecure because now my kid is going... She's eight. She's going for her first camp. It's just going to be two days but we're behaving like she's leaving for another country. She's with a trolley. She's going to another country? Got her a visa. No, no. She's going to Lonavala. We're damn stressed. We're like, &quot;Should we go and camp outside the camp?&quot; What are you stressed out about? Just being away from her. Yeah, yeah. I understand. I feel you. Thank you, Maheep. I went through the same thing. So, what did you do when your kids... What? I don't literally feel you. I do feel you. I don't know what you're doing in there. What was he doing? Are you crazy? No, no. What the hell just happened? Now I understand how the arguments happen on that show. Maheep, can I ask you? As someone who's got kids who are all grown up now, what advice do you have for him that his kids are going out of town for the first time? Thanks, Raunaq. This is the one thing I don't want to think about. But yeah. What's the one advice you have? My advice is it's going to get even worse, honey. This is just the beginning. As they grow older and they start going out partying then you wake up the whole night. It's like a nightmare. Oh shit. I already knew this but hearing someone say it... Yeah, yeah, yeah. And like now Sanjay had so many girlfriends so he knows what he did with those girls so he's like overthinking with his daughter and I don't know about you but... Maheep, you want to read the first one? Oh, do I have to read this? Yeah, you got to read it. I don't have my glasses haan. So spare me. Okay. You want to borrow his? 1.25. Number. This is what age does to you. It's a fucking bitch. Yeah. That was the logo of 1900. These were the zeros. Okay. Now it's a very long sad story here. Okay? What the fuck is this? I'm confused. Are you understanding this? Or am I reading it badly? I don't get it. I don't understand. When she says she means - shipping, she doesn't actually mean it. It means shipping. Not DHL shipping. What does it mean? It means like they are like shipping. They are rooting. They are trying to like set them up. Is this millennial lingo? But you know it's a 51-year-old reading it. You should have changed this na for me. Raunaq, your show. I think the best friend is also a bitch. I think the best friend is the problem. She is the big problem. I don't like that. It's a big red flag. Yeah, yeah. Huge red flag. Women should stand up for women and she needs to be axed. ASAP. Yeah. Women should stand up for women, okay? Stand up. Right. Okay. So you are saying that her best friend was a bad... TWAT. So this is a possible thing. People for the sake of narratives of content do make up shit. Maheep you have been posting a lot. Have you always been posting? Have you started posting more since the show came out? Yeah, yeah. I am learning still. But yeah. Now my show has dropped. I hope you guys have watched it. So yeah. It's called Sacred Games. So now after the show You must've become more of a social media celebrity than you used to be. How is that going? Yeah, yeah. I am. I am. I am learning. And I am posting a hell of a lot because I am trying to keep the traction on so that you guys re-watch Bollywood Wives. So once promotions are over you are going to stop posting? I mean there has to be something exciting like a proposal in Japan which at the moment is not there. But if there's something exciting I'll post. Maheep, can you follow me today? I am following you. 100%. But there has to be something exciting. She's been following you with a binocular since the beginning. And, is there pressure? Like the management telling you &quot;Hey man, your social media game. Let's make some six reels. Let's make some ten reels.&quot; Yeah, yeah. But they know I'm lazy and I don't. My manager, Arbaaz, is here somewhere. He knows. I just can't. And his elder brother is on Bigg Boss. Are you crazy? Don't worry. I'll take it out. And do you also feel like because you're on a reality show people film your life for a while and then they edit it out, put it out. Right? Which is kind of like what this person is doing. Vlogging. What do you think about when you see your life playing out and then when you see the edited version? Oh. It's... It's a bitch. Because you know what? We're not acting. It is our personality. So you're judged for you as a person. So that's not nice. So when the comments come they're personal. But I learn to deal with it. What's the worst comment that really got to you? That I'm a bitch. That I'm a bully. Do I look like a bully to you guys? I'm so nice. No, no. Very nice. Very nice. No, no. Very good. Very good. Supportive of content. Isn't it exactly like I went to a boy's school, okay? So like I grew up with friends constantly saying ya, ya, ya that girl is my ex. And that girl has no clue you exist. But is there anybody here who thinks that ya, it's fair. It's just business. Share the revenue. The boyfriend... Show me the money. I think they were sharing the revenue only abhi tak. Isiliay yeh problem ho gaya. One sec, one sec, what do you do, bro? Do people do this often? Do people just take a... Yeah? Can you tell us like a story? Whoa, whoa, bro. Please. Bro. I already admitted that they were actors. Okay? He keeps teasing us with soft launching his cuddle pillow. There's a guy there who has something he wants to say. What do you want to say, bro? Whoa, whoa, whoa, bro. Yes, yes. Please take names. Okay, okay. Give us the name. I promise you. I'm saying it on camera. Aai shappat. I'll mute the name. So I'll not mute it na? Bata de, naam bata de. That's good because he was not going to do that anyway. Please carry on. Do you guys know @*#)%&amp;#(? One sec, one sec, do you hate him personally? Because how do you know his engagement? You worked with him? Do you know his engagement? It was in Tokyo. Which I posted by mistake apparently now. Acha, bata bata bata bata. So whose BMW was it? Was it @$#*!'s BMW? But one second. It was a BMW-- I love it. So, but did he... what? She knows your flatmate? Right. That's so crazy. She's like she's like &quot;Tu Monopoly kyu khel raha hai?&quot; &quot;Tere paas ghar hai na.&quot; &quot;Tere paas gaadi bhi hai.&quot; Listen, I've never witnessed a comments section in real life before. Wild, bro. That guy's comments 1,000 likes. Uske neeche Aye mai bhi tha udhar. Mai dekh raha tha udahr se. But here we could see you, friend. I have one question. He he must have done it with a sense of satire, right? No? So it's like There's no jokes in it. It's like a real Yeh bhenchod (audience's flatmate) bhi kam nahi tha. I'm the comment which is right at the bottom. So Tum log #$@( ke peeche bhaag rahe ho. What about @$#*!)? I'm the comment below that. Call for sex. Service available. Bro, this is wild. I was not expecting this when I left my house today. Holy shit. Has your friend's life changed? Because everyone now thinks he's a billionaire. Wow. Yeah. It worked out for everyone. Except you, it seems. I'm reading from here now. I'm in my 60s. 4782 They were the OTP of the group. The one true pair. Yeah. This is not this is not millennial lingo. Yes, it is. I don't know. Maine kuch nahi kiya, bhai. I'm just reading this, guys. What the fuck? Just two more lines. Shit! Oh! Shit! So it's a it's a 10-mark question. Somehow in this crazy story the luckiest person is the dead person. That's fucked up, man. - That's really wrong. That was not a joke, guys. Guys, be serious. - We're being serious. - Correct, correct. But it's a good question. How long we should ask the audience like how long would you guys How long should you wait? Correct. So this I think this used to happen like in villages earlier if like the husband died then like the brother or someone would just marry her because that time they thought women were cows or something. No, I don't think that really happened. So they're spreading rumours about villages to you. No. They used to do that. You guys know this, right? No. I don't know this. Hum Aapke Hai Koun mein it had happened. Correct. Oh, now it's legit. All this while I was fucking lying. This does happen. I've not watched that documentary. I watched that documentary and I've never taken the stairs after that. I like it. He's gotta tell her that I also lost a best friend so you have to fill in that vacuum. It's your job and she does all the work. And then what he can do is like Oh, you have to become my best friend. Oh, my best friend used to make out with me. Now she has to do what the best friend used to do. You said you went to a boy's school. Yeah, that's what we did in school, bro. Did you guys not do that? What? You're my best friend. Let's cuddle. We didn't waste our parents' money on cuddle pillows. I bought it with my first salary. But is anyone thinking that this best friend is also an asshole? Because obviously he must have told his best friend that I like this chick. He's gone and got married to her. Maheep, I've got to tell you. When you say men stand up for men they're not gonna applaud. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Your moral judgment is absolutely right. But that's a different show altogether. Technically, technically it's not two-timing because ek ka time khatam ho gaya hai. Vo ek hi time bacha hai. This is fucked up, guys. Yeah, yeah. This is very dark, guys. Yeah, yeah. He showed up at the funeral his girlfriend is crying. He's like, &quot;Samay samaapth.&quot; AAPKA SAFAR YAHI... But how much time? What he wants to know is what is the mathematical formula of, uh... Do you think five months Does someone say five months? Five years? It depends on how devastated. How devastated? What if he's chill? Yeah. Can I ask you, are you seeing someone right now? Okay. Are you single because they died? Okay, okay. Imagine you're still with him and he died. Yeah, I'm feeling bad now. You wanted to kill him when you were broke up. I'm feeling bad to ask you but I want to still ask you. How long was that time that you would be devastated? That you'd be like, Okay, fine. I'll date someone else. Let him be dead now. So that means one year. Yeah. Okay, okay. Do you think it's fair that he tells his girlfriend that, look, I love you and I'm in this relationship right now but I've always had a crush on that girl. Then there'll be two dead men. The girlfriend should know, right? Yeah. She's so nice as a person. She is... You're too sweet, man. You know what? First of all, I'm really amused by the fact that none of us suspected that this guy killed the boyfriend. But dude, you know, you know what's really creepy to me, dude? That this guy might have a boner at the funeral. This guy walked off. He's like, I'm not dealing with this fucking bullshit. I just came from three funerals this morning. Respect death, my friends. See, he's a shit friend for sure. Shit friend and a shit boyfriend. But in his narrative, he thinks that this girl and I were always meant to be. We are Ross and Rachel and it's finally going to happen that we can be together. No one has bothered to ask that girl if she's still interested. What's up? Thank you for your support. Baby, I did good. I did good. The girl's probably The girl's probably not interested. But if he never asks, he'll never know and that's what he thinks. This guy's like, I think he should wait for the girlfriend to die. We have it. And if he's killed one boy, he can kill another girl. What's... Imagine if the girlfriend dies. That guy died and now he asks her out and she says no. A big round of applause for all my panelists. Please give it up for Jose Covaco. For Maheep Singh. Maheep Kapoor. Maheep Singh. What did you call me? Maheep Singh is a friend of ours. He's another comedian. Is that not a red flag? Wait. Let's discuss this now. Are you crazy? One more death. Maheep, I just want to ask you aapki mummy kaisi hai? It's just another guy. It's just another guy. I'm sorry. Usually, you know, the thing is, you've done us the favour of coming on the show but usually, it's just the loser comedians who agree to come. One second, one second. Don't put us down - for your fuck up. - So smart. for the camera give it up for Jose Covaco. Maheep Kapoor. Deep Chhabria. My name is Raunaq Rajani, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much.
