Okay today I'm going to be doing the first ever gold Japanese foil ball challenge. So I'm going to be turning this pile of golden foil into a Japanese polished foil ball. And then after if it works out, I'm going to be putting it in my vacuum chamber to see what happens because in my previous video, I got a lot of requests to put the foil ball in the vacuum chamber becuase I calculated that it had some air bubbles in it . And I'll also be showing you what happens when you drop this very thin gold leaf metal in the vacuum chamber. Here's what happens in air. But what happens when we suck all the air out of the vacuum, will it just drop like a rock? Let's check it out after I make my ball. And finally I'm going to be showing you an awesome thing I discovered while doing these experiments what happens when you let the air in in gold foil in the vacuum chamber. It's quite amazing. One of the coolest things I've done in my vacuum chamber. Okay first let's make my gold foil ball. *E P I C M U S I C P L A Y S* Okay, now we'll start pounding it into a sphere. *M O R E E P I C M U S I C* Really looking like a solid ball now, but let's put on our gold leaf. *M O R E E P I C M U S I C* Ooh look at that. Look how shiny that is Look how awesome this is. Now, This is a mirror polished Japanese gold foil ball. This is awesome! Okay. So first let's see what happens when I put my gold foil ball in the vacuum chamber and then we'll test dropping the gold leaf by itself. Okay, Japanese gold foil ball in the vacuum chamber (B R I E F C O U N T D O W N) *I N S E R T V A C U U M N O I S E H E R E* Okay, we're down to half an atmosphere. *M O R E V A C U U M N O I S E* Okay, we're down to full vacuum now. *L A U G H E S* And it doesn't look like anything has happened to it. And really that should come at no surprise to you. So even though there may be small little pockets of air in there, the maximum pressure that they can give off is around 14 pounds per square inch. And that's not enough at all to bend the metal to release the pressure. And so basically even though there may be tiny little air bubbles in there, they're under so much force from the foil being compressed on it, that it's not able to expand at all. Even though it's in a vacuum, but now let's look at something even cooler. Let's drop a little piece of that very thin foil and see what it looks like. This is a rendition of the experiment that they did on the moon when they dropped a feather and a hammer and they hit the ground at the same time Okay. We are at full vacuum as low as my vacuum chamber can get So let's go ahead and drop the foil and see if it just drops like a rock or a still floats down Let's check it out. Okay. I have my gold foil at top here connected with the magnet *E P I C E X P E R I M E N T T I M E* *S H O C K I N G R E S U L T* *C A N W E P L A Y T H A T B A C K* *W O W* Okay, now, let's see what happens when we let the air in. This is very thin foil so I don't know if it'll hold together well. *E P I C C O U N T D O W N* *S U P R I S E D N O I S E S* Guys this is epic This became gold dust tHaT'S aWesOMe That was wAy cOoL K , I need to try that again with more foil Okay, let's get down to full vacuum. *M O R E E P I C C O U N T D O W N* *I N S E R T V A C U U M N O I S E H E R E* Okay, we're now at a complete vacuum in there as low as I can get with my pump *E P I C S L O W M O T I O N* *I N S E R T D U S T S E T T L I N G N O I S E* Okay, that is one of the coolest things I've ever done in my vacuum chamber. *K I N D A L A U G H E S* That is so cool. Made it turn into golden snow (wow he's so rich that he can shred gold and here I am can't even buy a big mac). That was so cool. So the gold foil that I worked with in this video was actually not real gold (oh nvm about him being rich then) But it was actually an alloy of copper and zinc, but when you combine those in just the right way, It shines almost like it's pure gold. *S T E R E O T Y P I C A L O U T R O S T U F F
