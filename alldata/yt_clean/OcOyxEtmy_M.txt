Hello, how are you doing? Today we will be pranking Shfa! I haven't pranked her in a while, so I wanted to prank her today by telling her I sold her laptop. Look at her laptop. Shfa loves something called a laptop. She spends 24 hours per day using it. She loves gaming. Right after she finishes her studies, comes to the laptop. Okay! I will tell her that I sold her laptop with only 500 dirhams. Oh my god, God forgive me! Now Shfa is not home, she went outside. Let's start the prank quick, before she comes back. Stop stop stop! Before we start don't forget to like, share and subscribe. Let's get started with the prank. First thing first, I will hide the chair. And then the most important is the laptop. I will hide it somewhere secretive outside home. The headphones and the controller too. And now the screen, oh it's so heavy! I hid all the laptop, the table is the only thing left. We'll wait for Shfa to come home. Then we prank her. God help me through this, I am really scared! Oh the bell is ringing, it must be her. Let's open up. Okay okay. Shfa! How was it? Did you have fun? Yes. You sure? Yes I am. Come come, I have a surprise for you in the room. What is it? Come come. I am so excited for the surprise. Shfa hold on. Let's me go inside first then I let you in. Okay? Okay! One minute Shfa okay? Okay! Don't look don't. One Two Three. Shfa come in. Enter! Come! Where is my laptop? What? Where is it gone? What are you talking about? The laptop! I sold it. Swear!! I sold it, because you are all the time using it. You don't focus on your studies. You bothered me. I bought it right?! So I sold it. The laptop is new, we bought it week ago. Why did you sell it? Enough, you pissed me off. Whenever I ask you to sleep you keep playing. Isn't it true? What Shfa? I want it back, please. No I sold it out this morning. The man came and took it. Guess how much I sold it? How much? Sold it with 500. 500 dirhams only. Why 500? You sold it so cheap, you should have sold it with 5k. Enough, I sold it with 500 and the person already took it. Because you pissed me off. Whenever I ask you to sleep you never do, right? You stay on it. Go to study.. you keep using it. All day long using it. What? There is something left. What is it? You have got the table. What do I do with it? Study on it. How am I supposed to study on it. I already have my desk. Okay okay transform it to the iPad. Use the iPad in here. And the desk there. Why haven't you asked me before selling it. I am the one who brought it in the first place. You were supposed to tell me, why would you sell it. There was the laptop in her. Okay okay I am sorry. Why, why would you do this to me. You use it 24h. All the exams and stuff but you still use it. That's unfair, all the money I payed for it is all gone. It's not my business, you pissed me off. Oh no! I wish i didn't go outside. Shfa, it's for your own good. You use it all the time. Shfa!! No no no. You are not studying at all. You are not working hard at all. All the time on the laptop Shfa! What! Bring it back. Shfa I am truly sorry. I am going to tell mom. Oh no Shfa don't tell mom. Don't! She got really mad. She's going to tell mom, let's follow her. Shfa! Shfa!! Shfa? Don't talk to me. Mom!! Did you know that she sold my laptop? Why? I don't know and with only 500. 500? Yeah, she sold everything. Even the keyboard. She sold everything with 500. And it's worth 5k. Why did you sell her laptop. Mom she is using it 24h a day. She pissed me off. So I decided to sell it.

Seriously, did she really sell it with 500? Yes I sold it with 500, do you want to know why? So I can get rid of it quickly. She doesn't study or do anything. Just laptop, laptop laptop all the time. She deserves. Shfa! Why did you sell it without my permission? Shfa! Because I was the one who bought it. But it became mine, why would you sell it? I am sorry I am sorry, I apologize. But I told you I can't get it back. I already gave it to the man, I cannot get it back. Oh God. Shfa! Shfa! I swear my heart hurt, I will tell her that it's a prank. Quick quick.
