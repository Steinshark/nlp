00:00:00:00 - 00:00:13:20 You don't need to design so many variants to your prototypes. Today I will show you how to create a dropdown feature. Believe me, it will save you a lot of time. 00:00:13:20 - 00:00:43:07 Okay, So the first thing we need to do is we will reach here on the right hand side, And here we have now the create variable button Our boolean for our case, we will start with our fruits and it will be the name of the 00:00:43:11 - 00:01:29:28 Then we create another variable for string. So fruit two and two will be banana and another more fit for that can be strawberry. Okay, perfect. So now we have the variables for our item Now we can set also four colors, so we will 00:01:29:31 - 00:02:18:03 Now another one for the funds. So funds can be black and just another one It can be some purplish gray, something like Okay. And now just another one variable that can So when we have the dropdown collapse, we But then when we select our fruit in our least, our selection. 00:02:18:03 - 00:02:46:39 So it will be here option and we can call I think it's better like this. Okay, perfect. So now we have all our variables and what fruit one and four, we can select all of that, create a new group with the selection so we 00:02:46:43 - 00:03:14:40 Then we go again to our old variables and So we can click here and call these colors Okay, I can call it like that. All right, perfect. So now we have support variables, we have So we simplify a lot. 00:03:14:43 - 00:03:53:24 Our work in case that we need to weigh this And next step, let's create the components So we will start to select the text layer That will be our item from the list. So it shift A to apply utterly out and we radius to ten, and now I can align it to left 00:03:53:28 - 00:04:25:27 All right, perfect note. We will set the variable because we want the Let me just increase here a little bit because a variant that we will call over and change right, perfect. And we could call this, but then the list. Okay, Now next step is to create our lists, 00:04:25:27 - 00:05:06:25 I'm hitting option key and click to drag just So same process. And now I will select everything. Shift eight to apply auto layout and make it list. Perfect. All right. So I don't want this transparent corners here. So what I can do is to hit here field, set corners rounded. 00:05:06:29 - 00:05:30:45 So I will hit ten for the corner radius. Now we have our list, but as you can see, So what we need to do now is apply our local What I'm going to do is to double click here And as you can see now, we have here this 00:05:30:45 - 00:06:18:03 And if I click it, I can link to it one which And as you can see, it directly updated. So now the same for the second one, I will and the last one which is strawberry. And for example, if at any time you use, you Desert Island every two anymore and I want go here to local variables and instead of and it will directly edit okay, I will go 00:06:18:06 - 00:06:48:45 And right now we have the button and we have So what we need to do now is to create the So I will type here and you texts and let's to apply the outer layouts and I can already to primary. 00:06:49:02 - 00:07:14:25 Also, I want the rate current radius to ten these can be expandable or collapsible. So I will use the pen tool to quickly draw of the frame, as you can see, because we have 00:07:14:28 - 00:07:56:00 And just let me check the width 140. So this needs to be also 140 perfect. And I will set the minimum width, which is with 140. So that if I select Apple which has less characters at least 140. Okay, now I will need to create the second variant called Expandable Expanded. 00:07:56:04 - 00:08:36:45 Exactly. And this one will be collapsed. Okay. And also here in the Expendable, I can switch collapse it. And the same we then here for our first place So select the text and click here, apply variable So now I have here select fruit and the same 00:08:37:02 - 00:09:08:39 Okay, perfect. All right. So right now I have this aligning it to center the left and just let me shake also here. Yeah. Because our list, it's already aligned left. Okay, so everything needs to be consistent. And now here in my collapsed, I can select and copy and paste it my list inside of it. 00:09:08:39 - 00:09:35:38 Click. Just let me increase the size of the frame And if you see if you notice, the fruit list But we don't want we want that in below the So if we go here on top right and click here Now they are split it and you can click hold 00:09:35:40 - 00:10:00:10 Just one thing. If you go by this way and by clicking and look into our layers. Pino On the left side, if you go to far from, out of the frame. Okay, so I will apply Grand Z and you will component. 00:10:00:10 - 00:10:25:13 So if that happens, when you are doing this If you are going to fire from from this dropped is if you pasted right here you can use the it in simple steps just like this. Okay. And I can rename these to drop dropdown. 00:10:25:17 - 00:10:57:15 Okay. So now let's go to the fun part, which is So we need to link all the things and apply So let's start here. We will select here on top prototype to start And now you can click here in this plus icon that if I hover it, I want to change this 00:10:57:15 - 00:11:28:46 The status of hover. Perfect. And now if we do the mouse over here in our purple color. And here what we want is that when I click to the expanders and dropdown and the same So if I click here I want to collapse my dropdown. 00:11:29:03 - 00:11:57:16 Now the fun part is that okay, if I select replaced. So here, so instead of saying Select fruits So we will double click here to select that that says that when I'm on click, I want to 00:11:57:21 - 00:12:30:00 Okay, Select fruit to be replaced by Apple. And then I also, if I click if I wanted to So I want to hide this and select here the Okay. So before doing all all, all the rest, let's so we can tested and hit the playground heads. 00:12:30:04 - 00:13:07:07 Go ahead here and switch to design type and And we can go here and drag the component And now let's try the prototype. Okay, So I will click on Select Fruit and Now we can navigate with them and if I click 00:13:07:07 - 00:13:54:11 Closed already the dropdown and I have no So of course if I click here it nothing will So I will do again for the rest of the item So let's go here into banana and as the interaction two for two and I also changed the overlay on click set to variable option two for three 00:13:54:14 - 00:14:27:14 And lastly, as a new interaction here on a and change to collapse. Okay. And let's test it again. All right, So if I click here to open the switch, then I can click again. Now it's banana. The same for orange and the same for Strawberry. 00:14:27:17 - 00:15:01:15 So now our dropdown it's it's then we can So for example, regarding the design, I want I went to change the colors. So for example, something like this and I this. Okay? And instead of 100%, I want to be 20. 00:15:01:15 - 00:15:32:10 Okay, then I will copy this effect and apply So now let's test it again to see how it looks. And there you go. Pretty awesome, right? And that's it. There's our rocking dropdown and working. Very cool.
