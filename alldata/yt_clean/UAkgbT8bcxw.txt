Let's quickly Essentially, it started for the Germany had been pushed out of It needed access to capital markets, So, it proposed that Western countries &quot;share&quot; these resources, which led to World War I -- a war that Germany disastrously lost. which even those imposing them the Versailles-Washington system, for generations of Germans to repay, Germany was left with demilitarized zones, and navy, and so on, and so forth. two major empires collapsed: the Austro-Hungarian Empire and, This led to the creation of several new states: Poland, Hungary became independent following the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, and new countries emerged in the Balkans. The map the Treaty of Versailles morally, politically, and economically. Germany yearned for revenge. perfectly understood these feelings and began building a new, militarized state and becoming the dominant power in Western Obviously, Hitler was opposed by the French and the British -- Germany's two but this is where things get complicated. One key question is: Britain, France, and America unite after the annexation of Austria or even after after the invasion of Poland? Why didn't the Allies unite to strangle there were no real alliances. viewed Stalin's Soviet Union as much They were afraid of it, and they even planned The Soviet Union, however, didn't stay on the sidelines. a non-aggression agreement with Hitler, it began imperial lands, the former territories in future episodes. Meanwhile, the U.S. they were focused on an impending conflict So, there were no true allies at that time. though they abandoned Czechoslovakia, as I explained in our episode Yet they did guarantee an alliance with Poland. with Hitler was also very ambiguous. had been an ally of Hitler. When Czechoslovakia the Teschen region and felt pretty confident. It all started with what was called at how this worked: Prussia was on one side, with the Polish Corridor and the Free City of Danzig German territory in two. There were how to handle payments for this transit, and In the end, the Germans approached the Poles and said, &quot;Listen, give us this corridor so we can reunite, connect our territories. they continued throughout 1939, to give the Poles Soviet Ukrainian lands, a war with Stalin. They proposed, "Support us, from sea to sea -- from the Baltic Just give us the Polish Corridor&quot;. While they weren't entirely opposed the Soviet Union. Poland and Germany they had a non-aggression treaty, They weren't at all opposed to the idea didn't want to give up the Polish Corridor. that war was inevitable -- planning meetings were held All that was needed was a pretext for war. were violating the border and instigating They insisted they were not carrying out the Polish army was much weaker, so Poland But a pretext was necessary, and thus the plan called &quot;Operation Himmler&quot; was conceived. Sports fans know that the legendary also played hockey. He won trophies in both sports, and he was even invited to join the Soviet to focus on football.

What choice do we have?&quot; can't just not defend its own lands." codenamed "Canned Goods." Reinhard Heydrich, "Let's make it look like this: we have town of Gleiwitz. Let's have the Poles seize it. We'll dress up SS officers in Polish uniforms, attack our own radio station, fire shots at the walls, and broadcast a message in Polish saying something like, 'We, Greater Poland, are launching an invasion of Germany the Nazi regime's tyranny,' and so on. ethnic Germans born in Poland to broadcast this message on the air." Obviously, they didn't want to kill their own people, They took concentration camp prisoners already dressed some in Polish uniforms and staged the scene: a Polish squad had supposedly invaded, a firefight the radio station. Here are the Polish bodies, shock, horror, how terrible, what a tragedy! comes from the leader of this operation, who was responsible for carrying it out. He was The signal was a phone call with So, on August 31st, he was in the hotel, and immediately began the operation The bodies were laid out, the and a broadcast was aired, claiming Hitler used this to alarm the Western public, saying, "Look, this is awful! We must defend our borders." Hitler didn't speak of war; he talked about a "Polish campaign," the safety of Germany's borders. What was Hitler's plan? To quickly defeat Poland. Germany believed that neither Britain just as they had abandoned Czechoslovakia. to sit down at the negotiating table and say, let's work things out now, We've taken the Polish Corridor, a few other things, Of course, Hitler had no intention as a large staging ground It was a vast territory with industry, for expanding Germany's "living space" Hitler's main idea was that Germany needed to expand, needed more land for pastures, agriculture, to become the dominant power in Europe. for war with France on the continent. If France them. If not, they'd be dealt with later. As for The Soviet Union was not a threat at the time, thanks to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, After World War I, Germany found It had to rebuild its army, and navy, too, which was limited by the Versailles Germany needed somewhere to train but this couldn't be done within Germany a close eye on them. This led to the development and Germany. The Soviet Union received technology in tank and aviation facilities in the Soviet Union. In return, the Soviets supplied Germany everything they needed. It was A month before the war, There are a few key interpretations of this pact. The first is that Stalin and Hitler divided Europe between themselves, with take over Poland, Czechoslovakia, In reality, we can't know for sure this is just my interpretation. wanted to reclaim the lands that were once that the Red Army was being built up, equipped with new weapons, so Stalin definitely had something in mind. that a war with Hitler was inevitable. was a way to buy time and delay Stalin managed to delay the war by two years. to implement some reforms, carry out mobilization, as we'll see in 1941, this process Another important point: before there were negotiations in March and Stalin had proposed forming to ensure cooperative defense and economic ties. Both Britain and France -- this is why I mentioned they saw Stalin as just as much of an enemy -- essentially pushed Stalin towards Stalin realized that war was coming to Europe, and he wanted the Soviet Union Let Germany, France, and Britain wear themselves its foreign policy goals. Perhaps, the Soviet Union polagaiu, chto vot takoi plius-minus, vot I believe Stalin had these thoughts in mind was seeking agreements with both Britain On the other hand, talks with Hitler moved everything was signed because Hitler to agree to anything Stalin asked for. they would secure themselves from the Polish campaign, a possible and potentially against Britain and France. Thus, Hitler entered the war the code phrase &quot;Grandma has died&quot; and German troops began moving into Poland. At 4:45 a.m., shots were fired A week before this, the outdated had arrived on a friendly visit and immediately On that same day, the first air duel shot down the first Polish fighter.

This was essentially The Soviet Union started deploying troops, I said the war had begun but there was an attempt to prevent it. proposed a peace conference with the participation However, Italy was insignificant in Europe responded by saying, &quot;Sure, let's hold withdraw all their troops from Czechoslovakia will we negotiate&quot;. Naturally, Hitler refused and France declared war on Germany. Following Australia, New Zealand, India, and South Canada would follow suit a bit later. Spaniards generally have a negative he started a civil war that plunged Spain into bloodshed, and the Basque regions of their independence, However, Spaniards are grateful to Franco to keep Spain out of World War II. Spain was the first country &quot;We will not participate, we are on our banking system is operational, Business as usual&quot;. From the very beginning By September 5th, the Polish government had been evacuated from Warsaw to Lublin. and the Third Army (under Kuchler) had already encircled one of Poland's armies, and Polish forces were beginning to surrender. Now, let's shift to another part of the world. I would have started with something while Europe was just beginning on Poland, China had already been engaged for some time. Japan had launched a full-scale war in China and was embroiled in conflict there, which the Americans, British, and French insisted on establishing a puppet its economic interests, Additionally, Japan was periodically invading Soviet forces. For instance, of Japanese troops attempted to capture 350 men. So, Japan was also in a state with the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, back The Soviet Union was conducting a covert already beginning. In Germany, was introduced: the death penalty for actions This applied to any acts of sabotage, related to defense or military industries -- so, a real death penalty for all that. declared war on September 3rd, but you're what were the French and British doing during this were engaged in what would later be called fulfilling its alliance obligations and captured 12 German towns. It seemed at Germany's rear, especially with the British joining for Germany. But the war didn't unfold that way. known as the &quot;Siegfried Line&quot;, a German building fortified lines was a popular strategy. permanent gun emplacements, with underground arsenals, and above-ground batteries. They also had and anti-tank obstacles. Europe had there was the &quot;Maginot Line&quot;, built invasion. In Germany's Rhine Valley, In Finland, a similar line on the Karelian and Belgium had its own fortified line from a possible German attack. in the trench warfare tactics of World War I -- and engaging in a prolonged, stationary war, similar One of the key reasons for France's eventual which expected a slow, static, and immobile war. But the Germans, with their tank divisions and surprise attacks, So, while France initially sent its troops everything soon came to a standstill. You might be surprised, but the war remained would sit there. There would be occasional and sometimes the French would bomb the Ruhr. France adopted the &quot;aggressive defense&quot; strategy. were guaranteeing that the Germans wouldn't attack and it would drag on for a year. On September 9, launched a major battle against the German General Johannes Blaskowitz. things spiraled into disaster: the Germans reached the Polish army, surrounded near Radom, What did the French do at this point, having received news from Poland? to halt their advance due to the A rather paradoxical decision. In fact, They realized they couldn't take it in one swift had reached the city with infantry divisions, laying advanced towards Lwow. This brings us the Germans had been flirting with Ukrainian knowing that there were significant national The Germans tried to use these agents to carry out sabotage and destabilize with the Soviet Union were still unclear. Once Hitler signed the pact with the Soviets, were quickly forgotten because All the promises made to them -- and granting Western Ukraine were instantly abandoned. So, the German which, back then, belonged to Poland. had broken through to Brest, and the Poles holding out for several days. However, and by September 14, the Germans In total, it took the German army just 14 days to decisively defeat Poland. between the Soviet Foreign Minister, Schulenburg. Molotov stated that, according to protect the interests of the and Western Ukraine and to reunite He said that the Soviet troops were ready needed to know when Warsaw would fall. a few more days, and after that, their forces into Poland. These meetings would continue -- not daily, discussing various matters between For Hitler, these talks were crucial, on Stalin's stance and future actions. This was one of the first meetings By September 15, the German army had advanced and Osowiec. If you remember the episode no heroic defense of the fortress, as it was now reached this frontline, and issued a twelve-hour ultimatum the city had to disarm, civilians had to The Germans warned that if the city The Poles rejected this ultimatum. On the 16th, of Germany joined forces, essentially the last significant military resource realizing the situation was hopeless, appealed being to escape to Romanian territory and from there, essentially saying, &quot;Go ahead, escape if you must&quot;. and the Poles requested that civilians &quot;We gave you 12 hours, and you didn't comply. on September 17, the Soviet the Polish border. Molotov spoke on the radio, declaring that the Polish state had collapsed working class and peasants under the control of capitalists and landowners, of Belarus and Western Ukraine Soviet troops entered Western Ukraine another important event took place -- between the Soviet Union and Japan. about Pearl Harbor. If you haven't seen it, which front to focus on after China: whether This truce with the Soviet Union, of a diplomatic maneuver because Japan They didn't have enough tanks and didn't the vast expanses of Russian territory. On September 18, the Soviet army entered the capital of Lithuania. Back then, entered it. Around this time, near the city of Brest-Litovsk.

It's interesting, or our historical series, how different countries In Germany, they rationed bread, meat, bacon, ham, butter, and meat. Notice that bacon and ham were not part of the German rations. The French, entrenched in the Rhineland, met with the German military attache diplomatic agreements regarding when the German and Western Belarus, allowing a civilian uprising erupted in Warsaw. and civilians launched a rebellion, which was quickly crushed. The Soviet Union and Germany discussed the demarcation line between the two countries. With Poland now shared a common border. What was the Western press saying? can easily be accused of they were engaged in propaganda, and British, and French newspapers as well. Instead, I'll quote from the Daily Worker, that the Red Army, as it entered was enthusiastically welcomed by the local of these meetings. This is what the Americans of the German and Soviet armies took place marched in front of their commanders, had reached an agreement and would now marched together in a joint display, On September 23, Germany's high command officially announced that the Polish campaign gave his first wartime speech on September 1, he wore a military uniform. From this point on, important speeches in military attire, a simple corporal who had seen the trench war This narrative of Hitler as a &quot;common soldier&quot; by German propaganda.

The British Parliament over the number of troops to be sent, While those plans were being finalized, Poland the British began their troop transfer in serious combat.

With the issue Stalin's government turned its attention to other matters of concern -- namely, Diplomatic maneuvers with Molotov met with representatives a trade agreement. According to the Estonians, before Molotov got to the real point: to the substance of the matter. We need that the war in Europe will escalate, the Soviet Union. We may have a peace treaty tomorrow. Meanwhile, Britain and France Baltic territories to be used as staging grounds for enemy forces attacking Soviet soil&quot;. Molotov then directly stated that the Soviets along with a limited contingent On September 25, the Germans began brutal and senseless bombing. The goal was intimidation rather than military strategy -- a message to the Polish and defy us? We'll bomb you into On the same day, Hitler signed Despite the alliance with the Soviet Union and the fact that the Baltics were part of the Soviet for the invasion and annexation of Lithuania. to expand, with cards now required for the the Bulgarian press reported that Ukrainians and Belarusians were extremely enthusiastic these lands would become part of the Soviet Union. agreements with Molotov in Moscow, between Estonia and the Soviet Union, of a Soviet military base with a limited On September 26, German forces launched flew to Moscow to propose a new not about demarcation lines, but Let's take a brief detour to France. The main enemy was Germany, and the French in the Rhineland. But what was happening inside France? was completely banned. the French, and to a lesser extent the British, viewed the communist threat at the time. It's important to note that leftist ideas, in post-World War I Europe. Movements like the Comintern which were predominantly leftist, and social justice. These ideas were extremely that the French, British, and Germans feared them. of the intellectual elite, who, Thus, France acted within the scope of prevailing Western policies By September 28, Warsaw had fallen. and from that moment on, Poland, as a state, wouldn't be discussed again until 1945. documents for the treaty with Estonia. &quot;You were correct to sign -- very foresighted. By the end of September, Hitler had accomplished From September 29 into early October, German troops, no longer needed in Poland, During this period, United Press, coined the term &quot;Phoney War&quot;. They reported: is happening. The French are sitting there are even some women around, Meanwhile, trains full of German troops pass no one is shooting at them -- nothing at This was the first time the term &quot;Phoney War&quot; negotiations on their new border agreement, the &quot;Treaty of Friendship and Borders&quot;. government-in-exile was being formed. though eventually, London would become the sole hub. governments-in-exile. After along with other exiled governments would relocate to London, made up from governments-in-exile. Following the French took further steps This move drew criticism from their allies, that such actions violated and political choice. But the French ignored against communism. Meanwhile, on the other side the capital of Sichuan Province, marking the start German forces, now free from fighting in Poland, to the Western Front. The French, seeing and withdrew their troops behind the Maginot Line. and laughed at the Germans, confident that It was a state-of-the art, ultra-modern so the French felt completely secure and at ease.

This topic is not the focus of our discussion, but what's interesting is the inconsistency in Britain's policy On one hand, they proposed establishing yet later, the British would block Romanians to be one of the safest routes for would claim there was no capacity effectively cutting off for Jews targeted by the Nazi genocide. right now, it's the Balfour Plan. On October 5, In his speech, he declared that the Reich the &quot;Polish military beast&quot; that other appropriate remarks. It was clear and turned into the General Government. from the next Baltic state, Lithuania, and offered them a deal similar &quot;We sign a trade agreement, and at the same time, with a limited contingent of 25,000 troops&quot;. proposal to Finland, though they didn't expect I wasn't too familiar with but it's important to note that after the Russian Finland gained its independence. In 1918, the First Karelian War broke out, It was during this time that vowing to drive out the Leninist hooligans, This helped fuel the formation of a &quot;Greater Finland&quot;, which included While today this might seem like an odd serious concepts, much like the idea National governments were seriously Finland exhibited extremely anti-Soviet despite Finland's later post-WWII friendly relations with the Soviet Union. But before the war, everything was different, and the Finnish were strongly opposed to the Soviet Union. secret diplomatic messages to London and Paris, suggesting the possibility of peace talks: it's no longer an issue. Can we start negotiating?&quot; The French and British rejected this. Meanwhile, To give you an idea of the scale, one section of the battle saw 90,000 Japanese troops showing just how brutal and bloody from the British and French, claiming that peace had finally particularly in Eastern Europe, and that were fully aligned in maintaining this peace. The Germans waited another day, But the British and the French don't change their mind. officially liquidating Poland. Poland was no more -- it became the General Government, appointed as the first governor. Frank creating Jewish ghettos and Despite his infamy, this is the historical fact: and the General Government was in place. that the Soviet Union was negotiating with and under the influence of France and Britain, the Germans were concerned about a possible They received intelligence on these talks, approached Molotov to ask, &quot;What The Soviet Foreign Ministry responded by saying, of our German partners. We're free to talk and we're not plotting against you&quot;. Despite this, the Soviet Union was in talks with Turkey. troops in Estonia and would soon do the same that the Soviets might be up to something. On October 9, Hitler took another step forward by signing Directive &quot;Gelb&quot;, which outlined the plan to invade the territory of France and defeat the French forces, or rather, the Franco-British forces. Planning for On October 10, a terrible milestone was reached: the establishment of the Jewish ghetto in Lublin. Jews from all over Poland began Jews from Pomerania, Silesia, and Austria in Moscow, negotiations between The Soviets wanted to put their base in Lithuania, and they offered the Lithuanians Vilnius, Lithuania agreed to the proposal, Up until this point, Vilnius had not Kaunas had held that role -- Vilna, which belonged to Poland, was handed the deployment of a limited Soviet military occurred that would change the course of history: a group of scientists, led by Albert Einstein, was working on developing an atomic bomb. was somewhat restrained, as few truly Nonetheless, the U.S. began to prepare Stalin was informed about this, needed its own atomic project. But the most critical on the path to building the bomb, although, thank God, the Germans never The Germans didn't manage to obtain Hans Frank became the first governor the mass deportations of Jews Jews from Czechoslovakia, Austria, were getting forcibly relocated to ghettos, Negotiations also began between the Soviet Union on the strategic location of Leningrad. Stalin was to a potential enemy army and requested that the This was the main demand, though there were also other related issues that Finland cede the Hanko Peninsula in the Gulf of Finland, which and were crucial strategic points. a larger area in Karelia, which was less but twice the size of the territory Finland rejected the offer. The negotiations that no mutual concessions On October 14, the British realized that their sense of invulnerability from World War I the main base of the British fleet, was heavily making it almost impossible However, the German submarine U-47 boldly Royal Oak, killing 800 men. The operation the submarine simply sailed into launched its torpedoes, then dove The crew of the Royal Oak initially thought they anti-aircraft fire and searchlights to scan the sky, The British were stunned that such The British press reported that German planes and The Times downplayed the incident, from World War I had been one of the leading ships of In mid-October, the Soviet Embassy from Molotov. It read: &quot;Dear comrades, in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, and leftist movements holding demonstrations, expressing support for the Soviet Union, to become part of the Soviet Union. We must Anything that could be interpreted in the internal politics of Latvia, Lithuania, no receptions of Latvian delegations -- If they contact you, turn We do not want to interfere, nor do we wish to infringe upon the sovereignty to establish military bases there, and that's all&quot;. had always aimed to annex the Baltic states. the fact remains that the Baltics were eventually annexed. However, at this initial stage, Molotov was issuing repeated instructions, even into 1940, insisting that embassies cease any contact with these friendly organizations, to ensure that no one could of meddling in their internal affairs. and the Wehrmacht emerged in Germany after the Polish campaign. to Hitler, insisting that many SS officers in torture, violence, and looting. The Wehrmacht while they viewed the SS as thugs Hitler came to the defense of the SS. On October 17, and personnel from military courts. by their own internal tribunals. This decision caused a significant conflict, the army's discipline and tarnishing However, Hitler refused to listen as his personal guard and was determined that was clear to the Germans Meanwhile, plans for Poland were the diaries of General Halder that the primary targets in Poland were the elites -- and clergy -- who were to be The goal was to turn Poland into a region with a low standard of living, where slave labor would be exported to Germany and to support its agriculture Essentially, Poland was to become This plan would eventually be laid out in full as October 18, Halder recorded in his diary Here is a direct quote from Halder: on the Polish problem. We have Safeguards against proposed actions a staging ground for future actions by German troops. but must not be ruled according to German standards. to become the ruling class. with cheap slave labor. All undesirable from German territories&quot;. It's clear that Halder was summarizing the key points that Hitler presented during the meeting. This story is important for two reasons. First, it gives us a glimpse into what the Germans were Second, the date -- October 18, 1939 -- is significant. On this day, Hitler held a meeting. Why is this date important? There is a historical myth that claims Hitler and Stalin secretly two armored trains arrived -- The city of Lwow was supposedly cordoned off by Soviet and German troops for this secret meeting. But this claim doesn't hold up. By then, German troops had already left Lwow. It seems to have originated from a memo written by The memo stated that, according to their But why would they meet in secret when through Molotov in Moscow? There is solid evidence to debunk it. and on that day, he was meeting with Molotov and Zhdanov. As for Hitler, he was so neither of them could have been in Lwow. On October 19, German troops began preparations for Operation &quot;Gelb&quot;, Hitler confirmed the plan and declared Meanwhile, in Turkey, important negotiations and Turkey. of this agreement, the British discussed Why Baku? By this point, Britain Germany's sea ports to prevent them from receiving food and materials. In response, sinking Allied transport ships. But Germany had an agreement with oil and wheat via railways. were considering bombing Baku, launching attacks from air force bases to cut off Germany's access to Soviet oil. the Soviet oil infrastructure, but, so Moscow learned about these plans. yet another message to the Soviet embassies as he had been doing weekly, that they in those countries. On October 19, he sent another On that same day in the United States, the first meeting of the Uranium Committee, on developing an American atomic weapon. that Hitler had approved was fiercely Keitel, in particular, was strongly There was an inspection of the troops, that the army was not ready for war. personally attended the inspection, and he realized would fall behind others, logistics would and the marching columns would be split apart. But Hitler dismissed their concerns, saying, &quot;This In the end, Poland was defeated in just would attack France in early November. which prevented air operations, the execution Ultimately, it would not be launched until May 1940. Despite these delays, tensions within the German command began to take shape -- the same conspiracy about Operation &quot;Valkyrie&quot;. Many German generals to be killed, as they feared Despite their rapid victory in Poland, much like World War I had in 1918, They felt unprepared for that conflict. at the time. In November, a second round and the Soviet Union took place in Moscow. the Soviets wanted to move the border 40-70 km and double the size of what was requested. the Soviet military council presented to destroy the Finnish land army and navy.
