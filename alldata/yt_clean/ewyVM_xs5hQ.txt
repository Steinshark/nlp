Hey, are you buying stuff? Stop wasting our time. Get out if you can't afford it. I just forgot my wallet. My grandson's coming over. How dare you come without money? get outta here! Out! Ouch! What are you doing? Ma'am, are you okay? Ah. Are you okay? I'm fine. Thank you. Hey, is that how you treat an old lady? Our cake each costs two thousand dollars. Not people like you can afford. Get lost. Two thousand dollars? What made it so expensive? I just sell stuff on the street. I can't afford their cakes. If you are hungry, you can have this. If only the girl had been my granddaughter-in-law. Thank you. Girl, what's your name? Add me on WhatsApp. Sure, haha. I'm Shelly Jones. Ok. I'm running late and gotta set up my stall. Enjoy the snack. I'm off now. Okay. Jaden Lewis, Loyo Group CEO Good afternoon, Mrs. Lewis. Grandma, what are you doing here? Jaden, what took you so long? My granddaughter-in-law has left. Grandma, I'm not even married. What are you talking about? The one I just found you. Let's go. I'm taking you to her now. Come. Shelly, where's your stall? I wanna get some clothes. Grandma, stop messing around. Who would care about an old lady who can't afford cakes? I'm at Central Square. Come by, I'll pick something nice for you. Your folks owe me twenty thousand dollars. If you don't pay up, I'll go dig up their graves! Can you give me a few more days? Mom and Dad got into bad stocks. I sold our house in central district. to pay for their debts. Where can I get that much now? Oh, here you are. I designed all of these. Pick anything you like. It's on the house. Shelly, these are beautiful. And you're selling them here. What a waste. Not at all. All gold glitters no matter where. Great optimism, I like that! This is my grandson, Jaden Lewis. Twenty-eight years old. If you like him, he's all yours. Sorry, but I'm not looking to get married yet. Neither am I. Seven hundred million dollars and five villas in the central area. I can give you anything you want. Really? No. My grandma grew up poor. She fears being looked down on, bluffing about wealth all the time. I'm just an average salaryman. I make two thousand dollars a month without house or car. Shelly, don't listen to him. I'm rich. How much do you want? I can give you. Uhm, well, I need twenty thousand dollars. Is that too much? Ten thousand dollars, then. I'll take care of the rest. Showing her true colors. Hahaha. You two are getting your marriage certificates tomorrow. Can't believe I'm calling a stranger I just met my husband. This is just temporary. I'll show Grandma her true colors. Certificates! I'll keep them safe for you. So you can't secretly divorce. Grandma, my photo's ugly. I'll keep it myself. Sorry. What's there to be sorry? You're married. He's all yours now. You're right. Jaden, looks like you like Shelly a lot. I'm having coffee with some friends. You two get to know each other. Don't get it wrong. Just now, it was just an act to please Grandma. I don't want her to have doubts. Oh, sure, I get it. By the way, this is my card. There's not much in it. But I'll get a job soon, and I'll have a fixed salary then. Money will be sent to every month. I'll pay twenty thousand dollars back in installments. Did I get it wrong? Maybe, she's not a gold digger, after all. Hmph, she may just be thinking ahead. No need. Keep it. Okay. What are you doing here? Is that your car? Of course not. I just wanna get a photo. Can you? Would the owner allow it? Sure, go ahead. I want one, too! We got our photo. Let's go now. Where to? I'll give you a ride. Not on your way. You don't know where I'm going. How are you sure of that? Get me to the subway stop, then. Sure! Okay, hop on. Okay. Hold on. Bye-bye! Mr. Lewis, your morning schedule is a trip to the newly acquired Galactic Design. They're interviewing designer candidates today. Let's have a look, then. Got it. Isn't that Diana Gray from the artist Gray family? What's she doing here? Looks like I've zero chance now. Isn't this a boutique company? Why are there so many candidates? Let me tell you, it was acquired by Loyo Group. This is the first interview after the acquisition. I heard Mr. Lewis's coming. Many are here to steal a glance at him. It's said he's a hot young man with several billion dollars in assets, No.1 billionaire for three years. I heard he's a low-key person, who never accepts interviews. Only the higher-ups get to see him. Today's interview is a great chance to meet him. What's his name, then? You don't know? His name's. . . Quiet, please. Welcome to the interview. I'm the head interviewer today. We'll be judging your design skills in real time. Also, Loyo Group CEO will be joining us later. I hope to see your very best. Please come with me now. Get up. This table's mine. It's a shared dressing room. If you wanna use, be faster next time. Oh, look who it is. One of my school's needy students. Are you here to clean up trash? I'm here for the interview. What happened to their standards? Even you can get an interview here. Yes, they do have pretty low standards. -Pretty bad taste. -Seriously? My family consists of designers, and I'm just back from abroad. Bumpkin, what do you know? The judge will tell how much I know. Not you. Stop daydreaming. I'm telling you now. My uncle is a director at Loyo Group. This job is mine. The interview's just for show. You'd better give up now. I don't care who your uncle is. I'm not giving up. Mr. Lewis, We set up a livestream. You can watch it from here. Next, please welcome Shelly Jones and Diana Gray to the stage. What's going on? Why are their gowns exactly the same? I paid a lot to get the design of this piece. How can Shelly's look exactly the same? What's going on? Why are the two gowns exactly the same? Diana's uncle is a director at Loyo Group. You know what to do. We've concluded Shelly plagiarized. You have no proof. How can you say I plagiarized? Shelly, There's no job experience on your CV. Your only experience is selling clothes at a stall. Have you worn a gown before? You designed that? Don't make me laugh. Not only that, she's known for being broke at our school. She wore cheap clothes to class every day. Not twenty dollars worth of tags. There might even be patches on her underwear. I've never worn an evening gown. But I can design one. I posted this design online. Someone must've copied it. Who knows who posted it? You're saying it's your design. I can say it's mine. Right. How can an online piece hold up as proof? The Grays are all designers. No doubt Ms. Gray can design this piece. That's right. How could a broke girl like you come up with such a piece? Diana, you're saying it's your design. Where's your drawing, then? I didn't bring it. Didn't bring it? Any chance the piece is really not hers? We only asked for the final piece, not the original drawing. She didn't bring it. But I did. That's a complete design with meticulous details. Wow, it looks amazing. I can say that's the best piece we have today! Look at this. I was wondering where my drawing went. Turns out you stole it. Stop making up stuff here. It's my own design. Ms. Stone, she stole my design. I'm asking you to ban her from all design positions. She can't ban me! As Galactic Design's senior, head of Designers' Association, I can. This interview is livestreaming. Everyone watching now knows you're a plagiarizer. Think about it, who will hire you from now? If the industry's made up of people like you, I don't mind giving it up. Remember this. You didn't refuse me today. I refused your company. A company that can't even tell the designer from the plagiarizer is going down soon. Wait. Where are you going? You stole my design. Shouldn't you apologize? Right, apologize! Apologize! Apologize! Right, apologize! Apologize and get out! They're making no sense! Looks like I gotta tidy up this company. Tell them to stop the livestream. Yes, Sir. They who pissed off Mr. Lewis after the acquisition are in trouble. I didn't plagiarize, so I'm not apologizing. I must get her to apologize. That way, it'll stick to her. Don't think about leaving before you apologize. Stop her. Apologize! Apologize! Mr. Lewis is here. You're. . . Mr. Lewis! Not me. I'm Mr. Lewis. I thought I married a CEO. Luckily, I stopped in time. Sorry, Mr. Lewis. We ran into some trouble, but it's all settled now. We just need her to apologize. Jumping to a conclusion is how you settled it? What else is needed? The Grays are all designers, while Shelly's a broke girl. Don't their backgrounds say it all? Designer background. Then, Ms. Gray, please tell us your inspiration of the piece. Inspiration of the piece? I was inspired by medieval art. This piece looks more Renaissance than medieval art. Are you telling the truth? Mr. Lewis, Ms. Gray must be nervous and misspoke. You can ask Shelly. I'm sure she has no clue. I've no clue, says who? My inspiration came from Venus, the goddess, in the Birth of Venus. Venus, the goddess was born from a giant shell, a symbolic fusion of spirit and matter. Ms. Stone, do you have anything to say? Mr. Lewis, I'm a senior here, after all. You can't fire me just after the acquisition, can you? Jaden, How do you deal with this? Mr. Lewis, since you asked me, I'll be frank. Ms. Stone is to lose her annual bonus and forty percent of her salary. The plagiarizer is disqualified and blacklisted by Loyo Group. Shelly should get hired with an increase in salary. Heard that? Get lost now. Mr. Lewis! Mr. Lewis! Hey, who are you really? Why did you walk in front just now? I. . . I'm Mr. Lewis' bodyguard. I was clearing the way for him. That's right. With Jaden walking in front, I feel very safe. I see. Luckily, you came in time. Turns out you're a bodyguard. -Pretty average muscles. -Really? Mr. Lewis, I heard you are a billionaire. Don't forget your bodyguard! Follow Mr. Lewis. Work hard. By the way, the company holds welcome parties for all newcomers. Any restaurant you fancy? Are. . . you asking me? Right. Well, you know, I'm a pretty caring boss. Haha. So, any restaurant you like? Then, what about Golden Plate with famous cakes? Jaden, book the place. We're throwing the welcome party there. Bring your partner. I stood in for the CEO and helped him win his wife's heart. I'm a genius! Err, in that case, I. . . I'll bring Grandma! She wanted their cakes earlier. Now she can have some for free! Are you sure you're not bringing me? Why should I bring you? Your boss is gone. As his bodyguard, you should follow him. Quick! Don't get fired! Hurry, go! Hey! Grandma, you can have the cake you wanted. What a good girl you are. Haha. Shelly, you're the reason I got my salary reduced and my bonus gone. I'll teach you a lesson later. Shelly, why are you bringing her? Where's your husband? I was told to bring a partner, not my husband specifically. My husband's grandma can come with me. You are supposed to bring your husband. You didn't bring your husband. Is it because he's broke and would embarrass you? Hah. Shelly, so you're supposed to bring your husband? I'll call him now, ask him to come. Grandma. Jaden, come to Golden Plate. . . Grandma? Grandma? Get her location. Yes, Sir. Old hag, who are you trying to call? There is no place for your family gathering. Wanna bring your whole family? Have some shame! Grandma, are you okay? I'm fine, don't worry. My grandson's on his way. Your grandson? What's he coming for? To serve us? Enough. If anything happens to her, I'll make you pay. How dare you talk to me like that? Looks like you need a good lesson to learn who the leader is. Grab them! What are you doing? My grandson's coming. He'll make you pay! Here for a free meal, aren't you? I'll stuff it in your face. Grandma! Inhaler. I have the inhaler. Heard that? What are you doing? Give it back! Without it, she might die! Want it back? She gotta bow and beg me. Heard that? Beg me! No! Please! Let her go! Stop! Please let go of her! How far is it? Hurry. One minute. We'll be there soon. I can let her go. But you have to take her place. You beg me, then. I'll do it. Shelly, no! Shelly, no! Leave them alone! Mr. Lewis, why are you here? Take her over there. Leave the rest to me. Okay. How dare you do that to them? Mr. Lewis hasn't said anything. Why are you questioning me? Who are you to talk? How dare you say that? Have you any idea who you offended? Mr. Lewis, he's just a bodyguard. So what? He's my trusted man. Disrespect him? You disrespect me! Pack your stuff and get lost! Jaden, what do you think? I want a ban on her. None of Loyo Group's partners will hire her. Mr. Lewis, don't listen to him! Shut up! Drag her out! Mr. Lewis! Mr. Lewis! From now on, whoever is hard on my family will end up like her. You all heard that? Yes, Sir. We heard it. Sorry, I failed to protect her. Don't blame yourself. It's not your fault. Grandma, how are you feeling? Does it still hurt? I'm fine. You don't need to sit here. There are nurses around. How can we leave you? Grandma, why don't you move in with me? Your injuries are serious. You need to be taken care of. Okay. Let Jaden come with me, then. Can't let you take care of me all by yourself. We. . . move in with you? Yes. My place is a bit small, but I can sleep on the floor. It's convenient, though, I can cook for Grandma. No need. She was right. There are nurses here. How can the nurses compare to Shelly? Grandma, that's not what you said. Jaden, are you wanting Shelly for yourself and me out of the picture? No. How can you treat me so? Jaden, that's not what you think, right? No. Of course not. That's good. Let's pack and go home. Let's move to Shelly's place. Yes, ma'am. Why do you come without grandma? Isn't she here? She left first. I thought she came here. Grandma. Jaden, I'll be with my friends at the beachside nursing home. Take good care of Shelly. Grandma, you're not coming? Nah. You two spend time together. Jaden, I canceled your rent lease. Are you sleeping on the street? Great move she got me here. I'll expose myself if I leave now. Grandma, thanks for saving me money. Yeah, I did, as I should. Gotta go. I'm hanging up now. If you don't want me here, I can ask for Mr. Lewis a place. Can't keep asking him for favors. There's only one bedroom here. Since your job's harder, you can have it. I'll take the sofa. Oh right, I'll get you a drink. It's pretty cramped here, but she has the place all nice and tidy. We're married, after all. I shouldn't worry about that. I accepted his grandma's money, so I should be a good wife. Besides, he's pretty protective of me. But I'm not prepared. Whatever, I'll go with the flow. Oh, no! Is he taking a shower? The heater's broken. Will he get an electric shock? Stop! No! Sorry, the heater's broken, I forgot to tell you. Are you okay? I'm fine. But if you keep touching me, I'm not so sure. Sorry. There's no power anyway, I'll go sell some clothes. You should go to bed. You're out this late? I'll go with you. Okay. You made less than ten dollars. Do you think it's worth it? Of course! It covers my food for a week. If I work for a few more nights, we can have steaks on the weekend. I don't know if working overtime, if I need to work overtime, I won't be able to sell the clothes. Ah. Employees from Loyo Group get three times paid for overtime. Really? Loyo Group is the best company ever! And Mr. Lewis is the best boss! Thanks. I was praising Mr. Lewis. What's the thanks for? I can't get this thing up the slope. Jaden, get down for a bit. Who's that? Can't you see us? Look who it is. It's Shelly, the loser. You crashed my boyfriend's car. I can sell you both and still can't pay for the damage! Diana, you are shameless. You crashed into us. I should be asking you to pay, not the other way around. How much can that bike cost? My boyfriend's car is the newest BMW. Look at that scratch. Ten thousand dollars. Pay up. Ten thousand dollars? It's my first time meeting scam artists as bold as you two. Shelly, let's go. Wait! You're her husband? So? No wonder Mr. Lewis took her side during the interview. I thought she knew him. Turns out it's because of you. Birds of a feather indeed. A cheap loser and a broke bodyguard. What a pair! What's the problem with his job? Every profession deserves respect. Only a plagiarist like you gets none of that. You! Babe, she's insulting me. Don't worry, babe. I'm here. Leave her alone! Wow, your watch! It's a Patek Philippe limited edition. I heard it was auctioned for seven million dollars. He must've got it from some cheap store. Broke as you are, you've got some guts for waving it around. Looks just like the real deal. Stop acting rich, loser! My watch is fake. Is your shirt authentic, then? The authentic shirt has golden threads on the buttons. Yours only has cotton threads. Are you acting rich, too? Babe, is he telling the truth? Of course not. What does a bodyguard know about luxury clothes? You're not fit to be my watchdog! You don't use mouthwash, do you? Your breaths stink. Think of the rest of us. But what manners do you folks have? We're on our way to a Michelin restaurant. We have no time wasting on you two. Stop talking nonsense. Pay up. Diana, you're no better than me. Why think so highly of yourself? We are different. My parents belong to higher status. Your broke parents and you are nothing but rats in the sewers. You aren't qualified! Calm down. She's not worth it. Come, hit me! you'll have to pay more. I can pay you, but you'll regret it soon. Hahaha! Regret it soon? You're the ones to regret it soon. After paying us, are you eating dirt or grass yourselves? Why should we pay? You crashed into us. You're paying by all means! Go ask around there about who I am. No enemy of mine can survive long in Ollieville. Ask around? How? Know the fat scammer? Like that? How do you dare to say that? I'll pay you now. Get lost. We did nothing wrong. Why should we pay them? And we don't have that much money. Trust me. You'll watch a good show later. What are you two muttering about? Wanna run? Don't worry about the money. I'll take care of it. We shouldn't waste time on people like them. You got a hundred thousand dollars. Smart of you. Uh. . . Why did it come from Loyo Group? You mean the global powerhouse, Loyo Group? Loyo Group CEO is Mr. Lewis. You are also a Lewis. Who are you really? You're not fit to know. Jaden, what's going on? It's okay, don't worry. This is totally legal money. Mr. Lewis paid me in advance. That's why it came from Loyo Group. What's wrong with Claire? He used the company account. I see. I thought you're a big shot. Mr. Lewis seems pretty generous to you. You're not his boy toy, are you? Shut up. You got your money. I'm warning you, if insulting my husband again, I'll beat you up! Calm down. Since you got your money, get lost. Hey, stop glaring at me, loser. This money is worth just a dinner to us. Oops, I forgot. You two might not be able to save up that much toiling for a decade. Stop wasting time on them. Let's go. Jaden, is that how you spend money? You gave them a fortune. Don't be mad. I have a good show for you. How can we earn that much money? Come. The show has started. Hurry. Let's go. You're asking me what happened? This is the latest Porsche. Look what you've done to it. Did we crash into you? No one else here but us. You think I crashed my car? Pay for the damage, or you're not leaving! How much? Ten thousand dollars, enough? What? Do I look like a beggar? It's the latest Porsche model that's imported. One and only in Ollieville. You think that's enough? How much do you want? A hundred thousand dollars? Four hundred thousand dollars. You're trying to rob us! What now? You wanna get beat? Hit me, and I'll sue you! Diana, karma is quick to catch up to you. Rich folks like you two, don't tell me you can't pay. Who says we can't? Pay him. Babe, I don't have that much right now. Why don't you pay first? There you go. Babe, don't be mad. Babe. Don't be mad. Serves you right, scammers! I'm so happy now. I can even eat three people's food. Let's go. What's the deal between you and Diana? Seems you two have bad relations. She was my classmate in university. She was cozying up to me all the time. At first, I thought she was being friendly. Turned out that she got close to me to steal my works and call them hers. Then, you must really hate those who deceive you. Yeah, can't stand at all. My parents got deceived and ended up bankrupt. They both jumped from a building. But it's over now. Why are you asking this now? Did you deceive me? Of course not! Why would I deceive you? That's good. You and Grandma are the closest people to me in the entire world. Looks like I can't tell her my identity yet. Stop sitting there. Go to bed. Gotta work tomorrow. Off the lights, please. Thank you. Diana? Why are you here? My uncle is a director at Loyo Group. I can come here whenever I want. So proud of being a nepo baby. Unique of you. You are envious. I'm hearing from you. Do you have a director uncle? Do you have my talent? Talent? What talent? A street vendor's talent? You don't know, do you? Shelly here sells stuff on the street. She got in here by pure luck. You really think so highly of yourself. Get back to work. We're not here for drama. What? You're afraid of her? Let me tell you I have an invitation to Loyo Group's anniversary party. Guess I don't have to tell you what to do if you wanna join. I heard it will be held at the luxurious Cloud Grange, and there will be a collection of valuables on display. It's said they're showcasing a rare gem acquired by a mysterious buyer. It's worth millions of dollars. Only those with big contributions to the company can attend. Diana, can you let us tag along? As long as you behave yourselves, of course, I can. Really? Diana, you're so pretty and nice. Right, not like Shelly here. I doubt if she knows what a party is. Take your fawning somewhere else. I gotta work here. Love working that much? Here, let me help you. If you can get these samples done, I can be charitable and let you tag along. This is your job, not mine. I don't want to attend the anniversary party with someone like you. Look at you, a street vendor acts all holier-than-thou. Yeah. Believe it or not, one word from Diana's uncle can get you fired from here. Stop it. We were classmates, after all. I won't get you fired. Your husband, though. . . What do you mean? Your husband's the CEO's bodyguard. My uncle's a director there. He can hire a new bodyguard with just the snap of a finger. This is between us. Don't drag him into this. I know you're gonna say that. Work hard. Let's go. Send it back. Calling me at this hour. Missing me? He was frowning just now. A call from Mrs. Lewis makes him smile. Looks like he's really falling for her. What's up? I'm working overtime later. Don't wait for me. Just head home. There's food in the fridge, and you can heat it up. Gotta work now, bye! Is she taking too much advantage of the triple overtime pay? Should I cancel the term, then? No. Let her earn her money. Make a call. Order some takeout from Cloud Nine. I'll take it to her later. Got it. What are you doing here? Thought you might be hungry. I'm not hungry. Dig in. Cloud Nine? Is this the restaurant charging a thousand dollars per capita? Jaden, are you. . . Of course not. I'm the CEO's bodyguard, right? So, for his safety, I test out his food in case poison inside all the time. These were given by him. Looks like he has it pretty rough, worrying about poisons and all. Luckily, we're just average people. Yum! I wanna test his food, too. Silly, you're earning triple the salary here. Still want more work? I'm not earning triple for this work. Why not? Why can't you claim overtime? These are my colleagues' tasks. They all wanna attend the anniversary party, so they dumped these on me. Hey, do you know about the party? Of course. Why? Do you wanna go? None of designers doesn't wanna attend a big party and look at the guests' clothes? But it's just a thought. I know we can't go. Your colleagues can't attend, either, can they? Why did they make you do all of these? Normal employees can't attend. But Diana can. Her uncle's a director here. That's why they pushed me out. Where are you going? I'll go teach them a lesson! Forget it. We're all the same here, just average employees. Don't get mad over this. It's not worth it. Besides, we don't know who her uncle is. Then, how about this? You take a rest, I'll take over from here. Do you know how? Of course. I'm just a bodyguard, but I've been with Mr. Lewis for years. Picked up a lot along the way. Just some samples. I got this. Okay, have a try, then. It's done. Let's go. So quick? A masterpiece should be admired in daylight. Let's see it tomorrow. Let's go home. God! How can I sleep here? Seen enough? Want a close-up? Ah, sorry. I was wondering if we can sleep together tonight. No, that's not what I mean. I just want to ask if we can share the bed. No, what am I talking about? I mean, there's a leak in the roof, so the sofa's wet. We're husband and wife. What's wrong with sharing a bed? Lie down. I'll get the lights. I'm here because I can't sleep on the wet sofa. Do you hear me? What? Why are you getting so close? I didn't hear you. Say it again. No. I'll sleep. What are you doing? What do you think? I just want a dry bed to sleep on, nothing else. What else do you think I want? What do you want -then? I'm hot. Stop moving. Stay still. I asked you for designs, and this is your attitude? What's wrong, Geoff? Shelly Jones! Stop. This is your own sample. You mean I embroider your samples. What are you saying? Enough! You are disqualified for the selection. Deduct three months' salary. Geoff. Shelly's design is good. The customer likes it. The position of our director is vacant. Shelly will be the director of the design department in the future. This is the invitation of our company anniversary, as a reward for your good work. Thank you. Geoff. You should learn from Shelly. Don't form cliques in the office. Concentrate on your work. Got it? What are you doing? Give it back to me. Don't worry. Soon. What are you doing? I. . . I made great efforts to get this. Oh? Do you think you can meet the prince at the party like Cinderella? Stop dreaming. The reality is you don't have ten dollars in your pocket. You even don't have a decent formal dress. How will you attend the party? Just stay in the gutter. Don't move. I meet you. You are pretty. Why didn't you tell me you were here? This is my mom. Er. Auntie. Don't call me auntie. Yeah. Oh, so pretty! Hahaha. You brat! I told you in advance, is that a surprise? Shelly is so beautiful. Why didn't you tell me? Look at that figure. She is like a fairy. So charming! Right? Ah, Mom. You are beautiful, too. You're a great fairy. Ah, hahaha. Oh, right. This is a green jade bangle I bought in Rhydale. It just fits for young girls like you. Look, It's so pretty. Mom, it's so expensive. I can't take it. You have to take it. There are more. Wait. These are just a few. As for the dresses, I've asked the royal designers of Rhydale to design it for you. And these necklace jewelries. I bought them by auction. If you like something, just tell me. I'll buy it for you. Your family is so rich. No, they are fake. My mom likes watching TV dramas and learnt from them. Right, Mom? If you scare her off, you'll regret it. Hahaha. Yeah, he is right. Hahaha. What are those bodyguards? They are my colleagues. People in our line of work are warm-hearted. So, they helped her pick them up. Haha. Hahahaha. Shelly. Just take them. This is my regard. Thank you, Mom. But I'm an office worker, I don't need these. Don't you have a party to go to? How did you know that? I'm Mr. Lewis' bodyguard. I know all the Mr. Lewis' arrangement. Oh, so it is. But now, I can't go there. What's wrong? My invitation was torn up. Who did that to you? Mom. Don't scare her. Hahaha. Shelly, If someone bullies you just tell me. Even Jaden can't bully you. Mom. Ah. Be at ease. I won't bully her. Here you are. Why do you have it? The gift for the boss's bodyguard. If you give it to me, how will you get there? Don't worry. His face can help him. His face? I can ask Mr. Lewis for a new one. Is that okay? Sure, I can. Trust me. Even with the invitation, I don't have any decent dresses. I'd rather not go. Just keep it. Why don't you have? But aren't these all fake? Just trust my mom. These fakes are just like the real ones. Others can't recognize them. But I'm the designer. I can't wear a fake dress there. The dress is easy to deal with. I can design it myself. But the jewelry. . . Come on. This one is my dowry. It's not valuable, but it's real. You can take it to the party. This means too much. I can't take it. Take it. Why not? Shelly, we're a family. Don't be shy. Just take it. Thank you, Mom. Not at all. Let me help you to put it on. It is indeed the anniversary party of Loyo Group. The whole world-renowned Cloud Grange was booked. There also is a golden tunnel. I heard only those worth billions can walk that golden tunnel. And, you know that. The Cloud Grange also belongs to the Loyo Group. It is said that even the lawn here is valued at ten thousand dollars a square. Thanks for Diana bringing us here. So we can see these. It's easy. Let's get in. Let's go. Isn't this Shelly? Why is she here? Thank you, sir. Is this too high-key? It's better to cover it. Oh, I was wondering who this was. Oh? Try to sneak into the party. Didn't you see I walked right in here? Are you blind? Attending the party? Do you have an invitation? It's none of your business. She wants to sneak into. Lady, no invitation, no entry. If you want to break in, you'll be in the security room. Do you hear that? Just go home. If you go into the security room, it's hard to get out. This is my invitation. This is a supreme invitation. It seems this lady is a big shot. I can't offend her. Shelly. Do you think we're stupid? Your invitation is different from ours. Ours are all blue. Yours is red. Yes. You must be insane. Security. Throw her out. Lady, this way, please. What! Security guard, are you blind? You let her, a vendor, go this way. Does she deserve it? She has the supreme invitation. Yours is a normal invitation. If she doesn't deserve it, you certainly don't. You. . . So fast. I'll go to the break room. Mr. Lewis. Shelly. This is not an ordinary party. Wearing knockoffs, don't you feel shameful? What the hell is wrong with you? As a costume designer, I wear a dress of my own design to the party, why is it shameful? Indeed, you can't afford a luxury! At the party today, I don't want to argue with you. Distinguished guests, sorry to tell you that the original exhibition of green jade earrings has been cancelled for the collector's sake. What's the matter? I came here only for the green jade earrings. I've heard the green jade earrings have been kept by a mystery collector for decades. Even the museum can't borrow it. It seems that we can't see it today. How does it come? The green jade earrings have been bought by my family from that collector. What! Diana. You mean the green jade earrings that value two hundred million dollars are in your hand! That's right. Fortunately, my dad was in charge of the exhibition. He knew the collector never lent the earrings, or I couldn't ask a factory to make a replacement. Well done, Diana. Your family could afford the green jade earrings. Only Diana deserves to wear such earrings. Well, Is there any lucky chance for us to see the earrings? Yeah, yeah. Since you all want to see them, Let me show you the green jade earrings. These are the green jade earrings with two hundred million dollars. How come are the earrings just like the ones Mom gave me? The green jade earrings! My God, it's worth it. Diana. Your family is too rich. Two hundred million dollars! Shelly. Why leave? Jealous? No. Really? Everyone can see it. Is that true? She also wears the green jade earrings. They're exactly the same size. Are there two pairs of earrings? No way. Green jade is rare. The Jade King is even rarer. The green jade earrings are the only ones in the world. One of them is definitely a fake. Shelly. I know you like comparison. But I didn't expect you to wear fakes brazenly. Let alone my earrings. Yours are definitely fake. The light has a waxy appearance with a faint bluish-purple glow, which is clearly the color of the reflected light of organic glue. What she said is right. My family sells jewelry. I learnt that a lot. Ah! The surface of her earrings does have the natural grain that is characteristic of jadeite. Maybe her earrings are real. If Shelly's earrings are real, Diana's will be fake! Think about it. How could mine be a fake? They just don't be maintained. The lighting is also bad. Yeah. Diana's family is so rich. How could she wear fakes? Shelly, you are jealous. Take someone down a peg! You don't know that. Shelly, is an orphan and a pedlar. She couldn't afford a decent dress for the party, so she made this dress herself. How can she have the real green jade earrings? What? You, such a person, can be at the Loyo Group's party. Shouldn't you go to the kitchen? Humph. I can't believe we're cheated by this crooked woman. Get her out of here. A poor, deceitful woman is not welcome at this party. Yeah. Get her out of here. Dare you to wear fakes. It's Mom's dowry. Why, do Fingers itch? Release her. Get a doctor here. Don't worry. I'm here. I thought it was someone else. Mr. Lewis' bodyguard. Why? To protect your poor wife! Who do you think you are to protect her? Don't you know that your wife was wearing fakes, and come to the Loyo Group's party? That's really brazen! I think you are all blind. Do you have any proof that my wife is wearing fakes? If not, then shut up. We don't need any proof. You two are too poor to buy the earrings. The green jade earrings are worth two hundred million dollars! Yeah. Do you think we're blind? I think you are really blind. You should know that only the real jade can't be corrupted by strong acid. This is a strong acid. Next, let me prove it. You just said your earrings were real. Then, throw it in. Why should I listen to you? Why? Are you afraid? Fine. But, after you. It's not corrupted. The earring is real. That's impossible. You two must be in cahoots. If you don't believe it, you can try it. It seems that this lady's earring is real. I've told you the color and gloss was top good. The jade is good, but the pretty base was trampled. Mom's dowry is so expensive. But it is broken. What to do? Fine. Don't worry. You're more important than that. Diana. Why did you wear fakes to the party? Yeah. You know nothing. This is clearly their scam. Why don't you believe me, but believe what a bodyguard and a vendor said? Stop fooling yourself. What about the earring you broke? Yes. The green jade earrings worth more than two hundred million dollars. Except for the compensation, she may be taken to the police for damaging others' property. You. . . What are you doing? Let go of me. My uncle is a director of Loyo Group. How dare you to bully me. When he arrives, you'll regret it. Who dares to bully Diana? It's me. Mr... Mr. Lewis. Is Sheely's husband Mr. Lewis of Loyo Group? How could that be? Yes, impossible. I'm Mr. Lewis' bodyguard. Were you looking for Mr. Lewis just now but failed? Ah, yeah, yes. Yeah. Seeing you, I thought Mr. Lewis was also here. Ah! A director feared a bodyguard. Impossible. I missed dinner. That was because of hypoglycemia. Release me. Let me go. Uncle, they bullied me. Fire them. I don't have the right. They're Mr. Lewis' bodyguards. Isn't that easy? You were spoiled too much that you're so rude. You hit me! I'm telling you. Diana. You're expelled from Gray's family. From now on, you're not a Gray anymore. I'll kick Diana out. Our Gray family will pay double for the green jade earrings. Is that okay? Diana always bullies my wife. She broke my mom's dowry and hurt my wife. She is fired. Put her on the blacklist of Loyo Group and all its partners. The punishment will ruin the rest of her life. Don't worry. It's clear that Diana's uncle is joking. But the bodyguard took it seriously. Uncle. You're kidding, right? Look at yourselves, indeed a poor couple. How could you threaten my uncle by the power of Mr. Lewis? Today, I'll let my uncle fire two of you and get you to the police. Uncle, come on. Fire them. Don't drag me down. I'll do it as you told very seriously. Uncle, are you crazy? Why did you listen to a loser? Shut up. If you go on, it won't be so easy to be covered. She is too young to know anything. Please forgive her. In the future, anyone who bullies my wife, Shelly, is against me, Jaden Lewis, and Loyo Group. Let's go. Shelly. Shelly. Uncle. Why did you do that to me? I'm your niece. The Grays really spoiled you. Do you know you offended a big shot? A big shot! Who? Shelly is just a vendor. Her man is just a poor bodyguard. I can bully them at will. What's the matter? That poor bodyguard is the president of Loyo Group, Jaden Lewis. It's impossible. How could her husband be the president of Loyo Group? No way. Believe it or not. I've tried my best to help you. The president of Loyo Group has an arranged marriage partner. Why did he marry Shelly? Do me a favor. Shelly. Why are you angry? Don't you hide something from me? Can a bodyguard make a powerful director do that to his niece? Mom's dowry is worth two hundred million dollars. What does that mean? It means you're not an ordinary person. Wait a minute. I can explain it. Four hundred million is on account. What else do you want to say? I hate someone lied to me. It was me. I asked Jaden to do that. This was our plan. We did that to look for those bad company executives. So, I asked Jaden to work with me on this play. Yeah. What about the green jade earrings? That is my mom's heirloom. My grandpa's family has been rich before. It's a misunderstanding. Then, I'll return the money to you. It's no need. Well. Such a big misunderstanding made you almost get into a fight. The four hundred million dollars is yours now. Hahaha. That's a lot. Not a lot. I have something to do. I'm gonna go. What are you looking at? Come on. Let's go home. What are you thinking? It was so weird. What? I mean, Does Mr. Lewis like me? Sorry, my bad. It's fine. Why do you think like this? Here is the thing. Okay. Go ahead. Mr. Lewis doesn't know me before, but he always helps me whatever happens. I was promoted last time. This time, he gave me four hundred million dollars. So, I think he might like me at first sight. Do you think it's better to have a boss as your husband? Of course not. I'm not a greedy woman. Even if Mr. Lewis is good and rich, I won't like him. Okay. Yesh. Well. Do you like me, uh? I. . . Guess yourself. I won't tell you. Little girl. Forget about that. Maybe Mr. Lewis doesn't care. Oh, by the way. What to do with the money? I'll take you somewhere tomorrow. Ah! Is this that place? Yes. Malory. Shelly. You haven't been here in a while. They all miss you. I'm a little busy lately. I'll come and see you often. So, you are giving the money to the nursing home. Yeah. Malory. The one hundred million dollars is for the nursing home. Oh, no. It's too much money. These years, you've given us much. Malory, don't worry. I have money. Nursing homes are not-for-profit and subsiste on donations. I know you are in a difficult time now. For these old people, you should take it. You're a good girl. I'm gonna tell them you're back. We'll see you in a minute. Well. Do you mind if I spend the money like this? Of course not. The money is yours. You're the boss. What about the remaining three hundred million dollars? I won't spend them. Save them? Indeed, The interest each month is enough for you. I'm going to donate the three hundred million dollars. Donate? I want to start a charity to help the victims of the war. But I don't know what to do. Can you help me consult Mr. Lewis? I'll handle this. Well. Don't you leave some? I'm still young. I can make money. Let's go. They are waiting for us. I think I'm falling for her. Sir, madam. Shelly is here. Who is he? This is my husband. It's weird. He looks familiar. I should see you in the financial news. You're Loyo Group's. . . Well, let me think about it. Oh, right. The president. Sir. You must have made a mistake. Right. He is a normal worker like me. He isn't the president. I saw the president of Loyo Group on the television looking just like you. It seems you are right. I see. He stood by the president as a bodyguard. You got him wrong. Yeah, yeah. I'm the bodyguard of president Really? It seems that you delivered a speech somewhere before. Maybe, we're too old to remember it clearly. Shelly. Since your husband is here, don't miss the waltz ball tonight. The waltz ball? It's a nursing home activity. You'll know it tonight. Jaden, My shoes fell off. Still dancing? Just dance like this. Now, do you like me? Yes. I also like you. I only like you. It's nice. Can you give me the e-photo? Sure. But, you need to promise me one thing. Okay. What's that? Shelly has suffered a lot. Then, her parents all passed away. As a child, she lived with another family. Her uncle and aunt didn't like her. At childhood, compared to other kids, she was more sensible and stronger. I know. She has been a strong and kind girl. So, even if you don't love her in the future, I hope you don't hurt her. Shelly is really a good girl. Malory, be at ease. I have put Shelly in my heart. At any time, I won't let her get hurt. What are you talking about? Nothing. Malory was telling me something. Let's get back early. We'll see them some other time. Okay. If only my parents were still alive, I could take good care of them. Shelly. In the future, I'll be with you forever. Shelly. Madison returns home tomorrow. At half past eight tomorrow, we'll have dinner at Peninsula. Do you hear me? Don't let Jaden go there with me. Zoe's family is always mean. If they know Jaden is a bodyguard, they will embarrass Jaden. Shelly. Do you hear me? I know. Text me the address and time. I will go there. Jaden, My cousin returned home, and there's a family party at the Peninsula Hotel at eight tomorrow night. Do you want me to go with you? It's no need. Just a dinner. Ok. Mr. Lewis. This is an annual plan of the overseas branch. Look. Shelly went to a family party at Peninsula. Take some wine from the collection. President has been workaholic, he interrupts working for such a matter! Mr. Lewis really falls in love. Cough. Yes. Mr. Lewis' wine is for the lady wearing this dress. Who is this? Mrs. Lewis. Oh. Yes, Sir. Get a rest well since coming back. Welcome home. Shelly You're the youngest. Dare you to be late! I didn't mean to. I rode an electric bike. I didn't expect it to rain halfway. Madison. Is this your cousin? Why does she look like a beggar? It's her. Shelly. It's been years. Why do you still ride your electric bike? Hahaha. You're the poorest in our family. Smells like a rat. It's disgusting! Shelly. You don't know that. Madison and Barry bought the latest Porsche. Beg Madison. She may be kind enough to let you take a seat in the trunk. Hahaha. Porsche. I don't like it. It pollutes air. Shelly. You bitch. Why are you wearing the same dress as me? I bought it in a shop. What's wrong? Shelly. You don't deserve to compare with Madison. Madison is excellent and gets married to Barry, a millionaire. What about you? You're twenty-eight and single. Do you want to be a nun? We're relatives. So, I can introduce my uncle to you. My uncle is sixty-one years old. Every month, he would get a pension with tens of thousands in savings. But his four wives have passed away. He also has seven or eight kids. Nice. For Shelly, He is good enough. I'm sorry. I have a husband. What? You are married. Why didn't you tell us? You never answer my calls, preventing me asking for money. What are you saying? This is a family party. How about calling your husband over? He is busy. Ah! What are you doing? Hello. You're Shelly's husband. Right? Why didn't you come to our family party? Is it because you are too poor to meet us? You. . . Shelly. What's wrong? Excuse me. Our manager prepared the wine for the lady wearing a green dress. Islay whiskey. I heard the wine costs six million dollars a bottle. So expensive! One drop is almost a thousand dollars. A green dress. Madison and Shelly are both in green dresses. Is the wine for Madison or Shelly? It must be for Madison. Shelly is just a bumpkin. How can she know the manager? Yeah. Madison is too excellent, so, the manager wanna please her. It must be for Madison, not for others. Sure. The girl I, Barry Jacob, select, must be outstanding. Not like this beggar. Stop. Since the manager has sent the wine, let's have a taste together. Wait. Pick up my phone first. Just a phone. You value it, right! Madison. This is Islay whiskey. It's worth over six million dollars a bottle. Does Shelly deserve that good wine? Hum, it is. Bumpkins don't deserve good things. Claire. Prepare a car. Let's go to the Peninsula. Yeah. She could only eat Madison's leftovers since childhood. She doesn't deserve the wine. Shelly. You, a rat, can only drink sewage underground. Madison. It has been years. You're still so mean. Watch your words. You'll have your own day. You dare to curse me! I. . . Who dares to hurt my wife? Shelly. Are you okay? Why are you here? I'm worried about you. You bullied my wife! Wife? You're Shelly's husband. Dressed so decent. Aren't you a barman? Shelly. Even if you wanna get married, you can't marry a barman. They're dirty. Indeed, if one's mind is not right, everything will be wrong in her eyes. What? Get out of here. Don't spoil our fun. You don't deserve the wine. I sent the wine to my wife. If she doesn't deserve it, do you deserve it? What? This wine is from you. Is Shelly's husband a big shot? Impossible. How could Shelly marry a rich man? Oh, I remembered. At Loyo Group's anniversary party, I saw him. He is Mr. Lewis 's bodyguard. Turns out a bodyguard. Stop pretending. It's over six million a bottle. You said you sent it! Are you dreaming? Barry. Leave him alone. Just a couple of clowns. If this wine is from me, what would you do then? If the wine is for that beggar, my wife will kneel and call her Grandmother. Hey. Why don't you mention yourself? Fine, Madison. Anyway, it can't be true. Great. You, tell me. Who is the wine for? This is for. . . this lady. What! Is the Islay whiskey worth four million dollars for Shelly? Aren't you awake? My wife is also in a green dress. It's for that beggar! No way. Why is the wine for Shelly? Maybe there's a misunderstanding. Shelly doesn't deserve such good wine. Yeah. Shelly the name of the wine. Why is it for her? You should kneel and ask Shelly Grandma now. I know. They must be acting for the sake of face. Sure enough. Shelly, You married a bodyguard and hired actors for this. So shameless! Acting? You're not only blind but also out of mind. Oh? Got caught. Are you afraid? Madison. I didn't expect your cousin to be a liar. Yes. Shelly. If your parents in heaven know you stoop so low, what will they think? Shut up. You don't deserve to mention my parents. Shelly. You're ungrateful. How dare you yell at Madison? Don't forget. After your parents passed away, who brought you up? These years, my life at your home is good or bad, you know it best. Ingrate! Dad. Shelly. Your husband is so rude, he dared hit your elders! You're so disrespectful. I'll never respect you. You Shelly. You must spend much on these actors. Don't wrong me. We didn't hire them. You didn't, but your man did. Shelly. If you're not my cousin, do you think you can enter the hotel? Right. You'd better recognize yourselves. not to affect Madison's mood. You two losers stop playing the show. If you dare keep insulting my wife, don't blame me for being rude. Bro, were you a clown before? Still pretending! You're broke, right? We know that. For your dignity. My husband and I wouldn't hire actors. Really? You. Tell us. Are you the actors he hired? I will pay you double. Lady, you get us wrong. Lady, you misunderstand. We are regular employees here, not actors. Yes. Peninsula Hotel won't allow actors to play as waiters. You misunderstand. Shelly. Great job. Where did you hire these actors? So dedicated! They look like so real. Humph. This bottle is with poor packing and the color is not pure. There are impurities clearly. Shelly. If you want to act, get some good wine. Poor taste! These Islay whiskeys are limited. The wine and package were all handmade. It's normal not knowing it for people like you. It's so funny. Something Limited? It must be your another trick! Be careful. Too much lying. Yourself might even believe it. Pretend to be rich. Madison. I bought some good wine. Tonight, let's celebrate alone. Okay. Barry. Shelly. See? My husband gives a thousand pocket money each month. And he prepares a surprise for me. What about yours? Haha. He is just playing dramas with you. I lived better than you before, and I still do now. Madison. After so many years, you still haven't changed your habit of comparison. Aren't you tired? You're more tired of hiring actors and buying fake wine. This bottle of wine only costs a few dollars at most. It only deserves to be broken for fun. Well. Mr. Lewis is so nice. His wife came here for a banquet. I got a seventy million investment. Really rich. Oh, yeah. Hello. List Mrs. Lewis as a supreme VIP customer of our hotel. Whenever Mrs. Lewis visits here, she must be served the best. Geoff, someone is making trouble. What! Lady, this wine isn't yours. You went too far. Just a bottle of fake wine. I'll pay for it. And I'll take the rest of them. Smash them to make my baby happy. Honey, you're so sweet. Shelly, did you hear that? I'm better in education and background. I even have a better taste in choosing a husband. You can smash them as long as you can afford them. Don't look down on me. These fake wines are worth no more than sixty dollars. I'll smash the bottles as long as you serve them. Tell me, how much are these wines? This bottle of Islay whiskey costs about six million dollars. Here are six bottles. With the oddment off, they cost thirty-six million dollars. Thirty-six million dollars? Both of you are crazy. Are you scamming? Two bumpkins. Do you think we'll believe whatever you say? Shelly, your husband is so bad. A pair of liars. You'll ruin our reputation. I believe my husband. Shelly, use your head. Maybe you're deceived, but you don't know it. If these wines are worth such much money, then, I'll pay you one billion dollars. But, they're tokens. Haha. Hey, Geoff, you come at the right time. I want you to throw them out now. They are annoying. Idiot. It's you that should get out. Are you insane? How dare you talk to me like this? I'm a VIP of the hotel. I'll complain about you. Exactly. My son-in-law is from Jacob Group. How dare you talk to us like this? Do you want to lose your job? Just a manager. Believe it or not. With a call, I can get you fired now. Jacob Group? It's nothing. Do you know who he is? Who is he? Just a safeguard. So what? Could it be that he does a part-time job? Such as a barman? Hahahaha. How dare you! He is. . . Enough. Geoff, you don't have to waste time on them. Tell them, how much are these wines? Got it, Sir. This wine is a collector-edition Islay whiskey. Each bottle costs about six million dollars. What are you talking about? Oh, I see. You colluded with Shelly to scam, right? You'd better think twice. Colluding others to scam is illegal. I didn't make a mistake. This bottle of wine is sent by Claire, who works in Loyo Group. Moreover, this is Loyo Group's CEO. . . CEO's guard. Ah? Yes, the CEO's guard. As we are relatives, you don't have to pay for them all. As for the wine you smashed, I'll round down the figure. Six million dollars. How are you going to pay? How can I have such much money? I can't even chip in the money in a short time. Shelly, you are an ingrate! Your uncle and I have raised you for so many years. It's just a bottle of wine. How dare you ask Madison to pay for it? I tell you, even if she smashes all of them, you can't ask for a cent from her. Zoe, do you think I'm still a child, who could only accept all your malice? I tell you, I've grown up. I'll never be bullied by you. You must pay for the wine today. Shelly, who do you think you are? Believe it or not, I'll. . . Hey. It's a law-ruling society now. You can beat me. But don't cry when you're caught. You can refuse to pay for it. Mr. Miller, call the police. Okay, Sir. I just came back. If I'm caught, my career will be ruined. Wait a minute. I'll pay for it. Don't look down on me. Honey? Me? Ouch. I have a stomachache. I want to go to the bathroom. No! Madison, is this what your husband is? You don't know anything. Hahaha. I don't know. Then you should pay for it. Received a transfer. Seven hundred thousand dollars. Madison, you just came back. So you should get used to it. It's six million dollars. Why the rush? When I gain the reward from the project I invested, I'll give you the money. Sure. Write an IOU. Shelly, you go too far. She's given you the money. Why should she write an IOU? It's your duty. Without an IOU, what if you refuse to pay the rest? Do you want to deny it? Is that OK? Yes. I'll be waiting for your installment. I'll check it. If I don't receive the money, I'll see you in the court. Jaden, what's going on with those wines? How did you get them? Do you have anything that doesn't tell me? Shelly, calm down. Let me explain. Say it. The CEO was in the danger before. I protected him. So, the CEO awarded me with those wines. Well. . . Did you get hurt? Nope. Touch me when we're back. It's really uneasy to be a CEO. His food may be poisoned. And he may be in the danger. Indeed. It's uneasy. Jaden? What? I feel strange about another thing. Why do they always show their respect to you? Uh. . . Maybe it's because I'm the CEO's guard. You know, Powerful people's secretaries and guards are also powerful. Just like emperor's eunuch. If you put it this way, that's right. I'm starving. I was busy arguing, forgot to eat. How about having some food here? No, we need to save money. We earned a sum of money. It'll be transferred to Grandma. She's in the nursing home. So she must need money. Let's go. I'll cook for you. OK. The package is big. It takes space. Jaden, I'll go downstairs. Where's the salt? Soy sauce is also OK. It tastes bland. The waste collector ripped me off. He deliberately shorted two cents. Humph! Hey? Are you drunk? The smell is so strong. I didn't drink wine. How was that possible? This is wine. Did you drink that whole thing? Isn't that soy sauce? This is wine. Did you lose the sense of taste? Why couldn't you taste it? I could taste it. I thought it contained cooking wine. You're drunk. I'll make a juice to wake you up. It turns out to be the feeling of being drunk. However, why can I feel it when I'm sober? It seems when you're by my side, my heart beats faster. I just want to get close to you. Much closer. As long as you're with me, the air is sweet. Why are you so drunk? You start talking nonsense. That isn't nonsense. That's the truth. Shelly, I. . . I always want to tell you a secret. But don't leave me, ok? What's that? Just say it. Shelly, I always want to tell you but I. . . I'm afraid I'll lose you. In fact, I am Loyo Group. . . Jaden? Last night, what did he want to say? Expressing his love? Oh my gosh. So shameful. Are you Shelly Jones? Yes. What's wrong? Ah! Who are you? Are you insane? My name is Yvonne Sutton. I'm here to warn you. Don't touch others' things. Otherwise, I'll make your life suffer. Shelly, I brought Ms. Sutton here. What will you do? You made me suffer a lot. I will make you pay the price. Yvonne? Isn't she from the Sutton family? I heard that she's going to marry Mr. Lewis. But I feel she seems to have hatred with Shelly. Could it be that Shelly has a relationship with Mr. Lewis? Impossible. I remember Shelly's husband is Mr. Lewis's guard. Yeah. Did you make a mistake? How is that possible? You seduced my fiance. Mr. Lewis, you were just drunk in front of Shelly. That isn't a big deal. You don't have to go to a bar to prove yourself. You know nothing. Every man wants to be perfect in front of his lover, also his drinking capacity. Jaden? You talked to the wrong person. This is Mr. Lewis. Wait. What are you doing? We haven't made things clear. Shelly, I want to tell you a secret. What? Jaden. I haven't seen you in years. I know you have a lot to tell me. Take your time. What are you doing? Are you crazy? Maniac. Still watching us? Deduct your salary. Why did you walk so fast? Do you know that woman? No, I don't. I'm just afraid. That woman often mistakes me for Mr. Lewis. Last time, she quarreled with Mr. Lewis but beat me really hard. I'd better go away from her. Uh, when you see her, keep away from her. I see. Mr. Lewis should treat you well. Oh. Why did you find me? I want to explain what happened last night. Actually, I can drink like a fish. Alright. You can drink like a fish. Don't you believe me? Let's prove it. Jaden, where are you going with her? Mr. Lewis, do you need to take her to see the doctor? You! How dare you beat my woman? Jaden, why are you still protecting her? I've been abroad for one year. And you found this woman to make me jealous. You should have found a better woman. Enough. Don't flatter yourself. Between us, there is nothing relations. You don't have to be jealous. By the way, she's my wife. Show some respect! . Jaden, you really make me confused. Mr. Lewis is there, right? Why did she make this mistake? Mr. Lewis? Jaden, I thought you really loved this poor girl. To my surprise, you're not serious. What do you mean? I'll explain it later. Don't listen to her. What? Jaden, you're the liar. A man from a rich family falls in love with a poor girl. This will only happen in a movie. I advise you to get real. Jaden is. . . Enough. I can shut up, but you should talk with me alone. Okay. Are they trying to hide anything? Forget it. I'll wait for Jaden to tell me. Yvonne, I won't marry you anyway. And I have a wife. I love her very much. Jaden, do you know how many girls want to be your wife? If I spread some news, making others know your wife is just a poor girl, what do you think they will do? If you dare to hurt my wife, I'll fight back. I have only one request. If you agree with it, I'll hide this fact. Say it. One week later, attend my birthday banquet. Okay. Jaden, do you hide something? In fact, I. . . What? In fact, I'm. . . Jaden, The land overseas meets a problem. I have to check it on my own. You should be with me. Okay. Shelly, when I'm back, I will tell you everything. Shelly, we got an order. The client appointed you to design a bohemian-style coat. We've got a substantial deposit. How can I connect with him? I need to discuss the details with him. No need. The client only asked to show the bohemian style. He doesn't want any design. Be real. Be poor. Be down to earth. His requests are too strange. Just do as he said. Although Mr. Lewis cares about Shelly much, Ms. Sutton is not only from the Sutton family but also Mr. Lewis's fiancee. Supporting Ms. Sutton must be the best choice. Mr. Miller, the coat is finished. I'll send you the address. Deliver the coat by yourself. Ms. Sutton, everything is ready. Yvonne deserves the reputation as the top socialite in Ollieville. Her birthday banquet is grand. It's rare to see it. She deserves it. Don't you know that Yvonne's fiance is the CEO of Loyo Group. I heard he would also attend the banquet. But doesn't Mr. Lewis always refuse to attend any banquets like this? Yvonne is his fiancee. I believe he will come. Right, Yvonne? Of course. Jaden will attend it. By the way, I've asked you to prepare things. Are they ready? Don't worry, Yvonne. Everything is ready. A second-hand motorbike is fragile. Luckily, I know how to fix it. Well done. It's disgusting. What a bad smell. You're so dirty. Did you climb out of a sewer? Didn't she take a shower? She smells bad. I almost vomited up. It's the coat you asked for. I'll put it here. Wait! I haven't seen the coat. How can you leave? Do you want to damage Galactic Design's reputation? What do you want? Take out the coat. In half a month, if you have any problems, you can contact us. Put them on. Why are you standing still? I say put them on and make a show. If you don't do that, how can I know if the design is satisfying? Are you unwilling to do that? Don't tell me you're not satisfied with your design. Wow, so beautiful. Turn around slowly. Show me the details. You're indeed a talent in designing. In this coat, you really look like a beggar. This shows your poverty vividly. Her smell. Her look. She looks exactly like a beggar. The money can get you through a month. You don't have to do anything but beg and asking for money. Enough. I have no interest playing with you. Where are you going? You haven't seen the big gift Yvonne prepared. This needle is specially prepared for the poor tailor. How about helping you use it? Hold her. Where do you think I should start? I would like to try this needle. Stop. Or I'll call the police. The pain in fingers is sharp. How about starting from your hand? I just want to help you to be healthy. You should thank me. Stop. You're so noisy. It's quiet now. I'm sorry. You're so dirty. I'll bathe you. Look at me. Look at there. Come on. Shoot here. The CEO of Loyo Group is here. Jaden. Let me introduce him. This is my fiance, the CEO of Loyo Group, Jaden Lewis. Stop your nonsense. Are you the CEO of Loyo Group? I'm just an ordinary employee. I earn two thousand dollars per month without house or car. I gain the money in a legal way. I asked Mr. Lewis to pay me in advance. So it was transferred from there. Fake. They are all fake. My mom loves watching dramas. She learnt from them. Shelly, why are you here? What's wrong? Can't I attend the banquet? I didn't mean it. Don't touch me. So everywhere are traces. Only am I a fool. Only I believe you, a terrible liar. Let me explain. On this business trip, I needed to have a secret meeting. I couldn't contact anyone. The moment I came back, I called you, but you didn't answer it. I'm here to tell you we've been married for half a year. During past months, you had so many chances to tell me the truth. But you didn't. You want to tell me now. Do you think I will believe you? Shelly, who do you think you are? Look at your own identify. You are just a rich man's play doll. Why should he explain to you? Exactly. Turn your camera on and look at your face. You look horrible. Agree. Everything you have is not a quarter as good as Yvonne's. Why can you be Mr. Lewis's wife? If you dare to say another word, I'll mute you for the rest of your life. Shelly, I'll take you to see a doctor. I said. Don't touch me. I never wanted to marry a rich man. I just wanted to find a man and lived a normal life. But you have deceived me since the first day we met. What did you think? Did you worry I want your money? I. . . I know that rich men always try their best to gain reputation and profits. But I, Shelly Jones, just want to earn money with my own hands. Don't I deserve a sincere and pure relationship? It's not like that. I. . . I thought I've found my Mr. Right. In the end, I suddenly realized I've been cheated by you in the past six months. I had a suspicion a long time ago. But I still chose to believe you. You don't deserve my trust. You know what? Human is like a sycamore tree. Although it's hollow, it stands still. People think it will sprout next spring. But it has stopped planting in that winter Jaden, let's divorce. No. You're the only woman I want to marry. Enough. Stop showing your affection. In the past six months, I've seen it enough. Jaden, you don't need to feel sorry for her. I've been waiting for you. Even though Shelly abandons me, I won't love you. Jaden! Shelly, please don't go. I have something to tell you. Well, still want to pretend to be poor? I. . . I wanted to confess it, but when I knew your parents passed away because of scam, and you hated being cheated, I was afraid to tell you the truth. I was afraid I would lose you. So? You planned to cheat me for the rest of your life? No. I wanted to confess on that day. But the business trip. . . Confess? Do you remember that day you told me Yvonne mistook you for Mr. Lewis? Did you really want to confess? Or. . . you thought it was fun to trick me. You watched me live a poor life. Is it interesting for people like you who have high status? No, it isn't. My heart is yours. How can I make you feel sad? It's my fault. I make things worse. You can't empathize with the poor like me. We are in different worlds. Let me go. Surprisingly, Mr. Lewis really only loves that girl. Yeah. It seems Mr. Lewis really falls in love with that hick. Are you OK? Get out. I don't need you to tease me. Shelly, let's wait and see. Are you Diana Gray? This is Yvonne Sutton. Just follow your words. I'll make Shelly live a miserable life. Big liar. Shelly? Hasn't she come back? Find where my wife is. Where am I? Shelly, you are in my hand at last, aren't you? What do you want? At first, I wanted you to have fun. But now, I've changed my mind. Tomorrow morning, Jaden will marry Yvonne. I want you to witness Jaden marries another woman. This girl is very tender. I can't control myself. Ah! You're committing a crime. What? If it hadn't been for you, I wouldn't have met this end! Just wait here. Mr. Lewis. How is it going? I've sent all the guards to where she had visited. But I haven't received any news. IT Department is also working. But Mrs. Lewis's cellphone was thrown into the suburb, so. . . No matter what you do, you must find her. Got it, Sir. You're looking for Shelly, right? She's taken by me. If you want her to be safe, have a press conference and declare our marriage. What if I don't agree? Don't you fear that I'll destroy your family? You will agree with me, cause Shelly is in my control. I will marry you. But Shelly must be safe. Investigate Yvonne's recent calls. Tell me if there's anything wrong. OK. Ms. Sutton is here. Ms. Sutton and Mr. Lewis are perfect for each other. We will witness a wedding ceremony that sets the world on fire. Welcome to attend our wedding ceremony. That is Mr. Lewis' assistant. Mr. Lewis is on the way. When I make out with her, she will see her husband marrying another woman. Save me! I'll make you very happy. I'm here. I thought no one would save me. Silly girl, no matter where you are, I'll find you. What are you doing? Ms. Sutton, you are suspected of catching people. If you want to say something, tell us in the court. Release me. Was. . . was she caught? Yep. Don't worry. They will be in jail. No one can hurt you anymore. So, you won't marry her, right? Silly girl, I want no one but you. In the past, I was wrong. I thought of confessing later. I was afraid that you would leave me after knowing the truth. Actually, I was on the edge. But now, you know who I am. Even if you don't accept me, I will be with you and make you accept me again. From now on, I won't allow anyone to hurt you. Please don't leave me, OK?
