Alan. Surprise! Happy anniversary of your YouTube channel. It's the anniversary of when you first started making videos. Yeah! My girlfriend made me a cake for my YouTube anniversary. Guess what that means? [OMG] Alan! I took five hours to make this cake with love and you just ruined it! Stop filming me! I'm being serious, Alan. Go clean your face. Chelsea, don't be mad. She fell for it again! What is she so mad for? Whatever, I'll just clean up and take care of it. Okay. Our relationship has turned into a YouTube show. And I can't do this anymore. Make that crying face again, it'll be a good thumbnail. Seriously? Wait, what's that? I ordered it on the dark web. It's here. You want to go see what's inside? Sure. [WOW!] Wait, is this a real person? No, it's just a mannequin. Oh! Stop the music! A guy in a clown costume just attacked me and Chelsea and I think it's real. What? I thought it was a prank Stop! It's not a prank! Someone almost killed Alan just now, and we're all in danger! Guys! [I'M WATCHING YOU!] Okay, stop playing around with us, Alan! We know it's your prank! Pizza. Hey, what about the tip? It's just pizza. Smells good. [I'll kidnap one of you] Chels! Chelsea! Chels! Chels! Chelsea! [HELP ME] Why is this happening to us? [Hi !!! Do you miss her?] That's at our school. Kate? [RUN] What do you want from us?! Alan. I escaped! I'm at home. Knock on the door three times so I know it's you Let's go! Kate! You're alive! Now is not the time for jokes. You're right, let me tell you what happened. I woke up in the class, and I saw a clown taking selfies with me. Then I struck his head with a piece of wood lying next to me, and that gave me a chance to escape. And you didn't take off his mask? Wait, as I got closer to taking off his mask, someone hit me in the head, and I woke up here, all alone. And I immediately called you to come back for me. I escaped, I'm at home. Knock on the door three times so I know it's you. And I'll open the door. And immediately called you to get back for me. Listen up heroes, we have a mission. We need to find Chelsea and defeat that stupid clown. Let's do this. [INCOGNITO He wants Alan to delete his channel or I'll die. Please help me. I don't know what to do. Why is he doing this to Chelsea? I love her, but I can't delete my channel. I love my viewers. Alan, look! She's at school! Then it's settled. It's time for back to school. Let's go! [LENA] [ALAN] [KATE] [NICK] Let's go team! Let's defeat this stupid clown and save Chelsea! Wait. Where's Lena? Alan! They are everywhere! Right now, one of the clowns is holding me hostage, and if you don't delete your channel in five minutes, we will lose each other forever. Why are you doing this? Take everything from me, but not Chelsea and my YouTube channel. I'm doing this for Chelsea, love won, I'll delete my channel. Stop! Chelsea? Wait, what? What's going on here? Alan, you got too carried away with your channel. You stopped seeing the beauty around you. And you stopped noticing how you began to offend all your friends with your constant pranks and jokes that interfered with our lives. Prank! Look! Camera! Oh! You're so unhappy! You just did it over and over again. It's a prank! And it saddened us. Prank! It's a prank. Camera! It's a prank. You didn't see how your pranks hurt us. Prank! It's a prank. And we were not laughing along with you. Look at the camera! Prank! It went way too far. Beyond just pranks. We couldn't take it anymore. I pranked her! She peed her pants! We decided to scare you into deleting the channel. But not for real. To show you that there are also people close to you who love you. Wow. Thank You Chelsea, you're right. We're all real friends and you reminded me of that. By the way, I have a surprise for us. As you can see, my friends really got my back. Plus, we have news for you.
