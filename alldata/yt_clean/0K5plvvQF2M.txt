It got some little dirty stuff. Are you serious. The babies are in the vent, too. What in the world? All of them are basically in the vents. How did they get in there? Where did they come from? I think I know. How? So the reindeer was being smart, and he unscrewed the vent Okay. And all the elves went in there. And then circled around, Two and each. And then stop. And then. And then the rangers screed back on, And between, the little bars, Guys, back to what our plan was. Can't say it. Let's go do it. It's Jack! Do you see it Brandon? Dogs were barking like crazy. Do you think it's because the elves were, trying to get in the fence? What you think, Kalia? I don't know why, Let me show you where the first, Yes, come here. We have a ring camera. Right here.

Guys, they could hear you. We got to whisper. Okay, here's the two that we already have. This one. We'll see the dog, hear the dogs barking. And if that's a good sign, that means elves are probably moving. Yes, another camera. Where should we set this one up? No, no, I know. I know the perfect spot. This is Jack and Kyler No. That is Jack and Kyler. Are you serious? Jack almost to teenagers. Actually, Jack is a teenager. Put it right here. We could see this whole area. No. That's a bad idea.
