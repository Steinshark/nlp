We need help! Camera men. Step back a little! Here! Someone's here. It is now 12:00am, May 23rd. Just 4 o'clock this afternoon, a building has collapsed. Some reported that there's an explosion. People were being sent to the hospital and treated. Wendy! Wendy Moore! You can't go in now. Wendy Moore! Shawn! Where is Wendy? Shawn, please save Wendy! She's been down there for an hour. If you can't save her, she's going to die! What are you all still doing? Hurry up and save people! We have to smash open the slate. But there are two people underneath. No matter which side we hit, they will be in danger. We can't decide who lives and who dies. Who is the other person? Ruby Moore Wendy Moore I think I heard Shawn's voice. Shawn...husband... Help! There's someone there! (If Shawn Dale knew the other person) (is his wife Ruby Moore,) (what if he gives up on Wendy?) (Wendy's my daughter,) (I can't let her die.) (Ruby Moore, blame your dead mother.) (No one is protecting you.) Shawn, I don't know the other person. Please save Wendy. Wendy is dying. Don't forget that she saved your life! Save Wendy. I was married to Shawn for three years. He's still in love with Wendy Moore. But, I can't let my child die with me. Shawn, what's wrong? Wendy can wait no more! It's nothing important. Shawn, we've been married for three years. Wendy Moore! But, I'm not important to you. I still... lost... Shawn Dale's house I almost thought I will die. It's okay, Wendy. Shawn, after this experience, I don't want to wait any longer. In fact, I came back from overseas, for the promise we made ten years ago. Shawn. When will you marry me? I haven't told Ruby Moore about the divorce. Just wait some more. There's no need. Ruby Moore. Why are you like this? Shawn Dale. Stop pretending. Don't you want a divorce? Alright. I promise you. We will divorce. Ruby Moore! What are you saying? (Shawn Dale.) (If I knew it would end like this,) (I wouldn't have saved you ten years ago.) Shawn, we now can fulfill our promise. We'll be together soon. (If the hammer hadn't hit sideways,) (the child and I will be dead.) (Since God has given me another chance,) (from now on,) I, Ruby Moore, will only live for the child and myself. Push harder, harder! Miss Moore, the baby's coming out! Ms. Moore, you gave birth to quadruplets. But your second and third child, due to malnutrition, they were dead. My condolences. My children... I'm so sorry. Doctor, Ms. Moore's children are healthy. Why did you said they died? Haven't you noticed? This woman looks exactly like the woman Mr. Dale is looking for. These children may belong to Mr. Dale. If we sell them to Mr. Dale, how much do you think he will pay us? Six years later Calia Add five drops before, three drops in the middle, and two drops last. The ratio of essential oil and ethanol will be sixty to forty. Morning, CEO Moore. Morning, CEO Moore. Louis Shaw Thank you all for your hard work. As long as our Eros Perfume can be successfully developed, our company can enter Amire's market, and become the world's leading perfume brand. After this, I'll give you an extra year's salary, as a bonus. One year? I will stay in the company today. Don't stop me! (As long as there is capital,) (I can go back to Amire.) (I don't have to hide from the jerk) (Shawn Dale.) Warning. What happen? The system will be attacked in thirty seconds. Oh no, if the data is gone, our years of hard work will been in vain! Don't we have cyber security technicians? This hacker is too sneaky. He broke through the firewall and attacked our central system. He's too fast. I've done all I can. Ten. Nine. There's no time left. Eight. Did my five years of hard work Did my five years of hard work (Seven.) gone for nothing? Console me Console me Console me My dear. Be merciful! I'm coming home now. Ms. Nancy. What's up? Sorry dear. I've been working on perfume, Judy Moore I'm coming home now, ok? Don't attack the R&amp;D network. I beg you. Mommy, do you still remember us? I thought the company's your home? You forgot your two babies. You two are my sweethearts. I love you the most. That's more like it. But mommy, take care of yourself. You have one hour. Otherwise, I will continue attack the company. But... These two children. Their tempers are like the jerk Shawn Dale. It's alright, hurry home. As I see it, if you don't go home now, we don't know what will happen to the company. Louis, what would I do without you? Oh, right. Don't forget your flight to Amire tomorrow morning. Got it. See you tomorrow. Airport It's been six years. Now I'm finally back. Don't be too careless. Don't forget that Shawn Dale is still in Amire. He's been looking for you for years. Aren't you worried he found you? I'm the CEO of my company. I'm also the chief perfumer. Many people wants to work with me. Why am I afraid of him? Mommy! There's a handsome man. Judy, your craziness over handsome guys. When will you change? How handsome can he be? I'm so unlucky! What's he doing here? Did he came for you? They can't be seen by him. Louis, take them away first. I will follow after. Faster go. Mommy! Why does she look so familiar? Mr. Dale. David Ward Keep looking. Who dares touch my children? Scared me to death. I thought he had recognized me. But, he's already with his sweetheart Wendy Moore. They had children. He must've forgotten me. We're sorry. We didn't mean it. It's okay. I... We're sorry. We didn't mean it. Juno, Judy. Why are you here? Didn't you leave with Louis just now? Why are you back? You changed clothes. It's nice. I love it. Let's go and find Louis. Madam, you got the wrong person. Wrong person? I gave birth to you two. How could I be wrong? And you call me Madam? Are you acting with Judy again? I really don't know you. Okay, you're still playing an act? These two kids here. Who else could it be? If you still don't admit it, I will show photos of you two as little kids. (We never took a photo with this woman.) (But why do these two kids look like us?) (What if...) Stop with the act. Let's go and find Louis. Juno, let's go. I will take you home. (She really is our mommy.) Haven't found them yet? No. Send everyone out. If something happens to Henry and Winnie, you will get it from me. Let's go and find Louis. It's weird. We said to meet here. Where is Louis? Louis, where did you... Oh, no. If they are discovered by Shawn Dale, I can't keep them. My dears, go in and listen to me. No matter what happens, don't come out. Don't make a sound. Do you hear me? Ruby Moore, where are you running to? You got the wrong person. Ruby Moore, I will always know this face. How could I be wrong? I said you got the wrong person. If you pester me again, I'll call the police. Since you don't know me, then why did you take my children? Your children? I don't know what you're saying. You are still lying. They're in the car right now. I will know it when I see them. Shawn Dale, are you done yet? Didn't you say you don't know me? Shawn Dale, don't forget that you wanted a divorce back then. Have you ever thought seeing your ex-wife right now, if Wendy Moore knew, what would she think? Or, is Amire's powerful CEO Dale still missing his ex-wife? For the sake of your good looks, if you want to... I don't mind either. Enough! Ruby Moore, Wendy is gentle and considerate, why does she has such a shameless sister? I thought to let you meet the children. It doesn't seem necessary now. I don't care. Shawn Dale, everything about you feels sick to me. Even if you beg me to see them, I won't want to! They have the same blood as you, how can you say such a thing? Same blood? (No matter how much I hate Wendy,) (she's my sister, too.) (Wendy's children and I are still related.) Ruby Moore, as long you apologize, maybe the kids can... Stop kidding! Shawn Dale. I wish they had never been born! How could I apologize? Alright. Ruby Moore, you are so cruel. In that case, give me back the children. What are you doing? Didn't you wish they weren't born? From today onwards, you will never see them again. No! Who let you run around? Come with me! (What should we do if daddy takes us?) (We'll never see mommy again.) Mr. Dale, I found them. They're in the cafe. Pardon me? Mr. Dale, I worked for you many years. It's impossible I will see wrongly. Don't worry, I'll bring them to you now. Henry and Winnie are in the cafe? Then who are... Go away! Ruby. I lost them. It's okay, don't worry. The kids are in the car. I thought the jerk Shawn... Shawn Dale. What are you doing here? I'll tell you what. As long as I'm around, don't you dare hurt Ruby and her kids. These two children... are yours? They are mine. It's not... Exactly. The two kids in the car are ours. Their ages must be five or six years old. Ruby Moore. As soon as you left, you found another man. You are so impatient. Now you have your lover and two kids, you don't want anything else, do you? What else? Except for Juno and Judy, no one else has anything to do with me. Mr. Dale. You have time to care for my family, better go care about your children! OK. Ruby Moore, wow. Don't you regret it. What is it? Mommy. Mommy, are you alright? I'm ok. Wendy is so gentle and considerate, how can you be so shameless? Shawn Dale likes Wendy so much. They also had two children. They must be very loving. Mommy, you misunderstood daddy. They don't have children. How do you know that? Because we are... Because we are... (Daddy and mommy) (seem to be arguing fiercely.) (If she knew we were raised by daddy,) (what if she don't want us?) How do you know that? I guessed. I knew it. Who told you he is your father? He's a bad guy. You must run when you see him. OK? (Mommy really hates daddy.) (I have to find a way to get them back together.) (This way, we will have mommy!) Mommy panicked just now. There must be danger. Mommy can't take care of herself. We must protect mommy. But where is mommy? Judy, stop playing. I'm looking for mommy. Kids, I finally found you. Mr. Dale can't wait. Come back with me! What is this? We don't even know you. What are you doing? Quickly take them back! You're the bad guys who hurt mommy. Juno. We must not let go of them. Guys, let's stop playing. Let's go back, okay? If you... I invented these shoes. It has more strength than adults. This is what happens when you bully our mommy! My head! What sin did I do? What are you doing? Chase them! In your dreams! Hey, what are you doing? Why stop chasing? I am a salted fish. Salted fish? I don't deserve to live. Two grown men played by kids. You... I can't even catch a child! I'm a piece of trash! My Negative Dust is amazing. They can't catch up. Let's go find mommy. How are you getting better so soon? How could this be? How are you getting better so soon? I need skills to work under your father. Let go of me! Where is Mommy? Let me go! Who are you? Mommy where are you? Mommy where are you? Mommy where are you? As expected of Mr. Dale's kids. Mommy where are you? Catching two children is harder than being in the army. Ruby's home Finally home. We almost got caught. You two really scared me to death. I thought I almost lost you. What's wrong Judy? I'm Louis. Why is she suddenly so shy? Judy seems strange. Since she came back from the airport, she didn't say a word. Judy. What happened? Tell me. Don't you dare cry! you look like your mom, makes me want to kill you! Your mom doesn't want you. If you tell others, Shawn Dale will kick you out! You will have no one! Did you hear that? Well, it doesn't matter. I will always be with you. Judy, what's wrong? What's the matter? Tell me. Ruby. Judy seems to become mute. What? Judy seems to become mute. That's impossible. Judy spoke this morning. Why can't she speak suddenly? Judy. Can you call me Mommy? Mommy. Judy may be frightened and can't speak. Frightened? Who let you run around? Come with me! Shawn Dale is such a jerk! I'm going to find him. Ruby. Calm down. Amire is the territory of Shawn Dale. If he knew about Juno and Judy, he will come and take them away. Judy. I will find a way to help you. Juno. Take your sister to rest. Tell me if you need anything. Mommy, I will take good care of Judy. It's weird. Juno's a little devil. Why is he so obedient? It's all because of Shawn Dale. He had children with Wendy Moore. Why will he care about mine? Pardon me? He had a child with Wendy Moore? The fire that year. You were almost dead saving him. That's how he repays you? I don't want to talk about it. But if he hurts my children, I won't stand it. The banquet tomorrow, when I get the investments, I'll find Shawn Dale to settle this. Winnie, don't be afraid. I'm here. I will protect you. (I want to call Mommy,) (but I can't.) Mommy will find a way to cure you. (If mommy knew that I'm not Judy,) (and is mute,) (will she don't want me?) (I want mommy.) (I don't want to be separated from her.) Winnie, I'm the same. I want mommy too. I will find a way to make daddy and mommy together. (But here we are.) (Where's the real Judy and Juno?) Shawn Dale's house I told you. You got the wrong person. Open the door! Let us out! Henry. Winnie. Mr. Dale's coming back. You'd better stop. Damn, don't they understand? Juno, look at this! This is... We didn't take this photo before. There's even an album. Are we out of our bodies? Or are we cloned? Are you still my brother? You watched too many dramas. These two are not us. But only twins can look exactly the same. Mommy said the other two siblings are gone. Maybe they are not dead. They may be taken away by the guy that abandoned Mommy. Henry, Winnie. Mr. Dale is back. He's waiting for you in the living room. Come with me. I wanted to teach my father a lesson. I didn't expect him to come himself. Let's go meet him. Mr. Dale, I brought them here. Juno, isn't this the handsome man at the airport? He is our daddy? Don't praise him. He's the jerk who abandoned mommy. Henry Dale, Winnie Dale. You are really brave now. Dare to run away from home. You think I can't do anything. (Daddy is not good to our siblings.) (Why else would they run away?) Shawn, the children just came back. You'll scare them. Henry, Winnie. It's all my fault for being too busy. I neglected you. Fortunately, you are all right. You scared me to death! You are Wendy Moore. For this woman, you abandoned our mommy. Henry Dale, what are you saying? Did I say it wrongly? You always abandon others. Don't you want us to run away? You... How will we not want you? When I become your mommy, I will take good care of you. We are not your children. Even I know not to rob. Why do you rob other people's children? Henry, you don't need mommy. But Winnie needs mommy. Right, Winnie? Bad woman! Let go of me! You're hurting me! Winnie, what are you saying? You can talk now. (Can't the other sister talk?) Oh no, Judy's gonna be exposed. Winnie. You can talk now. Just say one more word, okay? Daddy, Winnie was hurt by that bad woman. She became agitated. Don't push her. Shawn, I was too excited just now, so... Wendy. You should know. I have no plans to remarry. Shawn, I know it's for your children. But Ruby abandoned them. I'm also very heartbroken. For their sake, even if I'm not Mrs. Dale, I'm okay with it. Shawn Dale. I wish that child was never born! (Henry and Winnie need a mother.) (But Ruby Moore) (is so heartless to abandon them.) (At least Wendy Moore is sincere.) Henry, Winnie. Do you want... No! If you like her, just have another kid. We just want our mommy. Shawn! Since the children don't like you, then don't come again. I will never forget that you saved me. Let me know if you need anything. If it weren't for these two, I have already become Mrs. Dale! Why can Winnie talk? If Shawn Dale knew I abused her, then it's over. Winnie has to be removed! We just want our mommy. Six years. They still keep thinking about their mommy. But if they knew their mother already had other children, how sad they must be. Ruby Moore is the worst! I asked you to find out about Ruby and her children's father. Did you find anything? Mr. Dale, Ms. Moore was overseas many years. There's no news. Shawn, is Ruby back? Ruby left the children behind. Now she's back. Did she want Henry and Winnie back? Impossible! A woman like her, don't deserve to be their mother! What do you want? Shawn, I need a person. Who? World's top perfumer Nancy. I heard Nancy developed a perfume called Eros. She's arrived here. She will find investors at tonight's banquet. I know Nancy. She seized the market within five years. She is quite capable. Yes, Shawn. If I could get her, my company will grow rapidly. You know my company was just getting started. If we want to invite someone like Nancy, it's hard. So I want to ask for your help. Wendy, you saved my life. As long as you need, I will do my best to help you. What about Ms. Moore? Wait until I help Wendy get Nancy, then I will settle with her. Juno. Daddy and the bad woman are gone. Mommy can't find us for so long, she must be worried. Let's go find mommy now. Never come back. Mommy is so beautiful. Mommy is the prettiest. This is my best dress. Wait until I get the investment. I'll take you to the amusement park, okay? Ruby, we should go... How is it? Seems like we will get it. Let's go, my partner. Mommy, can I come with you? Five minutes. If you don't clean up soon, then I will go. Juno, will mommy really come? I checked on the system. Mommy's going to a banquet today. She will definitely come. It's mommy's car! Ruby, you and the children go in first. Mommy! Mommy! Judy, Juno. When we enter the hall, you have to hide. You can't let the man at the airport see you. Understand? Oh no, it's daddy's car. Mommy, let's go. What's the matter? We need to wait for Louis. Mommy! Mommy! Not good, daddy's gonna see us! Shawn. Shawn, why didn't you wait for me? (These two kids look so much like Shawn.) (If he knew that,) (Juno and Judy are his children,) (then it's all over.) Juno, Judy. You go to Louis first. I will come to you afterwards. (He seems to be very happy now.) (That's better.) (I can focus on my career and raise my kids.) (I will not be held back by the past.) Fortunately, daddy didn't see us. Daddy and the bad woman went in. Will they bully mommy? Let's go in. We must protect mommy. Banquet hall I didn't expect Mr. Dale to come. Is he also here for Ms. Nancy? Shawn's not interested in perfume. I want to work with Nancy. He accompanies me. Mr. Dale and Ms. Wendy are matching. If it weren't for Mr. Dale's ex-wife, he had long been with Ms. Wendy. Don't mention her. Mr. Dale is here as support. Seems that Ms. Wendy will win Nancy over. Of course! Whoever Ms. Nancy is, I, Wendy Moore, must have her. Ruby Moore. She's the one at the main door. (It's the lame girl.) (Ruby Moore, why is she here?) Ms. Ruby. She's not here for you, is she? She said we were nothing at all. But she still came to find me. Ruby Moore you... Miss. Bailey White Just got back. Here's my card. If you don't mind, I can show you around. Of course, it's my honor to meet new friends. You're quite charming. Let me know if you need anything. I will definitely help you. Didn't you say she was looking for me? I... She's already a mother of two, yet still so fickle. So shameless. Ms. Ruby has four children. Didn't she have two with Louis Shaw? (Ruby Moore, you came to seduce Shawn.) (But if I can play you once,) (I can play you twice.) (You brought this on yourself.) It's okay Mr. White. I don't know your name yet. My name is Nan... Ruby! It's really you? Wendy Moore. I have nothing to do with you. Don't fool around here. It's because of me. I miss you so much. You can take it out on me. But don't leave without a word. Me, mom and dad are worried. She is Ruby Moore. I heard she treated Ms. Wendy as a slave. She almost killed Ms. Wendy. And she walked away without a word. She still came back. Disappeared for six years and showing up here tonight, it's not for Mr. Dale, is it? Mr. Dale and Ms. Wendy had children. And she still came? She's too shameless. Exactly. Don't say that! I don't blame her for what happened. But Ruby, you don't know much. You may not know that tonight, the top perfumer Nancy will come. Everyone is waiting to work with her. Stop your nonsense. Just go home. Don't interfere with our business. Ms. Wendy is so polite, why is her sister so shameless? They are such opposites. How can such a person attend the banquet? This is a special party for Ms. Nancy. Will she be a laughing stock here? (I'm here today to work). (If I screw up,) (all previous efforts will be in vain.) Everyone, today's banquet, you're all here for Nancy, right? To tell the truth, I am Nan... Do you want to work with Ms. Nancy too? I didn't mean to say this. Nancy is a world top perfumer. Not everyone can work with her. And she's a girl. You can't use your tricks. I now know why she dressed so brightly. Seems like she relies on men. Did she sleep with men all the way here? I say... Don't think about working with Nancy. As long you serve me well, you will have a good life. She may have slept with many, she may even have disease. You dare touch her? Someone who can sleep with Mr. Dale, why not? Let me go! You stinky b*tch. Why pretend? Come and let me kiss you. Let go of me! Mr. Dale, Bailey White is greedy and lustful. If he puts his mind on Ms. Ruby, then what? She did this to herself. What does it have to do with me? She's so troublesome. Juno, we have been looking. Where is mommy? Let me go! Look! He dares to bully mommy! Ruby Moore! That is... Don't touch my mommy! Why are those two so similar to Henry and Winnie? Could it be that... Juno, Judy. Why are you here? Didn't I tell you not to run around? We miss you. Besides, we're wearing masks. We won't let that man know. Don't worry. I won't let others bully you. Those two are Ruby's children, right? I guess I was right. Ruby, these two children are yours, right? Do you know who their father is? They are five or six years old. Before divorcing Mr. Dale, did she hook up with other men? That is disgusting. Mr. Dale has a good temper. If it's me, I'll teach this shameless woman a lesson. What did you say? Juno! Don't be rash. No need to lose your temper with this bunch. And I thought who they are. It turned out to be two little bastards. Ruby Moore, do you think these bastards can protect you? Who are you calling bastard? Was I wrong? What if I mention it? You are no longer Mr. Dale's wife. Will he still cover for you? You are nothing. I can crush these two, even you. It's as simple as crushing an ant. This guy's a bit too much. Do you want me to go over? She already has a new family. Does she need my protection? I'm just self-deluding. Ruby Moore, you dare fight me? If I get Nancy to work with me, my company can rise to the top ten. Do you know what will happen if you offend me? I don't care what happens to you. I can tolerate humilliation. But you can't insult my children! She's not irresponsible. She just doesn't like my children. You think you can get Nancy? Stop daydreaming. I suggest you look up the dictionary. Learn what is self-awareness. Ruby Moore! How dare you embarrass me? I will kill... B*tch, what did you do to me? Even if you kneel at mommy, she won't give you money either. What are you still doing? Hurry up and catch her. Before Ms. Nancy comes, I must kill her! What are you doing? B*tch. I'll let you know who you are messing with. Isn't it just three lives? Beat them! If something happens, it's on me. Let go of me! What are you doing? Let go of me! (I'm not wearing Power Sneakers.) (I ran out of anesthetics.) Let go of me! Let go of me! Daddy help! That's... Stop! What are you doing? Are you the manager? You came just in time. Get this b*tch out of here. Ms. Nancy will be here soon. She spoiled the party. Can you afford it? Kick this woman and her bastards out. She don't deserve to be here. Guards, drag them out. (Ruby Moore.) (You're kicked out in front of so many,) (let's see how you will face them in the future.) (This is what happens when you fight me.) B*tch, do you see? You are nothing here. Don't touch her. She's mine. What? You got the wrong guy. Get her! Ms. Nancy. Sorry to frighten you. It's our negligence that such people came in. We will compensate you. What did you say? She's Ms. Nancy?! You. What did you say? She's Ms. Nancy?! That's impossible. That's not possible. Drag him out! From now on, this person cannot enter our hotel. Ruby Moore. She's Nancy. How could she be Ms. Nancy? Ms. Nancy is a world top perfumer. She won many international awards. Ruby Moore is just a housewife! How could she be her? You must be mistaken. Ms. Nancy was specially invited from Calia. How could I be wrong? Didn't you introduce yourself? They're cursing me. Why am I in a hurry? It's all a misunderstanding. Ms. Nancy. Here's our card. We're looking forward to work with you. Please accept it. No need. I have already made my decision. (She knows what's best.) Ruby, sell me the perfume. I will give you a good price. Then, we sisters... You want to work with me? In your dreams. I just wanted to tell you, business is not about pleasing men. You can't make stories, and act pitifully to do it. I won't care what you did before. But I advise you to not trouble me anymore. Otherwise, don't blame me for doing this. What is she arrogant about? She's just a perfumer! So what she makes good perfume? She came here just for Mr. Dale. Pity, Mr. Dale only has eyes for Ms. Wendy. My family is not something other people can talk about. Don't let me hear what shouldn't be said. Or I won't let you survive in Amire. What the hell. Who are these people in there? Guys... Judy, Juno! Where did they go? Juno, do you want to help mommy? Do they think no one can protect mommy? I will make them pay for bullying mommy! Here goes. Juno, what does this do? You will know. Ruby Moore! Why won't you go away? Why come back? You will get it! You're against me too! What is this? What's this smell? This gas is poisonous! I'm choking! Open the door! Open the door! Who did this? Let them choke for a while. Let's get changed and find mommy. Ruby Moore. Mr. Dale, what's the matter? How much did you drink? Should I call you Ruby Moore, or Ms. Nancy? I cleaned up your mess in Amire, and now you're doing well. If I didn't attend the banquet tonight, how long are you going to lie to me? I'm irrelevant to you. Why should I tell you? Irrelevant person? Ruby Moore. Do I need to remind you? Who you are to me? Don't forget that you were my wife. Don't forget six years ago, how you provoked me, forced me to spend a night with you. If you don't remember, I don't mind helping you. Shawn Dale. What are you doing? Ruby Moore. Louis Shaw, what's so good about him? Why do you only care about his children? You ignored mine. What nonsense? Are you drunk? I don't want to talk to an alcoholic. You want to find them again. You cannot go. Ruby Moore, are you a dog? You are already with Wendy Moore. Why are you still pestering me? What do you take me for? We don't have any... Louis. There you are. Come on. Let's go home. The children are waiting. Okay, let's go home. If there's nothing else, I'm leaving. What exactly do you want? Ruby Moore. Your children is waiting for their mother. But mine has waited for six years! Shawn Dale. You chose Wendy Moore six years ago. They're your children. Nothing to do with me. If you were the one who saved me, will we be like this? Something's wrong with Shawn Dale. He kept mention the children. His kids with Wendy, what's it to do with me? If I knew he was like this, I would have him die in that fire! If I knew Shawn Dale came, I won't let you go in alone. Forget it, tonight's already messed up. (Mommy, don't be sad.) (I'm with you.) Thanks, honey. With your encouragement, I'm motivated again. Where's Juno? Is he asleep? Are you sleepy? I will take you home. I'm so embarassed! Ruby Moore! She must've find someone to do this! Who else will think up such cruel acts? Why is Ruby Moore with Winnie? I abused her for six years. And she suddenly start to resist. Turns out that she's with her mother! You ungrateful child! Don't blame me for being ruthless! Winnie is so pitiful. She can't speak. If we go to mommy now, can we still be with her? Henry and Winnie are raised by daddy. He won't let them go back to mommy. Although I miss mommy, but they never felt mommy's love. Why don't we let them stay with mommy? Alright. Mr. Dale, what's the matter? Why are you hurt? Daddy, what happen? Bitten by a dog. It looks like a human bite. Daddy, don't fool us. You speak this way? Let me apply some medicine. You're too sloppy. Let me do it. Daddy and mommy are the same. So careless. What did you say? Nothing. There you go. When did you learn this? (Oops.) (I forgot that Winnie doesn't know this.) I... Is it hard? I learn just by looking. I can do it too. Winnie is really amazing. I underestimated you. Of course! (It feels good to have a father.) (No.) (I can't feel good towards bad daddy.) I'm going to bed. Remember not to get the wound wet. Juno, someone's here! Mommy, I miss you so much. Then I'll go down by myself. Judy's always woke late. Why is she up so early today? Juno, someone's here! Judy, Judy. Henry, what happen? What's the rush? Daddy, not good! Judy is gone! What did you say? Henry, who is Judy? It's Winnie. If I hadn't slept like a log and came out with her, she wouldn't have been gone. Henry, don't worry. Daddy will save Winnie. Send everyone out. Who dares to touch the children of Shawn Dale? Yes. What's wrong, Shawn? Bad woman, did you take my sister away? Henry, don't talk nonsense. Wendy took care of you for many years. She won't hurt Winnie. Winnie is missing. Henry was agitated. What? Winnie is missing? These years, Henry and Winnie are like my own. Such a big thing happened. Why didn't you tell me sooner? Now's not the time. Our top priority is to find Winnie. Shawn, last night at the parking lot, I saw Winnie and Ruby Moore together. Do you think... Winnie met Ruby Moore? Did you meet Ruby Moore yesterday? We... (If I lied,) (what if Judy really went to find mommy?) It seems true. She said she had nothing to do with them. And now she sneaked Winnie away. Does she think I'm dead? Find me Ruby Moore's whereabouts. I'm going to ask her myself. Henry, go inside first. Boss. Keep watch over the little bastard. Don't let her get away. Don't worry boss. Can a little girl run away? Not only did I kill the little girl, I also put the blame on Ruby Moore. Ruby Moore. You offended Shawn in Amire. Just wait to die! Hospital Are you sure Ruby Moore is here? Yes, the hospital has her record of visitation half an hour ago. She should be here. (Patient 617, please come to Room 3.) Judy. We come to see the doctor. You can speak again. (Mommy, if I can talk,) (will you don't want me?) Judy, what are you saying? Why will I not want you? You are my sweetheart. No matter what you become, I won't want you. As long as you can be by my side. Grow up alongside me. (Judy Moore, please come Room 1.) Let's go see the doctor. (Mommy's sweetheart is Judy.) (If I were Judy,) (how nice that would be.) (Damn that Shawn Dale.) (I won't let him off!) Ruby Moore! Ruby Moore. It's you who took my child away. What do you mean? This is my child. Your child? You say you had nothing to do with them. Now you want her back? Too late. Shawn Dale, let her go! Shawn Dale. You made her unable to speak. How else do you want to hurt her? You! I admit that I'm incompetent. What about you? You didn't want her first! You're the one who left her. What right do you have to accuse me? What nonsense are you talking about? When did I don't want her? You love her so much that you see a child of the same age, and you think she's yours? Don't worry, I only care about my children. As for yours, I don't care. (I am not Judy.) (I am Winnie.) (The bad woman was right.) (No one wants me.) Since you don't care about her, then you won't see her again. Shawn Dale, let her go! What right did you have? I am the father of the child! Shawn Dale! This is my child. Let me pass! Judy! Shawn Dale. If I knew you were like this, even if I died in that fire, I don't want to ever know you. Winnie. That's not your mommy. (Daddy, can I still see mommy?) (If it weren't for the fire ten years ago,) (Wendy saved me,) (and I have to repay her,) (me and Ruby Moore,) (will we become like this?) Where is Judy? Henry. Don't worry, I have brought her back. You scared me to death. Bring me wherever you go. Did you hear that? Daddy, you got the wrong person. She's not Judy. How can she not be your sister? Take a good look. She is Winnie. She is also your sister. But not this sister. Which sister do you have besides her? Too late to explain. Judy is really in danger. Come with me to save her! Are you saying Ruby's kid is your sister? Daddy, if you don't save Judy, you will regret it. Enough, Henry. Let's go home. Bad daddy, I hate you! I only met Ruby Moore once, and Henry became close to her kids. Now he's so rebellious. Take good care of Winnie. Let's see how Ruby Moore influenced my children. Shawn Dale took Judy away? Did he recognize Judy as his child? Juno and Judy look so much like him. It's just a matter of time. You worked so hard to raise them. Shawn Dale's so blatant to take her away. Does he have a heart? He's in love with Wendy Moore. They even had children. He will not care for Judy. But Judy is now sick. What if no one takes care of her? What if her condition gets worse? Mommy. Actually, daddy's children are... Mommy, I'm going to open the door. It's like looking in a mirror! You are Juno right? Why are you here? Did daddy know he had four children? Now he wants to make up with mommy. No, I'm here because Judy is gone. Our bad daddy, he refused to save Judy. I had no choice but to come to mommy. Why didn't daddy save Judy? That's his child, too! Henry, you go to daddy first. Wait until I find mommy and rescue Judy. We'll change again. Why don't we just tell daddy and mommy about our existence? If daddy knew about the four of us, he will definitely take us all away. Do you want to see mommy sad? Henry, remember, don't tell daddy. What can't you tell me? Henry Dale. Shawn Dale, why are you here? Ruby Moore, it's really you. You took my daughter. And now you're contacting my son? Just admit it. You still think of them, or it's me... Shawn Dale. Shawn Dale. Where's the kid? Where did you bring Judy? You live together? Didn't you hear me? Where's the kid? I'm asking you. Are you living together? Did you forget? Louis and I have been together. Isn't it normal for us to live together? Alright. Ruby Moore, wow. A woman like you don't deserve to be my children's mother! Who wants to take care of them? This job can be done by Wendy Moore! Alright. Since you don't want to take care of them, then give them back to me now. Shawn Dale! Shawn Dale! I've been waiting. I'll be right back. Shawn Dale. Did you hear that? Your child at your house. Not in my house. Shawn Dale. You are not welcome here. Go as far as possible. Ruby Moore. I will tell Henry and Winnie that you are dead. From today onwards, you don't need to see them anymore. Do you think he is sick? Who are Henry and Winnie? What does it have to do with me? Mommy, not good! Judy is gone. Mommy, let's hurry up and save her. What? Daddy, why did you just come? I've been waiting a long time. Shawn, have you found Winnie? Where did Ruby hid her? Don't mention Ruby. (Shawn thinks Ruby took them.) (As long as they get rid of Winnie,) (Ruby Moore will surely get it.) Shawn, I took care of Winnie, she's like my own daughter. Can you talk to Ruby? She can just let it out on me. But don't hurt the child. (You cannot speak ill of my mommy.) Why are you back? Winnie's right. Mommy is the best in the world. Don't talk nonsense here. Henry Dale! Wendy, I found Winnie. Don't come here anymore. Shawn, since Winnie's back, I'm relieved. I'll go then. They can't even watch over a kid! What a bunch of trash! What is it? How did that little bastard get away? Ms. Moore, don't tease me. The kid is tied up with me. How can she run? She's tied up? The kid went home already. You are still lying. Why do I need to lie to you? I will turn on the camera for you. Isn't she right there? Where? Are you blind? Where is she? Hey, are you looking for me? What happen? Hello? What the hell is going on? Brat, didn't I tied you up? Why did you run out? Do you think these ropes can trap me? You are too naive. Is it easy being a kidnapper now? What are you talking about? Brat. I'll let you have it! Don't catch me. I'm so scared. Now you're afraid. Too late. I'll show you now. The meaning of fear! Hey! Where did she run off to? Didn't I tell you to watch her? You dare to hit me? Boss, I don't want to! Boss, my hands don't listen to me! You want to fight me, huh? Boss, it's really not me! I didn't mean it! He's pretty good. If one can't beat him, Then let's call another one. Sorry boss! Why you... You did all this! Of course, I use Puppet Powder. They can only listen to me. I don't want to hit you. I don't want to hit you. No, no! That's right. Kidnappers should be punished. Mommy taught me, we have to live upright. I will teach you bad guys a lesson! It is my duty. Beat him! No! You're sure Judy is here? Judy's watch showed her location. Let's go. Do you dare to bully children again? If there is a next time... No more. No next time. Judy! Judy! Judy! Mommy! Judy! You're talking again? That's great! Are you hurt anywhere? Mommy, I'm so scared. They tied me up. It hurts. They also threatened me, and hit me. I thought I would never see you again. I'm sorry, honey. I'm late. These beasts don't even spare a kid! Are you still human?! Your faces. Is it Judy? Ah no, no. We did it ourselves. Madam. Take this girl away. I will never do this again. I won't do it anymore. Ruby. Judy. You're okay. I'm worried to death. Just a few kidnappers. They can't beat me. I have called the police. The kidnappers have been tied up. Louis, please send them back first. I still have something to deal with. Mr. Dale. The banquet manager invited you many times. You refused. Why go this time? Henry and Winnie wants their mommy. But Ruby is so heartless. Where do I find a mother? Shawn Dale! Did you know my daughter was kidnapped? You're still standing here. Do you still have a heart? (Henry and Winnie) (wished to see their mommy.) (Yet Ruby came,) (because of me not helping her child.) Ruby Moore. You care so much about your own child. You don't care about Henry and Winnie. Then why should I care? Even if your child was kidnapped, or even killed, it has nothing to do with me. Shawn Dale, you bastard! Ruby Moore. Don't think my children likes you, then you can do whatever you want. (He and Wendy's children like me?) Ruby Moore. If you come make trouble again, I don't mind letting you and your lover get lost. I'm stupid. Six years ago, he abandoned me for Wendy. Now for Wendy's children, he abandoned Judy and Juno. I also didn't intend for Judy and Juno to know a heartless father. Ruby's house Let us accompany mommy for a few more days. It's okay, Juno. Thank you. You know what? Mommy said I'm the eldest. Pay me some respect. Alright. Good, I will protect you too. We will definitely be reunited. Judy, Juno. Pack up your things. We're leaving tomorrow. What? Ruby, what is it? Why leave Amire in a hurry? Judy has been kidnapped once. And I still don't know who's behind it. This is Shawn Dale's territory. It's not safe at all. I can give up anything. But Juno and Judy... I will never allow them to be hurt again. Louis. I promised you before. To make a name in Amire. I'm afraid I can't now. What are you talking about? I saw them growing up too. I don't want anything happen to them either. It's okay, let's just start over. Then I'm going to book the tickets. Pack your things soon. We leave tomorrow. What can we do? If mommy leaves Amire, we'll never see each other again. It must be daddy. Mommy will leave when she saw him. I don't want mommy to go either. Now what? It's hard to talk here. Let's meet and discuss it. Get dressed. Let's go! (They have been on the phone lately.) (But we only just came here.) (Who would they be calling?) (They won't be deceived, will they?) Mommy, can we go out? Okay, remember to turn on your watch. Keep me updated, alright? Got it. The boss of the kidnapping hadn't been found. Another one has come. I'd like to know who is behind this. Who is plotting against my children? Mr. Dale. Winnie is gone again. Pardon me? Henry left this behind. Take a look. They're just two kids. Who can they meet? Find out. Ok. I felt like someone's following us. It's okay, let's find Henry and Winnie. Then we deal with them together. Okay, here goes! The mall? Who are they meeting? Mr. Dale. The two children were last seen in this mall. Split up and find them. Yes. She looks so much like that woman. Don't touch me, I'm busy. Ruby Moore. It really is you! It really is you. Shawn Dale, I don't have time for you. I should have known. Someone who can meet Henry and Winnie. Who else but you? Shawn Dale, if you are sick, go to the doctor. How many times have I said? I'm not interested in your children. Go away! If you're not here for them, then why are you dressed like that? And you're here in the mall where they disappeared. Ruby Moore, do you think I'm stupid? Shawn Dale. Don't be self-deluding. Henry and Winnie are your sweethearts. But they are nothing to me. Ruby Moore, you dare to say that? You're so protective of her children. I can't even say anything. Of course I protect my own. Do I still count on you? Stop kidding. I came to the mall to find my children. Ruby Moore, you really care about those two. Otherwise, do I count on you? Ruby Moore, I will believe you again. You better pray that you had nothing to do their disappearance. Or else... You know the consequences. Bastard! I won't care about this jerk! I need to find Judy and Juno. His own children ran off and he blames others. My children are better than yours. They were here just now. Why are they missing? Mr. Dale. The two children left the mall. My men is now after them. You knocked someone out with a stick. Winnie, you are amazing! Of course! She's my sister. She's amazing. Now you know how good we are. See if you still dare to bully children. Wait. Something's wrong. See who dares to touch my children. It's mommy! She's really is. Call the ambulance! Mommy must have been worried. It's all my fault. Mommy. (Because of me.) (I hit mommy.) (Will mommy never wake up?) No, mommy will wake up. Why are you crying like this? You're like a kitten. I'm sorry, I thought you're the bad guy. Why will I be angry? Judy has a good sense of danger. I am happy. if you are in danger next time, be sure to tell me as soon as possible. Do you understand? Yes, mommy. (Mommy, I'm sorry.) Judy, what's wrong? Why can't you speak again? Judy. Why are there two of you? Why are there two Judys? Doctor! Juno, Judy. Please help mommy call the doctor. My brain is having some problem. Mommy, your brain is fine. You saw that correctly. Mommy, I'm Henry Dale. She's Winnie Dale. Henry Dale, Winnie Dale. You are named Dale. Then Shawn Dale... He's our daddy. The children he kept talking about. It's you two? Ms. Moore, you gave birth to quadruplets. But, due to malnutrition, two of them are dead. (The doctor said that the two were dead.) (But they were taken away by Shawn Dale,) (and grew up safely?) (What the hell is going on?) (I'm sorry, mommy.) (I hurt you.) (I know you don't like me.) (I will leave now.) Winnie! Winnie. You are my child. How could I not like you? (But someone said you don't want us.) (They said we don't have a mommy.) They're talking nonsense! I thought you two... I'm sorry, my dear. I will never leave you again. (Would you dislike me for being a mute?) How come? You are my child. No matter what you become, I won't dislike you. Mommy... Winnie? You can speak. That's great! Winnie, I'm here. I'm always here. (I haven't figured it out yet.) (Why are the children with Shawn Dale?) (But no matter what,) (I want to stay) (and make up for Henry and Winnie.) Ruby Moore. Go! Ruby Moore. Shawn Dale, why are you here? Why are Henry and Winnie's location shown here? Don't tell me it's a coincidence. How should I know? Is it? You can't go there. It's not up to you to decide. Shawn Dale! You can't go there! (Oh, no.) (If they were seen, I can't keep them.) Winnie. Daddy, we want to come here. You can't hurt mommy. Bring them away first. No, Henry, Winnie! Shawn Dale. They are my children. You can't take them. Your children? Didn't you wish they weren't born? Who is it that said anything that concerns me is disgusting? Ruby Moore. You were the one who abandoned them. And now you're acting like a loving mother. Who is it for? No. No, it's not like that. I didn't know that. Shawn, I beg you not to take them away. As long as you let them stay by my side, I can do whatever you want. No need. My children, even without a mother, I can also take good care of them. No! Ruby! Shawn Dale. You think she's not hurt enough? I'll tell you what. As long as I'm here, don't think of hurting her. Is it? You just said you can do anything. As long as you them stay by my side, I will do anything. Then I want you to live in my house. Be a nanny for Henry and Winnie. Shawn Dale. Are you crazy? She's now the world's top perfumer. Asking her to babysit your children? In your dreams. I'm willing. What? Without my permission, you are not allowed to leave. You can't meet people I don't like. Shawn Dale, don't go too far. Okay. I promise you. Ruby, what happened? No time to explain. Take care of Juno and Judy for me. What are you doing? Before I regret it, get changed. Shawn Dale, Winnie's become like this. What's going on? Winnie seldom talked since young. Until one day, she couldn't say a word anymore. I will definitely find a way to cure her. You care so much about her. Ruby Moore, do you care more about my children, or Louis Shaw's? (What kind of question is this?) (Aren't these four children all his?) I don't expect you to care more about Henry and Winnie. Shawn, I heard that Henry and Winnie ran away again. Could it be Ruby again? That's her own children. How could she do it? I'd like to know, what did I do to them? Ruby Moore! What are you doing here? My children is here. Why can't I come? Ruby, you may not know, Henry and Winnie don't like strangers. Although you are their mommy, but you abandoned them before. Many years passed. I'm afraid they won't accept you. Mommy! Mommy, are you here to see us? Mommy, I'm afraid. Can you not go? I'm not leaving. I am never leaving. Mommy, come in, You are still injured. You need to rest. Come. (Ungrateful children!) (No, if she lives in the house,) (and hook up with Shawn again,) (when can I become Mrs. Dale?) Shawn. Shawn, can I stay too? After all, Henry and Winnie were taken care by me since young. Since they were born, Ruby never cared for them. I'm a little worried. Suit yourself. Shawn's cold to me. Ruby Moore, damn you! I won't let you off. Since she entered the children's room, Ruby never came out. They only met her few times, why can they be so close? (The cookies I baked for mommy are ready.) (These biscuits,) (they must be delicious.) Winnie. You make the best cookies. Give me a taste. You ungrateful child. Have you forgotten what I taught you? Didn't I tell you not to disobey me? You need to be taught a lesson. Winnie, do you know that? I like you the most. Because you're mute. No matter how much I hit you, you can't speak! I'll tell you what. Your mom's a b*tch. You are also a b*tch! You're born to let me vent my anger. Winnie Dale, don't think you can escape! (Mommy!) Juno, if we sneak in to find mommy. will we be discovered? What are you afraid of? We look exactly like Henry and Winnie. Even if found out, they will think that we are them. Juno, did you hear someone crying? I heard, let's go and have a look. Stop! Stop! Henry, why are you here? Stop meddling! Or I will beat you too! Juno, this bad woman bullies Winnie. We must not let her off. Winnie? What is this? Why are there two of you? Bad woman, you should worry about yourself. Brat, what are you doing? Bad woman, you deserve it! Winnie, are you alright? You still say you're okay? Where's mommy? I'm going to tell mommy. (She saved daddy's life.) (Daddy won't hurt her.) (I don't want to trouble mommy.) (Please don't tell mommy.) Are we just going to let her go? Don't worry, this powder is my latest product. It's powerful. You'll see. Find mommy. Let's go find mommy. Like this? Yeah, that's it. Mommy is so smart. How can any child praise mommy? Mommy. Juno, Judy. Why are you here? I miss my mommy. Mommy. Winnie has something for you. You know how to make cookies? Winnie is awesome. I love you all. You are all my sweethearts. Mr. Dale. You came here as soon you're back. Is it to see the children, or Ms. Ruby? If it weren't for the fire, without the kindness I owe Wendy, these four children won't suffer so much. Wait. Four children? Daddy! Mr. Dale, it's late. Can I help you? The kids are going to bed. It's nothing. Mr. Dale, anything else? How's your head? It's recovering. Let me know if you need anything. I'm always here. Daddy is good to mommy. Our family reunion is just around the corner. Say... If there are only two people, but I saw four. What's going on here? Maybe your eyesight's not good. Or you've seen ghosts. Ghosts? You're too superstitious. There's no ghosts in this world... Did you see that? What? I must be imagining things. Taking care of four children at once is quite tiring. But I'm happy. Shawn Dale, you... Keep your voice down. The children are asleep. Shawn Dale, what do you want? I didn't prepare a room for you. Just sleep in my room. No need, I'll just go to the kids' room. Shawn Dale. Mr. Dale. What exactly do you want? Ruby Moore, don't forget your status. You are our nanny. You must listen to me. Fine. Then I don't live here. I'll sleep outdoors, okay? Just go, I don't need you anyway. What are you... Please. Don't leave me alone these days. I really owe you in my past life. You can't come up. Where will I sleep? You... Just sleep there. Goodnight. I won't leave you. We will escape soon. Little girl, the fire is coming. Just go! Or you will die too! Ruby Moore My father and stepmother dislike me. They always bring my sister but not me. It's terrifying being alone. So I will never leave you alone. I will marry you, and you'll never be alone. (If the girl who saved me was you,) (how nice it would be.) (Shawn Dale.) (Back then, you chose Wendy Moore over me.) (Why are you tangling with me now?) Why do I feel like I saw two Winnies? I must be dreaming. Why does my face hurt so much? Winnie, did you hear that? (It must be mommy!) Winnie, you little b*tch. You did this! I'll kill you! Wendy Moore! How dare you touch my child? Ruby Moore. You told her to do this! Now my face looks like this. Are you satisfied? (Winnie don't know this.) (It must be Judy's doing.) Wendy Moore. My child will not hurt others purposely. Unless you did something to her. What did I do to her? Go ask her. Yes, I forgot. She's just a mute. She can't speak. You caused her sickness. How would I know that? Why don't you find another child? Maybe they won't speak after you hit them. Wendy Moore, she's just a child! How could you do that? Why not? Ruby Moore, you're just a b*tch! You are worthless in our family. Then you became Mrs. Dale. I'm going to steal your husband, hit your children. You and your children are worthless! Wendy Moore, how dare you! Ruby Moore! What are you doing? Wendy Moore, how dare you! Ruby Moore, what are you doing? Shawn. Winnie did this to me. I just wanted to ask her why. I didn't expect Ruby to... Shawn. I know Winnie is a very kind child. She accidentally hurt me. She certainly didn't mean it. You must not misunderstand her. Ruby Moore, did you told her to do this? Haven't you hurt Wendy enough? Why can't you just let her go? I knew it! It's still the same. Pardon me? Shawn Dale. You believe her so much? No wonder Winnie was bullied for so long. She didn't tell you. You and Wendy Moore are in it together. Winnie was bullied? What do you mean? Wendy Moore admitted it herself. She bullied Winnie for many years. Shawn Dale. You really don't know, or are you deliberately protecting her? Shawn. The way I treated them these years, you've seen it. I regarded them as my children. Ruby. I know you are jealous. But you can't teach a child to hurt someone. Just vent your anger on me. Don't hurt the children. She's innocent! Ruby Moore, you were away for six years. Wendy took care of them for six years. She hasn't complained a word. Why can't you just let it go? Get along well with her. Shawn Dale. You can get along abusers. I can't. Okay. Since you believe in her, then I'll take the kids away. Where are you going? Ruby Moore, what do you take my house for? You come as you wish. And go as you wish? Shawn Dale, even if I die today, I will also take them away. People like you, don't deserve to be their father! I don't deserve? Does Louis Shaw deserve to be? You want my children to call him daddy? Don't even think about it. Bring Henry and Winnie back. Yes. Let them go! Shawn Dale! What do you want? Since you can't take care of them, there's no need for you to be here. Kick her out! Without my permission, don't let her come back. Yes. No! Let go of me! (If I go,) (Winnie and Henry) (will be bullied.) (No, I can't go.) Shawn Dale, I'm sorry. I was wrong. I shouldn't have said to take them away. I won't do it anymore. I will stay here and teach them well. Can you let me stay here? Daddy please, don't push mommy away. Shawn. From today onwards, take care of them well. Stop playing tricks. Shawn. Wendy, I will find a doctor to see your face. This is the end. Don't mention it again. Ruby Moore. I won't let you off. Henry, Winnie. Are you all right? (Mommy, I'm sorry.) (It's all because of me.) Mommy, it's my fault. I saw the bad woman bullying Winnie. I taught her a lesson. I won't be so rash next time. You did the right thing. You have to protect yourself. It's me who's sorry. It's me. I didn't protect you well. (I must become stronger.) (And protect mommy.) (I will find a way to become stronger.) (And protect my children.) CEO, Dale Group wants to work with us. About that project, you... (Daddy's company?) (No, if I work with daddy,) (he will find out that) (I'm the CEO of Stellar.) I refuse, we cannot work with Dale Group on this project. Yes. Mr. Dale, the house's surveillance were tampered with. I've sent someone to find out. Why did you suddenly want to see it? Wendy admitted it herself. She bullied Winnie for many years. I just want to know the truth. By the way, how is Stellar Group? Stellar Group rejected our offer. This company only started for a year. We don't know who is the man behind. Such bravery! Only for a year, and they already became top two in Amire. The person behind it can't be underestimated. But the project is important. I can get it. You? Shawn Dale. I help you get this project. Can you invest in my company? Ruby Moore, you only took care of them two days. It doesn't conflict with the company. (If I got the money,) (I can take them away.) (Then I can negotiate with Shawn Dale.) And? And... I'm still their mom. And I'm your ex-wife. You don't want your children's mom to be incapable, right? You don't want your children's mom to be incapable, right? If you don't agree, forget it. Why are you so fierce? I'll think of another way. Okay. But before I know what you're capable of, you can't negotiate using Dale Group's name. If you want to get my coorperation, and my investment, you have to prove your worth. Can you do that? Alright. It's a deal. Ruby Moore, I heard that. Don't think I don't know what you're thinking. You want Shawn Dale's investment? You just want to seduce him. Let him continue to be with you! I'll tell you what. Stop dreaming. Shawn loves me. If it weren't for those little brats, he won't even look at you. If Shawn Dale really liked you, it's been six years. Why hasn't he married you yet? That's because he respects me. He wants the best for me. If that's the case, then I'll wait your wedding invitations. At your wedding day, I will pack a big gift for you. If there is such a day. B*tch, you're the woman Shawn didn't want! Still so arrogant! Ruby Moore, I won't let you succeed. Bailey He's annoying as a fly! Ms. Wendy. You finally answered my call. At the banquet, I spoke for you. And I'm beaten down by Dale Group. Now I'm on the verge of bankruptcy. I beg you. Please help me. Now's a chance for you. But, do you have what it takes? (I have emailed the project proposal) (to Stellar Group.) (I hope they will be interested.) (Please give me a chance to talk about it.) (This company's proposal is quite interesting.) Mommy. Why haven't you sleep? What are you looking at? You startled me. Henry, why are you still awake? I went to the toilet. Mommy, don't keep working. You need to rest. Okay, go ahead. No reply from Stellar Group. How can I sleep? Eros Perfume's proposal is quite good. Ask their boss to meet me tomorrow. Yes. They agreed. They agreed! Awesome! Mommy. Henry. Awesome, they agreed! After I get the investment, I can better protect you. (Mommy wants cooperation?) (I'm good at negotiating.) (I can finally help mommy.) Mommy, can you take me with you? Henry, this is very important to me. Don't worry. I will never make trouble. Maybe I can help you. Mommy, please take me there. OK. (I don't know who is meeting mommy.) (If they dare to bully mommy,) (I will ask Secretary Lynn to take them down.) Stellar Group (It's my company!) (Is it...) Mommy, is your company Eros Perfume? How do you know that? Because I am... Ruby Moore! Ruby Moore. What the hell are you doing here? Bailey White, haven't you learned your lesson? What are you doing here? If not for you, how could I be sidelined, on the verge of bankruptcy? I'm now in this situation. You came to laugh at me. Or did you hear that Stellar Group's CEO is coming, and you came for him? Mr. White. I'm here today to work with Stellar Group. I don't have time to talk. Ms. Moore, you are daydreaming. Stellar Group is a leading company here. Dale Group can't even win them over. How could they possibly work with a small company like yours? In your dreams. It's all about benefit and sincerity, rather than the size of the company. You're right. Someone like you who tries to catch the CEO's attention won't understand. I beg your pardon? What are you doing? What do you take our company for? Hey. You misunderstood me. Receptionist at the front door. I'm just helping you teach her a lesson. Hey. I heard that the CEO is coming. Can you let me meet him? The CEO of our company is not someone you can simply meet. Get out. I'm waiting for Ms. Moore. (Ms. Moore?) (Did Wendy Moore arranged it for me?) Hello, I'm... I am the one Ms. Moore sent to discuss working with your company. What nonsense are you talking about? Have you heard of Wendy Moore? Not only is she Mr. Dale's sweetheart, she's also Moore Group's CEO. And she's only a liar with bastards. You cannot be deceived. Nonsense, my mommy is not a liar. She's the one Stellar Group wants to work with. Bailey White, who you calling a bastard? What about it? Who doesn't know you had children behind Mr. Dale's back? He doesn't even know his father, isn't he a bastard? Oh, right. I spent some time at Calia before. Weren't you from there? Maybe he's mine? Shut up! Woman. You look pretty. Why are you so vulgar? People like you in front of our door. It's humilliating. I advise you to get out of here. I think you misunderstood. I'm the one working with Stellar Group. See for yourself. This is the information I prepared for today. I don't have time to listen to you. This is Stellar Group. Not your playground! I advise you, get out! Or I'll call security. (The proposal's destroyed.) (Am I done for?) Mommy, are you alright? Aren't you afraid the CEO will blame you? Kid. Our CEO is very busy. He don't have time for this. I'll take care of it. I am the CEO of Stellar Group. This kid. He's just a bastard. He has no common sense. You're the CEO? Kid, you hadn't even stop drinking milk! Is this a kindergarten? Take your child away quickly. Don't embarrass yourself here. You! Mommy, I'm really the CEO. Henry. I know you're trying to protect me. But that's between adults. Let us adults handle it, okay? But... Enough, stop acting loving here. Ruby Moore, since you are gentle with children, just go home and be a housewife. You're just a woman. What business you have here? You're useless. If you don't let me in today, Then I will find the CEO myself. You asked for it. You're worthless! You want to meet the CEO? I'm alright. Guards! Bring them out! The CEO is coming, don't let him see them! Let go of me! Let go of my mommy! Henry! Let me go! Let go of my mommy! Let go of me! Let go of my mommy! Who dares to make trouble here? You don't know the CEO is coming? What will he say? Mr. Lynn. I came out to meet the partner. But, I saw this vulgar mother and son. I'll kick them out right now. Bring them out immediately! Who gave you the right? You're disrespectful to the CEO! CEO, I'm sorry. I didn't manage the staff well. You are startled. Mr. Lynn. He's a little brat. How could he be the CEO? I was personally elected by CEO. Of course I know who the CEO is. (Henry really is Stellar Group's CEO?) (The CEO of Stellar Group is my son?!) My mom came here. I don't want to see any wicked person. Understood. I'll clean them out. You're fired. CEO, please give me another chance. I'm still drinking milk. How can I help you? Mommy, let me show you your company. My company? My company is your company. Come on. CEO. CEO. I was sent by White Group. This is my only chance. Please talk to me, CEO. That's impossible. CEO. Just give me a chance. I will definitely satisfy you. Dream on. CEO! CEO. It's done. I f*cked up. All screwed up! Stellar Group's CEO is actually Henry Dale?! Why does she have such an outstanding child? Even God helps her. Ruby Moore. If you're dead, it will all be mine. Bailey White. I need you to do one more thing for me. As long as you succeed, I will give you what you want. Mommy, go back first. I have something else to do. Okay, don't get too tired. Faster come home. Mommy, don't touch my head outside. Many people are watching. Got it. (It feels good to have a mommy.) My son is amazing. What are you doing? We're restoring the surveillance footage. The woman bullying mommy and Winnie must pay the price. (Where's mommy?) Mommy has already come home. No, mommy never came back. She's not answering the phone. Did something happen to mommy? Daddy! Something's happen to mommy! What did you say? Daddy, let's save mommy! She's in danger. (It must have been the bad woman.) (Daddy, go save mommy!) Are you saying the bad woman is Wendy Moore? Hello? Shawn. What's up? Wendy, do you know where Ruby is? Yes. I heard. Ruby and her boyfriend were traveling with their kids. Shawn. Ruby just wants her own happiness. Don't blame her. She promised to be with the kids. Now she snuck away! Daddy, how is mommy? Let's go and save her. Save her? She's happy right now! We don't need to save her. It's getting late. Take Winnie to bed first. She is really in danger. Why don't you believe it? If something happens to mommy, we will never forgive you. If you don't, we will go by ourselves. Stop right there! How many times should I said this? Your mommy's not missing. She left. She's never coming back. No way. She won't leave without us. Why not? She's already with someone else. She had other children with that man. She doesn't want us. Do you understand? Are you looking for us? Are you looking for us? I didn't see wrongly. There are really four children. What the hell is going on? Actually we are quadruplets. Judy and I grew up beside mommy. Mommy thought Winnie and Henry were gone. We only knew when we came here. Quadruplets. Then Louis Shaw... Louis is just a good friend. Mommy lied because she was afraid you would take us away. So it is. Daddy, mommy won't leave us. The bad woman must be lying. Hurry up and take us to mommy. But why did Wendy Moore do this? Is there any misunderstanding? The bad woman is quite good. You believe her so much? What is that woman like? You can see for yourself. You won't speak even if I hit you! So what Ruby said is true. Winnie, why didn't you tell me sooner? (The bad woman said if I told you,) (she will tell you to throw us away.) (We will become unwanted children.) Nonsense. You are everything to me. How could I not want you? Wendy Moore, how dare she? (Daddy, I want mommy.) (Can you go and save mommy?) Winnie. Don't worry. I will save mommy. That's better. Ruby Moore. You're not fit to be glamorous. You don't deserve anything! Wendy Moore. Aren't you afraid you will be found out? Found out? I used your phone to buy plane tickets. A person who died abroad. What does it have to do with me? After you die, Shawn, and those brats, will be all mine. I will play with them however I like. Wendy Moore, if you dare touch my children, I will haunt you! I'd like to see how you do it. Ruby Moore, you want to fight me? You are still lacking. This is the result. Ruby. Goodbye. Ms. Moore. What's up? This b*tch caused my company to bankrupt. Just letting her die, that's too easy. Can you give her to me before that? You are still thinking about that? No wonder you can't be successful. But, to let her have it before dying, should be good. Hurry up. Don't delay our deeds. Alright. B*tch. You're finally in my hands. This time, who else can save you? Go away! Don't touch me! Ruby. There is no one here. You will die anyway. Why not have some fun? Help! Help! Idiot. Ruby! Mommy! Winnie! You... (Mommy, I'm just a little stronger.) (I'm not a monster.) (Don't be afraid of me.) You're not a monster. You're the hero who saved me. Winnie, you are amazing. Luckily you saved mommy. Of course! She's my sister. She's amazing. We should not make her angry. You already know about them? Shawn Dale, I am their mommy. I will not let you take them away. The doctor told me you abandoned them. I bought them at a high price. I thought you were irresponsible. But... Abandon them? Shawn Dale, am I that way in your eyes? Am I someone that abandons children? Then why did you leave without a word? Isn't it because of you? Sixteen years ago, that fire, you said you wanted to marry me. You said you wouldn't leave me alone. But when the building collapsed, you left me alone in the ruins. You saved Wendy Moore. You broke our promise. It's you who don't want me. When the building collapsed, I didn't know you were... Wait, what are you saying about the fire sixteen years ago? So you have forgotten. Never mind. This never happened. From now on... You were the girl who saved me from the fire. Who else? But didn't you say you're the younger? According to the time born, I am indeed the younger sibling. But my parents asked me to let her be the younger sister. I became the elder sibling. I see. For sixteen years, I believed her. I thought she was you. You thought Wendy Moore saved you? You know what? For many years, I hoped many times that it was you. I didn't expect it to be true. Ruby. I'm sorry. The way you hurt me, and you think it's over? And... now's not the time. It's not over yet. I can protect them. I sent someone to find a lawyer. I will let that bad woman be jailed forever. I have Truth Powder here. They will surely tell the truth. The kids are amazing. I feel like I could retire early. No matter what, I admit that your genes are good. No matter what, I think it's worth talking about. About what? Am I really that small-sized? Do I need to see the doctor? Why are you so vengeful? Shawn Dale. Put me down. The End
