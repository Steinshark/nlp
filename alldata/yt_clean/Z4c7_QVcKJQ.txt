Wick is a step ahead of you. He actually took the things with him from last strip. - Oh, fair enough. I got salopettes. - No, we want ski pants. - Okay. - What about one of those onesies? - I wouldn't be opposed to a onesie. You know? - Ready for this? I'll give you a little. I look the same.

We've got a traffic cone coming with us into the wilderness. [Vik laughing] We won't lose you, will we? We'll know exactly where you are. - I can't believe I'm [everyone laughing] - Yes, me and Bez are suited and booted. We're in our warm clothes. We are heading down the highway. But we are unsure to where. [upbeat music] Look at that. Beautiful. - We're climbing that? Nice. Let's go. - Yeah, let's go do some climbing! We have some news. So these are yours now. - Oh, no. - We are gonna head to - Get that away from me. - And from now on, you don't have a driver with you anymore. The super Jeeps we have outside? - Yes. - Yeah, you're driving them. - Okay. All right. - I'm gonna let you in on a little bit of the plan. In logistics, our plan is to try to reach the top of the Langjokull glacier and set camp there. This is [indistinct]. He owns the cars. So he's gonna tell you and then just try to keep up. - Okay. - They have a bum gun here? - Do it. Do it. Don't you dare. [Tobi laughing] - You best walk away before I get you. - I'm not dirty. I'm not dirty. - Oh, we've got a mini-bar. - There's a fridge in the desert. - We've got Pringles. - There's apple juice, lads. - This is nuts. I mean, compared to what they're gonna be camping, I feel like this is a bit of a step up. - I wanna see them men in an igloo. - They're camping-camping, we're glamping. - I want to see them suffer. - I want them fishing - I will say, boys, as soon as I found out we were driving, I was quickly like, &quot;Oh, yeah, Ethan, I'll go with you.&quot; The thought of being with JJ or Vik in a car right now horrifies me, or me driving horrifies me. You are, despite being a bit of a cracker, the only person I trust to drive a car. - Oh, boy. - f*cking hell, bruv. - By the way, look how far over Ethan is. He doesn't know what side of the road- Tell him on the walkie-talkie. - Bro, you are so far on the right side of the road! - He doesn't know. He doesn't know that he's on the other side of the car. [cinematic music] Oh, he's playing &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; - That'll do. [Ethan laughing] Thought that fit the vibe pretty well. - I reckon that come - Sorry for that if it came through horribly. - No, no, it was really cool. It's just a shame that Ethan can't drive. [Ethan and Harry laughing] - Oh, that looks- I'm not doing that. - You lot is mad 'cause I'm not getting up from here. - Come, come. - Need a hand? Grab that one. - You can have the shoes. No! - Now what do we do with them? - We place them just out of reach. If you want them you have to go into the sand. - You are evil. - I reckon, from there you could long jump into them. - No. - Yeah, go on. You can. - That was crazy! - It was close. - Just give me a rating. - No rating. - I need help! [upbeat music] - Bro, you got this. Come on, man. - Light work. Round the roundabout. - Oh, Ethan, I'm not sure about that timing, mate. - I did exactly what f*cking Anton did. I did exactly what Anton did, you f*cking freak! - You didn't even f*cking - Anton didn't! [KSI and Vik laughing] - You're under his skin. - Yes. Ayo, if Anton jumped off a cliff, would you? - Yes! Anton is king! I think he's getting [Ethan laughing] - Vik, you're holding - You're being tailgated, boss. - He's getting pissed. He's getting pissed. - Yeah, well, f*ck him. Where's this brother gonna go, huh? Is he gonna go off-road? If he really wants to overtake us, then do it, innit? You need to focus on your driving, mate. [Ethan laughing] - You're telling me the sun rises from the other side of that? - Yeah. - Should we see the view? - Yes, please. Oh, that really hurt! [Simon panting] - Come back. I've got Tobi's camera. - That looks like a workout. How is he only that far up? - He's gonna maxed. You're gonna regret it all. - That looks like a workout. - Oh, yeah, we're going up. - Lads? - Yeah. - There was about 10 gazelle. - And you scared them off. - I scared them. - f*ck. - Oh, he's indicating this time. Good lad. - Oh, he's indicating. Aw! - Anton did. - Oh, there he is! [everyone laughing] Top marks, Ethan. Top marks. - Thanks, boss. - This is the last until sometime tomorrow.

Duct tape? - One of us is dying. - Oh! This is essential. - I have a feeling toilet Do we want kitchen roll, or is that gonna cut your bum up? - I think it's a bit too much. - Bit too much? - Yeah, this is the last toilet you'll see. - It's the last toilet we'll-? - Until you actually have - I mean, I'm used to - Look, there's three over there. - Guys, this hurts. - So there is our camp. We're staying overnight down there. - I regret that. - I think we're going over there somewhere in a bit to do some activities. Are you struggling? - I can't make it up the hill. I feel like that scene in &quot;The Lion King.&quot; Please, please! Simon, please! - Long live the king! - Long live the king! [Tobi and Simon struggling] - Are these the shovels - Well, I think they're good enough. - Okay. Okay. You are shovelling. That's okay. No problem. - Wait, do we need firewood? - Well, it depends how you want your food. Cold or hot. - Oh, my God. Guys, what are we doing? Are we even buying what we need to buy? - Wanna find something We make a fire later. It's rabbit, bro. We can't have bacon. All right. I'm gonna take a salmon, man. I'm gonna cook salmon for dinner. - God dammit. This guy. Vik, you left the car on. - Huh? - You left the car on. - Oh, sh*t. - Is this guy okay? Brother? First of all, no firewood. And you're like, &quot;Oh, yeah, we probably need that.&quot; And then the car you just left. - We're ready to go now. [cheerful music] - Oh, we are f*cked, man. - I'm in that one. And Simon and Tobi are - Gazelle droppings. - Did you just put it in your mouth? - They're fresh. - Is that a grave? - Let's go check it out. - Oh, I've got sand all in my shoe. - This could be a grave. - What is that? - The desert's first victim. Thou who pulls out said pipe, shall receive hepatitis. - Thot walk. Eyy, eyy! Do the thot walk. [cheerful music] - And the camels slowly make their way down the- - There's so much sand in my shoe. Tobi's gonna catch me in the morning just f*cking... - Just realised. You know why I forgot to turn the car off? - Why? - Because I'm so used to my Tesla. - Oh, my God. - You don't turn it off. It's electric. You just press park and get out of the car. - And it just turns off for you. - No. There's no engine. There's zero engine in the car. - Must be nice. - What the f*ck? You said that like you couldn't get one. - Ayo, shut up, man. - Must be nice. [KSI laughing] Oh, I wish. f*cking hell. - Yeah, we just put the b*tch in four-wheel drive. Come on. Turned it. All four-wheels in action. - Ayo, we're really going out into the white abyss. That's where we're going, on the left. - What? Just that white? - Yeah. There's gonna be nothing else but just a flat white sheet. - Bro, I'm gonna stand out so much. - I'd pay good money to see Vik just slide off the road. [Harry and Ethan laughing] - You say that, but it'd probably be [indistinct]. I'll accelerate at the corner. - You know what? I'll take either. I'll take either. A bit of fun all around. - Picture at the bar. Malibu. What you got? - Lemonade. - Lemonade in Malibu, bro. - He's got lemonade. - Who wants to start? - Him. - You'll start? - Sure. - So you'll have the of checking that it's [crosstalk] There's a couple of jokers. And if you count me, there's three. [Josh laughing] - I was gonna say that about you. - Do you wanna shuffle them? - Yes. - You can shuffle it. - I can't do that. - Pick a card, any card. - It's a solid card. - I should have done this. - Don't tell me what it is. In the middle of the pack. I'll do it like that over the table so you can see as well. And we're gonna lose it like this. You can tell me what the card is. For this trick you have to tell me. - It's the 8 of hearts. - 8 of hearts? We're gonna do this. We're gonna do one, two, and three. And now the 8 of hearts has flipped in the pack. - What? - See, there will be one card, and one card only. - That's the secret. - It'd be a pretty bad - &quot;Oh, yeah, that's how you do it.&quot; [animals screeching] - I can't believe this for the coldest cinematic we've taken in Sidemen history. I can't believe it. [animals screeching] [KSI laughing] [upbeat music] - Oh, sh*t. We're off-road. - I've indicated for no reason. Why have I indicated? - Oh, wow. Look at these. - Ah, here we go. This is the sh*t. - If you don't feel confident doing this, don't you worry, Ethan. I can drive. [upbeat music] - You know it's serious when the Icelandics are driving slowly. - Yeah. - That's when you know - Best of luck, boys. It's getting serious now. - Remember to indicate, boys. - Yeah. No slipping and sliding. - Did you say remember to indicate? [Ethan laughing] [epic music] - Little scenic lunch break. Got some fresh air, good vibes. Now I've just seen his outfit. [Vik laughing] No, this is elite. - I'm actually not taking - It's some good scram. Spicy chicken. Come on. - You want a trick as well? - Yeah, go on. - All right. So, pick a card, any card. And you can take it out. But not this one. I'm kidding. You can show the camera. Again, make sure that I don't see it. - You can't see it either. - You wanna see it? - No, they can't see it. - I'm gonna riffle through and whenever you want, you can say stop. Okay? - Stop. - Okay, so you can put and I'll put my half on top like this. Just shuffle a little bit, and whenever you want, again, you can say stop. - Hold it. Hold it. - Hold it. - Stop! - All right. Here we have a number. So I'll use the best number in the pack of cards to find your card. It's number 10. And here we have a red card. So I'll use the red tens to help me find your card. So here we have, as I said, the 10 of diamonds and the 10 of hearts is right here. Do you believe me if I tell you that in three seconds your card will be in between the two tens? [Tobi stammering] You don't believe me? I will count. I will count. If we do it like this, we do one, two, and three. It's done. - That was sick. - That works every time. So for the magic part, I need to count in your native tongue. Is that English or something else? - English. - So we'll do like this, we'll do one, two, and three. Whoops. That's okay. It happens. But you can see in between the two tens there is one card. - No way. Ain't no way that's the 7 of diamonds. - No, it's the 8 of hearts. - How? How, Suey? - We are crossing this river. - I think they're trolling us. - What if we sink? - Then you swim. - I don't like you. [everyone laughing] - No, you can't say that. - That's okay. So now we're gonna make and find ourselves the campsite. - Yes. - Oh, God. - f*cking hell. - Let's do it. - Okay. Whatever you say, boss. - I can't go over it. - We gotta go through it. Oh, my God. - There's a bridge over there. - There's actually a bridge. Yeah. - Oh, my God. - Bog, we're in a f*cking lake. - Oh, my God! - Bog, we're in a lake! - Oh, my f*cking God. Oh, that don't sound good. Jesus Christ. - Through the river we drive. - We made it! Good shift. Good shift. Bit of juice at the end of it. Oh, God. Oh, no, he's stuck. He's stuck, he's stuck, he's stuck. - Yeah. Easy does it. Easy does it. - Oh, my God. We actually made it. - We made it. Smooth operator. - Lovely! [Harry and Ethan cheering] - Come on, Vik! Come on, Vik! - All right. We've been chilling for our activities since the magic. Got a drink. - You know how we do. - This is like the cosiest of cosy vibes. - This is so chill. - It's a bit like Mars. How do you feel? - I'm not even taking it in right now. - It's a bit out this world type beat. - Josh, we're literally in the world. - We're not actually in the world, are we? We're on the world. - We're on the planet, but in the world. - You go into a basement you're in the world. - What? What if the basement is above sea level? - You're still in the world. - What world? - Our world. - Is the world the planet? - We should get high. - You lot are already tall. Listen, if I was six foot- - You would've been [indistinct]. - Ain't no way I'm uglier than JJ. [everyone laughing] [epic music] - Hello. Update. We have lost the crew. They keep radioing saying slow down, but Anton is not slowing down. [epic music continues] We do have fun out here. [Harry screaming] - That one was kind of cold. That one was kind of cold. - That was the one. - Oh, Ethan! - Oh, Ethan! [Vik cheering] [Ethan laughing] - Sideways skirt. - Mad ting. - To be fair- Oh, sh*t. Oh, sh*t. - I think Vik is stuck. [KSI laughing] - I've got no grip. - All right, Vik, just go slowly backwards down the hill. - Vik is stuck. - Vik, what the f*ck are you doing? Give us some beans, Vik! Give us some juice! - I know Ethan is laughing his ass off. [Ethan laughing] - Yeah, I'm getting out. I have to look at this sh*t, man. - Today we got sand-boarding. Tomorrow we got plane-boarding. - Not you stealing my joke. - What joke? - No! - I don't want your joke. - Josh, you literally rolled the camera for me to deliver it. - This is why he's one the funniest Sidemen. - Because he steals all Tobi's jokes. So just know that I'm the real one, yeah? And f*ck Simon Minter. - Your sense of humour - It's dry. - Dry. [everyone laughing] - No, it's not dry! - Dry is not a bad thing for humour. - It's just dead. - Like your sex life. - Oh. - Sorry, was that too personal? Oh, sorry. - Vik's lost it. - We were like slipping and sliding around here. Vik somehow lost it. He's in the crevasse. He's finished. He's finished. - Oh, Vikkstar, have that for indicating, you losers. - That's the thing. We made fun of them. We made fun of them. And then all of a sudden we're like, &quot;Oh, no, we're not - This right here, what you see in the background, is payback for all the, &quot;What are you doing? You can't even make it up a hill, boss.&quot; Stinkers. We even chucked to drifting. [Harry and Ethan chanting] - Oh, piss off. f*ck off. - Stuck down the mountain! They've gone and got [Harry and Ethan laughing] Where you going, Vik?

[everyone laughing] - Okay, so there's volleyball, but there's only one ball. So we take the football. - Come on, Tobi. This shouldn't be easy for you. - Why? - Because you've done your hamstring. - Yeah. You can't sand-board. - You're &quot;injured.&quot; - You prick! - He might do it back to you. Be careful. - I'm injured. I'm injured. - It's really hard to run in the sand. - Useless. - In your eyes! - Desert football might not be the one, you know. - Time to smash it. - VAR.

That's two touch. - You rolled it out. - It was stuck under my foot, bro. - That was two motions. - You can't touch it before I touch it. - I won't. [Tobi chuckling] - One more touch, b*tch. - Why are we stopping? What's popping? - They are stuck. - In the front, the lead car? Not Anton. We can't live without Anton. We're all gonna die out here. - Ayo, Steve, man! Thought you're too big for this! Why are you making cars Steve, you too heavy, man! [KSI laughing] - Right. So now we're gonna do some archery after we declined the challenge. Someone shouted at me and said, &quot;I challenge you to an archery dual.&quot; And I said, &quot;No, I can't do it.&quot; Now we're doing archery. I'm gonna challenge - This is gonna stink. I can tell. Stinker. - That was awful. - Ready? - Yeah.

There's plenty of view to look at. [KSI laughing] - sh*t.

[Ethan laughing] - You all laughed at us. Who's laughing now? We're gonna pull you out. You don't need shovels. - Here we go, Bog! - This is karma. You laughed a bit too much.

Operation save Ethan and Harry's car. - You good? - All right, we are ready. Yep. [everyone cheering] - She's out! - Cool. We did it. - We need to discuss where we're going. He said we're essentially on a glacier, which is 350 metres down, and it's 35 kilometres that way, 35 kilometres that way, and 35 kilometres that way. - JJ wants to camp here. - Well, we need to find somewhere flat apparently. - This is pretty flat. - No, apparently even flatter we need. - Yeah, we need flat. We'll just keep going. Let's go and find a campsite, JJ. - Well, let's look for - I want high ground. I wanna be able to see my enemies before they approach. - She's beautiful, you know. My mom ain't gonna believe this. She ain't gonna believe this. - I sh*t myself. [Josh and Tobi laughing] Don't look at me, bruh. - It's like touching a turkey but it's still alive. That's crazy. Look at my guy holding a falcon, you know. - Oh, look at me. [upbeat music] - What do you boys think - Yeah. No, it's flat. - I love it. I'm a bit worried about the sheer drop to our right, but it is lovely. - I think we should get a little bit closer to the sheer drop. - I'm not opposed to the views. - Let's leave the cars here and walk. - We think this is as - We do too. - Yeah, we're happy with this, man. We're happy. I'd almost say go a tiny bit to your left, maybe. - Nah. I think we want to go a bit more to the right, honestly. - Mate, you speed towards it and we'll see what happens. - I think this is the spot, boys. - Oh, yeah. I'm happy with that. - All right, cool. [mellow music] - I guess this is home for the night. It's nice and homely. Very, you know, warm. A lot of nice foliage. And, you know, things, comfort, it's all around. It's everywhere we look. - What a f*cking journey. I can see myself sleeping here. Oh, I can see it. This is flat. That was flat in my books. - It was almost flatter there than here. - f*cking hell, though. This is outrageous. - You're gonna be able to go down? - God, no. - No? - I've tried snowboarding before and I was not able to stand. So this is not- - Yeah, but this is just sand, bro. - It is sand. You are correct. - You won't be able to stand, but you will be able to sand. - This is not gonna work. - It will, man. - I tried to snowboard. I almost died. - You didn't die, though. And what doesn't kill - Do you know what's That felt emotionally distressful, hard work, and all we've done is We've done nothing! We've not done an activity! All we've done is go shopping and get to our campsite, and it's taken us over half the day. - All right, so welcome to Langjokull. - What? - Langjokull. - Long yoghourt. - Yeah. It's the long yoghourt. - Long yoghourt! - We have some tents and sleeping bags in the back. So now we're gonna make camp. - It's a good idea. While it's still light. - Once the camp's ready, we'll do some adventuring in the glacier. - Nice. - Where? - On the GPS. - Go for a drive a bit. You have two tents. Choose if you put them both up or if you all snuggle in one. - I would love to. - I mean, it could be a good idea. [Anton laughing] - I'm gonna die. - No, man. Just believe. - I feel like I'm not tied in here enough. - Josh, man, it don't matter. - Josh, just roll. If anything goes wrong, roll. Yeah! - No. - Yeah! - Yeah! [Tobi cheering] - Let's go. - Let's go. - I'm terrified! - That was hard, though. Go on, Simon. - You got this. Easy. Just lean forward, I think. - Ah! [Tobi and Josh cheering] - That was sick. - I think I might need you know? Right foot first. - Yeah. - It felt like here. - That was hard. - We don't have a tent! Anton, we don't have a tent! - I honestly thought I - I'm gonna kill myself. - There's a cliff just over there. - Yeah. I'll see you boys in a bit, man. Oh, my God. We have to work this hard just to sleep, brother. Never in my life. - Vik, give us our tent back! - No. Anton gave this to us. - This is ours! - No, it's not! That is ours out of our car! - This is ours! - Anton! - Ask Anton for a tent. He'll help you out. - Yes, I got it out! I climbed in the car and got it out! - I'm not a judge here. - It's our tent! - I'm pretty sure Anton gave it to us! - I'll murder this lad! - We drove it here. - I drove it here and I climbed in there to get it out! It's my tent! - Anton, before there's you need to decide. [crosstalk] - It was in our f*cking car. - I just found this tent on the floor. [everyone laughing] - All right, Anton, we'll take the bigger tent. - Once you go on that little path, you're good. Here we go. Till the naan. [Tobi screaming] [Josh and Simon cheering] - Yeah! - That was sick. - That was sick. - Did man look slow? - It didn't look fast. [crosstalk] - Go! [Tobi laughing] - That hurt my bum. [Josh and Tobi laughing] You know the term, &quot;the [indistinct] in your arsehole&quot;? [Tobi laughing] - He landed and his cheeks spread. - I think what we do, right, is we pretend to build it and then just get him to build it. - All right, here we go. Yeah, that's in there. - Pretty much there. - Excuse me! JJ, you building a sh*thole? - Yes. - That's too close to camp. - That's a bit too close. - How far do you wanna go? - It's not that bad. We've already pissed in that. - What if we need to sh*t in our sleep? - Oh, you've got a tent now. - It's bigger. - It's the same one. - It's a three person. - Let's go over there. Let's go to the other side of the van. - Okay. [Harry stammering] - Nah, that's too close, man. It's too close. It's too close. - Just peak out of the tent. - I don't wanna wake up to squatting. That's not what I wanna wake up to, mate. - Stand more. - No, if I stand I'll fall. - That's a paradox. - You got this. - No! [Tobi and Josh laughing] - It's weird, right? - It feels so odd. - Oh, God. [Josh laughing] - I ate sand, boy. I got a mouth full of sand, boy. - I'm bleeding out. - Take a seat, mate. Take a seat. Why is he-? I think he's come. - I think we'll just cast a spell on it. And I think we'll come back maybe in like five minutes. - Revellia! Oh, wait, what is it? What's the-? - Sweepidy-swoopidy, gibbidy-gemp, Icelandic men, please build my tent. - Yes. - Vik, this is our toilet. - Okay. - Also, the shovel's broken. - Okay. JJ, can you put those together? - You lot don't know the smell! - They haven't figured it out yet. [Ethan laughing] - Yeah, there's a magic spell! - Which one? - You have to find out. - Harry loves a magic spell. - It's the exact same tent. - I think we've got three equal size. Okay. We've got a small one for the front. No, no, don't help them! Just let them work it out! - Stop! - I'm currently waiting. I fell off the board. Oh! Suddenly I'm all right being injured. - Sun's about to set. That is ridiculous view. Simon's getting a plaster over there. First aid kit. And then after the sun sets you have drinks and we go down there for dinner. That's all gonna be lit up. Whilst other boys are you know, we have sun, we have sand. They probably have snow, or, who knows. - Yeah. Now we just keep going. Feed it in. - Keep going. Keep going, keep going. - Ease it in, man! - There we go. Cool, cool, cool. Right, that's it. - Now look at that. - What do you mean? - Look. - Yeah, that's fine. - No. Look at it. It's all trinkled up. - Well, that's your f*cking- - I'm not playing this. - They're in turmoil. - Well, I could sleep in that. - Bro, they got the other one up. - Should we just swap ours with theirs? - Can we have your tent? - And you can have ours. - Come here. Let's go. - What do we do? - What are you guys doing? You getting help, yeah? - No, no, no. We're helping them build their tent. - Why? - Because we are just helping people. [Harry mumbling] [Ethan laughing] Eventually they're gonna help us, right? Surely. - Look at all the help you're getting. How's this even fair? - They need help, brother. They're special. Special team. - Outrageous. - Keep that going through. - Why are you so quiet, Ethan? Can't you see there are two other people helping you? Harry, say something! - Hello. I'm doing it. Look, see, I'm putting Look. - d*ckheads. - I don't understand salt. [upbeat music] - I feel like my friend Simon Miniminter would enjoy it, but he's over there maybe not enjoying it. - Simon, we miss you! - I believe I may have two bum holes now. Because when I went down that slope I felt something stretch I never felt stretched before. I think- My life flashed from my eyes again. - Side+ to the moon. Wait, wait, wait. Stay there. Oh, sh*t. I'm going. Look up. Now look to your right. More. Up more. That's hard. That's hard. [Tobi laughing] That's hard. - There's pizza over there. - Yeah. Come. Oh, sh*t. - Is your toe coming off? - Yeah, he's taking it. But we don't have to pay for this anymore 'cause they kept the toe. - All right. - Are we done? [KSI and Vik laughing] - Now, now. - That could have been our tent. We gave you guys that tent. - You sure you don't want this tent? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Your time will come. Your time will come. - I'll get my lighter out. - Oh, my God. - A genuine stinker. Do you want help? - Please! - I'll come and help once we've checked out our gap. Oh, wait. Oh, sh*t. We've got like a little porch. This is sick. So this is where we leave our boots. - Oh. - And then this is the crib. - Yo! - We living. - This is kinda sick. We got space. - I can't believe they complained about and we just went and got - She's in, but she's too short. Please, Vik. [crosstalk] - Because they're gonna claim credit now. - No, I don't care. I'll take it. 'Cause if I let go- - It's fine. - You have ones on the - You've got big penis force. - I know tents. - Tent knowledge. - Look, it's not quite as nice. - No, yours is different, bruv. - We're going to have dinner down there in this beautiful location. - It's very beautiful. - I can't wait to go down there because there's fire. - You see how red it goes? - It is actually kind of cold. - Hey, look at the lighting, bro. - Jeez. You see that? - Watch this. Josh, watch this. - Wow! - That's horrible. - Your turn, then. - I ain't doing that. I'd look like JJ back [everyone laughing] - I remember that clip. - I'm gonna tell you a hack. - Yeah. Okay. - Take a shovel without putting any snow in this tent. Dig a hole here. - Yeah. - So you can actually sit inside the tent with a straight back and your legs in the hole. This means when you getting dressed in the morning and dressing up at dawn you. You know what? - Not the tent, Anton. - Go to work! - Why is there a chainsaw in your tent? - Well, don't ask any questions, man. - We're making a toilet! - In the tent. - Yeah, man. We're gonna be warm, protected. - We're getting that customization. - Yeah. - Anton has supplied me It's weird. I've never had dried fish before. You chew it. [Vik mumbling] I'm also seeing snow come flying out of their tent. What is going on? - Oof. It is smoky in here. Very pretty. - How pretty, Josh? - Very pretty. - Very pretty. - Like me. Very pretty. - Just look over there. - What is it? - You see the bird? Right there. - I couldn't see it. Ain't no way. - Ugh. - Oh, can we do it? Can we do it? Can we do it? - For the next step, we're gonna drive into quite a dangerous zone. It's where the glacier is crawling forward about 10 to 50 metres every year, and there are big crevasses, so we need you to stay behind me in a single line. And when you step outside don't leave with cars. - All right. So this is a harness. - We've all worn harnesses. - Yeah. Put the harness on. Once we are hooked in the line, the idea is that if one person falls in- - Everyone else stops them. - Yeah, we are there to make sure the rest doesn't fall in as well. We are not gonna fall in with him. So this is an ice axe. This is our break. In theory, if you would fall in- - Someone just cuts the - Yeah. I'll have a knife and I'll just go, &quot;Bye-bye!&quot; No, we use the ice axe to break. If you don't break with the ice axe, we all go together into the crevasse. - Oh, great. - We'll all be a nice little sandwich at the bottom. - Okay. - Is he gonna come around to the table and ask? Yes, I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. - If you're ready to fly, you can join me if you like. - He wants to do it. - He will fly. I give him the glove. He will land on your hand. - Oh, let's do it. Let's do it. The bird's gonna land on you. - Listen, they do that all the time. You know what I'm saying? - Okay. Okay. - I'm joking. I'm joking. I'm the ugly Sidemen, remember that? - True. - Oh, sh*t. - As much as I want the low-key want it to take his face off. - It's already here. He landed on my hand! - I mean, it would be funny. That's nuts. [man whistles] [everyone laughing] - He got hit in the face. You see that? - No, we good with just him. - That's so cold. You've gotta do it. You've gotta do it. - Sure, sure, sure. - He's cold. - Should someone join you? - Yeah, I'll join him. - Together. - You sure? - One, two, three. [Josh laughing] - I felt it touch me. [Harry mumbling] - Hello everybody. I am not behind the wheel anymore. It feels amazing. - Yes. - It feels so amazing I'm sick of driving in Sidemen videos. It's always me. Road trip. - You wanted to drive. - It did stroke my ego a tiny bit. My penis got strokes. This next activity I'm - When I go to sleep at night I listen to podcasts - Yeah. Yeah. - Like, this is dangerous. - And we're about to - Yeah, yeah. Big time. No one's gonna find us because we're out in the f*cking sticks. - It's just what you wanna hear. Right. So if you don't see from us here on out, it's been a pleasure. Thanks for watching. Like and subscribe. Goodbye. - The lights have gone off. - There's a man with camels. There is a man with camels and a fire. - Bro, this is like &quot;The Lion King.&quot; Just a real life &quot;Lion King.&quot; - Are they gonna come down the hill? - Camel's are actually bear weird if you think about it. - They're horses with humps. They're gonna take all the treasure. - What? Where did she come from? - She was there chilling - Oh, God. [tribal music] - And this is where they surprise us. Boom. It's Freya. [everyone laughing] What's happening? - Hey guys. It's Freya. - They're setting her on fire, man. [tribal music continues] - You having a great time? - I'm so lost. - He's having a great time. And what are the other team doing, then? What are they doing? - That's that glacier fresh water down there. Not the easiest trail to walk on. I have to say. I prefer a little mountainside path with some stairs. - You're not wrong at all. She's blowing. - Oh, this is a serious leg day coming back up here. I regret everything. - Where are we going? - Every step down I take. Oh, wow. Look at the ice clip ahead. [tribal music continues] - You see that? - Yo! - You didn't see that? - That was nuts. - It's a full on fire show now. [upbeat music] - She about to do- Oh, oh. - She's playing with fire. - She got the sparklers out now. She's setting herself on fire. - Oh, my eyes! - What's happened? What's happened? - Whoa. - It's heating up. - She's got a sword. - Waiting for the drop. - How is she not dizzy? - Wow! [audience applauding] - Bro, I went blind twice. - Look at that. You see straight through it. - You're brave standing under that, you know. - Yeah. Go for it. - That glacier fresh, pure ice. Bro, look how clear it is. It's like glass. - Holy sh*t. We've got a free snack. This is low calorie. - Icelandic. - What is it? - Glacier ice. - What does it look like? - In there in the corner is a little cavern that we are walking to. We're gonna walk here along the glacier, under this here, into the cavern. We can all peek into the - Yeah. - And then we can walk back. - Okay. Cool. I don't wanna be stood underneath. I thought it was gonna fall on my head or something. - Something just made a noise over there. - If that falls, can I catch it? - No. You instantly die. - I think I can catch that. It's obviously a sham, right? - You think you're Hercules, lad? - I'll catch it. - So, food. We have some meatballs on potato. We have some mushrooms just for Josh. And we've got pumpkin So, there you go. - Now I have mine. - There you go. - No, no, no. Portions. Portions. Portions. - Isn't this delightful, lads? Just some young strapping boys. - All right. They've just served our main course. - Look at it. - Main course has just been served. Tuck in, Josh. - I don't wanna tuck in. - Tuck in. Tuck in. - It's trying to escape. - Oh, my God. - That is cool, man. - Wow. - Pretty cool. - Dashing through the snow. - We've lost Vik. - Brother. I'm barely tall enough. - We've lost me. Boys! Wait! You know what's fun to think about, Vik? - Yeah? - There's holes here that go down like 200 metres. - No, more, up to a kilometre. - Oh, Lord. Hey, John. That's mental, that is. Wow-wee. [mellow music] - I was about to start making food, but I think there's a show starting again. It sounds loud. [audience cheering] That's the guy- - He taped up my toe. - Yeah. - Oh, no way. Bet he's gonna balance on them. - No. You trolling? - Huh? - No wonder he was good at sand-boarding. - Yeah, he can do this. He's showing you up. - Harry, don't take me out. - I'll try. Vik, Vik, Vik! If you break it there, you'll be fine, but I'll be dead. - Sounds like a fantastic day. Nearly stabbed myself through the leg with my [indistinct]. But you know, we move. - It's so deep. - Harry, don't slide into me and kick me. I'll die. They are under literally like 50,000 tonnes of ice. - Yeah, you're finished. It's collapsing. - Don't touch it too much, John. - What do we do if the - We die. Holy sh*t. Wow. - Mad ting. - You think I'm disturbing the beast when I'm doing that? - The glacier, please. - I'm drilling things into it. - This could collapse at any second. - It really could. - Look at it, man. This thing's gonna collapse. - I think I'm quite happy here. - Well, I gotta come in, bro, you gotta shift down. - No way. - Ain't no way, boy. How? Oh, sh*t! - Bruh! [audience applauding] - No, not again. Another one? - Another one? - That looks terrifying. That looks terrifying. - He's getting a fire stick, too! What? How do you stop? - How do you get down? [Simon cheering] - What? Nuts. Nuts. - He's celebrating like that's the first time he did it. - Yeah. Honestly. - I'm terrified. - How much ice do you think is above your head? - Like 50,000 tonnes. - I think a few million. - Should we play-? What's the game? It's essentially like Jenga. Like we each have one hack at it and see when it collapses. - Yeah. - Let's start. [everyone laughing] - This piece of the glacier, it moves. - How much? - About 13 metres a year. 15 metres a year. - So that's like 30 centimetres a day. - 3 centimetres a day. - Right where we are now, there's like a drop underneath. So somewhere there's a cave that goes further into the glacier. You take the light and - Imagine you just see a person in there. - Oh wow. - You just see a face staring at you through the ice. - There was someone lost here a few years ago. - Imagine they just turn up. They're just half out of the bottom of the glacier. - Dave! Bloody hell! - There's no way. There's no way. - Are you mad? That is outrageous. - That's balancing that way and balancing the other way. [audience cheering] - That is nuts. [audience cheering] - That was nuts. - That was sick actually. - That was crazy. - Oh, God! - No one's even filming. - John is. - All right. Come and stand with us. - It's Chris Jericho! - No. Just come and stand. - From the top rope! - Bro, not on the expensive light. - Sorry. I was just trying to do something. - Can't take this guy anywhere. - Just trying to create content. - Yeah, the content where we get crushed by 70,000 tonnes. - What if we don't even make it out? This is traumatic. I want to go home. [playful music] - Oh, sh*t! Sorry. I just trying to get you boys. - All right, let's go. - Yeah, let's get out of here. - I'm alive. I am indeed. Thank you, sir. Great find. - So is this rock next to us or mud? - It's ice covered by a little bit of dust. It's all ice. - Volcanic dust? - Look underneath him. - I see. Yeah. - Really not as big as I imagined, but it's a cool little spot. We could camp there overnight. - Just finished dinner. Act number three about to step onto the stage. Supposedly the best. [epic music] - Oh! - That was cool! - Get ready for that heat, boy. - Oh, God. It's still in his mouth. [crosstalk] He's cold. [epic music] - That was hard. - Wow! [upbeat music] - Don't mind me just Whoa. Watch this. f*ck. Crazy. [upbeat music] - Jeez, boys. This is the spot. This is the spot. That hot camping ain't - We got our little- - Are we a lounge fire? [crosstalk] - We could take some fire, man. - What a day? - What a day. - Is he about to do something else? This is his final form. [epic music] Bro. - He's a fire breather. - Bruh! He's literally spitting fire. You know how cool he is? Oh, they're gonna do the sign. - That's so hard. - What's happening behind it? - They set off that sparklers. - That's the sparkly one. That's cool. - This is hard. - This is nuts. This is mad. Isn't this romantic? - Oh, it is. It does feel quite romantic, I'm not gonna lie. - Anton, join us. [everyone laughing] I thought you'd never ask. - What do you think of - I like this. - Shall we eat something? - Please. - Yes, please. - I've heard you guys can cook, right? [crosstalk] My parents are farmers and they sent me with We have some Icelandic lamb meat that we've been carrying Fillets and prime. And the grill is ready. The potatoes are getting there. Who's gonna be grilling? - I can give it a go. - No, KSI's not allowed to. Don't let him cook. - Drinks. - Let him cook. - Is there a water as well? - Why do you need that? - I'm parched. - We can probably get some water. - I'll take a beer as well. - Whoo! All right. So, boys. We have apple tatin tarte. I don't know what that is. And chocolate [indistinct]. It doesn't say what the other one is, but I guess we'll find out. - You know what? Even better. - Gobble on that. - I respect that. - You have to match his odds, Josh. - What does his odds say? - Zero. So you gotta do it. Gobble on it. - You just put your whole mouth around it? - Yeah. Look. - You could handle a girthy one. - I know. - I forgot Josh can't eat. [Tobi laughing] Hey, hey, hey! Don't touch my sh*t, boy. - That's some quality lamb right there. [KSI laughing] - No pressure. - Don't ruin this f*cking lamb. If you ruin this lamb, yeah, I'm gonna sh*t in your tent. Like, in it. - Oh, boys. Oh, we are going to be eating good. This is seasoned nice. [KSI laughing] - Meat flip. Meat Flip. Meat flip. - Do you want a meat flip? - No. 'Cause what if the meat - I can just see it. [everyone laughing] - Cue music. No. Harry, we can have a glass of champagne. [Ethan laughing] - I'll need a bit more than this. [everyone laughing] That's good. That's good. [everyone laughing] This is to good drinks, good company and good glaciers. - Yes. - Crazy, crazy. - Cheers, boys, cheers. - f*cking hell. It's cold. - There's nothing like Coke Zero at the end of the day. f*cking hell. - Do you want some of my vape? - Your vape? - Ice pack. Ice pack. - What pack is that? [KSI laughing] [mellow music] - We're back at the camp. This is lovely. It's nice and peaceful. - Bro, you can actually see the stars in the sky. Wait for me. - We can't have a fire there. We can have a fire in front our room. - Yeah. In a corner. We have the whole corner. - What are you doing? We're gonna start a fire in our room. Place ablaze. Burn everything. No one survives. - What? - What are you talking about? - I love you, buddy. - Love you too, bro. - Do you actually? - Big time. Yeah, of course. - For real? - Yeah. Come on. - Ah. I f*cking hate you, bro. Once this camera goes off I'm gonna- Oh, I thought we'd cut. - So there's one thing we forgot. You have to make a toilet. - Couldn't we just make a hole? - Where's your chainsaw? [everyone laughing] - Chainsaw! - That's horrid. I have no problem. I will hold my poo in. I will hold my poo. I'm not pooing in a chainsaw toilet, man. I'm not doing it, man. [everyone screaming] - Now I have to do this. - Now there's a seat. I'm more than happy. I'm more than happy to go now there's a seat. [Anton mumbling] - It's a bit more respectful. Toilet boys, go and make your toilet. - You should go and build the toilet if you're going to desecrate there. - Go and make it for later. JJs gonna block the toilet and it's gonna be used. It's gonna be down the sides. - Can't we just make four toilets? - Just make the hole deep enough. - Four holes. - What? Just take the seat every time? The more we talk about poo, I can go. Have we got the wipes in there? - Yeah. Vik bought toilet paper. [KSI laughing] [Josh mumbling] - I don't know why. We're not even going that fast. This is rapid. [crosstalk] - Thank you. We could've walked that. I know I said I was going to bed, but I might sit outside for a little bit. - Yeah, I feel that. - Harry, are you coming to sh*t or not? - No, I'm not. I didn't sh*t for two weeks once. I can hold it in for a night. [everyone laughing] - Come on. We're gonna sh*t up here. - Get away! It's next to our tent! Ethan, that's our tent right there. Our tent is there. You can see it. - We should go into the darkness. We should go. - Go get away from there, please. [Ethan laughing] Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. You children. [KSI and Ethan laughing] Over here. Where that spade is. Where that spade is. Don't do it over there. [KSI and Ethan laughing] - This light pollution this guy's providing is awful. - Get rid of your light pollution. - There we go. - This is beautiful. - Oh, now we're talking. Now we're peaceful. - Now it feels like we're in the desert. This is nice. Look at this. This is beautiful. Oh, how you rating the experience? - It's very calming. - You ever tell me I would camp in the desert, I'd look at you like, what? This is beautiful. I'm glad I got to share - Oh yeah. [playful music] - So where do we sit to sh*t? - So if we put them like this, dig this hole deeper, we're still up here, and then we just like. - Wow. [chainsaw wheezing] - They're not happy about this at all. They're not happy, not one bit. Oh, my God. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then you just hover on that. Are you ready to go? - I can squeeze some right now. - 'Cause I can go right now. - This ain't no toilet. This is a throne. [KSI laughing] - Whoever sh*ts first is quite like a cool experience. The second sh*t- - No, you just cover it with snow. - You know what's lurking. - We need the toilet paper. - Everything is gonna get quite yellow. [everyone laughing] - What are you doing? [Tobi chuckling] - What she sees. I'd go camping all the I don't need those little tents. - Imagine being in the cold right now and it being windy in a tent that you've made yourself. - Yeah. Anyone know any scary stories? I got one. Sidemen. Seven young boys. They went to a Ukrainian prison. A video of KSIs. - Right? - They weren't allowed to leave. - Seven of them? - A few of them. They spent a night there getting fondled by actors that a member had paid to poo on them. After all of this, the video got demonetized. [everyone laughing] - They suffered for nothing? - The funny thing is, it's a real story. - God forbid. God forbid. - I'm gonna need serenity. No, please. No, please. John, I can't. I need to be at one with myself for this experience. Oh, my God. Oh, wow. [Ethan laughing] You lot is coming out already. Oh, she stinks! Oh, my God! That's a whole day's worth of pain coming out of me. Oh, my God. She stinks. I'll tell you what, though. This position for the legs, right, is really healthy. [Ethan laughing] This was the best decision of my day. - Boys, this food slaps. - Is it good? - Mate. - is an amazing chef when it comes to the food. - Oh, my God, bro. Oh, my God. Look at this. - And it's warm in here, you know? - Oh, my God. We're living the life. - We are getting lit. - The litty committee. - Oh, that's warm. - This is amazing, by the way. Because when I grew up and I was taught to light fires, that was the last thing [crosstalk] - Never do what? [everyone laughing] - Any eyebrows are done. - I can spare some. - Please. - You know what? I think it's time we max out [indistinct] in there. - He's a smart man, you know. - Oh, Harry. It's too late for your salmon. - Harry, you ain't cooking salmon on that. Oh, my God, that's delicious. That's so good. [everyone laughing] - We told him not to. He's making smoked salmon. That's how they do it. - That poor fish could And here it dangles. It's dangling. - Because it tastes good. - What do you do when you go camping? - I think it's a whole and doing nothing. - Don't you normally cook food and like-? - I feel like this camera's melting. Not my problem. - That's the falcon. - Did you hear that bird? [Simon farting] [everyone laughing] - So childish that you all laughed. - No, no, no. This is dreadful. [everyone screaming] - Did you hear it? - It's more black than pink. - It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. - It looks like a pork chop. - From f*cking &quot;Minecraft.&quot; That salmon's been downing fuels. - On God it's not bad. It's not bad. - On God? - It's very edible. - On God. - On God this salmon slaps. - It's not the end of- Oh, no. Oh, the aftertaste is vile. - Because you're eating the end. - No, I didn't. I ate the bit you ate. The aftertaste is dead. - What was the aftertaste? Is it fuel? - Yes. It's like charred fuel. - I'll try a bit. - It's aight. - That's okay. I'm gonna go back for seconds, Harry. - Thank you. - Can I have a Sour Patch Kid, please? I told you. It's getting worse and worse. - Legit. [playful music] - Fox? - Tobi and John, late night desert exploration. - This video is going to turn into a horror movie. - We heard strange noises. So we went to explore. - What if they ever come back? - Foot prints. But they're going that way. Where did they come from? Where did they go? Where did they come from, Cotton-Eye Joe? I'm waiting to get bit by like a snake or something. I don't even know if [Tobi whistling] Bro, it's so peaceful out here. Look at this. Look at this. It's beautiful, man. The fox has pussied out, but we'll get him next time. - All right. It's time to go to bed, man. Where's our f*cking sh*t tent? - You're going the wrong way. - Have I? There she is. I completely forgot where she was. Right, so I've been told- I have to take my stuff off here. Oh, sh*t. Hat off. Jesus Chris, man. This is crazy. - Just letting my body before I get in my tent. It'll be worth it. This is an investment. [indistinct] To all the sh*t. Warming up. I can't lie. It's the way to do it. - All right. So this is Ethan checking into bed. I've got a pillow. I've got a sleeping bag. I'm in my condom. I'm f*cking [indistinct]. Goodbye everyone. - Would be so much - Everything would be Why do people live here? I can't be arsed. I just wanna go to bed! - Boys, I've enjoyed this trip. Thank you for sharing it with me. - You're welcome. [Simon and Tobi laughing] - It's two in the morning. - At least we get to see the sunrise. - Sunrise is at 7:00 AM. - Oh, okay. Well, as I go to sleep, I'd like to watch a crisp burn. Please, Josh. - Once again. - What do you mean once again? This is the first time. - Watch everyone burn. Sorry. I keep doing it. I keep going into some Anyways, I'm actually going to bed. I'll catch you boys early in the morning. - Goodbye, Simon. - Goodbye. - Why am I sat here at midnight in -12 degrees trying to work out how the self-inflating - Man thought he was going straight to bed. - Where is the self-inflating? - I think it takes time, bro. - It just takes time? - Yeah. JJ's done. - JJ's ain't got sh*t. - JJ's in the car. - JJ's hasn't got sh*t. - Oh, this looks more inflated than yours. - What did you say? - His looks more inflated. - Not his. Mine. Mine looks more inflated. - You know when we inflate our mattresses? - Yeah. - Yeah. They ain't done it. So now they can't sleep. - I'll tell you, yeah. Listen, yeah. [everyone laughing] This is the deadest thing. I tried going to sleep and now I'm just getting angry. It's so sh*t. It's so cold in here. My toes are f*cking freezing. I've rolled my hat. I tried this at one point. - It's just not it, man. - See this, yeah. See this day, here today, this is the worst day! - I'm gonna go piss through my teeth. - Shut the door. - I can't do it, man. - Mate, you need to hydrate more. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! People pay good money for this sh*t, man. - This is so nasty. That's nasty, bro. - I brushed my f*cking tongue. Do you not? - Yeah, I do. Just the way you were doing it was nasty. - So we're finished chilling We're now in my lovely abode right here. Actually very cosy, quite nice. It's very peaceful. And outside is so bliss and quiet. Yeah, we just sat by the fire for like two, three hours. Chilling, chatting, eating Pringles, and just looking to the sky, really, 'cause it is just peaceful and wholesome. So hopefully the other team's more chaotic because our team feels like it's been very relaxed, very zen experience. Right, I was cleaning my teeth. Oh, it's moved. Oh, it's back. Okay. I don't know how we can see this. Thing is moving in the corner of the room. He's an ant. That's an ant, right? Not a spider. He had a friend who was a normal-sized ant and I can't find where he's gone. But it's fine, I'll let him go about his day. But I need go to bed. We have agreed to wake up at six thirty because the sun rises at seven on the dot. And our rooms, our &quot;nests,&quot; are sunrise nests. So over that big dune, which we climbed up earlier, is where the sun's gonna rise. - You hear this when you and you're just pickaxing into ice. - f*cking hell. - We'll see you in the tomorrow. Hopefully we all still exist and we are not frozen. f*cking good, goodnight. - Goodnight, Vik. - Goodnight. - I think I'm gonna pass away. I feel like I'm gonna pass away tonight. - Bro, it's been going like this for like an hour. [Vik mumbling] There is a snowstorm outside. - We gonna wake up snowed in. - Jesus. Like the wind has been nuts. - Bro, are you pissing in our front porch? - Yep. [KSI laughing] - You're pissing inside our own f*cking tent, in our front porch. - I had to go. - This is where we live. - I know. - Honestly, I don't blame you. It sounds like death out there. It sounds like you'll That's mad, that. - Okay, so it is six or six forty now, which we agreed to wake up and meet up. And radio silent. - It's like six thirty and we are getting up to go look at the sunrise. I want to die. But at least we get see the sunrise in the desert. So that's pretty cool. I wish we'd gone to bed earlier, but we ended up just Okay, let's get up. I might be the only one awake. - It's so early. You are telling me it's leave time now? - We're waking up to pack and leave, yeah. - Okay. Here's the game plan. I'm just gonna pretend no one woke me up and then just wait for them to wake me up again. Because there's no reason why at seven-twelve we're up. I refuse to believe that. - Rise and shine, my brudda. - Sounds dreadful out there. - Yeah, bro. It don't look and sound great. I can't lie. f*ck me, man. What a way to wake up. [wind whistling] - But it looks like I'm on a different planet right now. I'm on Mars or something. It's actually weird as hell. But we're gonna go up there and we're gonna watch But it's quite cloudy. Weirdly. I don't think they're coming. It is early in the morning, innit? So at the top, I'm not really sure we're gonna see much. It's very overcast. We have friends. We have friends. Look. Mr. Miniminter is there. And then Mr. Tobi is back there. They're making it in time. It's very cloudy. - We woke up at 6:30 AM to see dust. - Yeah, but it's like Mars though. - How is it like Mars, Josh? 'Cause you've been, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. So it looks like- Seen &quot;The Martian&quot;? - Isn't Mars red? - Yeah, but it has got a slight red hue to it, hasn't it right now? - No. [KSI laughing] - I hate my life. So long. - Take me back to my bedroom. I feel like Leonardo - Why? What would he do? Slip inside a bear? - He'd be in a house while this is happening. - Yeah. He's an actor. It's not real. - I feel like Pokimane wouldn't do this. - No YouTuber would do this. Why do we do this? I finished my sleeping bag. JJ is struggling with his. Not easy. Wow. [wind drowning Vik out] - Hot air balloons. - I see three. - I see one, two, three, four. - Wow. That's a big head. That's just rude. - I was kind of more saying your head is full of hot air. - I don't think we're seeing much. It's over there somewhere apparently, but I'm not really seeing I'm seeing just white and grey and fog. Not worth it. You can see these slide marks. That was anticlimactic I guess. You know what? We are meeting again for breakfast in about an hour. So I'm gonna get some more sleep before breakfast. I think that's what I deserve. Like a true king. - Our lives are crazy, man. - How'd you sleep in general? - Honestly, like, I mean, it was all right, but it wasn't the most comfortable thing in my life. But it was like, it's not about that, innit? - It was warm, right? - Yeah. It's just cool. As in like, not temperature cool. Like, I was warm, I was just inside. I was like, &quot;Holy sh*t.&quot; You know when you're inside your house, pouring with rain and there's a storm. It was kind of like that. Hear it f*cking moving. It was going crazy. Sounds were nuts, bro. Yeah, I was there like, &quot;Go on then, nature. f*cking do it. Show us your worst!&quot; - I wake up, thing's unzipped, I'm like, &quot;What's going on?&quot; He's there in the f*cking porch of our tent pissing. - Bro, it was still sounding mad. I'm just saying, bro, Pokimane wouldn't do this. - Pokimane would not do this. Listen, Pokimane, if you want to be on our level, build a toilet and sh*t in it. - Okay. All showered up. Suitcase ready. And it's time to go back and leave this place. Oh, the sun actually finally rose. You can actually see the sun. What a beautiful breakfast. What a beautiful breakfast morning. - Guys, the sun rose. - Sun finally came out. - Congratulations. - You had a nap. Did you? - I did. - I thought about it. - That's half the battle. - But I overcame it. - You came over your nap? - I win the battle or lose the battle? - Depends what your objective was, Josh. - He has an itchy tongue - Weak ass buddy. - Anyways, we actually need to go. Our time in the desert has come to an end. That was fun, camping. - Desert, it's been good. Now back to the hood. - f*cking hell. [indistinct chatter] - What you think, Vik? - Got that heat, boy. - Vik just dropped an egg in the toilet and now he's dropping eggs in the pool. What did it smell like, Vik, after a day of-? - Pretty non-remarkable. - Consistency. What was it like? - How many pumps? - How many pumps? [KSI laughing] A handful. - Consistency. Harder than usual? - Yeah. Quite dense. It's been compacted. Been compacted by the cold. It was cold. Well, we survived the cold camping. We've warmed ourselves with a hot bath. If you guys enjoyed and wanna see something even more extreme in the future, leave a like. [indistinct chatter] [upbeat music]
