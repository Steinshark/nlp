bare ground, Barren hills and bare rocks. From time to time, an oasis. Everywhere, an implacable heat. The Maghreb desert. In appearance, a kind of nothingness, Where organic has no place. Yet, whether it be sand or stones, These desert expanses are populated by small creatures. The desert is a mosaic of different biotopes. Each species has chosen the one that suits it best. sand for burrowers, Rocks for those who can slip through small gaps. The rare shrubs being the domain of winged animals and climbers. Throughout evolution, insects and mammals, Beetles and saurians have adapted, Each in its own way, to aridity. But in extreme conditions, The competition is even tougher than elsewhere. Often, The survival of some presupposes the death of others. 3 p.m., 60 degrees in the sun. A big-tailed black scorpion goes hunting. The Scorpion is a member of the spider family, And like his cousins, he's pretty myopic. On the other hand, He has very sensitive sensory organs on his claws, Long bristles that react to the slightest movement of air. Only, These receivers of waves and vibrations do not inform it precisely, On the identity of the one who passes by. They may as well lead him to prey, than an adversary. Like the skink. This curious saurian is the specialist of Scorpions. He does not hesitate to attack the most dangerous of them, This one exactly, Endowed with deadly venom. You just have to know how to take it. Scorpio understood that this confrontation was to his disadvantage. And the skink, which missed its attack, Prefer not to insist. One might think that these parched plains, Never see a single drop of water. However, it happens 3 or 4 times a year that violent rains, Fall down somewhere in the mountains, Causing huge floods. The wet are then filled with water reddened by the earth, They snatch in their path. small ponds, Sometimes found in the northern Sahara, Are the residues of these flash floods. Some of them are almost permanent. Fortunately for animals unable to live without water. For example, those turtles with a very ugly name, The leprous emydes. Temporary or permanent, These ponds of course attract all the fauna of the surroundings. Approaching it is both Try your luck to find prey, And run the risk of making fatal encounters there. No enmity between the tortoise and the chameleon, Simply the distrust of someone who meets a stranger. Apart from aquatic species such as turtles, Almost all desert animals are content, From the only water contained in their food. This is the case with Scorpio. But if the opportunity arises, He gladly quenches his thirst. Moreover, Scorpio knows well that he will find, Right here, Amount of insects to eat. The chameleon too Although he prefers to hunt in shrubs. Crickets, locusts, flies, The chameleon has a fairly diverse diet. And why not taste this critter, Which looks like a huge spider. novice hunter, This young chameleon does not suspect what he is risking, By attacking a black scorpion. A first bite will numb his paw, For a few minutes. Not content to have beaten the pawn to his aggressor, The scorpion returns to the charge. There's only one way to neutralize a scorpion, Immediately severed its poisonous sting. In the absence of such a precaution, We expose ourselves to one or more lethal injections, For the scorpion's venom contains violent toxins, Which very quickly paralyze the nervous system. The Scorpion managed to sting in the Chameleon's only tender spot, The eyelid. But he'll end up smothered by that jawbone, Who can't let go anymore. Intrigued by the scene, Another chameleon approaches, To realize that his congener is already almost dead. If the chameleon is the most nonchalant of the inhabitants of the desert, The most lively is undoubtedly this one, Centipede. She never ceases to inspect the rocky crevices, To find his favorite little insects. His nervous gait causes vibrations that attract, Unmistakably the attention of marauding scorpions. To deceive the enemy, The Scolopendra has in front of the mouth, A poisonous claw and as a tail, An identical appendix. So much so that you never know which way to take it. The scorpion grabs the victim with its claws. Anxious to save his precious venom, It only stings with its sting if they are too restless. With centipede, There is no hesitation. Also endowed with poisonous fangs, The centipede stings the scorpion at the joints, Between two segments of cuticles. This one tries to make him let go, Using his spur. The Scorpion has immobilized while waiting for its venom to act. Nothing can disturb him at this crucial moment. Except this awkward passer-by who will rub the knife in the wound. Firmly held by one of the scorpion's claws, centipede, Has little chance of getting out of it. His almost dead victim, He takes her to a shady hiding place, To devour her in peace. Meanwhile, The chameleon goes on its way, Not without harm. Its legs are definitely not made for walking. With their opposable thumbs, They are exclusively suitable for climbing in trees. So much so that it happens to him by reflex, To grab his own legs, Mistaking them for branches. Better to give up climbing this rock, And gain a more familiar refuge. The Scorpion was not hungry enough to devour the Scolopendra entirely. He left half. A great boon for carnivorous ants, That these few centimeters of fresh flesh still alive, Nerve impulses. When one is able-bodied and equipped with such solid armor as the ****, Should we be wary of a handful of ants, Were they carnivores? May be. The **** may have the desert dragon as its nickname, He hurries off. The **** prefers to put a wall between these voracious ants and him. The **** is a cousin of the cricket. With his cuirass, He can climb thorny plants without fear, Who thrive in the desert. Usually, It is certain that no one will bother him here. But today is not his lucky day. This plant happens to be inhabited by ants, Who will naturally treat him as an intruder. The ants found his Achilles heel, The joints of his legs. As he needs all these, To keep in balance, Just bite it in turn, At all the joints to force him to decamp. We nicknamed the ****, dragon of the desert, Because of the spurs on his back. In reality, there is nothing fierce about it. He is content for food with what he finds on the way, Often dead animals, But also seeds and rotting fruits. It's a bit like the dustman of the desert, A hundred tiny attacking ones with sharp mandibles, Against this defenseless giant. The outcome of the confrontation is not in doubt, The dragon will be forced to retreat. Here he is back on his promontory, Where he can perhaps heal his wounds quietly. In the early afternoon, The heat is relentless. The ground temperature is 65-70 degrees. Everyone hides in some shady corner, Except the skink. Always on the lookout for prey. This yellow scorpion would do just fine. This time, the skink did it exactly right. He immediately cut off the scorpion's tail, Equipped with the poisonous sting. He now has it at his mercy. Access to the desert is forbidden to many plants. Only those who have special devices live there, To endure the drought, Some grasses, thorns, succulents. When you look at these plants, We can surprise all the scenes of the theater of life, From the most tender love to the most cruel war. This silver spider, Weaved a gigantic, almost invisible web. Woe to him who does not guess the trap. The chameleon, he Doesn't need to set traps. For hunting, Its number one asset is its slowness. Moving without any sudden movement, It avoids alerting its prey. Asset number two, His eyes that swivel in all directions and independently of each other, As powerful as periscopes. Add to this an extendable language, And coated with a kind of glue that does not leave insects, No chance to escape. The chameleon is sated. However, it will cause the loss of this beetle. A clytra. She could have landed on her feet and flown away. But fate has decided, To deliver it to pasture, To particularly aggressive red ants. First precaution break his wings. The clytra that feeds on corpses and excrement, Gives off a foul odor. But whatever, It is a beautiful prey and it could make people envious. It is therefore decided to put her in safety in the anthill. A team is already in place to clear the entrance. These red ants with black abdomens, Belong to a primitive order that remained insectivorous. While the ants, More evolved and living elsewhere than in the desert, Have become omnivores or vegetarians. All ants are capable of moving considerable weights, And it is well known, Their dedication to the community is exemplary. Is this a reason to be so zealous? The entrance to the anthill has been cleared, But it remains a little fair. As the biggest of the team lifts the clytra, One or two individuals dig under it, To try to enlarge the passage even further. Brought by a gust of wind or a twist of fate, This other clytra is immediately attacked by ants. She quickly understands that she has no interest in lingering on this ground. If it proves impossible to stuff the prey into the anthill, It will have to be cut up on the outside, And hoard it in small chunks. The ants are no longer within an effort. They have been struggling with this loot for almost an hour and a half. Many species of insectivorous ants are found in the desert. They always have pretty much the same type of behavior, Relatively calm when caring for the brood within the anthill, They suddenly go into hyperactivity, When it comes to changing places nymphs, Or go hunting. And very often, The discovery of an unusual prey, Plunges them into a state of extreme excitement. Especially when said prey is untransportable. Fights between individuals of the same species are frequent, And almost always have the same cause. Ants carry on them an olfactory code, A smell emitted by their queen with which they smear the antennae. And this code is different for each tribe. If two ants meet, And realize that they are enemies, It is the confrontation. These two individuals belong to a variety of giant ants, uniquely aggressive, Able to fight to death. When an ant has lost an antenna, She no longer has any sense of direction. which, sooner or later, He will be fatal. On his side, The victorious ant is unscathed. It only remains for him to erase the stains of this, Duel in the dust. If ants usually act in groups, It happens to them, it seems, To take personal initiatives, That they strive to assume until the end. This one has found a magnificent booty, The corpse of a beetle, A pimelia, that she would like to bring back to her tribe. Here are the images most often evoked by the word desert. The erg, the infinite sand dunes, Is apparently hostile to all forms of life. Yet even here A few small animals manage to survive, By staying buried under the sand during the hottest hours. So the fish of the sands with its flattened snout, Which allows him to dig. The Galeode belongs to the solifugid family. Those who run away from the sun. With its long slender legs, She runs 3 times faster than her cousin the scorpion. With the hooks she has in front of her head, She rightly impresses almost all her neighbors. These two hooks, which are called chelicerae, It also serves well to inject its venom to kill its victims, Than to dig burrows. Its legs are bristling with long sensory hairs, Who pick up the vibrations, Betraying the passage of prey or the approach of danger. This young cobra is also looking for a well shaded hole. Unable to dig a burrow himself, The cobra commonly settles in a ready-made shelter. But the galeod will not hesitate to pinch the intruder, To dissuade him from insisting. A few more minutes and the galeode, will have finished arranging his burrow. posted at the entrance, She will be able to watch for her favorite prey. Beetles, termites and arachnids of all kinds. Or to observe the comings and goings of an animal, Who competes in speed with her. The little Jerboa, One of the rare mammals living in the dunes. The jerboa uses its front legs and its teeth, To dig burrows that descend in a spiral, Up to one meter 20 deep. You can see what its long hind legs are for. Alas, Its leaping course can be interrupted, At any time by the fennec fox, his lifelong enemy. The desert hedgehog digs, Him too, Lairs where he spends most of his days. Except when he found no prey during his nocturnal hunts. He can then cover astonishing distances, To get food. A great walker and an insatiable insect eater. Butterflies, locusts, beetles and pimelies, Have no interest in crossing his path. The hedgehog also kills snakes, Galeodes and scorpions if you pass within its reach. The hardest test for all these animals, The sandstorm. insects, mammals and reptiles, Are all equal before the whims of the wind. And all obsessed with the same imperative, To shelter. This little lizard, the gecko, Is so light that a gust knocks it down like nothing, And leaves it hard to turn around. The water which In the desert is synonymous with life, Can also bring death. Nomadic shepherds and their flocks, But also wild animals, Who have access to water from wells, And risk their lives drinking it. This water is drinkable, And does not contain any toxic substances. Only, it is inhabited, By leeches. Goats have learned to be wary of leeches, And be careful not to inhale it while drinking. But the danger comes from their larvae, lowercase, Invisible. If an animal swallows one, She settles under the tongue or in her stomach, Grows and ends up killing it. Maghreb desert cacti are actually plants, Imported from Mexico which have adapted very well to this environment. They are called succulents, Because they accumulate water in their tissues. Each of them is an oasis for the insect people. We meet there the most common and also the strangest. This bizarre twig is a cricket as good at mimicry, Let the famous insects branch, Phasmids. The body of locusts is covered with a permeable integument, Which allows them to sweat, And to cool by evaporation. Thereby, They can safely be exposed to direct sunlight, Even in the hottest hours, Provided they often restore their water reserves. And since they don't drink, They must therefore eat daily, Half their weight in plants, And therefore spend long hours on their favorite plants. The cricket's disguise is his best weapon, Against possible enemies. This is why it remains absolutely motionless during the day. Except in cases of force majeure, This one got caught in a spider's web, And would like to try to get free. Here is our desert dragon again, embarking on a climbing challenge. An exercise in which he excels, moreover, Thanks to its pasta that seizes the prickles of the cactus, Like the rungs of a ladder. If the **** and the cricket have no reason to fear each other, Their meeting seizes them. against all odds, The dragon will be the cricket's lifeline. It will serve as a springboard for him to fly away. A day will come when our desert dragon can also fly. It is still in the larval state and wingless, But these will develop during its next moult. These beetles, very numerous in the desert, Are the dung beetles that lay their eggs in pellets of excrement. At the time of reproduction, They fill their burrows with droppings of all kinds, And this commotion attracts the skinks prowling around. This one is young. If he had a little more experience, He would know not to blame the dung beetle. The bitter substance they secrete makes them inedible. A few steps away, A toad from Mauritania, Instead of going to the burrow where he spends the day, Got numb from the heat. The skink will know with him, The same disappointment as with the dung beetles. Hungry and exasperated perhaps by his previous failure, The skink found nothing better to do, Than to jump on this toad, Who is not one of his usual prey. It was in truth the worst he could do. The Mauritania toad produces a poisonous liquid, Even worse than that of dung beetles. Our water point earlier seems completely dried up, Which would be catastrophic for this leprous turtle. It happens that the **** which fill up, On the occasion of a sudden waterfall, Do not dry up completely and keep here and there in their beds, Water holes called gueltas. Some of these gueltas, Only have a fairly short reprieve and eventually disappear. Others constitute permanent cisterns, Fed by springs flowing deep in the mountains, To the plains. And this is how the desert sometimes has good surprises in store for you. Even more surprising, This tiny puddle is populated by fish. Tilapias or catfish, Capable in case of drought, To survive in the wet mud and wait for better days. Near its water reservoirs, It is no longer a question of defending a territory. These beaches become, By force of circumstances, Public domain. They are the scene of numerous encounters which arouse, According to the actors, Mistrust, Hostility or total indifference. It is quite rare for a chameleon to venture ashore, Hence the toad's surprise. Neither being aggressive, They prefer to go their way without making a fuss. Our skink still hasn't satisfied its hunger. This walker could well bear the brunt of his voracity. Completely successful attack. The scorpion is mastered. The skink only has to firm up its grip, To cut off his tail. But this time, Maneuvering is not so easy, Than with the yellow scorpion the other day. The fat-tailed scorpion is much more vigorous. Let go, if only for a 10e of a second to better grasp it, Would be risking the fatal bite. If he failed to cut the poisonous sting, The skink has abused the scorpion enough, To put him out of harm's way. He will be able to swallow it, As it should be head first. The voracity of skinks has become legendary. some shepherds, Sahara nomads, Claim that they would approach their camp at night, For sucking milk from sleeping goats. They would be found in the early morning, sated, Asleep among the herds. More red ants hard at work. A major construction job, apparently. But the site being underground, We won't know any more. This yellow scorpion, a western buthus, did not choose the best place to seek shelter. He found a beautiful cave, very fresh, But alas already invested by ants. Its venomous spur can do nothing, Facing such tiny attackers. Ants, on the other hand, Bite him so badly at the joints, That he prefers to run away. second mistake, This time he put the sentinels of the anthill on alert. These red ants with black abdomens are finally, More formidable than any other predator. They attack with their mandibles, And inject into the wounds a corrosive secretion, Based on formic acid. The victim, Once eaten away by the burns, No longer offers any resistance. The scorpion, practically paralyzed, Within minutes became a helpless victim. Ants are unquestionably the queens of the desert. They form the most numerous populations, And are represented everywhere, in the stones, In the sand, In the regs, In the oases. They symbolize the extraordinary adaptability of small creatures, In the middle of the desert. Sandfish, jerboas, galeodes, Excellent in the art of taking refuge under the sand. It is in the dimension that we must seek the reason, Why all these little animals manage to survive here. Who says small size says first of all, Easier to shelter from the sun. On the other hand, the smaller we are, The less water you need. Beetles, scorpions, ants, Are coated with a kind of extremely heat-resistant wax, Which prevents them from sweating. Ants have all these advantages, More strength in numbers. So that a scorpion, One of the most dangerous species in this environment, Can die under the attacks of a crowd of individuals, 1000 times smaller than him, Thus undergoing one of the mysterious laws which govern, Life in the desert.
