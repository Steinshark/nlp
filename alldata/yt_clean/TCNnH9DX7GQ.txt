Happy to be together on &quot;Happy Together&quot;! - Hello. / - Hi. Look who's here. - Were you shocked? / - Yes. - Myungsoo... / - Yes? - Myungsoo... / - Yes? - has finally... / - We lost him? We're not restructuring the show yet. - That time has passed. / - Is it his time to leave? - Along with the conveyor belt? / - Yes. Has he left us? - Who, Myungsoo? / - Is that what you want? The conveyor belt is gone but Myungsoo will remain with us. (That's too bad) - Oh dear. / - He'll be gone only for a week. - Where did he go? / - What? - Where is he? / - He's in America. - America? / - Yes. America doesn't suit him. - He's there for work. / - Was it planned? Did he leave because he couldn't make people laugh? That's not it. People are asking if he fled Korea because of that incident. - But that's not why he left. / - I see. He'll be back next week and for the time being, Defconn will be filling in. (Defconn is the special replacement) Welcome, Defconn. - I just dropped by. / - I see. (He is hip-hop's Dakota Fanning) (He's also the Uli Stielike of variety shows) (He's at the core of KBS' outdoor variety shows) (Defconn has now joined KBS programs) I rarely accept to fill in for someone on a show - because it's too pressuring. / - I see. - I was going to refuse this job. / - But? But I can replace Myungsoo any day. It's totally doable. - That's why... / - You've been better so far. - Yes. / - Really? - Yes. / - Do you wish to stay? - Me? / - Yes. The four of you have similar-sized faces. It's really shocking. - How come... / - You're so ugly now. - There's no perspective. / - Actually... Poong should look like he's further away, but it's like you're right next to me. Let's just say we look like boulders on the side of a mountain. - We have rock faces. / - Yes. - Don't include me. / - It's true. Hyunmoo used to look cute in a way, but now... Hyunmoo, why is your face so big? - It's swollen. / - Does someone inflate your face like a balloon? - I was shocked. / - I'll burst it later. Defconn, I hope you settle in... and help us out well today. Thank you. I'll try. It's time to introduce our guests. Myungsoo is in America. Today's guests... - Are they from America? / - Yes, exactly. - We made an exchange. / - Made in USA. - They're stars from America. / - Yes. Today's guests are celebrities who conquered the Korean entertainment industry with their own American style. Please welcome, Lee Hyunwoo, Yoon Sang, John Park, Eric Nam and Stephanie Lee! (They're from the U.S.) Hello. - Hello. / - Welcome. - Hello. / - John Park. - Welcome. / - Hello there. - Hi. / - Hello. Welcome, Yoon Sang. Hello. - Yo, yo, yo. / - It's good to see you! - Nice to see you. / - It's good to see you. Is this coming loose? (Lee Hyunwoo) - Hey there, old man. / - Have a seat. Hello. (We sent Myungsoo to the U.S.) (And got five celebrities in return) (John Park is from Chicago) (Eric Nam is from Atlanta) (Lee Hyunwoo pioneered English rap) (Yoon Sang stayed in the U.S. for just a little while) (Stephanie Lee is the only woman here) I knew it. You want the big fish rather than the minions? - This is really nice. / - It's good to have you. (The studio is filled with American vibes) I like it. But Hyunwoo, did you fight with your wife? Your shirt's torn. I actually just commented on that already. This is what European commoners wore in the Middle Ages. - Really? / - Really? Did you watch the film, &quot;Braveheart&quot;? - The Middle Ages... / - Or maybe &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;? I thought the threads were coming loose. It's deliberate. Is it? I see. As I said earlier, we have five guests who are from America. They're American, but these three look trendy and those - two seem old-fashioned. / - Look at their clothes. This leads to my first question. How long have you been in Korea? - How about you, Stephanie? / - I've been here - for four years. / - How come your Korean is so good? How long did you live in America, then? I was born and raised there. You're American born and bred. And you, John? I've been here a little over five years now. - About five years? / - Yes. But John looks like he was raised here. Do I? Maybe his name is just in English. (Everyone knows someone like him) - No, I... / - Speak in English. Speak in English. Go on. Can you speak English? - To the camera. / - Introduce yourself. And I am a singer. - I got that. / - I understood that. - That wasn't impressive. / - That was simply English. I could understand everything. That's not quite... He looks like a Hongdae resident. (Hongdae resident) Eric, how long have you been here? I was born in America and lived there until I was 24, then I moved here. He looks like he's from America. Where? Where are you from? - Did you hear that? / - Atlanta? I only heard &quot;Atlanta&quot; because it's on my script. I probably wouldn't have understood. - This is real English. / - That's right. - I understood John perfectly. / - Where are you from? - I'm from Chicago. / - Yes, Chicago. Chicago. - Chicago. / - That's it? Anyone can understand that. I'd say John grew up in Korea and learned English in preschool. Maybe he attended an international school. - English Village in Paju. / - One of those schools. English Village in Paju? He's about to cry. All three people, including Stephanie, speak fluent Korean. - Right? / - Yes. Their pronunciation is very... It's very good. Yoon Sang, can you actually speak English? Yoon Sang, can you actually speak English? - Yoon Sang is... / - We should test him. Didn't you live in Korea for a long time? - If I must explain, / - Yes? - I've lived here for 35 years. / - Okay. I studied abroad for seven years and returned five years ago. You went sightseeing. So if we consider the show's theme, Yoon Sang should be on the American version of &quot;Happy Together&quot; - as a celebrity from Korea. / - That's right. - You're right. / - He can be the Korean singer. - He'll be the singer from Korea. / - That's right. You went abroad in your 30s. That's when his brain stopped functioning. Your English wouldn't improve a bit. - It must be true. / - He looks hurt already. I'm fine. I got teased so much my heart is callused. He gets hurt easily. - Does he? / - Yes. Do you have an English name? My surname is Lee, - so it's Lee Yoonsang. / - Lee Yoonsang. Yoonsang Lee. - Your full name is Lee Yoonsang? / - Yes. I'm disappointed you didn't know. I'm disappointed you didn't know. I really didn't know. We should hear his English. - We should. / - Yes. You lived in America. Don't stretch it. I really like Lovelyz's song called - &quot;Candy Jelly Love.&quot; / - You did? I was shocked to hear that you composed that. - And &quot;Ah-Choo&quot;. / - &quot;Ah-Choo.&quot; Yes, that too. (It's a song describing a girl in love) (It was composed by OnePiece) I didn't do it alone. I created a team of composers named &quot;OnePiece&quot;. - A team? / - Isn't that a cartoon? - That's... / - It's an anime. I actually got the name from that anime. Everyone in the anime - travel together in a ship. / - That's right. I thought youngsters would recognize that name. So are you Luffy from the anime, &quot;One Piece&quot;? That's what we think. (Yes, I'm the main character) Hyunwoo, can you explain why you're here? He's definitely Korean. I've lived in Korea now for 24 years. For 24 years. Without leaving the country? (In shame and glory) (He monitored the music industry for 24 long years) (He's a veteran) For 24 years. - Without leaving the country? / - Yes. I lived in America for about 10 years. Now I understand! They're sitting in order. It's in ascending order of the number of years that they spent in America. - Since their return. / - You've lived there the least. Yes, it's been a while. Now I understand. Hyunwoo still has an American accent though. It's the pronunciation. Compared to the dance music that's popular in Korea, I focus more on urban music or soul. I prefer music with a powerful rhythm. Are you showing off? - I learned English in New York. / - New York? - Their pronunciation is rigid. / - It is. They sometimes skip the &quot;R&quot; sound. When others say &quot;New York&quot;, the &quot;R&quot; is pronounced. New Yorkers don't pronounce the &quot;R&quot;. - Eric, is he right? / - Yes, he is. - It's... / - How do you say &quot;New York&quot;? - New York. / - That's it. That's how you're supposed to say it. What's wrong with you? Some people would think it's strange, but if you watch Robert Di Niro's... - &quot;Di Niro&quot;? / - &quot;The Italian&quot;... Isn't it De Niro? - Yes, it's De Niro. / - Who's Di Niro? Robert De Niro. - You forced me to exaggerate. / - You said &quot;Di Niro&quot;. - So... / - &quot;De Niro.&quot; - Go on. / - Italian-Americans speak in this accent. It sounded so new and I liked it. I copied that accent. That's how I ended up with an odd English dialect. He has an unusual English name, too. - What is it? / - Isn't your English name, Jesse? - Jesse. / - Jesse? - Jesse? / - Hip-hopper Jessie? Jesse Lee in the house, yo. What did he say? Jesse's at home. - Jesse's at home. / - Isn't Jesse a powerful name? It's a strong hip-hop name. There was a famous gunslinger named Jesse James. - He was infamous, not famous. / - That's right. I thought it would be a fun name to use. And that's why? I just went with it. - What about you, Stephanie? / - Stephanie? My name is pronounced Stephanie. - Stephanie. / - Stephanie? - And... / - Stephanie. - Stephanie. / - Stephanie. Koreans shorten my name to &quot;Panie&quot;. Yes, we say, &quot;Hey Panie!&quot; - Yes, like that. / - &quot;Hey, Panie.&quot; - &quot;It's been a while, Panie.&quot; / - &quot;Panie, Panie.&quot; Americans shorten it to &quot;Steph&quot; or &quot;Steffi&quot;. - Oh, in America? / - But... - Here that means &quot;staff&quot;. / - Yes. Whenever someone called for the staff or crew, I ran up to them. &quot;Where's the staff?&quot; &quot;Here I am.&quot; I had issues with my name, too. Like what? Originally, it's John Park. Koreans say &quot;Jon Bak&quot;. Koreans say &quot;Jon Bak&quot;. (It feels so traditional) &quot;Jon Bak.&quot; Mr. Jon Bak. That's so... - Over there... / - We say... Please welcome, Jon Bak! Jon Bak. So it should be John Park. - John Park. / - John Park. That's right. It should be John Park. It sounded so unfamiliar. They hardly pronounce &quot;N&quot; sound properly, so I thought my name would end up being &quot;Jom Bak&quot;. - &quot;Jom Bak&quot;? / - With the &quot;M&quot; sound? It means a moth-eaten gourd. - Jom bak, the moth-eaten gourd. / - Moth-eaten gourd. - And... / - Jom Bak... Stephanie just said that people call her &quot;Panie&quot; for short. Some people call me &quot;Baki-ya&quot;. - &quot;Baki-ya.&quot; / - &quot;Baki-ya.&quot; &quot;Baki-ya.&quot; I see. &quot;Baki-ya&quot; is fine, but then there's &quot;Baka.&quot; Come here &quot;Baka&quot;. That sounds very... - I didn't like it at all. / - Oh dear. Is Korean English pronunciation difficult? Was that ever an issue? There were lots of difficulties. - For example? / - Even now... Hot dog. - Hot dogs. / - Hot dogs. I don't know if I should say &quot;hot dog&quot; or &quot;hat dog&quot;. When I go to America nowadays, I use Korean pronunciation. &quot;Can I have a salod&quot;? - I get stared at. / - How should you say it? &quot;Can I have a salad&quot;? - I went with my mom. / - It's pronounced &quot;salad&quot;. And she laughed while watching me order. She told me that I pronounced &quot;salod&quot; like a Korean. I was pronouncing &quot;tomato&quot;, &quot;salad&quot;, &quot;cola&quot; with an accent. How would you order them in America? - Wow. / - Wow. - &quot;Tomato.&quot; / - &quot;Tomato&quot;? When we go back and forth Korea and America, we sometimes get the languages mixed up. Back when it was still possible to smoke in restaurants, my friend who speaks English like a native once said, &quot;Geterly please.&quot; &quot;Geterly please.&quot; - Geterly? / - He meant an ashtray. He meant an ashtray. &quot;Geterly please.&quot; &quot;Geterly please.&quot; (Who is his friend?) He's so funny. - You're so funny today. Why are you so funny today? Why are you so funny today? - Am I funny? / - Yes. - I'm embarrassed. / - You are so funny. - He's a rising star. / - He truly is. - It's the sweater. / - Yes. I need to buy that sweater. - We all need to buy that. / - We'll wear it together. All right. We interviewed them prior to shooting. We told Stephanie about today's guests. She said John is amazing because he was runner-up on &quot;Superstar K&quot;. She complimented him. So she recognized John right away. She described Eric as a K-pop star who's famous abroad. That's what she said about him. With Hyunwoo and Yoon Sang, she said, &quot;Who are they?&quot; That's understandable. - They're old. / - Stephanie, you don't know them very well, right? - I saw him on &quot;Infinite Challenge&quot;. / - Where? - During the music festival special? / - Yes. - He was on &quot;Infinite Challenge&quot;. / - That's right. How about Hyunwoo? He looks familiar, but I don't know him. - That's all right. / - He's a singer. You said &quot;That's all right&quot;, but your face turned red. I'm bad at hiding my feelings. (I can't hide my feelings well) - It's my age, too. / - Your age? Your sweater is very revealing. - So your whole neck is red. / - Your neck is red, too. - This is crazy. / - Gosh. Gosh. They are the five people who took over the Korean entertainment industry with their American style. John looks like a typical Korean-American man. But many people are confused about his real personality. - That's right. / - Is he really funny? In variety shows, he's known to be really funny. He's the rising star in the variety program industry. But you look very different as a singer. We can't figure it out. Which is the real you? (He has a sweet voice) (That resonates from somewhere deep inside) (But) (He loses himself whenever he gets on variety shows) He looks like an animated character. It's hard to say that they ask him to do this. If they asked him to do it, he would've surprised them. - That's right. / - These are his three famous faces. - Yes. / - Did you get trained to do this? No, I don't think I'm normal. - Right? / - Yes. I think I'm a bit odd. I love doing odd things. This is John's personality, too. He has a goofy side of him that is pulled out at will. During the break time, he seems normal. He was our guest on &quot;One Night Two Days&quot;. When the shoot began, he stuck out his tongue. He went like this. - No way. / - Wow! - He's like that. / - No way. - He's a natural celebrity. / - I can't go around - sticking out my tongue. / - That's right. - Like this. / - That's right. - He's really something. / - It's just not attractive. - I'm serious. / - When I'm on a shoot, I get goofy. - Yes, people like it. / - People feel comfortable. He's a professional. - I'm not at that level yet. / - You're a professional. Eric is famous for being an interviewer. Eric's an amazing guy. He's interviewed unbelievable people. Robert Downey, Jr., Jamie Foxx and - Barbara Palvin. / - Barbara Palbun? Palbun? - Who's that? It's Barbara Palvin. / - I meant Palvin. - He interviewed Tang Wei. / - He met many celebrities. - He's famous among them. / - Paris Hilton was another. When I was on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, I interviewed global stars in broken English. I asked her if I look like George Clooney. - Do I look like George Clooney? / - Sure. (He tricked Keanu Reeves, too) - And for another instance... / - Yes? Usually, Hollywood stars only spare us five to six minutes. So we talk about kimchi, Yuna Kim, Park Jisung or Gangnam Style. After that they just say, &quot;I love you, Entertainment Weekly&quot;. - That's it. / - You're exaggerating. I'm serious though. - There's no time. / - You don't get much time. I don't get much time. Their managers pressure you. - After it's time, they go, &quot;Out!&quot; / - You did well. But in that time, Eric befriended them on social media. - That's how interested they were. / - Eric's amazing. Usually you get five minutes to interview, but he extends it to 15 minutes. That happened when he interviewed Jamie Foxx. - Jamie Foxx? / - He spent 15 minutes with him. - Wow. / - Wow. - Oh! / - Oh! - &quot;Young man&quot;... / - That's what he wrote? You only read &quot;I met a young man&quot;. - &quot;As well&quot;. / - You met him on Saturday. - Jamie posted this. / - What's this? That was a five minute interview. - That was a five minute interview. / - But? I went to LA for it and I only got five minutes. The director told me to get as much as I could. Otherwise, our trip was going to be meaningless. The plane tickets must've been really expensive. I was really stressed going into the interview. But he was so kind throughout it. At the end, I asked him about Korean music. I told him that I was a singer myself. Then he got really excited and asked me to sing for him. So I sang him a song called &quot;Heaven's Door&quot;. He loved it and even sang it with me. He even asked me to work with him. He got my number and followed me on social media. He asked his assistant to take a video of us and posted it online. But when I realized it, we spent more than 15 minutes. - So... / - Will you release an album there? - Will it go on the Billboard Chart? / - I don't know. - When was that interview? / - I don't know. Did it happen last year? - It was two years ago. / - Two years ago? - Then, it's over. / - Yes, it is. - It's over. / - Jamie forgot. - Jamie forgot. / - He must be very busy. Many of my model friends that I work with in New York - really like him. / - Really? - They like Eric? / - Yes, he's a popular star. When they hear the word K-pop, they immediately think of Eric Nam. - He represents K-pop? / - Wow. - Does anyone mention John? / - There's John Park, too. - Does anyone mention John? / - There's John Park, too. - Nobody? / - I like you. (I like you) - She's so considerate. / - Yes, she is. I heard you stole a pillow for Noel Gallagher. Do you even know who Noel Gallagher is? Isn't she a foreign actress? Gosh, you are... He's a famous guitarist. He's a member of Oasis. You don't know the legendary group, Oasis? I don't even know Hyunwoo well. - He will get upset. / - Are you getting upset again? (He's turning red) - Control your feelings. / - I chose the wrong outfit. You should go get changed. - The sweater reveals your feelings. / - I know, right? That sweater reveals your feelings. I'm shy, so I get embarrassed easily. (You're shy?) I'm shy, so I get embarrassed easily. People might actually believe him. You're not shy. - Do you know any Hollywood stars? / - Anyone? I had several chances to interview Hollywood stars. It was a program from the Seoul Broadcasting Station. (The Seoul Broadcasting Station?) - Seoul Broadcasting Station. / - You mean SBS? - Yes. / - Seoul Broadcasting Station! Who calls it that these days? - Gosh. / - Why do you still call it that? Wasn't that like 25 years ago? Seoul Broadcasting Station, Munhwa Broadcasting Station and Korea Broadcasting Station. I don't like using acronyms. - I think it's strange. / - I see. Go on. - Anyway, / - This is funny. I went to the Tokyo Dome to interview Whitney Houston. But that day, she was feeling ill that she cancelled the interview. So I just watched the performance and Denzel Washington starred in this one movie. I flew to New York to interview him. - He cancelled, too. / - What? So I just ended up traveling the whole time. That's why you are grateful to Seoul Broadcasting System. He has no luck. Do you have any famous friends, Stephanie? Just recently, I met the Taiwanese actress, Shu Qi. - Shu Qi! / - I met her yesterday. - I met her yesterday. / - She's very pretty. - Yesterday? / - You met her yesterday? - Yes. / - Where? - She's so beautiful. / - She's still the same, right? - She's still the same, right? / - What did you say? - Have you met her before? / - Do you know her? - I've seen her a lot on video. / - On &quot;video&quot;? By the way, you're sitting where Myungsoo usually sits. But why are you so big? (Why are you so big?) - He's right there. / - I can't see his face well. - You can't see his entire face. / - I really can't. I can't see his entire face. - Yes. / - Shu Qi is a nice one. Let's talk about Stephanie. she was a scene-stealer of the &quot;The Gang Doctor&quot;. - Cynthia. / - You watched it? - I watched it. / - Did you really? Cynthia. Do you feel your popularity these days? Yes, it's totally different. I used to only model. - And just recently... / - She's known for commercials. - That's how she became famous. / - It made her famous. Please don't make me do it. Yoon Sang, you know that advertisement, right? I don't, so I'd like to see it. Then you have to show him. - It's really famous. / - Could you do it? - You were a scene-stealer. / - Yes, she was. Show us. Deep clean foaming cleanser from Neutrogena. &quot;From...&quot; &quot;From Neutrogena.&quot; - &quot;From&quot; is important. / - &quot;From&quot;. You can't hide your feelings, can you? Isn't it hot in here? (Excited) It seems like you've great blood circulation today. He has great blood circulation. That does seem like a magical shirt. He might film an ad for blood circulation pills. - He seems healthy. / - What are you talking about? He does have great blood circulation. I heard you started living as Cynthia even before the shooting began. (Did she really live as Cynthia before the shooting?) Say hi to her. / This is Cynthia. Sir. It's Cynthia Park. That's how you're supposed to pronounce it. Yes, Cynthia. I haven't been acting for a long time. I felt like I was falling short. So I decided to live every day with Cynthia's clothes and makeup. - Because of the character? / - Yes. I was dressed like her when I hung out with my friends. - I heard so. / - You lived as Cynthia. I told my friends to call me Cynthia instead of Stephanie. - Cynthia. / - That's the correct pronunciation. Cynthia. Since I'm a model, I wanted Cynthia to have her own walk, too. I didn't do a model's walking, though. - Cynthia had her own thing. / - Could you show us? - Right here? / - Yes. - Yes. / - It must be different. - Cynthia walks differently. / - Wow. - She is... / - She's slender. - She's slender. / - From what we thought... Could you stay silent? (Neighborhood guy) - It was an observation. / - My goodness. - That was funny. / - I heard you pronounced Korean like a Korean-American, too. Yes, something like that. How did you pronounce it? One of the lines said &quot;In or out&quot; and I exaggerated it to sound like this - as if I had a voice recorder. / - How? In or out. / I exaggerated my pronunciation. In or out. I think he can do this better than her. In or out. - In or out. / - That's it. He's accurate. - I was expecting that. / - Do we sound different? - Yes, you sounded different. / - It's the same. (Why are you all picking on me?) I thought you were speaking Chinese. A model should never sway their hips. - Really? / - So it's rather stiff. - You're right. / - I've seen that. That's how models walk. That's how models walk. That's how models walk. - How did she walk? / - She's sexy and uses her hips. How so? (Cynthia uses her hips to walk sexy) - How so? / - Like this. Like this. (Her expression changed, too) Like this (He's in love with her) She is confident. Her walking is very beautiful. - It's awesome. / - I'm your fan. Did he just say, &quot;I'm your fan&quot;? Awesome, you are awesome. Look at him. What's wrong? This is really fun. (I'm happy) Are you here as an audience? &quot;I'm your fan.&quot; That was really funny. - I'm your fan. / - A big fan. (We do put his shirt into consideration, but) Why is your face so red? Honestly, I was in a warm country for ten days. I got sunburned. I wore a T-shirt, so I only got burnt above my neck. T-shirt? You're from America. How can you pronounce T-shirt like that? T-shirt, man (Jesse Lee, born in 1968, was infamous gunman of Korea) T-shirt, all right? - &quot;All right?&quot; / - Only my face was burnt. T-shirt, man. Hyunwoo is actually the man who invented the emotionless acting which Jang Suwon is now famous for. - He played an executive director a lot. / - He is. - Emotionless acting. / - Isn't that right, Yoon Sang? - A master of emotionless acting. / - He's prehistoric. - Yes. / - Many people say that. This started back in Munhwa Broadcasting. (Did Hyunwoo say that again?) This started back in Munhwa Broadcasting. Stop that. He may start calling EBS as KBS 3TV. I began my career there in a TV show - &quot;Rooftop Room Cat&quot;. / - I remember. Aren't you coming into work a little too late? What do you do on weekends if you don't watch a movie? (Troubled) (Regretting) That's when I got cast as the executive director. No one ever taught me how to act at that time and I started to act out of nowhere, too. &quot;There's this executive director role in our drama&quot; &quot;I think it'll be a perfect match with you, Hyunwoo.&quot; &quot;You don't even need to act. The lines are short, too.&quot; Goodness, it was a drama. - &quot;You don't need to act.&quot; / - What will he do? &quot;You can just do this as how you are normally.&quot; So I took the role. I did lack many things back then because it was my first time. But I started to like shooting dramas. - After the drama, / - He didn't know he'd like it. I started getting panic attacks. - Really? / - Seriously? And I couldn't get myself out of that character. - It was your first show? / - You were really into it. You did the method approach. I really got into my character. - Really? / - Nobody thought I'd do that. - Even after the drama ended, / - Did something happen? I felt like my role as an executive director had to go on for longer. I wanted to meet my fellow actors and keep acting. But the story ended and I became depressed that I didn't want to go out. That really happens. (Amazed) Whenever I talk about this, people would laugh. Honestly, your acting wasn't that great. (You acted poorly) - You aren't Choi Minsik. / - It's like this. We, as viewers couldn't get into his character. - But he was into it. / - He was in his own world. - I was like Health Ledger. / - You were absorbed. (What were his lines like?) What did the executive director character usually say? This is what I did. I need to go back into the office and work and I need to eat dinner before work. But I don't have anyone else to dine with. Do you want to eat? - Did you just act? / - Was that acting? It felt like I was watching a drama. - He asked if I wanted to eat. / - Do you want to eat? Anyways, my mother really liked that drama. She called me and said, &quot;How come you're the only one not acting?&quot; (He's an immersion disturbance) She wanted me to be immersed into the acting. She asked me to show a different side of the character. I told her, &quot;That character is what people want.&quot; I was delusional at the time. Yoon Sang, not only are you working as a songwriter, - you're in variety shows, too. / - He's really funny. He also shot many ads and now he's the best student of Mr. Baek. - He cooks, too. / - Isn't that right? I improved a lot. - You did, didn't you? / - He improved a lot. How bad were you before? I never really cooked in the kitchen before. You couldn't even make ramen. I cooked ramen. I was a type to brag about doing that. Now, I can make a variety of stews and soups just as how I'd like them. (The master of home cooking) Just as how he likes them. I went to America because my family is still there and I cooked for them. They said it was delicious. In December, my family will come visit me. I'm planning to cook every meal for them. - That's amazing. / - Men who can cook are awesome. - To be honest, the original / - You're right. celebrity chef was Hyunwoo. - Yes. / - You're right. He was the original celebrity chef. Back then, I thought, &quot;Why would he live like that?&quot; - That's what I thought. / - That's how you thought? I thought he was putting on an act. I was immature at that time. Hyunwoo, you can't hide your feelings again. (Showing his emotion through the tip of his shirt) - Can you tell? / - Yes, I can. - Oh, man. / - Hyunwoo is also famous for hosting a radio show for a long time. He's famous for reading stories without emotions. I think that's because he is the creator of emotionless acting. I heard radio listeners know all about his style. Reading comments without emotion. If you aren't careful, you may think he's a cyborg. I listen to his radio show from time to time and I do agree. Hyunmoo, you're famous for reading without emotion. He's worse than I am. His last words on the radio are the most soulless. &quot;Let's love Hyunmoo tomorrow, too.&quot; When he says those lines, - he's just... / - I thought he was a machine. - Is that a recording? / - I've been on his show. He says those last lines with his cell in his hands. It's just work for you. I try to put in feelings when I read stories, though. When I heard him on the radio, there's this one line that I remember. Someone hurt their hand while peeling an apple. It said, &quot;Hyunwoo, comfort me.&quot; &quot;She must have hurt her hand while peeling an apple.&quot; &quot;It must hurt.&quot; (Act like a machine after reading) - He's trying to... / - What is that? I make mistakes often when I'm on the radio. Have you done it recently? This was a day before yesterday. Albe comes out weekly as a guest. - You mean Alberto, right? / - Yes. I was talking to him and I suddenly called him Abe. (Abe) - Was your guest Abe Shinzo? / - Abe is Japanese. - Gosh, this is too much. / - All of a sudden I was only missing the &quot;L&quot; and it completely changed. It's completely different. Abe and Albe are completely different. I make those kinds of mistakes often. Today's episode is &quot;I'm from America.&quot; Let's listen to what their life was like in America. - Let's listen to their stories. / - I'm curious. Stephanie, I heard you owned the fashion scene in New York. - Tell us about it. / - I wouldn't say I owned it. I began my career at the age of 16. - As a model? / - Yes. - Let's see some pictures. / - Let's see them. Stephanie captured the hearts of New Yorkers. Wow. - You were 16 here? / - I was 16 at that time. - You're so cool. / - You look different. It looks like someone slapped you. (Slapped on both sides) - Both cheeks, too. / - She got slapped so badly - that it's sticking out. / - Your cheeks are swollen. It's amazing she can pull off those unique clothes. - May I ask how tall you are? / - I'm 177 cm. - What's your proportion? / - You are 177? - What's your proportion? / - She's a nine-head figure. - A nine-head figure? / - Wow. - How can someone be like that? / - There aren't many. - It's very rare. / - Well, Defconn is - about a four-head figure. / - Or a five-head figure. - What did you say? / - You're like an anime character. - I shouldn't be included. / - I think you should be. My height is about five-head figure. You shouldn't laugh. You're like that too. (You shouldn't be laughing) You shouldn't laugh. You're like that too. - That's why I'm staying quiet. / - That's right. - He's worse than me. / - Defconn. Could you stand next to Stephanie for a brief moment? - Gosh. / - Just for a brief moment. - Go stand next to her. / - Just for a brief moment. I want to compare your proportion to hers. - Let's compare their proportions. / - But I thought... Let's compare their proportions. Defconn looks like a cartoon character. (A butterfly approaches a big boulder) - Goodness! / - Oh! My goodness. There's a big difference in the size of their faces. - Step forward. / - Should I step forward? - Yes, yes. / - Where does his face end? Gosh, Stephanie is already... Your face is just half the size of Defconn's. - Is that right? / - Who is the abnormal one? Please use computer graphic to find out exactly how proportionate I am. His head comes all the way down to his shoulders. (Stephanie is nine-heads tall) (Defconn is nearly six-heads tall) (Defconn is ill-proportioned) - How tall are you again? / - I'm 177 cm. But how come her waist comes up to my chest? (Her waist is exactly where his chest is) - This is where my chest is. / - How is that possible? Please come back to your seats now. (I shouldn't be laughing right now) Gosh, looking at someone who has a nine-head figure... - Seriously. / - By the way, - your face suits... / - People like her really exist. - It suits your body, Defconn. / - I totally agree. I'm serious. Different things suit different people. By the way, I want to ask Stephanie how she became a fashion model. - I grew up on an island. / - I see. - Boston. You know, right? / - Yes. I lived on an island and - I didn't know fashion at all. / - Then what happened? And my friends used to tease me - by telling me that I was ugly. / - Seriously? They said that I'm ugly and tall, so I should become a model. So I said, &quot;What does that have&quot; &quot;anything to do with modeling?&quot; It didn't start out as a compliment, but I got to know about modeling through that. So I started looking into training programs - and just went to New York one day. / - Really? - I heard it was quite dramatic. / - I heard that too. I went by myself and said, &quot;I want to be a model.&quot; - I told them that. / - Wow. And coincidentally, - Tyra Banks happened to be there. / - Tyra Banks! Wow. - Wow, wow. / - Yes, and there were many other famous people. - I recognized her right away. / - Yes. I was like, &quot;Goodness, this is so cool.&quot; She saw me, too. She was working as a photographer then and she said that she wanted to take photos of me. She told me that I look very exotic and pretty. After she said that, one of the managers at the agency noticed me and wanted me to sign a contract right away. So I ended up working on that day. - Right on that day? / - Yes. - That's so fast. / - Then I signed a contract, too. That's the story. Goodness, this is something you see in dramas. - Totally. / - These things can actually happen. - It's very unrealistic. / - I can't believe it. We heard Stephanie's story. - Now, it's Eric's turn. / - Yes. I heard that he always did so well in school. This exam is like America's college entrance exam. I heard that you got 750 out of 800 on the SAT. - He's so smart. / - It's not that impressive. You know what I mean, right? - You only got two questions wrong? / - That's amazing. - Yes, that's right. / - That's very impressive. No, no. Then were you hoping to get a job at a big global company? - I was hired. / - Where? It was a consulting firm, D Consulting. - Gosh. / - It's hard to get in there. I worked in strategic planning. - Consulting... / - When he was on the audition show, Lee Seunghwan and I took him out and told him seriously. He told me what his annual salary was. - It was a lot, wasn't it? / - It was quite high. Considering that he just started working there. But he decided to come to Korea for the audition. If you don't mind me asking, how much was it roughly? Was in five or six figures? - In dollars. / - Yes. - In Korean won? / - I think - it was about 100,000 dollars. / - Wow. - When you got hired? / - That was your first salary? - 10,000 dollars? / - It was over 10,000 dollars. - I told him to think it over. / - Of course. Yes, but he's also a great singer. His parents must've had high expectations. So I brought it up to him carefully, but his mind was already set and he was determined. - He's doing a good job. / - If he stayed in the - company, he'd be making a lot more now. / - Also, he speaks four languages. He is fluent in Spanish, Chinese, Korean and English. - He's very impressive. / - He's good at everything. You're fluent enough to introduce yourself in Spanish, right? Yes, I can. Are you as fluent as a native speaker? I used to be able to talk like a native speaker. I traveled to South America a lot to volunteer - all throughout high school. / - You must be a genius. I'm not a genius. I picked up the language when I lived there. Please introduce yourself to us. - In Spanish. / - Hello, everyone. (Eric Nam is introducing himself in Spanish) (&quot;Korea&quot;, talking away in his fluent Spanish) - Wow. / - That was awesome. - Thank you! / - Thank you! - He's very impressive. / - I agree. - Korean, English... / - You sound attractive. - His Spanish is impressive. / - Thank you. - Were you also the class president? / - Is that right? I was the vice president of the student council. My parents put me in a private school, but things were so different. Understanding and communicating with other kids wasn't easy but I knew I was good at music and studying. So I decided to focus on these two things. I was determined to try my best to do better than other students, so I worked really hard on it. Then other students started recognizing me and acknowledged that I was good at those things. - You worked hard on it. / - Yes. I heard there was a big economic status difference. - This school is special. / - It's a private school. I always felt sorry when I thought of my parents. I couldn't tell them that I didn't want to go to that school. After immigrating, they worked hard to make money to send me there. But for other students at that school, buying expensive cars was not a big deal and they lived in houses that had elevators. Hold on. How old were they when they bought their first car? In America, kids can have their first car when they turn 15. - Is that right? / - They bought imported cars? - Did they buy a German brand? / - That car brand. Yes, they drove those cars. They had those cars at the age of 15? - Yes. / - That's unbelievable. - I couldn't understand it. / - I wouldn't have either. - But all houses have elevators, no? / - Is that so? There's an elevator in my apartment building. They had a private elevator inside their house. - Inside the house? / - They use it inside their house. It's used to go to the second floor and they have swimming pools, too. - Wow. / - A swimming pool in a house... Is that the norm? - No. / - It's only at that school. It was considered as the norm at that school, but overall, it's extremely privileged. There were only kids from extremely wealthy families. I struggled to get into the school, so it was difficult. - They're not desperate at all. / - That's right. When I first entered the school, - I was the only Asian there. / - I see. So, someone spit on my face when I was in middle school. - That's crazy. / - I was extremely shocked. They were all kids from extremely rich families, so I couldn't communicate with them and also experienced racial discrimination. It really infuriated me and stressed me out. - That's mean. / - It's very mean. - Did you not say anything? / - You didn't fight? I didn't do anything. - Fighting wouldn't have helped. / - But still... - But they bothered you. / - Come to think of it, I think that other people here could also have experienced things like this in the past. When you live in America, I think that things like this can happen no matter which area you live in. In my case, I lived on an island, so I was the only non-Caucasian person. - Really? / - I guess there were no Asians. There were no people of other colors. There were only Caucasians. So - you know those lockers, right? / - Yes. I was standing in front of my locker. - A piece of metal is at the door. / - That's right. Then someone pushed me and pretended that it was just a mistake as if I weren't there. - Goodness. / - Gosh. She was like, &quot;Oops.&quot; - Was it a girl? / - What? - She said, &quot;Oops&quot;? / - Yes. She said, &quot;Oops.&quot; And I banged my head on the locker. - I still have a scar here. / - I see. - I'm hiding it with makeup. / - We can't see it. - It looks like Harry Potter... / - You remember it. - Yes, I remember it clearly. / - Didn't she say sorry? - Didn't she apologize? / - She said &quot;Oops.&quot; - That was it? / - She just said, &quot;Oops&quot;. - I couldn't say anything. / - That's so mean. You should've just hit her in the face when she said &quot;Oops.&quot; Why are you trying to hit me? You should've hit her like this. You totally should've hit her. Did you experience it too, John? There are swear words people use - for Asians. / - Goodness. - Chink? / - Yes, expressions like that. - Which one is it? / - Oh? There are words like chink and gook. - Words like those two... / - They are mean. They're not nice. I was in the bathroom and someone called me that. So, I - hit him. / - Nice! - He deserved to be hit. / - Good job. - Great job. / - They need to learn a lesson. I hit him and ran away. - Good job. / - Good job on that one, too. - Good job. / - Great work. My generation is way before them. I immigrated to America in 1980 and back then... - That's when the riot took place. / - I was... Right, the riot took place... You know the human rights activist, right? It was only 10 years after Martin Luther King passed away. I also lived in a town where only Caucasians lived. My case was similar. That's where I first lived in America. They probably thought I looked weird because there were no Asians. There's this thing called spitball. Kids chew pieces of papers and shoot them using empty pens as straws. I would be sitting in class and my classmates would keep shooting at me. I did a lot of that too. The worse thing was the teacher didn't say anything when he obviously knew about it. - I see. / - No one would help me. You must've felt so lonely. They kept doing that throughout the class. Later on, I couldn't stand it anymore, so I went up to him and hit his head with my backpack. After that incident, words got out and kids who were troublemakers wanted to be friends with me. So they started gathering around me wanting to hear my stories about winning fights. But at the time, Bruce Lee was pretty much the only Asian public figure that was known to - teenagers in America. / - He was well-known. Right, he was well-known in America. So, as a joke, I said to them that I was Bruce Lee's grandson. I see because you're Jesse Lee. - That's right. / - I see. - Jesse Lee. / - He has the same last name. My last name is Lee, too. - That's really... / - While doing those moves, I'd say my grandpa's Bruce Lee. The whole school eventually heard that. After that, I became some sort of a hero. So wherever I went, the kids would treat me very well. It was really hard keeping that a secret until high school. They must still think you're Bruce Lee's grandson. They still probably do, but fortunately, I moved to a new neighborhood for high school. I ended up not meeting them again. Anyway, through these kind of experiences, - you also... / - You know, there's a saying, &quot;Rough roots yield good fruits&quot;. I think you can think of it that way. - What are you saying? / - That was so uncreative. - That was so uncreative that... / - That's... - I actually felt sleepy. / - No, but I meant... It's like saying, &quot;You need to eat when you're hungry.&quot; - &quot;It's cold in the winter.&quot; / - It was meaningless. - Don't forget your past efforts. / - That's right. You received your MBA and you're very talented. How did you end up being a singer? Did you keep pursuing your dream? Singing and cooking are my ways of relieving stress. I think that's how I relieved my stress. As for the singing, I kept uploading videos on YouTube. He applied to &quot;Star Audition: The Great Birth&quot; and came in top five. After work, I was so exhausted I really wanted to sing. Why don't you sing Taeyang's &quot;Wedding Dress&quot; for us? - Show us. / - I don't remember the lyrics. - How about something else? / - What else? (&quot;Eyes, Nose, Lips&quot; by Taeyang) 'Touch my skin your head down to your toes' 'It's like you're standing right in front of me now' 'Though the light's gone darker now' 'You've just gone way too far' 'I'll keep you in my heart' 'Though it kills me to say it now' 'Baby, I'll get over you' (Eric Nam) - Wow. / - 'Baby, it kills' - He's really good. / - He sings the same as before. - It's almost... / - It's the same. - His expressions... / - He's not wearing his glasses. - He sounds like Chris Brown. / - It's so good. With so many talents, aren't you underestimated as a mere reporter? Didn't that bother you? For a while, that was really sad and disappointing. It was difficult. I came here because I wanted to sing, but I worked as a reporter for a year and a half. Maybe a year. - I would've kept going. / - You were so good at it. So at first, I really hated it and wanted to quit. But as I kept doing it, I realized that it had benefits as well. I learned a lot of things, so I'm grateful. John is amazing, too. He was a top two competitor on &quot;American Idol&quot;. I watched him on &quot;American Idol&quot; and was so glad. Because as an Asian, he was either the first or the second contestant. I think you went the furthest. - He was ranked the highest. / - I was back then. When I met him for the first time, I was so glad to see him. It was like meeting a celebrity. - Why did you apply? / - Did you want to be a singer? I used to make music as a hobby, like Eric. But a college friend told me that he was going to an audition for &quot;American Idol&quot;. I just followed him there. I followed him there, but he got eliminated in the preliminary round. - That always happens. / - You made it, but he didn't. I moved up to the third preliminary round. - I appeared on TV. / - You made it to the top 20? As soon as you were eliminated from the top 20, you were contacted by the Korean auditioning program. Yes, after a few months. How are they? Are the audition programs in America and Korea different? How are they different? - There's a huge difference. / - In what ways? - It feels the same. / - The formats are the same. &quot;American Idol&quot; only shoots twice a week. - What? / - Two days. - One for rehearsals and interviews. / - That's it. - That's a short time. / - Is that it? - It ends in three hours. / - Wow. - The shoot ends that soon? / - Yes. On broadcasting day, you arrive in the morning for - the rehearsals and it ends. / - That's really brief. - This show itself takes six hours. / - That's right. In Korea, the film crew follows me to the shower. - So, it's... / - People get curious. So it's really tiring. There's mental stress, too. - You can't rest. / - Yes, you can't rest. If you ask, &quot;Can I take a break?&quot; they say, &quot;Sure, go ahead&quot;. (You take a break while I'll keep working) - Right, the red lamp's on. / - Wait, I mean... &quot;Director, I need a break.&quot; Then he says, &quot;That's okay. Just be comfortable.&quot; If you ask, &quot;Can I smoke?&quot;, he says, &quot;Sure, go ahead.&quot; - &quot;I need to go to the bathroom.&quot; / - &quot;Yes, go ahead.&quot; - They don't really do that. / - Oh, yes. - He doesn't lower the camera. / - They don't lower it. - He doesn't lower the camera. / - In America, people just want to watch people singing. They want to judge people based on that alone. In Korea, other things matter. too. Honestly, there are some of those things. People want to hear about the person's life. A back story is needed... - To empathize... / - Yes, to empathize. - Koreans like stories. / - Yes. I realized those kind of things are important. - I... / - America doesn't do that? Only celebrity enthusiasts - care about private lives. / - That's right. Another difference is... There isn't a one-of-a-kind search engine. You can't use search keywords. - No identifying keywords? / - No top keywords. - No real-time hot issues? / - Nothing like that. - Doesn't America have those? / - No. - Is that true, Stephanie? / - No, there aren't. So you have to either look those up yourself or you read what comes up on social media. If you're the winner of &quot;American Idol&quot;, doesn't your name come up? There's nothing like that. - Not at all? That's harsh. / - No. - Are there no top keywords? / - No top keywords. I feel like you'd have those new phrases with the arrows going up. Since there are so many people with diverse ways of living, the national - interest... / - There was Internet back then? - PC networks? / - I heard there were no computers. - It's when the Internet just began. / - What? - There were these movements. / - Right, yes. You're around the same age as Bill Gates. - So... / - You should just be quiet. - Bill Gates... / - You... - They cannot be compared. / - With or without the Internet, it's their culture. - So that's how it is. / - There's no unified interest. Unless there's something like a terrorist attack, people are all interested in different things. In Korea, it's essential to know things. Yes, because you can't have a conversation otherwise. Even as this show is aired, your names should be in the top keywords. - It's troubling otherwise. / - If no one's on the list - that makes it difficult for us. / - That's true. Something needs to come up like &quot;Hyunwoo's sweater&quot;. We need to have something like that. - If it's the top keywords... / - &quot;Hyunwoo's sweater.&quot; - We need these to come up. / - Those three will. - That's right. / - Eric. John said it already, but Stephanie, did you feel the differences between America and Korea while working as a model? I think the preparation time is very different. - Really? How is it in the America? / - Yes. I would arrive three hours before the show to get my hair and makeup done, then rehearse for an hour. And after the rehearsal ends, the show starts five minutes after. - That's quick. / - That's a short time. Here, it takes longer. They call us in the morning. - Since the morning. / - For us, once it's 7 p.m., - we gather from 8 a.m. and wait. / - That's right. All day long. There was actually something I liked about that. At first, I was like, why is the waiting time so long? It was so tiring, so it made me exhausted. But there was fun in that. In America, since it's just three hours, everything finishes in about three and a half hours. So it's hard to make friends and I had to do things by myself. But in Korea, doing things in groups - is well established. / - That's right. So people can hang out while waiting. - You can befriend people. / - That's right. - Yes, we talk and / - Eat together. - eat and drink coffee. / - How about the atmosphere? It's strict. - How about Park Dulseon? / - Why her? - Well... / - Why did you mention her? - He's going to bring everyone up. / - I know her. When you mention her with this topic, it sounds like Park Dulseon is a strict disciplinarian. Jang Yoonju is... - Yoonju, yes. / - So there's Yoonju. But in a way, this is unique to Korean culture. They give deference to older celebrities here. At first, my roommate, Lee Hyejung... At first, since I was very easy-going, she gave me - a lot of advice. / - Yes, those advices are good. Yes, like things to be careful with in Korea. - She gave me a list of things. / - Like what? There were a lot of things, but first was about using formal words. Formal speech and greeting people are important. She told me that I must greet people. If you make proper greetings... That makes half the impression. That leaves good impressions of you. And she told me not to follow people to bathrooms. - Why? / - Why is that? If your superior asks you to follow her to the restroom, it means you should be ready to be scolded. - &quot;Come to the restroom with me.&quot; / - Okay. Now this person is very close with me, but when I first came to Korea and started working, one of my colleagues I worked with asked me to follow her to the restroom. I was so scared. She got scared for nothing. She thought they were close, but... - Did I do something wrong? / - Maybe she was a psycho. She was friendly just a moment ago, too. - People don't ask that in America. / - That's right. You found out later that you weren't in trouble, right? - Later... / - Later, I found out that she - was being friendly. / - She wanted to be friendly. Let's hear a bit more about how they adjusted to living in Korea. Stephanie went through a difficult time finding an apartment. - In Korea? / - When I first arrived after modeling in New York, I knew nothing about Korea. Seoul seemed so big. - It was scary. / - It must've been unfamiliar. First, I needed to find an apartment and I didn't know how. I searched the Internet and found something called a &quot;one-room-tel&quot;. - One-room-tel. / - One-room-tel. I thought it was a single bedroom apartment and the price wasn't bad. So I reserved the room and dragged my two big bags and shopping bags there. - I opened the door... / - There was just a bed, right? - It was the size of this table. / - It's small. - Yes. / - The room was small. - It was a &quot;goshiwon&quot;. / - It's a goshiwon. Why did they name it &quot;one-room&quot; then? - I didn't know. / - Everything else is communal. - You have to share a fridge. / - Yes. - The shower is shared, too. / - Everything is shared. The bed wasn't single-sized, either. It was small. My legs were sticking off of the bed. Your baggage must've filled the room. My baggage didn't fit into the room. I was shocked. People who lived there will know about this. You feel like you're sleeping with your neighbor. - Seriously. / - It's not soundproof. - You can hear them breathing. / - Their phone ringing. - You can hear the conversations. / - Yes, I could. I found out why my neighbor fought with his girlfriend. People speak softly, but you can hear everything. I wanted to advise him. &quot;You shouldn't speak to her like that.&quot; &quot;Why did you say that?&quot; I wanted to tell him. I'm bad at waking up, so I set my alarm two minutes apart. I wouldn't hear my alarm, but my neighbor would. They'd start banging on the wall whenever it went off. &quot;Turn it off already!&quot; &quot;Wake up, and go!&quot; - Your neighbor woke you up. / - Yes. Did you experience a culture shock with toilet paper? While shooting, the staff would cater food. I'd sit there eating and suddenly - toilet paper rolls would come out. / - What about it? - People wiped their faces with it. / - So what? It works perfectly. - What's wrong with that? / - What's weird about it? It's called toilet paper. In America, people call it toilet paper. Toilet paper. - They're only seen in restrooms. / - Really? I wondered as well and thought, &quot;Why is this sitting on the table?&quot; Restaurants do it, too. - In restaurants too! / - I've never heard this before. I'd go eat chicken and - find toilet paper on the table. / - Of course. - What do you use? Tissues? / - This must be... - Tissues? / - I had no idea. - Tissues are... / - You use that to blow your nose. - Is there another type? / - Yes, napkins. - Napkins. / - It's all separate. - Napkins, I see. / - It's all the same for us. We use toilet paper to do everything. If you make it long enough, you can dance, too. - We do a lot with toilet paper. / - We can throw them. (Welcome to the toilet paper world) Hyunwoo, is this how you thought of toilet papers, too? I was shocked at first as well. - Of course... / - I don't think you were. - Are you surprised? / - Yeah, right. Am I turning red? / I didn't know, I swear. &quot;I was shocked.&quot; - You came back as a teenager. / - Believe me. John was flustered because of Korea's drinking culture. When we drink in America, we just toast to the first glass. After that, you're on your own. You can drink as you'd like. I went to a gathering once and we drank soju. I was sitting in the corner. My seniors and the staff were all there, too. I can never sit cross-legged on the floor. So I was sitting like this. (Sitting comfortably in a corner) - That's comfortable. / - Yes, this is comfortable. I like the direction of this story. I kept on pouring soju for myself. It sounds like a bad situation. It'd be like an attitude issue. I'm usually the youngest at all the gatherings. So I always have to watch for empty glasses. - The youngest has to do that. / - That's right. I didn't know about it at first. I kept on drinking by myself. (Pouring for himself) One of my older colleagues asked me then, &quot;Did something bad happen?&quot; - &quot;Are you giving me an attitude?&quot; / - Yes. When John started doing variety shows, his big head became an issue. - Is this a bedtime story? / - Yes. I can relate to you because my head is big, too. Do you get stressed out because of your big head? I don't really care because I'm a rapper. I only found out that my head was bigger than average after joining the industry. It's oversized. When I attended school in America, calling someone small-headed is more insulting. - He's right. / - Really? - I heard that. / - It can mean that you have - a small brain / - It's like calling someone a fool. Defconn's a genius, then. - Yes. / - He's a genius. He's a PhD candidate. You never heard that in America? Not once. A reporter said for the first time, &quot;You have a big head.&quot; A reporter? Not a lot of reporters say those things out loud. - He insulted you. / - Who was that? I didn't realize that it was supposed to be insulting. I said, &quot;Yes&quot; and took it without prejudice. &quot;I think it's pretty big, too.&quot; At that time, I took a picture with Joo Jinmo. I was a bit forward and he was in the back. The picture totally contrasted the size difference. Is this it? How can this be? - How much forward were you? / - Wow. - Well... / - How much forward? - John's head is triple in size. / - Wow. - My goodness. / - What is this? Someone drew a picture of what they thought was going on. It depicted Jinmo sitting on my lap. (Jinmo sitting on John's lap) He's sitting on his lap. - Is John a giant? / - My goodness. Jinmo looks like a child. I never stressed out about my head, though. Medically speaking, someone with my head size should be about 187 cm. That'd be the correct height. I have a big face, too. His proportion is right. Defconn should be three meters tall. - About three meters? / - Yes, about that much. - Eric is small-headed. / - He has a small head. I heard conversations about head sizes for the first time in Korea. - It's only in Korea. / - It must be. - I didn't understand it at first. / - At first? I also thought, &quot;Why are they mentioning this?&quot; And about height, too. I know I'm not that tall. When I was on the audition show, the writers suggested that I wear shoe lifts. I didn't know why. I couldn't understand. Have you never used shoe lifts since then? Well, no. (I'll keep my shoe lifts) You can't find shoe lifts in America, right? - You can't find any. / - There aren't any. When I visit America from time to time, my friends think I've grown. - I'm secretive about it. / - Really? John, did you get yourself in trouble for your manners? I got in trouble for physical contact. When you meet someone for the first time, regardless of gender, you shake hands first in America and friendly hugs are common. But in Korea, I had to be cautious about shaking hands with women. - Really? / - Why? I didn't want to be ill-mannered to someone I've just met. You were being cautious about a number of things. People feel awkward about physical contact in Korea. Physical contact happens only between acquaintances. It's weird to do that with people you meet frequently. I met with Jang Jane, who was in the audition show with me. It was a year after the show ended. It was the first time in a while, - so I gave her a hug. / - Okay. - We spent time together. / - You became friends. I've seen things I shouldn't have. - You've seen what? / - You saw what? What did you see? Can you tell us what it was? Her face without makeup. - I see. / - Oh. What's wrong with seeing that? For some people, it was. Anyways, we were good friends, so I gave her a hug. - That can happen, right? / - It was very awkward. - I see. / - Why? I could feel the awkwardness coming from her. - I got it, okay. / - She didn't know what to do I could feel that she was awkward and uncomfortable. Maybe you hugged her too tight. - No, it was like this. / - A light hug can't hurt. She's a close friend to me. I couldn't just wave hello. A handshake wouldn't feel right and a hug wouldn't either. - I didn't know what to do. / - So it was awkward. I'm glad to see the other person, but I can't express myself. This happened between us in the waiting room. It's been a while since we've met. We didn't know what to do as we said hello. We've lived in Korea for too long. What if you met in America? - Hey, what's up? / - This is what we would've done. - We give hugs. / - We peck on the cheeks, too. - Really? / - Will that be awkward? When I shake hands with people, they always say, &quot;Eric, you're so American.&quot; They always say that. I became rather cautious, too. - I usually give a hug. / - This is because you were both raised in America. This doesn't happen. Maybe you're speaking of very old times. I was in America for seven years and that's not a short time. That kind of physical contact happens between childhood friends. People who meet for the first time, especially between men and women, rarely make physical contact. Can you relate to this story? Let's see. He's thinking. Were you asleep? This isn't about hugging, but I almost broke my nose once. - Why? / - When people open doors in America, they usually hold it open for others behind them. - That's a part of their culture. / - I heard so. In Korea, I walked after a man who pushed a door open. (He followed after a person) (And bumped into the door) - He left without holding the door. / - Oh. You must've been really surprised. So things like that really happen a lot. I was misunderstood because of this. - What was it? / - Because of what? Usually, when we talk, eye contact is normal. But in Korea, they look at each other's nose. But in Korea, they look at each other's nose. - So I get conscious. / - It's because it's awkward. - It's because we feel awkward. / - We do feel awkward. - No. / - That's why Stephanie was gazing at me straight into my eyes. - I thought she liked me. / - She was fascinated. - She's fascinated. / - She looked at me, too. You're that type of person, right? You stare into people's eyes when you talk. - That's etiquette in America. / - We don't do that. When Defconn takes off his shades, he looks - What are you talking about? / - like Dakota Fanning. Show her. - Show her. / - &quot;Daddy, Daddy.&quot; - Make eye contact. / - Hello. He's just like Dakota Fanning. He looks like Dakota Fanning. We've talked to our five guests. Now, we will separate into our rooms and discuss your personal preferences. There will be one room for the married folks and another for singles. All right. Let's move to the rooms and continue our conversations. You two are here with me. You know why you're here, right? - Yes. / - Yes. We're married. We're the ones who understand life. It feels so empty. It feels so empty. - Right? All of a sudden. / - All of a sudden. I miss Stephanie. Where Stephanie goes is very important. It is. It feels so empty without her. Her room becomes the main room. - It must be like a date there. / - I know. Stephanie changes the mood. This room feels like a backroom. It's like a studio warehouse. That's how it feels. It slightly looks like a restroom, too. It slightly looks like a restroom, too. - A restroom... / - That's funny. Welcome to the singles' room. Welcome, Stephanie! - Welcome! / - Welcome! Welcome! It's time to find out what these singles like. Since we're all young and beautiful, we should talk about our ideal types. - That's why we're here. / - That's right. - Today is... / - That's right. This is the most meaningful part of today's show. But Eric, I've heard that you don't like questions like this. When I first came to Korea, people asked me if I'm dating anyone, who I like and who my ideal type of girl is. They asked about my preference in such detail. But for me, these are very personal things. - It's personal. / - Yes. - That's why. / - We won't ask then. We won't ask then. - You can ask. / - We understand. - We got it. / - You can ask her. If he's uncomfortable with it, we shouldn't force him. - We won't ask. / - We want to be considerate. No, it's fine. You can ask. But when I first came to Korea, I couldn't understand that well. - I have a question. / - Yes. Have you dated a foreigner? - Have I... / - Yes. - Have you dated a foreigner? / - A foreign girlfriend? I've gone out with a few, but I never dated them. That's the tricky part. How're they differentiated? How's just going out and having a girlfriend different? When you're just going out, physical contact is allowed, but... When you're just going out, physical contact is allowed, but... (Physical contact without dating?) (Does John date freely) (In liberal America?) (He stops) Wow. - Oh, goodness. / - I mean, America... I'm talking about American standards here. - American standards, right? / - American standards. For example, you can be physically intimate together without being official. - I see. / - And being an official couple means making the relationship exclusive. That's how it is. Have you ever dated a foreign man? - A foreigner? / - Yes, a foreigner. - Yes, an American. / - I've never dated one. But I wouldn't mind. So you've been only dating Koreans in America? What kind of question is that? Why would you ask that? Am I not allowed? - That's not what I meant. / - Why did you... - That's such a bad question. / - It's too direct. - That's what I said. / - What's a better way to ask? Can you make it sound better? - So... / - Why did you ask it like that? You've never dated a foreigner, but you don't mind dating one? So have you been only dating Korean men? Isn't that the same question? - It's the same question. / - You're right. - It's the same question. / - I understand now. - It might sound bad, / - Yes. but let's just ask her straight. Have you dated a Korean guy? You've only dated Korean-Americans? - Yes. / - I see. Is dating a non-Korean different from dating a Korean? Is there a cultural difference? Not everyone is like that, but most Korean men try to control their girlfriends. They have that kind of trait. - They try to tie you down? / - Yes. They don't like girls going out, or drinking much. There are rules like that. Korean girls have similar rules. It's similar to what Stephanie said. You have to talk to your girlfriend every day. But when I dated a non-Korean, I contacted her about once or twice a week. - Once a week? / - Are you dating at all? - Twice a week is... / - If you're busy, that happens. Shouldn't you at least leave a message? - Why? / - Even if you don't know when she gets up or what she's doing that day, without all the little details, a good relationship can be maintained. That's a culture shock. It was a culture shock for me, too. Why do I have to text her when I wake up? About 15 years ago, you two used to be among the four famous single men. Lee Hyunwoo, Yoon Sang, Yoon Jongshin and Kim Hyunchul. At the time, you were very famous. Hyunwoo is the first man who dreams of a happy ending. Yoon Sang is the man who brings music to your heart. Kim Hyunchul is the example of masculinity. Yoon Jongshin is the man who's like peppermint candy. You're still famous, but at the time, you were as famous as Gang Dongwon, Hyun Bin, Song Joongki, Zo Insung, So Jisub and G-Dragon. You were just as famous as these guys. - You're exaggerating. / - No, I'm being serious. You were just as famous as them. - Thank you. / - I'm serious. Thank you, but that's... - Yes. / - I am serious. - We're not that desperate. / - That's not what I mean. Among the four of you, who changed the most after getting married? Since we got married, our lifestyles totally changed. Especially, our nights out changed dramatically. - They completely changed, right? / - Completely. Even if we go to popular hang-outs at night, it's not fun anymore. - It's like that. / - There's no purpose. Purpose? When we were younger, we had animalistic instincts. - You know? / - I see. - I see what you mean. / - That's right. - We don't have that anymore. / - That's right. Even in the bar, I get bored. I get bored. (It's boring without a purpose) - It's not fun. / - You seem to strongly agree. When we were at a cafe, we'd look whenever someone new came in. - We would check who came in. / - That's right. If the door had one of those bells, you would look whenever someone came inside. That was our instinct. But now, even if the bell rings, I don't really look. One of my close friends is still single. He sits in a cafe famous for having pretty customers and reads &quot;Time&quot; magazine all day. (He reads &quot;Time&quot; magazine) Why does he do that? Why does he read &quot;Time&quot;? So that he can accomplish his purpose. - Why would he do that? / - His coffee evaporates. He just reads the magazine. - I see. / - That's funny. - We were like that once. / - I know. Hyunwoo, if you can go back to that time, what would you do? Anything you want to change? If I can go back in time, I would meet my wife earlier. I would meet my wife earlier. Where are you looking at? The camera. Your wife is watching this at home. I love you. (He survives by appealing his love) Why did you do that? Why did you do that earlier? I live like this. How about you, Yoon Sang? What if you can go back in time? I got married when I was 35 and I think it was the right time to get married. At the time, I was considered late. But after I got married, I realized it wasn't too late. I don't miss being alone. I thought this show became &quot;100 Minute Debate&quot;. How about you, Jaeseok? Well, I said this a while ago. If I had the chance to go back, I would go to clubs more often. At the time, I didn't have money. I wanted to go clubbing more, but I couldn't. - You really love clubs. / - I wish I had gone more. I really love going to night clubs. I didn't go clubbing because I didn't have money. If I was earning like you two were at the time... - Clubbing is fun. / - Yes, it is. - There's this excitement. / - Of course. You can feel it as you go down the stairs, it smells bad and and music plays. - And today... / - &quot;Pig Mom&quot;, &quot;Pacific Ocean&quot;... - These days, waiters aren't named. / - You're right. Do you go clubbing these days? Do you sometimes go clubbing? Three years ago, - I got curious about / - Okay. - the music they play. / - In order to make a trendy song, - Yes. / - you have to go to clubs. - I went for that reason. / - Yes. It was so hectic. - The music is much louder now. / - Yes. People there - don't even look at me. / - I see. I felt like a useless person there. I promised myself that I'd never go clubbing again. They were like pushing me and telling me to move. They were like pushing me and telling me to move. I realized that I was going down like this. - Anyway... / - Yes. Okay. - Is it the twilight of your life? / - What? - Twilight? / - That's excessive. I still have ten more years to go. - You have to go to a lounge bar. / - A lounge bar? - That's right. / - A lounge bar. I can manage a lounge bar. - Let's give a round of applause. / - Stephanie! - I heard something. / - Yes. During the pre-interview... I don't know if you'd say the same thing, but you said you prefer smaller and shorter men? So the crew asked her what she thinks of me. - You're the smallest. / - She said in perfect Korean, &quot;Mom, help me.&quot; (When she's in danger, she can speak perfect Korean) - &quot;Mom, help me.&quot; / - With the perfect pronunciation, she said, &quot;Mom, help me.&quot; I was just surprised. But he looks very different in person. Do I look different on TV? - Yes. / - How so? I thought you tend to show off a lot. (The short and pushy guy) You looked very active. Now that I see you in person, you seem very gentle. - Oh. / - Yes. - Are you just trying to save him? / - Yes, I am. - Are you just trying to save him? / - Yes, I am. Stop having false hope. - No, really... / - His lips were like this. I should at least have some hope like that. He goes back and forth between being happy and sad every week. So your dream guy is someone short. Since I'm tall, a short person looks more attractive - since we're different. / - I see. - You are attracted by differences. / - Yes. - The face... / - Saeho's very different from you. - He's too different. / - He's from a different race. With this much difference, he's a different kind of life form. - I'm sorry, but... / - He's an alien life form. I'm sorry, but my parents are watching. I'm not saying you're bad, but that you're different. After each show, my mom calls me crying. - &quot;I'm sorry, Son. I'm sorry.&quot; / - You're not wrong. - You're different. / - What are you sorry about? - No, you're just different. / - How am I different? - Apologize to my parents. / - No, it's not that. - You're not bad, but different. / - My mom says sorry. You have a wide face and you're short. - It's a different... / - Oh, so I have a bit of - a different kind of charm. / - That's right. - That's a good word to use. / - That's right. Since we mentioned it, should we do this? All right. We'll do the &quot;Who's Your Dream Guy&quot;. Let's settle things here. - All right. / - Good, then before we start, let's show our charms. - Show our charms? / - Do we need to do that? Stephanie's heart may change. We're at a disadvantage now, so we need to show her our charms. - Let's start with Eric. / - What should I do? Normally, people would sing a love song. - Is there a song you like? / - Oh, gosh. - I like Bruno Mars. / - Which Bruno Mars song? - &quot;Marry You.&quot; / - Okay. - The song's already too... / - Isn't this cheating? - This is cheating. / - It's really... - Do a vocal imitation instead. / - What? - A vocal imitation? / - Yes. - A five-letter poem. / - Make a poem with Stephanie. - This is really hard. / - &quot;S&quot;. Hold on, let's start again. - &quot;S&quot;. / - Stephanie. - &quot;Te&quot;. / - More than TTS. - Oh. / - More than TTS. &quot;Pha&quot;. I think you're fantastic. Okay, we'll accept fantastic. - &quot;Nie.&quot; / - I don't... Even if you don't know me. Even if you don't know me. - &quot;Lee&quot;. / - &quot;Lee&quot;. I'll lead you. - Wow. / - Wow. - That was good. / - What was that? Even if you don't know me, I'll lead you. - It's like the lyrics. / - How did I make this up? - How did I do this? / - That was good. - Wow. / - You scored a point again. - I've done this for the first time. / - He scored. Saeho, make a poem with Stephanie Lee. You need to win. - &quot;S&quot;. / - Stephanie. - &quot;Te&quot;. / - I've never seen anyone like you. - &quot;Pha&quot;. / - Should we go to Paris? - &quot;Nie&quot;. / - Or shall we go to Nice? - Nice is also... / - Nice? - &quot;Lee&quot;. / - He's done so well. - Hey, you... / - No, I mean... - You do it. / - How can I do that? - You've done too well. / - You've done so well. Yes! - Now it's John's turn. / - John. - Me? / - Are you going to sing? - Should I dance? / - Dance? Really? - Anything. / - A dance or a song. - Could you sing a song? / - Which song? Sing Beyonce's &quot;Single Ladies&quot;. 'All the single ladies, all the single ladies' 'All the single ladies' 'If you liked it, then you should've put a ring on it' 'If you liked it, then you should've put a ring on it' - I'll end it here. / - That's right. He was known for having a similar face with Beyonce. - Amazing. / - Was there something like that? - Oh, that composite picture. / - It's really there. 'Listen to the song here in my heart' 'With a melody I sung for her' - Why are you doing that? / - His teeth... - I don't know the lyrics. / - The lyrics. - Do you know the lyrics? / - Me? I do. - If you know the lyrics, help me. / - I know &quot;Listen&quot;. - Saeho, you should do it. / - Let's go. (He tries to make vibration noises) (He tries his best) - Raise your voice. / - Why is your chin shaking? Why is your chin shaking? 'Listen, I am alone at a crossroads' 'I'm not at home in my own home' 'And I've tried and tried' 'To say what's on my mind you should have known' - Wow. / - Oh, my. - Wow. / - See this. (Who is her dream guy?) - Now, Stephanie. / - I'll make my choice. - Did you make your final choice? / - Yes. All right. Go! (Stephanie's dream guy) (Eric Nam) What is this? Was that a prank? (He denies the truth) It's not a prank. You pushed me, didn't you? - Do it again. / - No. - He didn't push you. / - No, he pushed me! That's what we used to do in the past, we don't do that anymore. We don't do that nowadays. She's nothing but just tall. (His attitude suddenly changes) - Go away. / - What did you say before? - What? Go away. / - What did you say before? What? I said I don't have money. Why don't you lend me money? - Won't you lend me money? / - You asked for money? Yes, why don't you lend me some money? (The single guests' preferences are known) Anyhow, today is about preferences. Let's talk about it right away. Today's topic is when you suddenly receive a three-day vacation. If you don't answer honestly, we can't continue. The sudden three-day vacation. Will you spend it alone? Or with your family? (Well) (What is their choice?) I don't even need to think about this. Since I live apart from my family, I'll definitely spend it with them. - The three-day vacation? / - Yes, that's right. I always spend three days, a week, and a month alone. So you'd rather spend the three days - with your family. / - Yes. How about you, Hyunwoo? I will... (What's Hyunwoo's choice then?) I'll spend the three days alone, while thinking about my family. (Take care of yourself) (While you pretend to care for your family) - This guy talks... / - He talks so well. I think you really fit in well with our show. From the way you dressed up and everything else. - It's painful. I'd think of my son. / - That's right. - But sometimes you need time alone. / - You need that. That's right. Since you're in the same shoes, if you had three days, would you spend it with your family? (Alone versus) (Family) Since I spend a lot of time with my family... Will you choose to spend it alone? Well, that's... For 3 days, yes. If it was 4 days, I'd spend it with my family. (It's a close call) - For a day difference? / - Because four days is perfect for going somewhere with my family. But if it's three days, I think it's better to spend it alone. - Of course. / - Yes. (National host Jaeseok becomes an ordinary married man) To be honest, when you get married, you change according to the situation. - You're well aware, right? / - Of course. (Thinking the same thing) I've said this a few times on this show. I often end up being cautious of my wife. It's scary. You become afraid that you might say the wrong thing. So I think I need to be more careful. Even on the show, we might say something wrong. I think something like that happened when I came on this show before. Hyunwoo and I came out and I used to like women who didn't put on makeup. But since she doesn't do it too often... (His wife is always without makeup at home) (The nostalgic past) I said I wished my wife would put on makeup at home. I wished my wife would put on makeup at home. When I looked at it later. (Startled) Wait, this is... - This is... / - This was aired that time. Even for me, this is... That almost sounds like a crime. Well, I just answered because I was asked. Before I got married, I used to ask people to say things that they haven't yet said. But after I got married, I fully understand how that feels. Since you have your lives at home... - Thank you. / - Of course. We must survive. Yes. (I would be able to survive, right?) Lastly, let's send your wives... Like a video message? Yes, it doesn't have to be long. Sending video messages are so childish. You were continuously... - We're doing it for you. / - Okay. - Would you do these... / - We'll take care of that. - Like a heart. / - Yes, don't worry about that. - Computer graphics improved a lot. / - Of course. Well... (To Hyunwoo's wife) Strawberry. Strawberry. - Strawberry? / - Yes. (Holding his laughter) - Your... / - Hold on a minute. Let's go with Yoon Sang first. I think it's better to let you go first. I was startled when he said strawberry. You should go first. You might look shabby if you do it later. - Go first. / - Well, then. I'll just... Hyejin, you know next month, you'll have to come to Korea with the kids. Be careful, so they don't cause trouble on the plane. (A message of worries and requests) Do that over a phone call. - This is a video message. / - I almost cried. Wait for a moment. We'll go with Strawberry first. - First, take a look. / - This is difficult. Yes, you should do that over a phone call. Take a look at Strawberry. Let's go again. Strawberry, like we always have... Strawberry, like we always have... It's because you keep laughing. This is... - Your face is a strawberry. / - This is... You're the strawberry. Strawberry. Your scent is... This isn't something funny. (Massive laughter) - I think we shouldn't laugh. / - Okay. Let's do it for real. Strawberry, your scent gets stronger as time passes. Don't forget my love. Don't forget my love. I'll see you later. Strawberry. Strawberry. Strawberry. (It's a legendary video message) - This makes me look bad. / - Well, it's... Then you should say &quot;pear&quot;. You should do something. He said Strawberry. But the part, &quot;your scent&quot;. Gosh, I couldn't stand it. How do you bring yourself up to say those things? But it's an intimate conversation between the two of us now. - Wow, you're impressive. / - Hyunwoo, you impress me. - I'm sorry. / - No, we're just impressed. Hyunwoo's video message is the best one I've seen. I haven't seen anyone saying those things in video messages. What's your secret? I'm envious. (I'm envious of Hyunwoo's abilities) You should wear a sweater like his. Seriously. Then you're next. - Should I call her by her nickname? / - Yes, do that. My Little Bell. My Little Bell. (Rolls and laughs) (It's so funny that filming almost had to be stopped) - Why? You told me to do it. / - You're as bad as me. - Why? You told me to do it. / - You're as bad as me. - He's as bad as me. / - There is a nickname. You had a nickname for her, Little Bell. How come you didn't use it? - &quot;Little Bell&quot; sounds sexier. / - But my wife is... What do you mean it sounds sexier? Yes, say something to your Little Bell. - Little Bell is a good nickname. / - Yes. My Little Bell, I'll see you in a month. Let's do our best to be good parents. This is hard. - You should've said this. / - What? Little Bell, you're getting louder and louder. - Okay, okay. / - You should say that. - Please edit the one before. / - Yes, let's go again. Your echo is getting louder and louder as time passes. My Little Bell. Your echo is getting louder and louder in my heart as time passes. I love you a lot. - Say &quot;I'll see you soon.&quot; / - I'll see you soon. You should send her a kiss, too. You should send her a kiss, too. That was great. I'm so happy. Ms. Strawberry and Ms. Little Bell. I'd like to thank Ms. Strawberry and Ms. Little Bell. I'm not sure why, but the two sound like they could be sisters. The nicknames go well together. We can wrap up this segment on a happy note. - I'm glad. / - Me too. (Everyone is happy in this room of married men) All right, Defconn. Is today your last day? - That's right. / - You did a good job today. Yes, it's my last day. I'm used to playing rough games outdoors and drinking fish sauce... - as a penalty on the other show. / - That's right. Filming in a warm indoor space like this is as sweet as honey to me. - That was a funny expression. / - I know. I know. I'll show you my gratitude for your love through good songs. Thank you. - Okay. / - I see. - Yoon Sang, it's your turn. / - This is too obvious, but my concert starts tomorrow. (My concert starts tomorrow) - Now we know why he's here today. / - I see, yes. My concert is starting soon, too. - These people... / - Seriously. Let's see what kind of sweater Hyunwoo will wear at his concert. Thank you for joining us on &quot;Happy Together&quot; today. We'll be back next week with more fun stories. - Thank you! / - Thank you. (Next week's show will be so much fun!)
