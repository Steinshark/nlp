I'm sure it's not my style... I look like my mom, don't you think? My bracelets! They ought to jazz this skirt up! Put the bracelet under the skirt, And wrap the rubber band around it.

That's it, folks! You win, Bella! But it came with a price. That's embarrassing... So gross!! It's okay, Bella! Sweating's natural! I have an idea. C'mon! See this regular T-shirt? Take scissors and cut like this. Then go the opposite direction. In the end, it should look like this. Hello, muscle tee! See these? Tie them in a little knot like this. And then a bow. Pretty cute, right? My skin can actually breathe now! And it's stylish too! All that nasty sweat's gone! Wish I could say the same. See ya! Someone needs his own muscle tee!

Thanks a lot! Seriously?! I knew I wasn't cut out to be a bookworm! This is a library, remember? SHHH!!! I feel kinda bad. Hey, it'll be okay! Just leave me alone! I don't need your sympathy! Wait! I know exactly what to do. First, untie these laces. Then the pants. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Oh boy... Cross the ankles. Then tie them together with the shoelace. Nice and tight! Then fold the legs back like this, And stick the extra laces in the belt loops. Pull it all the way through. Then turn the jeans over, And string the laces through the front loops. Put the books inside like this. Then tie them nice and tight. See? Now you have a makeshift backpack! It even has armholes! Hey, it actually worked! This is pretty awesome! Uh, thanks, nerdy girl! See ya.... That lipstick's pretty nice. Huh? The sale's today?! I'm comin'!!!! Yes!! It's even better than I imagined!! And everything's discounted. Wow, that was the fastest I've seen! Got it!!

I'm practically swimming in it! I need some reinforcements. Any belts out here? That clip! Just gonna take it for one second... This is exactly what I need! Just spread it apart, Bunch the fabric, And use the pin to secure it. And now they fit perfectly! I think I'll wear them outta here. Just need some great pumps. Am I a fashion genius or what? Thanks for the awesome sale! Keep the change. Hey, wasn't I wearing a clip? That's super weird... This party is gonna be epic!! Uh, miss Bella? Care to explain this pigsty? Don't worry about it. I'm more concerned about what to wear. Is this color good? It's a little too pink. But these could work! It's still a mess in here! You have way too many clothes. I'll be back. Whatever!! Did you see Amy's outfit this morning? If she won't clean, I will. Hey! Mom, stop. I can't take this anymore!! Uh-oh. I'll call you back. Serves you right. Oh man, my mom ruins everything! Unless...
