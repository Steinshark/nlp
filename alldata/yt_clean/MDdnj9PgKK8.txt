Dilara: Honey... Taha: But... my head won't fit through. Taha: It's snowing. Dilara: Lightning just struck. Taha: Don't wander off, Memba, okay? Dilara: I think this is the first time in my life I'm seeing thundersnow. Taha: Yeah, looks like it's going to be a stormy night. Taha: Look at Memba, playing in the snow again. Dilara: The thunder just won't stop. Taha: Did you see the snow on the ground? Dilara: Look at the clouds, they're practically crashing into each other. Dilara: How long have we been here? Taha: Let's quickly set up the balcony. Taha: Come on, almost done. Dilara: Your hair is frozen. Taha: Seriously? Taha: Just a bit more to do. Dilara: What if your hair breaks off? Taha: It hurts, too. Taha: It's all wrinkled from the cold. Dilara: Honey, the tray's all bent. Taha: Here you go, honey. Dilara: Thanks. Taha: Don't put too much in, it won't cook like that. Taha: I don't know. Dilara: Is it still snowing? Dilara: Sweetie... Dilara: Should I put this under the tray? Dilara: Oh... Dilara: My hand... Dilara: Ow, it burns so much. Dilara: Ugh, the snow is amazing. Taha: Yeah. Dilara: My favorite meal -fish and onions. Dilara: Well, the tent on the balcony burst. Dilara: We worked on it all day. Dilara: Didn't even get a chance to record it. Dilara: Is it fixed now, what do you think? Taha: I patched it up, but it's still inflated. Dilara: Fingers crossed. Dilara: Let's take it this side. Taha: We'll see in the morning. Dilara: I was going to make chicken tonight, but... Dilara: I got fish from the freezer for convenience. Taha: That's fine. Taha: Yeah, me too. Taha: The tent took a lot out of me. Taha: Look, this spot isn't even sticking. Dilara: I don't understand why it's not holding. Dilara: It's deflated again. Dilara: If the patch doesn't hold, what do we do? Taha: Well, with the stove's heat, it might hold. Taha: That's it. Dilara: I think it's working. Dilara: Memba's belly is full. Taha: Yep. Taha: Now it's our turn. Dilara: Alright, it's ready. Dilara: Oh, looks so good. Dilara: Sweetheart, you finished your food and now you're sniffing ours? Dilara: Wait until you see the dessert. Dilara: I'm making dessert. Dilara: I love eating fish so much. Taha: Yeah. Taha: Oh no. Dilara: Did it hit the stove? Taha: The snow piled up too much, that's why. Taha: To the left. Taha: Move to the left. It keeps stucking. Taha: I can't inflate anymore. Taha: Did you grab the flashlight? Taha: That's fine, we don't really need it. Dilara: I'm wearing your boots, and I can't walk in them. Taha: The outside of the RV is starting to ice over. Dilara: Get in from my side if you want. Dilara: The wind's hitting us from here. Dilara: Memba gives it a try. Dilara: Come here, sweetie. Dilara: Sweetheart, are you eating snow? Dilara: Look at her mouth -it's all white. Taha: She's turned into a snow queen. Taha: Let me leave it like that so it's easier to open. Taha: Yes, sweetie, come here. Taha: My little girl loves the snow, doesn't she, mama? Look at her now. Taha: Do our hair look alike? Taha: Are you making the dessert tonight? Taha: I'm really tired. Dilara: Sure, I'll make it tomorrow with coffee. Dilara: I'll make it at lunchtime. Dilara: Oh, my little one. Taha: Sweetheart, come here. Good girl. Taha: She's warmed it up. Taha: Come closer. Taha: Goodnight. Someone's shivering over here. Dilara: Memba, you don't shiver when you're running in the snow, though. Dilara: Goodnight. Dilara: Babe... Dilara: How on earth are we going to get out of here? Dilara: The balcony's collapsed. Taha: Did it completely collapse? Taha: But... my head won't even fit through. Dilara: It's not opening. Taha: The tarp's blocking it. Taha: Plus, snow's piled up in front of it. Taha: I could force it, but the door might break... Dilara: Can you get out through this window? Dilara: Then again, this window doesn't fully open either. Taha: It's completely packed with snow. Dilara: We're trapped. Taha: Nah, we're not trapped. Dilara: You'll have to get out from here, no other choice. Dilara: This window. Taha: Was there really that much snow out there? Taha: We're on a rescue mission, Memba. Taha: Daddy's coming to save us. Taha: Just look at the outside of the RV. Dilara: You okay? Taha: Covered in snow, but fine. Taha: Morning, everyone. Dilara: Morning. Taha: The snow's really piled up out here. Taha: It's taller than her. Where are you off to, girl? Dilara: Memba... Dilara: Where are you going, sweetie? Taha: You'll get lost. Go under the car. Taha: Come on, come back. Taha: Don't dive into every pile of snow you see. Come here, girl. Taha: She can't even walk in it. Taha: Honey, this is completely deflated. Dilara: I was just recording outside. Dilara: I haven't seen snow like this in years. Taha: Look at the snow on the roof. Taha: It piled up a lot. Dilara: Oh my. Taha: Don't laugh! Don't laugh. Dilara: Are you cutting it? Taha: It's already torn up all over the place. Dilara: Goodbye, inflatable balcony tent. Taha: Oh, my sweetie. Taha: Look, Memba's gonna check the depth now. Dilara: Ooh. Taha: Good girl. Taha: Come on, come on. Good girl. Taha: Yeah. Taha: Let's head inside; we're freezing. Dilara: Come on, run. Taha: Come on. Dilara: Good girl. Taha: Everything's frozen solid. Taha: Look at this. Dilara: Oh no. Taha: I have no clue what we're going to do. Don't even ask. Dilara: Let's warm up first. Taha: Yeah. And my sweet girl's hungry. Dilara: I'm starving. Taha: Memba's definitely hungry too, right, girl? Taha: Oh, come on, really? Taha: It hit a tree. Taha: I don't even know which tree it's in. Dilara: Oh no. Taha: I'll go check. Taha: Honey. Taha: I can't see it. Taha: Found it. Taha: Over here. Taha: Yeah. Taha: About 4-5 meters. Taha: I'll figure something out. Dilara: He's shaking the tree now. Dilara: But I don't think it's gonna work. Dilara: Look. Taha: We'll extend it. Dilara: What if we tie these two sticks together with the brush? Taha: Let me take that. Taha: What if the brush gets stuck in the tree too? Taha: I'll give it a try. Hopefully, it's not broken. Dilara: Is that stick long enough? Dilara: Is it long enough? Dilara: Okay. Taha: You can't see from there. Taha: Yeah. Dilara: Right at the top. How can I show you? Dilara: Oh no. Dilara: He needs to extend it just a little bit further. Dilara: Should we tie the tripod? Taha: There's a stick over there. Taha: I'm this close but still can't reach. Taha: The drone's still working and making noises. Taha: Hand me that. Taha: Can you give me two more? Taha: The drone doesn't matter much. Dilara: The window was closed for a minute, and now it's packed with snow. Dilara: Here we go. Dilara: Oh, it fell. Taha: Got it. Taha: The camera's a little frosty, though. Taha: It's working fine. I'm bringing it in. Taha: Thank God. Taha: Even the propellers are fine. Taha: Just this part is frozen. Taha: Can you grab some tissues? Taha: Sorry, girl. Dilara: Come on, Memba. Come and eat your food. Come here. Taha: Look at this. Dilara: It's looking good. Taha: No balcony, drone crashed... Dilara: What can you do? Dilara: Whoa. Dilara: We're putting the tarp in the bathroom to let the snow melt there. Taha: Done. Fits perfectly. Taha: Move, Memba. Taha: Everything's frozen solid. Taha: Even under and around the balcony. Look at the sides. Taha: Let's hope we can close this balcony. Taha: I have to break the ice here. Dilara: Did it work? Taha: I think it's working. Yes. Taha: Oh, I'm so relieved. Taha: Nope. Taha: Let's leave this open for a while. Taha: Let's head out. Taha: Maybe it'll melt by then. Taha: Come on, Memba, let's go. Taha: You stay here. I'll be right back, alright? Taha: Let's hope the balcony doesn't get in our way. Dilara: Don't veer to the left. Dilara: We can't move right now. Dilara: We have to help them first Dilara: And the balcony's still open. Dilara: It's getting dark too. We'll see what happens. Dilara: Oh, it's closing. Dilara: Oh, God. Dilara: It actually closed. Unbelievable. Dilara: Thank you so much. Taha: But we've got a small problem, honey. Taha: We've got no brakes. Taha: They're not working. We're uphill, Taha: For now... Taha: We'll use the engine brake and ease down slowly. Dilara: I think the cold cracked the wheel's fitting over there. Dilara: That's where all the brake fluid leaked out. Dilara: I explained that right, didn't I?
