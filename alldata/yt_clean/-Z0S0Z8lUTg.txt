I am but a mirror whose only purpose is to show you what your own eyes cannot yet see. Whenever people list their favorite well-written character in gaming, Kreia tends to be brought up as a shining example. With her Shakespearean mannerism and Machiavellian attitude, she is without a doubt, one of the most interesting and fleshed out characters in gaming. Her reputation primarily comes from her philosophy that tends to be often misunderstood both in all world and in the story itself. However, no matter how well-written of a character she may be, Kreia does not exist in a vacuum. To be able to fully understand Kreia and her philosophy, some background information about the Jedi and Sith ideologies and their differences is required. In the original Star Wars movie, there was never any defined philosophical distinction between the Jedi and Sith. We only understood that the Jedi were good, and that the Sith were evil. There are some thematic hints such as the Jedi being in tune with nature, while the Empire and the Sith rely on on cold technology. The first hint of a philosophical explanation came from Yoda in the Empire Strikes Back. Later, new materials was added in the Star Wars Expanded Universe, over the years, that fleshed out the Jedi and Sith. But it was only when the game Knights of the Old Republic was released that the Jedi and Sith were each given a coherent ideology. The core of each faction's belief can be understood from their code that outlined the principle tenets of how one should live their life in relation to the Force. Let's start with the Jedi Code. By itself, the Jedi Code makes little sense and has brought up a lot of confusion. For example, the very first line: ''there is no emotion there is peace'' is often misinterpreted at the code saying that there's no such thing as emotions. It is only when you add the word 'when' to each sentence that the Jedi Code becomes understandable. When there is no emotion there is peace. When there is no ignorance there is knowledge. When there is no passion there is serenity. When there is no chaos there is harmony. Essentially, most of the Jedi Code is repeating the same axiom that when there is no conflict or emotions peace is achieved. The last line of the code could be taken as literal. There is no death there is the Force. When you die, you become one with the Force. But it could also be understood that when there is no death there is the Force. Meaning that everything that is living is connected to the Force. Both interpretations are valid. The real world equivalent of the Jedi Code is Buddhist philosophy which is appropriate as the Jedi are essentially space wizards samurai monks. The Force, itself a living energy, found in all thing, that binds the universe together is similarly shared in Buddhist philosophy called prana. It's also commonly known as Chi energy and other different names. By being at peace, you can become in tune with life in the universe. Meditation is a key aspect of Buddhism that is often used by the Jedi to center themselves and remain calm. Buddhism has myriad's of teachings and schools of thoughts, but the core shared belief is that all suffering is caused by desires which creates conflict. Much like the Jedi, Buddhism preaches, tranquility, peace and only using your strength for self-defense. In contrast, the Sith never had much in terms of philosophy in any of the movies. The Emperor was evil for the sake of evil. And Vader was nothing more than a broken man in a shell. It is only in the first Knights of your Republic game that the Sith were given a proper ideological foundation that went beyond the simple grapples of being evil. On Korriban, the Sith code is introduced as an alternative to the Jedi Code. &quot;Peace is a lie, there is only passion.&quot; &quot;Through passion, I gain strength.&quot; &quot;Through strength, I gain power.&quot; &quot;Through power, I gain victory.&quot; &quot;Through victory, my chains are broken.&quot; &quot;The Force shall free me.&quot; The first line: ''that peace is a lie there is only passion'' is a direct refutation of the Jedi axiom that peace can only be found if there are no emotions, and in turn it becomes the axiom of the Sith. &quot;The Jedi would have you believe that peace is a desirable goal. That peace of the spirit is the way the Force is mastered, that a lack of conflict betters man.&quot; &quot;We know different. It is our passion, our hate and our desires that fuel the Force. It is conflict that improves the lot of civilization and single being both.&quot; &quot;Conflict forces one to better oneself. It forces change, growth, adaption, evolution, or death.&quot; &quot;These are not our laws but the universe's. Without conflict, there is only stagnation.&quot; Just like the Jedi, the Sith equally follow a real-world equivalent: the philosophy of Nietzsche. He similarly valued conflict to better oneself-- to use your will to create meaning. The well-known quote: ''what doesn't kill you makes you stronger'' very much defines the Sith as an ideology. By affirming your life and imposing your will you can change the world and mold that as you see fit with your power. This is the ideological groundwork of both philosophies and in idealized manner. And, like all philosophies at the conceptual and abstract level, it is only how we understand how they are applied that we see their strengths and failings. So now that we have some basic context for the Jedi and Sith, we can dive deeper into what makes Kreia so interesting. Among the canon of Star Wars, Kreia is unique because she experienced the pinnacles of the Jedi and Sith and saw their failings. Kreia's life history gives us an insight to what she learned among those groups. However, her life story isn't told in a linear fashion. We need to piece together the clues that are scattered throughout the game. Since the early days, there is a popular theory that Kreia is the Jedi Master Arren Kae who trained Revan as a Padawan. This is correct but it's not a complete truth. What is important to understand is that Kreia was known as Arren Kae in the early days of her life. I'll explain why later. Kae was a historian and Jedi Master. She strongly believed in the Jedi Code but found that it lacked something. She saw that the Jedi Order were failing their students as many kept falling to the Dark Side continuously. The allure of power and the call of the Dark Side is always present but it doesn't explain why the Jedi would constantly fall despite their training. There was something missing in the Jedi Code itself. Unlike the rest of the Jedi that ignored the teachings of the Sith and viewed it as taboo. Kae learned the contrast to see she could strengthen the Jedi by understanding what made the Sith it so alluring. When you ask Kreia about Atris, she mentioned that Atris mirrors a stage of her own past life. &quot;Because Atris' path is a path that I walked long ago. And it is a chapter of my life that has been read and closed.&quot; &quot;She has taken the first steps I think, we shall see.&quot; &quot;Surely you felt the righteous anger. The spoken judgement, the lack of forgiveness.&quot; &quot;I was a historian once, gathering the relics of the Jedi, learning the ancient mysteries.&quot; &quot;Always there were more questions.&quot; &quot;One quickly learns that the Jedi Code does not give all the answers.&quot; &quot;If you truly wish to understand, you will need the contrast. Not adherence to a single idea.&quot; &quot;That is why Atris and the others This is likely how Kae used to be before she joined the Mandalorian Wars. &quot;I was a historian, a chronicler of the Jedi.&quot; &quot;I sought to preserve the knowledge of the Jedi, and to do that I needed to know the Sith, in order to destroy them.&quot; &quot;The Jedi were that was left to me. And yet I was so far removed from them that I betrayed them.&quot; &quot;In some part of me, I had made choices, compromises, but always for the sake of the Republic, for the galaxy.&quot; Kae likely advocated Sith values such as the value of conflict which other Jedi Masters despised. This was the beginning of her fall from the Jedi Order. During that period, Kae met the Echani general Yusanis and fell in love. When the male Exile spars with the Handmaiden Brianna, the daughter of Kae, Kreia wonders what would happen if you continued to spar. &quot;Have you ever wondered what it would mean in the Echanni ritual if the two of you spared and you fought and won, complete and utterly? &quot;If perhaps she would give in, surrender herself to you?&quot; To me, this seems too insightful and personal to be a simple observation. This is likely what happened: Kae sparred with Yusanis, repeatedly, then submitted to him and fell in love. Just as her daughter that denounced her oath to Atris, Kae denounced her oath to the Jedi Order. What Kae did during the war and afterwards is a mystery. She fought under Revan with Yusanis but nothing much as know afterwards. The Jedi Master Kavar and the Handmaiden Brianna assume that Kae had died at Malachor V. &quot;I never saw her face. And she did not return from the final battle of the war. She died on the battle that shattered Malachor V.&quot; &quot;I thought that you died in the Mandalorian Wars.&quot; &quot;Died? No. Become stronger. Yes. At that point, history becomes even more uncertain. Kae fell deeper to the Dark Side and despised the Jedi for exiling her. There are no hints of what happened before Kae became known as Darth Traya. During and after the events of the first Knights of the old Republic game until the beginning of the Knights of the old Republic 2 game, Traya trained Nihilus and Sion. Nothing is known about the origins of both men other that they were tragedies of the Mandalorian Wars. That is when Darth Traya reached the height of her power. And from that pinnacle of power, she was stripped of her connection to the Force. And it was at that moment that Kreia was born. At that point, it's not entirely known how Kreia escaped death and found the Exile. I would like to think that Revan ended up on Malachor V with the Ebon Hawk and Kreia escaped using the ship. On the Harbingers log, it reports that the Ebon Hawk was under attack from a Sith Warship. It is very likely that he (Sion) was trying to capture her and Kreia just happened to find the Exile by '''''''''chance''''''''. And that's the events that lead up to the beginning of the game. So this is the basic overview of her long life history. It will be important as a reference of the foundation of Kreia's philosophy. The reasons why Kreia eventually left the Jedi Order gives us a greater understanding of their failings. Just like Atris, Kae sought to understand why so many of the greatest of the Jedi fell to the Dark Side despite their training. The Disciple and the Jedi Masters Zez Kai-Ell ponder on this point: &quot;From the failures of the masters, from our failures to properly train Jedi came disaster. led disaster.&quot; &quot;And I wondered if perhaps the teachings of the Jedi had been our failling all along.&quot; &quot;There have been so many failure from teachers who believed in the code with all their being.&quot; &quot;Master Arka failed Ulic. As Master Bass failed Exar Kunn.&quot; &quot;As Kae and Zhar and the others of the council failed Revan and Malak.&quot; &quot;From all the acts we do to preserve the galaxy, from such an arrogance that all we do right and just, I wonder if there is a counter-effect that is created that strikes back at us.&quot; &quot;Exar Kunn, Ulic Qel-Droma, Malak, Revan, you, all Jedi; there is something wrong in the Force, a wound, a sound, like a scream.&quot; &quot;&quot;You can hear it echo on Narshadaa sometimes when the moon is on orbit.&quot; &quot;It is a frightening thing to feel. Perhaps being connected to all life is not enlightenment at all, but simply another doom.&quot; &quot;But the reason the Jedi Civil War was named such is because few in the galaxy can recognize the difference between the Sith and the Jedi. &quot;To them, they are both Jedi, with different philosophies.&quot; &quot;Jedi often fall. &quot;Ulic Qel-Droma and Exar Kunn, the two Dark Lords during the Sith Wars many decades ago were both Jedi Knights. As were Revan and Malak.&quot; &quot;It is perhaps more amazing that some trust Jedi after so many have fallen and endangered the galaxy.&quot; &quot;It is also proof that a single Force Wielder can change the face of the galaxy. And that is a frightening thing indeed.&quot; &quot;Jedi are not supposed to be like the rest of us. They're supposed to see a higher purpose in all things.&quot; &quot;And, they are supposed to train students responsible and well so that the mistakes of the past are not repeated.&quot; &quot;Yet all I saw was ignorance and arrogance, and what those seeds created in the Republic.&quot; &quot;It is difficult to follow the Jedi Code when so few others have.&quot; &quot;I harbour... doubts, concerning the Jedi.&quot; &quot;Many Jedi defined the Order during the Mandalorian Wars and it paved the way towards the Jedi Civil War.&quot; &quot;The students made their own choices, as much as the histories tell us.&quot; &quot;Perhaps I judged the Masters unfairly, yet I still wondered why they did not rise to stop such threats earlier. Or perhaps they did not see them?&quot; &quot;Master Arka taught Ulic. Master Bass was the one that saw that Exar Kunn would become, yet he took no steps to stop him.&quot; &quot;Master Zhar taught Malak. And Revan had many Masters including Zhar, Kae and Dorak.&quot; &quot;Towards the end of the training, Revan saught out many other Masters to learn certain techniques.&quot; &quot;And it is said that he went to his first and final Master to learn how best to leave the Order as she had. And such teachings and their teachers is why I harbour doubts, why I wonder if there is something missing from the Jedi Code.&quot; &quot;There is no blame - all must accept. But, at its core, one must wonder if it was the failure of the Jedi teachings or the teachers themselves.&quot; &quot;Many of the Jedi trained Exar Kunn, Ulic, Revan and Malak; how could they not see the danger they posed?&quot; &quot;And if they could not, perhaps there was some essential part of their teachings that was flawed. Something beyond the Jedi Code that they were missing.&quot; The Jedi Code does not offer all the answers The axiom that peace peace can only be achieved if there is no ego. What the Jedi lack is the ability of being human and finding value in their life. The Jedi understood, maybe unconsciously, that if anyone were allowed to seek conflict, to have adventures, to make friends, love, or just live life; it would lead people down the path to the Dark Side. The Jedi cannot permit *any* to have a sense of pride or desires. They train those who are Force Sensitive so They adhere so strongly to the Jedi Code as a suppression of all conflict which only weakens them and doesn't actually prevent some from falling to the Dark Side. This can be seen as a major failing of the Jedi with Anakin in the prequel movies. &quot;Are the Jedi allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi?&quot; &quot;Attachments are forbidden.&quot; &quot;Possession is forbidden.&quot; &quot;Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love (also known as Agape), is central to a Jedi's life.&quot; &quot;So you might say that we are encouraged to love.&quot; Anakin loved Padme and feared losing her like he did with his mother. He went to see Yoda for some counsel and the only advice that was given was some Buddhist anti-life lessons. &quot;Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the Dark Side.&quot; &quot;I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.&quot; &quot;Death is a natural part of life.&quot; &quot;Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not miss them do not.&quot; &quot;Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of Greed that is.&quot; &quot;What must I do Master Yoda?&quot; &quot;Train yourself to Let Go of everything you fear to lose.&quot; That's an easy thing to say when you don't value anything to be at peace. Anakin couldn't accept losing Padme because he loved her, and it brought him down the path to the Dark Side and the destruction of the Jedi Order. &quot;I have failed you Anakin, I have failed you.&quot; Forming bonds and having emotional value towards others makes you weaker and susceptible to the Dark Side but it also makes you human. This is a lesson that the Jedi do not teach. It is something Jolee Bindo references as well in the first Knights of New Republic game. &quot;The Jedi, and their damnable sense of over-caution would tell you that love is something to avoid.&quot; &quot;Thankfully, anyone who's even partially alive knows that's not true.&quot; (Note: Jolee is wrong here; Love *DOES* lead to the Dark Side. Watch my video The Philosophy of Jolee Bindo to understand why) (Note: Jolee is wrong here; Love *DOES* lead to the Dark Side. Watch my video The Philosophy of Jolee Bindo to understand why) (Note: Jolee is VERY wrong here; Love *DOES* condemn you.) (Note: Jolee is VERY wrong here; Love *DOES* condemn you.) &quot;And how you deal with the bad part of love determines your character, what determines the dark side's hold over you.&quot; &quot;A life without risk is boring. You want love? You have to fight for it.&quot; The Jedi teach their followers to become automatons by But even through such rigid trainings, It wants to exist and live! The greater your connections to life and to others, This is echoed with Luke in the Empire Strikes Back when he starts to have visions of his friends being tortured in the possibility of them dying. &quot;Luke, you must complete the training.&quot; &quot;Argh. I can't keep the vision out of my head; they're my friends and I have to help them.&quot; &quot;You must not go.&quot; &quot;But Han and Leia will die if I don't.&quot; &quot;Patience.&quot; &quot;And sacrifice Han and Leia?&quot; &quot;If you honor what they fight for? Yes.&quot; And Yoda was right as it was a trap but what is interesting is Luke's He follows the Jedi way by sacrificing himself &quot;It's all about the greater good...&quot; &quot;The greater good!&quot; The basic principle of altruism is that a person has no right to exist their own sake and must serve others as the only justification for their existence. With self-sacrifice being the highest moral duty, virtue and value. Duty is the moral necessity to perform certain action with no reason other than the obedience of some higher authority and purpose without any regards to personal goals motives or desires. The core of altruism is self-destruction and the view that the self is evil with selflessness being the standard of the good. &quot;The Jedi use their power for good.&quot; &quot;Good is a point of view, Anakin.&quot; &quot;The Jedi are selfless. They only care about others.&quot; After you free Atton from his prison cell on Peragus, the Exile has to go down a shaft to find a way back to the Ebon Hawk. Atton warns that it's suicide. One of the dialogue options is saying that After you escape the station of Peragus, Kreia talks about starting a war with these new Sith. And, again, the Exile has a dialogue option that a Jedi's life is sacrifice. This teaching principle is echoed throughout the game with the In Nietzschean terms, the Jedi are the embodiment of Slave Morality. The essence of Slave Morality is utility for unity; the good that is the most useful to the whole community at the expense of the individual. Another way of seeing this is that and only help out of obligation The Jedi are preventing the greater evil by not using their power to mold the galaxy as they see fit. If we look at the Jedi from a lifelong linear experience, it gives a greater overview of how the Jedi teaching are anti-life. At a very young age the Jedi remove children that are Force-Sensitive from their families so that they may not form connections with their parents. &quot;The Jedi separate children from their parents.&quot; &quot;It is because family exert a strong influence on one's development.&quot; Some people were surprised that the Jedi initially rejected Anakin to be trained when he was only 9 years old. &quot;He's too old.&quot; It made sense for Yoda to reject Luke, as he was already an adult. &quot;He is too old, too old to begin the training.&quot; But... even Anakin, at his age, was too old? The Jedi Council correctly sensed that Anakin had already formed connections with his mother and feared losing her. &quot;See through you, we can.&quot; &quot;Be mindful of your feelings.&quot; &quot;Your thoughts dwell on your mother.&quot; &quot;I miss her.&quot; &quot;Afraid to lose her, I think, hmm?&quot; &quot;What does that have to do with anything?&quot; &quot;Everything.&quot; &quot;Fear is the path to the Dark Side.&quot; &quot;Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.&quot; The key point is emotional bonds. The younglings grow up with their first memories being with a Jedi, only knowing the Jedi way, never forming any connections; learning the higher mysteries of the Force and its techniques. They become zen, losing their ego, forgoing any selfish desires to never succumb What kind of life is that? It's such a waste of life and their time alive. By teaching their students never to value their life, never seeking any selfish desires and to accept their death as a natural part of life, the Jedi Code destroys human nature. &quot;I do not want to train you to become a Jedi Knight. I want you to learn to be human.&quot; You would assume that the Sith are more humane than the Jedi by being more individualistic. But, ironically, they're even worse! Their failing is that they become so consumed by their lust becoming monsters that bring doom to the galaxy. But throughout that quest for power, what have the Sith achieved? What changes or value have they brought to the galaxy? Nothing. This rise and fall of the Sith is a life story that is echoed many times in the Star Wars Canon. The pull of the Dark Side is that once you fall you become unaware that you desire more power for the sake of power until you become an agent of evil. In the first Knights of the old Republic game, you can talk with the Sith Yuthura Ban about her past. She reveals her life story about how she joined the Sith. &quot;I am originally from Sleheyron, if you must know. I was a slave to a cruel master, Omeesh the Hutt.&quot; &quot;The Hutts control everything on Sleheyron, and a slave means nothing to them.&quot; &quot;I was determined not to be 'nothing.' &quot;One night when the drunken worm had me alone in his chambers, I stabbed him and escaped the compound.&quot; &quot;I stole onto a cargo ship and was not discovered by the crew until they reached the next system.&quot; &quot;They left me for dead on a desolate planetoid, alone. But that was fine by me. I was glad to be anywhere other than Sleheyron.&quot; &quot;It was not luck that I was eventually rescued, of course. The Force was strong with me, though I didn't know it at the time. Not until the Jedi told me, that is.&quot; &quot;They took me in and trained me even though I was older than most Padawans.&quot; &quot;I never progressed beyond Padawan. I had discipline, but no peace. And after my treatment at the hands of the Hutts there was little room in me for the ways of the Jedi.&quot; &quot;I wanted to use the Force to free the other slaves I knew, to fight for what I knew was right. &quot; &quot;The Jedi restained me until I couldn't stand it any more.&quot; &quot;The claim the dark side is evil, but it isn't so.&quot; &quot;Sometimes anger and hatred are deserved and right. Sometimes change because of it.&quot; &quot;Being a Sith doesn't make me a monster, however.&quot; &quot;There is suffering and injustice in the universe. I am surprised the Jedi can even stand the stench of it, much less stand by and do nothing.&quot; &quot;Any failure to get the result I want is due to a lack of power on my part. That can change, in time.&quot; &quot;But my anger has not diminished, nor my desire to see change.&quot; &quot;But my anger has not diminished, nor my desire to see change. The more time O spend with the Sith, the more I am certain that one day I will be able to fight as I must.&quot; She remained trapped, trying to become the next leader &quot;All the things I wanted to do, all the wrongs I wanted to right. I haven't done any of it. They just get father and father from my mind.&quot; &quot;All I've cared about is power and myself. This isn't the person I was.&quot; This is echoed similarly with Anakin when he joined the Sith to prevent the visions of Padme's death. After committing his path down the Dark Side by killing the younglings and eradicating the separatist leaders, Padme tried to bring him back from the Dark Side but... it was already too late. &quot;You turned to the Dark Side. You killed Younglings.&quot; &quot;Anakin, all I want is your love.&quot; &quot;Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.&quot; &quot;But at what cost? You're a good person. Don't do this.&quot; &quot;I won't lose you the way I lost my mother.&quot; &quot;I am becoming more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of. And I'm doing it for you, to protect you.&quot; &quot;Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.&quot; &quot;Don't you see? &quot;I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I-I can overthrow him.&quot; &quot;And together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.&quot; (God I love that evil smile) &quot;I can't believe what I'm hearing. Obi-Wan was right: you've changed.&quot; &quot;I don't know you anymore. Anakin, you're breaking my heart.&quot; &quot;You're going down a path I can't follow.&quot; &quot;Because of Obi-Wan?&quot; &quot;Because of what you've done. What you plan to do.&quot; There is an alternative ending in the Revenge of the Sith game where Anakin won his duel against Obi-wan on Mustafar. it shows his further descent towards the Dark Side and his desire of being in control. &quot;It's over Anakin, I have the highground.&quot; &gt;implying high ground memes are real &quot;Don't try it.&quot; &quot;Excellent work my apprentice. There are none left to oppose us. The galaxy is ours now.&quot; &quot;Your new weapon Lord Vader.&quot; &quot;No. The galaxy belongs to me.&quot; This is part of what Kreia understood when she lost her power and connection to the Force. She squabbled to obtain and, in the end, she lost everything and changed nothing. &quot;I wielded power like you cannot imagine.&quot; &quot;Everything I saw was &quot;I saw all of that, all that the Force is. And only when it was ripped from me did I truly see it.&quot; In Nietzschean terms, the Sith are the embodiment of Master morality. The essence of Master morality is individual strength that promotes power and influence. Another way of seeing this is that the Sith only care about while anything that diminishes their power to be bad. &quot;Unlimited Power!'' There's nothing wrong with seeking power as it is the nature of all life to impose their will on the world but when you amass yourself among people who only seek power for the sake of power rather than seeking progress or to change anything, it becomes self-destructive to the point where nothing is achieved. &quot;I had a name once. Ajunta Pall. Yes, that was my name.&quot; &quot;I was one of many. We were servants of the Dark Side. Sith Lords, we called ourselves. So proud.&quot; &quot;We hid from the Jedi, but is was not they who destroyed us. Is it not obvious what we did?&quot; &quot;We destroyed each other. We desired the secret of each other, to increase our power. &quot;We battled until finally, our fortress rained down on top of us.&quot; &quot;The ancient Sith destroyed each other. The fundamental flaw in their philosophy, one would think.&quot; &quot;I assume that's the nature of the Dark Side: power but no longevity. Eventually, it just consumes itself.&quot; &quot;The Sith respect order and control, that is true. But few ever hold that power for long.&quot; &quot;To see their philosophy at work is like watching a continual collapse. Just like watching their academy fall in on itself.&quot; The Sith, as an ideology, is unsustainable, and leads to death rather than overall improvement. And, as a continual lifestyle, it is vain and does not provide any amount of peace. This lack of fulfillment is heavily reflected with Sion. His only goal was to destroy the Jedi and bring pain to the galaxy. After you defeat him on Malachor V, you can ask him: ''was it worth it?'' And he tells you the truth. &quot;It was not. No matter how many I killed. There was no end to the pain; the blades the Force tore through my flesh. &quot;I am glad to leave this place, at last.&quot; Near the end of the game, if you take the Dark Side path and kill all the Jedi Masters then go to Dantooine, Kreia will ask you a simple question that you cannot avoid. &quot;I must know if killing them, if revenge brought you any measure of satisfaction.&quot; &quot;If seeing them dead has settled the disquiet within you.&quot; &quot;Because it matters to me in a way that never mattered to the Jedi, to the Council.&quot; &quot;I did not wish to see the Jedi dead. Defeated perhaps.&quot; &quot;I merely wished them to see that they and their teachings were wrong. That one could not truly understand the Force simply by adhering to the Jedi Code.&quot; &quot;All I have ever trained have been failures to them. Students who went to fight the Mandalorians, who fell to the Dark Side, who abandoned their training&quot; &quot;Let us return to my question: &quot;If by killing these Jedi, if you achieved measure of peace?&quot; Whichever option you select, the answer is essentially the same: ''no I have not obtained peace, there are still more people to fight, to kill''. &quot;It was as I thought. You have failed me, completely and utterly. &quot;I have taught you to hear the Force again, &quot;This is what you have brought: countless murderers, slayers and &quot;You showed them life without the Force. And instead of showing them truth, power, all you showed them was how the galaxy may die.&quot; &quot;Even now, events spiral towards destruction and there is nothing that can be done because you refuse to listen, to understand.&quot; &quot;Yet it is all for nothing. To have the Jedi Masters &quot;You have not heard I have taught. So, now that we have a complete understanding of the failings of the Jedi and Sith, Kreia's philosophy becomes much more poignant now that we can The core value of Kreia's philosophy &quot;All that talk about manipulation and hatred and standing &quot;Still, if we were all judged by who However, it would be foolish to simply classify her as a Sith considering she doesn't identify as either a Jedi nor Sith. &quot;Does it matter? Of course it does. &quot;Perhaps I am neither and I hold both as what they are: pieces of a whole.&quot; The only way to comprehend what she stood for At the beginning of the story, on Peragus, Kreia only wishes to escape the clutches of Sion and to protect the Exile. &quot;I came to warn you Jedi. You know not what path you walk.&quot; She doesn't say anything of substance regarding After escaping, Kreia offers herself to be a teacher to the Exile. &quot;Our link may have had other consequences. Perhaps you can hear &quot;I may be able to teach you to feel the Force again.&quot; &quot;The threat we face is grave. If you cannot defend yourself, then we have already lost.&quot; &quot;I offer to train you to become strong again, to know the ways of the Force, and to hear the Force sing with you as it once did.&quot; &quot;Whenever I travel with you, Upon landing on Telos, you're placed under house arrest You can help or you can work with the galaxy's spawning conglomerate (Czerka) that will reward you with wealth. Let's side with the Ithorians as it is the faction that is considered to be the Light Side path. The Ithorians are weak with grand plans to heal the planet But... they lack strength to impose their will. As such, they beg you to help them over the Czerka corporation. However, Kreia doesn't approve of the relationship. &quot;I do not approve &quot;Habat has an agenda and he hopes to tie you into it to use you for his own ends.&quot; &quot;Its speech is filled with maybes and perhaps, while the world under its care burns and dies.&quot; &quot;You should heed my advice. It would be best if you avoided such needless entanglements.&quot; You do all their quest without any reward for your work and then you obtain your ship. But then, just as you're about to fly away to the Northern area, you get a Because they're weak, You have no obligations to save them. You can just ignore them and fly away... There is an equal lesson You conduct illegal dealings, lie and steal from the Ithorians, Unlike the Ithorians, Kreia doesn't disapprove because you are being compensated for your strength. However, it should be noted that money is a tool for exchanging Czerka relies on its wealth This is weakness because it can only buy influence When the mercenaries decide to storm the offices of Czerka &quot;Be reasonable Lorso. You really aren't in a position &quot;Do you feel in charge?&quot; &quot;I gave you a small fortune.&quot; &quot;And this gives you power over me?&quot; UUUU &quot;You have wonderful timing.&quot; &quot;I had my reservations about some of these mercenaries but I had These two paths echo the lesson of strength that Kreia advocates from the Sith: do not rely on others as the source of your power build your own strength. Another planet of importance--Nar Shaddaa--is a great microcosm of Kreia's Everyone is squabbling for any amount of power; mercenaries and bounty hunters roam around, and a weak fear the strong. You have to find a hidden Jedi Master on a planet of billions and the plot But before you can start, there is an unavoidable event of great interest &quot;I saw what you did to those Exchange thugs, kind stranger. Can you spare a few credits? Help a refugee in need? &quot;Forgive me, stranger, but if you have The first option is to give it to charity, while the second option Whichever option you select, Kreia will scorn you. if you choose the Light Side option she will complain that being altruistic without thinking is bad. &quot;Thank you stranger, I won't forget your kindness.&quot; &quot;Why did you do such a thing? Such kindness will mean nothing; his path is set.&quot; &quot;Giving him what he has not earned is like pouring sand into his hands.&quot; &quot;What if by surviving another day he brings another darkness upon another.&quot; &quot;The slightest push, the smallest touch sends echoes throughout life.&quot; &quot;Even an act of kindness &quot;By giving what he has not earned, perhaps all you have helped him become is a target.&quot; &quot;Seeing another elevated often brings the eyes of others who suffer.&quot; &quot;And perhaps, in the end, all you have brought is more pain.&quot; &quot;And that is my lesson to you: be careful of kindness and charity, Kreia is not advocating against charity, she simply wants you to understand The Dark Side option also has its criticism from Kreia. &quot;Forgive me, stranger, please, I beg you, do not kill me.&quot; &quot;Why did you do such a thing? Giving into your feelings over &quot;The smallest push, the smallest touch, sends echoes throughout life.&quot; &quot;These acts of cruelty may &quot;Cruelty leads to suffering. &quot;The suffering within builds, until its sound is all one hears.&quot; &quot;And when a kindness is offered, &quot;From one act can come tremendous power when the echo has travelled as far as it can.&quot; &quot;Send a great echo and power will come to you. The day shall come when you can test your strength, I promise you..&quot; Again, Kreia is not saying that you shouldn't indulge in your passions &quot;Mind what I have said. Use your power, but in its proper place.&quot; After that encounter you have the rest of Nar Shaddaa as your playground to stir up trouble. Upon entering a marketplace, the Exile begins to feel the current of life of all the people living on Nar Shaddaa. &quot;Your thoughts are disturbed. I can feel them like a shiver running through you.&quot; &quot;It is Narshadaa, the true Narshadaa that you feel around you. It is this moon with &quot;What you feel is the echo of the minds of these creatures within the Force. Their anger, their greed, their desperation; it is life.&quot; &quot;It is but the vibration of minds driven by life's struggles. The struggle to feed, to take, to mate, to fight; it is the way of things.&quot; There's an interesting dialogue option on whether it is possible to move (manipulate) the masses. And Kreia offers an interesting answer. &quot;One might as well move the universe, but such manipulation is possible, yes.&quot; &quot;It requires that one feel the critical point within the structured mass and &quot;The ability to fool the minds of others, masses, to dominate them &quot;Manipulation is done through propelling events, or selected ones, &quot;And the greatest of victories are not manipulations at all but simply awakening &quot;But let us be silent. Words and thoughts are distractions. Feel this moment, Manipulation is arguably one of the most undefined aspects of Kreia's philosophy as it is something that cannot be taught only learn instinctively, then understood rationally. Let's focus on the refugee center as it holds an important lesson on manipulation. On Narshadaa, there's a large bounty placed on the Jedi. The intergalactic crime syndicate, The Exchange, have clamped down hard under refugees in an attempt to break their will. Initially, there doesn't seem to be any reason for such a horrible treatment. But, it's later revealed that Obviously, if you start helping &quot;I'm feeling a little better. Thank you.&quot; &quot;And what is it you think you have accomplished?&quot; &quot;If you seek to aid &quot;It is the internal struggles when fought and won on their own that yield &quot;The currents of the galaxy, of nations, of peoples, may all stem from such &quot;Every small fracture that you creates weakens the whole.&quot; &quot;If you care for others, then dispense with pity and sacrifice, and recognize the value of letting them fight their own battles.&quot; &quot;And when they triumph, they will be even stronger for the victory.&quot; There is an interesting side quest that reinforces this lesson. In the refugee landing pad, &quot;For a minute, I thought that you were someone else.&quot; &quot;My wife, Aida, there's a chance that she may be here on Narshadaa.&quot; &quot;A lot of refugees ended up here &quot;The thing is that I can't get into the refugee sector.&quot; &quot;The Exchange has the place barricaded with thugs. They're putting the squeeze &quot;Now I'm almost cleaned out. I burned the last of my fuel Upon finding his lover and reuniting them, &quot;Aida, I didn't think I would ever find you. I can't believe you're here before me.&quot; &quot;The destruction of Telos? I can't even tell you what happened after, &quot;Shh. We can talk about it later. You have my thanks, stranger. &quot;It would have been better had he found her on his own. By aiding him you &quot;It is the internal struggles when fought and won on their own that yield &quot;If he truly loved her, truly, he would have entered the refugee sector &quot;You have made their union easier, not better.&quot; &quot;If you care for them, then dispense with pity and sacrifice &quot;And when they triumph, they will be stronger for the victory.&quot; What Kreia wishes to teach is not that you shouldn't help others, but if people are unable to help themselves, you can &quot;It is from such small things, &quot;That is why you must indulge them, and indulge yourself.&quot; &quot;It is not aiding them that matters &quot;Use their dependency, feed upon it, So... returning to the refugees, &quot;Hello traveler. My name is Hussef. I try to look out after the other refugees.&quot; &quot;You've got the Serrico refugees on the west-ward side. &quot;And on the inner-side, you have the Overseer &quot;Occassionally their thugs kidnap people and sell them into slavery with the Hutts.&quot; &quot;They've also hemmed us in. &quot;They're trying to break out spirit so we'll be slave workers for the Hutts!&quot; &quot;This may be an opportunity for us.&quot; If we make life miserable enough for the refugees, &quot;I won't succumb to the Exchange! We have children here, with bright futures. We can't give up! Walking around the Refugee area, you'll find a sick man &quot;Keep back, I am ill. Contagious the others say.&quot; Unlike the typical knee-jerk Jedi response to heal without thought, you can convince him to kill himself using guilt. &quot;I suppose I will die anyways. Arghhh.&quot; Elsewhere, in the refugee area, a mother is weeping, &quot;Are you one of Saquashes' men? Did you take my daughter?&quot; &quot;Don't you work with Saquashes?&quot; &quot;He took my daughter Adana to sell to the Hutts, Now... you *could* pay her debts but if you seek out to help out everyone you'll be penniless almost immediately. So... you can persuade her to sell herself &quot;Yes, I suppose that is one way we can stay together.&quot; &quot;Oh, this is terrible. This is so terrible. But I must be with Adanna.&quot; After convincing these two, the refugee leader will &quot;How can you give Nadda to the Exchange like that?&quot; &quot;Oh, these are terrible times for us. &quot;There's no hope left for us. I will speak with the Overseer.&quot; Achieving this will result a hand of applause by Kreia. &quot;Well executed, you have created an echo, Forcing the refugees to capitulate will almost immediately grab By examining how all the threads affect each other, *That* is the lesson of manipulation. Now, this might bring up some obvious moral questions but Kreia would simply tell you to ignore them. &quot;You weaken yourself by pretending that morality If you are significantly down the path to the Dark Side and find the Jedi Master on Nar Shaddaa, the Wookie Hanharr will be added to the party. &quot;Awaken, beast.&quot; (Angry, confused roars in Wookie) &quot;I have saved your life, beast, that makes it mine.&quot; &quot;Kneel.&quot; (Question in Wookie) &quot;Because there is something to be learned, beast, &quot;The beast is a lesson in strength. Learn that lesson and you will understand.&quot; &quot;He is life at its more primitive. &quot;The beast's strength is prodigious and you can learn much from it.&quot; &quot;Speak to him, discern his nature. Perhaps then it will become clear.&quot; When speaking to Hanharr, In a way, Life Debts are a form of slavery, In his madness, Hanharr killed his tribe It's the reason why he wears shackles around his wrists. If you ask him why he doesn't simply abandon his codes, he answers that he cannot. He would no longer be a part of his tribe. He would have to create his own codes, his own values based on nothing. And that is something he cannot do. As the Exile remarks, to face such oblivion to stand firm in your own If you become a slave to codes or an ideology, then your entire being is dictated by categorical imperatives, abstract notions of your mind; it means to live by pure ideology to the point where you This is represented beautifully with Zaalbar where he has to choose &quot;I saw what the Sith did to Taris. Anyone who serves &quot;Mission, I am bound by the oath of my life debt.&quot; &quot;Zaalbar, it's not betrayal if you break your life debt now.&quot; &quot;If I go back on my vow, I am betraying my people, my ancestors. I cannot do that.&quot; &quot;No, Zalbaar, I don't care. I won't help the Sith &quot;I'm not going to stand aside and do nothing. &quot;I have no choice. The life debt is greater than any single life. It is a solemn &quot;Zaalbar, what are you saying? It's me, Big Z, Mission!&quot; &quot;Mission, forgive me!&quot; Please, Zaalbar, don't do this, please. No!!! HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Upon returning to Kreia, you tell her your discovery: Hanharr is strong yet he is powerless; raw strength is nothing compared to the will of mind. &quot;Ah, you are a perceptive one indeed. In this instance you are correct.&quot; &quot;All that strength, that anger, it is restained by his belief, his doubt.&quot; &quot;Everyone is made up of events in their past &quot;The mind gives strength or makes some powerless.&quot; &quot;He walks but he is dead. It is because he is not ready to &quot;It is to surrender yourself. To make a slave to a teaching or belief that makes it so that belief will always rule you.&quot; The lesson is about volition, the power to Never live for the sake of another or an ideology, live for yourself. And if you do believe in an ideology, Become what strengthens &quot;To believe in a idea is to be willing to betray it. &quot;That is the lesson of strength.&quot; After Kreia explains this lesson, she introduces a final test &quot;Yet that is not the only lesson that the beast can teach us.&quot; &quot;Not only does one's will control &quot;Surely you have felt the beast's presence onboard &quot;And the hunger you feel does not stem &quot;He does not realize how deep his life debt runs, but he will.&quot; &quot;When you suffer, call upon that hunger &quot;Reach our, feel his presence within the ship, clawing at you, pacing.&quot; &quot;Feel the rumbling of the haul, the metal around you like a cage, the building anger, &quot;If you accept it, you find your strength Accepting this power will give a permanent +2 to your strength. &quot;Good. You know it now. More power is always good... right? If you've understood anything But it is a choice that few people have ever made while playing this game. Most accept this gift, blindly, Kreia will ask why you would reject such an offer. &quot;Are you sure? It will grant you strength, vitality for the times ahead.&quot; &quot;Forsake it, deny it and you will deny power.&quot; The answer given forshadows a decision made on Malachor V &quot;Ahhh. And that is the choice of Malachor V, at last. &quot; &quot;You have made a strange choice, a unique choice. Very well, I accept it.&quot; &quot;And know that that is the true lesson of strength. And if you're curious whether &quot;I'm always testing you, never forget that. Always be on your guard otherwise you might learn something.&quot; The rest of the planets--Korriban, Dxun, Onderon--- they do not have any interesting moments involving Kreia that reflect her philosophy. As such, they can be ignored and we can move on to the final parts of the After confronting and defeating Atris, &quot;She seeks the death of all Jedi and all Sith, While it is true that Kreia seek the destruction of the Jedi, At the end of the game, on Malachor V, Kreia explains how she used the Exile to accomplish her goals. &quot;From the moment you awoke, I have used you.&quot; &quot;I used you to gather the Jedi so that they could be destroyed.&quot; &quot;I used you so that you could reveal &quot;I used you to keep the Lords of the Sith from If you go down the path to the Dark Side and kill all the Jedi Masters, Kreia explains that they needed to be killed but does that provide an answer of why. &quot;The destruction of the Masters, the Order, it was not an end in itself.&quot; &quot;I did not expect them to still live. &quot;But now this has been corrected. And now the sides Regardless, it had to be done. To have such power Jedi still live, still be felt in the Force, The true reason Kreia sought the destruction of the Jedi Order was to correct After the destruction of these new Sith, if many of the The true failing of the Jedi is that they are blind, reject any deserve but unwilling to change or grow. Jolee Bindo even references this point about how the Jedi are fallible. &quot;You know what I hate? Well, lots of things really. &quot;What I really hate are how most people view the Jedi.&quot; &quot;Everyone think that the Jedi are perfect, that they can do no wrong.&quot; &quot;They think the Jedi Council is completely incapable of injustice.&quot; &quot;And I'm not even talking about how some of us fall to the Dark Side.&quot; &quot;No, that's plenty indication of our fallibility, but it's something else entirely.&quot; &quot;No, I'm talking about how, more often than not, your average &quot;I guess I'm not being clear, am I?&quot; &quot;Come to think of it, I don't have to be clear. Someone my age &quot;I'll tell you about a little tale about &quot;Oh, oh yes, Master Hortath. He was a kindly old Jedi &quot;He would walk into walls, knock over tables, mistake apprentices for rancor beasts. That sort of thing.&quot; &quot;And he was too proud to submit to proper treatment.&quot; &quot;Some used to counsel him and urged to &quot;But he refused to believe his eyes were failing.&quot; &quot;He simply squinted more and more as the years went on, the other Jedi &quot;So one day a young Padawan meets Master Hortath in the courtyard and, &quot;Quite sure of himself, Hortath gave the lad directors, which happened to lead back outside and away from the enclave.&quot; &quot;The Padawan is confused, naturally. He asks if &quot;The Padawan suggests that perhaps he should ask someone else, but the proud Hortath now feels insulted.&quot; &quot;He tells the Padawan to take the route prescribed and no other.&quot; &quot;Rather dejectedly, the Padawan &quot;It was decided that the boy's fate was to leave the Order anyway.&quot; &quot;Though whether that was out of respect for Hortath, &quot;The tale is about blindness, If you take a Light Side path and bring the Jedi Masters &quot;When you returned to us, we saw what had &quot;And it has left a hole, a hunger that cannot be filled.&quot; &quot;In you, we saw a wound in the Force.&quot; &quot;In you, we saw the end of the Force.&quot; &quot;You a cypher, forming bonds, &quot;In you we see something worse than merely the teachings of the Sith, &quot;And that is why you are a threat to us all.&quot; &quot;What if other Jedi went to war, &quot;What if there was a crucible that trained such Jedi to consume and kill?&quot; &quot;For you, Malachor was that crucible.&quot; &quot;And so you have brought &quot;But it is of no consequence.&quot; Rather than seeking to understand the reasons why the Exile became that way and &quot;You are a threat to all living creatures and all who feel the Force.&quot; &quot;And that we cannot allow.&quot; &quot;Our judgement before remains. Exile, you must leave, &quot;It is a punished reserved for only a few and only when necessary &quot;Forgive us, but it is necessary.&quot; &quot;Enough!&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;Step away!&quot; &quot;He has brought truth and you condemn it? The arrogance!&quot; However, it is only by understanding why Kreia desires to destroy Atris and Sith, As mentioned previously, Atris mirrors of stage of Kreia's past life when she was known as Arren Kae, and began to learn more about the Sith to strengthen the Jedi Order. &quot;I am Atris, Jedi Master. The last historian of the Jedi. The last of the Jedi.&quot; &quot;Those are titles, words you cling to as the darkness falls around you.&quot; &quot;You are that which attacked the Jedi, you are Sith.&quot; &quot;Sith is a title, yes, &quot;For you, it is different. You have bathed in the knowledge of the Sith.&quot; &quot;But there is not enough truths in such teachings. But it will be a step for you.&quot; &quot;You have gathered Sith holocrons, Sith teachings from across the galaxy. It is why you have chosen servants who cannot feel the Force.&quot; &quot;And more importantly, they cannot feel what you have become.&quot; &quot;I have sought to preserve the Jedi Order, and I have gathered &quot;How did it happen?&quot; &quot;Search your heart, it was never battle &quot;Malachor V has touched many things and it echoes still.&quot; &quot;It is such a quiet thing, to fall, but far more terrible is to admit it.&quot; Disgusted about how the Jedi did not live up to her ideals, &quot;Who are these Jedi that survived the Jedi Civil War?&quot; &quot;They're not the Jedi I know, the ones I once worshiped.&quot; &quot;They are cowards, doubters, and afraid.&quot; &quot;What manner of Jedi hide from a threat, &quot;When the Sith are destroyed, then I shall rebuild the Jedi Order again.&quot; &quot;They shall have none of the weaknesses of before. They shall be strong, &quot;They shall not train those who are easily corrupted. However, if Atris were allowed to rebuild The Exile even has a dialogue option pointing out this observation. &quot;The Sith are the Jedi, the Jedi are the Sith.&quot; &quot;The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way. Including their quest for greater power.&quot; (Revan would have been the type of Jedi Atris would have created) (Revan would have been the type of Jedi Atris would have created) When the Exile enters the tomb on Korriban, At the end of the tomb, an alternate version of the Exile can be seen alongside After the Exile defeats the evil version of itself, Revan unleashes his double lightsaber, ready for combat. What is important to note is the color of the lightsaber. Blue is typically the color of the Jedi. While Red is the color of the Sith. However, there is a single exception that happen by ''pure chance'' &quot;I'm trying to figure out who to talk about your lightsaber color. Oh. Well. Good guys are blue and greed. Bad guys are red. That's just the way it works. There's no purple lightsaber? You might get purple. A combination of Blue and Red creates the synthesis of Purple. The casting of Mace Windu equally reflects the lightsaber color. Samuel L. Jackson typically plays aggressive and overly angry characters. And in the prequel movies, he's also playing that same role but forced to be passive. On Wookiepedia, the Expanded Universe lore describes His fighting style highlights his inner-darkness that But going back to Revan, However, on his other hand, The true failing of Atris is out rather in an effort to preserve The destruction of the Sith, The Sith indulge in their passion, destroying their humanity The further you use the Force as a tool, This can be seen with &quot;The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inwards, only about themselves.&quot; The true failing of the Sith is that they strongly This weakness is exemplified with Nihilus and Sion &quot;I sense you my Master. Faint. Weak.&quot; &quot;Your senses betray you, as you betrayed me.&quot; &quot;After all that happened, still you live. You are difficult to kill.&quot; &quot;For one as limited as you, perhaps. &quot;The failure is yours. No longer do your whisper Sion and Nihilus both cannot live without the Force or they would die. Nihilus has amassed so much Force that he &quot;He, if he can be called a man any longer, is one of the Dark Lords that pursues you.&quot; &quot;He is one who learned one of the &quot;He is a breach in the Force, capable of consuming the lives around him.&quot; &quot;One cannot have power on that magnitude &quot;And it devours him as he devours others. &quot;He is already dead. &quot;Do not think of him as one would a weapon, or one of your warship of the Republic. &quot;It is terrible, but it is still a subtle thing.&quot; &quot;And that is why they and their techniques must be wiped out.&quot; &quot;No one must again learn what her master did.&quot; &quot;Instead of sending connections in the Force, &quot;Then you understand how terrible such a power is, and why it must be ended.&quot; &quot;It is an empty road to the Dark Side, &quot;It is not something he can direct, or focus. &quot;There is no strength in the hunger he possesses. &quot;And it rules him, not the other way around. It has its own will, its own instincts.&quot; &quot;And he cares nothing for the Sith, or its teachings, or the Jedi.&quot; &quot;And when the Jedi are dead, her master will feed &quot;There is no future is the empty galaxy he sees.&quot; &quot;And that is why he must be stopped: the breach must be And Sion seeks to destroy the Jedi as his only purpose in life. But... needs to Force to remain alive. He is *literally* telekinetically &quot;Of pain, he has learned much.&quot; &quot;Of knowledge, of teaching, he knows nothing.&quot; &quot;Like the others, he was spawned from the horrors of the Mandalorian Wars.&quot; &quot;He exists solely to spread his pain to all Jedi everywhere.&quot; While Nihilus and Sion represent the best aspects of the Sith the loss of will by desiring power This is all because they rely on the Force &quot;Explain something to me.&quot; &quot;Well, Jedi are suppose to be tough, capable.&quot; &quot;Yes, and what are they without the Force?&quot; &quot;Take the greatest Jedi Knight, strip away the Force and what remains?&quot; &quot;They rely on it, depend on it, more than they know.&quot; &quot;Watch as they try to hold a blaster as they would a lightsaber, &quot;I guess I never realized how much they relied on it.&quot; &quot;Do not be surprised. In many ways even you are more capable than a Jedi.&quot; &quot;You could survive where they could not, A good analogy is to compare the Force with a blade, a tool that The difference, of course, is that anything is possible with the Force. &quot;Nothing is impossible with the Force.&quot; &quot;It is an energy that flows through all living things. &quot;At times, it may even be a substance that can burn and ignite.&quot; With that blade, you might never face any hardships and can be considered to be powerful. However, relying on the blade is weakness that can be exploited. Your entire livelihood is dependent on the well-being of the sword. If it broke or if some thief &quot;There is no life without the Force. The dependency the Jedi and the Sith The problem lies directly in the axioms of their codes. While the first lines of both codes are axiom it is actually the last line of their codes that provide their overall failing concerning their dependency on the Force. The Jedi line, ''there is no death there is the Force,'' You do not live, you do not die. You are simply an extension of the Force. This is why the Jedi preach self-sacrifice &quot;Oh, not to love is no crime, or so the Jedi believe.&quot; &quot;It is their code that kills life, their adherence to the will of Force.&quot; The Sith equally becomes slaves because of the last line of their code. ''The Force shall free me'' declares that only the Force can free you from chains By having the Force as your only standard by which you may obtain power, the Sith code proclaims that only by sacrificing your humanity and indulging in your psychotic urges can you obtain freedom, which only further makes you slave to the Force. &quot;At time, I wonder what we would be if the Force While questioning Kreia about the origins of the Sith, &quot;The Jedi Civil War is not the first one of its kind.&quot; &quot;Thousands of year ago, there was another &quot;A faction among the Jedi abandoned &quot;They waged war on their fellow Jedi, a war that raged across the galaxy.&quot; &quot;But these fallen were &quot;Over time, they took on the mantle &quot;The hatred of the Jedi burns &quot;Once there were only Jedi. I wonder what evil was in such days.&quot; &quot;And to think there were once no Jedi at all. In our world, according to Nietzsche, all higher civilization arose This is what is known as Master Morality. Then, those who were oppressed in opposition to power and saw themselves as superior by not desiring power. This is what is known as Slave Morality. In dialectic terms, Master Morality can be considered the original thesis on morality. And Slave Morality was formed as a reaction forming an antithesis. What is unique to the Star Wars universe And Master Morality, with the Sith, was formed, as a reaction, becoming the antithesis. Schiller dialectic can be understood as a thesis given rise to reaction, and an antithesis, that contradicts or negates the thesis However a synthesis is not simply the 'middle road'. It is supposed to overcome the two opposed thesis. The problem is that a synthesis has never occurred between &quot;It is simply important to me that the infighting amongst these Jedi &quot;I do not care which one triumphs, I only want the universe to settle down for a while, catch its breath.&quot; &quot;All these constant crises are getting somewhat repetitive.&quot; This is echoed by Jolee Bindo when he has a talk with Carth. &quot;So Jolee, you decided to come out &quot;I guess you realized this was worth coming out of retirement for, huh?&quot; &quot;Yeah, that's right, sonny. The Sith are the greatest evil to hit the galaxy since, well, the Mandalorians.&quot; And they're the worst thing since Exar Kun. Bla ba bla, etectra, etectra, extectra. &quot;Okay, old man, you lost me there. Are you trying to make a point?&quot; &quot;Look, everybody always figures the time they live in &quot;But tyrant and heroes rise and fall, and historians sort out the pieces.&quot; &quot;Malak is a tyrant who should be stopped. &quot;Eventually it'll come around again, but I'd rather not wait that long.&quot; &quot;So we do what we have to do, and we try to stop the Sith.&quot; &quot;But don't start thinking this war - your war - &quot;That's an interesting theory, but I don't buy it.&quot; &quot;The Republic stands for something; it stood for something &quot;You believe whatever you need to to get you through this, sonny.&quot; &quot;The bottom line is we both want This discussion references a MUCH larger problem than Jolee even At the end of the game, And she gives a very interesting answer. &quot;It is said that the Force has a will. It has a destiny for us all.&quot; &quot;I wield it but it uses us all and that is abhorent to me.&quot; &quot;Because I hate the Force. I hate that it seems to have a will, that it would The important part is the end portion that the Force creates It is as though everyone is being manipulated Let's take for example the setup of the Leia is giving the Death Star plans to R2D2, and is accompanied by C3P0, Both droids end up in the hands &quot;Wow. What are the chances of that happening? &quot;Remember we're talking about the Force here.&quot; &quot;At this point, Malak himself &quot;Good point.&quot; &quot;I call it luck.&quot; &quot;In my experience there's no such thing as luck.&quot; &quot;But in one trained in the Force, you know that true coincidences are rare.&quot; This manipulation to create balances has &quot;With all due respect master, is he not the Chosen One?&quot; &quot;Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?&quot; &quot;So the prophecy says.&quot; &quot;A prophecy, misread, could have been.&quot; &quot;You were the chosen one.&quot; &quot;It was said that you would join the Sith, not join them.&quot; &quot;Bring Balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness.&quot; And how did the Force achieve this 'balance' with Anakin? By having the entire galaxy fight in a war, controlled on both sides by the Sith, have the entire Jedi Order annihilated, then wait 20 years of Sith oppression and only when only THEN, as Anakin sees his own son COUNTLESS death for balance. That is what Kreia found abhorrent. And unlike what the word 'balance' suggests, this doesn't mean an equality between the Light and the Dark like some sort of scale but simply an eradication of all those that use the Dark Side of the Force, as And this brings up the question of whether or not there is any free will at The Handmaiden and Kreia ponder on this question. &quot;The Force can drive others, but there is choice, is there not?&quot; &quot;Ah, but at what point does the power &quot;If there is no choice in the Force then our teachings and our &quot;You have taken a complicated question, servant of Atris, What is interesting is that despite all the talks of fate and destiny, the Star Wars movies put emphasis on the value of choice as a theme. &quot;You are fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.&quot; &quot;It is unavoidable. It is your destiny.&quot; &quot;Luke, you can destroy the Emperor. He has forseen this.&quot; &quot;It is your destiny.&quot; &quot;Join me, and together, we can rule the galaxy as father and son.&quot; &quot;It is the only way.&quot; The greater good... For example, in the original movie, after Han Solo got paid &quot;It's not over yet.&quot; &quot;It is for me sister. I ain't in it for this revolution and I'm not in it &quot;You need not worry about a reward. &quot;So, you got your reward and you're just leaving then?&quot; &quot;That's right, yeah.&quot; &quot;I got some old debts that I have to pay off with this stuff.&quot; &quot;Even if I did, you don't think I'd be a fool to stick around here, do you?&quot; &quot;Come on, why don't you look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.&quot; &quot;They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.&quot; &quot;What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?&quot; &quot;Besides, attacking that battle station isn't my idea of courage. More like suicide.&quot; &quot;Alright, take care of yourself Han. &quot;What's wrong?&quot; &quot;Oh, it's Han. I don't know. I thought he would change his mind.&quot; &quot;He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him.&quot; The opposite selfish choice can also be seen with Anakin when he has to choose between the Jedi and the Sith. &quot;If you want to become a complete &quot;Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.&quot; &quot;Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi.&quot; &quot;Learn to to know Dark Side of the Force (God I love these evil smiles.) &quot;What did you say?&quot; &quot;Use my knowledge, I beg you.&quot; &quot;I'm going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.&quot; &quot;Of course, you should, but you're not sure if their intentions, are you?&quot; &quot;You have great wisdom, Anakin. &quot;You are under arrest, my Lord.&quot; &quot;Anakin, I told you it would come to this. &quot;The oppression of the Sith will never return. You have lost.&quot; &quot;He's a traitor!&quot; &quot;He is a traitor. Arrgh.&quot; &quot;I have the power to save the one you love.&quot; YOU MUST CHOOOOOSE &quot;Don't listen to him, Anakin.&quot; &quot;Don't let him kill me.&quot; &quot;Anakin, help me, help me! &quot;I can't hold out any longer.&quot; &quot;I'm going to end this, once and for all.&quot; &quot;You can't. He must stand trial.&quot; &quot;He has control of the &quot;I'm too weak, oh, don't kill me, please.&quot; &quot;It's not the Jedi way. He must live!&quot; (Windu consciously makes the choice to violate the Jedi Code, knowing it is wrong) &quot;Please don't!&quot; &quot;I need him.&quot; &quot;Please don't!&quot; &quot;NOOO&quot; &quot;What have I done?&quot; &quot;Commander Cody. The time has come. Execute Order 66.&quot; &quot;Yes my Lord.&quot; &quot;The Force binds all things.&quot; &quot;The smallest push, the smallest touch sends echoes throughout life.&quot; &quot;These acts of cruelty may have more severe repercussion than you know, or can see.&quot; &quot;Execute Order 66.&quot; And what is even more insane is that it's not simply the wars between the Jedi &quot;And then with Anakin, kind of duplicating the &quot;Instead of destroying &quot;Again, it's like poetry, so that they rhyme.&quot; &quot;Every stance kind of rhymes with the last one.&quot; &quot;Hopefully it'll work.&quot; &quot;It's like poetry so that they rhyme.&quot; &quot;It's like poetry so that they rhyme.&quot; &quot;It's like poetry so that they rhyme.&quot; &quot;It's like poetry so that they rhyme.&quot; &quot;It's like poetry so that they rhyme.&quot; &quot;It's like poetry so that they rhyme.&quot; Star Wars is possibly It ensures that there will always It is an Eternal Recurrence. The same events will keep From an audience perspective, there's nothing wrong with But... from the perspective That is what Kreia hated about the Force. After leaving the Jedi Order and forming the Sith triumvirate, Traya But... they were never completed. The Academy on Malachor V, was left by After the activation of the Mass Shadow super weapon during the final moments of the Mandalorian Wars on Malachor V, it could be used as a weapon that builds up echoes that &quot;Now she seeks to create a new echo, a wound in the Force. &quot;The death of one can send echoes &quot;If not checked, then it spreads until nothing is left.&quot; &quot;It creates places where the Force is difficult to hear, and difficult to find one's way.&quot; &quot;It will deafen all who are touched by the Force until no life is left. The number of people that would survive this event would be very low. But the galaxy would be freed from the influence of the Force. However, before this plan could be enacted, &quot;There are dark places in the galaxy, &quot;But I did not walk alone. &quot;But my will was not law. &quot;I was casted down. Stripped of my power. Exiled. And fell into darkness.&quot; From such disagreements, Kreia was born and sought a new purpose. &quot;Know that there was once a Darth Traya, &quot;What do you wish to hear? &quot;That I felt the call of the Sith? &quot;That for every good work that &quot;That perhaps what the greatest of &quot;What would it matter now. At last, you understand, tiny Jedi. &quot;You. Who are you? What are you doing on this ship?&quot; &quot;Enough. What did you see in the web of world that have died. &quot;I see the death of the galaxy. Of life.&quot; &quot;At first, I thought it was just conquest but it's more terrible than that. You are a wasted pawn of the Republic, young one. You could have &quot;Now you understand the magnitude of what is being done.&quot; &quot;I know you. Not even the markings &quot;I? You think I seek the destruction &quot;I do not want to win our war like this, little Jedi. &quot;Because she proclaims to no longer follow the Sith. Stripped of her power and connection to the Force, only one solution remained: to destroy the Jedi and Sith and to create a &quot;I am Kreia, and I am your rescuer, as you are mine.&quot; The foundation of Kreia's philosophy can be seen in her name. Names have a great importance in the Star Wars universe. When someone falls to the Dark Side, &quot;Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth Vader.&quot; &quot;Your father, was seduced by the Dark Side of the Force. &quot;I've accept the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.&quot; &quot;That name no longer has any meaning for me.&quot; &quot;Kreia? Argh. That is not her name.&quot; When Kreia was a Jedi Master, she was known as Arren Kae. Then, when she became a Sith Lord, she was known as Darth Traya. The name 'Kreia' is not random. It is a collection of several parts of Her lightsaber equally reflects this union of opposite. But, understanding the creation of a synthesis between the As a character with its own past history, the Exile is rather important to the After joining the Mandalorian Wars and fighting alongside Revan as a general, the Exile used a superweapon the Mass Shadow generator during the &quot;I dreamt of Malachor. &quot;A tattered remnants of our fleet. &quot;The Mandalorians couldn't resist. &quot;Yet this time there were no reinforcements for either side.&quot; &quot;Revan had been delayed &quot;And beyond Malachor there were no Mandalorians left to die.&quot; &quot;I remember standing on the bridge, standing next to you watching the destruction &quot;I remember the look you had when you looked at me. &quot;Events moved quickly, even in my dreams. And then the memory. &quot;And then the echo, lingering. The sound I awaken to in my nightmares.&quot; &quot;The situation forced your hand. You realized that unless &quot;None of us realized the magnitude of what we unleashed. &quot;There is a world in the Outer Rim, surrounded by Mass Shadows.&quot; Past the graveyard of mandalorian warships, &quot;To walk on its surface is to feel it crush every cell of your being.&quot; &quot;It is like being buried alive until it seems like you will never breathe again.&quot; &quot;What manner of creature would have birthed such a thing?&quot; &quot;Nothing human, to be sure.&quot; But unbeknownst to all, this was a plan of conversion, orchestrated by Revan, to make all those who followed him into war turn to the Dark Side and swear loyalty to him, so that he may attack the Republic years later. &quot;Observation, I do not believe that the Mandalorians were the true target at Malachor.&quot; &quot;I believe that the intention was &quot;I don't know if you examined the records of the deaths on Malachor, but you cannot escape that many of the Jedi and &quot;Observation: I believe that Revan was cleaning house at Malachor V.&quot; &quot;What ones did not die became Revan's allies against the Republic.&quot; Faced with the overwhelming death of allies after the activation of the Mass Shadow weapon, everyone was forced to either turn to the Dark Side or DIE. &quot;There is a place in the galaxy where the Dark Side of the Force runs strong.&quot; &quot;It is something of the Sith, but it was fueled by war.&quot; &quot;It corrupts all that walks on its surface, drowns them &quot;Revan knew the power of such places and the power in making them.&quot; &quot;They can be used to break the will of others, of Jedi, &quot;Did you never wonder how Revan &quot;The Mandalorian Wars were a series Culminating in a final atrocity that no Jedi could walk away from, save one.&quot; &quot;And that is what I sought to understand.&quot; &quot;How one can turn away from such power, give up the Force and still live.&quot; &quot;But I see what happened now.&quot; &quot;It is because you had no choice.&quot; &quot;We did not cut you off from the Force. &quot;The screams of countless thousands, &quot;Their lives still scream on the surface of that dead planet, and within you.&quot; &quot;To hear the Force over such pain, it is not possible. &quot;It was too much for any Jedi to endure. &quot;And it is a wonder why you did not die there &quot;You cut yourself off because you had to if you were to survive. This is what makes the Exile so unique, compared to all the Jedi and Sith. Rather than destroy its ego to be in tune with the Force, like all Jedi, or sacrifice its humanity by indulging in psychotic urges for power, like all Sith, the Exile could use the Force as it desired, using the Force as a tool, not as a slave. &quot;Because you are a Jedi who turned away &quot;In you, I see the potential to see the Force die, &quot;You are beautiful to me, Exile.&quot; &quot;A dead spot in the Force, an emptiness in which its will might be denied.&quot; &quot;In times past, and in times future, there are Jedi who will stop listening &quot;And those, as in the past, such as I, who have had the Force striped from them.&quot; &quot;But no Jedi *ever* made the choice you did. To sever ties so completely, so utterly, that it leaves a wound in the Force. &quot;And that is why I chose you.&quot; &quot;You are not a Jedi. You are not Sith, not truly. And it is for that that I love you.&quot; &quot;I would have killed the galaxy to preserve you. I would have let the galaxy die.&quot; &quot;You are more rare than you know. At the end of the game, there is a path that Kreia desired Rather than destroy Malachor V, you can remain there and become a teacher, attracting the next generation of Force-Sensitive &quot;You make take one of the ships that orbit Malachor and depart from this place, or you may remain here on Malachor V and wait &quot;Then you shall become a teacher as I once was.&quot; &quot;I am proud. It is difficult to turn away from battle By becoming a beacon to all Force-Sensitives that feel the echo, and for them to remain on Malachor V, Kreia's teaching would persist beyond her death and save the galaxy... &quot;You must understand that the general would not wish &quot;Their presence is needed to stabilize the galaxy. However, despite what Kreia desired, The Jedi Council was rebuilt and nothing was learned. A true synthesis was never created, The original Star Wars movies were meant to be as Anakin was prophesized to finally bring balance to the Force and destroy the Sith. This is why there weren't supposed to be any movies made after Return of the Jedi. Luke refused to forsake his friends yet also refused to fall to the Dark Side, like his father before him. Luke was destined to reform the Jedi into something familiar but also new. In the Expanded Universe, this is exactly what Luke did with the New Jedi Order. However, now that Disney has complete ownership of the Star Wars franchise, This war... will truly... never... end. &quot;It's time for the Jedi to end.&quot; Star Wars may be a fantasy in space, But it cannot be denied that it is a cultural touchstone, Paying tribute to past old myths Using the Hero's Journey, along with *MANY* cultural archetypes, Merging it all to create a true monomyth that endlessly repeats for all time. And while Kreia's philosophy can be understood it also serves as a criticism of our own dialectic system of morality. Kreia is not simply an amazingly well-written female character but a person that stood alone, among the dualistic morality that &quot;Take what strength you may steal from me. That is all I need be to you.&quot; I'm happy that this project is finally finished. It has been a very long one. If I ever die, then this video will serve as a record of my philosophy as well as a piece of art/analytical piece regarding Kotor 2 in the canon of video games and the cultural zeitgeist of Star Wars for generations to come. I only hope that you may find whatever information that may enrich your life.
