Can you beat Frostbite Caves Hey Guys, you're probably well as you know Frostbite caves is a very chilly world..but I also decided to have an Unlike the last 3 worlds, what in the frozen blu ray and if that wasn't enough, there are i think you'll be QUITE IMPRESSED what i so strap yourselves in because in day 1, penny data suggests it will block jokes aside, frostbite caves causes more problems than necessary with plants having these popsicle-looking plants act as an obstacle peashooter can't shoot through them, despite so i deployed kernel corn to hail mary and despite being given these pre-planted nuts, they kinda just got in the and replaced them with snapdragon we beat the level and get given this pebble don't look now, penny, but rest in peas- i suggest we call on hot ugh why are you talking to me like I'm 5 YEARS even though we're forced to take hot potato so i'll have to use my very much which nicely pairs up with these and whilst im getting setup at the back, i these handy pointy dudes, force the zombies to which helps to pre-plan a setup every so often this cold breeze will fly across we set our torchwoods into blowtorch My data suggests hurrikale penny stop HOLDING MY HAND through the game- the guy's a real blow hard... dave you better watch your mouth- day 3, and we're already at i get given peashooters...just...not fast enough After discussing my "repeater-peashooter the game is giving me repeater, so BE USING HIM IN LEVELS, but just anyway we lost- yea so day 3 has already stumped us as force the zombies to clump up, making it too so after multiple failures, i resorted clutch, getting us passed the level, not day 4 started off the same with building however we came across this new who has a knack for launching snowballs as long as you have hot plants like burning tree we unlocked vasebreaker...okay My feet are really cold... time to turn up the heat! i who wrote this obvious dialogue? let's pick a peck of pepper-pults! GUESS WHAT, we got ANOTHER conveyer level let's see who we get...2 plants...is that it?- there wasn't much to bring up here so on day 6 we have to survive with...most well i mean how many is most- 2 slots...is that it...tallnut, i said luckily one of our selected plants was sunflower so i just had to think about who was i obviously chose snapdragon for the area damage however what i accidentally realised is that actually warm up nearby plants, which i somehow but it turns out the snapdragons fire aura strikes global cooling is the pits, please note, i have now replaced the flamethrower power-up...whatever SKIP with my newfound knowledge of snapdragon i primarily used him to conquer day 7 and there were also these frozen to try and deal some damage to far away targets, i combined snapdragon with peashooter day 8...another conveyor day 9 introduced...um....bird- who has this really cool mechanic allowing it to fly over the wet floor signs Unfortunately they don't work the same as can take them down with ease, so I deployed you are seriously not doing this to me corn- as long as you have a huge swarm of cave zombies sure are hard headed i propose we deploy CHARD GUARD- it seems like for every &quot;new it then follows up with a conveyer level however that's not we're doing as we get meaning there is a CHANCE we can beat this the problem i was having in the early waves was and i wasn't getting peashooter and cause my beavers...to immediately run away- what's even harder is if you EVEN MANAGE to conveyor belt decides to help you out a bit and which means that the peashooters i only plants i have to last for the rest this level took a lot of trial and the first few plants always shuffle between having a slim chance to show up later the order the zombies appear seems to be the spawning in the fourth row, the first peashooter a second peashooter is placed to wipe out the auto killed by the beaver, which was INTENTIONAL is used to save the top lawnmower by plant by this point we have 3 rows with 2 peashooters time to take out these 3 zombies back to another peashooter is used for the but then i fumbled and wasted this plant food... After not wasting this plant food and saving right at the back to kill the bird normally, final wave and kill the remaining zombies with day 10....OUT OF THIRTY- day 11 wants me to yet again beat the so it'll probably be sunflower, pepperpult- SUN-SHRoom??? WHY ARE YOU HERE...w...SUN SHROOM- it didn't help that the other plants so i decided to fully send it with only sunflower this level in particular sucked to these frozen idiots breaks the level wasn't necessarily too it made me want to just punch but we managed to get through day 12 PEASHOOTER LEVEL finally something exciting the snapdragon army came back, along with this but this was actually a smart strategy as i can stun larger threats next to the snapdragons to get and this method worked all the way ignored the butter for some reason speaking of dragons, i was supposed dragon related game which i will however they back out because my views so instead this video is sponsored guy...SUCKS! didn't expect that did you- so mr ghostplace over here, decided to challenge me who if he wins i'm forced to get a peashooter has to go out in public wearing a freddy my punishment definitely seemed being ahead by 30,000 subs it would So WHAT ARE YOU DOING! HELP ME BEAT help me win guys, i need to prove him wrong- anyway in day 13, we had to protect dave's flowers the middle of caveman land, how are these dumb we beat the level using the before and, oh a pre-picked plant day 15, protect fireman SAM from being eaten for some reason, i thought chomper would be a good it turns out it was the opposite as this zombie and this wasn't just on one occasion, we died again, and again, until i decided i we got through the remaining i did all that work for a brown rock please note the strange stone tablet, it appears ...tap to continue? what, do you want me to translate this or you in trouble....BIG trouble...i don't know why day 16...conveyer level...which but repeater! you said repeater... day 17, fume shroom? what's with this level was nothing impressive to look at with however this cactus was trapped in i wish these prehistoric zombies DATA SUGGEST STUNION WOULD MAKE A GREAT PLANT- day 18 was yet another conveyer citron what are you doing here? survive with most plants picked, here we go what with having access to 4 different additional plants didn't really cause an issue, so in day 20, we continued to until these frozen imps started appearing on BIG TARZAN ZOMBIE, over here pushes they aren't really that impressive down within seconds, and as for and look we even get a souvenir from him, gross- user dave, i've detected an w-w-warning user dave, i am it'll be a cold day in Really? heck- time to unleash fire peashooter- wait what the- ok i didn't expect this to happen but i cant really complain, besides its a conveyor it's still a garden warfare plant so it counts Thankfully we're also given snapdragon on or i should say a heatwave, stroke.... this level gave me heatstroke- day 22, crocodile...why?...me don't know- although we did end up seeing chicken zombie back in the wild weasel fetish...and i don't wanna snapdragon is easily able to poach these day 23, protect orange day 24, make me 2,500 sun in all honesty, i nearly forgot about i spammed sunflowers everywhere and finally we arrived at day 25...which doesn't matter anymore because there's PENNY! what we need right now enjoy that fatass- i recommend we call on rotobaga- who woulda thought, another conveyer level other than being a purple helicopter there's nothing of interest day 26...what da f- sun shroom HOW DO YOU KEEP SHOWING UP- this level forced rotobaga into my loadout, despite me NEVER wanting to use it because but after snapdragon and cactus spamming oh, i guess he gave up day 27, save the roto, boto, moto moto- so far snapdragon has been enough to just take out some chompers to guard there and....um okay well i guess i can just place a Let's play a game gargantuar! I'll give you sunflower, peashooter, sunflower- OKAY HE REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THE GAME- look guys we can talk about this, we just i was RIGHT THERE- okay guys, i think it's obvious that this level build up a powerful team over the 4 flags, however There's not a lot of damage I can dish I didn't think it would come to NIGHTCAP that's right, nightcap is here with she packs a huge punch throwing poisonous with being able to plant more and more nightcaps close to eating the endangered plants and we got day 28, peashooter time! you already know whats happening, snapdragon x this was barely a challenge my beaver had to carry at the end wiping out this gargantuar but THAT DIDN'T survive with the given plants...oh here we go, let me guess sunshroom? Chilli oh yeah that'll do- with fire pea alone we was able to take genuinely overpowered considering he however, with day 29 complete it meant we finally arrived at day 30...it just doesn't have bossfight time- PENNY, MY TACO... user dave...f*** the taco it's time to FIGHT DR. ZOMBOSS and she's damn right, lets yet again another bossfight that who even asked you to be here- but after coating himself in ice like 30 times, which dropped the key, to the lost next time as there was FROSTBITE CAVES and like the video if you want to see oh ARE YOU KIDDING ME-
