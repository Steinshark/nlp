Narrator: Recognize this hairline? It belongs to Eleven on &quot;Stranger Things.&quot; Her signature buzz cut returned for the show's fourth season. Millie Bobby Brown couldn't shave her head this time around, so it was TV and movie wigs like these standard of detail, one that keeps rising with the advent of HD and 4K cameras. And at Wigmaker, Rob Pickens' studio, it's a long road to creating a hyper-realistic wig like Eeven's. One that starts here. Wig makers can't just measure different parts of the actor's head for size. They need to record the nuances of shape, and even the template of the hairline. That means a hyper-customized fitting. - [Rob] The initial fitting with the actor is our time to capture as - [Narrator] First, they of the actor's head with a head wrap, using cellophane and a lot of tape. Then, they get even more granular, tracing the intricate growth - [Rob] All of the marking are our roadmap for the entire process. Everything from where to maybe we mark they have quite a slope at their neckline below the occipital. - [Narrator] The head wrap which they shape to match the actor's head using a mix of cork and stuffing. - [Rob] This process is So, think of it like padding a pillow. - [Narrator] This step is laborious, but once it's done, a production shooting anywhere in the world can call in to have a wig made for an actor, even if the actor can't - [Rob] We're paying of the lace, how it's fitting the block. This is where we start to dart and shape it to fit the actor's head. - [Narrator] Just as the to the finest detail, the of production wigs has - [Rob] They used cotton and it didn't show up because Film is much more So, that's the thing, just the hairlines have gotten finer, - [Narrator] The same that's sometimes used to - [Rob] It used to be a - [Narrator] On Eleven's of a super-light, semi-opaque silk to make it look like her scalp Sometimes silk isn't enough so the hair team will under the wig's foundation. That was the case on &quot;Blonde,&quot; concealed Ana de Armas' darker hairline, and on &quot;Pam and Tommy,&quot; under Lily James' wig naturally higher hairline. The same considerations the ventilating process, where they stitch in each hair one by one. - [Rob] We use a variety one of which is called point knotting, which involves a particular so that the cuticle down as close to the scalp as possible. - [Narrator] This technique like Eleven's to be It's also useful for the back It's all about matching the idiosyncratic natural patterns of the actor's head. - [Rob] So for example, This particular actor grew down, so the hair was knotted that direction. We actually tie in crown We've built it and knotted it naturally so that you can part the hair just as you would your own head of hair. - [Narrator] As for the hair itself-- - [Rob] Hairdressers use all the time to use for - [Narrator] But it won't which require real human hair. - [Rob] Synthetic hair has more of a sheen to it than natural human hair, which is kind of something - [Narrator] Sometimes Rob to mimic the soft baby strands Like for Olivia Wilde's wig and Ana de Armas' in &quot;Blonde.&quot; The hair they choose also When making hair pieces Rob might have to convey try to disguise, like aging or ill health. That was the case for Tom which showed the aging mobster at a time when he was living with syphilis. - [Rob] The hair texture situation of &quot;Capone&quot; and was actually a bit sickly - [Narrator] Capone's hair so Rob thinned out the density and temples, and gave in some areas, with a Then comes the coloring process, which requires a close and how that might interact with the wig. - [Rob] Reds can be quite If we create a red wig over the entire thing, A lot of our job is and figuring out how that's going to play in the final product. For example, for &quot;Mank,&quot; was going to be shot in black and white. So, when I was doing in choosing the blonde of samples and actually put them on camera against similar backgrounds before we ever put a of the wig to make sure that the blonde wasn't going to look gray, it wasn't going to look too white, it had enough dimension at the root to look like it was grounded in her head. - [Narrator] There were on &quot;Stranger Things.&quot; Because of the way the show was filmed, everything showed up darker - [Rob] His wig was actually ash brown, but it was more of a green ash. So, when we do more of a green ash and then they put a darker filter on it, it appears a much darker brown. - [Narrator] Meanwhile, some period pieces call for very era-specific hair colors that we may not see - [Rob] There's a very that you notice in older the oxidative dye was - [Narrator] When the actor's it's even more crucial of the wig's design from texture to color. For the wigs in &quot;Blonde,&quot; Jaime Leigh McIntosh sourced natural density and tightness it'd later get styled into And to achieve Pam's almost in &quot;Pam and Tommy,&quot; the show's combined four different shades Those four shades created little preventing the high-level blonde from looking flat on camera. - [Rob] We can use as many upwards of five or six, depending on what we're creating, but at least three. So, here we're just to add a little bit of depth - [Narrator] For &quot;The the same technique on for Michelle Pfeiffer as Betty Ford. - [Rob] Each of those wigs has anywhere from five to six colors of the previous wig into so that way, you're not jarred, her going from a dark brown Making sure those were rooted in the same color palette was really important. To look like it was a natural progression of the same human being - [Narrator] Sometimes multiple versions of the exact same wig. - [Rob] These are a variety of stunt wigs we've created for photo They're cutting from a in the custom wig to the stunt The hair better look exactly the same as it did in the shot before. - [Narrator] But creating identical wigs is notoriously difficult. - [Rob] We do that through a using oxidative dyes, and different texturizing that we get the wig right down to the root to look exactly like the - [Narrator] It can get wigs to hero wigs with Hero wigs usually get get synthetic hair for durability. - [Rob] They need to hold up down the stairs, jumping - [Narrator] Synthetic hair between takes, and stunt in general, with minimal application processes for comfort and safety. - [Rob] You want to use in case something goes That wig needs to be removed quickly. - [Narrator] Wigmakers multiple hero wigs, like which the team had to resetting and remolding after each wear. To allow for this, the team different matching wigs When applying the wig, the Sarah Hindsgaul, had to on top of Millie's armpit-length hair, which was all bundled up She didn't go with the That would've added bulk, - [Rob] It's a variation called a fracture wrap, to really create tension and lay the hair as flat as possible on the head. - [Narrator] Even a look required duplicate wigs, and painstaking work at to pull it off convincingly on screen. The stakes are just that They can either take us out of the story or keep us immersed in it.
