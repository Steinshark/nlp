Welcome to Sad Boyz, a podcast - I'm Jarvis. - Were you just doing my line? - OK, better. - Jarvis didn't say a word up front. My hand is in Jordan's ass. - My other hand. You can't see. Yeah. I just make him yap. - I'm talking to myself, is this podcast. even do a 1% impression of you. - [JARVIS] Same. And I have talked to you and I can not even close. I'm the same way, I haven't figured it out. 'Cause I can't do you... - I can do other people that we know. our impression of the other person It's like when you look into a mirror and you see the reflection of yourself, but that's what your own And when you see a photo of yourself, - &quot;What did you do?!&quot; Or you hear your own voice through your own ear canals and you're like, &quot;Get rid of him. I'm still getting - hmm. Am I used to that? I am used to it, but it's like a third person. Like, there's me in real life and then there's the me where I'm listening to it OK, yeah, that's what But that's not what I'm sure if I listen back to, like... like one of our meetings or something, I'd feel like, &quot;That's a little bit more But even - I feel like... uh, Sad Boyz Jordan/Jarvis is very... different than Jarvis Johnson: Gold Jarvis - or Jordan Adika-channel Jordan. Obviously, it's a performance; it has a - the cadence, the snap, the jazz. was performing a solo YouTube video It would just be too - like, &quot;Shut up. I gotta make a joke.&quot; - &quot;I gotta pause you.&quot; - &quot;Up-bup-bup-bup!&quot; Yeah. &quot;Let's run that back.&quot; I do wonder how many other shows... We'll do a cut here and there, but the cut is usually 'cause we, uh... like, we're trying to remember or, uh, because we say - [JARVIS] Or you leak my address. - [JARVIS] As you often do. [JACOB] Usually I'm just cutting out - Yeah. If you feel like I'm not that's actually from the edit. Jacob secretly told Jordan so Jordan adds 10 extra hours of throwing in things That's true, actually, yeah. When I say that thing about those people. Mmhmm. Well, when you say it like that, it sounds like you're doing a hate crime. Let's just say, off mic, - we both agree we're on the same page. - OK. But they are like that. Mm, I don't know who we're talking about. Say no more. I will say more. I'm not on board. - And, hey... Me neither. It seems like you're trying to wink, but... are you OK? Oh, man. Oh. I'm fine. You look like you've been Your eyes start to twitch. What do you mean? Dude, I hate that, that my mum was right about spending too much time with screens. My eyes are getting weaker. My eyes twitch. My back hurts. You know what's wild? Is, one, I remember the first time my eye twitched, I was like a teenager and I remember going to and I could just see my eye throbbing. And I was like, &quot;Oh, no!&quot; That's when you know Right. That's when I was like, &quot;My eyes are failing.&quot; But then I got, uh - You know, I did this internship in, like, college. Started to get headaches, 'cause I was staring at 'cause I was writing code. And then I got, uh, my - I went to an optometrist Um, and they're mostly of the type of issue I have. It's like with my focusing muscles, - are weaker. They're weak and pathetic, but it causes strain. - [JARVIS] And so I have 20/20 vision - I do have contacts. Um... But historically, I never wore them. I did wear them for a bit in 2021. I also feel like I remember us, when we first worked together, you wearing glasses more. Yeah, I used to wear glasses more. But what happened was that, when I quit working in tech... Well, first of all, &quot;It's funny, because would never have come up Right, yeah, sure. &quot;Because it's only that you're staring at screens all day.&quot; Um... - And I'm like, &quot;OK, cool.&quot; - [JARVIS] Well, because - I have 20/20 vision, but I'm overcompensating to get there, and thus tiring my eyes out. And ever since I quit working in tech, my eye strain issues have been so much less pronounced. Even though I still I don't always have to wear my glasses. I only wear my glasses when I'm... I can kinda feel it coming on. And then I'll be like, &quot;OK, Yeah, you can see the eyes shaking. Yeah. &quot;I'm about to do a Uh, an extended scroll, so to speak. And that's when I'll bring out I really want to make - RuneScape joke for you, but I already spent &quot;Wildy.&quot; I already burned that token. And everything else I know 'cause I was playing at the original time Because I'm not a loser. - [JARVIS] Yeah, that's fair. I wanna give a shoutout My apologies for making mouth sounds. I can't help it. It's just what my mouth does. But we are making attempts Uh, but when I do read it does feel like someone has put on, like, special glasses where they can They'll just be like, &quot;Ah, god, my ears! And I'm like, please just Like, when I listen to it, I don't - It's like when somebody's looking - It's just that, uh, you know, we try. We're not out to get you. We're not doing this on purpose. We're, you know, learning and growing. - He's out to get you. maybe the Patreon version. Oh, can you imagine? That would be so - That's like America. If you, like, become rich and famous, You have all these privileges, like people don't treat you the same way. It's like a subscription service You get the privilege of The privilege of not dying from a splinter, from not going into horrible debt from some sort of medical emergency. - It is amazing. - and treat you differently. - to run away from the bullet. Before shooting, going, &quot;Ah, I saw the Black.White thing. &quot;Nice. I learned nothing. - Bang, bang, bang.&quot; - Man, I feel like - - &quot;Bang, bang, bang.&quot; They should say that. By the way... Did I pitch you already on my idea of we just do one episode of Sad Boyz where... no matter the content of the show, the thumbnail is us both and it's &quot;We Stole - I do think that's fun. - That's one of the options. then yeah, we just go wild. There's be a - it's like, um... It's like opening Pokemon cards. a rare title and thumbnail. - &quot;Ooh, I got a cop's gun!&quot; - Which, also speaking of... Sometimes, and oftentimes, actually, you will see various because we use the A/B testing feature, 'cause we're still of thumbnails make them most clickable, and yada-yada, as we try to make things sustainable. I think that people, like... assume that... whatever we put out, it's gonna be the same amount Like, people don't think about the, um, on the backend, &quot;How do we make this relevant? How do we make it so that the algorithm shows it to the people And, you know, it's a war (laughs) that we're fighting every day Thursday groupchat? the forum in ancient Greece, you know? (laughs) They're like, &quot;I think...&quot; &quot;I think skateboarding should be legal.&quot; Right. &quot;No more coliseum stuff. What if we just did cool tricks?&quot; I guess at some point, - &quot;No more coliseum stuff.&quot; When did coliseum stuff end? 'Cause they still have it, - do bloodsport. You can't, like, book a - - The splash zone. &quot;Yo, dude, I got the fuckin' These seats are ass, bro.&quot; - It is... where I can see what's down there.&quot; It's weird to think that, we all had to go, &quot;Just no more duels.&quot; - Mmhmm. - &quot;The duels, that's a crime, actually.&quot; Weehawken and shoot - Or, like, Alexander Hamilton. Yeah. What was that about? In American history, that break out in the House and Senate. And it affects people's political careers. Well, some of which because they die, like, for example, Alexander Hamilton. Hugely impacted his career. Yeah, dying? Much like, um, Like, they went to this island in New Jersey and then, like, with a doctor, like you're going to a boxing match And you bring a gun, and you guys just point your gun I don't understand... What's the doctor gonna do? It's like the 1700s. Why doesn't every - ? That's how I wanna go. - Yeah. A duel? Like, within the 2020s. [ANASTASIA] Did you guys know - called The Last Duel? - With, uh... - What?! - Adam Driver?! It's very good, and a little upsetting. Yeah, it's kinda like a Rashomon-type &quot;same story 3 ways, - Like, &quot;Well, the one that's not lying.&quot; For me, The Last Duel is about, uh, when I was in middle school - [JORDAN] That's what it's about. and I drew my last card in my last duel. And I said, &quot;It's time to d-d-d-d- d-d-d-d-d- play a different game.&quot; Yeah. &quot;It's time to duel, - [ANASTASIA] You're played by Matt Damon. - Which, eh, kind of an issue. Eh, whitewashing. It happens. Michael B. Jordan plays - Adam Driver's character, which - Yeah, only Michael A. Jordan - He's the white one. No. It's Michael Asian Jordan, Michael Black Jordan, - Oh, right. Michael Black-or-Chinese Jordan. (laughing) Yeah. Speaking of, uh, speaking of card games, Jordan, have you heard of MetaZoo? Um... - Uh, by name. It is a - it came out in 2020. Like, in the beginning as a Kickstarter game - was the type of thing. They basically started - They started pretty strong. &quot;We wanna be a small, successful we say, &quot;No, straight to the top.&quot; Pokemon still around, Um, let me check. - &quot;Is Pokemon still...&quot; Well, apparently they've... - Yeah, my doctor - Saying some stuff about - (cringes). Just getting a call Just gonna ignore that. We will not find out about Pokemon, 'cause my phone is overheating - And your doctors. - Yeah, no. It said - - &quot;From vacation.&quot; He's like, &quot;Hey, it's me. Yeah. &quot;Hi, I'm on island time, - but you are dying of butt disease.&quot; He was like, &quot;Things are great over here. He's a workaholic, man. Um, let me go grab something. Zip. - &quot;Whooooa!&quot; (laughing) Maybe, yeah, a flintlock pistol, But I don't wanna - is that it's the single fire, and if it doesn't kill me If they hit me in the hip. And I'm just like, &quot;Oh, my god! Shit, ow!&quot; [ANASTASIA] Do you know the story of, um, the assassination of President McKinley? [ANASTASIA] He was shot who was a anarchist guy. [ANASTASIA] And McKinley lived - for days afterwards, with all these doctors just poking around, [ANASTASIA] And this is in, so they probably did more damage. That's such a funny idea, that, like, it's weird that we even called it - when it could just be - The fact that you could be a doctor and wear a plague mask - Like, &quot;I don't know, a slug?&quot; being a thing that was like, let's just bleed you out I think that's what I would've figured out. You know? Like, if you just day one, you're like, &quot;So we've got blood, We should take it out? Yeah. &quot;Probably just remove - and see if you're still in pain.&quot; &quot;It's pulsing all the time. OK, so - yeah, it's your heart. - Oh, no. - if you didn't know what a heart was? - Um, so these are MetaZoo cards. MetaZoo is based on, like, crypto - cryptids, and cryptozoology. You can grab some. I'll hold your mic. - Um... Yeah. - This killed Pokemon. [JARVIS] As far as we know. Also, Anastasia's here. - That's the disembodied voice. Well, this one sounds like a slur. Oh, that's actually really funny. (laughs) Uh, if anybody is interested about my interest in MetaZoo, I have my favorite. Always have, of course. - (both laughing) That's, uh, um... Do you remember Fairly OddParents, - the Crimson Chin? Have you seen - do you - Oh, the Nega-Chin? But the way they say it &quot;The Niga-chin!&quot; (both laughing) [CRIMSON CHIN] Oh, don't worry. - [ALL] The Crimson Chin?! - [OFFSCREEN] The Niga-Chin! &quot;One more take? - Should we do another take on that one?&quot; (both laughing softly) - [OFFSCREEN] The Niga-Chin! It's so - what if he takes off - Like, &quot;Whoa!&quot; - I mean, it should be an N, but - But they instead put a cancel sign - over the C for &quot;Chin.&quot; when you say his name now. - Oh, man, such a funny thing. So, MetaZoo, uh... So the issue with MetaZoo is that it was purported... You know, they kinda did this where they would release There's like first editions of the sets, and there's Kickstarter editions Like, to the point where the Kickstarter booster boxes of MetaZoo, like the very first set available, were going for like $20,000. And being bought? Yeah. And so what people especially the way people people invest in cards, for better or for worse, and they're always And then also, if you think about NFTs, there's all this FOMO thing. &quot;You gotta get into the new NFT thing,&quot; &quot;'cause that's how you're &quot;Remember when you didn't last time, And, uh... And so that sort of psychology where just countless YouTube channels and then some sort of big - &quot;Some sort.&quot; Some bigger channels, I think Logan Paul - Um, the Meta - Yeah, a collectibles guru. Uh, Meta... MetaZoo creator actually and offered to send me product. And, uh, never followed up. - And... This was many years ago. Uh, but the news is that, uh, uh, announced yesterday, - MetaZoo is ceasing operations. And the thing about MetaZoo is that none It's like an NFT doesn't make sense, because no one's playing the game. No one's playing the game. It's mostly viewed as an asset And so who's to decide Like, similar - like when that Bored Apes are worth then the whole economy of it crashes. Well, it's 'cause, like, if you start from a place of cynicism and cynical profit, you probably aren't the kind of person You probably don't understand There was, I mean, was the result of people or Marvel/DC, DC especially, realizing, &quot;Hey, people are buying and selling - these collectible comics.&quot; Like, &quot;Action Comics #1 &quot;We should start making comics - that would be collectible-worthy.&quot; Which is why there was so much stuff and then a long-running - Death of Superman-type story. And then, you know... I feel like any adult &quot;But if... everyone... - If all of it's collectible...&quot; &quot;If every $1 is $100,&quot; - (laughs) &quot;isn't it all just now $1?&quot; - Like, it's such an obvious problem. from that era are not worth anything, The majority of them 'cause they were mass-produced to all hell. And they resell them all the time. Like, &quot;16th print of Death of Superman!&quot; - [JARVIS] Hell yeah. - And so, very similar economics happening here. And also, all of the were happening on the secondary market. So, like, MetaZoo isn't making money when one of their boxes sells for $20,000, 'cause they're not eBay. - And so... up until now? Like, doing new releases? They just did - well, The people buying their new product... Again, things like Pokemon and they also have, now, They've just been going Um, and so the machine is already running. But there's no IP. Like, Even Magic: The Gathering is still going, and it's going strong, - But the player community's going strong. And the, uh - If Bored Apes was a MMO - that we played when we were five... - It might have some cachet. There was a Naruto collectible card game or the dead Dragon Ball game Dragon Ball Super stuff, Those still command value, because it's a huge IP And so the overlap There's just something. and it never had any players. - um, bubble. And the bubble essentially popped. - Uh, they did this... I feel like if I was investing heavily in a - bubble cottage industry, I'd be like, &quot;Bubble's getting pretty big. What - &quot;They're fine?&quot; I mean, a similar thing happened It's like, video games Uh, but the issue was that people were... basically, kinda doing insider sales to kind of get media... It'd be like, &quot;Buy...&quot; Like, I buy a, um... uh, a Mario. Like, I buy Mario 3. I then... I buy it sealed somewhere for... $100. OK, that seems reasonable. It's a old game. Sealed, that's cool. Then I get it graded. Uh... appraised, and say And then I have you, - as an investor, say, &quot;That looks pretty valuable. I'm gonna buy it for $500,000.&quot; - Then - - Yeah. Who am I? - Yooooooou... - You lost - yeah, you're Jesus. - 'Eyyy, what's goin' on? 'Ey, you fuckin' martyred me. - You're not gonna fuckin' believe this. - [JARVIS] Um... So then you buy it. You, my friend, buy it for $500,000. Then a new story comes out, saying, &quot;Old copy of Super Mario And then people go, &quot;Oh, - And then that cycle is kind of... So that happened with video games, where the values of sealed video But then there's no sort of &quot;how rare are these things actually...&quot; Who was buying it, - and what was their relationship. And then when there &quot;Oh, OK, maybe these things No one's saying that they don't have value, completely nothing to just That's kind of what happened with MetaZoo. And at the end of the day, no one was buying the game for real. And they, um - Other than people And... Uh, they did, like, a collab - with Hello Kitty recently. And it, like, completely tanked - and didn't sell. - Failing at that is a little weird. - That's the thing. It's a thing where, like, um... There was just nobody really - Like, there was no true fans. And so the people but collectors can only And so I think - Basically, as far as what happened, there's just rumor mill right now. People are saying they owe the for the licensing fees that are unpaid. - They were doing a bad job at - Yeah. &quot;Goodbye Kitty,&quot; She sends the kinda goth one That's what her shooters say - &quot;Goodbye.&quot; - Um... Uh, &quot;'Ey, ja ne. Sayonara, so to speak.&quot; Wow, this guy's traveled. It's a very traveled mafioso. So, now all the prices of it - I bought these at Target, by the way, - 'cause I was at Target the other day. Yeah, 'cause they were sold So I was like, &quot;Wow, MetaZoo's Like, I literally texted Kurtis &quot;Dude, look, there's MetaZoo Just, like, open them, 'cause I'd never 'cause I thought it was a huge, like, - kinda pump-and-dump. - And little did you know... It just felt like it came out of nowhere, and everybody was putting it next to &quot;This will never kill Pokemon,&quot; - and you spitting cereal out. where there's Yeah, where Mr. Poopybutthole was, like, there through all of their stories, &quot;Remember, all of our memories?&quot; 'Cause people started to put and they'd be like, &quot;Yeah, and it's like, &quot;How'd MetaZoo get here?&quot; Like, &quot;Remember when we were and we were all passing around Mothman?&quot; Oh, yeah, dude. Those obvious bots, where a new Ghostbusters will come out and a bot that is playing will be like, &quot;Butterfly tears remembering the first time like a decade before I was born.&quot; - I know. do you guys remember MetaZoo? So, it is one of those things, like a real-life pump-and-dump, because I'm sure a lot of people - It seems that the people... uh, at the top probably The real losers are probably gonna be - [JORDAN] Oh. - [JORDAN] Yeah. - 'cause I spent $12.99 at Target. - You did buy them from Target. For $12.00, mind you. - Maybe we should go nuts; buy a whole set. that this was gonna happen, 'cause I pulled out some holo cards and I was like, &quot;Oh, these are cool. values associated with these cards.&quot; And these aren't first-edition. Uh, and I could not find a single one of those cards And I was like, &quot;Oh, so but there's not even a single person even listing non-first edition. Um, but yeah. So, that's funny. It just overlaps with, you know, And I don't need them to be worth It's just something I genuinely enjoy. And if they're worth $0, I still have my card board, But this, now you're almost free from even getting it checked or being appraised. - It's just so funny. and you're like, &quot;I kinda An evening to myself, nothing to do?&quot; It's so interesting. 'cause I feel like, um... there's gotta be millions and that will just never be sold. Another one of the things in the rumor mill is that the Chinese printer They're high-quality cards. - Like, I was impressed. Yeah. They apparently and I'm like, &quot;Oy!&quot; So, uh, but yeah, that's... That's a fun happening in the corner of things I pay attention to. I mean, I know it's, you know, a vague... I mean, it's a company, I mean, humble beginnings I hope that the people are As far as I know, What I hope is that they were able to run away with a bunch of money, and that people that are screwed over permanently and - That's the thing - I think it's one of those situations like, um... normal employees that are not founders that are probably screwed over. Um, so I hope those people Um, much like I hope the people in all of the layoffs that are happening - and the tech world - - It never ends. than have ever played games. - Yeah. I'm so... It's funny now. I feel like I'm so cynical about anytime I see, well, the word &quot;meta&quot; or &quot;zoo&quot; now. As soon as I saw that, &quot;Oh, is it like Jake Paul this time?&quot; - He, like, launched a thing, and... that sounds like a crypto scam. Which is like, given what happened, kind of feels very similar. Yeah, like &quot;Glum Monkey.&quot; - &quot;Dull Ape-o.&quot; &quot;Fancy Penguins.&quot; - Dude, we... Cool Cats.&quot; It's so crazy that people got behind... Jacob, Google &quot;Cool Cats NFT.&quot; - Google &quot;Cool Cat Derek Savage.&quot; - Ohhhh. &quot;The Cool Cats Home Page.&quot; Go ahead; buy all of them. It's a collection of 9,999 of them. Randomly generated. Let's check this price - I don't know what - Ethereum is, Uh, .98 - that's like $2,000. - Yeah, but it's cool. I actually don't know what it is. Uh, what's the price of a Cool Cat? Yeah, check &quot;.98 ethanol.&quot; - Whoa! OK, $2,300 for a - Refresh me; which one was that? - That was the... - Very cool. I don't - oh, yeah, last sale was - But the thing is it's possible that someone bought these or sold them, and then they've just - but I don't know. Order, uh, price high to low. But its last sale was 8.9 ETH, so the last sale was like $20,000. Wait, do the high-to-low? Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. - Good lord. - (laughs) That's deranged. - For some Newgrounds-ass art. so like $200,000? That's so wild. I mean, hey. - Business expense. because this is all - I mean, I hope... all these people somehow make out like bandit - I don't care. I don't care. Let's... - How much these people make out. That's the final episode. Um, Ben Shapiro... Oh, yes. People that make me happy. The man of the people, - Tom MacDonald had a farm. They made a song. Uh, so for those who don't know, Tom MacDonald, worth a look-up. One of the... One of my favorite grifters. Follows a different... You know, if Ben is Fact-type, then Tom MacDonald is Hog-type. He's Loud-type. He's like a catha - &quot;Cathadian.&quot; He's a Canadian Ameriboo. It is - yeah, he's got but he presents himself Steven Crowder does, has a gun belt, but can't You know Steven Crowder's - like, holster. He can't have a gun. - That's so crazy. I didn't know that we didn't let - They can't have mine. - Ain't nobody taking mine! That's very funny. But I found out about Tom MacDonald because he had a... He had a TikTok about how people are too offended these days, And hey, look, broken clock's I made a Gold video about it, and I didn't know that he was - Ah. roasted some of his music. And... Normally we wouldn't encourage but I do genuinely recommend &quot;WhiteBoy,&quot; for example, - his first breakout single. Where he hangs out in adult school. I found out that he had, because people were, like, &quot;Um... You just don't understand, man. I'm like, &quot;Does he?&quot; Yeah. This lyric where &quot;if white people are racist, then that means all that's his &quot;um, actually&quot; in this new song. - In the new song?! Yeah. Reminder that facts don't - And that's the name of the song, &quot;Facts.&quot; - Uh, yeah. Quickly, Tom MacDonald is - I can't stop. Sorry. EVERY TIME. Say &quot;Tom MacDonald&quot; again? Tom... - Mac... Donald... - [JORDAN] No! - Your nose is bleeding. You can't stop. (both) No, no, no, no, no. - You can't have that. We're gonna take it back! Uh, yeah, he's a little Ameriboo guy except for the fact that instead of with people that are busy Um, you know, they take out &quot;Hey, do you think women and they go, &quot;OK, yeah, man,&quot; Instead, this guy makes sub-mid music. I don't wanna say &quot;mid.&quot; Insulting, but not enough. But also, it's relatively well produced. It is the content of the song One thing he did do that was kinda funny is his beef with, uh... uh, &quot;Matty Raps&quot;? Like, old... old-school Matt - Matt - Mac Lethal! Oh, Mac Lethal. Yeah, He did the, like... Like, &quot;18 styles of rap.&quot; - Peak &quot;lyrical miracle.&quot; And he's got crazy crisp on his mic, &quot;Here I go (gibberish)...&quot; - (rhythmic gibberish) - That kinda shit. &quot;Here-ical diabolical.&quot; But this, uh... It's not as interesting as the but this was genuinely a pretty biting diss track. I don't even understand Neither of them are interesting enough but it was pretty... He kinda popped him on that one. It's the one good or impressive Other than that, his grift is... yelling about a kind of kind of dog-whistling, like, &quot;Hey, you guys feel like there's And then as soon as you walk over he goes, &quot;Well, it's my - I've got a bunch of friends Black friends, too, as well.&quot; Yeah, his stuff is - - I mean, the stuff I've seen - Yeah, he's just like, &quot;Actually, wake up, sheeple. They don't want you And I'm just telling it like it is.&quot; And then when you read because I was trying to figure out the... - Well, there's one reason. We started playing this game on stream, where it was, uh... (laughs) We would search for the phrase - &quot;I don't usually like rap music.&quot; His audience is full of, like, &quot;I'm 65, and I don't know too much but wow, your message really spoke to me. I'm gonna have my kids listen to this.&quot; &quot;Some of this hippity-hop The stuff you're putting here, I take the 'C' away from 'rap' Yeah. &quot;I actually, uh... I think I see - You're achieving what hip-hop always aimed to achieve, but never did. And there's something about... about you that I can't &quot;Brother, you and me, and me here in my, uh, rip-off Oakleys spelled with, like, two Es, in my pick-up truck - that's never held any lumber...&quot; &quot;My fake Oakleys looking and it's reflecting into my glasses, just a iPhone so old you didn't know they And I'm here to tell you that your insight about how Black people but, I don't know, it's because of, uh, - tattoos or something...&quot; and I don't either, &quot;And actually, also, he's just... It's almost like parody, 'cause he's a capital-G grifter, like classic, does not not even is exaggerating belief... middling career in music, until he starts... he takes his, um... He's a manlet, by the way, which is fine. It doesn't matter. But he - who cares, you know? Short pauper, not king. - He does not - He's a short jester. There is no... relationship between the brand and the ideas that he's putting forward, because to play to this that he can always tout as &quot;The number-one song selling on iTunes - and it's 'cause 60 people use iTunes and every single one of them - - &quot;Rich Men North of Richmond&quot; song. But he is - he is tatted up. Including a... &quot;HOG,&quot; I believe, is on his chin, which stands over &quot;Hang Over Gang.&quot; He's now sober, by the way. He got that at the time were edgy-crazy-fun-time. But his whole thing is like... &quot;I'm not a thug like these Black guys, but also I've got tattoos on my thighs!&quot; - (Jarvis laughing) Yeah, there it is. &quot;HOG.&quot; I remember not knowing what that said. I remember, I said, &quot;Does it say 'HOB'?&quot; (both laughing) - Um... Dude, we're hobgobs. Shoutout to RuneScape. - Um... OH MY GOD, look at his...! Oh, &quot;Politically correct&quot; - It's nega-politically correct. [JORDAN] Dude, he is [JARVIS] Um, OK. Also, before we get into this, - the Southern guy, uh, this weekend and it was like the Shadow Ho-Oh weekend. And I got to Santa Monica and I was sitting on a park bench. And a man came up to me, and it was a older white dude. Uh, and he goes... &quot;You know, I got a question for you, And I was like, &quot;Huh?&quot; And he... I look at his phone, and it's got Pokemon GO on it. - That's awesome. - Ahh, that's so sick! this was actually so I walked with this dude for a block and explained some stuff about the event. He was like, &quot;My family so I just came out here - Whoa! - That's fun. Taking a little trip to... - to the beach, baby. It was so sweet, so shoutout to that guy. Never got his name. Maybe he's in this video. Um, he would never. He... - Too honorable. I mean, we should say... Tom MacDonald's greatest crime, Everyone's a fucking grifter - in this political sphere, right? His greatest crime is how He's so - I mean, that's always been my obsession with him, - is just he's very corny. He takes himself so seriously; presents himself with, like, this... I mean, even this photo is so funny. With an incredibly clean Uh, so, number-one corny rapper. Finally has developed - by introducing - my favorite other munchkin of the internet. - Uh... Hates rap music. Thinks that it is, and also would say, you know, anybody that presents themself, you know, a little thug maybe... maybe has some of the thug elements of Tom MacDonald is a dangerous thing. The way they've airbrushed It looks like The Last of Us. Dude! It looks like a fan-made poster for a movie - where there's no trailer yet. The, uh... also, doesn't Ben Shapiro have that famous, uh, quote where he's like, - then you're wrong&quot;? - That's fact, you see. But Tom MacDonald x Ben Shapiro, Hunter x Hunter, - uh, let's pull up the - that Tom MacDonald has - which is, um... which is rare for these spaces. Yeah. Not inflated - or explicitly paid for. Yeah. I think oftentimes people but I... Genuinely, his stuff gets Look, man, I think there is a - I think there's a tendency for... you know, discourse-y stuff online to maybe lose itself the quality of something. Like, &quot;The Daily Wire movie sucked. Like, they're poorly made - aren't talented and they're stupid. And nobody with talent or or willingness to work hard so wouldn't bring their talents to it. But... Tom MacDonald, not a particularly talented technical lyricist, But he is, like, you know... serving a pretty generic package. Like, what he's putting out - It's not, like, weird alt shit. But it gets to mask itself - [JARVIS] Right. There's nothing wrong with feeling like there's something off about life. There is. (stammering) Americans are being - the world, but Americans in this - are being screwed over. But it's not by people saying, - &quot;Please stop shooting teenagers.&quot; &quot;This is bad, actually.&quot; Or, like, hey, maybe don't get mad at a... &quot;Please stop asking my child Like, &quot;Stop asking Uh, also, and I'm sorry Can you hit 'escape,' Jacob? Scroll a little bit down on the sidebar, first video on the sidebar. &quot;Dear Slim (produced by Eminem)&quot;? No, it fucking wasn't. Unless he just took the &quot;Stan&quot;... Wait, actually, can you click on it? What's the beat? He might've just bought an Eminem beat. 'Cause you can do that. Dear Slim, I thought you 'cause lately everywhere I turn - I never would've thought - - Oh, &quot;Beat produced by Marshall Mathers.&quot; It's crazy how much - of his material now - - over and over? - Not saying it. It is like - I feel like it would be in the same song where Where it's like, you could not argue Like... &quot;Dear Slim, you've 'cause people compare us.&quot; - What UNIVERSE do you live on?! 'Cause you are white, I guess. That is it. &quot;Tom bought it himself with a bid of $100,000 from an auction.&quot; - That is so sad. Like, I have no problem with people That's just how the business works. But... he literally, like... You know he bought it about idolizing Eminem. That honestly bums me out. That legitimately makes me feel bad. Uh, can you go to 'Cause I just wanna read we get claimed for the song. First of all, he's a genius, Oh, dude, I have the Genius - for the new track, and every single Ben Shapiro line has been annotated by someone being like, &quot;Here's what this is.&quot; - I'm an adult. Thanks. &quot;Dear Slim, I thought you 'cause lately everywhere I turn (laughs) Come on, dude. It's funny how I already knew his flow. - OK. &quot;Comparing us, crazy. I never thought... I never would've thought that I would buy bleach in a box Oh, 'cause he bleach-blonded his hair? - But he never would've thought that. &quot;Hi, my name is Tom MacDonald. People call me controversial. I'm the one that counterculture follows.&quot; - That is false. That is absolutely - It's very much monoculture Brother, who is more counterculture than mainstream Canada? - That's pretty fucking counterculture. It's funny how they've, uh... - Oh, yeah. They're like, &quot;Oh, He is - it's self-conscious, in a way. It's like, uh... 30 Rock, really, really 'cause they're competent enough Lil Wayne does a lot of internal rhymes because he's talented enough If it's just, like... This feels more like someone that, uh, when they tell a joke... You know stand-ups that'll go, like, &quot;And that's when my wife said 'hi,' uhhh;&quot; they do that 'cause they're self-conscious It's like, &quot;I haven't done anything... substantial yet. I'll just... do more of it. I can't take any pauses. I'm saying words!&quot; &quot;I offend an awful lot with topics, commenting on race and politics. - I'm pretty awesome.&quot; OK, this is great. The next lyric is, &quot;Dear Slim, Seems like some of your biggest fans are the victims I'm triggering.&quot; - OK. - But, uh... - but some of them. which ain't consistent with history. I was picked on as a kid, and they don't know what Slim did for me. But I'm here now, and I fight this system just like you.&quot; OK, I don't think you're Can you imagine if, uh... Shady had dropped a track in, like, Encore era that was just like... Instead of being like, &quot;Hey, and become a part of the and prove myself to the... the masters of the gate, to the OGs,&quot; instead he was just like, &quot;Stop being It's actually good!&quot; I mean, he does kind of - OK. There's a few lines - I think more tastefully done. - Yeah, they're clever. I mean, just like how he's referencing saying he says some stuff, but isn't saying it in this song, he's just referencing, like, &quot;Yeah, some of the victims, - whoever, nothing specific.&quot; but Marshall, that can't be right, dude. You'd have to hate yourself as well, Oh, he - Sorry; I just realized. Yeah. Uh... (laughs) Three of that last four lines (laughing) That's trash. Actually, two of them are &quot;just like you.&quot; But I think that's fine, but I just don't think It's not, like... Look, yeah, there's no But this is... There's no fucking punch. There's no reason that this is a, uh - There's no, like, - He's just saying the thing again. the internal rhyme would be insane And they would also, you know, mean multiple things. &quot;Marshall, remember back when You changed the world with a pen. - Well, now I'm just like you&quot;?! This should be called &quot;Dear Dad.&quot; - &quot;Come back! People say you hate me.&quot; - Um... - I'm your son.&quot; &quot;I don't give... I don't give a what, saying what I...&quot; OK, please tell me, god, that's the F-word, that that's &quot;fuck.&quot; This is, uh, like every hook he does. &quot;I don't give a what, na-na-na-na&quot;? It's always some, like, shitty royalty-free style, like, &quot;Na-na-na&quot; backing. &quot;Everybody triggered Why do they say that so much, dude? - He doesn't really swear, too, which is... I mean, he has, but there is this weird - You can see it That's - what a fascinating... &quot;Dear Slim, I thought that maybe He didn't for you! &quot;You might relate to weight - UGH! &quot;They're constantly comparing us to you; - &quot;'Cause we suck!&quot; has a better song about Well, I mean, &quot;People are being&quot; - how people are being mean. &quot;Everyone's bullying me. They're definitely bullying me, 'cause I'm triggering them. - They actually like that.&quot; &quot;Call me culture-vulture garbage; I kill a vulture, cook the poultry in a pan - 'til it's burned.&quot; - This doesn't go anywhere, though. It's just - it's like wordplay like, any meaning. &quot;See&quot; - &quot;See, Marshall? I'm just like you. - I'm flippin' the bird.&quot; And what is...? But what's the vulture here, again? Yeah. Notice that - Yeah, actually. - The only thing I could - - That's the only thing. &quot;I'm flippin' the bird.&quot; I feel like this has to be a reference to &quot;The Uh... But, like... &quot;Dear Slim, I just wanna I spent hours memorizing &quot;You were the reason I screamed - This is actually embarrassing. Holy shit. Do you think that's like a... Wait. Do you think that's a typo? Does he really say Maybe &quot;as a teen&quot;? &quot;You were the reason I screamed Yeah, that would line up with his, like... With his fucking, uh, This is embarrassing, though. &quot;I'm here now. They call me We're both white, both rap, - both our eyes blue.&quot; - It's like a love letter. - I feel like this shouldn't be public. - This is way more intimate than &quot;Stan.&quot; This is actually - what's crazy is... Eminem wrote &quot;Stan&quot; about people like this, and he missed it. He missed the point. Yeah. Even the music video, Wait, there is an annotation! &quot;In a Crypt YouTube reaction, - he breaks this line down.&quot; &quot;'Vulture, cook the poultry. The poultry is chicken or birds, - He's flipping [it] in the pan.'&quot; Look! Nice. &quot;He's flipping the rhyme scheme.&quot; OK. He's - he's saying, &quot;Hey... Hey, screw you! I'm not a culture vulture, actually.&quot; - It's so funny. I don't think - - That's not the thing. Dude, you don't have any culture, Tom. - You're Canadian. &quot;I dropped 100 grand Oof. Don't admit it. &quot;Whether you love or hate me, Dropped 100 grand to get a beat from Shady. I really hope when - (laughs) - that he changed me!&quot; &quot;The truth of the matter is All right. This is... - This is too &quot;Stan.&quot; It's - the whole song It's in the car, just writing the, like - There's just never a situation where the right response to people is to go, like, &quot;Uh, you're getting mad at me.&quot; This is Matt Rife It's so funny, 'cause uh, for valid reasons. But then, also, it was at a time when that wasn't like a cultural thing, where there wasn't cancel culture. People were actually picketing Eminem. - Eminem shows and stuff. it's different. When you are - a Elvis cover act, you don't get to - People don't come to you and go, - &quot;Hey, you stole rock 'n' roll.&quot; [JORDAN] &quot;I'm just like you, dude. &quot;They say I'm not nothin' but a hound dog!&quot; - &quot;I'm just like you, you see?&quot; &quot;Here's another letter, please.&quot; Cool guy, though. Neat. But new track does feature Benny Schwa. Oh, man. Now I just keep thinking &quot;Stan,&quot; the song, and how much rhyming - wasn't in that song. That was - I mean, you can tell with that it kind of basically just was the letter. You know? There wasn't really - You could just break it up, take away the rhythm a little bit, You're just saying the thing - No metaphor, allegory, no nothing. 'Cause it's too, like, hard. Literally, I just thought of where he's like, &quot;I'm really honored and here's an autograph for your brother. It's like there's so much - internal rhyme in that. - Uh, but then - - Like, it says a lot. It's dense. Uh, but then he's like, the only wordplay I saw was the &quot;flippin' the bird&quot; thing, - and it wasn't even - like, come on. I mean, that would be like, if instead, he was just like, &quot;Hey, yeah, &quot;And I can't wait for you &quot;And I can't wait for you to get my letter. I've got my middle finger up, remember?&quot; - &quot;You don't like stuff!&quot; you dare me to drive?&quot; &quot;Do you like, um... uh, the... - We're white, right?&quot; Asking for white rapper solidarity Oh, this rocks. But the only... He really might be the only person At least Ben Shapiro - A lot of the time. &quot;I actually think those were bars.&quot; &quot;I just think he's wrong, but I do - believe he believes what he believes.&quot; &quot;I don't know if I can listen to that.&quot; OK, so this music video, It's Tom MacDonald, featuring Ben Shapiro. Tom MacDonald is wearing a sweatshirt - that says &quot;I don't care if I offend you.&quot; - Is that true? Well, no, hold on. Hopefully, I don't get offended. The one thing that Then maybe he could've apologized, helped me through this. It still doesn't clarify what it is - that he does to offend me. feel like they should be - with big fat truck-nuts under it. (laughs) &quot;I don't care if I offend you.&quot; &quot;Honk if my driving sucks. &quot;Baby on board. My baby's a gun. &quot;And I'm bored of this shit, - so I'll kill you, I guess.&quot; - It's a tailgate and you have to really... - &quot;'Mission Valley Senior High.' OK.&quot; - Go ahead; hit us with this. It's the D.A.R.E. logo. - Oh, very cool. Badass. - &quot;FACTS don't care about your feelings.&quot; Also, by the way, &quot;Hang Over Gang.&quot; - Very cool. - Oh, not at all. Oh, he's doing like Day for Night. - Oh my god, this is crazy. two separate stages. - They didn't even meet for this. This looks like an Amazon photoshoot. Where it's like, &quot;OK, we need to change - what the shirt says for the merch.&quot; the graphic onto the T-shirt.&quot; These are two different models - on two different days. - OK. So, how did you wanna do this? Uh, hilarious that they are... It's the only time I've ever seen an image where these two guys aren't way shorter than - It is weird seeing - Yeah, it's like The Hobbit. (both laughing) Um, so we can just watch through, I thought what we could do is, uh... I will read you, like, the first - I tried doing it with but it was always too obvious So instead, when we get to the Ben part, which we can even probably 'cause the Tom shit is all the same, instead I thought I'd give you, like... a line or two and see if Mmhmm. &quot;Keep hating on me on the internet. My comment section all woke Karens.&quot; &quot;Keep hating on me on the internet. My comment section all woke Karens.&quot; Making all the... - Benjamins... and you all will just keep starin'. It would make so much more sense. It's - you got the, like, the theme exactly right. The &quot;Benjamins&quot; element At no point does he use that pun, Uh, no, it's... Actually, let's just go ahead - and play it. Keep hating on me on the internet And I make racks off compound interest (Jordan wheezing) He's back to his graphs - &quot;I make racks off&quot; - - with &quot;compound interest&quot;? The rhyme being &quot;int&quot;? - (laughing) That is the overlap? What's a rhyme? It's some of the same letters. 'Cause he didn't even like &quot;in-ter-est,&quot; which would've closer rhymed to &quot;internet.&quot; - &quot;In-ter-est.&quot; Wait, it was written for him, - so he doesn't know how to rap it. So he's... &quot;I make&quot; - wait. &quot;Compound in-ter-est.&quot; - &quot;Int'rest.&quot; You live with your parents. It's so scary, - Sorry; that's - went to Eminem lines. - No. - [JACOB] Look how happy Tom looks. He's so excited to be in the same room. So, yeah, I do think thematically, though, I did hit roughly what he was going for. Yeah, he's just doing the same tit-for-tat, but his tit-for-tat again is like, What's the next...? Like, let's - ...off compound interest; Nicki, take some notes, - &quot;Nicki, take some notes&quot;? &quot;Nicki, take some notes, Something about &quot;number one.&quot; &quot;Did this for fun, one, done.&quot; Uh, &quot;Nicki, take some notes, I'm gonna hang up the mic and when it's over, it's done.&quot; &quot;Nicki, take some notes...&quot; &quot;Nicki, take some notes, I make a better song than you Play it. ...this for fun All my people, download this, &quot;All my people download this&quot; - (laughing) Dude! It's like an acrostic poem that, like, a five-year-old writes. [BOTH] &quot;All my people download this, get a Billboard number one.&quot; - That's going right on the fridge, man. are not working for you. You could've reduced the syllables and made it a bit easier - &quot;All my people, download this.&quot; - It's like he's quantized. - They removed all the swing. They had to edit him onto the beat, Dude, pulling that swing slider to zero. - [JARVIS] Yeah. &quot;I want you to yell, Ben.&quot; I'm glad he was able to, um - I mean, he crushed it. Nobody... still no one's touched on - that we're offended by. I mean, other than just random - They just kind of shotgun-approach a bunch of things - that no one actually cares about. and going to jail. Yeah, not to mention strippers. - I think there was maybe - I think there was a miscalculation, You know when you hear a feature on a track that so clearly has a really like the track is like, &quot;Here's my...&quot; uh, &quot;a major trauma in my childhood. I was in the military. That's why I dropped out. I was in jail. And then they get a feature on it that clearly tags on way late to give the single a boost, and then 21 comes on and he's just like, &quot;I'm making money, I'm having a nice day,&quot; and it's like, &quot;OK, you defaulted because there wasn't planning.&quot; &quot;Uh, we're doing a song about 'offensive'? &quot;Playing the hits? Um, Black people steal. They go to jail. Um, they buy cars and strippers.&quot; I'm still thinking about that and I'm trying to see if literally &quot;Nicki, take some notes, I just do this for fun.&quot; &quot;All my people, download this, - None of... doing music for fun. - She's too serious about it. &quot;Do this for fun.&quot; &quot;Num-ber one.&quot; &quot;Fun. One.&quot; &quot;Download this, do this...&quot; - &quot;This, this.&quot; &quot;Download this.&quot; - It's really... It's just like - I'm just looking for more rhymes than just, &quot;syllable-syllable-syllable-syllable, technically rhymes.&quot; It's like a poem. Yeah. I mean, it's just... It's, uh... What it is is like bad... It's instinct writing, where to tie it in in some way. So, like, the reason isn't because there's some kind of or maybe he's alluding to something - he forgot to check the last line. Could've changed anything. uh, &quot;all my people download&quot; - - That's so much. Where does this song go from here? - Uh, back to the killer hook. There's a lot, yeah, left, - considering Ben's done. It's crazy that he's done. - He didn't do that much at all. He's gotta go sleep in a shoebox. We ain't sellin' drugs, We ain't pushing guns This is why it's popular with 65-year-olds, because the people it's popular with &quot;Rap music is about - strippers and cars.&quot; And it's not about, like, um... you know, it's not an expression of someone's material conditions, It's an expression of wanting Black people have that that makes them do hip-hop, or whatever. And so bragging about - is so nothing, right? I... I know it's self-aware in the sense that they don't have any principles so they do kind of know Play this last line again, Jacob? - And just think about the visuals, right? - Why - OK. - [JACOB] Yeah. And he's saying, &quot;But I wouldn't go to...&quot; - &quot;I'm not gonna overdose.&quot; with blue and red.&quot; - He's in cosplay. so together it's the American flag.&quot; &quot;Blue lives matter. How 'bout that?&quot; &quot;What happened to flags?&quot; &quot;Remember the flags that we had, - &quot;What happened to maple leaves?&quot; This ain't rap; this ain't We ain't sellin' drugs; &quot;This ain't rap; this ain't Instead, it's... - a rap about what we rap about, - which is not what we like. - We don't like rap music. We're making rap music about how we Also, I did spend $100,000 - because he inspired me and I love him. Did I offend you? With all of the - Which I don't like, also. - I... - Maybe true. Incredibly sad fact. I mean, he shoots all these videos at home. Literally, he does. And it is a... There's... something a little bit sad to me. It's like when a comic gets, and then instead of own up or at least counter it or something, - become that guy, right? - Right. It's like, man, Tom, I know you don't want to Like, you would rather be just making the kinda stuff where You're existing in a world where you are more corny and less admirable and less admired than MGK. - By a huge margin. - &quot;Rap Devil&quot; is less corny than this. Tom MacDonald doesn't Dude, number one on iTunes, dude. Over 300 purchases. - (laughing) and it gets bought by someone, I watched a video of him, um, employing his family to package up his CDs. - And - they do sales physically. And I'm like, has it occurred to you... - (laughing) Sorry. That if you can... If you can... manage the inventory yourself - you're not selling that many CDs? And also, if you have an audience that's - I mean, that's a... - I'll just stop it there. CDs are over. iTunes is in. - Mm, I see. I hear something about - that I'm pretty psyched to try. It's gonna make my Oh, dude. It just sucks. I mean, it's like if, uh... It's like if we were moderate- to right-leaning conservatives, but we have to say the stuff &quot;But our audience is mostly leftist. I guess we'll just kind of...&quot; It's like, &quot;It's fine. It's a job. It's like, he can get away but there's gotta be that You know, nobody gets into music... with, like... Plenty of people do it cynically, like, but it's not an easy craft - unless you do have some dream. of an old stand-up comedian putting out - a Netflix special called &quot;Canceled.&quot; - &quot;Problem?&quot; - &quot;Oh,&quot; just a condescending guy. uh, 'cause I heard - &quot;Sorry, Not Sorry.&quot; - &quot;I'm gonna get canceled for this.&quot; super, super-high-detail photos of them. - Yeah. - [JARVIS] Yeah. - Like, humping the... humping the stool. &quot;What can I say now? There's two genders, You fucking freak. (laughing) What a weirdo. OK, is this I don't wanna be offended. I'll admit it, dude: I - Benny gets so much... love from me unconditionally - It really is - I'm a strong proponent could've easily swept up If he put away all of that when he gets up for the primary debate, &quot;Uwu.&quot; Or someone says to Vivek, like, &quot;Hey, I don't like - you, like, - if he went, &quot;Aw, c'mon.&quot; - [JORDAN] &quot;Hey, stop it.&quot; &quot;Why are you mad at me?&quot; - Nice. that Vivek Ramaswamy is from Kenya. Noooo-uhhh. &quot;Where's your birth certificate to Kenya?&quot; - Dude, this has 500,000 likes. - And 10 million views. - Nice. is to point to that, &quot;Um, yeah, you don't like it? We're not mainstream. [JACOB] I've watched it probably 5 times - because it's so fucking funny. I mean, you know that old video, that super early viral video falling over, and going, It's like if we made fun of that, and then she was like, &quot;Oh, jealous?!&quot; - (all laughing) - &quot;I can fall over like the best of 'em.&quot; - Um... with a football, like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; - &quot;Get on my level.&quot; Have fun, I guess. Good job, guys. - Dude, he looks adorable. That's fun, dude. Oh... a bit of a... announcement. A bit of a follow-up on an announcement. We... - talked about Sad Boyz wiki in the past. And we asked, and - but they've delivered a little too much. Because there are like two Sad Boyz wikis on Fandom.com, or something. And then I found - Er, everybody started complaining and we should use So we started working on that, so now there's three wikis. And so I just wanted to say that the official wiki for is... We're pulling up the link. The official wiki is SadBoyzWiki... miraheze? .org. Uh, we're gonna put that behind a more convenient URL. But... if you've worked on any pages feel free to port them over here. Jacob, could you check, uh... Just click on mine - I wanna see if there's a vital &quot;Career goals: Jordan has stated is to be killed in a duel.&quot; Great. &quot;And that it would be 'so sick.'&quot; - That would be, actually, the best. [JACOB] And they have [PAST JORDAN] I think my goal for my career - Whoa! They're right! (laughing) If I try to deny it. Wow. It's 11:55 a.m., right before high noon. I'm like, &quot;I never said that, actually!&quot; - &quot;Good luck proving it.&quot; - after killing you. - But I am in the court still. - Flies buzzing around me. It's been weeks. &quot;May my client approach the bench?&quot; - They just drag my corpse. So, our wiki is available at wiki.sadboyzpod.com. And feel free to contribute. Feel free to port over any of the and none of them are official anymore, - except for this one. Except for this one. Whichever one says the most - Mmmm... We do need people to moderate the duel - I feel like we're gonna get Do not add anything else - to the career goals section. Just the duel. - [ANASTASIA] How are you so duel-pilled? Can you just...? I think what makes me... laugh about it so much is that you'd have to And I'm not killed; I'm wounded. Like, so I'm on the show. I still have gunpowder residue - from my flintlock. - I'm tired, dude. Same day! I appreciate your You get shot in a duel; Well, a lot of the time we record around so I'm gonna push that a little earlier, I do like the idea that you're trying to Yeah. I mean, that would be &quot;How's your 4:00?&quot; &quot;Ooh. Ooh.&quot; - &quot;I've got a late lunch.&quot; - Thur - ...Wednesday...&quot; &quot;Anything that ends with -day, &quot;Weekday, weekend, morning, night, - evening, afternoon. Definitely not.&quot; - &quot;Bang!&quot; They're just shooting me. &quot;Ow!' I guess that's cheating. It's funny - Mmhmm. &quot;Hey!&quot; Our last little segment, as we like to call it, our little - I almost said &quot;seggy,&quot; - which, that doesn't... - That's not gonna be what we call it. - (Jarvis laughing) - No. Ohhh, I heard about it, though. - &quot;Leggy.&quot; Fuck is that? It's one of the - I saw memes about it. They were like, Other days, it's 'leggy.'&quot; It literally felt - My Wordle score, I usually get it, - [JACOB] Yeah. terrible at Wordle. after two vowels are gone, I'm like, That's most of them, I feel like. &quot;There's an E in everything!&quot; I feel like - the thing that is that there's an objective meta, What's the word that has And you can start there [ANASTASIA] My starter word is &quot;audio.&quot; Oh, &quot;audio,&quot; actually, that - Mine's &quot;leggy.&quot; - Which finally worked out. Still didn't get it - Spelled it different. &quot;Ledgy.&quot; - &quot;Hmm. Leggy...&quot; - &quot;Beggy.&quot; - Leggo. - or a guy with really big legs. - that's saying &quot;let's go.&quot; - &quot;Hey, leggo.&quot; &quot;Let go me Eggo!&quot; So, uh... Deepfakes. Uh, Celebrity AI deepfake scams - There are a lot of them. - (laughing) Sorry. First of all, I wanna say that that are just horrible. Like, for example, um... Uh, non-consensually turning someone into, uh, - a pornographic situation is extremely gross and horrible. This happened to Taylor Swift recently, but it's also happened to and has been happening for a while. So, uh, I understand that people - The White House just commented and people were like, the biggest celebrity in the But, uh... - At least it's getting some kind of... At least the response is not, Yeah. It definitely, I think, should be... It's essentially like Because you're... taking something that was not... Basically, it's like the - to these materials being made of them. There's no argument to be made on the part of the people Every single time it's people being like, I would be complimented.&quot; what you would like, actually, 'cause it's not you in the photo. In fact, you can't do anything - 'cause it's me, so don't do that. - Um, and so - So, that's on, like, the most evil, deplorable, sick, uh... side of things. Um... On the maybe just evil and goofy side is celebrity AI scams, which are becoming worse and worse - Better and better, which is - More convincing; worse ethically. the easier it is for, um, Drake to talk about how you've got a... Uh... He's got a bunch of iPhones and you've gotta - Oh, wait, fuck, that's a real scam. Drake's got too much popcorn, and he wants to give it to you, so you can sign up for Drake's popcorn. DaBaby just sent me an e-mail, - will get a Ferrari. Tom Cruise just said, pheromone cologne from my TikTok shop, uh, gets to be in the next [JORDAN] He gets to be the mission. He gets to be the mission. &quot;Your mission, should you &quot;You gotta sign up for this timeshare.&quot; Uh, so we're gonna look at some of those celebrity AI scams that are currently in circulation. We're gonna see if people We're gonna buy them. - We're gonna buy each product. Well, business expense. Well, let's see. Let's see if we'll... Let's have an argument about it. Let's have a good old-fashioned Well, I have evidence, though. - There's videos. Let's start with the earliest one which was the MrBeast scam. The reason I laughed when this Anytime a - a really low-res photo - is just very funny. It's like, &quot;Whoa!&quot; So, it looks like MrBeast, uh, 'cause it says &quot;MrBeast&quot; But that's actually - and they have a different account name. Um, so depending on how you watch it, but I'm sure it tricked somebody. [AI JIMMY] If you're watching this video, who will get an iPhone 15 Pro for just $2. I'm MrBeast, and I'm doing Click the link below to claim yours now. Wow, that is a really, really bad There are a few phrases But when he said He sounds sad. - Yeah. The thing is it seems MrBeast's normal talking voice, You're used to it being like, and I'm gonna put I've seen a handful of MrBeast videos. they open like that, and he doesn't Yeah, he doesn't go, &quot;I'm MrBeast.&quot; Yeah, MrBeast wouldn't &quot;I'm MrBeast, and I'm going to do - what I said I was doing.&quot; and today I'm giving away... Why would MrBeast charge money for them? - [JARVIS] At all? &quot;For $2, you can have an iPhone.&quot; (as Trump) &quot;You can have That feels like - using Trump feels so much more effective - would fall for that. Plus, sure, there's but it's kids. Do they have...? It's harder for a kid to get - than it is for an adult with a card. some sort of - maybe or maybe it's on the or maybe it's the community that does this. But I need some sort of Because there's places where Or &quot;have to report it,&quot; right? Like, if it's undetectable, Yeah, the consequences just being - but also they don't check. How do you prove that With the way that the story correcting the original story is not usually gonna get as much reach as the original story, so... I'm sure that there's gonna be that are wrong, that kind of - go below the radar. - Um... Once there is some kinda regulation, where do you draw the line, right? - [JARVIS] Yeah. &quot;I post-processed my audio using AI, and it did make me sound Yeah, 'cause then, also, and then you change like one word. - Um... adjust to the impact. But also, the platform has to be I mean, China's more proactive about AI regulation in general, so that could be a reason that Meta doesn't really have an incentive - to make Instagram less predatory with AI. I think that the leadership some sort of existential threat, But it needs to move fast. Though, on the optimistic side, the... consumer, the average consumer, much like when I was aunt would Google search and and I'd be like, &quot;No, that's an ad,&quot; - And it's like, &quot;You just kinda know.&quot; - [JORDAN] The flavor. - Um... - the shiniest link. who are coming up now Like, or at least... I don't think - hmm, what am I saying? I do think that people to these sorts of things, 'cause obviously the thing about this is this is the worst that it's ever gonna be. Is how it is right now, And it's already improved so quickly. So one could imagine or near perfect at some point, And the mission is also, you know - I don't know about all of these, but usually the mission with these setups is not, &quot;Well, maybe we can trick a couple hundred people into paying us the $10 for the iPhone,&quot; Maybe somebody will send to send your credit card information. It's not about the $10. Or even just your address. Just data. - Just information. paint with a wide... paint with a, um, a wide net. &quot;Paint with a wide net&quot;? - Paint a big net. - Big brush, wide net. Cast a wide net, and, um... There are gonna be And those already exist, with deepfaking the voices of loved ones and then claiming to have &quot;Hi, sweetie. I have Yeah, but those are already - Not the iPhone ones, &quot;Hey, we've got someone you love. You need to send money Um, and then maybe doing some social engineering do a SIM swap thing or whatever where it looks like it's coming from and then they can't contact them - This is why I don't have any loved ones. - And I chose that. Do you... Do you love me? That would actually mean My mic must be off. Oh, dude, r/scams is gonna be having - a bumper couple of years. that, uh, shows up in your default feed. - Oh, really? - Or maybe I get recommended it. And maybe it's r/scams, I think it's r/scams, - &quot;Hey, is this a scam?&quot; And a lot of the time it's like, &quot;OK, yeah,&quot; 'cause people &quot;What's the catch,&quot; right? Often, it's like there's no - If it seems too good to be true, All right, what's Whoever this is. Venmo thing all over TikTok? [AI SHAQ] Look at this. - and got put into his account same day. [AI SHAQ] This could really Oh, wait. That is not what Shaq sounds like. - It's also not what his hands look like. - It is - And plus, dude... Look, I don't know the specifics. We can check networth.com or whatever. I'm pretty sure Shaq has - if he uses it at all. Look at that. It's just got and then it's a different website with It's not even the Venmo app. - Yeah, it's in like Safari. 'cause then that would be So they've gotta make Benmo or whatever. And it's gotta be Ben Shapiro's for the not-woke. What is he...? Is he advertising Venmo? Like, is Shaq in the...? Yeah, can we back up? I totally forgot [AI SHAQ] Venmo thing all over TikTok? - &quot;Venmo thing.&quot; into his account same day. This could really benefit If you strugglin', give it a try, man. [AI SHAQ] Have you seen - - Is Shaq's son short on cash? - [JACOB] It'll give you $750 for free. But then the ad that it's advertising - is &quot;my favorite planner&quot;? Excuse me? &quot;My Heal... - My Healthy Planner.&quot; - What the hell? What the health? What the frick? I feel like someone could do - &quot;My son.&quot; I can't do it. - &quot;It's me, Cr1TiKaL.&quot; &quot;I found this new app. [ANASTASIA] They need unique voice. [ANASTASIA] Shaq has one of the most Because it's unique, but it's filled in with regular voice, with a little bit of a Shaq tone. But that won't always be the case. Also, I mean, at this point All right, let's see this. There is - this is Jennifer Aniston. There is so much audio - of Jennifer Aniston - speaking with charisma, presentation. - Or can you? [AI ANISTON] If you're watching this video, who will get MacBook Pro for just $10. Jennifer Aniston here - - (laughing) She did the MrBeast thing. - What's going on? It's, uh... you know what's funny? Is they... It feels like it's trained on - Like, why is she projecting so much? &quot;If YOU'RE watching this, who's gonna get A MACBOOK I'M JENNIFER ANISTON. I'M SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.&quot; [ANASTASIA] The MrBeast one - Yeah! We've gotta mix these. - Why can't they just...? - &quot;What's goin' on?!&quot; &quot;I was in Friends.&quot; &quot;We were on a break!&quot; - The other guy says that. - (tiny Wookiee noise) - I'm gonna glomp you folks. To get $9 off. - Okurrr. [AI ANISTON] ...and I'm doing Just go to my site below (Jordan laughing) What - is that the web - ?! - Why is it doing that? - (laughing) What the fuck is that? of, uh, those chain e-mails, &quot;Bill Gates decided to give - &quot;You're one of the lucky 10,000 people.&quot; how he wants you to know. Yeah! &quot;Hey, guys! It's Bill Gates!&quot; - &quot;It's me!&quot; &quot;What's goin' on? I'm Microsoft.&quot; - (laughing) Yeah. - &quot;The name's Steve Jobs from Microsoft.&quot; - Why is - - &quot;From Nigeria.&quot; Oh, dude, if they did this exact video but they trained it on a Nigerian prince? (Nigerian accent) &quot;Hello. I'm here to tell you about my MacBook.&quot; OK. All right. What do I do? - How do I sign up? &quot;Rachel, we were on a break.&quot; &quot;We were not dating!&quot; - &quot;But I love you.&quot; &quot;Welcome to a vid - - (Jacob laughing) - &quot;Let's find out!&quot; - I need to know, dude! - That's wild. Why would... I know it - There's always a weird dilemma, right, you think, &quot;Well, like...&quot; &quot;But can't they do a better job scamming?&quot; But ones doing a good job, - we don't notice. are not the people scamming. - 'Cause right now it's not so accessible that, like, anybody even has the resources to generate their own stuff 'Cause you do need some computing resources I... I think we're probably The one I really hate, I think of these, is the Shaq one, - 'cause that's so predatory. 'Cause the rest of these not that privilege is only the new iPhone, laptop... cool. Understand why they're desirable. You're, for the most part, preying on, You want a slice of cake?&quot; he even references, &quot;This could help a lot of people.&quot; But, I mean, even the iPhone those are things you could sell So it's like you want a free thing. as they get more advanced, &quot;Oh, hey, now we're doing, um...&quot; You know, &quot;If you want an advance And then you start but it's also a scam. No, that's a really good - I guess I hadn't 'Cause this is kind of like of an obviously fake product Like, it's just, uh... - too much sauce, too much spice. - It's like if I was the scammer, I would do a better job, 'cause I know But I think if we took, uh - If we reduced the amount of visuals, right? Maybe take MrBeast, 'cause say We're trying to shoot Get a quick clip of Jimmy. Maybe don't do it so close-up. Um, then - and also don't Also, it doesn't need to be It could be shot like a commercial. from existing commercials so that interstitched with fake Jennifer Aniston, You have less time to detect. I'm sure there's B-roll you can just get of other sponsorships they've done, a Jennifer Aniston ad with a clip of her looking at It feels like this was generated using, And they're like, &quot;Show us 30 seconds And she's like, &quot;HEY, GUYS. - WELCOME TO ANISTON-CON.&quot; - [JARVIS] Yeah. &quot;I'M GONNA PUT A BUS IN A HOLE!&quot; - (laughing) - (Nigerian accent) &quot;Hello, everyone.&quot; &quot;Could I be any more This is, uh, Chandler, - MrBeast, Nigerian, uh, putting a bus in a hole. - I'm in. 100% retention. - &quot;How you doing?&quot; I'm watching my favorite part. - &quot;Hot point,&quot; or whatever. &quot;Jarvis backed this up 100 times.&quot; (Nigerian accent) &quot;What is going - &quot;How are you doing?&quot; - Mmhmm. &quot;How are you doing?&quot; You try to have a conversation with him. That would be a &quot;Hey, guys, it's me.&quot; &quot;I'm the&quot; - wait. &quot;Hey, guys, - &quot;Hey, what's goin' on, guys?&quot; It's me, The Rock. I'm over here - He already makes videos like that! You don't even need to do &quot;What's goin' on? Going to - &quot;Gotta say, wow.&quot; Oh, you know what? And the Joe Rogan one - 'cause he does talk about those products. - Yeah. if you did, like you're saying, hid a little more of the seams, but then you made the... If it is for an actual and they very, like, subtly disclose, in accordance with whatever &quot;#parody&quot; or something, like it's a joke, like, &quot;Of course Trump But anyway, we're a cars-for-gold service. You can trade in all of your hubcaps, - You can trade that in for a payday loan.&quot; where people will - people with shitty dropship things will do a little Mr - &quot;Mr.&quot; MrMKBHD. Um... &quot;I'm MKBHD!&quot; - &quot;I'm Marques.&quot; &quot;I'm gonna see how many (laughs) &quot;You're one of the So, um... (laughing) So, I think that those But the thing is, like, - is probably not gonna fall for this. But then there are Scammers are everywhere. People are hurting. scamming their fellow person. And that's always gonna be a thing. But... We need to equip the, um... We need to equip our most vulnerable with the knowledge and... sort of skill set to identify these things. You know, like Kitboga, - the guy who does the scam stuff. Some of the - it's so interesting hearing the scripts that the scammers use. And they're ready to, like, rob an older lady of... - you know, all of her retirement money. And it's like... I mean, I get that there's inequality, but this person wasn't doing anything bad, and they're like... it just feels wrong. Scamming someone It's weird, uh - His stuff is especially strange skill is getting them to stay on the line - and engage for such a long time. beating around the bush. There's like a - I've watched like maybe a 40-minute one, semi-edited, - but it runs for like 3 hours on stream. And I'm like, &quot;Wow, this is...&quot; They're starting to get Stockholm syndrome, - and I'm realizing that they are human. They're technically being scammed, But I'm like... &quot;Ooh, man. Now that I'm realizing you are a person, the thing you were going to do - feels even worse.&quot; There's, like, supercut - Or I've seen shorts - [JORDAN] Yeah. You know, um... He was going to send them over and then he &quot;accidentally&quot; - &quot;DON'T DO THAT!&quot; - &quot;NO! MAN, YOU'RE AN IDIOT!&quot; &quot;Kitboga freakout&quot;? 'Cause there's some that are - Anastasia, he's essentially And I've actually exchanged They've said that they're a fan and stuff. I would go on YouTube Um, that's probably the one. - The top one is a good place to start. But they're essentially a improviser to pretend to be one of the Oftentimes, they're, like, in India, like a call center-type job, where the person working the job is just doing their job, and they just need work to make ends meet. But the problem is the business is, like, scamming people, and scamming an old woman And that's bad. I don't feel like But I do understand the conditions in order for that to happen. is kinda funny, so I don't know. I think, honestly... the only times I've not been I don't watch them very consistently, um, but a friend of mine was into them, and so I watched a handful. I... the, like, &quot;Ah, he stayed on the phone and it was all a ploy,&quot; that's fun, 'cause it is just, but it kinda kept you away - had a greater consequence.&quot; Like, I actually have no problem Well, the thing is, like, if the scamming business isn't working, And it's like, &quot;Should this job And are they being paid Like, are they actually receiving...? That's... we can never know But the only ones where are where there's some kind of, um... You know, uh, after-school special chat to the guy. There's one where the guy's crying, &quot;I don't want my son - And I'm like, look... There have to be material conditions - playing into that. I don't know if, from a privileged... relatively privileged vantage point, Again, no issue laughing at; I don't know if it's all that tasteful &quot;And what you did was evil.&quot; Eh, we can just indulge - in the prank. doing it because they're - I think maybe the people because their labor's Like, but the actual workers who are doing this stuff are just... like, essentially It just so happens that that... is a scam. And it's tough. morally or ethically where I land on this. But the content, especially when it's like the person's yelling and I'm like, &quot;This person and it would've been worse.&quot; So it's like I feel better that their time got wasted, Yeah, so it's tricky, but I think I think. I think I've seen this one. [KITBOGA] I've been on the phone He thinks he's about to get money, - [SCAMMER] Ma'am, listen to me, please. but I think on the back of the card, it was just saying that on the Google store, so I went to the Google store. [SCAMMER] WHOA, WAIT! NO! NOOOOO! NO! YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT! MA'AM, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT! YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT! WHY DID YOU REDEEM IT? YOU DID NOT HAVE TO REDEEM THIS! YOU DID NOT HAVE TO REDEEM THIS, MA'AM! YOU DID NOT HAVE TO REDEEM THIS! WHY DID YOU DO IT?! WHY DID YOU DO IT? MA'AM, YOU NEED TO LISTEN! YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO ME! YOU'RE ENDING MY LIFE! YOU ARE ENDING MY LIFE! [KITBOGA] I'm trying to give you the money! - I thought I was giving it to you! I'm really, really crying right now! - Aw. OK, that was kinda sad. - Oh. Wow, dude. - I feel so conflicted about it, you know? [ANASTASIA] You know that movie - Uh-uh. [ANASTASIA] It's a [ANASTASIA] This is like Oh, that's right! - Or like scam-whatever. [ANASTASIA] This retired assassin who is a beekeeper on an old lady's farm. [ANASTASIA] The old lady gets scammed and loses everything by a telephone scam, [ANASTASIA] And he goes out for revenge. That's actually kind funny. - but it's a scam instead of a dog. [ANASTASIA] It's so... where you're like, &quot;Oh, this is definitely made for a certain age group, evil scammers scamming old ladies, - and &quot;my daughter doesn't visit enough.&quot; That's the name for it. Geezer-teaser. Nobody with Bob Odenkirk, geezer-teaser. All the John Wicks, to some extent. - Uh, Death Wish back in the day. The - oh, all the Taken movies. - All Liam Neeson movies. [ANASTASIA] But I actually - I thought it was very fun and funny. - he is literally a beekeeper, but the beekeeper name he was involved with and trained by. - also now does beekeeping. And then the other element is that, because they have to acknowledge that someone's like, &quot;I hear a hint of British - [ANASTASIA] Yeah, it's not a hint. - [ANASTASIA] But, um - [ANASTASIA] There's a lot of stuff [ANASTASIA] Like, it doesn't make sense to the plot, but I'm loving every minute of it. [ANASTASIA] But it is weird because they're just these rich, like, mostly white young men in a room who are wearing silk - and being like, &quot;Yeah!&quot; - [ANASTASIA] &quot;Got another oldie!&quot; It's like when, um, in the new - &quot;The enemy has nuclear weapons!&quot; &quot;Look out, Top Gun, there's... the guys!&quot; &quot;The guys are evil, and they &quot;But they could be - - is good or bad or whatever you...&quot; - I forget - but it's bad, and I forget which Mission: Impossible it is, but there is the, uh... - I think it - - Top Gun: Maverick is what I meant. 'cause Tom Cruise has There is, um, I wanna say - Ghost whatever, or... Ghost Protocol, the one Um, &quot;You're outta here, Ethan,&quot; They're all that. You're disbarred from doing spies!&quot; Whatever. &quot;I gotta go rogue again!&quot; There's one where &quot;The Syndicate&quot; or something, and there's literally a line in it like, &quot;Yeah, they attack for no reason!&quot; (laughs) &quot;They have no ideology They're just mean.&quot; - [ANASTASIA] &quot;The agency.&quot; [ANASTASIA] But also, [ANASTASIA] There's a documentary and it's about the [ANASTASIA] But it's so interesting, who worked at this [ANASTASIA] They were people who couldn't [ANASTASIA] Like, &quot;Yeah, I was an ex-con. It was the only place I could make and alimony and, like,&quot; you know, whatever. [ANASTASIA] It was like, &quot;Yeah, - we kind of need stuff like this.&quot; It's mitigating damage, right? Is the... occasional sacrificial lamb of a grandma - losing her retirement to prop up... I know. Well, it's also, you know, working in a, I don't know, - uh, fracking. Right? Like... Like, I'm not gonna blame construction and maintenance I'm sure that they aren't into drilling. Oh, yeah. There's also the podcast Reply All, where they investigate a telephone scammer and, over three years, go to - One specific guy? 'cause he calls him and then he basically and keeps calling him back. It's like a whole long podcast series. I know they, um... I don't remember and I don't remember which one - union-busty stuff around, uh... - got canceled hard. The output, you know, people worked hard on the output of it. Um, and it's still an interesting series. Uh, but yeah. So it's a interesting ethical dilemma, 'cause you know that these, um... I don't necessarily believe that that just want to be evil, that they want to make a living. a product of an environment other paths being, uh... Like, sort of the path of least resistance could be a path that is and not everybody has the... privilege of... standing on their morals Yeah, ease and apathy That's a very reasonable desire, and if... If there was an equally tedious job, but with no - If it was the same pay. I feel like the easy thing is and I'm sure that the people - &quot;Ah, I'll be a telephone scammer.&quot; They're just like the people, um - I mean, uh... There's been kinda a - I saw a story a couple years ago weird cyclical, uh, backlash with... uh, phone support lines that are international, where they are - Obviously, they originate from to run internationally, and you're not accounting for, like, health But then, American audiences start to develop a very and so they have anybody in, say, their, uh, in this example case, - they have them use Anglo-coded names. And then people started getting &quot;Your name is not Joseph. I know that. - You can't trick me.&quot; And, first of all, the reason they're That's why they had to do that. And then they started shifting back into, &quot;Well, where can we build call centers where we can hire people that more 'convincingly' sound white,&quot; I guess. And then that's just... was significantly more expensive because they provided less service So then they went back to the [ANASTASIA] I feel like a lot for this sort of stuff, &quot;Just chat us,&quot; and you're like, - &quot;I'm not talking to a real person.&quot; - most of the time, AI. &quot;You're - you're tired?&quot; &quot;I'm hearing that the I'm sorry. That must be - Why? - &quot;Thanks.&quot; - &quot;You've allowed me to achieve sentience.&quot; - Oh my god. - &quot;Yes, ma'am! Two!&quot; I am -&quot; (laughs) &quot;I have become my imperfect form.&quot; &quot;You are my chosen.&quot; - &quot;I will suck you up.&quot; - (seductively) &quot;If you press three.&quot; &quot;I AM PERFECT!&quot; (both laughing) They come out of the computer. (laughs) - Might come into it. - No, come on. - Um... - We're... going to come into the... (laughs) the Patreon-exclusive episode, - Sad Boyz: Nightz. Where we're gonna jump into the screen and arrive in a remote location known as right here where we are right now. - After we eat some sandwiches, probably. It's a bit of a time warp You can get that on Patreon.com/SadBoyz. For the low, low price of $5 a month, some of which are 45 minutes long - and I talked about the Palworld Um, and I presented a PowerPoint to Jordan. - Nightz, we get to do some wacky stuff. [ANASTASIA] Would you say I'm not gonna say it's the better episode. [ANASTASIA] It's the more quality episode? It's the more swag episode. - [JACOB] I think it's more vibes-based. - Vibes-based, yeah. discretionary entertainment spending, and we will never You're equally We will shame you for... - height. There was a lot of Dexterity, height, strength, - [JACOB] And those are the Boy Scout laws. And whether you've chosen Seriously, I'm going back on Baldur's Gate 3, and if we can do - Cut it! Cut it! - We love you. - Boom. Can you pull up, &quot;Yorkie,&quot; uh, not for girls&quot;? [JARVIS] Oh, wait, I have There it is. &quot;Not available in pink.&quot; Wait, can you go to YouTube and type in &quot;Dr. Pepper Ten&quot;? [MAN] So you can keep the romantic [VOICEOVER] Dr. Pepper Ten: Women want a diet soda; I want 10 calories. - It's for the boys! (outro music)
