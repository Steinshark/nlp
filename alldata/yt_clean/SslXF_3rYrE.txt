Hello everyone from my Dessert Art Kitchen channel, today is the most beautiful day of the Summer months. I have a recipe for nutty lemon cookies, which is one of the most popular cookies. If you haven't tried it yet, I highly recommend you try this recipe. Moreover, it does not contain butter or margarine, it is a recipe that you can make very practical with very easy ingredients. Let's start my recipe right away. First of all, let's put our 2 eggs into a suitable bowl. Let's add a glass of granulated sugar. Let's beat it with a hand whisk. The most important tip of this cookie One of the points is to beat our liquid ingredients well with a whisk from the front, as if you were making a cake. I recommend whisking for at least 2 minutes. I whipped it for about 5 minutes and then added my other ingredients. After whisking the eggs and sugar until foamy, add the juice of 1 lemon. Let's add half a tea glass of oil. Let's add the packet of vanilla and the packet of baking powder. Let's grate the peel of 2 lemons. Do not grate the white parts so that there is no bitter taste. After adding the lemon zest, let's add a teaspoon of turmeric. We add it to make it less yellowish. If you don't have turmeric, you can omit it. Only the color will be slightly lighter. Let's whisk all our ingredients well with a whisk. At this stage, I whisked for about 2-3 minutes. Let's be careful to beat these steps as if we were making a cake. Whisking with a hand whisk will be enough. Now let's add the amount of flour little by little. I used 3 cups of flour in total. But while making this cookie, you must add the flour little by little, whisk and then add the other flours. First, I added a glass of flour. And I whisk, the consistency of the cookie dough will not be soft. It will have a slightly sticky consistency. But don't let this worry you in any way. Since we will let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, its consistency will thicken slightly. So let's be careful to make it by paying attention to the material measurements. Now I add my cup of flour. I beat it again with a whisk. I add half a glass of flour. After adding half a glass of flour, I mix it again with a whisk. Finally, I will add the remaining half cup of flour in a moment. As you can see now, its consistency is almost like cake dough. I add my last half cup of flour. Now I mix it with the help of a spatula. Our cookie dough is slightly soft as you can see closely. When a runny dough rests in the refrigerator, the moisture of the cookie mixture will disappear, there is no need to solidify it. Never add flour as an additional ingredient. It is a sticky dough, especially this way. If you have time in the refrigerator, freeze it for 2 hours, if not, freeze it in the freezer for half an hour. After freezing, take walnut-sized pieces from your dough with an ice cream spoon. Immediately add it into the powdered sugar. Roll in powdered sugar. Since it has a sticky consistency, it may stick to your hands. Dip your hands in powdered sugar beforehand. This way you can do it more easily. Or take pieces from your dough with a spoon like I'm doing right now. And add it directly into the powdered sugar without rolling it. And shape it into a round shape by moving your fingers with powdered sugar. You can prepare it more easily this way. We should definitely place them on our baking tray lined with baking paper, spaced apart. You can prepare your cookies in four layers, maximum four rows at a time, and place them on a baking tray lined with baking paper. I arranged them three at a time on my first tray because I thought it would spread too much. But on my second tray, I arranged them in four pieces. In total, I obtained 25 cookies from these ingredient measurements. Of course, if you make it much smaller, the number can be considerably higher. If you make it larger, you can get bigger cookies. The number may be less. A little sensitivity is required at this stage. As you can see, it is a dough that sticks to the hand very quickly. We need to act quickly because it is a sticky dough. If you like fruity desserts and fruit cookies in summer, lemon cracked cookies are just for you. It is a very light cookie, as it does not contain either Fresh Fresh or very light butter or margarine. Moreover, after making it, you can keep it at room temperature for a long time. Once the temperature has passed, you can keep it in a lidded glass or a lidded container for a long time. Cocoa crack cookies or lemon crack cookies If you wish, like me, after coating the powdered sugar in this way, you can put it on your baking tray. You can arrange them in a row or you can sprinkle them with granulated sugar before you coat them with powdered sugar. Then you can add the powdered sugar after it is coated, and that way you can add powdered sugar on top. It will be more crunchy due to the effect of sugar. I'm just using it right now. I prepared my lemon crack cookies by dusting them with powdered sugar. Bake our cookies in a preheated oven at 170 degrees until they crack. Let's cook it for about 10 to 12 minutes Because if you cook it too much After this minute, your cookies will be very hard, so we bake them in our oven. Let's take care to cook in a controlled manner Our cookies are baked, as you can see closely, they cracked very nicely. It had the appearance and consistency I wanted. I took a close look at the inner texture of one of them. I want to show you, it was incredibly delicious and I could smell the lemon scent. It was a very fresh and light cookie that you can feel.
