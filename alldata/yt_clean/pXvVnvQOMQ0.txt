&gt;&gt; Stephen: WE'RE BACK WITH BILL, AS I SAID, TOMORROW &gt;&gt; I'M GLAD YOU REMINDED ME, &gt;&gt; Stephen: WE'LL WAIT A FEW &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT ARE YOUR LAST WEEK? IT WAS ONE OF SORT OF THE CHANGE, MANY SAD WEEKS WE'VE HAD WORLD. DO YOU HAVE ANY REFLECTIONS ON &gt;&gt; ON BOTH SIDES OF IT. I MEAN FIRST OF ALL, YOU KNOW, I THINK CIVILIZATION IS A MILE WITHOUT THE POLICE ON THE JOB, IT WOULD BE THAT EVERY DAY. WITHOUT THE POLICE. &gt;&gt; Stephen: I BELIEVE THAT AND THERE SHOULD BE SOME AND WITHOUT IT, YOU KNOW SHALL MY LIVER. (LAUGHTER) YOU. &gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY. &gt;&gt; SO OBVIOUSLY ANY TIME ANYBODY IT'S JUST ABHOR ANT. AND YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO ANDS, CONDONE IT BUT I UNDERSTAND SO MANY VIDEOS OF SHOOTING I'M SURPRISED IT ACTUALLY DIDN'T &gt;&gt; Stephen: HUH-UH HUH. AND SAID FAMOUSLY THAT THOSE WHO POSSIBLE MAKE VIOLENT REVOLUTION &gt;&gt; RIGHT, YEAH. &gt;&gt; Stephen: AND BLACK LIVES RAISE AWARENESS OF THE FACT THAT LONG TIME AND IT COMES, IS PAID &gt;&gt; THIS GOES BACK TO, WELL, BUT ON TAPE RODNEY KING. RODNEY KING WAS WHAT, 1991? '92, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I MEAN WE ALL LOOKED AT THAT THESE COPS GET AWAY WITH THIS. YOU KNOW, NO MATTER WHAT RODNEY THEY GOT HIM ON THE GROUND AND HIM WITH A BATON AND SHOW THEY THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG HERE SO OBVIOUSLY VIOLENCE IS WRONG BUT YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN TALK THIS COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME. LIKE I SAY, WE ALL NEED THE I THINK WE RESPECT THEM BUT POLICE CULTURE. AND I DON'T THINK MOST POLICEMAN THINGS WE SEE ON TAPE AM BUT MENTALITY WHERE THEY PROTECT AND I THINK THAT-- . &gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU THINK IT'S WORSE THAN IT USED TO BE OR DO SEE SOME OF THE ABUSES OF &gt;&gt; THAT'S TRUE TOO. WE SEE IT MORE. I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK IT'S ANY I THINK WE JUST SEE IT. AND I THINK THE POLICE KIND OF ATTRACT THE WRONG KIND OF PEOPLE SORRY. &gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S KIND OF TRUE. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY WERE THE PERSON WHO WHEN AUTHORITY. THEY WERE KIND OF LOSERS AND NOW LORD IT OVER PEOPLE, YOU KNOW. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT CANNOT BE AND WE HAVE TO-- . &gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU ARE THINKING ARE YOU SORT OF PAINTING WITH A &gt;&gt; WE DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW. BUT CERTAINLY, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH TOO MANY COPS WHO ACT LIKE THAT. I MEAN ANY IS TOO MANY. AND YES, I DO THINK THAT'S A POLICE WORK. AND BY THE WAY, YOU CAN THERE ARE PSYCHOLOGY TESTS THAT WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE POLICEMEN. I THINK MOST POLICEMAN WANT TO I THINK MOST DO DO IT FOR THE BUT I ALSO THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, JOB, IT IS A DIFFICULT JOB. THAT YOU VOLUNTEERED FOR. YOU KNOW. NO ONE IS CON SCRIPTED INTO YOU WANTED TO DO IT. IT'S DANGEROUS, YES. BUT IT SAYS TO PROTECT AND SERVE REFERS TO US, YOU ARE PROTECTING YOU'RE NOT THERE TO PROTECH &gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT DOESN'T OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK. &gt;&gt; DID I SAY IT DOES? &gt;&gt; Stephen: NO, BUT THE THAT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO EXPECT SOMETIMES. &gt;&gt; NO, I DISN SAY THAT EITHER. I SAID I'M SURPRISED THAT IT YOU CANNOT SHOOT UNARMED PEOPLE FIRING BACK. SORRY. THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS. AND I HOPE IT GETS BETTER IN IT SHOULD GET BETTER. AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY MORE BUT YES, I DO THINK POLICE DEGREE. IT'S ONLY BEEN RECENTLY WHEN WE ONLY RECENTLY THAT THEY EVEN WRONG. BEFORE THAT IT WAS ALWAYS, THEY BY THE BOOK? WELL, MAYBE YOU NEED A NEW BOOK. (APPLAUSE). &gt;&gt; Stephen: THERE IS SOME OF THE SHOW IS OVER. &gt;&gt; Stephen: THIS IS ALL BEING NONE OF THIS IS GOING TO MAKE IT WE'RE GOING TO STICK WITH THE SO YOU KNOW, WE SAID EARLIER SIDES. DO YOU THINK THERE IS A WAY THAT THERE COULD BE A SESATION OF A AND THAT YOU HAVE TO BE ON ONE BECAUSE I THINK THAT LEADS TO &gt;&gt; IT SHOULDN'T BE SUCH, BUT IT POLICE STOP SHOOTING UNARMED AND THE POLICE STOP BUILDING FOR IMMEDIATELY. AGAIN, IT IS A DANGEROUS JOB. I'M SORRY IT IS, BUT YOU PROBING TOLL GUEST GETTING TO I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M LOOKING AT (LAUGHTER) TO BE LOOKING AT [BLEEP] ALL THAT IS THE JOB YOU SIGNED UP AND THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE A BAM BAM BAM. SO I DON'T GET HURT. AND AGAIN I DON'T THINK MOST &gt;&gt; Stephen: DO YOU THINK THEY &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK THEY ARE I DON'T. I MEAN WE'VE SEEN POLICE A LOT OF TIMES VERY CLOSE RANGE. AND DIDN'T EVEN HIT THE GUY. SPEND SOME TIME AT THE RANGE. &gt;&gt; Stephen: OR BE A PLAF &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I THINK WHAT IN THE LATE 60ST PEOPLE CALLED VERY WRONG. THAT WAS THE MENTALITY. AND EVER SINCE THEN, WE'VE KIND THAT. AND WE PUT THEM ON A PEDESTAL. YOU KNOW, WE-- YOU CAN'T ANYTHING. THEY'RE ALWAYS HEROES. WELL, THEY OFTEN ARE HEROES BUT ARE DOING A HUMAN JOB. AND AGAIN MOST OF THEM I THINK BECAUSE YES, YOU SEE SOME OF THE AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE BUT TO BE A COP IS ALSO HAS A A LOT OF PEOPLE KISSING YOUR A LOT OF FREE DONUTS. A LOT OF FREE STUFF, YOU KNOW. AND THAT'S FINE. BUT THAT'S THE JOB. AND I THINK MOST OF THEM WOULD &gt;&gt; Stephen: IT'S NOT A JOB &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T GO AND THEY DON'T WANT YOUR JOB. &gt;&gt; Stephen: THEY MIGHT. IT'S A NICE JOB. I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULDN'T WANT IT'S A VERY NICE JOB. I SIT HERE, I TALK TO YOU, THEY I WAS JUST DRINKING. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE RIGHT, I TAKE THAT THEY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOUR &gt;&gt; Stephen: THEY WOULD LOVE TO YOURSES IS ONCE A WEEK, THAT &gt;&gt; IT'S ACTUALLY NOT.
