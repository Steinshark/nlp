I repeat, the calamity We've been told to evacuate which is where most of and where I am about to go as well. We don't know when we or if we will be back on the air. The sky outside is purple. It's a deep shade of purple, and the clouds are swirling and things are crashing to the ground. And my God, it's horrible. The government's last reiterated to stay in your and just try to stay safe. We don't know what this is, I have to go now. God be with you, God be with you all.

Afraid. Excited. - [Speaker] I understand. Do you? Do you still feel good about this? - About my quest? Is that what you mean? - [Speaker] What do you think I mean? - I worry that I'm getting addicted to it. Like, I'm... I feel like I'm starting to - [Speaker] That's a danger. You said so yourself at - I said that I would stop I know, if it ever got too dangerous. - [Speaker] What are we doing? Really? What are we doing? (Wozzek chuckling) - I don't... I don't really know. - [Speaker] What's the end goal? - I want her back. - [Speaker] Is that even possible? - Must be. - [Speaker] She's dead. - I know that. - [Speaker] So how can she- - I don't know, but she does. - [Speaker] Are you sure You've been alone a - Thanks. I am aware. - [Speaker] So how can you be sure? - Because I see it! Because I see her! Because she's here every night! I'm sorry. - [Speaker] It's okay. I'm worried about us. - Yeah, I am too. But I don't have a choice. - [Speaker] There's always a choice. - Either I continue on and I find a way to or I give up and I dismantle this machine and I live alone in a broken world. There's nothing left. That's my choice. - [Speaker] I understand. - I know you do. (Wozzek sniffs) (soft gentle music) It's time. - [Speaker] Be careful, Wozzek. (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (machine rumbling) (electricity zapping) (machine humming) (Wozzek exhales) (ominous music) (ominous music continues) - Hi, Nellie. It's good to see you. Are you glad to see me? Please sit. I'm sure you're tired. I know I'm tired. It's been a long day. Living is a lot for one person. Oh, I'm writing us a song. It's not finished yet, Oh, the time we spent Lasted long, long through the years The time up in that big oak tree We had no care, no fears The tree was tall, its branches wide The birds, they called it home We'd sit up high, way And dream of where we might row I'm still working on it. Won't you sit, please? Please sit, like we used to. We can pretend. What is this Nellie, huh? What are you getting at? You come here and you just stand and stare and you never say a word. I miss you so much, Nellie. And I just wanna know I'm sorry. It's just hard being alone. (somber music) But one day soon, you will sit. And when you sit, I'll know And then it's just one step closer to you being here for real. And don't you want that, to (somber music) (somber music continues) You can hear me. You can hear me and you can communicate and that twitch meant yes! I'm going to work every day (somber music) Not long enough. (somber music) (Wozzek grunting) (Wozzek exclaiming) (low ominous music) (low ominous music continues) (Deleterian banging on door) (ominous music) (Deleterian banging on door) Who's there? (Deleterian laughing) - [Deleterian] We've met before. - We have? - [Deleterian] Oh, yes. Intimately. (Deleterian laughing) - I don't recognize your voice. Show yourself through the window. - [Deleterian] In time. We are going to see a lot - And why is that? - [Deleterian] Why do you think? Take a guess. - How can I guess if I - [Deleterian] Being lost and confused can lead to the greatest You have nothing to hold you back. - Do you want to kill me? - [Deleterian] That is - Who are you? How did you survive the calamity? - [Deleterian] Again, those which will get answered in time. Here's a question for you. How did you survive the calamity? Were you here in this house far, far away from the nightmares in the cities, from the purple skies and the things that - No. We were at our home and and we saw the purple skies and fled and found this place. - [Deleterian] You said we. Are you alone? Where is your other? - My wife died. A thing killed her. - [Deleterian] Oh. A tragedy, no doubt. - Yes, it was. - [Deleterian] And so - I've searched for other survivors. I've walked miles in all directions. I've scanned the radio waves. But I've found no one so My wife comes and sees me sometimes. - [Deleterian] Well, It pleases me. - Well, I'm glad that it pleases you. Look, who are you? What do you want from me? I have some food I can spare, but I'm not opening that door. - [Deleterian] I think one way or another, but not tonight. Patience is one of my strongest virtues. - I ask you again, what do you want from me? - [Speaker] A conversation partner, a pen pal, a brain, a mind, someone with a bit of philosophy It is a stark cold world, isn't it? We all need a little stimulus, something to make us feel alive. - You want me to talk to you? - [Deleterian] I will visit We will talk. One night, you will learn my I hope eventually to meet your wife. - Tell me your name now. - [Deleterian] Sleep well Friends are so, so important. Don't you think? Especially now at the end of all things. Keep this door locked tight. There is evil out in the dark. (Deleterian laughing) Oh, the time we spent Lasted long, long through the years The time up in that big oak tree We had no care, no fears Oh, we both did die We shall die again But next time, instead, The big oak tree will die in bed, amen Amen, amen, amen Oh - Look at you. All right. Oh, and one day, Nellie left (Wozzek humming) Oh It doesn't work during the daytime, which I don't totally understand, I guess ghosts traditionally so it must have something to It's still hard to say. It's hard to think. I was able to see her last Up until yesterday. It was only a feeling. But last night, I saw her. I'm not sure that she saw me, however. She was staring straight It was like looking at A painting, a portrait of But it was her. I tried to touch her and it was so strange 'cause my hand didn't pass through her or something like you'd see in a cartoon. I just could feel emptiness there. The world died too many Everything turned upside down. Ghosts are real, creatures I couldn't save Nellie the first time. I will save her now. (gentle music) (cassette player buzzing) (&quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot; music playing) (&quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot; continues) (cassette player buzzing) (&quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot; music playing) (spoon clinking) - [Speaker] How many days - Well, let's think about that. So it's been four years since Nellie left, then another five before that I think, so that's nine years. So 365 days a year. Give or take, that's 3,285 days. That's a lot of days. - [Speaker] That is indeed a lot of days. I'm sorry, Wozzek. - I'm sad, you know? All those days that could but the universe had to take her from me. - [Speaker] Yes, I understand. - I know you do. You're the only one that could. Am I crazy talking to myself? - [Speaker] I don't think - I don't want to go to a loony bin. - [Speaker] No loony bins anymore. No one to take you to one either. - Well, small blessings, I suppose. (low ominous music) (low ominous music continues) Why do you think she only - [Speaker] Perhaps she can't speak yet. She may want to, but she's - She moved her finger. She told me she wanted to come back fully. - [Speaker] That's wonderful, Wozzek. That's really wonderful. It's progress. - Yeah, small progress. I should be thankful. I am. I am thankful. Do you see her eyes when she looks at me? It looks like she's unhappy. Do you see that? - [Speaker] I know what you mean. - Why would she be unhappy with me? Sometimes it even looks - [Speaker] And why would that be? - I don't know. - [Speaker] You don't? - Do you? - [Speaker] No. - Then why do you ask? - [Speaker] Because you asked, Wozzek. - What? So why would she be angry at me? - [Speaker] Why is anyone angry at anyone? - Why? - [Speaker] Because they aren't acting the way we want them to act. - Why should I be acting? - [Speaker] I'm not saying she's right, but perhaps your actions belie your words. - How? I work day and night to bring her back, so how do my actions... - [Speaker] Wozzek, are you okay?

(Wozzek groaning) (Wozzek screaming) (Wozzek screaming continues) (Wozzek screaming continues) (trash can rattling) (Deleterian banging on door) Go away. - [Deleterian] That is not a kind way to greet your neighbor. - Please leave me alone. Just for tonight. - [Deleterian] From the you must have had a very bad night. Are you ill? - Yes, I am ill. - [Deleterian] Sickness will pass. Did you have a nice day? - What? What do you care about my day? - [Deleterian] I am trying to to grease the wheels before we get into the real - I don't want to have I want nothing to do with meat. - [Deleterian] Oh, see, for - Oh, I don't have the energy for this. - [Deleterian] In the before days. - I can't remember anything from before. - [Deleterian] I'm sure It wasn't that long ago. - I remember restaurants and eating outside and movies. - [Deleterian] Tell me, - Nellie and I would but we'd always have the same thing. Grilled chicken salad for her. And I'd have the pasta dish. Well, we'd do the same thing every week. And then we'd go and see a movie. - [Deleterian] Mm, yes. What was the last film - I can't remember what it was called. I loved it. Nellie... Nellie was afraid. - [Deleterian] Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Please continue. - No, no. No more, please. No more. - [Deleterian] You disappoint me. We were just getting to the good stuff. - What, do you like hearing about my pain? - [Deleterian] Not your pain. Your happiness. I like hearing about how - Well, talking about it - [Deleterian] If you let but I don't know if it's time - I could just walk over to that door and look out the window. - [Deleterian] I can - I haven't told you my name. - [Deleterian] Oh, haven't you? - No. No, I don't believe I have. - [Deleterian] Come to the window, Wozzek. I will show you my face and - I can't see you. - [Deleterian] I am standing at the edge of the light, Wozzek. Look deeper. Do not be afraid. Remember, I am a friend and (tense music) (somber music) (somber music continues) Stumbling all around, So funny Stumbling here and there Stumbling everywhere I stepped right on her toes (Wozzek exclaims) She bumped my nose I fell and when I rose I felt ashamed And told her That's the latest step, That's the latest step My honey Notice all the pep, notice all the pep Notice all the pep She said stop mumbling Though you are stumbling I like it just a little bit (Wozzek screaming) (Wozzek laughing) (Wozzek coughing) Young and small, short and tall Nice and slow When the band starts playing Stumbling all around, Stumbling all around, so funny Stumbling here and there Stumbling everywhere I stepped right on her toes And when she bumped my nose I fell and when I rose I felt ashamed (Wozzek laughing) (electricity zapping) (low ominous music) - Wozzek. You're drunk. It's the middle of the day. - What else is there to do? - Be together. Dance, play games. Go for a walk. - [Wozzek] It's too dangerous. - It's daytime. - It's too dangerous. - You are not the man I married. - Oh, am I not? - [Nellie] No. - Well, who did you marry? - A kind man. A confident man. A competent man. - I'm sorry to disappoint. - [Nellie] You said you were - Tomorrow. - Always tomorrow. - Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. - Wozzek, if I weren't I would leave you. Wozzek? Wozzek. (Wozzek gasping) Hello, Wozzek. - You can talk. - Yes, Wozzek. - I'm so sorry, I was... - You were drinking. - [Wozzek] I'm sorry. - Don't apologize. What we do in our own - You're sitting in your chair. - I need you to do - [Wozzek] What is it? Anything. - I need you to get dressed. I need you to come with me. - Come with you where? - Just get dressed. - What, but it's night. - Everything will make sense when you go to this place with me. Get dressed, Wozzek! - You don't understand. The creatures, the things, - They come at midnight. It's 9:00 PM, we have plenty of time. - It's too dangerous. - Yes or no, Wozzek? - Okay. Anything for you. - Just trust me, husband. - Trust you? (thunder rumbling) (tense music) (Wozzek screaming) Oh, God! (Wozzek crying out) (door slamming shut) - [Speaker] What's going on? - You tell me. Nellie was here and I went with her. And then I'm covered in blood. - [Speaker] Slow down. - I won't slow down. I can't slow. You slow down! What happened? What happened? - [Speaker] I don't Calm down. - Quit telling me to calm down! - [Speaker] I'm sorry. (Deleterian banging on door) - [Deleterian] Hello, Wozzek. - Now is not a good time. - [Deleterian] I smell blood. Are you hurt, my friend? - It's not mine. - [Deleterian] Whose blood is it? - You need to go away. - [Deleterian] Oh, I wouldn't Not in your time of need. (ominous music) I have to confess something, my friend. I was watching you earlier, - You could see her? - [Deleterian] She was very beautiful. Is that your wife? - Yes. - [Deleterian] You are - I'm relieved. - [Deleterian] Why relieved? - Because it means I'm not insane. - [Deleterian] Now, let's not be hasty. (Deleterian Laughing) Sorry. Just a little humor to lighten the mood. - Where was she taking me? - [Deleterian] You don't remember? - No. - [Deleterian] You were - What, why would she take me there? She told me that everything - [Deleterian] Perhaps - She wouldn't lie to me. - [Deleterian] Everyone lies, Wozzek. Even you. - What were we doing at the cliff's edge? - [Deleterian] I can tell you what I saw, but it's easier if I show you. Come outside, my friend. You can trust me. - Never. You'll kill me. - [Deleterian] Maybe so, maybe no. One day, we'll be together, No longer separated by this door. (Deleterian Chuckling) (Wozzek breathing heavily) (machine rumbling) (electricity humming) (electricity humming continues) - There you are. - Sit down, Wozzek. - What is happening? - You don't remember what happened? - No, I don't remember anything. I woke up covered in blood. Whose blood was that? - That was my blood. - How is it your blood? You're dead. - Am I? - I watched you die. - The machine, it's working. - [Wozzek] You mean... - You're bringing me back. Touch me, Wozzek. (Wozzek gasping) (Wozzek gasping continues) - Oh, it's been so long (Wozzek breathing heavily) It's been so long since - Bring yourself together, Wozzek. - I'm sorry. I have needs. - Yes, you have needs. Last night, we went up and I gave you a choice. Two ways to be with me, an And you chose the hard way. And the hard way involves You didn't like the things you had to do. And you did things, husband, I didn't know you would ever be capable of until I saw what you were capable. We're almost at the end, now. I'm getting stronger. You're almost at the end of your quest. How does that make you feel? - So happy. So beyond happy. - Good. This is a world without much - How will I know when you're ready, ready to be back permanently? - [Nellie] You'll know. - But then you'll just be no need for the ghost machine? - Oh, there will always be a - I miss you so much. - Yes, I know you do. - And now I know you miss me too. - Do I? - Why else would you come back to visit? - Yes, why else? I have to go now. You're almost at the end. Be strong. - I can't wait to make love to you again. - Goodnight, Wozzek. Try not to lose yourself (ominous music) (Wozzek grunting) (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (Wozzek breathing heavily) (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (Wozzek sniffling) (upbeat music) (cassette player whirring) - [Wozzek] Where are we going? - [Nellie] Follow me. Do you see? - [Wozzek] It's our spot. - [Nellie] Our special place. (cassette player clicking) (cassette player clicking continues) Our special place. Sit. - [Wozzek] It all went so wrong. - [Nellie] I know. - [Wozzek] I want to make it right. - [Nellie] I know. - [Wozzek] How? - [Nellie] Jump off the cliff, Wozzek. - What, why? Why? - [Nellie] To be with me. It's so much easier. You'll feel no pain. - You want me to kill myself? - [Nellie] The dead belong together. - But I don't want to die. - [Nellie] Yet you want me. - I want you alive. I don't want both of us dead. - [Nellie] Don't you? - Why would you say that? - You've come to resent me. - No. - No. - I was sick. Dying. (Nellie coughing) - [Wozzek] I didn't resent you. I didn't want you to die. - You were so tired. You didn't sign up for this. - I was so tired. - In a world where everything is dead, what's one more, what's two more? There's no shame in dying, Wozzek. Everyone has to go sometime. - But I'm afraid. - You have a choice. Jump off this cliff and - No. No, I can feel you. You can feel me. Can't you see, it's working. You are flesh and bone and blood and hair and mind and soul and beauty. And here we are at the finish line. And you want me to end everything? No. No! I refuse! Oh, no, no, no, no. Please. - [Nellie] There's still time. Either way, you'll get the same outcome. But the choice is yours. - No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no! (Wozzek breathing heavily) (Wozzek breathing heavily continues) (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (Wozzek gasps) - What? (Deleterian laughing) - Don't panic, friend, neighbor. (Wozzek breathing heavily) You'll never make it I am much, much faster than you. And this room is small. - You are not my friend. - Your words wound me more (door slamming shut) Sit, please. (Wozzek breathing heavily) Very well, let us palaver. What do you remember about that first day? - Of the calamity? - [Deleterian] Yes. What do you remember? - It was Christmas day. - [Deleterian] And what were you feeling? - Fear, uncertainty. - [Deleterian] Did you - Yes. - And what about Nellie? - [Wozzek] She was - [Deleterian] Stronger than you? - [Wozzek] Always. - [Deleterian] What made - I'm weak. I've always been weak. (Deleterian growling) - So why is she dead and you are not? - She was taken by a thing. - By a thing like me, you mean? - By you? You ripped her apart. - Do you blame me? For it is my nature to rip It is my purpose. You must be wondering why what my reason is for being here, why I choose now to visit you. - It has crossed my mind. - I was born to consume, endlessly hungry, and thrown from the sky to eat the world and eat it I have. I have prowled the arctic the mountains of your your cities, your homes. I have eaten humans and animals and the grass of your fields. I have even eaten my own kind, every last one of them, all yet my hunger remains. That is my curse. I have eaten everything, And though my gut growls with the urge to consume I fear being alone on this world for once I have eaten you, what is there left to eat but myself? Wozzek, I am not a creature built for things such as fear or doubt. That is a human gift. And so, friend, neighbor, answer me this. If all is dead around you and you no longer contribute except your own continued existence, why do you persist? Why cling to life when there is none? Why not walk outside and and be a part of the world again? Why not fling yourself from a cliff and see what lies beyond this world? Isn't that worth the bet since this world is broken? (Wozzek crying softly) (ominous music) - What is beyond this world? - Comfort, connection. I only know what I can see and that I have consumed, which But when they speak to me, the spirits of the dead that they seem at peace. They do not seem angry at A small boon, I suppose. - Why do you care if they're angry at you? - Because I'm alive and I have a soul. What I did not have is a choice, until I chose to let You are welcome. Wozzek, look. It's Christmas, my friend. (&quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; music playing) (Wozzek exhales) (&quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; music playing) - Nellie. (&quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; music playing) - Hello, Wozzek. - What is your Christmas wish? (&quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; music playing) - I have... - I will leave you now Thank you for the time we have shared. I trust I will see you again, my friend. (&quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; music playing) (&quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; continues playing) (&quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; continues playing) - Merry Christmas, Nellie. Are you back? Is this it? - Just one last step to - [Wozzek] What's that? - One more time. Full power. - And then you'll be back forever? You won't go away? - I'll have all the strength I need. (Wozzek exhales) - Let's finish this. (electricity crackling) (electricity crackling continues) (machine whirring) (machine whirring continues) (machine whirring continues) (machine whirring continues) (machine whirring continues) (machine whirring continues) (machine whirring continues) (machine whirring fading) (gentle music) Nellie? Did it work? - I think it did. - How do you know? - I just do. - Can I come to you? - Yes, Wozzek. (gentle music) - You feel different. - [Nellie] Because I am fully here. - I could still feel the death - Now I am no longer dead. You brought me back. You did it. You really let yourself go. - What? - You've gotten fat. Well, fatter. - I don't understand - This house used to be so nice. It was our oasis, refuge And now look at it. Ugh, you have not been a good - It's hard being alone. I needed you to- - To clean up, to follow you around, making sure you're happy while - Nellie, I am so confused. - I know you are. I tried to offer you an easier You could have died in ignorance, which for you would've been But you refused my help. And I want you to know that because I do still love you I will love you until and the universe grows cold. It is that strong of a love. But that doesn't mean - Hate me? - It was the end of the world. But still, we had each other. And then you had whiskey. But still, we had each other for a time. And then you had whiskey but I didn't have you. Not like I used to. But we carried on, didn't we? We continued to exist. And despite everything, I thought we still had each other's backs. - I always had your back. I nursed you when you were sick. - Out of an obligation. - No. And when I started to feel just a little bit better, what then? My loving, dutiful I needed space. And I got that space by to let the warmth and the wind and the sky take some of And on one of those days... - Oh, I don't wanna talk about that day. You're back. It's a new life and a new start. It's why I've brought you back so we could be in love (Nellie shushing) - On one of those days, The creatures prowled in the daylight. I ran, I ran for my life. And I called out to you. Do you remember what I said, Wozzek? Wozzek! - Nellie! You called for help. - Where were you? - I didn't know where you were. - Yes, you did. - Nellie! Nellie, Nellie! (Nellie groaning) - Wozzek, help! Wozzek, help! Help me, help me! Wozzek! (Wozzek screaming) (tense emotional music) (tense emotional music continues) - I couldn't have saved you. - Yes, you could have. You know you could have. - It was too close. - We were two against the world. But when push came to - I was scared. - So was I! - If I'd left the house, - But at least you would've tried. - What? This is unfair. - This is unfair! How is this unfair? Wozzek, how is this unfair to you? - I brought you back! I dedicated my life to bringing you back! - You dedicated your life, the life you've saved for And now you want thanks and so that you could have to tell you how good of a man you are, to fuck you, try to atone for what you And even after death, you a tool for life, but really a prison. I was at peace, Wozzek. Over there, there is peace And every day for four years, so you could sit and talk to and try to make yourself feel - You're not Nellie. You're something else. I brought back a demon or something. - Oh, I'm Nellie, all right. But you're right, Wozzek, You did against all odds You regenerated me. My body is mine again. My mind is clear and my soul has purpose. And for that, I thank you. I loved you once, but And in a world where that's a lot of desires ignored. Goodbye for now, Wozzek. - I don't understand. - You will. (ominous music) - Hello, old friend. (Deleterian growling) - I thought we were friends! - We are, and I will see you again. Your lovely wife has assured me. (Wozzek breathing heavily) - No, no. No! (tense music) (&quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; music playing) (&quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; continues playing) (&quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; continues playing) (&quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; continues playing) (&quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; continues playing) (electricity zapping) (&quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; music playing) - Hello, Wozzek. (&quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; music playing) Can you speak yet? Yes or no? (&quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; music playing) That's incredible, isn't it? Peace and restfulness on the other side. How are you feeling? Let me rephrase. Can I feel you? Oh, good. Stronger, some meat on those bones. Does it hurt you like it did me? Feel it regrowing? (&quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; music playing) Birth is always painful. (&quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; music playing) I am sorry, dear husband, but When you fed me to the monster, you left him without anything to eat.
