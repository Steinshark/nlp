We're the last ones out. It's embarrassing. Not quite the last. Who is he? You know ... what's his name? The writer. You know who I mean. Married that Southern belle that was supposed to be the original flapper. Oh, and they were such a beautiful couple. Pictures in magazines and papers. They used to do wild things, like ride around on the top of taxis and jump into public fountains. Oh, I know the one. I see his stories in the Saturday Evening Post. He seems to write a lot about himself and his wife. That's him. Oh, Arthur. What's the name of that writer that was carrying on in the observation lounge last night? ('Crazy Rhythm' plays) Lyrics: They say that when a highbrow meets a lowbrow Walking along Broadway Soon the highbrow, he has no brow Aint it a shame? And you're to blame. What's the use of prohibition? You produce the same condition. Crazy rhythm. I've gone crazy too. Are you alright, sir? Afraid I've made a mess of your tablecloth. Not to worry, sir. No harm done. What about your sleeve? I'm alright. Shall I take a damp cloth to it, sir? No, no, I'm fine. Don't fuss, Cyril. Don't fuss. Anything more I can bring you, sir? What about you, madam? More coffee? We'll be out of your way as soon as the wine is gone. We're not keeping you, are we Cyril? Not at all, sir. Beg pardon, sir, but the name is Sydney actually. Sydney. Sorry. Not Cyril. Sydney. Thank you, sir. Do you know who I am, Sydney? Why yes, sir. You're Mr. Fitzgerald, sir. I'm F. Scott Fitzgerald. Yes, sir. The name is not unknown, even in your country. I expect you've heard of The Great Gatsby. The Great, uh ... Gatsby. Yes. I believe I have, sir. Something to do with munitions, hasn't he? Great Gatsby is a book. A book, sir? The London Times adored it. The Manchester Guardian said its author was the most gifted and promising of all the young American novelists. Books and Bookmen called it a huge advance over Mr. Fitzgerald's previous success. 'This Side of Paradise' ... Dear god. My wife has found her tongue. Yes, dear? What is it? Let's go. Very well, chatterbox. We seem to be the last. I apologize. Please don't think badly of us. That's not necessary, sir. Not to you perhaps. Think of it as answering my need rather than yours. Well, thanks very much. Very generous. Not generous. Selfish. Selfish, sir? Selfish. See you tomorrow. Good night, sir. Madam. Night, Cyril. &lt;jazzy big band music plays&gt; (Train conductor announces stop) You big lump. How are you? I'm fine. Fine. How are you? I missed you. Zelda! Ah, Zelda. Who like a Nicean bark of yore ... beautiful as ever. What a gallant liar you are, John. Now, who is this mysterious lady in the Paris hat? This lady, sir, is my daughter. The renowned world traveler and champion croquet player. Bonjour, Mademoiselle. Bonjour, Monsieur. I hope you had a pleasant trip. Oui. &lt;speaks in French&gt; You can speak English now, darling, We're home. A French governess and a chauffeur. Now, that's what I call swank. Philip was a professional boxer before he took to the wheel. He's a good man to know. I got into a couple of pretty rough scrapes this summer. Where? Bars. Where the hell do you think? I had the honor of being incarcerated on two separate occasions. How was the trip otherwise? There was no otherwise. It was all booze and general unpleasantness. You and Zelda? Zelda has turned quiet. What? Quiet. Didn't you notice? I noticed something. We quarreled in Paris. Lord, how we quarreled. Unbelievable, the things we said to each other. Very ugly. She's been quiet ever since. Sometimes she doesn't speak for hours. Was it another woman? No. Did she? No, that's not the problem. Even when we say it is. It's never other people. It's us. Something about the way we are. Each man kills the thing he loves. Don't quote Oscar Wilde to me. I've got a hangover. Can't you dredge up something appropriate from Ella Wilcox or Edgar Guest? There were days when they hurt each other purposely, taking almost a delight in the thrust. What's that? The Beautiful &amp; Dammed by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Get any work done this summer? A few short stories. Nothing I'm proud of. What about the new novel? I'd put my soul in hock if I could get six months free Well ... as soon as you're settled in here ... As soon as I get settled in here, I'll have to grind out another story to pay for this trip. I haven't even got an idea, let alone characters or a plot. I'm dry at the moment. Could be it's not my business, but ... You &amp; Zelda could cut down a bit on the high life. It's none of your business. You don't have to spend every penny you earn. We're way past that stage. We've already spent money I may never earn. I'm probably a year's income in debt already just to my agent and my publisher. How's the law racket? The law racket? A little slow right now. What's the matter with us, Beeks? Ten years ago, we thought we'd be millionaires by this time. These are the boom years. Why aren't we booming? We're alright. We're alive. We have that distinction, yes. Cotton Griffin is dead. Didn't you know? No. How? He killed himself and his wife. Why? You tell me. I heard about Debroux falling out a window. Falling or jumping. George Martin getting beaten up in a speakeasy and On the whole, not an auspicious year for Princeton men. When you think about all that, you realize we're in pretty good shape. We're damn well off in fact. Speak for yourself, John. ('Back In Your Own Backyard' plays) Lyrics: The bird with feathers of blue Is waiting for you Back in your own backyard Back in your own back yard Oh you can go to the East Go to the West But someday you'll come Weary at heart Back where you started from You'll find your happiness lies Right under your eyes Back in your own backyard Chances are it's open. I arranged for a couple of cleaning ladies to come in this morning. They're probably upstairs. I told them to do the bedrooms first. Anyway ... You're back at Ellerslie. You might have found me something a little less cavernous, John. First time you saw it, when you first came to live here last year ... you said it would bring you - your exact words - judicious tranquility. Judicious? That's a lawyer's word. It's what you said. I was wrong. Dead wrong. It's too big and unfriendly. It's never brought us anything but unhappiness. It never will. It hates us. ('Back In Your Own Backyard' continues playing) Lyrics: You'll see your castles in Spain Through your window pane Back in your own back yard. You'll find your happiness lies Right under your eyes Back in your own backyard Back in your own backyard. (song ends with jazzy flourish) ('The Nutcracker Suite' plays) (jazz standard plays) Yeah. What do you want? &lt;speaks in French&gt; I told you earlier. I have to work tonight. Dommage. I have to make money to pay your salary. Vous comprenez? I ... uh ... get the car ready? Yes? Get the car ready, no. Now go away. Go to bed. Scram! Did you wear this in the war? I never got overseas. I missed the war. I wanted to go. I was actually on the boat. Then news of the armistice came and they marched us off again. It was all over and I missed it. I wanted to see that war in the worst way. In school, I wanted to make an impression, but I never had enough allowance. I wanted to play football, But, I was too slight. I was always getting banged up. I wanted ... Yes? What? Monsieur wanted. I forgot what I was going to say. You go ahead and put the car away. I won't be going anywhere. Don't give me that smug 'I told you so' look. Monsieur. You heard me. Madame dance much tonight. Yes. Do you dance, sir? We used to dance together. We did everything together. She could drink as much as any man in the room and still be the wittiest, most exciting, most beautiful ... &lt;asks question in French&gt; What? &lt;stammers&gt; She uh ... She does don't come out with you anymore. No. She does don't come out with me anymore. Yeah. Who is it? Emile Zola. Who? Victor Hugo. You a member here? Just tell him Andy sent me. Andy? Andy who? Andy Jackson, sir. Moonshine's gift to the nation. Here's his picture. In case you forgot what he looked like. Here's another. Oh yeah. Oh, no. No, I'm sorry. What's the matter? Too few Andy's? I'm sorry, Mr. Fitzgerald. But, you remember what happened the last time you were in here. Last spring. No chance of repeats, pal. Never chew my cabbage twice, as the fellow says. This gentleman is my physician. The eminent French gynecologist, Doctor Louis Pasteur. Famous for having treated Isidore Duncan for athlete's foot. If he could speak English, he'd tell you. My health is too delicate to let me do anything ... but sit quietly on the sidelines and observe the gentle pleasures of your charming establishment. ('Bye Bye Blackbird' plays) Lyrics: Pack up all my cares and woes Here we go, singing low Bye, bye, blackbird. Where somebody waits for me &lt;song cuts off&gt; Is it my birthday? Not yet, darling. Not quite yet. Soon. Don't forget my dolls. ('Bye Bye Blackbird' continues to play) &lt;speaks in French&gt; &lt;Fitzgerald laughs&gt; I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about, you dimwitted fop. &lt;continues speaking in French&gt; &lt;Fitzgerald responds loudly&gt; Come sir, give us more wine! Ah, shut up! I beg your pardon? I said shut up. Shut up! Did he say shut up? What would that be in French, doctor? Fermez la bouche! That's rather personal, isn't it? That's strikes me as being rather personal. Do I know you, sir? You don't have to know me to keep quiet. Fitzgerald is my name. F. Scott Fitzgerald. Yeah. So what? I wrote the book about the pushy little man who winds up floating face-down in his own swimming pool. Look, we're not interested in your pedigree. I thought somebody at your table might have read it. But, I hadn't reckoned with the rate of illiteracy in your part of the room. You see. That's how he got me. Caught me off guard. Try that again. Ha Ha! Got you that time, my dear doctor. Boy, if I had that punch ready when that baby came over in the speakeasy ... hehehehehe Well? It will wake the child. Shut the door then. Come on, come on. Try to catch me off guard. You'll break my mirror! Good. Stop! I hate to say this, but it's a whorehouse mirror. She spends more time with that thing than she does with me. Come on, baby. Try that again. Oh! Yeah. Yeah. Scott, I want you to stop. So what? I want you to stop dancing. What good does it do you? I love to dance. Rubbish! I have to have something of my own. It can't all be your work, your world! Everywhere we go, everything we do, everyone we see, is because of you. You haven't done too badly. You're not exactly anomalous. I made you famous. I don't want to be famous. Oh, you don't?! That's not me. I'm not a girl in a book. I'm not a girl in a short story. I am myself. I want myself back. You give me back my self! You don't want yourself. You don't want to be yourself. You want to be me. No. Miss competition of 1928. That's not true. That's not true. You had to write. You had to paint. Now, you have to be a famous ballerina. Don't you know? Dancers start to train before they're ten years old. You're almost 30. I danced when I was little. I was a wonderful dancer. I will dance again. You're kidding yourself. Last winter in Hollywood, you said I had no right to say anything sassy about that little pompous baby star you were carrying on with. I wasn't carrying on. I never touched her, and you know it. You said she was worth more than me because she worked at something. She did something. Well, now I'm trying to do something. And all you can do is pick on me. That's why you're doing it, isn't it? Revenge. It's not the reason. You're punishing me for saying that. You're punishing me because of that girl. I do want to understand this all. And it's not because of that. It's not because I want to be you. It's just I want to be somebody wonderful. So you can love me again. Liar. Oh, Scott! You promised you wouldn't! You'll cut yourself. You did it because you know it's the one thing in the house I care about. You're going to cry now? Please don't cry. She'll never be held again. Zelda, please. You seemed so kind at first. Daddy said it's wrong. He is wrong for you. I should have listened. Stop it. Now, see what he's done. Broke her all to pieces. Please, darling. Please don't cry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I was somebody once. You're somebody now. You're my wife. No, I was somebody in my own right. They said I was the prettiest girl in Montgomery, Alabama. The prettiest and the smartest. Well, Mr. Fitzgerald was just one of my beaus in those days. Just one of many. Don't. Don't. I chose him tho. I won him. I could do it again if he left me. Baby, you haven't lost me. I feel like I've lost you sometimes. You spend so much time on the dancing. I love you so much. Don't you know that? Poor child. You got a handkerchief? There's blood on this. Oh goofball. You hurt yourself. No. No. Yes. Seems like my body's the only place we ever meet anymore. &lt;somber piano music plays&gt; &lt;Radio Announcer talks about baseball game&gt; Voiceover: A day came when I went into Tarleton for a haircut and ran into a nice fellow named Bill Knowles. &lt;big band music plays&gt; Andy! Who's that? Bill Knowles. Knowles. Hey, how are you? I didn't know you were stationed down here. I'm not as of tomorrow morning. I've been transferred to Texas. Aviation. Hey, that's keen. Yeah, it's what I wanted. How long you been here? Couple of weeks. Find a girl? Not yet. Better get moving, fellow. There's four Ivy League second Louies down here for every girl. Any kind of looks and any kind of family. I'm only interested in the best. Calhoun Goodwin Hopper. What's that? Three top girls in Tarleton. Ailie Calhoun, Betty Lee Goodwin ... Say no more. Is she number one? Who? Amy Calhoun. Ailee. Absolutely. Numero uno. Absolutely. Numero uno. Then she's the one I want to meet. Just like that? Just like that. I marvel at your presumption, little man. But it just so happens, by the sheerest coincidence that you are in luck. You are in the most fantastic luck. What are you doing around seven tonight? Is this her street? Yes. Do you think she'll like me? Well, that's up to you, isn't it? Listen, as soon as the pleasantries are over, you make your excuses and scram. This is my last day with her. And I don't intend to spend it with you hanging around, batting those big blue eyes at her. As to what happens between you two after I'm gone ... Well, if it weren't you, it would be somebody else. And you'd prefer your successor to be a Harvard man. At the very least. There's the house. They'll keep us waiting exactly 10 minutes. It's tradition. I'm so sorry I'm late. Why, I thought I heard you come 10 minutes ago. I mean, um ... I'm sure I heard somebody down here. Pacing up and down. Why, Canby, how are you? Uh, Canby, honey, I want to whisper to you. &lt;whispers angrily&gt; Alright then. We'll make it Thursday. Are you sure? I'm sure. He's a pilot, isn't he? You suppose he uses those on his plane? Hitch on. Contact. Giddy up. Come on in. I don't just know your name. Oh uh, Ailee. This is Lieutenant Andrew McKenna. How do you do? Hello. Andy was at Harvard with me. Ran into him down by the hotel. He was coming this way. So I said, stop in for a moment and meet the belle of Tarleton. Oh, Bill. Isn't he terrible? McKella? McKenna. Well, if you're Irish, come into the parlor. &lt;sings&gt; There's a welcome there for you. How long you been stationed here, Lieutenant? Not long. About two weeks. I didn't think I'd seen you before. Don't you ever come to the dances at the country club? I haven't. Not yet. Bill and I are going out there tonight. Perhaps you'd care to join us? Well, if you'd ... Actually, Andy has a date tonight. In fact, if he doesn't hurry, he's going to get stood up. Aren't you, Andy? Yes, that's right. Oh, Bill. Must you rush away? He's afraid he must. I'm afraid I must. I'll see you out. After Bill goes, I'll be sitting here all alone night after night. Ha! You hush now, Lieutenant Knowles. If you'd like to see our provincial little old country club ... Maybe ask me out there to dance one evening. Alright. Goodnight, Andy. Goodnight Knowles. Bill. Goodnight. Oh, wait a minute. Your guns are all crooked. &lt;romantic music plays&gt; Andy, stop that. Stop it now, ya hear? Stop what? Whatever it is you're doing. I'm not doing anything. Whatever it is you're trying to do then, Mr. Smarty. Why won't you let me kiss you? Because I won't. Why? Because you're not sincere. That's why. I'm almost in love with you. Do you know that? No. I don't know anything of the kind as it so happens. If you ever let me kiss you, though, I would be. I know I would. I mean it. You do not mean it. That's just a perfect example of how insincere you are, Mr. Andrew McKenna. Why don't you try me? Just kiss me once and see if it's not true. Now, you stop this at once. Do you hear me? I am instructing you to introduce an entirely new line of conversation. You keep your hands to yourself. And you talk to me. Go on now. Go on. Well. There's something I am curious about. How come you haven't married one of the locals? I'm sure you could have anyone you want just by lifting your hand. Well. For one thing, I only turned 19 just a few weeks ago. That's not exactly the age of spinsterhood. And for another, I could never marry a Southern man. Why not? Oh, don't pretend you haven't noticed. They're so provincial, honey. I don't intend to spend the whole of my life in lil ole Tarleton. Or even in Georgia, for that matter. No, thank you. I happen to have set my sights a little higher than that. What are your requirements, Ailee? My requirements? What kind of man are you looking for? That'd be tellin'. Am I in the running? Oh. Now there you go being insincere again. Anyway. What makes think I was looking for anything special? The night we met. Remember? When I started to go ... Right there by the door, you straightened out my collar pin. And just for a minute there ... You looked at me in a certain way. What kind of way? Well, just for a second ... as if to say ... Are you the one? Are you the what? The one. Are you the one? Oh, poo. You did. I never. You did so. You made that whole thing up. I never looked at you in a special way. Says you. I was just being kind straightening out your lil ole guns. See what I get for my trouble. Insults. I oughtta walk straight into that house and just leave you sitting here. You do and I'll follow you. I happen to know your folks went to the vaudeville tonight. Well! Well, now. It just so happens I'm gonna accept that challenge. Come on. What?! You heard me. Come on. On your feet, soldier boy. Follow me. You mean it?! I never say anything about anything I don't mean. I hope you don't mind candlelight. Our great President Wilson has asked us to forego electricity. 4 nights a week so as to conserve fuel for next winter. I love candlelight. I'm gonna love you the very first time we kiss. You think that's why I asked you in here? isn't it? Follow along. There. Who's that? Who do you think? Your best beau? He was. Sure enough, always was. I hate him. Who is he? You do not hate him. Don't you ever say that. He's the man I measure every other man against. If I ever meet anybody like him ... It'll just take one look ... take off my dancing slippers and my flirtin' days'll be over for good. Just be him. Not men at all. Are you ever gonna tell me who he is? He's my brother. Oh. My brother Bobby. Bobby Joe Calhoun. Was your brother? He died. I'm sorry. It was during his senior year at Yale. He could've had his pick of any college in the whole South. But, he chose to go to New Haven on an athletic scholarship. He was on the track team. Varsity? Yes, varsity. Of course. He knew he had this infection in his chest. But he kept it a secret so he could run the 440 against Princeton. He couldn't let the team down. Did he win the race? What does that matter? He died. He is the noblest person I ever knew. The noblest and the most sincere. Sorry, old man. Look, old man, we just got here. For Pete's sake. It's our first dance. Come on, McKenna. Be a gentleman. I suggest you keep your own counsel, Lieutenant Canby. Go away now. Go away nicely. You can have a dance later on. Otherwise, I shall refuse to recognize you this whole evening long. Ailee. Go on now, shoo. That guy gives me the creeps. Oh, he's just a great big ole silly. He's always moping around. Yeah? Oh no. Oh, Captain. Hello, Andy. Got that little matter straightened out with our Supply Sergeant, did you? Uh. Yes. Yes, sir. I took care of it before I signed out this evening. Good, good. I've been admiring this young lady ever since you walked in. I wondered if you might not introduce us. Yes. Yes, of course. Ailee, this is Captain Haines. My ... um. Captain John Haynes. Jack. How do you do? Miss Ailee Calhoun. Would you do me the honor of dancing with me, Miss Calhoun? If Andy doesn't object. No, no. Of course not. Then by all means. (instrumental version of 'Hello Ma Baby' plays) Hayes is it? Haynes. Jack. I take you to be a Yale man. How could you know that? I'm a witch. Oh. Wait a minute, your guns are all crooked. Oh, you don't mind. Do you darling? No, no, certainly not. What right have I got to mind anyway? Right, you're not my beau, after all. Well, you're something much nicer. You're my friend. You're my confidante. That's right. Good ole Andy. Come over here and let me confide in you, honey. So I can whisper to you without being overheard. Don't look so grumpy. Lars Canby telephoned me a few minutes ago. I'm terribly upset by what he said. What'd he say? Don't ask me how. But somehow he got wind of Bill coming back here today. And he called me up to say ... No, it's too horrible. Tell me. He said that if I should decide to marry Bill Knowles ... He's gonna climb up 6000 feet in his little ole airplane and ... And what? And just shut off the motor and let go. He's crazy. I don't know what to do, Andy. He really frightened me. The best thing you can do is steer clear of him from now on. I never understood what you see in him anyway. What on earth makes you think I see anything in him? What exactly do you take me for? I can't hardly abide the man. I despise him. Then why the hell do you ... Andrew McKenna. Then why do you go out with him? I don't know. Because he's so sincere, I guess. He may be awful, but he is very sincere. &lt;ragtime waltz plays&gt; I'm sorry. But? May I? Now where has Bill got to? Come outside with me. Andy, I can't. Please, just for a minute. He'll find us. Well, I shouldn't. ('For Me And My Gal' plays) What's this now? It belongs to Tom Warren from my platoon. Get in. Are your intentions honorable, sir? No. Very well then. Andrew McKenna, you devil. What's the difference? I might be dead in a couple of months. You talk like that and I'm gettin' straight out of this car. I warned you. It's true. More than a million of us in France already. And they're dying by the hundreds every day. Read the papers. I don't read the papers. I don't even look at them. And I don't want to know about it. Gosh, you can't just walk around wearing blinders. Don't you tell me what I can do and what I can't do. There's no man alive has that privilege. So you just hush up. Hear? Give me that. Give me another. Look, you got me all upset. Just when I want to be most happy and gay. I think you're just annoyed with me for cutting in on you and Bill Knowles. Oh now, that is ridiculous. Do you wanna know the truth? I was more than a little surprised lots of people didn't cut in. They usually do. I mean ... Land's sakes. Do they think I'm already married? Are you going to be? I don't know. I'll tell you, Andy. Sometimes, when he treats me as if I were sacred, it thrills me. It's like this. Makes me feel all warm and liquidy. Ailee? I'm gonna kiss you. Please Ailee? Is that Ailee? Who's that? It's Don Cameron. Donald Cameron. You know, I can't believe you're here. You didn't once try to cut in on me while I was dancing. I suppose you going to tell me you just this minute climbed out of your little ole airplane. Ailee. Did you hear about this afternoon? What? Horace Canby crashed. He was killed instantly. You mean ... He was killed? Yes. They don't know what the trouble was. His motor just ... I don't know. Get Bill Knowles out here. Tell him she wants to go home. Andy. It's alright. Andy, he's dead. Try not to think about it. I don't know what to do. Here's Bill. Andy. You must never, never tell anybody what I told you about Canby this afternoon. What he said. I mean, what he threatened to do. Of course not. Oh, Andy. I heard all about it. It's gonna be all right. Bill is here. Just lean on me, Ailee. Ailie. You've just got to be very very brave. And try not to let it break your heart. Come on. There's a taxi over here. Goodnight, Andy. Goodnight. You poor fool. Oh Henry. That was all she said. But what she meant was ... Isn't it too curious for words that I have this disastrous effect on men? Of course, I should have made one of those fine moral decisions ... that people make in books and despised her. On the contrary. I don't doubt that she could still have had me. By raising her hand. Ailee! Ailee! Andy, just wait. I know. I'm late. I had trouble getting a lift from Ken. Andy, listen. Come on, get your hat. Now, you promised me a ruddy watermelon party. Now I'm rarin' for one. This just came from Bill. Bill? Bill Knowles. You do remember Bill Knowles. He just happened to introduce us. What about him? He's arriving this afternoon on the 1:00 train from El Paso. So? He's coming to see me, Andy. He's got a three day pass. And he's coming to spend all three days with me. I can't just go off and leave him in the lurch. I didn't know it was serious between you two. Well, who said it was serious? Well, is it serious? Well, I reckon you have to ask him that? All I know is he's coming. He'll be here in another hour. Well, that's just great. Night. Goodnight. ('For Me And My Gal' plays) A few days after Horace Canby's death after her performance outside the country club, Ailee made it alright by saying wistfully ... I know you think it wast terrible of me to think of myself at a time like that. I mean, I know his crash was an accident. But you have to admit. After what he said to me that very day, that's a shocking coincidence. I swear your silence speaks volumes, Andrew. I don't suppose I'll ever be able to convince you. Ailee Calhoun is wearing a one-piece bathing suit. I call that truly uncouth. My mama says nobody but a fallen woman would wear a one-piece suit in public. Well, if you ask me, it looks like nothing more nor less than a pair of her daddy's old BVD's cut down to size. Oh Kitty. Hush now. I believe Earl's getting ready to dive again. And he said this one's dedicated to me. Who's that? Who's what? On the diving board. I can't tell. He looks like a streetcar conductor. Oh. That's Earl Schoen. Earl Who? Schoen. S-C-H-O-E-N Schoen. What sort of a name is that? Don't ask me. He just came in from the Fourth. All their officers are up in the ranks. I mean, it's hard to tell if they come from any background at all. They all have weird names with no vowels in them. No vowels? No vowels at all? Just consonants. You mean like msgrts? &lt;continues to mispronounce words&gt; &lt;another nonsense word&gt; He really does look exactly like a streetcar conductor. I believe he's coming this way. Where's my transport? I just know he's come to collect my transport. I can't find it anywhere. Lordy, how embarrassing. Hi, Andy. Oh, hello. Earl, isn't it? Uh huh. Earl Schoen. svkrts How you like my girl? Your girl? Yeah, the one I was telling you about at camp. Remember? I said she's no Jane or anything like that. A real society girl. That's her over there. Lil brunette. The one in the shade. &lt;scoffs&gt; Real society girl. Kitty Preston. Black Hand Society. Who's this little lady? Ailee, I'd like you to meet Lieutenant Schoen. Monsieur LeCaron Hi Ailie. How do you do, Lieutenant? Call me Earl. Say, this is really swell. You and me with the two best looking girls in town. What do you say we all have dinner together down to the hotel some night? We'll talk about it. Good deal. Well. Back to the old grind. &lt;screams&gt; Well, well! What do you think of him? Well, he has already went back to the old grind. You like him? Like him? What is there to like? Well, he is good looking. Eggplant's good looking. Marzipan's good looking. I personally can't abide either one. Well, take a tip from your old friend and confidante. Don't go getting involved with Earl Schoen. He's no Yaley. No Harvard man, God knows. I just this minute said hello to the man and you've got me engaged to him already. Impossible. You're engaged to Bill Knowles, aren't you? Am I? You don't see any rings on this hand, do you? Did you promise to wait for him? I promised to write to him while he was overseas. I see. I'm hot. You going in the water? Soon as I'm done on this side. Hurry on then. Ya hear? Show off. Dunk me will ya? I'm gonna get you for that little lady. &lt;jaunty ragtime music plays&gt; It's dangerous to run. He won't stop following me. Might have him pay my car fare. Ailie Calhoun. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. I didn't think it of you to go out and deliberately try and take a man away from another girl. I thought you considered yourself above anything like that. If you care for him, you certainly oughtn't to blow yourself in front of him. Hey, that was fun. Listen. I'm not trying to beat Andy's time or anything. But, I 'd sure like to see you again. What about Saturday night? Busy. Sunday afternoon then. I'm busy. Then what about next week? I can give you a ring on the phone. I'm very busy at the Red Cross all this month. Bye. The Red Cross? That's a new one. I have to do my bit. Don't I? I can't spend all my time on the dance floor. I thought you handled Kitty Preston very neatly. She'll never hold that young man. He wants somebody new. Apparently, he wants Ailie Calhoun. Oh, charmer. He could give me his ticket punched away like a fraternity pin. What fun. If mother ever saw someone like that come into the house, she'd just lie down and die. Oh, I'll answer that. Yes, Miss Ailie. Hi. Come in. I'm not too early, am I? No. I walked around the block so I wouldn't be. Come on in the parlor. Do I look alright? Fine. Wait a minute. Your guns are all crooked. Mother. May I present Lieutenant Earl Schoen from New Bedford, Massachusetts. ('Poor Butterfly' plays) Men's room. Is he the one? Oh, I know what you think. I know he's just the biggest tough, but he's so sincere. Seems to me you must be the person who's looking for THE one, Andy. Didn't I see Ida and a number of pretty girls in there this evening? You can't them for that. Can you? It's the war. The war and all this youth. It seems like there never was so much love around. Everybody wants in on it. Everybody's looking all the time. It's just that the right people don't always see each other at exactly the same time. I swear. Scratch a cynic and all this romance comes gushing out. You're not romantic, of course. Me? It's the last dance. May I have the last dance, mame? Sir, you may. Oh, watch my purse, will ya hon. Lady Calhoun and that beau-hunk. Doesn't make sense. Oh, well. Granted, he's damn good looking, but my God, Andy, is he stupid. He's uneducated. He's practically a loser. I guess she knows what she's doing. I don't think so. Ailie's bright in a lot of ways. But, I think she's very naive about what we're like up north. She sees this clod in an officer's uniform, and I'm afraid she imagines that he's just like us. That he's some kind of gentleman. Look, she's only distracting herself with him. I hope you're right, because otherwise she's riding for an awful fall. Don't sit here brooding. Come and meet a couple of nice, uncomplicated girls. Clary Margaret and Stella Carol Happer. I'd like you to meet a fellow officer of mine, Andy McKenna. There's this boy who's going overseas any day now. Next Saturday may be our last day together til the war's over. I just got to have something really special to wear. Ailie Calhoun. I think you are plum crazy not to want the pink organdy. Well. Let me have another look in the back. Now, this here is one of my latest fall arrivals. Swan lace all hand-decorated. What's the matter? Who's that curious looking woman over yonder? Where? In front of the Tick Tock luncheonette. Oooooo, bad news. That's Loretta Levison. Do I know her? You wouldn't be likely to know her honey. She's nobody anybody like you is ever likely to know. She looks like nothing more nor less than some kind of painted ole harlot. Well, judge not lest we be judged. I reckon the good Lord had something in mind when he made women like Loretta Levison. One thing is, as long as these soldier boys got somebody like her to come to once in a while ... That means less demands are going to be made on the decent girls in this here town. Now, just you hold this. They're coming this way! I believe she's leading him in here. What's it bothering you, Ailie? I got to go. Isn't there another way out? Well, what about your new frock? I think she's sore about something that happened downtown. The butler says she said to tell me she's not home. I mean, it's a darn funny thing. After all, we made this date more than a week ago. Good evening, Oliver. Evening, Mr. McKenna. We're calling on Miss Calhoun. She and Lieutenant Schoen have an engagement this evening. Miss Ailie aint at home, Mr. McKenna. There, you see. Oliver, you tell Miss Ailie that I'm here and I want to speak to her alone. Well, I don't know how I'm gonna tell her when she ain't at home. What happened downtown, anyway? It was nothing. Just some dumb little incident. If ya ask me, it's pretty silly of her to carry on this. Miss Ailie say she don't want to see that other gentleman about nothing never. &lt;to Fitzgerald&gt; She said, come in you like. I'll wait in the car. But if she's not out in 5 minutes, we'll go without her. I can pick up another date on the way. You're a charming man, Schoen. 5 minutes. Mr. McKenna. Hello, Andy. Seems like I haven't seen you for ever so long. My company's been out on the rifle range all week. Has he gone? Now Ailie. Now Ailie. Now Ailie! He spoke to me as he ... He stood there not 10 feet from me with that ... That horrible woman. And when he saw me ... He raised his hat and he spoke to me. Ailie, it's our last night. Our company ships out for Camp Mills tomorrow morning. Earl did arrange for this little party in the officer's mess tonight. He went to quite a lot of trouble. Well, I can't help that. I never want to see Earl Schoen or ever hear him again. You sure? Completely sure. How can I ever trust him again after this? How could I ever believe in his sincerity? I wish I knew what you mean when you talk about people being sincere. Well, in this case, it makes no nevermind whatsoever. Because I have decided I am never gonna see that man again. Never, never in this world! Okay. Okay, good. You want my honest opinion? That's the best decision you could possibly make. I'll just tell him ... &lt;car horn honks&gt; Isn't he awful? &lt;car horn continues to honk&gt; Isn't he just terrible. Hurry up. Get your cape. (Taps plays) It's Andy's turn to make a toast. Andy. Andy. Well. I'd like to drink to the South. Hear, hear! To her friendliness, her hospitality ... her beauty ... And most of all to her beautiful ladies. To the ladies. Our detachment started for Camp But I didn't go to France after all. One cold morning, we marched aboard a transport with steel helmets slung at our sides. And then marched off again And there wasn't any more war. I had missed the war. This place is a ghost town, isn't it? How long you been waiting for your discharge? Since November. Since they shipped us back from Mills right after the armistice was signed. Really depressing. And all the local boys coming back now. I see 'em all over town. Some of 'em with crutches or an empty sleeve. Have you seen Ailie? I saw her last night. And? I told her I was on my way home. I asked her if she'd like to come up north next week and stay with my family. Meet my friends. Is she coming? She's waiting for somebody, but it isn't me. Honey! What's wrong? I know. It's the first time you ever saw me out of uniform, i'nnt? Well? What do you think? Nice to see a little color again i'nnt? After all that darn khacki. Notice the match? Look here. Purple socks. Hahahaha. And that's nothing. Wait'll you see what I got in there. Up home, I'm known as a pretty sharp dresser. With a pretty sharp eye for the ladies. Of which you little lady are the doggone number one. Well. Hello. Well, this is a surprise. Nice to see you. Hello, Andy. Still stuck in the old monkey, huh? When they gonna let you out anyway? Three more days. It was the lucky coincidence running into you. I got a new job up home. Really darb. Course it's only the tide us over 'til I can see some easy money. But the thing is, as soon as we're settled into a little apartment in New Bedford ... we're both like you to be one of the first people to come there and visit us. Well. That sounds really darb. I don't know what Ailie said or how much her grief weighed against her stupefaction. She acted quickly. Three days after his arrival, Earl and I went north together on the train. Well. That's the end of that. She's a wonderful girl. Too much of a high brow for me. And I guess she's got to marry some rich guy who's gonna give her a great social position or something. I can't see that stuck up sort of thing. Did you see who I saw gettin' on up ahead? What? Two wonderful looking Janes. All alone. There they are. Don't turn around. Let's say we mosey up there and invite 'em to lunch. I'll take the one in the flowery hat. Andy. There's one thing. How do you suppose she knew I used to work on a streetcar. I never told her that. Search me. (sings 'Claire De Lune') For 6 years, while I finished at Harvard Law and built commercial airplanes ... Ailie Calhoun was scarcely more than a name on a Christmas card. Something that blew a little in my mind on warm nights ... when I remember the magnolia flowers. ('Valencia' by Mario Lanza plays) Occasionally, an acquaintance of Army days would ask me ... What became of that blond girl that was so popular? But, I didn't know. Andy. Andy. You came back! You ole thing. You came back. I knew you would. Ailee. Oh, Ailee. Six years. Hush, this is Georgia honey. Don't you know we've got witchcraft down here? Make time stand still. You feel so good. You feel just the same. Do I look just the same? Better. Not so bad for an old hag of 25, hmm? Prettiest girl I ever knew. Well, it is certainly clear you haven't changed even one little bit, Mr. Andrew McKenna. How come? Still just as insincere as ever. Oh, Ailee. Now don't go getting all sentimental on me now. I'm still the belle of Tarleton, you know. I haven't retired my dancing slippers yet. Ailie Calhoun's gonna keep you hoppin' while you're down here, suga. You better know it. The watermelon parties and the barbecues still go on nonstop. And as for our little country club ... Well! ('I Want To Be Happy' plays) What'd I tell you, nothing's changed. Everything's changed. I don't know any of these people. I haven't seen a familiar face all evening. You gotta move with the times, darlin'. I suppose. &lt;lively jazz music continues to play&gt; Have you ever heard anything from Earl Schoen? No. I often think of him. He was ... Go on. I was gonna say, he was ... the man I love most, but ... that wouldn't be true. I ... I never exactly loved him, or I ... I would'a married him, any ole how. Wouldn't I? It was impossible. Of course. Oh, how the Yankees do deceive us poor lil Southern girls. What's happening? The last dance. There was a new generation on the dance floor. With less dignity than the ones I had known. But none of them were more a part of its lazy, feverish essence than Ailee. Yet somehow her wild animation, which even now called enough men around her to rival the youngest and freshest ... was itself an admission of defeat. Just where she had lost the battle waged behind the white pillars of her veranda, I don't know. But she had guessed wrong. Missed out somewhere. It was hours later, tossing about in my bed in the hotel, that I realized what was the matter. What had always been the matter. I was deeply and incurably in love with her. I told her so the next afternoon. I couldn't marry you. I don't love you that way at all. You don't love me. You know you don't. I didn't mean to tell you, but it so happens I'm going to be married next month. We're ... not even announcing it because we've already done that twice before. Who is he? A man from Savannah. You know I could never marry a northern man. Are you in love with him? Of course I am. Of course I am! What are you tryin' to make me say? Andy. What ever got into you? You devil. How could I possibly ever settle down with anyone that knows me as well as you do. I'm too vain for that, honey. I don't want to be understood. I wanna be worshiped. And you're afraid that nobody who's onto you could really love you, is that it? Onto me? What an expression. I mean, it has to be ... uncritical worship. Isn't that why you feel safe with men like Candy and Earl Schoen? Don't. But isn't that what you really mean by sincerity? Don't try to know me too well, Mr. Harvard graduate. My Southern pride won't allow that. I told you I was vain. I don't think you're all that vain, Ailee. Deep down somewhere, I think maybe you don't like yourself very much. And maybe in a lot of important ways, you tend to sell yourself short. What nonsense. Now you really are going too far. I'm only trying to say, that I think I have a better opinion of Ailee Calhoun than you do. Then keep it darling. I want you to think well of me. I want to know that always, forever and ever ... even if we never see each other again ... Wherever you are, you'll always remember me as somebody. What are you thinkin'? Thinkin' I'll be heading north tomorrow. So soon? Do you have to? I think it's best. Well then we must do something very special with what's left of the day. Yes. There is something I'd like to do. What's that? Ride up to camp. But there's nothing left there, honey. I don't care. Turn right when we get to the crossroads. No. Left. You won't find a single thing, Andrew. The contractors tore it all down. This the place? I'm not sure. It could be. If the company street ran along here, then my barracks would've been on the left. And the officer's mess where we had the party that last night, would've been over there. No way. Seems to me it was much farther on out than this. I'm not sure. Whatever are you looking for, darling? My youth. Your what? My youth. Can't hear ya, honey. Did I tell you they're going to fix up the old race cars? Tarleton gave hot doggie in his old age. &lt;voice of memory&gt; It's Andy's turn to make a toast. Andy. Andy. I'd like to drink to the South. Hear, hear. To her friendliness, her hospitality, her beauty ... And most of all, to her beautiful ladies. &lt;sad banjo plays&gt; Upon consideration, they didn't look like the right trees. All I could be sure of was this place that had once been so full of life and effort was gone. As if it had never existed. And in another month ... Ailiee would be gone. And the South would be empty for me forever. &lt;hears his daughter chatting with the man servant&gt; What's wrong, honey? You're looking at me like somebody you never expected to see again in this world. You stop it. You hear? You're making me feel downright spooky. I know they told us this old house was supposed to be haunted when we rented it. I never thought I'd turn out to be the ghost. You didn't just get rid of me in your story, did you? If I had known I was working that close to the nerve ... I would have recommended laughing gas. Nevermind. You've done that before. Lots of times. That's the best part of being a writer. Whenever things get too close to the way they are, you just change them to the way they should have been. Don't stay out here in the cold. You'll take a chill. Seems like no matter who you start out writing about, it always turns out to be about us. I reckon you think if you write the story often enough, maybe sometime, some way, it'll have a happy ending.
