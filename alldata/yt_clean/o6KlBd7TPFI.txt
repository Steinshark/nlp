Why is British English so much more sophisticated much less snobby than British English? Why is so much more elegant? Why on Earth would you Let's answer all those questions and more Welcome to another episode of &quot;Words author of etymology books including *Words from &quot;Useless Etymology.&quot; And I'm Rob Watts from we're talking about the differences You might have already noticed a difference at the accents of the hosts. Jess, explain where I'm in the US; specifically, I live in I've lived in Colorado, I'm and I spent 18 years growing up in Tennessee. diction and the words that I use every for everyone in the US because the range of And across what I would say is a smaller area, very broad. That's where I'm from, and I've I have to say. I've lived in London, Manchester, which is smack bang in the middle. It's I believe. And I speak British English; I a slight northernness in the way I speak. I collect some raspberries.&quot; I say, &quot;Please pass And so we get to the nub of what this episode the differences within our countries but common language&quot; is how George Bernard Shaw and the United States. And it's true, isn't but they are different--they're Indeed. We've got a transatlantic war of words I think the most obvious way in which the English manifests itself is in the vocab for example, that I would call a thing in top floor a &quot;lift.&quot; You would describe Indeed, that's an &quot;elevator.&quot; In fact, I would use the word &quot;apartment.&quot; Do you know No, I have no idea. It's from Old English. &quot;Flett&quot; was the a ground-floor dwelling, but it's meant to an area that's spread out that you live more sense because it literally means a But isn't anywhere that you live a place apart Well, ideally, but you could also have apartments rooms within your house. &quot;Flat,&quot; on the We're going to try and keep this civil, &quot;apartment&quot; is a better word. However I can't even count: &quot;flat,&quot; neat, four letters, beautiful. &quot;Lift&quot; as well, versus &quot;elevator.&quot; with, what, one, two, three, four You know, I do like &quot;lift&quot; a little bit dialectical purposes. Tell us about some What do you call a potato that has been Are you talking about delicious, delicious chips? I am talking about delicious, delicious French from around the same time, like within the same What Americans would call &quot;French fries,&quot; but what Two Cities,* interestingly enough. &quot;French fried because at the time, cooking potatoes by immersing cooking, whereas most other English-speaking What you've already debunked for me there is that First World War--pick any war--who were actually in these potatoes served in this specific fried and because they assumed they were French, but By the way, to me, a chip is thicker than Like what you get in America in McDonald's, I can imagine my dad calling them It's a French fry. It's distinctly different Yeah, that makes sense. For a thicker piece, Oh, yeah, but that's got to be, to me, there's waffle fries, tater tots--we've got every different names. But they usually all I did notice since 1769, thin slices of food, and not specifically fried, were also called you consider it on that front. But if you're just So, people watching this might be thinking, this difference between the words for chips people call potato chips)?&quot; But I have it did matter. To a 10-year-old me, it really in Orlando, Florida, hungry--so very hungry. And please. I'd love a plate of chips--some So, I went up to the booth to the man, please?&quot; And then he went over where he had them on the wall or in some Indeed. And so I thought, &quot;Oh no, I'm going and I thought, &quot;Oh, okay. I know it's something is it? What is it, what is it? Potato, potato chips. So I still ended Oh, that's unfortunate. One of my, um, favorite when nationalism periodically gets in the way of near the outset of the Iraq War, when France we tried &quot;Freedom fries&quot; for a little while. there was also a wave of &quot;American McDonald's-styled ones for a little while. We'll definitely get into the impact in particular a little bit later in this podcast. Oh yes, the whole &quot;war on language&quot; has Yes, it did. But also, just the very existence and its current written form, has a lot to do Let's talk about a few more of the differences. crisps trauma. There are a few other differences Such as? Yes. Do you know why I didn't rush Because I know it's going to make comments about the fact that I blush That's my favorite part, though. I'm doing it now. I'm actually doing it. Watch, we're about to start talking about fannies. my grandma fall off her chair if she heard me to you as it is to me. It's a different it's a word for your backside, whereas for you, Yeah, it's not mine. It's not every time I to Jess. I should point this out. It can be than I normally am at this point. Moving on, Wait, wait, wait. No, hang on, hang on. My it comes from, though. Do you know where No, I'm gonna make you sit through this one. likely. It may have come from a different more salacious double entendre term. But the Pleasure* was a 1748 novel that touched off some about obscenity and indecency in fiction. literary pornography in English. Its author, his publishers and printer for corrupting that our listeners and viewers go and look up You can find it on gutenberg.org or archive.org. It's very funny and involves lots of heaving Fanny Hill is a person's name or a place? It is a person's name. Good to know. And lucky Fanny Hill named after her. Now let's talk about that covers that part in question, when I say the word &quot;pants,&quot; I'm not talking Right, yes, yes, you are correct. You're correct to pants, I'd be referring to what I've got foot in your mouth, so to speak, with this one. that word, but it's more of a designation that we a trouser is a nice pair of business pants for it's underwear, it's panties, It's very exciting. We prefer not to talk about the unmentionables. Do you know the No, it must be from French, panton, somehow. are from the name of a character from Italian typically wore red hose or leggings, and all pants a silly, avaricious old man who tended to get into openly mocked him. So, I don't know that his pants but they were a feature of this character There you go. Another thing related there's a difference in what that means What does suspenders mean in British English? Suspenders are what hold up your socks. Okay, yes. So, a garter is what holds up your up your pants. But you also have another word We call them braces. That's right, which sounds like something Well, yeah, it could do, but it comes in handy. we might refer to it as a brace, as Mhm. Okay, okay, I've got one. If you're in. Go on. I'm, of course, I'm in. Okay. You probably have--my understanding and I want to know the distinction here. What do You're talking about a biscuit. I am perhaps talking about a biscuit, Right. Yeah, because a biscuit It is. It depends on where you live, but in most to what you would call a scone or a scone. I it is--that's another podcast in its own right. and a little fluffier. The ones I make for the buttery, fluffy pieces of bread that kind Right, but a biscuit and gravy in Britain would But the American word for what I would call a That's right. And I've heard some softer biscuit may be called a cookie Yes, those soft biscuits very and if it's got chocolate chips in Can I use this as a jumping-off point to talk side of the Atlantic for so many things? Because right? But it doesn't enter English in Britain it enters in America from the Dutch who are the Welsh, etc., who have settled over terms that entered English in the United I have no idea what a cruller is. Absolutely none. It's a variety of baked Dutch goods, yeah. And get from German, comes into English in the United that are happening, with all these people living English is different from British English in terms shared story of either trying to escape Europe for have Italian words that get used more in America A difference. We don't call What's a zucchini? Zucchini is a long green squash. They also come in yellow, but you don't Okay, we're talking about Yes, that is correct. It took me a while to one in the same family of foods, right? Again, too far into the plant world, but what I call No, I call it an aubergine, which actually neatly are differences between British English and right? These are people who've taken the whereas the Brits are kind of just resting on also, you know, the people who are in America they're having to come up with names for things. they take a Native American name for a thing, they see a raccoon and end up calling words. They take a word that some other like a prairie or a bayou or a levee--you so we don't have native words for them--or they Eggplant is one of those, and small white eggplants that actually are in the same family and have the Yeah, if you've never seen an eggplant Google it immediately. It's going to I only realized it very recently. But bullfrog English words and putting them together to By the way, you mentioned raccoon. I love the it comes from literally means &quot;he scratches with with other words for raccoons around the world. bear,&quot; which also references the fact that they Yeah, I'm here in Germany, and it is it might surprise you to know we do have them in Berlin. I was out running the other Are they the same color as they're Yeah, they're an invasive species. They're Dear trash pandas. And speaking of trash, we followers about this too, because I wanted differences since it does vary a little bit. and they have specific instances, but you Yeah, so we talk about rubbish. That's the stuff that you put in your bin and litter as well, which we use--I think that you do more. Litter is generally stuff that is littering You put stuff in it. You wouldn't talk about a No, litter is only when it's on the ground and can be anywhere, but the trash bag and One distinction that I was talking with use &quot;garbage person&quot; as the municipal but you would not call them a &quot;trash person&quot; It's not terribly nice, is it? While here's an interesting one. So what Right. But my post is delivered by the Royal Mail, and And we drop it off at the post office. Oh, you do? You call it a post office in a mailbox, whereas we put it in a postbox. That's right. Mhm. And we have phone boxes, Right. These days, not many, but Sometimes we have the same pronunciation of a about that a little bit. One of the most iconic I think, is the fact that you spell words and &quot;flavour&quot; with a &quot;u,&quot; and there is no Yeah, that's right, and that is almost Noah Webster in his American Dictionary, where of other linguists--he didn't do it on his own, America with its own version of the English Yeah, and &quot;color&quot; was one of them. But to say that it's wrong would obviously be nonsense It seems like a vestigial &quot;eurs&quot; on Well, weirdly, by taking away inadvertently come closer to Absolutely, and that also happens -yse (y-s-e) versus -ise (i-s-e) or &quot;analyse&quot; and &quot;paralyze&quot; versus &quot;paralyse&quot; Yeah, I've got a list here of differences, the -ize ones are a big one. We've also got a lot don't bother with. For example, if I were to write I would put two &quot;g&quot;s in &quot;waggon.&quot; You put two &quot;g&quot;s in &quot;wagon&quot;? Two &quot;g&quot;s in &quot;wagon.&quot; I used to drink in a pub in New York called The Waggon and Huh, no kidding. But also, like in the should have two &quot;l&quot;s in &quot;unravelled,&quot; &quot;l&quot; on &quot;travelled&quot; and &quot;traveller&quot; and it would look like it should take Yeah, you don't want to be talking Right, it gets a little mucked up. But thing? It seems like it's a little arbitrary. which has the &quot;u,&quot; and British English anymore. I wonder if maybe the reign of terror put No one's pretending that English spelling is spelling, particularly when it comes to vowels. Vowel Shift and the fact that the spellings points during the vowel shift, meaning that they also, there were loads of different spellings &quot;color&quot; c-o-o-l-o-r at one point. Of course, it with just about any constellation of vowels on one. And we've gone for one rule with the word The US has the &quot;our&quot; ending on at least one to the association with French fashion. In has also been through a change. There are quite between how British English and American English for example, and there's no consistency, to the French pronunciation. To me, it seems pronounce what I would say as &quot;niche&quot; This is interesting because I ran into I have found more American English speakers growing up, I heard &quot;nitch&quot; more often, but whereas &quot;clique&quot; has always been You know, I can just about put up with &quot;click.&quot; like that that end with &quot;que,&quot; and you don't, those. I don't know why, but it just does. But that &quot;e&quot; at the end, seems--yeah, that It does, it does. I'm not huge started saying &quot;niche&quot; because I more often if you try to say &quot;nitch.&quot; And do you think, oh well, maybe the class system, and us occasionally applying French pronunciations? But here's Yeah, that is interesting. I say &quot;valet.&quot; Yeah, and in Britain, and in British and one more thing. We've talked about which it's not pronounced like that in England. right? Because I thought it seemed weird, and saying, &quot;And this is how we pronounce this: pronunciation. I mean, &quot;lerie&quot; is way off. It has would make more sense, but I don't know that I'm One of my favorite examples of the spelling of the word &quot;jail,&quot; That is nonsense. Declare it nonsense. and I've definitely never written &quot;gaol&quot; That's good to know, but neither of superiority here because it's originally &quot;little cage,&quot; and it's just all kinds says that the legal style guides basically Oh, okay, so they're basically Right, you know, there is a pervading idea, I are modern innovations that have been made up speaking and such. You know, a diversion from the we shouldn't be using words like &quot;oftentimes&quot; the word &quot;sometimes.&quot; But &quot;oftentimes&quot; is a good lot of the time, or indeed &quot;oftentimes,&quot; doing quote marks with my fingers here--these if not older, than the term &quot;Oftentimes,&quot; by the way--yeah, I was one of those who thought it was but it turns out it's not. &quot;Oftentimes&quot; has been used. But also things like &quot;diaper,&quot; England would call a &quot;nappy&quot;--you know, Why did I say it the coarse way. I love it. Please keep it. [Laughter] &quot;Diaper&quot; is an older word. Also, preference for &quot;tidbit&quot; over &quot;titbit,&quot; that Titbit? We say &quot;titbit&quot; in I guess it's like a &quot;titmouse,&quot; which Yeah, for sure. Look how red I am. Anyway, Americans don't like to say &quot;titbit&quot; which makes sense when you think about the because they felt that England was--well, and so they needed to get over there and Um, but anyway, no, &quot;tidbit&quot; has been around it's newfangled and an abomination against the &quot;gotten&quot;--both of these things that British English off as Americanisms. You know, they're really not. There are also Americanisms that are I think, in a reactive way to what is perceived you see in British English. One of my favorite of cross-pollinated by both British and of poke fun at the way Americans speak, or Americans speak. That's the words that belong This is a category of verbs that were coined playwrights often, who were making a like Latin-sounding words and then nonsense &quot;discombobulate&quot; to make these sort of funny, the mouths of American characters, There are different variations like abruptly or run away. It adds the &quot;ab&quot; prefix &quot;sit&quot; or &quot;stay,&quot; so you're literally running away. and &quot;orate.&quot; Another one is &quot;obflisticate,&quot; of &quot;obfuscate.&quot; So we're doing a little swaggery of &quot;fluster&quot; and &quot;frustrate,&quot; and &quot;scrumplicate&quot; means But it is fair to say that there is a very America to create a different language and to Britain. Here, I want to bring in a quote American English dictionary, because this is &quot;As an independent nation, our honor requires us as government. Great Britain, whose children for the taste of her writers is already Ow! Oh boy, that's--goodness gracious. There were back in the day too, though he was a little one quote from him during the period when there especially like German, during the early 1900s. boarding house. There can be but one loyalty to American, and therefore only one language&quot; But the Brits did kind of give as good as sort of American approach to life, not just the most influential early English dictionary, said--he quoted a saying of Americans--"Sir, be thankful for anything we allow them short of It's harsh. He's not talking specifically about did exist and did drive American English away I mean, American English has also provided plenty because, you know, we've been around for a few &quot;billionaire,&quot; things like that, &quot;gubernatorial&quot; lot of American English words tend to seem like or they're just related to sugar. So, to hustle or American take on that word, swindling, gouging words like &quot;cupcake&quot; and &quot;diner&quot; as a word for Yeah, and also the turning of nouns into verbs. &quot;to interview someone,&quot; &quot;to divorce We sometimes say &quot;to holiday somewhere&quot; we didn't like it anyway. Hey, here's a we take completely for granted in British as a horrible American import. I was looking the Manchester Guardian as it was known, back in One of them is &quot;teenager,&quot; another one is &quot;to Interesting. Yeah, what's the alternative to that one? They would want you to there is a noble Shakespearean tradition Yeah, well, exactly. But resistance to this sort tide, right? It's always trying to prevent the ever managed to prevent with the English language. constructions as well that this style guiding that on board. For example, one of the ones listed you should have the aim of doing something. And instead, you should help them to finish the Yeah, yeah, yeah, you need that infinitive Other ones that it rules out as well are &quot;to Americanism. It does sound kind of cool orate but anyway, all of these are in this style probably find British people using every We have so much more material to cover time or in a future episode we can dig into local to where we've lived, because I Yeah, we have been so general so far, dialects within Britain and within the United different ways you can refer to just a small I'm going to see how many I can come up for watching or listening to another episode of Do leave your comments, leave your observations wordsunravelledpod@gmail.com.
