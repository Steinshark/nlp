Sorry, you're not weird. I'm Huh? (Timulus screams) - [OverSimplified] The Roman since its foundation, all the way down the Italian peninsula. But this isn't the famous Roman Empire that ruled the known world. Not yet, anyway. This is a relatively juvenile Rome, (Rome passes gas) In 264 BC, the big daddy of was Carthage. Let's rewind a bit. Carthage was founded in 814 had mega surplus of goods and across the Mediterranean. They became the dominant and to support their the Phoenicians established one of which was Carthage. Therefore, Carthage began its life as a Phoenician trade colony and the Carthaginians or, if you're a Latin speaking hence the name of the video. - Oh! Carthage gradually expanded and became the region's base of power. Just like Rome, Carthage was with its own Senate and Judiciary. But there were also some between the two. While Rome was big into in the neck, the Carthaginians, just like their Phoenician forefathers, had built their power through trade and navigating the waves. They went here and there, gold, and slaves. And as a result, they were rolling in it. Whenever they weren't busy swimming around in their copious hoards of they also possibly enjoyed to Ba'al, the God of, let ah, yes, plant fertility. - [Farmer] Oh boy, these Maybe if I throw my son they'll grow. - [Son] Have you tried watering them, Dad? - [Farmer] Hmm. No, we'll try that second. - [OverSimplified] As a Carthage had emerged as one of the Mediterranean superpowers. &quot;But wait,&quot; they said. &quot;Rome? What the heck is that?&quot; Well, I know it's a pretty that you've probably never heard of, but this spunky young nation was about to upset the entire Initially, the two sites enjoyed relatively friendly relations and it even signed a couple treaties. But it was a relationship to turn sour. See, Rome had a thing where they liked to aggressively expand their boundaries, often viewing such expansion Kind of like when you because you knew eventually to kill you first. Meanwhile, Carthage was of its wealthy trade network. So if you put a very between them, well, two Tensions rose and the two with increasing disdain. The hardworking Romans at the money-hungry &quot;Look at those dishonest crooks. Bet they've never done an honest And the Carthaginians &quot;Look at those simple-minded brutes. Bet they've never sacrificed &quot;Yeah!&quot; While war between the two the event that finally triggered The whole thing began on a wild night out. These mad lads are called the Mamertines. They were Italian mercenaries employed by the tyrant of Syracuse, here. But when he died, his successor said, &quot;Sorry, fellas, we don't with sharp sticks anymore. You can all go home.&quot; - [Mamertines] Aw. - [OverSimplified] The didn't want to go home. So instead, they went to and said, &quot;Hey man, we are without a home. May we come in?&quot; - [Guard] Aw, poor fellas. Sure thing! Ah, ah, just so long as you promise not to massacre all of us. - [Mamertines] (laugh) We promise! - [OverSimplified] The Mamertines then massacred all of them. Well, not all of them, just the men. And they stole their homes and families. - [Mamertine] Ha, this is my house now! This is my Best Dad Ever mug now! And you guys are my new family! Son, wanna go play catch - [Son] You're not my real dad! - [Mamertine] Ugh, - [Woman] You're not my real husband. - [Mamertine] Ugh, I'm so - [Woman] Then get out! - [Mamertine] No. - [OverSimplified] by the Mamertines and they began raiding up and down the Syracuse coastline. When the new ruler of Syracuse The Syracusans began fighting the Mamertines said, &quot;Oh, What do we do?&quot; - [Mamertine] Quick, we'll to come and save us. Oh no! We're in trouble! And we need a big, strong empire to come and rub our bellies. - [Mamertine Leader] Why - [Mamertine] If I was I think I'd like to be seduced. (Carthaginians murmur) See, it's working! - [OverSimplified] The of controlling all of Sicily. They had been fighting Syracuse on the island for centuries and now here was a great opportunity to get one over on them. So Carthage promptly answered and sent a force to garrison Messana. As it turned out, however, of the Mamertines weren't too happy with the occupying Carthaginians and they sent out a second When it reached the Roman Senate, they were a little more hesitant. Going to help the Mamertines ran the risk of triggering an all-out war with Carthage and they had only just finished conquering the Italian peninsula, so they were kind of tired. Plus the Mamertines were all They had never made a So you would assume that with Carthage, the exhausted Romans would probably sit this one out, But you would assume wrong. Rome just couldn't resist Well, there's something you See, as a Republic, they were hell-bent on preventing any one man from And so rather than having one leader, Rome had two, called These Consuls could also only before new Consuls were elected. These measures, to limit were noble, but had an The Consuls knew they had just one year to try and gain as much glory something that was very And the best way of Military victory, of course. The Roman political encouraging these Consuls to as your Italian grandmother when you don't eat all the spaghett. And so the glory-seeking to vote in favor of going to Messana. And in they went. Upon the arrival of the Romans, the Carthaginians in the were forced to leave. Now in contrast to Roman aggression, the Carthaginian military had a slightly different philosophy. - [Teacher] All right, kids, listen up. If you wanna grow up to be there's a few things If you fail to succeed on the battlefield, that's a crucifixion. Showing cowardice, that's a crucifixion. - [Warrior] Hello, sir. - [Teacher] Huh? What are you doing here? Aren't you meant to be in Messana? - [Warrior] Yeah, but - [Teacher] So you just left? - [Warrior] Sure did. - [Teacher] Oh, you better (class cheers) - [OverSimplified] The for victory and therefore tended to be aggressive go-getters. By contrast, the Carthaginian generals were brutally punished for failure and so they tended to be This dynamic is helpful of the crazy things that So the Romans have crossed over to Messana and now there was some red on the island. Hit that panic button. (crowd screams) This turn of events was unacceptable to both Carthage and Syracuse. So the traditional enemies teamed up to kick the Romans off their island. They surrounded the city and said, &quot;Hey, you jerks, this isn't your island! Come out of there at once!&quot; - [Romans] Okay, we're coming! - [Carthaginian] See, Phil. You just gotta speak with authority. That's what being an - [Romans] Hey man. - [Carthaginian] Oh, you No, I didn't mean. Oh, crap. - [OverSimplified] Out to engage the Carthaginians in battle and they sent them packing. With the battle of Messana, by going to help the Mamertines, the two sides had just With the initial Roman including Syracuse began Because being a winner is more fun. But the Carthaginians weren't about to just give up that easily. In 262 BC, they began at Agrigentum. So the Romans, being aggressively go got them. The Romans immediately laid siege, hoping to starve out the However, because this had been fighting outside across the water, they struggled And before long, the Romans were as starving as the Carthaginians They had to forage for food, And when Carthaginian creating a double siege, Everybody starved each other for months until nobody could take it anymore and they all finally came out - [War Counselor] Here's the report from the recent siege at Agrigentum, sir. - [Senate Member] We killed 30,000 while only suffering 7,000 losses? That's amazing! We're the best! - [War Counselor] Yes, sir. Whoops, those are the wrong way around. - [Senate Member] What? We lost 30,000? We're the worst! But we won, right? - [War Counselor] Yes, sir. - [Senate Member] But we - [War Counselor] Yes, sir. - [Senate Member] So are - [War Counselor] Yes, sir. (Senate murmurs) - [OverSimplified] The because they were aggressive go-getters and they now began of conquering the entire island. But they also suffered very heavy losses and it was clear they if they couldn't supply their troops. Here's the issue. Sicily was an island. Islands are surrounded by water. A strong navy would be and winning the war. Here was Carthage's navy (water splashes) can see the problem. Historians debate just how had at this point. Presumably, they must have had something to defend their shoreline. But whatever it was, it to the Carthaginian juggernaut. And so Rome had to figure about all this water. - [Roman General] Come on, men! We're not gonna let some pansy, candy-ass water get in the way of our glorious victory against Carthage! Charge! (Roman General sputters) Tell my kids I love them! - [Roman Leader] We're - [Roman Warrior] What's a boat? - [Roman Leader] I don't know. - [OverSimplified] If the and obtain Sicily, there was - [Roman General] I guess to go ahead and build ourselves - [Hank] From scratch? - [Roman General] From scratch. - [Hank] But we don't even know how, never mind how to fight with one. - [Roman General] Don't worry, Hank. We're up to the challenge. Come on, guys. We're Romans and Romans aren't - [OverSimplified] And so the trying to figure out how the latest style of warship. In the end, they had a A Carthaginian quinquireme ended up accidentally grounding on Italian soil. The Romans found it and copied the design. While the new fleet was being built, the Romans trained rowers on the Romans put together of 120 warships in just two Now, I know what you're thinking. &quot;But OverSimplified, if the from scratch in two months, then why does it take you Well, my valued subscriber, - [Carthaginian General] What the heck? How on earth did the Romans This shouldn't be happening! - [Carl] From what I hear, they copied the design from us, sir. - [Carthaginian General] did they get the blueprint, Carl? - [Carl] I don't know, sir. But I'll tell you what. If you're worried about - [Carthaginian General] No. - [Carl] And you wanna protect yourself from outside threats-- - [Carthaginian General] Don't you dare! - [Carl] Then you, my friend-- - [Carthaginian General] I'll scream! - Should use NordVPN! - [OverSimplified] Do knowing everything about you to advertisers who convince you in an endless cycle over Me neither!

Now, where were we? Oh yeah, the siege at and building a war fleet. So now the Romans have to put it to the test. But how does one wage Easy! All of the ships had giant so all you had to do was and give them the jimmies. Easy as pie. And so the aggressive Romans set out for some good old fashioned jimmy-giving. The Consul Gnaeus Cornelius of Lipara, believing the to join the Romans. As he entered the harbor, by a Carthaginian fleet and, he was completely outmatched. The Romans may have had a brand new fleet, but when it came to their inexperience showed. There was just something better about the Carthaginian ships. The Carthaginian rowers had nicer abs. The entire Carthaginian on expert seamanship. So when it came to water, and the Romans were wetter. In their initial skirmish, the that the Consul, Scipio, And if you're wondering what (donkey hee-haws) So what were the Romans to do? How could they possibly stand up to this Carthaginian superpower? Well, there's something about the Romans. Back when they found and copied its design, that Copying their enemies was as by sewing them into a leather and rooster and then which is a thing they did. Wait, what was I talking about? Oh yeah, copying their enemies. Many of the most famous Roman inventions were actually borrowed. Aqueducts, chariot racing, their gods. Even in warfare, the by a Sabine javelin and They'd get hacked to and they'd be like, &quot;Wow!&quot; And they'd copy the However, they wouldn't just copy it. They would advance it, as perfectly as possible. And in the case of naval if they wanted to beat the they would have to adapt. The Romans excelled at &quot;But what if,&quot; they turn a sea battle into a land battle?&quot; Sounds crazy, right? Well, they made a couple of tweaks to their warship and-- - [Carthaginian General] They must love getting their asses kicked! - [Carthaginian] Uh, sir, sticking out of their ships? - [Carthaginian General] Look at that thing! That'll I mean, look at... (laughs) Bob, get your camera out! (laughs) Take a picture of it. I mean, how stupid can you be? Let's just add a big that'll weigh us down and I mean, what does that thing even do? (ship crunches) (men yell) - [OverSimplified] The Romans had built a big swinging spiked So when the Carthaginian the Romans would just slam them. The Carthaginians tried The Corvus could swivel. Try going behind, the Romans It was foolproof. Those big sexy Carthaginian rowing muscles could flex all they want, for the Roman mind. So ladies, you see? What really matters is Please go out with me. And with that, the Romans, began dabbling in the art of naval combat, thanks to their ingenious to outclass the Mediterranean The Carthaginians were stunned. And the general in charge of the defeated Carthaginian fleet? Well, you better believe (kids cheer) With their newfound control of the seas, the Romans could now more and supply their legions on land. Surely the Romans were now free to unleash their aggression - [Roman General] Haha! Hey Carthaginians! What are you gonna do now that we're free to rampage across the island? - [Carthaginian General] We're and close this gate. - [Roman General] Oh, come on guys. Stop messing around. Come - [Carthaginian General] No. - [Roman General] Oh, come on! - [Carthaginian General] No. - [Roman General] Oh no! - [OverSimplified] To counter the Carthaginians decided to engage in a defensive war of attrition, forcing the Romans to engage The war in Sicily became a One by one, cities slowly fell Occasionally, the Carthaginians countered and even pushed them back, only for the Romans to rebound again. And whenever a city did finally fall, the Romans could delight in slaughtering the entire population and selling any survivors into slavery, which was pretty standard In general, the campaign on than the Romans had hoped. And quite frankly, they So in 256 BC, they decided - [Marcus] Hey everyone, my and I'll be one of your Look as I'm sure you all know, Sicily's being a bit of a drag. Sure, I could go and spend besieging one single city, a naked statue of me for that. So here's the new plan. I'm gonna skip Sicily and go right for the I'll slaughter the men, enslave and when I return, you'll all build 1,000 naked statues of me. (crowd cheers) - [Jim] Marcus, that That seems pretty evil and barbaric. - [Marcus] No, Jim, it's perfectly normal in the ancient world. Sometimes we even chop their pets in half. (crowd cheers) - [Carthaginian General] Okay are coming straight for us this time. And what will they do when they get here? They'll kill us all. (crowd gasps) They'll massacre each They may even chop our pets in half. - [Rob] That's barbaric! - [Carthaginian General] No, Rob, it's actually pretty normal for the time. We'd do the same to them. - [Mary] Who will protect us? - [Carthaginian General] That's kind of why I called this meeting. Who will protect us? Protect our families, You guys? Ha, don't make me laugh. Why, you're just a bunch Simple-minded buffoons, cowards, fools. Rob here thinks enslaving You're a snowflake, Rob. Yes, you are. The fact is if the Romans we're all gonna die a terrifying, hideous, unspeakably painful death. - [Rob] Is that the end of that speech? - [Carthaginian General] Yes. (crowd screams) - [OverSimplified] The from ever landing in Africa that would be the end. So as the Romans were the size of which the world the Carthaginians were to stop them. And in 256 BC, as the Roman invasion fleet made its way south, the stage was set for a humongous battle around 300,000 men, fighting to decide the course of the war. To this day, the Battle of Cape Ecnomus remains possibly the largest all the way back in ancient times. So the next time your granddad tells you about the time he sank a kick him in the nuts. The Romans had a lot They weren't just sending their warships, but transports as well, for their invasion of Africa. They therefore formed a to punch through the long, The Carthaginian generals, to prevent the Romans had a plan of their own. As the Roman fleet approached, feigned a retreat luring the Romans in so their outstretched and get around the Roman But with such a huge battle and so many ships crowded together, the Carthaginians struggled and in the chaos, three across the huge battle space. With the number of ships limiting the Carthaginians became sitting ducks and all the Romans had The Roman center came out to turn around and rescue The battle of Cape Ecnomus (epic music)
