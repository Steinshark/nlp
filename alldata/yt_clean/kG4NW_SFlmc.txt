This expression is really mostly highly used. Okay? I say it every time. Today for five weeks I'm going to teach you the must-know Korean expressions. And today we're going to do 20 expressions. So these 20 expressions are really important when you meet someone, when you meet the first, when you say, 'Yeah,' when you say, 'No, maybe'. And that's the expression that I want to teach you today. So let's start the 20 expressions today, okay? 20 expressions. Let's start. Okay. So the first expression is when you say, when you meet someone, you say, 'Hello.' Right? It's 'An-nyeong-ha-se-yo.' It's 'An-nyeong-ha-se-yo.' So it's like this way. So when you say, 'An-nyeong-ha-se-yo,' your body expression is really important. You can, if you just say like, 'An-nyeong-ha-se-yo,' it's not really, is not really right. You have to say, 'An-nyeong-ha-se-yo,' like this way. So you have to bow a little bit. You don't have to do like this way. It's not. So just like, do this. It's right, okay? So a little bit of, 'An-nyeong-ha-se-yo', okay? So this is the formal way of saying hello. So to your professor and to your mom and to the teacher and to the first, when you meet first, and you can say, 'An-nyeong-ha-se-yo.' OK? And there is also informal way. Informal way is, 'An-nyeong!' I'm going to show you that. The second expression is goodbye. It's goodbye. So when you say goodbye and to the teacher, and to the professor, you have to say, 'An-nyeong-hi-ga-se-yo.' So you have to do the bow to again. So 'An-nyeong-hi-ga-se-yo,' 'gada' is 'go.' So safely go, like, peacefully go, so it's not 'An-nyeong-hi-ga-se-yo.' It's 'An-nyeong-hi-ga-se-yo,' like this way. Okay? You have to bow. And when you say to your friends, it's informal way. Right? It's like this. So some people say, 'An-nyeong,' just with saying. But I would prefer 'An-nyeong.' It's more saying like 'An-nyeong,' like this way. I love this part. Like this way, okay? So, An-nyeong. And the fourth expression is when you say, 'Thank you.' 'Thank you' is 'Gam-sa-ham-ni-da.' So when you say, 'Thank you', it's also formal. So formal way of saying, you have to do this. 'Gam-sa-ham-ni-da,' also. But it's, you can say only, 'Gam-sa-ham-ni-da,' and you can do, 'Gam-sa-ham-ni-da', also. Okay? So when you go to the supermarket and she gave you the plastic bag and you can say, 'Gam-sa-ham-ni-da,' like this. And when someone, when you lost, and then you can say, 'Gam-sa-ham-ni-da,' too. Right? So you can say, 'Thank you.' So you can say, 'Gam-sa-ham-ni-da,' also. Okay? And there is also informal way of 'Gam-sa-ham-ni-da.' It's 'Go-ma-wo.' So between friends, you can say, 'Go-ma-wo.' You can say, 'Go-ma-wo.' So your friend helped you. Your friend helped you and then you can say, 'Go-ma-wo.' Jin-jja, really thank you. It's 'Go-ma-wo.' Okay? So this is the five expression. Let's repeat all together. Let's repeat. It's live. So we should practice together. Okay? So the first one. Let's listen and repeat. So you can do. And second. When you say, 'Good bye,' and 'An-nyeong-hi-ga-se-yo.' And to your friends. Three. To your friends. And the fourth expression is, 'Thank you,' in formal way. So, 'Gam-sa-ham-ni-da.' Okay? And number five. To your friends, 'Thank you' is 'Go-ma-wo.' So we're friends, right? So you can say to me, 'Go-ma-wo.' Okay? And let's go to the 6th expression. It's, 'How are you?' How are you? What's up? So when you see your friends, like a week ago and then you just met and then like, 'Eo-ddeo-ke-ji-nae-yo?' But 'yo' is a formal way. So when you say to your friends, 'Eo-ddeo-ke-ji-nae?' You can say that. What's up? How are you? And then when you say the answer, 'I'm doing good.' 'I'm doing good,' is this one. It's 'Jal-ji-nae-yo.' 'Jal' is well. Well, 'Ji-nae-da' is doing. So, well-doing. So you can say, 'Jeo-nun', I am doing well. So I can say, 'Eo-ddeo-ke-ji-nae?' And you can say, 'Jal-ji-nae-yo.' You can say that. Okay? So it's a very good conversation. Okay. And the next expression is... 'Nice to meet you,' in Korean is 'Man-na-seo ban-ga-wo-yo.' So 'Man-na-seo' is 'meet,' 'ban-ga-wo-yo,' 'nice.' So 'Man-na-seo', meet, and nice. And as I told you, 'yo' is a formal way. So when you say to your friend, 'Man-na-seo ban-ga-wo.' That's it, okay? Don't say 'yo' to your friends. So for us, we're just friends. And then you can say, 'Man-na-seo ban-ga-wo.' Nice to meet you. And the next expression is 'O-laen-man-i-eyo.' It's been a long time. Oh my god. It's been a long time. You can say, 'O-laen-man-i-eyo.' 'O-lae' is long. So, 'O-laen-man-i-eyo,' it's a long time. You can say that, okay? And the next expression is 'See you again.' 'Let's see you again,' is 'Ddo-man-na-yo.' 'Ddo' is again. So 'man-na-yo' is 'meet.' Right? So 'Ddo-man-na-yo.' 'Woo-ri' is 'we.' 'Ddo-man-na-yo,' is 'See you again.' Okay? So... So, for example. When I go to the blind date and I really liked the boy, I really like him and then I wanted to meet him again. And then you can say, 'Woo-ri, ddo-man-na-yo.' Let's meet again. Okay? Okidoki. So I'm going to repeat from six to ten. Okay? It's live. Let's practice together. The six one. How are you? What's up? And to your friend, delete 'yo.' OK? So you can say... And then, I'm doing well. And to your friend. And the next one is, 'Nice to meet you.' 'Nice to meet you,' is 'Man-na-seo ban-ga-wo-yo.' Let's repeat. Okidoki. And the next one is 'It's been a long time.' Oh my god. OK? And sometimes in friends, we don't say, 'O-laen-man-i-eyo.' We just say, 'Ya.' Between friends, you can say 'ya.' We just say that. Long time! Like this. OK? And the next one, the last one is 'See you again.' 'Ddo,' again. And when you say to your friends, like this. OK? For us. Next week. Let's, 'Ddo-man-na.' OK? Okidoki. So we finished the 10 expressions. That's amazing. OK? That's really amazing. So let's go to 11 to 15. It's really, in 11, 15, let's go. You're doing so well. The next expression is, 'I'm sorry.' It's 'Joe-song-ham-ni-da.' So seeing to 'Gam-sa-ham-ni-da,' it's 'Thank you.' And 'Joe-song-ham-nida,' has to do this. It feels more sorry. OK? So when you break something, in the supermarket, you accidentally broke something and then like, 'Joe-song-ham-ni-da.' You can say that. I'm so sorry. OK? So sorry. And then when you say to your friends, it's a little bit different. It's 'Mi-an-hae.' So, it's 'Sorry.' Sorry. Between friends. Like this. OK? So 'Joe-song-ham-ni-da,' is formal. 'Mi-an-hae', it's for friends, informal. OK? And the next one, it's okay. It's okay. In Korean, it's 'Gwaen-cha-na-yo.' It's okay. So, 'Gwae-cha-na-yo.' So when they say, I broke something. And then the supermarket say, 'Gwae-cha-na-yo.' Like this. OK? So, this is 'Sorry,' and 'It's okay.' And let's say, 'Good morning.' 'Good morning' in Korean is 'Jo-eun a-chim.' 'Jo-eun' is 'good.' And 'a-chim' is 'morning.' So good morning. So you can say, 'Everyone. Jo-eun a-chim.' Like this. It's really cheerful. Right? And then it becomes night. It's time to sleep. And what can you say? It's, 'Good sleep.' Right? 'Good night.' And 'Good night,' in Korean is 'Jal ja-yo.' 'Jal' is 'well.' So 'jayo' is 'sleep.' So well sleep. And it's formal because there's 'yo,' right? But when you say to your friends in informal way, you delete what? 'Yo.' Right. So you have to say, 'Jal ja.' OK? So you can say 'Jal ja,' to your friends. Let's do 'Jal ja,' when I finish the live streaming I will say, 'Jal ja.' So remember this. OK? Good night. Good sleep. OK. Let's review from the top. I'm sorry. There's a formal way and informal way. Formal way is, 'Joe-song-ham-ni-da.' But in informal way. And when you say, 'It's okay,' and then you can say 'Gwaen-cha-na-yo.' OK? And the next one is, 'Good morning.' You have to say cheerful. OK? Everyone. Tomorrow we'll have 'Jo-eun a-chim.' Because it's Sunday. And when you say, 'Good sleep. Good night,' you can say, 'Jal ja-yo.' OK? And 'Jal ja-yo,' and how can you say in informal way? Delete 'yo.' So it's 'Jalja.' OK? Good job. Everyone. We finished the five expression, also. That's amazing, really. So in this time, I'm going to tell you, 'Yes.' Like many expressions of 'yes' and many expressions of 'no.' OK? We have only five more. Oh my god. The next expression, it's, when you say, 'Yes' is 'Geu-lae-yo.' So for example, when you propose an idea, I think this idea is amazing. For example, like this. And then you can say, 'Oh, yeah.' And then you can say, 'Geu-lae-yo.' You can say 'Yes.' And then its informal way. How can you say? Its informal way. It's 'Geu-lae.' Delete 'yo.' So for example, my friend suggests, 'Why don't we go to this restaurant?' Like, Indian restaurant. It's amazing and they have an amazing curry... This is amazing. And then I say, 'Wow.' OK. So for example, I do like this way. When my friend asks me, 'Do you want to go this place?' And I was like, 'Geu-lae.' So many times. For like, my agrain? Let's go. Like this way. This is my habit. Do if you want to. You can do this, too. Show your expression, like... OK? And let's go to the next one. When you say, 'Good,' how can you say that? So if you see some like Korean Youtube, they would say, 'Gu-dok, subscribe and joh-a-yo.' In English, it's like button, right? But in Korean, 'like' is 'joh-a-yo.' So they say, please press the 'joh-a-yo' button. Ok? So 'like' is 'joh-a-yo.' So when your mom says, 'Do you want to go to the park?' Do you want to for a walk? And then I say, 'Joh-a-yo. Good.' I like it. OK? And when you say to your friends, how can you say that? What is it? It's 'Joh-a.' OK? Okidoki. And when you say, 'That's right, that's true,' and how can you say, 'That's right?' 'That's right' in Korean, it's 'Ma-ja-yo.' So for example, I can say, what is a good example? So you can say, if you ask me, 'Do you think Korean difficult or easy?' And do you think, I'm studying Korean. And I think Korean is difficult. Do you think so? And then I say, 'That's right.' If I say, 'That's right.' And then, 'Ma-ja-yo.' I can say this. That's right. I agree. But I'll help you. I'm here for you. I would say this. But I'm here for you. I would say that. OK? So 'Ma-ja-yo' is 'That's right.' So when you say to your friends, how can you say this? Not 'Ma-ja-yo.' Right 'Yo' is formal. So how can you say in informal way? Delete 'yo'. Right. So delete 'yo' and then you can say, 'Ma-ja.' OK? Good. And from now, let's learn how to say 'No.' No. How can you say no? Let's see. This is 'Ani-e-yo.' It's 'Ani-e-yo.' So for example, someone comes to me. And then, 'Oh my god, you look like 20.' And I was like, even though I'm very happy, I would say, 'No. It's not.' And I would say, 'Ani-e-yo.' It's not an appropriate example. So you can say, 'Ani-e-yo.' OK. So 'No' is 'Ani-e-yo.' OK? So it's 'Ani-e-yo.' And the last one that we're going to learn is maybe. Maybe in Korean is 'Ama-do-yo.' So are you going to study Korean? Are you going to study Korean on Sunday? And I'm not really sure. If I want to, I'm going to do that. But if I don't want to, I'm not going to do that. So you can say, 'Maybe.' So you can say, 'Ama-do-yo.' Like this. OK? And how can you say to your friends? Maybe, it's delete 'yo', right? And then you can say, 'Ama-do.' Are you going to do this? Maybe. Like this Okidoki. So we've learned the five expression, too. That's amazing. And we're going to do the repeat again, so let's do this. Let's do this from the top. Yes. Sure. How can you say this? It's, 'Geu-lae-yo.' And how can you say to your friends? Delete 'yo.' So it's 'Geu-lae.' OK? And the next one. I like it. Wow. That's the thing. I like it. How can you say that? It's 'Joh-a-yo.' It's 'Joh-a-yo.' In my case, I say, if I want to say 'Joh-a-yo,' and then I say, 'Joh-a-yo.' And this is like thumbs up. Do you want to go to the swimming pool? And then to your friends. 'Jjang' is like 'really.' OK? So Jjang joh-a. Do you want to eat tteokbokki? I'm so hungry. So I'd say, 'Jjang joh-a.' I like it. OK? The next one is 'No.' OK. Oh my god. 'That's right,' is 'Ma-ja-yo.' So that's right. OK? And the next one is 'No.' And when you say to your friends, informal, it's, I have to tell you this. Even in 'Ani-e-yo', when you say 'Ani-e', it's not right. You have to delete 'e-yo.' In this time, you have to delete 'e-yo,' two. So 'Ani-e-yo,' it's formal, and when you want to say to your friends, and then it's 'Ani.' It's right. So when your friends say, 'Do you want to eat something?' I don't want to eat something. OK? So you have to remember that. 'Ani-e-yo' and informal way, it's 'Ani.' OK. So the next one, the last one, oh my god. You're doing so great. The last one is 'Maybe.' Tomorrow is Sunday. Do you want to study? Maybe. It's 'Ama-do-yo.' So 'Ama-do-yo', informal way, to your friends, you can say, 'Ama-do.' When you say 'yo,' and it's formal. Okidoki. Oh my god. We finished 20 expressions. This is amazing. You're doing so great. I'm so happy that you followed these 20 expressions. And these expressions are really, Koreans use it every single day. So you have to remember this and then when you learn these expressions one by one, and then you can hear something from the K-pop or in K-drama or in any other Korean words, you might hear these expressions. These expressions are really mostly highly used. OK? I say it every time.
