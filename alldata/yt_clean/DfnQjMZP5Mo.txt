[Somber music] [Penny] Right away, my gut told me it wasn't no accident. [Music continues] [Leslie] At first, it appeared to be an accident when an SUV was found crashed But an autopsy would reveal that 40-year-old before the car went flying off of a curvy [John] It's an unsolved murder and tore a family apart amidst accusations the killer was her own father. [Leslie] I'm Leslie Ackerson. [John] And I'm John North. This is Appalachian Unsolved The Podcast. [Music continues] [Leslie] So you look at these pictures of Shannon Hercutt. She's really gorgeous. She has a beautiful, bright smile. You know, I think it's cliche But she did. She looks like she'd be really These old pictures, she's got [John] Family said that she was somebody who So much so that she wouldn't because she didn't want her hair messed up. You look at her and you think, And she had many other attributes She was an extremely successful businessman. She was highly self-motivated, driven to succeed. She had employees. She was a boss. She was making money. She drove a nice-looking car. She's the kind of person that she'd walk by you and you would turn around and follow her. [Penny] She was rambunctious, a [Leslie] That voice is Shannon's sister, Penny who has been her biggest advocate since her death. Penny will call us each year since Shannon's death and share with us her words of loss, her feelings, and her continued push to get answers in this case. [Penny] She was a well-to-do businesswoman. She had money with her nightly rentals. [Music continues] [Leslie] She was really well-known in the Sevier People come up there to visit the And you could stay in a cabin owned by Shannon perhaps. She had this really successful business in Pigeon Forge. It was a cabin rental business called and it was very successful. She had 130 cabins in her rental business. Obviously, it made good money. She had a nice car. And people knew her in the area. [John] People knew her well. It is interesting to me that... she lived by herself. Her family said she was a very private person. Knowing all of that 11 years later, I've always wondered, because the sheriff's office has been Did she have a boyfriend? Did she have a partner? Did she have a female partner? I don't know. But you always start looking for the But she was a very private person, and I think even her sister has told us in the past, you know, she just kind of kept some things to herself. [Penny] She didn't tell, you know, [Pensive music] [Leslie] It was the summer, August 2009. At the time we're recording this 12 years, a long time, it was a Monday, and OnStar, which is, you know, found in the vehicles and can connect you to medical professionals, it responded to a car crash that When responders got there, they found a Cadillac and inside, they found Shannon dead. We're going to hear from Sevier in his words about what happened. [Jeff] 9-1-1 received a call that was Officers responded and found a black Cadillac Escalade down an approximately 125-foot embankment. It's a rural road. It's on a mountain. We had to rappel to go down to the actual scene. [Leslie] And if you've ever been a visitor to really anywhere in the mountainous areas of Sevier County, those roads are curvy. They are windy. They're a little bit scary if you're driving them. [John] That road was a tricky road, Small, winding, certainly not the kind of place But this... Well, we don't know when the vehicle went over, but, certainly, it's the kind of road that And there was a guard rail, I think, I don't know if she jumped the guard rail or not but... or if the vehicle jumped the guard rail, but it appears that the vehicle had smacked at least As you say, it was a cliff, basically. [Leslie] And if you look it up on like it was Walker Trail Road, kind of near the And if you'll also notice, it's kind of for people really familiar with Dollywood. So responders go to this area. They see this car crash and they think, &quot;Wow, this is what has happened.&quot; &quot;This car has gone flying over the edge of this cliff.&quot; [John] Shannon is there and the first reaction is, &quot;Oh, she died as this vehicle went off the roadway.&quot; &quot;That's what happened.&quot; And it stayed that way for a few days. The vehicle was banged up, but there are a couple things that the For one thing, the window was down on her side. And as I mentioned, according to And the other thing was she And the family says she was also always extremely [Leslie] 125 feet down. They actually had to rappel down [John] That's 10 stories or more than 10 stories, Leslie. I mean, that is a long way to go down. And you look at pictures of the car and it's interesting because, yeah, it's banged up and along the left kind of the quarter You know what struck me as There's no...like the windshield, it's not busted. It's just interesting that as it that she didn't hit it. Her body didn't hit it. Nothing hit it. It's preserved. The left-hand side of the vehicle is messed up. It's a curvy windy road. She would have known about it because I think she had some properties up near there. She would have known how to drive it. If she was going any kind of a speed at all, there was no indication that she tried to brake There was, I think, one bit of indication in the dirt where the vehicle hit or at least nudged But there's a whole lot there that would tell you, this is not something where somebody More it was a deliberate act. [Leslie] So we did talk to the Sevier And they do remember going and trying to investigate what had happened. So right off the bat, they think this is a But days later, things changed. [Jeff] An autopsy was ordered During that autopsy, it was determined with an automobile accident. On Thursday, myself and another investigator were summonsed by the and the case was turned over to [Pensive music] [John] She's got wounds in the back of her head, and that's not something that she would I think the other thing is, if I'm remembering correctly, at least the family told us, they checked the...sort of the... the diagnostics or what the Cadillac was showing in terms of its speed and it was only going something like from the point where it left the 7 miles an hour, as you know, is barely moving. It is certainly not 35 or 40 miles an hour, [Leslie] There were some other strange things too. You mentioned the 7 miles per hour that the There also weren't any airbags that deployed. [John] You would have thought that once the vehicle hit nose-first something going down, it would have deployed. I don't remember if that had side airbags or not, but, certainly, you would have thought I don't know, it's a whole lot that's like, &quot;Huh? What?&quot; And after, I think the left front tire driver's side, the left front tire was blown out. Maybe the driver's side back tire was as well. But you just think there's a lot about [Leslie] After getting this autopsy report investigators now believe that and then her body placed in that vehicle. [Jeff] At that point, everybody was a suspect. We look at anyone that may have Generally, people don't kill people for no reason. In my experience, there's always [Leslie] So naturally, they look at people And, you know, this definitely stirs up between the family members themselves and created quite a bit of drama for [John] You always start looking at and that could be loved ones, a husband, a wife, And it also would be an employee. You would also be looking at employees because... sometimes the reason that I want or something that I perceive that you've done to me. Greed. There's often sex. Sex and money are often what you And, I mean, that would be my guess. 11 years later looking at this thing, 12 years later, I'd say it was somebody close to her, and it wasn't a stranger or a random act. [Leslie] Shannon's sister, Penny, She was actually on vacation when she [Penny] It's very clear. I'll never forget it. I was at Myrtle Beach. [Sniffles] I was walking on the beach collecting shells. Right away... my gut told me it wasn't no accident. There's...there has to be more to this. [Leslie] And she starts to suspect has something to do with this murder. [John] You mentioned that Penny She has said she was at Myrtle Beach That's important. Keep that in mind, that the father was also in South [Penny] There was just so many red flags that day... that I seen with my father [Somber music] and more, of course, along the I just know what he was capable of. But, at the time, I didn't feel and say what I felt because I knew my life would be in danger... or my daughter's. [Leslie] And when you ask her about motive, Penny says that she believes that he was not included in Shannon's will. [Penny] It was always something [Leslie] Yeah. [Penny] It didn't have to just be with Shannon or myself. It was always with somebody. It's like he wasn't happy if he wasn't fighting with a neighbor or any...a family member, anybody. [Leslie] Mmhmm [Penny sniffles] [Leslie] So Penny brought her accusations and this case got national attention. [John] It's interesting that she did that. It's kind of sad as well that it that she went on Dr. Phil, and I think... Ted's estranged wife went on the show as well. I remember watching it sitting in the newsroom. We have these three big monitors that sit on the wall. And we knew that Penny was going that's on in the afternoons regularly, and we're sitting there watching it and it's... it's kind of like a car wreck, in a sense, that you're watching something that because it's pretty painful to watch Nobody really likes to see that, but it was happening right in front of us. I think... I think the show acknowledged that Ted He was waiting in the wings, I think, He may have even thought because they had had a rough couple of years. And then...[laughs] and then it's his turn to come on and Penny says, &quot;You hired [Penny] He was not expecting and go to Dr. Phil and do it national. And a lot of people don't understand I had to protect myself. [Leslie] And we're going to play that happened between Penny and her [Penny] You have paid someone to kill Shannon. And don't sit there and act like you're so innocent. [Ted] I don't know where you're getting your story. [Ted] I have been cleared by the sheriff's department. [Penny] He's lying. He's a pathological liar. [Leslie] And on the Dr. Phil show, Penny accused because he wasn't included in her will. Now, Dr. Phil did look through some records. And in 2003, Ted Hercutt was included in Shannon's will, but three years later, 2006, this would he was taken out of her will. It was changed. Ted, at the time, denied knowing [Ted] Shannon told me that, &quot;Dad, I &quot;That you own half of it.&quot; I said, &quot;No.&quot; [Penny cries] [Ted] &quot;Shannon, I don't want that.&quot; [Phil] Why is it upsetting for you to hear this? [Penny] It's all lies. [Penny sniffles] [Leslie] Penny, to this day, still She still believes her father was I will say, the Sevier County Sheriff's Office, and later they bring the TBI, the as they often do when they need a little bit more never said anything about Ted being involved. He was never faced with any charges. They never said they had any evidence against him. That came from authorities of And Ted continued to deny that he had that he wasn't involved, remained his innocence. Back in 2009, we spoke with Ted Hercutt and this is what he said. [Ted] I wake up crying knowing my baby ain't there no more. And people thinking I'm [inaudible] and [Leslie] Now, Ted is no longer here. He actually died in November of 2017. [John] This is an unusual case in that... you have the family saying, or at least &quot;We know who did it.&quot; And the law enforcement authority is That's an odd case. In all the cases that we've covered, that may be the first one I can where you've got this disconnect. I wish we could tell everybody that we have great confidence in more facts about what happened to Shannon Hercutt. We don't. Sevier County has not released a whole lot. We've learned more from the I mentioned the OnStar data, I think even the wounds to Shannon I think we could have gotten from the family. There's more apparently. According to Penny, there was evidence Some overturned or broken bottles. Some blood, I think, on the refrigerator, maybe. Clearly evidence of a struggle inside the house. We don't know that from the sheriff's office. They have released so little. Kind of a characteristic of Sevier County I don't even know if we've gotten a police report, Leslie, which is also kind of unusual. We usually, at least, get something like that. But it's... it's a very sad case in the sense that this...we watched a family sort of turn against itself. I have no doubt based on how her dad was a strong character and that there was some bad blood between them. Ted Hercutt is no longer here to so we don't know. [Penny] My father had every or try to prove his innocence but he never did. So...and I wished...I wished he would have. I mean, I would have been 100 percent relieved, and I would have gone on national But... there's a...you know, there's a big part of me that... or a whole part of me that knows he had a hand in this big time. [Leslie] You know, we catch up with Penny every year. She advocates. &quot;Can we talk about Shannon's story again?&quot; &quot;This is so important to me to And we did speak the other day and she mentioned that there were other A TV show that wanted to come in and help but was getting turned down She wants to keep pushing on this. Now, when we go to the sheriff's department, I did talk to Jeff McCarter, who's an investigator there, and he says they are still trying efforts. They do open this case up every so often. And when you walk into the you pass a photo of Shannon. [Jeff] It's hanging out there so not only myself, but everybody that walks sees her picture and that case is never forgotten. I think there's always hope that a case can be solved. We're not going to stop working on this case. And I really believe that there's if they would just come forward. [Leslie] But they ran into something They thought it was a car accident. Days later, an autopsy comes back, and you wonder, &quot;Was everything important &quot;Was the car extracted?&quot; &quot;What had happened to her body?&quot; You lose precious time. Days go by where that initial fresh crime [John] What happened to the vehicle? Did they try to get prints off the vehicle? Certainly, there are members who, I think, turned to somebody who had to sort of think about what could have happened. There, certainly, was a suggestion early on that because law enforcement viewed this, initially, that they didn't process the vehicle Lots of questions. Lots of reasons to say, &quot;If we could go back in time, we [Penny] As soon as the Tennessee sheriff's department, which was like four they went to her house and they've seen a lot of... things that were red flags. [Jeff] Quicker you can start investigating But, in that case, you know, that But, immediately, once it became a case for us, we immediately took possession of that vehicle and obtained a warrant and searched her house. We found... things in the house that give us some Well, of course, in any investigation, You know, it's whatever is there, I can't talk about that evidence but we did obtain some evidence. And even today, as we speak, some because of the technology that's been developed. [John] They did an autopsy. I wish I could tell you what we know, but we don't have that paperwork in front of us. We didn't get those records, haven't been released. There's a whole lot that we don't know. Did they do a toxicology report on Shannon? What did that show? I don't know. Do we have an estimated time of death? I don't know. It probably exists. But I can't tell you. I saw one report in, I think it was in the by one press outlet that said, from the lead investigator, &quot;If I told you who we think may have done it,&quot; &quot;then you would know the obvious motive.&quot; So I don't know what that means. I'm guessing money, but I don't know. [Leslie] You know, 12 years is a really And, as we know, when a lot investigators, family hopes that money will talk. There is a reward in this case, It's grown over the years. Back when Shannon was killed, her father and stepmother sent a letter to the asking him to assign TBI to the case. And the state also put in $20,000. I don't know if that was under but the state put in that money of $20,000. Her business, which went to her sister and put in $5,000 and her sister, Penny, That reward is still active, and that money would go to someone that could secure a conviction of someone. But nobody has talked, even for a large amount. [John] If the killer says nothing and nobody else knows about this or has any inkling, then the secret of the homicide And the killer's not going to be motivated how many nibbles have there been on that? I don't know. It's 12 years later, and this case is still open. And near as I can tell, we've Again, think about these facts. It's a staged scene where somebody has put her body in her own vehicle and, basically, let it go over a That's how it was assumed by law enforcement. And there may have been some key that we'll maybe never get back. You know, Leslie, I was thinking when we were talking about reviewing it since I even wondered if it would be possible, at some point, they've talked about that there's been or some further testing on evidence. I wonder if it will be necessary, to bring her back up to do some I don't know. There's one sort of oddity about this case... well, it's not the only one... but there is one oddity that's worth mentioning. After Shannon is killed, some months later...what was it? Maybe October or November, I think... [Leslie] November of 2009. [John] 2009, there's an odd thing that happens outside the cabin rental and real estate business. Somebody fires a gun repeatedly at the business. I don't think any...nobody was hurt. I don't even know that it was even open at the time. It's kind of an odd thing. Penny accused her dad of being the person who did it, and I think she says he even acknowledged [Laughs] Whatever his motive, if Ted did it, Is it an expression of anger, frustration? Is it trying to throw the case off? Is it...is it him saying, &quot;I am the killer and Who knows? Again, we can't ask him because he's but it's just kind of another one of those You look at, you go, &quot;All right, what does that mean?&quot; &quot;Why did that happen?&quot; &quot;If Ted did it, why did he do it?&quot; &quot;If somebody else did it, why did they do it?&quot; We don't know. [Pensive music] [Leslie] Penny, this still affects her greatly to this day. She moved out of state. She sold her shares of Auntie Belham's. She actually says a lot of their other family members won't help her get any justice for Shannon, but she wants to keep pushing for this year after year and get some answers. [Penny] Yeah, I'm very disappointed in... the Sevier County law enforcement investigators. Very disappointed in TBI and the DA's office. And I hate to say that. I truly think the investigators, the law enforcement has just set it on a shelf right now. [John] If it wasn't Ted and if the real killer is out there, that person is staying very quiet. And I guess I have to ask the question, if it wasn't Ted Hercutt who killed Shannon, Whatever it was they were seeking, did they get it? [Penny] I still need closure. I still need justice for Shannon. Even though I still, it's so fresh in my gut that You know, yes, he's been gone but I... that person that did it or people and we need to find out who is responsible. I would love to get that phone call that say, &quot;Penny, we got the people that did this to your sister.&quot; &quot;And we're going to go to court.&quot; &quot;We're gonna put him in jail.&quot; &quot;We're gonna prosecute them.&quot; &quot;We're gonna get justice finally.&quot; [John] Shannon would be which is a little bit hard to believe. And, you know, I'm just sort of what she'd be doing if she were still alive. She'd be, probably, even more probably live in a bigger house. Considering what we learned about family relations, you know, probably still be dealing with that but... It's a shame on so many levels that this has happened and we just have so many [Penny] She was a fighter. I know she tried to fight through this ordeal, and...but she just didn't quite make this fight. [Pensive music] [Leslie] If you have any information you can call 1-800-TBI-FIND. There might possibly also be a reward available if you're able to give information and an answer in this case. [Pensive music fades]
