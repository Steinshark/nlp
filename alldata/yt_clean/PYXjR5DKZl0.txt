Let's go buy a motorbike, motorbike. From far away, we're struggling Okay .. but enough money, right? Look at me and my baby, it's so hard. Let 's go see it, shall we? The other day, did you find a small shop selling used motorbikes, reputable, good quality and reasonable price ? Is it close? The other day when he bought my orange, he gave me 6 million dong. Do you think it's enough to buy a used car? Enough ... it's a bit sunny but luckily that place is close. My friend bought it there before and now he still drives that car. Have you had enough? Let's go home, shall we? Um, let's go home and buy a car. Vietnamese Protestant Church (Northern Region) Hello? Hello I buy and sell used motorbikes, yes.. I need to buy a motorbike. Do you have a motorbike that can go up hills? I have Come in here and sit down for a drink, I advise you carefully. Come in . Come in here... you sit in the chair. Here, please, you two, have a drink... thank you. The car here has registration papers and warranty? Here I sell with full papers and warranty. Okay, let us see the car. Okay, just take a look first and I will give you a price. Let's go look at the car and see which car you like. The only cars here are Just 10, which one do you like ? Our house is far up in the mountains. Do you have any that are strong enough to go up the mountain? There are a few here.. this one is also very good at climbing mountains, but if it's strong, this one is stronger. But it's a manual bike so it will be a bit difficult to drive. Should I just buy a manual car? The clutch line is difficult to move. I think you should buy this wave. I just installed a smaller set of front sprockets so it will be 3 times stronger than a regular bike. You can rest assured that that type of sprocket is very popular. If it wears out later, this will happen. I will replace it, the price is very reasonable , this one is like that... do you think I should buy this one? Can you help us start the engine? The lights are still on. It's very bright at night. I also have a 1-year warranty on the car's electrical system. If there's any damage, I'll replace it for free . Let's take it for a test drive. You're welcome to go. OK , we bought this one. Can you help me check if there are any mistakes? I don't understand this very well. Please read it to see if there's anything unreasonable? Hey, take a look, you two just take a look, if you think it's reasonable, sign it and you're done. This car is 6,000,000 VND, right? Do you have any questions? No, sign here . Sign here. Here, keep it. I have it. If you pay in full, I'll give you the car registration. I just need to pay it all and I'm done, right? That's right, payment is complete. Please give me the money... here, wait for me. Be good... here, I'll count. I'll count again for you . That's enough... wait for me for a moment. Here, I'll check for you. Okay. Okay... is there anything else? No.. you can take the car home. Let's go home. Thank you for supporting me.. if there's any problem behind the car, just come here and I'll help. Have a safe trip .
