My dear sangha, and we are in the 21-day retreat Our breathing should be should bring us joy. And... if it happens that at that moment the right thing to do is and enjoy your breathing because your breathing is enjoyable. And when you enjoy your breathing, I believe that you already know Calm/ease, Present moment/wonderful moment.&quot; You drive your car, this short poem for your breathing. You sit on a bus or on the train, you practice also And suppose you are That is the time also to practice and smile to yourself, smile to &quot;Breathing in, I know I am breathing in; And we summarize these two sentences Breathe in such a way that you enjoy Then that is a success. It's a very simple exercise, you realize miracles. Just breathing in, Breathing out, enjoy it. And be one with your in-breath. And become fully alive, That is nothing less than a miracle that you can produce &quot;Breathing in, I know I am breathing in; &quot;In&quot;... &quot;Out.&quot; When you do like that, mindfulness is there, You stop all your thinking, your projects. You are one with your breathing. After a few minutes of breathing like that, the quality of your breathing And you may like to try the second line: It means, &quot;Breathing in, I know that It has become deep by itself, not because of your intention If you practice &quot;in/out&quot; naturally your in-breath Cannot be avoided. When mindfulness touches something, That is why your breathing calmer, And that produces a more pleasant feeling So &quot;deep/slow&quot; means, &quot;Breathing in, I notice that Breathing out, I notice that It just means that has been improved. When you begin this exercise, the pleasure is already there with the &quot;in/out.&quot; And that pleasure... continues to grow And now, you know that because now your in-breath and out-breath more calm, more harmonious, and it helps your body to be And also it has an effect So when you practice &quot;deep/slow,&quot; because the quality of the breath And later on you may try &quot;Calm, ease.&quot; &quot;Breathing in, I feel calm within my body and my mind.&quot; If you want, you can see it as &quot;Breathing in, &quot;I calm the formation called body.&quot; &quot;Breathing out, I calm the formation So this is exactly the practice in the sutra on mindful breathing. &quot;Experiencing the feeling, I breathe in; &quot;Calming the feeling, I breathe in; &quot;Calm&quot; means, &quot;Breathing in, Not only my body is calm, but also my feeling So you experience your body, and you breathe in and out first your body &quot;Ease&quot; means, &quot;Breathing out... I feel at ease, I ease everything, I take time to live my daily life. I am not in a hurry. I feel wonderful in this moment.&quot; It means, ease -- You don't feel burdened by your worries, You feel you have the freedom within your body. not a victim of your worries, not a victim of your past &quot;Calm, ease.&quot; And, of course, that exercise is &quot;Breathing in, I feel calm Breathing out, I feel very much I take everything at ease.&quot; In/out, deep/slow, calm/ease, and then &quot;smile/release.&quot; &quot;Breathing in, I smile; I let go of my projects, of my regret concerning the past because the present moment And I am capable of touching &quot;Breathing in, I smile.&quot; And the smile has the capacity of on your face, on your body. This is a smile of victory. This is a smile directed to your own body, And when you breathe out, &quot;Release.&quot; Nothing is as important as your stability, You cannot exchange these Nothing is worth... to exchange your well-being, So &quot;release&quot; here means You are capable of releasing your ideas, Each of us is caught... in our idea of happiness. We believe that we'll be truly happy are available. So we have an idea about happiness. And we don't know that... that very idea of happiness is And if you are capable of happiness will be Well, there's a young man who thinks... that he can only be happy there is another young person if he cannot get into that position, then happiness will not be possible. So we set up conditions for our happiness, But happiness can come to us if we are a free person. Why are you committed When you are committed you limit your capacity of being happy. And if you let go happiness can come One country might be caught the whole nation might think that unless we embrace that ideology there will be no future And maybe for 50 years or 70 years, we are caught by that idea of happiness and we have created a lot of tragedy just because we got caught And maybe 50, 70 years later, that idea of happiness has been of the whole nation. So if you are lucky, As individuals, we also commit We invent an idea of happiness. We cling to it. And we say that unless I realize this, That is why many of us cannot be happy. So releasing... releasing things, is a very important practice. And among these things, Let us look deeply and we might find out that that has prevented us And this teaching is very clear &quot;Breathing in, I smile. I know happiness is possible The wonders of life are available I can touch them. And that is why, You are very smart that have prevented you You can be extremely happy and breathing in and out. You don't have to do anything, you just sit down there, and if you know how to breathe in and out, You enjoy the miracle of life, So &quot;smile/release&quot; You need to be nourished by that joy, that happiness. And that joy, that happiness the wounds within your body And finally the last exercise &quot;Present moment, &quot;Breathing in, I establish myself Breathing out, I know If someone comes &quot;Has the most wonderful moment We may feel embarrassed... We may say, &quot;Well, it does not but I strongly believe Otherwise my life will have no meaning. The most wonderful moment of my my life, But if we use our intelligence to look, if we continue to live... exactly in the way we have lived not mindful at all, always running, always trying to escape -- then that most wonderful moment be likely to arrive in the next 20 years. That is something logical. But in this teaching you learn... that you have to... to make the present moment because the present moment And if you know how to to be fully present, to touch the wonders of life that moment can become And you know you have the capacity And by very simple practices like... walking, breathing, smiling, touching with mindfulness you can make... paradise. You can make the Kingdom of God in the here and the now.
