It is the machine within you, called the mind. Lets go a little deeper into this. A very wealthy man used to worship his Lord in the temple and was once inspired to prepare a particularly delicious, sumptuous feast. He began thinking what offering would please his Lord the most, when he heard a voice from above. God was speaking. "If you offer Me the &lt;i&gt;manas pushpam&lt;/i&gt;, I will be perfectly satiated. This &lt;i&gt;manas pushpam&lt;/i&gt; is nearby." The man went around searching for it, asking neighbors, but nobody could help him find and locate the &lt;i&gt;manas pushpam&lt;/i&gt; that was nearby. Finally feeling lost, he gave up, came and fell in front of the deity and said, "My Lord, I have failed. I have now nothing to offer to You except my heart." He again heard a voice. God said, "That is the &lt;i&gt;manas pushpam.&lt;/i&gt;" When we say heart, one is the physical heart. The other is the etheral heart, which is a synonym for the mind. This mind is extremely subtle and extremely powerful as well. Consider, subtler than all matter are the atoms that constitute it. And yet these atoms are power packed with atomic energy. Subtler than the atoms are our five knowledge senses with which we see, hear, taste, smell, feel. Subtler than these senses and even more powerful is the mind. The senses, they have their physical limitations in perceiving what is around them. The mind has no such limitation. *Sanskrit Verse* In a moment, it can go to the celestial abodes. In the next moment, it can be the nether regions. The senses are ultimately instruments that bring knowledge, information to you. The mind, however, can analyze, create thoughts, emotions, sentiments. It is the factory of your thoughts. That is why the Scriptures say, "It's very important to learn the art of cultivating the garden of your mind." Let's see what my latest book, Spiritual Secrets from Hinduism, says about this. If we have a garden at home, we tend do it daily. We fertilize the soil. We sow appropriate seeds and water the plants regularly. At the same time, we are careful to weed out the wild grass as it grows faster than the plants themselves, and will choke them out. Hence, if we work hard at tending our garden, it rewards us with luscious fruits and beautiful flowers. However, if we leave it to grow wild, it is quickly overrun by weeds and becomes an eyesore. The mind, too, is like a garden given to us by God. Its fertile soil has the potential for providing us with inspiring thoughts and noble feelings. However, we have to tend to it carefully. We need to continuously fertilize it with elevating sentiments and pull out the weeds of poisonous emotions. The mind will then reward us with a sterling and heroic character to accomplish great things. This mind is the cause of our experience of happiness and distress. One person is happily seated. You go and say a sentence in his ear that creates a morose thought. The expression on his face changes and he seems dejected now. Another person seems in the forlorn mood. You go and say something to cheer him up and a smile breaks out on his face. Again, thoughts created the misery and thoughts can create the happiness. Thoughts, feelings, emotions are all produced in the factory of the mind. That is why our Scriptures say, "Look, our Scriptures say, "Look, the cause of bondage and liberation is not your body, the clothes you wear, or the sacred marks you apply. It is the machine within you, called the mind. Bhagavad Gita 6.5 The Panchadashi's famous &lt;i&gt;udghosh&lt;/i&gt;. If the mind is stuck in worldly contemplation, you are in bondage. If the mind is filled with noble, devotional thoughts, you will be liberated. One English writer, Samuel Johnson, he said, "With an unquiet mind, no amount of exercise, medicine or physics is of any use." An American philosopher, Oliver Wendell Holmes said, "Beauty of this mind is that once expanded to higher dimensions, It never returns to its original size." The master of the mind was Adi Shankaracharya, who 2500 years ago declared, &lt;i&gt;"Jagat jitam kena?&lt;/i&gt; Who shall influence and impact the world.?" And the answer he provided was, &lt;i&gt;"Mano hi yena.&lt;/i&gt; Those who have succeeded in conquering their own mind." Swami Vivekananda, it seems, understood this secret. And that is why, before departing for the US on his legendary travel to the West, he said, "I shall lift my mind to such heights that I inspire people everywhere until the world realizes it is one with God." What a noble intention and inspiration! Lets go a little deeper into this. What are these? The mind is that aspect of the &lt;i&gt;antahkaran&lt;/i&gt;, the etheral heart, which creates feelings, emotions and thoughts. The intellect is that dimension of it, which is engaged in the work of analysis, determination on the right and wrong, comprehension, and coming up with solutions. The &lt;i&gt;chit&lt;/i&gt; is what psychologists call subconscious. It is the one that gets attached and clings. And then is the &lt;i&gt;ahankar&lt;/i&gt; or the ego. These four are not separate entities. They are levels of functioning of the same &lt;i&gt;antahkaran&lt;/i&gt; or mind. Hence, in some scriptures they are simultaneously referred to as the mind. The Panchadashi said, "The mind in totality will be the cause of bondage." Shri Krishna refers to them as two, mind and intellect. "Arjun, surrender the mind to Me, and surrender the intellect as well." Then Yog &lt;i&gt;darshan&lt;/i&gt; analyzes them as three. In the enumeration of the different elements of nature, it says, &lt;i&gt;"Mann, buddhi, ahankar."&lt;/i&gt; And Adi Shankaracharya, in his dissertation, Sharirik bhashya, etc., he explains them as four, &lt;i&gt;mann, buddhi, chit, ahankar,&lt;/i&gt; but they are all referring to the same etheral heart. Now this etheral heart is made from the material energy which is constituted of the three &lt;i&gt;gunas&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;sattva, rajas and tamas.&lt;/i&gt; The &lt;i&gt;gunas&lt;/i&gt; exist in maya, and they exist in our mind as well. Shvetashvatara Upanishad Verse 5 *Sanskrit Verse* The Shvetashvatara Upanishad states that maya is &lt;i&gt;tirangi,&lt;/i&gt; tri-coloured, and so is our mind. By virtue of the environment and our own contemplation of thoughts, one or the other &lt;i&gt;guna&lt;/i&gt; starts dominating and then the congruent thoughts arise more easily. For example, let us say you are in your study room, absorbed in your book. There is no distraction. Your mind is at peace and the temperament has become &lt;i&gt;sattvik.&lt;/i&gt; Consequently, your desires have eased. You have a slight experience of inner joy. The qualities of kindness, tolerance, etc., are now manifesting, the thirst for knowledge and so on. However, after your study, you move to the living room and put on the TV set. Watching the news, your mind becomes worldly. Rajoguna now dominates, resulting in the inflammation of your sensual and mental desires. In the meantime, your spouse comes and without your permission changes the channel. That annoys you. Tamoguna, now, raises its head and you become angry. So such is the complex nature of this mind Saints, focused on it, as the primary laboratory for self improvement. And we need to take inspiration from them. Sant Tukaram who lived in Maharashtra about 400 years ago, began writing and singing bhajans in devotion to his Lord, and when he would sing, hundreds and even thousands would flock to hear, but not everybody was pleased. It aroused the ire of a section of people. In particular, the scholarly class got irritated at his growing influence and they provoked a big scholar of that region, Rameshwar Shastri. Indignant, Rameshwar Shastri went to Tukaram and said, "Who gave you the authority to explain in your abhangas, bhajans, secrets from the Vedas? This is a very irreligious act. Tukaram had tremendous faith in the scriptures and the priests and took the words of Rameshwar Shastri seriously. He said, "Maharaj, what should I do?" Ramesh Shastri said, "Make a bundle of all your writings and throw them into the river Indrayani." Obediently, Tukaram did exactly that. Yet it made him terribly dejected. And he began thinking that I had received a divine injunction from my Lord to glorify Him and spread His bhakti and now I've thrown all these works. For 13 days he was sitting morosely at the river bank until Bhagwan Himself inspired his disciple, who discovered the bundle downstream and brought it back to Tukaram. Tukaram took it as a divine indication from his Lord, but needed a further confirmation to continue his work. In the meantime, the Pandit Ramesh Shastri took a dip in a lake of infected water because of which his whole body got diseased and began burning. He took it as a message from His Lord and he wrote a note to Tukaram apologizing for the mistake he had made. Tukaram, with complete serenity, wrote a note back. "One who has controlled the mind is not disturbed by any kind of adversity, and for him, there are no enemies. When the mind is mastered, even the bodily inflammations, they cease." Rameshwar Shastri read that and his faith in Tukaram increased. He went and surrendered to him as his disciple and became an ardent follower. So let us take inspiration from the Scriptures and Saints like Tukaram and focus on the art of managing our mind. We shall discuss it in the next episode, Vedic Psychology, in this series Spiritual Secrets from Hinduism.
