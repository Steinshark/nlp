You must have all heard He wanted to kill Jesus, so instructed He also was the one to expand that big giant temple, But what you might not know is that Herod the Great also constructed what Jews would consider (Sergio) <i>In this episode, <i>where the ruins of a pagan temple <i>remain to this day.</i> (Rhoda) It has just something on it, (Sergio) <i>But why did Herod, <i>who was appointed as King of the Jews,</i> <i>who expanded the Second Temple <i>why would a seemingly pious Jew You must think very sided with the Jews. Well, actually he also sided He played on both sides, and today we're going to explore one of those up at the north of Israel (Sergio) <i>In this video, <i>What was Herod's motivation <i>of all the infants in Bethlehem <i>And could this temple be the missing clue (music) Okay, it's time for a short Ready? Let's go. King Herod the Great and he lived in the first century BC. Herod is very famous He was the one who expanded to an unprecedented size In fact, today his architecture style that we even have a name for it, But if you haven't heard you surely heard According to the Gospel of Matthew, King Herod was the one who wanted He wanted him dead so badly that when he heard and he could not find him he ordered all of the male children two years and younger to be killed. Most of my life I thought simply following his piousness, constructing this extraordinary But no, recently we found out that he was trying to find favor and he constructed three pagan temples. And here is the mystery. (Sergio) <i>Josephus Flavius, <i>writes that King Herod the Great</i> <i>constructed three magnificent temples <i>Two temples have been found, <i>one in Caesarea Maritima and another one <i>However, the third temple, <i>near Banias, a city also known But some archaeologists were puzzled because there's just to support the writings of Josephus, at least not until 1998. <i>At the end of the 90s,</i> <i>a team of archaeologists <i>at a site called Horvat Omrit.</i> <i>They found the foundation <i>that they thought to be the very temple <i>Could this be the missing temple And if it, is how is it all related To find the answers and examine the site for ourselves. (music) The snow is right at the top but just at the peak. (upbeat music) (Anna) Let's see about turning around (Sergio) Yeah. (Rhoda) <i>I'm so happy <i>She is a walking encyclopedia, <i>so she had a lot of good insight She has been to Israel, so she's incredible. (music) (Sergio) She was actually the one If she didn't tell us about it, that King Herod built pagan temples. <i>So it is really cool that she is here (Sergio) I can see it's right over there. (Anna) Yeah. (Rhoda) Oh, should we cross like that? (music) (Sergio) I don't suppose or tourist accessible. (Rhoda) No, I don't think I think we are here in the wrong season. This is not going to be easy. Oh, your poor shoes. <i>(Rhoda) The mud is sticking to my shoes,</i> <i>and my feet are becoming and it's just not very comfortable. It's so beautiful though. You can see the split hoofs for the cows, because you can see also So they chew the cud We can definitely eat one. (music) I think we have a problem. It's been raining a lot. (Rhoda) We can go from there. (Sergio) <i>At a first glance <i>but it's going to get your shoes wet,</i> and you don't want that (Rhoda) Is it doable on the sides? Like on the green stuff. (Sergio) <i>Rhoda and I are now I'm saying, all right, I can go look for wood, or us thinking, okay, <i>I'm going to see their spots <i>and just cross it this way, great, then we look around just easily walking right through it, and she just makes it look What do you think? I'm not taking off my shoes, That's the only way. (music) It's nice and fresh. Next time I'm taking fishing boots, Thank you. (Rhoda) <i>I have <i>I don't know what I would do without him.</i> (Sergio) Wait. We have to do this on the way back too. Ugh. (music) (Sergio) <i>We're finally at the temple. (music) <i>I can't believe <i>Look at just those stairs. Wow!</i> <i>In the report of the excavations</i> <i>I remember seeing that there are and one is for the temple, they found a later but we came here to examine the temple, (Sergio) Beautiful steps. <i>The [inaudible] report says That's very tall. <i>Especially standing here in this area, <i>this being so tall would have really - (Rhoda) Oh, there are stairs here. Look. It says something on it. (Sergio) <i>This is certainly <i>It looks Greek to me.</i> <i>But I don't speak or read Greek,</i> <i>but if somebody's watching this it will be cool, if they could know what it says. (Rhoda) Go, go, see inside in there. (music) This is just awesome, look at these guys. Plaster from 2,000 years ago, structure. (Sergio) <i>These giant limestone boulders <i>from somewhere afar off,</i> <i>because in this area It's all basalt. Wow, this blaster is 2,000 years old, I've never seen it preserved so well. Incredible. (Anna) No wonder Josephus would have even though it's made of limestone, it was plastered and maybe even painted (Rhoda) Guys, I'm going to show you (Sergio) Rock preserved but you can see there the original plaster Look how beautiful. Like with many there's usually more than one theory. And this one in particular One group believes the temple was built inside the old city of Banias, while the other group believes and there are two wonderful BAR articles dating back to 2003 that are written One of them presents a lot of evidence in support for this place while the other Let's put the location of the temple and ask these questions: Why did Herod build it And what does this have to do with Jesus? (Sergio) <i>From historical writings we know</i> <i>that Herod wanted to find favor <i>so that he may stay in power,</i> <i>that he may stay the King over Judea.</i> It seems like if you truly follow you wouldn't dare to build a pagan temple. But he did, which means that politics and power than the Law of Moses. And this sheds a lot of light and could be the reason According to Matthew chapter 2 and started asking, &quot;Where is He for we saw His star in the East King of the Jews? It must have been that he immediately summoned and inquired them and they gave him the answers The Messiah was to be born in Bethlehem. Herod knew that is being fulfilled The Jews, they were waiting and according to the Gospel of Matthew And Herod knew it. If he didn't believe Jesus then he wouldn't have cared or kill the entire Could it be that Herod because he knew and he did not want and give it to Christ? (music) There's a river! If there's a river, Sergio's there. (purl of water) (Sergio) <i>I love water.</i> <i>If there is fresh water, I'm going there.</i> It's source of life, (Rhoda) Is it cold? Oh, it's freezing. (Rhoda) <i>That looks fun.</i> If it was a little warmer, Did you zoom in? - (Rhoda) Yeah. (Rhoda) I'm zooming out. (Sergio) I don't know how to get back. That was fantastic.
