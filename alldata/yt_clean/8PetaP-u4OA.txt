Can we figure out how without instructions? Let's talk about that Good Mythical Morning. You want to see a magic trick? Yeah. Okay. Look deep into my eyes. You are thinking, how can I interrupt Stevie when she is trying to while maintaining a boyish charm, being a little bit annoying? How did you do that? I'll never tell. But let's see if we can figure out without instructions. It's time for Abra-Cah-Dab Duh. Magic Tricks Without Instructions. Okay, non-religious, you're gonna use some combination perform your first magic trick. Your lifeline. Is it okay if I take the hat off? Are as follows. I can tell you which items are the decoys, There are two decoys for this round. We can tell you the name of the trick, A surprise guest will mime the prestige, magician lingo, for the final part of the And if you don't figure out the you will lose five points. You're gonna start out and you need to retain at game to avoid a punishment. Your time starts now. We have a cup. We have a second. Whoa. Is it okay if I take these off, too? That is slick. It's a slick cup, man. Almost lost your boyish We have a. Bottle. Bottle. We have. Oh, my gosh. Look at that. Okay, okay, okay, okay. All right. That is a box cutter. We have a stabber, and a. Apple. Apple. You're having trouble just I know. It's scaring me a little bit. Are you okay? Yarn and water. Yes. Magicians love to use yarn. I feel like this is and I think you might be right. Did you hear me? This cup has a hole in the bottom. So, they've pre-drilled holes in this. Yeah. So, this is a definite keeper. Something to do with the yarn in the hole. And if you put that. But hold on, but also maybe. Oh, you know what? So, if we take this. There's so many items, We need. Stevie. We need to be told. You asking for both or one? One. You do not need the gold cups. Are you serious? See? That's why we asked. You really saved us. So. We could pull the whole What we could do, is we could, And then the yarn goes in there, Do you think we could get the the yarn? Yeah, maybe. Maybe we cut this and the apple is inside. Yes. I don't watch a lot of magic. I think we need to know the nect. Hold on. You know what? No. We can know the name of the trick. The name of the trick. We would like to know Oh, it comes in a hat. So. Okay. A tight sneeze. Squeeze. A tight squeeze. So it is, how do you get this? How do you get. How do you get an apple? Oh, you know what? You're gonna cut this in a way that they won't know that it's cut. And then the apple is gonna. Like apple sized. We're gonna make the apple go in and out of it without. I think if you do this. No, don't. I would have gone, Now, look. Cause that doesn't change the integrity. And this is a little apple slot. Okay. Slide your apple in there. So, but, we have to create a distraction. Yeah, drink. Watch the men drink. Watch the men. Pay no mind to me. Pay mind to the man drinking. Can you believe that? I got this apple inside this. That's not normal. Look at the. Talk about apple juice, much. So, we can either get the You got the name. We got the name of the trick. That's why the apple's inside the bottle, Cause this is a tight sqeeze. Can we change the name? You can get rid of another decoy for a point. Or the miming of the prestige for three points. Let's get the miming of the prestige. The final part of the trick. See? Cause I think. I think we need another. Well, let's watch the trick. Let's watch the final part of the trick. Let's do it. Let's mine it. Oh, wow. Look at Trevor. Oh, Trevor. Trevor! That is not Trevor. Because we had Science Mike on previously. This is Magic Mike. Magic Mike. So, please call him Magic Mike. What was the first part? You want to see that again? Yeah, I do, actually. Only the first part. See, he's, okay. See what? Okay, see, what he was doing was. He was doing this, and then he was. I think these are the balls. What? You mean the apple? I mean the apple. I'm sorry. And look, it's this. I think when you go like this. The apple goes in, and then you go like this. And the apple goes up and down. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Uh huh. Less than five minutes. Oh, that's plenty of time. That's plenty of time for these guys. Here we go. Oh. Oh, you know what? Hold on. I think you might be almost right. Watch. Because if you do this, if I cover up anywhere that you see, whoa. That's not what he did. Well, he was doing this. We got to remove another item. He was really in. It was almost like he went like that. I don't think we need water. So, then what do we do with the yarn? I think the yarn's a decoy. I think we've done it. But then the water. You can't put water. That's just for drinking. You can't put water in a. That's for breaks. Water's for magician breaks. No, Rhett. What's the other decoy? Sorry. You do not need the black yarn. I knew we didn't need it. So, we need another bottle. So. Yeah, that's nice. You good at that. We don't have a lot of time, man. And then they. We got to do it. He did this. And then he did this. Maybe it looks like the apple is in there, it. Yes. Hold on. Oh, look how much bigger the apple is. Oh, I know what to do. I know what to do. Watch. Look at this apple. And you hold it like this because You're like, look at this apple that we got kids. And then you're like, I don't know. We have this, man. We do have to cut the. Can I? Cut a, cut it to where it'll hinge over this way, Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's out too far. Why am I the one having to This is it, David Copperfield. Why are you getting your Cause I have to hold it steady for you. Now hinge it. Less than a minute. Okay, now. Now. There's too much. Drink some of the water. Drink some of the water. Take a break. Take a magic break. Take a magic break. Pay no attention to the man drinking. How do I get this apple into my bottle? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Like that. But you have to do this, man. You have to. Ten. You have to do this, dude. Forgot about this part. And time. We got it right, pretty much. Basically. I hate magic. Okay. Dude, we failed. Well, I think you knew what you Well, of course. Yes, she's right. But let's see what Magic Mike. It is I, Magic Mike. And prepare to be mystified by my plump, And this first trick, a tight squeeze. He's an old timey magician. He's pantomiming? He got rid of the whole back of it. The whole back of the bottle is gone. That was our problem. He created a window. Oh, yes, Trevor. I mean Magic Mike. Yep. Get it? Oh, so he did that and then he did Yeah, right. And if you were just a you'd be crapping your Yeah, and wondering why he Yeah, well, the shirt. Give us another chance. I like that. So, you used every possible point in that first round. That's the idea. Right? Sure. This one has three decoys, so just keep that in mind So, we have a hat that expands. Ooh, nice. We have a light bulb that's fake. This is an unbreakable light bulb. Look at that. That is. It doesn't have anything in it. We have a vial of what is labeled as salt water. Salt water. We have a ring that looks like it could. It doesn't. It's an expandable ring, but it's a ring. It's like a fake ring. It could get smaller or bigger. A ring, a finger ring. And then we have a balloon. Now this doesn't seem There's nothing here that can And there's three decoys. Is there anything in the hat? No plugs. Maybe we already did it, look at this flat thing. A hat! Right? Is that it? I don't think we need the light bulb. Who needs salt water? But what about putting the doing something to like, Yeah, yeah. Well I thought what you were gonna do. Like, the air goes in my mouth. I was thinking the exact opposite. And it pops up. So put the inflated balloon in there. No, no, no. It's more of a clown type thing. When I blow the balloon, So, like, put it on my head. Yeah, but how you gonna make it go down? You're gonna do it with your hand. This is a double act. Do I make a distraction? I drink. No, you just talk to the audience. Ladies and gentlemen, watch my friend. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, No, on my hat. On the man blowing the balloon. Okay, can you? Ladies and gentlemen, Look straight. Ladies and gentlemen, my friend has a completely He's gonna blow it up, you'll see his hat. Let's start with the balloon only. Now, currently, my friend looks like but he is not. He's a magician. And we will reveal that in mere moments. What's the name of this trick? We'll go into negative. We'll make it up later. Names. That's it. All right. Name of the trick is, A Bright Idea. I need this thing again. So, we need the bulb that you threw away. Crap. Oh, you know what? You think it has to turn on? I bet you we don't need. I bet you it does turn on. You think if it just touches salt water, Maybe pour it over it? We did it. That's right. Okay, hold on, hold on. So stop. And that's it. No, no, it's not it. What do you mean, that's not it? That's it. That was amazing. So, how would I make? I mean, do you want to wear the hat? How would I make it into a trick? How do I make it into a trick? Give me some more salt water. I have the idea. How many decoys, right? So this. It's not this. It's not this hat. And it's not this ring. It's just the salt water. That's it. That's it. We know it's it. No, the hat's even part of it. That's it. My friend did a trick. That is a trick. That is confusing to us. That is not the trick. We're gonna give you this one. A Bright Idea. That's what happens. You put a light bulb in your mouth, You could. But there's another item up there that if you were wearing it, and then you put the Yeah? The light bulb in your hand? Oh, and you had a. And you had salt water in the balloon. What? I don't understand. Put the ring on and then touch No salt water? So it turns out salt water. Also works. Also, the tray is metal. But basically. Let's. But no, there was no metal in my mouth. Yeah, Right. Right. Magic Mike, help us out. I'm so confused. Now, I know you're all just here for the abracadabra, but here's a bright idea. I don't believe it. What? Just touch, touch the side of it. Oh, the side of it. You connect the bottom to the side, or you fill your mouth with salt water and you suck on. It's interesting that you and then it worked. We did a better trick. Come on, now. I'm giving it to you. But we should get points. For inventing a trick. Yep. Points back. Points back. Okay. We'll see where you land in the end. Yes. Are you interested in making your glorious and feel incredible? Well. Yes, you should. At mythical. com, we sell original pomade, and we sell beard balm and beard oil. Yes. This clay pomade is what I currently The original pomade is and the beard balm is oil. So get some at mythical. com. Pomade's beard products. We stand by it. Okay, did a little bit of math. If you use all your lifelines, this round, So we're holding at the Magic boys. Magic boys. And they're two decoys. Your time starts now. So we've got. Four balls. Red balls. Do they bounce? What do they do? We have, we have a card. This is the queen of hearts. We have. Oh. Oh, wow. Are those mags? These are magnets. And then, boy, they are strong. And then. Oh, they really don't want to Wait, it feels so. Do they connect to the coins? And then. Yep. And then we've got some coins that are British in nature. Queen Elizabeth is on them. I don't know where they're from. I think I got it, Link. We do not need these balls. We do not need this card. But we can ask for everything, so. All right. You want to try it? We have pride. Do we? Watch this. We still have that, huh? Watch this, watch this, watch this. Put some showmanship into it, now. Have you ever dropped your coins and thought, I don't want to touch them? Yes, it's magic. Oh, dirty coins. Dirty coins. Don't like to touch the dirty coin. It just looks like your finger is sticky. I got floating coins now. It's magic. Now, that's something. All right, what's the name of this trick? Okay, here we go. What's the name of this trick, it is Financial Equilibrium. We're going to make them float. All right, so hold those apart just Turn them around. Nope. Turn them around, only turn one around. Yeah, I keep doing the same. And then put it, put it vertical right here. And then we're gonna. Gotta get it. Gotta get it in there. Further apart. This is gonna be hard, man. Maybe if I do three. No. I bet you we need. How many decoys? Two. Two. Oh, gosh. There's no way. It's not the magnets and the coins. Right. Can I ask, what about the name of Cause finance. Money. Money. Equilibrium, float. Float. Right? Well, it appears as if the definition Equilibrium, doesn't mean float, but. Okay, well, let's get rid of an item. We can get rid of. Okay, get rid of an item. You do not need the red balls. Yeah, of course we don't. Stevie. So, kids, you see this? If you save your money, You're gonna push that dirty Oh, is that it? Okay, what's the other decoy? Financial Equilibrium. Don't tell us the card. You don't need the playing card. So what we need to. We need to pantomime it. Let's see the pantomime. So, he's holding something, and then he just. He dropped it. He drops it. He's floating the coin by So, can you do that? Okay. Equilibrium, as a word. You've pitched that it's to float things. It mean that it's balanced. Okay. Balanced. Oh, so we're balancing coins on themselves. Whoa, kids, that's impossible. Save your money, children. That's magic. One day, Whoa, Oh, look at that. And I can. And look at. And look, he can pass it to his buddy. He can pass it to his magic buddy. Siskel can pass it to Ebert. What do we do with all the time we have? Can you spin it? Oh, oh. and then do that. You gotta do that. That's it. We did it. We don't have any other lifelines? No. We've been defeated by magic. And it's not the first time. Is that the only way to balance those? Like, what would be a more impressive way? Maybe. Oh, a third one. All three of them. Like this. Like this. Like, how would you do this, kid? And then. Oh, oh, kids. Whoa. Pay no attention to the stack of magnets. Ignore the stack. Come on, come on, come on. Turn it back over. What kind of man can do that? A magic man. And then. Here, take these and put those there, too. Cause it makes it stronger. And now. And now. I mean, kind of. Kind of. Kind of. We'll give it to you. Oh, my goodness. I'm so relieved. Let's see how Magic Mike does it. And now the trick to end all tricks. Financial Equilibrium. What does he do? That was a distraction. So he's not hiding the magnet. He's showing us how to do the trick, Link. Oh, yeah. What? So, all of the magnets are behind the? Okay. And then there's. So he's. He didn't put it through his hand hole, How did he do that? He's acting like he's balancing coins, Oh, because if you just put that If you just put both of them and then you're, past that. Then it's like the No, it doesn't. I just saw him do it, How'd you do it, Trevor? It's a tricky trick. But the good news is, is that you guys have won the together in Good Mythical More. Oh, okay. No, we don't have. No, it's fine. It's fine. We didn't really do it. What? For real? We didn't do it like Magic Mike. He was great. He did it. He did it better. I just love the fact that we have to the world of magic. Yeah.
