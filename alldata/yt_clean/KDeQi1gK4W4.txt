Hi, everyone! I'm cooking a tasty &quot;Apple Bavarian cake&quot;. It's unreally tasty! It resembles me a &quot;Hut&quot; cake. but in a different way. I'll show you how to cook it, how to do it diverse and what is good to substitue apples. I need 1 kg. of any apples. I also need a pan with a thick bottom and a lid. Send 4 table spoons of water into the pan. Peel apples. Cut out the &quot;heart&quot;. Slice them. Send apple slices into the pan. Add sugar on the top of apples. Cover with a lid. Put on fire. At first - big fire. After it starts boiling - reduce the fire. ... for about 15 min. Now we need to make cream The last thing will be the dough. Beat up 2 eggs. Add all sugar. Beat it up for 1-2 min. Add 2 table spoons of flour. Stir it a bit. Mix it. Add 1/3 of milk. Mix it. Add the rest. Mix it. Send mixed milk into the frying pan. Add the rest of milk. ... vanilla... Stir it with a whisk. At first fry on a big fire. 2 min later - reduce it. I cook cream on the slow fire. Don't leave it on the stove. Stir it all time. In a min. cream is about to be ready. I reduced temperature even more. Now you can take a spoon and keep on stirring. Turn off fire and keep it on a hot stove to make it thick. When cream is ready send it into a bowl. Look at the consistancy of the cream. Tips: frying pan makes it faster. But don't leave it on the pan. Stir it all the time. There are no lumps in the cream If there are some - grate it on a fine sieve. The most important: the cream should not stick to the bottom. For that you need to adjust to your stove and your pan. But if it did - grate it on a fine sieve. Eventually - frying make the process 30 min. faster. Let the cream to get cool. My butter has a room temperature. I&quot;ll combine cream and butter. Loot at the apples. Let them stay for 2-3 min. Put them in a bowl to get cool. The cream is cool. Time to beat up butter. Beat it till it gets white. Add cream little by little. We need to wait till apples are cool. Get rid of excessive liquid in apples. Time to make dough Combine flour and butter. You may use margarine but taste will differ. Mix it. Do it the way I do. Add 2 table spoons of sour cream. Mix 1/2 table spoon of soda and 1 table spoon of vinager. Stir it. Add it to the dough. Knead the dough. Do it the way I do it. I don't do it for a long time. Just let it form a lump. And leave it alone for 5 min. You may wrap it with a film. 5 min. later put on the table. Knead it with hands for 3-4 min. The dough is ready. Slice it in 9 even parts. Cover the baking tray with a foil or a parchment paper. Heat the oven at 392 F. Roll each piece of dough in a form I do it. Approx. 20x15 cm. Lay apples on one side. Step a bit from the edge. A good news: you can add into the filling whatever you wish ... nuts, raisins, dried fruit..., ... make a strudel filling... ... plums..., cherries..., ... a tasty combin.: blackberry jelly jam. ... whatever... Cover filling the way I do it. Press edges. Form edges. Put on the frying tray. They look like that. Bake them at 356 F. for 15 min. Cool korzhs put on a wooden base. You may cream the bottom of it. Cream the 1st layer. Korzhs need to be cool. Put the 2d layer. Go on doing till the end. Cover the top and sides with cream. Put into a fridge for 3 hrs. at least. ... 4-5 hrs. is better. 4 hrs. later... Decorate with nuts..., It's better to dry them on the frying pan...or in the oven. ... raisins..., any decoration sticks well to the cream. My favorite combination is apples and nuts. Let's cut it and watch the inside. Here we are! Looks nice! I'm looking forward trying it. Sure it's tasty! If you change filling each time:.. nuts, dried fruit..., ... apricots..., ... you'll have a new cake each time, having the same base. It cuts well. Very tasty. Fresh apples will not make it as tasty as stewed ones. Apples stewed in a pan become like a soft marmalade ... processed from juice... If you don't know there are only apples... ... it gives the impression of pears... Probably it depends on the sort of apples. It's very tender... Tasty... Try it. I do recommend it. It's a tasty cake. Easy to make. It's enough for 12 people. Try it and send feedback. Make it with different filling. Send pics into the Instagram. I do recommend to everyone &quot;Bavarian apple cake&quot;! Thanks for being with me. Make it and you'll be pleased. Click "thumb up"! Share this video. All links are below the video.
