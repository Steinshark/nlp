Our forefathers went out of their way They racked their brains And now in every city a standard where you can see a standard movie. - Do you have oranges? Come to our yearly fair! We have gifts for every taste! Street names Can you name a city that hasn't got Second Suburban Street, First Park Street, Third Builders' Street? Similar stairways are painted standard apartments and nondescript doors are equipped Zhenya, I have an unexpected Really? Please, don't scare me. - Zhenya! Let's usher in the New Year together. Of course, together. No, you don't understand. What do you mean? Let's not go to the Katanyans'. No, Galya, it won't look good. They're my friends. And you've I love crabmeat.

Does it mean that you're going after we've known each other No, let's wait After the Kremlin clock chimes. I'm just afraid Well, that's... That's the cowardice You know, once I already proposed And to my great surprise, But when I thought Day after day... she would be To and fro, to and fro... I couldn't take it, Are you going to run away from me, No, no one can run away from you! I've decided I held out... Zhenya, - When do people sing? Well, during manifestations. - And besides that? - No, not that... - You know, silly, when they sing? - When, then? Right. I'm alone, no one's expected But the falling gray twilight. A winter day's dimly projected Through the curtains open wide. Only white, moist, fluffy snow Glimpses fleetingly sideways, Only roofs and snow below, Nothing comes and nothing stays. And again the frost's aggression, And again I become a goad Of the last year's depression With the other winter's load. Suddenly the curtain's wrapping Will be stirred by some in-come. Biding silence by your stepping, Biding silence by your stepping You'll appear like time to come. At the door you'll stand for real, All in white, with no pretense, Clad in kind of the material For which flakes make lots of sense. I'm alone, no one's expected But the falling gray twilight. A winter day's grimly projected Through the curtains open wide. - Maria Dmitriyevna! Season's greetings - Why are you yelling? - Mother, who is it? - What's up? But I'm leaving for Leningrad today.

Well, let's say goodbye to The year when I met you. And I met you. I love the New Year celebrations! Nadya. What? Nadenka, I want to ask you... Do me a small favor. Here... I love hearing you sing. You're just biased. Yes, I am. I'm very much biased. Along my street, now for many years Sound the steps. My friends leave The lingering departure of my friends Is welcomed by the darkness outside. O Loneliness! Your nature's so tough. By making sparkling compasses' You're closing the circle cold and Not listening to useless exhortations. Let me tiptoe in your wood, On that far end of measured gesture, Discover leaves, experience their And, being orphaned, feel majestic. Give me the silence of a library hall, The solemn melodies of your concertos, And, sapient, I'll forget those all Who are gone and still alive, but yet And I'll cognize both wisdom and The objects will confide their latent And Nature, leaning on my shoulders, The secrets of her childhood dreaming. And then, from tears, from the dark, From poor ignorance of yore, Of friends of mine so beautiful a mark Will come in sight, then meltjust as Of friends of mine so beautiful a mark Will come in sight, then meltjust as - Whose verses are these? What would you like? - Salad. And roast beef, too. Nadya, listen to me. Tonight, in the last hour I intend to put I think that we...

At the bathhouse we drank to - Are you an alcoholic? I drink only tea, coffee... Buttermilk, you know, Excuse us. Please, Ippolit, keep your cool, I'm absolutely cool. After the bathhouse There we drank again. And I think that, instead of Pavlik, I swear, it's all very simple. And looks very truthful, too. In the plane? - Flew? - Sleeping? Well, suppose you don't remember But you must remember Yes, I must. But I don't remember anything. Though I remember I told the driver my home address, All right, suppose your key worked... Nadenka, please... The key worked But you must have noticed - It's the same furniture. Didn't you see that the apartment was My mother and I moved in only three That's it.
