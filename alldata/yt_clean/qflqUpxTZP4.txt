- I can't wait to show you guys this. It's finally here, my diamond play button. You're probably thinking to yourself, &quot;Gee, Linus, you have like How did it take you so long to make a video about That is because this is like no other diamond play button. Guys, this is mother This diamond play button Vincero wants to give you a chance to buy stylish watches Use the link in the description plus free shipping on your entire order for Vincero's spring upgrade sale. (dice clinking) (upbeat music) Step one of building your very is, of course, getting The process is super simple. All you have to do is get you, 9,999,999 of your friends, to all subscribe to the Then you request your and they send it in the mail. By the way, guys, thanks Step two, finding a PC that will fit in a diamond play button. The X Y dimensions, actually but the Z height is not that thick by the time you factor in cooling. So we went with this Intel NUC. It's got support for an M.2 SSD, up to two slots of SODIMM memory, and this right here is a Core i7-10710U. Now, going with 10th Gen, we do give up Intel's But, what we gain in return is six cores and, with this particular model, the ability to go real fast if we can provide adequate cooling. And, the reality of it is, guys, is if we really wanted out of this thing, we would use an external So this feels like a great choice. Massive shout out, by the way, to Simply NUC for sending They do sell this and many Usually they look more so you'll have to check that out. Man, the job they did on this thing is- - [Alex] Oh yeah. - It's beautiful. Like, are these beveled edges? - [Alex] Oh yeah. There's - [Linus] This is unreal craftsmanship. But, we'll get more into that later. For now, I wanna show you So you see these four It's just going to go a And the reason that we off the bottom of the play button is because that's gonna give us room to kind of jam our cables down there, and also give us enough over to this heat sink. IL access is right there. See that? - [Alex] Ooh, this is cool. - [Linus] Pretty much you guys today, by the way, I because Alex did this project So, this appears to be my CPU cold plate. - [Alex] Yep. - And then these are presumably... wow, that's a snug boy fit isn't it? I mean, that's good for, you know, thermal transfer and all that. But these are heat pipes. (Linus exclaiming) Okay, so I'm gonna screw this - Well, first you need to And you asked for us to solder them. I don't know if you still - How much work is it to solder them? The thing about solder is that it needs to melt onto the surfaces that you're trying to bond. And the thing about heat pipes is that it's designed to So, heating up a heat pipe enough at the point where without heating up the that it explodes, is a bit of a tricky matter. We've never really - Yeah, we should be able to do with that. - OK, smooth flow solder paste. - [Alex] It's low temp, may be possible. - [Linus] Let's do it. Before we actually put there's three more smaller use just to spread the heat So the idea here is that carrying the heat from to these heat pipes, which Now we probably could but we're going to add a fan too so this thing is going to We hope. It's never actually I've never soldered a heat pipe before. - Basically just rough it up with a little bit of scotch brite. - [Linus] Is this kind of like a less is more situation - [Alex] I'm not totally sure but you know that it flows - [Linus] And this is what people use for soldering heat pipes. I'm sure that I'm doing - [Alex] Is what I was - [Linus] Here we go. So... I mean hey, the good news is it's kind of like lubey Well no, it goes in a little easier. Alex, am I even sort of doing this the way you're supposed to? 'Cause that would be really good to know. Like, in the video where they did they at all show you how to put it on? - [Alex] They kind of just put it on and put the heat pipes in. - [Linus] Well, I - [Alex] It didn't look like this. (both laughing) - [Linus] Okay, I think they're in. So theoretically this will melt and it will solder this to this. Oh wow, look at it go. Holy (bleep), I think it's working. - [Alex] Oh yeah, damn. - [Linus] I wish I had applied but we won't really see it. - [Alex] It shows on the flare that it's above 130 degrees Celsius. I guess it's high as this goes. - [Linus] I mean, that looks - [Alex] If you want, we in the other heat pipes since but I think that'll take way longer. - [Linus] Yeah, I think - [Alex] Okay. - [Linus] I think this we've done in a long time. It's the Linus ego build. - [Alex] I think that - [Linus] I'm going to be Kind of spreads like We're doing two things right now. We're heating this up to And then we're also heating out the plastic or whatever - [Alex] Oh wait, we basically - Oh, because it's too shiny. - [Alex] Yeah it's way too shiny. - You know what would be great is if we put a piece of 'cause we really do kind of I think a little bit what's the temperature of the tape? - [Alex] Tape's 106 degrees. So yeah, you must be good. Let's also pop out the - [Linus] Don't touch this, hey? - [Alex] Yeah. - [Linus] It's a little toasty. Okay. Oh, it's out. It is way deeper than I thought it was. - [Alex] Yeah. That's one of the reasons to find a PC to fit in. - [Linus] While I wait I can go ahead and remove Oh, that's leaving a nasty residue. Unfortunately we had no for our thermal camera to be of this reflective surface we had to put something which actually leads How on earth did we CNC without a CAD model? Well you can't. So we had to get one. Now the most obvious way ask YouTube for it, I mean they designed it so they and they do. But unfortunately allow our contact to send it to us for the purposes of So we had to 3D scan it, which guys, is no mean feat because is they bounce light off of in order to get all of and, oh no, this thing How do you 3D scan a curved mirror? You give it to a professional. So we enlisted the help of and Omid over there, I but it fricking worked This is the raw scan file. How... (laughs) I don't even. This should be cooled down now so we can test if these are in. Oh! Ow it's still hot, but okay. Oh balls, does it do aluminum? Because it seems like adhere to the aluminum. After further research, it appears that our NC191LT50 for aluminum and copper. So we roughed up the aluminum again put a little bit more of it on this time and we're going to see Otherwise we're going to or thermal epoxy. Actually I think it, I think it- - [Alex] Wow. Oh, heck yeah. Ha! Woo! - [Alex] While that cools, there's two things that we can do. We need to put IO in here. This needs the chop. - [Alex] We're going to just Oh, we need to solder the front - [Linus] Where the hell is - [Alex] Well, we kind wherever we want because but I can go like here or here or here. - [Linus] What do you want for colors? I'm thinking I'll just do like a rainbow. - [Alex] Sure. Hey Linus. - I just realized something. The WiFi antennas are Should we take those out and put them in like a spot they might work? - Yeah, I would like to have WiFi. - For the IO, we didn't want to cut it into the actual play button because for one it's just And also, like, if you you're kind of just screwed. So instead, sorry Simply NUC, but the thing that you (tools scraping) - And pencils down. Are you done? - [Alex] Yeah I'm just - Well, I did a really good job. I don't even need shrink wrap. - [Alex] I think you should - Can you please appreciate and I probably don't need it? - You did a good job Actually I just realized something. We should probably add some to this because otherwise install this power button and that board at the same - [Linus] Oh. We just take some of these male and female little pluggy chummies, solder them on to there so then when we want to put it together we just... - [Linus] So really I soldered So I'm doing completely a wire to another wire. - [Alex] Well, but now you to that wire and it'll be not that hard. - Yeah, just, I could have And then the connector would - [Alex] Eh, details. So we now have to properly decide where this power button is going to go. - [Linus] Oh, this is real final isn't it? - [Alex] Yeah. That diamond cut out, that looks so cool. - [Alex] Oh yeah, it looks so sick. Especially with the fan underneath it. Where exactly do we want this? - [Linus] I dunno like here? You want it up here? I thought we said it was - [Linus] How about like here? - [Alex] Here? (Alex hums) - Dude why did you ask me to pick and then tell me it's Put it wherever the hell you want, I don't even care anymore. (drill running) I like this. (drill running) That's a nice hole. - [Linus] Check this out. We're fricking good to go boys. Oh God. Wow, that's really tight. That is actually a really never seen before and I love it. - [Alex] Wait you've never - [Linus] Okay, that worked perfectly. Is this it, do we assemble? This is what we're using. Light up your wonderful life. - [Linus] And then we're using this and the fan's also being powered by this. - [Linus] Wait, what? Why? - [Alex] Because the NUC and there wasn't a five in here correctly. Put it there, tape it or hot glue it. You take the next one, tape it or hot glue it. that looks horrendous. - Well we could also have done a completely custom solution. - This is faster. - Yes. - There's only one way to know for sure. if these strips will bond to cyanoacrylate and that's to use my finger One unfortunate thing we is that although the play and YouTube actually polished aluminum and nothing else, it has actually been electroplated in copper and then chrome. So what that meant was we polished the aluminum it could never have the same as the rest of the play button. I do think that the cutout diamond looks absolutely sick though. - Crap, even this epoxy came off. Nothing sticks to these stupid things. Look, it's not that we wanted - [Alex] So we wanted and tuck tape. - [Linus] We didn't ask for this. (Linus gasping) How frickin' awesome does that look? We don't actually need this much of this adhesive to keep But what we're doing is trying to ensure that we have a consistent look to this shiny piece that goes under it. So we're covering the entire thing. (Bleep) it, I see what you mean about it being hard to get it like center. (grunts) - [Alex] Ugh, jeez Linus. - [Linus] You know what? We're rolling with it, Alex. - [Alex] So this is going to go here. - [Linus] We could like spend but I really don't think And you're sure this USB for everything that I've plugged into it? - [Alex] Uh, pretty sure. - [Linus] I guess that's That should be fine. Yeah, okay. Honestly, I think we can - [Alex] I'm down. - [Linus] Yeah, like that's awesome. - [Alex] That's not going anywhere. - In a perfect world I for where we're crossing the truth is we don't know how So at least this allows and validate the concept. This thing's sick. 32 gigs RAM. Well, it's not perfect by any stretch. I mean, for extra credit, to these little tiny USB headers and put like an RGB controller in But honestly, I am super happy with what I think is Are we ready to close it up? - [Alex] I think so, yeah. - [Linus] Fan's in. Computer's in, the IO looks amazing. Oh my God, that looks so sick. Man, been planning this build since before we even had This is freaking incredible. Check out that IO, David. Is that clean or what? Alex, you did a great job of that. - [Alex] That is custom built. (smooth funky music) Let's get hardware and fill up here. Get Cinebench up. Oh my God. This is so freaking cool. My computer is a play button and my play button is a computer. Okay. We ready? Minimum test duration, CPU multi-core here we go. Are you rolling on this right now? Because our load temps Mind you, you know, we're maxing because this is a U-class It's a play button. How quiet is it though? Oh, it's whisper-quiet. Oh my God, this thing Alex, you did an amazing job on this. This is nucking futs. Get it, get it. I don't even care that the That just adds character at this point. What I want to know is Okay, CPU single core. Man, you could game on We are getting four Hold on a second. No no, hold on, hold on. Don't turn that off yet. We were hitting like 4.3, 4.44... We touched 4.5 for a second there. I think there were some background app updates that were man when this thing's gaming with like external GPU or something it's gonna be a freaking beast. I love it. And you know what else I love. I was going to segue to our I know it took a while for but thank you very much. 10 million subscribers is accomplishment that we And we really appreciate guys do to make this possible. And we also appreciate our sponsor. The Drop ENTR keyboard is a made, of course, with high-grade It's got an aluminum top so you can read the It's got double shot PBT key caps and weighs in at 964 grams so it's heavy enough to but not so heavy that with you on the go, thanks to its 10-keyless layout. It's available in three colors with your choice of mechanical switches. So don't wait, buy it today at the link in the video description. I feel like normally when people do their 10 million subscriber videos there's a lot of like soul heartfelt talking at their audience. But the truth is, I think of that for like four YouTubers So you guys can go watch that, to see how I feel about all of that. Today is just about being (bleep) cool. Like that's a computer. Ooh
