- Good morning guys, right on the border with Mexico. And in recent times there's coming over this border. But what is this situation like now? What is it compared to So, today we're gonna who's been in office here for a decade, who's gonna walk us and his understanding of the situation. Let's do this. All right, sheriff, where are we going? - Well, we'll hit the remote part first and then we'll get back into town. Or, we can do vice versa, - Where's the more interesting part? - Well, it's all interesting. - Okay, let's do remote. (Sheriff laughing) - That's where all the people are dying. So, Yuma County, 5,500 square miles. I got 95 deputies that patrol all of this. - Okay. - 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The cartels have designated they allow people to cross. Then the cartels also that they control, where And those that do not are also guided through. Anybody that crosses the border here, is paying anywhere from $6,000 It all depends on what So, those that are coming Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, the Ukraine, they're paying more to get here. - You're getting migrants - Oh yeah, 140 different countries. You figure this last federal just on the river corridor, there were over 310,000 and processed by Border Patrol Agents. And then out in the in the remote desert, there's over 28,000 getaways There could be more. That's the impact for which is either the second, or third smallest Border for US Border Patrol. So, they're running maybe 800 agents, that had to handle over 310,000 people. There's the border right there. - [Peter] Where? Oh, the fence is up there? - [Sheriff] Yeah. - What I was told in South Texas, was the fence isn't gonna stop anyone. 32 foot fence, 33 foot But it makes it easier for to deal with it because they on the fence. - You can see where people to go over whatever. - Is that your understanding? - It's a deterrent. And yes, they do use ladders, you have sensors, it does slow down so that Border Patrol can to be able to apprehend it. And it keeps individuals When most people hear Yuma, Arizona, they think of desert. What you need to understand the whole of the United States, 90% of your winter leafy greens. When you have these gaps in it's just an open area and This is one of the crossing And there's where it impacts our farmers, because those individuals and defecating and the As a farmer because of food safety, you can't harvest that area. It's now contaminated. - [Peter] What do they do? - They just have to plow it under. So where we're at here is Morelos Dam, obviously United States. Mexico, right across the river. Cartels designated this as So, you can see where that pickup is at, there's a little road that goes down. So, they get off at the airport, Mexicali, take their Uber, bus. - Get get off at the airport? - Yeah. They all fly into Mexicali. Everybody that's coming - They're not doing the long hard journey, through the country? They're flying in. Some of these countries... They have to manipulate or not that country requires a visa. Some of the Russians were and other countries to make Then spend a couple weeks in Cabo, and then they would fly into Mexico City, then into Mexicali. So, all these different they're all educated enough to figure out how to get from airport, - [Peter] So- this area of the river corridor from here, between here and about eight miles. - [Peter] You guys down here were putting storage containers, right? - Right, the governor... - To block the gaps here? They pulled all the finally this administration they need to finish the amount, sheer amount in volume of people coming in here illegally. - [Peter] So, this fence is - They're supposed to be contracted out to put in the rest of this And I'll show you that out. So, they just walk off the bus, walk down that little trail right there, come across right here. So, you're not even getting wet. - [Peter] And then who gets 'em here, on the Arizona side? - Border Patrol. - That's so interesting. So, they wanna get caught. - Oh yeah, it's what we call give ups. These are individuals that those countries won't take 'em back. - [Peter] The Russians - No. - [Peter] Okay, so once they- - Well, they claim an asylum, because they're coming Okay. So, once they get in, - Takes them in. - Processes them. - And then they have an - Well, they're given a notice to appear, wherever they're going in the US. You gotta have a sponsor. - [Peter] Okay. - And I picked up pieces of paper showing addresses within the Wisconsin, New Jersey, where that's where they're going. - [Peter] What's your understanding of the backlog right now, when they have to appear in that state? - Before this administration as we understood it, was Because, they had over 11 million illegals that were still pending, hearing. - [Peter] He's going to Mexico. - [Sheriff] Oh sh*** - [Peter] Holy sh** (people shouting) (Sheriff speaking in a foreign language) - [Agent] I think he went that way. - Okay, the one guy went through the gap. This guy's swimming right now. - [Sheriff] See him? He just went into the reeds. Literally, guys, we've been down here, just 10 minutes, or so. Wow. - [Sheriff] He's still walking that way. - [Agent] Is he on land? - [Sheriff] No, he is on the water. - [Sheriff] Yeah, I'm watching him. You gonna get the other one? Just two? - [Sheriff] Okay. - [Peter] So, I thought it would've been a nighttime thing, but it's all the time. So, these are the ones - [Peter] So, this guy will go back, hide in the reeds, wait a while? And then, he'll come back. - [Peter] He doesn't - [Sheriff] No. - [Peter] Why doesn't - Probably, 'cause he is or he's got a criminal history. You just heard him laughing. He thinks it's funny. It's all a game. - [Peter] It's just cat and mouse. - [Sheriff] Yeah. - [Peter] It looks like a pretty big jump he's about to do. Ah, not too bad. It's hard to explain guys. A very surreal part of the country. And until you see it firsthand, I know the video does but here's the opportunity. And many people want the opportunity. Very understandable. (car engine revving) Why, wouldn't you want to I mean, like I've always said, I would do the same thing or in a terrible situation. I would go for the US, but as an American, I want the legal process to be respected. - [Sheriff] Well.. - And we should know everyone Right? - [Sheriff] He's coming up beside you. - [Agent] Did you see - [Sheriff] Yeah, he's going... he's already over and working his way up towards the other side. - [Peter] You sprinted pretty hard there. - I did, I'm out of breath. I need to start making - [Sheriff] Did you catch the other one? - Yeah, the second one was - [Sheriff] Oh, was he? Okay. (Sheriff laughing) - [Sheriff] Well at least he caught Yeah, I get it. But I mean, let me ask you something. What's the threshold? - [Peter] Oh. - Right there is a threshold. We cannot afford to take other countries' issues. - Right. - I mean, right now you look being spent each and every day, by this administration dealing with this. So, you look at one tent just a sleep in it is - What do you mean? Oh, one of these big tents facilities? - One of these big tents $4.5 million. Now the other tents, are about $6.5 million because that's where they and feed the folks. And then you look at laundry services, so they And the fact that Border has to buy food and clothing When does it stop? It's $15-$16 million a month, for HHS just to deal with that come across. That's your tax dollar, or mine. - But we don't have any So, we have plenty of money to spend. (Peter laughing) - Well, if you live in a bubble, But we deal with reality here. We got it all figured out here. (Sheriff laughing) No issues in America. - Because there's so many coming across and they were going out and defecating and littering. The county had to put up these porta johns at certain locations, so that they wouldn't go out in the fields and contaminate the farm fields. Why is the county having to pay that bill? - [Peter] Right. has already said that immigration is their sole responsibility. Right? They've said that. Why aren't they paying their bills? There are things in law enforcement, called ethics, integrity. I don't get that outta Mayorkas at all. - [Peter] Okay, and for those that don't - He's the Secretary of Homeland Security. His sole responsibility is the safety And he's failing miserably. So, here's all the fencing. - [Peter] Okay. - That's just been sitting here. All this fencing that was just sitting there collecting dust. You're down here now? (Sheriff laughing) - [Sheriff] I was showing where they're cutting the - [Peter] They're cutting - Oh, they'll use the 'cause they use the battery operated. - [Security agent] Angle grinder. And then they'll cut the metal and then they have to 'cause each one of those Stay safe brother. - [Security agent] You too. (Sheriff laughing) - [Peter] Okay, so... Someone might but they can cut a hole in it. So, why have the fence? - Again, it's A, a deterrent. - B... The amount of time it takes - [Peter] Yeah. the ability to come So, when you see parts of the fence that have that patch on it. - [Peter] Okay, right there? - [Sheriff] That's where they and that's allowed them the ability to swing that fence post. - [Peter] Okay. - [Sheriff] So, they can get through. And you see there's a walkway all along the side of this fence. I've actually intercepted And I got the one finger wave, - [Peter] Can you do Border Patrol has to do it? [Sheriff] Border Patrol has to do it. Arizona had 1070 law and that allowed us to charge But the Obama administration It took 'em to court. Supreme Court said, &quot;Yes, you're right. &quot;Federal responsibility is immigration. Smuggling is part of that. So, Arizona, you cannot So, if we detain anybody for technically we can get charged by the Department of Figure that one out. Even if our officers respond and we find a house full of There's nothing that we can knowingly that they are smuggling. Now, we can try to get if they have people to respond. But that's in Yuma. All the rest of the places they don't have access to Border Patrol, or HSI to come take the case. - [Peter] What's the you're seeing these days? - [Sheriff] Right now... I think the top ones is Ecuador, then Columbia. - [Peter] What's with OTM? Have you heard of that, - Yeah, they've used that That's what all these are. I mean, you don't see a from Mexico proper trying to come across, 'cause they'll get returned immediately, because there's that So, when you look at people that's where they're able to those countries. 95% of what comes across These are individuals that where that government - [Peter] Are there cartels operating much on this side of the border in Yuma? Are you dealing with them? - They're on both sides. It's safer for them to live over here. Think about it. So, you do have members of the cartel, that live in the US, all along the border. You have sicarios that - [Peter] Sicarios? - Hitmen. - [Peter] Okay. - Those are what the cartels use to take out their opponents, let's say. So, you have major narcotics MS13 is is one that everybody's familiar here with, well that's why they're integrated because they work with the cartels, not only the narcotics side, but the human side as well. Because, if you can't then you are going to Human trafficking. So, they're gonna pay according So, if you got a kid, they may use that kid to send 'em back to that country, portray a family unit. You may end up with- - [Peter] Portray a family unit... 'cause if you come in as a family unit... - You have quicker access So, we're coming up on and in Arizona, tribal And the Cocopah is a River People. So, they need access to the river, because that's part of their.... - [Peter] So, on their tribal - There's no fence. There are bollards, or we call 'em Normandy barriers. And that's used to keep the individuals that were smuggling narcotics. - [Peter] Okay. in vehicles and UTVs. But again, here's the porta Border Patrol had to put - [Peter] So, this is - Yep. So, to give you an idea of the monstrosity that we're dealing with here, Some NGOs have come in But what I would find down here is, all these identification I picked all these up myself. - [Peter] Just in the dirt out here? - Just on the ground. And we might find some again today. But see, these are individuals, that have fled countries of violence, then gone to another country, That's what a lot of these green ones are. They've been allowed to and work and live. But that's not what their Their original intent was to get to the United States. So, they discard their and they portray themselves from their original country of violence. So, it's a game. So, we share all this with HSI. So, every one of these our federal government. But this is just a small snapshot, of what I've picked up down here as far as passports. if you're from Venezuela, right? Let me try to walk through this, right? You come over, you come You wanna discard your - [Sheriff] Yeah, because - Okay, what happens if you they're gonna say? - Well, for some now, - Some are allowed to stay. - Yeah. - But those individuals have already reestablished residency somewhere else. - So, maybe it's a Venezuelan for five years. - Or a year. - Or a year, okay. - And their ultimate goal was to get here. - Right, I read a lot of say this last summer, or whenever - Yeah. - A lot of 'em lived in Not even Haiti. - [Sheriff] Oh yeah. But they haven't even been - [Sheriff] No. So, here's where it ends. - [Sheriff] So, here's where the fencing ends. And this is the tribal So, you have the Cocopah tribal land, which is sacred sovereign land. You get some border challenge coins. Look right here. See what I was telling you about? They tossed their money. So, this is all money. They know when they get here, - [Peter] Here's a euro. - [Sheriff] Yeah, so. - [Sheriff] Go ahead and pick 'em up. - [Peter] We have a euro. - [Sheriff] Don't throw it back down, - [Peter] What is that? - [Sheriff] I'll put it in my package. - [Peter] It's a peso. You're a coin collector now, sheriff. - [Sheriff] Well, I use it for display. Display purposes. - [Peter] What coins have you seen? Like what are the most - [Sheriff] Well, I'm waiting (Sheriff laughing) - [Peter] We're looking for - [Sheriff] Anybody I bring down here... Well, you missed a bunch. You see right here? They tear up their IDs, - [Peter] Okay. - [Sheriff] They'll tear up because they don't wanna get caught. - [Peter] Chile. There's some more right there. See, look, you're missing a lot of money. - [Peter] More euros. This is crazy. - [Sheriff] When I bring- - [Peter] What a wild, I but what a wild part of the world. We're right here. - [Peter] Yuma County. Then the Natives control this land. - [Sheriff] Right. - [Peter] We have euros in the dirt. - [Sheriff] Yeah. - And Russians and 140 nationalities getting through here, in - [Sheriff] Oh yeah. Here's some more right here, look. See? More IDs tore apart. - [Peter] Okay, so they - [Sheriff] See, if you put this together, it'll have all the information you need. - [Peter] So, why do they Why don't they just do - [Sheriff] Lord only knows. - [Peter] Toothbrushes. - [Sheriff] Yeah. - [Peter] So, it's not But that's the last thing on their minds, obviously trying to get - Yeah, they don't care. I mean, you look at some of this trash, I can show you pictures where, all of this is just covered But luckily an NGO came because they knew senators were coming. And because the senators are coming, you gotta sanitize before they get here, to make it look like there's - [Peter] 'Cause you come "Ah, there's no issue", there's no one trying to get over. - [Sheriff] Yeah. - [Peter] But you're saying it pulses, like you have the tent set up there. You had a big rush here. Now, it's somewhere else. - [Sheriff] Now it's moved. - We had the guy that we ran - [Sheriff] Yeah. - [Peter] This guy's got a full ID here. - [Sheriff] Oh, look, there's - [Peter] This guy's from China. - [Sheriff] Yeah. That's what I'm saying. - [Peter] I'm gonna be devil's advocate for one second, ready? - [Sheriff] Go right ahead. - Just go along with me here. - [Peter] We're a country of immigrants. - [Sheriff] Right. - [Peter] We all came from somewhere. - [Sheriff] Right. - And we need immigration. - [Sheriff] Correct. - We need a workforce. - [Sheriff] Okay. We need talent, we need work. But like you said before, like how much can you take? And everyone has a threshold as in like, they're living in their house. - And all of a sudden they had 300 people show up on their front lawn, they would've reached So, what is that threshold? Maybe that's the big question, which nobody can really agree on, right? - [Sheriff] Well, you have these "We need to fix our immigration" "We need to fix our Why don't we have a change Because they can't get together on it. So, what do they do? They create a crisis to take that they can't do their job. - [Peter] What's the crisis? - Immigration, COVID, you name it. - [Peter] Here's another Euro. - [Sheriff] Oh cool. - [Peter] Did you ever see as many euros down here, euro coins? Or is that a new thing? - No, I got, oh look, there's a whole ID. - [Sheriff] Nigeria? Where's that one? - [Peter] Peru. - [Peter] Oh look, more. - [Peter] Jesus. - [Sheriff] See, they don't.. - [Peter] So, they find it easier over here, obviously? - [Sheriff] Well, yeah, you Look, here's some more. It's blowing right at you. - [Peter] It's snowing currency. - [Sheriff] You know how much... - [Peter] Too bad this - [Sheriff] Well over there it is. - [Peter] So the Cocopah fence is just to show that's where the border, obviously that doesn't stop anything? - Well, that was actually put into place to deter the tractor thefts and the stolen vehicles taken into Mexico. The tractors were obviously down deep in Mexico. But the cars were turned and then they would drive back across with large loads of narcotics. So, that's why all that It was like a vehicle the tribe's ability to get to the river. Now that we're down here welcome to Jurassic Park. So, please keep your hands and your limbs inside the vehicle at all times. Because I don't want you to- - [Peter] You have a garage door opener for the fence, is that - [Sheriff] For the gate, yeah. - [Peter] This is still the US right? - [Sheriff] Yeah, this is all US. - Welcome to Mexico [chuckle] Like I'm gonna be carrying guns in Mexico. They'd love that right now. - So, what do we have here, burnt wire? What's the point of that? - [Sheriff] Well, they were keeping warm, so they burned anything - [Peter] Isn't setting a fire here is just like a basic sign - Well, they got a camera But they're just waiting for Border Patrol to have the resources to come pick 'em up. What is that right there? - [Peter] Yeah. Here we got a Cuba... - [Sheriff] We gotta work on - [Peter] I know, but this is the hard detail... -Well, you're supposed to pick it up. - Oh, sorry, I forgot. I'm your Trivette. You're Walker Texas Ranger, I'm Trivette. (both laughing) How does it make you feel Do you become numb, or because you love your country? Or, what does that feel like for you? - I feel bad for the rest we're all gonna have to deal with this. Your community's gonna pay the price for what this administration's doing of not enforcing the rule of law. The bottom line is to you have to go to a port of entry. Claim asylum at a port of entry, that is the law. I get the fact that a don't like the immigration law. Well, fix it and change it. But until then, you need It worked. We've seen it through when we were only getting a day in Yuma county proper versus over a thousand a day now. This administration, and personal and political ideologies, stopped all that because who actually supported law enforcement. And the people of this that this is coming into their backyard. This person's gonna be in their backyard, under a different name. And you don't know what this guy's got. I've run into doctors, I've run into lawyers from I've run into school teachers. They're straight up with you, But then you have the others And why? Is this a child molester? Is this a murderer? What kind of crimes has he done in that country that he fled? That's a question that would want to know. But yet, because of the we're probably never gonna because somebody's gonna get hurt. That's what's great about When you've worked in that they know you. It's one thing that I tell every officer, that goes through an academy, never, ever in your career or your ethics, 'cause you can never get that back. So.. - [Peter] You've been here for how long in law enforcement? - Well, I started as a reserve when I was in the Marine For all you mathematicians out there, how many years was that? - [Peter] We're coming up on almost 40. - 38. - [Peter] In two years, yeah. - We're given a gift and do something that's So, I enjoy the fact that I can go out and do things that most - [Peter] Okay, so - [Sheriff] No, these are illegals. - [Peter] Seriously? - [Peter] Can we cruise by 'em? - [Sheriff] Yeah, we're gonna. So, the cartels are collecting their money down here under this bridge. So, that bridge is actually in Mexico. But there is nothing between us and there, other than this fence. - Wow, so they're super casual and look like they're walking or something. children, infants. - [Peter] So you wave to them. - Why not? - [Peter] So you have with these people coming in? - Well, I'm not here to... It doesn't matter where they're from. - [Peter] Yeah. - We still have a duty and responsibility as far as public safety goes. Some of these people have been victimized. The children have been taken because they were violated You don't know what's happened to them, or where they're from. You're welcome to talk to 'em if you want to. - Find out where they're - [Peter] Yeah, yeah. - Hola. - De donde eres - Ecuador? - Colombia? - [Peter] Buenos dias. - [Peter] Buenos dias. - [Sheriff] Ecuador. - [Sheriff] Where are you going in the US? - [Peter] California, New York? - [Sheriff] California. - [Peter] New York? - [Peter] But don't do this anymore, no more... No mas... Estados Unidos. Por favor. Gracias. Buena suerte. - [Man] Gracias. - [Sheriff] Another one. (Sheriff laughing) Zoom in right under - [Peter] Okay. - [Sheriff] So, that's where and then they'll point - [Peter] So, the cartels - [Sheriff] Yeah. - [Peter] Do they ever - Oh yeah. We actually had some individual Border Patrols doing special detail. 'Cause we were having going on out here, because the criminal knows that these folks have money. So, as the cartels, we got 'em across, another criminal group would to take all their money and their jewelry. So, Border Patrol was doing and got an actual shootout One died in the US soil, so But that happens down here quite a bit, along this area because it's so lucrative. I mean it's a cash crop per se. - [Peter] Every one of is what $6,000? - [Peter] $7,000-$8,000. So, it's quick money. - [Peter] The cartels don't wanna Like they wouldn't fire a bullet over? - Oh they probably would. (Peter laughing nervously) - [Peter] Should we get in the car? - I mean it's something Trust me, if they start shooting 'cause that's still the US. And they know that local law enforcement doesn't tolerate it. If you get caught over They already know that here. And they know that over there. The Feds might let them get away with it, but local law enforcement will not. So, yeah... (Peter exhales) - [Peter] I'll tell these people Amigos. Agua. Okay, you got. - This place will be full of people. They usually have 'em And here's why they do that. They will inundate Border Patrol with large groups of So, it ties up Border Patrol's and takes them away from out east, so they can get their narcotics and the other humans smuggling for those that don't want to - [Peter] So yeah, the clothes, like new white clothes, the backpack looks pretty new. Not dirty. They didn't do a hard journey. - [Sheriff] No. - And so how it works is You're gonna call back home and you're gonna say to your friends, or relatives gonna be saying, &quot;Hey, here's how you do it. &quot;It's pretty easy right now&quot;. - [Sheriff] Yep. - It just encourages more. - Yeah. They're coming here to better their life. I get that. But, they need to do it the legal way. I'm also a public safety servant. Anybody in my county, we respond to help. We've handled over 780, that were left abandoned needing help. - [Peter] 780 last year or? - Yeah. If we end up with somebody that has a medical condition down here, that takes away that EMS resource, from that community to Federal government isn't reimbursing them. Our deputies working on overtime, much like the rest of try to fill the gap for Border Patrol, because they're tied up with this. We've taken over 70 death investigations out in the remote desert, because people died out there, because they were (door beeping) You're right here in San Luis, Arizona. That's San Luis, Mexico. Right across the fence. So, what the cartels will do, is they will have a large that don't want to get caught. They will utilize those ladders to get up the fence and cross over. Border Patrol has to but unfortunately you're so that they don't catch 'em all. So, they do end up in these neighborhoods and that's part of the impact - [Peter] How do these neighborhoods feel? - Well, they don't care for that. They don't want it in their backyard, anymore than you'd want - [Peter] But there're probably some stash houses out here, right? - Oh there are. I mean, right up here is the old Kentucky Fried Chicken building, where we had the most recent - [Peter] Drug tunnel? - Drug tunnel. - [Peter] Into the Kentucky Fried Chicken? - [Sheriff] Yeah. (Peter chuckles) So, came up into the kitchen. - The drug tunnel went under the fence. - Under the canal... Kentucky Fried Chicken to another guy. It was owned privately, because a guy was going to turn It wasn't operating at that time. - [Sheriff] Right. So, they built a tunnel and they ended up tunneling And it was a small opening, because it was all hard narcotics. So, we're talking methamphetamine. - [Peter] So, no one - Oh they were, they were But the hole in the floor was small. - [Peter] Do you think they'll make it (Peter laughing) - [Sheriff] Hard to say. - [Peter] They're quite ambitious. It could happen. - [Sheriff] You gotta be to be able to plot depth and everything else, to get all the way over That's millions of dollars. And you see that pinkish - [Peter] Yeah. - Right across the street was Not US postal, but a packaging company. That's where the other tunnel came across, is right out there. So, it went underneath all that up there. - So, what percentage of tunnels do you think are not getting discovered that are currently in operation? - [Sheriff] I'm sure there's quite a few. - [Peter] Plenty of 'em, right? Right now a big thing for us down here dealing with is drones. You got a drone that Fentanyl don't weigh much right? So, you can get a big have a drone come across and their GPS controlled to a certain location and they'll drop it in a neighborhood and then they'll fly back. - And just so you guys all unlike most police officers, unlike Customs and Border Protection, they cannot speak on camera, correct? - They're not gonna speak like you do. - No, they have to get Like Chiefs of Police, they have to get authorization and their city managers. - And they're gonna speak They're not really gonna 'cause that could Whereas sheriffs, you're not accountable to anybody. Is that correct? - Well, I'm accountable and that's the community of Yuma. - And one of the very cool is you can do a ride along. Like, technically this is a ride along. I go to the sheriff's office, I can fill out paperwork and - [Sheriff] Yeah. - To understand what you guys do. - And you can do that with your local law enforcement Police Department too. - [Peter] Oh, yep, yep. - You know? And I would encourage people to do that. I will tell you what, I've got over a hundred volunteers These are folks that are retired, that wanted something to do to give back to their communities. So, I have a number of volunteers that go through our that go out into this desert and do proactive patrols. They work with our They grab a patrol car and they go out and they It's all about being (gentle music) I'm gonna head East. - [Sheriff] Just so you - [Sheriff] Oh do you? Okay. Slow so far? (laughing) (soft music) - [Peter] So, here we go, double fence. - [Sheriff] Yep. See two lights up, right? - [Peter] Two lights, yeah. - [Sheriff] All rest of with the cameras because this Now you have this Highway 2 and this no gate. - [Peter] So how are they They can get over with a ladder. - [Peter] That takes a little time. Then they have to get that ladder over and then they have to... - [Sheriff] Well, really - [Peter] You shimmy down. - [Sheriff] Yeah. - [Peter] And then you have to get which would take time. Or, you can just go through that. - Which would allow Border Patrol - [Peter] Okay. (sheriff chuckles) - How much does that make sense? - [Peter] It's the smoothest - It's 'cause you're in a Raptor. My Search and Rescue 'cause regular four wheel You get beat up, 'cause As you'll see when I cut it gets a little rough. - [Peter] Oh yeah. (car tires gently screech) - [Sheriff] That was for you. This is a well known area where 'Cause you can cross right here. - [Peter] So, here we have And this is the border. When they get to the US side here, this is pretty tough going, huh? There's nothing over here. - It's two to three days from here to get to any And unfortunately this is where is because they've been it's only a little ways, you you don't have to have a And you're going through a bombing range. This is where the military There's a lot of unexploded ordinance and everything else that's out here. - So, the cartels have When they get the people, They've done their job, right? - [Sheriff] Yeah. - [Peter] They got their money. So, they don't care if - [Sheriff] No. It's a commodity. It's not a human life. - [Peter] So, you're saying- Those are people. - [Peter] Where? - [Peter] Oh geez. How are you guys doing? Came from India? Mumbai? Dehradun? - [Peter] Gujarati. - [Peter] Chicago. That's where you're going? Chicago? What'd you do in India? - [Peter] Congress party worker. Okay. You fly into Mexicali? - [Peter] No, fly. - [Sheriff] Were they on a bus? - [Peter] Were you on a bus? - [Sheriff] (to the radio) Yuma 1. With a group of nine from India. - [Speaker] Yeah, that's f***** weird. I wonder if there was a smuggler who was supposed to pick - [Sheriff] Might be. - [Speaker] That's kind of strange. I wonder if it's because But India is not a Title 42. - [Sheriff] No it's not, they're Title 8. So, I don't know why they Usually they're down by the river. - [Speaker] Maybe they - [Sheriff] Yeah. (Sheriff laughing) What's up brother? - [Speaker] How are you doing sir? - Good, you? - [Sheriff] Yeah, they were - [Sheriff] Oh, they have? - [Agent 2] How are you doing sir? - [Sheriff] Living the dream, right? - [Peter] How are you doing sir? - [Agent 2] Hey, how are you doing? - [Agent 2] Luis. - Usually they'll shoot like and then through 195 I'll try to have a.. - [Sheriff] Get another one across? - Yeah, get another one across. - So, it's all about tying up you guys. - Yes sir. - There you go. These folks we're sitting here constantly dialing 911 to get picked up. So, cartels exploiting by having them do that out here, to get their other product through back where we were before. - [Peter] What, people or drugs? - Both. And what better way to do 30 miles out in the middle of nowhere, where you know that public Human life is a priority. - [Peter] Night's coming, - Yeah. - So it's all part of the game. And I'm sure the cartel is 'cause the highway is right there. - I'll help you out. Look. Pull this one out, go like this, see? There you go. Pull the other one out. - [Peter] Why do they take the laces out? Just so they... - Well you can use them for... - [Peter] Whatever yeah. So, you gotta make sure they - [Peter] So they obviously have money. They had the money to fly from India. They're all wearing new clothes. They flew up, paid the cartels. - [Sheriff] Yeah. - [Peter] Have you seen many guys from India coming recently? - Oh, to be honest with I mean, to answer your question, yes, but they're all nationalities. - [Peter] But you can't really - No. - You can't talk to a PAO. - [Peter] Or the sheriff. - Yeah, the sheriff. - [Sheriff] So what you're No, you can still do your b-roll. - [Peter] Okay. what they're doing. So, that device that... device that he has, looks like a cell phone, is they're actually taking and that integrates all that into Border Patrol system. And they're also taking for that person's property. By the time they get to their info is already in And that's why I made a turned into TSA agents, because that's what happens at an airport, when you get on a plane, they take a picture of your passport, run it through the system, - Mission accomplished for them though, they're in now, they're gonna have an asylum hearing, whether it's right, or wrong - [Sheriff] Yeah. - If it's not a legitimate asylum, they're just gonna dodge it If it is, then they'll get - But you know, who this ain't fair too. Is the ones that are going and still waiting. This is not helping them at all. But yet they're going and they're just being - If you do it the right many years. But yet.. this is the only way to do it, - [Sheriff] Yeah. - And this is what's they'll have sort of a temporary status, until the asylum court hearing date, which is gonna be years out. - Right. - If it's not a legitimate over 70% aren't, then - Right. sort of in this in between status forever. Like actually an illegal status. - Yeah. - Now if their asylum claim it will go through the courts. They'll be processed and to a US citizen eventually. - Right. - So, that's how it works and that's - One out of 10. - [Peter] One out of 10, - Is roughly what the numbers were before. I would imagine when you've got last year that came across like this, it might be less than that. (chopper whirring) - [Peter] This makes sense now. they got through this little gap. - [Sheriff] Yeah. - [Peter] Because the fence - [Sheriff] You can dig under it. - [Peter] But it's even to get over it, right? - [Sheriff] Well, you don't - [Peter] Oh, you just dig right under. - [Sheriff] You can dig right under it. I'll show you a place where, when we get up here where underneath that. - [Peter] So if the fence was in that spot right there, there's no way they'd get through? - No, it'd still be - [Peter] 'Cause that's a family, like... It seemed like a... I mean who knows? - But if they were looking you're talking a minimum of two days. - [Peter] So, how many say, on this last 10 - Just those two. - [Peter] Just those two? - Yeah. See how they can just walk - [Peter] Okay, yeah, let's take a look. Just walk over here and you're good to go. - [Sheriff] Right. And you can tell it's being used. You can tell by the tracks - [Peter] Yeah, that's easy. The coyotes can literally and say walk over and call 911. - [Sheriff] Yeah. - [Peter] Easy. - [Sheriff] That's what - [Peter] That's why the and cleaner than mine. - [Sheriff] Yeah. - [Sheriff] I'm taking you and they're told to follow - [Peter] Oh, look at the fence - Yeah. Because we've experienced and their policies uptick through these desert areas. There's been a number of these stations that have been put up by Border Patrol. So, all you gotta do and rescue would come. - [Peter] One hour. - [Sheriff] Yeah. - [Peter] Because in the - It can get up to 115F, ambient air temperature, maybe 120F. But the ground temperature - So is the traffic relaxed a lot? The border, the crossing's it's more of a wintertime thing? - Not really. They just come across at night and then they hold up during the day. - [Peter] So right now, it's winter, they're going during the day? - During the day. And they'll still hold up in the washes and try to stay warm at night. This is the El Camino del Diablo. One of the passes where individuals will traverse across the border. - [Peter] So, the scouts live in Mexico and just come back and forth all the time? - No, they stay up in the mountain. - [Peter] For what weeks? - Oh yeah. And groups that come and whatever else they need. They find a location up in the mountains where they can monitor 'cause they carry radios with them. They carry solar panels with And that's how they get that gets through. So, they run a like a tally book. (gentle music) - All right guys, it's almost Unfortunately we didn't That was the goal, right? To show the hospital. - [Sheriff] It was, well, for you it was. - [Peter] Okay. - I mean, anybody can shoot a hospital. - [Peter] Okay, the story you had something to say. - Well, when you that a community has, part of that is the fact that Yuma County, 310,000 people came So, we have one hospital that It was a 23 million impact having to deal with illegal immigrants, that had to come into the for anything from that they had brought with them, that were never treated. Down to the fact that the neonatal ICU. The hospital had to cancel appointments, because they were the immigrant crisis and the hospital was not getting reimbursed at all, from the federal government. Now, you wonder why your is because the hospital with you as a consumer, to fill that gap. So, you're looking at tying up not only your law enforcement resources, because we're out here but you're tying up EMS You're tying up the that the local community because they're busy And with the federal government saying that it's their responsibility. Well, you know, put away your personal and political rhetoric and your innuendos. Get down to business, pay your bills. I'm average eating in housing illegals that and get reimbursed 5 cents on the dollar. - [Peter] Okay, so Yuma - Every citizen in Yuma Remember, every one of these and impacting our resources the interior of the United States. They're coming to your neighborhood, they're coming to your it is no longer a border crisis. It's a nation crisis. - [Peter] It's definitely a crisis. - [Sheriff] It is. - [Peter] That's the feel done here. - Pleasure. - That was awesome. I'm gonna finish this video - [Sheriff] Well, you have fun. (Sheriff laughing) - [Sheriff] Okay. - [Peter] There's a radio up here. - [Sheriff] A handheld radio? - [Peter] Handheld with an - [Sheriff] All right, hang on (chuckles). We have Buckeye cameras out here, so it might be a repeater for it. Yeah. - [Peter] That's one of your camera... - [Sheriff] Yeah, it's not a radio, - All right guys, wanna close That was an absolutely crazy experience today, and I can't even capture it in words, or through the camera. Obviously this is a super political topic. It has been forever. It's been used as leverage by each party. But no matter where you it is a humanitarian crisis. It is very serious. It is unsustainable. I can definitely say that. And even if, say you're the in the world, where there and everyone should be everywhere, you'd be horrified by the sex trafficking, by the powers of the cartel. It's absolutely dysfunctional So, today was just one peek in. I get it. There are many perspectives. There are hundreds of to really fully explain the situation, but today was a big eye-opener. I've done a few of these and the sheriff really they are dealing with, which is absolute insanity. All right guys, thanks for coming along on that journey, until the next one. (gentle music)
