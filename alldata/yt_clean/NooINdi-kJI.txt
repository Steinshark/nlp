- [Narrator] Every time a web of computers, is working to make you a better driver. - [Eli] That's a blind like, &quot;Hey, there's people to your left.&quot; - [Narrator] This web a system that lets your car think, and sometimes drive on its own. - It's truly like you're driving a supercomputer at all times. - [Narrator] But as the tech advances, there are questions about whether these automated backseat drivers are actually safe, especially as more cars hit the road without hands on the wheel. This is the Tech Behind Driver Assist. - So I'm not going to do anything, and then it should - [Narrator] If this car sees (brakes screeching) (car beeping) - [David] It's a pretty abrupt stop. - [Narrator] The Insurance says that, &quot;Technology like this, can reduce rear-end crashes by about 50%,&quot; and it's just one of a suite of features that make up Driver Assist. - The vehicle may to prevent a crash, or it may, you know, to get you back in your lane. And so anything that's is sort of a Driver Assist feature. - [Narrator] To get a closer look at the technology that the 'Journal&quot; visited the Toyota and Lexus - If I were to take out this entire dash, you would see hundreds if - [Narrator] These wires connect dozens, sometimes hundreds of - If we just had radar, but your foot was physically and it wasn't electronically controlled, we wouldn't be able to stop that as a car. So just by having one system alone without being able to it's really not, it's - [Narrator] Some like the temperature or the Others have complex from the core tech that An array of cameras and that allow it to see. The main camera is here. - It's gonna be a that's doing multiple fields of view. So it's gonna be scanning - [Narrator] Some cars also and under the mirrors. These cameras connect to chips that are trained to quickly cones, and cars. But many cars don't - Obviously, there are limitations, weather can cause problems, low light. - [Narrator] That's why many cars also have a variety of sensors. These sonar or ultrasonic send out sound or radio waves. - So as those bounce off, those return to them, and it's able to tell you - [Narrator] Then all of that data needs to be communicated back to the car. - [Eli] That radar sensor sends its signal through its wires, all the way up underneath it starts talking to its computers. So then from inside the it goes back out here, the request to slow down - [Narrator] So if you were using cruise control, for example. - It sees that we're kind The radar system knows that that is a very large and it is constantly calculating the distance between us and that. - [Narrator] But while all of that is watching what's happening there's tech watching the inside too. Most cars made in the last decade, use a sensor in the steering have their hands on it. - [Eli] But it knows that my hands here, if I just touch the sides of it, it understands that there's I have not steering it at all, but it's going to, once again, start to, see how it's pulling me back into my lane. There's no audible alert, and now it's saying, &quot;Hey, you're not touching So it says, &quot;Lane Departure Alert, - [Narrator] But many to incorporate this. - This is called our It's a couple of little laser arrays that are constantly looking for the attentiveness in my eyeballs. - [Narrator] These systems work together to make sure a driver has their attention on the road, if not... (car beeping) - [Eli] And it's letting me know, and then it's going to be - [Narrator] But this monitoring can be one of the hardest to get right. - Many of the vehicles will let you drive, you know, much longer than without knowing if the driver is engaged. - [Narrator] And one that as they move to the next step true hands-free driving. - [Driver Assist] - [Eli] I my hands kind on my knees. I have both my feet flat on the floor, and it's handling all - [Narrator] This is one of that does hands-free driving, a system the company calls Teammate. It only has a couple of additions, one being more computing power to process additional Another big difference is this, an additional sensor called LiDAR. - It's a, essentially a laser array, so it's kind of shooting out lasers. Having a laser array like a LIDAR sensor, being able to judge distance, will be exponentially faster than waiting for a radar - [Narrator] But LiDAR is expensive, and is usually only available But even though these systems they have a long way to go. The IIHS recently conducted its first test of partially automated systems, Teammate was the only that earned an Acceptable rating. None of them earned a Good. - Some of the manufacturers are not monitoring the driver well, there are a couple that you to go into a partial automation. And so depending on the manufacturer, there are pieces missing in order for them to get our Good rating. - [Narrator] While the with automated safety features, right now, the agency from automation focused on convenience, like hands-free driving. - We're concerned that drivers will become over-reliant on them. Even if a system works the driver may not be in an emergency situation. - [Narrator] Regulators have investigated hands-free systems from Tesla and while driverless in some cities, your car is probably still a long ways off from being able to - We're making lots of even the way different is very different. All of those have to go to figure out a self-driving car, and it's very challenging. (engine purring)
