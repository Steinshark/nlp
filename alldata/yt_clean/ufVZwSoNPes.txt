[BOTH] Welcome to Sad Boyz, a podcast - I'm Jarvis. And Eddy's here. - I didn't know if I should say my name. - I'm Eddy. - Hiiii! career, background, height, strength, - uh, UFC weight class. - [JORDAN] And vibes! Go ahead. - Um... 'cause I just know you know them. UFC weight class... - Uh... - Big and strong. - Just put &quot;big and strong&quot; for all of it. That's why you can't fight anyone, - 'cause you're above heavyweight. Jon Jones is shaking. There's some of that, usually-- but where you're a guest &quot;And go for it. What do you do?&quot; It's like, &quot;I don't know what to say &quot;He's a comedian, a podcaster, - It is shorthand for, &quot;I don't know you.&quot; &quot;I heard something about you. It's those moments where you know they're - it's like, &quot;I don't have anything.&quot; It's kind of a tell - Oh, yeah. to introduce yourself, - Right. &quot;Yeah, I'm an actor. Uh, make movies.&quot; - &quot;I broke my foot that time. Remember?&quot; &quot;And I don't have a personal life, &quot;And I'm not religious at all.&quot; - &quot;I won't sit down for the episode.&quot; - &quot;Aliens? What, like the movie?&quot; &quot;Oh, great, I'm a - Uh... - antennae are revealed. the thing that we do, where we... we have a guest on, so we don't have to - Yeah, I'm just here. He showed up to the wrong place at first, &quot;I don't know how to get home.&quot; It was Yeah. I usually--anytime, uh, an episode is happening here, I'm - Finally, they let me in. Yeah, I know. I make it really hard, other than my fist. I'll use, And they do not look good, Like a 14th-century cast-iron sword. The glass looks like when you have - and they scratched it all up. But in our defense, we're playing We've got the air conditioning on. We make sure you're not Yeah, we put up a sign that goes, - [JARVIS] &quot;Eddy's fine.&quot; Like, OK, maybe logistically the dog's not in literal danger. - But do you need to bring your dog? When you go to Kohl's, - like, in the car? If you're also walking the dog, maybe - do it and go home again? When I come back, he's panting like crazy! I'm teaching him to drive! The only, uh-- Yeah, the only times that's come up is when you have to stop for some reason, or like an emergency There's been very, very few times where I've needed to go do something. But it's usually on the way back where he's asleep. And I have the dog mode, where I can turn on the A/C, and so it shows what the to any curious onlookers. &quot;Anyone curious?&quot; Does it do that? Yeah, it says, you know... &quot;Hey, it's 65deg in here. - Address. - &quot;If lost...&quot; How's it going, Eddy? [JORDAN] Again, that's We don't keep up, or whatever. But like... - What have I been up to? - a video on YouTube. The world will never be the same. - You took down Apple. - W-w-w-wake up, babe! - Steve Jobs died again after my video. - Oh, shit. Wait, real quick, did you see that that happened - [EDDY] That what happened? - No! Three times deep now. - So there's this company called Fisker, - and they make, like-- - Yeah! but he gave a--he said the car was shit. Basically, he was like, &quot;This car - Mm. They hit him up, like, &quot;We have an Can you please hold off and he's like, &quot;It's not my policy to wait for you to be in your - That's not how a review works. Someone can buy it. &quot;We just watched the review. - And then their stock tanked like 40%. It was like a--and then they had to talk about his YouTube video. It was crazy. They have to talk about Marques - [EDDY] Yeah. I don't have Marques's impact, not only-- I mean, I don't think he could Also, people, I had somebody, uh... The comments and everything have After something goes out, it's like If people like it, I'll be like, But I did see one comment like, &quot;This is the least informative It's like, it's 'cause I'm not a reviewer! That's the, um... That's the guy who used to comment on my old YouTube videos, uh, &quot;I like the tech information. Like, that was a real person who was like, &quot;I just don't like the comedy. - the information better?&quot; and sees a video on Reddit, they're like, &quot;This video - There should be no entertainment value. It should basically be like and then print the &quot;I need it to go into my brain so - [EDDY] Mmhmm. &quot;I need my hair to be blown back.&quot; Um... Now, Eddy, uh... do what you do Do the little... I was trying to do the &quot;Describe whatever No, dude. A local news story that's come back to his hometown. &quot;Oh, yeah, you do stand-up!&quot; So, you paid $3,500 for the Vision Pro. Yeah. And, by the way, I didn't get to return it. The video took me over a month, One of the things is somebody was like, I did... not. (all laughing) - But yeah, sorry. You were saying? I just wanted to say It's a good, like... You talk about your experience in it. You talk about our place in society with technology and what Also, we were talking about it and you worked really hard, So if anybody wants to go over to Eddy's channel and watch the video, um-- Wait 'til this episode's done. - Wait, no, don't go! No, please! Stop! Don't expect a tech review. It's, uh, called but it's not, like, really a takedown of the product. - But, uh... for, like, a regular review. - It doesn't read like that. just because the product's bad. - It's like the dystopian outlook. When I was talking about it with Jarvis, 'cause I think we went out, like, um... Uh, that was also the day that - Maybe a week before I put the video up? And it was, uh... Something that specifically the, um-- Again, it's not exactly about the product, but it's about the idea of [JARVIS] Yeah. Basically, the relationship of humans with reality, basically, and the fact that physically into somebody's vision, it will change the way your brain works. So it's like, yeah, like... I saw the product and I was like, because it might be kinda cool,&quot; which every bit of technology-- Anything that fucks us over, - So people are like, &quot;Oh, it's fine.&quot; It is fun to see a piece of the general consensus when, really, there's any kind of... I hate the term, but in a particular technology, it's always interesting &quot;Oh, ChatGPT is the And I always feel like a lot of us have to be skeptical about &quot;AI has been a part - You just didn't know.&quot; Also, my question is... The problems that That doesn't fix any of them. And so I'm like, the aspects - I already like those aspects of my life. Like, I don't need... I can pull up a recipe just fine. I don't need it floating next to the pan. Yeah, exactly right. That is the thesis, kind of-- is that it is... You know, some of those theories This is a weird embellishment - Like, it's not enhanced. So, the last thing just 'cause I wanna I don't wanna talk about my shit too much. We made you, so... - But, uh... You're like, &quot;Oh, - Do a couple little jokes, pal. I think, you know, a little bit more vulnerable I am trying to... not just... I guess really express things which I will always do, but like all of the time And with this one, it's weird, because the intention... It's not, I guess, a spoiler. End of the video, But it's weird to have I think the only thing that I wanted I wanted people to leave that making it and the - [JARVIS] Right. 'cause I had to put it up on a Friday And it's very weird to be like, This tortured me for months. This was I'm gonna go grab a drink,&quot; and all the comments are like, &quot;Hey, I'm high and it's a Friday night, Other than the panic attack ones, &quot;Wow, this made me feel awful,&quot; - I'm like, &quot;YES!&quot; - &quot;You're welcome!&quot; No, I was just gonna say, for like... Obviously, a $3,500 piece of technology is not meant for the everyman - at this current stage. I think it's important to have critiques at this-- 'Cause no one's ever gonna from doing whatever, you know, they want to do. And so I think that this is a great time to kind of put the idea so that we can be more... We can have the tools. It's like, I worked so I'm already tech-cynical. - [EDDY] Right. To the average consumer, it's very or what the goals of companies are It's OK to have a, uh-- I think a lot of people because they maybe don't or imbue that instinct with which personally I'm fine doing that, but some people don't 'cause it scares them, and they don't wanna feel bad about But... You know, it's OK that AND this technology because it's a little eerie. It has weird implications. It's like, &quot;Well, reality is in 1080p. - Don't you wanna be 1440?&quot; I'm like, &quot;My reality's in 1080p?&quot; And, like, the one case with that that I wanted to put out I feel like it's really easy to look back and assume rather than it being Like cars in America, possibly, the fact that we don't have and LA specifically, where, you know, was invested into by car companies and then destroyed in Los Angeles. Maybe the Revolutionary War kinda fucked you guys over, huh? Ever been to London, pal? - Yeah, we don't have the Tube. I guess the last-last thing I was getting really worried Um, already, there's people-- We grew up where there was a time where social media, we watched it happen. But if you're just a few years after us, - these are regular pillars of your life. Like, even the fact-- I'm working on a video with how some Hollywood stuff Even the concept of and then not accessing and having to wait for it to it doesn't feel real to me. Yeah, the value - &quot;don't miss this.&quot; And so, like, if you are it's like part of the video I want those people to know it's not fair that you into a public product for people at the age of nine when - Yeah. And the reason for it is literally just because Mark Zuckerberg is like, We have a stock price. - We need to keep going.&quot; - Yes. And because of-- And everyone wants to make Right. And because of those pressures you, especially young girls are now looking at their body but never have to this heightened detail. And then they have to present it to the world, as children. You have to verify the insecurities - everyone has naturally, and then kind of entertain them Right. And obviously, other things I'm not saying But that aspect of is a recent creation that wasn't But it's good that you should know that it's just so another rich person can look at their portfolio and be like, - Yeah, it's the profit motive. And that has side effects. You don't just keep getting to-- Like, in order to make that money, you have to squeeze - squeeze the attention out of people. I mean, yeah. I remember having to--I was actively pushing my friends to get Facebook, because they were still using I'm like, &quot;Get with the times. - I wanna Poke you, dude.&quot; And that push... In retrospect, what was my motivation? It was the sensation that I was... - ahead. I was winning the curve. And I feel like ever since then, reverse propaganda, almost, to say, &quot;Hey, old man, When you criticize the fact that everybody's just thinking (scoffs) OK, dude. - But it is weird. It is a little bit peculiar that-- Even myself, I'm trying to present myself as, &quot;What do I care? - I care. I'm into it. I remember what somewhat invested in - even if I'm not posting. If you grew up with that you don't have any cynicism about it, and you have a friend with and you have... I don't know. You have 200 followers; your friend How could you not metabolize [EDDY] Exactly. video stuff now, I was like... We have all reached at least to a level-- By the way, when YouTubers or anyone on the internet, with a lot of followers online right now. - It's like, &quot;You are not special.&quot; - Yeah. It's like, truly, nothing changes. And, in fact, when say you have a million after your name, you're like, &quot;Oh, it's actually really And I don't blame them It's something that, yeah, I'm sure you've definitely talked but you wanna put out there &quot;If you're young, But I promise you Like, none of that will. - And-- of it being a group - maybe, implicitly. Going for a walk is gonna do Going for a walk and sniffing a flower is truly the time-tested way It's the way to do it. I don't know. I've got - and it does amazing things for me. We're actually doing--ah, war. - (laughing) Aw, fuck. is I saw somebody was like, &quot;Hey, I loved your video about the Vision Pro. I do think there are some positives. Like, for example, this meditation app And it's like, &quot;May I suggest Like, you don't need this! I don't wanna gatekeep stuff. That feels-- I mean, I don't even meditate, - Not meditating? I'm sure that you can do meditation and you don't have to it's... stimulation, right? But anyway, there's It's just, uh... I think you don't wanna just look at any of the positives as a panacea It's not invalid to criticize something So, that's why it's like, I don't wanna be but occasionally you can make about things you dislike. And I like the imagination bingeing my videos for the first time, So it's like, fuckin', and then it gets dark, by their laptop light - &quot;What the fuck?&quot; &quot;I was here to see you go to &quot;Dude, I thought you just were gonna - &quot;What happened to the 'knees' thing?&quot; - They started really early. - &quot;Why's this guy got a mustache?&quot; I gotta reverse it by doing called &quot;Desperate YouTuber Yeah. That's you--it's, uh-- The thumbnail is all of the comments - saying to do another road trip video, and then you weeping and saying OK. - &quot;I'm sorry, everyone.&quot; It's a screenshot of your Um, OK, so I know the perfect thing - to move us onto the next topic. And it's, uh-- (laughing) to watch this video called &quot;Jarvis Johnson Biography, Engneer, Height, Weight, Hobbies, Facts, Net Worth.&quot; - Uh... - Wait, oh, it's a video?! - Uh... Let me see that thumbo? Wait. The thumbo is like... - Is that the merch? - Are you calling thumbnails &quot;thumbos&quot;? - Sometimes. - But I've never heard it. If you use it, you have to to make sure that it's fair use. Do you remember--I'm sure There was a YouTube channel. that I found during the summer when just would make these fake, just like a bunch of videos I think it happened to - &quot;This person versus this person.&quot; &quot;YouTuber Eddy Burback I'd be like, Back in my day, someone would animate a and make it sound like Whoa, come on now. - &quot;Fancy TV.&quot; That's gotta feel good. - Ayy, let's go. That's not--oh, that [JACOB] You had - WAY more than Bryce Hall! maybe the views come - featured in the corner of that image. Jacob, can we humble him? - Can you click on &quot;popular&quot;? - Oh, Brent Rivera! - And Lexi Rivera. That's the thing. We could criticize Brent Rivera, And you know how he even got Is if you go back to the thumbnail is of me with, uh, - Brent Rivera's ex. - Ohhh. Can I make a tiny detour really quick, something hilarious that happened? I'll only talk about it on here. It was months ago. It was hilarious. Um, fucking Brent did a &quot;going to every Gordon - [JARVIS] Whooooa. - Officially sponsored. I'm not encouraging you I didn't like it. But, uh, he did that, and he copied-- originally copied my thumbnail exactly. - It's a Brent Rivera special. for the idea to me, even though technically it was Ted's idea, and then we both did it, but then the changed the thumbnail and removed me from the description. - [JORDAN] Oh, hell yeah. an editor that did it, - &quot;Don't fucking...&quot; - Yeah. - of just ripping thumbnails. Didn't Danny make a whole video - Probably. I censored myself and said Hey, we appreciate it. - What the fuck happened? - Sorry. but I am gonna assume - We can't watch a little bit? - I wanna watch a little bit. - Ooh, cool. It's called Fancy TV? &quot;THIS VIDEO IS MADE FOR ENTERTAIN--&quot; That looks stolen--whoooa, - Whoooa! Whoa! - <i>Jarvis Allen Johnson.</i> <i>Also known as Jarvis Johnson.</i> - He just took out the middle name? - &quot;AKA.&quot; - OK. - to hack your account. - <i>as of 2024.</i> I don't know how he did that. <i>Birthplace: Gainesville,</i> - <i>Florida, United States.</i> - &quot;Mother's maiden name.&quot; Oh, that's a nice picture. - Cassius took that. - What? <i>Zodiac sign: Taurus.</i> - Respect.

But they put that in your life story, that Cody Ko gave you an Is there a chance this is from, like, an interview or something? - 'Cause it's very... about 5-Minute Crafts like and so I changed the title of mine. But the only thing - Cody's video is called &quot;5 Min Crafts.&quot; My video was called And then I changed my title to &quot;5-Minute OK, yeah. And did it change The video got like--it had 15,000 - Oh, OK, so that does matter. because it was like But it's still unclear to me - related to Cody Ko or not. But my whole thought process was like, it was... I was at the wedding and I saw Cody Ko posted that video. &quot;I didn't think of using Now that a big YouTuber's talked about it, people probably know the name of 'Cause I was already experimenting It is extremely funny to show a photo of - That is funny. They're calling me out. - &quot;Marital status: not her.&quot; Also, uh, this frame looks like it's from a true crime I die, yeah. That's a They're like, &quot;He was Yeah, &quot;65 kilograms. 6'.&quot; &quot;Always laughing. Unmarried.&quot; (all laughing) The Unmarried Killer.

Oh, it also hashtags Oh, hell yeah. - Do you think he meant to talk about him? &quot;It's 3:00 a.m. and the - OK. The list of things? (laughs) Someone watched that high. It's just the script of the video. Wait, &quot;YouTube star Kurtis Conner on his Twitter account - in January 2021.&quot; - [JARVIS] Aw! That is funny, because I texted Because we did, uh, Kurtis's podcast-- - We were ranking how hot Pokemon were. And it came up in a different conversation 'cause I sent the screencap 'cause it was a joke related to something. And then I realized it had been and I texted Kurtis, like, - three years since we did this?&quot; - Didn't mention the breast milk thing. Didn't mention Thank you. Barely mentioned you. - Yeah. Didn't mention Sad Boyz a lick. I think it is healthy... - not to mention us as a duo too much. 'Cause I would rather - Oh. Interesting. - You know what I mean? Danny and Drew did the they shot themselves in the foot, one, was funny when they made it initially, and then has never been funny since, - because people got weird with it. and then they did the thing we acknowledge the joke. &quot;And then... and then we leave it there.&quot; And it was. It was funny. But then people aren't funny. - Yeah. Like... - And that's OK. If you still do that, like you mean well, you're just trying to be in with them. You like their stuff. - Maybe just, uh... - Maybe just treat them as individuals. And that's coming from me. Yeah, not them. This is not behind the scenes. It's just like, you know-- Also, I mean, to be honest, I'll get personally annoyed, one of them, I'll watch like and the top comment And it's just like... Not the top comment, Maybe we should do that, like... - with you two guys. the first thing I thought of was, like, &quot;Oh, that was a bit because people 'cause we worked together. And it didn't make sense that - Also, we have the same birthday. - [JARVIS] Yeah, well. in text, because of the J names, possibly? It would be like, people would be like, &quot;Hey, Jarvis, can you And these are, you know, people that work with us, and very often not - a lot of team crossover. - Like... - he worked in partnerships. It was insane. It was insane. - Um... - I didn't work there. - I'm thinking of stuff you said off-mic. - Noooo! Dude, I'm so sorry, Justin Trudeau. Eddy. Shit. - My B. - Jordan? You tried Prime for the first time. - Yes! Oh, yeah. Um, I was grabbing a Prime for a friend of mine. They're a fan. - [EDDY] Of Prime, or you? - They don't like my shit. - kinda goes, dude. That's kind of a bar.- - Ooh. Without exaggeration, you know, - I was skeptical. Maybe not the drink for me. I always Which one did you get? Because there's two Primes, - I never buy it, really, so... Wait, don't they have-- oh, Yeah, there's an energy drink, Sports drink and energy drink. Same company. Same logo. The real only way - And one is in a bottle. It felt really good, where I would buy a Gatorade, - But instead I got the Ice Pop flavor. - The red, white, and blue? And I'm sure that this is, I hope, in that I said it's or anything I've ever had I... - One and a half sips. Appallingly bad--&quot;a-Paul&quot;? Come on. - A-Paul-ing. - Greg-Paul-ingly bad. It is that level, yeah. Im-Paul-sively bad. (sarcastic laughter) My drink kept kissing me. I... I-- (sighs) It was very frustrating, OK, well, I'm going to mention it, but it's just gonna sound like I'm being - an anti-Paul cynic or something. I need people to understand... I'm not a big soda drinker, really. Usually sugar-free, 'cause I'm... - I'm the sugar-free bastard. It's weird what they do. But it is, like... Even for kids, I am amazed that they like it. - It's hyper-sweet. But it's not sugar-sweet, because it's using some sugar substitute. And it also has, like, you know... a, by all accounts, not very, uh, rehydrating set of salts. It doesn't have a rehydrating But it does have the salty aftertaste. - It's mainly potassium? And, uh, and not sodium, which is what you would want The idea of finishing a workout It tastes like drinking concentrate So, I would say that their big thing as much of a salty aftertaste but the reason that your average is because sodium is the most, like, - electrolyte-rehydrating thing. Well, that's even-- 'Cause I was, you know, I'm not anymore, but at the end of last year and the day before there was a lightning So I did train further but I only ran Was that a relief? That would be a relief for me. So, I was really conflicted in my head. I think there are somebody who's relieved &quot;Oh my God, I trained And I think I'm both people, It was the night before when it got... when it got, uh, not canceled, And it was like, &quot;Oh, that's a bummer, but now I don't have to do Um, and yeah, what I was once I was doing that, it was like, to get my electrolytes back. or have an electrolyte It's just like, Prime or even Gatorade, I'm like, there's - I like a Gatorade Zero. - Lime and cucumber, or whatever? Or the, um, Pedialyte, it's like Gatorade-lyte or whatever, where its main goal is the hydrating. 'Cause when I was a kid, and then I found out it has - [EDDY] Yeah. maybe that's not what more niche products are still fine, - or I'll just do Liquid IV now. I do have this weird part with almost anything now, I have to just--anything I have to justify it as even 1% productive. - Mmhmm. non-water drink, I have to think, like, &quot;Well, cranberry juice That's pretty reasonable.&quot; Pepsi, you know? I have to have a-- &quot;Diet Pepsi, there's no sugar, but Yeah, no, I feel that. Jarvis and I this last week - eating stuff with that mentality. But that's a whole different But yeah, similar in my brain of having to &quot;earn&quot;-- It's not great. - But that's a private conversation. And the Jordan review, Yeah. I don't-- - It would be not having any, would be it. Yeah. I suppose if the-- I would say it wouldn't be having - What about 100 stars? - it's not--there aren't any in it. Like electrolytes, No, I genuinely--I almost wanna encourage-- I don't wanna encourage that I don't actually like, but goddamn, dude. Again, it's frustrating, 'cause &quot;Hey, this movie? Zero out of ten. Trash.&quot; Just so bad. So confusingly bad. - Yeah. and making colorful bottles It makes sense why it's popular with kids, 'cause it's over-sweet. It's like they're doing they're trying--it tastes like... a lollipop that's been melted, where, when you drink... Excuse me. When you lick an ice cream cone or eat ice cream or a lollipop... when something is cold, - we taste the sweetness less, and so for anyone who's and then suddenly it feels much sweeter, - Yeah. - Prime tastes like it's melted ice pop. - And so it's hyper-sweet. being ice pop-flavored. Dub. Crushed it, I guess. - But I-- - Yeah. Haven't been watching for very long, - but I assume all his content-- Kind of, yeah, no misses, that guy. He convinced me to buy a &quot;Cum Coin,&quot; Logan is fascinating to me. He rides these waves-- He's obviously just and rides the waves of, like... getting... really dumb people to like him, and then them turning on him for even a dumb reason but it's like, You're like, He doesn't... yeah, it's weird. He does not, like, That's one weird thing is that people turn quick. Yeah. Well, they're like, uh... They're like cockroaches. Right. They would survive Yes. If a nuclear apocalypse happened... and then it was like, say, Mad Max, when you got to the Thunderdome, - Logan Paul would be in that ring. - He would work his way, no matter what. I wouldn't doubt him It is very frustrating. especially like professional athletes, but if somebody shows athletic prowess, you get like 10% back from me. It's annoying that he's That's the thing. The WWE thing is-- I'm not even, like, into WWE. And I hate when people are like, Just... it's a thing that people like. - Um, but-- - but it seems like a good time. and he plays a good heel, so it's like... He knows when to do something to where people that &quot;Gotta give him a little credit for that.&quot; - to make a lot of money. If Taylor Swift came out everyone would turn around. - Hey, thumbs up.&quot; Have you seen the meme - eating the popcorn and smiling? So, uh, uh... Let me pull up her name, because, um... She's... it's escaping me. While you're looking it up, - It's something that made me... It made me cringe a little, and then when you see the let's go easy, everybody. Let's privately maybe go, So, that's Kelsey Plum. - She is an incredibly talented athlete. And the last time she went viral, it was of her throwing a T-shirt... uh, that was packed up into the crowd, and threw like a tight spiral T-shirt into the back of the stands. And that went viral 'cause everybody - &quot;Kelsey Plum just launched it.&quot; I think if these things then everyone would've just forgotten. Oh, yeah, I think this is it. Do they follow it? - That's actually insane. - Holy shit! - Is it gonna go through the wall?! Did somebody catch it? - Yoooo! - That was awesome. She can be a little cringey if you can throw Shoutout, Kelsey Plum. Shoutout, WNBA. Shoutout, women's college basketball. Uh, incredible, incredible final. I watched a lot of the tournament. Um, shoutout, Dawn Staley. Shoutout, uh, Shoutout, Iowa. - Shoutout... every shoutout. Uh, Caitlin Clark, uh, Hannah Stuelke, um-- You're crushing the Um, um... fuck! Uh, God. I wouldn't crush the I would listen to it. - [JORDAN] Wow. - 'Cause you can't think of any? That's ripped straight from a I, uh... The... Yeah, the whole storylines with, uh, like the women's, um, I also watched--I also watched the men's. - OK? So, equal opportunity here. - Eddy's leaving. Shoutout, UConn on the back-to-back. Uh, first back-to-back since, uh, my Florida Gators did it in '06/'07, so... - Pretty huge. Huh? I think so, yeah. Um... Eat shit, pal. - That's OK. - Yeah, J for Jarvis. - Unmarried, by the way. Um... Unmoored, untrapped. - But, uh... - Yeah. - It's a hobby. Yeah, I loved it. - Going to the Clippers/Suns game tonight. Pretty stoked about that. - You on the bench, or...? - Yeah. I was late to messaging you, so... One of my friends just and has a new roommate, and that and so they got tickets And I was like, &quot;I wanna go.&quot; 'Cause in... this week? Or next week. Anyway, it's about to be playoff time. - Woo! Oh, I gotta play tonight. I completely forgot that was happening. - Oh, yeah, you gotta play. Oh, you gotta play. OK. I'll be honest; I was actually gonna wait 'til after the podcast to ask what you're doing tonight. - I was like, &quot;Damn, don't ask.&quot; - The opera is tonight! - What were you gonna say, Jarvis? a little, tiny little politics moment. The, uh, before the the coach of South Carolina, who's a extremely decorated, um... player in her own right and now coaching, In like 16 years, uh, turned her school into a dynasty. But anyway, Dawn Staley, she gets asked... I'm still learning. I'm still, you know, if I'm new at NBA, at WNBA and at women's college ball, - I'm just slurping up all the content. - I'm in the-- - You can enjoy it from afar. - that is not OK. - Bring out the lobster! - Lobster! So... but-- OK, so at a... um, post-game interview, like after they, uh... they win their Final Four matchup a, uh, &quot;journalist&quot; from one of those, like, - alt-right-adjacent things-- OutKick, I think it's called? - OutKick? he asked her about transgender athletes. And then it's like-- transgender athletes in, uh, basketball, and there's like, of the... NCAA entirety, there's like a handful. And so it's like a .0006% representation, and not even in the sport - So it's completely irrelevant. Yeah, exactly. And of course, they make it seem and they're like, &quot;Do you think And then she, like... takes a sip of water... calmly responds, and is like, &quot;I know what you're trying to do. - This is gonna flood my timeline.&quot; &quot;You know, whatever. &quot;Yes, if you consider yourself a women, And then, uh... And she's like, &quot;I know I'm gonna get some flack for this. But she was just and then they fucking won - It was such a fucking mic drop moment. 'Cause, you know, asking that before, - she was like, &quot;This is a distraction.&quot; You know, 'cause... &quot;This is not a real issue, and I'm trying to keep everybody focused. It's the foundation - &quot;What if there was a dragon?&quot; &quot;Imagine something I think his other question was about - Like, what are you doing? like, OK, well, have trans people - or sport in America? - 'cause you keep saying. &quot;No, but what if it did, though?&quot; &quot;But what if it did?!&quot; - Oh my God. And then, uh, uh... What's his fucking name? He used to play for University of Florida, Um... Chandler Parsons. Chandler Parsons, who he's like a talking head now. He was like, &quot;So, if Zach Edey,&quot; who's like a 7'4&quot; player from Purdue, &quot;uh, wanted to be a woman, All of the hypotheticals are always, &quot;So, if somebody who is not trans... decided,&quot; like...? Yeah, but then also, there's like-- There's-- (laughs) There's all these rules have to jump through to compete be on certain, um, medications and stuff and certain hormones for like a year, Basically, no one is doing that because it's... (laughs) - It is not fun. Like, the exceptional and emotional distress in these cases, they're always saying... I guess they're saying that - or they're lying for this benefit. As opposed to... just, I guess, investing in in the sport that they're in! - It reminds me of that swimmer... that trans swimmer who competed, and didn't perform that well. But then there was another woman who complained about the trans woman, uh, competing, and then they looked at the standings and the girl complaining also lost - Ohhh, I remember her. - why don't you focus on your actual... - It's, like, not affecting you. It's, like, SO not affecting you. It is, I mean... (laughs) It's a tricky... uh, issue when the thing that is so simple. It's so simple, but because they're so distressed by it, you have to entertain it. It's like a kid that trips In that case, you're a little bit more - to an adult that did the same. But you still can't really validate it. It's impossible to have any type of-- If they wanna have whatever a because they're starting from a - that there's no... back-and-forth that you could even say. You ever talked to &quot;Oh, we're on like a different planet Like, I actually The one thing I normally like if it was somebody from my And this is not my own thing. But I say, &quot;Just give me one trait that doesn't have to do with, like, human anatomy,&quot; 'cause - &quot;Give me one trait that every man has.&quot; It's like, you can't say &quot;football.&quot; Not everybody likes football. - &quot;Whiskey.&quot; Like, tell me something. (laughing) Yeah! But then those freaks - transvestigate every person. I mean, we're not No, no. But it came up because... uh, I think Dawn Staley's cool. Uh, and I think - and I'm excited to watch more of it. Like, people actually It's just extremely unfunny &quot;It's so boring. Haven't seen it, though.&quot; Oh, yeah. Oh, I guess is the women's NCAA championship game, basketball game, uh, had like... 19 million people watch it, and it was like the most viewed of any league in the past five years, And then it also beat out - That's so... - But it's so boring. a huge moment right now, and I'm excited to, like, A lot of the players who are, uh... big stars in college are going to the WNBA this year, and so... There was a story about how Caitlin Clark, and I tried to downplay 'cause the media has But she's incredible. And she's like the Steph Curry of, uh... She just shoots the ball from half-court and it just goes in every time. That is--I would do that. If I could get any skill to do basketball, it would be throwing it I thought you were doing a, [JORDAN] I was--ohhhh, - I forgot to do it! But Caitlin Clark, the team She's gonna get the one of the best college players and some are saying of all time. I don't know the game enough to say that. But, uh... But they're having to - for their inaugural game with her. - It's too easy. &quot;We're adding in another 8,000 seats, - Like, that's sick! - Yeah. I mean, there was another thing-- God, I'm so sorry I'm doing this, but... There was a, um... Sabrina Io-nos-cu. Uh, Ionescu. Uh, let me double-check. - Is it cool if I pee really quickly? Oh, dude, I will do the same. - That's crazy. Let's do it together. Same time. OK, so while they're gone, Uh, I just thought-- Hey, guys. Um... - (distantly) Oh, he shut the door. during NBA All-Star weekend where Steph Curry and face-off of three-point contest. It was super awesome. Um, and Sabrina is an incredible shooter, and she scored better than all of the men who were competing Steph did edge it out, but... Um, I thought that was super rad. Um, and so I'm excited I've just gotten into men's ball so I'm stoked. I think I'm gonna go to [JACOB] Hell yeah. - [JACOB] Intermission. Now it's just me. (gentle jazzy tunes) OK, we're back from our, uh, simultaneous bathroom break. - We all went to go pee together. We didn't cross the streams. Can I say how nice it was for somebody else to prompt - I'm the pee bastard. Yeah, with the little cherubs or whatever. (laughing) I mean-- Like, is that what that it is? - They're pissing? - Yeah! It's like World of Color. We lit it up. [JARVIS] We lit that thing up. - With LEDs. Yeah, we projected part of Dumbo on you. (Eddy &amp; Jarvis laughing) - I was so hydrated it was blue. I'm concerned that yours was red. - That does have me a little worried. - [JARVIS] Yeah, that was-- - (all laughing) - [JARVIS] Uh, yeah. I go to the doctor to just tell them &quot;Dude, my friend pissed Dumbo.&quot; So the doctor's like, &quot;Oh my God.&quot; &quot;This elephant has huge ears.&quot; - [JORDAN] &quot;Is that a bad sign?&quot; &quot;Yeah, he can fly and stuff. &quot;Who are these crows?&quot; - &quot;Oh, no, no, no!&quot; [JORDAN] &quot;Well, it's pretty funny.&quot; - &quot;This is like Eddy's video!&quot; So, Jacob prepared something today. Actually, we were having and Jacob said, &quot;Have you guys heard of,&quot; and then what it was. And we didn't know what he was saying. How is it-- - Do we know how it's pronounced? [JACOB] Yeah, so I'm hoping here with me that know [JACOB] It's Donghua - Right. that uses all the - &quot;The quick brown fox&quot;? - I think I actually do know this. Is this--wait, I don't wanna spoil it. - But... No, but I don't--OK. I don't wanna say it ahead of time Maybe write it down in your Notes app. - I'll just say what I thought it was, - and I won't lie. - [JACOB] Yeah. - No, I won't lie. - say that quite a bit, actually. were exactly what they were this week.&quot; - Oh my God, wait. Did that say-- - Oh, man. We'll look at that at Nightz. not the sources or the main ones of these. I saw this with, like-- jokes of this with I think two or &quot;What the fuck is this trend?&quot; Isn't that funny, when you find but you didn't find the main thing, - so you're like, &quot;What's going on?&quot; What are you talking about?&quot; - like, important that happened, and it's just like, latest news in this major event?&quot; And people are like, And it's just them... I don't know, like a spoof about the Sims, but it's taking place in that. I'm like, [JACOB] This company is a glycine manufacturer that - ended up doing some promo on TikTok. [JACOB] And, because it's TikTok, their videos went viral, and people just think it's hilarious. That must be so confusing for companies. [JACOB] Here's one of that did super well, for whatever reason. Did this guy also make (Jordan wheezing) It's like going to a brewery You're like, &quot;Follow for more!&quot; So, I was getting... barely any likes, AI, like, versions of celebrities advertising this. - Ohhh. Joe Biden doing the script for this. (all laughing) [JACOB] Yeah, and so... yeah, it's... - a fairly normal video at its core. [JACOB] It is a company that that they are a manufacturer of glycine, and so if you need glycine... - They got it. - [JACOB] Um, TikTok-- of, uh, factory-farmed foods. Yeah, I'm like, &quot;Who...?&quot; 'Cause the average TikTok audience Right. I feel like every company now We gotta have some--&quot; [JACOB] I was just gonna say TikTok - Yeah. - Yeah. - [JACOB] Um, which is why it's funny. It's like, &quot;Dad, you work in food, right? Maybe you can buy &quot;This pickle tastes like shit. &quot;I've been trying to make some [JACOB] TikTok is a very... random--you don't choose, - Right. and it's funny, because this is obviously not somebody who would be [JACOB] And so people and so now there's this woman, um, where it's <i>OK, glycine girlies.</i> - <i>We just got a big update.</i> - I wanna be a glycine girlie. We don't have a group name - That could be it. <i>to their stories last night. <i>but we got an exclusive look <i>for the industrial-grade glycine.</i> - <i>Stop. See that?</i> - <i>They're using the GEK260W/S--</i> I couldn't even pretend to know - I don't know what it does. - That's the glycine circle! Can I--OK. I could be wrong. but the state of the internet. If we--she explains what this machine does and then we Google this machine I wanna check to see if this is-- - It's tongue-in-cheek, right? This is like when, um... This is like when everybody works together - to create a lore, - and I love that. - This is AO3 fanfic. Wait, let's.. <i>...made by the Zhejiang Golden Eagle - Yeah, of course. I take it back. She's being funny. <i>...use the popular Haida 330T.</i> <i>But this is what really sets them apart.</i> <i>So, we've all seen Daisy (all laughing) - This is a great video. &quot;We've all seen Daisy.&quot; <i>...and we all know that it's quality.</i> <i>So Donghua Jinlong choosing <i>for their injection molding machines <i>but I think in the long run</i> <i>it's probably why they're the best. <i>- We'll let them walk around.</i> - high-level satire. I love it. - Yeah. I feel bad that, even for I thought this was a serious video. - That's incredible satire. I love it. this kind of discourse is, because it is the exact kind of topic Right before I came here, have conspiracies about the eclipse, so my brain was thinking about... - Uh, did we...? - We talked about it last week. - that it was gonna, like... And CERN is involved, - Yeah. the Large Hadron Collider's Or the fact that and eclipses happen very frequently, - Yes. is I thought this was but this is just feigning genuine interest on this manufacturing process. And what sets them apart from It's so funny. &quot;We all know Heidi.&quot; - Um... Also, just going to, Wait, I wanna keep watching. Then I wanna look at the comments. - I feel like they're gonna be funny. [JACOB] Yeah. <i>...probably why they're the best. <i>We'll let them walk around. <i>a nice, calming green color.</i> <i>And the cameraperson <i>a hallway above <i>So the fact that they posted this to <i>and then they made the conscious <i>and not a regular video,</i> <i>it tells us that they really wanted</i> <i>only the real fans to see this.</i> Like... like the three people right here, - the glycine girlies. I love the &quot;MASSIVE - Wait, let's look at the comments. &quot;They're not afraid to innovate. (Eddy &amp; Jarvis laughing) &quot;This is a total game changer. [JACOB] Yeah, and then - &quot;Glycine girlies.&quot; - (Jarvis laughing) This is perfect. Is she on a train? <i>but they do monkfruit sweeteners.</i> True. That's--that's rude. Yeah. Call them out. - I don't like this. This is mean. This is me in high school This is so perfect, because both the people are doing such a great parody of internet discourse and playing it so straight. - Yeah, exactly. becoming more and more elaborate, as opposed to just going farce-mode. Yeah, like if you exchange Like, this discourse has happened somebody making a claim just like that This is great. She's really funny. &quot;Let's clear up some MYTHS and their 'competitors.'&quot; Um... &quot;Real ones know it's - &quot;Senator, I'm Singaporean.&quot; what the Donghua Jinlong - Also, can we-- &quot;Somewhere, there's an incredibly niche <i>I know the cost of (all laughing) Wait, this is so--such a good deepfake. <i>...annual glycine credit <i>$400 a month for the next two years</i> <i>as glycine rates come down.</i> - Glycine credit to every American. why his AI productions One is obviously there's - but also he's such a static speaker. Often, you can tell it's AI - doesn't align with the head movements. &quot;Well, that's what's going on, you know?&quot; The AI stuff does him favors, 'cause it sounds more - [JARVIS] Honestly. from like two months ago, right? - [JACOB] Oh, yeah. That guy singing to him? - Did you see that? - Oh, yeah. I guess he's saying &quot;All right!&quot; It really clearly Yeah, it sounds like - It sounds like Biden's saying it? It wouldn't make sense in the context, 'cause it's literally just - What were they singing? It was from, like... a musical or something. What's up with that trend? - Going up to someone and singing? - I was like, &quot;What the...?&quot; [JORDAN] 'Cause you do it a lot. - I don't. I don't. that kind of started - I see. I've seen one guy like go up to Mike Tyson and he's like, (as Tyson) &quot;I remember the... I remember you doing thith.&quot; - &quot;I remember you did that before.&quot; [JACOB] All right, one more. OK, one more. Jacob, <i>I feel like nobody's talking <i>in America that <i>the Black population <i>It's one of those <i>close to the communities <i>you would really understand.</i> <i>But if you're not, <i>goes behind the scenes,</i> <i>and you don't really, um...</i> <i>You don't really hear about it much.</i> <i>So studies show that 90%</i> - <i>of the lowest-grade quality of glycine--</i> - That's awesome. <i>in the United States of America.</i> <i>One of the reasons <i>that the government's <i>is to make sure that <i>never figures out about - (all laughing) - This is literally how discourse is. <i>communities forever</i> <i>if we just had that information.</i> I think it helps that the bit is not just-- And not to dissect comedy I've been listening to too many of those Psych. Those are too tiring. There is a lot to the fact that - It's not all the conspiracy video. - of discourse you see on TikTok. - and guy walking. the, uh, the TikTok meme with who is--&quot;It's my--&quot; &quot;It's my birthday today, - Have you seen that?

The man, the myth, the legend. The funniest stand-up comedian The most Italian name in comedy. The guy who's afraid to just say it... Let's just play it. <i>(crowd laughing and whooping)</i> - &quot;Yeah!&quot; - The &quot;woo&quot; is one of the worst. That's a family member. - He looks so afraid. It is--I think we talked about it Like, the setup and lampshading needed for that bit to work isn't setup. It is like a fifth-grader coming up to you and they heard a joke they wanna say. - Yeah. Do you have a car?&quot; &quot;What car is it?&quot; - &quot;I don't, but...&quot; - &quot;Do you know what BMW stands for?&quot; And, like, the guy's - &quot;What was that? I'm sorry?&quot; Also, he's not even... He's not even--like, I'm not... I don't want him to be, but he's not even, he doesn't even seem confident in being - such a fucking idiot about pronouns. He's been a comic of note for like... eight years. - And the nervousness in what he's doing is so... un-- It's unfunny, 'cause I guess &quot;satirical,&quot; If you're doing satirical comedy, the joke is you are so confident - Yeah. (nervous mumbling) - Yeah. the response needed. &quot;Do you wanna hear my pronouns?&quot; - Yeah. - &quot;No, I don't.&quot; &quot;'Cause I was gonna tell you.&quot; &quot;Are you sure you don't want to? - &quot;No, I'm good, man, but thank you.&quot; - &quot;I'm not a plant or anything.&quot; And they're like, &quot;Oh... - All right.&quot; - Like... (sighs) - to say &quot;they/them.&quot; The pronouns thing is something that... some old people are so obsessed with. But even if you're one of these old people that feels like times are changing it's the easiest common-courtesy thing you could do to another person. And the joke is not funny. We started calling Puff Daddy P. Diddy. - And look where that left us. That's a better argument against pronouns. - (all laughing) That's a better joke Um, no, but it's... This joke is so tired, I think that a lot of it going viral is people going, &quot;Wow, really? Still?&quot; - [EDDY] Yeah. It's also just nothing. I did watch a few clips of this guy, I love to chuckle. You know me. - You watch Family Guy. I watched The Joker twice. I had to turn it off the second time. I watched The Joker trailer for the - Yeah. uh, chaos. But... The first clip I saw is him on one of those Stand-Up where you get a-- It's crowd work, but it's just prompts. And one of them is, uh... It's like stores or something like that, and he has to do so much lift to travel across the real estate all the way to... &quot;You ever been there with a woman? What's going on with these women, guys?&quot; The prompt would've In the special I was able before it gave me the - this morning--ruined my morning-- It just made me tired. Was... In the first three minutes... with no, like, - he--comedian destroys feminism; - Right. Got to. - Get 'em. like more specifically. - Hell yeah, dude. touching on that. I don't think feminism's Just women have them, - so I guess that's there as well. if you didn't wanna get got He does that thing that Gervais where he sets it up-- And Jimmy Carr does this as well, He does one semi-ironic joke, I guess, 'cause he doesn't? I don't know - &quot;That's a little thing called 'irony.' You better get used to that And that doesn't... - do any of those jokes. - if you're laughing at that one.&quot; I don't know if you guys saw - Conservative comedy one? is that he'll do that, and then go on podcasts &quot;Don't call a joke offensive. Say it offended you.&quot; And it's like, so you're OK, semantics. You got me. [EDDY] Yeah, and it's... (sighs) &quot;Don't say you don't like my comedy. Say that you thought &quot;That my comedy wasn't... My comedy isn't bad; - Right. OK, well, one star still. (all chuckling) What have you cooked up [JACOB] So, we've got (all laughing) Jacob actually already [JACOB] Yeah, you can kinda just - conspiracies, ableism, transphobia. [JACOB] Yeah, Joe Rogan. These are all links that Jacob pulled - that nobody's responding to. Just.. &quot;Hey, guys, I switched to Android, so there may be an issue with these coming [JACOB] Yeah. And then a couple-- - Rocket League gameplay? It's one where it's just his visuals, - but the sounds of Rocket League. I gotta say, I'm sorry, the one caption that's in the thumbnail &quot;Victorian hooker outfit.&quot; - That's great. &quot;Saw a time traveler&quot;? - [JACOB] A little. I watched--in the same vein that he's riffing on pronouns, or have a lot of interest When he starts doing I think at one point It's when he's doing the circuit on those, you know, any Tom Segura-adjacent podcast called, like, &quot;Real Bastard Shit,&quot; &quot;[No-Holds-Barred] Radio.&quot; That's what he's doing, because it's... It's long-form. You can't do the It's funny to be like, but then be like, &quot;Uh, - Can we watch what he says? - Nazi UFO clips? [JACOB] Yeah, this is <i>Have you ever - <i>Neuschwabenland? - No.<i> <i>Operation Highjump?</i> - His attitude is actually. hilarious. He's back in his - &quot;Do you like Hot Wheels?!&quot; &quot;Have you ever seen Cocomelon?&quot; &quot;Do you like the Simpsons?&quot; <i>...Operation Highjump?</i> <i>So, at one point,</i> <i>some people are like, <i>So they send this cat <i>up to investigate</i> <i>with a giant... fleet,</i> <i>like just a fleet to go bang, bro.</i> - <i>And according to his journal--</i> - He's a horrible storyteller. - It's incomprehensible. - What the hell?! Well, I always don't wanna credit because I think one of the things is, uh, I think some people who in those algorithms themselves, Someone like Elon, I think, and then bought the website Um, but... My guess is, because he's not... You know, he's done more if you're not that successful you probably get resentful, some crowds don't laugh You're bombing. All comics bomb. I mean, you can even tell-- Like, what the fuck are you talking about? He also--what did he call the person? He didn't say &quot;this guy.&quot; - Oh, &quot;this cat.&quot; - Yeah, OK. - &quot;This groovy cat.&quot; - &quot;We're not with the fleetie-pie.&quot; - (all laughing) Can we back up a little? truly, it's hard to follow his logic. <i>...Admiral Byrd up to investigate</i> - This groovy cat. - <i>like, just a fleet to go bang, bro.</i> &quot;A fleet to go bang, bro.&quot; - OK. So... wait. - So--OK, sorry. God, he's so bad at this. I would say maybe let him - 'Cause I'm still confused. very important elements to this. - [EDDY] Yeah. &quot;Have you ever heard of,&quot; like, - It was like &quot;New&quot;--I don't even know. &quot;Operation Highjump.&quot; &quot;They sent this cat... over to Antarctica&quot;? - &quot;With a big fleet to go bang.&quot; - what government. I'm assuming-- - It's &quot;to go bang.&quot; <i>Have you ever heard of Neuschwabenland?</i> (all erupt into laughter) - Brendan [Schaub's] house, dude. It sounds like he's - &quot;Schwaben my balls on your face.&quot; - &quot;Nooo!&quot; &quot;What's Neuschwabenland?&quot; &quot;Neuschwaben my balls across your chin.&quot; Dude, that was too confident. - He'd be like, &quot;New-sl--fuck!&quot; - (gulps) &quot;Schwab?&quot;<i> <i>- You never heard of Neuschwabenland? <i>Have you ever heard of It's just this for nine minutes. &quot;Have you ever heard of (all laughing) <i>At one point, some people are like, - &quot;Some people.&quot; The president. - &quot;Some people.&quot; Harry S.

Like, just a <i>And according to his journal <i>he... he...</i> <i>basically met with UFOs--</i> (Jarvis &amp; Jordan losing it) &quot;Basically met with UFOs.&quot; - They went bang, if you can believe it. Keep playing. by &quot;basically met with UFOs.&quot; <i>...basically met with UFOs.</i> <i>- Nazi UFOs. <i>- Yes. <i>- The Nazis-- <i>Had made a deal, basically, working with--</i> <i>- What?! <i>- No! I'll take your word for it, mate, This guy is just--he's dumb. He saw a conspiracy online. - He's trying to recite it to Joe Rogan. He didn't think, into even the initial thing Even adding details - [EDDY] Yeah. A fleet to go bang, bro! A fleet to go bang, - and then they found his journal later. &quot;Nazi, big space guy.&quot; And then in the written words, - What's he mean, &quot;basically&quot;? (laughs) They went bang. - (Eddy laughing) - Like, &quot;My favorite ship, going bang.&quot; [JACOB] I think this is related. (laughs) Yeah. - How would you know, really? that the TikTok included more context of whatever, like... like, Joe at least even responded with, like even after, if he had gone, like, &quot;That doesn't make any sense,&quot; or if he had gone more I feel like this is - too far even for Joe Rogan. like he's kidding, but he's also Yeah, he's--he is... truly incredulous that And we don't know why We don't know what the fuck I don't know--maybe I just about uh, flat... Why is the logo - Oh, LA upside-down? 'Cause... Frickin' dude, come on. - If we have to explain it, it's not... Um, sorry. I'm writing down (laughs) I'm just trying to think about-- With Eddy in the thumbnail. (all laughing) [JACOB] &quot;The dumbest (Eddy &amp; Jordan laughing) &quot;Dogshit YouTuber.&quot; [JACOB] Um... yeah. &quot;The N-word comedian is very dumb.&quot; - (Eddy &amp; Jordan laughing) - So what's this other conspiracy thing? [JACOB] Yeaaaaaahhh. Wait, the--who is German-born? - At an American national park? Which now makes me think about - Schwabenland. - Ah. OK. Yeah, what--what always confuses me about these people is that, like, usually, and I'm not saying-- Well, I guess we could probably assume Usually, the people that get are also alt-right. And it's so weird to me They... somehow think, that this old, like, horrible party has now infiltrated... like, through all these and is still pulling the strings. &quot;You guys probably know a few Nazis.&quot; They're always so invested in... uh, &quot;clues&quot; in language or semantics, or unnecessary details that, when they look at - &quot;National Socialist Party,&quot; that's enough. It's like a clue. Oh, I didn't know the-- Oh, Operation Paperclip - That is a real thing that happened. I just wish everyone would put, like, energy that they do even bipartisan. Like, uh, congressmen who get to We all even agree on that. Maybe let's put all that But that's... everybody, uh-- Yeah, the meme of, uh, like the two hands shaking. - Yeah. - &quot;corrupt people&quot;? Instead it is, like... you know, &quot;ghetto-style corrupt people.&quot; &quot;Obama-style Kendrick-folk.&quot; And you'll be surprised to find out that it's actually a domino effect; that we got Obama Yeah! (laughing) - A time-traveling Hitler alien. They know how They know that they Because those are the rules. The same way that, like, Kanye, even for Infowars, you're kinda not allowed I was gonna say that in, like, the... like... how bad he is at-- I mean, he's like worse Alex Jones, but now I'm thinking, &quot;Oh, would - Yeah, for sure. I don't wanna give this guy but we're also seeing these and his... His tone is very odd to me. Like, it sounds like he's kidding, but I don't think he's kidding. he's trying to be a little fun, But also it's just such a short, like, cut-up of that conversation. I think Rogan is somebody who loves platforming these conspiracies, and has a history of but also, I think, likes to push back on them a little bit. And so when it's a comedian, but they're way too into it - he's gotta joke. Yeah, he's gotta be like, &quot;Oh, And then says the most OK, wait. Let's watch - that you mentioned. Yeah. - (Jordan snorts) from the DC show where, uh, the DC gorilla visits Obama's dorm room. - (all laughing) Uh, by the way, - I just remembered. Oh, this is his official page. - [JACOB] I think so. [JACOB] All of these have been off of either his official page, - OK, got it. We gotta read the bio on that page. &quot;Spiritual Gangsta.&quot; &quot;Dangerous Man.&quot; - I think that's his Twitter bio. - Can we go to his Twitter? Right, but I wanna confirm that he really runs with - as a self-identifier. Oh, and then a shoutout - &quot;Spiritual Gangster,&quot; yeah. He's gonna (inaudible). Me when I pass people (all laughing) &quot;I saw Dracula!&quot; (Eddy &amp; Jordan laughing) &quot;Hand to God, men with - &quot;And guns are the problem?&quot; He's wearing an &quot;anti-vaccine - vaccine club&quot; hoodie. I love people wearing I have not seen that enough everywhere. Right, no, 100%. I wanna see it more. What I love... Ah, I love to imagine going into my big, spacious walk-in closet and seeing a smorgasbord - &quot;my pronouns are attack/helicopter&quot; or the Supreme logo, He sees a naked man on the street, and he's like, &quot;I saw... - Adam from Adam and Eve.&quot; &quot;Swear to God, he's walking around.&quot; &quot;He didn't have his leaf - &quot;I went--&quot; &quot;I was near a convention center... You're not gonna believe this. All the &quot;What the hell?&quot; &quot;I think it takes place on Neushabenland.&quot; Uh-huh. (Jordan laughing) Right. (snorts) So he's mentioning Wait, is he--so, did he post this as-- What's the caption of this TikTok? Oh, it's him &quot;destroys women,&quot; &quot;Sam Tripoli gets a working woman.&quot; So is he just joking about 'Cause then he starts [JACOB] But it seems like - seriously say. I cannot gauge whether or not this guy is I think he's kidding here, but... But he's wearing that anti-vaccine thing, It's also not a funny joke. - Like, it's just not. I'm just picturing this guy-- - [JARVIS] Is it a joke, is my question. I mean, that feels like, in this context, he might even present the or whatever it was called, more of a bit on his show, Well, we also don't know the 'cause it's like the TikTok bit. - I'm just confused. You're like, &quot;You're not letting him [JARVIS] We need to know how and also, how did it switch from a picture - to Dwight Eisenhower on the second one? &quot;So, they asked him,&quot; and he's Uh, that was Harry S. Truman Eddy, you are more of a (laughing) I'm more of a-- I think right now, we're actually just doing research, so I'm more of like, Not for his conspiracy, but just for him. - I can't gauge this guy at all. just for my own fact-checking, go back to the very first conspiracy one where they say, like, - <i>...going on with Antarctica?</i> I know my presidents. And then... - That's my president. during, uh... during the bombing. - But, like, end of World War II. - or bomb or something. What did he say? &quot;A fleet to go...&quot; - &quot;Bang.&quot; [JORDAN] &quot;Bang Bus.&quot; OK, great. So Eisenhower Um, so it could be connected, but I was still confused. It's... also, I think... I don't wanna give a note to this guy, but if he were to start with, maybe, missing people in national forests, that's probably your &quot;in,&quot; [JARVIS] Yeah. You would think a stand-up would be so that the audience - So, now that we've seen-- Do you guys think--I think the, um... pronoun video is completely set-up. Like, I think the audience And also, the &quot;woos&quot; and everything, it just feels like a like everyone in the audience. I feel like you'd hear a groan - just 'cause the joke sucks. from these guys are , 'cause all you need is, what, 25 people - to go to the Cellar on an open-mic. You need to book 30 minutes. Yeah, if you had they/them pronouns, and then he said, &quot;Since we're right after saying the N-word, - you wouldn't be like... You can see his confidence 'cause initially he's going, (stammering) &quot;I'll respect your ones, Then they laugh and they go, (aggro) If you look at everyone here, everyone seems like or he asked the crowd, This just does not seem like... a regular crowd that didn't know - Sold out, though, dude. Yeah. I just wonder, like-- It's one of those things where, even legit he is in his own beliefs, or if he's just kind of a grifter. - I don't know what the hell he's doing. The pronoun one, or the number of... Look, I know some people, uh-- I'm very good friends with some people as we all do, but enjoy and maybe that I think are a little far-fetched. But typically, if it's... aliens or the paranormal it's usually motivated by interests, fun. It's interesting. and get bought in. Maybe a member of their family However... there is a clean line, and... conspiracy theories just as a portal - to doing hate you already feel. And the pronoun--it's so cynical and lazy that it almost doesn't feel real. Even the, what was it? &quot;Broken Simulation&quot; - brand-type thing... - I'm like... &quot;You don't care about this.&quot; His heart's not even in it - [JARVIS] Yeah. [JORDAN] Now, when you do it? Ooh, it's so loud! It's like you've committed to this path... Jordan's like, &quot;When you do it, (all laughing) Wait, I wanna know more I don't know why I love accusing you - of awful behavior so much. You do that to me, that you being British - is like this awful thing. - [JORDAN] That balances out. - &quot;Did he tell you, by the way?&quot; (mimicking) &quot;O-kay.&quot; - What? I'm an advocate for, uh, mental health, and, like, I don't (all laughing) I think a proper diagnosis - &quot;O-kay.&quot; - Is he doing South Park impressions? &quot;O-kay.&quot; Ugh, this is such... I was wondering if they'd &quot;I know we're on camera but there's a couple of looks - that would get me to cheat on her.&quot; - &quot;She knows.&quot; &quot;You love her and but is there one?&quot; - [JARVIS] &quot;There's a couple.&quot; Dude, saying shit like that that's when I know I need to Like, you know, I'm very but there's been times where we've and I've gone, like, &quot;Oh, no, I see what Also, this is a completely Princess Leia? - (chuckles) All right, yeah. Does it just keep going on this? - Let's see. (laughs) Out loud admitting And it's... I don't know. That's not really a You know what it is? It's the same where it's like... There are women in real life, and you are on camera, and I do know you Like, I do know there are moments where there are times in your life where people do not fuck with you and they just pretend like they're 'cause they wanna say what they want. Yeah. Speaking of Fresh &amp; Fit, their world is crashing down right now. - It's awesome. I love it. but I don't know the big... - Oh, uh-- [JARVIS] Yeah, that's uh, Fit or whatever his name is, - Fred Fresh. The one that never uses his actual name. - &quot;Coconuts in Barbados&quot; guy. He, uh, got an escort pregnant. And, uh, then the person, like, leaked... - They had a legitimate relationship, too. He has video of her Yeah, so she came out--like, where she was like, &quot;This was a real relationship for me. You kind of just ghosted all of a sudden, but let's not act like you didn't We talked about a future together.&quot; Uh... All these guys are like that, They are the biggest A modicum of affection, It's really satisfying, Ethan really held them to that. And also, that guy, - [JORDAN] Walter Fit, yeah. 'cause I watched it They, um... Like... He--Walter has bragged - home to meet his mom. But, like, it's-- Yeah, also, they also and then these texts that &quot;We were in a legitimate relationship.&quot; They're all about, like... anti-abortion, keeping the family, keeping two parents, a man and a woman. She's essentially holding him to every-- - He's gotten what he's wanted. It's like... She was like, &quot;Oh, but like...&quot; you know, &quot;I wanna keep the baby. I wanna have a family,&quot; blah-blah. And then he's just completely, uh, goes mask-off and is like, &quot;Oh, actually, He bought the starter pack. He bought the alt-right starter pack, He was like, &quot;I don't want &quot;So I guess then I have Shit. I didn't want all this bullshit.&quot; Well, 'cause I feel like there's-- The only routes, like the... Guys like that, who do the manosphere, like, &quot;I date a lot of women,&quot; um, like, the only sex that they is either something awful, like a crime, or they pretend to not be And they're like, &quot;Oh, And they, like you said, where they're like, &quot;Oh, I promise--I know I didn't mean it. - I know, and-- because the actual personalities Yeah, they're extremely unfuckable. - [JORDAN] Yeah. I believe her name's Daisy. 'Cause I don't wanna just I believe her name's Daisy. Uh, she was talking about how &quot;people in my life warned me about you. They said that I shouldn't, and I followed my heart, and also you were never using protection. Why are you suddenly acting like you're not aware of the consequences?&quot; This--I will say, very quickly--is... This... criticism of her does not - This is separate. But also, you gotta, in some way, be like, &quot;Why did you follow your heart - Yeah. But I will say, if you followed I would've assumed that because that's what they say publicly. But I would've assumed he But again, it's like - Yeah. or detractive statement I could make She also cooked his ass - It's awesome. She's great. - She's great. More power to her. - I don't wanna endorse anybody. can work, because it seems like you know, the pitch is basically, - [EDDY] Mmhmm. I've had friends in the past-- that've been in those relationships, and for a period of time seen that partner as, like, &quot;It's a pragmatic thing. or &quot;It's the way they grew up,&quot; &quot;but with me they can access The reality is, no. That is as authentic because the truth is that spending all their time performing that, - [EDDY] Mmhmm. mostly unsuccessfully performing this, and when they are unsuccessful, which then transfers into that character being &quot;Ah, it's just a persona. - I'm only boring with you!&quot; - Also--sorry, what? I was just gonna say-- but I wish, like a driver's test, I wish you had to just... for having sex, before you have sex, you have to just a yes or no, of... &quot;If someone gets pregnant, And if you say no, you're not allowed. - [JORDAN] Yeah. Chastity belt. Uh, why am I forgetting-- - Child support. Sorry. &quot;When you have to support a child, But, like, I guess that's the But it's just like... Even to just be like, You're signing that responsibility away - For the love of God. Like... &quot;Well, if you got pregnant, It's like he's almost She's like, &quot;There were four other girls you were sleeping with unprotected?&quot; Which also is a huge hazard if you're not communicating with And she really, like, she was like, - (Jarvis laughing) I don't wanna--she did - [JARVIS] She did say that. I wanna go directly to I know you think... you're the one where it won't go wrong. I know you think... &quot;Eh, I don't have a condom with me. You're not the guy. (laughs) - [EDDY] Also, I'll say-- I don't think any of those guys [JORDAN] Come on. The fellas! - [JORDAN] The bloody boys. Can I speak to our demographic, that And then Myron, uh, there's clips of Myron - talking about-- He threw a mug against the ground. I thought you were saying - No. Actually, it's really-- - I mean-- If there's anything to learn from seeing-- Actually, can we pull up that clip - Or do you not want the beef? - I think they're going through enough. it's no better proof when you see If you are one of these shitty manosphere people, or just regular, in your life, just like a horrible misogynist... you will be alone when you get old. - [JARVIS] Yeah. You can call yourself cool. And then they will maybe either and you will either, (A) be alone at night when you're older, or (B) be in a very unhappy torturing somebody that you're with. - So for the love of God-- - you don't know. You don't understand. And it's just like there's-- You see the clip of Myron &quot;Their life has been extremely difficult because they've chosen this path.&quot; And then they'll... &quot;My life's fuckin' awesome. Or when they're kicking someone off Yeah. Kicking off somebody got drunk, and then are like, - about OnlyFans.&quot; Like, halfway deep in their Solo cup. I'm just so exhausted with this shit. It's like, how many times I mean, I think the bigger problem They're always gonna find a new audience. &quot;Myron got angry defending Fresh, - breaks the Punisher cup, epic rant.&quot; <i>...absolutely fucking destroy us.</i> <i>You know who was around me the <i>So you motherfuckers can say <i>I'm not going anywhere.</i> <i>I'm gonna stand by <i>'cause you fucking pieces of shit aren't <i>You pieces of shit <i>when I'm fucking figuring out</i> <i>what the fuck I'm gonna do <i>You motherfuckers weren't there when <i>You motherfuckers weren't there when <i>You motherfuckers <i>and said that I got her pregnant <i>And then you dumbasses, <i>believe some bitch that makes <i>You fucking idiots!</i> <i>I'm not going anywhere!</i> <i>I'm <i>These guys were <i>I'm not gonna fucking leave them <i>Fuck you motherfuckers! I got my <i>I'm not going anywhere!</i> <i>I can't be bought!</i> I wish I could become a ghost for a night and whisper when he's &quot;You've had these horrible times and you could just &quot;You can't improve, I don't wanna say it, but... - He seems a little emotional. Oh, I'm sorry. - Kinda weird. Also, what is the criticism of, &quot;Hey, all the people that don't listen Of course I wasn't there. Your show sucks. Of course now he's got these because he's gone through all these and the harm that - [JARVIS] Yeah. - [JORDAN] Shit. And both of theirs are, because you built a foundation that was - rotten and horrible to its core. But on the bright side, you do have - &quot;Myron hitting mid-life crisis.&quot; The entire time, all it is is that and &quot;lol&quot; and just &quot;L.&quot; And that is what would revealed for if you're one of these guys. - [JARVIS] Yeah. It's not having sex every single night. - [JARVIS] Yeah. I still don't know how you can-- &quot;We go clubbing and sex - strong family values.&quot; Like, you can do those things in our view but not theirs. That's the thing. They said to themselves, to get our money up, get your funny up, and... but also, you know, like... Women shouldn't have a job.&quot; - &quot;Like, I'm not insane.&quot; is that men can actually do It's just--I don't know. - Um-- - dress like Don Draper. Other fun things are that which I think is really funny. That's that guy, right? - The Punisher? He killed the Punisher? And I think at the end of the day, the reason that men is because, like... - glycine production is hidden from them, and they don't know what's I assume that they're using a domestic, maybe Texas-based That's the biggest problem. America And that's why today's episode of Sad Boyz And Daisy, their person - Get your glycine up, fellas! - Yeah, made-- Yeah, grab yourself maybe Make sure it's from that This episode was also - Red 40: It's red, and it's for ya. That's what the 4 in 40 stands for. - It's why Eddy's pee was red. Don't forget to grab a hot, steaming bowl of Prime. Don't drink it. It hurts. Put it in the microwave. Steam it up nice. It'll be like a soup that hurts you. - Mm, yum. I do wanna look at other stand-up of that guy, because because his normal talking is so bad. And we know his N-word joke is bad, but what if he's doing a topic He's looking good. Wow, he really... He managed to add Yeah, no, he's gotta fit it in. - That was impressive. - Ugh. Like, this one had a little bit more regular crowd work structure. But you can tell He's like, &quot;I gotta work in this edgy bit, I think part of the appeal You are just... It's almost like insurance, where you need to-- - &quot;Oh, I don't have a bit for this.&quot; &quot;What will at least get 'Cause anything's better - than a long pause. Interestingly, this clip ended - It looked kind of sad. He was like, &quot;I hope your bus 'Cause people are &quot;Oh, you're gonna walk out?&quot; &quot;Well, I don't have a funny joke. - It's just people leaving. Also, why was a guy just shouting He thought he was Joe Biden. It's interesting, because... I know, you know, uh... better-meaning comedians - can be heckled as well, but... - in my-- Everybody gets heckled, (laughs) In my brain, he did Also, it's, you know... If there's anything you have Speaking of default bits, - just do his age. I don't know. - &quot;Joe Biden!&quot; to just heckle someone - Yeah. Um, did we have another clip Also, sorry I looked at You said something but I looked up and I wasn't - I'm so sorry. - to look things up. It's fine. I'll say that's a small detour not only with my video, but did you guys when you're kinda sucked into your phone, maybe on Discord with somebody, and you notice your - and then you go, &quot;Oh, I'm so sorry&quot;? Like, my brother Tony and I talk about it, where we'll have a, &quot;No, I'm listening,&quot; and then we'll stop immediately My brain was trying to, like, pretend that I was in attention, but I was really so out of it. It's like a skill you develop - ignoring your parents. Imagine if that was in your glasses. And you were looking dead at somebody, - &quot;I was listening to Jimmy.&quot; - Jimmy Beast. - so I'm really excited about that. - I did watch about a third of a special from two years ago, - I watched the No Lives Matter special. Um, tell you what... That's better than &quot;all,&quot; as a sentiment. - (laughing) pretty--in like the first minute he says, &quot;And so I named this and I think he was thinking There is a moment. &quot;'Cause it--yeah, and what's going on with that?&quot; You know? So it's not like a nihilism statement; - he just wanted to have praise? Oh, these are awful thumbnails. Damn. - They're bad. - the Broken Simulation thumbnail. - They got a little Coneheads. I've never really seen Coneheads, - Pretty cool. Broken Simulation would be - [JACOB] Right. Like, I like whenever Gabrus - with Anthony Atamanuik. And it's like, fun, riffing, and one of them is just like, really into conspiracies It's the guy who did, uh, - He was the Trump impressionist. That's what's fun - Yeah. It's actually a lot where you have a very basic, but you know that - it means more, or something. Also, can I say, very smart move of him to put a hashtag on your That way, people know Oh, that's right. And I won't forget. And he has a shoutout Are they--? Still don't know what they are. - [JACOB] Right. - to describe them. (all laughing) (as Trump) &quot;You can - (all laughing) We just watched another one of So on that note, the show is over. - (Jarvis &amp; Jordan laughing) 'cause we are going to be - Eddy's joining us for, uh, a very special episode of Nightz. What was the &quot;millennial - I was just curious about it. What? - That's--this is hilarious. Interesting phrasing in there. Like, &quot;This is why people It's not just 'cause I don't like it.&quot; - I do like, uh, an intervention. - AND there are bad effects.&quot; when you drink coffee. I was thinking of this guy who used to - who does a good Redditor impression. This guy--this guy really is, (Jarvis &amp; Jordan laughing) (all laughing) But with that being said, we end every episode of Sad Boyz - We love you. - And we're sorry. (outro music)
