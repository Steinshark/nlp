[Cosmic burst as spacecraft breaks lightspeed] [Spacecraft makes a deep rumble as it enters the planet's [Alien creatures casually chirp to one another] [Eye piece scanner beeps in fast succession. It pings with [The drones beep and hum as they wake up] [Drones chatter in a coded language] [Broken electronics arc and spark] [Loud metallic thud and crashing] [Captain Tye] [Stormtrooper] I've got it mostly working. Mostly, sir. Well can you fix it? Yes sir. Well just see that you do, Yes sir. And trooper, just get on with it will you? Yes... sir. And rest assured, if this cargo is damaged in any way, [Commander Birnn] Frightened?! It's just... I would much prefer not to wake up one night and find my You're an officer of the Galactic Empire. Even the Hutts Well somebody would! Pull yourself together man! You've been on edge since we left Ryloth. It just so happens I sent out a distress beacon before we Knowing who's overseeing this transaction I'm sure he'll And if whatever shot us down finds us before help arrives? We are Imperial Officers! We have authority here! Anyone who crosses us will feel the Besides, we still got troopers. [Stormtrooper] Bounty Hunter scum... [Control panel pings to life] [ID scanner buzzes in error] (speaking foreign tongue) [Drone hum approaches nearby] [Drone chatters in coded langauge] [Sirik] Easy! Throw down your other blaster. Now. You see, I don't think that would work out too well for me. The outer rim can be a dangerous place and you never know Surely you won't wish me so disarmed? After all, I'm rather attached to my blasters and seeing as See this? I've never missed a shot with this. I take it you'd like me to stop talking then? What's your name, Twi'lek? Name's Ja'kar. I'm a bounty hunter. Wrong. Guild members don't attack Imperial transports. Nor do they make unsanctioned kills. These men had it coming-- Also, I figure you for a liar. You some kind of Imperial sympathizer? I don't work for the Empire, nor anyone else for that matter. I'm guessing you do though. I'd wager you're one of those Rebels Blaster. Now. [EMP charge beeps] [Electricity zaps the rifle and Sirik's eye piece] Seems I've touched a nerve. So enlighten me Twi'lek... You grew up on a slave colony no doubt. Tortured by the Empire or one of the So, you joined a group of fanatics Some sense of meaning? Revenge? Maybe it wasn't YOU they hurt. Maybe it was someone you loved. You don't know what's in that crate, do you? -I don't care! Listen! This isn't about war... or profit. An innocent life is at stake. Look, you're right about me. I'm no bounty hunter... but I know bounty hunters have a code. Some even a conscience. So please... No bounty is worth... I AM NOT LEAVING WITHOUT THAT CARGO! [Thermal detonator clicks under pressure. [E11 blaster clicks with empty cartridge] Clever. Disarm it and you can keep your head. How do you expect me to do that? Don't play games with me! These detonators have a remote that can also turn them off. Deactivate it, NOW! That's not mine. If I wanted you dead, I'd have shot you by now. Then why haven't you? A dead Twi'lek doesn't fetch much on the slavers market. So, here's what's going to happen next. You're going to-- [Ringing in Ja'kar's ear after explosion] [Muffled creatures far off in background churp and chatter] [Boots spurs approach] Of course. Of course it's you. Seeing as I'm so reasonable... I'm going to give you one chance to walk away. I'm not leaving without that cargo. And... I've still got my good hand. [Static crackles as hologram switches on] [Admiral Ardurrn] [Boba Fett] Your reputation proceeds you. Although, bounty hunters were not my first choice. That call was made by a much higher order than my own. I expect to be paid in full. You'll get your credits. Just ensure the cargo is delivered to the Black Sun The Twi'lek in that crate is of great value to the Empire. I needn't remind you that your discretion regarding this Should you breach the terms of our agreement what that disintegration of yours feels like. A squad will await you at the rendezvous point.
