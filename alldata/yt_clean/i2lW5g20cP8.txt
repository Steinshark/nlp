Thanks to Wren for sponsoring this video. Have you ever been relaxing? Just enjoying an episode of Kitchen WAKE UP. YOU WAKE UP! IDIOT. ***** when you think to yourself, Hmm, I wonder if this place is still open, I might want to go try it out one day if I'm ever that I've never been to before, only to find out with leftover Yelp reviews that only mention their episode on Kitchen regardless if positive or negative. and I don't know if that's just something, but I'm willing to bet that most of you out there have done the same thing. Kitchen Nightmares followed 7 Michelin star Scottish, hunky, talented, tall, handsome chef Gordon Ramsay through his endeavors to visit failing restaurants across the United States, to, at the end of the episode, improve the terrible food, atmosphere and management, and set the failing business And because the restaurant was now tied to Gordon Ramsay's name, there's always a boost in customers after the Ramsay Renovation, that's the new show on HGTV. Ramsay Renovation. He had a separate Kitchen Nightmares show in the UK first, but we'll get to that later. Kitchen seven years from September 2007 to September 2014. So basically my entire awkward phase. they visited 77 restaurants across 92 episodes, including revisits, and as of today, mid 2022, guess how many of those 77 episodes are still open? Maybe 25 or maybe half of them NO. 15 are still open to this day. Most of the places closed of the episode airing, with many, many of them closing before their episode even aired. And I wanted to know why. I cross-checked this data myself, it was outdated So this information is updated, there are 15 restaurants still open that were featured on the show. So these restaurants were made to seem that for sure. 100% of the restaurants that were on Kitchen to close down for good without Gordon Ramsay's help. What's the debt? About 850. 850,000??? And you've only been open for 18 months. Right. What in the f*** have you been doing? So with 15 of those still open, are they only surviving because of Gordon Ramsay's help? Are the other restaurants fault or inability to help properly? Or does the management after Gordon leaves, I mean, it's hard to believe that true change of heart and often very stubborn management causing the downfall can be improved for longevity in just the few days that Gordon is there helping them. That's like speed running human emotions. So for us to investigate, first we must understand the Kitchen Nightmares formula. Oh yeah, there's a formula. It is a reality show overall And if you've binged any amount of Kitchen episodes, you might notice that they all nearly happen the exact same way every single time. Gordon Ramsay visits a failing restaurant somewhere in the US, he meets the owners, he sits down, has lunch, spitting out the food, sending it back, roasting the interior design and filth of the place as he waits for the next food item, then he yells at the owners and staff about how gross the food is. In the evening, Gordon observes their dinner service, Then inspects the kitchen and ingredients during dinner service, sometimes stopping service if what he finds is too dangerous. Like any living creature meat near other food, basically anything Not sure why he decides during the dinner service and not before the chaotic dinner service with a hundred people in the dining room when the staff probably hasn't seen more than one family at a time Anyway, then he yells at the staff after dinner service about the service Sometimes followed by a more calm with the owners other) About their financial problem or the more in-depth reason that the restaurant is failing. Overnight, Gordon's team the restaurant's interior and signage. The next day, the owners are revealed to their new restaurant, and new menu on, often completely throwing away the old menu. By this point, the owners or problem characters in the episode has suddenly had a change of heart and is now accepting of Gordon's help after being the most insufferable, arrogant narcissist literally the day before. He has no idea what he's talking about, so, whatever he has to tell me, I don't really care. To try to get everything I can to have somebody like that show you... awesome...you know, for him to come in, I needed to get back into it. He actually did. He, you know, made me feel like I wanted to cook again. Now Gordon lets the staff taste and learn the new menu. Then they prepare for the second dinner service with issues and menu improved. There's a problem in the middle of dinner but they typically finish out Gordon does a little frantic peepee dance, and everyone's happy and Gordon leaves. Then sometimes we'll get the camera crew revisiting the restaurant a few months later to check in, and everything is usually seemingly good most of the time. And the episode ends, and that's how most of the episodes go. There are two standouts from this formula that come to mind. I know that there's more, but these two don't quite follow the formula exactly. But first, you might be wondering how much of this show is staged, how much of it is complete baloney, fake, ratatouille. Can that be a new synonym? I mean, over the 90, whatever episodes they have all follow this exact formula. And most of the problem characters on the show of heart overnight. I don't buy it. Well, I did some digging. I did a lot of digging. I went into so many articles and even some Quora forums, Quora, Quaara, Quora, Quora forums from former production crew. Who the frog uses Quora any more? Who ever used Quora? I'll spare you the reading and give you the CliffsNotes. You're welcome. Basically, the show is mostly real with some swaying by the producers. Mostly everything that you see on the show actually happens. I speak feline! mrow mrow meow :3 With some exceptions, where the producers actually faked aspects of the episode, but far less than what you might think. In the episode when they visited Finn McCool's in the Hamptons. First of all, your last name is McCool? That's Alpha behavior. You were born with that. Finn of House McCool at your service. It sounds like a fake name that you used to sign up for a website you don't really care about. Finn McCool is the true alpha male. Anyway, in this episode there's a kitchen staff and then picks it up to put it back in the fryer. Yeah, he was a plant. He was a friggin plant. They hired this dude He didn't actually work there. In that same episode, there's a scene where the chef walks out on their family and drives away, which was completely fabricated by the editors, the van waiting outside wasn't even his. It was the plumbers, you know, plumbers have saved more lives than doctors. show some respect. And you know how the first dinner service is always chaotic and the staff is always overwhelmed I'm sorry. Take their food away. Why? Because we're not serving anymore. Well, the producers actually overbook those dining rooms for those dinner services on purpose to create chaos and stress for the staff. On that specific episode of Finn McCool's, the owner said that by about 100 guests, and this was all information with the restaurant owner He's really just a chill Irish guy. He wasn't so I don't think he's about what was fabricated on his episode, though, there is no telling how much more of that type of fakery occurred on the show. When looking at testimonials from the owners and production crew, it didn't seem to happen All the human emotions are completely real, but the catch is that the producers purposefully push these people to that point on purpose. Perry The platypus pooping on my.... producers pushed the people to the point of emotion on purpose. So it's like putting me in a crowded room and then filming me freak out. And this happens on every reality show. It's not unique to Kitchen Nightmares, like the cast of The Ultimatum and put into these conflicting situations on purpose, in them, There's also this thing called During those talking head interviews, producers ask purposefully provoking to pull a certain, more dramatized response from the person. This happens on the news, reality shows, video and written journalism. It's all on purpose. In fact, I turned in a mini documentary in my film class in college where I interviewed someone, and my professors specifically told me to in the future try to ask more provoking questions on purpose that might be uncomfortable because it leads to a better and more captivating story. And he's absolutely right, though BEFORE the assignment, but whatever. TLDR Most of it is absolutely real. For example, during the Blackberry's episode. We'll get to that episode later, was 100% real and Gordon just picks it up by the tail with his bare hands. Why? Gordon... Former production team member, said that the show is entertainment and while nobody is faking emotion, the way the show is made puts their hearts on their sleeves. I'm stopping the video real quick to tell you I collabbed with @raptrading to create this really cool card. It's on sale now at raptrading.co. They really killed it with this design, so I'm really proud of it. Now you can say, hey, if you've activated my cringe card the cringe collector, so make sure you get that raptrading.co really cool collab So thanks back to the video. so I mentioned earlier how there are two stand out episodes from the formula and these episodes on opposite extreme ends of the spectrum will help us find out if Gordon is partially at fault for 62 of the 77 restaurants he tried to help completely failing. They're also just fun to watch. But I digress. And I say partially at fault here Gordon could be fully responsible for a restaurant's failure because these restaurants were all doomed to fail before they were even on the show. You're losing half a million dollars What's the debt? About 850K. Buddy is in debt, somewhere in the hundreds of thousands. My father's invested everything he has into this business. His whole life as a cop, and retirement and pension It's gone. If we don't get this restaurant going, we're going to have to sell our home. That's why they got on the show, actually. But that's probably obvious. Anyway, in Scottsdale, Arizona. Dude. These people were so insane that this is the first and only restaurant that Gordon Ramsay has ever walked out on, on the show. Good luck. They would yell and insult customers- &quot;You f*** out from here&quot; Do you understand? Amy: Samy? YOU **** **** YOU SIR, GET OUT YOU ******!!!! (ANGRY YELLING) It was crazy. And Amy wasn't even that bad of a chef and was actually a good baker. Amy: Thank you. Gordon: That's beautiful. mmmmm, God. The issues with the restaurant were obviously the owners. They would yell at the staff- Amy: 4B, no no no, 5B, Katie: Amy: You don't need to question me, Katie, Send Katie home right now. Katie: No! Samy: no, no no it's okay. Amy: I don't need an attitude from her. She comes in and says, are you sure? Katie: it's because there's the 2 others fights with customers and not give tips to the servers. They would just keep the tips. Gordon: Good tips? Server: I don't make tips. Gordon: Say that again? Server: I make hourly. Gordon: Serious? Gordon: So where do the tips go? Server: The owner. Gabi: Even the producers jumped in to stop the conflict at one point. Even the producers thought, No, this is too much. And that episode was 100% real. After this episode aired, Amy's Baking Company went viral and patrons would travel to go visit the restaurant for themselves to see if it was really as it appeared on TV. And it was. Every blogger or normal person, You can't, You're either a blogger said, yes, the owners are actually flippin' insane. And while Amy's baking company in 2015, the owners, Amy and Samy are now moved to Israel, and Amy is still baking, posting her pastries on Instagram. What this episode is that some people just can't be helped. Some people don't want to be helped. You might be wondering Gordon Ramsay Well, it was because they blamed problems on the haters and the bloggers. Amy: There's a lot of online bullies and haters and bloggers. And they needed Gordon's help to combat the evil bloggers. Evil, evil bloggers DARN YOU bloggers. And that's what happens. Most of the issues are almost the exact same. Before I get into that, though, the second standout episode of Kitchen is Blackberry's, where I mentioned the mouse earlier. He goes to the bathroom after praying and eating rotten intestines as the owner laughs maniacally. But then the dessert slaps, birthing this iconic clip. Gordon: Finally, some good f***** food. Which wasn't even made by the chefs, It was made by the owner's mother aptly named Mama Mary. Amen. This episode features restaurant in Plainfield, New Jersey, and a little bit of a control freak over the staff. This never changes, though, throughout the whole episode, even though usually they're able to somehow turn the owners into a new person by the end of the episode to accept the new changes. I don't know what the chef is talking about, and a lot of people love it. I do. I eat it. I've been doing this for 37 years. Chef Ramsay was a kid when I first started cooking. I should know a little bit more than he does. Chef Ramsay is a remarkable, I am grateful and thankful to him for coming here and opening my eyes. Mother Mary delivers God-like advice. You just can't close ears to someone that's come to help you. And BlackBerry's sadly closed in March of 2013, just a year and five months after the episode aired. And according to a production team member who worked on that episode, they say BlackBerry's was failing because it had a crack house There weren't enough customers in the neighborhood for a sit down meal. Everybody who went there loved it. She was in high demand as a caterer, to fancy parties and non crack houses. So while the food could have been improved and it was afterwards, it wasn't the reason why the restaurant was failing. or it wasn't the only reason the restaurant was failing. So I think it was obvious, even before I talked about these specific episodes, that of course that these restaurants failed. The similarities of these two episodes both boil down to stubborn owners who don't want to change their menu appearance or try anything new. Gordon: That was dry. Dry pate dry. Amy: It's good like that. We had people tell us all the time.Gordon: And this is true for most of the 77 restaurants that Gordon tried to help. The antagonist of each episode is sometimes comically absurd, but they all share the same qualities. They're stubborn, or take advice from staff. They treat staff poorly. They think highly of themselves arrogant behavior. They think highly of their food, and they don't take criticism well. And are these coincidences that they all share these qualities, just qualities of bad business owners who are the exact type of people to end up on Kitchen Nightmares? Well, let's look at the few businesses that are still open to this day anything that stands out. I compiled every restaurant to see if ownership changed or was sold, if Gordon's improvements were kept and their review rating on Google. And upon reviewing these episodes, I didn't notice anything out of the blue or extraordinary about these restaurants that I thought set them apart from the ones that failed. 11 out of the 15 had what I would consider stubborn and arrogant owners who seemingly changed by the end of the episode, just like all the ones that failed. The other four received the changes well, and were mostly owners who are just simply clueless and had a lack of direction how to run a successful restaurant or didn't have good leadership skills. But that is also true for most of the restaurants that failed too, forfeiting ownership to someone else entirely. And one restaurant is still owned by the same people, but under new management, which greatly improved the place And this is something fun one of the restaurants You can't find their episode Oh, because they sued Gordon Ramsay twice, trying to prevent the airing of the episode back in 2011. And they sued again in 2018 of their episode on social media that made them look bad. Luckily, though, you can still find the Cliff Notes for the episode. I'll put it in the description below. So what the heck was it succeed over the rest? According to Business Insider, according to the National Restaurant according to me, in general, all restaurants, about 30% of restaurants fail in their first year and another 30% fail sometime in the following two years. But then I found a Forbes article saying that only 17% of restaurants close in their first year. So at a rate of 62 out of 77 restaurants that Gordon visited, Google tells me that's an 80% failure rate as opposed to the 17 or 30% failure rate. And this boggled my mind. But then I forgot to consider is only the first year or the first two years. What about the next ten years? What about the next 15 years since Gordon visited the restaurant? Well, I looked into it, and according to this article, that is according to Cornell University State, 70% of restaurants that had opened for business a decade before had failed. So now that 80% failure rate from Gordon's show makes a little more sense when you consider the 8 to 15 year gap since Gordon visited the restaurant. So Gordon's 80% failure rate really isn't that far off the norm in general. A lot of the time, the causes for failed restaurants on the show to overwhelming financial debt that just couldn't be helped. It was too late to save them, even if they started doing better Gordon: how long could you afford to We're in we're in trouble right now. You know, we're probably, I would say, $5,000 a week or $4,000 a week under what we need to survive. A lack of change in management, lack of consistency in the quality of management, staff, food, etc. Sometimes it could even be the location of the restaurant that isn't good. And what a lot of people don't consider is that many of these episodes were filmed around the 2008 where many restaurants So that alone made it harder to get back up on their feet, even if they tried their best And sometimes it'll just take a lot longer that Gordon is there in order to turn the restaurant around for good. Sometimes he'll bring in a temporary chef or accountant. The accountant: A lot of times But running the business itself Gabi: to help them out for a month or two. But there's only so much without completely holding their hand Actually, he left the restaurant, operators at the restaurants went back to the practices that caused their troubles And before you say it, I looked into it, closed during the great P-word of 2020. They all closed years before 2020. The closest one is the 16th Surviving Restaurant Cafe Hon in Baltimore actually closed its doors this year. That was the most recent one, but that was the only one I could find during or after 2020. But honestly, not all parts of running a successful business can even be learned or taught. It is a talent like sure, Ed Sheeran can learn to sing better. (Ed Sheeran's bad childhood singing) But you can't always turn a bad singer into Ariana Grande. You have to have some level of innate talent from the start to be able to just get it and learn from there, you know what I mean? And that's just my opinion. But there's got to be some validity to it. We've all met people who should never run a business do not have the potential or what Like this one dude So he opened another. And guess what he changed? Nothing. He used the same menu from the last one, the same cups, the same everything. And was borrowing money from his stepdaughter to keep the business afloat, absolutely ruining her credit and still couldn't figure out what he had to change in order Obviously, that restaurant closed as well. This guy's a doofus. And with financial ruin aside, We're all doofuses at some things! Sometimes knowing when to quit can be just as honorable as the &quot;keep pushing you can do it&quot; mentality, pursue what you're good at. if you're curious about have closed, luckily, compiling so I didn't have to do It is mostly updated with some exceptions, so just keep that in mind. I had to fact check and update the lists myself for this video. And if you're wondering how these stats compared to the Kitchen Nightmares UK version, Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, that one aired from 2004 to 2014, three years longer than the American version. There are six seasons and somehow only 31 episodes. Clearly, the focus was being put on the American run of the show, which makes sense considering how wildly successful it was. In the UK, Gordon visited 24 restaurants and only 3 of them are open to this day, Google tells me this is a passing rate of 12.5%, and I don't know why most of these restaurants I'm too tired to look into it, but this is a good time for me to bring up how hilariously different the two versions of the show are. There are no words to explain it, so I'm just going to show you a clip [BRITISH VERSION] Gordon: Because 98% But right now as if it's working, Bullshizz, Justin. Richie, it's fugged. Owner: So I really don't know what I'm doing at all. Gordon: so frustrating. [AMERICAN VERSION] Gordon: Pete: I am disagreeing with you. I have- Gordon: We are not 1985, Pete. do you think that your father is serving the best pizza in Denver? Son: Not anymore. I don't think there's anything wrong with the American version. It keeps my little brains attention. It makes everything so dramatic and captivating. That fuggin violin So both UK and US versions of the show gracefully ended in 2014, with Gordon tired of the owners After he leaves them, they close and get it blamed on Gordon. So he said, &quot;I woke up one morning I don't care about the environment. I think I'm doing fine. I ride my bike. Where can I turn off the TV when I'm not using it? What more could you ask for? You're delusional! There are so many And how do I do that, huh? Well, you can start by using the sponsor of today's video, Wren. if you want to offset but aren't sure where to start.
