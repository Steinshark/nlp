[theme music playing] [energetic music playing] <i> We're hitting a grocery store</i> <i> looking for labels Cholesterol free with olive oil. Pomegranate cherry. <i> Armed with a shopping list</i> <i> from some dieticians <i> we're digging into what's <i> and what might be missing [crafty music playing] <i> To find out if these labels <i> or if they're just lousy,</i> <i> we're taking our products <i> Dietician Veronica Rouse <i> Two heart health experts</i> <i> from the University We're going to actually look at and try to decode some of Are you guys -Outstanding. [Charlsie]<i> First up on our list, Tell me, what do you think Well, I see and the words cholesterol free. [Charlsie]<i> <i> to Multi Grain Cheerios.</i> Dietary cholesterol is mainly Aren't all cereals then Yes. [chuckles] Making a statement about when it was never in there is unnecessary and misleading. For instance, well, it never had cholesterol [Charlsie]<i> The Canadian <i> has labelling rules <i> One of those rules?</i> <i> Products aren't allowed <i> they're unique <i> And how about <i> There are CFIA rules And they say specifically, to use heart symbols to suggest or imply is nutritionally superior to or healthier Do you think really lives up It's interesting, the symbolism. It does have this implication that somehow, [Charlsie]<i> <i> To find out, we're heading <i> in Toronto.</i> Now that you know what do you make of the fact this one right here Honestly, I would say, oh, well, That's a very smart move They want to stand out Would you guys call this -now that you know that? -Lazy. [Charlsie]<i> We asked the maker <i> They tell us <i> and that they're committed</i> <i> to clearly <i> the benefits of foods.</i> <i> And next time <i> we spot a new <i> and something's missing.</i> <i> That little heart logo <i> but that questionable <i> is still there, <i> Another label that's got us <i> they sell margarine From a heart-health perspective, what's so great Eating olive oil can help lower improve our blood pressure, reduce our risk and reduce inflammation. [Charlsie]<i> <i> most of the oil The vast majority of this So there's just a little bit [Charlsie]<i> Just how little?</i> We're going to <i> There's about <i> in this entire tub.</i> Here I go. Okay. It's almost there. That amount. So, if you had this whole tub, in terms of you'd have to eat to get the healthy amount We don't want to eat [Charlsie]<i> <i> to the amount of canola?</i> All right, so we'll pour out <i> There's about 290 grams.</i> And let's compare that <i> And the ingredient list <i>There's actually the same amount Why would they maybe be avoiding but they are advertising I think consumers do know a heart-healthy oil, whereas palm oil is and not as high like the olive oil. [Charlsie]<i> The CFIA rules say <i> the importance or presence <i> So, what do shoppers think What catches my eye is it's plant-based, and that it has olive oil, Okay, now, there is a whole lot more -than olive oil. -You look surprised. That is to actually pay attention I feel like [Charlsie]<i> <i> why their label <i> when there is such <i> They tell us <i> and that the percentage <i> on the lid <i> Back on our store shelf <i> Iron Kids Essentials So, Veronica, <i> But look closer.</i> Iron isn't listed Obviously, there's a mismatch in the Iron Kids label Makes you wonder Is this a strong kid If you label it then you might expect that there's some iron in there [Charlsie]<i> Health Canada <i> And when we asked them <i> to call itself Iron Kids <i> they say interpretations <i> So, <i> Some understand Yeah, it's just Yeah, I suppose to being, like, strong kids. [Charlsie]<i> Oh, weird. Why is it iron-free? Someone who doesn't is going to come and say, What are you making Well, so I would expect [Charlsie]<i> But the label meets We asked Health Canada, &quot;It could represent a mineral, but can also be used for example, What do you think of that? In terms of clarity, you could make things [Charlsie]<i> <i> their labels <i> and it's clear that Iron Kids <i> because of the registered <i> They also say <i> can be expected to check <i> to find out exactly what is <i> Next up, Kiju Organic Pomegranates and cherries [Charlsie]<i> <i> tells a different story Well, the first fruit juice instead of and there's no apple Well, that's rather misleading, [Charlsie]<i> Remember, <i> companies can't over-emphasize <i> presence, or absence <i> What do consumers think?</i> It's just trying to scam Kind of misleading. But nothing about apple That's another lousy label. [Charlsie]<i> <i> the image on the label <i> and that apple juice</i> <i> is clearly mentioned <i> But they add <i> of redesigning the package</i> <i> and adding an apple <i> We're getting groceries <i> marketing on food packaging Canada Dry Ginger Ale.

On the American can, its ingredient list It states there's less than But on our Canadian cans, there's no mention of how much only natural flavour. [energetic music playing] <i> Back in Canada, <i> shed more light I've got a question I can see it says But when I look over I don't see ginger So, where is the ginger? Okay, so how much ginger is in a can of Canada Dry? It's proprietary.

We are no different We imbibe the same things, and I feel that perpetrated on us that they feel free in Canada. And get this. Company documents show Canada Dry knew about whether or not in their Ginger Ale. But they decided to focus on real ginger messaging, including in their ads, [country music playing] [indistinct lyrics] [narrator]<i> For a refreshingly <i> grab a Canada Dry Ginger Ale.</i> <i> Real ginger, The ginger in Canada Dry is actually an extract called ginger oleoresin.
