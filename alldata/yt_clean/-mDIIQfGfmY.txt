I gave you four examples and two of them were more of a challenge. Okay, so they were talking in a public setting. They had or a speech written, and they were presenting to featured much younger speakers using a dialect speaking in a setting where nothing was planned, to one, maybe two people in quite an intimate listening practice. Stop watching TED Talks. Talks are great. I love TED Talks, but they are planned and practiced what they are going to say, to understand them. So, of course, you'll be able when you are doing English listening practice, unscripted. Reality shows, podcasts, chat because then your ear is like a muscle. Your ear will be ready to listen to any voice, any dialect. done the hard work. This conversation is easy. I watching for an in-depth analysis of the sounds My next tip involves a strategy that humans have each other, and that is talking to another human I myself have used for the last three and a and most effective ways to improve your English English native.

So go, go, go, practicalities here, because I truly think that fast English is so hard, and it's all because of sounds that everybody does. So let me talk you how to understand them. I believe that the best it yourself. So, learn these linking sounds like your own mouth. Try to actually do them because if linking sounds, it will sound a lot less alien sounds. Okay, so let's look at this sentence here. actually saw a dog in his window on Tuesday. Now, if I say that really quickly? I actually saw a crazy talk. And it's because it's like I'm saying It's just one long word. So, let's talk through &quot;I actually.&quot; Now, no one says, &quot;I actually.&quot; definitely in a lot of accents in the UK, links are based on standard English, but a lot of use these linking sounds. So, when you've got an what we're going to put in the middle it becomes &quot;I actually.&quot; Why do we say &quot;Y&quot;? Let me so we've got an &quot;I&quot; and then we've got an &quot;ah.&quot; &quot;I we have to create a link because they don't really &quot;I&quot; ends wide. Because when we do &quot;i,&quot; it's like &quot;a&quot; and &quot;e.&quot; So, when you've got this wide vowel, then to get to the next word, if it starts with a to. Because our mouth is already wide, and when &quot;yuh.&quot; &quot;Actually.&quot; &quot;Yuh.&quot; And you just release moving on to the next linking sound in this second. I definitely just did an &quot;r&quot; sound. &quot;I Can you? Am I? I can't see an &quot;r.&quot; But I said called an intrusive &quot;r.&quot; Now, if you are only don't worry about the intrusive &quot;r.&quot; But if you you need to understand what the intrusive &quot;r&quot; is. to link to the next word, even though there's not and this can be extremely confusing when definitely heard an &quot;r.&quot; Hold on, there was an just put one in to help with linking. So, let's reason why we're doing an &quot;r&quot; here is because we have another open vowel sound. &quot;Saw a.&quot; So, if we would sound odd. It would sound like &quot;I actually but we don't like putting gaps in when we speak. should rhyme with &quot;door,&quot; right? It's the same There's an &quot;r&quot; on the end. Okay, so actually, this kind of sounds like it ends in an &quot;r,&quot; and that UK dialects if you have a word that could end in an &quot;r&quot; followed by a vowel, we're probably going my name is Laura. Laura. It ends on a schwa, We have mother, father, water, better. Oh, look, spelled like &quot;er.&quot; So, if I have to link my name an &quot;r&quot; in there. So, I say, &quot;Laura is.&quot; &quot;Laura is &quot;r.&quot; Try to make that sound. Get familiar with Imagine you are an actor learning an accent for a definitely understand it when you hear it. So, &quot;In.&quot; Now, the next link is a little bit easier then a vowel. When you've got that hard consonant like it's one word. So, instead of saying, it's like the second part of that sound is &quot;gin.&quot; one sound. &quot;I actually saw a dog in.&quot; Now, the because a lot of the time in the UK, we will drop places like Liverpool, Birmingham. Sometimes, we instead of saying, &quot;in his,&quot; we're probably going away that &quot;h&quot; completely, and we've made it into smush everything together. Everything's just on Tuesday.&quot; Didn't stop once. So, how can you I have one very simple technique for you. I want to singers, everything is connected. Everything like this. There are no gaps in there. So, if we window on Tuesday,&quot; it doesn't have to be a tune, a dog in his window on Tuesday.&quot; Make it one practice speaking in songs. So, read a book, Sing. Connect things together. You've got to want to understand fast English. Okay, moving on spoken English, especially with speakers from the the schwa is everywhere. It's the most common the time, and if you're listening to someone hearing the same sound over and over again, so that was a schwa, but it's an &quot;o.&quot; That was place. Okay, so if you are not familiar, It's not a very cheery sound. It's not Uh, Uh, Uh, Staying alive, staying alive. It's nothing happens with the tongue. &quot;Uh.&quot; In would sound a little something like this. &quot;I was and then an administrator because I love change.&quot; a schwa doesn't have to be one letter. A schwa spot because they just happen all the time. So, these &quot;er&quot; or &quot;or&quot; ending words, that will be a that will be a schwa. Also, the word &quot;for,&quot; a lot go &quot;fuh&quot; A doctor for two years, a teacher for We're just saying &quot;fuh.&quot; Also, the word &quot;was&quot; a doctor.&quot; &quot;I was a doctor for two years.&quot; &quot;I was and an administrator.&quot; &quot;An administrator.&quot; be prepared to hear it, and you have to know when practice. Become, like I said, like an actor sounds. If you are not interested in the sounds understand them when they speak quickly because on to my next tip. So, my next piece of advice waiting for the sentence to have a nice end. Stop speak in sentences. Listen to your own native It's very rare that we have clean sentences that not the same as writing. We get distracted. We and then we say something else. So, if you have a let's say you really want to understand, um, Irish understand the Irish dialect, and you want to then learn what their hesitation sound is. &quot;Eh.&quot; Some people go, &quot;Mm.&quot; Some people go mmm. want the hesitation sound to confuse you, and try to the person's face and their gestures, try to the words they are saying, because most of our So, if I'm talking to you, but I stop, and that I stopped this thought and I moved on to this So, if you watch podcasts, that's really great. so you can watch the person who is speaking because we never talk in sentences. It's very want you to watch anything scripted, because end, beginning, middle, end. But that's moving on. Sometimes it's not that your English are listening to is using new words that you've you think you know, but they've changed it. love contractions. English native speakers do it the things that confuse you. So, for example, the &quot;going to,&quot; we say &quot;gonna.&quot; &quot;I'm gonna love this What about &quot;wanna?&quot; Instead of &quot;want to,&quot; we say This one you might not know, &quot;Tryna,&quot; instead What about &quot;gimme?&quot; &quot;Gimme,&quot; &quot;give me that.&quot; know.&quot; &quot;I don't know.&quot; &quot;I don't know.&quot; &quot;Is not&quot; one you might not know, &quot;Lemme&quot; instead of &quot;let &quot;Init,&quot; instead of &quot;isn't it.&quot; It's lot in the UK. So &quot;it's Tuesday, init?&quot; we're turning that &quot;of&quot; into a schwa. So it's And &quot;dya,&quot; instead of &quot;do you.&quot; People say, &quot;Dya want to go to the cinema?&quot; &quot;Dya want to go to the You've got to be familiar with them because they you when people are talking in fast English. English from native speakers, you need to learn you should be able to do their accent. sounds. You should know what a schwa is.
