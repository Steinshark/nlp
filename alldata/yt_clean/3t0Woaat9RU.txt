But still, it has occupied us Science, too, has grappled with it. It might just be THE BIG QUESTIONS DOES GOD EXIST? <i>It's true.</i> <i>Looking into outer space <i>in the face of its vast dimensions.</i> <i>There are about 100 billion galaxies <i>One of these is our cosmic home, <i>This one single galaxy encompasses <i>Our Earth orbits one of those stars.</i> <i>So far, it is the only planet we know of</i> <i>that has the right conditions <i>I'm not surprised that people question <i>Is there more to it than meets the eye?</i> <i>For example, Having all possible circumstances come together at the same time is about as likely as this... Under the Earth's atmospheric conditions, could a pencil stay Theoretically, it's not impossible. But the airflow would have to be extremely finely synced It's our experience that tells us But if there were a higher power, And there are ideas that say <i>In the beginning, there was darkness.</i> <i>That almost sounds biblical.</i> <i>Only with the Big Bang <i>that make up everything <i>And every star and planet <i>was neither a coincidence, nor random.</i> <i>Because the universe <i>The laws of nature.</i> <i>Like gravity, for example.</i> <i>It stops the planets from straying <i>But it's the so-called natural constants, <i>that determine how <i>in the same way The natural constants, are like great mechanical parts that Essentially, these constants If just one of these constants the following would happen: It would slip out of sync. It would change completely... or disappear entirely. That's why many theologians that the universe is too finely tuned There has to be a plan behind it all. And who made that plan? The cosmic Creator. <i>Does that solve the mystery?</i> <i>Is the finely-tuned filigree <i>proof of God's existence?</i> <i>There are other explanations.</i> <i>What if our universe wasn't the only one?</i> <i>If there were an infinite number <i>That would have to mean <i>is affected by those exact <i>and that is the universe This is where it gets tricky. We could see the intricacy of the universe namely that he created the universe But there are other points of view. Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised otherwise we couldn't exist in it at all. But miraculous phenomena Take a look at those ants. <i>Texas, 2017.</i> <i>Hurricane Harvey swept the nation <i>More than 30,000 people lost their homes.</i> <i>But they were not the only ones.</i> <i>Red fire ants.</i> <i>Thousands of them can interlock <i>The colony can survive for weeks this way <i>Can we see God's ministry in this?</i> <i>Scientists at North Carolina <i>wanted to find out how the ants do this.</i> <i>They reproduced the circumstances <i>Time-lapse videos allowed them <i>To determine the precise structure <i>the scientists needed <i>They used liquid nitrogen.</i> <i>The analysis showed:</i> <i>What seemed like chaos was hiding <i>Some of the ants formed a tight weave</i> <i>by hooking their limbs <i>They were the base of the raft.</i> <i>Others moved around on it freely,</i> <i>protecting the colony's larvae <i>Some believe the Creator himself <i>How else would the ants know <i>But this, too, has an explanation <i>Collective intelligence.</i> <i>This phenomenon can be observed <i>For example, to counter <i>sardines form gigantic swarms.</i> <i>They move as one single large body, <i>Flocks of birds perform highly <i>without any two birds colliding.</i> <i>The secret behind these formations <i>Ants communicate using touch and sound.</i> <i>But above all, <i>Glands in their backsides <i>Through these, <i>and read the others' messages <i>Like where to find the best food.</i> <i>No single animal <i>But by communicating with its peers,</i> <i>it receives the signals that <i>A decentralized system.</i> <i>The result is a superorganism.</i> <i>And just like that,</i> <i>science has decoded So, are we speaking about One who is only relevant where science hasn't yet Not necessarily. Because true miracles do exist... don't they? <i>Luxembourg, September 9, 1986.</i> <i>For Jean Walte and his wife Anne,</i> <i>this day would prove fateful.</i> <i>Jean and Anne were badly hurt.</i> <i>Jean in particular had to live with My wife was in the back, So, my wife practically flew JEAN WALTE, ACCIDENT VICTIM And I was squeezed My heel bone was fractured.

LEE CLARE These individual ones look inward, And what we have here or maybe even early Gods. <i>That would mean Gobekli Tepe <i>from the times of hunting and gathering.</i> <i>A reconstruction shows <i>without the help of technology <i>All this, just to gather together,</i> <i>perform rituals, and honor the ancestors.</i> <i>Proof of how important <i>can be found with the newest discoveries</i> <i>that Lee Clare and his team have made <i>Remains of fireplaces, mortars, <i>that people settled here.</i> <i>That makes Gobekli Tepe <i>considered the key turning point <i>The Neolithic revolution.</i> <i>About 13,000 years ago, <i>domesticating animals, <i>Oddly, the area around Goblekli Tepe <i>It's a sparse mountain region with <i>Deep holes in the surrounding area show</i> <i>how difficult it must have been <i>These are cisterns, <i>Early settlers drove these into the rock <i>And so, the village church was born.</i> <i>Lee Clare is convinced <i>but a part of something bigger.</i> It's fair to assume that there were which had a connection to Gobekli Tepe. It was part of a network TURKEY <i>Within about 200 kilometers of the site,</i> <i>archeologists have found several <i>that strongly resemble Gobekli Tepe.</i> <i>More circular stone structures <i>Two things seem to have developed <i>Sedentism and the establishment <i>connected by a shared belief <i>This belief may have motivated people <i>in order to dwell longer at these sites.</i> <i>So, faith as a foundation <i>Religion as community advantage.</i> <i>History seems to confirm this.</i> <i>Faith is a central part <i>A love of God drives people <i>to go to dizzying heights.</i> <i>Many of the world's biggest <i>were erected to honor the Gods.</i> <i>Spirituality generates community,</i> <i>stability, and continuity.</i> <i>Faith touches every aspect of life.</i> <i>Holidays, art, education,</i> <i>and conflicts, too, are defined by it.</i> <i>But most of all, <i>a moral guideline <i>In our cultural region,</i> <i>faith in a benevolent God <i>A God of love.</i> <i>Isn't that incredible?</i> If you think about it, considering the past and present If God exists, how can he allow This is a big problem that makes <i>We've all known doubt.</i> <i>When we get sick.</i> <i>When we're afraid.</i> <i>Or when we lose someone.</i> <i>Again and again, <i>spreading catastrophe and misfortune <i>How could a loving God God and the evil and suffering are a huge stumbling block for faith. But there is a rational explanation. Because if God created humans nature simply has to have laws, so we can predict So, God allowed suffering so humanity can make decisions Following that logic, suffering is the price we must pay in order to feel secure I know it's not easy to understand. Many people felt that way, The first to do it <i>In France in the 12th Century,</i> <i>the man who later became <i>was living <i>This is where Anselm <i>that aimed to bring <i>Anselm believed <i>and so we should be able <i>Human reason <i>He defined God as &quot;a being than which <i>No person can imagine <i>Otherwise God would not be absolute.</i> <i>Anselm's argument goes even further.</i> <i>For him, this absolute being <i>because a real God is greater <i>That is where Anselm found his proof.</i> <i>If God is the being than which <i>and none more absolute <i>then he has to exist.</i> Well? Are you convinced? Anselm's argument is one of the most Many philosophers followed his example. Thomas Aquinas, Rene Descartes... Immanuel Kant, however, &quot;Existence is not a predicate of objects,&quot; There's a difference and ten real coins. Just because I can imagine something, Before Kant, another philosopher tried opting for a very different approach. His name was Blaise Pascal. <i>One of the most important mathematicians <i>Pascal wrote a still-prevailing treatise <i>and invented To him, which he compared to a bet. He came to a surprising conclusion. One could compare Pascal's wager In this game, and black for God not existing. If I bet everything on red, and then he really does exist, I go to heaven and not hell. Wonderful. If black wins, however... I believe in God, but he doesn't exist, I lose nothing, It's a pretty clever calculation So, he concluded that it was smart <i>That's not really proof, though.</i> <i>But in 2013, it supposedly materialized:</i> <i>real proof of the existence of God.</i> <i>&quot;Mathematicians confirm proof of God.&quot;</i> <i>&quot;Is God Real?</i> <i>Scientists 'Prove' His Existence <i>&quot;Computer Scientists Prove God Exists.&quot;</i> <i>This definite proof was supposedly <i>Computer scientist Christoph Benzmuller <i>He stumbled across an old proof of God <i>It was written in the language It's polarizing, it invites dissent, It's particularly exciting, A being is Godly <i>This proof of God came from the mind <i>one of the most important logicians <i>He was born in Austria in 1906 <i>but had a keen interest <i>The &quot;science <i>was shaken up quite a bit <i>Instead of using words,</i> <i>logical arguments began to be expressed <i>Kurt Godel was considered a genius <i>In 1940, he was invited to <i>where he befriended Albert Einstein.</i> <i>Einstein believed in a Creator.</i> <i>Maybe this was what motivated Godel</i> <i>to test God's existence <i>All the previous attempts at proof <i>whether God's existence TRUE <i>But that wasn't enough for Godel.</i> <i>He utilized a logic in which God could NECESSARY <i>This framework enables <i>In this sense, <i>is not only true, but also <i>The argument &quot;humans are green&quot; <i>It is not, however, necessary.</i> <i>How does this prove <i>The details are complicated,</i> <i>but at the end of the process, <i>The argument &quot;God exists&quot; <i>but also necessary <i>About 30 years later,</i> <i>Christoph Benzmuller <i>It was so complex that nobody <i>if there were any mistakes in it.</i> <i>However, with the help of a computer, <i>But in order for the computer <i>Benzmuller had to pick them apart.</i> This says: &quot;God exists,&quot; formulated in the language of logic. <i>Benzmuller spent months <i>that could check <i>The moment of truth.</i> <i>The computer needed <i>Godel's argument <i>But does this really mean For me, it doesn't prove It only proves non-contradictory PROF. CHRISTOPH BENZMULLER <i>Even though Godel's logic is coherent,</i> <i>it cannot prove God's existence.</i> <i>Because Godel, too, <i>that have not been proven themselves.</i> <i>Natural sciences <i>as they are based on the laws of nature.</i> <i>But God does not adhere to these laws.</i> <i>God is, by definition, not of this world.</i> <i>Which is why faith and science <i>They can exist side by side.</i> <i>The greatest scientists, <i>were open about their faith,</i> <i>even though God's existence It seems even the most rational of tools But modern theology uses modern science to further the understanding But the million-dollar question, is a question of individual choice.
