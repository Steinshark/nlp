This weaponry gives animals Finely-tuned over only the strongest in the battle for survival. [dramatic music continues] More animal warriors compete in the than anywhere else on the planet. But it's a home and elaborate escape routes. This complex hunting arena demands in the world's great animal arms race. [bird screeching] [insects trilling] [sinister music playing] Deep in the jungle, [crocodile grunts] Weighing in at half a tonne and armed with the female saltwater crocodile In Borneo, South-East Asia... However her prey Protected by many [screeches] They can quickly melt A confusing maze of vegetation. In a flat out chase across crocodiles know they will lose. So they wait for their [birds chirping] [grunting] A small herd of bearded pigs Pigs are intelligent, and fast. [squeals] But the crocodile is patient. [grunts] She is an expert ambush hunter. Although the reptilian brain is small, crocodiles are capable of and coming up with a plan. When the time is right, Manoeuvering her considerable No easy feat for such As close as possible to the bank, By slowing her heart rate, the crocodile [suspenseful music playing] She won't attack unless the pig [pig squeals] Sixty sharp teeth and she pulls it under into a death roll, It's been the perfect ambush, showing off the crocodile's successful Planning a hidden attack from beneath but how does a hunter creep up [suspenseful music playing] In the depths of the Amazon potential hiding And on each tree sits a sentry. [various animals vocalizing] The rest of the forest works together [screeches] In this case, a jaguar. The largest cat in the Americas. Armed with the strongest bite a jaguar can kill prey And unlike most cats, As good swimmers and able to rip jaguars are the only felines A member of the turtle family, the terrapin carries Overlapping plates of keratin form If threatened, so the trick is to creep [dramatic music playing] [chatters] [chatters] Today has been a success. But only two percent of the jungle's Because most animals rarely [gentle piano music playing] Famous for their sloths spend most of And never do anything in a rush. In Central America's Costa Rica, this female and her pup are on the But sloths are picky eaters. So it takes time. [gentle piano music playing] [birds chirping] Moving at such a measured Sloths are surprisingly strong, Good for getting around, but also deployed [dramatic music playing] On the forest floor, Although one of the smaller cats, Her otter-like tail gives and her slender build makes Like most hunters, so the sloth freezes, Suspended only by their arms, a sloth can hold its position Long enough for even a sharp Algae growing in the sloth's A close shave. This time, [ethereal music playing] Back in the Amazon River... some predators have Giant otters communicate They are a small, made up of a lead female and Only by working together can they quickly capture their prey. Because these otters are fish-eaters, and in these streams, Webbed back feet make and thick whiskers guide them to Some targets have The troop begins driving The young ones hang back, Their ability to learn from one another is The fish school together, But this is exactly what They herd the fish towards a dense patch [dramatic music playing] When predators work together, they can [birds chirping] Further south of the equator, dense jungles give way to the open forests [parrots screech] Here, predators must rely on [suspenseful music playing] The venomous death adder... armed with some of the longest fangs of He can attack in faster than the blink of an eye. [dramatic music playing] It's rare to ever see one on the move, Instead he has a secret weapon His taper-thin tail acts as a lure, The weapon is so deceptive, even death adders in less forested It's been a long time between meals, A skink, on its own In one second, a skink can cover Good for catching flying This adder is no match for its speed so All it takes is the smallest twitch. To a skink, [suspenseful music playing] The skink is in striking range and Even this close, The adder pumps the skink's First the lizard is paralysed, The adder's tempting tail [ethereal music playing] For those seeking to avoid capture... Australia's open forests So some animals have evolved Like the heavily armoured echidna. They belong to an ancient order egg laying mammals. And have existed here unchanged A testament to the effectiveness [bright music playing] They also have their A sensitive beak picks emitted by the Once their target is in range, fifteen centimetres in length To get his fill, this male has to eat [birds chirping] Sometimes his meal fights back. A nest of meat ants. With their troops numbering meat ants devour Dead or alive. They are also highly territorial, and will The echidna's spines are no defense but his swift tongue can inflict [up-tempo music playing] So he's planning a shock and As soon as he enters the nest, A forward line of guards The ants might be small, but they can inflict painful bites The echidna is repulsed. Ridding himself of the Even animals as well armed as the echidna In many forests, those with even less under the cover of darkness. [ethereal music playing] They seek safety in the night... [owl hoots] But they are mistaken. [ethereal music playing] The barn owl is the Its large eyes are extremely But his real weapon is a sense that can The owl's heart-shaped face like a satellite dish used It is put to the test tracking the careful The common house mouse. Widespread on every the mouse is one of the most It stays beneath the grass, with access to a maze of escape Huge, round ears pick out Yet even the most vigilant The owl has detected its target, One sound from its wings, and the mouse will be down one So the owl has evolved into one of the [suspenseful music playing] Most bird wings have a hard edges The barn owl's wings however softening the passage of the air.

One of the Her first weapon is an Able to leap 50 times escape seems impossible But she isn't one for the chase. She prefers food Portia is a spider-hunting specialist. Double her size and with the St. Andrew's cross spider Other hunters have tried and failed. [dramatic music playing] Preparing for this So portia deploys Camouflage. She waves her bristly To her short-sighted prey she probably And so unseen she can For portia has a She is a mastermind. Although her brain is no larger than And formulate a plan of attack. [dramatic music playing] She starts with a deception. Plucking strands of the she tries lure the But he's not falling for the trick. Onto Plan B. It's time for a [dramatic music playing] Insects are armed with weapons -[birds chirping] A grasshopper has enormously long legs, If it were the size of a human it could [bright music playing] Which is why this chameleon Using eyes that can see in 360 degrees, Without even moving. There's no need to get any closer. Her tongue lashes out at two and That's seven times faster It's one of the quickest weapon Combined with deadly accuracy, To compete against predators many forest insects have evolved The iridescent hue of the precisely matches the leaves of the screw The tree provides for all her needs, But enemies abound A jungle huntsman. One of the fastest The stick insect can't fly, But she is armed and Two small glands on her neck She has her own inbuilt water cannon, [suspenseful music playing] Her timing is crucial. If she shoots too early, she will miss So she braces until A burst of spray that can reach half But only momentarily. [dramatic music playing] It seems all is lost Yet the huntsman Peppermint is revolting to spiders, The sweet-smelling stick insect -[insects trilling] Tiny weapons can But the proboscis monkey of Borneo prefers He sports one of the most bizarre animal A weapon of seduction. While to the untrained eye, to female proboscis monkeys this [bright music playing] His oversized nose, signals that he's a large, with a higher sperm count than other Which is why he's in charge of a large harem He keeps the troop together [groans] Here, his nose helps again, producing an enchanting baritone, [groans] [bright music playing] But the calls have also A gang of bachelor males [monkeys screeching] Such incursions cannot be tolerated. The crack of broken branches but one of the [screeching] So the dominant male Armed with over 20 kilos He's a formidable enemy. [dramatic music playing] [screeches] The gang departs, [grunts] He wins this round, by a nose. [ethereal music playing] Males hoping to attract Their elaborate displays can also leaving them in the firing line. Surprisingly one of the is put on by the tiniest of males. The itsy-bitsy peacock Measuring just five millimetres long, But this spider's got style. With a brilliantly coloured this showstopper He's already caught But he won't pass He must master one of the gaudiest [Latin music playing] He moves into position... [Latin music continues] The spotlight becomes his because on this stage If he impresses the female, But if he fails, It's not just a visual display, the male is also sending good vibrations in the hope she will The male approaches and just like a gymnast With bated breath This time, it's a ten out of ten. Not only has the male saved his neck, which he does by gently scooping Although female peacock spiders are Once a she has mated, this female is From the dance floor... to the gladiator's arena. Home to miniature warriors, prepared to battle to the death [dramatic music playing] With giants horns longer than rhinoceros beetles are armed with some of Far from the subtle art of seduction, shoving and throwing rivals in an This contender is on the way to a But first he'll have Another huge male thinks [hissing] He won't tolerate a rival. -[hissing] Each tries to topple the other, using their two-pronged [hissing] -[hissing] As the brawl continues, on a nearby log, A different species of rhino beetle, they are armed with two strong tusks, Each variety of beetle has The key here is to use the tusks to It's a throw down.

[dramatic music playing] [birds chirping] [tweets] The arms race between males produces the In comparison, females are often [tweets] However there are some species where [suspenseful music playing] In the northern rainforests of Australia, Almost two metres tall, more aggressive She's the queen with a defined territory and several She's been courting and today has laid a clutch of eggs. Now it's the male who takes charge. The queen heads back into while the male is left to incubate the Yet this father is inexperienced, and he soon abandons leaving the eggs dangerously exposed. [tense music playing] For on the outskirts a rival females lurks, With no territory of her own, Unless she can find a way to Destroying the monarch's Yet, eliminating the competition is the only way for this female The male returns... but he is too small to take So the rival gets to it, undisturbed. The dirty work done, she will now An illicit liaison carried out [suspenseful music playing] The battle of the and the stakes couldn't be higher.

Her weapon is extreme speed. With a slight build, flexible spine, her top speed is The fastest hunter on land. Yet out in the open even [bird screeches] Her home is the vast plains Here, prey is plentiful but they And are either equipped Predators cannot rely They also need a game plan. [ethereal music continues playing] First, the cheetah uses the tall, Her target is a nearby Her favourite prey. Yet the gazelle are in an open patch. Armed with acute hearing and sharp noses, If spooked, they can take off at Slower than a cheetah, The hunter can maintain her So she must inch closer. Fifty metres out from the gazelle, [dramatic music playing] Not even close. More weapons are deployed for than for any other event but one side always has to lose. And surprisingly, Soon the cheetah will be desperate... because she has a new Her cubs are only three weeks old, It will take two years to fully train A huge investment that will Many predators put extraordinary into preparing their The animals they prey on, however, must be ready to run for their [ethereal music playing] Within an hour of birth, The urge to keep up for on the African plains there It's a defensive strategy, which drives some of the largest A herd creates confusion and minimises the risk of any Even elephants, the largest land Especially to protect their young. Zebra foals are raised fiercely protected Armed with bone-crushing kicks... and a ferocious bite... stallions will not hesitate to attack These pre-emptive strikes are However, hyenas are not the most [ethereal music playing] A lioness, the undisputed queen Weighing in at 180 kilos she's not she has one weapon that [sinister music playing] She hunts in a group. Lions are the only big cats As a unit, they saunter across the plains [zebras barking] The zebra pull together. A shield wall of hooves and [dramatic music playing] But they must hold their nerve. This is why lions hunt as a team... With the herd spooked, One will lead the final charge while the [dramatic music intensifies] -[lion roars] [growls softly] Lions succeed due to a combination The whole pride comes They can gorge on up to a quarter their so they share food grudgingly. [ethereal music playing] Far from the bounties is the world's driest continent Australia. Its vast arid interior, covers a land mass larger than There is little food Only one mammal is able to survive the dingo. They often hunt in packs, but this juvenile male has been and must now search Using a highly he can trail targets from Prey is so sparse the dingo has been Today his nose has led a small herd of feral pigs. [pigs grunting] The adults are large They could easily rip open a dingo. Especially an inexperienced one. There a few piglets, He needs to separate them. -[dramatic music playing] He flushes the pigs out into the open. On the run, the herd might The adults guard their young... but dingoes are armed They can keep up a high speed Few predators have such endurance. One female and her piglet finally and the dingo is in hot pursuit. He's not strong enough to so instead he must snap A near miss. [dramatic music continues playing] [piglet squeals] [piglet squeals] A tiring, well-won victory. Stamina is a powerful and is wielded effectively by the [ethereal music playing] On such arid lands, Drinking holes are like giant flocks of budgerigars [screeching] Recent rains have boosted the population, forcing tens of thousands of individuals to [dramatic music playing] It's the only water As the budgies descend, Armed with a powerful hooked beak, they can sever the neck bones The budgerigars can see the danger, The falcons move in, but the budgerigars [screeching] Like a shoal of fish the entire group suddenly The super flock presents A confusing blur of bright Together the budgerigars are a daunting, [dramatic music continues] The falcons change tactics An attempt to generate panic. It's psychological warfare, and frantic budgerigars collide in mid-air, The hunters swoop in on the fallout. Wave after wave of [dramatic music intensifies] While it seems like an unfair fight, thousands of budgerigars For them, sticking to the flock has The battle between prey and predator, is not the only threat animals For some the dangers A female wedge-tailed eagle returns Three days ago she but wedge-tailed eagles are born fighters, Chicks can devour half their So to cut the competition, the first to hatch is driven As the first-born and largest of the chicks, [chick chirps] For some the arms race [ethereal music playing] Further inland, temperatures can push And even in a good year, Such extreme conditions like these cone-shaped pits With their perfectly angled slopes, with an ambush predator at the centre. Ant lion larvae attack However their striking distance is short. Passing ants just have Armed with six long legs, if it were the size of human an ant But the slopes are treacherous, and the ant's feet begins [dramatic music playing] It's then the ant lion raining volleys of boulders [dramatic music continues] The ant is done for. Death craters are not the only With such little food on offer, Australia's aptly named thorny devil, looks as though he is truly [bright music playing] Although he feeds exclusively on ants. His short, sticky tongue can His impressive armour however deadly thirst. Too tiny to travel the thorny devil When the desert is covered in dew, his spikes collect the water and funnel For some, the arms race is more Although the devil's thorns A good precaution, as more venomous hunters are found [sinister music playing] The deadly eastern brown. He preys on small rodents. Yet from his fangs flows venom that So potent is his bite it seems a bit of But rodents are quick, and snakes have no limbs or They must kill with just one strike. [sinister music playing] He hunts actively, Today, however, A giant is on the prowl. A two-metre long, and one of the largest the perentie. [sinister music playing] Rodents are not enough He is a cold-blooded snake killer. His forked tongue picks up a chemical Unlike the snake, he can also raise himself up on all four Both weapons arm the perentie even when they go underground. It is not known whether perenties Perhaps they are just brave. [sinister music playing] It takes one brute to take out another. [ethereal music playing] With such monsters on the prowl, some have changed their entire Like the world's ancient mammals, who once went underground to they live under the cover of darkness. [owl hoots] The tiny, fat-tailed dunnart Although just nine centimetres long, this marsupial is, surprisingly, [owl hoots] Her game of choice is insects. But how does she track them down at night She has an astounding super power. One possessed by only ultraviolet vision. Most leaves reflect ultraviolet, So to a dunnart, the profile of a An easy victory for a [owl hoots] It is thought that dunnarts could belong for whom such abilities were common. A weapon she has retained in order to Some animals of the plains have but the freezing cold. On the prairies of North America, [wind howls] This coyote has spent the summer months Armed with keen vision, and a top running speed he is a formidable opponent. But soon the burrowing rodents he savours The coyote's entire range All that is left is a deafening silence. [wind howls] The vole makes snow and ice it's shield. Burrowing deep beneath the surface, the family stays warm and They smugly bunker down Above ground, the coyote is not deterred. [wind howls] With most of his weapons He must rely on his precision hearing. [dramatic music playing] Timing is everything. Launch too soon and the vole escapes. He must wait until his radar The coyote is armed to exploit [coyote howls] The change of the seasons always As snow begins to melt on the prairies, Soon the males will fight in one of the Sheer bulk is their weapon of choice. Each weighs over a tonne. Swung by a powerful neck, The enemy they face is not a predator, In skirmishes that will determine [grunting] [dramatic music playing] [ethereal music playing] However the fighting has its costs. By the end of the rut, and so hard that they've lost They emerge from the This juvenile male is so exhausted, so he's been left behind. As the largest animals on the bison usually command but one this weak draws attention. [sinister music playing] A gray wolf emerges from the woods. He sizes up his enemy. Even a frail, bison bull and could gore and kill a wolf. [wolf growls] The wolf however is A predator whose most useful weapon, is the ability to assess quickly If he has judged correctly, However if he has miscalculated, The bison is surprisingly agile. With most of its weight centred over The wolf's reaction speed is faster. Keeping him millimetres [dramatic music playing] The pair duel for over four hours. [bison grunts] Finally, the bison succumbs to exhaustion. The wolf has chosen his target well. [ethereal music playing] Despite the dangers it's an incredibly common And nowhere else is that more obvious While males are almost always ready Either pregnant or with young at foot. With not enough many males have developed to fight for the right to reproduce. [dramatic music playing] Horns are the most popular choice. They come in a variety of shapes... But relative to the size of all of these weapons are massive. Males haul them around all year when the in the rutting season, [dramatic music continues] Competition on the African some prefer to just get above it all. Standing at over five metres high, giraffes are the tallest And almost half their Most people assume this is so giraffes can to feed on tall trees However long necks can and are put to use by male This young bachelor To establish his position, If the bachelor wants a hope of mating, Pushing and shoving [pensive music playing] Then they begin With skulls as heavy as 13 kilos a well-targeted hit can shatter bone. Clashing their necks like swords, [dramatic music playing] The bachelor's rival begins to tire. He pauses... and without much fanfare moves away. The young bachelor is victorious. [ethereal music playing] Elsewhere, the ritual of male In Australia, female red kangaroos have spent Soon the joeys will and that means their mothers In the off-season, the males have spent their time Kangaroos are some of the most Over half their body These bodybuilding to impress the females However, it's not all just for show. When two evenly matched they assess each other's ability And powerful double-legged kicks. If neither is willing to back down, [dramatic music playing] The less dominant male Powered by his strong tail, he can unleash over ten kicks a Heads are flung back out The larger male seems but the aggressor keeps Not ready for another beating, Male competition produces the but many females are [gentle piano music playing] In the Australian outback, a superb fairy Their dashing father Fairy wrens mate for life... but the female is not willing to She has the smarts to [chirps] [chirps] In total she has three young lovers, These bachelors It's a successful covert operation With four males providing for her young, [tweets] In return she mates with her lovers, mixing up the genetic Her dedicated mate doesn't seem to mind, In fact fairy wrens are so promiscuous, the majority of chicks aren't The arrangement seems and ensures fairy wrens as a Not all relationships are so harmonious. It's a sad fact that lying, are successful strategies in the war Strategies employed even by some [gentle piano music playing] The mother cheetah She's taken down She searches for a hidden spot She is cautious... and for good reason. A pride of hungry lions is on the prowl. As the largest predators in Africa, lions don't need They are partial to daylight robbery. Usually the cheetah avoids hunting when On the open plains there But with cubs to provide for, and now she faces an ambush. [dramatic music playing] The thugs quickly take and dig in for a feast. In close combat, As the sun soars over the plains, [dramatic music playing] Fire is the most A grassland blaze can sweep across Devouring everything in its path. On the way back to her cubs, She'll have to wait it out. [dramatic music intensifies] [dramatic music ends] Hours later, the mother finally approaches She moves them every [melancholic music playing] She hears a sound... Something's not right. The lionesses are lying in wait. The cheetah tries to circle around... provoking a charge from one of the lions. She backs off, but not too far. She won't abandon her cubs. However her worst fears Her cubs are dead. Killed by the lions. The removal of future enemy soldiers is not uncommon. One out of every two cheetah The mother can do nothing but watch. The battle is lost for the cheetahs, [melancholic piano music continues] Usually those with the biggest Yet sometimes, somehow, Hours later, the female cheetah hears [cub mews] A tiny survivor scrapes through. [uplifting music playing] Only by keeping her wits about her, will the cheetah be able Even the fastest hunter over land Strategy is what will in the most exposed animal Today 70% of the Earth's Oceans were the world's and they are still the largest. The Oceans vast blue armed with the ability [dramatic music playing] But hunting becomes easier for [dolphins clicking] Dolphins are among the most their large brain is their -[energetic music playing] These bottlenose dolphins not only communicate they also use precise echolocation, to find their prey... schools of fish that may be When fish detect predators approaching, they either try to flee... Or form a tight defensive school, They hope predators will be confused by Each fish tries to stay as rapidly changing direction as if But there is none. Against the intelligence of the attacking -[dramatic music playing] The dolphins break up the bait ball. [dolphins clicking] It reforms... [dramatic music intensifies] Individual fish picked off. The defensive strategy of the baitball is In the oceanic arms race, individual predators while prey have the numbers. The open ocean is the and conserving energy is a tactic as finding the next meal. [ethereal music playing] Weighing over two thousand whale sharks are the She feeds only on one of the plankton. In most of the oceans, But at seasonal hot spots like this one at it's abundant. In some areas, it can be seen from space. [uplifting music playing] The whale shark must swim across the Her secret weapon is knowledge. She knows the ocean currents, And she'll ride these currents, Exactly how she knows just when and [gentle music playing] But once she arrives, she gorges. Opening her metre-wide mouth as she takes in tens of millions She must eat an average Even though billions upon billions their strategy of vast numbers has seen them survive [ethereal music playing] The numbers game is played by [dramatic music playing] Once a year, spider crabs on the Australian They are here to upgrade For extra protection, they march towards But in these shallow inshore waters, there are enemies everywhere. A smooth stingray is on the hunt... and spider crab is on the menu. [dramatic music playing] For almost the entire year, like a suit of armour, to protect them. But as they grow their and the crabs must change into a new one It can take up to an and at least a week before Their defences are down. The patrolling stingray [dramatic music playing] The eyes on the top of so for the final strike the stingrays The naked crabs pile a few are sacrificed [dramatic music continues] [seals bark] Off the southern coast of Australia, a female sea lion hunts She needs to kill at least She hunts alone... but she's equipped with that detect the slightest movements [dramatic music playing] When a fish can make she can react in less But this skilled hunter is also hunted. The sea lion has a thick layer of fat It also makes her an enticing target for [dramatic music playing] Her nemesis is the great white shark. Four hundred million years of evolution A great white can grow up to six metres, They are immensely powerful. On attack, they push through the water and with jaws containing five rows of their destructive force is awesome. But sea lions are observant, So the shark must outsmart them, Camouflage helps the shark reduce Then, to close for the kill, the shark Great white sharks are the known to use the sun when they hunt. Like fighter pilots, they press home so their prey is blinded by the glare. By the time the sea lion realises it's too late. Immense power coupled with The open ocean may be a vast desert, but like all deserts there are oases. [ethereal music playing] Coral reefs occupy less than yet support a quarter Rivalling even the Amazon These salt water sanctuaries And it's here that marine animal arms On Australia's Great Barrier Reef, it hides in plain sight. Its prey are alert and ready to take so the lion fish's tactic is to be The prey are lulled into [ethereal music playing] The stripes and long, It's a form of disruptive camouflage, that disorientates smaller fish until they can no longer judge Beautiful, and deadly. The stone fish hides from its It looks exactly like a lump The perfect disguise for But the stone fish is not its defences are among the [eerie music playing] Protected by 13 toxin laden spines, Even when they see the stone fish, Once its ambush has been set, [eerie music continues] The attack is over in the blink of an eye.

[dramatic music playing] The octopus didn't see that coming. But she has a trick up her [magical music playing] Octopus have a superpower in their She's a shapeshifter. She has light-sensitive They send messages straight that determine colour and even texture. [mystical music playing] Her camouflage reacts almost She changes her appearance before she It's one of the most effective And octopuses need it. They are at the top of the and require their full range They deploy mimicry... camouflage... stealth. With no bones, and can beat a strategic retreat Octopus are the masters of deception. Defeated by her last prospective meal, This time she decides that The crab's external armour that protects them from most predators. But the octopus isn't Victory!

Here is where he spends most of his time, guarding his shelter diligently. But if another fringehead dares a turf war breaks out.
