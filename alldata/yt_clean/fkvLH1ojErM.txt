let's solve another problem in subnetting let's dive into the question directly the question is in a block of addresses we know the ip address of one host is 25.34.12.56 and the subnet mask is represented in a slash notation which is slash 16 in this case what is the first address that is the network address in this block so we are given with an ip address and the subnet mask and we are required to find out what is the first address in this subnet so we have many ways to solve this question let me take the well-known method and then i will also give you another way to solve this problem let's take the well-known method from the question it is clear that the ip address mentioned in the question is a class a ip address but applied with class b subnet mask so the class b subnet mask is 255.255 when we convert that into binary we will be getting all once in the first doctor all once in the second octet and zeros in the next two octaves now in order to find the subnet generator we need to travel from right to left and the first one we are encountering is here right so here is the first one we are encountering and what is the decimal place of that the decimal place of that is 1 only please note it's not other numbers it's 1 right it's 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 right and in which octet the subnet generator is the subnet generator is not in the first octet but it is in the second octet so the subnet generator is 1 and the octet position is 2. now let's take the ip address which is given in the question because we need that ip address in order to generate the subnet ranges we know the ip address that is given in the question is 25 or 34.12.56 25 or 34.0.0 is the first address of the first subnet why because this is a class b subnet mask the first two octets must be fixed right so the first two octets are fixed and we are starting from 0.0 and what about the next subnet we need to add the subnet generator in the octet position too right and in which octet position we need to add we need to add it in the second octet right because the subnet generator is in the second octet position so just add one to this place because the subnet generator is one just add one to the second octet will be getting 35. so the next subnet starts with 25.35.0.0 to get the next subnet just add one to the second subnet will be getting 25 or 36.0.0 and add one to the second octet of the third subnet will be getting the fourth subnet right which is 25 or 37.0.0 and so on and what about the last ip address since the second subnet's first ip address is 25.35.0.0 then the previous address is 25.34.255.255. please note here it's 25.34.255.255. if you are not clear what is the next address to this just make everything in binary add one to this to the last position you will be obviously getting this as the result and obviously the second subnet will be ending with 25.35.255.255. why because the next subnet starts with 25 or 36 then the previous subnet should end with 25.35.255.255 and this continues and i hope now we know where is the ip address that is mentioned in the question false the ip address mentioned in the question is falling in the first subnet right in the first subnet we know the first address is the network address and the last address is the broadcast address and we solve this problem the network address for the given question is 25 or 34.0.0 so we did a reverse engineering approach in order to get the network address we have another way to solve this problem let's see what is that way to solve this problem in order to solve this we need to take the ip address given in the question the ip address which is given in the question is 25 or 34.12.56 right convert this into binary so when we convert this 25 we'll be getting 8 bits right so 0 0 zero one one zero zero one in the first doctor for thirty four it is zero zero one triple zero one zero twelve it is double zero double zero double one double zero and for fifty six it is double zero triple one triple zero you can manually do this and place it here so step number one is we are taking the ip address mentioned in the question and we are converting that into binary and step number two is what is the subnet mask that is mentioned in the question slash 16 right slash 16 means 16 consecutive ones so we are placing 16 consecutive ones and 16 consecutive zeros so this is a class b subnet mask its equivalent in decimal is 255.255.0.0 so we have taken the ip address and converted that into binary and we have taken the subnet mask mentioned in the question and we also have converted that into binary then we are going to do a very simple operation in order to get the network address the operation is the bitwise and operation so i had performed the binary and operation on these two inputs zero one is zero zero one is zero one one is one both inputs are high right so one one is one if any one of the inputs is 0 obviously it is 0 and wherever we have 1 in both the classes then only will be getting high input that is 1. so we got the binary result of the and operation we had performed let's now convert that into its equivalent decimal 1 2 4 8 16. we have ones against 16 8 and 1 so 16 plus 8 plus 1 is 25 right so we are getting 25 for this octet and here we are getting 34 here we are getting zero and here we are getting zero and what is this and this is the network address very simple you know just take the ip address convert that into binary take the subnet mask convert that into binary then perform the bitwise and operation and whatever you get just convert that into decimal we will be getting the network address so i hope now you know how to find the network address of the given network so you can take any of the ways which i had taught you you can go with the reverse engineering method or you can go with the and operation method and that's it guys before we sign off let's see the homework question in a block of addresses we know the ip address of one host is 182.44.82.16.26 and what is the first address that is the network address in this block i recommend you to go with the and operation method because it will be the simplest method to solve this problem easily i will give you a clue to do this the subnet mask is mentioned in the slash notation how many ones we need to make we need to make 26 ones right so let me go to the previous slide so in the previous slide we used only 16 ones but in this example it is requiring 26 one so eight ones here eight ones here make all these eight bits as one and we will be getting 24 ones 25 26 please watch it carefully up to this place up to this bit we need to make it as a one right and then we'll be obviously having six zeros in the last try this problem and post your answer in the comment section i hope you guys enjoyed this lecture and thank you for watching [Applause] [Music] you
