Yippee-ki-yay, movie lovers, I'm Jan and in scenes that completely changed the end of including a heart-breaking message from Anna Kristoff that we never got to see. Frozen 2 took some dark turns; however, the darker with the destruction of Arendelle Castle At the end of Frozen 2, Anna makes a momentous &quot;We have to break the dam.&quot; &quot;But Arendelle will be flooded.&quot; She provokes the Earth Giants into destroying about to engulf Arendelle until a reanimated to stop it. However, a deleted scene on the Blu-ray now Elsa wasn't there to stop the tsunami which flooded much of the kingdom. The deleted scene takes place as Anna, Elsa of the devastation caused by the flood. &quot;We'll rebuild the castle. New, no secrets, no deceit, new rules even!&quot; This original ending would have been a little betrayal of the Northuldra would have had The Art of Frozen 2 book also gives more details ending, explaining that the castle would have and Arendellian styles.&quot; In this alternate ending, Anna also says she'll create brand new rules. That last point is likely a reference back Elsa discover a hidden room in the castle, belonging to their mother. &quot;These next pages are in English, but also.. Northuldrian.&quot; &quot;Northuldrian? But that language is forbidden. Why would mother know it? Or dare use it?&quot; It sounds like the repression of Northuldra than we saw in the film, and now as she's it's clear that in this alternate ending Queen &quot;Our lands and people, now connected by love.&quot; There's another part to this original ending back a memory of her parents, revealing just &quot;I wanna show you something.&quot; &quot;Wow.&quot; &quot;Darling, I've been thinking.&quot; &quot;Oh!&quot; &quot;It might be time to tell Anna about Elsa. I can't bear keeping her shut out any more. She's maturing now, she can be responsible.&quot; &quot;It's not Anna I'm worried about. What if we let them get close again and the Joy brings her powers out as strongly as fear.&quot; &quot;But if anyone can find a way to help her, &quot;You may be right about that. There's not much that girl can't do.&quot; &quot;Oh, her love could hold up the world. OK, we'll tell her when we return.&quot; &quot;Oh! Thank you so much for that.&quot; &quot;They believed in you Anna. And so do I.&quot; This scene was meant to address the idea that decision not to tell her about Elsa's powers. And it could have been a beautiful moment her up even better to become Queen of Arendelle. On top of that, when Elsa tells Anna: the cut scene would have mirrored perfectly &quot;I believe in you, Elsa. More than anyone or anything.&quot; The deleted scene may have also gone some the first movie about Agnarr and Iduna's parenting separated from each other. Another big change to the film's finale was Kristoff proposing to Anna. Indeed, Kristoff almost had a radically different his proposal to Anna happening early in the In earlier versions of the movie, Kristoff for Anna in the castle gardens which then &quot;So you're a lord now.&quot; &quot;Uh, yeah.&quot; &quot;And here we are.&quot; &quot;Is it hot out here?&quot; &quot;I don't know, erm.. &quot;Is it?&quot; &quot;Well I thought.. &quot;I mean, yeah, er.. I'm feeling very er.. cos it is romantic. And I guess I.. I, I wanted to ask you.. &quot;Ah huh.&quot; &quot;Yes! I mean er.. OK.&quot; &quot;Why is this so hard?&quot; &quot;This is hard? I'm sorry.. I.. I didn't mean..&quot; &quot;No, no, no!&quot; It's not you, it's me.&quot; &quot;Ahhh. Hey, what do you think the odds are he turns and tries to kill you like the last guy she There are lots of intriguing moments and details fact that Kristoff is now a lord; the question; Kristoff will turn out like Prince Hans. The scene is obviously a lot of fun and full and simple proposal in the final film: I've ever known. I love you with all I am. Will you marry me?&quot; &quot;Oh. Yes!&quot; But ultimately, the filmmakers have said that struggling with proposing to Anna and extend Kristoff's original arc through the rest of about how he was unhappy with his new position And I'll go into more details about that in Now, if Arendelle Castle was destroyed in that Elsa wasn't resurrected in time to save test screenings suggest, there's a version to life. In the actual movie, after Elsa unfreezes beneath Ahtohallan and, if you look closely, Concept art from The Art of Frozen 2 book Elsa from the water in a deleted scene that And there's a moment from the secret room support the theory that Disney were considering &quot;I can find no record of a human with power tragic fates.&quot; There's also something strange about the final In the scene, Anna unveils a statue in tribute to share the moment. And the earlier part of the scene feels like day given the very formal green gown, cape, &quot;Presenting Her Majesty, Queen Anna of Arendelle!&quot; And just how dressed up Kristoff, Olaf and Again, if this was originally Anna's coronation for Elsa to miss her sister's special moment, And even if the scene was always meant to it still feels slightly amiss for Elsa not Still, ultimately, it seems like Elsa remaining an unlikely decision for Disney given just At most, they might have contemplated reviving her resurrection in a third movie via an end-credits too much for an animated Disney film, given More probable is that, in the original ending, So, after the Nokk pulled an unconscious Elsa she was dead. This would have been followed by Arendelle then, in the aftermath, Elsa would finally This ending would have been more impactful and Elsa remaining dead for longer than she We've also got many other deleted scenes in of the story massively.
