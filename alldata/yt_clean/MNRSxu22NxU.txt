Me for example, But I let my hand It's like falling in love, At first sight, You can no longer It's exciting ! Art is a way Every good painting I've never heard Few people talk that way. So we keep it to ourselves. We turn arround It's true, It's like that for me too. I am also sad to contain In fact, I'm in a mess. I am broke. Even this dress belongs to my girlfriend. I can't pay my rent. - How much is it? I should never have told you. I ruined your day. I will get out of it, I couldn't! I never took the money from I won't ruin our friendship. I couldn't pay you back. I could maybe If you rent an apartment, I You see ? What is it ? You do not want I have to tell you... I cheated on you... I lied. I am married. Why did you hide it from me? I'm not the kind of girl You know when you spoke that we begin to love, you should have talked to me But I don't like it. - You married her. I couldn't bear my loneliness. You don't mind? I should... not yours Chris! - I accept your help. $500. I need $500, can i return $10 It is very good. You need a guarantor. A guarantor ? It's just a formality. - Thanks. You are so stingy! You don't even win Every night I have to go downstairs I save on everything, and you, What would you do without me! Poor dear husband... If only he had a grave You couldn't even I had to snatch you I would have done better to remain a widow. I support it - I am stuck ! You drank ? Let me smell your breath. What's wrong ? Why are you blaming me I hate having to come down You have money, With his insurance. You want one, not me! I never touched those vouchers, I keep them for my old age. If he was there He had a good salary You live in the same apartment, But it didn't smell of paint. This smell keeps me awake! All that stuff in the hallway! Take it all away from me I will, that's for sure. The things you paint. They are pretty bad Utrillo made postcards And now that you're copying Utri... You are getting crazier and crazier. I saw what you were painting... Girls, snakes. The next time, I have never seen a naked woman. I hope so. &quot;His happiness&quot; will begin, I'm coming ! Mr. Cross came home late. Go ahead, eat and then you'll do the dishes. What are you doing ? I was looking for the newspaper. You are blind ? Didn't you like the radio? It cut off in the middle of the show. Did you read that? That murder in Queens. A man kills his wife and get rid of the body I read the newspaper, thank you. He didn't succeed. He will have the chair We have no chance leave this diary You wouldn't throw away my paintings You will see. You won't have to. A friend of mine takes an apartment I'll take it all there. If he's dumb enough for that, It's very bright, You know He rented the apartment He couldn't live anywhere else. There was his workshop. Sometimes he drew his models when he was working Some would pay dearly for that. You are an artist, Where is the room? This way. - What's the rent? He left a few things. You can recover them Here is the bedroom. I don't like the wallpaper. Can we change it? Yes, if you take a one year lease. I will choose it myself. Don't ruin my bag. Hi. I thought I heard the ringing. I did not hear anything. Is that all you got? Believes you happy, You even bought a book! You're supposed to be an actress, right? Shakespeare! Anything ! That's all I have left! You know where you can find it. He did not sell his paintings And I got into debt I need $1000 You got it by sweetness, He's scared when I talk about money. You got everything you wanted. You pinned it, He can slam the door. Ask her what her would think It's blackmail. It's blackmail - It's him ? Damn it ! Are you deaf or what? I thought you were angry. A gesture of peace! I was sure you would be there I rang downstairs You are doing well Do not do it again. Do not tell me You can take out Johnny. You just have to ask. You had to blow That could be. The last time I saw Johnny, I'm still trying. I read in the cinema newspaper He pocketed a million. He had no experience He worked in a pharmacy. So he didn't look like you! Stop fighting. I don't fight! She ignores my quick-wittedness. An actor earns 5 to 10 thousand dollars And why ? To ride I can do it. Why don't you do it? I could ! I brought some things. I will report tomorrow. And the rest on Saturday. - You have people! - Johnny? Here is a friend of mine, - Delighted. And Johnny Prince. Nice to meet you, It seems to me It could be. I do not remember. I must be wrong. It could be. I am leaving. I come with you, my heart. Don't bother, Johnny. I want to accompany you, my darling. You could get run over Goodbye Mr. Cross, Thanks for the tape. What is it, Chris? I don't like her boyfriend. Johnny is fine. I say, But something in him... She is crazy about him. Do you want to see my paintings? Come sit down, Chris. You are happy ? For the first time in my life. Very happy ? I constantly think of you. I only want one thing, I know that I have no right Have you already... There must be men who... Only one, Chris.

It is expensive to live like this. I would not like You said you You do not have enough money ? Acting is so expensive. Talent doesn't count, you have to Pay your agent...

He emerges... Something. It's serious ? I think so... - Where did you buy them? I'll take care of it if you want. How much are they worth? I can't sell them It's difficult People don't invest anymore And more prospects! give me your name I'll come back later. Where did you get that? Nick gave it to me. And my ring? - Do you know the price of a diamond? Shut your mouth ! The old man is however, you... He says his paintings Did you have them assessed? What's wrong? They are worth $25 each. You are crazy ! If I wasn't gallant... Do not get mad. Don't tell me I'm crazy. I'm sure he's a charlatan. His money is not bogus. He may have borrowed Fly ? It's not his type He didn't get it with his paintings. But he knows art. If you had heard it at the museum, it - Which museum? There were webs Where are you going ?

She can't stand it when we talk about I brought them to you I knew they were good. I would never have believed - Your work is very strong. Go ahead, go to the workshop. You are crazy to do that! I thought they were cops. I can not do that ! You wanted to be an actress You dated this guy, imitate him. I'll send Janeway to talk to you. How long has she been painting? Since his childhood. - Did she go to art school? I think I was the only one Like a friend... - What's your name ? She's a little... embarrassed. You should talk to him. With pleasure. So, Mr. Dellarowe? I wish Miss March It depends We will have to discuss the price again, I know how to recognize the work But you surprised me, your work is original, How long Sometimes a day, sometimes a year.
