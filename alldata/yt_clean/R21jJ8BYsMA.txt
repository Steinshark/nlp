It's the night before Christmas, not a creature was stirring, not even the boyz. Is the mouse the most - I do - The ratatouille is just... - No one was cooking. I know his name is Rat. I know Charles over there Man, that's really a movie-first movie - movie-title-first movie. - Ratatouille! Guys! [JORDAN] What about... a mouse, in fact? How about, um, - mouse-a-roni? Hmm, no. - I had a great idea. Is there a meal? - Spaghetti. Mouse - Spaghetti Rat. Rat-a-sketti. - Something's tip of my tongue. Yeah, there's a little ratscallion. But he's like a thief. There's a really good Uh, but he... It is kind of weird how Ratatouille, Remy's main flaw Mm. But how's he supposed to eat? He's a rat. Rats shouldn't - they should elect - not to survive. He goes into the kitchen like, - I'm like, &quot;You should've bought that!&quot; Yeah, you should have taken part - in our society, the human one. - Yeah. - That's so funny. Lot of kinda libertarian themes - Uh, Incredibles, a movie I adore... - You could even say it's... very good. - That's actually way better. Ratatouille, of course! - Um, Incredibles - - The Incredibles. some people are born better than others, but it's OK. You just have to not You have to help people out, but also the big thing that Dash is using his powers to almost win a race, but take second out of... - charity? I don't know. Right. That's when the billionaire - donates a little bit of cash. - after killing a bunch of people. That's when Alfred Nobel - after inventing dynamite. Like, &quot;God, what's the - Yeah. &quot;Peace, actually.&quot; &quot;And maybe economics.&quot; Do you get a thing for the - I think so. - Yeah, it's like - You get one of those Iron Man heart things. - Oh, implanted? in your heart, and you live forever. - That's the Nobel Prize. - You get a big coin. What if you accidentally - Oh, NO! - &quot;I'll just use this.&quot; You drop it in and you go, &quot;Noooo.&quot; - And then... has won a Peace Prize because of me. And all I got was, like, a Snickers that almost came out. Oh, yeah, it goes, zzzt, zzzt - - Chk-chk-chk-chk! - &quot;Call support. Error, error.&quot; Nooo! I guess it's just water. I don't know. Yeah, water is reverse dynamite. Well, that works - if you get to the dynamite quickly. Yeah, if you get to the - He actually invented it. - They don't - - The villains don't know that weakness. Yeah, he's soluble John Wick. John Dry. - &quot;Ouch!&quot; Um, being... I love... I love not being smart. It's the best. Because not knowing things, - it means there's more magic in the world. Like, one of the questions where I know the answer When you light a candle, where does the candle go? Like, isn't that fun? - That is pretty whimsical. It helps, too, that it's like a little... like a little sparkler. Or it smells kinda magical. You're like, &quot;Oh, the magic smell - went into the air.&quot; and it disappears, question mark. - They should make one that keeps going. and evaporate into the Are you a candle bastard? Uh, I am, depending on... the season. This year, actually, - no pun intended - year. Yeah. It was not a candlelit year for me. But in the past, I have gone candles. There's this Black-owned business I wanna give a shoutout. But they have excellent candles. Um, and I would light them - and I would just sit down on the couch and do a smell. They're based in Harlem. - Hell yeah. Oh, and they're based in candles. Yeah. They're from a movie called The Incredibles. - Oh, no! That's a movie about how some - but you have to like all of them. and makes you steal cheese, or whatever. You reckon I'll get a critical about how I've misunderstood And it's actually about how - [JARVIS] Yeah. It'll be about - it's a movie about... - killing. because it's a movie I like,&quot; - will be the feedback. - That is often the critique. &quot;Stop being mean about the movie.&quot; - &quot;Brad Bird cares about me personally.&quot; - You'll get a message from Brad Bird. Ho, ho, ho. We're over here on Patreon.com/SadBoyz doing our non-denominational We've got some mulled wine Jordan is somewhere. He's swimming with the fishes. - Nope. Nope, he got a cramp. Oh, he got bit by a shark. Oh, shit. Things are going crazy over So after you finish this episode, - come and check it out. There's a submarine? We're gonna listen to some Also, our live show is still available, You can grab that for $3 or you can just get a $5 subscription. - You doing OK over there? OK. Cheers. You're gonna get a message from, um, Ray Raven. He's gonna be like, &quot;I'm not Brad Bird.&quot; It's like when Kevin Durant got caught using a burner Twitter. Oh, you should know. I'm now, like, planting little basketball stories It's like, &quot;I think Santa Claus is real,&quot; like Kevin Durant doesn't exist. But the whimsy of telling me stories about this crazy guy is fun for me. So, Kevin Durant is gonna be in the Hall of Fame. He's one of the best basketball He's also had a very long career, 'cause he's 35 now and he's playing for the Suns. And, uh, He is... has a reputation for being one of the more - And we're Sad Boyz. We're soft boys here. He has a reputation for being in terms of letting - and feeling the need to defend himself. Which I understand. I understand, because if you - Like, we just have a modicum where people know who And just that can be overwhelming. So if someone is of the fame level I can understand how this Not because of what you do, Right, and also basketball Like, you have a bad game and He hurt me personally!&quot; - &quot;Execution!&quot; is based on our team that's never won let alone a playoff game, ever in the history, but every time &quot;And I will not focus on You're a fake fan. You're a bandwagoner. And that is worse than So Kevin Durant lost when he left, um... So, Oklahoma City Thunder Well, he was drafted to the Seattle - I'm - Anastasia's proud. She's proud of me. He was drafted to the Seattle Supersonics, And then he went to go play for the Oklahoma City Thunder, - Played there - ? Anastasia's here. [ANASTASIA] The Supersonics - Right! Because Supersonics are no longer a team, by CEO of Starbucks, and he fumbled. So they became the Thunder. Um, and then the Thunder actually had a really good team of young superstars, essentially - Russell Westbrook, James Harden, They were great. Um, but anyway, James Harden leaves... Um, KD and Russell Westbrook, they're doing great. They end up losing, um... They end up blowing a 3-1 lead in the playoffs to the Golden State Warriors on sort of the beginning of their dynasty. Actually, they'd already won a championship Yeah, because KD came in So then, um, so then... After losing 3-1, um... Or they're losing at this point, and he said this thing on Twitter when he was still at OKC, right? 'Cause... 'Cause he mentions Russ in the Tweet. Right. So basically... The whole point was he lost Uh, the 73-win Warriors, considered one of the best Kevin Durant joined that - mega-super-duper team. And so not a lot of people Um, I could care less. Whatever. He's a good basketball player. But, uh, the, um - The funny thing that he did was, online, people were talking about, um... Was it they were talking Or they were talking about the - [ANASTASIA] I actually don't remember. critical of Kevin Durant, So he responded, thinking he was on a burner account, actually responding with his - Wait. Yeah, he responded - It wasn't they later linked it to him. - Yeah, he responded with his real account. It was like, &quot;KD can't win - OK, that's kinda cool. &quot;They just got,&quot; you know, Actually, can we pull up the tweet? If you just pull up, like, I would be so scared to say at any kinda level of notoriety. I feel like I would read [ANASTASIA] He's like championship tweeter, though. - [ANASTASIA] He's so good at Twitter. This guy says, &quot;Man, but give me one legitimate other than getting a championship.&quot; &quot;He didn't like the organization His roster wasn't that good; Why... not do that on your own account? Yeah, like why use a burner for that, even? Uh, because it would be seen as pretty... You'd be calling out - you'd be insulting - all of your former teammates. Who you're gonna see through games; you're gonna play on teams with them. - Thank god that didn't happen. [ANASTASIA] I think it even, like, tampering is illegal, uh, trade tampering. [ANASTASIA] I think it could Oh, is it like insider trading, where you're spreading in, like, some other way, it's... &quot;Imagine taking Russ off that team; KD can't win a championship It sounds like a professional wrestler, like, talking about himself [ANASTASIA] I think [ANASTASIA] Here's a tweet [ANASTASIA] &quot;I'm watching and I'm wondering, how do these people know Ain't nobody ever been there.&quot; - You know what? - You know what? Ain't nobody know what's going on - on the Suns. He was so curious about And thank you; I'll be here all week. He was thinking about joining the team, &quot;What's that from?&quot; Um, Anastasia is our resident Suns fan and is from Arizona. [JARVIS] Also, they're So that is a wise commitment you've made. They're good this season, despite KD keeps ending up on big-3 teams where he's playing with Now it's Devin Booker and Bradley Beal, I have consumed so much basketball. I know so many things now. [ANASTASIA] I actually am Jarvis and I used to watch playoff games - in San Francisco. 'cause we were in San Francisco for the beginning of the Warriors' dynasty. So we used to go to improv practice, and then we would go to watch - playoff games and stuff after practice. [ANASTASIA] Yeah. So then I moved to LA and started this basketball [ANASTASIA] 'Cause I used to just with the podcast I was [ANASTASIA] And now I feel like I just - OK, what happened with me was I watched the playoffs and then I got super into for all of the storylines - going into the off season. And so then, then I got to be invested with how certain things 'Cause it's like, &quot;Oh, now this the big trade was Damian Lillard It's like, &quot;Oh, now I'm really curious to see how this player,&quot; who was loyal to their team for 13 seasons and has had incredible numbers, one of the best shooters in the league. Steph Curry is like the only reason held even higher for his shooting. And, um, now he's on a team with arguably the best a guy, the Greek Freak, - a like 6'11&quot; giant - is he 6'11&quot; or is he 6'9&quot;? - [ANASTASIA] He's almost 7'. - Yeah, is he 6'11&quot; or is he short? He's like... He's also a sweetie-pie, and he's - But, um - - Yeah. Or I think it's actually but it's a P, and so some announcers - Like, I think Mike Breen or and then other people say &quot;kumpo.&quot; [ANASTASIA] Some people still - &quot;That is not how you say his name.&quot; Oh, I saw a very funny clip today about - This is relevant to pronouncing It was on Jeff Teague's podcast. [WELLS] I don't know if you've seen it, but there a video of you in when he's yelling at the team, - it's funny - I told y'all I wasn't paying no attention - So, by the way, this is like a... This is Jeff Teague. He is a retired NBA player, but he was like a He won a championship with the Bucks. But he was never a star-star. Um... Apparently he was on this 2015 that never turned into - I'm - Again, I'm in deep. But, uh, anyway, the... But everyone, like, he never was a star that was known anything about him. And then he's recently, on his podcast, become viral for all these funny stories - he tells about the league. Uh, yeah. Um... But anyway, so he's He's very humble and honest It's like there'll be a clip and he's like, &quot;Why did you do that?&quot; And he was like, &quot;Man, I'm We never beat that man in And so he's at the end of his career and they're talking hyping up the team in a and he's just sitting [HENDRICKS] Fuck it, Gannis. - That's the only wrong way to say it. Can I ask you guys a Oh... absolutely. You think there's any chance with the NBA? - With the NBA? I'm pretty tall. 6'3&quot;. Yeah. I mean, you're still below - [ANASTASIA] Yeah, wait, how tall are you? [ANASTASIA] You're tiny. For the NBA. - Yeah, but... So, you think that's the - [ANASTASIA] That's the only thing. never played basketball, - Correct. If you're tall enough, I mean, I'm at my physical peak. I turn 30 in about 4 months. That would be... You know, you're not that far LeBron didn't start playing LeBron actually started playing at 39. He's a rookie in the league, and he's doing incredible numbers. [ANASTASIA] There are some guys but like Gary Payton... [ANASTASIA] His dad is also named I read that Gary Payton has two sons, and they're [ANASTASIA] Yeah, so Gary Payton is actually, um - so, this is fun. [ANASTASIA] Gary Payton, he's known [ANASTASIA] And he has [ANASTASIA] One is Gary Payton, Jr., - and one is Gary Payton II. - Hell yeah. and he's currently injured, Junior is the second, no? - Mmhmm. Yes, it is. [ANASTASIA] They're from Unless it's Jr. the II. The squeakquel. Why was he called &quot;the Glove&quot;? [ANASTASIA] Because, uh - He wore a catcher's mitt. - That must have gotten in the way. - with a catcher's mitt. [ANASTASIA] People were - 'cause it's cute and little. [ANASTASIA] But he &quot;This sucks for me.&quot; - [ANASTASIA] &quot;I want a tough name.&quot; Yeah. There will be rookies who... Like, there's a rookie on... Oh, am I gonna know what team it is? Let's go with... Is it the Magic? It's like a 27-year-old rookie who is a multi-championship and he was just brought over. Is it with the Magic? Now I wanna know, and we gotta stop the basketball talk. I think maybe, 'cause now I'm I've watched a fair bit like, physically I can probably... NBA. - There's no fighting in it. would be &quot;the Spider.&quot; Oh, yeah! The tiny spi - [ANASTASIA] Longlegs Smallbody 6'3&quot; is like the most wrong size to be. Like, shorter and there's phenoms, right? I'm taller than Steph Curry. But he's incredible shooter. - [ANASTASIA] He's like 6'3&quot;. - Yeah. [ANASTASIA] So you'd be a Steph Curry-type. I think I could be a Steph - - I think you're right. Also was a professional basketball player. My dad could be one. I've never asked. - [ANASTASIA] That's true. I've never found out. I... There is literally as much chance I have no other guess. - Bald. Bald man. - [ANASTASIA] Basketball player. Sucks for me. And the youngest brother is like 6'6&quot;. - I don't think it's the Magic. No. The middle brother, 'cause it might be insulting, He's shorter than me. Jeff Goldblum. [ANASTASIA] Spud Webb was 5'8&quot;, I think? - Spud Webb? - And, um... Who was the other, uh, very small player? [ANASTASIA] Um, Nate Robinson. Nate Robinson's another one. There's another one who has a fun name. Goddamnit, I'm back at Google. Hold on. [ANASTASIA] Oh, um... [ANASTASIA] Uh, he played Yeah. - [ANASTASIA] Muggsy Bogues. - Excuse me? - Was he a '20s gangster? &quot;Hey, Muggsy Bogues. You gotta &quot;I've got rockets in my shoes, [ANASTASIA] That's how he got kicked It's funny to think that a white guy the most athletic person in the world. Like Babe Ruth was at one point And he had like a running speed Did you see - well, OK. So, there's a basketball player who is a... He was a EuroLeague phenom at like 16, 17. Came into the league But he already had a lot of similar to Victor Wembanyama, who, like, he didn't play in the top tier but he played professional basketball as a younger-than-18 person. Um, Luka is like kind of famous for moving very slowly, but being unstoppable on offense. People are like, &quot;Luka does one thing. He moves really slow, he does a step back, and that's it.&quot; But somehow, some way, [JORDAN] I have half [ANASTASIA] You are unstoppable. I would say I'm exceptionally stoppable. - I'm a Ron Stoppable of sorts. You got a naked mole rat. - I'm Kim Impossible. &quot;Naked mole ratatouille&quot; - Yeah. Oh, that could crush. - Naked mole ratatouille. I... would die within two games. - Mmhmm. I would be unnoticeable. I wouldn't get the ball; wouldn't I'd hug it and put it under my shirt. You'd be in highlights 'cause you wouldn't know what to do. [JORDAN] My glasses would break. I just learned the nomenclature Like the one, the two, all that shit. I just didn't ever [ANASTASIA] That's the [ANASTASIA] You know how they say [ANASTASIA] It's the moment - that you feel like you've crossed over? [ANASTASIA] I feel like Jarvis because he can say, like, &quot;Oh, yeah, he plays the four, but sometimes he plays the Then you wake up sweatily from that dream. Yeah. I was like... I was like, &quot;Yeah, but really has been phased out in the modern NBA, 'cause they're focused more on small ball ever since the Warriors' run.&quot; You've turned it into - You've multiclassed as a jock and a nerd. I know, dude. Actually, all - But, um... But anyway, uh, the people You can get very nerdy about sports. But let's change the subject, What about the NFL? Do you think Um, you could be like Ooh. Ooooooh? [JARVIS] Yeah, he doesn't Do you know who Travis Kelce is? You could say &quot;Taylor Swift.&quot; - Uh, she's got bad blood, I hear. I don't. - So - Uh, he plays tight end for the Chiefs. Um, Kansas City Chiefs. Um, and he's dating Taylor Swift. And now the... The NFL is having this weird thing where they're having this influx They put Taylor - they, like, tagged - The NFL Instagram account - tagged Taylor Swift - in their bio or something like that. Uh, or said like &quot;Taylor's #1&quot; - I can't remember what they said, because they're now getting all of these... Like, this influx of fans who but are now learning to support It's very cool, the power of Taylor Swift to get a bunch of people - they've never cared about. You make sure you have whoever and get a huge spike in popularity. - We should do that. Well, now there was recently... Taylor went to a Chiefs game and the opposing team, The opposing team booed her. - As if she was a part of the team. Did she...? She's just - at her sitting down? Yeah. I think we have it. - (crowd booing) Oh, just while she's on the big screen. - Yeah, on the jumbotron. (crowd booing) It's like he's getting tired. - (weakly) Booo. - (both sighing, booing, snoring) Taylor, how do you have when you're performing Wow, I suddenly respect I'm actually learning to Gosh, it sure is hard to be a hater. That's such a funny thing, 'cause into who one of the personally is dating. - You little weirdo. of this rejection of... Sports fans en masse on social media - so we're can be annoying as hell, one. - Two, they can be a little hypermasculine. One example of this is... This is so fucking funny. I actually wrote this in my notes. I didn't even think we were But, um... Every time you - It's sometimes so funny to see guys, bros' bros on Twitter, saying positive things about other men, - like the sports figures that they like. Because there's like the homophobia jumps out, where they'll be like, &quot;Oh, man, LeBron had a really good game last night. - Not to glaze him up, though.&quot; Like, &quot;Pause, dude. No homo, but like...&quot; - &quot;I hope he sees this, king.&quot; my guy Russell Westbrook, did you see that triple double that he got? Not to frickin'... Ooh, I mean, I wanna hop off his D, &quot;Not to ride him, but...&quot; Yeah. And then in the comments, literally it'll be like, um... &quot;Oh, well, this player's actually +25 when he's coming off &quot;OK, Jesus, dude, are you dating him?!&quot; &quot;Y'all are getting a little defending these players.&quot; I don't understand why But I think that that kinda culture is what comes out when someone's like, &quot;Taylor frickin' Swift, dude? You're making me care?&quot; It is funny how it's literally something I could not care about after I was about 17 years old. Being like, &quot;Ew, Miley Cyrus, dude? You listen to girl music?&quot; - It's the exact same mindset. I'm gonna get cooties &quot;Yucky! She's not for boys!&quot; It feels like the same energy of why it was funny to make fun of Justin Bieber - in 2013. - When he was a baby. &quot;Girls like this? Dude, frickin'... Not on my watch. I'm gonna kill him,&quot; or whatever. &quot;It's not that I'm bothered about It's actually me laughing All he can do is sing Oh, by the way, I just read &quot;Massive boo's&quot; - apostrophe S, by the way. It's not possessive boos, but that's... - Here. I'll turn off the grammar mode. &quot;Massive boos from Gillette as America is waking up.&quot; - To what? To Taylor Swift? They were asleep before? One of the most famous I would say part, at least What's funny is you could the sunrise and been like - &quot;America's waking up.&quot; Yeah, &quot;It's just a little but America's waking up. &quot;Massive boos at Gillette Oh, maybe - OK, I got it. They say &quot;massive boos&quot; because Taylor is Travis Kelce's boo - so she's extra-big. They don't understand - Yeah. I'd be like, &quot;Damn, that's Yeah. A massive boo. Absolute massive boo. But also, these were not - I will go ahead and say it. - We already identified that they were, uh, yeah, they were mid boos. - I think if the boos were impressive, then why is this guy contributing so much? Just, you're covering up Bad journalist. He's trying to... to frame your - He's, like, trying to frame He's like, &quot;Huge screams come on when Taylor Swift is on the thing,&quot; &quot;Also, the iPhone, like... the microphone's fucked up. - My phone was being weird.&quot; and then it's like - &quot;Hey! Whoa.&quot; He's like, &quot;Things aren't the same.&quot; Someone else is gonna - stop glazing up Tommy boy.&quot; - &quot;He's mine. Belongs to me.&quot; Uh, I don't really... I'm very scared to say things Other than how much I love I wanna have on QTCinderella, who's like a self-described Taylor Swift stan, and who knows a lot about Taylor Swift. She could maybe explain - I've only been a casual - to us while we were on Fear&amp;. - Oh, yeah. Yeah. Um, I - But yeah, I've been a casual listener. There's a few, you know, I think Lover's an I haven't listened... I think I've listened but it takes me back to a time. Is there, like, a single - On that one... - Uh, &quot;Cruel Summer.&quot; &quot;Lover.&quot; Um, &quot;Lover,&quot; featuring Shawn Mendes. - Um... He was a single on it? Was she single on it? Seriously, guys. - Where's my massive, boo, dude? Dude, I need a - honestly, I need a massive boo. Dude, it would be so funny &quot;not to, like, glaze them up - of any public figure about anything. Literally, they don't know you, I'm wondering if I took some screenshots, because I was... I sometimes feel like I'm losing my mind. &quot;That's not how you say Giannis's name. Not to glaze him up, or anything.&quot; &quot;Not to be a sexy pervert.&quot; Yeah. So Andrew Schulz is apparently beefing with Myron Gaines - by the way, hilarious fake name - from the, uh, Fresh &amp; Fit. - He's the main Fresh &amp; Fit guy. He's the main one. He's the cop. - The one who was a cop. - little Andy Richter who sits next to him. He's like, (high-pitched) Yeah, he does. - &quot;Oh, gosh.&quot; &quot;Yeah, give him the old one-two!&quot; &quot;Give it to all 12 of those I've dated! So they're beefing, and now people are trying to navigate this thing where but they live in the - red-pill alpha male zone. So they can't be too supportive of him. Like, people are calling and people are like, &quot;Mid comedian? I mean, not to glaze him up, but he did sell out And then people are like, &quot;Whoa, That's kinda wild - that you just said that.&quot; I mean, I guess they're both on... Yeah, he's on Rogan, and I love this guy, I like every single thing he says, but he's being rude.&quot; What's his beef? Oh, it was just on the pod - - You know how Fresh &amp; Fit got demonetized? They still post their podcasts or whatever. - And so... This drama's so messy. Because I feel like the people involved can be kind of drama-baity, so I don't wanna give But there's just a clip - who has his own thing. He's on Flagrant 2, and then apparently, uh, Akademiks is a fan of, um, Fresh &amp; Fit. And so he brings up Fresh &amp; Fit, and then Andrew Schulz is like, He's like, &quot;Yeah, I don't like how you guys And then Andrew didn't know He didn't know that they had And so then Myron Gaines, um, tweeted that Andrew Schulz was a snake. Dude, you can - I mean, famously insecure, so I can see something But you can just not Like, there's an amazing mini compilation of Andrew Schulz just destroying that little guy from Nelk Boys, 'cause he goes on their show. He says, &quot;I don't know who Nelk Boys are.&quot; - He's just like an adult, dude. He just goes on the road, does podcasts, and maybe plays 2K. He's not doing this base. You're a red-pill fan of his? The, um... And so then people are... So then Andrew said and then people... There are some people in the thread And in one of the replies - I was just reading this that I consume for myself. - You're a bad boy that lives for drama. This is my favorite comment, and, uh... So this is in response to the concept that Andrew Schulz is a mid comedian. &quot;Separate his work from him. He's an A-tier comedian right now, peaking, but what he did on the pod and I was not prepared for that. I literally thought he was gonna call him - No, like that's - - It's so - It's so transparently like and the way they view the world. &quot;He was soy?&quot; I have started saying - because it's very funny. It is funny to, like, re-embrace invalid alt-right talking points. 'Cause &quot;soy boy&quot; specifically... I feel like people kinda forget this, &quot;Soy, it's like fake milk, it's weak, But &quot;soy boy,&quot; the origin of it, is that there is a genuine, genuine conspiracy that the estrogen inherent in soy products was influencing men in the West to take on leftist ideology - because they were turning into women. Which, there's so many - doesn't make any sense. But the fact that it was like, not just a zinger, it became They're like, &quot;He's a soy boy. We can dismiss him. Not only He's infected with estrogen.&quot; Doesn't make any sense. Not the same kind of estrogen. [ANASTASIA] Is that - It is literally just cooties. Big trend moment. - Funny trend moment. Festive trend moment. - Yeah. This, it's a post from Taylor Lorenz, friend of the show. Well, friend of the boyz. More than welcome. They made a post - with how many examples? Wow. Of a trend that initially when I saw it, I'm just like, &quot;Oh, this is like just And now I realize what because they are holding Jarvis, you wanna describe it? (sighs) We're looking at - OK, so we're looking at Christmas cards. And I don't know why - Christmas is related to this. But it is a... It is a family photo, and a photographer who arrived that day, or maybe they arrived on a set that day to do a themed Christmas photoshoot, had them... I don't know whose fault it is, but the man has a sign that says, &quot;Finally, peace on earth!&quot; and his presumed wife and presumed daughter have their mouths taped and they're wrapped up with lights. I mean... It's deran - - It's truly, legitimately deranged. I hadn't even accounted for the fact Also, if you're a tartan plaid carpet and have the guy wearing - It's a small thing. Also, he's... He's not really wearing - No. - for it to feel Christmassy. I just don't understand any of it. - It feels staged. OK, let's go to the next one. So... it's another one. The same concept. I don't know if it's the same photographer. If it's the same one, - this person should be jailed. - Yeah. I know. And if this is a trend, And why in the - ? This is a very small detail, but there's just a box that says - &quot;PEPSI&quot; next to them. I'm just upset with the fact that the little boy is giving a thumbs-up. That's the more disturbing trend out of I mean, it's a real trope, and &quot;Wow, the women in my life, But this kid barely thinks it's a joke. He 100% believes it's true. 'Cause she also makes him And tells him to do stuff. And I'm like, this is... This is setting this boy down a path of... - of, uh, &quot;make me a sandwich&quot; jokes - that I think that he will... I hope that he does not partake in. - He's a blue-check in the making. it's like, let's not. Let's not I don't know. I feel I'm not saying that the kid - The kid will make his own decisions. But I think the parents putting him in a situation like this is irresponsible, I think. It's a weird pitch, too, because, you know, I'm sure - - It wasn't mom's idea. But they didn't actually how the fuck you present that Be like, &quot;No, 'cause you suck? - You're annoying, you know?&quot; Uh, never seasonal ones. But oftentimes, you'll show up... Sometimes it's at a photo studio; sometimes it's at a, um... a venue that has different sets set up for different backdrops, the things I've Sometimes they'll be in a classroom or in a metallic room or in an old car, But as far as I can remember, the photographer never offered us rope or a gag or any kinda - That's what I'm trying to - So you arrive there with your family, and they're like, &quot;All - I'll be taking your photos.&quot; &quot;I'm excited to put something and have these photos &quot;Yeah, so we've got a few sets. - We've got, um, the Christmas tree set.&quot; &quot;Yeah, and you can sit along &quot;Why are all the lights on the ground?&quot; &quot;Um, now we're just gonna &quot;OK. Well, we're shorter. &quot;And then -&quot; (imitating duct tape ripping) &quot;More context required, I feel like.&quot; &quot;Why are you doing that?!&quot; &quot;What are those hoods for?&quot; I wasn't sure how to make a tape sound. - Did that come out right? - [JACOB] That was pretty good. &quot;Taaaape?&quot; How about that? - Um, boiiiiiink! - Mime tape! Yeah. And... The kid's expression Yeah. It's a little bit of a forced smile, so maybe he knows Well, he doesn't wanna get taped. Let's go to the next one. - See... Why is that kid giving a thumb - Like, I feel like the photographer's like, &quot;Now let's have the little boy I don't wanna be mean. This kid sucks at doing a thumbs-up. Shitty angle. Doesn't make any sense. It's a thumbs to, like, 1:00 p.m. Here's a question: So, so... This is not a Christmas shoot. - Not in the slightest. They are at a tree farm. They've brought lights. They say, &quot;We're gonna skip a step.&quot; - No way of plugging them in. We're not gonna bring the tree home.&quot; It's in the daytime. &quot;We're gonna bring the lights to the farm.&quot; And yeah, this is so weird. If not for the fact a hostage, hands tied together - This one is the dad kneeling The kid failing at doing a thumbs-up. I don't mean to dwell on it, the mother and two daughters are, honestly, they're all doing bound-hand look, kind of lights flimsily If that string, the string lights I would believe that these are fake bits of tape. The fact that they're neon green kinda But if you block it with your thumb, this looks almost like a regular photo and someone was like, &quot;It'd be Yeah. I do think they do have tape on them. - Oh, definitely. No. It wouldn't give you peace on earth. They'd still be nagging. Why is &quot;peace on earth&quot; always I know. Well, they trade it out for different misogynist slogans. I just don't understand. I do like that this one - That's true. not &quot;FINALLY frickin'...&quot; I guess this one could be a coincidence, where it's just like, &quot;I wish - my family is kidnapped.&quot; what drove everyone to this place. It's not parallel thinking, right? Like somebody saw this, &quot;Oh, I need to offer the &quot;for my Christmas shoot.&quot; Look, I mean, yeah, again, none of this matters, but with that kinda bowl haircut, you should be doing your best to maintain - the position you are in with that look. OK, let's go to the next one. Well, you know what sucks, than that little boy's gonna become or even just internalize Is that those little girls are absolutely gonna &quot;Yeah, I know, we're kind of boys put up with us, and that's nice.&quot; &quot;So all I need to do is be good.&quot; - What the hell? Also, who let this man Is he a time-traveler? Does he [ANASTASIA] I was wondering why they're - Yeah. Go home. You're outdoors. So it doesn't hit, really. But I guess it being regular rope - would be a little much. They for sure, uh, did some shit in post to those lights. - They do not look natural. - 360deg glow. They literally just grabbed a, um, the brush tool in Photoshop, turned hardness to 0, and then dabbed a little color on it. I mean, the one that sticks out What is he wearing? It's not even Christmas. It's just red, but it's kind of red long johns that, like, a Red Dead Redemption character wears. - This is insane. because it looks like there's - She's doing a great performance. Is there something to the fact that so many of these have twin daughters? - [JARVIS] Yeah. are the most annoying people in the world. They're all like, &quot;Last Man Standing, huh?&quot; &quot;No, seriously, three nags in the house? Better go out and tailgate,&quot; or whatever. OK, wait. New thought. What if this is a stock photoshoot? - Like, this is a default...? But it's like, 'cause you know how there's stock photos of weird situations? Like, &quot;Man on the toilet [ANASTASIA] I do wonder if this is, like, something that became trendy... like a style of Christmas card because some blogger did it Oh, like Catturd posted about it, [ANASTASIA] Like, essentially the way - because a mommy-blogger posted about it, and then everyone's like, &quot;I wanna burn down a forest.&quot; Anyway, weird trend. Though this does remind me of... the Disney couple shirts. Yeah, I heard you mention this offhand. I don't - I may have seen this. Uh... - Are they cool? Should we get them? Look under your seat. Does it criticize me Always telling you, &quot;Hey, stop shitting - Guh. Nag. I'm already doing it. Nine dollars? That's actually pretty reasonable. Is it one of those ones shirt color modifier... - like, size large, and it's like $200. It's like, &quot;Oh, do you want this on So there's this trend of, like, couple shirts that I guess you would wear to a Disney World/Disneyland trip. And #spoiled, #broke. - Should I get me and Katie these? - women be shopping, I guess is the joke? Their student loans have kind of - Right. but there's no getting around the fact that it is very Millennial-coded. I feel like being a Disney adult is age range 25 through 35. Um, Jacob, could you go It was that they get more expensive - Baby onesie. There we go. 3-month to 6-month? Jesus. Imagine... Dude, actually? Hold on. Mega-flex. You just have a child. The first clothes you wrap them in - is a onesie that says &quot;#broke.&quot; Children, they're very expensive Dude, this child is broke as hell. Dude, this child is unemployed, lazy, doesn't say a word, very rude. - Sleepy. - Yeah. This child's a Doc. - What are the fucking dwarves? - I guess he has an MD. Maybe his name is, like, Poopy, - for understandable reasons. - Um, all right. This one is - This one is... OK, this one's too complicated. - How about you read the wife one? I'm going past you, and I'm like... I, like, look down to a It'd be like if yours said, but I'm seeing where I can &quot;I'm a little bit #broke right now, but I'm trying to get to #spoiled, - if you know what I'm saying.&quot; and is born a Taurus...&quot; That's a... There is a website where I can't remember - from that website, - and I can't remember what it was. it just automatically offers No. I bought a shirt that said, like, &quot;I'm a dad on the internet - having a good time,&quot; or something. &quot;Never dreamed I'd grow up but here I am, killing it.&quot; I love that they decided - for the word &quot;wife&quot; as well. And also, is that supposed to be a Minnie Mouse bow on the &quot;spoiled&quot;? - [JACOB] Yeah. &quot;I work to support A lot of the guy ones are oddly dour. - Yeah. - &quot;I work for this.&quot; The wife shirts are, &quot;My life The guy shirts is, &quot;I hate everything, and she's bleeding me dry &quot;I'm doing what I can. - everything from me.&quot; - This is nasty as hell. if you're a person like myself Um... Well, that's for gangsters. - Um, why... My question, is this Because it should not be. &quot;I wanted the D.&quot; Um, is this available in baby onesie size? - Yep. - Jesus. It's available in every iteration Delete it. I understand it's probably But maybe if you're gonna - do it with just adult sizes. Wait. Do you see under &quot;add your personalization,&quot; it has omitted that? - It's &quot;I&quot; - yeah. - &quot;I gave her the,&quot; etc. Um, can you change the Disney D to something like &quot;I wanted the chips&quot;? - &quot;I'm so hungry.&quot; I was trying to figure out something but even &quot;muffin&quot; is like, I'm sure - - He wanted my little muffin. OK. &quot;Very good quality. It is very nice.&quot; I love Etsy reviews, dude. &quot;It was a gift and it was perfect.&quot; &quot;Arrived quickly. Great quality.&quot; I'm bitter about Etsy, because I ordered a Guitar Hero controller five months ago and, uh... they ghosted me. Dox the seller. Address and store. They told me in October I was up next, and it's been two months. - Maybe it's huge. but I'm trying to keep in the dark side. &quot;Hey, sorry, my... I lost my entire family I'll be back at it soon.&quot; I'm trying to be #spoiled on the outside - while I'm #broke on the inside. Yeah, broken. &quot;#broken&quot; would be good. - Ooh. &quot;I went to Disneyland Um, do we have any other ones? How about one that's like, &quot;I love and another one that said, &quot;He gives me nightmares.&quot; [ANASTASIA] The last time I was wearing a shirt where the guy's shirt said, &quot;My favorite Disney villain is my wife.&quot; Oh, wow. - That's rough. [ANASTASIA] Uh, like, &quot;I'm a That guy needs some - Ayyy. (imitating duct tape ripping) There's a lot of the &quot;I gave her the D,&quot; Yeah, because if you have one shirt idea - If you've ever though of a pun, someone printed it on a shirt - like fucking hawks and copied it. a little dicey with copyright. - Yeah. Um, should we get the one... - There was one, um - - &quot;I'm done adulting&quot;? Oh, fuck off. That one hits the bingo square. &quot;I'm done adulting; I'm going to Disney.&quot; The man one should say &quot;I'm done adulting; she's going to Disney.&quot; &quot;I'm working a double.&quot; &quot;I wanna go to Disney, but first, coffee.&quot; Yeah. Oh, wait. Can we get the one I saw Mickey with their arms and then Dis - &quot;Disney.&quot; I guess that's his last name, And then, uh, Minnie with I think it was one page before. &quot;I'm her Mickey,&quot; and &quot;I'm his Minnie.&quot; We could get those. That's so weird. [JACOB] It's like while Yeah, that's not gonna work, though. And sometimes I wanna walk on Dude, you break up; you wear - I wear both shirts together. I hold up the other one behind me. Yeah, you put a body pillow in the I remove one of his arms, - so he's just walking. that someone received. Photos from reviews. Oh, yuck! It's probably the screenprinting. Screenprinting issue. &quot;These Mickey and The quality is excellent. I respectfully disagree. &quot;We will be the talk of the cruise line.&quot; - That is so real. We should say, I have nothing but, like... like, uh... in some ways, affection for Disney adults. But... Maybe this is bad. Maybe I gotta kill the - That's often the answer. That level of sincerity This reminds me of a time when I was about to get on a ferry to go to, like, Angel Island or something. And, uh... - That's heaven, by the way. It's slang. The ship was a skyship. Um, I, as we were... As we were boarding the ferry, a bird shat on my shirt. Landed all over my shirt. And I had to go into a gift shop and buy another shirt. And so I went on this ferry with a shirt that said - Oh, that's awesome! wearing a shirt that says - &quot;wise beyond my beers.&quot; I don't - actually, maybe. - It's possible. - There's definitely a photo of me in it. I can pull that up for the podcast, but... With this framing, it looks like It looks like it's $11.99, and it wasn't. - It cost like $30. 'Cause it was in, like, &quot;Wise beyond my&quot; - Um... - Don't ask questions. If you're accused of drunk driving, like, - &quot;Officer, I'm wise beyond my beers.&quot; - (slurring) &quot;Stop pointing the gun at me.&quot; OK, this is a little short thing, but, um... The Color Purple, which is a 1982 novel that was turned into a 1985 movie that was turned into a 2005 musical, revived in 2015, and now being brought back uh, is in the news because of And by the way, just so we set the stage, The Color Purple is a story about a... a young Black woman growing up. It is so much about the challenges of being specifically There's a lot of domestic violence and sort of cycles of abuse, and... It's a story that's resonated for... like, a long time for a good reason. - Yeah. But it's valid, and people... find it compelling, sometimes for the right reasons, because it's an important story - and sometimes for fetish-y reasons. There's an uplifting element. Especially, like, there's been that some of the stage depictions have kind of washed away some of the nuance and kind of brightened up the characters and made them these, like, sort of picturesque heroines, when in reality the truth is messy. But it still can be a story of resilience. Um, and the, uh - The new movie has, like... It comes out on, like, Christmas day, but it's like, um... I've heard good things so far. It is big. It's got a big, star-studded cast. It's got these big musical numbers. Fantasia, who was in the Broadway production of it, is doing her first dramatic film And all those elements can exist of the discussion around it. It could be... the project is its own But anyway, it's like a seminal So who do you ask Who does WB give us? So, Warner Bros. sponsored this TikTok creator to talk about the movie, And valuable. You know, it's a story - don't even know about. And then, you know, it is a Black story, and this person is not However, doesn't mean that they can't have good, interesting things to say about it. So without judging a book - what they have to say. [TIKTOKKER] Thank you to and my crazy ideas. I am, of course, bored of my hair. So today we're doing I was inspired by the and today I'm gonna be The movie follows a girl named Celie, and it follows her transformation Also, in case you didn't know, the color purple symbolizes royalty, So, honestly, for the end of I think we could all use some purple. I actually love how this turned out. Experience the heartwarming story and share your purple transformation I guess we did summarize The Color Purple. I guess the way we should have said it is, She just lives in Georgia. - Yeah. You know, I don't know. - Went to college there. a Black woman living in Georgia? Wait, can we watch that back? She was a purple woman living in Georgia. - In the Old South. I mean, she's not seen it. - Has to be that. It's so surface-level. The, like, literal color purple. Dude, I was just thinking the After reading Ray - I decided to turn up the heat. After reading 1984, I decided to pretend I was living in 1984 when everything was really good for us. I decided to buy a calendar from 1984. You can see it has all the same I shouldn't have read Yeah, in honor of The I've bought a bunch of food. All right. Yeah, can we watch? I wanna see again how she describes the... [TIKTOKKER] ...for sponsoring - I am, of course, bored - [TIKTOKKER] ...transformacion. I was - Were you inspired by The Color Purple? You were inspired by the color purple. You were inspired - You were literally inspired by reading the word &quot;the color purple.&quot; Unless, before this, - It's never come up before. - &quot;You can put two colors together?&quot; scene in The Color Purple empower themselves by dyeing One of them goes, &quot;We could all use a little purple.&quot; [TIKTOKKER] ...purple glow-up. who lives in Georgia in the 1900s, - and it follows her - Just a girl. Also, yeah, she's not just a girl. She's like a... She's a young girl, abused by her father, - who is sold for, like, a cow. Yeah. Because you can't - That is kind of a bummer when you're It's just bizarre that you would, like... 'Cause there's quality control, as far as doing partnerships goes. Granted, we are a very but we work with advertisers and sponsors - and partners in general, and... We could've been approached We have been approached in the past. If anybody wants to approach us, feel free. But without going into names, it was like, um, for promotion for a movie. There was a potential chance of - come on the show. It just didn't work out in that instance. All the time, the producers who's prominent in a space with or anticipate either won't know which I think is kinda the target here, or know about the project if they see X or Y talk about them. This is... This went back to someone to review. - And they went, &quot;Looks good.&quot; Well, 'cause what they can't say is, like, &quot;Hey, can you talk more about Yeah, &quot;Can you talk more about - cycles of abuse?&quot; Maybe... Yeah, without naming any of the things that happen to the main character Um, before an ultimately, you know, a story of resilience, I guess. I just watched 12 Years A Guy. - In the 1800s. For like 12 years, he lived in America. He had this employer. - He was friends with Michael Fassbender. so I've dyed my hair black. &quot;I'm bored with my hair.&quot; [JARVIS] &quot;I'm bored with my hair.&quot; Throws it in the tub. I saw this movie called The Lovely Bones, - And they were beautiful. Well, one thing I'm thinking If you are trying to reach an audience... Like... at what cost? Because there's at least one person who's gonna go to this movie Going, &quot;I can't wait to be inspired!&quot; - &quot;OH MY GOD.&quot; - &quot;This is...&quot; &quot;I was not prepared for any of this. I was expecting Georgia in the 1900s. I thought we were gonna be talking &quot;I can't w - oh!&quot; Is there any purple Nope. No reason they could even tie it in. Literally the name of it. That was the whole one-two. Yeah. I actually, admittedly, don't know why the book is called The Color Purple. [JORDAN] I don't think it's I watched a movie recently and we could all use So I made an ashtray for my dad. I, um... I found a stone outside. - It seems pretty cool. - A philosopher had it. Yo, shoutouts to, uh... Shoutouts to the Harry Potter publishers - really underestimating Americans. Uh, the movie production's Was the book called Sorcerer's Stone here? It was called Sorcerer's Stone here in the UK. But, um... I'm not sure I knew but it didn't prohibit me I, like, I didn't know what Gandalf was. Yeah, 'cause the philosopher's stone is like a real, um... a mythological thing, right? - Like Nicolas Flamel and stuff? - I think? I don't know! - and yet I read the book. - [JACOB] It's a mythical object. Do they say &quot;Nicolas Flamel&quot; - Oh - hello! - Can we click on that? Please just don't be a Oh, thank god. - Oh? - Oh, we did it. - Oh, we did it. OK, we did it. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. &quot;Flamel developed a believed to have created and - (Jarvis yelling triumphantly) achieved immortality.&quot; [JARVIS] Jarvis did a thing. Anyway, guys, with the second I've created a dungeon I am calling Finally! Peace on earth! I've tied up my I bought three dogs to sit outside. What up, guys? Just read the third book, and I am going to Alcatraaaaz. It used to be a jail, so I'm gonna do a &quot;24 hours in jail&quot; challenge!&quot; Staying in gen pop for 24 hours! - She rocks. I've set this goblet on fire. - Ow, ow! This sucks! I should have talked to I mean, hey, dude. I... Maybe - I honestly would put this mainly on the shoulders 'cause it was a tactless choice, and also they should have been so explicit of what she needs to communicate. It could not be, &quot;Hey, and then they basically just or a screener of the movie Sometimes you should if you don't feel like you... uh... can contribute in a productive way, maybe? It depends. Sometimes people need a check. So I don't know this person's situation. - But the risks here... are so... high... that I would give it a second look. And maybe they did. Maybe they gave it She kept talking about slavery, - This is a bummer.&quot; I mean, I think there's a genuine - This could be my ex-partnerships I think there's a very good chance that she was guaranteed a pretty and when they got the production back and they're like, &quot;This is very bad,&quot; they may have given feedback, like... &quot;Well, we got two rounds of feedback. We did both. It didn't get any better.&quot; &quot;Those were contractually how many rounds &quot;We are not allowed to do any more, and the minimum guarantee was $40,000.&quot; And it's like, &quot;Well, my manager He won't understand why. Fine, we'll pay you the $60,000 instead. - Just publish it.&quot; I generally wanna be Uh, it is hard to imagine a situation - where you do this in good faith. to do a upbeat post, a Shorts clip, about Crazy Rich Asians. And it's like, &quot;Top 10 craziest Asians!&quot; - No! Hard no. I don't - yeah, it's like... I mean, the only thing it's a privilege to be able to But again, this is a situation where... if you are to do it I would expect you to, at the very least, Google anything other than the name of - With great power, right? You gotta... it's your responsibility. I mean, god, dude. I hope nobody... there's not a bunch of &quot;I love her new hair! I'm doing the same! It's about a guy that lived on a... a bunch of years ago. It was a guy that worked at a Or even, I feel like - OK. Another thing that I think - is cosplay of, like... You know? Of the period, uh, characters who were in dire straits. - Dude, in that fucking - I was gonna say commodification You know, this is media for money, right? - People are making money on this. Yeah. But at the same time, - Squid Game, the reality competition. It gives people - It puts people in a position where ungodly, like, abominable thing that lot of bad stuff, but, &quot;Oh, I love the outfits.&quot; And then you end up with that photoshoot - from that plantation wedding. Where the Black husband is wearing chains and she is a, I guess, - that she's liberating him. Finally. - Um... So, some people did respond. I wanted to look at one of these responses, which I haven't seen. - [TIKTOKKER] ...the movie and share your purple [THEEOFFICIALJUJU] The way that I've for the last five minutes, I literally had to go to if she was deadass. And she was. She is. What movie... did you watch? 'Cause it couldn't have been that I watched. It certainly couldn't have been. We're just gonna go across the obvious fact that WB could have partnered up with any Black creator on this app, because the movie The Color Purple is predominantly a Black cast. And then on top of that, it is chronicling a Black woman's trauma. So we're just gonna brush past that. And not even really just because the movie is pretty dark. But the book? Oh my gosh. Please read the book by Alice Walker, because I promise you it is At all. So, here's a little synopsis, in case you never read the book So, The Color Purple is and it is about a girl who grows up down South in the 1900s, and she writes letters to God. We basically see her grow up, and she is constantly abused, SAed, she gets married off to a guy that's like three times her age, she's torn away from her family, torn away from her kids, and we basically have to see her The book and both the uh, SA, racism, classism, just trauma, and just being a Black woman But yeah. Yeah. It's... really heartwarming. - Really heartwarming. Just wanna shout out @theeofficialjuju, um, the creator that made that. - J-U-J-U, is i? I mean, the obvious answer to - No movie. However, the TikTok comments, of course, &quot;God, these days people Such a big drama, just What's she supposed to do? - Holy shit! - Dye it. - As your roots grow out on your skin. false dichotomy I've ever seen. - Like, what?! Talk about the movie! Like, what are you supposed to do? Those are the exact same people that, if you do blackface they defend you and go, &quot;What? - Yeah. - They're offended. What scale? Is it like if As long as I'm not personally involved, - I can't be bothered by something? God, what can you say? &quot;Um, a little bit rasist [sic], aren't you? The movie is predominantly Black, the Black creator. Be for real.&quot; How'd they spell &quot;predominantly&quot; [JARVIS] Yeah, that's pretty wild. But, like, you're wrong. And the point is valid. Like, I assumed that they were paying multiple creators across the board to promote the movie, as you often would for, um, promoting a movie. But if they're not reaching out that's wild. [JORDAN] I'm sure there is, uh, some. I mean, there would be no reason not to. very cynical side of me, that's like... They chose her because they think she'll bring in an audience &quot;Well, the Black people - the movie about Black trauma.&quot; Yeah. &quot;They're gonna - remember - &quot;What do you want? We made the one.&quot; - &quot;We made the movie about you guys.&quot; I just wanna - this is just, &quot;A little bit rasist.&quot; &quot;Yes, babes, my bad.&quot; Oh, OK. Yeah, that's a very silly take. - Uh, also... The options are not &quot;choose a &quot;choose a white person to promote They want to be walked through compassion so step by step. So many of these where you're like, No, things related to race aren't racist. That's not the beginning You can talk about race, It's not a thing you either ignore - or is bad. They're acknowledging The fact that it is a white creator that did basically the reason you should be cautious about getting is that they either have non-self-focused statement to make about it that's informed, and maybe which a lot of them just don't... or you go, like, &quot;I bought Gucci slides, 'cause &quot;I went to an NBA game. - You know, for 12 Years a Slave.&quot; are Black people.&quot; - Yeah, those 1900s-style guys. &quot;I voted for Obama - at the 2016 election.&quot; &quot;In support of The Color Purple - Yeah. Um... Again, this is also not an endorsement We haven't seen it. - No, I just read a review about it. valuable, impactful. It is... There is nothing and the idea that you would with blackface as the example just shows how little because they finally - I feel like dipshits online &quot;Fine, blackface is bad. OK. Fine. Now I'll use that.&quot; Yeah. They're like, &quot;Ugh. We... I let blackface be bad. So now you're offended about something - the racist goalpost.&quot; - &quot;When can I be racist anymore?&quot; &quot;Everything I seem to do is racist!&quot; Yeah. And a Black person's It's like, &quot;SHUT UP. Yeah. Again... This would not have blown up the same way if this creator had demonstrated that they knew anything about the property. And even if you haven't if you're doing a brand deal, - you're being paid money in exchange for - - You're not doing your job fully then. Or if they don't give you a screener, watch the old movie, or read the book. Read the SparkNotes You could've avoided this backlash by doing so many things Also, if anybody wants to &quot;You guys didn't watch the movie,&quot; we didn't get paid to watch the movie. It also isn't out yet, and I can't do that. Our take on the movie or &quot;I don't know, we just didn't even look it [JARVIS] Yeah. Yeah, it's just us criticizing her wig. Like we don't give her any feedback. Oh, right. That's our response. We just go, &quot;Um, dude, this wig is kinda weak.&quot; &quot;What can you say anymore?&quot; All right. Well, anyway, shoutout Anyway, shoutout to @theeofficialjuju. Um, we'll leave a link to the original TikTok in the description. OK, last thing we have was partially inspired by the fact that included this guy Yeah. And I didn't look at this guy, but I did do a video about - a different street interviewer. - [JARVIS] They all are very similar. I'm so fascinated. And this is just a - it's been around. - It's been... Um, around. For a while. But there's always new ones. where there's just always - I guess this kind of is but there's always new ones. I think it's, uh, appealing to the same demographic with more deniability. Like, it's almost like this is the... alt-right incel version of - linking to a study or an article. And being like, &quot;Yeah, OK.&quot; If you link to, I don't know... It's kinda the appeal of Jordan 'cause if you link to an Andrew Tate thing it's just kinda him riffing, and and he's just like, &quot;Actually, And then instead, if you you know, a hot debate, then you can say, &quot;Well, actually, it's objectively true that women care because there's this saying it out loud in an interview - Yeah. And so this went mega-viral. Everybody's probably already seen it, but I wanna start here and then Or is up to. Not what he's into. Well, we'll see what we can find. This is the most valuable... the most valuable education Yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn. Steven Crowder-ass bullshit, dude. Why...? - That is such a stupid choice. Because it's like, those things are It's just literally like, the only two talking points that they can throw to that makes them sound informed, &quot;Stop replacing Christmas stop letting the people You can't say that. Instead, [JORDAN] &quot;I'll choose the economy.&quot; &quot;Do I eat my lunch, or do I text my mom?&quot; It's like, OK, you can... How long is texting your mom But that's not the question. But why would you ask a question where the two things are so easily conceivable to be done together? I am winning this. [JORDAN] I'm gonna post this one. Legend, dude! He's so... The Bluetooth headset. The Wolverine jacket. The ponytail of - This guy won before he said a word. You were saying this earlier, but it looks like if you hadn't seen how much you would think it had already repeated. It is like, honestly, if it weren't and the constant snap zooms and stuff, it does feel like a, &quot;Was this... is this like a Tim &amp; Eric bit?&quot; The laugh is awesome. When he goes &quot;hmhmhmhmhm.&quot; It's like, &quot;You've fallen Tyler ports behind you. Dude, yeah. He's literally gonna walk away, and the dude is gonna fall It's, uh, turns to white-on-red silhouette. The kanji for &quot;death&quot; appears, really big. Yeah, this guy is - this is He's harnessed the powers. I saw some really good &quot;You underestimated my power. For years I lurked in the shadows. I trained in the annals of Discord.&quot; &quot;While you were kissing girls, Yeah. But, I mean, he's - Let's be honest. - Um... Kinda goes hard. - It's like a Motorola Razr. because of a thing that happens and someone's talking out loud, and I go, &quot;If you want the and he's like, &quot;No, fucking idiot. - I got one of these!&quot; And I go, &quot;Ah, I'm sorry. I'm so stupid.&quot; &quot;I'm at the store asking someone Maybe, I don't know, uh, it needs to be more obvious. - Wear like a full-on thing. It should be steaming. - You should be able to hear it whirring. - gamer chair, like, in the grocery store. You should have to have a mech. Like a X... Fucking, what's the racer...? DXRacer? What the hell - Ooh. Oh, yeah. - The gamer chair? I think so. They don't really race, do they? I'm kind of... I know things, dude. Yeah, DXRacer. Remember - That was the highlight of my day. That was my Reddit mod moment. &quot;I deny the... actually discovering it.&quot; Outside of this weird scenario, Yeah. I also need to point out... He's bad at discourse. He's bad at... He's bad at whatever he's trying to do, 'cause he can't seem to move past a dialogue option once someone has... He's been stonewalled after - he didn't expect. He did a speech check, failed, and he keeps - It's greyed out. that he has a &quot;my pronouns Wait. - That's pretty funny, dude. - Because have you seen these people? Did you see these guys? There's, like, online, you go to bio, it says something else? - What? &quot;He/him&quot;? - Oh, right. Pronouns. So what I have is two other words. - (sighs) Yeah. No, you owned me, actually. That's not one of the answers. Oh, actually, you know what? Oh, that's right, yeah. - To having pronouns? &quot;Find or Jesus&quot; is the way that Uh, by the way... If this is how you, air-quote, &quot;debate,&quot; this is not your craft. This is not your job. It'd be like if my job was - Yeah. Again, dude, the comments... Like, the person that said what do you think you're doing? Like, &quot;I know the answer. I've solved the unsolvable conundrum.&quot; Biden scrolling through the comments - like, &quot;Well, shit. I guess...&quot; Pumping his fist secretly. &quot;You can absolutely have both.&quot; Discord mod: &quot;The answer Actually, funnily enough, these 'Cause the one, the left ponytail Reddit-type guy, is someone that people make fun of for the aesthetics of being a Discord mod, but every single time a Discord mod they look a little bit more It's usually a pretty basic, with a T-shirt that says something like &quot;Pickle Rick is better The guy on the left is usually Dwarf Fortress or something. Dude, he is so Dwarf Fortress-coded. And it's because he looks like, uh, the host of a podcast I listened to Was it you? Who also has a ponytail and I think it's cute. I think it's a cute look. I mean, to be - his principles help. like, listened for 15 years of my life I wish we could have a ponytail. - Yeah. I can't do it. It's a lot of... I guess a wig. - I guess we could wig. and then when I did it, I did it in - &quot;No, no, no.&quot; &quot;This cannot be.&quot; [JORDAN] It looped! When faced with adversity, this guy - What is the saying? Insanity is trying the same thing twice and expecting different results? That's what this feels like, because... It's almost like he failed, - which was almost nothing. And then just went back He quickloaded. He's, like, save-scumming. Yeah. He's save-scumming! Yeah, he actually went, - I need to reboot.&quot; Yeah. &quot;I'm gonna swipe away and maybe it's not lagged.&quot; Yeah, he's trying to Also, it's very funny for - a debate you started to then just go, &quot;Are you trolling? - Are you trying to troll me?&quot; This is me when I mistype in my password. - Oh, yeah. &quot;Must be wrong.&quot; Then I type in exactly the same thing - and I realize I don't know my password. - This computer's so stupid.&quot; - &quot;No, but this is my password.&quot; - the caps lock's on. I have my eyes closed. Yeah. My hands were offset on the keyboard, It's also a different website. Um, I also wanna say there's something about - Like, if you do a street interview thing, there's a level to which I respect it, because you... - have to post your own Ls because of the content, which is such a funny... It's such a funny conundrum where you go, &quot;Ah, man, I got destroyed. - But I do need views.&quot; - &quot;And I have no choice.&quot; they just lack the judgment - to know it's bad. Like, it's rare, but uh, talk about something and be like, &quot;Ah, that should probably be private,&quot; or skip past it or something. If... We say &quot;cut that&quot; because - &quot;That's probably not the best call.&quot; If I was having this debate I would, on instinct, be like, &quot;Not putting - I'm gonna stop having it.&quot; &quot;I'm gonna burn the phone that it's on.&quot; &quot;I'm gonna reboot the phone &quot;I'm changing careers. I think you are right, because he gave this the caption &quot;why'd he make this so difficult - #comedy #npc #lgbt #viral.&quot; &quot;Why are you making this so difficult? There's no shot this is your final. This sounds like one of those lines rehearse to get out of it, like, Right. Oh, yeah, true. &quot;I'm trying to pass my final.&quot; Yeah. So maybe - 'cause or at least he hashtagged &quot;college,&quot; and He's visibly distressed. This is actually very funny, because the body language is awesome. The guy on the left is happy, jeering, - like he's just chilling. - Yeah, we gotta do the line test. Yeah. Um, this guy's got This guy's able to stand perfectly still 'cause his huge hog is weighing him down. He's off-center 'cause it's going down - one of his legs. If this is your class project, Oh, Vine boom. Dub. Oh, and that's it. - Yeah. - Mutual respect amongst opponents. This is like the end of the basketball but you have to be a sportsman. - You have to be a cool guy about it. - like people call you a bad teammate. and one person puts out for a fist bump, and the other one takes - Oh, yeah. That happens in boxing, too. This is - he... Look, respect to @shaneyyricch. - Um, for... doing a handshake. I'll rescind a little bit of the respect for being a dumbass that's can't properly articulate himself, Other than that... and also, go to a barber But other than that, dude, big respect. Very #funny #comedy #viral. - It's so funny - I would so sooner... Like, making a statement - is so anti-ever looking nice. Like, you just look like... You look bad. I'll just say it like that. - And the text is gonna - - which is also bad. I mean, it's just gonna... You wash that one time. - Oh, yeah. It's gonna peel off, - by him in his fucking garage. - 'Cause who's selling that shirt? It's just so embarrassing. - It's sad. It's so... It's odd to think of... It makes sense that somebody that would has so little self-awareness &quot;why'd he make this so (whiny) &quot;I'm trying to pass my final.&quot; - I really wanna know what that means. concession to make. Like... - (both whining) &quot;Pleeeease.&quot; - &quot;Be nice! I'm tired! Please stop!&quot; &quot;I'm an empath. - Why are you doing this?&quot; Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, dude, he's like, &quot;Oh, - My man was not ready for the Wildy. so he's like, &quot;Oh, shit, I need - &quot;I should've killed those rats.&quot; and ask them these questions, and they'll &quot;And then maybe I can kind of - and move up the chain.&quot; He's trying to fight the elder dragon Ender dragon. You're gonna get destroyed. No. Maybe I was talking - OK, OK. - That is the - ? Oh, no. - Jacob, swap the way we said it. - [JACOB] Sorry, no. You're canceled. I don't understand our edit process at all. Yeah, it's actually live. Why are you playing it twice? Um, can we look at - What other crimes against humanity? what other class projects he's done. - Yeah, he's trying to get to his final. Imagine that, dude. He's just gotta interview people and figure out - This guy crushing him. - That's the best thing I've ever seen. If you're out there, which I assume he is. But if, uh, this warrior, this hero - Wants to call us on your Bluetooth headset. Hit us up. We will - - If you do a Cameo-type video for us - If you just say &quot;happy holidays&quot; swing a replica katana, I will give you any amount of money. I just wanna ask him another &quot;Do you want cheese or pepperoni I just want him to do that entire &quot;You can't say that. That's not right.&quot; &quot;Are you trolling me? - I have to go to school.&quot; &quot;I have to do the whole alphabet today.&quot; Well, this was fun. And the fun don't stop, [JARVIS] Non-denominationally, or whatever. [JORDAN] I'm bringing the other... Um, over on Patreon.com/SadBoyz, we are - OK, that's not - that's fine. We are going to be doing We're gonna drink mulled wine. We're gonna get a little topsy-turvy, a little tipsy-dipsy, and, um... and hang. What else are we doing? - We've got other stuff.
