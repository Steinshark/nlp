Oh, good morning, blessings and activity to the best sisters. How are you girls? Please reassure me about you. God willing, you will be well. Oh Lord. You are preparing today's video. Today's video is such a vital activity, cleaning and hygiene. And also such recipes for receiving the Turkish neighbor. I came to you with a story. I will tell you what happened to me and how I received her so quickly and hastily. I caught up, got my affairs in order, and prepared for my hospitality, but the first thing I want is for you to give me this video for 5,000 likes. Also, if you are not yet a subscriber to the channel, subscribe and activate the bell on everyone so that you can receive everything new from me. Here I am, I am awake with my enthusiasm and activity, and I do not mean energy, so that's a thousand. You knew how, so I said I want to make the refrigerator. What's wrong with my account on this day? I want to put a dry cleaning on the refrigerator. I mean, I don't usually wipe the shelves. I wipe, for example, dirty ones like that, but I don't remove the shelves. She removed the shelves and put them all together. I only do it every once in a while, meaning I want to put the hood on and I want to start the oven. I was there and I was working. Like this, while Matn Shatta had the camera open, she called my neighbor and told me that, God willing, I would be two hours late for you, that instead of the clock, you would kill me at 4:00, when she called me. This is how I remembered that a week ago, I was dating her on this day, and that she would come to me and visit me, so I said: I felt that the ground wanted to open up and swallow me because the first time she wanted to visit me, she would miss my house, and the second thing I meant was that she was not in the kitchen and at work, and his house had the refrigerator stuff and was emptying it, so I said, "But I finished the fridge, I meant the stuff like that." She finished it in the end, the fridge, but without the freezer. I mean, I didn't go near the freezer, but outside I finished it. I said, "I still have two hours." I mean, in that time, I went and brought a basket to school and came back home. I said, "I have time," so he can do two things like this for me. Come on, the Turks are here, because they do salty things. I mean, over a cup of tea, they tell you that you are willing to have a cup of tea or to sit down for a cup of tea. We are the Syrians, meaning determination. On coffee, on mate, on these things they have for tea. I mean, this is necessary for tea, so I have to make these things that are salty, so I said, I have to make two dishes like this, and here they are, for example, by receiving them and eating a third of them like this, to my taste. I mean, these are what I make and they like a lot of things done, whatever the things are. I am present from the outside. By God, as I told you, I finished the refrigerator. I quickly filled it, and then I started with the recipes and said, I opened the camera and opened it. I will share with you the recipes that I made in some of them. I shared them before on the channel in some of them. This does not mean that it is still the first time. I will share with you, and by the way, on the occasion of the recipes, which I mean, I am talking about.

I will take ideas from you about making them and take pictures of them and post them to you. Hey, why did I level the refrigerator because it is empty as you saw? I mean, there is no greenery in it. These things. Sometimes it will be empty if I want to wipe it. I mean, sometimes it will be empty if I wipe it, or if I want to use it like that at that time. I mean, if it's empty, or I want to fill it, for example, or I'll get some green stuff to wrap it, I mean, I'll take advantage of this time, which is not a lot of time, and I wipe it like that from the outside, and it's polished by tissues. This perfume has a lot of polishing agents, especially stainless steel, and things like that mean a lot of polishing. And this spray is put in the refrigerator, too. I forgot. I'll tell you about it, too. I got it from a large, large filet. It smells good. It's made of sterilized vinegar and lemon. I mean, it's meant for things like this. I mean, make it safe. So, I also put the sink in it like this. I made the refrigerator, the heart of the refrigerator , the microwave, and the bottle I made in it. I made it clean because it cleans and at the same time gives a strong shine, like you would like to do. I mean, they put oil like that and wiped it and polish. You know how? By God, I wiped the entire magazine and the food table, too, because I didn't put the things like that on the sink and on the table, so you know, all the time, and so on, so I did a quick wipe of everything and then started with the food. I mean, I like to start cleaning it so that it's all tidy in front of me, I know. What do I want to do and not get confused? As you know, with photography, it takes more time. The more organized the matter is, the faster the work will be. The first thing I will do is to make Turkish pukahs, because I have yufka flakes. If I don't have them, I can make them with baklava flour or dough on my own hands, but I would. I want to make some kind of pastry because I have them. I said I would make a burek. First thing I put a cup of milk, an egg , a little olive oil, salt and pepper. Mix them together and put them aside. Then I brought the yufka tortillas, which is a dough that comes to your name, a little bit of baklava dough. I cut it like a sleeve. You see, the first thing is half, then I made them. Also, the half is cut into two halves so that they become such triangles. Then I started with the filling. The filling was cheese. I have cheese, which is paralyzed, but this way it comes out a little sweet and rinses a lot. It is nice for the filling. Or maybe any type of cheese, I mean, from the cheese, or the lor cheese is also cute. She stuffed them with her heart first thing. She cut them because she is a long-term paralyzed woman. She cut them and stuffed them with her heart and started to arrange them in Chinese. Now, after I understand them all, he described them in Chinese. I want to put this mixture that I made after the eggs and milk, drown them in it, and leave them like that for half the work. An hour until they drink all the milk and eggs so that the piece comes out soft on the inside because it is the type of yufka or tortilla dough. If it is not like that, it is just separated or you leave the liquids behind it to be too much, it will come out hard or so, even if you admit that it feels like this, it is tough. I mean, it is not a penny, but it is a penny on the face. And since it is soft on the inside, you have to let it get a lot of liquid so that it comes out so good, nice and tender on the inside, so I drowned them in it and put a few black seeds in it and left it on the side for her to drink. Now I will make the second meal, which is the palace that we have. This means she peed. I mean, it looks like it, but she peed, but that means we put it in for her. A lot of green and stuff here. I put a cup and a half of fine bulgur. I will soak it in a cup and a quarter of hot water to open the grain well. I left the bulgur aside until the grains open well. I told him to cut the vegetables. At this time, they will put green mint, green onion, parsley, and lettuce. Can they put dried onions like this? Tell me with her, but what will I do with her? She has this method. What will I do? I will make the frying pan alone , with the vegetables alone. Let me tell you what the vegetables mean here. I only put cucumber, lettuce, and parsley. This is what I have. Come on, everything. I am preparing it today, but what I have is available. Did you know how I did not buy it? Something from the outside, I mean, I tried to say that he was someone who was in the house, because he didn't go out. I would go out and go shopping and make meals. He would invent dishes. I mean, there is no time required, within an hour and a half, to prepare these foods for me to go out. He prepared the table. He prepared the living room for the reception. You knew how I cut the vegetables, put them on the side, and put them in the pot like that. A little olive oil, I fried an onion, I put a spoonful of pepper molasses and a spoonful of tomato molasses, I fried them well and put them on the bulgur, then I put salt and some mint and also a lot of cumin. Cumin is important in it, meaning it gives it a very good taste, and as for the puff and some red pepper or rica, it means it mixes well together. You don't want to knead the kneading, but you mix and stir, which means you don't have to mix it together or mix it together, it has to be like that. In the meantime, I put a baking tray in the oven. I said, while I'm working, prepare the third recipe and perfect the recipe, meaning just season it with lemon and pomegranate molasses and put the vegetables in it before serving, so that the recipe remains fresh. The third is a lot of date biscuits, which are good, meaning healthy, because they are at home, and they are economical and very cute for children in schools. I mean, I think they are very sweet. I wanted to share them with you. First of all, I brought two eggs, put half a cup of sugar on them, and a vanilla packet. We beat them well together to lighten the color. Then I added to them. A cup of vegetable oil, or if you like ghee or butter, but the texture of the biscuits differs. I mean, if you add butter, it becomes like gharibiya. If we put ghee, it becomes like the maamoul we make, and if you put oil, it becomes biscuits. Did you know how, after mixing them together, you put the last thing in flour? Half a kilo of flour. They take half a kilo of flour. He also takes an envelope of baking powder and a pinch of salt. Knead it well together. You also put a quarter or half a cup of water in it, depending on what the dough takes, but not a lot. And I don't knead them too much until the dough gets hard with us. Then you put them on the side. Then you bring the pasta and the pasta. Even like that, I wanted to put a spoonful of ghee in it. Since I made the dough with oil, it does not taste good. I put the animal ghee on the dates and kneaded them with some cardamom pods, but I put the core of the cardamom, that is, without it being ground, because its taste is still there, not like this soft one. You can feel the spirit of its taste. I put them all together like this, I mixed them, and then I started rolling them out. The dough is as you can see. This is an easy and quick method that does not take time because you feel like making it with a pinch or with a mold or whatever you want, but it takes time, but with this method it does not take time at all. I mean, the whole meal did not take more than half an hour to bake, cut, and stuff, meaning all of them together. And I put it in the oven. Also, in the oven, it does not take much time. I mean, I baked it for 10-12 minutes. I put such a roll with dates in its core, and I rolled it a turn and a half so that some biscuits came out. It was followed by more than the usual. Did you know how I found them with some sesame seeds? It had a drop of honey in it. Or would you like to put some water in it? So that it sticks to it, I put it in the tray, I stacked them together so that they would not dry out much. This little thing does not dry out . The oven has a heater because it is already puddling in its heart, so it will not take more than 12 minutes. The oven from above and below together is running at a temperature of 200. They will come out delicious and their color will be very sweet, except for your smell. The house that smells like cakes made on maamoul biscuits has a lot of sweet smell, so try it you won't regret it. Now here is the last thing. I put half a tea cup of pomegranate molasses, half a tea cup of olive oil, and the juice of a whole lemon. I put the vegetables in with them, and that's how I stirred them well until they were all mixed together. I put some of them in the last place on the serving plate and decorated them with a piece of lemon or a slice of lemon. And here I also had the breakage ready and I left them until they cooled down so that I could remove them from the bowl, because a lot of people come out and say that. They also say fried and a lot of good food. I opened it and brought you half of it. How do you get it so soft from the inside and from the outside? It is being cooked. On this same day, the settlements. I was recommending a cake from my friend who works with cakes, so I bequeathed two cakes, half for Bayan and half for Tariq Bayan and Tariq Khalqan on the same day at 171. They do not have twins. Many of you have asked me about it. On Instagram, it is the birthday of the same day. Are they twins or not? No, they are not twins, but they are coming on the same day for 171. Come on, make a wish. They are right. They have become adults. Tariq has become 17 years old, and Bayan is 20 years old. May God protect you and your children, O Lord, but like this, it means that any small things will continue to remain. We are happy if it is from gifts, if it is from cake, if it is from interest, then I loved this, so I will surprise you with this cake. Other than the gifts, the gifts had continued since before Christmas, so this was our day, and this was our party, and thank God they were very happy, I mean, with the cake, the surprise , and the gifts for you, the autumn leaves, Sila, remember when you were doing activities. I hand over the paper to Lance. We twist the pure orange until it has a color on it. I love this. This is sweet. It's the same as the brown one . The past year has been a lot and here is the next day. My friend and I were promised to go to this bazaar, which is any bazaar called Beylikdzu or not Beylikdzu, close to the Novia above the Novi. I mean, it is known that this bazaar is very nice and there are a lot of things in it. I mean, there are such special brands that you can find things that are cheap. Things that you can't find outside like that. In the past, I used to look for costs like this that deteriorate in nature. I mean, on his sweater, on his work. Maybe we can even add it to a plain sweater that has changed. Because it looks like we can put it on, for example, a piece that was beaten from a place, and it is still new. The piece is also like this. You see, we are not cheap. There are a lot of nice things that I also found from them, so I wanted to give you a tour of this bazaar, and I will show you some of the stories and things that are in it. I love shinati, jackets, room stories. Sleep means that there are many forbidden ways in sweet stories. It is a well-known bazaar here in Istanbul. The world brings it from the end of the world. I mean, until they reach it, it is the same bazaar that has transportation from the municipality. I mean, it goes through all of Esenyurt, taking the world to and from the bazaar. I mean, they take the bazaar and come back, and it has appointments and everything. An hour and a half passes, one person goes by, one person goes by, one person lives in my life. The bazaar is open every Saturday and Thursday. On Saturday, I only wear clothes and vegetables on Thursdays, meaning I eat. I am telling you the details of this bazaar so that whoever wants to go to this bazaar can find the details. Here, turn the video. These have roses, too. They also have beautiful fragments, very beautiful colours. It's so sweet, it's one of the best ones. I took these boots and these things from the bazaar. I took them to Sila. They are very, very nice, and their quality is heavy. I mean, they are not light, and they are not even designed from home. Also, their price is 300 lira. I took them and made them in such shapes and such stories, and these are the ones I told you about that come with them. This is like a print or a cost. We say to her that she is very cute. The cat has her glasses, and she is the cat who purred, and this sheep is also such a sweet thing for him. And this is the Eiffel Tower. They are very cute. I loved them a lot. I mean, I said, "I will return, and I used to own one of them, but I bought them for the leftovers because they are very expensive." It is five liras a piece, and I found these pillow faces as well. They are the type that I love. The zipper is hidden, and the type is cotton, so heavy, very cute.
