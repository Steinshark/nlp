[Music] Over the next two days, I'll be climbing Middle Hi. I'm Evan from Within Hiking Distance and I'm at the Pole Creek Trailhead in Oregon. I'm here with the Mazamas it's mid-June. And today we'll climb to our base camp, just below the Hayden Glacier which is 5 miles, 1500 feet of elevation to get there. Tomorrow we'll get an alpine start to begin our summit climb to Middle Sister. And then we'll hike all the way back to the trailhead. It should be a fun two days and I'll be filming along the way. The Pole Creek Trailhead is located in the Three Sisters Wilderness and is about ten and a half miles from Sisters, Oregon. [Music] The parking lot is fairly big and can accommodate many vehicles. At 10am our group of 12 started our hike to base camp. There is limited shade on the Pole Creek Trail, however, the climb offers a great alpine experience with rewarding panoramic views. [Music] North Sister is in full view while hiking to base camp. While Middle Sister is located right behind it. [Music] Just over a mile and a half in. 580 feet of elevation gain. Still walking through the forest that got burnt out some time ago. [Music] There's a few trees in the trail, so we have to make our own trail around them. [Music] We're two and a half miles into our hike. Went up 650 feet of elevation so far. I'm just going through this old burnt out forest that's occurred in 2012. So we're halfway to base camp. And it's going well. It's just a gradual hike going up. [Music] Just over four miles in. Over a 1000 feet of elevation gain. We're out of the burnt out forest now. Heading up. As you can see there's a snow all around us now that we're walking on. It's pretty good so far. [Music] Just made our way out of the tree line. About to set up camp Got some great views of South Sister, Middle Sister and north sister behind me. Everybody's setting up camp where we'll be for the night and then we'll start early tomorrow morning. [Music] That evening we all made our preparations for the climb the following morning. [Music] It's 4:30 in the morning. Everybody's just finishing getting ready, And we're just about to leave. We have some great weather today. No clouds in sight. And a Middle Sister just behind me looking good. It's going to be a great day for a summit. [Music] Just after 6:30am. Left base camp around 5:30. A little bit later than we expected. Middle Sister right behind me. Weather is looking great. Snow is great. So we should make it up there in a good time and get some great views. [Music] We had Pushkar and Peter as our Mazama's climbing leads on this trip. [Music] As we started to gain elevation going up the Hayden Glacier, we got some amazing views of the surrounding mountains. [Music] We did not have to rope up while ascending. We were able to stay to the right and avoid the area with crevasses. We made good time with the firm snow and made it up past the saddle and to the North Ridge. From there the ground was bare in some spots or had some hard packed snow. [Music] On the North Ridge, we came across a steep section not too far from the summit. [Music] We stopped for a little bit. Pushkar is putting in a fixed line. It's a little sketchy on this side. Pretty icy too. So everybody's just waiting down below. [Music] We took turns clipping into each section of the fixed line. It was quite steep going up. [Music] I just climbed up the fixed rope portion, and it went all right. Pretty tired. Getting some great views. Waiting for folks to come up. North Sister right over there. We got a bunch of other volcanoes right there. Three Fingered Jack, Washington, Jefferson, and Hood way back there. Spectacular all the way around. [Music] We waited for everyone to complete the fixed line section before we went to the summit. [Music] Just made it to the summit a Middle Sister. 10,047 feet. Made great time. Everybody's looking good. Excited to be here . Everybody's taking photos. Got great views of South Sister and all the other mountains around. So that was a that was a fun climb. &quot;It was good. I thought I was gonna die.&quot; &quot;Did not die, so it was good.&quot; &quot;We did not die today. We prevailed&quot; &quot;We have to get down&quot; &quot;Hey, don't remind me.&quot; &quot;You know. Working past some fear of falling.&quot; &quot;But hey, we did it and I'm feeling great.&quot; &quot;I can't bend my fingers. They're cold&quot; [Music] Further to the left. The white one. That's Mount Scott down in Crater Lake National Park. [Music] We're on our way down. To get past the steep part we're gonna boot kick our way down. The snow softened up enough where we can do that. [Music] Aardra from our team cleaned all the pickets and rope off the fixed line section on the way down. [Music] The snow had softened up considerably since we ascended in the morning, and it was a pleasant hike down to camp. [Music] I'm pretty happy. I get glissade a little bit. I think this is the only stretch. [Music] We just made it back to base camp. Everybody was able to summit. And we were able to boot kick our way down where Snow conditions were ideal today. Big thanks to the Mazamas, Pushkar, and Peter for setting this up. It was an awesome trip and be sure to like this video and subscribe. Thanks! [Music]
