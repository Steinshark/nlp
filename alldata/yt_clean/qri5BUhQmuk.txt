This stray dog mom is named Nailao and often appears near the house. Up until today, people have been feeding her intermittently. This morning, I noticed she was carrying her pup to my doorstep. She carried the pup right in front of me. I told Nailao that if she wanted me to take in her puppies, she could take me to her nest to check it out. It seemed like she understood; she picked up her pup and started leading me. She led me through a winding path, and when we reached the woods, I couldn't follow her any further. Maybe Nailao gave birth to her puppies in the woods. I don't know her exact location now, as I lost track of her. The next day, Nailao brought me a little spotted pup. She might have thought I didn't like the white pup from yesterday. Today, I'm determined to find her nest. Nailao placed the pup beside me. Seeing that I didn't pick up her baby, she walked over and occasionally glanced at her pup. She kept signaling for me to take her pup away. Nailao struggled to carry her pup, as it kept slipping from her mouth. Seeing her struggle, I helped hold the pup. But she kept looking longingly at her baby. So I gave the pup back to her, but she still couldn't carry it properly. The little pup kept slipping from Nailao's mouth. Then Nailao grabbed the pup by its leg and started walking, so I followed her, hoping to find her nest today. The little one crawled inside. It was an old tent--could this be where Nailao gave birth? After looking around, I found Nailao's nest here. She was hiding inside, nursing her puppies in this secluded spot. When Nailao returned, her pups immediately latched onto her to nurse. I took a closer look to see how many pups she had. I counted three puppies, but I remembered Nailao had also brought me a little spotted pup that isn't here. I found the spotted pup nearby, left by Nailao. I'll bring it back to her nest. It seems Nailao went back into the nest without caring for her pup. Now, with all the puppies here, they eagerly start nursing. I told Nailao to take good care of her puppies while I get some food for her. Since I have to go to work on the construction site later, I don't have time to cook for Nailao, so I'll give her a gourmet can. I added some premium dog food and her favorite freeze-dried treats. With so many dogs and cats at home, I have a lot of dog food stocked. Once everything was ready, I brought the food over and called her to eat. But after calling her for a while, Nailao wouldn't come out. So, I started feeding her bit by bit at her side. After a few bites, she got hooked and finally got up to eat on her own. Here's more of her favorite freeze-dried treats. The poor thing was really hungry. Nailao's life hasn't been easy. She survives by scavenging from many people's homes, so she often struggles to get enough food. Whenever I see her, I give her lots of treats. She finished the whole bowl, and worried she might be thirsty, I brought her a bowl of water. After eating so much, she was definitely parched. As she drank, her puppies wriggled beneath her. After giving her some water, I had to head to work. I left the water nearby for her and told her to drink whenever she's thirsty. On the fourth day, Nailao's young owner came home for the weekend and found the dogs gone, bursting into tears. It had rained heavily the night before, so I moved Nailao's family inside since their nest was outdoors. Today, I plan to cook some fish for Nailao to nourish her. First, I put the fish in to boil since it's a bit salty. Once it softened, I removed the fish bones for Nailao. Then I added some dog food, a gourmet can, and a bit of fish broth for flavor. After mixing it all, I plated it to bring it to Nailao. When I opened the door, my cat Sunset was waiting outside. I let her sniff it but didn't give her any; this is for the dog, not the cat. Then I brought the meal to Nailao. She must have heard me coming because she was already waiting inside for me. After a couple of bites, she ran back inside, likely worried that someone might touch her puppies while she ate. Just a few bites in, she ran to check on her pups. Nailao is truly a devoted mother. Because of the heavy rain last night, I moved her puppies inside. Though it's not very clean here, it's better than being soaked outside. If I can help her, I will. After all, every little bit makes a difference. Nailao would take a few bites and lift her head to check, afraid someone might steal her puppies. At this point, I noticed Sunset had come down, which might explain why Nailao hesitated to eat. Sunset peeked at Nailao's puppies. Nailao stopped eating, panicked, and jumped inside to check on her pups. I reassured her that no one would take her puppies. I was watching over them, so she could eat peacefully, though she still worried about her babies. She loves her puppies deeply, afraid someone might take them, so I ended up bringing her food inside for her. Due to last night's heavy rain, I set up a makeshift shelter with two bags of corn to give her a more private space. After school, Nailao's young owner came to check on her. Her owners do love her but can't be here constantly due to work. A week has passed since Nailao gave birth, and every day she comes punctually to beg for food. She can precisely sense my mealtime and waits patiently beside me for her treats. I found a few pieces of meat in my bowl to give her, but there wasn't much. Once it was gone, I decided to buy her a chicken leg at the store since I didn't have anything else suitable. Even without more food, she still wagged her tail happily, lying at my feet. I had just returned from the supermarket with a bag of chicken legs. I find it odd they limit purchases, even on chicken legs. With one membership card, you can only buy three pounds, so I got ten pounds of chicken breast using three cards. I think this store's policy is redundant--limiting cheap chicken breast, priced at just seven dollars a pound. I noticed that every time I cook for the cats and dogs, it rains. It was sunny earlier, but now it's pouring. It's only 5 PM, yet it's already dark. I chopped the chicken and legs, added dog food, and a bit of chicken broth. After cooling it for half an hour, it'll be ready to feed Nailao. Once prepared, I braved the rain to bring the food to Nailao. It was pouring so hard that my clothes got soaked instantly. This is the new shelter I built for her. I hope she likes it. She knows I brought food and is eagerly waiting. Nailao eats intently, while the little puppies huddle together and play. Because we have so many cats and dogs, my mom wouldn't allow me to keep Nailao in the woodshed. She even offered me three thousand dollars to fence the backyard and create a space for them. But I really don't want to use my parents' money. I haven't relied on them financially since I was sixteen. So, I used bricks to build a small shelter here. It turns out, Nailao isn't a fan of fish; she prefers chicken. So, I used bricks to build a small shelter here. I put it up around one in the morning yesterday. With over sixty cats and dogs, many villagers wonder why I keep so many when I can barely support myself. But I pay for their upkeep myself. I willingly take them in. Seeing them live well brings me peace of mind. I laid three layers of diapers in the shelter for them. Since it's raining now, I can't replace them. It's dirty, but they'll have to put up with it until it clears. After eating, Nailao lies in the nest, and the puppies quickly gather around to nurse. Nailao has done an excellent job nurturing them; each puppy has a plump belly and looks healthy. Three little white puppies and one spotted one are all nursing contentedly in her embrace. After feeding them, I prepared to head back. I covered their shelter to keep the rain out. With everything covered, I headed back to feed my cats and dogs. They were so excited to see me. On the tenth day, I prepared chicken soup for Nailao to nourish her. The soup looked rich. After two hours of cooking, it was finally ready. I set it aside to cool and planned to tidy up her shelter. When I arrived, Nailao was waiting with her tail wagging, even though the ground was dirty. Her shelter hadn't been cleaned for days, so it was a mess. I began my work, cleaning the ground first. Then I moved the puppies into a basin to keep them safe while I cleaned the nest, adding more layers of diapers. After setting up, Nailao came over to check on her pups. I reassured her that no one was taking her babies; I just put them in the basin temporarily. Once the nest was clean, I gently wiped the puppies with a towel while Nailao watched attentively. With everything done, Nailao lay in the nest, and her babies nestled in to nurse. One of the puppies was nursing vigorously at the edge, while Nailao looked exhausted. After they finished nursing, I brought the cooled chicken soup for Nailao. A full bowl of chicken, and she'll eat it all at once. I added some dog food since she needs more nourishment after giving birth. One of my cats smelled the food and couldn't resist climbing onto me, looking for a bite. After feeding the cat a bit, I brought the food to Nailao. She eagerly wagged her tail to greet me. I told her to sit in the nest to eat. She loves the chicken soup, as it's very flavorful. Villagers often feed her scraps, but she doesn't enjoy them, and they pile up and spoil here. Maybe I added too much broth, or perhaps it's too hot. It's been cooling for half an hour, but it's still warm. Since she wouldn't eat it, I hand-fed her the chicken. She still seemed to prefer the broth. She mostly drank the soup without eating much of the meat. I picked up one of the puppies; I think this might be the eldest--it's so chubby. It looks like a little panda with a bit of a grumpy face, almost like a raccoon. This little one is a bit feisty, growling softly and squirming. Its belly is round from nursing, though it doesn't resemble Nailao at all. I asked Nailao, but she didn't seem to care. It truly doesn't resemble her. I better put it back to nurse before it gets upset. Nailao is excellent at caring for her puppies; they're always clean and dry when it's sunny. Day 25: The weather is great today, so I plan to give the little pups a bath. It's been raining for the past few days, and the little ones are quite dirty. Since the weather is nice today, I'll give them a good wipe. Three of the little ones are already in the basin, but the spotted one slipped away. No escaping; today is bath day. I've prepared the water, and to avoid them catching a chill, I heated it up. Now, it's comfortably warm. Starting with the eldest, who is quite the mischievous one. Let's get her clean first, while the other three white pups lie quietly in the basin. Only the spotted one keeps moving around, trying to climb out and play, always so active. I pick her up and wipe her down again. She's a bit naughty, but at least she cooperates during the wash. The eldest has really been fed well--she's round as a ball. Nailao even came over to check on her babies. After cleaning her up, I put her back in the nest and start on the second pup. This white pup was practically turning into a little black pup! Nailao watches me bathe her pups from the side, no longer stopping me from touching them. All of Nailao's puppies are plump, maybe because I've been feeding them nutritious soups daily. This little one is so dirty; I decided to wash her directly in the water. She's so good, doesn't make a sound while I bathe her. She's incredibly cooperative. I love bathing pups like this. Afterward, I quickly towel her dry. This towel is very absorbent, and with today's high temperature, they'll dry quickly. After two hours, I finally cleaned Nailao's nest and wiped the pups down too. They nursed for a bit, and now it seems Nailao wants to leave the nest to play. I change four or five diapers for them daily, and today, I tidied up their area a bit. I told Nailao to stay here and take care of her pups while I prepare them some good food. Every month, I have to buy at least three or four loads of supplies for the cats and dogs. Today, I'm making steak for Nailao. It's been stewing for three hours, so it should be ready. The soup and meat look pretty good. You can't smell it outside, but as soon as you walk in, there's a rich aroma. Two of the pups inside have already smelled it and are crawling around excitedly, but this isn't for them. I'll scoop it out to cool before feeding it to Nailao. It cools too slowly in the pot, so I took it all out. The little ones keep pawing at it, wanting to come out. I've already removed the bones from the steak; it's all meat now. I added the steak to the dog food and soaked it in the broth, then cracked in two eggs, ready to take it to Nailao. The remaining broth will be used for two more batches of chicken breast. I'll mix this up for Nailao and bring it over. As I approached, I called for Nailao several times, but she didn't come to greet me. She must be off playing somewhere. She isn't watching over her pups today, even though she usually guards them. So, I took her pups out to look for her. I told the little pup to call out for her--maybe her mom will show up if she hears it. But instead, the little one just smiled at me. I didn't find Nailao, but I did see two cats I often feed. They've come for food again. I continued carrying the little pup around, calling for Nailao, but she still didn't appear. Since I couldn't find her, I returned the pup to the nest and went back to feed my other pets. When I returned with more food, Nailao was already waiting beside the nest. As soon as I put down the food, Nailao came over to eat, eating in her usual graceful way. Nailao always eats slowly, without any hurry. It's just her personality, I suppose. She's clever, even picking out the meat to eat first. After a while, she came and lay by my feet. I encouraged her to keep eating, but she stayed still--maybe she had eaten elsewhere before coming back. She looked like she wanted to lie down and nap at my feet, but I reminded her to finish her meal. In the past, she would finish an entire plate here, but today she seems less hungry and is eating slowly. After a bit more, she returned to nurse her puppies. Nailao's pups are all round and healthy, especially the spotted one. The spotted one is always the most eager to nurse, and the sound of their nursing is so comforting. One of them, however, is a bit slow, wandering around while others nurse, though this little one isn't skinny either. So I adjusted their positions, making sure all four could nurse comfortably. The spotted pup nursed most vigorously, even making little piggy sounds. I put her back, and she immediately resumed nursing. She's so dominant, always getting the most milk. Nailao just spoils her unconditionally. I'll make sure Nailao eats more so she can keep producing milk for the little ones. Day 32: I prepared food and called for Nailao, but Bittermelon came instead. I let Bittermelon eat first, and all the little ones gathered around. Originally, I intended the food for Bittermelon. Then, Nailao joined in. Thankfully, they don't fight over food. I told Nailao to let Bittermelon eat first. Both were hungry, so I went back and brought another bowl specifically for Nailao. They even competed to see who ate faster. I added extra nutrients to Bittermelon's food because she has a bit of a skin condition. I mixed it in well so she wouldn't notice. Bittermelon eats really quickly. She finished a whole bowl, with about a pound of meat, in just over a minute. Half a pound of dog food and a pound of meat, and Bittermelon was done in no time, even trying to eat from Nailao's bowl afterward. Then she was truly done, and just watched as Nailao ate. The little black dog was drooling, so I'll give her a separate treat later. Our Nailao eats with such grace. Bittermelon was done, yet Nailao still had half a bowl left. Since Nailao is nursing, she needs more good food. The little black dog also usually eats a lot. In the past, they would fight over meals, but now I've trained them not to by withholding food when they fought. This was actually one of Nailao's fastest meals, and I even heard her burp, so she seems satisfied. The black dog got to finish Nailao's leftovers, as she had been eyeing it eagerly. Soon after, I came over to give Nailao her supplements. She's smart enough to know when she's taking medicine. She spit out the first few tablets but ate them properly afterward. These are calcium, iron, zinc, and selenium to help her stay healthy. Since she started nursing, she's been deficient in minerals, so it's okay for her to take a few more. Normally, a dog of her size should take only eight tablets a day. She's already had seven; just one more. I've never seen a dog so well-behaved with medicine. Nailao is truly amazing; just one last tablet to go. Because she's been so cooperative, I decided to reward her with a big chicken leg. The black dog came over, wanting some too. Even Bittermelon behaved and didn't jump in to grab it, so I'll reward her with five chicken legs when we get back--enough for everyone to share. Bittermelon couldn't resist any longer and wanted to eat. I gave her a bit, as well as a taste for Bittermelon. I had intended the food for Nailao's pups, but Dire took it all. She's a little foodie too. I'd just put out two bowls of dog food, and they were gone in a flash. This group really has a big appetite. It's been over a month now, so the pups can start eating some meat and dog food. I tidied up their nest yesterday. After cleaning their nest, I wiped them down, so they look much cleaner now. Tomorrow, I'll deworm them. It's been over a month, and they're ready. Nailao's pups are all very well-behaved. After holding one, I quickly put it back to let her eat. Otherwise, her siblings might finish the food. Nailao doesn't have as much milk for them anymore, as they've grown and have bigger appetites. Recently, I often see the pups chasing Nailao to nurse. Today, as I cleaned up for them, I took them out of the nest. Nailao doesn't want to nurse anymore, so she often avoids the nest, especially as they've started teething. This little one is quite cute after being washed. She isn't pure white, with a coloring similar to Nailao. These four pups quickly finished what was in the bowl. I can't feed them too much at once; they're still young. I only feed them two or three times a day, doing my best. Later, I noticed that the spotted pup still had a piece of meat in her mouth. That's enough; I can't give them more, as it might be hard for them to digest. I'll let Yutu, one of the older dogs, finish it. Dire also came to eat. I told her it was for Yutu, so she waited patiently nearby. After a while, I mixed up some goat milk powder for the pups. This is their first time having milk. To my surprise, they started drinking on their own. Slowly, the other pups joined in. Amazing! Their first time with milk, and they're already drinking on their own. I'm genuinely impressed. This will lighten Nailao's load a bit, so I'll prepare goat milk powder for them daily. All four pups can drink on their own, though they seem a bit unaccustomed since it's their first time. With more practice, they'll grow to enjoy it. If they don't finish the milk, I'll remove it to keep their nest clean. Otherwise, leaving unfinished milk here would make their nest quite messy. Right now, it's pretty tidy. Here's a stray piece of dog food. One pup immediately ate it up, not wasting a bit. Look at this little one's round belly, as plump as a small watermelon. I'll set her down to see if she'll drink any more milk. If she's done, I'll take the milk away to keep the nest dry. Day 56: Recently, Nailao's owners returned, so now they're staying at their own home. Whenever I call Nailao, she wakes up. I tell her to take care of her pups, but two of her puppies were adopted out by her owner. Now, only two little golden retrievers remain. They're adorable and always playing together. They aren't afraid of me at all. Every time I come over, they want to interact with me--they're very familiar with me now. After all, I've been feeding them for over a month. Though they aren't my dogs, they feel like my own. These little ones are still especially fond of me. According to their owner, these two might also be adopted soon. I'm not sure about the details since they're not my dogs, but all four of Nailao's pups have grown beautifully. One of them even sneaks glances at me, wanting to interact. Now, they all have teeth. Each one opens their mouth, trying to nibble on my fingers. They only nibble gently, as if just teething. The two little ones are growing more alike each day. One of them used to have white fur, but now it's turning yellow as it grows. The other one had a hint of golden color from a young age. Now both pups have fur just like their mother's. After playing with them for a while, I went to make them some tasty food. The stock of cat and dog food at home is getting pretty high. I barely have room to cook, so I'm using the pressure cooker to stew some beef in the meantime. Today might be the last meal I prepare for the little ones, so I want it to be special. The beef isn't done yet, so I went to play with the pups for a bit. They can sleep through all kinds of noise, even loud Mahjong games. I walked over to wake her up for the food, but she was sound asleep. I got a little worried and checked her breathing. Thankfully, she's fine--maybe she didn't get enough sleep last night. She sleeps so deeply! Her owner mentioned that someone will come to adopt her soon. Meanwhile, the other pup woke up with a jolt. She seemed startled, as if she heard she's getting adopted and now doesn't dare to sleep. Not long after, Nailao returned, and the little ones rushed over to nurse as soon as they saw her. Seeing them, Nailao quickly ran off; she's no longer interested in nursing them. But whenever I call her, she comes right over. I asked if she feels sad that her puppies will be leaving soon. As soon as the pups saw their mom, they rushed to nurse, making it hard for Nailao to get away. Now she's hesitant to return. She left the little ones here to play. This pup really is quite mischievous. The beef I was cooking is finally done. It's tender enough that they can easily eat it. The aroma is so delicious that even I feel like having a taste. I shredded it into small pieces for them. I mixed in the soaked dog food, and it smells fantastic. I'm sure the pups will love it. Once it was ready, I brought the beef over, but the owner told me that one of the pups had already been adopted. Only one little golden retriever remains now. I thought both of them would be leaving, but the owner's daughter didn't agree. So now only one of Nailao's four puppies is left. The other little golden retriever didn't even get to have the farewell meal I prepared. I hope that little one grows up healthy and happy in her new home. This remaining golden retriever tried to nurse from Nailao again, and when I brought her over, she quickly devoured the meat. She's a bit possessive about food; when feeding her, I need to be careful, or she might bite my hand. Compared to her, our Nailao is much gentler. My hand almost got bitten by this little golden retriever. These dogs are well-trained and polite; they don't jump in to grab food when others are eating, knowing I won't forget them. When I start feeding, they all sit in front of me, looking up expectantly at the food in my hand. If a piece falls, Dire doesn't waste it and immediately eats it up. Egg Yolk always drops pieces as she eats, so I tell her to eat carefully and not make a mess. The little golden retriever eats dog food from the bowl without anyone competing. Meanwhile, Nailao is eyeing the chicken leg in my hand, so I just give it to her. Look at Nailao's pup--her belly is round and full. She eats so much every day. Initially, both pups were supposed to be adopted, but her young owner insisted on keeping this one because she looks like a golden retriever. Otherwise, by the time I finished cooking, she'd be gone. It seems she's here to stay in our village. From now on, I'll prepare tasty meals for her every day. She seems to understand and is behaving so well in my hands. In the evening, I brought some more food for the golden retriever. She was lying down calmly by herself, and as soon as she saw me, she came over. I brought a bowl of snacks. She ate happily, even hiding while she ate, as if afraid someone might take it. This little golden retriever really has a big appetite. After she finished, she went over to nurse from Nailao again. Now she's become an only child. She used to have three siblings, but now she can nurse all by herself. This little one is likely to grow quite plump since she gets all the milk to herself. Nailao isn't keen on nursing her anymore. But the little golden retriever clings to her and finds all kinds of positions to nurse under Nailao, refusing to let go. Nailao doesn't know what to do. I told Nailao not to worry and let her nurse. I fed Nailao chicken breast and quail, and she enjoyed it. This silly puppy is so big yet still nursing. I wonder when she'll finally wean. Poor Nailao seems quite worn out. I tried to pull the little golden retriever away, but she wouldn't budge--she's addicted to nursing. Nailao tried to walk away, but she couldn't shake her off. Finally, the little one let go, and Nailao took the chance to slip away. The golden retriever has eaten a lot today. When I came back, I found her still eating, so I decided to save the food for Nailao instead. Day 64: The little golden retriever eats a lot every day, quite the little foodie. Nailao doesn't compete with her pup for food. She waits until her little one finishes before she eats. The little one eats so quickly. When she's had enough, I save the rest for Nailao. Once her pup steps away, Nailao goes to eat. But when she sees her pup approaching, she moves aside to let her eat first. The golden retriever eats so much, so I give what's left to Nailao. Now, the pup's head is almost bigger than her mother's. While Nailao eats, I hold onto the golden retriever to keep her from taking Nailao's food. Otherwise, Nailao would just let her have it. Day 70: In the morning, after preparing the dogs' food, I brought some over for the golden retriever. I saw Nailao guarding the door, while the golden retriever was sleeping at the staircase. She woke up as soon as she smelled the food. Today, her wake-up speed wasn't as fast as usual, ranking only average among dogs. But she's still quick at eating. Nailao just lay by my feet watching her pup eat without trying to take any food. Maybe she wants a treat too. I'll get something tasty for Nailao later. Meanwhile, the little one rolls around at my feet. I urged Nailao to go eat from the bowl, but she wouldn't compete with her pup. Even when I nudged her toward the bowl, she came back. Clearly, she wants to eat, but Nailao won't fight her pup for food. She's truly a wonderful mother. I told Nailao to eat, and then I'll bring a bowl for the golden retriever. But she just stayed at my feet. Finally, I moved the bowl over to Nailao, and she began eating. But as soon as the pup came over, she walked away. I think Nailao really wants to eat, but this must be what they call a mother's love. I hope the little golden retriever grows up healthy and happy by Nailao's side, always joyful.
