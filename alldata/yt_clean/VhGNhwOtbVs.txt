To distract yourself, write Another time, look rather Is that you? Are you opening? It's bad manners to leave people What happened? A guy who had Scobie? I left him hanging I have a stinging remedy! That's just like you. What's that? This will hurt you more than it will me. I'm sure it will! Did you hear that? I only went in to find out... Never mind! It will prevent you but not from lying! Does it hurt? Are you kidding? In a western movie you would bite Are you really Do you want my passport? Is that all you found? Do you want to see my tattoo? We'll get there!

We want the money and we want it fast! Shut up! You're scaring the kid. He doesn't have the money and neither does she. Then who? I don't know. I don't know. Or you! Didn't you find anything better? - Listen to this guy... Let's suppose that one of you by chance? That he followed him, got stuck in the train... And that he took the money, He wouldn't have been stupid enough If he had run away... it would be a confession of guilt. He had to stay and pretend until we decided Bullshit! They have the money! Let's search their rooms! All right! So, let's not waste time! And we'll search yours. Not mine! Do you have something to hide? No objection? Here is my key. My room is open. Make yourself at home.

We stole the big cake... but I didn't see a rattan. What if we were off the mark? What do you mean? What if he's right and it's That would be pretty gross! I'd tell you if I had it. Of course I would! And so would I. Of course! Herman too! Of course! We didn't hurt him. If you had a treasure, In the garden. He doesn't have a garden. I don't either. In this room, Up there! On the cupboard? You're right. I hope I don't find any There's something there. I found it! Are you crazy? We won! We found it! Is it true? How: no? It's up there. There's nothing there! Herman's spare hand. Where is he? In my room. Take the kid away... Who could have made I don't know. This is not my room. Nor mine. The Police won't like it. We could transport him He's not that bad.
