Avdiivka Coke Plant: War on GoPro &quot;Britva&quot; to &quot;Fedya&quot;. &quot;Britva&quot; to &quot;Fedya&quot;. Starting to move. Come on. Go. Godspeed. FPV. Damn. There's no entry to Avdos (Avdiivka) anymore. - And no exit. - There was the only (transport) artery left and now they (russians) have fucking blocked it too. Like, it's still possible to make a run for the plant, but damn... You can't drive into Avdos anymore. Fuck. Our boys are there. - No. It fucking hit the plant there. Fuck. I asked to bring a backpack over. Men, do you have a backpack of some sort? Let's roll, &quot;Dos&quot;. Turn the EW on. It's just, damn... The faggots fly (drones) at such frequencies that the EWs don't always help. Oh, fuck. Whoa. They pressing... That's coming for our souls. &quot;Grads!&quot; &quot;Grad&quot;. You alright? Move! Move, brother! We're under dense shelling! Moving! That was cool! How are you, bro? We've slipped through. I told you that I'm lucky, damn it. So, what. I think we need to place it there somewhere. The railway goes there. And, like, it will monitor this area, the middle part here, and it will cover the railway over there. Move. Come here. Look at this shit. *Writing on the box*: &quot;Recipient. Belgorod city. &quot;ExportTechProm.&quot; Belgorod city. - Belgorod. Look at these... These are some kind of components. The blades. KAB. &quot;Grads&quot;, brother. Damn, they're fucking firing &quot;Grads&quot; at us and we're fucking snapping pics on a bicycle! It's falling down, brother. Bitch. Fucking look at this. Scumbags. Phosphorus is flying. Yes. Straight at us, damn it. Those weren't &quot;Grads&quot; last time. It's phosphorus. The boys are on the move. Fucking suck off with your phosphorus. What, dude. Let's get moving? Alright. Let's roll. It's fucking crazy what this will be like when we'll be coming out here. This all will be fucking boiling here. By the way, there may be gasoline here. But, hardly... Not anymore. How delicious it is at times. We have to get to those columns. Shit. A drone is fucking buzzing somewhere. We now need to take shelter somewhere. &quot;Berkut&quot;. &quot;Berkut&quot; to &quot;Fenya&quot;. The blue gates over there. There. You need to go through those. Wait. The code word. Plus. Alright. Keep going. I'm going to meet them. What fucking pipes these are! Me and &quot;Marik&quot; have all clear here. Fuck. How damn good it is outside! Yes. Right. I'm fucking fed up with that basement already. - Fuck it. You have to fucking sit in there like a damn mouse, not seeing the God's world. I don't even know how many days we have been here, damn it. Three or four? - The fourth, it seems. Fucking faggot, bitch! There somewhere. Yes. Let's get out. Bitch. Hit fucking hard. Come on, &quot;Mara&quot;. Let's get fucking moving out of here. Avdos. Honestly I'm so fucking tired. We still have to sit here all day. Such a bullshit like this. *Joking* Rolling the fuck away from here on the bicycles with &quot;Marik&quot;. Fuck it. I'm fucking going AWOL. &quot;Marik&quot;, let's fucking roll AWOL. We've come up with a new method of electronic warfare systems against FPVs. While there is no shift, &quot;Marik&quot; and I haul coal part-time. What is there to do? We've got to survive somehow. There are not enough workers. They say there are shellings here. Everyone fucking fled for some reason. He's actually carrying it on the bicycle. Fucking crazy. If you're watching this video, then we're alive. &quot;Artist&quot;, say hi. Attaboy. Bro. There's probably no point in going there together. No. Get in here. Damn, it's all torn down here! Holy fucking shit! I'm taking aim at a reference point. Now put the ? on the legs. Prepare a box of ammo! Here, &quot;Fes&quot;. Damn. This is a fine position. - It was. Mine's away. Observe. The faggots are blasting. Such a bullshit it is, kids. Fucking insane, huh? Aviation. Run! We're leaving, right? &quot;Kubik&quot;, &quot;Bes&quot;! &quot;Kubik&quot;, &quot;Bes&quot; here? - &quot;Kubik&quot; and &quot;Bes&quot; are here! My rifle's in the back there! Watch it! Alright, let's go! - Let's go! Most importantly, hold tight. Or we'll all fucking fall out now. Unload. Unload. Head first. Here, to me. Come on. Holding. Holding. Brother. Bro. Hold on now. Don't press on his legs! - Don't push! Don't move! - A little bit higher! Come on! A little higher, dear. - Alright. Attaboy! - Bro. Hang in there, kid. I'm with you. - Hold on, brother. We're here. It's alright. &quot;Vitos&quot;. &quot;Vitos&quot;. I'm with you, brother. I'm &quot;Sherkhan&quot;. I'm here. - Brother, keep talking. Keep talking. Don't even think about saying goodbye! - I'll beat the shit out of you in the hospital when I get there! I promise. That's good, &quot;Vitos&quot;. - Look at him, saying goodbye! - It's going to be damn fine. - A little bit more. They're adjusting fire! Take &quot;Vitos&quot;! Take him from that side! - Faster! Grab! Grab! Pull! Pull, lads! Pace up! Pace up! Pace up! Two people KIA! All in? - No. All in? - All! All! All! Easy. Easy. Easy. Take her. Any immobile WIAs? - No. - Alright. How many of you were there? - Eleven! - Plus! Unload your rifles! - Unload rifles! Guys, let some of you get in our car! There're too many of you here. Come on. One person goes there. One person. You're fine. Get in the front seat. Come on. Done! Done? Should I close it? - Yes! How are you, &quot;Masya&quot;? Easy. Sit down here. Here. Holding. It's water. Just water. - Just water. Hold on, little one. - Everything is fine. - You've already passed the worst. I have no contact with headquarters. - I'm on my way in the medevac now. Don't know. We're going to the stabilization point. I don't know what kind of stabpoint that is. There is no one to ask yet. Stabpoint of the Third SABr. - Stabpoint of the Third SABr. I'll let you know when I arrive there. Potholes! It's done. Tigers, damn it. Did our job. Got the fuck out. - We're alive. With so fucking minimal... Right, &quot;Sosna&quot;? Fucking write the history together with the Third Assault Brigade. Write the history together with the Third Assault Brigade! Come on, baby. Come on. You can do this. So, the boys are slowly moving on. - With a heater on! - With a heater on. Without a windshield, though. But with a heater on. Right, Fedechka? - Fucking good. - All clear. Everything's fine. We'll arrive there. Say hi! - Did enough fighting, damn it! - I've kicked their asses! Warriors! Warriors! Who are we, warriors? We're SABr, fuck it! Third SABr!
