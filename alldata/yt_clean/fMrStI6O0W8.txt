FOR NEXT YEAR. FORECAST AND MAKE A DOT NEXT HOW DO YOU BEGIN TO DO THAT? THE FED HAS BEEN SILENT ABOUT NOTHING ABOUT THE ELECTION AND TO THE EXTENT THINGS GET PRICED FOR THE FED TO IGNORE THEM. CERTAIN EXPECTATION, HOW DO YOU FORECAST? FED STAFF PUT A BIG FISCAL 2017. WHEN POWELL SAYS WE DON'T SPECULATE, WE DON'T GUESS, IF SOMETHING IS HIGHLY LIKELY THE IN TERMS OF THEIR THINKING.

THE MARKET CLOSED AT AN EQUITY FUTURES A DOWN BY .1% STREAK ON THE S&amp;P 500, .7 PERCENT. A BLOWOUT MONTH OF NOVEMBER FOR A TON OF ECONOMIC DATA, ANOTHER GDP, JOBLESS CLAIMS AND CORE CAN THAT PUT A DAMPER ON SOME FEEL? BUT IF PCE COMES IN HOTTER AND MARKET EXPECTATIONS FOR THE FED.

MULTIPLES WERE 27 TIMES FOR BIG THIS YEAR AT THE PEAK WAS 34 NOW WE ARE TRADING AT 30 TIMES. EXPRESSING THE EXPECTATION WANT TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO SURE YOU COULD DELIVER THAT IN THE GOOD NEWS IS, THEY ARE PARK AND DELIVERING MORE THAN JUST TO BUILD ON THIS AND SORRY ABOUT AI AND BIG TECH BUT IT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, ARE WE PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THE AI TO THE LIKES OF PC'S AND HP GET THE UPGRADE CYCLE? INTO THE REST OF THE COMPLEX TO THERE IS THE BIG TECH HIS NEXT YEAR WHERE THE YEAR ABSOLUTELY. EARNINGS FRONT IT IS VERY CLEAR MODERATING, THE PACE OF SLOWER THAN EXPECTED. THE SECOND POINT ON 19% IN GROWTH, 33% IS, WANTING PEOPLE IN THE MULTIPLE LINKS TO THE QUESTION THAT YOU AND YOU NEED TO SEE IMPROVEMENT THERE ARE CERTAIN APPLICATIONS IT HAS PROMISE. EDUCATION. I THINK AS WE KEEP HEADING FORWARD, INCREASINGLY THE FOCUS AND ALL OF THE HYPE, WHERE ARE SO A HEADLINE THAT WAS NOT AI, FROM 66 6 26666. ARE UP ON FINANCIALS? LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS THAT CAN WAYS THAT THEY CAN'T WITH OR HEALTH CAREFULLY? VENU: I THINK IT IS MAYBE THERE ARE I DON'T HAVE TANGIBLE EXAMPLES SHORING UP.

THERE IS ONGOING THEY ARE THAT ONE OF THE FEW TELLING US THAT DEMAND HAS SKEPTICAL. DEMAND IS ELASTIC. YOU ARE SEEING THE CONCERN WE ARE NEGATIVE ON COMMODITIES, ON ENERGY, WHY? VENU: THE OIL MARKET HAS SHOVED OIL IS STILL RELATIVELY THE BIG STORY FOR ENERGY, LAST ABOUT THE RETURN OF CAPITAL AND RIGHT NOW THE EARNINGS MOMENTUM THE COMMODITY IS NOT GOING UP. ESPECIALLY OUTSIDE THE U.S.. ENERGY IS NOT THE HARDEST PLACE TO BE EVEN THOUGH THEY AND THE ROAD TO PUMP UP OIL. WANT TO PUMP MORE? LISA: THAT IS WHAT THE EXXON CEO SAID HAPPEN.

VENU: CONFESS THAT IT IS EXTREMELY SAYING IS IT POSTURING OR A HOW SERIOUS ARE YOU? SO FIRST WE FIGURED OUT WHAT WE SAID FORGET ABOUT ANYTHING THE POLICIES, WE USED MACRO COMPANIES DON'T TELL YOU WHAT WE USE MACRO DATA AND WE IN THE WORLD RETALIATES, THE IF YOU HAVE 50% OF THAT, IT HIGH BUT NOT BAD. CAPTURE IS THE SECONDARY AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR ECONOMISTS BELIEVE THAT IF SCENARIO TARIFFS, INFLATION U.S. REAL GDP WILL DECLINE 1.4%. IMPACTED, YOUR, 0.7% IF I THAT IS PRETTY SERIOUS.

YOU HAVE BEEN OUT FRONT ON THIS ABOUT IT. 18 AND COME UP WITH A NEW PROJECTIONS, WHAT WILL PROSPECT OF A POLICY CHANGE IN INCOMING INFORMATION HAS GONE WHAT THEY HAVE EXPECTED? IT IS THE LACK OF EVOLUTION OF FED'S EXPECTATION THAT 2% LEVEL ON A SUSTAINABLE BASIS WE ARE JUST NOT THERE YET. PRICE PRESSURES. PERSPECTIVES AND DOT REVISE HIGHER THEIR RATES. TERMINAL RATE. MATERIALLY ADVISED BY 25 OR 50 THE OUTLOOK FOR ADDITIONAL RATE PREMISE THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING AND NOT FORECAST OF THE MORE PRONOUNCED SUSTAINED BASIS. LISA: WHERE IS THE INFLATION COMING POINT TO HEAR WE ARE NOT SEEING HOUSING PRICES, THIS WAS MET WHERE IS IT COMING FROM? WE STILL ARE SEEING PRESSURE LARGEST COMPONENTS, NOT JUST AT CPI AT 40%. ANNUAL BASIS. TRACTION FROM THE LONG-STANDING INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR THE BACK IN THE RANGE OF 2% TARGET. PRESSURE ON WAGES. COME DOWN FROM EARLIER PEAK SITTING AROUND THE 4% MARK FOR TO ADD THE STATIONARY FLOOR TO DESPERATELY TRYING TO BREAK PERIOD OF PRICE STABILITY, THE LISA: REAL SHIFT OVER THE PAST COUPLE HOLE WHEN JAY POWELL WAS WELCOME ANY DOWNWARD MOMENTUM FROM ANY FURTHER WEAKNESS. MINUTES, SOME JUDGE DOWNSIDE THE LABOR MARKET HAD DIMINISHED. WHERE INFLATION READINGS ARE SOME WAYS THAN EVEN THE I THINK THEY ARE STILL VERY THE RISK FACTOR OF THAT POINTS. THE LABOR MARKET SHOWING DIMINISHED AS YOU MENTIONED IN THE MEETING MINUTES, THEY DATA BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THE AGAINST THIS POLICY PIVOT COME FROM.

VERGE OF A PAUSE AT THE FEDERAL &gt;&gt; I DO. OUT OF THE FED IN DECEMBER AND OF 75 BASIS POINTS OUT OF THE SO WELL ABOVE WHERE THE MARKET LISA: FOCUSING ON INFLATION BECAUSE SOME OF THE POLICIES THAT THE TALKING ABOUT PRESIDENT-ELECT CONGRESS, HOW MUCH WOULD WE SEE LINDSEY WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT BASIS POINTS FOR CUT SEEMS TO IF YOU LOOK AT LONG-TERM FIVE-YEAR INFLATION FORWARDS, PUTS THE ELECTION. POLICIES, EVERYONE IS FOCUSED HAVE AN ENERGY POLICY WHICH MAY BUT AT THE SAME POINT, WHAT WE U.S. ENERGY RENAISSANCE, IT CAP THEN WAS LOWER THAN IT IF YOU THROW IN THE PRICE WHICH IF THE PRESIDENT DOES THE 2024, WE SHOULD EXPECT A LOWER WHICH IS ALSO GOOD FOR GROWTH I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE HOLISTICALLY RATHER THAN KIND OF BEHAVIOR OF LONG-TERM SENSE. LISA: BALANCE SHEET AND COMPOSITION INTO IT BECAUSE IT IS THE DAY PRICE OF COFFEE IS GOING UP QUESTION OF WHETHER THE DRIVER A BOND YIELDS NEXT YEAR EXPECTATIONS. FED BALANCE SHEET WITH SECRETARY WHO HAS TALKED ABOUT TOTAL TREASURY PROFILE. DREW: MY GUESS IS THE TREASURY WILL OPTION SIZES AND MIGRATION, BUT UNTIL VERY RECENTLY HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WANT TO PORTFOLIO. SIZE OF THE BALANCE SHEET, THE MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES AND THAT WILL BE HAPPENING PROBABLY FED ACTUALLY BEGINS TO BUY U.S. REACHED WHERE THEY WANT ON THE TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW MBS TO U.S. TREASURIES. DYNAMIC FOR MAY DEMAND TREASURIES COMING FROM THE U.S. WE WILL HAVE TO SEE HOW OTHER HAPPENS WITH OTHER USERS OF THE U.S. ADDED PRESSURE FROM KIND OF THE END AND PROBABLY REVERSE ITSELF.
