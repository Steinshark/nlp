If you ever find yourself in Seattle, near as King County Airport, there is a nondescript But you really ought to know where to find and the door is hidden at the back. Yes, you guessed it, it's a telco exchange Museum. Here, you can tell this is the Empire of Telephone: [Marc] Hi Peter, I'm Marc. [Peter] Welcome! [Peter] Telephones everywhere! [Marc] Whoa! [Marc] So this used to be an actual interchange, [Peter] Still is, an actual telephone company [Marc] Oh, I recognize crossbars, this guy Oh, I recognize a ringing machine, because [Peter] Because you've watched Sarah's video [Marc] Yes, they have a YouTube channel, linked one that invited me for the visit. She'll join us later. And yep, that's where you can learn everything in the museum. [Marc]Well I thought a ringing machine with thing from the 1930s, right? [Peter] Right. They came in different sizes depending on of subscribers. So there's a smaller one there. [Marc] Oh that's an itsy bitty one. This is my hand for comparison. This predates electronics, so they had no So they had to get a strong signal from the [Peter] Yeah. [Marc] And it's fairly high voltage too. All the wiring at the back. Relays galore. [Peter] So 1938 design, 1948 design. [Marc] 1938 on the left over here. [Peter] That is the test desk, as they called The blinkenlights, this is this is the blinkenlights. [Marc] This stuff lives hidden. This has been my whole career, I'm a telecom And I can never explain to people what I do, But it's an immense amount of technology. [Marc] That's how all meters should be. [Peter] So, this is the power panel, originally Everything of course runs on 48 volts DC. [Marc] Ah yeah, so you can back it up with [Peter] You can back it up with batteries. Do you know what this is? [Marc] It's a fuse. [Peter] It's a fuse, yes (actually this might Do you see what the rating on that fuse is? [Marc] It's 4,800 amps. [Peter] 4,800 amps, yes. [Marc] I know, because you have all those [Peter] Right! [Marc] And then rows and rows of stuff. Oh, it's alive, blinkenlights! [Peter] This is the television broadcast transmission [Peter] It's more Teletypes. [Marc] Yeah, you can never have enough Teletypes. Oh, a reperforator! Model 15. Oh model 19, right there. And which is that? It's a model 28? [Pete] This is the 28, yep. [Marc] And the model 35. Whoa, you have one of each! So this place is overwhelming, there are several I'll try to give you an organized tour starting up to the Bell Labs early computerized stuff, see it for yourself. [Marc] So we'll start with the beginning here, What does a crank do? [Colin] So this is how you get the operator's [Marc] And it operates a little electricity a hundred volts - so, quite a bit - to the Go for it Colin. There you go! So the 100 volts went over there, and alerted So now, Pete is going to be our operator. Go for it Colin. [Peter] So I see that 65 wants to make a call. I take my cord and plug it in at 65. [Marc] So, that has the incoming... Oh, no no no, 65 is going to be the jack where Then it goes into the machine. [Peter] Right. So now it comes in here. And now I can speak to my subscriber, and [Colin] Uh, number 14. [Peter] Connecting you now, Sir. So now, I take the front cord, these cords And I plug it in at 14. And now I have my own crank and magneto to And I have to pull this switch towards me [Marc] It's the phone right behind you, okay. [Peter] And now 14 Rings. [Marc] Okay. [Peter] And, I then pick up. Hello Colin, how are you? [Colin] Hello! [Marc] All right. So you have a phone, and that's basically machine, straight. Two wires to two wires. [Peter] Two wires to two wires, yep. [Marc] The circuit is powered by the calling So, Colin, you have something in here. You have the batteries. So everybody has to get their batteries ready, [Peter] They have to send somebody around the batteries in everybody's telephones. [Marc] Therefore the first big step for central [Peter] Right. What they called common battery. [Marc] Right, and that's when they switched [Peter] That is when they switched to the [Marc] And actually, these two explain the This one is a local battery, and this one [Peter] It's a common battery board, yep. [Marc] And you were telling me that one of that it had power. And therefore they could go away from the [Peter] Instead of the little flaps dropping And the jack is conveniently located right the operator to see which jack they need to [Marc] That's progress! [Marc] And, Colin, what what is this bigger [Colin] So, this is a toll board. So this is for handling not local customers, distant cities. All the jacks here, instead of going to individual this city. And so this is how the operator would connect to connect your long-distance call. [Marc] The local calling, we'll see it in [Colin] Right. The earliest dial systems only handled calls [Marc] Right. And toll, that's synonymous for: now you have [Colin] Right. [Marc] ... when you do long distance. And that is a bigger and more difficult problem. [Colin] Right. [Marc] And it stayed manual for a long long [Colin] Right. They didn't implement customer-dialed long And so, up until then, even if you could dial a distant city. So you would either ask the operator, or dial They would have a headset to talk to you... [Marc] Right. [Colin] ...ask what number you wanted to call. [Marc] Right. [Colin] And then, they would ask the route So it's another operator involved. And then they would connect you to whatever the city you wanted to talk to. [Marc] I had not realized that the long distance [Colin] Right. It's a more complicated problem. [Marc] Now Peter, you are going to show us is done automatically, thanks to this. [Peter] So, instead of having to speak to starting in about 1898. [Marc] Oh, that early! And that just creates pulses, right? One pulse for one, two pulses for two... [Peter] One pulse for one, two pulses for [Marc] All right. And then you got to decode it thanks to this Well I have to take a step back, this is huge! [Peter] This is the thing that an undertaker invented in 1892. Each pulse that comes in from the telephone And each of those pulses then causes the solenoid [Marc] Get counted. And then the contacts are made down on this [Peter] Yes. [Marc] And that also can rotate. [Peter] Okay, it goes up, and then around [Marc] All right. So that's two degrees of freedom. (Phone ringing) There you go! [Peter] Hello? [Marc] So this whole bank of things can handle [Colin] About 200 subscribers. [Colin] So all of those subscribers, this connected into the line finder. [Marc] This is are all the phone lines that This is just amazing wiring. So that's pretty impressive, but you tell [Peter] The problem with this system is that As you get to have a hundred thousand customers, just not economically feasible anymore. So they needed a solution to that problem. [Marc] Okay, let's go see it. All right! [Peter] And now we come to the way Western 1923. [Marc] And what do you call this? [Peter] This is called a panel switch. [Marc] So Sarah is here. The switch witch! [Sarah] Yes! [Marc] You're the specialist of this system. And I understand it's fairly rare? [Sarah] Yeah. Based on all of the research I've done, this [Marc] I'm trying to focus on the contacts They're in this huge matrix of little contacts. [Sarah] Yeah, they're arranged in these large And each bank, there are 100 sets of contacts [Marc] It's amazing! Can you move one of the little brushes that They are on rods? [Sarah] Each brush has to stop within a fraction [Marc] They are actuated from down there? [Sarah] Yeah. They're controlled by these segments down These are actually clutches. And if I operate a clutch, I can force the So the motors are always running, the rollers And when we want to move a brush, all we have drive, and we can move the brush wherever At the top of each of these rods on this frame... [Marc] I can't get to it! [Sarah] ...way up, top bank there. [Marc] Yeah, this one. [Sarah] These are called commutators. As the rod is traveling upwards, these springs And they move over these commutators. And as they do, they send pulses back to the It's called the sender. The sender counts the pulses, and when it for, it pulls the power and instructs the [Marc] So there's some digital computing involved [Sarah] Exactly. [Marc] So here we're going to move from our computing part of it. Ta-da! [Sarah] So in telephone parlance this is called computer, designed at the same time in the And the job of this sender is to monitor and it. Once it has received a certain number of digits, which is all the way over there. That database returns values to the sender. And then it uses those values to direct the build the mechanical connection for that call. [Marc] So, it's one big step ahead of the [Sarah] Yes. [Marc] It has registers, it remembers your to move, it subtracts them from the pulses So it's a little ALU in there. Amazing! Let's make it work! [Sarah] All right, let's do it! [Sarah] The magic button! [Marc] Oh man, this is the mother of all panels. [Sarah] So these are calls that are going They're actually going to progress this way. So one call takes a bunch of frames to set [Marc] Well, I missed that, when these started Oh, there we go! It's the Matrix! And then during that time, the relays... Is that one in use? Yes it is! [Sarah] Yeah. [Marc] It's clicking like crazy. So what's this big thing doing, Sarah? [Sarah] So this is all test equipment. All of these jacks are the the lines that town. They all appear as jacks here. [Marc] So those are trunks? [Sarah] These are trunks, exactly. And if someone reports a problem, that their what trunk they were using, plug into it. And then I have a voltmeter circuit here. [Marc] Oh yeah, nice one! [Sarah] So I can do voltage tests, I could And I can make sure that the electrical characteristics If they're not I would just fill out a ticket The other cool thing I can do is, I can place So by using these keys... [Marc] Oh, you can dial something. It looks like you should be able to control [Sarah] Yeah, basically. In the original days of this switch, you'd all times. [Marc] Really? [Sarah] Just testing and monitoring. [Marc] And making sure to the hunking machine A hunking machine it is. So we are leaving our amazing panel to go be crossbar. [Sarah] Yeah. [Marc] So crossbar is another wonder of technology. [Sarah] So, this is called a number five crossbar. It wasn't the first crossbar, but it's a really So, on the crossbar system, you have a bunch These are individual magnets here. And then you have 10 horizontal levels, that So what I'm going to do, is I'm going to connect two magnets. So if I want to do that, I've just connected [Marc] And it stays connected by some kind [Sarah] And as long as this vertical magnet So the select magnet can be released, but connection up, for as long as it's operated. And what's happening here is, these select sticking out of them into that crossbar switch And that wire can go either up, or down. And when that wire goes up or down, it interferes And when that vertical comes in to close the then causes these contacts in here to actually But if you look at these contacts right here, And I go horizontal, sorry, horizontal and You can see them closing in there. [Marc] Yes, we see it . I mean, the genius of that thing is, it's [Sarah] Exactly. [Marc] You can have any or all of the contacts All the positions are valid, you don't have They are all available to you at all times. [Sarah] Right. And the control element of this - called a the state of the entire switching network And then make a decision about how to route And if the first route is not available, it [Marc] And also very scalable, because it's Actually they made memories out of that for scalable. And if you have seen my video about the Japanese the devices they used to make their 23,000 Yep, this computer's RAM is this made out [Sarah] The hardest part about it, is connecting But if you want to make this bigger, you can [Marc] So, very scalable. [Sarah] It's very very scalable. [Marc] I hear the noise, but I don't see anything. [Sarah] Look up here. You'll see it eventually. [Marc] Yeah. It's also much faster than the panel, because As in the other machine, this one is also [Sarah] It's even better. One of the ways they did that is with this a physical record, whenever this machine encounters So, I can simulate that for you. All right, so look here. [Marc] Okay, I'm looking! Oh! [Sarah] It's a punched card. And the holes in the card are sort of a stack And then, we can take these cards, and by [Marc] ...figure out what the problem is. [Sarah] Yep! [Marc] Little holes! Little punched card! Well it's not little, it's a big punch card. [Sarah] Big punch card! [Marc] OK we'll have to skip over other call timer clock, and the automated call billing age, with the 3ESS computerized switch, courtesy [Marc] So now we're doing a giant leap in six? [Colin] 1976. [Marc] 1976. And it has been computerized. And this is? [Colin] Number 3ESS. [Marc] Yes, 3ESS. So when I went at Bell Labs, I came to the a big deal. [Colin] So we're just gonna apply 48 volts [Marc] Oh, 48 volts of course. Oh, I've heard I heard relays. [Colin] Right. All the relays work, and now there's a bunch we have to turn on. [Marc] Okay, go for it. (fans start to whirr) [Colin] And these are various peripherals once it starts to come to life. And we'll turn on this computer. Need to turn the switch is in the back. I'm going to turn on the the other computer. So this is a redundant pair of computers. It's going to take several minutes for it But you can see, it's sort of progress indication [Marc] I was asking if it was typical 1970's And the answer is yes, and no. There's some stuff that looks like it would Heydays of Bell Labs, right, when they could You can also see why Linux (UNIX) came out that was A) secure and B) would work 24 hours It didn't need to reboot, it could recover [Peter] Although this system is not running hassle they had with doing that, was one of okay, we need to have an operating system machines, but also a development platform [Marc] So it's truly, the switch computers [Peter] Absolutely. [Marc] What would be the terminal that would [Colin] A teletype. [Peter] This guy right here. [Marc] Oh, an ASR 33? [Colin] A 35 is what the original would use. And ours is in storage and we have not made [Marc] Yeah, the 35 would be the much more [Peter] It's up! [Sarah] It's running! [Marc] That's it? [Peter] That's it! [Marc] I hear a click click. It's the seconds? [Colin] Yep. [Marc] Oh yeah. Oh, and it's telling it to you very very slowly [Peter] 110 bauds, exactly.. [Marc] It's crying out loud for a mechanical How many of those are still around? [Peter] These machines? [Marc] Yeah. [Peter] Zero! [Marc] All gone? [Peter] This is this like our panel. We're pretty sure this is the only preserved [Marc] Wow. [Sarah] So you don't end a line with the enter You end a line with bang. And then it just tells you right away, Print Which means it's working, and it will eventually [Marc] Very terse. [Sarah] Very, very terse, again because, teletype. [Marc] Teletype, right. Yeah, you can't can be chatty on a teletype. [Colin] Okay diagnostics of the CU complete, [Marc] You have to do your short hand pretty [Colin] Yeah, yeah, you do. Aha! And now we get, this is the normal light! [Sarah] It's working! [Marc] You got it? [Colin] That's what we like to see. [Marc] Oh, very nice! [Colin] So now, we should be in a position So we do... There we go. [Marc] All right! !e have it, go for it Peter. [Peter] Hello? [Colin] Hello! [Peter] Uh yes, I think Marc is here. Let me see if I can get him for you. [Colin] Thank you. [Marc] (laughter) We used this small machine Amazing! So next time you use a computer, take a minute their invention of the transistor, and Unix And don't forget, if you are in Seattle for you to visit. See you in the next episode!
