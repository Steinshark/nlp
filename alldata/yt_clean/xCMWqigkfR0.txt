Everything is okay from a technical point of view. Weather is good too. NOTAMs was not something that would limit us in any way. Minimum Sector (MSA) we have 2700 ft. The rest out of the box. Goes straight out DP541 or 900 ft whichever is later. speed 210 kt, then DP542 also speed 210 kt. PENEM, GIGUB and ORTAG. Initial climb FL70 is set, transition (altitude) we have 5000 ft. Wait a minute, I have PENEM directly after ODLUN. PENEM, GIGUB, ORTAG. Oh ORTAG4E, yes ok, you're right, everything's fine. Alright? Yes, wrong line here. No problem. We mentioned Initial Climb 7000, 5000 Transition, NAV RAD I don't have anything or Autotune now. And we addressed Notes 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, the 210 kt... If unable to comply... That's not a problem today and the others don't really concern us either. OK. And when advised by Tower contact Munich 126,175 is on the Stby window. Questions regarding this? No, it fits. Emergency Briefing: Before 80 kt we stop for any malfunction. Hello, I'll give you this briefly so that you can check it. It takes a few minutes. No problem, thank you. Let's finish the briefing quickly. Before 80 kt we stop for any malfunction. Between 80 kt and V1 only fire, Fire Warning, Engine Failure, Predictive Windshear Warning or Aircraft is unsafe to fly. In all cases I call stop, close thrust lever, disconnect Autothrottle, max Reverse. You check whether the speed brakes extend and the auto brakes work. Then only the 60 kt call comes from you. We stop, set Parking Brake and then PA twice "Remain seated" because there are passengers with us. Then let's take a look at everything. If memory items are on the floor, I do them without confirmation. Do you still look so that I don't do anything stupid? And if we have to evacuate, we have the stick checklist, we work through it and then get out. After V1 continue, positive rate, gear up, EOSID execute. It should be DP448 straight ahead, it is known. I'll enter this on the FIX page. 200 ft autopilot, 400 ft identify the failure. Then please do the memory items on my command with confirmation. Then today we accelerate to 2000 ft, we climb to 3000 ft, then we are save. Non-normal checklist, normal checklist and then we come back to Leipzig, that's it. Weight-wise it's not a problem ... If it's really time-critical with Smoke, Fire, Fume, if we have anything, then we'll give ourselves vectors for the downwind and then we'll come back. Threats and Risks, if I hadn't seen any from my side, you still have something. We'll have to look after all the stuff in case of a rejected takeoff but I think it's doable. Any questions? Nope. Then that would be completed. Then I would give you some numbers. Leipzig Frankfurt (BOX)912 (D_AA)LG. ACM 3 that fits too. We have a zero fuel weight of 199.9 t. Difference to planned 900 kg more. Takeoff crossweight 213.9 t It's exactly right, that fits. The last container goes in, thank you. The landing weight is 208.5 t. Max zero fuel weight is 30.8 t and takeoff is also 30.8 t. Then I'll give you one to look over, for you. There are minimal lithium batteries included , which are on 11P below. That's 0.2 kg, so not so tragic today. 31, 42, 44, 5, 2 with 58, give me... 80-5... can the power go? External power can go off. Yes please Flaps 5 are confirmed. thank you.

We have a minimum sector altitude of 4300 ft, where we fly through. The whole thing starts DF437, DF439, FL90 or above, DF444. Then it goes to the Base DF454 and then extended Centerline. This is DF452, 5000 ft or above. The approach itself goes out of NODOG at 5000 ft. Inbound track 067, 3 degrees descent. At DME 4.2 we have a check altitude of 1630 ft. And then we go down to the minimum, Baro 520 ft, which is set on both sides, right? When we land, the runway is 2,8 km 45 m wide, the PAPI is on the left.

Diverten, Alternate Leipzig, where the weather is suitable as well. We have 8.2 t, 900 kg. Approximately 7 minutes of leeway to fly around there. There was nothing in the recall. And in the notes there are none checked The go around maneuver is: One of us called "Go Around" I press the TOGA buttons, both thrust levers forward, 15deg degree pitch, flaps 20 And then 1500 ft above ground, This corresponds to approximately 1800 ft, clean up the aircraft and then we carry out the missed approach procedure. All right. I don't have any threats and risks on my part, do you have any? Not so far at first. I forgot NAV RAD.

But that's not because of the spotting, but because of the dog, I think. But the fire brigade is already ready. They recently did fire exercises. They stood there. There really was a huge plume of smoke, deep black. They were really messing around here. So, first on the left, exactly. There really isn't much going on here today. Nothing at all. Lufthansa is on strike, right? Oh yeah, that's right, there was something there. I was already thinking at the hotel that I would fly to Vienna this evening and then arrive again tomorrow morning, but... not today. There are a few AUA flights to Vienna but they are all hopelessly overbooked because of course everyone is opting for them. So if it stays that way, I would consider not driving into the city. to eat. Yes, that is quite risky. Yes, no, I'm not in the mood for that.

It was also probably very expensive. Have you ever noticed in Shanghai in the hotel, all those giveaways that used to be cosmetic items are now all chargeable. Ok, I don't go to Shanghai that often to be honest. I rarely do it lately. I shorten things a bit. So you have to shell out money for shower shampoo, right? No, if you want toothbrushes or something.
