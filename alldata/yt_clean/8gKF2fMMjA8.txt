Watch until the end of this video, we'll If you want to get your own copy of NetSim, In this lab we will configure EtherChannel All of the connections between these switches However, because of spanning tree protocol The inactive link will act as a backup, which be forwarding at the same time, to increase We will configure Layer 2 etherchannels between layer switches, and then we will configure layer switches. Let's get started with step 1. I'll go on ASW1 first. ENABLE. And frst let's check the spanning-tree situation. SHOW SPANNING-TREE. So, G0/1, connec ted to DSW1, is the root It won't forward or receive any frames, If we configure this connection with DSW1 two interfaces here, they will be replaced be the new root port, and will forward traffic So, let's do that. Enter global config mode. CONF T. Let's configure both interfaces INTERFACE RANGE G0/1 to 2. To configure etherchannel, use the channel-group CHANNEL-GROUP 1 MODE, now which options do Step 1 instructs us to use LACP, so we can If we use passive mode, we have to ensure EtherChannel won't form. But let's just go with active on both sides. ACTIVE. Okay, we're also instructed to configure it as To do so, let's configure the port-channel INTERFACE PO1. SWITCHPORT MODE TRUNK. Okay, so because DSW1's port-channel isn't SHOW INTERFACES TRUNK, but let's just check DO SHOW RUN. So, you can see that the port-channel 1 interface and G0/2, you can see that the SWITCHPORT was also applied to them. Let's also check the status of the EtherChannel, show in the lecture video. DO SHOW ETHERCHANNEL SUMMARY. So, the port-channel interface itself is SD, Now look at the member ports. They have the flag 'I'. What does that mean? It means stand-alone. So, they are configured to be part of an etherchannel, as stand-alone, individual ports. Why is that? It's because we haven't configured DSW1 So, next up let's configure DSW1's side. ENABLE. CONF T. The configuration will be the same INTERFACE RANGE G1/0/3 to 4. CHANNEL-GROUP 1 MODE ACTIVE. Passive would work as well here, since ASW1's Now let's configure the port-channel as INTERFACE PO1. SWITCHPORT MODE TRUNK. As you can see, this model of switch supports we have to set the encapsulation first. SWITCHPORT TRUNK ENCAPSULATION DOT1Q. SWITCHPORT MODE TRUNK. Okay, now the EtherChannel should be up. Let's check. DO SHOW ETHERCHANNEL SUMMARY. The port-channel interface has the flags SU, These are the flags we want to see. For the member ports, the flag is P, meaning This is also what we want to see. Let's check the trunk interfaces. DO SHOW INTERFACE TRUNK. Okay, port-channel 1 properly became a trunk. Before configuring the next EtherChannel, of SHOW SPANNING-TREE is different. DO SHOW SPANNING-TREE. As I said, we no longer see G0/1 and G0/2 port. F0/1 and 2 are designated because they are Next up is the EtherChannel between ASW2 and The configurations will be almost identical active mode we'll use desirable, which is Remember, PAgP has desirable and auto modes, So I'll quickly run through the configurations, ENABLE. CONF T. INTERFACE RANGE G0/1 to 2. CHANNEL-GROUP 1 MODE, now here is the only DESIRABLE. So, the port-channel interface was created, now let's INTERFACE PO1. SWITCHPORT MODE TRUNK. That's ASW2's side, next up DSW2. ENABLE. CONF T. INTERFACE RANGE G1/0/3 to 4. CHANNEL-GROUP 1 MODE DESIRABLE. Next up, make the port-channel a trunk. INTERFACE PO1. This is the same model of switch as DSW1, SWITCHPORT TRUNK ENCAPSULATION DOT1Q. SWITCHPORT MODE TRUNK. Okay, let's check if it's up. DO SHOW ETHERCHANNEL SUMMARY. Here are the flags we want to see, SU for Next up let's configure the Layer 3 port-channel We're already on DSW2, so let's start INTERFACE RANGE G1/0/1 to 2. So, first you should make these routed ports Now when you make the channel-group, the port-channel We already used channel-group 1 for the connections 2. CHANNEL-GROUP 2 MODE ON. I used ON, because the instructions say to Now all we have to do is configure an IP address INTERFACE PO2. IP ADDRESS 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.252. Okay, that's it. Let's do the same on DSW1. INTERFACE RANGE G1/0/1 to 2. NO SWITCHPORT. CHANNEL-GROUP 2 MODE ON. INTERFACE PO2. IP ADDRESS 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.252. Okay let's take a look at the status. DO SHOW ETHERCHANNEL SUMMARY. Notice that the flags are now RU, meaning once again display P, which is what we want Let's try a ping to DSW2's port-channel DO PING 10.0.0.2. Okay, looks good. Next up we are supposed to configure static So, let's check the current routing table. DO SHOW IP ROUTE. There is no routing table, why is that? Well, for a multilayer switch to build a routing DSW1 was able to ping DSW2 because it's ip routing, even if we configure static routes, table. So let's enable IP routing and configure EXIT. IP ROUTING. Now let's check the table. DO SHOW IP ROUTE. So, these routes we already have for the VLAN1 2 interface we just configured. Let's configure a static route to SRV1's IP ROUTE 172.16.2.0 255.255.255.0, and the Let's check DO SHOW IP ROUTE. Okay, it was added to the table. Next I'll do the same on DSW2. EXIT. IP ROUTING. And I'll configure a route to the PCs' IP ROUTE 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0, and the Let's check the table. DO SHOW IP ROUTE. Okay, looks like we have all of the routes So, let's try a ping from PC1 to SRV1. PC1's default gateway is the SVI on DSW1, 3 port-channel to DSW2, which will forward So, let's try the ping. PING 172.16.2.1. So, I've said this a few times before, but a few timeouts, this is because the ARP process all go through, like this. Okay next up we are asked to check the default each switch. The access switches are the same model, and model too, so I'll just check ASW1 and DSW1. ASW1 first. To check the load-balancing method, DO SHOW ETHERCHANNEL LOAD-BALANCE. So, the default is source MAC address. All frames from the same source MAC address of the EtherChannel. While we're on ASW1, I'll do step 6 as IP address. EXIT. Okay, the show command uses 'etherchannel', we use this command: PORT-CHANNEL LOAD-BALANCE Let's check again. DO SHOW ETHERCHANNEL LOAD-BALANCE. Okay, it has been changed. I'll go on ASW2 and do the same now. EXIT. PORT-CHANNEL LOAD-BALANCE SRC-DST-IP. And let's confirm. DO SHOW ETHERCHANNEL LOAD-BALANCE. Okay, looks good. Finally let's check the load-balancing method DO SHOW ETHERCHANNEL LOAD-BALANCE. Okay, the default on this model is the same So let's change it. PORT-CHANNEL LOAD-BALANCE SRC-DST-IP. And confirm once more. DO SHOW ETHERCHANNEL LOAD-BALANCE. Okay, it was changed. Now I'll hop back on to DSW2 and do the PORT-CHANNEL LOAD-BALANCE SRC-DST-IP. And then confirm. DO SHOW ETHERHCHANNEL LOAD-BALANCE. Looks good. So, in today's lab we configured Layer 2 and static EtherChannel. We also configured the EtherChannel load-balancing IP addresses to determine which interface was the source MAC address only. That's all for this lab. Next let's take a look at a lab in Boson Okay, for today's Boson NetSim lab preview, There are 3 labs about EtherChannel in NetSim This one here, EtherChannel Negotiation Protocols: Let's do Layer 2 EtherChannel. Click on lab instructions, and this is the So, you can see there are many opportunities All of these switches have redundant links These are the commands you need to know. You do know all of these commands already, I'll show you that in a minute. And here are the tasks. There are three main tasks. Task 1, plan EtherChannel configurations, Task 2, review initial configurations, with And then task 3, verify configurations. So, for this preview we'll just do task 1. So, we won't actually do any configurations, we're that you implement in task 2. So, this task involves planning Layer 2 EtherChannel You will be creating a port-channel between Step 1, determine the number of links that group between DSW1 and DSW2. Okay so, looks like two links, 5 and 6. Now, what are the actual interface IDs of Let's check. So I will show you that SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS ENABLE. SHOW CDP NEIGHBORS. So, CDP is Cisco Discovery Protocol. It's a Cisco proprietary protocol that is devices. So, when I enter this command here on DSW1 of these switches it's connected to. There we go. So, DSW2 is here. And notice under Local Interface it shows So, those are these two interfaces here. And also here under Port ID, these are the So, FastEthernet5 on DSW1 is connected to FastEthernet6 on DSW1 is connected to FastEthernet6 Okay, so that's step 1. Next, step 2. Verify the line and protocol states of each This is referring to those two end columns SHOW IP INTERFACE BRIEF. Here, Status and Protocol. So, they are up and up, no problems. Observe the trunk state of each port. Okay, SHOW INTERFACES TRUNK. So, FastEthernet5 and 6 are both 'desirable'. They are using ISL. Interesting, not dot1q. But they are trunking. Looks like all VLANs are allowed. Default...only VLAN 1 exists by default. And, yeah, looks generally default except Because it's desirable, it's using DTP, so negotiated to be ISL. Let's check that out on DSW2 also. SHOW INTERFACES TRUNK. Same, it is also using ISL for FastEthernet5 Okay, switchports configured to be a member same way in order for the port-channel to Verify that the interfaces are configured Okay I'll go back to DSW1. Let's just check SHOW RUNNING-CONFIG. Okay, there is no configuration on FastEthernet5 How about DSW2? SHOW RUNNING-CONFIG. Same here, so that should be no problem. Okay, step 5, what command can you issue to port-channel group? That is this command, I'm not actually going command. CHANNEL-GROUP 1 MODE, and then either active PAgP, or on for static EtherChannel. Okay, observe spanning-tree output for VLAN Okay, let's do that first on DSW1. SHOW SPANNING-TREE. I think only VLAN 1 exists, so we could just anyway. Oh, so DSW1 looks like it is the root port All interfaces have a designated role. And it says that here, 'this bridge is the How about DSW2? Okay first, spanning-tree quiz. Which of DSW2's ports will be the root port? FastEthernet 5 or 6? So, they both have the same root cost, 19, a cost of 19. The neighboring switch ID is the same, they're So the last tie-breaker is the neighboring So that is FastEthernet5 here. So, I think DSW2's FastEthernet5 should be Let's see if I am correct. SHOW SPANNING-TREE VLAN 1. And I was correct, there we go. Okay, next, 7. In this lab, how much bandwidth is available So, it's FastEthernet, so it should be 200 SHOW INTERFACE F0/5, has here...that is 100,000 So that's 100 megabits. And FastEthernet0/6 should be the same. Yeah, 100,000 kilobits. Okay, so when you combine those two together, have a bandwidth of 200,000 kilobits, 200 Okay, so that was step 7. Step 8, why is the full amount of bandwidth and 6? Why is that? Well, that's because FastEthernet6 is blocking How does EtherChannel increase the amount between DSW1 and DSW2? Because it combines them to form a single I just showed you that in the lecture video. So, number 10, how many switchports can be group? So, up to 8 can be active at any one time, but only up to 8 will be active and then the ready to take over if one of the active ports Okay, so there's task 1. Just take a quick look at task 2, what kind Determine the number of links that can be Here we go, configure the interfaces as members Verify that an active trunk link exists on Verify the correct amount of bandwidth. As I said, 200 megabits per second is available And then finally, verify your EtherChannel So, if you ever have any trouble you can check As you can see it is quite lengthy and detailed, It's another great study resource. Even if you don't have any trouble, I recommend lab. Okay, and you can also grade the lab by clicking Now, I of course didn't finish the lab, so in the lab. But if you check the device configurations If you put in some extra commands that you And it grades the lab for you. So, I think Boson NetSim for CCNA is a great It's got a huge catalogue of in-depth labs test your knowledge.
