I just gotta make sure it is the chicken. Yum. There's actually a backstory to this. A couple years ago, when Cheesecake Factory had this recipe, I wanted to make it at home. The time I discovered making this was when I used to live in my house before I got married. This just brings back nostalgia. Maybe this is your gift, actually.

Oh, you'll grow into it. Oh, is this your gift? And also, I feel like these shoes are kind of big. Wait, this is a size seven. I'm six and a half. Who would make that? Uh what? Because the shoe size is wrong. The only person who wouldn't know that would be Alan, because he's been so far away from me for so long. Well, I don't know. You still got one more gift. Maybe, honey, maybe. Okay, now the biggest gift of them all. Okay. All right. Yeah. Go. 321. What is this? Wait. No way. He would have known that that's you.

You already know I have all the rappers merch. Why would you not pick? How would I know that? Because I wear it, like, almost every day. You won the first round, you lost the second. So now it's one-one. And the last round will define everything. Okay, so now it's time for the moment of truth. Okay, guys, so the game is very simple. Asala is going to be sitting on this side of the curtain, while on the other side, we're going to have six Alan 1234. This is Alan. Mila's going to be here. And I'm going to be number six, if she's going to be able to find him. And this mic is going to distort audio, so you guys will hear us Put your headphones on. What do you think is going to happen? I actually don't know. I'm scared to get him out. Honey, I think you're going to find him. No problem. I literally left him when he was I still think you're going to find Okay, guys, we're good. And I'm going to be number six. I'm going to try to make her think it's me. I know a lot about Alan, and I know a lot about asylum, so let's see. -Okay. Ready? Okay, first question for contestant number one. I want to know what annoys you the most. People chewing with their mouth open. Okay, he did tell me last time I was eating Okay, so I'll keep contestant number one at maybe. Okay, contestant number two, are you ready? Yes. The thing that annoys me the People yelling at you? Yes. I don't know, knowing my brother, I would say that wouldn't be the most thing that annoys him because my mom yells at him all the time. So I don't know. I'm gonna go with my gut and say not Alan. Contestant number three, what annoys you the most? Whenever you and you specifically sing too much, like, your voice gets raspy and then you keep It gets on my nerves. Him saying my voice is raspy. That is not a fact. But the fact that you mentioned me singing, Okay. I'm going to say maybe. I don't know if I'm doing a good job, guys. Okay, contestant number four. When you burp a lot. I don't burp a lot. Okay. No, that is not alan. I'm sorry. This is a quick one first. So contestant number four, I'm going I just have to think about my actions. Contestant number five, When I'm hungry. What that's like such a teenager instant. I'll kick it up. Maybe. Okay. Okay, number six, last contestant. What annoys you? When I'm trying to sleep in, I hate when people try to wake me up. Okay, so for those who don't know, alan's been visiting me his whole state. I really haven't waken him up, like maybe once or twice and he never takes me to care. So I think this was an easy one for me. I'm going to say contestant number six, Okay, honey. Okay, honey, this is the time for elimination. So after every question, you're This is your time. Wait, what does it mean if I eliminate my brother? Am I a bad sister? All I know is maybe out of the three right here, the most confident I was was number six was not out.

Are you 100% positive? Yeah. Okay. You could open your eyes then. What? Okay, well, anyways, Okay, honey, put it back on. I can't believe I got you out first. That's crazy, dude. Okay, so second question. I'm going to warm it up a little bit. Ready? contestant number one. I want to know what's your favorite food? My favorite food is mexican food. Yo, remember when I ordered mexican food No, this is definitely not Alan. Keep in mind, you could eliminate right away You're going to take the risk. So we let him go. Are you sure? Okay, contestant number one, come on in. I knew it. You have four left out of six. Like, aren't you seeing the bond? Like, you're remembering things that you didn't even know about him, and now you're moving forward. You're connecting. You're connecting. Okay, question number three. Are you ready? Okay, this one's gonna be a little bit more personal. Contestant number two. Who is your favorite celebrity or artist? Drake. Remember, he's always playing it in the car. I'm gonna say I think that's maybe Alen. Okay, that was a pretty good okay, Who is your favorite celebrity or artist? Ice spice. Did you say Ice Spice?

My favorite artist would be Drake. Oh, my god. Honey, remember, we're gonna have to eliminate one person at the end of this, so think about it. For the sake of it. Contestant number five, who is Lees Eilish. Did he say Billie Eilish? No. Okay. I think contestant number because I know he likes boy music more. He wouldn't say billie eilish. So you're taking out number 500%. Okay, contestant number five, you are eliminated. So you can come. Okay, open your eyes. I literally forgot that she was part of this. So now number five is out. So now you have three more. One of them is alan. I really think this is showing you a lot like, you knew a lot of things you thought you didn't know. Okay, so the next question is going to tell me a lot about what is your biggest fear? Contestant number two, I would have to say sharks. I actually think he would be scared of sharks. Okay. You want to keep him? Yeah. Okay, test at number three. What is your biggest fear? I'm afraid of being alone and everybody leaving me. Nobody will want to play with me. And then I'll just have to turn off my monitor at one point and face reality. Wake you up. That's not alan. That's not hell. He if anything, he tells me, get out of my room. Close the door. He wants to be alone. I'm just gonna put number three as not alan for now. Okay. I want to hear what contestant number four has to say. What is your biggest fear? All right, my biggest fear is going to be heights. So pretty much if you stick me over 6ft over any building, you'll see my legs shivering. So, yeah, my fear is heights. Wait, we're giving away a lot of cool stuff. All you have to do is subscribe to the channel and comment. Done. And we will send you the gift wherever you are around the world. Okay.

Love you, honey. Guys, she better get it right. I'm going to have a talk with her today. Okay, honey, moment of truth. So the next question is what do you miss the most about us living each time you come home? That I would steal your food. Okay. I do remember Alan used to come in my room and try to take the snacks that I have hidden. But I feel like he's also very emotional, so if I ask him a memory of his favorite time with me, it wouldn't be that. Okay, so you're sure you want to eliminate? Before I do, I want to see what number four has to say. Okay, contestant number four. What do you miss most about us living together? My favorite part is when you sit in light in the house with energy and positivity and you succeed all around the house and you just make us have really great vibes. And what I miss the most about you is your presence. And I love you, Allah. Are you sure? Are you sure? Why? Michael. Number four, you could show yourself. Okay. Wait. Easy. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Okay. One, two and three. Go ram. How does this game always end up like this? Now are you convinced? Okay, turn the camera. Are you convinced now? I think we're just so close. And I totally forgot that being far, no matter how far no matter how far we are, I still know who she is. And she still knows who I am. I love you guys so much. Okay, I'm going to go cry now.
