ANNOUNCER: THIS PROGRAM BY THE FRIENDS AND PARTNERS JOYCE: CAN I TELL YOU, THERE THAT GOD IS NOT INTERESTED IN THAT GOD IS NOT THERE? [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: YOU'RE NEVER ALONE. [MUSIC] JOYCE: IT AMAZES ME, AT HOW MUCH IS IN JUST BUT IF WE JUST READ THROUGH IT, A LOT OF WHAT'S THERE. AND SO TODAY, I WANT TO SHARE OF JOHN CHAPTER 21. IN JOHN CHAPTER 21, THERE ARE JUST IN THAT ONE CHAPTER I WON'T STAND HERE AND PROMISE BECAUSE I KNOW I AM, BUT WE'LL ALL RIGHT, &quot;AFTER THIS, JESUS LET HIMSELF AGAIN TO THE DISCIPLES, AND HE DID IT IN THIS WAY.&quot; A PICTURE OF THIS. &quot;THERE WERE TOGETHER CALLED THE TWIN, AND NATHANAEL AND THE SONS OF ZEBEDEE, OF HIS DISCIPLES.&quot; IN A GROUP, I GUESS, KINDA DO, LIKE WE DO SOME DAYS. &quot;AND SIMON PETER SAID TO THEM, EXCLAMATION MARK. NOW, THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT OF THE EXCLAMATION MARK SO, HE MUST HAVE SAID IT AND I DON'T KNOW THIS FOR SURE, AND SOME OF THE DISCIPLES WERE FRUSTRATED, YOU KNOW, JESUS AND WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN AND HE'S GONE NOW. AND I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE THEY AND DO SOMETHING AND THEY AND NOTHING'S HAPPENING. AND SO, PETER WAS A FISHERMAN NOW IT KIND OF SEEMS LIKE HE'S AND DO WHAT HE USED TO DO. YOU KNOW, YOU GOTTA BE CAREFUL HASN'T SHOWN UP IN YOUR LIFE DON'T DECIDE TO JUST GO BACK [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: AMEN? NOW SEE, THE LESSON THERE WOULDN'T HAVE SLOWED DOWN SECOND THING HERE IS, 'AND WE'RE COMING WITH YOU!'&quot; WELL, I LIKE THAT TOO. DO YOU KNOW THAT A LEADER HAVE--THERE'S A CERTAIN GIFT AND, YOU KNOW, BUT IT'S DOUBLY BAD WHEN YOU AND SO, IT'S JUST INTERESTING WITHOUT EVEN REALLY TELLING PEOPLE WILL FOLLOW THEM. YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST STARTED AT THAT TIME, MY HAIR WAS IT PULLED BACK ON THE SIDE I'D PULL IT BACK WITH COMBS ON THEM. AND I NEVER TOLD ANYONE TO DO ALL THE WOMEN IN THE CHURCH WITH THEIR HAIR PULLED BACK. SO, YOU NEED TO REALIZE IF YOU BETTER BE LEADING PEOPLE NOW YOU'RE NOT ONLY RESPONSIBLE BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE RESPONSIBLE THAT YOU LEAD AND GUIDE THEM DO. SAME WAY WITH PARENTING. YOUR KIDS ARE GONNA DO A LOT THAN WHAT YOU TELL THEM TO DO, SEE WHAT WE'RE LEARNING ALREADY? NOW, SO THEY WENT OUT AND THEY AND HERE COMES THE NEXT MESSAGE, THEY CAUGHT NOTHING.&quot; JUST JUMP UP AND MAKE YOUR OWN &quot;OOH, NOTHING ELSE HAS HAPPENED, &quot;YEAH, WE'RE GONNA COME AND GUESS WHAT, SOME OF YOU HAVEN'T CAUGHT [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: AND YOU GOD'S NOT BLESSING YOUR PLAN. COME ON NOW, GOD HIS PLAN IS ALREADY BLESSED. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: COME ON, MAYBE MAKE A SLIGHT TURN AND THINGS NOW, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT A THREE-DAY PRAYER MEETING OR NOT. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: I MEAN, WE ALL DO TO DO, BUT THERE IS A PRINCIPLE AND THAT IS THAT THE BIBLE SAYS &quot;IN ALL YOUR WAYS, SO, I JUST THINK IT'S GOOD THIS IS WHAT I HAVE PLANNED PLANNED IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT, ME AND GIVE ME THE GRACE TO GO WANT ME TO GO IN,&quot; AMEN? JAMES 4:13 SAYS, &quot;COME NOW, WE WILL GO INTO SUCH AND SUCH AND CARRY ON OUR BUSINESS YET YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TOMORROW. WHAT IS THE NATURE OF YOUR LIFE? YOU ARE [REALLY] BUT A WISP DOESN'T MAKE YOU FEEL &quot;A PUFF OF SMOKE, A MIST.&quot; THIS SCRIPTURE, I WILL BRING INTO THE PULPIT WITH ME AND JUST WATCH IT FLOAT OFF AND JUST SAY, [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: I MEAN, IN LIGHT HAVE HERE AND OUR IMPORTANCE SO, IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE NOT HE ASSIGNS GREAT IMPORTANCE A POINT HERE. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT IN CHARGE. YOU'RE NOT AS IMPORTANT AS YOU YOU'RE NOT AS SMART AS YOU THINK MAKING ALL YOUR PLANS TO BLESS THEM, AND SAYING THIS. &quot;YOU OUGHT INSTEAD TO SAY--&quot; IS WILLING, WE SHALL DO BUT AS IT IS YOU BOAST [FALSELY] AND YOUR SELF-CONCEIT. AND ALL SUCH BOASTING IS WRONG.&quot; THEIR PLAN DIDN'T WORK THEY CAUGHT NOTHING. VERSE 4, &quot;MORNING WAS ALREADY TO THE BEACH AND STOOD THERE. HOWEVER, THE DISCIPLES DID NOT WOW, HOW COULD JESUS BE THAT IT'S JESUS? BUT IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. YOU KNOW, WHAT WE NEED TO-- OVERLY RELIGIOUS HERE, NEED TO USE THE WORD &quot;LUCK.&quot; NO, GOD GAVE YOU FAVOR BUT LUCK IS FOR THE WORLD, &quot;WELL, WASN'T THAT NICE NO, I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE GOD WITH OUR EVERY STEP. AND, YOU KNOW, THIS WASN'T WERE STANDING RIGHT WITH JESUS YOU'D THINK THAT THOSE MEN WHO PRESENCE DAY IN AND DAY OUT SO, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT TIME THAT YOU'RE DOING PLEASE DON'T LET ME MISS IT.&quot; THAT GOD DOES IN MY LIFE BECAUSE MAKES EVERY DAY OF OUR LIFE IS CONCERNED WITH EVERY LITTLE CAN I TELL YOU THERE IS NOTHING, IS NOT INTERESTED IN THAT GOD IS NOT THERE? [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: YOU'RE NEVER ALONE. I'M ACTUALLY PREPARING A MESSAGE INTO: &quot;YOU'RE NEVER ALONE.&quot; THAT IMPRESSED ME. A CERTAIN PREACHER IN HIS LIFE, JUST A PHENOMENAL SAID TO HIM TOWARD THE END HAVE YOU ACCOMPLISHED HE SAID, &quot;WELL, YOU HAVE ISN'T THAT GOOD? THERE'S TWO OF US. WE'RE NOT ALONE, NOW, VERSE 5 IS &quot;SO JESUS SAID TO THEM, ANY MEAT, ANY (FISH)? [HAVE YOU CAUGHT ANYTHING TO EAT IN OTHER WORDS, HE'S NOT CALLING HE'S CALLING THEM BOYS, THAT IT'S OBVIOUS THEY'RE STILL THEY'RE STILL JUST JUMPING COME ON, IS ANYBODY GETTING [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: AND SO, I JUST LOVE JESUS IS SAYING, [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: I TRIED FOR YEARS HIM BE WHAT I WANTED HIM TO BE. AND FINALLY ONE DAY--HONESTLY LOVED SPORTS. WELL, I NEVER GREW UP MY DAD DIDN'T LIKE SPORTS WHAT HE DIDN'T LIKE, AND SO, I DIDN'T HAVE ANY LOVE AND SO BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE IT, NOW, I KNOW HAVE THAT PROBLEM, BUT I DID. I DIDN'T LIKE IT AND SO, HE PLAYED GOLF. HE WATCHED FOOTBALL. HE WATCHED BASEBALL. HE WATCHED BASKETBALL. HE GOT INTO TENNIS. HE GOT INTO BOWLING. ANYTHING THAT ROLLED OR BOUNCED, [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: AMEN? AND SO, I KEEP TRYING TO GET HIM THIS, NOT TO LIKE THIS. AND ONE DAY HE WAS WATCHING TO A BASEBALL GAME, AND SHINING AT THE SAME TIME AFTER MANY YEARS OF MISERY, WHAT I'M DOING IS NOT WORKING.&quot; [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: SO, MAYBE I COULD IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING WORKING? MAYBE SOME OF YOU NEED TO JUST [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: COME ON, I THINK THAT WOULD BE MAKE AND LOVING IT.&quot; [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: IN OTHER WORDS, COULD EVER GET TO THE POINT DID NOT HAVE THE ABILITY EVERYBODY IN THE UNIVERSE MY GOODNESS, I WONDER WHAT JUST GET THROUGH ONE DAY WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS DOING. &quot;'BOYS (CHILDREN), 'NO!'&quot; &quot;AND HE SAID TO THEM, ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BOAT.'&quot; YOU NEED TO CAST YOUR NET 'CAUSE YOU'VE BEEN FISHING AND NOT CATCHING ANYTHING. ACTUALLY, THE TITLE OF THIS WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?&quot; IN FRUSTRATION LIKE, &quot;WELL, TO DO AND NOTHING'S WORKING. GOD, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?&quot; SINCERE QUESTION LIKE, &quot;GOD, [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: I CAN SAY IT AGAIN GOD, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: YOU KNOW, OF SOMETHING, IF I JUST STOP I'M FEELING REALLY FRUSTRATED, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?&quot; &quot;JUST LEAVE IT ALONE. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN JUST LET ME TAKE CARE OF THIS.&quot; IN OUR LIVES THAT GOD WANTS UNLESS WE LET 'EM GO. &quot;CAST YOUR CARE ON THE LORD FIRST, WE HAVE TO STOP TRYING THAT WE TRUST GOD TO DO IT. SO, &quot;HE SAID TO THEM--&quot; VERSE 6, ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BOAT SO THEY CAST THEIR NET, TO HAUL IT IN BECAUSE IT WAS I LOVE THAT. HOW MANY OF YOU WOULD LOVE TO YOUR DRIVEWAY AND JUST DUMP RIGHT AT YOUR FRONT DOOR? [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: AMEN? &quot;THEN THE DISCIPLE WHOM JESUS 'IT IS THE LORD!'&quot; WHEN HE SAW THE MIRACLE-- HE BELIEVED IT WAS GOD. BUT, YOU KNOW, JESUS TOLD THOMAS UNLESS YOU SHOW ME YOUR SIDES IN YOUR SIDE AND YOUR HAND,&quot; WHICH I LOVE ABOUT HIM. HE WILL MEET US WHERE WE'RE AT. AND SO, HE SHOWED HIM SO THOMAS &quot;BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO BELIEVE [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: HEY, IT'S EASY IF YOU'VE RECEIVED YOUR HEALING. IT'S EASY TO GET UP IF YOU'VE HAD YOUR MIRACLE, BUT DON'T FORGET ABOUT WHAT STILL GETTING THAT TESTIMONY [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: 'CAUSE THE ONLY WAY THROUGH A TEST, AND LIKE WE SAID JESUS JUST AS MUCH WHEN THINGS THEM TO AS WE DO WHEN THEY ARE. AND I BELIEVE WITH ALL GOD IN THE HARD TIMES, YOU WILL AND I KNOW PEOPLE THINK IT ACTUALLY DOES BECAUSE WE ARE WE'VE GOT A NEED THAN WE ARE SO, IF YOU LOVE HIM JUST AS MUCH ON THE MOUNTAINTOP, IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND KEEP SEE, YOU--MAYBE YOU'VE GOT AND YOU'VE HAD YOUR HAUL WELL, JUST A COUPLE THINGS TO HAVE COMPASSION ON THOSE [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: AND DON'T FORGET JUST NOW, THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU EVERY SINGLE MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE WHEN HE SAID, &quot;APART FROM ME, HE MEANT IT, AMEN? &quot;THEN THE DISCIPLE WHOM JESUS AND BOY, YOU KNOW, JOHN WROTE CONSTANTLY CALLED HIMSELF, &quot;I AM NOW, I'M ENOUGH LIKE PETER ON PETER. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: &quot;I'M THE DISCIPLE IT'S LIKE...BLAH. WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: WHAT CONFIDENCE MORE THAN ANY OF THE OTHER ON NOT HIS LOVE FOR JESUS, AND HE OUTLIVED THEM ALL, AMEN? [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: THAT'S ANOTHER &quot;THEN THE DISCIPLE WHOM JESUS 'IT IS THE LORD!' SAY THAT IT WAS THE LORD, GARMENT (HIS FISHERMAN'S COAT)-- AND SPRANG INTO THE SEA. AND THE OTHER DISCIPLES CAME WERE NOT FAR FROM SHORE, DRAGGING THIS NET FULL OF FISH. WELL, WHEN THEY GOT OUT ON LAND A FIRE OF COALS THERE AND THERE WAS BREAD.&quot; ANOTHER AMAZING LESSON. &quot;AND JESUS SAID TO THEM, THAT YOU HAVE JUST CAUGHT.' AND HE HAULED THE NET TO LAND, 153 OF THEM--&quot; I LOOKED ALL OVER THE PLACE FOR THAT 153. THE ONLY THING THAT I FOUND, IS TRUE, IS SOMEBODY SAID THAT OF FISH AT THE TIME, AND PART WAS ONE FISH OF EACH SPECIES. BUT I THINK THIS, I THINK, THOSE FISH WERE COUNTED AND IT JUST TO SHOW US TO EVERY LITTLE DETAIL [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: I'VE BEEN READING WELL, LET ME REPHRASE. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO READ [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: AND I MEAN, THE DETAIL OF THE TABERNACLE, THE DETAIL I MEAN, JUST EVERYTHING WAS BUT THEN YOU GET ALL THE WAY AND THE BIBLE SAYS THAT HE ON OUR HEAD. NOW, I KNOW FOR SOME PEOPLE AS IT IS FOR OTHERS BUT-- [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: AMEN? JUST THINK ABOUT THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE THINK. YOU KNOW, GOD IS JUST NOT THE GREAT THING ABOUT BEING A COMPANION, A FRIEND. THERE'S NO LONGER ONE OF YOU, LAST NIGHT WE HAD A FAIRLY LARGE AND I PRAY THAT SAME THING DON'T WANNA GO OUT OF HERE YOUR OWN THING AND SPEND [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: IT'S SO MUCH BETTER AND JUST ADMIT THAT RUNNING YOUR LIFE AND ASK JESUS ASK HIM TO COME IN AND CONTROL AND THEN I LOVE THIS, VERSE 13, TIME I SEE THIS. &quot;AND JESUS CAME AND TOOK AND ALSO THE FISH.&quot; JESUS COOKED THEM BREAKFAST. WHAT? THE RESURRECTED LORD, THE KEYS OF HELL AND DEATH AWAY GRAVE VICTORIOUS, TOOK HIS BLOOD CAME BACK DURING THE 50 DAYS, THE RESURRECTED, THE LORD OF LORDS, [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: AND HE COOKED THEM WHAT AN EXAMPLE.
