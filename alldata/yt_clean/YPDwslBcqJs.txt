to take a closer look at the ribbon let me know in the comments down below oh this could be a sneak peek at what's to come what's trending we've got all of the candy colored ribbon which I don't know if I've seen that before the pinks again I will be doing a video on what's trending for Christmas 2024 you guys seem to like that last year so I'll be doing it again this year but like I said this is a sneak peek of what we have at Hobby Lobby for Christmas 2024 and just Christmas 2024 in general so let's see oh this is pretty with the little berries we've got the snowflakes here and some Bells yeah so I'm just I'm really taking a look like what is trending definitely a lot of Grinchy colors for sure they're just starting to put out the pics so we have these Berry picks here these are are $6.99 they've got all different kinds of berry picks we've got darker colored ones over here here we've got some poinsettas you guys can see they're just starting to put it all out oh white poinsettas could that be a trend we see for 2024 we've got some silver glittery picks over here again I think they're just putting them out oh the Frosted Berry ones those are $1.99 I love those we've got oh look at these down here you guys we got these really pretty pine cone ones they're like flocked pine cones ooh I like that a lot those are $6.99 got some pine cones down there oh they're right up here

these little white berries down here and these are gorgeous the like frozen look or frosted look and these are oh only 99 Cents for those more over here I don't know what these are supposed to be let me know in the comments down below if you know $3.99 for those some Pine piics over here this gold is really pretty we got some Pine over here more gold lots of different pine picks which I feel like I don't usually see those and what is this guys these holly leaves these are $3.99 and they're frosted lots of frosted you guys seeing tons of frosted and then again here there's lots of different pine but oh I'm seeing some grin gry colors lots of griny colors you guys these are $1.99 and then I see blueberries not like blueberries but like blue berries and it's a very vibrant blue $1.99 for that so already I have a few guesses on what's going to be trending for Christmas 2024 cannot wait to put that video together for you guys that will probably be in September so be on the lookout for that but let's keep looking around and seeing what Hobby Lobby has so far we've got these really cute Santa Claus I think they're ornaments these are $8.99 and they've got all the glitter those are so pretty then over here we've got some candles we've got red and white here we're seeing like we saw in Fall these are they Yaks is that what they are you guys these are $1 13.99 for these and they have some purple and pink candles it's with the Christmas stuff so purple and pink is not going to be on trend for Christmas 2024 they have these little trees that they always have these are $5.99 they have more of the Yaks and the trees there and again just the pinks and purples wondering if that's going to be trending candles we've got $9.99 for these lanterns here more candles and then more of the little flock trees with the burlap bags at the bottom here they have lighted Pine and this is what they look like that's what they're showing so let me know in the comments down below what you'd use that for I've never seen that before pretty interesting they have a whole bunch of them here again it's this is the beginning of them putting out the Christmas stuff and like I said this is a little preview of what's to come I'll be back probably in a couple weeks to see what else they have $50.99 for that wreath this one here is $23.99 they have these little flocked wreaths over here these are $5.99 again here we are with those pink and purple candles in the Christmas section they have white candles they have red candles they have color drip candles so color drip candles white candle drips red oh that's interesting here we have these candles here with the snowflakes on them those are really pretty $1.99 for those actually how much are these These are $5.99 they have this wreath up here very pretty that one is $29.99 look at this these little snowflake tealight holders oh they're not tealight holders they're for the tall candles oh those are $3.99 I guess that might be really pretty to go together right guys that's cool oh I see a reindeer okay so something else I'm feeling like is trending are the tall tapered candles cuz look you don't really see this so often so they have this black reindeer here for $9.99 and it has a spot for the tapered candle interesting and here we have does this have anything for handles no but it is like a centerpiece and this is $17.99 very pretty we have another wreath up here $39.99 we have these wreaths for $5.99 that we see every year more wreaths down here $29.99 the berry leaves for $12.99 I think this is new these presents so the presents here with the candles inside and these are $39.99 here we have Max for $29.99 and then we also have Cindy luhoo again more of these tapered candles so we have the larger ones for $23.99 these smaller ones are $21.99 they also have them in this brass color and then they have these in silver and these are $11.99 again lots of tapered candles over here we have some filler or popery this is $19.99 for that more candles we've got these candles back here Christmas Joy with a wooden Wick that's $24.99 here they have spice pom here they have another candle oh my God it smells so good you guys $ 199.99 and here red cinnamon oh my gosh red hot cinnamon that one smells really good too that is $9.99 they also have the green sugared Spruce hm ooh I really like that one $9.99 for that as well here we've got some giant red bows they're outdoor bows they are $7.99 here we have some flameless candles they have the LED ones they have these shorter ones these are $9.99 they have the taller ones here these are $12.99 and then they have these lanterns over here these Red Lanterns these are really nice these are $39.99 we've hit the Grinch aisle so here we have that same pillow this is the Grinch this pillow is $29.99 and here they have those trees again you guys I might have to get one I don't know I think I'd want the big one I don't know we'll have to see do I need it no do I want it yes here they have this pillow which this I feel like I might have to get for my entryway because it has a little Grinchy hands aren't those so cute cute that's $39.99 for that so is it worth 20 bucks like when it goes 50% off I don't know I don't know you guys you guys will have to let me know then down here they have these little pink trees is pink going to be trending again I keep saying it you guys I don't know I think so though $9.99 for that my daughter has a pink tree in her room might want to get her a smaller one as well but it looks like that's all they have for the Grinch section now this will be full of Grinch stuff but I will also say the grin stuff goes fast so as soon as it goes to 50% off you're probably going to want to grab it and I'm also going to predict that these trees will go very quickly here they have a Christmas cookie puzzle for a second I thought it was like a cookie decorating kitten and I was like well that's a little early but it's a puzzle for $4.99 we've got the Grinch there and speaking of the Grinch there's a Grinchy wreath guys Grinch is definitely going to be trending this year I can't see the price it's up a little bit too high but we've got the Christmas wreaths up here let's check out this is this some we saw one of these already right does it go on your table or does you hang it up someone told me last year what this was called I can't remember let me know comments down below what these things are called when you hang them on your door I can't remember $ 17.99 they're flame good to know but these are $17.99 and the things that hang on your door oh I wish I could remember again someone told me in the comments last year so if you guys know let me know here we've got some more wreaths over here $ 34.99 and then they've got this giant wreath over here let's see if we can find a price for that that is $79.99 so one important thing to note about all of the Christmas stuff wait until it goes to 50% off it will go to 50% off usually in August I feel like mid to late August it'll be 50% off I think that's usually when I start to get some of my stuff so be on the lookout do not get it before it goes to 50% off but once it does go to 50% off if it's something you really like make sure you get it sooner than later because a lot of the popular items will go they will go fast especially once it hits 50% off I don't remember seeing these last year oh you know I didn't see them because they have these trees here for $39.99 oh look this is not for us this is home decor that's 75% off so don't get confused you guys they have these little tree buckets here so these Tree Farm mistletoe 75% each let's see 75 cents each is what I meant to say $6.99 for that but how cute does that look putting the tree in that little bucket oh yeah they have them all here it is separate though you guys and they have little pine cones on them that are so adorable look at the little pine cones all right and again those are $9.99 for these little trees we've got these over here these are super pretty I love the it's not flocked it's like what's the word it's glistening frosted frosted I'd say that's the word and these frosted wreaths are $34.99 really pretty so a lot of the Christmas decor I can't quite reach but I can show you cuz it's up high but they are starting to display it so they have these white trees over here and then they also have green ones as well and then if you look up top there they have those cone shapes those are going to be like Christmas as well and speaking of cone shape here they have these gold ones those are really pretty too and they have the little bell detail on the front all along here you guys these are all Christmas ornaments all at the top but look how far down it goes just wait it goes all the way all the way all the way all the way down all the way down there you guys it's crazy there's so many Christmas ornaments and I cannot wait to get back and share them all with you guys so it goes all the way down right there I was just talking to the store manager she's absolutely lovely here I'm here in New York and she's just such a lovely woman and she was telling me some of the new items they have and this is one of them the holiday wax warmer for $29.99 she said they've already been selling like a lot of them and it's not even discounted so just be on the lookout that there are some new items and they will go fast the other thing she wanted to share with me I'm going to share with you guys over here is this house so this is a new item for this year and the thing she was telling me is why this one is going so quickly is because you have this like the Christmas side and then she said other people were taking them has a heart here so you can make it Valentine's Day or she said people were putting their names on it and it could just be just a standard piece of Decor in your home so this is $1999 so if you see these these might be going quickly even though they're not on sale yet here again a lot of tapered candle holders here they've got this Christmas tree one so pretty this is $14.99 I'm thinking maybe do I want to do tapered candles this year I mean there's so many pretty tapered candle holders I'm pretty sure I showed you guys most of these in my first shop with me I might not have shown you these brass ones these these are $21.99

go it's a better view those are cool then they have these like holly leaves over here I thought those were super interesting those are $4.99 and they have snowflakes up here they've got like pink ribbon up here I mean they've just got all different kinds of ribbons so again if this is something you would want me to show you guys in a future Hobby Lobby Christmas shop with me let me know in the comments down below same for all the lights if this is something you guys would want to see like the different options and things that go with lights and Command hooks and all that stuff let me know in the comments down below so I'm trying to gear what else I need for my daughter's room I'm doing a pink theme in there I told you I was just getting those pink lights but there were these little houses I'm looking for not these cuz these are how much are these These are $11.99 I could get four of the like paper ones for the same price so I'm going to go see if they still have them if you guys want to see any of this stuff I have shown this in previous shop with M and I did grab one of these snowman the smaller one I don't know why all their noses are missing but I grabbed the smaller one last time was here all right I just picked this up and was surprised at like what it felt like that's a little gingerbread right there it's like paper you guys it's like super lightweight and it's $15.99 my goodness I think I need this tree oh again not what I was expecting it's like foam $7.99 it's not picking up the pink that it is it's actually like really pink but it's not showing like that on camera I think I'm going to get a couple of these for my daughter's room especially at that price they'll be $4 I think I'm going to grab like two maybe three oh my there is a large one it's $15.99 oh do I need the large one I got to put them like next to each other I don't think I need the large one it is cool but I don't think I'm going to have things that go that high but again it's like foam that is neat though I think I'm just going to stick with these smaller ones and get three of them and here's a little snowman I got from my daughter last week I am like in love with this guy here I don't know if I want a nutcracker haven't decided here are the houses I was just talking about you guys and they're already like a little bit picked over so they have the purple one the pink one here

one with the Christmas bulbs that one is $39.99 they have this cone tree for $17.99 I feel like this would be a fun DIY and you probably could do it for cheaper than $9 probably not much cheaper but

reindeer as I like to call them lately people have been a few people have commented about me calling them reindeer instead of deer so I was like doing some research and apparently deer this is $25.99 I think I knew this already I definitely knew this male and female reindeer both have antlers and reindeer are actually domesticated Caribou cuz here in the uh Northeast or or in North America they have caribou and if they're domestic they're called reindeer so they're probably dear you guys but because it's Christmas decor I like calling them reindeer or I don't even really think about it to be honest but uh yeah I mean they could be deer or reindeer but these guys over here by the way uh as I'm ranting here are 25.99 speaking of reindeer $33.99 for this guy apparently reindeer have larger antlers and there's like a whole variety of them new guys so I went down a deep deep Rabbit Hole this morning it was like 5:00 a.m. and I was up and uh they have these ornaments which I I haven't been

these Robert Stanley ornaments yet these are $19.99 all right we're going to take a quick Gander down the gingerbread aisle don't really have time today to see if there's too many new things but I

this way again if I'm going fast guys I'll be back next week oh this is new these are new okay we saw the Christmas tree last time now they have a snowman oh it's so cute $116.99 for that and then they also have a wreath version like a cookie wreath version that's so cute all right so now let's go back on the the candy side not seeing too many new things if I see any new oh those things are right over here so they have those things right over there let's see not really [Music] like I was calling things like this reindeer guys but those are deer they have no aners but you you guys know

Christmas leave me a green heart emoji in the comments down below and now let's take a look at what they have all right you guys as promised I said I would come back this week and I would share the Grinch aisle you guys there's so much Grinch stuff at the front of the store and also see there's a ladder down there because they're just they keep rolling out more Grinch stuff so if I pass over anything it's only because I showed it in a previous shop with me so go check out my previous Hobby Lobby shop with me I have so many of them you guys I think I have like 10 or 11 so I'll link them all down below we have Merry Christmas with Cindy luhoo and Max that is $7.99 we have all sweaters are ugly that is $6.99 oh it's also I want to point out it has like a little hook here if you wanted to hang that up we have Mary whatever here Mary whatever is $8.99 and then they have twz the night before gringas so many cute tear trade signs that is $6.99 and then here on the end we have Max so cute that is $4.99 they have these Grinch buckets here these are $118.99 and it looks like they have smaller ones inside so they have Max here for $12.99 and then my guess is it's going to be Cindy L who oh no it's just alloo all right that is $6.99 so if you wanted to get yourself a set of these you could definitely do that they also have these Grinch buckets here so if you were going to make your kids like a jolly basket like if you wanted to give your kids or grandkids or you know nieces nephews whoever if you wanted to get them something a ahead of time for Christmas like Christmas pajamas and Christmas crafts and stuff you can definitely put that in here that is $88.99 and they also have it in this version as well for $12.99 they have the line between naughty and nice is constantly moving that's funny here they have the grinches back for $19.99 here we have what I think is a tablecloth they're calling it a beastro slay Bell beastro uh I think that's what it's supposed to be $21.99 for that here they have what's not Grinch related but they have a car costume so if you wanted to make your car Rudolph you could do that that is $24.99 before the discount I don't know if we saw the Grinch beanies I'll show them to you these are $13.99 for the Grinch beanies they have these little Grinch stockings here which I definitely do not think we saw $12.99 for those here we have a baby bib $10.99 we've got gift tags super cute $3.99 there's 12 gift tags and you get three of each so we've got Max back there the grin I see Cindy Lou who and there's probably a fourth one if there's three each then we have these little Grinch notebooks so again these would be great things to put in a Jolly basket they have this one over here and they have this one here these are $6.99 or did they just come in two oh so that's the back of this one and then this one what's on the back of this one Max okay again a lot of great things for a jolly Bas we've got some Grinch playing cards here that's cute $8.99 for those some squishimal or they're calling them squish squishes these are $7.9 .99 here we have slab bracelets my kids love these I had them when I was a kid too $6.99 for $6.99 they have a patch here we've got these little tin card holders so they have different ones or this looks like this is the only kind they have these are $4.99 for those we have these little bendable toys if you have multiple kids this would be great it looks like you get six in a pack and these are $8.49 we've got down here if you want to make Grinch pancakes I have a Mickey Mouse version of this and my kids love it this is $7.99 okay so when it has the yellow tag one of my followers told me one of my viewers told me if it has the yellow tag then that is the final price you don't get a discount on it so let me know in the comments down below if that is correct I believe my viewers so I assume that is correct here oh this is new the hot cocoa bar at least I don't believe we had it in my store last year so they have here okay let's look they've got peppermint they've got hazelnut caramel and milk chocolate and this is $9.99 without uh the 50% discount or it won't get a 50% discount again because of the yellow tag here we have nine Cocos of grinchmas so we've got cinnamon candy cane hazelnut double chocolate milk chocolate caramel French vanilla I think that's gingerbread behind there and toasted marshmallow and again we've got another yellow tag at $7.99 so that's cool if you wanted to do a hot cocoa bar I did a hot cocoa bar but I don't love it at all so I'm probably going to redo it I don't think I'm going to do a grinch them theme but but now that I know these things are here that might be something I do next year so just going to keep that in the back of my mind that I have a grinch area and entryway but maybe I'll change where I have my Grinch Decor next year so here we've got some Grinch earrings that are so cute and a necklace $12.99 for that I mean so many things here you guys if you wanted to give it to your kids before Christmas again as like a little Jolly basket 9.99 for these bracelets my daughter she loves jewelry like she loves bracelets and things so I feel like she'd really like that top one the little Grinch one there we've got a grinch poppet here that is $5.99 we've got some Grinchy pencils up here these are $8.99 we've got the Grinch and we've got Max and then this looks like we've got the Grinch and Cindy L who here here they have those beads I forget what they're called the peer peer beads so you iron them so we have a whole bunch of these here these are 16.99 you have kids who are a little bit older that might be a fun craft to do with them and maybe you don't want that many maybe you just want one although I feel like $16.99 for six of them is probably a better deal it looks like you just get one here how many do you get here looks like it's just one it's just the one Cindy L whoo and that one's $4.49 so I'd say that's probably the better bang for your book here they have some headbands these or just one headband these are really cute you've got the Grinch on there that is $8.99 here they have ho has so it looks like what is it oh it's it's confetti putty and that is $4.99 so many good things you guys for a jolly basket here here they have treat bags so if you were going to give out some treats maybe to other kids in your kids class or maybe just to friends if you wanted to put some cookies in here $4.99 for 20 of these that's pretty good does it come with little tags yeah it comes with the the ties here though I'd probably tape them cloes just because I'd want you to be able to like see everybody there then here they have plant picks so you get a set of three of those and let's see how much is that that is $17.99 I also feel like you could probably put this in a cake if you wanted to have like a grinch themed birthday if your birthday's around Christmas time or just you know wanted to have a grinch cake I think you can definitely do that here we have an oven mitt that is $7.99 so no discount there then I think look at this you guys I think what is this what are they calling it so this is $5.99 I think it's a scraper I think that's what it is but it also has the measurements on the back so that's pretty neat and here they have a set of two reusable pouches so if you want to do some like fun lunch ideas I might do some Christmas lunch ideas you guys let me know in the comments down below if that's something you'd like to see $8.99 probably little bit later we're in October I'm think probably like maybe sometime in November just because that's you know we we're to do a lot of shop with me and decorating and and you know what to get your kids for
