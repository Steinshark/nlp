Ozgur: It's frozen, isn't it? Burcu: Oh, there's snow on top. Burcu: Okay, I think you should turn it off. Burcu: Turn it off, I'm going to pick flowers. Ozgur: I wonder if there's an entrance over there? Ozgur: Look. Ozgur: It's just mud underneath. It's very soft. Ozgur: It's worse ahead. Ozgur: Should I try the upper road? Ozgur: Huh? Ozgur: How is it here? Burcu: It's actually good where you are standing now. Ozgur: Move aside. Ozgur: Make it straight. Ozgur: That's a lot of ice. Ozgur: It's hot. Burcu: Okay. Burcu: I think it's enough. Ozgur: I have a runny nose. Burcu: Let's just throw it. One, two, three. Ozgur: Yes. Burcu: I'm pulling. One, two, three. Burcu: Okay? Ozgur: It's snowing beautifully. Burcu: It's frozen. That's why it's hard to close. Burcu: Does it have batteries in it? Ozgur: It had batteries. Ozgur: Is your other foot getting warm? Burcu: It's about to boil. Burcu: Let's make some soup. Ozgur: That'll be great, we're starving. Burcu: Soup with snow water. Burcu: Put it here. Ozgur: The soup? Burcu: Great. Burcu: It's snowing beautifully. Ozgur: It's delicious? Burcu: Is it? Burcu: That's the lake over there. Ozgur: It must be frozen there too. Ozgur: A sturdy oak... Ozgur: And a mad joy. Burcu: I think that's ready. It's enough. Burcu: Add it. Burcu: I have to pick flowers. Burcu: Look, there's movement here. Ozgur: This was there when we arrived. Burcu: Okay, they are walking around here. Burcu: There are traces here too. Ozgur: Over there? Ozgur: Here? Burcu: Right there. Burcu: That's their territory, look. Burcu: Right here is its territory. Ozgur: Turn it off honey. Burcu: It's working. Ozgur: Ah, now it's working. Ozgur: Come on. Burcu: It's frozen here. Ozgur: These are freezing. Ozgur: Yes. Burcu: How cold is it? Should we measure it? It's quite cold. Ozgur: The blanket is single, right? Burcu: Double. Burcu: Make it horizontal. Burcu: Yes, that would be better. Ozgur: At least... Ozgur: They're already together. Ozgur: I'm turning it on to first level. Ozgur: -13. Ozgur: -14. Ozgur: That's enough for now. Ozgur: It's hot. Ozgur: Isn't it? Burcu: The stove is out. Ozgur: Huh? Ozgur: What? Burcu: It feels almost as cold as outside. Ozgur: Yeah. Burcu: If it wasn't for the electric blanket, we would have been doomed. Burcu: Where are you going to get water? Ozgur: I'll fill it from there. Ozgur: I hope we don't sink? Burcu: I wonder if the lake is frozen. Ozgur: Be careful. Ozgur: Don't follow me if I go down. Burcu: You're on the lake now. Ozgur: I'm on the lake? Ozgur: Should I set it up back or here? Ozgur: That's a lot, good. Ozgur: On both sides... Ozgur: Then I'll attach that carabiner over there. Ozgur: Like this. Ozgur: Actually, you can sleep like this Ozgur: Look. Ozgur: It takes the shape of your body. Ozgur: Let me see. Ozgur: It's very hot. Ozgur: Good. Burcu: Is that enough? Ozgur: Okay. Burcu: Enough. Burcu: I'm freezing. Burcu: Don't let it burn at the bottom. Burcu: Did you turn it down? It's burning now. Burcu: Maybe you should put it on the bottom? Ozgur: Let me take this then. Burcu: Because the egg is not cooked. Burcu: It's ready. Burcu: Are you going to cut it? Burcu: Let's give it to the birds. Ozgur: Where? Should I put it somewhere in the open? Ozgur: Oh, it's like a stick. Ozgur: Where should I put it? Ozgur: I hope it won't get lost in the snow. Ozgur: Should we go to the camera trap? Burcu: You can tell by the footprints Ozgur: I can't see anything right now. Ozgur: There's nothing here. Burcu: Because all the food is frozen. Burcu: I have to pick flowers. Burcu: Where should we go? Ozgur: Where? Burcu: That's good. Burcu: Okay, turn it off. Burcu: Turn it off, I'm going to pick flowers. Burcu: It's snowing beautifully. Ozgur: It's frozen, isn't it? Burcu: Ecoflow is frozen too. Burcu: Look. Ozgur: It's really frozen here. Ozgur: I'm on the lake right now. Burcu: Jump on it. Ozgur: Nope. Ozgur: It's like concrete. Ozgur: I'll go get the axe. Ozgur: Maybe you shouldn't stand there. Burcu: Why? Ozgur: That's thick. Ozgur: We've reached the grass. Ozgur: I have to go a little further towards the center. Burcu: Because this is the muddy part. Burcu: It's like 20-25 centimeters, maybe 30. Burcu: There's a swamp underneath. Ozgur: We're not there yet. Ozgur: God. Is all the water frozen? Burcu: There wasn't much water anyway. Ozgur: But there was a lot of water here. Ozgur: Even if I drove on top of this, I'd be fine. Ozgur: Bring the button to the center. Ozgur: Bring the button to the center so that no air can get in. Burcu: There's garbage left. Burcu: Can you see the water? Burcu: Oh, there's snow on the top. Burcu: How are we going to pack it up? Burcu: It's covered with snow again. Burcu: The rope is like a pile. Burcu: The stove was here. Ozgur: The snow will get more and more. Check out. Ozgur: Let's swing it. One... Burcu: Two... Ozgur: Three. Ozgur: Whoa. Burcu: I wish we had stayed one more day. Ozgur: Unfortunately we can't. Ozgur: Oh, we're stuck.
