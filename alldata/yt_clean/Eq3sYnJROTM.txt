HEADING INTO THE END OF THE LOOKING FORWARD TO 2025 AND KEITH LERNER IS STAYING STAY IN THIS FINAL MONTH. WE REMAIN ALIGNED WITH THE OPPORTUNITIES REMAIN, YET A DELICATE LANDSCAPE OR MUCH LIKE A PULLED A CHINA COMPLEXITIES. JOINS US NOW. ANALOGY FOR THIS MOMENT BUT IN ARE GETTING NOTE AFTER NOTE 2025. 7000 FOR YEAR-END, THE HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT THE NOT JUST CONTINUE BUT CONTINUE &gt;&gt; WE TEND TO FOCUS MORE ON THE THE TRENDS. ALIGNED WITH THE PRIMARY TREND THAT IS STILL POSITIVE. STICK WITH IT. IT IS A DELICATE BALANCE. SHOP. YOU STICK WITH THAT BULL THINGS THAT COULD BE BROKEN. WIDER POLICY OUTCOMES. SAY LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS BULL IS UP ABOUT 70% OVER THE LAST THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE WHICH IS THE LAST FOUR YEARS STANDS TO ON A THREE YEAR BASIS, THIS SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE. THAT REALLY TOUGH 2022. WHEN YOU ZOOM OUT, NOT AS VALUATIONS CERTAINLY RICH, MORE EXTREME, SO THAT BAR FOR HIGHER. BACK TO THE ECONOMY. ECONOMY IS EXPANDING. SO I GUESS TO WRAP THAT UP, WE IS HIGHER BUT WE ARE PROBABLY ALONG THE WAY WHICH WILL LIKELY DANI: IS WHAT POWER THIS MARKET IN IT HAD BEEN BRANDS MORE BEARISH TODAY. TO WHAT DEGREE DOES THAT CONTINUE TO BE THE DRIVER VS. UNCERTAINTY OF TARIFFS? &gt;&gt; I THINK THE RIDE NEXT YEAR WE HAVE THIS TENSION THAT WILL WE KNOW THAT THE POSITIVES ON LIKELY A LITTLE BIT LOWER BUT WE ALSO KNOW THE OTHER SIDE AROUND TARIFFS. LAST WEEK THERE WERE SOME MARKET ACTUALLY HELD RELATIVELY WE WILL SEE HOW THAT CONTINUES AND THEN ALSO WE HAVE TO KEEP INTEREST RATES. WHERE OUR HOUSE VIEWS THE YEAR, STOCKS TEND TO CLAM ABOUT ECONOMY IS EXPANDING. THAT AND ALSO EVEN THOUGH THERE DISRUPTIONS, WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS NOT TO UNDERESTIMATE THE IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE ONES IN HIGHEST INFLATION SINCE THE PUSH ALONG. GDP ESTIMATE IS ABOVE 3%. AND ALSO THAT TRANSLATING INTO DANI: HAPPENING IN EUROPE AND ASIA, EXCEPTIONALISM NARRATIVE REALLY THERE IS AT LEAST ONE PERSON A BUBBLE, THE CHAIR OF HE SAID THAT THE OVERWHELMING BETWEEN THE U.S. THE EARNINGS POWER, THE GLOBAL INNOVATION. BUT ONE DEFINITION OF A BUBBLE TOO FAR. AMERICA'S OVER-OWNED, DEGREE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. ISSUE WITH THAT, BUT WHAT DO THE U.S. NARRATIVE RUN TOO FAR? &gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS AN INTERESTING FIRST OF ALL, WE'VE BEEN TEAM IT IS NOT A NEW STANCE FOR US. WHY HAS THE U.S. MARKETS, IF YOU OVERLAY JUST TRENDS HAVE BEEN MUCH STRONGER, COINCIDED WITH THOSE STRONG EUROPE IS STILL SOMEWHAT THE OTHER THING THAT TENDS TO OUTPERFORMANCE IS STRENGTH IN IF YOU OVERLAY THE U.S. FOR THAT TO REALLY CHANGE, FOR TO UNDERPERFORM IN A MEANINGFUL MOVE DOWN AND PROBABLY ONE OF SECTOR ALLOCATION. ALLOCATION IN THE U.S.. IT IS NOT ANYWHERE CLOSE. OUTPERFORMING BY OVER 200%. ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS, RELATIVE STRETCHED. SOME SHARP BALANCES MAYBE EVEN FUNDAMENTAL PRIMARY TRENDS ARE I KNOW YOU ARE LOOKING HEADING INTO 2025. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE BEEN OVERWEIGHT TECH WE ALSO LIKE FINANCIALS ON KIND MORE RECENTLY. VIEW. I DO THINK WE WILL SEE STEEPER YIELD CURVE. FINANCIALS. WHICH IS KIND OF ALONGSIDE TECH. THE BULL MARKET, THE EARNINGS HE STILL THINK THAT CONTINUES. WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT OF AN AI IF WE HAVE THIS PING-PONG, YOU DEFENSE, A LITTLE CYCLICAL. ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO CATCH UP DOING IT MUCH MORE OFTEN AND IN DEFENSE, A LITTLE CYCLICAL. REJECTS ELON MUSK'S PACKAGE. ON YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. DANI: ARE LOOKING LIVE AT THE COMING UP, CLIFF ASNESS OF A QR IF YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. CHINA HAS RESPONDED TO TERMS ON THE COUNTRIES ACCESS BEIJING ANNOUNCED AN OUTRIGHT MATERIALS CRUCIAL TO CHIPMAKING CONCERNS.

DANI: I JUST WONDER CONSIDERING WE DIFFERENT WILL A TRUMP TO CHINA THE FROM BIDEN? ALREADY FROM THE INCOMING &gt;&gt; TRUMP LOVES TO TALK ABOUT TARIFFS. WHETHER THEY WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BROADLY OR MORE TO BE SEEN. WILL DO. BUT HE HAS DEFINITELY TALKED A TARIFFS AGAINST CHINA IN A DANI: OPPOSING THE SALE OF U.S. TALKED ABOUT TAX INCENTIVES AS WHAT EXACTLY IS HE PROPOSING? &gt;&gt; LIKE YOU SAID, TARIFFS AND STEEL IN THE UNITED STATES. U.S. STATES, HE SHARES THAT POSITION NOT VOWED TO BLOCK THIS SALE SAID THAT HE THINKS U.S. STATES, OR U.S. OWNED. PLACE WHERE THEY ACTUALLY SEEM AND HOW TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN IS DIFFERENT PATH FOR BOTH WE'VE BEEN REALLY PARSING THE SAYS ON SOCIAL, BUT WHO HE IS NOMINATING FOR VARIOUS YESTERDAY TALKING ABOUT THE THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY IN RELEASED BY JANUARY 20. NOT JUST IN WHAT HE IS PUTTING HE HAS PUT IN POWER AND HIS GAZA? &gt;&gt; THAT IS A REALLY GOOD TRUMP HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT ACTIONS IN GAZA AND SUPPORTS I THINK THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT AMERICAN-ISRAELI DUAL CITIZEN HE HAD BEEN BELIEVED TO BE A I THINK THAT SORT OF ESCALATES IT IS UNCLEAR WHEN HE SAYS HELL ADDITION TO WHAT IS ALREADY THEY'VE TAKEN OUT THE NOT A LOT OF GAZA SO WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT IS TO BE DOUBLING DOWN ON HIS ACTIONS. &gt;&gt; REALLY APPRECIATE IT, THANKS NOW TO BRING YOU A BLOOMBERG TENDER OFFER AND IT WOULD BOOST AROUND $350 BILLION ACCORDING JOINING US NOW IS TOM MACKENZIE.

EXPECTATION, THE OPTIMISM THAT MUSK TOUCHES NOW THAT HE PRESIDENT TRUMP. YOU SEEM TESLA SHARES ALONE OVER 40% SINCE NOVEMBER 5, SO INCREASED AS WELL. IN TERMS OF GETTING SATELLITE 6000 SATELLITE INTO ORBIT AND WE'VE SEEN THAT RECENTLY WITH ONE OF THE MOST RECENT LAUNCHES. SINCE IT'S START HAS BENEFITED FEDERAL CONTRACTS, AND AGAIN, THAT GIVEN WHERE HE SITS NOW AT CONTRACT WILL CONTINUE TO FLOW IT REALLY JUST UNDERSCORES THAT PRIVATELY HELD COMPANY IN THE THAT IS ABOUT THE MARKET CAP OF PERSPECTIVE. DANI: ONE WIN FOR MUSK AND ONE LOSS THIS TESLA PAY PACKAGE WITH ONCE AGAIN BY A DELAWARE JUDGE. &gt;&gt; THE SAME DELAWARE JUDGE INITIAL JUDGMENT CAME THROUGH THAT THIS PAY PACKAGE THAT WAS OPTIONS FOR MUSK WORSE THAN THE DOLLARS BACK IN 2018 WHEN IT THE WAY THAT WAS STRUCTURED, WITH THAT PAY PACKAGE, THAT THE BY MUSK AT THE TIME.
