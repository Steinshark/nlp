Eating, training, and sleeping. Those are the most important things. 2nd and 3rd years get their own rooms. I clean every day. Aim for the goal! Are you joining us for bath time? JFC Ole! JFC Ole! I'm the dorm supervisor of the Gamba Osaka Academy Seisho Dormitory. My name's Kato. Looking forward to working together today. We have 40 high schoolers, and one middle school kid. It's all boys living together here. It's really fun! Not fun days, but fun hours. They all already change within minutes and seconds. So much can happen in so little time. In the cafeteria at breakfast too. The cafeteria staff comes here around 5am and starts preparing. Today's breakfast is curry. So I'll start cooking the curry now. Protein is the main part of their diet. I'm draining the pork in the colander now. To reduce the fat a bit. They have cleaning duties in the mornings. The second graders are on duty today. I'm so tired. Here you go! I'm dead tired. You know... really tired. It's tasty as always. Deli~~sh! They HAVE to use this! Breakfast is a treasure trove of vitamins. You absorb them at a much higher rate after getting up in the morning. That's something that all of them get to study about at the stadium's nutrition workshops. Yes we do! It's sweet and sludgy, sugary and delicious! They can use that, cut! Wha-! Everyone's just waking up, and some are still half asleep. That's high school life. Some of them sleep until the very last minute, since they're exhausted from school and training. We're just prepping the Bento's for the 1st graders, since they'll leave for school now. They're vertical lunch boxes. They go to school and study, and then go to training after, so we pack up a lot of food for them. We're off to school now! Our room's quite messy. I clean every day! Liar! The 2nd and 3rd year students get their own rooms. Alright! Don't put on airs, dude! You're such a cool kid! Have a good day! I'm off! Have a good day! I'm off! Have a good day. I'm off! It takes around 30 minutes to get there. Today, we're making rice balls wrapped in meat. It's all ready! The normal menu please. Got it, one normal please! Me too, the normal one please. You too, got it. Here's the normal one. Here you go! Thanks for the food. Delish! So much food. The portions are huge. It's tasty. This is, uhm.... Japanese riceball. How do you say &quot;traditional&quot;? Think for yourself! Traditional? Traditional. Traditional, yes!! Here he goes! So, first of all.... Go turn to the camera! First of all.... Ok, wait a minute. I'm no good at this! I really can't! I'm always grateful. Is the expiration date ok? I take yogurt and put chia seeds on it. Not sure what chia actually is. Then I put honey on it. I hear it helps the intestinal environment. I've been taking care of my body more proactively lately. It's delicious, soft and crunchy. I've already been out in the field for 3 hours, so taking digestion into consideration, it's really important to choose what to eat. Thinking about nutrition too. I keep my room properly clean. I'm a 3rd year. I was a bit worried at first, but hanging out with everyone is fun. And this building was just built, so it's very clean and convenient. My goal is to become like Yasuhito Endo. I got these from him. They are great on the field. This place is close to the training ground. I think it's a great environment. It's 3 or 4 minutes by bike, and 5 minutes on foot. On top of the hill. This is a group of kids that has been chosen, and passed the tests to come here. Soccer is a world sport, so they are aiming to fly out into the world. They've all come here with dreams. So we want to give them the best living environment as possible. Here they can concentrate on healthy food, getting good sleep, training, coming home, eating again.... They are our children. Our 41 children. They're part of one group, but each one of them is so unique and different. I worry every day about how to best communicate with them. What words and tone I should use. It's a big group of friends loving soccer. They are living as a group. I really want them to give it their all. That's the parental feelings I have for them. I'm off. Have a good day! I'm off! Have a good day! I'm off! The right! Ball side! Tomorrow we start at 4pm as well. Alright, let's head back. Oh no!!! I'm back. Welcome back! Good evening. Good evening! Good evening. I forgot my socks! God dammit! and a great source for protein. So I always finish it all. Hey Araki! How's today's dinner? Today's dinner has lots of protein. Protein is everything to an athlete. The food builds our bodies. I've only gotten 194cm tall because of this food. Food and sleep. Training, eating and sleeping. Those are the most important things. It's all thanks to this food! Thanks! Thank you! This is milk with brown sugar! Shake Time! Delish! It's gonna double my muscle mass. What part of the body does protein work best for? For me, it works best for this part here. What muscle is this? The upper arm...wait no. Biceps? I see! You're out! Next is bath time! Are you gonna join us? Come join us! Thanks man! Nice, Shunpei! Cold! Alternating between cold and hot water, is supposed to improve the blood flow and promote muscle recovery. Waaaah!!! It's freezing! Here I go! The devil is outside! Blessings are within! JFC Ole! JFC Ole! JFC Ole! JFC Ole! JFC Ole! JFC Ole!
