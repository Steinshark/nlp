Did you get it? What's that? Which department? What's your name? It's not from our school. We've done everything we can. We found the post. The IP is from Yunzhou. It was posted by a high school student named Joey. A high school student? That's right. Looks like A new star in math. It's about to rise again. Come on, now. Prepare the plane. Go to Yunzhou I'll give him the title of senior professor I'll give him the title of senior professor The examination has officially begun Candidates, pay attention to the discipline of the examination room Do you think you've gotten thinner and better looking? Think you'll be able to think better too? When the results come out You'll still be a disgrace. I'm done. Hey, Qiao Ying. It's only been ten minutes since the exam started. Are you kidding me? You can't go on pretending, can you? Are you going to turn in a blank paper? You're just writing a bunch of nonsense. So you're done? Because of your attitude. You don't deserve to be a student in our school. Teacher. Do you want to correct My test paper Qiao Ying You've got too much guts How dare you cheat? Cheating? Do you have any proof? I don't know your level The answers on this paper are all correct. That's not true. You can't do it by yourself. I've been teaching for so many years I've seen so many cheating students Like you who cheated And you dare to question the teacher in front of the class This is the first time I've seen Qiao Ying You really have a lot of courage You've said so much There's still no evidence Convicting a student based on prejudice alone I think you 're a teacher I think you're done as a teacher. Shut up! How dare you say that to me? You didn't copy this. You stole the questions and memorized the answers. I didn't. If you say you didn't, you didn't. Who will testify for you? I will. I can testify for her. Who are you and how did you get in here? This is a school. It's not a food market. It's you. What are you doing here? You did me a favor. Of course I'm going to help you. It's good that he's here. Saves me from having to do it myself. Falsely accusing and slandering students at will. Qiao Ying is right You' ve done your job as a teacher. Am I wrong? Qiao Ying's last practice test She only scored 5 points How can she get a perfect score this time? Since she has no proof She didn't steal the questions and memorize the answers. Then isn't it true? As a teacher. It's not a bad idea to fire her. Boss! Here. You brought the papers and answers back to the office You brought them back to the office yourself. In that half hour. No one has entered the office at all How did Qiao Ying steal the answers? Qin Yan Call the Education Bureau Remove her from the teaching system immediately Let's go! Stop right there! Who are you? You don't need to know who I am. All you need to know is I'm in a position to take care of you. No way! Qiao Ying's family has no power How could they know someone so powerful? I know You're an actor hired by Qiao Ying You're acting on my on behalf of Good for you, Qiao Ying! Not only did you cheat You've also joined forces with social workers You attacked and retaliated against your teacher I'll teach you a lesson today I'll teach you a lesson You don't know what you're doing. Beating up students I think you don't deserve to be a teacher Qiao Ying, how dare you hit a teacher? How dare she hit a teacher? She looks like a different person What's going on in your class? Carry on, Mr. Wang. This student She joined forces with a social worker from outside the school. She's making trouble and beating people up. Why don't you call security? Security guard! Wait a minute. Are you the principal? Yes, I am. Do you know who I am? How would I know who you are? My name is Qin. What does it have to do with me? This isn't Jiangcheng. It's not a small town like this. Who would think you 're a Qin? Why don't you ask What did she do? Mr. Liu. Tell me. What happened? This student cheated. She still won't admit it. I repeat. I didn't. We've seen the surveillance cameras. What's there to suspect? Since you said you You didn't steal the questions and memorize the answers. Then why did you get a perfect score today? Why did you get a perfect score today? Is it possible? You fell down the stairs You fell down the stairs and made a genius out of it? My sister is a genius. And who are you? Qiao Yi Why is he here? The math problem you made. I uploaded it to the forum of Qingbei University The post was an instant hit The president of Qingbei University said As long as you can do this problem No matter what your status is Can get the special admission qualification of Qingbei Sister You're going to be admitted to Qingbei University. The math problem. Did you do that math problem? What math problem? It can't be Qingbei University. Professor Mathematician of Qingbei University That math problem from half a year ago?

She's absolutely incapable of doing it Good hand Qiao Ying Let's see what else you can do What else can you do to cover up cheating? May I ask if Qiao Yi is here? And who are you? How are you? I'm the president of Qingbei University. Mr. Zhang Chengyong. Mr. Zhang is here. I'm sorry to have missed you. Which student were you looking for? A high school student named Qiao Yi.

That was solved by my sister, Qiao Ying. I just uploaded it for her. I can't believe it. The small Yunzhou University It's a place of hidden dragons and crouching tigers. Qin! Mr. Qin. Why are you here? Just like you. He's here for her. He's the head of the Qin family, Qin Han Yue. Ten million dollars is not enough. Mr. Qin. Are you the one from the capital? Principal Wang. Who is this man? Shut up! The president of Qingbei University is here. Has Qiao Ying really gotten smarter ? Mr. Qiao! Did you really make that question? Yes, I did. Mr. Zhang!

And She even said shamelessly She solved it in 10 minutes. It's impossible. What's that? Ten minutes. That's right. I watched my sister She solved this puzzle with my own eyes. It only took ten minutes. Mr. Joe. Can I see the original The original of your problem solving process? I'm sorry. You're late. Who did this? Who did this? Principal Zhang. Ting You can't listen to Qiao Ying's words You can't just believe her . Maybe she's a liar She might have made it up That's right It's impossible These six drafts As soon as they were posted on the forum. I organized the Qingbei University All the professors of the math department We verified them Are you questioning our Qingbei University's ability ? No, no, no That's not what I meant Mr. Qin You are also our Qingbei University Mathematics Department graduates You should understand The solution to this problem is so ingenious Indeed I just took a look at it It's the optimal solution. No, it's not. These six pages It's not the optimal solution. It's the optimal solution to this problem. Genius. Five minutes. She took five minutes. She's using a variant of the Colchis equation. A variant solution. With this kind of thinking. I can't believe it's that easy. She's a math genius. That's right. Principal Wang saw it? Carry on I'm going to transfer Qiao Ying's enrollment To our Qingbei University Good This is an honor for Yunzhou University Mr. Qiao. Will you do it?

But since I've decided To live an easy life It's better not to reveal my identity I'm just an ordinary person I won't bother you Qiao Ying You're not an ordinary person Oh! How am I not ordinary? You're a young genius One in a million young genius That question was really hard. I just looked at it. I knew it. He's not capable He's not capable of recognizing my identity. What do you mean?

I don't need company for anything. It's me who wants to go with you Mr. Qin said such warm words. I'm sure he's not after me. That's right. Is that okay? I'm sorry. Go on. Mr. San. Are you interested in Ms. Qiao? Yes. She's very special. Is it because She saved your life? No, no, no, no, no. Because she's not afraid of me. Qin Yan In my position I was lonely Whenever outsiders hear The name of the Qin family's Third Master Qin They would automatically categorize me as I'm from another world. But she won't. I think from now on I shouldn't have to be a lonely person anymore So what does Ms. Qiao mean? Can we go after her or not? If she doesn't refuse, that means she's in agreement If I don't pursue her It would be too much to ask Having lived two lives. I've lived two lifetimes, but I've had a lot of luck with the Herbal Formula. I've heard that your clinic Is the best TCM center in the country Do you want these two ginsengs? MING LAO, Mr. Wan. Are they 200 years old? How much is it? I don't need it. I'm not short of money either. If you want it, I'll give it to you. But I have one condition. It must be free to those who need it. Not for the sake of making money. Sell it to the rich as a tonic. You're so young to have such a big heart. Good. I'll remember that. I won't let you down. How are you? Are you looking for a doctor or medicine? Medicine? This medicine? I'm afraid you can't afford it. Since I'm here. Just tell me. Just tell me how much it costs. This prescription says &quot;200 years old wild ginseng. Do you know how rare it is? How precious it is? 15 million dollars a piece. How about it? Do you have enough money? 1,500 square meters. Did Ming set the price? Or did you? Don't worry about who set the price. This medicine is worth this much. It's not up to you. I want to see Mr. Ming I said, little girl What do you mean? Are you questioning I'm selling something wrong I think there's something wrong with you How dare you make trouble at my Baicao Zhenfang? Come on! Drag me out! Wait a minute. Aigoo! Mr. Qin. I didn 't expect you to come to my store. What are you doing here? I came to catch up with you. Isn't that right? I'm just in time. It seems Swiping a credit card isn't as good as swiping Mr. Qin's face. With an apprentice like you. I'd say it's been a good life for Herbals and Cherubs. It's too good to be true. I'm offended. You did take offense. Aigoo! Mr. Ming. You' re a good disciple of Hyakuso Jinfang. You should be taught a lesson. Master San. I won't dare to do it again. Mr. Qin. Mr. Qin. What a coincidence. How many times have I told you? We use the Hundred Herbs Formula to treat the sick and save lives. We don't care how high or low you are. You're so arrogant and disrespectful. You're a disgrace to me. Master. I know I'm wrong Master Qin . It's all my fault. I've offended your daughter. Hey! An ordinary friend. I've offended your common friend. Ms. Qiao. Please do me a favor. I'll teach him a good lesson from now on. I won't do it again. He's just Mr. Qin's mistress. You're such a bully. Principal Zhang is having a headache. Yes, it is. It's an old problem. Ms. Qiao. You only took one look. You knew what's wrong with Mr. Zhang just by looking at him? Do you know something about medicine? A friend taught me. I know a little bit about it. Oh, I see. Then I'm really sorry. Hey! Why do you say that, Mr. Ming? I've had a head cold for years. If not for your help. How can I get relief? But There are a few stitches They're wrong. What did you say? Mr. Zhang. Let me try. This is actually the long lost &quot;Thirteen Stitches of the Phoenix&quot;. Hold on. It's done. Uh-huh. Ai! It's amazing. My headache is gone. I feel so refreshed. I didn't realize that the &quot;Thirteen Needles of the Phoenix &quot;Thirteen Phoenix Needles I've had the honor of seeing them today. Mr. Qiao. Could you please come to our medical school Your medical skills I'd like to teach you a few things. Hey! Ms. Qiao My old man would like to be your teacher Please teach me the &quot;Thirteen Stitches of the Phoenix&quot;. Please teach me. Damn it! I just learned it from a friend. &quot;Thirteen Stitches of the Phoenix&quot; It's an ancient book It's a lost art from the ancient book &quot;Marrow Cleansing Record&quot;. I've studied it all my life. I've looked through countless books but I've never learned it. I didn't know you'd learn it right away. I only read the book once. I didn't realize it was so hard to learn. Since I'm in the business of healing people. I'll teach you everything I know. But Can you learn it? How much can I learn? I don't care. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. I'm going I'll go to Qingbei Medical College Talk to the dean To organize a special Lecture to teach Save me a seat I'll go to see the world too Ms. Qiao Don't go back on your word. Ha ha ha! Ms. Qiao. Aren't you coming to get some medicine today? I'll go and get it for you myself. Wait a minute. I can't afford to buy the medicines of your Hundred Herbs Prescription. them. What do you mean? Which medicine? The 200-year-old wild ginseng. I've told you many times Those two boxes of ginseng are for emergencies. If anyone needs them. It's a free gift How dare you take it and sell it? Aigoo, Master It's just that I've lost my mind for a moment. I won't dare to do it again Free of charge. Your pupil But it's 15 million sticks. You bastard! You've disgraced me! That's not true. Where's my ginseng? I clearly put ginseng in it. How come there are two ordinary ginsengs? Master! It's all my fault. I deserve to die! Go ahead and hit me Yell at me! What's going on? Explain it to me. Two years ago A nobleman from Jiangcheng came to ask for medicine I sold it to him Master Those two wild ginsengs Hard to find for a hundred years If you give them away for free I'm sure they won't treasure them Since there's a nobleman who wants them Let's charge them appropriately Isn't it only natural? Bastard! We're on guard day and night. It's hard to prevent a thief from entering the house. You're so stupid. Master! I'll be damned! I'm an asshole! I deserve to die! Master. Please forgive me this time You've beaten me You've scolded me. I really know I'm wrong. I've been here for ten years. I don 't deserve any credit. I've done my share of hard work. Get lost! Get out of the Baicao Jen Fang! I don't have you as my disciple. Get out of here! Wait a minute. Stealing herbs. Cheating patients. If you're out there in the future. With the name of &quot;Hundred Herbs Prescription&quot;. You'll be practicing medicine and making money. They'll ruin the name of the precious formula. What should you do? Give me your hand. Ah! I'll cut you off. From now on, you can't practice medicine. From now on Don't talk about Hyakusogan's prescription. Find another job Little Y-Head Little girl I'll remember you This is the best ginseng It's the best ginseng in the store. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for making Ms. Qiao Miss Qiao and Mr. Qin to make fun of us today. It's all right. It's just that it's not as potent as it should be. It'll take a little longer. Let's go. I've heard that this place Is the best TCM center in the country Do you want these two ginsengs? Forget it. I must have overthought it Mr. Qin How long are you going to follow me? Are you sure you want to chase me? That's right. Isn't it obvious enough? I'm just an ordinary person I'm just a normal person who wants to live a quiet life. I don't 't want to get involved I don't want to get involved with your mysterious families. IQ is superb. Ordinary people who also know medicine Qiao Ying As far as I know The Thirteen Stitches of the Phoenix There's only one person in the world who knows them It's a coincidence I've seen that person before She's the same age as you She's as pretty as you She even has a similar name. Or maybe You've changed your face. Is that right? Is that you, Bloodshot? I've been looking for you. Mr. Qin. Please respect yourself. In your capacity. I'm just an ordinary college girl These are just coincidences There aren't that many coincidences in the world Bloodshot What's the relationship between you two? What is the relationship between you two? Hug Sose Maybe I'm being rude. It's just that you and her You really look like her. What Mr . Qin means is. Mr. Qin is saying that I have the potential to be a body double. That's right Many of you luxury CEOs Many of you have this kind of fetish No, they don't You've got it all wrong. Hey! Let's just forget about today's incident Mr. Qin Let's leave it at that. Master San. You're not going after her? I offended her. She's a person like that. I don't think she likes to be pestered. Let's go. Bitch! You ruined everything for me. I won't let you get away with it either. Watch out! Qin Han-yue! Third Master! Call the police! Qin Han-yue! Take me back to Lan Shan Villa. Hey, you! Still pretending? You're still awake? These abs. It feels good. If you don't wake up I'll stab you with a needle. Unconscionable I was trying to save you from getting hurt. You still want to stab me with a needle? If you hadn't rushed out so early. I could have subdued him faster. The wound hurts. Aigoo! Don't go! Qiao Ying Thank you for saving me again. For saving me again. Mr . Qin. How much do I resemble her? How much does she fascinate you? You're mistaken I have no intention whatsoever I didn't mean to use you as a substitute. It's just that seeing you Reminds me of that &quot;Thirteen Stitches of the Phoenix&quot; They say it's the only thing in the world Can save my father's life What kind of disease is this? Even Old Man Ming can't do anything about it When I watched you perform the stitches today. I was really excited I think my father's life can be saved What did you say? He's in critical condition. Grandpa! Sheng. It seems that the old man He's really dying this time. The head of the Qin family. Will soon be ours. As long as he's alive . Third Uncle's position as Head of the Qin Family will be untouchable. But it's clear I'm the eldest grandson of the Qin family He's only 8 years older than me The head of the Qin family Should have been handed over to me a long time ago. Dad! Han Yue. You're here. Come and see your father for the last time. Shut up! My father's not dead yet. He's not sick. He's poisoned. Can it be cured? I don't want to reveal my identity. But we can't just let him die. I'm pretty sure. I'm sure of it. What are you doing? Saving someone Qin Han Yue She's not your mistress, is she? You brought your mistress here to cause trouble? What's your intention? Can I hit someone? Dad! Dad! Dad! You're awake. What's going on here? Get outta here! Who's this girl? Oh, I am. Ah Yue. You're finally getting the hang of it. This is my daughter-in-law.

Who the hell are you? Qin Han Yue You're playing with fire No one has ever dared to do this Call me by my name Except my father You're the first I told you. I'm Joe Shadow. I'm not anyone else. I know that. That man's name was Bloodshot. The name is very similar to yours. The No. 1 female agent in the world. Recognized as a genius. Not only is her face and intelligence top-notch. She's also a drug addict. She's both a murderous demon And an angel of mercy. She saved my life. I want to find her. I just want to thank her in person. What does that have to do with me? Qiao Ying I never thought of you as a double. I've seen her. You're not like her. You have your family. You have a life . I've seen it all with my own eyes. So? I'm not one of those people I'm not the kind of person I'm not the kind of person who's going to comfort myself with fantasies of perfection. I only care about what I saw with my own eyes. I hear it with my own ears. Real people that I can touch. Like the one who's here with me right now. The real you. I've been trying you so many times. It's my fault. I'm sorry. I promise it won't happen again. So Can you give me another chance? You want me to forgive you? It's not that easy Mr. Qin It's up to you to show me what you can do next. Isn't this Mr. Qin's car? Hey! Mr. Qin. I don't want to be I don't want to be famous on the first day of school. I'll tell you what. Then give me your cell phone Why? I want to ask for your forgiveness. I want to woo you. Of course you have to be sincere. My cell phone is on 24 hours a day. If you're in trouble in Jiangcheng. Call me anytime Since we met. It seems like I'm the one who's been saving your ass. By calling you. I'd have solved the problem myself. You. You'd better take good care of yourself. Thank you for your concern, Ms. Qiao . I'll follow the doctor's advice. And you don't have to call me &quot;Third Master&quot; You don't have to call me &quot;Third Master&quot; like them. Just call me Qin Han Yue. Or Call me Han Yue. I can do that too. I'm fine. Let's go. Who is she? Why did she get out of Mr. Qin's car? Let's go, Third Master. Wait a little longer. Third Master. Since you're courting Ms. Qiao. Why don't you tell her who you really are? In terms of strength. Except for the mysterious Miss Bloodshot. No one can compete with you. I don't think anyone would refuse this offer. No, no, no, no, no. She's different. I don't know her yet. But I think I don't think she cares about these things. What would Ms. Jo care about? I don't know. But at least she gave me A chance to get to know her. Maybe soon. I'll find out Qingbei University is so big It takes half a day to find an apartment . Stop! I told you to stop, didn't you hear me? Who are you? My name is Su Qingyu. If you know Qin Han Yue You should know my name. You're quite pretty, aren't you? I don't know you. Get out of my way. Hey! Don't rush off. Since you don't know me. Don't you want to know who I am? Let go of me. It's my first day at school . I don't want to fight. First day at school. What a novelty. You can't just come and go to college. You can leave whenever you want? You didn't beg Brother Qin To get you here, right? Tell me. How hard did you work on him? Stop right there. I don't believe you After you know who I am. You still have the guts to be so rude to me. Then tell me What's your identity? I'm Qin Han Yue's I'm his fiancee. Oh! It's none of my business. Hey! Isn't that our Miss Su? She's about to be promoted to Mrs. Qin But that classmate I've never seen him before. He dares to mess with Su's schoolgirl You really don't know what you're doing. Did you hear that? Mr. Qin will only marry me. I know that. As the future head of the Qin family. I'm sure I'll meet many Like you. You're the one who wants to seduce Qin Han-yue. And become a phoenix But I'm warning you You should die before it's too late. Otherwise you'll die an ugly death. I see. You' re treating yourself as the boss. You're treating me like a mistress Hey, Qin Han-yue! Your first wife? Oh, no! Your fiancee She's here to give me a hard time. Get over here and take care of it. There's a limit to my patience. Fiancee? It's impossible You want to sue You don't know how busy Brother Qin is every day And you think he's going to take care of you? Really? I think he's quite busy He's always clinging to me You? He's just trying to get a fresh start. A girl like you, who doesn't know what she's doing. Don't think he'll fall in love with you. What's going on? Soo Da Hwa has met her rival. Hey! I just saw this girl Getting out of the Qin family's car. Is Mr. Qin in love with someone else? Is it possible that the engagement between the Qin family and Su family's engagement has been canceled? The engagement between the Qin and Su families will not be canceled. In Jiangcheng, there's no one else who's good enough for the Qin family. Only the Su family is worthy of the Qin family. This woman is nothing more than vanity A shameless third party How dare you hit me? You 're the one who hit me I'll kill you! My God Isn't that Jiangcheng That's Mr. Qin, the man you never see and don't hear from. How could she? She actually called Mr. Qin? How are you? Are you all right? Qin Han-yue. Explain yourself You have a fiancee and you 're still messing with me? You think you'll live too long? How dare she call Master Qin by his first name? Talking to Master Qin like that? How dare you? Who are you? What's going on? Isn't he married to Su Qingyu? The second daughter of the Su family in Jiangcheng. Su Qingyu? When did I have an engagement with you? Explain yourself! Have you forgotten? When Auntie Qin was alive. When Auntie Qin was alive. I remember the engagement It was to be with your Miss Su. The Su family's eldest daughter She died a long time ago The engagement is no longer valid What's the matter? Who told you about the transfer? Me? Me? Besides, my mother has been dead for 10 years. Even if he were alive. He would have respected my choice. I'm the one who decides who I'm going to be with. But, no. There is no but. I don't know what kind of rumors I don't know what kind of rumors you're spreading. I have nothing to do with you. I'm telling you The Su family and the Qin family Will never have anything to do with each other again Do you understand? Let's go So the engagement was just Su Qingyue's words. How dare you rumor about Mr. Qin? How dare you? That's right. No wonder. Mr. Qin has never been with her. He's never been with her. So Master Qin Doesn't even know about it. Shut up! Anyone of you who dares to tell the truth today The Su family We will not spare him. I don't know what you did I don't know how you charmed Master Qin. But I won't let you get away with it. This house is too small. And it's a stairwell. Why don't I buy you a big house I'll buy you a big house in the neighborhood. If you don't have money to spend, go to charity. I think this is a nice place. And it's convenient for classes. Do you still need to take classes? I'm teaching at the medical school. And Principal Zhang has arranged my I've arranged my class schedule. Oh, right, right, right. I forgot. That Ms. Su is quite pretty You just made her lose face. Do you want to give up? I swear. I have nothing to do with her As for the engagement. That's a long time ago . I didn't think she'd talk about it at school. That she would publicize it like that. I guess she got a lot of favors from the Qin family's name She must have gotten a lot of favors from the Qin family's name Why are you so nervous? It's like I'm checking up on you. Because I'm serious about you So I don't want you to get the wrong idea Hiss What's wrong with you? Probably When I was moving the suitcase, the wound opened up. What's on your mind? I'm thinking. I wish this moment was forever. Can I kiss you? I thought you'd at least Slap me in the face. If you don't leave. I'll think about it. As you wish. Then you get some rest. I'll leave you alone. By the way It's Principal Zhang's birthday banquet in a few days. He'd like you to come. I see. Would you like to come with me ? Depends on your mood. Nonsense. Originally, the Qin family was concerned about the young lady. What happened the other day We saved face for the Su family We've never taken the initiative To break off the engagement But you You made a big deal out of it. You've depleted what's left of our friendship. It's all gone to waste . But that woman was too much. My father never hit me when I was growing up. Even if she'd been more outrageous. She's still Mr. Qin's woman. When he gets tired of her. He'll still throw her away. No matter what. Go apologize to her. The Qin family connection. Can't be broken. You, sir? Dad Don't be angry. I'll teach Qingyu a good lesson. I'll take care of this. If it wasn't for the marriage contract If it wasn't for the marriage contract. We could rely on the Qin family The Su family would have no place in Jiangcheng There would be no place for the Su Family in Jiangcheng. If Big Brother's child was still alive If the Su family's eldest daughter is still alive The engagement might have come true What a sin! Now the world thinks Miss Su is dead. But we know it ourselves. This child She's not dead. She's missing. Brother and sister-in -law They're both suffering. It's all my fault. It's my fault and your mom's. We were so against this marriage. Don't worry, Dad. I will always I will always try to find them. Whether alive or dead. I'll give Big Brother an explanation. I'm sorry, Boss. Now about the engagement. Into this way It's retribution. Don't blame yourself. In a few days. Principal Zhang's birthday banquet. I'll bring Qingyu to say goodbye to Mr. Qin. I'll bring Qingyu to say goodbye to Mr. Qin. To retain our Su family's And the Qin family. I remember three years ago.

Take this piece of jade for me. Forty million dollars. Oh! Do you really think Mr. Qin is your ATM? I'll pay 55 million. 60 million. Qiao Ying You're asking for it here. If you can't come up with the money. You'll have to sell your body to pay off your debts I'll offer 80 million. When you ask Mr. Qin for money. He'll see you for what you really are. You're a gold digger. Since Ms. Su wants it. Why don't you go wrap it up for Ms. Su? What do you mean? The highest bidder wins. You've won 80 million dollars Take the money Qiao Ying, you want me? You can't get that much money. That's right. I went out today I only brought 50 dollars for a taxi You You're all working together to cheat me When did Lin Yuxuan When did you need an actor to pick up the price? This money belongs to your family Why can't you afford it and want to renege? You think everyone is like you How can you pretend to be a rich man when you don't have money? Let me tell you Even if I were to take over the whole store. I, Su Qingyu, won't even frown No one will stop you. I'm sorry. There's a low balance here. Wait for me. Hey, Dad.

My God, that girl is so beautiful. She's a perfect match for Mr. Qin. Didn't you say that Ms. Su is the fiancee of Mr. Qin's fiancee? You're so out of touch. It's all in your head, Ms. Su. A few days ago, Mr. Qin Mr. Qin clarified it in public. It's too embarrassing for Miss Su. Oh, my! What a beautiful couple! I'm glad I waited for you. We're in a hurry. This is a birthday gift for the principal. You're very kind. Oh, yes. This is it. This is too expensive. I can't accept it. It helps you sleep. It's also good for your headaches. I can't use it. Good, good , good. Aiya! The color of this alabaster. It's rare in the world. It's worth at least a few hundred million dollars. To be able to get such a valuable item From the Third Master. It's just a matter of honoring a man with color. Please come inside. I'd like to introduce you all. This is the genius who cracked This is the genius who cracked our forum's math problem. It's her! She's really something, isn't she? She's also the most important guest The most important guest of honor Qiao Ying Good! The math genius on the forum It's really her At present, Qiao Ying Has been treated as a professor Officially become A member of Qingbei University This is the honor of Qingbei University Yes, ma'am. Ms. Su Are you upset with me? Or are you upset with the principal? I wouldn't dare. Yes. Usually, Ms. Su respects the principal She respects the Principal Today at the Lin Yu Xuan She threw away $80 million To buy a birthday gift for Principal Zhang. $80 million? You? Ms. Su didn't give it to you? I think that jade style It's the perfect gift for the Headmaster. What jadeite? Ah, this. I'm so happy to see the principal's grandfather. I was so happy to see you. I forgot about it. Qing-Yu has a heart. This $80 million jade pendant It must be something extraordinary. Ms. Su, you're not being cheated, are you? Depending on the color of the jadeite. It's only worth 30 million dollars. Yes, yes. You won't be cheated, will you? Grandpa, the principal. This jadeite looks ordinary. But I've asked the master of the Putuo Temple. I had it blessed. It can turn bad luck into good. So that's how it is. Qing-Yu's favor has come true. I'm happy too Lin Yuxuan got the money Principal Zhang got the birthday gift And I got to watch the show Only Su Qingyue's world was hurt It's done What are you laughing at? I'm laughing at someone's failure to steal a chicken He lost his wife and his army Ting! What? Principal Zhang. What happened? The school has hired A gold medal lawyer from abroad To give a lecture at the school. We've spent money on publicity. But the lawyer had a car accident. He's in critical condition right now. It's a waste of money, isn't it? What if there's an accident? Grandpa, the principal. What's so difficult about it? The Su family has connections abroad. We can just hire another one. It's not as simple as you think. This gold-medal lawyer is of a very high caliber. He's from a famous overseas Chinese law firm. Ching Xin Law Firm It took me half a year To apply for this opportunity This opportunity Cheng Xin Law Firm. Isn't this owned by Cheng Jin Yan? That's easy. Just get Cheng Jin-yin here. That's not very practical, is it? You said you'd find him. Who is he? Mr. Qiao, don't be ridiculous! Qiao Ying! Do you want to hear what you're saying? How hard is it to get him to come and give a lecture? Cheng Jin-yin is a genius lawyer Cheng Jin-yin is a world-renowned lawyer. His fees alone cost eight figures. Do you know how much it costs Do you know how much it costs to hire him to give a lecture? We can't even afford to sell Qingbei University. That's right. I told you I'll do anything you want But I can't do this. Back then, I wanted to hire him to handle Qin Group's legal affairs But he refused. You don't need to hire him I'll just make a phone call I'll just call him and ask him to come over Oh! You think you're so honorable? You can just call him and have him come. A country bumpkin is a country bumpkin. You've got a lot of nerve. Watch your mouth. You're a country bumpkin. Why are you pretending? Grandpa, the principal. Don't listen to her. She's just a math problem solver How does she know about Mr. Cheng? What's his status? What if I really get him here? What if you can really get Cheng Jin-yin Cheng Jinyan to give a lecture? Don't say lecture. Even if you invite him here. I'd kneel down and ask you for more. You don't deserve it. I think you can't do it. If you can't do it, don't talk big. What I mean is If we're going to gamble Then let's change the bet to something more realistic. Qiao Ying, you 're asking for death! All right, all right. The school can solve this You two should stop arguing You're both classmates Don't hurt our relationship No, Mr. Principal. Since Qiao Ying is so arrogant. I'll let she knows the consequences I didn't want to be at Principal's birthday banquet. I didn't want to get involved with you But you insist on targeting me Then I must go through with it You're really addicted to pretending, Qiao Ying. Fine, I'll bet whatever you want But I'm afraid you'll lose the bet You won't honor your bet I'll go straight to 1 billion dollars One billion? Why can't you get it? Isn't the Su family relying on the marriage contract with the Qin family. They've gotten a lot of favors And made a lot of money? You're overthinking it. You're overthinking it. It's only 1 billion dollars That's nothing. Not to mention. I don't believe you can do it. Don't regret it. But if you lose. You'll learn to crawl in front of the whole school. Learn to crawl like a dog. Crawl like a dog! Su Qingyu Don't go too far Brother Qin I just want you to see clearly This woman She doesn't deserve your protection I don't need him to protect me I can do it myself Hello? - Hello? Who is it? It's me. It's you. Ching Kam-yin. I know your phone number. Who dares to talk to you like this? There's only one other person. It's you. But I found out that you're already Yes, it's me I'm at Qingbei University in Jiangcheng Can you come over? I'm in Tokyo. Wait for me, I'll come to you now. I'll be right there. Who'd believe it? You're talking weird. I think you're an actor. Jiangcheng to Tokyo is only four hours away. If you don't believe me. See you in four hours. Mr. Principal. I think the school can prepare To welcome Mr. Ching. Well, well, well. That's great. When did you meet Cheng Jinyan? If you're asking me . I can only say It's just a coincidence. Okay, fine. If you don't want to tell me, then don't. Anyway, you have more than one secret. It's not the only one. We're old friends. Important friends. Old friends. It's about time. I'll go pick him up first. Why don't you follow me this time? It's such an important occasion for an old friend to meet. I thought you wouldn't want me to intrude. And I'm afraid that seeing you together I'd go crazy with jealousy. You know what I'm talking about. Did you see that? It's all over the school forum Qiao Ying made a bet with Su University's top girl. Qiao Ying said. She's going to bring Cheng Jin Yan here. Cheng Jinyan? He's our law faculty's He's the god of our law faculty. So he's alive today? He's not only coming. He's going to give us a lecture. It's heard that Su University's senior student has bet 1 billion dollars On whether Qiao Ying can Can bring him here? Look, that's Qiao Ying No wonder she dares to fight with Su's schoolmarm. Compared to her. Compared to her, I feel that Su's school beauty It's a bit of a misnomer, isn't it? Hey! What's her relationship with Cheng Jin Yan? This way! Cheng Jin-Yin is really here! He's so handsome! Look at me. Have I changed a lot? What's going on here? Rebirth of the soul. It's amazing, isn't it? I'm a lawyer. I'm a committed materialist. Then it looks like your beliefs are crumbling. Well, that's okay. I'm glad you're still alive. Mr . San. What do we do now? Call the Soo family. Tell them to get 1 billion dollars ready. Explain it to me. What's going on here? Dad, what are you doing? I told you to apologize to that girl. And you made a bet with her? Mr. Qin didn't help her either. I don't think there's anything going on between them. Dad, you're just thinking too much. What are you saying? The girl didn't ask Mr. Qin for help. She hired Mr. Cheng herself. She just made a random phone call. Who knows who she was calling? Have you thought about it? Mr. Cheng? Even Mr. Qin Even Mr. Qin couldn't hire him If that girl can hire him. She's even more powerful than Mr. Qin. It's Mr. Qin. He's trying to get in touch with her. I don't know. That's impossible, Dad. I've asked around. That Qiao Ying is just a A country bumpkin from Yunzhou. She has no background at all. You can't bet 1 billion dollars To make a bet? That's a billion dollars Don't worry, Dad. Qiao Ying will definitely lose Just wait and see how she crawls around the school. She'll learn how to crawl in school Nonsense! No, you have to come with me to school Cancel the bet. Why not? I'm not going. She bullied me so much. I'll make her pay. May I ask what you want, Mr. San? Mr. Soo, is the $1 billion ready? Mr. Cheng has arrived at the school What's impossible? How can it be? If Ms. Su doesn't believe me. You can come to the school and see for yourself. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Ms. Su. Miss Su. When will you settle the billions? I thought you were dead. I've already started planning to take revenge on you. It's amazing, isn't it? I think it's amazing too. Let's not talk about the past. How are you now? Are you happy? I've gotten away from all the fighting and killing. It's kind of amazing. So you called me here Just to give a lecture. To get paid for my time. And you get to meet me. What a bargain! Do you want to go to Europe with me? I have an estate in the Aegean. That's not necessary. I have my own friends and family here I'm quite happy here. Friends? Male or female? If you say so. I'm curious. What kind of person Within three months of your rebirth. Within three months of your rebirth, you've come to think of him as a friend. He's just a businessman. A businessman? Didn't you always hate The smell of businessmen? What changed? He smells like copper. It's quite nice. You like it? Why isn't it a question? Intuition. There's a pretty girl at the boss's place. Pretty girl. She's a good drinker. Why don't you have a drink with us? I'm happy. I 'll pay for your drinks tonight. I'll pay for it. Why is she ignoring me? I'm not a bad guy.

The boy didn 't breathe at that time I happened to pick up a girl at the back door of the health center I found a girl I thought No wonder this girl won't kiss me. So she's not my daughter at all Ms. Lin Mr. Qiao , don't worry If you raise Qiao Ying safely You'll be a benefactor to the Su family I was in a hurry I didn't bring that much money There's a hundred million dollars in this card Take it first A hundred million? A hundred million? Shadow. It's you. Xiao Ying This girl Why did she come back at this time? Mr. Qin Qin. Why are you here? I'm here to protect Qiao Ying. Tell me what's going on.

Your mom's name is An Ying She sang in a theater in Yunzhou Back then, my mother Couldn't stand her background She strongly opposed the marriage An Ying was pregnant She was kicked out of the house When my elder brother found out. He became sick with depression. He died within two years I didn't realize the real Qiao Ying She had such a complicated life So your wife is so against it Shadow going back with you Will she be bullied? No, that's fine. After my brother died, the old lady repented. She's been eating fasting and praying to Buddha all day. We've been trying to find the children of my brother and sister-in-law for more than 10 years. We've been trying to find my brother's and sister-in-law's children. That's what she meant. I know the Soo family has wronged you. But I promise When we get home. I'll do my best to make it up to you. Who said I'm going back with you? Xiao Ying! You mean Your Su drove family my mom away. You forced my father to die. And now you want me to go back to recognize my ancestors? Dream on! I know you don't have much affection for the Soo family And you and Ching-yu You have some problems with Qingyu.

But Ms. Lee Don't worry Whether the child returns to the Su family or not We will repay you well Repay you Repay them both For mistreating me all these years? Abuse? Not at all. She's been naughty since she was a kid. Her father and I used to beat her It's normal to scold her. This is clearly education. How can it be abuse? You didn't do your research before you left home.

Su Qing-Yu Tell them You told me to do this . I don't want to go to jail Do you have any more explanations for me, Su Qingyu? Brother Qin What they say on the forum is true Qiao Ying used to be fat Ugly She did it for you I don't know what she did for you She's done some shameful things for you Don't be fooled by her Do you think I'm stupid? What you can find out The Qin family can't find out You must have something on her You must have something on her, right? Otherwise She's just a wild girl from the countryside Why do you keep her like this? To keep her? Please understand Su Qinghua I'm willing to spend money for Ms. Qiao But opportunities are rare Speaking of support I very much hope that Ms. Qiao Can give me a chance I can put down my manhood To be her canary Did I hear you right? Mr. Qin is the one who takes the initiative. In other words. The head of the Qin family, the most powerful family in Jiangcheng. He voluntarily put himself down to pursue Qiao Ying. That's right. I'm the one who voluntarily put down my position Dad, you hit me Do you know what you've done? What have you done? I . ... Mr. Su I'm sure you've learned the whole story You already know Mr. Qin, Ms. Qiao. I never thought Qingyu She could do such a thing Dad, what are you doing? Do you know what's going on? Ms. Qiao Is your uncle's Miss Qiao is your uncle's long-lost daughter. She's your sister. She's the eldest daughter of the Soo family. What's that? Dad, what are you talking about? It's a bad luck for the family. What? Qiao Ying is the Su family's The long-lost young lady of the Su family The Su family is so lucky, right? Qiao Ying is the Su family's eldest daughter Doesn't the Su family have only one daughter? What kind of complicated family feud is this? Now that everyone's here How should we handle this? Tell me The survival of the Su family is at stake. I advise you to think carefully before you speak Ms. Qiao. This is my responsibility I didn't control her properly It's up to you to decide what to do. I'll do whatever you say. I'll do whatever you say. I just ask that you don't hate this family. I'm not interested in becoming the Su family's first lady. I'm not interested at all And you're not qualified To make me not hate the Soo family What are you doing here? This isn't the Su family. She eats fasting all day long. Doesn't come out of the door or leave the house Old lady? How come she's here? Grandma, what are you doing here? You look like her. It's a perfect resemblance. It's your brother's child. Look at his eyes and eyebrows. It looks exactly like your brother. Hey, kid. I'm your grandmother. Oh! You're the one who forced my parents to die. It was you! Qiao Ying is admitting that she is Su family Didn't the young master of the Su family die of illness He didn't leave behind any children Is there another reason for Mr. Su's death? No wonder Mrs. Su She burns incense and worships Buddha every day. She must have done something wrong. Yes, she did. My child. I'm sorry. But now Your parents are gone. I wish you could come back The Su family will make it up to you. No matter what. Will it bring back a human life ? Qiao Ying I know that The past can't be changed anymore. No matter what. We can't make it up to you. But as long as you say We'll do everything we can to make it up to you. My child. If you hate me I'll get down on my knees I'll apologize to you, okay? I apologize to you, Grandma. Mom! - Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! This is too much. You're really kneeling! No matter what. Mrs. Su is the senior after all. How can Qiao Ying accept such a big gift? Yes, Qiao Ying has gone too far That's right Qiao Ying! Didn't you hear what everyone said? Grandma's the senior after all You took a knee from her like that? Aren't you afraid of losing your life? She's your senior She's not my senior. Let her kneel if she wants to. I didn't force her. As for what they said. It's just some kind of moral abduction. You think I care? They're here to see what's going on. How can they come for nothing? The bigger the party, the better. Okay. I get it. You just hate me, don 't you? I'll apologize to you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't know You're my uncle's daughter. If you hold a grudge against me. You can yell at me. Don't bully my grandma I bullied her Do you want to tell me What happened 20 years ago? Let's hear it Who really bullied who Qiao Our Su family? We're one of the most prestigious families in Jiangcheng. Let's talk about this at home Is this the sincerity of your Su family Sincerity to apologize? Qiao Ying. I've apologized to you What else do you want? What do I want? I want her to tell the truth about what happened back then What did your Su family do? What did you say to the public? Since you're apologizing. You must have some sincerity, right? If you think I went too far I was wrong Then I'll go back to the Su family with you willingly. Qiao Ying, don' t go too far OK! I'll say it OK! I say! Mom, but We've come to this point. I can't hide it anymore. It's all my fault. Twenty years ago. I was the one who opposed Su Yu and An Ying's marriage. That's why they were forced to separate. An Ying was pregnant with a child and disappeared. Su Yu. He was suffering from depression. He jumped to his death. Didn't you say that? Auntie had a difficult labor. The mother and daughter died. That's why uncle became depressed? Su Qingyu You still don't understand These grandiose words They're just a cover-up To tell outsiders. After Yu's departure. I finally realized. There's nothing left to lose. What's the point of me opposing it? What's the point? I prayed every day. I hope one day I can find An Ying and that child To make up for them But according to my investigation An Ying's health has always been very weak When she was pregnant. When you kicked her out of the house. She was even sick and in great danger As for your prayers day and night I'm afraid it's not because of your guilt For breaking up this couple. Nor did you want to find An Ying and the child. It's because I know An Ying will definitely die if she goes out. If she dies twice. Then you're the murderer. Mom! - Grandma! Grandma! Mrs. Su. You don't really want me back. You just want to atone for your sins. To make yourself feel better That's why You never deserve to be forgiven Do you know why the Su family has fallen Do you know why the Su family has fallen to such a state? It's because you're too arrogant. You think you can do whatever you want just because you're rich You looked down on An Ying's background as an actress You kicked her out of the house. Su Qingyu also despised my background. That's why she made things difficult for me That's why I'm in this situation today. It's the cycle of karma You brought this on yourselves I've done my research The Su family's wealth. Su Yu earned most of it. But it was hard for him to get married. He wanted to get married. You forced him to die. According to inheritance law. The Su family's assets Qiao Ying should inherit it But it doesn't matter I' ll bankrupt the Su family I'll give it to Qiao Ying It's the same I'm not interested in the Su family's property Qiao Ying I was wrong The Su family can't go bankrupt I'll do anything you want Anything! That's right ! Anything. Do you know there's an acupressure point It can make a person mute. You're such a liar. You like to spread rumors. Then for the rest of your life You'll be mute for the rest of your life. I promise. I promise It's our Su family that has wronged you I'll transfer all my assets I'll transfer all my assets to you. Please Leave me some money Let us Leave Jiangcheng to live Let's go Qiaoyi, eat If it's not enough, ask Qin to have some more Qin Mr. Qin. You eat first. Why are you so afraid of me? Are you afraid I'll eat you? It's not polite to call you Third Master. Call me brother-in-law. Eat your food. It's boring to just eat. I need to bond with my brother. You want to be my brother-in-law? Isn't it obvious? My sister has been in our family since she was a child. She's suffered a lot. She's suffered a lot. Can you promise to be good to her all the time? I can give my life I can promise you that. So tell me quickly What does your sister like? What she hates. I don't know. You've been together for years. You must know. I feel that she's changed a lot. She doesn't seem like the person she was before. Sis. Is this your place? Yes, it is. It's too big. It's okay . It's not that big. No, it's not. It's not as big as the one I gave your sister. I gave your sister. It's not even close. Yee. I'll treat your leg later. It's going to be very painful. Can you bear it? As long as I can become normal. I'll do anything. Yeah, I'll do that. The longer it takes, the better. You have to tell me when you can't stand it anymore. Yes, ma'am. Sis . I've reached my limit. The muscle contraction isn't too bad. You'll feel it in a minute. I can feel it. Sis. I can really feel my leg. My leg's healed. Sis. Sis. I' m not crippled anymore. So Qiao Ying, you're in Jiangcheng You're doing so well in Jiangcheng And Qiao Yi Both surnamed Qiao Why can't I get anything? Why? Hey! Hey! Hey! Look at the size of your villa It's getting late. Why don't you consider taking me in? We're both adults. And I'm a girl Master Qin Should know better than I do The importance of reputation, right? I think we're all adults Ms . Qiao is also a girl Mr. Cheng should know better than me The importance of reputation, right? Mr. Qin is a bit too much. Isn't that too much? Besides, I've just said Shadow and I We've always been on the same page Qiao Ying When can we also We can be the same Don't move! Someone's here. Maybe they're here to trouble me. The Qin family's reputation precedes us. Whoever it is I want him to let his guard down Lure him into a fight Aah! Sis. What's going on? Stop chasing him. He hurt his hand. With this description. I'm sure I can find him. I'm sure I can find him. I'll leave the rest to you. Do you think this person Is he the same as the man who The ones who poisoned my father? The same people who poisoned my father? I can't tell. If it is There must be a mole in the Qin family It's been a long time since the Qin family It's been a long time since we've cleaned it up. This is a good opportunity to do so. Let's go! Rubbish! I can't believe he didn't get it If Qin Han-yue doesn't die The Qin family will never belong to me And that damn Qiao Ying! She's been helping Qin Han-yue many times. She's been a bad influence on me. Young master Qin. You hate Qiao Ying too? Who are you? I'm Qiao Ying's sister. Sister? What do you want? Young master Qin The enemy of my enemy Is a friend I think We can work together Didn't I tell you not to come to me? But Mr. Qin It's no longer safe outside I had no choice but to come to you I've heard that Third Master has begun He's screening the Qin family. You have to protect me. Of course I'll protect you. Otherwise, I won't be able to live either. Mr. Qin. The Third Master has suddenly arrived. Get out of here! It's too late. The Third Master will be at the door soon. Uncle San What are you doing here? Give me the information on this list. Uncle San It's for the Qin Group. Qin Group's internal self-check. Didn't it end half a year ago? Why are we doing it again? Uncle San. What's going on? It's nothing. Ai! Uncle San. What's wrong? Hey! Uncle San! What's wrong? Qin Sheng. I know the head of the Qin family. You've wanted it for a long time. But do you know why Why father he didn't pass it on to you? Because I'm still young. I wasn't capable enough. But I know. That's not what you think. When I became the head of the family. My father wanted to transfer all the family assets Into my name. I insisted I insisted on leaving this subsidiary to you. It's been two years and four months since then. You've lost a total of 8 billion dollars. I gave you a chance to prove yourself. It's a pity. You don't have the ability to succeed the company. Uncle San taught you a lesson. That's why I'm telling you, Qin Sheng. Don't think about what you can't have And A man's heart is not enough for a snake to swallow an elephant. You've come this far. You still won't talk? I'll tell you. Mr. Qin, I'll tell you. It's Mr. Qin. No! Qin Sheng told me to do it. He told you to kill me. He's so stupid. Qin Sheng said. &quot;Kill the girl next to you. The girl next to you. Kill her. It'll be easier to deal with you. Qin Sheng. Shadow ! Help me! Help me! Did you send me a message from Dad's cell phone? It's me. Sister! Don't go. I had no choice.

So what should we do? This. You should stab the eye and bamboo points. And the three acupuncture points, right? But these three points are just symptoms. There's a shortcut. Oh! The big point in the abdomen. Three needles at the same time Three inches and three minutes deep. It's perfect. This is very dangerous. I wouldn't dare. I told you he wouldn't dare. Oops!

What's wrong with it? The information was wrong. I'm fine. My eyes. I don't need that herb. Take care of Qiao Ying for me. I'll ask around. Master San. The information is absolutely correct This could only be a temporary decision by the organizers It's an impromptu decision. Mr. Qin. I'm not ashamed to say Last night, the Yellow Clover plant Was Stolen? Master Qin I didn't know the auction item It was so important to you . If I had known. I would have protected it. Three days at the most. I'll find it for you. I'll bring it to you with respect. Uncle San. I heard you're looking for a Chinese herb The Chinese herb called &quot;Yellow Cracker&quot;. It's rumored to be extinct soon. But coincidentally. I have one right here. You didn't steal it, did you? Uncle San. Don't be so harsh. But if you don't come over I'm not sure how long it will live. Uncle San. You can't be weak. You taught me that. Three days. Mr. San. Three days is the limit. When we catch that man. We must punish him severely. Look, Third Master. Shut up! What's going on? It's been so long. Don't worry. I'll bring it back properly. Get your hands off me! Uncle San came so quickly. It seems that this yellow dock is really important to you. It's really important to you. Or maybe You really care about that Qiao Ying You really care about her. Stop it! Qin Sheng! You know I hate Betrayal and threats You've captured my men. Is that right? Yes, I did. Then I won't pretend anymore. Uncle San You know that. You can't have two tigers on the same mountain. You're getting old. It's time to step aside Ah You don't have to make excuses What you want is not the Qin family. You want power. You want to know what it's like You want to know what it's like to be on top. So what? I'm the eldest grandson of the Qin family. All of this should have belonged to me in the first place. But why did Grandpa give birth to you? You're only 8 years older than me But with this difference of 8 years You took away the money and power Money and power that should have belonged to me You took it all away from me It's not that I can't give you power and money But can you hold on to it? How long can you hold it? I don't care I don't care about the survival of the Qin family The future of the group It's none of my business. With this money. I can spend it for 10 lifetimes. But you only have one life to live I told you. You shouldn't think about what you can't have. You can't have what you can't have. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! I'm sick of you talking to me like that. Treating me like a child. Telling me what I should and shouldn't have. You tell me what I'm entitled to. That's why you did everything you could. To poison my father. You tried to kill me! Qin Sheng! I think you're out of your mind So what? Anyway, now You've got a soft underbelly. Uncle San You told me Don't be fooled by women. Now you're going to fall for that woman. You're going to fall into that woman's hands too. What do you want? I want you to Kneel down. It seems that Uncle San Still can 't let go of his dignity Lay down your honor for that woman. But you don't seem to know one thing. This medicine is important. But it's not essential It's you who You exposed your ambition for it. It's really stupid. Ai . She told you that. This medicine is dispensable. But think about it, Uncle San. It's such an amazing thing. It must be unique. How can it be dispensable? Ah! She likes you very much. How do you know? Did she say that so you wouldn't worry? That's why she said that. Uncle San. Do you want to bet? Aah! Stop it! Stop it! Heh Qiao Ying I said I would protect you with my life. This time I don 't dare to gamble This is the transfer agreement of the Qin Group Sign it This Yellow Cracked Flaxseed Is yours Ah! Oh, yes. There's also a contract for the severance of kinship. Uncle San. I'm afraid you won't be able to eat when you're old. What if in the future Ask me to support you in your old age, what should I do? Ha ha ha! Mr. San. You've done so much for me. It's been a hard day's work. What are you doing here? I'm about to get my hands on the yellow dock. I've received your gesture. You don't have to go through all this trouble. Don't move. Don't come any closer. One more step forward. I'll destroy it. Aren't you blind? Yes, I am. I am blind. I know you're good. But now you're blind. Even if I destroy this plant in front of you. I'll destroy this yellow dock in front of you. What can you do? Stop it! Qin Han-yue! You're so funny. This is the funniest joke I've heard this year This is the funniest joke I've heard this year I'm blind I'm not a cripple If he wasn't your nephew. I'd like to try that knife I just bought on him. The knife I just bought. I didn't want to tell you any of this. What happened? And then the whole show. Sacrifice yourself Sacrificing myself to save my lover. At least I lied to him first. To get the herb. As for this contract I can turn it into a scrap of paper anytime I can turn it into a piece of paper anytime I want. Let's go. It can't go to waste. You've gone to great lengths You've gone to great lengths to preserve this yellow dock I'll let Qin Yan take care of it here Qin Sheng said Kill the girl next to you The girl next to you Kill her It'll be easier to deal with you. It's time to let Qin Yan Take care of him I'm not the one who said Do you two need to be so hostile? I need a needle. Uh-oh. All right, come on back. How'd it go? Are you done? No light for three days. Then you'll be cured. For the time being. I won't go back for a while. I won't worry until you're completely cured Qiao Ying I'll use the whole city as a bride price Will you marry me? What's wrong with you? I thought you wouldn't cry Are you sure you want to? Yes, I am. No matter what happens. I don't want to change my mind. I want to love your true soul And if you decide I'll tell you everything about me Qin Han Yue I have a gift for you too Really? A few years ago. An Italian priest gave it to me. He said that in my past life. I was a vampire. In this life, I was born a human. If I don't find my patron saint. I'd die young. Maybe he's right. But then again, maybe he's not. God didn't want me. So he gave me a chance. Qin Han-yue. Will you be my guardian? I'll be your guardian forever. Until death do us part. My best man . That's right. The summer after your senior year. Summer's my favorite time. That's good. Hey, hey, hey. How are you doing at your new school? I hear it's a faster pace in Jiangcheng. I can get used to it. Don't worry about me. Okay. Then you can study at ease. If there's anything you don't know, remember to ask me. Did you find Qiao Lingling? Not yet. That's strange Since she hasn't left Jiangcheng She must be on the move Why is there no trace of her? I've been thinking about it for the past two days. I've been thinking Is the Qin family's tactics They've overestimated her But I have a feeling She'll definitely start with Qiaoyi Speaking of Qiaoyi He even called me today He told me that I don't have to do anything special To protect him Qiaoyi has too much pride He doesn't like to be a maverick But this is an opportunity Even if Qiao Lingling captures Qiao Yi. I'll be the ultimate target She won't do anything to Qiaoyi But you tell me If I use Qiao Yi to catch her Will Qiao Yi be angry? As expected Hey, kid! Let me tell you something. We' re all adults here What about today? Someone paid me I'm here to screw you. What's the matter? You don't have a bodyguard today? Brother Biao. I guess he can't afford a bodyguard. Biao, I've asked around. He's from Yunzhou. He's probably from a rich family. To send this kid to Jiangcheng. To send this kid to Jiangcheng. Let me tell you something. I hate people like you the most You were not born in Jiangcheng Instead, you came to Jiangcheng to enjoy Our honor and wealth Ah Don't you want to show your face? I came to Jiangcheng on my own merit I came to Jiangcheng It's you guys Do not think To your so-called locals Shame on you so-called locals? If you have the guts, say it again. He said you're a disgrace. Do you understand? Sis. Who are you guys? Tell me so I can hit you hard. My father. But Jiangcheng The famous Lin Beifeng These two A Wang family Do you dare to mess with them? Then tomorrow A man named Qin will tell you Your three families are bankrupt What Qin? Do you really think we're scared? It's okay if you don't believe me Just don't cry when the time comes I think you're the ones who should cry. A big shot like Mr. Qin. He's not going to allow anyone out there To use his name to do things outside Believe it or not, I I'll call him directly Expose you Oh, you have his phone number I've got his phone number. Our Wei family We're the superstore of the Qin Group We've been the cold chain supplier for years My father wanted to get Mr. Qin's phone number It wouldn't take him a minute. It's true. Qin Han-yue is better with his face. Brother Biao. We don't need to be afraid of her. She's just a girl. Let's tie her up . Let's send her to Mr. Qin to claim the credit. Go! You're so young and impetuous. Finally, I can save a beauty for once. Ah Ying Who are you? Didn't you say you knew me just now? But now you don't recognize me Master San, I'm here too. Leave the money at the door. Master Qin is inside. It's not human blood. I'll be damned if I don't lock us in here. Qiao Ying, Qiao Ying. I didn't realize you still think so highly of yourself. You have no one in your sight Where's Mr. Qin? Ha ha ha! I synthesized that video with my computer. I didn't think I could fool you guys I'm afraid you couldn't do it yourself That's right. Of course I had help. Who was it? You can't imagine. He's a fat, ugly old man. Used to run a scam in northern Maine. He taught me all these tricks. You taught me? Of course he did. The price I paid was To be his bed partner Ting. But that's okay. As long as I can get the money What's dignity? I'm afraid I'll have to let you down Qiao Lingling That bank card at the door is empty. You may want to take advantage You might want to take advantage of the fact that we're locked up in here. Take the money and go But you're wrong, Joe Ling Ling As long as you show up You won't be able to leave Mr. Qin! Mr. Qin Tell me Who sent you to target Qiao Yi? No one. No one sent us. Please forgive us, Mr. Qin. We won't dare to do it again. Qiao Lingling didn't send you here. Master Qin, we won't dare again. I think it's just an ordinary A student bullying incident. I was overthinking it. Are you sure this woman didn't Did she send you here? I've seen this before Isn't this Zhang Ling? Zhang Ling? She told me This Qiao Yi is just a He's just an ordinary kid If he scares him hard enough. He'll probably get away with it That's right. It's really her. I'll use Joey to catch her. I used Joey to get her. I didn't expect her to She's doing it to us. What does she want? She wants to save us Bring 50,000 dollars to Xishan Cold Storage Qin Yan Check it out right away Where is the old man? We can't rely on Qiao Lingling alone It's impossible to catch the Master Think about it from another angle Is she throwing herself into the net? The Xishan cold storage facility has been abandoned for years. How did she find it? We'll find out when we go there You lied to me, Qiao Ying In fact, you want money It's not that I can't give it to you You just have to promise not to pester me again I can give you money It's too late, Qiao Ying I don't want the money I just want you to die Qiao Lingling Calm down I forgot to tell you, Qiao Ying Do you know what that man is? What else? He's the owner of Xishan Cold Storage He slept with me So he promised to help me reopen the cold storage Joyce This is what I want to give you The biggest gift I've ever given you Haha Qiao Ying Aren't your husband and wife? Then let's go to hell for a reunion. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. She's blocking the signal. Put this on first This place has been abandoned for a long time. The seal should be very bad. I'll go with you. I'll go with you. Qin Han-yue. We're going to lose temperature Don't be afraid. You'll be fine. I have a lower body fat percentage than you I'll probably die before you Don't say that. I'll get you out of here Qin Han-yue Maybe the priest was right I have too much blood on my hands. I'm not destined to die well. Maybe. Qin Han-yue. I 'm the one who put you in harm's way. I broke in here on my own. I did everything of my own free will. Qiao Ying If I can die now. In exchange for your life I'd be happy to do so I 'm sorry Don't say anything yet. Keep your strength up. We'll be saved. I have to tell you something. Qin Han-yue. In fact, we've met before in our previous lives. Do you still remember The kidnapping. Ten million dollars So that I could save your life. Bloodshot. That's right. I am Bloodshot. Do you know that? The first time we met. What I thought when I saw your face. What did you think? I was thinking My future husband Must be at least as handsome as you I'd consider having a child with him. But I never thought I'd die before my wish came true But God gave me another chance My soul was reborn into a girl A girl named Qiao Ying I didn't expect We meet again in this life No wonder I've always felt We have a sense of deja vu So we've met before Qin Han Yue In this life I've met you Is my greatest fortune Qiao Ying You are also the biggest surprise of my life When I met you I'll never regret it Qin Han Yue Give me your necklace Qin Han-yue.
