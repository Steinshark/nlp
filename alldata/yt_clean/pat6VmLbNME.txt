- [Rhett] Today, the peanut butter boys - [Rhett] take a trip to heaven. - [Link] Let's talk about that ((Intro Music)) - [Link] Good Mythical Morning. - [Rhett] Every once in a while, - [Rhett] it's important to take time - [Rhett] to reflect on just - [Rhett] how blessed we are. - [Link] Yes. And today is definitely - [Link] one of those days. - [Link] Honestly, I don't want to even - [Link] talk any longer. - [Link] I want to get into it. - [Link] Almost don't even want to acknowledge - [Link] this amazing Halloween set. - [Rhett] What? ((Screams)) - [Link] You scared me, dude. - [Rhett] I'm so scared of pumpkins. - [Rhett] Anything from the gourd family. ((Screams)) - [Rhett] There's one. - [Link] Stop it. - [Rhett] Sorry. - [Link] Okay. ((Laughing)) - [Link] It's time for - [Link] Gut Check: Reese's Edition. - [Link] Dude, you got me all - [Link] You got me all spiked up. - [Rhett] Sorry, man. - [Stevie] Peanut butter boys, - [Stevie] today you get to continue - [Stevie] those spirited debates - [Stevie] about the best proportion of - [Stevie] peanut butter to chocolate. - [Stevie] While you Gut Check - [Stevie] your very favorite Reese's. - [Stevie] The Mythical Crew has acquired - [Stevie] all of the available Reese's candy varieties, - [Stevie] meaning no Reese's snack products - [Stevie] and no seasonal products. - [Stevie] For a whopping total of - [Stevie] 30 Reese's varieties - [Stevie] that you will try today. - [Stevie] And after you try each one, - [Stevie] you'll give it a score of 1 to 100 - [Stevie] based on your gut reaction. - [Link] 1 to 100. Thank you for - [Link] yet another helpful scoring aid. - [Link] The ultimate peanut butter boy - [Link] scoring chart. - [Rhett] Yeah, and thank you for - [Rhett] giving me one of Link's old ones. - [Link] We typically sign those, - [Link] and give them away - [Link] at the Mythical Society. - [Rhett] This is a bit of an upgrade - [Rhett] from just a piece of cardboard - [Rhett] with Sharpie on it. - [Stevie] So today we felt that - [Stevie] the palate cleansers were extra important - [Stevie] because you don't know what's going to - [Stevie] cut through that peanut butter. - [Stevie] So you have some options. - [Stevie] You have some white bread - [Stevie] because of course. - [Stevie] You also have some milk - [Stevie] and you have some seltzer water. - [Stevie] So I guess you'll discover as we go - [Stevie] throughout this thing - [Stevie] what's going to help you the most, - [Stevie] because you're going to be - [Stevie] consuming a lot of peanut butter today. - [Stevie] And - [Link] Yes, Lord. - [Stevie] Thank you. - [Link] I will call you Lord, today. - [Stevie] You know I like it - [Stevie] when you call me, Lord. - [Stevie] We're going to kick it off - [Stevie] with our Regular Sized Cup category, - [Stevie] starting with - [Stevie] the original Milk Chocolate - [Stevie] peanut butter cups. - [Link] Oh, it's got a nice ridge on it. - [Rhett] I mean, that's almost a perfect candy. - [Rhett] 97. - [Link] You know what? - [Link] I think there's plenty versions - [Link] that are better than this. - [Link] I'm going to give it - [Link] an 80 - [Stevie] Now, I'm not going to say Reese's - [Stevie] every single time we go through this. - [Stevie] So I'm just going to go with - [Stevie] Creamy Milk Chocolate. - [Link] Creamy Milk Chocolate. - [Rhett] That's a thing? - [Link] I didn't know that was a thing - [Link] it puts a little bit more emphasis - [Link] on the peanut butter. - [Rhett] It is smooth. - [Rhett] It kind of caught me off guard, - [Rhett] to be honest with you. - [Link] 75. - [Rhett] I agree. I don't think - [Rhett] it's quite as good as the orig. - [Rhett] it still very good. - [Rhett] 90 - [Stevie] Crunchy Milk Chocolate. - [Link] What? - [Rhett] Do you know about this? - [Link] Well, the peanut butter is crunchy, - [Link] not the milk chocolate. - [Link] I'm not much of a - [Link] crunchy peanut butter, man. - [Rhett] The thing I don't like - [Rhett] about crunchy peanut butter - [Rhett] is that you taste the peanuts, - [Rhett] the whole peanut changes - [Rhett] the overall taste of the peanut butter. - [Rhett] So I like the experience of the crunch. - [Rhett] Don't like the taste as much. - [Rhett] 84. - [Link] I'm going to give it an 80. - [Link] Tied with the original. - [Stevie] Chocolate Lovers Milk Chocolate - [Link] What could that mean? - [Link] Chocolate lovers? - [Link] Maybe it's like - [Link] a higher end milk chocolate. - [Rhett] I think the chocolate's - [Rhett] trying too hard in this one. - [Link] I do too. Yes. - [Link] 61. - [Rhett] It's still very tasty. - [Rhett] 78. - [Stevie] White Creme. - [Rhett] That was my nickname in high school. - [Stevie] I was waiting for it. - [Rhett] Sometimes I just feel obligated. - [Rhett] Not a huge fan of white chocolate. - [Rhett] 48. - [Link] It's not bad, but it's not good. - [Link] I give it a 50. - [Stevie] Plant Based Oat Chocolate Confection. - [Rhett] What? - [Rhett] This feels like a joke. - [Link] And what happened to it? - [Rhett] It got plant based. - [Link] It's hard. - [Rhett] You sure this is real? - [Link] It's crisp and powdery inside. - [Rhett] It tastes like a really old Reese's - [Rhett] like this would be from the, - [Rhett] if we were tasting expired Reese's - [Rhett] from the 60's - [Link] Yeah. - [Link] Just do without. - [Rhett] That's a 12. - [Link] I'll give it a 1 - [Stevie] Organic Milk Chocolate. - [Rhett] Yeah I need to get my - [Rhett] I need to wash my mouth out. - [Link] I need to wash my mouth out. - [Rhett] Wash my mouth out with milk. - [Link] Organic, so this is just - [Link] for your conscience. - [Rhett] There is a difference in taste. - [Rhett] Completely different. - [Link] I know. I'm surprised. - [Rhett] I think I actively, slightly dislike it. - [Rhett] 49. - [Link] 24. - [Stevie] Organic Dark Chocolate. - [Rhett] Okay - [Link] Is this better? - [Rhett] It's harder. - [Link] Why is it so hard? - [Rhett] Because it's dark. - [Rhett] It doesn't have the - [Link] Other organic was hard. - [Rhett] Not that hard. - [Rhett] It doesn't have the nasty chocolate taste. - [Rhett] This just tastes like - [Rhett] dark chocolate with peanut butter. - [Link] I can almost not taste - [Rhett] Which I enjoy on my own, - [Rhett] but I don't like - [Rhett] in the Reese's combination as much. - [Link] I'm not getting - [Link] enough peanut butter here. - [Rhett] 54. - [Link] 30. - [Stevie] And that concludes - [Stevie] the regular sized category. - [Stevie] Up next are Big Cups - [Rhett] Big boys - [Stevie] Starting with - [Stevie] Big Cup Milk Chocolate - [Stevie] peanut butter cups. - [Link] I've always been afraid of these. - [Link] They come on so strong and tall. - [Link] Okay. - [Link] See, now at least - [Link] we're back to softness. - [Rhett] Everything's right in the world again. - [Rhett] And I really love the peanut butter - [Rhett] in these things. - [Rhett] I mean, this is almost perfect for me. - [Rhett] This is just the regular stuff - [Rhett] with a different ratio. - [Link] Like twice as much peanut butter - [Link] to chocolate, but chocolate is - [Link] chocolate is the only thing that can - [Link] outdo peanut butter flavor - [Rhett] 93 - [Rhett] Very good, candy. - [Link] I am not on the - [Link] peanut butter over the top train. - [Link] It's still great but - [Link] 65. - [Stevie] Big Cup with Reese's Puffs - [Stevie] Cereal Milk Chocolate. - [Link] This is something. - [Link] I want to look at it. - [Link] I don't see any in there. - [Rhett] You'll taste it. - [Rhett] Now, that's pretty good. - [Link] There's not that many - [Link] of the cereal - [Rhett] Because you get a crunch. - [Rhett] You get a crunch without - [Rhett] changing the taste of - [Rhett] the peanut butter too much - [Rhett] because the cereal already - [Rhett] tastes like the peanut butter. - [Rhett] It seems a little gimmicky, though. - [Link] I like it better than the Big Cup. - [Rhett] 92. - [Link] Yeah. I'm gonna give it - [Link] a 77. - [Stevie] Big Cup with Pretzels. - [Link] Oh, Lord. - [Link] Don't. Ain't no way. - [Link] The salty. - [Rhett] You don't taste much - [Rhett] of the original pretzel. - [Rhett] It's more just the crunch. - [Link] The salt kind of enhances - [Link] the the flavor of the peanut butter. - [Link] And I don't actually taste pretzels. - [Rhett] Yeah, because it's overwhelmed - [Rhett] by the chocolate - [Rhett] and the peanut butter. - [Link] At all. Wow. - [Rhett] 88. That's better - [Rhett] than I thought was going to be. - [Link] I got to take it back. - [Link] Yeah, this is, freaking, a surprise. - [Rhett] Is pretzel hater - [Rhett] going to be a pretzel lover? - [Link] I'm going to give it a - [Link] I'm gonna give it an 80. - [Rhett] Look out. - [Stevie] Big Cup with Potato Chips. - [Rhett] Really? - [Link] Let's see if this works. - [Link] A thinner crunch than the pretzel. - [Rhett] It was like a whole potato chip in there. - [Rhett] Mine felt like it was - [Rhett] a whole potato chip - [Rhett] that had been flattened. - [Link] Not as good as the pretzel - [Link] because not as much of a crunch. - [Link] It's more of a break. - [Rhett] I feel like the potato of it all - [Rhett] detracts a teeny bit - [Rhett] from the chocolate experience, - [Rhett] but I still really like it. - [Rhett] I'm going to still give it a 79. - [Link] I'm going to give it a 49 - [Link] just because the pretzel - [Link] was that much better. - [Stevie] Stuffed with Pieces Big Cup. - [Rhett] With Reese's Pieces? - [Link] Reese's Pieces. - [Rhett] They made them big. - [Rhett] They made the Big Cups big, - [Rhett] and then they were like, - [Rhett] we have to fill these cups. - [Rhett] And they've been filling them - [Rhett] with things for years apparently - [Link] This one gets a little too sweet. - [Link] I've just discovered I'm more of a - [Link] saltified peanut butter guy - [Link] than a sweetafied peanut butter guy. - [Link] 55 - [Rhett] I like Reese's Pieces, - [Rhett] but something about the combination - [Rhett] is making both of them worse - [Rhett] than they would be on their own. - [Rhett] Not a lot of synergy here. - [Rhett] Still tasty. 65. - [Stevie] And that concludes the Big Cup category. ((Laughing)) - [Stevie] Now it's time for the - [Stevie] Small Cup category. - [Link] This is, I think, going to be my jam. - [Rhett] I like small cups too. - [Link] more chocolate - [Link] to the peanut butter ratio. - [Rhett] All cups don't have to be big. - [Stevie] Starting with - [Stevie] Thins Milk Chocolate. - [Rhett] I'm more of an ass man anyway. - [Link] I don't like the milk chocolate. - [Link] I can tell it's like an imitation Reese's - [Link] 31. - [Rhett] I don't understand this one. - [Rhett] I still like it more - [Rhett] than not liking it though. - [Rhett] 51 - [Stevie] Thins Dark Chocolate. - [Link] Okay, we know the drill. - [Link] 44. - [Rhett] 49. - [Stevie] Thins White Creme - [Link] I'm hitting a bit of a wall. - [Rhett] Thins White Creme. - [Rhett] Yeah, that was me around 17, 18 - [Rhett] It's so thin. - [Link] That's not great. - [Link] 29 - [Rhett] 34. - [Link] Glad to have so many palate cleansers. - [Link] I kind of need all of them. - [Rhett] I'm not going bread - [Rhett] that seems too intense. - [Link] I have so much sugar - [Link] in my stomach - [Stevie] Milk Chocolate Miniatures. - [Rhett] Now, first of all, - [Rhett] you have a thing about these. - [Rhett] You really like these ratios. - [Link] These are classic. - [Link] Except not the milk chocolate. - [Rhett] I got a lot of your finger in that one. - [Rhett] It is nice though. - [Link] 54. - [Rhett] That's pretty good. - [Rhett] 74 - [Stevie] White Chocolate Miniatures. - [Link] I don't even want to taste it. - [Rhett] That's the best - [Rhett] white chocolate one so far. - [Rhett] I don't know why. - [Link] Because it's so much white chocolate. - [Rhett] Because I got more peanut butter - [Rhett] or more white chocolate? - [Link] White chocolate. - [Link] You're just bored with chocolate. - [Rhett] 56. - [Link] 19. - [Stevie] Dark Chocolate Miniatures. - [Link] Is that your finger? - [Link] Okay. - [Rhett] This one feels like - [Rhett] a different dark chocolate - [Rhett] than the Thins. - [Link] 46. - [Rhett] Because it's a little bit better. - [Rhett] 60 - [Stevie] Reese's Puffs Cereal - [Stevie] Milk Chocolate Miniatures. - [Rhett] Oh, they can get the cereal - [Rhett] into the miniatures? - [Link] They also have mini - [Link] Reese's cereal now. - [Link] Which I do recommend. - [Rhett] When you had this much sugar, - [Rhett] the appetite goes down. - [Rhett] And so you have to - [Rhett] keep moving your scale, - [Rhett] so that you don't overrate the things - [Rhett] at the beginning - [Rhett] because right now I'm like, - [Rhett] you know, I don't want this anymore. - [Link] I'm trying to take all that into account. - [Link] 68 - [Rhett] Because I remember liking - [Rhett] this combination a moment ago. - [Rhett] 74. - [Link] You got to eat some bread, man. - [Link] That'll help. - [Stevie] Zero Sugar Miniatures. - [Link] Oh, this could be awesome. ((Laughing)) - [Link] It's not nearly as bad - [Link] as I thought it was going to be. - [Rhett] but it feels like - [Rhett] there's something missing. - [Link] You know what? - [Rhett] It is way better - [Rhett] than I thought it was going to be. - [Rhett] I think I actively like it. - [Rhett] 54 - [Link] 36. - [Stevie] Reese's with Pretzels Miniatures. - [Link] Okay, the sleeper is back - [Link] in a small form. - [Rhett] Oh. - [Link] I'm such a fan of this. - [Link] I'm going to give it a 77. - [Rhett] 81 - [Stevie] Minis Milk Chocolate Unwrapped. - [Link] Come on, now. - [Rhett] Well, they've all been unwrapped. - [Rhett] What are you talking about? - [Link] No, they're usually wrapped. - [Link] These smaller ones. - [Rhett] Oh, you're saying that - [Rhett] these just come loose in a bag. - [Link] Yeah. You just you can just, like, - [Link] dump them all in the bag. - [Link] These are better, I believe, - [Link] than the minis - [Link] What are the smaller cups called? - [Link] These are the minis. - [Stevie] Miniatures. - [Rhett] I need the wrapping. - [Rhett] I need the wrapping. - [Rhett] You like these the best? - [Link] This is so good because - [Link] I don't debate - [Link] whether I should eat half of it - [Link] or all of it, - [Rhett] which is interesting - [Rhett] because I ate half of it. - [Link] Listen, that is almost tops right there. - [Link] I give that a 93. - [Link] You can eat two at once. - [Link] And even though I'm hurting, - [Link] I'm happy. - [Link] Counting my blessings. - [Rhett] I don't think there's enough - [Rhett] I don't think there's - [Rhett] enough peanut butter. - [Rhett] I mean, I like it. - [Rhett] I'll give it 82. - [Stevie] And that concludes the - [Stevie] Small Cups category. - [Stevie] Our final category of the day is Non-Cups, - [Stevie] starting with - [Stevie] Fast Break Milk Chocolate - [Stevie] Peanut Butter Candy Bars. - [Link] Okay, Fast Break. - [Link] Oh, look, we got a nice cross section. - [Link] Can you rotate it so I can still bite it - [Link] as if it were, - [Link] no not, there we go. ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] Would you say there's nougat in this? - [Link] There's nougat. - [Link] There's a nougat bed in the bottom. - [Rhett] I don't know if nougat - [Rhett] has a home here - [Rhett] I've turned nougat away many times. - [Rhett] Every time it comes to my door - [Rhett] during a storm. - [Rhett] I'm like, nougat, - [Rhett] I don't believe you have a home here. - [Link] Nougat is the hardest - [Link] soft thing you can eat. - [Rhett] What's hard about it? - [Link] It's soft, - [Link] but it's the hardest soft thing - [Link] you can eat. - [Rhett] I can think of harder soft things - [Rhett] like a Tootsie Roll is harder - [Rhett] but still soft - [Rhett] 29 - [Link] I'm going to give it a 99. ((Laughing)) - [Link] It is the softest candy bar - [Link] you can have. - [Rhett] That's weird. - [Link] It's such a favorite candy bar. - [Stevie] I'll remind the Mythical Beasts. - [Stevie] This is why at the end - [Stevie] we also reveal Rhett's favorite - [Stevie] and Link's favorite. - [Link] It's so good. It's the salt. - [Link] It's the hardest soft candy bar - [Link] you'll ever eat. - [Stevie] Okay, let's move on to - [Stevie] Take 5 Chocolate Peanut Butter - [Stevie] Candy Bars. - [Link] Tell me what's in this. - [Link] I know there's like pretzels in there - [Rhett] Pretzel taste comes through - [Rhett] real strong on this. - [Rhett] I would expect you to not like that, - [Rhett] because you definitely taste, - [Rhett] it's pretzel forward. - [Link] It's pretzels instead of nougat - [Rhett] Which is also - [Rhett] my nickname in high school. - [Link] Too much pretzel. - [Rhett] Too much pretzel, - [Rhett] which was also - [Rhett] No, I won't do it a third time. - [Rhett] I'll save it for another round. - [Link] It's a good taste. - [Link] It's just too much pretzel. - [Rhett] I don't like it. 49. - [Link] 60. - [Stevie] Sticks Milk Chocolate - [Stevie] Peanut Butter Candy. - [Link] Sticks? Oh, this is those things. - [Link] Wafers. - [Rhett] You can't slip a wafer - [Rhett] past these boys. - [Link] You get the nice, - [Link] tasteless crunch of a wafer. - [Rhett] Yeah. Wafers have never - [Rhett] done anything for anybody. - [Rhett] Wafers are the hardest. I mean - [Link] They've never done anything. - [Rhett] Wafers are the softest hard food - [Rhett] that you can eat. - [Link] Wafers are the most harmless food. - [Rhett] No, think about it. - [Rhett] They're the softest, hard food - [Link] They are. - [Link] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. - [Rhett] Get it? - [Link] Yeah. - [Link] 75. - [Rhett] But you like it? - [Link] Oh, yeah. - [Link] Because it's like a Nutter Butter - [Link] from Little Debbie. - [Rhett] I don't think. - [Rhett] I think wafers are - [Rhett] a "wafs" of "spafs" - [Rhett] 38. - [Stevie] Milk Chocolate Peanut Butter - [Stevie] XL Candy Bars. - [Link] Never had this. - [Link] Oh, this is - [Rhett] This is a piece of one - [Link] It's in like little cubes. - [Rhett] It's a candy bar that's basically just - [Link] For rich people. - [Rhett] Cups. ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] Yeah. I was definitely thinking - [Rhett] for rich people. - [Link] I love the ratio. - [Link] I love the softness. - [Rhett] You really like high chocolate ratios. - [Rhett] One of the things I'm observing. - [Link] I'm going to give it a - [Link] 70. - [Rhett] 70? - [Rhett] I don't like the chocolate ratio - [Rhett] on this one - [Rhett] but it's better than not good. - [Rhett] 62 - [Stevie] Nutrageous Milk Chocolate - [Stevie] Peanut Butter Candy Bars. - [Link] This one's begging for a 69 ((Laughing)) - [Link] Nutrageous. So there is a - [Link] a column of peanut butter in the middle - [Link] surrounded by nuts - [Link] and then surrounded - [Link] by chocolate in it. - [Link] It looks. - [Rhett] There's nougat too. - [Link] Like a floating dookie log. - [Rhett] There's nougat - [Rhett] or maybe there's caramel? - [Rhett] There's something sticking around - [Link] It's caramel. - [Link] 48. - [Rhett] I thought you were going to say - [Link] 69. - [Link] I wanted to. - [Rhett] 69. - [Stevie] Reese's Pieces. - [Link] What? That's it? - [Link] All of a sudden - [Link] we're eating Reese's Pieces? - [Stevie] That's where we are. - [Rhett] How did we get here? I wonder. - [Rhett] It's very interesting to taste these - [Rhett] in the context of tasting Reese's, - [Rhett] because I'll get Reese's Pieces - [Rhett] at the movie theater, - [Rhett] and they work - [Rhett] because I'm eating popcorn - [Rhett] and drinking Diet Coke - [Rhett] at the same time. - [Rhett] But they're not good in the context - [Rhett] of eating other Reese's stuff - [Link] On this scale. In this session, - [Link] I'm giving it a 28. - [Rhett] I don't feel like I could do that, - [Rhett] but I feel like as low - [Rhett] as I could go - [Rhett] is a 50. - [Rhett] And that's shocking to me. - [Stevie] Mini Reese's Pieces. - [Link] I thought we were done. - [Rhett] These are for ET's baby. ((Laughing)) - [Link] I'm gonna give it a 27. - [Rhett] There's more candy per peanut butter. - [Rhett] Which makes it not as good - [Rhett] 42 - [Stevie] That concludes the Non-Cup category - [Stevie] You have now tasted every - [Stevie] Reese's candy variety - [Stevie] available, and your scores will now - [Stevie] tabulated, so that you may more - [Stevie] closely judge your top 4 flavors - [Stevie] and crown the winner - [Stevie] Reese's royalty - [Rhett] Before we reveal our top four. - [Rhett] Do you know what we did? - [Rhett] We took Stevie to Halloween Horror Nights, - [Rhett] and you and her were so scared. - [Link] Stevie, you had never been in a horror maze. - [Stevie] Never, ever. - [Rhett] It showed. - [Link] I had, but I don't like them. - [Link] And he freaking loves them. - [Rhett] I tried to help all I could. - [Link] You can watch us be scared - [Link] again and again and again and again. - [Link] And also eat some amazingly - [Link] horrified themed Universal food. - [Link] So go to Mythicalsociety.com - [Link] right now but hey here's a little trailer. - [Rhett] Stevie, what do you think - [Rhett] about being scared? - [Stevie] I am so scared - [Stevie] of being scared ((Music)) - [Stevie] Oh my God. I did not see him - [Stevie] Yours are so much bigger. - [Stevie] than mine. - [Rhett] We're boys. - [Link] We're boys. - [Rhett] Link? - [Stevie] Link. - [Stevie] Link - [Rhett] Looks like fun - [Rhett] Mythicalsociety.com - [Link] It was kind of like so unfun - [Link] it became fun. - [Link] I'm sure you'll love watching - [Rhett] I had a great time. All right. - [Stevie] Okay, so before I reveal - [Stevie] your collective top four, - [Stevie] your individual favorites are - [Stevie] Rhett, Milk Chocolate. So - [Rhett] Original. - [Link] Which we kept harping on milk chocolate. - [Link] But that's just the original. - [Rhett] The Creamy Milk Chocolate - [Rhett] wasn't gonna get through me. - [Rhett] That was different. - [Stevie] And, Link, yours was Fast Break - [Stevie] Milk Chocolate - [Stevie] Peanut Butter Candy Bars. - [Link] The softest hard bar on the planet. - [Stevie] Is that a surprise to you? - [Link] To me? No. - [Stevie] Oh, no. You knew you liked this bar. - [Link] I knew that I love this bar. - [Stevie] Oh, okay. So your least favorite, - [Stevie] of course, was the - [Stevie] Plant Based Oat Chocolate Confection - [Stevie] But in no particular order. - [Stevie] Here are your top four favorites. - [Stevie] Big Cup with Reese's Puffs, - [Stevie] Reese's Puffs Cereal Milk Chocolate. - [Stevie] Minis Milk Chocolate Unwrapped - [Stevie] Milk Chocolate Original - [Stevie] and Big Cup with Pretzels. - [Rhett] So, a little difference of opinion here. - [Link] Let's start with Big Cups - [Link] and then I think we should talk - [Link] about these two together. - [Link] Talk about these two together. - [Rhett] Which Big Cup is better? - [Link] I love both of these Big Cups. - [Link] We were pretty much in agreement. - [Link] It's just more of a question of - [Link] is the fact that - [Link] I was so surprised by the pretzel. - [Rhett] Surprised by the pretzel. - [Rhett] Oh, it's double wrapped. - [Rhett] Oh, it's triple wrapped. - [Rhett] No, it's quadruple wrapped. - [Rhett] No it's five, six, seven, eight, - [Rhett] Nine, ten. - [Rhett] I got ten wrappers! - [Link] Well, hold on. - [Link] But this one literally has one wrapper. - [Link] All right. So - [Rhett] I'm so excited about that. - [Link] Here is your pretzel - [Link] and there is your Puff. - [Link] Open the door and eat some stuff. - [Link] For such a tall daddy, - [Link] it's nice to be filled up - [Link] with something else, - [Link] something airy. - [Link] It doesn't add any flavor, though. - [Rhett] I like Puffs less. - [Link] So much crunch. - [Rhett] Pretzels real solid. - [Rhett] The salt, man. - [Link] So - [Rhett] The salt men. - [Link] We're saying that the pretzels - [Link] are better than the Reese's Puffs. - [Rhett] Significantly better side by side. - [Rhett] Now you love the ratio of these. - [Rhett] Let me give them a chance. - [Rhett] Let me give them a chance. - [Rhett] No wrappers. - [Rhett] Ten wrappers. - [Link] And I know you have - [Link] a lot of fun with wrappers. - [Rhett] What is the difference - [Rhett] between Stagecoach and Coachella? ((Laughing)) - [Link] Not anymore. - [Rhett] There's wrappers - [Rhett] at Stagecoach. - [Link] I'm sure. - [Link] Why are we talking about this? - [Rhett] Because of my awesome joke. - [Link] I love, okay, yeah. - [Link] I love these better, man. - [Link] They're just, they're less trouble - [Link] and they're so tempting. - [Link] They're just like, - [Link] gobble, gobble, gobble. - [Rhett] The peanut butter. - [Rhett] I'm just telling you, man. - [Rhett] The peanut butter gets lost. - [Rhett] You just like chocolate. - [Rhett] As a peanut butter boy. - [Link] Don't yell at me. - [Rhett] I'm disappointed in you. - [Rhett] You can't taste the peanut butter. - [Rhett] I just had a whole one and - [Rhett] I could barely tell that - [Rhett] there was peanut butter there. - [Link] Do you like this better - [Link] than the Reese big puff? - [Rhett] Where's the pretzel one? - [Link] You don't need to taste the pretzel one - [Rhett] I need to know. - [Rhett] Oh, do I like, I like the big puff - [Rhett] better than those for sure. - [Rhett] The question is, do I like the big puff - [Rhett] better than the original? - [Rhett] I don't know, maybe - [Link] I'll go with that. - [Rhett] Did I just eat yours? - [Link] Yes. - [Link] I'm putting the original - [Link] down below all three of these. - [Rhett] Okay. - [Rhett] I don't like the Big Puff Reese's Puffs. - [Rhett] I tasted that again - [Rhett] and it's not good. - [Link] I'm willing to say - [Link] that I'm not being nostalgic. - [Link] All right. So if you give me - [Link] this pretzel wherever I want it. - [Link] I'll let you place the other two, - [Link] and I'll let you place them first. - [Rhett] Well, I'll tell you - [Rhett] before you place it. - [Link] Okay. - [Rhett] Then, in my opinion - [Link] Yeah? - [Rhett] The pretzel is the best one. - [Link] All right. Yeah. - [Rhett] I think the pretzel is - [Rhett] so unexpected, and the salt - [Link] So we're going to. - [Rhett] makes it even better than the original. - [Link] We're going to put original there, - [Link] and then we're going to put - [Link] I'm going to put this here, - [Rhett] But then - [Link] You're going to put this here - [Link] and we're just not going to argue about it - [Link] because it's third, who really cares? - [Rhett] And what we're saying, - [Rhett] to the surprise of - [Link] Everybody. - [Rhett] people everywhere. - [Link] The Reese's Pretzels Big Cup is - [Link] whatever we're calling the winner. - [Rhett] The best Reese's. - [Stevie] Reese's Royalty. - [Rhett] Reese's Royalty. - [Rhett] That's almost as scary as a pumpkin. - [Link] Thanks for subscribing - [Link] and clicking that bell. - [Link] Remember, tomorrow - [Link] our special Halloween episodes. - [Link] Come on back. - [Rhett] You know what time it is. - [Nick] My name's Nick, - [Nick] and this is my dad, Alexander. - [Nick] We're in Madison, Wisconsin, - [Alexander] and we're about to do - [Alexander] Gut Check: Reese's Edition - [Nick] And it's time. - [Nick] To spin the Wheel of Mythicality - [Rhett] Well, shoot, - [Rhett] we didn't even need to do it. - [Link] You're in for it. - [Rhett] Click the top link to - [Rhett] watch us discover the ten worst - [Rhett] rated businesses on Google - [Rhett] and Good Mythical More - [Link] And to find out where - [Link] the Wheel of Mythicality is going to land. - [Rhett] We went to Halloween Horror Nights - [Rhett] with Stevie.
