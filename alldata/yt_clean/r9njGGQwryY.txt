The guy's an idiot. <i> Nothing he says we can--</i> <i> --can go with or against it.</i> <i> He's null and void.</i> <i> - I was called so many things.</i> <i> I was called a celebrity.</i> I was called a pariah. I was called a traitor, I was called a freeloader. - So it seems like you pretty much misunderstood - 100% misunderstood. This was something I took that I was making sure that I <i>So I was in deep thought going,</i> <i>&quot;Okay, answer this right, Kato,&quot; <i> If you pause, people go, &quot;He's <i> He's doin' this.&quot;</i> The furthest thing It's for me to become For me to make sure I <i> - Which brings us <i> Kaelin and Simpson <i> - About what time was - About 9:40. <i> - Kaelin goes to his bedroom,</i> <i> and prosecutors say <i> A crucial hour passes</i> <i> before Kaelin hears [knocking on stand] <i> - And where did that - Through the back of the wall. <i> - That, prosecutors say, <i> hitting an exterior wall <i> At 10:55, a limo driver,</i> <i> waiting to take Simpson <i> spots a Black person.</i> <i> Six feet tall, 200 pounds.</i> - I saw a figure come into <i> - Allan Park says</i> <i> he'd been buzzing the <i> and received no response,</i> <i> proving, prosecutors say, - This time there was an answer, which was Mr. Simpson.

We know that from a witness out at the airport, I believe, saw him getting out when he left that the night of the murders and had his arm buried <i> - Next, with so much evidence, <i> - ...that's people 77.</i> <i> - Chris Darden blew it.</i> <i> </i> <i> </i> <i> - No weapons, no witnesses,</i> <i> but a wealth <i> The team prosecuting <i> believes they can prove he <i> Ron Goldman - This appeared to me to be <i> or a rage killing.</i> <i> </i> <i> - There was blood everywhere.</i> <i> At the Bundy crime scene,</i> <i>at Simpson's Rockingham Estate,</i> <i> and scattered along <i> Blood, prosecutors say, <i> - Does that mean that these <i> that Mr. Simpson has</i> <i> that are also found in the <i>are only found in approximately</i> <i> 1 out of 170 million - Yes, approximately. <i> - And that's not all.</i> <i> Blood consistent with <i> was found in Simpson's Bronco,</i> <i> on that glove discovered <i> and on these socks <i> - You described that <i> as matching Nicole Brown, <i> - That's correct.</i> <i> - Then there were <i> in the Bronco,</i> <i> and on Nicole's dress.</i> <i> FBI expert Wlliam Bodziak says</i> <i>the prints came from Bruno Magli <i> in Simpson's size 12.</i> <i> - Can you include him</i> as a candidate who could that created the impressions <i> - Yes, I could include <i> for possibly having <i> - As the trial wears on, <i>from socks and shoes to gloves.</i> <i> </i> <i> One found at the murder scene.</i> <i> The other behind <i> Proof, prosecutors believe, <i> is a cold-blooded killer.</i> <i>- I'm handing Mr. Simpson the...</i> <i> ...dust glove document.</i> <i> - That's people 77.</i> <i> - What were you thinking <i> Christopher Darden request</i> that Simpson try on - [chuckles] I was sitting in the courtroom.

Marcia Clark to blowing the case, <i> When O.J. was able to walk in <i> &quot;It's too small,&quot; 'cause he had already And he wasn't cross-examined. <i> So, for us, it was a win-win.</i> [thumping microphone] <i> - Alright, he appears to have <i> - But to juror David Aldana, <i> So O.J. Simpson was right in <i> when he put on that glove?</i> - He was about maybe - What do you remember <i>- You know, a lotta people make</i> a big deal about it. But, y'know, I wear gloves all the time. <i> I know that when my gloves <i> </i> - Yes, I do. <i> - After 92 exhausting <i> 58 witnesses,</i> <i> and 488 exhibits...</i> - We ask the court to receive and the people rest. <i> - Next...</i> - The LAPD's laboratory <i> - ...The defense unleashes</i> <i> a blistering attack.</i> - How' bout that, Mr. Fung? <i> </i> <i> </i> <i> - We think the evidence that he did not, <i> committed <i>- Johnnie Cochran, on the attack - The LAPD's laboratory <i>- Citing police incompetence...</i> <i> - Some had gloves,</i> some didn't have gloves, picking up the evidence. <i> - Even suggesting a conspiracy</i> <i> to frame O.J. Simpson.</i> - The fact that blood on vital pieces of evidence <i> is devastating evidence</i> of something far more sinister. <i> </i> <i> - Then came a turn - How 'bout that, Mr. Fung? <i> - Defense Lawyer Barry Scheck</i> <i> blasts LAPD criminologist - Did you touch that <i> - Confronting him about not <i> evidence and picking apart</i> <i> inconsistencies in his <i> - So, you did begin <i> before the coroners left?</i> <i> - Yes.</i> <i> - So what you said before <i> - It was to the best of my - What do you remember <i> torn apart by Sheck?</i> - Oh, man. - Does that refresh Is that a concern of yours? Sure of that? <i> - Barry Sheck is one <i> he just ripped him apart.</i> - You truly believe that - Yes, I--from this day 'till the day I die. I think it was planted. <i> - And who does the defense <i>Mark Fuhrman, the same detective</i> <i>prosecutors say found the glove</i> <i> outside Simpson's home.</i> <i> - Did you wipe a glove in the - No. <i> - You did not.</i> <i> - Did you ever for a moment</i> believe that the police - Frame him? I think that was in <i> - And you say on your oath <i> any Black person as a nigger</i> <i> or spoken about Black people <i> in the past 10 years, - That's what I'm saying, sir. <i> - So that anyone who comes <i> and quotes you as <i> in dealing with <i>would be a liar, would they not, - Yes, they would. <i> - All of them, correct?</i> <i>- I was focused on Mark Fuhrman, his every eye movement, I had no notes. I only wanted one thing <i> Denial.</i> - No. <i> - Never.</i> <i> - Once he said,</i> <i> &quot;Never in ten years</i> <i> have I ever used the N-word,&quot;</i> I knew we had him. <i> - When he was asked <i> about using the N-word,</i> everybody in the world knew <i> - What I didn't know was</i> we also had him on tape. <i> - Four months after <i> the defense gets a tip <i>Screenwriter Laura Hart McKinny.</i> <i> She interviewed <i> that she was writing.</i> <i> A very candid conversation, <i> </i> - He's just a real racist scum. <i> - Now we're gonna look at <i> and what a scumbag he is.</i> <i> - Fuhrman says the N-word <i> But judge Ito decides <i> The excerpts are brief,</i> <i> yet powerful and disturbing.</i> <i> After the excerpt</i> ended, the Fuhrman tapes, <i> you broke down and cried - Because I was worried Because I watched them with this look of horror and watched them turn. I was like, that's it. <i> - That's it.</i> <i> Fuhrman had lied on the stand</i> <i> and used a racial slur.</i> <i>The defense now feels confident</i> <i> they have a racist who <i> a charge Fuhrman denies today</i> <i> and refused to address <i> - Detective Fuhrman, <i> any evidence in this case?</i> - I assert my - He refused to answer it might tend to What more does anyone need? <i> - Fuhrman is disgraced - There's no doubt <i> - Coming up...</i> - If it doesn't fit, <i> - The unforgettable closing <i> </i> <i> </i> <i> - Late September 1995.</i> <i> For nine long months,</i> <i> the trial of the century</i> <i> has been a national obsession.</i> - Stop domestic violence! Stop the cause of silence! <i> - But a casualty of the <i> is the freedom <i> The jury has been - We were told it was And then when the third was four and then five. And it kept going, <i> - Back in court,</i> <i> O.J. Simpson cites the jurors <i> he's not going to testify.</i> <i> - Four days later, - You have heard <i> - No more witnesses.</i> <i> No more delays.</i> <i> Just closing arguments.</i> <i> First up, - And let me come back to Mark Just so it's clear. Did he lie when he testified saying that he did not use in the last 10 years? Yes. Is he a racist? Yes. <i> But the fact that Mark Fuhrman <i>and lied about it on the witness that we haven't proven the beyond a reasonable doubt. - How, in this country-- <i> - Then comes Defense Attorney - There's no doubt and a genocidal racist, But there's really that they played with And if that can happen, that's a reasonable doubt for Period, end of sentence, <i> - Finishing for the defense, <i> with probably the most - If it doesn't fit, <i> - After nine months <i> ...hundreds of exhibits...</i> <i> ...more than 260 days <i> jurors are finally sent to - Thanks for joining probably thought - Stop the cause of silence! <i>- And everybody had an opinion.</i> - I think it's gonna be - I would - I believe absolutely there's <i> - Why were you so confident</i> he was going to be found guilty? - I just couldn't possibly that with all of the of evidence against him <i> that they could possibly find <i> - By the time jury - You don't go back in time! <i> - ...the tension surrounding <i> And a clear <i> - This idea of race</i> was something that the defense They wanted that in the dialogue - Two thirds of Americans 77% of Whites think he's guilty. <i> 72% of Blacks <i> - Based upon the way along racial lines by the end of a videotaped confession and even you'd have people say, &quot;I don't believe that that tape <i> That's how bad it got.</i> <i> - Despite rampant speculation <i> there are only 12 opinions <i> - We walked into that room.</i> &quot;Well, let's see, what do you wanna do first?&quot; &quot;Well, let's just see We went around the room, y'know, guilty, not guilty. <i> - It's two votes guilty, <i> Now, you guys had been <i> You were tired.</i> You hadn't seen your families, <i> your friends, you wanted Were the majority of you to get those two to come - Actually, no, uh-uh. There wasn't arguing or yelling or anything like that. We just came And the other two came onboard. And they said, &quot;Not guilty.&quot; And it wasn't because they it was because the prosecution <i> - Aldana still believes</i> <i> the police framed O.J.</i> How is it that with against O.J. that he's set free? - Some of that stuff And when some of it was planted, - How did Mark Fuhrman in your decision when it came - Quite a bit 'cause everything that he... ...had anything to do with I knew he was dirty. After a while, - Do you truly believe that the the criminologists were as the defense - Yeah, I think so. <i> - Coming up...</i> <i> - All right, Mr. Simpson,</i> <i> would you please stand <i> - ...the dramatic [cheering] <i> - ...and a country divided.</i> <i> </i> <i> </i> <i> - After a marathon trial,</i> <i> millions of people <i>waiting for the verdict to come.</i> - How long do you think they're - I would be very surprised if they came back in less than - I think at least 10 days. <i> - You just never know.</i> People always say, &quot;What do you Nobody knows. - Another development now in the <i> the jurors are being brought <i> - But no one expected this.</i> <i> - After eight months of trial, <i> just four hours to reach - We couldn't believe it <i> that it was so fast.</i> - It took longer to than their verdict. <i> - Alright.</i> <i> - Simpson's fate decided</i> <i> but not revealed.</i> <i> - We are missing, <i> several of the attorneys</i> <i>and I've indicated to them that the verdicts from you <i> - Judge Ito decides <i> until the next morning.</i> <i> The world would have - Stunned and shocked, as far as reactions go. <i> </i> <i> - October 3, 1995.</i> <i> The sun rises.</i> <i> And everyone everywhere</i> <i> is waiting and watching.</i> - We were at we're standing in the suite, Looked out, <i> In Beverly Hills, no one No one. <i> - I heard that there was no because everybody was waiting for the verdict. <i> - People around the world</i> <i> stop what they're doing.</i> <i> The final moment <i> will be broadcast live.</i> <i> - Alright, Mr. Cochran, <i> would you please stand <i> - In the matter of the people <i> versus Orenthal James Simpson,</i> <i> case number BA097211.</i> <i> We, the jury <i> find the defendant <i> not guilty of the crime of - They read it, and then I just fell apart. <i> - Fred and Kim Goldman <i>- It was as if your insides got everything that we knew <i> that he had killed suddenly as if wait a minute, <i>- And then our side was in shock <i>- On the other side of the room.</i> <i> - ...y'know, jubilee...</i> ...going on on the other side.
