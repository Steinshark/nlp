Woman walks up to her in a parking lot My mom was the same way. Yeah. And you got, oh two Bentley's. You ever get them out? It's got to go out for it and Well, you ever want to do a trade or anything? Yeah. Although it must be a little rough on a dirt road. See, I don't do dirt roads. I don't do dirt roads. I know that. It got substantially altered from stock. the back was five inches wider And it's all done out of metal. Who would have done that? He built that one and he built the white Camaro. And how long you had that? So you did use it? Yeah. That's a lovely car. This is my... I can remember that trip that we took out in this. It was. Dead battery, eh? I put tenders on all of them. A lot of them don't work. and I came back, about a third and they were not cheap tenders. It's easier to just let them freeze. I know that feeling. Goodyear license plate wall. But they're all bottles of booze. All Jim Beam or something? There's a few other ones that are in there That's not Jim Beam's. And then a selection of... You've got that old fire truck up front, That's 1913. 31. No, this is a 30 and that's a 31. 31s are really nice A's. They're a nice car. The Chevy was better, faster, and a little bit... This one, yeah. It runs. Just the way it is. Yeah. So it would move out. I can't wait to actually walk it down. No, it's a glass car. 1937 Minotti body. You had a proper hot rod. Oh, it's here, is it? So what are you doing in here? All my electrical. This is my distribution. Don't do too much work in here, but... That's all my fucking lighting. So this... here is the whole floor's heated. Yeah. I sort of remember, yeah, when all of that going in. Because I saw it when it was I remember them putting the roof on. I saw it and you had two panels of the roof done Yeah. Wow, what a change. 20... Okay, so, yeah, four years. So this is remarkable, right? They can't do a bridge over the 404 years. Tell me about it. Uh-huh. Yeah. I guess we'll have to wait for the rest of it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I was looking at. Yeah, it's in the other building. a bunch of little things. It's a mess, eh? Now he's not sure he wants to sell it. to get it off the ground. Yeah, I like that. That's nice. That one I've had for years. That's a stunning car. Now, that was one of the great eight. Yeah. Autorama. Who built it? You know, it drives me crazy. kind of job in all the time. count on three major projects. but there's, none of them are like this. I won't say they're junk because they're not junk, like this used to please me. Yeah. And it's so much more expensive now, too. That's why I like buying them now, done. It's cheaper to do it, to buy them done. saved yourself a hundred grand and it's done. Yeah. You got to pay a few bucks on it. See, this one, what I want to do Yeah. just have the top of the hood. And then have exhaust coming out outside. Right. I mean, well, instead of an A-frame or Right. are you aware that if you got the cast bars, they shatter. Well, that's so I started looking for cracks forge of a SoCal pot. And because I thought, you know, And this one's already got it. this different car because mine's a 30. I like the shop. I prefer the Coupes to Roasters. It is hard to drive. I'd really like to change it to automatic. It's got this five speed in it. Yeah. I know it doesn't make it fun. And then you got standard steering to boot. So now you're going to go around the corner. that you slide right across? Trying to push the passenger out of Yeah. Yeah. No, it is. But you don't have any problem That's the thing. you can see how the exhaust is on the back one. You can see how it's blacking over there. Just like me. up and down the driveway. Yeah, that's nice. I've got a real thing for hot I've always had it since I was a kid. I'm reverting back to my inner, I know that feeling. Yeah. of us has ever grown up, have we? Nothing wrong with that. Not too many, eh? Three. Three. Yeah. Right. Now I have been. It's still, sometimes it's Yeah. Like, if I go for a ride Well, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's got a full-size color TV in it. No. No, we drove it. Yeah, when I got home. Yeah, because those tires What's the weight? 15,000 pounds. Seven and a half tons. Yeah. to worry about people shooting at you. You need Martin and AK-47 for that one. And then, well, your idea of, You told me you wanted to get a... go fast kind of a boat. And my wife says, nope, We got eight grandkids. So, this is your idea of a pontoon boat. Yep. When you told me you had a pontoon boat, I ebony root on the back, popping around No. So... This is go fast. This is go by, right by the bass boat. Yeah, that's what it is. When you said that you were getting I just had no idea. It's got wrapped clear. Got wrapped clear, and then I Polished them up. I'm gonna have them wrapped and clear. Well, that saves a lot of aggravation. Until you get a little nick in the That's fine. But then you can redo it. I could take about 18 on it. Yeah. any underneath or is it just a platform? There's under the seats. And then in the center between, um, the there's a spot there. Uh-huh. uh, bumpers that I put in there. well because they're great. fit underneath the seats. So it's always there. And now you've got your green corner. Well, the green, that's the other, so that's where I parked it last Uh-huh. Yeah. I mean, it's customized for sure. I accepted the motor. No. Well, you know, those are nice little motors. It worked good enough. Yeah. Uh-huh. through the back behind my seat. To be able to do what I did here. Yeah, I mean, they were silly. the roof in, not that roof. And that was about it. No, you couldn't. That's right. than anything else they made in the 90s. I did, too. I had a, I had a GTS, and I loved that. I always regretted selling it. But mine, you know, mine was a Yeah, I had a 96. Dangerous cars. Great. And dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. Exactly. Between this and the Cobra, they're the Yeah. Well, I saw recently one of the, I've said modern hyper cars like Mustangs and all that, The fuck? with a basically tuned but not overly done Yeah, that's nice. Yeah. Yeah, more or less, it just took Yeah. can actually hear in a Viper. Because the radio in my Viper was useless. And actually any long drive, I know. rattled by the time you got back. I drove it constantly. down to Kitchener and back and I just, I'd I went back. I went everywhere. Oh, yeah. What year was it? Oh, so you had to see. Yeah. The whole nine years. I ended up getting some special aerospace, a bit. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. side pipes, they burnt down the side sills there. Oh. No. Yeah. I mean, I'm not that familiar Never had one. And you know, I can still see me getting one much. Believe you me. For doing donuts in? Yeah. I just brought, I just had the, uh, GTR out. on top of the GTR. And then there's the old girl. No. You haven't even tried? They're fun, you sure? those wheels are so bad. that rubber wants to come off. Yeah. Yeah.
