Hi. I have a great and unique idea, which is turning your wooden so your fragile buttocks can rest in peace. All we need is a heating from this broken hairdryer as these wires. [scrape, scrape, scrape] So here we are. I hot glued their end connected to a cable where Okay there we are. (Plugs in) *seems fine so far* AUUAGH, OW S***! OW, F***! [spark] WHERE THE F*** IS IT?! [AAA!] S**T! * [SCREAMS] [cries like a b***h] [more screams] S***! (Unplugs) *Heavy breathing* F***! The whole seat is melte- O-OH S***! (more screams) In hindsight, mounting a heating dumb idea because the glue can And also, evidently, sitting on ...TERRIBLE idea! As my butt can confirm. Where are you? But we shall not be discouraged! There are other heating elements we could use. Like ...unplug easily. The good thing about these is that the element, so you won't get Also, in North America, they so if I run it on 120 volt, So... connecting it to Power... You won't get a shock although Now I don't know what metal it's made of. I'm guessing iron, but it's hardly conductive. So it's safe to touch. [Sizzle] A-AH OWW! F***! Of course getting shocked is not the only concern. Obviously, this thing is a heating even if I run it on 120 volt AC. And it's so I went and bought... some other heating elements. This one is pretty small. Maybe you can use it to heat a baby, or as intended, electric charcoal starter. DON'T USE IT ON BABIES, YOU IDIOTS! But this one is pretty nice, and fits my seat which is very similar to my oven element. I will be running it on 120 volt AC, which It can still burn, so I'm planning to reduce the power to it using a light dimmer. It says this dimmer is compatible new dimmable lights, which makes me wonder, what is the difference between this new dimmer and old ones? We have one of these old dimmers- [POP] TWGH, S***! We have this old dimmer, which I'll try to probe using my *4 channel awesome new KEYSIGHT scope!* Which I'll also give away 5 of One to a school and the rest If YOU like to win *these* as well as tons of register from the link in the video And so, if I short these two contacts, the light turns on. Now if I try to probe this... Connecting the probe ground without shocking myse- Oh, actually, they share the same ground. Okay. Now, the yellow line is the input voltage [Click] you see that when I slide the dimmer, It's here at minimum and here at maximum. And so, this reduces the effective AC But, things like LED lights are not ...although my LED light seems dimmable ...flickers a little bit at low voltage. The old dimmer I tested is made of a Solid-State is a type of SCR or thyristor. And in this case, Eh, too many words? Basically, it's an open circuit between *until* you send a current into the Gate terminal. And then, it switches closed and stays *even* after you remove the Gate signal, running current through it. It is bi-directional, meaning that the current can run through it So, this is the AC input and we have a and let's say, these are the trigger The output voltage is zero until the closes and the output follows the input... ...until the voltage reaches zero, which means that the current through the resistor is zero. And it turns off and again turns on by the next edge of the trigger and follows the input again and... ...cycle continues like we saw in the scope. Now by moving the dimmer knob we are simply that changes the on time of the triac So for example, if this pulse happens earlier, more of the voltage cycle goes out. Driving the inductive and capacitive loads is a whole other mess because their and turns zero when the voltage is at peak. Okay. Let's see what the new dimmer does differently. Does the exact same s***! So what?! It's compatible with the LED lights because the new LED lights are designed to be dimmable?! And this takes the credit?! What the he- [BANG] F***!! Don't kick live circuits because Anyway, let's see what's the difference between dimmable and not dimmable LED lights. I'm gonna film different lights using my camera Here's the incandescent. As expected, Here's the dimmable LED. It behaves And here's the undimmable light...and its So the dimmable LED light is designed to That's why we can dim it But the undimmable LED because it's designed to have mostly independent to the AC voltage. So... ...for the most part, you see it but at very low AC voltages, it craps out. Both have their own Benefits. One provides a fixed output brightness We are getting distracted. Let me hook up the voltage and temperature of the heater. Here we have voltage and temperature it's only around 4 volts But, we can ramp it up so it heats faster... ...and then... ramp it back down again. There you go. Very nice. Now we have an industrial Ooh.. The dimmer box says it but we might be running 750 watts There. I hot glued two pieces of stick We don't need more than half anyway. There. Now all you need is to shove this [Hehe] On the other hand, if somebody accidentally it could overheat the heater or the We could design a very good system where a microcontroller monitors the heating element temperature and PWMs to exactly what you adjust using a Who do you think I am? All I need is one of these food temperature See, what I've done is that I cut the housing piece of wire here to the And normally, this needle could move But now, as the temperature rises, the So the temperature can't rise any Is that- is that how it works? Because, I mean the needle is stuck It's just not showing it. I think we need to do better. Here, I did one more thing. I added the shaft of this thing, that's So now when the temperature rises, this piece of wire here and Here's the plan: I have a normally closed relay that coil is driven by my thermal switch and is I also keep the dimmer so I can adjust the rate of temperature rise. Now what happens is that when I is on and heats up, as well as my When the temperature reaches the threshold that I set with my thermal switch, the switch closes and energizes the coil of the relay and the relay switches over and turns off the heater element. Now the heater cools down, and when it cools down below the threshold, this switch opens and de-energizes the coil and the relay switches back over and the heater turns on, heating back up again. So the temperature is controlled Change of plan. I'm gonna use a 12-volt wall with the relay I have, that resistor ...and we plug it in. (Plugs in) There we go. Now the heater is on and you [Piano music] There we go. The switch is closed there is a delay for the temperature And so the temperature overshoots at which point the thermometer [More Piano Music] There, the heater is back on and Great! Now I can shove There. Now we just plug it in. [groan...-] (explosion) Oh..! They sell seat warmers for cheap. Pff! Was this a good video? Did you learn something? THEN SUBSCRIBE for God's sake!
