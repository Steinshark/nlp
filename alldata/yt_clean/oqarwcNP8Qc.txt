Well. I can do that. - All right. I'll be right back. (Margaret sighs) - What about Wyoming? - Well, there's not there's too much snow in the west. - So. No to Colorado. No to Wyoming. - Oregon, Washington. There's plenty of rain, not much snow. Cool summers and mild winters. - Kinda sounds like a song. - To you it sounds like a song. - James. - You don't think that I up those stairs just to get clean? (Margaret laughs) I'm wooing you. - Mm. Whew. Those buckets of water - They were, honey. - We gonna cross here? - To the west. - West? Where? - I don't know yet. (hooves galloping) - Cowboys are headed back to their camp. Need a few boys to help hold the herd. - Well, pick some. Most of them, they don't speak English and ones that do say they can't ride. - Well, they gotta learn sometime. - Don't disagree. Just not sure keeping is the time. Sure could use y'all. - I can saddle Lightning. - You ain't going by yourself. - You're coming. - No, I'm hunting. We need meat. - I'll catch Poko, too. Take care of your son. - You gonna ride herd? - Tired of getting my teeth My choice is to sit on I'm gonna sit in saddle. - How am I supposed to with a five-year-old? - Teach him to be quiet. Or find a dumb deer. - I can be quiet. - Well, I guess we're about (soft music) Shit. (crickets chirping) (Margaret sighs) - [Margaret] You don't - It's the world I don't trust. (Margaret chuckles) I do worry about your gun It's been a while since you - Mm. Watching over us? - Yes ma'am. - Just to be sure. - Mm-hmm. - Hmm. - How'd our baby girl do? - Baby girl's turned into a woman. - I know it. - She rides good. No fear. But not reckless. She rides like you. She has her eyes on this cowboy, and he's eyeing her right back. I don't know. - Well. I'll shoot him first - I'm serious. There's no gentlemen where we are. None where we're going. I'm worried it's not fair. - Did you marry a gentleman? - I did not. (laughing) - Worked out all right for you. - Oh yeah. It worked out great. (James laughs) Just like I dreamed it. - What would you change? (soft music) - Not a thing. Oh. I wouldn't mind a house. A big one. If you don't mind. - I'm gonna build you a house - Thank you. Mm. - Breakfast is ready. - [John] I'm gettin' dressed! - [James] Well, get dressed faster. - [John] I ain't got much practice of doing this by myself! - What the hell are those? - They grow on cactus. - [James] Well how do you - 'Cause I ate one yesterday. Try it. Gonna make a jelly out of it. - Hmm. - I got dressed all by myself, Mama. - I can see that. - Here you go, son. - Our daughter gonna join - She's with the herd. - She's been with the - It's making a good cowboy out of her. - I didn't know that was a goal. (saddle squeaks) - Where are you going? - I don't recall the part of our vows that said I need to ask your permission to go somewhere. (clicks tongue) (soft tense music) - What? What? - You's what. It's a free country. I can look at whatever I want. Judging by the way you dress, you don't mind it. (snickering) - I mind it. - What are you gonna do about it? (tense music) - I like this one. - Let me see. You got expensive taste, boy. - [Margaret] James! - You gonna shoot me, little girl? - You're goddam right I am. - It's harder to do than you think. - No it ain't. - [James] It comes real natural to me. - Look! We's just funnin'! And she pulls iron! - I guess she wasn't having too much fun. - All right. All right. Just, I'll put it down, okay? I put it down. - James. - I don't want to waste - You won't find us if you do. We's heading to Fort Worth. - Well I'd be headed that way. (tense music continues) (hooves galloping) - What is wrong with you? - Give it to me. You don't point this at anyone unless you plan on using it. - I was gonna use it. (soft tense music) - Go to camp. You wait there. (laughing) - [Margaret] Oh my god. - I never seen that before! Never seen it before! (laughing) - Hey. (both laughing) I gotta go study the river. (both laughing) - Fuck the river! - Can I trust you to stay here? - Yup. This long. As long as this is. (laughing) - Oh no. (soft music) (laughing) (Margaret retches) (soft tense music) (Margaret crying) Wherever we're going, 'Cause it's costing us a daughter. If you ask me, it's a shitty trade. - We ain't trading nothing. - She killed a man! And she was about to kill another. I look in her eyes, and the person staring back I will never forgive you for this! - You don't forgive me? I don't forgive me. (hooves galloping) You drive my horse across the river. I'll drive the wagon. - I'm perfectly capable. - I ain't questioning There's three times as many in the water with that. Now, you cannot forgive me all you want. Add this to your list of reasons, but I ain't losing you to a river. - You're forgiven. (soft music) (soft music swells) - What you just call me? - What is this fuck? - He don't know what that word means. Neither does he. And he's about to ask her. Then Lord help you. So maybe just don't use it, hmm? - It's a hard one to shake, Shea. - Well, start shaking. (Josef speaking German) - Go! - What does fuck mean, Mama? - It means a spanking, and a good one, if you say it again. - Is he getting a spanking? - Some form of one's - Mm-hmm. Come on. (people chatting) - He says get in line, and they don't. - They're guests. Guests don't wait in line. - Isn't that good? Half a steak for him? Okay, a whole steak. - You use that word in I'm gonna stab you with this fucking fork. - Yes, ma'am. Say thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Just so you know, that - Lesson learned. - Yeah, we'll see about that. - Let's talk about your daughter. - Uh-oh. She's mine again. What'd she do? - Ran off with that Comanche boy. Killed a buffalo. Mm-hmm. Came back, her face covered in blood, 'cause I guess they ate (James laughing) Go ahead and laugh. She's feral. You always talked about to be men, and you started with her. When we get back to any I'm gonna have to undo all of that. - Do you really want to? - Oh please, James. Let me deal with one dreamer at a time. - You're a dreamer, too. You wouldn't be with me if you weren't. - I'm a believer, honey. There's a difference. - Fair enough. (soft music) What is this? - It's for you. - Why is it for me? Are you aware of what he's asking? - I'm aware. Take the horse, Daddy. - Young lady, I will not allow this. - You're not allowing it. I'm 18 years old. I'm allowing it. - You think being 18 makes you a woman? - Law thinks it does. (soft music continues) - Don't just stand there, stop him! Shoot him! Do something! (Margaret sighing) - [James] I could make her go with us. - How are you gonna do that? If you tie her to the back of the wagon, she'll just chew through that damn rope. She said she'd ride with us to Oregon then come back to him in spring. Let's just hope she - With the pattern she's established, she'll fall in love again by Nebraska. (both laughing) - That's not funny. - You're the one laughing. You think our daughter's the only one out here falling in love? I bet there's immigrant kids fooling around behind every Ours just doesn't hide it. And if she loves something, she'll hold its hand in - She gets that from you. - She gets racing up that hill from me. But the way she loves, she gets that from you. That's why it scares you so bad. - I'm not scared. - My fear is selfish. I just wanna be with her. Know her children when she has 'em. And I can't alter the course of her life just 'cause I don't want to miss her. - She'll change her mind. (soft music) - It's filthy, honey. - She's young. She's young, and she's so strong. - And she's the light of my life. And she's my soul. She's gonna die. (slap lands) - How fucking dare you? I will not lose a child. Will not lose a child. - She's gonna die. And it's gonna cut us in two. And if we don't accept it now, she'll die in some fort with some doctor doping her up so badly And we will have robbed her. She needs to see every and we will lie to her. And we will tell her she's fine. And we will let her look at this world with those big dreamer eyes til they can't see anymore. - Then what are we gonna do? Just gonna be another cross on a trail that we don't visit. 10 years from now, it's just gone. - Our wagon drive's over. Where we bury her is where we stay. That is our home. - Not here. Not in this place. - No. Not in this place. I will find a place. By God, I will find a place. (emotional music swells) (Margaret crying) - I need a minute. - Walk with me? - John, go check on your sister. (Margaret sighs) - We can't wait it out here. - Why not? - Doesn't matter why, we just can't. Ain't no doctor can help her. Nobody can. And we ain't gonna lay her to rest here. We keep heading north. Where she dies, that's where we stay. She'll be with us. And you could visit her anytime you want. - Oh, I'll be there everyday. Until you put me in the (soft music) - Anything to eat? - I can make you something real quick. (soft music continues) - Sure glad I didn't get shot in the leg. - Gonna have to hold out - Hmm. Ain't going nowhere. - Fever's broke. Color's back, too. That's good. How's the pain? - It's there. But not like it was. - You want some bacon? - Sure. (soft music) Y'all made good time. Went from prairie to pine trees in a day. - We left the fort three days ago. - Oh. Slept my way here, I guess. - Yeah honey, you sure did. (flames crackling) Better? - You lied. - I'm sorry. (Elsa crying) - I'm dying. - [James] I know, honey. (slow emotional music) (slow emotional music continues) - Ma'am? (Margaret sighs) - So what is my husband - He promised your where she dies, and that's It's a week's drive on a wagon. She ain't got a week. Horse can make it in two days. - Still haven't heard a question. - Well. I really don't know what I guess the question is are you willing to say goodbye to her here? (Margaret sighs) - Men are such fucking cowards. (James crying) - It ain't cowardice, ma'am. It's shame that the - Well when do they leave? - Should leave in the morning. (Margaret gasping) (James inhales) - I'm sorry. (soft emotional music) (soft emotional music continues) (soft emotional music continues) (soft emotional music continues) - I love you. - I love you both. With all my heart. - See you in the valley, mama. - I'll see you there. (soft emotional music continues)
