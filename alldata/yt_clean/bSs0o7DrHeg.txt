There are now groups taking tourists on However, as I think you know by now, we are always on the most authentic story to experience So after months of logistics, we were able to get a who still takes this At 58 years old, however, there is and no one set to making him potentially With so many questions about this tradition and a 10-day trip to go camping I decided to bring Tommy, my least experienced friend camping, who's only camped for one on what will turn out to be one of Is this a good shoe?

Namaste The Rai people we are currently with are who have unwritten passed down from the elders We really had no idea and what we had gotten ourselves into. We are hiking deep to witness our So it's very special to and be a part of such a meaningful unlike anything I've done before. Oh my God, look at my shoes. There are leeches attacking us. Multiple of them right there. How many do you have? So many, I've been This is snugly, not Somehow this is the trail. This is supposed to be an easy one hour hike. I can't imagine what the So somebody carried chickens up here? Yep. I feel like I'm gonna faint.

How on earth do you swallow this? -Swallow, swallow. How long has the honey hunter It's something we've done for generations Almost like 260 years 260 year? Yeah almost yeah. How does a honey hunter get chosen? The shaman who does the prayers Evaluates the criteria of the person And then chooses the right one for the job He was the right choice after analyzing Whether he'd go mad, fall sick or die soon when climbing. If a random person goes you know it's gonna get pretty hard hard for them yeah This harvest will turn out good but then he has already predicted that within eight months, somebody in the village is gonna die Someone in the village in the So the recently chosen honey hunter is good, right? Of course How does he feel that? The harvest is gonna be good.

Tomorrow is the day of the actual harvest. We have really been putting our Seek Discomfort and we're just super excited that I feel like is what Seek Discomfort It's to be a catalyst for action. From our card game that's designed to be used whatever it is that you're So we are I'm pumped to be on the roughest conditions Wow, he was just Looking at it up close, it is Huge. I don't know how they do it! They make this look so easy One slip with even just a sprained ankle or worse, a broken bone here could As we are in the rainy monsoon season, no rescue helicopter could possibly come which means that we have to fully to make it through these We gotta go all the way down there. Oh my god! More people die from cows and sharks per year I'm not trying to mess with these guys. Oh great So tomorrow harvest is in that cliff! Holy f***! All the way up there. That's the one tomorrow? How is it even possible to get to? Hiking through leeches and jungle. How do you even find that? That's way worse than I thought, honestly.

After carrying all their equipment the hunters were immediately ready to start their first climb for There's a hike to get to the base of They're climbing to the top of and then the guy's gonna We can't even hike past this point. It's so treacherous. This was only going to be and the main harvest was planned which is the climb we And we were now seeing for the first time We are about to witness a man do the most And I'm comfortable saying that. It's not at all an exaggeration. If he falls that's death, And he's not doing this with He's doing this with a bamboo ladder This is the craziest thing I've ever seen. Dumping rain, dangling with the biggest beast in the Wow! Oh, wow. This is f***ing nuts, That was amazing.

Because I am not Are you kidding me? This is so much blood. Today's the day. Today's the day. As I woke up, barely slept for a week, the dangers of our day and my anxiety What part scares you the most? The part that scares me the most is Corey Yeah I feel like very anxious right now.

Snake skin Yeah It's poisonous Most poisonous from here Hey guys, what are we doing here? What dangerous thing isn't here? *Taking out bee stingers* With the most dangerous in a six-hour strenuous the jungle suddenly became quiet.

Cory's down safe. Holy s***! You're f***ing back. As Cory came down, they as they weren't finding as leading me to not have the time to In how many places did you get bitten today?
