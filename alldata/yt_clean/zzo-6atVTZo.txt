[narrator] You've never seen their faces. Garbo, Tricycle, Treasure... ...Brutus and Bronx. British spies during the second world war. Their mission: deceive Adolf Hitler to ensure the success of the DDAY landings in Normandy. [Max Hastings] the false information this was brilliantly handled. [narrator] that transformed these five agents [Nigel West] His case officer thought [Garbo] unless I have strong reasons to [narrator] of three men and two women Who changed the course of History. [narrator] Hitler's Germany [troops marching] [cars rumbling] Prague, Paris, [troops marching] Copenhagen. Europe's big cities fall one by one By November 1943, reign supreme over fifteen countries. [troops marching] Britain, the United States, and Canada join forces to liberate occupied Europe. They launch the operation Overlord. Its goal: to land thousands of soldiers on the beaches of Normandy in June 1944, and push the Nazi army It's risky. The enemy has been expecting somewhere along the Atlantic coast. And victory isn't assured [bomb exploding] [Max Hastings] were among that the world has ever seen, and they had these brilliant tanks. Of course, the allies had many more tanks, but the German tigers and panther tanks The German army, was... much better [sub-machine gun fire] [narrator] So, how does one deal with How do the Allies ensure [Winston Churchill] that it should be attended [narrator] When he pronounces these words British Prime Minister Winston Churchill Hitler must be tricked. [dramatic music] [Max Hastings] but also that if the Germans in the west in the first 24 or 48 hours they could well have thrown the allies But, if they could then the operation could succeed. [dramatic music] [Nigel West] That was the only way in which the invasion [police car's sound] [dramatic music] [narrator] is one of many In its basement, a bunker, built discreetly in 1938: the war cabinet. Here, in 1943, in military history is conceived: Operation Bodyguard. At the head of the mission, an ultra-secret organization and secret service personnel. They craft a crazy plan: to make Hitler believe will take place In Calais, in Norway, in the south-west of France, Everywhere except Normandy. To give substance to the plan, the allies create a phantom army: the &quot;First US Army Group&quot;, or FUSAG, stationed in the South-East of England. At its head, a true general, George S. Patton, well known by the Germans for his campaigns [dramatic music stops] [Nigel West] Germans expected him So publicly it was announced that he was going to command And the components were deployed in exactly In the southeast of England. In anticipation of embarking [narrator] The English film studios they create dozens truer-than-life decoys [Nigel West] was based on what Germans So, in anticipation you would expect a concentration of troops How do you accomplish that? There were reports in the newspapers of fights amongst American troops arguing over women in pubs and hotels It actually never happened, but these were reports [motorbike riding] [dramatic music] [narrator] the misinformation campaign expands. That duty falls to another the Twenty committee, or &quot;Double Cross&quot;. Led by Sir John Cecil Masterman, it brings together representatives British Secret Services and Allied armies. Its mission: to mislead These spies, actually worked for the allies. Among them, three men and two women play crucial role in Operation Bodyguard. Their code names: Tricycle, Bronx, Brutus, Garbo and Treasure. [Max Hastings] the most important and the agents involved Everybody knew that if D-Day failed, then all sorts of things were possible, whereas if D-Day succeeded, then the war in the West was sooner or later decided. [hopefull music] [airplane flying] [narrator] The National Archives of Kew, preserve all the details [dramatic music] Some top-secret documents, reveal the crucial role these spies played in pulling off the largest [Tricycle] that I am an awful person but believe it or not, I could not find half an hour I am dropping you these few lines that you should not worry so much She regained her health completely and nobody would believe a few month ago. [clink on the bottom] [crack and clink] [narrator] a double agent discreetly sends a message Between the lines, made of diluted aspirin. [Keith Melton] Good spies, don't want to have any proprietary Their safety is that So if they could access something they could buy from a pharmacy, then they could create an ink to use to communicate to their headquarters. [narrator] Revealing it takes more effort. The German intelligence services developed First, they coated the letter and let it dry for at least an hour. [pouring liquid] Then, they coated the letter After the second solution dried [H. Keith Melton] And the reason for this was that, often in the postal system, that they would use They would make a cocktail take a small brush, to see if any hidden writing developed. But with the two-part system, it would never ever [narrator] written eight months before D-Day, hides an invisible message, It is one of thousands pertaining to Operation Bodyguard. On the left, the cover letter. To the right, the secret writing. [Tricycle] I have too much material and as nothing is extremely urgent, I will bring it with me [narrator] The secret text For the British secret service, His real name: Dusko Popov. A 30-year-old Serbian [Nigel West] Dusko Popov, I thought that he was James Bond. He was suave, good looking. He had this ability to seduce women. He was a great womanizer. He was a very amusing raconteur. He had a funny story for every occasion. He was a gambler and he was a party goer and a wonderful playboy, but really very good company You couldn't fail but adore Dusko. [Mark Kelton] One would think running around with women, partying, all of those things would increase If you're looking for an agent, you're looking generally somebody who floats below the surface, doesn't draw attention to themselves In Popov's case, But interestingly, Because, I think the Germans, number one, But number two, had they been curious, they would've thought, okay, no reasonable intelligence service would ever accept a man like this [steps on crushed stone] [narrator] Marco Popov Today he is the custodian of his father's archives [Marco Popov] went to take his doctorate And there he met called Johnny Jebsen. They both shared Both had rich parents, enjoyed life, enjoyed whatever they could in those days. And both were so pro freedom that they ostensibly showed [narrator] that his friend Johnny the German secret service, [Marco Popov] and they already without words knew So, without saying it openly, it was clear from the start to Dusko that Johnny could not have been working without some subterfuge. [narrator] Dusko Popov is convinced to become a double agent and share In following is friend's idea, Dusko agrees to join the Abwehr. And, in 1940, Popov starts working for MI5 The Germans suspect nothing. They have full confidence Undercover as a ministerial attache Popov travels regularly to Portugal where he meets his German case master. [indistinct chatter] [Marco Popov] at the "Baccara" or roulette table and they would point the day, the time, and the place where an Abwehr car would pick him up. He'd jump in the back seat as they would come [narrator] At each meeting, Von Karsthoff Documents that the spy thanks to a surprising technology: [H. Keith Melton] is a photographic reduction to a size that it is so small that it is unreadable without some You can see that there's a dot there, This was one of the great developments Because it was so small, and that way it wouldn't be detected The only way he could read it [narrator] the spy reads the questions Of course, he transmits these documents Which provides the answers. Tricycle's playboy, socialite lifestyle provides the committee to justify the origin of its information. For months, the double agent between London and Portugal. The slightest misstep could expose him [Robert Wallace] The double agent is dealing with two professionals. Both professionals of whether or not that double agent And so, there would be, during the course the double agent where the other side is testing him. [Mark Kelton] The agent must be vigilant And he frankly must develop stories So if he goes to meet the service he has to have story So by going to Portugal. &quot;I go to Lisbon. I'm in Lisbon for a business reason,&quot; but he has to have a story Any mistake he makes [narrator] Very quickly, Popov becomes But the double agent has no idea [Nigel West] None of the agents knew that they were part Each believed that they were operating They didn't even know the real names who were supposedly frankly [narrator] The Double Cross Committee After devising the misinformation the Committee fragments it and distributes to the spymasters of the double agents. At the end of the chain, the spies have no sense [Nigel West] The D-Day landings is a little bit like a jigsaw puzzle. You're not showing the picture to your enemy. What you're giving him And these pieces don't just fit together. They overlap, and that overlapping and it means that one piece of information authenticates And you leave it to the enemy that they're already [narrator] Little by little, in parallel to the real one, in which the allied armies are and ready to attack the Third Reich Spreading the deception One of them will push his commitment Code names: Garbo on the British side, Alaric on the German side. Juan Pujol Garcia, a Spaniard, is one of the British crown's best His career begins in 1939, [applause] Revolted by totalitarianism, he decides to take action as he relates in his memoirs [Garbo] I yearned for justice. From the medley going around and around in my head, I must do something, something practical; I must make my contribution [narrator] Tamara Kreisler and one of the heirs [Tamara Kreisler] I don't think decided to become spies. I think it was more the circumstances They were very young, they were dreamers. They had suffered a lot so for them I don't think it was just but it was like &quot;we have to do something we cannot let the world [narrator] tried to contact But the allies send They then approach with the aim The Germans recruit them as early as 1941. Under the code name Alaric, Garcia begins to provide information, Except that he has never set foot [Nigel West] He had managed just outside Lisbon called Cascais. And from there he pretended and that he had recruited who was traveling on a regular basis and this was the explanation for why Alaric's letters because he said this courier would deliver them [scissors cutting paper] [narrator] train schedules Alaric invents himself and sends dozens of letters He and his wife they pretend making him the head of a network of spies that exists only in their imagination. They actually created without ever hearing [Tamara Kreisler] I mean if you think about it It's a pretty peculiar concept [narrator] In April 1942, the English finally notice who earned the trust of the Germans. Juan Pujol Garcia and he joins the Double Cross network [Nigel West] by the British Security Service was that his case officer thought He would, as we say, He was a brilliant actor He would take three pages to say something [narrator] Under the direction Garbo quickly expands creating 27 imaginary agents. [Robert Wallace] one of the questions I would say is: how did you keep I mean, keeping 27 agents in balance and so they don't look That is a very disciplined element A small mistake with one of his sub-agents could really destroy the whole operation. [narrator] Thanks to constant vigilance, to maintain the ruse Day after day, they perpetuate the disinformation business alongside other double agents, [music from the 1940s] [Treasure] ...Listening on the days agreed. I also mention I noticed a considerable number of American soldiers and officers [narrator] These are the words Born in Russia, raised in Paris, she offers her services to the Abwehr Like Tricycle and Garbo, and intends to betray the Germans As soon as the German secret services she applies to MI5 From now on, And Treasure for the allies. But when she settles in England, Treasure makes an unusual demand: she wants her dog Babs [violin playing] [Nigel West] Lily Sergueiew A very unusual woman. And one individual that she had a long-term relationship And she had no understanding that there were very strict because the UK unlike the rest of Europe So absolutely under no circumstances until Babs had completed So a big problem. But it was agreed and that Babs would go into quarantine [narrator] Treasure works hard When the Germans send her she sees during her travels, [dramatic violin music] [Nigel West] collected their information But what they really needed for somebody to go into the local village and to see the shoulder flashes or the insignia on the tanks The mere observation in a particular place on a particular date has the effect of authenticating [dramatic violin music] [narrator] pass thousands of small And to make sure these lies are effective, the British secret service the Blechley Park Decryption Center. [violin music escalates then stops] [narrator] Here, more than 8,000 people The men of the Reich can keep no secrets [Nigel West] You can watch a message delivered by Garbo to Madrid and you can follow the same message And then you can see sending a message perhaps a questionnaire seeking more information which is then transmitted to Garbo The huge advantage of being able is that it was a guarantee and believed the information [narrator] The intercepted messages the double agents have won In May 1944, a month before the landing, the Reich's secret services are concentrated mainly The Germans position their armies putting their three key divisions But here is the real position massively gathered a little further west, ready to attack the beaches of Normandy. Now, to maintain the deception the double agents intensify [Bronx] Send 50 pounds fast. [dramatic music] [narrator] Its sender: Elvira Josefina Concepcion Alias Agent Bronx. [indistinct excited voices] Daughter of a rich Peruvian diplomat, she is known for her partying, seduction, An excellent cover This mundane telegraph hides The sum of money actually denotes the target of an upcoming Allied attack. The Bay of Biscay, north of Spain. The reference to her dentist denotes her level of certainty Finally, the urgency of her request indicates when this attack On May 15th, 1944, in a month, around June 15, an attack will definitely take place [T. Ryback] you have this SS panzer division, a very consequential unit. And when this message comes through, So basically, that paralyzes a very consequential unit A full SS panzer division sits in place waiting for an invasion that never comes. [narrator] The landing is imminent, But suddenly, the unexpected happens. Johnny Jebsen, and member of the misinformation network, is arrested by the Gestapo. [Nigel West] He was suspected rightly of having embezzled The problem was: would he try Would he disclose Would he compromise Dusko Popov? Juan Pujol, code named Garbo, because it became clear had reached Jebsen. So all of this was in the balance and that created a major crisis [narrator] The British Security Service Then, almost at the same time, MAY 17th, 1944 [Mary Sherer] When she visited Lisbon she had fixed up which she had not told us about She refused to divulge [narrator] This report is written by Treasure's case officer. She reveals that Treasure is threatening Why? The death of her dog Babs crushed by a truck [Nigel West] Lily Sergueiew Herself and her dog. And in terms of motivation, she was extremely angry To the extent There was a danger perceived by MI5 that she might tell the Germans that actually [narrator] Jebsen's arrest and Treasure's threats plunge the Double Cross committee [phone rings] Operation Bodyguard teeters on failure. But too late to call it off. The committee stops Tricycle's activities, and prevents Treasure They decide Garbo is too valuable On the night just a few hours before the landing, he transmits a message [Garbo] He wrote to me 3 days ago of cold rations and vomit bags After the Third Canadian Division had left Rumours having reached him that the Third Canadian Division [sea water fizzing] [narrator] In this letter, Garbo announces It's the truth, the ultimate poker hand [boats crash into the sea water] [Max Hastings] to get Garbo to send a message on the night of D-Day saying the Allies are coming [narrator] Garbo keeps An indispensable ruse as the Allied ships the Nazi general staff still believes [dramatic music escalates] [falling bombs whizzing] The morning of June 6th, 1944. The big day. [bombs exploding] [splash] 8,000 warships moor off Normandy, and 175,000 men storm the beaches. [gunfire] Meanwhile, in Germany, [T. Ryback] which was his mountain retreat And on the night of June 5th he was actually watching movies Goebbels left around and then Hitler And no one was to disturb him. Hitler himself had anticipated but that it would be a diversion So when news of Normandy came, you didn't want to wake him up that would prove to be a diversion. Then you realize that in one of the most consequential moments, [gunfire] [narrator] On the beaches of Normandy, In the first 24 hours, are killed, wounded or missing. But the German defences gradually fall. No reinforcements Jebsen and Treasure [gunfire] On the evening of June 6th, Allied armies must now advance [gunfire] [M. Hastings] is although in the eyes of the world, June 6th, this is the big day, It was not that simple. The planners had always expected that the key battle will be and that if the Germans after D-Day more quickly by land the Germans could still win the battle. And so, a huge amount the Germans moved their armored divisions [narrator] For now, the Germans believe They still expect a major attack But how long will they believe it? [Nigel West] After the 6th of June 1944, you might think But that was just the first half. The second half was equally as important, and it was to maintain the fiction at any moment in the Pas-de-Calais. [narrator] all the agents still in the race They cannot be more explicit. [Garbo] From the report mentioned that the present attack is I never like to give my opinion to justify my assurances. [Bronx] Only part of Allied force bulk remains here at present. [Brutus] FUSAG was, as I reported, but it is obvious now [narrator] This last message British codename: Brutus. As a former officer whose real name he was recruited as a double agent As D-Day approaches, he becomes an essential player [Nigel West] In 1944, he was attached which was the supposed headquarters which first of all confirmed and secondly gave an opportunity to be passed to the Germans [narrator] Agent Brutus sends His mission: make them believe that FUSAG, the fictional army he is a part of, [Brutus] some soldiers They were currently attached Northern regions of Harwich seem to be prepared [violin music escalates and stops] [narrator] Given the deluge the Germans feel confident. The lie endures for days, and even weeks. [falling bombs whizzing] [Timothy Ryback] to finally tumble to the fact that there was not going to be I mean even in July at the Pas-De-Calais than at Normandy. Finally on the 27th of July, are sent from the Pas de Calais a month and a half [gunfire] [M. Hastings] One of the many things is the allies biggest hope was they could just and then they thought they might maintain German uncertainty And what is incredible The Germans went on and on leaving so Fortitude was as successful but far more successful than they had ever dared to hope [explosion] [narrator] when Hitler finally gives the order to send reinforcements to Normandy, The allies are already And on August 25th, they liberate Paris. [gunshot] The fighting continues for many months. Reich armies are sandwiched between Allied forces in the west On April 30th, 1945, and Hitler commits suicide in his bunker. A week later, on May 8th, The Second World War Still today, the landing of June 6th, 1944 ranks as one of the most remarkable But history has almost forgotten the extraordinary misinformation campaign [Nigel West] or been disbelieved the consequences and failure might have meant that we'd be conducting [Hastings] sustain brilliantly confusion And the coordination, it was undoubtedly one of the great The double agents, the wireless deception, the false information all the rest of it, [dramatic music [narrator] the double agents aren't even aware Most leave England [Nigel West] After the war these agents Garbo ultimately went to live in Venezuela and was employed by Shell Oil ended up running Tricycle Dusko Popov became a CIA agent, operated in the European Community as the Director of Brutus became a printer and operated a small print shop Lily Sergueiew married and went to live with him Bronx, Elvira De la Fuente, just opposite one of the best hotels [narrator] For years, the story of these has remained highly classified. But little by little, to reveal these spies to the success of this [narrator] the Third Reich had extended its influence But on November 8th, land in North Africa Once settled in Maghreb, the next step gain a foothold in southern Europe already suffering heavy losses For this operation, codenamed HUSKY, the Allies target a little island Launch date: July 1943. The stakes are high. If Operation Husky succeeds, leading to victory for the allied forces. [Bailey] the largest, In other words, combined attempt So, it was a huge enterprise. It was going to involve Tens of thousands of aircraft. Tens of thousands of vehicles. [narrator] But the allied headquarters the Germans anticipate and have readied their defenses. [Kislenko] The German high command was absolutely convinced that somewhere in the Mediterranean after their campaign in North Africa. So the Germans focus on First and foremost is Greece. Other places are places like Sardinia, or Corsica. And then of course Italy. But of course the question is, precisely which one [narrator] the allies must force Hitler In great secrecy, Churchill assembles An ultra-secret organization and British intelligence personnel. Their mission: to craft a diversion plan that the attacks will happen not in Sicily In Kew, a suburb of London, the documents In top-secret files, two names stand out: Charles Cholmondeley and Ewen Montagu, both members They concoct a plan Its name: Operation Mincemeat. This document details Montagu They want to drop into the sea a corpse dressed like a British officer The body would carry suggesting an invasion The goal: to let this false information [Kislenko] and using it as a deception tool the invasion of Southern Europe, On a balance of probability, in 1942, '43, It's so insane that it's brilliant. And it's also really really cool. It's got all the elements you could a dead body that's disguised, It's a fantastically interesting story. And there's no question in my mind the entire operation Mincemeat, if not the most important [narrator] Cholmondeley and Montagu to implement this crazy plan. Each detail must be carefully prepared. [Robert Wallace] as in the case of the Mincemeat represents a one-off type of operation So in that sense, or any particular formula You're almost, in every instance, [narrator] The first step But there's one essential requirement: [Kislenko] needs a body that nobody cares about it If you take a corpse or dies in a particularly public fashion, There are going to be people there are going to be people There's all sorts of really mundane things that would throw the entire There's also even in the midst of World War II, people are worried about doing indignities So they need a corpse It's a very sad, morbid occasion, No questions [sea waves flowing] [narrator] pass as a man The condition of his skeleton, his lungs, Every detail matters [sea water and drums] They enlist the help In these times of war, corpses And yet, [pencil scratching against a paper] [pencil scratching against a paper] [pencil scratching against a paper] According to Montagu's report, after 2 months of looking in vain, The coroner and pathologist [Montagu] at St Stephen's Hospital, Fulham, His name was Glyndwr Michael Two days earlier [narrator] who lost his parents and apparently No-one seems to care Did he die from Was it suicide? Nobody knows. But for the forensic pathologist fits the storyline [Peter Speth] The rat poison that is known to occur, Actually, the liver undergoes which means death of the liver cells. Even under the best of circumstances, it is rather difficult But if you now add to that the idea that the body will begin to undergo decomposition and putrefaction, then it is highly unlikely to even think of [narrator] a death by rat poisoning British intelligence feels confident: with a cause of death so hard to detect, the idea of a death by drowning The body of the homeless man held at a temperature of 4 degC - 39 degF According to the pathologist at the time, Ewen Montagu and Charles Cholmondeley so that he can accomplish First: Create a credible identity. [Bailey] that the courier they were going to use to be holding documents like that. So they choose And that's a reasonably senior rank, the sort of person that you'd expect Another reason why they could choose is that they could You don't have to bring in a specialist And therefore, if you do that, Because how can you trust the tailor to keep the secrets So here he is: a corpse who's a major and finally with a name. The hero of Operation Mincemeat born in Cardiff in 1907. He just needs a face. [Arne Kislenko] so they get a guy the same age group, in order to take a photograph, an MI5 officer and his own identity temporarily, wearing the same suit in order to appear [narrator] But to be credible, a private life, a personality... what spies call Who was he? How did he live? Who were his friends What did he do on his final days in London before leaving on his mission Cholmondeley and Montague step into the shoes They plant clues coins, an open pack of cigarettes, a pair of keys, two bus tickets, even a photo of Pam, He carries two used theatre tickets and a bill from where he stayed until April 23rd. This makes it possible Everything stops April 24th, the day he's meant to fly... and crash. [Arne Kislenko] They have made Michael, a Welsh vagrant they make him a real person and that backstory is painstaking. It's a very interesting moment the mental acuity of the planners, and then you also really see They put artefacts that gives you a very rich tapestry. [narrator] The invented life Now Cholmondeley and Montagu to determine the exact place where the Germans will find it. They know the spot: [Bailey] Spain during the second world war However, it was quite closely aligned Franco, who's in charge in Spain, And the reason why the allies wanted to was that they felt very strongly that the Spanish will actually that come into their possession, [Ryback] There was a man in Huelva who was an excellent German spy The Germans knew it and they felt that if they could it would end up in the right hands. [narrator] Huelva is on the route Major Martin's itinerary takes shape: flying from London to Algiers, off the Andalusian coast where Major Martin Now, Cholmondely and Montaigu need to find the best way and most of all... in the perfect location to assure it's found [Bailey] for how to deliver the body One of these was to land it by, But that was dismissed because once it being dropped Another suggestion was to drop it by ship. But again, the danger there was It could be seen by the shore. Another idea was landing it But in the end, the decision was taken A submarine could and then it could just gently and then leave without being seen as well. So, in the end, [narrator] The submarine H.M.S SERAPH on April 19th, 1943 for North Africa. It's a perfect schedule: along with the documents he carries. Those crucial documents... The fictitious Major is supposedly flying so he carries letters intended for To justify the letters must be both personal [Mark Kelton] it's not the big failures that get you, The people running this operation that any detail that was checkable and it had to fit with the story and had to be What can the Germans who would be in Major Martin's position? Do the British have couriers like this? Are there staff officers like this? Is there a reasonable plausibility that a person would be and then somehow be killed? And that [narrator] After many drafts, writes the first letter The recipient: his friend General [General Nye] that the 5th Division for the assault and that a similar reinforcement should Jumbo Wilson had proposed to select [Bailey] because it's in this document is outlined as Greece. That's the deception that the allies The letter is to suggest that is actually going to Greece; and that the Sicily operation, Mentioning the word Husky in the operation because that suggests if they ever come across that or through their own spies. That's a real operation, It might seem risky to use but actually, [narrator] To complete the story, [Bailey] The second letter It is written again by very senior and it's a letter introducing Major Martin to Admiral of the Fleet, Cunningham, who is a very senior It is designed to convince the Germans that this is a real man But there's also which is also built into the deception, [Nye] as soon as the assault is over. He might bring some sardines with him. [Arne Kislenko] one of the most risky but also It's a reference to the fact possibly entertaining Where the brilliance comes in the Germans understood British humor, so it's this kind of I know what you know [Ryback] It's interesting when you think dreaming up these operations. In some ways that's even deeper than just piling up military equipment this one is the ability to think your way and into Hitler himself. And to deliver those things that ultimately was wrong. [narrator] But Cholmondely and Montaigu if the two letters in Major Martin's uniform pocket, they could slip out Losing the letters They decide to add a third letter accompanied by The pamphlet, justifies the use of [Bailey] was that they wanted They wanted it to be found. They wanted the Spanish to find this briefcase [narrator] they attached it This will also reinforce To simulate death by a plane crash, our man is decked out With every detail of the plan in place, the prime minister Winston Churchill [drums] [Arne Kislenko] is an aficionado of intelligence. He thinks it's big, he thinks it's clever, And of course, he had hesitation, because as he famously said, would believe we were coming to Italy. But the Germans were foolish, that they're going to actually buy it [narrator] get approval on the American side who grants an authorization [telegram] Chief of Staff gives full approval MINCEMEAT. [narrator] [violin music] On April 17th, 1943, Cholmondeley and Montagu According to official reports, the two men slip all the objects and attach his briefcase [violin music] The corpse is then placed But for some, especially this scenario doesn't hold. Glyndwr Michael's cadaver has suffered since his death 3 months prior. [violin music] [Peter Speth] In my opinion, when Montagu to get the body out of the freezer, &quot;Oh my god, we can't use this body. What are we going to do? The stench would have been [bombs exploding] [narrator] Glyndwr Michael never left London. [explosion] At the last moment, might have replaced his body who died a few days earlier in Scotland when the aircraft carrier [Bailey] and the documents as a source and it's impossible to know I do think you can understand the drowned body That would have been perfect. Certain things puzzle me a little bit I think there's room for speculation, And we have to remember and the deception may have continued It's difficult to know. [Kislenko] Part of me says, because of course the British government Had you employed another body ethical, legal considerations so I understand And this is a world of conspiracies, so I suppose I get it. All that being said, from people that have spent is that it was in fact Glyndwr's body. So barring any release of government we are sort of inclined which is super interesting. [narrator] the submarine HMS Seraph on April 19th at 6 o'clock. But whoever he is, he carries with him [submarine going through the water] [violin music] 11 days later at 4:15am, along with five officers surface and come out on deck. They're 1,500 meters where they drop the corpse [seagulls] Early in the morning, an Andalusian fisherman discovers the body [seagulls] He brings him to the coast But things will not go according to plan. [Kislenko] The British plan had basically or somebody in the water in Spain, turn it over immediately to and it would end up, contents included, The problem is refused to turn over the body, [narrator] Even worse: decide to conduct an autopsy: the first test [Peter Speth] According to Montagu, when they found out by ferry up the river to Huelva, and that the medical examiner They were assuming, particularly because they made the body that the body would simply be looked at, and then be buried. They had never counted on a forensic pathologist [Kislenko] in the sense that they did exactly they have questions One of them notes that it appears than a regular body would, Which is of course exactly what the operation was designed So there's this enormous tension how this has been digested [narrator] As the Spanish doctors some other details puzzle them. One is the position It appears to be much further back than Will the doctors conclude is not the man in the picture? [Arne Kislenko] the receding of the hairline and movement of the skin on the scalp, and the effects of the salt in the water So, what the autopsy does as opposed to an autopsy saying but at the same time providing answers. [narrator] Despite the questions the Spanish authorities reach Officially, the man drowned at sea for 8 to 10 days before being found. [Ryback] to want to believe it, and to overlook I think had there been a thorough autopsy something very different, get it together, and get it up to Berlin you know with the Fuhrer. [narrator] On May 2nd, in the presence of British army officials. But British intelligence now faces instead of giving the briefcase after the autopsy, the doctors [Arne Kislenko] The navy is far less to the Germans and Italians and there is a kind of sense which you can understand. And not everybody in Spain let alone to the idea There were quite a few people in Spain than of the Axis powers. [narrator] to give the British Major's briefcase On the German side, the race begins Adolph Klaus, the most active spy But not one officer All he receives is a detailed list of the documents For both sides, the Spanish loyalty The briefcase leaves to be handed over But the Reich agents don't give up At least... that's what they believe. On May 8th, 1943, pro-Nazi Spanish officers unseal The operation is extremely delicate: the British authorities cannot find out that the letters Once opened, who have less than one hour [camera taking pictures] The Spanish officers carefully return [narrator] They immediately The Fremde Heere, is responsible At the head of the investigation: Alexis Von Roenne, With his team, he scrupulously studies But something doesn't add up. According to the body spent 8 to 10 days in the water But in one of Major Martin's pockets at a London Cabaret Club [Timothy Ryback] with the intention the Germans interpreted this as an event and did the math on it and said, this must before he left London, and they can't they can't square the condition of the body with the fact that a couple days earlier [narrator] For the Brits, the invitation And now it's about to [Robert Wallace] In the Second World War and if a counterintelligence service they will pull that string [narrator] Alexis Von Roenne The local Abwehr office replies that there is absolutely no doubt But the Germans aren't convinced. Some of those closest to Hitler, of this seemingly god-sent information. Thankfully though, within the secretive powers only one man has the last word. [Timothy Ryback] what Goebbels or anyone else thinks it's what Hitler thinks and when it ends up on Hitler's desk, [Arne Kislenko] failure is not really an option. If you manage to upset somebody especially Hitler, chances are So, no matter how intelligent it's horribly undermined So, all of this leads the Germans and believe what they want to believe. [narrator] that the allies are preparing But meanwhile, England has no idea the Germans finally arrived [phone rings] It's been days since surveillance teams And they found no messages [Arne Kislenko] up for the next few weeks I would sort of characterize it because everything could go And it must have been agonizing, coming from either So there's tension, there's confusion, about what could go wrong. And again, it's because there are invasion plans which are at stake here, so it's a big stakes game. [narrator] two weeks after the long-awaited signal finally arrives. [Cholmondeley] from an absolutely reliable source were projected in the near future in both the Eastern [narrator] The ploy seems But the landing in Sicily is scheduled The lie has to endure. So, the allied secret services to misinform [Bailey] The British use or agents of their own, who are For example, in the UK you have fake observations of Allied movements to suggest that they're preparing In North Africa, there was also The 12th Army, with 12 divisions, That was using things like inflatable trucks or from the spies there were soldiers who of course were not really but were part of a fake division. There were Greek currency, Greek guidebooks and were in circulation in North Africa was actually destined for Greece. So a huge amount of effort a make-believe army [troops marching] [Kilslenko] is to liken it to a jigsaw puzzle, an enormously complicated jigsaw puzzle One out of place could throw And in that sense, the intricacy, from planning everything about the body into the German intelligence system It is lunacy. [typewriting] [narrator] But it works. In early summer, Hitler orders 18,000 men from the 1st Panzer Division in France They are joined And minefields are installed In Sardinia, and send ten more armed divisions The Fuhrer's message we know about your plan to attack But the allies do attack On July 10th, 1943, 160,000 men and 600 tanks [Bailey] When the invasion came, the first lines of resistance many of them were Italian soldiers. And it became quite clear that these were And this, I think, is also evidence the Germans, the Italians, did not feel So they put troops in the front line there [airplane moving on the ground] [narrator] The Allied assault [airplane taking off] On the same day that the fighting 21 fighter planes leave the island [motors roaring] [Timothy Ryback] the invasion will come and even after the invasion he sees this as a diversionary action, still waiting for the big attack [explosion] [narrator] After several weeks, the allies on August 17th, 1943, ending the campaign in Sicily. For the Nazi empire, this breach During the following months, and, in 1944, before ultimately where Hitler will commit suicide. [Bailey] The campaign in Italy because it draws German forces away and it draws Germans forces away after the Allies land there in 1944. So, it soaks up enemy resources, and that's exactly [narrator] Today, seeing the full scale operation Mincemeat And yet, the scheme, is unprecedented [Ryback] You could write a novel but the combination but also the insight and the luck all combined to make and consequential outcome saved tens of thousands of lives. [Ryback] Mincemeat is an example inventiveness, and just and can think up It is an operation that, I think, we might take it almost for granted, but if you put yourself in the shoes of it's an amazing thing to have thought up. It's a fantastic success [Kislenko] These two men, at their core, They're really no different or whoever else in today's world, who are so creative to make [celebration] And they were blessed to have a team, and that includes high political leaders who, whether through decided to put it into play. And it works magnificently. [narrator] Like a grain of sand the plan crafted by played a crucial role and changed the course of the war. [Kislenko] There are so many things military, political thinking, economics... but yes, in a very real sense, this operation it allows the Allies to get a foothold to make vulnerable the German defenses, And it puts Germany on the defensive So ironically, an unknown Welsh vagrant becomes the most important man Sure, I think there's some reason [narrator] Without having ever existed, Major Martin contributed Today his body But the British government [heroic music] Glyndwr Michael, &quot;The man who never was&quot; a Welsh man who, without ever knowing it, saved thousands of allied lives [Nikita Khrushchev speaking] [John Fitzgerald Kennedy speaking] [Nikita Khrushchev speaking] [John Fitzgerald Kennedy speaking] [narrator] In the early 1960s, and Soviet Union Secretary General berate one another [Nikita Khrushchev speaking] It's the height of the cold war and the world is In the West, In the East, the Soviet block Separated by an iron curtain, with the threat of atomic weapons. Suddenly, in the heart of the Caribbean, turns up the heat on the Cold War. It's name: Cuba. [J. F. Kennedy] Within the past week, unmistakable evidence that a series of offensive missile sites on that imprisoned island. [narrator] On October 22nd, 1962, President Kennedy declares the immediate establishment to halt any new weapon deliveries. The news hits like a shockwave. Will the two world powers triggering World War III? [Arne Kislenko] If Khrushchev decided there's every realistic expectation And given the circumstances, in 1962, the chances that that would have escalated [Kennedy] and that is the path Our goal is not the victory of might... [narrator] President Kennedy remains remarkably calm. His secret: located in the heart of soviet power. In Moscow. [John Fitzgerald Kennedy speaking] [narrator] The key to averting nuclear war begins one summer night, when strangers meet A man enjoying the view and two American interns, returning from the Bolchoi ballet. [lighter clicks] The gentleman asks for a light and then approaches them [Major] and I want you The man he identifies at the American Embassy in Moscow. &quot;And I want you [narrator] Then he disappears into the night. [Major] Cox and Cobb are sitting there Well Cox says, I'm going to take it down. Cobb's says, No, this is a setup. I want nothing to do with this. So, they parted ways. And then Cox took a taxi [narrator] Here, at CIA headquarters, the most sensitive archives Most are classified &quot;top secret&quot;. But among the documents handed off were two identical, typewritten letters Originally written in Russian, they were [Oleg Penkovsky] My dear Sir! It is your good friend a friend who has already become for the ideal of a truly free world government, and people I ask that you believe At the present time I have at my disposal of exceptionnally great interest [narrator] The letters aren't signed. Who is this mystery man Enclosed with the letters Still classified today, it gave the C.I.A. [Major] When they open up the package they find a photograph of a man in and an arrow and in there also is the photograph that had been [Randy Burkett] we're going to be able to look back we'll be able to and we'll be able to figure out It was a good ploy on his part. [drums] [narrator] Thanks to the photograph the CIA quickly tracks down Colonel Oleg Penkovsky. During World War II, rose through the ranks of the Red Army. In 1949, he enrolled where future agents the Soviet Intelligence Agency. At just 30 years old, Then after starting his career in Turkey, for Scientific Research His mission: to gather technical knowledge [Arne Kislenko] On paper, he's an emblem of the Soviet regime. His rise, you know, is very consistent with many people in similar levels And in other facts, he's a kind of He's a shining example So the initial reaction is that this guy has got to be a plant. He's got to be he's working for the KGB It's too good to be true. [narrator] Despite the risk of a trap, the CIA sends an intelligence officer If the man's motivations are honest, the West would have its first mole an opportunity impossible to let slip by. In the spring of 1961, The businessman hosts a delegation At the head of this small group At the Mount Royal Hotel, he's expected in Suite 360 [Randy Burkett] Joe Bulik and George Kisevalter, because he was famous but also his way And then there was Shergy Shergold So, he had four very experienced officers [narrator] The interrogation begins. [David Major] In every human operation you get a new source. Your first question is, In other words, is he legitimate? Is he who he says he was? And is he doing it for the reason he says? Or has he been sent In the business, So, they're going to start very friendly debriefing as to how he comes to be with these four intelligence officers. [narrator] During this first meeting, the officers learn within the GRU has recently stalled. His problems started While on assignment in Turkey, he denounced the head of the GRU station But instead of listening Moscow buries the case Soon after Penkovsky returned to Russia, And what they discovered [Penkovsky] by the Chief of the Personnel Directorate He said, &quot;This is what you have declared and this is what we have found out You said your father simply died.&quot; This is because my father [narrator] had fought alongside the Tsar against the Bolshevik revolutionaries It's a serious offense. [Randy Burkett] Had this come out earlier, Once it came out, they determined he and his family Penkovsky was coming up and he had this tainted He was going to get retired, he believed. He was never going to He was never going to be among those that really had access to the best And so Penkovsky saw himself that he had to build up such a credit that when and if he got retired, that he would be able [narrator] During the first meetings, the officers very intricate personality [Arne Kislenko] about what Penkovsky's motivations were. Not every expert on Penkovsky what was the principal trigger. Oleg Penkovsky is a curious figure. He was profoundly arrogant. He may have had delusions of grandeur and where he could serve And we know from almost every account, That one of his motivations that he was treated unfairly And there's no question once Khrushchev became the official. He detested Khrushchev, it's not well documented but he came to the assumption in his behavior in foreign affairs, So, between those two things, or motivation, to betray. [Major] so he's very concerned about what he's going to do So he's very concerned about He sees himself as a patriot and he says somebody needs to know [narrator] During his stay in London, Penkovsky holds a series of meetings 16 interviews take place over 15 days, [Burkett] and meet for 52 hours and not be missed he would come not just for his family And so what we would do, is we would fill his shopping list giving us secrets and then and he would have these shopping bags: ah ok, everybody understands He's out buying all of those things that everyone back in the Soviet Union [narrator] These hundreds of pages reveal specifics about the GRU, It's an organization because he's inside. [Burkett] The technical documents He compromised names, photographs later on. That was wonderful. If we'd never had after that first group, I mean, the amount of material [Kislenko] The Americans and the British are absolutely stunned about He is the golden goose. He has a wealth of information [narrator] he must also wrap up [Burkett] At the end of the 52 hours, the four officers realized that But they also had a resource into the most difficult [Major] Immediately it was decided that they needed to have so that they could pass information This is very very dangerous to do on the surveillance team of the KGB So, it's very difficult But the decision was they had to do it. [heels clopping] [clink of keys] [narrator] Back in the Soviet capital, Oleg Penkovsky continues With his official passes, he can access the Special Collection This is where the regime keeps about their military arsenal development. The CIA provided him with a &quot;Minox&quot;, a miniature camera, [click] [click] [Melton] During the World War II, the Minox camera for copying documents Number one, it was very small. Number two, at a time in which something so small to fit in your hand The third thing was and it could focus easily you could take a picture With between It could go from your pocket, it automatically would cock you looked at a document, get it It's just literally done in seconds. And it was used by all of the major intelligence services [narrator] For days, the spy photographs [door opens] Penkovsky sends the microfilms Greville Wynne, the organizer [raining] [door opens] [door closes] [narrator] between the East and the West, so for M.I.6 and the CIA, In 1961 between early May and late June, Penkovsky delivers The originals But these lists issued by the CIA [Burkett] He had access to this document and that top-secret level journal, was where the Army the KGB and the GRU would truly debate the tactic and where things should go So that was unique. It was so good that here at the CIA through the 1980s on how to look at a country, [narrator] The CIA officers decide it's time to disseminate But in order to protect under no circumstance From here on out, the spy's name The intelligence he has provided as if from different informants. [Burkett] one compartment called IRONBARK the documentary material and another one called CHICKADEE. And CHICKADEE it was the GRU material, on various aspects of the Soviet Union. And we would create lists, right that said these people had access to CHICKADEE. Some people had access to both. And even in discussions internally or in messages back and forth We would use cryptonyms. Even internally, we kept trying to ensure and see that this one guy [narrator] Among the information one topic will turn the range and power According to the new double-agent, the U.S. has highly overestimated [dramatic music] [rocket launching from the water] [rocket swishing through the air] [narrator] By the late 50s, both the USA and the USSR [dramatic music] Each side is also racing to construct with the longest range The US is convinced of Soviet superiority in what the leaders [Kislenko] In 1960, the United States is basically blind. It has no real understanding of Soviet it doesn't know anything about systems and it has belief that Soviet missiles that they are way further ahead and importantly that they're So this missile gap psychosis, this you know conviction and the Russians are ahead of us is what Kennedy assumes [narrator] Oleg Penkovsky suggests that the dreaded &quot;missile gap&quot; He claims the majority of the Soviet Nikita Khrushchev [Penkovsky] In such large questions and attacks with strategic weapons, he lies and puts out what he wants Believe me, he lies like a grey stallion. [narrator] Penkovsky's information makes its rounds to prominent figures But the secrecy surrounding Especially as Penkovsky's disclosures contradict the most deeply held beliefs [Kislenko] The orthodox interpretation up until Penkovsky's revelations, are that we are trailing that the Soviets have a far better particularly missile system capacity and that goes all the way through all the way to the American intelligence, So now in effect everybody to change their viewpoints and some people There are members of the US military It has to be or at the very least, And I suppose it's fair to say and some of them it doesn't serve their interests. In the 1960s, behind the US military and its acquisition So, nobody in that complex that Penkovsky has flipped the idea the Soviet Union no longer being [narrator] intelligence authorities decide to from President Kennedy. But at the same time, Penkovsky now has a new contact Janet Chisholm, and married to a member of M.I.6 [Burkett] Janet had been So, she wasn't totally a trained officer especially in those days, [narrator] On this day, Penkovsky is supposed with seven microfilms [Burkett] where he came out, sees the kids, She takes the box, leans back, and immediately brings out a real box, And he goes on his way. [narrator] The CIA The contents pertain to a city since World War II: Berlin. After the surrender the victors divide the country. Berlin, the capital, but the Allies decide To the East: the Soviets. To the West: Berlin is the only place on the globe where the two world superpowers [Kislenko] two ideological, facing off over a couple of streets It's a strange situation, And the only reason that is because they become somehow complete with police vehicles a British, a French, an American You know, the abnormal But that doesn't negate two colossal superpowers in a very small location [narrator] the world wakes up astounded running 97 miles long and 13 feet high The German capital Friends, couples, entire families The outrageous move shocks the Allies. After Russia's unexpected move in Berlin, Oleg Penkovsky gives to the CIA Nikita Kruchtev plans to kick the Western allies [Lector] A recent report from a source, judged at this time to be reliable, will be brought to in exercices &quot;of unprecedented scope&quot; [Burkett] What Khrushchev has threatened That he was going to sign That he was going to close off That this was literally And he was going to do it within a year. [narrator] But in his reports, after revealing he asserts that the United States should stand firm Considering the high risk Allen Dulles, head of the CIA, decides it's time [Kislenko] Chief amongst that information was the idea that Khrushchev was bluffing. And repeatedly, Kennedy heard that Khrushchev was full of bluster. That everything that Khrushchev was in effect just a giant bluff. To disguise the fact that it actually was militarily weaker, had no real intention So, in that light with a kind of confidence. [narrator] The Americans are now convinced that Soviet military superiority President Kennedy finally decides to follow Penkovsky's advice [Kennedy] The people of West Berlin It is the objective of our policy [narrator] On October 21st, 1961, the US Deputy Secretary of Defense gives a public statement It was not filmed, but the text has been [Lector] because the Soviets We have called up 150,000 reservists, Our forces are so deployed and protected that a sneak attack We have a second-strike capability as what the Soviets can deliver [Kislenko] The speech by the American is really a landmark occasion: it articulates the fact one from a conviction to the reality And this is really one of the first times both American and international, [narrator] that they no longer believe On the Soviet side, it's a reality check: it's because someone In the most watched-over the vice slowly starts At the end of 1961, Penkovsky continues sharing intelligence unaware of the intense surveillance on him Was he exposed by a Soviet spy who There are numerous hypotheses, In January 1962, Penkovsky sends a memo alerting his case officers They end their rendez-vous in the street, opting for brief, But what Penkovsky doesn't realize It's him. The Soviet Secret Service They have his apartment And even search it when he's out, [Major] How do they go into the apartment I heard this from Yuri Nisenko who was the who actually was involved in the case. He defected to the United States But he told me personally, he says, I said, What's that? It absorbed into in through his clothing And so, we had to get him So, when he's in the hospital, When the KGB entered his apartment, they were able to find his camera They were able to find the one-time pads that were used by him to encrypt So, they were to find that only a spy organization would have. [narrator] The trap closes around But despite the risks, Oleg Penkovsky continues his work And he seems to have reached a peak in his frenetic attempt [Burkett] he did too much, he produced too much. When you think about the fact that he stood at the military academy, taking 8.000 He was so convinced he was so driven and he was going to prove he lost that self-preservation sense [Kislenko] he wanted to be [narrator] to share thousands of pages Because, as his treason comes to light, one of the biggest crises in a small country Cuba. [Cuban music] In 1959, the Caribbean island when Fidel Castro and Cuban guerrillas The new regime angers Washington And in 1960, they cut off all diplomatic relations [sound of flying airplane] On October 14th, 1962, an American reconnaissance airplane In one of the shots, there appears to be what looks like In total secrecy, with the blessing of Fidel Castro. In the days that follow, US reconnaissance Along with the launch sites, and nearly 40 missiles [Kennedy] Good Evening my fellow Citizens. This government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet Military buildup Within the past week, unmistakable evidence that a series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation [Burkett] Kennedy has to make a choice. And Curtis LeMay and all of these They're saying, look, We should invade Cuba and become true threats to the US. Kennedy argued that if we just suddenly invaded Cuba How is the world going to look at us? Kennedy is looking for an option. [narrator] President Kennedy Many of them are stamped &quot;IRONBARK&quot; which indicates they are based on [Lector] There are now 22 surface-to-air nine of which are believed to be individually operational The initial firing Refire from a single launcher will take [narrator] The nature of the missiles, their power, their range, Because of Penkovsky, the American authorities [Major] It is a direct result that allows the United States to know Which is almost every part And he also knows how these In other words how long it's going to take So, it is Penkovsky's information to know how much time he has to [Burkett] Kennedy knows he has, most estimates before the first set of missiles Now, down the road he still had an option: if he tried to quarantine he could still go forward [Kennedy] A strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. I have directed the Armed Forces It shall be the policy of this nation launched from Cuba against any nation as an attack requiring a full retailatory response [drums] [narrator] Kennedy announces a quarantine on Cuba and a blockade of the island [Major] Kennedy decides that is face saving for the Soviets So that's when they come up to stop any more missiles We knew, through imagery, That it wasn't over yet. So he said, We got to stop the delivery So that's when the Navy was given [narrator] The US authorities and forbids any Russian ship to cross it. Violation would be considered [Kislenko] a naval quarantine as what he called it, is really a fairly unprecedented challenge both in international law of Russian missiles coming into Cuba, The problem of course is you actually have to honor it, so the likelihood of a Russian vessel escalades the risk of war. [narrator] But a diplomatic solution mostly thanks to Penkovsky. Because, in all of his memos, Khrushchev is bluffing. [Penkovsky] Kennedy should be firm. Khruschchev is not going to He is not ready for any war. I respect and love the United States and I certainly, in Kennedy's place, [Kislenko] Penkovsky's constant message through everything is this notion That in almost every single respect, the Soviet Union is basically [car motor rumbling] [applause] Now it's a paper tiger so you can only take that so far, it changes the dynamic [Kennedy] I call upon chairman Khrushchev to halt and eliminate and provocative threat to world peace and the stable relations Our goal is not the victory of might Not peace at the expense of freedom here in this Hemisphere, God willing that goal will be achieved. [door shut closed] [narrator] the spy Oleg Penkovsky The Americans but they don't know it yet. Two days later, on October 24th, at Khrushchev's order, 12 boats turn back. The rest stops in their tracks. The tension reaches a peak. This line drawn around Cuba before a thermonuclear war. On October 26th, the Soviet leaders ask to negotiate, [Major] They wanted to set up with the United States to find out That we'll pull away. And so, they activated a KGB resident And they set up a back channel that they can exchange information And we basically say we will stop the You're just going to stop your armada. You're going to take them back. And then quietly we'll take, [narrator] Secret negotiations But during this time, and each side holds its position. Everyone is on alert, Finally, on October 28th, and promises In exchange, the Americans agree And secretly, 15 nuclear warhead missiles The crisis is over, Kennedy comes off as the winner. He stayed calm in the face of hostility. On the other hand, accused by his own side of retreating. But the one truly defeated in this story, In May 1963, Penkovsky was tried At the end of the hearing, and executed on May 16th, 1963. [gunshot] This brilliant Soviet officer In just 18 months, and radically changed the balance Experts are unanimous: Oleg Penkovsky played a crucial role in resolving [Kislenko] at a most critical moment the Cuban missile crisis, to have an understanding So, what that means is that you're not far off if you say Penkovsky [Kislenko] He paid the ultimate price, but the ambitious Colonel Oleg Penkovsky becoming one of The one who helped save [Major] This guy was and had the right motivation to give us actually in a very short period of time. Having taught espionage I know of no human source [Burkett] He has to be considered if not the greatest spy of all times, [narrator] Arlington Hall, the home After the end of World War II, these men and women to decipher the coded messages The Soviet Union. [phone rang shortly] [Klehr] Of course, the United States But there's a great deal of mistrust The United States government knew that the Soviet Union The FBI had begun several investigations of Soviet espionage in America. So, the relationship was, but there was a very strong [narrator] The task is enormous. Agents intercept thousands that pass between Moscow and the Soviet But in 1946, thanks to a new, brilliant the team manages that dates back to December 2nd, 1944. The text cites 24 names. Names that no one would imagine [West] What was significant is they were probably the most secret because all the names who were engaged in the Manhattan Project. [narrator] The Manhattan Project: supposedly The program to build In Arlington hall, the discovery How could the Russians have known eight months before the US dropped After decrypting this telegram, American counter-intelligence services to discover how deeply the Manhattan Project And most of all... [huge applause] [narrator] May 8th, 1945. The end of the 2nd World War and traumatized [applause continues] [narrator] In July 1945, representatives of the United States, meet in Potsdam to decide the fate Churchill, Truman and Stalin appear But behind closed doors, the seeds of discord [West] In global strategic terms, the principle concern that the Soviets clearly had ambitions, not only to extend from central and eastern Europe, [narrator] At an impasse, the Soviet bloc controlled by the USSR and the Western bloc Between them, an impassable iron curtain. [West] I think the Potsdam Conference was the first major manifestation [narrator] In this delicate the Americans for the moment [click] Just a few years earlier, in 1938, the world learned that a German physicist and its tremendous potential [huge explosion] Several countries launched But none approached the scale Codename: &quot;The Manhattan Project&quot;. [Alex Wellerstein] The Manhattan project is the project where the goal is not &quot;Can you make an atomic bomb? No, the goal is to make atomic bombs and that requires billions of dollars, creating essentially [narrator] More than 30 sites join this colossal endeavor. Among them, Oak Ridge, dedicated to obtaining uranium 235. Hanford, Washington state, Developing and building happens in a once-sleepy town [Cindy Kelly] It was very isolated. But once the government came and decided this is where they wanted to have their it did not appear on any maps. Suddenly it was not allowed to speak There were military police on horseback The Soviets they don't invest heavily in research, Germany, France, During the Second World War, the USSR set up Men and women on the payroll of the NKVD, infiltrate the highest posts [Robert Wallace] The Communist ideology, had a particular attractiveness to a wide And the Soviet intelligence service and finding people that then subsequently were in mid-level and in the various elements of [Mark Kelton] is an interesting phenomenon. Of course, you had the Great Depression. There were many reasons people and Western society in and of itself who saw and Moscow is offering another answer. That was the fertile ground [Nigel West] There was a belief, that the Soviet Union [Wellerstein] They believe that that wants to take over the world so for them that might lead to a better world. [narrator] The American nuclear program Spies infiltrate every research site... Despite the drastic security measures, the best-kept secret in the United States [heels tapping against a pavement] This is Klaus Fuchs. Born in Germany, he fled at the beginning of the war and pursued [Wellerstein] While he's in the UK, who are involved with And they, basically, over some time, to give them copies of his work. Some of this is, again, even before it's kind of a coincidence Once he gets pulled in on that, He continues to work on it. He is one of the most brilliant people [narrator] In 1943, comes to the United States And Klaus Fuchs is among them. The Americans are not the only ones [Kelton] He comes to Great Britain, gives him shelter What does he do? and he takes that espionage activity and starts spying on the Americans. [Wellerstein] The spies during the war United States versus the Soviet Union. The United States Fuchs is seeing it more like Fuchs is helping fight the Nazi's [narrator] In February 1944, the man with the green book named Harry Gold. [West] Harry Gold is a Swiss born chemist. And he has been engaged for a long period of time for the Soviets. Steeling processes, steeling intellectual Harry Gold's sole function is to act as a courier, Klaus Fuchs is supplying information He doesn't know Harry Gold then passes it on to So, it's a cut-out if you like. [typewriter clicking] [narrator] Between February and June 1944, Klaus Fuchs drafts Top-secret information which he shares with Harry Gold. The original documents are still classified as top-secret, but his spy work is confirmed by this It appears under its codename: REST. [Lecteur] has demonstrated We consider it necessary the due reward of 500 dollars. He fully deserves this sum. [narrator] The Soviet intelligence agency Then suddenly, during the summer of 44, their recruit receives Fuchs leaves New York to join the Theoretical Division [Wellerstein] He's put in charge relating to the implosion weapons, because he's very, He's also put on problems relating to how Some of the original that are foundational have his name as an author. So, he's not minor in any way. [narrator] Klaus Fuchs occupies And he is one of the few scientists to benefit [Wellerstein] knew almost nothing And there was sort of and that is These were meetings that would be held They would have many of these meetings, and Fuchs was allowed With these meetings, he knows about Problems they're having in parts These help him a lot You really can't imagine if what you're trying to learn there's really no better spy He knew everything. He was involved with everything [narrator] The spy Klaus Fuchs is invaluable But in Los Alamos, [David Greenglass] Darling, I have been Dear, I can see how farsighted I have come to a stronger belief in [narrator] These words were written by in a letter sent to his wife in June 1944. He's a mechanical engineer and is preparing to join the engineering A longtime communist sympathizer, he is recruited as a spy [Wellerstein] She was married to [narrator] Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. The couple has been a part of the New York One of their missions So, when they find out that they deem him an ideal candidate. [a spoon clinks against a plate] In the Autumn of '44 when Ethel and Julius Rosenberg Their goal: to persuade her to convince Several weeks later, Enclosed is David Greenglass' decision. It appears under the codename KALIBR [lector] OSA has returned KALIBR expressed his readiness to help in throwing light on the work [narrator] Camp-2. On December 16th, 1944, Greenglass becomes an undercover spy He doesn't have and has less access [typewriter clicking] [lector] He has given us a hand-written plan and facts known to him The basic task of the camp which is to serve as the detonator. [narrator] This NKVD telegram gives a glimpse of A map of Los Alamos, but also The classified information begins to flow. Out of sight, draft detailed reports on their work. Filling pages and pages Copying the plans of various bomb parts. And smuggling out [car door opens] [car door shuts closed] On June 2nd, 1945, Klaus Fuchs meets in Santa Fe On this day he provides a detailed plan of the plutonium bomb, It also reveals that the first US tests The following day, not far from Santa Fe. He has a meeting with David Greenglass The documents Fuchs is one of the main suppliers [Nigel West] that the Soviets received was absolutely essential all the dead ends, all the red herrings. They saved not having to pursue So, they had all the benefit [Mark Kelton] and why do they take the decision to spy If somebody decides to betray their county People that decide to do these things, Either they believe themselves above risk or they have and this is going to be [narrator] gradually pass into 250 scientists and technicians find organizing the very first [huge explosion] [narrator] On July 16th, 1945, a powerful explosion, equivalent to The atomic mushroom Shortly after, the United States But on July 28th, the Japanese government [airplane taking off] On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb 70,000 people are killed instantly. Just as many are injured. Three days later the U.S. launches This time, 40,000 deaths. With its back against the wall, For now, of this new It assures the Americans But what they are about to discover In 1946, just a few months after the war, the men and women of Arlington Hall work tirelessly The Russian secret services the &quot;One-time Pad&quot;. First, it's a question of converting into a series of numbers based on a straddling checkerboard The numbers Then a one-time pad Only the sender and the receiver The numbers of the same column Then the tenth digits are erased. Here's the message as sent. To decode it, the recipient will use and most importantly, the same [Keith Melton] Even the most powerful cannot break a one-time pad message if it's done correctly a random number. Only two copies, destroyed immediately after it's used. The user adds, the receiver subtracts. And the fifth: the length of the key needs to be equal And with those five conditions in place, [narrator] For months, struggle with these But in early 1946, a new recruit His name: Meredith Gardner. This brilliant linguist duplicates in the single-use code sheets. Extremely small series of found in several telegrams. [Harvey Klehr] Once the Soviet Union the intelligence traffic They're sending And thus, This is the pre-computer age. Today if you want to generate and it can generate random numbers It was a lot harder to generate random numbers And they couldn't manufacture enough. So, they decided, How likely is it So, they began to reproduce and slip them into new one-time pads. [narrator] Gardner cracks And learns has been compromised down [Nigel West] Now, the interesting point is that the scientists who had been worked there at Los Alamos, under alias. So, although some of them were even they operated under alias. [Harvey Klehr] Here's a Russian cable naming the American scientists Names that were not publicly known. So, this was the really on the part of American intelligence that the Soviet espionage [narrator] work relentlessly But decoding new telegrams takes time. [applause] Meanwhile in the USSR, the nuclear research program Starting in 1945, the ranks swell to nearly And on August 29th, 1949, in Kazakhstan, the Soviet Union [explosion] [narrator] The USSR becomes [Cindy Kelly] The atomic bomb was probably an exact replica that the United States From everything we know, that they received courtesy of espionage of the American and British work The information [narrator] Realizing the extent the Americans ramp up their efforts renaming it the &quot;VENONA Project&quot;. Gradually, they decode more messages plunging into absolute and utter horror. The original documents stashed in the secure archives of the NSA. But in recent years, by Meredith Gardner and his colleagues Among these thousands of pages is this telegram involving text [lector] On 5th February a meeting LIBERAL, referring to expresses the wish that our man and interrogate him personally. [narrator] GUS, REST, LIBERAL, Code names found All of them associated with what the Soviets call a.k.a. the Manhattan Project. [Kelton] it was certainly monumental and American national security. Before that, of course, or did not want to see that that during the war they'd used that time [narrator] A network of Soviet spies has uncovered the United States' U.S. intelligence starts a relentless hunt to flush out the men FBI special agent Robert Lamphere He sifts through the decoded telegrams [West] It became clear whose code names were, first of all, Bob Lamphere was able to which indicated that Charles had traveled over Christmas 1944 And by going back to Los Alamos and checking the furlough records and to see who had been given leave it was possible to narrow down and then ultimately had a sister living in And on that basis and he became the focus [narrator] Meanwhile, to work on the British atomic project. So, the Crown's secret service [Nigel West] The problem was to extract some kind of evidence but that would not compromise the decryption program was still running and there was still that was being intercepted So, the key was and this was done that was conducted by MI5 in a pub. Over a period of Klaus Fuchs started to compromise himself. [narrator] The spy Klaus Fuchs During his interrogations, discover the shocking extent [Wellerstein] and a follow up confession Fuchs tells them that he gave pretty much everything to do He gave them all of the dimensions, so we're talking about what's what surrounds that, what is the principle, what is the math. This guy gave everything he remembered, [Mark Kelton] He was an ideological man your sort of mild-mannered scientist, but in fact he was When he's nice to people at Los Alamos, &quot;These are all nice people. but they really don't recognize that the And that's probably [Nigel West] that the information that he had been was of universal nature and should not just have been [narrator] The first link And thanks to Fuchs [typewriter clicking] The next suspect on the list The Soviets refer to him During interrogation, the New Yorker, Harry Gold in a photo. Arrested in May of 1950, And the dominos fall, one by one. [Nigel West] In order to save his neck, hat he had serviced as a courier And David Greenglass was interviewed He had a choice of really compromising either his wife Ruth or his sister, Ethel. And he identified as a Soviet spy And that of course [narrator] became one of the most famous The telegrams decrypted under But at no time [Klehr] in any court proceeding during this era. The United States government that it had partially broken There's an irony here because within a very short time after the Venona breakthroughs had been achieved because they had a spy [Nigel West] was based really on including of course David Greenglass. [narrator] Despite the proof, the Rosenbergs refuse to cooperate [narrator] By far, the Rosenbergs, who became public face pay the highest price While they receive the death penalty, Klaus Fuchs is sentenced David Greenglass is sentenced to 15 years... And Harry Gold, 30. But they only represent woven by the Soviet Union As the months go by, other code names More looters of classified information. But who are they? In 1951, as the Rosenbergs are tried, the cryptologist Meredith Gardner sent from New York to Moscow [lecteur] BEK visited Theodore HALL, He is a graduate of HARVARD University. As a talented physicist According to BEK's account and a broad outlook At the present time Hall is in charge H. handed over to BEK and named the personnel He decided to do this on the advice a GYMNAST living in TYRE. [narrator] It's a big break for the FBI. They identify Theodore HALL, still working at Los Alamos, And, also Saville Sax, one of his friends. Codenames: STAR AND MLAD. [Nigel West] of a very young spy And he used Saville Sacks as a courier. It is clear from the Venona traffic and passed a lot of information to them, [Wellerstein] Hall is the youngest member of he feels like he's pretty smart and he's getting to be with all those but he also worked for the Soviet Union. If you're 19 that sounds very exciting. So he's changing the world [narrator] After identifying the two men, how to approach them without divulging [Nigel West] After a long period both are picked up on the same day And confronted with the allegation Each not realizing he goes to considerable lengths and not implicate the other. [Wellerstein] They figured out that against Ted Hall and as a result He dies a free man because without making it clear [narrator] Not until the declassification does anyone know about [Cindy Kelly] The irony is that scientists at Los Alamos was it all in vain? I mean it was certainly by the actions of these individuals. [narrator] Some experts believe Ted Hall and the other &quot;atomic spies&quot; Others insist they tipped the planet Either way, there is no going back. [Nigel West] I think that you can say of espionage being conducted [explosion] This provided the Soviets Which dramatically changed history. So, it's hard to exaggerate the influence, [Wellerstein] The Manhattan Project as the best kept secret of the war. And then you find out that it's That's one of a couple things that really makes it seem impossible in which the United States are going to somehow Everybody just starts making So, it's very profound. [narrator] and the theft of the atomic bomb plans escalated the tension Suddenly, it was not about but how to avoid nuclear war. In the 21st century, on both sides of the Iron Curtain revealing a story and which transformed
