This video features sudden jump scares and intense sound design, which may not be suitable for all audiences. Viewer discretion is advised. [Dramatic music] He's still coming! I am not okay! If you've ever been alone in a cave, you've probably heard this. [Cave Sound] Where'd that come from? That was a cave sound, and a guy named Gargan thought it would be a good idea to give that sound a source. Needless to say, people have immediately latched onto this idea, and ever since watching that video in the middle of the night, [Cave Sound] Where'd that come from? I've wanted to try it out. Fortunately for me, my friend Ferret decided he was up for an adventure, so we put together a mod pack and set off on the journey. This was our first real experience with the cave dweller. So naturally, it went... flawlessly. You know what we need? We need diamonds. Ten whole diamonds. Uh, we gotta save the environment, protect nature. It's very important. This is what I think about you, and your nature. [Gasp] NOOOOOOOOO It's getting dark, so we should probably get into a cave of some sort. For safety. Yeah, from Herobrine. I mean... Yeah! [Growling] Oh gosh, I keep hearing noises. What the heck? That does not sound like a normal cave noise. There's something groaning out there. Hello. Hey, how's it going? [Laughs] Knock, knock. Who's there? It's the government. Ah, yeah. Hat. I can save myself from getting further brain damage. [Laughs] I don't think there's any saving you from that, buddy. I'm sorry. Uh wait. What? Let's go this way! Hey, can you put your furnace down? You mean, you mean, you mean this furnace? Yes, that one right there. Do you mean, do you mean, do you mean this, this, this? I don't even know. Yes. [Laughs] Yes, I do. I do, wanna, can you put the coal in there too? Do you mean, do you mean this? [Sighs] Okay. Hey, guess what? What? Shoes. [Gasp] Are those the Gucci... The Ugg boots? I, I'm so... The Gucci Ugg boots. And that's where I leave you. Goodbye! Never to return, because now I need to tell you about my Apex Gaming PCs partnership. Instead of what I normally talk about though, I want to tell you my favorite three things about Apex. Number one, their PC configurator is an incredible tool that helps PC nerds like me spec out the exact machine that I want. Number two, whoever runs their Twitter is an absolute gem. Go follow them. And me. Go follow me too, but, but also follow them. Knarfy? Number three, starting a PC build with something that is already set up and guaranteed to work makes upgrading really, really easy. Even though I really like computers, there's some things that I just don't like to mess with. Especially cable management. Knarfy? Apex is great, and we've created three different rigs for you to get started with if you're looking for something new. You can head down to the link in the description and use my code &quot;Knarfy&quot; for up to $250 off when you finance or purchase a new computer. [Jumps] Whoo! And that's all I have for you. Thanks again to Apex Gaming PCs for their partnership. Now I need to go find some sheep and, uh, I guess shears. Hey, you got iron, right? You mean... you mean this iron? I swear? [Laughs] Alright, we gotta find some diamonds. [POP] [Grunts] Nice. Ow! Uh-oh. Okay, wait, hold on. Okay, okay. Shield, shield. You got this Knarfy! I believe in you! Uh, do I? Uh-oh! Should we make a more secure area to put our beds instead of just putting them out in the open? Probably. Hey, do you have coal? Um... you mean this- this coal? Stupid. Wow, this- wow, this cave is insane! What the heck? Ooh. I heard a thing. You need to get your ears checked, bud. Cause I don't hear anything. This is a freaking diving board right here. YOLO Oh, I regret. I regret. I instant regret. I insta- regret. [Laughs] [Screams] Where are you? [Gasps] Cover me, cover me, cover me. I've- I've got some issues here. I've already got five. Oh gosh. What is that? What? What the- Ah, a zombie! Oh my gosh, it's gone! No! Oh! Nine. Nine diamonds, dude. Nine? Ah! Ah! Ah! Okay. Alright, cool. Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh no! Oh no! Oh! Oh! Oh no! Oh no! Oh! Oh! Oh! No! Oh no! What? Oh! Hey! Huh? What? Yo! What's up? Yo! [Panics] Uh oh! [Gasp] I wonder if I could survive this. [Laughs] Oh! All the diamonds are down there. Water bucket clutch, let's go! YO, I got it! I can't believe I actually got that! Uh oh! Uh oh! Yeet! Yes, dude! Oh! The diamonds! [Sighs] Safety. Maybe. Oh, gees this- No! The diamonds! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Ooooh. Ooooh. Run, Knarfy!! [Laughs] Its still coming! What the heck? [Panting] Oh my gosh, how did I do that? [Laughs] NO! N-N- N-N-No! NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO! Why is it still chasing me? Why is it still chasing me?! Why is it still chasing me?! (Gasping) Knarfy! GIMME A SHIELD! (Gasping) Gimmie a shield, gimmie a shield, gimmie a shield. Do I have a shield I have my own? I have one shield! (Laughing) You have picked up the diamonds though, right? Yes! This is STRESS! (Laughing) I just spotted him. I just spotted him. I just spotted him. He's right there. He's right there. Oh. He's right there. Oh he's right there. Why is he sitting like that? And this was the end of day one. Ferit and I had enough and logged off for the day, but we had a question lingering in our minds. Could we defeat the cave dweller? Honestly, neither of us were really all that confident, so we came up with a plan. We created a new world that included a data pack so we could craft an enchanted golden apple. Using that, we felt we had a fighting chance at defeating it. And so now, the hunt was on. Oh, there's a mine shaft! - Wait, how much gold do we need? A lot. - 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63. - Hey I got a name tag. Do you reckon we can- Do you reckon we can rename this name tag to idiot and then rename the creature that's like following us at the moment? - It would be very funny. If you managed to name him idiot, it would be very funny. - I'm literally picking up all this iron just so I can make an anvil to try and do that. (screaming) (explosion) - We got two gold blocks. (screaming) - I just heard a I just heard a horror sound effect and then just ran. - Oh, he's still coming! - Oh my gosh. Don't move. Stay right there. Stop looking at me like that. Stop looking at me like that. We're just hanging out. - Well. (laughing) (gasping) - Gosh, that was the most terrifying. That was real. - There's more iron over there. - Well, I was thinking we actually keep going this way and kind of continue into the depths of that. Did I punch a bat? - Yeah, you just successfully without trying just backhanded a bat. - So I found this. - Oh. - Yeah, this is definitely interesting. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, what the heck? What the heck? Whoa, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'M GONNA DIE- (laughing) - All I could HEAR was AHHH And then it just carried on. - He just comes out of nowhere. - I still find it funny how he keeps targeting you. I'm sorry that I blocked the entry way, but. - I was dead anyways, It wouldn't have helped. - Oh my, you fricking get out of here. GOOO! (laughing) - It'd be kind of ironic if it decided to pop up whilst we were putting our stuff in our chest now. - Better freaking not. - I'm on my way, I'm on my way, I'm on my way. (laughing) - All right, well, I guess I'll just continue with my work as if nothing happened. - God, he really is not happy with you, Knarfy. - Apparently, I don't know what I did to upset him. Oh, no. (screaming) Well. (screaming) Uh oh. (laughing) - No! - Oh, half a heart, oh. Definitely did s- (laughing) I made a little safe, hovel over there. (dramatic music) Oh, yep, see that's why. Oh, oh geez, run, run, run, run, run, run, run. Run, run, run, keep running, keep going. I can't attack him, I can attack him. Before this moment, I honestly didn't know if it was even possible to damage the cave dweller. Early on in the recording, I'd even said this. Well, he doesn't really, you know, take damage. He can still die though, right? Yeah, but I don't think to players. But I was wrong. This was possible. So it was time to gather our final materials and take this creature down. Oh gosh, I just keep hearing. So, oh, I see him, he's behind you, he's behind you. Oh, my sword broke. Yeah, should we get ourselves some diamond swords? Probably, yeah. Let's go back. I've still got the name tag, I just remembered. Oh yeah. Oh, I also have a name tag. I wonder if we just go for one golden apple instead of two. But the question is, who's gonna take on, who's gonna take on the dude though? All right, okay. Type in chat like what you're about to go for and we'll go one, two, three, shoot. Yep. Okay. One, two, three, shoot. Ah. (laughing) One, two, three, shoot. Yeah! Looks like you have to take him on. (sad music) We need two more blocks. I think we actually have all the gold we need. I wanna get at least enough iron to name the fool. Oh yeah. You watch now, the moment we get what we need, he's not gonna pop up anywhere. (laughing) No kidding. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hello. I'm running, I'm running, I'm running. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh now he's going for you. Oh good. He's really not happy with us, dude. No kidding. You know, honestly, I wouldn't be that happy either. Okay. I'm gonna go get more iron. Um. (screams) (roaring) Oh jeez. Oh no. (laughing) I just saw, I walked around the corner saw that happening, jeez. He took half of my fricking health. Wow. There, enchanted golden apple ready. Amazing. We just need the iron. He seems to be targeting me a lot more now, so I don't know how I feel about that. You wanna take him on? You wanna do that? You know, you wanna? Well then someone has to name tag him though. Okay, I'll take the, I guess I'll take the apple. There we go. (laughing) (laughing) That's incredible. What did you rename? Nothing. No, no, show me. Show me, what do you rename? I didn't do anything. I think he's ready to find us now, Knarfy. I think I think. All right. I guess I'll take the apple. All right. Ready? He's behind you. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, perfect opportunity. Wait. Eat the apple! I don't have the name tag. Get him, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him. IDIOT!! KILL HIM! YEAH!! Get him. (laughing) DIE! DIE! YEEESSSSS!! YEESSSS! (celebration) (laughing) I can't believe that we actually pulled that off. (laughing) Honestly, I didn't think we would be able to do it. I honestly did not think we'd be able to get him, but we did. I was worried that you were gonna kill him too quickly. Oh man, that was solid. Well, you wanna leave and never return? Yeah, let's get out. Yeah. Yeah. Subscribe!
