CONGREGANTS: And with A reading from according to Matthew. CONGREGANTS: Glory to You, &quot;Jesus went about all teaching in the synagogues, and proclaiming the good news and curing every disease, When He saw the crowds, because they were like sheep without Then He said to His disciples, 'The harvest is plentiful, Therefore, to send our labourers Then Jesus summoned and gave them authority to cast them out, and to cure every disease These twelve, with the following 'Go to the lost sheep As you go, The kingdom of Heaven Cure the sick. Raise the dead. Clean the lep--Cleanse Cast out demons. You receive without payment, The Gospel of the Lord. CONGREGANTS: Praise to You, It's a very much...a reading for those who are looking &quot;Receive without payment, And this is, we all receive but giving without payment and that's something And especially as we look how Jesus freely gave--of God, gave freely Jesus to us, to show us the way to Heaven. And in our first reading there's a beautiful a description of what And of course, way before the time of Jesus, and actually, before the Babylonian exile. But Isaiah could already see new life after exile. And this is something, as we live in exile but we can have And when conversions happen, then we grow and we start to give freely, one of those who recognizes but the labourers are few, and so we all are called uh, and, and gather But of course, it takes time to nurture, to let the Holy Spirit do what the Holy Spirit does till we become self-less, not care about their own but to give to others. And today's Saint, is such a beautiful Saint Ambrose, who actually and so he was, he was groomed to be a leader, came from and in 374, at age 35, he was not even a Catholic, he was not even baptized, by popular acclamation, chose him to be because he basically and, and he had which very few people had. And... ..so he was chosen bishop, he was baptized, and he was, uh... ..made a bishop But he really embraced He was not really, he did not but he embraced it. And so, he, he, uh... ..embraced a aesthetic, a very aesthetic lifestyle, He got rid of his, um, belongings, of his assets, A real conversion, and becoming a labourer Just overnight, almost. Within one or two weeks, and he became in a very difficult time. In a very difficult time, when the Arian was very much, um... ..going on, and it was very political, and the Arians tried even his--Milan, They tried to take, overtake and he fought back, and really--really being a labourer for Christ. And of course, Arianism, ..uh, it, it that Jesus was not God, And so of course, Arianism has moved into, where Jesus became a prophet. But for us, and Saint Ambrose ..defended that. And with logic arguments. He, he, he had, uh... ..he had, was smart, and with logic he could, uh, And this is also To, our times are We hear all kinds of and to educate ourselves to know our faith, and the more the more we also And I don't mean that, and, and, and, but when we are challenged, when we are we can reason back and say, &quot;We do this because, We can explain our faith, and the more we grow the more we the more we we become people for others, as an old Jesuit slogan &quot;People for others.&quot; It's not about me anymore, And we are on the road Amen.
