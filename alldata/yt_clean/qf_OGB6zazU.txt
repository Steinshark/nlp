WHEN I THINK ABOUT TIME, ELATED IN THAT TO TRY TOUCH THE FABRIC OF REALITY. DEPRESSED IN THAT TO TRY TO IN RAW SPECULATION. WHAT IS IT ABOUT TIME THAT IS THE REALITY OF TIME COMMON PERCEPTIONS? WHAT IS TIME? I'M ROBERT LAWRENCE KUHN, AND TO FIND OUT. PURUSING TIME, I ATTEND A SPONSORED BY THE FOUNDATIONAL PHYSICISTS AND COSMOLOGISTS WHO AND VENTURE BEYOND. THE CONFERENCE CRUISING FROM NORWAY TO DENMARK. SAILING IS NOT SMOOTH AND BUT WHETHER FROM THE TOSS OF THE I CANNOT TELL. I MEET THE BERTRAND-RUSSELL AT CAIMBRIDGE, AN EXPERT AT HUGH PRICE. HUGH, THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL THING MANY OF MY PHYSICIST FRIENDS IT SEEMS TO ME IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUT OF SOMETHING ATEMPORAL. THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO IS WHAT WE MEAN BY TIME, AND IT'S BETWEEN THREE PROPERTIES TO BE GOOD REASONS FOR THINKING PHYSICAL WORLD, BUT COMING FROM THERE IS THE IDEA THAT THERE'S A THE IDEA THAT THERE'S SOME KIND AND THE IDEA THAT TIME HAS WHAT PHYSICS GIVES US IS &quot;BLOCK UNIVERSE&quot;, WHERE TIME IS SPACE-TIME. WHEN SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT TIME TALKING ABOUT THE FIRST HALF. SO, THEY'RE JUST EXPRESSING THE SPECIALNESS OF THE PRESENT TURN OUT NOT TO BE I THINK THEY'RE PROBABLY RIGHT WHAT YOU MEAN BY TIME, THAT'S THE CLAIM THAT TIME IS NOW, THERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT IT'S NOT FUNDAMENTAL, WHICH UNIVERSE PICTURE OF SPACE-TIME, ACCORDING TO WHICH, SPACE-TIME IT'S EMERGING OUT OF SOME SO, YOU WOULD SEE NO FUNDAMENTAL FUNDAMENTAL, AND WITH SOMETHING FLOW OF TIME EMERGING FROM TIME COMPONENT AT ALL; I CERTAINLY SEE NO PROBLEM WITH ORDINARY TIME, LIKE FLOW AND THE ARE SOMEHOW SUBJECTIVE. SEEMS TO ME, THAT NOT ONLY DON'T I THINK THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR WELL, WOULDN'T THAT AFFECT WE ALWAYS THINK OF CAUSE AND BE A RAID IN TIME. I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, IS THAT OUR NOTIONS OF TO SOME EXENT, SUBJECTIVE. SO, OUR SENSE THAT CAUSATION IS, AT LEAST IN SOME DEGREE, PERSPECTIVES, AS AGENTS; AS IN THE WORLD TO ACHIEVE ENDS, OTHER OUTCOMES. I THINK THE RIGHT APPROACH, AS A KIND OF PICTURE THAT PHYSICS THAT'S THE 4-DIMENSIONAL, AND THEN ASK, HOW DO WE FIT CAUSATION INTO THAT? IN PARTICULAR, HOW DO WE FIT CAUSATION, THE DIFFERENCE AND ITS ALIGNMENT WITH THE AND I THINK THE BEST ANSWER TO THAT THERE'S A SUBJECTIVE CAUSATION TOO, SO IN A SENSE, THE TEMPORAL PERSPECTIVE I CANNOT OVERSTATE THE CLAIM: BECAUSE WE ARE WITHIN HUMAN PERSPECIVE, WHICH GIVES MOMENT, FALSE FEELING TO THE AND FALSE SENSE TO A NECESSARY WHAT ABOUT OUR ORDINARY HUGH WAS RIGHT TO ASK. SUBJECTIVE, HE SAYS, TO OUR CONSISTENT, BUT CONVINCING? PERHAPS I SHOULD TRY TO BE TIME IS AN ILLUSION. CAUSE AS SUBJECTIVE DOES PERHAPS I SHOULD TRY THE CONFERENCE CONTINUES IN ITS NAME TO A PROBABLISTIC QUANTUM PHYSICS. I PURSUE THIS TIME-AS-ILLUSION WITH ONE OF ITS CHIEF &quot;THE END OF TIME&quot;, TIME, AS WE EXPERIENCE, IS CHANGES THAT WE EXPERIENCE. THE WAY I LIKE TO PUT IT IS, WE SNAPSHOTS OF SEEMINGLY ONE INTO EACH OTHER. IF ONE JUST TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS, AS CHANGED IN THE PHOTOGRAPH, TIME HAS PASSED. NOW, AS PEOPLE STUDIED NOTIONS OF TIME - PEOPLE AND TO ACTUALLY SUCCESSFULLY THAT, AND THE REALLY MAJOR WHO FORMULATED LAWS OF MOTION, WELL TO THIS DAY, AND THAT ABLE TO KEEP APPOINTMENTS. BECAUSE IT DOES ULTIMATELY MAKE WATCHES BUT, WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING - WITH TIME, THEY'RE MARCHING THAT'S THE KEY THING, AND THIS THAT NEWTON MADE. UTTERLY SIMPLE LAWS HE WAS CAPTURE THAT PERFECTLY. HE CONFUSED THE ISSUE, I ADDITION TO THESE CORRELATIONS THERE IS THIS MYSTERIOUS VERY DEEP ROOTED IN PSYCHOLOGY. OKAY, TAKE IT FORWARD FROM THERE WERE TWO REALLY GREAT THE FIRST WAS EINSTEINS GENERAL MADE TIME DEPENDENT ON IF MATTER DOES TIME FLOWS DIFFERENTLY. AND THEN, TEN YEARS LATER WAS DISCOVERED. NOW, IN QUANTUM MECHANICS, NEWTONIAN ABSOLUTE TIME, AND IT'S QUITE EXTERNAL TO ON IN QUANTUM MECHANICS, SO THIS JOHN WHEELER IS THE MAN &quot;BLACK HOLE&quot;, BUT HE WAS HOW THESE TWO THEORIES SO, HE KEPT ON PUSHING BRYCE WHICH WOULD DESCRIBE IT, AND HE WAS VERY DISCONCERTED TO FROM IT ALTOGETHER, AND ON THE WAS NO TIME AT ALL; IT WAS JUST IT WAS AS IF THERE WERE LOTS OF THE UNIVERSE, WHICH IN FACT, ALL POSSIBLE COULD HAVE ARE, SO TO SPEAK, A NUMBER WHICH NOW, THIS IS ALL BECAUSE THE WAY I IS IF THERE WAS A HUGE SNAPSHOTS IN THERE, BUT SOME OF OTHER ONES, AND IF YOU PUT YOUR MORE PROBABLY THAN OTHERS. THEN, IN A FLASH, AN IDEA STRUCTURE OF THE CONFIGURATIONS NOW, WE KNOW WE LIVE IN A VERY THEN I THOUGHT OF THIS WONDERFUL THAT'S WHAT I CALL A TIME NOW, THERE'S ANOTHER MARVELOUS I'VE GOT ALL MY MEMORIES THERE, THE PAST RELIES ON TWO THINGS. FIRST OF ALL, IF I MOVE MY HAND HERE AND HERE AT THE SAME SUGGESTS TO ME THAT MOTION IS EVIDENCE I HAVE IS THE COHERENCE NOD WHEN I SAY SOMETHING, AND I SAID BEFORE. THIS IS ALL IN STANDARD TERMS, A FANTASTIC TIME CAPSULE SITTING WHOLE OF SCIENCE IS THAT THERE WAS A BIG BANG WHICH IT DEVOLVED IN ACCORDANCE RECORDS AROUND US. SO, THAT, I THINK, IS WHY WE BUT IS THIS GOOD DOES JULIAN'S TIME CAPSULE CONSTRUCTS A FEELING OF TIME? I'M STILL A SKEPTIC. COULD WHAT SEEMS SO MY PHYSICIST FRIENDS TELL I CONSIDER SPACE. SINCE SPACE-TIME, IS, IN DEEP REALITY, UNIFIED. I AM GAME TO GET WHAT STILL GO AFTER THE STILL AT THE TIME CONFERENCE, PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS OF DAVID ALBERT. DAVID, IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER TIME IN SPATIALIZATION OF TIME. SO, WHAT DOES IT MEAN? THAT IS, THE WAY TIME APPEARS IN IN THE ADDRESS OF AN EVENT. WHAT PHYSICS ASPIRES TO TELL YOU OVER DIFFERENT VALUES OF WHAT IS MISSING FROM THIS WHICH PHYSICS STARTS OUT ARE NOTIONS OF PASSAGE, THESE AND SO FORTH. WHICH, TO NORMAL WHICH, TO NORMAL THE TROUBLE IS THAT IF YOU TRY THAT THEY'RE FIT TO DO JOBS IN EXTREMELY CLEAR AND EXTREMELY IT'S HARD TO KNOW PEOPLE TALK ABOUT TIME FLOWING; ASKED OF SUCH PEOPLE IS, AND, YOU KNOW, MAYBE THE NORMAL SECOND PER SECOND, AND THE WOULD IT BE LIKE IF IT WERE INSTEAD OF 1 SECOND PER SECOND. IT'S NOT EVEN CLEAR THE CLAIM THAT TIME IS FLOWING 1 THE FEEL OF A CLAIM ABOUT HOW SOMETHING THAT'S IT'S LIKE SAYING A BACHELOR IS LIKE THAT, AND PHYSICS HAS BEGINNINGS, WAS TO GIVE AN MATERIAL BODIES MAKE THROUGH THROUGH THIS THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF SENSES MADE THAT SPATIALIZATION GEOMETRICAL, SO ON AND SO FORTH, SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION, SINCE BEEN DEALING WITH TIME AS A BEEN ABLE TO MAKE FUNDAMENTAL TIME'S FLOW, OF TIME'S PASSAGE. THIS IS TALK THAT PHYSICS NEEDS PHYSICS ACCOUNTS FOR THE FACT IN A GLASS OF WATER, THE EVEN THOUGH IT ISN'T. SCIENCE, WHENEVER IT ENCOUNTERS HAS 2 OPTIONS, OKAY? IT HAS THE OPTION OF EXPLAINING EXPLAINING IT AWAY, OKAY? IT'S THE SECOND STRATEGY OF TO THE BENT APPEARANCE OF A IT'S THE SECOND STRATEGY OF TO OUR SENSATION, OR TO OUR PASSAGE AND FLOW TO I ADMIT THAT IF I STICK WITH MAKE NO PROGRESS. TIME IS TIME, AND IT THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE IS TO DIVE EINSTEIN'S RELATIVITY, GIVING TIME A SPATIALIZATION. IT ALSO REQUIRES THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF TO CHECK OUT THE LATTER, I GO QUANTUM REALITY AND PHYSICIST JEFF TOLLEFSON. SO, IN CLASSICAL PHYSICS, WE OF THE UNIVERSE AT ONE TIME, INDEPENDENT OF THAT STATE. THEY'RE ALL COMPLETELY SLAVED, IS DETERMINISTIC. IT'S REALLY JUST LIKE A BIG THAT THERE'S NO, YOU HOWEVER, IN QUANTUM MECHANICS, MORE THAN WHAT IS THE BASIC THE WAVE FUNCTION, EVEN EVEN IF YOU KNOW EVERYTHING PARTICLE, OR THE UNIVERSE FOR THE FUTURE LIKE WE COULD SO, THIS ALLOWS ONE TO SAY THAT PARTICLE, OF A QUANTUM PARTICLE, 2 BOUNDARY CONDITIONS -- THE AND ITS FUTURE. SO, IF YOU'RE ASKING WHAT IS THE PARTICLE, DURING THE TIME IT TURNS OUT THAT THE PAST AND AN EQUAL FOOTING. AND SO NOW, WHEN YOU'RE ASKING CAN KIND OF SEE, THIS IS TOTALLY IN CLASSICAL PHYSICS. YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT THE NATURE LEVEL, YOU HAVE TIME GOING IN THE WAY THE PROPERTIES OF THE TO- THEY SORT OF KISS IN SO, YOU'RE CLAIMING THAT THE PRESENT IS EQUAL TO THE MOVEMENT THAT'S RIGHT. OUR VIEW OF THE NATURE OF TIME PARMENIDES, IN PARTICULAR, I THE WAY WE SHOULD THINK UNIVERSE EXISTS WITH UNIQUE THEIR STATE AND TIME, BUT IT'S TO THE NEXT, RIGHT? I MEAN, WE'VE JUST SORT OF, THINKING ABOUT THE UNIVERSE. HOWEVER, AROUND THE SAME TIME, A VERY DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING JUST DIDN'T CATCH ON, AND THIS YOU NEVER BATHE AND, ONE WAY OF INTERPRETING MOMENT OF TIME, IT'S IT'S NOT THE SAME OBJECT AS IT AGO, BUT LITERALLY, EACH MOMENT BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING IT GETS REBORN AGAIN AND AGAIN, POSSIBLE TO REFORMULATE OUR CONSISTENT WITH THAT IDEA? THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD DO IT PICTURE -- IS TO USE THE TIME IS FUTURE PLAYS AS MUCH A ROLE IN USING THAT, LITERALLY RECREATING THE UNIVERSE. AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. JEFF MAKES THE EXTRAORDINARY OF FEELS AND FORCES, PAST AND ON CAUSING OR FOR PAST AND FUTURE TO KISS IN BUT WHAT COULD THIS MEAN? WOULD THE UNIVERSE THEN TELEOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS? WHERE WHAT HAPPENS LATER SOMEHOW WHERE AFFECTS CAN WHAT COULD BE MORE BIZARRE? EVEN IF QUANTUM THEORY SUGGESTS EVERY PHYSICIST AGREES I GO TO CAMBRIDGE TO MEET JOHN WHO BECAME AN ANGLICAN PRIEST. JOHN BELIEVES THAT THE UNIVERSE THE FLOW AND DIRECTION OF TIME THIS IS PHYSICS OR HIS THEOLOGY? AS A PHYSICIST, I THINK, THERE'S REALITY OF TIME. SOME PEOPLE THINK THE SPECIAL THAT IN DOUBT; DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT WAYS. IF OBSERVER NUMBER 1 THINKS TIME, OBSERVER NUMBER 2 - THE B A IS BEFORE B. YOU SAY, WELL, GOSH -- TIME I THINK THAT'S A IT'S A MISTAKEN ARGUMENT BECAUSE DISTANT EVENT, OR THE EVENTS, UNTIL THEY ARE OBSERVER'S PAST. AND, THEREFORE, THAT ARGUMENT WAY OBSERVERS DESCRIBE THE PAST THE PAST -- CANNOT ESTABLISH THE SO I DON'T THINK THE BLOCK DEAL OF SPACE AND TIME I THINK WE LIVE IN A WORLD OF THAT IT'S PERFECTLY CONSISTENT US ABOUT IT. IF SPACE AND TIME EMERGED FROM WOULD THAT DO TO THE WELL, I DON'T THINK IT WOULD NATURE OF TIME. I MEAN, AFTER ALL, MATTER AND OF THING, WE DON'T THINK WE'RE NOT MADE OF IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND TIME, WOULD BE FROM A THEOLOGICAL THE CONCEPT OF GOD, AND IF EXPERIENCE TIME, IF AT ALL? THE CLASSICAL VIEW WAS THAT ALL AT ONCE. IN OTHER WORDS, ACTUALLY, IN BLOCK UNIVERSE - THE SPACE-TIME I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT. I THINK WE LIVE IN A WORLD OF THAT THE FUTURE IS NOT THERE IT OR HELP TO MAKE IT AS WE GO ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE WORLD, THEOLOGICALLY CORRECT THAT'S TO SAY, KNOWS THEM AS MEANS, I THINK, THAT GOD WILL UNIVERSE, NOT ONLY KNOW THE KNOW THEM ACCORDING TO THEIR WILL KNOW THEM IN IF THAT'S THE CASE, THEN THERE GOD WITH TIME. OF COURSE, GOD IS NOT ENTHRALLED TIMELESS, ETERNAL, UNCHANGING FAITH WAS THE SORT, BUT I INTO BEING A UNIVERSE BECOMING, GOD, AS AN ACT OF WAY, CHOSE TO KNOW THAT WORLD AND ITS BECOMINGNESS. THEREFORE, I THINK THAT GOD -- FUTURE, AND THAT'S NOT AN EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE KNOWN, TO BE KNOWN. SO, INTEGRATING THE TWO FROM THEOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW, YOU COULD EITHER, FROM THE IN THE BLOCK UNIVERSE, AS BECOMING THAT I'VE BEEN TRYING THAT PHYSICS BY ITSELF, THAT ABOUT TIME, DOES NOT THINK ABOUT TIME. NOW, WITH YOU AND I, THEY CAN WHICH SETTLE WHETHER WE GO FOR WE GO FOR AN UNFOLDING WORLD. SO, TIME IS NOT WHAT IT SEEMS. TIME IS NOT A SIMPLE UNITY STAGE ON WHICH TIME HAS VARIOUS PARTS OR WORK TOGETHER AND APPEAR REQUIRED TO DO SO. WHAT ARE THESE PARTS OF TIME? TIME HAS FLOW; TIME HAS DIRECTION, ALWAYS INTO THE FUTURE. TIME HAS ORDER -- ONE TIME HAS DURATION - A MEASURABLE TIME HAS A PRIVILEGED TIME HAS A DIMENSION, THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THESE HUMAN BRAINS THAN ACTUAL THE CHALLENGE IS THAT PHYSICS A 4-DIMENSION STRUCTURE WHERE EVERY EVENT HAS ITS SPACE-TIME, SO THAT FUTURE THAN THE PRESENT. THE ALTERNATIVE IS THAT SUPER-SPECIAL, AND THE ONE OF BECOMING. I CANNOT DECIDE. BUT IF I IGNORE TIME,
