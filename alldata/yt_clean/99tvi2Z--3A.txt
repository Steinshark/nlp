Visiting an amazing zoo in Japan! Please enjoy this trip! Good morning! I'm at Nagasaki Airport. About a two-hour flight from Tokyo. Nagasaki Prefecture is in the Kyushu region. Today, we'll take a boat and a bus from the airport to the zoo. The planes and boats are cool. An hour and a half after departure. Arrived. Nagasaki BIOPARK. Animals were there before entering the park! Welcome to the zoo. Let's buy tickets! The price was Y=2300! Credit cards accepted. You can walk around the zoo in about 2 hours. The first animal I encountered was, monkey! It's a monkey called a capuchin monkey. They are spending their time freely. There are about 200 species of animals in this zoo. There are many friendly animals, so you can enjoy interacting with them. ? Mara is time for breakfast. Next I came to the flamingo pond. Very close! What a surprise, there is no cage. Oh! They're fighting! It's amazing to be able to see the flamingos so close. It looks like a heart shape. There are also many flamingos by the water. Peeing (Don't stare so much) Let's give the flamingos a treats. Let's go. Amazing! Ouch It was more intense than I thought. Don't eat my hands. (Don't you have any more treats?) Sorry, I don't have any more. (Really?) They are also very popular with children. Flamingos are taller than children. This zoo has a lot of nature and beautiful scenery. There is a brave-looking animal over there. It's the king of goats. Bow down, humans. Interesting expression on the goat's face. It is summer now and the animals look hot. Cute red panda. (It's hot in summer) There are ostriches here. A zebra in the back for some reason. Some of the animals are bathing. They are beavers. Their oar-like tails are good for swimming. What animals are here? There were otters! They seem to be playing in the pool. Cute. The movement is also very charming. They live in herds with their families. They communicate using a variety of voices. They are very intelligent animals. Meanwhile, here is a llama taking a bath. The cold water feels good. But he still doesn't seem to have enough. Appealing to the zookeepers. (Play in the water some more.) Llamas are getting closer and closer. Silent pressure. (You think so too, don't you?) Giraffe meal time will soon begin. Here is a family of three giraffes. He is the father. She is the mother. Kind face. And tall son. They are about 4 meters tall. I envy them because I am 170 cm. A zookeeper brought a tree branch. Big! I thought the zookeeper was going to feed them,but He decided to let me experience feeding them. Wow! The giraffe is too tall and backlit She uses her long tongue well to eat leaves. By the way, this is a chestnut leaf. I just realized that I better keep my hand on it. He seems to have a hard time eating. Sorry. His mother is approaching. The parents and children get along well. A young child started playing tug-of-war with a giraffe. I will do my best not to lose too. Good! I can manage if I hold the branch with both hands. In Japan, it is rare to find a zoo that allows visitors to feed giraffes. It was a valuable experience! Oh! Strong! My hands almost burned As the leaves ran low, they both lost interest. They say they want to eat more. So the zookeeper presents a large branch. Even at this size, it is only a snack for the giraffes. They can eat as much as 50 kg of leaves a day. Excellent. Lunch time for father too. Beautiful way to eat. I came to a place like a jungle. A forest of monkeys. Let's go inside! I find a ring-tailed lemur! Cute. Squirrel monkey. They come on my shoulders. Very friendly. Black lemur. Unique cry. Most of the monkeys won't come near you unless you have a treat. Some of the monkeys are touchable. But I don't recommend it because of the possibility of being bitten What a strange sight. Let's give the monkeys a treats! They ransack my pockets. They are professional thieves. As soon as I opened the capsule, they took treats. Very quick. This is a monkey lover's paradise. But it seems to be very stimulating for children They are scared but having fun. A little monkey trainer is born. Scary! One more time! Snack is a rice snack. There was a prior customer in front of me. Come here. Nice! He's eating while keeping a wary eye on the other monkeys. I became very popular. Monkey party. But the monkey won't leave me. Thanks Monkeys. See you. (No!) That was fun! Taking a short break at a nearby cafe. The air conditioning is working! Credit cards accepted. Chocolate ice cream.(Y=380)($2.59)(EUR2.37) Delicious! When it's hot, ice cream is the only way to go. Peach soda was also delicious. This zoo is fun for the whole family. Playground equipment is everywhere. Next came the raccoon zone. They are eagerly awaiting their treats. Are you ready? (OK!) Here you go. Amazing! Like a zombie movie. (Next!) A face appeared through the gap. Look, it's over here! Too fast. Sorry, it's gone. But don't worry, they always eat something nutritious. They look cute up close. They live in a very nice environment. It is spacious and has a waterfall. Now onto the main event of this video, I go see the hippos. Hippo watermelon time runs from July 20 to August 21. Weekdays at 3:30 pm. Saturday and Sunday at 11:30am and 3:30pm. Hippo! He is Demeta. 11 years old. And She is Momo. 30 years old. Then he came ashore! Maybe he knows watermelon time. Walks surprisingly slowly. Getting into position at my own pace. (...) !!! Amazing. I can't believe that mouth could open like that. Next she came ashore too. Hippos like to bathe. I learned about it for the first time. Next to her is a man who can't wait. Start! Eating a whole watermelon in one bite! The staff lady's head is in danger! Hippo opens its big mouth and bites down on a watermelon. The hippo's chewing power is over 800 kg. It is the third most powerful in the world after crocodiles and sharks. But he is a terrible eater. He moves his mouth many times and takes his time to eat. Next it is her turn. Wow! Exciting! I was able to capture the moment the watermelon crushes But it mostly came out of her mouth Nice sound. Good! She is better at eating. After watermelon, then grass. Hippos are herbivores. They eat 30 kg of food a day. They weigh 3 tons. Hippos are surprisingly expressive. Cute. She has something on her head They trust zookeepers. They seem to be smart. Washing the grass off her face. Cleaned up! Good for you. (Thanks) Watermelon event is summer only. Please go and try it! Brushing teeth after lunch. Hippos like to be clean. You still eat Toilet after lunch. Scattering freely. They are loyal to their greed and I envy them. It would be wonderful to live as honestly as they do. And he slowly made his way back to the pond. I could hear the precious hippopotamus cry. A voice like the devil's laughter. I fell in love with the hippo even more. I'm hungry too, so let's have lunch. Arrival at the restaurant. The only restaurant in the zoo. Curry, ramen, udon, etc. Cold meat udon. Y=830($5.66)(EUR5.17), expensive for udon. But the taste is sure. Very tasty. The air conditioning here is great. Thanks for the food. The second half of the day we will see the animals that will be healed. Capybara. Hello. The site is very large. Capybaras are swimming freely in the pond. Just looking at them is soothing. Let's give them bamboo leaves. I love the laid-back vibe of capybaras. They are an animal that has nothing to do with the busy world. All right, all right, good boy, good boy. Capybara's cry is high and lovely. Let the capybaras provide some fan service. Turn around this way. So good. Massage in return. Good timing. It looks like it feels good in the water. Now next I came to see the kangaroos. It looks like lunch time here too. (How are you?) I'm fine. (Welcome to kangaroo land.) They are very friendly. Surprised! I thought it was an uncle sneezing. Muscles. Kangaroo in water bath. Legs too long and unhappy. A herd of kangaroos lives here. The many kangaroos are overwhelming. But they don't attack. They are friendly animals. Most kangaroos do not get angry when touched. Hair is hard and firm. It's time for healing. (Who is this guy?) Zoo closes at 5 pm. I came in the morning and I was shooting and I was running out of time. There are no large predators in this zoo. There was only one reptile. Alligator snapping turtle. Crocodile-like face. Shell with spines. Cool. This place is like the bird cage in Jurassic World. Birds live here. Red parrot spotted. Beautiful. Last I go to a facility with small animals, dogs and cats. Admission is until 4:00 pm. You must leave the zoo once. It was right near the parking lot. &quot;Lots of cute pets&quot; Inside it looks like this. Goat. Owl. Birds and small animals to interact with. Guinea pigs. Can I touch you? !!! It's probably better to just watch. There were also rabbits. Chinchillas. Cute form. Plus you can play with the cats here. There are as many cats as in Tokyo's cat cafes. Fluffy fur. Cute. I can't believe I got to meet these cats at the zoo. Cat lovers may want to come here first. I arrived just before closing, so I only had 10 minutes to play with the cats. Lovely space. Please check out the video of a cat cafe in Tokyo See you soon. Time for the cats to go home. Seated On the other side is the dogspace. Golden Retriever. Cute. It is a luxury to be able to play with both dogs and cats. He is very interested in the cats. Dog with a troubled face. Japanese Shiba Inu. It was fun! There were many capsule toys at the exit of the zoo. There were many other things that children would enjoy. But the crane game is exciting even for adults. So it's time to head to the hotel. Thank you BIOPARK. Take the free bus to the hotel. I managed to catch the last bus at 4:45pm. Nagasaki has a famous amusement park called Huis Ten Bosch. Today's hotel is recommended because of its proximity to that amusement park. Hotel LORELEI Hot spring and a restaurant are available. Lobby with a sense of luxury. Let's check in. It was Y=7,400 including breakfast! ($50.50)(EUR46.24) Room is on the 3rd floor. Hotel is very clean. There it is, room 307. Wonderful! What about the view from the window? Yup. Not bad. lol A double bed even though I'm alone. It's luxurious. The bare necessities. Water is free service. Toilet and bath. Today I will not use this bath as I will be in a hot spring. I am tired! I walked around all day. So I go to a hot spring. It was spacious and had a nice view. Restaurant. What to eat. Meat, fish, and everything else. Steaks and hamburger steaks are delicious. There were also alcoholic beverages. I decided on a hamburger! Nagasaki is famous for its hamburgers. Very tasty. Tomato and egg harmony. Soaking into a tired body. Fries were also delicious. Thanks for the food! Next day. I came here for breakfast. Buffet. All-you-can-eat bread and food. Western food, including scrambled eggs and bacon. A variety of salads and fruits. Perfect.
