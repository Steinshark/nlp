ARE DOING, ARE THEY LOOKING ELSE LOOKING AT EVEN CHEAPER EXAMPLE, IS MORE THAN HALF DOWN? THIS YEAR WE DON'T HAVE THE COMMENT ABOUT THE LETTER IS CONSUMERS AT THE LOWER-END CONTINUE TO SHOP AT DOLLAR TREE AND WE ARE SEEING THAT HURT MAXX AND TARGET ARE STILL IN TO GO AND WE ARE STARTING TO BIT MORE CONSUMER LOOKING TO THAT IS WHY WE HELD T.J.

A LOT OF DISPARITY UNDER THE THERE ARE SOME GROUPS WITHIN SLOWER, IN FACT WE COULD SEE A A FALL NEXT YEAR IN SOME MONTHS. NOT JUST FOR NEXT YEAR, BUT THAT IS WHAT I THINK INVESTORS COMPANIES THEY HOLD FOR CLIENTS. EQUITIES PER STRATEGY. THIS POINT, VERY ATTENTIVE TO THE STRUCTURAL GROWTH IS GREAT TO GET SOME TIME WITH PARTNER INPUT FOR THE MANAGER COMING UP, MORE CLARITY ON HOW ONE OF TRUMP'S SECRETARY -- NOT GOING TO PICK HOWARD LUTNICK AS SEEMS TO BE DIFFERENTIATING STREET FOR VARIOUS POSITIONS. PLUS, WE'VE GOT SUPER MICRO DE-LISTING, PUTTING ALL THE NASDAQ. MATT: AND FOCUSING MORE ON SOFTWARE. OF MOTOROLA. THIS IS &quot;THE CLOSE&quot; ALIX: HOWARD LUTNICK FOR THE ROLE OF TERRY HAINES, FOUNDER OF PANGEA TRUMP'S PIG OF HOWARD LUTNICK TRUMP ECONOMIC TEAM WILL BE WORK WELL ONLY IF DIRECTED -- BY THE WHITE HOUSE, AND REBELS GO IN DIFFERENT OTHER. BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE. THIS IS WHERE THE SOAP OPERA CONTINUES. SPACE ESPECIALLY AT THE HHS AS BUT AT THE SEE TRUMP TRYING TO STREET-FRIENDLY PIX. PRIORITIES ARE IMMIGRATION AND WILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO AT THE SAME TIME TRYING TO KEEP THAT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR A COME IN AND STRADDLE BOTH SIDES WE WOUND UP LOOKING AT THAT WARSH -- WE WOUND UP LOOKING WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT THE WALL STREET VERSUS POPULACE RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE TELLING WHOEVER IS GOING TO COME, THEY , BY THE THEORY OF THE DAY, IT MAKE THE DECISION. RISK/OPPORTUNITY TO TARIFFS, IN YEAR, OR AT LEAST THE SO WE THINK THE ARGUMENT WILL SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK IF HE AT THE SAME TIME YOU WILL NEED GO TO NEW YORK AND SAY, I BE SCARY FOR A LOT OF YOU IN A BE DEREGULATING AND FIGURING THE WALL STREET FOLKS HAPPY. BALANCE, BUT I THINK THERE WILL WILL, AMONGST THE STAFFERS, SO WE WILL SEE HOW THEY COULD DELIVER DONALD TRUMP'S GOAL OF SAME TYPES OF HIGH TARIFFS. SCOTT BESSENT HAVE BEEN UP HERE MANY, MANY MONTHS, NATHAN AND DONALD TRUMP CONSIDERING HE SPEECHES FOR A LOT OF THESE SATURDAY FOR THE ECONOMIC CLUB I WONDER HOW KEVIN WARSH FEELS HE HAS BEEN VERY HAWKISH WHEN AND IN BAD TIMES. ROLE I THINK IN TERMS OF STEP, YOU WILL SEE EVERY SINGLE AND SAY LOOK, THEY ARE THE QUESTION IS HOW BROAD ARE BECAUSE PRESIDENT BIDEN KEPT IN TRUMPETERS OF CHINA AND IN SO THE QUESTION IS HOW BIG ARE IS THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER GOING IT'LL START TO MATTER IF WE GET 2025 BECAUSE THERE IS A THOUGHT TARIFFS WILL BE PUT INTO THE YEAR. THAT POSITION WILL BE VERY KEY HAPPENING IN E-COMMERCE, WHAT TRADE REPRESENTATIVE IN TARA: THE ANGLES OF THE TOP OF THE NATHAN DEAN OF BLOOMBERG ABOUT CABINET FAKES.

MEANWHILE, ANALYSTS THINK THE ADJUSTMENT. THIS IS &quot;THE CLOSE&quot; MATT: BIG MOVERS OFF THE BACK OF STARTING OFF WITH THIS TALK, RECOMMENDATION TO UNDERPERFORM IT SAYS SABRE COR FACES STIFF SOLUTIONS AS IT CHIPS AWAY FROM ADVISING GOVERNMENT BOND YIELDS FINANCING COSTS IN THE 5%. ALIX: TO HOLD FROM A BUY A TRUCE. TARIFFS FROM THE TRUMP CORE CONSUMERS. MARKETPLACE MAKES IT HARD FOR CONSUMERS WHICH COULD THREATEN MATT: FROM OVERWEIGHT AT PIPER THE ANALYST CITES A HOST OF LOGGING READ TO MOMENTUM, TO MOJO -- TO ITS LUBNCHABLES AND A POSSIBLE RISK HEALTH DEPARTMENT INFANTS IN I LOVE LUNCHABLES . MOJO, WALMART. BOOSTING ITS SALES AND PROFIT LOWE'S IS DOWN 4%, IT HAD A JOINING US FOR MORE IS AN ANALYST AT AV SEE -- AT HSBC. WALMART. NOW. &gt;&gt; GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE.

PICKUP, IN-STORE PICKUP, SCAN AND GO AT SAM'S CLUB, IT IS ALL ARE OFFERING CUSTOMERS, WHICH AS TO WHO WILL GET THE CONSUMER WHO ALSO WANTS VALUE. SO I THINK WALMART IS VERY DEMOCRATIC IN TERMS OF WHERE IT MATT: A COSTLY STRATEGY THOUGH, THEY THAN THEY DO IN THEIR STORES. YOU CAN GET ONLINE. KEITH MORE INVENTORY AT THEIR MORE INVENTORY AT THEIR PHYSICAL 50% OF THEIR MERCHANDISE WAS JUST LIKE TARGET. YOUR FAVOR. HERE IS TO OFFER ALL SORTS OF IF THE CUSTOMER WANTS TO DRIVE IT DO THAT.

SO AT REVENTURE, YOU BRING CAN YOU GIVE US AN IDEA WHAT WHAT ARE THE HOT ZIP CODES AND NICHOLAS: THE HOTTEST HOUSING MARKETS AND MIDWEST, IN A LOT OF PLACES THERE SEEMS TO BE A KIND OF LIKE NEW YORK AND ILLINOIS AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE HOTTEST MOST DAYS ON THE MARKET AND THE THERE ARE SOME PARTS OF THE BAY AREA THAT ARE STARTING BOOM. VONNIE: WHAT TRACKS MORE, CHANGE IN FED WHO RUNS THE COUNTRY AND WHO COUNTRY? ELECTION, FOR EXAMPLE? NICHOLAS: THAT IS SOMETHING WE ARE IF YOU GO BACK TO 2016, THERE DEMAND IN THE MONTHS AND WEEKS SO WE ARE WATCHING THE DATA ON TO SEE IF A SIMILAR TREND PLAYS SO FAR, WE HAVE NOT SEEN IT, SOME BUYERS COME OFF THE THINKING THE ECONOMY WILL BE HOWEVER, GIVEN THE RECORD WORST ANTICIPATE A REBOUND TO BE THAT I WONDER WHAT POLICY ON A GOOSE THE HOUSING MARKET I CAN THINK OF A FEW ISSUES. WAS CAMPAIGNING PROMISED HE WAS STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTIONS 2017 TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT. THE HOUSING MARKET IN NEW YORK, AM NOT SURE HOW MUCH IT WOULD PETE. OF FEDERAL POLICY THAT COULD MARKET? NICHOLAS: POLICY WOULD BRING SOME BUYERS I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF TEXAS HAS VERY HIGH PROPERTY RIGHT, THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT OF INFLUENCING MARKET SENTIMENT. POLICY, CERTAINLY TRYING TO HELPFUL. AS I SAID BEFORE, MORE THAT IS SOMETHING, SUPPLY, THAT WE TALKED ABOUT POTENTIALLY PRIVATE DEVELOPERS AND THAT IS A CONTROVERSIAL POLICY WE COULD SEE HOUSING SUPPLY AND UTAH. MATT: LITTLE BIT MORE CERTAINTY AFTER PURCHASES. UNCERTAINTY BEFORE THE ELECTION CORPORATE LEADERS. TRIGGER UNTIL THEY SAW WHO WAS DO YOU THINK HOMEBUILDERS WILL TO MOVE ON PROJECTS? NICHOLAS: CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE BUILDERS. AGGRESSIVE ON THE INCENTIVES THE MORTGAGE RATE BUYDOWNS A ARE GETTING AGGRESSIVE. TO BUILD MORE IN 2025. TRANSCRIPTS. RAMP UP PRODUCTION. BUYERS FIRST. I THINK MAYBE THE MONTH OR TWO AFTER THE ELECTION HAVE TO SEE THE BUYERS WALK MORTGAGES BEFORE THEY RAMP UP THEY DO SEEM KEEN AND MORE, AND I THINK THEY MIGHT HOMES IN 2025 IF THEY DO THAT. LOOKING FORWARD TO ANOTHER THAT IS NICHOLAS GERLI, CEO AND WANTED TO POINT TO A SURVEY TO TERMS WITH RENTING MORE NOW GET INTO THE HOUSING MARKET. THAT IS OF COURSE CONTRARY TO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IT. OF THAT. LIKE MORTGAGE INTEREST HOMEOWNERSHIP. PROBLEM THAT THE TRUMP HE WAS CAMPAIGNING, PRESIDENT HE WAS THINKING ABOUT. POLICY IN THIS SENSE AS YOU GOT SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO ABOUT IT. VONNIE: EXACTLY. THE $25,000 FIRST-TIME BUYER AT ONE POINT BUT NOT MUCH WAS WHAT HAPPENS. THAT IS THE ONLY TIME I OWN. AT THE END OF THE DAY BECAUSE ASSETS INCLUDING THE S&amp;P 500, MOSTLY THANKS TO THE NVIDIA YOU THINK THE MOVE IS DONE NOW? I THINK IT IS A HUGE MOVE FOR THE DAY BEFORE EARNINGS BECAUSE WITH TOMORROW. SELL THE NEWS PUSHES US UP BUT TOMORROW AS WELL. INVESTORS THINK NVIDIA ONCE COVER OFF THE BALL IN TERMS OF EXPECTATIONS AND RAISING A LONG-TERM TRACK OF THEIR PE HAVE EARNINGS IT CUTS DOWN ROCKET TO THE END OF THE WHAT CAN BE SAID THIS TIME?

MATT: WILL PLAY? NAMED USTR, AND THE CAMPAIGN I HAVE ALSO HEARD FROM INTERESTED HIMSELF IN TREASURY, FIVE OR SIX PEOPLE THAT THE FOR TREASURY. KIM: OTHER THAN HE IS A TALENTED HE IS DEVOTED TO POLICYMAKING. BACKGROUND IN THE SPACE. BUT HE IS QUITE DEVOTED TO THE TREASURY TOO HAS A VERY LARGE ONE OF THE SECRETARIES HAVE A CERTAINLY THE UNITED STATES THE PLUMS IN ANY PRESIDENT'S I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF HE IF HE IS NOT, IT WOULD APPEAR IN TRADE POLICY AND WHO DO YOU THINK AT THE END TREASURY?
