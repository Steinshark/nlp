So yesterday he did this. [helicopter whirring] - Can you show us? - That's the agreement that So--no, because do the announcement For Mexico, they want but here's the agreement. - Okay, okay. There are two possibilities And neither of them are good. Either the president and claimed it's which it could be, or it's a real agreement and the president with secret documents Right, the same guy about Hillary's server meanwhile he could get hacked Or even worse, 'Cause he'd just be like, &quot;the secret document &quot;that--ah!

It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form. One way or the other, Mexico's That's right. It may be through but one way or the other, The wall will pay for itself We're working that will generate revenue that will pay for the wall. We have a trade deficit of $58 billion.
