[WHISTLE BLOWS] BUT NOW THE REAL FEBRUARY 2016, 15 MONTHS AND MIAMI'S NEWEST LANDMARK CONSTRUCTION HAS REACHED THE SEVENTH FLOOR, INSIDE-OUT SUPPORT COLUMNS CERRI: THIS IS THE FIRST THAT TAKES OFF THIS IS WHERE IT'S STARTING. YOUR CURVES START NARRATOR: SO FAR, BY POURING CONCRETE BUT EVEN THE BEST FINISH THAT'S A PROBLEM IS DEFINED BY ITS SILKY CURVES, SO FROM THE 15th FLOOR, THE EXOSKELETON WILL BE FORMED USING A GROUNDBREAKING KNOWN AS GLASS FIBER IT'S NORMALLY USED BUT HERE, PREMADE PANELS AS PERMANENT FORMWORK TO DELIVER MAN: WE EXPLORED EVERYTHING FROM POURED CONCRETE TO FAUX TO STEEL AND SEEING IF WE COULD THIS REALLY WAS THE ONLY WAY NARRATOR: THE EXOSKELETON BY CLAMPING GFRC PANELS OF REINFORCED STEEL.

HANLON: IT'S VERY DIFFICULT INTO THE BACK OF THE--TO THE SO WITHOUT THIS SYSTEM, YEAH. THE SYSTEM WE HAVE A BESPOKE SOLUTION, WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO ENSURE THAT THOSE CRADLES IN A SAFE AND SECURE MANNER. NARRATOR: THE LATEST SHIPMENT IN 6 WEEKS' TIME, AND READY FOR INSTALLATION. [KNOCK KNOCK] MARCH 2016.

THE BUILD IS ENTERING AND SHELL SUPERINTENDENT MUST NOW MASTER BISSON: WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT TRYING TO IMPLEMENT A PLAN, SHAPE--EVERY COLUMN CHANGES [WHISTLE BLOWS] IT'S A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING. NARRATOR: EACH PANEL EMBEDDED IN THE FLOOR SLAB THREADED THROUGH BUT IMMEDIATELY, THE PANELS AREN'T ATTACHING AND EVERY MODIFICATION FROM THE ENGINEERS IN DUBAI TO ENSURE THEY'RE THE TECHNOLOGY SUPPOSED IS HAVING A NEGATIVE EFFECT PATRIARCA: THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY USE THE CONVENTIONAL THAT WE'RE USED TO BUILDING SO THIS SYSTEM NARRATOR: ONE OF THE STEEL RODS TO THE BUILDING WASN'T LINING UP TO AVOID WAITING IT'S TAKEN TWO DAYS TO MAKE THE NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE LATEST COLUMN. BEFORE IT CAN BE FILLED THE TEAM MUST CLAMP OR THE PRESSURE WILL BLOW THE COLUMN APART. [HAMMERING] AS THE HOPPER CONTAINING IS CRANED INTO POSITION, IT'S ESSENTIAL PATRIARCA: TYPICAL CONSTRUCTION, 5,000-PSI CONCRETE. THIS IS WELL OVER DOUBLE TOUGHEST CONCRETE WATCH OUT! HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY! NARRATOR: BUT AS THE CONCRETE TONY'S WORST NIGHTMARE THE SUPER-STRENGTH MIXTURE AT THE BOTTOM.

HERE, THERE'S NO MARGIN [MEN SHOUT] BISSON: AS YOU CAN SEE THIS COLUMN HERE AND THIS SOUTHWEST CORNER 8 FLOORS ABOVE THIS LOCATION. IF WE GET THEM OFF IT WON'T LINE UP PROPERLY IN THE CORNER. NARRATOR: THE STEELWORKERS' THE HEAVY-DUTY COLUMNS GOT TO GO DOWN ON THAT CORNER NARRATOR: IT'S NOW A CASE AFTER TWO HOURS KEITH IS SATISFIED AND THE REINFORCING STEEL IT CAN NOW BE WRAPPED IN 8 FLOORS' TIME INTO THE MAIN STRUCTURE, IF THE COLUMNS ALIGN OR IF THEY'VE MADE TO ACHIEVE THE 2018 IN JUST 24 MONTHS, NOW HAS A COMBINED WORKFORCE CERRI: RIGHT NOW, WE CAN GO 11 OUT OF 12, LET'S MOVE IT! ALL RIGHT. NARRATOR: EVERY PERSON ON SITE AND NO ONE HAS WORKED MAN: OH, I LOVE IT, MAN, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT IS. THAT LITTLE THING LIKE THIS THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY THEY'RE LIKE, &quot;WOW.

MORABITO: IT'S A PAIN, I THOUGHT AS I GOT OLDER, BUT, NAH, I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT. NARRATOR: THE REASON TO BE A PAIN IS THAT THANKS TO ITS CURVACEOUS DESIGN, EVERY WALL, DOORWAY, WASTE PIPE, IS IN A DIFFERENT POSITION MORABITO: IT'S EASY BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY EACH DAY, YOU GET THROWN SOMETHING'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT, ALL RIGHT. NARRATOR: THE CHEAPEST APARTMENT COSTS $5.8 MILLION. YOU GUYS-- OH, THEY DIDN'T BUILD NARRATOR: IN THIS PRICE RANGE, AND TO ENSURE THEY GET IT, A FORENSIC, FLOOR-BY-FLOOR THIS ALIGNMENT BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE AND YOU'LL SEE ANYTHING NARRATOR: ON THE 17th FLOOR, JUST HOURS BEFORE THE CEILING MARK'S EXPERT EYE THE LIGHTS AND SPRINKLERS HAVE MORABITO: IF THAT'S CENTER LINE, NARRATOR: IT'S A SMALL DETAIL, AND 8,000 CEILING LIGHTS JUST A SMALL TAP THIS WAY, NARRATOR: LITTLE DETAILS IF WE'D HAVE DRYWALLED, NARRATOR: MARK HAS NARROWLY LET'S KEEP MOVING EVERYBODY NARRATOR: BUT EVERY DELAY MORABITO: YOU'VE GOT 10 PEOPLE ALL THEM PEOPLE COME TO A HALT.

NARRATOR: CHIEF INSTALLER TO INSTALL ALL 80 BALCONIES, BUT RIGHT NOW, COMING UP. NARRATOR: THE PREMADE TO SLOT ONTO STEEL PINS SET FIRM UNFORTUNATELY, THE PINS YOU GOT A HOLE HERE, WILSON: IT'S MADE BUT YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AND YOU HAVE 4 HOLES THAT WHEN YOU'RE BRINGING THEY SHOULD SLIDE RIGHT DOWN, WE'RE OFF, AND WE NEED WHERE WE'RE NOT WE'RE GONNA COME DOWN WILSON: TIME IS OF ESSENCE HERE. WE'RE TRYING TO GET PER INSTALLATION TEAMS. EVERY SINGLE THING THAT NARRATOR: AFTER TWO FURTHER ANDREW ABORTS THE INSTALLATION. TO FIT THE BALCONY HE'LL NEED TO MODIFY THE PANEL, WITHOUT FIRST GAINING PERMISSION TO ENSURE IT REMAINS AND THEY ARE CONVINCED SHOULD FIT PRECISELY YEAH. OK. NO PROBLEM. I'VE KIND OF SHUT THIS DOWN. WE ARE GONNA GO BACK AND GET WITH OUR ENGINEERS AND COME UP WITH A SOLUTION. NARRATOR: THE NEXT MORNING, ANDREW KNOWS WHY GOT THAT ONE NARRATOR: THE PROBLEM OF THE CUSTOM-MADE PANEL. IT'S THE RESULT OF HUMAN ERROR. STOP. WILSON: THE ISSUES WE'VE BEEN UP ABOVE HAVE BEEN WHEN THEY POURED THE CONCRETE, NOT IN THEIR RIGHT LOCATION SO THE BOLTS AREN'T COMING UP. NARRATOR: THE ENGINEERS IN DUBAI TO INSTALL TWO NEW PINS COMING UP. NARRATOR: WITH THE PINS THE BALCONY FLOOR NOW SLOTS IT'S A SIMPLE FIX, HAS TAKEN A WEEK TO INSTALL. WORRYINGLY FOR ANDREW, WILSON: WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL SO WE'RE OBVIOUSLY WAY BEHIND TO GET IT ACCOMPLISHED. THE FIRST PIECE HAS NOT NARRATOR: UP ON THE 32nd FLOOR KEITH BISSON IS PREPARING OF THE BUILD YET. COME ON, WADE. NARRATOR: THIS IS WHERE OF THE EXOSKELETON, REJOIN IN THE CORNERS. SO FAR, THE ALIGNMENT KEITH'S JOB IS TO NOW WITH 5 CUSTOM-MADE PANELS. BISSON: WHEN IT WE'RE THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE. WHEN IT GETS HERE, YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT FIT. NARRATOR: AS THE LAST PANEL CONSTRUCTION SUPERINTENDENT PATRIARCA: I'VE GOT A GAP WHEREAS THIS SHOULD BE FLUSH, IT'S NOT MAKING A LOT THIS PANEL'S THAT JOINT IS GOOD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S TO BE PUSHING OUT NARRATOR: FURTHER INVESTIGATION FOR THE MISALIGNMENT IS DUE DOWN ON THE 24th FLOOR, IS 1/8th INCH OUT, AND THAT TINY MISTAKE MAKING THE COLUMN NOW PATRIARCH: THE END OF THE DAY, SOMEHOW, WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE 1 INCH IN THIS DIRECTION. THIS IS A BAD ONE. IT PREVENTS US NARRATOR: TO STOP CONSTRUCTION KEITH AND TONY BUT AS THE GFRC EXPERT, KEITH KNOWS HIS OPTIONS I CAN'T JUST HACK IT UP IT'S VERY TECHNICAL, YOU CAN'T ABUSE THE PANEL. NARRATOR: TO MAKE MORE ROOM TONY'S SUGGESTION BETWEEN EACH SECTION THIS WAY, THE FIFTH PANEL PATRIARCA: BY SACRIFICING IN EACH OF THE JOINTS, WE THINK TO MOVE THE PANELS NARRATOR: IT SOUNDS BUT IT MEANS LIFTING UP KEITH THINKS TO RISK BEING FULLY REMOVED. BISSON: WE KNOW HOW FRAGILE WE RISK THE POTENTIAL IF WE PICK THEM UP NARRATOR: HE DECIDES TO FORCE BISSON: WE THINK NARRATOR: TONY WATCHES ON PREPARES TO PUSH IN PATRIARCA: YOU PUSH CONCRETE IT USUALLY DOESN'T YOU COULD BUST THAT PANEL. I'M GONNA PUMP IT. I WANT TO PUSH IT AND I'M TRYING [CRACK] NARRATOR: JUST AS TONY FEARED, THE FORCE HAS CRACKED FORTUNATELY, THE DAMAGE BUT KEITH'S PLAN IS ABORTED. IF THEY'RE TO GET BACK ON TRACK, BUT TO REVERT BACK TO TONY'S THE PANELS WILL NOW BE LIFTED PATRIARCA: WE'VE BEEN MESSING THIS COLUMN SPECIFICALLY, WE JUST GOT TO SUCK IT UP, BISSON: TODAY WAS A CLOSE CALL. THE PANEL WAS DAMAGED, AS YOU GO UP THE BUILDING, IT'S A NEW PIECE. IT CHANGES ON YOU, SO EVERYTHING ON THE FLOOR BELOW, AND USE A LITTLE BIT OF IT, IT'S ANOTHER CHALLENGE BECAUSE EVERY PANEL'S DIFFERENT NARRATOR: AFTER 3 MORE HOURS THE 5 PANELS ALL RIGHT, SO AFTER OUR FINAL WE'VE GOT DOWN TO PROBABLY WHICH IS BETTER HOPEFULLY, WE LEARNED AND NEXT COUPLE COLUMNS, NARRATOR: APRIL 2017, FIRST BROKE GROUND THE 62-STORY SKYSCRAPER TO BUILD HAS PASSED THE HALFWAY DESPITE THE DIFFICULTIES THE THE TEAM IS STILL KEY TO KEEPING THE BUILD ATTACHED TO THE OUTSIDE THEY'RE CALLED BUCK HOISTS, THEY'RE A LIFELINE CERRI: I MEAN, THIS IS IF YOU CAN'T GET AND YOU CAN'T GET THEM AND YOU CAN'T AND YOU AND YOU CAN'T GET THE PEOPLE YOU JUST CRIPPLED BUENOS DIAS. NARRATOR: DWIGHT PATERSON, TODAY WE'RE ON THE NARRATOR: IS IN CHARGE THE BUILDING'S TWO ALL-IMPORTANT WE'RE GONNA PATERSON: WITH NO ELEVATOR, THE MEN CAN'T GET IF THEY GET, THEY GOT SO THEY'RE TIRED SO BY DOING THIS, WE FACILITATE AND THE MOVEMENT WITHOUT THIS, NARRATOR: BUT ONCE AGAIN, OF THE SKYSCRAPER IS CREATING PATERSON: THIS BUILDING'S BECAUSE OF THE EXOSKELETON.

I GOT YOU, NARRATOR: BUT TWO FLOORS BELOW, JOE CERRI HAS SPOTTED THE TOP OF THE BUCK-HOIST TOWER DANGEROUSLY AWAY GOING ANY HIGHER COULD CAUSE TO BE RIPPED FROM THE BUILDING, SENDING THE ELEVATOR CAR JOE SHUTS THE BUCK HOIST IT'S NOT GOOD NARRATOR: IT'S NOW CRITICAL THE BUCK HOIST THAT MEANS DISMANTLING AND REBUILDING IT THROUGH CERRI: NARRATOR: TO PREVENT JOE WANTS IT BACK UP AND RUNNING PATERSON: WE'RE UNDER WHERE USUALLY IT WILL WE GOT TO GET IT DONE SO WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. DIME QUANDO YO. PATERSON: JOE'S VERY DEMANDING. IT'S ANOTHER LITTLE SPEED BUMP BUT WE'RE GONNA KEEP GOING. NARRATOR: TO SHOWCASE AND HELP BOOST SALES, THE DEVELOPERS HAVE ANNOUNCED OF A NO-EXPENSE-SPARED SHOW IT HAS TO BE READY IN JUST TWO MONTHS' TIME, BUT AT THE MOMENT, THESE GUYS WANT IT. WE WANT THEM TO GET IT THE REST OF THIS PLACE SO THEY LET'S GO BACK TO WORK. NARRATOR: TODAY, SCORPION TOWER WILL INSPECT PROGRESS OF AND HE'S A TOUGH MAN TO PLEASE. RIGHT. VISUALLY, I HATE I'D RATHER NOT NARRATOR: THE SIZE AND POSITION MAY SEEM TRIVIAL, BUT IN HERE, VENGER: THE FULL-FLOOR UNITS WE GOT TO GET IT AS PERFECT SO WHEN A UNIT OWNER THEY DO NOT HAVE A HEART ATTACK OR GRILL ON THE SIDE. NARRATOR: THIS ONE APARTMENT FOR THE ENTIRE BUILDING. THE STANDARD OF ITS FINISH MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR SALES.
