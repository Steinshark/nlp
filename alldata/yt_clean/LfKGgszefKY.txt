(water splashing) (seagull squawking ) Today, we're board of CeFeA, she's 111 foot SOLARIS Super a whole bunch of very prestigious awards. (upbeat music) Let's check out this fully carbon-fiber, sailing superyacht, come onboard. You guys, we just were with an actual designer, and it is mind blowing, we cannot wait to share it all with you. There's so many cool that I'm not gonna be opening, nearly as many storage because I think we're gonna talking about everything - [Rico] I mean how about - It's unbelievable, so the owner wanted to create One would be more of his private space, and another one would which will be more for So this space is actually to an owner's suite, and is 40 square meters. - Get ready for this. - Yes, with an extension of right here on this back deck. So we've got 80 square meters of pretty much an owner's suite space. - [Rico] So a couple steps up, of course, there's a to keep you out of the weather, So all the stanchions and are... - Let him guess - [Rico] Titanium. This yacht is fully carbon fiber, so weight is extremely important. So, it's very light weight, and what I love about it the most, it is zero maintenance. - It doesn't rust, nothing happens, so it's money well Can we just say to begin with that the beam on this What is it, eight meters in feet? - [Rico] Almost 30 feet. - Unbelievable, the beam And then, these, you guys - [Rico] Very large Harken winches with carbon fiber tops, pretty amazing. - Blown away. So right here, we have a dual helm set up, and Rico can run you - [Rico] It's a little bit sunken, so this boat has a very, very everything is kept extremely We still have our seats here on the side. Oh, wow, that's a really cool wheel. Seriously, oh, my God, that - [Victoria] Geeking - [Rico] Anyway. So we or all our sailing switches we need, for the main, the main sheet, code zero, forestay and the keel up and down, because it has actually retractable keel, and the thrusters as well, and then our electronics package, which is B &amp; G on this vessel. That's the main sheet sheet. So the main sheet is - The boom length is 14 meters. - [Rico] Which is pretty - I hope it's all registering cause... - [Rico] So, the whole The shrouds are carbon fiber, the mast is carbon fiber, from the waterline. This is a performance boat, this is not, you know, your this is a performance boat, - Not just interior, I would say super yacht exterior, as well. - [Rico] Exterior and interior, yeah! - Yeah, with superyacht it just won an award for exterior design, so you're never sacrificing the luxury. A lot of times you get on a and it just feels like it's bare bones. Yes! And it's nowhere to sit - [Rico] Here, you don't - Check out the size of this - [Rico] Which, again, that it's actually tucked away. It's not an eyesore when you know. Like here right now, it's warm, you don't need to be out of the wind, you don't need to be out of the elements. If you just go for a nice-day cruise or something like this. Right, bringing up the dodger, unless you wanna be in the shade, and then you also have tucked away here all the hardware for the Bimini. - Yeah. Which you would definitely use if you want to stay out of the sun. - [Rico] And, and then it for your main cockpit. - Let's keep going forward. What stands out immediately is - [Rico] Nowhere - It's a completely flush deck. - So the foresail on this boat right now is As we can see here with the below deck and run all the way aft. But there's no safety hazard whatsoever. - The sail surface on this 300 square meters on the main sheet and 300, on the jib. Just got like a bucket list thing. You know how I added to on something like this. - [Rico] Go-go out, - This is now on my bucket list of yachti things to do in my life. - [Rico] Let's keep going forward. - Okay. Yes, it's a long walk forward. - [Rico] So, - It is a runway. - [Rico] All the furlers are hydraulic. Of course, you have, you know, stay sail or storm sail set up here, which Then we do have our jib and of course you still have an for a code zero or a spinnaker. - So there is like a, you area here for your and extra sail. Drum roll it. ( imitates drum roll) ( Victoria gasps) Just, you know, it's little. - [Rico] That is a proper on a sailing yacht. It is incredible. - [Victoria] You're not - [Rico] Nope. - [Victoria] No need. - [Rico] Really cool. Now you actually understand such a massive volume. - The volume is insane, It's incredible. ( upbeat music plays) Unbelievable. - [Rico] On the main sail, we have a pole of nine tons on the - And this vessel is 133 gross tons. - [Rico] Yes. - So it just gives you an if you guys know how the gross tonnage is calculated based on enclosed space on cargo enclosed space. That is a lot of volume. - [Rico] It is. - For sailing yacht. ( upbeat music continues) - The teak, the caulking. It's just pristine. It truly is pristine. You know, you on board of a really amazing superyacht. - [Rico] Shall we check out the interior? - Well, no, we gotta check We weren't here yet. - [Rico] That's right. - So we have a high, low table converted into another massive lounge. - [Rico] Yeah. - Napping spot. And then we have this table here that also could become smaller, you easily get in and out if you don't need such a big table. - [Rico] Integrated light for the cockpit and the carbon mast. - Of course. And we're gonna check out the interior. - [Rico] We forgot to mention that when we're walking - [Victoria] Oh yes. - [Rico] Forward at the with all the information whatever you wanna put on there. True wind speed, speed overground, course overground, depth. I mean, name it, whatever And it's massive numbers. So you can see it perfectly - It's such a cool feature. It's amazing. - [Rico] Really cool. Yeah. - All right. Let's go and - [Rico] Sounds good. (chill music plays) - Welcome to... - [Rico] The salon... - the salon of this beautiful superyacht. So the whole thought with the designer, was, to of the sailing vessel. You kind of come down sort of looks boring interior. You can tell immediately The whole point was to break some power, superyacht features into it. I agree! Still keeping it timeless, that in 10 years this boat is current. You know, it doesn't feel outdated. - [Rico] For Sure, for sure. I mean, I'll look at all the We have the leather here. Ah, the wood is beautiful. - [Victoria] It is. - [Rico] Just touching the walls. - There's something about and you wanna touch. And this boat is just full of them. Like these chairs. I just, I see them and I just wanna touch 'em This, for example, here, you know, the way they rounded this up and the way feels, it's like velvet - [Rico] All the surfaces soft feel to them. - It's hard to describe it, That feeling of just that surface is And you think you grab - [Rico] So, so let's So it's a salon slash dining area. - Yes.
