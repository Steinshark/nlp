[Music playing, no additional audio] [Devin] Hi, and welcome to Trex Academy, where you can learn everything you need I'm Devin, and I'm here with Lindsay, all of our concrete footings, so here today, they would be hard enough [Lindsay] Um-hum. [Devin] and also install our beams. [Lindsay] Yeah, so what do we do to get started? [Devin] Alright. So the first thing we'll be doing is find the location of our So I've actually got some example [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] So first of all, it's important contact from our deck to the house. [Lindsay] Um-hum And when we have that, we'll also have [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] So, you can see the bottom of these are we're gonna know the location of our beams because [Lindsay] Got it. That makes sense. [Devin] Okay. Once we have that determined, [Lindsay] Great. [Devin] Alright, so let's go Okay. We're gonna find the Alright. Alright. So, before we can find we actually need to find the exact Okay. Okay, so let's start by talking a little [Lindsay] Sure. [Devin] I think what you'll mostly see, just below the threshold of your door. Of [Lindsay] Um-hum. [Devin] but you can also see is called a step down, which is going to [Lindsay] Okay, so why are we, [Devin] Right. So, the most that is because that was the original [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] So we know that of our ledger board once it [Lindsay] That makes sense. would they have chosen to do that step down? [Devin] To step down instead of the step out? [Lindsay] Um-hum. [Devin] The main reason this [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] So instead of building up against the door and when you open it all that snow comes in, [Lindsay] Oh, that's a smart idea, I like that. [Devin] Yep. Yep. [Devin] So we're gonna stick with that design. Let's go ahead and measure Make a mark right there for me if you would. [Lindsay] I think I can do that. There you go. [Devin] This is the top of our deck. So, [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] So you need to get whatever in our case we're using Trex Enhance. We're going to use this material as a guide as out obviously whatever material we're using have you make a mark for me. [Lindsay] No problem. There you go. [Devin] Alright, perfect. So, we are going to rest on top of the frame, which is [Lindsay] Yep. [Devin] So that's what the height of that is. [Lindsay] Okay. So, let's just keep doing the same thing, of our joist and our ledger board are going to Okay, level that. Okay, go ahead [Lindsay] There you go. [Devin] Now we're getting to which is our our beam height [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] So now we're bringing in a of our beams are going to be made out So if we bring this up, We're going to be leveling it. Right there. But instead of making a mark underneath we've [Lindsay] Yeah, I saw that, [Devin] Yeah, I'll show you exactly what [Lindsay] You're going to keep me in suspense. [Devin] That's right. [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] So for now, let's [Drill whirring, no additional audio] [Devin] And now we have the location of the [Lindsay] Okay, great. So just So we have our deck boards here, with that line. We have our ledger and our joists; [Devin] Um-hum. [Devin] Yeah, that's it. [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] All right, we're ready [Lindsay] Yeah, we are. [Devin] We're using six by sixes for this project. [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] But, before we actually start show you how to make a simple stand [Lindsay] Alright. [Devin] just in case you're doing a project or if you just want to make [Lindsay] Cool. [Devin] So all you need to which in our case we're using 2x4's and then you [Lindsay] Great. Yeah, it looks like this is [Devin] Yeah exactly. And even if to just rip it down to size and [Lindsay] Cool. [Devin] All right we'll go ahead and mark [Music playing and drill whirring.] [Devin] All right, Lindsay, we've got our stand built. [Lindsay] Yeah. [Devin] So if you don't mind, you'll [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] Kind of try to line [Lindsay] Sure. [Devin] Also, go ahead and set these tools [Lindsay] Sounds good. [Devin] I'm gonna go ahead [Feet shuffling on dirt, tapping [Devin] All right, so for our straight You could use any size lumber; just [Rooster crowing] [Devin] And Lindsay, you finally get to see what that whole secret about [Lindsay] Ahh, I love it; it's [Devin] Exactly. Well especially [Lindsay] Yeah. [Devin] I think that looks good. [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] All right, so we're gonna level as possible just with our eyes. [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] I think it looks pretty good. Good [Lindsay] Um-hum. [Devin] All right, very nice. Hand me that [Shuffling shoes across [Devin] Okay. So from here we're gonna be [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] Throw this right on top, and now [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] Okay, so I'm gonna have you do this gonna use your hand, hand, essentially as a clamp [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] as you're working it. Okay, [Lindsay] Oh, yeah. [Devin] And as you get pretty close, like you are and it'll get that movement a little more precise. [Lindsay] I gotcha. [Lindsay] There we go. [Devin] Yeah, that's perfect. Okay, [Lindsay] Great. [Lindsay] Thanks. [Devin] Alright, so now let's think back So, we have the bottom of our beam, [Lindsay] Um-hum. [Devin] and this line is coming all So we will be marking the bottom but it's always important to remember not the top of our post, but [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] So no matter what option you that's always going to be [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] And we'll go over a few of those [Lindsay] Alright. [Devin] So let's go ahead [Lindsay] Sure. [Rubber band snapping against wood post] [Devin] Alright, you're just going to be basically [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] It should be pretty. [Lindsay] Oh, so close. [Devin] Yeah. [Lindsay] Yep, there we are. [Devin] Alright, perfect. Make a line here. Alright, so we'll do the same that's the bottom of our beam, so that [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] Okay? [Lindsay] Yep. [Devin] Okay, so now let's take a look at the different options that we have for So, we've actually made some different mock-ups, showing both approved and non-approved I think it'd be a good idea if we and see if you think they're [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] Sound okay? [Lindsay] Yeah. [Devin] Alright. So, I'll make it you some criteria to determine [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] Okay, so the most important one has [Lindsay] Makes sense. [Devin] First thing we're looking you to know everything about code in this area, but here are the two main things that are One is going to be: Does the beam rest on and is [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] First thing you're looking for. [Lindsay] Alright. Can it support a sudden shift? So that you have. A large gust of wind, [Lindsay] Um-hum. It needs to be able to deal with those forces. [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] Okay? [Lindsay] Got it. [Devin] Okay, so here we have a 4x4 post and That's all connected by our half [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] Okay, so what do you think of that? [Lindsay] Well, first off it checks the first, [Devin] Yeah, right. [Lindsay] Which is, the beams [Devin] Okay. [Lindsay] But, the next box of that it looks like it is barely supported in that way. [Devin] Yeah, you're exactly right. [Lindsay] Like this lateral [Devin] I'm pretty sure if we put enough So, you're right. It checks the but we're missing the lateral That's just not going to cut it. There's [Lindsay] Yeah. [Buzzer. No additional audio.] [Devin] Not approved. Nope, All right, so, we still have the same materials. Again, with our double 2x10 beam. [Lindsay] Um-hum. [Lindsay] Well, this one still so that's good, and it looks like [Devin] Right. [Lindsay] So, these actually [Devin] Yeah, our brackets that we have on there. [Lindsay] Yeah. [Devin] Our brackets and [Lindsay] Yep, uh, so I'd [Bell dinging, no additional audio.] [Devin] Yeah, exactly, it's All right. So, this time I'm gonna throw a new [Lindsay] Okay. (Laughing) [Devin] So we've got our 6x6. We still [Lindsay] All right. [Devin] And that's all joined together with [Lindsay] Um-hum. [Lindsay] So laterally looks good. [Devin] Absolutely. [Lindsay] But it is not supported. These [Devin] Yeah, right. [Lindsay] You're gonna have to give me [Devin] Good, yeah, you're so that's almost the opposite of the first [Buzzer, wood dragging on [Devin] Okay, so here's what it use those materials and it be code approved. [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] We still have our 6x6. Then we [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] Now we have our approved [Bell dinging, no additional audio] [Devin] Okay everything we need. Alright. So, let's move on to the next one. [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] And, uh, wow. Now we have a triple beam. [Lindsay] Um-hum. [Devin] On top of a 4x4. What do you think of that? [Lindsay] Well, the triple beam is [Devin] Yeah, you're absolutely right. [Lindsay] So these first two beams [Devin] Um-hum, that's great. [Lindsay] Yeah, but this third [Devin] Not at all not approved. [Buzzer, wood dragging across wood.] [Devin] Definitely not approved. So instead, what we should have seen, is a supported by a 4x4, because just like our beam isn't fully supported, so [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] So again, same situation, now we have and we have our approved fasteners. [Bell dinging, wood shuffling [Lindsay] Yep, that looks way more secure. [Devin] Brackets, yeah. Alright, so now we're moving and actually the option that [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] So what we've got to the same dimensions as our double 2x10 beam. [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] You can see that's all held together and now we have a really secure [Lindsay] Yeah. So obviously this is [Bell dinging] [Lindsay] Why did you choose [Devin] So, like over the other coat [Lindsay] Yep. [Devin] Okay. So really it comes down to So, we are going to have a drop beam. [Lindsay] Um-hum. [Devin] And we know that we're going So, this just checks all the boxes and it's really [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] Okay, so now that we know we can go ahead and start notching [Lindsay] Sounds good. [Devin] Alright, let's do it. [Lindsay] Hey Jason. [Jason] Hey Lindsay good to see you again. [Lindsay] Good to see you too. How's it going? [Jason] Oh, I'm doing great. [Lindsay] Good, good. Jason, [Devin] Jason. [Lindsay] Jason is a friend of mine who's He heard we were in the framing stage of with the understanding of course that we're [Devin] Perfect. Yeah, we have plenty of Have you done any projects like this in [Jason] Yeah, I've done a fair replaced some old wood floors, [Devin] Oh, that's great, that'll help. [Jason] Yeah, but never any deck framing. [Devin] Okay. [Jason] Ah, the decking and the but I really need to build my So I'm excited to learn from a pro. 13:20 [Lindsay] Yeah, definitely. Well, let me catch you up to [Music playing] After we cleaned up the area, we staked so we could then find the location of our 12 The building inspector came by And after that, we mixed and poured [Jason] Looks like you guys have been super busy. [Devin] Yeah, we really have we've gotten a so I'm going to put you to work right away. I'll grab this one and we'll [Shuffling boots on dirt and thud of wood posts] [Devin] Alright. So now we're marks that we need to notch out our posts. Obviously we already have the bottom I think it would be nice if we bring in we're going to be using, so we can on the remainder of our post that we cut out the bottom, the top, and also that [Jason] Got it. [Devin] Okay. So, there's a couple One is going to be to just get some We'll measure the height. Thats nine and our notch to the top. Nine and a use a speed square to transfer [Jason] Okay. [Devin] The other way to do it, since we would be to take our square, put it right keep this square. You don't want the So, we'll just put that material right up against going to rest, but also where the top of Okay, so just make a line right here, and now we're going to transfer that [Music playing, thud of wood-on-wood, pinging of speed square, pencil dragging [Devin] I cut my notch cut perimeter then with my reciprocating We're now down to three cuts with the circular This way is faster, safer, and there's no So don't get me wrong, the repetitive but this is the method I prefer. [Devin] All right Jason, very For this next step you're You're also going to need this be putting a wood preservative on any of [Jason] Okay. [Music playing, no additional audio.] [Devin] So now we're going to repeat the We'll be finding the mark for the top of our cutting all of our notches out and then treating [Lindsay] Cool. [Devin] So once all of our posts are them into the post holes, and finally, [Lindsay] That sounds good. [Jason] Yeah, let's get your hands dirty. [Devin] Let's get right to it. [Music playing, no additional audio.] [Devin] The steps for installing our beams, in be virtually the same for our middle and [Lindsay] All right. [Devin] So we're going to start that process which is also going to be the edge The next thing we'll do is plumb make sure that they're straight up and down. [Lindsay] Um-hum. [Devin] Okay. With that out of the we're going to be making them in Once we have them made though, we'll be securing them to our post [Lindsay] Alright. [Devin] Okay. After that, all we have and the beams for this section [Lindsay] Great. [Devin] Alright, so let's get right to it. We're going to start with this post [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] It's coming straight out from the corner. So, since that's the edge of our deck, we really need to make sure [Lindsay] Got it. [Jason] Right. [Devin] So typically what we've been connecting it to that stand [Lindsay] Right. Using that 3-4-5 method, right? [Devin] Right, exactly. [Jason] 3-4-5? [Devin] Yeah. [Lindsay] So, the 3-4-5 method is a way so it's a way to find that right angle. So all you do is measure 3' feet, and then you measure the diagonal from the edge of [Jason] Okay, that makes sense. [Devin] Yep, it gives us that 90-degree angle. [Jason] Sure. [Devin] So we are going to be using a version obviously we have a larger scale, but, I'm that's going to make it faster and easier to [Lindsay] I like it. [Jason] Sounds good to me. [Devin] Alright, let's go ahead and build that [Devin] So we've got that custom tool, [Lindsay] Yeah it is. [Jason] Yeah. [Devin] So let's start out corner. It doesn't have to be level [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] I think it looks good right there. So Jason, go ahead and [Jason] Will do. [Devin] I'll get this one here. Alright. Obviously this end is standing right on All right Jason, if you don't mind, have. We're gonna be using those [Jason] Got it. [Devin] Alright. [Lindsay] Oh, Devin, I just [Devin] On right here? [Lindsay] Yeah. [Devin] Okay right, I see your confusion. So you would think since we're tight up that we should be square right here. [Lindsay] Yeah. [Devin] Well, unfortunately it's pretty common got a fireplace chase, not exactly [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] So it's pretty common to that's why we didn't use a string square been square which means the rest of our deck [Lindsay] And that would not have been good. [Devin] Exactly. So instead, [Lindsay] Okay. [Lindsay] Alright. [Lindsay] Good. [Devin] So let's go ahead [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] Go ahead and use our post leveler. [Jason] That's going on here. [Devin] Hey, thanks for grabbing those Jason. [Jason] You got it. [Devin] Alright, and go ahead and set it down. [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] So it is important to note we've made according to our plan, 6' away from the Okay, so we're gonna go down here now. That'll Got that in position I'm going Alright. So with this in position it's going to give you guys the ability to So Lindsay, you'll just grab up on the [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] And then Jason, what I want you until both of your levels that bubble [Jason] I think I can do that. [Lindsay] Just say when. [Jason] Drop it down. [Lindsay] Got it. [Devin] Alright, very nice. [Jason] Looking good. [Devin] Alright. So we have it plumb, but obviously if we take our square off [Lindsay] Yeah. [Devin] So we're gonna use those braces [Jason] Ahh, so that's what these are for huh? [Devin] Exactly. [Jason] There you go. [Devin] So I'll get this first one, [Lindsay] Sounds good. [Devin] Okay. So what we'll do first. Go ahead [Drill whirring, no additional audio] Alright. Let's repeat that process. [Lindsay] Alright. [Devin] Give you a little space there. [Lindsay] There we go. Got it. [Drill whirring, no additional audio] [Devin] Alright, very nice job. [Jason] Everything looks great over here. [Devin] Okay, it's good to go. So now we can remove our giant square and So now let's just repeat the same process [Lindsay] Sounds good. [Jason] Easy enough. [Devin] You got that? [Lindsay] Yep. [Devin] Okay. So we've got our first post pretty easy because we knew we were going to be [Lindsay] Right. [Devin] So for our next post, what we'll to find the center mark for [Lindsay] Cool. [Devin] It's going to be [Jason] Okay. [Devin] Alright. So what we'll do from this point, Lindsay, have you grabbed the end of [Lindsay] Got it. [Devin] And we'll get a mark All right, got it. That's going [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] Okay, but it's also important the post that we're looking for, we're [Jason] Okay. [Devin] So I've made a mark and that's going to be the point that [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] Okay. Alright, so let's go ahead and pull our giant again my edge is coming to the line that I've Looks good. Secure that in place. [Drill whirring, no additional audio.] [Devin] Alright, now we're just [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] We already have our that 6' line away from the house, that's going [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] So you can line that up but also make with the edge of that square. [Lindsay] Got it. [Devin] Okay. Lindsay, you [Lindsay] Sure. [Devin] Alright. [Devin] Yeah, yeah, absolutely. [Lindsay] Make sure it's plumb, right? [Devin] Yeah, we will need that. [Lindsay] Alright, got that on. Can you guys keep holding that for Alright, I think we're good. You can let it down. [Devin] Alright, looks perfect. Let's we'll go through the same process we did before. [Lindsay] Sounds good. [Drill whirring, feet shuffling [Devin] Alright, so we're ready to start on that notch, And Lindsay, just make sure that [Lindsay] Alright, yep, we [Devin] Alright. So if this were a smaller deck, say maybe like 12 foot wide, it'd be really cut both your 2x10's at once, put You just walk it over. Wouldn't be a wide deck, which means we need a 22' wide beam. It would be pretty hard to [Lindsay] Yeah, it sounds pretty heavy. [Devin] It's not really practical. So what we're gonna do instead. We're [Jason] Okay. [Devin] So we've got our first 2x10 in [Lindsay] Yep. Okay, so Jason, all I need you to do is extend that middle line that we [Jason] Got it. [Devin] Because remember, this so that the next 2x10 that comes up Alright. Got that marked, perfect. [Lindsay] Alright. [Devin] we'll rest it right Okay, so we're just going to It is important though that we make sure that you're a little bit [Lindsay] Yep, we're good [Jason] Good on this side. [Saw buzzing, boots shuffling on dirt, no additional audio.] [Devin] Alright, let's go ahead and Make sure that it ends flush. [Lindsay] Alright, we are perfect. [Devin] So now we're gonna secure it in place Jason, I'm gonna have you go [Jason] Okay just want to make sure that we avoid any placement where our half inch [Jason] Yeah, will do. [Devin] Do the same thing down here. [Lindsay] Okay. [Drill whirring, boots shuffling And on the end. It's just going to hold everything [Lindsay] Good. [Devin] Alright. Now we're just going to do so let's go get that and get it cut down. [Drill whirring, no additional audio.] [Devin] Alright, very nice. Got our first row of our [Lindsay] Yep. [Devin] It's great. [Jason] Hey guys, it's been a lot of but I gotta get going. [Devin] Leaving us? [Jason] Yeah, I'm leaving. [Lindsay] Alright, well thanks for coming out. [Jason] Thank you. [Devin] Thanks for all the [Jason] Devin, very nice to meet you. [Devin] You're welcome on the site, anytime. Well, we have to get back to work. [Lindsay] Sounds good. [Devin] We'll get our 2x10, [Lindsay] Alright. [Devin] And set that on our notches and [Lindsay] Okay. We're getting close here. [Devin] If you need to, you can tap it with [Lindsay] I'm gonna do that. [Devin] And we're using the [Lindsay] We're perfectly flush. [Devin] Alright. So we're using the same method that we [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] But instead, we're actually [Lindsay] Why are we working [Devin] Well, you can see we've got [Lindsay] Yeah. [Devin] So instead of stacking two splices on one post, we're gonna be putting [Lindsay] Is that code? [Devin] Uh, no not everywhere, it's more of a best practice thing like if we could [Lindsay] Um-hum. [Devin] why not do it? [Lindsay] Makes sense. [Devin] Okay, so we're flush down there. [Lindsay] Yeah. [Devin] I can go ahead and make my mark over here. [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] Mark the top, and then let's go ahead and put it on top of our post. [Lindsay] Sounds good. [Devin] Instead of walking over to our sawhorses. [Lindsay] Alright. [Lumber thud onto lumber, no additional audio.] [Devin] Got it? [Lindsay] Yep. [Devin] There we go. And just to make we're gonna elevate it up a little bit. [Lindsay] Make sense. [Lindsay] Here, let me get that for you. [Lumber thud against lumber, [Devin] Okay, thank you. [Devin] Very nice. [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] Alright. As long as it [Lindsay] Yep. [Whining of saw, no additional audio.] [Devin] Alright. So our next step pattern that we're going to need [Lindsay] So since you just set pattern, I'm assuming that means we can't just [Devin] Oh, absolutely not. No, so that's going to be determined [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] And in this municipality, it needs and 2&quot; from the end. [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] So you also need to be 16&quot; apart from each [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] Alright. So with that in mind, pull out your square. You should notice [Lindsay] I see that right here. [Devin] You're gonna start all the way at the you can drag it all the way across, Alright, very nice. [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] Okay, so now we need to [Lindsay] Um-hum. [Devin] Obviously, to do that, just make a mark. [Lindsay] Make sense. [Devin] Two inches, there we go, just get our square back out, Alright. From here let's get our tape [Lindsay] Okay. [Lindsay] Sure. [Devin] We need to make a mark at every 16 inches. [Lindsay] Got it. [Boots shuffling, pencil marring [Lindsay] Okay, we are all set. [Devin] Alright, I'm gonna let go of this. [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] Okay, doing the same we're just going to continue and every point that that vertical line [Lindsay] Um-hum. [Devin] we're gonna have a fastener [Lindsay] Okay. [Metal clanging on wood, boots [Lindsay] Okay, Devin, so I [Devin] Okay, first time, huh. [Lindsay] Yeah, so why are we using [Devin] Right, the ones we were using [Lindsay] Yeah. [Devin] Alright. So at this point we actually need structural screws because we're creating a [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] That's going to be [Lindsay] Gotcha. So do we have options or do we [Devin] Yeah. No, no, we've Could be some different nails, you do need to check with local municipality [Lindsay] Gotcha. Okay, got it. [Devin] If you're curious what we're Simpson Strong-Tie SDWS screws, made [Lindsay] Got it; say that three times fast. [Devin] Yeah, I know. It's a bit you ever want to go and find these in the [Lindsay] Okay, good to know. [Devin] So I'm gonna get started on this end. What I want to do, since we already have it [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] and you go down and work on that [Lindsay] Sounds good. [Drills whirring, no additional audio.] [Devin] Alright. So we're ready to attach this [Lindsay] Sounds good. [Devin] Let's go ahead and set it on is perfectly flush with the other 2x10. [Lindsay] Oh, I need you to bring it [Devin] Okay. [Lindsay] Right there. Perfect. Yeah. [Devin] Alright, perfect. Let's [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] And then, so after we get this clamped, I'm gonna go ahead and sink the [Lindsay] Alright. [Devin] I'll just have you And then while you're doing that, I'm going to [Lindsay] Sounds good. [Drills whirring, boots shuffling [Devin] Whoa, good catch. I forgot [Lindsay] Well, lucky for you I'm here. [Devin] Yeah at least somebody's paying attention. [Lindsay] Yep. [Devin] Okay, very nice. Once you get that done, if you don't to coat the end of this 2x10 as well. [Lindsay] Right you are. Alright, just a little bit [Devin] Okay, thank you. Let's set it down. [Lindsay] I'll get the ends flush. [Devin] Alright. Perfect. I'll [Clamps squeaking, boots shuffling [Devin] Alright all good over there? [Lindsay] Yeah. [Devin] Let's go ahead and get this [Drills whirring, wood banging, boots [Lindsay] Okay, what's next? We need to bolt this to the post. [Devin] Almost there, the beam's done. Our next step would be to bolt this I just want you to kind of rub your hand over [Lindsay] Oh, yeah, there is a [Devin] Right. Exactly. [Lindsay] So do we need to fix that? [Devin] Yeah, we definitely do. So, as our joists pass over it, we just want to top of the beam and they're not just [Lindsay] Yeah, sounds important. [Devin] Sounds like a bit of a problem. [Lindsay] Yeah. Okay, so how do we fix it? [Devin] Alright. So in our case, we're [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] We're just going to make shallow passes all the way down to the point where [Lindsay] Makes sense. Now is that the only way [Devin] There are a couple different ways; this In my case I do this job pretty often if you're going to be doing this a [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] But, if you're only maybe it's in your budget to just [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] Works just as well. Okay? Alright. So if you don't mind, just kind of feel down and [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] That way I know [Lindsay] I'd say right about here it feels like. [Devin] Good there? [Lindsay] Yeah. [Devin] Alright, make a mark for me. Yeah. I'm gonna put my ears in. [Lindsay] Great. [Devin] Okay, here we go. [Planer buzzing and paint brush swishing [Lindsay] Okay, so this is nice and even now, [Devin] Yep. and now are we finally ready [Devin] We're ready that is the next step. [Lindsay] Great. [Devin] Alright. So you'll remember earlier [Lindsay] Um-hum. [Devin] We're gonna be using that line just [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] But, in some of our posts, part of our being met together. [Lindsay] Yeah. [Devin] So when we have that splice, we need to make sure that we're [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] So in that case, we'll the middle of the middle if that makes sense. [Lindsay] Yeah. [Lindsay] Alright, yeah, so if we have a splice [Devin] Right. [Devin] Exactly, two on one side two on the other. In this case no splice right in [Lindsay] Got it. [Devin] Alright. I'm gonna go ahead [Lindsay] Okay. [Devin] then follow it down the face, did for our structural screws, and two inches up from the bottom, we line on the face we know exactly where we [Lindsay] Great. [Music playing, no additional audio.] [Lindsay] Yeah. [Devin] We can't enough of this thing, can we? [Lindsay] I know. There we go. [Devin] Alright, make sure [Lindsay] Yeah, it looks flush to me. [Devin] Okay. It's also important to make [Drill whirring, boots shuffling [Devin] Alright. So originally, we to make sure we had all of our post in line, [Lindsay] Yeah. [Devin] But, since we know that and that it's straight, we're gonna [Lindsay] Okay. So this is now our [Devin] Exactly. [Lindsay] So this is essentially [Devin] It really is, yeah. [Lindsay] okay so we will establish our edge, [Devin] Which we've got right here. [Lindsay] Yep. Flush up our post, then assemble [Devin] Put it all together. [Lindsay] Yep. [Devin] Yep.
