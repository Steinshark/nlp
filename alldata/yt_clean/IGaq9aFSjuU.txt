(plane engine roars) The crew of British Midland Flight 092 is completing final takeoff preparations for a short flight to Captain Kevin Hunt flew First First Officer David for the return trip. - Thrust set. Here we go. - Yeah. - [Narrator] As Flight 092 clears the busy airspace around Heathrow, the controller permits the crew to climb to the cruising - Can I have the coffee too, please? - [Narrator] 13 minutes into the flight. - Do you smell that? - Is that smoke? - [Narrator] There's a problem with one of the 737's two engines. Captain Hunt takes control to work out what's wrong with the plane. - There's fire, Kevin. - Which one is it? - It's the right one. - [Narrator] The crew tries to stabilize the problem engine by - Okay, throw it back. - Throwing it back. (plane engine roaring) - Seems to be running all right now. - [Narrator] The crew seems to have solved the immediate crisis. - Problem still got the smoke. - [Narrator] But want to as fast as possible. - This is Midland 092. We've got an engine fire. We need to divert to East Midlands. - Understood. Cleared for descend to 10,000 feet. - [Narrator] Flight 092 is just 15 minutes from East Midlands Airport. It's closer than returning to Heathrow. - Landing lights. - On. - [Narrator] The pilots will with just one engine. - Flaps one, please. - [Narrator] To land safely at low speed. - Flaps one. - [Narrator] The pilots to increase lift. - Power, please. - [Narrator] And call for more power from their one remaining engine. (plane engine rattling) The pilots face a terrifying new danger. - Releasing another engine. - [Narrator] Incredibly the (plane engine rattles) Their playing could soon Flight 092 is less than a The pilots need to think fast. - Try relighting the other one. - [Narrator] They try to restart - It's not, I can't seem to. - [Narrator] It won't start. One engine is dead, - I have to stretch the guy. - [Narrator] Captain Hunt hoping to stay in the air long (plane engine rattles) But more and more alarms - Target. - [Narrator] The stall warning a deadly sign that they're (plane crashes) British Midland Flight O92 beside the M1 Highway, just half a mile from the airport. 87 of the 126 people on board are alive, but many are injured, who has a broken spine. Chris Pollard scrutinizes engine debris recovered from farmland near Kegworth. Every fragment is a potential clue about what happened to - Some bits were extremely small. It is actually attribute to that we got as much as we did. - [Narrator] One fragment stands out. - Gotcha. - [Narrator] It shows clear because of where it was found, Pollard believes it was almost to break on the 737. - If you assume that the fatigue failure was the first failure, that would have lost about of one of the blades. - [Narrator] The finding could explain how the engine failure began. Even one broken fan blade can disturb the flow of air through an a process similar to a car backfiring. - What is it, the engines? - The engine tries to find It rattles around. - We're all right, mom. - It would have been lots The passengers reported in a tumble dryer of rocks It would have really been quite violent. - [Narrator] No two fan blades Pollard hopes a metallurgical examination will tell him which engine - Although the blades were all nominally have exactly the same alloy, there were, if you started to look in the sort of parts-per-million there were slight differences - [Narrator] Pollard soon has an answer. - Blade 17 left engine. - [Narrator] The blade that broke first and caused the vibration Investigators now face Why did the pilot shut if the vibrations were in the left? - A crew, this experience they would shut down the wrong engine. - [Narrator] Pilots have that tell them about the including one that measures vibration. There's another possibility, the vibration may have been so severe that it became impossible to read the shuttering gauges. - [Pollard] Right, here are gauges. - [Narrator] The layout may provide a partial explanation. - Right engine. Right. See, I can see how you messed this up. - [Narrator] The gauges sit on the right side of the pump. Under stress, the first officer may have thought they - The problem is definitely - [Narrator] But the If the crew's shut down why did the vibration suddenly stop in the faulty left engine? - They reduced the power but somehow the left engine settles down. - [Narrator] An important piece (plane engine roars) - You need to get a lot of - What's that? - Do you need any to be a - Okay. - [Narrator] Captain Thomas Welch and First Officer Josef from Bangkok, Thailand to Vienna, Austria. (plane engine roars) The flight is operated by Lauda Air, the brain child of famed Austrian Formula One driver, Niki Lauda. - For me, it was a logical step after retiring from racing to start in this kind of business. And that's what I did with Lauda Air. - [Narrator] Throughout the '70s, Lauda dominated Formula One racing. (car engine reeves) - [Herbert] Niki was the - [Commentator] Lauda still on the lead. - I think Niki is the best - [Commentator] And Niki Lauda takes the flag. - [Narrator] He won the world Then used his fame to launch a - One of the main reasons a different way of flying, better service, better food, the airplane had to look in a certain way. - [Narrator] The Lauda Air into its 11-hour flight to Vienna. It's a road Niki Lauda knows firsthand because he's not just he is also one of its pilots. - When you run a company and because when you are with your passengers, then you know what is going on. You can look yourself And I corrected things quick and that way. - 14, 13, 20. - [Narrator] In the and First Officer Turner while the autopilot controls the climb. (plane engine roars) Suddenly the plane begins (plane engine roars) The pilots have lost control. Lauda Flight 004 is plummeting to earth. (plane engine roars) (plane crashes) The plane slams into a remote jungle 110 miles Northwest of Bangkok. When rescuers arrive, it's immediately obvious that All 213 passengers and - But the airplane took off at 16:01 UTC. There was no fault or whatever The airplane flew about 20 to 25 minutes, and then suddenly disappeared So we have no indication whatsoever happened to the airplane. - [Narrator] Investigators in Thailand have made a surprising find. The thrust reverser on is fully deployed. - Once we actually saw that the for me, it was shocking. It was not anything I really - [Narrator] Thrust come to a stop on landing. They work by redirecting to slow the plane down. - Left side deployed in midair. No doubt. - [Narrator] Planes to prevent reversers from but even if it does happen, In fact, flight testing has Before the 767 first went into service, Boeing had to prove that after a mid-air deployment. - There was a lot of vibration, a lot of noise, but the - [Narrator] The pilots only experienced a small loss of lift. As a result, Boeing certified the 767 as capable of continued under any possible position But the discovery of an engine with a deployed reverser is so unusual. Investigators must related to the crash. - How does the thrust We're missing something. - [Narrator] If it turns out can bring down a plane, it has ominous implications for The lives of hundreds of around the world could be in jeopardy. - We recognized that we had something that was a very unusual and - [Narrator] The deployed thrust reverser is the strongest lead investigators have, but no one can figure out how it could have caused the crash. Investigators will have without their most valuable tool. The flight data recorder that technicians at the but there's better news about It has survived the fire. - Ready to go. - [Narrator] The voice recorder shows a normal takeoff and climb. - All this kind of normal communication, which are done usual to people. So for me, it was honestly hard. This was the hardest part of all my life. - [Speaker] We acutely see - [Narrator] Flight 004 without a problem. A little more than five and a the first hint of trouble. - What's come on? - What's come on? - Some kind of warning. - [Narrator] The pilots that's coming on in the cock pit. Could this be the clue that unlocks the mystery of Lauda Flight 004? Brazil in the late 1980s Today, millions of soccer as their beloved team The critical match in Rio was even a thousand miles where the crew of Varig Flight 254 is getting ready for takeoff. Varig Flight 254 is scheduled to fly North from the mining town of Maraba to Belem near the mouth of the Amazon River. (plane engine roars) Captain Cesar Garcez is While First Officer Nilson - V1. (plane engine roars) - Rotate. - [Narrator] At 5:35 PM, the (plane engine roars) After 23 minutes, the flight that they're getting close to Belem. The pilots try to contact - Belem Tower, Varig - [Narrator] Strangely, they - Belem Tower, Varig 254. Belem Tower, do you read? - That's funny. - What? - We're not picking up the beacon here. - [Narrator] Airports are omni-directional range They send out signals that - Why don't we see if we can pick up a local radio station from Belem. - [Narrator] The captain tries to home in on a local radio signal, hoping it will help guide The do or die soccer game is being broadcast by radio The pilots have managed to pick up a local station broadcasting the match. The captain is confident he spotted a landmark on his radar. - There we go. We're over the Amazon now. - Belem is near the mouth of the Amazon. Following the river should But moments later, there At 8:45 PM, Flight 254 runs out of fuel. The left engine is the first to die. - We just lost an engine. - Hang on. I'm going to put her down. (plane engine roars) - There it goes the other one. - [Narrator] The inevitable - Just needs to bring (plane crashes) - [Narrator] Of the 54 48 have survived. - We have to get you out of here, okay? Can you hear me? - Sorry. - [Narrator] Surviving the crash landing feels like a miracle to but they now face a new They're stranded in the vast no water and no guarantee Investigators look into the possibility that the navigation system on and let the crew off course. They suspect the planes The 737 has a magnetic sensor in the tail that acts as the planes compass, it tracks which direction and feeds that information If something in flight 254's cargo was giving off a strong magnetic field, it might've confused the sensor. They also test every component and check for any sign of failure, but they find nothing in the cargo that could affect the compass. And the instruments are working perfectly. Investigators catch a break, Flight 254's flight plan has been recovered from the cockpit. Airlines provide flight It contains critical details about the route they should fly, including the heading - Oh thanks, but let's see - [Narrator] But what if a faulty flight plan? One that sent them in the wrong direction. This could be the lead - I think I know what they did wrong. - [Narrator] A close look provides a revelation. - In this particular very unusually their has four digits. This is very, very unusual have only three. The numbers 0270 was intended - He was supposed to - And the captain read it So instead of flying Northeast. - They went West instead going 270, they entered the wrong heading. - He set the airplane up to depart West. - [Narrator] 270 degrees is more than 240 degrees past the northerly heading of The moment of truth arrives when they called Captain Garcez back in to give his side of the story. At first, the captain is reluctant to admit he made a mistake. Under intense questioning, he misread the flight plan. - Look it was an honest mistake. - [Narrator] Investigators their flight plans this new way while the captain was on vacation. - It's easy to see how you get confused. - Narrator] But there's another question. The first officer must from the flight plan. - Sir. - Yes, sir, do you think - [Narrtor] Why did he make as the captain? - He could have caught this (plane engine roars) - [Narrator] Varig 254 takes off due West instead of North straight - Get up. - [Narrator] It's an - Did they not realize they That should have been a big queue. They must have been very confident that they had done the right thing. (plane engine roars) - [Narrator] Tocumen International (plane engine roars) - V1. - [Narrator] Copa Airlines Flight 201 takes off for a short - Rotate. (plane engine roars) - Gear up. - [Narrator] Captain Rafael Chial is Copa's most senior pilot. Today, he's monitoring the instruments. - Set thrust to climb. - [Narrator] First Officer Cesareo Tejada is flying the plane. 40 passengers are on board, mostly business travelers The flight usually takes about an hour, but tonight there's a hitch - We've got some heavy weather - [Narrator] Flight 201 is - It looks clear to the East. - [Narrator] The pilots need to find a way to fly around the bad weather. - Agreed, I will let them Panama Center Copa 201, we'd like to get around this weather requesting a new heading for 090. - [Speaker 2] Copa 201 calling back, they're cleared on heading 090. - Cleared heading 090 Ladies and gentlemen we're to avoid some bumpy weather. It may delay our arrival in Cali. I will keep you posted. - [Narrator] The new flight around the storm before (plane engine roars) - Panama Center Copa 201. - [Narrator] It's been - Level at 250. - [Narrator] The captain tells controllers he's reached cruising Minutes later, the plane The controller tries the Graciela Ocana is one of - The flight was leaving entering Columbia airspace. - Hopefully, it's just into rain storm. - [Narrator] The plane's was over Panama's remote Darien Gap. - The last bit of return - [Narrator] The plane has vanished over an almost impenetrable jungle. If Copa 201 crashed here, just getting to the crash Ocana reports the missing - Hey, have you had any - [Narrator] Then comes - Early in the morning, I received a call from a Any survivors? - [Narrator] Witnesses on the ground have reported a terrifying sight. - During the night, they falling from the sky. We had to find out where the aircraft was and if there was anyone - [Narrator] The next day, to the crash site. But all 47 of the people Investigators need to know if was giving the crew of about the position of the airplane. They test the displays and - Well, this one seems to work fine. - [Narrator] They find nothing wrong with the first officer's instruments. - Let's the other one. - [Narrator] And they run the same test on the captain's attitude indicator. At first, the captain's Then they noticed something odd. - Hang on, it seems to be stuck. - [Narrator] Occasionally, freezes in place. The attitude indicator stops moving even though the gyro feeding Investigators need to know They test every wire connecting - No wonder. - [Narrator] Finally, - This wire is hanging by a thread. - [Narrator] The discovery to the bizarre rolling motion captured by the flight data recorder. The captains instrument are both fed by the same gyro. Since the captain's gyro was broken, it was sending faulty Copa 201 didn't really make any quick rolling maneuvers at all. - Okay, let's see what the - [Narrator] By carefully in the flight data recorder, they managed to calculate and reveal the planes true motion. The red image shows the bad while the solid image shows how Copa 201 was actually flying. The plane rolls so far to the right. It becomes unrecoverable, though the pilots don't know it they're now falling from the sky. - Once they got to this point, - [Narrator] But a It was the captain's gyro and started sending bad data. So why did the pilots select it? - Okay, let's start. - [Narrator] Investigators of flight simulator the Copa crew used for their 737 training. - Climbing 25,000 and turn right. - [Narrator] They recreate - Now, trigger the failure. - [Narrator] Including the malfunction of the captain's attitude indicator. - How'd you make the switch? Wait a minute, let me see that. That is not the same switch - [Narrator] Two different configurations for one small control switch has overwhelming implications In the simulator, flipping switches the captain's instrument to an auxiliary gyro On flight 201, flipping puts both instruments on the - Panama Center Copa 201 level at 250. - [Controller] Roger back 201. - [Narrator] With no voice recording from the cockpit of Copa 201, investigators will never know for certain who flipped the switch the wrong way, but they finally collected enough evidence to build a compelling theory of how the flight went so horribly wrong. - It's cargo 37 runway - [Narrator] The MD-11 is for flying cargo. FedEx relies on the plane to haul millions of tons of freight in and out of crucial hubs like Tokyo's Narita Airport, one of the busiest airports in the world. - Narita Tower, FedEx - [Narrator] 54 Year old Kevin Mosley is the captain on FedEx Flight 80. His first officer is The two veteran pilots are - FedEx 80, Narita Tower on runway 34 left continue approach. - FedEx 80 Roger. - [Narrator] Seven minutes from landing, the controller gives the crew an update about the wind conditions on the runway. - Okay, copy that. - [Narrator] The pilots are in A crucial time in any flight. The crew must perform dozens and drop about 400 miles before they touch down. It's a very busy time in the cockpit. On this flight, the pilots to contend with, powerful winds. - Any thoughts on landing speed? - Let's add 10 knots, make it 164 knots. - [Narrator] They need to come in faster than usual to combat the gusty conditions. - Landing gear. - Gear down. - Forward drain. We're cleared to land 34 left, stable. - [Narrator] The plane is It will be on the ground Without warning, the MD11 - There's crash on 34 - [Narrator] Fire crews where a massive blaze of FedEx Flight 80. It's the biggest air disaster the Tokyo Airport has ever seen. Air traffic controllers must away from the burning debris. It takes almost half an to douse the flames By the time rescuers get inside, it's too late for the pilots. Two people are dead and another MD-11 lies burning at the side of a runway. This is the first fatal accident in Narita Airport's 31-year history. The aviation world needs to know why this MD-11 lending went so wrong. Flight 80's cockpit recording is now in the hands of investigators, but will it tell them why the pilots couldn't get their planes - [Speaker 3] Narita Tower Fedex 80. - [Speaker 4] Narita continue approach. - FedEx 80, Roger. - All right, let's begin the - Got it. - So far so good. - [Narrator] The approach - Landing gear. - Gear down. Winds are 320 maximum at 34 dots. - Okay, stop for a second. Winds 320 maximum 34. It's right in their face. - [Narrator] The was flying into a strong headwind, but it wasn't dangerous - Okay, let's go on. - [Speaker 5] 1,000. - Ride them, cowboy. - Don't let the airplane fly And on a gusty blustery day, that's in fact what you have to do. - [Speaker 5] 500. - [Narrator] Despite the bumpy ride, the pilots don't seem very concerned. - Cleared to land 34 left, stable. - Stable approach is one of the call-outs that more and more carriers have put into their that you call out because generally that's a pretty well understood thing. If you're stable, you can land. - One minute from the Seems like there is nothing wrong. - From the recording, we can tell that they were really relaxed I think what happened were so rough that it felt riding an untamed horse like cowboys. - [Narrator] Then an automated gives investigators an important clue. - [Speaker 5] 50, 40, 30, 20, 10. (airplane crashes) - That last part again, please? - [Speaker 5] 50, 40, 30, 20, 10. - It should slow down. 50, 40, 30, 20, 10. - [Narrator] The recording the planes descend didn't but instead continued It explains the hard Another critical question remains, why didn't the pilots slow their descend? Till they can answer that question, investigators won't know the full story behind the crash of FedEx Flight 80. Kennedy makes a final preflight a Piper Saratoga. - That's a top of the line, single engine six seater that a global positioning system. The selling point for the Saratoga was it has four club in the rear of the aircraft. - Seat belts on please. There's some headsets back All right, battery on, fuel pump on, and propeller is clear. - [Narrator] The flight should take about 90 minutes. After that, it's just a - The route from Essex County he was a quite familiar. He had several times. - [Narrator] At 8:40 PM, more than two hours behind schedule, the flight gets underway. - 75 Knots. Oh yeah. - [Narrator] Like many private pilots, Kennedy is flying under - You stay clear of clouds. You have to have good visibility. You're always looking outside, able to see the horizon using your visual cues. - And that's the best view in New York you're ever gonna get. - Once you turn towards the East, you had a nice view of on a good day, you could see, - [Narrator] Kennedy a typical altitude for small planes. Around 9:30 PM, leaves - You can see the Montauk over there. - I don't see a thing. - His flight path was following the coast. So he would want to go south to line up and set up for a long straight end for the runway. - [Narrator] He expects to at about half an hour. - We'll have you on the - [Narrator] But by 10:00 o'clock. - Martha's Vineyard Tower. - Airport security here. - [Narrator] The air traffic controller at Martha's Vineyard Airport has had no contact with the Kennedy plane. - Any word on that plane? - Negative, I haven't been - [Narrator] Overdo but as the hours pass with no a chilling reality sets in. John F. Kennedy, his are missing without a trace. Investigators zero in and a theory that may explain the fatal accident that killed John F. Kennedy Jr, his wife, Carolyn and her sister, Lauren. At the center of it all, a pilot in over his head battling a mounting list of pressures. - No, you shouldn't worry. - I'm having problems at work. I need to get to this wedding. My ankle hurts. I get in the airplane that's I need to get from point A to point B that's the whole point and learning to fly so we're gonna go. - I think I know why - 127.25. - [Narrator] A badly tuned allow investigators to imagine a scenario that may explain the flight's tragic end. - It started after he cleared New York. - [Narrator] In hazy conditions, Kennedy would have no visual reference to tell him which way is up. - As it was getting dark so he was in a very precarious area for Visual Flight Rule, VFR flying. As he headed out over the water and all those lights were behind him, all that visual reference was gone. - He looks away from his - 127.25. - Remember his frequency was off. Maybe he was trying to tune the radio. - He might look to see if or if he had got it wrong in his mind. - Still nothing, just no big deal. - While all that's going on, it's quite easy for the airplane to slip into a little bit of a bank, - If you're in a turn for your inner ear can feel and you can become spatially - What? It can't be. - He looks back, his instruments His sense is another. - You have to be well-trained to disregard what your brain is saying. And look at your instruments, work on your scan and - [Narrator] Once he becomes disoriented, Kennedy is too inexperienced to believe his instruments, no matter what his senses are telling him. - Nothing's working. - So it's the only thing that fits. Spatial disorientation.

But of course the plane was a little bit faster than what I was. I remember thinking This is it for me. (plane crashes) - We have a few minutes. Show me that report. - [Narrator] Despite some damage from fire and impact forces, technicians have been able - We knew we didn't have FDR. We were glad to hear though and that the accident - All right, I think Let's hear it. - [Victor] Victor Mike Charlie, reduce your speed to 180 knots. - Reducing speed to 180 Mike Charlie. - Because it's a small aircraft, we could hear not just all the sounds that were in the cockpit, but we've got also hear - We must be getting close? - [Narrator] As they just before the crash, they hear nothing out of the ordinary. - No leave it. Leave it for now. - One of the things is that there was not a intentional act that brought down the aircraft. There was no sound similar to a struggle. There was no sounds of a explosive device. And so that helped close the book on that aspect of the investigation. - [Narrator] The mystery of what did cause the crash persists. - Flaps down. - [Narrator] Investigators toward the runway. - Look. - Yeah, they will land up in front of us. - [Narrator] All seems well until. - One of the interesting was that the flight crew - [Sanchez] What a hell, Alvaro? - All right sounds like that's where we're 14 seconds - [Narrator] It seems of violently unstable air. - Oh my God. - All of a sudden, boom plummeting towards the ground. - Alvaro, what do we do, Alvaro? - [Narrator] Without the flight data, the voice recording leaves investigators with only a partial picture. - We don't know exactly was thinking at the time. We don't know what control but it shows that there in the cockpit of what to do, how to recover the - They don't seem to know what hit them. - Alvaro, what do we do, Alvaro? - [Alvaro] Give it to me, give it to me. - You know hearing that sound and putting myself in their place, and knowing what that outcome is gonna be, it's gotta be horrible. - It's yours Alvaro. - They tried to pull They had so little time, (sad music) (plane crashes) - We had a normal flight coming in, and then we had a loss of There was no evidence of - So what do you think? Wake turbulence? - So we had to really of a wake turbulence event. - [Narrator] Wake turbulence above the wing draws creating a swirling vortex that trails behind the - As a plane flies along, each of its wingtips is generating a tiny horizontal tornado (plane engine roars) - [Narrator] The powerful for minutes at a time, creating an invisible - When a smaller plane flies of air at low altitude, they can spin out of control and crash into the ground within seconds. - The commuter flight from was supposed to land in Cork at 9:00 AM. - Maybe 30. - [Narrator] 30 minutes later, it's still circling the airport. - Cork faces out to the Atlantic so fog is very common, and fog will roll in and it will roll out sometimes at no notice. - And our part of the it was like pee soup because - Hope we will land soon. I've got work to do. - [Narrator] There are 10 passengers waiting to land this morning, including Laurence for the day on business. - I was going to Cork to I had been in that same location during the same course So it was sorta really old hat - [Narrator] Today's flight is a board of Fairchild Metro III. Flying the plane today is First Officer Andrew Kettle of England, while he concentrates Spanish Captain Jordi Sola Lopez is checking the weather - [Controller 3] The surface wind is calm. Visibility is 900 meters and fog. - All copied and thanks very much. And the weather, is it improving in Cork? - [Narrator] At 9:35, the the fog has lifted slightly. - Visibility and touchdown - Okay, in that case, any chance to perform one approach there? - You are cleared to land runway 17. - Cleared to land runway 17. - [Narrator] After 30 the crew must now shift of getting their plane on the ground. (plane engine roars) - We're good. I've landed in worst. - Life save is coming in. - [Narrator] The pilot confirms the plane is lining up with the runway. - Okay, guys we'll be coming in. - [Narrator] And they're - Speed's okay. - I do control of the air power, okay? - [Narrator] The captain he'll adjust the engine - That's fine, yeah. (plane engine roars) - All the lights are on. Landing gear is down. - Yes, the weather is much better here. (plane engine roars) - Right, I was on the looking at just behind the wing. I remember I couldn't see new runway north from the tower. - [Narrator] The captain to reduce power. Unexpectedly, the plane - What a hell? Go round, go round. - Hang on. I remember looking at the window, I'm seeing the grass a like knew that wasn't good. Thought I was gone. I'd add for a minute or I thought that was that and I might here not also survive it. (plane crashes) - [Narrator] Black box is finally in the hands of investigators, but would it give them the - [Kettle] Oh copied thanks very much. And the weather is it improving in Cork? - [Narrator] The voice recorder has captured the pilot's conversation in the crucial moments before the crash. - [Kettle] Speed is okay. - [Narrator] Liddy listens as the pilots discuss their landing preparations. At this stage, everything seems normal. - I do control of air power, okay? - [Narrator] Then he hears - Yeah, that's fine, yeah. - The captain's gonna handle the power. What kind of plan is that? - They start to deviate by doing things like expecting to have control of the aircraft, - [Narrator] Normally, would be the one adjusting - If someone else is making those changes, there's going to be a from the pilot flying an - [Narrator] But it's not only There's also something odd - The cockpit voice recorder can also give you a lot of information about the acceleration of the engines, the engine speed powered up, So you can actually glean quite an amount of information about that. - [Kettle] Go round, go round. - Can you try and just (plane engine roars) Sounds like those two at different power levels. - The difficulty in this situation is that it's a twin engine aircraft so the cockpit voice recorder will tell you something is going on, but it doesn't tell you - [Narrator] Searching for the mysterious sounds Liddy studies engine performance data from the flight recorder. It confirms his suspicion. The left engine was producing more power than the right engine. Something not uncommon on prop Uneven engine thrust does make to keep the plane flying level, It's one more thing for during a complicated landing. - Wait a minute. - [Narrator] Liddy notices - It looks like engine - [Narrator] Turbo prop or pitch of the blades to - The propeller has an angle and through rotation takes a When selecting reverse, what's happening to the propeller pitch is it's flattening out and going causing air to be pushed - That is one thing you don't because it can actually to below stolen speed so the - [Narrator] The data suggests. - What a hell? - [Narrator] The captain back too far, putting the more power for left engine into reverse. - If one were to do that in flight, you're gonna have a Ford You're going to have an aft In this case, it caused a - Go round. - [Narrator] The captain his mistake by pushing But again, the uneven engine (plane crashes) - Left engine powered up faster, pushed them over to the right. - That roll was I knew I was quite vicious and actually caused airplane - I took him through the air power. - [Narrator] After two aborted landings, perhaps the captain was trying to help the first officer deal by taking control of the throttles. - Okay, minimal. - [Narrator] But it - It's the first officer it had control of the power levers and the yolk, the flight controls, he would have felt and known - And it's the whole task much more difficult because over the power. (plane crashes) - [Narrator] The Canadian Arctic is one of the toughest Winters here are brutal. Eight months long with to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Even now during the long the average temperature There are no roads to Virtually the only way Resolute Bay Airport is equipped with navigational aids for automated landing approaches. First Air Flight 6560 is a and cargo to the small community. First Officer David Hare studied business before setting his sights on aviation. He joined First Air four years ago. - First Air 6560 copied thank you. There we go. - [Narrator] Capt. Blair Rutherford has been with the airline for more than 15 years. - I might as well do yours so. Heading 029 degrees. - Got it. - [Narrator] This close to pilots need to calibrate using their GPS. - Okay, let's go over the approach. - Okay. - Altitude alerts set to 2200. - [Narrator] Because of the heavy fog, the crew will be relying during the approach. - Checklist complete. - Autopilot set. - [Narrator] This way about lining up with a runway visually. The computer will do all the work until they're ready to touch down. - 5560 you're landing on runway 35 True. It's a little wet. - First Air 6560 copy 35 True. - You're 10 miles from run way. (plane engine roars) - [Narrator] At 11:40 AM, Flight 6560 begins its final approach to the runway. - Descending through 1,000 feet. First Air 6560, we're We're over the shoreline now. - Alright. - [Narrator] The sound of an - Go round, go forward. - [Narrator] It's the To the pilots, it seems impossible. They don't even have - Go round. - Go round trash. - [Narrator] The captain but it may be too late. Flight 6560 slams into the The plane skids across the crest of a hill and burst into flames. The priority now, get - I think to yourself while I really hope someone survive this, but you know this is gonna be bad. - At the crash site, Gabrielle Pelkey sits - She found herself with a broken leg, cuts and bruises and concern for her (sad music) - [Narrator] Geologist Nicole - Gabrielle, Gabrielle, God. - When Nicole got to Gabrielle. - You're okay, you're okay. - She made sure that And that was something with her own survival. (sad music) - This is my first plane crash. - Yeah. Me too, sweety. Me too. - For Nicole to hear that from a child, sort of brought home - All right. - Trying to survive at that moment was a way of focusing on each other. - And as they stumbled they find only one other - They managed to get to a location where they felt, okay, this and wait and hope for the best. - [Narrator] The three survivors and shivering in near If help doesn't arrive soon, they may die from exposure. (plane engine roars) News of the disaster reaches still in flight, including - We kind of looked at as if somebody's changing the start of the exercise to create more realism, or is this really happening. We need to hit the ground running. Now you're quickly changing gears into thinking about all the to get ready and start reacting - [Narrator] As the they grapple with the realization that the mock exercise they were expecting is now a very real catastrophe, But there is some good rescuers are able to reach the survivors just 20 minutes after the accident. - There are survivors. Repeat there are survivors. - Having been to several aircraft crashes throughout my 20-year career, shock would be an understatement that these people had survived. They didn't appear to have So we elected to fairly rapidly, stabilize some immediate fractures, get them on some stretchers and get them down to a facility that could properly evaluate and treat them in an environment - [Narrator] Rescuers but they quickly realized no one else has survived the crash. 12 people are dead.
