All right, we're checking out to the core of the earth, with your own tears. It's GTA. We want to find out which vehicle in GTA and most ridiculous pit, where they get worse and worse over time. Eventually, the pits get only one vehicle can beat them, Then, in the end, he's created Let's do this. Baby Pits. Not to be outdone Ooh, okay, they're serious pits. This time, Oh, my God. He's given me the hydraulics, all the different pits Now, in the beginning, than baby pits, because that goes and we're like 600 feet up in the air. I'll just use speed to my advantage. Well, leave it to Gray-- I was going to say, leave it to Gray in the most narrow pit on the whole board. LSD Pits. [laughs] What is it, like sweet rave party pits. Oh, it is. Oh, let me guess, because if they weren't I could just go around the side. I know it's Alex, but I have to test it, [grunts] All right. I thought maybe you know what I mean. I've just been doing this board I wouldn't know the difference anyway. Over the LSD Pit. You know what, let's stop. Let's stop. Let's stop. I'm dead now. Oh, epilepsy. I'm going to leave that car down there because I don't think I've ever used this and it might be amazing. Oh, it's got some good hop in the front, Hey, all right. Now, the Baby Pits over here We just jump these like it's nothing. Oh, yes, simple. Look at that. Oh, God, a little bit of forward hydraulics. Oh, stick the la-- oh, no. I can still stick this landing. Sticks the landing. You know what, Oh, yes, this looks like something really stupid terrain. This should be fine. It's got spunk in the trunk after all. Not much of a hop. The balance on this thing is a little-- Hey, there we are. That was completely controlled. I did that on purpose. Oh, my bumper is hanging off here. I don't need that bumper anyway. It has failed me too often. There we go. Now, this is the one so what we're going to do is, There's the other car, We're going to go or I could just whirl ride this and die. You want to see something really cool. [laughs] Yeet. Oh, what the. Oh, a little bit of the teleporter and it will teleport you up top. That's actually amazing. All right. We're going hard and around this. Oh, God. I'm fine. The vehicle is fine. It's missing a hood, and 95% of the bumper Okay, bring it on. Yes. [grunts] Oh, God, it's like DVRing. Come on. Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. Now. Hey. [laughs] Yes. I have no glass left. Anyway, I finally get to Rescue Pit. Rescue Pit. I don't even know what this is. It's like some sort of disaster film, Oh, that's exactly what this is. You can't-- [dramatic sounds] [laughs] Oh, my, the pit goes This girl is like, Some dude just--. [screaming] That poor guy has to just fall forever, just infinitely. All right. Well, the show must go on. I really need the hydraulics for this, you can go around the side. Oh, these are not dynamic. Alex froze these. I can't actually knock that to the side. Just don't look, Gray. It's going to be fine. Boop. Whoop. [laughs] Oh, God, I lost my car. Oh, no, that's the one thing Is anyone going to ask me if I'm okay. We're picking the blue one. Blue means it's fast. Oh, yes. Oh, listen to this baby car. Oh, this is like blue fire. Get ready. Boop. See that. All right, here we go. Yes. Oh, just keep it. Just keep the speed, Gray. Go. I only had to murder one individual Oh, that's why he gave me the rocket pickup. Oh, it's lifting a car out of a giant pit. I love how elaborate he made these pits. There's a person in there. What. [laughs] to move your helicopter, They're probably like, how to count to 30.&quot; &quot;You're right. Missiles are the universal countdown.&quot; Ugh. [laughs] Bye. The guy's just stopped on the side of-- Oh, there was a random dude standing completely unscathed. Also, YouTube, there was still alive. I'm getting rid of everything. Oh, no. No, no, no. Come on, it was right there. No. I'm fine. I've got a new plan. We haven't really tried any long cars, That's how you get past the pit. Your car is so long and this car happens No one throws money away. All right, the hydraulics are not great, Oh, this thing's longer than the pits. Look at it. I did no damage to this thing, Oh, I just barely touched it. It's had probably the best run out It's not very fast, and it's really long, so that does help. We just have Perfect. Now we have to shoot down this, Oh, my God. No, no, no, this would've been awesome. No, I ramped a helicopter for this. [somber music] the helicopter is trying to mount me It is viciously coming for me. It is on fire, Maybe seeing yourself, Gray. What are you doing. Oh, I'm fine. Michael Bay. Every day I'm going for this thing. This thing's super fast, It has everything. All of the cars this is all of those combined. Look at this. Boom. Bam. If I remember correctly as well, on this thing. Oh, God. You know what. Just go, Gray. Everything's fine. LSD pit number two. No problem. Then through the rescue pits. I'm sorry. Oh, no. Oh, boy. Oh, I've hit everyone on the way down. No one's getting rescued today. Haven't tried a big offroad truck yet. Six wheels. Six wheels. Six reasons why this board. Come on. I need to see what is past the Rescue Pits. So far, so good. Here we are. Did that in the most difficult way possible, I'm glad I didn't lose my run. There we are. A little bit of a bounce there. Just keep the speed going, and that guy's fine. We're going to shoot this now, trying to ramp it. Oh, now it's just blocking the way. Now everything's on fire. Now everything's on fire. Oh, now I'm on fire. I think the fire got put out. We're fine. Sorry. I wasn't sure how, Now there's an obstacle. Maybe I can ramp this. Oh, it worked out perfectly. What's it say. The Abyss Pit. The Abyss. [laughs] Okay. Like the movie, I can't see. Is it a black hole. Oh, there's something here. Am I supposed to go down there, It's amazing. It looks like it's just a hole. Where does it end. Alex wouldn't just let me cheat this, Gray needs to investigate this. Oh, it literally has no end. I can test it. Yeet. I don't know where that went. All right, I'll just cheat it then. Oh, okay. All right. I expected Alex to do something like that. All right, Abyss Pit, it's you versus me. Let's see who is superior. Oh, wow. Okay, I didn't even-- Oh, I'm stuck. A few hours later. Okay, the Abyss is no joke. Once you get into it, That is a place and not be able to get them back. I like this one. Hey, bump it. Nice. Then we're going to bump it. Ooh, bump that late. [laughs] Wow, that was pretty close for comfort. Into the explosions. Take down the helicopter. Are you ready. Ah, come on. You know what. I have an idea. There is one motorcycle Well, one two-wheeled motorcycle. I think I can cheat Now watch, you can obviously jump these, Let me put my helmet on. Now I think I do have to legitimately-- Ouch. Ah, no. Oh, my God. What. You and me, bike, we are inseparable. Oh, see over there to the left, bad memories. What I'm going to do The bike is still in good shape. New plan. Ramp it. Yes. Oh, that worked. All right, so now motorcycle Rescue Pits. Boom. Got it. Oh, let me get the rocket. I ended up going over it. Fire these, Okay, let's try and not miss this time. Hey, yay, it is. Oh, yes. Oh, the motorcycle might be now I have to get past the Abyss Pit. Now the only way I can think of to do this Just pop right out of it. I love waffles. [cheers] [laughs] Alex is just making stuff up now. The Smoothie Pit. Okay. All right. Oh, the coke and sludgy smoothie. Okay. All right. Oh, wow. Oh, okay. This is actually interesting. I've been ramping the back wall, Can I cheat this around this way. Oh, I could totally cheat this. Alex. [laughs] It's taken this long. [laughs] Oh, God. All right. Could this one be cheated, too. What is that in the background. We'll see it when we get there. How about over this burger patty. Yes, like that right there. Look at this. Oh, yes. I think I can jump this. All right, hold on. Maximum speed. No, what happened. I didn't. No, no, no. [yelps] My bike. No, my bike's getting smoothied. Well, I'm getting smoothied, I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is The bad news is so there's just literally nothing I can do. Oh, my God. Oh, what is this car doing. What was that. What is this. What kind of anti-physics Oh, is this the secret car. Is this the one that can make it. Any time I tried the bike would flip out. It would just go completely insane. There was nothing I could do about it. Ooh, I think that the bike was a troll. It was there but you can't beat the board with it. Right when I saw this pit, I was like, it can legitimately be wall-rided.&quot; I just have to find out where to go. There it is. Nice. All right, It's really hard. Yes. That was the other problem There's no ramp or anything, and then you get blended. We're going even faster then. How about that. Oh, boy. All right, well, One million time's the charm. Now. Yes, rescue pit. I'm sorry. Oh, I didn't hit anyone. Everyone gets to be rescued. Yay. I have to the time this, and well, Hey, you can get off to the side. Yes. Now the beer and cheeseburger smoothie. This one, the-- That's really easy to get up on this car. I might try and cartwheel this. You may say to yourself, Bad ideas are what this channel is made of. Oh, stop the roll. Yes, yes. Smoothies. Yes. Oh, what's that say. Mystery Pits. Mystery Pits. All right, what is that-- There's actually an entire mystery symbol Mystery Pit can set you one pit ahead or one pit back. Really. Okay, so this is a pit All right, well, you know what. Alex is the type of person who would make I'm going to jump it. He's giving me ramps. They're just really tiny. I guess what I'll do is just chassis slide What happened. What happened. Well, I guess now I get to see frontward or backward, The ramps are just fake. All right, what kind of luck do I got. Really. I knew it. I told you he would make them go back. I told you, Oh, God. This car has one door left. How come these are fake. What. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, so this color's fake, The color of my car, basically, purple. My timing is impeccable. Oh, come on. It's okay. It's okay. I think that by the time my car is looking worse My car is smoking. All right, baby, because I want to know what comes next. Chassis slide. Perfect. Okay, so this one would be-- Does that mean Well, hold on. If the last pit went back, God, I still don't know I'm going to try and jump this. Again, I do not feel like going back again, [car crashes] oh, God, it's the blue one, Gray. Jesus. Well, we get to see if he's a liar or not. [gasps] Oh, it did. It went through one of the pits. What. Is that a windmill pit. It is. It's a wind turbine pit. Are they spinning. Oh, it's is spinning windmill, Whoa, the windmill goes right to the ground. Can I go around this. Can I cheat this. He puts chopsticks, so you can't cheat it. Okay, listen, I've tried almost every car. It's bad. This one did really well I think that this is It's got incredible top speed The whole front of the car comes up. Look. Oh, God. Oh, yes, we're fine. The whole front of the car Watch this. Bouncing. All right. Now we want purple. Okay, so it's going to go on the right. Launch it. Oh, wow. Oh, my God. If this one's wider, maximum speed. Come on. No. Oh, wait. This is the one that goes forward. It's okay if I mess up that one. Thank you, god, Oh my God, they're both spinning Well, they're not spinning in different directions, They're staggered. Look at them. Do it. [car crashes] Just once, I want to get this one. Come on. Yes. Oh my God, Oh, what. Oh, I never got to read this Windmill Pits but with a twist. Okay, so the windmills do have a twist. We're going to just line this up Just keep going, Gray. Just don't stop. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Ow. Real quick, guys, now that we're here-- Now that we're here, I said it a while back, It looks like a tornado. There's nothing they have in common. What do tornadoes and pits have in common. Absolutely nothing. Whoa, who, whoa. Don't fall off the edge. Don't fall off the edge. There, and we have a checkpoint. This is called the Florida Pit. [chuckles] On the plus side, because we have a checkpoint, What is going on. Oh my God, it's drawing in stuff around it. It's moving me towards the epicenter. [laughs] No, no. Oh. Wow. Did you make this, Alex. There's people in there. There's cows in there. Okay, there's boulders and cars, and there's a tree and an oil tanker I knew it. All right. Are all these ramps real. Okay, the ramps are real. I assume he gave me three ramps a full jump with this or smaller jumps. Whoa. I was going to say, I don't know with the rockets. The thing it's doing which probably makes my life even worse. I'm living on a prayer. Here we go. You know what, we're just going Normal ramp. Oh, I was almost there. Normal ramp, sideways. What. All right, you know what we're going to do. We're going to stay low. Oh, wow. That didn't do any better. I don't care what it takes. Shoot them. Oh my god, I killed myself. [chuckles] shooting the Floridian hurricane I know it's a tornado, but to Alex, all the time. We have a lot of hurricanes. Man, I'm starting to wonder &quot;I'm sure Gray can get past it.&quot; Come on. Ah, that was the closest I've gotten. I've done this a lot. The key is definitely to go low. You want a low chassis slide. [cheers] Oh yes. Oh my God, Yes. Alex says that that checkpoint leads to the final boss pit, and this is It's a train. The fact that I legitimately get I just had to go test The train's really strong along the line. You ready for this. [laughs] Oh my God, this I'm sorry, we got to do the challenge. Okay, onto the tracks, climb up the hill, Oh, it's like a-- Okay. The tracks go-- and then you have It's so wide. There's a boat in the middle. [chuckles] It's fine. It's fine. I will trust in Alex. Obviously, Alex knows what he's doing. I don't know if I can get enough speed. Oh, wow, I have an idea. What we're going to do and then I'm going to ramp the boat. Also, I lost my trailer. Is it Michael Bay or Michael Gray. Oh. [laughs] Oh my God. Yes. We have a winner. [chuckles] Well, I found out It's my sadness. Until next time, stay foxy and much love.
