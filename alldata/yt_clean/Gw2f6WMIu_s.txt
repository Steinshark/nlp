- This month's artist via the Deep Discog Dive Decision. I'll be picking next month, but feel free to suggest artists And check out the Spotify It has all the songs from Welcome back to the Deep Discog Dive Oh, hey, how's it going? I'm busy writing the first musical DDD. They say that talking about music is like dancing about architecture, so why not sing about music, and build skyscrapers Turns out that second one so I'll just forget about the couple million I invested in that. Today, we're talking about (upbeat music) Let's take it back to Three architecture students, Roger Waters, Nick started playing music in their free time. Their original name was Sigma 6, but over the next three years, they would see a whole including Leonard's Lodgers, the Meggadeaths, and the Tea Set. While they were called the Roger's childhood friend, Syd Barrett. He would eventually become the following year. During that same year, Syd suggested another name The change came about that just so happened to have another band called The Tea Set. The group's profile grew steadily in 1966. They got two managers, They became regulars at venues and UFO Club. Their set lists moved and more towards Syd Barrett's own songs. By 1967, the Pink Floyd, signed with EMI. Their first two singles with EMI, &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; and &quot;See Emily Play&quot; both reached the top The stage had been set The same year as their deal with EMI, and their first singles, &quot;The was released in August 1967. For reasons that will be clear in a bit, &quot;Piper&quot; is kind of singular in It's the album most mainly because of Syd Barrett's artistic control over the group. It's also whimsical, really whimsical. Considering the albums this I was a bit shocked to about a gnome named Grimble Gromble, childhood fairytales, ancient Chinese texts, existential scarecrows. And the music behind it has one heck of a surrealistic slant, often pulling in baroque orchestration, and odd production techniques. Sure, later albums might and in line with the sound but did those albums have &quot;Bike?&quot; I'll give you anything, Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, Even with the psych rock leaning, there are tracks here that signal where the Specifically, the spaced-out instrumentals &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; and When it comes to debut albums, they sure don't get as eccentric as &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn.&quot; And though its eccentricity in the group's history Recording for a new album began almost immediately but as work progressed the band In part due to the band's and in part due to his acid and LSD usage, Syd Barrett's mental health In fact, several of the were cancelled because And for the shows they did The other band mates tried to help him, but after a certain point, they realized something needed to change. In late December of '67, David Gilmour was added And by March of the next year, Syd Barrett was officially Syd would have a few credits and would go on to release two solo albums before stepping out of the This might be where Syd left Pink Floyd, but I want to make clear, not only would he go for a whole host of artists, but his character and his absence would be major influences The band's two managers so Steve O'Rourke came in to replace them, to manage the band from here on out. And to top it all off, they took Sean Parker's famous advice. - Drop the &quot;the.&quot; - [Nick] Pink Floyd's second album, &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; As you might imagine from its saucy title, this was the band's first I'm a big fan of the three-part opener &quot;Let There Be More Light.&quot; As an intro track it exemplifies the band would become known for. Speaking of longer songs, we also have the band dipping ambient experimentation pool, with songs like &quot;Set The Controls and the title track. Elsewhere on the album, there are flickers of what that were bogged down by The vocal harmonies on if only there were kazoos. (kazoo music) Oh, thank Christ. &quot;See-Saw&quot; was initially titled &quot;The Most Boring Song So, take that for what you will, but closing things out is &quot;Jughead Blues,&quot; one of the last Pink Floyd Also, this actually means this is the only album of Pink Floyd's to have all five main members on it. A Salvation Army band only to be cut off abruptly to have Syd muse about A pretty perfect way and his time with the band. If anything, &quot;Saucerful&quot; is it represented for the band. It was the first album by Roger Waters. It was their first album by British art group Hipgnosis, who would do the covers for the band's main albums up to 1977. And it was the album that first showed where the band would go sonically for the next five years or so. A lot of &quot;Saucerful of Secrets&quot; could almost soundtrack a sci-fi movie, so it's fitting that would be a movie soundtrack. The band were contacted by most known for art house He invited Pink Floyd for an upcoming film of his, which the band were pretty pumped to do. They figured if music didn't work out, they could always soundtrack &quot;Boss Baby.&quot; About a year after &quot;Saucerful&quot; &quot;More&quot; was released in June 1969. I don't have much to say about &quot;More.&quot; It's nothing terrible, but it doesn't reach the that the last two records do, but there are still &quot;Green is the Color&quot; is that could pass as a and it's followed by fan &quot;Ibiza Bar&quot; and &quot;The Nile Song&quot; are two of the hardest sounding songs from the band's early years. And &quot;A Spanish Piece&quot; is More definitely has some of Pink Floyd's more adventurous tracks from this era, but it's not imperative the whole album to find them. Between albums, Pink Floyd and everyone had a time. The band's next album &quot;Ummagumma&quot; was released in November 1969. This one was Pink Floyd's first double LP, and, truly, &quot;Ummagumma&quot; The first side is a live album, two tracks from &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets,&quot; one from &quot;Piper,&quot; and fan favorite &quot;Careful That last one is my favorite The second half is where things get weird. Essentially, each band with no input from any other member. And the results are interesting. I like the piano throughout particularly in part two, but I'd be lying if I said from his four-part suite. Waters' contributions &quot;Grantchester Meadows,&quot; and the musique concrete piece &quot;Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave The latter had Waters warping, and speeding up various sounds, and had him donning a Scottish I'm only a little bit Crazy Frog's &quot;Crazy Sounds.&quot; Nick Mason's piece is &quot;The complete with a seven David Gilmour's &quot;The Narrow Way&quot; suite is probably the best on here, if only because it's the a fully conceived piece of music. Sales for &quot;Ummagumma&quot; but both Waters and Gilmour for the album in the years since. Me personally? I'm somewhere in the middle. The first half has some great live cuts. The second deserves some recognition for what it showed in each band member. Does that mean I'm Probably not, but it's albeit more in concept than execution. The band did some more this time just a few &quot;Zabriskie Point.&quot; Afterwards, they went back into Abbey Road to work on &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; which released in October 1970. This has a similar The first half is the titular suite, with part names like &quot;Breast and &quot;Mind Your Throats Please.&quot; Because of Abbey Road's and EMI's own restrictions, Roger and Nick had to for this 23 minute long song in one go, but even with that I liked this piece, especially the greater emphasis which fits the gang's music well. When we talk about Pink Floyd's early &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; is certainly one of the The second half, also, like &quot;Ummagumma&quot; features solo compositions Roger's and David's contributions definitely showed a clear over their &quot;Ummagumma&quot; cuts, but then you have Nick Mason's track, &quot;Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast,&quot; which has the band doing musique concrete under one of their roadies describing what he had Overall, &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; from Pink Floyd's early days. Though, with these post-Syd albums, I keep feeling like the whole is less than Like the elements of greatness are there, but the glue to keep them out of the crusty Elmer's Pink Floyd toured for a good If you want to hear a great check out the &quot;Meddled&quot; After touring they spent working on a new album. On engineering duties whose name might be familiar to you. Among a whole bunch of other credits, he would go on to produce The recording process this time was definitely more scattershot. The band didn't have a clear focus, instead choosing to experiment Helping their process, partway through recording from which had a 16-track tape machine. So not only could they record more, but they also could unlike what they had to do The result of their studio released in October 1971. To start, I really like &quot;One with the ostinato in the bass, organ keys, and the bluesy jam going &quot;Fearless&quot; is another good cut. I like that ascending guitar hook, and the fade in of a crowd singing &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone&quot; is I even like &quot;San Tropez&quot; a It feels like the band is starting to nail these Seamus, what are you But &quot;Meddle&quot; is often remembered not because of those tracks, but because of its closer &quot;Echoes.&quot; Overhead the albatross Hangs motionless upon the air This is not to dismiss and the past five albums, but &quot;Echoes&quot; is the point where Pink Floyd became the Pink Floyd you know. Each section from the to that quality descending riff, to the blues section the best &quot;Rolling Stones&quot; to the empty cavernous ambience then back into the main section &quot;Echoes&quot; is the closest thing we have to a definitive turning point where the band's experimentation coalesced into something truly potent, as opposed to experimental noodling. If anything, it's a bummer that &quot;Echoes&quot; just overshadows the rest of the album. It's like when your parents as their favorite over the rest of you except one of them does actually suck. &quot;Meddle&quot; is the first record in my chronological Pink Floyd the greatness this band were capable of. And the next record would all preconceptions of what another movie soundtrack. Pink Floyd toured again soon They also began working on another album, something about a moon, or something. I don't know, I don't listen to music, but as all that was going on, they were contacted to provide a soundtrack Said soundtrack was as &quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot; in June 1972. I really don't have much It's all right. The two tracks I'd recommend you check out are the single &quot;Free Four&quot; The latter is one of David Gilmour's better compositions from this era, otherwise, it's the same deal as &quot;More,&quot; an interesting diversion, All right, what's this about a moon? A few months after &quot;Obscured By Clouds&quot; the band released &quot;Live at Pompeii&quot; a performance they did to an A pretty excellent live worth checking out if in any capacity. By the film's release, head deep into the making The initial concept was lunacy in part inspired by what they Unlike past records, Pink before committing it to tape. Not only did it allow the band to tweak and tinker the material, but said material was from anyone who saw it. They eventually went into Abbey Road, with engineering handled by Alan Parsons. In March of 1973, &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; was released. - Hey, for those of you who please play now. - And just like that, into the absolute stratosphere of rock. Critics loved this thing, it was as if Pink Floyd gave birth to all of progressive Plus, in the U.S. the new felt bad that they didn't so they went all out in They finally starting seeing some real success in the states. Rapturous praise and all earned by an album that is very good. Ah, okay, look, I am not about to drop a galactic brain take, and say &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is bad actually. &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; Easily the most immediately the band had made up to this point. And there are plenty of &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; for example, has a stunning guest She actually sued EMI in 2004 as opposed to just a performing credit, and all pressings of this album after 2005 have her listed as a writer. &quot;Money&quot; will probably be as the de facto example of a song in 7/4 until the end of time. 7/4 not even once, but it's got a great the band's first real hit in the U.S. &quot;Time&quot; is another great highlight, though I keep thinking that David Gilmour says adulting at one point, but he actually says &quot;A dull day,&quot; but man, if the first half then the second half is also good. I said it before this is a good album. I love the dynamic contrast and the choruses on &quot;Us and Them,&quot; plus how those vocal harmonies just melt together so beautifully topped off with a glorious sax solo. And let's not forget the closing pair of &quot;Brain Damage&quot; and &quot;Eclipse.&quot; &quot;Brain Damage&quot; might title drop in all of music. I'll see you on the And &quot;Eclipse&quot; the chord with the added vocal A fantastic closer. Now I recognize that I've been saying a lot of positive things about this album, but I'll qualify it. In my opinion, what takes to an all-time personal classic Something about it that just which makes the precious album a core part of your musical personality. Clearly, &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; nails that essence for so many, and there are moments but that extra something-something This is totally just a I am not saying that thing So yeah, I'm not fawning over &quot;Dark Side,&quot; but, also, who cares? Like, my opinion is not going to suddenly turn the cultural tide This record has achieved a that has only been equaled by what? Four other albums ever. It is a landmark touchstone of an album, one that has brought joy and So many see this as perfect. I see it as very good. We have now officially entered &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; was the most critically acclaimed record Pink Floyd had released so far, and it launched them into but with that came new which would follow them The gang came back to Abbey and the sessions this time around were much more strenuous than &quot;Dark Side.&quot; Everyone was just kind for different reasons, plus they were battling the when you've made every college Despite all that, the band preserved to in September 1975. Believe it or not, critics initially weren't saying it was devoid of So is the phrase &quot;I love this album,&quot; but I'm still gonna say it. &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot; are the band's first explicit disses against the music industry. I love Gilmour's yelling on the former set against these piercing synths that sound like they're impaling you. The latter is apparently a with a greedy executive following &quot;Dark Side's&quot; success. And the title track is that many have interpreted Though, if we're gonna we have to talk about &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond.&quot; As a singular nine-part suite, &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; might be the greatest What makes it special to me is that if feels like a which, yeah, that's obvious, Your experiences with them, the low points where they frustrated you, their strengths, their flaws, and the cumulative looking back on all the time you shared together. Shine on you crazy diamond There are so many great aspects to it. That four note motif in the opening, so perfectly evoking The triumphant sing-along chorus. That sick meter change in The synth solo kicking off part six, a funk breakdown in part eight, and the callback to the melody from &quot;See Emily Play&quot; in part nine. An all-out classic, and in how far Pink Floyd had It's also worth mentioning now a certain event that happened while they were mixing &quot;Shine On.&quot; On the last day of mixing, a man with a shaved head and eyebrows came in without saying a word. At first, nobody paid this guy any mind, but after some time they realized it was Syd Barrett. From all accounts, it was a very surreal and it would also be the last time that most of Pink Floyd saw Syd. It's kind of perfect during what may be the the band has made thus far, and what is my favorite The same year as &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; the band bought a bunch with the intent of turning them into a full recording studio. The sessions for this next album definitely showed Roger in the songwriting. Aside from one credit to The band's tenth album &quot;Animals&quot; was released in January 1977. &quot;Animals&quot; is something hasn't been so far, it's angry. I mean, the last album had songs that were directly the music industry, but they weren't mad in the same way that a lot of the songs on &quot;Animals&quot; are. More specifically, the is based on George Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm,&quot; though, while that book was &quot;Animals&quot; is a critique of capitalism. You can kind of get that depicting Battersea Power Station, which was actually turned into in the late 2010s. Don't you love metaphors? Me neither. Also shout-out to the flying pig, loved its performance Like &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; &quot;Animals&quot; is only five tracks, though, in practice it's &quot;Dogs,&quot; &quot;Pigs (Three &quot;Dogs&quot; is probably the best representation of the album's ethos. Slows and turns to stone &quot;Pigs (Three Different as he decries those who hoard wealth, and force those underneath It also has a talk box so it's To be honest, though, &quot;Sheep&quot; is probably my I love the crashing synths the two synth led breakdowns, and, oh, those guitars on the Remember that guy who said this album was only three main songs? That guy was a dummy, because the two different that bookend this album are quite lovely, and help to make this album not feel as despondent Overall, &quot;Animals&quot; is another not only expanding musically but incorporating more topical I wonder if they'll continue on that road. Just a heads-up that for this album, we're gonna be getting into If you'd rather not feel free to skip to the next album. In support of &quot;Animals&quot; Pink Floyd went out on their And everyone kind of hated it. - [Roger] Oh, for (bleep) sakes, stop letting off fireworks, I'm trying to sing a song. - Roger Waters, especially, he he hated the noise from the audience. He hated it so much that he and the audience separated by a wall. That said, if you want from this era there's a recording &quot;Animals&quot; and &quot;Wish Definitely worth checking out. After the tour, the gang or worked on other band's albums. Most notably was David Gilmour named, Kate Bush, with her first album, but amidst all that, In 1978, Roger presented two concepts for a new album to the band, and they picked the one then The process from there as a wee bit hellish. First, to help manage the project, producer, Bob Ezrin, was brought in. The relationship between him and Waters was contentious as all heck, with the two men's strong personalities creating a tense environment. It also didn't help that in an attempt to get the band lost just a few million pounds in high-risk investments. The fallout led to the band having to live outside of in order to avoid high The most severe result was the worsening relationship between Waters and Richard Wright. And due to that and a variety Wright left Pink Floyd shortly before this new album was done. So with all that working against them, what did Pink Floyd give us this time? They gave us a rock opera, &quot;The Wall&quot; released in November 1979. Oh, boy, let's do this. First let's tackle the plot of &quot;The Wall.&quot; The story follows a rock star named Pink, and the bricks that construct His father's death in World War II, his mother raising him by herself, teachers abusing him in school, his wife becoming distant and As he becomes isolated from the world, he locks himself in a hotel Eventually Pink's manager finds him, and in order to get him out for a show, decides to counteract the As he is carried out onto the stage, Pink then imagines himself as a fascist leader holding a rally, which then turns into It's here where Pink snaps Now feeling tremendous guilt, he puts himself on figurative trial, and, ultimately, tears Next, let's acknowledge It's so much a lot that the album inspired a full arena tour, a 1982 and a handful of full album performances by Waters in the years since. Also, if you're curious like I was, why those performances are attributed to Waters, specifically, and not the rest of Pink It is the culmination of that have appeared in the and it's wrapped in a narrative and occasionally uncomfortable. At least on a thematic level, this is basically a So if you're listening to you might be sort of blown away by the sheer existence of it all, but after listening and does &quot;The Wall&quot; still stand up? Yeah, it's pretty good. I think, in lesser hands, this project could have we really do be living in a but I'll remind you that Pink Floyd were still in their sicko period, and thus most of &quot;The Wall&quot; from the past three albums. Most crucially, the heart of the album lies in Pink's trauma and the childhood he effectively lost, and if those elements weren't there, this whole project could &quot;In The Flesh ?&quot; is an excellent opener, not only establishing the but also two musical motifs I love the lumbering sparseness of &quot;Another Brick in the Wall Part One&quot; into &quot;Happiest Days of Our Lives&quot; with a dash of musique concrete, then into the well-known single, &quot;Another Brick in the Wall Part Two.&quot; A faux-disco jam about the oppression, and abuse of Waters' education. Hey, teacher, leave those kids alone &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Blue that hit especially hard but I'll get those in a sec. I will say, though, the album's pacing starts to The songs from &quot;Empty Spaces&quot; are fine in the context of the album, and the story they tell, but most of them don't as individual songs except for &quot;Hey You&quot; that's a great song, but, thankfully, the is pretty spectacular. David Gilmour didn't have many writing credits on &quot;The Wall,&quot; but one of them was &quot;Comfortably Numb,&quot; so I think he came away with a W. I adore this song. It has one of the best choruses and one of Gilmour's I have become comfortably numb From there, &quot;In The depicts the fascist hallucination while bringing back the &quot;Run Like Hell&quot; and make one hell of a combo, for the hate crime section The rest of the album after that is fine. Worth highlighting is &quot;The Trial&quot; having Waters vocalize against an orchestra. Also, along with the album, I checked out the film It's directed by Alan Parker, with animation by Gerald Scarfe. Also the actor playing Pink, Bob Geldof, was one of the organizers of I'll say this, the movie of &quot;The Wall&quot; you can engage with. The high points of the album when accompanied by dramatizations the Blitz, Pink doing a fascism. Seeing Pink destroy his hotel room, and throw his TV out the but like the album, the Oh, and while Scarfe's animation the caricatures in the - Join me, Link, and I will make your face or else you will die. - Like, it's not just me, right? But still, if you're interested, &quot;The Wall&quot; as a movie is worth the watch, even if it is the version of this project that goes most into gawrsh we really do be living in a As a full-blown media franchise, &quot;The Wall&quot; is an but it's also the kind of work that brings with it a heavy cost. In this case, this album was the start of a year's long process that would effectively destroy the band. As I mentioned before, the band went out on a lavish arena tour to promote &quot;The Wall&quot; for A live album called &quot;Is was eventually released though, it's not available Plus there was the Speaking of the film, Roger Waters initially to be its soundtrack, which would have been from &quot;The Wall&quot; sessions, However, Britain's role led Waters to pivot and Once again, tensions were quite Gilmour wanted to move Waters thought Gilmour Nick Mason was just left Also, on deck for this one who worked on &quot;The Wall&quot; movie, and would go on to work &quot;Lethal Weapon,&quot; and &quot;The Iron Giant.&quot; &quot;The Final Cut&quot; was Remember how I said &quot;The Wall&quot; was thematically a Well, &quot;The Final Cut&quot; is just The last two albums could be angry, but &quot;The Final Cut&quot; is pained. Roger Waters could be This one feels like a On one hand, the strongest moments on here rival those on &quot;The Wall.&quot; That scream in &quot;The Gunner's Dream,&quot; which is actually part focusing on one of the teachers from &quot;Another Brick in the Wall.&quot; The piano on &quot;Paranoid There's also &quot;When the Tigers Broke Free&quot; which was in &quot;The Wall&quot; I'm thankful it got an official release because it's a really about Waters losing his father in the war. In its lesser moments, though, it can definitely feel like Reviews of this one were Gilmour has outright but I gotta say it's not too bad. And it shows Waters still had great ideas after making a mongo chongo That said, to call it a Pink Floyd album would feel disingenuous. It's a Roger Waters album featuring the members of Pink Floyd. I think that's in part why &quot;The Final Cut&quot; is also the group's first album in a while that feels like a retread They would need to shake so what did they do? Lawsuits. The years after &quot;The Final Cut&quot; were dedicated to the David Gilmour's second album, Nick Mason's second album, Roger Waters' first album. That last record, &quot;The Pros was actually the second concept right before they began It was after &quot;Hitch Hiking&quot; that Roger Waters announced which was news to everyone What followed was a whole with EMI threatening to sue and Waters attempting and prevent Pink Floyd That didn't work out, so leaving the Pink Floyd but Waters was able to walk away with the conceptual rights to &quot;The Wall,&quot; which is why the adaptations are credited to Waters specifically. Sessions for the first Pink Floyd album without Waters were less tense, which let the gang do than on past records, drum machines, MIDI. They even thought about That said, the atmosphere could often feel more dismal. Gilmour and Mason found it hard to write instead choosing to bring Though, on a positive note, Storm Thorgerson from Hipgnosis and Richard Wright came back on keys, though, for legal reasons, he had to be hired on With an environment that could you might start to think wouldn't be worth the trouble. You might even call its creation a momentary lapse of &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; was released in September 1987. So after a pair of what were effectively Roger Waters' solo albums, Well, it's basically a A good chunk of the material on here was initially meant for and he later decided to rework In fact, the biggest criticism you'll see levied against this one is that it doesn't sound a but I'll push back on that slightly. I think it does sound like Pink Floyd. (funky music) It's just a really dated The band's final album of the '80s is the most '80s sounding On one hand, the lean does inspire some interesting I like &quot;One Slip&quot; for example. The ambient yet percussive opening, segueing into the massive sounding drums. &quot;Terminal Frost&quot; is a even though according to my research it's hated by a lot of people, but man I can't hate and that sax solo. Lead single &quot;Learning to though it feels radio-friendly in a way that no Pink Floyd Not that being radio-friendly but for Pink Floyd it but on the other hand, the production can lead to the band has ever made. &quot;The Dogs of War&quot; reminds me of the blues they were writing on &quot;Wish but something about the vocal makes it comes off as obscenely corny. &quot;Yet Another Movie&quot; strikes of Phil Collins &quot;In The Air Tonight.&quot; And while I did like &quot;Terminal Frost&quot; I don't know why it's between &quot;A New Machine Parts One and Two.&quot; Two interludes that add absolutely nothing to the pace of the album. I should also mention that between &quot;The Final Cut&quot; and this is Roger Waters missed As a guitarist and musician, As a lyricist, he is. In fact, it's interesting so wildly from Waters' on &quot;The Final Cut&quot; to Gilmour's technically proficient if a bit cold demeanor on this. You know what this album reminds me of? David Bowie's &quot;Never Let Me Down.&quot; They're both records that push but end up losing part of what makes their respective They're also records that got In &quot;The Later Years&quot; box they included a new version of The biggest change was all the by Mason who had expressed disappointment in the original album's percussion. Like &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; 2018, this new version won't change but it's an interesting compliment. So in total, &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; is not what its title Sure, the band were feeling creatively, and legally burnt out, but David Gilmour could have rapped on it. Pink Floyd did two rounds of They eventually got back The recording sessions, compared to &quot;The Final were easygoing and dare I say enjoyable. Not having to deal with Along with the returning the gang also brought in Polly Samson to help with lyrics. With a more hospitable the group wrote a ton of with a good chunk of them being left on the cutting room floor. I hope we get to hear them at some point. Yes, I can finally add a new that I'll never regret saying. &quot;The Division Bell&quot; was a year when the big bands were singing about and all the people. In contrast to the Brit pop of the time, &quot;The Division Bell&quot; is lush showing the band and associated personnel as true studio artisans. There's just one issue, though. Past Pink Floyd albums could also be lush, and immaculately recorded, but the best ones also had And therein lies the weakness It just kind of happens. I mean, you put it on, you and when you're finished listening, you're left with a feeling The album's at its best when the songs manage to and dynamic contrast. &quot;Poles Apart&quot; &quot;What Do You Want From Me?&quot; The very U2 sounding &quot;Take It Back,&quot; even single &quot;High Hopes,&quot; which is one of the more divisive cuts in the band's catalog, but there's only so many times you can hear David Gilmour's before you think to As an example, I guess of being marooned either but it's also a pale imitation of past Pink Floyd instrumentals. It's also the only Pink so, there's that. If there's one unabashedly good thing about &quot;The Division Bell&quot; though, it's Richard Wright's increased presence. In his book about the band, Nick Mason noted how Rick in the music making process on here, and considering how much he I'm glad he got to take on more of a role. &quot;The Division Bell&quot; is often in Pink Floyd's discography, Still, I think these guys were too far along in their careers to make something truly bad. It's just in a similar camp as It's fine for what it is, even if it's a far, far cry Pink Floyd did one more tour with their last performance While each member pursued the next 10 years were radio silent for but that silence was ended in 2005 when Pink Floyd with which was organized by From all reports, it was a good show. They even hugged at the end, awe. That performance got a for a potential reunion, or new tour, an excitement that Waters and Gilmour very quickly shut down. Aside from what would be their this hiatus was most notable for the losses the band suffered. Syd Barrett passed away in July 2006, and Richard Wright It would seem like after who were crucial in their own unique ways, that this would be the end of Pink Floyd, but four years after Wright's death, David Gilmour and Nick Mason went back into the studio for So remember how I mentioned yielded a lot of music Well, the inspiration for this new project was to take those unreleased songs, rework them, add new parts, and make an album dedicated His own &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; as it were. In fall of 2014, Pink Floyd which was released later To say people were excited for this one would be an understatement. I mean, how could they not be? It was a brand new Pink Floyd album. The first one in 20 years, it would be their last. I think it's great that the band not only got to make a proper but do so while honoring an important, and at times mistreated but with that in mind. (snoring) Gilmour explicitly said this album was not for the iTunes and he's absolutely right. &quot;The Endless River&quot; is comprised with vocals only appearing at the end on lead single &quot;Louder Than Words.&quot; Wait, did they do that on purpose? In a sense, this album to &quot;The Division Bell&quot; to the point where it gets And just like &quot;The Division Bell&quot; this one also just kind of happens, which doesn't mean it's bad, there are certainly moments of beauty, and the entire thing sounds excellent. Nick Mason's drumming shines Gilmour's soloing is technically sound. And it's easy to get swept up &quot;Allons-y (1) and (2)&quot; and the aforementioned but there's no way I would to anyone outside of the Again, I want to stress.

I truly doubt that the will ever perform again, but still, they've given us and even if you're not a fan or the work they put out amidst they did manage to give us four stone-cold classics of their time. If you want to get into Pink Floyd, I'd say start out with &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;Animals.&quot; For a taste of their early days, I would say &quot;Atom Heart And for their later days and &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason.&quot; I'd also recommend &quot;Piper and &quot;The Wall,&quot; but with the qualifiers that the former is radically different from everything that would come after, and the latter is just a very and not the first album And if you have a favorite live performance, or related thing, I would love to know what (upbeat music)
