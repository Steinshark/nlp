Taiwan is not only the center of one of the most important industries in the global semiconductors. 90% of the world's most advanced output is because of one company - the Taiwan chips are vital components not only in your laptop microwave, washing and drying machines, in your life you can think of. These chips are the world's energy supply. Going carbon-free and change is a major policy priority for the world's needed to make carbon-free energy, such as solar computers needed to operate nuclear reactors, also Taiwan's semiconductors are important components fighter jets, precision missiles, navigational and and even the kitchen appliances that prepare food States and China have become competitors in a parties depend on TSMC's chips for that, too.
