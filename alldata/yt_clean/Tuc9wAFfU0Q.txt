&quot;Walnut Colored Autumnal Pasta&quot; I boiled raw walnuts for 2 minutes, soaked them in water, and removed the darker part of the thin brown skin~ I'm going to chop up some onions and garlic~ Coco and Cookie are eating while fighting against sleepiness... lol Autumn colored macaroni pasta~ I'm going to stir fry the onions and garlic that I just chopped~ Cookie is sleeping while his eyes are open Let's add the walnuts now~ Parsley stem Basil leaves Milk of your choice Heavy cream I'm going to simmer it for about 10 mimutes~ The thin skin of the walnuts gave the sauce a peachy color, which is lovely and autumnal Let's blend it with a blender until it becomes nice and creamy :) Saute some shrimp seasoned with garlic powder, salt and pepper with olive oil~ It's a pretty purple color Treasures of the forest meet treasures of the sea Sprinkle as much parmezan cheese as you want, and the walnut shrimp pasta is ready! It has such a gentle, heartwarming taste Delicious! Octagonal window: &quot;Hi!&quot; &quot;New French door and Tile&quot; The DIY tiles that were halfway through in the last video are now complete! The old door became worn out and it took a lot of muscle and exquisite skill to open and close it every time, I am very impressed with how smoothly it opens and closes now The entire kitchen has a rather sweet design, so I chose black-and-white tiles to add an accent to the kitchen~ The air conditioner vent is just right above the floor, so the floor is cool during the summer and warm during the winter :) All my babies love this area, and I am happy for them &quot;Harvesting Peanuts&quot; I planted some peanuts and sweet potato on this hill a while back, but the deers snacked on them when they budded.... I thought I would never be able to harvest any of them because the deers seemed to have particularly eaten off the soft tips where the flowers bloomed :( but.... I actually found some peanuts!! What a pleasant surprise! Charle: &quot;What a churu from heaven~&quot; Ohhh, just like pennies from heaven! It definitely is an unexpected fortune You're good with words, Charlie! Charlie: &quot;hehehe&quot; Nico: &quot;The deers left some for you to have~&quot; You're right, baby I have to thank the deers that kindly shared some with me and the peanuts that worked hard to grow :) Oh, I hear my baby goats crying.... I have to go back home~ I harvested so much &quot;A Joyful Gift&quot; My son's friend has been an audience of my video for a long time, and she sent me a letter and a gift via my son who was temporarily back in Japan The handwritten letter filled with kind words brings tears to my eyes How grateful and happy I am I love giving and receiving gifts Mede: "This paper smells like kindness~&quot; You know what kindness smells like, baby? How nice Mede: &quot;Yeah, I do~&quot; The whole family enjoyed the very delicious baked goods very much Thank you so much for the kindness I hope I can thank her in person next time I return to Japan Nico: &quot;Don't worry, my mom is not scary or creepy~&quot; I'm going to unshell the peanuts~ Nico and Mede: &quot;Is that a snack?&quot; No, these are peanuts :) Here are your snacks! &quot;Making Peanut Butter&quot; Rinse the peeled raw peanuts under running water, pat dry, and place on a baking sheet~ To prevent uneven roasting, arrange the peanuts so that they do not overlap each other Roast in a preheated oven at 180degC for 10 minutes~ Once 10 minutes have elapsed, take it out, mix everything up, and roast for another 10 minutes. I took them out from the oven after another 10 minutes, right before it started to brown up And all I have to do after that is blend it with a food processor I've been blending it for over 30 minutes, so the food processor is starting to heat up Since it's pretty late, I decided to stop here for tonight and let the food processor rest~ Nico: &quot;Good morning-&quot; Both babies are so happy all the time during the morning milk time They fold their front legs and keep their faces low because their mother's breasts are low to the ground~ The way they're so concentrated is just so adorable Now, continuing with the peanut butter making, I can't get it to form a paste, no matter how much I mix it... Let me take back my word saying all I had to do was blend it with a food processor I'll add honey as a last resort.... Whyyyy It's not working :( My fingers and hands can't handle this anymore! It's been two days :( (I'm a bit over exaggerating lol) It's either the human gives up first or the food processor breaks first Why? Why is it not working? How did this happen? My peanut butter!!!!!! I wish we never met, peanut butter.... I'm just gonna lay down now My fingers hurt so bad too I'm just gonna go buy some peanut butter from the store &quot;Healing Sweet Potato&quot; I'm letting the peanut butter rest in the fridge for now My guess is that I needed a bigger food processor with stronger power.... I completely underestimated the whole creation process of peanut butter.... I want to apologize to all peanut butters I encounter The first human being ever that make peanut butter is truly amazing He or she must have had a strong passion for food, because peanuts are delicious just by roasting them in the first place, but he or she decided to grind them for hours until it turned into a liquid! I really admire them! I decided to make some sweet potato to soothe my heart Momo: &quot;Where are the squirrels~&quot; The boys are practicing head butting It's sweet of them that they stop right before their head actually hits hard Sweet potatoes that have been steamed on a bed of fig leaves smell wonderful For each steamed potato, add a spoonful of butter and a tablespoonful of honey Add some cinnamon and butter and blend it with a hand blender~ Now this easily turned into a thick liquid Thank goodness Sprinkle some sesame seeds and bake them in the oven on 180 degC for about 15 minutes~ &quot;Time for a Walk&quot; I usually take a walk around the garden with Nico and Charlie in the evening, and the goats are now able to follow along with us :) At first, I was very afraid that they might eat poisonous plants or garbage, and was always so worried about them.... But, I have to be brave and believe in the strength and wild intuition that they originally possess. Instead of worrying, I should look back, call their name, and praise them :) feel like I am mentally growing up with them too Time to go home, my babies~ Nico: &quot;Okay~&quot; Synchronized pee time &quot;Soaking Wet Bluebell&quot; I went to check on the chicken coop as it was starting to rain, and Bluebell was soaking wet outside the coop :( Maybe she was waiting outside because she was worried about Kimutaku not being there :( (She's in a separate coop since her legs are not in a good condition) Kimutaku and Bluebell are both silkies and grew up together since they were chicks. Silkie feathers do not repel water, so if they get wet, they can easily catch cold After drying her thoroughly with a hair dryer, I decided to have her spend some time together in the infirmary with Kimutaku Kai never gives up scratching the door until it opens kai: &quot;Scratch scratch scratch&quot; &quot;Yayy it's open!&quot; Everyone is enjoying the sound of the rain and relaxing freely Dear friends, thank you so much for visiting my house every time Please warm up with a delicious sweet potato and a cup of milk tea I hope your weekend will be filled with warm smiles and happiness Sugar jar lid: &quot;Hope to see you again!&quot; Charlie: &quot;It's time for bonus clips~&quot; Charlie: &quot;Attack!!&quot; I need multiple laps for my babies... lol Nico rolling nonstop Nico, can I accessorize you with some fallen leaves? Nico: &quot;Sure, I love the smell of leaves~&quot; &quot;Does it look good on me?&quot; It looks wonderful on you, Nico Nico: &quot;Hehe~&quot; Kai, can I accessorize you as well? Kai: &quot;Um, maybe no thank you~&quot; Momo: &quot;Squirrels?&quot; &quot;No squirrels :(&quot; Nico and Charlie: &quot;Bye everyone~&quot;
