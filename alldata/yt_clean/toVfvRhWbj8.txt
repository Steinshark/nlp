- This is a carburetor and see-through carburetor. And this is a high-speed You see where this is going. If you've ever cranked some with a small engine on it, you have interacted at some The question is, what does Yes, it mixes air and fuel together. But how? Like, I want to understand how it works. As a mechanical engineer, I thought I had an understanding day I went to visit my dad who was replacing a My dad is a really good teacher understanding of how So I decided to suspend carburetors and just ask him Teach me. What followed was a 45 about carburetors. - That's the main jet carburetor. See the holes on the side. Bowl, you got gasoline in there. - Uh-huh. - Float. See the needle going up - Yes, sir. - That's the throttle right Choke. We running open right there. Suction. The intake when the cylinder goes down. - It's a vacuum. - It sucks air through here. Put your finger up there, and the vacuum will pull this right open. The valve closes in the cylinder, the compression stroke comes up and compresses the gasoline. The spark plug fires, (engine turning) That's smooth. Works well. - So my dad gave me a masterclass What I'm going to do is try what he taught me. And then we'll move on to where I think you can understand So most carburetors are either So let's look at this aluminum here. Most carburetors have some Like you've got some kind On this side, you've got And down here, if you take off the bottom, you can see that there's bottom and a little thing All this looks kind of normal. Like if you've ever looked at an engine, you've seen stuff that looks like this. The thermoplastic version So what I want to draw your components to a carburetor. And the bottom part, and the And the bottom part is called the Bowl. So in order to understand this, I tried to figure out if carburetor and I found Number one, I actually found a see-through carburetor on the internet. The problem is the guy that I wouldn't run gasoline through this. It was for teaching only, So we're not going to run So I was left to try to find other sources for see through carburetors, and I found one on the internet. There's a young man in Pennsylvania. He created this. It's basically a see-through Venturi, which is part of a carburetor, but it didn't quite do what I wanted, which was to show the complete inner workings of the carburetor. So at this point, it's clear, we're going to have to make And remember there's two components of the carburetor, right? Okay. First, let's talk about the Venturi. If you are like me and you have really old books on your shelf, you might have one that explains and explains that a Venturi where you take fluid, that's If you neck it down at cross-sectional area, the static pressure at that point at the throat decreases. Creating kind of like a Well, that can be used to All right. So let's look at that. So the Venturi part of sucking the fuel up into the line. The second part of the carburetor, the Bowl is for holding the fuel. So after a lot of collaboration, conversations and actual We came up with a 3D printed solution for a see-through carburetor. It consists of a laser 3D printed housing, which incorporates both And we removed a float and carburetor made by Briggs and Stratton. We laser cut our front cover that would allow you to And then we 3D printed a out of PLA plastic. So this is the 3D printed On an earlier episode of Smarter Everyday, I described a see-through get see the combustion Basically there's four strokes You have the intake stroke, which is where it's into the cylinder. After that you have which compresses the fuel air mixture. And then you have the which creates the power stroke, and then the valve at the top opens and you push out in the exhaust start the whole thing over again. You have intake, Intake, compression, power, exhaust. The interesting thing is that it is a vacuum. It is And what we can do is we Hang with me. This is a So this is the carburetor and let's assume the engine taking advantage of the fact vacuum and it makes air want to flow this way into the engine. So once air starts flowing this way, what happens is air comes in down into the Venturi there. Like we said, in our book earlier, where flow is high, pressure's low. And so if you have gasoline down here, all full up right here, what you do is you have a like a straw that goes up and goes into the center of the Venturi. And what that does is that liquid that comes up right And then once that happens, it mixes and then it goes downstream into the engine like this. So basically you have you've got the fuel coming up here. And then you have the mixture That's basically what a carburetor does. The choke in the throttle up top. That's the flappy things That's the choke and that's the throttle. Basically what they do is control the mixture If you close off the choke air that goes down into the Venturi, then you can create what's Meaning the mixture that goes to the engine is rich in gasoline. You might want to do that if it's having a hard time firing up. If you want to lean the mixture like this, that means the mixture And there are different But if you have an ideal and you have full throttle, then you're going to have It's going to make the engine So these are the two controls And this is basically the simplest design for a carburetor that can exist. So let's go get dad to show us if we can catch it in slow motion. The first thing we had to do up to the carburetor. [F] Okay, I'm going to open the fuel. Here goes. [D] And it'll just fill up. [F] It should. [D] Ah, it's doing it. [laughs] I don't know why. [F] Didn't you know that's [D] No, I did not know that [F] Well, yeah. [D] I mean it's obvious, now that you do it. Fuel flows in here and when it moves this needle, which presses into the seat and stops the flow of fuel into the Bowl. So you always have the right amount. Now backfiring is an issue. Right? [F] It is an issue. And how about getting this. [D] Ready to go? [F] Yeah. Cause we spilled some [D] So if, if a backfire happens, fire's going to come backwards and we did not pressure [F] Right. [D] So this this could explode and all this gas could be on [F] Hopefully not. [Both laughing] As a matter of fact, open to let whatever vapors [D] Okay. [F] Ready? [D] Yeah. (engine cranking) Oh, I saw some vapor. [F] Did you? [D] On the intake stroke. Yeah. We're going to see it. Aah, it's running. Okay I triggered We can kill it. [F] Kill it? [D] Kill it, yeah. You can see the vapor in the intake. [F] Can you? [D] Yeah you can. Did you see it? [D] No. [D] What do you mean you didn't see that. [F] I'm looking for fire. [Both laughing] Okay. Did you catch it? [D] I don't know. I think, [F] It was running rich. It's So I open the choke up so and it started running smooth. [D] Like it. Like, it was [F] Well yeah, that's the way I didn't know there'd be [Destin smacks his Dad] [D] Oh, look at that! [F] Look at that! [D] You see it? [F] Yep. [rapid firing sounds each time you see [instrumental music] [The fluid rushing through the chamber in slow motion] [F] You can see air, air-fuel mixture going in the combustion chamber. [D] This is intake. [F] No intake is... [D] Is when it's sucking in. [F] Right. [D] Intake. [F] Yeah. [D] Fire. [F] Intake valve closes. [D] Closes exhaust stroke. [F] Yes. [Both] Another intake. [F] Right. [D] So can you run two cylinders off of one carburetor? [F]Oh yeah, yeah. Or three or four. Yeah. [D] Really? [F] Yeah. [D] Okay. [F] The carburetor, all it does you got one carburetor [D] Are you serious? [F] Yeah. [D] So it's running [F] Each cylinder sucks in Sucks in only what it can use. [D] Volumetrically. [F] Right. Now my motorcycle has a and you have to balance those. [D] Because if you have one, one that's hitting harder - Right. It won't run smooth at all. [D] So the advantage of running multiple cylinders is you get the same [F] Yes. [D] You can see the Do you see that? [F] You can? Oh, it is. It is. Turbulent flow is a vor, [D] Yeah, absolutely. You're just trying to get me riled up, cause you know, Derek [F] Yeah. I like Derek. [D] I like Derek too. would you change on What would you change? [F] I would make so that when you put them in position, they would hold themselves. [D] Okay. [F] The engine sucks [D] Oh does it? [F] It does. run away. If you don't physically restrain it, it gets faster and faster and faster. [D] Really? [F] There's no governor. Yes. It's trying to pull that open that it does not because [D] Run away. [F] Right. [F] You feel how [D]Yes. [F] It's difficult to move on purpose. [D] I understand carburetors now. [F] Better? [D] Way better. Yeah. I mean, I guess nobody understands it. [F] Well I couldn't do what I wanted to do. I could not make it run because position, but man, it works. [D] So when you just went wide [F] Well, I didn't want it to run away. [D] Try it. We got a fire extinguisher. - Well you got centrifugal forces. You tear the engine up. You've got governors. You got throttles. You got control in a that we don't have here. You could get, you could. [D] I could get hurt. [F] We could tear the engine all to pieces. [D] Okay. [F] By supplying more, it'll run faster than it's designed to run. Can you zoom into that? [D] Yes sir. I can. I can get a tighter lens so the fuel come up into the Venturi and then we can it vaporize. [F] And get blown away. Get blown away. [D] You wanna do that? [F] Yeah. [D] Let's run it steady state as fast as you're comfortable. [F] I'll try to, but I can't. I'm going to have to put I think it'll just start right now without a choke. [D] With a finger or fenger? [F] A fenger. [Destin laughs] [engine running] [F] Okay? [D] Got it. [engine sputtering] [Engine stops] [D] Almost kill it. [F] That's a good carburetor. [instrumental music] [Loud wind rushing sounds [D] So the fuel is That's the main jet, right? [F] Where's that [D] Yes. It's coming of Venturi and then the intake blows [F] Air. [D] blows air across it. Look at all the stuff dancing down there. Let's run it again, and just look at the top I just want to see what that looks like. (engine starting up) The mechanical oscillations expected. [F] The engine is running Each time you see a shake [D] No, I don't think so. [F] You don't? [D] I think it's a vibration [F] You think it's a tuning fork? [D] I do. [F] There should be four. Should be intake, compression. [D] Power stroke. [F] Power stroke, exhausts. [D] Yes. [F] So should have four strokes for each. And you do have, if you're 1, 2, 3 suck. 1, 2, 3 suck. 1, 2, 3 suck. Top dead center and bottom dead center. [D] You're pretty smart for a redneck. [F] Well, that's why they call it four stroke. [both laughing] [D] Okay. So now we on a macro level. We have built a functioning But now what we need to do is Like what happens when that jet intake comes over the top of it? What does that look like? [engine running] [D] Got it. Ooh. [Laughing] Yeah, I know. [Instrumental music] [F] It's suspended. A drop of fuel was suspended in the air and then suction comes Derek is gonna to love that. [Both laughing] [D] Because of turbulence. [F] Yes. There's change in the laminar Ooh. [D] Converging diverging, nozzle. It. So a carburetor is It's a rocket nozzle. Is what it is. I mean you're speeding up. [F] Watch it. Oh, oh, oh, oh. [D] It's a little drop and [F] Yeah. Carburetor tries to do is molecular level. Right? [D] What do you mean? [F] In order to get full you need all the surface area [D] Because ideally right next to a fuel molecule. So now I'm going to get you pull the rope for the first time, when there's no fuel in the I'm gonna see what that looks like. [Engine running] [D] Got it. [Engine sputtering] [F] Getting some air from somewhere. [D] It's fun that we almost There's a little bit of risk. [F] Perpetual motion machine. [Both laughing] [D] Oh, look at this. [F] What? [D]So on the intake How cool is that? You can see the rope in the foreground and you see the carburetor. I could not have imagined [F] Oh wow. [D] Yeah. [F] Pam, Pam, Pam. [D] Time to a time to mill those out of aluminum, I think. That's PLA, so I bet that PLA [F] By the gasoline. Because it wasn't that [D] You can see in the straw and the jet. Look at that. You can see, [F] You can. [D] See that the flow right there. You can see everything. For the next shot. We wanted to see if we could shoot the high speed down the throat of the Venturi. So Trenton jumped in to help because we needed more hands. Just pop the choke out. And then we're just gonna [F] I'll pop the or at least half of it. Yeah. [D] All right. So that's going to lean our mixture, right? [F] Yep. [D] Are you pulling focus? [T] I'm going to have to once it's running. [D] Yeah. [Engine running] [F] You're going to [D] Yeah. So I'll meter it with my finger Throttle is wide open right now, but it shuts off automatically. So if you'll grab it and shove will keep it there. [F] That way? [D] Keep it there, yeah. [Engine running at high speed] [D] I can literally [Laughs] [T] Come on. [D] Yeah. Okay, hold on. [T] I can't focus [D] Ready? [T] Yup. [Engine running louder/faster] [T] Okay. [D] Did you get it? [T] I think so. [Engine sputtering] [D] Die engine! I don't want you to have Oh my goodness. [F] There's your [D] I saw the vapor. [F] There's your vapor right there. [T] Got it. [D] Where? Coming out? [F] No, in the intake manifold. [D] Oh yeah. Whoa that's, that's vapor. [F] Yep. [D] Okay. So [F] Vapor go away. - What just happened, is dad cranked it I covered, I choked it with my hand. He was operating throttle. For a second there we [F] Yeah, we were insane. (laughing) [D] So I was running choke. Trent was trying to frame the shot. OhHHHHHHHH!! hohoho I just hit your mic. It flattens the dropout. [F] It does, it does. [D] It flattens the dropout [Instrumental music] Look at it! [Instrumental music continues] [Gunshot in slow motion [D] I now have a of how a carburetor intake air interacts with fuel [F] That was worth it. [D] This journey started by simply asking my dad how carburetors work. And by taking the time to we learned that the design yet very complex. And the fluid dynamics at [Instrumental music] So I know a lot of times when of a video, people kind They're like, oh, I'm But I want to tell you why particular sponsor for When I look at a complicated that's a very difficult So one thing I like to do is I and understand what's going variables and getting to fundamental understanding of the concepts.
