THE SOLD AS A &quot;DREAMLINER&quot;. Jim McNerney: A once in a decade if not once FOR AIRLINES IT'S CHEAP TO FLY. FOR PASSENGERS IT OFFERS UNPARALLELED &quot;wow&quot; FOR BOEING IT PROMISED WINDFALL PROFITS. PRESIDENT OBAMA: The Dreamliner is the plane BUT AL JAZEERA DISCOVERS A DARK SIDE TO THE STAN SORSCHER: unimaginable that we could have fires on the airplane. OUR INVESTIGATION FINDS BOEING ALTERED ITS COLE: They're shortchanging the engineering WE UNCOVER A WHISTLEBLOWER FIRED AS HE FOUGHT WOODS: There's no doubt there are bad repairs WE GO BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, ONTO THE FACTORY UC WORKER VIDEO: I wouldn't fly on one of Because I see the quality of the fu**ing sh*t around here. TITLE: &quot;BROKEN DREAMS: THE BOEING 787&quot; TAKAMATSU, JAPAN - A BRAND-NEW BOEING 787 PASSENGERS KNEW THE PLANE WAS IN TROUBLE: and saw white smoke. That's when I realised the danger. KEN'ICHI KAWAMURA/passenger: The burning plastic / I thought we were going to crash. TAKEUCHI KOJI/Fireman: On closer inspection, size. THE BLUE BOX WAS ONE OF THE DREAMLINER'S TWO - AND RISKY - EVER PERMITTED ON A COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. Newsreader: It's just the latest in a string art aircraft. NINE DAYS EARLIER A DREAMLINER BATTERY HAD TWO BATTERY FAILURES IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS. NEWS BITE: Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways of Boeing 787 Dreamliners. JAPAN AIRLINES AND ANA HAD BEEN THE FIRST FIRST TO CANCEL ALL FLIGHTS. NEWS BITE: Breaking news. The United States Federal Aviation... WITHIN 24 HOURS, THE U.S. SAFETY REGULATOR, THE 787. NEWS BITE: All 50 of the new Boeing 787 Dreamliners THE REST OF THE WORLD FOLLOWED. NO BOEING FLEET HAD EVER BEEN FORCED FROM BUT ON JANUARY 17, 2013, THE DREAM WAS OVER. I'M WILL JORDAN. FOR A YEAR, MY TEAM AND I HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING IT'S THE BOEING COMPANY'S BIG BET ON THE FUTURE... A PLANE CREATED TO SAVE FUEL, IMPROVE COMFORT, AND ONE BUILT IN A NEW WAY - DESIGNED AND THE GLOBE. THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THE BATTERY IS GS YUASA, WE WANTED THEM TO TELL US WHAT HAD GONE SO SOUND: Security Guard in Japanese. Will: Al Jazeera. Guard: Al Jazeera. We wonder whether you might be able to do an interview? THEY REFUSED. SPOKESWOMAN: We have a contract with Boeing you. THE BATTERY IS ONLY ONE PART OF THE DREAMLINER'S THERE'S ALSO A CHARGER, MADE AT A FACTORY WHAT HAPPENED THERE, SHOWS BOEING LEARNT YEARS COULD BE. IN TUCSON, ARIZONA, WE TRACKED DOWN MICHAEL MICHAEL LEON / Former Securaplane technician: 17 years old, and I joined the paratroopers and I was assigned to an LEON: this is the first time I've been here It's hard to believe that this is what's left three story engineering structure. ON A NOVEMBER MORNING IN 2006, LEON AND DOZENS - THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THE BATTERY CHARGER. LEON: I started a pot of coffee then I went charging unit. AND THEN IT HAPPENED. LEON: ...and there was a very loud explosion and there it was coming out the side of this battery. It was about that big, and it wasn't like It looked like a jet afterburner, like jet exhaust. THE PROTOTYPE BATTERY SECURAPLANE WAS USING KIRK WINES / Former Securaplane technician: bangs. A kind of shhhhhh. And just this jet of steam. LEON: The fire was literally rolling up the could just see it eating up all around me... WINES: I know if that had happened on board of survival. IT WAS THE BIGGEST CHEMICAL FIRE IN TUCSON'S A TEN THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT, THREE-STOREY STRUCTURE, RICHARD LUKSO / Securaplane founder: ...after very emphatically the danger of this chemistry. RICHARD LUKSO KNOWS WELL THE CHEMISTRY OF BOEING CHOSE THE MOST POWERFUL THERE IS... BUT ALSO THE MOST VOLATILE. LUKSO: here as far as danger. LUKSO STEPPED DOWN AS SECURAPLANE PRESIDENT HE STARTED A NEW COMPANY TO MAKE LITHIUM ION LUKSO WAS A TRUE BELIEVER IN THE TECHNOLOGY. THEN HE BEGAN TESTING. BULLET TEST VIDEO: Two, 3.3 amp hour series LUKSO WENT BEYOND EVEN THE LATEST INDUSTRY INTO BATTERIES, TO SEE IF THEY COULD BE MADE SAFE FOR MILITARY APPLICATIONS. (BATTERY WALK/TALK) LUKSO: Yeah. You could run the test that you feel that be safe, but you also need to have a conscience extreme.&quot; IN THE END, TESTING WITH A CONSCIENCE, LUKSO HIS NEW COMPANY FAILED. LUKSO: ...we became proficient in destroying And, and the more we learned about it, the I mean, oh, my God, we kept digging and digging. We were saying I wonder what the rest of the Well, I guess we knew. BY REST OF THE GUYS HE MEANS BOEING. AND THEY WERE TESTING TO A WEAKER STANDARD... ONE WRITTEN BY THE FAA SPECIFICALLY FOR THE IT'S THE FAA'S JOB TO REGULATE AIR SAFETY. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING AIRPLANES, THE TO THE AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS. WHEN IT COMES TO THE BATTERY AND BEYOND, BOEING THE BATTERIES PASSED BOEING'S TESTS. IN LINE WITH THE FAA RULES, BOEING SAID THE FIRE ON BOARD AN AIRCRAFT. THEN, THEY FAILED TWICE IN JUST NINE DAYS. BOEING HAS NOT UNCOVERED THE ROOT CAUSE OF IT FOUND A WORK AROUND: A STRONG STEEL CASE, FUMES. SINNETT: ...any fire will be impossible because BUT SEVERAL LEADING SCIENTISTS HAVE THEIR DONALD SADOWAY / MIT: I don't think it's a with all of its fortifications, all of the elements are still DESPITE NOT KNOWING THE ROOT CAUSE, AMERICA'S AND IN APRIL 2013, THE DREAMLINER WAS BACK. BUT THIS STORY GOES FAR BEYOND A BURNING BATTERY. IT BEGINS AT BOEING ITSELF. &quot;This is it. The first American commercial jet capable The Boeing 707 jet clipper. SINCE ITS CREATION IN SEATTLE NEARLY A CENTURY A WORLD-CLASS ENGINEERING COMPANY. BUT IN 1997 BOEING CHANGED. IT MERGED WITH COMPETITOR, MCDONNELL DOUGLAS. TWO COMPANIES WITH TWO VERY DIFFERENT BUSINESS STAN SORSCHER / Former Boeing engineer: the culture and business model into the same business model that McDonnell ABW-002 / 1:05 you stop doing aggressive new product developments; business for cash. THE NEW BOEING MOVED ITS HEADQUARTERS FROM KNOWN, TO CHICAGO. IT BEGAN SLASHING INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH, RETURNS. CYNTHIA COLE / Former Boeing engineer: I felt the company in the wrong direction and I thought that quality would suffer. KEVIN SANDERS / Former Boeing manager: I feel competence has been hijacked by a bunch of corporate thugs. BY 2003, IT WAS TIME TO LAUNCH A NEW PLANE. BUT BOEING'S NEW BOARD WAS RELUCTANT TO INVEST DOMINIC GATES / Seattle Times: The board made for less money. They wanted it made for $5 billion and they wanted ABW-002/ 9:35 So how do you make that happen? Well, you promise them that you can do it less / and then worry about the consequences BOEING CAME UP WITH A PLAN TO SAVE ITSELF IT WOULD PUSH THE COSTS ONTO ITS MAJOR SUPPLIERS. BOEING WOULD CALL THEM PARTNERS - AND THEY BOEING'S JOB WOULD BE TO ASSEMBLE THE PLANE. GATES: It was almost as if at times you thought could sit in Chicago and have / other companies / do things, and by putting it all together and putting a Boeing sticker on it at the RIGHT ON SCHEDULE, BOEING ROLLED OUT THE DREAMLINER Tom Brokaw: Airlines with us today have made So far they have ordered 677 of them. ABOULAFIA: I think in a lot of ways, July I've seen in the industry... Brokaw: Watching us live around the world, languages for the premier of this very exciting Boeing 787 Dreamliner. GATES: We were all inside the factory with huge screens... Then they opened the doors of this giant assembly bay... ABOULAFIA: And in rolls this beautiful, beautiful GATES: And there it is, sitting in the sun it and none of us noticed. Smile! ABOULAFIA: And I'm reassured by the executives months. One, two, three. JON OSTROWER / Wall Street Journal you could look up in the wheel well and you GATES: We learned that the whole thing was MIKE BAIR / 787 Program Manager: Beautiful Absolutely beautiful... GATES: They rolled out this fake airplane. OSTROWER: I realized the doors were made of GATES: This plane that we were admiring was JAMES MCNERNEY / BOEING CEO: None of this leadership. ABOULAFIA: There's only two conclusions you either lying, in which case they are completely clueless because or you have a complete disconnect between the people who are working who are saying this. MCNERNEY: And so to each and every member congratulations, and keep up the great work.' SANDERS: More than any other single event that the Boeing Company is now all about the big lie. THE DAY AFTER THE ROLLOUT, WALL STREET PUSHED BUT IT WAS ALL ABOUT TO UNRAVEL, AS REVEALED Hello and welcome to our quarterly update SEPTEMBER 2007: BOEING ANNOUNCES ITS FIRST MIKE BAIR: It's not a failure in how the airplane It's just a really complicated puzzle.&quot; OCTOBER 2007: THE THREE-MONTH DELAY BECOMES JIM MCNERNEY: We wish we didn't have to do New kinds of innovation present challenges best to meet them. OCTOBER 2009: SIX MONTHS BECOMES TWO YEARS JIM MCNERNEY: We know that we can and must And I'm confident that despite our setbacks 787 through the flight test program and into GATES: It just kept getting worse and worse You have to understand, this was unprecedented. There had never been a Boeing delay in a Boeing ABOULAFIA: The sequence of events looked an a manageable series of delays. THE DREAMLINER BUSINESS STRATEGY WAS BACKFIRING. DESIGNED TO SAVE SO MUCH MONEY, IT WAS COSTING GATES: The outsourcing plan failed very badly. / All these different suppliers who were going major sections couldn't actually do it. TO FIX THE DREAMLINER, BOEING DISPATCHED HUNDREDS AROUND THE GLOBE INCLUDING TO ITS PARTNER ALENIA - IN SOUTHERN Riccardo Busca / Alenia plant manager: We the process. ALENIA WOULD TAKE ON THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING PANELS... BUT WITH COMPOSITE PLASTIC BARRELS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE: TO LOSE WEIGHT, SAVING BUT NO ONE HAD EVER MADE ANYTHING LIKE THIS Busca: There is nothing comparable with that Will: there's nothing built like this. BOEING'S QUALITY INSPECTORS HAVE ONE OVERRIDING IN 2009, WHEN INSPECTORS FOUND FLAWS IN PARTS TO STOP. A YEAR LATER, IN ALENIA'S OTHER FACTORY THEY ORDERED WORK TO STOP. BUT THIS TIME, MANAGERS OVERRULED THE QUALITY THIS INTERNAL BOEING DOCUMENT, FROM 2010, WITH FABRICATION... WITHOUT DELAY.&quot; DONATO AMOROSO / ALENIA COO: We followed at help of a Boeing specialist at the time and while we were in the disapproved the quality and we will continue to work in engineering at IN THIS SEPARATE MEMO, OBTAINED BY AL JAZEERA, TO THE PREFERRED QUALITY PROCESS&quot;. WE RECEIVED THE MEMOS FROM AN ENGINEER WHO, ON CAMERA. SO HE ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS BY EMAIL. SOURCE: They changed basic engineering principles We all protested. ...Would you fly on a plane that you knew THE QUALITY ENGINEER TOLD US DEVIATING FROM ALENIA AND BOEING SAID IT DID NOT. CYNTHIA COLE: 6,7,8,9,10... SO I BROUGHT THE MEMO TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT Cynthia Cole: So My name is Cynthia Cole, Last name is C-o-l-e. CYNTHIA COLE SPENT 32 YEARS AT THE COMPANY SHE HAD NEVER SEEN THIS MEMO BEFORE. COLE: The program schedule may require deviation See? That one sentence right there, that one fragment of the sentence / You know, schedule. You make quality happen in the schedule. // They're shortchanging the engineering process allowing quality control to do their job and to be. // I don't see how these people who write these things and agree down here, how they sleep at night. I just don't get it. How can you do that? // As an engineer I find that reprehensible. Male Voice: How does it make you feel as a Oh, yeah. I'm not flying on a 787. That just makes, you know... Because I've been kind of avoiding flying and seeing this, I would definitely avoid TEASE: IN PART TWO - INSIDE A BOEING 787 PLANE THEY BUILD. IF THE DREAMLINER REPRESENTS BOEING'S FUTURE, WILL BE BUILT. IN THIS ASSEMBLY PLANT IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH I'VE BEEN CALLED TO A MEETING WITH A MAN WHO HE'S TAKING A HUGE RISK EVEN TALKING TO ME. SOURCE: It's been eating me alive to know to say anything. AT HIS REQUEST, WE USED A DIFFERENT VOICE. SOURCE: 300 souls on the plane / their lives WE HAD SEEN REPORTS OF BAD WORKMANSHIP IN BUT THE MAN CLAIMED THE PROBLEMS GO FAR DEEPER. SOURCE: With all the problems reported on swept away...hushed up. / It's an iceberg. SOURCE: The people that actually work on it // there is / an uneducated, under-skilled and uncaring staff that are building these that way. AND HE WAS PREPARED TO PROVE IT, WEARING A WORKERS SAID ABOUT THE DREAMLINER. UC PLANT WORKER 1: ... They hire these people Working, fucking flipping burgers for a living making sandwiches at subway... SOURCE: You can't have somebody from McDonald's / That's trusting somebody with your life. That's what we're doing here. UC PLANT WORKER 2: The thing about it is, something together and putting it together right. Because if this fucker breaks, it can't come SOURCE: I've seen a lot of things that should / people talking about doing drugs, looking for drugs... UC PLANT WORKER 3: It's all coke and, um, You can get weed here, you can get some really good weed here. SOURCE: Really, like in the plant? WORKER 3: Yeah. SOURCE: Like there's somebody who has it right I could walk up to them and just... WORKER 3: No, I don't know if they have it You've got to place your order. SOURCE: You gotta place your order. SOURCE: I have never seen anybody or heard As far as I know random drugs tests just don't happen. UC PLANT WORKER 2: they don't drug test nobody. SOURCE: I know they don't. WORKER 2: There's people that go out there SOURCE: Do they? WORKER 2: Hell yea. SOURCE: You know for a fact. WORKER 2: Hell yeah. WHEN BOEING FIRST ANNOUNCED THE 787, BACK BEEN ASSEMBLED ANYWHERE BUT WASHINGTON STATE. THE ONE PLACE BOEING HAD ALWAYS MADE ITS COMMERCIAL BUT NEW BOEING WAS PLAYING BY NEW RULES. SO IT DID SOMETHING IT HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE BIDDER. DOMINIC GATES: They were going to hold a competition / A state against state, nationwide competition, where to build this plane. I ran to my editor after I put the phone down, not going to believe this. They're not necessarily going to build it WASHINGTON STATE WON, BUT ONLY BY GIVING BOEING IN TAX BREAKS. Union Power! Union Power! Union Power!&quot; FIVE YEARS LATER, BOEING'S MACHINISTS WALKED THE STRIKE COST BOEING BILLIONS AND ADDED BOEING STOCK WAS IN A FREEFALL, AMID A GLOBAL GATES: ... that strike / really enraged the And so / early in 2009 they made it very clear that they wanted a second assembly line THAT TURNED OUT TO BE SOUTH CAROLINA. THE STATE OFFERED CHEAP LAND AND LABOR ... CLOSE AND NO UNIONS. GATES: The decision to build the second 787 was made because of the strike in 2008. / They wanted to do it there because they SORSCHER: It kind of has a shameless feel It's very manipulative and not very hometown. That's not the way you treat your people in your community, you see them as a source of gains to be extracted. BUT FOR BOEING, LEAVING BEHIND A WORLD-CLASS NON-UNION CHARLESTON WOULD COME AT A PRICE. WORK IN THE PLANT IS SIGNIFICANTLY BEHIND Repair worker: I seen some crazy stuff, ya shit out of em to get em to go in the hole. SOURCE: I know of one customer / They'll no quality issues. They will only accept final assembly done in Everett, SOURCE: Everyday when you go to work, not at the previous job to see if someone has messed something else up UC PLANT WORKER 4: That machine malfunctioned Fucked those holes up. And they just went ahead and filled them. And I've gone ahead and told managers about Nothing. TO BE SURE EVERYTHING IS DONE CORRECTLY AND INSPECTORS PAINSTAKINGLY CHECK EVERY STEP OF THE WORK. BUT IN SOUTH CAROLINA, THIS INSPECTOR SAYS UC PLANT WORKER 5: Here you will do the whole You know and I'm supposed to verify that oh, you checked the hole, you did the sealant, I never saw all that. But I'm supposed to final it and say that it's good. That's one of the problems I have. SOURCE: you think Everett's better? UC PLANT WORKER 2: I think Everett will do of the union, they have to. / Here everybody is being pushed to meet this Will: which do you think is the priority then, SOURCE: Schedule. IF IT'S A CONSTANT BATTLE BETWEEN QUALITY OF KILOMETERS FROM SOUTH CAROLINA -- IN MISSISSIPPI. JOHN WOODS / Former Boeing engineer: My name I worked for General Electric, Lockheed, Boeing. JOHN WOODS SPENT A CAREER IN THE HIGHLY SPECIALIZED BOEING HIRED WOODS KNOWING HE HAD QUALIFIED DISORDER, OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER, AND MILD DEPRESSION. HIS JOB WAS TO WRITE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO PROCESS. WOODS: It's my job to make sure that that WOODS SAYS WHEN HE TRIED TO ENFORCE QUALITY BERATED BY HIS BOSSES. WOODS: In a couple of meetings, there were me to dumb down my work instruction. // saying, you have to remove requirements It's going to take too much time. WOODS SAYS HE WITNESSED DAMAGED PARTS BEING WOODS: There's no doubt there are bad repairs I am worried that sooner or later, there's going to be a structural WOODS APPEALED TO BOEING'S HUMAN RESOURCES FOR DOING HIS JOB. INSTEAD OF COMING TO HIS DEFENSE, BOEING MANAGERS WEEKS LATER, THEY FIRED HIM. WOODS: I'll never forget this. The day before I was terminated, I was telling working at Boeing. It's true. WOODS: So instead of saying thanks for doing what I was supposed to be doing. / I had to leave in shame really. I was embarrassed for my own family. HE STILL HAD NOT LOST FAITH IN THE SYSTEM. HE TURNED TO THE FAA - FILING A WHISTLEBLOWER THE DOCUMENT ALLEGED SEVEN SERIOUS VIOLATIONS MARY SCHIAVO / Former Inspector General, USDOT: their conclusions and their discussion and what they found is, they could not substantiate and the one that they could substantiate, Boeing said, &quot;Okay, we fixed it.&quot; And then they closed the investigation. That's pretty much how they all go. I've seen this so many times. Woods in coffee shop: &quot;thank you&quot; me, they call me up with information and they this information about this dangerous situation. Should I blow the whistle?&quot; I said, &quot;Well, you know, not unless you have a private trust fund or another job a living.&quot; WOODS: I had to maximize all my credit cards There was a lot less money for the kids, for college and everything else. / It shouldn't be this hard to do the right WHEN WE LOOKED AT WOODS' FAA COMPLAINT, WE HE WAS THE FAA'S MAN IN CHARGE OF THE DREAMLINER. IN 2011, THREE YEARS BEHIND SCHEDULE, BOEING AND IT WAS BAHRAMI WHO SIGNED THE ORDER. Fancher at Certification Party: &quot;Thanks also the FAA's transport airplane directive. Ali ...&quot; BATTERIES. AND AFTER TWO FAILED AND THE FAA GROUNDED IT BACK INTO THE AIR. SHORTLY AFTER THAT HE RETIRED FROM THE FAA. TWO WEEKS LATER BAHRAMI WAS HIRED AS VICE-PRESIDENT LOBBIES ON BEHALF OF BOEING. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE DID WAS TO APPEAR FOR COMPANIES LIKE BOEING. Ali Bahrami / Congressional hearing: 'We not only to take full advantage of industry expertise, but to increase MR. BAHRAMI DECLINED OUR INTERVIEW REQUEST. SCHIAVO: One day you're regulating the airline // that you're regulating because you'll never leave. The regulators at the FAA will rarely cross They simply won't. IT'S THE WASHINGTON INFLUENCE GAME - AND BOEING LAST YEAR, THE COMPANY HAD OVER 100 REGISTERED WORKERS. THREE WERE FORMER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. BOEING CHIEF EXECUTIVE JIM MCNERNEY IS CHAIRMAN THE PRESIDENT'S FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF CAME SECRETARY. AS SECRETARY OF STATE, HILLARY CLINTON HELPED PLANES TO A RUSSIAN AIRLINE. EVEN PRESIDENT OBAMA BOASTS THAT HE WORKS OBAMA AT BOEING EVENT: &quot;So I tease 'J' ever I say, &quot;I deserve a gold watch because I'm stuff all the time.&quot; &quot;J&quot; IS JIM MCNERNEY. IT'S CLEAR WHAT BOEING GETS FROM THE U.S. WHAT'S NOT SO CLEAR IS WHAT IT GIVES BACK. SCOTT KLINGER / Think tank analyst: Boeing / That's not a unique year. Over the last 12 years, they claimed over they reported $43 billion in U.S. profits. 43 BILLION DOLLARS IN PROFIT. BUT NONE OF THAT COMES FROM THE DREAMLINER, FROM MAKING MONEY. ALL OF BOEING'S COMMERCIAL PROFIT COMES FROM THE DREAMLINER, PRIOR TO JIM MCNERNEY, AND PRIOR TO THE MERGER. IT HAS BEEN THE TOP EXECUTIVES AND LARGEST KLINGER: Boeing's CEO, Jim McNerney, made That was enough to pay the salaries of the president of the United States, the vice president, Court justices, the seven joint chiefs of staff, and all 100 MCNERNEY IS SET TO RETIRE WITH A PENSION OF JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS 2013, BOEING DEMANDED SHANNON RYKER / Boeing machinist: For Jim a quarter of a million dollars per month and think that it's is outrageous. It's absolutely outrageous. BACK IN SOUTH CAROLINA, OUR UNAUTHORIZED TOUR CLOSE. THERE'S ONLY ONE QUESTION LEFT TO ASK. SOURCE: Would you fly on one? WORKER: um... no. SOURCE: You won't fly on one? WORKER: Noooooo WORKER: I've thought about it? I thought about it... no not really f**kers? WORKER: Probably not. SOURCE: Would you fly on one of these? WORKER: Yeah it's sketchy. SOURCE: Sketchy? Yeah I probably would, but I kind of have (laugh) IF THEY'D FLY ON THE DREAMLINER. TEN SAID NO. UC WORKER 2: I wouldn't fly on one of these SOURCE: You wouldn't? Why wouldn't you? WORKER 2: Huh? SOURCE: Why wouldn't ya? WORKER 2: Because I see the quality of the &quot;Hi Mr. Loftis, Will Jordan&quot; &quot;Will Jordan&quot; QUALITY PROCESS APPARENTLY LOOSENED TO SPEED WORKERS FIRED AFTER MAKING SAFETY ALLEGATIONS... WE NEEDED ANSWERS FROM BOEING. Larry Loftis: Right now we're at a very exciting rate up to 10 airplanes a month, faster than any airplane of any wide-body airplane in aviation history. Will Jordan: There's a couple of documents I SHOWED HIM THE DOCUMENTS SUGGESTING BOEING INSPECTORS TO SPEED UP PRODUCTION. MR LOFTIS WAS NOT MANAGER OF THE 787 PROGRAMME Larry Loftis: OK I am not familiar with this Will Jordan: Former Boeing engineers have putting schedule ahead of quality. Short-changing the engineering process to Is that something you recognize? Larry Loftis: The number one focus that we airworthiness of an airplane, the integrity of the airplane and Will Jordan: We've also heard directly from They paint a grim picture really of things there. They say the workforce isn't up to the job. Larry Loftis: I'm extremely confident in the Will Jordan: The Boeing workers at South Carolina Here's what some of them said. ... I'm gonna just call a halt here for a second. Can you turn the camera off for a secon? Cameraman: Why would we need to turn the camera What's the problem? AND THEN, BOEING'S COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR Paul Lewis: So who are these employees that are making these points? Will Jordan: I can't, Obviously I can't tell Boeing workers who assemble the planes that you build. Paul Lewis: Well I'm not sure it's appropriate Will Jordan: Well I'm assuming the buck stops and so the most senior managers are the ones to answer this. We're here with the head of the 787 programme. / And we have these things that you need to hear and you need Paul Lewis: We have not had a chance to review Paul Lewis: Larry, Larry, can you step out Larry: OK but, as I do. I have the highest degree of confidence in employees we have at the Boeing company and Thanks. BOEING ANSWERED OUR QUESTIONS IN WRITING, IT SAID OUR INTERVIEW WAS HOSTILE, UNPROFESSIONAL TELEVISION NEWS. THE COMPANY SAID IT WAS CONFIDENT THAT ITS BOEING SAYS IT USES ONE, COMMON, FAA-APPROVED CHARLESTON. BOEING NOTED ITS MEMO STATED IT DID NOT SIGNIFY QUALITY REQUIREMENTS. BOEING SAID IT DRUG TESTS IN LINE WITH COMPANY THE COMPANY DENIES ANY CUSTOMER HAS SAID THEY AS FOR JOHN WOODS, BOEING SAYS HIS SAFETY TORONTO. MAY 18, 2014. AIR CANADA CELEBRATES THE DELIVERY OF ITS THIS IS THE MODERN MARKETING REALITY OF THE AIR CANADA EXEC: Today represents a huge milestone We've been waiting a long time for this airplane. It's going to allow us to grow in unprecedented PASSENGER: Because when you were eating before FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Well I think our passengers the new amenities. PASSENGER: I just wanna see how for it goes PASSENGER: The windows are huge. FLIGHT ATTENDANT: We are just excited because REPORTER: Is there anything else you wanna AIR CANADA PILOT: Uh, no we're very, very REPORTER: From a seating point of view how REPORTER: Are there more restrooms? BUT IS THERE ANOTHER REALITY? ONE REVEALED BY A BURNING BATTERY. BY THE WORDS OF THE WORKERS WHO BUILD THE UC WORKER: We're not building them to fly, You know what I'm saying? BY BOEING'S APPARENT CHANGES TO ITS OWN QUALITY BOEING SAYS THE 787 HAS NO MORE PROBLEMS THAN THE FAA SAYS THERE'S NEVER BEEN A SAFER TIME THE DREAMLINER IS THE FASTEST-SELLING PLANE ONE DAY WE MAY ALL FIND OURSELVES ON BOARD. WHEN WE DO, WE WILL TRUST BOEING HAS PUT QUALITY WE WILL TRUST THE REGULATORS HAVE BEEN RIGOROUS;
