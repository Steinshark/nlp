When an attempt to imitate Yi Peng turns into a disaster in the middle of the temple Khmer version of sky lanterns No matter how you look at it, it's copying the Lanna Yi Peng tradition. to find carved images from Angkor Wat to quote But from the scattered fireballs, the monk's robes were barely visible. It can be clearly pointed out that it is undeniably devoid of roots and wisdom. When Cambodia creates new colors By releasing a video of the activity releasing floating lanterns in the temple. With monks and villagers working together to organize the event. But instead of getting the beauty of Yi Peng Chiang Mai It turned out to be Yi Peng, a catastrophe that made the audience unable to hold back their laughter. It starts with not having basic knowledge in managing sky lanterns. Instead, the fire will help carry the lanterns up into the sky. Instead, a piece of cloth flew off the floating lantern and stuck to the monk's robes. Until the monks had to frantically jump to avoid it. Not only that, the lanterns floated up. It also sprayed fireballs and fell onto trees in the temple area. Until it almost became a fire incident. This is not just a matter of lack of knowledge. But it also reflects a lack of readiness. and an understanding of the traditions that are attempted to be imitated. Many people who have seen the video have asked: Is this faith or just performance? To create a trend that attracts attention What adds to the irony is that the event was held in a temple that was supposed to be a sacred place. But it was filled with disorder and danger to the lives of both monks and villagers. Releasing floating lanterns that are supposed to convey peace and beauty. It turned out to be a chaotic scene, like a poorly staged comedy. If Cambodia really wants to imitate Thailand's Yi Peng We must begin by understanding the heart of the tradition. Including learning how to handle it safely and gracefully. Because if we continue like this, we will probably only get laughter and ridicule from the audience. More than the admiration Khmer might hope for Images appearing in the video It became a topic for people on social media to criticize. both the unpreparedness of the organizers and apparent lawlessness The monk had to dodge the fire that bounced off the lantern. and villagers who had to run around to extinguish fires stuck in trees It becomes a reflection of the lack of seriousness in what they are trying to imitate. Some people on social media even questioned it. Should Khmer turn around and develop their own culture? Instead of trying to bring out the strengths of other countries and use them in a half-middle-half-middle way. Because doing this does not create pride in one's own culture. Plus it makes it seem like they don't have their own identity. Some comments from people who have seen this video clip say that Just seeing the fire splashing onto the monk's robes was startling. Is this what they call a tradition or an activity that creates danger? The fire from the sharp edge flew and hit the monk's robes. It is not just a matter of danger to the monks' bodies. But it also reflects a lack of proper planning and supervision of the work. If there is a severe fire incident It will not be just material damage. But it also creates a bad image of Khmer culture. The next comment said If Cambodia is going to imitate Thailand, then do it better. This condition is like a cheap show. have no faith at all An imitation that lacks depth or attention to detail. It didn't create any admiration from the audience. It turned out to bring out its own points clearly. This work appears to be an attempt to create only a temporary trend. without understanding the heart of the true tradition This comment says that it's not just a sky lantern. But if you observe carefully Khmers seem to like to imitate many things from Thailand. From Thai costumes, Thai food , or even various festivals. But every time it comes out, it usually lacks spontaneity and depth. and seems to be trying to create an image similar to Thailand But the result was something that made people outside see the differences more clearly. What is the difference between the real thing and the imitation? The next comment said: Khmer tries to create a unique identity. By imitating what Thailand has already done. Like the floating lanterns that look like Yi Peng. But it lacks both meaning and spirit. Just like the Thai costumes that we often see in Khmer events. But it lacks the charm of the original. Imitation without true understanding It doesn't make the Khmer stand out. But instead, it causes them to be compared with Thailand in a disadvantageous way. This comment says It seems that Khmer likes to use Thai culture as inspiration in many things. But instead of developing it into something new and unique. Instead, they choose to imitate until they become a shadow of Thailand. Whether it's food like steamed rice The one that was used to dye the cat said it was royal food. or even this floating lantern tradition No matter how you look at it, it's not of good quality. Plagiarism This only makes Cambodia's image weak. This comment says Whether it is music, movies or culture, Khmers always try to use Thailand as a model. Just like the sky lanterns in this event. It is clear that they are trying to make it look like Yi is Thai. but lacks individuality The fact that a country does not have a clear identity of its own and must often imitate neighboring countries It doesn't inspire pride. This comment says Khmers think that imitating Thailand will make their culture more interesting. But in reality, it creates an image that lacks creativity. Whether it's copying Thai food Use of Thai speech in entertainment culture or even the Yi Peng floating lanterns seen in the video This kind of effort does not help them stand out. But it only emphasized their originality even more. The next comment said After looking at it, I just tried to create an image that was similar to the Thai Yi Peng. But it lacks both beauty and meaning. Releasing floating lanterns in the Yi Peng tradition of Thailand It's not just about lighting a fire and releasing it into the sky. But it has a meaning that involves letting go of your sorrows and praying for the good. But the floating lanterns in this event are from Cambodia. Instead, there is no substance or interpretation at all. Just looking at the surface reveals a failure in terms of art and culture. The next comment said Fireballs fell from the lanterns. Light up trees in the temple again. Didn't he think about safety at all? Safety should be the top priority in any job involving fire. The fireballs falling onto the trees in the temple area Not only is there a risk of fire. But it also caused damage to the temple, which is a sacred place. Organizing an event in this way It shows a complete neglect of the responsibility of the organizers. This comment says The floating lanterns seen in the video It's not about creating a culture. But it creates more chaos. Culture should reflect beauty. and unity in the community But what appears in the video is a picture of chaos. Both failed management and risks that occur Looking at it, it doesn't seem appropriate to call it a cultural event at all. Subsequent comments said that the people who organized the event did not really understand the culture. Probably just imitating it to attract tourists. Imitating to create a trend without understanding the essence of the culture Make work that should be something to be proud of. It turned out to be a subject of criticism. This event appears to be focused solely on tourism benefits. rather than providing spiritual value to the participants. This opinion describes the sophistication of the Thai Yi Peng style. There was nothing in this work at all, it was like something was done casually. Thai Yi Peng stands out for its sophistication, from the making of the lanterns to the selection of safe materials. to organizing events that reflect faith But the floating lantern festival in Cambodia It lacks everything mentioned. Making it look like it was an event that was held just for imitation. This comment says that I don't want to criticize harshly. But this is dangerous to both people and the temple. I couldn't help but see the activities being organized in a sacred place. You should pay attention to safety and respect the place. But what happened instead increased the risk and damaged the image of the temple. Saw it and felt bad. The next comment said Floating lanterns that are supposed to convey peace have instead created chaos in the temple. The peace that should occur at traditional events Instead, it was replaced with an image of a monk having to dodge fire, rushing villagers and burning trees. This made it clear that the event was a failure both culturally and administratively.
