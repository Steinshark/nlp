This is my third Coinscrum, and my first time at this august institution of higher learning. It is a bit different. When I [have been to] Coinscrum, [Laughter] There is no beer here. You will get a slightly subdued version of I'm very happy to be here, back in London. Imperial College was our major Thank you to all of the sponsors and What I wanted to talk about today is currency You have probably heard me say for a while we would see in Bitcoin would relate to foreign such as import/ export and trade. These are areas were there is friction Systems like Bitcoin, which are much more especially for underprivileged people around the world. Specifically immigrants doing foreign remittances, Well, it turns out I was wrong. It will happen again. Let's [look at] why I was wrong. Bitcoin doesn't exist in a vacuum. Bitcoin is a currency and a system of payment of international finance, which accounts for trillions of While we are off in our little corner, designing great I think it will change the trajectory of adoption Over the last two years, we are now seeing started just after the financial crisis in 2008, That currency war will change the trajectory of Bitcoin. [An externality] will change how Bitcoin is deployed. This currency war has billions of people as hostages, Let me throw out some names of countries and Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Venezuela, Argentina, What do these countries have in common? They are also currently embroiled in either The people in these countries If you were paying attention to the news recently, with less than four hours' notice -- that the two largest denomination bills, would cease to be legal tender in four hours. This removed 88% of cash in circulation, in a country more than 60% of the population has no bank account, In my opinion, this will be seen in It will unfold over the next year, The immediate effect will probably be The ripple effect: entire industries crawl to a halt and people are unable to buy food, unable to pay This has been an absolute disaster in the short term Make no mistake: this is an experiment with 15% If this experiment is successful, but whether the government's aims are It will be repeated just like the experiment of These experiments are accelerating. We have reached that point where it is within to once and for all eradicate cash. Cash has been [the primary] peer-to-peer, that allows individuals to transact It is now being eradicated in favour of digital [forms control, confiscation, and negative interest rates. All of these things will follow very closely That is their hope. Hopefully, you will be There is another currency war going on, This is where nation is pitted against nation as a trade war instrument in order to trip the in countries suffering from enormous debt If you are a government with debt measured in the By increasing standards of living and productivity Or by confiscating the savings of retirees and and [forcing] them to pay the debt We know which [option] countries are choosing. Of course, that is not how they sell it. They don't say &quot;Our plan to [relieve] debt is create a system of shadow taxation and confiscation, They say, &quot;This will eradicate black money, [Most people hear that and] say, This promise is almost always The great scourge of the emerging 21st century Fascism is rising. Just as politicians wrap themselves in the flag, they also They wrap money, the policies of wealth destruction If you disagree with the idea that pensioners should if you disagree that a whole generation of young people or underemployed working in 'McJobs', then you are a traitor to the nationalist ideal of &quot;You probably have some corrupt money hidden, That is exactly the tone of discussion right now that it was everybody's duty as a Turkish in order to prop up the nationalist pride. Modi in India used the same exact rationale: But the people suffering the most have no The middle class that suffers a bit can wrap itself In these currency wars, there is one force that as an opportunity for people to say, That [force] is Bitcoin, [on the edge] of becoming around the world. For the first time, they will have the opportunity to say, &quot;I see where you are going. I don't believe in &quot;I will go this way and opt-out from these experiments!&quot; That will dramatically change the trajectory [In comparison], foreign remittances is &quot;Yes, let's make it easier for our poor immigrants while kind of competing with the banks to But this new proposition, that some people will and currency wars, will not be taken lightly. Bitcoin will represent, in many of these countries, When sovereigns see a direct challenge to their rule... As arbitrary, capricious, and as unconcerned with the consent they will apply full force in order to fight that threat. They will fail, but it will not be easy [to resist]. When this starts happening, the equilibrium between If you want to buy bitcoin in India today, The premium on bitcoin has gone as high It can't easily be arbitraged away because there to counter-balance the mad scramble to the exits. The Chinese yuan has devalued six times so far in 2016. Every time the Chinese yuan devalued, as millions of Chinese went for the exit. Every time this happens, a premium is paid, but here Those willing to build an exit sign, a door, and a little They will earn a 20% premium. The exchanges, the LocalBitcoins traders, those willing to take the risk and face the That premium funds infrastructure development, and all the other things necessary to [enable] normal These experiments will position governments directly Bitcoin did, but because of something When I was growing up, One of my favorite computer games was called SimCity. Yeah, lots of people have played SimCity. One of the [really cool features] of SimCity, One of the dials you could tweak was the income tax. It was always tempting to just go in there if things weren't going quite as well as you wanted, You could [increase] the income tax from 5% to 6%, You learned those consequences when you go too far. When you [raise the income tax from] 5% to 15% but then you watch your population [plummet] Those kinds of games have a name: &quot;god games.&quot; They are so satisfying because they allow you Here is another feature you could have in the game: an earthquake, a massive fire, a tsunami, None of those attacks were [more] successful at [Laughter] [Applause] These currency wars are a form of civil war They destroy generations. It is already estimated in the first few days that hundreds They couldn't access money for health treatments. Feeble, disabled, elderly people [were forced] to wait if they even owned that much [anymore]. Hundreds of people died in the first few days. Thousands of people will die in the next few Tens of thousands of people have died in because of the destruction of the monetary system. This is what happens when governments decide to the thing people depend on to build a future That weapon backfires and kills their own people. They will tell you that by encouraging people We are criminals, thugs, drug dealers, Look up what the Indian government has said just &quot;terrorists,&quot; &quot;criminals,&quot; &quot;thugs.&quot; I am just a coder, I am just a talker; If I have the opportunity to build an exit from because I know who the real terrorists are. There is no greater terrorism than [going to] war the very lifeblood of an economy, when there is no crisis; a currency war against another country. Who benefits in the end? The banks. They are bailed in. Their balance sheets in India are soaring; The government [has seen] enormous increases It has fueled an absolute orgy of corruption just like it fueled an orgy of corruption in Cyprus, When Modi announced that [those rupee notes] he also announced that the banks would be closed a run on the banks. When the banks re-opened, a significant portion Somehow, some people had access to these vaults and [totaling] billions of dollars [in rupees]. Somehow... If you studied economics, one of the which states that bad money will When I was studying economics and read this as Fortunately, I had never seen Gresham's Law in action. But we are watching Gresham's Law play When an Indian person goes to an ATM, when a Zimbabwean gets hold of U.S. dollars, Do they spend it? Hell no, they don't. They bury it, put it under the mattress, And so it immediately exits the economy. They [spend] every shitty note they have: [every 500 rupee note that is now worthless]; every Venezuelan bolivar worth shit, carried Nobody has time to count it. To their employees, dependents, homeworkers they say, &quot;This is the only money I will pay you with.&quot; &quot;Take it, leave it, or you're fired. Your choice.&quot; They offload the bad money on to people to exchange it, to be asked questions by Tax officials -- caricatures of government employees. Guess what they pay these government employees in, Only the bad money is circulating; the good money We are watching Gresham's Law in action. When these [people] get bitcoin, they will HODL and saved for their children, for their future. They will trade the bad money for bitcoin, That is where we are going: cash is being They can't win that game. Cash is something verifiable cash, peer-to-peer cash... bitcoin. Remember how this will change the trajectory [Bitcoin] will be in direct opposition to this currency war, The currency wars will fund investment in in order to [grow] that small exit sign and As these currency wars escalate over the next few years we will widen that rutted road until we are out of their currency war, for everyone to take. It won't be available for everyone at first. It will [mostly be] the richest, most educated, and But [at some point], they will [help Gradually, they will fund the infrastructure to allow more Remember: as this happens, we will be We will be called &quot;criminals&quot; We will be called &quot;criminals&quot; for simply pointing out the In each stage of escalation in the currency wars, that the economy is on fire, every chance you will be [branded] the criminal. Before long, they will re-write history to say that because you provided an exit, They will say that Bitcoin started the fire. At that point, you must all repeat and remember &quot;We are not criminals.&quot; &quot;We didn't start the fire; it was always Thank you. [Laughter] [Applause]
