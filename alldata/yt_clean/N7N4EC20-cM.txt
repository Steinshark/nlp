[desert soundscape] [ dramatic music ] [Narrator] Lookout. Guardian. Sentry. In every mob of meerkats, While others are one stands at the and scans the horizon, a machine built to watch. Their long tail creates Dark patches around their A clear membrane keeps And Inside? A panoramic view They're looking for anomalies in a landscape they A shadow that moves faster A rock. A zebra. Or something more dangerous. And as soon as they they raise the alarm. [predator shrieks, A signal for the rest [ dramatic music ] Crisis averted, thanks When we're faced with threats, we rely on watchers too. In the dark. In the ocean. In the mountains. There have always been to protect the rest. But who's looking out for when you can't hear, feel Thankfully, there are Those who stare out waiting for something to move. [ anthemic music ] When it's your job to keep you have to live and just like the attackers do. Because the only way is to think like one. This is Shane Huntley. Before working at Google, Shane worked in a much [Director] What exactly in Australian intelligence? [Shane] I really can't [Narrator] So how did end up at Google? Well, unlike most this one starts on vacation. [ rousing music , [Shane] It was early 2010. I was backpacking around and I was at this internet and there's all these articles about something called I was like, &quot;Wow!&quot; I was in the government, and we knew all this stuff but none of the victims to talk about it [Narrator] Meanwhile, in reaction to Operation Aurora, seismic shifts were taking place in how Google handled security. New technologies, new network architectures, new industry standards, new t-shirts, new mouse pads, but most importantly, new hires. [Heather] As a security if you were not working or a contractor you might have these kinds of We realized that we needed to do specialty including a group who studies nation state adversaries to prevent attackers like [Narrator] Which explains on vacation in India [Shane] &quot;Hey, Shane, I'm starting this Do you wanna move to And soon after, to start this Threat Analysis The primary job of is to understand the attackers and we can protect [Toni] We're dark There's a lot of people that are trying to do bad things It's our job to stop them. By understanding who and how they operate, we're able to apply that [Shane] So today, we track around the globe. These are government but also financially which is cybercrime, ransomware, and we also track coordinated groups trying to for malicious ends. [Narrator] The Threat is commonly referred to T.A.G. The nickname is appropriate, considering how T.A.G. and, well, tags malicious So security teams across can forge defenses and responses even before an Their smarts have helped from popping up in your and have helped keep at Fortune 500 companies. They've helped trace a mystery and have helped from local canasta groups [Shane speaking indistinctly] T.A.G. hasn't always had the but everybody has to [Shane] I managed to the week after the very It was like hundreds of to work through But when I started, there were only like 10 and I'm turning up having gone through like, &quot;Okay, what How many pieces of [bell dings] Okay, &quot;How many threat [bell dings] Okay, so green fields. We were somewhat [Narrator] The team They analyzed, they hunted, they staffed up with new experts like Toni here. [Toni] Yep. [Narrator] They built out and reports on attack strategies but the team's greatest strength didn't come from new technology, but something that Google since its inception. [Shane] We have, a really great [ dramatic music ] [Narrator] To make Google downloads the entirety to its data centers. The good and the bad. From there, and content are before they ever reach But that doesn't mean These bits of bad what the T.A.G. team [Shane] The things that need [Toni] Exploits. [Shane] Software that [Toni] Phishing messages. [Shane] Almost every that exists anywhere We can see what they do We can, like, look at This is something which I don't know how they'd build But for us, it's sort of in the Search team, and we're and technology for [Shane speaking indistinctly] So one of the things is we actually take a copy of and we feed in every piece that we've run across on the So we have our own just for searching through And this is valuable because even when attackers there's always some signatures and some ability to And a great example is what we did with a piece [Reporter] It's being [Reporter 2 speaking in Spanish] [Reporter 3] WannaCry. [Reporter 4] Ransomware has but WannaCry is different. [Narrator] WannaCry ransomware attack in history. It's a pervasive type of attack where hackers hold In a single day, WannaCry in 150 countries, crippling major institutions like banks, universities Britain's National Health [Shane] It was being sent It was causing all of but nobody knew [Narrator] In the same way, to see where a picture came from the team took the malware and plugged it into their [Shane] 'Cause we'd run these and looked at them all, we can really drill down and find what's related what accounts they're There's all these details of specifically how this one By looking at those that one link that was that it wasn't somebody It was the [White House Staffer] the United States is the massive WannaCry cyber We do not make this We do so with evidence, [Shane] We used to think or country versus country. But now, often we actually or country versus company. We certainly want to defend against Google, itself, What we really see that's is attackers coming Day to day, we are trying between the attackers and [Narrator] Identifying is an important part But the most critical is to build better defenses. Something Camille knows a thing or two about. For three years she worked evolved to stay ahead [Camille] All of the across the various directly supports safer The intelligence that T.A.G. allows them to be [Toni] So it's not just about of stopping an It's being able to turn [Shane] Chrome or YouTube. [Toni] Or Google Drive and say, we can eliminate an and protect all these users.&quot; [Narrator] So what All the techniques attackers use to go after Google's [Toni] Yeah, so there's so to try and get around One of the most common [ 'Fishing Pole' by Well now take down and meet me at We may not get but don't you rush away. [Narrator] Phishing, where bad actors to try and trick you into or handing over passwords or It's a type of attack that many of us are all [Toni] Attackers are on whatever they think So whether that's... [Camille] Threats. [Shane] Money. [Toni] A salacious [Shane] Fear is a big one. [Toni] So when the we saw a huge uptick in [Camille] As citizens, we were all and likely ready to that might provide some clarity. [Narrator] This became the ideal strike zone preying on people's around the pandemic to leveraging phony details to and to pedal sham [Toni] There's a lot of money So you have this explosion driven by criminal motivations. How do we protect users And the scale of these And a huge part of it it never makes it to your inbox. [Narrator] Inside built in to block over 100 [Camille] If Google all of that malicious activity-- the spam, phishing and malware-- your inbox would essentially [Narrator] This mine through a web of smart filters that evolve and reorient based [Camille] They not only but they learn from They are leveraging from the T.A.G. team to pull from your inbox 99.9% of the threats. [Shane] I think what keeps is just what's at stake [Toni] Gmail has over We have to secure everyone. And certainly there are people who have a bigger That's politicians, that's other that's journalists, All these people are targets [Narrator] In most cases, the first step in is knowing you might [Shane] We actually tell that's targeted by a We put a big warning at or other service to let [Toni] We've stopped We blocked it. But we want you to know [Shane] Some people think this but actually like, over we actually warn around that they're targeted by [Narrator] There's perhaps of foreign nation state than in the government. Just ask Michael Kaiser. He's the head of Defending a group dedicated to providing to campaign officials [Michael] There are who would not like to Bad actors who are trying or make the process And campaigns would be a [Shane] We don't run any We don't build software but we do have candidates that use our services, They use our phones. And we do see that that are trying to interfere of not just US elections, [Toni] One of the things is that political campaigns in a lot of ways [Michael] So who is part Well, you have staffers. You probably have volunteers. You have the candidate, and then you have people Close friends, confidants, all these people are We believe that with a campaign is [Toni] Even if I'm an intern, if they can compromise that gives the into the campaign's network. It's not enough to sort of that you see on the front The reality is you have [Narrator] After all Google has learned about protecting large and has used those learnings to create something called [Toni] Advanced Protection It's very similar to with its own employees, And basically what it requires That makes your account because it means even if they've managed to they can't get into [Michael] If you have your account pretty much [Toni] It tremendously cuts from all of these [Shane] Protecting is a fundamental thing that keeps me enthused and makes me proud of This is some of our and something that we [girl shouts joyously] [subway humming] [Narrator] The problems that the Threat may seem larger than life. Most of us have enough to manage without having to worry and cyber criminals encroaching on our accounts. [Shane] Over the last decade, the actors have got a lot and they've had to because We haven't made their life easy. And this is valuable because the more effort the safer the users are. [Narrator] Each innovation makes it a little more So although there entering the game the table stakes to are often entirely [Shane] I'm in this battle not I'm in this battle because We may not win 100% of the time, but we can make a lot more and prevent a lot of attacks. [Toni] That's what is to take that weight off We want you to use and not click on Leave the rest [ anthemic music ] [Matt] We're a lot like A 24-hour, 7 day a week force against whatever it is [Fatima] Right now, there are thousands of attacks [Shane] We started seeing North Korea targeting fake social media profiles. [Toni] One of the last their hands on this is the North Korean government. [Fatima] We might have and start from scratch. [Matt] I love it. [laughs]
