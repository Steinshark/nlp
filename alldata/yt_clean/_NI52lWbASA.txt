I've never known a man so hungry for money. Studyin' up to buy us an army. Don't you remember? - Still dreamin' about that? We could set up our own republic on this country. Take that bank money and the Comancheros will sell us 100, We put uniforms on 'em. Yeah, fix us up an army. And I could drill 'em. Left face, right face... Raise this arm. Raise it. Higher.

Then stop wasting my time. Wait a minute. Missoura. That's where it was. A fella just about your size, Yellowleg sergeant. Somebody had tried to scalp him. He cut the sergeant up pretty badly You know, if you take off your hat, you could make me out a liar. It's you, all right. You certainly went out of your way to look me up, I've kind of got used to keeping it on. Why? You haven't got anything to hide but a few battle scars. - What did you do after the war ended? - I'd go after that Reb. Is that Reb in town? Well, what are you waiting for? I'm waiting to get him alone. You see, I want him to know who I am. I want him to know he's Are you sure you found the right man? Yeah, I'm sure. And I'm askin' you, my friends...

Let me know when that If his patience ever does wear out. That pretty redhead that just What do you lovely I think it's Monday. - Get your horse. Get it. Billy! Hey, Billy! Yellowleg's ready. Somethin' wrong with Somebody get the doc. He's dead. It was them outlaws, Kit. No. It was me. - 'Is she the dance hall woman? 'Imagine comin' in here like she was respectable, - 'Imagine! - 'Poor boy. 'And her holding the prayer book like she was respectable!' That Yellowleg sure has He ain't quite makin' it though. Some men are like that. Give me two. The boy's leanin' awful hard on him. You reckon the Mayor will be able to talk Ain't nothin' gonna change her mind. She got Doc Acton to take care of the body and rented herself a wagon. Goin' alone if she has to. We've come to change your mind, Kit. We've decided to have a nice funeral for the boy in Gila City. The whole town will come. As Mayor, I'll see to it. Mead will be buried in Siringo next to his father. Now, Kit... Bury him here? You think I haven't heard all the whispering? - You and your gossiping little wives with their pinched &quot;That dance hall woman with her freckle-faced woods colt. &quot;No telling who the father might be!&quot; They smell brimstone every time I walk by. They hated us both, me and the boy. Well, he's dead now and you can tell your wives that there was no sinning and there'll be no funeral. I'm taking him to Siringo. You can't do that. It's smack in the middle of Apache Besides, there's not much of it left but the weeds. I've tried, Kit. I've asked everybody. I'm not asking anybody to go with me. Poor Kit. - Are you a single man? - I didn't know that, Cal. Me and Emma. She wouldn't let me go with Kit. Not that way. Not to mention the Apaches. I ain't never seen a town so full of cowards. I ain't never seen a town so scared of Indians. You can take three. Kit! ? I hate to think what all that sun will do to your face. Will you take this? No, thanks, Cal. Take it. I've got no use for it. I can't sell it. Imported all the way from St Louis. Get down from there! I said get down! - Somebody's got to drive this for you. I'm askin' to. I said get down! Need any help, ma'am? - Get out of here, Billy. Your place. Get down. I bet she don't get 20 miles before she turns around. 50 dollars. And a call. What have you got?

Looks like you and me is gonna go to Siringo. Billy, you and I ain't leavin' here. I'm just backin' him up. Yeah, I kinda like the idea of going to Siringo with that redhead. Come on. What's the matter? Come on! I guess you don't mind the Yellowleg orderin' you around, But if I could handle that six-shooter like you, Billy boy... His back's pointin' right at ya. What's the matter? Scared? Scared he might hear your gun comin' out of the holster? That ain't no fit way to kill a man. Not even a Yankee. There she is. - Good morning, ma'am. - Will you let me drive that wagon for you? Well, I'd be mighty proud to ride Leave me alone! Both of you. Well, now, you know it ain't Well, it ain't exactly safe for you either. Any of you. Now git! Why don't you leave this Listen, that bank is probably just now opening up. Yeah, it probably is, probably is. We'll follow along and see she gets through. Turkey, that's a woman! Come on, let's go. Your dress is kinda wet. I guess It shouldn't take long in this heat. I never did see a dance-hall You stay away from me. What will you do with that rock? Use it on me? Or a shotgun if I have to! Well, ma'am, I always did go for high stakes. Apaches They scalped him. Yeah. It looks like they did. Come on, let's get back to that wagon. Hey, the coffee's ready! It's plain to see that woman don't want us round here, Did you desert? - Hmm? I don't remember telling I figured you for a deserter. How did you guess? Maybe I ought to take her a Leave her alone. Are you... Are you talkin' to me? Hey, Billy, I think Yellowleg's - And we thought he was feelin' sorry about that boy. - Touchy too. Like he is about that hat he keeps wearin'. - You know what I think he's got under it? Money. Well, there's one way we could find out. We can ask him... Take your hat off, Yellowlegs. He's scared of you, Billy. Yellowlegs... Take your hat off or I'll shoot it off. You try it and I'll kill you. Yellowlegs, there's something Better mind your thinkin', kid. We could go back to that bank. We could set up our own little republic You know, the republic of Freedonia? All this land out here, just a-waitin'. You're the kind of trigger-happy I'd make you my military aide. Then we'd start makin' up a lot of laws, - They don't now. They never did. If it's run right. But we've got to start Turkey, don't you ever shut It's sure quiet out here, isn't it? I don't blame you for but right now, Are you always that stubborn Lady... I'm just tryin' to help. Who are you trying to help? Riding shotgun on this wagon isn't I'm beginning to wonder if you What are you trying to say? I mean, right here is as You don't have to prove anything to me. Damn you! - Look at 'em fightin'! You don't know me well Hating is a subject I know You've got to be careful I know somebody who spent five Hating and wanting revenge He spent all them years and when he caught up with He'd get his revenge all right, but then he'd lose the - What was that for? Nothing like letting the That ain't no fit way to kill You go on up ahead and - There might be some Apaches out there. You know, you could get the sun here. I'll get used to it. We'll be leaving you in Siringo. You can find your own way back. Come on. Turk, what are you doin' out here? This ain't your guard. I want to show you somethin'. I've been carryin' this around with me for a long while. - What's that? I stole it over at San Antonio. I never did show it to anybody before. A man sure really looks like something wearin' one of these, If you're waitin' for me to salute you, you're gonna wait a long time. Here, I want to show you something else. Here... Come here. See that part right there? It's not on a regular map. A valley. Not many people know it's there. We're gonna buy ourselves some slave Indians. We'll be able to burn a fire path through What do you say, boy? Huh? What do you say to that, huh? Fine, Turk, fine. Take over my guard for me, will you? I never travelled with a lady before. It kinda appeals to me. - Get out of my way. I'm telling you to leave me alone. I don't wanna... I don't wanna trouble you, Kit. I just wanna be sociable. And I never wear my guns when I make a social call. I always did like pretty things and... You're just about the prettiest I've ever seen. Saddle up. Come on, get out of here. - I'm goin' with you, Billy. - He wouldn't stand a chance in Apache country alone. Tack! He's gone. - They'll be going back to Gila City, both of them. You still going to Siringo? - You think you can stop me? I'm sorry about losing the horse. - Well, you don't have to talk to me, you know! Five years is a long time to turn your back on, Lady, I quit thinking when I turned my horse around. Stop calling me Lady! My name is Kit. - I don't know you well enough! You're not half as mad at me as you are at yourself. Gonna talk all the way to Siringo? Grab that shotgun! Come on! Must have ambushed that stage down at the border. I sure wish I could take a bath. Well, nothing's stopping you. Come on. Want some more? You know... I can hardly remember what my husband looked like. We were only married a few weeks. ..he was killed in Siringo. When Mead was born, they wouldn't believe me. Gila City put a brand on both of us. With their... jokes and their... talk and their ugly little smiles. Getting dark. We've got to have another horse. Them Apaches can't be far off. They've got plenty of horses. You wait right here until I get back. Kit! Pack up. We're moving out. That's far enough. I don't think I can stay awake another minute. You'll have to. Start digging. - What?! Our trail's got to look Indian. If we're lucky, those Apaches are still trying to find their stagecoach. Getting tired? I didn't ask for any help. I wasn't offering any. I just asked if you were getting tired. Is Yellowleg a name? Well, it'll do. - Where are you from? Is it pretty back there? Used to be. What are you doing? Do and I'll kill you. - How could he miss? Well, why didn't he kill us? He's got a little score Start packing up. - Can't forgive me for making you give up those five years, can you? Hardly seemed worth the trouble. There you go. He broke it. What is he waiting for? Why doesn't he kill us? He will when he's ready. - Why don't you kill us and get it over with?! Come on! - Leave me alone! - Why do you let him torture us? Our Apache friend's been awful quiet. Maybe he got bit by a snake. - Do you think it's much further? - Siringo. - Siringo what? Strange. I feel I know you better than any man I've ever known. Yet I hardly know you at all. - What are you trying to do? - What did you expect to find? I was only trying to make you more comfortable. I'm sorry. Sorry... There's... some things about me you don't understand. You killed the only person I loved in this whole world. That's all I need to know about YOU. Next time I'll be waiting for him. Inside. Go on. This'll do. Here. You've got enough buckshot in there to stop an army. He ought to be on top of the bluff by sundown, so I'll wait for him. If I'm not back by morning, you're on your own. Wait. I... just wanted to say... ..thank you. Where is it? By the mission? What was your husband's name? Mead Tildon. My son was named after him. I couldn't find it. It's there. No, there ain't nobody named Tildon buried there. You're just the same as all the rest of them. Here it is. It must be one of the others. Kit! Kit! I found it! I found it. Yellowleg. - Where's Turk? When Billy gets hold of an idea, he just won't let go of it. Well, there's no need to keep Let's step inside and talk things over. Sorry I can't offer you folks a drink. - What did you do with the money? - Only one thing would bring him down here I never saw folks so scared of Injuns. I tell you, she sure is pretty. Turkey, go get that money. - Are you crazy? - You know, I... I just ain't got the heart to kill him. How would you like to have your gun back? - You want me to do it? - Just the minute he walks back through this door. We'll decide that later. You and me. Well, I'm going for a little walk. I'll be around. The lady's got to admit I got guts. You'd better get out of here. - You can't! - I've waited five years. The waiting is over. Now keep out of it. What happened to Mead was an accident. I know that now, even though I thought that I could never forgive you for it. But I could never love a man who was a cold-blooded killer. Love? You don't even know me. I'm a face under a hat. Ever wonder why I won't take this off? - Want to talk about love? What about MY scars? Do you know how many men I've let kiss me just Men with dirty shirts, smelly arms, money in their pockets. Can those scars be forgotten? Can I ask you to love a... ..a woman like that? Now don't that make a pretty picture? Where's Billy? - Out of the way. All this shooting and he ain't even touched him yet. Tack!i Billy! Are you crazy?! All right, Yellowleg. This is it. - You and me. There ain't but two horses in this town. You turned on me, Billy. And I raised him from a puppy. I'm not giving him this money. No Get me some slave Indians... I'll train them myself. Take all this money... Yellowleg, Yellowleg, listen to me. We can make ourselves a deal. I don't want that Billy with me. I want you! Now come on, listen to reason. Why can't a Yankee join up with a Rebel? We could do it together. Look at all this money here. I'll make a general out of you. General Yellowleg. Listen, Yellowleg, like I told you up there... - You're gonna be in my army. You know where you left it, don't you? - Chickamauga. - No... Oh, Yellowleg, listen to me, I don't want that Billy... Yellowleg, I'll make a general out of you. - Don't! Get out of here! - Don't! Billy! Billy! You tell Yellowleg Hi. We're trailing a couple of bank robbers. - Where's the other? - Inside. You know how people are. If it's their money... - the gates of hell wouldn't stop them. Parson, we're going to need a few - We're burying a boy alongside of his dad. - This is a convoy. Gentlemen, you're going to I'll soon have your uniforms for you. Thank you, sir. Well, Captain, Forward, yo! Fill up those ranks! Forward march! Follow me, men! We'll get us an army, we know what to do. We buy some slave Indians...
