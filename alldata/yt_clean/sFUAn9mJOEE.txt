Bring Cici along to the auction tonight too. She is now part of the Wood family. This is a good opportunity to introduce her to the big families. The auction? What auction? Will there be food? Will there? Make sure she dresses up nicely. Don't let her embarrass the Wood family. Alright, Mr. Wood. What shabby shoes. Hmph. It's unbelievably uncomfortable, making me suffer. These fancy clothes are the standard attire for attending high-end banquets. These clothes aren't even as good as those I wore for our wedding pictures. Then just change back into those you wore for the wedding pictures. Mr. Wood, please reconsider. Otherwise... I'm all changed. I... Master! What's wrong? This sound... Could it be... Master? Sweetheart. This is Mom's Master. Thanks to him, Mom honed her skills. That's how Mom was able to bring you into the world. Hello, Master. Ah. Okay. What an adorable little apprentice! Master. This little one is quite a handful. You definitely shouldn't think she's annoying. Why would I? When you were little, you were even more rambunctious than she is. Master, what was my mom like when she was a child, what was she like? Your mom, was always very genuine from childhood onward. She was always curious about the world. She never stuck to the rules. Mom, what does it mean to be a rule-breaker? How can I explain it? It's you. Maintain an honest attitude. Approach each situation with care. Don't harbor ill will. Then you'll receive an abundance of delicious treats. When I grow up, I want to be like Mom. Not follow the usual rules. You little clever rascal. In the future, you'll surely learn the essence of your mom. Finally, we can go and eat delicious food now. Mr. and Mrs. Wood, congratulations to you both. Your baby is very healthy. We just conducted a thorough examination. All the results are normal. That's wonderful! Thank you, Doctor. Looking at her, it's all worth it. Oh, by the way, Mrs. Wood, although your health is good. Not bad, but make sure to pay attention to rest and taking care of yourself. Previously, to protect the pregnancy, I sacrificed too much. I will, thank you, doctor. I'll be off now. The baby is asleep. Cici, it's time for dinner. I made your favorite chicken noodle soup. Fell asleep. I've been thinking about it. Once our child is ready, when she's a little older, we can enroll her in the best preschool. Meanwhile, I've also hired you a certified postpartum recovery coach. Yves, thank you for always considering me so thoughtfully. But more important than that, I truly wish for us to be a safe and sound family filled with happiness. We will achieve that. Absolutely, it will. No matter what the future brings, I'll always hold your hand and walk with you. Mr. Wood, congratulations. Ma'am has given birth to a very healthy daughter. Why did this happen? But just a moment ago the situation was clearly very critical. It was indeed critical. But I still need to set a good example for the baby. be a role model. So I applied some techniques. Techniques? I relied on over twenty years of expertise to protect her. However... What? When this little one was born, she was quite restless. It completely wore me out. It was more exhausting than my training. As long as the mother and baby are safe, that's all that matters. From now on, I won't let you two, suffer any more hardships. If you dare let her suffer, Yes, definitely. Even if I have to risk everything, I will make sure to take good care of both of you. Okay. By the way, what do you think, what should we name this little one, what would be a good name? I hope that when she grows up, she's as innocent and kindhearted as you. Let's name her, Jane Wood. Jane Wood. Jane Wood. That's a lovely name. Little one, grow up quickly, so you can help me keep Mom safe. And Dad too. We'll be a tight-knit family. You must be living a very happy life. End the pregnancy. Yes. Otherwise, the woman will bleed excessively. There isn't any other option, is there? We're out of time. Should we save the mother or the child? Make a choice. How did it come to this? Save the mother. We must save the mother, no matter what. Alright. Cici. Cici. Just like you said. I finally got through it. I'm sorry. Why are you apologizing? The child couldn't be saved. What? Please don't get upset. I know you. It's hard to accept right now. But the situation just now was really urgent. I could only choose to save you. Honey, the doctor has already told me. So, you know the child is gone. The child is still here. Still here? The mother is experiencing heavy bleeding. Quickly inform the blood bank to prepare blood supplies. Honey. My stomach really hurts. Don't be scared, Cici. The baby's moving around inside. We will soon be able to see her. Is that alright, Cici? Cici, Family members are not allowed to enter. We must ensure their safety. The mother and baby are safe. Whatever the cost, I can afford it. We'll do everything we can. Where are the pregnant woman's relatives? I'm her husband. The patient has severe uterine bleeding. There's a significant risk to her life. Unless... Unless what? Unless... We might have to terminate the pregnancy. Eight months later Little one. Make sure to be good today too. Dad needs to leave for work soon. Don't worry, Cici. I'll be back as soon as I can. Take your time. What's up? I eat this every day. It's so plain. I miss my fried chicken legs. Good. When our baby arrives, you can enjoy these again, all the tasty ones. The little one should come out soon. Your mom has been waiting for this for a long time. What's up, Hal? Mr. Wood, I've got good news. Our Wood Group has finally secured a significant investment. We're getting ready to go public. There's an emergency meeting tonight. Your attendance is required. Okay, understood. I'll go prepare. Cici, Yeah? Our company is going public. Really? Uh-huh. What's going on? Cici. I think I'm about to have the baby. Master, why do you oppose it? Why? What are you opposing? Well, Cici. Uh, your intentions are good, but practice and business, are ultimately two separate matters. The mountain is a tranquil place, not ideal for too much business activity. I guess I was oversimplifying things. Hmm. You've come to the mountain. Then I definitely won't have a peaceful life here. Alright, Cici. I still think your idea is very visionary. However, we could change the approach. For instance, we could establish a nearby charity foundation or educational institution. This way, we can provide the locals with benefits. It won't affect the tranquility of the mountain. calmness. Exactly. This way you can fulfill your desires without disturbing the mountain's serenity. Thank you, Yves. Everyone must be starving. I'll go whip up something to eat. Ah. Cici, what would you like to eat? Grandma will make it for you, dear. Granny, I crave something sweet and tangy. Alright, alright, alright. Oh, grandma. I'll get that ready for you. Come on. Let's toast to this family. And to the future of Wood Group. Cheers. Cheers. It's so wonderful having you all. Same here. With you all around, I find the motivation to move forward. Right? Thank you, Master. Thank you, Grandma. By the way, I have something I want to discuss with you. Go ahead, Grandma is listening. I plan to give half of our shares in the Wood Group to Cici. It's a gesture of appreciation for her support. for everything she's done for me. It's also for our unborn child's future, to provide security. You have grown up. He knows to cherish the people around him. Grandma supports your decision. Yves. How much is half of the shares? It's just over two hundred billion. Over two hundred billion. Ones, tens, hundreds, Millions, ten millions, hundred million. Over two hundred billion is. Is that a lot? Yeah. A whole lot. But even if it's more, You're more important than anything. Doesn't that mean I can work while I'm pregnant and not worry about being fired. Silly. Who would dare to fire my woman? I can finally, rightfully, provide for my baby be a role model. Oh right, I have another thought. Go ahead, I want to use these shares to our mountain is really beautiful. I'm sure a lot of people will come. What I like Indeed, the mountains are indeed a great spot for tourism to develop resources. I can then bring the Wood family business and open a branch there. Cici, you have quite an eye for this. When that happens, I'll hand over that branch for you to manage. Sounds good. Then I can visit often. I checked on the master and the senior brothers. I disagree. Ah, your voice and presence, your palm reading, is full of blessings. You'll have luck in love. I'm already almost seventy. What kind of love luck could I have? Hey, even though you're seventy... Oh, you're back. Grandma, Master, why haven't you gone back to the mountain yet? Cici, Uh, Master, I... was with Grandma Gu, I was with Grandma Gu. We really clicked. So I'm planning to stay down here at the mountain base for a while. Grandma. Master. Why are you two dressed so... Similarly. How should I explain this to the girl? We just got these matching outfits. Coincidentally. You don't need to ask about that. It's not coincidental. It was pre-arranged. Your Master said. Dressing this way can bring good luck. Let's give it a try. Exactly. Dressing like this. Not only can it improve. Family harmony. It can also enhance. The bond between relatives. Oh. Really? Yes. This master and grandma. Are also here to offer our unborn baby their blessings. Isn't that right? Are you doing this for her? Is it really worth it? This Wood Group is worth billions. Without it, in G City, you'll just be an average person. What's wrong with being ordinary? You really don't understand Cici, or what she means to me. Alright. I've lost. You lost? Cici, are you alright? What on earth is going on here? You're not a match for me right now. And you won't be one in the future either. Let go of me, Cici! Today, I want to settle this with you. We'll fight to the death! Why do you keep pestering me? Because you don't deserve happiness. Do you think Yves Wood truly wants to be with you? He just wants to get his hands on... Divine Elixir. Alright, then let's make a bet. If he's just after... Divine Elixir, I'll take my child with me. And leave. If he isn't the one. Don't ever show up again. In front of me. Alright. I never thought you'd really. Do that for me. Give up Divine Elixir. And the Wood Group. Nothing is more important than you. More important, really. What about him? You are both the most important people in my life. The most significant. Pick up the phone. Hello? Cici? Are you pregnant? Oh. Mr. Wood, you finally realized your little wife is pregnant. June Smith, what did you do to Cici? Don't worry, Mr. Wood, if you want to save your wife, and the child she's carrying, right now, bring Divine Elixir to me. June Smith. June Smith. June Smith. What about Cici? You brought the stuff, right? Divine Elixir you wanted. You're really willing to part with it. With Divine Elixir in hand, go save Cici. And don't forget, without her, you'll end up as a blind person again. As long as Cici is with me, I'm not afraid of anything. Sure. Since you care so deeply for her, sign it then. What is this? This is the transfer agreement for your Wood Group. transfer agreement. June Smith, isn't this a bit too much? Don't you have strong feelings for your Cici? Then I want to see if you're willing to do it for her. Risk the Wood family legacy. The result of generations of hard work. Just as expected. Your feelings for her aren't all that special. Alright. I'll sign it. I won't keep you then. No. It's still early. She's always joking around. How about we... find a tea house? We can sip tea and chat. I can also share some wellness tips with you. So if... you're not in a rush, that'd be perfect. Granny. My master is great at teaching health tips. It's really something. If you were pregnant too. That will definitely boost your inner strength. It's great for your health and longevity. She just loves to joke around. Just ignore her. Let's get going. Go on. Hey there. Cici. After we return from this break. Everyone's so energetic. Absolutely. Looks like I picked the right person. I want to be a role model too. A role model, for whom? Oh, it's nothing. Wait for me to come pick you up. This evening. Let's enjoy a nice meal. Are we having those again? Oh. This time, I specially made for you a selection of sweet and sour treats. You'll love it. Alright, thank you, darling. This is Divine Elixir. Cici mentioned. Only if she's pregnant, her master would supply more. Could it be... Is she pregnant? Your skills have greatly increased. It's just that I had to send this girl down the mountain. That's just the reason I gave. Since she believes that, I should go along with what she thinks. Haha. The Master would never deceive. Do you know why your skills have improved so much? The real reason, what is it? What is it? Hmm, hmm, hmm. Because you are about to become a mother. And from ancient times till now, there's a saying that's been passed down. It's 'A mother is strong.' Hmm. I see. Ah. It's getting late. I'm heading back to the mountain. Okay, goodbye, master. Goodbye. Now her master is leaving too. I finally have a chance to proceed. Cici. You're pregnant. Why are you running around everywhere? Are you done yet? Grandma, I was just about to go home. Hello, beautiful lady. Cici, this is... Oh. Grandma, this is my master. I've heard Cici talk about you before. Thank you for training my granddaughter-in-law. You've taught her wonderfully. Once you get to know her better, you'll see how she can be a bit of a handful. Uh, that's just her nature. She's naturally a... smart and well-behaved girl. I just gave her a little guidance. You're too humble. Oh, by the way. Master, aren't you heading back to the mountain? Winnie Green is so incompetent. She still couldn't deal with Cici Hall. It seems I'll have to take care of it myself. My good disciple. Master. Eh! Wait a moment. You're expecting now. Stop being so impulsive. Oh no. Got it, Master. Here it is! This is Divine Elixir. I can't believe you really gave Divine Elixir to this woman. Hahaha, Divine Elixir, consider it as my gift to you, and for my unborn grand-disciple's celebration gift. Thank you, Master. I always keep my promises. From now on, focus on taking care of your pregnancy. Whether there's something going on, or not, just don't go back to the mountain. Understand? Yes, I understand, Master. But there's one thing, that's actually quite true. What is it? It's about sleeping with a man. After getting pregnant, your powers do significantly increase. Goodbye, Mrs. Wood. Bye. Thank you so much. Mrs. Wood. You're truly a great leader. Have fun! Have fun! Bye. Enjoy yourself. The great idea you suggested. Is for everyone to take a month's paid leave? Yeah, my mentor mentioned. It's important to balance work and rest. The reason they I'm feeling unmotivated. That's because of the long work hours. The hours are too long. We really need to take some time to unwind. But what about the leftover work? What should be done about it? Ma'am, Aren't you worried about Mr. Wood reprimanding you? Don't I have you here with me? Me? Hey, Where are you heading? I'm coming along too. Just to kick back and relax. You. I'm so mad. Hey, Winnie, why did we get a 30% pay cut this month? I know, right? Even though this month, we've been working overtime every day. And our salary? It's out of my hands. It's because of Mrs. Wood, she's the one who signed off on the pay cut. How does she have the authority to cut our pay? What did she say? That the overtime every day is due to our low work efficiency. So, Salary cuts. She's really overstepping. Taking advantage of being the CEO's wife. She's doing whatever she pleases. Winnie. You need to stand up for us. Cici Hall. Now everyone in the company. Is turning against you. I wonder how you're going to. Continue working here. Good morning. What's gotten into them? Ever since you came. Everybody's lost their drive. Strangely enough, Oh, that's how it is. Mrs. Wood. Not to put too fine a point on it, before you came along, everyone was pretty upbeat. After your arrival, everyone was trying to work with you, but it kind of dampened their spirits. I've come up with an idea. What's the idea? A way to get everyone fired up. Ah. Ouch, ouch, ouch. I'm already being gentle. You just hit me so hard. Well, you suddenly appeared behind me. That was self-defense. Back to the point, why were you rummaging around in the fridge at midnight? Hey. Be gentle. It hurts. I've been eating too much lately. I'm trying to find something sour to help my digestion. Like this, Hmm, But Cici. Huh? I feel like you've been a bit different lately. What's different about me? I can't quite put my finger on it. It's just not as carefree as before. Though it's a good change, I still feel like there's something you're not telling me. I'm sleepy, so I'm going to bed now. Goodnight. We can't let him know about the baby yet. Otherwise, he definitely won't let me go to work. In the future, how can I set an example for my baby? Cici, are you alright? I'll take you to the hospital now. No need. Seriously, I'm okay. Yeah. I'm fine. If you're fine, then why are you throwing up? I just ate too much. Alright. Too bad about that entire table of food. I didn't eat anything all day. I'm starving. Could there be a thief in here? Who's there? Are you okay? Cici Hall is so malicious. She actually tricked me. If she could have tricked you, she would have done it by now. She's just lucky. I've already dashed to the bathroom over ten times. I'm on the verge of collapsing. I absolutely need to avenge this. She can hide for now, but she can't hide forever. We've got plenty of ways, to get the best of her. Are you alright in there? I... We're out of toilet paper. It smells so good! You're back! Today I made all your favorites. This is to reward you for lately. For signing a deal with White Group contract. Come on. In that case, I'm going to finish everything today. Don't hold back. I'm pregnant now. I don't really have an appetite for these. What's up? Isn't this stuff you usually love? Give it a taste. Come on, it's roasted drumsticks! This way, it won't go to waste. D*mn it. I was originally planning to watch Cici Hall while she drank coffee. But I accidentally fell asleep. Looks like she's already drunk it. Mission accomplished. Wait for you to have diarrhea and a miscarriage. That's odd. Did I not finish the coffee yesterday? Did I not drink it all? This coffee is pretty sweet this time. It's quite tasty. Oh no. What is this? It's incredibly bitter. This coffee is originally from abroad. High-class folks all drink this. You guys drink this at work. It's like cat pee. Then aren't you every day looking so gloomy? If you think it's too bitter, I'll get you some syrup. Cici Hall. I'll just wait until you finish drinking the coffee. Ma'am, it's definitely sweeter than honey. Go ahead. No way. I still can't drink it. What's wrong now? It's too hot; it'll burn my mouth. So what do you want to do? I'll wait for it to cool down a bit. I'll drink it once it cools. Alright. Make sure you drink it. Otherwise, it'd be rude. You can get back to what you were doing. This stuff is really hard to swallow. And I can't just dump it out. It spoiled the gesture. We need to find a way. She is now Mr. Wood's wife. It's hard to get her out of the picture. Do you know why she became Mrs. Wood? That foolish woman probably won't be deceiving Mr. Wood. Could it be that...? She's pregnant. Hmph. No wonder Mr. Wood wants her to be the one. Take my place. And treat her like she's his pride and joy. The problem now is. It's not about being fixated on her. What she possesses. But instead, we need to make. Her lose something important. Lose? Do you mean? Yes, cause her to miscarry. In this way. She won't have Mr. Wood's child. Mr. Wood. He won't care for her anymore. So, what should I do? This is a laxative. Everything relies on this. Mrs. Wood, here's your coffee. I didn't order any coffee. Oh, my apologies. I'm just getting used to this. I thought it was the waiter. No worries. Please enjoy it while it's hot. I'm not going to drink this. You. Ma'am. You don't really think that, do you? You signed. The big contract with White Group. And now you're feeling pretty proud. Not giving me any respect, huh? I'll drink. I'll drink. What? Aren't you keeping your promise? I'll drink. I'll drink. Alright then. Go ahead and sign it. Sign it. I'll sign it. Oh! You scared me! Congrats! You landed it so easily the White Group contract. Countless companies are fighting hard, but can't even get in line to work with White Group. Cici. You're really amazing. You must be great with alcohol. Hey, it's nothing. Besides, who says networking, has to involve alcohol? What should I do next? I heard the White Group's contract, Winnie spent a whole year, and still couldn't land it. Now Mrs. Wood got it, stealing the spotlight overnight. She must be livid. Cici Hall, we're not done yet. Who are you? You don't need to worry about who I am. You just need to know I'm just like you. That we both want to bring down Cici Hall and leave her with no way out. Haven't you ever had a drink before? All you need to do is finish this bottle. Our boss, Mr. White will sign the contract with you immediately. Can pregnant women drink alcohol? No, they can't. Pregnant women shouldn't drink alcohol. I'm sorry. I can't drink alcohol. You? Hmph. Woman! You're the first one who's brave enough to refuse me. Why doesn't anyone dare to refuse you? Is it because I'm scared of you? Oh dear. You're saying this with your eyes wide open. That's nonsense. Let me tell you something. If we don't finish this bottle of wine today, you won't be able to leave here. You can forget about leaving this place. How dare you provoke Mr. White! It seems like you have a death wish. I told you I can't drink. You can't drink. You can't drink. I'll help you. You dare to take action, woman? I'm going to initiate you into something different today. What? Do you want to try it too? Oh no, definitely not. Spare me, oh fearless one. I'll sign the contract, really. Hold on a second. Didn't you mention that we have to finish the drink before signing? Hey man. Oh wow, I have no idea who's coming today, the attractive woman here to sign the contract. What she's going to be like. Regardless of who she is, as soon as she gets here, she's going to end up surrounded by us guys, and we're going to have our fun. Those women, just so they can sign with us, are fully ready to spend time with us. What can you do about it? Waitress. Get us, the guys, two more bottles of good wine. I'm here on behalf of the Wood Group to sign the contract. Is Wood Group really lacking sincerity? Why would they send someone who looks like a waitress, to discuss the partnership? Hey, Mr. Lawson, that's not the right thing to say. Everyone who comes is our guest, isn't that right, Mr. Lawson? What Mr. White said is true. Come over here. Thankfully, it didn't get wet. Hey there, your pants are wet. Do you want me to help you change? No, thanks. It's dry underneath. You must be Mr. White. Isn't that right? Let's get the contract signed. Wow, you're pretty direct. Do you know who Mr. White really is? Do you think you need to... teach him how to do his job? Bro. The contract is ready for signing. But we have to follow the necessary procedures, we can't skip any steps. What exactly do you mean by 'procedures'? You need to drink this bottle of liquor. I'll sign the contract immediately. Hello, Mr. Wood. Carry on with your work. Mr. Wood, This is the bidding event for this year. It needs your signature. This is my secretary, Winnie Green. From now on, have her. guide you with investments. I have other matters to handle. If you have any questions, just ask her. Alright. Bye. Mr. Wood appointed his wife. It can't be that taking over Ms. Green's position, right? Of course. After all, a personal secretary is such a unique position. Would definitely be given to the wife; that would be more appropriate. Perhaps the lady herself requested it. You're all just sitting around gossiping, don't you have work to do? Please guide me in the future. Sure. I'll definitely guide you well. Thought being Mrs. Wood meant You're just brought in from above. You're taking over the efforts I've put in. A role I've held for more than a decade. Not a chance. Watch how I force you out. What should I do next? Oh. Tonight, there's a very important business banquet. It's with the renowned G City-based, White Group for a signing. As the wife of President Wood, you can certainly represent Wood Group to finalize this Big deal Alright, I'll make sure to get it done. Those people from White Group are all cutthroat. To hell with the socializing. No one comes out unscathed. It looks like Mrs. Wood isn't impressive at all. She doesn't even realize she's stepping into a lion's den. Winnie Green That night with Yves. After we slept together, I was pregnant. Logically speaking, he must be the father of the child. Cici, I have something to tell you. I also have something I want to tell you. But you go first. Okay. Can you come help me at the office? I, Why do you want me to go? You're my wife now. I'm also part of the Wood Group. I've thought about it. You should come to the company early. It's best to familiarize yourself with the situation. And once you get busy, you won't spend all day thinking about sleeping. Oh, by the way, you were about to tell me something, what was it? You seemed so secretive. It's nothing much. Alright, it's settled then. We'll head to the office together tomorrow. Hmm. Being pregnant means you can... Going to work while pregnant. Become a hardworking and dedicated working mom. Be a role model for the baby. Hmm. Then I want to be a great role model. Working while pregnant might... What? Being pregnant at work... Could get you let go. No way. Then I have to keep it a secret for now. Otherwise, how could I being an example for my baby? I'm pregnant. D*mn it. It must have been from my last spell. It caused her good fortune. Hey, Master. I said, wait until you've had the baby, then Divine Elixir will be yours. If you're calling now, to rush me, there's nothing I can do. This is what I wanted to talk about. I'm pregnant. What? Are you serious? Yeah. The pregnancy test shows two lines. That means I'm pregnant, right? Congratulations! Then, as agreed, Master, I'll head to the mountain to get Divine Elixir now. Hey, wait a minute. Why? Master, You're not going back on your word, are you? Hahaha. How could I go back on my word? I mean, I'll personally bring it to you down the mountain. You're expecting. Why go to all that trouble? Alright, hurry up. Who's out there? Cici, is something wrong? Oh, it's nothing. Master, I might have heard wrong. Oh. You're pregnant. It's normal to be on guard. Cici Hall. Your child's life. And Divine Elixir. I'll take both. Pregnancy test sale! I heard from someone that if you have irregular periods, you can use this little stick to check. One line means you're not pregnant. Two lines mean you're pregnant. Two lines, I'm pregnant! I... Cici. You've been affected by June Smith's magic. Take a moment to calm down. I... No, it's not. Hear me out. Do you still feel like talking now? It smells amazing. Cici, Or maybe, I could be like before again. Should I just sleep downstairs again? Aren't you downstairs right now? What exactly happened last night? Why do I feel like there's something in my stomach, like there's something extra? You're up so early. Mm-hmm. What happened last night? Last night, we slept together. We slept together every night, do we? This time isn't the usual kind. It's the type, that makes our relationship, more intimate. I don't get it. Anyway, I don't remember what happened. But I keep feeling like something seems off somehow. Why are you touching your stomach? Are you feeling a bit uncomfortable? Nothing much. I just feel kind of weird. Oh, by the way, are you alright? Why would I be worried? Last night, I was affected by June Smith's sorcery. I couldn't contain my internal power. I was worried I'd accidentally hurt you. I didn't do anything out of line, right? You didn't. Last night was just a spur-of-the-moment thing. Let's just be more careful from now on. One month later It's odd, that this month, my period hasn't shown up yet. For years, it's always been right on schedule. Maybe I've been over-training lately, which has disrupted my internal balance, and that's affected my cycle. Don't even think about it. Why can't it work out? It's just about having a baby, right? Come on. Having a baby. It's not as simple as you think. Then why don't you tell me? How do you make it happen? Ever since I started practicing my skills, nothing can being a problem. In any case... Anyway, as for this matter, it can't be forced. Hey. Yves. Yves. Since you're unwilling to be with me I'll resort to using a charm spell to make sure you and I make it irreversible. Then we'll see if you can still back out of it. Hiding here won't work... What's the matter? Uh-oh... What are you plotting this time? Don't leave! Cici. Come with me to the bedroom. Cici. What are you doing? It's alright. The baby will be born eventually, anyway. Oh, by the way. How far along are you now? I have no idea. Your wife isn't pregnant. What do you mean? Could it be possible that... She had an eye injury before. And that led to a miscarriage? That shouldn't have happened. There's never been any pregnancy. Cici. How did you find out that you are pregnant? That's what grandma said. How did she know? She noticed that I love sour food. Then I overate and felt nauseous. And I haven't gotten my period. So she concluded that I was pregnant. You haven't gotten your period? Yeah. I haven't taken time off even when I was in the mountains. This... A period isn't that. Oh. So a period means menstruation. I come every month, and I'm always on time. So, with other men you were with, when you were intimate, did you use any protection? When I grow up, I've only slept with one person. I? This is all a big misunderstanding. Oh, and by the way, I'm not pregnant. Does that mean I can't have babies? Hmm. The master said, if I have a child, only then will he give me Divine Elixir. What should we do? There's nothing more we can do about it. How about we have a child? Just be honest with me. Hmm. Yeah. Oh no. I barely managed to get your eyes treated. Now Divine Elixir is gone. What are we going to do now? Alright, it is what it is. As long as your eyes are alright. I won't have any regrets. No way. I need to find my master to get some more. Master. I want to go up the mountain to find you. Get some of Divine Elixir. Oh. Go up the mountain? No. I gave it to you last time is plenty. Oh dear. Didn't something unexpected happen? It won't be a hassle this time. The junior apprentice brought it down. I'll go up the mountain to get it personally. Hey, hey, hey. Don't. Why? Master. Don't you want to see me? Uh, why would I not? Uh, the master wants to wait until you have a little disciple to give you Divine Elixir all as a congratulatory gift. Alright. As long as she has a child, she definitely won't be thinking about running up the mountain again. So, what do you think? What did your master say? He said I should wait and receive it after I have the baby. Divorce her. Hmm. I'm or that woman. Of course, you can only pick one. Why are you hesitating? That woman. She's just a country bumpkin. What's so special about her? Marrying me is a blessing for you. I suggest you should look in the mirror more. Cici is hundreds of times better than you. You! If you want her to see again, then follow my instructions. Divorce her. There's no need. Cici, how did you get here? Cici Hall. How does it feel to be blind? I'm giving your husband a chance to save you. Cici, your vision matters. Please listen to him. Let him come to me. I'll give you back a pair of eyes that can see. You! Cici, you can see now! What? Yeah, I can see! Great. Then I'll make you blind again. Are you trying to make your Smith Group collapse directly? Cici Hall, just you wait. That's fantastic! You can see again. Yves, did you use the Divine Elixir for me. It's over. I can sense my internal energy channels. They're all out of balance. The master said before, this is the inner demon. Cici. Hmm. You're going through the cabinet. What are you searching for? Just looking for something to eat. Her eyesight, probably hasn't come back yet. She can't see me. Lucky I conquered the inner demon. June Smith, what brings you here? I'm representing the Smith Group. I'm here to discuss a partnership with you. Have you forgotten what you did to Cici? I haven't dismantled your Smith Group yet. It was already a concession to Mr. Smith. That was my final act of mercy. I can enable Cici Hall to regain her sight. Are you for real? But I have a condition. What is it? Divorce Cici Hall. Then marry me. You have some nerve. You just had to mess with the Wood family. What's there to be afraid of? Our Smith family is well-established in G City. We can hold our ground. Are you lost your mind out there training on the mountain? Smith family, that has made it this far, and still reaping the rewards, thanks entirely to the Wood family not coming after us. But now, because of you, the Wood family wants to, completely shut us out. The Smith Group is on the brink of collapse. What? Do you realize now that you made such a big mistake? I just wanted to get revenge on that woman. I really didn't see this coming. The only option now is for you to marry Yves Wood. Try to earn his forgiveness. But, he's already married. Then be his mistress. In any event, you must resolve this dispute. Yves. Are you done washing up yet? You still need to help me out later with the massage. Almost finished. How did I recover so quickly? I've regained my sight already. Normally speaking, without the aid of Divine Elixir, just relying on my own internal energy, It would take at least a year and a half, to fully regain my sight. Could it be that... Hmm. Why can't I find it? Oh no. I forgot to bring in the towel. Cici Hall. Can you help me get... What's wrong? Oh, it's nothing. Anyway, she can't see me. I'll go out to get the towel. It should be fine, right? Why can't I find it? Where's Divine Elixir? Forget it. Even though I can't see anything. I'm enjoying life. There's always someone looking out for me every day. However, I still think I should reveal that my vision has returned. Let him know. Oh, speaking of which, You don't know? Hmm. How could you not know? Do you have more than one man? If the baby is born, would you be willing to be the dad? I... I owe you a favor. I... can be the child's father. Oh yeah! The medicine isn't completely applied yet. Where did you put the medicine? You're totally spoiling me. Right here. Hey, it's reversed. It's really reversed. Oh. Why did I hear that I'm being a dad to the child? You'd be so happy. Yeah, exactly. I feel like you would be a great dad. I'm going to take a call. Hmm. Tell me. Mr. Wood, we've already found June Smith's identity. She is the heiress of the Smith Group. Use all of our resources, completely suppress the Smith Group. Yes, Mr. Wood. Hey, dad of the kid, I'm hungry. I'll whip up something for you right away. Something to eat. Yeah. Alright. Wait for me here. I want some roasted chicken legs. Okay. Is it done yet? Coming right up! Okay. Open your mouth. Ah. Mmm. Take it slow. And there's more. Also oysters. Oysters? Don't rush. Ah. Don't bite the chopsticks. It's really delicious. Give me everything else. I put it in the bowl in front of you. I'm so stuffed. Next, you should help me with my bath. What? A bath? Be careful. Where did you bump yourself? Oh my, sweetie. Didn't I tell you to stay in bed? Why did you come out? Staying cooped up in the room all day. It's so boring. And my eyes will recover soon. But we don't know when they will fully recover. How about... I give you the rest of Divine Elixir. Oh no! No chance. We shouldn't waste it. It still needs to fix your eyes. Hurry and take a seat. Then, let's start with the regular medicine. Alright? Come over here. Rest your head on my lap. You did this because of me. Even if Divine Elixir is really precious, I still want you to have it. Are you ready? I'm on it, I'm on it. Even though my eyesight isn't good, when I'm with him, I still feel very at ease. On my way. Oh, by the way, about the baby, I'm not going to make a fuss anymore. A baby? What baby? Of course, your baby. Oh, okay. Grandma mentioned that I... I got pregnant. Who's the father of the baby? I have no idea. Exchange my eyes for it. That's right. Would you dare? Otherwise, I might just have to destroy his eyes that you struggled so much to heal. Cici. Don't agree to this. At worst, I'll go back to being blind. I'm already used to it anyway. I'll do it. Cici, what are you saying? It doesn't matter to me. What do you mean? Don't sacrifice yourself on my account. Yves, we agreed on this. You sleep with me. I'll help you with your eyesight. Now, you have already sleep with me. So I must fulfill our agreement. Help you recover your eyesight. That's really moving. Becoming blind. Cici. Cici. For a man, you'd go blind. You woman, that's truly foolish. After that, it's going to be your eyes' turn. Protect Mr. Wood. Consider yourself fortunate. Mr. Wood, Hal, look into the background of June Smith. This vendetta, I must avenge. Yes. If you don't want him to lose his sight again, come over here right away. Don't worry about me. Stay where you are. What did Mr. Wood say? He mentioned being captured by the witch June Smith. She also told me not to rescue him. Witch? Yes. While she was honing her skills, she veered onto a dark path. None of you are a match for her. But her abilities are still beneath mine. Then hurry up and rescue him! That's right. Without Yves Wood, how am I supposed to sleep with him? I'll arrange for someone immediately. to track down Mr. Wood. There's no need. I can sense her presence. Then I'll drive you. Shall I take you over there? So, it really is you. Do you actually dare to come here alone? Cici, get out of here quickly. This is a trap. Be quiet. This is between her and me now. June Smith. You can't still be hold a grudge, because back then I exposed that you stole my master's Divine Elixir, do you? If it weren't for you. I would have had Divine Elixir long ago. And mastered divine skills. Just because your one word. Master gave you Divine Elixir to treat this man's eyes. In that case, Cici Hall. Are you willing to use your eyes to replace his? Hello? This woman actually has the nerve to hang up on me. She's not coming. Just forget about it. Ma'am, have you seen Mr. Wood? He went into the parking lot this morning, and after that, he's been unreachable. He hasn't come back either. Oh, by the way, I just got a call, saying he's being held hostage. What? And then? Then I hung up. Isn't this obviously a scam? They're definitely trying to scam money. I just don't believe it. What are you doing? Look. He's calling now. Oh, that's great! Please answer it! Hello, Yves Wood. I heard you were kidnapped. It's about your husband. I kidnapped him. Cici Hall, listen closely. This is June Smith. You probably still remember. who I am, right? If you don't want him to become blind again, come here immediately. Yves What is this place? Your eyes are really beautiful. It's a shame. June Smith, what exactly do you want? I couldn't succeed at your place before, I wanted Cici Hall that woman to see for herself how I took her man. But I don't know, if she's actually clueless or faking it? that she seems completely unfazed. So, she's your target? Not exactly. And your eyes. Your eyes have absorbed Divine Elixir's essence. If it's extracted, and refined, it can achieve the power equal to Divine Elixir. But right now, I want to get rid of Cici Hall first. What do you have coming straight for me. Shh! Hold your horses, I'll deal with her first, then I'll come for you. Hello, who's this? Cici Hall, your man is being held hostage, he's in my custody, if you want to rescue him, you must come immediately! Unknown The master told me, that unknown numbers, are just scam calls. Grandma, can you say that again? You want to hear it again, right? Your wife. Cici Hall. She's pregnant with your child. Our Wood family will have descendants. I clearly didn't have sexy with her. How did she get pregnant? Could she have another man? And is she carrying someone else's child? Mr. Wood, where should I place this sparrow-tongue pine? Take everything away for me. Do you think this place is still lacking greenery? Cici has been complaining all day. About wanting to sleep with a man. Turns out she's already taken steps. I was misled by her innocent facade. But maybe it's just a misunderstanding. Cici Hall. What grandma mentioned, Is it actually true? What exactly did grandma say? About the pregnancy. Correct. She said I've been craving sour food. I feel nauseous. I missed my period. That suggests I'm pregnant. I'm heading back now. Wait for me. Let's clear this up face-to-face. Oh my! That's wonderful! Our Wood family can finally continue the family line. Grandma. You've been holding my belly. What are you up to? Oh I want to greet my great-grandchild and say hi. Great-grandchild? Your great-grandchild Is in my tummy? Of course. You're pregnant and going to be a mom. Pregnant? Cici, what do you feel like eating? I'll go get it for you. Now's the time to boost your nutrition. Then I want some roasted chicken legs. Braised pig's feet. Spicy duck neck and roast goose. Stewed lamb. Alright, alright, alright. Grandma will get it for you. Thanks, Grandma. Wow. Wow, I didn't know being pregnant could be this great. No more worries about food. I need to quickly tell Yves the good news. What's up, Grandma? Your work efficiency is really fast. Grandma, what are you talking about? Still acting, huh? Cici is pregnant. What? Why does this snack taste so bad? My dear granddaughter-in-law. Grandma, you're here. Cici. Were you just about to throw up? If Grandma saw you, that would be kind of embarrassing. There's nothing to be embarrassed about. Grandma has been through it too. Lately, have you been craving sour things? Yeah, lately I've been eating too much. It's perfect to have something sour. Just a little something to whet the appetite. Could that be from overeating? So, there's good news then? Good news? Grandma is asking you something. How long has it been since it came? Which are you talking about? You know, that one. Your period. Your period. What Grandma's referring to is. Does she mean a vacation? I'm up in the mountains. I practice my skills daily. I've never taken time off. I haven't had a break. Well, you need to untie me first. Oh. So, last night, where was June Smith? She, last night, she wanted to sleep with you, but it didn't happen, because I came back. So it didn't happen. What? What's wrong? Why are you getting all worked up about this? What's going on? Are you saying I almost ended up in bed with June Smith? Intimate? What kind of involvement are you talking about? You and her just had your clothes loose, were lying together in bed, down in the valley. Would you call that being involved? Did you notice? Aren't you getting jealous? Feeling jealous? I don't like feeling jealous. I prefer things that are sweet. I had something to drink last night. After she poured me the water, that's when the problems started. I realized she had drugged me. Hey? Mr. Wood, you finally made it. I looked into the matter, regarding the housekeeper who replaced Ms. William. There's an issue. Just as I expected. Mr. Wood, what's our next move? How should we proceed? Investigate. Got it, Mr. Wood. It's just about sleeping, right? Do we really need to make such a fuss about it? What's the matter? You shouldn't be with me. Explain this to me. What is going on here? You don't remember anything. Let me help you remember. It's really hot. Cici. It's so loud. Can anyone get any sleep around here? Cici, I want something. What do you want? I want you. What do you want from me? Be more specific. Stop nudging me. What do you want from me? Be clear about it. Cici. Enough! You didn't finish what you were saying. And you're keeping me awake. Now I can finally sleep well. I'm going to sleep. So what? So later, you can sleep with him again. Hey, when you leave, remember to turn off the light for me. Thank you! Mr. Wood, about the nanny from yesterday... Ma'am, may I know where Mr. Wood is? I have something urgent to discuss with him. He's in the bedroom sleeping. Mr. Wood. Look away! Don't you have something urgent to do? Are you here to see him? Why aren't you going inside? It's not a good time right now. Ma'am, you and Mr. Wood really know how to have a good time. Cici Hall, come over here. What's the matter? Mr. Wood, Please don't. Mr. Wood, Mrs. Wood will notice. Mr. Wood, Mrs. Wood. It was Mr. Wood who pulled me into bed. I couldn't do anything about it. What are you doing? Is this woman really asking knowingly? At this moment, you're probably enraged. As you can see. Mr. Wood wants to be intimate with me. He wants to be intimate with you. What you're saying is. He wants to be intimate with you. Yes. I'm aware of this. It's inappropriate. But I as well. Can't hold back Mr. Wood. Oh, I understand. Ma'am. You really mustn't blame Mr. Wood. Even though Mr. Wood and I. Have mutual affections. But you're the legitimate wife. Hey, why would I be mad at you? You're a witch, right? She actually identified me. You're just like me. Want to use men for your own ends. To boost your powers. Am I right? Boost your powers. What's this woman talking about? Are you making a dig at me? But this bed... For the three of us to sleep in. It's not big enough. Is this woman being this extravagant? Ma'am, are you implying that you don't care? Care about what? Aren't men just there to satisfy needs? Am I feeling sleepy? Mr. Wood. I'll take you back to your room to rest. I'll stop eating right here. I'm going home. Bye. I finally kept her occupied. Now Miss Smith should be sleeping with Yves. Truly sparkling eyes empowered by Divine Elixir. If I can take them, I'll obtain the power boost of Divine Elixir. By then, no one will be a match for me. You came back just in time. Cici Hall! I want you to see with your own eyes how I take your husband away. Later, I'll find a chance to take his eyes. What are you doing? Mr. Wood. Your clothes are soaked in sweat. I'm taking them off to wash. Mr. Wood, please don't do this. Mr. Wood. Mrs. Wood will see us. Mr. Wood! Who are you? Hello, I'm the new housekeeper from the housekeeping agency. Where's Ms. William? Ms. William is ill, so I'll be filling in for her temporarily. Mr. Wood, please, could you give me this chance? I really need this job to pay for my mother's medical bills. Alright, you can start your job right from this month. Has the agency told you our family's specific info? Yes, I already have a thorough understanding. Come in. Hi there, for just ten dollars, eat chicken legs til your heart's content! Grilled chicken legs! I'll take ten. Why isn't Cici back yet? Mr. Wood. Thanks. Like the erotic painting, I'll sleep on top, and you underneath. I... Whatever makes you happy. Good night. Miss Smith. I never expected that painting is worth a fortune. Who bought that painting? It was Yves Wood of Wood Group. And his wife made him buy it. I think her name is... Cici Hall. What's her name! Her name is Cici Hall. So that woman also descended from the mountain. Back then up on the mountain, I should have easily got the Divine Elixir. But, due to her, I was cast out of the sect, ending up on a dark path. Cici Hall, I'll take back everything that should've been mine. Divine Elixir? I've heard about it. Cici Hall got that from her master. She meant to use it to treat Yves' eyes. No wonder that blind guy can see now. Rumor has it, organs healed by Divine Elixir are akin to the medicine itself. Cici Hall. Your man, and your man's eyes. I'm gonna take them all. June Smith Applying Divine Elixir on my eyes everyday like this really can completely cure them? Exactly. Just keep applying it every day, and with my inner strength, not only will your eyes get healed, but they'll also become very precious. Precious? What do you mean? Time's up. What are you... What on earth are you wearing? What's the matter? My junior told me that I should wear sexy PJ and these black stockings when sleeping with you. Sexy? Black stockings? So you want to be on top? Or on the bottom? What? Cici Hall. What exactly are you planning? I wanna sleep with you just like they do in those erotic portraits my junior drew me. Seamus Young. Cici? Where's the medicine master gave me? This is the Divine Elixir. Hey! Master said to use it sparingly. Got it. Hey. What now, Cici? Master mentioned that my way of being with men isn't right. I asked him about it. But he wouldn't explain. Can you tell me where I'm going wrong? Hey, Cici. You're a girl, so I shouldn't discuss this with you. Tell me or not? If you don't, I'll just follow you back and ask the master. No, don't! Alright, I'll tell you. Oh my, I'll draw it out for you. Then you should understand it. Alright. Here's the erotic painting I drew for you. It's guidebook about how to be with men. But why do the man and woman in this painting both naked? The man is on top of the woman. Can you sleep like this? Uh, Cici, if you don't want to be underneath, then try this way. This way, you'd be on top. Oh. So this is the right way! This is a masterpiece by Master Young. What? Was that just now... Master Young? Hmph. Truly ignorant and arrogant. Cici. Your junior is Master Young? That's right. I'll offer two hundred million for this painting. Would you sell it to me? Two hundred million? Sir, I'm not selling this painting. Could it be that he wants to ask for even more? That's so greedy. Do you think the price is too low? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. If you like this painting, I can gift it to you. But before that, I need to get my wife's approval. After all, buying this painting was actually all her idea. I don't mind. If you'd like the painting, I can have my junior draw more. I didn't expect have such a broad vision, but also to have such an open-minded wife. Truly an ideal couple, and a great match! I won't take your painting for free. As a token of gratitude, I've decided to assign the project south of G City to the Wood Group. Thank you, sir. The project in the south is valued at almost a billion. Sir. How can you hand over such an important project to a blind! It's unclear who the blind one truly is. He's not blind? Sir, this way please. Let's discuss it in the private room. Here are too many unrelated people. Let's go. Cici. I wanna stay here to eat. I'm in for 100 million. She... Cici. Do you realize what you're doing? I'm assisting you in buying this painting. No need to thank me. Do you understand that it could be worthless? Mr. Wood, what a great wife you've got! But don't you take back your words. She's my family. Her words of course count. This time, you hit the jackpot. My junior's paintings are quite valuable. Junior? Turns out birds of a feather flock together. Cici Hall. Seems you're blind, too. Nobody would want this garbage painting even if it were free. And you're wasting 100 million on it? What a joke! Rough folks don't dig fancy stuff. You... Master Albert Master Albert, President of Commerce Chamber of G City? Why is he here, too? Master Albert is a globally renowned master appraiser. Could it be that tonight's auction has something he's interested in? Who bought this painting? It was that blind man. He spent a hundred million on that trash. He's not just blind, but also foolish! Outrageous! This is a masterpiece by Master Young! Sorry about that. I can't see. I was just looking for a chair. You! The chair is right here. Sit down please. Okay. Since you're blind, why are you at the auction? Isn't it a shame for those paintings? Hahaha. Owen. That's quite a funny joke. Hahaha. Don't you dare make fun of Mr. Wood. This is Leo Fox, CEO of Fox Group, a rising business star. All the companies are eager to work with his group. They'll prosper if it works. Mr. Fox, you've arrived! Mr. Wood. These people look down on others. Rest assured, I can be like your eyes, and help you bid for the most valuable painting. Thank you then, Mr. Fox. No trouble at all. This time, I really must give you some proper help. Owen. I heard that tonight, Master Seamus Young will be here, too. Is that true? Yes, it is. But I have never seen him in person. At tonight's auction, all the attending artists will improvise paintings. He is part of the participants. As long as I can recognize his artwork, and purchase it, I'll make a handsome profit! You've got a keen eye. You can surely spot his painting. Let's welcome the first artist to the stage. Seamus Young? I've never seen this painter before. Look at him, so nonchalant. He can't be Master Young. The first work, the &quot;Ink Landscape,&quot; auctioned off for 100 million. Ranna. Can you make out what this painting is about? Isn't it just ink on blank paper? Could this be worth 100 million? Exactly. Just a low-grade painting. I wouldn't take it even if it were free. But, this suits my plan just fine. Mr. Wood, this ink wash painting is truly a feast for the eyes. The depth variations of the ink are really a marvel of craftsmanship. In the contrast between light and dark, it seems to hold endless mysteries. It's an unparalleled masterpiece. Since you said so, I have to get it with 100 million. Bid on it now, and its future market value will surely increase tenfold. Didn't see that coming, did you? Yves Wood. Leo Fox is with me. If you buy this piece of trash for a hundred million, those reporters positioned by me will come flooding in to document your blunder, and then your group will be the butt of jokes. Leo deliberately described this painting as some masterpiece. They must be setting me up, trying to embarrass me. No wonder when I worked with him before, our projects together always got leaked. Looks like I've figured out the source. It's time now to walk away from buying the painting. I'm in for a hundred million. Leo Fox Cici Hall, you hillbilly. You actually came wearing flip-flops? Don't you realize what kind of event this is tonight? What's wrong with flip-flops? They're super comfy. Cici, you don't qualify to attend. So quit making a fool of yourself here! Just go back home! Seriously, can anyone come to this auction now? Do they even have any cash? Maybe they come here just for free food. She's from my Wood family, do you think she deserves to be here? Just ignore them! Let's go! Whoa, whoa! Move aside! You pesky brat! There're a lot of delicacies here! Let's go! You wanna stir up trouble or what? What do you think? Looks great, doesn't it? You... You're not still not satisfied, are you? Forget it, I'll match the clothes myself. Oh, by the way, for tonight's auction, get my cane ready. Huh? Mr. Wood, can't you see now? Others don't know I've already regained my vision. At this auction, I plan to pretend to be blind to see the true colors of those partners who covet my family. Got it, Mr. Wood. I'll get the cane ready for you right away. Auction Gala for Famous Paintings and Antiques Oh, Ranna, you said you landed a wealthy fiance. Where is he? How did you plan for him to meet us on such an occasion? Mom, tonight is the auction for world-famous paintings. All the top investors will be attending. My boyfriend is the cream of the crop. He's the investment manager at the Smith Group. Anything he invests in is guaranteed to make a profit. Really? Yeah. That's wonderful! Honey, Tony. Tony, this is my mom. Hello, Madam. This is our first meeting. I'd like to gift you a string of premium crystals. This... It must be worth over two million. Hahaha. This amount of money is nothing to me. At tonight's auction, anything I set my eyes on will yield a tenfold return on investment. Oh my. Being with you, Ranna will definitely have a good life. Haha. Tony Lawson Hello, who is this? Master, it's me. Cici. How have you been doing down the mountain? Master, as you told me, I married that guy and we slept together. Why hasn't my power increased greatly? Um, well, you must be sleeping in the wrong way. Isn't sleeping just about lying down? Cici, you've grown up. For some things, you need to figure them out by yourself. I can't tell you everything. Master, have you never slept with a woman? I slept with many women when I was younger. No wonder your power is so great. So, can I also sleep with many men? Then, my power will become as strong as yours, Master. Hey, hey, hey. You can't do it. One is quite enough. Oh, Master, I'll come up the mountain and get some Divine Elixir from you. Hey, don't come. Why? What I mean is, your junior Seamus is going down the mountain, and I'll ask him to bring it to you. Haha, no need to go up the mountain. Remember, don't go up the mountain. Okay. Finally, I can enjoy some peaceful days on the mountain. I can't let this girl ruin it again. Mr. Wood. This is the invitation to tonight's auction gala for world-famous paintings. Representatives from all big families will also attend. Additionally, Seamus Young, the renowned artist, will also be there. Hoping you have kids soon. Do you really not understand this kind of thing, or are you just pretending not to? My eyes... Why did my vision suddenly blur just now? I forgot to tell you. Your eyes haven't completely healed yet. So, my restored vision is not permanent. That's correct. With my current limited power, I can only expel the murky energy daily, to maintain your vision. That's it. There's no miracle in the world. It's okay. I can see things now. I'm already satisfied. Too bad I didn't ask my master for the Divine Elixir before coming down the mountain. Otherwise, his eyes could have been completely cured. Rest assured. As long as you sleep next to me every day, I can help you cure your eyes. Alright. Thank you. Well then, if you want to thank me, your chicken leg... I'll give it to you. From now on, I'll buy you as many chicken legs as you want. Yay, that's awesome! Wow, you young ones really can't wait. Grandma, it's not the kind of sleeping you're thinking of. And no precautions. That's good to hear! Grandma, we really just sleep together. You're adults now. Don't be shy. I know it all. Anyway, your eyes can see again. It's the best thing I've heard. From this point on, your task is to make sure I have a great-grandchild soon. Alright, Grandma. Hope your wish comes true. I really didn't misjudge you, my dear granddaughter-in-law. Then, I won't bother you. You can enjoy your time together. Bye-bye, Grandma. You're leaving already, Grandma? But Grandma just said she wanted a great-grandchild. Was she urging you to have a baby? Don't worry about that. This kind of thing should happen naturally. Hoping you have kids soon. So she really meant just sleeping, nothing more. My chicken leg. Oh, my... The chicken leg is really tasty. Why do you look so exhausted? It's clear you didn't sleep well last night. Seriously, you're asking me that? My dear grandson. Your eyes can finally see. Grandma, you're here. Have a chicken leg. Good girl! You cured his eyes. I really need to thank you properly. No need, Grandma. Last night, I already slept with him. Come here! Come over! Oh. Since I became an adult, this is my first time sleeping with a man. What are you doing? You got me wet. Don't talk. I know it's your first time. Is this your first time sleeping with a girl? Yeah. So, do you think we should take some precautions? I forgot to buy some. I'll go right now. What are you buying? What I mean is, while you're sleeping, I'll create a golden light shield around you. Otherwise, when I fall asleep, my energy might accidentally hurt you. Oh. I see. What did you say you were going to buy? Nothing. Then let's go to sleep. I can see now. I can see now! Why did you turn your head? I still need to do a check. What number is this? One. Move your eyes along with my finger. Oh. Looks like you're recovering well. Hey, we're not done yet. I can already see, can't I? There's still a color vision test. What color is my clothing? White. What else? No need to say that, right? Just say it. Is something wrong with your color vision? Alright. It's green. Can I leave now? Hold on. Next, it's time to sleep. Huh? Time to sleep? Yeah, didn't you promise? As long as I heal your eyes, I can sleep with you however I want. Why do I need to soak in a bathtub to treat my eyes? Cici, what should we do next? Shh, don't speak. Close your eyes. The mind calmed, the core energy focused. The light gathered, the hidden ailments dispersed. With the spirit of the moonlight, activate the power to restore the vision. What's happening? Did we fail? It's okay. It's okay? Open your eyes to see if you can see. I can see now! Your eyes can be cured. Ah. What did you just say? I said your eyes can be cured. Don't joke around! Even the Medicine Sage is at a loss. Who else can cure it? I can! You? Yes. But I still need to take a closer look. Just sit down properly. Move a little that way. What are you doing? Stay still! I need to check what's under your eyelids. Strange. What's wrong? I always feel like there's something hard poking me. Hurry up and check my eyes! I've found the cause! Your eyes are filled with murky energy. But I can use my internal energy to force it out. If it's as you said, how long will it take for my recovery? About half an hour. Just half an hour? Cici, if you can make my eyes see again, you can sleep with me however you want. Got it, leave it to me! Then, take off your clothes now. What? Take off my clothes? I don't mind that, as long as he sleeps with me. Oh, young folks today are truly direct. Good. That's good. Grandma. What brings you here so late? I nearly forgot it. This is the medicated eye patch for Yves. It's not easy for me to get it from the Medicine Sage. Grandma. How many times have I tried already? It's completely useless. You can take it back. My eyes are beyond cure. I'm entrusting you to supervise him to use it. Alright then, I'll leave. I won't interrupt you lovebirds. Enjoy your evening. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. What are you talking about, Grandma? I'm leaving. Take it slow. You don't need to worry about what my grandma said. I'm going to rest. Wait a second. You haven't applied the medicine yet. You actually believed that. Yeah, Grandma entrusted this to me. Let go. No sleep until the medicine is applied. Fine, fine. Come lie down on my lap. Oh, right. Your eyes are really beautiful. I... Come on, hurry up. Your eyes... What's wrong with you again? Your eyes can be cured. Just a bit to the left. Oh, that's too much. Come back, come back. A bit more to the left. There's a streetlamp ahead. Careful, don't bump into it! We're here. This is so much bigger than the straw hut I lived in on the mountain! Quick, get me inside. Hey, slow down. Why is it so dark in here? Because I can't see anyway. Oh dear. I came at the wrong time. I didn't expect you two to be so affectionate, right after getting your certificates. Grandma. What brings you here? Of course, I came to see my granddaughter-in-law. You're really beautiful. Grandma, you're very beautiful too. You really know how to give compliments. My grandson has some issues with his eyes. Sometimes he has trouble getting around. Please don't be critical of him. I don't mind that, as long as he sleeps with me. I'm here. What's up? Ah. Nothing much, just... As you mentioned, I'm dressed just like you today. Hurry up and go inside. Or we'll be late. I'll support you. No need, I can walk myself. Let's go. Hey. I can't believe I'm seeing this! Come on. The photo on the marriage certificate looks great. It's a shame you can't see. You really know how to hit where it hurts. Now that we're married, where are we going? I'm going home. Hold on, I want to go to your house too. You? I refuse. Your refusal doesn't count. My master said getting married means living together, and living together means sleeping together. Indeed. Otherwise, it would be hard to deal with Grandma later. Alright then. I'll ask Hal to pick us up. But when my seniors got married, they carried the brides home on their backs. That would be so celebratory. Carry you? Miss, I'm blind, and I can't see the road. You want me to carry you? I can be your eyes. Let's head to our new home, go! Mr. Wood. Now you know what I look like, right? Back in the mountain, my master and seniors always praise me for looking so charming. Grandma. You little rascal, the Hall family said you turned Ms. Hall down. Don't come home if you don't get the certificate. Oh well, it's just about getting the certificate. Besides, I can't see how she looks. I won't have feelings for her. Even if she tries to sleep with me by then, I'll just be cautious. What do you think? We're getting our marriage certificates tomorrow. As for sleeping, we'll talk about it later. Good! Then my power will definitely be improved greatly. Power? Do you get what she's saying? I'm not too sure either. Anyway, dress a bit more formally to get the marriage certificate. Formal? What exactly counts as formal? What's she wearing right now? Mr. Wood, she's dressed in a green robe. Looks like a Taoist. Me? Just like me, dress a bit more formally to get the certificate. Oh, alright. Civil Affairs Bureau What's the matter? Why isn't she here yet? The Civil Affairs Bureau is about to close. I'm here! Evelyn Clark What just happened? Mr. Wood, are you okay? He's definitely fine. That golden light shield just now cost me several years of cultivation. Why are you here? Mr. Wood, you almost got hit by a car. Luckily, Ms. Hall saved you. Thank you. You don't need to thank me. If you had died, who am I supposed to sleep with? Hey, don't you know anything about shame? Why are you always mentioning sleep? Just sleeping, is it really that complicated? I can't sleep with a woman I don't know what she looks like. Oh, that's easy. What are you doing? Her brows and eyes are soft, her nose sculpted, and her lips tender. I truly wish I could see what she looks like. So you're that blind guy? What did you just call me? Oh, come on. I'm sorry, Mr. Wood. She just came down from the mountain, and is not familiar with the outside world. Please don't take it to heart. I'm telling you... What are you doing? You... Even though you can't see, you have a good figure. You can sleep with me. Sleep with you? Yeah. You're a girl. Is this what you think about all day? What kind of person did Grandma introduce me to? Hal? Let's go. Yes. Hey, Mr. Wood! Wait, don't leave! My younger daughter can also marry you. See what you've done! The bird has flown. The bird has flown, but there is still a chicken leg. Hey, you! So, he's the one I'm supposed to marry. I should hurry and pursue him! Mr. Wood, your grandma called again to urge you. I'd like some time alone. Don't come along. But... Watch out, Mr. Wood. My chicken leg! Can't you watch where you're going? I... Hey! Let me use it for a bit. You... Here, take it back. Give it to me. What's this? This is actually yours. Mr. Wood. Oh no! My chicken leg's all dirty. I was planning to save it for last. Hal, handkerchief. Yes, yes. Mr. Wood. You... Bring it over. She... The dirt won't come off, no matter how much I wipe. Forget it. Watch where you're going next time. I... Hal, where have you brought me to? A mental hospital? Mr. Wood, we're in the Halls' place. Mr. Wood? So you're that blind guy? Look at her, such a foodie. She probably doesn't know yet. That's good. No way I'm going to give up this opportunity of being rich. Oh, Cici. Do you know that the guy who's marrying you is blind? Blind? Yes. Now you definitely don't want to marry him, right? If you don't want to marry him, I, as your sister, can handle a bit of hardship and marry him for you. Oh, it doesn't matter if he's blind, as long as he can sleep with me. Ah? You're in such a hurry to get married, just to sleep with a man? Exactly. See, country folks are really desperate for men. I'm full. I need to go marry that guy. Hey! Mr. Wood. Yves Wood This car probably costs tens of millions. Wow. So handsome! Turns out he's actually blind. What's the point of being this handsome and rich then? Exactly. Mr. Wood, we are now already at the Hall family's place. But Mr. Wood, are you really going to marry a woman you've never met? Hal, look at me. Which woman do you think I've met? I'm sorry, Mr. Wood. What I mean is... Alright. I understand what you mean. But this is a marriage arranged by my grandma a long time ago. Since the company's not busy lately, I need to hurry up and get married. Then, Grandma won't constantly nag me. Let's go. Alright. Ranna Hall Ivy Fox Cici. Weren't you doing just fine in the mountain? Why did you decide to come down all of a sudden? Didn't my dad arrange a marriage for me before he passed away? I came down to get married. Mom. She wouldn't know that I'm going to take her place and marry Mr. Wood, so she's rushing down the mountain to stop the wedding, would she? Hal Allen Mom. How can she eat so much? This little rascal! Help! Hey, let me take a photo. Cici Hall Master, help! Cici, why are you peeking at Seamus taking a shower again? Master, she's not just peeking. She's also taking secret photos! You... Hey, you're a girl... You always say a girl should keep a distance from boys. But I'm just curious about why we're different. Why isn't my cultivation as good as my seniors? Moreover, we grew up together. What's the harm of me taking a photo? You... Master, you should talk to her. Alright, Cici. Lately, you've been peeking at your seniors and juniors while they bathe, putting me in a tough spot. But... Wasn't I just trying to enhance my cultivation realm? If this keeps up, there might be a trouble. If she stays here, she'll only cause trouble. Cici, as I've calculated, your love star is active, and you might need to get married to break through your cultivation level. Getting married? Yes. What is getting married? Well, marriage means being with a man, and sleeping together. Since I was little, I've been sleeping together with my seniors and juniors, but my skills haven't developed. No, no. Hahaha. Could it be that I need to sleep with you, Master? No, no, no. Not this kind of sleeping! Oh, Cici, you've grown up now. Your father once arranged a marriage for you when you were little. Now it's time for you to go down the mountain and get married. Go down the mountain. And get married. So, as long as I sleep with the man I'm supposed to marry, my power will increase greatly, right? Yes. Exactly. Hahaha. Only through the union of Yin and Yang can you harness the energy of nature. It's more effective than ten years of your cultivation! Master, I'm going down the mountain to marry that guy and sleep with him. Go for it. Yeah, see you. Keep going. No turning back. If someone marries this girl, his good days will be over. Cici's Master Seamus Young
