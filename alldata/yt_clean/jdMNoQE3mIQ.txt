- I just bought this private jet. And now it's crashed. It takes on average 31 to find the survivors of a plane crash. And now me and the boys in the middle of nowhere All right, let's assess - I see some water bottles. We're gonna get thirsty out here. You know how it is. - Oh, look, they really paid two pilots and they only need one? That's why your flight's so expensive. - Chris! - What? - I found snacks. - So just like a normal We're saving these for later. We gotta ration this. - But I'm hungry now. - We're gonna pool the - This takes layovers to the next level. - The only food and is what's typically These tiny planes really don't I think it's time we use some strategy. Half of us should go explore the area, and the other half should and building a shelter. - All right, let's all - The longer we explore, - Exactly. - We push it and we're Uh-oh. - It kinda works. That's what we want. - What is the objective of exploring? - I don't think exploring does anything. - Oh, well, when you put it that way. Does this not look like a movie scene? - This feels like we're - It really does. - Wait, especially with that dinosaur. - Oh, shoot. - Wait, is this our new home? This is epic. They made progress while we're gone. Doesn't look like there's much water. - I drink my four bottles, - You've been drinking waters? - I've been thirsty. - What happened to rationing? - I rationed these nuts. - Nice. - I'm a streamer, I'm not We've come back with so many sticks. Oh, it's scary in here now. Do you feel like you know I think we're lost. - Guys, I got a fire pit. Holy crap. Did you rip the engine off the plane? This is actually a perfect fire pit. You might not be the brightest, - I think I have enough wood to go ahead and get the firewood started. Look at that. - Chris is big braining right now, dude. - We are thriving, not just surviving. - I've got an idea. Tareq, give me the drone. Tareq brought this drone But what he didn't plan for is for me to tape the drone Bro, it's literally just trees. I wonder if Ludwig hears - He's terrified. - I hear a drone. - You do? - Is it more that way? This way. We might actually be lost. Karl! Chris! - All right. Still trees. Still trees. Wait, what is that? Oh, my God that's water. - That's water. Look what I found. - That's a river source. - Wait, where is this river? - Karl! - Is that Ludwig yelling? - Is that Ludwig? - Okay, Karl I'm having You go save Ludwig. - Ludwig just screams. - Karl! - Where is he? Is he in the forest? - Where are you? - Ludwig! - Karl! - Ludwig! - Karl! Karl! Oh my God. - Are you kidding? - That's like nothing. - These are good sticks. - That also wasn't even in the bag. - But I... - Watch yourself with that stick. - We need a meeting, Jimmy. Ludwig was lost in there and I find him with a bag - Man, that's actually a lot of wood. - It's a good amount of sticks. - He was out there for an hour. . - Here's the situation. This plane wing can fall at any point, we barely have any water left, and we haven't even built that helipad for the helicopter to land and pick us up when the time's up yet. I know everyone's about to go to bed, but I just remember we have a flare gun. - Help! - Oh. Wait, is it gonna come down? Oh, we're dead. Oh wait, nevermind. Another one! Ooh. Before you shoot our last flare, what if we actually need a flare? - Why would we possibly need a flare? - Apparently this drone So we decided to test something - Dude let me write a message in urine. - All right, we're ready? Write us a message in your pee. - I think I see it. - Yes, we see his pee! - You see it? I put my initials. - Yeah, we do. - We can see your pee. - I wanted to write, &quot;sub to MrBeast&quot; but I realized I was - You don't have enough, yeah. Oh, that's actually the first water bottle I've had in six hours. - Chris, are you hungry? - What do you think, Tareq? What kind of question is Not anybody has ate. - We're not even halfway and we're starting to go - The only thing in the air right now are these bugs. - Guys, I just realized we're gonna miss our connecting flight. - Guys, I just realized we're probably gonna miss - I'm not having fun anymore, bro. - This is taking lay over - It's 4:00 AM, I've gotten no sleep. It's freezing cold outside. I've gone from heat in like six hours. - How'd everyone sleep last night? - On the wrong side of the plane. - It got really cold so we all came over here - How much food do we have left? - None. - We have like 10 packs of nuts. - Is that the only thing? - As you guys remember when we saw a river over there. And see now we need to shower minus like, Ludwig. - I drink my four bottles. - I think we should go find the river. - To the river. Going to find a river You guys gotta remember The roots have been washed out by water, that means we're getting close. Guys, I think I hear it. Chris, the river did - We're almost there. - You guys wanna hear my Chris impression? &quot;Yo, it's right through here, guys.&quot; - I am actually seeing and I don't know if it's - I wouldn't drink out of this river - Boy, fishing poles. - Oh. - We did not put those I don't think this is to drink and bathe in. - No. - I have a headache and dehydrated. Chris is just gonna keep going. - We keep trekking off. - I think we just head back to the plane and just leave them. - Shower would have been nice, though. - Oh, what? Why in America's there just - Whoa. - How old is this Mountain Dew? - Whoa. - Oh my God. This thing's disgusting. Oh, there's wasps in here. - Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. - All right, let's jet, let's jet. - I got you. - Oh, we brought bug spray. - Run! - I've never been so excited - We're back! - Do you hear yelling? - I hear yelling. - What are you a river God? - I am a river God. That's why I have this staff. It gives me plus 18 intellect. You guys been being productive? - Chris, you're back. - Chris, who's that? I'm the river God. - I'm severely dehydrated. They need to pack more waters on plane for when you get in a plane crash. This is really hard to survive How does this compare - During the day was - How does this compare to - This is way harder. - Because in the wilderness - Almost like you need water to survive. - Is there actually a I don't actually trust that - It's officially been 30 hours, which means we have one more hour until the helicopter saves us. I have three layers of sunscreen on, four layers of bug spray. But that aside, we should build a place for the helicopter to land. - Go a little faster, - You wanna do it? - Why do I have to mow the grass? - We could burn the grass, 'cause then it'll just be a bare path. Now, theoretically, we should be able to burn the grass inside of where we did - This is a terrible idea. - So how are you making the H, Chris? - I'm using fire. - Fire! I took care of it. - I think now we're for them to land. - Bro, we ran out of water 10 hours ago. - I'm just excited to go - What? Come on, you had fun. Did you not? - It was a good time. - What? - With the exception of the lack of food, the lack of water, the lack - I'm tired. - It hurts to breathe. - I haven't had a drink in five hours. - Chris, are you hungry? - What do you think, Tareq? - Oh wait, do you guys hear... - Oh my God. - I hear it. Oh my God. - We gotta let him know where we are. Oh. - Hey! That's our rescue helicopter. That means that 31 hours is officially up. Here. - Right there. - On the H that I made. - Yes! Look at the trees! - Whoo! 31 hours in that stupid plane. I'm out here. Goodbye. I'm gonna go get some - We're Going Home! We're Going Home! - That just took layovers - To the next level. MrBeast, oh - I'll tell you this. I'll This is about to take - I swear to go God...
