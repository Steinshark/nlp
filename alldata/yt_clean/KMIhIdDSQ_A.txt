So you can say whatever you want and then I'm gonna translate I'll translate for you Can you introduce yourself in Korean? First meeting Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. You are so cute. Thank you. What's your name? My name is Charlee I am Niko Shinkawa. Niko? What a cute name. I am... Hong Eunchae. I am Sakura. My name is Jen (Huh Yunjin). - Nice to meet you. - Can I call you Sakura-chan? Eunchae unnie. (I am) unnie...! Handshake. Have you seen me before? Do you recognize me? Maybe? Maybe...? Yeha, do you know LE SSERAFIM? Yes. They are idols. Yes. I am a member of LE SSERAFIM. Really...? Yes! Wow. Are you an idol? I... You know LE SSERAFIM but don't know the members? Yes. Hmm... LE SSERAFIM is... 5-member K-Pop group, from Source Music. There are 2 Koreans and 1 American, and 2 Japanese. There are 5 members, and I am the last. LE SSERAFIM is a group that walks its own path, it is a cool group. So we took the phrase 'I'm fearless' and then we scrambled it up and then we made LE SSERAFIM. Yeha, do you get scared easily? Yes. I just don't like scary things. Things like ghosts? Yes. I hate them too. I don't know much about idols, but I know LE SSERAFIM. - Do you know? That feels great. Thank you. Do you know me too? Yes. I am excited. Do you know the song ANTIFRAGILE? Anti ti ti ti Yeah, I know! Anti... Fragile. Oh, you know it well. Awesome! It was on the lunch broadcast and such. - The song played. Is LE SSERAFIM famous at school? Well... In the future... We will work hard. Then later on, we will meet a Japanese friend and an American friend. Do you have friends of any other nationality than Japan? Have you made a lot of friends in korea? Umm... - Yes. How do you typically make friends? Are you the person who goes up to someone first? I sometimes say hi... I think at your age when I made friends, I was also the person who goes up first and says hi. And I think I just said... Do you wanna be friends? Oh, yeah. That's what I said. I was very active and I had a lot of energy. So I think I asked 'Do you wanna join? Do you wanna play?' I used to be very shy. First... I couldn't ask to be friends first. I was like... Do you want a candy? Like this... That's what I did. When going to school and then returning home, if we walked together we became friends. In my time, playing tag or green light, red light. Do you know Keidoro (Cop and Thief)? Yes. - You do? I did something like that... I also really like to do handshakes. Which kind did you do? Ones like this...? Wow. Can you teach me lemonade? I feel like I would remember it if you teach me. Lemonade Lemonade Crunchy ice Sip it once Sip it twice How do kids play with their friends these days? I play hide-and-seek - Do you play hide-and-seek? I played Halli Galli these days and I used to play drawing. I play Halli Galli with our members often. Are you good at that? - Maybe? Quickly, like this Isn't it hard to make friends? It's a bit hard. - It's okay. Do you go to a Japanese school? I see. Can you speak a bit of Korean? - Yes. - Yes. I can speak a bit too. What a relief. Then shall we talk in Korean briefly? Can you do it? - Hello. - Hello. I can understand a little Korean but it is kind of hard to understand. It's difficult a bit. I feel like what you say isn't important, it's your attitude and how you warm up to that person. You can speak a bit of Korean so try speaking in Korean confidently. Even if you are shy, if you try to talk, I am sure you can be friends. Yes. - I will do my best. Cute. Umm, also among LE SSERAFIM members There is a member who couldn't speak Korean well before. But since she talks a lot with Korean members She speaks Korean very well now Worried that they might not understand, rather than not saying it at all, I think it is good to keep talking. I started practicing how to be like friends. I usually have to take a deep breath and then try. So... If you meet friends today, just say like 'Do you want to be friends?' Do you want to...? It means 'do you want to?'. Then to make new friends today, - do you want to be friends? Do you want to try it? Konnichiwa, hi. Shall we try them? - Do you think you can do it? We are one team now. You are also part of LE SSERAFIM. You are also fearless. One team! Way to go! Then today, - let's do well as the same team. Thank you.
