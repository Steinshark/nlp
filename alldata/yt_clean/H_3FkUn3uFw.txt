During a walk in the forest, I heard sounds coming from an old tree lying on the ground Despite waiting for a long time, I didn't see any creatures going in or out. Even though I waited almost all day, the sounds from inside kept coming without stopping. As evening approached and it started to get dark, I got closer and looked with a flashlight and saw the babies. Some of the babies had died, and others were caught in an ant infestation. I felt compelled to take them. At first, I fed them a puree of egg yolk and dog food for two days. One of the babies hadn't even opened its eyes yet and was much smaller than the others. I dropped everything and immediately went to town, where I learned that I could feed them more comfortably with live mealworms. According to my research, the mother bird feeds her babies every two hours. I got mealworms, and they loved them incredibly. Before feeding them, I always tap on the jar to make a sound. Now they respond immediately to the sound of the jar On the 7th day, we are continuing very healthily and they have gotten used to me We all returned together to the forest house again, where they will grow healthier in their natural habitat. I designed a small box with holes to easily provide food, which will be a great solution until they grow up :) Their first encounter with soil The hoopoe bird (ibibik) will transform into an incredible sight in a few weeks My connection with hoopoe birds is growing stronger every day. I haven't let the smallest one out yet I'm doing everything in my power to make them happy birds, and I will continue to do so, ensuring they remain free in their natural habitat. They have become accustomed to poking their heads out of their nests in a row Every day, I take them out to the garden of their forest home at the same time for them to get their minerals After a certain period of time, they enter their nests on their own On the 16th day, they started flapping their wings and are trying to fly in a controlled manner when landing They have started foraging for food on their own now. Time to sunbathe! :) I needed to come to my bushcraft fairy tale house club in the forest, and I brought it with me. I couldn't find words to describe this tranquility; feel it as you watch... I returned to my forest home again. They have started flying now, and I didn't want them to fly in another area. Now they are hunting with ease. One of them has fully learned how to fly. The hoopoe birds' most distinctive and favorite characteristic is tossing their captured prey into the air with their beaks before swallowing it Today, the largest one among them started flying and perched on a tree. It's watching its surroundings in amazement but not coming down I waited anxiously under each tree it visited for hours, feeling truly worried. I've grown very attached since its infancy The largest hoopoe bird that flew away didn't return, and I keep thinking about it constantly. Only 4 birds were left now I think they will fly tomorrow. &quot;I couldn't sleep all night, and I kept checking the jar on the balcony repeatedly.&quot; &quot;And finally, it returned when it heard the calls of its first flying siblings, and this happiness is indescribable.&quot; &quot;Now all 5 siblings are together and flying. They spend their nights perched on tree branches and return to my window in the morning.&quot; &quot;Everything I imagined from the first day has come true. The wild hoopoe birds are flying, exploring, hunting, and returning to me.&quot; &quot;I could have easily accustomed them to my dogs if I wanted to, but to prevent them from getting harmed by other dogs, I mostly kept my dogs in their nests in the early days.&quot; Knowing the exact translation of this bee, it is called the Bear Bee in our region and its honey is very valuable, it is difficult to part with it. I consider myself a good parent from beginning to end with the idea of what a mother bird can teach. They are using every part of my house, and now this home is theirs, with no restrictions, no limitations. &quot;When they hear a different predator bird call or another sound, they all make this sound together.&quot; &quot;Due to the heat, I built a small terrace under a large oak tree, and when I go there, they come along with me.&quot; &quot;Imagine this: there's no one around but your dogs and wild birds that never leave your side.&quot; &quot;I spend the whole day with them, and even when I go for a walk in the forest, they are right behind me.&quot; &quot;They have more than repaid the efforts I've made over the past month, and I can't imagine this meditation could be any other way.&quot; &quot;Every morning around 6:30, they are all together on the balcony.&quot; &quot;I'll be waiting for your comments and support in the upcoming videos. See you next time!&quot; &quot;Every kindness has its inevitable reward.&quot;
