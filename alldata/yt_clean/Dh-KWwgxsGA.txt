I've been through dark times in my life I wish to help those who are still I want them to know there is still hope My friends told me that they won't I was very shocked I am Talia, co-founder of I have an elder sister I'm the middle child I had a strong case of I would yearn for my father's attention I might have demanded quite a lot of My father wasn't quite doting of me My mother would favour my brother Hence, I felt neglected I'm two years older than her Although two years is a small gap, we seldom talked to each other at home Talia was very reserved at home She was very quiet Therefore, we didn't confide much During her secondary school years, she became quite rebellious I was often punished in school... and the teachers would say Hence, for a long time, I had low self-esteem and was constantly This made me more rebellious I wanted to show them just how I believed that my mother gave up due to numerous call-ups to meet My siblings didn't cause trouble Over time, she stopped meeting the teachers That affected me even more, because I felt that she didn't So be it then The teenage Talia would seek attention to reclaim her sense of security When I was 14, I started Beers, spirits, and eventually, I also started to go to clubs My friends brought me to Those people were not of They were much older and were professionals I was young then... and would attract quite a lot of... attention from men I enjoyed having that kind of attention I was hooked I would hang out To drink, to smoke, and then eventually... taking drugs At that time, I desired a family of my own I wanted my version of romance and love Hence, I got married quite young I got married when I was 22 years old But unfortunately, we divorced I went back to the clubs, where I would and they would take care of me I was kind of aimless I had no proper job Eventually, I got bored of and sought new adventures in Hong Kong, When I was 28, I wanted to My boyfriend then gave me I used it to open two clothing shops My business went on for about four years I was lucky to have my sister's help in There was a period that She only appeared to close up the shop I helped out for a few years before I told her that after giving birth, I might not be able to She has to look after her child... and I wasn't keen on letting outsiders I had an idea I thought it was the brightest idea Why not open a KTV pub? Since I can handle liquor well why not combine I was 32 when I opened my KTV pub That period... was perhaps the darkest period in my life One of Talia's business partners While running her pub business, Talia's alcohol After running the pub for two years, I would have a minimum of two bottles of On top of that, there were numerous drugs Eventually, one day at home, life was just flowing out I had no energy to move at all I had an overdose Drug overdose caused Talia It was a miracle that I didn't die On the second day after that episode, I was very weak, but eventually, I recovered After this ordeal, I regretted having lived such I had enough of that After her close brush with death, She grew distant from her husband Her husband's affair to seek another divorce After ending her second marriage, I left the pub scene to learn to It was quite a strange choice Was I too old Talia was lucky to be hired by She studied and worked at the same time After that, she joined a social enterprise I wanted to help young girls I don't want them to make I wanted to guide them... on how to discover new opportunities Hence, I joined as a cosmetics instructor After a few years, Therefore, I took over I started up My name is Qara I am the co-founder of I first knew Talia I have prior experience in F&amp;amp;B Back then after my divorce, I had nowhere to stay Qara took me in... and it has been 15 years since A permanent resident of sorts I have been involved since I assisted in the administration I also developed the company's website After setting up the all-women halfway house, invited her to join their cause In 2014, I became a board member In 2019, I was promoted to I understand the problems I had a troubled history with and I saw the error in my ways Thus, I wished to help them navigate As an executive director, I conduct exit interviews for inmates These elderly women I would ask them this question - &quot;So, what are your future plans?&quot; They would reply that This is a very common answer I would ask what they were They would say... that in a halfway house, they still had a case worker their financial and other issues They had help Now that they're released for good, they still had many unsettled issues Hence, they had to confront these It's a headache for them To better help these elderly women, Talia stepped down from and started another social enterprise She has always been supportive as well as each project Seeing her transform from someone who was aimless, to where she is today, it has been a tough journey She is now helping others through So, I feel that... what she's doing is purposeful In order to set up after some discussions, Talia thought of engaging Qara's mother... to teach how to make traditional Teochew kueh My mother has been making kueh I received many good reviews Eventually, we tried selling them Customers began ordering online, This continued until 2019, when Ngee Ann Kongsi requested us Turns out that interest was strong We were encouraged by the results I became confident in our kueh Hence, I told Qara that... we've found a product that to support this social enterprise Qara agreed Once Talia had set the direction the next step was to convince My mother has always been keen to To also be able to help people was the cherry on the cake Thus, we decided to set up Just like how I'm supportive of Talia, She found this very meaningful She could share her knowledge about and also help others learn Once Talia's decision to start the associated challenges Capital has always been a challenge Initially, we relied on our savings For example, Talia had but she gave it up to fund the business I forked out the other half Then COVID-19 came Why do I say that? We became eligible for a number of which were quite generous We also have many supportive and helped us out as well My name is Caleb Yong I got to know them only during the pandemic I noticed that they actually employed So, I took an interest I saw that there is a good purpose which resonated with me I happened to have a little sum of So, I suggested that to help them get started With capital and a store secured, everyone began playing their part Talia worked at The Turning Point before One day she approached me to ask... if I can teach people some skills I told her to be mentally prepared, the road ahead is long and tough They would have to start work before dawn There are many factors at play here I told her to consider it carefully They decided to go ahead, I can support them from the back The store employed two workers to learn to make Teochew kueh I'm Azizah. I'm 56 years old I'm under the recovery programme I've been in F&amp;amp;B, cleaning services But this is the first time I learn how to My bosses - have been guiding me on how to make kueh and I have confidence in it My name is Shuang Di I'm 61 years old I was from the halfway house I was referred to work for them here The store also hired an elderly who was I am Ah Bern I make coffee here People like me who did drugs... face an uphill battle with heroin addiction There are ups and downs Sometimes, we would bump into old friends, or come into contact with drugs, which will cause us to relapse Though I had relapsed a few times, Talia and Qara never gave up on me They helped me and gave me opportunities There is direct access from our kitchen From my experience, they still need support after I feel that they should have such a place Our place doesn't merely provide We also get them ready to reintegrate The 10 hours they have each day, is very good for their recovery process For example, if they encounter we can immediately address them When we first applied, we didn't know We were delighted when we found out... because we could implement By staying here, firstly, it's convenient Secondly, Talia and the rest... prefer me to stay here there is less chance of It's better this way as they can After the second floor was renovated Talia and Qara moved in as well Moving on, we would like them to When they acquire the skill But, of course, good character and tenacity are ultimately I'm learning a lot So, perhaps when I move on to where I learn even more new things, and then who knows, I may open a store Talia and Qara's wish to help workers... become business owners themselves They have found a good location We are delighted to fulfil our goal of open their first shop My dream is to become a chef Now that I've obtained the necessary My boss is treating me well I have learnt a lot here Though their social enterprise is Talia still has her doubts There was once my friends told me this If they were me, they wouldn't even care I was very shocked Why did they think this way? This made me realize that... there are many in society on people like us Because they were not influenced They have not walked down They view drug offenders as They see them as people who fail to change They ask why I'm still helping them Even my own family members, my very young niece, she once asked me, &quot;Why do you care about them so much?&quot; This reaffirmed my belief that... these people truly need my help Working tirelessly day and night Talia is on the brink of exhaustion I have thoughts of giving up every day The work is indeed very tiring It's very physically demanding But if you can uplift one person, even if it's one in ten, Without our help, Hence, it is rewarding in this sense But frankly, it can be tiring, because we commit ourselves Never in my life have I worked yet I never felt more satisfied Subtitles: CaptionCube
