That kid thinks he knows you Then it couldn't have been much. And even if it was, I can't see how. Being a professional gambler, ...because I might play them sometime. That's what makes me so inquisitive. - That's natural. ...and all kinds of people - That makes sense. ...either their money or their You've heard of &quot;getting blood - Yeah. Two drinks. Two drinks. This is the way my luck's running. I can speak two languages, ...but I'm in a country I found that pretty women - What about the ugly ones? It's not as bad as I thought it'd be. Somebody once said: ...but believe everything she sings&quot;. - Who said that? What's the trouble with him? What's he saying? He disliked the way that man You see we want to be peaceful We may be here I can handle myself. - I'm sure of it. - He just said &quot;he was sure of it&quot;. It may not be as bad as you think. We can fish in the mornings, ...and we can play cards at night. - You might even get lucky. Fiske, you know what you can do You can tell my fortune. Anything you like. The Red Queen. What do you know. - What's she saying? Her husband is trapped in a cave-in. - She'll pay 1,000 dollars a man. Did you hear what I said? He just told us. I offered them a thousand a piece. I'll double it for any of you A man is lying out there hurt, - If that isn't enough... - But, why is it so high? I didn't put the price on it, I don't know what to do - I've got to get help or he'll die. Why will none of them go None of them will go out there. Are you? Ma'am, the thing I'm afraid off He says only fools go up there. He's going with her. - You said 2,000 dollars? - All right, I'll go. You? Madam, I can live anywhere ...but alone in this town. Meet me in an hour I'd like for one of you You. - Are we lost? We pass the face of that cliff. What's this all about? There's Indians here - What does it say? - What else? Isn't there another way - Not that I know of. How did you find this place? With a map from an old priest - He warned us against it. For God. A better reason that ours, Vicente's marking the trail. Do you think he'll want He just might want to get back How did you happen to be We came around the Horn The ship broke down and we - You came together? - So, you don't know each other? Look at her. Taking 4 men like us - She took what there was. The barrel was empty, - How far is this place? I wonder how she remembers - Maybe she's got a good memory. No, she's got a map. She takes it out, unfolds it, When she thinks no one's looking. - But you were. Look. You see that? Before this is over, Eating right out of her hand. Maybe it isn't the woman, Not you, Daly. Me. You telling me what to do? - Just this once. Nobody ever tells me All right. I don't think I like him. I don't think I like any part of him. - There's nothing more simple. I'm talking. You're right. A man should never Not if he cared for his life. But I'm a peculiar man. You followed me, If you want to know where You can tell the others too. Tell them, that without me And when you're lost in this country, Then you won't need that gun. You underrated me, Hooker. I don't think I will. It looked like a good thing. A woman leading you in a country where nobody goes - Go on. ...you were doing this A miserable little thing - Are you? I think so. I think anyone would care ...especially if it was Say, Hooker, ...before you became an idiot An idiot without any. Is he still marking up the way? I think he's memorizing it. Are you? Does he know she's wiped his marks? I doubt it. You'd think she'd get tired. She's like something hammered Now you, you're made out of leather. Vicente, volcanic rock. - And you? I think I'm the only - She's human. - Because of what's driving her. That man in the mine. It makes every mile Well, you sound almost We'll camp there for tonight. Not many hours old. - Some kind of a ceremony or ritual. Apaches. So what? This is a special month for them. - How do you know? It's from when they wiped out You know, back in that saloon ...but out here it's dwindling fast. Don't listen to him, it's a legend But he was here. Do you think they care about us? They killed those who took People who made homes People like us, who hunt for gold ...do you think we're worth killing? Maybe you're right when there were - But now... I hired you It might be a little dangerous, If a man's life isn't worth a risk, Go ahead. Tell me how much more. - What's eating her? Let's make the coffee. - She put you in your place. At first I thought she was ...who come along and fascinate men And now what? She tries and she knows why. Tell me some more It's an open season. - On what? What do you want? What you said about quitting You didn't mean me, I didn't come along for that. That's all they're after, And don't be afraid of them I'm with you, Leah. I know what's going on, It ain't the money with me, Take your hands off me. You animal! You scum! Go to bed. We got enough trouble - Is it? Is that all? What if I say it ain't all? - Say what you want. Yeah, I think I'll say something. I've had a gutful of you, And I'll say it Put that way, Daly. I've killed men like you before. Yeah. I know about you. You killed them for rewards ...when nothing could be done You shot them at tables Wherever their eyes were shut I know about you. I'll let you square yourself. Killing a man face to face. I'm telling you, Hooker. I'm telling you! I'm telling you! Stop it. Blame yourself. Don't blame Daly or me, - What do you think you're saying? And so do you. If you want to get where Here. Wash your face. You'll be all right. Don't think it hasn't happened You just didn't understand it. There's only one thing in her head. Nothing else. Now you know. Why didn't you kill me? I need you. You don't need anybody, Hooker. I will. We'll all need each other. Come on, now. You got everything fixed now? It'll hold for a while. You see how it is? Now she's got She's got you going unarmed ...a man she turned into an idiot. - A boy. I admired you enormously. Some day, like Salome, ...she'll have you bringing her - Or yours. Mine belongs to you. - And you know what they say. Two heads are better than one. Take one. Put it back. - Yours Si? - What's he say? Shuffle? Cut? Cut? - How far will it be now? We could ride tonight Only the horses don't ride. Do you want to tell me about him? - Tell you? Tell you what? He's a mining engineer. We prospected in California A map of this country, It was a boom town once. Everything except a church steeple In 3 hours they lost half of God - And they never went back? Indians? Yes, after the volcano - A place of evil spirits. - Do you? That's it. The town buried ...and the mine's on the other side. Let's ride. He's alive. He's all right. Here, take it easy. Be careful. I tried that We'll need timbers to support this. Here, try this. Hold up that end. - Use this for his feet. - Watch out when you lift his leg. There we go. Take him to the house. All right, get out. I want to try and fix his leg - I'll help you. Come on, let's go. Leave him alone. Don't talk. Don't try. You'll be all right. It was right there. - I kept missing... You... You... I'm here. You'll be all right. He will be, won't he? - He has a fractured leg. I don't know. He'll live. Heat some water and wash him. How bad is his leg? - I don't know. - Not sure. Maybe when he's stronger. He'll have to be carried on a litter, ...if he does go. What do you mean &quot;if &quot;? He may stay. He's got supplies here. Where's Daly? He's in the mine. I told him we'd be staying, He's crazy again. First it was the woman, He wants one or the other It could. - What will you do? How is he? He's sleeping. - Who's he? He fixed your leg. - Is it bad? I can. Just lie there. I've made you soup and coffee. I'll get it. You better stay off of - Where did you find him? Here, drink this. You found him. Just like that you found him. Just like that. A woman like her ...and coming back for me. - I don't have to. Days and nights in that black hole But I had time to think. And you know what I thought about? You and me. And I said to myself: &quot;She'll be back, And I knew then that none of it From the beginning to the end of it, And I knew what a fool I was ...and who made me that fool It was the gold, Leah. I was in love with you. How could I know that ...was someone to risk his life... ...to grovel, to dig? That's all I ever meant to you. A pick and shovel Yes, I wanted gold. I wanted all the things it can buy. Most people do. I didn't want it like this. Here, take this. - Why? - Who cares? You falling for it too? You're next. I don't follow anybody. You think I'm wrong. I think you talk too much. One thing, - I'll try not to. - What is? They're up there in those hills, They came to the door of the mine You know why they didn't kill me? Because they couldn't come up But they will for you and her Tell her not to worry about me. Tell her! Tell her! Vicente has got a bottle of mescal No, thanks. I wouldn't take it too seriously. He's had a bad time. No, he isn't. He's wanted And he finally said it. - Is it true? What is it to you? No one is all true to anybody - Some people are. I don't know. I don't move Like this one. What were you before? A sheriff. They're robbing you. - Did you think they wouldn't? When do you get yours? In a little while - Why do you say that? Up there in the hills. - Do the others know? They just want to get rich Let's go, partner. - Can you guide them back? Then get out of here tonight. I'll build a fire and move around. It'll fool them long enough - And Fuller? I thought you hated each other. I don't hate him. - He's trying hard to hate you. You took him too far. You made a coward of him It could happen to any man - Any man? There's gold in that shack. It's yours. I'll show you ...if you take him with you. I'll tell them. - Who's giving the party? They're inheriting a fortune I hope they don't get tired - What'd you tell him? ...you can go up and string - They're up there behind us. Indians. - Fuller. - He's crazy. He's out of his head. - You saw them? Let's get out of here. - She has an idea. You want to tell them? I thought it'd be better I'll stay and keep a fire going. It'll give you a long time, I don't get this at all. We take Fuller with us. - Can he ride? - Carry him? Are you crazy? You can't carry Ask him. And how about you? Besides, why doesn't he stay? He risked his life I'm not losing mine for him. You'll lose it if no one stays. Can't Fuller stay? Now, wait a minute. ...if somebody stays ...it'll look like we're still here. And Fuller can't move. You've got no choice because What's she trying to prove? That one of us is a hero Anyway, it's her funeral. You think it's a good idea? At least it is one. You mean, you let her stay? - Why didn't you ask her? Ask her if you could. I liked your speech out there. I thought it had a good idea. It was very dramatic too. You staying behind to save the life I didn't believe the truth - What truth? He couldn't get to you heart And you decided to make this play. You'll stay behind. It isn't that much. A few hours Don't make more of it than it is. I'm not. I'm making it exactly what it is. - What are you trying to say? A grandstand, a trick. That you think no one That you never had the least That no 5 men will ride away - You believe that? But it's a good trick, ...and it'll work. On who? On me. Because I'm staying with you. Why? Because I'm a fool. Not to me. What am I to you? Maybe it'll help if I tell you. It won't. It's easy because it's nothing. You're nothing at all. Just nothing. Another, Leah? This one understands you, Now I know if I'd have understood They'll work and kill How do you do it, Leah? I'll get you ready to go. You're staying He doesn't believe in you. But he'd stay. - Leah. So would I. I don't need it. - I think I can ride. - Let's get rid of this. It's all right. How long will you stay? Don't worry. Here's the map. If his leg holds up What should we do, - I don't go for this. It's a little late for that. It's too late. You heard him. - Are you sure you want it this way? I think you're right. This will do. On the dead run we don't have With this cripple along to slow us We're going to rest. He can rest later. If that's what you think, go ahead. Alone? Followed by Indians? You've got a sack of gold, - I'll build a fire and make coffee. Don't you think they Or how you came This isn't your best chance. But you'd have to get rid of me. - I haven't. That young one has, Why don't you answer? All right, I'll say it. How many times You never wanted to share What do you want them to share Somebody else got something to say? Fiske, Vicente, You, take this end. He's really not like this. - None of us are. I'll go fix some food. Come here. You want to get rid of me? I don't care about you ...but we might get out of here I won't any more. - Where you going? Nothing Hold it, Daly. He's dead. - Why didn't you stop him? Hooker, here. Why don't they take us? Maybe they like it this way, ...one at a time in a place they pick. John! Don't look, it's no use. Hooker. Easy. This ought to do. - Coffee? No coffee. There's a little cave over there. I could build a fire in it, - Do you think we ought to? Go ahead. We'll camp. - You couldn't sleep either? Every time I close my eyes I didn't think he hated me that much. Maybe he didn't. After all he said? After all any man says, - How do you mean? He was a dead weight. He was You gave him a chance to live. Maybe he did the same for you. I wish I could remember him I do. Go on to sleep. A cross isn't a bad thing to see. It can be beautiful That was his. Go on to sleep. - Are we near that trail? It's narrow, Ride for it. This looks like the place to stay. When they want to try that trail Couldn't they come around the hill? It'll take them a long time. This is the chance I thought we had. - You mean, if we stay here? What does that mean? You take her and get out of here. - How long? - I couldn't? With a rifle you can't hit - You want to bet something? Neither have I. How about our lives? Just do what I told you. Hooker, you told everybody else, Don't tell me what to do. - No one of you are going to do this. - Not for me. This is between us. Don't listen to him. He's tried to make me bet something All right. - High card stays? You never trust me. I was always told, cut the deck. Are you both crazy? - Have you gone crazy too? For once something has got Cut. Age before beauty. You lose. Now get out. You bet something Take it and get out. And take her with you. This is the only thing ...cards. See you later. Sure, see you there. You're in the clear now. The old priest called it, Fiske. He cheated me back there. I don't know how, - Why? - You'd have stayed if you'd won. - Why? All over the world, He cheated me. He's better than I've got to go back and tell him. - You knew that? I'll see you sometime. No, don't. Don't move me. You... ...you said I... ...couldn't hit the side - Look at that. One thing I had against you, ...you knew so much. You always knew everything. Not quite. You were right about her. But not about you. You cheated me. - You come back to tell me? There it goes, Hooker. Everyday it goes... ...and somebody always goes with it. Today it's me. Yeah, I cheated you. No. Go home, Hooker. Build one somewhere. Get a hammer and nails. You know how, Take... Take her home. The Garden of Evil. If the earth was made of gold, I guess men would die
