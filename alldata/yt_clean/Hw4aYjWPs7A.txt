They never would give us See all the cows they got now on here? - [Peter] Yeah. - They would never give us no loans and stuff to buy a tractor My daddy, so we didn't make enough money to be able to afford a tractor, so we only had our mules and stuff. With the farming amount of farming we did, it was just only for We raised our molasses, we raised them and we sold them for $6 a gallon, and that's where we made our little money. The cotton, we'd bring right on this road in our mule and wagon. So we had a wagon, we'd pack or two of cotton, we'd It's gotta be, what was About 2,000 pounds. - You were harvesting - Yes, just for us. - You'd bring the cotton down and sell it? - Yep, and we would get maybe if that. - That was my daddy and my cousin, them sharecropping with Mr. Sentry McGee. But then once he died, then And we just only had that - [Peter] So what's sharecropping exactly, can you explain that? - So sharecropping more by him letting us farm on the land, we would get two bales of Same thing as corn, we'll we'll take him a load to - [Peter] So it's just his - That's right, but it was 10 with my mom and dad, so you But we had hogs and a few cows, goats, and that's what we kind of lived off, chickens, raccoons, possums, So all that was cotton. - [Peter] It's just been picked, right? - [Booker T.] Yeah, yeah. - [Peter] You can see - On the ground, yeah. - [Peter] So there's good - Yeah, there's more than I ever seen, you know? - [Peter] Oh really? - Yeah, because it used to be of growing up, wherever we See that stalk out there? I should get you a stalk. We'll grab some out of field up here. - So they used to just come out? - Yeah. - Cotton ball by cotton - Just, yeah, just picking it by hand. - [Peter] So that's how it grows? - [Booker T.] Yeah, see - [Peter] Yep. - [Booker T.] The summer, - [Peter] That's it. - Uh-huh, so you can - [Peter] So how would you pick it? Would you take, you break the whole stem? - No, no, you just come here. - [Peter] And you just fill up a bag? - Yep, see how I'm picking it? - [Peter] You're saying a bale, though, goes for over $1,000? - We'll pull it up and see kinda now, but back then, so you pick that like that and get them out them balls. We used to play with them And we'd get them and have a few of them. But you take that cotton with both hands and you put it in the all the way up the row. - That was the time when having more kids made you better off. - Was good, yes, so see, it When my dad met my mom, she already had, she had six kids, but two of 'em died, so it wasn't no problem with four kids already. - Because he was coming in on a farm, and he, you know? - He's like, &quot;Sweet, more money makers.&quot; - And then he had four more by my mom, and then so it was always eight of us. And then my brother and sister and them, by the time we got up of age to farm, they was kind of easing out. - And then we would hire in that local area and pay them, and our daddy paid them a little money. But we just, our food and and all that, give us out and you keep your shoebox for Christmas where you could put your stuff in it that they give you for Christmas, your little oranges and And every year only I would just, I'd get a paper cap pistol, a paper gun. - Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, that was, looked like every year, you got your paper cap gun, you know? - So literally in one generation, it went from have as many kids as possible 'cause it's gonna make you to don't have many kids - Yeah, they're expensive now. - It changed in one generation. - Yep, and then that's why you see now, like a lot of the womens what they are they're pretty well on welfare or something, you see? - Right. - Because that's, you know, but a lot of 'em now, it's because they're getting welfare or getting stamps and stuff like that. - Are a lot of people on - We got a lot of 'em, yeah, - A lot, like what percentage? - Especially after the virus.

Is it like, it was so long ago, whatever, or does it have some feeling to it? - It's just kind of like, and her fathers and forefathers, and them, you know, I know you know, probably, but you know, we were just so much out of But I just kind of feel for 'em, you know? The work that they, the torture and stuff they went through, you know? Yep, and like I said, a You know how the in house slaves were, the prettier womens and all like of that? That's what they did, - [Peter] Okay. - They kept them in house to cook, and whatever they did with 'em, you know? That's why you got so White kids and all, or that their parents was slave owners, and they went with the women, so they end up with their kids, they had kids by their womens, so you see?

I treat people like I want to be treated. If I got a negative eye from you, then I'm through with you, But if you treat me right, - [Peter] So how is it - It's still, we still got a And you can tell it from some folks, but the few I that got come and if they, you know, deal with me, I deal with them, you know?

You know, you can just No, y'all come on, y'all And we got down there, and when he went inside, we're and he told us we had to go So we went around, he had to go in, and we went around to the back and sat, and it was the worst because you know, I wasn't understanding more of the prejudice back then, you know? - [Peter] Okay, when was that? - So that was in like, so I would say I was probably so that was like in '60, in '72, '68, '72. - [Peter] So in the '70s it was like that? - Yeah, yeah. When I got older, I said, &quot;I know I need to leave here and do something - [Peter] Okay. - And I just seen how the life was, and the prejudice and all that, and that's what made me leave Mississippi. - [Peter] So in 42 years, 'Cause you left at that What are your thoughts? - Well, yeah, in there, like I said, you're meeting people Used to, you didn't hardly talk to him like that in - [Peter] So there's integration - Well, and that's another thing.

And I told him, we'd just I'd like to see more ambition in kids now than what they are doing, you know? Far as working, and you know, get a craft or something, you know? And not just being like sorry, and don't want to do nothing, you know? - Right, right, right. - You want the money, but they don't want the labor- - Right. - And it takes labor to make money, so. - Right, right. - That's it, you know? - It's a evil town. It's a evil state. They don't want you to have anything. - [Booker T.] Yeah, man. - If you get anything, ain't nobody gonna help - [Peter] Who's they? - It's still, I'm sorry. - Go ahead. - It's still like a Black and White thing down here in the South. - It's moved since way back in the time, but this particular town into the ways it was years and years ago. - So Blacks had to strive and everything that they wanted, you know? And Whites have always had it easy, because like you said, They kept it on in their family, so it was handed down to and find ways to get it on their own, or do like Booker, move outta state. - [Peter] Can I say some Whites, yes, some Whites I see in the trailers, like they're not doing too well, right? - Yeah, they didn't get They didn't have nothing to hand them, so they had to struggle too. So like but that comes Back in the old days, Blacks sharecropped, so you sharecropped with some Whites too. Those Whites were just but you were working together with them to try to obtain something. - [Peter] Okay. - So then you have the that do have that generational wealth that owned the plantations or whatever, and then you had some on the plantation too so it kind of comes two different ways. - [Peter] But the ones that really control where it's generational wealth? - Yes. - [Peter] Is that what you're saying? - Yes, definitely. - [Peter] Okay. - And then you just have to get in where you fit in, you know? - Right. - Booker T., this is my - [Booker T.] Okay. - So thank you for that.
