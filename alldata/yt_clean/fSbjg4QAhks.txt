Let us pray. I've got one thing Just one thing we've talked about before. One thing that gives us peace of mind, even amidst the struggle It's a Christian thing It's what the Bible teaches. It's what the Christian martyrs It found its roots in England, and not only began to fill the land It's the story of the Crusaders, the destruction of Napoleon, and now the thing The thing is this, playing the game for the game's sake. Gresham needs no introduction. Let's go! I have joined the Royal Flying Corps. It's our new weapon to punish the Hun, We are caning them, when your turn comes. I only hope it isn't all over Goodbye. -Goodbye. Hello? Hello? Hello. Yes, please, sir. -Can I help you, sir? I'm Croft, second Lieutenant Croft. -You're the replacement, sir? Just you, sir? That's right. I'll show you to your billet, sir. Thank you. I'm Bennett, sir. If there's anything you want, sir, I'm the best corporal, sir. I expect you could do Yes, please. Tea and biscuits. In the mess, 10 minutes. Sorry about that, sir. It should have been sent on. See you in the mess, sir. Yes, thank you. I'm Croft. How are you? Where is everyone? Flying. Whizzing around in circles. I hope you like rich tea, sir. I wangled some bourbon, -Is rich tea all right, sir? Grit biscuits. If there's anything else you want, sir, Shall I pour? Yes, dear, you pour. You're not up today, then? No, so it appears. Neuralgia. Oh, dear. Just in time for tea. -You must be Croft. I'm very pleased to meet you. -My name is Sinclair. -You've met Crawford, I take it. Croft, Crawford. Welcome to Saint Urbain, Have you had experience at Bessy Fives? -About four hours. Mine's an Avro. We've been making alterations -Do you want to look over her? Oh yes, very much. Two weeks. That's how long you're lasting now. Fourteen days. I wouldn't be so, It's just a piece of impartial advice. Take it or leave it, please yourself. I'm afraid -Except mine. Well, help yourself. -Climb all over the bloody thing. Gresham is the CO here. Yes, I know. Incredible stroke of luck. -You know him then, do you? How near the front are we? About 10 miles due east of here. It seems terribly quiet. Don't worry about that, if the wind's right. How do you like my old bus? Marvellous. It wasn't really a stroke of luck. -What? -No? I pulled strings on that. I know you shouldn't, No. You mustn't expect him to be. He's bound to have changed. Oh, yes. I'll show you Crawfords. We had pups before. We're lucky to get these. -Everybody's after them, isn't that right? Go on, climb aboard. We also got a couple of FEs, that he absolutely swears by. I can't wait to get up. He'll want you to go out with him, It sounds like the patrols are coming in. Hey, guys. Let's go up and see him. Shall we? Yes, of course. -Are you all right, sir? I think we've been hit -Better check if these lines are working. Good luck. -Sergeant. -We seem to have been hit on the strut. Let's repair this one and check that one, I'll rerig it, sir. It's Croft. Sinclair? Sinclair. We lost Dickson. He went down somewhere behind Grand Corps. You better ring divisional HQ, Right away. -Have those spares arrived yet? -They promised. -I know, but they promised. I'll phone them now. Lyle, Crawford! -You should've stood this rigging by now. It's only one. Look, send him somewhere else, can't you? -I think that would be most irregular. That's damned unkind. He thinks an awful lot of you. Yes, I'm his bloody hero. Well, that's only natural. Maybe, but how long does it go on for? When does it stop? This damn thing's gone again. How many squadrons are there out here now? Two hundred? He arrives right here. Bloody coincidence. -You should be pleased. He's an awfully nice fellow. Look at this. Notice anything? That's his sister. Oh my God. She thinks I'm bloody wonderful, too. If only she knew let alone fly a plane, Come on, uncle. John, why don't you put in for some leave? Then go where? Go home and breathe whiskey in her face? Pretend I've got neuralgia? No, thanks. I'll stay here and look after him. That's what we're here for. Looking after him and people like him. All right? You're all so damn young. I'll look out for you. I'll be back in a minute. -Do you know where I'll go after this? I'll tell you, to the hangar. -Do you know why? To check my ammunition, No offense to the mechanics, but they don't have to go up Come off it, Thompson, you'll unnerve him. I am just telling him and why I'm still here. I do not have the MC, but I have CMD. Confidence in the mechanical details. Thank you. -Bravo! -Have you had a drink, Croft? -Incredible coincidence, you being here? -How many hours have you put in? Four of them are on SC5s. -We'll soon knock that up. Excuse me, sir, It's the sugar, sir, for the custard. It's the depot, sir, Make the custard anyway. Without sugar, Bennett. Yes, sir. Take this. Can you send the steward here? Thank you. Dickson didn't make it, I'm afraid. Poor old Dickie. It was all burned up when they reached it. So was Dixon. All burned up. -More port, anyone, uncle? What a pity. -Why wouldn't they give us parachutes? The sky will be absolutely littered Yes, I'm afraid Rather than save experienced pilots they prefer sending schoolboys -I suppose they think it looks better. Fine minds they have at GHQ. GHQ has said. -About tomorrow, Croft. Crawford and I will take you up You want to get all the hours you can, Right. Thank you, sir. -Good night. Crawford and I will take you up Crawford and I will take you up Crawford and I... Crawford. Crawford. Crawford. Crawford. Crawford. God, let me go home! Croft won't let you down. All these months, Well, he's in for a few surprises. Come on, come on. I don't think he'd be disappointed. Oh, no? What do you think he'll write about me That I look twice my age Look here. Wouldn't you rather I went up with him? Don't forget, I'm the House Captain. -Good morning. -All ready? Ready to go? Before I left, Thank you. See if you can find Crawford. Crawford, are you ready? -Crawford. -Gresham said... I'm sorry. Go and tell sir You kill some huns for me. He doesn't seem to want to come. -A cup of tea, sir. Give Mr. Thompson my compliments Yes, sir. -Bennett. With my apologies. Yes, sir. Yes. What is it, Crawford? I can't go out this morning, Gresham. -It's this neuralgia. -The planes are being armed. -It's right in my eye. I understand it can't be diagnosed. I've got to see the MO. I'm no use to you here. I'll go this morning. -No, you won't. You're not going to, What about those fishtail clips Not arrived yet, sir. -Chase them up, will you? You can't go up alone, uncle. -Best of luck. See you later. -Contact? Keep close to me all the time. When you get to 6,000 feet, and don't try anything fancy, understand? CMD. Contact. Shaky. -Are they getting worse? Poor sod. Details two and three stand by our feet. Come on, get on with it. Got one of them on the ground. I got my very own Hun on the ground. We'll get the lorry. We'll go and pick him up. -Croft's not back yet? He was standing there as bold as brass. Let's go and pick him up -It's in the French side. I better phone the brigade and tell them Otherwise, we'll be all night. We'll wait for Croft. When he comes, Number three wants a bull race Yes, sir. Hun. Please. -Pull him up. -Let me hold it. Come on. Come on, harder, Come on now. -Morning? A bit lost. Do you know the way to Saint Urbain? Saint Urbain, yes. Right, Four men, over here. -Turn this aircraft around, corporal. Thank you very much. -Contact? Right, come on, you men. Dreadful landing. I did it much better in a field -Good to have you back. Hey, good one. Thanks, Gresham. That was tremendous. Tremendous, what was so tremendous? The Hun, the way you sent him packing. Tremendous. Where have you been? I got lost, You asked a battery, -I didn't think. All the time, -I'm sorry. I had no idea. No idea. Go on, report your damage. Croft, when you've done that, I'll buy you a drink. You show too much. Yes. I know. Thank you for bringing me, sir. [French spoken audio] Merci. [French spoken audio] [French spoken audio] -He's gone. He can't just disappear. [French spoken audio] He's my prisoner for 24 hours. Tell him, can you explain that? For 24... [French spoken audio] -What? [French spoken audio] People are dying, they go up, -He's a prisoner of war. -Unwritten law, can you explain? -He doesn't understand. -It is an unwritten law. [French spoken audio] Gentlemen, Your very good health, gentlemen. Perhaps you care Thank you. When you fall, Wait till you fall. -That's two points for a cannon, I think. Might as well get used to it. Probably, it'll last a week. Oh, damn. Good shot. I think you've mastered the subtleties Good shot, uncle. Excuse me. I wondered -Put them away. -Yes, it's boring gossip. Open. -Open? I didn't realize that, -Give me the letter. Give me the letter. -It's private. -John! Give me the letter, and go and practice some map reading. Maybe you won't have to ask the artillery My go, isn't it? No, it's mine. I don't want to read the bloody thing. Shall I read it? Do what you like. Do you want to hear this? We flew from England. I'm not allowed to say exactly where. Imagine my feelings Major Gresham. All my efforts had worked out. John is tired, but only from hard work Everybody says he's a brilliant pilot. It was proved to me on my first patrol. He shot down a Hun but there's nothing vain about him. Well, you know John. He's very calm and I admire him tremendously, and I'm proud to think he's my friend. This dent in their line. What is this dent in their line? The wire's intact along here. What about the dent? -It's high ground, surely. -What's there, does anyone know? -Is it concrete or pillboxes? We must have a photograph. -Where is the photograph? Not for that bit there. If the barrage hasn't smashed it, Of course, the whole thing could stop. -We could lose a brigade. I'm sorry, but we must have a photograph. A difficult job, sir. During a barrage, it's very tricky. Of course it's difficult. Yes, but during a barrage... -Therefore, it's a barrage. I cannot stop the barrage. Impossible. If we lose a plane, what's that? If we go charging in there we'd lose a couple of thousand men, -The advance would break up. I am sorry, but there's no option. -Yes. -Soon, please. -A terrific bike, thank you. I was going to get rid of it, Then the war broke out. A stroke of luck, really. They say you can hear the guns in England. You can, where I live. Mind you, that's in the south. Really? Where? New Forest, near Brockenhurst. That's incredible! -Is it? Not Brockenhurst, but not far, Lyndhurst. Do you fish? Come and have a look at this. We don't get them like that in Hampshire. We should be getting back, I suppose. When the offensive starts... We'll be in the thick of it. Major Gresham Thank you, Bennett. What's the idea? -You knock at the door, Crawford. Sit down. Sit down. Where were you going? It's my car, isn't it? Just answer the question. -To see a doctor. Gresham, I'm going home. I've had enough. I'm going home. That's all there is to it, I'm ill, and I'm going home. -You're staying with us. He'll send you straight back here. I've been in touch with base, Crawford. They know all about your complaint. You've got to let me go. I can't stand it here. Please, Gresham. Please let me go. If you go out of here, I'll have you court-martialed Do you understand that, Crawford? I'll have you shot. Sit down. I know exactly how you feel. You do? You do? Yes, exactly. Empty. A great vacuum of fear. I'm scared stiff, too, Crawford. If you know, If you know what real fear is, for Christ's sake, let me out of it. What would happen then? If everybody just went home, That's their choice. Those who want to die can die, and those who want to go home go home. Stick it out with us, Crawford. I have every intention and so should you. I promise this will go no further. Meet me in the mess in five minutes. Major Gresham sent his apology, sir, -This is a new thing, is it? They're all the rage. Driver? There's no doubt in my mind I have it on impeccable authority. How else do you explain There is a special office in Whitehall, Rubbish. I have it on impeccable authority. Feasible. You just got to have it. People have to have it every few hours, -I've heard of this complaint. Not a complaint. Next to the cabinet room is this bedroom. Correct, with a private entrance. -A private entrance now? Correct, with a private entrance. Where ladies make themselves available Correct. -There is a rota. If I'm sure, exactly what this authority is. Aren't we? Agog. I'm afraid I can't reveal my sources. It is a lady. I can't go any further. Has this lady, by any chance, Is she on the rota, Silkin? Come on, spill the beans. -Out with it, man. The whole truth, It's my wife. Don't get up. Everything all right? -Yes, sir. There is one thing, sir. Well, fire away. -My report, sir. -About the need for parachutes. -Didn't we get something back on that? Yes, possession of parachutes. -What was it? That's right, when in difficulties, It's a good phrase that. Sorry, but there you are. Sit down. Your orders. Thank you, sir. You've got your tongue out, Tommy. Haven't you got anything better to do? It's just an observation. I fly with my tongue out, too. Isn't that terribly dangerous? Only if it gets frostbite. Now, Thompson's patent grenade dropper. -How about that? -Gresham, have you seen this? Fancy a walk, uncle? -They're even louder tonight. The offensive begins in three days. -We'll be busy then. Only they want some pictures first. -That's where I come in, isn't it? I'm awfully sorry, uncle. Someone has to do it. Yes. They are specially for you. I'm flattered. -The barrage won't be lifted, I'm afraid. It stinks, doesn't it? I'll send Roberts They're good chaps. Who would you like as your driver? What about Croft? Croft? He only has to fly in a straight line. Yes, that's all. Why not Croft? He has to take his chance All right, take Croft. How are you feeling? Fine. Got a couple of chaps on top, keeping an eye on us. -It shouldn't take too long. It's just hanging around. I think I'll go. I'm sorry, after you. I was just going to say I'm glad I'm with you. Me, too. Gresham should be here soon, You're okay, sir? I hope you won't miss lunch, sir, I have every intention I'll see what I can do. I think we should be going, Yes, of course we should. Remember what I said. Keep above 200 feet. Don't make a song and dance to it. I won't. -Contact. Sorry, sir. The recce's back, sir. Thank you, Bennett. Thank you. -Christ, uncle. You never saw anything like it. They were sitting ducks. I never want to be that close again. Stephen. No, let me have one. Stop. No! Leave them, Keep quiet. Get your hands off. Come on. Put them down. -You'll get your thumbs all over them. -Do you see? No. -Mr. Croft isn't here yet, Bennett. I did look in his room, sir. Lights, Bennett, lights. -He didn't say he wouldn't be here? Go and find him and tell me where he is. Lights, Bennett. I'll put them out, sir. -Thompson, are you sitting in the stalls? Come on don't be too sad. There. -Why is that lady standing there? -What are you doing with your fingers? Right. Ship ahoy, my lovely. -What a big pussy. Give me the lion's share of that one. Tommy, don't go into a spin. Next. Cheeky. -Let's see what she's like from the front. Well, no, it's the same on this side. Where are you spending your leave? Leeds. Where else? Halifax. Funny. I've never been to Leeds. You wouldn't like Leeds. Why not? A dirty place is Leeds. Muck hole. Aye. Clean walk right up to here. Been to Venice, Paris, and Heidelberg but never to Leeds. I don't know why. -Peckham? Peckham. No, can't say I have. That's funny. I thought you would have. Why exactly? He's pulling your leg, sir. Good one. Fancy a sandwich? Go on. It won't bite. Thank you. Now, for your delight and relaxation, What's wrong with that? -We're getting fussy. What I'd call udderish. -I wouldn't say no. -About Mr. Crofton, sir. -Apparently, he's in the hangar, sir. Is Mr. Croft here with you? Did you hear me? I said, do you know where Mr. Croft is? Yes, sir. -What are you doing here? Nothing? -I was just talking... -Corporal Elliot gave me some. Since when have you been dining -He offered me a sandwich, I... Don't finish that. Wait outside. Thank you, sir. You disgrace yourself being with them. They laugh at you, Sorry, I came here, I offended you. Only when you humiliate yourself. -Now, clean up and join us in the mess. How can I when Sinclair is dead? You really do believe Well, I resent that. I can't tell you He wasn't my House Captain. He was my friend. That's a good idea. Crawford offered to run us into Amiens, -I can't take everybody. -Yes, let's go to Amiens. Wait, it's only a five-seater. One thing, Croft will be joining us. All right. It's a full house, then. Come on, Croft. -Come on, get in there. Get your priorities right. CO first. Dive in. There's a table. Come to me. All right, everybody sit down. Guys, quality has taken a dive this week. Well, chaps, here's to a jolly party. Drink your booze, Croft. -Sante. I have a premonition. I have a premonition Aren't you, Wade? It is distinctly possible. It is distinctly possible Bravo! Hey, she's giving me the eye, that one. I don't want any of them. I'm waiting for my blonde. She's in the hospital. No, she isn't, I saw her half an hour ago. She must have discharged herself Now, which one should we choose for Croft? Choose one, son. I'll bring him back a recommendation. I'm going on a little trip. Do my duty. As a reward for so much patience. -Go on then, get on with it. -I'm going. Tell us, Croft, laddy, Yes, come on, Croft. Now speak. Speak, Croft. When was your wick last dipped, Guys, we shan't tell. Despite what mummy said to you, it was not made for pissing through. Champagne. I do believe -Not bad. I won't have to force myself. [French spoken audio] -Are you well? -Yes? -I see. Some pleasure. Pop while you see. Be the last four. [French spoken audio] He's toots, sir. He has nobody. Poor Croft. Un moment. I'll look after you. That can't be true, it's so funny. -Stop. Crofty, I think you might be lucky. She's not his girl, that officer. She belongs to his friend, -This man is a chaperone, understand? She's also bored. When she goes, you go after her. Behind, 50 meters. Fine. Croft. She is gold. Crofty, off you go. Contact, old boy. Don't stall. Happy landings, Crofty. [French spoken audio] Eighteeen? I do not speak English very well. I never have no one in here. You should not be here. It's very dangerous for you here. I have this friend, but he's a... [French spoken audio] Do you want to stay? Yes. Oh, you're a pilot! [French spoken audio] -Yes. You're very... [French spoken audio] -Is Paisley in, Roberts? -I want everyone in the mess. Care to inspect the menu, sir? Not now, Bennett. Could I take it as all right, sir? -Yes, sir. I'm afraid we've got a rotten job or a wonderful job, Sorry, sir. The offensive is bogged down, The reason is that their artillery The reason that they can do this so the balloons have to come down. Some of you In which case, The moment that we appear, That's one. The other, well, they're murder to get near. There's always a regiment and two or three patrols up above. We'll split ourselves into attackers and defenders The thing to remember They have a nasty habit The attackers are Thompson, Defenders Wade, Frampton, and myself. We'll leave at first light. Yes. It's Croft. All right. I hope I'm not interrupting. It's nothing. I was wondering. Do you want to go into town tonight? I don't think we're allowed to. Risk that? If I went into town, I wouldn't come back. Ever. They'd have to shoot me. Do you see? Wait for me. Hold it, driver. -No transport tonight then, sir? -Come on. -Away you go. -Can I come in? I'm buying drinks in the mess, I don't think so. I'd like you to. You'd like me to, but I won't. Contact. He's got to calm. Crawford. Crawford! Go and put him to bed. Don't tell anyone. Hey, you all, safe flight. -Good night, sir. Good night. Enjoy yourself, Stephen. Yes, thank you. Fine. -Have a good night's sleep. All right. Stephen. Crawford won't be with us tomorrow, At this very moment, In another hour, they'll be going down. You hope. Thank you, Bennett. You're a defender. That's right. We'll be safe as houses then. Off you go. Stay close to Tommy. Do what he does, then get away. Jolly good. Bennett. -Yes, sir. Nine o'clock sharp, sir, on the nail. How many for breakfast? Eight. Any of them? [German spoken audio] Yes. Hello. [German spoken audio] [German spoken audio] I'm writing to tell you that it is my sad duty. I feel I must write and tell you. It is with deep regret. The replacement officers. -Good afternoon. -How do you do, sir? Welcome to 76. How many hours? -How many what, sir? Fourteen, sir. Fourteen. -Bennet? These windows are dirty. Yes, I'll see to it, sir. -Can anyone play the piano? Good. That should liven the place up a bit. Right, off you go, dump your stuff.
