- Thank you so much. You know, that's a wonderful surprise. This night, is that it? (audience laughs) You know, I been in this 35 years, was it, like, eight people? (audience laughs) I don't know, I guess I expected more. (audience laughs) (chuckles) This is incredible. You're ******* amazing. Gary Clark, Jr., and the whole band, just, is amazing. What an amazing night. When I first got the call, when the Kennedy Center, I would receive the Twain Prize, I said to my wife, &quot;Don't give them any of our &quot;The Kennedys wanna give you the Twain.&quot; (audience laughs) &quot;And it could be yours, just, there's some shipping costs.&quot; But I Googled it, (audience laughs) and it's real. It's a real award. It's incredible, and to see you all here, masked, is so ******* weird, I can't even tell you. It does feel like a dystopian movie, or like a weird O. Henry story, where at the end they say to the comedian, you know, &quot;You can (audience laughing) You know, and backstage, I'm sure the comedians're like, &quot;Yo, did you see those eye crinkles? I was ******* killing it.&quot; (audience laughs) &quot;Oh my god, they were squinting. (audience applauding) This is a Faustian bargain, but I'm so glad for us back to normal, and finally the non-essential worker, that's really... (audience laughs) I think the pandemic taught us one thing; it's that, really, you don't need any of us, do you? (audience laughs) You need the grocery store, got it. This is a wonderful award. To see all my friends here, and all the people I've Just, it reminds me of just (audience laughs) for so long. (audience applauds) There're a lot of jokes about how I look (audience laughs) Touche. I am a Jew. This is what happens. (laughs) Black don't crack. But Jews, we age like avocados. (audience laughs) I have so many people to thank, really, for all this. First and foremost, my mother is here, who is right there. Who is gonna be 90. There you go. Come on, woman! This year, she is gonna be 90. Or as that's known in the (audience laughs) You know, everybody that's where I learned it. 1971 or 1972, my father left the family, and we had tough times. It was tough, and she coulda rolled over, but she didn't. She got up, and she showed me that you're not your circumstances. You're not what happens to you, you're what you make of it. And she got up, and she and she gave us a good life. And I could never repay her for that. And the punchline, my father died 10 years ago. Winner, winner, chicken dinner, (audience laughs) Yeah! Who's laughing now? Yeah, I still have issues. (audience laughs) I wanna thank my brother, who is here. My brother, who was so academically gifted that I knew I would have to go in a different direction, so, I thank him for that. (audience applauding) That is my boy. I can't tell you, and this is advice for anybody. If you like to do dumb ****, which is something I like very much to do, I cannot recommend more, creating a small child who also likes to do dumb shit. Because then, you can do the dumb **** and say, &quot;It's what he want, what?&quot; (audience laughs) Little Maggie is also here. Nothing's better than when &quot;You wanna go for a drive?&quot; And we get in the car And if any of you wanna have get in the car with your daughter and drive down the Jersey shore, and listen to Jay Cole &quot;She's (audience laughing) And it's beautiful. And I can't be prouder of the both of you, and I love you both so much. (audience applauds) And my wife, who... I met my wife on a blind date in 1995. And our first date, I We went to a little hole-in-the-wall place called Lupe's East LA Kitchen on 6th Avenue and Watts in New York. And we went there because I am a ************* baller. But it was a really interesting date, because she didn't say anything the whole time. So afterwards, I thought, &quot;Well, I'll take one last shot.&quot; I was walking her back, she lived on Mulberry Street. I said, &quot;You wanna just duck into a bar real quick, and just have a quick drink?&quot; Well, one scotch and soda and it was on. qwer And I was hooked. And I have to say, again, if you're gonna go on a date, make sure the place has a liquor license. (audience laughs) Because if it doesn't, you could miss out on your favorite person in the world. (audience applauds) Still the best laugh I ever earned. And to all the people that I can't thank you enough. It's ironic, I carry around, always, a quote by Twain. It just so happens that I am never without it. And it's about ideas, and the quote is, &quot;The radical invents the views. But when he has worn them out, the conservative adopts them.&quot; And I keep that with me as a reminder that even for Twain, they're (audience laughs) Even the most celebrated artist amongst us ***** the bed. But the point is this, what we do is an iterative business. It's a grind. It's work. The best amongst us just keep at it. I began in 1987. And my journey began, it's the weirdest thing, I walked into a basement called the Comedy Cellar. And when you're a comic, you look in a room, and 200 seats are facing one way. And there's one stool, and it has a light shining on it. And you walk into that room, and go, &quot;That's gonna be my chair. I'm gonna sit in that one.&quot; And you spend the rest of your career trying to earn that stool. And some nights, man, you you don't even belong on the street. But you get back at it, because there isn't any fixed point in comedy where you make It's the journey, with the greatest friends I And the terrible nights, and the fun we have sitting at the table. That's what this weekend's is catching up with great friends, and sitting at the table, and laughing our ****** like, &quot;Oh god, what time do we have to be there tonight?&quot; Not that you're not great. (audience laughs) And there's a lot of talk right now about what's gonna happen to comedy. You know, there was the slap. And what does the slap say about comedy, and is comedy gonna Now I've got news for you, comedy survives every moment. And having Bassem, here, of the true threat to comedy. (audience applauds) It's not the woke police that're gonna be an It's not the Fresh Prince, it's the crown prince. It's not the fragility of audiences, it's the fragility of leaders. You don't owe us anything, as an audience. If we say **** you don't do whatever you gotta do. Don't get up and hit us. (audience laughs) But that's just the game we're in. We talk **** for a living, you talk **** back, and we And we've gotta find a But the threat to comedy, comedy doesn't change the world, but it's a bellwether. We're the banana peel in the coal mine. When a society is under threat, comedians're the ones It's just a reminder to people that democracy is under threat. Authoritarians are the threat to comedy, to art, to music, to thought, to poetry to progress, to all those things. All that **** is a red herring. It ain't the pronoun police, it's the secret police. It always has been, and it always will be. And this man's decapitated visage (audience laughs) is a reminder to all is fragile, and precious. And the way to guard against it isn't to change how audiences think. It's to change how leaders lead. And so, I thank you so much and for this award. Thank you. Good night. Unbelievable. (jazzy music)
