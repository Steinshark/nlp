Ben You are my Shifu. Shifu. Read after me. Shifu. Shifu. I am your Shifu? Yes. You are my Shifu. Shifu. Please accept my respect. So you will go back to China because of him? Yes. If you don't love him any more one day, please make sure you give me a call, OK? Morning. I am hungry. I cook the breakfast for you. Meiya, actually you'd better consider my proposal that you stay in France. Your curriculum is perfect. And you are very hard-working. You could be recruited in any top cosmetic in the world with my reference letter. You would have a very bright future. I understand. Thank you very much. However, the future of the cosmetic in China is also great and booming. Anyway, no matter where I am, I won't fail you, my professor. You are really great. I am so proud of you. Thank you again for the cake. So I can eat more. Go ahead. What's wrong? You know? A man will be more charming if he cooks. Unlike the two in my family. They know nothing about it. If I were them, I would not do it either. Your chef is Michelin grade. Who will do that themselves? You are very luck, you know? You don't know how beautiful the real life Is actually. OK. Then I give you the beautiful real life every day. Go ahead. It is getting cold. Stop. OK. OK. Ouch. Stop it. I am going back with you. Meiya, dump this torn bag. I am afraid it would be broken. Siyu, don't do that. It has a hole there but it is still fine. Don't throw it away. I gave you this case. It is great. Don't carry that old bag. Hear me? You just bought it, right? This is an expensive case. You just keep it. That bag is broken but it is still workable. I like that. No. I just felt it was good looking when I bought it. But now I think it is not suitable for me. It is good for you. You can take care of it for me if you use it I will forget where it is if it is here. Well, you need to take it. OK. Thank you very much, Siyu. Don't worry. I will take care of it. Oh, Siyu. I prepared these all for you. You can take it for a long time. You just cook it for a while when you want to eat. The cooking method and the shelf life are here. Do you see it? Here, on the post-it. You need to check it carefully. Don't mess it up. Meiya, what shall I do if I am without you. Why don't you stay? You live with me. I am used to it. I will feel lonely when I live just by myself. I already graduated and no scholarship anymore. By that little part-time jobs' paid, how can I live here? I will pay for your bills. You stay here as usual. I've been living here for a few years. I was relying all on you. I felt very sorry already. No. Who said that? You are my all-rounder. You cook for me and clean the house for us. I am quite lucky. Siyu, I really have to thank you for your taking care of me these years. Thank you. Well, it is great friendship between you and me. OK. Siyu. I will go to the airport myself. Call me when you have time. OK? I know. Oh, I had a friend in this airline company. I arranged a free first-class seat upgrade for you. When you get on board, the airline friend will come to help you. Or it kills you to stay 10 hours In the economic class seat. Thank you. Siyu, I can be with you studying in the same college. And I can be your best friend. I am so proud And so lucky. Let me help you. Thank you for upgrading my ticket. Excuse me? Your ticket is first-class. It was not an upgrade seat. Really? Don't you know Xu Siyu? Sorry, I don't know. What would you like to drink? Just like that. OK, Madame. Thank you. Now I know. She upgraded it by herself. It is not for free. She kept my pride for saying that to me. So I can accept it as her good will. If I were not studying in the same college with her, I thought we would not have a chance to know each other. I spent all my effort studying and got this chance to study in France. My father spent all of his money. For this, I did a lot of part-time jobs Everyday to cover my living expense. And her father is a famous investor in China investment business. It seems that she always has apartments everywhere in the world she'd been. However, she is also a girl with worry and concern as the others. Just money is the last thing she needs to worry about. Even I am not in the same class she is, but she respects me very much. She is really a well-educated and how really a good person Looks like. She makes me know that I must be making more efforts to work so I can return what she had helped me one by one in another way. Thank you. Excuse me? One more, Thanks. Excuse me? I spent several years in Europe And I have no idea about what happened in the Chinese entertaining market. I know little about it now. Are you a new actor or singer? You know? Paparazzi are everywhere following you stars. They take a ton of pictures and you would be on the headlines in the next day. I will hire bodyguards for sure. These people, are they having too much time to spend? I am sorry. Let's take a picture. Although I don't know who you are, but I can keep it as a record. When I know you later, I will show to others that I used to take a same plane with you. Come on. Please sign your name here. Thank you very much. What's wrong? I need to get off the plane. Do you know what will happen if I shout that you are kidnapping me? I know. Just do it. Great. You are great. I go back with you. Hey, how are you doing? I was drunk on the plane. I can't control myself. It make you embarrassed. I am sorry. Are you kidnapping? Do you need me to call the cops? Excuse me, Madame. This is my business card. I am the security supervisor in OU's group. My name is Jiang yilong. This is Ouyang, our vice president in our group. I just take him back home by the order from his father. Oh, I am sorry. It is a misunderstanding. Sorry. Sorry. Take your time. Too embarrassed. Hey, Zhe? I am going out from the exit. I am waiting for the luggage . You look very happy. Don't rush. Take it easy. I am already in the airport. Don't worry. Take your time. OK. See you later. Attention, passengers by No.7381 flight now are boarding.

He picked me up already. Now I am in his car. Where is he? Let me have a look. Be quick. OK. Chen Zhe. I didn't see. Let me have a look again. OK. Hey, Zhe, Siyu wants to say hi to you. Hi Chen Zhe.

Then you just go on your meeting. See you. See you. Who is that? Just for work. I guess so. You are very handsome when you are at work. Well, what did I say? Just forget it by Siyi's call. Oh, I remember. I met a guy on the plane. Do you know Ou's Group? The cosmetic brand? I met the son of Ou's boss on the plane. He just sit next to me. You know, a lot of people surrounded him. I though he is a pop star. However when the plane landed, those bodyguards stood up and carried him to move. I though he was kidnapped and I was going to help him I was going after him and tried to help him. Finally, the head of the bodyguard gave me a business card. That was a misunderstanding. I almost called the police. I was so embarrassed. Chairman and madame are waiting for you at home. Your sister also will go home. Can I have my phone back? Sorry. I was ordered by chairman. Sumsung assistant. Call Mom. Hello, Mom. I've picked him up on the way back home. OK. Bye. Just now when you were in the Exit, did you see a girl there? She is good looking but seemed very angry. I was far away from her but I also can felt chilly. Did you feel that. No. I think she is his family. I saw them stay together. It is too scared. I though rich family has not so much worries. Well, to my surprise, every family is the same. What? Anything? I finally can have a real Zhe here. Do you need a signature from me? Tu Dou. It is fine. I am on it. OK. The chef working hard here tossing the wok, the little old man, is my father. When I was six, he adopted me in the orphanage. I suffered from CHD when I was born. I was abandoned possibly because of this disease. My father raised me up alone. And he sent me to the hospital to cure my CHD. I felt very sorry for him. Because he was unmarried till now because of me. But he said he is just waiting for the woman he loved. But till now, the woman did not come to find him. Dad. I am hungry. OK. The food is ready. I asked my father that why he chose me such a kid with heart disease and raise me alone? My father said, because at that moment, I, the little pale girl, went towards him to hold his hand. Father. Tu Dou. Serve it. OK. Ya. You are home. Why didn't you give me a call and just go home silently. Father, you sweat a lot. Dad. Sorry. I shouldn't have been abroad for nearly a year without telling you. And I am sorry to trouble you that you sent a team to get me back abroad. I promise, I will inform you where I go next time. You don't have to apologize to me You'd better apologize to yourself. Now your sister is running all the business in the company. When can you be back To help her do something you can. Otherwise in the future, how can I hand over the company to you? Father, I never said that I want to manager the company. All the time, my sister runs it very well. She did a great job. All the business, She ran it very well. Why don't you hand over to her? That is a great idea. Why do you need me? How can you talk to your father like that? Dad, Mom. I am full. Take your time. Rui runs the company well and she runs it perfectly. Why don't you have over the company To her? I know why. Because she is not your own daughter. Mom, why do you say that?
