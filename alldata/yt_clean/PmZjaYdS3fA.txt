OUR FIRST GUEST IS ONE OF THE MOST TALENTED MEN IN THE WORLD. HE IS A MULTI-AWARD-WINNING RECORDING ARTIST, FASHION DESIGNER AND SHOE SALESMAN. HIS NEW ALBUM IS CALLED &quot;YE.&quot; PLEASE WELCOME KANYE WEST. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; Jimmy: FIRST OF ALL -- THANKS FOR BEING HERE AND THANK YOU FOR THE SHOES. NOBODY EVER BRINGS ME SHOES, YOU BROUGHT ME SHOES, THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU, VERY KIND. I'LL TELL YOU A STORY AND THIS IS HONESTLY TRUE. THE LAST TIME, A FEW YEARS AGO YOU SENT ME A PAIR OF YEEZYS. I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE HAD MORE PEOPLE COME UP AND TALK TO ME THAN WHEN I WAS WALKING AROUND IN THEM TO THE POINT WHERE I WAS LIKE, THIS IS CRAZY, I'VE GOT TO GET THESE OFF, PEOPLE ARE CHASING ME. I'M WORRIED PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BEAT ME UP AND TAKE THESE. USUALLY PEOPLE WAIT -- I'VE SEEN THEM SLEEPING ON THE STREET WAITING FOR THESE SHOES. IS THAT FOR YOU MORE REWARDING THAN HEARING PEOPLE SAY THEY LIKE YOUR MUSIC? &gt;&gt; BOTH. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: IT'S BOTH, YEAH. SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE THE THING YOU ARE ACCUSTOMED TO HEARING AND YOU START HEARING SOMETHING ELSE, AND IT'S MORE EXCITING TO HEAR SOMETHING ELSE. BUT NOT FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; YEAH, WHEN YOU GO OUT AND DO CREATIVE JOURNEYS, IT IS EXCITING FOR PEOPLE TO APPRECIATE THAT. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YEAH. &gt;&gt; ESPECIALLY IF PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, DIDN'T THINK THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE. LIKE WHEN I STARTED OFF IN CHICAGO AS AN ARTIST. AS A -- I'M A VISUAL ARTIST, I WENT TO ART SCHOOL. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND I DECIDED TO START DOING MUSIC AND PEOPLE SAID IT WOULDN'T WORK OUT. THEN I STARTED PRODUCING AND SELLING BEATS AND I STARTED SELLING BEATS TO JAY-Z, ROCKA FELLA AND THAT WENT WELL. I SAID I WANTED TO RAP AND PEOPLE SAID THAT WOULDN'T WORK, PRODUCER RAPPER, IT MEANT YOU WOULDN'T RAP AS WELL AS THE REAL RAPPERS. THAT STARTED WORKING OUT. I SAID I WANTED TO DESIGN CLOSES AND THAT STARTED WORKING OUT. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: WHAT'S THE NEXT -- WHAT IS NEXT FOR YOU? &gt;&gt; WELL -- &gt;&gt; Jimmy: SPACE FORCE? [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; I WOULD TOTALLY BE INVOLVED. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOU SHOULD DESIGN THE UNIFORMS FOR THE SPACE FORCE. [ LAUGHTER ] IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD DO IF PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED YOU TO DO THAT? &gt;&gt; I'M INTO DESIGNING. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YEAH, WHY NOT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOUR WIFE WAS HERE LAST WEEK -- &gt;&gt; SPACE FORCE! &gt;&gt; Jimmy: OH MY GOODNESS. SOMEBODY PUT A LEASH ON HIM, WILL YOU? YOUR WIFE WAS HERE LAST WEEK. AND SHE'S VERY NICE. AND SHE DID SOMETHING I WOULD IMAGINE YOU'RE VERY PROUD OF. SHE WENT TO WASHINGTON, SHE SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT, AND SHE ACTUALLY CONVINCED HIM TO GRANT CLEMENCY TO A WOMAN WHO GOT LIFE IN PRISON, LIKE REAL LIFE IN PRISON, FOR A FIRST-TIME DRUG OFFENSE. WAS THAT SOMETHING YOU DISCUSSED WITH HER BEFORE SHE DID IT? &gt;&gt; SHE'S SUPER PASSIONATE ABOUT IT. AND IT WAS AMAZING FOR TO SEE THAT DREAM COME TRUE. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: WERE YOU EVER CONCERNED ABOUT HER BEING ALONE IN THE OVAL OFFICE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP? [ LAUGHTER ] &gt;&gt; WELL, HE IS A PLAYER. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; Jimmy: PEOPLE GOT REALLY MAD WHEN YOU WERE -- WELL, SOME PEOPLE WERE VERY HAPPY WHEN YOU SAID YOU LIKED PRESIDENT TRUMP. DO YOU LIKE -- DO YOU THINK HE IS A GOOD PRESIDENT? &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO ASK ME -- CAN I ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION? &gt;&gt; Jimmy: ANSWER WHATEVER YOU WANT. &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW -- IT'S FUNNY, YOU KNOW. IN THIS WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN, THERE'S TWO MAIN MOTIVATING FORCES. AND I TWEET ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME. IT'S LOVE OR FEAR. AND YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN LOVE. YOU KNOW, MY COUSIN IS LOCKED UP FOR MURDER. AND I LOVE HIM. SO HE DID A BAD THING BUT I STILL LOVE HIM. AND JUST AS A MUSICIAN, AFRICAN-AMERICAN, GUY OUT IN HOLLYWOOD, ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE AROUND ME TRIED TO PICK MY CANDIDATE FOR ME. AND THEN TOLD ME EVERY TIME I SAID I LIKED TRUMP THAT I COULDN'T SAY IT OUT LOUD OR MY CAREER WOULD BE OVER, I'D GET KICKED OUT OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY BECAUSE BLACKS ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A MONOLITHIC THOUGHT, WE CAN ONLY BE DEMOCRATS AND ALL. SO -- EVEN WHEN I SAID IT RIGHT BEFORE I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL AND I EXPRESSED MYSELF, AND WHEN I CAME OUT I HAD LOST MY CONFIDENCE. SO I DIDN'T HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO TAKE ON THE WORLD AND THE POSSIBLE BACKLASH. AND IT TOOK ME A YEAR AND A HALF TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO STAND UP AND PUT ON THE HAT. NO MATTER WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WERE. AND WHAT IT REPRESENTED TO ME IS NOTHING ABOUT POLICIES BECAUSE I'M NOT A POLITICIAN LIKE THAT, BUT IT REPRESENTED OVERCOMING FEAR AND DOING WHAT YOU FELT, NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE SAID, IN SAYING, YOU CAN'T BULLY ME. LIBERALS CAN'T BULLY ME, NEWS CAN'T BULLY ME, THE HIP-HOP COMMUNITY, THEY CAN'T BULLY ME. AT THAT POINT, IF I'M AFRAID TO BE ME, I'M NO LONGER YE. THAT'S WHAT MAKES YE. I ACTUALLY QUITE ENJOY WHEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY ARE MAD AT ME ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS -- &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOU MUST ENJOY IT, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] &gt;&gt; I ACTUALLY QUITE ENJOY IT. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: BECAUSE YOUR WIFE WAS MAD AT YOU, RIGHT? ACCORDING TO YOUR SONG, YOUR WIFE WAS UPSET ABOUT THAT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT OR WRONG, OR EVEN IF I CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT IT OR THOUGHT ABOUT IT MORE, WHICH I'M NOT SAYING I DID -- JUST PLACE THE THOUGHT OUT THERE THAT EVERYONE'S BAD THINKING SOMETIMES. GALILEO, THEY WENT TO CHOP HIS HEAD OFF FOR SAYING THAT THE EARTH -- WHAT DID HE SAY? THE SUN REVOLVED AROUND THE EARTH? VICE VERSA. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU HAVE MODERN -- &gt;&gt; Jimmy: BUT THE SUN -- &gt;&gt; I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE SPECIFICS, SIR. [ LAUGHTER ] &gt;&gt; Jimmy: RIGHT, RIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; Jimmy: DO YOU EVER REGRET ANYTHING YOU SAY? OR IS IT JUST -- YOU LOOK AT IT LIKE, HEY, I PUT IT OUT THERE, IT'S OUT THERE, THERE'S NO POINT IN REGRETTING IT? &gt;&gt; I THINK PEOPLE FOCUS TOO MUCH ON THE PAST AND FOCUS TOO MUCH ON REGRET. EVEN LIKE WHEN YOU DEAL WITH SCHOOLS. LIKE YOU TAKE LIKE THE SLAVE IDEA. MY POINT IS, I'VE HEARD OF HISTORY CLASS. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A CLASS THAT BREAKS DOWN HOW YOU, YOU KNOW, BALANCE A CHECKBOOK OR HOW YOU CONTROL YOUR FINANCES, WHICH MY FATHER NEVER TAUGHT ME THAT. AND I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A FUTURE CLASS. SO THEY KEEP US SO FOCUSED ON HISTORY THAT WE START TO BELIEVE THAT IT ACTUALLY REPEATS ITSELF. AND WE BECOME OVERLY TRADITIONAL. AND WE CAN'T ADVANCE AS A RACE OF BEINGS. WE GET TOO CAUGHT UP IN THE PAST AND WHAT EVERYONE'S SAYING AND WHAT EVERYONE'S TWEETING. AND SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO BE FEARLESS ENOUGH TO BREAK THE [ BLEEP ] SIMULATION. WHEN I SAY SIMULATION, THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BY SIMULATION. SORRY, I KNOW YOU GUYS WANTED TO CLAP BUT EVERYTHING I'M GOING TO SAY IS GOING TO BE AMAZING. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HERE'S THE IDEA WHY YOU'RE IN A SIMULATION. LET'S START WITH ACTING, FIRST OF ALL. A 2-YEAR-OLD SCREAMS AT A RESTAURANT, THE ENTIRE RESTAURANT SCREAMS, TEACH THAT KID HOW TO ACT. WE'RE ALL UNPAID ACTORS IN SOME GIANT SCRIPT THAT WE DIDN'T WRITE. SIMULATION. A 2-YEAR-OLD JUMPS ON A COFFEE TABLE AND SOMEONE SAYS, THAT'S A COFFEE TABLE, DON'T JUMP ON THAT. SO IT WENT FROM BEING SOMETHING THAT MAKES HIM FEEL LIKE SUPERMAN, HE'S GOT HIS CAPE ON, TO SOMETHING WHERE HE HAS TO THINK ABOUT IN THE PERSON'S LIKE A FAMILY MEMBER, HE'S 2 YEARS OLD, DOESN'T GIVE A [ BLEEP ] ABOUT A COFFEE OR A TABLE. HE'S STARTING TO LIKE CALCULATE ALL THESE THINGS. BY THE TIME YOU'RE 40 YEARS OLD YOU'VE GOT A WALL FULL OF COFFEE TABLES CALCULATING YOU INTO CLA TRAFFIC, CALCULATING YOU INTO YOUR CAREER CHOICE, CALCULATING YOU INTO THIS TOWNHOUSE THAT'S NOT QUITE AS BIG AS THE TOWNHOUSE NEXT AND IT JUST NEVER WORKS. THAT'S THE SIMULATION THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY SIMULATION. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. BUT I MIGHT NOT. BUT ALSO MAYBE PEOPLE DON'T WANT THE KID TO GET HURT JUMPING ON THE COFFEE TABLE, YOU KNOW? &gt;&gt; WE ARE TOO PROTECTIVE. WE ALWAYS DON'T WANT SOMEONE TO GET HURT. CAN YOU IMAGINE ME TALKING TO MY PUBLICIST BEFORE I SAY I'M GOING ON TV AGAIN? [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOU SHOULD BE WEARING A HELMET. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING ON TV BECAUSE IT'S AWESOME. I LOVE JIMMY. WE CAN HAVE A DIALOGUE ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND NOT A DIATRIBE, YOU KNOW. IT'S LIKE WE CAN -- I GOT THAT FROM SARAH JESSICA PARKER. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT? &gt;&gt; YES. [ LAUGHTER ] SHOUT-OUT. SHOUT-OUT. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK GETS MISSED ON TMZ IS THE MAIN THING I WAS STRESSING IS THE IDEA OF TRYING LOVE. YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALWAYS, YOU KNOW -- PUSHING OUT SO MUCH HATE AND LOVE CAN CURE SO MUCH. JUST TO THINK, AM I MOVING IN LOVE? IS THIS OUT OF LOVE? NOT OUT OF PRIDE. PRIDE IS A WORD PEOPLE SAY IN A POSITIVE CONNOTATION, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS. IT TAKES TOO MUCH OWNERSHIP. YOU CAN REPLACE PRIDE WITH LOVE. AND WHEN I SEE PEOPLE JUST EVEN LIKE GO AT THE PRESIDENT, IT'S LIKE, WHY NOT TRY LOVE? FOR ONE PERSON TO STAND UP AGAINST ALL ODDS AND JUST HUG SOMEBODY THE WAY THAT ALICE JOHNSON HUGGED HER FAMILY WHEN SHE GOT OUT OF JAIL. THAT ONE BY ONE BY ONE WE CAN DEFUSE THIS NUCLEAR BOMB OF HATE THAT WE'RE IN AS A SOCIETY BY THINKING OF EVERYONE AS OUR FAMILY. AND HOW WOULD WE TREAT OUR KIDS? HOW WOULD WE TREAT -- &gt;&gt; Jimmy: IPY THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL THOUGHT BUT IN LITERAL TERMS THERE ARE FAMILIES BEING TORN APART AT THE BORDER OF THIS COUNTRY. THERE ARE LITERALLY FAMILIES BEING TORN APART AS A RESULT OF WHAT THIS PRESIDENT IS DOING. AND I THINK THAT WE CANNOT FORGET THAT, WHETHER WE LIKE HIS PERSONALITY OR NOT, HIS ACTIONS ARE REALLY WHAT MATTER. I MEAN, YOU SO FAMOUSLY AND SO POWERFULLY SAID, GEORGE BUSH DOESN'T CARE ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE. IT MAKES ME WONDER WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP DOES, OR ANY PEOPLE AT ALL? WHY DON'T WE TAKE A BREAK, WE'LL COME BACK, AND KANYE WEST IS HERE! HIS ALBUM IS CALLED &quot;YE.&quot; WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. KANYE WEST. WE JUST GOT THIS MAGAZINE. &quot;BAZAAR&quot; MAGAZINE. THERE YOU ARE WITH THE KIDS. THEY'RE VERY, VERY CUTE. CLIMBING ON YOUR HEAD. DO YOU DRESS THEM? DO YOU DRESS THEM? DO YOU PICK THEIR OUTFITS? &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOU DO? IS THAT FUN FOR YOU? &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: DO YOU DESIGN OUTFITS FOR THEM? &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOU DO. [ LAUGHTER ] DO THEY LOVE THAT? &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: DO THEY UNDERSTAND THAT PROCESS, THAT YOU DRAW SOMETHING AND IT BECOMES THEIR CLOTHES? &gt;&gt; MY DAUGHTER WENT TO A FASHION CAMP FOR FIVE DAYS A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. AND I VISITED HER, AND WE PUT -- TOGETHER WE PUT THE THREAD THROUGH THE SEWING MACHINE. AND IT REALLY BROUGHT ME TO TEARS TO THINK ABOUT THE 15 YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON APPAREL AND FOR MY FRIEND VIRGIL TO BE THE HEAD OF LOUIS VUITTON, FOR ME TO HAVE THIS, YOU KNOW, $1.8 BILLION COMPANY OUT OF, YOU KNOW, A THREAD GOING THROUGH. AND SHE -- MY DAUGHTER ASKED ME, DADDY, DO YOU HAVE A SEWING MACHINE LIKE THIS AT YOUR OFFICE? AND I BROUGHT HER TO MY OFFICE. AND SHE DID A BUNCH OF SKETCHES. AND MY HEAD PATTERN CUTTER MADE HER DRESSES RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: REALLY. &gt;&gt; FOR HER. SO SHE LOVES COMING TO THE OFFICE AND DOING SKETCHES. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: BOY, THAT'S SO MUCH MORE FUN THAN MY DAD'S OFFICE. [ LAUGHTER ] ONE OF THE SONGS ON YOUR ALBUM IS ABOUT -- YOU'RE IN THE SONG, CORRECT ME IF I HAVE ANY OF THIS WRONG. YOU'RE IMAGINING YOUR DAUGHTER AS AN ADULT DATING AND MEN LOOKING AT HER. &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: AND YOU'RE VERY, VERY WORKED UP ABOUT THIS. &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: PREMATURELY SOME MIGHT SAY. DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? YOU THINK THAT FAR AHEAD? &gt;&gt; OH, I THINK LIFETIMES AND LIFETIMES AHEAD. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: AND THAT -- AND YOU ACTUALLY ARE IMAGINING LIKE GUYS OBJECTIFYING -- DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS WOMEN HAS CHANGED SINCE HAVING DAUGHTERS? &gt;&gt; NAH, I STILL LOOK AT PORN HUB. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; Jimmy: WHAT KIND OF STUFF DO YOU LOOK AT, WHAT CATEGORIES? [ LAUGHTER ] &gt;&gt; BLACK IS MY FAVORITE CATEGORY. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, YOU CAN IF YOU WANT. &gt;&gt; HEY, I MEAN, WHAT'S THE POINT OF BEING KANYE WEST IF YOU CAN'T? &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YEAH, LET'S HAVE IT. &gt;&gt; A LOT OF BLACK ON WHITE, OBVIOUSLY. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: OH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S MIRRORING YOUR OWN SELF, YOUR OWN SITUATION. &gt;&gt; MY OWN REALITY. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: RIGHT. IT'S LIKE BUBBLY MASTURBATING IN A WAY IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU DO THAT? [ LAUGHTER ] I NEED THAT DOUBLE -- &gt;&gt; Jimmy: I'LL SHOW YOU AFTER THE SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ] &gt;&gt; NO, I DON'T WANT TO. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOU HAVE SOME REALLY HEAVY SONGS. ONE OF THEM IS CALLED &quot;I THOUGHT ABOUT KILLING YOU.&quot; IS THAT SONG ABOUT SOMEBODY IN PARTICULAR? AND IS IT ME? [ LAUGHTER ] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, SOMEONE E-MAILED ME AFTER THAT SONG CAME OUT AND SAID THAT THEY HAD -- THEIR MOM HAD PASSED AWAY AND THAT THEY HAD TAKEN 60 PILLS. AND THAT THEY TRIED TO KILL THEMSELVES. AND THEY WROTE AT THE END OF IT, &quot;PREMEDITATED MURDER.&quot; SO IT'S -- &gt;&gt; Jimmy: AND THAT IS A REFRAIN, YOU SAY PREMEDITATED MURDER. THAT CAME FROM SOMEBODY WRITING YOU? &gt;&gt; NO. AFTER THE SONG CAME OUT. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: AFTER. &gt;&gt; BUT SAYING THAT THIS PERSON TAKING THESE PILLS AND TRYING TO KILL THEMSELVES WAS A FORM OF PREMEDITATED MURDER. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: SURE. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT I SAID IS LIKE, PEOPLE ARE SO AFRAID TO FACE WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DEALING WITH, WHETHER IT'S OPIOID ADDICTION, WHETHER IT'S SUICIDE, WHETHER IT'S ALL THESE THINGS. WE JUST WANT TO LIKE -- WE WANT TO PUT A PATINA ON IT AND NOT FACE IT. AND I THINK THE BREAK THROUGH FOR THAT ALBUM FOR ME -- I DON'T DO OLD VERSIONS OF MUSIC, I'M LOOKING TO DO SOMETHING NEW. THE BREAKTHROUGH WAS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A SONG CALLED &quot;I THOUGHT ABOUT KILLING YOU&quot; IN THIS LIKE SUPER-PC, HOLLYWOOD, YOU CAN'T SAY NOTHING WRONG DAY AND AGE. IT'S LIKE, KANYE WEST'S FIRST SONG 80 THOUGHT ABOUT KILLING YOU&quot; AND TAKE YOU THROUGH THE THOUGHTS. THE OTHER DAY I TWEETED HOW TO NOT KILL YOURSELF PART 1. WHEN YOU'RE AN ARTIST AND YOU'RE CREATIVE AND YOU WANT TO GIVE SO MUCH TO THE WORLD AGAINST ALL ODDS THERE'S TIMES WHEN YOU CAN GO INTO THAT PLACE. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT THE HOW TO WAS, DON'T BE AROUND PEOPLE WHO MAKE YOU WANT TO KILL YOURSELF, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YEAH. GOOD ADVICE. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE. I WAS INSPIRED AFTER SEEING THIS ALEXANDER McQUEEN FILM. THIS WAS A BEAUTIFUL, AMAZING ARTIST THAT KILLED HIMSELF. HE'D ALWAYS TALK ABOUT IT. HE DESIGNED HIS OWN BASKET. I THOUGHT ABOUT A TOMBSTONE THAT SAID &quot;ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?&quot; &gt;&gt; Jimmy: IT'S FUNNY BUT NOT FUNNY, REALLY, THOUGH. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: BECAUSE, YOU KNOW -- WHEN YOU HAVE THOUGHTS LIKE THAT, YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL AND TALK TO PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. BUT YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL -- WELL, NOT BE CAREFUL. JUST BE EXPRESSIVE AND UNDERSTAND THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE SENSITIVE PEOPLE. LIKE YOU GET THESE CELEBRITIES AND THEY GET A BAD PHOTO AND EVERYONE JUST TEARS THEM ALL THE WAY TO SHREDS AND YOU FORGET THIS IS A DAUGHTER, A SON, A MOM, A DAD. AND YOU KNOW, I THINK I FIGHT FOR -- I FIGHT FOR ALL OF US. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOU HAVE A LOT OF EMPATHY, I GUESS, IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU'RE THINKING. &gt;&gt; I DO. I DO HAVE A LOT OF EMPATHY. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YEAH, ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt;&gt; WE'RE BACK WITH KANYE WEST. THIS IS HIS ALBUM CALLED &quot;YE.&quot; A BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPH. YOU RECORDED THIS IN JACKSON HOLE, WYOMING. YOU PUT OUT FIVE OTHER ALBUMS WITH OTHER ARTISTS THAT YOU PRODUCED BASICALLY WITHIN LIKE, WHAT, A MONTH-LONG PERIOD OF TIME. THAT'S A TON OF WORK. ARE YOU LIKE -- ARE YOU A WORKAHOLIC? ARE YOU ALWAYS WORKING? &gt;&gt; NO, I ACTUALLY SLEPT A LOT DURING THE PROJECT. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: WHILE THEY WERE RECORDING? &gt;&gt; YEAH. I HAVE A TEAM, WE WORKED TOGETHER. I SPENT A YEAR AND A HALF AFTER I GOT OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. AND I WOULD GO TO AMOEBA RECORD STORE AND START CHOPPING UP SAMPLES. IT'S VERY THERAPEUTIC BECAUSE I WASN'T FULL YE -- I DON'T KNOW IF I'M FULL YE NOW, BETTER OR WORSE OR WHATEVER. BUT IT WAS THERAPEUTIC JUST TO LISTEN TO THOSE SONGS AND SAMPLE AND GO BACK TO BEING 14 YEARS OLD AT MY MOM'S HOUSE. AND BY THE TIME IT'S TIME TO DO -- TO PUT THE ALBUMS OUT, WE HAVE A WHOLE TEAM AT YEEZY SOUND THAT WILL HELP COME AND DO THE DRUMS, HELP WITH LYRICS, HELP WITH CHORUSES. I HAD TO GIVE LIKE SIX, SEVEN PEOPLE IDEAS THAT I WANT ON THE SONG. AND I'D JUST GO TO SLEEP AND JUST WAIT FOR THEM -- &gt;&gt; Jimmy: THEM WORKING WHILE YOU SLEEP, THAT'S A HARD WORKER RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE YOU AVOIDED THIS ALBUM TITLE. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: OH, YEAH, I DON'T -- &quot;I HATE BEING BIPOLAR, IT'S AWESOME.&quot; I HAVE A THEORY ABOUT YOU, TELL ME IF THIS IS CORRECT. I FEEL YOU FEEL BY BEING BIPOLAR IS PART WHAT WAS MAKES YOU BRILLIANT, PART OF WHAT MAKES YOU YOU, AND YOU EMBRACE IT. &gt;&gt; YEAH, I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIKE, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT? THE FUNNY THING IS, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS LIKE ON THE INTERNET BEFORE. IT WAS KIND OF FUNNY. BUT IT'S NOT AN OPPOSITE. IT'S NOT I HATE BEING BIPOLAR. IT'S AWESOME. IT ACTUALLY DRIVES MORE OF HOW YOU REALLY FEEL. IT DOESN'T DO THE OPPOSITE THING. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT, YOU KNOW -- OPEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH. ESPECIALLY WITH ME BEING BLACK. BECAUSE WE NEVER HAD THERAPISTS IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. WE NEVER APPROACHED LIKE TAKE A MEDICATION. I THINK IT'S GOOD WHEN I HAD MY FIRST COMPLETE BLACKOUT AT AGE 5, MY MOM DIDN'T FULLY MEDICATE ME. BECAUSE I MIGHT HAVE NEVER BEEN YE. AND THERE'S TIMES WHERE AT LEAST I'M HAPPY THAT I KNOW. LIKE EVEN LIKE FOR THIS INTERVIEW, I KNEW I WANTED TO STAY IN A EQUAL STATE. BECAUSE BY THE TIME I GOT TO TMZ I WAS RAMPED UP. WHAT WAS AWESOME IS THE WORLD GOT TO REALLY EXPERIENCE SOMEONE IN A RAMPED-UP STATE. AND THAT'S WHEN YOU GET THESE COMMENTS THAT JUST SHOOT OUT, ALMOST LIKE TOURETTE'S. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: BECAUSE YOU HAVE HIGHS AND LOWS. WHEN YOU HAVE A HIGH, YOU'RE ON A ROLL. WHEN YOU HAVE A LOW, YOU'RE NOT? &gt;&gt; WELL, THERE'S SOME CASES OF BIPOLAR WHERE PEOPLE GO LOW. I'M ONE THAT GOES HIGH. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: I SEE. &gt;&gt; LIKE MICHELLE OBAMA SAID, GO HIGH. [ LAUGHTER ] ? YOU DON'T HAVE EXTREME PERIODS OF DEPRESSION? &gt;&gt; OH, NO. BECAUSE I JUST SAY IT. I SAY IT ON REAL TV. OH, I THOUGHT ABOUT KILLING MYSELF. THEN THE THOUGHT IS GONE. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: SO ALL PEOPLE NEED TO DO IS GET ON TV, THAT'S REALLY THE SOLUTION. &gt;&gt; THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES WITHOUT FEAR OF JUDGMENT. WHAT I LOVE TELLING PEOPLE IS LIKE, WHO DO YOU KNOW -- YEAH, ESPECIALLY BLACK MEN. YOU KNOW, I'M 41 YEARS OLD. AND I DON'T KNOW ANYONE, YOU KNOW, THAT [ BLEEP ]ED UP AS MUCH AS I HAVE THAT'S STILL AS SUCCESSFUL. I WANT TO PROVE THAT YOU COULD GET FAT, YOU COULD SAY THE WRONG THINGS, YOU CAN PISS A WHOLE [ BLEEP ] CITY OFF -- &gt;&gt; Jimmy: AND BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. &gt;&gt; WELL -- YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; Jimmy: THERE'S ONE PERSON. KANYE WEST, EVERYBODY. THIS IS HIS ALBUM. IT'S CALLED &quot;YE.&quot;
