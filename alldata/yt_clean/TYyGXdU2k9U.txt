Ceres and Vesta as seen from Dawn Mission! Do you know what's the difference between And what's the definition we give for an asteroid? The terminology for various objects in the many objects, such as Pluto, were initially We can actually say that the definition of develop better ideas of what things are and As we expand our knowledge, we are able to That's why is important to study our solar investigate unknown environments and worlds. For example, if the astronomical union didn't Pluto would still be classified as a normal Sometimes, the nomenclature can make the difference: planet, and we would be looking for planet If you think about it, it is just a matter Or is it? ============================================================ Nowadays the definition of a dwarf planet The first requirement a body should fulfil it must orbit another object. Secondly, it must have a kind of spherical This is actually a consequence of the fact The more massive an object is, the more likely Last but not least, a dwarf planet has not What does this mean? This means that they share an orbital space and are not gravitationally dominant. The most famous example of a dwarf planet a planet but was redefined. The definition of an asteroid is quite different. They are particles of rock and metal that Asteroids can be stony or iron-nickel, although elements. They can both orbit a planet or travel through in high eccentric orbits. If an asteroid enters the atmosphere of Earth, a meteorite. Unlikely dwarf planets, asteroids are often to have a spherical shape. Today we can make a clear distinction between said before, our nomenclature and our definitions universe. And sometimes a mission or a new study can think about - things. This happened in 2006 when the IAU (international definition of a dwarf planet because we were - so to speak - of our solar system. The famous Dawn Mission was the first probe Dawn was a space probe. It left Earth in Sep. 2007 with the goal of of the asteroid belt: Vesta and Ceres. So, after some years - four, to be exact It was 2011. It chilled and orbit around Vesta collecting It was a nice trip, I'm not gonna lie. It completed a 14-month survey mission before Vesta looked really nice. These are some pictures of it. Look how beautiful! (show some pictures) https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_feature/public/images/685735main_pia15678-43_full.jpg 2015 was the year of Ceres, and again everything So smoothly that in 2017 NASA announced that until the probe's hydrazine fuel supply was This happened on November 1, 2018, when the a derelict in orbit around Ceres. This means that if you happen to pass by Ceres, orbiting around the dwarf planet. Dawn was a Guinness world record probe: it bodies, the first spacecraft to visit either planet. It was also the first NASA exploratory mission enter and leave the orbit of two celestial Previous multi-target missions using conventional restricted to flybys. The two bodies studied by Dawn, Ceres and between the formation of rocky planets and what conditions a rocky planet can hold water. The second probe to ever visit a dwarf planet Pluto. Let's see what we know about Ceres and Vesta. Both of them are objects in the asteroid belt. Ceres alone comprises a third of the total This means that, compared to other asteroids In fact, it is not an asteroid, but a dwarf Ceres is named for the Roman goddess of corn I'm gonna tell you something: the word cereal By studying the spectrum coming from Ceres, similar to that of a chondrite. A water-rich carbonaceous one. To understand this a bit more, fragments of Ceres was called an asteroid for many years, dwarf planet. Even though Ceres comprises 25% of the asteroid Just for comparison, Pluto is still 14 times Also, this dwarf planet is really interesting Here on Earth, water is essential for life, and a few other conditions met, life possibly And hey, stop being that pessimistic! Even if Ceres does not have living things in the past! Ceres takes 1,682 Earth days, or 4.6 Earth As Ceres orbits the Sun, it completes one one of the shortest in the solar system. Imagine waking up, going to school, having this in 9 hours! It would be a nightmare! We think Ceres formed along with the rest ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust Scientists say that if Ceres was a bit luckier, They refer to it as a planet embryo, which finish. Ceres is more similar to the terrestrial planets asteroid neighbours. It probably has a solid core and a mantle In fact, Ceres could be composed of as much If that is correct, Ceres has more water than As regards the surface, Ceres is covered in However, they are not so big. None of them is larger than 175 miles (280 They are craters formed after collisions with in the primordial circumstellar disk from The lack of big craters might be due to layers The surface features could smooth out over such as salt, is just below the surface. It's also possible that past hydrothermal large craters. There are also certain regions on Ceres' surface These are called "cold traps" and they Imagine for example having craters on the Within some of them, there could be regions sun! It's possible that without direct sunlight, them for long periods of time. Well, this was pretty much all we knew about But what about Vesta? First, it is named Vesta after the goddess It holds the record as the second most massive for almost nine of the total mass of all asteroids. What Dawn mission found is that Vesta is that is nearly classified as a dwarf planet. It is actually a very peculiar asteroid. Unlike most of them, Vesta has separated into called differentiation - much like Earth. The Dawn mission wanted to unveil the secrets how and why the differentiation happened. Luckily, we have an answer. If you are here watching this video, it means and the mysteries of the universe. We constantly strive to make videos that excite and be sure to press the bell notification! The answer is that Vesta formed early, within system. Short-lived radioactive material that was this epoch heated them to the point where to sink to the asteroid's core and the lower according to Archimede's principle. Vesta is made of bright materials and dark The bright materials seem to be native rocks, been deposited by other asteroids crashing A lot of collisions took place on Vesta during Statistical studies from Dawn mission suggest ranging from one to 10 km (0.6 to six miles) We know a lot about the interior and the surface Eucrite and Diogenite. These are strange names given to meteorites They are therefore crucial and provide clues that was tested and enhanced by the information and interior. Vesta is believed to have lost about one per ago in a massive collision responsible for miles (500 kilometres) wide. This 3-D image, called an anaglyph, shows the central complex To create this anaglyph, two differently coloured create depth. When viewed through red-blue glasses this The images used to generate the two differently were obtained during the approach phase of At the time the distance from Dawn to Vesta which results in an image resolution of about Vesta was discovered at Bremen, Germany, on who had previously discovered Pallas. He proposed--incorrectly as it turned out--that planet, and found Vesta as he searched for Vesta was the fourth asteroid ever to be discovered. &quot;This video ends here!
