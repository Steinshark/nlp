Of a man born in obscurity (singing) We know so little about him-- more than 2,000 years ago, We know he was baptized And we know that &gt;&gt; (dramatized): that even the winds &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: With so little archaeologists must sift and scholars decode the first followers of Jesus. &gt;&gt; The problem for any historian the life of Jesus is simply that come from the actual time &gt;&gt; The historian's task and the Jesus movement is a lot like in excavating a tell. You peel back layer after layer and what you always find &gt;&gt; History isn't made of a person like Jesus. Jesus is very much like most who have ever existed poor, obscure, or distinction of any kind. They live under and they die that way. There's nothing historically Billions of people pass through in exactly that way. &gt;&gt; We can tell the story the earliest Christians by the way<i> they</i> by the way that<i> &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Central Jesus was born a subject &gt;&gt; (dramatized): a decree went out that all the world &gt;&gt; Jesus was born of the emperor Augustus of the<i> Pax Romana,</i> And on every coin that Augustus <i> divi filius,</i> Julius Caesar, son of God. &gt;&gt; This is on every billboard He is the savior of the world, Now, you may have scruples but he brings peace to Rome, &quot;Peace to the Rome &gt;&gt; (dramatized): This is he, who shall restore the golden age &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Rome's empire sweeping through North Africa as Spain. To the east, Turkey, Greece, and Palestine, in the Jewish land of Judea, &gt;&gt; In Judea, the king, Herod, He ruled He was the voice of Rome, probably &quot;instrument of Rome&quot; because he had his own &gt;&gt; Herod the Great was probably of the post-biblical period but you wouldn't want your He was ambitious, brutal, &gt;&gt; And it is one of the real that this man, in Jewish history, really, on the face &gt;&gt; It appears that Herod thought He really wanted to make it just as people would have gone or the great cities &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: A meticulously of ancient Jerusalem shows of Herod's building program. &gt;&gt; And so, or helped to rebuild the city, And this can be seen &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: We know exactly how detailed descriptions of Along the coast, 40 miles long. It brought water In honor Herod named the city Caesarea. &gt;&gt; We really need to get Caesarea Maritima precisely because it shows of Roman rule &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In this thriving its culture and commerce, of daily life. &gt;&gt; In the middle of the city complete with the capital, that is, the personification The political reality of the day overseeing the life &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Into this political The Gospels present the familiar &gt;&gt; (dramatized): And she gave and wrapped him and laid him in a manger because in the inn. &gt;&gt; Our best guess for the birth In other words, he was born of Herod the Great, But I emphasize &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The Gospels claim Historians think it is and grew up near in the village &gt;&gt; The region was known of political activity, In the last few generations the Galilee has achieved for being you know, the, I don't know... &gt;&gt; The Galilee, by most of is always portrayed peasants on the hillsides. And yet our recent have shown this Nazareth stands from a major urban center, Sepphoris was founded And so it was really invested, with all the trappings &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Recent at Sepphoris challenge of Jesus' life. &gt;&gt; One of the more exciting at Sepphoris was with a gorgeous, gorgeous mosaic in a banquet hall. The lady was dubbed &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; because she is really of a beautiful woman And the picture we get in the mainstream, but Sepphoris was not just a city and things like that, but it had Nazareth, to all intents and attached to the region &gt;&gt; The findings really to rethink Jesus' social, because we really had really out in the hinterland, especially Roman-influenced What the excavations that Jesus was quite proximate urban environment that would all of the diversity and would have required, as the price of doing business, that one would not have the humble carpenter. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Scholars today of Jesus the humble carpenter, and disagree &gt;&gt; (dramatized): They were &quot;Where did this man Is not this &gt;&gt; The difficulty for us in is that we immediately think of and, at least in North America, making a very high income. As soon as we take that we are totally lost, there was no middle class There were the &quot;haves&quot; to put it very simply. And in the anthropology to say that somebody is is not to compliment them. It is to say that they are lower than a peasant farmer. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Very few scholars that Jesus was &gt;&gt; I'm not entirely convinced as a peasant. I think that that probably especially in view of the more at Sepphoris and elsewhere. &gt;&gt; He must be someone if he's working And in all probability, where he might grow up he likely went to Sepphoris And this puts him in that would have been of a city like Sepphoris-- through the marketplace, And Sepphoris itself, as a city, that Jesus was growing up &gt;&gt; You couldn't deal and wheel or in the market without knowing And I can hardly imagine who wouldn't know some Greek. Jesus was trilingual. Jesus participated in both and its literatures, Hellenistic Greek to do his business &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Despite Sepphoris was And Jesus remained faithful when he left Nazareth &gt;&gt; (dramatized): and taught them, saying, &quot;Do not think I have come to &quot;I have come not to abolish &gt;&gt; What we learned is not that Quite the opposite. He's completely embedded &gt;&gt; Was Jesus a Jew? Of course Jesus was a Jew. He was born of a Jewish part of the world. All of his friends, associates, all of them were Jews. He regularly worshipped what we call synagogues. He preached from Jewish texts, He celebrated Jewish festivals. He was born, lived, died, Nowadays, there are temples and There's not a Jewish community a synagogue, and many In this period, however, that there is only one temple. And that's (people conversing &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: For Jews living the temple in Jerusalem of their religious life. &gt;&gt; The Jewish historian Josephus He says, The Jews saw themselves one God alone, of this one special people And that's a very powerful idea, accurately, I think-- that the temple was within the Jewish community. This was the one, the one place on earth and the heavens somehow descend just enough that This was the only one place where this was so. &gt;&gt; The temple in Jerusalem was of the country. Jews everywhere, if they were pious, would it's sort of like, oh, the way you'd put aside money having a party in Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Although the temple of Jewish life and worship, Judaism was not &gt;&gt; There's no such thing It's not a monolithic religious Indeed, what we're seeing more and the archaeological is how diverse Judaism was &gt;&gt; Sometimes reading ancient family quarrels (whispering) And some of I can say this because I don't but the most endearing aspects that we still have is I mean, people who weren't absolutely firm opinions on how their business. (distant conversations) &gt;&gt; There will have been in Jerusalem, and perhaps These are who took their religious of what Judaism was and turned political agenda. &quot;We must destroy the Roman &quot;who cooperate &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: We now know had even more extreme views, on Jesus' own message. &gt;&gt; One of the best examples of that's at work in Judaism is, of course, now what we know of the Dead Sea Scrolls. As you leave Jerusalem and toward the Dead Sea, rapidly and starkly. You move off gradually through the ravines, and it becomes It's dry, it's arid, And then, all of a sudden, only about 13 miles, drops out in front of you It is in that rugged cliff face that the Dead Sea Scrolls at the site known as Khirbet The Dead Sea Scrolls are usually by a group known as the Essenes. And the Essenes are a group that it seems, in protest the temple was being run. And they go to the desert to get the worldliness of Jerusalem and &gt;&gt; The manual of discipline, envisages a community living a community that is that is governed very strictly. There is an oath of entry. It is very much &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Everyone who the congregation of the elect to live according to love all and to hate &gt;&gt; The Essenes are an apocalyptic sect of Judaism. An apocalyptic sect is one first of all, (whispers) &gt;&gt; By apocalyptic expectation, an<i> apocalupsis,</i> in Greek: is going to finally solve injustice, unrighteousness, by totally eradicating the evil. That's the terrible price there's going to be a lot of totally eradicating evil, whoever we are, be it heaven on earth, in justice and holiness &gt;&gt; Among the Dead Sea Scrolls, but at least two messiahs. Some of their writings talk a priestly figure who will come at Jerusalem to its proper But there's also that is a kind of to lead the war. &gt;&gt; The Qumran scrolls reveal for the end of days. The best known one, perhaps, &quot;The War of the Sons of Light And, at some point, a cataclysmic struggle, but also between cosmic forces-- the cosmic forces of evil And, needless to say, for the sons of light-- in other words, &gt;&gt; Now, we typically think in the end of the world, but, what they thought. They use language like or &quot;the last days,&quot; the present evil age This is really more of the present social order, to a kind of golden age So it's really kind of It's not otherworldly. In fact, when it comes, and right now. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: History offers influenced by the Essenes, struck chords that reverberated and echoed through known as John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): In those days, in the wilderness of Judea, &quot;Repent, for the Kingdom &gt;&gt; John the Baptist was it appears, from the way But he seems of a kind of prophetic figure, So he is usually thought of wearing unusual clothes-- &gt;&gt; John is taking people out Crossing the Jordan, and he is planting of apocalyptic expectation waiting for God to strike, (faint whispering) &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It was as John's that Jesus submitted of baptism. &gt;&gt; The evidence that Jesus is as strong as anything The reason is a certain trying to explain why on earth inferior to John. If he goes then somehow we have to explain &gt;&gt; The Gospels then go on to say predicted by John. Most contemporary scholars would developed by the early church between the two. &gt;&gt; The difference I see between to use some fancy John is an apocalyptic An eschatologist that the problem that it's going to take some God is going to descend in some to solve the world. There is another type and that's what I think I'm going to call it That is the demand not us on God to do something &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: We don't know Jesus remained faithful but at some point after Jesus seems to have embarked &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Jesus went teaching in the synagogues the good news of the kingdom, and every sickness &gt;&gt; Jesus' career apparently was and villages and a few small of the Galilee, his home region. &gt;&gt; Jesus' ministry in the but I think we can begin to get of it through archaeology and through higher literary Those villages there to his ministry. He's avoiding the big towns, probably because the elements are of such a high class that in Jesus' message. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: a simple man of the people or Jesus does seem to have pitched and to have impressed them &gt;&gt; Healings, seems to have been for which he had people would bring-- from miles around, they'd bring their sick, to Jesus to be healed. &gt;&gt; I love the story and picking up the dust and and forming a kind of healing And it's also interesting that Jesus sort of misses the mark that he's applying. So one finds the intrusions in these Jesus traditions through natural processes &gt;&gt; Now, we need to be aware that around at the time, so just is not in itself unique. &gt;&gt; In the first century, including, later in the century, when he was becoming were miracle workers What really was unusual why would God work That sort of struck as unbelievable. Not that there would but that miracles by a Jewish peasant. &gt;&gt; Jesus limited his circulation And his teaching was that would be readily understood &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Jesus said &quot;Give them something to eat.&quot; They replied: &quot;We have nothing here And he said, &gt;&gt; The feeding of the multitudes that's told in all four gospels. That's a story near and dear Jesus goes into He takes And it's there that even though there are He multiplies to feed Well, I don't think to figure out why is so endearing to poor people. I mean, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Behind the simple of the coming Kingdom of God, an enigma Jesus &gt;&gt; Jesus tells a parable about somebody plants it in the ground, a great tree, a weed, though, Now, imagine an audience Presumably the kingdom and they have to figure out, &quot;You mean, the kingdom is big? &quot;But you just said &quot;So why don't you say &quot;Why a big weed? &quot;And besides, this mustard... &quot;we're not certain &quot;It's very dangerous &quot;We try to... &quot;We try to contain it. &quot;What do you mean the kingdom &quot;the people try to control Every reaction in the audience, with themselves, as it were, is doing exactly what he wants. It's making them think, but about the kingdom. But the trap is that this even a weird, To say the kingdom everyone would yawn, say, &quot;It's like a mustard seed.&quot; &quot;What's going on here?&quot; &gt;&gt; Either people will tend to as some sort of social reformer, preaching a coming And yet, it must be recognized that those are very different kinds and yet both are reflected &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He may have He may have preached Either way, Jesus was bound with the Roman authorities. &gt;&gt; The core of Jesus' preaching And the difficulty for us as 100% political Not one, not the other. In the first century, those were <i> The</i> kingdom, if you used that would, meant the Roman kingdom. It meant the Roman empire. When you talked about and were somehow setting it up with the Roman empire, a very caustic criticism and you were saying the system of God. &gt;&gt; The Jewish historian Josephus about characters whose career as following: some guy wakes up in the morning or something, he gets a group of people He says, &quot;We're going to go out &quot;wait for God to do So, a whole bunch of people may go with him out to this and they wait for &quot;the tokens And the Romans send a vicious and kill everybody. When that kind of police action what we might consider the Romans are really giving us in how domination works. &gt;&gt; All the time I cannot not imagine to be put to death. Everything that he is doing If you are following Jesus' life you should be &quot;Somebody is going &gt;&gt; (dramatized): After he had going up to Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Moving to Jerusalem, Jesus ruled by Herod Antipas by Rome through a prefect, &gt;&gt; Pontius Pilate was and so that places us within the early period These are some of our most for the activities When Jesus actually died Some people would say maybe some others as late as 33, but we do know &gt;&gt;<i> Pontius Pilatus, Pontius Pilate, &gt;&gt; And we know of him and a fairly ruthless the area of Judea. And there are several episodes eschatological prophets emerge, in eliminating them, of potential conflict (murmur of crowd) &gt;&gt; People from went to Jerusalem on Passover. It's one of the most populated It's a madhouse. There are extra animals being because of the Passover holiday. There are pilgrims coming in And Jesus comes up to town, too. He could have stayed home but he didn't. He's up in Jerusalem Pilate would get nervous when and, of course, he was legally in Jerusalem when it was He would leave this very nice, which was, you know, plenty of pagan altars, and have to go up where all these Jews and stay there for crowd control He was in a bad mood already and Passover would fray (murmur of crowd) &gt;&gt; If you were a pilgrim coming you would walk of this magnificent city. As you approach you come up to this massive, that we call the temple, up which one can go And you come out up in the outer precincts (singing) The soldiers that were would have been stationed called the Antonia, to the temple complex They could keep an eye everyone in the temple knew &gt;&gt; Particularly at Passover, with this incredible of national and the Roman soldiers of the temple looking down So it's a politically and &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Then, Jesus all who were selling and buying and he overturned the tables &gt;&gt; The difficulty with the story in the temple is that in slightly different ways For example, in Mark's gospel, in Matthew, Mark, and Luke-- this event occurs and is clearly the event to the attention and the Roman authorities. It is, in effect, John's gospel, puts the story of the cleansing as the very first episode more than two years earlier, near his death. So, there are a few problems although it is in all the Gospels, &gt;&gt; It's unclear how he actually He wouldn't have of the priests because, the Pharisees are what Jesus is doing If he had been complaining or criticizing them, the temple was being run, it's business as usual. This is one of the aspects &gt;&gt; Another possibility, though, more like the Essenes, who were really the temple is run as having too caught up or maybe just too Roman. And if that's the case, like an act &gt;&gt; Try and imagine It was both the house of God It was the high priest Caiaphas with the Roman occupation. Now, how would Jesus, see the temple? I think On the one hand, and you would die to defend it like Caligula putting But what would you do when where Caiaphas collaborated Was the temple<i> really</i> What Jesus does is not he symbolically destroys it. &gt;&gt; If you really think the end that has a kind of that goes along with it. It's not good for quiet crowds And given the emotional of this holiday anyway, that the Kingdom of God perhaps it was going to be within that very holiday-- preaching that it's the equivalent of shouting &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: that this politically charged for his arrest, and the role played remains unclear. &gt;&gt; I think between the chief priests The chief priests with Rome They're mediating and the people. Then there was a perceived on the verge of some kind of People would get hurt or killed And perhaps for this reason, &gt;&gt; The most difficult thing is to bring when we're looking because we want to think or all of the Roman empire or all of I take it for granted between Pilate and Caiaphas lower-class especially, at Passover. &gt;&gt; Jesus would have represented, and resistor that he had been dealing and with varying degrees obviously. But Jesus would have been a blip because the unrest were so common-- for the Roman that Jesus would have been seen, as very, very little &gt;&gt; Now, I don't for a moment been worried the power of the emperor. That's not the point. The point is, any challenge any challenge to the peace with a swift &gt;&gt; In dealing with a person Pilate had considerable leeway. He was probably driven and that is the process through crucifixion. &gt;&gt; There is no doubt in my mind for the actual execution The Romans practiced It was, while it was not it was not a form &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Then they called Golgotha, which means &gt;&gt; A crucifixion site a main road into the city. It was a warning location. The uprights for the crosses permanently. And you have to think of where people would go regularly. It's an abhorrent site. It's supposed to be a warning, even when nobody So the idea that there would be leave out Passover just watching, would probably avert their eyes because they don't of the Romans who are killing one more good Jew who had been crucified in the &gt;&gt; Death by crucifixion an awful, awful experience It was slow, it was painful, &gt;&gt; It's not from bleeding. It's not that the death occurs. It's rather a suffocation because one can't hold oneself And so, over time, really, it's the exposure and the gradual loss of breath &gt;&gt; We don't have about the actual crucifixion What we have are the stories And they're, the gospel writers psalms that, are often cries to God. And that's, they're grabbing to shape their narrative Those are cries They're really appeals The words that are put &quot;Why have you forsaken me?&quot; It's the religious power that is really one of those wonderful moments between what this very first-century Jew as he was dying on the cross of passionate religious and asking God what happened. (singing) &gt;&gt; The plaque is one of the few clear pieces that we have. &gt;&gt;<i> Iesus Nazereno, rex iudorum.</i> &gt;&gt; The plaque, which names him suggests that the charge on was one of political a threat to the<i> Pax Romana.</i> But he's also now a victim (singing) &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In the year 51 by the shores of the Aegean Sea, at the Greek city of Corinth. His name was Paul of Tarsus. &gt;&gt; Let's imagine Paul going up through the monumental Roman the center of city life, and most are done in the public life Here are the shops. Here are the offices And we are standing of the great temple of Apollo. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Apollo, watched over Like Zeus, Hera, Artemis, Apollo was one of that family of divinities the ancient &gt;&gt; Paganism is our designation of the people Jews are a visible minority. And then, everybody is doing &gt;&gt; One would have found of deities meeting the various It's like going to a supermarket to sort of shop for god. And you have them at various and for various functions &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: By the time pilgrims had been worshipping like the sacred spring To devout pagans like these, of a Jewish messiah come Jew and gentile alike, &gt;&gt; And so &quot;I've determined to know &quot;but Jesus Christ, Jesus that must have struck among these who would've inhabited &gt;&gt; (dramatized): I am a Jew, educated strictly according being zealous about God. &gt;&gt; The apostle Paul is, clearly the most intriguing of Christianity, because he wrote all &gt;&gt; (dramatized): For as long and drink the cup, until He comes. Wait for his son from heaven, Whatever is honorable, whatever if there is anything think about these things. &gt;&gt; We're beginning to get, in the New Testament, the hallmark of all You see, it's Paul who starts by writing letters to these in the cities of the Greek east. &gt;&gt; Paul alludes in a number that he would have communicated He emphasizes two things: very clearly, and resurrection of Jesus; he also emphasizes the end time and the immediacy and that one must be And the way one prepares for it We find a lot of ethics And it's around this issue of of the end time that's just &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The death lie at the very heart but it is a story and goes back in Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Joseph took in a clean linen cloth, which he had hewn in the rock. &gt;&gt; The movement must have suffered a traumatic Not so much that but that nothing happened. The kingdom as they might have expected. &gt;&gt; The effect that on Jesus' followers from the Roman perspective. That is, that people with Jesus were terrified. I mean, before the Easter there must have been that folks were hiding out, because now they of an executed criminal. &gt;&gt; The followers of Jesus, as they're supposed to have to deal with that What does this mean we had all of these expectations How do we deal with this, but the shameful end &gt;&gt; The only place they can go, is into the Hebrew scriptures, and find out, &quot;Is it possible &quot;the messiah, the righteous one, any title they use of Jesus, &quot;is it possible that such a one &quot;persecuted, and executed?&quot; They go into the Hebrew what they find is that it's of being God's righteous one, and even executed. &gt;&gt; And the amazing thing is, &quot;He<i> was</i> the king of the Jews. &quot;And, moreover, God has &quot;that he is the king of the Jews &gt;&gt; (dramatized): descending from heaven, He said to the women: &quot;Jesus who was crucified, &quot;Come, see the place &gt;&gt; The stories about make two very clear points: that Jesus really, really and secondly, and with absolute conviction, The Gospels are equally clear I mean, even though a shut door or suddenly materializes his disciples are having, &quot;Touch me, feel me, In Luke, A ghost can't eat fish. As an historian, about whether Jesus himself But what it does give me is his followers and, into the leader into such &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Christianity began at a single moment in time. 50 days after the death of a miraculous event took place. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): And suddenly like the rush of a violent wind, where they were sitting. Divided tongues, as of fire, and a tongue rested &gt;&gt; That's the picture The historical reality And the Christian movement not from a single center, where different groups gathered and tried to make sense with him at the end &gt;&gt; The Acts' account of early a very cogent, coherent image when, in fact, the more we find the more wildly variegated &gt;&gt; As far as we can tell, occurred in in many different groups. There were wandering from door to door preaching depending on people with whom for food. There were settled groups There were radical groups trying and family life following It must have been amazingly diverse range. &gt;&gt; It's clear from the very there are different ways the fundamental message. There are different kinds There are arguments over How Greek are we to be? How do we adapt What is the real meaning How important Maybe it's the sayings of Jesus the important thing, and not his resurrection. (singing) &gt;&gt; And I think we're right the Jesus movement here, Christianity, that is, of the kind of movement that it would become we will miss the flavor of the kind of crude the small enclaves &gt;&gt; We're hampered We know that this group a gentile community, and But this group This group expected and establish &gt;&gt; He is a Jewish messiah. They are followers of They are expecting the coming It's a Jewish movement. &gt;&gt; The Jewish sect, sees itself as Jews, other Jews out there, out there have it all wrong. They don't fully understand and only the members &gt;&gt; Sectarian groups with their environment. That tension is manifested to want to spread to hit the road that the truth is real. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Go nowhere and enter no town but go rather to the lost sheep &gt;&gt; One of the characteristics there is suddenly more so than in any period And, in some ways, that will happen again, until &gt;&gt; (dramatized): As you go, has come near. &gt;&gt; One would have encountered or any other other a wonderful variety Some would be certainly engaged taking their commercial products Some would be involved taking their particular services One would have found One would have found persons preachers, missionaries and religious movements. What, in a sense, the network that was established of the Roman army finally became most instrumental &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Jews had traveled for centuries, spread throughout the empire. &gt;&gt; By the time there were probably then, outside the land of Israel There's a very energetic There is a very wealthy, living in the major cities It's because of extremely well established, as a new and of Judaism, as it does &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Paul himself Convinced that God had chosen about Jesus, the capital of Roman Syria. &gt;&gt; Antioch has one of outside of the Jewish homeland-- something like 40,000 people So we can, we must imagine Jewish congregations in and through which Paul and still felt very much at home &gt;&gt; Wherever you have you would have Wherever you have you would have &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: the synagogue had become But in Paul's day, it was more &gt;&gt; Another remarkable feature in the diaspora is not only large crowds of people, will have been gentiles. There is no barrier and gentiles found and the Jews themselves, as open, friendly, to the Jewish synagogue? Especially because there There's nothing equivalent anywhere in pagan &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Gentiles attending exposed to In Antioch, the Jesus movement, in some synagogues. Paul felt that the time to bring the gentiles &gt;&gt; Paul's message seems to be predicated of what will happen when the messiah has arrived, a light to the nations, And in that sense, having arrived with Jesus, of opportunity into the elect status &gt;&gt; Why do gentiles There's this tremendous thanks to the antiquity By entering into the church, into that history, as well. That's tremendously &gt;&gt; I think perhaps, originally, to the claims of salvation, You're baptized, Probably they were attracted and to the communities. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: the early followers of Jesus in each other's homes. &gt;&gt; Among the things that make are a couple of rituals before the very earliest sources One of these which they call baptism, that means &quot;dunking.&quot; The second major ritual a common meal which is designed as a memorial which Jesus had &gt;&gt; Now, the situation seems when people were attracted they first became Jews. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Becoming a Jew It meant conforming &gt;&gt; (dramatized): This is between the unclean and between the living creature and the living creature &gt;&gt; There are several issues One is the notion the eating restrictions for eating certain kinds of food also with whom one could eat. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In Paul's view, gentiles who didn't observe all to participate in the communal &gt;&gt; But because it's at a meal, into some Jewish sensitivities you can eat &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Dietary laws were that marked Jewish identity. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Every male and it shall be a sign between me and you. &gt;&gt; Of course, the major issues for a gentile, for a non-Jew, become circumcised. And, of course, if one is working out where everyone was nude So, the ritual of circumcision that people would've thought &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Paul argued could replace circumcision. This breakthrough allowed God's chosen people. &gt;&gt; We now have, Paul says, The old distinctions are now obliterated. They have now been supplanted and more wonderful in which we have a new Israel both the Jews and gentiles, the new covenant &gt;&gt; (dramatized): There is no There is no longer There is no longer for all of you are one &gt;&gt; And that would spark one of of the first generation: do you have to become a Jew of Jesus as the messiah? &gt;&gt; (dramatized): I went up and I laid before the gospel that I proclaim &gt;&gt; Paul says explicitly to meet with the leaders He calls them &quot;the pillars.&quot; &gt;&gt; We have some names of people the big shots in the movement: Now, this James is not of the apostles. This James is the brother &gt;&gt; It's somewhat surprising Jesus' own family members in Jerusalem precisely because, the family is usually portrayed toward his public ministry. At one point in Mark's gospel, and they try to take him away do himself some harm. And they go down to ask with these gentile converts? And they manage to get with the Jerusalem leadership. They agree that it's okay for and yet not to force them &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: As part Paul agreed to collect money to support the church &gt;&gt; So when Paul goes he seems to think in the understanding of what Shortly after his return Peter arrives from Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; One of the most vivid in the epistle to the Galatians, about a face-off &gt;&gt; A classic showdown of earliest Christianity. And Paul tells the story he says that in Antioch, who was having a meal Peter thought until the contingent &gt;&gt; And they tap Peter and Peter stops attending And then we get a great passage It's probably what Paul wishes to Peter at the time, it's presented And he's yelling at Peter and not being true to Christ to this vision of things, at Peter about is food. &gt;&gt; And the way Paul tells it is, &quot;Well, you know, &quot;I told him he was a hypocrite. &quot;I told him off to his face. &quot;I told him off End of story. Well, the story You know, after he told Peter off, to Jerusalem with his tail and then Paul gave James and then he threw them out, Nothing like that. Paul's completely silent. Now, this suggests to us had a showdown in Antioch. He did face off with Peter. He didn't win. He didn't carry the day, So, this suggests to us that and influential outside and that perhaps James' posse that their authority outside of the jurisdiction &gt;&gt; The blow-up in Antioch over is the turning point Paul left and went or Asia Minor, and Greece. For the next ten years, Paul will concentrate in this region It's probably Ephesus immediately around Ephesus his most important base Ephesus was The inscriptions and the buildings is really a crossroads throughout &gt;&gt; When you read you immediately think of you think of peasants, you think of farming. When you read Paul's letters, you think of the philosopher, you think of the city. &gt;&gt; In Paul's view, at least, the city was if you will, for Christianity. He has a way of coming back He has a way of and talking about and it was cities not just general It's important to understand, that it was that Christianity &gt;&gt; Paul mostly travels around of these congregations or he sends out his helpers people like Timothy and Titus, or check out what's or some place like that, and help start a new say, Colossae, or maybe up So, we have to imagine as a kind of beehive &gt;&gt; (dramatized): my relatives who were Greet my beloved Epaenetus, in Asia for Christ. Greet Apelles, greet Ampliatus, Greet Urbanus, our coworker in &gt;&gt; The traditional view of the early is that they are Early Marxist interpreters make a great to-do with this. It's a movement It's essentially But if you actually look and you look at Paul, the people who are named here you have Erastus, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: An ancient of Paul's follower Erastus in the ruins of Corinth. &gt;&gt; You have Gaius of Corinth, to let him be but the host to all All of the little household in his house at one time. You have Stephanos who have been host You have Lydia in Philippi, of purple goods, You have Prisca and Aquilla, is usually mentioned She must be a woman You begin to get quite a variety represented in these Not people You have, with the exception no one no one who would be You have no agricultural slaves of the hierarchy. But in the rest of the social you seem to have representatives So we begin to get a picture to use a modern anachronistic people who have mixed status, by the aristocracy outside not people who but in their own eyes than they are getting and have found within this and a role which is recognized. &gt;&gt; The worship of an early probably centered The term &quot;communion&quot; from this experience We also know that all other that we think of as going probably happened Paul refers to and another person Everyone is contributing whether it's or in the form &gt;&gt; Throughout the New Testament, and the Book of Acts, the houses in which This, I think, is significant who owned the houses were simply in effect, I think that this probably gave in actual roles in the church. &gt;&gt; Paul speaks of women as his and patrons and friends, But I don't see a picture of egalitarianism back there. I see a new, unformed, diverse, which allowed in certain roles-- in some places (singing) &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Paul's way of was just one of the Jesus movement. He had to fight his fledgling congregations the influence &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Who has bewitched you? &gt;&gt; His relationship is not entirely unproblematic. For one thing, a long distance relationship-- and we all know and he has to do this &gt;&gt; In his letters, he's often recapitulating fights he's had prior currently with his congregation. &gt;&gt; The early Christians did have and you see this The apostle Paul, who say: &quot;If you're really going &quot;first you have to be &quot;and that means you have &quot;and you have to keep certain So Paul has not got it right. Paul has to say, how radically new this thing is &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Paul preached of God's kingdom on earth, for those converted to Jesus. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): how it is now the moment Salvation is nearer to us now &gt;&gt; It's clear that that keeps showing up of Paul's ministry is, &quot;When is this kingdom &quot;What's going to happen? &quot;How soon?&quot; &gt;&gt; They are still, anticipating and the imminent arrival And it's this kind of, you know, &quot;Don't slow me down impatience and energy &gt;&gt; Paul's very first letter-- that we have in the New is I Thessalonians. And already in I Thessalonians, when people are starting to die and the kingdom hasn't &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Paul believed was about to change, and the end was at hand. &gt;&gt; Clearly, the message was the part to a Roman official, to any native population in Roman officialdom. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Paul attacked those to the coming Kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): When they say, then sudden destruction &gt;&gt; Scholars have wondered who &quot;peace and security.&quot; Some interpreters think that it's the first and they're no longer serious coming immediately. I tend to think, though, supportive of the imperial rule, of Augustan Paul is saying: &quot;of Augustus &quot;Divine wrath So, Paul is very clearly drawing between the rule of the emperor and the rule of God-- on the other hand. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Apocalyptic political turmoil Jewish resistance to Roman rule &gt;&gt; The situation in Jerusalem through the mid-60s also. Josephus tells us that there was over the last few governors He tells us that they were and corrupt administrators, for the, in order to Josephus also tells us that of growing tension because there's of bandit and rebel types in the country. And so between growing banditry, a politically active and then the corruption the situation very, very tense indeed. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In the year 60 after a decade building Paul decided that &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Now, with no in these regions, in a ministry to the saints. &gt;&gt; Paul wants to fulfill to Peter and James back For these ten years that he's had his congregations to take back to Jerusalem. Now we find him each congregation sending with their part and they're all going to lay it at the feet &gt;&gt; (dramatized): I know I will come in the fullness &gt;&gt; What seems to when he went back to Jerusalem he was arrested &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: According to Paul was taken to Rome before the emperor. Within a short span of time, Jesus movement were wiped out. &gt;&gt; The tradition holds in about the year 64. About the same time, the brother of Jesus, has also been killed, two- or three-year period. With the passing the expectation that all must be close at hand for a lot of people. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In the year 66 Jewish resistance broke out The rebels seized Jerusalem.

They were ready Everyone knew it. It was just a matter of when, fight to the death, So, on that fateful morning Josephus describes the events of them breaking the Roman soldiers running going into every house. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Pouring they massacred indiscriminately and burned the houses of all running everyone through They clogged the alleys and drowned The dead bodies of natives of priests and laity, and the blood of all manner in the courts of God. &gt;&gt; It's a pretty awful and we have lots between the artifacts of the first revolt that are of the archaeological record-- other kinds of indications hand-to-hand combat &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Toward evening, But as night fell, and the dawn broke in flames &gt;&gt; One of the most recent comes from the archaeology, &quot;the burnt house,&quot; the houses that apparently All of the furniture are here in place, and residue of the burning (flames crackling) &gt;&gt; (dramatized): The Romans All that was left that once supported of the nation of Israel. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Roman troops and carried off &gt;&gt; Jerusalem, the sacred city; the temple, the center of piety It's very important that up to and through Christians are still And the revolt and its aftermath of a split, its earlier traditions of the first revolt.
