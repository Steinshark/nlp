Hey guys, welcome to intellipaat and we are on V/S topic. If we talk about web development, we are all current industry and how widely it is being complex applications, working with Javascript And because it lacks some of the features need of having something more versatile with advanced features came into the picture. Javascript , has been a long talk about the same, that is Javascript vs So guys before we proceed forward, do subscribe never miss out on our any upcoming videos. agenda for this video. First and foremost, we will discuss Basics of Javascript and Typescript. After that how it came into existence then Why Typescript is in demand currently prototyping and data binding. if you are opting for either of them. to recap what all you have learned from this in the comment section below to know if you And if you are looking for courses in the Alright guys so now without any further delays, So guys, now let us get into the introductory and further well go into detail. What is JavaScript: of web technology. Its a scripting language web pages. dynamic pages and the programs that we write Scripts can be written in HTML(i.e. Notepad, file with .html or .js extension. The programs Scripts are executed as plaintext and you to run these programs. such as XML, REST, APIs etc. applications i.e. Its only applicable for few lines of code. What is TypeScript: and it is open source. and some additional features like static typing, Thats why people also refer this as modern a concept called Typing in this. Using and you must ensure that the type checking You can also say that Typescript is a superset features that you can put into Javascript writing a Javascript, its a valid Typescript, features and still itll be a valid Typescript. features, still itll be valid in Typescript. on the browsers, as it needs a compiler to In this, the source is saved with .ts Now, I will move further to discuss about up with the idea of TypeScript while having 2. Typescript development over Javascript In the very beginning when JavaScript was client side programming language. But, later used as a server side programming language. it started getting heavier and more complex. fulfill the requirement of object oriented how TypeScript came into the picture to bridge 3. Why Typescript and Javascript Why Javascript: tool for small application which has a few You can compile and run JavaScript in any JavaScript also allows cross-compilation. apps Why TypeScript: TypeScript is a superset of Javascript as TypeScript supports JS API Documentation and You can convert TypeScript Code into plain Typescript is optionally typed scripting language per the requirement if you want to add typing in TypeScript. technique and better code structure as compared If you are using Typescript, then itll the standard decorators. of using TypeScript over Javascript: 4. Pros: always highlights errors at compilation time you use JavaScript, errors gets pointed out You can run TypeScript on any browser or JavaScript TypeScript includes a feature that is strongly-typed helps us for checking the type correctness available in JavaScript.Typescript can be run on any browser or Javascript Engine. Typescript includes a feature that is strongly typed or support static typing. Static typing helps in checking the type correctness at compille time but this feature is noot available in javascript. Typescript also has a namespace concept by defining a module. it allows great tooling supports with IntelliSense added. is nothing but JavaScript and some additional Sometimes, It may not be supported in your compile the .ts files into ES3,ES4 and ES5 Frameworks like Angular2 also usage Typescript Cons: compile the code as compared to Javascript. If you run the TypeScript application in the TypeScript into JavaScript. 5. Features of Typescript and Javascript and Javascript one by one. I will not go in Ill try to make it short and to-the-point. Feature of Javascript: Javascript is easy to understand and to begin You can use Javascript for client side and Javascript is a dynamic language i.e. flexible If you are using Javascript, then you are It has strong Testing Workflow. Javascript is not supported in Framework. Feature of Typescript: run the source code on any browser, devices TypeScript is not specific to any Virtual-machine. JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript JavaScript code asTypeScript supports JS libraries whatever code you write in JavaScript gets extension from .js to .ts. JavaScript Code as Browsers can't understand in TypeScript then code gets compiled and by the help of JavaScript code, browsers can is known as Trans-piled. Now, let us take a quick look at some of the two: 7. Javascript vs Typescript 1. Compilation: In Typescript, error gets compile time. But as Javascript is an interpreted at runtime itself. code on the browser. But, Javascript code 3. Prototyping: Typescript consists a feature 4. Annotation: As TypeScript is a typed language, type of the variables, function parameters no Annotations is required for Javascript. classes, inheritance, interfaces, generics language. Typescript considers number and consider it as objects.Typescript also gives As we have quickly discussed about the parameters based on which we have made some differences Now let us move forward and discuss about parameters which has actually influences the differences in them. that is codes and syntaxes So now if you look at a screen out here there are two codes for multiplication in both javascript and typescript which actually influence the difference in them that is codes and synatxes So now if you look at a screen right here there are two codes for multiplication in both javascript and typescript. they look quite similar but in case of javascript you have to call the function in side the script only but in case of typescript you dont have to create the script so it might look a similar code over here but it when comes to longer implementation and longer application or i would say large application it actually becomes relevant when you dont add your objects or functions inside the script After knowing all the facts about them, you or recommended to use by the developers. 9. Which is better Typescript or Javascript? Well it depends, if you are an experienced which consists of relatively lesser lines JavaScript. But, if you have knowledge and which has complex and larger number of code, 10. Finally, on aspects of salary you can Job Vacancy and Salary: According to Indeed.com, full-time Job vacancy salary ranges from $80,000 to $ 1,20,000 per full-time Job vacancy for Typescript developer $90,000 to $1,25,000 per annum as per the of candidate. Javascript was developed in 1995 and ever since developers in it time and again. Hence the job occupancy Instagram, Airbnb and Codecademy and many Launched in November 2012, Typescript is an of the advanced oop features like modules, static typing and a lot more which are not reason why Frameworks like Angular 2 also In a nutshell, Id like to add that, due of industries have used it and still using it is a go to programming language when it on the other hand, typescript is a newcomer Right? But ever since it came into the picture, the scripting languages out there, due to Therefore, one can confidently say that demand as compared to Javascript. Companies like using Typescript. Industry usage for Typescript So, guys we are heading towards the end of Question based on Typescript and Javascript. comment section below. Quiz which option fits for features of Typescript? Option 1: Typescript can be compiled to all ES3, ES5, ES6 and Javascript ES7. which provides typed nature to your code browser development and is an open source Option 4: All of the above. Solution: Option 4
