You certainly look pleased. Mom, I'm back. Mom. You must be frozen! No. How about the Northeast? It was freezing! Chenxi, it's great to see you. Hi Xinyue! You've learned a lot from all those sermons, right? I've brought some good news back for everyone. - Good news? Come on, over here! - C'mon, c'mon. Oh, that girl. You're so excited, what is it? Yeah, tell us. What? Look! The Words of the Holy Spirit! The Holy Spirit has spoken! - The Holy Spirit has spoken! - Everyone have a seat. In 1991, we heard the Holy Spirit's words Everyone was overjoyed A chapter of the Holy Spirit's words came out God's words revealed many truths and gave us the path for Reading God's words every day felt so nourishing. We were all constantly immersed in a state of joy. However, six months later, the Communist Party's My parents and my brother were all arrested. Where'd these books come from? Where were they printed? No one's talking, huh? What about you? I don't know. You organize the gatherings, right? Tell me where those books came from. I don't know. Dad! - Don't hit him!

The police have been investigating Stay at Xinyue's place for the next few days, then come back when this has blown over. Be careful on your way there. What on earth? What are you doing? - Mom! Mom! - What is this? Stay still! Where'd you get these books? Tell us! Captain. Sit! Li Chenxi, you've got some guts for someone so young. You had some nerve Did you know that our government You people dare print religious materials Do you know what kind of crime that is? You're disseminating cult literature trying to overthrow our national government. You could get 10 to 20 years for that alone. Tell us what you know. Where did these books come from? Confess! If you don't confess, My faith is not a crime. I have nothing to confess. You're a hard nut to crack. You really drank the Kool-Aid, hm? Talk! You're just 17. We'd hate to see you given hard labor. As long as you tell us everything you know, we'll send you right back home. How about it? As believers, we try to be good people Why won't the government just let us be? Why do you persecute us? You silly little girl. What do you know? In China, anything the Communist Party Got it? You won't believe in the Party, spreading your gospel everywhere. More people believe in God We have to stop you, wipe you all out. That's the Party's policy, its law. Clear on that? Talk! Fess up! You'll be sorry if you don't! You, you, come with me. Move it! Come on! Get in there! Hurry up! Dad! Chenxi! Chenxi! Get back here. If you still don't want to talk, Dad! You stay here. This has nothing to do with my dad. Nothing to do with him? Tell us!

Tell us! Here, stop crying. Don't cry. The Communist Party is awful. This little girl just believes in God. She's done nothing wrong but they beat her dad right in front of her. How could they do that? It's so cruel! It's okay, don't cry. It's okay. It's okay. We know everything already. Look, someone already confessed Sort of pointless to be digging Once you've confessed everything, I'll call for a car to take you and your dad home. I give you my word. Whether your dad gets out or not depends on your cooperation. I'll ask you questions, and you just nod or shake your head. Did you go to Wangjia Village for a gathering? Did you go to the Northeast to listen to sermons? Who was preaching? Where were those books printed? I didn't know them. I don't know where the books were printed. Look, Mom! Mom, that's my classmate. Don't be silly! Isn't that Li Zhongdao's daughter? Such a good kid! Why's she there? The Party's arresting all the believers, She's just a teenager. What does she know? What could she really believe in at her age? Doesn't she have anything better to do than that? That's what she gets! God, please bind Satan, seal its mouth. Suspect Wu Deshun is under Li Chenxi is under criminal detention for breaking the law by illegally distributing cult literature Wang Youcai has been involved in repeated thefts leading to serious repercussions ... Write a letter of repentance. What's your problem? Write! Won't do it? You'll get at least three years of hard labor, and three more if you still believe after that. And three more if you keep believing! You are going to rot in prison! Write, or you'll see what's coming to you. Li Chenxi! Yes? Come on! Bedding from your parents. Hey, your family sent you bedding? What's wrong? It's so hot, but they sent me a big duvet. I must be going to a labor camp. Hey, don't overthink it. See if there's something in here. Go on, what are you looking at? Come here. Hey, see what it is. Here. There's more. I believe in the true God You talk pretty tough for a little girl. Let's see how you like the labor camp! Chenxi. Chenhui, where's Dad? He already got out. Our aunt used her connections Otherwise, you'd have to do hard labor. Let's go home. Being arrested and persecuted showed me how much and the truth in God's words. Only God has the truest love for people and God is our only rock in hard times. Starting in 1995 I went through sharing the kingdom gospel Thanks to the Lord! This is the Holy Spirit's voice. Many who read Almighty God's words recognized this is God's voice One by one, they accepted We can only be saved by accepting Almighty God's work for the last days. - Thanks be to God! We should accept God's work of the last days. Get out of here! Go! Get out of here! We will not accept your gospel. The Communist Party started to counter so-called illegal activities. Large scale arrests were carried out especially The Church of Almighty God. Where's your daughter? That year the police went to my home to arrest me, so I didn't dare go back home again. I felt timid and afraid in the face of We prayed and leaned on God and kept sharing the gospel and doing our duty, Is Li Zhongdao home? Li Zhongdao? Hello Li Zhongdao. Go to the county hospital. For what? To identify a body. A body? What body? - What happened? What's going on? Your daughter is dead. Mom! ... In 1998, I heard my mom's She was never the same again. I really wanted to go home and see her, I found myself near to home in 2004, Dad, Mom. Chenxi! Mom, it's me. Chenxi. Mom. You're back! Yes! Chenxi's back! Dad. Chenxi's back. Chenxi's back. It's wonderful that you're here. No one saw you come? No. Dad, how's your health? Just fine, don't worry. Chenxi. Chenhui. You're back. I thought ... Mom, what are you looking for? Sweetheart, have some candy. Mom, I'll get it myself. Come on, have some! Have some candy! - Mom. - Go ahead! I'll go fry an egg, it's your favorite. Mom, Mom, there's no need. It's late, we shouldn't wake the neighbors. I'll be quiet, I'll be quiet. - Mom, there's no need. Mom ... It's okay, just let her go. Chenxi loves fried eggs. My darling loves fried eggs. Dad, what's wrong with Mom? The Communist Party's kept a close eye Police and village cadres come often, Your mom was afraid you'd be arrested again and that they would take me and I'd be beaten to death like Brother Zhong. She was afraid all the time and would keep the main gate locked, terrified that the police would burst through. Then an officer came and told us He said you'd died. It was such a blow for her. She ended up like this. Our family's faith has been such a wonderful thing. I never imagined ... Alright. Let's talk about something else. Seeing you doing well is enough for me. Chenxi, will you stay for a few days? The police were just here asking about you. I came by to see everyone. I'll go before daybreak. Dad, I bought you and Mom some clothing. There's no need for that. Try it, see if it fits. Sweetie, don't go. Alright, I won't. Chenxi isn't leaving. Dad, I have to go. We're so busy with the church's gospel work and so many people don't know God has returned. I can't put my duty to spread the gospel aside That would be disloyal to God. Be careful out there. Pray and lean on God, be sure to be safe. The police are still looking for you. You should go. Don't worry, I'll take care of things at home. God, You know my weaknesses. Please enlighten and guide me, give me faith and strength so I can stand firm. Thank God! God's words are always here to sustain and help us. His words brighten our hearts and give us strength. Yes. - God's words are wonderful. I assumed the name Fang Jie in 2009, and I traveled through Sichuan, Anhui, That year the Communist Party launched another national operation against The cops are coming! Don't move! Hurry up! Stop! What are you doing? Don't move! Freeze! ... News of arrests of our brothers and sisters Brother Xiao Li and Sister Youling, I'd never seen so many arrests A dark, ominous feeling It seemed no place was safe. The atmosphere of terror was suffocating. That August they started where I was spreading the gospel. The Communist Party would dispatch large forces to seal off streets and apprehend Christians. Get up! Don't move! Everybody down! Why are you arresting us? You have to go! Sister Qi Hurry up! Hurry up or you won't get out of the city! It all happened so fast, There were arrests in Shandong and Jiangsu. Henan was a focus for Communist Party sweeps. I heard things were tense in Yunnan, I thought of the only place I could go. Routine check--show your ID. You. You, ID. You, ID. ID. God, please guide me. Where should I go now? Fang Jie? Sister Li! Come in. Brother Yang, Sister Feng, this is Sister Fang. She just fled to Fuyang and Alright, have a seat. Here, sit down. Just relax and stay here for a bit. Learning a song? Sister Feng, could you take this and ask her to send it to Xuzhou ASAP? Sure. Have you learned it yet? Just about. Let's sing it together. Alright. A few days ago, I heard from that Brother Xiao Li was given 15 years. 15 years? And four others were given 10 years or more. What law does our faith break? What about Sister Youling? What did she get? You haven't heard? Sister Youling was beaten to death by the police. Beaten to death? Five days after her arrest, Her husband saw bruises all over her body, They insisted she'd died suddenly of a heart attack and that those bruises had appeared after she died. Why hasn't Mom gotten back - Mom. Someone was following me just now. Did you lose them? I did. It's not safe here anymore. We have to move right away. We can hide at my sister's old place for now. - Alright. Hurry, let's get our stuff together. Take a break. We've moved so many times this year. There's a lesson in it. Followers of God have to endure suffering. I'm constantly on edge. My heart skips a beat whenever afraid the police are going to burst in. The police are chasing me in my dreams. The CCP started another round of mass arrests against The Church of Almighty God in 2012. Days before it launched, I was just as cautious as always but I didn't know that danger was Daddy! Hello? Don't move! - Come on! What are you doing? Squat there! I'll ask you again. Are you Fang Jie? Are you a church leader? You think we don't know anything? We confiscated all those books you printed. You are the one in charge! Get up! Up! Now! Tell us. Where's the church's money? Who's your leader? Will you talk? Will you talk? Will you talk? Will you talk? Will you talk? Will you talk? Will you talk? ... Then tell me first, what's your name? What's your full name? Why would you ask me that? You're interrogating me. Don't I have the right to know your name? Dammit. Get up. Shit, she's tough. Up! Squat! A number of officers tried, They transferred me to Nanjing Are you Fang Jie? Are you a church leader? Tell me! You think you can hold out on us Don't press your luck! The Central Committee has ordered us to make a clean sweep and totally eliminate The Church of Almighty God. Being so loyal to your faith will not only get you prison, it could cost you your life. Is it worth it? Think about it. In China, following the Party Believing in God is simply not an option. After my arrest, the police wouldn't You feeling sleepy? No sleeping! I was totally exhausted after It felt like there was a heavy weight and I was struggling to breathe. I'll give you 30 more minutes. If you don't talk, the next round won't be this nice. It's 2:30 now. You have until 3:00. It's been 10 minutes. Have you thought it over? She talked? 20 minutes. 5 minutes left. You'd better think about this. Don't say I didn't warn you. God, I don't know what else Please protect me so I can How about it? Have you made up your mind? I haven't done anything illegal. I have nothing to confess. Dammit, you're a piece of work! Do you have a family history of disease? She has a serious heart condition. It's fine. She'll just be here a week, Get in there. Strip for a search. Take your clothes off! Hurry up! Off! C'mon! Take it all off. Do it! All of it! Did you hear? Do I have to help you? Now! Arms out. Legs apart. Turn around. Turn around! Legs apart. Arms out. - Out! Put them out. Turn around. Legs apart. Higher! Get in there. Go on! Take &quot;good care&quot; of her. What did you do? How'd you end up here? Believing in God. Believing in God? Where is He, anyway? Yeah! Where is He? Take your clothes off. Why? For a search. They just did that. We need to do another one. That's the rule. Take it off. Come on! What's the hold-up? Hurry up! Come on, stop dragging your feet. Would you hurry it up? Take everything off! You got yourself here-- Come on! Spread your legs and do a wide squat. Down! I'm on my period. Don't waste your breath. Do it! Squat! Now! Get up! Squat! Up! Squat! Up! Squat! Up! Squat! The Communist Party is truly evil. They're lower than beasts and deserve damnation. Could you give me a little toilet paper? I told you, no one can help her! You hear me? Get up. It's your shift, come on! Starting my first day in the detention house, I had to take a two of walking back and forth without stopping, Hey, away from the wall. Otherwise, I'd be punished I learned what it's like to have every day Sun Jing, hurry it up! You're taking ages to brush your teeth. Stop dragging your feet. Food's coming soon, hurry up there! Li Chenxi, come here. Go clean the bathroom. Now! What kind of scrubbing is that? Get your arm in there! Get it clean. Down. Farther down. You can eat. Toilet, please. Me too, please. Anyone else need to go? I do. Go ahead. Stop! How are you supposed to get down? Time's up. Go next time. Get back up there! What are you looking at? Don't you get it? She said go back! Stop! Your slippers. Straighten them. There wasn't any freedom or dignity there. There were rules for sitting, Bathroom, please. Hold it. Even using the bathroom, the most basic Sun Jing peed her pants! Eww, that's embarrassing! Sun Jing, what the hell is wrong with you? Clean it up, fast! Who told you to piss on the platform? Clean it up! Are you stupid? There's something wrong with you. Stop your crying, move it! Some prisoners ended up losing their minds, unable to withstand the Are you really crazy, or just pretending? You're faking it, right? Is it real? Here you go. Eat. Have some more. The Communist Party prison was hell on earth. Li Chenxi. She's using the bathroom. You're called for questioning! Li Chenxi, we know everything about your family. Are you Fang Jie? You won't say anything because of being a Judas, right? We've already told your church friends They won't want you back when you get out. You're screwed either way. Yours is a special case. We can keep you locked up indefinitely, however long we want. Go think it over. My first three months in the detention house, sometimes from morning until night. Speak now! I was under incredible stress Sometimes I'd feel panic and On top of questioning, they made me watch videos and talk about what I'd learned. That was also a kind of torture for me. Share what you've gained I have nothing to say. You have to! I just hope that the Communist Party allows freedom of belief, You really have a mouth on you. Make a note of that! Next. Once winter started, each day and my prison days became even harder. The water's too cold. Quit lollygagging, hurry up! It's freezing! The Party is so damn evil. Washing with freezing water They're experts at torturing people. The Party's been awful from the very start. All its words are sweet, all its deeds are evil. You, hurry up! Get out of here when you're done, don't waste time! Get up, get up, get up. Hurry up. It's so damp. Look, I can wring water out of it. This place isn't fit for humans. My health continued to deteriorate My rheumatism and heart condition grew worse. I was weak and in pain But when it did come time to sleep, I was afraid because that was like being punished, too. It was so crowded I couldn't even move. Get up, it's your shift. Hurry up. The cold, the sleep deprivation, and the pain made every step torture. It was as if time stopped. Every single second was a struggle. I constantly prayed, sang hymns in praise of God, What's wrong? Are you okay? Hey, wake up. Li Chenxi's heart is acting up again. Li Chenxi's heart is acting up again. Should I report it to the guard? The guard won't do anything. Just do your shift. Am I going to die here? God, my life is in Your hands. Even if I don't make it, I still If I am called to give my life I'll have no regrets. It's all been worth it. Li Chenxi, I've never seen anyone It's been more than three months You've practically got me on my knees. You could, you could even make something up so we can tell our superiors we got something! You ... I don't understand. The government has cracked down so hard Why are you people so driven? You give up everything, You go on the run, you can't go home, What's it all for? You're atheists who don't believe there's a God. What would you know about faith? You just care about money, fame, and status, but do those things really bring you peace? I think people with those things suffer more. You just obsess over promotions, There's no telling when you'll be imprisoned, lose your life, or lose your standing. We all get what we deserve in the end. This is a dark and evil world. Disasters are growing fiercer. Anyone without faith, without repentance, will be punished, swept away Almighty God expresses the truth to save us from the disasters This is a wonderful thing! We share the gospel and give testimony so more people will accept gain His salvation, and What's wrong with that? Why are you always persecuting us? Aren't you supposed to serve the people? Why can't you leave people of faith be? Li Chenxi, that's enough out of you! You dare preach to us. You're an intractable &quot;godized element&quot;! Li Chenxi, your parents are so old, and they took care of you all those years. You're not at home taking care of them, Aren't you letting them down? Have you realized that if you're sentenced to 10 or 20 years? You really want them to grow old alone? Isn't that selfish of you? Just tell us about your church We'll help you find a job What do you think? When I was 13, I was arrested for attending a gathering. The police locked me in a small, I don't know how I would have gotten When I was 17, my whole family was arrested The police interrogated and tortured them nonstop and my dad was nearly blinded They even beat him right in front of me, trying to get me to tell them about the church. I was paraded through the streets, If it weren't for the strength God gave me, how could I have withstood such humiliation and pain as a young teenage girl? My dad's health deteriorated and things got harder at home. We struggled to make a living. The police kept monitoring and trying to arrest me, forcing me to go on the run. My whole family lived in fear and our lives were destroyed. When I was 23, the local police lied, and asked them to identify my body at the morgue. My mom couldn't take it and had a mental breakdown. Since then, she's been a completely different person. Confused one moment, alert the next. All household responsibilities As their daughter, all that I'm able to do for them I can't do a thing for them. The local government and police even on the holidays. All just to get to me. Home? I lost that ages ago. I haven't been able to go back for years. If it weren't for God giving me guidance, if it weren't for the brothers I would have been ... For me, going home is an impossibility. I long to see my parents in my dreams. That would be enough for me. We didn't do any of these things. That was all your local police. We had nothing to do with that. We really feel for what you've suffered, but this is the Party policy. Our hands are tied. Do you want redress, I know that believers in Almighty God and we don't have anything against you personally. If you have to hate something, hate the Party. Over four months passed. Since the police didn't find and I had a serious heart condition, they released me on bail pending trial and had the local public security and Li Chenxi, call me the moment you arrive. Did you hear me? Your case is still open. As soon as we confirm we'll bring you back in. Run to the ends of the earth Get going. Come on. The police are bad! The police are bad! They're not good people! Get out! Get out! The police are bad! Get out! The police are bad! Get out! Get out! Li Chenxi, don't think it's all over You're a primary target for monitoring in our city. You need to report to the police station You're absolutely forbidden to practice your faith, You can't have contact I don't have any freedom at all? You want freedom? We have to keep a close eye on you I'll be coming by to check up on you. If we find out that you're practicing your faith you'll get at least eight years. Got it? Take her photo. What's that for? To locate her wherever she goes. Help the government and keep an eye on her. Okay. Report her right away Alright. Watch her. Going out? Where are you headed? Going out again? Almighty God, You know what I'm facing. I can't go to gatherings or share the gospel. God, please show me a way out. Some Christians in Baiyun District and want to read Almighty God's words. We should send a couple of people over. I heard some brothers and sisters but the pastor reported them to the police. We have to tread carefully and You're right. Brother Wang and Sister Zhou When I was sharing the gospel in Guangdong in 2013, there was another round The evening of September 25 alone, In 2014, the Communist Party launched a national campaign the &quot;Hundred Days Battle.&quot; Huge numbers of public security officers, were dispatched to arrest Christians. So many brothers and sisters were taken. Some were sentenced, some were beaten to death, and some had their organs removed. Fess up! Don't stop! Confess! In China, a sense of fear permeates everything. The shadow of the Communist Party's reign looms over all of China. Let's go. Oh God, please protect me so I can be strong and brave through this nightmare and follow You until the very end.
