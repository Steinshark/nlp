Are you hungry? Dawdling? Get back and go to work! What's wrong with you? Aren't you a man? Why can't you do the work by yourself? Stop hitting others. It's none of your business. Get lost! It's my slave. I can order him to do whatever I want to. Does this have anything to do with you? Even a slave is not born to be hit. Seriously? You're more like a slave in my eyes. Do you even deserve one? Are you kidding me? Why would I? Now that you said he's your slave, can you tell me which big family are you from I know well enough about the families inside Luo Yang City. Or if he's bought by you, where's your certification? What's wrong with you? Why would I give it to you? Stop saying nonsense if you can't show it. Is he from black market? Let him show the certification, shall we? Right! Show us the certification! Stop shouting! They're fighting! They're fighting! There is a fight! Move! My horse! Move! Move way! Sir! Chase him! Miss! New snaffle! The old one is broken. Stop yelling. Make way. Move! He's lost again. Never mind, back to the office. Quickly. Hold it tightly Hold it tightly. Quickly. Though he looks dirty, he is of great strength. Buy him and let him do everything you want. In the worst case, you can let him guard your house and garden. That is not a human, but a monster. Of course, he's a human. Who are you? But I think it's a monster. But that's OK if you want to treat him like a dog. This guy is unusual. He can carry heavy things that three men can do. You must take good care of your goods. Otherwise how could you sell them out? I buy it. OK. Give me the money. Delivery against payment. You're vigorous in action. How can you control it? Behave yourself. She is sprinkling drug powder. You saved my life at the market the other day, didn't you? Let go of him. Take the chain. You can't catch him once loosening the chain. I said, let go of him. All right. He's running away. I bought you just now. I'm your master. Come back! He runs away! I... Shopkeeper. Your identities are as much as your masks. Who are you? We got into trouble. Run! Mr. Ye, are you alright? Leave me alone, catch him. Surround them. Yes. How dare you! Come and go as you wish! Are you treating my shop as the city gate! You dare to stir up troubles at here! I will break your legs. Who want to die first? Come on! Beat them. That slave trafficker was right. The slave is so great. Amazing. Miss, it was him who brought you back last night. - Fetch the mutton for me. It's just fetched from the kitchen. They're delicious. I just stay here and watch you. I won't go there. Just go ahead. Is it delicious? I didn't cheat you, right? It's still hot! If you think it's delicious, then I'll get it for you everyday. It's me who bought you back, not to mention giving foods for repaying you back, right? So it's also my responsibility. But you still need to know that I'll be your master You ungrateful bastard! Run away? Get down! Can't I conquer you? Come here! What's going on? That's the shadow in Ru Yue's room! Don't move! You're bathing now! Hold it! It's bathing! How dirty you are! Come on! Sit down! Tell me. Who do you think is handsome? He or Shi Tou? How could you say that he's a... shadow... what shadow? Come on. Let me tell you. It'll be alright for you to stay with Shi Tou. He could even do things for you at the risk of his life! And what about him? Actually he's just as unlucky as you. He did the most tiring thing in Qianduan Brothel. And sometimes he had to be whipped. Maybe he was seen by you while escaping. What Miss said is right. Let me prepare some food for you! Come with me! Miss. Where did you find the boy? It really uses a lot of water to wash him clean. Well, don't mention it. If I hadn't met him, you might not see me here. Eat at the table. All the foods on the table are yours. It's unworthy to eat only a thigh here! What's your name? Why are you looking at me in this way? Anyhow I bought you back. Tell me! What's your name? How old are you? Your home? Your parents? Where are you from? Miss. I think maybe he's 18 or 19 according to his figure. But he knows nothing. Just let a man stay in the Mansion... If the Master and Madam ask about it, well... You can just tell him that Don't worry. I'll be responsible for it. Have your nice meal first. He slacks off here in the morning. He was helping me feed the horses. Give him a name first. You sleep on the wood everyday, and you are so happy doing this. Let me call you Mu Le (Wood Happy). Such a good name! Mu Le. Mu Le. Le. Smile to me. Call me Miss. Mu Le, call her Miss. This is the rule here. It's your honor to be the domestic servant here. Don't be unhappy, you have to obey the rule. He got stung by this. Give it to me. Don't flaunt your superiority, Miss. Where are you going? Miss, Miss, The young master did business and lost plenty of money, he wanted to pay for the debts with antique jade bottle, but the debtee doesn't see it's worthy, He even kidnapped the young master and asked me to report. Miss, I beg you to save the young master's life. He would die if you are late. We have lost some valuable paintings and porcelains once he became the horse boy in the Mansion. Where is he? Luotian Cave of Jinyun Mountain. Miss, Miss. Sister! Are you, are you here to save me? Don't panic. Here is the treasure. Leave my brother free. How moving the scene is, But what a pity, Now, it's midnight, the Ghost Market have opened. We are businessman, we have our rules. Pardon me, Miss Ye. It's because that you're a businessman, Leave my brother free. Mu Le! How dare you to fight me with your feeble Kung Fu. You're a businessman. Don't be so harsh on us. We have taken the treasure here Both sides will lose if you go too far. You're right, Miss Ye. As the old saying, It's a lesson for you. The Ghost Market is opening, here is a deal, if you are lucky enough to sell it here and now, you may leave; if you are not, and can't sell it, then don't you blame me. Deal. Okay. Show it out, quickly! Don't keep us guessing! The girl is new here, so I wonder what treasure she brought in. We can't buy it, if you don't say anything. - Right? Miss Ye, show us the treasure. This is the treasured sword that the Emperor Gaozu granted to my grand grandfather for he did a great job protecting him. It is the real one. If it were not for my brother's life, I will never take it out for sale. I hope the treasured sword will get by a good master here. The Emperor Gaozu didn't grant many treasures, if it's real, then it will worth a whole city. Miss, it's a good advertisement. But in Luotian Cave, the advertising is not working. Only by showing it, we can tell whether it's that worthy. Right? Show us! Let's have a look! Now you can see the treasured sword from the Emperor Gaozu. Show us! Show us! What' re you waiting for? Are you kidding? Get off the stage! My sword! How come? [Here you are.] [It must be the masked woman who...] How dare you play tricks here in Luotian Cave? Guards! Take her! - Yes! I... Let go of me! Keep walking. That is all? Where's the performance? You said there would be a performance! Where is it? Everyone, calm down. For the grand finale, we must wait for a grand figure. Let me present you Head Constable of Luoyang county, Zhao Lanzhi, Zhao Sir. I've heard of him. He's solved many big cases, a hard character. Yeah, just not long before, I heard that he solved the Qianduan Brothel Case. So he did! Zhao Sir here, is a big hero out and out. Today I'm having him to give you a performance. Now, bring them onto stage. Hurry! Move! Hurry! Zhao Sir, this is your sword. What are you doing? Those three people are grave robbers who act against the law and commit various crimes. Zhao Sir, you're a man of integrity who resents the evil, thus I hope you can uphold the justice for the folks by killing them. I don't think it is against your principle. Plus, do it quickly, have them beheaded, the royal painting will be returned to you, here and now. I promise. So it is you. What' re you doing here? I came to my brother's rescue, but got trapped by them. Sir, you've had your chance and missed it. Everyone, don't be disappointed. Since Zhao Sir refuses to perform for us, we'll make him a tool for our performance. It's almost dawn, so how about me performing drowning people in the pool for you? Okay! Good! Sister, I thought you were here to get me out. How come that we're gonna die here together? Had you not owed money here, I'd never be trapped like this! It's the painting that I'm after. There's no need harming others. Mr. Xue, there's something you don't know. Zhao Sir over there is also looking for it. There' re only two options if targeted by him, either kill him, or killed by him. I don't want to kill Boren, but he dies because of me. Well, where's the painting? Here it is. The beloved Painting of Basjoo Tree of the Empress. But how do you know it? Is there any history between you and her? You did get me the painting, but I still can't give you the Divine Bead. What do you mean? Put it back, back to the Empress. Or? Or you will never have the Divine Bead. What if I must have it now? Infanta Minghui, do you know where it is without information from me? You think this is fun? They say never relax vigilance against evildoers. I've early known your plan, so there's nothing you can do to corner me. Wait! I'm on it. Prepare the Divine Bead. Take my word, you shall pay for it. So arrogant and ignorant! Try to break from the refined iron cage barehanded? Come on! Zhao Lanzhi! Lower it now! Hurry! What' s happening? Who's this? Infanta, they' re gone. Go and get Zhao Lanzhi out! I want him alive! Sorry but I can't do it. Hurry back. I'll go to save Zhao. No, you'll have yourself killed. Now we finally made it out, I say we just play safe and go home. He saved us back there! How can we leave him behind? So I'm left alone again! Wait for me! Wake up! - Young Master. Young Master, what happened? - Young Master! Slow down, young Master. Is everything OK, young Master? Please talk to us. Young Master. What happened? Is everything Okay? - Miss! - Who did it to you? She passed out. Miss! - Come and help! Yes, Madam. - Easy, young Master. Xia, what' re you doing here? Go and find the doctor! Master! Master! Hurry! Please hurry! What happened to you two? Help her! You seem in a worse state than her. I'm fine. Please help her! Take it. Move away. It has been a long time. Why is she still unconscious? It's easy to wake her. Come and drink the wine, and I'll wake her up. Get out of the way. Now she's awake. Zhao Lanzhi! Zhao Lanzhi! Zhao Lanzhi. You're home now. Your horse boy carried you back. Your wound is not serious, all you need is a little rest. Where' re you going? Back to Luotian Cave to help Zhao Lanzhi. You were lucky to come back alive. Now you want to go back? Are you out of your mind? In order to help me, Zhao Lanzhi got himself sunk into the cold and deep pool. No matter what, I'll get him out of there. You said it yourself that it's a deep pool, so he might be dead already. Even though there's just a bone left, I would get the bone back! I won't let him die for nothing. I'll revenge him. Move! Revenge him? Look at yourself. How do you revenge him? All bark and no bite. You must have some ideas, right? Now you want my help? You seemed to enjoy tricking me the other day. I can help you. Only if... if you kneel down and beg me. Get away! You are also with her! Fine, fine. Get up. We've known each other for a long time. You can't even tell that I was joking? Get up! Now tell me about them. Who are those people that did this to you? And where are they now? So it's a cave in a mountain. It can't be simpler. Had you told me earlier, you wouldn't end up like this. What's your plan? Idiot! The fire! It's a cave, so you just need to block the entrance and exit. Then set a big fire, a really big fire. And if you want to kill them, wait at the exit, then kill those who flee there. If you don't, you can still watch them jumping into the pool. That must be a huge scene. You're a genius. Um...as for the kerosene and sulfur, I have much here. I'll get them ready for you now. Why did you stop me? I didn't want to see you risk your life. Then why did you change your mind and kneel down with me? I'll go with you if you must go back. I'll follow your order. Okay then. Follow my order and don't go with me. Just stay at home. No. You were wounded. It doesn't hurt. This... Shushu. Coming coming. Here, here. Take them. Three bags for each. Explosives and kerosene. Spread them wherever you go. Go and spread, do remember. There' re two masks over there. Do put on them when you set the fire. One for one, one... Since when do you have such amazing medicines? You got me. You're healed already? All healed. Brat, you're amazing. Stay and let me do some research on you. - Stay! Let's go! This... Let...let me have a look before you go! So fast? Wait! There's one more. With this, no cliff can ever stop you. Take it. I'll buy you chicken legs when we're back. When you're back alive. Bite your tongue. Let's go. Stop now! Yuan' an, where' re you heading to? With this slave! Yuanning is bruised all over, and crying. Be honest with me, did you bully him again? After all, he' s your little brother. Why can't you be kind to him? Are you listening? I've nothing to do with Yuanning' s wounds. You've always been teaching me that we should be grateful. Now a man has save my life at the cost of his own, Shouldn't I find his body and revenge him? He died? I'll explain later. Let's go. Go! Hurry! Stop! You! Stop! Congratulations! Are you done? Now my turn! What's happening? Go and check it! Go go go! Hurry! Let's get out of here! Go! Yuan' an! You're alive! What're you doing with her? She stole my sword and almost sent me to the hell. It was she who saved me from the monster fish pool. I assure you, she's not a good person! [It's impossible!] [How did he get so strong?] We can't stay here any longer. It's been spilled with kerosene and sulfur. Let's leave. Come. Hurry! Take it. Follow us. Come on. Give me the painting. It belongs to the Empress. So I will see to it that it returns to her. Zhao Lanzhi! Do remember that you owe me one! Zhao Lanzhi! You're all well. It happened so quickly. I also thought that I can't make it then. But that veiled maiden saved me. Don't you mention her to me! It was her who stole my stuff. And got me killed. Where's she? She's gone. Trust me, she's gone because of guilt. She must be hiding something. Leave her alone. By the way, you've already made it out, why did you coming back? Of course for you! Well. Let me tell you like this. You're the servant. While she's the master. You're so different. You're just wasting your time if you like her. All you do will be in vain. You must know clearly who you are. Mu Le, clear that? Why are you here? Zhao. Excuse me. See you. Mu Le, in the fight to clear out the evil monk, you helped me. I do appreciate it. Forget what happened before. Let's celebrate today. Let's go get a drink. You two are here. Today is worthy to be celebrated. No matter what happened before, after drinking together, it'll disappear. Mr. Zhao is proposing a toast to you. You shall be thankful. I don't deserve it. He's so stubborn. Don't blame him. After a catastrophe, everyone almost lost their lives. Yes. Luckily the empress managed it so well. Did you really kneel for three days there? If you were there, would you do the same for me? Of course. That's it. What I do is just so simple. You once said we should do the right thing for the right person. Thank you. Nothing. Yuan'an, Could you please answer my question directly and clearly? Go ahead. Am I... the person you care most? Why do you ask this? The person you care most is Mu Le, right? Am I right? Don't guess without ground. Anyway, Mu Le used to work in Ye mansion. He saved me for several times. So I should be nice to him. Just because he's not in the same position as you, so I should be cold to him. That's not right. Well, listen. How about me? What do you think of me in your heart? Yuan'an, You're... You're... Relax. I'm just asking randomly. You know, you're impartial. You do everything according to the rules. Yuan'an. That's how I think of you. It's getting late. Shall I walk you home? Okay. Wait, when we were having dinner, I didn't finish my words. Empress said, she awarded us many things. I don't need that much. Then those belongs to you, I'll take them out and give it to you. You're giving me money? I don't care about money. What do you care about? What do I care about? I care about you. Are you crazy? Why can't I? He can even do that. What are you saying? Zhao Lanzhi! What did you talk to him? Why did he hold your hands like this? It's none of your business. Must I report to you what he said to me? Yes. I'm just nobody. Just because you took Tianshu back and saved my life doesn't mean you can do everything to me. Let me ask you, I begged you to do what you've done now? No. Since I didn't beg, it's you who want to do this, right? Yes. I want to do that. Since you want to do that, I didn't own you anything. Right? Yes. Okay. Since I didn't own you anything. Remember, I treat you well, just because you work in my family. And because you're nice to me. But that doesn't mean that you could do everything to me. It's you. Why are you here? I've waiting for you since our separation at Huodu Hill. Thank you for saving my life last time. Is there anything I can do for you? Yes. And it's important. What is it? I'd like to take you back to your hometown, the kingdom of Suoluo. You know about Suoluo? Have you ever heard of a word, &quot;Huole De Tuotuo&quot;? I know it! But how did you know it! What on earth does it mean? I'll tell you about it later. I'd like to talk about the things that have happened to you and you can see if I say it right. You forget who you are and strange things happened to you. Things that are really strange. For example, you have great strength than the average people; and you run specially fast. Without any training, in a fight and make progress in no time. Another example, your wounds can recover themselves. [Are you kidding me?] [Where's the wound?] What else do you know? One more thing, you often see another you, but that &quot;you&quot; isn't a slave, instead, he is seasoned in battle; he's an invincible warrior. Because of this, you can defeat all the soldiers when you were at Huodu Hill. You are not a common man! You were born a king with granted super power. Who are you? How did you know so much about me? I'm... a king? Yes... What are you doing! You're Prince Ying of Suoluo! And I'm Zhenzhen, your servant! Tell me! What happened? You came to the State of Tang on a mission and went through a lot, but now you forget who you are. You were injured by a huge rock at Huodu Hill and almost lost your life. I brought you back to life with a pill. However, that wasn't the end of your suffering... Now, you're heart-broken for a woman. If you take this pill, you'll recover your memories, the memories that belong to Prince Ying, Are you saying, I can get back my memories by taking this pill? Hold on! The pill can recover your memories, but it can also deprive you of your memories about what you've experienced in Tang, including the woman who broke your heart. [Stay here, Zhao Lanzhi!] [You can't leave me!] [Get out!] [She's never regarded you as a servant. ] [Perhaps in her heart,] [you are important than me. ] [Help me to look after her. ] [Yuan'an, ] [what's done is done.] [It's no use denying the fact that we can't get married. ] [Do you really want to ruin my wedding?] [You said that you like me,] [but in fact, your real love is ] [Zhao Lanzhi. ] [Have some.] [Yuan'an.] [I understand.] [You said that you liked me.] [But actually you love Zhao Lanzhi.] I didn't expect you have the courage to come here. I thought you had already escaped after such a big accident. Do you think you can get rid of this by saying nothing? Do you think he can come to you? You are such a stupid... Stupid girl, right? Yes. I was cheated to drink the poisonous wine and did what you made me to do. I took Mu Le in but was betrayed by him. I am stupid, really. Are you happy watching me being silly? You can be silly, but never get others into trouble. Ye Yuan'an, we are looking for him together. Why do you sit here and do nothing? Go, come with me. I am tired now, I need rest. Get up, stand up. I won't go! If you want to do that then go, get out! It's been four days. You are not afraid of death. But have you ever thought of others? It just leaves a big scar if you get beheaded. I don't want to go, what can you do with me? Are you insane? You dare to hit me? I am hitting you! I am waking you up, a selfish woman! Ye Yuan'an, do you know why I hate you so deep? Because you are a trouble maker who need others to help you out. Don't look at me like that. I am telling the truth. You hate him now, don't you? You hate him cheating on you, but you are angrier that you cannot do anything. Do you think it can get well if you sleep? No, everything would get worse. All the people will die for it. Do you want this? If I were you, Ye Yuan'an, I would find him by hook or by crook. I would make him regret cheating me. I just got married. I will live with Zhao Lanzhi for the rest of my life. I think I have a lot of happy days later. I don't want to be killed by the Empress. So please think what he did and what he said that could help us. Why are you here? I know how we can find Mu Le. Follow me. Welcome Prince Heng back. My sovereign king, You were such a healthy and brave man before. Please open your eyes again, and look at your wife and courtiers. Please, don't leave us so quickly. Please wait for your boy Prince Ying. Prince Ying is here! - Prince Ying! - Mother. Be quick. Father. Father! Prince Ying brings the beads back for you. Father, can you hear me? Master Fale, you must cure king with the beads. Please, Nine Divine Beads. Blessing my king and Suoluo. Blessing my king and Suoluo. Blessing my king and Suoluo. All trash! Why? It's just a little star. Why is it shining like moon? Is Prince Ying back? Prince Ying, it's been hard for you these days. Since you leave for Tang, I haven't received any of your messages. I thought you would never be back. Sorry for making you worry about me. It's my fault. Stand up, stand up. It's good for you to come back. I not only get back safely, but take the beads back as well. You saved your father's life, and also the whole Suoluo. You didn't let me down. What's wrong? Who dares to hurt you? Mother, I've forgotten all the things and people in Tang. The way to Suoluo is dangerous, you have to be careful. Thanks, Sir. Why are you here? Don't misunderstand. I never want to see you. I am just here to remind you that many people's lives are on you. You have to get the beads back alive. Cut the crap. Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Why are you here? Look at you. You are leaving for so long this time. We are such good friends, I have to see you off. But why do you dress like this? I'm ugly if I cry. I don't want scare you. Don't act so nice. If you kept the beads well, do I have to do this today? Why are you saying this? Let bygones be bygones. I am coming to remind you of something. Go ahead. Suoluo is different from Tang. Not only the weather is hot and full of noxious insects, Most people there can do witchcraft. Be careful on your way! Don't do anything rashly. Don't worry, I've taken the treasures you gave me. I put them in my bag for unexpected needs. You are quite smart. Besides, I have three tips for you. The three tips are about sky, earth and people. Here. The first two tips about sky and earth can be opened when you are trapped and have nothing to do with it. The last one about people can be opened after you get Nine Divine Beads. Act as we have planed, understand? It's so mysterious. Why don't I open them now? You...why can't you keep calm now? The tips will save your life when something dangerous happens. Do you want them or not? Give them back to me, I'll burn them. I know, I know. I'll keep them. Don't worry. I won't open them until the most dangerous time. Anything else? When I had dinner just now, I thought that you were leaving today, so I bring this to you. Here. If you don't feel comfortable on your way, this may save your life. Thanks, but it's bit by you. I accept your kindness. Don't be worry, I can take care of myself. Bye. It...It works. Take care of my parents and brother. This is the capital of our Suoluo Kingdom. The building there, surrounded by grapefruit and linden trees, is the Suoluo palace. How can we get pass the tight security? My Miss, do you forget that you're with me? As long as I'm here, you'll get into the palace without any effort. Then you'll see Prince Ying, who you miss so much. It is his life that I desire so much to take. Fine, you desire so much to kill him. Satisfied now? [Mu Le, can you believe it?] [I really tracked you down here.] [Why do I always feel a pain here?] [How did I get the wound?] Prince. Arise. I told you before, I can dress and undress perfectly by myself. Just leave. I can take care of it. It's our job to wait on you. If we leave you to dress yourself, then we'll be responsible for dereliction of duty. Behave yourselves! Mother. What on earth are you doing to Prince Ying? Your Highness, we're just helping the Prince get dressed and combed. Then you must have failed doing it properly. Leave now. Yes. It's surprising that the hero of our Suoluo Kingdom, who traced back the Kingdom's treasure, doesn't even know how to give orders to servants. It will give people a good laugh. Please excuse me. I'm just not comfortable with it. Then are you comfortable with me combing hair for you? Boy, you've gone for a long time. So many things and rules here have faded out of your memory. You see, on the street, there' re blacksmiths, butchers The same diversity exists in our palace, too. You are the master, who are destined to be waited on. That means you can have a lot done by others. For those servants, it's their job to serve you. If you're uncomfortable with it, then how could they make a living? Do you understand? Yes mother, I understand. Mother, I'd like to go for a horseback archery to practice my skills. Of course. Guards. Greetings. Queen and Prince. Go and get my horse ready. Yes. Zhenzhen. Your Highness. Those servants didn't know what they were doing. I want them all to get changed. Tell the man in charge to find Prince Ying some clever maidens. Yes. Ying has changed a lot since he came back. I wonder what had happened to him in the Kingdom of Tang that made him less and less like a prince. Your Highness, after we left Suoluo Kingdom, I was separated from Prince Ying for a while. And when we were united, I knew but little about his experience. What little do you know? I... All I know is that he was bought into an official' s mansion to be a servant, a horse boy. What? A horse boy? Whoever that was his master must have risked a lot. So about the favor I asked... Rest assured. She's the girl? You came to the right man. I won't let you down. See you. Take care. We've had a deal. Everything will go smoothly. Impressive. You've found a way in such a short time. The man who just left is an eunuch in the palace. He is in charge of recruiting new maidens and eunuchs. He owed me a big favor in the past. So whatever I ask of him, he'll help me. You're lucky that the palace is recruiting maidens now. We have decided that you will go as the daughter of Shiwag, Miss Nana, as soon as possible. Clear? Yes. From now on, you're no longer Miss Yuan' an of the Kingdom of Tang. You're now Shiwag Nana. Won't we be caught? Of course not. Mr. Shiwag doesn't want his daughter to be a palace maiden. So it's a win-win situation. Don't worry about it. Okay, I see! Thank you. With all due respect, I still have one concern. What is it? Miss Yuan' an, you're a miss who is used to being waited on back in Kingdom of Tang. Can you really become a serving maiden in the Suoluo palace? What's more, maidens in the palace are different from those ordinary servants. Apart from being well-trained and well-behaved, they also possess some unique talents. Are you sure you are qualified? If your manners give you away, you will be thrown out before meeting Prince Ying. Then all our efforts will go to waste. Fair point. So...now what? Can you help train me? I'm afraid there's no time for cram training. Okay, stop here. General manager, they are the newly recruited maidens. According to the royal request, they all come from good families with clean backgrounds. Besides, they are quite gorgeous. That's for sure. But since it's the royal family who they will be serving, they also have to be simple, kind, and with excellent skills. Of course, of course. I'll leave them to your examination. As for the appearance, quite pretty. Follow the tradition, and take them to embroidery workshop. Yes. Could you please help me with it? Thank you. Who...who took my embroidery? This is not mine. General manager, I didn't make this. I don't know why it has turned into a chick. Sir, it's she who embroidered the chick. Silence. Are you saying that the embroidery just grew wings and flew away? Go back to your seat. Mind you all, whoever doesn't behave herself will be asked to leave. You! Go back and finish your work. What are you looking at? Focus on your own embroidery! Nice. Which maiden made this? Sir, Miss Nana here made this. She's a Shiwage. Come over, please. The year you were born, you father set up a banquet to which I was invited. And I asked the Buddha to bless you and gave you his statue. I'm so grateful, Sir. How did you learn embroidery? I was determined to be a royal maiden since a little girl, so I learned and practiced really hard. I was practicing till last night. Good, good. Good girl. Such a good girl. I like her. [A royal maiden should sing and dance well.] [You can dance, can't you?] [Come on.] [I can perform 36 martial arts,] [as well as 72 weapons.] [How can I don't know how to dance?] [Very good.] [I'm in for an eye treat today.] [Wait, wait.] [Miss Yuan' an, may I ask who taught you this dance?] [Several soldiers in the military.] You two may stop there. Nana, come over. My girl, your dance is not as good as your embroidery. You can't be a royal maiden dancing like this. Sir, I'm aware of my bad dancing. But I have another talent. What is it? Show me. Yes. [We don't have much time.] [So it would be unrealistic to teach you how to dance.] [Let's be creative and learn some tricks.] [Will it work?] [Of course it will.] [Tricks are most charming and adorable.] [Several girls have fallen for me because of my tricks.] - Amazing. Wonderful. How did she do that? That was impressive. Who did you learn it from? I'm aware that dancing is a compulsory course for a royal maiden. But I'm not interested in dancing since a little girl. However, among so many maidens who can dance really well, I'm the only one who can play tricks. Thus I may please my master in another way. That's true. My girl, you had it right. To us servants, it's all about pleasing the masters. Thank you, sir. After the selection, those who will stay in the palace are Mahana, Sala, Zhulama, Shinaka Jiwu, Liji, Xilami, Samila, Jihali, and Shiwag Nana. [So Ling Xi is resourceful.] [Now mission one is finished.] [Mu Le, wait and see.] [Your master is coming for you.] Those who were not called may be excused now. As for you, you are the perfect ones who have passed our examination. Behave yourselves in the palace. Keep your eyes and ears sharp. It's nothing to damage my reputation, but if you make a mistake and lose your lives, that would be terrible. Are we clear? Yes. [Where did he put the beads?] Why are you here? I'm here to serve you to take a bath and get dressed. Get out. I don't need you. Yes. Are you out of your mind? Why did you throw me here? I'm almost drowned. Talking to your master in such a loud voice, are you so desperate for the death penalty? Why did I throw you into the water? [Think about how he deceived you at that time,] [and how he tortured you at present.] [How can you let him die so easily?] [You should torture him to die little by little.] Countless clothes to wash, and not allowing me to eat and sleep, Was it you who found fault with me? Seems you're not that stupid. What for? What for? For I hate you. Lantern Festival or promises... you made them up, didn't you? Shwag Nana. You're not supposed to be here. I urge you to leave at once. You'd better listen, not only won't I leave, but I'll stay here. And I'll make you serve for me. Wishful thinking. It's so embarrassing. - Don't sleep. - Don't slack off. - We're waiting. Get up. What are you noisy in the morning? It was your vigil, but where were you last night? Last night... I was on my night shift, and Prince Ying took a fancy to me... so he made me serve him to have a bath. What? You served Prince Ying to have a bath? Yes. Why? Actually, it was more than that. - She is talking nonsense. I took a bath by the way. She took a bath by the way. Oh god, Prince Ying always keeps his nose clean. Personal maids like us never serve him to bathe. How...how could she bathe with Prince Ying? How dare she. Did you see anything? Perhaps I've seen all what you want to see. - What did you say? What is what we want to see? Eight-pack stones... very hard and very even. You... I'm telling you, the prince will have me wait on him to get changed. Wait on him to get changed? How dare she? It's too much. It pisses me off. I can't believe this new one is so crafty and shrewd. Prince Ying is innocent and kind, but unexpectedly he was enchanted by her. Stop it, you ignorant girls. Haven't you come across such cases in the palace? In my opinion, we'd behave well, and be nice to her from now on, for fear that she'll revenge on us in the future. [Yes, that's right.] Nana... The work you did these days is a new maid should do. But now you are not a new one, so just let someone else do the work. Yes, yes, that's right. Sister, you only need to stay in the palace, dusting and watering the flowers. That's it. And you don't need to eat flowers. We'll prepare a nice lunch and serve it to you. Yes, that's right. [There is no boundary for snobs indeed.] This is about the prince's dignity. Prince Ying hasn't been married yet. None of you are allowed to talk behind your back. Got it? Yes, we got it. Miss. The blue bat of mine is highly effective. Let it help you. Listen up! Order from Prince Ying. Anyone with clues about this woman will be rewarded! Mu Le, bastard! Don't bother looking for me. I will take Divine Beads back from you once I'm ready. Cloths! Have a look at my cloth! Have a look. Here it comes. - One pilaf. Have a taste, sir. It's our specialty. Are you here for meal, lady? I... Come here. Have a sit. Take a seat please. Pilaf is our specialty. We've also got coconuts. Have a sit. What would you like to have? That one. That one alone. No problem. One coconut, one pilaf. Here it comes. Please hold on, lady. One coconut, one pilaf. Give it a try. Our coconuts is known for the sweet and refreshing taste. Why did you spit it out? What's this? It stinks! Really? It's a fresh one. Try it yourself. It's good! That's a fresh one. I know! You're a foreigner. The flavor here does not fit your taste. It's alright. The coconut is on me. Try the Pilaf. Seriously? How dare you serve it? It's even worse than the coconut. What's wrong with the pilaf? Fine, don't bother. I'll go somewhere else. Wait. Lady! Hold on! Lady, you should pay for it. [I escaped from Ling Xi's place. I got no money with me.] It tastes so bad! How dare you charge me for that? Wait. I could serve you the coconut for free. But you've got to pay for the pilaf. Get lost! Help! Help! Kill the vampire here! Quickly! Beat her! Kill her! Kill the monster! Quickly! Beat her! Kill the monster! Keep hitting! Quickly! Go after her! Chase her down! There she is! Stop! Don't run! Stop running! Hit her! Capture the monster! Stop running! She's ahead! She should be ahead! Where is she? Where did she go? Search around! That way! Let's go! Look! What's this? Is this hers? It seems so! She does that way! Let's go! Come on! Move! Stop running! [What's wrong with me?] [I can't eat or drink, nor could I sleep.] [What happened to me?] Are you alright, Sister? [My eyeballs!] [Why did they turn red?] [Just like the blue bat!] [I know!] [It must be Ling Xi!] [He sent the blue bat to suck my blood.] [He turned me into a blood-sucking monster!] [No!] [I don't want it!] Are you ill, sister? I can take you to the doctor. Who are you? Why are you here at my place? Come here. It's alright, honey. Monster! Monster! Someone! Help! I'm not! Monster! No! I'm not! Finally, you're back. I've been waiting for so long. We robbed a lot of treasures! What a great day! Hurry up! Get inside see if it's empty. Let's split the treasure here. Exactly! Hurry! No problem! What a girl! Ghost! It's a ghost! Brother! What's wrong? Brother! Ghost! Her eyes are red! So scary! Calm down. There is no ghost. It's in the daytime. It must be someone's trick. Where is it? Right... right there. Who's that? Brother, she seems weak. She can't hold it any longer. She can't hold it? I could! Come here. Why did you set me up? Why did you send your bat to bite me and turn me like this? Miss Yuan'an, you need to learn to be grateful. My blue bat is so rare. It's your fortune that I used it to help change your blood. Look at you now. You could enjoy the thing you've never had before. Come on. Do it before they die. Do it as they're still warm. You're get better once you drink it. You won't suffer from coldness and hunger any more. Why would you set me up? I am helping you! Did you say your life is mine for I've saved you three times? Why would you do this to me? Do you really think that I am a slave to you for saving my life? It is so naive of you, Miss Yuan'an. So it's you who lured Mu Le with the name tag. Of course it is. Why would you frame me from time to time? It's not you that I'm going after. You just deserve it. You... Not you alone. The masked monk, the couple from Tang are all parts of the bigger plan. I'll kill you now! Want me dead? Then you've got to survive. You won't be able to seek revenge on me if you starve here. Think twice about it. Will you drink their blood? Or are you willing to die here? I wasted so much time here. Even my precious gets hungry. You demon! You won't end up well! Dear! Where are you? Buka! Could he be here? Father! Dear, where are you? I'll check over there! Spread out! Where are you, father? Hurry up! Buka! Father! Buka! Buka! Father! Are you alright, father? Wake up, Buka! Not now! Don't! Wake up, father! Prince. Ever since she escaped from palace, we've organized a defence in the city. We also searched people's houses. No clue about her. Where else could she be? She's got no wings to fly. What's going on? Let's have a check. Please help us master. Please revenge for my husband. Please, master. I'm begging you. Kowtow to master! Please, master! Please help us! Fine, I won't care about any law. I shall act according to the justice. I'll capture the monster for your revenge. Thank you, master! Thanks for your kindness. Thank you, master! Sincerely! Why won't you report to the government now that someone is dead? Why seek help from a wizard? Don't you know what happened? Report? The criminal isn't even a human. It won't work to report at all! What happened? Listen carefully. There is a vampire here recently. I saw it on my own. You know what? The vampire is a female one. She seems just like ordinary people. But she doesn't ever eat or drink. She gets excited once she sees blood. Days ago, I cut myself at my hand. She licked my cut. Then my hand got plumped, a huge one. What's more, the girl living near us who sells soybean milk, almost got eaten by her near the river. Have a look. Is she the monster? No way! They do look alike. Could it be Nana? I will go for the monster tonight. Is there anyone who would like to aid me? Me! I volunteer! Great. Let's capture the monster tonight! We'll go with them. Monster! A life for a life! Come out if you know my power! Monster! Come out! Come out! Get out! Guys, the monster is hidden inside! Let's rush in! Guys! Let's go! Monster! Where are you? Monster! Monster! Get out! Come out! Reveal yourself! Come out! Stop hiding, monster! Come out! Come out! What's that sound? There she is! Watch out! Are you a person or a monster? Chase her down! They're back! There they are! How is it? Tell us about the situation! Guys, I've searched around. But I didn't find the wizard. Mom, the fluffy one didn't bite me. Don't be silly. That's a monster. She is a powerful one. Her wings are even larger than cattle. It goes like this. Although there are many of us here, it's useless with quantity alone. Besides, even if we could capture her, do you dare fight with her? Do you? No. Not at all. Let me do it. Him? You alone? I want her alive. [I suppose she's murdered.] [There's her blood on the ground.] [It's not a crime if I drink it.] [She's dead anyway. I didn't kill her, right?] Help... Help... Save me! Over there! Let's go! Kill her! Get her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Get her alive! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Get her killed! There she is! Captured! Kill her! Kill her! Finally, I got you! Kill her! Kill her! Please calm down. She has been poisoned. She can't move now. Who are you? Why are you so aggressive even after being drugged? I want her dead! Kill her in revenge of my husband! Auntie. She has to be taken by me no matter who or what she is. You are from the government! I am from the government. Then why don't you act for our interest? Exactly! According to the law at Suoluo, no one is allowed to act lynch. Now that I'm from the government, I will definitely act in your place. Seriously? We all saw it when the monster bit her husband! Exactly! We all saw it! Kill her! This monster here killed my man together with other villagers. They just died not long ago. I won't allow you take her away. [Believe in love, Yuan'an.] [When you two are at war,] [kiss him mouth to mouth.] Look... She's getting angry! Capture her, guys! Kill her now! Kill her! Kill the monster! Beat her to death! [ I find you in this night fantasy. ] [ Even the blade seems like the colored glaze. ] [ In order to be with you, I'm willing to fight with destiny.] [ It's a great encounter that we meet each other. ] [ I find you in this night fantasy. ] [ I won't give up no matter how many barriers in front of me. ] I remember! I remember everything! [ Let's have a toast, to Tang and to the world. ] [ Let's leave in the misty rain. ] Yuan'an. You're Yuan'an! I am Mu Le. Your Mu Le! The monster is enchanting us! I'll kill you. Kill her. Kill her. No. You can't harm her. The young master is enchanted by her. They are on the same side. Please, please, listen to me. Kill her! Kill her! She is not a monster. She is human. Her name is Ye Yuan'an. I don't care. We don't care about it. Kill her! Come on! Go on! Kill her! - Don't harm her! Kill her! Kill! Yuan'an. Yuan'an. Wake up. You are awake. You remember me. Yuan'an. I remember you now, and forever. Go away. You know what, I hate you, Mu Le. Yuan'an, I never lie to you. I had some kind of medicine. I remembered Suoluo, but forgot about Tang. And you. I hate you anyway. I'll kill you. Yuan'an, I would die a thousand times if you really wanted to kill me. Yuan'an. I'm sorry. You're sorry? You harmed Tianshu, Minghui and Zhao Lanzhi. You harmed my dad, my mom and Yuanning. How can you compensate them? Yuan'an. - Tell me. How can I compensate you? Give the Divine Beads back to me. No. You would save your father's life Yuan'an. I owe you. I'll never pay you back for my whole life. But I'd rather dying than giving you the Divine Beads. You think I can't kill you? If the peace comes after my death, I would rather die. But I can't give you the Divine Beads, because of the ambition of the Empress of Tang. She'll use them to conquer the world. I don't care about it! I only care about the life of people I love. We shared the common interest. You can't be so selfish, Yuan'an. I'm selfish? Yeah, I'm so selfish that saved you out of the Ghost Market, and kept you in my house. Now it's time for me to bear the consequences. Listen, if you don't give them back to me today... You'll kill me, right? Right. I would be dead without you. My life is yours. Take it. If you don't give me the Beads, you are doing nothing From now on, you have nothing to do with me. We are enemies when we meet next time. Yuan'an, don't go. Yuan'an! Yuan'an! Yuan'an! I can't find you anywhere. You're here. Are you okay? Shut up, go to hell! It...really can help me regrow my arm? Yes. Please, general. God bless me. My arm was cut off by Queen Tuoyue. Now it is intact as before. Even more flexible. How can you enjoy such benefit alone? Don't forget about your promise. Yuan'an. Yuan'an, where are you? - Your highness. Yuan'an. Your highness, have you remembered all about Tang? It doesn't help. She's gone. What...what about things before Tang? Do you remember? Does it matter? Yuan'an. Yuan'an. Yuan'an. Nice! Nice! Cool! Nice! Yuan'an. Are you mad? You spoiled everthing. Let's go. Come on . Zhenzhen. Your joke really makes me laugh. My queen, everything is true. How dare I joke about it? You mean that the fake maid is from Tang. who was enchanted into a monster, Prince Ying was looking desperately for a monster. Zhenzhen, he is one of the royal families. How could he do this? Did it really happen or you made it up? My queen, it's my mistake. Please forgive me. Zhenzhen. Take Prince Ying back. It's so improper of him to chase after a monster. Go on. Yes, my queen. Yuan'an. Yuan'an. Nana. Nana. Nana, don't leave. What did &quot;Nana&quot; do to make you so painful? I remember that the girl married to you her name is Nana. But after you went to Tang, she also disappeared for no reason. Son, why did you go out for such a long time? All the servants are looking for you. You passed out along the road. It's my fault to make you worried. Ying, you are the prince of Suoluo. You can't do whatever you want. You can't be careless about your status. Do you understand? Mother, I'm not careless. I should pay more attention to her because of my position. Mother, don't you forget that I got married with Nana? What's going on with you? Do you know who you are? Of course I know. In Suoluo, I'm the noble prince. But in Tang, I'm the poor servant getting bullied by others. If it were not her, you would never see me again, mother. If she can come for me from Tang to Suoluo, I can't disappoint her. What's the matter? General Bokai is seeking an audience. Great. My queen. General, your arm... What happened? My queen, my prince. Look. It's my new arm. Limbs are not like teeth of child, how can they regrow? Not to say you don't believe it. Initially, after I broke my arm, I thought I would be a disabled, useless man. But who can imagine, god blessed me. God sent me a magical cure-all. So my arm regrew. Cure-all? Yes, cure-all. The cure-all can not only regrow my arm, it can even make people rejuvenate and gain immortality. Really? I don't dare to take the cure-all by myself. What do you mean? I want to share the cure-all with Prince and Queen. And with the wounded soldiers, who fights to protect our Suoluo Kingdom. To make their body recover. It's so nice of you to have the kindness. I'm here to invite Prince and Queen, to visit our army camp tomorrow. We will share the cure-all at the feast. Well, I see. Thanks for General's kindness. I'd love to go, but I have important things to do. Hold on, my prince. I heard that you are looking for someone. What did you do with her! Since you know it, will you give the honor to attend it? Okay. I see. I, Bokai, will welcome Prince and Queen with respect. - Open it. Miss Yuan'an Do you like your face now? Cut the crap! You are a magical creature. You know that. After drinking your blood, General Bokai regained his lost arm. Isn't that a good thing? Stop talking shit of magical creature! I will kill you sooner or later! Relax, I haven't finished my words. There are many wounded soldiers in Suoluo Kingdom. If I share you, the magical creature, with them. They will all be recovered like General Bokai. What I did makes you hate me like this! Hate you? How could I hate you? I ought to like you. Only by torturing you, can make my enemy feel worse than death. I will kill you first. Miss Yuan'an, Just have a nice sleep and be an obedient blue bat. I have seen many things like narrow escape. Wait and see who will be the final winner. The military music is so fluent and imposing. What do you think, Ying? Great. There are really a wealth of talents following General. Thanks, my Prince. But, please take a look at these players. They used to be brave soldiers fighting in the war. Everyone is talented. But unfortunately, they lost their legs or eyes in fights. Now they can only enhance morale in this way. This is their fighting bravery. In my mind, it's the same with enhancing morale and killing enemies on battlefield. Pass my word, reward! You are so generous, my Prince. But my Prince. The treasure cannot make my soldiers recover. But my god-tricks can make them recover. General Bokai. Today you invited my mother and me here. Aren't you going to show your cure-all? Why bother to act in this way? Right. Today I invited queen and prince here. Because I want you to witness my special god-trick. I want those wounded soldiers recover as usual. Let healthy soldiers all get the god-trick power. There really exists such cure-all? Soldiers! Take the creature here. Queen, Prince. Soldiers. Several days before, my arm was still broken. But just within few days, my arm regrew just because of its blood! Her blood made my broken arm recover. It's the gift god gave to Suoluo Kingdom. I dare not take by myself. I'm gonna to share her with you. With my brother-in-arms who fought together with me! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Ying, what are you going to do? Soldiers. Now I will use the knife cutting her throat. Feed my soldiers with her blood. - God Bless my Suoluo Kingdom. Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Who dare to touch her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! It's an order! Offender, kill! I don't need you to save me. Yuan'an, I won't let you get in trouble. Ying! Open the cage! Open it! Attention, everybody! If you drink the blood of the blue bat, your broken arms will regrow. If you eat her flesh, you can gain immortality! What are you waiting for? Come on! How dare you! How dare you offend the prince like this? Didn't you remember? Ying is the Prince of Suoluo Dynasty? My queen. These soldiers sacrificed everything for Suoluo Kingdom. They could have been recovered today But just because of the monster, our prince stopped them like this. Is that fair for us? Mu Le. Hand me over. They are just using me to induce you. Ying. Just hand over the monster. You forgot, you are the prince of Suoluo Kingdom. Did you want to protect the monster like your brother? Mother. Sorry for disobeying your order. Ying. Yuan'an. I cannot lose you again. Mu Le. Although I didn't get beads back this time. You remembered everything. I think my trip is worthwhile. Follow my order this time! Hand me over. Soldiers. Every life has its meaning. If you really want to kill this blue bat, drink her blood and eat her flesh, what's the difference between you and blood-sucking monsters? Soldiers, brothers! Our Prince, used to be the most brave warrior of Suoluo Kingdom. But today, just because of a monster, he defy against the brothers he used to fight with. He doesn't deserve to be our Prince! Kill blue bat! Kill Prince Ying! Kill Prince Ying! Kill blue bat! Kill Prince Ying! Kill blue bat! Stop! Stop it all! Ying! Hand over the monster, come on! Will you die for the monster? Regardless of our own lives? Ying, no no! What happened? What? Nine Divine Beads bless all living beings. Beads! Mother, are you okay? I give you the last chance. Kill the monster! Sorry mother, I cannot obey. Mother, She is not monster, nor Nana. Her name is Ye Yuan'an. She adopted me in Tang Dynasty. She fed me with food, gave me clothes. And treat me like family. She is my savior, mom. Ying, you really thought, you were a poor kid wandering on the streets? Someone feeds you and gives you clothes, then she can be your mater? You are the Prince of Suoluo Kingdom. And maybe the King of Suoluo Kingdom later! No matter who I am, and whatever my identity. I know clearly, we have already been a couple. Once in Tang, even in Suoluo You also held the wedding for us. She is my only wife. This life, only death do us part. There is actually such weird magic. I don't care how many times your have married before. That doesn't count! Before I don't know the truth behind. In a word, you cannot be in relations! According to Tang's rules, I have already did the wedding ceremony with him. God witnessed it, then why doesn't it count? Ridiculous! Ying, you brought Nine Divine Beads back, is to save your father's life. At present, for this lady, you broke the rules set by yourself! You disappointed me! You don't deserve to be the Prime Minister! Let alone take charge of Nine Divine Beads! Hand it over. I used Nine Divine Beads arbitrarily, and broke my own rules. I deserve the punishment. I will hand Nine Divine Beads over now. I only want Yuan'an. Prince Ying was obsessed with beauty, and led to serious blunders. Guards, take Prince Ying away, and put him into prison. He shall take scapula puncture and wait to be sentenced. Since the girl has come from afar. we shall let her try the burning sun of Suoluo. Have her under the blazing sun. Mother, it's my fault. I'll take all the consequences. But please let off Yuan'an. Oh, Ying, This is no time for you to worry about her. This is the royal rule. There is no exception. You and I can't change it. Guards, get them out of here. Mother. Yes, your highness. Mother. Mother. Ying. Brother. father and mother, they eventually get you out of the pagoda. Congratulations. Now father is weak and mother is sad. And Suoluo can't run without a leader. I'm governing the country for you. Good, it's good. It doesn't matter for me to be the prince or the supervisor. Brother, look, I was the one who came to see you a few days ago, but today, you're the one who came to see me. You never know what will happen next. What are you saying? That's all what you deserved. You are captivated by the temptress, and killed a general with the beads. Do you realize your fault? That's not true, brother. Yuan'an is not a temptress. She is not a temptress. You're speaking for her by now. You know what, Ying, according to the law of Suoluo, every single crime of you is a capital offense. And now your scapulae were nailed. If you're still unrepentant, there's only one way for you. If you admit your mistake, maybe you can live. Brother, to you, to father and mother, and to whole Suoluo, I did nothing wrong. All right. I have warned you. Mu Le. Easy, take it easy. Take a good look at him first, His wound will heal itself. However, he has to go through the pain every single day, over and over again. How can you be so cruel to a prince? Cruel? From the day he abused the beads, he was not a prince anymore. It's my fault. It's all my fault. That's right. This is all your fault. So I'm going to give you a chance. What do you want? Ying or the beads, you should have a preference. You can take the beads away and Ying will die, or leave the beads and you will die. Is that a promise? It's up to you to make a decision. I want to talk to him. Yes, if you like. Mu Le, wake, wake up, Mu Le. Look at me. Is that you, Yuan'an? It's me. I thought I was dreaming. Pretty nice. I wish it could be like this all the time, and never wake up. It's me, Mu Le. Open your eyes and look at me. Yuan'an. It's really you. Why are you here? You're quite capable, aren't you? Why can't you get out here? Now I regret for buying you on the market. If I hadn't known you at the time, I wouldn't hate you right now, Zhao Lanzhi and Tianshu wouldn't have been dead, and I wouldn't have come to Suoluo and been stuck here. Yuan'an, in my life, the last thing I regret is that I had a crush on you. It was the best time I ever had when I was with you. I'm sorry, Mu Le. If I don't bring the beads back, all the people will die, I' sorry. Yuan'an, you should get back. I feel sorry for you, and sorry for Master Tianshu. If you can go back safely, I can fulfill my promise to Master Tianshu in another way. Don't cry. Don't you blame me? If all of these are my karmas, I'm supposed to take all of it. For you, I'll never regret. I can't believe Ying and the temptress love each other deeply. How is it? Have you made your choice? I'm talking to you. Did you make your choice? Ying or the beads? You eventually chose the beads. You were acting before, pretending you love Ying so much. Are you crazy? You chose the beads but threw them away. Do you want to die? Who told you I chose the beads? Set Mu Le free right now. Are you serious? You don't care about your own life? I tell you to let him go right now. Guards, take her away. Yes. You'd live up to what you said. See, mother. The girl chose Ying. It seems they love each other sincerely. Mother, I want to speak for brother. What's your plan? Though whoever breaks the law will be punished, everything happens for a reason. He was forced to resort to the beads. I'd like to ask you to pardon him. It's enough to make him relegated and deported, and never let him return to Suoluo. Heng, there were grudges between you two. I'm happy to see you plead for him at this time. You're both my children. I can't abandon either of you. Since you got an idea, I'll leave it to you. Rest assured, mother. Prince. What are you doing here? I got the order from the supervisor, Prince Heng. Prince Ying, please come with me. Prince Ying, do you confess your crime? No. Do you regret? No. Do you sincerely love that temptress? Yes. Are you willing to give up your status for her? I can give up my life for her. Then as you wish, I'm ordered to secretly execute Prince Ying. Go ahead. Are you all right? That's pretty good. Ying, I give you one more chance. If you choose to go with the girl, you can't return to Suoluo anymore. Are you willing to give up your power and throne? Mother, since I said Yuan'an is my only wife, I'll never leave her. As for the power and throne, I'm willing to give up. Since you love each other, I'll help you fulfill you wishes. But Ying, you can avoid the death penalty, but you should accept punishment. All your skills originated from Suoluo. So you can't take them out. You can't get rid of the nails in your scapulae.
