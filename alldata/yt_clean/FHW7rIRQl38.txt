Growing up parents got me a guitar Said you can do anything kid you can go far You can be the president fireman race cars, The sky's the limit kid so shoot for the stars So I strummed that guitar every day Found a passion for music never went away I joined a couple bands and played a few shows Tried to impress the girl in the front row But soon enough everything starts to change As you grow up nobody treats you the same They try take your future and make it real safe You could be a doctor accountant or something sane BUT YO! What ever happened to the sky was the limit? I fell in love with music never thought it was a gimmick I worked so hard on every tune and every single lyric My whole identity dependent on being artistic Now you want to strip that away? Cuz if I make it to the top what does that really say? That you shouldn't have given up, that you made the mistake But if I fail you feel much better 'bout pickin' it lame... ...right?

I'd rather be dead on the outside than inside A bullet to the head than 25 to life In a cubicle alone just trying get by Building someone else's dream instead of building mine If you're hearin' me, this is meant to inspire If you have a dream or if you have desires A girl in your life that's makin' you feel on fire Go fight for her man!
