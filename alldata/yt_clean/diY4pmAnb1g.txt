The collection contained all muscle cars several Plymouth Superbirds, a Big Black Corvette, a brand that had, I think 11 miles on it. Lincolns, Jaguars, From that episode, there we didn't have the time to feature because of time constraints for the video.

When you got in the car, If you look at it, the floor a lower center of gravity. So the car didn't have to be as tall as other cars in the road lowered. - [Billy] And actually If you look at this door, it almost looks like it was chopped from the factory. - [Interviewer] Yeah right. - [Billy] It's a little down on top. - [Interviewer] And look look at how long that door is.

He was a championship occasionally have a monkey in like this and he would race with a a little helmet and little seat. Tim flocks monkey's name was Jocko Flocko. - And actually, some of the drivers didn't want him in there because they said he could open the door and see where they have a hole cut on the floor where it's checked the front tire. - Is that an automatic push button? - Yeah. - Well, that's some rare stuff here but here's another homologation car. - Yeah. It had a slope front - Homoligation is a term that is used for requiring a certain be manufactured and sold before a similar car like that So over there we have a Turino Talladega. We have a cyclone here. We have a Pontiac two plus two and in the other building, there was a a Monte Carlo with a slant I think it was called a it included this wing. - Two plus two is on the door - Yup. A slanty back window and an extended nose, which but other than that, it just a regular old car. During our tour with Billy his knee started to hurt him. So his wife Carol Lee was for Billy for the rest of our tour. - [Carol] That was my car. - The Pinto. - [Interviewer] Oh Pinto. the only car I think I - [Interviewer] Huh, you buy it new? - [Carol] We bought it new. - [Interviewer] Wow. - [Carol] And, feet here. - [Carol] Yeah.

I didn't know they had that much power. (upbeat music) - [Interviewer] Now here's something I know dangerously little about 1969 Camaro Z 28 and what else did we have here? Is a pile of stuff there. It looks like a sports car probably an MGB or an MG So if we were at an average place I'd run over and look at that Midget but there's so many other I'm not going to look at it. Now look at the sizes, Lincoln. This is probably a 40 Lincoln, Probably not a continental but look at the size of this thing. This is a two seater car. It's a three window coupe, and in the back window, Look at the size of his trunk. The roof ends here, but the So there's this probably a little passenger compartment there where two people sat. So this huge vehicle So we're all over the map here as far as cars, this is this is one that I could It's a 63 Ford Fairlane 500 sport roof. They started off just for a little while with a 221 cubic inch then developed a 260 for a little while and then it became a 289 but just a nice tidy up in the early Cobras. You know, the early AC before the 289 came out, or so had 260 cubic inch engines and that engine came a very basic little So we should go probably back Oh, a nice Jaguar. Oh, a couple of nice. Yeah. Pretty nice Jaguars. Well, my, my eye goes Is it X K 140? - [Billy] Yeah. 56 miles. - A 3.6 liter double What a beauty. How, how much restoration - [Billy] It hadn't had a lot done. I painted it. - [Interviewer] Was a - We had to do a little engine work to. - Do the mechanics yourself as well? - [Billy] Let's see. Daddy I had, I had one of my Jaguar mechanics as a friend, some of Yeah. - [Interviewer] That's a great car. So this is a V12. Huh, water monster. Let's see what the flashlight coming on boy has got hood high this run? - [Billy] Runs great. - [Interviewer] It's four carburetors, double overhead cam. V12 motor. Man. And then we have a Jaguar sedan over here. Is that a Mark 2? - [Billy] Papa got. - [Interviewer] 240. - [Billy] That's a little Jaguar. The motor looks just like the other sixes but it's a small one. - [Interviewer] Yeah. I love it. Yeah. Is this a right-hand drive? We'll get back to the four speed. - [Billy] That's had It's just the way I found it. - [Interviewer] Just like with this paint. So it's a right hand driver. The four speed is that overdrive as well. - [Billy] Yeah. Very nice. They used to race these in Alright. More cars. How do you like that? All very nice. El Camino. Wow. Look at that. It's got the factory Oh, it's a big block of 396. That is 396. El Camino. It looks like a 66 automatic bucket seats. That's a sweetheart. Wow. I could drive that car Oldsmobile 98. Well, he did find unusual This could be a four-door but He got a convertible, a So that's, I don't know probably not, but maybe it is. This is amazing that That on a normal episode, we at that car salivating over it. If we found it in Northern Wow. Look at that 55. It's great. But here there's so many We just walked by and mentioned, Oh this is a 55 convertible. I feel guilty about not paying to these cars. But you know, that's, that's, no matter where we found just another car. Cause there were other cars the moon. I was, I almost drove my 39 but in the rain. Woody's are not good in the rain though. Oh yeah. Well, we'll go down there too. It's almost too much to Here we go. Okay. So just more cars of Billy's eclectic taste 57 I guess 300 next to a Jaguar XJ 12 L this is a beauty. It looks like about a 64 Well, this is the Roadster. So you have a black car where black and white interior, black convertible top but it's got the fiberglass So when this convertible top came down this covered over the rear this speedster look almost like a Porsche speedster, I mean, if this were washed I can't imagine how 58 Chevy's you know, for a Chevy's looking for 57 Chevy's but now 58 Chevy's have and I've really learned There's a two door hardtop and there's a convertible Now let's see what they had interesting motors. So you could get a six a 283 where you get a 348 and this one's got a 348. You can tell it's got these and out the valve cover and 3, 2 barrels. So this was the high I don't know what kind It looks like an automatic and this engine was kind of the basis for an engine that came the beach boys sang a song about 409 a 409 was an engine. She's a real find my 409. Well, it kinda, this is the basis that the 409 started out as This is probably a beautiful car. The paint on here is probably fabulous and here is a 58 Chevy white top automatic on a column. It's got kind of a tri-color and let's see what motor this has in it. So it's got a 283. So that's got the smaller That was the biggest and this had the 283, You can also get a six cylinder in here. So this, when I talked to I forgot what year it is probably 68 or so it's got, or maybe 69. It's got a 454 and it's very built. I remember him told told me it's a very built and this is a convertible. So it's got a hard top. It lifts off. Nice, nice, nice car They don't rust haha.

This one's got a 440 gear, but you see it's got these old big tires on. - [Interviewer] Yeah it equals out. - [Billy] So it, I drove it got better gas mileage than the 41 with. - The 12. - Now I'm on the Toyota. It was a V8. - Oh, V8 - [Billy] 305. - [Interviewer] So that's to the original transmission. - [Billy] Yeah. I just adapt to ring. I just, I can then bolt it and build a. - Was a nice swap. - Open the door, look inside it. - [Interviewer] Oh, is that beautiful. Look at that speedometer. Beautiful. What a dashboard.
