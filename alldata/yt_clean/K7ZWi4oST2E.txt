....to start this recipe, we are going to use 1 cup of raw chickpeas, we are going to place them in a container, with 1 liter of water, and we are going to leave them to soak for approximately 12 hours, or overnight, the next morning, we are going to remove the a Soaking water, and we are going to rinse the chickpeas very well, we are going to wash them with abundant water and we are going to soak them again, for approximately between 8 and 12 hours, when that time passes, you will see that some bubbles appear, they are going to remove 3 tablespoons of that soaking water and they are going to reserve it, they are going to store it in a glass container for later, in the meantime we are going to remove the remaining water, and we are going to rinse the chickpeas very well, come on to place the chickpeas in the blender, with 2 cups of water, (1/2 liter of water) and we are going to blend very well, the idea is to blend until the chickpeas are crushed well, we have to have a creamy consistency, like this like this, and once it has that consistency, add 1/2 more liter of water, two more cups of water, ok... and blend again, well, now we are going to filter the preparation,... .we have a fabric filter, in a jug and we are going to separate what would be the chickpea milk from the bagasse..... and if it is liking the recipe don't forget to leave a like and subscribe to the channel , for more recipes like this, .... we are going to press, to try to obtain the greatest amount of liquid, and we already have for this aside the liquid with which we are going to make the yogurt, and here we have what would be the bagasse, the solid rest, with which we are going to make some delicious hamburgers.... ...when we finish the yogurt recipe, and in We are going to put the chickpea milk in a pot and we are going to bring it to the maximum heat, we are going to stir so that it does not stick to the surface of the pot, at maximum heat for about 4 minutes, after 4 or 5 minutes, we lower the heat there, you will notice that the preparation will begin to thicken, do not stop stirring, so that it does not burn, and when it begins to boil, more or less it is 5 more minutes , in total there are between 10 and 15 minutes of cooking, when it is ready, they remove it from the fire and I suggest you stir it to be able to cool it, because when we go to add the liquid from the soaking of the chickpeas, which is what will help us to ferment, and make the yogurt, this preparation has to be lukewarm, not hot, it has to be lukewarm, once it has cooled a little, we are going to place it in a container, the container in which we are going to prepare the yogurt, it has to be glass, it cannot be metal, we already verified that the temperature of the preparation is lukewarm, so we are going to add now the water from the chickpea soak, well let's mix well, and now it's just patience, just wait, I suggest you leave it for more or less 12 hours, cover, leave a little open, when you cover so that a little bit of air, if you leave it in a warm place better (20 - 25 oc) , here where I live the temperature is warm at this time of year and it's perfect, but I left it 12 hours, you depend on where you live , if it's hot it will ferment much faster look how I stay 12 hours later, it was incredible super firm, ideal for making any type of preparation, both sweet dishes and savory dishes, for breakfast, I recommend flavoring it, the first option is with blueberries, we hydrate dried blueberries in warm water, place them in the blender, with a little yogurt, the yogurt has to be very fresh, and a few drops of vanilla essence, we blend it and we already have blueberry flavor yogurt, you cannot imagine how tasty this flavor is, it is incredible, you have to try this version, the second option is with plums dehydrated, we also hydrate them in warm water, remove the pit, and put them in a blender, with the yogurt, it is not necessary to add any type of sweetener, because dehydrated fruits are sweet, this option with plums is unmissable, it is really tasty, and this 100% vegetable natural yogurt is ideal to eat at any time of the day, .....the third option is with a sweet fruit, such as mango, only mango and yogurt. it's a fantastic combination. I'm going to use golden flaxseeds, you can use brown flaxseeds or you can use chia seeds, I'm going to put the seeds the ground seeds, with 6 tablespoons of water, I'm going to soak them for hydration, more or less 15 minutes, and in a container I am going to place what would be the bagasse (the rest of the vegetable milk), which is dry, because I applied a lot of pressure and it is very dry, so now I am going to add the seeds, which are the ones that are going to help to bind these burgers, I am going to put pepper, salt and seasoning, I am going to use cumin, you can use any seasoning that you like, that you have at home, I am going to add 1 cup of grated zucchini, if you do not have zucchini, you can use carrot, you can use spinach, any vegetable will be very good, we are going to mix these ingredients, I am also going to add half a chopped onion, I am going to integrate well until a dough is formed, and I am going to add rice flour, more or less between 2 and 3 tablespoons, the consistency it is perfect for assembling hamburgers, I tell you that you can also assemble meatballs, with this same preparation, you can make small meatballs, I made hamburgers, but you can also make meatballs, I am going to assemble a cylinder and from the cylinder I am going to take parts and assembling the burgers, they can be made and can be frozen, they can be cooked in the pan, and they can be cooked in the oven, if you want me to publish more vegan yogurt recipes, leave me below in the comments, a ( yes I do) , and in the next videos I will publish more recipes, thank you very much for watching the video and if you have any questions or want to make any suggestions, you can leave it here below in the comments, I invite you to join me on
