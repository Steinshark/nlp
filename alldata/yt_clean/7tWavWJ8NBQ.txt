Let's talk about me We'll start with some basics, I live across the street (audience laughs) It's not funny yet but (audience laughs) I drink a lot of Mountain Dew, okay. It's like my only vice. I drink a lot of Mountain Dew. I'm in that 7-Eleven okay? Getting refills. I'm in there so often that everyone who works in that 7-Eleven, When they see me, Yeah. Do you guys know I have to drink not to have (audience laughs) It is a lot. (audience laughs) It's so much Mountain Dew, you guys. It's a lot, it's a... For me to walk into 7-Eleven &quot;Mountain Dew Guy,&quot; and to be like, (audience laughs) &quot;He drinks more Mountain Dew &quot;by tattooing his face?&quot; The guy's like, &quot;Yeah, what aren't you getting about this, Yeah, I also know just so we're all (audience laughs) Yeah, yeah. When I tattooed my face, When I got my face tattooed, when I got my face tattooed, &quot;There will be positives and there will be negatives,&quot; I wanna be honest with you guys. It has been mostly negatives so far, okay? (audience laughs) I can't even think of one positive. I'm gonna be real with you guys. So I'm here I'm also here to say, if some of you are thinking probably don't, okay? (audience laughs) I saw some of you come in and I don't think you could handle it, (audience laughs) Could not hack it. It's rough out here. (audience laughs) All my tattoos are real. I shouldn't have to say that but sometimes after shows &quot;Wow, crazy man, &quot;you look crazy, And I have to be like, &quot;What are you talking about right now? &quot;What do you think, (audience laughs) &quot;I just wake up every day and Like, what would I stand to gain from drawing fake tattoos I just wake up every morning and I'm drawing them on like, &quot;I just want old people (audience laughs) That's what I'm about, I just wake up every day and &quot;I just want to struggle (audience laughs) One time after a show, &quot;Don't be so hard on yourself.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;will you give me a job?&quot; And she was like, (audience laughs) &quot;Come back! &quot;I need work. (audience laughs) I travel a lot for this job. This is my only job, but you know what? I travel a lot and they're like pretty cool. Not very many people I live here in Utah, some of you are not on board, okay? (audience laughs) I have a lot of weird experiences here that don't happen anywhere else. I'll give you an example. Once I got done with a show, I get done with a show and an older gentleman so old, so, so old, you guys. Have you ever seen someone so old that if they were getting you'd be like, &quot;Uh, is anybody else &quot;Do I have to stop, (audience laughs) &quot;How close are we (audience laughs) &quot;What is the danger level here?&quot; and he comes right up to me and &quot;Hey man, I love your comedy, &quot;good job, (audience laughs) I don't even know what that means, okay. &quot;Off the what, &quot;What are you, the coolest guy &quot;You know?&quot; He's just like, like what? (audience laughs) Just assumes I'm gangster I am not gangster, I'm the least gangster person ever. I cry at the end of Toy Story 3 (man cheers) That guy cried so hard, all right? Me and him, Yeah man, just not gangster, just makes no sense. I got done, I'm at a grocery store, just a regular lady, She doesn't notice me she's standing there. She turns around, she makes this noise, and then she left. (audience laughs) She just left, (audience laughs) Like yeah, uh, is anybody? (audience laughs) Is anybody else watching her, They were not. Yeah, so pretty sure she got away with like a lot of free stuff. (audience laughs) Oh, man. (laughs) I don't know. You guys would be despite all the weird interactions are weird about my tattoos or don't know what it's like the weirdest interactions, are always with other people Not a fan of other heavily tattooed people, okay? Yeah, I'm calling it, I know everything I need to know with a lot of tattoos, Your parents hit you, you like to bring a snake (audience laughs) I get it, you know? I don't wanna have it's terrible. I'll give you an example, okay. I'm at Walmart, everything's going fine. I'm in line a lot in my jokes, I'm in line, I look over and and he's bald head, in black and gray tattoos. His entire head is like he's got skulls and stuff. Obviously, he got all these tattoos I feel some of you being awkward. He's not here, (audience laughs) Also, I'm allowed (audience laughs) So I see him, he sees me and it's locked in for a second and immediately I'm like, &quot;this guy's gonna try (audience laughs) Have you ever just seen someone and they're just so white trash you don't have the energy (audience laughs) (exhales loudly) So this guy, This dude in Walmart covered He comes up to me, the first thing he says, &quot;Hey man, (audience laughs) &quot;What?&quot; I've done zero time, everyone. I've never been to jail This guy's, he's just making an assumption about me, And I was like, you know, I'll meet him halfway. I'll just mess with him a little. So I was like, &quot;Did five years in Azkaban, (audience laughs) &quot;Yeah, yup.&quot; (audience laughs) He wanted to impress me so bad, &quot;Word, all right, (audience laughs) &quot;All that time in prison and &quot;you didn't read one Harry Potter book?&quot; (audience laughs) Seems kinda like a waste, I don't know what he's up to now but I'm pretty sure it's not reading, so. (audience laughs) It's not, not good. Oh man, (audience laughs) Super glad. I have told that joke before and I did a show in Wyoming once, Wyoming, a dumpster fire pretending don't know if you guys-- (audience laughs) knew that. (audience laughs) It is one big Walmart parking lot. It is not good. (audience laughs) There's nothing there. Why are you there? Anyway, doesn't matter. (audience laughs) I'm in Wyoming, doing a show to It's a pretty big audience, all right. And I say that line, complete silence, all right. I'm just like, &quot;that makes so much sense, (audience laughs) It's rough. And then, a lady in the front row She goes, (audience laughs) &quot;What, what are you saying? (audience laughs) &quot;How, how? &quot;The first part of that joke &quot;to jail a day in my life. &quot;It's not even a real place, &quot;Why are we-- &quot;Why are we having this conversation?&quot; (audience laughs) And then she goes, &quot;that's that place in San Francisco.&quot; (audience laughs) &quot;No, no, that is not correct, okay? (audience laughs) &quot;You are thinking of Alcatraz, okay? &quot;Which has been closed &quot;So you're not even right &quot;I don't, you know?&quot; And then the audience is like, it's just so weird. It's the weirdest experience, and then she says, &quot;Agree to disagree.&quot; (audience laughs) Like that's not how anything works, (audience laughs) &quot;Why is this happening And one guy in the audience was like, And I was like, &quot;No one got anyone. &quot;She is so wrong, you know?&quot; I wanted to be so mean but I was like, so, you know. (audience laughs) The punishment fits the crime, really. (audience laughs) So bad, so awful. So yeah, don't go there, I shouldn't, like I have my life together. I do not, as my life I sneezed on a baby recently. Yeah, that's a thing I did. I was holding a baby and I just hard sneezed into its face. So hard, you know? And my friend is standing there &quot;Hey man, real quick, &quot;did you just sneeze (audience laughs) And I was like, And he was like, And I was like, &quot;and I was like, &quot;so I was like, &quot;I could drop the baby or &quot;I could sneeze &quot;You know, those are my two options.&quot; And he was like, &quot;sneeze the other way.&quot; And I was like, &quot;That third option was not apparent (audience laughs) &quot;It just didn't occur (audience laughs) He's like, I was like, &quot;At least I'm not from Wyoming, Oof. (laughs) Ugh, I get it from my mom, Is anyone else relate to that? She's a wild woman, all right. Those people get it, and so, my mom, I laughed at my mom she started yelling at me. You know, Have you ever, by the way, like falling down in the aisle I laughed, She told me her dog had diabetes, okay, and I started laughing so hard. No, it's so fat, It's so big and &quot;It's not funny. And I'm like, &quot;a propane tank with legs, There were so many clues. He's huge, of course he's diabetic. And then also I caught her feeding him Doritos Locos Tacos (audience laughs) It's like, &quot;the more expensive tacos, (audience laughs) It's true, she goes, It's like, what? &quot;Did he tell you that?&quot; What is happening here? Also, he's a chihuahua, It's ridiculous. My mom... So we're a Jewish family. She names the dog Mazel Tov, okay. She's telling me about She takes him to the vet, she's got one of these talks to their animals like So he's like, sitting there He looks the dog right in his stupid, fat, No one feel bad for him, We can make fun of him. Also, he's a dog, at all times, okay? (audience laughs) So she looks, and goes, (audience laughs) It's like, that is incorrect. That seems anti-Semitic. I know it's not, but (audience laughs) when she told the story. (audience laughs) She's out of control. She bought a computer recently. She wouldn't let me then like an hour after she bought it, she calls me and &quot;Hey, I'm locked out of my computer, &quot;Can you get into my computer for me?&quot; I'm like, &quot;What do you mean, And she's like, I was like, &quot;I don't know how to get So she gets mad, She calls me back She's like, &quot;got back into my computer, (audience laughs) &quot;No, no, Mom, you're the (audience laughs) You forgot Caps Lock was on. &quot;That is not what a hacker is, (audience laughs) I'm a hacker, no, (audience laughs) So bad, I don't know. (audience laughs) I have no right Beyond sneezing on a baby, I'm like really bad at everything. I don't even know how debt works. I recently found that out when my dentist sent me Yeah, my dentist sent me The collection agency calls my phone. I answer, and they're like, &quot;give us the money.&quot; And I was like, &quot;No, I'm just not going to.&quot; And he was like, &quot;What?&quot; And I was like, &quot;if I don't give you money? And he was like, And I was like, (audience laughs) &quot;Yeah, my credit's already really bad. &quot;My credit score is so bad, &quot;it also has face tattoos, (audience laughs) &quot;It's so bad, ugh.&quot; I've been denied Do you know what that, I've seen a bird accidentally leave with a card, When I got denied, &quot;I'm so sorry, Like he was embarrassed for me, It was so bad, And so I like, they were like, &quot;then we'll let you buy a phone.&quot; I was like, &quot;with two tin cans and string, okay?&quot; That's so much money, My credit's really bad. It's like, So I'm like, Telling the debt collector like, &quot;Listen I'm not worried, And he's like, And I was like, &quot;Well I'm gonna go ahead and &quot;I'm gonna choose that option.&quot; And he was like, (audience laughs) It's like, &quot;there's a first time for everything, &quot;hang up now.&quot; &quot;Have a good day, I guess?&quot; (audience laughs) We were all very confused, it was a lot of first times So we both hang up the phone. I call my dentist, &quot;Hey, why'd you send me And the front desk lady answers it, And she's like, her name is Gertrude, (audience laughs) Everyone 100 years or older And I'm like, &quot;you've been out of She's so rude, (audience laughs) She's so rude.

(audience laughs) &quot;I'm not reading your letters, Gertrude. &quot;I'm not your sweetheart &quot;No one reads letters in 2017. &quot;Text me, anything else, (audience laughs) So she's like, &quot;I don't know what to tell you, And I was like, &quot;well I guess I have to You know, that happened, collection agencies call me all the time and I'm just like, And they're like, And then I'm like, and I hang up, you know? Well, it turns out, collection agencies do have another thing. They have one more thing. They can send someone to take you to small claims court But here's the thing about To serve them papers they have to get you (audience laughs) So it's like and I hear a knock at my door, and I answer the door and with a clipboard, &quot;Hey, are you Shayne Smith?&quot; And I was like, &quot;What, what's going on?&quot; And he's like, And I was like, &quot;never seen anyone by He was like, It's like, &quot;You're splitting hairs right now, &quot;What are you trying &quot;What's going on?&quot; And that's when I realized, with a clipboard and is my Facebook profile So he's seeing me see him with my stupid tattooed (audience laughs) looking right back up at him, I think I said that right and it's so awkward and &quot;Okay, well if you're not Shayne Smith, &quot;who are you?&quot; And it's like three p.m, I'm not ready I just said the first name I was like, &quot;I'm Bruce Wayne.&quot; (audience laughs) He was not impressed, In hindsight, So he's standing there that's when I realize, (audience laughs) Yeah, not good. And I was like... So I was like, And he was like, And I was like, And he was like, It's like, all right. So I'm pretty sure that's gonna There are no consequences. I don't know if you guys knew that. There are no consequences to debt. Like what are they gonna do, Can't. It's been closed, thank you. (audience applauds) It's been closed for like, (audience laughs) Oh, man. Not good with people. Saw a lady recently crying of the aisle at Target. Just in the middle, ugly crying, And I was like, So I'm in Target, She's crying so hard. I go right up to her and &quot;I think you mean to be (audience laughs) Nailed that interaction, yeah. (audience laughs) How 'bout don't cry I'm not paying an extra 15 cents for macaroni and cheese (audience laughs) Target is for champions, okay? (audience laughs) Ridiculous. (audience laughs) Ugh, so bad, My friends are so dumb. I know a lot of dumb people. There's a lot of dumb people This is the thing that I'm walking around, I see all these people gather They're all like around this tree. I'm like, And I walk up and I see one guy and &quot;Hey man, there's a cat stuck up &quot;Look at you with all your tattoos, &quot;you're not afraid of anything. &quot;Why don't you climb up and (audience laughs) &quot;Uh, that's not how tattoos work, (audience laughs) Yeah, yeah. You don't tattoo the fear out of people. (audience laughs) That's not a thing, No one's like, the tattoo artist is like, And the guy's like, &quot;but I don't care about (audience laughs) Silly. Cat's probably still up there, It's ridiculous. I'm afraid of tons of stuff. So many things, you know? Spiders, very top of the list of things I'm afraid of, right? Can I get some backup? (audience cheers) My idiot friends, &quot;Hey man, &quot;You're 90% more likely &quot;than a spider.&quot; Like, &quot;What are you &quot;I'm not afraid of spiders 'cause &quot;I think they're gonna kill me. &quot;They're creepy, &quot;or near me, you know? &quot;You're so dumb.&quot; You know what, about vending machines the way I'm worried about spiders start using spiders' tactics, okay? When I open my shower curtain there's a vending machine inside waiting to tip over I'll start worrying about it, all right. When I'm like playing video games and I have to tell my friend a vending machine on a web, you know? Then we'll start worrying. You imagine it crushes him, they're like, &quot;We're so, so sorry for your loss, Like, &quot;No, man.&quot; (audience laughs) So dumb, No one ever, how are you drawing that parallel? No one ever got killed they bought a Butterfinger from it and it wouldn't give it up, you know? That's never happened. How 'bout this statistic? 100% of people killed How 'bout that, you know? (audience laughs) I've been telling that joke I'm always afraid there's gonna be one person &quot;My husband was crushed And I'm gonna be like, &quot;but it was pretty funny though, right?&quot; (audience laughs) Spiders, so scary, eight-legged nightmare factories, The only thing worse than a spider, people who have spiders as pets. What is happening there, I hate it so much. And they always say dumb stuff, too. &quot;Spiders are more afraid of you False, not real, nope. No spider is more afraid of me No spider has ever caught me &quot;Well, I am sleeping in (audience laughs) That's never happened. (audience laughs) No spider has ever seriously considered burning its apartment down (audience laughs) That's never happened. No spider has ever been peeing in the middle of the night and it peed all over itself, okay? (audience laughs) That joke is so much more real (audience laughs) Oh, man. (audience laughs) This is my job now. This is my job but I used to have a day job working with disabled kids, and here's a real thing. You've never been insulted until a kid with autism insults you, I'll give you an example. Working with this kid, he's autistic. One of my favorite clients loved this guy, okay? He's like, &quot;I wanna go to the LEGO Store, I was like, So I'm driving him I'm having a terrible day. He could totally tell, It's the only thing that's not and... (audience laughs) So I'm having this terrible day, and he can tell and So this little kid, puts his hand on my shoulder &quot;Shayne, you're the coolest person I know.&quot; And then he looks out the window (sighs) &quot;I gotta meet more people.&quot; (audience laughs) Yeah, yeah, yeah. (audience laughs) And to this day, or if that was the autism, What? So I left him at the LEGO Store, you know, (audience laughs) All right you guys, then we're gonna get out of here, Good, thank you so much (audience applauds) All right, last story, Now this one's gonna get a little weird, I need you all to stay on board, the payoff is worth it, okay? I promise you. It's gonna get real weird, Now here's the deal. I, before I worked with kids, I was a gang member That's true and &quot;What? Earlier in the act, Well yeah, trust nobody, okay? Yeah, that's true, And when I tell people that, &quot;Whoa, were you a Crip And I'm like, You don't just go out it's a college or something, No one's like, &quot;but the Latin Kings are (audience laughs) You don't try to be in a gang, Usually you're in denial. People are like, And you're like, &quot;I work at Hot Topic, okay? &quot;There's no way, Tupac was never like, &quot;Oh no, and then left, you know? That's not how it works but eventually it sneaks up on you and you're telling your friend like, &quot;How cool is it we're making money &quot;Oh that's right, I'm a criminal now. It gets serious fast. Also, you guys, no one be awkward, It was just mostly like, violent crimes and robberies (audience laughs) So... During this time all right, I had a best friend. Now his name was Angry Anton, not a clever nickname, all right, just an angry guy, you know? Sometimes you meet people is Little John but you're like, It was not that, okay? It was just lazy nicknaming. He was just angry all the time. He was very scary, he was way more and I know a lot of you are like, how is it even possible to be more heavily tattooed than you? His entire face was completely covered, 100%. So he was basically like you pulled them to the side &quot;Draw me what you think And then they drew him and &quot;That is way correct. &quot;That's so correct, &quot;Where are your parents? &quot; He's so scary. Just a few stories to like, Once we were at a restaurant and in this particular restaurant where all their toiletries were, where you could just we were stealing them, okay. 'Cause you know, We're not gonna pay for them, so we have a backpack toilet paper and soap and A uniformed police officer sees us, says, &quot;What's up&quot; the police officer said, closed the door and (audience laughs) Yeah, yeah. Anyways, eventually I was like, And so when you get out, You have to cut ties with your friends, your family, everybody who has any tie okay, and move on and to help you move on before, so that you don't end up in prison. Sometimes the government lets you work with disabled kids, all right? Yeah, I know, So anyway. (audience laughs) It worked out for me but I feel like maybe not so much (audience laughs) I have this new job, Now, Anton was a bad person. Objectively, yes, he was a bad person. But also, He was a loyal friend, I couldn't get rid of him, in my life just a little bit. Just talking to him through emails, Trying to be there for him. So I'm moving on with this new life, it's like a year later and for disabled kids, okay? Now, working at this facility, I worked with a lot of Christian people. I worked with a lot of and they're all like really jazzed up All these upright good people and And they're just like, Knowing about my past, like, (audience laughs) &quot;Crazy, you know?&quot; So they're way jazzed up it's going pretty well. Now, at work Now, Mike had a weekend job working And one day Mike comes &quot;Hey, I work at this camp, all right, &quot;and we just barely got &quot;this new program we're doing. &quot;Now, these are kids that are going down &quot;the same path you went down &quot;They're making all the same mistakes and &quot;they're going down the same path. &quot;Would you like to come &quot;Maybe try and set 'em straight? &quot;Make 'em work out, &quot;just try and like, &quot;to do things?&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Yeah man, &quot;from going down the same road &quot;Anything to stop kids And he's like, &quot;All right, &quot;to bring with you to help, and I was like, Yeah, yeah. So it's the weekend and and he's like, &quot;with these kids isn't here, &quot;but the kids are in this barn.&quot; So he brings me and Anton All these kids are there, And he's like, &quot;I'm gonna go down the way and like, &quot;play guitar or do whatever, I don't know what he did, you know? And he's like, &quot;now you guys are gonna talk &quot;make 'em work out, And we were like, So he leaves and immediately, we start laying into these kids, okay? We are saying a lot of things We're yelling at them. One of them looks Anton &quot;if you make eye contact with me again, &quot;I will pluck yours out and Yeah, I was like, &quot;to go from there, you know?&quot; (audience laughs) You can't just open up with, That's too much, So we're just yelling at these kids. We're screaming, they're doing push-ups, It's like 2004, the puka shell necklace, (audience laughs) We're really giving it to him, And so eventually one he's like, And we're like, And Anton gets right in his face &quot;Do push-ups or consequences.&quot; And the kid says, So a couple minutes later, So hard. (audience laughs) And so all the other kids And they're just like, And I'm like, &quot;No way, you know? &quot;He's done this to himself.&quot; (audience laughs) So now everyone's doing push-ups. They're doing so many push-ups, okay? They're so scared and So much, there's crying a lot, these gangster kids are like, So much snot and &quot;We can see you crying, &quot;You're embarrassing.&quot; And that's when I'm like, and like, Bad kids don't have parents, So I'm like, So I'm like, &quot;with these kids?&quot; And he's like, (audience laughs) &quot;Cool.&quot; So I go down the way I'm like, &quot;Uh, nothing weird going on back there. (audience laughs) &quot;You want to tell me some more &quot;how they're going down the wrong path, &quot;the same path I went down?&quot; And he's like, &quot;that are like, &quot;Some of them fell asleep (audience laughs) &quot;Sluffing class.&quot; I'm like, (audience laughs) &quot;I'm gonna go now, yeah.&quot; Not gang members, (audience laughs) These kids are not, for the heat we are bringing, okay? I thought they were like, They're so soft, I'm so worried and Grown men shouldn't be alone with him. I'm running back to the barn, okay. I practically kick open the door. Inside the barn, (audience laughs) All the kids have formed a circle and two kids are fighting Thunderdome-style, hard crying. Anton is just egging 'em on, and I'm like, &quot;What is happening?&quot; All the kids in the corner. And he's like, And I'm like, And he's like, And I was like, &quot;Dude, we're going to jail for sure.&quot; (audience laughs) He's like, I'm like, &quot;They're just like, And he's like, I was like, &quot;We've said so many things, &quot;Pretty sure that happened, okay. &quot;I think I told another kid &quot;We've said so many things. &quot;We're going to prison, you know? &quot;We're going to prison for sure.&quot; And he's like, &quot;Don't worry about it, And I'm like, So he lines all the kids up &quot;Hey everyone, And they're like, (audience laughs) &quot;Please make it stop.&quot; And he's like, &quot;you're good, And he goes, &quot;If any of you tell anyone &quot;we will kill all of you.&quot; (audience laughs) Yep. (audience laughs) They're so scared. And so we're standing there, and we're like, So we left, I'm like, basically, I'm like, to come collect me, you know? Going to jail for real. Didn't happen, Work with Mike two shifts, It's been about 10 years now. Not one of those kids Yeah, yeah. Not one of those kids said about anything about us, I'd like to think It's been about 10 years. (audience laughs) They're very young, okay? It's been so long, and I'd like to think are like now graduating and they're just like, &quot;Yeah once I fell asleep in church, &quot;and I got my act together 'cause (audience laughs) &quot;One of 'em choked us, &quot;I never did anything wrong again.&quot; Thank you so much, everyone. (audience cheers) - Thank you! (audience cheering) Goodness gracious. How's it going everybody? (audience cheering) All right. You guys are wild, this is good. Let's get right into it, huh? It's 2019 and my look is less ideal than ever. (audience laughing) This is real! Here's the deal. I am a Jewish man but I look like an accountant for the Arian Brotherhood, (audience laughing) and I know that. (audience laughing) It's not, I didn't do it on purpose. But I do, I look like the nerdiest guy in the worst prison gang, it's a problem. (audience laughing) It's a serious problem. They're just like, &quot;He doesn't kill people &quot;he does read a lot though, he does.&quot; (audience laughing) Oh man, it's fine though. People are wild, they surprise me all the time with how wild they are. Recently, I was in a shoe store and I was just looking at shoes and a dude comes up to me and he goes, &quot;Oh, your face, that's crazy, &quot;I can't believe you did that!&quot; (audience laughing) And then he goes, &quot;Dude, so what do you, &quot;like a tattoo artist?&quot; And I was like, &quot;No man, &quot;I'm not good at art.&quot; And he goes, &quot;So just no job?&quot; (audience laughing) Like there's no other options! (audience laughing) So it's like, &quot;I can do work!&quot; He's like, &quot;Oh, so what do you do?&quot; And I was like, &quot;Well technically, no job, (audience laughing) &quot;but still, come on man.&quot; And then he goes, &quot;Well, if you need any help &quot;with anything, you let me know.&quot; I was like, &quot;You work here!&quot; (audience laughing) So disrespectful! (audience laughing) People are crazy disrespectful. I live in New York. Dudes, this is a thing that's happening often, dudes who wanna get my attention in public, they will combine with a think I look like with prison and yell it at me. The other day a guy was like, &quot;Hey you!&quot; And I was like. And he goes, &quot;Yeah you, &quot;Harry Potter but make it prison, &quot;come over here.&quot; (audience laughing) It's like, &quot;What? &quot;I'll come over but I didn't like that.&quot; (audience laughing) This is true, the other day I was sitting on the subway, I was sitting, minding my own business, this guys is scooting past me, he looked up at me and he stops and he goes, &quot;Hey, Jim from The Office &quot;did 10 years in prison, &quot;look at you.&quot; (audience laughing) (audience cheering) I was like, &quot;Did not like that one!&quot; I was like, &quot;That one was accurate. (audience laughing) Like, &quot;Come on man, &quot;I'm trying to grow my hair out, &quot;let me live my life!&quot; People on the train were laughing, he was killing! And he goes, &quot;Oh, so Pam left &quot;and you just snapped, huh?&quot; (audience laughing) He has follow-ups! (audience laughing) Come on! (audience laughing) Yeah, just going hard. I've been doing this, which I shouldn't do, I've been reading comments on my videos online. What a nightmare online is, just in general. This is real, I've been noticing this in comments, this is a new thing, a new trend I've been noticing, people, usually older people, will be annoyed withy my tattoos. Now, this is completely new, they will see me and then be like, &quot;Ugh, I remember when &quot;having your face &quot;or your throat tattooed meant &quot;that you were a criminal, &quot;meant that you were dangerous. &quot;Now it just means you're a hipster.&quot; And I'm must like, &quot;Are you disappointed &quot;I'm not a murder right now?&quot; (audience laughing) What is happening? (audience laughing) It's like you assume, firstly, you're making assumptions about who I am based on how I look. And then when I don't live up to them you're, and like it makes no sense. I'm furious, I cannot win with these people. And then, what's even crazier is that I happen to have gang tattoos on my face, I used to be a criminal when I was younger, not always the case, but in my case it is. Sometimes I will tell people that to stop them from being annoyed with my tattoos and then with so much confidence, they'll just tell me, &quot;No! &quot;No, you weren't a criminal. &quot;Listen, I've seen &quot;The Wire and Sons of Anarchy &quot;and you were not.&quot; (audience laughing) They're like experts now. (audience laughing) It's incredible, I spent the entire first part of my life only wanting respect from the scariest people you can imagine and now I'm on Facebook arguing with a 40-year-old woman named Joy. (audience laughing) She's just like, &quot;I bet you've never even &quot;stabbed anybody.&quot; &quot;What? (audience laughing) &quot;I've stabbed two people in my life!&quot; (audience laughing) She's just like, &quot;Not even three? (audience laughing) &quot;I bet they both survived.&quot; (audience laughing) Oh my gosh. (audience laughing) These are the same people who do stuff, they'll be like, &quot;Aren't you worried &quot;about how you're gonna &quot;look when you're older? &quot;Look at all that, &quot;aren't you worried about &quot;how you're gonna look &quot;when you're older?&quot; And it's just like, &quot;Okay, well, &quot;you're wearing dress socks &quot;with jean shorts, &quot;why don't you worry about &quot;how you look right now? &quot;How about that?&quot; (audience laughing) Yeah. (audience applauding) Ah man, let's... I've been traveling a lot, I've been all over. Recently I was in the south and I was at a Denny's. I was minding own business and I looked over and there's like a claw machine, like one of those giant claw machines you see, you know. And I was like, &quot;Ah man.&quot; And then there was a lady in front of the claw machine. Okay, it was a big one, where you win giant prizes, and she was crying. And I was like, &quot;Wow, that's seems like &quot;an over reaction &quot;to losing that game.&quot; (audience laughing) And my friends were like, &quot;No, you idiot, look.&quot; And I paid more attention and then she was crying because her toddler had crawled into the machine. (audience laughing) Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And he was stuck inside of it and she was like, &quot;Come out for mommy.&quot; And he was like, &quot;I live here now! (audience laughing) &quot;I have all the prizes. (audience laughing) &quot;Why would I ever leave?&quot; (audience laughing) So she's hysterical and she's just like, &quot;Someone call 911,&quot; like, &quot;Someone call the police.&quot; And I'm just like, &quot;Don't waste public resources, lady, &quot;now is your time, &quot;win him back, let's go!&quot; (audience laughing) Right! (audience laughing) &quot;The stakes have never been higher, &quot;let's do it!&quot; (audience laughing) I was just like, &quot;Listen, I have $5, I can claw your baby. &quot;Let me try, I can get him! &quot;I can get him.&quot; She did not think it was as funny as you guys did. (audience laughing) So, they called the police or whatever and they brought the fire department and they took the machine apart and got the kid out. And she was very snooty about the whole thing. But I was like, &quot;How funny would that have been &quot;if just some big, &quot;Italian firefighter showed up?&quot; And she was like, &quot;What are you gonna use &quot;the Jaws of Life &quot;to save my baby?&quot; And he's like, &quot;I have ten ones, let's do it!&quot; (audience laughing) Cut to 40 minutes later, he's like, &quot;I'm out of money, &quot;I am so sorry for your loss. (audience laughing) &quot;Will you take a life size &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog instead?&quot; (audience laughing) It's good to be back here in the West, I live in New York now, I came back here for this and to visit my family often. It's also, there's different challenges being here than in the city. Like for instance, recently while I was here, I hit a deer with my car. Yeah, but it's not what you guys think, okay. I did it completely on purpose, now... (audience laughing) How that happened was, I was driving, minding my own business and I'm going down the street and I looked over and I saw a dog and a deer in a parking lot together, okay. I was like, &quot;They're friends, like in Disney.&quot; (audience laughing) But I was wrong, they were not friends, they were enemies and they were fighting pretty hard, okay. All right, I don't, and I didn't even know, the deer was hooving the dog, I didn't even know they did that, all right. And the dog hated it so the dog goes running away from the deer to escape and the dog comes running across the street I'm driving down and the deer comes chasing after the dog and I had a decision to make. (audience laughing) Yeah. (audience laughing) Listen, it was an Australian shepherd, okay, it's crunch time! (audience laughing) I hit that deer so hard with my car. (audience laughing) I swerved and everything. Listen, I hit that deer like my stepdad was riding it. Do you understand? (audience laughing) (audience applauding) That is what I like, a crowd that is not a fan of my stepfather! (audience laughing) Nobody likes you Joe! (audience laughing) I shouldn't use his real name but whatever. (audience laughing) So, (audience laughing) by the way, I should not say this but you guys seem cool, so I'm gonna say it anyway. (audience laughing) Feels so good to hit something that big with your car, it was awesome! (audience laughing) Yes! (audience laughing) Listen, I didn't want to have to do it but if I'm gonna do it, it might as well be cool. (audience laughing) I don't know it felt cool to hit something that big, I get what old people are up to in farmer's markets, I get it. (audience laughing) Like, I understand, now when I'm on the couch and I'm watching the news and they're like, &quot;An elderly gentleman &quot;ran over six people &quot;and slammed his car &quot;into Best Buy today.&quot; I'm just sitting there like, &quot;Live your best life grandpa, &quot;get in there. (audience laughing) &quot;Yeah, you didn't fight in World War II &quot;not to hit someone with your car, &quot;get it.&quot; (audience laughing) So, listen I feel some of you in the audience being worried about the deer and that's fair but don't be, okay. The deer is fine, I drive a 2001 Saturn, the deer is fine, okay. (audience laughing) Yeah. (audience laughing) It seems like you guys might know a thing or two about cars, that is not a good car. (audience laughing) Yeah, my car is so bad that when I bought it I parked it on the street and that night I assume some kids spray painted the word &quot;Wow&quot; on the side of it, (audience laughing) and I did not care, okay. (audience laughing) Yeah so I'm in my 2001 Saturn, the dog runs past, the deer is coming, I slam on the gas, I gave it everything I had. All that happened, okay, was the deer rolled up onto the side of my hood on its side, rolled back onto it's hooves, and then just looked at me like, &quot;What was that about, man?&quot; (audience laughing) And I'm just in my car awkward like, &quot;I'm trying to kill you!&quot; (audience laughing) The deer's just like, &quot;I don't need this.&quot; And it left to go do deer stuff or whatever. (audience laughing) So the deer is gone. I'm sitting in my car, I can't believe this just happened and I realized the dog is nowhere to be found. The dog escaped, yes, I'm an American hero. (audience cheering) I deserve this! (audience cheering) I know, it's like the troops, then me, then firefighters. (audience laughing) I'm feeling very good. (audience laughing) This is literally the most onboard anyone has ever been (audience laughing) with that premise. (audience laughing) I used to put myself above the troops, even as a joke, people were like, &quot;Pull it back, &quot;you gotta be behind.&quot; (audience laughing) So, I'm feeling good, I'm in the street, I just hit a deer with my car, I'm a good person. I'm feeling great. (audience laughing) I'm jazzed up, I'm like pumped up on adrenaline, I just can't believe it happened, I'm like dancing in my car, I was like, &quot;Ah, that was crazy!&quot; And I look over and I see a family, (audience laughing) they're wearing their Sunday best, like a mom and a dad. They're pushing a baby stroller down the sidewalk. And I was like (gasping), they probably saw everything. They definitely wanna talk to me. (audience laughing) So I do a U-turn, (audience laughing) I pull up to them. Have you ever seen a guy pick up a baby stroller to get away from you faster? (audience laughing) Yeah. (audience laughing) Yeah! (audience laughing) I'm just in my car like, &quot;What is this guy's problem?&quot; And then I realize, &quot;Oh no, they have no context for what just happened. (audience laughing) They probably didn't even see the dog! They just see some guy in the middle of the city with his face covered in tattoos, driving the world's worst car, just clobber a deer for no reason. (audience laughing) Then, that guy sits in the street and thinks about it for a while, (audience laughing) spots your family, (audience laughing) does a U-turn, (audience laughing) revealing the fact that he has the word &quot;Wow&quot; spray painted (audience laughing) on the side of his car, (audience laughing) struggles to get his window down 'cause he drives a 2001 Saturn. And then he looks out at your wife and kid and just goes, &quot;I'm a hero!&quot; (audience laughing) He left so fast. (audience laughing) He left his wife, he did not care, (audience laughing) hustling. (audience laughing) Oh man. (audience laughing) I've been traveling a ton this year for comedy, which has been great. I went to two places in particular, I went to Austin and Portland. Both places-- (audience clapping) No, hold on. (audience laughing) Either way you're wrong, both... (audience laughing) If you've seen me before and I bring up a place, I will say nothing good about that place. (audience laughing) I'm not here to be like, &quot;They were great and moving on.&quot; No, so I went to Austin and Portland and they're not so bad but here is a thing, Austin and Portland, both cities where their whole motto is &quot;Keep It Weird&quot; and they're, &quot;We're weird, ugh.&quot; And I showed and like I'm a weird guy. I love weird stuff, I cannot wait to see what I'm gonna see. Nothing weird at all, okay. I'm talking to people like, &quot;When does the weird happen?&quot; And they're like, &quot;It's around.&quot; It wasn't. (audience laughing) There's nothing weird happening in either of those places. I was like, &quot;You guys have to, &quot;the bar has to be higher.&quot; I live in New York, once on the subway I saw a guy, this is real, only wearing the top half of a SpongeBob costume, okay. (audience laughing) Yeah, and what, what was he doing you ask? He was wrestling-- - [Audience Member] Oh! - Another man, okay. Who clearly didn't know him. (audience laughing) That guy he was wrestling was just yelling out over and over again, he goes, &quot;Sponge Bill, no!&quot; (audience laughing) Yeah. (audience laughing) But no one on the train was helping, (audience laughing) there's everyone watching like he seems like he has it under control. (audience laughing) So if you're gonna be weird, you gotta step it up. Also, how dare Austin and Portland, &quot;Keep It Weird&quot; when, how dare they act like they're weird when they know Florida exists. (audience laughing) Yeah, it is just out there doing what Florida does. (audience laughing) Last time I was in Florida, this is real, by the way, this is Googleable information after the show. I'm in Florida, I'm walking past a newspaper stand, I look into the stand, the headline on the newspaper reads, &quot;Local man robs Wendy's with aligator.&quot; (audience laughing) &quot;What did you just say to me?&quot; I read it, I still said that out loud, it was incredible! And also, oh yeah, that's all you wanna say, you don't wanna add any more to that? Like, I don't know, maybe tell us if the aligator was an accomplice or a weapon, how about that? (audience laughing) For real. (audience laughing) Did this guy rob a Wendy's with an aligator or did this guy rob a Wendy's with an aligator? (audience laughing) There's a huge difference. (audience laughing) Did he start a gang with an aligator, throw a bandana on it? (audience laughing) He's like, &quot;We're the aligator boys now. (audience laughing) Let's get to a Wendy's and make this official. (audience laughing) No. So, this is happening, I bought the paper and I read the article and this is real, he used the aligator as a weapon, okay. And when I read that I was like, &quot;Did he at least hold it like a gun?&quot; (audience laughing) Right? He didn't, he threw it (audience laughing) through a drive-thru window! (audience laughing) Yep! (audience laughing) Didn't see that one coming, did ya? (audience laughing) You know who else didn't? The lady (audience laughing) at the drive-thru! (audience laughing) So many things have to happen before you can even throw an aligator. (audience laughing) You have to find it in the wild! (audience laughing) Also, by the way, how horrible is Florida that there is just alligators available to you! (audience laughing) What was even his qualifying material? Was he looking for a specific type? Or are you just the first one he saw, he was like, &quot;This is the one&quot; and he took it, that was it? (audience laughing) So this is real, this happened, in Florida, a place connected to the United States (audience laughing) where we are all living currently! (audience laughing) A grown man, with a driver's license (audience laughing) found an aligator that day. He didn't even build a relationship with it. (audience laughing) He takes this new aligator and he seat belts it into the backseat of his car. (audience laughing) I assume. (audience laughing) I just have no idea how else you keep it from getting into the front seat and biting you, right. (audience laughing) I don't, (audience laughing) I don't know if you guys know anything about alligators but they kinda just do whatever they want. (audience laughing) So he seat belts this dinosaur into the back seat (audience laughing) and then he gets into the front seat and he's like, &quot;Ugh, I gotta make some money today.&quot; (audience laughing) Staring at the wheel, &quot;Ah, I could get a job,&quot; and he goes, &quot;No, no time. (audience laughing) &quot;Spent most my day &quot;on that aligator thing,&quot; (audience laughing) Projects. (audience laughing) (exhaling loudly) &quot;I could rob someone.&quot; He goes, &quot;I could rob a place, &quot;'cause places have more &quot;money than someones. (audience laughing) &quot;Rob a bank,&quot; and he goes, &quot;No, no, &quot;they'll be expecting that.&quot; (audience laughing) He's thinking about it and then he thought, he comes to the conclusion, Wendy's. (audience laughing) They have money and chili, that's the place. (audience laughing) So he drives his new aligator to Wendy's, okay, pulls up to the drive-thru, and the lady at the drive-thru is like, &quot;Hello, how can I help you today?&quot; And he goes, &quot;Give me all the money.&quot; And she just goes, looks right at him and goes, &quot;Uh, no! (audience laughing) &quot;You didn't even come inside? (audience laughing) &quot;You failed at this robbery.&quot; And the dude is so mad and he goes, &quot;Give me the money in the register &quot;or I'll kill you!&quot; And she's from Florida so she's not afraid of death or whatever. (audience laughing) She looks down at him and she's like, &quot;No, &quot;if you had a gun you would of &quot;showed it to me already, &quot;I call your bluff. &quot;Get outta here crazy guy, goo, go, go!&quot; And he's seething mad at this point, furious. And he's like, you know what, &quot;I don't have a gun &quot;but hold on.&quot; (audience laughing) And then he palmed an aligator (audience laughing) through the drive-thru window! (audience laughing) Yup! (audience laughing) He skipped so many steps in that robbery. (audience laughing) If he had a list of things he was supposed to do he would of thrown the aligator, looked down, and just been like, &quot;Oh no! (audience laughing) &quot;I was supposed to threaten her &quot;with the aligator first.&quot; (audience laughing) By the way, can you imagine being her? Just telling this guy off and he's like, &quot;You know what, I don't have a gun.&quot; And you're like, &quot;Wow, nailed it, &quot;really doing it today.&quot; And then he leans back and starts unbuckling the world's ugliest toddler. (audience laughing) Like &quot;Ugh, hey, &quot;someone come and see, this is wild.&quot; And then you look back and an aligator is flying. (audience laughing) Imagine being the car behind him! (audience laughing) Just, sitting there with your girlfriend, like, &quot;What takes so long &quot;to make burgers here?&quot; (audience laughing) She's on her phone, you're like, &quot;Do you even care?&quot; You look back from her and then an aligator soars, whoop, from window to window! (audience laughing) &quot;Honey, get off your phone, &quot;they're throwing alligators &quot;into Wendy's! (audience laughing) &quot;This guy is crazy!&quot; (audience laughing) She's on her phone like, &quot;That doesn't make sense, &quot;they don't even serve alligators here.&quot; (audience laughing) &quot;What, why am I with you?&quot; (audience laughing) So, this dude is sitting there, awkwardly, with no more alligators left to play in the robbery. (audience laughing) Probably thinking to himself, &quot;Ugh, you think if I ask &quot;for my aligator back?&quot; (audience laughing) Such a bad idea to throw it, he didn't even put a fanny pack on it like maybe get some money while you're in there, I don't know. (audience laughing) So, (audience laughing) he drives off. (audience laughing) Yeah, and he gets arrested immediately. (audience laughing) He didn't even wear a mask. (audience laughing) Yeah, he was like, &quot;I'm in Florida, &quot;people throw alligators, &quot;I'll probably get lost in the shuffle.&quot; (audience laughing) Um no, he didn't. They remembered him, they arrested him pretty hard afterwards. The end of the article, this is true, it goes, &quot;No one was injured, &quot;the aligator was safely released &quot;back into the wild.&quot; And the very end of the article it read, &quot;No drug involvement suspected.&quot; (audience laughing) Oh yeah, Florida? That was your sober plan? (audience laughing) What does the non-sober plan look like? (audience laughing) Do you ride a horse and the aligator throws you? (audience laughing) What happens? (audience laughing) I make fun of aligator guy like I have my life together, but I don't. (audience laughing) There's no easy way to say this but my life is not, it's not together. My personal life isn't as good as you think it might be. And some of you are like, &quot;Shane, &quot;your life has to be going well, &quot;look at you on stage.&quot; Yeah, I'm living my dreams and that's nice but also my personal life, tatters. Let me tell you, okay, there's no easy way to say this so I'm just gonna open up and say it, okay. I am 32-years-old and I pooped my pants recently, okay. (audience laughing) Yep, not supposed to do that! (audience laughing) Uh. (audience laughing) I don't like the way some of you are laughing, by the way. If feel like you guys, just to clarify, I didn't just do it like, I wasn't just like watching Batman like &quot;Dah, this movie is good, &quot;I don't think I'm gonna make it.&quot; I didn't poop my pants freestyle for the love of the game. (audience laughing) I had a reason. (audience laughing) Here's what happened, okay. I had food poisoning. Yeah, it could happen to anybody. I had food poisoning, I was parallel parking my car, (audience laughing) that's not a part of this, that's mostly a humble brag but I can parallel park my car. So, I'm parking my car, I had food poisoning and I coughed. (audience laughing) Yep, and it happened to me. (audience laughing) It happened, I pooped my pants. Listen, you know how sometimes you fart and you're like, &quot;That was pretty gross, but I'm okay.&quot; (audience laughing) Not that one! (audience laughing) Nope! I pooped my pants so fast and so hard, it was like somebody else pooped my pants. (audience laughing) It was incredible. (audience laughing) By the way, didn't even know that was one of the options when you cough. (audience laughing) What, that can happen? (audience laughing) I've been pooping my pants for 32 years. Did I say pooping my pants? I meant coughing. (audience applauding) Cut that one, cut that in post, everybody. (audience laughing) We're going to cut that one out, okay. (audience laughing) Listen, you guys don't know my life. (audience laughing) I've been coughing for 32 years. (audience laughing) Not once ever, after cough for 32 years have I ever been like (coughing), &quot;Whoa! (audience laughing) &quot;What was that?&quot; One of my friends was like, &quot;What just happened?&quot; I was like, &quot;I coughed, &quot;I almost pooped my pants.&quot; He's like, &quot;Yeah, that can happen, &quot;gotta watch out for those.&quot; Not once ever! (audience laughing) Like, the cough waited 32 years and then betrayed me. (audience laughing) Like, once I was in ninth grade and I was giving talk in front of the class and I coughed and my body was like, &quot;Do we do it now?&quot; (audience laughing) And then puberty was like, &quot;No, we will embarrass him. (audience laughing) &quot;You, hold back, wait 20 years, &quot;then take him out, &quot;right before he has to do comedy.&quot; (audience laughing) Yeah, I was parking at a comedy club! (audience laughing) It was worse case, so I get out of my car, I can't get back into it, it's not one of those. (audience laughing) I was like, &quot;What do I, what do I do?&quot; And I was like, my first plan was to buy the pants off of a homeless guy. (audience laughing) But they are never there when you need them, the homeless. (audience laughing) My second plan was to buy the shirt off of a guy wearing two shirts. But here's the thing, if you try and buy the shirt off of a guy wearing two shirts and you tell him you need it 'cause you pooped your pants, he will run from you, so. (audience laughing) I was gonna wear it like a, I don't know what I thought, anyway. So I look across the street and there's like a mall. And I was like, I gotta get over there, so I waddle over. You know, yeah, it's a shameful walk. People can tell, they can. A kid tries to talk to me and his dad is like, &quot;Get away from him!&quot; And this kid is like, &quot;Because of how he looks?&quot; And he's like, &quot;No, other things, go! (audience laughing) &quot;Get away.&quot; (audience laughing) So, I get into the first clothing store I can get into and the guy working there is like, &quot;Hello, how can we help you today?&quot; I was like, &quot;Come here, &quot;come here right now.&quot; And he's like, &quot;Oh, what's going on, what is it?&quot; And I was like, &quot;Here's the deal man, &quot;I have fully pooped my pants.&quot; (audience laughing) And he just goes, &quot;Excuse me!&quot; I was like, &quot;Am I stuttering right now? &quot;Daniel, okay! (audience laughing) &quot;I need you on team me right, &quot;there is no time. &quot;Do they not train you for this?&quot; (audience laughing) He's like, &quot;What do I do?&quot; I was like, &quot;Go get me a pair of jeans this second.&quot; So he runs off and he comes back and he goes, &quot;I have mediums and I have larges.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Give me the mediums!&quot; And he looks right at me and he goes, &quot;Do you wanna try those on?&quot; (audience laughing) I said, &quot;Do you think &quot;this is a game Daniel?&quot; (audience laughing) &quot;I need the key &quot;to your employee bathroom &quot;and an undisclosed &quot;amount of time, man. &quot;How many times you gonna &quot;make me say it, &quot;I have pooped my pants!&quot; (audience laughing) In a weird twist of fate, I am wearing those pants currently. (audience applauding) Thank you so much everyone, have a great night! (audience cheering)
