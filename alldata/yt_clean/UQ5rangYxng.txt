JUDY WOODRUFF: Fifty years ago this week, off, and then landed on the moon a few days Much of the attention, and especially during Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, the astronauts and efforts of their command module pilot too. As Miles O'Brien tells us, Collins had a perspective to the mission. His profile is the focus of tonight's Leading MILES O'BRIEN: For a man spun from the rarest humble and self-deprecating. How much of what happened to you was luck, MICHAEL COLLINS, Former NASA Astronaut: Ooh, I think... MILES O'BRIEN: Or do you believe in luck? That's another question. MICHAEL COLLINS: Ardently, I believe in luck. Luck should be put on my gravestone. MILES O'BRIEN: Sure, he and his Apollo 11 were all born in the same year, 1930. MICHAEL COLLINS: We just wandered by at exactly And that is a consummate example of luck, I am a big believer in luck. MILES O'BRIEN: But, of course, they really No, they were marching with a warrior's purpose. After all, luck favors the well-prepared. In 1963, he was a test pilot, driven to go in its third class of astronauts. His first mission? Gemini 10 in 1966. The Gemini missions were primarily focused the devilishly complex process of bringing It consumed the time and talent of NASA's But what about space-walking? MICHAEL COLLINS: Well, you just kind of go And we really had not thought through just MILES O'BRIEN: And he had two space walks MICHAEL COLLINS: One of the consequences of was, I found myself outside, no handholds went ass over teakettle out into the unknown, MILES O'BRIEN: It wasn't pretty, but he pulled The worst part for us, during the gyrations, his priceless selfies into the void. Collins became the astronaut specialist on Ironically, there were a few occasions when the Apollo command module simulator gave him MICHAEL COLLINS: I was wedged in below one I couldn't really move. I was almost trapped. MILES O'BRIEN: Something like that, you probably right? MICHAEL COLLINS: That is correct. I never confessed that to anybody at that I was afraid I would be grounded. MILES O'BRIEN: It's the worst word a pilot Fortunately, he never felt the panic in space. He says he never really felt scared. But he was worried pretty much the whole time. MICHAEL COLLINS: I think of a flight to the of events. Any one of those links breaks, everything There are so many things that can go wrong. The machinery is compact, but complex, extremely You can never relax -- or at least I could I could never say, things are going well. That was almost a jinx to say that things I might think that in the back of my mind, a little bit worried about the next little MILES O'BRIEN: When Neil Armstrong and Buzz their way toward their historic landing on MAN: Roger. Eagle is undocked. MAN: Roger. How does it look? MAN: The Eagle has wings. MILES O'BRIEN: ... Collins remained in the not the best seat on this mission, but not MICHAEL COLLINS: I think you have got a fine the fact you're upside down. MILES O'BRIEN: Surprisingly, he didn't worry . MAN: The Eagle has landed. MILES O'BRIEN: But, rather, whether they could The engine to propel them off the lunar surface of redundant systems. MICHAEL COLLINS: It was a solitary, single, That chamber either ignited properly and got If it didn't, Neil and Buzz were dead on the So, that was very critical worry point for MILES O'BRIEN: Did you guys talk about the home alone? Did that ever come up? MICHAEL COLLINS: It wasn't something I wanted &quot;Hey, Neil, suppose you are stranded forever Would you mind terribly if I just sort of I mean, it wasn't the kind of thing one talked It was there. MILES O'BRIEN: There was no need to have that MICHAEL COLLINS: Exactly. MILES O'BRIEN: Coming home alone, what would MICHAEL COLLINS: Well, it would have been I mean, I don't -- I hate to think about it. MAN: Tranquility Base Houston, you're cleared MAN: Roger. Understand. We are number one on the runway. MAN: Beautiful. Very smooth. Very quiet ride. MILES O'BRIEN: On their ride back home, they The moon was their destination, but, for Collins, MICHAEL COLLINS: All right, I have got the The moon was nothing compared to my view of It was it. It was the main chance. I would look out the window, and there would You know, you could obscure it with your thumb. But every time you put it away somewhere, It wanted you to look at it. It wanted to be seen. It was gorgeous. It was tiny, shiny, the blue of the oceans, rust color that we call continents. It just glowed. Having gone out 240,000 miles and seeing it a much greater urge to do something to protect MILES O'BRIEN: His memoir, &quot;Carrying the Fire,&quot; by astronauts are judged, right stuff meets He is the poet laureate the Apollo astronauts, a lack of poetry at a historic moment. In December 1968, he was the astronaut in of Apollo 8, the first voyage to orbit the It was his job to give mission commander Frank would give them enough velocity to escape In NASA parlance, it was called trans-lunar It was a historic first. MICHAEL COLLINS: So, I thought, when this will certainly send a message. The president will come. Sinatra will sing. There will be some acknowledgment of it. And in the meantime, of course, it's up to And we're both right up there. We are going to handle this thing properly. So, I went first. I said: Apollo 8, you are go for TLI. Over. And Frank rose to the occasion. And he said: FRANK BORMAN, NASA Astronaut: Roger. Understand. We are go for TLI. MICHAEL COLLINS: That was it. That was it. That was the whole thing. That was ridiculous. (LAUGHTER) MICHAEL COLLINS: I mean, what do we have all MILES O'BRIEN: If you had to do that one over, (LAUGHTER) MICHAEL COLLINS: I don't know. I don't know. I have to think that one over. MILES O'BRIEN: A few weeks later, I interviewed New York City. He was ready. Here's your moment for a do-over. What would you say if you could do it again? MICHAEL COLLINS: Uh-oh. (LAUGHTER) MICHAEL COLLINS: Well, I would abide by the more than I think eight words in a row, and, (LAUGHTER) MICHAEL COLLINS: But, under those conditions, Go.&quot; (LAUGHTER) MILES O'BRIEN: Yes. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) MILES O'BRIEN: Fifty years ago, the moon became Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins were the trio thanks to the concerted effort of more than of American taxpayers. When it was done, inhabitants in all corners for not just one country, but for humanity NEIL ARMSTRONG, NASA Astronaut: That's one MILES O'BRIEN: For the &quot;PBS NewsHour,&quot; I'm
