&gt;&gt; Western pop music has always been influenced by artists and styles from around the world. A new book aims to give those varied influences all of them their due. Special correspondent -- has our story as part of our arts and culture series canvas. &gt;&gt; A literary event in New York City, at the French consulate's villa where the topic is musical influences. &gt;&gt; I'd grown up listening to the beatles. Things like that and then I realized much later, oh, that is a Cuban rhythm. &gt;&gt; That is David Byrne talking -- and the gentleman to his right. &gt;&gt; One way of looking at the history of American music is a series of shocks. &gt;&gt; His name is Joe Boyd and he has a name of -- a way of showing up where history was made. He was in Paris when in 1964 film captured a tour introducing blues artist to Europe. &gt;&gt; Sonny Terry. &gt;&gt; I'm a stranger &gt;&gt; That is him in the hat and sunglasses while Bob Dylan is rehearsing &quot;Like a rolling stone.&quot; Boyd would become a producer with extraordinary -- from the psychedelia of pink Floyd. To the pensive folk of Nick drake. To the jazzy pop of Maria moldor. Nowadays, he's a writer. His book as this would be a look at how salons the world over have influence the pop music of the west. &gt;&gt; Salsa, reggae, Bulgarian music. &gt;&gt; The western temperate scale was not absolute. &gt;&gt; From Brazil to Pakistan, Jamaica to South Africa and more Boyd probes the foundations of the familiar. For example, you might know Robbie Schenker a highlight of the film pop festival. He taught the sitar to beatle George Harrison but Boyd gives us his older brother. &gt;&gt; Udai was at this incredible looking guy. And he formed an advanced company and little Robbie, became a star dancer. He occasionally would pick up the sitar and start playing. &gt;&gt; But it was teacher Kahn who got Ravi to be serious. &gt;&gt; He said you really talented kid and you are throwing it away if you're just practicing once in a while. Come and live with me. Ravi turned out to be the ideal ambassador for Indian music. &gt;&gt; He would go on to influence the giants from a violinist to John culturing. &gt;&gt; Coltraine felt liberated by Indian music. Exploring this new world of open tune. With the cornea's most western song you can possibly have. &gt;&gt; Corny to some. &quot;My favorite things&quot; -- he applied what he learned from it india. &gt;&gt; If you listen to that crazy guitar solo, it is Ravi shankar meets John culturing. &gt;&gt; His book shows how music takes is a-- a circuitous path. As you slide a metal bar across the neck. It's variations including Steele guitar would become staples in country and blues but the slide style also made its way to India by way of bm bott. &gt;&gt; He was a student of Ravi's. He discovered hawaiian guitar and thought, hmm. &gt;&gt; In his work, you can your strains of what came before but the sound is still unmistakably his own. To create it, he would develop an instrument played on his lap of the slide Barbara have an additional string like a sitar. &gt;&gt; The Indian classical music establishment did not like it at all. But it became very popular. And now he is a big star in India. &gt;&gt; The mainstream culture of the west. &gt;&gt; And they give-and-take of cultural transmission, some of his stories invol a lot more take than give. Pick the case of south African -- Linda, who would come from the countryside to johannesburg where he would record the 1939 hit embube. and there's a moment where he starts improvising. Da da da &gt;&gt; And with that improvisation, the famous melody was born. The record became huge in south Africa. &gt;&gt; The weavers misheard the term, which means &quot;You are a lion&quot; as weemaway in 1951. Ten years later a version went all the way toto number one. There was another hit version in the 1970's and another in the 1980's. &gt;&gt; In the jungle, the lion sleeps tonight &gt;&gt; The Lio sleeps tonight &gt;&gt; The amount of money generated was astronomical. He was dead. &gt;&gt; A 2006 summit would pay some royalties to his heirs, but more dispute would follow. &gt;&gt; That is one of the worst examples of influences across culture that does not get paid for correctly. That happens a lot, but there are lots of different ways to Mo ve across cultural connections. &gt;&gt; We're all connected in the great thing is, when anyone tries to replicate the music of another, it always -- they always fail but they very often fail in a wonderful way. Something wonderful comes out of the act of emulation. &gt;&gt; For the pbs news hour, I am Cassano in New York City -- Tom cashado in New York City.
