[Ja] Welcome to Sad Boyz, a podcast [Ja] I said it very angry today. - I'm Jarvis. [Ja] And today we're joined by, um-- [Ja] We're joined by two very and Brian David Gilbert-- [Jo] Gibler! [Ify] I know exactly who you [BDG] We're gonna be talking [Bri] Jordan is not going to [Ja] I was gonna make a joke about this, and you know when you - [Ja] Anyway, this is Brian Gibler now. [Ify] Which is funny, because when you kinda had a Kibler thing going. - [Ify] Now you cut it. But it looks good! [Ja] Uh, we played [Ja] He doesn't know it. [Ja] We added each other back. &quot;Hey, man. I like your streams.&quot; - [Bri] Beautiful. [Ify] I'll connect y'all, 'cause you should [Ja] Oh, yeah, I'm down. - [Ja] Before we get into Magic talk... - [Jo] How's everybody doing? - [Ify] Ooh. Yeah, I'm doing really well. [Bri] Mostly because of which I had to bring [Ja] We've all collectively joined a cult. [Bri] It was fast, I think. [Ify] It was everything as soon as I did it, [Ify] I remember the timing of it all, because I went to PAX East, and my friend Anica Seelie, uh, I was playing with their deck, and they were like, and then I beat them with it. [Ify] I was like, &quot;Oh, yeah. It's just more complicated,&quot; [Ify] And then I got the bug, - [Bri] Well, I made fun of Ify. [Bri] That was the thing. I was there for a single day, and like, I am not great at conventions, but Ify is. [Bri] Ify lives for the [Bri] So I'm following and watching him get upsold like where he's like, &quot;I'll just and, &quot;I should get a playmat too,&quot; &quot;Also, if I'm thinking about it, I really [Bri] I watched you drop like $100 to $200 before we had our PAX thing. [Bri] And I came home like, I watched Ify spend [Bri] And at that same time, &quot;Well, they do have and that's all Karen needs [Bri] She's like, &quot;If I buy [Bri] And I was like, [Jo] It's a classic adult nerd dilemma, where really, we can pretend - but it's a little bit fun. - [Jo] But also, we like the thing. - [Ify] Yes. - [Jo] Oh, loser, dude! - because I'll have-- - [Ify] Well, you say that, but-- but I'm SAYING it about Warhammer. [Bri] I mean it about Warhammer. [Ify] There's a Lord of the Rings [Bri] I'm not telling Karen about it, - and she's not allowed to watch this. [Ja] We scramble it in a - [Ify] Yeah. [Ify] Ooh! OK, see? - [Ja] Brian and I were in the aisle-- - [Jo] That's true. That and Tekken. [Ify] Yeah, that and when, um... - 'cause Rahul Kohli is-- [Ify] And yeah, I realize, 'cause I was like, &quot;Oh, this is like [Ify] Like, &quot;This is their shit.&quot; [Jo] It's fantasy to imagine that - [Ify] Yeah! [Jo] It's just a lot of &quot;And then we'd put ourself in an engine, and set ourselves on fire - but it's pretty cool.&quot; [Ja] Brian and I were in the in the Warhammer section, going, &quot;Can you believe people do this?&quot; - [Bri] &quot;Come on!&quot; - [Ja] Henry Cavill, ripped. [Ify] It's so funny, 'cause Brian... specifically is just so close, like that Cheeto holding a door closed, because the jump from - [Ja] Are you building Gundams? - [Ja] Here's the thing. [Bri] I'm within spitting distance, [Bri] Like, look, I accept - [Bri] It's taken a month to be obsessed. you know, goal with us and Um, Actually to where I can force you &quot;OK, but if we do get the international Um, Actually tour, you gotta paint minis with me.&quot; [Jo] We want you to be dizzy from the [Ja] What's funny is but I've never painted them. - [Jo] Nerd, dude. [Ja] No, just 'cause, uh... [Ja] I was in Japan and I bought a model, and I built the model, but then 'cause I was like, &quot;Oh, it's just purple.&quot; [Ify] It's so funny, 'cause painting and now I'm like, &quot;Ooh, I do need to go back and, like, build some Gunpla and paint it.&quot; [Ify] But I have such a huge backlog that it's keeping me. [Ja] Yeah, I have a backlog [Ify] That's why I think because it's easy to just pop and go. [Ify] But with Warhammer, [Ify] He was like, &quot;We're [Ify] I was like, &quot;Oh, I haven't [Ify] So I'm speed-painting [Bri] That's a lot more effort. [Bri] And I appreciate that that's [Bri] Like, the thing that was not just that I love deck-building, [Bri] I was saying the was that I had all the it just hadn't expressed itself [Bri] The fact that I can like we can just play Magic as opposed to, once again, having another - to paint miniatures-- [Bri] That's the hard part [Bri] It does cut any-- [Bri] Like, I don't need [Bri] I'm very capable [Bri] I don't need anything else. - and that's a good thing. [Jo] &quot;Oh, I'm good, actually. I'm fine.&quot; [Ja] That was what got me back into it, 'cause when I was a kid, I used to go to Pokemon events and when I was in high school I would [Ja] And so I also had and all of the muscle memory and then I just stopped because I didn't and I was just focusing on [Ja] And because I already, one, two, like, was just waiting for [Ja] Oh, Commander being where you could just hang out was such an easy on-ramp back into it. [Ja] But I do think I only wanna - because... [Ja] I don't know what y'all's but sometimes you play against people who are not fun to play. - [Ify] Oh, yeah. [Jo] I mean, that's the thing about... [Jo] Fighting games, historically, because I like figuring out [Jo] But then, ever which is where the majority at least my one for that, it has only become picking up the - and that is very unsatisfying. [Jo] Not only are you going to be bad, [Jo] It's never a tense situation [Jo] You're just way worse or way better. [Jo] But it also lacks the - of opening the booster pack, or even... [Jo] I was in my Marvel Snap [Ja] Uh, the connection is... [Ja] I played a lot of Hearthstone. [Ja] And then the lead who's also a Magic player, Ben Brode, moved over to, uh, moved over to create Second Dinner. [Ja] Second Dinner made Marvel Snap. [Ja] Ben Brode has been on - [Bri] It's all connected. [Ja] Brian David Gibler. - [Ja] Um... I played Magic a ton as a kid. [Jo] But then I moved to college. [Jo] Tried going to a local [Jo] Nobody has the accessibility [Bri] I will say that that was, like... [Bri] As soon as I was--like, a week after-- [Bri] A week out into Magic, I was like, [Bri] I was telling that to Karen; Karen, I think, told you; you told Ify. - [Bri] We ended up at the same one. - we arrived like, &quot;Oh, everyone's here.&quot; a dopamine explosion that I never thought I would have, where it was like, &quot;Oh, it was simplistic because there didn't need to be [Ify] Because we are all friends we ended up at the same place [Ja] Friends and friendly people - the ingredients that you need. [Ja] For example, who sat next to me at the event, - who some of you guys know. [Ja] And we just followed each other, and I went 2-1 at my next prerelease and I was really excited [Ja] Should've gone 3-0, but it's fine. and then she responded &quot;I'm trying to build,&quot; and I was like, (tearfully) &quot;Thank you!&quot; [Ja] And that kind of encouragement - is very meaningful to me. [Ja] In contrast... I went to an event last night, 'cause I can't stop, won't stop. [Ja] And, um, I played against a guy... who was nice in the sort of like, &quot;Oh, no problem, whatever,&quot; but then as I was untapping my - [Bri] Oh, don't do that! - [Bri] That's not allowed. [Ja] I was just like, &quot;Hey, Give me a second.&quot; Like, I'm tired. [Ja] It's like 11:00 p.m., - 'cause this event started late. - [Ify] I feel like that's a cardinal sin. [Ja] Like, &quot;Hey, you know what?&quot; [Ja] And I'd just played like, good match with somebody, and it was so long and grindy, and that guy was a gem of a person, - really pleasant to play with. [Ja] And then I went to this, &quot;You know, I'm just gonna scoop, and this is harshing my vibe,&quot; and then I got matched up - and I was having fun again suddenly. [Ja] And I was like, &quot;Right, OK. I just need to not let [Ify] It's very--like, so... [Ify] What's been funny about, and coming back into is like, as someone and who's known from a lot of things, if someone was like, &quot;I know you [Ify] I remember when I first started, [Ify] Now I'm like, [Ify] The only time I've started &quot;You're getting into Magic.&quot; I'm like, [Ify] And, like, not even [Ify] The show that I did for Magic predates a lot of Magic shows. [Ify] On Geek &amp; Sundry, [Ify] There was the Spellslingers, but on this Twitch stream we did Mulligan. [Ify] That's how I met Brian Kibler; - [Jo] I keep thinking it's you. - [Bri] It's how we met. [Ify] But I met so many people, [Ify] I went to my first Grand Prix, and then I was kind of [Ify] I met a lot of good friends. [Ify] But then, as I just got busy, um, and didn't have it really kind of started waning. [Ify] But one of the things was people who are like that. [Ify] And I know that, like, it comes with the territory, specifically the type - [Ja] Yeah. where a guy, like--I... [Ify] When I did Grand Prix Vegas, which we'll all see at MagicCon. - [Ify] I'm so sure we'll end up there. - [Ja] That's in October. [Ify] We are gonna talk off-air. - [Ify] Don't worry. [Ify] But it was huge, if I'm being generous to this guy, I'mma say 10 minutes, [Ify] But it definitely was not that long. [Ify] I sit down, and he goes, &quot;Oh, [Ify] Mind you, I'm looking around, and he was like, &quot;No, [Ify] I was like, &quot;What?&quot; and the judge is so confused. [Ify] We play. I win first round, [Ify] This was, funny enough, - [Ify] I wanna say 2015. [Ify] Uh, 2014, 2015. [Ify] Yeah, 2014, 2015. [Ify] Either way, um, it was [Ify] Pulled an O-ring [Ify] Then, &quot;Wait, [Ify] Turns out when he it shuffled in, and the &quot;Double DQ. You have not enough cards. You have an [Ify] It's funny, 'cause I was like, I would've just been like, But because you - [Ja] &quot;I'll bring us both down.&quot; - [Ja] Well, he brought you both down. [Ify] The judge immediately-- 'cause the judge was pissed at you [Ify] He was like, &quot;I shouldn't have took - [Ja] &quot;Took this match,&quot; OK. [Jo] I guess that is a good call [Ify] &quot;I shouldn't have [Bri] &quot;I should have never tried, [Ja] At divorce court. [Ify] With this game, where there's so many people they have the best deck, [Ify] Just early on, they're so sure that when they start to lose, and just start trying to &quot;Oh, this is wrong,&quot; and [Ify] I was like, &quot;You're past day one if that's what you're--&quot; [Ify] If you're already, day one, trying to tweak the outside of the game, that deck's not going anywhere, buddy. [Jo] I think being a uh, casualty of any hobby where they can't make it a hybrid or at the very least find the fun [Jo] And in some cases, that they get little... that they're sated by but or a podcast they made for a bunch and they hate the cohost, but [Ja] Sorry. Wait, are you referring - [Bri] Unrelated. - (Brian laughing) [Jo] But I respect those of them - that can, like... separate themselves from the meta and then indulge in, &quot;We're having (all agreeing) - [Jo] But it is a craft. [Bri] And I will say that, in general, Magic players in the same way, in every hobby, [Bri] It's just you remember [Bri] It's the same thing, &quot;I can't play this fighting game anymore 'cause this woman's and it's like, those [Bri] That is a very specific and everyone in the hobby [Bri] It's the same with Magic. [Ja] Did the boob size change [Ify] You know, but that's what's been so &quot;GamerGate 2,&quot; or the guy who made the Firefall bus. [Ify] You know, like-- [Jo] Creator of &quot;Young Shadowheart&quot; mod. - [Ja] Oh my God! [Ify] All this stuff happens [Bri] He was just going [Bri] He has it on his thing. - [Ja] You're perfect, queen. - [Jo] &quot;So old!&quot; [Ja] Jordan got me this. (laughs) [Ify] You know, I can't take a anime loli version of [Ify] But you know, and you're on Twitter, - it seems like that's the zeitgeist. [Ify] And then you step outside, [Ify] Like, I challenge everyone go to the GameStop and ask someone - [Ify] They're like, &quot;I don't know.&quot; [Jo] &quot;Who is that? Is that Bayonetta?&quot; [Jo] &quot;Why is Bayonetta in this?&quot; - [Ify] &quot;Bayonetter.&quot; [Bri] &quot;Bayonetter.&quot; that's getting really into weeb stuff. [Ja] Wait, hold on. I feel like [Jo] Well, partner, I've been [Bri] Bobby doesn't even have one waifu. (all laughing) [Ja] That's a really good Hank. [Jo] Well, partner, you better [Ja] Ha! I'll tell you what. [Ja] Me and my friends used to say over and over in Hank Hill voice. [Ify] (imitating Boomhauer) (all laughing) - [Ify] Spiral to the heavens. [Ja] Um, so we've prepared-- [Ja] We'll move on from the Magic moment, but it'll probably come back. [Jo] Oh, that would - [Ja] The Magic Moment? [Ja] This magic moment! [Ja] You license it. You use [Jo] You guys could do the show, and I'll be off-mic, - [Bri &amp; Ify] Yeah. hand [over] fist. [Jo] I do have a Amazon cart of, like, &quot;Which one should I get?&quot; [Ja] Oh, yeah. And I am gonna-- [Ja] I wanna host, um-- [Ja] Karen and I were, like, two minds about this, - where we wanna host for beginners. [Ja] Um, to just teach people. - [Ja] I know you already know. [Jo] I played so little Commander. [Ja] I would say that, like-- [Ja] I will probably only play Commander [Ja] The social dynamics of it - extend beyond the game. [Ja] Because there's also an issue - [Ify] Yes. Oh, yes. they really wanna win, so they... [Ja] And then what I've heard [Ja] Like, I met some really nice and one of them, after we played, sometimes... you play against 'That was a pleasant person to play,'&quot; and he said that about me, and I was like, about how they go to some and people will lie about [Ja] They'll be like, &quot;Yeah, and then they'll be like, [Ify] To me, that's been the new thing. [Ify] Like, for most things, [Ify] But when people gauge power level, - [Ja] Yeah. - [Jo] A little scouter, dude. [Ja] &quot;It's power level 6, [Ify] Oh my God, yeah. We were [Ify] Like I said, my friend who [Ify] I was like, &quot;You need us. You need - [Ja] Yeah. [Ja] But yeah, just to your point, [Ja] I like it as a social-- - [Ja] It's like a board game. [Jo] Yeah, and I've had some bad where the alchemy of it is just wrong. [Jo] Like any part of your hang. [Ify] And it gets real fun when you get like I've done matches with [Ify] You can go up to like [Ify] You'd think it'd break it, those Commander-specific cards, you draw as many cards shit like that gets crazy in a fun way. [Ja] The reason that there can be that get hundreds of thousands of views, like Commander at Home or is because when you and it's basically just a podcast where people shoot the shit making fun of their situation or &quot;Oh, I think Ify's got threat,&quot; I simply have a few lands down.&quot; It's - [Ja] That type of-- for people that have never played before. I was not in charge of the structure [Jo] It can universally be or even very close to, - and it's wrong. [Jo] And if I were to take trade them out for three strangers but just happen to fit them, take the surplus, do the same, it would work, - [Ja] It's like forming a band. [Jo] Yeah. One of them dies. [Bri] I just wanna point out that, um, I think at least three times &quot;We're gonna move on and then have gone right back into Magic. - [Ja] Another thing about Magic is-- [Bri] When you're thinking about it, [Bri] You wanna... [Ja] Yeah, you draw a card, - and you play Magic for additional turns. [Jo] There's a &quot;beep, be right back,&quot; it comes back, and - [Ify] Yeah. [Ja] Uh, but OK. (laughs) [Ja] So! Uh, we prepared, um, two little stories today that kind of match the of each of our guests. [Ja] So, for Ify, there's a new [Bri] I was really worried that you [Bri] &quot;As our resident white guy here - [Ja] No one clip that! [Ja] There's a lot of context. [Jo] And for Brian, Trump! [Jo] He's pretty cool, huh? [Ja] And for Brian, a second [Jo] Brian, the audio - but can you take the MAGA hat off? - [Bri] I will go ahead and-- [Ja] What the hell? [Ify] Um... yeah, this woman is so... - [Ify] It gets scary out there. [Ja] Jacob? Take your pick. [Ify] Yeah, let's get her (all laughing) - [Jo] The master at work. [Ja] Oh, wait. Actually, 'cause this isn't - [Ify] I think it is. [Ify] Yeah, 'cause I didn't know [Ify] I was like, &quot;Who's this [Ja] (laughs) That's why [Jo] A honeypot. [Ja] He's like, &quot;I watched it [Bri] &quot;I don't see [Ify] &quot;I don't know why [Jo] &quot;This is just like what [Ja] &quot;Ify, un-quote-tweet this! [Ify] &quot;Turn the sound on!&quot; [Jo] Timestamp. <i>OK, this time I have a beef <i>I can make criticisms to all, - <i>equity and inclusion here, right?</i> <i>So, I'm sick and tired of <i>or like guys, certain guys,</i> <i>thinking that all girls are gold diggers.</i> <i>I don't know if it's because [Bri] Oh my God, - [Jo] What the fuck?<i> <i>You're getting the opinion <i>and, uh, immigrants fresh off the boat</i> - <i>looking for a green card.</i> [Ify] By the way, I only saw [Ify] It's so bad [Jo] This has a kind of-- [Jo] The escalation at play, it's like, &quot;These stupid girls... who, by the way, - [Ja] &quot;And they're whores as well.&quot; [Bri] I was originally she's like, &quot;I'm just and I was like, &quot;Is that [Bri] Then I was like, &quot;Oh, no, and then immediately say the N-word.&quot; - [Jo] She's tickling the boundary. [Ja] You know if you watch one of and they'll just be doing weaving every word, and then and they just work it into the freestyle, that's what I feel like she's doing [Bri] Someone has the cue cards up with all of the most inflammatory words. [Bri] &quot;Say something about this one!&quot; [Ja] I will also acknowledge - [Jo] Listen up! - [Ja] So, let's let the woman speak. [Ify] Yeah, let's see what she has to say. <i>Immigrants fresh off the boat, <i>Yes, they are <i>But that's the exception. <i>Everybody I know <i>they're married to (Jarvis &amp; Jordan laughing) - [Jo] Whoooooa! [Ify] 'Cause you can see her - [Ja] She was preparing. - [Bri] Oh, man. - [Ify] But also... - like, &quot;The exception, I'm the rule.&quot; - [Ja] &quot;I am the one who knocks!&quot; [Bri] Yeah, first off, there's a lot [Ja] I specifically [Jo] It's actually incredible that this is that her saying the N-word is like... the fourth most interesting part of it. [Ify] But also, what's is we often talk about how or any version of the N-word, and I think the proof here is how bad it fumbles out of her mouth. - [Bri] Immediately. - (Jordan laughs) - [Ify] Yeah, &quot;broke-ass nigga.&quot; [Jo] Yeah, she's not comfortable with it. [Ify] It seems like she's reading, like, - reading off of the Lyric.com. [Jo] Clips of Adin Ross just trying to [Bri] The English teacher teaching &quot;We're gonna read this [Ja] &quot;Remember, it's in a [Ify] &quot;And it's not gonna be weird, 'cause - [Ja] A child hears them chanting it. - [Jo] &quot;Let's just call him 'Jim.'&quot; [Jo] &quot;Let's stick with that.&quot; [Ja] She went for the kickflip, - and now how does she ride away? - [Bri] The lean-in for that.<i> [Bri] &quot;They're married to...&quot; [Ja] And it's like, &quot;All right, I'm gonna crack some pepper here.&quot; [Jo] That truly is the - [Ify] Yeah. - [Ify] Yeah. &quot;Ah!&quot; [Ify] She used a double-grip [Jo] It doesn't feel like [Ify] I feel like that's the - [Jo] She just swallows an eggplant. [Jo] Like, &quot;O--oh.&quot; [Ja] There's too much moving things. [Ja] It's like when you watch - and, like, breathing fire or whatever. to keep track, hot sauce, olive oil, - a shit-ton of garlic. - [Ify] Yeah, all of it. And now pepper. [Ja] And they say - [Ja] Yeah, so what's the problem here? [Ify] Also, there seems to be a bunch [Ify] It seems like she's at one of those - LA rental places. - [Ify] Yeah. - [Ify] Yeah. <i>...couldn't care less <i>My type is broke mechanics</i> <i>and surfer hippie dudes</i> <i>who just wanna live in <i>All I ask of a man is <i>you're, um...</i> - <i>you're not a pussy--</i> - [Ja] Yeah, I know. - whitest thing-- - like, &quot;blue-collar&quot; or... LA, SoCal native, nothing about you would attract [Ify] Like, there's not a-- [Ify] You're a mechanic's--like, [Ify] Like, that's--but, you know... [Jo] And you're brave enough [Ify] Yeah. This is wild. [Jo] She's more veteran-coded. [Jo] I feel like that would be [Ja] What's funny is I don't-- [Ja] I use the N-word extremely [Ja] If I'm using it, [Ja] And this is just so unnecessarily [Ify] Because, like, honestly, and this is gonna be the wildest thing it would make more sense all of her friends are married because there's no reason because I am a strong proponent of - [Ja] Right, of course. [Bri] The royal. [Ify] You know, &quot;the fact-checker nigga.&quot; - (all laughing) [Ja] &quot;Could you be more specific? [Ify] &quot;I know which nigga [Jo] The royals do say it [Bri] This is like a white person who grew up rich and and is like, &quot;Let me just try saying this, 'cause none of you [Bri] &quot;So let me just give it a shot.&quot; [Jo] Like, &quot;I wanna be goth, [Jo] &quot;I wonder if [Ify] It's funny because it feels like, as if she heard the song &quot;broke niggas,&quot; that's [Ify] Like, when someone isn't [Ify] If you don't make money, - [Jo] She thought it was a seminar. [Ify] It was like, you have [Jo] I feel like he is saying [Jo] Can I just say? In that song, it really seems like Kanye [Ify] No, it's like, You just can't be a broke nigga.&quot; - [Jo] Yeah, that makes sense. [Ify] You gotta be a surfer dude. [Ify] Well, her point, it's so funny, [Ify] It's that she's like, &quot;No, [Ify] &quot;Everyone I know is married to [Ify] &quot;I, for example, I'm the rule, [Ify] But everything that is pictured so, one, you're lying about that. [Ify] Uh, two, like-- [Jo] The only fault because she doesn't care about so all that's left... [Bri] The thing is, like, this will... [Bri] What you were saying, to go into alt-right commentator, right? [Bri] This is the way uh, &quot;Become a parent for some reason, have just enough that the 'But she said it in a positive way!'&quot; [Bri] And it's like, &quot;But she should've [Ify] Yeah, and then everyone shares who says it in their song, and there's [Ify] I think... [Ify] One, I think that the, like, gold... that is being a right-wing talking head isn't as rich as it is, &quot;She got fired,&quot; and like, &quot;Who cares? and I was like, &quot;No.&quot; (laughs) [Ify] I think she's gonna be [Ja] We'll see. Well, this-- [Ja] As someone who watches weird this has all of the elements of but it's like a race to the bottom, where there's only so much [Ja] There's only so much, like... [Ja] It almost doesn't feel... it's weird but everything about it [Ify] No, I think you're right. [Ify] I think she hit [Ify] The big thing that got her [Ify] But she is hitting all of their [Ify] So you're right; and I think that the [Ify] And I just think it's not as but I think that there is a element to it, because this is so very well-shot. [Jo] It's actually oddly [Jo] It feels like front-porching to highlight a lot of to be like, &quot;And I'm like you guys, I just like all the same stuff, you know... do you like me?&quot; [Ify] Well, no, it's very pick-me, where it's like, &quot;We don't [Bri] But it is the same thing of, [Bri] &quot;The only materialistic people who come here specifically and they're gonna marry your husbands.&quot; - [Bri] It's like, &quot;No, stop it.&quot; [Bri] It very clearly has all of &quot;I know... I know what and most people wouldn't go out and now I'm clarified. this is exactly what [Jo] That's the only rule is saying the N-word. (laughs) [Jo] Isn't that what she said? [Ja] Yeah. &quot;I'M the rule.&quot; [Ja] It's such a funny line to me. [Ja] Wait, Jacob, - [JACOB] She posts a response. [Ja] Have y'all seen this one? It's great. [Ify] Well, like you said, step two, - [Bri] Yup. - video of all time. [Jo] Wait, does it say - [Ja] Yeah. - [Ja] Yeah. - [Jo] City of angels.<i> <i>seems to have, um,</i> <i>upset members of a certain community, and--</i> [Jo] Broke. (laughs) - [Ja] The broke community. <i>Um, all the backlash <i>just really do a deep dive, - <i>And after all that,</i> <i>I still couldn't find a care.</i> <i>You're gonna call us racist?</i> <i>You're gonna call us <i>Fuck. You.</i> <i>War.</i> - [Ify] I mean-- - [Bri] Wow! Wow. [Jo] That's like if they died [Jo] It's the first... (buzzing) [Bri] Yeah. I mean, here's the thing-- [Bri] I mean, this is such the people who are like, &quot;I can [Bri] And it's like, &quot;Yeah, - [Bri] &quot;That's fine.&quot; wild how horny people that just do not understand &quot;It's my First Amendment and you won't go to jail. That doesn't [Ja] You're not protected [Ify] You're not protected - with your First Amendment free speech. but it doesn't mean [Ify] Also, here's the thing: yeah, is so that you can have - [Ja] Who was the guy in that clip? - [JACOB] I have no idea. - who, um... [Ja] Oh, I know who you're thinking of. [Ify] The one who's the [Jo] Piers Morgan? - [Ify] Yes. but what's fun is that, if you - it turned his mouth into a rectangle. - [Jo] Oh, wow. - <i>...you.</i> - [Jo] Whoa! - [Ja] Yeah, a perfect rectangle. [Bri] Forgive me to this actor, &quot;He kinda looks like [Bri] Um, but then again, that's how every - [Bri] It's just kind of how it is. - [Jo] The face-to-head proportions. [Jo] It looks like he's carrying - [Ja] I don't even know if, like-- [Ify] I was just saying lots - have big-ass foreheads. - [Ify] Yeah. [Jo] Is this Larry Flynt? [Bri] Larry Flynt was an old, like-- [Bri] Let me do a little Googling - [Ify] See? - [Bri] This is what I'm here for. [Ify] But also, like, he... truly, like, that was [Ify] I hate to say this, but - right-wing talking heads that-- [Ja] He was the founder - [Ify] What? [Ify] Oh, that's so funny. founder of Hustler magazine, [Ify] That's so funny, free speech was talking about having porn and stuff like that, and something that you are [Ja] That's so funny, - [Ify] They never do! and they're like, &quot;I don't need to like when Martin Luther King [Jo] Also, I think there's a the word &quot;offensive,&quot; with a specific ideology and [Jo] Honestly, the sentiment &quot;One thing that defines free speech is that it should be free speech [Ja] &quot;If you're not offending anyone, [Jo] I guess that's true, but it doesn't mean [Jo] It just means anyone. 'cause if you change somebody else would be a target. [Ja] Also, the protection [Jo] Yeah. Not lateral. [Ja] It's like being able to - [Bri] Exactly. It's built for that. [Ify] That's basically [Ify] You know, they have a weird - [Ja] Was it him?! [Bri] Of course. So, yeah, - if she edited that in-- - [Ify] Rock on. [Bri] Which is--the thing is, I do--I don't love the fact that, like, there are people jump straight to this, where it's like, maybe in 3 videos, and then where I say the N-word, whatever Breitbart thing.&quot; [Ify] Can we find out the [Ify] Um, gottem! [Bri] Got him! [Ify] I like that he did die - [Jo] Yeah, dude. because a lot of, like-- [Ify] And this isn't even a joke, bigoted talking heads and I was like, &quot;Damn, [Jo] It's corrupting, yeah. [Ja] Well, they said he had an [Bri] Oh, just like the Grinch. [Jo] That's why they have [Ja] This last one - [Bri] Oh, boy. and then she was like, because I don't wanna work [Jo] Wait, sorry. Sorry to interrupt. [Jo] On that previous, that second one, did she say, - [Ify] Yeah, &quot;I just can't find a care.&quot; - [Bri] No. [Ify] It's so funny, too, because, like, - someone who just fumbled out the N-word, who's just so afraid of (all laughing) [Jo] Yeah, it's weird to jump [Jo] It's actually interesting to see [Ja] Right. Haven't heard [Ja] I guess &quot;ass&quot; is the only [Jo] &quot;I don't like broke people [Ja] Yeah. <i>So, all those nerds in high school,</i> <i>like the weird theater kids - [Ify] &quot;Annie-may.&quot; - [Bri] Yup, that's us. was immediately being infuriated - [Bri] &quot;Annie-may.&quot; [Jo] Annie May Adika. [Ja] There was that Jay-Z lyric but I thought he was saying - &quot;Jay-Z weeb confirmed?!&quot; [Jo] &quot;We're exactly the same!&quot; - [Jo] And I was disappointed. <i>You know who I'm talking about. <i>They've grown up now, <i>They're the Mark Zuckerbergs.</i> <i>They're the Faucis of the world, - [Bri] That's true. - [Ify] Yeah. - [Jo] Sorry. [Jo] I get that, again, it's another - to go against Fauci, the lawmaker. [Ify] Yeah, the scientist is a nerd. [Jo] (laughing) Calling him a [Ja] It's very funny to not mention - [Ify] Yeah. [JACOB] I feel like theater kids - (all agreeing) they're the ones making the laws!&quot; [Bri] Theater kids are changing the world where they talk about their father issues. [Bri] And, look, hey, - I can make fun of other theater kids. [Bri] I don't take it from you. especially one who says the N-word. [Ja] It feels like the internal monologue - of a mean girl in high school. [Ja] They're like, &quot;Finally, I can stuff these nerds [Jo] &quot;Hey, TikTok audience that's - do you remember nerds?&quot; [Jo] &quot;People different from you?&quot; [Ja] Yeah, the people who, uh, had niche interests, <i>...fucking dorks that never <i>and they got a major chip on <i>That's why you see all these <i>&quot;Oh, you can be obese <i>They're the ones (Jordan laughing) [Bri] Wait a second! How do I [Bri] How do I join the - [Bri] 'Cause I am trying to get in. - [Jo] A Kickstarter project. [Bri] I do think if Biden came out We're gonna make clown world,&quot; I think he [Jo] Literally, if he did that of him being really, really-- being so good at karate... - [Jo] I think he would win the election. - [Jo] Or judo or something. [Ify] Yeah. It's so funny, because... [Ify] This is obviously just someone [Ify] Like, it proves because even the most right-wing talking head, they have an agenda. [Ify] And this person [Ify] Like, what do you mean by [Ify] Like, what do you mean? [Jo] &quot;One of these fat guys, [Ify] But, like, I genuinely am like, [Ify] What laws are you trying to attack by calling that out? [Ja] There's no focus to it, because &quot;how can I list as many,&quot; like, - [Ify] Divisive. - [Ify] But not even, like, real political dog whistles, though, but these are like TikTok-based ones, where it's like, &quot;Oh, I know all the so I'm gonna talk about [Ify] It really is like, yeah, this person is trying to get [Jo] And the thing is, the one thing is finding the perfect balance - between ideology and presentability. [Jo] She is not charismatic [Jo] Ben Shapiro's a smart guy, - as far as what he says. is you're doing all this. because you think you're gonna get &quot;Hey, how's it going? Uh, I saw you say the N-word. [Ja] We should do - and see if she (inaudible). <i>...actors. You wonder why actors</i> - <i>are so politically leftist?</i> <i>Oh, right, it's because - [Ja] She really hates theater kids. [Ify] It's so funny when &quot;loser theater kids,&quot; and I wish Jason Momoa would [Bri] I'm looking at &quot;Looks like somebody didn't [Jo] (laughs) Yeah. Theater kids. [Bri] I'm thinking, &quot;Oh, cast as the grandma in your show, because you didn't and you couldn't dance very well.&quot; [Bri] &quot;Sorry about that!&quot; [Ja] &quot;Everyone else is stupid and a nerd!&quot; [Ify] This has the energy of someone but was the one who was [Ify] Like, you were not a leader. [Jo] If you take away 'cause that's all it really is, if you remove that, she could how frustrating it is that &quot;Even though [Jo] Because... [Jo] If you were raised and then you're not rewarded then your brain breaks, unless - and, like, change your mind. I think the reason is because I think, um, like you said, if you were raised you believe the system [Ify] Where when you're a person of color, [Jo] You just think it's luck. [Ify] Growing up as a Black person, especially me, who wanted I was like, &quot;Oh, I must so I never am expecting it to work for me, and every road bump that that's part of it. [Ify] But if you look like this, and we're assuming that she always has, but if she's always grown in wherever the fuck she lives, she was told her whole life, &quot;Everything's You're always gonna get the best [Ify] This could be a number of things. [Ify] This could simply be having a hotter husband than her. - [Ify] You know, anything that doesn't-- [Ja] Because the way our brains work, there's no, like, extremity-- [Ja] Like, for her, [Ja] I'll say it. Her feelings are valid. [Ja] It doesn't mean - [Ify] Yeah. [Ja] Or should be retained but those feelings are or it's a performance. [Ja] And I never [Ja] One thing I don't like - &quot;Oh, it's bait, so ignore it.&quot; [Ja] But it doesn't matter [Ja] It's still getting [Ja] And the majority of people [Bri] Not to bring this back to Magic: [Bri] Uh, the thing I've found in life-- [Bri] I did not get into Magic ironically, but I could've imagined a time [Bri] The thing about if you're making rage bait or any of this, is you have to be comfortable knowing [Bri] That is always the case. [Bri] Every time you're like, &quot;I'll just ironically you're gonna start saying &quot;slay&quot; all the [Bri] And so if you're ever going to make sure it is a nice, kind thing to do. [Bri] Because if you're &quot;It's just satire no, you are going to fall &quot;Anyone should be able to say the N-word. - and it gets worse. [Ify] You're so right. There was who I feel like started off as a right-wing personality and now that's who he is. [Ify] And it was very funny, like, I remember it bubbled up where his fans were because there was beef with-- [Ify] The podcast they were on blew up, [Ify] Someone, like, kind of cut out a very to make them look even worse, which, seeing the full one-- [Ify] And I think here's the thing, is I will always, like... [Ify] I don't need to fake the funk. [Ify] I will be like, [Ify] If I'm debating and they present a verifiable fact I'll be like, &quot;You're right about that,&quot; and then I will have a new stance [Ify] So I was just like, This is why they're not [Ify] And they posted the whole thing, and I was like, &quot;Damn, you're right, and they, like, all-- [Ify] 'Cause I was seeing on the Reddit [Ify] One of them finally slipped up and I retweeted it, like, and then they deleted it. [Ify] And then I saw they about these conversations, like, &quot;Oh, he saw the video See, that's why we need to not be--&quot; [Ify] Someone was trying to be like, be assholes. We should give people and I was like, &quot;Yeah, you're taking steps - to being a normal human, and these people are [Ify] But it's like, but also, my favorite part &quot;That was your friend!&quot; [Ify] And I was like, [Ify] I was like, &quot;Why don't you that you were really close that you were friends with me?&quot; [Ify] And he just stopped replying [Ify] Because no matter we were homies. We would do shows. [Ify] We would hang out and you are now - refusing to acknowledge that even lightly, because you know because even though you know the fanbase you have. [Ify] And I think we see this where people are afraid to condemn things - that they know pay their bills. [Jo] I mean, this is an issue in general, but I don't think people understand from a sincere apology. [Jo] I think people view that will pull you back, a clear apology is very effective. [Ify] I think you're right, in the age of internet, is that sometimes apologies [Ify] It's why you have to [Ify] If you're at the point where you need to just do it and log off. [Ify] Don't go looking [Jo] Your apology won't be [Ify] Yeah. Even if you're right, and no matter what, people will say, &quot;You're [Ify] You need to be like, &quot;Whatever,&quot; has created this grey area 'cause they're like, if I'm still gonna be the bad guy?&quot; [Ify] I was reading this book and it was like, a few chapters in, which I was like, &quot;Ooh, that no one really thinks about,&quot; if we're trying to build if we're trying to move forward, you're going to have to forgive [Ify] Because if he has nowhere to go, why would he give up being who he was? [Bri] I worry about people like this, where it's so easy to-- [Bri] And I wanna make this clear: if I was friends with this person and I was unaware of this, I would also and this is going to be [Ja] And then there's gonna be a bunch of [Bri] Exactly. Of course to a community that says - [Bri] And I'm not-- [Ja] Yeah, the polarization [Bri] And I'm very grateful that I am &quot;Hey, Brian, that fucking sucks, what [Bri] And then I also am grateful that that I would, right? [Bri] Where I'm like, because this goes both ways. [Bri] You tell me and then I tell you when you and we both become better as a result. [Ja] Because you're willing to listen - [Bri] Yes. [Ja] I think that if you're-- but sometimes it feels confirmed in their beliefs, where they don't feel like there's, [Ja] They feel infallible, and they aren't willing or their understanding of the world. [Ify] You make a good point. [Ify] There's something I keep and never get around to, but I think Let Me Google That For You was the downfall of because when people with Let Me Google That For You, you were basically sending the message unless you're an expert about it, and with Google, you can be an expert.&quot; [Ify] And, you know, that's when Google was [Ify] That's when you could be sure. [Ify] But now, in this where you can try and look up you can try and look up-- [Ify] Like, people aren't so they don't know that if about police brutality and shootings, that they should question FBI numbers, or that they should question surveys. [Ja] Numbers are not as because those numbers have to be presented in an editorial fashion, and that editorialism creates a narrative. [Jo] And humans are by unarticulated numbers. [Jo] Even if you wanna [Ja] How big is a billion or a million? [Jo] You need to walk almost like you're manually where you say, &quot;Here's the number I'm here is a...&quot; &quot;I'm gonna push the bike a little bit so you don't get scared because if you're too scared to &quot;The bike actually is bad. The bike doesn't work, and whoever [Ja] Right. [Bri] Yeah, it is a hard thing, I don't think that the people and anyone who is like this, I don't think they have [Bri] But I do think if someone were to come up to me, &quot;Hey, I hate immigrants,&quot; right? [Bri] If I could immediately be like-- [Bri] There's ways that you [Bri] &quot;You are doing a bad-faith argument. You are doing things just to rile me up.&quot; [Bri] Don't interact with those people, interested in them at all. [Bri] But if you are with the kind of rich white person when they're not around Black people, Please don't ever say that again. And if you start saying it in where we can tell you, 'cause that's a dumb fucking thing to do,' if I don't stop you at that point, you'll build the habit and [Jo] &quot;And if you don't wanna [Jo] Even calling it a [Jo] &quot;If you don't wanna abide by that, or at least take that on board, and also are going to demonize me then this is not a friendship. - I'm a utility to you.&quot; [Ify] You were like, [Ify] I'm like, well, [Ify] I think we've gotten real with people, where it's like, no, friendship is work. [Ify] Any relationship is work. [Ify] 'Cause I feel like we've [Ify] Like, &quot;I don't [Ify] It's like, bro, letting your [Jo] &quot;I don't wanna do - [Jo] Like, well, there's a line. - [Ify] Like, we're friends. There should-- [Ify] I get it if it's like, they are expecting you to hear them.&quot; [Ify] But if there's equity, there shouldn't be a problem. Your [Ja] And if it's not working, you're not [Ify] Yes. [Ja] For example--OK. [Ja] One thing I'll - to give feedback to someone. [Ja] Not a lot of people and you're afraid of conflict. [Jo] And people are bad at doing it. [Ja] Yes. But I'll give [Ja] For life, which is is one of the nicest things - you can do for someone. Because... - [Ja] Because it is so hard to do. [Ja] Because it takes thought [Ja] It is very much like finding &quot;Oh, Jordan would like this. [Jo] And somebody reacting if you are as considerate if you have a good dynamic with someone the... [Jo] Overthinking it shouldn't be the deciding someone that you think [Jo] Granted, try and be as but if someone gets really mad at you, then it was not your responsibility [Jo] Like going through &quot;Would you rather I dated you [Ja] I recently was in a situation where a good friend, um... was involved with something that I needed to give them [Ja] Like, &quot;Hey, I need to [Ja] And I had to talk to mutual friends, [Ja] &quot;Hey, I'm thinking of giving and I don't wanna do it. But I value this friendship, They need to hear it from me, because I know it's gonna land better [Ja] Then I finally did it, and of course and it was, &quot;Thanks for [Ja] You're kinda like, &quot;Hoo! this relationship I value [Ja] But it creates - hold your friends accountable. [Ify] You know, um, there's been many where even more so, like, where they've been-- [Ify] I've had people who've been and I think the knee-jerk thing &quot;I'mma just stop talking to you [Ify] I always contact them first. [Ify] I'll ask them about what happened. [Ify] You'd be surprised how many people [Ify] And at that point it's like, this is why, you know, we--&quot; [Ify] Like, it's been close &quot;Well, this is why we're not working [Ify] Then it's been somewhere, like, &quot;Well, this is what I wouldn't know how to navigate that, but this is what I think because I think concerned with putting out the fire, when it's like, &quot;No, you and you need to get the [Ify] No matter what, people will think the people involved to feel like that has been resolved then nothing else matters. Dan Harmon got called out for being, like, a shithead in the writers' room, [Ja] And treating - [Ify] Yes, and did the work-- [Ja] There was a back-and-forth. - [Ja] I believe she accepted it. [Ja] This was many years back, [Ify] But yeah, so just know because we're just [Ify] But there was the moment &quot;Oh, this and this happened,&quot; &quot;Well, Megan Ganz said she's--&quot; did say, &quot;Hey, we talked about it. [Ja] And that doesn't affect whether or not people wanna but it's helpful for Megan Ganz - to have their piece. [Jo] I think you'll always if you go the easy route of, like, sanding down the friction but even just seeking [Jo] It's very unpleasant. It's getting [Jo] But... if you only &quot;Actually, you don't have to you all know a little bit you do, and [Jo] It'll prohibit you [Jo] You'll have a membrane between you because it'll be built on a foundation [Jo] I've had, just like friends with public at various levels of severity, but in all cases, I just--it's... [Jo] &quot;Cutting them off&quot; is a term &quot;That's just an excuse for and it's like, &quot;No.&quot; It's just... [Jo] The result could still but let's resolve it. [Jo] And let's also, selfishly, I would like as much insight to be either an advocate when people ask me about it. [Jo] And I don't think there's - [Bri] No. [Jo] They indicate no personal growth &quot;OK, we just can't [Bri] I think, also, 'cause we're talking about people who [Bri] And I think that to understand that and actual social relationships [Bri] So it's like, yes, and then it turns out that this dude and then doesn't change, I'm not and I'm also not gonna try to 'cause he doesn't know me. - [Jo] And it soured the enjoyment. [Jo] It's just a Let's Play channel, [Bri] You're gonna find another [Bri] It's not a hard thing [Jo] Only 40% of them [Bri] Exactly. You know, it's but you can find them. They do exist. [Bri] Uh, but the thing I think that have made difficult for people is that you have to respond where it's like, yes, it's OK for and be like, &quot;I'm not gonna watch That is totally fine. [Bri] And in certain cases with an actual [Bri] If they are doing heinous and I won't interact with them anymore.&quot; [Bri] That's fine. the reason I think a lot of [Bri] You don't even realize. &quot;I'm a big fan of having parasocial [Bri] It's because it [Bri] It gives you the same serotonin. and it takes away all of the hard work. - [Ja] All the risk, all the work. and I absolutely smoke him and he doesn't wanna talk to me &quot;I'm sorry. I promise to - [Jo] &quot;'Cause you can't handle it.&quot; [Bri] And that's good, &quot;Oh, he had a bad reaction to me? [Ja] On top of that, there is public relationships and collaborations - and private friendships. [Ja] So it's like, if... [Ja] And how that's because if you're lifelong and then they have a depending on the severity of the scandal, there is a degree of rehabilitation that that person has to have [Ja] And it may just so happen are people who also have platforms. [Ja] Now, those people but to excommunicate them isolating, and I think you're allowed what you want to do as a friend. [Jo] Something that puts me whether this is practical or not, there's something that just, principle-y, makes me very uncomfortable about... cutting someone out... and, ugh, I don't know how to be... [Jo] Oh, I don't like the feeling of considering my brand and PR optics over a person I know. - [Ja] In my private relationships. and I think that's enough of a good [Ja] If your little brother are you excommunicating [Ja] Are you canceling him [Ify] Yeah, I think it was where you have the [Ify] And I think a lot of people don't realize that there are [Ify] I think of a lot of times when and someone's like, &quot;Whoa, [Ja] &quot;Crossover episode!&quot; [Ify] And I'm like, [Ify] But I think it's there is that last thing that, if we are trying to really do this thing of fixing and rehabilitation and really kind of resolving things, you do want them to have a support group to help push them along [Ja] I feel that is a part of [Ify] It's you, because I think that is is even when you're not involved, if it's someone who or someone who you're friends with, when they do something, [Ify] You're like, &quot;Oh, &quot;You may know about this person so it's like, &quot;Oh, I do wanna [Ify] I do wanna call and be like, Are you going with this? [Ify] And once again, like I said, because we always feel like we because there is just never any nuance. [Ify] We wanna take [Ify] Of course, it's not a [Ify] It's different reactions [Ify] So, I think giving folks in conversations like these-- [Ify] We don't mean, like, I was just like, &quot;Hey, - Hope you're not murderin'!&quot; You know? - [Ify] Yeah. [Ja] Another thing is, like, what is the best outcome? [Ja] The best outcome is that people who are close to can have some sort of impact, like in opening their perspective. [Ja] I don't have high hopes. But-- [Jo] I also don't think you do have [Jo] I think you're lying. [Ify] Well, because there's, you know... [Ify] There's an element of shame if you did have friends when you-- [Ify] When people do [Ify] Sometimes I'll see a video and they'll throw in a, and I was like, &quot;Oh, that's the shame.&quot; [Ify] You know you're saying some stuff [Jo] But they're also aware and the brand that they wanna maintain... [Jo] &quot;You know [Jo] Like, &quot;Obviously, I don't, but if I can remove them, actually went on a date - so essentially I'm Martin Luther King.&quot; - [Ify] &quot;Martin Luther King.&quot; [Bri] Yeah, we've solved this issue. [Bri] It is tough. there's also a certain point where, like, this is an adult woman. [Bri] Like, we also can be very clear [Bri] I will say that there are definitely who are now doing things on the internet and they don't [understand] of doing that kind of stuff online. [Bri] It is very difficult. [Bri] Be careful about, like, just posting [Bri] And also, I wanna say that... [Bri] I'm sure you've where you've known people &quot;I did not get along with them,&quot; and and been like, &quot;Holy shit, you're because you have had outside of the time and so I can't just who said something mean to me once.&quot; [Jo] I think--we've all obviously salt of the earth, content creators. [Jo] We're all jacked. We're, you know, I can also crush a watermelon - [Ify] Yeah. - [Ify] Yeah. [Jo] I think people, at all ages any insulated environment, you can get so isolated that you or social agility to be able to or immediately recognize is because of what you said and not because of the demographic [Jo] All with dorky backgrounds, of self-identifying as an outsider, to whatever degree I was, and then... growing up, moving out of my relatively and then going, &quot;Oh, a lot of the nicest - [Jo] There is no... [Bri] We all want to be the &quot;Oh, nobody understands me, and [Bri] Everyone has to [Bri] You're gonna [Bri] And if you don't, [Jo] The reason that people think or at least I self-identified, is because and stop listening to DragonForce. [Ja] One of the goals because there are [Ja] Like, I think one thing is that kind of pipelines that you can get or the polarization of the internet. [Ja] Like, one thing I try to at outwardly alienate people, and making mistakes and... because those people are if you can welcome them in and expose it can at least expand their, uh, exposure to different perspectives. [Ja] I don't know. because on the internet or you can see the outfit someone's [Ja] We saw the American flag on her shirt - [Ja] You know? - says a lot about a podcast. [Jo] Recording at night in a or a WeWork-style environment, and then on the far side of the panel is some guy with, like, &quot;Zane&quot; a gamertag-style username, who speaks to 30 women at the same time that they paid on Craigslist to, like, &quot;Do you know what a car is?&quot; and then looking to camera, saying, [Ify] That's where things is starting to become because I feel like those are these videos that make people think, &quot;All women are like this, 'cause he - And it's like, &quot;Well, no.&quot; [Bri] Scientifically, it falls apart [Ja] Not statistically significant at all. [Jo] The extraneous value - [Ify] Yeah. [Ify] I know. It's very see that never be considered, [Ify] But I think that's things that, you're not really being like, &quot;Oh, what is the motivation behind this?&quot; [Ify] &quot;Why is this...?&quot; where, you know, everyone loves to-- [Ify] I remember there was where this guy painted his face black so that he can be in the middle - and people were basically like-- - [Ify] Well, there was the-- [Ify] Camouflage. But, like, there was the discuss of and, um... [Ify] But someone was like, &quot;Well, also, your camera is perfectly set up as she's doing this to do this,&quot; and I was like, yeah, I think [Ify] How well [done] was this &quot;prank&quot; if your wife had this running camera next [Ify] 'Cause it was like, we know how night vision would be shot if you were trying to [Ify] But then, also, where they went with a navy blue, and that didn't look like but it also disappeared you in the night. [Jo] It just feels like--I think... [Jo] Ignorance is almost [Jo] It can be a lack of care and say, &quot;Well, [Jo] But there seems to be the assumption that if you are not morally [Jo] Anyone criticizing you as opposed to, &quot;Well, you're - You knew you were.&quot; [Jo] &quot;Do not now have-- Do not die on this hill - [Bri] Yeah. [Ify] But then you get more hits and than when you're actually creating, right? [Ify] So it almost feels like &quot;OK, I'll do this video, but if people think I'm going in blackface and there's an argument in the comments, And then I can potentially later be like, 'Well, as you can see, the woke mob didn't want me [Jo] &quot;Once again, just 'cause I did something.&quot; [Bri] Be aware of the fact-- [Bri] Sorry. One final thing but just the algorithms are really good at knowing when you click on anything. [Bri] And if you click on ragebait, [Bri] And so of course you're just because the algorithm and that is a very, very dangerous thing. [Bri] It is an incredibly dangerous thing it's so much easier for and then to show you and then you're gonna buy a jacket. [Bri] That's exactly what [Bri] And so know that the more you're going to see that thing. [Bri] So please choose that thing - [Bri] That's better than anything else. that test they do with children to see if they can do where it's like you get or if you don't eat this marshmallow [Ja] Like, we are so bad at because, uh, your information diet... [Ja] Instead of... like, your and I'm gonna equate us to [Ja] As kids, we weren't [Ja] It's like, &quot;Oh, OK, [Ja] And if I had my choice, - [Ja] And an algorithm is that candy. [Ja] Because they have found... [Ja] Like, we are all children, &quot;I've got a bunch of Snickers bars,&quot; Ooh, a treat. Why do I feel so bad?&quot; - (all agreeing) - [Jo] &quot;Who did this to me?&quot; like, I can't remember the specifics, but Facebook either in some they found that they could detect and they could manipulate that. [Ja] There was a big controversy [Ja] And that is the playbook now. [Ja] Like, the algorithms are like... [Ja] It's not as insidious... from the standpoint of [Ja] They're not evil, and [Ja] Maybe someone somewhere, but the actual people working - are just trying to maximize. [Ja] They're trying to make numbers go up, [Ja] And the problem with that is the easiest way to maximize - is this divisiveness, is making you feel extreme emotion. [Ja] And it makes you feel-- [Ja] It's why 24-hour news [Ja] It's like, &quot;There was a plane--&quot; like, everyone's scared to fly on because the doors keep flying off, but then we also know that planes [Ja] It's like, OK, and it's really hard to... [Ja] I think it's very hard to evaluate these situations [Ja] So... you know, be... [Ja] Easier said than done, but like, be mindful of your [Bri] If you are sitting on &quot;I should be doing work, and all I'm doing is scrolling and you're like, &quot;I would much rather do anything other than that. I say this-- [Bri] I'm gonna watch this clip. [Bri] Can you please clip this section - so that way it pops up on my algorithm? [Bri] At least every third reel, &quot;Hey, you would have so much so go play Elden Ring. Don't beat [Ja] &quot;Shadows of Erdtree [Jo] &quot;But there's all the friction [Bri] Yeah. Terrible! [Jo] &quot;When I can just - [Bri] Yeah. my brain in bed while I'm scrolling. so I should just sit here [Ja] We actually have, um, - [Ja] We had so many fun things. [Ja] Yeah, we'll save them for next time. [Ja] This was just people on TikTok - but it's ridiculous. - [Jo] The captions... [Ja] Yeah, let's watch this. I'm curious. [Jo] The caption is <i>We were about to go to bed</i> <i>when I realized that - [Ja] &quot;We were about to go to bed.&quot; [Bri] I think there is [Bri] The thing that probably-- is this idea that we have to - when I never wanna do anything. [Bri] And it is the most, like, - I can keep working even after 9:30 p.m.&quot; are out of this world.&quot; - [Bri] That's great. Congratulations. to have ignored the fact [Jo] You should have more toothpaste. [Bri] If I hit 9:30 p.m. guess I'm gonna have a [Bri] I'm not doing nothing about this. [Ify] Also, it's like, if you - you should've noticed. <i>So my husband went <i>Look, he's very precise in his [Ja] I see why people hate this. [Ja] They're putting it [Bri] Yeah. There is that... - [Bri] Here's the thing. [Bri] Live how you love. [Bri] I think that's fantastic for you. [Bri] If I came over to your house I will leave and I'll judge you, but I'll also understand that you [Bri] And that's beautiful. [Bri] There is a certain point where I have to understand that I can't stop being productive. [Bri] That's my issue when - &quot;I have to do this thing, or else--&quot; [Ja] They're tuned to [Ja] Equally valid. - [Ja] I don't know enough about them. [Jo] I feel like if I went to their house, - [Jo] I'd become an ingredient. [Ify] But also, it's something like, everything we watch online, we have to remember that it was put there. [Ify] Like, nothing [Ja] Your kitchen is not lit for [Ify] Yeah, so when this means you went and set up that-- [Ify] That's why it was real funny when who was going shopping &quot;For you to catch yourself you had to go set up a [Ify] It's the same thing here, and when it is at-home stuff. But no, you still had to light this kitchen. [Ify] You're telling me [Ify] You got your kid, holding, like-- [Bri] I have, you know, and I cannot think of a &quot;Here's what I'm gonna do: as they are doing work [Bri] It's like, &quot;No, We are both very busy right now.&quot; [Jo] &quot;My child did doodoo, but we were out of diapers, and I was able to go through our roses, extract the petals, and [Ja] &quot;I cut down the tree, and [Jo] &quot;Another bark diaper [Ja] Yes. It's just [a] woodworked diaper. [Jo] It's a wooden baby. - how you make toothpaste. [Bri] Now I need to make toothpaste. - so I am going to be using this one. <i>...some bentonite clay.</i> <i>He added that to a bowl <i>We weren't making a huge batch, - <i>He mixed it until it was all smooth--</i> [Jo] You should make a huge batch. [Ja] They make a single - [Jo] That's why you keep running out. [Bri] You can meal-prep this. [Bri] Go ahead and make a lot. [Jo] It's roasting a chicken, eating one [Ja] Life hack: I buy [Ja] So even when I run out, [Jo] There's so many ingredients. <i>...he moved on to <i>and adding that <i>He also added a <i>He gave that a really good mix; <i>before he added <i>which were some stevia [Jo] Are these PJs? [Bri] Wait a second. [Bri] This is the pose [Bri] As he was mixing. (all laughing) [Bri] It was this, like, JoJo pose. (all laughing) [Ja] Oh, yeah, look at him! [Jo] It's like me noticing 'cause I've been pushing my - [Ja] Everything is too perfect. [Ify] Well, yeah, [Ja] He's got country club, [Jo] There's something off-putting-- [Jo] I heard somebody &quot;You know those Instagram parents - [Ify] Yeah. every filter, it's a beige house [Jo] There is something, like... [Jo] OK, that aesthetic is so and anyone on a social media - knows how it works. [Jo] There is something to me about when the aesthetic [Jo] She was holding a newborn silently, dourly, like not smiling. [Jo] Like, jeez, what happened? [Ja] You know what's mean [Bri] I can't wait to hear it. [Ja] I don't know if I could be friends - [Jo] Oh, God no. [Ja] (emotionlessly) &quot;I was [Ify] Excuse me if I'm wrong; - [Ify] I'd love to see Nara do a-- [Ja] This is always [Ja] I truly do assume the worst, but then I have to catch myself [Jo] We were right about Elizabeth Holmes. [Ify] Everything about that it's like, yeah, you definitely [Ja] And that's OK to sell. - [Ify] Well... [Ify] It becomes clear [Ify] I think before, where it's like, &quot;My kid ran out [Ify] It seemed like it was [Ify] But I think when you are I think there's a part of you, there's still a part of &quot;What is this person trying to say?&quot; and I think that's [Ify] It's like, &quot;What are you selling [Ify] And I just... yeah. [Jo] A lot of it is a the medical precision, like, I do not see equality and the value of the family, and it does feel, to some extent-- but we've known [Jo] Like you said, and there is something eerie to me not understanding the reaction-- [Ja] We're two decades into manicured perfect lives. [Ja] People start to feel bad about and so that's what makes - when things appear too perfect. [Bri] If this person is like, and I do this literally every day, that's fine, as opposed to the, This is how I am a good mother, [Jo] &quot;I'm making toothpaste [Bri] Yeah. Look, I will be &quot;Ooh, this is not my vibe,&quot; but &quot;Here's how I made a bunch of squash in my little tiny plot and I'll be like, &quot;This rules! This is wish-fulfillment to me, [Ja] My version of this is like, and I'm gonna clean it real good. - It's gonna look brand-new.&quot; [Jo] &quot;It's a toothpick going between [Ja] &quot;I've got this refurbished PS5. We're [Ify] I know. because I think that is what it is. [Ify] I haven't been able to put my finger where it's just presented, because I am getting very tired of these kind of soulless, voiceless, where it's like, &quot;I'm not saying anything, so if you're saying that you put it there. I didn't say anything.&quot; - So why are you doing this?&quot; [Ify] &quot;What is going on here?&quot; she's like, &quot;Hey, I'm doing this This is what I like to do.&quot; &quot;I'm doing this. You don't have to.&quot; [Ify] You are choosing but present it and show and if someone has a problem you're [Ify] Like, &quot;But you're not saying [Ja] Great question, though. - [Ja] And how many followers? [Jo] Yeah, oh my God. 7.5. [Ja] Oh, hell yeah. - [Ja] Awesome. - [Ify] Yeah, what's it say? - [Jo] Yeah, &quot;This is--&quot; - [Jo] &quot;This is random,&quot; &quot;IG...&quot; [Jo] This is random, dude. - [Jo] I actually really like random. - [Ja] I wanna see him brush with it. - [Bri] If they don't show him brushing... <i>...before mixing that up one last time</i> <i>and transferring that <i>I know everyone's teeth are different,</i> <i>so this might not work for [Ja] Everyone's teeth [Bri] Most teeth are pretty similar. [Bri] There's a lot of times where [Bri] Teeth are different, [Jo] Everyone has [Ja] When I go to &quot;Well, everybody's teeth are [Ify] Here's the thing. and why I think I do get is that this would be a [Ify] And I tried to go zero-waste, and I say all that to say, I knew that was what 'cause I tried to go [Ify] And those toothpastes suck so bad. [Ify] It sucks so hard. and it doesn't foam up and [Ify] It tastes bad. And I can tell, because Nara put the smallest smidgen 'cause I know she [Ja] Like when somebody does the kitchen - and they take a little tiny... - [Ja] &quot;Oh, delicious.&quot; [Ja] &quot;How much garlic [Jo] &quot;Did you say the N-word?&quot; [Bri] &quot;This tastes like you [Jo] Spelled out with SpaghettiOs. [Ify] Yeah, and I know that and I kind of presented why I think but there is just something that I think he needs to turn it down. [Ify] I think he needs to [Bri] What do you think [Ify] The hairstyle! if I showed someone a clip of this, like, &quot;This is from a movie. What is it about?&quot; [Jo] Yeah, an alternate timeline - [Ify] Like, it is so Aryan. there was a time when I was like, and then every and I was like, &quot;I guess - [Bri] &quot;That's gonna have to happen.&quot; [Ja] That spread fast to the alt-right, [Bri] I've just been trying to wear and I can't do it anymore as a white man. [Bri] What a shame. [Jo] &quot;I had a red armband [Ify] Even the Elvis swoop I'm like, &quot;Nah, bro, it's just giving... It's giving secret police.&quot; (all laughing) - [Ja] It's giving Inglourious? [Jo] (German accent) [Jo] (stilted American accent) [Jo] &quot;Ah, what is going on, [Ify] Yeah. Um, and it - the whitest Black woman, you know? [Ify] Like, and I want 'cause I do like to see my queens [Ify] I'm like, [Ify] Like, give us narrative. [Ify] I know this is slowly building into you getting a [Ify] What will help is [Ify] I know you're trying to play [Ify] No. Uh, go ahead because I'm so sure that are using these aesthetic videos as, - &quot;This is what it should be like.&quot; [Ja] So, I feel like we would be remiss - before we wrap this episode. *- [Ja] Um... [Jo] That's the talking - [Jo] You said you like feedback. [Ja] The feedback is not - [Ja] You figure it out. [Ja] First off, for those - [Ja] Dropout is a subscription service. [Ja] Very, very cool service that has lots of shows [Ja] Um... I don't even [Ja] And one of - [Ja] It's a trivia show. [Ja] It's like a trivia panel show; [Ja] Um, Jordan and myself were on - with Sad Boyz guest Demi Adejuyigbe. [Ja] And it is hosted by Ify, [Bri] Correct. [Ja] So, what has that [Ja] You just finished your first season. - [Ja] Things are airing now. and we are currently in the [Ify] Yeah, we finished back in November. [Ify] Y'all were actually the which was funny looking at the comments. [Ify] Everyone's like, You could tell they got it.&quot; I'm like, [Ify] Like, we finally hit our groove. [Ify] And, you know, it is funny, but it has been an interesting because, like Brian said, don't read the things [Ify] For some reason, I read... comments like I pull Magic cards, where I'll go, &quot;A good one? OK, This one's good. - [Ja] I have my eyes squinted. if I read one that upsets me, I stop there, instead of I know - and let it hit. [Ify] I read until I get the bad one, [Jo] It'd be like if every - [Ify] Yeah, I know. [Jo] You just kept doing it. - [Jo] &quot;I don't know why I'm doing this!&quot; your episode is the current favorite [Ify] Not &quot;that stinks.&quot; - [Ify] Going to the reddit stinks. - [Bri] It was pretty low-energy. [Ify] I think it also helped - so everyone was locked in. [Ify] But, you know, the Discord is dead, but the Discord, I think people [Ify] 'Cause I would pop in when people would be like, any WWE questions when Xavier was there.&quot; [Ify] I was like, &quot;Well, let me [Ify] You know, just fun BTS stuff. [Ify] But I could tell the convers-- but I'd ignore it and talk to that person. [Ify] But now, Reddit, they know I'm there and don't care. [Ify] I've commented once, and no one even responded to it. to talk shit and say things,&quot; and I'm like, [Jo] Going into a games [Jo] Like, &quot;We're not - [Ify] Yeah. &quot;Fuck you.&quot; - [Ja] I was so in my head the whole time. [Ja] Yeah, and it's like... [Ja] I think 'cause I got actually mad that I kept forgetting [Ja] 'Cause I'd know and then I'd forget, [Ify] That's the trick of them, and that's [Ify] Yeah, a lot of times I would spend time figuring out, [Ify] And I would do it, when people say I give it up too easy. [Ify] So you can't tell me that Mike Trapp 'cause I got so many points. [Ify] But then if I knew it, then - because you know it. [Ja] And so I was in my head, [Ja] You know, like &quot;the show must go on&quot;? [Ja] And, uh... - [Ja] But you were so funny. - [Ja] And... - [Ja] OK, thank you. Demi was great. all of us knew each other. [Ja] That also made me [Ify] Well, that's one thing and even friends who've done the [Ify] Because there's been who didn't get the call last season. [Ify] Two things happened. [Ify] Those couches fill up [Ify] You know, Brian knows all of the and I'd be like, &quot;Oh, there's no space.&quot; [Ify] And two, we build whole couches now, - so instead of a smattering of people-- [Ify] Well, we saw it y'all and everyone who came on. It's like, since everyone knows each other, [Ify] They're more comfortable and it just made for a better show. [Ja] I'll kill Demi - [Jo] Yeah. [Jo] I feel like if I were to attack Demi, he would activate, like... Yoda mode. - [Jo] He would Revenge of the Sith Yoda. - [Bri] Is that what you're saying? [Ja] There is a framing where it's like... [Ja] There's a screencap where, you know, people think I'm short because and I'm just a little bit [Ja] And then we, I think, were and just because of the [Ja] He is not that short. - [Jo] Literally Peter Jackson-style. [Bri] I was like, &quot;We need to [Ja] &quot;Bring on Peter Jackson. - Jordan gets the Gandalf treatment.&quot; [Jo] We had to cut that - [Ja] No, it was so fun. [Ja] Your whole team, [Jo] Hell, what a production. [Ja] It's really cool to see the [Ja] And I'm excited for [Ify] Thank you. [Jo] I also loved both of your - [Ify] Oh, man, yes. [Jo] I did not know it was you when I first started seeing those clips, [Jo] Then it started blowing up and then I started to recognize and I went back and saw - &quot;Something about that.&quot; 'cause I was just like, you're and I was just losing my shit - [Ja] And then Brian, your arm. [Bri] When they gave me the arm, - [Ja] &quot;This is fun.&quot; the clip where you're and [they're] amazing. - [Bri] Vic is fantastic. [Bri] That was the thing, where I'm like, I am OK at improv. [Bri] I think I'm in the &quot;slightly better but that's partially because [Bri] There's some very bad improvisers. [Ja] I would not say you were bad at [Bri] Thank you. But when they &quot;Here's the idea, we'll put you in really &quot;I wanna do that just [Bri] But I was also like, &quot;It might not [Bri] Then they were like, and I had never met Vic, and I was like, &quot;OK, yeah. I trust [Jo] I'd heard them a ton on or did later hear them, like, &quot;OK, [Jo] But I think there's something, just like the genesis of that show is the best version of 'cause high-concept, &quot;Hey, where people come in [Jo] That does not, by any means, include &quot;and it's going to be hosted by slightly snooty character - who is very socially unaware.&quot; [Jo] On, like, a Johnny Carson-style set. [Jo] That's a genius idea, [Jo] I think in... [Jo] The fear of you and the fear of the--the frustration that [Ify] Yeah, they were like... [Ify] When doing things with Vic, they were on top of because, you know--I wonder [Ify] You're doing where you're coming up and then you sit down with Vic, and then they are meeting - [Ify] They don't know your character. [Ify] And so you're going around the bush, so that moon thing was just them kind of [Ify] And I was like, &quot;OK, this is a more fun version [Ify] And they are just so good at kind of - seeing where you're going. the reality--&quot;If this is true, [Ja] That stuff with improv when someone's really got it - and really locked-in. Um... [Jo] Obviously, there's the satisfaction of delivering a really good joke or landing the flight. [Jo] But then there's also the exactly the ramp they are the best at, and that is, like... [Jo] Everything I've seen of their show-- [Jo] Obviously I don't see but everything I see in the cutdown - [Jo] Throwing to a photo-- [Bri] There's a reason why, like, they're like, &quot;Don't film this, [Ja] Yeah, like someone's [Bri] &quot;Don't do that.&quot; is that I'm like, &quot;The only people [Bri] They are the only people [Bri] It is a skill. [Bri] Even in improv shows, maybe not the best improvisers, where it's like, &quot;And stop! [Bri] If you have someone who's really [Ja] In improv it's called the &quot;edit,&quot; - but now you have an actual edit. [Jo] Does it help you guys at all that-- [Jo] It feels like Dropout, has kind of a house style, to some extent? [Ify] Oh, yeah. I definitely think so. [Ify] You know, and they [Ify] And I think what makes it work is everyone kind of steers their own ship. [Ify] So when they hit me up I kinda was like, and as someone who likes going to and also be able to do things,&quot; I was like, &quot;Well, and I would personally wanna [Ify] And they were like, &quot;It's your show. If you wanna do live stuff--&quot; [Ify] So I always hit up Brian, [Ify] It's funny, because &quot;Ify's the con guy who [Ify] It is very fun getting to, one, travel with Brian, bring Brian to cons, but also realizing how much Brian &quot;Thanks, Ify, Brian [Bri] No, yeah. I don't go to cons. [Bri] That's from a personal - [Bri] I'm just not great with it. [Bri] But, that being said, Ify did, two months ago was like, &quot;I'm thinking of and I was like, &quot;Finally, I have an 'cause I don't know a [Bri] And then in the past month, Actually, I do wanna go to Las Vegas - for a con for Magic.&quot; [Bri] Three things that I - in my whole life, ever. and I was like, &quot;I never wanna go back.&quot; [Ja] And then Em was like, and I was like, &quot;I'm in.&quot; [Ja] Then Vegas, and I was like, [Jo] Aimlessness does make crowds [Jo] It feels like you can't [Ify] I've told you this privately, and also to Jarvis, who might be in Vegas. [Ify] You always feel free to lean on [Ify] 'Cause I'm real because I'm so big. - We're out of here.&quot; [Bri] I mean, Ify but Ify also can book it. [Bri] So I was just scooting [Bri] It was beautiful. I'm getting into things like Magic. that either I was &quot;I already have this list of but I am getting back into sewing, [Bri] But I'm also like, Only if it's a masked character.&quot; [Bri] And then I'm going to New York [Bri] Like, I just wanna go and because that is where I would have fun, except for MagicCon, &quot;I wanna buy every single one [Jo] &quot;I can't have this mask [Ify] I'm so stoked to see [Ja] That's what's really cool about [Ja] Yu-Gi-Oh, I don't know if they [Ja] But, um, Pokemon, the artists are allowed but they're not allowed to do [Ja] But with Magic, - of the art on the cards. the proofs, which are the early kind - and they usually do the other side. [Ify] Yeah. I'm like, oh, - there's so much cool stuff. - [Jo] I'll come. I'll go to MagicCon. [Jo] Take out my Family Blade. - [Ify] Yes. [Ja] OK, gang.
