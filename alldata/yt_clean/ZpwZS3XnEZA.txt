You are about to learn about the popular course from university professor Burton Paulson your data for actionable insights. Welcome to SPSS course, we're going to look at these statistical and give you an idea of what it can do and Now, SPSS, the name deserves a little bit for a statistical package for the social sciences. One important thing to know is how popular comes from the excellent website are for of scholarly articles published in 2015, using And we can see here is right at the top is SPSS scholarly research. Also, you can look at jobs. stats Comm. And what this shows is analytics one major source of tech jobs, SBS is on the list, it's number six. And so there is a difference in analytics. Really what this tells you something the primary audience of SPSS is academic but in other fields like business. Now, there's Number one, it's user friendly. It's kind you to assemble code really quickly. You can And then you can reuse it, you can adapt it really well adapted for data from experiments, analysis of variance, several important options And so those are some of the reasons for SPSS is In some who can say a few things. Number one, is still popular. It's got an easy to use the syntax, giving you a code basis The first thing we need to talk about in SPSS ready to do the work. To do that, however, we additions and modules, which all refer The choice is really making me think of an of you. And it's nice to break it down a little versions, those are the release updates, the vary according to what's included in a particular can get to add on to the abilities of SPSS. We'll out in 1968. And at that point, it was called SPSS version 24 came out in 2016. And now it's stand for anything. Now for this course, I'm using there haven't been any extraordinarily major I'm going to show you in this course will work Now, it is possible that you've heard of was briefly called predictive analytics software. by IBM, it only lasted for a year or so and it no matter what version you're using, the files And so code that you created in version 16 is backwards compatibility issues for advanced But most of it is consistent all the way through. And there are a few major choices here. the Professional Edition The premium edition. the functions that are included with each edition. you get linear regression, you get clustering standard adds on to that logistic regression, It also adds drag and drop interactive Data Prep, forecasting decision trees, the top of the line premium edition of exact tests and structural equation modeling. And Now, this is the product pricing as of that SPSS starts in the base at $1,170 per And it goes all the way up to nearly $8,000 per However, I want to say this, don't panic. you know, sell your house to get SPSS. And you can download SPSS and you can try it to do this is see if you can make a business There is also academic pricing student pricing the super duper version, but it is absolutely research. Now, we also need to talk about modules. functionality to SPSS. And they're the things that modules of rephrase the available bootstrapping categories, and complex samples, can trees, direct marketing, exact tests, forecasting, So that's 14 additional modules. And this sounds 9000 packages that are available for our, there is that these packages, they cost money, so you need there are also free plugins that make it and the Microsoft dotnet framework within SPSS. So what you need. In some way we can say this. SPSS goes, there are several variations and additional additions that you can make to it by adding extra so it's something to consider when you're The next step in SPSS an introduction and and seeing what the program's like. And the When you first open SPSS, you'll get this an opportunity to open up some files, recent files get from SPSS. If you want to, you can click on then you won't have to deal with it And that brings you to the data window in SPSS, It has these rows and columns, where you have But there's a very important differences between I want to open up a data And then when this opens up, you see that it does across the top, we have row numbers down the important difference between SPSS is data window but you also have something called a variable on it, we see it in a different way. Each of the instance age, it tells you the time type of the a string variable. But you can see there's a lot You also can specify the width of the variable, important thing that makes SPSS different from column right here shows variable labels. And the over here on the left. And if you use a very eight characters. And you ended up with sometimes same restrictions anymore. But what's common And then to give it a label, that is more labels. So let's come here to marital and we that in that column zero means unmarried and make them whenever you want. And when you come So I'm going to come right up here. And will show the value labels, and you see how There were the variables, if I just Going back to Variable View, you can also give the width of the column, the alignment, and And then you can specify the level of measurement. a interval or ratio level measured variable which is categories, you also have the option of a target variable, or both. And there are certain that's not a big deal. And you see that in this at all. So the first window in SPSS is this So for instance, let's make a very quick graph, and make a histogram of age. and hit OK. And so drag and drop menus that allows me to assemble get is a another window that opens up, it's super And this is the output window. So it's a separate an analysis, you get a separate output window, And what this one does is it has the graphs or any contents over here that you can collapse things is I've got it set. So it shows the code that analysis. And the nice thing about that is you can directly. This code is called syntax in SPSS. Now, an output window. But you can get a syntax window up to File, New, and syntax. And this is a very Or you can also use the drop down menus to put a to the recent command. And I did it histogram. going to do is I'm going to press a paste. the code for that chart. And it's going to put it And if I select that, I can hit Run, it runs the selection, and you'll see we get the thing a second time. But this time it did it from lot of people are uncomfortable with syntax, and important thing about this is it allows you to without having to go through all the menus. You into a syntax file, and then you can repeat it as modify things when you do it that way. And syntax with a dot SPSS extension, but they read Just important elements of the SPSS environment, the View, the output windows and the syntax windows what gives SPSS both some of its flexibility and moving back and forth between these various both with the drag and drops and by typing of flexibility and power in SPSS looking to allow insight you want from your data. We'll continue in SPSS by taking a look at the sample data The really nice thing about that is it with things and see how SPSS works. The hard And so you need to know where to Now, if you're on a Macintosh like I am, then under IBM SPSS Statistics 22 or whatever version then you'll have them. In Windows, it's a little IBM SPSS Statistics 22, or whatever So you have to navigate to that manually in you'll see a bunch of files there. Now, there's There are the dot s, a V files. These are they can only be opened up in SPSS. Usually, syntax files. There are text files with the graphs and other functions in SPSS. Now, we can open up the window, and opening up a file called When you navigate to the folder with the SPSS layers down. These are the files that you'll find the dot SPSS syntax files. Now there are other plan. That's an analysis plan. There's an XML But the majority of what we want to deal with, in to deal with are the dot shp files, and possibly we find demo dot Save. Now, please note, there's this one in particular demo dot shp because that's And SPSS opens up the file. Now you can set SPSS, or you can have multiples, I'm going But here is our demo file. And this allows us see how they work. In fact, I'll be using this because it allows you to do a number of analyses it all set up. So I'll show you a very quick one And I will get level of education and put that in. work with. These are all the same variables, just opens up microscopically here in the top corner. to start working with my sample data. And that how the functions work in SPSS and to try some Our next step in SPSS and introduction is to look first step in analysis. And the easiest way to do templates. Really, you can just think of these you set the levels of measurement in SPSS, be appropriate for those variables. Now in terms Number one is nominal for different and number three is scales, that's for And then when you're in the graph board you have basic graphs. And those are where to graph. And then SPSS will show you suggested There's also an option for detailed and this is you choose the variables that go into it. Now, forth between the two tabs, and it'll be easiest if you're logged into data lab.cc, then you from the same page that this video is on, open underscore one underscore graph board dot SPSS Syntax file that you've opened, looks kind I want to have a written record of the same and drop menus and the graph board, we do need depending on whether you're on a Macintosh or on a little bit different. And also depending And so if you're using something else changed that And you can run this command and open up the that, I'll show you. There's my data set right down here to Variable View. And see the levels of of them are scale, we have a few that are ordinal, truly coded as nominal. And that's gender, which I'll go back to this index. Now, I have some rather complicated syntax here. it's actually pretty simple. The first thing going to come up here to graphs to the graph board I'm in this tab of basic graphs, and this is where here. And it recommends three different kinds of with a normal distribution. We'll take the very It puts it in the output window, which I have looks a lot like a histogram of aging year. So it about 7778. And it's an easy way to get a feel of the command in text and syntax is complicated. to do. Go back to the syntax for a moment. If you is what you would see right here. And this way of Now we'll do a histogram of age with Again, I'll come up to graphs, graph board have to do is come over to the right, I click Expand the output window. And it's really simple. Now both of those charts that I showed you scaled variable in SPSS terminology, we can also gender and make a bar chart, hit GRAPH board template chooser. And when Recommended Charts change because this Now, if I had GPS data, I could put that in I'm just gonna do a bar chart because that's Make the output window bigger. There's particular data set, we have an almost exactly Now, those are the basic charts where you choose graphs. You can also do detailed charts. These are then you fill in the variable. I'm going to do you that it's really easy to modify it, come This time, I'll go to the detailed tab, click So I'm going to scroll through this, you see that's going to ask what I want to make a dot going to scroll to income. See, the one that I I can click OK. then expand the output window. you see that most of the people are at is hundreds of 1000s of dollars. So that's But I want to show you an interesting thing that opens up the Edit window, and the For one thing, I can change the number of come to format and change the minimum level, or That's better. But the more interesting one is, as points and the modifier is to pile them, there is to dodge them. And what that does is it puts it might be a little harder to make comparisons kind of chart, I can click on it again. And distribution, and that takes points with the same up and down. And again, you can see that One other choice is jitter uniform, which makes hard to tell really how much things are spread pile or I think dodge is interesting in this case. set it up and then to manually modify can close this because I'm done with that. And Now, we can get a lot more complicated. So age and income with colors for point and you can explore them. This time, I'm going select this command. And again, the way I got simply hitting paste, and it put this index run it later. So I'm going to show you how that using the graph board template chooser. And And I maximize that window. And there you can see And it's showing a few different things. And options on the way you display things in the code is complicated, the interaction with the you can get different views on your data and try The next step in our introduction to SPSS like bar charts for a very simple reason. They are bar charts are the most basic graphic for the most It's also a very basic command in SPSS. Now, kinds of bar charts. One, we can make a simple the category frequencies in that variable, too. down by some other variable. And then three, simultaneously. But let's try this in SPSS, it's file, and we'll give it a whirl. Once you've data set and we've used it before. This is the is the command for Windows if you're running 22 Once you have the file open, we're going to make up here to what are called the legacy dialogues. dialogues that come from earlier versions of SPSS. them so quick and easy to deal with, what we're levels of education in our sample. So I'm gonna And we'll do groups of cases. And all I need to do is hit level of education, And I make the output bigger. There it is, absolute Piece of cake. And it's also very, very it's really could be one line. And just chart produced with the chart builder. But overwhelming code, the legacy chart produces chart, Piece of cake. Now let's do a clustered levels of education by gender. To do that, we And now we're going to cluster it into a level get level of education, that sort of our and then define clusters by gender, And make it bigger. And this time, it uses nicer broken down where women are in blue, and men the relationship between the two variables. looks like there's no substantial difference I believe this is an artificial data set. But this is a nice way to compare them. By the this is really simple. All it does is it adds I'm going to go back to the syntax. And we're multiple variables. So this is a situation a lot of categories within each variable. What variables or the numbers of ones. If you have an this is a really nice way of comparing across. I'll show you how that works. We'll And we're going to do a simple one. But this Then I'm gonna come down here and this data asked a lot of people about various things wireless service. And we're going to come down to old data. And it's asking about old technology select all those variables, I put them in here. going to do the mean of each one. And on the 01, And there we have it, it's a way multiple variables simultaneously. It's a very you're the analysts are exploring your data, of getting a feel for your data, which As we continue to look at basic graphics in this is a graphic for data that is quantitative those really all are referring to basically you're going to want to make a histogram to see SPSS prefers the terms scale for these variables. And I like to think of it as the scales of point is to see what you have to see what the data that you're going to be looking for. Number one, distribution, is it uni modal, bi modal skewed, This suggests that maybe you have some important you would need to take consideration of before there are a lot of different things that you have a lot of influence on your analyses. So it's will give you a great impression of a quantitative open up this syntax file, and we'll see how it just to open up the data set is the same one we've the code for Mac, adjust the version number if But once you have the data set open, you simple. All you need to do is come up to graphs, here to the bottom to histogram. And we're going and I come to age, it's our first variable. And Make the output window bigger. And there's our distribution is uni modal, we can see it's pretty end, but not very much. And this is going to be because it means most of the assumptions of the Now if I want to make things because you see that the command we can make a small modification I'll show you And all I have to do for that is come back And I just checked this box right here display going to create the same distribution, we're bell curve, a normal distribution that And here you can see, we're pretty close to And again, the code for it is really simple. sentence, and that gives us everything like the legacy dialogues in SPSS, is and it gets you what you need. So you can As we continue SPSS and introduction in basic common method of looking at associations, or as I in data. In other words, you want to see what variable goes with what other variable. the association between two quantitative there are some things you should look for. And in for instance, whether the association between the procedures that are common, assume that you want to check the spread of the data, go from left to right, on a scatterplot. That's problems with certain procedures. You want to look that's unusual on a single variable by itself. Or, variant where you have an unusual combination of some idea for the correlation or the strength his counterpart will allow you to do all of kinds of scatter plots that you can do. Number easy to do. Number two is a matrix scatterplot, and they're simultaneously. And it's a good collections of variables. And number three, SPSS words to say about that a little bit later. But SPSS, at least very basically. So just open up When you open up the syntax file, we have the we'll use demo dot save. And you can use this And this command on Windows version 22. But plots and it's a really basic, easy command. scatterplot of age and income, let's come up to want to use a simple scatter, that's just a And all I need to do here is pick my and the y axis of the side, we're going to And household income for the y axis. And the household income and how old the person is. And when I get that, I get this basic scatterplot. I have household income and 1000s of this side. people are near the bottom. That's because most goes up to 1.2 million. We have a marker that's change the markers. And there's things you can do the people who for instance, make a lot of money there is some kind of association between nuanced one by looking at several variables Come back up to graphs and legacy This time, however, I'm going to pick matrix is pick the variables I want to include, I don't to serve as both x and y in different parts I'm going to get household income, I'll move Okay, address yours at current address and move of people residing in the house, move that. There's nothing especially meaningful about these, look at. Now, as a general recommendation, if you you might want to put that one in first, first row. And it makes it easier to find But I've got my five variables in takes a moment. And then I come up. And this all five variables listed on the side, you bottom. So each one functions as both an X and because that would be each variable with there are things you can do to clean this up, you something that's smaller and easier to see you to see that there's some really important and years at current address right here, someplace longer than you've been alive. That's But you do see some associations and some cut dense in a lot of situations, it's going to be especially if you change the markers and put of what you can do with a scatter plot matrix. dialogues and to scatter, because you saw that that's like a histogram. And there's an overlay there's a 3d scatter. And you might look at that it's a great thing. I'm actually not even going to I found it, it's impossible to read it clearly. ends up being really a bad experience. And it's variables using a scatterplot matrix. That's why even though it's available here. But avoid the scatterplot matrices as a way of looking at Once you've done the basic graphics for your data idea to move on to basic statistics. And in SPSS, I like to think of it as putting things into buckets. So the idea is when you have a limited just count how often each category occurs. It's But wait, I just want to mention in SPSS can do so much more than that. And I'm it can do charts. It can do bar charts and pie And they can do a lot of statistics beyond mean, median, mode, standard deviation, because of this, I like to think of frequencies in literature and movies, who can do everything or Iron Man who seems to be able to do everything, won two Nobel prizes, and one of the rest of us a look at frequencies and let's try it in SPSS. things that it's able to do for you. As always, use demo dot save. And you can use this command Once you have the data set open, it's a Now I have the syntax saved here. But really, it's the drop down menus to create these commands. I'm going to get the frequencies for gender and two descriptive statistics. And then And what I'm going to get is gender. Just right here, I'll just double click to move click and move that over. Now, what's important Gender is a categorical variable, nominal. And normally, you don't do the same kinds of things So I'm just going to hit OK, and we'll The first thing that it shows us is how many cases have data on these variables? The answer And then it comes down. And it gives us frequency score on the variable, and then says how often female respondents, that's 49.7%. And the percent missing data. But we don't, so we can ignore that. And then job satisfaction. This is a scaled And here you can see how many people put each neutral and 19.1 highly satisfied. And that we're dealing with. It's a nice way also But what we can do is more than that, we can also using the frequencies command. So I'm going job satisfaction. But this time, I'm just going commands and frequencies. And what I'm it's going to give me a little error message I'm going to come to charts right here. you can make pie charts and histograms as And now the same general command but it's producing charts. And here mess in terms of the number of And here you can see job satisfaction sort of a really nice thing. You don't even have to use You can also get more kinds of statistics I'm going to keep the tables off when I'm going to come back to this one. We're going to analyze, I'm going to do age, reside and job set. So I'm Just reset that I'll do age or And then I think that's this one right here. And we'll move that over. So I have three What I'm going to do here is first And I have a really an impressive range of get the median, the mode, if you want the mode, I can get core tile values. Now it doesn't do those separately down here. But you can also get The quartiles are cut point, it splits the data of people in each. Sometimes you want something if you're doing propensity scores, it's not And also, there are situations in which you most. And so I'm going to put, for instance, because those frame the middle 95% of the and the variance sentence or anything else I I'm gonna hit continue, then I'm going to off the frequency tables, because otherwise, I I'd have a lot going on. I'll hit charts. And we'll put a normal curve on top of each And so here's what we get. It starts with variables I selected, it gives us the mean, and standard error of Skewness kurtosis. then the percentiles. Now it's a funny list here, the core tiles, that's something I asked for. So and the 75th percentile. Those are the core tile So those are the zero and 100% courthouse, but I 20 4060 and 80%. And then finally, I manually and then 97 and a half percent. And so they're all the changes in the distribution. Beneath that has its own histogram, along with a normal deviation laid on top age is pretty close to you can see is really skewed because most people job satisfaction is a little flatter than we would of this is that I'm able to do a tremendous amount command the frequencies function in SPSS, one In our previous movie, we looked at the power of another very common choice is descriptives within allows you to achieve maximum density. That is in just a little space. That's what descriptives a restriction, it works only with numerical you might have. And if you have that, it can give deviation, the standard error, the variance, and kurtosis. Now, I say that Guess what, you does more, but that's okay. There's certain here's what it does well, first, it gives So it's really easy to see a bunch Second, it's a really quick way to find you can get proportions for indicator variables Also, we have a bonus feature here in of SPSS is top secret hidden one step Z score out trying to get z scores by getting standard of that you click one button and you're done. it works. Just open up this syntax file, and We'll begin as always, by opening the dataset, a Macintosh, it running version 22. And the path my first command, and it looks really long. But All we need to do is come up to analyze, to We click on that. Now one of the things it does analyze. So gender, which was a string variable, But what I can do is I can just select all of move everything over. And then I'm just going And here's our output. We have and it tells us first, the number of way down this question about internet is missing we have the minimum value and the maximum value. easy data checking. If you have a variable that's one, if you have a 17, you know something's wrong. that's a fast way seeing if there are any really standard deviation to the things, you generally And so that's a lot of information. And it's in If we go back to the syntax, I do want to mention earlier, is this. If you have indicator variables only two possible values, and if that variable get the mean of it, and it tells you something that have once. And this works best if you use the no. And one equals true or Yes. And strangely, most of the variables, but not the last one or switch that. But it's something that you want to So if I go back to the output, you can see for through owns fax machine, those are all zero ones here tells us that 99% of the people own TVs, that 25% had paging services. And I like 27% of the internet because this was apparently Anyhow, those are meaningful data points, the I'll go back to the syntax here. And scores. Now any reasonable person would the data and therefore it would be under the Instead, it's hidden as an option and unless you age in income, I'm going to pick age. And I'm going to pick these z scores because a lot of procedures work to do is this. Click Save standardized What it's done here is it gives me the ran the descriptives command for those let's take a look at the data set. When I come I have two variables that age, pansy income, and they have lots of Now, I'm refreshed. Now under normal into the data. I'm not going to do that because But I do want to show you that we can do get descriptives for those z scores. So I'm going to reset this Come down to see our two to get both of them and pop them over here, then has a mean of zero, and a standard deviation we didn't have to remember any values, we didn't And so that is what the descriptives command And it also allows you to save standardized For a final look in SPSS at basic statistics, I like to think of this as a way to get a lot get closer and see what's there in detail. you a bunch of statistics, it can give you the And the trimmed mean, as well as the variance, the minimum and maximum, the range skewness. which are special robust ways for percentiles, which we've seen before, and lists plots. It's the one place in SPSS that you can those are things that are drawn by hand. So You can also get box plots, And you can get a set of normality plots, And the neat thing after that is you can break try it in SPSS and see how it works. Just open up procedures and explore and see how it can add by opening the demo dot save data set. Here's the Now, again, I'm saving this as syntax that can download it and try running it on your own. Let's start by doing a default explore analysis analyze, to descriptives, and then we'll come over and income category. And again, this is kind of of variables. Age is a scalar variable. ordinal variable. I'm just going to leave And here's what we get from this. were any missing cases there weren't in this descriptive statistics for these we have we have the mean with the standard error, the median, variance, standard deviation, minimum and kurtosis, along with their standard errors. So down we find the same kinds of information some of this you wouldn't normally want to is not a scaled variable. And a lot of these best with a scale variable. But SPSS is able to caution. Then we come down and look we have a in our sample is two digit numbers. And so this numbers over here is the leaf that represents we have about 640 numbers right here. And you common late 30s. And that we go up to somebody to see what's going on. Simultaneously, we as you can tell really quickly if there are no We do the same thing with income category. but that's because there's only a few possible it's drawing it so it looks a little weird. well and see there's no outliers, at not normally something you would do with a Now the neat thing is there are additional But I'm going to go check off a lot of options dialog, I'll go to explore. What I'm going statistics right now. And I'll come up here, although 95% confidence intervals I have seen significant situations where so you can change it if you want. Then I can get I can get a list of outliers and a list of And now we have the same table we had before. then we have the M estimators. And this is Again, all of them are trying to give us something huber's estimator, turkeys by weight the numbers are all pretty similar. I mean, it to four, they're all really close. And each of you can't adjust them in the dialog box. But You see here, these are the parameters for each of you want to do. I'll go back to the output. Then it gives us the case numbers for the highest and a really nice way of seeing a multi dimensional and even better ways to do this with more graphs. And you see that we can get some additional plots, But I'm going to change that what it tells us. plots, we're not going to get any statistics, we have a stem leaf by default, let's get a a way of assessing how closely your data match a Now I have a histogram for age, the stem But this one here is new. It's a normal qq And if it were normally distributed, all of You see, it's really close, but it does deviate line sort of flattens it out, and it's much easier really big in this case, but this variable is Then we have our boxplot. And then we do the our stem and leaf plot. And a little weird, because there's only four possible well on the line. And there's our D trended plot. Now there's one more thing we can do with the of these analyses and break them down by groups. going to do income and break it down by gender. And I'm going to reset this. And we're our dependent or outcome variable list or the then we'll take gender scroll down a little bit, sometimes people call it independent variable. variable for the predictor variable. I'm going the statistics and get plots only. I don't want get the normality plot. And now because I'm spread versus level with Levine's test. The out approximately the same amount for each of the statistics. I'm going to do what's called a power And now what we get is, again, is a list of the all of them do that With no missing data, see here is based on both of these, that That's okay, because we knew that As for homogeneity of variance, whether the two you know, there is some difference, but they appears to be the same for the men and the women, then we can come down and see the histograms first skewness there. And the same thing, again, for men or quantile quantile plots. And again, if it would fall right on this line is strongly skewed. The same is true for men. And here's the flat on that lines too, as you get this swoosh not dealing with normally distributed data of outliers in the box plots, I'm going to do And then I'm going to come right up to here. can get rid of the ID numbers. And you can demand and both the women and there's no really And the spread versus level plot is something that it can help you select a a square root or reciprocal, a square, something and something for another day. And besides, variance in the two groups. So we'd be good to go of the options and explore. And that's where we can see how they can be used to see how well that you use, and then really, how well you can When you're working in SPSS, one of the most important things you can do is I like to think of this as the statistical asking her to explain herself, you need to explain your data, you need to tell SPSS, what do your and I see two kinds of information that you going to call semiotics, which comes from the what the variable names are the data types, the missing values, the level of measurement, and that there are other elements that even call decimal places, column width, and alignment. And SPSS. One of the most important though, at the variable and value labels. And so I'm going with the variable names. That's what the short of the column, there are some important Number one, the names must be unique. No two be too surprising. It's an identifier. Rule I put an asterisk there because you can but you don't want to because those are generally Rule number three names can use letters, upper or period underscore at pound dollar sign, on the cause confusion with the command Terminator. And for automatic variable names when SPSS is doing include spaces. And rule number five names must be that 64 characters, but if you're using a And the last rule rule number six is the names e, lt and E not or two or with Because those so don't create that confusion. So those are the On the other hand, the label that you associate Those are the variable labels. And so there they must be less than 256 bytes. That actually usually want to do that, because some procedures and you really want to be able to read what it longer if you need to. Rule number two, the labels they need to be straight quotes, the vertical on those. Rule number three labels can include any that you can't have the variable name, but you can sort of float on top of the variable names. they can show up in the charts in the output value labels. So you may have a variable called remember what those zeros and ones are. And so I'm The most important thing is to put value labels Rule number one, they must be less than 121 bytes. want to keep your labels pretty short. Rule number must be enclosed in quotes, and they need to Rule number three labels can include any This is an interesting one. And rule number four, is more than one value can have the same label. And it could be that 789 all say the same thing. situations where you might want to do that. But So just open up this syntax file. And this one's not going to use a data file, I'll refer to one This index file shows how to write variable labels to put them all broken down in lines, I do it's a lot easier to see what's going on. The Because it's an SPSS command, it's written on all short name of the variable. And then you have at and then the long label. So here, for instance, variable. And then this is its label written out. need any commas or question marks or semi colons put it into another line, because that makes it I'm going to make one important recommendation. If has only two possible values, and gender might that you coded as zeros and ones. A lot of people coded as zeros and ones, and named the variable male and female, I generally give one to whichever my main outcome variable, so it'll switch around. to have a higher score on an outcome variable, be are for respondent is male. On the other hand, then I will call the variable female and the label of those two. Now here are some other examples. or really just q for question q one q two, and I in the dialog boxes. And when you're done listing and quotes, just end with a period doesn't have earlier versions of SPSS. It's a habit I have. So these labels to the variables and then they'll Next are the value labels. And what you have in all caps. And then you give a list And you can list them out separately, very without a leading zero. And then if they're they can actually specify ranges vair, three, two, And then you just go to the next line, and then I give zero equals No, and one equals put a slash, so it knows you're done then you can go on to the next variable. I said, to men, I would call it male. And so zero, which in one, yes, they are or true, that would be male, the other way, and then you just call it female not female, they're male, one means they are fine. And then I could have a rating variable, say, for just a rating scale. And I could do rate 01, to is a five point scale from strongly disagree or maybe you have a different kind of scale. Here That's an 11 point scale, but I only mark the two at all 10 is always completely. And then to let and with a period. So this is actually a how you want the numbers to appear, both in the Finally, I'll mention something about easier to specify these in syntax, the command of the variables and you can use two in the same that is assigned to missing values. 99 is can do a slash if you're going to use different And here I say two through high. And really what is missing. So if I accidentally type in a seven, several different values, I can put seven comma those would be considered missing values, do them automatically from analyses. But it will that output finished with a period. And then you And it's going to do a lot to clarify your data reconstitute your work in the future. When you're you may get the idea of entering data. Well, data in SPSS, I just see it as an exercise in I'd say maybe you're entering 10 or 12 numbers, often referred to as a toy data set. Maybe you and paste data, but I'm gonna say sort of because It's much, much easier to just import I'll show you how to do that in the next let me show you how it works in SPSS, we'll it. So here's a blank data window in SPSS, I And, you know, unfortunate if I press tab, it And you see it gives it an automatic variable I actually need to move the right arrow key. And then I can hit return, and it goes down. I'll it comes back to the beginning. So it's not the it these generic names. That's because you can't Instead, what you have to How to get there by just double Here we go. And you can enter the variable name It works, but it's a pain. I'm going to come can important data sort of. So let me show you a Google Sheet that has nothing in it at the I have a few different kinds, I'll do Okay, so there's some data, I've letters, which will be string variables And we'll see how well they paste over I'll come over here to the side. And I will paste showed up with decimal places, and I can get rid variable with the letters and so you can copy I still have to enter those in manually, you can is a demonstration that putting stuff manually in spreadsheet, use Google Sheet, use numbers, use it. I'll show you that in the next section. And The last thing I want to say in SPSS about you know, compared to entering it manually, it cheesy clipart to show how happy I am. Because best way to go if you want to get data into SPSS. it can open CSV or comma separated value files, they're formatted right. Now, what do I mean Wickham in the our developer community tidy data It says that your file should have only one sheet. more than that, that each column should be exactly equal to one case. And an important thing is no is very flexible. And when I refer to funny stuff, and graphs and formatting and comments or merge duplicating row numbers. You don't want any of file. And if you do that, then you find you can let me show you how this works. We're going things. First, I want you to download the course this name that ends with data sets, that's going in just a second. And then you can also open But let's go to see what's inside the folder and The folder that I've asked you to download the folder here, and I have the three files saved inside it. But for the syntax to work properly, All three of them contain the same data. It says because this is Google Trends data about the composers names since 2004. This first one The second one is a plain text file, and is an XLS. x file. So it's an Excel sheet. And a little bit differently when I do the quick view is open up the syntax file. And we're going to see I've saved this syntax, but the fact is, it's I give some information here about using the I have to specify the file location. Now, this is of course, you'll want to change Bart to be on a Windows computer, you're going to need to or possibly depending on the version of your Anyhow, I'm going to show you how to import each here in the script, in case you want to run it from the menus. So here's what I'm going to I'll just click over to that. And my data window Open, and data, you do that if you're opening something in a different format. Now here, I'm you can't see the three data files I have next display files that are in the dot save. That's the on that, and come way down here. And we'll start hit that and now you can see that it's there. So now I have the SPSS text import wizard. And we asks if it matches a predefined format, something It asked if they're delimited Yes, or delimited by the top of the file, you see how they show up here those because it knows that those need to be the line represents a case, I want all of the cases data set, they would allow you to do exploratory And that's what delimiters text file, the one that I have uses tabs and I don't have text qualifiers in here. So I just Now I have dates here at the beginning, and they however, it doesn't like the fact that I'm using Consequently, I'm gonna leave it just And it still works properly in any analyses hit continue, I'm not changing anything here. future use. That's the thing I was referring to to paste the syntax, I could do that. But I've And there it is, it's opened it up, and it's you can see it's got a string variable, it's number of digits, it has the proper number of no which actually is not the case. So I actually need Because the data that you get from Google Trends relative popularity, search terms, change Now, let's do the same thing, but with a CSV file. file, I'll just open up a new one. There we go. This time, I need to tell I'm looking for under text. So I click here. And except this I'll select the dot CSV file. And what you find only one super tiny change here. I hit Continue. It is delimited. and nice to know that each line the one difference. When I did the text file tab CSV, which means comma separated values, comma is the same thing with month we're going to leave And you see, it looks exactly the same. I do numbers which go from zero to 100, are coded as Right. Now we'll do the third one, an you get very stern warnings about importing Because Excel files are very flexible, and people and changing column widths and merging cells that information. But if you're importing it don't want data already. columns are the same as variables, in there. And so what I can do in this case And this time I come down to this one, There it is, I'll hit open. And you'll see It says opening Excel data source instead variable names from the first row that's checked, And it's got this thing about maximum width, I And that was that. Here's the data from Excel, it's the same data, I still need to you could save this information in syntax if But that is sufficient for the need. And so it is really easy. And it's massively more efficient You do it in a spreadsheet. And especially if you manually, you can collaborate on it. And then you And then you can get straight to your analysis. And now in SPSS and introduction, we get to and that's analyzing data. All mentioned. However, analyzing data, because we have an entire also data visualization in SPSS. And I recommend available, we'll talk about a procedure that's of And that's hierarchical clustering. Now, the you're trying to find the clusters in your data. whether similar cases cluster together in some way The trick, however, is that And there's a few decisions that you have to make So for instance, you have to decide whether you're which goes from one group to as many groups as a set K or set number of clusters. You also have going to use Euclidean distance, which is sort between cases is very common as his squared There's also the question of whether you want to in a divisive procedure, or start with everything procedure. By default, some programs does agglomerative, you basically end up so it's really not a huge difference. but we're going to try to keep it simple. We're doing this will use Euclidean distance or we'll use hierarchical clustering where we don't And we're going to use an agglomerative procedure gradually puts them together. Well try this There is a folder that you can download from the there's one file, it's cars dot save word SAE is that, there is the SPSS syntax file and you'll If you save the data file to your desktop, on it and it will open up in SPSS, you also It depends on your operating system. This is for computer though, you may need to use backslashes. I'm just gonna go back and double And there's my data set. What this data set m t cars. That's in the default data sets package cars from 1974, from the magazine Motor Trend. And this information, we're going to see whether the I'll go to the data view here. And you can see we 450, se, Lincoln, continental and so on cars And we have information about miles per gallon. and cubic inches horsepower, weight in tons, Whether it's an automatic or manual transmission, And the number of carburetors are I'm going to turn on the labels. Only one variable is I formatted this for SPSS by adding labels little easier to work with in the program. Once we have the data open, we want to do a the code to produce it right here. But I'm show you that it's really not hard to do. And then we come down to classify. Now I cannot remember if every version of SPSS yours does. So you can follow along with this And what I'm going to do here is I'm going to take cars are. And I'm going to use that to label cases And I'm going to take all of my other variables over here. And at this moment, I'm going to change cases, that's what we want, it's going to give us I'm going to hit OK. And we're going to get a I see it sound I'll make the output window bigger us how many cases there were and there were 32. Then SPSS gives us something kind of unusual, specifies, at what point in the procedure did two don't have much use for this, except I know that there is here from three to 26, you know that as from 662 1125, and so on. Most of the time, And this, this is called an icicle plot. And various cases got dropped in with everything else. meaningless. And so truthfully, the default to me is not very helpful. In fact, it's so And I'm going to do this over menu items, I'm going to go to this analysis I don't want the agglomeration schedule, I'm going to get rid of the icicle plot. And dendogram. That means branches in Greek. So usually the most important thing you can get out And now what we have is a chart here that and it shows how they grouped together. So the Mazda RX four, and the wagon and the Mercedes they all go here together, we see So for instance, the Cadillac Fleetwood, the are all gargantuan American cars with big VAT, here at the bottom, that this one, the mazarine This is where cases are individual here on the you see how they come together in each of these And so this is a really nice way of And if you have more pixels displayed, you low resolution right here. And you can see, four groups looks like we've got a distinct right there. And so I can do something else with And what I'm going to do is I'm Now, I've done a hierarchical analysis. So I now that I've looked at the chart, for seems like give me the group membership for each I'll hit Continue. And then I'm going I hit OK. And this time, we're not going to get Let's just get that. Here it says it it to see the differences in the data files, This button, by the way, will get me over to the that got added here, for clusters for and you of these four clusters. And what you can do then and you can compare them on the the clustering here is only as valid as the data on a small number of variables. And it's using for instance, that you see them was Roddy Bora neat way of looking at the similarity between market research you can do with companies And it allows you to see what groups have and which groups you need to treat goal of hierarchical clustering analysis. And Another important procedure in SPSS when you're analysis. Now, I like to think of it as looking In this picture, what you have are shadows, those moment to figure out that you're looking down and straight out. And so in this photo, we are going the person itself to a two dimensional variation is you maintain most of the useful data, you can you can probably even tell some things about how What you've done is you've made things more dimensionality reduction, where each variable is be really problematic. You're trying to boil about the saying less is more or less equals and fewer unhelpful variables in your data set. trying to do, you're trying to extract meaning. techniques, I have one very important piece of you want to remember what is your goal? So what I'll tell you what it's not. It's not an exercise that you know how to go through all the steps with your data Because you're trying to get like factor analysis is useful insight, trying sure you don't make any obvious mistakes. But you're bound by what the data tells you about factor analysis, or really any other procedure possibilities to you as you analyze the data that's sort of a philosophical discouraging, you're going to need to download from the course from it the cars dot save dataset, this is the one And then you want to open up the SPSS syntax Now, the easiest way to open the data set be ready to go. I do have some syntax you I've got it open already. So let's We have a collection of cars listed down the gears in the transmission and carburetors. That's confession here. This is a very, very It only has nine variables other than really, you would want to have at least several before you can do this really reliably. But this to see how it's happening, and how to interpret if you look at the syntax, is we're going actually a misnomer, because it's not a factor but it's in the factor analysis command And down to dimension reduction. Remember I It's our only choice there. And what we need to to see what we can compress what goes into what so identifier. We can take the rest of these however, a lot of options here, I'm not going to do any And make the output window bigger. And here's text output of the commands that were we get something called communality. each variance. That's based on how spread out then you have a variance and the standard tells us how much of that variance is really able doing. An important one right here is the total it has created components memory said this is which well, it has profoundly different the difference has to do with which came first, truthfully, most people treat them you're using them for heuristic value, But what we have here are two components, we of the original variance of the nine variables, those numbers from right here. And you can see add up to about 87% of the variance. Now the the original variables and the two components. you can see that mpg is strongly negatively not associated with the second. But number of each. And so that's a way to start to look at certain modifications to this. In fact, I'm And we're going to start over Let's go through each of these options. First feel like I need the initial solution. So extraction. This is the actual algorithm that in the multi dimensional space. You'll see why I said this is really a principal components in many situations, maximum likelihood would principal axis factoring simply because it's I don't need to see the unrotated factor solution, plot. And that is a graph that shows me I'm going to come down here and change the maximum math, that's done, I'm going to change it to 50. Then I'm going to come to rotation, what you sometimes it's a little easier. If you rotate, there are a lot of different methods. varimax is that makes all of your axes perpendicular to each good. But truthfully, for exploratory purposes, called an oblique rotation, that allows your they don't have to be totally perpendicular. another really good choice. But it usually is for Now, here, I can get a rotated solution, want to see the loading plot. And I'm going to I'll hit Continue. We'll come down factor loadings as scores. And there might But because I'm using factor analysis for its variables to go with others, I'm actually not Then finally, options. This is where you get to set, so I don't need to worry about that. I'm going to sort it and then I'm erase small coefficients. Now I've done this of point six, under normal circumstances has this seems like a reasonable choice. very clear when we look at it. So I'm going to I've got my output here. And the first part is unit variance for each of these. That's because doing principal axis factoring. And so the math need to dwell on that one. total variance factors. And the first one accounts for a lot a fair amount also, and these are very close The scree plot, is a very simple line pot. This Now there are several different rules you can above a value of one because one is what it would variance, but that's what it brought with it, you that. And you see we have two that do a lot more down. The other rule is to look for a bend in So three is where the band is, we're justified in more involved about checking for the slope of this You can do those in another time. This is are three matrices, we get a factor matrix, a all associated with each other. And I've got a I'll come down here. The factor matrix is the it's similar in nature, it's analogous to our the going to be focusing on. The structure matrix the factors because the idea Here's the factors are called the unique and common contribution. compared to the other factors or it contributes indication of each factor is unique contribution in different situations, and they can help you going to focus on this first one. There we go, the And when we come up to the factor matrix, values with an absolute value of less than point Factor one is strongly associated with the number on factor one, and then displacement, very high, weight in tons very strong in horsepower. This is going to score heavily on factor one. factor two the quarter mile time, so the less time it the faster it is. That's because automatic or manual, you have to know manual. So these are manual transmission This is really the fast factor. And that's this one has the Cadillacs and the Lincoln's and so on. And that makes perfect sense, it's really And then if you come down here, this plot is we have factor one across the bottom, that's goes on that one displacement goes on that years and miles per gallon, obviously, you're More carburetors, more horsepower, more And that makes a lot of sense. And so this to really just these two factors, sort of how can give us a much more concise image of our that is the overall purpose of a procedure like For a final look at SPSS and analyzing data, let's take a look at one of the most useful of regression as sort of the statistical version I say that because all for one is actually Put another way, regression uses many different scores on one outcome variable. This makes it especially because there's something for everyone of it and many adaptations of regression that make data and make it a go to tool for almost any a simple version of this in SPSS. First, make sure files. It will use the cars dot save data set along with this syntax file. And when you With the code for loading the data set from the on the file cars dot save and haven't opened it And you can see is the same data set with about And several variables we're going miles per gallon, based on things like the weighed quarter, second time transmission Alright, so that should be pretty easy. What to regression. And we'll use this second option Now we need to put under dependent the outcome kind of bugs me here, because independent manipulated experiments. But our outcome variable, the thing that we're So that's mpg. Now we can take everything label, we'll take all the rest of these and we'll that we are using to predict the outcome. Now, version first. So I've put the variables in And now we get our output. And it tells us first, that it used all of these variables which is listed down here. And they were entered multiple correlation of these predictor variables really high. If you square that to get the Even the adjusted R squared, because we have We get a significance test right here, we are point 000. It's not zero all the way through, get coefficients for the individual regression significance levels that are under oh five, and is under oh five and that weight in tunt. None of none of the others matter. It simply means that same time, when they are taken as a whole, really to become a predictor. That's a wait. Now, there And SPSS gives you a lot of choices. I'm going to Now I will mention, there's a really interesting a SPSS function, it's came in a few versions ago, lot of combining and splitting up the variables. to explain how it all works. And then to interpret course where I specifically talk about analyzing And we're going to make a few choices, And we're going to make a few choices, we're makes available. Now the first one I'm going to do is I'm actually going to go from simultaneous controversial because some people in the And its risk of a type one or false positive On the other hand, in modern machine learning, use. And so it's not totally unacceptable to exploratory project like this right now, rigorous model building, but it's a nice way to I'll come just to statistics, and I'm going to intervals for the coefficients, those are nice to to get the R squared change, because a stepwise variables. And we want to see if each variable to the overall model. We could get a lot more Under plots, we can get a ton of different down here and choose the standardized residual Now there are other options as well. I could save set. I can say unstandardized predicted values, I and so forth. things I could do here and there are for right now, I'm going to skip them because I'm saving all of the steps in between Options really procedure, I'm gonna leave it at the default right And then style is a new thing that has I'm going to leave that one alone for right now, Now I've created this already, and I've OK. And you'll see that we get a different Now what we have is some code that's a little bit at a time. And find the predictive variable that put it in the model, get partial correlations here is that although we had nine predictors, significant when put into the model. They Again, what we're trying to predict is gas mileage were both statistically significant, or the And when you add on number of cylinders, it goes The analysis of variance table lets us one variable and with two predictor variables, Here are the individual coefficients along the right side. Now, because we've gone through a of these are statistically significant, because Here we have a list of excluded variables along to do with how much each of these variables is number of carburetors is highly colinear, or easily predicted by the other variables Now we come down to the residuals, I'm In an ideal world, your residuals are normally be high as they are low, and they're symmetrical. pathologically far from normal. So this is a normal p p probability probability plot of all the dots would be on the line, the diagonal observations and how far off they're, they're model is predicting really well and it appears So this is one method of developing a model. exploratory analyses, it's not something But as a quick way of sifting through a this is a nice way to do it. It lets us know for is predicted primarily by a weight, which and number of cylinders, which is associated with idea of multiple regression, again, is to use gives a lot of options for those we've looked at but there's a lot more that you can explore statistical analysis in SPSS. But for now, at some of these options and see the kind of and see what options you can use to get I want to thank you for joining And we'll conclude by giving you some next steps, once you get through this, it can be a little And it may not be totally clear where you should opportunities for you. First, of course, is preparation, on data visualization, on statistical to expand what you've learned in this introductory liked what you've learned with SPSS, you may want This statistical programming language R and the are very common powerful tools in the data They're a great way to To expand both the your employment opportunities, and so, I strongly in Python data lab. Next, we have specific courses things you can do in getting to understand your other programs. And then I'm going to mention one but it still has a fair amount of bugs and some really interesting work recently in the called j SB. It's actually pronounced Jasper, it runs very differently, I find it very easy to easy to share. It's got some tremendous advantages I suggest you check those out and see how well computing needs. That being said, there are some doesn't have a really strong and active user and like R and Python do. But if you're creative, meaning specifically topical academic conferences They often have very dedicated SPSS users, on workshops for learning more about SPSS and But no matter what you do, I'm going to encourage what you can do with SPSS in your own data work.
