Cut the f**k off, f**k you, yeah, bhai! Why? Cut the f**k off, f**k you, yeah, bhai! You celebrate Indian festival, Hindu festival? Yes. All festivals. Kasha. Kasha. I was standing here, she asked me who I was looking for. The shop's name is H. Tiwari. Seven years ago, India was very different. And now it's very different. Nice bridges, infrastructure, all over. I know my wife's family. They'll tell you, yeah. All these people live here. A lot of people are shouting, coming and going. Every two minutes, a boat is coming, a boat is going. A boat is coming, a boat is going. People are coming. Hello. Hello. Four to five Afro-guyanese came and surrounded us. Very aggressive, very angry. Hey guys, welcome back to the new vlog. My name is Tor Bashu. Right now, we are in South America's third smallest country, Guyana, which is located on the northern coast of South America. Guyana is not that big. Five to six years ago, it was the poorest country in South America. Guyana's GDP per capita was the lowest in South America, five to six years ago. And suddenly, this country became the richest country in South America. And now, Guyana is one of the top five richest countries in America. Guyana's fate changed in 2015, when more than 11 billion barrels of oil were discovered in this country. Which is the biggest oil discovery in the last 50 years of the world. Then, in 2019-20, this country started producing its own oil. This country has become the richest country in the world. In the year 2022, Guyana's GDP has grown by 62.3%, which is the highest real GDP growth in the world. And according to some measurements, Guyana is currently the fastest growing economy in the world. And due to so much oil production and export in recent years, Guyana's GDP per capita is currently 80,000 USD per capita. It is the 10th richest country in the world. And if we compare it with India, it is about 9 times richer than India. It's 8.30 in the morning, I'm walking around Guyana's capital city, Jost Town. I just left my guest house. I'm walking to a very popular local shop called Shanta Puri Shop. This is a shop that became very popular at one time. Because Virat Kohli ji and his wife Anushka Sharma ji went there for breakfast. So I'm going to that Shanta Puri Shop. Let's see what kind of shop it is. Construction work is going on everywhere in the city. The whole city is suddenly growing so fast. I'm actually at the city center of Jost Town. I'm right in the middle of the city. There are a lot of roads in the city. It's very broad. It's neat and clean. You can see. But because oil has been discovered in this country recently, and its production and export has only started recently. In the last 5 years, GDP per capita has increased so much. So people should have money. But you won't get that much money. Because all the money in this country is with the government. The government has a plan. As people told me. The people here don't have to distribute money for free. They have to get work done and distribute. They don't have to give anything for free. If they start distributing money for free, the state of this country will be like the neighboring country Venezuela. The economy will suddenly burst. So the government is slowly giving money to the public. By getting work done and developing the country. In the next few years, 5, 10, 15 years, the country is going to move forward. It's going to boom. So guys, we have reached Shanta Dapuri Shop. It's written here. Since 1956. This shop is about 70 years old. This shop belongs to the Indogainese. The Indians were brought here. Look, there's a cricket match on TV here. Cricket is the most popular sport here. So this is Shanta Dapuri Shop. People have lined up to place their orders. But let me see what they can order first. There's a big TV on top. And here are the options of what to eat. You will get a lot of Indian snacks. There's bara, pakodi, here it's called flori. There's roti, there's a burger too. Look here, you can get chole, chana, jalebi. Jalebi is of the color of emirti. There are samosas. There are barfis and sweets here. You can see. Thank you. So now I saw the menu and went to order. I didn't even know what to order. There were some names on it. I don't know much about it. But there were a lot of names on it. So I ordered. I thought I would have to go there after ordering. Self service type. Because 90% of the people here are taking parcels. They are taking food outside. That's why there are lines. But I have done a dine-in here. So I was on the line. Then I got this plate. So I ordered this roti. This is roti. Roti bolo. I ordered it in the name of wrap. But I got this roti too. Along with it, there is chana and potato curry. I couldn't understand the names of the other dishes. There were some local names here. And this is a peanut punch drink. A lot of people were taking it. So I asked what is this? They said peanut punch. Okay, let's try it. I got this much. Approximately 1000 Ghanese dollars. At present time, 1 Indian Rupees is approximately 2.5 Ghanese dollars. So let's eat it. So this is some kind of potato and chana curry. Its taste is very good. It has the taste of India. In chana and spices. So this local drink of this Shanta Koi shop, peanut punch, is very yummy and tasty. It feels like they have made a peanut shake in milk. Look at this. People's name is Dr. Balwant Singh. MBBS. Now we are walking to Gayana. The main shopping district here is the local market. It is one of the most popular places here. It is the center of Josh town. We are walking there. So while walking suddenly, Radha Krishna temple came. It is a temple like this. It looks good from outside. But I don't know if it is open inside. Mostly the temple opens in the evening when people finish their work. This is the gate. It is closed. It will be open in the evening. It may not be open daily. The temple looks very big. It is in the middle of the city. It is written Radha Krishna there. There is a big Shivling there. The population of the entire country of Gayana is approximately 8 lakhs. 8 lakhs only. And out of that, about 1.5 to 2 lakh people live in the capital of Gayana, Josh town. But 90% of the population of this country lives in the narrow coastal stream. On the northern side of this country. Which is the 10% area of this country. The remaining 90% of the country is almost empty. At present time, you can see roads in Josh town. The roads are very modern. The roads are of very good quality here. Sometimes there is a road of 3 to 4 lanes. The people who came here 8 to 10 years ago told me. The roads here were very less developed. It used to be very less. Roads were not built in most places. Not much, it was 8 to 10 years ago. So now we have reached one of the most popular streets of Josh town. Which is called Regent Street. It is said that there are many Indian shops on this street. You are getting a lot of local snacks here. There are chips and some fruits. These are the local snacks of Guyana. Before this, I was in Suriname. Almost everyone there was camera friendly. Nobody had a problem with the camera. But here, not many people want to come on the camera. Look at the name of the shop here. Aar Singh and Sons. I met some Indogainese people here. But they don't want to come on the camera. So I am not able to show them. But everyone is giving me a warning. Be very careful. And take care of yourself. Almost everyone in this country doesn't know Hindi. I told you in the last video. But in Guyana, 15, 20, 30 or even 50 years ago. Many Sindhis came here from Gujarat to do business. There are many Sindhis shops on this street. You will get to know by looking at the name of the shop. They also speak Hindi. Raminas Anand. There is a big OMB written on the shop. It is written Shamdas Kirplani. It is probably an Indian shop. They came here to do business many years ago. They came here when this country was in a very bad condition. Let's go inside the Om Shamdas Kirplani shop. Let's see what kind of a shop it is. The shop looks very big and nice. Hello. How are you? I am shooting with permission.

They've printed the whole forest on the book side. Very beautiful. He's not reacting. It's okay. I was showing you the colorful designs of the local vans here. 4-5 Afro-Guyanese came and surrounded me. They asked me why I was using the camera. They were very aggressive and angry. They asked me why I was using the camera. They asked me why I was recording. They asked me what's the purpose. They asked me what's the work. They asked me where I came from. They were shouting at me very negatively and angrily. I tried to calm them down. I tried to convince them. Finally, they said okay. That's what happened. For a few seconds, I felt like they'll either take my camera or break it. I don't know. I think I'm out. It's 7.30 PM now. I'm with Manoj. Where are you from in India? I'm from Pune, Maharashtra. How long have you been here? In Guyana? It's been a year. You're working here? Yes, I'm a civil engineer. We've come to a very popular location here. It's called Sea Wall. Actually, Guyana city is located 6-7 feet below sea level. So, they've built a sea wall here. What happens if they don't build a sea wall? In high tide, the whole of Georgetown will be submerged. It will be submerged. The Dutch started the sea wall. The British also continued it. People told me that if you dig a little bit of the ground, water will come out. Water comes out at 2-4 feet. People think that this is a poor country. It's not a poor country. People play in the millions here. Everyone has money. Yes, everyone has money. People are poor, but they have money. Yes, everyone has money. The Indian community is a little more wealthy. There is a lot of influence of the US and China in this country. All the oil exploration and oil production that is happening here, the US company is doing all the work. The US controls the whole of Guyana, according to me. I have a little contact. Our work comes under the ministry. If you look at the Chinese supermarket, it's all Chinese-dominant. Chinese restaurants are open in every corner of the country. In every village? Yes, in every village. They don't have import duty. They have a treaty with China. Not with India? No, not with India. So, they bring a lot of containers and sell them at a lower price than the supermarkets in Guyana. So, obviously, people will go to them. In the past 5 years, the Chinese have demolished the entire business of Guyana. I was looking at the import of Guyana. This container mostly imports from the US and China. And India is nowhere. Nothing. Only spices. Five spices. We have come to an Indian restaurant to eat. This is Paneer Butter Masala. And this is Dal Makhani. Something like that. It looks very tasty. And this is Garlic Naan. And Jeera Rice will also be served. We will eat this later. We have come to a pastry shop. Someone was telling me that this pastry shop is very popular here. There are bakery items. There are a lot of cakes here. There is an ice cream lounge here. There are a lot of ice cream varieties here. Look, cricket is playing on TV. Cricket is played everywhere here. Guyana is a part of West Indies. There were a lot of popular cricket players of Guyana. They have played in the team of West Indies. Shiv Narayan, Chandrapal, Ram Naresh Sarwan. There are many more. These are all from Guyana. So, guys, we have taken this ice cream. Creamy Caramel Flavor. Something like that. It looks very yummy. The president of Guyana is Mr. Irfan Ali. He is an Indokainese. He is the first Muslim to become the president of Guyana. He has studied in Delhi. He has come to Delhi to study. And what is the name of the vice president? Bharat Jagdeo. He is a Hindu. He is also an Indokainese. And Bharat Jagdeo is the vice president at present. But before that, both the prime minister and the president have been. There is a rule here. No president can stay more than twice. Yes, he follows the US. That's why he became the vice president. This is how it is said. His family came from Amethi district of Uttar Pradesh. As an indentured labor. So, guys, the next day has passed. I have come to an Iskcon Temple. I am with Vikram. Hello, guys. He has helped me a lot in Guyana. He took me to many places. When we came here, there was a prayer being held upstairs. Yes, there was a prayer being held. I see you from here. You already know me? Yeah, I know you. I follow your programs. Suriname, Brazil, Malabar, Iran. Pleasure to meet you, sir. You are from Guyana? Yeah, I am from Guyana. There are a lot of people. They are taking prasad. You can see. There are a lot of people sitting here. You can see. So, guys, I have come to the outskirts of Guyana's capital, Josh Town. There is a temple and an ashram here. You can see this here. There is a very big statue of Lord Shankar here. There is a temple and an ashram inside it. And there is a gurukul located inside the ashram. Namaste. Namaste, ma'am. How are you? I am fine. How are you? I am fine too. Where are you from in India? We are from Delhi. Hello. Hello. Hello. What is your name? Himani. Himani. What is your name? Vanya. Which class are you in? 5th. And you? 5th. So, everything in this temple and ashram is in English. The worship and studies here are all in English. In this regard, I liked Suriname very much. Almost everyone knows Hindi there. This is the second temple in this complex. This is the temple of Lord Shankar. I was in this ashram when I saw this bus. It says Hindu College on the bus. Like Indian IPL, there is a cricket league in Caribbean and West Indies. It is called CPL, Caribbean Premier League. There are six different teams in it. Caribbean and West Indies countries. And there is a team from Guyana in CPL. Suddenly, I found a very long parade of the Caribbean cricket league. In this parade, there are individual parades of the entire CPL cricket team. It is a very long parade. I think it is at least 1 km long. All the participating people from the Caribbean countries have come to celebrate this parade. In their cultural attire. Many people are dancing, singing, partying, enjoying the parade on the road. They are taking different types of drinks.
