- [Joanna] So you just traded (tape zipping) It's now part of the $64.5 In 2022, 73.5 million used and refurbished phones were It's an exploding business, and the cellular carriers - Trade in. - Trade in. that suits your life now. - But who's winning and When I asked the carriers and Apple to show me where the phones go and if and how they make money on them, they wouldn't speak about specifics. That's why I came here to a warehouse in the middle of New Jersey. Every week, this facility receives tens of thousands of devices, primarily Apple from cellular carriers. - So this is three and it should be around 3,000 iPhones. - The company then sells those phones. Some go to wholesalers in other countries, others get cleaned up, put through the refurbished to individual buyers on sites a popular refurbished phone marketplace. We got an iPhone 11. - This one's a great example 'cause it's still kind of dirty. - [Joanna] Yep, I picked out to track the cycle and how it goes from arriving here with a trade-in value of $200 to leaving here To understand, we have to go The first stop for our iPhone - We take the phones, we start to these computers that are to remove any potential from the devices. - [Joanna] After that, the Well, many tests. You can't sell a phone that doesn't work. - [Sammy] Nice and white, no shadows. Now checking the reds. We're good status there, right? So you take a screenshot, now hit the slide switch up and down. Say cheese. - [Joanna] That obviously - [Sammy] That's 'cause of you. We're not gonna blame the phone for that. Say cheese. (phone beeping) - [Sammy] So that was it checking speaker. On the front over here, You see the light on my hands? So you can say yes, it's on. - [Joanna] I'm really not good at this. - [Sammy] It's okay. It's day one. You're doing pretty good. The devices now do a test call. - [Joanna] Success. Our iPhone The next step, cleaning. - Toothbrush, plastic peg, microfiber cloth, foam (tranquil music) - Looks nice and clean. After that, it's onto over the device and assigns it a grade so they know how to price it. - [Sammy] Gonna look at the the back glass, if there's any scratches. - [Joanna] Success again, And the final stop, kitting. - We're gonna take this so that we can get this - [Joanna] US Mobile called Back in the Box, which is responsible for selling to consumers on sites like Before the phone is shipped, with a charging cable - Drop it. Drop it. - I mean... - Our poor phone. (Sammy chuckling) (phone dropping) Okay, so now it's ready. But how much is someone Well, for some context, Apple doesn't make the iPhone 11 anymore but you can still buy a for around $500 at some retailers. Back in the Box obviously - Typically what we like to do is we like to price refurbished products between 20 to 30% below its that gives a good and gives us enough margin to be able to have some money, and buy more inventory - [Joanna] On its website, for a used, good condition Back in the Box told me from a carrier for around $250. Then after the phone was refurbished, it listed it for $350 on Back Market, which takes a 10% cut of that sale. Back in the Box takes home around $65, but that's not all profit. - Put a ton of labor into There's also a charger in that There's also a ton of either had a bad battery or at some other defect that So we have to make enough profit on the good ones to be on the bad ones. - So what did we learn here today? Well, that there are more winners than losers in this business. The cellular carriers win and buy a new one. Refurbished companies a refurbished phone and consumers and the environment win along the way. - The downside is maybe to the stock price of the manufacturers that wanna sell as many brand new retail products. - [Joanna] Perhaps, but even for Apple, if all these phones end up in the hands of more people, particularly in developing countries, it and more people buying into (Sammy singing in foreign language) (Sammy chuckling) - That's all I got for you. - [Joanna] That's very good.
