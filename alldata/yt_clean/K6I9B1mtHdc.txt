A NORMALIZATION AGREEMENT SOON. OUTSIDE THE MIDDLE EAST, HOW TRUMP WILL GET ON THE PHONE I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK THE PRESIDENT RAN IN THESE CONFLICTS AROUND THE HIS BASE DOES NOT LIKE -- THE SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE. HIMSELF AS A MASTER DEALMAKER THIS NEGOTIATION QUICKLY. EUROPEANS VERY NERVOUS. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES IS UKRAINE AND YOU CAN TELL THIS BECAUSE THE BIDEN LOCK IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OF AND INAUGURATION DAY. LISA: DEAL LOOKS LIKE BETWEEN RUSSIA LIKE TO ORCHESTRATE?

THROUGH ON THE AUSTIN GO THAT POINTS TO GET TO NEUTRAL, THEN RATE HIKES IN 2025. JONATHAN: ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF A A WORLD IN WHICH STOCKS THERE IS ONLY ONE THING WHICH WHICH IS THE POSSIBILITY OF CREATING INFLATION. DID THE FED CUT RATES TO ZERO? BECOMING MASSIVELY STIMULATIVE. INFLATION. WANT TO GET INFLATION IS THE YIELDS WILL GO UP SO MUCH THAT THAT IS WHAT I THINK WILL BE RIGHT NOW WITH ALL OF THE BOTH FISCAL AND MONETARY STOP THIS MARKET UNLESS WE GET RATES. LISA: MARKETS SEEM TO BE THE PROSPECT CUTTING BY 25 BASIS POINTS INFLATION SUFFICIENT TO IGNITE THE YIELD CURVE. GETTING IT WRONG? JIM: IT WRONG. FED WEEK. WHEN THE MOVE INDEX IT A 13 THE WEEK. WITH ALL THE VOLATILITY IS A 15 BASIS POINT IN THE 10 WE ARE OVER READING A LOT OF GETTING THIS WEEK WITH WHETHER CHANGING. AT THE BIGGER PICTURE, THE WITH THE FED CUT IN INTACT. ANNMARIE: UNDERSTAND THE AMOUNT OF SYSTEM CURRENTLY AS WE HEARD WHAT COULD GET IGNITED WITH THE STIMULATIVE MEASURES? JIM: AS FAR AS INFLATION, LET'S BASKET IS IN SERVICES. POLICY. IT HAS BEEN A FAIRLY GOOD TRYING TO MEASURE IS WAGE IF WE CONTINUE TO SEE THAT KIND YOU WILL START TO SEE INFLATION YOU THROW IN THE POTENTIAL OF FORM OF INFLATION. YOU COULD SEE THE INFLATION WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A THAT IF IT DOES START GOING UP, IDEA WE ARE NOT IN A 2% WORLD, THAT SHOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE FOR SHOULD NOT BE CUTTING IN THAT DO YOU THINK THE IMMEDIATE FROM TARIFFS OR TAX CUTS? JIM: CUTS. CORPORATE TAX RATE AND IT WILL TARIFFS IS DIFFICULT. 50% OF THE PEOPLE I TALKED TO THE OTHER 50% THINK IT IS A THREATENING TARIFFS. AN OPEN QUESTION. GAMBIT SIDE THAT HE IS DEAL AND WILL NOT SEE AS MANY. YOU THINK THE MARKET IS OVER NOT KNOW WHAT THE MARGIN WILL REPRESENTATIVES? JIM: THERE IS AN ASSUMPTION THAT THE FISCAL STIMULUS FROM THE TRUMP MANY ROADBLOCKS. TO TAX POLICY COULD BE WHETHER WAVE THAT EXTENDS TO THE HOUSE MORE THAN ONE SEAT. LEGISLATION INTO ORDER. SKIS RIGHT NOW BUT IT IS HARD WE HAVE BEEN PLAYING A GAME CROSS ASSET STRATEGIST. HOW BEFORE EQUITY INVESTORS CARE? SAY THAT IS A SILLY QUESTION CIRCUMSTANCE. WOULD MAKE THIS EQUITY MARKET MORE CLOSELY? WOULD TAKE AT A TIME IT SEEMS UNFAZED BY EVERYTHING? JIM: ANSWER BECAUSE IT IS 4.25 AND WAIT A MINUTE, THE STOCK MARKET THAT COMES BACK TO WHAT YOU ARE THE EMOTIONAL REACTION OF THE POTENTIAL FISCAL STIMULUS. YIELDS WERE 5.25. WE WILL START TO SEE THAT THESE THEY CONTINUE TO MOVE HIGHER STOCK MARKET. WHAT WAS THE STOCK MARKET DOING MONDAY. YIELDS WERE ABOVE 4.25. JUST SIDETRACKED WITH THE STIMULUS. YIELD STAY AT THAT LEVEL OR GO LISA: ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE EQUITY MARKET. MORE LEVERAGED TO YIELDS THAT THEY TEND TO DO WORSE. BE AHEAD FAKE? JIM: I THINK OVER TIME IT WILL. CAPS IS THAT IS ANOTHER WAY OF EVERYONE HAS BEEN RUNNING COUPLE OF DAYS WITH THE IDEA EARNINGS, IT WILL MEAN PEOPLE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. RUSHING TOWARDS THOSE KINDS OF ONCE WE GET PAST THE EUPHORIA, WE SAW IN CHINA LAST MONTH WHEN STIMULUS AND THEIR STOCK MARKET IT. IT IS BB AND MEANDERING WE ARE IN THE ROCKETING PART IT MIGHT NOT BE DONE WITH BUT WITH WE PRICED IT IN AND NOW WE ANY OF THE STIMULUS IN THE MEANTIME OF INTEREST LEVELS ARE GOING HIGHER, IT ALWAYS THOUGHT-PROVOKING. BIANCO. PUBLISHED RATE CUTS ARE STILL ARE UNDERESTIMATING THE THE FED REACTION FUNCTION. WITH DANI BURGER. DANI: HAS PICKED HIS CHIEF OF STAFF.

LISA: MENTIONED THINGS ARE GETTING FRONTLOADING ORDERS TO GET MIGHT, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL CAN YOU GIVE US SOME SCOPE OF RATES ARE ABLE TO GO UP FOR U.S. CERTAINTY? RYAN: LITTLE BIT HIGHER. ANYONE THING. I WOULD NOT WANT TO SAY THE BECAUSE OF TARIFFS OR BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC NUMBER WE HAVE SET IT EVERY TIME. YOU SEE A BIG SURGE. ADMINISTRATION WITH A INCREASE CHINESE STEEL. RATES WENT UP ABOUT THREE TIMES HISTORICAL AVERAGE IT COSTS FROM THE ASIA TO THE U.S.. THAT WENT UP TO OVER $6,000 THIS SUMMER AND IT WAS DRIVEN BEFORE THE PORT STRIKE AND WE HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE SOMETHING SIMILAR. LISA: IDEA WE HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF THE 2018 THERE IS A REAL QUESTION OF HOW REJIGGERED THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS FOCUS ON NEAR SHORING AND ON HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SEEN A SHIFT IN TERMS OF WHERE THEY SHIP IT HAS BEEN MASSIVE OVER THE DRIVEN BY THE TARIFFS. CHINESE LABOR COSTS HAVE GONE GOOD FOR THE WORKERS IN CHINA. SOURCE OF LABOR FOR THE WORLD RELOCATING. MEXICO. MANY OTHER COUNTRIES DO. CHAINS WHERE YOU CANNOT GET IT THE MANUFACTURING EXPERTISE, SUPPLIERS , AND FOR THAT I AM THE ELECTRONIC SECTOR HAS A OUT OF CHINA. E-COMMERCE. GOING DIRECT TO CONSUMER ALL 50% OF THE WORLDS AIRFREIGHT. TO SHUT THAT DOWN OR IMPOSE THOSE FLY DUTY-FREE UNDER THE EVEN THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION BORDER PROTECTION'S TO TAKE THAT MAY MAKE THOSE THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THESE NEW TARIFFS ARE ON TOP OF ADMINISTRATION PUT IN, IT IS TRUMP'S TARIFFS. THEY WILL BE TALKING ABOUT YOU MENTIONED VIETNAM AND I WONDER, ESPECIALLY GIVEN SOME FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, HOW THAT MEXICO IS A TROJAN HORSE THE SAME WITH VIETNAM. RYAN: EXPORTS FROM CHINA TO THESE THAT IMPLIES WE ARE EITHER MATERIALS INTO A MANUFACTURING IS PROBABLY FRAUD WHERE THEY'RE SAYING MADE IN MEXICO IS I THINK IT IS PROBABLY MORE RAW THE MARKET FINDS A WAY. GOOD AT MANUFACTURING, VERY USING THAT. ADVANTAGE AND THE MARKETS RALLY THE OTHER FACTOR IS IT IS TRUCKING IS EXPENSIVE. OF CARGO FROM MEXICO TO THE THAN SHIPPING A CONTAINER FROM OCEAN FREIGHT, THE PHYSICS ARE IT IS SO MUCH CHEAPER THAN LAND IT IS NOT JUST BECAUSE MEXICO ANNMARIE: WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT GIVEN ADMINISTRATION. WILL SEE MORE FREIGHT GO WE HAVE STARTED SEE A LITTLE THROUGH THE RED SEA IN THE LAST -- ANYONE HAD AN IDEA TRUMP SOME CARRIERS ARE STARTING TO THERE IS A REAL POSSIBILITY FOR ANY INSIGHT INTO WHAT TRUMP REBELS THERE. INITIATIVES AND POLICIES AND VERY UNCLEAR. DID NOT GET ENOUGH ATTENTION REBELS IN YEMEN, OR THE TAKING BRIBES AND RUNNING A BILLION A YEAR FROM OCEAN MOVE CARGO THROUGH, A PAYOFF TO THAT IS A CRAZY DEPLOYMENT IF MORE ABOUT IT. OTHER THAN READING IT IN THE JONATHAN: TABLE THAT WILL CHASE THAT THIS WAS SUPER SHARP. ABOUT MEXICO. MEXICO CAME OUT LAST MONTH FROM ASIA COME FROM 54 AND A LARGE CHUNK OF THOSE LARGE CHUNK OF THOSE AMERICAN AUTOMAKERS. AND THE PRESIDENT-ELECT WANTS IT IS UNCLEAR WHERE THINGS ARE CHINA OR GOODS FROM THE U.S. OTHER COUNTRIES TO NOT ORIGIN. JONATHAN: STILL HAPPENING IN THE RED SEA. IT IS HAPPENING AND IT IS FOR A LOT OF THE COMPANIES. UP NEXT, LOOK AHEAD TO NEXT JONATHAN: TOTALLY UNCHANGED ON THE S&amp;P YOU CAN TAKE A BREATHER THIS ON THE NASDAQ WE ARE DOWN BY COMING INTO FRIDAY AT RECORD OPENING BALLOT, HERE IS MANUS &gt;&gt; 2 BILLION PEOPLE HAVE LIFETIME OF THIS COMPANY'S BOOKINGS WERE UP 8%, SO THE HOW ARE YOUR MARGINS?

DO THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY AND THE TYPE OF STIMULUS PEOPLE ARE THAT IS REALLY THE KEY INCREASINGLY NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE THE WILLOW CAPABILITY. IT HAS BEEN ONE ON REPEAT. THEY ARE WAITING TO SEE WHAT WE ARE STILL WAITING. POLICY AND WHAT IT LOOK LIKE. WE EXPECT FOMC TO CUT RATES IN UPWARD REVISIONS TO OUR CHANGING OUR RATE CALL FOR 2025. RATES ONLY TWICE BY 25 BASIS GOOD MORNING. PROJECTION. INFLATION PROJECTIONS. ON WHAT? WHAT WE LEARNED THIS WEEK WAS ELECTION IS THAT WE WILL LIKELY NEXT YEAR AND WE WILL LIKELY IMMIGRATION. OUTCOME IN THE HOUSE OF WE THINK THAT WITH THE TARIFFS INCREASE IN PRICES, IN THE INFLATION, WE THINK ALREADY IN WE ESTIMATE THAT THE TARIFFS GOOD HALF A PERCENT POINT IN POINT TO. 2026. IMMIGRATION ARE GOING TO MARKET. ARE LIKELY GOING TO SEE A BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR. RAISING OUR INFLATION FORECAST LITTLE MORE IN 2025. JONATHAN: -- MARC: WE THINK THERE IS LIKELY GOING THE U.S. COUNTRIES. EFFECT. OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE IN ANY CASE THIS IS WHAT WE ASSUMPTION. CONTRIBUTE TO ROUGHLY HALF OF UNDER THE FULL 10%, 60% ON WITH THIS WE EXPECT THAT WILL THE PRICE LEVEL, WHICH WOULD .2 PERCENT IN 2026. PART WE THINK THAT IMPOSE TIGHTER RESTRICTION THAN HAS ALREADY IMPOSED WITH THE JUNE. THE ASSUMPTIONS WE MAKE HERE IS THE IMMIGRATION FLOWS WE HAD IS THE BIG CHARGE FROM TARIFFS EITHER ON THE PRODUCER OR OR IS IT THAT IT HAS TO BE MADE SOMEWHERE ELSE HAS TO BE THE YOU HAVE A TIGHT LABOR MARKET, AND MAYBE NOT EVEN THE PRODUCTION? MARC: IT IS ALL OF THE ABOVE. INCREASING THE PRICE OF IMPORTS. OF AN UPSET FROM THE DOLLAR POTENTIALLY THAT COULD THEN, TO YOUR POINT, YOU NEED DOMESTICALLY. PRODUCE THESE GOODS THAT WILL RAISE THE PRICE ON DOMESTICALLY AS WELL. GOING BACK AND FORTH BUT THE IMPORT PRICES AND THEN MAYBE RAISE ALL OF THEM. ANNMARIE: AMERICA THE FUTURE PRESIDENT IS RATE. OFFSETTING THE INCREASE YOU PROPOSALS, THEY BE DECREASING I THINK LONGER TERM SHORT RUN YOU NEED TO PRODUCE CONSTRUCT THE PLANTS AND ALL OF PRODUCTION CAPACITY. ALL OF THAT OUTPUT THAT IS NOW U.S. TIME YOU LIMIT IMMIGRATION WORKERS ARE COMING FROM. RATE AT THIS POINT I WOULD SAY LABOR MARKET. WITH AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE CLOSE MARKET AND A POPULATION THAT IS BASICALLY NOT REALLY RETURNING CLEAR AT ALL WHO IS GOING TO BE JONATHAN: FORECAST. THEY WERE ASKED ABOUT NEW FORECASTS IN DECEMBER. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE WHEN? MARC: OF THESE QUESTIONS AND SAID, WE HERE AND SO IT SOUNDS LIKE SO TRUMP POLICIES PUT IN PLACE THIS NEWS WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN SEPTEMBER. THE GDP, NATIONAL INCOME. WE HAVE SEEN EXPECTED INFLATION ALL OF THAT WOULD SUGGEST THE END UP LOWER THAN THE FED HAD THAT ACTIVITY IS GOING TO BE THAT INFLATION IS GOING TO BE THIS IS ABSENT ANY OF THE NEW NEXT YEAR. YEAR WE CAN ANTICIPATE, AS I INFLATION AND MORE ACTIVITY, MARKET. RATE PATH OVERALL IS GOING TO HIGHER THAN WHAT THE FED HAD I WONDER, ESPECIALLY SINCE JAY INFLATION AS A NEW CONCERN THEY EMPLOYMENT, I'M WONDERING HOW CPI REPORT TO POTENTIALLY DECEMBER RATE CUT? MARC: MEETING YESTERDAY WITH HAVE BASICALLY LEFT ALL OF THE MEETING. GO WITH A 25 BASIS POINT CUT YESTERDAY THAT THEY SEE POLICY THEY THINK THEY WANT TO GO TO A RATE, AND SO, WE THINK THEY THINK IT IS GOING TO BE A CLOSE INFLATION PRINT NEXT WEEK COMES EXPECT SOMETHING AROUND .3% FOR WEEK. WHAT THEY HAD ANTICIPATED AT AND THEN WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER MEETING. IMPORTANT PAYROLL REPORT IN THAT ONE IS GOING TO BE IT IS GOING TO TELL US PACE OF JOB GAINS. PRINT WAS PARTICULARLY NOISY OF THAT. THE PAYROLL PRINT. JONATHAN: MARC: JOB GAINS IS $150,000 A MONTH, OCTOBER. PRINT OF 300 IN EARLY DECEMBER. THEY ARE ON, 150. WHEN YOU SIT DOWN AT THE FOMC DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE THAT THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A RATE IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU. MARC GIANNONI OF BARCLAYS. LOOKING AHEAD, THEY ARE LOOKING THE S&amp;P 500 JUST A LITTLE BIT THE OPENING BELL IS ABOUT 49 WE ARE LOOKING AT EQUITY TO BEAR IN MIND WE CAME INTO S&amp;P 500, RECORD HIGHS ON THE AT A WEEKLY GAIN THAT IS THE WE HAD THE BEST POST-ELECTION HISTORY OF MARKETS AND THE BEST IS THAT RIGHT?

SUBADRA RAJAPPA, IT IS GOOD TO BARCLAYS JUST SAID 25 BASIS AND THAT IS IT. SUBADRA: PRICING IN, A DECEMBER RATE CUT WE STILL THINK THAT PERHAPS AS AND WILL DELIVER THAT THERE IS AROUND THOSE -- AROUND THAT LESSER CUTS THAN WHAT THE IS SHOWING. JONATHAN: BARCLAYS IS MAKING SOME ABOUT IMMIGRATION, ABOUT TRADE. BOND CALL, IS IT TOO EARLY OR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT POLICY AT THIS POINT WE HAVE MORE AT THIS POINT WE HAVE MORE I HAVE TRIED TO GO THROUGH THAT FORECASTS FOR TREASURIES, AND THAT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TO BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 4% AND AND THEN GOING INTO NEXT YEAR SEEING A LOT MORE VOLATILITY ON WHETHER TARIFFS GET PASSED, STIMULUS FROM TAX CUTS AND WHAT EXTENT THE POLICIES THEY CAMPAIGN. JONATHAN: STILL YET TO DISCOVER WHETHER ONCE WE WORK OUT WHETHER THEY WORK OUT HOW WORKABLE THE WHETHER THERE IS ANY RESISTANCE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. THAT MEANS FOR THE BOND MARKET. ALL WEEK YOU CAN VIEW IT AS A EVENT THAT REDEFINES THE MACRO IF YOU ASK PEOPLE AT THE MOMENT MIX OF ONE AND TWO OR ONE OR WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE HIS PEOPLE CLEARING EVENT AND THAT I HAVE GOTTEN FROM ALL OF THE IN BONDS IT IS MORE OF A WE SHOULD NOT BE ACCUSTOMED TO TREASURY YIELDS AS BEING THE DO YOU VIEW IT? IT REDEFINE THE MACRO OUTLOOK? I THINK IT IS TOO SOON TO SAY. THE BOND MARKET THIS WEEK IS EVENT, WE SAW VOLATILITY COME THE INITIAL KNEE-JERK REACTION OF THE YIELD CURVE, WHICH IS WAS ANTICIPATING. POSITIONING WAS RELATIVELY ELECTIONS AND THE FACT THAT THE IN FOR A TRUMP SCENARIO I THINK WAS FOR THE MARKET TO TAKE A JONATHAN: WHICH DID NOT HELP. IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. LISA: WHICH IS, WE HAD BEEN PRESSING OUT, THEN BACK IN. YOU THINK WE ARE IN A RANGE GETTING OVER THEIR SKIS TALKING TREASURY YIELDS AND ALL OF POTENTIAL MOVES. A TIME WHEN SOME PEOPLE ARE WAKING UP TO THE FACT THAT THIS BAKED IN? SUBADRA: GOING INTO YEAR-END I THINK IT I THINK INVESTORS ARE GOING TO YOU TYPICALLY SEE THAT, BUT GOING TO START SEEING THE TARIFFS. ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT -- T ICKING UP. MUCH A CONCERN. YOU COULD GET FROM THE TRUMP CONCERN THAT INFLATION IS GOING TO BE HIGH AND PERSISTENT NEXT IN THAT ENVIRONMENT IT IS GOING TO CUT RATES CAMINO, EVEN IF EMPLOYMENT IS STARTING IT IS GOING TO BE THAT IMPACT IS GOING TO BE ON AROUND EMPLOYMENT AND GROWTH. THE FED MAY HAVE TO BE ON GOING TO SEE THE ECB MOVE? THE METAL? SUBADRA: SITUATION. AT THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS MEANINGFULLY THEN PERHAPS EVEN AND SO, THEY ARE GOING TO NEED OF THE IMPACT OF POLICIES FROM THEN YOU ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT AND OTHER GEOPOLITICAL RISKS POLITICS CHANGING MEANINGFULLY THEY HAVE A VERY TOUGH BIAS IS THAT THE ECB CUTS MORE ARE THEY THE BIGGEST LOSER IN YOU MEAN EUROPE? POTENTIALLY. WHAT THE SPECIFICS ARE AND HOW CAN ACTUALLY PASS AND WHAT MEDIUM TERM. JONATHAN: HOW DO YOU WRITE AN OUTLOOK FOR TYPICALLY AROUND NOW THEY ARE WE WAITED FOR THE U.S. TOGETHER? WHAT DO YOU DO? SUBADRA: MOST CHALLENGING YEARS TO COME FOR HOW THINGS ARE GOING TO PAN ONE HAND YOU HAVE THE DYNAMICS THE FRONT END PEGGED OR THERE WOULD NOT EVEN CUT RATES OR THERE IS THAT DYNAMIC, THEN ON OF SUSS OUT WHAT THE IMPACT IS IS IT GOING TO SLOW DOWN GROWTH INFLATIONARY AND YOU START TO INFLATION EXPECTATIONS ACROSS THIS IS A VERY CONFUSING WITH A FORECAST. SO, WE WILL BE WEEKS TRYING TO SUSS OUT THE I'M IN THE CHEAP SEATS. NOW. LISA: BUY DARK PARTS AND HOW AND BLINDFOLDS SO WE CAN MAKE SHAPE FOR SURVEILLANCE COME APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
