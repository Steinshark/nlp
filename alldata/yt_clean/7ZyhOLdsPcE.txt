Rank? - Major. - Search him. Look for documents. And conduct an interrogation. No documents. He says his rank is major. Do you copy? He said that 120 of them arrived in today. There were about 160 in total. 50-60 of them fled. They all ran away in the morning. All? Once we started to storm them, right? What about the rest? Those who were running across? Were they taken down? It's fucking crazy how many were killed here. Fuck. They're moving towards us. I see. I see. Wait. Wait. Wait. - Take aim well. Fucking dropped them. Bitch. They're moving. Bro, right next to the road. The WIA faggot's lying down. I don't see him to finish him. Try to take him out so we can run out. Enough. Enough. Enough. That's it? He's done? It's all clear here. Lads, there might be just some shit lying on the ground with burrows under it. So, it seems like we've stormed it, right. We had to record it all to show that we did our job. So that people can see that Andriivka is ours. We need to be replaced. So that we can rest a little. Because we're fucking done with this Andriivka. This forest... This treeline... This fucking pipe... ?an you look out and see if there is any high-rise building that is more or less quiet. To raise the flag there. &quot;Student&quot;. &quot;Student&quot; It's &quot;Fedya&quot;. Reading you. Alright. It's September 16th now. Third Assault Brigade has completely taken the village of Andriivka. Glory to the Nation! Death to the enemies! In memory of all fallen brothers. We'll avenge you!
