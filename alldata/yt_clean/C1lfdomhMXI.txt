- Are you ready to dream? We're onboard of brand new (upbeat rock music) Welcome aboard this brand new CdM Flexplorer We're really excited to I mean, CdM did it again, as they always do. But this is very special, very different. The interior is different. There's a purpose behind this boat. There is just so much to show you. So, let's do it. - [Rico] Well, how about this massive, A-frame crane system here. - It's a four ton A-frame crane. If you guys haven't that we have on our channel, I'll put the link in the out in the popup right here, for you to check it out. But this a whole different level. They just stepped it up. We could do the technical part. - Okay, so let's finish up with the crane, because we have so much more to show you. First of all, the crane has three hoist points, so instead of one just in the center, there's actually three points for the tender to be lifted. So, the crane is not this just a demonstrate that is has a big A-frame. So, we have these go all the way in here, all this folds up, as you guys can see, it's a loose panel. It folds up all the way around, the whole floor folds up all the way around to this spot here, and then connects over And the whole A-frame crane folds into the floor when it's not being used. That is pretty incredible. - [Victoria] Gone. You will never know it's here. - Correct. Another unique feature of this vessel is they do have these which expands our beach club The extensions come in, it's very safe, but as you can tell, this whole area here will come up, the A-frame's in, this is up, and it just looks like and you will never know that - [Rico] Well, another which is unique as well, that there is no mooring equipment here. No bollards here, no capstans here. The folding bulwarks go all the way aft, we have a subwoofer sitting here, did I say that already? There's a subwoofer, there are lots of subwoofers here. Anyways, so there is a and we have the mooring equipment actually down on the swim platform, which is almost the We get to that later though. - He's so excited. Just tell 'em how much sound - I learned yesterday that - [Victoria] What? - [Victoria] What? - [Victoria] What? - [Victoria] What? Yes. In sounds here. So. - [Victoria] All right, let's go. - Good morning, Captain. - [Victoria] Good morning, Captain. - So anyways, we have another super cool it's right where Victoria's standing. (upbeat music) - And you would never know it's here. It's just gone, hidden, completely safe. - [Rico] So, cool thing is, it actually has a tank below deck where the water can drain in. It stays heated, it stays fresh, and you don't waste a lot of water once you get to your destination. You just pump it back into the pool, and ready to go. - Fantastic, thank you, Captain. So, all this furniture But there is a moment and they do have a custom tender. An aluminum tender. - An aluminum tender, which I believe sits here There's still space for a And an additional tender So, this whole deck can Obviously, with a big crane, You could even put an ATV And just drop it off when you're in the harbor, and use it to cruise around. - [Victoria] Or a little car. - Or a little car. - How big of a car can you put four ton? What do you think? - Really? - [Rico] It's a four ton crane. - So, four ton, I don't know how tall, how heavy the cars are. - [Rico] Well, I mean, our Hummer would not be That's too heavy. - Oh, that's a deal-breaker. - [Rico] Any regular car, you - Insane, right? - [Rico] Yes. - Okay, let's keep going, And as we're going through, pay attention to the speakers. So, a speaker there, a speaker there, there's four speakers just in this space. Because the family who owns and there was a huge party here last night for the boat show. - [Rico] Okay, moving on. - As we're walking forward, first of all, unique way to store Seabobs. Very cool, still on display, but it is nicely tucked away as well. And mostly in the shade. The concept of Flexplorer is so unique, because it literally allows you to have this insane entertainment deck, which is basically closest to the water, which personally, I because you can swim and Which is when you have you're ending up being depending on what you want to do. So here, it's all together, personally, I prefer that. So, here, we do have a large dining, a fresco dining area. - [Rico] We have overhead for the colder areas, cruising areas. - And we'll tell you why in a moment, because this yacht has a goal, So right here, we have a this is a custom piece, custom bar that was made for this yacht. There's a few of these pieces that you guys will see onboard by a famous designer. There is a sink here and everything here is drawers. There are drink fridges built-in, so everything you need to Obviously, this bar has to be service this very very large deck. All right, so just quickly pop in here, we do have our side decks, with side door coming into the galley, so it's great for provisioning. Here, they have a weather door, which is also fantastic, when we're hanging out in that area or any bad foul weather. And this is a. - [Rico] Secondary entrance - Got it, staircase. - [Rico] So, when you're on the wing, instead of going through the transom, of course it will be closed up, this would be a way in to the - Fantastic. All right, let's go show you the salon. Come on in to our salon. Personally, I am in love with this space. - [Rico] Well, first of all, it feels like you're still outside. - Yes. - [Rico] Look at the which completely tucks away, completely gets out of the way. No glass left. Zero threshold. - These doors. - [Rico] And almost all I mean, very small frame, so you really feel the - Yes, and personally, I feel like we are on a massive megacat, the way the space is laid out. - [Rico] The beam. - It's all open. The beam. The best feature I feel It's just panoramic. Massive window. And the way worked out this space, it's completely convertible. So this furniture could So, if you're cruising, if you are underway, if you guys have watched that we got to do all by ourselves in a 443 meter yacht with 60 people crew, this is what we did. You just hang out, you watch the scenery go by, and this is living. This is really true cruising when you can just be in a I'm surprised you're able to when I am standing right in the middle of these two speakers. - [Rico] Yeah, we got some There's a pop down TV, pop up, pop down. Dropdown. - Dropdown. - [Rico] There is a dropdown TV right over Victoria over there. So, this will be the great And how do they achieve these windows going all the way down to almost the floor in asymmetrical layout? - Exactly. - So, we do have the full and have the side walk - Well, let's go to the port side quick. So, right here, we have You can tell, they like to entertain, because you don't get a fridge like this unless you like to entertain. And this space is another custom piece that we talked about, so there's a custom bar here. Look at the sink. Very very cool. Of course, it's all setup, There's a couple of bar stools as well. Beautiful artwork. There's some stunning artwork - [Rico] Is that a bottle storage? - Yeah, I think so. Yeah. It's like a proper bottle storage. So, you can make cocktails underway no matter what the weather is. You've got a bottle you can put it in. Okay, then, right here, we have our indoor dining, so our formal dining. But as you can tell, there's nothing really The interior design is so fun. It's got its own personality. There's nothing stuffy or - [Rico] Let's check out the galley. - The galley? Okay, let's pop in real quick. So, the galley is so unique the way that they've designed it, because the owners like it is completely so crew is part of the family, that's how they run this yacht. There's a fire tight door right here that of course separates according to class. But when it's open, you can still fully function together. And the way they're able a full commercial setup here, with this industrial look, is definitely unique. - [Rico] Yeah, it looks. - Props to the Italians. - [Rico] It looks like So, just quickly show us - First of all, really cool feature, it is a fully stainless steel cabinetry. So, these are all stainless But look how stylish it looks. - [Rico] Yep. - I would've never thought to do that, but it's so beautifully done, the craftsmanship, that you cannot tell. So of course we have an It's all appliances, Gaggenau, and this is a griddle basically. Right? So, our hood extraction is right here. Then we have a very large oven underneath. Of course, we have a large sink. This is really neat. So, they've built in this upper storage, and there's LED lighting, which actually we had to turn off because it kept flickering in our camera. But with the beautiful logo right here, it's really nicely done. But this is gonna blow your mind, you ready for this? - [Rico] Let me guess, the fridge. - Well, yeah, I mean, kind of. - [Rico] What do you mean, &quot;kind of?&quot; - This is a proper explorer yacht, right? - [Rico] Yeah. - So, just a simple fridge. - [Rico] (gasps) No, you're kidding me. - Would not be enough. - [Rico] Are you serious? - So, they have, (gasping) it's cold. They have a fridge and a You see? They were partying last night. - [Rico] Oh, yeah. Some Rose left. (Victoria gasps) - Oh my God, it's cold in there. Wow! - [Rico] That is incredible. Didn't expect that at all. - Never seen it like that. Really really nicely done. - [Rico] So, of course, - Yes, so that looks like and then of course a coffee machine, and tons of storage. This yacht is operational, fully crewed, so I'm not gonna open anything, we're gonna fully respect the the privacy and you guys just gonna trust us. But I'm sure everything is, there's dishwasher, there's everything we need in this galley. Down this way, we have our crew area. We have crew mess, there are three cabins with double beds. And they asked us to it's off limits because There was a massive party last night, so somebody had to clean up, and then those people are So, we will let them sleep, but I am pretty sure, it's probably a really - [Rico] So, now, let's - Yes. - [Rico] Down below the guest cabins. - Oh, that's how you wanna do it. - [Rico] Yes. - As we walk in through this space, let's quickly point out these lights. They're also a unique feature - [Rico] Yes. So, they actually are so you see the metal strings here? - They're retractable. - [Rico] Yes, and they can go like you saw in the cockpit. - If you pop in right - [Rico] Okay. So, as you guys can see, they're up here in the frame, and then over there, they're down like a chandelier. - You will see them and the indirect lighting It is really recessed deep in there, so the lights really don blind you. It's a really soft nice light. Okay, quickly, we have this to ourselves. Let's pop in here, we have a pocket door right I'll let you do this, this is definitely - [Rico] So, we have a right here on display. Lockable. And ooh. - [Victoria] Ooh. - And we have a cigar storage right here. - [Victoria] Like a proper explorer, yeah. - How do we get invited here? - I don't know, we are here. Okay, real quick, really with somewhat a unique that the men will appreciate. Come on in, please. - [Rico] We get a hat? - No, not that, I think the gentlemen - [Rico] We have a urinal. - [Victoria] Exactly. Don't see that often in a yacht. - [Rico] Don't see that often. - In a day head, right? - Again, I think they like to party, they like to throw parties, kind of rings true here All right, let's close this up. I mean, what a window in a day head. - [Rico] I know, right. - Seriously. All right, let's go all the way down and check out the staterooms. As you guys can see, some very cool, signed. So, let's quickly run through, we're gonna start on our port side. We have double cabins here. I like how they did that, that's very cool. Also different. So, check this out, this is a twin cabin, of course there's a pullman right here, you can make it a three. Some very minimalistic but the colors, you'll see a lot of I feel like they really Same thing with the lights, look at this beautiful So, the closet right here, it's actually glass, so you can see through it but it's dark. I mean, it's just so unique. - [Rico] On all sides actually. - Completely. - [Rico] It's mirrored glass, which still lets you see Like, maybe 20%? - Yeah, got a special tint on it. - [Rico] We have a TV and flush into the wall. - Beautiful beautiful head. I love that they were able to accomplish to have this dark interior, but it does not, the boat does not feel dark. It still has plenty of natural light. Let's check out the shower. Definitely a nice two person shower here. - [Rico] Very tall. - This whole boat is so tall. I am 6'8&quot; with my arm all the way up, and it's 7'3&quot; maybe? What do you think? 7'4&quot;? Yeah, a basketball player would be very happy on this vessel. - [Rico] How cool is this - Yeah, it's beautiful. I mean, it's throughout the boat. - [Rico] Is that good for doing makeup? I don't know, but you can probably tell. - Yeah, I mean, it's a but it obviously has to be, oh actually, it's not in the middle, they placed it this way. - [Rico] No, no. - Yeah, I feel like this And I'm 5'7&quot;, I'm not that short. So, there's a pocket door All right, let's go kind So, unique as well, they have these stations There's coffee, there's sink, full service, there's probably a drink fridge I would assume somewhere as well. So yes, full service here. There's storage everywhere. That door goes where? - [Rico] This is our air conditioned, separately air conditioned AV rack here. All the amplifiers, some of the navigation equipment, all completely separately air conditioned. - So, if your main AC goes out, your navigation equipment still is cooled. - [Rico] Still gonna get cooled. - Yes. All right, so we have - [Rico] Yep, watertight - And then, let's go again check out the VIP state room. This is a huge desk actually built in with a massive TV. Wow. And movie nights here in bed, right? - [Rico] I really dig the - So interesting. I would've never thought but very cool. - [Rico] I believe there is a - Oh, that's possible. No, it's not, it's storage. - No, it's storage. - [Rico] It looked so thick, - No. Okay, so we have, but you see the lights, look, everything is integrated right here. But the feel of it, this Like it's a villa, right? - [Rico] Yep. - You don't necessarily when you're on this vessel. - [Rico] Very true. - Which I think what they Pops of colors everywhere, but such detail, I mean look at this And look, a matching Look, right behind you. - [Rico] Yep. - So cool. Of course, wardrobe. - [Rico] So now of course, the boat's name is &quot;Maverick,&quot; right? So, the inspiration of the entire boat, in terms of the styling, in terms of the themes, comes from the movie, &quot;Top - Yeah, the owners are so this is part of it. And when we go up, we'll tell you guys the story sorta behind this in the So, you have your wardrobe again, this beautiful glass, and there's some more storage. Walking into the head here, they actually have a dual vanity. Hey look, this is something Actually, on even on I'm still trying to figure out. There's actually a towel I feel like that's always just this thing that everybody forgets, but it's so important and it ends up laying everywhere. Beautiful shower. Fantastic four person shower. The finishes, it's just, wow. CdM, beautiful. - [Rico] All right, let's - All right, let's keep going. So, I'm gonna assume Yes. So, here's another VIP matching cabin. This is a great space, look, to work, to actually And then just to double check, a matching head, same And let's keep going and see the twin cabin, to - [Rico] Okay. - Matching that one. So, we're going back out here. Love this throw down The rugs. Okay, so this is exactly the same. Look at the size of the bulwarks there. The size of the walls. And of course. - [Rico] The hull thickness. - The hull thickness, sorry, the hull thickness, yeah, All right, fantastic here. - [Rico] Completely matching. - Yeah, same. Let's go up one deck and show you the VIP stateroom. All right, and now we're walking No, it's not the owner's suite, just wait. So we have a wardrobe A large desk very big, actually, two people can - [Rico] Very comfortably. - I love how they left it open. Look at the size of the windows. Insane. This whole space is so open. But the vibrancy of colors it's so interesting. So of course, we have a walk-in closet Queen-sized bed or king-sized? - [Rico] King-sized. - King-sized. Really? Oh yeah, the pillows. Actually but yeah, king-sized bed here. Beautiful full size mirror, and then let's pop into the en suite. A separate head. - [Rico] Fantastic. - Very nice. Of course, beautiful, this is just such a nice detail. - [Rico] Yep. - Such a pretty light. Also a nice night light. And of course, I'm gonna say, like a three person shower Very nice. Okay, we're gonna go one deck up. (Victoria gasps) Do you see this art? - [Rico] Yeah, it's like a 3D art, which is following you - [Victoria] Now go like Oh, this is so cool. - [Rico] I hope it comes out in the video. - [Victoria] Does it? You can't see on the screen? - [Rico] It's completely 3D. - [Victoria] Wow. Super cool. - [Rico] So trippy. - [Victoria] Very very trippy. Okay, going up one deck. - [Rico] To the owner's deck. I think we have it all to ourselves. You guys are ready for this? This is crazy. Literally crazy. First, you walk in and there's actually, it's own little, almost 'cause you have a sink, and then you have a coffee machine. I mean, if you just. - [Rico] There's a fridge there, huh? Is it? No, washer and dryer. - What? A washer and dryer. So, fully self-sufficient. I feel like there's gotta be a fridge. Yes, there's a fridge right here. So you're literally self-sufficient. You can just be like, you know what, I'm not leaving my room today, I can feed myself, I can make a coffee. Come on in. - [Rico] And we have a to close the space up, make it completely private. - Okay, have you ever, I mean ever seen an - [Rico] No. - This is ridiculous. It is probably the coolest I've ever seen. You have, what is it, 270 degree, what is it, 180, no, no is it 180? No, it's 180 if you're in - [Rico] 200 degree or - This is the center of the room, yeah. I mean, definitely like a 200 degree view. I mean, this is crazy. Technically, your own private space when nothing needs to be done. You can just be like, hey, This is crazy. Look at the design, it's so beautiful. The nightstands are gorgeous. It's just, the colors, I absolutely love it. But there is way more to love. - [Rico] So, just to quickly mention that we have two sliding doors, one on the starboard side, one on the port side. We have the side decks moved outboard, so we have a larger side deck, completely private owner's terrace. - Well, we're gonna go forward in a moment when we go outside. So, just so you guys understand, the plan for this yacht, the mission, is to spend seven years onboard cruising. So, they need a good livable space. - [Rico] What? - That brings me to my closet. (laughs) - [Rico] Wow. - You need to have a good closet Check this out. I will never leave. Really, will never leave. This is absolutely stunning. This is the coolest wardrobe Sorry other yachts. This just knocks it outta the park. And the view, what? - [Rico] Unbelievable. - Yes. So, this has to be a comfortable space, if they're gonna live in. So, they sacrificed the sky and they had some specific things that they wanted out of it. So, they already have a seven year plan, we'll show it to you. They've already been cruising so this journey is already going. So, what's here? - [Rico] There's a head. - (Victoria gasps) Wow, And the lights automatically come up. - [Rico] Oh, I can see that. - Very nicely, just very light. Super cool. Okay, so we have a head here. Wow, this door is serious door. Okay, then what's this? - [Rico] Another one. - Another head. Two heads. What? Two heads. Never have to wait for the other person, never have to if they went to the restroom and you wanna use the you have your own restroom. Love that. - [Rico] The original &quot;Top Gun.&quot; One of my favorite movies. - Yeah, original poster. Okay, let's go aft. This is still continuation I cannot call this a head, it's clearly a stunning, - [Rico] That is a beautiful bathtub. - Absolutely stunning. The windows, the views that you have here. Imagine you're at anchor and you wanna be able to take it's just wow. They really went outside of No limitations, they didn't care what anybody would think, they just wanted it their own, and I think they just absolutely Beautiful one sink, massive sink. Still with plenty of This is special. What? Again, first one, never Look at this view. - [Rico] Look at the grand shower head. - Look at the views. Of course, you have a shade, some of you don't freak out, you can close the shade if you want to. But if you're onboard, and this is your private You have jets here. - [Rico] Oh, and it's a steam sauna too. - Yeah, steam sauna. Exactly. Wow. So cool. - [Rico] Beautiful. - So cool. So, then, this room was really important and special to the owners. Their youngest child has down syndrome, special needs kid, and they wanted to make sure they had a really really Part of the reason that they've decided to go on this journey to travel the world, is to show Phil, who has you guys can follow him, to show him the world, to be able to expand his horizons, to see what's out there. And they're huge advocates down syndrome kids out there, so they're really passionate about bringing awareness to this subject. I think this room is spectacular. - [Rico] And no better with a proper explorer yacht - Aw, look at the play space. There's a work desk, I mean, it's such a nice space. He's got his own couch. I would love this room when - [Rico] It feels so cozy, and of course it being close - Still private but super close. Let's go show you the private aft terrace. - [Rico] Oh, wow. - Check out this space. Have you ever seen a swing Check this out. - [Rico] This is crazy. - I mean, wow. The colors, I absolutely love it. Of course, it's a loose it can all be changed around, put away. If you get sick of the purple, you can make it blue, doesn't matter. - [Rico] And it has anchor so underway, if it gets too rough, you just anchor the swing in. - Oh, I was wondering how they did that. - [Rico] Yes. - And again, retractable lights so super cool spot to hang out at night. - [Rico] Integrated speakers everywhere. So, I think we should ask, when we're done filming, if we can get a little demonstration. - Maybe. We could do that. All right, let's go all the way forward. All right, check this out. These are the balconies, the extended terraces So, they actually extended the deck here, it comes out, you could see, when the bulwarks are down, I think it's. - [Rico] Oh, wow. - It's similar space. But yes, this whole space, they wanted to create a terrace, you can actually put some chairs, a table, and actually hang out here. So, it's not just, if you think about it, a waste of space. Of course, it's really important but they're not usable. Here, you can put some furniture, and actually enjoy the spaces. And you have two of them, right? - [Rico] Mm-hmm. - So, when you're entertaining- - [Rico] How about the as courtesy light? - Beautiful. - [Rico] How cool does that look? - Absolutely beautiful. This yacht last night was a shining star. It looked so pretty. Wow. So, here as well, while what's this? I don't know what this is. Oh, is it an ice bucket? You think it's an ice bucket? - [Rico] Well, it has a drain, yeah. - Yeah, two drains. I think you put ice in it That would be my guess. We're gonna find out hopefully but you guys put in the comments, what do you think this is? We'll try to find out. - [Rico] So, full private owner's terrace. - Yes, but of course, if you wanna have guests what I was trying to say, is you actually could have different spaces, right? Some people can hang out here, and let's say somebody and have a private conversation, you can have a separate spot setup there with a table and some chairs. And another one on the other side. So, it allows to have this Really really cool. - [Rico] Very true. It looks like we have speakers and maybe somebody planned ahead already to extend the amount of speakers, because it looks like for potential speakers. - Okay, that would be pretty mental. I gotta say. Only you, I thought it's only you who can do this. - [Rico] Nope. - Yes, but, but there are other that's good to know that - [Rico] So, walking all the way forward, we do have our anchor equipment here. Big bollards. Look at the space in the bulwarks. How big these are. I mean, you can stick and look at your anchor. - Hundred percent, yes. Very comfortable. - [Rico] We got our two The big anchor plate. - It's hot? - [Rico] No, it's solid. - It's so so solid. - [Victoria] Okay, careful, please. - Yep. Carefully going in here. - [Victoria] Look, I don't he just volunteers to go in. - Into our anchor locker. Oh, wow, are you kidding me? Welcome to the anchor locker. Guys, there's a workbench in here. - [Victoria] No way. - [Rico] There's a whole Wow, this is incredible. Look at this, all nicely neatly organized. Whole workbench in here. We're all the way in the bow. These are the pipes here and the anchor's obviously in the pocket sitting right there. We have a anchor chain wash when we raise the anchor Here's our chain storage, all the way down there. We got more equipment here, got some air condition here, might be the air makeup unit actually. And then it goes deeper with more storage capabilities. I mean, look at this, this is incredible. And then we have the Lots of space, so much space for additional storage, it's absolutely incredible. We got the windlass remote Then we go back up, I don't see anything. - [Victoria] Do you even want to leave? - [Rico] It's amazing. - [Victoria] Is it air conditioned? - It feels cool in there. Maybe. - Wow, incredible. - [Victoria] Yeah? - [Victoria] So impressive. Okay. - [Rico] So, going back aft. - [Victoria] Yes. - [Rico] And we get to show you another extremely cool feature, very unique on this yacht. - What? - [Rico] The crow's nest. - Ahh, the crow's nest. One more deck. More surprises. All right, welcome to our top deck. Normally, it'd be called the sun deck, on this yacht, I think it's a little bit. - [Rico] On this yacht, - It's a bridge deck, yeah, it's a bit different. Again, the design is so different. - [Rico] Check this out here, I have this whole walkway around here, all the way aft with - [Victoria] I have a We have our jetted tub here as well. - [Rico] Wow, look at the view. - So high up. - [Rico] Look at this view. - [Victoria] Wow. - [Rico] That is incredible. - But definitely, you need you think, a Right? - [Rico] Yep. - They actually had their DJ booth on top of the transformer, facing this way so his one was up, the DJ was up, and then everybody was partying there.

Then right here, we have actually a unique We have a eight people, actually could even be nine, because this ladder is But we have a high seating Then this custom bar, And look at this, you have a little layout area right here, that whole sitting area there. There are sun shade poles in those spots, so you can shade this whole area as well. There is another bar with a sink and I'm sure you've got Oh, wait a minute. There is actually a barbecue right here. - [Rico] This is so unique, this whole design of this bar element. Following of course, the other bar elements we have And look at the shape of the sink, it's so cool. Where did you go? Oh. What's there? - I found a napping spot. A secret spot that you and nobody will find you. - [Rico] That is so cool. - This is probably the - [Rico] How amazing is this - You just wanna read a this is the spot. - [Rico] Really cool. - I mean, if the lunch is served, you will probably miss it, because nobody will find you to tell you.

We are so high up here, - [Rico] Look at this what is this, like a 12 footer? And then there's a second one above that. Of course, all electronics mast. We have our search light up there as well. Wow, wow, wow. Incredible. - Pops of color here as well. Everywhere, they're just with the details. Okay, shall we go down? - [Rico] So, just this one here, has this actually gets stopped in and just sucks it in. And hull number two has an - Yep, this was sort of when they did this. You know those change orders? You know how that happens? - [Rico] Aye, aye, aye. - Yeah, the NBBL all of a sudden, like, ooh, let's do a crow's nest, and then on hull #2, they were like, oh we would and then they build in the staircase. Okay, shall we? - [Rico] Yes. - Okay, you go first. - [Rico] Okay. - And you can catch me if I fall. - [Rico] Well, if you fall, - [Victoria] Yeah, I'll just - That is incredible. (upbeat music) - Okay, let's go in. First of all, quickly, we're gonna show you the Captain's cabin. - [Rico] Okay. - So, he has a large XL single Got a window. There's a hanging locker right here. It's compact, but it is an So, I think it's a bit of a trade-off. He's right next to the pilot house. There's a really good size shower, at least a one and a half person shower, or one person and a labradoodle. - [Rico] Same finish as - Yes, very nice. Super super cool. All right, as we're walking out, we do have a little work station here. Great working space for a - [Rico] And then here, we actually see the map, the planned route. - [Victoria] Route, yeah. - [Rico] The planned route. - [Victoria] Seven year plan. - [Rico] Correct. - What this boat is going to do. - [Rico] So, the cruise is starting after the Monaco Yacht Show in October, going all the way around all the way going up to up to the arctic area. Then over to Iceland, Greenland. Wow, this is crazy. Down to Bermuda. - [Victoria] Okay, when Let's see, when they in the Bahamas? - [Rico] Caribbean, Cuba, 11/28 to 2/29. - [Victoria] Yeah, but - [Rico] Oh, yeah. - [Victoria] Yeah. Hey! We should be there, hopefully they meet up. - [Rico] Can we buddy boat? - Yeah, that would be awesome. - [Rico] And there it says, - [Victoria] The map displays only the first four and a half years. What? - Okay, let's go check out the helm. - [Rico] Cool. - We're walking into the helm. To the bridge actually. It's bigger than a helm. - [Rico] Welcome to the bridge deck. This is, aw, very interesting, so we got two helm chairs, both are movable, slidable Then, there is a bench behind, right? - Yes, so this is so if this seat's all the way back, there's a way to put this seat down, but you can pop it up and you have a nice two - [Rico] This must've been - [Victoria] I think so, yeah, I think so. - [Rico] Right? - [Victoria] Yeah. - [Rico] Really really cool. I would put that up there too. We have our yacht management with all our land monitoring as well. We got the Furuno equipment for the depth sounder. This is cool here, got all right u underneath that. And then of course here behind is the main staircase. - Yeah, I actually, you said of course, I was gonna say, I've We've never seen. - [Rico] True. - That light allowance of that light coming down the staircase. It's a very interesting design choice. And of course, there's a shade there, right up there, so you can close it up, and make it dark in here. - [Rico] Especially for night passengers. - But instead of putting a hard big wall, they just made it really really nice, and kinda airy feel here. All right, let's run through the helm. - [Rico] Run through the helm. So, welcome to the helm. We have our overhead panel here, with most of their Furuno equipment. Then, we have one, two, three, four, five very large screens here. We have only one on right now. It shows the CCTV footage. We have got our Furuno remote Again, Furuno keyboad here. We have our shift and Horn control. Independent steering Rudder indicators right there. Autopilot control. We have our bow thruster Another keyboard for the Furuno system. Remote control for the Furuno system. Windshield wiper control. Another keyboard there for the PC. Everything right at your fingertips. Right below here, we have and some more electronics - Yeah, a really nice helm here. Okay, there's some more stuff here. - Yes, so we have our indicators here for the navigation lights, as well as service emergency battery indicators. - All right, how about, docking here? - [Rico] Oh, wow. These are just wing stations. You know what? We are so high up, because technically we on the sun deck, right? - [Victoria] Yep. - Which became the bridge deck, so not only would it be one level lower, so underway, being able you're so high up, most likely not getting any spray if there's even a little You're so high up, you can actually travel with shut down the air conditioner, and then we have our wing - [Victoria] How does it work? - Which fold up this way. So now, my visibility becomes I can see all the way even if the bulwarks are folded up, I can still see the And then here, we open this up, this is where our, I'm just our wing station is exactly got a thrift throttle controls, got our bow thruster control, steering control, rudder indicators here, as well as a Raymarine which in this case, is showing us the wind And of course, our own speed as well, emergency shutoffs for the main engines, and a horn switch, just in case somebody's while you try to dock and - [Victoria] Okay, close it up. - Close this back up. This is serious here. - [Victoria] Are you excited? - Excited? Yes. Why? - [Victoria] Where we going next? - I don't know, where we going next? - [Victoria] The engine room. - Yes, very excited. Lazarette and engine room and beach club. - [Victoria] This is one - One engine room. - This is one special engine room. (upbeat music) Okay, go ahead. - [Rico] Okay, so we also unusual spot actually, because usually we see one back up. We have a quick connect shower here. A little bench, which Of course, this one is covered right now, 'cause we have the passer rail out. So, no, this is. - [Victoria] Yeah, unique feature, they kinda thought it would be nice to be able to have a little sit down spot when people are swimming, when the transformer is down in the water, and so you still have. - Everybody hanging out - [Victoria] Yeah, you putting chairs out, you - So, this is a cool spot, where you can actually how it normally would tuck away. This is opening up and closing up, and then the A-frame crane goes down. So what I was mentioning earlier, with the bulwarks being able to fold down because of the mooring equipment, they moved the mooring equipment kind of like you would I think it's a brilliant idea, it's very easy to maneuver because you can easily just step off, even onto a dock or a jetty. Everything is right here. We have the tunnel right - [Victoria] Yeah, this It comes out. - It comes out on the swim pad form. - They have this rub rail if you guys can see. It looks really nice and slick as well. - So then of course, we have which is now up, that's our it opens up, it opens up the space whatever you want it to be. - Okay, ready for this? - [Rico] Another dance area. - Yes. So, this space is also convertible. They do have a gym here, you can take it apart, put it away. So, on this side, it's neat, look, they have a little table that disappears, if you don't want it. This whole space could be closed in. These doors, you can close it up. So, there's a sink here, Fridge right here for your drinks when everybody's swimming. Very convenient. And even have a sofa here. Why? Because you can hang out, look, you can see that this pops out. - [Rico] Yep. - And have a really nice layout area here to be able to watch movies. - [Rico] So, again, of course, speakers in here, and then this is a dropdown screen, like you said, to watch movies. - Amazing, right? - [Rico] Really cool. Really cool. - Okay, it's not all. 'Cause right here, carefully, just peering enough, we do have a day head with a shower. So, you can actually workout, shower off, and then go up to your Hooks. - [Rico] Or if you don't want to shower off on the transom for some reason, you come out the ocean, there's a shower here too. - Maybe you want to properly shower. - [Rico] Yes. - That's pretty cool. So, as you guys can tell, here's our pool that we saw from upstairs. Right now, it's closed. - [Rico] Check out the light which comes in to the beach club, when the pool is open. The sun shines in, it looks beautiful. Besides, it would look very funny too, if there's actually and you can see it right from here. That's incredible. Look at the light which comes in here. - All right, now, some technical This is a dedicated laundry, a real proper laundry room with three sets of Three sets. And you saw another set and there's another set - [Rico] Wow. - Yeah, they know laundry is important. Well, they've got four kids, right? Place to be able to actually Properly set up. Okay, I'm gonna let Rico show you this. - So then underneath the floor, we have these panels which and then we have crane which is carbon fiber, so it can be lifted out and then installed somewhere on the deck to also not having to - [Victoria] Like, for example, in the bow area. - [Rico] Correct. - [Victoria] Then, there comes - [Rico] Oh, got more pumps there. - [Victoria] Oh, it's - [Rico] It's actually open to each other. - [Victoria] Yeah, what? - [Rico] So, let's go over, - Ah, you guys, I'm gonna His eyes light up. He gets so excited. - Before we got in, we have some jet boards How cool, look at the weights, How cool is this? Okay, let's go, not engine room. - [Victoria] Not engine room. - Not engine room, technical So, first of all, we have for the shore power. Umbrella storage. Really nice. Well done. Flipper storage right there. - [Victoria] Flipper? - Yeah, flipper. Flippers. We got our snorkels here, regulators, regulators, regulators. All our dive gear. Check this out. - [Victoria] Ta-da! - Dive tanks. - [Victoria] Yep, purpose-build, you guys. Purpose-built. - [Rico] Wow. Follow me. Right here, we have our Separate air condition units right there. Our water maker. There's even a vacuum cleaner. - [Victoria] It's great. - [Rico] So, this is the big for the A-frame crane. And now, we're going to the engine room. - The technical space could which is really nice, it's separate from the engine room, and it allows, because the frequency allows the space to be so you're not constantly and this space, so a really great resolution - So, now, drum roll, you guys ready? Let's check out the - [Victoria] Been ready, been waiting. (gentle music) - Looks like a church. (Victoria laughs) (Victoria singing) Okay, let's pray. Wow. - Check this out. This is crazy. - [Victoria] Can you look at No, go over there, please. - I cannot touch the ceiling. This is incredible. - [Victoria] Can you - No. - [Victoria] No. He's on his tippy toes. - No, I cannot touch the ceiling. - [Victoria] He cannot touch the ceiling. - Wow, this is unbelievable. So, we got two C32 main engine Of course, have our transmission and PTO's for the hydraulic system. So then, we see tankage already on and above the level of the engine room, of the engine room floor actually. Two large generators equally, one smaller generator right in front there as a third generator. We have the staircase. - [Victoria] You're really fast. Here, take the camera. You're way too fast. - [Rico] Oh, I see, I see. - [Victoria] I can't point - [Rico] So, we got two main generators slightly raised on top This is a dream to do service on. - Yeah? - [Rico] I mean, you don't bend down, nothing. You can just literally open the panel and do your service on Fantastic. So, we got more pumps there. Look at those exhaust systems. This is incredible. We have the staircase coming to get up and down into the engine room. A massive workbench, which is on top of the main - [Victoria] It's brilliant. - [Rico] Got a little fold down sink here. Our electrical panel all the way aft. We have the generators controls there, shore power, invertor control, all the main breaker switches, high voltage breaker switches, as well as some of the low voltage breakers. We got our black water treatment and gray water bleach Now, moving to the center, this is one of the shocks, the bow shock actually, - The amount of space, I don't understand how they did it. How did they have so They still have a beach club, this whole technical space, and this massive engine room. As we were chatting with Carlo, he said that the way they is they start with the engine room and then they build it up. So once they're happy with how the engine room's gonna look, a space that's needed to make it CdM standard worthy engine room, then they build the rest of the boat up. - [Rico] That's right. - And you can tell, it shows. - [Rico] So, moving over we have more equipment here that you see right now. So, we have another chiller over there, we have some domatic air Engine room ventilation, which brings in some So, now moving forward in the this is really cool. Okay, check this out, guys. So first of all, We have accessibility to our valves, not just from here, also from the top, there are openings everywhere. Engine mount right down here. Primary fuel filters and oil filters, also very easy to reach. And more primary fuel filters down here. So now, I'm gonna turn around, we have a water tight door here, and now check this out. This is the corridor in going to all the way forward and up with access to the crew quarters and with access to the anchor locker. Of course, we have some water This corridor is very important, it makes it easy when the need to be serviced and inspected. These are all the access hatches here, the service hatches, which are bolted on of course. But when the service is due, when the inspection is due, it's very convenient to instead of taking the So, this is amazing. - [Victoria] Oh, okay. - Great, great access. So as you guys can see, like I mentioned already down below, everything can open up. - [Victoria] Wow. - [Rico] You have access You just jump into the bilge. We have storage down there for additional lubrication containers. It's really really easy to and the people which work Since I'm already touching those, we have crates everywhere and there's space for crates everywhere. - [Victoria] Have you - So, storing spare parts. - Tools. There's lots of space on here for the engineer to work around. Obviously, the workbench, - [Victoria] Love, love, love - [Rico] When you close it. - [Victoria] How beautiful? Wow! Okay, anything else that - This is the sight glass for Amazing engine room. This concludes the tour - What? I hope you guys enjoyed it. - Make sure you hit that like button.
