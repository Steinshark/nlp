I have built the most and my friend Mack here is attempting to complete it Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much We are currently hundreds of feet Look at that. And this is just absolutely insane obstacle courses And if Mack completes all six of the He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I And of course, I have to make it There's double swinging hammers You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete if he wants to walk away Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before, Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails 100 feet into a net, and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one. Winning God, dude. All right, it looks like he's This is scary to watch him Once he starts dangling on that Let's see if he locks No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who he's actually a contestant Even though he tragically lost He's been a massive crowd favorite, one final chance to redeem himself Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video, have all been about strength, But this level is going to test Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it You have exactly 30 minutes perfectly, and if you accidentally your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don't! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button If you're not confident in your next step, Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes - I don't need that. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles. All right, here we go. - Okay. - Not I'm not confident. - Okay. I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning I want to remind you, to win this 800 grand. If you lose again, Is it the forward one or Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know. It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating that an individual attempt was no matter what he tried. He continued to forget It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check I thought that was it. The only way I could go I think it's... - Mack? Remember how you felt Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over his decision to return to the start But when Mack was finally confident - Right, two. Okay, this is it. He was faced with an extremely tight Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. - Godspeed. I can literally feel my heart This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump! There's no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways, Come on. Now, this next level but I know for a fact This... ... is level four. And even though this course the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish So therefore Tell me. You can attempt to do this and if you fall in the water, Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it, Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost So it's a good thing he's holding on Yeah, we're going to be here all night. So it's about dang time I just remembered, you're Even though you to know that Feastables I need you to wear one so you don't Whatever you do, don't drop that's available You can also buy Feastables using What is this? There's only one way to find out. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break Mack, the only thing standing between are these not big red balls. I called them that, And these balls are so much harder that we brought some other creators And let's just say I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that We've been going so long starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him Hold on! I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. - Watch out! Watch your step. Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's. This level, you could probably tell You see? Balance has been a trouble for you You even declined the balance beam You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling So now you'll have to cross not one, and get all eight And if you fall once, just once, And before you do this challenge, You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when Just pull the lever. - There's no way. - No! no, no, no! Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just I'm not gonna lie. This is wild. You will be not human Oh my gosh. We're so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them, In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third I don't know if I've ever actually said No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet, you're just stalling Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is. I'm going to go for it. Yes! And the final piece that I haven't told Mack You're free to move with whatever Or if you're feeling risky, He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags. You're coming In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul which you just screw one which allows you to make your water You can also adjust the flavor So if you set it to three, But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which I have an idea. Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's - That's four. Dude, I just wish Cirkul actually has Okay. Welcome back. See you. just go to your local Walmart because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever All right, Karl, Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing Every one of these Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out? Do you want to just Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing Or once again, grab the last Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across. Because I almost didn't He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off. Take a second, bro. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this? - Let's bring it home, huh? Think about your All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you And because you've been through a lot and not only this video, drowning, boulders, lasers, I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know I know exactly I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing There is no turning back. Every single challenge All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier, Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you They're down there - Go Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes. This next contraption Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit He can go up and down, or he can And in case you forgot, We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter and you're going to need your This one is all about when you Basically, Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend If he gets hit, there's - What are you doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That's gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier However, considering the history I just couldn't resist I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough, cookie gets exponentially smaller And the only thing between and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack Remember, the cookies get smaller Don't let this be the moment Because it's As you can see, this bar is outside And if he misses it midair, it's One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save - Yes. Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have Fail here and the chance to be lifted will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah! - Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle The umbrella. It's do or die. Or the saga ends Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump. Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this. Just so you know, Wait. Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes! - You did it. After three tries. For the first time he is holding - Yes! What are you gonna spend I've got three friends of mine, They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. I did it mom. Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000. Congrats man.
