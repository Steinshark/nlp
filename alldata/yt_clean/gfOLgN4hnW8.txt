If not, I'd like to go. - [Grant] You're not tell me where the device is. - And why would I do that? - Because it's mine. - That's debatable. Your father commissioned not destroy them. - It will save lives, American - You voided your contract to the tech when you decided-- to think so. you've mandated. that of yours? the wrong hands. - Tell me where it is! (clears throat) What? - Lopez managed to restore 78% of the data from the purge, sir. - And the device? - We're locked in on its tracking beacon. - Excellent. (light music) - So, what exactly are we looking for? - Anything. Everything, clues, signs, - Uh, I'm hungry. - No problemo. - What do you have in there? Beans, really? A flashlight? Candy.

You must have a power button. (door thudding) - [Randy] James, I'm home. - Great. - Let's go, I'm starving. - Coming! (birds chirping) - Did you find it? - Uh, well, actually sir, - [Grant] Bring the device - Well, actually, sir, you see, the beacon was disconnected - Well, why would you do that? - Uh, no, sir, you see, prior to us finding the device. We suspect that it may - All right. Look, I'll have a chat with Ms. Palmer and you two clowns stop messing Show me. (warping) (light country music) - Oh my god.

(sighs) What now? - Well. How confident are you that this thing is actually trying to protect you? - [James] I know what I saw. (dramatic music) (beeping) - What the heck? (dramatic music) - How much longer are we gonna do this? - Until you decide to cooperate. - Sir, we recovered 91.1% of the data. - What about the other 9.9%? - 8.9. - What? - 8.9%. 91.1% would leave you 8.9% - Uh, so now you wanna be helpful? - Butt out, Lopez. - Yes, sir. - So now you're being helpful, hm? - It's simple math. - There's been some - What do you mean? - I'm not sure yet. We won't know until we or a series of protocols to show how the prototype's capabilities - So why don't we just Hey, fly it back here. - Ah, yes, the raven protocol. Great job, sir. - Do it. - Right away. (beeping) - All right. Three, two, one. (dramatic music) - What the? - [F.R.E.D.I.] Activating Raven Protocol. - Whoa. - Are you seeing what I'm seeing? - It's flying. - [F.R.E.D.I.] Unable to I will run a self-diagnostic One moment, please.

I hadn't noticed. - Yeah. They're saying you jumped and nearly got Bruce arrested. - Technically Bruce nearly with a little help from F.R.E.D.I.. - Wait, did F.R.E.D.I. go after Bruce? - [F.R.E.D.I.] It was - F.R.E.D.I., shh. - You brought that thing to school? - I just, yeah, it's fine. It's a half-day. - [F.R.E.D.I.] Each solar - Quiet. - James, this is bad, okay? Do you not get that? This is some sort of defense bot. People are gonna come looking for it. - [James] I'm not gonna let them find her and I'm not giving her back. - Did you bump your head doing that stupid stunt this morning? I'm just curious. - I've never felt better. This is the best day of my life and I don't intend on wasting it. - Hey, sweet move, bro. - Oh. Hey, you wanna come with me after school to see what F.R.E.D.I. can do? - I can't. Me and the science class are So I'm tutoring students after And I actually wanted to talk to you about who exactly I'm tutoring. - [James] Yeah, who is it? - It's, it's, it's a girl. - Well, well, well, nice going, brother.

Look, excuse the interruption, but I've been running some tests on the virtual model of F.R.E.D.I. and um-- - Move. You've been doing what? - Running some tests - Well that sounds like and resources, isn't it? - With all due respect, wanna take a look at this. - Am I? See, right here. So, back in phase one of this um, this virtual model that we can do some, you know, - Hypothetic goal testing without any real work consequences. Well, why in the real world would I even care about any of this? It is the question, isn't it? - Yes, that is - A good question and I See, this is the model that the F.R.E.D.I. prototype uses for the fuel cell along system that we in place for a stabilizing. Well, it appears that (dramatic music) - All right, without all just tell me what you - Well, um, see, the lower the numbers go, the faster it drops. We call it the Omega Error. - Ooh, the Omega Error. Oh, I do like the sound of that. Has a certain ring to it, doesn't it? Omega Error. What happens when it - Oh no, everything within (chuckling) - Sounds wonderful. - Uh huh, wonderful? - Well, it would be-- - [F.R.E.D.I.] Why are we in the forest? - I wanted to take you out for a spin.

Are you hurt? - [F.R.E.D.I.] F.R.E.D.I.'s power cell capacity is depleted by half. Someone is approaching. I will scan the area. Scan complete. I detect two individuals Their bioscans are logged in my database. - Let's go. - [Brody] Hey, Williams, get over here. - What do ya got? What is this? - [Brody] I don't know, - [Williams] How did - [F.R.E.D.I.] I detect an consistent with extreme stress. - Quiet! (phone ringing) - Hello? Sir, is that you? Sir, I can't hear you, you're breaking up. It sounds like you want to release her. Really? Oh, right away. - [Williams] What's up? - Grant wants to release Palmer. - We need to go. - [F.R.E.D.I.] Okay. - Who are those people? - [F.R.E.D.I.] F.R.E.D.I. them during my field trials. - Is that where you came from? And don't tell me it's classified. - [F.R.E.D.I.] I won't - So tell me. - [F.R.E.D.I.] I can't. - Fine, I'll look it up myself.

I've decided. We're going to let her go. She's not giving us anything anyway. - [Brody] Yeah, so just let her go again. - [Grant] Exactly. And then I want you to - [Williams] Right, before she heads straight to the gadget. - [Grant] That's what I'm counting on. (engine rumbling) - Yeah, you know, that's super helpful. I totally get it now. - Yeah, uh, there's a ton Here, see these phylum classifications? It looks really overwhelming but if you break them and nonvertebrae and in which they reside it's and attack it that way. So let's start-- - Yeah, of course. Isn't that why I'm getting - Um, what's the deal - I am, I don't know. What do you mean? - You know, like is he single, (laughing) - James? - I was just asking. You know, for a friend.

I'll show you how to be patient. (dramatic music) - F.R.E.D.I.? F.R.E.D.I.? Where are you? F.R.E.D.I.? F.R.E.D.I.? (dramatic music) - Oh, you mustn't reshelve you'll muddle the system. Let me do it. - F.R.E.D.I.. - Young man, this is a - Yes, ma'am, sorry about that. (zapping) How'd you do that? - [F.R.E.D.I.] F.R.E.D.I. is equipped with a cloaking device to evade detection in hostile circumstances. - Amazing. - [F.R.E.D.I.] Caution, Omega Error. Current power 45%. - Hey, I found a burst of originating from an IP I'm headed over there now. Yeah. Bye. - Yeah, no, no, you're Just keep doing, keep doing that. Real simplified. - I need to talk to you, like now. - Can you not wait until we're done? Come on. - No, it's okay, we And I could give you guys a ride home in my car if you'd like. - You have a car?
