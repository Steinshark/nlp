This is our new home I've showed it in videos before and I think that really rings true. It's big It's grand and in the fashion of homes built in the 90s like this, It is DUM Kind of like Jekyll here. Big and D U M DUM At least by today's standards. I mean, in the 1990s this probably would have been considered It has one of these things. An intercom system capable of with communicating with the front door, the master bedroom, the spare that isn't there... The switch for the lights out or on a schedule to go on and off These stairs have these cove lights without ruining your night vision. So if you're coming down for midnight But of course, tech marches on and things that are once relevant This intercom system And having this button directly When we get deliveries, half the time And I think it's probably because that's a little more prominent. I mean, Gregor here, is ornamental only. I mean, Gregor here is ornamental only, And these stair lights are actually kind of frustrating because if you're trying to head up in the night and they're off, the switch And of course, since this is MandicReally, a little army of robots, and help us with a pile of other tech I have a couple of notes if you're interested in smart home stuff, Now we'll talk about each individual component But I purchased all of this myself BigTreeTech sent that over, The rest of these items a couple of them DEEP discounts on from my local utility They're incentivizing us to move to and thus reduce So really look into what might have on offer, and it might push you over the edge like it did me with this stuff Our projects is going to start here rack, as the main hub of this whole new powered with this BigTreeTech Pad7. not only a Klipper pad! though, 90 plus percent of these are being used For anybody who's not familiar, Klipper is a firmware operating system and you can run it off of this This is a CB1, but we're going to be taking that out for Some of you may already be aware of where we're headed with this, but The reason we're swapping out the for a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 is we're going to be running Home This is an open source, Linux to tie together a ton of different It's intended for and runs we're not going to cover installing home There's plenty of write ups and guides What we are going to talk about later in and automations that I set up for the hardware that I'm running, I want to get this hardware physically mounted up in my Dell server I have this video sponsor, Phaetus! They have a range of new products you folks to know about. They've got new hot end nozzles If you have a Bambu X1 or P1 3d printer, and Conch Plus hot ends. These have silicon carbide tips on them That's a very tough, hard material against the carbon fiber VERY well, and stay nice / consistent The Conch Plus also has their patented break for even more wear resistance These also feature mechanically There are two screws coming from either side so if you're hot and crashes, of bending the hot end, You can remove that without having to remove the heat Next up we have the APUS 2 extruder. This is a 5.8 to 1 gear reduction extruder For a compact This has an internal filament so if you run out of filament, it breaks, you have that sensor right there. No add-ons hanging off the side And RNC2 coated gears for high wear This is designed to keep up with high flow hot ends, Last but most certainly not least, we have the SiC nozzle So you're Prusa Mk4, Mk3.9, Mk4S, or XL. this has a silicon carbide tip, in the heat brake for that long wear These are also available So your K1 series and Ender And if you're interested check out the links in the description to see the new things Thank you to them again For our project We're going to be loading up It was just the easiest one And using that SiC Nextruder nozzle Diving back in the way that I'm going rack is with this 4U blanking plate. This will install into my regular And I'm going to mount the pad Obviously that's not very simple. There's there's no hole in this. So I'm going to create one. Starting as so many of my projects do. With one of my favorite tools, Blue Painter's Tape, just to mark Now I jumped into Fusion mounting system While I was doing that, lay on to this new steel plate, where my holes are going to be drilled for the Pad7 to pass through this, A jigsaw is not necessarily the first tool but it is the one I currently have a compressor in the new studio yet. Then it was over to my Prusa Mk4 with that SiC nozzle So we could print this Eryone PETG-CF for the Pad7 to that blanking plate. This actually installs on the with a couple of M3 screws. And then the Pad7 presses in from the front and bolts in from the sides to its original I also, while I had filament loaded for the CM4 and a 30mm fan Now taking up four server rack units does seem a bit excessive, all the way so I still have room to mount something Maybe another Pad7, another display, so it's not solely dedicated to my Home Now, with Home we can focus on the devices starting with replacing this dunce First problem I noticed is the holes spacing than the Ecobee thermostat So I need something to cover those up. Luckily, I can measure fairly quickly and design up a trim piece This is natural color ASA filament This is just plain ASA, nozzle doesn't have to be used on hard It can be used on pretty much anything. A little bit of print time later, to install on the wall and then allow us to mount the Ecobee the look a little bit. Ruby has already questioned piece and wants to paint it So hey, that's on my future To-Do list. Now I didn't mention why The number one reason was my local gave me a BIG discount on it. I was able to order it directly from them which no other thermostat was coming in at that price point That was THE deciding factor. Now, next I By the way, if you hear any background And it is a rule of thumb But if you want to film something, somebody will be leaf blowing dealing with an entirely dumb doorbell The doorbell does work, so I'm just going to be because I'm going to be installing Being part of the Unifi Protect system. This is a video doorbell. So it's going to be part It's going to be able to detect people being left on the stoop, as well but also allowing me to talk and converse I did have to do a prep step. My transformer was the wrong voltage I had to replace that with a 24 volt unit, but that was pretty straightforward to do. Another prep step was adding this little black box This, I believe not it wires in line with the original gets signal from the Doorbell Pro Those prep steps out of the way, it's time I do already know another part to make this work out Let's get this thing torn apart. ** 80s 'vibe' removal montage ** With my intercom removed, hanging out of the wall that I don't 100% That's something we'll talk about later. Then down here with the doorbell switch, that I actually need which is at an angle So I need to design a part to sit flush on here and get the doorbell Realistically, there are probably a bunch of different ways Making a mold a pattern off of it. Sketching onto a piece of paper But I know how I'm intending to approach to be specific. So I'm going to lay this flat, straight So it's sitting on the top of there. And then I'll use a pair of calipers, of that peak. In this case, we're looking right at 11mm step to the depth that. I'm looking at 113.28mm Now I need three numbers from a triangle to figure out the rest of the dimensions I can figure a right so that's what I'm going to use I don't even have to measure And as a former professional fabricator, Triangle Solver app on my phone I don't even have to remember to make this all work. With those measurements in hand. Realistically, I can just use the measurement in Fusion profile view of the siding, The part Now while the 3D print for I'm going to replace this switch for the front lights of the house because this is on the same circuit Since I have that breaker kicked off It's a perfect time to replace this switch. This Honeywell switch is fine, to set up automations and some other Wi-Fi I'm going to be running through. Home Assistant will give me. There are a lot of smart I decided to go with these TP-Link for this application This two pack was pretty affordable two light switches, and one for those stair lights The second reason is There are plenty of smart switches that could be really useful to have a lot But I want whoever walks up to this switch to turn on the light that they're trying to turn on or whatever I don't want them to have to know exactly in the middle of the night, in the dark, the final reason I went with They will work with Home Assistant. Now a lot of products from this brand only And their app just so happens some newer products which I can use with Home Assistant, and So these will work for me. Now I'm not an electrician, than swapping this out was as simple It is a toggle button, not a flip switch, That took a little bit but it's simple once you figure it out. While installing those light switches, our 3D Again I printed this in the Natural ASA using that SiC Nozzle from Phaetus I designed this pretty accurately, so it's matching to the siding Long term, I probably should seal around This is under an awning Our doorbell wires just hook up power to this. It is a Wi-Fi unit, with the rest of my network, So adopting it into the Unifi Protect The weak signal was momentary thing. There is one more Smart Home but I'm not going to do it It is this B-Hyve This house does have sprinklers and I've become quite the suburban dad More so than the lawn. This is a smart controller from my phone to cycle things, which will be really handy I can turn it off and on and not have to come back into the garage Also, it's going to allow for weather there's no reason to run this So this will allow that. The problem is that this is going to mount to that wall back there So it would be temporarily installed unwire it, that wall, That wall soon to. That wall soon to. It is now fall Northwest, so sprinklers aren't necessary There is one more key ingredient missing and that's a way for Home Assistant to communicate Some will auto-magically be detected when it's on the same network Home assistant is already telling me, They can both be connected to the setup. But I don't want everything I'm running to be on my Wi-Fi because it would start to bog down transmission if every light switch When I want to be sending files to a 3D printer As such, Smart home hardware has figured this out. There are different wireless protocols devices to use that aren't going to cause Common ones are Z-Wave, Matter run on and I have a few other items I know Not necessarily Zigbee close to the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi signal, but my Raspberry Pi doesn't natively So these aren't popping up in Home That's where these come in. It's a USB and this is a little Matter wired gateway. So this one will allow me to pick up And it's going to wire in I don't know if these are the best. I don't know if they're even great I just picked some that seemed like and I believe I checked to make sure Let's find out and get them set up. Installing the Matter It came with a CAT5e cable and a USB-C but no power adapter. I had to dig one out for it. I really wish this was POE powered, a Matter gateway that was POE power. If you know of one, I'm going to get this plugged in. I think I need to add RGB to my rack So sorry Installation of the ZOOZ Z-Wave stick, it's just an antenna on a USB stick, it's very easy. I can just plug it into this front USB But I'm actually going to plug it into one I'm hoping this doesn't act as a big If it does, I'll have to run an extension I'm prepared for that. I'm also prepared to have to do that Running a longer RJ 45 cable After installing my Z-Wave stick there was one piece of connectivity and I actually need The Compute Module 4 that any wireless connectivity, I'm running it over a hard wired Ethernet but I have a device When I posted to Twitter about this Assistant Twitter account They let me know that there's an improved but they also let me know to act as a Bluetooth dongle for my Home With the information they provided, ESP32 with ESP-Home So this is now connected but it can be the Bluetooth receiver so I can actually mount this Put it into a 3D printed case and as long as I got The reason I need that is in this utility In a previous video, in my HVAC system that I was looking for Well, Home the communication to that unit Jean: ** expert opinion in meow form ** so I need to mount up that ESP32 It's right next to the server rack, to get a good connection assistant setup so I can automate things And just as I thought I do have one more one more thing And that is a extremely important A button. This is an arre, I guess that's how you pronounce it, Brand smart button. This can be set up through the Matter to do anything you want effectively. It is a blank slate of a product exactly what functions I believe it also has multi-press. So you could do a different function And if you hold it for a long time, I'm only really worried about one press on and off functionality, As a light switch for these stair lights. That is, however, ** multiple switch clicks w/ nothing happening ** That switch isn't working right now I just pressed a button on my phone. The light switch that controls This button? Not so much. The reason why I don't have a way to connect I thought I had that worked out with that but that apparently I found some references online I need to go a different direction, and get a different USB So for right now, And realistically, that's the power If you buy everything from one company, But you may be limited by their product If you go a route like I am with Home different pieces to work together, that might not work for you, or things But when you get it working properly, it feels like there's I'm only dipping my toes in. I'm setting up that smart button so I don't have to wire a three way switch pulling wires down the steps just so I can get a light switch I have a wireless button that'll do it. That AC Infinity fan I've been running that off of temperature So what I'm going to set up is an automation that when my Ecobee or the air conditioner to turn So it'll be directly tied to the way the way it really should be. A couple of times throughout this video I mentioned these intercoms They aren't functional, but I'm wondering My primary thought has been to remove them, see and using that to supply power to a tablet to function so that each room that used to have can have its own control panel that lights in the room, But I also just don't know anything about these things, They might be AC voltage, they might have If so, I haven't found it anywhere. I don't know whether or not and I don't really have any other thoughts The one out front that I removed, I'm to print a small cover for now, and just paint the area And now, thanks to the power of 3D this house is a little bit smarter, Half of it doesn't work at this point, And thank you again If you want to pick up their new line of silicon carbide nozzles you can find links in the description to go check those out And that is where we're going to call it for Folks are smart home-ification I'm sure plenty of you have some excellent If you have any input on what I should do improve my studio and the house Let me know in the COMMENTS. That's gonna wrap it up for this one, folks. I hope you found this video interesting. Make sure to get SUBSCRIBED It's not a guarantee, but it can't hurt. See you in the next one!
