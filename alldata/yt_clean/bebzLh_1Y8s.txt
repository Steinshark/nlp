(text beeps) - [Narrator] Many game or sequels, and every so often, one of them comes along and kills off or severely damages an entire franchise. Here are 10 examples of that. Just a fair warning, this video Let's get started off with number ten and talk This is a now classic World I mean, it was like, kick-started by freaking Steven Spielberg. From the PlayStation the &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; games They were incredibly fun, cinematic first person shooter war games well before you had a solid or anything like that. &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; was crushing it with a score by Michael Giacchino who is now famous for doing Two really incredible, of stuff you'd see in war movies like &quot;Storming the Beaches of Normandy.&quot; Yeah, &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; did in video game form. From the Pacific Theater to Nazi intrigue, all kinds of stuff, they really had it going on for a while. And then it seems like when &quot;Call of Duty&quot; and to pop off, &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; But around 2010, it's when EA really tried to revitalize things, into the modern age, so to speak, with 2010's &quot;Medal of Honor,&quot; and then 2012's &quot;Medal And the problem with these games is that they were half-assed and Now, they had their moments, mind you. &quot;Medal of Honor Warfighter,&quot; which I do remember not for &quot;Gameranx,&quot; but somewhere, actually had some surprisingly But otherwise, these modern were like, totally all On the surface, they looked pretty good, but once you actually got to playing one, there were so many other games at the time, and they totally 2012 had &quot;Medal of Honor and quickly be forgotten, and we haven't heard anything about &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; since. Then, I mean, to be fair, in 2010, there was &quot;Medal of the Oculus VR game by but that didn't necessarily take off. And after that, and considering this was a we don't know if the is ever really gonna see a resurgence. I mean, nothing is ever really dead. They could bring it back and drag it out in a couple more years and &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; is definitely Next, over at number nine, Oh man, do you remember this one? Leading up to it, it seemed like it was All those cool new weapons, the game's cover art, like, People were obviously because the last two &quot;Ninja They were incredibly I mean, we still talk about &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; and &quot;Ninja Gaiden Black&quot; all the time here if you watch &quot;Gameranx&quot; every day. Man, the lead up to &quot;Ninja And then when this thing dropped in 2012, it got a lot of bad reviews. I famously remember a really crushing one from Giant Bomb where they gave it like, a two out of five stars. Overall, nobody was really happy with it. I remember personally after, it just felt like regular And along with that, the game just lost a lot of its identity. It felt really hand-holdy. A lot of people had built it as just kind of button-mashy and stupid. The game had your typical which were popular at the time, and just something was really missing. The soul of &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; And again, it's just so jarring because these first two &quot;Ninja Those were solid video with challenge, secrets, nuance, and &quot;Ninja Gaiden 3&quot; just kind a cheap knockoff. Now, they then tried fixing it with the &quot;Razor's Edge&quot; re-release, but for most people, it was Oh, and then after that, I mean, are we even gonna get into this? They put out &quot;Ninja Gaiden Yaiba,&quot; and 'cause like, that was even worse. Technically that wasn't like, but still, it definitely Really, &quot;Ninja Gaiden 3&quot; was where a lot of things seemingly died. I still think the original two games, and I mean, the classic are still good enough that eventually we might But as of right now, &quot;Ninja and it pains me to say that. Like, it just doesn't feel right. Next, over at number eight, we have &quot;Command and Conquer 4,&quot; which if you ask certain people, they say it was kind of the I mean, &quot;Command and Conquer&quot; They roll it out for certain things, but &quot;Command and Conquer 4&quot; and it wasn't that great. They really kind of changed up the whole resource gathering thing in favor of more like, managing and capturing and it just didn't feel the same, and it seems like it That being said, it's an okay game. If you look at reviews, you know, it's got a lot Not a total complete disaster but I feel like there's a lot we can dive into with just like, the main how the &quot;Red Alert&quot; Like, there's a lot of nuances here, but ultimately, the bottom line is that 4 was just 4, and the RTS genre started at least with mainstream popularity. They're still out there. People really play them and love them, but they don't quite pop off in terms of mainstream And I think EA unfortunately realized that they're always the and in this case, they kind of bailed on Next, over at number seven, we have &quot;Castlevania: Lords of Shadows 2.&quot; Now, this released in 2014, and it's actually technically like, the last new entry in the And that sucks because they were kind of onto something with the original. I mean, depending on who you ask. It definitely took a lot of stuff and threw it to the wayside from classic &quot;Castlevania&quot; games. But it was a cool refresh. It was very of the time, kind of a &quot;God of War&quot; style and the Belmonts, and all but &quot;Castlevania: Lord of Shadows 2&quot; kind of took it even further with you playing as Dracula And that was something that ended up being a cool twist in the first game. And then in the second It kind of jumped the shark a little bit. There's parts where and it just very much of the time, a 2014 game, you know, cheesy cutscenes, over the top characters, quick time events. I personally like that stuff, but not always for &quot;Castlevania.&quot; And while it was cute it was not as good for the second one. It didn't review as And ultimately, I think that Konami was just and really were kind of that was it. &quot;Castlevania&quot; I don't I think we're gonna see more of it soon. I really hope so. I really think it's time for this thing to return full speed ahead, but I guess we're just Next, over at number six, Now, let's roll the The original &quot;Dead It was just so cool and on an almost like, George with a good Capcom Japanese spin to it. It was creative, it was and it was also technically For a lot of people, if you ask some of us, that and the series never really quite reached the same height since. It was all downhill. Now, the second one kind added some things, and it was all right, but then by three, the game So 2016's &quot;Dead Rising 4&quot; like the comeback kid. You were once again playing as Frank, the beloved classic character, and it had kind of a shopping like, you weren't just in a shopping mall. There was a lot more to it, but still, seems like it was to the first one and be a good time. Unfortunately though, the game was not received Now, full disclosure, I played it. I thought it was all right. I didn't think it was but I certainly didn't But for most people, they were checked out of the series at this point, I think that ultimately the bottom line is that they just kept watering down what &quot;Dead Rising&quot; was from game to game. And by four, it had really dried up. I mean, it was another open-worldish game in a sea of them when a lot of other games were kicking ass that year. I mean, 2016 was the year that like, &quot;Hitman&quot; started to kind of &quot;Doom&quot; was blowing people away, so &quot;Dead Rising&quot; just kind of Ultimately, it seemingly and that's really all we've heard about &quot;Dead Rising&quot; since. That was 2016. We're pretty far out from that. I expect good old Frank West at some point, but not a new Next, over at number Now, let's roll it back again. The original &quot;Fear&quot; was It was an incredibly tense, technically impressive with compelling enemies, some challenge, and also just it was surprisingly scary. It had some really, Things kind of continued with the developer, publisher had and &quot;Fear 3&quot; released in 2011, and really, it was a If you compare &quot;Fear 3&quot; to the first game, it's like being on a different planet. &quot;Fear 3&quot; just was very much of the time, a very 2011-ass game with corny cutscenes, weird, cheesy characters, shoehorned co-op elements that, yeah, you can say that some of those elements were actually kind of creative, but still, it wasn't And bottom line, it wasn't scary at all. I don't really know with this game to just go so and after being like, &quot;Oh, You just totally flipped Okay. It wasn't like, a It felt totally half-assed. And interestingly enough, the game actually has okay reviews. If you look at the Metacritic, I mean like, the review scores are okay, and the user scores, the actual People were really burned by this one, and I don't know if we're That was just like, a Man, that original &quot;Fear&quot; Now, down to number four, don't I take this one extremely personally. It's &quot;Sim City,&quot; the 2013 game just was kind of like, the with the problems with modern games, and specifically a lot of The lead up to &quot;Sim City 2013&quot; felt big. The screenshots, the videos, everything coming out, the and incredible, and it seemed like Maxus and EA were really going for it. It was seemingly going to be more dynamic, more detailed with more just a kind of different gameplay And like, critically, at face value, some critics thought it was once it actually released the game hit a lot of problems. It was technically an absolute mess. It was buggy, it was messy, And it also was one of the earlier games that and it was a game that by yourself, but EA wanted you to be And the problem was when there were a bunch of network outages, so it was just kind of like, There was tons of crashing. You'd be sitting around to load to connect to EA's servers. People were actually losing their saves, and it was just like, a disastrous launch. If you think modern game &quot;Sim City 2013&quot; really This was like an early They wanted you online, and they wanted to keep and keep you playing &quot;Sim City&quot; forever. And you know what, that's Technically it was way too early for this type of content delivery, and ultimately, other developers I mean, the &quot;City Skyline&quot; games and all their expansions are great. They have a great player people that buy into these &quot;Sim City 2013&quot; wasn't, what happened after this one? Technically a section of Maxus closed down in 2015, and that was And &quot;Sim City&quot; now at this to mobile game whateverness. Whateverness, I don't know. Whateverness is Sim City Next, over at number three, Yeah, the 2022 reboot We reviewed it, we put out and we were not fans. It was technically an absolute mess, but also, it lost so much of the humor and charm that Say what you will about them. Some people love them, some people like the early ones, some people like the later ones. But &quot;Saints Row 3&quot; tried to and ultimately, made none of them happy. The game was absolutely, devoid of charm. It had a cool city, but the stuff you did It was glitchy and all the with were shockingly annoying. The game very quickly publicly of the holding company, Embracer Group. And after that, Volition, the developers who had since the beginning, got absorbed into parts of Gearbox Entertainment. And it's worth pointing at a point had like a 60 a two and a half on user score. And credit to developers, they actually supported it post-launch. They put out a little bit of stuff, but ultimately, nobody cared. It's such a shame because like I said, whether you like the early ones, whether you like the later ones when they went totally crazy, the &quot;Saints Row&quot; games were special. They were cool for a lot of people for a variety of different reasons. And &quot;Saints Row 2022&quot; seemingly by most people. Hey, if you had fun with it, that's you. We're not gonna judge you. But it doesn't seem like anytime soon. And they were good developers for a very long time, and it's a shame. (bullets popping) - [Driver] Knockin' 'em down. (driver grunts) (motorcycle thuds) - [Passenger] Reload! Reload! (bullets popping) (cyclist screams) - [Driver] Okay. Back in the saddle. From here on out, observe and report. - [Narrator] Now, coming &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite.&quot; Yeah, that was the last one. When was the last time you thought about &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom?&quot; When was the last time you thought about &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite?&quot; Well, the sixth mainline which was released in 2017, just pissed off a lot of players, and there was just a lot about it, I mean, specifically with a lot of games in this video, a lot of the core elements of &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; Stuff was taken away, and ultimately, the game was Now, as someone who's not an I found it kind of just cool to pick up and play and punch some people. But the hardcore fighting these games live and die by those people. And if they're not happy, And that was the case with Not to mention all the with this, like, certain microtransaction stuff, I believe a really crappy that a lot of people There's a lot to this but ultimately, the game and that's how these go. Are we gonna see another &quot;Marvel I don't know. It seems like Marvel with some cool video but it has certainly been a while. &quot;Marvel versus Capcom&quot; has Now, down to number or as I like to call it, &quot;Driv3r.&quot; Yes, this was the time where in the titles of the games and movies. This was very normal at the time if I'm being totally honest. But still, &quot;Driver 3&quot; followed The original game was completely unique for the original PlayStation, oh, introduced some like, open-world, get out of your car type elements, and they really felt like But after that, the rise and &quot;Driver 3&quot; really was kind of chasing at that game's heels. There was a time when we had like, &quot;Grand Theft Auto Vice City,&quot; but then also 2004's &quot;Driv3r,&quot; and I mean, if you compare the two, yikes. I mean, where &quot;Driver&quot; is and like, a little bit more gritty with some cool car mechanics and physics and stuff like I mean, the shooting third person, at any time you were on foot The game was a technical mess, and a lot of people didn't really care, and &quot;Grant Theft Auto&quot; (intense music) (bullets popping) (cutouts creak) (bullets popping) (cutouts creak) (bullets popping) As a longtime fan of the &quot;Driver&quot; series, since the original game, I forced myself to really like &quot;Driver 3.&quot; I still think there are some but ultimately, it didn't do enough to really blow away mainstream audiences. And it was a technical mess. Like, if you go back and play it now, it's Now, to be fair, the &quot;Driver&quot; series did continue after this. We had the great &quot;Driver&quot; in the 70s. We had the really underrated but nothing really reached the height of those original &quot;Driver&quot; games. And &quot;Driver 3&quot; kind of kicked very slow years long decline to the point where now we're from &quot;Driver&quot; ever again. Again, I wanna point out, &quot;Driver San Francisco&quot; is very cool. It is totally different, but it's a unique driving game that you should still and you should especially check it out because it might be So those are some games that killed whole video game franchises, at least in some way, shape, or form.
