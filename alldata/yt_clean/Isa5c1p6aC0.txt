I'm hoping Hello, Dr. Gravel. -[ Charlsie ] Charlsie. -[ Charlsie ] Thank you. He is a population geneticist in Montreal. Last time you saw your DNA, tube like this. I spit in quite a That's right. So, once you send those they'll take your saliva. They clean it up. They will break down the cells and then clean the DNA, And then they lay it out on -[ Charlsie ] So, if we look at chip tell me that definitively I am from wherever? No. There are a lot of steps A lot of statistical and, you know, whose is being compared to. -[ Charlsie ] Here's Our entire DNA is made Ancestry companies, though, About 700,000 sections where differences or Then, they compare the patterns of people in their databases. And with the help of math, they you most likely belong to. It's not a hundred So statistics tell what's the best situation? It is a statistical guess. -[ Charlsie ] Yeah. But it is never a hundred -[ Charlsie ] Sure. Growing up, we were German. -[ Charlsie ] Not a sure thing? That sure isn't The big surprise was 52% of my DNA comes So, I traded in my -[ Charlsie ] So you were This one drives me nuts. You know, and I see Whether you want to wear is not tied to your DNA. -[ Charlsie ] Okay. Timothy Caulfield is who studies the It's an exciting story, right? It's about you, right?. I get why they're doing it. But is it really Can they really I think they're selling supported by the science. With 23andme.com you can find from 31 populations -[ Charlsie ] What do you that are being I think it's misleading. These companies are really this is scientific, right? They are using They present it in a way that -[ Charlsie ] Caulfield says is entertainment. I think it's They can have a little Don't take it too seriously. Know that you are just getting approximation of how your It's not tracing -[ Charlsie ] Back in Specific percentages like, definitive like here's from this place. That's not that. The only one we can kind are the continental level. -[ Charlsie ] Hmm. The most certain thing they you're from? And get this, over at the company admits some of We highlight the sources of to be present using our best The deeper I go, the And at 23andMe their until we stumble upon this. Select confidence level. What? Why does it say 50%? Does that mean you're only 50% Yeah. -[ Charlsie ] Is Yeah, or at least 50%. That seems shocking. Only half sure. Yeah. -[ Charlsie ] Do you think that No, no. I would like it if they more clearly. -[ Charlsie ] That's right. 50% confidence is Check out what happens the most confident setting. 23andMe says we're mostly I would not take this kind of thing. -[ Charlsie ] Forget all my the Balkan in me. Exactly, right? [ ] -[ Charlsie ] This is [ ] -[ Charlsie ] DNA ancestry these things? I've seen a lot of deals around Half off. -[ Charlsie ] I'm out on the know about DNA ancestry kits I got it for my mom for fun of her Irish heritage. Cheers. Don't touch it though. -[ Charlsie ] My twin and ancestry kits. Oh! -[ Charlsie ] And getting What?! I think they're selling supported by the science. -[ Charlsie ] So you would pretty accurate? Is it not? I think they must be pretty be, like, getting all I'm assuming, at least. I think they're true. I mean, I would trust them. We're engineering students. We think science, Personally I would think -[ Charlsie ] I took five tests. So did my sister. What would you The same, identical. They should be the same. Identical. -[ Charlsie ] Should Should be identical. -[ Charlsie ] Now, it's time A little chubby. That's me. -[ Charlsie ] Yeah, Ready? 1-2-3. -[ Charlsie ] At 23andMe Mine says 98.1% European We're pretty close. -[ Charlsie ] Italian, 37.7. Ooh, 36.8. But then we begin growing apart. Only 28% Eastern I'm only 24% Eastern This one actually -[ Charlsie ] Mine doesn't. Mine does. -[ Charlsie ] What? Look. Poland, possible match. -[ Charlsie ] Poland was It specifically And it gets weirder. Okay, this is hilarious, French and German. What? Oh, I don't have that. -[ Charlsie ] You No. -[ Charlsie ] We are But you would have to wonder I'm 3.8% broadly European. I'm 12.7. -[ Charlsie ] Wow, Yeah. [ ] -[ Charlsie ] How In search of answers, to Yale University and meet international team of They study DNA and statistics. And they are stunned I have to say, that I mean, we expected two exact same ancestry The fact that they present your sister I find We thought for sure that the person spit, there was a -[ Charlsie ] But then and you're saying you checked. -[ Charlsie ] And No difference. It's scarily the same. -[ Charlsie ] The Yale team DNA sections from The agreement between 99.7% agreement. -[ Charlsie ] 23andMe's statistically identical. It's the same for Why would Car be more I would if our DNA is the same? She's not. You and your twin sister ancestry, end of day. There's nothing to say. I mean, that's the truth. -[ Charlsie ] How can This must be purely in terms does on the data. [ ] -[ Charlsie ] 23andMe with funny twin differences. Oh, great. Now you're Scottish and Irish. Alright, I'll give you that. -[ Charlsie ] Living DNA stumpers too. Yours says south Italy. Mine says Tuscany. I just don't understand how you and I don't? -[ Charlsie ] I don't know. You have to come from You cannot come from It just doesn't work from that. I mean in this one, your But you come from Scotland -[ Charlsie ] But not everybody [ ] MyHeritage, the company that ancestry gives us the So one of the good things it's very consistent. -[ Charlsie ] Okay, And Ancestry DNA and Family Tree So, if the DNA technology why are some companies giving us We spent many hours trying be different, but we cannot. I think that the clean thing they did the calculations but and your sister should get the -[ Charlsie ] When we asked about our twin results, they in our DNA can lead their estimates because, remember, the same DNA science, and different people in which population And whatever your results... 11% Scandinavia, -[ Charlsie ] ..don't get may change. There's been some changes. There's been I was 11% Scandinavian Where did that 11% go? -[ Charlsie ] It and me too with ancestry DNA. Look, look, look, This was my first result, but the database and Check out the differences. I think that's nuts -[ Charlsie ] The health policy I was once 100% Irish. I do love Guinness an awful lot. But now apparently -[ Charlsie ] Your results don't Often they change as their databases. The commercials What do you think of that? They don't mention that, right? It actually does evolve It shows how imprecise it is the science actually works. -[ Charlsie ] People hear DNA CSI, Law &amp; Order, jail or getting out of You're exactly right. And they're leveraging that that comes from the genuine excitement in pop culture of legitimacy. And I think that's Charlsie: This is -[ Charlsie ] My twin and I tests aren't really Now, I'm more confused now And I have more questions I am, where I'm from, Look, I don't If people find this fun, okay. But do not put too -[ Charlsie ] Yet, the industry slick marketing, and You can connect more deeply [ ] -[ Charlsie ] The five say they use rigorous science. They also acknowledge are statistical estimates. Family Tree DNA says figuring because it's kind of MyHeritage says its the results are estimates. I'm going to show Out on the street, do Now that you have seen the of the promises, what do you getting, what they can tell you? There's no-- not a shred showing you is accurate. -[ Charlsie ] It's an estimate. Really? It's not accurate? -[ Charlsie ] Estimate. That's what experts tell us. Are you surprised? Yes, I kind of wanted to do it. I would like to assume behind there when they More science behind it. -[ Charlsie ] You think there's I'd like to believe, yes. I don't know. I'm kind of sad right now. Make a statement on Those ads where they have bottom of the screen, just write vary depending on I would like to see the scientifically accurate, right? If you could recreate what should the messaging be? What should they look like? Well, you know, I don't I think my ads would Push the idea this is You know, let's see how your people's DNA. This isn't going to be but it's going to be fun. -[ Charlsie ] Caulfield says some of the marketing Yes, there are biological But there aren't these That's a dangerous message if where we're worried about They're saying that there That's scientifically wrong problematic. -[ Charlsie ] And here's some We humans share more We're a lot more alike [ ] -[ Charlsie ] Have What did you think Take our Marketplace [ ]
