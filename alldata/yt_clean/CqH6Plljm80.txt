Here's the money as promised. Take it. Consider this a loan from you. I'll pay it back to Mr. Green later. Never thought I'd marry a stranger on my first day in the city. But with Frank's medical bills, I had no choice. Remember, you're just Mr. Green's wife on paper. You'll get the divorce once the agreement ends. Sir, everything's arranged. Drive me to see my mother at the hospital. Yes, sir. Mom, I'm in the city now. Frank's check-up went fine. Take care of yourself. Alas. . . Nicole, don't push yourself too hard. Let me know if you need anything. Oh, poor dear. Mom, what's wrong? Oh, well, young master's here. I'll hang up now. Huh? Ma'am, young master's here. Oh my! Oh my! All done. Hahahaha! You little rascal, you're finally married. Well, well, which lucky lady became the richest man's wife? Hahaha! Alright, Mom. I'm leaving for a business trip. You just got back! Frank, I've paid for your surgery. You'll get better soon. Nicole, where did you get so much money? I. . . I borrowed it from a friend. Just focus on getting better. I'll work hard to pay it back. Nicole, once I recover, I'll help you earn money to repay the debt. Be good. I need to go to work now. Call me if you need anything. Hey! You! Come here. Mr. Wade. Nicole, you just started here recently, right? Yes. Your probation failed. Don't come here tomorrow. Why, Mr. Wade? Did I do something wrong? Who told you to eat lunch in the hotel lobby? The janitor's room had a water leak. Repairs are underway. I didn't want to make a mess elsewhere, so I found a random corner. That's normal where I'm from. A country bumpkin, figures. This is a five-star hotel under Green Group. Ever heard of it? We're top three globally. Our guests here are all VIPs. Even our cleaners need urban registration and top university degrees. A country bumpkin like you will only embarrass us. Get out! Don't dirty our floors. What's wrong with being from the countryside? I can improve if I made mistakes, but you can't discriminate against me just because I'm from the countryside. You damn girl, how dare you talk back to me! You hire based on background, not ability? Haven't you heard talent comes from everywhere? If you can't understand that, I don't think Green Group will last long. Security, get her out of here! Let me go! I can walk myself! Stop! Release her. Mr. Green, you're back! Mr. Wade. Yes. Since when do we hire based on background rather than ability? Um. . . Mr. Green, I was just trying to maintain our image. I did it all for the company. If I remember correctly, weren't you also born in the countryside before getting urban registration? Yes. Then shouldn't you resign? Mr. Green, I'm sorry! I was wrong! I told you I want to improve our service quality. Is this how you do it? No, Mr. Green. Nicole sold herself to marry an old man for money. I was just worried about our reputation. So I. . . Stop lying! I did no such thing! Do you have proof? I. . . heard some rumors. Rumors? I advice you to start over as a room cleaner tomorrow. Report to Rooms Division. You better learn what service quality means. What? What are you waiting for? Get to work. Yes, sir. You're Nicole, right? Yes. Starting tomorrow, you'll be paid fifteen hundred dollars a month, plus weekends off, and full benefits. Stay if you want, or take compensation to leave. Sure, I'll stay! Mr. Green, right? Thank you. You're the most reasonable boss I've ever met. Sorry. Watch out! Have we met somewhere before? I used to deliver takeout. Maybe we met then? Mr. Green never orders takeout. I think we just. . . Hello? Yes, understood. Mr. Green. Yes? Your mother insists on seeing you. Wanda. Yes? Help me check my makeup. Oops, too pale. Really? But that's how they do it in short videos. Oh, Herman, you're finally back! I don't have much time left. My only wish is to meet my daughter-in-law! Ma'am, it's me. Well. . . Mr. Green asked me to tell you he knows you faked being sick to trick him into marriage. He won't hold it against you but hopes you'll stop meddling in his marriage. I won't bother you anymore then. Wait! Wait! Mr. Green, is it really okay to lie to your mother when you're not divorced yet? I can get divorced now. Wait! This is Mr. Green's presidential suite. You're not qualified! New staff only clean regular rooms. Do you know that? And. . . Oh sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Wade. I'll be more careful next time. Room thirty-seven needs checkout. Go there. Just a cleaner. You think I can't handle you? Hmph! Room thirty-seven has our most difficult VIP. Hello, housekeeping. Come in. Hello, are you checking out? What took you so long? I've been waiting forever. Sorry, I need to check the room first. Check what? What could I take from this lousy hotel? I'm your VIP guest. Sorry, but it's our standard procedure. I'm in a hurry. Move! Wait! Madam! Madam! Madam, please wait! What now? Is this yours? Yes, it is. Well, could you tell me what's inside? What do you mean? Are you suspecting me? Sorry. I'm just following protocol. Fifteen hundred dollars in sequential bills. That's right. Here you go. Wait! You touched the money. How do I know you didn't take some? Let me count it first. She definitely took some. That's what cleaners do. Everything okay? Not okay! A hundred and fifty is missing! That's impossible. I didn't touch the money. I've seen your type before. Acting nice but stealing behind our backs. You're not leaving until I get my money back! Looks like we have a problem here. Mr. Green! Since you're questioning my staff, let's check it out. Will, please count for this madam. Fifteen hundred exactly. Nothing is missing. I must have miscounted. While we prioritize customer service and put customers first, our staff deserve respect. They're not here to be bullied. Spread my word. From now on, blacklist this guest from all Green Group properties. She will never be served again. I spend millions here every year as a VIP! You can't treat me like this! Show her out. This way, VIP madam. Hmph! Thank you, Mr. Green. I heard everything. Well done. You're promoted to Logistics Supervisor. Set an example for the department. What? Mr. Green, she's only been here a month. This is. . . Her ability and character aren't measured by time served. Yes, sir. Mr. Green, this isn't appropriate. You don't want it? I. . . Mr. Green, better take this call. I'm afraid Ma'am might cause trouble otherwise. Alright. That's settled. Back to work. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Green. Hello, Mom. You brat! That's how you pay me back for raising you up? How dare you hang up on me! I know you haven't divorced yet. Don't forget, I still have your marriage certificate. What do you want on earth? Let me tell you, if you don't bring my daughter-in-law to see me today, I. . . I'll go on hunger strike! You won't have a mother anymore! Fine, I'll arrange it. Hello? I need a favor. Meet my mom later. I'll send you the address. Remember, mess it up so we can get divorce. Don't let her like you. Okay. Mr. Green, Ma'am wants you to be there too. It's been so long. . . Why don't you come along? Sorry, I've said too much. Fine, I'll go. Remember, mess it up so we can divorce. Don't let her like you. Right, I can't dress normally. If his mom likes me, we can't divorce. Got it. She'll hate this look. Though my daughter-in-law isn't a beauty, as long as she's a good homemaker. No, Mom. She's not the kind of woman who keeps a good house. She's a gold-digger and a snob. She only married me for money. Hush! I have eyes. Mind your own business. Stop blocking me from meeting her. Now get out! Finally I'll see my daughter-in-law! Mrs. Green. So you're Nicole, my daughter-in-law? Yes, that's me. No, you look so different! Sorry, this is how I usually dress. Your son said you like modest girls, that's why I looked different in the marriage photo. This is outrageous! Your son begged to marry me. Now he wants stability while I want excitement. We're incompatible and getting divorced. That's all I wanted to say. I'll leave now. Hey, hey! Wait! What I mean is, you're married to my son. Don't call me Mrs. Green, call me Mom. Huh? I never expected such a beautiful and stylish girl is my daughter-in-law! My son really got lucky. You're so young. Enjoy life a bit! Hahaha! This isn't right. He wanted me to mess things up. But. . . Mrs. Green, let me be honest with you. I'm just a cleaner from the countryside with little education. And I married your son just for money. But. . . you don't look like it? These clothes are rented to fool you. My brother is sick. Mrs. Green, his treatment costs a lot. Your son and I aren't right for each other. Oh Nicole, you poor girl! That stupid brat didn't tell me anything! Nicole, don't worry. I'm not the kind of mother-in-law who would break you up. It doesn't matter if you're poor. Once you're in our family, I'll make sure Herman treats you well. Nothing works, true or false! Mrs. Green, we're really not compatible. I don't like him. I see. My son likes you! It's unrequited love, right? It's like a secret crush, isn't it? It's like that he paid a lot of money to keep you close. And he really loves you but mistreats you. And you endure it all for your family and money. Trust me, dear. I've seen so many dramas like this. I totally understand. But Herman's not bad though. He's alright. Why not give it another try? Huh? No, this isn't working. Wait, city folks hate bride prices. Okay, Mrs. Green, I'll tell you the truth. There's a tradition in our village. Marriage requires a big bride price. No money, no marriage. How much do you want? I have money. Name it. Three thousand dollars should be enough to scare her off. Three million? No problem. I'll give you double. So, just have a baby for me to play with, okay? What? But you just married Herman for a year, and he's been abroad. No rush for having a baby. What's your account number? I'll transfer the money now. No, Mrs. Green, I was joking. No way! No jokes about this. Payment received, three million. Money's sent. Now call me Mom. Mrs. Green, I can't. . . I can't accept this. Call me Mom. Three million for one word isn't too much, is it? Now, I'll have Herman pick us up. Let me think about it, which house should we live in? Hey, how did it go? How did what go? You little rascal, stop acting tough! You almost lost your wife! Luckily I had money. Three million dollars to keep my precious daughter-in-law. I order you to come pick us up now! Hello? Hello! Mr. Green, what did Ma'am do this time? She paid three million to stop that woman from divorcing me. What? What should we do now? Turn around to the cafe. I need to meet my good wife and find out what she told my mother. Yes. Mrs. Green, I gotta get going. Still calling me Mrs. Green? Maybe I didn't offer you enough. I'll transfer you another three million now. No need, no need. Mom. What did you call me? Say it again. Mom. Oh, my dear! Mom, I've got stuff to do. I really need to go. No hurry. Herman's coming to drive you there. Mom, where is that woman? Watch your tone! She's your wife. She's left. Left? Where to? Hahaha! Herman, why didn't you tell me about it? I never expected my daughter-in-law to be such a kind, independent, beautiful, and thoughtful girl. She is absolutely perfect! Hahaha! What? I remember her being plain and ordinary. Is it just my memory that's off? But her life's been hard. Herman, I order you to go dating her, buy her earrings, diamond rings and gem necklaces. Anyway, just make up for this past year! Mom. Hmm. Mr. Green, why do I feel Ma'am seems like she's been conned? What did this woman do to my mom? Go now! Mr. Green, are you really going to meet her? No. Despite yesterday's chaos, that woman returned the money. She seems reasonable. Maybe meet her once? You want me to accept her as my wife? No, I just think you should meet her. After all, you two should talk properly about the divorce. Send me your date photos, or I'll give your company to my daughter-in-law! Mr. Green. Let's go. That's hundred, thousand. . . A hundred thousand? Why did Mr. Green bring me here? Let me see this one please. Mr. Green, I'm married. This isn't appropriate. You're married? Never heard you mention it. Don't get me wrong. I just want you to help me pick some gifts for my wife. I'll buy her something for Mom's sake, but no meeting. Oh, I see. You scared me for a moment. But Mr. Green, wouldn't a secretary be better for this? They're busy elsewhere. Never expect that Mr. Green seems cold, but he's actually a caring husband. Herman and Nicole are perfect together. Well, for my future grandchildren, I must try harder. Hello. Herman, how's your date with her? Oh, we haven't met yet. That boy gets shy somehow, shopping with his wife but won't admit it! Herman, you promised me to treat her well and spend money on her. We own the whole mall. Don't be stingy! I know. Which ones would you like? What do you think looks good? Well, they all look pretty good. Fine, I'll take them all. Mr. Green really spoils his wife. Mr. Green, I'll wait at the entrance. Go ahead. Why did they separate? Did they fight? This foolish brat doesn't know how to coax his wife. I remember he bought a fifteen-million necklace at auction. I must have it delivered to Nicole. Stupid boy! This dress is beautiful. Beautiful? That's thirty thousand. Not for poor people like you. I'm just looking around. You're blocking our business standing here. Look at your cheap clothes, obviously from the countryside. Your faded clothes will scare our customers away. Get lost! Who says she'll scare customers away? I just touched her gently. Don't blame it on me. Weren't you supposed to wait at the entrance? I just wandered over here. Get that dress down. Go on. Just so you know, if you damage it, you have to buy it. Go try it on. Mr. Green, this doesn't suit me. I think it looks good. Wow! You look beautiful in that dress! Oh, your husband is so lucky to marry you. No, no, I'm not his wife. Boyfriend then? We've all experienced. We understand. Mr. Green, I'm just a cleaner. This isn't appropriate. Remember what you said? Talent comes from everywhere. All people are equal. Who says cleaners can't wear dresses like this? Besides, cleaning is your job, not your whole life. You deserve all the wonderful things in life. Mr. Green, I'm just your employee. Why help me so much? My people aren't for others to bully. You just tried on one dress, stop acting all high and mighty. Mr. Green, forget it. It doesn't match my other clothes. Then we'll buy whatever else you need. Pack all of these up. What? Yes, sir. What fools. Now my commission will be huge. Sir, anything else I can help with? Haven't you received your walking papers? What? Seems your efficiency is indeed a problem. Ms. Maria, he said I'm fired! That's right. Listen up, you're fired. No way! He's just a country girl's boyfriend. He can't do that! What nonsense are you spouting? Open your eyes! He's Mr. Green, CEO of Green Group, our mall's owner. What? Mr. Green, these are too expensive. I can't accept them. The company party is coming up. These are your work uniform from me. The company will cover it. Oh, I see. Thank you, Mr. Green. I'll head back to work then. The hotel. . . Oh! Mr. Green is actually quite handsome looking this way. What am I thinking? He's married. He has a wife. Sorry, Mr. Green. I didn't mean to. If there is nothing else, I should go now. This stupid boy! I gave you the perfect chance. No kiss or hug. What's with this cold CEO act? I'll teach you a lesson today. Hello? What? Got tickets to my idol's concert? Hahaha, that's great! Forget it. How can Herman compare to my idol? Off to the overseas concert! I'll take Wanda too. Make it a trip! Haha! Here's our egg pancake. That'll be a buck. Nicole, you're having it rough, working right after leaving the hospital. What about that husband of yours? Ask him for help. He helped me once when we married. I can't trouble him again. Alas. . . You work at Green Group now, right? Why not ask your boss? Yvonne, don't worry. I can handle it. But that's nearly half a million dollars in medical bills! How will you handle it? What do you plan to do? Working day and night? Nicole, listen to me. Talk to your mom about your brother, okay? My mom's working as a housekeeper, barely making anything. And she has to mind her employer's mood. I don't want her to worry. Are you trying to make me angry? Do you think I'm too nice to you? How can you embarrass me on our overseas trip? I'm too old for these clothes, Ma'am. I don't care! You're coming with me and you'll dress beautifully! Haha! Here's a little something. Just take it. Don't refuse or I won't consider you my friend anymore. Thanks, Yvonne. Hmm. Hey, everyone look! Isn't this pancake seller Nicole from our village? Isn't this pancake seller Nicole from our village? Catherine? Am I right? Nicole, you're in Ocean City too? We're having a gathering today. Join us! You go ahead. I'll pass. I mean, our hometown group is all successful people. She's in such a state now. How could she come? Nicole, we know your father died early and your brother's sick. But even if you need money, selling on the street? It's embarrassing to have a street vendor as our fellow villager. You're from the same village. Why look down on her? If I embarrass you, just pretend you don't know me. Hey, why get upset over a few words? We're trying to help. I'm telling you, I'm a manager at Green Group now. Penny works with them too. We're all kind of a big deal now. If you need help, just let us know. We can donate to help you through. No need. Come on. Don't think it's too small. It's a small token of us. Here's a hundred. Fifty bucks from me! I'll give you thirty. That's too little. I'll give you two hundred. Haha! So rich. Haha! It's the first time that I see forced donations. Mr. Green? Mr. Green, what brings you here? I just passed by. Nicole, this guy is really handsome. Is he your husband? No way. It's all over the village that Nicole sold herself to an old man for money. You! He's not my husband. He's my boss, Mr. Green from Green Group. What? The world's richest man, that Mr. Green? Gary, aren't you a Green Group executive? Could he really be. . . Him? Impossible! Use your brain. How could Nicole know Mr. Green? I'll kneel for him if he's really Mr. Green. Really? I've never seen you at Green Group. Nicole, do all your friends pretend like you do? It has nothing to do with him. If you have issues, take them up with me. Sorry, Mr. Green. No need. They should apologize. You said you work for Green Group? Yes. Ten seconds to get over here. Yo, still pretending? Ten. . . Nine. . . Gary, apologize if you want to keep your job. Seven. . . I'll never apologize to him! Three. . . Two. . . One. Nothing happened after ten seconds. Huh? Oh, Will! What brings you here? Will, you showed up at just the right time. Someone's impersonating Mr. Green. What? Who? Who dares impersonate Mr. Green? I'm the one he means. What should we do? Will, let me handle this. I'll teach him what happens when he disrespect Mr. Green. Will, what are you doing? You're just a branch manager. You're fired for offending Mr. Green! What? He's really Mr. Green? Everyone here who has business ties to Green Group, will get the partnerships terminated. No one can bully my people. Nicole actually works at Green Group? That's impossible! I can't believe it. She's the Logistics Supervisor at our hotel. Nicole, we're from the same village. You wouldn't do this to me, right? You brought this on yourself. Heaven may forgive your sins, but not self-inflicted ones. Nicole, don't get cocky! So what if you work at Green Group? You still married some poor old bachelor. Mr. Green, aren't you embarrassed hiring someone like her? Nonsense! Nicole's husband is a big CEO, way better than you all! Stop it. He's been married to you this long yet lets people bully you? I'm calling him right now to settle this. Give me your phone. Wait! Why is your phone ringing? You're Nicole's husband? Oh! No, no! Sorry, Mr. Green. Just a misunderstanding. It's fine. I hired Nicole purely for her abilities. Her personal life is irrelevant. Will, make sure they all leave. Yes. Leave now! Mr. Green, thanks for helping. Here's a homemade egg pancake. It's clean. Ms. Stuart, this is your stall? Yes. Ms. Stuart, outside work isn't allowed in our company. You've broken the rules. Nicole's working so hard to pay her brother's medical bills. Rules are dead but people aren't. Don't be so heartless! By company rules, moonlighting through side gigs is grounds for dismissal. Hmm! Hmm! Too bad I've been bribed, so I can't report you now. What? As long as it doesn't affect your job, work hard. Really? Thank you so much, Mr. Green! Your egg pancakes are on me from now on. Welcome to our hotel. Are you blind? You got my shoes dirty! Don't touch me with those filthy hands! I'll complain! You'll be fired. Get out of my sight. You make me sick. How can you kick people? She dirtied my shoes. Know how expensive they are? You couldn't even afford them! I apologize for your poor experience. We can discuss any issues reasonably. So please do not bully our staff. Who are you to talk to me like that? Hello, I'm Nicole Stuart, Logistics Supervisor. You're Nicole? I kicked a mute, so what? Stop that! You pushed me? Let me tell you, my father's a Green Group shareholder. You'll both get fired for crossing me today! It was my fault just now. What do you want? She dirtied my shoes. She either licks them clean on her knees, or this isn't over. I can't let my staff lose her job because of me. Fine, I'll do it. What's going on here? Herman, why are you here? These cleaners dirtied my shoes. I just wanted an apology. So you made them kneel? Are you alright? I'm fine. The cleaner accidentally bumped her shoes while cleaning. I tried to explain. . . Accident? It's disgusting! Do you know how expensive these are? Herman, they did it on purpose. Fire them both! Ms. Ginger, your father may be a shareholder, but we follow rules at work. If staff make mistakes, we will follow procedures. Tell me exactly what happened. We have surveillance cameras. You know the consequences of lying. The cleaner accidentally dirtied Ms. Ginger's shoes. Ms. Ginger got angry so she kept bullying her. Ms. Stuart defended the cleaner and accidentally pushed Ms. Ginger. Then she. . . she demanded Ms. Stuart kneel and lick her shoes. So what? Herman, these cleaners made mistakes. It's normal to ask for an apology. She's just a country girl who needs money. Green Group values every employee's dignity. If you don't understand that, you're not welcome here. Herman, I'm sorry. I'm not the one you should apologize to. Apologize to them? They're just cleaners from the countryside! I think I've made myself clear. Leave if you won't apologize. I'm sorry. Nicole, I need to talk to you. Come with me. Ms. Ginger, Mr. Green is married. You shouldn't chase him like this. What? He's married? I never heard about this! Ever heard of Midsummer Dream? The fifteen-million necklace from the auction? Exactly. Mr. Green bought that necklace and had his wife's name engraved. He was just about to give it to her. So give up as soon as possible. You've done well as supervisor, protecting regular staff. Thank you, Mr. Green. Next time with such customers, call security immediately. But. . . I'll take responsibility for any consequence. Thank you, Mr. Green. By the way, would you like an egg pancake? Ma'am, I found the necklace. I knew Herman hadn't delivered it. Looks like I'll have to do it myself. Get that necklace to my daughter-in-law right away. Understand? Yes, Ma'am. Are you Ms. Stuart? Yes, and you are? This necklace is from Mrs. Green. For me? Yes. Nicole, did you get the necklace? Yes, thank you, Mom. But isn't it too expensive? Maybe we should return it. Not at all. Just a few bucks! Nicole, don't you like it? I do. Then, why aren't you wearing it? I'm afraid it's not appropriate. It seems too valuable. It's just a small gift from your husband. Don't worry. If you don't like it, he'll buy you ten more, or even a hundred! Until you find one you like. Okay, Mom. I'll wear it. Put it on! Mom. My daughter-in-law looks beautiful in everything! Gorgeous! Mom, I need to work now. Of course. I'll leave you be. Career comes first for women. Hahaha! Go on, go on. Bye bye! Bye bye! A double King. A double Deuce. Hello, housekeeping. Come in. Did you request cleaning? I'm out. Why are you standing there? Clean up. I have done my job. You can rest now. Wait! My earring's missing. Did you take it? You were all watching while I cleaned. Who knows if you stole it secretly? Found it. Now we have proof. Let's see who protects you this time. Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go! Before I came back, I heard Herman had promoted some woman to supervisor. He's never had women around him all these years. What tricks did you use to earn his trust? I just do my job well. I heard that you sold yourself to an old man for money. Now you reduced to cleaning, so are looking for another man? Let me tell you, you're just unwanted trash! You stole my earring Get ready to be fired. You're framing me. Push her head in the toilet. Let our hardworking cleaner taste the water she cleaned. Is it good? Stay away! Don't touch me! Let go of me! Better behave and drink this. Maybe I'll forget about the earring. Otherwise, your brother's medical bills might not get paid. Wait! That's the necklace Herman bought for his wife. I thought you were really innocent. Now I caught you red-handed stealing his necklace. Hurry up. Call the police! Ms. Ginger, what happened? This cleaner dared to steal a necklace. What? This jewelry looks expensive. I didn't steal it. My husband gave me this necklace. You shameless liar! Who do you think your husband is? This necklace is worth fifteen million. How could he afford it? Fifteen million dollars? This is Midsummer Dream, one of a kind in the world. Midsummer Dream? The one Mr. Green bought at auction abroad? Herman bought this for his wife. It even has her initials on. As his personal cleaner, you dare steal from him. The evidence is clear. What do you have to say? Ms. Ginger, when she first joined the company, I warned Mr. Green not to hire someone from the countryside. Good thing you caught her before she got away with it. Now that we know the truth, hurry up and put her in jail. No, I didn't steal it. There is a misunderstanding. Stop! What's all this noise about? Herman, this woman stole from you. No, I didn't. This necklace is mine. You bitch, Herman is here now, and you still dare to deny? What necklace? Herman, don't you remember? This necklace, the Midsummer Dream you bought abroad for your wife. I caught her wearing it while cleaning my room. Mr. Green, I didn't. Please believe me. This is a cheap copy my husband gave me, not yours. Look at the initials! I warned you to stay out of my business. Herman, she is the one who stole your property! Mr. Green, please believe me. The truth will be clear once Herman sees it. The necklace has his wife's initials on. I confirmed with Ma'am. It's N.S. N.S? Same as Nicole Stuart. . . Could she be Mrs. Green? It's just initials. Not every N.S is Mrs. Green. So Nicole really did steal it. Who knew? She seemed so honest. I can't believe she's a thief. They say she married an old man for money. That's not true. What are you waiting for? Take her to the police! Wait! This isn't my necklace. How can that be? It clearly is. It's just an ordinary necklace. What? Are you questioning me? But it's worth millions. Mr. Green wouldn't be mistaken. Keep your necklace safe. Thank you, Mr. Green. Alright. Case closed. Everyone leave. Let's go. I'm sorry. Head up. Why apologize if you did nothing wrong? You were so outspoken when we first met. Why changed? As a Green Group employee, hold your head high. We'll always have your back. Yes, Mr. Green. By the way, there's a party tomorrow night. As an outstanding employee, you'll represent the company there. A party? Is that appropriate? Forgot what I just said? Alright, Mr. Green. Don't worry. I'll do my best. Go on. Mr. Green, this necklace is indeed the one you wanted to give to your wife. How did Nicole get it? She wouldn't lie, but whoever gave her this might be suspicious. Investigate who took it. Also find out who her husband is. Yes, sir. Mr. Green, why do you care so much about Nicole? Do you like her? She's just kind-hearted. Oh, you're worried she's being deceived. Don't worry. I'll investigate thoroughly. I promise I'll dig up everything about her husband. Ms. Ginger, your dress is beautiful! How much did it cost? Thanks, it's custom-made from abroad. Yes, it's gorgeous. Wow! This dress from Will is too revealing. Who's that young lady? She's so pretty! Yes, never seen her before. I heard Mr. Green invited the new supervisor to come here. Could it be her? Don't be fooled. She's just a cleaner from the countryside. Let me see how you will act without Herman here. A cleaner? Can't be. She's wearing haute couture. Must be fake. How could a cleaner afford that? Probably a knockoff from online photos. Nicole, people like you will always be low-class, no matter how hard you try. Your common roots just show as soon as you're in. I'm not elite, but I'm not low-class either. Mr. Green. . . Oh, Mr. Green? Don't tell me you're claiming to be Mrs. Green! I never said that. Mr. Green is my distant cousin. You think you're worthy of being my cousin-in-law? This dress is one-of-a-kind. Why don't you copy something else? Aren't you ashamed? It's not a copy. Mr. Green gave it to me. How dare you! Go strip it off her. Stop! Don't touch me! Let go! Let go of me! Stay back! Don't touch me! Mr. Green has arrived. Sorry I'm late. Herman, why are you here? Should I let you bully my staff? But she's just a cleaner from the countryside. She's not just a cleaner. She's our new Logistics Supervisor. That dress was my gift for her promotion. How will you compensate for damaging it? Mr. Green, we didn't know! It's Ms. Ginger made us do it. Yes, it was her. Herman, Nicole and I were just playing. You misunderstood. Misunderstood? She did it on purpose. It's just a dress. I'll pay for it. Fine, in addition to the dress, there's fifteen million dollars Fifteen million? What should she do? Miss a penny, and you'll learn what crossing me means. Ms. Ginger, all alone? This old creep. Perfect timing. Mr. Lee, long time no see. Ms. Ginger, you grow more beautiful each day. You flatter me, Mr. Lee. When are you free? We should catch up. Mr. Lee, I'm always free. But I know someone more interested in you. It's her. A beauty indeed, but she's with Mr. Green. I wouldn't dare. Don't worry about it. She's just a cleaner. Nothing to do with Mr. Green. A cleaner? Never tried that before. If you want her, I'll help you. Hey, all alone? Ms. Ginger, what do you want? After taking fifteen million from us, can't I have a drink with you? Scared? Here, is that all right? You damaged the dress. The compensation was fair. I won't take anything else. I just don't understand why Herman trusts you so much. He's just a good boss protecting his employee. Hah! He is the ruthless CEO of Green Group, but you call him good? Ridiculous. Ms. Ginger, Mr. Green is married. Harassing me is pointless. You should let it go. Don't get cocky just because I was nice. Ah! You! Sorry about your dress. Here's a black card. Take it for your cleaning. You! Keep your money. Ms. Ginger, I was polite because you were a guest at the hotel. But this isn't the hotel. Don't think I'll always let you bully me. Haha! Beautiful lady, not feeling well? How about letting me help? Where's Nicole? She was just here. Probably off chasing rich men. What did you do to her? Are you serious? Look at my dress! She threw drinks at me. She wouldn't do that unless you provoked her first. Herman, I just don't get it. I'm from the Ginger family. My father's a major shareholder. Why are you always cold to me but care so much about a country cleaner? You're not worthy of comparison. Find Nicole. Get everyone looking. Yes, sir. Stay back! How dare you push me! Playing hard to get? Great. I like it! Where are you going? Come here. Let's have some fun! Hahahaha! Get away! Let her go! You scum! M-Mr. Green, I'm sorry, I-I-I'm sorry! Get lost! Are you okay? Hot. . . so hot. . . Help me. You've been drugged. Nicole, stay calm. Hold on, I'll get a doctor. Don't go, don't leave me. . . Nicole. Hold me. Nicole, wake up. Look at me, who am I? You're. . . Mr. Green. Help me. Where is she? Did she leave? I must tell her my marriage is fake. Blood stains? Could she be. . . Mr. Green. Wow, Mr. Green, looks like last night was intense! Get to the point. I checked the cameras. Ma'am's staff took the necklace. Did they notice? We hid them well. They won't find out. Just caught the beginning? Didn't see the man's face. Forget it. With this video, let's see how Nicole can keep staying around Herman. Herman, see? I told you she's indecent, hooking up with some random man at the party. Quickly fire her before it hurts the company's reputation. Have I been too nice lately? What made you think a woman like you could manipulate me and do whatever you want with? Herman, what do you mean? You drugged her at the party, didn't you? Herman, you misunderstand. Here's your drug purchase record. How will you explain this? So what if I drugged her? She's just a cleaner. How can you treat me like this for her? I said, you're not worthy of comparison! Do you. . . do you really like her? My business is none of yours. I'll overlook this for your father's sake. Leave on your own, or shall I have you thrown out? Where's Nicole? Mr. Green, she called in sick today. Mr. Green, do you really like her? What about your wife? It's. . . Let's set a time to divorce. Nicole, why are you free today? No work? My boss gave me the day off. So I came to see you. Nicole, what's that on your neck? Ahh, it's nothing. Don't mind. Nicole, is someone bullying you? No, don't overthink it. It's just a mosquito bite. I don't believe you. Let me see. Oh! I just remembered something. Got to go. Call if you need anything. Hey Nicole! So you're Nicole's sick brother? Who are you? I'm the one telling you the truth. I don't know you. Whether you know me doesn't matter. Aren't you curious about how your hospital bills were paid, and the surgery last year plus the recent medical bills? What are you trying to say? Your whore sister sold herself for that money. You're lying! She isn't like that. You just saw the marks on her neck. That's from entertaining men. She'll do anything for money. You're lying! See for yourself. You can recognize your own sister, right? This. . . this can't be true. This isn't my sister. . . Nicole, this is what happens when you cross me. Here's your egg pancake. Already paid. Thanks. One egg pancake, please. Hey, why are you avoiding me? That night. . . Mr. Green, that was an accident. Is it because of that man? Do you love him that much? If he truly loves you, why have you never mentioned him? Why does he let you struggle after marriage? Whatever he's like, I'm his wife. He saved my brother. I can't betray him. He's just a fraud. That necklace he gave you was stolen. He doesn't deserve you. Who deserves me then? Don't forget, Mr. Green, you're married. It's not what you think. We're. . . Nicole! Nicole, why is your phone off? The hospital called. Your brother's in trouble. Quickly go to the hospital! What? Doctor! Doctor! How's my brother? Well, prepare yourselves. The patient was emotionally shocked. We did our best. No, Doctor, my brother is such a good, obedient boy. He can't be dead! You're lying, right? I don't believe it! Nicole, calm down. Don't be too sad. He wouldn't want this. What are you talking about? The patient isn't dead. What? But you said. . . I mean, you should prepare for surgery costs. Hey. Why don't you two listen properly? Frank. Nicole. Thank goodness you're okay. After another surgery in a couple of days, you can go home. Nicole, I don't want surgery. Why not? Why don't you want surgery? Worried about money? Don't worry. I can earn it. Nicole, I've burdened you long enough. If it weren't for me. . . It's all my fault for being weak. It's all my fault! Don't move! Nicole, stop lying to me. I have known everything. Know what? How did you get the medical fees? I told you, from a friend. Stop lying, Nicole. Someone told me you sold yourself to an old man for me. How can I stay here with ease after knowing that? I. . . Don't move! Stay still, Frank! Nicole, you're the best sister. I won't let you sacrifice yourself for me. Frank, don't worry about it. You must be thirsty after lying here. Have some water. Nicole, please stop. Nicole, Nicole! I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Nicole, I don't want surgery. Don't persuade me. Just let me die. You're still underage. Just listen to adults. What happened to your hand? Who are you? The old man you mentioned. You. . . you're the man who married my sister? But. . . I paid your medical bills. Your sister and I aren't what you think. I truly love her and want to be with her. What are you saying? If you want him to accept treatment, listen to me. Is that true? But why do you like her? With your status, you must have many women around. Let me ask you, why do you love her? She's my sister. I accept her no matter what. Same here. She's my wife. I love her no matter what. Nicole, is it true? But I feel you don't like him. You married him just for my medical bills, right? Mr. Green, thanks. Frank finally agreed to surgery. About what happened, you have nothing else to say? The hospital said you paid. I'll repay you soon. What I said to Frank about spending my life with you, I meant it. Mr. Green, we're not right for each other. We were just acting, and that night was an accident. It's you who were drugged that night, not me. I knew what I was doing and how I felt. Mr. Green, let me go. I know. I know you're concerned about my marriage. I won't rush you to respond. Let me handle everything first, then I'll properly pursue you, okay? But I'm married. That man doesn't love you. If you feel indebted for your brother's bills, there are other ways to repay him besides sacrificing yourself. Even if you don't choose me at last, I hope you end up with someone you truly love. Bring your marriage certificate. We'll divorce at the registry next week. Could the certificate be in that package I sent Mom? Mom, are you free these days? I think something got mixed in with the clothes I sent you. I haven't opened those clothes yet. What did you put in? I'll send it back. Mom doesn't know I'm married. We're divorcing anyway, better not tell her. Don't open it. Mom, I miss you. I'll come to get you. Stop! What beggar dares enter here? Don't you know where this is? How dare you barge in? I'm here to see someone. You! Well, well, I was wondering who it could be. I could smell the stench from far away. Winnie Ginger? This is Ocean City's villa district. Only those important people live here. It's not a place for just anyone to stroll in. Guard, watch carefully. Don't let her sneak in. Yes. I heard Mrs. Green returns today. Once I win her over, I'll definitely be Herman's wife. Get her out of here. Got it. Move along now. Hurry up and go. Please, do me a favor. I just go in to find someone. I'll be quick. Do you want me to be tough? Don't make me use force. Go, now! Go! Stop! Who's this beggar? Hmph! Open your eyes wide and look carefully. Mrs. Green! I-I'm so sorry. I didn't recognize you. My mistake! Mrs. Green, you live here? Just a few days, why Mrs. Green again? Not Mom anymore? I'm here for the marriage certificate to divorce your son. I just can't say Mom. Mrs. Green, how do you know this country girl? Nonsense! She's my daughter-in-law. You lousy guard! Who do you think you are? What? She's Mr. Green's wife? Mr. Green? Oh right, my husband is also named Green. What's his name again? You dare stop my daughter-in-law? Don't come here tomorrow! Mrs. Green, I was wrong! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Please give me another chance! Nicole, why are you here? Oh, I know. Did my son tell you I was coming back? You came to see me! Haha! Mrs. Green, I'm meeting someone inside. I need to go. Wait! No, wait! Nicole! Herman must have upset her again. It's just a few days! You brat, where are you? Get back here now! Wanda, where are you going? Ma'am? Why are you dressed like a garbage picker? It's the latest post-apocalyptic industrial style. What do you know? Oh Wanda, Wanda, you can't leave. You. . . You're the most important person to me. How can I live without you? Is it the money? I'll pay you double! No, triple. How about quintuple? Oh Ma'am, what are you saying? I'm not leaving. Don't try to fool me. You came with this sack when you started, and now you're leaving with it. My daughter's visiting. It's something she wants. All of this is for her. Really? Oh my dear Wanda, I'm glad you won't leave. Haven't you not seen your daughter in ages? You're wearing this to see her? Is. . . something wrong? Nicole. Mom? Why are you dressed like this? This is. . . Ma'am made me wear this. They're too much! How could they dress you like this? Even beggars dress better. Are they bullying you? Quit if you don't like it. I can support you. I'm fine, don't worry. Weren't you looking for something? Is it? Mom, I didn't mean to hide it from you. Your brother's been in hospital for over a year. I may be old, but I'm not as fragile as you think. This is my savings over the years. I've heard the village gossip. You're my daughter. I know who you are. Here. Return the money to them. The rest is your decision. Mom. You've had it hard these years. Mom. If you're tired, quit. I'll support you. I work for Mr. Green. He pays me well. Mr. Green? Which Mr. Green? The CEO of Green Group. What? I didn't know my mom worked for Mr. Green too. Mom, are you close with Mr. Green? He's rarely home throughout the year. I mainly care for his mother. Does he not get along with his mother? They seem fine. He married for his mother's sake. She adores her daughter-in-law. What if Mr. Green divorces? With her temperament, she wouldn't allow it. Stop the car! Nicole, why are you here? You keep this marriage certificate all along. Do you love him that much? Mr. Green, it's none of your business. Remember, you're not divorced yet. They say Mrs. Green loves trendy fashion. I carefully picked these stylish items. Once I win over his mother, Herman will have to marry me. Hey, you're the Green's housekeeper? Perfect timing. Get me coffee, milk no sugar. You. . . What's the holdup? Get my coffee, hurry. How dare you speak to me like that? Do you know who I am? You? Just a housekeeper. That's the uniform of the Green family's maids. I noticed that. Miss, I've been with the Green family for years. Why hadn't I seen you before? How did you get in? You haven't seen me before, but that'll change. Oh? After all, soon I'll be the lady of this house. Get your own coffee. I don't serve a woman like you. Just a maid, how dare you put on airs. You dirty old woman should be grateful for the food they give you. Want me to tell Herman to throw you out? Go ahead. Let's see if Herman Green can really throw me out. Such attitude! You're just a maid. What's wrong with me throwing you out? Whom are you throwing out? Herman. Herman, you're back. Ms. Ginger, I told you we're not close. Keep your distance. Haha! I thought she was something special. Just another gold digger. Not good enough! Hahaha! Herman, it was my fault last time. Today, I specially came to apologize. Look, I brought all these carefully chosen gifts for your mother. Please forgive me. Take these away. The Greens don't want them. You're just a maid! Stop interrupting my conversation with Herman. Herman, give her a lesson! Who are you calling a maid? What, she's not? If you're not the Green's maid, how dare you trespass! You should be taught a lesson and thrown out! You're the one who should leave! Do you know who she is? Who is she? She's my mother. I'm sorry, Mrs. Green. I didn't know you were Mr. Green's mother in those clothes. I'm so sorry, Mrs. Green. Don't call me Mrs. Green. I can't afford it. Just keep calling me a dirty maid like before. Herman, is this the woman you like? She is the reason you want to divorce my daughter-in-law? You. . . Herman, you have someone you like? Mom, it's not her. I knew my son couldn't have such poor taste. She is a woman with only looks, no brains. This kind of woman is just like the supporting role in the dramas Oh, no, she's like a villain. A bad bitch! Herman, who do you like? No way. . . That cleaner? Why? I've loved you so long, got surgery for you, made my father invest in your company. Why won't you even look at me? I don't like you. No matter what you did will not change that. That's right. My son belongs with my daughter-in-law. Not everyone deserves my son. Mom, I'll only be with someone I love. Marrying her was a mistake. Even without the certificate, I'm getting divorced. Take your things and leave. Mom, I've got things to do. I need to leave now. Herman, have some eat first! Herman. . . Looks like I'm really losing my daughter-in-law. Nicole? Impossible! How could she be Herman's wife? She's my daughter-in-law, genuine article. No way. I don't understand my son. . . They can't be together. I won't allow it. Nicole, if I suffer, you will too. I'll post that video of you with that man online. Ma'am, what's wrong now? Wanda, my son's determined to divorce my daughter-in-law. What should I do? Ma'am, let the young ones find their own happiness. Just let it go. I can't accept it. Wanda, should I do like those dramas, and offer his love interest eight million to leave him? Will it work? Madam, that will only make young master angrier. Oh, I'm just heartbroken. Let me cry a bit more before giving him the certificate. Oh, my dear daughter-in-law! Yo! Let's hang out sometime. You know me? How could I not? You're famous now everywhere. Your video's all over the internet. Green Group's new supervisor slept her way to the top! I. . . What, only rich men can have you? We're not good enough? Nicole, your video's Did you offend someone? Who would post such a thing? Nicole, hurry up and explain yourself! I know you're not what they say. Isn't that her in the video? That man's clothes aren't cheap. Found yourself a sugar daddy, huh? Is he enough for you? Hahaha! Mr. Green, the video of you and Nicole that night is online. They're saying she slept her way up. What? Drive back to the office. But you have a several-hundred-million contract meeting. I said back to the office. Yo, man, be careful what you say. Our manager Mr. Wade got demoted for crossing her. Watch out, you might lose your security job. Yeah, wonder who her sugar daddy is. We can't afford to offend him and lose our job. That's right. Let's just do our jobs quietly. Unlike her, sleeping her way up. Though she does look good in that video. Hey, where'd it go? It's real. The trending topics disappeared too. Nicole, your man must be powerful to protect you like this. Nicole, say something! How can you stay here muetly if you don't explain? I can't explain this. Herman helped me that night. I can't drag him down. What's to explain? The news tells the truth. That's why she can't explain herself. She's just a whore who slept her way up. -I'm not. -If you're not who's the man in the video? I am. Nicole and I are just in a normal relationship. I'll release a statement. Anyone dares to maliciously sharing the video will face legal consequences against those responsible. Understood? Yes, Mr. Green. Get out if you understand. Nicole, I'm sorry. I handled this poorly. Winnie released the video. I've dealt with her. The Gingers are bankrupt now. She won't bother you again. Mr. Green, I'm just an ordinary country girl. You don't need to do so much for me. It's bad for your reputation. You're not ordinary. You're the only one I've ever liked. I'd do anything for you. My marriage situation is complicated. I'll explain once I handle it. And let me be clear, if you haven't resolved your marriage, I won't be with you. Nicole, does this mean you're giving me a chance? I said after I handel it. Good, I'll wait. I promise I'll wait. My dear daughter-in-law. -Wanda. -Yes? Is today my son's divorce day? Yes, ma'am. You've been crying for two days. I just can't accept it. Ma'am, didn't you promise to give young master the marriage certificate today? Can they divorce without it? Of course. Fine, I'll go. Let me fix my makeup first. I want to look nice when I see my daughter-in-law last time . Is this young master and his wife? Yes, it's my beautiful daughter-in-law. Ma'am, I need to tell you something. So, my daughter-in-law is your daughter? Oh, my dear Wanda! Hahaha! Turns out you're my son's mpther in-law! But ma'am, I need to remind you, they're planning to divorce today. Oh dear, how cruel! Just found out we're in-laws and they're separating us! Wait. . . My son. . . This plot seems familiar. With my drama expertise. . . A flash marriage? No way. They didn't even know each other? My son couldn't be that stupid! Mr. Green, traffic's bad. Mrs. Green's calling. Don't answer. Why isn't he here yet? That looks like Mr. Green's car. Is he also getting divorced today? Herman! Herman, help me! Did you hear Nicole's voice? No. Mr. Green, are you lovesick? Don't fall in love too much. Mrs. Green's coming herself. Mr. Green. Mom, I'm getting divorced today no matter what. You brat, look who your wife is. You're really something! You're married and don't even know who your own wife is. Hmph, claiming to love her. Mom, what do you mean? Here, check the marriage certificate and you'll see. Nicole? What? It really is Nicole. No wonder I thought she looked familiar. She was dressed so poorly then, I didn't recognize her. Mr. Green, all this trouble for nothing. The woman you love is actually your wife! I can't believe I'm already her husband. So embarrassing. I always thought you, my son, a CEO, should have at least a forced marriage or marriage before love story. But a flash marriage without knowing each other? Are you worthy of being a CEO? Mom, watch fewer dramas. Hurry up and contact my daughter-in-law. Nicole. Herman, it's Winnie. Stop struggling. You can't escape. What are you doing? Why did you catch me? Are you crazy? That's right. Yes, I am crazy. Why did you have to steal Herman from me? I've loved him for so long, but you were already married and kept it secret! You misunderstand. Misunderstand? I saw your marriage certificate. Still trying to lie? So Herman Green is my husband? Winnie! Stay back! Herman, you finally came. Let her go. So you really came for her? You love her that much? Leave her alone. Take it out on me. Fine, take the knife then. Herman, don't listen to her! She's insane! You would risk your life for this woman? Fine, none of us will survive tonight. Nicole! What a close call. We almost died. Weren't you tied up? I'm from the countryside. I've tied up countless pigs. Her knots couldn't hold me. A bit later and I'd have escaped myself. Thank goodness you're okay. Nicole, I have something important to tell you. Actually, the man you married. . . I know it's you. Can we not divorce then? Herman! Herman, what's wrong? That stab was pretty deep. Herman! Herman! Herman! Mom, I'm heading out now. Nicole, you promised to shop with me today. Don't let that brat steal you away. Mom, Nicole and I have something to do. She can't accompany you. You rascal, always hogging her. Can't I have my daughter-in-law for one day? Mom, we really have something to do. Really. What can't wait? Mom, Nicole's pregnant. I'm taking her for a checkup. What? Pregnant! Oh my, oh my, I'm going to be a grandmother! Hahaha! After a year of marriage, Herman, I thought you. . . What are you saying, Mom? Mom, we need to confirm at the hospital. Alright, she won't listen anyway. Let's go. Hey, what if I'm not pregnant? Then I'll just have to try harder.
