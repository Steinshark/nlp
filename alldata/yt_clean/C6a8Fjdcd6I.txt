No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! OK! That is actually really cool! - Hi, I'm Josh. And this is JOLLIBIE! And today, we're making - Weird? - So, Gabie, you haven't seen this? I have one. Yo, what? JOLLY? - OK. Wow. Along with the team, yeah. And it comes up as a tube. But I was thinking, how about we make First up, gin and tonic. - Oooh! - This is a special tool, That I experimented with to get this off. - Is it that hard to open? - Yo! That is very frozen. It contains real gin and tonic. Oh! That.. farted! OK! How drunk are we gonna be? Wow! Gin and tonic? I thought we were gonna eat something. That is so sweet. It's like, if they made alcohol for children. - Oh, my gosh. - I'll squeeze enough for you, too. Woah, so it's like a candy. Have some, have some. It's really satisfying to bite into. What do you think? It's actually good. It's too alcoholic. You can taste the gin, you can taste the tonic. That texture is unlike anything I've ever chewed. - It melts away so quickly. Next up, guys. - Whisky. You'll love this. This is just straight up whisky jello? Basically. Woah... - Oh, my gosh. - That can't be that good. I mean, that's a cocktail. It's quite sweet, originally. It tastes very strange. Wow, look at that. - It literally just looks like honey. That's such a fascinating texture. I don't want to eat it now. What is happening? It tastes like But the whisky flavour is perfect. The kick is gone. Super strange texture. What do you make of it, Gabie? It's cold, it's like having It's so weird. Next up. OK. I see the theme here. This one's a bit more melted. - Be careful. Be careful. What's it taste like? Tastes like tequila! I do not like that. No, just go for it. Quick bite. What do you think? That's not a good sound. I just literally remembered what we did. - And, I'm nervous. - Already? - What did you say? OK, I'll just show you it. I'm guessing it's all downhill from here, No, no. Is this fish.. fish sauce? No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! We made a frozen honey jelly It might taste like the dipping sauce. Can you drink fish sauce? Definitely not. How do you think fish stay hydrated? So many things wrong What was is it they said &quot;We were too preoccupied with &quot;We never stopped to ask ourselves Because if you'd even stopped Would've been able to realise, Jolly fish slush. Oh! I just smelled it! Oh, my gosh! It's not coming out. It's constipated. Great. Way to make me, If there was any way for me Go for it, Josh. - The smell.. Chew. Quick. This is a bad idea. Go on, Gabie! Go on, Gabie! This is JOLLIBIE! Salty! Oh my gosh! No, no, no, no! - Go for it. Go for it. - TikTok slushie. You got it. You got it. Little taste. Ollie, go for it. Oh, mate. You are brave. It's literally, it's literally, I couldn't. - That made me gag so hard. It's horrible. Something about the texture Give me gin and tonic. &quot;Give me gin and tonic.&quot; Ollie's vomiting into a bin. How do you possibly conceive of something Last up. Marmite? No, you didn't. There's just no way that's real. No! Rock, paper, scissors! No! Dammit! Rock, paper, scissors! Thing is, I know I need to hold it together Because otherwise there's no way Watch the bravest face Good luck, mate. Oh, be careful. My gut is already, like, heaving. - That's a lot. That is a lot. Ollie, I don't enjoy this. Oh no, don't do this to yourself! - You're an idiot. You're crying. No! Why am I doing this? What is the prize? Oh, my gosh. I can feel it coating the inside of my body. It's not that bad. I feel like it's not as bad as I was expecting. I can literally feel it on my... - Oesophagus. You know, maybe this killed Oh, you're having more? That's spicy. Yeah, that's spicy. It's not, yeah, it's quite bad. - It's really freakin' bad. It's kinda bad. See, normally when you have spicy stuff. The first ten minutes are agony And it drives you insane. You sweat. This, skips all of that. The second one is worse. Why did I have some more? Your insides are going to be ruined. OK. What do you think? Let's stick with honey. I think it's getting worse. - I'm shivering. Why are you worried about her? - You should be more worried about me. You'll probably just vomit it all up. - Superpower! Well, that was an experience. I was so excited to film And this is what I get? Oh, man. You gotta stop bringing over What? Why are you saying that? She's livid. Before it gets any uglier, - See you guys JOLLY soon.
