Today we are going to be trying tea and biscuits, American style. Oh! I saw the tea and the biscuits and I thought that's very English and I saw the American flags. A little bit confused. Yeah. Growing up, we used to have afternoon tea every day. We came in from school and we'd have tea, cake and biscuits every day. Every day? Every day. This is not what we're trying today. This looks like a plate of biscuits, Dad. It's actually a red herring. No! I was just enjoying that. Yeah, I know. I know! There's no tea. Today we're trying tea and biscuits, American style, specifically Southern style. Okay. Tea and biscuits. And my favourite way to have biscuits in the States is with gravy. What? That's not right. Not just any gravy, but sausage gravy to be precise. You're kidding. Let's step back for a minute. What do you think of when you look at that? Well, they're scones. Wow. Okay. I think you literally just declared war. While it appears similar to a scone, it's actually not a scone. Help yourself. Grab a biscuit. I've said this before. That's a biscuit? We had an American friend of ours freshly made these for us. This morning. Cheers. Buttery. Well, it's very nice. It's good, eh? It's just not a biscuit. Okay. As buttery and yummy as it is by itself, what you really need. Oh, you put it on the biscuit? On the biscuit. Look at that. I'm just going to say what we're all thinking. It doesn't look the most appetizing. No. It looks like something you'd see at a bus stop in the morning. Oh, yeah. I was trying not to think about that. I'm smelling the sausage. Spiced sausage. Yeah. This is your first time trying biscuits and gravy. That is good. Oh my. That is good. Fantastic. Oh, how glorious is that? Wow, that is legit, actually. Wow. That is really legit. I've missed this so much. Just a tiny bit of heat. Maybe a little bit of chili powder. This is so good. So soft, warming. So how does this compare, Dad? Well, it doesn't. Yeah. It's completely different. Absolutely amazing. When I think of Southern comfort food, it's the first thing that comes to my mind. Of all the things that we tried in the South, I feel like this is one of the things I crave, The most when we're not in the States, is just really good biscuits and gravy. We've said it before. We've said t before, I'll say it again. It's like a warm mouth hug. A hug for your mouth. How have I missed this? That's a life changer. Wow. That's exactly how I felt the first time I tried it. Yeah. That's your biscuit. In the South, they also drink a lot of tea. Do they really? Not necessarily together. I mean, I feel like in England, biscuits and tea are a sort of mandatory combo. You rarely have one without the other. Okay. This is different. This is homemade Southern iced tea. In the South, they just call this tea. It's not iced tea. It's just tea. Right. Alright. Cheers. Cheers, guys. Oh, I feel like we're in the South again. Oh, it's tea. It's tea. So it's interesting, isn't it? Different cultures drink their teas differently. And does it go with this? Let me just see. Oh, yeah. The thing is, I feel like biscuits and tea, no matter which part of the world you're in, it's just a match made in heaven. I'm interested as to, like, where did the confusion arise? Maybe that they were trying to make normal biscuits and just used the wrong flour. Oh, yeah. That's true. And came up with something better. Yeah. Well different. Oh, so you don't think that's better than English biscuits? It's different. Who is the better artist? Van Gogh or Leonardo da Vinci? Da Vinci. Definitely, Da Vinci. Wow. Do you think so. 100%. He is arguably the greatest artist of all time. He would wipe the floor with Van Gogh. Van Gogh wouldn't even hear him coming. He's got no ear. He just... Okay, so I think your missing the point there. I think that... It's so different to an English biscuit. It's just a different type of thing. Good first experience. Really good. Fantastic. I'm so glad that you like that as much as I do. Honestly, the words you used perfectly summed up my first experience. It feels like a life changing moment. Yeah. Where has this been all our lives? It's like just... You thought that all paintings were like Van Gogh and then you see Da Vinci. You see the Mona Lisa and the Louvre. You're like, oh my gosh, there's other painters. Okay. Another very popular way to have biscuits is with fried chicken. Oh my goodness. With some southern style American fried chicken. Do you eat much fried chicken? No. Okay. Roast chicken maybe. Okay. But I could be persuaded. Okay. Grab another biscuit. Help yourself, Dad. Yes. I can't get my head around you keep calling these biscuits. Oh yeah. We do need to find a new name. We're throwing you. We're throwing you off. I'm cutting mine in half. I'm just doing what you're doing, Josh. Oh, the soft buttery bit of the biscuit in the middle. Oh my goodness. Oh my gosh. It's so good. These biscuits are incredible. Holy moly. My impression is with American food, there are very few rules. So I think you can just eat it however you want. However, I do want to grab a couple of tenders and make a little biscuit chicken sandwich. Oh wow. Look at that. Heck. Is that what you did? Wow. It's like a buttery hug. Oh wow. That is properly buttery. Holy moly. It tastes so good and yet it tastes so bad for you as well. You know? You might be thinking, it's a little bit dry. We have some hot honey and we have some ranch? I never know how to pronounce that word. Ranch. You go with ranch. Okay. Presumably that's got chilli flakes in it. Yeah, are you skeptical of chilli? Well, chilli with honey. And what they do is they feed the bees a curry the night before. How's that? Well that's quite nice actually. It works. Yeah. That's does work. It actually does. This is real comfort food, you know. What would you say is our equivalent of a comfort food? Well, I guess it's different for different people. Yeah. Personally, I'd go for cheese. Okay, you just serve yourself up a big cheese board after a bad day. I want some gravy on this. Oh yeah. Look at that. Wow. Going in. So a bit of gravy, bit of chicken. Wow. Fried chicken, sausage gravy. There's a real dichotomy between how the gravy looks and how it tastes. Because it's really hard to conceive of a food that looks more disgusting than that. Right? I mean... If your drain gets blocked and you dig it out, it's going to look like that. It is. It's going to look like that, right? And yet, you would never eat that and expect it to taste as good as this. No. You know? Try that just on there. Oh, look at that. Oh. Only one way to find out. How's that? Oh, that's good. And actually, the moistness of the gravy really helps the fried chicken. It works. This is so much more flavour than I feel like anything that we eat regularly. But like... This is a brunch meal. Imagine just having that for brunch. Why are we bothering with avocado on toast? Let alone beans on toast. Avocado on toast is perhaps a little healthier than this. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Good point. Good point. At this point, though, when it tastes this good, health has just gone completely out of the picture. I'm not even thinking twice about health. You just summarized America's entire approach to cuisine. Well, this... This certainly helps your mental health, I think. Which is a valid consideration, you know? That's why it's comfort food. It's comforting. Our American friend that made this for us said, If you're gonna do a little introduction to American style biscuits and gravy, There's one other thing she really wanted to make us. And she said, &quot;I bet you've never had a proper cinnamon roll.&quot; Which I thought was a bit leftfield. Yeah. You know, I thought we had quite a nice cinnamon rolls. Cinnamon roll, yeah. These are cinnamon rolls. They almost look like Danish pastries, don't they? They do. They're also covered in what I believe is, like, icing. Sugar. More sugar. Because why not? I'm very excited about this. Very excited about this. Help yourself, Dad. I'm gonna go with the child's size. I think that's probably wise. Can you smell that? Oh, my gosh. Freshly baked this morning. Cinnamon rolls. Cheers, guys. Cheers. Yeah. Holy crap. That is... Yeah. That is something else. I mean, compared to that, every English cinnamon roll I've had is like a forward roll in primary school. And this is, like, Simone Biles just, like, breaking all records. It's got that similar sort of warm stodginess to it, That when you bite in, it just gives you comfort. Yeah. It's dense, but elegant. Like Simone Biles. Wow! She's very muscular. What do you mean dense? Muscular. Yeah, small and muscular. True. She's amazing. Okay, good, good. You're safe. It's a compliment. Dense not usually used as a compliment. Very good. What's interesting about this is the dough is different. From the biscuit. But it's not that different. It's like they got a similar dough and then wrapped it in the cinnamon glaze. It's like it's... But it is glorious. We do have a lot of cinnamon rolls here in the UK. I quite like them, but I think they're often a lot lighter. Whereas this is very, like you said, dense. Thick. But it's so good. Less professional. Obviously less medals. I mean... She got so many medals. Yeah. Like seriously. Let someone else have a go. You're still on there. How are you feeling? This is good. It's good. I wouldn't be able to have it every day. No, this is quite intense. You know what? Come back from school, three o'clock every day. We've got the biscuits and gravy. Wow. It's tea time. American tea time. Can you imagine? Oh my gosh.
