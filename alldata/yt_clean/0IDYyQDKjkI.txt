Plants Vs Zombies has been beaten people have gone as far as making the "nuts there's probably been a grass so one day, whilst playing garden warfare, i suddenly froze...but then However, it made me think up the idea... Quickly before we begin, Mr. going to reach 25,000 subscribers So to prove him wrong, make sure you Heading back to the challenge, Here's the rules: we're actually doing this challenge Dave chooses half of your plants FOR YOU. I can ONLY use plants from that doesn't include plant abilities like NO POWER-UPS, NO LEVELLING UP, other no other cheating stuff- you get the idea- and every gimmick level where im forced to but hell i'm going to try anyway- so without further ado let's beat "plants vs welcome to the tutorial world, where luckily the the first level isn't much to worry about, having our main character peashooter so once beating the level, we unlocked... The second garden warfare character is going to CARRY this challenge for us, i don't think you realise what's in store For now though, sunflower greatly increases our sun production and allows us to get we get given this nut dude but he aint part in level 3, I DID NOT PLACE THIS NUT...cactus did- and once again we breezed through the level- with the same going for level 4, rewarding popcap chose the corn throwing man over YOU DAY 5 unlocks the whole of the lawn, which somehow already has walnuts planted in and this cabbage dude decided fun! yea not happening buddy, GET OUT OF HERE- we continued the level with our peashooters, as well as these walnuts who've decided to and once taking out the final conehead, yes, he fell over and i found hot sauce in his pocket. to which dave stole it and poured the dave after CONSUMING said taco is about to EXPLODE- but actually so after talking to his um...talking car- he travels back in time, as anyone we're in ancient Egypt now, well maybe that smell is coming but after dave stopped talking about being the first level of ancient egypt- The white-knighting walnuts have returned so we went ahead and fought through the until we came across mr. sun man, who although he literally was taken out by this we then went on to the powerup I DIDN'T PLACE THESE GUYS- in which i tried amount of zombies just trying to TEMPT me into and after making it to the final wave, i had to which they respawned instantly so regardless, we received the world map, level 3 had Penny giving me a few bands, me spend a rack on some plant food. Where am these early levels are obviously quite a cakewalk, yet dave over here talking about &quot;these zombies On day four here was our first real issue, take a look at this conveyor belt real why does this plant got dreads bruh- the conveyor belt levels will likely be the which plants are coming next, along with however luckily the early levels give me i guess they think i suck at this game- so i beat the level without and then was forced to upgrade this dave reminds me that &quot;hey, look you can buy but i just ignored his demand and went whilst it may not look like it now, the in the near future...but not the far future i want to make iceberg lettuce shut yo fatass up dave- Day 6, the first boss level in this challenge, and it so happens to be the first level i guess they're taking my and look, I REALLY wanted to see if i could but legitimately, the only thing that who was a cancelled character for battle for but even then, the iceberg doesn't show up before the mowers can wipe the board, so try to ignore these levels that so we pushed through day 6, day 7, are finally over, finally giving us that's right the OG garden so in day 8 we deployed our heroes its wild how the game suddenly became a whole however after moving on from this level, i got just adverts that FORCE you to watch them with no but half of these adverts are just broken what are you promoting here, the colour black? we went on to beat day 9 like it was nuffin, and despite day 10, shoving all i just used cactus' piercing ability hieroglyphic cuboids day 11 had me slightly worried when the talking truck told me you HAVE TO BRING It made me think, welp it's over...again- but as she drove off, we were given not only with having access to 2 of we managed to clear out all in day 12, we had a rough start with a conehead making it halfway down our field but chomper, i will admit, is relatively even being able to take out this zombie another strange feature i didn't expect was as approaching zombies would force him into day 13 had us placing plants next to dave's thought these guys needed protecting otherwise but it turns out i'm just not which i didn't understand until WAYYY later- day 14 unlocked the zen garden, with a before heading into day 15, we got hit with dave then tells us there's a plant plants don't have arms, how did they phone you- in an attempt to &quot;save&quot; these endangered plants, ground, but unsurprisingly, that didn't work- so we had to instead fight every single his taco-eating ass just to dig up 3 sunflowers- luckily we passed the level with flying colours, which can't be said for this advert since there day 16 happened so fast that the sunflowers i day 17 told me i'm not allowed to place but due to cactus' dual wield up-down i resorted to primarily placing him and my present for beating it was... funny enough, whilst loading into the next day, out and stretch himself out in pain, transforming Dave then tells us we're going up no, not THAT peashooter, I'm talking entirely on this channel so go watch Unfortunately, without having the ability I had to resort to using basic cactus' where these camel panel... built like a wet FLANNEL- suffered the most with cactus at this point i thought dave was just us to NEVER have more than 16 plants all whilst Jack Black from Jumanji and in my first attempt of this sunflowers bee-lining it straight into these all until i realised these dudes have a but that didn't stop Jack Black from burning after playing more carefully around Jack Black, and by that i mean just sacrificing we beat the level rewarding us to repeater, unfortunately repeater isn't in garden having to once again protect I tried to play more strategically against my sunflowers to eat him way before he and surprisingly this meta was working! so as Jack Black rebooted to the bottom wh- hey excuse me timeout Mr. Black- HOW does that shit work? so you're telling me THIS chomper was able to eat carried away, with him licking his lips n shit- after my tantrum i attempted to avoid using building a solid defence with a row of cactus, only plant being able to stop him being chomper, his mouth wasn't even closed this time, was you after some trial and error, we peashooter using his PEA GATLING, day 21 threw me in with no explanation, having but fortunately for us that whilst we haven't fully unlocked him yet, kernel with his sun cost being relatively his bigger better butter ability, so once the team was built, i paired him up with cactus and we were farewell kernel corn..*snfh* I'LL MISS YOU- dave mustve got bored or just day 22's objectives were literally copy but this time round, there was a to be honest, i completely forgot about the however due to the gravestones i despite this sun disadvantage, i managed to day 23 made us go against our first but activating chompers um...sucking ability- we were able to pull him in, then push Day 24! a pea shooter level once again, where randomly place these chompers in a pattern in the gold statue dudes fortunately walked in those however with day 24 completed, it was time to my taco tastes so clos- shut your fatass up- the level began and i just had to PRAY that some of our garden warfare plants would okay cant use that one, okay...cant use that one, not that one, nope not him he got rejected, no it turns out this game is just racist against beat this level as normal, but hey look on the we took down zomboss like and he gave up the key to the pirate seas... but that'll have to be for next time as there was ancient Egypt beaten with So if you wanna see us take on me know in the comments below or simply like
