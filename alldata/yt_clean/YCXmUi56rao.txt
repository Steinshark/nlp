[Hannah] Do you want to share [Brady] Uh, do you know what? [H] It looks really appetizing. [H] Don't you think? [H] This bread's been squashed [B] Yeah, I love that you went for white bread. [H] No. None of that, none of that. Okay, if we're gonna do this fairly then, Brady, But that does leave me with a bit of a quandary, what a half a sandwich is? Because look, you know, the ham isn't exactly even... You know, how do you- If this sandwich is a bit badly made, how can you work out where halfway is? [B] Well, first of all, What is half a sandwich? [H] I want exactly half of this slice, I want exactly half of the ham, and I want exactly half of that slice. [B] Does the cut have to be straight? And it doesn't matter I want it even if it's like that. But thankfully, So, the Ham Sandwich Theorem says that when you have three objects you will be able to cut each of them And.. The best way to explain this Let's say that you want to cut But... Let's imagine someone's already come past Just so it's a bit harder. [B] Okay. [H] Hmm, that's a bit better. [B] So it's less obvious where to cut. Let's muck it up a little bit more, Less obvious where to cut. this slice of bread. Now if I hold the knife here, all of the bread is on And if I move the knife over there, now, all of the bread So what that means is that there must be where exactly half of the bread and half of the bread [B] The crossover point. But that was me and moving through that way. It would also be true or... [Cracks up] Slightly more difficult So any angle at which I hold the knife, where half of the bread Regardless of the fact that the bread is all, So! That's fine. Now, let's imagine Let's make it a little bit more difficult, [H] [Laughs] [H] Yum. [Both laughing] [H] Is it 'cus [B] I hadn't thought about that! [Both continue laughing] [H] &quot;Welcome to cooking [B] Right, yeah. [H] We already know that we can cut So what we can do is we can let's say like that, where we know that 50% and 50% is on that side. But, what you'll notice is that all of our ham, now, But because we know You can rotate this knife Which means that there must be a point in the middle, Where exactly half of the ham is on this side of the knife and half on the other side? [B] There's one magic line. Now, the third component: this extra slice of bread. Yum! Brady, look at this delicious sandwich, I've made! [B] Nice, nice. You can apply the same principles. It's slightly trickier to explain this one, but the idea is the same. Except in this case, you now have the angle of the knife to play with as well. So you're sorta sweeping over, turning it around and rotating it that way, and that way. There should be a way where you can make a cut through all three perfectly in half. One small thing; we know for a fact that this line exists. The theory doesn't actually help you find it very much. So, there's that. [B]: Who came up with this? That's Banach, from a Banach Tarski thing, where you can rearrange a sphere to make two spheres that look basically the same as the original one did. And, but then it was proved in the N dimensional case, by Stone and Tukey. [B]: There seem to be a lot of mathematical problems that center around things that happen in lunch rooms and tea breaks, isn't there? [H]: Weird, huh? I know. [H]: Exactly. Yeah, you'd always think that maybe that was the most productive part of a mathematicians day. See these five circles on the screen? Do you think you can draw a line through them, that will divide them into two equal parts with the same area and perimeter? ***Spoiler Alert*** Apparently the answer is yes, and it uses the Ham Sandwich problem that you just watched a video about.
