This is the first one, &quot;Mocro Maffia&quot;. This was published in 2014. I sold about 140,000 copies. The book became a social phenomenon. It even inspired a fictional series We just wanted to scare them. They started acting crazy, The Dutch witnessed to take control of the cocaine trade. &quot;Mocro Maffia&quot; is a slang term to refer to the Moroccan mafia. As we all know, a lot of hashish What is the epic center It's Amsterdam, with the coffee shops. The whole infrastructure Then in Colombia, the cocaine cartels They started shipping The cocaine went over That's how it started. The guys who were running That's the explanation The port of Rotterdam for the Mocro Maffia. As the largest port in Europe, In 2021, customs managed This is only a small part I've seen guys who went from young guys with a North Face jacket to multimillionaire who owns in a time span of three years. This can happen. It's not the gold dream, That's why Ridouan Taghi of Dutch criminals. He started dealing marijuana. Then at a certain point, he replaced the hashish He became very wealthy. Fifty kilometers from Amsterdam, where the country's Vito Shukrula At 32 years old, He's familiar with the profile who were recruited by traffickers.

People are still afraid of him Yes it's normal, there are always contacts outside He is a very powerful person with a lot of money So you have to be very careful about what you say and what you do Because he will have you killed if necessary that wouldn't stop him from sleeping A few months after this interview, the Mocro Maffia attacked Prime Minister Mark Rutte that he was going to give of 430 million euros to help the police It was after this announcement that the police discovered had started to follow him.

It's hard to imagine this man in the 2000s. When they ask me Everything is inside in that time Also, I can say the pressure is exciting. Paul Meyer was the head He was paid by traffickers safely into the port of Antwerp. Twenty years of criminal life. I know people don't want to hear this. They want to see somebody who's saying But I'm honest, it was a beautiful time. It was really beautiful time. The product is not nice.

Next to the historic center of Antwerp, It is huge, Here you can see, Normally, you cannot drive here. Now you can see for yourself up to the boat. This is a big difference This is an open port. Unlike the port of Rotterdam, which is completely fenced off you can walk the length and breadth easily accessing container storage areas I told you, see it yourself. It's easy to drive here When they want to organize this, The wood. Now, 80 percent From countries like Brazil The wood comes mainly from Latin America, This type of cargo is therefore We were able to access For over half an hour, without anyone stopping us. This is a boat from South America. If you are clever, It's easy since you know Therefore, you either need people here Somebody puts the containers out, simple. It's not difficult. To get this information, it's sometimes enough to simply talk who are on the quay. -Hello. -Hi. Seemingly, a harmless conversation, but for a smuggler, It's in my language. However, you can see how easy He explained to me everything. He also gave me in the port Information is easy to get here. I only opened my window I didn't pay him for that information. Corruption in the port In 2021, the discovery of encrypted conversations revealed the extent of the scourge. Customs, police, shipping companies, the cocaine mafia has infiltrated Their main target, dockers. We went to the bars in the port With a hidden camera, I hear a lot about corruption, Are there people coming to you They try to have your name. When you don't cooperate with them, they threaten to do something It's a dangerous business. You'd rather stay out of the business. Once you are in, Do you know of people? Do you think it's possible -No. -I think you better not do that. Watch over what you're doing. The dockers know the risks These threats are so frequent made a prevention clip when working for the mafia. The clip features a smuggler The clip alerts the dockers. Once they get involved, For the traffickers, the dockers They're the ones Niels worked for ten years on the docks. Today, he's retired. My job was to lift containers I operated the mobile cranes, the big machines that take Usually, on a ship like this, the drugs are concentrated and the traffickers have to isolate it from the rest of the cargo Niels was approached several times A guy told to me that I had to put There was a time he said I lifted the container I said something is wrong here. If you agree with them, they own you, How much money I heard amounts from 10,000, 20,000 euros. First, you get the 20K, You still have to do it, More surprisingly, to bribe the dockworkers. They pay them in cocaine. Most of the young dockers because they are not able to do They use coke to be more fucked up The traffickers know that, They tell them if you do this, They make them addicted to coke that they can sell themselves or whatever. Do you think that we still can fight It's a war nobody can win. Nobody can win it. In Antwerp, some neighborhoods by drug trafficking. Cocaine arrives in such quantities A gram is the cheapest in Europe, Filip Dewinter has been a city councilor for more than 20 years.
