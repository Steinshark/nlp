Hey it's me, Destin. This... [KA-CHUNK, KA CHUNK] [JET ENGINE NOISES] [CHU-KUH, CHU-KUH] [KER-FLOP] [DING!] is at the Kodak The fact that we get to film in This is how Kodak And this is the third of three videos. In the first video, How did they make that stuff back there? We learned about films with Estar backing in taking these plastic pellets and then extruding it and then stretching it out And we learned about a concept called This is a clever arrangement of pulleys inside the production line the extrusion from the auger. This allows you to never stop the process you can stop a roll we took that wide roll that we made, coating to it I kid you not. It's incredible They're actually applying multiple layers and they make the layers, like in these And oh, by the way, And after they apply the coatings, like a mile of conveyance They're hardly touching this stuff In fact, they use these nineties It is a technological marvel. So at the end of video two, and these big light proof So at that point so that it's small enough We have to like, it's called slitting. We have to slit the film and then we have to put these little holes in it. are important for it So after we do that, we have to We're gonna get to see how they build the can And then after we put the film in that can, we have to put the whole thing And then we're going to see This process is incredible and Before we start, most important thing dealing with today already So we have to keep everything in the dark when a shutter is allowed to open By the way, I'm going to take film photos [click] so we get to see the [click] Kodak process Very cool. Anyway, let's get started. Patrick is a young engineer since he got out of school And he's going to walk us through Now, this process is amazing, right here at the Slitter Tim is the operator of the slitter [Tim] This is where we slit the film that comes in from coating in a wide role form 54 inches. This is all Dark It comes in to the cover lifter, cover lifter comes in, [Destin] So that would be the casket lifting the lid on the casket. [Destin] Oh, gotcha. [Tim] Once that's off we go and check the roll. And make sure we got the right roll. We'll hit some buttons. It automatically loads onto the slitter. This will slit 12,000 feet. So one of these large caskets And this slitter, we usually do the full roll 12,000 feet. per 35 millimeter roll. Is that right, Did I get that right? [Tim] yeah. All right. So this is Patrick. [Patrick] Nice to meet ya. [Tim] This is the unwind. So we put it on the unwind, thread it up. There'll be a leader in the machine. [Destin] Is this PET or is this acetate? This is Estar. [Destin] Okay, Estar. Got it. So you've got your two banks. You got your even and your odd bank. This is a 35 millimeter slitter only. [Destin] So you have tension on one side This is a whole sheet going. [Tim] Everything's got tension. [Destin] Everything's got tension? [Tim] Yeah. [Destin] They're spinning right now? Oh wow! So is this actually moving leader [Tim] No. [Destin] Okay. We just have tension. [Destin] So this is, this is idling here? [Patrick] I have clutches underneath those pullers [P] Yeah. [Destin] Gotcha. Okay, I'm with you. That's cool. So, you know, Tim, [Tim] more than anyone else. So is Tim, is Tim the guy? [Destin] So are you an engineer? What's your title? [Destin] I didn't mean to offend you So he's an engineer. Oh, yeah. [Destin] Yeah. That's how that works, isn't it? Like every manufacturing job the operators teach the engineers. That's the way it works. That's awesome. [Tim] So you've got, you know, that's the So this is basically the the odd bank, and then you got your salvage [Destin] Recycle? [Tim] Those are just waste. [Destin] And so you go get the silver out of that [Tim] Yes. Yeah, This is obviously [Destin] Okay. And that's where they knurled [Destin] So since this the slitting machine is so big, This is what we're looking at as a whole. We get a big roll of film unwinding It goes up and over and down half the film to the odd side and half of the film The edges are trimmed off and then sent So up until this process, you know, everybody's been worried But here it looks like I've got a roller. That is it So [Patrick] yup, yeah. So we touch the emulsion in this, only, mainly, Right. By the time wet emulsion, So we're, we're allowed to actually roll [Destin] So do you have night vision [Tim] Yes. [Destin] Okay. That's how you have to do it. [Tim] Yeah. Ummm I really don't use them. [Patrick] No [Tim] I've been working in the dark So, you can actually see fairly decent. I could see him in the dark, a K3 Slitter where they do that you know, the 135 that... You know, [Destin] So are we doing [Tim] it's 35 millimeter, but it's a different. [Patrick] Yeah. So this is [Destin] Oh okay. [Patrick] The sister slitter [Tim] It's the same exact [Tim] It's the same thing. [Destin] Got it. So question here, what is our final product We've got the big roll of estar coming in. We're slitting it. We're making our even in our odd What are we sending out of this room? Are we putting, [Time] Yes. Once the machine starts, you'll see So once they come under the rolls, And usually And once they're on there we'll they'll go out of the racking [Destin] Oh, am I seeing rails here? Yeah, it goes right in to that. [Patrick] We got a whole automated system. [Tim] All the handling system is automated, [Destin] So you're not past this point in the dark [Destin] Unless there's a problem. [Tim] So you want to see it, running? [Destin] Yeah. Yeah, It's great. If you don't mind? [Tim] Yeah. Okay, so now that's unrolling. [Patrick] Yup, yeah. So if you look through the window that you can actually see the web moving. [Destin] Okay, so it's actually going now, It's hard to see, but it's happening. Okay. Can I come over here? And then so now we're coming up [D] Okay. [P] And that's where we We've got our Web steer here in the middle, So this thing will actually move to keep the web centered. [D] So it's moving this way laterally. [P] Ah It actually does on a pivot. So it's feeding this way, right? So it's coming across. [D] uh huh [P] And that's actually going to be tough It's actually going to come down. [D] So I can see it [P] And then we will end up through the knife That's that's You really see right through this window the web actually coming Okay. And now once it's through the knives, it's ah going to go up to the rewinds. Now it's 35 millimeter. Right through the flanged rollers on to the core. And then we just saw the. [D] So is it spinning up on each side? [P] Yes. [D] Okay. I didn't realize that. So you're filling this side That's because we want to as soon as we can, So this is it right here, right? [Tim] Yeah. This is the product. [Tim] That's 500 feet. [Destin] Okay, So we fill 500 feet up, [Tim] I've got to get that film off. So in order to do that, do a splice. Now, normally in the dark and bring in another But since this is the because I'm So we're going to do a splice Again this is all in the dark. [Destin] Heh heh Wow. That's a vacuum? Is that a vacuum right there? [P] Yes. [Tim] There's vacuum upper and lower are vacuums. Yeah. [D] Okay. [Tim] So that's double sided splice tape. So you'll see when that goes back, it's The 500 feet rolls down. It'll be clear in a minute [Destin] Okay. Understood. So the splice is running You can actually go in when it comes down. You'll see these arms come up. You can hear the tape [Destin] Uh huh. Where's the splice at? [Tim] It's it's right over there. [Patrick] Just passed down now. It's going to go through the knives now. [D] I see it So you can see it? [Tim] The white is the adhesive for the tape. [Destin] I guess it's in the dark. So it doesn't matter. [film slaps down as arms make contact] So that just separated. All the, everything. You see what I mean now? [Tim] All these roles are stuck down. [Destin] Ohh, I see If we didn't do that splice. This is still attached to the roll. So how does it get out of the room? [Destin] So this is like a perforation. So the splice has the ability Is that true? [Tim] It's double sided. There's adhesive on both sides. So when it reverses, it [Destin] Got it. Okay I understand now. So basically, the splice is preemptively getting double sided [Patrick] Yes [Destin] Is that right? [Tim] You're using double sided [Destin] Got it. Okay, cool. That makes sense. Yeah. So you can see the confusion I said it all makes sense once you see it. [Destin giggling] Okay. [Tim] All right. So that's the same, same thing. We just make sure they're all stuck down. [Destin] And so can I. Can I free will this? And I should see it closed out on it. There it is. [Tim] Yeah. They all have them. They all have. All right. Here. Okay. Got them. So some the clutches [Tim] Yes. [Destin] Got it. And so now you're going to automatically [Tim] Yeah. [Destin] Okay. [Tim] Normally this cart moves out and this rack goes and then they go out of this room [Destin] Is this how they send back Yeah. There's another room next to us. The clock's all these [D] got it. [Destin] Dude you're good at this. [Tim Humbly] I don't know. Yeah, that's pretty legit. So you've got send these out? [Tim] Yup. [Machines spool up] [Air hissing as arms move down] [Click into place, then film flipping over rolls as it moves away] [Sounds of the shafts spinning] [Air hiss as the machine stopped] [Destin] And so it's going to go over? [Tim] No. That's where it's stopping film and throw it out But like I said, normally when you're in [Destin] And so this machine is all about managing [Tim] Yeah, tension is very important You lose tension. That's going to be film [Destin] Wow. Okay. It's a big deal. [Tim] All right. [Destin] Sweet. they had a huge assembly, And we had a brief discussion [Patrick] So we've got an upper and lower So we've got the upper knives up here. [Destin] Okay, Show me a knife. These are the knives? [Patrick] This is a knife. [D] So that's a [P] Yeah. So there is some geometry science we can't go into here. [P] Yes, right. So this is a shear cutter. [P] So we kind of use two different processes We've got shear straight through slitting, where we actually wrap around the [D] So it's coming in here and it's which also has a sharp edge [D] Goes around and goes out another way. And so it's actually making how many degrees of contact, [P] Let's say about 100, maybe less. [D] Okay. That's awesome. Thank you very much. This episode of Smarter And you've probably heard of VPNs But I want to tell you a story My grandfather used to have He had an old shirt and he would put this old shirt on. It had holes and it's He would put that shirt on before he went to buy a car because he didn't want the salesmen about what he could afford based on how There's a new way to use VPNs That's very similar to the trick You know that websites They know where you are in the world and Now, interestingly, They will change the price on hotel rooms and on like electronics I think this is interesting. This is a really cool use of a VPN. So instead of saying let's use Nord vpn to connect And you'll notice you will get different prices In the US, Microsoft Office is offered Makes sense, right? In Colombia, it's 77 bucks. That is a significant difference. Adobe Creative Cloud, in Colombia, it's offered for 198 bucks. Say what?!? What's going on here? I think this is amazing. And if you were to try this, you can get nordvpn That is the best deal So go check it out. You get a really good discount You also get four months for free. So Norton VPN dot com slash smarter. They have thousands of servers so you can check out the internet One thing I've always wondered about Yeah, you can. There's a button right there. One account lets So I have it on my phone, Nord vpn is super fast so you don't have to Go to nordvpn dot com slash smarter. Also, if you don't like it, If you try it and you don't like it, I'm grateful to Nord VPN for sponsoring this episode because So now that we've slit these big rolls of film down it's time to see one of the processes and that's putting these holes Mechanical cameras that line up with those holes, If they get it wrong, through the camera correctly We headed through a labyrinth of halls that does this. And I met Matt, So right now this room has lights on, [Matt] Yes, we work in a dark environment. So yeah, as you see, here's our booth. This is basically [Destin] And this is on curtains, [Matt] Yeah. So no light damages the film. [D] Okay. [Matt] It keeps the light content. [Destin] Sounds great. So what are we trying to do in this room? [Matt] So this is how the film comes in. That's just one piece of film. What we want is a finished product [Destin] Oh, okay, so we're punching holes. [Matt] This machine right here, [Destin] So this is this is what lets the camera [Matt] Exactly. That's where the the sprocket will grab the film [Destin] Oh, wow. Okay. [Matt] So yeah, we this is where based on the customers demand [Destin] Okay. So you can do different whole sizes and [Destin] Really. [Matt] So yeah. [Destin] So this is where you put the core over [Matt] Well, to be honest with you, what happens As you said, we're in a dark environment. This door would be open. There's an arm bring the roll [D] Okay. [M] Then this arm comes down. It puts all the computer information [D] How does how does the arm know [M] Well it downloads from the actual rack. [D] Okay, got it. [M] There's a card on the rack. [D] Got it. [M] That'll be read It's going to know 4000 foot or 6000 foot. [D] Okay. and it's also going to tell it [D] This looks very complicated. [M] That's just the nuts But for an operator's point of view, [D] Okay. [M] There's only a couple of interactions Everything else is automated. [D] Can you show me what they are? [M] Yeah. What I'm gonna do. So this is exactly how the roll would have So as an operator, because we don't want that. So this chopped it. And what we want is a rounded edge [D[ Okay, So a rounded edge [M] very specific cut [M] We don't want this going through the heart on the other end. [D] Okay. [M] Because of the chance [D] So that was a vacuum right there. [M] Yeah. holding it down [D] So, So you don't scratch it. [M] Exactly. [D] So on, on the roll, It's on the inside? And this is a support. [D] Okay. [M] The outside of the support. [M] So now I'd pull this knife off, I'd throw that out. [D] Okay. [M] And it keeps me from overlapping the film. So I butt that up to the knife. I'm going to reset it now. I take a piece of tape and you want it in the center of the film. You don't want it being perforated. [D] Okay. [M] So now I'm going to take this. [D] You don't want the tape to be perforated [M] It's very, It could be. Our tape could get stuck on the heart and There's a number of things [M] So now I'll take the slack out. and I'm going to send the film through. [D] Where should I be looking right now? [M] That's well all this, you got. This arm moving. The film is going to kick through this end and it's predetermined so this this board comes out the knife will cut the film so that I have all the tape Gotcha. And then this would be what we call Every roll that I would send to the tube system and the inspector will verify [D] Got it. So. So what this machine is [M] The scratchiest? [D] You said, Is that what you said? [M] Well, this is the verify. [D]Got it. [M] Yeah, because obviously the customer [D] Got it. [M] So this verifies that every single roll [D] Perfect. [M] There is no defects. [D] Gotcha. [M] And then we manually wrap it around [D] I'm going to put So we got tension on the roll. [D] You didn't you didn't tape it or anything. You just let the tension do the work. [M] Exactly. It'll wrap around itself, And now we got the door open [D] So stay back? [D] Got it. [M] So now I'm going to start the machine. [D] All right, So. [M] So this is It's going to unwind from the backend [D] Okay, Sounds good. [Machine starts up] [Destin] Got it. [Whirrling sounds as it speeds up] That's really fast Matt. [D] That's really fast. We used to run 100 [D] So this really increased productivity. [M] Yeah, Greatly. Greatly. We've been doing it this way 25 years [D] Did you run it on 100 feet per minute system? [M] I still do, some products. We still have to run that way. [D] Can you show me [M] Oh, you mean the perforation? [D] Where is it? Where is it punching the holes? [M] This right here. So this is the actual punch drum [D] Okay. [M] So as it rotates it's pushing the perforations [D] I see it right here. [D] So those are the little posts [M] punching, punching the [D] Yeah. [M] And the film that's ejected goes into the heart Through this exhaust tube. [D] So. So if I had a high speed camera, I would [M] Yeah. Is this is clear. Yeah. You'd see the vacuum [D] Is there a bucket of those holes somewhere? [M] Right around the wall [D] Okay. [M] There's a big bin. [D] Sounds good. So can you. Can you run this? So we're done. [M] Yeah. [D] We slurped like a spaghetti noodle. We slurped the end of the film up [D] Okay, so that that roll is done. So at this point, [M] Now, if this was actual production I wouldn't. What would happen is, this arm right here. [M] This arm comes down. It takes the empty core, comes back While that's going on the manipulator arm is bringing in my next [D] That's awesome. [M] So, yeah, I don't. [D] Gotcha. [M] It's all automatic. [D] So what on this machine Is there something [M] Uh, not usually. [D] That's impressive. [M] There's, you might get an unusual but they're they're very reliable. [D] That's impressive. So how many of these do you guys have? [M] We have these two here, [D] Seven on the other side. Yeah, we used to have 28, as it used to be, [D] it's picking back up. [M] No, I love it. I love it. [D] Do you like your job? [M] Oh, I love it. I love, I started 26 years ago all the changes we've gone through, [D] Yeah. [M] A lot of us never anticipated that [D] Are you seeing production go up? [M] Yeah, it seems to be headed that way. Cause we were, actually been working We hear about all the directors That still love film. [D] I still shoot film. [M] Yeah, no friends of mine. Same thing that when you go upstairs and I'm a big music fan so I still got [D] Oh yeah, isn't it awesome? [D] I love it. doesn't mean it's improved. Can you show me the holes that come out of the [M] Yeah, I'll show you right here. So what happens is, of seven, all the perfs get sucked [M] And we have these two big hoppers right [M] And this is where they get dispensed, [D] Oh, wow. [M] Yeah. [D] Dude! [M] So that's. That's how much film we've run. [D] That's amazing. [M] All of it. All those little perforations. There's silver in that. [M] Exactly. So we recycle it to recover the silver. [D] So once it comes out here, So this is you just. Can I get a picture with you in there, [Matt] Oh, sure. [Patrick] So I'm sure he told you, right? That middle bit We call that the heart, right? [D] No, he didn't tell me that. [P] Okay, So. [D] So so he seemed to not have a big concern which tells me that the engineers [P] Yeah, there is a lot of technology That system right, 3000 feet a minute. It is not, not slow There's a lot of extra things that [P] I mean, when you're up at 3000 feet now. [D] Yes. [P] Right, vibrations, harmonics, Tensions are really important. So we're actually sneaking through because we've got a lot of the hearts And here's one kind of, kind of cut open. Oh yeah. [P] So, and just this little bit is sticking out. [D] Okay [P] and we've got all the hoses and stuff hooked up to the front here And one reason why we nickname it the heart, [P] And when it's running, it's like a heart one. [D] Those are just straight involute teeth, [D] That's interesting. So can I sit down in this chair? [P] Yes. [D] And kind of engage with this. [P] This is really, really high [D] Okay, so I'm seeing. So you've got set screws here. [P] Yes. [D] That are positioning each individual [P] Yeah. So the lower sets, And up at the top is the punches, right. So we've got a punch and die operation [D] You think so? [P] Yes. So I grab it here. Okay. That's a free wheeler, Yeah. Look at that. Okay, so. So this is just a one to one. [P] Yup [D] I feel no mechanical interaction yeah so it's actually a through hole. [D] So basically here's my knife. So this hole has to move left in order to index with the punch And is there, do you know how many [D] There's 96. And so those are paired. [P] Yep. [D] And they're tuned as a pair. [P] Correct. [D] How long does it take to tune them? [P] Months. [D] Months to tune one heart? [D] Are you serious? [P] Yes. [D] Well, Um, How is it driven? There's a big motor out this way. [P] Yep, Yep. So got a serve on the serve on the. [D] Direct drive? [P] Direct drive. [D] Yeah. That's incredible. I'm noticing the the slots on the inside. So you have a channel [P] Yup [D] So you have maximized your vacuum surface you actually distribute that vacuum and that is a precisely machined part. [D] So that's, that's a monolithic piece, That ring [P] Uh, every single die there is individual [P] But the vacuum chamber is Right on the drum. Yeah. [D] So so there's how many [Patrick] Alright. So you get the die drum which is the, to with the vacuum channels. And then you've got the all 96 around [D] Then you have the vacuum [P] Yeah. But that's right on the, finish of that is very important [P] Correct. [P] Yup. [D] Okay. So where do the perforations go after they get punched into the holes, How do they get extracted? [P] You see these [D] Yeah. [P] That bringing light through there, Right. Right to the center hub here and pull out all the [D] It comes this way. [P] Yep. Okay. And that's that little hose that was on That's amazing. So do you ever have jams in here? Because if you get. Because if this thing's running super, if it gets on one side and you get a clump of them, It'll sling it in there [P] Yeah, yeah. So you can't put more in the hole [D] Okay. And so then it gets imbalanced now. So that's where the harmonics come in. I'm struggling to express Like if you've ever designed anything, the dies and make this thing run at 3000 Like, you have to make sure that you And there's hundreds of pieces This is very complicated. So what is this? [P] So you'll be able to look through You can't film through the microscope. So you actually be able to see up When you look through here, [P] Look through the die up, up at [P] So you've got to being worked on so you can give it a little [D] Oh, wow. So you're looking at the edges. [P]Yeah. So that that's how you're you're kind of going to use this tool Right, Because you really want to be looking at that alignment Because having it touch is really, [D] Okay. So you're looking [P] Yeah, we're looking up through the die [D] Got it. [P] Where they're interacting. [D] So you're rocking that back And you can throw this [P] Yeah. You're going want to look at the front, [D] Okay, so. [P] Front punches back punches. [D] Oh wow. So he's actually got Oh wow. So there's some teeth [D] Or punch excuse me, and so they're setting those [P] Oh, yeah. [D] That's so cool. Everything's a special tool. That's amazing. Oh, and these are the fiber lights. I use these for schlieren. Okay. Just to see what's going on. So what's what's happening here is someone who's working on We've got the vacuum ring still there, and that's on the non photo [P] Correct. [D] The backside of the film. And so they're going through one These threaded holes. They are putting they are putting perf holes in. Is that what they're doing? [P] Dies. [D] The die. Excuse me. So that's So they're putting those dies in one Man. I'm just, This part has 96 sets of four threaded holes. So to kill that part is expensive. That's a oh, that part right there [P] Oh, yeah. [D] That's amazing. These are all hearts. [P] These are all hearts. [D] Okay. And if one part on the heart, I'm estimating it tens and you have multiple parts and then you have all of these little I'm post, what do you call the post again? [P] Punches. [D] Punches. And then the dies. [P] Carbide dies. Okay, So this this room represents That's incredible. Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. So we cut the film, we put holes in it. Now we get to put it in this little can, which is more complicated [P] You get these large metal printed on it. [D] And they've already [P] Yeah. [D] So that the camera can read the ISO, The man in charge of cutting these things up is Donovan. I'm Destin again, so [Don] Sure. [D] Is that cool? [Don] That's great. Donovan, down the strips, Wow, That's fast. [Metal clanking] [The metal material hitting the end of the conveyor belt stop] So you visually inspect every single wow. [Don] Yeah. [D] Every single strip That's legit. [Don] So now you flip it like this and you look down, [Metal sliding across the table] [Destin] your brain is doing [Don] Well, the more you do it [Metal scraping across table top] this is a matte finish. It's a matte back. Silver will reflecting in your eyes. [D] Yeah. We then walked around the corner that was making the little metal So you're taking this metal at this point [Don] Right. [Don] Yes, it does. [Metal clanking as the strips are pulled through] [Dies punching metal] [Metal caps moving on belt, So do you remember those long strips Well, it's time to get those ready And one thing you'll notice is right there's a little bit of velvet The machine that normally does but Patrick showed us how it would work [P] So we're bringing the strips the metal slitter there And we're doing all the crimp edges [D] Yeah. [P] And then we're also cutting it out, right, Because we've got to stick [D] How do you do that [P] Very carefully. Got it. So we're we're bending [P] Yeah. [D] And that's feeding along this way? Right. [D] So we put a hopper in down there And then we start [D] Oh really. [P] This is actually happening upside down. [D] Okay. [P] So we're, then we start putting the velvet on. So. So we're uh its We're heating it [D] Okay, What is the velvet come? Is it like a big roll up? [P] So you'll see here. [D] This is the velvet? So we unwind it and we come through. We've got another accumulator here. [D] Oh, that's a velvet accumulator. [D] Oh that's, that's cool. I like that. So accumulates [P] Correct. [D] Yeah it just kinda pushes it and then so we are glued it onto the strip here, goes through some heaters Right. we don't want the velvet connected because we got to cut it, [D] It comes this way I can fill that. [P] Yeah. [D] Oh that's, that is so strange. [P] And then now since the velvets cut, to where we're just cutting the metal. So we're actually we're and then they'll be indexed [P] And that's one of those trays. We have some loaded ones over there. [D] Okay. [P] And that's what to actually form this [D] So we're gonna turn this into [D] Down the hall cut and crimped, they're being loaded into one of This is what actually makes the can. Let's watch it for a second, and then [Metal scraping, click sound every rotation] [Metal tubes clicking together as they fall from the belt] Okay, So metal comes out here, goes down, comes [P] Yeah. [D] It moves over here. It grabs a cap. And then as it moves forward, [P] Yeah. [D] And then it, it's crimps it on and then towards the back it stakes it. Is that right. Yeah. [P] So this is the stacker here. So once it brings the cap over, and then the rest of it So taking it off, deciding cause we're measuring how well [D] Got it. [Machine sounds once again] [Hollow metal tubes clicking together as they drop] So good. It's so good, dude. It's so cool. Okay, We've made the film It's open on one side. We've only staked it on one side, and then we have to put it How do we do that? First all, we get the other side of the can In a vibration rotation thing And then check this out. The little plastic canisters, just by that little lip on the top, I could watch this for days. The lids for those cans move up this little conveyor belt if the lid is oriented If it's not, it kicks it out. Once all these components are oriented a light lock into the adjacent room in one complete package in a 35 millimeter So you're Sermin? [D] Nice to meet you. [S] Nice to meet you too. [S] Yes, I do. [S] Okay, so this is the A cabinet. [D] Okay. [S] So we hang the rolls like this. That's all ready [D] Is that a B cabinet? You have two? [S] Yes, we have two, [D] And so you can have two rolls on there [D] Auto splice. [Machine hissing air] [D] Oh, I'm seeing these film caps. [S] Oh, yeah. [D] Okay. So I'm seeing all the components. [P] Yeah. [Patrick] They all come together here. [S] That's the magazine. [D] Got it. So you're running Kodak Gold today? And the caps are coming right there. [D] So these are the lids? [S] No, those are the end caps. [D] Oh, I see. Yeah. So [S] These are the lid. [D] Can I show you the one from my pocket? Can you show me where the things are? [S] Okay, so these two, this one happens [S] And this one happens. Will come down here. [D] Okay, so this one here, this end cap right [S] Right. [D] And then the whole can, is right here. [S] Right [D] And they come down here to meet. [Destin] Okay. And then there's a can right here. [D] All right, so there's the can. [D] And so we're going to end up with one [S] Right. And then the lid is coming down this. [Destin] Got it. Oh, look at that. They're at right angles [D] So as it moves, it just kind of flops [D] Oh, that's neat! [Patrick] So this is actually shinning light and actually putting on that latent image and other information [Destin] You can't see it on this, [P] correct So this is the thing that says [D] So this, this right here [Patrick] Yup. [Destin] Interesting. How does it know where to start and stop? It's got to be reading the belt too. [Patrick] Yeah. So we read the belt, So we know how many frames have gone by, and then we can quickly zip when we're starting the new one so this machine can run continuously We can line it all up when it finishes the other cabinet So the spooler never actually stops even though you got to stop So and so when the film comes in here, [Patrick] Then it's coming up. And we've got this vacuum slack box [D] Right here? [D] Go ahead Sermin. [D] So the film comes in, goes up, down.. [Patrick] And that's that's a vacuum box. So there's actually the film in a loop. and stopping a whole bunch, but You can't really be starting [D] Oh, okay so,[D] so those have to move at a constant [D] And then you, you [P] Inside is the accumulator. and so this opens up [Sermin] Umm, this is the exposure We can set up for 36 or 24 or whatever [Destin] Right. [Sermin] And also here too. [Destin] So you have an accumulator here. [Sermin] Yeah. That's the big box on the left here. [Destin] Okay. That's an accumulator. This is the exposure setting [S] Yup And I'm seeing I'm, I'm [Patrick] That is right in front of you. That's the stuff that punch and die that leader pattern. [Destin] So on the leader, on the film, right there, I'm seeing it like this. [Sermin] Yeah. [Destin] So that's where it's cut. And then it goes there and Yeah, sounds good. So these are the leftovers. Okay. Gotcha. And so where does that go? [Patrick] Goes up into that second exposure box [Destin] Uh huh. [Patrick] So you got the nice, you got a web path here. I don't know if that's helpful? Okay, so is this, this is one roll of 36, [Destin] Gotcha. Okay. [Patrick] And then we're coming So this rotor here, this is doing all that we're actually going to be doing all the combinations And we're putting all the parts together. [Destin] So Patrick then explains the machine I think we would benefit and then we'll talk about It all starts when a piece of tape that's going to be [whirring, click, clank, clunk] And in the next position, the film is taped to the center spool and then it's cut. [Rhythmic Click Clack] The can that we made earlier is then slid I know it's hard to see, is put on making the whole thing This little rocker arm drops a full can of and as the whole line advances to pop on the top, and it's pushed down So tell me where it goes. so we just put it in the can and now Up and around with air. [P] Yup, down, down through this tube [Destin] So right here. [P] It goes up over the spooler and out into the white line [Destin] Thank you very much. [Sermin] You're very welcome. So after the film can let's Can it all goes through a tube back And I met a very special person of the final packaging process. And basically what we do here as it exits the spooler through that tube. [D] Okay. [R] In which case then it comes around here Packaging lives and it's formally packaged We run singles, hang tab, packages, we run five packs, three packs, two packs, several different options, in which case after it comes out of 3P, every different station on it. We have a 12 minute continuously running. They all do something different When it comes out on the table, and packaging individual or check the carton And with that box right here with the label saying how many of those particular packages The case After that it goes down [Destin] So he's over there ready for it, right? [R] That's correct. You'll see the cartons come in right here. We manually put them on suction cups that pulls [R] Yes. Right here in this position, number two, what we do is You can probably see [D] Okay? Like right this? [R] Sneak right in. Okay. And that little bottom kicker arm flap upwards [D] oh, so this this thing right here [R] Right, Right. The bottom flap only. And then this, this bar right here forms the other bar to be like this. [D] Okay, but the right side [R] It does the rail takes it and [D] Gotcha. [R] At this point, what we're doing we're running five pack right now, so it'll load five spools right down into the carton. [D] Oh, okay, so this is our tube right here. Can I can I get where you're at? [R] That's the tube coming out of the spooler. [D] So this is the tube coming out of the And what do you call this? This swing arm [R] Actually, [Patrick] Just a rotary actuator, [D] right, right there? [P] Yeah. [D] Okay. So it's grabbin, am I in a light screen? [Destin] Okay. [Rhythmic clickety clack] Oh, I love the way this sounds. [R] Yeah. [D] And so it's dropping and counting. [Patrick] Yeah. [R] It is five. It's looking for five. But the program within the machine. The machine logic loads in that first server, [D] Got it. Excuse me. At this point, we come over here, [D] Ahhh. It's the outside of our 35 millimeter These metal detectors are looking for five So it's important that the can is ferrous [R] Right, right. So, you know, because we won't never miss. If it does have less than five, to come to this station and remove it, there could be four or three, After that we have basically this top kicker, kicker right there that bends to the flap [D] Okay. [R] Okay. [R] Oh, absolutely. So same same situation. We're actively closing the left side [R] right, the right side the rail will close, and at the same time, it'll fast print the emulsion number on this particular carton, [D] So you're saying the the emulsion number is being printed [Rich] Well, actually, right here [D] You can see it. [R] There's your emulsion number [D] So is this being glued in position? [R] It will. At the very next station. Okay. All your flaps will be tucked you'll get a shot of glue on the top tab, and a shot of glue on the bottom tab. [D] It's happening top and bottom there? [R] Right, right, right. [D] Oh I see it. [R] right here, right in this area. And here [R] Okay. [D] Oh, okay, [R] As soon as it comes by Is it will shoot just a little [D] Gotcha [R] Okay, at that point. These rails here will just compress it [Destin] Oh, okay. Just mechanically constraining it. [R] Yes. Right here, this station surface. [D] And so so I can imagine [R] Exactly, right. And we have several 3P So they're all set up for different units or configurations, as we call it. Okay. After that's held here it'll then come over here Once again, it has lights on the top there to make sure that the flap because we don't want one of those at that point, it's ejected It grabs the unit carton and you can see it slides right down and our packaging operator once again and puts it in the box. [D] So do the [Op] Umm, not really it depends on the table [inaudible] [Op] So they are really smooth. [D] So you send that, that way it gets taped, Man you get to see stuff That's pretty cool. [D] So do you stay here all day [Destin] Everybody rotates. So what do you do here? I will watch that cable for you. So here and we always make sure the labels on the corners [D] So how long have you been working here [Op2] Four months, [Destin] You like it? [Op2] Yes, I like it, it's something different. I worked at a bunch of different packaging So, it's something different. Everyone here works together. It's a very good team project. You said you were the youngest guy here, [D] Are you hoping to work, work your way up? [Op2] Yeah, that's it. Yeah. Everyone here keeps saying [Destin Laughs at the joke] [D] Yeah? [Op2] Yeah. [Destin] Nice to meet you. [Op2] Nice to meet you too. [Sermin] 45 Years! [D] 45 years? You're running away, man! So you got 45 years here? [Op3] 43. [D] Are they good years? [D]You like, like working with everybody here? [Destin] Yeah? What are you working on right now? [Op3] This machine here [Op3] No, it's down right now. [Op3] Well maintenance Awesome. Nice What's your name? [Op3] David. [Op3] You too. [D] Awesome. I could tell that you, [Op3] She's known me a longggg time. [D] So ya'll are like family? [Ops] Yeah, yeah... I would say we are. [Destin] That's awesome. Okay, so if you've stuck with me in Rochester, New York, I'll tell you how it made me feel. I feel like these people are a family, people are making things together It's the strength You've got the older generation and the younger generation and they're learning and they're getting it done. And it makes me feel really, really good. So there's one obvious thing left to do, But as you watch this happen, We've made the backing. We put the light sensitive and we've seen how they slit it It's an incredible process. It's a marvel of engineering. So I want to say thank you to you and thank you to everybody that's support It's a really big deal. Thank you for helping And thank you to everybody at Kodak So with that being said, and let's do what I think you are So Rich. [Rich] Yes. I've got a camera with me. I want to get a roll of film off the line [R] Okay. [D] Can I do that? [D] Okay, so. [R] You're winging it. [D] I'm winging it, man. All right, so we got a camera here ready to do this. I'm excited about this, Rich. [Rich] First of all, you would take this off. This is a little bit irregular. I'm used to using a Kodak cameo. Easy shoot, this one. I see you have to direct the leader and, and set your ISO setting. In this case, It's got the. [R] Oh, you do have barcode reader. [D] Yeah. [R] Okay. I'm not used this camera. [D] Oh yeah. Can I get a picture of you guys? [D] Can I get a picture of you guys together? We're a team. We're all on the same team. [D] All right here we go ready. Get some muscles. [Rich] Oh, come on. [Inaudible joking and laughter] [Inaudible joking and laughter again] [Laughter again!] Nice to meet you guys, up top! [Destin] That is awesome, that's great. I'm gonna get one of you guys too, right here. One, Two, Three [Shutter Click] this is so good and fun, Rich man. It's nice to meet you dude. [Rich] Destin, it was nice to meet you too. Yeah, I'm And I hope you got some detailed explanation around the 35 millimeter process. I hope you enjoyed this. Please And I love making videos like this. If you want to support, slash smarter every day. Or you can sign up for the email list That's a really good way to figure out Anyway, that's it. I'm grateful Have a good one. Bye.
