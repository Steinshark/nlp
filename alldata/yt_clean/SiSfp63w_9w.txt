Did you ever want to like you can do on a Well, with the Hi and welcome back. Today we have a We have the Osmose from Expressive E. The Osmose is a true learn all you need to And of course you're So let's take the tour. [Music] Right, so I first discovered And I was introduced to this And of course I And I just had to have Right, so first let's clarify. The Osmose synth is It has its own unique sound onion called the Egan Matrix, So you don't need a You can just hook up your headphones and play this instrument So what's the innovation and Well, on the ordinary keyboard, except I like your ordinary When you strike a key, you And depending on the velocity you But with the Osmos technology for the keypad There's actually a website which shows how So we can see there's a three axis So we have pressure top to the bottom, so And you can drag the Now if you ever watched the Dune called &quot;Corridor&quot;, which [Music] So with the Osmose we can basically the pitchband So we can do a very fun pitch bending. [Music] So we can basically create the And I gotta say unlike any other expressive when and really begin [Music] [Music] And there's also more expressions notes. You can [Music] And then you can also another sound with many of [Music] Now it's hard to recognize that this a different kind of style. [Music] And secondly we're leaning. And it takes a of the patches to this sideways. or X axis pitch bend. So you have to be practice a little with the pitch But as long as you same time, it's quite Because if you're be a little bit which of your sideways and adjusting [Music] Let's try some more [Music] Dual cello. [Music] So I like this bending and wiggling You also have the regular mod wheel. [Music] On this specific sound it controls... some kind of overtones. And you also have pitch bend, which is on this patch. [Music] [Music] Now there is on-board effects on but you can only have Now this patch 80 Neon [Music] But you can always go into the and increase the mix [Music] Let's decrease the [Music] So that's just the built-in reverb Now the electric key is 6. Let's go and modify Maybe we can... So there's a whole reward by default. Maybe let's change The analog echo effect can add a a little bit of grit [music] Let's try the swept echo. [music] It starts more over Let's increase the feedback. [music] So the effects all in all has a And of course, as I showed you, we if we want to change them a little bit. But we can only So in this synth we first have the macro to easily control and modify the sound. [MUSIC PLAYING] Then there's, of course, more options if we use the lower knob Then the second page, And on the Osmose Dist There's a swept echo and an Low pass echo, high pass echo. Then on the second page, And we have a compressor and And finally, the mod or pedal page, where we can change the assignment of There's two pedal [MUSIC PLAYING] OK, so up till now, we've been the Eigen matrix, to create the sounds. But how about we try out with a DAW and some plugins? So first, we obviously need to to our computer. It's important to point out that controller or as a classic of DAW and the plugin And you can change that on external midi settings page. Here, you can change poly aftertouch, and multi-channel. But let's set it to MPE. And now, we can Next up, we can open the which is set to a filter cutoff. And the aftertouch how you press down the keys on the Osmos, so we can see that [MUSIC PLAYING] Now, it's also important to within Logic Pro is But the retro synth, the quick is compatible with the MPE. But in my current version of OK, so if we load up a we can actually see the with a little device in the plugin. [MUSIC PLAYING] And this also works Yes, as you can creating intricate So if you want to and maybe more talks on MPE capabilities, please let me know in the comments.
