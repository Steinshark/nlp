welcome today we are going to do and discuss an important topic which is creating some networks and subnetting and subnet masks in cisco packet tracer we are going to create a network and we are going to be dividing the network into subnets and we would assign ip addresses and subnet mask but before uh doing that we should know what an ip address is where and what actually a subnet and a subnet mask is so for that purpose here um i have given uh the journal format of an ip address basically uh an ip dress is divided into multiple classes which are class a from class a to class e and uh the class a as you can see the first eight bits basically represent um uh the network and the remaining uh um 24 bits they are for hosts so uh with that you have come to know that an ip address is usually of 32 bits and the first bit it's uh 8 bits are for network and in class a the very first bit is reserved and the remaining 7 bits are for network and 24 are for host for class b first two bits uh they are uh reserved and 14 bits are for a host network and the remaining 16 bits are for host so you should keep in mind that these first two bits they are reserved then in class c we have three bits are reserved and then we have 21 bits for network and only eight bits represent the hosts so these first network b bits means that the they differentiate one network from another for example the network of one country may have this uh address different and the other country may have this address assigned differently so uh basically to distinguish between networks um this address is uh designated class d and e are rarely used and that's why i'm not going to uh discuss them here now let's uh see um these are the advice formats as i've already discussed that um it is divided into basically four parts of 88 bits so it makes it 32 bit long and it is a global internet address every host every system um on the internet or on any network is basically um identified with the help of an ip address and ip stand for stands for internet protocol so you should keep in mind um that each source and destination have addresses uh which are known as ip addresses and um they basically are used to identify another network and the host as well so uh why these networks are divided into classes definitely uh these classes are for certain purpose for class a when we have few networks and within that network we have many hosts so we are going to use class a when we have a medium-sized network we are going to um use class b and when we have many networks and each network has many hosts then we are going to use a class c so this is generally the purpose of these different classes and then uh we are going to um see that how uh these class a b and c addresses are assigned um class a address time starts with a zero and the network uh with the first octet of zero and the and 27 are reserved it means that um zero and the last uh one two seven uh number a bit it is reserved so we have a potential of 126 addresses or you can say bits that are available for use okay so here uh all zero zeroed means that the first bit uh the zeroth one which is reserved and when we can use the remaining a one and one two seven which makes zero one 1 1 1 1 1 1 so uh you must now know the purpose of this one to seven because we and we have um um eight bits so the maximum uh can be one two eight but it because it starts from zero so from zero to 127 we can have in one octet octet means eight bits so uh the first zero all zeros they are reserved and the last um bit 1 1 1 127.011 1 it's also reserved so we could use uh from 1 to 126 these can be allocated in class a for class b it starts with 1 0 and the range in class b is from 128 to 191 which is binary one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero to one zero triple one triple one so uh the second octet is also the part of class b addresses so um there are two rest to par 14 uh addresses that we have which is equal to 16 384 now um this is why we have 14 because the first two bits are reserved as i told you that the first two octets are for class b so first to octet means that 16 bits are for network in class b but first two are reserved so 16 minus 2 is equal to 14 so we have a total of 2 raised to the power 14 16 384 addresses can be assigned in class b so we have we can have these much hosts for class we see it starts with one one zero and we would have a total of two raised to the power 21. now how this 21 comes as i told you that for class c the first three octets are reserved for networks so first 3 octet means 8 multiplied by 3 is equal to 24 because the first 3 are reserved so it's going to be 24 minus 321 so 2 raised to about 21 is equal to um you have 20 lakhs 97 152 addresses that can be allocated in class c so this is how these classes vary and then we are going to talk about a subnet basically subnet is where we divide a network into multiple sub networks so the way i p addresses are constructed made makes it relatively simple for internet uh routers to find the right route or network to root data into but as you can see for example in class a there could be millions of connected devices and um it could take some time for the data to find the right device right so for that purpose what we do is we use subnetting so subnetting basically narrows down the ip address to you to usage within the range of devices like we are going to divide a particular um particular range of ip addresses into uh sub networks so uh that we know that this particular range of ip addresses is for a small network say this network this range of the next range of ip addresses or is for this next network and so on so instead of routing uh throughout the network for found defining that particular device we know that this range of itb address would be located here so it the router will directly come here so that's the purpose of using uh sub here uh we are going to see uh discuss more about subnets in subnet mask so uh basically for the rest of the internet uh the site looks like a single network but inside the network we have divided the site into sub nets and each subnet is given a certain number which is known as a subnet mask so the host portion of the ip address it is partitioned into sub network some small networks so the uh globally um this network appears to be as a single network but the local routers route within the subnetted network so a subnet mask basically indicates uh that of which some network we are going to address or for which sub network um the data is destined for so uh subject mask basically uh tells that which network we want to route the data to so next we are going to see um it's an example um and next we have subnets and subnet mask so so to actually implement subnetting um in cisco packet tracer we must first know that how we can calculate a subnet mask uh for that purpose we are going to take an example uh say uh we take an example of a university right uh that university say the university has four blocks the i.t block science block arts blog and the post graduate block so say in it department or it block we need 136 hosts or we have 136 systems in science block we have 95 um systems hosts or users or devices in our's block we have 51 hosts and in pg our postgraduate block we have 24 hosts so here we are going to assume that the original ipa address that has been assigned to this complete network is 192.168.1.0 so after that we are going to this one two four eight sixteen thirty two sixty four one two eight two five six this is why i have written here this means two raised to the power zero one two raised to the power one two two raised to power two four raise to the power 4 8 2 raise to power 5 16 and so on so this is i have written for reference which um you people will see so we are first going to take the scenario of the it block in it block we need 136 hosts so uh always you should remember that ip addresses are assigned in the power of two right so 136 means that we would have to use this 256 because if we uh use this power of 2 which is 2 raise to power 2 raise to pass 7 so it won't be enough for us so we would have to go to 2 raise to power 8 that is 256 addresses so here sometimes happens that some ip addresses go wasted but this is the rule that ip addresses are assigned the total number of ip addresses are assigned in the power of two so we would have to use this because we have 136 hosts 128 is less than 136 we cannot use this so we would have to use this 2 raised to the power 8 is equal to 256 um ip addresses the total bits of ip addresses is 32 this is in journal as i've told you that an ip addresses has eight octets four octets um and octet means eight so eight fours are 32. so uh 32 minus eight why i'm subtracting 8 because i have this power of 8 this is the formula this is the way you calculate a subnet mask or a sub net number so we are going to subtract 32 uh by um eight and the answer is 24 thus the subnet mask has 24 bits so this answer is 24 and our subnet mask would have 24 bits and we represent a subnet mask like this 192.168.1.0 24. so 1.0 is the actual ip address that we had in hand which we are going to divide into sub networks so here our ip address is 1.0 now actually what would be the um subnet mask here subnet mask is 24 which means that we will have 24 bits which will be 1 and the remaining bits will be 0 so 8 16 32 all bits sorry 8 16 24 all bits are 1 the remaining are 0 so when you calculate this it becomes two five five this all ones become two five five this third one octet becomes two five five and this is all zero so this is zero does the subnet mask in dotted decimal location in notation this is binary notation this is called dotted decimal location notation is 255.255.255.0. so in journal we would write it like this in the form of an ip address but the actual subnet mask is this usually by default this is the subnet mask and the range of ip address that we can use is 192.168.1.1 because 1.0 i told you this is the starting one we cannot use the zero it will range from one dot one to one dot two five four y two five four because zero this zero means that uh we had actually here 256 number of um what do you say ip addresses but zero is reserved and the last one is reserved the two so 256 minus 2 becomes 254. so this is the range of ipip addresses that we can assign to the system in it block here now we are going to talk about uh the science block it needs 95 hosts a total of 95 hosts so here we are going to see the powers of a 2 so 95 means that we would have to use this 128 because the 64 is less than 95 so we would have to jump to 128. so 2 raised to by 7 is equal to 128 total bits of ip addresses as you all know is 32 so 32 minus 7 is equal to 24 thus the subnet mask would look like this 192.168.2.0 now 25. now you must be noticing that it is here the actual ip address is 1.0 here also 1.0 but you can see that all 255 addresses of this range have been utilized so i cannot go further that now i cannot use the same 1.0 here in this network because there is no range in the last octet there is no ip address that is remaining so what we are going to use we are going to use this 192.168.2 range now we are going to start with two first it was one the after one the last octet all octet is filled because it has a range of 256 and it is all occupied thus we are going to switch now instead of 1 we are going to write here 2 and it will start with the 0 2.0 so 25 bits now i want to know what the subnet mask would be so as this answer is 25 so the 25 bits will be one so the first octet is one the second octet is one the third octet is one it means 24 ones and then we have 25th one and the all remaining would be zero so this all once becomes two five five in binary these all ones in binary becomes two five five in decimal this all becomes two five five in decimal and this one triple zero triple zero zero is equal to 128 in decimal thus this is our subnet mask and the range of ip addresses that i can use is obviously this is zero this is reserved so i will start from one and as you can see the maximum range is one two eight but the last uh ip address is uh reserved so zero is reserved the last is reserved 128 minus two is equal to 126 so this is the range of ip addresses that can be used for science block and can be assigned you should notice that we have assigned only the range from 1 to 126 and the maximum was 1 two eight so in this block of addresses we still have some ip addresses left because here we reached a range of 256 but here we have assigned only 128 addresses so we have still some addresses left so let's see how we are going to assign addresses to the next block the arts block requires 51 hosts so let's see where it will stand 51 for 51. we cannot assign 32 because 32 is less than 51 we would have to go here 64. so 2 raised to past 6 is equal to 64. the ip address has total bits of 32 32 minus this these six bits is equal to 26 thus the subnet uh sorry this is 24 32 minus 6 is equal to 26 so the subnet mask has actually 26 bits this is i have written here wrong so the ip address would look like 192.168.2.0 here we will uh not have um what do you say one so this is another mistake we are going to be using two because one is already reserved 2.0 slash 26 and then uh we have the ip address of 192.168.2.128. why i have written this because uh the maximum ip addresses that we could assign was one two eight so we are now going to start from after one to eight so we have this ip address dot 2.128 so 26 bits would be one in our subnet mask so these are ones these are ones these are ones these are 24 ones 25 26 26 ones and remaining all zeros so it becomes 255.255.255. and this number in binary becomes 192 in decimal and the range of ip addresses that we can use is 92.168.2.129 because we are going to start from the next ip address and the last i preview address would be 190 why because we are simply what we are uh going to do here the way we did here the maximum was one two eight so we are simply going from 129 to 190 and this is the maximum address that we can assign 22 is the maximum that we can go but we are going to skip this 128 and the last one so 192 minus 2 would become 190 so this is the maximum range so uh let's now uh move on to our next uh block and which is going to be the pg block which needs 24 hosts so you should now see that still here it is gone up till 190 and we can actually go to 254 so we still have a lot of ip addresses left more than 24 hosts left that we can assign uh after this range so we are going to use we are not going to convert this two to three this can be used again so the maximum uh assigned was 192. and let's see uh for uh block uh pg block we have 24 hosts so for 24 we can maximum go to here 32 because 16 is less than 24 then we have 32 and 32 becomes 2 raised to the power 5 okay so the total range of ip addresses bits and i periodic is 32 32 minus this 5 becomes 27 thus the subject mask would have 27 bits and it would look like something like this 192.168.2.0.27 and the ip address that we have is 192.168.2.192 because this was the maximum here 192. the same way we have this this maximum of one to eight so we write the ip address one two eight here so this was the maximum we are going to start after this so here we have the ip address 192. this first three bits would be same because we can assign further addresses we need only 24 a but if it was like 100 or more than 100 so we would have to use three and then we will start from zero but here we have ip addresses remaining 192 so we have the subnet mask of 127. we would have 27 bits of one remaining zero these first three bill would become two five five two five five two five five and the last this number is equal to decimal in 224 in decimal and our range of 5 fee addresses will start from 193 because up till 192 we have already done and we'll start from 193 and it will go up to triple 2 because the first bit and the last bit as i told you is reserved so 224 minus 2 is equal to triple two so this is the maximum so we still have a few ip addresses left for this uh particular ip address which is uh 255 minus triple two so if we have another block which needs less addresses we can assign them so this is how we are going to assign ip addresses and now i'm going to tell you how we are going to implement all this ip addressing and subnetting netting in cisco packet tracer in this um example i've already uh told you that uh we are going to make basically four subnets uh so for that purpose uh i'm going to first of all um just randomly uh add pcs you know that we go to end devices and i'm going to select here generic so we are going to add the pcs here and right here so and definitely as you know that i told you people that from right here that uh the what do you say uh it blocks one third needs 136 or sign block 95 host so practically i cannot do it here so i'm just going to assign each network to to host and i'm going to give you a brief uh description of how the we can apply subnetting so now i'm going to add a um a switch here i'm going to add this one two nine six zero switch this one switch is for say um what our department was uh the first was um i t i t block you can see right this one was i t block this is how you can uh assign name or you can click here then go to config here display name you can change from here as well so again i'm going to add another switch this switch is for our science block block i'm going to add another switch which would be for our arts block the fourth switch that i'm going to add would be for the post graduate block and i'm going to write p g here simply okay after assigning this what i'm going to do now we will consider that these two pieces are part of it block these two are part of science block these two are for arts block and the last two are for pg blocks so we would have to connect uh these pcs with this switch so we are going to go to the connections and we are going to select the copper straight to wire click on the pc select fast ethernet take your mouse to the switch select any available interface i'm going to select the first one again a copy straight through from this pc fast ethernet to this switch and then select this zero slash two interface again straight through from this pc fast ethernet switch zero slash one straight through cable from this pc fast ethernet zero to our science block switch and any connection available same we are going to do from this pc fast ethernet zero to arts block select zero slash one interface come here then connect this pc fast ethernet 0 to this switch with zero slash two interface then we have here connection fast ethernet our switch zero slash one again straight through uh wire from here the last pc to our pg block switch which is zero slash two so here what we have done is we have connected um our switches to our pcs so what we are going to do to connect these all these networks we would be um using two routers so simply again go here um to your network devices and here select a router you can select any router i'm going to select this uh to a double one put it here and another router two eight double one we are going to put it here okay so so now we are going to connect these um switches with the router again we are going to use this uh straight um through cable from our zero slash three to the router uh zero slash zero so you should remember that the i t block is connected with the router on the fast ethernet zero slash zero in the same way we are going to connect science block switch with the on a zero slash three to our router and here we are going to select the interface zero slash one so size block is connected on zero slash one in the same way we are going to connect this arts block switch with this and i'm going to connect it on zero zero and again this switch would be connected select any interface and click here zero slash one so these are also connected but they are showing you red because of the fact that we haven't see that these uh connections are basically um showing you a red sign they are not connected because we still have to configure our routers so first of all to use these routers or to connect them together we have to click the router and add the module so we will going to the physical we are going to the physical tab and we are going to add the uh module w ic1t and before adding that we would have to uh turn off uh the router then add just click here wic a one t and drag and drop it here turn on the router again now close it now come to this router click it inside physical first of all you have to turn off the router then you are going to select wic 1t click drag and drop here turn on your router then close this now what we are going to do we are going to connect these both routers after adding the module uh to these routers go to this connection and we are going to select this serial dce connection click here go here to the router select zero slash three slash zero then take your mouse to the other router and here select again serial zero slash three slash zero so here our two routers are also connected and this router is almost ready uh to be a subnetted and to assign ip addresses um so uh what we are going to do is first of all i'm going to start by assigning ip addresses to our um pcs so uh let's first go to our first pc so for it block i'm going to go to this pc and inside desktop i'm going to go to ipconfiguration and then i'm going to check out my this particular slide here we have figured out that the ip addresses can start from 192.6168.1.1 and our this uh what do you say subnet mask would be this so i'm going to simply copy this ip address and i'm going to go to my cisco packet tracer and i'm going to give it this ip address 1.1 and subnet mask as you people know it is by default but our subnet mask as i decided here was 255.255.255.0 so that's fine and here in default gateway we would have to give the ipad address of the router it is connected to but i'm going to give it later um so let's go back uh to our next pc for the next pc i'm going to go to desktop i think ipconfiguration so here as you know that the first ip address was dot was 1.1 so i'm going to give ip address of 1.2 to our next pc which is here um 1.2 so you can give any ip address 1.6 1.71.8 up to 254 you can give any range and the subnet mask is this default gateway i will assign later then let's go to the science block pc i'm going to click the first pc desktop ip address and i'm going to go here the first address can start from this dot 168.2. so i'm going to copy here and i'm going to assign this pcip address of 2.1 and i'll come here and you can see that we can we are going to give this subnet mask as we have already calculated okay so i'm going to change it to one two eight this is done gateway i'll assign later and the next ip address i would give 192.168.2.2 i can give any ip address up till 1 2.126 so i'm going to assign 2.2 to this last pc desktop here 2.2 192.168.2.2 come here and you people know that we have this as our subnet mask 128 from here we already calculated so uh this is our router and here you can see that this one um if you can um see here this i connected this particular uh network on fast ethernet 0 0 and you know that the ip address of this uh particular if i go here is 162.192.168.1.1 so i can give the router any ip address 192.168.1 dot after that any range which would be um between one and this particular range two five four not more than two five four okay so i can assign any ip address uh to my router which is connected to this uh particular uh it block uh network so i will click this i will go to config inside config 0 0 because if you remember i connected uh the it block i click here when i and when i took my mouse here i selected fast ethernet 0 0 okay so i have connected this particular switch this network with zero slash zero interface so i'm going to go here i'm going to go to zero zero and we're now going to give it any ip address which is inside the range of this network and which i've already shown you dot one dot and i am going to give it randomly an ip address of 1 dot 100 and the ip address sorry the subnet mask of this network was 255.255.255.0 and we can also confirm from right here see this is the subnet mask and this was the range of ip addresses so i have chosen one randomly from here and then i'm going to turn it on so you should remember that the gateway is this this is the gateway that i have assigned so i'm going to close it i'm going to go back to this pc configuration and in gateway i am going to give this the address of the router because it would act as the gateway for this pc of it block and for this pc of id block as well so i am simply going to copy and paste the address now again i'm going to go to this router now you can see that it is turning uh green because i have assigned proper ip addresses and gateways now this switch of science block was connected to the router on interface fast ethernet 0-1 so we are going to go again here so i can assign ip address in this particular range starting and ending to my this particular router so simply what i'm going to do i'm going to assign ip address uh to this particular interface and here i'm going to uh give it an ip address of 2.100 190 [Music] so it is inside the range and i've randomly selected which is not already assigned and then subnet mask of this network is right here as you can see it is 255 255 255.128 so i'm going to write 128 here and i have to turn this interface on then i'm going to close it and if you go back you will see fast forward time this has also turned greed so again we are going to come here and i told you that i have connected this arts block on interface fast ethernet config 0 0 so let's give an ip address again i'm going to go to my hair network uh i can assign ip address starting from 2.129 so um for this here i'm going to give this get gateway and ip address of 2.190 randomly i'm going to assign it okay so 192.1 6 eight dot two dot one nine zero i have randomly signed it and its um subnet mask was right here you can see two five two five five two five five dot two so i have simply assigned that dot 192 and i have given it a random gateway that lies in the range of this particular network uh as we have assigned uh the uh gateway for fast ethernet zero slash zero now we are going to assign gateway for zero slash one and remember these two pieces are actually only connected to zero slash one and another thing what i have done is i actually forgot i forgot to turn it on that's why it's red so i'm going to fast forward times you can see these are green so you have to turn it on so we are now going to um select fast ethernet 0 1 let's go to our pg block pg block ip addresses are starting from 193 and it's uh um what do you say the subnet mask is 224 so i'm going to assign any address within this range to our router so let's see i'm going to assign it just randomly 192.168.2.222. this is the last ip address that we could assign so i have assigned it and uh it's it would be 224. if you remember uh the subnet mask right here is 224 so i have assigned this and i'm going to turn it on and then i'm going to close this and if we come back here we can see that fast forward time all these interfaces have now turned green but remember that we haven't assigned ip addresses to our these pcs so simply what i'm going to go i'm going to go to arts blog i'm going to give the first pc this address let's go here let's give it an ip address of this and it has a subnet mask of 1 9 0. how i know this excuse me okay so let's check it out again uh it has an as a 92 sorry it is um it has the ip address this and the subnet mask of one nine two right so here at the gateway uh we are going to see and now i am simply going to minimize this i'm going to go here and i am going to see what was the gateway so when i click this for 0 0 our address was uh 1 uh sorry for 0 zero my address was this so this is the gateway for our arts block uh network so simply i'm going to click here here gateway i'm going to assign this 190. let's close this now go to the next pc desktop ipconfiguration here we are going to give ip address of 192.168.2.194 the next one right here and the subnet mask was 192 and it has the same gateway the same router that's it we are going to assign uh ip addresses to the pg block systems and we are going to see what is our range our range is starting from here 192.168.2.193 so i'm going to assign it 1 9 3 okay let's assign this an ip address of 193.168.2.1.2 here and our subnet mask is double to four from where i came to know here we have already selected double to four so okay okay so it was 193 actually and two double to four and our gateway would be that is what we have to see we will come back here our gateway um was zero slash one it is two dot triple two one ninety two dot one six eight dot two dot triple two so i'm going to come here okay so for that particular interface with this uh pg block switch is connected the router address was 192.2.168.2.2 so here we have okay so let's come here desktop ipk configuration 192.168.2.194 okay the subnet mask is double to four and it has the same gateway and what uh why i have given 194 it was 193 the first one the next one and one i've randomly given 194. so this is how we have configured all the ip addresses you can see that the all the nodes in the networks are connected except for these two routers and as if you remember these are connected with the serial serial connection which if i click this router it was serial zero slash three zero so what ipf address i'm going to give you here you can go back to this power point here you can see that 224 was the maximum address assigned so i'm going to give any next uh address 2 2 5 2 2 6 2 7 or anything so what i'm going to give is i'm going to give it the ip address of 192.168.2.226 okay so let's assign this an ip address of 192.168.2.225. 192. and the subnet mask it is very important to calculate the subnet mask here here you can see that we have only two routers so when you have two router it means that we are going to use only uh the power of 2 so power of 2 means exactly these two bits 2 raised to the power 2 so instead of 7 we would be having 2 raised to the power 2 here and when you have 2 it would become [Music] 4 here okay so 32 minus 4 you would be having 28 so when we are going to be having 28 it means 24 25 26 27 28 so we would uh be having uh these one two three four five six so only the last two zeros would be unoccupied and this particular number uh in binary would be equivalent uh to 252 in our decimal notation so we can now give this network an ip subnet mask of 255.255.25.55.252 because we need only two addresses and i have told you how you can calculate it so i'm simply going to copy it we have given it an ib address of two to five i'm going to turn it on so let's give the next uh serial connection an ip address of 2 to 6 right here zero slash three slash zero i'm going to give an i then i p dress of 192.168.2.226 the first uh serial connection i gave an ip address of um uh two to five and now okay here i'm going to change it it's giving me an error again and again two five two i think it was two five two uh yes it was two five two so i'm going to turn it on now i have no error because the sub 10 mask was overlapping so it gave me an error so the first router serial here 0 0 i gave 2 to 5 because the next available ip dress this was the one and i gave it 2 2 6 here right and i have turned them on now you can see all the connections are green initially on this pc size i forgot to give a gateway so this is you are going to give 192.168.2.100 on both these pcs the gateway ipconfiguration.2.100 i forgot that so what i'm going to do i'm going to ping these pc uh this particular network so the ip address of this pc is 192.168.2.2 so i'm simply going to ping it from this first pc which is connected to another switch go to command prompt let's ping it 192.168.2.2 so you should see that previously i tried to ping it the request was timed out because i forgot to assign the gateway router for these pcs so let's see now if it's working now it's working and it's having the reply so uh you would have to give the gateway definitely so let's do another thing all these things are connected now let's try to ping from this pc to any pc of this network let's say this one let's see the ip address ip configuration 192.168.2.129 so let's try to ping it dot 2.129 okay it is dot 2 dot 1 2 9 ok it is saying reply but destination host unreachable it is not telling you sent 4 received 0 lost 4 it means that 100 percent of loss it is trying to connect it is getting reply but the reply is destination host unreachable so for that purpose this router must be told about the network here of this router and this router again must be told about the network present behind this router so what we are going to do we are simply going to click this router and here we are going to this go to config inside config we are going to go to static and we are going to add the network routes here uh let's do this now let's add uh the network route here so what i'm going to do i'm going to click this one i'm going to add network okay the network is 192.168.2 now i'll tell you why i have done this 255.255.255. the first one was slash 26 uh here i'm going to see uh slash here 26 the ip dress would be sorry this is the subnet mask i'm going to explain or you what i'm doing right now just give me a moment okay so what i have done here is 192.168.2 now you can see that i am here on this router and i am telling about these two pcs this is arts block this is pg block so i am going to give first entry of arts block so if we go here you can see the arts block this was the address the starting address for our arts block i have given the same address right here.196.12 192.168.2.128. the mask is this 255.255.25.192 and next hop next hop is basically the address of the router which is the this router so let's click this router go to 0 0 this ip address that i have given to this interface this i am going to give as the next hop here in this router so here i have given this first router the information about this arts block i am going to add it now i want to give this router the information about this pg block so for pg block i am going to come here this is the first ipaddress.1 so i'm going to give it 1.2.192 the mask for this particular network is 255 255 255.224 so i am going to give here dot 224 and the next hop router is this one the 2261 router this one the address of this router is 192.168.2.226 ad this particular network this network knows about arts block and pg block the same way we are going to tell this router about the networks of it block and science block so i have simply clicked this one router and i'm going to go to config static and then i'm going to give the ip address here we have written 92.168.1.0 this is the ip address 192.168.1.0 and its subnet mask as you can see is 255.255.2 as i have given here and the next hop is let's go here and this is the next hop let's see its ip address we will click this config serial and its ip address is 192.168.2.25225. so let's give the next hop as 192.168.2.225 ad now i have added all the information about it block now i am going to add information about the science block so let's see the first ip address of science block is 192.168.2.0 so we will give 192.168.2 and its subnet mask is let's see what's a subnet mask its subnet mask is two five five two five five two five five dot one two eight so let's go here dot one two eight i'm giving here it's subnet mask i have seen from here we already calculated and this is the address of the first router uh the router here on the left side the address of this router i have given has next hop and i'm going to add this so these are all added i'm going to close it now we are going to ping any pieces from for example this pc ip address is ipconfig 192.168.2.193 from here i am going to ping it dot 2.193 okay i'm going to ping 192.168.2.193 it is pinging and let's let's see if it gives us a reply or no okay first time request timed out the three packets were gone only one lost let's try it again now it is receiving reply so definitely it takes time now no packet was lost all packets were received that was sent so let's do the same thing from this network any pc here for example the ip address of this pc is 192.6 168.2.1 so from here command prompt ping 192. let's start pinging it now i am pinging uh from art's block a pc i'm going to ping which is in science block so first it's it timed out but then it is receiving reply three packets are received let's try it again i think now it is receiving reply for all the packets received for lost zero so this is how we have created sub networks the networks the subnet mask and we have used the pink amount to confirm that all the system all around this particular network or in which we have created a subnet are working perfectly and they are receiving the reply so i hope it was helpful for you and you understand all the concepts so i'll see you next time bye
