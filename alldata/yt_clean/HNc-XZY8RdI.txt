Hello Today I will try to show you this, [shot] [shot] [shot] and you ask me for the valve pin you ask me exactly, and other pins, e.g. steel, don't have this flange and you generally ask what this small flange is for and what it is responsible for another thing I want to show you, is why when mounting this pin in the plunger, or any other thread lock protection that prevents the pin from unscrewing I used two HDR50 revolvers for the test so far the revolvers are unfolded, because I'm already after shooting ;) I'll explain quickly what's going on in one revolver this piston is intact, and in the second revolver, when I unscrewed the pin, I damaged it, exactly this place, notch, for inserting a screwdriver so to unscrew it I had to drill it and the thread is slightly damaged and now has a slightly larger loose but everything works only slightly more loose actually good that it happened, The test will consist in the fact I used a lot of force in one piston that is undamaged, in the second HDR 50, and this thread is thoroughly cleaned, and I screwed this pin very tightly into the plunger as well in one revolver I used a steel pin with a collar, and in the other revolver, I conducted the test using one new CO2 capsule in both revolvers I fired empty, without use balls then I will quickly unfold both revolvers, see it now ;) [shot 1] [shot 2] [shot 3] [shot 4] [shot 5] [shot 6] [shot 7] [shot 8] [shot 9] [shot 10] [shot 11] [shot 12] [shot 13] [shot 14] [shot 15] [shot 16] [shot 17] [shot 18] [shot 19] [shot 20] [shot 21] [shot 22] [shot 23] [shot 24] [shot 25] [shot 26] now I will quickly unfold the revolver, [on my channel you will find a detailed video I wonder how to show it to you ... but I can feel it in my fingers.... ... that the pin is already loose and wobbling side to side ... maybe I will try to show it this way that,.... pay attention to this inscription ... and now I will try to tighten the pin, did you see? I'll take out the screwdriver and I will show you more or less again the pin is unscrewed, about half a turn it is a piston with slight thread damage it was reamed after a pin was damaged therefore there is slightly more loose which further enhances the effect of self-twisting of the pin ok, now let's see what it looks like in the second revolver [on my channel you will find detailed disassembly and assembly videos ok, let's see if it will be similar here the thread in this plunger has no signs of wear the thread is intact we will check it the same way, pay attention to that white text we'll see if the pin is unscrewed or if it looks better it unscrewed slightly and now I don't need to use force to unscrew it pin holds better, and I also left some old adhesive residue [no old glue should be left behind, the pin is so loose that I don't have to use any force to unscrew it okay, let me summarize quickly I'll take the original aluminum pin the point is that if you screw the pin into the plunger, when shooting, this pin will loosen by itself, and as you can see, there is not much of this thread here, because the pin will wobble in all directions, and will therefore confidently create resistance in this bushing because it will wedge more precisely because it will not slide in centrally but will slide in at an angle, the pin and the sleeve may be slightly damaged, if you have a pin with this collar, you ask why is this collar here this collar causes this collar will set the pin in the right position and ensure that the thread is not overloaded while the pin is working even when the pin twists, but not more than 1mm the collar will prevent the pin from wobbling in all directions but of course, if you don't use the thread lock, and this flange will come out of the sleeve inside, it is known that the effect of this &quot;wobbling&quot; pins on all sides, I hope this video will be helpful for you, especially as there are several types of thread locks, so if this pin is for some reason, because you won't be looking inside for a long time, if for some reason you often replace this pin, it will be enough, and after some time you will judge, or do you need to upgrade to something stronger thanks for watching ,
