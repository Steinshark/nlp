Steve: I'm just saying I find it crazy how you say that ghosts aren't real! Alex: Heh, heh. Yeah, and I'm just saying that I've never seen something that can't be explained by, like: &quot;That was just the wind.&quot; or &quot;Someone must've moved that there! Steve: Pssht. Okay. I think you're just too scared to admit it. *door slams* Steve: Doesn't believe in ghosts. &quot;Ooh, look at me! My name's Alex and I'm too big and brave!&quot; TV: Welcome to, uh, Potion Events! You wanna come get a potion and, uh, not be visible? We got invisible potions, can't be seen! Look... (Background chatter) Steve: (Gasp) What? (Background chatter) Ohhh, don't believe in ghosts, do you, Alex? We'll see about THAT. Ahahahahaha! Steve: Psst... *yeet* Alex: Oh, I thought I just put all these away...? Oh well, no biggy. Alex: Huh, we should really get that light fixed. Alex: Huh... Guess we... redecorated. Alex: Uh-huh... I guess he was warm? Alex: Huh?! I must have caught it so quickly, it didn't have time to fall! Eh, yes... That... Heh... Steve: Aw, come on! Nothing I'm doing is working! I need to think of something SO scary, that the only possible thing it could be IS a ghost! Steve: So, to set the mood, I need thunder! But not JUST thunder... LIGHTNING! Steve: And now, for some creaking on the roof. You think you could do that? Skeleton: (Creak) Steve: And you, you need to bang on the door as hard as you can. Got it? Baby Zombie: (Growl) Steve: And now... We wait to strike. Steve: Creeeeeeeeaaaak... Skeleton: (Creak) Alex: Huh? (Banging) Alex: Uh... Uh... Who's there?! (Intense creaking and banging) Steve: Aaaaalleeeeexx... Aaaaaaaaallleeeeex! (More intense creaking and banging) Steve: Ooooooohh! Alex: Hey, Steve. Steve: Oooooohhh! Who is this &quot;Ste--&quot;? Alex: You know I can see you, right? Steve: Ugh, I'm sorry, Alex. I just thought that if I scared you enough, you would believe that ghosts are real. Alex: Well, there is nothing you could do that would possibly change my mind- Ooooooohhhhh... Steve: Well, that's not me doing that, because I'm right here. Ooooooohhhh! Both: AAAAAHHHHHHHHHH! Villager: Ahem... Does anybody have a cup of sugar? We've run out, and I'm making a ca- Awww, they're gone. Steve: Alex, are you in here? Helloooooo? Huh, guess she's not in. Huh, well, this looks strangely familiar... *Gasp!* Steve: It was just a PRAAAAAAAAAAAANK! Steve: Oh, Oh, Oh! It's the map of where we live! Ehem, *sniff* I mean, uh... I'm sure she wouldn't notice if I borrowed this for a while. And by a while, I mean uh... Forever. :) 0o0 Hmm... I wonder what this could be used for? Alex: HEY! Steve: WHA-JEEZ-DA! (Deep Breath) Don't scare me like that! Alex: Yeah, being scared isn't very nice, is it? Hint hint... So, um... what'cha workin' on? Steve: Oh, hehe... oh, you know, just... regular old Steve stuff! Hehe... Heh... Alex: Well, since you're not busy, why don't you help me make a cake? Steve: Uh, yeah! Sure. What do you need? Alex: Hmm... It says &quot;Three parts wheat...&quot; Which I think I saw a field of it just over that hill! Steve: Uhh... Are you sure it's THAT hill, and not THIS one instead? Alex: Huh? Steve: Pshh, Why travel all that way, when I just happen to have some already? Alex: Oh, Perfect! Okay, so, now for... Ah! Two parts sugar. Steve: Uhhh... does it say anything about &quot;three&quot;? Alex:The book is very specific on it being only TWO parts sugar. Steve: *gulp* Steve: ALEX I HAVE YOUR SUGAR AND YOUR SUGAR FOR YOU, AND YOUR SUGAR RIGHT HERE!! I'M PUTTING IT RIGHT HERE, ALEX, RIGHT HERE! WHAT NEXT, WHA'S NEXT, WH'Z N'XT?!

We've got everything we need to make the perfect cake! I'll put all of this together and shout for you when it's ready. Steve: Ahh... I'm such a good friend to her. Maybe I should give myself a little reward for being so nice... Maybe it should be, uhhh... oh, I dunno... a bunch'a diamonds! Creeper: Tsss... Steve: Wuh-oh. Alex: Hmmm... I'll just leave this here to cool down for a while. Steve: WaaaaAaAaaAAAAAAAAAAAAhH! AAAAAAA-- *bOOM* Steve: oooooh, no. Alex: Eh? OwO Hmm. Steve! Have you seen my map? I can't find it anywhere... wHoa. Steve: Ohhh, hey, Alex! Didn't see you from all the way down there.

Steve: Yeah, well if you could... best to just forget about it wELL! Let me show you the new - and improved - House of Steve! Alex: Ehh... Is &quot;improved&quot; the word to use for a house made out of nothing but wood? Steve: AHA! But YOU know it's a house, so I'm onto winner here! But don't let looks deceive you, Alex. You haven't even seen the inside yet! Let me show you. It's got a: *gaAaaAASp* kitchen, a bathroom, a bedroom, a balcony, a cloakroom, a pantry, a landing(?) and library! An office, a toilet, a conservatory, an attic, a dining room, fireplace, shower AND-- Alex: Wait, w-w-w-wait, wait. What did you just say? Steve: Oooh! I see. Realizing how much better MY house is than yours, you stopped me before I could finish as to not rub it in. Pshht! So transparent. Oh, and if you were paying attention? It was a SHOWER, Alex. C'mon. Keep up. Alex: Uh huh, sure. But before that, did you say &quot;fireplace&quot;? Steve: Uh huh, Alex, okay. I think I know what I said. Alex: Okay. Okay, so, to be clear: you built a fireplace. Steve: Uh huh. Alex: In a house... Steve: Uh huh... Alex: Made of wood? Steve: ... ...Yes!

You're scared of heights, aren't you? Alex: I wouldn't say &quot;scared&quot;, heheh... More like, um... Rationally TERRIFIED?! Steve: Ha! What's there to be worried about? Alex: How about the fact if it goes wrong you can be SQUISHED in an INSTANT?! Steve: &quot;Goes wrong&quot;? A-heh. Okay. And when has that ever happened before?
