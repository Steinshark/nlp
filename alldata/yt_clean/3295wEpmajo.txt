Basmalla. We are late, come on. Basmalla. Let me sleep a bit longer. It's OK, it's OK. I hate jasmine. I hate it because I have to wake up early and sometimes I sleep under the trees. Do you know where the jasmine flowers go? The jasmine flowers I gather are and are sold all over the world. Perfume is a $50 billion industry And there's one flower Considered to be the most The most beautiful flower The most exotic and wonderful Jasmine. &lt;i&gt;BBC Eye Investigations takes you to&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to reveal dark secrets&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Children, some as young as five years old,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;are working in dangerous conditions&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and pickers are earning&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;While huge profits are made&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;This investigation reveals who the real&lt;/i&gt; There is this hidden layer. They are the ones controlling everything &lt;i&gt;And how they are falling short&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that they're promoting publicly.&lt;/i&gt; They are not actually doing things It's very disturbing. I did not imagine that the situation &lt;i&gt;As we expose for the first time&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;in the supply chains of some of&lt;/i&gt; The jasmine season is six months long and the most important element Mohamed grew up in the village &lt;i&gt;the centre of the jasmine trade in Egypt.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Around 720 acres of land across the region&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;are planted with these precious flowers.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Mohamed used to work&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but now he organises tours&lt;/i&gt; We organise these tours to show people It's very tiny, incredibly soft Let me tell you which This is where the largest &lt;i&gt;Mirna El-Helbawi, a human rights activist&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;has joined Mohamed's tour to look into&lt;/i&gt; Wow. It is a very delicate process. The person who started the industry here He was the one who introduced That started in the 1960s. Our jasmine is, uh, My name is Hussein Fakhry and I'm owner/president Jasmine is a lady of the night, so she only has a story to tell you at night. So you want to catch that fragrance. All people see is the romance of it. But they do not see the other side. They do not see the people who work hard &lt;i&gt;When the sun goes down in this region,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;there is a secret world of the perfume&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Mirna wants to meet the people&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And is heading to fields situated&lt;/i&gt; I need to see who the pickers are Drink that, it will wake you up. Come on, come on. Basmalla. We'll be late, come on. Have we arrived? It's all very dark. I'm a bit worried, but let's see how this day will go. Good morning. How are you? I'm good. Oh, how pretty. Hello. Hello. How are you? Good, thank God. Let's go, children. &lt;i&gt;Egyptian jasmine blooms just after sunset.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;In order to catch the fragrance,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the flower needs to be picked&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Heba's family is one&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that have to start work&lt;/i&gt; I come here early with my children. I only have one headlamp and my children won't be Come on. Come on, Anas. So you won't be late for nursery. There are many mosquitoes here. Oh God. Oh God. &lt;i&gt;The pickers have to strain&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and fight through mosquitoes&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;as they gather&lt;/i&gt; The strong smell from jasmine Some of my children have skin allergies and they keep scratching their skin. Basmalla is a very beautiful name. What happened to your hand? Does your hand hurt? Yes. Because of my hand, I can't collect quickly. Is that because your hand hurts? But normally you can? What do you want to be when you grow up? A doctor. A doctor? &lt;i&gt;Like the majority of jasmine pickers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Heba and her children work&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;from June to November.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The temperature can reach&lt;/i&gt; When the sun comes up the pickers of which there are hundreds. Once the flowers have been weighed, they are transported to factories These are the main three: The factories extract jasmine oil from the flowers to sell to fragrance houses Whose flowers are these? They are mine. Let me see how much I gathered. 600g I gathered a lot today. 650g 1kg is worth 45 EGP ($1.40). Four people working to make from before dawn to 08:00 or 09:00. What can 30 EGP ($1) buy you, when a single watermelon costs &lt;i&gt;Heba, like most of the jasmine pickers,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and works on a smallholder farm.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Out of what she earns&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to the owner of the land&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Heba alone picked&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But with the help of her children picking,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;she managed to deliver 1.5 kilos of&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;leaving the family with roughly&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Inflation in Egypt is at an all-time high.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Egyptian pound has depreciated&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Relatively, independent pickers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;than they have ever done before&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and are living below the poverty line.&lt;/i&gt; In the past, the price of jasmine was good. The price of jasmine was in line with When we compare what it was like then to today, now I would have to work non-stop for a month just to be able to afford a kilo of meat. Some people say that a kilo of jasmine We were surprised to find that it's actually 30 EGP ($1). I hope they raise the price of jasmine Tell me, have you ever struggled to buy food Of course it happens. When my daughter tells me she wants and I just can't afford it, what can I do to make sure she's well-fed? Basmalla. Basmalla. Take this money. 15 EGP for falafel and 10 EGP for beans. Come on, quickly. I did not imagine that it would be this bad. I wasn't prepared to see 5, 6, 7-year-old kids to collect jasmine in the dark For what? For less than 30 EGP ($1) a day. This is ridiculous, ridiculous. &lt;i&gt;At the start of every season,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the price for a kilo of jasmine flowers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The low price is the reason why&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But how many other families&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;During the summer of 2023,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;We spoke to many residents and&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;a significant number of jasmine pickers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;were children under the age of 15&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And we can reveal that most of the flowers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;via collection points, to the main factories:&lt;/i&gt; Multiple sources have also told us &lt;i&gt;directly owned by one of the factories:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Machalico.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But we had no way of accessing them.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Unless we went undercover.&lt;/i&gt; Do you collect daily? Yes. Do you come here to help your parents? Yes. It is certainly tiring work and we work for long periods. Are there children here too? Yes, there are children who collect. How old are you? Fourteen. Fourteen years old? How old are you? Twelve. &lt;i&gt;In Egypt, it is illegal for any child&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to work between the hours&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But in a multi-billion dollar industry&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Back in Cairo, Mirna is trying to find out more&lt;/i&gt; So, I have this bottle of perfume. It's one of my top favourites. Lancome Idole Intense. It has the scent of the fields of Al-Gharbia That's why I love it so much. It opens up with notes of mandarin orange, This is the perfumer who made this perfume. Currently serving at Givaudan. Oh, at Givaudan. &lt;i&gt;The perfume supply chain goes far beyond&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The factories sell their jasmine oil&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;where perfumes are created.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Givaudan, based in Switzerland,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;is one of the largest&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;valued at $38 billion.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And they've been sourcing their jasmine oil&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But where does Givaudan fit&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;We spent months speaking to&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;from the factories to the fragrance houses.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Most were too afraid to go on the record.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;We arranged meetings with people&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and received message after message&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;explaining that no-one&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But one established perfumer&lt;/i&gt; Christophe Laudamiel spent years working &lt;i&gt;where he created&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and Amber Absolute for Tom Ford.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He now works independently.&lt;/i&gt; In the perfume industry, there is this hidden layer, very little known from the public, which we can call the masters of the perfume industry. &lt;i&gt;As consumers, we are able to choose&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that are sold by world famous brands.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But these perfume brands are owned&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;A hidden layer considered to be&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Our investigation reveals&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;in some of the perfumes owned&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;L'Oreal and Estee Lauder,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and specifically their brands&lt;/i&gt; These companies, they decide how or what is going to go in the bottles. They decide about the packaging and they impose a very strict budget to create the fragrance. That budget, it trickles down. Really, that shackle, if you wish, trickles down, all the way down to the harvesters. &lt;i&gt;A more complete picture of the masters'&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;When L'Oreal&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;they want to put a bottle of perfume&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;they send a brief and a budget&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;like Givaudan and Firmenich,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and jasmine is sourced&lt;/i&gt; These hidden masters that people they sign contracts with the brands So in fact, the brands don't know Those masters organise all this for them. But the masters interest is to have the cheapest oil possible to put in the fragrance bottle and to sell it as expensive as possible The fragrance that is in that bottle costs to the masters about, on average, $1. In that $1, you have the salary of the perfumers, the salary of the harvesters, the distillery, the logistics to get all these ingredients to make the fragrance. &lt;i&gt;If the liquid inside our perfume bottles&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;what are we really paying for?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Industry experts have given us a breakdown&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of the estimated costs that go into&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;a $100 bottle of perfume.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;This further indicates that the jasmine pickers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;receive a very small fraction&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of what we consumers spend.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The fragrance industry is booming,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;with more people buying perfume&lt;/i&gt; Best jasmine perfumes. I have over 400 bottles of perfume. Yes, it's a lot of fragrance but... &lt;i&gt;Three thousand new fragrances&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;with many brands including Egyptian jasmine&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and are sold on the market&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;While it's boom time for the industry,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the pickers are not seeing&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and are struggling despite promises&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and the fragrance houses.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;In their promotional material, they paint&lt;/i&gt; Our products and day-to-day actions contribute to the health and well-being At L'Oreal Group, we create the beauty, Our business without the communities where we source We want to ensure they benefit &lt;i&gt;One of the largest fragrance houses,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;We do not practice or tolerate&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and do not provide employment to children.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They've taken photos from Al-Gharbia&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to promote their commitments in protecting&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And they say in one of their glossy web pages:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;We work directly with local smallholder farmers.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Our work also contributes to more stable incomes&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But the promotional material&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;doesn't match with what we've seen&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Basmalla's eyes have started to cause her pain.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And today her mother, Heba,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;30 kilometres away from her village.&lt;/i&gt; Welcome. Hi, Basmalla. How are you doing? Good. Tell me, what's wrong with your eyes? Whenever I wake up, and they burn. I start gathering jasmine at 03:00. 03:00? Yes. So you always gather I finish at 07:30 or 08:00. That's a lot, you work Keep your eyes on the balloon. What is this? I can't see it. OK, what about this? She has a very severe allergy. Even the whites of her eyes are changing colour. If she is to continue with this type of work without treating these inflammations, it would affect her eyesight But you're clever. Right? Because you go to Quran school and to work. I wish you a speedy recovery. &lt;i&gt;The doctor fees and medication were expensive.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And Heba and her children&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;losing a day's pay.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The promises to support the communities&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;go far beyond glossy promotional material.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Every layer of the supply chain has also signed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;pledging to abide by UN guidelines&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;promoting safe working practices&lt;/i&gt; My son is five years old. Children shouldn't wake up at 03:00 It's very disturbing. With took our evidence the United Nations Special Rapporteur On paper, they are promising so many good things, like supply chain transparency and the fight against child labour. Looking at this footage, they are not actually doing things It may look like an empty promise, just a ticking box exercise. There is no safety consideration. They are not able to receive education, and their mental and physical wellbeing are affected as a result of that. And from what I see from this footage is but to rely on their children to make money. All of these are quite clear indicators which may constitute the worst form of child labour. &lt;i&gt;Why is accountability throughout&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;with no international regulation,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and clear guidelines from the UN?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;We spoke to a senior executive who works&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They agreed to speak to us&lt;/i&gt; What you first need to realise is that and the fragrance house is an informal If a human rights issue the masters meet with The masters would never at the factories or fields, for example. Instead, they rely on us to instruct to prove that due diligence checks &lt;i&gt;Two of the main auditing firms that&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;are Sedex and UEBT.&lt;/i&gt; Sedex is a global membership organisation that helps identify and manage The UEBT Ethical BioTrade Standard was developed to help companies &lt;i&gt;Both Sedex and UEBT assure their clients&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;So why has child labour been missed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;despite their supply chains&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;These audit reports are&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and to obtain them you have to be&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;So we're contacting one of the main producers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;A. Fakhry &amp; Co,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;posing as a potential buyer wanting to buy&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;After the visit to the factory, they sent us&lt;/i&gt; The Sedex report from &lt;i&gt;However, the visit was pre-announced,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;they visited during the day and only&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;62 employees were noted to be working there,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the youngest worker being 32 years old.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;There was no mention of the jasmine farms&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;or the thousands of pickers that are working&lt;/i&gt; Sarah Dadush is a Professor of Law and founder &lt;i&gt;where she works on improving human rights&lt;/i&gt; A lot of these fragrance companies say, &quot;Oh, we have all kinds to ensure that there is no child labour But what your research reveals is that The auditors are only auditing And so that may not include, uh, It may not include the price When we went through the UEBT report &lt;i&gt;we found that they had&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and there was an indication&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;although there are no further details&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and no mention of child labour.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And, despite this, A. Fakhry and Co.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;which means the company can advertise&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that they offer&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;We asked Sedex and UEBT for a comment&lt;/i&gt; Sedex: Sedex is firmly against all forms of labour rights abuses; we exist to help businesses address these. Sedex: But no one tool alone can or should be relied in to uncover and remediate all environmental and human rights risks or impacts. UEBT: UEBT conducted field assessments in Egypt in 2023. UEBT: One company has been issued a responsible sourcing attestation, subject to an action plan which we reviewed and approved. UEBT: The attestation is valid till mid 2024, and will be withdrawn if the action pan is not implemented. Audit schemes are really just of a business model The major root cause is the price. The price is something that is of the fragrance houses and of the masters. They are the ones that are setting the budget for how much is going to be put in &lt;i&gt;Things are changing and legislation&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;In 2017, France passed a duty of vigilance law&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that requires large French companies to identify&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;through the impact of their activities&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;by publishing annual vigilance plans.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And in April 2024,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the Corporate Sustainability&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It's a major piece of legislation that once&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;EU and non-EU companies to conduct&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;across their entire value chain.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;If companies fail to comply&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;they may be held liable&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;We put all of our findings&lt;/i&gt; L'Oreal: We never request Fragrance Houses to go lower than the market price for ingredients at the expense of farmers. L'Oreal: Despite our strong commitments and actions, we know that in certain parts of the world where L'Oreal suppliers operate there are risks to our commitments being upheld. L'Oreal: In January 2024, our partner performed an on-site human rights impact assessment to identify potential human rights violations and find ways to prevent and mitigate them, with a focus on the child labour risks. L'Oreal: L'Oreal is actively committed to respecting the most protective internationally recognized human rights standards. L'Oreal: L'Oreal Group also publishes yearly global vigilance plans. Estee Lauder: We believe the rights of all children should be protected. And we have contacted our suppliers to investigate this very serious matter. Estee Lauder: We are taking action to gain better transparency and to work toward improving the livelihoods of sourcing communities. How much is this? 5 EGP ($0.16). Didn't I tell you to buy beans for 10 EGP? That's what I bought. How much is the falafel? 15 EGP ($0.49). And this? 10 EGP ($0.32). Have some bread. Take some bread. Is this the falafel you bought? Yes. The best falafel, I swear. Thank you. Eat, don't be shy. Eat, because in two minutes there won't be I like it, I like it. I like it, I like it. This perfume was a gift from one of my friends. It contains Egyptian jasmine. The one that you... ...we collect. Yes, the jasmine you collect. Jasmine. Can you guess the price? About 200 EGP ($6.50)? 1,000 EGP ($32.50)? This... costs... $300. About 10,000 EGP. We collect 1kg of jasmine, from 03:30 or 03:00, four children and their mother, until 07:30 or 08:00. And in the end, we get 30-35 EGP ($1), for a bottle of perfume that costs 10,000 EGP ($300) It's not fair. Did you imagine that the jasmine you collect We all know that. But no-one listens or speaks to us or cares about us. We've said it so much. People here are worth nothing. You haven't seen everything, by the way. Far worse things happen. You should see us when the ground is wet, the children crawl on their knees As their mother, I cry for them, I don't mind people using perfume, but I want the people using this perfume to see the pain of children in it, and to speak up, so that the factory owners and their clients can see the pain of children. It's not right that they're exploiting the &lt;i&gt;We asked the three main factories&lt;/i&gt; A. Fakhry and Co. and Hussein Fakhry: Child labour is entirely prohibited at both our farm, Hussein Fakhry Farm, and in the factory. A. Fakhry and Co. and Hussein Fakhry: Over 99% of our jasmine is sourced from independent collectors who collect the product from independent farmers. A. Fakhry and Co. and Hussein Fakhry: In 2018, under the monitoring of the UEBT, we commenced the Jasmine Plant Protection Products Mitigation Project, which imposes a prohibition on individuals under the age of 18 working on the farms. A. Fakhry and Co. and Hussein Fakhry: The suggestion that the jasmine flower price paid to farmers and pickers puts them below the poverty line is simply wrong. A. Fakhry and Co. and Hussein Fakhry: To the contrary, by any comparable agricultural standards in Egypt, jasmine-picking is well-remunerated. Machalico: Machalico doesn't use any pickers whose age is under 18 years old. Machalico: Every year the price is discussed between the owners of the different factories. Machalico: For two successive years, Machalico has increased the price, on September 2023 and October 2023 respectively. Machalico: For the 2024 crop of jasmine, we'll increase the price. Hashem Brothers: We refuse to comment on the report, which is based on misleading information. Ikat Jasmine, The masters, it's in their interest to have the public believe with marketing campaigns, we have jasmine from Egypt, that sounds very sexy and poetic. But there's a big disconnect between the preciousness in the marketing talk and what is actually given to the harvesters. I find it ridiculous. You know, they have to work that very tiny amount and other companies are able to sell It is unfair. The workers need to get paid fairer wages. &lt;i&gt;All of the entities in the perfume industry&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;accept that they have a responsibility&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and condemn child labour.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But in addition to inadequate&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and a lack of transparency&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;it appears that the masters have also failed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to recognise the impact&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;have on the livelihoods of the jasmine pickers.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;If anything is to change, it will be a commitment&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to take a shared responsibility&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;reaches the people who pick&lt;/i&gt; So, as a consumer, how can we make sure This shouldn't be on consumers. This is not a problem We need law, we need we need corporate accountability, and that cannot just be on the consumers. Givaudan: The concerns raised in the BBC report are deeply alarming. Givaudan: Improving the lives of communities in the jasmine supply trade is a responsibility for the entire chain, and it's incumbent upon us all to continue taking action to remove the risk of child labour entirely. Symrise: Child labour - in whatever form - diametrically contrasts the principles and standards that we provide ourselves, our suppliers and all other actors across the supply chain. IFF: We have zero tolerance for child labour. We have engaged a trusted third-party human rights expert to conduct an independent review of our supply chain. Firmenich: We have now fully transitioned to a new supplier in Egypt. Firmenich: We will work to support initiatives that seek to collectively address this issue with industry partners and local jasmine farmers and we are willing to help fund such initiatives.
