hey YouTube welcome to the ipv4 subject mastery video series this video series will be all you need to become a sub mini pro this is video 1 where we lay the foundation we will answer the core question what is submitting then talk through every attribute you can extract from a submitting problem first you want to answer the question what is submitting submitting is nothing more than taking one network in dividing it into sub networks for example this is the 10.0.0.0 s from 10.0.0.0 through 10 not 0.025 5 this set of IP s contains 256 IP addresses this is a refer to as a slash 24 network if you're unfamiliar with that terminology don't worry it'll make more sense later the process of subnetting is simply taking one network and breaking it up into smaller networks for instance I can take this slash 24 and break it up into two equal slash 25 first 25 includes the IP address 10.0.0.0 through dot 127 the second slash 25 includes the IP addresses 1000 128 through dot 255 I could also break the slash 24 into four equal parts or even eight equal parts in each case I'm taking the original slash 24 network and dividing all 256 addresses into smaller sub networks I also have the option to mix and match here I've taken the original slash 24 and broke it up into a slash 25 to slash 27 and a slash 26 when you divide one Network into sub networks there are seven pieces of information you can extract from each subnet every sub earning problem you'll ever encounter will require you to solve for one or more of these seven items for the rest of this video we will define what each of these items are the rest of the videos in this series will explain how to solve for them we will start with the bottom two the number of IP addresses is simply the total number of addresses in each block we mentioned earlier that the original slash 24 had a total of 256 addresses we initially broke them up into two equal halves which means each hat contains 128 addresses then we broke them up into eight equal sub networks which means each slash twenty seven contains 32 addresses that is all the number of addresses are into simply the total count of addresses in each subnet we've been referring to sub networks as slash 25s or / 26 s or / 27 this is known as Sider notation a Sider notation simply identifies the size of a particular subnet there's another way to define the size of the subnet and that is known as the subnet mask you will need to know how to convert between subnet masks and Sider notation for example a slash 25 can be represented as the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 / 27 can be represented as 255.255.255.0 4 in both cases the cider or subnet mask simply indicate the size of a particular subnet or essentially the number of IP addresses in each subnet something else you'll need to know to solve for when subnetting is the network ID the network ID is simply the first possible address in each subnet in our slash 25 this would be the IP address 10.0.0.0 in our slash 27 this is the IP address 10.0.0.0 in a you'll also need to solve for the broadcast IP this is the last possible address in each subnet for our slash 25 this would be 10.0.0.0 27 for our slash 27 this would be 10 not 0 dot 0 dot 189 both the network ID and the broadcast IP serve a special purpose in each subnet therefore they are not allowed to be assigned to any user who is receiving an IP address within the IP block for example in the slash 25 users could be assigned the IP address as down 16 dot 24.80 but they can't be assigned the IP address as 10.0.0.0 or dot 127 which means in the slash 25 there was a total of 128 addresses but only 126 of them are usable or in the slash 27 which had a total of 32 addresses but only 30 of them are usable to be assigned to hosts the function of the network ID along with the cider or subnet mask is to identify a specific subnet for example you can refer to this block of addresses using the notation 10.00 128 / 27 be careful though because the network ID alone isn't enough it must be coupled with the cider or mask for example if we use the network ID 10.0.0.0 with a mask of slash 24 this refers to all 256 addresses but if we use the same network ID plane mask of slash 25 this would refer to just this chunk of 128 addresses broadcast IP is a special address in each subnet that allows the user to speak to every other IP within the subnet for example if there were 10 hosts in this / 25 network I could speak to all of them at the same time by sending a packet to the IP address 10.0.0.0 nt7 now that we understand what the network ID and broadcast IP are and that they are not usable as host addresses we can see the importance of being able to solve for the first host IP in the last host IP these two values will give us our usable IP range first host IP is simply the IP address immediately after the network ID in our slash 25 our network idea was 10.0.0.0 therefore our first host IP is 10.0.0.0 7 our net ID was 10 not sort of 0.1 28 therefore our first host IP is 10 not 0 dot 0 dot 1 29 the last host IP is simply the IP address immediately before the broadcast IP in our slash 25 the broadcast IP was dot 127 therefore our last host IP is 1000 2000 slash 27 our broadcast IP it was dot 159 therefore our last host IP is 10.00 158 and finally we've arrived to our last attribute the next network the next network is simply the network ID of the subnet that follows for our slash 25 and next subnet is this one right here and the network ID of that subnet is 10.0.0.0 28 therefore the slash 25 s next network is 10.00 dot 128 but there is also another potentially easier way to solve for the next network notice the slash 25 s next network of dot 128 was exactly 1 more than the broadcast IP the next network will always be the IP address after the broadcast IP in our slash 27 since the broadcast IP address will stop 159 the next network would consequently be dot 160 which indeed would be the network ID of the following subnet notice dot 160 is the first IP address in the subsequent slash 27 these are the seven attributes of subnetting hopefully now you understand what each of them are every sub mini question you'll ever receive will simply require you to solve for one or more of these seven items this video series will illustrate a most efficient way to determine each of these attributes we will be using a cheat sheet to simplify the calculations the next video will show you how to draw the cheat sheet the video after that one will show you how to use it with this cheat sheet and the instructions in this video series you'll be able to solve for all seven of these attributes in 60 seconds or less [Music]
