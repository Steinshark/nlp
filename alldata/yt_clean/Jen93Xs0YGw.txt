What a track. Yeah, very funky. Played this a lot. You know, the thing is, this is all 30 years ago, so sometimes I have a hard time where I was last weekend, That sounds so familiar. Man, I've played this track so many times. Yeah, I definitely know this. Oh, I know this track. We all know this one. But... Sounds like KMS records, It's... Voorn Orlando Voorn. Of course it's Orlando Voorn. It's Orlando Voorn, The Fix. Fix, Fix. Project Fix. 'Flash' or something. Fix, 'Flash'. Fix, 'Flash'. Yep. KMS records 1992. Okay, good start. For sure, I played this a lot. I have it. No chance. This record right here was a very special record Don't remember, I don't remember. No idea what it is, it sounds amazing. It's Illuminatae here. Yeah, that's XVX 1, Illuminati Illuminatae? I would never have known The name is 'Tremora del Terra'. It's a strange title. And sometimes, back in the days they were giving such a weird, like, mars or planets type of landscapes, And I remember the 'Tremora del Terra' because it's... For me it's like being on Mars. I love kicks like that. Always works. Dry with a lot of reverb. Very early 90s. Acid approach. Timeless. I'm not doing too good on this one. I know this track. I used to play this, too, but... It's a Richie one. It sounds like Richie Hawtin. Richie Hawtin. Is this F.U.S.E.? F.U.S.E., it's F.U.S.E.. F.U.S.E.? F.U.S.E.? Must be F.U.S.E.. F.U.S.E., of course. Something factory or something Steam train, train... ride. Something with the train I think. Something about a train of thought I don't know, let me call Richie, I'll just ask. Man. I love this. That's a great track. I still play that. Distinctive sound created by a very unique artist, this one. Love this. This kick drum was sampled for the track, Jones &amp; Stephenson, 'The First Rebirth'. I totally hear, there. You totally hear 'The First Rebirth'. Yeah. This kick drum has definitely paid It's been around the block, It's Aphex Twin isn't it. Aphex Twin. Trying to remember it because it wasn't Aphex he didn't use... it didn't come out as Aphex Twin or AFX. Polygon Window. Polygon Window. Polygon Window. Polygon Window? Yeah Polygon Window... ah okay. I'm pretty sure the track's called 'Quoth'? 'Quoth'. The track is called 'Quoth'. There's nothing better than that. That's Techno, simple, effective. The purest form. Nice Pads, I like that. That's the Trance I like. That was definitely in the record box. There's so much on it. It's a cool track. Oh it's... what is it called again? I don't know. No idea. Yeah this one... I know this one okay. Secret Cinema. Secret Cinema. Secret cinema. Again no idea of the title. 'Timeless Altitude'. Yeah, I... Yeah, my memory's coming back! Or maybe my spicy margarita is helping. I think I know it, yeah. Oh that brings back so many memories of The Omen. Yeah this one I'm going to have a problem with. I never really liked that one Yeah the sequence doesn't really appeal to me. It's a bit.. I find it a bit irritating and Yeah anyway. This has got a French tends to it's. F Communications. It's Laurent. Laurent Garnier. Mr. Laurent Garnier. Laurent Garnier. It is... No idea what the title of the song is. Astral Dream. Astral Dreams. He is going to hate me if I say I never liked this track! Sorry Laurent, I'm just very frank. I love you anyway. Oh yes. Yeah that's a great record, yeah, it's a great track. Great one. Oh my god, I love it. Yeah, I'm a big fan. It's Luke. It sounds very much like Luke Slater. My good friend Luke Slater.

He did so many tracks, so many. It's impossible to remember all. All the titles. 'Surface Noise'. 'Surface Noise'. Probably my favorite... Well, everything Luke Slater did is my favorite, but Planetary Assault Systems So many great records. Hell yeah. He was like, working so hard that guy. Always something coming out. Nearly every month at one point, man. It has that kind of Cari Lekebusch vibe. Yeah, that one sound, that: That dubby thing. I know that sound from Cari for sure. It's like a trademark sound of his. I think it's Cari Lekebusch. Could be Cari Lekebusch. That's definitely Cari Lekebusch. Cari Lekebusch. And he taught all of the Swedish guys to make music. In the beginning Cari Lekebusch The Papa of Sweden. Title? We don't know. Dammit, I wish I knew titles. Like I say. No title, unfortunately. That's the thing. When you do a Blind Test, all the names disappear. It's part of the game. Killer track. Ooh la la. I don't know what is. I don't know what is Blank page. Nice. No, I got to pass on that one. You will tell me the name and I will be like, Funk D'Void? Yeah. Funk D'Void. There you go. Sorry Lars. Funk D'Void on Soma. But again the bloody titles man... 'Bad coffee'. I have this record, I know. Yeah. 'Bad coffee'. Okay. I didn't know. Is it...? I'm scared to say but isn't that Underground Resistance? No it sounds more like Octave One to me. The drums sound quite UR- ish, but If it was UR I would probably... Yeah, I would probably know it. Sounds amazing. I love it, but I have no idea. Your choices are very difficult. You're not making it easy. You are really digging it deep on this one, aren't you? Most of us probably never played it. Are these records from your collection Holger? Or do you just pick them? Ah, from your collection, ok. You did a Blind Test for yourself? Yeah, great. Next time I do a Blind Test for you. Sounds great. Sorry!
