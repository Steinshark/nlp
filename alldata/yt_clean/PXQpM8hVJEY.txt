And I was wondering if there to incorporate this so that I have a little especially as I am launching OPRAY WINFREY: Great. ARTHUR BROOKS: is that-- and by the I love entrepreneurs. I love to see the spirit. You can tell that she's so this thing going and OPRAY WINFREY: She believes. ARTHUR BROOKS: A that hope and optimism is the Optimism is a prediction. Everything's going to be great. That's what optimism is. And that's not necessarily true. If you're an entrepreneur, OPRAY WINFREY: And it's ARTHUR BROOKS: It You could be very of your business. You can be very going to happen this day, but going to be all right. ARTHUR BROOKS: Hope Hope is a declaration of action. Hope says, something can You can be a pessimistic You can be a very hopeful you know what? I'm not so sure things but there's stuff I can do to OPRAY WINFREY: That's right. I mean, hope is empowering. Hope is incredible. So if you're an optimistic about it, OK, you've had businesses. ARTHUR BROOKS: And there's and just thinking to be OK all the time is not OPRAY WINFREY: Or I believe it's going to be OK. I feel that it's ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. OPRAY WINFREY: hope that includes some ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. So the way to do that is not to today is going to be Only good things. No bad things. No, no, no, no, There's going to be good, Bring it on. Why can I say bring it on? Because there's a bunch OPRAY WINFREY: Yes. And also because as one of is to be able to accept ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. OPRAY WINFREY: And I think-- and, you know, we have a that says that happiness is our is trying, striving-- ARTHUR BROOKS: Pursuing. OPRAY WINFREY: when, in fact, we should be trying to say in this book, or is that you need the ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. OPRAY WINFREY: I think so people are like oh, oh, oh-- OPRAY WINFREY: about the balance in your life. You know, some days you wake OPRAY WINFREY: Yes. ARTHUR BROOKS: You I don't know. But then you make a that you can do this day. Make a list of the can do that will make in your business or your or the lives of other people. And that's an expression and that will make OPRAY WINFREY: So &quot;Focus Less on Yourself,&quot; and called the moral deed study. What is that? ARTHUR BROOKS: This is a study-- it's a really interesting of the work on how uses human experiments So the way that take a bunch of students-- because they'll do And you set them up and give them and see how they differ So this is one that asks, if yourself, or if you think nice or if you go out and do a nice one of those three actions will Now, left in the will be like, I'll I'll go to a spa. I'll eat the candy bar. I'll go out to dinner. I'll go have a good time, right? But they randomize the One group, go do something The other is, think beautiful And the third is, go just a random act of And then they saw how happy and also how happy And unambiguously, were the kind acts, the random That was it. That wasn't the The natural thing to do But if you basically-- nice things about other people. Think of something You know, we were talking OPRAY WINFREY: Yeah, yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: Remember I was giving this were discussing this a little bit helpless at work. ARTHUR BROOKS: You're feeling The way that you can that you don't like very or something, is to start for the people in your office. ARTHUR BROOKS: It turns out that All these experiments Look at the person and go to the break room, and of hot coffee, even though sure she likes coffee, right? ARTHUR BROOKS: And bring it back You look like you could And pretty soon, you're OPRAY WINFREY: OK. So is the reason you do something for of the other person's reaction? Or is it because it does ARTHUR BROOKS: Well, this about acts of love. You know, one of the is when people are really The best way to get To get love, give love. OPRAY WINFREY: Mm-hmm. ARTHUR BROOKS: It doesn't Go do something. What that does is it really things in your own brain. Life-- your load you're helping another person. You take the emphasis You're not looking in When, you know, woe is me, it's And I get it. Because when you're you're thinking about You get relief when Plus, you magnetize from another person. You're going to draw when you actually give it. That's the-- and again, or a little compliment. OPRAY WINFREY: You And I love this. Is that if I was at and I used to love to, like, you know, tell pay for the next person in line. And I never knew or what-- but I just know the person puts and they say, oh, the groceries that for the rest of the that thing happened to them. OPRAY WINFREY: Yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: and they're still telling the that paid for their pork chops. [LAUGHTER] No, but it's a beautiful thing. OPRAY WINFREY: Yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: And the truth who knows? Is it the hand of God? I've done tons of There's a funny thing that I as a social scientist. I found that, for example, this weird thing, this mystery-- that when people gave money they made more money. It's a weird thing. It's like, it And I think, something's OPRAY WINFREY: It's ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, right. But it was like, they after they gave money away. And it was like, it if that makes sense. ARTHUR BROOKS: So I go to this at the university with me. I was-- as an in a slightly different field. I was like, I have I keep finding that when you get richer. And he's like, oh, we've I said, well, tell me more. ARTHUR BROOKS: He said-- but it's trivial. He said when people give more and they're more They're more empowered. ARTHUR BROOKS: And they get OPRAY WINFREY: That makes sense. ARTHUR BROOKS: And so that the wheels of and, you know, money What happens is and you work with more joy is the bottom line. Give more, get happier. Give your time. There's actually a study-- you'll love this-- that shows they get more attractive OPRAY WINFREY: Really? Yeah, there's a study that says they're asked to come into or girlfriends. And they say that-- I'm going to give you and you just have to walk down there, and my colleague's And he's going to ask you and you go home. That's it. So they walk out and halfway through, there's an and a homeless guy Turns out he's involved in He panhandles the guy. Got any change? He does. They put the coins and he has to make a decision What is he going to do. OK, he makes the decision. They keep walking. The guy in the next did you give money And then to his do you find him right now? And it turns out, the the sexier she finds you. OPRAY WINFREY: That ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. OPRAY WINFREY: Because I ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, for sure. OPRAY WINFREY: Let's a teacher from New Jersey, in which others judge us. Brianne, let's hear it. BRIANNE: Hi, my name is Brianne. After reading the section I thought, yeah, do have to care about and how they see me, to stereotypes that from work to personal safety. My question is, how do How do I care less about what in a society that judges and can be discriminatory. OPRAY WINFREY: I thought ARTHUR BROOKS: OPRAY WINFREY: Yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: It is what people think about you. But don't go looking about how people think about. ARTHUR BROOKS: The big problem You know, Teddy Roosevelt, said that comparison You know, it was a And so the whole comparing yourself with does that person think of me? What does that Sometimes it's necessary. If that person is looking that might be a threat. I have to-- I should care and my style of work. Those things are necessary, And we're evolved to But stop looking for that are totally gratuitous. How many likes did I get What are people saying about Stop asking people That's a really because, these are just looking It'll make you nuts. OPRAY WINFREY: And I think work what looks good for you. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. OPRAY WINFREY: And when you know I used to say this all the time, that if you go shopping about a pair of shoes you can ask everybody, What do you think? But when you're sure, ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. OPRAY WINFREY: When you're ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, yeah. And the happier you you're soliciting. ARTHUR BROOKS: you're really feeling kind of-- You have to ask ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, you So, you know, what do you think? Did I do a good job? I find myself doing And when you're more you're doing that less OPRAY WINFREY: Yes. ARTHUR BROOKS: It's I tell you the most for me is I want my I really do. It's really-- it's She's watching. OPRAY WINFREY: And she's proud. You just blushed. ARTHUR BROOKS: I know, But you know, when I'm most I'm not asking. I'm not seeking. I'm not grasping all the time. This is the key thing. When people feel has been somehow diminished-- OPRAY WINFREY: You're long have you been married? OPRAY WINFREY: Pretty ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, no it's-- well, it beats OPRAY WINFREY: Yolanda of six from Kenosha, Wisconsin. ARTHUR BROOKS: She has a question about envy. YOLANDA: Hi, Oprah. Hi, Arthur. Thank you so much between scholarly articles and I struggle with that you wrote was so and how not to water But I do have to declare because I don't struggle or their successes-- a little bit of their success-- but because of their and their ability to lead teams. Do you have any OPRAY WINFREY: Well, before you I want to say give and hug, because if you're I don't know how you compare else is doing to that. Because they're not They're not dealing I mean, that alone deserves ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, totally. I mean, and yeah, OPRAY WINFREY: Yes. ARTHUR BROOKS: You're You're a CEO. That's right. ARTHUR BROOKS: It's phenomenal. Plus, you know, she's got this is a source of discomfort. Most people are and they don't even know They think they actually They need to get more money. They need to get ahead. Or, even worse, they need And then they'll feel better. ARTHUR BROOKS: That's when over a big part of their life. Envy is a naturally Envy is a way that ourselves to others our own place in the hierarchy. And we want to be of ambition about doing better. And the way that we do that And say, well, that They got this quality, whatever it happens to be. I want those things. I would really And that envy-- it spurs And that's the reason OPRAY WINFREY: Isn't envy, I should. ARTHUR BROOKS: Well, that's and that's what OPRAY WINFREY: Yeah, a difference between ARTHUR BROOKS: Well, there's a and malignant envy, Benign envy is like, look, But I didn't think OPRAY WINFREY: Yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: The problem or malicious envy-- OPRAY WINFREY: Which is and so much social ARTHUR BROOKS: Well, that's so much when the mighty fall. ARTHUR BROOKS: kind of schadenfreude they get. And that's a really bad thing it's horrible for the So that the medieval as one of the deadly sins. OPRAY WINFREY: I can ARTHUR BROOKS: And by the about it, not just one. It's like, don't do that. Don't covet, right? That's envy. OPRAY WINFREY: Thy neighbor's or anything. OPRAY WINFREY: Yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: But like, don't covet social media following. I mean, you know, for the but it's all the same principle. There's a heavenly virtue talked about that OPRAY WINFREY: And that is-- ARTHUR BROOKS: Admiration. Admiration. OPRAY WINFREY: Yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: And giving It's so beautiful when you-- OPRAY WINFREY: I don't envy to admiration though. ARTHUR BROOKS: Well, It's based on It's either based on jealousy or admiration. When there's a benign envy-- it cut at you. It can make you feel less. OPRAY WINFREY: OK. Oh, I get it. The baseline is admiration. ARTHUR BROOKS: Right. OPRAY WINFREY: But because you to whatever that is-- ARTHUR BROOKS: You OPRAY WINFREY: You the thing that you would were a full whole person-- OPRAY WINFREY: Becomes ARTHUR BROOKS: So instead admire the fact that the other And then it becomes a gift. You can actually into the gift of admiration. Now, you can't do that when It's a celebrity OPRAY WINFREY: ARTHUR BROOKS: Stop following because all they'll do It's this global comparison. OPRAY WINFREY: Yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: But you maybe, for the next door that her kids are so or the fact that your he just got a big Express that as admiration, is unbelievable. I admire that so much. I would love that. I just want you to know OPRAY WINFREY: But to Yolanda's question, because their ability to manage when you're already doing it. ARTHUR BROOKS: I know, I know. I mean, this is the key thing. OPRAY WINFREY: Doing ARTHUR BROOKS: And the OPRAY WINFREY: They ARTHUR BROOKS: And she doesn't see them at home. OPRAY WINFREY: You're ARTHUR BROOKS: And they're weeping thinking, if only I had I mean, this is that everybody admires else for what they have. But if there's something that's maybe there is somebody these incredible the ability to keep chaos-- or calm in the face of chaos. Go to that person and say, I admire that. And once you do that, you've like, it's this transformation. OPRAY WINFREY: ARTHUR BROOKS: Right. They're not going another person who admires me. OPRAY WINFREY: No, no, no. And if you can turn that it's just-- it's soul changing. OPRAY WINFREY: Well, yes. The same thing, because one was she envied their ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. OPRAY WINFREY: Do you ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. I mean, the truth is that actually want their advice. Because, you know, and the and then you say-- OPRAY WINFREY: And Yeah, the person would I envy that you're and you're still ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, totally. And the fact that she's to recognize that somebody I mean, she's got I mean, Yolanda's got and she still wants Good for her. OPRAY WINFREY: You know, I used I used to call it the I said yes all the time actually know how to say no. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. OPRAY WINFREY: And explain is that after a while, I would and I'd be at an event, Like, what am I doing here? And why did I say yes to this? And blah, blah, blah. Explain why is the opposite of service ARTHUR BROOKS: So of ways to say yes to people. There's a yes that you say and there's a yes that OPRAY WINFREY: OK. ARTHUR BROOKS: Always say yes not because you're Not because you're To be a pleaser is to OPRAY WINFREY: Yes. Will you love me now if The answer is no, by the way. The answer is no. OPRAY WINFREY: They ARTHUR BROOKS: No. If you're going to they'll appreciate not going to love you more. And this happens OPRAY WINFREY: And and then they'll ask said it the first time. ARTHUR BROOKS: And they're want approbation, and and we all want the We want that. And one of the ways that we try to trade for it. ARTHUR BROOKS: And that's When you're doing something out make sure that it's whether you get OPRAY WINFREY: One of the things is the first of the pillars. We were talk about this Followed by friendship, followed Brendan is going to kick off He's a doctoral BRENDAN: Hi. I'm Brendan, and I love the talks about the four pillars. And I've been thinking when you talk about and unmet expectations. And I think my question for for people that have of these pillars, but are really in particular. Do you think that they should in order to be happier? Or should they try so to speak, on to then get more of these techniques and advice ARTHUR BROOKS: Good question. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, struggle with their I mean a lot of people are I know. It would be great if I that looked like a stepped OPRAY WINFREY: Yes. ARTHUR BROOKS: Everybody's and going sailing or whatever and it sounds like a complete because they'd be, you I get it. And a lot of people have a lot from their family. It's been a long had a healthy relationship. OPRAY WINFREY: And also trouble ARTHUR BROOKS: Completely. Yeah, for sure. OPRAY WINFREY: Instead of or expected you to be. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. Working on the pillar mean immediate, This is the thing. You know, there's lots of things We should eat right, we We should, you know, we That doesn't mean that be able to run a marathon. It doesn't mean that OPRAY WINFREY: And that just because you reached out. ARTHUR BROOKS: You and you need to start You know, people ask me, you in a fitness journey? And the answer is, get up off OPRAY WINFREY: Yeah. Go walk around for half an hour. That's the beginning So the version of that for a that's freighted and is to take down the and basically, Just make it easy. Don't have any expectations Just be open. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, I mean, it's like you don't that everything's going OPRAY WINFREY: I I think-- Brendan, key-- is when you start to relationships to have no expectation for you're willing to accept that, ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, I mean, if my mother isn't then I have no relationship, That's wrong. You know, if you've had a lot call up mom, and say, Just like any other person talked to in a little while. Yeah, yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: And just don't be is the whole-- do it, but OPRAY WINFREY: So small and work your way up. ARTHUR BROOKS: Start small, OPRAY WINFREY: Lower ARTHUR BROOKS: That's right. OPRAY WINFREY: And just let coming from a space of love. OPRAY WINFREY: And ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. You're going to going to give this thing. You're going to Maybe not. And the whole point than not having had the probably. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. OPRAY WINFREY: And you because you made the effort. Totally. I mean, I know you're going you were a kid, and this thing, but just let it go for a minute. Let it go for a minute. OPRAY WINFREY: Holding when you were a kid when a kid-- that is just crazy. ARTHUR BROOKS: Well, you wrote OPRAY WINFREY: Yes. ARTHUR BROOKS: I mean, it's that talks about know all the-- OPRAY WINFREY: Things What happened to you. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. And everybody should I mean, you're carrying with you. And you actually have permission You don't have to carry all OPRAY WINFREY: ARTHUR BROOKS: But people And it's also the anger and A lot of the time that is so bad because all those and really, what's going on And just let go.

As someone who's one of the and isn't quite as strong in the presence of the family, any other things I us all to understand happier as a family unit. ARTHUR BROOKS: That's OPRAY WINFREY: Mm-hmm. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, of the family, they have this right? Because bigger you know, stronger order, yada, yada, yada. My little girl, my is relatively She's an introvert, of ultra-extroverted people. I mean, you've met-- I mean, they're just like-- rah! And it bothered her at first, effective at being glue-- connective tissue in our family. And the way that she did in Congress. So what you find is that that are the loud mouths-- always giving the They're always they're giving a speech usually, on C-SPAN or something OPRAY WINFREY: Yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: But who do all the talking. Then there are the ones who the quieter personalities. Those are the ones getting a lot done, and the way They do it with They're not trying to fight OPRAY WINFREY: This is good. ARTHUR BROOKS: So Emily can be that effective by actually resolving conflict, one to one to one to one. And it can turn out they get to the family solved the problem beforehand. That's what I recommend. OPRAY WINFREY: ARTHUR BROOKS: That's her sphere of who speaks very, very softly-- is to do it in a which, by the way, creates OPRAY WINFREY: Really? Because, you know, when as opposed to just having a it's better. OPRAY WINFREY: Here's of our readers, Kathleen. Kathleen? KATHLEEN: This is Kathleen. You know, I was really the discussion on You talk about how and move towards compassion. So could you break the differences between and how we should pursue relationships in our lives and ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, You know, we've talked write about this in the book. Everybody wants Everybody thinks empathy That's not right. Empathy, according to is an overrated virtue. It doesn't mean you shouldn't But the problem is that we're pain, and they need even something they don't like. Usually, the worst are super empathetic, right? It's like, oh, I feel your pain. Like, you're not their friend. You're the parent. A good parent is meaning that you got to do of the other person even though they don't like it. So compassion has an element of but then it goes the problem to tolerating the Acting is really what This is the thing. When you have teenage you say, I've got that he's not going to like. I got to do something But if I don't do it, I'm I'm not being a good father. We have a way of doing that to compassion in my house. My wife came up with suffered through a lot And it would be-- we talked about my son Carlos. And my wife would say-- in her you have a problem with Carlos. How can I help? And what she was to put compassion on her heart, the empathy that was coming from It was incredibly Empathy is feeling. Compassion is action. OPRAY WINFREY: Well, I connected with a phrase that &quot;emotional ATM.&quot; Explain that. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I work a lot. You know, my students are My MBA students at the business And a lot of them of a version of a relationship that stems from or one-directional kind they were little kids. When your kids are little, you They're not giving you emotional They're not making dinner And the result is a kind of a one-way valve and the kids take. Now, that evolves. It's not like they have when you're 28 years old. But there's kind of kind of transactional, The best way when people or kind of an incomplete parents, is asking treating my parents like an emotional ATM machine? Am I always asking When I call up, is So did you did you get How are you feeling today? You got your winter Do you think you're And the reason for one way, one way, one way. And breaking that down not what am I asking them for-- emotional support or can I do for them? How can I take interest in You'll freak them You'll freak out start taking interest because they'll be like-- what's going on here? OPRAY WINFREY: What do you want? ARTHUR BROOKS: You know, But that turns out to shut and it can get you into a with another adult. OPRAY WINFREY: One of the I know is forgiveness. Almost all unresolved comes down to ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, for sure. OPRAY WINFREY: So the each other, explicitly is extremely important. Walk us through the four if you will. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. You know, forgiveness and by the way, it's hard. The person who benefits is the forgiver. There's a ton of The Buddha said that hatred to throw at somebody. The person who's is the person who has And refusing to forgive letting go of the coal. It's just going to burn you I mean, you need relief. That's good. ARTHUR BROOKS: I OPRAY WINFREY: Good, Buddha. Even if the person doesn't OPRAY WINFREY: Get rid of ARTHUR BROOKS: Because It's hurting you. ARTHUR BROOKS: But then you have of forgiveness on the gravity of the offense and a whole bunch of things. So we go through this-- of forgiveness. And forgiveness can be and airing of a particular You know, forgiveness can come conflict and talking about it. That's actually a Forgiveness can be as something go, and minimize it. It's called minimization. Minimization is where you that you don't care anymore. You don't have to say anything. It's like, it's all good. It's all good. And you know it's being I'm being nice to you OPRAY WINFREY: Yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: But if then you actually have to which is to say-- ARTHUR BROOKS: I forgive you. ARTHUR BROOKS: I forgive you. To actually say, I And that requires that somebody And that's super important. And you've got to have techniques in your arsenal. And there's a whole that shows when things are You know, in couples that minimization is OPRAY WINFREY: No. ARTHUR BROOKS: You need the OPRAY WINFREY: who went through because they were betrayed. The person not but brought the ARTHUR BROOKS: Oof. OPRAY WINFREY: And-- I said-- OPRAY WINFREY: Total. I said, that's a ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, yeah. OPRAY WINFREY: And when they she tried to get back He said, I don't want And I said then, because you've got to be ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, yeah. OPRAY WINFREY: And there has ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, of intimacy in that situation. OPRAY WINFREY: Yes. ARTHUR BROOKS: You know, Actual conflict between partners is one of the most intimate And one of the things that to couples is that they learn fight a lot more. This is really and they're fighting overtly. Now, it's actually when you're married, you have OPRAY WINFREY: Yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: You my wife is Spanish. And, you know, like is a form of simple And I was aggrieved years of my marriage. I was hurt a lot. But, you know, you OPRAY WINFREY: Because it ARTHUR BROOKS: It I couldn't handle it. We don't do that. You know, it's like, you know? [LAUGHTER] But now I actually understand, I've studied this a great require forgiveness that it can be the most intimate OPRAY WINFREY: I love that. ARTHUR BROOKS: OPRAY WINFREY: I'm from Seattle. We don't do that. ARTHUR BROOKS: Like, why I'm not yelling. I'm not yelling. But the truth is that you should you know, forgiveness, as an opportunity to become Because you don't get to And to say the truth is the most intimate thing. You know, couples would be and love toward each other. We're so intimate with each I guess we're just making up. You were more genuine than you've been OPRAY WINFREY: I get that.
