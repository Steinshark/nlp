AI has blown up over the past AI, machine learning, neural networks, and so Well, let's start at the top. ### 1. Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence is the broad to do things that require human systems that can perform human-like tasks such and making decisions. It's like an umbrella that ### 2. Machine Learning Machine learning, AKA ML, is the It is a subset of AI focused on creating from data and improve on their own, ### 3. Training The process of teaching a program how to learn is and told what patterns to look for. After it that it needs to find patterns on its own, ### 4. Model These ML programs that are learning to model is like the brain of the ML system, making ### 5. Neural Network Speaking of brains, neural networks are a common They consist of layers of decision-makers called work together to recognize patterns in data. Ever That's a neural network in action, identifying ### 6. Deep Learning When these neural networks have many layers, allow the network to learn even more from large amounts of data. Deep learning is where understanding intricate details is crucial. ### 7. Gen AI It's one thing to learn from data, and Deep learning's powerful capabilities which are models that can create new content ### 8. Natural Language Processing Conversations are complex though, as language field dedicated to developing the interaction called natural language processing, AKA NLP. interpret, and generate human-like language, ### 9. Large Language Models In fact, language is so complex that called large language models, AKA LLMs. And, because ChatGPT, and other products ### 10. Code Completion Assistants (Codeium) LLMs are not just limited to generating called code completion assistants, like generating completely functional code. which sucks for deve- wait what's that? There's a performance than the paid ones? That's right, which is why I'm so excited that Codeium is a completely FREE that integrates with your codebases to hypercharge favourite code editor, and all you need to do is coding assistant that will generate code for explain, and generate docs for existing code, codebase and has context awareness. It will as well as your Git repo, and for even And again, it's COMPLETELY FREE! the link in my description and watch ### 11. Training Data Now, all of these models we've but what do we actually train them with? Well, if and we want our ML models to be ferrari-level Training data can be anything. ### 12. Features How does the model actually know what it what features are important this might be certain words or phrases, whereas ### 13. Labels This data we're providing can either data just means we are telling the model what the If we gave our model photos of random animals, would also come with the name of the animal so ### 14. Supervised Learning In fact, this is one of the most common learning. Supervised learning is when the and tries to find the patterns in this data. ### 15. Classification One of the most common types of supervised classification, the model predicts a discrete means there are a finite number of values, and detecting spam mail. In this case, there ### 16. Regression The other most common type of supervised the model predicts a continuous output value continuous means that there are infinite values, which is why regression is used in ### 17. Unsupervised Learning Now you may be wondering - if supervised is UNsupervised learning when we give the model the back, because that's exactly what it is. necessarily know what to make of the data, and we ### 18. Clustering One way it finds patterns is the model tries to make groupings of data clustering can be used to segment customers purchasing behavior, or to group similar ### 19. Association Another unsupervised learning technique the model tries to find items that such as looking at what types of items ### 20. Reinforcement Learning Another common type of learning is reinforcement error, receiving rewards or penalties based on its good behavior. A great example of reinforcement like chess. It plays millions of games, trying it gets rewarded - if a move leads ### 21. Fairness and Bias Sometimes, machines can get carried away with is why a crucial concept in AI is fairness and biases present in the training data. It's this, as it can lead to incorrect faults, and ### 22. Model Evaluation After training a model, we want to know unseen data. There are so many model evaluation For now, just know that generally, evaluation model run through it to see how well it does ### 23. Computer Vision For these last 3 concepts, I wanted to explain what I think are 3 of The first one is computer vision. Computer make decisions based on visual data. This autonomous vehicles, and even medical ### 24. AGI Another fast growing field is Artificial AI is mostly what we call "narrow", meaning most AGI aims to perform any intellectual it could be used to analyze data create convincing legal arguments, and ### 25. XAI Sounds cool, but a bit scary right? has grown a lot in the past couple years. how it thinks, as well as validate that its becomes more integral in society, especially it's important to know that After all, we don't want a ### Conclusion Thanks so much for watching!
