Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Everyday 2 This is the second channel, where I go deeper into the subject matter and I'm going to show you something I am taking you to Finland today, So you may or may not know that Film is something that people quit and now people are using it But there's this problem. You've got these old cameras and nineties and early, 2000s even, And people want them. So what do you do? Do you go find a broken one and fix it? Well, there's this organization in Finland project, which also has something They are these people that They'll buy it from somebody And this is what's part of what's called we have a product It got used for a while, and it needs to be fixed. And we inject new life into it and It's a really interesting concept, and the guy that started this organization His name is Juho. Yeah, Yeah. So a circular economy is a really I feel like things need to be used Okay. It's a it's a really interesting thing So here's what I'd like to show you. I'm--you're basically going to explain We're in the city where you're from. Tampere Tampere. E or A? E r e - Tampere. So we're going to go to Tampere and we're going to see the business Jussi - who you will meet. They set this up and they're breathing And even if you're not a photographer I think you will find this interesting called the circular economy. And this is a thing that's Would you agree? It's it's blowing up in Europe. So in the US it's going to come soon. It's going to happen? Yeah. All right. Let's go to Finland and let's learn about the camera store I say that, right? Yeah. Okay, cool. Let's check it out. In this video, you're going to see things like us looking at all You're going to hear the philosophy You're even going to see a film There's a lot of really cool stuff Hey, it's me, Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day And today we're going to see more analog film cameras At least that's my understanding. Let's give it a shot. You guys work at camera rescue? I'm more of a student or intern, Oh, so you work on the cameras? Awesome. Very cool. So you guys are working on analog? I'm filming, obviously. Yeah. Yeah. So there it is. Kamerastore. Here we go. Video recording in progress. That's funny. Thank you. Hello? How's it going? What's up, man? As if we don't know each other. I've been hanging out with Juho here [J] Yes, the first thing first in Finland. Coffee? [D] Yes. [J] Do you want to drink from a Canon mug? [D] It doesn't matter. I'll drink from it. [J] The most Finnish mug is this old military mug. [J] This used to be [D] Oh, yeah. That's the one then, huh? [J] Fotosidan. [D] That's a Swedish magazine. [J] Yeah, it's. Like a photographic magazine in Sweden. And they came in to visit in May. And they did. [D] Oh, look at you. We had different hair then. Look at that. [J] I was clean. Not in the middle of summer. Yeah. Now I have that kind of [D] Scrugglies [J] Yes, but they did an article about the school, and about testing cameras and. [D] How you do it. Yeah. So this right here, This is a machine Mm hmm. This is a way Yeah, I'm excited to see that. So what do you. What do you guys do here? [J] We basically we used to be just a store but nowadays we try to save analog photography And by that we focus on cameras because there's obviously Kodak, And then there's others developing or doing the chemistry side. But there isn't that many players camera knowhow for the next generations. So we have a school, source cameras and we source spare little Noah's Ark for analog cameras. Yeah, Yeah. Here in Tampere Finland, so. [D] So Juho is sandbagging just a little bit. This man is smart and he is You actually did an analysis to figure out [J] Yeah. [D] So cameras are strategic for you. Or the mainly when when I did analog photography has a future and can I create jobs for people depend for there to be analog photography having a future for decades. Because if you are starting you don't want to do it for two years. and there is a hype for analog photography So that was the main purpose of doing this #saveanalogcameras survey that we did in both in 2017 and 2020. [D] You did . . . so you did a survey. And you figured out film People were still going to shoot [J] Yeah, no one was making cameras looking out so that there would be cameras All of the master technicians were over Most of them didn't have a master-pupil-- [D] Mentorship. [J] Mentorship, status So the knowhow was bleeding out fast and almost got extinct, [D] So you're trying to fight the brain [J] Yes. Yes. And and also, like, there's there's things like manuals And this is a complicated world obviously kept their knowledge to the very end. There was very few, uh, or there were no official places [D] Yeah. [J] And now we are kind of reverse engineering and we have old masters who have, have these brands, and we're trying to get being factory trained by an old master. [D] So, so I actually dropped one of my old analog film So I went in [D] And he repaired my camera. So you have people like that [J] Well, not yet, but we have for, I think, six or seven brands, a factory trained person so thats quite a lot. [D] It's a big it's a big deal. [J] Yeah. Yeah. [D] Do you have all the crazy cameras [J] Well, yeah, we have those too. [D] Yeah. [J] So we could do a little tour. I can. And there's things in three [D] Okay. [J] So there's a lot to see. Do you want to go around Like, if a camera would arrive, would would you like to go through that route, [D] Is that is that typically how you do it? [J] That's kind of typically how we do it. [D] Mm hmm. [J] And that ends up in the showroom that you want to play with. [D] Yeah. [J] But that. Yeah, there's steps in between. Okay, so our whole idea here with the And I have a list here. So the first thing you do Yeah. Otherwise, Okay. So you have some kind of diagnostics Yes, for cameras. It's. It's obvious that there's How do you test clothes in the circular economy? So. So these these things that we're talking about here Yeah. It's So you have identify, testing, repairs So spare parts or if you can't repair it, Yeah. Okay. And then you list it and you sell it, Yeah. Okay, So these are the steps And we're going to show how these are And we'll show them on the screen as we're [D] Okay. Wow. So this looks like my house. [J] So this is basically where cameras arrive. [D] Uh, most of these are analog. [J] Yes. [D] Wow. So I purchased, like, six of these recently, [J] So this is a spare parts bin. [D] So TLR, twin lens reflex analog camera Then you've got the old point and shoot [J] Yeah. [D] Wow. [J] So these are all going down I'll show you our spare parts collection. So these have been deemed to be, you know, broken in some sort of way They been given a barcode So then if someone would start, for example, repairing Yashica MG-1s, 30, 50 spare part bodies downstairs. And then he can check like, okay, I want to start with the ones with a light and I can get all of them together and do them as a batch, you know, figuring out stuff one camera We try to figure out one one camera but then have 50 of the same doing a bit batch work. [D] I have I have this exact thing in my my house. What is that? That long thing. No, the other one. Yeah. It's not to much for a Nikon. [A] It's a Canon F-1 The old one. [D] So it's just a really, really big spool. [A] 250. 250 photos. So it is . . . 30 feet? [J] Yeah. It was mainly for use, they use it for school photos. Anything that you wouldn't you would put one of those. [A] 250 frames. [D] And so [A] This is probably second one I'm seeing. [D] Really. [D] So it's a pretty, and then you have to figure out [A] This is probably worth selling. The matter is When are we going to Yeah, 'cause not everyone wants this. [D] What was your name again? [A] Aki. [D] I'm Destin. Nice to meet you. So you pay people. You pay people for these cameras? [A] Yeah. We buy cameras in [D] Okay, so you're not just taking in cameras You're actually buying these cameras? [A] Well, you're starting here, the whole process through So I'm not buying anything. I'm just, people send us offers and I just open them up [D] Got it. [A] After they're checked, for the actual offer without checking the items &quot;It's perfect.&quot; Yeah, usually it's not. And people say it's bad. And we need to figure out, we can offer more or offer less. [D] Okay, sounds good. Well, can you put notes on the cameras in your system? [A] You really want to have this. [D] Yeah, I'm serious. [A] You could actually take it with you... [D] I'm making it weird. [J] We can take it to cleaning and then to the pricing guys, [D] Okay. Yeah, let's do it. [J] We can move it forward in the process. [D] Okay, I'll take that to the next step. [A] The life of a camera. The life of a camera at Kamerastore. My name is Destin I'm Emily. [D] Emily? Emily, [E] And this actually, I just, like, stickering it and put that into the system after because, like, So this is ours now. I know. [D] Oh, you've purchased it at this point. [E] The company purchased. Not me. [D] So once you purchase it It goes in the system. [E] Yeah, this needs some repair So I will put a sticker on that and put [D] Awesome. Thank you. It's Emily, right? It's nice to meet you. Yeah. [J] So here you can see basically for example. All of these probably arrived only last week. Now they are waiting for customers to say These are only last week. Yeah. Wow. [D] How's it going? Hey, I'm Destin. Roman. Nice to meet you, Roman. are you checking them? [R] Yeah. Me and ... seven other guys. [D] How do you check a camera [R] We have testing machines. [R] Like from - I can show you. [D] This is the main checker. Is this an old machine? [R] This one is pretty new, by Kyoritsu in 2020 for us. Kyoritsu is the brand that makes them So this is our newest one With this machine you can basically check anything that cameras can do. [D] Okay, So let me. [R] Probably funnier if we... [D] Is this a flux meter? This is a light flux? [R] It's kind of a sensor like movement, curtainspeed, [D] So hold on. So there's a shutter. So this goes behind the camera? [R] I guess this will be easier [D] Yeah, that'll be good. Yeah, it'd be easier. For the sake of showing. [R] So this is the camera. [D] Hey, I'm Destin. [L] Lauri. [D] Laurdi. Nice to meet you. How did I do? Finnish. Finnish Did I do Okay? [L] No, no. [D] I tried, I'm sorry. [R] So dependent on whatever camera it is - you choose correct settings [D] Oh, the time in milliseconds. And this is the curtain speed. This is the overall exposure time. [R] The exposure time. [R] So this supposed and it looks more like 500th. [D] Oh, that's.. Okay, so you're setting the camera. So you set the camera to a thousand frames So one millisecond. [R] Yep. And it shows me. [D] Two point two milliseconds. [R] Which is, according to our tolerances [D] Can I see your chart? So. Okay, so let me let me just make sure So the camera has a shutter. It's actually a curtain. Can I see the curtain operate? [R] Depends on the camera. I can put it like a bit slower. So it's. [D] Yeah. So that is the curtain on on the film [R] Mm hmm. [D] So you are putting this in the [R] Mm hmm. [D] All right. And then you are. Can we do that [R] So this is this a test lens. [D] Uh huh. [R] So depending on the different machines, [D] So is there no aperture in there? [R] Oh, no, there is an aperture. So you can also test like... [D] just open? [D] Okay. And so you put. [R] One for the shutter. You need this wide open for this machine. [D] Okay, so can I test something? So if I want 1/60 of a second, I would expect 16 milliseconds, 16.6 and actually 19.2. [R] Which is okay. [D] That's okay? So what's your [R] It's around 30%. [D] 30%, really so there's there's some forgiveness there. [R] Yeah. Because like 30% will give you one third of a stop. 1/3 of a stop even for slide [D] Yeah. Okay. [R] And pretty much you should know that this camera was made 50 years ago. [D] Yeah. [R] Probably will not be like exactly perfect. Even from the factory [D] Let me ask you this. I have a question. So if if I were to take this camera and if I were mechanically knowledgeable of this camera could you apply some oil or lubrication [R] That's not exactly how it's supposed to be. But we are servicing this model. So it's possible to service, - put like a bit of oil - close So it will take at least a bit more complicated disassembly cleaning and. Lubricating. [D] Really? So you have to disassemble [R] Not exactly whole whole. You don't need to break this it was from the factory, than just - pick [D] Really? That's amazing. And so. Huh. So this how many of these machines [R] Quite a few, actually. [D] Really? [R] I don't really know the exact number... is this from a factory [R] I mean this one - [D] I'm noticing the hardware is like the, [R] You can, you can see. On the other side. [D] Can we rotate this way. [R] A little bit. We can do it. Rotate. Let me see. Yeah. Here it this. And that's the date of the factory So this , this one was calibrated by Kyoritsu in 2020. [D] 2020? [R] It's the newest I guess, existing. [D] That's pretty new. Good catch. [J] We have a 1977 one over there, 1983 one over there still in use too. [D] That's amazing. [R] That you can see. There. [D] Okay. So you just got these cameras here and if they're... I understand how to do this with a shutter [R] Yeah. [R] It's the same, exposure on the different EV settings.. [D] So yeah, yeah, yeah. Show me on a point and shoot. Ah. [R] We need a point and shoot. But yeah. So [D] That's the shutter timing? [R] No, no, no. That's the light values - exposure values. [D] I'm sorry. I don't understand. So. So you're LV setting? [R] Yeah. [D] Light value. [R] Yeah. [D] So you put the camera in front. Actually have a camera in my pocket. Can I show you a camera that I have? So I have. If its still here. Mm hmm. That's a good one. Yeah. So I have Mju. [D] There is not film inside. [R] Okay then we can just check it. [D] I got this from the Ukraine Okay, so I have a mju. This is a good camera. And these are [R] Yeah, that's true.. Okay. [D] Okay, so. [R] Are you sure you have a good battery? [D] I do have a good battery. Yes. [R] Let's check with your battery. Okay. [D] You see, you can see my one problem Is broken here. [R] Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of quite common. [D] For that model? [R] Yeah, it just with any models actually. There is a lot of them, which - like [D] Yeah. So how would? So this is a this is a point and shoot camera [R] We already check that flash is working Um the empty cassette can be used to think that it's 100 ISO now. [D] Okay, so hold on. Let me. You're you're going fast. So this is the DX code And so you're tricking the camera using those little metallic pads. [R] That is 100 ISO. That's exactly what my machine has said. [D] You set your machine to 100 ISO. Okay. [R] This one, overall exposure setting - Sensor in. [you here the sound of the shutter open and close [R] I guess your camera's underexposing slightly. [D] Really. [R] Again, with the negative film, it's pretty much OK. Its around one stop. [D] Okay, so I have a question, Roman. So there's light in this room and so so is the light this window here, Is it affecting this [R] That depends on where is the light's It's there. Mm hmm. As you can. The light from the window [D] Okay, So. So I have a Mju that's underexposing. And if so, how would. What would you do? Would this be rejected? [R] Technically, yes. It's like one stop is a little bit I mean, if your shoot slide film With the negative film its still ok. [D] I did a roll of slide film yesterday [R] That was okay? [R] It probably will be ok. It has some latitude and you can also do So it should be fine... but through our process [D] So this would be rejected by you. [R] Yes. Sorry.. Roman has rejected my camera [Destin giggles] So what can I do? [R] You just use it. It's a OK camera. [D] Yeah? [R] And you're saying film winding is working? [D] Yeah. [R] That's another thing we would check, but Like, first of all, it's Battery door would need to be changed. Overall exposure is like minus one EV. [D] I paid $200 for it. How did I do? [R] I guess that's how it works. But it is still very usable I just don't think we can sell it as like [D] So on a on a camera like this electronics internals, [R] Oh well. Probably you can, I just don't [D] Okay, I see. So this one would be sold or you would reject it outright? [R] I would say without changing the battery [D] Do you have any old. [R] Yeah. We have like a bunch of spare parts. [D] Can I. Can I buy a battery door from you guys? [R] Oh, that's more for these... For somebody else. I'm not selling cameras - [D] Okay, So. So Roman's job, Roman checks them, and then we move on Okay. [R] It depends on what the checking says. It will either be like repairs, or further up the process to the listing. We try to clean the stuff straight [D] Okay. Thank you very much Roman. Nice to meet you, man. So you're going through each little Uhh cleaning. What do you what do you start with? [J] First like it's some alcohol based foam. [D] Okay, go for it, man. [J] Basically, I already did. [D] Oh, you already? You're done. [J] No, I'm not. Not entirely done. About the clean all the plastic parts. [D] Let's go for it. [J] And then just. [D] I'll just watch. [sounds of air nozzles blowing [J] So now it's as clean as it can get. Because it's been through. Years of wear and tear so some scratches Then there's only the viewfinder window. [D] Hmm. So you go through a lot of Kim wipes. [J] Yeah, Sometimes more. Sometimes less. If not, have a great week, enjoy!. [Chairs scraping the floor as people get up to leave] Right that was the weekly meeting . I learned a lot that I won't tell you, Every week you do this? That. [J] Yeah. Every week . . . Every week at 10:00 about as much communication [Destin Laughing] And it's on Monday so that people are very well rested after the weekend [D] Why was it why was it in English? [J] Oh, half of the people are now so we have started to have these The company is starting to be in English [D] Yeah. [J] We have a super odd language, So we cant expect people to learn it [D] Yeah. And so when you say people [J] At the moment the furthest is Japanese, and then there is two, three, three Americans [D] Jussi! I have a question for you is that okay? [J] So three Americans, uh, one Russian, one Greek, one uh, one originally from Vietnam, but now living already ten years in Finland. [D] So it's a very international company. [J] Danish and Norwegian Swede. So we have the whole Nordics. But yeah, yeah, we have, uh, I'm going to let Juho introduce us to Jussi is my best buddy And you guys started the company together? Yeah, we did that later on. Ok Jussi is the CEO. I'm about to introduce you. [D] So. So you're in charge of the company? [J] Yes, I am. All right, So. So this is Jussi He taught me a lot about spin. Yesterday was really good. So you and Juho are friends? Yes. Well, that's how we started. We were neighbors when we were like And. Well, then we grew up as friends and back to Finland. But then Juho moved to Tampere And then he contacted me and we had seen each other a few times But then Juho told me he had a hobby buying cameras and selling cameras, should he start a business I had zero idea about cameras. But I knew something about business, which was dealing poker and doing events But then Juho asked me that since I know something about money. And then I actually saw - that, Hey, do you have old film cameras? We are buying film cameras. [D] So you kind of probed to begin with so so Juho had the vision Well kind of. But then I was surprised that each studio we have plenty of film cameras. Do you want them for free? Or if I said that we are buying them, everybody was - "Yes, So then I saw that there was actually something in this, eBay was a new thing in Finland But then film was dead. Yeah. Everybody just wanted to get and selling with two. So easy business. Yeah. Well now we have been partners for what, 12 years company. So it's quite [D] So friends first Yeah. Has it affected the friendship? [J] Well, sure, having a family. So if you have a wife, it's one thing, but once you have kids, Well, then the wife is also the mother. Juho is sort of the father. Well, I'm. I can be then the mother or whatever. But it's it's [D] So you make sure that things Yes. Yeah. And so who would you say? Are you the disciplined How does this work? [J] We still have discipline. We have Antti for discipline. I think - Juho is the chaotic father who comes like suddenly, like "Free cash He also might say something but he's just like going around And I'm then trying to trust that But I try not to say that too much. And then we have the third one, Antti, Yeah. Having the whip and then every day, I'm just a captain in my cabin and Juho But still, Juho is the one who knows, [D] But it works out. [J] Well, we are, like, totally different. Yeah. Yeah, we. It's like a marriage. [D] Yeah, a business marriage? [J] Yeah. Yeah. I have a wife! [D] Yeah. So? So, you guys, how many years [J] 12 years of running it. 12 yeah. The first year it was just us two, (who was Antti) Now it's above 30 to take care. [D] So Jussi - What happens if Canon or Nikon that decides to make a new film What does that do I think it would be great Like people would want to do this But we are just lacking the cameras We have expensive stuff. I mean, we don't have the shortage but we have a shortage of 100 euro But if some Canon, Nikon come up or Fuji with a small like new compact camera. They would be sold everywhere, We are into professionalism if you look like what we are: Anyway, or with medium format or large format So it would be a jackpot You are a smart engineer, so you know there's tens of thousands of engineers who have spent their lives And I think currently 15,000 different So even if we have one new one it doesn't still give us the width So all of the second hand cameras and will be interesting, for that very beginner market But they are not competing There's so much R&amp;D done in decades, Yeah, [D] Because everybody's going to have Yeah you're shooting a Plaubel. Yeah. [J] Yeah. [D] So everybody's everybody's going to have their own thing So once they get into cameras they're going to find the camera And that's, that's part of It's like choosing a language worldwide. Like, yes, digital is the English But the other language are fun. They might be even more fun like ours. So essentially, Is it that small compact something huge and big and bulky photos a year - but you find it [D] Yeah. So Jussi - Juho - good dudes. [J] You get your Canon AS-1? [D] Yeah, I think so. Did we? Yeah. Where did it go? Still here? [J] Yeah. Now it's clean. [D] Now, where does it go? [J] Now it would go here. [D] Okay. Oh, that's a tiny lathe. So the thing is tiny. Look how small the lathe is.. Yeah. Wow. [J] Okay, so here would be unsorted stuff. So we would normally put it here. [D] It would just go in here? And then the so. [D] But it doesn't have a - [J] Yeah. Okay. Then the sales team would then, So they have a priority system. I guess [D] Connor. You cool explaining this? Okay. So I'm going to. I'm going to buy this camera. So can I put what's the So this goes in the highest priority [C] Yeah. [D] And then, so you're on the sales team? [C] Yes. [D] What's your name? [C] Connor. [D] And I'm trying to pick your accent. Where are you from? [C] New Jersey. [D] Really? Yeah. And you're in Finland? [C] Yeah, I came here about two years ago. [D] You love it? [C] Yeah. Happy to be here. [D] Why are you here? [C] To do this. Yeah, I worked in a similar, much smaller [D] And what was it like, KEH or ? [C] No, no, it was a... [D] That's Atlanta. [C] Now. Closed. Okay. Um, and they. Sort of recruited me to come here. I do social media [D] Really? So you love analog photography? [C] Yes. Yes, I don't. I only shoot digital for this. This is. These are the only digital cameras So what is your. [C] I have about 30 at home. I have a Canon F-1. I have a Rolleiflex that I Yeah, I'm always trying new - I've shot like used three Konica To test and find the best one that I want. Always trying new ones. Thats the joy of this job. [D] So that's why that's why [C] Yes, there is no other place like this. [D] What's it like living in Finland? [C] It's lovely. I lived in Vermont so the cold doesn't really bother me The snow doesn't bother me. It's the the darkness I mean, now it's really beautiful. There is sun all the time. Yeah. November, December. It's, you know, it's dark at 2:30. [C] you come to work. It's dark. You leave work. It's already dark. [Shutter click] [C] Wow, That's amazing. [C] Wow, That's amazing. [D] What are you shooting your digital stuff [C] Nikon full frame, D600. We have another full frame there. And it's an older model with a 60 millimeter macro lens. Pretty standard stuff just gets the job done. A couple of different angles [D] generally. Oh, so you do all the angles? Yeah. Yeah. [C] We want to show the I'll even show inside the camera, because we do redo Uh huh. This one, I don't think. But a lot of the cameras that need new light Will get new light seals. Uh huh. All right. [D] Did you shoot that manually or did you [C] It's manual. We leave it kind of at the same settings So the exposure is consistent. Yeah. But we do have to change it. You know, if the camera's really dark can be slightly problematic. We can also correct it in the next phase, [D] Oh, do you do that? [D] Oh, do you do that? [D] and you did this earlier, Sasha. [D] Sasha showed me earlier. Yeah. So Sasha is an expert in Lightroom. So yeah, everybody in this area [D] Oh, wow. [C] Listing, as we call it. So yeah, now we're in Lightroom. We can grab the photos. For that camera. And the only thing that's really important is that the entire Uh huh. Just for the sake of continuity It looks a lot better like that. I'll just ---write Canon AS-1. Yeah and we are ready to hit publish. So this just takes a second - and now. Yeah, now it should be up on the website. We'll print a label for it, So this is our label here with our barcode Shop keeping unit. That way and you can find it [D] That's awesome. And so that would go somewhere [C] I'll show you where I would bring it. [C] Right now we would bring it Under EUR100 would go to our warehouse. This goes to the showroom. Okay. Yeah, WOW! This is the showroom. So this is the showroom. I don't know if Juho wanted you [D] Well, we're here. It doesn't matter what Juho wants. [C] So we put that right on the point [C] So we put that right on the point So most of these have had some work tip top shape. [D] These are five hundreds? [C] Yeah. Yeah, a few of them. Yeah. They're all V-series. [D] I don't even know what that means. [C] The mount is the Hasselblad V mount. So it's like a 500 CM there's 503s. [D] That's awesome. Hey thank you very much. What was your name one more time? Connor. [Shutter Clicks] Cool, man. Thank you very much. You took a photo, right at the handshake. Boom. It's like we just sold a car. Well, well, I'm actually. So at this point, [C] Yeah. [D] So I got to get to your website So I will do that. Is that is that a concern? You think that one will go fast? [C] Well, we have a second one, We have two. Yeah, [D] Okay, so this one. [C] I think you will be Okay [D] Yeah. No that one, that one's not the one. It doesn't have a good, doesn't have I actually feel nervous that someone's So I'm going to do it right now Your orders been confirmed. I think you will even get a text. [J] Yep. It's here. There is your order, but on the back end Shopify app. Cool. [D] Nice, cool. [J] Now, lunch. [D] Lunch sounds. Great. [J] Jussi found a place that has meatballs to have meatballs when you are in Finland. [D] That's [D] Okay, let's go for meatballs. [J] Swedes have tried to take them [D] They're Finland thing. [J] Yeah. Okay real quick pause on the video here before we continue the tour We went and had meatballs, it was great But Destin from the future here I love the camera I use it all the time and the beautiful thing about getting it from the Kamera Store Is that it just works, I know it works, its high quality and uh, I was really surprised. The photos are incredible even though its a waterproof camera And its got the case, you know the o ring seal I thought you'd enjoy seeing some of the photos I took. So, these are some of the 35mm photos I took with this camera, after I acquiring it from Kamera Store, and I'll just let you look at these while I talk to you here. So, I took them to Peru. This is me swimming with the kids at not forgotten. We have a little pond there and all kinds of really cool stuff, We played rain soccer, that was fun. So its really cool to have a 35mm film camera, in a waterproof environment. That was really really fun and now I do and its awesome. I also took my family to a water park. We have all kinds of cool photos here I also went to a church camp that had a big cool slide. Anyway, I love these photos and I really liked just buying the camera, and it just worked. This is an old camera, really cool technology. Also, um a lot of people wonder can I get Kamera Store to ship things to me, even if I'm in the US? The answer is yes, you can. And so, I'll leave a link down in the video description With a code, if the code is still there then if you spend a certain amount of money then they will give you free shipping. If the code is not there then they are not doing that anymore but, If its there, go for it. So, Anyway I love the camera I love the process I thought you would like to see how they do this. How they vet the old technology to make sure its still good, how they clean it, and uh yeah that's it. We will now continue with the tour, and I hope you enjoy it. [D] This is a focusing tester? [J] Yeah. [D] So how does it work? [J] Well, And you would set And the things in there [D] I see. So I'd have to zoom in Hmm. And so you would do that [J] Yeah. And you would do that with any, or don't we check every lens for infinity, basically? [R] Not like every, every - Lets just say every lens. There is also another machine for that some are easier to use with this - But the process - the idea is the same. It just basically simulates infinity And also you can check the rangefinder And compare one to another. [D] Oh yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. And so all these, these are for mechanically measuring Like what on earth is this? [R] This one measures focus. [D] This measures focus? So where did you, Where did you get all of these tools? [R] That's a question for the Juho. [D] You just know how to use them [R] I hope so. [D] So you acquire the tools and people like [J] Yeah. [R] We still have manuals for most of them. For those which we don't have - that actually know how to use them. It's amazing. So Roman has a sensor behind this camera. This is a medium format camera, speed time, Right. And so here's my question. So, for example, you're changing the value So this is 1/500th. So give me a value that I can understand. So that's 1/500 of a second. Should be 2 milliseconds. [R] If you can take a look here. [D] Yeah. [R] And that'll be 500 and that'll be our, that's limits for them. And so let's see if you fire it. It's 2.43 milliseconds. [R] This is fine, but, uh, apparently this is 250 and it's not fine. [D] So, 250 should be 4 milliseconds. [R] And same with 125 [D] So 250, you should expect 4 milliseconds [R] This 125, again [D] so this. Is. [R] This is what it gives us at 250. [D] 2.7, so, so the shutter worked on 500, can you fire it please? 2.43 should have been 2 - but on 250 2.69 - (Changes shutterspeed) 125. [R] Oh there you see it now. [D] should be 8 milliseconds. So it's not consistent [R] Something is totally wrong. [D] So what do you... [R] This will go to repairs and hopefully will get back to normal. [D] So you'll say, hey, The shutter is not consistent [R] In this model So this is more like a lens problem here. [D] Oh, I see. It's amazing. All right, so where are we going now? [J] We are going to the belly of the beast. [D] What does that mean? [J] It means that we have accumulated and things [D] Assuming that the value goes up. [J] Well, not assuming anything is too difficult for it to be done economically. So value going up is a benefit, obviously. But even with the values that we started rescue project started in 2017 This building used to have a train That's why it's curved So this was a warehouse building that we could drive a train into. [D] That's fun. [J] Then the belly starts from here. [D] Okay, That's $400. [J] I don't know if you want to show your face [D] Why? Because it's a it's a lot of cameras. Okay. Yeah. [J] The belly of the beast is long And here again, your favorite Olympus So you needed this? [D] I believe I needed this part right here. This door. [J] Which is this? [D] That's a different one. Oh, yeah, it is. Yeah. [J] So I'll take this into my pocket. [D] Well, does it. That's a zoom, right? It's a Quartz date. Yeah. [D] So it'll work. [J] It might be the same. [D] So we'll take that into your pocket Oh, wow. That has been already sourced. That part. This one, too. [D] Oh, yeah. [J] You're not alone with your problem There we go. [D] Yeah, that's a good one. [J] So I think this is the right one. I put it into my pocket and let the guys [D] All right. [J] But, uh. [D] Wow. So this is... Holy cow. It's just a box of them. [J] Yes. Yes. [D] You get some random ones in there, too. [J] What's your favorite camera model? [D] I mean, like, just for film cameras? [J] Yeah. [D] I mean, I think a popular one is a Nikon [J] Yeah, that's electronic But if we go Nikon, for example, it's FM, a box of FMs, a box of FEs, another box of FEs, third box of FEs, FM2, FE2, then Nikon F two boxes of F2s and F3s, two boxes [D] Mm hmm. [J] And a very popular one is a Canon AE-1. [D] AE-1, Yeah. [J] It's Canon AE-1. We have one box, two box, three box, [D] And so [J] Well, these are also the repair queue. So it might have been that, low on the sale side for AE-1s and starts working on them [D] So this is your stock. So this is like preparing for a rainy day [J] It's partly that these cameras exist in the world The original owners are alive now. Yes, but in 20 years, how many of them will be here? [D] Where's the A1 Canon A1. [J] A1. A1, A1. Three boxes. [D] So when I pull this out. So these are, quote unquote, good cameras. Well, these are.. [J] They have something wrong with them, [D] So you could make three well, so you could take three cameras [J] Maybe. Or then then we could. I mean, most of the time it's Which stands for cleaning lubrication Which actually means and do the cleaning necessary and do the lubrication for each part And then you put it back together at every phase with the testing machines And then most cameras But the problem is that a CLA for an A-1, depending on your skill might be from 2 hours to 8 hours [D] So how do you have people that know Because I've I've repaired and you have to take this screw off to lubricate. And it's it's [J] It is very specific. And and that's not even the hard part. The hard part is that, like a good smart engineer, and put it back together and if he has a lot of time But is it put back together when the next guy goes to repair it Because a lot of the things we see do it yourself repairs, which means that or it's it is three times as cumbersome to repair it [D] Mm hmm. [J] So that's the that's the part of the problem of do it techniques and certain ways to do it So that the longevity of it is secure. [D] wow. And so you've purchased these? [J] Yeah. We've all purchased these So it's obviously for us. [D] Do you have the uh, the the Fuji GA645. [J] GA645 is again very electronic. So I'm not sure if we have any. So hopefully not. [D] Why? Because they may not work. So here's a Rollei 35. [J] Because they are quite impossible the electronic parts which nobody has. [D] I see. [J] Mechanics we can do. But if the circuits are. dead, then they are dead. Yeah. [D] And the zoom, like that's the Achilles Is the zoom and the back. [J] Yeah. We for example, I think that camera we've actually manufactured remanufactured So we can do that. And it's just a cable. So it's not.. A cable has no identity. Yes. So that kind of electrical problems [J] This way sir. Hold my coffee. We didn't have a super wide for you: Then we come here and then we see that. Well, [J] Repairing [D] Wow. [J] This is the wide angle lens, But like you saw. Oh, let's see film backs. [D] Oh, my goodness. Hasselblad film backs. Yeah. [J] Film backs or when it comes to, like, that much. But like, [D] Just a box full of Hasselblads. [J] Yes. Yeah. And these are like lenses It's not that we hoard them here just they are broken and we just don't And then again, then when we sell them, then the ones that need the least amount make them work again. [J] And when we started getting these, you know, doubling of prices So it wasn't speculative. Okay. It wasn't Yeah. And and it wasn't like Okay, we hoard stuff And that's something we get accused of everything that is sellable But these are not sellable as-is. They need love and love needs hand and hands we don't have endlessly. [D] Yeah. So these are all filmbacks. [J] Yeah. Which these, for example, are quite easy Many of our mechanics students Hasselblad film backs because it's a rather simple thing to teach, and you it's rather easy to know if it's correctly done or not. [D] Hmm. [J] We have so many types of plastic boxes here because they come from different I remember driving into to Newcastle, UK with a van [D] You drove from here to the UK? To get uh, a repair shop. It was specialized in Olympus [J] North England Olympus repairs. And then there was this. [J] And quite a lot we can pull them apart or we can manufacture newer parts, They will be really angry [D] Oh, my goodness! [J] But this is like one certain model. The parts needed. So either we have bought or we have manufactured them, And they might do like a few weeks. We ask, Why haven't you repaired anything? They say: Well, we have done this [D] That's amazing. [J] And that's the.... Manufacturing, all of this. You can imagine how much work it would be. [D] I'm just going to get some B-roll shots [J] Yeah. And this is just one model. These are custom made for one model. [D] These are new. [J] No, these are. Well, yes, they are unused. [D] That's just a little spring If you need that. If you need that spring, you don't know where to get it. [J] Yes. All right, then we look. Mamiya 645 1000s is like different parts. Different model. [D] Golly. This is. This is important. Yeah. To keep this stuff rolling. Yeah. And I can't imagine how many hours designed these in the first place. This is pen and paper, for example. Yeah. This is only for the finder. This is only for the flipping thing Yeah. But on a 645. And these are the parts for the finder. [D] Wow can I see the prism? Do we actually have the glass as well? These are just the parts. [J] That front plate. And in the PD prism, If I remember correctly. So yeah, there's some electronics parts [D] The old wiring harnesses - that's amazing. [J] Yeah. [D] So the mats. Well, yeah. Yashica. So you have a lot of 645 parts. So you guys bought you clearly bought out [J] Yeah. We have Mamiya I think we have both. Finland, Sweden and Norway's old stock, but that's still very little compared they have U.S. Mamiya old stock. [D] Tons of it. [J] Which, is 60 times as much as we would have. There somewhere in the U.S. [J] No, I mean, probably someone knows. We don't. [D] You're the last ones to know. The people that are actually doing the [J] So we might have, Yeah, that's like dead ones because nobody has sold us [D] Yeah, [D] Pentax. So a lot of a lot of SLRs. Rollei 35. Oh, okay. That's interesting. And there are various conditions like that These are all Hasselblad shutters. [J] Yeah, and full assemblies, technically. So they have no lenses, but. [D] Just the lens - the glass broke? [J] Yeah. [D] So where would you get this stuff? [J] These, for example, and the rehousing company sold [D] For a reasonable price? [J] Yes. So. So now we have technically They just don't have the glass. [D] Yeah, that's kind of an important part. [J] Yeah. Yeah. [D] Yeah. So I guess Mark G because I sent him mine [J] Yeah. And I think that's, that's, that's and partly will be focusing on just one or two models all the parts for that certain model And then there would be, you know, and he's wherever in the world that one body send to him via logistics. That the only problem with that Mm hmm. [D] Yeah, that's it. [J] Yeah. [D] So these are the the Yashica electro. [D] I have had problems with that. Actually, we repaired that one in the top. We didn't know how to index this right That, that meter or that, that dial. [J] Yeah. [D] So it's one thing to have the parts, it's quite another Which I've, I've come in to that [J] Yeah. [D] Can I take a - is this is a secret? [D] Like Can I take a picture with my phone? [J] Yeah. Okay. [D] I don't want to do anything that's not .. [J] And this is by no means a secret. It's au contraire. This is what we want the people to know [D] You want everybody to know [J] Well, we want everybody to know they can sell it to us. But we don't do - We really don't want to encourage people No, it's not that easy. Like, nobody encourages people: Oh, you have a Rolex, I mean, this is the same thing. It's not that easy and probably you will So that's why we don't really sell [J] And then the other problem it would take one of our mechanics to go and find it because they are So that's away from them repairing [J] Yeah. [D] So this is a Leica [J] Yeah. [D] So you would buy this from somebody [J] A broken one for 500. [D] Okay. So five, $500. And so after you have it for $500. Yeah. You have to put the labor into fixing it. [J] Yeah. [D] And then you would sell it for double [J] Well a fully fixed one would go Now. Maybe. So there is. But in Leicas there is... [D] I saw the room up there. You have like 20 something people [J] Right. 25 full time. Yeah. [D] So you have enough profit margin. [J] Yeah. [D] From doing this to support [J] Yeah. That's a lot. I mean [J] Well, we don't make a profit. Or the profit is here. This room is the profit [D] Really? [J] Yes, Yes. So. So. And it hasn't And it won't turn it out into cash quite some time. But then again, for some random But for us, this is the future. And with this amount of material, Yeah. And basically this is a mine. And the guys, the miners are being trained or so, they will get their pay [D] Wow. So can we can we meet some of the people [J] We can try. [D] We can try?! Because they're pretty [J] They're pretty quiet. [D] And number one, people in Finland, look, that's that's aggressive, right? [J] Yes, kind of. [D] I'm a bit much So is that true? [J] Yes. And me and Jussi are not very Finnish Yeah. Yeah. [D] It's it's fun. It's fun. And also I feel awkward because every time I make eye contact and smile, Okay. So what you're about to see is interesting I'm a loud American. Right? I'm a loud American. And the Finnish And so I just walk up to Jukka, and I just start talking like And I am basically Is that right? Well, not offensive, but. But you did amazingly well. There's guys who've tried for years or, you know, And they've not succeeded. And I got invited to the table. But we connected over mechanics, So this is an American And this is us building a bridge together. It's a great moment, Yeah. It's okay. Yes. Thank you. So you're the master. [J] I think.. [D] What kind of camera is that? [J] A Leica 1 g Yeah, [D] I know that one. That's, it's amazing. [Distant voice] It is correct. Oh, is Leica your specialty? And are are What? Are you Toni? [Not Tony replying] No, no, no. [J] It's very correct. [D] So it's good. [J] It's amazing. Little bit off. But in tolerances. [D] So you have all the numbers memorized. [J] This is shutter curtain times. This is shutter time. [D] Yeah. [J] Yes. Fast [Lots of clicking and whirring noises] [Jukka, very quiet with each reply] [Clicking and whirring] Is good. [D] It's amazing. Yes, it's down to the two millisecond, It's a mechanical system. [J] Mechanical. It's very old camera. Yeah. I don't know. Germany. Technician. Good. [D] Yeah. The German technicians are good. So. So this is, this is fascinating. A mechanical device that goes down Can you do that 130, 35. [J] Tolerances. [D] Yeah. Can you do the same [J] Yes. Is correct time. [D] 20 (pointing at 33.33) Okay. 35 keep very fine. That is very repeatable. 35 point 8 milliseconds. Wow. [J] Mechanical! [D] It's amazing. [J] 70 years old of camera. [D] That's amazing. Yes. That's. [J] Leica is good. So so the gearing, how does it how does it make the time how does it. [J] Mechanical. [D] Is there gears? [J] There is the... How can I say in English... Gear box or something. [D] Gearbox. That's very, very good design. [J] There is brake - mechanical brake. [D] Yeah. Yeah. So it has a brake that stops Brake. [D] Do you know how to fix it? [J] Yes, of course. I push the button, then brake braking little bit and go... [D] Yeah. [J] One braking Mm. Mechanical. [D] It's amazing. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [Compressed air nozzle sounds] That was the best fake cleaning So he had already finished the camera All right. It's great to. [J] You've got invited to see the.. That that was a big... the rest of the camera on the table. [D] Oh, the Leica. [J] Yeah. Yeah. [D] Is that okay? [J] Yeah. [D] So he's. He's okay. Was this the master? [J] Yeah. [D] What's his name? [J] Jukka. [D] Juuks nice. Oh, So, is it okay, if I watch you Jukka? [J] Yes. This whole mechanism. [D] The whole thing is mechanical. [J] This, is all and this is only the cover, [D] Yeah, it is. Yes, but this is the uh this right here is the mechanism right [J] That's the shutter mechanism. [D] I'm a, I'm a mechanical engineer. That's what I do. This is far smarter than I am, though. Can I see how it [J] This one. [D] Oh, yeah. Can I. Can you hold it there? And I want to look here. Okay. Ready? Oh, yeah. Perfect. [J] Yeah. [D] See my camera here? [J] Okay. Yeah. Oh! [D] Oh, no. It didn't show. [J] This, So. Yeah. [D] Oh, you can see the gear rolling, a certain number of times [J] Let me one more [D] ready. How do you say ready in Finnish? [J] Valmis? [D] Valmis. [J] Valmis. [D] Yeah. So, yeah, forgive me. Is this the shutter speed? What is this? [J] This long, shutter speed. [D] How long the shutter speed is? Yeah. [J] Yeah, one second is longer. And this is half. [D] Wow. So, so eight. That should be 125 milliseconds. How do you say that in Finnish? [J] Sadaskahdeskymmenesviideosasekuntti ? [D] Is it hard to say in Finnish? [Destin and others laughing] Valmis. [J] Valmis [D] Valmis . Yeah. [J] Okay. Laukaisu. [D] okay. And so that's 125. And so if I rotate this to this one [D] Valmis. Yeah, that's good. [J] And uh faster speeds only here. [D] Okay, this is the shutter speed here. [J] Yes. this 1/1000. [D] Oh 1 milliseconds. [J] So 50. [D] So that's 4 milliseconds. All mechanical. That's amazing. [J] Yes [D] it's incredible [J] And very simple. [J] How - How old is that? [J] That's from the 19-. 50s. Five something. Yeah. So that's 70 years old. [D] Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So. So this is Jukka So that's your thing. And you've been doing it for a long time, [J] Yeah. [D] And Jukka just showed.. [J] I've got this This is from Mamiya 1989. [D] So this is your certification. [J] I was born - I was six months old at the time. So. [D] So it's cute that that Juho has a company having to do with cameras but Jukka [J] Yeah. [All laughing] [D] So this is Ari and Jukka is teaching Ari Yeah. What is this? Yeah. What is this? [A] So this is the modernized version of the classic camera testing machines, which are mostly from like seventies throughout the nineties era machines. [D] So so you have to have feedback. You have to have something [A] Yeah. [D] So what do you have? You have a. [A] Yeah, there's this kind of light [D] Did you, did you make this? [A] Yeah. Yeah, it's connected. [D] Jukka - come here. I'm going to ask Jukka a question. Jukka do you like do you like it running in a computer like this, [J] Maybe old is better. [D] Yeah, because it's simple. [J] Maybe the same. But yeah, You don't know how this work. [A] Yeah, just prototype. [D] Prototype? Yeah. [A] It'll be more like And then the testing I don't know if you guys already Yeah, that kind of stuff that you attach. There isn't any visible numbers [D] This is still software. [A] Yeah. We need the software So then we can get the values going on. [D] So you're changing the light value. [A] Yeah. From this. [D] Yeah. [A] Terminal software and Yeah. Now we can... [D] I'm with Jukka, That's good. It looks really nice a screen here with the numbers so [A] But probably the laptop will be I have been keeping my notes here [Both laughing] But at the final stage there will be some kind of tablet or laptop or I don't know what is that the monitor, that is being on top of this part, this is kind of one box and then you need some kind of laptop or something. [D] Yeah [A] So you can use that software. [D] This is original? [A] And here is the. [D] Yeah, you can tell And this is the new one. [A] Yeah. It fits there [D] So you guys are trying to use modern technology [A] Old ones - there isn't any spare parts so we need to replace them. [D] So you have to build a catalog of 3D [A] Yeah, that's probably in the future and more efficient So then we can print the part [D] So you just pull up a camera and you can [A] Yeah, that's it mostly. Somebody has to scan it [D] That's awesome. Well, thank you very much for showing me I appreciate that. Why are you building a new tester? [J] Well, it might be a game changer in how... Because most of the shops even if they would want to, because So the game changer aspect of what the old machines do, So instead of our guys going and saying, I went through all the shutter speeds we can go, BEEP [D] here's your print out. [J] And here's your shutter speeds or a certificate or what so not.. [D] So the real, the real reason is You get the old machine right here Everybody else can have the new one. They can line up, Is that the pro? That's what we're doing. And I'm going to turn your volume back up. Okay? [J] Okay, So it's okay. [D] Okay. Thank you very much. Nice to meet you. Yeah, I appreciate that. That was fun. [J] Yeah. [D] Yeah. Just the idea of I want to go all the way down a shutter is mechanically controlled [J] Yes. [D] Every time. Or two, four milliseconds. Exactly. But we can't do that. Yeah. And, and then there's different There is shutters that can go up and down. There is shutters that are central There's shutters And all and they could do that in the fifties which is, you know, 70 years ago on how to make it and how to you need to do to make it exact And they managed to do it then. And that's that's [D] Do you - can we run the old machine? [J] Yes. Uh huh. 1983 made machine. This is even a Finland made machine. [D] Really? [J] Uh, how they did it? Yeah, in late, uh . . . in the 1930s. [D] No way. [J] Yes. This, I don't know if it actually runs but it has a spinning thing with a light coming through and then you shoot it and then it shows kind of different sights because. [D] The wave? You see the wave form? [J] Yeah, you see the wave form becasue it has slits and it goes at a certain speed and with this one was what they used to calibrate Leicas before [D] So they would just count the number. [J] Yeah, or it kind of like it kind of has a certain form at 125th, 250th of a second and a certain different performance 1/500th of a second [D] How do you solve a super fast timing problem if you don't have solid [J] Yeah, [D] That's awesome. This is great. Hey, man, that's cool. I'm happy. Is there anything else I think that's it. I mean, we have a YouTube studio, [D] Yeah. Then can I see this old film back here? We'll look at the film. [J] Yeah. [D] Yeah. What is the story here? [J] This is the end of the line So when items have been checked, photographed, all is good with them they are on the website, this is where they end up, In this warehouse. They actually sell Yeah. We have also film limited quantities of film because of production not being able to keep up with demand But we have film, we have everything Our speciality is that, Uh huh. That are really, really odd. Ah, we list everything So then there is a stock for a Leica This is a shoulder stock, for example. [J] Yeah. [D] That's a remote trigger. [J] Yeah. And so you would have a 400. Or a 600 or 800mm. And to keep it steady, you would (hold it like this). I mean, obviously it's Leica, but, many places [D] So you're building the brains that will take this information forward? [J] Yeah. Yeah. All of this also has now a catalog item, we get a Icoblitz 3 or 5. Which is some kind of flash then we will have to do less work We have some idea of what it's worth So the broader it goes, the less knowhow items needs to have to know tells more. You want a sticker? [D] Yes, I want a sticker. [J] They are out here. Here you can have your XPAN. [D] Well, I've never touched an XPAN. [J] We can see if there's one [D] What do you have? So there's a Xpan and what is this? [J] A Mamiya seven. [D] I've never touched a XPAN or a Mamiya. [J] Mamiya RB67. [D] I have touched one of those. [J] Canon F1 and there is, uh, there was a Nikon F2 also. There we go, Nikon F2 [D] Nice. [J] Let's go and see if there is the XPAN still. [D] Yeah. Thank you. Is this the is this the licorice?
