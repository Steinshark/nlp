The problem with OneDrive backup. Leo Notenboom here for Askleo.com. Today I want to walk you through the OneDrive Backup feature what it's been doing to the files on your The issue is that it is extremely, in my opinion, turn it on, even worse So I want to walk through exactly One is just OneDrive by itself before what your system looks like, Then we're going to turn OneDrive backup on and you can see exactly how it Then we'll turn OneDrive backup off and you'll see why it is Here we are in a freshly Eleven Pro. I've not made any changes Edge is the default browser. All of the privacy settings are You get the idea. So what I want to do is walk through exactly where things like Let's start with Windows File Explorer. Now you can see here that in each case desktop downloads, documents and so That's going to be important I'm going to move this window to be able to look at a couple Now, if we take a look at your Documents shortcut here on the left hand side, And if we take a look at Location, in the user Ask Leo, which Ask Leo It's going to be replaced by the So if I were to actually go to that folder in another window, which I'm going to do of File Explorer, if I now go to C, And here if we take a look at Documents, I'm going to put this in the lower So if I look at this folder, Documents, and this actual physical folder How do I know that? Well, I'm going to create I'll just create a text document. But you can see the file has That's because we're using two different ways to look at the same This shortcut called Documents is really just a shortcut to this specific Great. Now let's have a look at OneDrive because OneDrive is installed and running in with a Microsoft account, which, is so highly encouraged So there are two places One, of course, up here You can see that it's And if I open that up, you can see If I click on that, you can see though, That is a different Documents folder In fact, if we take a look at its and you can see right there that its C: users. Username OneDrive. So if I now go to that folder, c users username OneDrive. That's where this document folder is. If I double click on it to go into it now I'm looking at it again One is the full path to the Documents And the other is using this But they are the same location. And once again, in Each, I will create a new a document originally Now you can see I just created that. The other thing about OneDrive, of course, is that it's more than The only thing we've been playing with By creating files on this computer, all we've really done is placed Again on this computer. The cloud hasn't really been part Even though we've created a file in a folder that happens to be Let's go look at OneDrive. I've opened up OneDrive and I've placed Now you can see that even though we were we just created a file on the hard Because it was in the OneDrive folder, it was automatically uploaded storage@onedrive.com. So if we take We have Documents, which is a mirror of the Documents Why do I call it a mirror? Well, that's kind of like what That's its fundamental job in the world, is to mirror what you place in your Another example might be Here there's a second text I will hit enter. Now you can see this icon changed very briefly from a pair of arrows That means that OneDrive has If I go over here to the OneDrive The file is there now, too. So I've got my document originally in And if I now delete that file in the cloud, it will disappear Remember OneDrive is a mirror. Whatever you do on your hard disk in the OneDrive folder And whatever you do in OneDrive gets reflected in your Now, I keep referring to the OneDrive If we go back to the old Documents folder, the one we started with before we started It's all still there. That's about to change. So far, all we've really done is worked We have not enabled the backup function. That's what we're going to do next. Over here, I'm going to right click on the OneDrive icon in the Notification I'm going to click on the Backup tab In our case, OneDrive is allowing I have seen it be so insistent that in fact, or it's just on by default, depending So you may already have backup turned on. Some of the things that we saw looked a little different to you, I'm going to go ahead Now, you'll notice a few things changed in Let's take a look at exactly what changed. I'm going to go ahead and close the OneDrive Settings dialog because You'll notice that the local Disk users Ask Leo Documents, the original Documents that we had put some things in before we That's because our Documents, have been moved into the Documents And the Documents shortcut updated to refer not to the original it's now a shortcut to the Documents I need to say that one again. Before you turn on OneDrive backup, the shortcut in Windows File Explorer points to Users, your username Documents. After you turn on OneDrive backup, that shortcut is updated to point Your documents have been moved into the OneDrive Documents folder, we're looking at the contents It now contains both the file originally and the file that was originally The two Documents folders have been merged The original Documents folder still exists, and it is empty because And we can confirm that all of this got mirrored online by hitting Refresh And sure enough, That's what OneDrive is By moving your documents into the OneDrive then your documents will be automatically In other words, they'll be backed up. Now, I've been focusing purely on the Documents folder, the other folders that were listed But this is so confusing when it comes to Documents that it really So great, this might be Your Documents shortcut now refers You can do all your work in that Documents folder and it will automatically If that's what you want, great. You're done. The only possible remaining confusion is that this other Documents folder That can be confusing. But if you understand that there are two Documents folders and by turning the quote unquote real one, The other problem, and this one is very If you have 5GB of data in your Documents folder, for Maybe you've been doing work there for a long time, maybe you have It's just accumulated to the point When you turn on OneDrive backup, One, all of those documents, folder will be moved and then they'll be uploaded Now, depending on your Internet speed, of course that could take 5GB is 5GB. But here's the catch. A Microsoft account is free, but the free account comes So what that means is the moment you turned on backup, Documents folder, you've instantly Now, Microsoft will of course There are a couple of ways you could just buy more OneDrive space My recommendation, if you want to go that route, It comes with a terabyte of space, and that was another way But what if you don't want to do that? Well, you might think turning off It is kind of. Let's do it. So we're currently in a situation where because we are now working So you can see here we've got Users Username Documents, And then up here I've got which is the Documents folder that we have Let's turn Backup off once again over to the OneDrive icon Right click on it. Settings backup. Manage Backup. Now we're going to turn it off. Stop backup, stop back up on Documents, and stop back up on Pictures. Great. One would think that we would be done. Now I can go ahead and close this, and we But our files didn't move. In fact, the Documents shortcut over here was updated to your computer's But now there's this other shortcut In other words, the thing that was taking up all that space in OneDrive All of the documents that had been backed into the OneDrive Documents folder, have not been placed back in your In order to do that, Which, to be fair, is fairly easy. if I want this file originally to the Computer Documents folder, Boom, it's there. Deleted files are removed everywhere. That's because we deleted And yes, we know that's When you remove something from your OneDrive folder, it's being deleted Go ahead and hit Got it on this One. Because if I refresh the cloud, you'll It is again a mirror of what's We've moved a document out the OneDrive Documents folder, and placed Are you confused yet? I know I am. The short version of all of this is simply this without OneDrive backup I call it your native It is at C. Your username documents. It's on your PC, and it's only on your PC. OneDrive will have its own Documents but it is unrelated to your The OneDrive Documents folder is See? It's a completely different location. It's a completely different folder from You can use the two however you want. If you want Documents to be uploaded to OneDrive automatically, do your If you want to keep your Documents only local, then do the work It's your choice. It's actually very easy to manage. If you turn on OneDrive backup, then OneDrive will try One Documents folder by merging into the OneDrive Documents folder, which If you turn backups off, Your files remain in the They are not placed back If you want to move things back to your native Documents folder, you can do And drop. A lot of people are very confused by how There are other ways to do it. Honestly, dropbox does a much better But OneDrive is what we have. It's what's on the machine. And like I said, Microsoft pushes so hard and to have backups turned on, in this confusing situation without Hopefully now you have an understanding. My recommendation is that once you understand where Turn off OneDrive backups. Manage your documents yourself. Like I said, if you want something in the If you want something local, only put Manage it yourself. Yes, that does mean you need to take responsibility for backing up your But if you're backing up your PC, techniques, say image Backups nightly, The cloud backup is just another layer. That's my recommendation. The OneDrive Backup feature is too confusing and too invasive I hope that helps clarify There is a written article on this topic that will try to clarify Some of it may be easier to follow written on the page, so to do that, I'm Leo Notenboom, and this
