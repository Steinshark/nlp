[mellow guitar] [man] My grandfather on my mom's side You were put in a lottery to draw lots. So these were all kind of like It's an interesting experiment. 'Cause this is what it's like, Yeah? Acknowledged in '59. -Yeah. ...all of the different races were... For the sugar plantation You had a Filipino camp, but then post-admission into statehood, the new subdivisions, So then you had the homes here and the subdivision was the next house a Portuguese family, next house, Filipino family. We were like the first five homes of a hundred-plus homes. So it was all sand. [Peter] What are the prices now -Oh, God! -Today? Today is like, what? They say a three bedroom house -So like this is 1.3 mil? -At least. [Peter] You're what you consider Native, -I guess local. One melted pot. [laughs] -So is that how it works here? Most people -Yeah, everybody's kind of, you know... There was a period where everybody of culture, and race, and ethnicity. But for me, I look back and said well, We're all live here in a bowl of salad. We're all tossed salad, all mixed in, but I wouldn't say we're melted. Because we still all hold -Okay. -A tomato is still a tomato, a cucumber is still a cucumber. You know, and so my grandparents were They were like the first generation and they came from the Philippines. And then they married my grandmother I look back at it, it was kind of The quality of the people for digging tunnels... -Okay. -And so you found a lot of them Whether it be Chinese, And then you had some Plumbers and power people, you know? So these are the buildings here. The sugar transport buildings. -Are they still in operation? These are all obsolete, out of operation. -So no more sugar on the island? -No more sugar on the island. This is the sugar platform. -What's it now? -It's just right now, I guess -How does it make you feel to see this? -Um, for me? -Yeah. -I want to get it back for the kingdom. -You know, this is kingdom land. This was, at one time, the king's. 'Cause they control the port. -Okay, so when did they pretty much take control -...or was it a power sharing sort of-- The military backed They illegally overthrew And this is 131 years ago. I think it was 1892, '93. But this is the harbor. This is the entrance of the harbor. -This is your lifeline these days? -Everything comes through here? -How important is that? -Very important. -I would say well over 95% comes through this port. And I say 95 because a small percentage but the greater majority -How much of your food -Well, there is evidence or rumor of all the food that's consumed For me, as a farmer, as a grower of food, I'd like to challenge us to say, &quot;How do we zero-net import?&quot;. Why are we going to the store and buying a banana -Mm-hmm. -When we can ask ourselves, [Alika] We just need to start with [Peter] So you do have a lot of land here, -This is all sugar lands. This is all controlled close to 45,000 acres over to a Canadian retirement investment fund and they bought this land. Some little more than six years ago and it's primarily lemons and limes. There's some coffee here. Today a lot of politicians, they make their decisions On the pluses and the minuses. If you are raised on the values of Kanaka, -Yeah. -Then you are embedded with Of state motto of [Hawaiian]. &quot;The life of the land shall be remained as long as we continue -Okay. -Right and just way. In that, you know for me, any decision, any new decision, this decision that I'm about to make, This decision, does it affect our air? What's its effect and affect Effect and affect onto the elders? How does it affect the birds? How does it affect the nature? How does it affect the ocean and the fish? Everything like that. You must look at it and say, &quot;Does anything or anyone And that's the difference of [Hawaiian]. Yeah? [Alika] It's too many people move here They just sleep here. Because if you live here you would then Many of them all have some place else If anything happens here, If something happens here, This is our home. So our position always is Aloha Aina. &quot;Protect it with the love of the land.&quot; Malama Aina, And so then they come here and get exactly like the place they ran away from. This is the way it is because this is that we want it to be. -The lifestyle here is... You've seen a lot, you've traveled. It's just slower in general? -Or what would you say the lifestyle is? But it's getting faster day by day. Technology has made us go faster. -You know? -But where I live, my wife and son, I no longer do that so I always tell them, [laughs] I'll run the grill. So they go out, they go diving, they go For them it's their therapy Our backyard, we grow food. We harvest coconuts and my son's and so we harvest the coconut and now and we have 100% organic coconut candy. -You know? [mellow guitar] [Peter] So this is a friend of yours -Actually she was a young student of mine I was a canoe coach. -[Peter] Smells so good up here. -These are all eucalyptus and pine. -[Alika] She see me? -Okay. [Peter] Oh, what a place. [Peter] Almost chilly out. [Alika] Yeah. [Alika] We got a farm up here. [Peter] Seventy years old, Alika, huh? -Yeah. -Wow. Just island life [Alika chuckling] Yes. [woman] How's this view? [Peter] What a view. [Kai] The 500 acres of solar -[Alika] Yeah. I shut her down. -[Peter] You shut down the solar? -So they're gonna put in solar panels? You can see it, They're gonna do an additional 250 acres. -Why'd you shut it down? -It so goes against green energy. It's like the amount of greenhouse gasses to make one panel You never see one acre that the battery's And the fact that there's no disposal it's like what the hell? It kills all the microbes in the soil. It's like we're not gonna be able We'll have to replenish the soil. [Peter] Let me ask you this. You can't see from here How do locals feel about the windmills? I guess it depends who you talk to. -That magnetic solar storm came and it was cranking at 200 miles an hour. That means the battery cells were full So where does the excess energy go It directs itself to the ground. [Peter] You are in contrary to what who think windmills, solar panels -You're saying no, it's not helping. There's no place for it to be disposed of. That's one of the gnarliest things. -You like natural gas? -I think nuclear is more clean energy Let the water flow Yeah, that can combust as well but we would have all the water Which will be replenishing -Okay. So you're saying that almost all of and technically still owned Is that correct? -The actual crown. -Pre-annexation? Not the Hawaiian nation. -The only and real crown. King Kamehameha the Great, Pai`ea, Which is the entire island of Lanai as his royal historical domain. Meaning that all Lanai, is under a Pioneer Mill contract Pioneer Mill merged a company Harry, Jeanette, and Weinberg's thing for speaking Hawaiian or dancing hula or black magic dancing. They stripped our language When my grandfather won in 1996, -Won what? -100% crown judgment. It's over 4.1 million acres. -Your grandfather? -228 islands of Hawaii, yeah. -So there were no deeds back then -I have all the paperwork. I had seven boxes I have like a bunch of other stuff left -[Kai] Maybe not record this. -This is my Family Pioneer Mill, MFACT, What are the guys that came and did Yakuza. [laughs] [Peter] Yakuza was here? -Seriously? -Well now-- -A lot of it. Industrialized in hotels, condos, and all of the big, big houses [laughs] So what it's saying is after 80 years that the Paki family owns owned by the late Frank Clark Moamokakui lands is like the largest land It goes to 228 islands. We only know about eight I don't even know about -Nobody lives -A lot of them have and a lot of our old culture Like in our culture in my paperwork Which is Eke Crater. You know, Eke Crater -In the clouds there? -Yeah, in our paperwork that doesn't even exist nowadays. These people have commercialized -These people? Who are they? -Even just the Hawaiians. The Hawaiians that are down there, [Kai and Alika laugh] In our culture, like the Kapunas that you're like, [speaks Hawaiian angrily] -Kapunas, what are Kapunas? -[Kai] Kapunas are the elders. -The language you don't speak [Alika] So that says -Lele four. [Peter] What's Lele four? -[Alika] The land in vision. Where Murdoc, Bill Gates, and the richest running my lease hold, Larry Ellison. [Peter] Larry Ellison owns most of Lanai? Or I'm gonna air quote &quot;owns&quot;. -Lele four. [laughs] -[Alika] Steward-- [Alika] Look. This is Lele one, two, three, and four. [laughs] This is Maui Nui. The West Side Maui and Lanai is Lele four. [Peter] And Lele four is yours? -All of that. She had one piece-- [Peter] What were you saying [Alika and Kai laugh] [Peter] You were saying something. -Oprah Winfrey bought Thompson Ranch. Thompson Ranch was on a lease hold That's my great-great-grandma. Two of our big parcels of land And she was aware. She's aware of the not owning the land under not a fee simple title But she conducted her own energy all the way from Haleakala Ranch who use it all the way to Wailea. -Okay, so how does that work? Someone, when they buy land like that, -You can get land from a state or You own the establishment that's on it. -You don't own the land? The crown land can never be sold. -You're saying Oprah -No neither does Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos. -But they think they do? -They bought the same parcel. They think they do. -They have a title with their name on it? So in courts it's their land, right? -They're not happy but nobody's I could challenge them and end this lease. But this lease, I would have to end the whole thing. That's why I've been Like Haleakala Ranch Baldwins -So if I bought a home -Yeah... -Would that be legit? -I think you would have to You know, 'cause some of the lands, they were giving like 100 year lease and her particular land, the lease was upped in 1988. The grandpa, and he went through adjudication and the adjudication was settled in '96. -And we only got a portion [Alika] Right. And so they said pretty much like, &quot;Here, for now just...&quot; [Kai] But now your title insurance -So if I-- -Title insurance is saying and if the land owner was to ever come, you put onto the land but you have you have to leave. -So you don't get a proper title, -No. -You get basically -The crown will always own the land, -People would disagree -People are just finding out. [Kai] Unfortunately, that's been losing has been losing it And I didn't know. My family was kind of Who gets what? Who's at the top? How much can we get? They really messed sh*t up. My dad, my uncles, They were all just doing drugs, and then here I come along in hitchhiking on the side of the road. Mahi Pono, this Canadian company, that's supposed to be and they're growing lemons, potatoes-- [Alika] What about the sugar mill? -The sugar mill The sugar mill is still inconsidered They sold that. [Alika] I want that sugar mill back. -[Kai] The China guy is-- I want the water -There's a well there. [Kai] Guess where one of the wells is. -Under the church right there. [Peter] So why do you want the water? [Kai] To grow food. We have none. -To grow food If that property has and if I want to put into affordable homes-- [Kai] Actual affordable homes. -Yeah, we need to show that we have water. And then on top of that we want to grow our own homes. We want to be able to grow our own hemp, build our own building materials, So we can stand up our own homes without shipping in So these are real problems Our people are being a choice. Oh, we gotta choose to live here or leave and many of them are choosing to leave. -More are outside of the islands -Yeah, yeah. -There's more Hawaiians than there is within the state. And so the question is if there's no Hawaiians, [mellow guitar] There's a federal act -Okay. And it was primarily just to get On this island of that kind of land the most unlivable, It was all lava rock, forest. -Are we on this land right now? -This is it? -This is one of the subdivisions. It's called Waiahuli Hawaiian Homelands. -It's nice land though. -Yeah, took many, many years for them Getting the people on the land. -Okay, so Native Hawaiians and it's just passed down -Yes, so it's a 99 year lease. To first qualify of 50% blood quantum of Hawaiian blood. And then now you can pass it down to a successor of 25% or more. As we go forward there's gonna be -...and more inter-marrying. -The current legislation down to 3% blood quantum. So that five generations from now -Right, because how many Native -I really don't know but-- -Yeah, not that much. -And so when it gets that low you can't -Right. And it's been years, I mean only now there's like a wait list of like 50% or more Hawaiians -Okay. [Peter] But there are a lot of Are the Hawaiians funding those -It's coming... -Okay, so the land is free for them -The land is a dollar a year for 99 years. -And they were to build their homes. The act did not say put Hawaiians into $600,000 mortgages. The act said just to put So that they could have and practice their own self-determination. [Peter] So when you live on Maui correct me where I'm wrong here, it's like Hawaii is the the United States -Would that be a good way of saying it? -Here is totally different -Right. -And you guys are very proud, right? -Every island has its own beauty. Every island has its own quirks. [Alika] '50s and early '60s, We only had like a police force Because no military base, no high-security prison kind of controlled -Okay. -And then in the '70s when tourism came, and then the economic income increased, and the taxation increased, we were then able to have a But in the early stages -Oh, interesting. -[Peter] Surfing is huge in the culture? [Peter] Oh, this is great. [Alika] Young surfers. [Alika speaking Hawaiian] [Hawaiian] [rooster crows] [Alika chuckling] Check out the waves. [waves crashing] [Alika] My grandmother, And opihi is a limpet and seaweed, limu, we call it limu. All of that was all edible but she would walk through here gathering food [Peter] To the village? -Yeah, this is But she was very spiritual A lot of it was and always very, very communicative [Alika] I call it the Kanaka lens. Kanaka is from a perspective of a Hawaiian eye. You incorporate not what is but you also incorporate It's a wholesome approach and not You also must react through your na'al. Na'al is your gut. -Okay. -Or your gut instinct. -And we look at that as your ancestors through a manifestation of nature. And they try to find ways So many a times you have a feeling inside. It's kind of like a butterfly -Okay. -That is your ancestors of giving you this gift of guidance. Some people will call it gut instinct. -Right. -The failure of man we only listen to it 20% of the time. We only follow our gut 20% of the time. And I've always shared with the kids, that's your Kupuna, that's your elders, to guide you, to steer you And if you ever have a doubt, Make the decision 80% of the time. -[Peter exhales thoughtfully] -But to listen to your gut -In tune. -Yeah. So how to reset yourself. -That's interesting. So that's the ancestors coming in -Yeah. -So always follow your gut? -Yeah, so another thing would be hoailona. Your ancestors come to you, through manifestations of nature. That they give you signs that is out of the ordinary. Sometimes it comes to you in the sun. It'll shine bright. Sign... You'll see the change in light. Sometimes it'll come to you Sometimes it'll come to you in the back of your ear, You have to recognize it That's you, tutu. And you're listening, and feeling, They come to you in rain, or heavy rain. They can come to you in a rainbow. Out of the blue you'll see a rainbow. They come to you in animals. In the ocean Out of the blue What does that mean? So it's one thing to see The second thing, or the challenge, You know, -Yeah? Say I see an owl and it's flying with me right here. It's telling me whatever I'm thinking it's going with me. So I would interpret that If that owl flew in front of me across, that is telling me exercise with caution. I've seen a couple of times and pass me going backwards. And I was headed into a meeting. I quickly interpreted that as Don't even go. Yeah? And I just... I was with a group of guys &quot;Uncle, you saw that bird?&quot; &quot;What direction was it flying? I goes, He goes, &quot;I think they're telling us no.&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah, so let's and we turned around and walked out. Yeah? And so these are things, real things -Mm-hmm. -Because we are not here by ourselves. We are constantly being sheep-herded and supported by those who came before us. -Hmm. -They all stand behind us You didn't get to Maui You know, there is a purpose -Yeah? -And so those ancestors work in together, and they communicate, and the realm of communicating to us and manifestations of nature. [Alika] I wanted you to see [Peter chuckling] Okay. That's a solid change of topics, [Peter] &quot;US Postal Office&quot;, -Yeah, still going. Yeah, it's the last sugar mill. -So it was the big five, right? -On all of the islands? -No sugar here. -Yeah, this is the last operating They shut it down some six years ago. -Six, that's it? -There's not one in Kawaihae right now? I think the entity was Rumor has it that they have no interest -And the water? They want to tear everything down [Peter] Here we got the tape [both laughing] [Peter] Here we go. [Peter] This might be the most beat up -It's got the old boxes. [Peter] It's got the old boxes. This is it, huh? [Alika] Yeah, it pushes out -It's active as in -Yeah. [Peter] That's great. -Still active. [Peter] You know what, haven't been updated since the '50s. I gotta say -Yeah? -I always ship things overnight [Peter] Here we go, here's the box. Feels like something -No, we're good. [Peter] So the tracks you can see here -Right, on the left side coming here, you'll see a couple of buildings. They're old, old plantation buildings. That was the manager's building. Today it's a sugar museum. So this is like a former manager's house. So they kept it refurbished, operating. These two buildings are all part of [Peter] So sugar really is -Yeah. -What's up here? -The land that she was telling me about, This golf course is part of the land -Kai, the woman we met earlier. And so I said take it back I'm going this golf course can be a farm. It already has irrigation water lines We can easily transform it Every golf course, instant. We can grow-- -You don't have a lot of -No. [laughter] -Fair to say? -You're definitely not making them now. -It's beautiful up here. [Alika] So this whole section -Why? -Yeah, but shut down? It's not operating? -Not operating. -They're mowing the grass. Technically she can claim it and the Japanese that they just left it like that. -This side-- -Yeah, yeah, and the Japanese -This side is an operating golf course. -Yeah. [Alika] On every island that are struggling to turn a profit. So why not just take it back -Where are all the golfers right now? -Yeah, this is a private club. -These guys pay 15 grand a month -Right. This is called the Marilyn Monroe House. -Oh, that's cool. -I forget the guy's name that designed it. -But this is what similar design... -That is cool. [Alika] &quot;King Kamhameha Golf Club&quot;. [Peter] What a beautiful building. [Peter] Wow. [Alika] Last week I went to a high school. I spoke to two classes, about 30 in each. So about 60 students. Of the 60 students I asked who is -Not one raised their hands. -They don't want to work for tourism. Of the 60 students I said well, &quot;You guys all eat?&quot; They said, &quot;Yeah.&quot; I said, &quot;How many meals a day?&quot; &quot;One meal, two meals, three meals?&quot; Every one of them, three meals. I said, &quot;So you guys eat 21 meals a week.&quot; &quot;Who's gonna grow the food?&quot; Only three hands went up -Yeah, a lot of people don't want to do -So then I said, &quot;Okay, you're not then what's your plan?&quot; &quot;What you 57 others?&quot; -They all shrugged their shoulders. -Have no plan. -Wow. -Is there a lack of motivation? -Lack of vision and lack of reality. And I said, and in one year you're gonna be kicked out You know? [Alika] But what we're looking at is that once was all sugar production. -This whole valley? My thinking is this, 45,000 acres that was bought up sold it to a Canadian retiree investment fund. An investment fund This enterprise is losing money The parent company The company up there They bought up and just recently filed bankruptcy. So I'm hoping for And that the investors &quot;We don't wanna be losing more money.&quot; But I need us to be ready financially to get supporters so that we can -Do you have an email contact, How do people find you? My full name A-L-I-K-A-A-T-A-Y@Gmail. -You ready for your email to blow up? -I'm open. -If it's to-- -Like I told you, I'm not limping in. You know, -You know? Well I'm sure you're gonna get and like when I'm finding stories -Yeah. -...was putting a lot of feelers out, You are showing us a perspective and a look of Maui -Yeah. -So really appreciate you Showing us your friend, her story. That was very interesting. -Yeah. -And respect to what you're doing, -It's the journey. It's the journey And it's also to dream, We can't have reality without dreams. -Well your passion for your homeland, It's very obvious, so... -No, thank you for your time. -All right guys, It's the start of a multi-part Moloka'i, Oahu, Kauai. This is just the beginning -We have a whole lot more. -Lot more coming. -Yeah. -All right, thanks for coming along. -Until the next one... Aloha. [mellow guitar]
