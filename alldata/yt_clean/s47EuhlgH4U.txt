PICK ONE WORD TO I DO NOT HESITATE. CONSCIOUSNESS! THE INNER SENSE OF SOUNDS, THOUGHTS, FEELINGS. THE INTIMATE PRESENCE OF YOURSELF BEING YOURSELF. THAT'S THE &quot;HARD PROBLEM&quot; INTERNAL SENTIENCE - OUR INNER OF HUMAN EXPLORATION. I MARVEL AT ALL THE DIVERSE CAN BE EXAMINED. I KNOW CONSCIOUSNESS HERE'S WHAT I DO NOT I'M ROBERT LAWRENCE KUHN AND TO FIND OUT. HOW TO EXPLORE CONSCIOUSNESS? USUALLY, PHILOSOPHERS TALK TO TO BRAIN SCIENTISTS. LOTS OF INTERESTING CAN WE ENLARGE THE DISCOURSE? VIEW CONSCIOUSNESS - INCLUDING EXPERIENCE - THROUGH BREAK BOUNDARIES? EMANCIPATE OUR THINKING? HOW TO START CLEAN WITH MINIMUM DEFINE CONSCIOUSNESS - LAY I GO TO CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND, TO TOUGH-MINDED REALISM. FORMER EDITOR OF THE PRESTIGIOUS SIMON, I'VE BEEN OBSESSED WITH I DID A DOCTORATE HOW DO YOU WHAT'S YOUR UNIQUE PROBABLY, I WOULDN'T TRY I THINK THAT'S GOING TO I'M NOT SURPRISED NEUROPHYSIOLOGIST DIDN'T HELP. LEIBNIZ SAID THAT IF WE SIZE OF A MILL AND WE STILL WOULDN'T I MEAN, WE'RE CONSCIOUS OF WORLD WE DESCRIBE IN I THINK THAT THE HARD PROBLEM ACTUALLY WHAT FOR EXAMPLE DAVID PEOPLE THINK THE HARD PROBLEM PHYSICS MISSES OUT. THERE IS THE PURPLE SMELL OF CHEESE. THE SMELL OF CHEESE, THE SIGHT AND SCIENCE DOESN'T FIND THAT. SCIENCE CAN RUMMAGE AROUND IN FIND THE SMELL OF CHEESE OR AND THAT'S SUPPOSED TO NOW I THINK THE REALLY HARD OURSELVES THAT THERE IS NO AS IT WERE, AN ARTIFACT I THINK THE PHILOSOPHER WHO DID OF THAT WAS LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN, WORKED IN CAMBRIDGE. AND THE CENTRAL EXHIBIT IN HIS PRIVATE LANGUAGE ARGUMENT. YOU'VE GOT THIS EPISTEMOLOGICAL OTHER PEOPLE HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS BUT AT LEAST YOU THINK TRANSPARENT TO YOURSELF. YOU KNOW WHAT ITS LIKE FOR YOU. WITTGENSTEIN ASKED WHETHER THAT WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOUR OWN PAST? MAYBE YOU ARE CERTAIN YOU ARE SO CERTAIN YOU WERE AND YOU SAY WELL I CAN REMEMBER ASPECT OF YOUR WHY SHOULD WE SUPPOSE WHY SHOULD WE SUPPOSE THAT IF YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS IS AS IT ANYTHING ELSE, IT'S YOUR OWN REASON TO BE CERTAIN OF IT. WHY SHOULD YOU SUPPOSE THAT THIS CONCEPTION OF HOW THE FIVE MINUTES AGO? AND WITTGENSTEIN DRAWS CONSCIOUSNESS ISN'T THIS GASEOUS YOU'VE GOT PRIVILEGED ACCESS FOR EVERYONE ELSE. IT'S JUST AS AND ONCE YOU'VE SEEN THAT I SLIGHTLY MORE REALISTIC WAY OF THAT SOUNDS LIKE A I THINK BEHAVIOR BUT WE'VE GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL WE KNOW ABOUT OURSELVES YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE YOU CAN CONCEAL IT, MAYBE SUCCESSFULLY AND SO, OUR MENTAL DUE TO SOME EXTENT SUPPOSING FOR EXAMPLE YOU IMPORTANT SOCIALLY YOU WOULD BE DISPOSED TO IS PERHAPS AT SOMEBODY'S BUT YOU MAINTAIN SO YOUR BEHAVIOR DOESN'T YOUR FEELING THOUGH MIGHT BE - HERE A DISPOSITION WHICH YOU TO SNIGGER OR TO TAKE OR SOMETHING YOU SO WE CAN CERTAINLY CONCEAL DISPOSITION TO BEHAVE. IN THAT CASE A MORE BEHAVIORISM, SOMETIMES CALLED TO FREE US I THINK FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH IS ONLY PEOPLE, PROBLEMATICALLY ALL WE KNOW. I THINK THAT KIND OF GET RID OF. AS I SAY THE HARD PROBLEM IS I THOUGHT I HAD CONSCIOUSNESS - SIMON PROVIDES ANOTHER: MINDS ARE CONSCIOUS. WHAT'S MORE, HE SAYS, WE CAN'T AGO, WE OURSELVES MUST WE BECOME RESIGNED TO NOT KNOWING IS THIS REALITY? OR IS THIS 'PHILOSOPHY' I SHOULD LOOK BEYOND PHILOSOPHY. HOW TO GET AT THE I GO TO THE BRAIN AND I GO TO OXFORD, I VISIT THE WRITER, SUSAN GREENFIELD. SUSAN, WHAT IS IT ABOUT PHILOSOPHERS, I THINK THAT ANY ACADEMIC, WHETHER THEY'RE PHILOSOPHERS, YOUR TERMS, AND AS SOON AS YOU PROBLEM BECAUSE HOW DO WE DEFINE FLYING, FOR OR, YOU COULD HAVE REFERRAL TO COULD SAY A TABLE IS A PIECE OF NOW LET'S TRY STRATEGIES WITH CONSCIOUSNESS. CONSCIOUSNESS IS YOU CAN BE SITTING PERFECTLY NOT SAYING ANYTHING, YET SO THAT OPERATIONAL WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER STRATEGY? CONSCIOUS IS A WHAT? WHAT'S HIGHER THAN THAT? NOW SOMEONE COULD GET OUT OF IT BRAIN, BUT THAT'S WHAT ANESTHETIC EXPLANATION, WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS TO SAY WHAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS, IT IS NOT. SO WHAT WE HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS SO, CONSCIOUSNESS CAN BE DEFINED SLEEP, LET'S SAY, OR PERHAPS COULD SAY IT'S THE INNER ELSE CAN HACK INTO. SO, LET'S THEN GET THIS INNER SUBJECTIVITY. AND THAT INNER SUBJECTIVITY OF DIFFERENT CONTENT. SO, THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION ABSOLUTE SUM OF WHATEVER OR IS THERE SOMETHING ADDITIONAL UNAWARE OF TO MAKE YEAH, OKAY - - YOU CAN'T GET AWAY IT IS THE SUBJECTIVITY PROBLEM, BECAUSE I THINK SCIENCE IS ALL IT'S ALL ABOUT QUANTIFICATION. NOW TAKE CONSCIOUSNESS. WE'VE JUST SAID IT'S WHAT IS THERE TO QUANTIFY? SO LET'S JUST PUT IT BACK SQUARE POSIT THAT THERE'S SOME LITTLE HEAD, SOME FACT CONTROLLER AND QUESTION I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU &quot;RIGHT, GUESS WHAT? IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY, TODAY HOW THE BRAIN AND I NOW KNOW HOW IT HAPPENS.&quot; WHAT WOULD YOU WOULD YOU EXPECT TO SEE WOULD YOU EXPECT YOU UNTIL WE CAN EVEN ARTICULATE WE DELIVER IT? NOW, MY OWN VIEW WITH THE FALLACIES THAT I THINK WE RUN UP THE READOUT FALLACY. THE READOUT FALLACY IS THE BUCK STOPS WITH THE BRAIN. AND SO WHEN PEOPLE ENCODING, BACK, THAT'S A FALLACY BECAUSE TRANSLATED BACK AGAIN; SO NOTHING IS ENCODED. THE WORD IS WRONG TO USE, YEAH? THE OTHER IS THE THING. WHEN PEOPLE HAVE GOT CONSCIOUSNESS AS THOUGH IT'S WITH, YOU KNOW, WHEN REALLY IT'S SOMETHING, IT'S A VERB, IF AND I THINK THIS IS SO CLEARLY, AS A SCIENTIST, PROBLEM OF HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH TO OUR TRADE, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T MEASURE. TO MAKE PROGRESS ON FIRST WE NEED A CLEAR FOLLOWED BY SPECIFIC INSTANCES WHAT WOULD THEN FOLLOW? BRAIN ACTIVITIES THAT I GO TO PASADENA, CALIFORNIA, NEUROSCIENTIST WHO HAS &quot;NEURAL CORRELATES OF CHRISTOF, I WOULD HAVE NEVER CAL TECH WOULD BE CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE AS RENE DESCARTES IN THE MOST PHILOSOPHY SAID I AM CONSCIOUS THEREFORE I AM. SO I THINK IT'S A LEGITIMATE IF WE REALLY WANT TO HAVE UNIVERSE WE HAVE TO GIVEN ITS CENTRAL ASPECTS. AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT LAST TWO DECADES. FRANCES CRICK, THE AND WITH WHOM I HE WAS A PROFOUNDLY INTERESTED MADE A PREDICTION. SO A CORTEX IS A SHEET OF IT'S REALLY ESSENTIALLY FOR OUR PERCEPTION AND CONSCIOUSNESS REGIONS, PERHAPS AT LEAST A THE BEST UNDERSTOOD ONE IS THE IT'S CALLED IT'S A TERMIOUS SO ESSENTIALLY THE VISUAL THROUGH A RELAY STATION OF THE HEAD. AND IT'S CLEARLY INVOLVED IN STICK YOU IN A MAGNET AND WHEN PART OF THE BRAIN LIGHTS UP. BUT NOW YOU CAN ASK A QUESTION. TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THE NEURONS ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR AND WE HYPOTHESIZED AT THE TIME, DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR SO IT TURNS OUT THAT THE THAT WHETHER IT'S FOR WE DON'T KNOW, BUT YOU CAN WHAT YOU CAN DO, YOU AND IT'S SORT OF A WHERE THE PERSON IS LOOKING AT PERSON IS SEEING IT AND WHAT YOU CAN SHOW THAT WHETHER MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE PRIMARY VISUAL CORTEX. BUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU DIFFERENCE TO THE SIGNAL IN OTHER WORDS, YES, PRIMARY PROCESSING AND TAKING IN THE ATTEND OR NOT ATTEND MAKES A BUT WHETHER YOU ARE CONSCIOUS OR OF NEURONS IN THAT SEEMS TO BE THE CONSCIOUS YOU OR WHEN I SEE THE RED GENERATED IN A DIFFERENT SO IT SEEMS THEN THAT A SMALL PART OF THE BRAIN? WE DON'T KNOW HOW SMALL. I MEAN, IT MAY TURN OUT TO BE THAT'S INVOLVED MAY BE LARGE. IT MAY BE AT ANY GIVEN POINT IN THE GENERAL POINT IS NOT ALL IMPORTANT FOR CONSCIOUSNESS. SOME PART OF THE BRAIN RELATIONSHIP WITH AND B, THAT YOU CAN MAKE THESE ANCIENT QUESTIONS. YOU'RE NOT CONDEMNED FOR, YOU DO YOUR ARM CHAIR - - PHILOSOPHY. PHILOSOPHY, CORRECT... WE ARE LEARNING WHAT IN CONSCIOUSNESS - BECAUSE CONSCIOUSNESS IS IMPOSSIBLE. BUT IS THIS BRAIN ACTIVITY MEANING THAT THIS BRAIN OR CAN GENERATE, CONSCIOUSNESS. I REMAIN WITH THE QUESTION CHRISTOF'S &quot;BRAIN CIRCUITS&quot; OR CAN CONSCIOUSNESS BE EXPLAINED AM I REASONING IN A CIRCLE? TRYING TO EXPLAIN CONSCIOUSNESS &quot;WHAT IS CONSCIOUSNESS?&quot; QUESTION BY BRAIN ACTIVITY? HOW ELSE TO WHAT ABOUT THE WHAT CAN WE LEARN CONSCIOUSNESS IN CHILDREN? I GO BACK TO OXFORD, TO MEET FROM THE UNIVERSITY BRUCE, YOU TALK TO CHILDREN, WHAT CAN WE LEARN ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT CHILDREN THAT'S NEVER REALLY BEEN TRUE. I THINK IN THE WORK I DO WE TRY BUT OBVIOUSLY CONSCIOUSNESS IS WHAT WE ARE MOST FAMILIAR WITH. SO, THERE ARE DIFFERENT THERE'S A CONSCIOUSNESS OKAY, THAT'S THE EXPERIENCE YOU'RE LISTENING TO ME. IT'S FRAGMENTARY AND ONLY LASTS IT FADES, OKAY. UNLESS YOU REALLY ACTIVELY TRY THEN IT BECOMES A MEMORY. BUT IF I ASKED YOU TO REFLECT CONSCIOUSNESS EXPERIENCES, YOUR PERSONAL HISTORY. NOW, I DON'T REALLY THINK INFANT CAN HAVE MUCH THAT MUST BE AN IN FACT, VERY FEW CHILDREN THEIR SECOND BIRTHDAY. BUT FROM ABOUT 3 YEARS ONWARDS, OF SCRIPT ABOUT THINGS I THINK YOU NEED TO HAVE I THINK YOU NEED TO HAVE A SENSE AS A CHARACTER, IN ORDER TO INTO A MEANINGFUL STORY. YOU MAKE THE CLAIM THAT EVEN THIS FIRST ELEMENT OF HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? WELL IN THE WAY WE CAN DO EXPERIMENTS TO THAT'S THIS BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE STIMULUS, YOU INITIALLY SHOW BUT IF YOU REPEAT THE EXPOSURE JUST SORT OF FLATTENS OUT. SO THIS IS A WAY THAT BUT THIS NOTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHAT DO I DO - THESE ARE SORT OF NOTIONS OF SELF AND HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED. BUT MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY TALK AS AN ADULT IN IT'S FULLY FIGURE OUT HOW THIS HAPPENS, AS YOU HAVE DONE AND THESE PIECES COMING TOGETHER, THAT'S RIGHT. AND OF COURSE THE WAY THAT DEPENDS ON THE WAY NOW A CHILD OF 2 OR 3 YEARS EGOCENTRIC VIEW OF THE WORLD. THEY DON'T HAVE A VERY PEOPLE'S PERSPECTIVES SO IF I AN EVENT THAT HAPPENED, YOU SAY, I THOUGHT THIS SO YOU'VE ALREADY GOT A VERY NOTION OF OTHER SO IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ALL THAT YOU CONCEIVE THE WORLD WHAT YOU REMEMBERED. SO IT MUST BE CHANGING BECAUSE PERCEIVE THE WORLD IN WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF A AGE AND ANOTHER AGE AND THERE IS A PHENOMENON YOU KNOW, IT COULD BE THE CASE MIND, THEN YOU DON'T HAVE PERSON'S PERSPECTIVE, ANYONE WHO'S EVER TALKED TO A HAVE THIS KIND OF VERY NOW AROUND ABOUT 3 TO 4 YEARS TRANSITION WHERE CHILDREN START HAVE DIFFERENT MENTAL STATES. THEY ACQUIRE NOW WITH THAT KIND OF SUDDEN WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE THINKING. THAT THEY MAY THEY MAY THINK SOMETHING IS AND THEN OF COURSE IF YOU CAN OF MIND, THEN YOU CAN MANIPULATE THEY MIGHT DO NEXT. THE MORE YOU UNDERSTAND INFORMATION YOU'VE GOT TO STORIES AND MEANINGFUL I THINK THE CONSCIOUSNESS IS. CHILDREN ARE LITTLE LABS IT'S REMARKABLE TO SEE 3 &quot;THEORY OF MIND&quot; - TAKE ANOTHER ADULTS, OBVIOUSLY, HAVE MORE MAKE A MIND. BUT ARE THESE ELEMENTS OF OR OF COGNITION GENERALLY? COGNITION IS THE FULL SPECTRUM CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE SUBJECTIVE INNER MENTAL MOVIE BUT IS CONSCIOUSNESS CAN CONSCIOUSNESS CAN CONSCIOUSNESS BE I GO TO TALLAHASSEE, TO MEET SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGIST, ROY, THE CONCEPT OF ME FOR DECADES. NORMALLY I TALK TO PHILOSOPHERS WITH A THEOLOGIAN THROWN BUT I'VE NOT TALKED TO A HAVE I BEEN ERRING? I THINK THE WAY WE'VE APPROACHED WITH IT, THE PHILOSOPHERS AS THE COGNITIVE PEOPLE; THEY TEND TO THINK ALMOST WHAT WOULD I NEED TO WHAT IS ITS FUNCTION THERE? WHAT I THINK IS CRUCIAL AND THAT PROBABLY EVOLVED FOR SOCIAL TO EACH OTHER. THERE ARE MANY CREATIVE WHAT DO WE NEED CONSCIOUSNESS GET SOME BEHAVIOR, THIS ARE NOT CONSCIOUS. WE USED TO THINK YOU NEEDED THAT'S CLEARLY NOT TRUE ANYMORE. BUT NOBODY'S BEEN ABLE WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS. WHAT REALLY SET OUR SPECIES OFF THAT DEFINES US AS HUMAN WAS NOT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS COMMUNICATION. AND COMMUNICATION STARTED SOME OF THE ANIMALS DEVELOPED OTHER WAS DOING FROM IT'S LIKE MOTHER NATURE GO SOMEWHERE, AND COMMUNICATING TO OURSELVES. THAT I THINK IS WHAT 'CAUSE CONSCIOUSNESS IS A SEQUENCES OF THOUGHT. SO WE START IT'S A PLACE WHERE YOU STATES OF OTHERS. THERE'S LOTS OF LEARNING. LEARNING EVERYWHERE IN NATURE. BUT NOT TEACHING, BECAUSE I KNOW SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T, SO IT MEANS ME KNOWING THAT THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY: CONSCIOUSNESS BUMPS THOUGHTS IN THE MIND CAN CAUSE HAVE TO BE CONSCIOUS? WHAT'S THE BENEFIT? I CAN THINK, DON'T PUT MY HAND MY HAND IN THE FIRE, BUT WHY DOES THAT UNCONSCIOUS THOUGHTS A ROBOT CAN SAY, SO, THAT'S A VERY HARD PROBLEM FAIL ON THERE. BUT, IT'S VERY EASY TO MAKE AN TELL OTHERS MY THOUGHTS. SO I CAN TELL MY CHILDREN DON'T THEN MY REPRODUCTIVE I PASS ON MY GENES. SO THE VALUE OF CONSCIOUSNESS ONCE YOU ESTABLISH AN THAN WHEN YOU'RE TRYING WE CAN'T REALLY IMAGINE WHAT WITHOUT CULTURE, AND IT'S A DEEP WOULD HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS BECAUSE REPRESENT THINGS YOU CAN'T GET YOU HAVE TO HAVE SO YOUR ABILITY TO THINK HERE AND NOW. MOST ANIMALS JUST LIVE IN THE THEY SEE, AND WE CAN RESPOND TO THINGS AND CONSCIOUSNESS CONSCIOUSNESS ENABLES US TO THUS TO ACT IN FOR CENTURIES, THE TERRITORY OF PHILOSOPHERS WHO DEFENDED PRECISION AND OCCASIONAL FURY. THEN NEUROSCIENTISTS ARRIVED, EXPLANATION WITH THE BUT STILL, THE MYSTERY OF HOW ON EARTH CAN INNER SPARKS AND CHEMICALS? SO OTHERS MOVED IN. DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGISTS. SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGISTS. HERE'S A CURRENT STATUS REPORT: UNCERTAINTY AND AMBIGUITY - SURELY, THE COMPLEXITY CONSCIOUSNESS REQUIRES AND SOCIAL INTERACTION. BUT, UNLESS WE CAN EXPLAIN AWARENESS&quot; - WE CANNOT FULLY &quot;WHAT IS CONSCIOUSNESS?&quot; AND WE ARE NO... CLOSER TO TRUTH. FOR COMPLETE INTERVIEWS PLEASE VISIT
