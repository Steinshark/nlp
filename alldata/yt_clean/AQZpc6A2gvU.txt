Arizona university. Geoff: A member of the -- nato and the European union is throwing out the results of an election. That's what happened in Romania, a country vital to Ukraine's efforts against Russia and hosts U.S. Troops. Romania's constitution annulled the results because of what the city -- sitting government calls a vast effort in service of the candidacy of someone who is pro-Russian. &gt;&gt; In 2024, when a Romanian strongman wants to prove his manhood, he goes on tiktok. His opponents say if this campaign looks like the Kremlin's playbook is because he admires Vladimir Putin. &gt;&gt; He is a leader. He loves his country. Ukraine is an invented state. &gt;&gt; And dabbles in conspiracy theories. &gt;&gt; Did man reach the moon? I don't think so. &gt;&gt; He was largely unknown, one of 14 candidates running in Romania's presidential election. On November 5, he pulled under 1%. Three weeks later, he won the first round with 23%. . For the first time in the country's history, they declassified intelligence documents that describe a campaign to circumvent Romanian law to boost his popularity. The government says that campaign relied heavily on a coordinated popularity boosting campaign on tiktok. Romanian intelligence says thousands of tiktok accounts activated before the election and &quot;The activity of the accounts would have been coordinated by a state after&gt; -- state actor.&quot; &gt;&gt; Georgescu was supported by a state that is described as the most significant threat to nato. &gt;&gt; Romania's ambassador to the United States. &gt;&gt; There are many things that would be shaken if this guy had become president. A puppet in Russia's hands which would be a disaster for our security, for our economy, for our alliances, and for our future. &gt;&gt; Romanian intelligence describes a network of tiktok supporters, some paid by a shell company that soon disappeared, all instructed to post unified messages about what they want out of a leader, a family man who is honest and patriotic. These avoided georgescu's name, skirting tiktok's policy on political content. Instead, they relied on hashtags and bots to leave comments, spreading throughout Romania. &gt;&gt; At least one tiktok account used by a Romanian citizen to promote georgescu on social media was financed with over one million euro. &gt;&gt; The secretary of state, Antony blinken, earlier this week. &gt;&gt; Romanian authorities are uncovering a Russian effort, large and well funded, to influence the recent election. &gt;&gt; Local and U.S. Authorities called out pro-Russian actors influencing recent elections in Romania's neighborhood, Moldova, and using tiktok, in Bulgaria. &gt;&gt; Tiktok needs to step up resources to counter information operations. &gt;&gt; Parliamentarians in Europe challenged tiktok executives. &gt;&gt; 95 content moderators, 6000 in Europe. What were they doing in the elections? &gt;&gt; It goes to our platform, an activity taking place on our platform. We don't know what's happening offline. &gt;&gt; Georgescu described the decision to annul the first round and delay the second round as a state to. &gt;&gt; The rule of law is in an induced coma and justice is subordinated to political orders. &gt;&gt; Some centrist parties also condemned the court ruling and argued popular disaffection with the government opened the door to an outsider's campaign. &gt;&gt; There was a very real networking process of mobilizing disenfranchised groups across the region and across the diaspora. &gt;&gt; This is the director of the German Marshall fund for the black sea region. &gt;&gt; Grievances from the regions, from rural communities, from categories of the public that don't feel they are taken seriously with regard to the decreased standings of --standards of living, with regard to their fears, uncertainties. So there's a lot of fear that the Russian actors are exploding. &gt;&gt; The court decision cannot be appealed. But it has not blocked the appeal georgescu --appeal of georgescu tiktok videos.
