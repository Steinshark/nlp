But then he hears a noise outside. it's Gylfie a barn owl and she wants a The female tawny owl Luna hears the a ferocious flurry of feathers and Gylfie isn't far behind. Now it's Luna's turn to take a look inside. [Music] She seems a bit confused by the changes Luna's connection with Back in 2017 Luna was brought adopted by a surrogate mother in this very spot. Despite her puzzled expression she seems impressed with Tawny owls make their nests in hollow trees and this scrape will be a safe As she leaves she calls to her mate. And when she takes flight, he's quickly in to. [Music] Even male tawny owls have a go at nest scraping. foreign [Music] After this it's not long before [Music] She's scraping again [Music] and even roosting inside. [Music] By mid March, Luna seems ready. She enters the nest at speed [Music] Overnight she's breathing heavily And in the early hours, her first egg is revealed. [Music] It's great to get a better view of the egg [Music] Later on she hears noises outside the nest. Barn owl Finn arrives he is is still looking for a nest site. He seems amazed to find an egg, and gently taps it with his beak. After a brief look at my cameras, Luna returns [Music] and once inside [Music] Crisis averted for now. [Music] In the morning Despite the noise Luna doesn't react. But next door next door in the Ash Stump nest, the female presence. As she takes to the wind, the jackdaw She seems surprised to find a tawny owl inside and takes flight. Despite the commotion Luna keeps her cool. Tawny owls lay eggs every two to three days. And even with disturbance from jackdaws outside, 64 hours later she's laid a second egg.[Music] And then a third 64 hours after. [Music] A clutch of three is now complete. [Music] Tawny owls incubate their eggs Luna broods her clutch by day and at night [Music].Bomber drops in [Music] But a month later in spite of Luna's constant And as the days roll on, I'm starting to To make matters worse the jackdaws have returned. This time starting to bring nesting material into within hours the nest entrance is full of sticks Meanwhile a farmer calls about two owl chicks found on the Their two tawny owlets, they've fallen from but here on the ground the vulnerable to predators, without warmth and food these young hours. There's no choice but to rescue them. The chicks are feeling well and they're We've got Luna whose eggs have failed and these two Luna is still preparing for those eggs to I think she could be the Just have to keep these two in overnight In the morning the tawny owl chicks After another good meal, I think they're in the nest Luna is still trapped, if I To prevent her hurting herself, the her an easy escape. [Music] And now It's not a decision I take lightly. [Music] The nest is ready and the [Music] Along with a few [Music] So the owlets are in the nest and just listen to and hope Luna accepts them. [Music] There's nest entrance, now this might work to our advantage. And Luna is back and she's I wonder what she's going to think when she Here she comes and she's going straight in. Look at that she's brooding them straight It's amazing to see how she's taking them on as her own. I couldn't have hoped for a better outcome. [Music] These rescue tawny owl chicks have just She thinks they've just hatched, but They can regulate their own temperature, but that But there's an unwanted They've blocked Luna inside this nest She gets to work feeding the adopted chicks [Music] But there's still someone else for the Soon her mate Bomber arrives with He wants a closer look. He preens Luna and skirts But she wants him to get food, In the morning Luna looks so content. But just a few days ago this wasn't the case, But after passing a light through them it was Then two tawny owl chicks were found All of these tawny owls were struggling So seeing them accepted by but they're not out of the woods just yet. The jackdaws are back again It looks like their preparing to She didn't react much before, but now she but they quickly force her back inside. [Music] Luna watches the jackdaws But it's not over yet, they return with a vengeance and in a matter of hours this Unable to escape, Luna panics. Without intervention, they will die. So I act, the back of the nest is opened to but now I just have to hope she returns. [Music] The adopted chicks huddle and then after nearly two hours Luna's back. They are so pleased she's returned By night Luna heads out to hunt. [Music] There's so much growing to do they're going to and it's beautiful to listen to them calling. [Music] Under the care of their new parents, the adopted Luna can't believe how fast they've developed. They're already standing and Their personalities are developing digging. [Music] They're so inquisitive and when it flaps its wings for the There's still at least two weeks to go before Luna heads off to hunt [Music] and returns with a huge catch. It's a I've watched Bomber and Luna [Music] But I've never seen them bring one into the nest. At first she stashes it in the entrance. Later on she drags inside. [Music] She carefully feeds each chick in turn. Luna is doing such a great job caring night falls and Luna's out. He even preens his adopted owlets. Soon Luna's back. She calls Bomber to leave, despite She's so protective. It's amazing to see just how These rescued owlets are settled in their new home. A week ago tawny owls Bomber and Luna We decide to name them Dawn and Dusk. [Music] So their now about three weeks old and and stretching its long legs. [Music] Younger chick Dawn shows off it's Dawn's became more mischievous foster mum Luna seems less than Tawny owls are nocturnal and at night Male owl Bomber is first back with food She wants to be the one to feed the This is incredible how possessive to be their main carer.

Yeah so and they can easily be out of the nest branch to branch using these uh very the two owlets out now and this one's the well, which is interesting. Uh but they're Oh yeah their fab, so these rings that we've put and these have all got individual numbers on, so out how old they are, how far they've moved, [Music] [Music] So that's got the owlets rung and it's time to put them back in the nest. [Music] These tawny owlets are called Dawn and Dusk, so now they are about a month old and it won't be long before they fledge. Younger owl Dawn is full of energy Older sibling Dusk watches on bobbing Dusk is becoming more adventurous and Luna the tawny owl chick's adoptive mother, But she's never far and still Her presence seems to give Dusk a confidence boost, and it's magic to watch as Luna steps Even Dawn wants to take the next step The younger owlet seems a bit left out and entertains itself. [Music] Dusk soon decides it's time and it's charming to hear Luna takes flight in search she's soon back with food her mate Bomber has turned up too, owlets but Luna barges through. Bomber patiently waits his turn and as lunar After a tough start in life, it's wonderful And when Lunas finished feeding.

[Music] But the following morning, [Music] And as sunset approaches Dawn makes its way outside with purpose. It's now 24 hours since Dusk left the nest [Music] [Music] Newly fledged rescued tawny owls Dawn and Dusk are out in the trees near my home and they're thriving. Visiting their neighbours the kestrels. [Music] Exploring the area, they rarely returned to the nest during the branching phase. So I have been handed three more rescued tawny owl chicks. They are different ages and have Right this is the smallest owl. All three I think it must have been quite hungry, the plan is on. I've done this many times before, giving them It's a pretty windy day up here today, so it's a owlets in as quickly as possible. So this is and next is this one.
