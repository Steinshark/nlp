Hi there, it's Paik Jong-won. [Cabbage pancake] [made with only eggs and cabbage!] [Let's sell it = Greatest compliment] It's way better than kyabetsu yaki! [Paik's Cuisine] Today we're going to use a cabbage which I'm sure you all have at home. Every fridge in every home has a cabbage. A cabbage is crunchy when you eat it raw and has its unique fragrance but it turns sweet when you cook it. Hence in nearby country like China they would mince the cabbage roll it into balls and deep fry it. So they usually sell the deep fried cabbage. As for Japan they sell what is called kyabetsu yaki. Kyabetsu. That's how Japanese call a cabbage. They grill a cabbage into kyabetsu yaki and sell it on the street like Okonomiyaki in the market. Hence, today I will cook a cabbage pancake. I see, that's what we'd call it in Korean. It's hilarious how it sounds lackluster when I say it in Korean. When you say kyabetsu yaki it sounds like a dish but... The foreign language just makes it sound decent. Nothing to it, really. On the other hand when you say kyabetsu yaki to Japanese it would feel like saying a cabbage pancake to us. And when you say cabbage pancake to Japanese they'll think it's a stunning Korean cuisine. [A cabbage / Around 1,500 won] If there is a leftover cabbage in the fridge, you can use that. [Try it if you have] Buying a whole cabbage just to cook this is foolish. But hey, there are many fools [Fools for cooks] Try it out. Once you try it, you'll be more confident. [Chapter 1. Chop the cabbage!] Slice thinly just as you normally would cut vegetables. About three paper cups? One. [Three cups of chopped cabbage] [About this much] And for the green onions you can use what you have at home. You can also chop into small pieces Instead of cutting it lengthwise. [Green onion 1/2 / (Chop)] The more green onion, the better it tastes. But when you add it as much as the cabbage it'll turn into a green onion pancake. About a third of the cabbage amount? Or a quarter? A third? Around that would do. If you have more, you can add. [(Carrot)] I'll slice it up. It gives great color but you can leave it out if you don't have it. Don't you all have a carrot at home? Just use as much as you have! Everyone isn't a fan of it. Am I wrong? Yong-hee isn't eating carrots these days. Mix it like this, and it'll look pretty. After that, put it in the bowl. If you're annoyed to do that don't worry because deep fry batter and pancake mix is all seasoned these days. You can only use this but if you want more seasoning you can add a pinch of salt. [A pinch of salt] It would be even better if you use seasoned salt. [Open] [Add as much pepper as you want] [Mix the ingredients well] Deep fry mix. Maybe around one-third or half a cup. When you pan-fry it it will stick together better with more deep fry or pancake mix. But if you add a lot you'll taste the dough rather than the crunchiness of a cabbage. [Preview] You can add more if you want. [1/3 cup of deep fry mix] [Add] While mixing like this you'll feel whether it would turn out okay or not. If you think they won't stick together well you can add more. Many don't know but it's totally okay to use deep fry mix in place of pancake mix. And vice versa! [Adding more mix] Huh? Why is a spoon here? Who hid it here? [Used to it] When you do it like this both cabbage and carrot have mix on it. See? Without leaving any behind. From here, there are two methods. [Method one / Add eggs first] or for you to appear more technical you can pan-fry it a bit [Method two / Add eggs while grilling] Which method should I take? [Annoyed] [Two eggs] Next you don't have to beat the eggs completely before usage! [Chapter two / Mix with eggs] Add eggs and mix. And if you have eggs to spare you can add another one. But do you see? Here. The mix is left. That's why I added more. I made a mistake. [A little misstep is fine] No need to mix it too much as if you're making a batter. Do it roughly enough to mix. [Mix until you don't see the powder ingredient!] See? It's mixed now. Next. [Chapter three / pan-fry it!] and let it get hot. Make sure you add decent amount of oil. [Add decent amount of oil!] The cooking oil pairs well with the cabbage. I told you to pan-fry it for a long time on low heat but at first don't do it on the low heat but on a heated up pan. After that, we'll turn the heat down and then do it slow. Because the pan is big it will turn thin when you spread wide. The cabbage pancake is better when you fry it thick. We always look for something decent, right? Okay, from here... [Sizzle] [When you pan-fry it thick] Wow, quite thick isn't it? Can I flip such a pancake? Yes. It's okay to fail. From here turn the heat low. Keep it to a minimum. With this... Oh? They are stuck together already. Right? A bit. Stable. They lump together to move around. You need to turn the heat down to the point it doesn't bother you even if you look at it next to it. [Four mins later] As you can see there isn't any issue. Here. It is lifted. See? Way easier than you think. But there is an issue here. As for an expert like me we can flip without making the oils smudge even thought it is swimming in oil. But for you, if you don't be careful you will splash the oil all over the kitchen while cooking the saved up cabbage. Bang! So what you need to do is take a bowl put it here and lessen the oil. [Take out some oil] Again, take it off and flip. There we go. From here you can pour back the oil. [It's safe to flip after taking off the oil!] I know it's annoying but this is the safest method. [Will pan-fry it for 10 more minutes] [(Bored)] [(Stirs)] [(Taps)] I should come back after playing some game. [Manager bored] Let me go and check the text. Keep filming. [Manager that disappeared] [and the table that is cleaned off] [(Peek)] [The kitchen is cleaned] [The secret of Paik Jong-won] Hmph. Oh, I was forgetting about it. I forgot. Where did the flipper go? Why did you cleared it? [(Clean)] Why did you lie when you cleared it out? I'm not done here. And chopsticks? Why did you clear them out too? It's not over. I just took a short break. Got you. When I press it I can see the eggs and batter is cooked through. In Japan they would have a large iron grill set up on the resident area or grocery store to cook and sell these. They would do other things to the point you are worried it might burn. Everyone loves it. I bought one and tried it but it was just so-so. Wait, why am I saying that while cooking it? The taste is so-so. It means it won't make your eyes pop out. Usually when we go on a tour, we'll have Okonomiyaki or Takoyaki. [This only has cabbage and eggs] It's not as tasty as that but if you don't compare it to that it's okay to have. Reasonable price. [Total 15 mins / Cook the pancake fully!] Drain the oil. If you're cooking this for weight loss you will have to drain. [Put mayonnaise on one side] Oh, you shouldn't put this if you're on a diet. [Even teriyaki sauce!] Do you know Baron Ashura an old animation? Half is a man, and half is a lady. Baron Ashura Cabbage Pancake. This side is for those who are on a diet and this is for those who are not. [Paik's Cuisine] [Flap flap] Katsuobushi is alive. It's alive, I say. Not. It is thin, that's all. I also was confused a lot. Since this is so thin it is moving at the flow of air that we can't feel. Don't misunderstand. I know some of you didn't fall for it. But at first, I was like &quot;Huh? What the... Is it alive?&quot; I used to do that. [Blows] When I'm talking in front... [(How can you not zoom into that?)] I entertain myself well. That's how you entertain yourself. First of all [Brown] Do you see? Do you? Is it cooked? [(Shakes head)] [(Don't lie)] [(Peeks)] It is cooked. Don't lie to me. From the camera's point of view. [(Joke)] [It is cooked] [Cut] [When you try it] I did a good job. Delicious. A healthy meal. This menu maximize the sweetness of a cooked cabbage so it's sweet while staying healthy. It's not the sugary sweetness that I usually do but healthy one. [It's unfamiliar] Just eating this would make me feel stuffed and healthy. [Now the part with sauce!] [Let's sell it = Greatest compliment] It's way better than kyabetsu yaki that I tried at the market [Awesome compliment] I just did well. [His way of thinking] I mean those people at the market can't come to try this. [(Joke)] [So good] Really. It's better than Okonomiyaki. [Highly recommended] But don't rush it, you'll fail. Take it slow. If you fail and say it is not cooked inside it's your fault. I'm saying. [Paik Jong-won / Not fair] Cheers. [Enjoy] Try it. It's great.
