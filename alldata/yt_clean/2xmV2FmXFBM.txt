If you're rich, being pregnant can be tons of fun! Everything's just one big game! Check out all the cash!! What's going on out there? Do I look fabulous or what? Check it out! My turn!! Wait, this stuff's not green! Hello? Aw, man!! My stuff's gone! Being poor stinks. I guess I'll settle with this. So unfair!! Isn't this nursery adorable?! Darling? I got the gold stroller, honey! Just like you wanted. AHH!! Wait! No stroller pushing for you, dear. The chauffeur. Nice. We're gonna have fun! Talk to me. Thanks, babe! Need a ride? Practice does make perfect! In you go! Let's go get ice cream!! Look!!! A gold stroller! Never seen one like that before!! I don't even have a regular one. A water jug! Time to get creative. Necessity's the mother of invention after all. Isn't it cute? Time for a little test drive! In you go, little one! Stay warm in there. Ugh, I'm so excited!! Hi there, can I help you? These clothes are all stunning! So many sparkles. Wow!! She sure is pretty... I think I found a winner! Or this one... I feel woozy all of the sudden. Oh good! A big comfy chair! I'd better stay off my feet. It's like a sauna in here!! Huh? OH! Having a hot flash, miss? This air could be colder... You're so right!! I'm feeling a bit better. This plus everting you have. Okay!! This is everything we've got! Anything else I can do? Ugh. That'll be all. This should cover everything. That's a whole lot of cash. All right, time to get a move on. Bye. Wow... What a pretty morning! GAH!! I can't believe I did that!! So much for breakfast. Oh well. This certainly won't work! Somebody help me!! GAH! C'mon... GAH! It fits!! Well, kind of. This store has so much stuff!! Looking for clothes, I see? How about this? Definitely! Five bucks? I don't think so. Try the sale section! Sounds good to me. Wow! I can sure stretch a dollar in here! I'm one rich mama!!! So exciting!!! Whoops!! Didn't see you there... Watch out world, here I come! See ya! Uh-huh... This restaurant's beautiful! Anybody awake in here? Appetizer, miss? Only the best for you. Anything catching your eye? I'll take all of it, thanks! Looks great. Tastes all right. Eh, don't love vegetables. This is more up my alley! A gummy bear!! Wow, that was delicious! You rang? I assume it's main course time? Just clear it all. Understood. Wow, this sure was a waste. It's our best dish too. Alrighty!! Lunch has officially been served!! Looks pretty good, right? Any salt left? It should be fine. It's good! I sure am hungry! This sure hits the spot. Time to do the dishes!! I still could use a little more. Hey, nobody's watching! MMM!! All done!! And I don't have to wash it now! See ya next time!! I'm so efficient!! Ugh, nothing new. Wonder what's on TV. Check out that lady! Thank you, thank you. Wow. That gives me an idea! Ahem... Hello? Yes, right now. Why watch TV when you can have a life performance in your living room? Would it kill her to be more animated? Nope, this way more boring than I thought it'd be. All right, lady, I've heard enough. Ugh. Fine then. Better? What an attitude! Next!! Get a load of these guys! I guess they can hold a tune. But I've heard all I can hear. Okay! Okay, keep it moving. Nice house you got here. Time to bring it down!! I don't hate this!! It's got a good groove!! Yeah, I can definitely handle this!! Take all the money, you deserve it!! Woohoo!!!! Money for everyone!! That was seriously awesome!! I think baby liked it too!! Man, I love this song so much!! You hear it in there, little guy? I know what'll help. It won't fit!! UgH! I want the baby to hear the music!! These are my only headphones!!! NO! Now I have no way to listen! Unless... I got it!! Just need this... And these!! Hope baby likes my voice! I think he does!! That was one exhausting shopping trip. Phew! It wasn't that bad. TV? I'll be in the kitchen. Time to revel in my purchases!! Could you die?! They're just so little!! And in here? He won't wear these for a while. Check these out! The tiniest little shoes!! HEY! They didn't have those at the mall! They're so much cuter than these. Ahh!! Sweetie!! What now? I need those baby shoes! Huh? They are pretty cute. Whatever, get what you want. I'll take a pair. You happy? YES! So happy!! Can we stop shopping now? You got 'em!! See? Wow, such cute stuff in here! And look how tiny!! Does that say 200 bucks? For this? Ugh. These are cute!! And way more affordable. I'll take these please! Okay! Four dollars, please. Not a problem. Or maybe it is... I only have two. I can't afford anything! What about her little shoes? What do you say? I guess that'll work. What a strange woman. If you were pregnant, would you rather be rolling in dough or pinching pennies? Either way, with a baby, lots of love is all you need -- well, until it comes to diapers. Watch these and more when you subscribe to our channel!
