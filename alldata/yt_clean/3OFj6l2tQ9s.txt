Mack now only has three traps remaining to win $1,000,000, You decide to risk the money. - Let's do this. Lights on! This next Our most viewed video is Squid Game So I thought it would be fun with the cookie cutting game Just like in Squid Game, You have to cut out the shape shape on the scanner. If you break the cookie, it won't fit in the circle And I lose everything. But if it's the exact same size, and you have to do it three more times How much time to have? There is no time limit. - Thank God. - Thank God! Some of these challenges, he takes an hour. so I might give you one. - No, don't give me a time limit. Okay. A strategy. Jimmy, And that's going to melt the sugar. And then ideally, I can poke this So your strategy is Squid Games. That's the way to put it. - Mack. - I didn't touch you. What about my croc? No. Well, now I don't have a shoe. It's the only way to teach you, man. All right, here we go. It's taking forever. I understand that this money Me? This will change my life. So I'm going to take my sweet time You can take your sweet time. Just the next one. I'm probably going put a time limit. No! Halfway done. That's it, right? Okay, put it there. You're good. Light's on. He's going to solve the triangle But after the triangle is a star Okay. Cookie. Also, wait, wait. Before you open it. One second. Oh, no, I'll replace that because the money In case you forgot what you're - Part of it's really far away. Okay. You can proceed. For the record, - Really? At this point see how sad you are I would actually highly recommend That's what I thought after That's what you thought after every trap, But yet, we're here. Wow, that's just sliding off. Last piece. Oh my gosh. I think he did it. Okay. Walk on in here. Cookie us. Now comes the real challenge. The hardest shape. If I win this, I don't think All right, how about this? Cut this stupid umbrella out and then For my sanity, dude. Okay. Oh, and by the way, - Okay, it's ticking right now? 9 minutes and 50 seconds I love you. I will not be speaking to you I completely understand $800,000 is on the line. Give me a dollarbill, like a stack money. Stack, okay. He's using the money as a hammer. They didn't do that in Squid Game. I've never felt more intensity This is very, very difficult. I don't know what I'm going to do 5 minutes remain. Honestly, I think you can do this. I feel like Shoe hammer Dude, I'm just making no progress. 2 minutes. He's starting to break it off. He's starting to pull pieces of. Just so you know, Wait, what just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. And I had it all. It's $700,000. I don't know why I did Would it have hurt less So much less. Well, here, come on buddy. Come on. Let's stand up. Let it be known. If you're in a MrBeast video... quit while you're ahead. I'll be honest, guys. This was pretty sad.
