It's not a nine to five job. It's not a five day a week job. It's a seven day a week job. [upbeat music continues] [pool balls clacking] [gentle music] - [Narrator] For Pistone, it was slow and repetitive work. - Did I enjoy it? I endured it, I put it I'm not really a bar guy, I don't drink. I mean, you know, I'll drink one beer, maybe one glass of wine. I wasn't in love with To me, it was part of my job. [suspenseful music] - [Narrator] Finally, after six months of targeting the bars of Manhattan, Pistone thought that his face and he decided to try whom he suspected had - I finally feel, well, Come in one night and hey Okay, we start talking, and I had a package of diamonds and I said, I need X say $10,000.

[suspenseful music] - Now he knows that, you know what I mean, I don't have to spell it out you know, and that's it, went from there. [upbeat music] - [Narrator] Over the next few months, the barman started to invite Donnie out, introducing him to numerous contacts. - The place we went to were you know, gambling and after hours. And he would introduce me, - [Narrator] Pistone was being to all sorts of shadowy people. But one introduction in particular will become very significant. The man was known as Jilly, and was not only a fence but was what the mob called a made guy. - Made, straightened out, All those terms mean the same thing. You've been officially inducted into a particular mafia family. [energetic music] - [Narrator] Now, news that with a made mafia member changed the entire The FBI seized the opportunity and encouraged Pistone to get Pistone used all that he to convince them that but they wanted to see - You have to be an earner.

You have to see that I had - [Narrator] Suddenly of a lot more jewelry from - In the operation as a jewel thief, I mean, I wasn't going out robbing, robbing Tiffany's to get the jewels. Any jewelry that I brought It was confiscated jewelry You know, there was jewelry Other times I would bring around watches. - [Narrator] As Pistone began handing over more and more jewelry, it seemed that he was convincing them that he was a genuine thief. [suspenseful music building] But then some of the gang members started asking for his help Breaking into homes, something he was reluctant - They'd asked me, you know, Can you get in?&quot; You know, and a couple times I said, &quot;No, I can't bypass that alarm system. I can't, you know, I I can't do the this [suspenseful music] - [Narrator] Pistone by Jilly at his club Frankie and Patsy. - They locked the door. Patsy puts his gun on the table, and he said, &quot;You know, Donnie,&quot; he says, &quot;unless you convince me that you're a really great jewel thief,&quot; he said, &quot;the only way is rolled up in that rug.&quot; [suspenseful music] - [Narrator] They began on every detail of his past. - Where are you from? Who [tense music] - [Narrator] The questioning Eventually, Jilly convinced called a halt to the meeting. But then as Frankie and Pistone took a massive gamble - When somebody calls you gotta be mad. And the only thing they're is some kind of force. So I hit Frankie. [suspenseful, action music] Patsy jumps on me, he starts punching me, starts beating me. Well, I can't do anything You can't hit a made guy, So I just keep hitting Frankie. Then finally, they break it up. - [Narrator] The fight didn't just make him seem a credible gangster, but it also gave Pistone the excuse to distance himself from of Jilly's crew. - I went to Jilly I said, Jilly, you know, all due respect, but I with these guys anymore. If they have something lined they have something they don't even tell me about it. [suspenseful music] - [Narrator] Believing Jilly introduced him to some major figures from another mafia family, the Bonannos. First he met Tony Mirra.

And I gained a lot of - [Narrator] Through Mirra and Ruggiero, Pistone was able to shine a torch on the inner workings of a mafia family. Something that the FBI, until then, had known surprisingly little about. - He could recount to us He could recount what rackets He could recount what's The people he was involved You know, who was gonna kill [jail door clanging shut] - [Narrator] In 1978, the operation had a major breakthrough. Tony Mirra was jailed and Lefty Ruggiero seized an opportunity to cash in on Pistone's and made him an offer he couldn't refuse. [tense music] Pistone would operate exclusively under Lefty as his partner, he would now be much more closely involved in Bonanno family business. [suspenseful music] And critically, Lefty was part of a crew run by one of the most powerful captains in the Bonanno family, Dominick [camera shutter snapping] - Sonny Black was an effective, [camera shutter snapping] He had about 15 to 20 members in his crew. About 10 or 12 made guys, 20 or 30 other well known will hang around and work with the family. He dressed effectively like the consummate or quintessential mobster.

[suspenseful music continues] [upbeat music] - [Narrator] Pistone was with Sonny Black at his social club, The Motion Lounge in Brooklyn. [upbeat music continues] - The every day in the not as exciting as you might think. You know, you might meet up at 10, 11 o'clock in the morning. You hang out at the social club all day and you know, your conversation is about what you're gonna rob, who's stealing from you, how much money you're how much money you're It's a steady grind every day. [camera shutter snapping] - [Narrator] Thanks to Pistone, they had never anticipated. They had an agent as an active member in a major crew in the New York Mafia. - There was a lot of excitement because up to this point, nobody had infiltrated to the point that they were running around [funky music] - [Narrator] Pistone was to gather material on a wide [camera shutter snapping] - At this stage, I was gathering a lot of intelligence information, drug deals, extortion, hijacking, political corruption, politicians, law enforcement people that were corrupt. So it was a miriad of information. [suspenseful music] - But more than that, he was able to learn who in the Bonanno family and giving the FBI names - I was finding out the structure of the family, who was basically running the family. So a lot of it had to do that we didn't know by and that we weren't We showed we can go after and get the upper versus the guys on the bottom - [Narrator] Pistone's intelligence was helping the FBI build of not just how the but the whole mafia. [suspenseful music continues] And what emerged was how much were in fact cooperating with each other. - You came to realize that this was not a These folks were working together. They might have been you know, for work purposes But in the scheme of things, sharing these criminal activities. [dramatic music] - [Narrator] And Pistone's to just the Mafia in New York. With his strong credibility, he could now vouch for and instigate connections as far away as Los Angeles. In Milwaukee he was so successful, he even managed to set with the mob boss there. The first time an FBI agent had sat down with such a high ranking mobster. [dramatic music fades] [upbeat music] In Florida also, the to infiltrate the mafia. They had set up a club, the King's Court, which they had hoped would be a beacon for Florida's mobsters. [upbeat music continues] Pistone saw a way to help the operation by suggesting that Sonny Black The idea appealed to Sonny, and he sent Pistone and Lefty [funky music] Pistone now discovered that Lefty had hardly ever - Everybody thinks that mob guys are so worldly and they know everything. I mean, they're really parochial, and Lefty was no different. You know, had no idea how to make a plane reservation, you know? Because a lot of time, most of the time when they wanted to go somewhere, the plane tickets were, you know, back in the day before the computers, it was all they were stolen, you know, from travel agents. [funky music continues] [suspenseful music] - [Narrator] When Lefty saw the club, he reported favorably back to Sonny. And Sonny liked what he heard. But to operate in Florida, Sonny Black would still of the local mafia, headed - That's when Sonny to get a meeting with Trafficante. - [Narrator] Sonny flew to to propose running illegal together from the club. Trafficante agreed to the deal. It was a breathtaking - Here we got two major bosses that we married up together to become involved in illegal activities with, I mean, unheard of. So that was a big thing. [suspenseful music] - The FBI had the back office of the King's Court fully installed with microphones and cameras. - The King's Court was but it was only in the because the patrons were regular people who didn't know it was an FBI operation. [suspenseful music continues] - [Narrator] Pistone and started to stage drug deals - Nobody wants you in that town. With this. I can walk into any [beep] place in this [beep] town. - [Narrator] It was a gold mine But for the Bonannos, it was a [upbeat music] And Sonny Black loved it. - Every time you went I mean, it was a big hit and everybody that would in there was a citizen, you know? So the club was making money. We were doing illegal and illegal bingo games, because of the elderly population, you can make a lot of money running bingo because they were taking [upbeat music continues] - [Narrator] Pistone was So much so that Sonny asked him to head up the operation in Florida. But more importantly for the FBI, in another promotion for Pistone, he no longer had to but would answer directly to Sonny Black. [upbeat music continues] Pistone now had access to one of the most important Nothing like this had [eerie music] Now, based in Florida, on Pistone would even stay at Sonny's house and they would spend hours feeding Sonny's racing - I got to know Sonny Black pretty good. And although he, you know, although he was a stone Sonny was the kind of guy I mean, you know, he would talk about the gambling, the drugs. He would talk about you know, who's the power in the family. But you could also have [eerie music continues] He loved those pigeons. You know, like I said, and he'd feed 'em and change their water and gimme a history lessons on pigeons. I mean, I never listened I had told the FBI guys when those pigeon coops come down, you can say goodbye to Sonny Black. You know he's gone. [eerie music continues] - [Narrator] Pistone's close now gave him even more access to information within the mafia. He discovered that one recent Sicilian immigrants known as Zips, were enormous drug importers. They used a series of pizza restaurants to distribute the drugs. - The Zips were Sicilians brought over to run the pizza shops New York and Pennsylvania, not only to distribute the heroin, but to use these Zips for murders and anything else that - [Narrator] Based on the FBI launched a major investigation into the Zips pizza restaurant drug trade. But they couldn't act on it immediately, because if Pistone's identity he would be killed instantly. [suspenseful music] - Every day going to work like that, knowing he could easily and his life would've been worthless. And yet he did it for years. - As long as the person's undercover, you can't do anything until they surface or you jeopardize them. - [Narrator] But in fact, by now, there was a far more serious [suspenseful music continues] [camera shutter snapping] Tony Mirra, Pistone's was released from jail and furious that Pistone was earning money He wanted revenge. - Well, you have to remember, and envy in the mob. Mirra gets outta jail, and he's jealous because he thinks I'm and because I'm real close to Sonny Black. So he goes and he goes to his captain and says that I should be because he's the one - [Narrator] But Sonny, keen to keep his cut was reluctant to pass him back to Mirra. - Mirra goes to Sonny, and [suspenseful music continues] - [Narrator] Mirra then took and called for the other Cappos Lefty and Sunny were called on to defend their claim on Pistone in a series of meetings. [suspenseful music continues] Lefty would phone Pistone after each one to let him know what was happening, and Pistone would secretly - [Ruggiero] Hey, Donnie, I had a four and a half hour - So what? - Hey Donnie, don't say for what? - [Pistone] For what? You know I don't even know what - [Ruggiero] I won you - Well, that's right. I'm not giving you up and so has Sonny. We own Donnie and we're giving up Rocky. Now you give up my prick I says. I warned you, I'm not giving - [Pistone] Well how does - [Ruggiero] Where does he stand? He's not giving you up. Not giving up, ain't nobody having you. - [Pistone] Hey, I don't [air wooshing] - [Narrator] Sonny Black and Lefty won, and got to keep Pistone as their own. But Mirra wasn't finished yet. And in an act of revenge, that would instantly [suspenseful music] - So he figures, well, nobody's gonna have them. So then what Mirra does is he puts in the beef with all the captains that I stole $250,000 in a drug deal. And you know, that's a no-no, you don't steal money from the family. - [Narrator] The severity demanded a series of high A sit down was in effect a trial.

I mean, it's not like, you know, they're gonna give you, you know, we're gonna give you a month to get your affairs in order. - [Ruggiero] Rocky admitted - [Pistone] Who did Rocky tell that to? - [Ruggiero] Anthony Mirra and his men, don't you understand? - He's a lying son of a- - Fucking jerk off! - He's a lying son of... he's lying, Left. - [Ruggiero] I don't give a fuck. - [Pistone] He's a liar, I never cut any junk money up with him. - [Ruggiero] That don't fucking count. - [Pistone] So why's this - [Ruggiero] He wants you bad. - [Pistone] So what do we do now? - [Ruggiero] I don't give - I ain't afraid of anybody. - [Ruggiero] You can't help me out. I have to handle this, without out. - [Pistone] And I ain't When's this thing all - [Ruggiero] It ain't gonna end. [suspenseful music] - [Narrator] Sonny spent three Eventually his life was spared.
