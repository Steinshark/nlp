[beep] -Hello, Billy. Greetings, Cowie. Good afternoon, Baby Bot. It is good to see you. -[chirping] -Oops, sorry, Billy. Launching translation. -[chirping] -You come from a long line of robots, Baby Bot, each designed to do different things. Behold, this is one of the first robots, called an automaton. It was made of metal and powered by steam, which made it super strong. [mechanical sounds] [steam] -[giggling] [steam] -Yay. -[chirping] -Automatons could only do one thing at a time, but not for long. -[chooo!] -Soon, robots became more advanced, like this arm bot, that builds cars. -[running] [tripping] Oh. [mechanical sounds] -[giggling] -[chirping] -[giggling] -Eventually, robots were able to go through complex obstacle courses. [running] [cheering] [running] [crashing] [buzz] -[giggling] [mechanical sounds] [sad music] -[sighs] [door opening] -And last but not least, the best of the best, the creme of the crop, the greatest robot in history. This robot can laugh and dance. -I can do that. -And sing. -[gasps] I can do that too. -And love. -[giggling] -[gasps] I am the best robot? -Of course, you are, Baby Bot. -Me? -[chirping] [kiss] -How touching. -We made you with love. -Wow. Yay. [laughing] . [tap dancing] La, la, la. La, la, la, la, la. -Beautiful. [applause] [cheering] I know nothing. [screaming] Run, Baby Bot, the bee wants to sting us. [angry buzz] Got you. We got the bee. We catch bee. [afraid buzz] Hmm. Bees don't usually bother us if we don't bother them. Did you do anything to this bee? No. We just wanted to play with the pinata. Pinata. Pinata. Pinata. Then, for no reason, a bee started chasing us. Bad, bad bee. Bees are not bad. Bees are amazing. Don't you know anything about bees? I know nothing. I can fix that. Billy, didn't you have a machine that can turn us all into bees? [chirping] Machine. Perfect. This machine can turn us all into bees. For how long was it, Billy? [chirping] Okay, cool. We have three minutes to see how incredible bees really are. Look at me. I can fly. Wow, everything is so big. Check it out. We are worker bees and that means we have a lot of work to do. [cock-a-doodle-doo] Every day we fly from flower to flower collecting pollen and nectar. [laughs] The pollen tickles. Right. Bees carry pollen from one plant to the next plant. Flowers, fruits, and vegetables. Wow, that's a big job. Exactly. The bees do tons of work to help the planet and everyone who lives here. Then they all come back to the hive which is their home. Behold, the beehive. [busy buzz] Cool. Inside the hive, they all served the queen bee. Hello, Your Highness. The bees take all the pollen and nectar they collected that day and turn it into honey. Wow. Bees are so cool. They help us, and they make delicious honey. Honey! Mm, honey. Uh-oh, our time is almost up. We got to get out of here before we turn into our real selves. We could destroy the hive. We got to go. Honey. Well, after just one more taste of honey. We are so sorry. We never should have trapped you. Wait, Elliot. Oh, no. Elliot will break the hive. Baby Bot Bee will save the hive. [music] Don't be scared, little bee. It's me. Fly, fly, little bee. Farewell, bee, I hope you will forgive us. [gasp] Friends! Honey. Honey! I know bee. [laughter] Who's ready to rhyme? Me! Cowy was walking Down by the lake When she met a snake Getting ready to bake. A little while later The snake pulled out a cake. Lake, snake, bake, cake Lake, snake, bake, cake It's rhyme time. It's rhyme time. Rhyming is cool When we're in the pool. It's rhyme time. It's rhyme time. Rhyming is fun For everyone! Cowy was taking a beautiful hike When she saw a panda Riding a bike. Then she saw a rose Growing a nose. Hike, bike, rose, nose Hike, bike, rose, nose It's rhyme time. It's rhyme time. Rhyming is fun When we're in the sun. It's rhyme time. It's rhyme time. Rhyming is fun For everyone! Cowy and her rocket Were flying up to space When she flew by the moon It made a silly face. Wow, thought Cowy. This is such a crazy place. Space, face, place, moon No! Moon doesn't rhyme with space. Okay, you're right! How about space, face, place, race? Space, face, place, race Did that rhyme? Yes! It's rhyme time. It's rhyme time. Rhyming is great, But don't be late. It's rhyme time. It's rhyme time. Rhyming is fun For everyone! Baby Bot. [music] Good morning. Morning. [music] [sings]. Hi, Billy! Oh! What's that?! Why is the lady crying, Billy? Is she hurt?! [shushes across the audience] Ma'am, are you okay?! Don't cry. Do you want to play? I have a ball. You are ruining the opera. Can't you keep quiet and let us enjoy the music? Music? What is music? Don't you know anything about music? I know nothing! but I can learn. Machines can't learn music. [music] What's wrong, Baby Bot? The man says I can't learn music because I'm a machine. No way. You're not a machine, you're Baby Bot. [smooches] Do you want me to teach you everything I know about music? Yes. Music is so rad. It makes you relax or it makes you want to dance. It can make you happy or it can make you sad. Music is amazing and this is the reason why. [drums] Samba, my favorite style to dance to. [music] Sometimes, I like wilder music like rock. [music] Yes, that was fun! And now, get ready for some classical music. [music] [applause] Wow. There are even more types of music, Baby Bot. From polka to techno. From flamenco to jazz, and there are many, many more. What's your favorite? All of them. I know music. I know music, I do. Billy! I know music!! Music. A-One. A-two. A-one, two, three, four. [music] [drums] [drums] [cheering] I know nothing! Flower, flower, flower, flower. A flower for Elliot. Are you sleeping? Hello, Baby Bot. Oh! Thank you so much. What a beautiful sunflower. Actually, Baby Bot, I wasn't sleeping. I was enjoying some sun. The sun? Yes. That is the sun. [music] Big! [screams] Baby Bot? [cries] It burns. [cries] Bad sun. You touched the sun? Yes. Bad sun. No, Baby Bot. The sun isn't bad. The sun is great. You don't know anything about the sun? I know nothing! I'll enlighten you! You see, Baby Bot? We live in the solar system. The solar system? Exactly. The Earth and all the other planets revolve around one star. The Sun. That's right, Baby Bot, the sun is our star, and it gives us light and warmth. Without the sun, there would be no light on Earth, and it would be very cold. Imagine that! I make light too. But the sun lights up the whole planet. Can you do that? [background noise] No. Sunshine is great, Baby Bot. It makes us feel happy! [raining] See how sad everything is when there's no sun? Who could be happy in weather like this? La la la. La la la la la. [chuckles] Well... except for Cowy. I don't like the sun. Oh no! Poor flower. Oh... the sunflower, it's wilting. Of course! [music] [chuckles] Yeah! The sun gives light. Without the sun, there would be no animals, no plants and no friends. The sun is good. The sun, friend. Stop! The sun is great, but very strong. We have to be careful to stay safe. Ready? Ready. Drink water. Check. Wear cool sunglasses. To protect our eyes! Check. Wear sunscreen. For our skin! Check. Wear a hat. To protect our heads! Check. That's it! Sun, friend! No! Baby Bot, stop! Most importantly, no hugging the sun. Okay? Okay, no hugging. No hugging. But you know who you can hug? All of your friends! All of them? Yes, all of them. All of them? All of them. Yay! Friends! [laughter] [music] Hats! Spring hats! Spring hats for everyone! [crickets] Billy! Hats, spring hats. Spring hats! Billy, I have exactly what you need! A spring hat. [laughs] This is the perfect size for you. Hats, spring hats! Lisa, you need a spring hat! That looks great. Hey! Spring hats! Spring hats! A perfect fit. You are welcome. What hat? I don't see any hat. Hello? Anyone there? [whistling] Hey, these hats Cowy gave us are ridiculous. I can't see anything! What hat? I don't see any hat. Waaah! You don't like my spring hats. Why not? They're beautiful. [music] Oh, Cowy, don't be sad. I'm sure they do like your hats. Really? Well... Yes? Yes, you just have to put them in order by size. In order? Do you know how to do that? My processor can calculate 12 thousand trillion data points per second. Yes, I think I can correctly order hats by size. Elliot needs a big-sized hat, Lisa needs a medium-sized, and Billy needs a small-sized hat. But Elliot is wearing a small hat, so he should wear... the big hat! Lisa's head is medium-sized so she should wear... A medium-sized hat! And Billy's head is the smallest so he needs... The small hat. Hey, look, I have a hat! It fits perfectly! I knew it. I make the best spring hats. But why do you call them spring hats? Because they're spring hats! Oh, they were pretty before but now they're beautiful. These are the best hats in the world! Wonderful. Oh, joy. [music] I know nothing! [music] Oh, beautiful. [background noise] No! What's the matter, Baby Bot? The leaves are falling! The tree is dying! Baby Bot, it's not dying. The leaves will come back in spring. Spring? Not that kind of spring, Baby Bot. [laughs] I'm talking about the seasons of the year. Seasons? Hang on. You don't know about the seasons? I know nothing! [drum rimshot] This is a job for Reporter Cowy. Breaking news, it is fall. What can you tell us about this, Baby Bot? I know nothing! We'll fix that! Connecting with our special fall reporter, Lisa! Hi, Cowy. As you can see, in fall, it starts to get cold and leaves fall off the trees. It can be rainy, and it is also really windy. That's all from fall, Cowy. Back to you. I know fall! We have an update. It's now winter. Baby Bot, what can you tell us about winter? Nothing! Here is Elliot, reporting live from winter. Hello from the cold winter, where the days are shorter, and it's so cold that sometimes it snows, and the trees still have no leaves. Goodbye from winter. The best and only time to play with snow. I know winter! Ladies and gentlemen and Baby Bot: Spring is here! Lisa, what can you tell us about spring? Hey there, Cowy. Here's the scoop: We are going to see the first flowers of spring come to bloom, but watch out because it is also allergy season. We recommend this season to enjoy the colors and aromas of the flowers. Baby Bot, look at all the leaves on the trees! [birds chirping] Wow! The leaves are back! [music] I know spring! I know spring! I know spring! Oh, Cowy? Lisa? Baby Bot, what are you still doing there? It's summertime! It's hot, the days are longer, and we're on vacation. Wow! That's all from sunny summer. Goodbye. I know summer! [music] I know nothing! [music] [giggles] [music] [giggles] Oops. Baby Bot, did you drink my water? No. Not me. It was here and now it's not. And you're the only one here. You drank my water! No. Yes! No! Yes! No! Yes! No! Enough! What on earth is going on here? Baby Bot just drank all the water from my pool. No! Yes! No. Yes. No. Hey, hey. Calm down already! Why don't we all go together to the big pool? [music] Oops. Oh, right. You're too small. But don't worry, your water's right there. Huh? That's not my water. That's a cloud. Exactly. The water evaporated and turned into a pretty little cloud. Cloud? Water never stops. It's part of the water cycle, of course. [beeps] You don't know about the water cycle? I know nothing! I do, but I just forgot. No you don't! Yes, I do! No! Yes! No! Yes! No! Enough! I'll teach you, but no arguing. [beeps] Water never stops. The sun heats it up and turns it into water vapor. Up high in the sky, it cools down and becomes a cloud. And what does wind do to a cloud? Water never stops. Water drops in the cloud get bigger, then it rains. Water never stops, and it repeats again and again because... Water never stops. I guess you get it now. I know the water cycle. Now that you know what's happening, let's fill the pool. I don't want that water. What? I want my water. Oh. Oh, no. My water's running away. Okay, Baby Bot, follow that cloud. [music] Don't lose it Baby Bot! [music] [thunder crash] [giggling] But this isn't water. It's snow. It's too cold. We need heat to melt the snow, then it'll become water again. Baby Bot, we need to go where it's warm. Down the hill! [music] [giggling] Wheeeee! Yay! [splash] [giggling] Come swim with us, Lisa. Me? In a baby pool? I'm a month older than you.! I'm going to the cool pool. The grown-up pool! [giggling] [music] To use the adult pool, you have to be this tall. [giggling] Hi guys. Is there room for one more? Of course. [giggles] Yay!
