NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: [APPLAUSE] Thank you I've lost count-- annual Isaac Asimov Panel I'm Neil deGrasse Tyson, your personal astrophysicist. And I also, after that, I serve as the Frederick And this is our annual event. This was started in the year 2000, with interest the late Isaac Asimov. Something I didn't know until I was told most of them were researched at our research [APPLAUSE] And so the legacy-- it's quite And we wanted to make sure we had a living And that is this event. Are we all aware of the topic this evening? I met some people outside, they said, "Oh, And I said, "That's love." Because you're coming without even knowing It is "The James Webb's Space Telescope's There's observations made in the early universe our prior understandings of how the universe. should have worked back then. And we figured that was the right time and panel. I will be introducing the panel. You will get to hear their voices initially, Then we'll get into our conversation. This event, you should think of it as, you having in the breakout lounge of a scientific Okay? That's how you should think about what we're And I'm a little bit of an interlocutor. So if there's something that I think you But mostly, it's scientists being scientists And this is what we all look forward to. So thank you. [APPLAUSE] Let me bring out the panel, and we'll learn First, a very longtime friend and colleague. We came up through the system of astrophysics Wendy Freedman, from the University of Chicago. Wendy, come on out. [APPLAUSE] From the University of Texas at I think I pronounced-- Kolchin. Yes, Michael. [APPLAUSE] And next, right from the CCA, right institution in a minute-- is Rachel Somerville. Rachel, come on out, neighbor. [APPLAUSE] And from Georgia Tech, Georgia John, come on out. And fifth on our panel is from Yale University Priya Natarajan. Priya, come on out. [APPLAUSE] Everyone here is an expert in some and observations of the early universe, especially And we're going to find out why that matters So Priya, tell us, what is your professional NATARAJAN: So, my expertise and interest is So, the dark components that we have to infer holes. TYSON: So when you say invisible, you don't you don't mean that the human eye doesn't NATARAJAN: No, I mean more than that. TYSON: Yeah. NATARAJAN: There is no light in any wavelength And so you infer their presence indirectly. And it turns out that they play a very important, TYSON: Maybe more of a role than the stuff NATARAJAN: Absolutely. And I-- TYSON: That's kind of spooky, you know. NATARAJAN: Yeah. TYSON: You say you're an expert on stuff NATARAJAN: Right. TYSON: That's more important than the things NATARAJAN: Yeah. TYSON: Okay. I just want you to remember how weird. that is. NATARAJAN: Well, the hidden is always more eyes. TYSON: That's poetic. The hidden is always more important than what's Thank you for that. So John, up from Georgia Tech. WISE: That's right. TYSON: Peach country. WISE: Yeah, the Peach State. TYSON: The Peach State. So, your expertise lands where? WISE: I do computer simulations on some of the first stars and galaxies in the universe, scratch. TYSON: Okay. Because you can't observe that. You have to simulate it. WISE: That's right, yeah. Not even James Webb's space telescope can TYSON: Okay. So we have to trust that you're putting WISE: That's right, yes. TYSON: Okay. We'll get back to that. WISE: Okay. [LAUGHTER] TYSON: Rachel. You're from the CCA, right on-- SOMERVILLE: Correct. TYSON: Downtown. So just-- that's a new institution. Just give us a minute on what that institution SOMERVILLE: So, the CCA stands for the Center one of five centers that are part of the Flatiron And the Flatiron Institute is supported by Jim and Marilyn Simons. And each of those centers works on a different TYSON: So I think biology is one of them as SOMERVILLE: Biology, neuroscience, math, quantum TYSON: Astrophysics. [LAUGHTER] SOMERVILLE: And astrophysics. There we go. TYSON: Okay. And so your specialty is? SOMERVILLE: So, I like to say that I make And I also make some supermassive black holes And I was also part of one of the teams that James Webb took. TYSON: Okay. So you helped to guide the-- you have some SOMERVILLE: We had some say into where Webb TYSON: Interesting. Okay. We'll get back to that. SOMERVILLE: All right. TYSON: Definitely. Michael, up from Texas. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Yes, sir. TYSON: How you doing? So what do you-- where do you come-- what's BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Well, I also work on dark I'm a theorist. I use computational-- big computation simulations. I also do pencil and paperwork, as much as And my interest is in the sort of descendants So, I look around us at maybe their fossil TYSON: Wait, he just said he made galaxies. He didn't say he made the first galaxies. Or is that the same thing? BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Well, John, I think, studies-- WISE: I make the first galaxies. TYSON: Okay. [LAUGHTER] All right. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: The first galaxies, yeah. Some of the earliest galaxies to form, so forming with JWST, even. But we can see them around us today, the fossil And so we can study them very well around So I study those galaxies to tell us about earliest phases. TYSON: Okay. And Wendy, we go way back, Wendy. Wow. FREEDMAN: Don't tell. [LAUGHTER] TYSON: No-- no, it's an important piece Telescope when it was launched, and you had do first. Where we pointed it first, and why. Because at the time, our understanding of was uncertain by a factor of two. That's-- that should have been more embarrassing [LAUGHTER] But you were going to do something So tell me, just give me a back story there. What happened with Hubble, and your role in FREEDMAN: So, back story, that's right. We didn't know the age of the universe better Was the universe 10 billion years old, or And there were heated debates. TYSON: But were you yet confident that it FREEDMAN: It would have been unlikely that possibility, given our ignorance at the time. And so one of the primary reasons that the was to resolve this problem. Solve the debate. And the-- TYSON: So the motivation for Hubble. FREEDMAN: The motivation for building Hubble. And in fact, the size of the primary mirror we used to measure distances, called cepheids, Cluster. TYSON: Wait, wait. I saw the size of the mirror was set by the FREEDMAN: That was another factor. [LAUGHTER] But-- TYSON: No, if they weren't-- FREEDMAN: No, no, no. TYSON: If we made it an inch bigger, it wouldn't FREEDMAN: True. But if-- you could have made it smaller, And the reason it wasn't made smaller was TYSON: Got it. FREEDMAN: So the director at the time of the a panel of people that said, what are the Resolving this problem was number one. And he made what he called "Key Projects." Big telescopes, he said. Big projects. If Hubble were to fall in the ocean and it what the answer was. So, what were those projects? And measuring this Hubble Constant, the expansion TYSON: I hadn't thought about it that way. So the key projects were-- if something unforeseen first things-- we would have the first and FREEDMAN: Yeah. And he was afraid that if he put together committee would slice it into small pieces And so some problems required more time. And so he designated those as key projects, TYSON: And you got a key project. FREEDMAN: I got a key project. TYSON: You got a key project. So you are-- you are on the main paper that And so where did the age of the universe show FREEDMAN: 13.7 billion years. TYSON: You-- it sounds like you nailed it. FREEDMAN: We nailed it. And it's held for, you know, the 20 years final paper. That's the value-- using that method that TYSON: Michael, do you agree with that age BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Well, I think that there's and that's with the cosmic microwave background-- And studying its properties statistically TYSON: Wait, so how did you get the age of background? What did you do?. FREEDMAN: So, we're measuring galaxies nearby, and what velocities they're moving at. TYSON: At the expansion of the universe. WEINDY: And that's expansion of the universe, using a cosmological model, and determine TYSON: In fact, that's what Edwin Hubble Did that have something to do with why they FREEDMAN: It did indeed. It wasn't an accident. [LAUGHTER] TYSON: It wasn't an accident. Okay. Okay. All right. So now, you're going to not look at galaxies. You've got a back door to the age of the BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: That's right. We're looking, actually, the other edge The very first light in the universe. And that tells us properties of the universe And that, combined with the cosmological model, And that age is 13.8 billion years, with an it. TYSON: So you want us to care that her answer But that difference matters to the two of BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Well, I think that difference-- TYSON: I grew up-- I came up with, it was BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Well, what's 100 million But. [LAUGHTER] You know. But I think there's a bigger issue that, that Wendy has really worked on and been an numbers that the different groups get sometimes. And there can be a number that would give More like 12.8 billion years. And so a billion is starting to get to be TYSON: So there's tension in the early universe. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: There may be. [LAUGHTER] FREEDMAN: Agreed. TYSON: Rachel, do you have any reflections Or you're cool with whatever they tell you? SOMERVILLE: I'm pretty much cool with whatever [LAUGHTER] Galaxies don't-- don't care TYSON: Yeah. SOMERVILLE: As long as the stars are younger TYSON: Oh! SOMERVILLE: Yeah. We have a problem if that's not the-- yeah. That was a problem back when I was-- yeah. So it's cool. TYSON: Yeah. So you're telling me there was-- I think There was a time when someone discovered stars you all were telling us. And this was, like, big headlines. SOMERVILLE: That was just-- TYSON: That's embarrassing. SOMERVILLE: Yeah. TYSON: So how was that resolved? FREEDMAN: That was resolved by discovering better measurements with Hubble. Those two things. TYSON: Oh. This is not about the accelerating-- it might We might learn more about this from Priya So this age-- so where should we take the Just tell me, who do we believe? No, let me not cause a fight. Let me just say, these are two methods that Yet they give two different answers that do So something has to give. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Right. TYSON: Who's going to yield here? FREEDMAN: Well, I think the interesting part possibilities, right? There might be something wrong with the data Or, it could be that there's something missing the dark energy and dark model we've been physical something that we have not yet discovered. And this might point to that. And so the question is, can we find something Or, this more exciting possibility-- I think that we could learn something fundamental values. Because there's only-- you know, we live And these numbers are not matching. They should match. We're coming from high red shift, coming And it's like, we're, you know, digging and we missed. [LAUGHTER] So, is it important, or not? And that's what we're trying to-- TYSON: So, Michael. You sounded more confident about your answer BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Well, you know, as a good hopefully. [LAUGHTER] And whichever the answer-- TYSON: That's a good theorist, arguing any BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Yes, that's right. TYSON: Not a bad theorist. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Well, I think that one angle is becoming interesting again, is this question Since there is this discrepancy, we can go JWST, other observatories. Can we do better in age-dating stars and star Because if we can say, "The oldest star younger age of the universe," then we're answer. TYSON: Got it. So Rachel, in the early universe, what is sent everyone into a tizzy? SOMERVILLE: So, I think there are two things One is that Webb found a lot of very luminous out huge amounts of ultraviolet light. And the theories that had been published before number of such bright galaxies. So that caused a big fuss. And then a little bit later, we started to that were also much larger, much more massive, predicted. So-- and maybe those two things go together. Right? But, so the problem is sort of too many, too How did we make these things so big? TYSON: So we under-predicted how-- the energetics Is that a fair characterization? SOMERVILLE: I like that way of characterizing So one of the first analysis, which was done we thought these objects were. And the masses are actually quite uncertain. TYSON: Masses of the black holes, or of the SOMERVILLE: So now I'm talking about the So the mass of stars in the galaxy is not We observe the light. And specifically, we observe the ultraviolet Because the light is red-shifted as it travels So-- TYSON: Wait, just to clarify that. The James Webb Space Telescope is exquisitely SOMERVILLE: Ah. TYSON: And you're speaking glibly about universe. SOMERVILLE: Yes. That's a great point, Neil. Yes............ TYSON: So what's going on here? SOMERVILLE: So what's going on is that as And as light travels to us for the 13.6 billion TYSON: 13.6? I-- SOMERVILLE: From-- [LAUGHTER]. No, no, no. Remember-- FREEDMAN: It took some time. TYSON: Oh, just the galaxy-- that's the SOMERVILLE: This is the galaxy. TYSON: Just the galaxy, thank you. SOMERVILLE: So it took a couple hundred million TYSON: Couple hundred million years. SOMERVILLE: Right? And then that light, as it travels to us, That's why it's called a red shift, right? So the wavelength gets longer, so it's emitted But by the time it gets to the Webb, it's TYSON: So we knew this in advance. SOMERVILLE: We knew this in advance. This is fundamental physics. TYSON: So the James Webb Space Telescope-- SOMERVILLE: It's almost like they planned TYSON: -- was conceived to be exquisitely that they emit copious ultraviolet light. SOMERVILLE: And in fact, this is one reason certain red shift. So there was sort of a red shift limit, if push beyond, partly because it's smaller. Its mirror is smaller, so it can't collect faint objects. But also because it couldn't see far enough us to do. TYSON: John, tell me about black holes in Why are they important at all? WISE: Yeah. So, today, we see black holes, mass, supermassive But-- TYSON: All galaxies we've looked at. WISE: Yeah. Most massive galaxies we've looked at. But in the early universe, that's not always And it's a big question of which galaxies don't. And what kind-- where did these supermassive And we call these the seeds of the supermassive So, you know, it's a big question, whether Because when you look with JWST, back then, as big as the stars that-- in the galaxy But nowadays, it's one part in 1000. So it's-- they're so much more massive. TYSON: Today. WISE: Today. But fractionally, compared to the galaxies to their stars. TYSON: Oh, I get it. I get it. So Priya, I think what he's saying here NATARAJAN: Yeah. TYSON: So you can get a black hole not as fraction of the mass that would be collected NATARAJAN: That's right. TYSON: So is it fair to say the black holes NATARAJAN: I think that's the big open question, I think the question, though, is that we know But occasionally, you could start out with around it and the host-- we believe that There are not sort of naked black holes floating TYSON: Oh. Okay. So the galaxy comes first. NATARAJAN: I think it remains to be seen. There-- TYSON: You just said! [LAUGHTER] NATARAJAN: Well, there is a class of black the very early universe, the infant universe, And those would supersede the formation of So-- but we don't know if they exist yet. SOMERVILLE: But we don't think that those NATARAJAN: No, but they could exist, though. Right? SOMERVILLE: Yeah. NATARAJAN: They may not be the seeds of the of all galaxies nearby. But they could have been seeds of some very We don't-- that remains to be seen. The problem is that once you see a black hole, from. Because there is no information about what-- from, and how it formed. So the only way we understand where a black said, they're much more ubiquitous, so there the relationship between the mass of the black galaxy. TYSON: Because the galaxy is going to feed NATARAJAN: The gas-- yes. The gas from the galaxy is going to feed it. But stars form from the same gas. TYSON: Okay. NATARAJAN: So as John mentioned, in the very to form black holes-- and a bunch of us predicted years ago that there has to be more than one make some black holes that were really massive Massive seeds. And we happened to find evidence for that TYSON: All right. But John, how do you just create a supermassive Is that just a knob you turn in your software? And then say, "Oh, it matches, so I must [LAUGHTER] Wait, wait. How many knobs are in your software? WISE: I have many, many knobs, but it takes TYSON: I'm just saying, if one of them is the mass distribution, and everything is an it matches, what confidence should any of the actual universe? WISE: No, that's a great-- TYSON: And you're just not over-supplied WISE: Yeah. Because you-- TYSON: Because you're not publishing papers this. Here's my"--no. It's gonna match it, because that's why WISE: That's right. TYSON: But why should I have confidence at WISE: Yeah. I mean, I-- TYSON: You could do some of this, too. NATARAJAN: Yeah, I do. TYSON: Don't you do-- it's a question NATARAJAN: Yes. TYSON: Okay. What? Right here. WISE: No, I have to build my own confidence. TYSON: Okay, go. WISE: I have to build my own confidence in Because-- I mean, the universe. is a very complex place. And so are our simulations. So we do these test simulations, in which simulations. Say a single supernova, right? We have one injection of an energy. You have a star dying, and you see how it And we do many of these tests in which we Because once you put together all these processes, can't predict how they're going to interact. But with-- you gain confidence from these TYSON: So you've done it in pieces initially. WISE: Uh-huh. TYSON: Before you can gain confidence in the WISE: That's right. Yes. TYSON: Okay. And do you-- are your computers as powerful He said he used supercomputers. NATARAJAN: I use supercomputers occasionally But I also work on the storyline of the universe. So there are patches that you simulate one Then I use his simulations to tie them all every epoch in the universe, with what the TYSON: Okay. So she uses real data. [LAUGHTER] WISE: I compare against data. TYSON: You do? NATARAJAN: He does too, yeah. TYSON: He does too. Okay. All right. Rachel, remind me, what are the dark ages What is that? SOMERVILLE: Ah. So as Mike mentioned, the first light in the gas that was left over after the Big Bang. And after that--...... TYSON: Which we observed. We see. SOMERVILLE: Which we observe, as the cosmic And after that, there were no stars. There were no accreting black holes. There was nothing producing any light. So we call that the dark ages. And the dark ages ended when the first star was born and started to emit light. TYSON: About how much time was that delay? SOMERVILLE: We think that was between 100 We have not yet seen those first stars, we Even JWST is not powerful enough to see them. But our theory predicts it should be around TYSON: John, last I read, JWST found galaxies WISE: Well, I don't think there's any But they found very-- TYSON: Wait, so you're saying you're right, WISE: The James Webb Space Telescope doesn't But-- TYSON: Yeah. It'll survive this assault on its integrity. WISE: Yes. What I think they have found are certainly. galaxies earlier than we've ever seen them really fundamentally the dark ages, when-- formed. We haven't seen anything that far back. ......... cosmic microwave background but we have galaxies out the age of the universe, if you're in FREEDMAN: So you're talking about observations TYSON: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And we've got some-- FREEDMAN: Yes, in principle. TYSON: He-- he denies them. He's in denial, that's fine. Just the ones declared, the James Webb galaxies gets you data even farther back than you ever Does that help you tighten the age? FREEDMAN: Well, I think as Michael was saying age. It's a way of doing this in a very different But I think one of the things surfacing in a lot of things, particularly about stars, Right? So there-- what you see in the distant universe It's-- you don't have the opportunity TYSON: It's just too far away to resolve FREEDMAN: Too far away. These are, you know, smudges. They're not individual stars that you can And so stars might have a very different history star formation, different metal abundance, kinds of dust that are causing the reddening. A different distribution of stars as they TYSON: When you say metal abundance-- we're How much heavy metal has been made yet, if Wouldn't there be, like, zero heavy elements, FREEDMAN: Well, we're seeing heavy elements TYSON: Okay, let me ask it differently. Why are you seeing heavy elements early in to bust out some supernova and spread the FREEDMAN: Yeah. And I think that's the interesting question, I mean, one of the exciting things about JWST but it's really nice to actually look and But then you're looking, and you have to And there are a lot of more knobs, as you give you the same answer if you adjust them So there's additional challenge in interpreting TYSON: Right. A very big point which I forgot to mention, a result. So do you have a way to test what other adjustments WISE: So, we compare against observations. So before James Webb went up, right, we had And it was like-- you know, it was a big Are our galaxies actually realistic or not? And I guess looking back at it, I was always than other groups. And-- because we don't have the luxury the present day. Because a lot of other groups, they run simulations But we really specialize in the first billion And, like, once these observations of JWST much brighter than expected. And that kind of matched with our predictions, about myself. All that anxiety just weighting on us. TYSON: We-- we feel good about you too. That's fine, John. [LAUGHTER] Priya, I loved what you said where of time. NATARAJAN: Yeah. TYSON: And then compare that with the data I'm still trying to understand, how does how is that touched by anything JWST is finding? Because it's just finding these-- this How does-- why do black holes matter back Does it tell you that galaxies formed sooner What is the clue that you're getting? NATARAJAN: Well, it turns out that, you know, ten years ago, we believed that black holes because their masses were tiny compared to TYSON: The big-- if you fell in, that'd NATARAJAN: That's right. TYSON: But-- but-- so, I just read recently, black hole ever in a galaxy? NATARAJAN: That's right. TYSON: That checked in at-- who remembers NATARAJAN: It was like 10 billion solar masses, TYSON: Don't you love how astronomers-- We're just so casual with astronomically So 10 billion. And how big is the black hole in our galaxy? NATARAJAN: It's just 4 million times the TYSON: Oh, that's low. NATARAJAN: Yeah. It's still supermassive, because anything as supermassive. TYSON: It's still supermassive, but it's NATARAJAN: It's pretty garden variety, yeah. TYSON: Yeah. Black hole envy in the universe. NATARAJAN: [LAUGHTER] Right. TYSON: Yeah. So-- NATARAJAN: So, in the early-- TYSON: So you've got to deal with that. NATARAJAN: Right. TYSON: This is going to make a difference formation of galaxies. NATARAJAN: That's right. So very early on in the universe, because which both stars get made from cooling gas, of a competition for who gets the gas. Right? So, who goes-- grows more rapidly, whether So when we see data from the James Webb, we TYSON: Of both. NATARAJAN: Of both. But then we also have a spectrum. And so there are very specific spectral signatures. So as a function of wavelength, that's the And we know what the features are for a growing And so we are seeing these composites. So you know you have a black hole in place So-- however, the key, key thing to discover from the black hole. Because the gas gets heated in the vicinity. The dying gasps of the gas, before it falls and starts to get heated up, and it starts TYSON: It is glowing so hot-- NATARAJAN: Yeah. TYSON: It's giving off x-rays. NATARAJAN: Yeah. And so you should be able-- TYSON: It's like a million-- how many-- NATARAJAN: Ten million. TYSON: Ten million degrees. NATARAJAN: Ten million, 15 million. And so you should be able to see if the object So that's the big question here. Can you really reach the first black holes? You should be able to see it with the Chandra Telescope. TYSON: So James Webb-- so the x-rays back NATARAJAN: They will still be x-rays. Because these are hard x-rays. TYSON: All right. So these are so x-ray-y-- NATARAJAN: Yeah. TYSON: Can I use that word? NATARAJAN: That's right. Yeah, sure. TYSON: They're so x-ray-y that you can-- NATARAJAN: You see through. TYSON: The red shift represented from the-- NATARAJAN: Yeah. Yeah........ TYSON: That just means we don't have enough it sounds like. NATARAJAN: Well, there's hard and soft. So they've kind of-- you know, hard x-rays TYSON: Which has nothing to do with what they [LAUGHTER] Does it have something to do with NATARAJAN: Right. How energetic they are, right? How energetic. TYSON: Okay. So, I did not know that. So those are still within their zone. NATARAJAN: Yeah. TYSON: And look at the bias that we experience, like, many words to describe all the colors spectrum. And out here, it's just x-rays. That's-- NATARAJAN: Well, because, I mean, it's-- it's all attuned to our retina, right? TYSON: Yeah. NATARAJAN: We can tell the difference. TYSON: I guess I'm okay with that, but I NATARAJAN: So, I think one of the-- this that's harboring a black hole, seeing it that you have an actively-growing black hole. Because the complication is, if you don't how much of the light is coming from the stars, TYSON: Got it. Okay. So-- NATARAJAN: There's uncertainty there. TYSON: Let me restate what I think you just If you had x-rays, it's smoking gun for NATARAJAN: Absolutely. TYSON: But x-rays are not a prerequisite for NATARAJAN: Yeah. TYSON: You can have a black hole that-- where be giving you x-rays. So then you have to somehow tease that information the-- NATARAJAN: Yeah. Lines, the features that you see the spectrum. TYSON: Features in the spectrum. NATARAJAN: And the shape of the spectrum. TYSON: Okay. NATARAJAN: And that's sort of an inherent And the Chandra Space Telescope, given its Given its resolution, it can't quite reach is reaching right now. So you need some clever tricks to be able places in the universe, nature's telescopes...... TYSON: You're telling the public that you In the research. NATARAJAN: Absolutely. TYSON: Okay. NATARAJAN: And magic. [LAUGHTER] TYSON: Okay. But I'm still trying to get to the bottom Rachel, what-- I'm still trying to understand. If we have galaxies in the dark ages, let's there. So what has to give? Are the data-- is there something wrong with Because that's happened before. You know this. We've had-- what, who can remind us of microwave background that-- that was misinterpreted And then everybody saw, "Wow. There's a new weird feature in the cosmic Let me come up with a theory to explain it." And they came up with the theory to explain "Yeah, I'm a theorist, I got this." And it turns out the interpretation of the theorists. [LAUGHTER] BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: So, this was the BICEP result. TYSON: BICEP, that's an acronym. What was it-- BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: So, I actually do not remember TYSON: Okay. FREEDMAN: It had to do with B-modes, I assume. TYSON: Say that again? Say again? FREEDMAN: It had to do with B-modes. So, going after gravitational waves in the TYSON: Okay, B-mode. FREEDMAN: The signature in the microwave background. So what you have to really be careful of is of the microwave background. TYSON: Dust in our own backyard. In our own galaxy. FREEDMAN: It can be in our own Milky Way galaxy, And so correcting for that is vital. And-- TYSON: They didn't do that correctly. FREEDMAN: Somebody actually read off a slide This is the lesson. Don't do that. TYSON: Okay. So-- so-- so that makes me wonder, do our ages? JOHN [?]: Well, I think-- TYSON: That's a yes or a no question. JOHN [?]: Well, now, or earlier? No. So, my models wouldn't have predicted galaxies. And I don't think anybody's models really And so that's really what people-- TYSON: That's a surprise. JOHN [?]: So I think that's a surprise to So that's what Rachel was talking about, It's also what Wendy was talking about with Everything is happening faster than we thought And we need to figure out--....... TYSON: And metals are what our people call table of elements. JOHN [?]: That's right. We have a very simple chemistry here. Hydrogen, helium, metals. TYSON: Yeah. So this kind of freaks out chemists when they JOHN [?]: Yes. TYSON: And we haven't corrected that over JOHN [?]: Not at all. TYSON: [LAUGHTER] Okay. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: X, Y, and Z. TYSON: Yeah. Okay. So the metals-- I interrupted you. I'm sorry. JOHN [?]: Oh, no. I was just saying that it all paints a consistent happening faster than the models had previously And we need to understand, is that something galaxies are forming at early times? Or is it missing something in our picture times?. TYSON: So Rachel, what has to be adjusted? SOMERVILLE: Yeah. So I wanted to come back to the question you models are correct? Right? And because, as John said-- TYSON: Right. Because just because they match doesn't mean that result. SOMERVILLE: Exactly. TYSON: Because there could be ten other ways You agree with that. SOMERVILLE: Exactly. I agree with that. WISE: Yes. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Yeah, I agree. TYSON: Good. SOMERVILLE: I think we all agree with that, But the problem is that, especially these So you can't run them 1000 times to explore degeneracies that you're talking about are So what was traditional-- TYSON: So degeneracy is when two different So we say those inputs are degenerate to each SOMERVILLE: Correct. TYSON: That's an interesting word in our SOMERVILLE: Yes. Exactly. TYSON: Okay, go on. SOMERVILLE: Yes. TYSON: It has nothing to do with their moral SOMERVILLE: Thank you for clarifying. TYSON: Yeah, yeah. I just-- SOMERVILLE: We don't want to get in trouble TYSON: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Degenerate computer simulations. Yeah, okay. What are you calculating? Right. All right. Okay. SOMERVILLE: So what everyone-- what most where we had lots of observations. We think we know how star formation works. We think we know how, you know, when supernova of stars? We even know a little bit about how black TYSON: And we have multiple telescopes working SOMERVILLE: We have many telescopes, we have TYSON: It's nearby. It's resolved. Everything. SOMERVILLE: Exactly. So we turned all the knobs in our models to And then, at least what many groups did, what we now take those models where all our knobs we predict what James Webb should see?" And you were accusing us of never publishing Well, we did. We published a paper before Webb launched And we disagreed with the observations, right? So we learned something. We learned that the physics we put into our TYSON: You learned that you were wrong. SOMERVILLE: We learned that we were wrong. Which is fantastic, right? That's science. TYSON: Okay. So-- yeah, that's definitely science. So, but you're wrong in an interesting way. SOMERVILLE: In an interesting way. TYSON: Yes. So-- so, not to deliver your punchline. But that tells you that either James Webb you cannot backstrapolate to the early universe. from parameter of the galaxies that are nearby. SOMERVILLE: Or maybe you have to do it in Right? So, one of the things that we've realized common in the nearby universe. are not typical of the early universe at all. So it's maybe as though you tried to extrapolate the Sahara Desert, or something. Right? Of course you would get it wrong. So you need to look for environments in the universe. And what was different in the early universe? It was much denser. Right? So there might be various differences. It was much denser, there were fewer heavy TYSON: Well, just to be clear, it was denser volume. SOMERVILLE: Exactly. The universe has been expanding all this time. That means it was much denser in the past. TYSON: And in fact, redshift 11-- which I universe. expanded, over redshift 11 to today? NATARAJAN: By a factor of-- how do I put TYSON: Is it just linear? Is it just linear? I think it's just linear. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Yeah, just linear. NATARAJAN: Yeah, it's just linear. TYSON: So it's either ten times bigger, NATARAJAN: Well, yeah, 12 times. TYSON: Oh, plus one. NATARAJAN: Plus one, yes. TYSON: Plus one in the equation. I just remembered that. So-- so ten times. So it's ten times denser back then. SOMERVILLE: Exactly. TYSON: Got you. Okay. SOMERVILLE: Okay. NATARAJAN: Ten to three. Ten to the three times. Its density is over volume. TYSON: Oh, cubed. Oh, excuse me. SOMERVILLE: It's the cubed. NATARAJAN: Cubed. SOMERVILLE: So it's thousands of times denser. NATARAJAN: Yeah. TYSON: Got it. SOMERVILLE: Right? TYSON: Ten times ten times ten. SOMERVILLE: So actually, if you look at how which are rare today-- TYSON: But you can find them. SOMERVILLE: You can find them. Star formation is much more efficient. And if we put that into our models, then we TYSON: Oh. SOMERVILLE: And we predict that there should away, even at higher redshifts. TYSON: Ooh. So in hindsight, you could have actually predicted SOMERVILLE: That's the frustrating thing. TYSON: Yeah. [LAUGHTER] 'Cause-- I was once dining with Takes him a while to process your question okay. So I asked him a question about, why didn't out of his general theory of relativity. And so, like, it took about ten minutes, and "You can't think of everything." [LAUGHTER] It was like, "Wow. Okay. That's good." You can't-- and he would be thinking of you. You can't think of everything in that moment. So were you going to say something here? Because I'm going to match you with another Yeah. WISE: Yeah. There is a-- oh, like, you're talking to--... TYSON: No, you. Yeah, John. WISE: Okay. Yeah. So I think another difference in the early galaxy. There was no galaxy. So you have all this gas coming into a dark And it has nothing to compete with. So you get this huge burst of star formation, today, there's already all this star formation Supernova going on. But this was a pristine environment. TYSON: Just a quick question. Priya, the dark matter, he just said it's NATARAJAN: Yeah. TYSON: So is dark matter running the show NATARAJAN: Yeah. It's in the driving seat. Basically, this dark matter, which is about the universe, provides the entire scaffolding gets collected, black holes form. This was sort of the cradles where everything TYSON: But Priya, you don't know what dark NATARAJAN: Precisely. When I say don't know what it is, we know That's the crazy thing about both dark matter We don't know what they are, fundamentally. Like, for dark matter, we don't know what We've been looking for it for decades. TYSON: If it is a particle at all. NATARAJAN: At all. And similarly for dark energy, we don't But we know exactly how they manifest in the TYSON: So you get to put it in your models. NATARAJAN: Absolutely. Yeah. TYSON: Okay. Wendy, when you're calculating the age of does dark matter matter? FREEDMAN: Oh, yeah. I mean, this-- TYSON: In what way does it show up in your Or, and dark energy, even? FREEDMAN: Yeah. If you're going to study the expansion of it's reacting to the presence of dark matter And it folds into the age. If you're going to determine the age, you TYSON: So maybe your wrong age-- sorry. [LAUGHTER] Michael. Maybe your age is different because you're dark energy? FREEDMAN: So-- TYSON: Is that possible?. FREEDMAN: Okay. So step back. What we're measuring is the-- when we're the Hubble Constant at the current time, the So we don't need to know. We don't need to know that model. But when we're comparing with the observations observations, that-- TYSON: That's the whole other method coming FREEDMAN: The whole other method. It fits these tiny little differences in the it fits exquisitely well the standard model And so the current tension is between the what the expansion rate would be today-- the expansion rate would be today-- given of dark matter and dark energy, and what we So that's where it comes in, that possibly, about the standard model. Something fundamental is missing in our current That's why it could be very interesting. TYSON: Michael, this sounds pretty tight, BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: That's right. So I think that actually makes this really not much space to look. We really know what we need to do. TYSON: You really-- something's really BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: So, something is really wrong, cosmological, if we need to change something what it kind of has to look like. It has to be some kind of energy that is like the microwave background. TYSON: Wait, you're inventing some other BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Well, once you-- FREEDMAN: We've tried everything. We tried everything, and nothing worked. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Once you've got dark matter one, right? [LAUGHTER] No. It's-- but I think that's what-- TYSON: But wait. You're pulling this out of where? BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Well, but that's-- I think Like Priya was saying, we haven't detected We haven't detected dark energy. But we know so much about observations of that we can say, "This is how they have So what we're saying is, the only way out galaxies, is observation--. TYSON: Is get another thing that we don't BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: That's right. And we should be able to know if it's there NATARAJAN: That's generally-- TYSON: Wait. Priya, what is he saying/ NATARAJAN: I think he-- no, no. I think he's saying the absolutely right So basically, dark matter and dark energy So if the setting-- if there's something It ticks faster in the early universe, maybe, So if dark energy could be changing with time, that moves and runs differently. And therefore, all the action that happens pace. TYSON: He's saying there's a whole other of dark matter, dark energy, over time, possibly NATARAJAN: That's the first, simplest thing TYSON: But Michael is just pulling something BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: That's kind of you to put NATARAJAN: Yeah, right. That is ether. FREEDMAN: But the beauty of all this is that NATARAJAN: Yes. FREEDMAN: If this is correct, it will show And it may show up in the next generation There's a prediction. If there is this early dark energy, you're TYSON: Let me jump back a little bit of history Priya, you also studied history of science In the history of science, there have been that kind of had to be there, because first also-- what am I thinking of? I'm thinking of neutrinos, for example. They were predicted because something else NATARAJAN: There was a missing energy. TYSON: A missing-- NATARAJAN: Energy. TYSON: There was a missing thing. And they said, there's some mysterious particle we invented to explain what happened. And sure enough, it existed. NATARAJAN: Yeah. I think we have these wonderful laws, right? TYSON: Okay. So that means I've got to agree with Michael? NATARAJAN: Yeah. I think, you know, all possibilities are open, So the fact that we have conservation laws, the presence of this dark energy. TYSON: Of the neutrino. Yes. NATARAJAN: Right? And I think similarly, it's quite possible to show us the way. Right? So future date, better data, more accurate of what are these specific models? There's tons of models. TYSON: So the James Webb Space Telescope is You need another telescope. NATARAJAN: I want more. I want more. FREEDMAN: It's pretty good. It's pretty good. NATARAJAN: It's pretty good, but we want TYSON: This is a tough crowd, I'll tell So John, you say you used super duper computers. Sorry. Just supercomputers? NATARAJAN: Yeah. WISE: I wish I could call it super duper computers. TYSON: I mean, supercomputer has been a term got good. WISE: Yeah. TYSON: And at any given moment, there's Is there something you can imagine you would or 1000 times more powerful than what you And of course I'm thinking of quantum computing. It's still a little bit of a pipe dream, to you now, that you can't wait to get a super-duper WISE: So, I think our problem in cosmology length scales that are involved with galaxy Right? We have everything from the quantum scale, in which we have to model. TYSON: And it all matters at some level in WISE: That's right. So you have-- even if you want to study how still huge orders of magnitude difference And that's what takes a lot of time. If I had a computer that was 1000, million But I think it really takes person power to Like, we need algorithms and people to actually of computer cores. TYSON: Just get AI to do it. WISE: And yes, I'm very excited with AI. But not-- maybe to help the code a little But to actually use, say-- I know, this is But if AI and quantum computing could come simulate a lot. But-- TYSON: You just don't want it to achieve WISE: Yeah. I don't want Skynet. TYSON: So I'm intrigued by that. I'm going to repeat, if I understood what You have to model things on the atomic scale, scale. And to do that-- NATARAJAN: Simultaneously. TYSON: Simultaneously. Good. So the computer has to know what every atom WISE: In principle, yes. NATARAJAN: Yes. We black box it now. WISE: You know, we can't do that, so we have These are these knobs that we tune......... NATARAJAN: Yeah. TYSON: Okay. So you make approximations. You say, "I think this many atoms in this property." WISE: That's right. So what I think is to have AI turn the knobs to-- so these are called emulators. It emulates physics. And that's what we're basically doing. So we have some physical model. It has to be grounded in fundamental physics, But I think once we grapple with that and physical results, I think that will be a huge TYSON: Yeah. Because I remember at any given time that it to be faster than what it was delivering WISE: Yeah. TYSON: Every time I ever did it, I say, "All I'll make do with this." So I felt very greedy at the time. Especially since, you know, my iPhone has I used back when I was coming up. So we're just greedy. WISE: Yeah. And now, like-- you know, we have-- NATARAJAN: Eternally greedy. TYSON: Eternally greedy. Okay. NATARAJAN: I think so, yeah. WISE: And NSF, NASA, they have these huge how much computing they actually have, in TYSON: Okay. WISE: Yeah. So we can partner with them, maybe. TYSON: You see the smile on his face as he Beams of light. WISE: I'm an AI optimism. TYSON: Yeah. It is true, in our field, we love us some It's the rest of the country that's just NATARAJAN: Right. TYSON: When journalists found out that AI "AI is bad." WISE: Or make videos now. TYSON: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just wondering. So Michael, let's go back to your version dark energy." You're going to invent this new other thing BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Yeah. TYSON: To account for this. And you feel sure that would reconcile these BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Well-- TYSON: Will it bring your number to Wendy's, BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: So, that would bring the microwave So Wendy would have been right. Yeah. And-- but I think-- you know-- TYSON: I'm going with Wendy on this, just, BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Yeah. There you go. TYSON: She's got more data than you do. [LAUGHTER]la BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: And I think one reason that to do based on the James Webb observations structure formation. It can help replicate those observations that And so that's one reason people find that It was predicted to match up these measurements That was why it was proposed. But it turns out one side effect is that things is exactly what the observations were. And so that's-- you know, like you say, match one observation. But if you invent one thing and it matches to think maybe you're onto something. So it definitely doesn't have to be this. But it leads us to think more about it, I TYSON: And Priya would agree, there's plenty the history of science. NATARAJAN: Absolutely. And I think as Michael said, one thing we that are there on very small scales, within The way a matter is heaped in the centers the supermassive black hole is sitting, and There's some tensions with observations. Some have come and gone, and some have stayed. And that model would actually help out some So you could have one little tweak in the resolve and bring into harmony many more observations. TYSON: And that gives you huge confidence If it brings into harmony multiply disparate NATARAJAN: And makes an additional prediction Then I'd be a lot happier. TYSON: Because otherwise, you're making NATARAJAN: Less powerful from-- TYSON: Less powerful. NATARAJAN: Yeah. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Right. TYSON: As Rachel made a post-diction. Atone for this, Rachel. [LAUGHTER] SOMERVILLE: I think it's important to point they don't solve both tensions at once. NATARAJAN: Absolutely. SOMERVILLE: They go in the opposite direction.......... NATARAJAN: They go in the opposite direction. SOMERVILLE: And there are also examples from and go, right? Which is why we have to be very careful to or have we missed something in the observation? NATARAJAN: To just clarify that, as theorists, So there's a landscape of models. And, you know, they're-- TYSON: Like I said, ambulance-chasing theorists. Always have got some-- WISE: Looking right at me. I remember this very well. TYSON: I was right on your shoulder when I WISE: Yeah. SOMERVILLE: But this is, I think, a place NATARAJAN: Yes. SOMERVILLE: Because I think we're getting very interesting about whether this is real James Webb, and the higher sensitivity, particularly measurements in more than one way, is going NATARAJAN: Right. I think multiple, independent lines of evidence, SOMERVILLE: Right. Right. Yeah. TYSON: Let me begin to land this plane that So Wendy, you're deeply involved in a new A Magellan Telescope, one of the most powerful Can you just give me just a brief overview I've read a little bit about it, but I don't [LAUGHTER]a FREEDMAN: Well, we've established-- TYSON: Hubble wasn't enough for you, and FREEDMAN: Yeah. We've established that astronomers are greedy. We want more computing power, and we need And so when we're looking at faint objects where we need high resolution, then we need So there are three big telescopes that are Giant Magellan is one of those. TYSON: That's the one you're involved FREEDMAN: Yes. So I led that project. I was the founding leader from 2003 to 2015. And it will be built in the Andes Mountains TYSON: Fourteen thousand feet kind of-- FREEDMAN: No. No, about 8500 feet. TYSON: Oh. Okay. FREEDMAN: It's not one of the high-altitude And near-infrared. And it is made-- there are seven mirrors Each one is 8.4 meters in diameter. So there are six in a circle, one in the center, for a 25-meter telescope. So this is an international collaboration. ... when we think of the resolution of a telescope, But if it's one mirror, that's very hard So you're saying, "I'm just going to FREEDMAN: Little. Twenty-seven feet in diameter. Little, yeah. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: And each of these mirrors FREEDMAN: Yeah. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Each of them. WISE: Yeah. TYSON: Each is bigger than the entirety-- BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: The entire James Webb mirror. FREEDMAN: Yes. So, why do we need a bigger telescope? It will have four times the resolution of TYSON: Right. So by the pieces that you're assembling, and it simulates what would be a single mirror FREEDMAN: Right. Correct. TYSON: That's like the size of this-- FREEDMAN: It's, you know, this auditorium. Yeah. It's a big, big telescope. TYSON: This is huge. FREEDMAN: Yes. TYSON: What are you going to look at with [LAUGHTER] FREEDMAN: Well, we're going to learn more We've got better resolution and high sensitivity. This telescope will collect a lot of photons. It will tell us, again, about the expansion We'll be able to go out farther with this stars and so on. TYSON: So then what do you need James Webb FREEDMAN: James Webb-- so, there are different of telescopes. Its infrared sensitivity gets beyond the dust. So, dust makes things look fainter and farther TYSON: So, the-- Webb. FREEDMAN: Webb. TYSON: And yours? FREEDMAN: This is optical. TYSON: Optical. So it's just what-- it's red, orange, Got it. Got it. FREEDMAN: It's like Hubble. Right. Right.... TYSON: It's just a really badass regular FREEDMAN: Correct. TYSON: Okay. WISE: They should call it that, yeah. Might be a better name, yeah. SOMERVILLE: And you also have to deal with So you have to correct for the blurring of FREEDMAN: That's right, yeah. SOMERVILLE: But we think that we can do that. FREEDMAN: But we know how to do that now. TYSON: And it's named Magellan, because It's just a Southern hemisphere telescope? FREEDMAN: It is a Southern hemisphere telescope, That's right. So-- and, you know, exoplanets-- we're have high enough resolution and sensitivity of planets and look for biosignatures. Oxygen, methane. TYSON: That's a whole other thing we're FREEDMAN: Yeah. Whole other. TYSON: Biomarkers, yeah. FREEDMAN: So, lots more to do. We're not solving all of the problems tonight. You probably couldn't tell that. There's stuff left to do. TYSON: Exo-- and exoplanets. Never-ending, what it is. So Priya, what's your philosophical view shift? We've heard that term before in our understanding What, of these headlines-- "Oh. Astronomers have to go back to the drawing Is this not one of those cases, and that's NATARAJAN: Yeah. I think we don't have to re-think the Big But there are details about our models that And as Rachel pointed-- as all of us have TYSON: But that doesn't make good clickbait NATARAJAN: Right. But I mean, we-- TYSON: "There are some details of their NATARAJAN: No, no, but we are in the midst So I think it's a new kind of revolution overabundance-- no scarcity of data. So there's a lot of data. Actually, a deluge. Which really restricts the job of theorists. We can no longer sit on a fence and say, "Well, TYSON: The data is constraining you. NATARAJAN: Very tightly-- soon, it's going and hence, our theoretical understanding. TYSON: Well, that's a good thing. That's a good problem. NATARAJAN: Absolutely. Absolutely. Good problem to have. TYSON: It'll give John less latitude and it'll bring him in line. NATARAJAN: Yes. No, but then remember we always also have So we need a self-consistent unfolding of Dark matter-- TYSON: That can't be overstated here. Because you can fit something then. NATARAJAN: Exactly. TYSON: You can fit something now. And if the arc does not work, go home. NATARAJAN: Yeah. Absolutely. It's not good enough. TYSON: Okay. Rachel, why is it that-- I also saw, in headlines, previously thought. Who's saying that? What is that? Do you remember those headlines? Michael? FREEDMAN: The Big Bang was wrong too, remember. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Yeah. So there's-- there is somebody who wrote done is, he's changed-- TYSON: When you say "paper" you mean a BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Two peer-reviewed research And they argue that we really do need a fundamental Not the Big Bang itself, but in our understanding So he does away with dark energy, he does But he says that light behaves differently And the fundamental constants of nature that So now they're the fundamental variables They change with time. TYSON: Okay. So he's doing what you're doing, John? He's saying, "Let's turn the fundamental NATARAJAN: Yes. TYSON: And let's turn the-- WISE: That brings fear into my heart. [LAUGHTER] TYSON: Yeah. Let's turn those into knobs and adjust those BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: That's right. And so that, he is claiming based on these that that model fits the data better. But I think that there are a lot of-- there's This model would not fit that as well. And one of the things that we see around us-- is 26.7 billion years old, as you've said. TYSON: So that's these headlines that must BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: That's right. But we can measure the ages of the oldest And we've been doing-- this is how-- TYSON: It's definitely not 27 billion. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: They're not 27 billion years They're very consistent with this 13, 14 TYSON: Is this a physicist who knew no astronomy, Why did it get published? BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Well, you know, I think it's The clickbait headlines, maybe less good. But I think that our models are best when And so they can take it. Right? If the model's right, it doesn't-- somebody in their model and the current model will If the current model is wrong, then we'll TYSON: Wouldn't the-- wouldn't the peer is 27 billion years old, we would have found FREEDMAN: Give or take. TYSON: And there's nothing in the universe So the universe spent half its life making BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Well, I think that certainly And you could say that any peer reviewer could But the domain expertise-- you need to know And its just not possible for some people TYSON: You can't know everything. NATARAJAN: But also, we are open to speculation, Right? I mean, our understanding is provisional, So we are open to speculation. So if it resolves a problem-- TYSON: I'm all with you on that. But aren't there people, cottage industries, time? NATARAJAN: Yeah. Yes. TYSON: There's a whole industry of people BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: As a peer reviewer, then you'd case?" And we would ask the authors to put it in the case." NATARAJAN: Yeah. The caveats. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: The caveats. TYSON: Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, I just--. I follow what people do with the physical And it's remarkable that-- let's go back, But after Newton's laws of gravity were around Earth, and Earth going around the sun, around Jupiter. That was-- no one saw that coming, unless Then, maybe it only works in our own solar Must it work around other stars? So when the first binary star system was discovered, And so we've been systematically testing so we're not just hoping that it persists We have good evidence for this. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Well, and not only that, it "Us" is not me. It was a long time ago. But, you know. TYSON: [LAUGHTER] Oh, you weren't there? BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Yeah, yeah. Almost that old. In the 1800s, you know, Neptune, or Uranus, that people couldn't explain from Newton's TYSON: Oh, that's right. Exactly right. Because when Uranus wasn't following Newton's laws in the universe, the distance beyond That's like your people changing the laws gravity you have not factored into computing BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Exactly. Exactly. WENDY [?]: Well, and to go further, you're I mean, the orbit of Mercury didn't fit.. NATARAJAN: Exactly. FREEDMAN: And the question was, is there another NATARAJAN: Right. And they thought it was Vulcan, right? FREEDMAN: Right. And it turns out--. TYSON: Yeah, invented Vulcan. They pulled that out of their ether. NATARAJAN: But then you needed-- FREEDMAN: It was a reasonable hypothesis, And then it was--. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: And that was a problem with FREEDMAN: Right. And it was one of the things that-- TYSON: And that was new physics. NATARAJAN: Exactly. You needed a fundamental rethinking of gravity And that's where Einstein's theory of TYSON: So, has this other paper caught on BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: With the press, yes. [LAUGHTER] With scientists, I think-- RACHEL [?]: But I'd never heard about it. So that tells you something. WISE: I haven't heard about it either. WENDY [?]: Yeah, I've seen it.. TYSON: Okay. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: I get a lot of e-mails saying, TYSON: All right. Let's now land this plane. If I could just get some final reflections You mentioned the Chandra Space Telescope. This is one of the-- NATARAJAN: Flagship missions of NASA. TYSON: -- flagship missions of NASA, as was NATARAJAN: Yeah. TYSON: And there's the Spitzer Telescope. Each one has a specialty. We just learned days ago that the Chandra NATARAJAN: Within two years. TYSON: -- within two years. And they will have no access to the x-ray NATARAJAN: We will lose our x-ray eyes into And the telescope is working. I think it should be funded for a little bit The idea was to phase it out as it starts .. NATARAJAN: Yeah. TYSON: But we're not bringing anything else NATARAJAN: Well, there are plans. There's been a call, and there have been x-ray telescopes. And the Europeans are putting up an x-ray TYSON: Athena? NATARAJAN: Athena. And-- TYSON: Well, I wish you well there. I mean, that's a tough time. I mean, the telescope is 25 years old. That's-- but if it's still working and the game. NATARAJAN: Yeah. And more importantly, I think we need something the x-ray universe. Because one thing that we haven't yet discovered, before I die-- well, I hope I don't die The gravitational wave detection from the We've detected the collision of two stellar-mass ground that made this discovery. The supermassive black holes also collide. And that will happen in the 2030s. We definitely need some instrument to be looking 'til then, because the supermassive black of burst of gravitational waste comes out, happens beforehand. TYSON: You can predict that. NATARAJAN: Yeah. TYSON: So these two colliding supermassive galaxies colliding, and they each have their And they'll probably find each other. NATARAJAN: Yeah. TYSON: Given the dynamics of this. Okay. NATARAJAN: And in that process, there'll All the gas and the stuff would be mixed up, TYSON: "Crud", is that an official word? Okay. [LAUGHTER] John, you were beaming when you and supercomputers. You were like a little kid, right, in your How soon do you think that will be with us?.. WISE: So, AI, we're in the midst of that TYSON: Definitely. But the computing power? WISE: The computing power? I mean, I think we're still-- the hardware But it really takes people to develop those the simulation code, to fully use the computers TYSON: So we need more coders out there. WISE: Yes, yeah. TYSON: To come up in the ranks. WISE: And most students, they are good coders. But to actually use these supercomputers at Of how to distribute that work among a million I mean, a computer-- imagine if you had a How do you split up the work and make them and just march forward? TYSON: A billionth of a second. WISE: Yes. TYSON: Yes. WISE: A billionth of a second. TYSON: Why not a picosecond? Why not an attosecond? Why limit yourself? [LAUGHTER] That's like, I'm old enough of storage, that-- people lined up to look WISE: I think-- because chips, right? When you look at how quickly the frequency So you take an inverse of that, and that's Or, sorry, nanoseconds. So that's the amount of time it takes for So it's not going to take-- TYSON: Today. WISE: Today. But that requires a lot of power. And you have to dissipate the power. So it's not going to come, I don't think, But we can do many more synchronous operations. TYSON: Rachel, at the CCA, what are your next Are you done with James Webb, or is there going to direct it to do? SOMERVILLE: Oh, James Webb is absolutely not That's the exciting thing. So it turns out that originally, Webb was But the launch went so beautifully that we years, maybe even longer. Maybe even up to 20 years. TYSON: What would-- I thought it's passively is it the stability of its orbit? SOMERVILLE: It's keeping-- exactly. It's keeping the orbit stable. Otherwise, it will drift away, and we would with it. So we need to keep in that nice orbit close TYSON: Let's just-- I know it's a million drag it back where it should-- it's supposed SOMERVILLE: Right. So, there are so many things that we would TYSON: Because unlike Hubble, you can't service SOMERVILLE: Yep. Probably not. TYSON: I'm sorry. Unlike Hubble-- SOMERVILLE: Not right now. Humans. TYSON: No one's going a million miles from SOMERVILLE: Humans cannot service Webb. It's possible we might be able to send a TYSON: To drag it back where it's supposed SOMERVILLE: So, there are some people who TYSON: Okay. SOMERVILLE: But we want to look at much larger We've only looked at very small patches seeing could just be flukes. We want to go much deeper than we predict are even further away. TYSON: With the new models that take you there. SOMERVILLE: As the models predict. And we want to get many more spectra, which there are, are there hidden black holes? TYSON: You can say "metals". We've been through that. SOMERVILLE: Yes. TYSON: How many metals there are. [LAUGHTER] Yeah. SOMERVILLE: We speak the lingo. We should be able to see the signatures of So there's many, many exciting results ahead. TYSON: Beautiful. With that new understanding. Very cool. Well, keep at it. And you're full time there now. Formerly at Rutgers, New Jersey. SOMERVILLE: Right. TYSON: So welcome to Manhattan. SOMERVILLE: Thank you. TYSON: Flatiron Institute, because it's is right there at 23rd and Broadway. SOMERVILLE: Twenty-third and Broadway is the at 21st. TYSON: Well, it's the Flatiron District, SOMERVILLE: Correct. TYSON: Okay. Well, welcome to town for that. SOMERVILLE: Thank you. TYSON: So, Michael. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Yes, sir. TYSON: Why do you look at me like that? Like I'm-- like-- [LAUGHTER]. What kind of theory is left for you to do is in models and simulations and the data?. BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: I think it's a fair question. And there isn't as much, certainly, as there But I think there is always room for trying And when you're adding in extra components of physics tell you that the energy content controls the expansion rate. And so you can do this-- okay, maybe you need one processor. But you could just make a plot of this. And that's basically pencil and paper calculation How that affects the relationship. between the redshift that we see something end of the universe. TYSON: So you're not using software or hardware, BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: That's right. TYSON: Is wetware, I think. Is it still called that? BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: I think so, yeah. TYSON: All right, sounds good. Now, Wendy. So, you're going to have the biggest telescope FREEDMAN: I hope so. TYSON: And when does it come online? FREEDMAN: Well, that depends on funding. So it's totally funding-limited now. The project has been reviewed, all the technical The site has been leveled, the hard rock excavated. There are dormitories there for people to So-- TYSON: You're just waiting for money. FREEDMAN: We're waiting for money. TYSON: How much money do you need? FREEDMAN: A lot. TYSON: How much? [LAUGHTER] BOYLAN-KOLCHIN: Who's got a hat to pass TYSON: We'll take the collection plate here. [LAUGHTER] FREEDMAN: So the-- TYSON: Wouldn't that be-- if in science, You know? FREEDMAN: What? TYSON: Come hear a really cool project, and So, how-- FREEDMAN: Well, no, I mean, the community The astronomical community has benefitted That's been true since the time-- TYSON: Since the beginning. Oh, yeah. Yeah. FREEDMAN: Yeah... TYSON: The Keck Telescope is private money. FREEDMAN: That's right. And the Magellan telescopes were private money, TYSON: Because telescopes have very long life just buckets to collect light. And the detector at the business end is what that you name in a naming opportunity in one seven decades later. FREEDMAN: And a lot of the funding for the TYSON: So how much more do you need? You haven't answered my question. FREEDMAN: In the ballpark of several hundred It's a lot of money.. TYSON: Not if you're-- wait, how many-- That's lunch money for them. FREEDMAN: Can I enlist you? TYSON: So Priya, I want you to take us out, of science. Where are we today in this field, and is there-- 20 years, a completely new understanding of Or is this going to be tight, and maybe there's and we'll plug this into that broader, bigger NATARAJAN: Well, I like to think that this that is going to completely transform our However, we've never been able to predict I don't think Copernicus ever imagined, in the Voyagers leave the solar system. So I'm not going to speculate exactly. But I'm going to enjoy the thrill of the I mean, these revolutions are just remarkable. And to think that we, with this little gelatinous TYSON: Talk about your own head. [LAUGHTER]a NATARAJAN: Small head. You know, are able to figure out so much. I mean, it's astounding. I mean, I am in awe of the universe and the has worked, and reason. I just find it really unbelievable that there Right? TYSON: I didn't see it going there, but Wow. Wow. [APPLAUSE] Wow. Yeah. So it is interesting we can make these discoveries I saw my YouTube, and they don't me not NATARAJAN: [LAUGHTER] Right. Right. TYSON: "I'm not gonna get vaccines, because This goes on. We live in that world. NATARAJAN: We live in that crazy world. TYSON: But so do you-- I'm going to end You're talking about our gelatinous brain. Are we smart enough genetically, as a species, the universe? Or deeper still, are we smart enough to even NATARAJAN: Oh, I like that. That was a really beautiful second question. I think that we-- there is no reason-- TYSON: Or are we all just touching the elephant? NATARAJAN: Right. TYSON: And we'll never see the elephant, NATARAJAN: Right. I think that regardless of whether we as individuals is going to be interesting. It's going to augment our capacity to understand, and data, and process it in the ways that TYSON: So, I like that. So it's AI-augmented intelligence, rather sensible understanding of this. NATARAJAN: Yeah. Yeah. And I think that is the way of the future, something could explode, right? This is science. We don't know. Something could fundamentally shift. And maybe there'll be a way to cognitively I don't know. I mean, you know? That's possible, too. Right? TYSON: Hmmm. NATARAJAN: You don't sound-- TYSON: No, no. I-- you know. Okay. I just-- [LAUGHTER]. NATARAJAN: Loss for words? TYSON: Yeah, yeah. I don't-- yeah. I don't want anybody messing around inside That's all. NATARAJAN: Oh, I see. TYSON: So. Just one final-- oh, Wendy, you had a quick FREEDMAN: So, I love that we're in this good place to end. But can I inject a practical thing having TYSON: Please. FREEDMAN: And JWST data. So our group right now, in these questions program to try and measure the expansion rate And we've done something, we've blinded We've taken the data and we've added random those random numbers-- so that nobody in be. And we're doing all of the analysis in this are applied to the data so that we don't It hasn't been applied to this program before. But we are this close to having an answer. And so in three different ways-- so either, agree. Two might agree. I don't know which ones. But we will be able to do that very soon. And I'm really excited about this, because and it's going to be fun. TYSON: So, ways of testing the integrity of FREEDMAN: Yeah. TYSON: Yeah. Very, very cool. Well I like that, and I like the future, I said, and the angle with which you have approached I'm much more comfortable in this universe, on top of this situation. Join me in thanking our panel.
