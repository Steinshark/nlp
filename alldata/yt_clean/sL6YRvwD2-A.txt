and without DNS records and rules the internet as we know it would be impossible they allow our devices to communicate with servers and websites using human readable domain names instead of complex IP addresses making it easier for us to access the wealth of information and services available online so let's start off with DNS records DNS records are like the Playbook or the phone book of the internet the help computers find websites and other useful online stuff by translating the name into the secret code that computers use to talk to each other every DNS record holds specific data about our specific details about a website like it's a secret code where it sends emails and what other names it goes by and the secret codes that you know are the IP addresses and there are many different type of DNS records each with a specific purpose some common type of DNS records include a record Associates a domain name with IP address ipv4 address AAA records that we have here Associates a domain name with IPv6 address MX record specifies the mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain name CNN records Maps one domain name to another domain name and these four are really important very very important a records triple quadruple a records cname records NS records and MX records let's go back and let me actually explain you with another example so that you can understand why DNS records are so important so let's suppose you want to visit a website like flipkart.com you type the URL into your web browser and hit enter your computer sends a request to the DNS server to resolve the domain name www.flipkart.com into a IP address that's what we understood right now till now so here what happens is the DNS server actually looks for the relevant DNS records for www.flipcard.com if it finds an a record or flipkart.com that maps to the IP address 192.168.22.3 let's suppose it actually returns this IP address to your computer your computer then uses this IP address to connect to the web server hosting flipkart.com and the website is loaded into your browser in this scenario the DNS record or the a record that I set which Maps a domain name to a ipv4 address that is 192.168.22.0 played a critical role in translating the human readable domain name that is flipkart.com into the machine readable IP address without the DNS record your computer would not be able to locate the website you wanted to visit because there is no entry as I already told you it's like a phone book it needs records so that is why it is mentioned here that DNS record is a database record used to map URL to an IP address so DNS records are stored in DNS service and work to help users connect their websites to the outside world so there can be records which map ipv4 addresses like domain to ipv4 addresses and quadruple a that Maps IPv6 addresses from domain names and another example of the importance of DNS records is with the email delivery so when you send an email to someone at the domain name flipkart.com your email server needs to know which mail server to use to deliver the message and this information is provided by the MX record that is what I told you and that MX record is for the flipkart.com it could be smtp.record.com which specifies a mail server responsible for handling email for that domain that is why records or DNS records are really important because let's suppose you have a phone book and you don't have any numbers or names representing those numbers then what's the use so let's suppose you want to create a a record so a record actually points to an IP address for a website or domain name so you want to map the domain name example.com or flipkart.com or plytholic.com to the IP address some IP address for example 192.0 2.1 so you would create an a record in the DNS for example.com with the following information so the information will be you will provide name which will be flipkart.com or twitter.com the type will be a because that's the a record and the value of the IP address associated with that and similarly if you want to see what's the a record just you can type nslookup hyphen type equal to a space the website's name in the command line let's see the next one this is the quadruple error card so and for the play record in DNS is used to map a domain name to an IPv6 address so you would create a quarter play record in the DNS for example.com or flipkart.com with the following information so the name will be example.com type will be quarter delay value will be the IPv6 address and we have the next one that is the cname record that is very important as well that is a canonical name record that is used to Alias one domain name to another suppose you have a website with domain name www.wordpress.com and you want to create an alias for it like blog.wordpress.com so you would create a cname record in the DNS for for blog.wordpress.com and the information that you will provide is the name that is blog.wordpress.com or example.com the type will obviously be C name and the value will be www.wordpress.com or example.com or the one that you want and another one is basically your NS record so this is basically the dedicated domain name to a set of authoritative name servers so ns1.example.com is basically your authoritative name server so let's suppose you have a domain name example.com and you want to delegate the responsibility of managing the DNS to a set of authoritative name servers so you create a DNS for that like name is equal to example.com type will be NS and the value will be NS Dot example.com and the last one that we have here is MX so MX is basically a Mail Exchange record it is used to specify the mail servers that are responsible for accepting email addresses or email messages on behalf of the domain so what you do is you create a example.com or let's suppose in our thing like gmail.com so if the type is MX and priority is a parameter used in MX records to specify the order in which mail server should be used to handle emails for a domain now that we have discussed at length about DNS records there is something really important to discuss next that is yes DNS rules so DNS rules are like the laws that govern how the Internet domain name system actually works they tell us how domain names are organized how different servers communicate with each other and more so let's talk about DNS rules so as we already know that DNS rule is the set of configuration settings that determine how DNS queries are resolved for a particular domain or a set of domains so let's suppose you own a domain called pytholic.com and you want to create a routing rule that points the subdomain blog.pytholic.com to a specific IP address so the rule that you see here is basically name is blog.python.com type is a routing policy simple value is 192.0.2.1 so the name this is the domain name that you want to map to an IP address in this case it is pytholic.com type is basically this specifies the type of DNS record that you're creating in this case it is a a record which is used to map a domain name to an ipv4 address the routing policy this specifies how Route 53 should Route traffic to the specified resource in this case it is using a simple routing policy which simply Returns the IP address specified in the value field and the value the most important thing there's the IP address that you want to map to the domain name and in this case it is 192.0.2.1 these are examples don't take this in a little sense this IP address could be anything and on the other hand DNS record is a specific piece of configuration data that provides information about a particular domain or host so this contains the record information so a record will be blocked.pythonly.com and the next one we have is MX record cname record and txt Records these are multiple ways of defining a record and DNS records actually provide specific information about a domain or host while as DNS rules Define how that rule or how that information is managed and resolved so if I say create a record for pythonic.com but how that should be resolved is given by the DNS rules so let's suppose you create a blog.pythonic.com here and how it should be routed is basically having the name python.com type is equal to a routing is simple and value equal to this but you would be interested in knowing that DNS rules is not a commonly used term at all however there is a similar term DNS Zone file which is a collection of DNS records for a particular domain or subdomain and a DNS Zone file contains information about the domain name and its Associated IP addresses mail servers and other DNS records and DNS tool is not a standard term in Amazon Route 53 but routing rules can be created to control the routing of traffic to different resources based on specific criterias so I hope you got the point here don't get confused a rule is nothing but a set of configuration settings that determine how DNS queries are resolved for a particular domain so let's suppose I want to resolve it by having a simple routing policy so I'll add the simple routing policy as my routing policy Rule and the value will be the IP address that I want to point it to and the DNS record will be the important factor here because that will provide the specific information or the configuration about a particular domain or host now that we have discussed about the users and the DNS resolvers at length now let's move on to the service itself that is Route 53 and let's talk about
