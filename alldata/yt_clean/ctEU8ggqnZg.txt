Today we're doing science Let's talk about that. Good Mythical Morning. We're simple men. We love to do experiments, Yeah, classic guy stuff. Reading instructions is for dopes. Don't tell us what to do Blowing stuff up is for men. Yeah. It's time for Science Without Guidance. Featuring The Beaker Boys. Okay, beaker boys. Each round you have ten minutes to with the items in front of you. You've got twenty-five points total at least one in the end to win. You also have. One in the end of who? What? Either. You also have. I'll take it if I have to. These lifelines. If you need some help, you can grab a message from Science principle at play. For one point, I can reveal a decoy item for two points, I can vaguely tell you what result And if you can't figure out the thing that you're or you run out of time, This round contains two decoy items. Ready? Set, solve. All right. You got a jar. Jar. It's got a lid. We have a. Lid. A ping pong ball. We have what I believe Dyed red water. We have a fire making Lighter. A candle. Candle. We have Rose Rush from Paris Hilton. Is it. What? Is it? Flammable? Hopefully. It's just a. It's a fragrance, not a hairspray. Okay. Okay. You're gonna give yourself a headache. Is that what she smells like? A T-shirt? I wouldn't know. And a glass vat. Casserole dish. Whatever that's called. I personally believe that for ambiance. I personally. And it is not related to the experiment. That you just take. No. You ain't gonna start a fire. Don't put it over there. Just light the thing and let's you know? Come on. This is how I'm thinking. Let's. Let's hear from Mikayla because. We need something. Because we don't know if we're It's a steal. What's up, dweebs? Hey, hurry. Hurry? Yeah. We're being timed. Okay. I guess. I run on my own time. I'm a scientist. See, now it's taking longer. It's taking longer than if Takes a very, like, it could take years. I respect that. Take as much time as you need. Don't disrespect me. But what you're saying is so important that we need to hear it. Right, right, right. Okay. Don't you love it when So we know that we need the alcohol. Respect my time. Thank you, science. I bet you the ping pong ball can go wild. But it can't be as simple as lighting, what you wanted to do a moment ago, What if you? Sometimes you can spray something Yeah. And then drop a candle inside. We're really controlled in the way So get ready to put the lid on that. Stop. Stop. Well, are you ready? Go. I'm ready. All right, he's got. So now we've got alcohol in there. Yeah, we did it. Because this thing, We gotta decoy something. We gotta get rid of something. Decoy. You don't need the ping pong ball. I was thinking that went wild in there. So, now what goes wild? Could it change? Could putting the dye on the because we only have one more decoy item? Alcohol is going to make something happen with the shirt. Like a wild design, We gotta spend some more points, man. We need to find the desired outcome. Whatever Stevie said. Yeah, we gotta go for it. For three points? Yeah. This is too hard. The vague thing? Yes. Okay, fine. Can you show me some geysers? All right. Oh, sorry. Hi, sirs. Can you show me some geysers? Oh, thanks for clarifying. Geysers. Why would we need this? And why would we need? We know we need this. We need to set this on Light the candle, you can light the candle. And then what are you gonna do? Place it on top of that? No, we're gonna. We're gonna charge this thing up, and we're gonna see what happens. What if it explodes? It won't explode. Well, I do have. I just burnt my. Five minutes. Are you? Let it, let it, let it get going. Are you ready? Ready? Yep. Geysers. It went out. This is too hard. Don't complain. We're in the middle of it. I think we have to. It's just one more point for a decoy. Two. Two? Can it be one? Negotiating? Desperate. Yeah. Did you see that? See, there is alcohol in this. We got to put water in this thing, and then we gotta put alcohol in it. On top of it. We gotta set it on fire. That's what it is, Link. It's making fire water. You gotta put alcohol on top. Yep. Put alcohol on there. Keep going, keep going, keep going. Stop. Float it. Add a little bit more, Now I'm erasing what you did. I've thought about it, and I'll give you the decoy for one point. Okay. Do you wanna accept? Yes. Yeah. You don't need the T-shirt. We weren't using the T-shirt. Oh, here we go. I was looking at it. Now, now spray it, spray it, spray it lightly. Don't you love it when it goes wild? Geysers. Geysers. I put it out. Okay, I've thought about it, and I'll give you another hint. You're not putting. Don't listen to her. You're not putting. Don't. No, listen to me. You've lost our trust, Stevie. You're not putting the liquid Hi, sirs, would you like. And that's not the answer in totality. I'm just telling you. I know what we got to do. Make a, make a film on the top of this? What you're going to do is take all. Push all this out. Push it all out. Push it out. Put it in there. No, no. Take the liquid from the casserole Forget about it. But the pan is. The pan is never a thing. To get where, we're starting over. Ninety seconds remain. We're starting over. Trust me. I'm doing it, but I don't like it. Okay. All right. Get it out of there. Okay, now set it down. Put this. Spray this. A whole bunch of crap in there. Right, right, right. Okay. Now, stop. Put it over. Now pour water around it. Yes. You water? Less than a minute. Pour water on it. Now we somehow light the candle. Just. Just get to the. Just. How would you get to the candle? I would take this off. Okay. Would light the candle. Then I would spray it inside here. Stop. And then I would go. oh, geyser. I knew it, man. We were so close. I was so close. That was cool. That's crazy. What happened is crazy. Pressure. Let me guess, Yeah, and our usual, Caitlin was out this day, Let's take a look. Yep, yep. Take that. Pour that into the pan. Yeah. Take your time. Now, that that's full, now. Yep. Take a candle. Yes. Put that down. Yep, yep, yep. Good. Go ahead and light it. Yep. Go ahead and light it. We were so all over it, man. Now take the jar. There you go. Why are you so enthusiastic? Fill it up with alcohol. Put it over the top. That's so crazy. Science! So the alcohol vapors from the perfume creating rapid combustion in The gases created by this causing a sudden increase in pressure. And that's why there's a small explosion. That was cool. Thanks for the help, Stevie. We'll take it. We did it. Your lifelines are the but this time, Your time starts now. All right, we gotta get better this time. Magnets. Lots of magnets. Balloon, copper coil made into a springy spring. A flashlight that works, LED. LED. A lemon. This is real. A real lemon. And what they've labeled as salt water. I know that you can make a because of ions. Let's get the, so, Where we're going, But why would they give us. So they think that we Oh, they know that we would. And then we put this in there. Does that work? No. No. We need to know what the outcome is. Is that when she said geysers? Yeah. Well, I think it works. Hi, sir. It did work, geyser. It was catchy. Hi, sir. Sir. Hi, sir. It did make geysers. All right, but. Let's start there. We got three things we gotta remove. We'll make. It'll. It'll. All right. It'll make clear. Outcome. We need it. We're willing to spend the big bucks. There are all kinds of fields out there, but the one in this experiment Okay. All right. Magnetic fields make things spin. Magnetic fields can make batteries spin. And if you, Yes, Link. And it, does it float? No, no, no, it doesn't. It doesn't. What else could spin besides a battery? A balloon. So if you blow a balloon up and then? Float it. And then if I take If we made a balloon spin, Hopefully thousands of people. That's all you're hoping's watching? We gotta do better than that. Magnetic field. You know what? We don't need this, but we should probably You wanna? Because this is two items in one. If we get rid of this, we're real. Do we need the flashlight? You know you can't ask me that. Decoy. Okay, you're asking for a decoy? Yes. You do not need the lemon. No lemon field. So does the copper? Is not magnetic Link, did you want to ask me Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ask a friend question. Yeah, like. Like what? Yeah. What should I ask you, friend? Maybe the question that you tried Do you really think that it's worth I do. As a friend. As a friend? I do. Yep. And the only reason we would. Look. We don't need to be rescued. We don't need to be rescued. Well, maybe we do. The only reason we need Are you asking as a friend? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I would agree with that. All right, the battery is gonna go Go to the scrapyard, lemon. And you know what it's gonna do? It's gonna make a magnet spin. What we're gonna do is See, I'm gonna use the wet battery again. I'm gonna put it down there. And then what I'm gonna do Don't need this tray I'm gonna start putting magnets You see, I almost did it. He spun it. I saw it. I don't know if Carney was staving Do you know what, Link? Check this out. Check this out, Link. Oh, that scared me. Check this out. This fits perfectly around this battery. As if they. Doesn't it, friend? They intended this, friend. And what we don't need, at this point, is the balloon. Or the water. Oh, I hadn't even thought about that. I gotta know if the water is. Two decoys. All right, give us another decoy. You do not need the water. See? Okay. All right. And here we are putting That's dangerous, man. So there's two more. There you go. There's one more. You put that down. And then what? What's this? I think we can make this spin. I'm losing it. I'm losing it. Shoot, we're running out of time. Mikayla. Mikayla. Mikayla. Ninety seconds. Mikayla. Mikayla. Mikayla. Please help us. Take all the time you need. Okay. All right. You are currently, currently, on track to getting this. You are currently. We are? Currently. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a current. On track. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look. To getting it. And we're spinning it. Now. If you take that and you. Touch the ends on both sides. Oh, it's getting hot. Oh, it's getting hot. Disconnect it. The wire got hot. It got so hot. Because it's conducting, you're currently. You're gonna burn yourself. Stack it through all of these. All right, so we got that. Okay. And then. Oh, it's so hot. Use this. Disconnect it. I don't have. I don't. It's gonna burn. Why do I? Five seconds. You connected it. Use the gloves. Hold it up and spin the thing. And time. I bet. I bet Lucas couldn't do it either. Flashlight. Take the battery out. Boy, he's in the Mikayla school of pacing. All right. You made a machine. Easy. And you know what? Look. You can put that in your room. Put a little ballerina on it. Look at what we had. Look at what we did. We did the. A sideways version of that. Yeah, we did a cool version of it. I'm not gonna point fingers here, but. Hey. The copper thing was totally ready to spin on that battery. Yeah, but I did. I narrowed it down to the, I just couldn't. I mean, it got hot, though. We gotta redeem ourselves. It got so hot, I burnt my little fingers. You're a little bit scared of the dark, or you just like to see where around your bedroom at night? Well, you should get the GMM Neon Sign Night Light. Yes! You plug it right into the wall. Yes. And then it's just sensitive to Yes. And you can get it at Walmart while supplies last. Pretty cool. GMM Nightlight. Okay, you only have five points remaining. Okay, and we need to keep one? Don't rub it in. And you need to keep one. There's only two decoys this round. And your time starts now. Okay, we have a beaker. We have an apple. It fits in the beaker. We have a post it note, a pencil, And once again, we have fire. Pencil lead is not flammable. That's good to know. All right. What can we do with this? All right, we have five points. Knowing the three pointer Let's not waste any time. The principle. because last time she said Because I could see. And that's how we got to Really. Yep. And because I could send that. Yeah, he could do that. I could do that. We're done. He's done. I could put that there like a spit. But Stevie, Okay, it's three points out of your five? Yes, we do. That means, we basically. We are stuck at that point. No, no, no. We could also use Mikayla. You're one point? Okay. Yeah. Okay. Where there's smoke, there's the solution you're looking for. Okay. The solution. So, when we smoke something, it creates apple juice. We're going to use apple juice to write and then we're going to It's the old apple juice hidden message. So what I'm going to do is. How they communicated in the olden days. See, I'm dipping in the inkwell. Yes. You really don't even need a pencil. So, I'm doing. And then you just do it with this We don't need a pencil. But the pencil was a hint. The pencil was a distraction. But ironically, we don't need the pencil. Because we're just gonna use just a little bit of apple juice. Let me write something. Okay, all right. Okay, all right. Okay. Don't scratch it. Don't scratch now. It's going back over. You got it. Now hold that up. It's hard to see. All right, so I'm just gonna put that. All right. What? Is there anything written on that? I don't know. I gotta burn the ink without burning the. Yeah. It's working, though. It is working. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's on you. That's on you. Yes, yes. Okay. All right. We got plenty of time. No one's celebrating. I think. We haven't. No indication. Mikayla, no pun intended, because we need. It's the only thing we can afford. Yeah. You're almost burning bridges, too. Okay, okay. For respecting my time. You got all the time in the world, right? Yeah, yeah, we do. We do. We do now. We do. We thought we did, but we don't. Okay, you guys must be dense if you're not getting this. Density. One more time. You guys must be dense if you're not getting this. If you're not getting this? Dense. But there's no smoke. Five minutes. Where there's smoke, the solution is the Yeah, something like that. You guys must be dense. Density. There's no liquid. Can we write a hidden Density and smoke? First of all, the best way to make smoke. Is fire. Is underneath this. Remember how we captured smoke that time? Yeah, we made a lot. So, and burn it. But you gotta let it burn. The hidden message is revealed not by fire, but by smoke. There is no hidden message. We burned the wiener. The wiener was on this. We were right in terms. Thirty seconds. Okay. We were right in terms of the paper clip. The paper clip. It's sticking. To do something. Stick it to the. Oh, you've let the smoke go. I'm like, well, that's bartender. And you go like that. There's a hidden message in your drink. The dense smoke creates a. Maybe it's a little And when you light it, it burns away. Look, it burns. And then watch what happens. Watch, watch, watch. And then watch, watch, watch. Yeah, let's. Something like that. Let's. Let's take a look. I've learned something. What the secret message was all along. It was a secret message. Yes. Paperclip. We didn't use that at any point. What's he doing? He's creating a hook. Okay, we never would have gotten that. Oh, you could make a little. A cigarette. He's making a cigarette. You can't do that on YouTube. And, yeah, we never would have done that. He didn't even write a hidden message yet. Okay, so now he's burning it. You see the smoke going down? He's dookie-ing out smoke. Why is it doing that? Why is smoke going down? Because that's how cigarettes work. When they're at the same temperature, This may come as a surprise, since we usually see thus at a higher So, as the smoke travels it cools down, making it denser than the air and What? Man, that would have been awesome. Speaking of cool things if you had won, you could have been able to see what it looks and we'll let you look. But you can't enjoy it. Okay. But, and I will use it for slow science. There we go. Our DNA? That's our hair? Yeah. Don't ask me how I got it. And you braided it? You're matching. Bit strange. Thanks for subscribing That's weird.
