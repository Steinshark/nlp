What a beautiful old man. What a lovely head. India is filled with old men, memsahib. But not like the one in the yellow turban. He's like a head of John the Baptist. The memsahib refers to the storyteller? Are these silent monsters It is but a truce they keep with man. But I, who have seen their tusks I could tell you a tale of the silent ones. For a few coppers? Eh? Yea, for a bowl of rice? What would you do with my image, I would keep it... Verily, you would have Nay, you would have the book In the beginning, you must think a silence so vast that the ear can hear it. Great trees like the pillars of the temple... with ferns like green While above, under the dome of heaven the wind moves restlessly, These are the eaters of grass Early the little fawns feet that make no noise, ears that hear the leopard leaving his lair. For the leopard lives by the law He will kill for hunger and eat thereof... but he will never kill fork killing's sake ... a law all men break. These are the lords of the jungle. The tribe of Hathi, the silent ones. They go their way, eaters of grass For the wolves are the true And like huntsmen, with a strict regard Free Companions of the woods, they may until the strongest of them wins Yet jungle folk say... the wisest amongst them He is a teacher of the jungle law. Yet there is one who knows law__... the barrel-bodied mugger, with his chin in the shallows hoping to drag down to the depths And in the legends of the jungle shrewdest of the lords of claw, As bold as a buffalo, with a voice as soft as wild honey Unbridled, unmastered, unafraid. Bagrheera the black panther. And now__ Behold, the villain of my tale. The killer, the man-eater... the assassin who first brought murder Shere Khan, the tiger. It is said that in his first kill__... when he was Cain to some when he ran from the scene of his crime... the trees and creepers and striped his yellow hide This evil lord must have his dish-lickers... his bullies for attendants. Tabaqui the jackal. And the hyena__... hungry for the scraps But my tale is not alone I will tell you also of the snake, Kaa, the oracle who taught Mother Eve for trickery and sin. What is the book of life itself the struggle between village and jungle, Under the mantle of wild creepers many a ruined City lies forgotten Yea, where a thousand war Chariots before whom all men bowed their heads. Nothing remains but a trellis But what of the great maharaja, He has left many such a palace The bandar-logs __ The outcasts of the jungle. First you must picture me Buldeo, the mighty hunter. It was a long time ago... and very far away... on a summer's evening Ajao. Ajao. Again some palaver. That fool would make speeches Come, Durga. Let, s listen to him. Ajao. You cannot build your houses We have to plan out our village. Someday there will be a mighty city here. A mighty city with marble houses. The temple shall be there, That's where I wanted the bean patch. No that's for the marketplace, And the barbershop will face the temple. I shall find someplace outside your mighty city. Go Durga. Take the child Nathoo. Come Grandfather. Did you hear that? We're going to have a marketplace Aye we'll have all that But have you and your hundred years Sit here Grandfather. There Nathoo. Now. Go back to your work. Nathoo? Where are you my baby? Rao. Look. Our little Nathoo, Now don't worry Messua. I'll look for him right away. Nathoo. Nathoo. - Nathoo. Nathoo. Nat... Buldeo. Tiger. My husband. Rao. Abdullah. Singh. Abdullah. Ali. Mohammed. Singh. Tiger. No. No. Poor master. Poor Messua. Let us all go and look for the child. All men bring your spears. Ali Singh Abdullah. Torches. Follow me. Nathoo. Nathoo. Nathoo. Nathoo. Poor little baby. Poor little Nathoo. - And that poor mother. Is it every woman who can have Do you believe that Subahdar? Oh yes memsahib. And His Excellency your father, of wolf children from the Indian hills. - It is true. In the beginning was it not written... that the she-wolves Were not the wolves the foster parents Little naked and bold... the man's Cub entered the wolves' Cave. Ahai. He felt just as much at home with the cubs Nathoo. Nathoo. Nathoo. Lost and tired, he fell asleep among his Akkela the father wolf, knew that Shere Khan is prowling outside So they took him into their family. Nathoo. He grew up with the cubs. Father wolf taught him his business meant just as much to him All the lords of the jungle He had only one enemy- Did Mowgli live to hunt Shere Khan? Did he live? Oh. Twelve years had passed... and Shere Khan was on the trail See the silver moon Hear the breezes croon Jungle's cradle tune Lulla lullaby Now the darkness swings Down on velvet wings While our river sings Lulla lullaby Sleep sleep up above Stars keep watch with eyes of love Sleep sleep baby hush-a-bye Sleep sleep eyelids close Dreaming dreams of pearl and rose Sleep sleep baby hush-a-bye Saw the silver moon Fear the breezes croon Jungle's cradle tune Lulla lullaby Wait. Wait. Let me handle him. Buldeo. Buldeo. Ow. He bit me. He is a wild boy. Cover him up. Cover him up. Who are you boy? Can't you hear? Give me a torch. A torch. Give me that torch. This boy has never seen fire before. Yes he is a wild boy. We must be kind to him. Release him. Release him? Are you mad? This is a thing of the jungle. Let me look. Let me look. Look at the scars on his arms and legs. Those points on his bones-- Poor child. This boy has been reared in the jungle. He has the evil eye. I begin to think he has. Moonshine. I think this boy is Messua's little baby Could this boy be your's Messua? No. He's not mine. But he's a handsome boy. Any woman would like to have But my Nathoo was soft and plump. But, mistress, how could he be plump I warn you all. He has the evil eye. No, Buldeo. He is some poor, lost lad-- But I am a lonely woman, I will shelter him for some other woman He is a wolf. He will bring down the jungle upon us. What the jungle has taken, Aye. Aye. Take this boy into thy house my sister. And out of your little hoard of money, for I have saved his life on this day. - Release him. Are you going to turn this devil loose A gun. - Buldeo-- A gun. Buldeo. Now release him. No. No. Boy. Boy. Will you come with me? Come. Oh. It's, it's all right. Come on. Come along. Come. Come. It's all right. Come along. Come. Down upon our heads we have called the curse of the beast. No more shall we prosper. The wild pig will trample down our vines. The tiger will stalk our streets. We have opened our doors to the devil. Don't look upon evil. Mahala. Get home to bed. At least I can keep my own daughter Get back, Kpota. Is that anyway to treat I remember the day I gave Wolf-- Uh, wolf boy. Uh... Oh, those feet have never worn shoes. No, you are not my son. But you look very much like my son Nathoo. Nathoo called me 'Mother'. 'Mother'., 'Mother'., M-- Mother. Uhh. And what did the wolves... call you? Wolves. M... Mowgli. Mowgli? A little frog? Yes, you were like a little frog to them, And so you are Mowgli to me. Come. Come on. For months and months after that night... Mowgli was busy learning the ways, What are you doing? You are like a little panther. I thought someone had found - Hiding place? - What is this? What is it for? What is money for? It lives in a hole like a cobra? No. If we need a bag of rice, I give these He gives us the rice. - What a fool that merchant must be. Will the Man-Pack give us Yes. Will Buldeo give me a tooth? Tooth? You have all your teeth. No. A -A sharp tooth. Oh, a knife? Yes. A knife tooth, like a tiger's knife. What need have you for a knife? To sink it in the throat of my enemy. Your enemy? Ha. You talk about and Raksha, the better it is in the jungle Now who could be your enemy? Shere Khan, the tiger. Tell Buldeo to sell you a knife. I shall have a tooth. I shall have a tooth. My father says I mustn't speak to you. What happened to him? My father shot him. We missed you six moons ago. He was Baloo's cousin. He had no man for an enemy. But my father kills every bear he sees. Why? Because he is a great hunter. He kills them even when he's not hungry? Hungry? We don't eat bears. Then why did he bring him here? To show how brave he is. And my father was very brave That old tiger? He lived on lizards and rats. He was too old to hunt rabbits. I see. You could kill the bear I kill Baloo's cousin? Fishing with a bear? He looks in the river, He knocks it out. Didn't I tell you not to speak I told Messua to keep you Messua sent me here to talk to you. She sent me to get a tooth. A tooth? Yes. This is the tooth I want. Put that knife down And then you would put my head like the old Khan there. But I would spring as I die Now, now. You're not in the jungle, boy. No. No, I am not in the jungle, Buldeo. I am with the Man-Pack, What are you, boy? I was until now a cub. I can run with the jungle as I please. If you had a knife... would you go back to the jungle? The knife is yours for two annas. Messua gave me three. One, two, three. There. Three is more than two. Yes. More than two. Now get out of my house. See, Shere Khan? - 'Tis for you-- deep in your throat. Won't you be afraid Afraid of the jungle? Why? I'm of the wolf pack. Then why did you buy the knife? For Shere Khan, the tiger. This is for him. He drove me out of the jungle. He went away far off... but he swore he would lay my bones I also made a little promise. I have told the wolves I would kill him. You can speak their tongue? Can you talk to Rama, the great herd bull? Rama is a dumb slave. He has been with the Man-Pack so long... he cannot talk to anyone. Can you speak to him? What did he say? Don't you know what the monkey people 'We, the monkey people, We know this is true Mowgli, will you let me Yes. Tonight when the moon rises. - Are you afraid? Let's go. It's a wolf. What did he say? Wood and water. Wind and tree. Jungle favor go with thee. You have been given the favor of the jungle. We be of one blood... you and I. We be of one blood, you and I. Come, Mowgli. Come. Come. Come. Ahai, Hathi. I am with the Man-Pack now. See, I have my tooth-- He said Shere Khan is far away... but I had better take care and hide Hathi, will you warn me Thank you, brothers. Then we shall see whose bones Hold on. Tight. Bagheera. Mowgli. Your claws are sharp and strong. But not as good as mine. Look. Who is man that I should Brown digger, eater of earth. I am Mowgli of the jungle, Now that I have my tooth, Mowgli, come back. There. Mighty hunters, who killed everything Why did they go away? Why did I go away? Because I was a man cub, The jungle knew I was afraid This was the king's palace. King? What is a king? Oh, Mowgli. You know so much, This was a great walled city... a city with hundreds of elephants and thousands and thousands of men. And it all belonged to a great king. And where is this great king now? And where is this great king now? Where is he now? Where is he now? Mahala? Mahala? - Mahala? Here I am. Mahala, are you hurt? No, I'm all right. The king's treasure chamber. Look. The emeralds. Pearls. This is like the stuff I gave Buldeo The stuff that passes from hand to hand Only this is yellow, and that was brown. Let's get back to the light. These pebbles are no good to eat. There is nothing here. Nothing. Am I nothing? Father of cobras, we be of one blood, She's only a little cub from the Man-Pack. She means thee no harm. Who art thou with the knife Mowgli, they call me. I am of the jungle. Father of cobras, who art thou? I am the warden of the king's treasure. The great king built the stone above me to those who come to steal. Three times the stone Look at thy feet. The thieves are still here. But I am no thief. Indeed. Be still, Mahala. Be still. Oh, no, boy. Let her make some sport. The others did so until I touched them. Then they whimpered a while... sighed and were still. Kill him, Mowgli. Kill him. Kill him? Don't be afraid. Look. Our father of cobras is so old, Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. I am ashamed. There has been too much talk of killing. Come, Mahala. We'll go now. Keep that silly treasure. But I'll take this. I can use it to prod Rama with. Look at the ruby, Mowgli. You could buy hundreds of villages with it. Aye, boy. Thousands of villages. Take it with thee. But see that it does not kill thee at last. Kill me? This stone? Yes. I have outlived my poison... but that ruby holds more death It will kill and kill and kill... for killing's sake. My strength is dried up, It is death, it is death, it is death. But take the ruby if thou wilt. Nay, father of cobras. I believe thee. We shall go as we came. Aye. Ye be wise to take no death with thee. May I take just this one piece, Mowgli? Keep it if you like. Get up, lazy bones. I dreamed I was a princess Get up. There's no fire in the grate, But it was not a dream. I saw the great king's city. Get on with you. Dream? This is no dream. Maybe I am dreaming. This is pure gold. Who gave this to you, my darling child? The white cobra. Cobra? Yes. I did not want the diamonds. Diamonds? Nor the big ruby. Big ruby? This big. This big. Where? What nonsense is this? Where is this room-- this ruby? When did you go there? Whose gold is this, Mahala? The great king's gold. In the treasure chamber I tell you, Father, Mowgli said Mowgli? You have been in the jungle? Last night Mowgli took me there. But, Father, you will not hurt him? I would not harm a hair on his head. But you must never let anyone Not a living soul, do you hear? Yes, Father.

Suppose the tiger should kill him. No, no, we must save him. How kind you all are He really is a sweet boy. I knew you would come to love him. Love him? I wish I had a boy like him. Now, don't worry. If he's not back in a short time, Kaa. Kaa. I want to sleep. Go away. I have to talk to you. Who are you? Can't you see, Kaa? What does the Law of the Jungle say? We be of one blood... ye and I.

You know all things? I know that Shere Khan has killed... and eaten... and now sleeps by the bamboo. Tabaqui the jackal told me so... uh, before he passed on. Tabaqui? Yes, indeed. Here he is. How may I slay his master, Kaa? He'd kill you with one blow. Let us go upstream. Hold on, little brother. Shere Khan is nothing but a big cat... and all cats fear the water. But Shere Khan will not follow me Since you're a man... use your cunning. And if I made him angry, Kaa... will he follow me into the river? If he will not catch you first. Thank you, wisest of all.

Scream. Scream, you witches of the forest. Scream. I'll burn that mother witch Messua... and I'll come back and set fire to your jungle... when the east wind blows. I'll burn you all. Burn you all. Burn you all. Hathi. Thou knowest the village They're idle, senseless and cruel. They do not kill the weaker for food... but for sport. When they are full-fed, they would throw This I have seen. It is not well that the Man-Pack Kill them? Why? What good are their white bones to me? We shall let the jungle in upon them... and give the village back They will burn us both. Why did you fight them, Durga? It was I who brought him into the world. Aye, mistress. You could have saved yourself, Durga. No, mistress. If you must leave the world tonight, Buldeo is here. Look.

Their fight is my fight. Ahai. He's no longer my son. He's a godling of the woods. So I didn't have my revenge after all. I became no Mharaja... of a mighty city. Even the little village burned to the ground. In my struggle with the jungle... as you see, milords... I was beaten. And then? What happened then? What became of Mowgli And how did you escape from the fire? That, memsahib... is another story.
