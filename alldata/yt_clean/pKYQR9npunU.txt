Good morning, Jane! What's for breakfast today? Good morning. Emily. I thought we could make pancakes. Yum, that sounds great! What do we need? We need flour, eggs, sugar and milk. I think we have everything. Let's check. Here's the flour and sugar. Do you see the eggs? Yes. They're in the fridge. Great! Now, where's the milk? Umm, Jane... I don't see any milk. Oh no... I forgot to buy milk! Oh no! That's important for pancakes. What should we do? Maybe we can borrow some from our neighbor, Mrs. Johnson? That's a good idea. I'll come with you. Emily, we have a problem. What's wrong? The washing machine is broken. Oh no! What happened? I was doing laundry and it just stopped working. That's terrible. Did you try restarting it? Yes, but it didn't work. It's completely dead. Maybe we should call a repairman. I think that's a good idea. Do you know any good repair services? I can look one up online. Do you have your phone? Yes, here it is. Thank you, Emily. Hi, we need a repairman for our washing machine. It stopped working. Sure, I can come by this afternoon. What's your address? 132, My Street, Kingston. Okay, I've got it. Thank you. See you soon. Did they say when they can come? Yes, they'll be here this afternoon. Oh no, I don't have enough change. How much do you need? I'm short by 50 cents. Let me check if I have some change. Here you go, 50 cents. Thanks so much, Alex. I'll pay you back as soon as I can. Don't worry about it. It's just 50 cents. Still, I appreciate it. What did you get? Just a soda. I really needed something to drink. Yeah, it's really hot today. Exactly. And soda is the best option for cooling! Did you hear about what happened with Lisa at work? No, what happened? Tell me! So, apparently she had a huge argument with her boss yesterday. Really? What was it about? I heard it was about the project deadline. She said the timeline was impossible, Wow. That's intense. How did it end? Well, Lisa stormed out and hasn't come back to work since. Everyone's talking about it. I can imagine. Office drama is always so interesting. Totally. And get this, I also heard that John and Rachel are dating now. No way! I thought John was still with his girlfriend from college. They broke up last month. Oh no! A bird just pooped on me! Oh no! That's so unlucky. Are you okay? I'm fine, but my favorite shirt is dirty! I hope the stain comes out. This is my favorite shirt. Don't worry. We'll use some stain remover and it should be fine. Emily, I ran out of toothpaste. Did you check the bathroom cabinet? Yes, I looked everywhere. There's none left. Do you need to brush your teeth now? Yes. I have to leave for work soon. You can use mine. I have an extra tube in my room. Really? Thanks, Emily. You're a lifesaver. No problem. Let me get it for you. Here you go. This should last until you can buy more. Thanks so much. I'll buy a new tube on my way home from work. Emily, the power went out. Do we have candles? Yeah, I have some in the kitchen. Let me get them. Great, let's light them up. Hey, since it's dark and spooky, why don't we tell some ghost stories? That sounds fun! Do you have a good one? I have one. It's about a haunted house. Ready? Ready. Once upon a time, there was an old house at the end of the street. Everyone said it was haunted. People would hear strange noises at night... They heard footsteps, whispers, and sometimes, even screams. That's creepy! What happened next? One night, a brave man decided to spend the night in the house. He heard the noises too. He followed them to the attic... Suddenly, the door slammed shut behind him. He was trapped. He heard a knock outside the window What did he do? He tried to escape, but the shadow got closer and closer until... Ahhh! What was that?! I don't know! Maybe it's just the wind. Sarah. I can't remember my password. Heh? For which account? For my email. I need to check some important messages. Did you try all the usual passwords? Yes, I tried everything I could think of. Maybe you wrote it down somewhere? I usually do, but I can't find it now. Why don't you try the 'Forgot Password' option? Good idea. Let me see. What does it say? It's asking for my security questions. Do you remember the answers? I hope so. Oh! It worked. Done. Now it's asking for a new password. Make sure to write it down this time. I will. All set. Thank you so much, Sarah. Emily, my favorite show isn't on. Really? What happened? I don't know. It's supposed to be on now, but it's not showing. Did you check the TV guide? Maybe they changed the schedule. Good idea. Let me check. It says there's a special event on tonight, so my show is canceled. That's disappointing. Do you want to watch something else? I guess we could. Do you have any suggestions? How about we watch a movie instead? I have a few good ones saved. That sounds like a good idea. What movies do you have? I have some comedies Let's watch a comedy. I could use a good laugh. Okay. Do you want some popcorn? Yes, please. I'll get the popcorn while you start the movie. So, for the next project, I think we should... Oh no! I spilled water on my laptop! Jane! Quick, turn it off and unplug it! Okay, it's off. What do I do next? Use these napkins to dry it off I hope it's not ruined. Let's also leave it open to air dry. Don't turn it on until you're sure Got it. No problem. Do you have important files on there? Yes I do. I really should back them up more often. It's a good habit to have. Do you use any cloud services? Not regularly. I guess I should start using one. Definitely. It's really convenient and keeps your data safe. Do you have any recommendations? I use Google Drive and Dropbox. Both are reliable and easy to use. I'll look into those. Thanks, David. Jane, are you okay? You don't look so well. Oh, I have a cold. I've been feeling terrible all day. Oh no, Jane. That's awful. Do you need anything? I could use some tea My nose is really stuffy. Of course. I'll make you some tea right away. Do we have any medicine? Yes, I think there's some in the bathroom cabinet. Okay, I'll get that for you, too. Here you go. Oh, thanks so much, Emily. No problem. How long have you been feeling like this? Since yesterday. I think it got worse overnight. Did you get any rest? Not much. I kept waking up because I couldn't breathe well. That sounds rough. Maybe you should see a doctor if it doesn't get better soon. I will if it gets worse. Hopefully, it's just a minor cold. Excuse me, I have an appointment with Dr. Lee. What is your name, please? Anthony. Please follow me. Dr. Lee is in the second room. Thank you! Hi, Dr. Lee. Hi Mr. Anthony. Why are you here today? My wisdom tooth hurts. For how long? Four days. Okay, let me check it first. Can you open your mouth, please? Yes. A bit wider. Is everything okay? You've got a bit of decay in this one. Is it serious now? Yeah... You have to take this tooth out! Oh, my gosh. No worries. You will feel better right after it is removed. Jesus! You're still asleep? Oh, my.,, What time is it now? Gosh, Leah, it's 2 P.M... and you're still asleep!!! All you do is partying all night and come home late! Don't be a spoilsport, Michele. The party last night was lit! You should've been there instead of staying at home reading all those boring books! Yeah, because these so-called boring books don't get me an F like your cool party! And I gotta tell you, the final exam is next week. You'd better get ready for it. Wait, what? OMG how can I not know this? Jesus, Can I borrow your notes? Gosh, you don't even go to class. Well, I'll wake up early tomorrow then. You only do that when pigs fly, Leah! I know you so well! Newton. I need Paul Moran's file. Here you are. Thank you. Have you finished the research Bella asked you to do? She said she'll need it next week. So I'll finish it later. Really? I just talked to her. She said she'd like to meet you to get a report on the research. I don't know. I guess she wanted to discuss something about research. Newton. Have you finished the research yet? Not yet... But I need it now. But you said I can finish it next week. I know. So now you and I will do it together. I want it as soon as possible. Ok. Let's do it. Hi, Ms Flight Attendant. Can I get a glass of water, please? Sure thing. Would you like ice with that? Probably not, just plain water is fine. Here you go! Is there anything else I can get for you? Actually, yes. Can I get a blanket and a pillow? I'm feeling a bit cold. Of course! Excuse me. Sorry to bother you again. Can I order a meal for the flight? Absolutely. We have a few options to choose from. Are you in the mood for something specific? I'm thinking of the chicken dish. Does that come with a side salad? Yes, it does. And would you like anything to drink with that? Can I get a glass of orange juice, please? Of course! And for dessert, we have a choice of apple pie or cheesecake. Which would you like? I'll have the apple pie. Great! I'll put in your order, and it should be served shortly. Is there anything else I can get for you? No. That's all for now. Thank you! You're welcome. Don't hesitate to let me know if you need anything else during the flight. Hey, Jack! If you could have your dream house, what would it be like? Oh, that's an exciting question, Emily. Let me picture it. Well, my dream house would be a cozy cottage nestled in the countryside. That sounds lovely, Jack. What features would your dream cottage have? I imagine it with a charming stone exterior, a thatched roof... and a beautiful garden surrounding it. That sounds picturesque. How about the interior? What would it be like? Inside, I'd love to have a small living room with a fireplace, perfect for cozy evenings. The kitchen would be bright and open... with a large farmhouse style dining table. That sounds inviting. And what about the bedrooms? I'd have a master bedroom with a big window overlooking the serene countryside. And a guest room for friends and family to stay comfortably. It sounds like a peaceful retreat. Any other special features you'd like to include? Absolutely! I'd have a library filled with books and I can work in there. It sounds like a dream come true. I can imagine the tranquility and joy it would bring. Indeed, Emily. Having a home that reflects my personality and provides a sanctuary is something I've always dreamed of. I can understand that. Well, I hope one day your dream house becomes a reality, Jack. Thank you, Emily. Who knows? Dreams have a way of coming true. And what about you? What would your dream house be like? Haizz Are you okay? I'm okay. Just... you know My husband can't say 'no' to anybody at his workplace. The result is him being overloaded with work most of the time. Many a time he even used to work on Sundays. I've heard you say that before. Are you worried about this? No. Last month, my son started his first job Oh, congratulations. But what happened? I told him not to take on more Did he listen to you? Yes. But my advice worked for only one week. After that, he started coming and now sometimes it is 10 or 10.30 pm. Did you ask him why? Yes. He said he could not get a cab. Could that really be the case? But the thing is. on weekends also he sits with a laptop It is truly like father, like son. You got a minute? Yeah, sure. What's wrong? Well, I think we should think about getting a family doctor. What do you think? Family doctor? Why do you bring this up now? Because a doctor is what we need right now. Duh. It makes no sense. Why? The hospital is not very far from here, though. What do you mean 'Why'? Home health care is essential, especially for our little Mimi. And I don't want to put off my plans to spend the whole day at the hospital, Ben. Gosh, Here we go again. It'd be more convenient and time saving to have a family doctor, don't you think? Waiting at the hospital... Jesus it sucks! Public hospitals are even worse. Come on...it's not that horrible. Hi, Tracy! Is that you? Yes. Hello, Sam. What are you doing at the airport? Are you going anywhere? No. I just came here to say goodbye to my brother. He's going to study abroad in Finland. That's so cool! I know, right? He's sitting over there waiting for his flight. How about you? Are you going on a vacation or something? Actually I'm flying back to my home country. Where were you born? I was born in London, England. Oh, yeah. I can recognize that you're English from your accent. Hahaha. Oh, sorry, but I have to leave now. No, it's okay! Sure, take care and have a safe flight! See you after the summer! Hannah, I just heard the news. Will you really leave the company? It's true, I'm leaving the company. Oh, no. Why? I see you're still doing a great job. Colleagues also love you very much. I know. And I also love this job, too. But I'm getting married soon. I cannot continue to work so far away from home. I'll miss you so much, Hanna. No one will have lunch with me anymore. Don't worry. We will go for coffee together sometimes. Sure. I handed the job over to Mr. Alex and asked Julia for help. Did you meet our boss? Yes. If you have any difficulty, just call me. Thank you. Are we still going to eat together this evening? Of course! Was the field trip with your class fun? Yes, Mom, It was really fun. Tell me more about it. We went to visit the museum and did pottery. Can you make pottery yourself? Yes. I made a ceramic vase for you to arrange flowers. Wow. That's wonderful! Thank you, honey. I like this trip. What an exciting experience! I'm glad to hear that. But it would be better if the weather wasn't so hot, Right. Today is so hot to go outside. I was so sweaty and drank a lot of water. I know that. Hey, Emily! Have you ever been to a horse race before? No. Alex. This will be my first time. The atmosphere is amazing. I can't wait to see the horses up close. They're such majestic creatures. True! The power and grace of these horses is incredible. Are there any famous horses racing today? Yes, there's a champion horse called Thunderbolt. It's known for its speed. Wow! I hope we get to see Thunderbolt in action. Me too! Let's cheer for Thunderbolt and enjoy the race. Do you know how to bet on the horses? Yes. It's pretty simple. You choose a horse and place your bet. What if I pick the wrong worse? Don't worry, it's all part of the game. Sometimes luck is on your side. Maybe the betting game is not for me. I'll just cheer for all the horses then. I'm gonna be so excited as the horses thunder down the track. The crowd is cheering. Yes. I have some binoculars to get a better view of the race. Wonderful! Now shout like me. Go Thunderbolt! Rachel! I'm here! OMG, I'm so sorry, Linda. The traffic was terrible today. I couldn't even move my car How long have you been waiting? No, Rachel. Take a deep breath and keep calm first. I also just got here And I got stuck in the traffic as well. How did you get here? I came by train. And the train I went to was crowded with people. I felt like there was someone stepping on me. Hahaha! Yeah, you're right. Today is the weekend, so everybody's out. I hope the movie we're about to Have you ever read any Yes! A lot! Especially when I was young. My grandma always read Grimm's stories to me. Cool! What is your favorite one? I'd say Cinderella is the best of the best! I love the motif of how the villains get punished, and how the good people like Cinderella I know, right? To me, Snow White and Snow White is also a nice princess Yeah! And both of them got That's the most exciting part! Hahaha! Emma, what are you studying so intently? I want to find out more information about aliens after watching the movie &quot;Home&quot; last night. Sounds interesting, so what was that movie about? It theorizes that one day the Earth will be controlled by aliens. The film revolves around the challenging and humorous journey to find a mother of little Tucy and Oh. How did you find that movie? An interesting movie full of adventure, but also very meaningful. The two main characters of the film are total opposites, but they gradually become close. They go together and realize many valuable lessons together. I'm curious how the friendship between humans and aliens will be. I'll probably look for that movie today.
