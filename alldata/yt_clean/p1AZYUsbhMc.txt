Seven days in Avdiivka. Video diary of fighters of the 1st company of the 2nd assault battalion of the Third assault brigade. Walking out! Lively! Come on! Let's run across quickly. We walk out after 100 meters. Bro, who am I after? - After me. I'm the first. - I'm after &quot;Berlin&quot;. - Yes. To the left side. Boys, let's start the game. - Attention! Move! Gain distance! Let's go in the house. - Plus. Boys, a few words. For the subscribers. - All's fucking fine. Avdiivka. 2024. We have a yard like this. &quot;Bandera&quot;. A few words. About the situation in Avdiivka. I can't say much yet. But... I think it will be rough here. The white house, right? - Right one. Second. Go in. Go in. Faster. We lost our shit by the time we got here! Fucking crazy! - Just don't shout. Catch your breath. Get ready. Here is one house. Fucking torn down. And there, you see, in the distance, there is a metal balcony. Yes. Yes. I see. - So you need to get to that house. Let's fucking roll. Run. Run. Run. Next house. Salam, brothers. - How many people came? - Mine all. &quot;Student&quot;. Third day. Avdiivka. He's wearing cropped pants already. It's -5C outside. Captain &quot;Baptist&quot;. A few words for our subscribers. - Captain already? - Well, captain. - Used to be just &quot;Baptist&quot; last I recall. Join the ranks of the Third SABr. Fight for your country. It will be scary at first. But then you'll get in the groove and, I think, you'll like it. What's up? - You need to shoot constantly. Where are you shooting? - So, do you see those two houses there? - Yes. - They are in that distant barn. &quot;Ronin&quot;, get up here! &quot;Sheva&quot;! - Yes. - I'm going to work with my GP too. Get back. Get back. Get back. &quot;Hal&quot;. &quot;Hal&quot;. That was us working. Now the faggots have opened fire. - So you made them mad? - Yes. Yes. - Detect their firing spots. While keeping cautious yourselves. While keeping cautious yourselves. Detect their firing positions if possible. Who's that working? &quot;Sheva&quot; or them? From there, right? - Yes. &quot;Sichen'&quot; reading you. - &quot;Sichen'&quot;, now do not waste ammo without urgent need, do not waste ammo.&quot; So what, we fucking get offended and go home? Still alive. Saying hi to everyone. Good morning everyone. Keep in touch with us. We'll go out, show you the situation around. Listen to your mom. Defend your country. Avdiivka basements are our new home. - Our dear subscribers are only those who help the army. - Yes. Only those who help the army. All the rest are fucking faggots. Those who don't donate, don't help - go fight, bitches. &quot;Hal&quot;. - Here. - I'll go bring them ammo. - Plus. Plus. Come on. Come on. And stay on the radio! There is no position. We can &quot;carousel&quot;-work from here. Tell them to zinc the right flank so that they don't bypass us! They won't fucking pass here! &quot;Sheva&quot;. &quot;Sheva&quot;. What do you want? To run across to the boys? Hold on a second. I'll load the mag and cover you. &quot;Sheva&quot;, are you ready? - Yes. Go. What, you ready, &quot;Rulya&quot;? - Yes. - Show them hell. Hit? That was a drone. Drone! Drone! The faggots got mad. Is that coming at us? - Yes. - Where from? - Probably from inside the house. Was it flying at the roofs? At the roofs - Yes. Yes. - From inside the house. From inside the house. We need to take him down. - Tell &quot;Berlin&quot; to work. &quot;Aizek&quot;. &quot;Aizek&quot;. - Here. - Tell &quot;Berlin&quot; to work. One more. One more. - One more. Same spot. - Same spot. Same spot. Tell him to try to throw it in the left half of the house. In the left window on the second floor. &quot;Romeo&quot;. &quot;Romeo&quot;. - What? Fuck. I already forgot what I wanted to ask. You fucking kidding me. Tell &quot;Bandera&quot;... Tell &quot;Bandera&quot; to zinc the sectors. So that no one crosses the road. Do you copy? - Alright. Fucking what? Control the sectors! Everyone, save ammo. They're provoking us with their shooting so that we shoot back. &quot;Studik&quot;. Well done. Good. Good. Which azimuth? How do we detect it? Where they're blasting at our guys from? Give the azimuth to the command observation point. &quot;Baptist&quot;! - Yes. - Control all that shit where the faggots are sitting! And tell &quot;Kansas&quot; to fucking shoot at them if necessary, but not to open fire in vain! What fucking advance? They just slightly bothered you from the two-story house. So, I got mad at that bullshit and said: &quot;Since no one wants to fight, then I'll go start a fucking war myself!&quot; So here I came and arranged it, damn it! And they were just getting ready. I arrived on time. Who's there? - Me. &quot;Aizek&quot;. &quot;Aizek&quot;. - You're &quot;Aizek&quot;-&quot;Aizek&quot;? Come on, kid. How the fuck does he go in there and then goes back in there? - Fuck knows it. - Fucking Casperovsky! Fucking workdays damn it. I hope they replace us. At least tomorrow. Because I can't do it anymore. I need to sleep. Normally. Not for two hours. Have you slept at all during these three days? - Well, a little bit. Dozed off a bit. We are almost completely surrounded. If we don't get out of Avdiivka and this camera gets into the faggots' hands, then know this, you bitches: We fucking hate you creatures. We will be fucking &quot;biting&quot; until the last. We will kill you to the last soldier. We will stand until the last fucking meter. Do you get it, you fucking pricks?
