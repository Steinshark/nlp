- Once again, behind me are 100 people, and they range from the age of one all the way to age 100, and they're all gonna be competing for $250,000. Everyone go to your cubes, and unlike any of my past videos, these 100 people will decide themselves who deserves the 250 grand. Everybody, enter your cubes! The challenge has officially begun, if any of you decide to leave or even touch the red line, you will be eliminated. How far do you think you'll - I intend to go the whole way. - All right, let's see how Do you think you'll win the money? All right, have fun with the tablet. - This is the line that's gonna make it all the way to the end. - 48, feeling great. - It was clear from the beginning that the middle-aged people were the most focused and determined, but that didn't go for everybody. If you step out, you lose. Okay, the two-year-old is now eliminated. As you'd expect, the first to leave were the youngest, Did you have a good time? We'll ask in a year when he can speak, and some of the older folks. - Yes sir, I'm ready to go. - All right. - And already, by hour one of filming this video, six people have been eliminated, and even more are about to be. Unlike this video right here, that was more of a last to leave, this challenge is about making friendships and convincing people to like you. They decide who wins the 250 grand and I didn't know it yet, but this video was by far the most intense video we've ever filmed. - Shame on you! - Are you serious? - You're a kind person, don't eliminate me. - Attention everybody, over the past hour I hope you've all had a chance to make some friends because you're going to need them. Throw 10 minutes on the board. In the next 10 minutes, I need 10 of you to leave. - Literally can't. - And ultimately it is your to convince 10 people to leave their queue, and if you're not able to accomplish this, we're gonna randomly eliminate 25 of you. Good luck. - My gosh, I don't wanna do the 25 random. - We need somebody to leave! - I'm not leaving! - If you're past retirement age, you gotta go, if you are not above the age of 12, you gotta go! - Already a minute's gone by and no one's left. - If seven people leave with me, I'll go out! - Please! - Help! - I cannot be kicked out this soon. - Please, guys! - Kids, you can come out! You gonna take one for the team? - I can't do it, I came here for the long haul. - Yo, do it for the greater good! - 53, go! - No. - Are you gonna get out? I'll buy you Roblox, I promise. We have one, we have one! - And even though 89 decided to take one for the team, we still need eight more people. Nobody, no takers? - Not to be rude, but like all the older they got like retirement money. I'm in college, I'm struggling right now. - Five, four, three, two, one! - You all were unfortunately not able to come to an agreement, which means a random will now be eliminated and to ensure it's random, we're using this machine to pick the contestants one by one. Chandler, grab a ping pong ball. Our first elimination is Number 18. - Oh, that sucks. - Please, almost, no! - The next elimination is 85. Remember, you guys chose this. 82. - Number 80. - I'm sorry, boss. - Okay. - 99. Don't worry, 12, 24, 22, 19. - Oh, this is brutal. - 29. - I'm sorry, son. - And our final elimination, it was 13! - Chandler, look at all I'm sorry. - We just lost 25 people. - Grateful that it's not me, though. - Still here, but I don't know if I feel good about it. - Every number that came out, &quot;Is that gonna be me? Is that gonna be me? Am I going home today?&quot; - 67 of you remain, congratulations! And as always, once someone is eliminated, we obviously destroy their cube. and after the onslaught I thought I'd give them and so I let them hang out which ended up being a - Hey, if you don't wanna spend the night, all you gotta do is just - That's what I'm gonna do. - Because by the time Day Two started, so many people had been eliminated, we were already down to 55 contestants remaining. We're gonna start the new day by seeing if you can all unanimously agree on who should win this $250,000. If all of you can agree on the same person, they instantly win the $250,000, but if only one of you vote for someone different, we're gonna do a challenge and eliminate a bunch of you. Who do you think should win the 250 grand? - 14. - Who do you think - 11. All right, well it's already ruined. You all cannot unanimously agree on who should win that money, so we have to do a challenge. Each row now has to decide on a captain and that captain will then represent all the contestants in their row for the next challenge. Please make sure you it will all make sense, but it's gonna be very ruthless. For the next 15 minutes each row tried to decide who their captain was going to be. - Do you wanna be the captain? - If you don't want to. - As long as you choose - I will not get y'all out. - What age do you want - 30. - 30. - We got it! - Hey, do one of y'all volunteer? - I volunteer. - 64. - Who in your row do - Me. I came here to fight for this thing and I'm gonna win it. - All right, your captains have been chosen. This is where things get interesting and a little cutthroat. We're gonna offer money and if any of you captains you and your entire row are completely eliminated. My first offer is a $1,000. - Stay tough, 42! - I ain't going nowhere. I'm not eliminating my row for $1,000. - I'm not moving! - 14, please don't. - Y'all are safe, I'm not doing it. - Offer Number Two, $5,000. - Don't do it! - If one of you step out, eliminate your entire row, I will give you this $5,000. - No, 42! - Don't eliminate us, 42! - Don't expect me to go - Don't do it, 30! with every decision I make. - Our next offer is $10,000. - Don't do it! - 10 grand isn't worth I like them a lot more than 10 grand. - 20 grand. We're going until one of you step out. - That ain't enough, that ain't enough. - We're now at $50,000. At this point, all the captains have been holding strong, but it was clear once we some of the captains were having a harder time than others. - Don't do it, 42! - Geez. - All right everybody, let's really have some fun. The next offer is, that puts us at $80, that puts us at $90, we're not done, put it up there. The new offer is $100,000 for the first captain to step out of their cube. 14, 30, 42, 64 or Mr. 100, I just need one of you five to step out so I can make you rich. - No, 30! - Really starting to - No, 42! - Dude, I'm gonna be hated on so bad. - Oh, I see 30 - Don't move! - Don't you dare! - Oh, he's doing it! - I'm doing it. - I'm sorry. - Are you serious? 30, what the heck! - I'm shocked. - Shame on you, Shame on you! - That's crazy. - 30 has stepped out, All of the 20's and all of the 30's are now eliminated. You guys should have picked - I can't, I can't look. I gotta think of my son. - You lied, 30! - This line right here- - This is the line that's gonna make it all the way to the end. - Everyone in the 20's, you can leave, everyone in the 30's, you're all eliminated, I'm sorry. - What's going through - That we got screwed! - I kept thinking, like, that sets my kid up for a long, long time. - Because of how much betrayal has been shown so far in this video, the 40's made an alliance to try to keep any of them from getting out, no matter what. - 40 alliance hung together, there's four of us. - It's that time again, cast up your votes and see if you can all decide on a winner, and like usual, they couldn't agree. So, we'll do a challenge and eliminate some more people. I'll be right back. The next challenge that has all the remaining So go ahead, Chandler, spin it. Currently there are 36 of you remaining and we're gonna spin the wheel until we eliminate 16 of bringing your total down to the final 20. All right, 67, I'm coming to your cube, and while I'm walking over to his cube, Chandler, spin it again. That wheel is going to land and when it does, you're going to have to decide whether or not to eliminate them. - 55. - The challenge is simple, 67, you could choose if 55 is eliminated or stays in the challenge. - Before you decide, it's only fair that 55 - Thank you everybody, it's been a great time, good luck, guys. - You don't wanna ask to kindly not be eliminated or anything? - No, 'cause if I was I'd do the same thing. - I mean, he's giving you - Uh- - Wow, okay. - Somebody's got to go- - So, is that saying - Yes. - Okay, the decision is final then. - All right. - Thanks, guys. - Chandler, spin the wheel. - I mean, he gave me the - That was an easy first one, surely they'll all go that well. Ooh, 47, now we're gonna give her before you make a decision. - Have peace of mind, I would love to stay, I don't wanna go. - What is your decision? - She'll stay. - You survived. - And because she did not get eliminated, she now decides who stays and who goes. Technically you could and be safe. No risk of elimination, but that'd be very cruel. - It would be. - 43. - Would love to stay on our little team, but it's ultimately up to you. - We're staying together. 43 is staying. Love you girl! - The 40's alliance was - You know what this means, right? Now you are in charge. - You are one lucky person. Chandler, spin the wheel! 66. - Oh. - Right over there. - 43, I know it's a hard decision for you, but I'd like to stay. - Oh, that's gonna make me cry. - If you let her stay, she gets control. - Oh. - 66, you are so sweet and it's been a pleasure unfortunately in this game we're trying to stick together and I've enjoyed you but unfortunately you're eliminated. - Thank you, thank you everybody, it's okay. it's okay. - Thank you for coming out, 66. Oh, brutal. - I'm so proud of you. - With 42's influence over 43- - We gotta keep control or we'll be eliminated. - We're at war. - Nobody outside 57. - I mean, you don't even know 57. - 57 you're eliminated. - 40's, watch out for the 50's 'cause they'll come back after you. - 65. - Oh, that's me. - It's for the game and I'm sorry, you've also been eliminated. - Oh! - She just took 65 out of the game and I know it's breaking her heart, I know it is, but we cannot lose control. - 43 knows that if she and gives up control of the wheel, the next person could That's a big one. This means a lot to Gio. Don't take this decision lightly. - Is it, is that 11? - Gio, don't cry yet, it's not over. I want you to listen to me very carefully, the next few seconds determine a lot. I'm gonna hand you this mic and it's up to you to convince that person not to eliminate you. Do you understand? - You are a kind person and you are kind enough - Save Gio! - Save Gio! - Save Gio! Save Gio! - Oh, my gosh. - Don't do it. Now is not the time to - Okay. Gio, I admire you so much- - You are literally the coolest You've got tons of energy and spunk and your future is super bright, but unfortunately your time here is over. I'm so, so sorry. - All right. - Everyone was absolutely speechless. Everyone, round of applause. I felt so bad about this elimination that I actually had age 11 come up and help me on stage. Give it up for Gio. - At this point, everyone outside of the 40's knew they were in big trouble. - She's gonna eliminate everybody. - If you're not on 40, you're gone. - Once again, I don't think - 17. - 17, unfortunately you are eliminated. - Thanks. - The 16-year-old. - I have a great-grandmother, she's not doing too good health-wise. - I'm so sorry, but you're also eliminated, 16. - Ah, wow. - I am so proud of you, I'm so proud of you. - Believe it or not, for some reason the wheel just kept missing the 40's alliance. - 52. - You're eliminated. - Oh, my God. - Until this one, and now the hardest decision of the challenge. Are you gonna eliminate yourself? - I think I'm gonna keep spinning, Jimmy. - Okay, give us another spin. - You've also been eliminated. - Ooh. - Unfortunately you are eliminated. - All right, 75. - Brutal. - 62. - See ya, you ain't even gotta say nothing, bye. - 62, you don't even wanna at least try to convince her? - Nope, bye. - Hey 62, I just wanna let you know I'm gonna miss your snoring. - What did you say, villain? - I said I'm gonna miss your snoring. - I'm not mad at you. 43, no, I started feeling your pain, but you're just cruel. - I miss you already. - Bye, y'all. - Without even making 43 decide, 62 left her cube and with only one elimination left, let's see who their All right, it landed on Feastables, that means all of you get the world's best chocolate. - Milk Crunch, that's my favorite. - Oh, Crunch. Thank you, Jimmy. Even though he's eliminated, we'll still honor him. Make sure you go to Walmart and try our brand new formula. Anyways, when the wheel finally landed on someone else in the 40's alliance- - 41, I love you and that's why I'm - We finally have somebody new. Depending on who it lands on, this just might be our last spin. - All right, Mr 100, do you have anything to say to the person attempting to eliminate you? - I hope that you will not eliminate me and I ask you not to vote me out. - Mr. 100, I am so sorry, God bless you, I hope that everything works out for you. &lt;i&gt;Adios.&lt;/i&gt; - Oh, no. - I understand your response and I congratulate you on what you do. - Let's give it up for age 100. - Everyone was absolutely heartbroken to see our oldest contestant be eliminated and because he was I couldn't let him leave without something extra. I'll give you $20,000 for coming out and competing. - Thank you, I've enjoyed being with you. - It's been brutal, we just watch a lot of people get eliminated, I know everyone's probably - Specifically 43. - Eliminated, eliminated, eliminated, eliminated, eliminated. - We don't need to say specific numbers. - True. - How do you - I've lost the love for the 40's, I'll say it out loud, they decimated my group. - The 50's don't seem to like you guys. - 'Cause we knocked half of 'em out. If they had gotten the mic, they would've knocked half of us out. - I agree. - The moral of the story is trust no one. - And after letting the contestants recover for a few hours, we held another vote to see if they could decide on a winner. Looks like literally none of you can agree on anything. It's time for another challenge! It'll be intense. - Good. - If you look over here, you'll see $250,000, not to be confused with and one of you could walk out with this one right now. - What? - Oh, Lord. - But before I tell you how, we need to black out all your rooms, bring in the curtains! - He doesn't want us - Which is tough 'cause we're such a strong team, so- - That really antes up the stakes a bit. - We have officially If only one of you voluntarily step out and eliminate yourself, you win this $250,000, but if any more than one of you try to go for it, you'll be eliminated and win nothing. The timer has started, let's see if someone wins $250,000. - I literally missed this time I'm gonna get Just letting you know, I will be stepping out, so if you wanna join me, then we can be losers together! - I think I might do it. - 64, you going? - Well, if you go and 42 goes, you don't get nothing! - That's right! - It was abundantly clear that age 42 was going to do everything in his power to secure this challenge's prize money for himself, which means while they're deciding if they wanna step out of their cubes, I wanna tell you guys about &quot;Top Troops&quot;. &quot;Top Troops&quot; is a free to play mobile game where you battle enemies, conquer lands, and unlock new characters. - Are you in this game? - I haven't got to that talking point yet. - My bad. - With Top Troops, I can literally train my own army to fight in massive epic battles.

My decision was made - It looks like the going to forget the damage that they took yesterday. - All I gotta say, 40's, watch out for the '50's, 'cause they'll come back after you. - And thanks again to &quot;Top Troops&quot; for making this video possible, make sure to go download it after you finish the video. So far, 82 people have been eliminated from this challenge, but we're not slowing down anytime soon. Good morning, everybody, do you think you're all gonna agree on who should win the 250 grand? - Maybe. - Throw the votes up on the tablets, surely everyone voted for the same person. - Let's be honest, should I just get the - Yeah. - It's getting less unanimous as we have less people. All right, time for the next challenge, bring out the briefcases! At this point, all the began to pick up on what - There are cases with numbers on 'em, like &quot;Deal Or No Deal&quot;. - Oh my goodness, this is &quot;Deal Or No Deal&quot;, I think it. - It almost looks like Um... - Our next challenge looks really similar to the very popular show &quot;Deal Or No Deal&quot;, and so we brought out the Howie Mandel. - Oh wow! - Everyone over - Thank you, please. - 14-year-old, you might not have seen it. - Do you know me? - Wait, wait, wait, I might know some of, is it music, are you a music artist? - And if you're also under the age of 40 and haven't seen &quot;Deal Or No Deal&quot;, don't worry, I'll explain the rules along the way. If you look at those 18 half say eliminated and half say safe. I need you to pick a number. - 14? - Makes sense. Open this briefcase where no one else, including me, can see what's inside. Do you know what's inside? - Yes. - Who is the next youngest person here? - [41] I think it's me! - All right, now I'm going to steal 14's briefcase for herself or choose at random one of Let's see how well they're - Hey, what's in the case, Number 14? - It says safe. - I'll steal it from you. 41, open the case. - I love it, he's having such a good time. - No, I am, this is like I'm reminiscing. Open the case. - Safe! Wow. Why wouldn't he just lie and keep his safe case? That means everyone's odds just got worse. It's time to pick a new briefcase, what number will it be? - 13. - Lucky 13. - Onto our next age 43. what you got in your suitcase? - It says eliminated. - Ooh. - I- at this point I didn't even know if he was telling the truth or not. - 14, do you pinky swear - It says not safe. - Whoa, is this a strategy? - I think I'm gonna pick - 14, open your briefcase! - All right. - Eliminated. - Oh, 14. - I'm so sorry, buddy. - Also another person on your elimination list, it never ends with her. - See ya, buddy, you're the best. So, I wanted to be honest and I was and I got eliminated. I feel like what I did - There are 16 brief cases, pick your number. - I'm gonna go with lucky number three. - We don't even need a they're side by side. - We still have an alliance, you can trust me or not. If you are safe, I'm gonna let you keep your briefcase. Are you safe? - I am not safe. - Ah, now I have to No steal. He chose not to steal 43's briefcase. Open it up for us. If she is lying and this case does in fact say safe, the 40's will not be able to and their alliance will be broken. - Oh! - That is a strong alliance, I'm so sorry, 43. - We love you, 43! - This is almost worse than being buried. - It's definitely worse. 15 cases are left and only eight of them are safe. - I'm going to tell you - I'm just gonna go with the fates. 44, he is eliminated. - This is brutal. - Good luck, man. - Pick whatever number you want. - 10. - 10. - I didn't walk in here with money, I walked in here with integrity, it's says safe. - Are you telling the truth? - You are making the - Whoa, he adds suspense. steal or no steal? - I'm gonna take it. - There's no turning back, your future lies inside this case. - I can't, ah. - Open the case. - Oh! She was telling the truth. - Thank you so much. - Let's see if at some point she decides to move on herself. - No. - What do you want him - Eliminated. - I'm gonna believe you and let you keep your case then. - Open the case. - While her honesty did in fact get her eliminated, it did save two of the people in her alliance. - Are you honest, 48? - I've always been honest with you, 51, you know that. I'm gonna make it easy for you, it says eliminated. - Howie, I got this one. Steal or no steal? - I love that! - Anyways, quarter mill on the line, 51? - I am going to not steal. - Let's see if 48 was telling the truth. Three, two, one! - He was lying! Well played, that was well played! - I hope you all learned. - That's how you lie, folks. - You made it to the top nine, let's see if 51 does, as well. 17, Howie, here we go, 17 is coming up. - I'm gonna trust whatever he says. - It says eliminated. - Steal or no steal? - No steal. - No steal, all right, let's show her. - He was honest. - 51, you're now eliminated. - That sucked. - Even though 54 just dodged a bullet, she's now faced with an elimination. - Hi 54, I am ready. - I'm honestly gonna tell you that in box number seven, it says eliminated. - I know you are giving because you won't lie to me. - This is a tough decision, steal or no steal? - And now I feel like sitting on my shoulders right now. Um, ah, steal. - All right. - Even though she said it has eliminate, you're gonna steal it? - That that is what I said, yes, steal. - He's jumping - Do you believe her? - Uh, I do, I want the best for her. I mean, I'll see my grandchildren. - Oh, my gosh. Wow, that might be the most selfless thing I've ever witnessed in my life. - I feel like I'm gonna You gave me the easiest - God will bless you. - You have a chance to give something, give that to that person and I did win, I met Howie Mandel. - And when faced with she chose honesty a second time. - I'm just gonna tell you - No, I'm not gonna steal it. - As the game neared it's end, we were running out of safe briefcases. - I got one of the safe boxes. - I'd like to steal, I believe him. What? - Oh. - Oh, no! - And once we got to the we had no idea if they were going to lie or tell the truth. It's between 67 and 96, one is safe and one is eliminate. Do you wanna pick the briefcase or do you want 96 to pick the briefcase? - Go for it, 96. - It's amazing that you're here, I hope I have the energy - And I wanna downhill ski next year. - Okay. Which case do you want? - 16. - We're gonna so nobody else can see it. - What's in the case, 96? - Eliminate. - My dad is 96 years old, he done told a whole lotta lies. - Do you want to or steal 96's case? - No steal. - And because these are we're gonna take the drama up a notch and open them both at the same time to see who's moving on. Top nine for $250,000, I'm gonna give us a countdown, three, two, one. - You're staying. We're staying! - The 96-year-old lied. - I'm alive and kicking. - That is why he's the oldest person left in this challenge. - And with that, we are now down to the top nine. The next challenge will be even crazier. - It's end game, we're down to the final nine. I am planning on winning this game. - Super nervous. - 40's alliance holding strong, woo! - Emotions are running high, I think it's gonna get pretty crazy soon. - And as we rolled into the contestants trust for each other was running thin. - Welcome to my humble abode. - Around you is - A sea of blood. - Do you trust those people - No, I don't. - Out of every single - Okay? - 47, 100%. When we got into this &quot;Let's see how far the two of us can get&quot;, and if it ends up being that would be amazing. - What's your strategy? - I don't have a strategy. - Since you cannot agree on who wins that giant you are now going to choose four people to eliminate from this competition. The way that you'll decide is simple, all of you will tell the room why you think you deserve the prize money, and as a group you'll have to decide whose story is worthy and not worthy for continuing this challenge. Every decision you have leads to this moment. Let 'em know what you'll - I've got a son who's got pretty significant special needs. - We leave everything back - I have no health insurance, I have horrific neuropathy. - My cousin, she has lupus, so I wanna help her, she has three little ones. - This is so hard, y'all, I also have an autistic, who will be seven at the end of the month, she needs so much work and we've got so far to go. - No, I'm crying for everybody, it breaks my heart. Just wanna give all my - How can we possibly rank somebody's wishes and hopes higher than anyone else's? - Invest the money for 90 to 120 days on my mining platform. - It's so unfair to say, &quot;Well, your charity's not as important as this or that&quot;, it doesn't seem fair. - Almost lost his business - We'll vote one at a time - Okay. let's start with the obvious. - I wanna give it to my daughter 'cause I'm living with her. She took me in when I could not- - This is getting harder and harder the longer it goes. Let's make our decision to move on because it's not getting any easier. - Now that you've heard and now it is up to all of you to decide who will stay and who will go. - I dunno what to do. - The people on this side of the room have decided on 61. - After hearing everybody's stories, it's time to see who should go home. Reveal the results. Wow. - Who was it? - That's me. - She's a troublemaker, you know what, so long, goodbye. - Three more competitors it is up to you to decide. - I don't know what I'm gonna do. - We can do 46 if we need to. Do it now. - 46, he wasn't very convincing with much. - The votes are in, all right. - Nervous? - Extremely, I'm about to knife my alliance. - You voted, let's see the results. Every vote was on a 40-year-old. I thought you all had an alliance? - Bro. - Whoa, all right. 46, you have been eliminated. - I cannot believe that just happened, the entire 40 year old's - Who's next? 96. - I can't do this anymore. - Let's see what you all decided.
