Hey, it's me, Destin. This is the 300th episode, which is cool. Thank you so much for watching. I was on the internet the other day. I was just scrolling on my phone. I was probably wasting too much time. But I came across this amazing It's a motor that appears And I'm a mechanical engineer. When I saw this thing, That's a spinny thing It has an axel of some sort, and it is moving. Furthermore, this one, can reverse directions, which is amazing. So I thought I've got to get to the bottom for a biomechanical motor are insane. Now, specifically, the thing this is You may have heard of the flagellum That's what this is. A flagellum is that whipy thing that helps provide locomotion. But I've never thought about that thing to have a shaft it rotates around. It's just the implications are wild. So the more I got to reading about this the more I realized this is a really big and things like that, but in philosophy. The complexity of a flagellar motor about the origin of life. And I'm not going to answer that in this that people are debating, and they're It's so complex. Well, You don't understand the time All this is fascinating. So I just wanted to see it. So to get to the bottom of how this thing I decided to go to the researchers a guy at Vanderbilt University. So I'm a Smarter Every Day. I did this about a month ago. Just got in the car, drove to Vanderbilt, about a flagellar motor. Let's go get Smarter Every Day. So I bobbed and weaved my way across got to the School of Pharmacology Yeah, doing well. How are you? Prashant is a Senior Research Associate Just to give us whole context here, with your team in Nature... What was the- [P] Microbiology. [D] Nature Microbiology. It's about a motor that's made Yes. Okay, can you show me where [P] Sure. If You see on the screen here, The bacteria has two membranes. These two membranes protects the bacteria [D] We're talking about the outer [P] Outer shell of the bacteria. [P] If you see here, there will be The two Now, zoom into that. [D] Okay, so it's almost like a submarine. Forgive me, Prashant. I'm going to say a bunch of engineering [P] I understand. [D] It feels like a submarine with the outer [P] That's correct. [D] Was he really? [P] Yeah, he was an Indian Navy [D] So this bacteria, in my head, [P] Yes. And is this the propeller [P] That is correct. This is the propeller Now, this submarine It doesn't have a rudder, but it uses So what we see here, and there's proton filled in here. [D] Did you say proton? [P] Yeah, it's filled with protons, [D] Oh, hydrogen ions. [P] The hydrogen ions in here filled, there's very little hydrogen ion. There's a It's a gradient. We have to go slow for me. When you say proton, you're meaning [P] Yes, just a proton. It's a hydrogen ion. This is high concentration of protons of proton in the inside of the bacteria. Now, protons, for example, there's a dam, there's less water, there's a gradient, or it could be used, that potential [D] There's a potential difference [P] Yes. That's the gradient that this What happens is, if you see here, is connected to a motor system. [D] How does it know when [P] There are sensors on the Once it knows that there's a threat or it senses that it gets a chemical signal, of signals that go through. One of the protein well known for this The moment it senses that I need to run to a different location, and it encourages the motor [D] Okay, said because you just created You put sensors on the Well, it already exists. Okay, there are sensors Somehow the bacteria knows where a sensor is triggered and it knows how to trigger what motor [P] Yes, and how to turn it. [P] Which direction. So that particular protein it This is clockwise direction. When it is not attached to it, The default motion is counterclockwise. When the motor turns counterclockwise- [D] You say counterclockwise [P] From this direction. [P] From the outside, yeah. [P] Yeah. And when the motor is running the bacteria will swim forward. So it's just the board goes straight. [D] And that has to do with the shape of... If I were to design this, with the shape of the impeller. [P] Yes. The way the flagella is So when it starts rotating, it thrusts, and it moves it forward. Now, you would think that it would also do in the opposite direction, right? [P] Now, what happens is when it's going multiple flagellas on the bacteria body. All of them start forming a bundle, propeller and pushes this straight Now, when it has to sense it like there's I need to reanalyze my situation gradient, on and test it again, it turns clockwise. When it does that, the bundle opens up. When they open up, the bacteria starts stumbling all around. It no longer has a certain... There's got to be a word [P] Yeah, chemotaxis. Exactly. We call this whole process It's a chemical signal that allows from one place to another. Everything happens in milliseconds. There are some videos that show bacteria and it's just like crashing. It's a biased, random walk. Researchers have done this experiment. There's a petri dish, and put bacteria on the edges of it. You would think the bacteria would go a little bit straight, direction, realizes, Oh, That, as a person, you think random. [D] I'm getting emotional now because there's and it has what we call And so what we do is we take the fins and we dither them. And then all we do is we bias We go... So it's constantly moving, bit in order to make a movement. And so what took us a long time This molecule or this bacteria It has sensors. It has actuators. [D] And it has feedback. And I'm getting emotional. Because It's a neat [P] It is. Over the years, this design It just takes some time, It doesn't have eyes like we do. It figures out by sensing [D] It's an emergent behavior Emergent behavior? [P] Yeah, that's a good term. [D] The structure of this motor, In all of research, [P] They have seen a low Basically, if I blur this up, They have known it looks like this blob. There's a ring at the bottom, But what we have is a high-resolution each and every amino acid. [D] I noticed on your video, it's almost [P] Yes, that small gear is MOT-AB. That is what the proton comes through, [D] Prash explained that the MOT-AB, pump, is able to interact with this band and that has the ability to pivot 180 the motor to change directions. So in your animation, Is it literally Is that really one [P] It can employ more if It's two, three, four, five, Up to 11 is what we see can fit on there, But we don't know the exact But it is a sequential increase [D] Okay, so I'm going to get If you have a torque, So So that little pinion, What did you call it? Mot AB? [D] Mot AB. [D] So Mot AB is this little [P] Yes. [D] Is it pinned to the sidewall or something? [P] It's also in this inner membrane. So it's right here. So there's multiple colors that you see, This all is one Mot AB. And it takes protons or hydrogen ions into the low gradient here. And as it's doing it, it makes And this rotates, and it [D] Okay, but it's pinned in that wall. [P] Yes, it is pinned in this membrane, and it can shift a little bit in and out. Mot-ab is only turning in one direction. It cannot go in two directions. Here, the energy is only So how does this motor And that does because the MOT-AB, in the other direction, pulls the MOT-AB with it, and then It's churning in the same way, to go in the other direction. [D] It's like shifting into reverse [P] Yeah, it's almost like back It reminds me of my there's copper coils that he's making, motors and putting fresh copper coils. It reminds me of that structure. [D] Because your grandfather was [P] Electrical Engineer. He used to build and rebuild [D] Is it fun to know that you're working [P] Yes, it is. It feels very rewarding that my grandfather worked in the past. Obviously not the same scale, But just to know that I'm It's rewarding. I love this. We're going to go back and talk to Prash got these images of the motor. But to get more context, to Dr. Tina Iverson, who runs this lab. She's the PI or This is Dr. Iverson, [T] This is my lab. [D] So congratulations That's a big deal. [T] So we are looking at really this nuts how they can move toward something and how they can move away from something Bacteria are moving toward a food [D] Okay. [T] And metabolism is like It's how you bring But we're asking that question at a larger but for human cells. How does metabolism affect what our cells their self- fate. And so we were trying to understand just metabolism change what cells do? [D] I feel like every time we as humans have We make big discoveries. [D] Do you feel that? I think that one of the ways the entire ability to image but medium and larger things in the cell Some of the new technologies are now proteins at finer details. [D] So we're seeing the overall system. So before we were putting the system and now we're seeing the system And these bridges between the molecules tell us a lot about how they work. But molecules together working in concert [D] So we've got this motor that for the first down to the protein level. The question is, how do we get that image? How is Prash able to see this motor in a way we haven't been able To answer this question, where they use a series of cryo-electron to understand how they work. He introduced me to Miriam and Scott, So now we're with Scott and Miriam, Am I saying that correctly? [M] Yeah. Yeah. [S] Absolutely. So all of our sample goes onto a grid It's a mesh work on there. [M] Copper. So they can make it made There's some other materials that we Most of them are copper. [M] You have whatever sample It will get plunge frozen. You literally just drop it in, ethane and just gets flash frozen. So your sample is in vitreous ice. [S] We're just making a network that can hold with protein trapped in it. [M] So that's what you start off with. And then after plunging, Cartridge. [S] Our middle room here is So we'll walk in and look at it. This is our screening microscope. [D] So this is like a quick look. [S] It's a quick look. We have a source at the top the way through the column, and a detector at the bottom. [D] So you're shooting through it? We are going all the way [D] The process that the scientists use to get and I'm going to take a crack sophisticated animation style. So behold, markers and paper. All right, so there's two You've got Salmonella and E. Now, Salmonella, that's where That's these little So that's the flagellum, Ecoli, a different bacteria, make things if you tell it what to do. So So this process is So basically, I just took that motor off, into the factory in Ecoli. I'm going to put the instructions Ecoli is not the only type of cell but this is the one that the scientists This is called transformation. This little factory goes to work, right? It makes a bunch of these little motors, that has all these little The act of creating this We are now going to take all of these called purification. We're going to pop this and we're going to basically dump all of the stuff that's We're going to flash freeze it. And then after that, kVA microscope and We're going to go to look at the grid. Now, when we look at the grid, So this is like a course We're going to go through and we're going there's one right there. Over here. And then you're going to go all the way in and see which one has motors in it. How many motors does it have? You're then going to move it over to the And that's where we're really So what they do is they zoom in, frames of each individual little motor. The reason they have to do that is because type level, like the atomic level. Things shake a little So you have to take 50 images in order to make sure you take out that dithering. So at that point, you then Now, that structure at that point, it could be like this, it could be And Prash is going to tell us what Before we talk to Prash, and how the scientists do all this, on a video on the second channel, Go check that out if you want So you get the images from the microscope. [P] So when you get the images from the [D] And I can see the little Is that the bottom of a motor? [P] Yeah, this is the bottom. This is the top view. So I would say that this is how it looks. This motor right here Then this view right here is We click on all of these particles, by hand and using the computer. We run a program of 2D classification, particles that has been picked so far are put together into classes. What we see here is some are just junks, our protein complexes. [D] You go through there and you pick [P] Yes, exactly. This looks like a good stuff. This is a good complex. This is good, this is good, We don't select those, together into a program We have 2D classes. Once we have 2D classes, we put them [D] Oh, so you build a 3D model. You make these shapes actually match up. Each of those classes on pictures that we to which one is the top view, and program starts doing matching those good job at doing that. [D] It's really the ability That's the secret sauce. You have the transformation, to replicate, and then Ecoli expresses it. That's expression and then purification. Transformation, expression, [P] Once we get the 3D model, We can see all sides. Now what we see is a low-resolution model. We try to collect all the good signals come up with a high-resolution structure. What you see here is an 8 angstrom. From here, 8 angstrom to 4 angstrom, to get there, 2-3 weeks. [D] You're removing bad data [P] Get to the high resolution. [D] Then once you get to the high resolution, and mapping the proteins. To get this map, the puzzle pieces in, what amino acid goes in which place. So since we know the sequence We just have to fit it [D] So we have these 2D images that we wrapped And at this point, which are made up of amino acids. And so the question I had is, And it's my understanding that biochemists amino acids are shaped in certain ways, So it's like a puzzle piece, So they're like, oh, here's blobafil, I don't know these words, pieces in on the computer, looks like, which is incredible. [P] So if you see this curve, [D] The coil. This coil, now we know alpha helix, orientation or sequence So this prior information So if you see now, We can fill [D] This is a shape a biochemist person [P] No, that's very common. It's commonly found in almost Not every protein, [D] It's intimidating to me, hah looks like a bunch of squiggles. Yeah, but this is normal. [D] This is easily interpretable data. [D] Did you map these by hand Is that what just happened? Or did you tell the computer [P] No, we mapped this. Our previous researchers We use the information as like, Let's use that and see If it does, it's good. [D] Wow. It can take weeks to months sometimes, [D] But you like it? This is the best part. This is where we get answers. This is what we have been Even when we are driving What will I find today? So now we come back and sit down, So for example, I can go here and be like, any bonds being formed. I go, Turn on the distances and angle. So there's a definite interaction Maybe that is what's stabilizing They're forming some bond So this is what gets us excited that we happening in this complex, And if we disrupt this, this can This can disrupt the connection it's having with other proteins. [D] Once you disrupt this motor, if you could stabilize it, whatever, then you could start to do things [P] Yes, bacterial chemotaxis. [D] You could disrupt the ability for the [P] Yeah, exactly. For infection, stopping the bacteria is but not with an antibiotic, because This is one of the many other options [D] Maybe you get to invent a new word. Instead of an antibiotic, [both laughing] You get to slow them down. [D] Thank you very much. [D] So the flagellar motor exists, It's complex, and it reminds me I love this thing, There are implications for the fact so integral to the creation of human life. I mean, this is fascinating stuff. So it also opens up a huge debate. People say, well, how can something The logic goes like this. If this motor system is composed and all these parts work together of rotating, then how did Did it all have to happen Or is there some evolutionary advantage intermediate stage of development? Is 15% of this motor What function would 50% What were the steps these components took molecular machine in the first place? Scientists are trying to figure this out, Many seem to be focusing on the Type 3 which works like a hypodermic needle that This device looks similar, but it's The complexity and origin of the bacterial interesting conundrum. As I was a younger man, find people saying, Hey, People say, Hey, you got There's a big war going on. It's between science and faith. You're either in one camp or the other. Get your flag and figure out where And the more I have matured and started my flag is, the more I've been able matter where they are. There's a really interesting I can't speak for everything in the book. It's called Where It talks about this interplay between It's very interesting. It goes more into the areas of philosophy, and it's fantastic. So this is what I would encourage you. If you have your flag in a camp somewhere, to not defend a flag. I would encourage you to look and just think about it It's a fantastic thing to think about. You have intelligence And I love that about consciousness. And so for me, I feel joy. You know how when you go outside at night and you see all these stars and you feel that's what this makes me feel like, I feel awe and reverence And as a Christian, this makes me I feel compelled with gratitude So that's just where I'm at. But what I would encourage you You have a brain. Just think about how things are. And I hope you are very happy this, no matter what you think about it. So anyway, enough about that. I want to say thank you to everybody that You'll notice there's not I just wanted to make this for you, to everybody that supports at You're smart. I'm just going around asking questions, So this is the 300th episode. So thank you for supporting Smarter And I would encourage you, to consider supporting at to let me keep doing it. And if that's not your thing, fun and I'm grateful to all of you. I am Destin. If you'd like to learn more about the deep I'll have a video on the second channel how all this works, but I love it. Big thanks to everybody at Vanderbilt I'm Destin. Have a good one.
