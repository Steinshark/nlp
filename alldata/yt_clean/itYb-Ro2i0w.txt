Welcome to Sad Boyz, and other things also. I'm Jordan. And today, we're joined a commentary queen, a R&amp;B recording artist, - um, and a pet owner. - [JARVIS] Kennie JD. It's the only one where [JORDAN] &quot;What? I am?&quot; Everything else is just a fluke - &quot;YouTube?&quot; I'm good. I'm good. What do you see - are you seeing - Yeah. &quot;I'm a YouTuber.&quot; It's one of the things that I, like, kinda awkwardly have to admit to, like on dating apps and stuff. &quot;Hey, what kinda videos do you make?&quot; [JORDAN] Do you ever get one of those? Um, yeah. Well, now it's just like movie reviews and stuff now, - [JORDAN] That's nice and concise. - [JARVIS] Yeah. Right. &quot;I'm a digital media specialist.&quot; [KENNIE] Ay. &quot;You know, That's kind of, like, innocuous now, &quot;I work for a media company, - Marketing was a big one. - But now I'm like, &quot;Yeah, I do YouTube.&quot; When I only did podcasts, - &quot;What kinda stuff do you make?&quot; - I was like, &quot;Me saying shit.&quot; I love lying on dating apps. Yeah. I sometimes still, like, pretend I work in tech. - It's the safest option. - In a way. Yeah. I just feel like it's a lie keep going. I'm sure I could and they would have no clue There's no follow-up questions If you say, &quot;I work in tech&quot; and I'm like - which I used to do - - And they're like, &quot;That's great.&quot; Yeah. They're like, &quot;I don't know enough &quot;That's awesome. I'm here.&quot; It sucks when you date someone 'cause I'm like, &quot;Yeah. Yeah.&quot; Oh, dude, exclusively in San Francisco - Oh, yeah. I like the enthusiasm more so Like, &quot;Go. Go, you.&quot; - Love it. You know what? Can we say Hey, man, one of my reiki healer-slash-marketing consultant - That was fire. in one of our Patreon episodes, Patreon.com/SadBoyz. Yeah. Snakes only. - [JORDAN] That was a cool date. - That was a good lead-in. I was a student. Oh, OK. So, you just went straight - So, I started my channel - [JARVIS] OK. but I didn't do it full time - Yeah, we're young as fuck as well. - I think we're all... yeah. - I'm 28. - Jordan's 16. - Sorry. - Can you stop swearing? When's your birthday? I'm 28 too. January 9th. - Whoa. I can tell by your eyebrows - Fuck. - I'm not even gonna ask a follow-up. Can you tell by my eyebrows - No. we do, me and him? - [KENNIE] Same year, too? - [KENNIE] Oh. - I'm the elder statesman. I'm the youthful, exuberant one. - You're exuberant. I'm the guy. Tell you what the youfs is into these days. - (Jarvis groans) - The clock app. Yeah, the clock app. Man, I remember You guys fuck with musical.ly? Oh, man. I remember... I was at Patreon when because we were talking about musical.ly, - Mm. the post-Vine, but then it was like, that are dancing and lip-syncing, - [JORDAN] &quot;What?&quot; And then it was like the company Wait, what was it? They bought musical.ly and they merged the apps, 'cause TikTok wasn't like - But then it was merged... - With musical.ly. And I know this because I also was, um... Back when I was in tech, I was like reverse-engineering APIs, and I remember looking at TikTok's requests that they and they were hitting musical.ly endpoints. That is gonna mean something - And to circle back, the enthusiasm. - I didn't understand a word. Well, something you do - is bad movies. And reality TV. I noticed - I was watching your to see if we had exactly the same takes, - [JARVIS] which we basically did. - Which means you're correct. The consensus was Didn't you think Kwame was - I did think Kwame was decent. Well, that was a prediction - [KENNIE] Fair. he is the most unenthusiastic Um, 'cause he would - OK. So, there's this guy, I'll just say I'm the avatar for people I just haven't got 'round to it. So, feel free to direct I think if we were to, like, - of this season, it's, um... Well, how about you provide a theme; Charitably, second chances. Oh, second chances is interesting. For me, it was triangles. Love triangles. - Fair. OK, well... - It's the same idea. because there's a lot more love triangles One is, like, the way that someone It's like, &quot;It's not bad, but... different.&quot; Mmhmm. Yeah. I think anybody who gets feedback &quot;Um, I appreciate the project &quot;Your output was extremely mid this year.&quot; &quot;I was looking at your slide deck on the and it was extremely based.&quot; - &quot;So I wanted to congratulate you.&quot; &quot;Mmhmm. For sure. Certainly. No cap.&quot; &quot;Do you intend on being quirked up in Q3?&quot; - That's what the Q is for. - We're young. We're so young, dude. I literally was hitting Yeah. I was actually doing the jerk. - I was jerking. Didn't they bring it back - Uh, they did, yeah. Oh, wait. Do you remember when but it was a completely different thing? - [JORDAN] No. When? Because - OK. I didn't get my, like, - No. &quot;They're bringing back the Harlem Shake.&quot; No, but that's - I feel like the - like culture vulture-fied. Because when I was young... - in the Stone Age... I felt like the Harlem that you would see, like, Lil' Romeo do - in, like, a music video. - You know, like one of these. I'm sorta doing it in slow motion, - just to pantomime what the - Yeah. For the audio-only li - lo - losers, But then in like 2015 or something, the Harlem Shake became something - Yes. People would be, like, dancing normally, and then there would be a cut and then everybody would be, like, I believe it was a Joji bit that blew up, pre-doing Joji as a musician, [JARVIS &amp; KENNIE] Ohhhh. It was like a viral Joji... Yeah. [KENNIE] &quot;Shut the fuck up&quot; times Joji, - Interesting. Yeah, 'cause it was weird. I was just - People were saying and I was like, Oh, wait. Are you talking about that weird, like, coke-driven fever dream of everyone doing, &quot;Do the Harlem Shake?&quot; - (vocalizing) Cut to black. Cut back in. You're in, like, a Pickle Rick I was in, uh, high school, so I think it wasn't as recent - [JARVIS] Oh, yeah, it's - So... I... I guess there's gonna be a drop? Yes. I don't even think they change costumes. Yeah. So, this is not what I recall as the Harlem Shake. What's the view count on that? - 'Cause it's not. Where are the, like, baggy white tees? Yeah. &quot;Learn Hip Hop - Let's watch MahaloDance. [MAHALODANCE] ...the Harlem Shake. - [KENNIE] I've never seen a tutorial. I love it. I can't believe I've found myself here. &quot;Welcome to how to dance.&quot; -'Cause everything else... MahaloDance. His name is Professor Lock, and we're gonna respect him OK, I'm sorry. Dr. Lock. He has resting angry face. Excuse me, can I just say, he's - Oh, yeah. - That's on his LinkedIn. - He's tenured. I was hoping - when I clicked this, I was hoping that he would at the very beginning [MAHALODANCE] Da-da-boom, da-da-boom, da-da-boom. OK, yeah. No, this is the Harlem Shake. - OK. So, steady feet, wiggling hips, shoulders. - Yeah. I think we need to triple-time it, though. Well, he's a dance teacher. - He's getting there. This is the director of - I do not know what to tell you. [MAHALODANCE] Here we go. - [JARVIS] Yeah. This is the Harlem Shake. - How old is this video? All right. Well, it's close. I was in high school... - No, but this is the - - The actual Harlem Shake I could... - Yeah. I was watching, like - I'm not even joking, - [KENNIE] Yeah. - Oh, yeah. - He was like 6. Presumably, that beat just caught on, and then that video was, like, blown up by Pink Guy. It's the infinite resurgence of, like, - Yeah. - yesteryear. Yeah. Well, the Pink Guy thing... &quot;From yesteryear.&quot; (Cockney accent) Remember the Harlem Shake. Oh, milord. Back in my day, we were I remember on the fields during harvest, when it was musical.ly. (all laughing) (normal accent) Hey, come on, now. Oh, that's fun. Good times. &quot;2019 and this...&quot; Well, I don't know how we got here. We were talking about Love is Blind. Speaking of Shake, Shake from Love is Blind was a bad guy. - Two seasons ago, yes. - But we were talking about Kwame. Um, and he is a man who is a former - [KENNIE] Yes. - Tech marketing-type thing? - Partnerships. I disliked him immediately, though. Yeah, you had the read. Um, I think because I just have an aversion every word they say is a presentation. - He does give that vibe. Well, you know... Even with tech people and, like, I think... - Hate 'em. Get rid of 'em. - They suck. I went to Michigan, so there was a lot of tech people um, in the area. - For college, or you just went? - Oh. &quot;I drove through Michigan and saw - Like, U of M's essentially a cult. So, they're kinda everywhere. But you kinda, uh, learn about - the type of tech person - at U of M. And they're generally nice. They complain about not There's not a lot of conversation It's that and, like, jiu-jitsu. It's just them speaking in, like, - fucking Morse code or something. And they're like, And then god forbid you say, &quot;What did you have a rough week with?! - Writing papers?&quot; &quot;Did you start a start-up like me?&quot; - &quot;I was actually doing a hackathon.&quot; - Oh, yeah. &quot;I was driving my RC car.&quot; And that man was Elon Musk. Um... - That does happen. I remember back when I was in school there was a bit of, like, a constant... - [KENNIE] Pissing contest. Yeah. &quot;You're not grinding hard enough.&quot; - Yeah. Results is not the thing you review; - Productivity porn. Like, &quot;I haven't slept in 4 years.&quot; Well, I remember... That's such an embarrassing - [KENNIE] It is. self-control and routine, And, like, you sound like - Yeah. - Inherently. &quot;Cool, man. Improve yourself.&quot; &quot;Still improve that for me.&quot; - &quot;Change.&quot; - Yeah. - [KENNIE] No. - [KENNIE] Ah. - [KENNIE] Naturally. - If you can believe it. He's also a cofounder of this, like, defense contractor called Palantir. Um, but he is most known for being one of pulling strings behind the scenes - [KENNIE] Mm. Ah. bankrupted Gawker Media because of that, uh, Hulk Hogan - sex tape scandal. - [KENNIE] Ohhhh. because he had a vendetta against Gawker for outing him, I think, because he's a gay man Gawker article about that. Now, I'm not here to cast judgment but Peter Thiel has done a lot of Um, but he is a product - Mm. We're talking about the, um, the glorification of &quot;I didn't - Mm. back when I was in college, or maybe freshly out of college, where he would give students, promising students and founders and stuff, like $100k to drop out of school and start a company. And I think there were maybe 20 of them, or something like that. That could almost pay off the loan. And they all, like, lived in a house together. - Oh. - but it wasn't being filmed. And I was just hearing stories living in closets and shit like that because they were just trying - Oh, yeah. self-preservation or... Or, like... I don't even know. Their brains don't work 'cause they're Yeah, and it's all about I'm like, &quot;You need to Yeah. Disrupting the way you're being. Yeah. Disrupt the toothbrush. By using it. Yeah. It vibrates. It's disrupting itself. Um, but I just remember that as being the peak, in my mind, of that culture, because it was truly seen as a... Glorification. It was like everybody who was doing that luminary as like a 19-, 20-year-old. I think you had to be What did you do in college? I double-majored, uh... International politics, - and a Korean studies major. Wait, so, that first thing - but it was one major? International studies, Oh, I see. I see. Ah, you should have got If you're doing that, they should have They gave me two. - Yo. - OK, hold on. Stop flexing on us. - [JARVIS] I simply have one. It's just a big computer degree, yeah. Yeah, OK, well, come back - [KENNIE] Really? Ever seen Cesky sen? (laughs) - It's fine. I guess we'll eventually - Yesterday I went to see Beau is Afraid. I saw you tweet about it; I'm gonna cuss my I love him. I love him to pieces. He's, like, a big - He likes the weirdest shit in film, - so he was like, &quot;It's a masterpiece.&quot; Oh, yeah. He's a A24, Similar fetishization, honestly, - on the film media side as there is for Peter Thiel started his own - bizarre political party and stuff. It's 3 hours. - [JARVIS &amp; JORDAN] Oh. so it can go here. I can't. I can't make a video on it. It's a fever dream. I don't even think calling it a movie is appropriate. - [JARVIS] Ooh. OK. It's like taking you through a voyage of one man's irrational anxiety. There's a penis monster somewhere towards the latter, like, 10%. I've always wanted to understand - Yeah. - I'd like to pay money for the experience. - I couldn't imagine.&quot; For 3 hours. Is this gonna be one of annoying male film students are like, - &quot;This is the peak of cinema&quot;? Before seeing it, because - My manager's name is Cole. Um, he texted me; he was like, And I'm like, &quot;You're gonna He was like, &quot;They're doing And then like the next day, - who probably went to the same screening. And he was like - I will read it off, because it's the most beautifully-written tweet that I've ever seen, um, and it made me wanna - and it made me wanna I've only seen the most extreme takes - Mmhmm. - [JARVIS] Yeah. Hereditary and/or Midsommar? I love Midsommar more, but I did like Hereditary. - I haven't seen either of them. - I'm bad at watching movies. uncomfortable in a way that wasn't, like, evocative. - Mm. different movies have - Right. Midsommar made me feel like someone - and I just didn't wanna watch it. Hereditary I loved, I watched it, like, - like 2 years ago, maybe. Where is it? I really need to stop tweeting so much. A lot of pretty messed-up stuff What? Yeah, &quot;Mr. Thiel, please give me $100,000.&quot; Yeah, we have a &quot;cancel corner&quot; where - It's a gotcha podcast. - Speaking of my anxiety personified. - [JARVIS] It's a Twitter monster. Yeah, it's an entire segment It's like Hot Ones, except for it's all your, Yeah, we searched certain Because I'm very fast and loose if you haven't noticed. Oh, here it is. I went past it. So, like, and I'd be like, &quot;I probably said it. We just made up the tweets. I've tweeted things that I don't remember. Uh, quote - this is from @thenoisefm. &quot;Just left a screening of Beau is Afraid.&quot; &quot;Before credits started rolling, stood up and yelled, 'I better not hear a single fucking person clap.'&quot; &quot;Another dude screamed, &quot;A girl yelled, 'A total piece of shit.'&quot; [JORDAN] At the same screening? These were all people - Wow. on another group that said, 'A24 should be dissolved as a company' and called it 'a career-killer' for Aster.&quot; I don't think it's a career-killer. - Yeah, I suppose. Again, if we're gonna We dubbed that. You said - Yeah. - is what we'll do. - [KENNIE] Yes. - &quot;the worst thing I've ever seen.&quot; I will give him this: technically, it's an incredibly-made film. I thought you were gonna - Well... arguably. [JARVIS] Yeah. Like, I paid like $18 to see. Why is [JARVIS] Oh, it's so expensive. I was like, &quot;Maybe I We were just in Florida, and I was reminded of how cheap everything can be. It's the first time I've ever super trite, like, &quot;People will but they won't get Twitter Blue?&quot; - [JORDAN] I don't want Twitter Blue, - [JORDAN] but god, I wish I spent less. Oh, dude, but you're broke, actually. No, but I was never verified either way. - How do I know you're the real one? I'm gonna use some tech talk again to say - Here's how they verified it. - 0100... - [JORDAN] You start beating him up. query users or something, and there's... When you get the, um, information back from the API, there's a bunch of information and you can tell whether or not they're a Twitter Blue subscriber. And so they did this throughout, And they were able to find that on the day that legacy there were a net 28 Twitter Blue sign-ups. - Which is a wild number. I don't - like, I still - I think that this manner of verifying things could be fraught and could be incorrect, but I choose to believe that only 28 people, To make - if it were 100 times that, I think that it also came up to, like, there's 19,000 or something Twitter Blue subscribers, - which is a very small number. Considering how much [KENNIE] Yes. Considering how many users I saw a tweet that made me smile. It was like, &quot;Elon Musk and he forgot to mute, and you could just hear him softly crying.&quot; And I was like, &quot;What little justice.&quot; Crying in white South African, (soft honking). That sounds French. - I'm rolling through every accent. (French accent) I can't believe it. In Jordan's world, everyone (as Musk, but French) Why won't you My father owned a stake in a emerald mine. - I can't do it. (as Musk) I can't believe you've - (as Musk) No, sorry, I'm not. Did you see that, where he was like - started trying to say his dad had an emerald mine - and there was no evidence of it? Yeah, 'cause he has a thing that, in interviews he would reference. But then more recently, he was like, &quot;Actually, this is false.&quot; And then not only on Twitter did they have the, uh, community context added, where it was like, &quot;In 2014, he said this in an interview,&quot; but he said that he would give someone $1 million in bitcoin - or sorry, no. A million Dogecoin, I think is what was said. I don't know if it was $1 million - which is probably like 35 cents. [JARVIS] Yeah. Um, but if they could prove that this existed. And then Errol Musk, Elon's father, said, &quot;Hey, can I make that money?&quot; &quot;Because I can prove that 'cause I owned it.&quot; And then it was like, &quot;Yeah, like, Elon's siblings have pendants and shit, and Elon saw the emeralds at our home growing up, and I don't know why he's And before you write the comment, owning any stake in an emerald mine is equivalent to that. - Yeah. That is benefiting from - at all. I've never done any of it, so I actually haven't even No, but it wasn't even like... People weren't even trying to say right, in owning this mine? They were trying to say that, like, had an immense privilege and it was kinda built on, you know...&quot; And there is this assumption, like, - &quot;I'm self-made,&quot; and, like, you're not. But then what is even his goal? 'Cause what he can't say is &quot;My dad wasn't rich.&quot; - Yeah. That's just not possible, - provably the case. His dad also married his stepdaughter. There's just so much. His dad... His dad is, like, busy being terrible. - It's too much for one life. 4 years old when he married her mother. - Yeah. - Did Morgan Freeman do that? He married his step-granddaughter, I think. - Ugh. He was like, &quot;Hey, Woody, you have any...?&quot; &quot;I just watched Midnight in Paris.&quot; &quot;I was wondering how to be horrible.&quot; - &quot;I love your work.&quot; - every movie you've liked?&quot; Where's Roman Polanski at? [KENNIE] &quot;What was he known for? Only for [KENNIE] Rosemary's Baby, I only weirdly recently learned that... He did Roman...? No, that the Mansons targeted his house. - Oh, really? he has a bunch of movies that - That's the information I had. You've gotta do the third chapter. Sometimes there's little cultural events - that didn't make it over there. - Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Yeah. I knew, maybe, like, knew them, but I legitimately had no idea - Yeah. They shouldn't have done That Manson shit. Fuck him. - [KENNIE] Fuck him. - [JORDAN] That was funny. You said he was cool. You said he was hot. Charlie Manson. You were like, &quot;I may You're one of those weird - That are like, &quot;Oh my god, I feel like I have to defend myself first No, we'll cut it. You can try. It's a joke. I didn't say that, but... We're making an entirely anti-Kendall cut. Again, the &quot;this you?&quot; cut. We're the ops. We are the ops. Like, honestly, you just where I said I'm just gonna drunk-tweet, 'cause those are fun. I was like, &quot;Ask me questions. Oh, sorry, but not to interrupt you. You said, &quot;I'm gonna Oh, I'm not a fan of Manson murders. Oh, OK. Good, we have - Jacob, cut that. I am actually, indeed, not a fan of Manson murders. We're gonna use, like, - [KENNIE] You can just - yeah. - [JARVIS] So, Love is Blind, season 4. [JARVIS] Um, recently wrapped up. [JARVIS] Um... - I'm sorry. Speaking of being recently - Um, Netflix is murdering their own brand. Uh, yeah, Love is Blind season 4 was, uh... It was marked with controversy. I feel like a news anchor. - Yeah. One - well, a small thing was that they advertised the reunion - as being a live broadcast. And then they just, uh, didn't do that. - They did not. On Netflix, was the idea? Yeah, like a good old-fashioned - Netflix was like, - &quot;What if we were like regular TV?&quot; that that was, like... Apparently it's the second one - I don't remember the first one. I didn't even know there was another thing. Not of Love is Blind, but just in general, - like, streaming. And I don't know what the first one was or if that's actually true or not. Um, but... I... I remember, like, being like watch it when it came on live, 'cause I was like, - [KENNIE] fantastic.&quot; And I just kinda fell asleep And then when I woke up, I was like, &quot;Oh, shit, I guess I gotta watch that.&quot; - Oh, yeah, of course. - Only cool ones. - Butterscotch. - in the first 8 seconds, we're good. - [JARVIS] Yeah. Um...yeah. And so I was a little late to it, and then when I clicked it on - [JORDAN] Really? and it was trending. Everyone was like, - &quot;What is going on?&quot; Well, because if you watch the season, it's so... - tumultuous for no... is that you're gonna see... It's kinda where you're like, &quot;Oh, you might - [KENNIE] 'Cause it's unedited. And by proxy of it being live, it just ended up turning The way I, like, understood it was just mostly little sly jabs at production. - [JARVIS] Mmhmm. Like, um... Essentially, Kwame, there was some controversy because he said he wanted his name to be Alex in the pods. - Interesting. And it kinda came off as far as him as a Black man. - And then, uh... It's not like that was an idea, No, he didn't do it, - He went in as Kwame, but - &quot;I considered going as Alex.&quot; So, it comes off kind of like, &quot;Well, what does that mean?&quot; - [JORDAN] Interesting. &quot;They conveniently edited out where I was like, 'I'm really proud of who I am, - and I don't go by Alex.'&quot; &quot;So, regardless of how that comes off, I want to be known as Kwame, 'cause that's who I am, and my culture and stuff.&quot; He's like, &quot;That just conveniently Oh my god, poor Zack. And then the thing that drove me insane, because a lot of - after the reunion, a lot of people were really upset - at the Lacheys in particular. - 'Cause they did not come off well at all. - In the reunion? He's just kind of like... - And Vanessa Lachey - picks weird fights. Pregnant. Well, yeah. She's like, &quot;So, where's the babies? [JORDAN] &quot;How do you make 'em?&quot; Nick Lachey's only contribution was to be like, &quot;We've taken And it's like, &quot;We noticed, and you - &quot;We love that you grew.&quot; &quot;Uh, even though, asterisk, we put you through this incredibly, like, possibly panic-inducing situation, I love that you were able - Yeah. - Like, that type of energy. Just to ask, where would - Is this one of the strongest - What do you mean by &quot;strongest&quot;? I would say entertainment-wise, it's... For me, it's probably - It's rage-inducing. - [JARVIS] Yeah. - There's a lot of WTF moments. Yeah, yeah. And there's a lot of, like... I think more so than ever, there's a lot of boundary-pushing. - Mm. So, um, arguably inappropriate, I guess, depending on who you talk to, like people flirting a little too much - Yes. Yeah. The mixer, like - hang out after the pods... In previous seasons, a weird conversation after they're seeing somebody but ultimately didn't end up after they already And there's been drama before - that happened in those environments. - But this season took it up a notch. Like, going back to Kwame, right? He ended up having, like, a bit of a connection that he didn't end up engaged to. And how it comes off in the show is, like, he ended up engaged because the other girl - just decided to go with another guy. So, after they've now met, they, like - Also, that's another component. Like, people were really catty this season. - Yeah. 'cause there tends to be - between people. - What was his name, Barnett? Yeah. Barnett went to so I remember him. - But she - I feel like if she was like, &quot;If anybody comes for Barnett, I'm going to chop their Like, I remember her saying But other than her, I feel like it hasn't been - super confrontational. Angela was like his other kinda closest person, Barnett and Angela, - and then Angela partnered up with... She partnered up with - He was, like, very... Was that the girl that drank too much? Um, she was, uh, older than the other contestants. Uh, yeah, I just don't... Oh, what was his name? He was so cute. - He was just the littlest guy. And he was, uh... The unfortunate part is he looked And once Barnett rejected Angela, she just, like, pivoted to, like, - &quot;Well, I'll just take the junior.&quot; - [JORDAN] Yeah. The Wish.com... More portable, yeah. But yeah, there was a lot and a lot of, yeah, a good way to put it. Were there any protagonists? Were there any people that were - Tiffany and Brett. I think you had a much I just thought They barely showed them - because they were perfect. No, but it is a great, like, a non-problematic depiction of Black love - is a nice thing to see on TV. Their conflicts, there's only two that I can think of. One is, uh, when Tiffany asks Brett, who is a designer who, like, - works at Nike... Like a shoe designer and stuff. And his whole story is he designed... He, like, made designs on his own and sent them around or something, - Holy shit. Yeah. And, um... So, one of... Like, you only see two conflicts, One of the conflicts is if he owns any expensive items. - Yeah. &quot;I kind of paid a lot And she was like, &quot;How much?&quot; And then she was like, &quot;Brett!&quot; But I didn't think that - - I mean, it's expensive. the way they were kinda building He also works at a job where I imagine he's traveling a lot, and in meetings where you - Yeah. one of the more expensive ones, - all things considered. - [JARVIS] Yeah. - technology and stuff like that. So, what he's saying is he doesn't have jewelry that's super expensive, things that you would typically I'm a bad candidate for this, because I spend money [JARVIS] And you should be able to do that. I thought that the conversation was like, &quot;What does it matter, if he's - Exactly. Spending, like, on things is only bad - Right. &quot;I'm 36 years old&quot; - 35, 36. - &quot;I work at, I'm like a - upper person...&quot; I should be allowed to, - &quot;I'm passionate about this thing.&quot; - That's essentially the... And that is my favorite conflict, because they were working to - The beginning of the season - - In the trailer! - &quot;This is not...&quot; &quot;We should have planned. This should not -&quot; &quot;This is unacceptable.&quot; And when they show it, I was like, &quot;It's just his shoes are missing,&quot; You're like, &quot;Wait, what?&quot; and &quot;Could you bring 'em in a - Just before the wedding. - 90 minutes before the wedding. It was like, &quot;He's so unreasonable.&quot; Like, some people were really like, &quot;He's being a groomzilla.&quot; - What? - And he's a designer. I thought that was the most, like - Honestly, the coolest thing is when he was being I thought that was really cool. I thought it was one of the few times - [JARVIS] in these shows. Because they do - They bend over backwards to almost strip any Mm. Other than just, like, being the villain or the Well, the example I was gonna give that they always have where they're, like, It's like the producer said, &quot;OK, you and your 5 best friends, or any friends - I don't care if you - talk to them.&quot; Sometimes they don't &quot;Have them interview you after [insert your personal You know? It's like, - &quot;Oh, yeah, after I lost Joe...&quot; - Yeah. &quot;I got really affected.&quot; - They literally did that at one point. - &quot;And who else is dead?&quot; and they took the camera, &quot;You can see her hand on his back It was just, &quot;Oh my god, look at it.&quot; &quot;I was just thinking about David.&quot; &quot;Oh, what's David? What happened?&quot; Have you ever asked yourself, like, if you were in a situation like that, like, what friends you to defend you? - If I was Married at First Love is Blind? If you were given the ultimatum - [JORDAN] The Mole. 'Cause they were in Michigan, so... That's what this season was? - No, no, no. An upcoming... Also, it bled into, like, Portland and Arizona. - Oh, yeah. That was weird. Because I think you're Yeah, that's what I thought. I was like, Insulting to California. I don't know if you guys have seen but it's difficult to bleed And it becomes a major conflict - [JARVIS] Exactly. But yeah, an upcoming season apparently is supposed to be @ing me, like, &quot;You should &quot;I would rather drag my ass on hot coals.&quot; You should go on the show that you, - know is manipulated and untrustworthy. Like, &quot;She's just awful.&quot; I'm like, &quot;You motherfuckers Like you have one of those with all the things that I wouldn't even get engaged, 'cause I'd just be there, stoic and quiet. &quot;These motherfuckers ain't hearing - what I have to say.&quot; [JORDAN &amp; KENNIE] &quot;Uhhh...&quot; &quot;What kinda videos do you make?&quot; &quot;Do you have internet? In which case, &quot;I don't even know what internet is.&quot; - &quot;Yeah. I live in the countryside.&quot; &quot;I've never connected to the online.&quot; &quot;What's making it so that this room Yeah. &quot;I don't really &quot;Where are the hamsters?&quot; The hamsters that power our town. &quot;I'm one of the Arizona Amish.&quot; Did you see - speaking did you see the Insider article? I have yet to read it, but To me, I can guess. Well, 'cause like - I have it - Ooh, can I guess? Undoubtedly, people have been sent into some form of, like, breakdown. 'Cause when you think about it, the actual experience, the entire construction of it, is - you're sensorally deprived for 10 days. You don't have your phone. - you sit there and talk to a wall. And you're talking to a person, one at a time, at the most starved you are - for emotional engagement ever. So, I wouldn't be surprised... like, maybe it's a little late to that I've made a whole But, like, I started to think And that's why I personally feel like I wouldn't feel comfortable even outside of me being on social media, just simply because I couldn't imagine... Like, I don't know. I'm hyper-aware [JORDAN] Mmhmm. By any means necessary. - And if I don't, they'll make it. And, like, is it worth it for love? &quot;Kendall never said it on screen, but mentioned off-camera that she was thinking about Becoming Thanos was something &quot;She was like, 'I won't stop until I've and those were her words.&quot; - Came on here and got attacked. So, Insider put out - and this bothered me. This is a premium article pay to see. - [KENNIE] Oh. And it's about the, like, horrible working conditions But it's called &quot;'Love Contestants say producers preyed on their anxieties, - and refused to let them quit.&quot; - Oh my god. &quot;Refused&quot;? Like... - Well, yes. OK, so... - the contract is like for this. So, in this article they say that if you do not have a you can be fined up to $50,000. So, that makes people want to stay, because they're afraid they're - that no one has on hand. what is your incentive to Are you compensated for the show? Uh, yes. You're paid, as of this article, um, $1,000 a week, which, due to sometimes shooting days exceeding 20 hours... - Yes. Like, you get paid an average - Is that even minimum wage? No. I mean, in California - they're It depends on where you are, but it's - Um... your trauma and turn into a villain online. - Exactly. You're also, like, living in a trailer with like 15 people. And some people have said that they were afraid to sleep in them. Why does this happen? Do you know what I Netflix does not want this press, right? - No. So, just don't do that. Just don't be an asshole, man. - Yeah. Get another trailer. Well, I guess here's the, like, the pessimist in me. It's like, I don't assume anything - No, no. - to avoid this. But yeah, it's one of those things I feel like like, shows like this and things like this are on between making as much profit as possible, cutting corners as often as possible, and trying to do enough to where it doesn't tip - [KENNIE] Yeah. 'Cause, imagine - 'cause not everyone that does the experiment - ends up, like, on TV. So, imagine going through all get possibly whatever benefit - you think you're getting. who ended up with Jackelina, apparently got engaged to and all of his stuff was cut, yeah. - What?! What a pimp. - Aw, yeah. So, remember when he was like, um, - &quot;I'll pack my stuff if it's not you&quot;? Apparently he said that - That was just his line. - That's fucked up. Fuck. - The bar is in hell. weird, warped interpretation - 'Cause the one thing that's and some of the adjacent ones, - Married at First Sight even more so... Not that it would stop me from watching it, 'cause it is morbid fascination, but it does sometimes feel it's kind of silently a kinda Protestant/Catholic relationship - to marriage. Where it's like, &quot;These damn -&quot; Like, &quot;These apps won't let you find love. These Millennials and their apps...&quot; Oh, yeah, a lot of people, - even though you're... And if they're not physically - Immediately. Irina says, &quot;Uh, he looks - &quot;And he doesn't blink enough.&quot; &quot;But I'm already obliged to marry him, so I guess I actually do love him.&quot; Jackelina is like, &quot;Normally I'm into, I don't know, guys who are attractive, and Marshall's really not doing it for me.&quot; - &quot;It's his weird face and body.&quot; I don't know. Maybe this - kinda the hate, even me, particularly, giving to people like Shake. - Well, he was a dick, but he wasn't... But the core premise of, like, &quot;I don't believe that love is blind, so that's why I wouldn't - [JARVIS] Right. If you really make this and you are, uh... your sexuality and identity aligns and that is what you're looking for, you just got a homie. - Yeah. That's great. But I think it, in part, is just blocked by people's idea that, well, there's like once you have - with a person you could marry... - that you're not... (laughing) Do I want to tell this story? Fuck it. So, I, uh... - The preparation. No, one of the closest friends is somebody that I went - like I met on a dating app. I'm the type of person that, like, I'm not immediately attracted to people very quickly. So, I kind of ignore it at first, 'cause I'm like, &quot;I'll end up - attracted to people usually.&quot; - Which makes it kinda... - I guess so. you know, the spectrum where you have to get to know you can even consider - them attractive in that way. Like, if you look back - there's no type, if that makes sense. It's just, like, a person - &quot;Huh, OK.&quot; was &quot;I ain't got no type; bad bitches is the They're not. They weren't even. - [JARVIS] Oh, OK. Damn. - Well, that's a shame. It is. It's... - That's jacked up, actually. getting fucked over by a person It's like, &quot;Damn. I And now you see them after they, like, - piss you off, and they're like... [KENNIE] Oh, no. - Not everything can work out. That's a quote from Marshall to Jackelina. - [JORDAN] Oh, fuck, really? - They're both bad. Can you believe it? Um, so, like, I... We went on two dates. Like, I couldn't hold his hand. I couldn't kiss him, and I couldn't put together why. Oh, you put - you were - So, you're Irina and he's Zack, - and you go &quot;No, no, no.&quot; So, that's the difference. Sorry to compare you to one of I'm like, &quot;First of all...&quot; Yeah. You're saying - Oh, yeah, I see. and I was trying to be honest to him, and that's why I was but I couldn't get out of Mexico.&quot; Um, no. We went on two dates, and in the middle of the second date it clicked. I can't - &quot;You kinda, in a weird way, look like my cousin,&quot; and then And then I left the date. He wanted to give me a hug, and I just did like the And then I texted him And I didn't tell him that at first. And you know what's fucked up? It - Oh, no! He, like, prepared a picnic. We painted each other's portraits. - Oh, wow. - Holy shit. - [KENNIE] It was so nice. It was just one guy. Hi, Kyle. - What's his last name and address? He's - whoa, he's right there at the door. He's single and a great guy. - &quot;He looks like my cousin.&quot; - &quot;If I'd never seen my cousin...&quot; I have been afflicted with cousin-face, - where I look like everybody's cousin.&quot; Yeah. Everyone's cousin. I feel like that's good news, though. - It was very early. connecting with you, but you - and it was like, is there...? If somebody said to me then, &quot;It's 'cause - I'd be like, &quot;Oh, great. Awesome.&quot; - because at first he thought... At first he thought it was because - Oh, that's awesome. He was like, &quot;Damn, was it the painting?&quot; I was like, &quot;No, you look like my cousin.&quot; - &quot;And I realized on the second date.&quot; He must have really had that in his head. - Like, &quot;I fumbled it.&quot; It's in my, uh, living room. - Was it the charcuterie? It was the best seasoned Are you, um, big date-planners, like effort planners, I - well, right now, no. Like, I've never been a big date-planner. - [JARVIS] Yeah. very recently, - within the last... Well, no. I was just You were like Bliss from Love is Blind. - [KENNIE] Very. I keep making references to Love is Blind And Zack and Bliss are awkward but It sounds like maybe - No, it's really good. I think it's definitely worth the watch. You didn't like them at first? [KENNIE] It's not that second chances themes, yeah. So, he proposes to another girl first, and then they meet, and she's the one that's - &quot;You look like my cousin!&quot; - &quot;You look like a cartoon.&quot; - He says she's creepy - oh, yeah. - I mean, he's just an awkward dude. he strikes me as someone - who's a little socially awkward. - holding a katana. - That he commissioned himself, yes. - Yeah. He's a lawyer. You know, he's kinda awkward, and he had a bit of a... Not a bit. He had quite - [JARVIS] Yes. - socially awkward in some ways. He looked like a cartoon? - That seems like a very specific... Sorry. I'm sure he's watching. I'm trying to think of A lot of people said that he either or he looked like, um... To me, he looked like Archer. - Mm. - He's not unattractive, no. Archer, a character whose joke No, he's not unattractive. I think - And that really goes to show, like, if you're not attracted because they're, like, - on paper, unattractive. - love is blind, I thought. I interrupted you. You said you, uh, only started dating recently Yeah. Very religious upbringing. - [JARVIS] Mm. There was like a... kinda like a refractory period where I was like, &quot;I wanna date, but - Right. like, in college or after college, There was just, like, a long, I wouldn't consider myself Um... I would consider myself, like, - agnostic, I guess. Like, I believe there's a generally benevolent... god or gods or whatnot. But I wouldn't consider myself very... Um, but yeah, I was raised very Christian and socially - And so when I... where you grew up? Is that like - your peers were as well? - I think more than the average around me. What corner of Christianity was it, Um, they refer to themselves as, like, non-denominational, but it - Oh, OK. My parents - particularly my mother so that was ingrained. And so when I went to college, I kind Like, there was just too much around me that didn't fit into this very, like, - black-and-white view of, like... That's us. - You're amongst friends. It really didn't fit through I was looking at them Sorry. Um... So, like, I just kinda - slowly found myself, piece by piece, not identifying with a And then by the time I graduated college, I had reached this epiphany that, like, &quot;I'm going back home.&quot; And that's really when because I'm like, &quot;Oh.&quot; I felt very black sheep-ish. - Like, I don't... &quot;you can never go home again&quot; but Yeah. And there was like and that's when I felt comfortable dating. - [JORDAN] Huh. I had to over-explain - and I had to, like... I think that there's who are gonna relate to that. - No, absolutely. 'Cause I think there's this And I make no qualms about talking about being a bit of a later bloomer, um... just because - like, it's more normal than people... It's more normal - Absolutely. I think a lot of people were I'm fuckin' and I'm just - Yeah. I don't know the logistics - Like, how the fuck do y'all have time? - Google Sheets helps. Jacob manages my calendar, so... - He helps us a lot, yeah. And then we thought, Yeah, like, &quot;You're so good at this. Maybe we can expand your role But now it's like the issue It's like Michigan is - not it, dude. It's just fish-wielding... - Wielding the fish, oh my god. &quot;Look what I caught&quot;? It was funny, because my friend - It got to the point that I was just so over it that were like, &quot;Can we have your account so that we can swipe for you, - just to be fun?&quot; And two of them were on at the same time. I didn't realize that. They were &quot;This is unfortunate, like, your choices.&quot; - [JARVIS] Oh, no. Or were they people they were attracted to? Well, they know if I were to have a type, which I don't really, but when I say a type of they have a general idea. And they kinda asked me, And I was like, &quot;Have you - [JARVIS] Right. - Just fish-wielding, camping. - &quot;Wielding&quot; is a funny word, like a sword. Like he'll slap you with it The art of the blade. [KENNIE] Bird-watching. - [JARVIS] Yeah. - And nothing wrong with it, but... in LA there's a lot of people - And the outdoors is fine. It's beautiful. It's great. We need it. - It's important to our livelihoods. like, The Last of Us. Yeah, or like the inside, 'cause I quite like it in here. - It's gaming, is what - - No. OK. In the game, where and that turns you into a nasty, - in the show it's... In the show it's like In the show, you have to, like, uh, have a... - basically you have to have contact. Oh, that's so much more, like... Or, like, bring spore - in the show, they Yeah, you can be bitten or touch like the fungal I believe, right? I didn't watch it. - In the show... - You literally have to be bitten. - In the game it's air and bites, yeah. But I don't know, man. Did you like the second one? - Did you play the second one? Oh, OK, then I won't say anything. I think it is - I have but none of them are I had a wonderful time and then like the big I enjoy looking back on it and I can see where maybe there was production I liked it. I didn't Oh, you had like a little flip? I played it once and just Um, and then I was like, &quot;OK, fine. Let me give it an actual, like, good go-through, considering you set me up And then I played it and I was like, &quot;Ah, - &quot;I guess they didn't go broke.&quot; What I will say, Jarvis, - [KENNIE] It's very long, though. It's kinda like I was where it's not just weighty in the same way the first one is. (sighs) It's... I completely would understand because it's so miserable. Yeah. Yeah. Especially by the time you get to I would say it's cynically miserable in the where there's... there is no - well, there's some, but, like, it's not the focal point of the story. There's no relationship developed or arc taken in the way I don't know where the show ended, - but even with the Fireflies - - Oh, OK. So, even the original ending... - [KENNIE] Shot for shot, a lot. but they are still close and - Right. - It's just miserable. she builds with, like, her partner... Well, that's true. I mean, yeah, but I never felt Not your type. I mean, I felt like her and Riley had more chemistry, but she's, you know, dead, so... If I were in a real-life - Oh, dude. - as quickly as possible. Because I have no interest in living in a world where I'm not in comfort. Oh, yeah, dude, where I, like, - don't bathe on command? You know, like, the start to the first game Uh, &quot;We need to get out of here, because I'd be like, &quot;That's sick. Can I be where it lands?&quot; - Yeah. - [KENNIE] Fuck it, like... &quot;Please.&quot; (mimicking explosion) Um, I do have a lot of nightmares and I'm like, &quot;Do I really or in real life would I just be - I'm quite squeamish. - [JARVIS] Right. [JARVIS] Exactly. What am I They decide to - The only thing that they really took a lot of artistic license with was, like, uh, Bill? - Is that his name, Bill? - They, like, made a whole story for him. It's beloved, right? That's a good part of the show, - or the episode or something? - I was just like... - &quot;Um, they made him gay.&quot; Which he is. - Yes, which he is. I never liked how in the - They kinda just flippantly... there's some gay porn in his car. And they're like, &quot;Eh, OK.&quot; It was... There was an interesting, subtle story &quot;Well, thank fuck,&quot; because that the Redditors have - Right. Yeah. - this beautiful world for him. He created this beautiful world for him. - Yeah, that was really cool. The side characters are wonderful You don't get to spend - but the bits you do get are... Maybe the highlight of the - a really interesting character. definitely left me wanting more - in the show, especially. His behavior, I'll call it, or his story, his arc, he has like a very full arc, is... says a lot about Joel - because it's like, &quot;Oh, they're both, - they both have this.&quot; &quot;Joel isn't a crazy person. They both, when shit needs to get done, - they're ready.&quot; And also... It's implied in the story originally, Tommy and Joel were doing and, like, being smugglers and murderers, - and then they went to Jackson. in the show, a little bit, about - - The allusions at least - - Tommy? Yeah. - He wasn't there much. He... - Like he's in the game. the first episode, and then, you know, there's this thing of - getting back to Tommy, right? It's like when you finally they have like a few moments. But he's really not in it a ton. [JORDAN] I just remembered Everybody thinks it's Skyward Sword. - Oh, yeah. - [JORDAN] How are you feeling? [JORDAN] It's easy, right? Yeah, I was here like... I was telling them and now I'm just like... Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Everybody who's never, or like, has Frogan was really nervous - Mm. - It's fucking easy.&quot; because there's kind of like a like a... a wandering filter in my - [JARVIS] Right. This year, essentially, like, step out of my like, socially in particular, 'cause I'm kind of a &quot;keep to myself&quot; type of person. Like, all my friends have just, like, appeared, if that makes sense. Right. They spawned in. I think when you're just people are like, - They're looking up. - &quot;You're in my eyeline.&quot; It's like, &quot;OK, hi.&quot; Um, so I haven't had a lot of, like, experience... like, initiating conversation - and friendships and stuff like that. And also, because of that, I do recognize that - is kind of to myself. Um.. Oh, like hobbies and activities, or...? Mm, yes and no. To myself simply because of just, like, logistics, like my friends - Oh, yeah. Yeah. the closest ones are 30-ish minutes away, but they're in like opposite directions. And we're mutual friends, - so we have to meet somewhere. And with Michigan snow, like, Like, she's traumatized. It's like really bad, like a lot of driving and stuff like that. And then everybody else lives out of state. - [JARVIS] Right. - college friends, or something, what? - she's high school and college. Um, she is trying to move back to Michigan. Um... And the friends that are in Michigan are both college friends. And then I have friends - One of my closest friends was a subscriber - when I was very early. Um, she's in Tennessee. I have some other friends that I met They're in Florida. How was study abroad in Korea? [KENNIE] Great. I went - OK, cool. I know you did Korean studies, but like... I guess, what came first? &quot;I'm interested in Korea; I'm going to go&quot;? Did you exclusively study it there, - or you did the 3 or 4 years? There's a pretty big Korean You were, like, studying - An Oli London type. - Oh, no. I'm like, &quot;This just seems - [JARVIS] Oh, yeah. - Um, I... I would go - like 3 months at a time. Kind of... Like... so, first time I went was 2015, and I went for school. Um, at the time, I was mulling over the idea - [JARVIS] Mm. and getting my Korean better, and then... That's kinda like where my channel started. Like, it was trying to learn Korean, and then, um, now we're here, however like 10 years or... - Oh my god, 11 years. Take that as a guiding light they don't know whether to make content, 'cause they don't feel clear Just do whatever. - [JARVIS] Yeah. and I just really appreciate my viewers, - Right. But yeah, and I was there at Sogang University, and they have like a language studies - and then I came back. That's Seoul, yeah. And then I went back, and I went to Yonsei like a... essentially like a Korean Ivy. - Yeah, I was gonna say I've heard of it. There was a period in which I was doing - like, trying to combine interests. So, I was, um... Like, I like makeup - [JARVIS] Right. I would work with businesses - Oh, cool. And, uh... Do you still get to be... I guess maybe it's harder now to be immersed in the - My Korean sucks now. And it's so sad, 'cause I spent so long - Like, a lot of my college friends, all of us speak Korean. So, like, when I'm with them - we'll speak Korean sometimes. But... Why don't we have a language? Oh, brother, we have our own weird little language. - 1-1-100100... Yeah. It's Japanese. It's watching weird reality television and referencing, like, Bruno. - That's true. is our language. - That's - oh, have you seen Black.White? - Oh, dear. it is everything you want. It might be up your alley, uh, maybe. - Is it a reality show? I don't even know. So... It's of an era where - You know, it's mid-2000s. It's especially like, &quot;Oh, Like, &quot;A producer directed It's a 6-episode series. - Aired, like, prime-time Fox. Two families - Black family, They use, like, prosthetic makeup - makeup and prosthetics You look like you just whited out Listen to me. They won an Emmy for makeup in 2006. It gets worse. It gets Uh, Ice Cube executive-produced it. - It gets worse; it gets worse. - It gets worse. After the show aired - After the show aired, and they did a whole episode about racial biases and stuff. That sounds very 2005, though. - Oprah scrubbed this from the internet. But they do - Uh, they have a race machine. And there's this GIF - There's this old, of Oprah's face being translated - into different races. - It is wild. But yeah, the dad from it is this white actor who does not believe that racism exists. So, a lot of it is him And throwing out the - Oh, he'll say it. And there's no build-up, Bruno's decided to just say the N-word.&quot; - Oh, yeah. All right. &quot;(grumbling the N-word).&quot; Like, he'll start - Uh... Like, one of the things if I ever got the opportunity to meet, uh, Gabrielle Union is to bring up the movie she did called Neo Ned. - Never heard of this. [KENNIE] Oh. - Look at us exchanging problematic media. Wait, can I - before we start on Neo Ned, can I just quickly show you the - Also, this is a white girl. - was it Ice - ? - Couldn't tell, right? of Black friends that &quot;Actually, I'm a white person.&quot; Oh, they send this girl - she's 16 - to a slam poetry group. - And she... (Kennie cry-laughing) With poetry that - is almost exclusively about suffering. It's only about Black pain and suffering, and she's there the entire time going, &quot;Oh, they're so beautiful.&quot; - Oh, yeah, her mom - Her mom calls Black people - It's just never - it never... - No, it's not. - No, in a good way. - Stop being so sensitive. Yeah, exactly. And yes, Ice Cube does I was gonna ask. OK. Did you get your race card? (Hell naw) Did you get your race card? (Hell naw) I didn't get my race card. Did you get your race card? - Did you get your race card? - It doesn't. It's insanely bad. We talked about it when we watched it, and I think one of the is the fact that there's so many more years of blackface technology - [JARVIS] They've been working on it. They had to get so good at it - You know? They had to build a system. - It started with White Chicks. - Oh my god. Plus they have to do it and, like... They have to overcompensate to the point where they - 'cause it's a white activity. - Or etiquette class. can you guess where they They send him to an etiquette class. So he can act normal. So, what do Black people do? They go to - they talk about - in poetry slams. And white people go to etiquette school. - It's very bad. which is great, and it's like And the whole time, the dad &quot;What the heck are - That's when he drops the N-word. of white people enough, and then he... &quot;Why is this shit not about me?&quot; And then his wife... And then his wife, uh, said the phrase &quot;the N-word&quot; - instead of actually outright saying it. And then he is like, &quot;(scoffs) Come on. They say it.&quot; It has no right being that catchy, though. - Oh, it sucks. everything in the world That's how I felt when, uh, like, the Cuban Americans made a song to vote for Donald Trump. - Oh, dear. - [JARVIS] Is it good? - [JARVIS] Oh, no. Dude, I'm so excited that he's back. - We'll get so much bad media - celebrating his bad personality. Do you remember Bruno's rap? The white dad who, uh, blackfaces as a Black man has a song - What is it called? &quot;Mid-life rapper.&quot; - Mid-life... Why? This is - you - I'm so sad that you have So, this is important for you to see. &quot;Mid-life rap&quot;? I just caught that. Oh, yeah, get ready. [BRUNO] This is something that I made, actually, um, months and months ago. It's called &quot;mid-life rap.&quot; Months before this project even came about, I bought a camera and a computer so and I ended up doing a rap video. After watching rap videos... [KENNIE] I don't know - &quot;And I ended up doing a rap video.&quot; - &quot;A video.&quot; [BRUNO] ...Getting frustrated. I or the middle-aged person should have an opportunity to speak his or her mind as [KENNIE] 'Cause there's [JORDAN] You talk about this. [BRUNO] ...today's rap scene. [JARVIS] &quot;Nick, you might like this. You might in particular like this.&quot; &quot;You might like this because and you've learned to appreciate Yeah, &quot;'Cause you like rap music, And there's no difference - &quot;We're hip, y'all, right?&quot; Mid-life rap. [JARVIS] I'm gonna try not to sing along. [KENNIE] You know it enough to - ? Oh.
