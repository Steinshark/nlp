&quot;It's very fresh!&quot; &quot;All natural, no additives!&quot; &quot;The filling is bursting, very delicious!&quot; Hello friends, I am Dawen. Today I have come to Guangxi Province in southern China. Guangxi Province in China borders Vietnam. Therefore, there is frequent trade and cultural exchange between the two places. This has resulted in many similarities in food culture between Guangxi and Vietnam. This is a morning market in Guangxi Province, which is bustling every morning. It's now 8 AM. At the entrance of the morning market, there is a stall selling corn juice. I found that there are many shops making corn juice in this market. This market only sells corn juice, not corn on the cob. The vendor told me that drinking corn juice is easier to absorb and digest than eating corn on the cob. Drinking a cup of corn juice for breakfast has been a dietary habit of the locals for over twenty years. Customer: I want two cups of corn juice. Vendor: 8 yuan. I often eat corn on the cob, but I've never tried corn juice. I'll buy a cup later to give it a try. Corn juice is a must-have breakfast drink for everyone here. This stall sells pork jerky. There are various flavors of pork jerky, including original, black pepper, spicy, and honey-flavored. Guangxi pork jerky is a classic local snack, tender with a slight chewiness. This is the original flavor of pork jerky. Compared to beef jerky, pork jerky has a softer and juicier texture. Due to the high production of pork in China, the price of pork jerky is usually only half that of beef jerky. This is black pepper flavor pork jerky. In Guangxi markets, you can hardly walk a few steps without encountering a pork jerky stall. Each stall has its own methods and flavors for making pork jerky. This shop uses charcoal grilling to prepare its pork jerky. After grilling, the meat emits a rich, charred aroma. Customer: I want the original and spicy flavors.
