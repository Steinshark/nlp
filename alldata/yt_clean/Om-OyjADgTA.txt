&lt;b&gt;[MUSIC PLAYING]&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Osama bin Laden was a SIGINT target.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We did have some collection on him in the past&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;using a satellite phone.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It has to be a requirement to go after that signal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;for some reason of national security.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We recognized that this was such a complex problem&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that we weren't going to be able to do it by ourselves.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You know in a story this sensational, if it leaked,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and he is in that compound, he could very well leave.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Yeah.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And it's going to take 10 years to find him again.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;[MUSIC PLAYING]&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Welcome to another episode of No Such Podcast.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;My name is Christy Wicks.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I am one of your hosts, and this is my co-host--&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Cam Potts.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And we are joined today by the current Director&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of Operations here at NSA, Natalie Laing,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and former Director of Operations, Mr. Jon Darby.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Welcome.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Thank you.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Welcome to No Such Podcast.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Natalie, please introduce yourself.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sure.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So Natalie Lang, as you said, I joined NSA 27 years ago&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;from private industry.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so I have always been based in what's&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;now called the Directorate of Operations, which&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;is responsible for our entire signals intelligence&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;production cycle, which I believe&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we're going to talk about today.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so most of that time has been in operations,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but I've also spent some time outside of the building&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;as one of our NSA representatives to the Pentagon,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;running one of our operational sites overseas,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and also running our director that's&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;responsible for all the external engagement outside of NSA.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;OK.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Jon.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Well, thank you.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's a privilege to be here &lt;b&gt;I appreciate it.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And I have to say, as a former NSAer, anything I say,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;are my personal views and not that of the agency.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So I worked for the intelligence community for 39 years.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The majority of that time was with NSA.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;As part of that intelligence community career,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I had served overseas for a while.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I've done a whole lot of different things&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to include spending the better part of 10 years from 9-11&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to 2011 working in the counterterrorism arena.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;My final four and a half years was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;as the Director of Operations.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;OK.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Today, we're going to talk about NSA's bread and butter,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;SIGINT, or signals intelligence.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What does that mean?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So let's start with the most basic definition.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What is a signal?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Because that underpins everything.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So in its basic form, a signal is a current, or a pulse,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;or a radio wave, something that transmits information&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and data between systems and between networks.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So each signal, think of a phone call, or a text,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;or even communicating over the internet.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;These things create a digital footprint&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that we would call a signal.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;There are other digital footprints or signals&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we're interested in, like weapon signals, radars, missiles.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So all of those are signals.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Then if you take it and make it signals intelligence,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;or what we shorten to SIGINT, there&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;are two very important qualifiers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that make something SIGINT, the first of which&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;is the most important one, foreign.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The second thing is there has to be a requirement.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So from the President, or the White House,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;or the Director of National Intelligence,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;there has to be a requirement to go after that signal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;for some reason of national security and importance.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So as most basic, that's what the signal world is,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and that's what signals intelligence&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;is, that data that rides on the signal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that we are interested in for national security purposes.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So Natalie, you mentioned making a phone call,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;making a text, or communicating over the internet.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;That reminds me of music.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;When someone records a song, they could be singing,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;or playing some type of instrument.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;They record it, they press stop, and they go to play it&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;on some type of device.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You actually can see the waveform audio.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You can see the sound.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so while it may not necessarily&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;be communicating a hello or goodbye,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;a message is still being communicated.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;As we know the phrase, when words fail, music speaks.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But be that recording music, making a phone call,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;sending a text, or communicating over the internet,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;waves have the ability of interacting&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;with the physical world.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Within the context of intelligence though,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we have the ability of setting things up&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in the physical world to interact with waves.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So tell us about foreign signals intelligence.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What is it, what is the process,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and why is it important to national security?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- So I mentioned two very important qualifiers.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Foreign and we need a requirement.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But foreign is still a very vast amount of signals.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So we need, you're correct, a very specific process&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to go through all this to determine&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;what we want to collect, are we able to keep it,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and then what do we do with it?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So briefly we call that the production cycle.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And there'd be five phases that I can briefly describe&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of what that cycle consists of.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So it starts with the target itself.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We have what's called&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;a national intelligence priority framework, the NIPF.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We make acronyms for everything, so it's the NIPF.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;That framework though, what's most important&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to know about that is that's what drives&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;where to start looking in that vast sea&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of waves that you described.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So that targeting goes through this framework&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and that's the start of the cycle.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The second piece of the cycle then is&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we have these places around the world&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;where we actually go and collect it.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We gather those signals that we've been authorized to do&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and that we find of interest for national security.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Once you collect it though, you can imagine the volume,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;given how digital the world is,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;you can imagine the volume coming in.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So we need to process that data.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This is perhaps one of the most complicated&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and biggest tasks we do as part of that cycle.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So processing it needs the experts who can come in&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and say, what makes this readable for an analyst?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What makes this processable by our machines?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Once that happens, we move into the analysis phase.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so we have a deep cadre of experts who say,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;everything that's happened so far,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'm going to take that data that that produced&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;from those original waves and signals&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and make some sense of it.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Not only based on individual target knowledge,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but also based on what we know our national policymakers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;need, our military leaders need to do their jobs&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and keep the nation secure.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And the way that we inform those policymakers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and military leaders is through the last step&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of the production cycle, which is reporting.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This, I think we'll talk about this probably later&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in the podcast, but this has a very specific&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;regime tied to it, but it's the most important way&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that we get our product out of the building.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;That's how we actually share the information&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in a very tailored and curated way&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;as the end of that whole cycle that you described.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- And you share that information&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;with other intelligence community partners,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;other agencies, even the private sector at times,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;depending on what the information is.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- That's exactly right.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So I mentioned policymakers and military leaders.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Those are sort of top shelf&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;because they are really making the decisions,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but we absolutely share with multiple other partners&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in the government who are also looking to protect&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;the United States, with our allies,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;with our Five Eye partners,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;with many nations who are also looking to protect&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;against joint threats.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And then with industry, that is a big piece&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of our cybersecurity side.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We have foreign intelligence and cybersecurity&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;as our two basis of operations at NSA.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so it's very important to have that exchange&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;with private industry when we see&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;where malicious actors are in all of our systems,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;when we see ransomware attacks,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;or when we're not sure where there are no systems,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and we need to partner and share information to say,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;are we casting the net wide enough&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and making sure we're looking for them&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in the right ways at the right time.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So yes, we share all of that more.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Absolutely, and that can restart the intelligence cycle&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;once you share that information with industry or partners.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- That's exactly right.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;One of the biggest changes that we've seen&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in the last couple of years&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;as part of our national security memorandum&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and our responsibilities there&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;is that we can do bi-directional sharing.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And by we, I mean our cybersecurity directorate,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we can do bi-directional sharing with industry.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So that is the ability to ingest some of this data,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;not just collect and put it out.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Both are equally important.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Now we talked about the steps of the intelligence cycle.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;How do you follow the rules?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;How do you stay compliant when you are following targets&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and collecting signals intelligence on these targets?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- So for every aspect of that production cycle&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that I went through, compliance is our number one focus.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;That has to underpin everything we do at the agency,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and it in fact does underpin everything we do&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;at the agency.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So the bottom line, what we're looking for there&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;is respect for the law.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Obviously we follow the law and our authorities,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but also respect for privacy and civil liberties.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;At its most basic, that's what our compliance program is.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But of course it's more than that in day-to-day activities.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So there's the law.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;There are authorities that actually drive what we do.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And we know them, we know them clearly,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we apply them every day.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But then there's ways to trust but verify.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So every year we test our analytic cadre&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to make sure they have the most recent&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and current understanding of the laws and authorities&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that govern us and of our policies,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;our internal NSA policies that we derive&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;from those laws and authorities.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- And you even get tested.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- And I get tested.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So when I say analytic cadre,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;really anybody touching all of this sensitive information.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And then in addition to the testing every year,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we do auditing.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So we have random checks and we have purposeful checks&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of we said we were compliant, were we really.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So there's fail-safe methods there.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And then finally we have a very robust overseer framework.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So that starts in Congress.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We have several committees that are solely focused&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;on the intelligence community and how we are conducting&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and lawfully conducting our missions.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Then we also have a very specific body called the FISC.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This stands for the Foreign &lt;b&gt;And they oversee one of our most important&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and impactful authorities on national security&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and in keeping the nation safe.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And that's called FISA.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So it's Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And then there's a specific section 702 of that act&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that really underpins so much that we do at the agency.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And it's such a key authority&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that we have a specific &lt;b&gt;to do all the things I just said auditing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and testing and overseeing.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But that whole regime makes up what we say&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;when we say compliance.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So it sounds a simple thing to say, yes, we are compliant.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We have a compliance program.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It is matched with every step&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of that production cycle that I laid out.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- So with foreign signals intelligence, the process,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and then being compliant every step of the way,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'd be curious to know what are some of the examples&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;where SIGINT has been used in the NSA mission?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- So I would offer three very current&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and let's start with Russia, Ukraine.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So those signals that we've been talking about,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we collected those signals and we were able to see&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that Russia had the plans and attentions to invade Ukraine&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;before they invaded.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so we were able to take this SIGINT intelligence,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;contribute it to the whole of government,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;the US government's entire approach&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to deter and try to defeat &lt;b&gt;NSA also share the results of those signals&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;with our close partner, United States Cyber Command.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Cyber Command was able to send before the invasion,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;again, a small team over to Ukraine&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to help them look through their networks&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and point to some activity&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that seemed to be Russian activity there.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So they could shore up their networks&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;from a cybersecurity perspective,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;even again, before the invasion.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So that's the first one Russia or Ukraine&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;would be a very current crisis, right?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The second one I'd offer is China&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and specifically the People's Republic of China.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So SIGINT, these signals informed our understanding,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;the US government's understanding of the Chinese origins&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of a chemical used to synthesize fentanyl,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;which is a clearly recognized national issue.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This information was derived from the authority&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we talked about earlier, section 702&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So this is important in our estimation&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;because NSA plays a key role in keeping all communities&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in the US safe.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And then finally, a third example, cybersecurity.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So SIGINT helps us defend&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;our nation's critical infrastructure&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to include our Defense Industrial Base.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And NSA has used SIGINT actually to identify&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;multiple foreign ransomware attacks.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;That intelligence has helped us, the US government,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to respond to and actually in some cases&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to fully prevent significant attacks on US networks.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;One specific example is an Iranian attack in 2022.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So SIGINT enabled the US government&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to not only respond to that attack,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;also to recover the organization's information&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;without paying the ransom and all of that within one week.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So those are three examples I would offer&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of pretty current application of signals intelligence.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And ransomware attacks happen so often now&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to not have to pay a ransom&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and intercept that foreign intelligence&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and to stop that attack or to intercede&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to make sure that these companies don't have to pay&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and they're protected and networks are protected.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Agreed.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Unfortunately, this is a common occurrence.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Yes.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Yeah, you hear it all the time.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's always in the news.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Exactly.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Now we're gonna get into each of those steps&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;once we talk about our feature story today.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But Jon, over to you.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Let's talk about September 11th&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and how Osama bin Laden was one of the targets&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and the role you played in bringing him down.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Well, I'll start with kind of who has bin Laden.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Not everybody knows the whole story&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and then go from there.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So Osama bin Laden was the founder&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of Al Qaeda, the terrorist group.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Started up organized shortly after the Soviets left&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Afghanistan and Al Qaeda as an organization&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;led by Osama bin Laden, &lt;b&gt;and the US was their primary adversary in their mind.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So they carried out a series of attacks through the 90s,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;actually attacked the World Trade Center in 1993,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;carried out attacks on USS Cole in the late 90s,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;attacks on US embassies in Africa in August of 98.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And then of course the big, the 9-11 attack&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that we've all heard about killed nearly 3000 people here.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So Osama bin Laden was a SIGINT target for a while.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Clearly he was of interest.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;He was leading an organization that intend to inflict harm&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;on the United States.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We did have some inter collection on him in the past&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;using a satellite phone.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fortunately that got published in the media&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that we were collecting him off that satellite phone.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;From that moment on, no more electronic communications&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;from him.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So we had to be creative, you know, how to get to him.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So let's take from 9-11 on,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;so at least everybody has a story.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Those that remember, you know, 9-11, where were they?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What was going on?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;My story is I slept through the whole thing.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Oh, okay.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Because I was on a business trip down in Australia.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;At the time, the way I figured I was probably,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;fell asleep about the same time&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that the first plane hit the building,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;woke up the next morning, saw what had happened.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You know, I was grounded in Australia.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;All federal employees were &lt;b&gt;because we didn't know what else was gonna happen,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;were there gonna be more plane attacks.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And we were, as a government,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;worried something else was gonna happen.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So I was basically stranded in Australia for a week.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And I kept busy by helping our Australian partner agency,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Natalie mentioned, we &lt;b&gt;Australia is one of those key partners.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;That's who I happened to be visiting on the business trip.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So I was helping them, you know,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;basically liaise with NSA,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;who was trying to figure out what to do.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And helping Australia figure out how they can help us.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So, stuck for a week or so in Australia,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;came back to NSA on about the 20th or 21st,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;somewhere in there, walked into my office.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And I shared an office with my boss and I walked in.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And he says, &quot;You have a new job as of right now.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Wow.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- You're gonna report up to the sixth floor,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to the Counterterrorism Organization.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So, okay.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I went up to that,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;the head of the Counterterrorism Organization's office&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and said, &quot;I'm here.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;What am I supposed to do?&quot;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And he basically said,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;You're gonna be in charge of SIGINT development,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;for Counterterrorism.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;And your job is to build an organization&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;and figure out all the different ways&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;that Al-Qaeda communicates.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So that's how I got in to &lt;b&gt;- Okay.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- And then we started the SIGINT development cycle.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And Natalie mentioned that the process, the cycle,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;it all kind of starts with developing a target,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;understanding who you're trying to collect on&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and the different methodologies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to get after that individual.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Yes, so I was gonna say,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;tell us more about SIGINT development&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;as it relates to bin Laden.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What did that process even look like?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Paint the picture for us.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Alright, so I'm gonna break it into two pieces.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Because there's overlap between the two.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;There's understanding how Al-Qaeda communicates.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Our number one mission, number one job,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;was to prevent another attack here in the United States.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And it wasn't just bin Laden.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;There are many other leaders in the Al-Qaeda organization.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We had to worry about that.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So let's start with that.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Al-Qaeda communications,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;how do we discover and disrupt terrorist plots,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;targeting the US or elsewhere?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So we had leads.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We could get leads from,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;let's say materials that &lt;b&gt;We could get leads from other agencies and so on.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And we recognized that this was such a complex problem&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that we weren't gonna be able to do it by ourselves.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We were gonna have to team with other agencies,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;whether it be CIA or the military or others,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that could have leads and bits of information.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;To feed us, we could provide bits of data information&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to them to help with their, let's say, CIA's information&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to recruit assets.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Then the Al-Qaeda organization to get after,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to discover these emerging evolving threats.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So building teams.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And part of that was we actually started a process&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to send NSA analysts down to work at CIA&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and to go overseas.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And the team developed this dynamic,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;multiple agencies working together,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;whether it's NSA headquarters, CIA headquarters,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;or overseas, that team evolved into a really tight team.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And if you fast forward after the bin Laden takedown,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;if you sat down the core analysts&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;from the different agencies, you'd be hard pressed to say,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;is that an NSA person or a CIA person?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Because they were so tightly working&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and passing information back and forth as it developed.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So back for the broader Al-Qaeda mission,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;building that team, and I mentioned for bin Laden,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but this applied across all of Al-Qaeda,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;trying to understand it.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And what I'd like to say,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;it's operationalizing that relationship.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You know it's one thing to just provide intelligence to somebody,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but something that I often said is,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we're not in this business to produce libraries,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we're in this business to support operations.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And what that means is building that relationship&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;with these operational communities,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;whether it's the military, who can do things,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;whether it's FBI, who can do things&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;within their authorities or CIA and others.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So building that team with the operational community&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;was really critical in developing that mindset&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that we're not just pushing out intel,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;it's about follow it to the next level.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What are you gonna do?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;How do you work with that agency&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to arrest that terrorist, for example?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;How are you working with that agency to disrupt that plot?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So that's kind of the broader Al-Qaeda mission,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and their similarities with,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we look at bin Laden himself.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And I'll tell you the fall of 2001,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that's when we started really looking for Bin Laden.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And I remember late night meetings in the fall of 2001,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we'd sit around a table and say, how do we find him?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And one of the early theories was a courier,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;somebody that's gonna be taking care of him.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But that was 2001.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So over time, you're developing leads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and lots of false leads, you run down rabbit holes&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and this wouldn't pan out,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but the analysts never gave up.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And you can imagine everybody had a good idea.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But we say the good idea fairy keeps pushing out ideas.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The analysts felt obligated to check them out,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but still at the core, they're thinking,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;this courier route could be probably a most valuable,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but who is the courier?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;How do we find him and things?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;How do we develop out that courier target, of course&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So with that team that had been developed,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;there were leads passed on, here's a potential,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;this could be a potential for the courier.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Ultimately, one thing led to another,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;SIGINT, human intelligence, and kind of honed us in&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;on who turned out to be the courier&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and the caretaker for bin Laden in Pakistan.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- So Jon, how did you pull all that intelligence together&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and pinpoint where bin Laden was?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Well, it wasn't a huge amount of data.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;That's the thing, it was just bits and pieces.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And I mean, I often use the analogy for intel&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;is like building a jigsaw puzzle,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but it's a jigsaw puzzle with a twist.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And what I mean by that, this particular jigsaw puzzle,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;you may have a few pieces on the table in front of you.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You may have some on the carpet, the dog's eating some,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;some are on the other side of the street,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;some on the other side of town,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;some are at the bottom of the ocean, some don't exist.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Your job as an intel analyst is to find&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;as many of those pieces as you can,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;by whatever methodology you can,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;working with partners or others.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And then you've got to put together those pieces&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;without a box top telling you how they go together.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So it's really, it was a mosaic of different data pieces&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;being pulled together to present the likelihood&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that bin Laden could very well be in that compound.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And we didn't know for a hundred percent certainty&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;until actually the raid took place.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- And that close collaboration&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;is definitely the key here&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in being able to properly get to the answer.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So we have the fall of 2001,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and then you talk about the raid.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;How long did it take to find bin Laden?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- 10 years.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Mm-hmm. - 10 years.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- 10 years. - Yeah, nine and a half years&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;or so, and it was, you know,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and it went in fits and starts.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Okay. - You know,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that there was always the mission to find him.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You know, and it was, it was hard.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You know, there was long periods where there wasn't,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;there weren't any leads. - Right.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- And then some things would pick up&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and let's, here's another lead, let's run that down.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And there were plenty of people that came to me at the time&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;when I was the head of the analytic&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;counterterrorism organization,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;saying, &quot;Why are you spending any resources on this?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You know, he's dead, you're not gonna find him.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And, you know, we said, &quot;No, we will, if he is alive,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we will find him.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You know, the U.S. government will find him.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;That's not an option just to give up.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So the analysts really were persistent,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;running down all the different leads, you know,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;over a number of years.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And things didn't really accelerate&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;about the compound until late 2010 or so.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- So it ramps up in 2010.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I know talking about specific collection on bin Laden&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;is very sensitive.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What can you tell us about that specific collection&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;on bin Laden that can be talked about?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Well, let's start with kind of the first,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;when it became clear this,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;there may be something to this.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And this is, you know, fall-ish 2010.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And one of the lead analysts came to me to&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Hey, this looks like a good lead,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;the best that we've had for, you know, for years&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that actually may go somewhere.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So at that point, figured, &quot;All right,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;this looks like a good lead.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But at that point, it's a lead.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You know, we'd had how many dozens of leads in the past.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So we didn't really know how this would play out or not.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fast forward a couple of months,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and we did read in a couple of,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;this was an ultra compartmented operation.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We read in a couple of technical folks&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;into what we, when I say we, U.S. government,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;were trying to do and working closely with CIA and others.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And they looked at, came up with some creative options&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to potentially get some collection.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I really can't get into specifics about&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;the specific collection operations that took place there,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but suffice it to say that we were joined up with,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;certainly CIA and the other intel agencies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to really get as complete a picture&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;about what is going on in the compound is,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;you know, there were kind of two threads,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;is bin Laden in that compound.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And the second thread is how do we support&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;whatever the U.S. is going to do about that compound?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- So when you talk about those being read in&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to this specific compartment, what does that mean?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- So I'll back up into what does it mean by a compartment?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Okay.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- You know, that everybody that works at NSA&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;has what we call a top secret special compartment&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and TS/SCI clearance.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Yes.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- That's kind of the baseline.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But there are any number of additional clearances&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;on top of that to include compartments&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;for special projects, for example.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So this was, you know, and Natalie&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and I both had numerous compartments over the years&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and special operations.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This one was different.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And what I mean by that is, you know, ultra compartmented.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I mean, there was at one point I got a call&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;from a very senior official at CIA who was telling me,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;you realize this is the most, you know,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;the top secret in the United States government right now.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And I got it.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You know, so it's super secret.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But really is just to kind &lt;b&gt;think about NSA, how big NSA is.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Tens of thousands of people.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The day of the raid, there were no more than 50 people&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that knew what was going to be 50.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And we were very, you know, very tight-lipped.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Very tight-lipped.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Had to be.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- And had to kept close tabs on who actually knew&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;what was going on.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Even updates, we handled that in hard copy.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We weren't emailing anything around about it.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So it was, as I say, Natalie and I have been involved&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;with a lot of compartmented operations.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'll say this was the most compartmented&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that I've ever been a part of.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And it makes sense because we've been trying to find him&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;for 10 years.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You know, in a story this sensational, you know,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;if it leaked, and we knew Al-Qaeda paid attention&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to the Western press, if it leaked,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and he is in that compound, again,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;which we didn't know for sure, he could very well leave.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Yeah, that's right.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- And it's going to take 10 years to find him again.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I don't know.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So it was really critical to keep a lid&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;on what the U.S. government was doing.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- So partnership sounds like the,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;basically the epitome of everything that you guys&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;were working on and working with and HUMINT,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;SIGINT, everybody just came together at the table&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to make sure this man was caught.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;That the people who lost loved ones,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;they deserve that justice.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Let's pivot to you, Natalie.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Talk to us about that processing of the SIGINT chain.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Sure.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So we talked in the beginning about the production cycle,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but I covered that pretty high level.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;As you can imagine, there's a lot of connective tissue&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in between all those steps.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So one of the things you mentioned processing,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'll anchor on that for a minute.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So one of the main things we need to do&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;when we do that collection and processing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;is make this understandable for the folks&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that are going to be working this.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So that's intelligence analysts,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that's language analysts.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so you might be looking at a signal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;or a big grouping of signals that are very complicated,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;highly technical, or &lt;b&gt;So it is our job to not only undo the complexity&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to get to the meat of the data&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;so that the analysts can use that,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but also we have to establish the right thresholds&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;for how to go through that data.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So there's a lot of discernment that goes on.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So to use one very small but specific example,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;John was talking about the couriers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;as we were targeting UBL.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;If we were to go through all this collection&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and see anything that relates to that courier,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;obviously that's something we would discern&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of foreign intelligence value.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We will keep following up on that.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;If it was, for example, a signal that was right next&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to that one of a local taxi driver near you,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;okay, that's not something we would discern.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We need to follow.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So that's one way that we &lt;b&gt;so it's usable and meaningful&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;because the volume is pretty significant.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It wasn't necessarily significant on UBL,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but when they're working a bunch of other things,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we need to make this discernible for them.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We have to have thresholds built in throughout that process&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that say, is the foreignness still there?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Is this, it's interesting,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but is it part of a requirement for us to work&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;from national security perspective?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So all of that needs to be worked in the process&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;for every piece of that production cycle.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Pair that with constant new technologies coming up,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;new means of transmitting data coming up.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We need to stay on top of that.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'm not going to ask an analyst to stay on top of that.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's our job to stay on top of that technical environment&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;so the analysts can do what those brains are so cultivated&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to do, which is get after those hard target problems&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;like the UBL and many, many others.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So that's what processing really looks like at high level.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Certainly, so if you thought you found something&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;relevant to national security interests&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;or let's say as a priority by the president,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;you dug a bit further into it, but it's nothing there.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You stop?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- That's correct.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;No need to pursue further.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Okay.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Okay, so let's just say you had the right technology,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;you figured out the right signal complex.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Talk about encryption and how that plays a role&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in signals intelligence.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- So I'll say two things to start about encryption.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;One, at its most basic, it's our ability&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to secure communications and control access&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to sensitive data.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;That's the easy part.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The hard part, it's very hard math that underlies this.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So hard that I'm not qualified to explain to you the math,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but what I can tell you is that there are very smart people&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that work this and they enable computers to do some of this&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;because to do this in a reasonable amount of time&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to decrypt something, code break,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we need a computer to do that,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;or maybe we need to do computer work for the entire thing.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So it's a simple thing to explain.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's a very hard and complex thing to unpack&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;when you talk about encryption.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so you need very tailored, what we call STEM&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;or technical skills, along with very powerful computers.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so it also needs to be a very wide team.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So we talk about the crypto mathematicians,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we talk about the computer scientists.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It needs a very wide skillset that can actually come in&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and say, we know how to do this.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Now that said, there are still codes we can't break.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We try to do this every day, new codes.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But NSA is the world leader in what we call cryptography.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So it's everything that's wrapped around encryption.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so that is the ability to of course,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;protect ourselves from adversaries&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;who want to get past our encryption&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to get to our sensitive national security data.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But it also involves our world-class ability&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to break the codes of our adversaries&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;or terrorist communications&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;or malicious actors that we've seen.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So that ability at NSA is really world-class&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and we're super proud of that talent.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Breaking coed, making code.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Exactly.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Cryptanalysis sounds quite amazing,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;almost like mathematical magic.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- It is mathematical magic.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Yes, and it speaks to NSA being home&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to some of the nation's greatest and best mathematicians.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Correct, and we've been doing that magic,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;honestly, for 72 years now,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;even prior to World War II.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'm gonna share a couple examples&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that are declassified now that predate World War II&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and go past World War II.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So everyone's familiar with D-Day,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of course, spring of 1944.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The UK and the US allies were planning a big invasion,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;as we all knew, but Germans were tracking this,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;as with the Japanese, for about a year.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What they were not tracking is that we were reading&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;their encrypted communications.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We were reading exactly how all of their troops&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;were set up on the beach heads there.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We were reading what they shared with the Japanese&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;as far as how strong or how not strong&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;their defenses were there.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So obviously D-Day still involved massive loss of life,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but advantage allies for our ability&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to read those encrypted communications&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and know what we were facing,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and it definitely gave the competitive edge&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to the allies that day without question.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And then if you fast forward a little bit&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to after the war and the Cold War era,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we were able to decrypt, so break the code,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in your terms, Cam, of Soviet,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;both espionage communications and diplomatic communications&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;from 1952 to 1980.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Again, huge competitive &lt;b&gt;- Certainly, certainly.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- And then as part of our role for a combat support agency,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in Vietnam, we were able to prepare the troops&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;based on decrypting and breaking some code&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;for the 1968 Tet Offensive.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So looking out for our troops in harm's way,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and again, being able to encrypt plans and intentions&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and share that as part of our military support role.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- And we still do that today.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- We still do that today.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Absolutely.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- We are at our core a combat support agency.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- So we talked about a decryption.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So once you get that intelligence, it's decrypted,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;it falls in the hands of cryptanalysts.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What happens after that?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Does it start that intelligence cycle over again?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- It does.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But what really comes out as a very specific point here,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;when we talked about as part of the intelligence cycle,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;who's doing what?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So that processing of what the language analysts are doing,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;what the intelligence analysts are doing.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So this is a lot of work that we put on top of them.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So from a language analyst perspective,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;again, we want to get this into a readable form.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But what then they have to do,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;it's not just the literal translation.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This is of course foreign language,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;so we need to translate it.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But we have to remember what we're asking&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;the analysts to do.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;They can't ask any clarifying questions&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;on this piece of information that came in.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;They just have to work with what they have.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so whether you're a language analyst&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;or an intelligence analyst,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we're saying take what's there.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Yes, we have to do the literal translation.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But then they have to apply all these years&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of analytic method training, knowledge of their target.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And for language analysis that sometimes,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;what's the sound of the voice?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Have you ever heard this &lt;b&gt;Why are they talking about it right now, do you think?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So we need to report what's literally,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we can't report things that aren't&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in those signals that we collect.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But wrapping that expertise &lt;b&gt;And so us of course providing technology&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that enables that processing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and the intelligence analysis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and the language analysis to happen&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;is a key piece of that whole production cycle.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- That's amazing, I'm sure you've helped mitigate&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;many threats, just disseminating products.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Correct, there's big readership&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;with NSA's SIGINT or NSA's products as we call them.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- All right, and now moving to,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;let's say the last step in our SIGINT process, reporting.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We can actually send directly to the president?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- We can. - Okay.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- And we do. - All right.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- And to many, many other people.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So hourly, probably every minute, frankly,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;there are these SIGINT products,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;these SIGINT reports going out.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So certainly they go to the White House,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;they go to the National Security Council,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;they go to all of our national policymakers,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;senior military leaders, all of our allies,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;our customers in the US government,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;our partners in the US government,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;very wide readership of reports.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But what's behind the report might be a little bit,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;it might be good to unpack here.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so what's behind that is first of all,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;there's a lot of information to synthesize.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so getting it out the door to the right person&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;at the right time needs to be very crisp.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It also needs to be very timely, of course,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but it needs to adhere to what we call&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;analytic integrity standards, AIS.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;There are very specific standards that cover&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;what we can report and the structure&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we need to report it in.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;That includes, of course, no embellishment or opinion,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;it could SIGINT fact, right, first of all.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But it also includes not mentioning or naming&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;any of the sources or methods of how we got this data.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;That is the most critical &lt;b&gt;We need to get that insight out there,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but we don't need to share in every report&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;the source of that.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The other thing that's good to know&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;behind that whole report production chain&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;is there are multiple sets of eyes on every report.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Natalie Laing does not sit down, write a report,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and pop it out the door.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Multiple sets of eyes to make sure that&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I have been compliant in not naming sources,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;the integrity and the analytic standards are there,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and it is the right formatting of the SIGINT data,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;which can be frankly very technical.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So it needs to be the data and the reporting&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that most closely matches some of those&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;national security requirements we talked about&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in the very beginning.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so reporting encompasses everything in between,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;as you can imagine, many, many targets that's going out.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But I will tell you that this is our product, if you will.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;If we were a company, a private company,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;this is our product, and it is exquisite,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and it is extremely impactful&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;on the national security front.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Can I foot stop something Nat about the reporting?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You talked about target development and following leads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and cryptanalysis and all that's really cool&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and difficult and hard to do,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but none of it means anything without the reporting&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;at the end. - Absolutely.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- So that is, you know, some people kind of poo-poo&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and focus on the cool stuff.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;That reporting is absolutely essential.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So saying this agency wouldn't live without the ability&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to turn all these leads into something that's usable&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;for a policymaker or military commander in the light.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Absolutely, and Jon, let's talk about the operation.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You've done it.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What did it feel like the moment Osama bin Laden&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;was taken down during that operation?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Let me back up a little bit to the day of the raid.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Okay. - Myself.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So it was a Sunday out here,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and I was here at Fort Meade and walking,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I still remember to this day,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;walking across a parking lot to come into the building&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that morning thinking this raid was gonna take place&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and said, &quot;I really, really think he's there,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but I don't know that I'd bet my annual salary.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But I mean, the stakes were really high&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;because there was not certainty that he was there.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And even as the raid took place&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and the first helicopter landed hard,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and everybody was like, &quot;Oh no, here's a situation.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's gonna go bad.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So but anyway, Natalie mentioned earlier about NSA's role&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;as a combat support agency,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and NSA has sent folks out to Iraq and Afghanistan&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;for a number of years to support military operations there.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Our role, I mentioned that kind of the two threads&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;is Osama bin Laden there,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and the other how do we support&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;whatever the US government decides to do.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So the government had decided&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to carry out this special forces raid.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So what's NSA's role at that point?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Our job is to make sure there are no threats&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to those choppers that are flying in and on the way out.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So we had people poised,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;ready to provide any indications and warning&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of threats to those helicopters.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Anyway, came into work and NSA had a little command center&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;set up and there were about six or seven folks&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in the command center.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And we had the audio feed from Admiral McRaven,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;who was the leader of the operation,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;who was out in Afghanistan, who was relaying things&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;via audio about as the operation taking place,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;because the assault team lead was relaying it back to him,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and then he would convey the audio link&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to many folks across the DC area and elsewhere&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;about what was going on.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So when he did say HVT number one,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;it was spotted, high value target.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And I remember thinking, oh my gosh, he really is there.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And then shortly after, EKIA,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;enemy killed in action and say, wow, it worked.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And I just remember it felt very surreal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;as the operation was taking place,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;thinking this could be a really big deal.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And then when it actually turned out it was him,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I was just saying, it felt very surreal.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But we knew it wasn't over,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;because the team had to get out.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- That's right.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- And NSA's job still wasn't over.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It was to make sure the choppers were gonna get out&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of Pakistan in one piece.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- You played a key role.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You're able to talk about that now.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You made history.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What does that feel like?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Well, it was, I was just part of a bigger team.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And there were, I mentioned not a lot of folks&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;were cleared for the entire operation,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but there were hundreds of folks across NSA&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that were playing a role in providing,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;answering the question, is he there,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;providing the support during the operation itself.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Many of those folks didn't know what the purpose was.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Basically said, you need to do X, Y, and Z.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And they did it, because we're used to living&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in a world of secrets and protecting things.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So I just happened to be fortunate enough&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to be in the job at the time that,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I liaised with the other agencies&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;at the senior levels and was there,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;hearing things as it played out.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It was an entire team that played that out.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I will share a little personal story.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The night of that raid, the president made a statement&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and I wound up staying at work all night,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;putting together briefings and emails to folks&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;telling what had happened.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And that Monday night I got home&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and my wife had put two and two together&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;because I'd been out all weekend.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And I did call her up on Sunday night, woke her up&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and said, you may want to turn on the TV.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'd say the president said, &quot;Have a statement.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But I came back in and then she goes,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;so wow, you must have played a part in this.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And do you want a steak dinner or anything?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;A steak dinner.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- And I said, all I want is a pizza.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And then I sat down and I literally cried my eyes out.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I mean, total shoulder shaking,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;let it all out, just crying my guts out.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And it was just such an emotional release.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And even before that, the night after the raid&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;had taken place, I actually walked up&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to one of the analytic shops that had been working&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;around the clock for a couple of weeks&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and told them what had happened.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This raid just took place.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We got Osama bin Ladin and everybody in that office&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;just started cheering and crying and hugging each other.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And that was a pretty emotional time&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;just to see that reaction.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And there were other parts of the NSA enterprise&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that heard what had happened and they were like,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Okay, check that box.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Let's move on to the next thing.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So very business-like, professional,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;let's keep moving forward.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So you had the whole range of emotions about it.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;As you say, for me, it seemed very surreal&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;from the outset that it actually happened&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;all the way to that total emotional meltdown,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;24 hours later.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Certainly.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I was gonna ask what was the reaction&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;because I know that there were many&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that didn't necessarily &lt;b&gt;on, they just provided the intelligence that they needed to&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and just went from there.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But to hear the reaction of someone&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that actually was a part of this mission success&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and even just being at this table,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;being able to talk about it is amazing.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- That's why we come to work here every day&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;for that impact.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Natalie, over to you.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What do you remember about that day&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;when Osama bin Laden was taken down&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and can you kind of reflect on what it means to you?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- So I completely agree with John's assessment&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of it being a surreal experience,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but it was also a very impactful experience,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;both personally, professionally, for our nation,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;for those that had loved ones that died on 9-11,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;impactful for so many reasons.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But those impactful things stick with you.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I also remember it's a Sunday.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The day of the week doesn't matter,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but I remember that as well.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And just to underscore a big piece of what&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;made this a success was how compartmented it was.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so I was serving at the time as the Chief of Operations&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;for all of our analysis and reporting parts&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of that cycle we talked about.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And I didn't know about this raid&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;until a couple days before.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And I came in the day of to, of course,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;support from authorizations and operationally,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but it just shows the intense collaboration&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and trying to keep this as tight as possible&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to protect the people&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and then protect the outcome happening,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;which of course did.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So I do remember us having a sense of,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;this is kind of what it's like to live&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;through a very important moment of history,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;a very impactful moment of history.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so I'd certainly say those are some&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of my biggest memories from that day.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Absolutely.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- SIGINT is our bread and butter.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What does that look like today in today's society?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Let me say this.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Here's what's changed and here's what hasn't.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Okay. - about SIGINT, right?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Here's what hasn't changed.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Our ability to impact in a positive way&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;our nation's national security, to defend our nation,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that has not changed.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The tremendous talent from before World War II,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;before we existed, to when we started to exist in 1952,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;every day I am a little gobsmacked at the talent&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that we have at this agency&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and the things they are able to do.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So that's that talent and tenacity produces things&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;like supporting the UBL raids successfully&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and so many other intelligence outcomes&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;for this nation and our allies.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;That absolutely has not changed.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And what else hasn't changed&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;is we can't tell people about it generally.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So laboring at these really important things&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;for our nation and our security,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and you can't talk about them,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;yet what you know is amazing.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so it's just an interesting spot to be.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But what has changed is I'd say how we do all of this work&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and the environment around us.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So if you look at how fast technology is developed&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and the pace that it changes today,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;the velocity and volume of information&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that has changed drastically,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;the way everything is interconnected&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;outside of NSA,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;just from a digital innovation, digital world,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;it's all interconnected.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This has changed the way that we need to do compliance.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so we can't just say,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;hey, what worked for compliance 30 years ago&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;when we had analog signals,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that is not going to work for today.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So we need to figure out to adapt our ability&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to maintain privacy and civil liberties&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;along with all of these new interconnected technologies.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So that has significantly changed&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;over the course of our 72 year existence.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Okay.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- I want to add on one thing more about the talent,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;which is one of the big reasons why I worked at NSA&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;for so long was the skill and dedication&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and motivation of folks across NSA.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Yes.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- It can be reflected in the persistence of the analysts&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in the bin Laden operation.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But as Natalie said, it applies across so many,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;hundreds if not thousands of other targets&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and operations ongoing every day.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And I really, I reflect back on the comment&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that our former director, General Nakasone made&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;at one point with a visitor, he said,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;if you want the impossible, come to NSA.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And NSA again and again does things that folks say,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;oh my gosh, I didn't think that was possible.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But NSA has come through and it's the people that really,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we've got all the computers and technology and all that,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but all that is meaningless without the people underneath.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's just, I felt really privileged&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to spend the time I did with the folks here at NSA.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Natalie, Jon, thank you so much for joining us.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Thank you for sharing your stories.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Thanks for having us.&lt;/b&gt;
