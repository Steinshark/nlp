CONGREGATION: A reading from the holy gospel CONGREGATION: As Jesus approached Jericho, a man who was blind was sitting When He heard a crowd going by, He asked what was happening. They told Him, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth Then he shouted, Have mercy on me.&quot; Those who were in front sternly But he shouted even more loudly. &quot;Son of David, Jesus stood still and ordered And when he came near, &quot;What do you want Me The man said, Jesus said to him, Your faith has saved you.&quot; Immediately, and followed Jesus and all of the people, praised God. The gospel of the Lord. CONGREGATION: Praise to You, Dear, brothers and sisters, today's passage follows a series of and misperceptions about and the suffering He had to So, today's passage follows one a real blindness of The blindness of the heart. Despite this, something amazing happens in A blind man sitting by recognizes Jesus Therefore, we could say that he than those who followed Jesus. They found that He was initially shows that He was not with those We remember that one of the adopted was In other words, the person being one of those on Those who followed Jesus after Secondly, the blindness that had befallen those Those who sternly ordered the thought that he did not deserve compassion, and healing. These blinded them to the fact part of Jesus' ministry when they, themselves, were Dear brothers and sisters, to understand Jesus' mission in we need to remember in the synagogue of The spirit of the Lord is on Me because He has anointed Me Good News to the poor. He has sent Me for the prisoners and recovery To set the oppressed free, to proclaim that they are Leaving aside the fact that restoring sight to the blind was part of His mission. The marginality of cannot be ignored when reading any of the texts in the gospel. The marginality of those being This story is rich in meaning, especially when we consider for inclusion and exclusion. Sight and blindness. Both literal and spiritual. As Jesus is passing by, the blind man calls out, &quot;Jesus, Son of David. Have mercy on me.&quot; The crowd tried to silence him deeming him unworthy This crowd represents those who think they know the way Who determined who is worthy or not of Jesus' attention. They see the blind man only An interruption to their Someone on the margins. Easily overlooked and dismissed. Yet in this moment, the crowd's Though they are physically they are blind to the deeper is for everyone. Especially for those and pushed aside. Jesus, however, stops and calls He does not see an but a person of dignity made in the image of God crying out in faith. &quot;What do you want Me to do for Offering the blind man a voice, agency, and a moment of When the man replies, His request is not only for but also for the For inclusion in a world that had cast him aside. Jesus hears him saying, Your faith has healed you.&quot; Immediately, the man's physical But what is even more profound Jesus grants to all who The man's faith opens not only his own eyes, but also of those around him. Dear brothers and sisters, this passage speaks deeply to Too often like the crowd, we can become blind to those who We may overlook the poor, the marginalized, the differently abled, those with different Those who practice their faith and traditions that are Those who do not fit into our of what it means to belong. Sometimes our blindness but spiritual. We fail to see Christ in the We may be so focused on protecting tradition or preserving our comfort that the cries of those for mercy and inclusion. Jesus' response is a call to He stops for the one who Inviting him into the centre, and into healing. He teaches us that is not about exclusion, but radical inclusion. Those whom the world Christ sees as essential members And in the same way, those of us who are comfortable in the need to be healed To see the needs, the dignity, and the faith of those we might Those we sometimes call sinners. In this story, we are invited, to ask ourselves, who are we in our churches and communities? Where do we need Christ so that we can see with Let us remember that true sight comes not just from seeing but from recognizing in those we too often The challenge of this passage is on the margins, but for all of To be healed of our blindness With a faith and humility Fully open to God's grace.
