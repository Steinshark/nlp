D: Alright, let's go *Intense Moosic bois* *Jaiden* One time in elementary school there was like- *Jaiden* AHH! *Jaiden* It was like a 6th grader *Jaiden* He was like, &quot;Jaiden, do you wanna play airplanes with me?&quot; *Jaiden* And I think he just wanted us to go to the playground and like run around and go *Jaiden* *Jaiden* And I said no. *Rip that person* *Laughing* *Jaiden* It didn't sound like a good time to me.. *James* You were in sixth grade? *Jaiden* Sixth grade. Maybe 11? *James* I guess- I guess sixth grade is a little old. *James* That's cuz you have a mushroom. (wat) *James* Sixth grade is a little old to go like playing airplane. I had a- *Jaiden* *James* *Sad music* (Insert comedic joke regarding number of friends owned by friends) *James* I went over to his house. Also whenever I would go to his house, *James* He would say, &quot;Do you want to play?&quot; And it's like we don't say play anymore. (Hey, that sounds like that 1 part from Diary of a wimpy kid) We say let's hang out. *James* Um, and then one time I was over and.. And what is it JAMESSSS *jk* *James* He said, &quot;Let's play house!&quot; And I was like, &quot;House? Really?&quot; We're like in sixth grade man. We don't play- *James* Ahhh!! *Jaiden* Ahh! *James* Oh wait, we forgot our mushrooms (aka drugs) *James* *Jaiden* What do the coins do? *James* Uhh.. literally nothing. *James* So if you spin jump, you can jump on this shell- *James* This hasn't happened yet, *James* But when we both (aah) at what see (don't die) when- when I die, I appear in this bubble..! *BOTH SCREAM AND FREAK OUT* *Laughing* *James* See, since you popped me, I can- we keep going *Jaiden* Oh dope *James* Having multiple people is actually really easy, *James* *James* You just have to make sure you both.. don't.. die. :).

I'm just getting flashbacks to the level me and Madz played *James gets Vietnam flashbacks* And we are back Oh, I turned it off. No way you turn it back on time is of the essence. Come on Both are laughing about how James attempted to turn it back after 1 try then does it Tornado. Oh Get the- get the checkpoint. Got it, Oh careful *Laughing* Is thier still lava, I don't know. Maybe we're so high up. Really really high. Oh, these are new these things are new. Oh and that tornado thing No, oh I thought it was gonna kill you, oh those gear things yeah, those are called tracks so that means There is still lava. NOOOO *Laughter* Get the coin it's really important Look at my face its like wow *Laughing* I think well (Wait what Jaiden) we live toget-Ahhh We live together. We live together. We die together that type of deal Yeet.. *Jaiden is making monkey noises while James says* I don't know if the lavas chasing us anymore. Want to wait to see if there's lava *Thinking*......

AHHGG *Laughter* Oh if you like you have to hold down B to like *Jaiden* Oh careful* You do hold like you to hold down B to do a little extra jump on those Springs Oh, I tried to like you press on you, press a jump right when you're yeah, I don't think I didn't hit the sweet spot. Yeah NOOOOO I've been playing hollow night and there's this part called the path of pain and it looks pretty similar to this. It took me 2 Hours to do it was really hard. There's a lot of saws in platform games. Why is that? I don't see saws too often in real life. I'd died (Rip Jaiden aka Lui- Jk we arent doing this a second time Lol). Okay.. NOOOOO. *James* Nooo Luigi. *Jaiden* Go on without me. *Laughter* Okay, remember about the sawwwww. *Jaiden* Carefu,l the saw Silence...

Thank you, thank you for your sacrifice *Jaiden* Your Welcome Careful with the saws that's not here. Careful with the saws, okay this time hop me pop me *James just ignoring the fact that Jaiden said to pop the bubble XD Then fails Wait what anyway. *Jaiden*I told you to pop me *Laughter* This level sucks (Rip creator). No, I like it. Ahh Being trapped in a shoot being trapped in a room of lava. Okay, it's really terrifying especially rising lava, isn't it? Oh, this is the first furthest we've got careful. There's gotta be another saw I knew it more saws AHHhhh No no Sorry ok. Nooo. I panicked. Isn't it like you'll be dead before you actually hit lava because I hope so there's only one way to find out right Is this a saw part? Mm-hmm? Oh, thanks, watch this Okay Please be over point please be the end. I don't like those donuts. It's gonna go, okay I thought the lava was gonna go up and I'm I was gonna be like Jaiden Screaming at the celebration thing OMG SURPISE PARTY (GONE WRONG, SOMEONE FLEW AWAY, MY PARENTS THREW ME OUT THE WINDOW, IT RAINED MONEY, THE PILLOWS TURNED INTO METAL, SHAGGY KILLED GOKU, PENNYWISE CAME AND DANCED, POKEMON CAME TO LIFE, MY DOGS TALKED, SHREK CAME TO LIFE AND DANCED, MY FRIEND DAVID GOT A TRAMPLONE AND WE PLAYED DROPKICK, MY PIGGYBANK TURNED INTO A BANK, AND SANS FROM UNDERTALE BLASTED MEGOLOVANIA).

He was a furry. Yes, Oh help the screens moving Is that the glumba, that's goulumba yeah Glumba. Oh That's not what it's named Glermberg Glumberg. Ahhh Go in there No checkpoint ha when Mario maker first came out. All right. All right They didn't have checkpoints (They didn't at the beginning of the game's release but when someone touches it they can only get a mushroom). Ahh. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok, don't hit me. Well you think yeah Going's I hope we don't need that fire. A gopher (aka Monty Mole) Yep. I'll protect you. Thank you NOOooo My death killed you 1up don't dead ah When one of us Falls we both die. Do you think that they did that on purpose? I think they did that on purpose. I don't know if they did it on purpose There's so many glitches in this game. I don't know Nintendo was trying to do things on purpose or not He's in his underwear. Did you see that? I don't like how the There's like a line right here. Let me see that. Yeah watch I'm gonna touch it We have to be very- we have to be very careful at this part. Oh go in the pipe. I killed you. Wait, that's not even a difficult part There's just a bunch of we just keep following and killing her like the hardest part Is that one death kills us all yeah, and then when we're both trying to do what we get in each other's way Okay. Okay. You know what? I'm sorry. It's literally two mushrooms An expert-level isn't it. You you you go Uh-huh. All right.

Well im back Oh careful Okay, one more one More really good one so glad we're not streaming this. Ah, I went back in the pipe what makes like the flower fire Idk ask game theory he might know It's red the fact that it's is it like a poison flower? What what in the mushroom makes them like grow twice as big nature is amazing is your window careful careful with me Wait what What are you doing. OHHHHHHHHHH I forgot that happened. Yeah Look at his underwear laugh at him and not us ......................................K Maybe we should get the fire flower. I mean I mean the Firefly Yeah, are you sure you're still in it be careful Okay. Well I've had enough This is the Ross one. Okay. This one was made for two players. Someone did it in six seconds. Is that what that means? Yes, do you want to know why? Because they cheated okay, so there are on and off switches you are familiar with them how do we do this with only two people and then you You probably hit it and I jump on to that one over there But then that one will turn off. Do you look at this tutorial? Do we need to call Ross? I Ran and hit on and died then I'd switch it so you could land on that one. Oh, I get it. Yeah, let's do it. Ready set go Okay, that that's definitely work ready Yeah, Oh Oh then you drop down Anyway, so drop down you see those that that blue Looks nice is that when we die is that we don't have to start at the very beginning level. Okay. Okay ready? Um jump down. All right now hit that button and die Well that's a bit weird but I guess that's what Ross says to do and how did Ross even create the level with only 1 player Alright now can we get over there? That's what I'm gonna try and do how far can you throw me? Let's find out Oh you did it Okay, now I know how far you can throw okay, you have to hit the on thing again, right Alright, so get down to that. Well, I have to go you have to switch it on for me. Yeah. Okay. Are you ready ready? Okay, and then do you have just we have to do the same thing again, we have to hit that button Nope, that's hard. Alright, maybe we should have a third person. Here we go You did it. Okay, okay so get on get it over on the red side now I'm gonna try and hit this nope UGGGGHHHHH Yeah, I think it is a one motion thing, I need that momentum, oh wait hit it and ready one two three Okay, I'm sorry, but I think that's definitely it. Yeah, guess what? We got in the bag this I It worked though I just couldn't get it there because I have to be careful because if I Oh Yeah now Popa Papa Papa, let's do the grab thing again, okay you do it because I don't trust myself Okay I'm gonna hit this Do it. Im coming for you Ross. Uhhhhhhh And so the stress began Oh No the time, oh no all right, all right Hit it Every time to reset it We have to go right there so we can only switch this on and off like once. I totally forgot about time Yeah, we all suffer from it. Okay, wait, how about you stay back and push it? Okay... Frick We'll both take turns so now is my turn. Okay Shoot. Try right landing on those two blocks up there Go. Oh no I thought it was my turn Okay, I forgot yeah I hit you and not it alright ready and go Okay, I think if you go down, that's the end is it?
