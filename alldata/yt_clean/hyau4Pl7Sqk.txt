ZEB HOGAN: Think [MUSIC] Well, this monster fish can MAN: Oh! Oh! Oh, my God! ZEB HOGAN: Weighing as this territorial giant makes [MUSIC] Amateur video show goliath anything and everything And craziest of all, [MUSIC] Once fished to near extinction, these protected ocean giants are [MUSIC] So, I'm in Florida to catch a and see if it really is the [MUSIC] Oh, my God, it's huge! [MUSIC] Known internationally as a of the world, people here and around the water. But some people think there's a lurking beneath the surface By the mid-1990s, goliath they became listed as So, under current U.S. law, it's illegal to handle or So, to see how these I'm gonna need to I'm out with Chris Malinowski from Florida State University. [MUSIC] Very little is known about So, Chris is trying to what they eat and whether is actually making a comeback. Not only is his research crucial but it's the only way I I don't see any how are we gonna CHRIS MALINOWSKI: The to catch them is actually It's basically a rope. ZEB HOGAN: We're gonna be with a hand line. This is big, heavy duty nine hundred pound And then, pretty much the Look how big that hook is. We wanna be able to as soon as I feel a bite, I'm with the grouper and I'm trying Is there a chance we'll catch CHRIS MALINOWSKI: There's a lot in this area that we ZEB HOGAN: Some of CHRIS MALINOWSKI: Some 14 foot hammerhead so these are massive fish. Sharks are a whole When they get to the surface, sharks will use their they'll swing their So, if we catch one, we'll only into the boat to unhook it, before releasing it What bait are we gonna use? CHRIS MALINOWSKI: So, we're chunk of Bonita here. Okay. So, it's very important because we're catching you've always gotta 'cause if a fish it'll take you right ZEB HOGAN: Okay. CHRIS MALINOWSKI: So, All right. Then hold on to keeping that in front of you, ZEB HOGAN: If that float starts the water, that's an indication But I have no way of knowing or a goliath grouper. I just know that it's [MUSIC] Wow, there we go, got one! Fish! [MUSIC] It's coming towards the If it's a grouper, it's Oh, oh, here we go. Shaking, shaking. [MUSIC] It's coming up, can [MUSIC] shaking. Oh, I see white, it's Oh. Woo! Man! Sandbar shark, see the huge that's characteristic Making another run! We're gonna try to get this CHRIS MALINOWSKI: Okay, hold, that's enough. ZEB HOGAN: Yeah? There you go. Yeah. It's a big, probably you can see the big Watch out! CHRIS MALINOWSKI: Got slapped ZEB HOGAN: And these they'll throw up their if it senses something close So, right there, it can't really move its head for a bite, so this is the Got a tag? CHRIS MALINOWSKI: Got one. ZEB HOGAN: We're so it doesn't have its CHRIS MALINOWSKI: Let's go. ZEB HOGAN: Okay, CHRIS MALINOWSKI: Ready? ZEB HOGAN: Nice. Good work, guys. CHRIS MALINOWSKI: Yeah. That was good. ZEB HOGAN: That really but I wanna know if the goliath So, it's time to Ugh, fish! Oh! Gah, it feels like we Go round the other side? Ugh! It's running. It's running. Watch it, watch it, Let it go, let it go, let it go. Waaaa. It's a large shark, big it's probably eight JESS: Watch it, watch it. [INAUDIBLE] ZEB HOGAN: Here it is. JESS: Yeah, nice. ZEB HOGAN: We got Hey, we got the tail, so now, easier, and we're gonna bring It's a really beautiful shark. Watch out. Got it? CHRIS MALINOWSKI: Here ZEB HOGAN: Oh, my God. We got to cut the hook out. Woo, man! [LAUGHTER] That was a big fish! Sharks are clearly an They're so quick to our bait. We're gonna need to drop more of catching a goliath grouper. Oh. Fish on. Oh, man! Fish. It's really heavy. It's hard to hold on to it. That really is like Feel free to help me. Three people, three of us. Goliath grouper can weigh And right now, that's CHRIS MALINOWSKI: Pull, Think we got it! ZEB HOGAN: We're CHRIS MALINOWSKI: Keep pulling. Keep pulling. Just watching my feet. CHRIS MALINOWSKI: Keep going, ZEB HOGAN: Aghh! CHRIS MALINOWSKI: Remember on the leader part. Oh, man, it feels heavy. Goliath grouper, big one! Yeah, it looks big. [MUSIC] Ready to get it on board? CHRIS MALINOWSKI: Here it comes. ZEB HOGAN: Nice, awesome, man! Big fish. So, first, goliath grouper, Towel over the head of A tube in the fish's mouth to And we're gonna strap it down, it stays secured Check it out, our first They're one of the largest Grow up to about eight feet Everything about this You can see big head, The dorsal spines are almost And this kind of classic Lighter belly, darker back. One of the most impressive grouper, not necessarily the thickness, all of the And that's what I'm feeling hand line, is this to try to get back down JESS: When you're and let me know ZEB HOGAN: Okay. One five three, is that right? JESS: Yep, one five three. Awesome! ZEB HOGAN: This is a How much would you CHRIS MALINOWSKI: Probably ZEB HOGAN: That's a big fish. CHRIS MALINOWSKI: Yeah, ZEB HOGAN: Amazingly, this heavier and weigh eight it's fully grown. Chris wants to find out what And he's figured out a bizarre just that with a plastic pipe. The easiest way to get the put my hand and my arm all the CHRIS MALINOWSKI: Go all the back of its stomach. All the way? CHRIS MALINOWSKI: Feel around for anything ZEB HOGAN: Oh, gross! It doesn't smell Feels like I'm putting or like a raw steak. I can't tell what Oh, there's something in here. ZEB HOGAN: Agh! [LAUGHS] Agh! [LAUGHTER] CHRIS MALINOWSKI: It's JESS: We'll take it. So, put that in here So, you can see here, that's you can also see which will be from probably not ZEB HOGAN: I was expecting to The groupers' normal It's crabs and smaller fish? CHRIS MALINOWSKI: Exactly, they don't swim very fast, so very fast prey, they often into the sediment. even though the goliath a big bait, normally, on the food chain, on And that's an important clue. This goliath grouper wasn't for big prey like To hook this grouper, right in front of it on Okay. JESS: Hold. You're ready? Perfect. Okay. Fish is tagged. We ready to get this CHRIS MALINOWSKI: We're ready to ZEB HOGAN: But before I something big is Aggghhhhh! Fish on. Oh, my God, it's huge! ZEB HOGAN: We got a fish! It's just like pulling a Agh, looks like a grouper. Seeing that pale, Arghh. I'm fighting the fish and up behind the boat here. Let's get a look at it. Woo, oh, man. CHRIS MALINOWSKI: I'd have five and half feet long. ZEB HOGAN: So, we caught These guys say once we get the first bite, then what's going on and they'll creating a feeding frenzy. So, check out this mouth and it's not like a shark On the upper and lower jaw are that are pointed backwards, so and try to pull my so that's exactly what would in a grouper's mouth. They can open their mouth the grouper will suck and use those teeth to grip the prey whole. So, this is an important clue. Groupers are not biting and they're sucking it in Which makes total sense now small fish and crabs, hardly It's a re-capture, so this have already caught Okay, tag number 96F2508. JESS: Got it. ZEB HOGAN: What are the tags and the fish's movement patterns? CHRIS MALINOWSKI: If we're over and over again, that means because they have a very they don't move a lot during ZEB HOGAN: So, that's Goliath grouper patrolling large expanses They'll find a wreck and make that their home. Unstrap it first. ZEB HOGAN: Strap's off. CHRIS MALINOWSKI: Good. ZEB HOGAN: See you later. Wow! Working with Chris and his two big ocean predators, I now know that goliath Even though goliath grouper they're not feeding on They're not violently ripping like some sharks, they're And goliath grouper aren't like those sharks I caught. They're sticking to one finding small prey So, why are there viral large prey on the surface? MAN: Oh, oh, my God! [MUSIC] ZEB HOGAN: I leave Chris and of Mexico, where some of these It's here in the small town of are gonna help me set I wanna see whether of goliath grouper are true. And if so, figure out why is behaving so aggressively [MUSIC] I'm out with Dan. He's a Florida local, and he has encounters with and this is something I'd We're about five, six fishing above an This is a popular fishing reef come to the surface Oh, got a nibble. [MUSIC] Got something. Fish on! [MUSIC] Oh! Lost the fish. Something big came DAN BOURCIER: Yeah, you three, four-pound fish on there and got him about halfway up. ZEB HOGAN: So, that's what People come out here to the goliath grouper So, I witnessed firsthand a and I know there is some truth So, how do you avoid that Dan? DAN BOURCIER: Well, the best you just reel as quick as you away from the bottom. ZEB HOGAN: And so, as soon it's a race because there's chasing it? DAN BOURCIER: You hit ZEB HOGAN: Fish, fish! Get him up, get ZEB HOGAN: Just trying to So, it's a race now Agh! God. DAN BOURCIER: Come on! Get him off the bottom. Come on! Woo! Woo! As long as I reel in fast, get as quickly as possible, DAN BOURCIER: That extra either has to rest or to swim Your goliaths are gonna ZEB HOGAN: The viral videos make People are going out to goliath grouper. They're putting bait in a weakened fish on the line are coming in for an easy meal. MAN: Oh, oh, oh, my God! [MUSIC] ZEB HOGAN: So, even the majority of their diet on goliath grouper will if it's dangled in front of I wanna see if this 'easy meal' on scuba divers. To do that, I'm going He's been fishing and diving for spot where I can dive So, where are we TOM MCLAUGHLIN: We're headed a hundred feet of water. It's the kind of place ZEB HOGAN: The entire wreck it's all broken apart. We're gonna focus in on where Tom says the grouper [MUSIC] This is my first dive. We're in about a hundred feet where Tom's seen a He's also seen a lot of so I'm excited, feeling just wanna get in the what's down there. I love the water, but that what's out there is still a Out of the murk, the gloom I emerge below me. And I need to be careful. Swimming in confined spaces There are lots of things Suddenly, I look up and in moving in the darkness. And as my eyes adjust I'm face to face And I'm not sure how It seems to sense my presence I'm seeing grouper poking their in the wreck. Swimming up a ledge, and seeing a grouper sitting None of the grouper So, now, I wanna try the and introduce an easy meal. We're sitting on top of the swims by us. The second Tom spears that jack, the atmosphere The reef becomes more tense, As we're swimming up the wreck, big coming out of the darkness. It's not a grouper. It's a bull shark. One of the most dangerous And it's coming right at us. [MUSIC] ZEB HOGAN: I see this light pointed snout, sleek body, more A seven-foot bull shark, it and circles back behind my head. This isn't a good situation. A lot of people get bitten these circumstances. And it's circling us, It's obviously cued in We need to get out We move down to a crack in vulnerable to the bull shark. But the crack in the wreck are sitting. And the grouper are also because we have this fish. The grouper are being much more obviously interested in I pick up the fish, hold it comes in, grabs the whole head in its mouth, pulls it We can still see the bull shark So, we need to get back up as quickly as we can. And so, it's clear into the equation, it triggers So, now, I can see that video grouper, what it looks like it's actually just going after That's a clue that these grouper that some people They're not searching out big They're detecting using their lateral line I've yet to catch a fully But I've learned these fish only and rarely move, so I'm gonna He's one of the only people on to catch and land goliath so he knows all the This is my opportunity to try grouper I can find and collect along the way. Before we are able to we need to catch our bait. There are a bunch of birds right and I can see action on If we can get right in get some bait. Oh, yeah, you can see they're right behind the boat. Just moving my rod back and that tube just a little Make it look a little bit They're coming. We're gonna get a bite. Yeah, I got one, yeah. [MUSIC] Oh, he's running, got a fish. Man! TOM MCLAUGHLIN: And ZEB HOGAN: Yeah, It just took like Oh, there it goes! [MUSIC] Nice and this is good bait? TOM MCLAUGHLIN: ZEB HOGAN: Grouper just TOM MCLAUGHLIN: They definitely Even much bigger fish than ZEB HOGAN: Barracuda can get and this size is about three, That's an impressive fish. Long, slender, pointed nose, and those very sharp, They have a reputation for So, the fish that I'm after in one bite. Now, that I've caught it's time to catch my [MUSIC] Where are we headed right now? TOM MCLAUGHLIN: We're gonna go It's an abandoned dock, ZEB HOGAN: So, this is kind of a some big fish? TOM MCLAUGHLIN: There're a lot in the 400 and 500 pound range. ZEB HOGAN: We're fishing essentially in [MUSIC] The grouper, they're actually Their heads pointed out. And we're gonna try I'm gonna drop the bait down. As soon as I feel the Tom's gonna drive the boat and see if we can land a fish. Ready? TOM MCLAUGHLIN: Yep. TOM MCLAUGHLIN: Yep. Drop it! ZEB HOGAN: So, I wanna keep the the bottom, just keep so we can see when [MUSIC] Okay, I'm on the bottom there, Just wait for that [MUSIC] Oh, bite, got one, got one! Oh. No, no. Man! So, they're down there, into those pilings On the bottom. Reel up a little bit. [MUSIC] Getting, there's something. Got a hit! TOM MCLAUGHLIN: That's ZEB HOGAN: Reel! [MUSIC] Yeah! Got one! Fish on! Holy! Whoa! Fish on! Got something here! It's back behind the Strong, shaking its head, It's pushing back down we're gonna try to get this It's coming up, it's coming up. [MUSIC] A grouper. Look at him, shaking Wow. Nice fish. Whoo! Look at that. Tom's gonna drive the we're gonna park quickly and release this fish. Okay, we have the We're gonna put it in this net. Get a closer look. So, this is the first time live grouper. So, by comparison, So, Tom, how can you TOM MCLAUGHLIN: So, it's partly ZEB HOGAN: So, do you this mottling is TOM MCLAUGHLIN: Absolutely. ZEB HOGAN: This fish here growing up in the mangroves, starting to maybe now, get venturing into deeper water. Four feet, two inches and [MUSIC] Okay, it's tagged. Tag number five seven five four. This isn't my big grouper, Catching a juvenile and not a adults might have left this their annual migration And so, the best chance for a TOM MCLAUGHLIN: Most they're gonna be offshore ZEB HOGAN: We're just gonna hold you can see the tail moving. He's ready to go. [MUSIC] Awesome. [MUSIC] Tom thinks that the giant offshore. And when groupers do forming large clusters to breed. So, my timing could be perfect, spawn, I could find of monster sized grouper. And there's one place So, where are we TOM MCLAUGHLIN: Here's we're headed towards the wreck. It's a giant freighter that kinda broken apart, ZEB HOGAN: So, we're in 95 you can see this line This blip, right below and then a big school of fish This big school of fish might we're looking for. But there's only one I drop into the water and there's a strong current. I'm swimming along, No grouper. Looking into cracks. No grouper. Maybe this was a false alarm. Maybe there aren't And then, as I come around all of these grouper Six, ten, fifteen just as I can see in the distance. They're the size of small cars. I'm swimming right into the of one of the largest [MUSIC] You only see something like And here they are. All of these goliath grouper Ready to spawn [MUSIC] Man that was one of the Nothing could really prepare together like that. Fifteen giant [MUSIC] I've struck gold! Now, that I've found where it's time to catch one! TOM MCLAUGHLIN: Yep, as fast [MUSIC] ZEB HOGAN: It's running We caught this fish, hooked above the bottom. And he's running back down to to get snagged on anything. It's making its third run. Aghh. Whoa! [MUSIC] ZEB HOGAN: He's moving the boat over but I got some line on him now. Trying to make another run. Ohhhh. Just had a huge run, so with anytime I can reel, I'm reeling. All right, my arms are burning. Oh, there we go! I see something down It looks big whatever it is. Whoooo! Oh! It is a he's right out here he's coming up to the surface. Nice! Big fish! Beautiful color. This one is a little bit bigger, probably five and a Beautiful brown, mottled color. So, you can see this it worked in about 60 seconds. Okay, you ready? One, two, three. [LAUGHTER] Hold on. That is a big fish! Whooo! Now, that we've got it on board, the size and weight for Oh, man, the technique works. Deep water, fishing and the biggest TOM MCLAUGHLIN: So, we're gonna And then, put this saltwater and that's gonna allow him to ZEB HOGAN: So, we're on a get the tagging done, get and get this fish TOM MCLAUGHLIN: Five ZEB HOGAN: Five so almost as long as I am tall. I'm guessing probably a and believe it or not, they We got the length; time to get this fish TOM MCLAUGHLIN: Yep. ZEB HOGAN: And gone. That was the biggest goliath But we're not catching Where are the seven I wanna try increasing the I'm gonna have to catch There's a school hundreds of fish just [MUSIC] Oh, look at that! TOM MCLAUGHLIN: Bull shark! TOM MCLAUGHLIN: And ZEB HOGAN: Fish on! Agh! Two sharks right I'm gonna try to get this fish Oh! Come on, come on! There are two big bull sharks though and they will come up right off the line. Just trying to bring it up to Aghhh! [MUSIC] If we can get three or we have a good chance Powerful fish! It's a bait fish, but It's like maybe a Whoa! Phew! I've beaten the bull Nice! Beautiful! This is the perfect-size to Little Bonita, it looks like like a tuna, too. Real powerful burst of speed. Believe it or not, a goliath Cool! Okay. Let's get [MUSIC] We keep fishing until we [MUSIC] Got one? [LAUGHS] ZEB HOGAN: Ahhh! I got one! ZEB HOGAN: Two fish on! Ugh. TOM MCLAUGHLIN: Yup! Perfect bait size. ZEB HOGAN: This is the bait a really big fish. TOM MCLAUGHLIN: Yep, go! ZEB HOGAN: Fish on! Whoa fish, fish, fish! Come on! Shhh, no, no, no, no, no. ZEB HOGAN: That Man, as soon as that bait is in and this is something bigger. It's almost impossible to and this fish is doing it. It's bending the rod this feels like a larger fish. Whoa! This is the biggest So, I need to remember Come on, come on, come on, Yeah! It's pulling a lot of line. This fish has pulled more line. Oh, it's hard to He's really swimming. Oh, this could be a big fish. He's running for that wreck. It's hard reeling in. It feels big. This could be it! This could be the fish! Oh! As fast as I'm reeling in, the The boat is being pulled This is a 32 foot, 18,000 by a fish. [MUSIC] Getting it now, oh, it's Ohhh... Woo! Man, this is the big one. I've done it, it's amazing. It's the fish I've A monster sized grouper, it's gonna be impossible for into the boat. So, I'm gonna get a length, tag [MUSIC] It took all the strength I Tom's help, to get this Now, that I'm in the I can see just how Seven feet long, about Just massive. It's longer than I am tall. The girth of it, I probably The spines are almost as long Check out the size of its tail. This is a big, big fish. I mean, a lot of people are very aggressive, but I can see it for what it is. They're not being aggressive, they're not trying It's just sitting there calmly. No danger to me whatsoever. [MUSIC] So, what I've learned is that they're finding on the bottom, And they're more curious when it comes to humans. And they're only coming to the to get an easy meal. [MUSIC] Even the biggest of these or the monster that they're [MUSIC] Fish is recovered. It's ready to go. Just gonna take it out Give it a push down. It's gonna be gone. [MUSIC]
