I'VE BEEN SINGLE FOR A LONG TIME. AND SINGLE, WHEN YOU'RE DATING THAT DATING SCENE IS LIKE A DELICATE BALANCE, WHEN YOU GO ON THAT FIRST DATE, BECAUSE YOU GOT TO COME OFF LIKE A GOOD GIRL. YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU HAVEN'T SLEPT AROUND AND YOU GOT GOOD MORALS AND STUFF LIKE THAT, RIGHT? BUT YOU GOT TO EXUDE JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF SKANK SO HE'LL CALL YOU BACK. RIGHT? VERDAD QUE SI? THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH. NASTY-ASS. BUT I DO HAVE ISSUES. I LOVE MY MEN, BUT I DO HAVE ISSUES WITH MEN, AND LATELY, ONE OF THEM IS HAIR. SOME OF THEM HAVE TOO LITTLE, SOME OF THEM HAVE TOO MUCH. I DATED THIS GUY, RIGHT? HE HAD A TOUPEE, BUT WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT. HE NEVER BROUGHT IT UP. IT WAS LIKE IT WASN'T THERE. YOU KNOW, LIKE WHEN SOMEONE'S TRYING TO HIDE A COLD SORE AND CHIT? LIKE, YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT IT, BUT YOU KNOW IT'S THERE. SO I DECIDED THAT I WAS GONNA SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT, BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS, I HAD A COUPLE OF DRINKS. HA HA! AND I GOT REAL STUPID. I WAS LIKE, &quot;PAPA, I GOT SOMETHING ON MY MIND.&quot; &quot;IT'S A REALLY HAIRY SUBJECT.&quot; &quot;AND I DON'T WANT TO SWEEP IT UNDER THE RUG.&quot; HE NEVER CALLED ME AFTER THAT. AND THEN THIS OTHER GUY OH, MY GOD. I WAS DATING HIM FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS, RIGHT? WHAT HAPPENED WAS, I FINALLY PUT MY ARMS AROUND HIM EW. IT WAS SO THICK UNDER HIS SHIRT, I THOUGHT HE HAD A BRACE ON. I WAS LIKE, &quot;BENDITO, HE GOT SCOLIOSIS. AND THEN I REALIZED EWWWW! THE HAIR WAS SO THICK, IT WAS LIKE HE HAD VELCRO. HE TOOK HIS SHIRT OFF, AND IT WENT, &quot;CHKKK!&quot; I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE HAVING YOUR OWN BULLETPROOF VEST, 'CAUSE THAT CHIT WOULD STOP A BULLET. I COULD SEE HIM WALKING DOWN THE BLOCK. POP POP &quot;OH, CHIT! I GOT HIT! NO, I DIDN'T. IT'S RIGHT HERE.&quot; IT WAS SO BAD, I SAID, &quot;YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S WAX IT,&quot; RIGHT? CHECK IT OUT. SO I PUT THE WAX ON THE STRIP, I PUT THE STRIP ON HIS HAIR, AND I PULLED, BUT THE CHIT WAS SO THICK, IT PULLED THE WAX OFF THE STRIP. IT'S HOPELESS. AND PEOPLE TELL ME I'M TOO DEMANDING WHEN I DATE. AND MAYBE I AM BECAUSE I REALLY INSIST ON A MAN THAT READS. I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME. GUYS, THE CAPS OF THE SNAPPLE BOTTLES THOSE ARE NOT ENCYCLOPEDIAS. I GO OUT ON A DATE RECENTLY, AND I TELL THIS GUY, &quot;ARE YOU AWARE THAT THE UNITED STATES DID NOT SIGN THE KYOTO PROTOCOL AND THAT WE ARE LAGGING IN THE BATTLE AGAINST GLOBAL WARMING?&quot; HE'S LIKE... &quot;NO, BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT KANGAROOS CAN'T WALK BACKWARDS?&quot; AND I'M NOT SAYING I'M OLD, BUT, GOD DAMN IT, IT'S DIFFERENT MAN. IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE WHOLE DATING SCENE, THE CLUB SCENE, WHEN YOU'RE IN YOU'RE 20s AND WHEN YOU'RE IN YOUR... LATE 20s. 'CAUSE I REMEMBER BACK IN THE DAY, MAN THE BOUNDLESS ENERGY THAT EXISTS WHEN YOU'RE THAT AGE IT'S AMAZING. I REMEMBER BACK IN THE DAY, I GET TO THE CLUB AT 9:30. 9:30. AND AT 5:30 IN THE MORNING, AFTER EIGHT HOURS OF DANCING AND PARTYING AND RUNNING AROUND, I'D BE LIKE, &quot;AH, NENA, I'M NOT EVEN SWEATING.&quot; &quot;WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO NOW?&quot; CHIT, NOWADAYS, I NEED TWO WEEKS' NOTICE. I NEED TWO WEEKS TO GO TO THE TAKE MY PROTEIN SHAKE, MY VITAMINS, GET MY EKG CHECKED, CHECK MY BLOOD PRESSURE, HAVE A PHYSICAL, SEE IF THERE'S A DEFIBRILLATOR IN THE CLUB, SEE WHERE THE CLOSEST EMERGENCY ROOM IS, SEE HOW LONG IT TAKES THE PARAMEDICS TO REACH THE CLUB. I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE, I'M TELLING YOU. I GET TO THE CLUB NOW AT 9:30. NO, I'M SORRY, 12:30 BECAUSE GOD FORBID ANYBODY GETS THERE BEFORE 12:30. AN HOUR LATER, 1:30... &quot;OOH, I'M HURTING.&quot; [ GROANING ] &quot;NENA, WHAT'S THAT SOUND?&quot; &quot;THAT'S YOU, BITCH. STOP THAT CHIT ALREADY.

I APPRECIATE THAT.&quot; I AIN'T GONNA LIE. I'M TIRED OF TELLING THAT JOKE. PEEWW AAHHH. WOW! NOW, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I RAG ON MEN, BUT I LOVE MY LATIN MEN. IDO, I LOVE MEN. AND I REALIZE THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. I DO. MIRA COMO ESTOY. I REALIZE MEN ARE IMPORTANT TO ME. AND YOU KNOW WHERE I REALIZE IT THE MOST? WHEN I GO TO THE GYM.
