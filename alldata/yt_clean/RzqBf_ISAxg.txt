Welcome to Sad Boyz, a podcast - I'm Jarvis. - Hey. - when you do the intro. - And I... I have... listened to songs way fewer times - than we've done episodes of this show, and I do a better job lip-syncing to that. Like, there is something about-- The cadence I know. - Right. There's this little bit. Like, &quot;Welcome to Sad Boyz, &quot;The podcast that - &quot;And other things also.&quot; - Last bit I crush. Well, I don't know the key. But someone could - That'd be fun. But there is a... something on the Patreon, where you can get, uh, close to 60 episodes of Sad Boyz: Nightz. Full-length episodes of the podcast. There's gonna be another one there But... when Russell was on, we listened to the podcast - and people were commenting-- People were commenting that and I think it's 'cause I ripped it - back when I was a kid. (modifying tone) &quot;Hello. Hello.&quot; 'Cause I used to do, um... Literally, I'd listen to those podcasts. 'Cause they're still running. I think it's now called... Well, at the time it It's a Dragon Ball podcast from this very, very long-running that at the time was called Daizenshuu EX. It then, uh, merged with another, um... another fansite called, like, But now it's called Kanzenshuu, and I think they did uh, change the name of the podcast, but it's a big sort of... historical record And how many--how long - The podcast? 2006. I've been listening to it Oh, dude. You and me, - [JARVIS] True. We are young. - But... It's been running forever. Uh... And I, in The Random Podcast intro... They would always do, like... I can't do it now but I introduced the podcast like, &quot;For the week of--&quot; I had a thing, like, for the week of so-and-so, And I would have music playing, 'cause I was just ripping off of-- I mean, I think that's the... that extremely embarrassing-- I'm almost far away from it enough now but we watched the very first - Oh, yeah. I made no more videos. But there's something You know, I've got that nervousness on the - and if I yell or joke it's like... But there is something about... my cadence. I think That's what the bit is. - The edit is that pace. I was such a huge fan. Hate him now. Can't stand-- - Haven't caught up in a while. We did a panel at VidCon - He was just such a sweetie. I think... it was either that that I was on with Tay Zonday - of &quot;Chocolate Rain&quot; fame. - Yeah, it's very weird. - &quot;Cool.&quot; People didn't get the song then. He was talking - Stay woke. Imagine if someone, uh, stayed dry? - [JARVIS] Mmhmm. Others felt, &quot;I don't wanna [JARVIS] Jordan, you were with Frogan, Capri, and Raff. Yeah, dude. You're an op. Everyone around me. Cash ruins everyone around me. At the smallest provocation, - They had so much prep. by Frogan for oppo research, Before we get into that, we have Aura is an app that helps you control is shared on the internet.

You loaded me up. Yeah, guess who? The woman I love. The woman I love shut my ass down, - Damn. Ooh! I do--OK, here's the thing. We already did this with Baldur's Gate, where you talked about something and then we became insufferable. - But... Oh, there you go. And I do feel... that I am already... primed to enjoy Marvel Snap, is the thing. - It is--your Hearthstone instincts. but back in 2014, before I ever made a YouTube video, I was like, &quot;I should A legitimate thought crossed my mind. I used to play it every day after work. I got Legend every season. - [JORDAN] You were the Hearth bastard. Big fan of Ben Brode of Second Dinner, uh, developer of Marvel Snap, so when Ben Brode left Blizzard and I was like, &quot;I will be &quot;That's when my career will begin.&quot; And, uh... and yeah. I mean, I still have memories-- A lot of the first Twitch stars You know, like Disguised Toast I mean, there's the OGs of, like, Reynad. Uh, shoutout, Firebat, dude. Shoutout, frickin'... I met Forsen at the - Was Forsen a Hearthstone streamer? Oh, yeah. And some of the very first-- In BlizzCon, there was a... the first pre-release tournament There's so many iconic I haven't caught up but I was watching a video... from, um, a creator by the name of J1mmy, with a 1 instead of an I. - He's a RuneScape creator. - I think you've shown me... He also randomly was at, um... a birthday party that... I wanna say we were both at? I can't remember if I saw you there. And... (laughs) Ran into him there. I think they're not based in LA. I don't wanna dox them, Uh, J1mmy and Flutten. - One city down, everyone. - Keep hunting. But he does these, um, video essays on MMOs, mostly RuneScape, but he just tried playing every WoW, 'cause there's a bunch of different 'Cause there's OG, and then where they brought back And then they have and then they started re-releasing the expansions in expansion order. - And it's super confusing and convoluted. - Support is waning. But yeah, he put out this - He maxed his level in like all of them. Or not on the most recent one, He was going through it, and I was like, is all of the proper nouns.&quot; - I don't know any of the lore. But via Hearthstone, I'm like, Talk to me about Illidan Stormrage. Talk to me about Mal'Ganis,&quot; or whatever. And I'm like, &quot;I fucking know.&quot; I don't know what changed-- I think when I initially left LA for the two years or I'm still very close with a good handful-- Edwin VanCleef. Shoutout, brother. But I just left was here for a year and a half, then left. Leaving San Francisco You know, call me Fortnite, - [JARVIS] Right. hung out less with a lot of the - Marvel fans that I knew, or most of the friends that I have now... typically, if they're into superhero or from an analytical point of view And I also fell out of I keep abreast of it, but I wouldn't And I... still... When I picked it up... I was pitching Katie on it. I'm like, &quot;You know when And then, um, while we were chatting about it, uh, I was like, &quot;No, I'm not really but it's just independently And then I caught myself going, like, &quot;And you know what's cool? A lot of the mechanics are really tied Like, say you were, just a simple, straightforward deck. - Right. to make clones of himself. and he will duplicate himself. but if you have--&quot; - She's packing her stuff. - Putting... packing MY stuff. - [JORDAN] &quot;What the hell?&quot; - &quot;What's this?&quot; &quot;It's your things.&quot; gold, and also your energy.&quot; &quot;Wait, no, it's Marvel Snap gift cards. - Leave and open it at your own house.&quot; - Keys. I buy a car. &quot;See ya.&quot; - &quot;Wait a second, this is just my stuff!&quot; phone open, eyes crusty from a - The sleep bastard. Unconsciously, thumb hovering by the $100 Pro Bundle. $12,500... blue whatever. I barely know what the points are called - that you upgrade cards with. that I didn't do my - Dumbass. - but I'm back on my bullshit. - Uh, yeah. I went... - I went half-elf. Yeah. But, um... I just remembered that I didn't do that. And, uh, I will be doing it right now. But... Oh, also, shoutout, Hafu and Dog, uh, the cutest couple that, in my head, is the Hearthstone heartthrobs. - Um, also OG streamers. just since we're on YouTube stuff, very first 10/10 YouTube fan? Not necessarily a community, but specific channel? - 'Cause WheezyWaiter's very early, but-- - Vlogbrothers, for sure. Um, but... Yeah. Oh, so this episode of Sad Boyz... Uh, Snorlax, we got a - It's only a Wednesday. Yeah. Snorlax, no! Jarvis, I can't die, No! Snorlax, it's not like that. You are not the first friend I've had, Oh, is that a threat, Mr. Lax? If you delete the app, it's dark in here. (laughs) &quot;Help! I can't see!&quot; - I just turned my phone off. &quot;I've not slept in two months!&quot; Uh, I don't know if... we can include it in the show. and I got in a little hyperfocus mode OK. I, you know, texted you about it. I'm chewing on the idea of try it on the Patreon. If people - I don't know. But a D&amp;D campaign. And one of the NPCs-- We could set up cameras I'm thinking, with all [JARVIS] We've got - You. You. - Get it! - We wanna get Eddy and Chrissy involved. - [JARVIS] Yeah. People can steal this if they want is a Pokemon trainer character, - if anyone would be interested. That uses a-- I wrote out a set of - tools that lets you capture people. and then I'm back in again, - just to get the good feels. precocious kid that just or a disillusioned guy in their late 40s. Oh, man, I would love to fiddle around 'cause I think there's so many ethics of... Well, not even the ethics, being a world where as like a career path. It would be you're from some isolated island - Yeah. In this particular sense, - Like Palworld stuff. they have no perception So you re-release them. You throw a ball out and they're I didn't have a beard when I went inside!&quot; It's like a coma. &quot;Who's the president?!&quot; &quot;How long have I been inside?!&quot; &quot;Officer Jenny? Interesting.&quot; &quot;I'm finally free!&quot; Like, - &quot;Oh, shit!&quot; Uh, that does--that has to be disorienting. - What, for the Charizard? and it's like, &quot;Hydro Pump!&quot; - &quot;Jesus Christ. Can I have coffee?!&quot; Today's episode, we have like a lot of... things to get to. It's gonna be like First, how are you, buddy? Um, you know what? - I'm doing pretty good, I think. Uh... It's the funniest thing, it's almost like a little more implicit It's just like, &quot;Hey, - you know all the details already.&quot; &quot;So here's a general sensation.&quot; and you can go, &quot;Oh, so this thing that Right. A lot of the things pause or fear or anxiety or whatever Visa stuff's going well, or at least I have a lot of UK estate stuff related to wrapping up I say that like we had a bunch You just have to do stuff when-- Insane that the first thing is, &quot;I'm sorry for your loss. &quot;Name and initial, just real quick?&quot; - Just a lot of that stuff. Even that's starting to It's expensive and - To have the audacity. You cheeky bastard. - I mean, I'm glad we don't own anything. I'm sure that's a whole shebang. Why do I keep using &quot;shebang&quot;? - That's cool. - Shebang! That could be... - It's a whole lot o' jazz! Figuring out this stuff's - Joe Biden's 60 right now. - But yeah, it's... - [JORDAN] Yeah. - He can't get drafted. He's too old. Shin splints. Uh, but yeah, a lot of that stuff so I guess the things that I'm... When that happens, explore and experiment with my medication. I'm having the opportunity I mean, we were just changing some big things about my... - Well, I don't wanna-- Yeah. Some, you know, changes that will become apparent Um, trying to become - Good. two nights ago, 'cause I just Yeah. I slept super late last night, You've become something No, I... Doing... all right. And that's, like... Uh, quietly all right. Not some big thing that's It's more like an accumulation And then we've just been doing more. I've been hanging out with people more. - and it was like... It was like, &quot;Oh! You can do this?&quot; We were just hanging out - We were just hanging out. justifications to hang out, because, like, why do you have to be most of the time you're hanging out? That's what was weird about the Eddy one. Like, it was literally two days later, - Yeah. - I realized you don't have to-- Yeah. &quot;What if we--?&quot; - &quot;I haven't slept in a week and a half!&quot; What if we--hear this. Now we're brothers. - We could be brothers. and we all move in together. What if we started a company? How about you? What's up? - Uh, I'm good. Yeah, no sleep considered... I'm fine. I went to sleep The night before that, and it was like... justified both times. The other night, I was like... talking a friend through It's just boring. Like, MrBeast was like, &quot;What's this mean?&quot; &quot;He's probably talking to other women,&quot; Um, but the, uh... Other than that, though, I'm good. I started a new medication two days ago that's supposed to... help with some of my... It's like in addition to other so it's supposed to help with some things. But because it's new and I haven't been drinking coffee, 'cause I'm nervous and I won't be able to So I'm like... not that-that tired, but... I think of coffee or caffeine, there'd be something more organic - and changing the cocktail of medicine. But I... - love the routine of it. I don't even think I like I've got a big bag of decaf beans here, - because I just love the ritual. I would love a quarter-caf. - [JARVIS] Mmhmm. I don't wanna say &quot;productive,&quot; - And I also get a tasty brew. - we do know tea exists. 'Cause I feel like &quot;Well, let me tell you It's like they turn into youth pastors. Like, &quot;You know, &quot;Ah, you wanna know about the first tea?&quot; - (laughs) - Yeah. &quot;The apostles were...&quot; - The Bible 2, what's it called? - &quot;Guess who's back!&quot; - &quot;Guess who's talking. Again.&quot; - &quot;You aren't gonna believe this.&quot; It's a still frame of him ripping - &quot;You can't stop me.&quot; - Six fingers. I'm sure there's gotta be some grift where somebody does AI and then resells them on Amazon. Uh, but OK. So... Do you mind if I ask - It's OK if not. 'cause it may be nothing. - You know? - Turns out. Yeah, it might be a placebo. - But also, until I'm... tuned in, I don't wanna until I have something going, you know? Is it... are you feeling...? How do you feel about bringing Well, the thing is--I feel fine about it, 'cause I'm like, uh... (sighs) I'm just... It's like this medication because you're trying to... solve for... something, but then you and then you're trying to - And then... from the professionals is like, &quot;You could have one of these Yeah, and you don't know why, and they can act on the same... They can act on the same neurotransmitters or inhibitors or intake To be clear, this is that doctors will give you sometimes, is, &quot;It can hit the same stuff, Well, yeah, 'cause it's like, hit me different than Vyvanse, right? It's like they're very similar We had like the exact inverse experience, - 'cause I tried Vyvanse and it... didn't work well for me. - And you had a bad time with Adderall. - Isn't that weird? (laughing) Like, isn't that weird? That was my weird Adderall side effect, is that I was like, &quot;Guys, I cannot poop.&quot; And the doctor's like, &quot;I don't...&quot; They're like, &quot;No.&quot; except for the pooping thing, and also I feel like when I take a tiny dose of Adderall.&quot; Like, &quot;No, that's fine.&quot; I'm like, &quot;This is fun for people? Oh, yeah. This is, &quot;I've gotta &quot;Let me just do a bunch - of unpleasant feeling.&quot; Though I was, um... Just 'cause it's been so long &quot;Maybe there's...&quot; I'm not getting the whole... There are so many variables in everything. There's environmental variables. There's what you're eating, - Like, what your stress level is. Caffeine. You know, You might have weird stuff - And... I think we've both recommended at least exploring medication with no... Short of financial, uh, preclusion, right, like some medication is Aside from that, if you're 'cause you're concerned that it the side effects concern you, whatever, most mental health conditional. You can stop and it stops. - There isn't--I wouldn't worry about it. 'cause, for certain things, like I can't go off of, you know, an SSRI without weaning, - like sort of tapering down. So do everything under the... watchful eye of a healthcare professional. We are not doctors. And also, - your mileage may vary about everything. So that's why it's like... I can only speak to We both had to--we lost our licenses. Yeah, right. After the incident. Um, the... I was gonna say Just, yeah, medication is just like this big whack-a-mole thing, and so... that's always kinda And it's this--for me, I haven't ever had a medication that It was always like, &quot;this moves and I have to decide if that's worth it. - Yeah. It's like when you first... - Do you wear contacts? - I don't normally wear them. I mean, in my case, my vision not like I'm losing my sight or anything, just a little weaker over time. I've adapted to my glasses, When you put on glasses - [JARVIS] Yeah. had some severe side effects or something, you know what? I'd probably If that happens to be the case - yeah. 'cause it's like, OK, Uh, lying down is not super comfortable. Um, peripheral vision sometimes impacted. - [JORDAN] Getting bullied. is a pain in the ass. Um, your eyeball doesn't get - smudged on its own. when it says &quot;anti-glare&quot; - Right. - If you don't smudge them? - Yeah. - Or, uh-- - when you're in bed for some reason. OK, contacts--don't fall a-fucking-sleep. - You know? Yeah, or you could get Basically, there's no free lunch, right? - Um, everything's a trade-off. Uh... (laughs) yeah. I mean, there's some Um, but all that's to say, uh, I feel... good and fine right now. We've just been doing a lot. But I think I'll have maybe the coming weeks, 'cause they say this like, I might not even feel - [JORDAN] Sure, yeah. otherwise good, if a little... nervy and anxious, I think that's normal. Um, there's always like a... a crisis in Jarvistown brain, where I'm like... &quot;Is this a real crisis, trying to drum up the news, Well, yeah. Sometimes there's almost a... a cavity that forms, where the thing that was conditionally obviously the reason you were stressed or the thing you were thinking and all of a sudden, like... - The tap never stops flowing. And then your brain's like, &quot;Well, it's full up with water,&quot; which in reality is some Just natural proclivity for being worried. And then... 'cause you had a thing, And then, even if it's your brain's like, &quot;Well, And it isn't for no reason. It's just not-- There's no, like... Your brain wants evidence Sometimes it feels like You know how like it used to be and it'd be like, um, &quot;Local man saved a dog, And the president gave an address, and, uh, the elections are coming up, and don't forget to get your ballots.&quot; - [JORDAN] Yeah. you know, &quot;There was an airplane crash, and even though you have--it's more or whatever than you're now we're gonna scare you and figure out what could go wrong.&quot; Scanning through, and it's like-- You know, this is never gonna happen, but like, &quot;Boeing has resolved and then they're scrolling, like, - &quot;A guy died.&quot; &quot;That's bad, right?&quot; - Just anything. - Turns out water can kill you!&quot; And it's like, &quot;Wait, what?&quot; &quot;And chocolate's healthy, and there's a new miracle drug that's turning everyone into frogs.&quot; - And it's like... I'm like, &quot;OK, wait, what's going on?&quot; - They're just like-- NBA media is like, &quot;We've got Is it LeBron or Jordan?&quot; - Can we just chill? [JARVIS] Yeah. Maybe it's Steph Curry today. But that's my brain. Um, maybe you'll die alone? &quot;Yeah, that would be bad, I guess.&quot; &quot;OK, well, you do... OK. What if we...&quot; You know, it's like, uh, - propagandist writing. Like, &quot;Actually, everyone hates you!&quot; And they put up propaganda And you're like, &quot;Does everyone hate me, or is my brain just unemployed? I do wanna give a shoutout in the same way that-- - We saw Uncut Gems together, I feel like. - I got scared watching that. where it's a different that I never need to rewatch, but I highly recommend a movie-- I'm interested in the called, uh, All My Friends Hate Me, - That's my life story. Not all. I think Anastasia You know. Jacob legally There is this--the whole movie that meets up with all of at, like, a... - isolated Saltburn-style mansion. I won't go into the In the same way that Uncut Gems like, &quot;What's this guy doing? This is a--it's very... British. And it's just this one guy And on the car journey over, no one's laughing at his jokes. but he doesn't know why. Gets to the mansion. One person just goes, like, I think what you did was pretty And it's this... No one will say it. No one will be explicit. A lot of people aren't saying not engaging with him, not laughing. All My Friends Hate Me, yeah. It's this... So much of the way it's framed feels like, um... I guess I can only - Mm. &quot;Well, we don't say anything.&quot; - That's not how it works. What the hell? Oh, yeah. I thought that was like Tom Palmer. And Tom Stourton. - Yeah. That's literally--they could, uh, triple up with TommyInnit and they got... - (laughing) - Yeah, that's the fusion result. &quot;We are TommyInnit!&quot; (laughs) The thing they're in is, uh... a mech. I keep always wanting to - Drift-compatible friends. Shoutouts to Tommy. I hope you're well. Don't reply. Not interested. Just letting you know I hope they're good. Venmo me if that was a nice question. Uh, but otherwise... Um... (laughs) So, we do have a bunch of stuff. But one thing that I think would be fun is to have a little mail bag, because people don't know that I and we have a PO Box. Uh, we'll put the address on the screen. But you can feel free to send us stuff. We do get letters. We do get little gifts here and there. In the description In the description as well. And I do think it's or maybe that's just But anyway, we'll put it in there. And we'll put it in the presets Um, this is not... We got a thing today, and this isn't a way so if you have a business, Um, 'cause we will be doing regular ads Yeah, don't send us a sweet, cute, sincere-looking package But we got these hoodies today. - Jordan's wearing his. and this blessing was here. - Um, it's cute. Here's what it looks like &quot;Good things are coming.&quot; If you're concerned about it This is from, uh, Peripheral US, It says, &quot;Hey, Sad Boyz. Big fans. I design earrings, but Hope you both like it.&quot; Uh, and that's from Aimee and Carlos. And they've been huge fans for a while, and they say &quot;thank you - Thank you for the hoodie. I thought that was sweet, We were just discussing something to put the stickers on. Oh, yeah. What do you--yeah. Let us know what you Water bottles, laptops. I used to be a big laptop sticker guy. I feel like the tech was the equivalent of, - Guitar stickers. Loading them up on like from so much stickers on it. All right, so we've got so maybe we can run through... those. Uh, first is... Have you seen any of the Sonic movies? I saw the first one, uh, 'cause everyone was so excited at the - Mmhmm. Did I get COVID? - [JARVIS] Oh, no! I was in London. It was I was about to hop on a train, and this was the 28 Days Later period. It was like somebody heard about COVID, but we didn't know if it We're like, &quot;There's two illnesses? One's like SARS; one's legit, blah-blah?&quot; And then it's all just a scam, and then the super-spreader event, - We all go in to see the movie. - And that was the virus. Get away. Uh, and we really didn't A lot of people coughing in the theater. - Oh, NO. Is that, like, I was gonna say, which is so rude or whatever, and I'm like, to go to a public place and cough. But people might not remember, at least... a lot less so... It wasn't like a pariah thing. You didn't see it and go, &quot;Are you insane? - You could have COVID!&quot; &quot;Well, I'm glad I'm not sat next to him.&quot; &quot;That'd be a bit weird.&quot; - three seats away, I'm all good. when I went to Japan for the first time and there were people wearing masks, I thought that something was wrong. And then I realized - I'm like, &quot;Makes sense.&quot; Censorship 'cause you You can't hear their statements from it. I haven't seen the Sonic movies, - Um, and... - Is...? - but it just got announced. There's a lot of things--so, Uh, I'll say in a second, But I do intend to watch them. And... I love Sonic. It was the I have a lot of history with it. And specifically, I have history - [JORDAN] Mmhmm. Your Chao still lives here. Ugh, my Chaos. - My beautiful Chao Garden. - I'll say that. That was like Pokemon to me for that era, - was my Chao Garden. for giving resources to my Chaos. Yeah, it kinda makes me wanna play just a Chao Garden or something, Kinda remarkable that that IP has not been given some kinda iOS release, where it is just that part. - Yeah. Especially nostalgia, 'cause now are the spending demographic. - Mmhmm. spends game on-- - If they're smart. notable things about is that--uh, released in 2001. It was the... debut of Shadow the Hedgehog. And Shadow the Hedgehog - [JORDAN] Nice. - as to who's playing Shadow? - That's right. - Uh, who's playing Shadow? Think Idris Elba-level of... of star power. Level. I mean, we're talking like A-list. Is the, uh, vocal performance... similar to legit Shadow? (deep voice) It's the same kinda... - Could be. We don't know. [JARVIS] We don't know yet. &quot;Look at my gun&quot; is very important-- I think very important to who you answer. &quot;I've got this gun.&quot; Ohhhhh, man. - OK, who's--? - Who's huge right--? it could possibly be. - Who's a big star. - that wrote All My Friends Hate Me. It's not me. Is it not me? - Well... could be. I can do my voice! &quot;Hey, - Oh. - &quot;Six-shooter!&quot; - OK. - Mm, close. - Pew-pew! - Yeah, OK. Uh, OK. - Can I get a couple questions? Have they appeared in a Marvel movie? Great question. I don't believe so. - Are they-- I haven't seen them all. - Are they over the age of 40? Have they appeared in - Not in recent years. - Yeah. - (laughs) is more their vibe. Is... (laughing) All I can - That's so funny. - That would be funny. Uh... No. Keanu Reeves. (gasps) Oh, what am I thinking?! - Of course. - It's fucking Shadow and his glock - voiced by Keanu Reeves. I'm so stoked. - Is he doing the John Wick voice? I don't think we've seen anything What if Shadow's wearing Dude. I, um... He's very Wick-coded, actually. I know! That's what I was thinking! 'Cause Shadow is the, like, John Wick of-- He's the antihero that's like... He's not evil. He's misunderstood. - He's the Vegeta. That's what I said to Anastasia yesterday. I was telling her about Shadow. I said, &quot;He's the Vegeta to Sonic's Goku.&quot; - Um, but... but also... But also, um, the funniest thing is that... Sonic was always, you know... Sonic is the... Sega mascot the way - Sega does what Nintendon't. because I was gonna talk about And so... And so Sonic's edgy. He's cool. He's got cool shoes. (laughing) He does go really fucking fast. - Too fast. It's like Freddy Fast-bear. Shadow, like... Shadow in-- I don't remember if Shadow - Adventure 2. I think there's blasters and bombs But I don't remember guns. But then the Xbox-exclusive Shadow the Hedgehog game prominently featured his fucking glock. A huuuuuge-- Like, too big for the humans, which it also did feature - photorealistic people. Was it Sonic or Shadow who was in - Both. And the only thing I remember about which also featured Shadow, he had--she was like a princess, - and she was under the age of 18. It was--which maybe-- Look up &quot;Sonic age.&quot; Which will put into question &quot;I'm a guy!&quot; - &quot;I'm a guy! Let's go fast!&quot; - (laughing) Is Sonic canonically--?! No. - No, that's the age of the IP. - He wasn't one years old. &quot;Sonic is still 15, - Someone's mad about that. (laughing) That's a huge amount! [JARVIS] That's so funny. Hold on. Did the, uh-- Did the creator of Sonic go to jail? Can you type in &quot;Yuji Naka jail&quot;? - Yeahhh. Yeah. Yuji Naka, uh-- &quot;Suspended prison sentence, &quot;Found guilty of insider trading - So, white-collar crime. Who hasn't done a little - Nancy?! Pelosi? What if the comment is - &quot;I didn't, actually.&quot; - Gotta earn fast. 'cause they couldn't catch him. &quot;He's going to fast! - [JARVIS] Um... - I could do that. I do love how we could just 'cause I was not planning to talk going to jail for insider Um, Anastasia, do you have something? [STAZ] I was just gonna say relief in being like, &quot;Oh, - it's not murder or sex crimes.&quot; He was just rolling around I mean, nowadays, you're like, Like, this isn't even cancel-worthy. &quot;You hear Yuji Naka got canceled?&quot; &quot;Insider trading.&quot; - [JORDAN] &quot;Cool. Badass.&quot; - &quot;That's actually sick.&quot; - Trump at Gettysburg? [JARVIS] It was a joke. - Oh, I didn't see it, no. Do we--is that something Yes, if only because he, uh... Yeah, the only thing I'll spoil that General Lee has been Why does that give me deja vu? - [JORDAN] Well, you said it. - It reminds me of when-- - Oh, yeah, that's 2018. Oh, when he acts like - (laughs) He's the best. - Yeah, it's that one. - &quot;Don't know him.&quot; &quot;He's cool.&quot; Featured a pirate impression? - Yeah, that's what I was... Maybe I did. &quot;Trump goes on a weird rant then notes that Robert E. Lee, - &quot;Did you ever notice that?&quot; That is a really funny Trumpism, where he acts like he's the first - &quot;The Confederacy lost.&quot; acting like you're the first to is wild. He is like one of those Twitch streamers that says the N-word - Yeah. &quot;Did anybody notice?&quot; Wait, can you--? 'Cause he's like, &quot;I said...&quot; I can't do Trump, of course, but &quot;I said--&quot; Fuck, why is it even worse today? &quot;They never talk about him.&quot; - [JORDAN] Oh, yeah. Fuck it, let's just play the clip. <i>...where our union was saved</i> <i>by the immortal <i>Gettysburg, what an unbelievable...</i> <i>battle that was, - &quot;I was there.&quot; <i>I mean, it was so much <i>and so vicious and horrible,</i> <i>and so beautiful in - <i>It represented such a big portion</i> - <i>of the success of this country.</i> <i>Gettysburg, wow.</i> (both laughing) - Wait, go back? [STAZ] It sounds like - Always. He has actually some - that I think is... <i>...portion of the success of this country.</i> <i>Gettysburg, wow.</i> <i>I go to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania <i>And the statement of Robert E. Lee,</i> <i>who's no longer in favor-- - &quot;Did you ever notice that?&quot; - Wait a second. Is this--? of Mike Lindell made it Wait, was this Newsmax Why is this on-- Why is MyPillow sponsoring this? - &quot;RSBN&quot;? - Huge. Mike Lindell is, yeah. &quot;Promo code RSBN.&quot; The Ruth Bader... - Ruth's Bader. - &quot;Right Side Broadcasting,&quot; Jesus Christ. - AI-generated. There is, uh--I just love... &quot;I went to watch and to look.&quot; - (laughs) There's something, like-- - Isn't that poetic? That's like, uh, not the way people speak, but there's something - &quot;I both watched and could look.&quot; I've never described it this way. I feel like I'm watching someone-- When I watch him speak, mid-Guitar Hero solo. Where he's, like, not... He's not sure if he's gonna hit the note, and he just lands it Every now and again, activates Star Power, - Yeah, he's played it like twice before. the balance board, but he keeps-- stays afloat, and everyone's going, &quot;Oh? Oh? Oh? No, he got it. He's back. - He's still technically making sense.&quot; - [JARVIS] Yeah. when he says 20 adjectives - That are conflicting. - Yeah, how do you-- The danger zone. That's like where, 'Cause he always does three. And so he'll go, &quot;It was bad, It's like he's doing crowd work; the audience's opinion about something. &quot;It was a good battle. We don't like it. - We... do.&quot; &quot;And he's fallen out of favor, (laughs) &quot;Uh... but not.&quot; - &quot;It's good that he's out of favor?&quot; He was a misunderstood, - I wish him the best.&quot; &quot;He called me yesterday; &quot;He said, 'Hello!'&quot; (both laughing) &quot;'Guess who lost.'&quot; OK, so something was unearthed recently. Uh, so... OK. I'm gonna set the stage. Are you familiar with The Decision? I think we might've touched on it, but at least on the pod about... It's... the... LeBron's decision of whether he remains - with his hometown team, or... - moves to... So, he was gonna move, So, LeBron was drafted in like 2003 He independently is an incredible player, but the team was horrible without him. That's why they got the #1 draft pick. And then while he was able to he didn't have enough help, 'cause, you know, He basically--they just didn't have And LeBron's getting up there. Like Michael Jordan, for example, until his seventh season anyway. Uh, so it's like LeBron's and he's like, &quot;Oh, my clock is ticking. I wanna, like... win.&quot; So he announces that he's gonna... [STAZ] And his contract It was up. And so this ushers in this of players trying to choose but LeBron had all of the... He was a free agent. And he had a TV special that was supposed to be funding but everyone clowned on him for it It was an hour-long TV special, retrospective on LeBron's career LeBron's now in year 21. At this point in time, and huge star in sports in general, has all of the decision-making power. And every team wants him. - So it starts a crazy courting process, where every team He's taking general meetings and stuff where he's meeting with the board, they're presenting him with-- He's meeting with and they're pulling out because it's gonna be a - the marketability of their team. - Um... to go and see a team Look, Caitlin Clark just got drafted to the Indiana Fever, sold out all of her jerseys immediately. The, uh... The presales for their games are taking off like wildfire. And so that is the star power gravity that someone like There was a legend. I heard this, like--'cause for a lot longer than like watching all the - and stuff. But the... There was a legend that pitched LeBron... they got... some of the cast of the Sopranos... to record a... secret, like, Sopranos episode about LeBron. Like a--after the show [STAZ] Yeah, it was like a, &quot;Oh, one more bonus episode.&quot; If there's one thing I know - it is The Sopranos. So that's why we've [STAZ] Yeah, we weren't - Exactly. - are you talkin' about?&quot; the context of this. But... On this podcast, they played a few seconds of... what is a 30-minute thing. I don't know the full... [STAZ] So, this was and it just recently leaked. Oh, as in--? Wait. So, this leaked this week. The thing was made in 2010? - [STAZ] It was made in 2010. [STAZ] And for years, It was a legend, but it sounds insane. - Yeah. It sounds an urban legend - that you'd see in an iceberg video. When did Gandolfini die? - [JORDAN] A little after this? [STAZ] He definitely was alive in 2010. - &quot;I made a secret episode.&quot; has a basketball podcast, and he... got a copy of this somehow. Wait, is the show called Pablo Finds Out? - [STAZ] Oh, maybe. Yeah, Pablo Torre Finds Out. [STAZ] And, uh, Just this bit of it. - [STAZ] So let's watch it. <i>Let me just ask, <i>- About 10 minutes. <i>- (laughing) <i>They made LeBron <i>- For 10 minutes?! <i>- All right. <i>They have one chance</i> <i>to convince the most <i>in the history of sports <i>that desperately, desperately...</i> <i>could use exactly that.</i> <i>And they walk into the room <i>They press play on a video,</i> - <i>and it starts like this.</i> - Which team is pushing this? - OK, at least that makes sense. (laughs) - Is there any--<i> <i>Tony, I'm so glad <i>- Life is so much better now. <i>Life's good here, Carm.</i> <i>Even if you are in <i>Now we just gotta find a place <i>- What's he like? <i>But he respects tradition.</i> <i>Here's something classy on the East Side.</i> <i>Well, is it big enough?</i> <i>He's gonna be entertaining <i>It's very expensive.</i> <i>Oh, that's not gonna be a problem.</i> <i>You gotta find something... magnificent.</i> <i>Something there's nothing in the world - <i>Oh, here's a place.</i> <i>Says it gets really Sexy. Cool. - <i>Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's it.</i> <i>That's gonna be perfect for him.</i> <i> Allow me to reintroduce myself I just have to say James Gandolfini is... in my opinion, amongst... maybe the... 10 greatest performers And getting him to - is so funny. It's so funny. And then him turning he could not possibly be reading. [STAZ] I feel like they probably-- [STAZ] I mean, they [STAZ] They were looking at I mean, if there's one thing it's the fact that Tony is... literally doing anything other than hiring to shoot That's all--the two biggest events that happen regarding is he hires them to kill people and he calls his daughter's - [STAZ] Oh my God. Like &quot;A finook! A skalooki!&quot; [STAZ] But shoutout to the - WorldWideWob and Jason Concepcion. Oh, OK. I follow WorldWideWob. - 'Cause that's anti-Italian. [STAZ] Rob is, uh... - just a big NBA Twitter guy. - I follow them. moments after something crazy happens, - he has a clip of it on Twitter. - [STAZ] Very good follow. Always during a game, [STAZ] Also, he took Lakers owner - and everyone freaked out about it. Jeanie Buss? - Yeah. was a Lakers owner as well. - [STAZ] All the Buss kids now. - Then she got into it. There's a very funny, um-- There's a very funny clip of It's like her-- - She's in her 60s, or something? And someone else--I can't remember... who was next to her, but LeBron is, like, talking about how they're the most power-- They've done lip-reading of this. Because it's too far away &quot;You're some of the most They're like, &quot;Happy International They're like, &quot;Aw,&quot; and it went very viral. Hugging on him, Woke up this morning, - got myself LeBron. has since passed. And... [STAZ] I hate that his legacy No, dude, his legacy is him in that photo where he's drunkly - of a SpongeBob SquarePants mascot. - [STAZ] I've never seen that. People went, &quot;It's disrespectful.&quot; Have we talked about... Anthony Davis being in - Maybe. that I did on a Patreon. Oh, yeah, like on the jet-ski? - [STAZ] Yeah. but the reason is I think you then referenced - in the SpongeBob movie. - [JACOB] I think I did. No. (laughs) No, somebody's trying to get more money. We gotta keep it moving. - Um... Uh, keep the good times rolling. Uh, another thing we wanted to talk about-- This'll be quick. Um... Let's pull up the Spider-Man NPC. You know the guy who is Miles Morales? Yeah, vaguely. I don't know his actual creator name. - @leaks._.world, OK. &quot;Thanks for the rose! Smells great!&quot; Yeah, exactly. Do we have-- - Jacob, do you wanna just take it away? I don't think the industry at large is, but this guy's killing it. - [JACOB] NPC stuff? [JACOB] It kind of is. but recently Pinkydoll, - the original NPC Live creator-- - &quot;Ice cream so good&quot;? upset because everyone, like, - copied her style or something. - like mukbangs and stuff. Isn't she French Canadian I remember she stopped doing the voice, - I'm like, &quot;Whoa.&quot; She was like, &quot;Ice cream so good! [STAZ] Oh, I remember that. [STAZ] Someone walked in, - Yeah. [JACOB] So, yeah. This is NPC [JACOB] Um, this one is where he, like... uh, is doing this-- [JACOB] I'm not sure where exactly it is, but some sort of security guard - or police officer comes up to him and is trying to get him - Yeah. <i>- Thanks for the follow. <i>[GUARD] My command <i>No, I'mma do my own thing.</i> - (both laughing)<i> <i>- Nah. <i>- I'mma do my own thing. <i>[GUARD] Yeah, he's already <i>- [GUARD] Might as well-- <i>You're gonna give me a stomachache.</i> <i>Those smell amazing.

I'mma do my own thing.&quot; - &quot;You're starting to piss me off.&quot; - [STAZ] It seems like a bad idea. [STAZ] Why would you do it outside? I think for the... - He's gonna do his own thing. uh, the, um... what's the word? - Like, anything can happen. I think, I mean, with great power, (laughs) Or whatever. I don't Is this next one when [JACOB] Yeah, there's a couple [JORDAN] That's cute. - [JORDAN] It's fun! We should do this! like every time. <i>Fuck these galaxies, man!</i> <i>Y'all niggas wilding, bro.</i> <i>Hell nah.</i> Oh, he's fully out of character. <i>Fuck!</i> I guess 'cause the galaxies pulls him He's sweating. <i>Get to a million likes, bro. <i>Get to a million likes.

Is that the--? Yeah, I think it's this one. &quot;No one was sending Do you want them or not? <i>There's 11,000 people in here.</i> <i>There's 11,000 <i>and you guys are not <i>Make sure you're tapping the screen. <i>There's 11,000 fucking - How many? <i>Tap the goddamn screen. OK, <i>Press the fucking button. - OK, Miles. &quot;Peter!&quot; - <i>Thanks for the follow--</i> [STAZ] It's so jarring when he goes back! It's so jarring OK, so that was what I saw, People were clowning on him, I also don't know how old this kid is. He can't be more than like 22. - 23, right? Wait, is that an interview he did? <i>When you get requests on Live,</i> <i>are they ever sexual, <i>'Cause I see a lot - <i>Is this weird?</i> <i>- (laughs) That's wild. <i>'cause if you watch <i>It wasn't just one, <i>It'll be like, &quot;Ooh, a glizzy!

Bro, - <i>I'm scrolling through TikTok one day.</i> All right, this isn't gonna help. Yeah, so I don't know. I... But I am like... It seems so tiring. (laughs) So I hope he's having fun. I hope he hasn't done anything bad. Uh, but I just think it's so funny. Oh, OK, let's watch this last one, <i>[OFF-SCREEN] Holy shit! - <i>[OFF-SCREEN] Shit, this is a nice car. <i>[OFF-SCREEN] Oh my...</i> Is he doing the streams daily? 'Cause otherwise, - being his car. - [STAZ] I hope that's not his car. - [STAZ] And he's saving some money. - Candy purple Lambo? I don't know. Those cars are so expensive, - and I don't know the financial situation, but... [STAZ] Even leasing, people that I've heard about leasing very expensive sports cars - after being successful online. [STAZ] And even very expensive every month. Yeah. Now I feel like an idiot, Now it's like, &quot;Oh, right.&quot; - &quot;Fuck.&quot; every time they - I really... that I just don't understand, &quot;Why aren't you tapping the screen? - God, it's-- I... It would be... very smart bait. - [JARVIS] Mmhmm. 'Cause we've also seen this on Twitch, which are more obviously bait, - where people are just like... &quot;Oh, that upsets me so much, what you just said with your $20 donation! I hope nobody else does text-to-speech - with a $15 minimum! Arrrrrgh!&quot; [STAZ] He seems very genuine - I know! It's so impressive. - [STAZ] You know, they go viral. [STAZ] And people probably - check him out more after these. Like, if he was doing a fake one, even if people would still watch it. Like, people would be so in on that. - Right? Am I crazy? How long until someone creates a really convincing AI version of this that can work infinitely? Oh, do as many backflips-- - It gets tired. It gets pissed off. - The cops come. They add extra environment events. [JACOB] Something that is they will do, like... - uh, AI-generated looping videos of... like a face-cam of someone gaming. [JACOB] And then - like, gameplay, - and do it on TikTok Live, so it's like a self... That's interesting. And his was like - a little bit more robust, but-- Mm, I'm gonna do my own thing. (as Kwebbelkop) &quot;I'm going - All right, what else we got? That's what happened to PewDiePie. - He did his own thing? - But he got blamed. (laughs) &quot;N--&quot; - &quot;I'm gonna say my own thing.&quot; Jordan, you have a huge announcement! I have a huge announcement. Um, just came on right before the podcast. - I have two huge announcements. I don't mean to brag. I have been... pre-selected by PayPal (laughing) OK, congrats. That's huge. Not a lot of people get selected randomly. Well, I didn't get it. I got a kind of notification that I could apply for it. Mmhmm, OK. That's a little bit I guess someone's got a PayPal account Also, PayPal has like... like 2,000 of my dollars, - [JARVIS] Oh, really? back and forth from the UK-- I forget. It's been like two years. 'Cause they do this; somebody pushes back, 'cause - [JARVIS] Yeah. That's the one thing - (Staz laughing) - They based Tony Stark on him. But I will say something really nice did happen, of Slime saying he had a - [JARVIS] Awww. if not for his transparency and openness, I would be too nervous to say it, but I really like you, Slime. - That was chill. We just had like a-- He Irish goodbyed. He was at the party But in the 30 minutes we were chilling... - We never met before. with such a tough exterior. - He's like a... What's something that's really hard - Like a croissant. - Yeah, a falafel. Slime is like a falafel. Very eclectic choice. Very well-traveled. - Yeah, very vegetarian of you. Yeah, that's true. - A half-Greek vegetarian over here. Yeah, for me, I'll go with a cup of tea. - The mug is hard. - And he has like an open top. (both chomping) Um... - Yeah, shoutouts, Slime. That was nice. - We should get him on at some point. - OK. We should get--I hope on he just goes, &quot;Psych, dude! The last shoutout him saying that he wasn't - (laughing) Oh, yeah, I forgot. And then he was like, &quot;Oh, my B.&quot; - I'm like, &quot;Too late, buddy.&quot; &quot;You already roasted &quot;It's over, pal.&quot; And I'm gonna get you - Ayyy. - Oh. But it's mine. We don't have a plan yet. - We don't. - It's coming up. - [STAZ] Yeah! I've started mentally preparing. I don't like birthdays. I mean, I enjoy the celebration, sure, - but I don't like the getting old. I don't want the focal point to be too... That's what's nice Yeah, it's like we're twins. [STAZ] That is actually really nice. I... [STAZ] It's fun to see your friends but it's like, &quot;I don't want - Yeah. at opening gifts in front of people. [STAZ] Don't do it. Jesus. (laughs) - [STAZ] Do it later. - [STAZ] Yeah. - I like gifts. I'm just like... Oh, yeah. But it means and I can't ever communicate how much it means to be thought of and, like, receive something from 'Cause it's on the Crying is the 10. - [JARVIS] Mmhmm. &quot;Yay!&quot; but that's not the right... - That's not how I'm feeling. is the vibe. [STAZ] I just don't wanna be Right. Speaking of being - Elon Musk... Um, uh... - Cute. Epic. - Oh my God, what is this? Wait, we have to find the original. - Oh, of him just hanging out? - No. Yeah, I touch grass, Anastasia. - Uh... Wait, maybe Twitter. He's at some--the Breakthrough Prize. - (snorts) <i>Throw the arms in the air!</i> - <i>Throw the arms in the air! - <i>Elon! - <i>Elon, to your left!</i> - <i>Elon, fighting pose! OK. Just doing emotional poses. Posing like mo-cap. <i>(photographers all yelling)</i> <i>- To your left! To your left!</i> <i>- Elon!</i> - <i>Elon, can we get you down here, please? He keeps, on instinct, he did in the photo with Epstein. [STAZ] You know, I just realized - he kinda reminds me of Austin Powers. By the way, mismatched pants I know you can do it with a tuxedo, But before we make fun of Elon Musk, I have to say he tweeted, um, an anti-vax meme recently. - We were talking about COVID. And, uh, I really don't like him. (laughs) Epic win, dude. Very topical. There's lots of reasons you could and I think that Elon Musk &quot;What happened to the variants?&quot; So, some of these-- OK, now we can go back to the... Show him the Fortnite one first. (laughing) That's really good. - God, that's smart. - He does it again. The radial menu gets me. This is toxic playing, dude. - This is, like, disrespectful. I'm not gonna put what about a--whoa! That's great. &quot;IDK!&quot; How about that in the lobby, where you have 3 other people there? And he's just throwing them out. And then there's a Sims one as well. (laughing) Every time I think I don't like him, - he's just awesome. So epic. - He's been studying these emotionals. 'Cause the menswear guy I didn't see him noting so I thought it was just the lighting. - But they look different to me, too. - Oh my God. It's the texture. One's glossy. His pants are more matte, - [JARVIS] It's tough. contrast pants, no problem. But there has to be contrast. You do not wear blue... unless it's extremely--no, not even light. You can pull it off, for sure, - but it has to feel more intentional. It feels like your black pants were dirty, so you wore the navy ones, It feels like you bought them Like, &quot;I need new pants!&quot; [JARVIS] Um... OK, I just needed to get that one off, [STAZ] It does truly feel like he's like, - People are yelling at him to do things. - other people don't listen to them. - Yeah. Yeah, literally. &quot;Do the jerk!&quot; - &quot;T-pose!&quot; - That initial Y pose he did-- (laughing) &quot;Handstand.&quot; His VTuber accidentally disconnected. That's why the Y-pose happens for a sec. Yeah, he T-poses accidentally. - Um... like, Talladega Nights, &quot;I don't know what to do with my hands.&quot; - Um... I--you-- There's a kind of reverse uncanny valley, - [JARVIS] Mmhmm. Actually, not even uncanny valley. and you start at the base of it and you... as... age and money accrue, or experience and-- for these kinda shows, I mean. It's always younger people but they're very well dressed, and then as the income and the more resources they have, the increase of swag. - And then there is this steep drop-off, where Bezos has too much money - and looks like shit. Like, something happens. They start paying someone who's like-- Weirdly, Zuckerberg has started and everybody's like, &quot;What's going on?&quot; It's 'cause he's doing jiu-jitsu, dude. He's around real people, and it's like you can't... You can't have that &quot;tech guy&quot; veneer. You've gotta just be a normal person. - Yeah, he's dressing like he's in MMA. Um... Uh, again, it's like I always... (chuckling) Just making fun of people Another thing about Elon - is clearly seeking adoration and fame. You know? And these are--it's documented. Like, and it's, uh... - clear in his actions. You know that, like... I don't really agree but, like, uh... There's a certain salary or income where your happiness doesn't OK. If you... Let's just say it's $250,000. As soon as you make over $250,000, It's like, well, it depends and how much, and If you have $5 million $260,000 does feel better. But people are talking like if the accrual of money, if that's like a ego thing you have. But the exact opposite is true. If, like, you do get more miserable, it seems like, once you have more money there is a sudden drop-off where you need approval It's like if you have really, 'cause you know everyone knows, and you have to be like... What he could do is just be a hero. He could, like, fix the world. But instead he's like, &quot;Hey, - &quot;Does anyone like that?&quot; he shouldn't have upset - Mmhmm. [STAZ] Maybe the love of your family's than the love of guys on Twitter. - Or disowning your trans child. Pretending that, like, - or refusing to speak on... - to your children. &quot;virtue signaling&quot; because it's always attributed to a particular side of the It's always, &quot;That's such a lib, to pretend you believe in certain When in reality it's like, He's just doing it with The iconography of is appealing to the wrong demo, man. If you wanna be approved of... by people with, you know... lives and not just posters... It can be insincere. Whatever. Just advocate for free healthcare. Hey, you can, uh... secretly, behind the scenes, Fund things against it. - But just say it. Just be... You will be way more approved of by being the cool billionaire than you ever will be by being the, uh... alt-right voice for blue-checks. Wow. Whoa! - This is kinda uncanny. Whoooa, what the hell?! Maybe he loves the Sims. - He is a gamer. - Ohhhhh! Was there an emote where he, like, invests too much money - Yeah. creepy. (laughs) Uh, I mean, he's not allowed to play it. I literally think he would benefit so much from just being kind of Well, he suffers from JK Rowling disease, where if you would just shut up, you And then, of course, cancel culture - I don't even know who JK Rowling is. - Harry Potter's like a dog, or something? Is that like a... - Is that like Hunger Games? What did you--you had [JORDAN] Yeah, I... walked through the door. I haven't used TikTok for months. - I just forget that it's there. And I'm scared of you-know-who. (chuckles) A certain type of people. I saw that and I almost spit out-- I saw something on a slide. I'm not ready. It is, um... (sighs) I think we can watch one, and then I'll elaborate, It's, um, one of the more unsettling - AI-generated TikToks I've seen. The general, uh... - They all share a premise. And it is, uh... They're pretty popular. I'm gonna close my eyes, and Jacob, let me know when it's queued up. - 'Cause it's a surprise. - &quot;the one&quot;? Let me know when we're ready, - [JORDAN] Here we go. - Let it rip. Ugh! What?! (laughing) (laughs) &quot;Hear-ed.&quot; &quot;Cleans-ing.&quot; &quot;How-e-vair&quot;?! How did--? What?! Right. So, in this universe... - In this universe-- - Stewie's telling his life story. Stew James is telling his life story as this baby still? - Like, he's still a tiny baby. I also love that, uh... I mean... Not to be all... &quot;um, actually.&quot; But they can't understand Stewie. (laughs) In fact, those two that don't know what Stewie is saying. Well, maybe they're hearing voices, No, but he said they - The exorcism worked. - This is... Like, wha...? I'm trying to understand how you even... Like, you're in the lab. You're like, &quot;I'm trying to cook up - the next viral sensation.&quot; And you go, &quot;The true story--&quot; &quot;The true, realistic historical record of cartoon characters.&quot; It's just so unsettling. I mean, the prompt for all of these has to just be in the vein of, like... Like, typing in, um, &quot;Give me a story about the original person that Phineas and Ferb were based on, - except it's sad and scary.&quot; to when he found out he had Yeah, did Stewie tell them or something? Like... wait, yeah. That guy and that guy are two different generations of-- Was the guy doing the IQ test Stewie? Yeah, I think maybe Right. 'Cause that looks like you said, &quot;Hey, a cartoon character. - Make him look like a real person.&quot; Yeah, and it looks like 'Cause this is the problem You can't, like... With-- (laughs) It's really hard to say [JORDAN] Yeah. The same character, but... Oh, dude, I was... I was trying to see what, uh... we could generate up as profile pictures for the character Katie And I just put in the description, and the guy came out too handsome. So I typed in, to see what happened, &quot;same guy, but less handsome.&quot; And it generated a similar-ish image, but it removed his nose. (laughs) - [JARVIS] That's so funny. &quot;OK, yeah, I guess OK, we can keep it rolling. &quot;Only to learn that I have - [JORDAN] Peter with his moped. &quot;So, uh, Lois, I love my moped!&quot; &quot;Peter, I'm a stay-at-home mom &quot;I'm always--&quot; yeah, - Yeah, dude. The thing that is also is that it pronounces out of nowhere. Usually it's pretty good. - Yeah. I'm wondering if it's on purpose. Yeah. &quot;Became distant.&quot; Oh--! OK. Now you do. Oh, he's old now. (laughs) They're still alive, by the way. Those are all, like--that's like the-- Yeah, again, the problem with they're all fucking different versions of Stewie. OK. Can I just say, Who's different every time also. But like way more impressive - than really anybody else. But then there's that - and goes to conventions. Ethan and Nick got me - [JARVIS] Oh, that's fun. &quot;M'yeah, Jordan, I heard Uh, the b-b-b-bir--&quot; - He just is doing bits. - b-b-bird's the word.&quot; (both laughing) <i>Real-life Peter Griffin here <i>from your friend Ethan. <i>about how to deal with <i>But to be honest, I either <i>But when my back is up against <i>I fall back on the fact that b-b-b-bird, <i>well, bird, bird, bird, <i>Well, don't you <i>Well, Peter's here <i>B-b-b-bird, bird, b-bird's the word. <i>(laughs) Shut up, Meg!</i> - Wherever it is. &quot;Shut up, Meg.&quot; It's sat on the desktop - &quot;Shut up, Jordan.&quot; - &quot;Shut up, Meg.&quot; &quot;'Ey, shut up, Meg! Whoa!&quot; &quot;Giggity! Hey, Peter!&quot; (chuckles) - &quot;Hey, Peter. Shut up, Meg.&quot; &quot;I promised Loretta &quot;I'm played by a white guy.&quot; - &quot;It's kinda messed up.&quot; &quot;But the Cleveland Show? How many of those voice actors &quot;What if my son was played by-- So there's a baby that talks, - &quot;It's Black Stewie.&quot; that's a nerd at school, and a character that's - &quot;Remember The Boondocks?&quot; &quot;What if my baby was like one of the kids - from The Boondocks?&quot; (laughs) Um... Uh, which is funny, because normally that would be but it's a white guy doing a and we're making a joke about Fun times. I'm a genius. - Um... OK, wait, can we go back (sighs) &quot;#familyguy, - #scarystories, #scarytiktoks, #urbanlegend.&quot; - The urban legend of Stewie Griffin! (laughing) It says &quot;horrortok&quot; twice! Um, yeah, if I didn't-- If they say it a third time, Oh, be careful! &quot;Creator labeled as AI-generated.&quot; - How many-- off Rex Harrison.&quot; - Who the... what? - Ooh, not bad. Wow, this is crazy. So this is like real AI-generated content that's getting genuine engagement. That was another thing is this is actually one of the few times where that, uh... &quot;It'll just generate content I'm like, look, I don't know how to... attribute the different things AI has to adopt interesting content, I'm not particularly bothered. But this works. Like, this is just as good any of the &quot;horrortoks&quot; that are like, &quot;Jeff the Killer actually married my dad!&quot; &quot;Where do people Seth's told us these characters He was barely alive OK, so they're disputing it. See, that's the thing! It's like... When I see this, I don't like, from a factual standpoint, &quot;Erm, actually, SpongeBob didn't exist.&quot; - &quot;It sounds true, but it's made-up.&quot; Wow. Wait, Stewie's actually called &quot;Larry, Larry, and Steve.&quot; OK. Why not tell that story? - Oh, 'cause it's not scary. old short that Family Guy is... I think it's called &quot;Larry and Steve.&quot; Wait, can you type in &quot;Larry and Steve&quot;? There's like a-- When Seth MacFarlane - Yeah. It's-- Yeah, it's just Larry &amp; Steve. I mean, yeah it looks like Peter and... - Yeah, and he's got Peter's voice. &quot;The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve.&quot; Oh. Oh, no, this is two different things. Oh, so you know what's funny? This person probably read the 'Cause this is a joint Wikipedia page for two animated short films created by Seth MacFarlane That's so funny. I mean, yeah, it's based - I don't even know-- You might not have had that, They used to show old And then they would do stuff like this, But I don't think Seth MacFarlane like real ones. And-- He pwned, uh... - Bill Maher in a debate. Well, I was gonna say Seth MacFarlane recently had a quote about, uh... They were like, if he's and he was like, &quot;People still enjoy it.&quot; &quot;So we'll keep making it.&quot; - [JORDAN] Fair enough. And he makes other stuff, so... And he does other stuff, yeah. &quot;The Orlando,&quot; or something? - [JARVIS] The Orville? Yeah. I mean, I've always been And I'm glad that, you know, in a time when all of my... heroes have fallen, uh, because - [JORDAN] Yeah. I don't feel like those hours I spent listening to the Family where they talk about - [JORDAN] &quot;This guy's charming.&quot; - an auteur. He's so talented.&quot; Frank Sina--like, I didn't know - [JARVIS] Yeah. OK. So... We are... Now I'll fucking describe - what this is, OK? I've seen the hashtags. - We're on horrortok, my guy! These are horror stories. These are TikToks... Wait, no. Sorry. Um, &quot;Follow to get I--check it out. I know a way to get Oh, no! Jacob, folloooooow! If you just click on the-- If you just fucking click - I'm not a computer engineer, dude. - Nooo. - about your origin. Did you know about Brian the dog?&quot; (laughs) &quot;It's based on, &quot;Hi, I'm Brian the dog.&quot; Dude, I wish my IQ was high enough All right, so--I know, with teaching a dog how to talk It's possible. - Um... - So... Uh, I think it's obvious, the one we have to watch. - &quot;Shrek Origins&quot;? I assume that's in the It's him with Will.i.am and Hugh Jackman. Right, Eddie Murphy's there. I love this. Am I--? Yeah, Will.i.am is in - Wait, wait, pause? - Can we go back to the very beginning? - I found a flaw. So... So, the AI that they're which is not good, uh, obviously doesn't recognize Shrek's ears. So they've created a image with Shrek's ears, and then the face is completely so his head keeps moving - while his ears stay in the same place. Well, that's 'cause you can't [JACOB] That's what Yeah, come on. None of [STAZ] Do you think (laughing) Dude has a All right, let's play. Oh, that's so funny. Hello! - You been there? Sunny City sounds like cap to me. Can we Google whether or not - Is it like Gotham? - kind of spot-on for a city in Florida. - [Sun] City Center. Sun City Center. Oh, it is a-- &quot;Sun City Center is an unincorporated census-designated place.&quot; - OK, well... I can see how the AI [STAZ] Is Meyer Myshalls - Michael Myers? It's a anagram for [JACOB] Probably the, uh... [JACOB] Whatever AI just, like, associated it with it. - Yeah, &quot;Shrek is played by Mike Myers.&quot; - Yeah, Stew Jones or whatever. - Stew James. &quot;My creator. I taught the dog, - B-ryan, to talk.&quot; &quot;And he was like, 'Oh, hello. I guess you're smart &quot;I recognize you have (both laughing) &quot;Scanning. Onions detected.&quot; &quot;Despite selling onions Jesus, why's he wearing skinny jeans? Yeah, bro. Maybe that was Why does it look like... Why does it look like It looks like he's wearing a onesie so then they just put I've never seen, um... - a deep-neck pants. (laughs) - [JACOB] So many layers. He does have a lot of layers, Jacob. - That's his whole thing. Layers were--if you weren't layered, - if you know what I'm saying. Oh, there you go. Can I take a moment? challenge the idea, 'cause he's like, Not really. You are mean and scary, and then you're nice sometimes. What is the additional He has layer. - Onion has layer. - I don't know. (laughing) All right. &quot;Despite Well, yeah. Like pirates? (laughs) - Oh, wait. &quot;Plundered.&quot; Can you scroll back to when they start doing one of whom was - [JORDAN] Yeah, a plunderer. So, now just go a frame or two forward. - Whoooa! The twins. - Um, also-- Yeah. Wow. OK. Maybe a circus? (laughing) &quot;A traveling circle.&quot; Oh, I guess he is pretty strong. Why not--I feel like you could be-- - Whoa, what the hell? - Yeah. &quot;I turned into a different guy.&quot; - &quot;I went less bald.&quot; I feel like, at a traveling circus... you know, you could be Uh, and so why wouldn't just be the attraction himself? - Why does he have to lift stuff? - (laughing) &quot;Look at me and my weird ears! The Incredible Meyer. - The Incredible Shrek! - He's--what is that? - (laughs) Like, huh? and I'm like, &quot;Watch, And he jumps through the hoop You're like, &quot;Wait, can that dog talk?&quot; &quot;No, check it out. Did you know--did we ever talk about this? You know how Air Bud just was - Yeah. He was owned by I tried to teach Dipper how to play - [JORDAN] That makes sense. &quot;I don't wanna pray!&quot; He's like, &quot;We should (laughs) &quot;Oh, Dipper, [STAZ] He doesn't wanna Right. That makes sense. You need to buy a team. He did show up with a clipboard - Dude, he's a nepo baby. He was mad at the other dogs (laughs) - &quot;You're forgetting our schemes!&quot; So, did he become green then? - Did you see what he said?! - &quot;The luxurious Titanic.&quot; - Shrek? - (laughing) I mean, the boiler room. Phil? or Phi-phi in the comments says, &quot;He was based on Maurice Tillet. This guy doesn't even exist.&quot; But how would they get that photo Rest in peace, by the way. Unless it was a different - Shoutout to the boiler room. testing out the boiler room - Making sure it boils? &quot;Yep!&quot; the to-scale remodel that, uh, - James Cameron made for the movie. There's a comment that says, what's real and what's not.&quot; I'm pretty... sure. - I'm not getting that close. - [STAZ] I know that this isn't real. You know that meme? of him walking out on stage on Coachella, and now people are swapping How long until we can completely replace Leonardo DiCaprio - [STAZ] The whole movie? I feel like that technology Replace him with just I don't know if it's five years, but there's gonna start being going, uh, &quot;Fuck it, Shrek Titanic,&quot; - and then it'll be like the full movie. And then it's a nightmare because they've now so you can't one-to-one compare. This is gonna be Um, and then people aren't They're gonna be like, [STAZ] There's gonna be &quot;Yeah, I've seen Shrek. &quot;Have you seen Oppenheimer, Yeah. &quot;I don't know if this is real.&quot; They replace, uh, Robert Downey, Jr.'s character It's The Wizard of Oz, They're like, &quot;It was AI,&quot; - [STAZ] &quot;That was The Wiz!&quot; [JACOB] People pirate the Patreon content, but you're Family Guy characters. OK, now that is worth it. They can - I'll sign up. We will filter our server income Sounds good. Sign me up. As long as I can be Peter. Um... Make me... the guy that plays... Cleveland. Mm. &quot;Oh, yeah.&quot; &quot;As a boiler room worker [JORDAN] &quot;Oh, no, it's ice.&quot; &quot;Cherish-ed.&quot; (gasps) What happened?! - No! Why does it look like he's scheming? - (laughs) He's holding a big iceberg. - What are you doing?! - and it's him. It's Shrek. [JACOB] He's the iceberg. He's on the phone with the iceberg. - (Jacob laughing) - &quot;The hell?&quot; And they made him littler. Yeah, we didn't answer so we get hit by an iceberg. [STAZ] Imagine the iceberg like, you know, someone trying to - get hit by a car or something. the likes of which have never been seen. Jumps out there with a knife. - Uh... Yeah. - OK, so I picked one. So, wait, he's dead. But he's voice--eh. Well, he recorded all of this... posthumously. Wait, whoa, no, he-- - Wait, go back. He actually survived. &quot;Rumors say I actually saved lives.&quot; What do you mean, &quot;rumors&quot;? &quot;By breaking a jam...&quot; Breaking a jam that was in the Well, yeah, before it fucking sank. Wait a second. What do you mean, &quot;rumors&quot;? - Did you start the rumor? I'm starting to think No, this is Michael Myers. Right. - [STAZ] I think it's Meyer Myshalls. Meyer Myshalls sounds like [STAZ] &quot;Meyer Myshalls.&quot; It doesn't feel like a thing All of these ones, like... All the designs and they just made them, like, Those look like Riverdale designs. - Yeah. - Yeah. OK, well-- Or that's like--the Scooby-Doo one, - sexy Dawn of the Dead. [STAZ] Did Ryan Murphy make this TikTok? Oh, he's piloting? Yeah. OK, so here's my thinking. I... I really need to see the Pokemon one. I am curious about SpongeBob SquarePants. I'm very curious about the Minions. Why did that one not go viral? I gotta say the SpongeBob SquarePants one is like visually grotesque. - OK, we won't do that. Here's something interesting. The Willy Wonka one has 4 million views. We know about Willy Wonka and AI. Um, and also, the same company that's put on that Willy Wonka thing - so we might try-- We might try, if we can get in. 'Cause there's one or two results. They've tried to get in on the meme or they are genuinely Like Sony when Morbius, they re-release it, like, I hope that they are just like, &quot;Oh. I guess people really liked the event.&quot; &quot;Even less lemonade.&quot; [STAZ] I hope it's sincere, - let's try and make a bad event.&quot; - [STAZ] I don't want that. It's, like, not quite there. - Oh, I watched The Neighbors. His TV series on Hulu back in... ten years ago now. - And boy, is it bad. At least it's long. Oh, God, it's torture. It's actually just mixed horribly, But, um... OK. So I'm starting to see a pattern where the ones that are popular are like a little bit believable, like - Willy Wonka's really based on a guy. Whereas the Minions, obviously, &quot;The Minions are based on, uh...&quot; &quot;I'm John C. Minion, and the Minions are actually based on me. I had the intellect of a genius - as a baby.&quot; - Yeah. The Joker one you'd expect but I think people - Yeah. The AI's gotta be the best for - fucking change him. Uh, let's do the Minions. One sec, before we click the Minions one. It is... - [JARVIS] Bad? preposterous one I saw, - like, as to what the origin is. Do you wanna guess? Should we do it last? - I mean, we can do it now, but... It's ridiculous. Which also - It's the least believable. Not &quot;do you think.&quot; You've seen it. where there was like a lab leak? And--or... Like an experiment gone wrong, It may lead there. I only saw but that was enough to go, - This is insane.&quot; (both laughing) - 1950s Kevin. from 1950 San Francisco.&quot; &quot;I am a child, and You know how they make - (Staz laughing) Which Kevin? Yeah, wait, sorry. (laughs) Jeffrey Epstein, the financier? (laughs) &quot;Ha!&quot; - Let's call Ghislaine. - &quot;1969 Kevin? The president?&quot; (laughs) Dude, that's Kevin. &quot;Oh, 1950s Kevin, from San Francisco.&quot; This one was assassinated [JARVIS] I see. (Jordan laughs) Why?! (laughing) Why was he--?! In all caps! - &quot;Gru, after the movie Despicable Me.&quot; Yeah, it's almost that scene in &quot;A young senator - named JOHN F. KENNEDY.&quot; Uh, &quot;voted to impeach.&quot; The best part of that movie I always imagine the room where and it's maybe like people and he keeps waiting I become--I become death, the destroyer...&quot; - &quot;I have become...&quot; - &quot;I'm become...&quot; &quot;And I have also created them.&quot; (Staz laughing) (Irish accent) &quot;Oh, I'm become death. &quot;I've... become Minion, (laughing) &quot;Destroyer of...&quot; &quot;A tall bald man [STAZ] This sounds like Well, this is Kevin, - [STAZ] I forgot. Kevin from the '50s. - so stupid ever again! He's a mutated child! Is that what they're called? Wait, pause. Pause! (wheezing) The house-- You know, it's just a Yeah. It was like, &quot;You know &quot;This house is clean. &quot;It was spick and span. Danger's afoot.&quot; Me when I just walk in-- and every time I walk into it I'm like, - &quot;What the hell? It's so clean.&quot; but then it's like, um... &quot;Then we were in the basement. And we found... - another basement.&quot; Like, wow! Spooky! Just a regular basement, full of dust. Oh. Wait, pause that. Like, &quot;I gotta get this map, in case Yeah. Also, these are kids? How are they uncovering a plot? Is it like, &quot;I'm Gru--&quot; He wrote his whole plan down? &quot;I'm Gru. This is a map of the world. Dude, it's like the letter - and leaves in the swamp. it's the letters all around Uh, &quot;Gortash's plan to attack the Sword Coast.&quot; &quot;Dude, don't forget &quot;It's your birthday. Year. And that, of course, is 199--&quot; Whoa. The HAZMAT children? Yeah, they don't really Oh, are they gonna become it?! Yeah, they're basically saying, &quot;He put on little HAZMAT suits, - and we became the little HAZMAT suits.&quot; &quot;And also, we were naked - so we put on suspenders.&quot; &quot;We were nude, which is weird.&quot; Ew. What the fuck? Except for--except for this one. Good job he made a TikTok. (laughs) [STAZ] The one telling the story Normal child from 1950 - Excuse me. &quot;The one&quot;? Kevin from 1950. - We all know the Kevin of each year. - The one from &quot;Gilmore Guys...&quot; (laughs) He's dressed real nice. Yeah. Yeah, I've never seen Though he needs to shave. - They're bald by choice, the Minions. I guess it's just style, or just does Stewie, or whatever Does #horrortok mean - It seems like it. It's the slowed and Niya says, &quot;Just spoiled - (laughs) I turned into Jerry Seinfeld for a second. - &quot;What's the show?! What got spoiled?!&quot; Maybe there's a Minion show?&quot; &quot;They're called the Minions. They lived during the dino--? - What is going on? Dumbass. Sorry. But... If anything gets me steamed, it's comments and people &quot;We began to transform into Gru's--&quot; I hate that there's a new line So... So, it's weird, 'cause what did he...? I wanna know how he uh, uh, Kevin, and then--it was Kevin? - [JORDAN] Kevin. 1950 Kevin. And then also, why is he still young? Like, what is this...? It's like a confessional where it's like you're seeing even though you know &quot;When Chiara said that to me, - Or like, &quot;I'm about to go off!&quot; Here's me going off.&quot; &quot;In the same outfit I wore two weeks ago.&quot; You're wearing the [STAZ] Maybe he's psychic. [STAZ] Also, I've never seen - including Despicable Me. [STAZ] So I'm assuming - Yeah. - bar for bar. - maybe, though. &quot;Tall bald man named Gru.&quot; That doesn't even look-- - Nicknamed Gru. Why couldn't they do where they give him the big Gru body? - Yeah, just do Peter again. [STAZ] You know, Gru has quite a nose. - Right! True. Yeah, they go sideways And he does his voice. He goes, &quot;I'm Steve Carell &quot;Hi! Would you like a Dundie?&quot; - (Jarvis chuckling) &quot;Dude, my childhood ruined!&quot; (laughing) These comments rule. What's the Pokemon one? I think these people are happy. The people - Oh, for sure. &quot;Eclipse is gonna explode, - and I'll travel to a dimension--&quot; Mike Myers is called Myers Michael. After that, I'm like, the - gotta be funny. - 'cause it's--the imagery. a lady named Dora. Oh, I remember this one! Hello. - (laughing) He was in a coma. It's so funny that-- First of all, Spearow, Sparrow, name of an animal. - Um... And this is the one time They just had to put in a They kept typing in &quot;Spearow,&quot; [STAZ] The AI's like, &quot;I don't &quot;Dude, I put him in a coma.&quot; The, um... this is also like a old theory. - [JORDAN] Yeah. - because it's a cartoon show for kids. You could say it about any show Oh, they were in a coma, - It's all a dream, actually. Um... The, uh--can we go back to just-- I love AI fingers. - Oh, yeah. Look at that. What is going on there? And he talked about himself Are they about to say--'cause he implying, &quot;Pokemon isn't real.&quot; Sure. Wrong, but sure. Then... is he about to say and it was by, like, I'm gonna guess that's where it's going. Oh, OK. Yup, there it is. Is it a dream, or not?! Why are they resuscitating, like... - like, a Koopa? Wait, go back. - Who are they resuscitating? It's, like, taken some of the... Like, why is his back like a--what is that? - Never been in a coma? [JACOB] Also, you don't They should try that. (laughs) You also don't resuscitate someone Am I...? Is that his back? - Am I even interpreting that correctly? - That's what it looks like! Clearly, that part at the bottom is materially supposed to be And then that circle in the center and red is his actual baseball cap, - like, pattern. &quot;To be honest, these stories are interesting to watch.&quot; And then someone else says, I've heard it before. But there's also the theory - Interesting stuff.&quot; No it's not. How did Bart get his? How did Stewie get his immortality? Well, Stew James actually got it - from being the highest IQ ever recorded. And teaching his dog to talk. That's awesome. - Again... - Damn. Dude. - Same. Forever getting, uh... uh, strays, I guess, or direct shots. My subconscious is Misty, for what? They also just couldn't... They couldn't do Brock as an AI guy? - They had to just use...? Yeah, when they choose to use the thing. So funny. - Ugh! You can do this about literally any story. Take all of the characters and say, this is a manifestation of that. Especially if it has themes. - And someone wrote it. it would literally be like - &quot;Huh, interesting theory.&quot; I would get an F Stewie's a manifestation - Right. Brian is-- Brian is a manifestation of my (laughs) I'm a very... How? Oh, right, they had to make it [STAZ] He's dead, so how is he talking? Well, how did they write--who-- Who was looking at this? Who was getting this information - Was he writing unconsciously? [STAZ] Wait, maybe he's not dead; he came out of the coma, and that's He started speaking nonsense, and - [JORDAN] &quot;Put him back in.&quot; electrocuted by sparrows, or some shit?&quot; This really makes me--like... Sarah Natochenny's a bad person for this. - Yeah, she kinda did that. - (laughs) &quot;Help me! I'm in a coma!&quot; That was weird. - &quot;'Ey, I'm fuckin' dead!&quot; - &quot;Finook!&quot; &quot;Start resuscitatin' my turtle shell!&quot; (laughing) &quot;Oh, it cracked. Shit.&quot; &quot;I became a Pokemon master in my dreams.&quot; After--I love the phrasing they had. It was like, &quot;Every shock was the EMT trying to and then when they gave up - they put me on life support.&quot; you age in a coma. - No. But the whole--oh, I see. I'm still looking at him That's his ghost. It's like the idea of somebody &quot;Well, you know, then They're like, &quot;He doesn't (laughs) &quot;You can't do that.&quot; &quot;Ah, fuck!&quot; Japan did it, so. I love trying to justify things His name is Ash Ketchum, by the way. - Ash Ketchum is actually Ash Ketchum. Yeah. They really went for it. These are cool. (laughs) - I actively like these. They've been cranking these things out. Oh, Avatar: The Last Airbender. - No way. Wait, SpongeBob SquarePants, but then OH, wait, no, 'cause - There's two Avatar ones. - Well, they perfected the arrow AI. - Gave it another swing. That Avatar got way more Wait, there's three SpongeBob SquarePants. And those two are just guys. The Harry Potter is just-- (high-pitched cackling) &quot;Shrek origins, part 2&quot;? And now he looks like Jabba the Hutt? Yeah, it's really orig-- (laughing) I thought &quot;I escaped on a boiler room door.&quot; Rumors are. [STAZ] Did you watch the Willy Wonka one?
