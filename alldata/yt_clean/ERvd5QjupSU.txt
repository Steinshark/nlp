# Oh, how do you know the highest... # Fascinating Rhythm # Fascinating Rhythm Once upon a time, a teenager in the suburbs of North London uploaded some videos to YouTube and they became a global sensation. JACOB HARMONISES # One, two, three # Come with me and you'll be # In a world of pure imagination... I'm here in North London, of Jacob Collier. # Worshipped the beloved # With a kiss. # Jacob's extraordinary a cappella and caught the attention Quincy Jones and Herbie Hancock. I promise you, you've never or heard this before. Unbelievable. Unbelievable! # Don't you worry 'bout a thing... # Don't you worry 'bout a thing, # Baby... I thought I was good with harmonies. No, he was all over my stuff Hey! Jacob's YouTube uploads turned out of a musical career # Moon river # Wider than a mile. # Next guest is nominated including Album of the Year. # You're all I need... Jacob's multi-instrumental skills # Underneath the moonlight, oh. # # Cos I've been sleeping # So I imagined # Something like you could # And all I had to do was be tame. # And he collaborates with music He's like nothing I've ever worked with before, # Night and day, light and dark... # Any day it could be We all recognised, &quot;Oh, this guy # My love is my protection... Jacob now tours the world. # I'll be a world of your And his music from pop to jazz to classical. INSTRUMENTAL The reason he doesn't sound when he plays is because doesn't have any boundaries. He can't help but explore. # Cos I've been sleeping Jacob made music history ever to win Grammys for each Not even The Beatles did that. # I've been sleeping on my dreams. # Jacob doesn't have When he's not touring the globe, he lives a very I think I'm getting warm. He's still producing music out of a small room in the family Come on in. So... ..this is the legendary It's my favourite room This is the room... We're in the room where it happens. JACOB VOCALISES # I love the way that I feel When did you first come I learned to walk in here, aged one. # Cos every time I think about it # I can't stop thinking about it. # I see this array of guitars. All sorts of guitars. Different stages of my life. This one, this is my first A nylon string... JACOB STRUMS How old were you there? I think 14 or so. And my first-ever bass guitar which I think was about the same So age 14 or so. And it seemed To me, I think, whenever I play I'm just trying to be a voice. Whether it's a piano or drums it's all really the same language. Like this typewriter here. So that's nice. And until now, as far as I can see, on YouTube, all those they were all made in this room? I did it all on one mic And I wanted to show you that mic, because it's such a cool beastie. OK, check this out. This is... THEY LAUGH ..my original SM58 Shure microphone. Yeah. Hey, that's an antique. It's an antique. And I don't mean but...it smells really good. Go on, have a go. This is the kind of mother ship. Yeah. It was here where Jacob's with harmonisation, and the power of social media to change his life forever. # Everybody's got a thing. # It was Jacob's arrangement of a Stevie Wonder classic, Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing, that went viral. # Reachin' out in vain # Just taking the things # Don't you worry 'bout a thing... JACOB HARMONISES # Don't you worry 'bout a thing, I took that song and I went like, harmonically - because of this fabric. I knew chords and I knew the piano. I wanted to go further. # Don't you worry 'bout a thing... # Don't you worry 'bout a thing, I was doing all this stuff. I didn't understand but I was doing microtones - notes between notes on the piano - and some of these notes, like this You can't play it on a piano. You have to do that by ear because It goes... JACOB VOCALISES Like this. It goes between The things which always surprise me is his inherent knowledge of how to get in between the cracks of the Western scale, you know? Those quarter turn things he does, which are way beyond me. And here I actually managed JACOB VOCALISES But when you hear it, That's the great thing, And that's almost what When they start, they're trying but actually what they want Whether you like it or you don't You recognise, &quot;Oh, that's them. &quot;That's their voice.&quot; If you isolate the parts... LOW PITCH: # Standing on the side ..they sound really strange. HIGH-PITCH: # Cos I'll be standing OFF-PITCH: # Cos I'll be standing So you're... In the end, HARMONISED: # Cos I'll be standing JACOB HARMONISES These chords are incredibly dense, # Ba-ba-ba-ba, when you get off... # ..your trip. # Really dense, jazz-inspired, classical-inspired chords, and all I'm thinking about is the way in which the notes move between each other as melodies, and then does it feel good? So much of what he does # Don't you worry 'bout... Jacob's homage to the Stevie Wonder also contains a multi-instrumental The guitar, mandolin, double bass, djembe drums and other are all being played by Jacob. # Don't you worry # Don't you worry 'bout a thing # Don't you worry # Don't you worry 'bout a thing. # Anyway, it got to the point and I put &quot;Don't Worry 'Bout a Thing &quot;arranged and performed in this typeface font. And there's always a moment when you think, &quot;I'm not quite sure.&quot; Cos it's very personal, all this The process of layering these tracks takes time, and obviously you're But I remember there was a part &quot;Jacob, are you sure that Jacob at that time said, &quot;I'm not sure I'm ready &quot;and give it away into the world.&quot; And I said, &quot;I think you'll make people's lives &quot;But I have a feeling, Jacob, &quot;that nothing will ever be You take that leap and you don't after you take that leap. This is a screenshot of the moment Here it says &quot;no views&quot;. JACOB LAUGHS From this exact second onwards, and it climbed faster than I'd ever And within a couple of days, I think it was about 100,000. So I put it on Bandcamp, you know, it's like PS1, And I'm looking at my &quot;Someone's having a laugh!&quot; This blew my mind. And this is an email I received &quot;Ba-da-boom,&quot; it says, &quot;Greetings, Jacob Collier. &quot;Herbie Hancock has just bought &quot;Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing, &quot;Oh, What a Beautiful Morning...&quot; And then I received this little Says, &quot;Wow, Jacob, &quot;Please keep expanding in your life &quot;I believe that craft may be &quot;of the notes, but music is Herbie Hancock. I will never forget the first time on Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing. It blew my mind. And he was a teenager, so I wrote you know, telling him how much There had been a decade before that in Herbie Hancock - harmonically I was just obsessed with him. And so here he is in my Gmail inbox The day that Jacob Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing, We got messages on Quincy's Facebook. Some of my artists had forwarded it to me. I was like, &quot;OK, I gotta &quot;show this to Quincy.&quot; Quincy Jones is one of the world's Over six decades, he's worked with Aretha Franklin, and Miles Davis, to name just a few. And I showed it to Quincy, and Quincy just lost his mind. He said, &quot;I don't care &quot;I don't care how busy you are, &quot;find this kid.&quot; So I get this email from actually saying, &quot;Quincy's just seen &quot;and just freaked out &quot;Are you down?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah. Yeah, I'm down. &quot;Of course. When?&quot; By this point, I was 19, and I You can see the morning sunshine Yeah. This is the moment. You captured it! I thought, &quot;You know what, I might Well, what else would you do Not call him? 12 notes all over the world and you have to make it through You have to make it work. Jacob knows how to make it work. The first thing he said was, Whatever he does blows my mind. Unbelievable. Unbelievable! But he's that way with anything and that's what... ..hypnotised me And action. JACOB BEATBOXES Today, Jacob's musical identity and multi-instrumentalist talents are complemented by his collection Yeah, I'm trying to work out Number two, I think. Thanks. THEY LAUGH So I want to start at the beginning. What is your first musical memory? What do you retain now? First musical memory, was sitting in that room over there, which was the music room sitting on my mum's lap and watching her play the violin And that was my first experience and one of my first memories My dad said to me, the moment Jacob popped out, he said, &quot;You've just got to keep &quot;Play him the lullaby. I picked up the violin I'd say probably 18 months and by age four or five, Did it disappoint you that Jacob Oh, that's really interesting. I was impatient for results. I wanted to hear a sound So a drum or a piano but a violin, it takes a year or so, to even make one note sound good Was I disappointed? No, absolutely not! I mean, the child showed me of the sound world. You don't need to have the violin. Suzie Collier is a classical conductor and professor of music. But you're going to really sock Jacob's mother, Suzie, she is I mean, a really amazing teacher I learn things when, again, through I watch her. And I learn things, and you think, &quot;I wish somebody had said that. &quot;I'm really pleased CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS There's a story, isn't there, There is a story about our Hoover. It's really true. One day, the Hoover's on and I simply say... ..&quot;What do you think that note is?&quot; Your mother came in with a Hoover what note it was? What...? How did you respond? Um, it was a funny thing. Because, obviously, there's sounds all around you. And many of those sounds The kettle goes boing or the microwave beeps And so what she began was a sense of curiosity about &quot;Sing that note, &quot;see if you can kind of &quot;and just get the same frequency.&quot; HOOVERS HARMONISE I have a sense that music somehow Where does it come from? I had musical parents. They were both violinists. And this was my father's violin, which he bestowed upon me And he said to me, &quot;I think &quot;I think it will really &quot;and it'll bring out Your mother. Yes. Your brother. Indeed. There's you. And that's your father That's my father. My mother was Chinese Canadian. She ended up coming over and went My dad was the youngest student and in the end they met. I moved into this house in 1989. From that moment, we've made music in this house. OK. MUSIC STARTS I would just go over there and press and just wonder what would come out, Mozart. Herbie Hancock. Bach. Benjamin Britten, obviously. # Peter Grimes! # Britten was earth-shattering to me the whole of what it meant a musician, a composer, a harmonist. # Grimes! # It could be anything by Sting. # Every breath you take # And every move you make... # It was huge for me, Sting - to stand there with that bass And he was the first person I ever &quot;Oh, so you can do both?&quot; On heavy rotation were people like HE VOCALISES He was the absolute master - at using his voice It could be anything # Let this groove From a very early age, complex harmonisations especially the gospel-inspired # But I've got something that # It's called love... Take 6 is one of my absolute They're doing this insane modulation # Oh, but I wish we had much more # More love is what we need. # At around six years old, Jacob was and a queue-based software program. The means for starting a music room Let me take you right back. OK. This is 2006, so I was 11 and then turning 12. And I was obsessed with maths, And so my solution to this problem with my little 12-year-old voice. No-one's ever heard these before. This is the first time I've ever Oh, let's do... Let's do three. # Three times table # Three times table... You've doubled your voice up? # Three times table... And I'm playing bass. Here we go now! # Once times three is three, yeah # Two times three is six... # # Nine times table # Nine times table RECORDING: # Nine times table... # While he was working they would be completely and we would know those tables Stuff that he's been into and stuff has been a huge part of the kind Here we go! # Once times seven is seven... # Two times seven is 14 # Three times seven is 21... # My whole family Just so sick of this recording. I don't really remember I think you kind of just SOPHIE LAUGHS INSTRUMENTAL What's it called, Ella? No idea. A lot of people a massive musical rivalry but I think it would have been hard to be a professional musician, but my day job is to be Music is just so intrinsic It's not really I think there's been much more of making music, often together. JACOB VOCALISES When Jacob was ten, and his mother, Suzie, APPLAUSE You have been a single mum so it's quite an achievement for you to harmonise your family, to create this sort of sense Are there tough times Are there times when people feel - you can't cope with it? If I just sit in that and just think with these children, then it becomes Do we experience Absolutely. Absolutely! But positive energy, I think, pervading the very, In terms of the life bumps that he that's also a blessing because I think that's where The thing that's like, &quot;Right, I'm APPLAUSE You like to perform. That engagement So this is obviously something Did you ever want to be an actor? I had a moment where acting surfaced # Oh, what a day # If it's Christmas together... # Nine-year-old Jacob played Tiny Tim in a film version of A Christmas I started singing lessons and they went till I was about I think the work on the was really important, and we both out in Budapest. Tiny Tim! If I may, young sir? Here's his coat, mother. Thank you, Mr Scrooge! Why, you're as light as a feather! I believe we shall become fast I could tell that he was taking in I never really partly because It's one of the reasons why, the music industry because so many people and exaggerating themselves the And I think my approach is always just The first instrument I truly This guy - Yeah, it's quite a beauty. It wasn't till I was about 14 which is my next instrument. And there's something about standing These two beasties The way this instrument works or you can put it And the first tune this James Taylor song And this was sort of because I thought, &quot;it will unlock lots of other songs And I haven't played it in ages... ..but it goes something like this. MUSIC: Carolina In My Mind I had been really obviously obsessed And I think lots of young musicians where they think, &quot;Well, I don't &quot;but I want to get to When I was about 14 years old, a family friend called Gwilym Simcock. And I managed to go to a gig and it was a huge moment for me that I didn't know anything ..but that there was so much And at the end of the gig, I went up and I said, you know, &quot;and I would just love I think he must have been There's a long way for and I've taught many people And, of course, at that stage, you're, a lot of the time, dealing And he said, So, I played him something. Probably a simple jazz standard And I basically used I didn't use these ones. So, I would play these really, Because that's what I knew It seems like but I do remember to the things I was suggesting and just his general approach He told me something that kind of which was, &quot;I think That's what he said. He said, &quot;When you have technique, &quot;then your technique And I always thought that If you heard it, you could play it, What I didn't realise is that's greater than your ears, all the technique and grow, as well. It's impossible to take much credit You know, everything is basically so the fact that has had a nice impact on him At around 2011, that's when I made which was called Serendipity. This was the first moment that I could look at So, you're actually absorbing different things, understand where you're going As you say, you then... And I didn't know where I was going, but I just tried so from times tables to eventually harmonising jazz tunes. I wasn't thinking too much I was just doing things I kept uploading these videos, and each time I'd upload one, it would be another little bump I found Jacob listening to a playlist and I woke up by someone called Jacob Collier, and I thought he must be from And he immediately and I'd only heard one piece Entered the rabbit hole on YouTube like, him performing, Him doing the covers. It's like a magician at work, like. Because Jacob's come up where you have direct communication there's no middleman at all - it's all perfectly suited to him, He really was born And then came this arrangement of a Stevie Wonder song called HARMONISES: # Don't you worry Quincy was so in love with and later, that Jacob did, as well, that he would start by showing those two videos It didn't matter if that was he would show that video and say, &quot;I've never seen anything So, we invited him to come meet us at the Montreux Jazz Festival So, I thought, &quot;OK, I'll go, then.&quot; I met him at the airport. We entered this hotel lobby And the two of us surprised Quincy, and was like, &quot;Jacob Collier!&quot; And he was like, &quot;Show me some of And he's saying, &quot;Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing?&quot; And I'm saying, And then, &quot;Oh, actually, &quot;cos it has a microtone in it. &quot;You can't play it on the piano. And he's like, &quot;Wow, that's cool. Because he's going to take us I'd like you to get ready And Quincy gets the mic and says, &quot;Right, I want to introduce you So, I stand up Unscheduled late-night jams That's Herbie Hancock sitting there, and I'm thinking... What a day! ..&quot;What a day!&quot; You know, When I got a chance to hear him that's when I got a chance to really hear his jazz chops. That's what we call that, right? And he's got the jazz chops, And something happened. # Your looks are laughable... # Something kind of clicked. # Unphotographable... # And I just sort of felt like, &quot;OK, &quot;I don't know &quot;but I think I'm in the right place When you meet an artist your priority is to get to know them And then, that night, after hanging out and jamming in the jam I go up to Quincy's hotel room, and I sat on this balcony with Adam, and Adam said... You know, &quot;What are you after &quot;What do you want to do I said, &quot;I don't know, man. &quot;I don't want to be jazz Jacob &quot;I don't want to be pop Jacob &quot;I don't want to be &quot;I think I need some time &quot;I'm not sure.&quot; Jacob has always kind of known what he wants to say yes to and why. And he said, &quot;Do you think I said, &quot;I really don't know. And when that call was made, Adam said, &quot;Well, Quincy would I said, &quot;Would it be possible And it's gone down in history because obviously no-one's I wouldn't characterise it you know, working with us down. I think it was just What I made clear was, &quot;Look, &quot;but I need to do this on my own.&quot; It was on that call to start off just being friends. We started helping And a couple of months later, Adam had somehow found a way my first-ever gig - which was opening for Herbie Hancock at the Montreux Jazz Festival, And, suddenly, I had a direction. That's the moment from a man named Ben Bloomberg. I saw this video. It was And I sent a Facebook message, saying, &quot;Hey, &quot;I love to build things. &quot;If you ever are interested &quot;or have any questions As a music and technology innovator, Ben Bloomberg worked on Opera Of The Future. He also collaborated with pop stars The original message that ended up in Jacob's spam and maybe a couple of weeks later, Jacob happened upon it I looked at the message and said, &quot;We need to reach out to him.&quot; And then, all of a sudden, They had been offered and it was going to be I got on Skype with Ben and I explained this idea I have where I could be at the centre and I could be somehow basically doing what I do at home but doing it in real time. And also, at the centre of I wanted to have this instrument where I could sing any note and you'd hear my voice I wanted a way to stand on stage and you'd hear 12 voices come out, The harmoniser was one of the Jacob would fly to Boston, they would create the prototype which would accompany Jacob Montreux Jazz Festival performance. Jacob! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE 20 years old. I promise you, you've never seen Never! HE CHUCKLES Merci. And it was like It was like, &quot;Well, here we go.&quot; Like, &quot;This is the start HE HARMONISES I'm sort of standing there HE HARMONISES ..playing... I'm nailing all my musical parts. But just furtive-looking. HE HARMONISES I was basically inside my room. I hadn't left the room yet, And so... And you were in front of And, you know, they didn't know... &quot;Who's this boy in his pyjamas # Don't you worry 'bout a... # And it was the start of learning # Cos I'll be standing on... # Jacob also integrated a specially designed for his live performances. HE HARMONISES At the time that he performed, I wanted to hear his music. HE LAUGHS It was amazing. and he plays all these instruments - ..and bass and guitar The Montreux gig would ignite Thank you, Montreux. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Following this gig in Montreux, of confidence. &quot;Oh, I think &quot;I think I'm ready I had this idea on a flight that there was this amazing And I always loved that song and I always felt because it's about this world that's a safe kind of world, and you can go and you can, you know, It's just a gorgeous tune. # In my room... # And I thought, &quot;Well, why don't &quot;and I'll do the song on the album?&quot; I want to make this album. For better or worse, with my own ideas And I felt like, really, I wanted the album to represent I came up with this idea that I thought would be pretty fun. I thought, &quot;Why don't I get people - &quot;fans - in the world &quot;to send me little melody clips, &quot;15 seconds in length, &quot;of them singing, you know, a song &quot;or improvising or whatever?&quot; I think it was $100 and in return, and put it on my social media. It was a brain wave. It was one of those ideas ..he just ran with. # Someday, when I'm awfully low # And the world is cold # I will feel a glow HE HARMONISES # Someday, when I'm awfully low # And the world is cold # I will feel a glow I think I loved the ones that but they did something # You got to keep it mellow # Ooh-ooh-ooh. # And Jacob sort of magnified that into something that is just They're so giving. # You got to keep it mellow # Ooh-ooh-ooh In some ways, that's when you know, when he takes something and he's able to transform it which can then bring a lot of joy not only to the original creator, but I think to everyone It was so cool because It was like, &quot;Oh, today, &quot;who is singing in a language # Vengo del otro lado &quot;..a song I don't know.&quot; # Del otro lado del rio # Vengo del otro lado del charco # Vengo del otro lado del rio BOTH: # Vengo del otro lado Some of them are really challenging. Like, you know, Soley May was her name. When you say a baby, She was probably one or two. # Twinkle, twinkle, little star... # In my mind, really interesting was going on It was just free - # How I wonder what you are. # HE HARMONISES # How I wonder what you are BOTH: # Up above the world # Chocolate biscuit! # It was able to transcend So, never mind who you are in a world, whether you can just about whether you're five years old and so many people's stories # La-la-la-la-la-la-la, JACOB HARMONISES # La-la-la-la-la-la-la # La-la-la, la-la-ah! # All right, here we go. Selfie mode. HE CLEARS HIS THROAT All yours. Take it away. # Swing low, sweet chariot # Coming for to carry me home # Swing low, sweet chariot # Coming for to carry me home. # APPLAUSE Wow. Come on. Bring it through. Outstanding work. Am I in the wrong profession? LAUGHTER # Swing low # Sweet chariot BOTH: # Coming for to carry me home # Swing low # Sweet chariot # Coming for to carry me # Home The #IHarmU enterprise top up the budget You know, I realise how much work I kind of thought about the to do. I wanted to which I hadn't I wanted to do a couple of cos that was where I come from. I wanted it to be harmonically weird I mean, really, There's a lot of mixing. There's a lot of... The final mix of Jacob's new album We were trying to find that could interface to produce and record It just so happened to be that Hans Zimmer's studio I went to Hans Zimmer's studio and I went there with Ben. Hans Zimmer is one of Hollywood's He worked on six including Inception and the Batman trilogy. You know, we did three movies - and people think, It's not three movies. What I didn't know was that Quincy Jones had booked for Jacob to work at. And I remember, one day, going into the kitchen and there was a guy and going off into the other studio. I'm going, &quot;It's really weird, &quot;and he looks just like And somebody said, Now we know how to... We took the tracks out of Logic, and we mixed the album which was really cool. MUSIC PLAYS Shall we take out some...? Inevitably, what happened turned my studio into his bedroom. And the front door opens Herbie Hancock's coming in, I mean, it's like all my heroes, they're all coming through They're coming to see Jacob. Hey! Nice to see you. This stuff is good. Quincy and Herbie You know, we'd be working on a song, and Herbie and Quincy and they'd stay till the early hours bopping their heads and there'd be a moment in a tune... There's a chord HE SINGS UNRULY CHORD, THEY EXCLAIM Jacob always surprises me, always comes up with things It got to that point &quot;Wait, stop, stop, stop, And we stop, and he's like, And I was like, &quot;Oh, it's this,&quot; D, F sharp, A, C sharp. Oh, OK. So, he hears that chord and He just goes, MUSIC PLAYS What?! What was that? HE LAUGHS He's never come up with Maybe just questioning what he had By the time he added or the instrumental background, We just have such a nice cos we both just geek out D major seventh. Cos you get the dominant at the top, Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It was one of the most magical He was leaving to go back to London. He's on his way to the airport I think he phoned me for letting me use the studio. And right at the end, before he has to get out of the cab, &quot;Are you ever interested And he goes, &quot;Yeah, of course.&quot; SHE SCREAMS, LAUGHS # You can sing what you want... # Jacob finish mastering and landed a Hollywood gig on a new animated feature, Oh! Marcos, wait! Where are you? I think working on music for film In July of 2016, Jacob's first album, # Take me # Anywhere you want to go... # It contained eight original songs # In my hideaway... # Every instrument on the album, every arrangement, I put together. # There's a song of love One of the arrangements was for the ..The Flintstones. # Flintstones # They're a modern HE HARMONISES My album came out and I thought, &quot;This is what people do, isn't it? &quot;They have albums that come out HE SINGS With the help of Ben Bloomberg, the Jacob Collier dream would become a reality. # Secrets to... # It started out with a US tour a show every single day It was just me and Ben on the road. So, Ben was the entirety of the crew # In my room... # It was completely overwhelming. Eight checked bags # Lock out all my... # And we thought we could We're going to... We were so tired and ill You know, we were just wrecked. So amazing to share these songs that CHEERING AND APPLAUSE The world tour would keep Jacob Thank you so much. One morning, He wakes me up in the morning &quot;What is it?&quot; And he says, &quot;Dude, &quot;you just got nominated And I said, &quot;Really?&quot; When, you know, it was announced that he was nominated I remember screaming at the top of my lungs. You know, the whole team was And I said, you know, &quot;Is that...? &quot;Was it a dream?&quot; And he said, &quot;No, The two Grammy nominations were for the arrangements and The Flintstones. And the Grammy goes to... ..Jacob Collier for You And I. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE In his category, Jacob was the Thank you to Mr Quincy Jones, amongst others, who are here Suddenly, it feels very serious, It doesn't feel like It feels like, And the night wasn't over. And the Grammy Award goes to... ..once more... ..Jacob Collier for Flintstones, CHEERING AND APPLAUSE People are watching, you know. People who aren't your fans I think it was the first time People who aren't Jacob fans are paying attention APPLAUSE Shall we do some drums? Yes. OK. I never identified with in the same way I did with genre, I used to sit in this room &quot;I don't need anybody. But when you really sit nothing is ever truly isolated, Jacob's next album of collaborating with, a 50-piece orchestra One, two, three, and... ORCHESTRA PLAYS I wanted to do something ..because I've done so much I wanted to stretch out It was the Quincy Jones team to the Metropole Orchestra Jules Buckley said an orchestral, And your mother was performing. We all went to Holland, That was my first time I did the orchestration This is... This was You know, I'd never written but to have a piece that was being played I wanted to make it really special. ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYS HE HUMS ALONG Jacob's ambitions would expand The first would be orchestral, the third would be primarily pop, and a fourth album is intended to be So, the world is alive. In the three volumes released so far he collaborates with more than from around the world. # Lambo or the double R-Truck On album three, released in 2020, Jacob works with and producer, Ty Dolla $ign, and UK R&amp;B singer Mahalia. # Now that I am sober # I take back what I said... # Jacob asked me if I wanted for his next album. When he called me and asked me, Do you know what? I think has just been a lot of surprises. The song is called All I Need. Here now, with help from Mahalia Jacob Collier, I remember Jacob texting me, &quot;I think I'm going and I said, &quot;Who's Ty?&quot; I didn't know her. I'd heard of her. I like her voice, for sure. # She got expensive taste, hey... # I've collaborated with Nicki Minaj, Ariana Grande, Mariah Carey. I had so much fun making that song. # That you are all I need # You are all I need It was lockdown. It just kind of gave me # You are all I need... # Jacob did his part. I did exactly what I wanted to do. # Cos I love your smile Now, Jacob's set-up and his bathroom was gorgeous, I felt a little bit like I was on... Like I had drawn the short straw. # Cos every time I think about it # Can't stop thinking... # I think I had my mop brush. # You are all I need... # Next thing you know, he sent me That was incredible. # Let your love shine # Hey-ey-ey... # The video where and there's that cloud of smoke - I think that was just VFX, HE CHUCKLES # Yeah... # # You will always be And he made a couple of changes Next thing you know, I think # Let your love shine bright... # All I Need was nominated and the album it was on was up Djesse Vol 3 was actually nominated That's the biggest honour Musicians really respect no matter, you know, # Only me... # # Well, my friends, Jacob would also collaborate with his all-time favourite To me, this was my childhood dream. That just blow... My mind was blown. They covered the Lionel Richie track Quincy... Yes. ..holding the chord symbols. ALL: # Party, Karamu # Fiesta, forever... # Take 6 have been touring the world ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, CHEERING AND APPLAUSE # No, no, no ..and they would perform with Jacob We were flying home We were all preparing Normally, no matter what it is, the guys will kind of listen and just kind of have When we were preparing for Jacob's, everybody was sitting on the flight LAUGHTER ..listening to their individual part for hours and hours of their flight. He's absolutely brilliant. THEY HARMONISE Hold it right there. And we actually had when we went to Quincy's house and there were 40 or 50 voices for the six of us # You and I # You and I # You and I... # THEY HARMONISE And then, in the thick of Jacob received of his own Night at the Proms. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE CHEERING I had a concert at the BBC Proms my own BBC Prom - which was just It was also for the entire Collier family. I love the Proms. To see Jacob having a Prom It was unbelievable, really. HE HARMONISES I remember I was quite nervous When he came on stage, I could just see I grew up in the Albert Hall. Suddenly, it went from just Jacob... ..to this huge array of people, all these different musicians, colliding in real time and it was extremely exciting. I remember the first conversations He wanted all his idols to be there. He didn't want this Off the record, it was cos he had so many different artists The evening featured His mum was also in the spotlight. I remember just thinking, just thinking, &quot;I'm so lucky to be here... &quot;..to be part of the orchestra, &quot;to see my boy in action Jacob also contributed which accompanied Mr Hamid El Kasri. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE HE SINGS An extraordinary Moroccan master he actually came to the BBC Prom and performed Please welcome to the stage Take 6. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE When Take 6 began, we performed at Royal Albert Hall and we now, going back years later, we realise how big it was It was an amazing experience. # I really found # Someone like you... # When we were sitting in the audience while we were all preparing and watching him perform and just the Metropole, it was... It was a wall of sound, but it was a blank canvas that allowed Jacob to do and to be everything that he was. # That you will be by my side Everything that he was doing, it was almost like He's just a kid having fun. # My life is through... # Somebody said, &quot;Jacob, we've got And they put up playing at NARRATOR: And there he is now, making his first appearance Somebody managed to unearth footage who was the leader, I think, at and he performed there It's just Jacob was really bowled over. He stood on that stage in 1964, and to be there, with my own Prom, I wish he could have been In some ways, he was there. After the Prom, we both burst because we both acknowledged He said, &quot;I just felt APPLAUSE The audience applauds CHEERING AND APPLAUSE It was the most wonderful and I will never, ever forget it. What I see in Jacob and the pleasure he gets from exploring this world And from family. Yes. From being... This gives him this anchor - the music room and you He derives a lot from his family but I can tell you that He will move out, but at the moment, because and so much of the year, just to come back to London And, boy, we really # Come alive, come alive I made this last night. This year, I found, it's never felt... It's never felt as pressurised Rather than thinking, &quot;the next thing I'm interested in,&quot; low-hanging fruit Like, &quot;Just do this, this, And you can just take off. The pressure from our end to continue to follow Now, finally, don't you think? These are they. These are some Grammys, and they GRAMMYS CHIME METALLICALLY Isn't that lovely? The only thing I've ever is to sustain the curiosity that I've always had There's a whole bunch of inspiration ..he doesn't even know about yet. He can do anything, And I feel like is the thing that really resonates # You've got a friend... # Jacob... THEY CHUCKLE ..I want to ask you about the future. Hmm. What about the long-term future? Creatively, but I do think that sometimes, is intimidating. I call it He should have no bounds, as in, he should forever be defiant, he should always just be a maverick. You know, honestly, I feel like the music will always give me And, sometimes, when I feel or a bit confused or a bit aimless, which I do all the time, sometimes, the music just says, &quot;We're going to go here now.&quot; # Cos I'll be standing on the side And did you hear from JACOB CHUCKLES I managed to meet him. I shook his hand. He was like, And I said, &quot;Oh, my name's Jacob - And he said, &quot;Oh, yeah, &quot;Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing, I said, &quot;Yeah, I did, Stevie. And he said, &quot;Oh, it's great. And my life was made at that moment. That meeting, I'll never forget it I think this room And even when I'm not in here, I think the spirit of it is something that I love whether it's on stage or just travelling I feel so much gratitude my family and my friends And I'm sure I'll travel all over and I'll be touring and recording but it's always a privilege to my original family home and to kind of lay down my materials and then think, &quot;Well, now what?&quot; They're calling me now. Just as we were calling it a wrap, Jacob received a phone call He had been nominated Yo! ON PHONE: You just got nominated Oh, what?! R&amp;B Song. You just got nominated. So, what's the Grammy for? Well, it's coming in now, but Oh, wait, I want to watch this! We're filming a documentary It's on a YouTube stream. Oh, wow!
