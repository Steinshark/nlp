What's in here good sir? Whatever you're doing with Clearly it's valuable. All right man. Nice chest. All right. Tate and Liza, two versus one. Doesn't seem fair. But team Sky is strong enough And it's all over. Team Sky takes down the celestial rocks. You should know, team Sky, Cause we know space. Do we know space? Is space included in the sky? I probably should have written down a more precise mission statement. What does this? Team Magma? What are you doing? As promised we've come What's the point of stealing rocket fuel? Since you're so curious we're going to jettison the Wow. Really get desperate when your plans to control the legendary Pokemon don't pan out, huh? I am teen Magma and I tried but didn't know how. So instead I'm just going Well I have a problem. None of you can learn dive. Crap. Well, the only flying type have access to, that can learn dive is Gyarados. And I know I said I wasn't going to use it because it can't really Well, it's come to this. This will work. There we go. You shall be known as Skydive. You get it? All right.

I've arrived in Isotopology City. Oh God. Oh God. The two legendary Pokemon, - Hello. - Feeling like Groudon's, getting to the shorter end of the stick here. Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me. Would you like to hear about You can start fighting... for the sky. I've been put into the cave of origin to talk to some guy named Wallace. But there aren't just two There's one more somewhere. Could it be? It's Ray-quay-quay. the two combatants in the distant past. I can calm them down with Rayquaza and then when they're out of It's finally time I can Rayquaza, the beautiful, Join me. Fight by my side to We will work fant- Where did you go? Maybe I shouldn't have judged Maxie and Archie so harshly. Rayquaza. Rayquaza come back. Fight to by my side, Oh, okay. I guess you're going to That's that makes sense. It's beautiful, Rayquaza within the sky. Is the sky expanding? Look at that. There's a hole. It's opening up, but he's coming down. Oh, oh I'm emotional. It's so beautiful. This is why team Sky was created. Yes. Get those losers out of the way. We don't care about them. Join me Rayquaza. Join me. Yes and oh, he's gone again. Well, tried to get Rayquaza to join me and expand the sky and it flew off. I tried once again and it So clearly I've learned the same lesson that the other team leaders had to learn. And that is that trying Pokemon is a fool's errand. So there's no point in me trying again. Just kidding. Let's go get this fricking snake. Rayquaza. I'm coming for you, again. It is I, Mikey, the leader of team Sky. You've run for me twice but I need you. You are going to join using your ancient whatever that means. Are you ready for the fight of your life?

I'm throwing the master ball. I don't know why Archie It was in his office, but there we go. I got Rayquaza. Let's go team Sky. You and I will expand the sky together. I'm going to call you Sounds cool. Now, even though I have Rayquaza I am not quite ready Because in my new world I want people to respect me, not just for the fact that I expanded But also for my battling power. So to prove myself might as well just go ahead and reach the highest peaks possible And to do that, I gotta Hello, hon. When your ice types are Yes. Go team Sky. The final stepping stone. Soon team sky will not only but the champion titled. A Critical hit. Oh crap. Oh my God. I can't land anything. All right, finally. Okay. All right. Phoebe. One down, two down and done.
