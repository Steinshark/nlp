But this guy had a flare for the dramatic. I think you're gonna enjoy it. - Okay, alright. - Let's get into it. Starting in 1918, over a the city of New Orleans, were rocked by a serial killer that would later go by The Axeman was the lurking in the shadows of New Orleans. Almost exclusively attacking at night. And is possibly responsible In chilling fashion, he only seemed to strike people while they slept in their beds. - [Shane] I love this right off the bat. - [Ryan] What do you love about it? - [Shane] Well, I love... I'll tell you what. I love it when serial killers I don't approve of serial killers. But I think, if you're gonna you might as well have some fun with it. - [Ryan] I feel like you have You-- - [Shane] I absolutely do not. They don't make serial killer Do they? - [Ryan] If they did, - [Shane] You would own - [Ryan] No, I think I'd own them-- - [Shane] You'd be like, &quot;I'll trade you a Gacy for a...&quot; - [Ryan] &quot;I'll trade you - [Shane] Yeah. - [Ryan] The Axeman eerily He only used what he could find on hand, in the victim's households. Usually an axe, which at the scene of the crime. - [Shane] Everybody had an - [Ryan] Yeah, you know, my biggest takeaway from this case is, why not just throw your axe away? - [Shane] Throw your axe away? - [Ryan] Yeah, that's literally But, these people are like, &quot;err, leave the axe in the shed.&quot; - [Shane] &quot;Hope he doesn't take my axe.&quot; (laughing) - [Ryan] I know. - [Shane] &quot;I've got my my kitchen axe.&quot; (laughing) - [Ryan] His creepy Let's get into the timeline. On May 23rd, 1918, at the first suspected Axe Catherine and Joseph Maggio were struck violently by an axe. A straight razor used on their throats. - [Shane] Wait, he hit them with the axe and then cut their throats? - [Ryan] I don't know. - [Shane] It also could've been his, since it was his first - [Ryan] Oh, he was dabbling - [Shane] If he was gonna be... He was like, &quot;Either I'll be the Axeman, or the Razor Boy.&quot; Razor Boy would be a - [Ryan] Razor Boy's not so-- - [Shane] Axeman and Razor Boy? - [Ryan] Axeman, I think, into my heart than Razor Boy. - [Shane] Lock your doors, (laughing) - [Ryan] Catherine had almost And Joseph had suffered The bodies were discovered who lived in the same house. Nothing was heard or seen. And no valuables were taken. The bottom panel of the All that was found was an axe. So he probably went back here, through the back door. Because that's usually how he did it. - [Shane] I assume the were the ones who were killed. - Some of them survived. And they would just report, like a large looming figure. Like a dark figure. So he really did become It kinda gives me the creeps. - [Shane] There are beads - [Ryan] That means New Orleans. Finger printing was around at the time. But was allegedly not A little over a month later, on June 28th 1918, near the corner of Dorgenois another attack occurred. A severely injured Louis were discovered by a making morning deliveries. - [Shane] That's sad for a baker. - [Ryan] They actually thought he did it. - [Shane] They thought the baker did it? - [Ryan] Well, I mean, That's why, if I ever found a dead body, I don't know if I'd call it in, man. - [Shane] You wouldn't call it in? - [Ryan] I'd call it in anonymously. I would not want any part of it. Because, that's the first - [Shane] But in today's you would be suspect number one. Because they'd be like &quot;Why'd - [Ryan] Well then, maybe trying to avoid dead bodies. How about that? Also, this guy didn't know. He was just delivering bread. He opened the door-- - He was probably like, &quot;Good &quot;Oh my god!&quot; (laughing) - [Ryan] Louis would And Anna would survive for Anna supposedly recounted to the police that a large white man, with The bottom panel of their And once again, a bloody - Another beautiful street though. - It is a beautiful street. The trees in this area are just so nice. - Sometimes even the most beautiful places hold the darkest secrets though. - Profound. - Okay. - [Ryan] Roughly a month later on August 5th, 1918, in an Mrs. Ed Schneider was found by her husband in the afternoon at their home. Mrs. Schneider was still alive, and rushed to Charity Hospital, and would reportedly survive the attack. Upon investigation, it was was missing from their shed. Mrs. Schneider was also pregnant. And I'm happy to report, that in the week following the attack, she successfully gave birth. - [Shane] Good for her! - [Ryan] Yeah, that's-- - [Shane] That's something. - [Ryan] That's a super mom right there. - [Shane] Is that the only axe baby, outta this whole story? - [Ryan] I think, yeah I think that-- - [Shane] Can you imagine - [Ryan] I don't, I don't - [Shane] I'd go around telling everybody, &quot;one of one&quot;-- - [Ryan] My mom took a-- - One of a kind, baby. Axe baby. - My mom took some hard and I popped out. - Jesus. - [Ryan] Five days later, reportedly near Tonti and Gravier street, 80 year old Joseph Romano Pauline and Mary after His head was bashed in. The two girls allegedly saw the attacker, and described him as quote, &quot;wearing a dark suit End quote. Joseph Romano would die two days later. - This guy sounds like the villain from Rocky and Bullwinkle. - Yeah he does. - I think it's, um, I don't know. I was about to talk outta my ass there. Are you gonna Google that? - I'm gonna look up a slouch hat. Because that sounds like something I need. - Right now, we're at the - You think the yellow house? - It may be. We just know it was on this corner. - Honestly, this Axeman might just like, could be a fan of quaint houses. - [Ryan] He's a fan of corners too. - [Shane] Not that it's but the elderly above all. - [Ryan] Yeah. Well, at least he lived - [Shane] No. You're right actually. - Well he didn't... I'm sure that's not how when he was picturing retirement. - Well nobody does. - Getting hit with an axe. - I rescind my statement. Maybe if you're gonna be a serial killer. - Maybe kill elderly people. - Kill the elderly. - That's a weird thing to advocate, but-- - I mean, but they've lived a long life. - That's true. Around this time, August 1918, the New Orleans (mumbles) quote, &quot;Armed men are keeping watch &quot;over their sleeping families &quot;while police are seeing &quot;of the ax attacks. &quot;Extra police are being End quote. And when looking at the For a while, that is. As nearly seven months the Cortimiglia family was attacked. Rose Cortimiglia woke fighting the Axeman. A fight that Charles would lose. Rose and their two-year old daughter Mary were also attacked. Rose and Charles would actually survive. But their daughter, tragically did not. In typical Axeman fashion, the axe used belonged - [Shane] Did they all it Axeman fever? Or Axe-mania? - [Ryan] Or did they call him Axie? - [Shane] Or were they like, &quot;Everybody in the town's got Axeman fever, &quot;as the terror continues - [Ryan] &quot;This just in, - [Shane] &quot;This just in, &quot;Wha-oh.&quot; &quot;Throw out your axes.&quot; - [Ryan] Five days later, a New Orleans newspaper received a letter from Quote &quot;Hell, March 13, 1919 &quot;Esteemed mortal, they &quot;and they never will. &quot;They have never seen &quot;even as the ether, which &quot;I am not a human being, &quot;but a spirit and a fell &quot;I am what you Orleanians, &quot;and your foolish police call the Axeman.&quot; End quote. - This guy's a Poet Laureate. (laughing) - It's incredible. Is this Robert Frost? (laughing) - [Ryan] He also goes on to Quote, &quot;they have been so utterly stupid &quot;so as to amuse not only me, &quot;but his satanic majesty. &quot;But tell them to beware. &quot;Let them not try to discover what I am, &quot;for it were better that &quot;than for them to incur End quote. - [Shane] This is very Old Testament. - [Ryan] It's like most serial killers like to stroke themselves, - [Shane] He was writing &quot;Mm-mm, let's see. &quot;the devil is satanic majesty.&quot; - Jesus Christ. - That'll get 'em. &quot;Time to go murder again.&quot; (laughing) - [Ryan] He also goes that he could be worse. Quote &quot;undoubtedly you &quot;a most horrible murderer, which I am, &quot;but I could be much worse if I wanted to. &quot;At will, I could slay &quot;for I am in close relationship End quote. - [Shane] Not to, not to discredit him, but he is killing people And, what's his success rate? - [Ryan] I gotta say, your isn't Johnny-on-the-spot. - [Shane] Yeah, you should be batting a thousand at that point. - [Ryan] You should be batting a thousand. However, the most important clause, is a specific threat that would terrify the entire New Orleans community. Quote &quot;Now, to be exact, at &quot;on next Tuesday night, &quot;I am going to pass over New Orleans. &quot;In my infinite mercy, &quot;I am going to make a little &quot;Here it is, I am very fond of jazz music, &quot;and I swear by all the &quot;that every person shall be spared &quot;in whose a jazz band is in full swing &quot;at the time I have just mentioned. &quot;If everyone has a jazz band going, &quot;well then, so much the &quot;One thing is certain, &quot;and that is some of those persons &quot;who do not jazz it on Tuesday &quot;will get the axe.&quot; - Jazz it. - Quote. - You better jazz it. - He turned jazz into a-- - &quot;Honey, we gotta jazz it.&quot; (laughing) - He turned jazz it into a-- - &quot;I'm not gonna throw out this axe, &quot;so we better jazz it.&quot; He's a bit like Santa Claus. - Okay, I'd like to hear how-- - First of all, he says he's That's a bit magical. - [Ryan] Sure. - [Shane] I can just imagine with his big axe riding a crocodile-- - [Ryan] A crocodile. - [Shane] Or an alligator, whatever they-- - [Ryan] Or a demon. - [Shane] Traveling on demon's wings, just looking down at listening for jazz. (laughing) - [Ryan] It's like he's like the Grinch, trying to listen to the - [Shane] Exactly right. - I still don't understand Santa Claus never bashed anyone's head in, with a big sack of toys. - That's true. But he does give them coal. - Wha-what? This letter would later spark the creation of a jazz song entitled Also known as the (jazz music) The Tuesday night mentioned in the letter was March 19th, 1919. It is said that the city as people blasted jazz And those who did not poured into local jazz clubs to stay clear of the Axeman's wrath. It's worth mentioning on March 19th, 1919. So, he kept his word. Apparently everyone was jazzin' it. - [Shane] You know what, he was probably just gonna be out of town. - [Ryan] He thought, - [Shane] &quot;I've got a - [Ryan] &quot;Let's see how &quot;I can make dance.&quot; - [Shane] Yeah. - [Ryan] On August 10th, 1919, in his home after he awoke to a man, next to his bed with an axe. Boca managed to survive the attack, reportedly staggering to a friend's home, who then called the police. Boca did not regain his memory, likely due to the blows to the head. - [Shane] Yeah, that'll do it. - [Ryan] Yeah, that usually does it. - [Shane] Yeah. - [Ryan] I once fell into a pile of bricks when I was a kid. - [Shane] What? - [Ryan] And I don't remember - [Shane] What? - [Ryan] Yeah, I was climbing because we were playing hide-and-seek. I was trying to hide, and I thought I had the best hiding spot. Turns out I was wrong, the branch broke and I just fell. - [Shane] This explains a lot. You fell into the-- - [Ryan] And after that, - I don't think it gave you the vision. - It gave me my eyes. - I think it put a hole in your brain. (laughing) - [Ryan] Later that month, on 2128 Second Street, was reportedly attacked by someone who entered When she regained consciousness, she could not recall So this is the site of And apparently, the house is gone. - [Shane] Yeah. - [Ryan] About two months later, on October 27th, 1919, at the corner of South the suspected Axeman attacked Esther and Mike Pepitone. Esther reportedly awoke around 1:00 a.m. to her husband screaming, Her husband's head was struck 18 times, and died two hours later. Esther saw two figures in the bedroom, but could not identify them By the way, two figures. - Razor Boy. (laughing) - Oh my god no. - He's back. - No, we're not-- - He's back from boarding school. (laughing) - [Ryan] A bolt with a heavy nut, something used to secure a circus tent, was one of the apparent weapons. There was a circus on the that weekend. - [Shane] Was this the last one? - [Ryan] Uhhh, yes. - [Shane] If this guy after getting struck 18 ties, the Axeman probably wasn't used He probably hit him once, and the guy was like, &quot;Oh boy, what a bump.&quot; And he was like, &quot;Alright, He was like, &quot;Oh my goodness, He was like three, four, five. - [Ryan] This takes us to the supposed end of the Axeman's killing spree. And with that, let's The first theory, is that were the work of the Axeman. Some speculate that the of Mike Pepitone, was Due to Pepitone's father Another Axeman attack that is scrutinized is the second attack on If you'll recall, Louis and his partner Anna Lowe, was However, Besumer was charged in bizarre fashion. Police found that Besumer back and forth, in Yiddish and Russian. They eventually came to the conclusion that Besumer was part or spymaster for the Kaiser. And the attack had nothing - A spy's not gonna bash - And then bash his own head in. - Right, he's gonna, from the ceiling, and put and let that poison fall into Right in there, they're dead. - Well, if they're sleeping, then why don't you just drop it into their mouth with - I don't know. It's what spies do. That's just what they do. - I've never... That's the first time I've heard that. - Everybody does that. - I think you made it up. - I did not make it up. It happens in a James Bond film. - Which one? - Um, the racist one. (laughing) Where he's in Japan. - [Ryan] Before dying, Anna Lowe allegedly blamed her partner Louis Besumer, and said that he was a Nazi spy. They also theorized that this case was a domestic dispute that Nonetheless, Louis Besumer was acquitted. There were definitely this was the work of the Axeman. Mainly the fact that it while they were sleeping with an axe. - That would take such an to be able to, you know, And then also... Like, I have a hard time - Though, you are a wimp. And if anyone would have mental fortitude to do something that would wouldn't they? - I just think it's very rich that you're calling me a wimp. - Yeah. - Because you hear a footstep, and you go into, &quot;Oh I - [Ryan] In vain with this theory, it's also speculated on the internet that some of the killings of the Axeman could have been the work of a copycat. The second theory, is that given the context some believe the Axeman to that could slip through tiny entranceways, and become the large man that witnesses described the killer to be. - No, no, no, no, no. - Just a theory. - Well, it's dumb. (laughing) He shrunk down like a little mouse? Is that what you're saying? - I, at what point did I-- - He's like Ant Man? He's like (mimics button) woo. (laughing) &quot;Now I'm big, time to die.&quot; - At what point... (laughing) The last theory is actually A man names Joseph Mumfre. To start on Mumfre, let's return The attack on Esther and Mike Pepitone. If you'll recall, Esther and her husband did not. Esther later moved to Los Angeles, and remarried to a man However, on the second anniversary of her former husband her current husband Angelo disappeared, and was never found again. Esther recalled that Angelo had ended business who went by many names. Including Joseph Mumfre. On December 5th, 1921, at 5554 East 36th Street in Los Angeles. He demanded $500 and Esther's jewelry. Threatening that he would quote, &quot;Kill her the same way he End quote. But, like a badass, Esther then - [Shane] Whoa! Good for her. - [Ryan] We've had two The girl who got whacked over the head, still gave birth and survived. And then, this girl who got threatened, and was like, &quot;Uh, fuck that.&quot; - [Shane] &quot;Well, you know what I'll do &quot;is I'll shoot you.&quot; (laughing) - [Ryan] This is the Joseph Mumfre to death. Kinda crazy to think that where the Axeman actually was killed. Good for you Esther. Shoot him in the face. - [Shane] Yeah, I mean, what more can you do. - If he actually, indeed, Whether or not he's the - [Shane] Yeah, face full of bullets. He had it coming. - Give him the bullet sandwich. Now, what does this have Given the fact that Esther was present for the Axeman's slaying of when Esther was arrested she claimed that Mumfre was the Axeman, and had seen him run from her bedroom, the night her husband was slain. The LAPD noted that there was evidence linking Mumfre to the And Esther was acquitted Here are some other things that seem to suggest Joseph Upon investigation, the police found that Mumfre lead a blackmailing that preyed on Italians. And almost all of the Axeman's - [Shane] This guy's a racist? - [Ryan] Most of them - [Shane] Whoa, fuck this guy. (laughing) - [Ryan] This is what made you turn? - [Shane] If there's already the basis that he's gonna be killing, but if he's gonna do it, - [Ryan] I think, just, how - Look Ryan, what are we here for? - I'm just-- - I thought we were here to get into the mind of a serial killer. - I know, I'm just saying, what if they all just happened - Oh, that's rich. It all just happened to be... Yeah. That'll hold up in court. - [Ryan] Mumfre was in and out And his time outside of prison coincided with attacks by the Axeman. That being said, there to directly link Mumfre to the crimes. And eyewitnesses can be wrong. Only circumstantial evidence Mumfre was the killer. If you'll recall, Esther Pepitone originally said there were the night her first husband was killed. So, either she's lying, or is the Axeman, perhaps multiple people? What do you think? - I think-- - That's it, by the way. - I think, it very well could be him. I know it says there's But that was sort of the sweet spot for serial killers, right? - I think it may have been - Yeah, that sounds likely. - Leading a blackmailing that preys on Italians. What a strange thing to-- - I've never even heard - What does a blackmailing gang do? - They just get together and they're like, &quot;I saw this guy fucking a goat.&quot; (laughing) - [Ryan] In the end, on the identity of the Was this the work of a series of copycats, or was this the result of For now, the case remains unsolved. (eerie music) If someone started in Los Angeles, it was like, &quot;If you don't play Bruno - &quot;You better play Bruno.&quot; - &quot;I'm gonna be very angry.&quot; - &quot;If you're not Bruno'ing - &quot;If we don't Bruno it...&quot; - &quot;Me and the devil (eerie music)
