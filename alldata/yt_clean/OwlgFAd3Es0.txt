I broke my cheap &quot;chinesium&quot; tap wrench I don't know what alloy it's made of But it surely is not the material I would use So let's make a better one Cutting mild steel round bar for the handle Using a steady rest to keep it from vibrating Center drilling for tailstock suporting Turning outside diameter I'm not using power feed because the half nut on this lathe is pretty chewed And I'm not looking forward to replace or fix it Turning the place where the jaws will mount Making the first pass on the thread for the locking nut Now with power on I think that's satisfying to watch Cleaning the burrs with files Cutting the threads for the fixed jaw Turning down the handle to about 12mm I made de hard to make features first Because if I screwed them up I would scrap the part at the beggining And save a bit of work turning the handles Filling it smooth And sanding it even smoother Now the other handle I made the other one first so the bar would be thicker at the base And thus flex less due to cutting forces Actually this doesn't need to be very precise Cutting off the almost finished part Facing the cut end Filing a fillet on it The other end too The finished main body of the tap wrench Lets make the locking nut Setting the power feed on Turning on the geared reduction of the spindle Here I'm trying to mimmic a knurling By making shallow threads on the outside One right handed and one left handed Now the internal thread Making the first pass by hand Test fitting The fake knurling turned out horrible But it works Now let's make the jaws wich will hold the taps I'm using a piece of truck axle wich I ended up learning is a very tough material The tool doesn't sound happy So I switched to a brazed carbide one Cuts much better I don't have carbide drill bits So I switched to a lower speed It's still very tough Boring the inside diameter Test fitting A bit wobbly but it's good enough I think I'm not gonna remake this part too... Making the second jaw This is also satisfying to watch And I ruined the tip of the cutter Boring again Checking the fit with a 15mm bar Had to change the height of the toolpost Trying to thread with a HSS tool made from a broken drill bit First passes by hand to check if everything is ok And... The tip of the cutter is already gone Look at the round tip. It was sharp before The HSS tool was not match for the axle steel So I tried annealing the steel to soften it I cut and annealed another piece Because It would be impossible to properly index the threads on the first one again It cuts a bit better now Tried another HSS homemade tool And failed again Failed threading attempts count: 2 Then I ended up buying a carbide insert tool Wich got the job done, but... This steel ruined all the 3 tips of the insert for one part threaded Anyway let's turn the outside of the jaws Using CA glue to hold the free jaw in place The glue coudn't stand the heat Checking to see if it's good enough It's not. Let's use the locking nut this time instead Pipe wrench to properly tighten it One side done The other is the same Both jaws almost complete Testing the assembly This fake knurling looks too bad So I made a smooth one Looks much nicer The opening and closing motion Scribing the place where the slots will be made Starting the slots with the hacksaw Now filling the slots by hand... ...because I have no milling machine... ... neither a milling setup for the lathe Made two different sizes Testing the fit on the tap shank Now the same on the other jaw You've seen enough of this Miraculously I managed to make them line up Finally the final assembly The fixed jaw locks on the threads The movable jaw is free to spin and slide back and forth The locking nut clamps the jaws together Holding the tap firmly I made this wrench for the locking nut so it's easier to tighten it enough Testing the smaller slot In the future if needed I can make more slots to fit other tap sizes Now lets test it I'm threading M8 holes on the lathe carriage The holes are to mount bedway scrapers that I made Thanks for Watching!!
