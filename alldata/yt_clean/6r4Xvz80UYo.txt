- Good morning, guys. Today we have quite an adventure traveling through Rust Belt territory, that being southwestern Pennsylvania, where, from my understanding, we're gonna see a lot of this, a lot of decaying, and remnants of the coal industry. (train whistle blaring) Now this is a part of the country that really did build up A lot of the skyscrapers the steel comes from A lot of these towns, have somewhat carved out. The jobs have gone, therefore But the beautiful architecture, I've heard some beautiful and also some of the people. And that's the most important part today. Get in with the locals and get a better understanding of what this part of America is like. Let's do this. (gentle guitar music) (train whistle blaring) (gentle guitar music continues) So many churches in this And you can see all the communities that originally came in here. So Greek, Catholic, I wouldn't have thought Syrian Orthodox. Greek for sure. Italians, Irish, Eastern Europeans, but Syrian, that was interesting. (train rumbling) Wow, look at the architecture here. There's so much potential in this town. So not long ago, these And you can imagine everything was a business here. I'm sure there was a strong community.

Did your mom make it? - No, we made it. - [Peter] You guys made it. - Yeah. That's a blue lemonade. Yeah, Brownsville. Total ladies town. It's pretty cool. Very simple. (gentle guitar music) Entering Uniontown. Looks like a megachurch Another fascinating historical town, which from the first glance, this looks really well taken care of. Clean streets, fresh paint. I read that it was one of in the late 19th, 20th centuries It was a coal mining town and provided coke for steel production. Look at all these abandoned places, that one's actually not looking too bad. I think it's abandoned, this Over here that looks like former courthouse with a dome on top. That would be a cool house. Really mixed up place as you can see. And so guys, I just looked on the map and realized there's this place that most of us have all seen. I can't believe it's close to here. It's 30 minutes away and it closes soon. So we're gonna blast And that's what happens when you leave a little and can be spontaneous and take the road that looks interesting and get lost for a bit. So definitely check out I need to get back here. This place looks fascinating, but we gotta get to our next stop. (gentle guitar music) (gentle guitar music continues) What an absolutely stunning So from those super interesting I'm gonna show you something here. This view is iconic. This is Fallingwater, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright for the Kaufmann Family. It was originally a summer camp complete with cabins, tennis court, running track, clubhouse The main house, this one, was built mostly by local craftspeople for a grand cost of $35,000 You can see it's just and the river going under us. There we go. It's gotta be amazing and this things really flowing. Unfortunately we can't get in. I didn't get the ticket to go inside 'cause they're sold out. What a place to spend your summer. - We've been very busy, and the tours are full usually every day. And especially since we've in July of 2019, along with seven other like the Hollyhock House, the Unity Temple. - [Peter] Okay. - And these were all bundled together to make a a bundle of eight - Awesome. All right. - So we're very proud to but no funding comes with that. Just a pat on the back and - [Peter] Are they paying you, Rod? - This is a paid position, yes. - [Peter] Good, good, good to hear. - Then that's a World Heritage position. - No, not the World Heritage. - No. Okay. to the pyramids, you can say you've been (water rushing) - Well this town has a than what we've seen today. Name of the town is Ligonier. And who knew that Southwestern I thought it was honestly gonna We've seen a little of that today. You gotta learn what the economy is here, or what it was 'cause, wow, what a different type of place. Downtown Ligonier, quiet Street. You guys from here? - Yeah. - [Peter] Why is it so nice? Do you know? It seems pretty wealthy. Like the buildings look good and no closed down storefronts. - Mellons, the Mellons keep it that way. - [Peter] The Mellon Trust - The Mellon Trust supports a lot of it. - [Peter] Okay. - The fire departments. - But beyond that- - The people care for it. - People care for it. from the banking days, right? - Is the same Mellon family? - From Pittsburgh. - [Peter] Okay. - All the people in Pittsburgh that used to wanna get out there was actually a train that came. - [Peter] Oh, okay, okay. - For the weekends they - [Peter] So old Pittsburgh money is keeping this place - Yeah, I think that's probably- - In part. - In part. - And I think the people that live here keep the money here. Does that make sense? - [Peter] Yeah. - Like if you need a contractor, you find somebody here that does the work. - But there are no jobs Other than gift shops - Well you got Greensburg and Latrobe. Latrobe Steel is working overtime for now. - Oh it's highly active, huh? - Just up the road, Latrobe Steel. - Or you have a lot of people - [Peter] Okay, work from home. But the steel jobs are good right now? - Yeah. - [Peter] They pay well, right? - Usually those are union And last I heard, guys - [Peter] They can't find people? - As like most places I understand. You know, they can't. But you also have a couple up out there near the airport in Latrobe. - [Peter] Okay. - You have the airport. You have, I mean, so this - [Peter] You know what I'm or maybe all PA, every town has a totally - True. - Like a totally different life. - This is very Hallmark-like. - Yeah. when you come into the diamond, it looks like a Hallmark movie. - You call it The Diamond. - Right now it's a little oily. 'cause there was a little bit of an oil spill today. (laughs) - [Peter] What do you mean oil spill? - In town, they closed because there was an oil spill. - Just past the circle. When it was founded, at one point, it was actually I understand, why it was- - And the Mellon Trust rebuilt that area. - Yeah, the Mellon Trust, - [Peter] Okay, so they're - Yes, when we bought our house here, they had first right of refusal. - [Peter] What do you mean by that? - That they watch. They don't want things to change too much is what I get from that. - Oh, okay. Okay, gotcha. (birds chirping) Mystery solved, it's is a lot of old money in this town. That sounds like that How you doing, sir? All right, next town, Johnstown. Just got some intel, very industrial, sorta sort of on its knees. We'll see. (gentle guitar music continues) That's still operating? - Yeah, still operating. There'll be like security - [Peter] Oh, okay. - To get in there. And I think this is the that's still operating, but yeah. (laughs) - [Peter] Do you work here? - I work crisis. So I work in the Central Park complex. This is the old Glosser building. - [Peter] Oh, that's cool. Are you helping kids or - Well, I crisis, so like suicidal, homicidal, they call me and I go out and- - [Peter] Okay. How are things for you these days? - It's actually gone down. - [Peter] Has gone down. - Yeah, has actually gone down. - [Peter] That's great. - No, I mean it's absolutely great. I do think that we help, because I've only worked But that's probably like one is coming to like kids. There's way more than I thought. - [Peter] Really? There were like, you know what I mean? Because if you're not Yeah, kids, like not a lot of kids, but like, you know, like some, like sad. - [Peter] Small town like this. - Yeah. - [Peter] How many people here? 20,000 maybe? - Yeah. - [Peter] It's quiet down here. Where is everyone? - It's almost like - [Peter] It's a ghost town. Well thank you for the work you do. - Yeah, no, I appreciate it. Listen, good luck around here. - It's very important. - I didn't have much to say. But yeah, that was some operation. And the trains are pretty cool to look at. - Okay. - When they all come by. - [Peter] All right, take care. - [Crisis Worker] Good luck! - [Peter] Look at this. We got an old United States post office. And when they built them I'm guessing this was built in the '20s. That's just a wild guess They did 'em really well, very interesting interiors. Can we see in? No, we're not gonna get in there. Look at this town. Churches, of course, and then it's just a ghost town down here. Just imagine what this could be. There are no new cities that It's impossible with the how things are laid out. You know, everything is, even and you know, a post office you know, it's so But imagine right here what Just people coming out of kids, laughter in the - But I heard someone go- - [Peter] What's up guys? You guys from J-Town? - Yeah. - I'm from Pittsburgh. He's from Johnstown. - Oh I'm sorry. J-Town's the place. - Yeah, it's the best I think. Yeah, I'm used to it. 'cause this year's my - 10th year? - Yeah. - How do you like it? - I'm gonna break it down for you. 'cause I'm my own person I like Pittsburgh better, It's way more stuff to do in Pittsburgh and way more stuff to look at. But Johnston's more quiet. more peaceful. More quiet. - And I like the quiet and the peaceful. Crime wise, the crime level got worse now. - [Peter] In Johnstown? - Yeah. It got worse over the years, The majority of Johnstown, it's mostly people who, you and who knows Johnstown very well, better than I do. And I used to work for on some post I still do now, but it's people from out of town that's making Johnstown bass. For the crime, - The drug line alternate Johnstown, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and cause overdoses and all that stuff. - [Peter] What's your name? - Kevin. Yeah, yeah, nice to meet you. - Yeah, nice to meet you too. All right, what are you up to tonight? - I'm about to go to one of with Johnstown to go to Pizza Hut to get my food for tonight. - You excited? - What are you getting?

That's part of my job for I help people every day. I'm nice to everyone. I respect everyone, I try to. Because in my hometown Pittsburgh, I grew up in the rough neighborhood, in the most dangerous So I had to learn to make some adjustments to be nice to everyone. - Yeah, you're putting - Yeah, definitely. I try to. And the vest, just to be on the safe side, is that what that is? - [Peter] Okay. - I'm out almost all the It's reflective. So I'm out in bad weather, so people can see me in the bad weather. Crazy driver. I'll be like, &quot;That's Kev.&quot; - Because nobody rolls like that. - Correct. - All right, take care guys. - All the best. We have an old grocery store, What is it now? Okay, game and hobby shop. - I'll take you on the whole tour. - [Peter] Let's do it. - So retail space up the front. We got game space back here. Tables filled with terrain.

Do you mind if I video your game here? Is that all right? - Yeah, no. - So large pulse hit, so we're gonna roll for - And then we've got more We have people that just or you know, some of the members, they'll come in and be like, &quot;Hey, can I just sit and have lunch.&quot; - Memberships here? - Yeah, yeah. So $20 a month gets you a membership, waives all your table fees. You can play as much as you want. And then it also gives you access to our members only room And then this is rentable by the hour. So this is our Dungeons and Dragons room. - D&amp;D purist out here. - [Peter] Okay, this is when - Very seriously. Flickering candles like these, they turn on, and they're - [Peter] Is there a big - So far it's all right. We're doing all right with it. - [Peter] That's cool, good for you. How long have you been open? - April 5th. - So not long. Hey, how's it going? - Good, how you doing? - Doing all right. Doing all right. - Good. to come in from Pittsburgh - I'd love for people to come in from Pittsburgh and other places. - [Peter] So you're born and raised here? - Yep, I love my life here. I love this town. I've never had the desire to move. - [Peter] Yep. - It's small enough for me, but it's also close enough to Pittsburgh, like getting to Pittsburgh's - Oh is that it? - I've been zigzagging all day long. Yeah, no, I mean hour and a half to Pittsburgh - Is about it. If you want to go to Pittsburgh Pen's game or a Steelers game, like it's not far. - You know, you can make a day of it. - Architecturally, it's a gem. This place is a nugget. - Yeah, yeah. A lot of the buildings 'cause everybody knows. Everybody knows what if this what these properties could be worth. And they're hoping that someday for what they think it's worth. And it's like, unfortunately, when so many of them are sitting - What do you think a in Johnstown? looked into buying the building. - [Peter] Okay. - And when the bank did the appraisal on, or I should say the insurance company did the appraisal on it, - Yeah. - They said to rebuild if it would like burn to But in this town it sold for 125,000. - [Peter] This sold for 125,000. - Yep. - It's beautiful, too, all - So yeah, like it's doable. It's just we're not a metropolitan area just yet. - So what do most guys your age do? Do they stay in town or they take off? - I would honestly say it's about 50/50. - 50/50, okay. - I think there's a lot that and then they eventually come back. Like there is a charm to this place. - Yeah. - There is honestly a cost of living. - Yeah. - You can make significantly less money than living in Pittsburgh - So what's an example of a house?
