MAN 1: NUMBER ONE, GOT-- JIM: IT'S TIME TO AS WE WALK, CRAWL, AND SLOG THE PASSAGEWAYS, SEWERS, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A BUT I WANTED TO DIG A HOLE IN MY AT THE SAME TIME I WAS AFRAID TO AT NIGHT. IT WAS EXCITING, A LITTLE BIT DARK UNKNOWN AND IT STILL IS. BUT IF YOU'VE EVER WONDERED THE HOLE. WHAT'S UNDER THE TRAPDOOR, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WERE MAN 1: OKAY, ESSENTIALLY WHAT BEFORE WE GO IN THE WHOLE IS PUT IT IN THE IN POSITION AND GO DOWN THE TUNNEL. JIM: OUR FIRST STOP IS A TO EVER BE ABLE TO SEE BU YOU WON'T WANT TO GO TO THERE. BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE FILLED OF OUR HOUSES AS FAST AS WE CAN. AT THE END OF THE 1990S WORKERS NEW SANITATION LINE FOR THE WHEN COMPLETE, THE TUNNEL WILL 5 MILES LONG. HOW MANY PEOPLE GET MAN 1: WELL, WE CAN NORMALLY BUT TODAY WE'RE GOING TO JIM: OKAY. MAN 1: OKAY. WE'RE SET. [MACHINERY NOISES] MAN 1: THEY'VE NEVER [LAUGHTER] JIM: SO, THIS IS MAN 1: THIS IS JIM: NOW, WE'RE WE'RE NOT GOING DOWN THAT FAR. IT LOOKS FAR FROM UP HERE. MAN 1: WE'RE GOING DOWN ABOUT 65 A LITTLE BIT OF GEOLOGIC TIME. [MACHINERY NOISES] JIM: IT ISN'T BUILT FOR COMFORT. MAN 1: NO, NOT FOR COMFORT, JIM: WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO THE PARTS OF HIS HUGE UNDERTAKING. THEY RUN A NARROW GAUGE RAILWAY TO MOVE OUT DIRT AND ROCK. THERE'S HIGH-VOLTAGE POWER LINES VENTILATION SYSTEM THAT THEY ARE DIGGING HERE, BUT OF MILES AHEAD. MAN 1: OKAY, WE GOT A NOT BAD. MAN 1: MORE DRIPPING. THE TUNNEL ITSELF WE'RE DRAWING THROUGH SO, AS YOU DOLL THROUGH AND WATER OR NATURAL WATER FLOWING HE ROCK. JIM: WATER IS FACT MAN 1: WATER IS A FACT OF LIFE. JIM: EVENTUALLY YOU GET TO IT'S BE CARRIED OUT BY A COMPLEX TO BORE THROUGH SOLID ROCK. THIS IS THE SQUEEZING AND YOU GO UNDER THE LONG CONVEYOR KIND OF MACHINE THAT ON A BIGGER ENGLISH CHANNEL. EVENTUALLY REACH, WELL YOU THE OPERATOR IS ABLE TO STEER RIGHT, ALTHOUGH A 90 DEGREE TURN BUT HOW DOES HE HE'S GUIDED BY A LASER BEAM. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET UP YOU HAVE TO GET IT'S A TIGHT SQUEEZE UP TO THAT CUTS AND DIGS. AT THE VERY FRONT, UP IS A THICK METAL IT'S LIKE A GIANT ROTARY CHEESE FEET OF ROCK OR DIRT EVERY DAY. LATER WE'LL SEE WHAT IT'S THROUGH TO DAYLIGHT IT'S ST. LOUIS HAS HAD WELL, WE HAD BEFORE THAT, BUT IT GOT SO BAD, SO THAT THE CITY HAD TO START SEWERS TO MOVE THIS IS WHAT THE RIVER DES PERES CIVIL ENGINEERS GOT TODAY IT IS MORE THAN JUST A THAT YOU SEE AS IT FORMS IT IS ACTUALLY A A RIVER ON THE TOP THAT YOU SEE AND THEN A SECOND RIVER THAT TO HANDLE THE SEWAGE. JIM: THERE USED TO BE A RIVER BUT SINCE THE DAYS OF THE HAS BEEN WORKED ON AND CHANGED WELL, YOU CAN'T REALLY TODAY IT'S CALLED A SYSTEM. A SYSTEM OF DRAINS AND A SYSTEM THAT IS SO COMPLEX ACTUALLY NAMED AS ONE OF THEIR THERE IS THE PLAQUE. THEY PUT IT UP HERE WHICH IS DOWN THERE. FOREST PARK STILL HAS ITS BUT THIS NATURAL BOOK IS AND DRAINS. [WATER RUNNING] JIM: WHERE DOES THE WELL TO FIND THAT OUT, YOU HAVE DISTRICT TO UNLOCK THE GATE AND WHAT I SUPPOSE IS THE JIM: YOU GO PAST THE WATERFALL, THE BICYCLE PATH. BUT THAT'S JUST THE FIRST OF SITES THAT MSD'S FRANK FRANK: RIGHT NOW WE'RE STANDING CHAMBER THAT WE HAVE A JUNCTION CHAMBER IS WHERE THIS IS ON THE WE'RE IN FOREST PARK OPPOSITE OR EXIT. BEHIND US IS THE GIANT 32 FOOT COMES OUT OF UNIVERSITY CITY. AND FROM HERE, TWO 29 FOOT THE STORM WATER DOWN TO THE CITY OF ST. LOUIS HAS WHICH MEANS WE CARRY BOTH THE WATER IN THE SAME TUBE. DURING A HEAVY RAIN OR DURING A THIS WOULD BE OR AT LEAST HALFWAY, [WATER RUNNING] FRANK: WE HAVE I GUESS INTERNATIONALLY. MOST RECENT TIME I WAS IN HERE THE ENVIRONMENTAL OR THE EQUIVALENT FROM AND HE CAME IN AND THIS WAS ONE TO SEE. WE ALSO DO VIP TOURS HERE. THIS IS A VERY GOOD PLACE TO IMMENSE OUR SYSTEM IS. JIM: THE RIVER DES WERE IN UNDERGROUND FOR THE TEMPORARY WOODEN CHAMBER. THE BIG CONCRETE IT MIGHT BE NICE TO HAVE A REAL PARK AGAIN. BUT WE SHOULD PROBABLY REMEMBER EVEN BACK IT AS ALSO A THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS DOWN TO BRING BACK UP. [WATER RUNNING] JIM: YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD THE OF A PART OF THE CITY. BUT THERE REALLY ISN'T THERE JUST CAME A TIME WHEN BEING A BIG CITY. YOU LOOK BACK FROM THE THOUGH AND YOU SEE THE MILLCREEK DOWNTOWN AND BEHIND THAT BARGE OF OUR CREEK. THAT'S THE MILLCREEK SEWER. TO GET DOWN THERE. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE PERMISSION METROPOLITAN SEWER DISTRICT PRETTY SNUG? MAN 2: DOES IT FEEL ALL RIGHT? JIM: YES. MAN 1: I'M GOING TO DOES IT FEEL OKAY? JIM: YES. MAN 1: TAKE IT EASY NOW. JIM: YEAH. YOU CAN ONLY GO EXPLORING THIS AND WHEN IT'S NOT THERE'S A WHOLE CREW OF PEOPLE AND READY TO BRING YOU BACK UP IN OTHER WORDS, A FLASH FLOOD. [WATER SLOSHING] JIM: TO ACTUALLY GET TO THE WHAT'S BECOME TODAY YOU'D HAVE NOW THEY'D BE CLOSED IF BUT TODAY IT IS SO LOW YOU CAN ARE STANDING IN THE NOW IT'S TIME TO TURN UP STREAM. IF WE KEPT WALKING THIS OR WOULD WE EVER COME OUT? FRANK: IF WE KEPT WE'D PROBABLY COME OUT AROUND AT THE END. VANDEVENTER OVERPASS AND THEN FROM THERE. SO IT GOES UP ABOUT JIM: THIS IS A NEW CONCRETE WE WANT TO GO FURTHER UP WHICH WAS THE SITE OF WHAT HAS EVENTS IN THE CITY'S HISTORY. A FORMAL DINNER PARTY FOR 200. IN 1916, THE DINNER WAS HELD TO NEW TUNNEL. THE MAYOR, THE CONSTRUCTION THEY WERE ALL LOWERED 100 FEET TUNNEL THAT BEEN DECORATED IN AND A KITCHEN. FROM CAVIAR TO ALL IN TOP HATS AND TAILS, TODAY THE VISITS ARE ONE OF OUR GUIDES AS JOB TITLE AND REPAIRS FAR UP INTO SEWER IN DIAMETER. [YELLING IN DISTANCE] JIM: WE'VE BEEN CUT A LITTLE STARTING TO RAIN. AND WHEN IT RAINS YOU SO THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING. WELL, IT CERTAINLY THERE WAS HARDLY ANY WATER DRIZZLING OUTSIDE. BUT THEY SAY IF IT'S RAINING ALL OF THAT WATER IS RUNNING FEEDING INTO THIS IT'S THIS BIG BECAUSE IT HAS CAN'T AFFORD TO HANG GOING TO BE THOSE TIMES. JIM: STAY WITH US. WE'LL BE EXPLORING MYSTERIOUS CAVES UNDER ST. LOUIS. JIM: FOR A LONG TIME TIME THERE ST. LOUIS THAT WAS NEARLY A CITY'S HISTORY. IN FACT, IT HAD PEOPLE WOULD SAY, DID YOU KNOW RUNS ALL THE WAY UNDER DOWNTOWN EADS BRIDGE? WELL, TODAY OF COURSE THERE'S ST. LOUIS THAT IS MORE POPULAR OLD TUNNEL. THE OLD TUNNEL WAS BUILT BACK AND YEARS AFTER IT WAS ABANDONED ITS USEFULNESS AND THEY PUT THE FACT THAT A SUBWAY TUNNEL KEY QUESTION, HOW DO YOU GET HAD AN EASY AND OBVIOUS ANSWER. IT WASN'T CHEAP, IT COST OLD TUNNEL BACK INTO SHAPE AND THAN ANTICIPATED. BUT BY THEN METROLINK WAS A DONE HAPPENED IF IT WEREN'T FOR JIM: THERE IS ANOTHER TUNNEL KNOWN THESE DAYS, IT COMES IN IT DOESN'T GO ALL THE WAY UNDER, TRAINS IN AND OUT OF THE IT'S NOT REALLY IT'S UNDER THE STREET. THAT'S TUCKER BOULEVARD UP UNDER THE TRACKS. JIM: IT'S SEEN LONG BEFORE THERE WAS METROLINK BY COMMUTERS AND JIM: THROUGH THE 1950S THE RUNNING ELECTRIC COMMUTER MCKINLEY BRIDGE AND IT WAS A SUBWAY, A YOU GOT OFF UNDERGROUND AND JIM: MOST DAYS IF YOU LOOK OUT TUNNEL WAS ABANDONED THERE'S STILL ONE GOOD AS YOU TRAVEL UNDER TUCKER OPENS UP ON ONE-SIDED YOU THE TRUCK GOES TO THE SEVERAL THERE'S REALLY ONLY PERIODICALLY A TRAIN ENGINE WILL WITH NEWSPRINT. JOHN: IT SERVICES JUST BUT AT ONE TIME THIS LINE FED THAT WERE THIS TUNNEL USED TO FEED OVER TO THERE WAS WAREHOUSES OVER THERE. AND IT KIND OF BUT AS FAR AS GOING THAT'S THE EXTENT OF IT. IT GOES DOWN ABOUT ANOTHER YOU KNOW, AT NIGHT, YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF SPOOKY YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S ONLY YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING YOU KNOW, ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. CERTAIN TIMES OF YOU'LL SEEING ALL BUT THERE ARE BATS AND IF WE HAVE THE DOORS OPEN THE BUILDING. WHEN IT'S COLD, THE WIND IS BLOWING IT'S JUST SMOKING HOT. JIM: THIS PLACE IS SOMETIMES AFTER SAMEUL INSOL, THIS CHICAGO HE HAD BIG PLANS FOR HUGE WAREHOUSE DISTRICT HERE. BUT BECAUSE OF THE DEPRESSION AND ALL WE GOT OUT OF JIM: YOU COULD TAKE THE STAIRS YOU'D MISS RIDING IN ONE OF THE KIND THAT USED TO THAT'S PART OF THIS BUILDING WILL FIND WHEN YOU REACH THE ELEVATOR SHAFT. WELL, WE ARE NOW ENTERING THE LARGE OLD ST. LOUIS BUILDING. WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY REASONS, BUT IT IS A LANDMARK AND THIS BASEMENT IT'S AN ALL DIRT FLOOR BUT THERE'S ROOM BUT ALSO ROOM FOR AND IN THE DARK DAYS OF THE INTERESTED BECAUSE OF THAT. BOY, YOU DON'T SEE DO YOU? THE OLD FALLOUT SHELTER SIGNS. THEY USED TO BE ALL OVER THE SUPPOSED TO GO IF BUT WHAT'S REALLY IT'S MORE THAN THE SIGN. IF I TAKE YOU OVER THERE I'M GOING TO TAKE LIKE ANY BASEMENT, THIS PLACE ALTHOUGH IT IS SO BIG YOU GET THE FEELING THAT THE STORAGE SPACE BUT YOU WONDER IF DOWN HERE OR WHY BUT THAT'S PROBABLY THE EVEN THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO STOPPED CARING ABOUT WHAT WELL, THE LAST PART OF THE TRIP GROUND LEVEL BECAUSE THIS WAS BOMB SHELTER. AND THIS IS WHERE, THEY'RE STILL WAITING FOR NEVER HAPPENED. THESE ARE BIG CANS OF DISTILLED TO FILL IT, HOW TO DISPENSE IT USE IT AS A TOILET. YOU'VE GOT, WELL,, LOTS OF DIARRHEA, TABLETS, A LOT OF A LOT OF COTTON SWABS. AND FRANKLY STEP THAT IF WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS WE KNOW THAT NOW, BUT I THINK THE PEOPLE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE THEY CAN DO TO PROTECT THEM. THEY WOULD HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF THERE'S A WHOLE STACK OF IN THE CORNER. THE TOP TWO TEN ROLLS OF TOILET BECAUSE ALL THOSE CRACKERS THAT AND THIS IS THE ONLY NOW WE OPEN UP ONE OF THESE. IT WAS PACKED NOW THIS IS NO LONGER THEY REALLY SHOULD HAVE SO NOT REALLY LET ME SEE IF I CAN HERE THEY ARE. CIVIL DEFENSE MORE THAN 35 YEARS OLD. THEY DON'T SMELL MAYBE WE CAN FIND [RIMSHOT] JIM: IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR FRESHER IN THE WAY CHECK THIS OUT. FAR DOWN BELOW GROUND IN AN OLD THE HOME OF KUNA SERVICE. THE COMPANY FOUND THE CAVES DUG LARGE AND NATURALLY COOL, A BIG FOOD LOCKERS. SO THEY PUT THEIR THEY'RE NOT THIS QUARRY HAS BEEN TURNED INTO MUCH HARDER TO FIND THESE DAYS THAT WAS BLASTED OUT OF THIS OLD, ABANDONED TRAIN TUNNEL PART OF ST. LOUIS COUNTY. THE TRACKS ARE GONE AND THE IS OVERGROWN. THIS WAS ONCE PART IT'S NARROW WITH ROOM FOR JUST THAT LONG. THERE'S LIGHT AT THE END OF GO INSIDE. BUT YOU CAN STILL SEE THE HERE BY THE LABORERS WHO PERHAPS THE MOST UNUSUAL TRAIN FOUND RIGHT ON THE IT RUNS YOU TO THE BUT IT STARTS UNDERGROUND. NOW, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE BUT NOT THROUGH THIS DOOR. [FOOTSTEPS] JIM: THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF ARCH, SOME FOR STORAGE, SOME FOR MUSEUM AND THE INCLUDING THAT MOST THE TRAMS THAT RUN [MACHINERY NOISES] JIM: SO IT'S THROUGH ANOTHER AND IT LEADS YOU TO THE FAMILIAR UNFAMILIAR BACKDOOR ANGLE. THERE IS ALL KINDS OF ROUTINE TRAMS AND ON THE SLIDING DOORS. BUT AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THERE'S A KEY PIECE OF MACHINERY DEPENDS, THE SUMP PUMP. CHUCK: WE ARE APPROXIMATELY 700 AS FAR AS WALKING DISTANCE. AND ELEVATION WISE WE ARE WE ARE IN THE PUMP STATION SEEPAGE COMING IN FROM THE RIVER LEVEL IT'S PUMPED OUT. BACK IN 1993 DURING THE FLOODS DAY'S TIME IS WHAT THEY BUT, WE WERE ABLE TO KEEP THE FAR AS FLOODING IN IF THIS CHAMBER FILLED WITH SOMETHING TO THAT EXTENT, IT THE LEGS OF THE ARCH AND INTO NORMALLY LOAD THE TRAMS. AND OF COURSE, THE TRAM SYSTEM SHUT DOWN. [MACHINE NOISES] CHUCK: WORST CASE SCENARIO, IF A POWER OUTAGE, OUR EMERGENCY PROVIDES POWER FOR FOR THE PUMPING STATIONS AND IF NOTHING HAPPENED, NO [MACHINERY NOISES] [MACHINERY NOISES] JIM: THERE ARE A COUPLE OF DISCOVERED UNDERNEATH THE SOLDIER'S MEMORIAL. THE BASEMENT HERE USED TO BUT THESE DAYS IT IF A DISASTER HITS, THIS IS MAN 1: THIS CITY EMERGENCY EMS ONE FOR A RADIO MICHAEL: LIKE IN THIS IS USED FOR 47 CONSECUTIVE THIS IS FOR ANYBODY THAT NEEDED WOULD CALL HERE AND WE TRY WE HAVE THE 800 MEGAHERTZ WE HAVE THE CAPABILITIES OF STATE OF MISSOURI. WE HAVE THE WASP LINE FROM THE WHAT'S HAPPENING. WE HAVE THE ACTIVATION OF WHATEVER IT IS IS MAN 2: THAT'S EMS, CEMA OUT. JIM: THE PEOPLE WHO SUPERINTENDENT RALPH WINKERT AND CRANNY OF THIS BUILDING, RALPH: WE'RE UNDER THE FRONT JIM: SO THE FLAT PART FROM RALPH: IT'S RIGHT UP THERE. AND THIS IS THE MAIN STEPS GOING JIM: THERE'S NOT MUCH HERE WOULD EXPECT TO THE REAL HIGHLIGHT OF THE THERE ARE LONG PASSAGEWAYS THAT AND LEAD FROM ONE CITY OKAY, THE TUNNELS BUT IT'S MORE FUN RALPH: SO HERE WE ARE AT THE A BLAST. JIM: WHOA. RALPH: FEEL THAT HEAT? JIM: BLAST OF HOT AIR. JIM: IT'S TOUGH TO GET INTO TO GET OUT. ONCE AN ESCAPED PRISONER GOT ENTRANCES AND THE JUST AFTER YOU COME DOWN THE ACCESS POINT. WERE UNDER SOMEWHERE I DON'T WANT TO BUT IT'S KIND OF HARD TO KNOW THESE LANDMARKS WHILE YOU'RE WHICH ARE EXTREMELY OKAY, SO, IT LOOKS LIKE WERE RALPH: YES, THE JUNCTION HERE THAT IS TO THE CIVIL COURTS. WERE ROUGHLY UNDER MARKET WE GO THIS WAY, THIS WILL JIM: RIGHT. RALPH: AND ALSO TAKE JIM: AND I CAN SEE THAT. YOU GOT SOME CHALK BECAUSE I IMAGINE IF YOU'RE EASY TO KIND OF RALPH: YES, YOU CAN GET TURNED VERY EASILY. JIM: THERE'S A YOU KNOW, STORIES AND GUESSES BUT I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THAT EXPLANATIONS AS AND I THINK WHEN YOU COME INTO ALL THIS. RANDY: IT'S STRICTLY FOR JIM: SO WE LIKE OBVIOUSLY WE'RE RALPH: GUESS, WE FEEL ELECTRIC, CABLE, YOU NAME IT, IS DOWN HERE. JIM: SO HERE WE HAVE DIRECTIONS TO GO, SOMEBODY HAS MADE IT NICE FOR US. CIVIL COURT'S THIS WAY. RALPH: RIGHT, YOU HAVE THE CIVIL JIM: WELL, I DON'T HOW JIM: YOU CAN WALK FOR QUITE A STIFLING PASSAGEWAYS. BUT WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW EXACTLY CITY BLOCK OR TWO, YOU ARE TURNING AROUND AND HEADING BACK. LIKE THIS IS GOING TO HELP MUCH. JIM: STAY WITH US, WE'RE GOING OF ST. LOUIS. JIM: OLD-TIMERS REMEMBER THE WASHINGTON FOR WRESTLING MATCHES PROFIT BALL BECAUSE THIS USED TO ST. LOUIS COLISEUM. BUT BACK IN THE 1800S IT WAS THAT YOUR UHRIG'S CAVE, WHICH POPULAR BEER GARDEN WELL, THE BEER GARDEN AND THEY'RE ALL GONE. UHRIG'S CAVE, IT'S STILL HERE. THIS IS THE ONLY ACCESS TO ALTHOUGH THERE BUT YOU WOULDN'T IN FACT, NO ONE'S BEEN DOWN TO THE SIMPLE REASON, WELL THAT FILLED FULL OF WATER. I CAN SEE THAT FROM HERE. [SPLASH] JIM: DURING ONE OF THE FEW CAVE, A GROUP OF EXPLORERS RECORDING RARE VIEWS THE ONLY REASON THEY WERE ABLE SEWER DISTRICT PUMPED OUT TEMPORARILY LOW YOU CAN SEE THAT IT DOESN'T LOOK THE UHRIG BROTHERS ENLARGED IT, FOR THE BEER STORAGE AND LATER DOWN HERE. THE CAVE BACK THEN WAS ON THE A FAVORITE PLACE THE CAVE WAS OPEN TO TOURS TURNED INTO A PLACE LATER THE CAVE WAS NATURALLY AIR BUT THE GLORY DAYS OF UHRIG'S 20TH CENTURY BEGAN. AND NOW UHRIG'S CAVE IS ONCE OF ST. LOUIS. PERHAPS ST. LOUIS IS BEST KNOWN FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS, UNTIL 1960, TOUR THROUGH THE BUT THE CAVE ENTRANCE HAPPENED THE BRAND-NEW INTERSTATE, ONLY A PORTION OF WAS DESTROYED. MOST OF IT STILL SITS UNDER HISTORIC DEMENIL AND THERE'S PLENTY OF BACK IN THE 1800S THE LEMPS USED FOR PLEASURE. [INDISCRIMINATE TALKING] JIM: MOST OF THE ENTRANCES TO SHUT OR LOCKED. THE CAVE EXPLORER EARL HANCOCK KNOWS IT PRETTY WELL AND CAN BREWERY ENTRANCES. SOMETIMES A GEOLOGIST OR A BROUGHT DOWN HERE. THE OFFICIAL REASON TODAY WAS TO PHOTOGRAPHIC MAN 1: SO WE PASSED JIM: BUT WORD SPREADS PRETTY AND MOST OF THEM SHOWED UP TODAY CHANCES TO GET INSIDE AND EARL LET US EARL, SO WE CAME BASEMENT - THE THIS IS A REAL CAVE OKAY, EARL, SO WE CAME DOWN EARL NATURAL SOLUTION CAVE. WHAT WE'VE JUST COME THROUGH WAS TO WHERE THERE'S VERY BUT WHAT WERE IN HERE IS THIS IS THE WORK THAT THE WATER JIM: HOW BIG IS THIS? EARL: THERE'S A TOTAL OF IT WAS NOT PRETTY THOROUGHLY DEMOLITION FOR THE HIGHWAY. AND SO THERE WAS 2,400 THERE'S PROBABLY 2,100 IT'S MOSTLY THE 12 FOOT HIGH, 20 FOOT WIDE. JIM: SO THIS IS PRETTY AROUND SOUTH ST. LOUIS? EARL: CAVES, YES. THIS LOOKS LIKE A THE WALLS ARE KIND OF DARK, PEOPLE IN HERE CARRIED TORCHES. THEY DIDN'T HAVE THEY WERE BURNING AND IT SMOKED UP THE WALLS JIM: NOW THE - WHAT THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS CAVE FOR BEER DOWN HERE AND KEEP IT COOL. EARL: IT'S COLD. JIM: THAT'S WHATEVER HE WAS, AFTER THEY BUILT THE BREWERY, OF THE CAVE. EARL: HE BREWED HIS BEER AND THE SOUTH LEG OF THE ARCH AND 1860S WHEN THEY STARTED BUILDINGS HERE, 1850S. SO THE FIRST FEW YEARS HE BECAUSE THE CAVES WERE JIM: RIGHT, HOW EARL: IT'S 57 DEGREES. THIS HOLE HERE WAS JIM: I CAN SEE THAT. EARL: THIS HOLE IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CHEROKEE STREET AND THEY USED TO IN THE CAVE. AND THEY LOWERED THE TEMPERATURE JIM: EARL, SEE PLENTY OF USING THIS GAVE HER YOU SEE A LITTLE BIT OF BRICKS, PIPES, BUT YOU STILL FIND EVIDENCE BEING MADE INTO A CAVE. EARL: IT'S STILL AS LONG AS WATER FLOWS INTO FORMATIONS GROWING LIKE THIS. THIS ONE'S PROBABLY JIM: WHAT IS THAT EXACTLY? EARL: IT'S A SODA STRAW. IT'S CALLED A SODA STRAW BECAUSE DOWN THROUGH THE IT'S FORMING A STALAGMITE ON THE GET LONGER. AND WHEN THIS END PLUGS THEN IT WILL START TO GET FATTER THE OUTSIDE AND DEPOSIT ITS JIM: AND YOU SAY HOW LONG TO WHICH IS? EARL: THAT COULD BE AS YOUNG AS 25 YEARS. JIM: SO WHEN PEOPLE GO SOMETHING LITTLE LIKE THAT, 50 YEARS OF WORK THERE. EARL: YES, AND YOU COULD POP IT YOU'VE BROKEN IT. JIM: YES, THIS IS A OBVIOUSLY A WALL BUT THIS ROOM BACK EARL: THIS WAS THE THEATER. THE LEMP FAMILY USED THIS IS A TO LAGER THEIR BEER. JIM: SO IS LIVE EARL: YES, I THINK THAT THEY HAD ACTORS ON THE COME AND ENTERTAIN AT UHRIG'S THE FAMILY DECIDED THEY PRIVATE LITTLE THEATER. JIM: SO THE STAGE UP YOU GOT - WHAT YOU HAVE IT HERE? EARL: THOSE ARE LIGHTS. THE LIGHTS - THEY HAD IN 1888. THE CITY DIDN'T GET SO THEY HAD LIGHTS THE RUBBLE ON THE GROUND HERE IS JIM: YES, YOU CAN THE BRIGHT BLUE. EARL: THAT'S A BAVARIAN FOREST JIM: OKAY. EARL: BUT YOU CAN SEE A LINE NATURAL CAVE CEILING, THIS LINE EXTENDED FROM THE JIM: WHAT WE'RE TALKING HERE IS TO THE CAVE, RIGHT? EARL: YES, THIS IS THE IT USED TO GO UP TO ADAM THIS IS THE ENTRANCE THAT THE THE SCENERY TO AWAIT JIM: NOW, THIS IS NOT EARL: NO, THIS WAS THIS SPIRAL THEY SLEDGEHAMMERED THE ENTRANCE OFF. JIM: WAS IT USED EVER ITSELF OR WAS IT BUILT EARL: I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK IT WAS IT'S - THEY - THE CONSTRUCTION THERE WASN'T ANY - THERE WAS ABOVE HERE. JIM: SO THIS IS JUST PART EARL: YES, IT WAS. ADAM LEMP'S HOUSE WAS JIM: OKAY. JIM: THERE WERE ONCE 50 BUT AS THE CITY GREW FILLED IN OUR CHEROKEE CAVE IS ONE OF EARL: WATCH YOUR THIS IS SLIPPERY. OKAY NOW, THIS IS - YOU'RE BELIEVE IT OR NOT THIS IS WHAT'S LEFT OF YOU CAN SEE THE EDGES OF I USED TO DOUBT THE THE POTENTIAL FOR A SWIMMING REALIZE THAT WHEN YOU HAVE UPSTAIRS YOU CAN HAVE A SPA. SO IT'S PROBABLY THE LEMP SPA SWIMMING POOL. JIM: SO WHEN WAS THIS WHEN WERE THEY USING THIS? EARL: THE FAMILY STARTED USING OH, IT WAS A FAMILY THING, IT IT WAS JUST FOR JIM: THEY HAD A LOT OF MONEY. EARL: A LOT OF MONEY. MAN 1: I THINK THE NEXT ONE THE PECCARY BONES OVER JIM: SOME OF THE FIRST SERIOUS 1945 WHEN A MAN NAMED LEE HE WAS THE ONE WHO BUT ONLY AFTER DOING SOME SURVEYING AND MAKING SOME MAN 1: THERE WE GO. EARL: HERE'S A PECCARY BONE WERE DIGGING JIM: THE PECCARY IS WHAT EARL IT'S A JAVELENA, IT'S A BORE WITH TUSKS. JIM: ALL RIGHT, OKAY. EARL: THIS ONE WAS A BIG IT WAS PLATYGONUS COMPRESSUS, NO LONGER EXISTS. JIM: HOW DID THAT JIM: THE PALEONTOLOGISTS SINKHOLE POND, WHICH THERE WERE COLLECTED THE DEBRIS OF DEAD AND THE CAVE FILLED WITH DIRT. AND WHEN THE VELOCITY OF TO FLUSH SOME OF THIS IT ALLOWED THAT SINK HOLE TO THE CAVES. AND WHAT THEY FOUND WERE LARGER AND THE PIECES OF BONE JUST SMALLER DOWNSTREAM. JIM: SO THEY JUST KIND OF ERIC: YES. JIM, THIS IS A JAWBONE OF AN IT WAS DISCOVERED A COUPLE OF IT THERE FOR THE FUTURE THAT'S ONE MORE OF THE JIM: NOW THESE ARE NOT THAT GOT WASHED IN, YOU'RE NOT BITS AND PIECES WASHED THROUGH. EARL: THESE ARE THERE'S NO COMPLETE JIM: ANYBODY STILL DO WORK HERE? PALEONTOLOGISTS EVER COME EARL: HOPEFULLY WE'RE IT'S BEEN 1946 WAS THE LAST 50 YEARS HAS GONE BY, JIM: EARL, THIS IS THE PART OF THE TOUR, RIGHT? ERIC: YES, THIS IS THIS IS A CHEROKEE CAVE TO HER. AND WERE COMING UP JIM: RIGHT, AND THE STEPS UP WAS ON PIN TO GET EARL: YES, NICE LEVEL WALKWAY. NICE WAY TO GO CAVING. JIM: THE THING THAT SURPRISED HOW BIG THIS CAVE IS, RIGHT NOW. IT'S FROM HERE TO THE CEILING, THIS BIG. HOW DEEP IS IT? HOW BIG IS THIS CAVE? EARL: WE DO WITH THE CEILING IS, TO A DEPTH OF 15 FEET IN SO WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT COULD BE A VERY DEEP JIM: SO THIS WOULD - THE TOUR HERE AND ON THE STEPS AS WELL. EARL: THIS GOES TO CHEROKEE JIM: SO IS A EARL: YES. JIM: FOR A LOT OF SAFETY AND OUT OF CHEROKEE AND OTHER BUT IT IS STILL IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE CITY IS MORE THAN ST. LOUIS GOES MUCH DEEPER JIM: WE NOW GO FROM THE OLDEST THE NEWEST. WE ARE BACK LOOKING DOWN AT THE NEW TUNNEL. THE WHOLE PATH OF THIS TUNNEL DEEP SHAFTS IN THE TBM OR TUNNEL GIANT UNDERGROUND GAME MAN 1: WE'RE GOOD. JIM: TODAY THE METAL SHAFT MACHINE CAN BREAK INTO DAYLIGHT. MARK: WHAT WE HAVE HERE COMBINATION HEAD MACHINE. IT CAN MINE THROUGH ROCK AND FROM THE MAGNOLIA SHAFT DOWN TO THROUGH ESSENTIALLY 800 FEET OF 400 FEET OF MIXED SPACE OF ROCK 800 FEET OF SOIL ITSELF. NOW THIS MORNING JIM: WITH NO ABILITY TO SEE WERE GOING, THE TUNNEL CREW [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] JIM: NOW THE TUNNEL BORING UP AND TAKEN OUT. THE TRACKS IN THE TUNNEL ARE THE MACHINE WILL THEN BE DRIVEN APART AND LIFTED UP USED BY SOMEWHERE THERE IS ANOTHER BIG MACHINE WILL BE TAKEN THERE, TO DO ITS WORK. [MACHINERY NOISES] JIM: WELL, IT HAS BEEN THAN A LITTLE I SUPPOSE THAT'S WHY KIDS KEEP ADULTS KEEP TELLING THEM NOT TO. I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOWEVER EVERY WITH PERMISSION AND ALWAYS WITH THESE PLACES THAN WE DID. BECAUSE AS MUCH AS I LIKE I REALLY LIKE COMING BACK UP. [METAL SCRAPING]
