Gosh, I bet you guys were hungry. - Uncle, you made this for real? / - Yeah. Okay, let's sit. Right, the kids have to eat. (Where is big sister eight?) (Where's Mom?) Where are you going, Mom? I'm taking Grandma to the hospital, so eat your dinner here. The big sisters are leaving now? Jaejoong has to watch the kids now. This is what Hyunyi wanted to see. Let's see how well he does. (Troubled) (A man born into a big family) Eight older sisters. A lot of nieces and nephews. I can't even find him. I practically raised these kids. He has 13 nieces and nephews. Nothing is harder than feeding your kids. Feeding them. I know I can be good at feeding them. It's going to be tough, but I don't think it's going to be hard. &quot;If you kids don't eat this now, I'll eat all of it.&quot; &quot;I'm going to eat your food.&quot; This will make the kids eat. This is guaranteed to work. (So confident) But he has to watch them by himself. - Right. / - Not just briefly. And three kids. Right, this is tough. Okay, he seems confident for now. - He seems laid back. / - Yes. He looks laid back now. Yunu, eat. Eat. Come here. He's backing away. (You rascal...) How about one bite? (Nope) Try a bite of this. Eat. This one was awkward around Jaejoong earlier. Yunu. Eat. Come on. Oh, he ate it. He ate it. He got his first bite in. (Confident) - It's good, right? / - His reaction... It has to be good. It's good, right? Surprising, right? Wow, it must be good. Have another bite. (Like he was pulled in by a magnet) - Two bites mean it's good. / - It's good - It means it's good. / - It tastes good. - Right. / - Since he took two bites. Looking good so far. This must be good for sure. He's more forward now. He likes it. Look at that. It's 8-3. Seol, here. Ah! Oh, she likes it. A bite for Seol. You're eating it. Good girl. (It's delicious) How cute. Look at her face. How cute. (He's good at feeding the kids) It tastes good. It must be good. They keep eating it. (Parenting is easy) Yunu, eat. He's going somewhere. (Seol lies down after taking two bites) (The kids are not interested in the food) She's rolling around. One is playing with the dog. Seol. It's looking... Oh no, they're lying down. Down after three bites. (Becomes a corpse) Yunu. Yunu. Yunu. Whatever. Yunu, if you don't eat this, I'm going to eat all of it. Whatever. Yunu, if you don't eat this, I'm going to eat all of it. (Really?) He reacted immediately. - &quot;If you don't eat it, I will.&quot; / - Will this work? Whatever. Yunu, if you don't eat this, I'm going to eat all of it. No! He doesn't want that. I'm going to eat all of it. No! - He said no. / - No. He's coming. I'm going to eat all of it. (No! Don't eat my food) No. No. I'm going to eat all of it. I'm going to eat all of it. I'm going to eat all of it. Yunu, you're going to eat all of it? I'm going to eat it all. (No) I'm going to eat it all. (Protects his bowl) He's protecting his bowl. (Miraculously starts eating on his own!) - It must taste really good. / - It must be good. &quot;I'm going to eat your food.&quot; This will make the kids eat. He really is a genius. You're a parenting genius, Jaejoong. - Jaejoong is good. / - He is. (They seem to be eating now...) Oh, he stood up again? Where is he going? Seol, want to try the eggs? (Seol rejects it) She suddenly doesn't want to eat. (No) This is what kids are like. - Moving around? / - If they don't, then they're sick. - They should move around like this. / - Right. Yunu. Eat a little more. (Nope) - No more. / - Why not? (Suddenly tries to escape the living room) (Runs away) Where are you going? He left. (Runs off) (Runs off) Seol. See? He's all alone now. What is this? (Chaotic) (Making him dizzy) - This is funny. / - It's funny? She brought a toy. (She's done eating) Seol, you have to eat. No, I... Have to study this. Suddenly studying. - You have to study this? / - Yes. No, you can study that later. No. No? (This is real parenting) Why aren't you doing what you said earlier? &quot;Sit down!&quot; Why aren't you yelling? Discipline. (An hour ago) He started talking in the middle of eating. Then he started goofing around. He can't do that. - Be firm. / - Right. - &quot;No!&quot; / - Yeah. - &quot;Don't do that!&quot; / - Right. Tell them like that. I'll show you what real discipline is. Do a good job. Mr. Discipline. Drill sergeant. &quot;Pick up your chopsticks and eat!&quot; Like that. Army-style? You'll see. I got this. (I'll teach them manners at the table!) He's going to show us. He was so confident. - Seol. / - Be firm. Seol. Seol, come here. Play with that later. - No, not this. / - No. No. He told her no. No, not this. No. I do what I say I'll do. Not this. Right, this is discipline. So cool. No, you can't have this either. (Cries) (Suddenly starts crying) (Yikes! It finally happened) It started. (Crying) (Hyunyi the mother looks very excited) Look at Jaejoong's face! - Why did you make her cry? / - Come on! Sheesh... I... (Crying alarm) - It's an alarm. / - Big trouble. Gosh. She's upset now. (He tries to comfort her right away...) It's going to take a while for her to stop. (So upset) Look at those big tears. Mommy! Mommy... (Wailing) She wants her mom now. Oh no... (Sheesh, Uncle...) You told her no twice and she started sobbing. (Troubled) Two kids started sobbing. (What happened to Mr. Discipline?) I can't even watch this. Oh no... (Geon tries to console Seol) - She's going to her big brother. / - Her big brother. She doesn't want her uncle. What happened to all that big talk earlier? Jaejoong, what happened? - Be firm. / - Right. - &quot;No!&quot; / - Yeah. &quot;Don't do that!&quot; What happened to being firm? Mr. Discipline. Where's Mr. Discipline? (Jaejoong is upset too) (A sea of tears) Yunu, go to Uncle. He said to go comfort Uncle. He told him to comfort his uncle. Come here, Yunu. (Backs away) Yunu... Is nobody on my side? Yunu. - He doesn't want to. / - Look at him back away. He's backing away. (Won't budge) Nobody is on Uncle Jaejoong's side. - Just the dog. / - Only the dog. - The Maltese. / - The dog is stepping all over his head. Only the Maltese is on his side. (Just look at the sky when times are tough...) What happened to being firm? Mr. Discipline. It's three to one now. I'm leaving with Gucci. (Mr. Discipline changes his plan!) I'm leaving. Bye. No. I'm leaving. No! Mommy... (They cry a second time) They're crying again. They're crying because I left. (Hurries back) Uncle's back! You made both of them cry. Uncle's back. Jaejoong made them both cry. - Both of them. / - He keeps making them cry. He left when they told him not to. He took it too far. When the kids start crying together, my mind just goes blank. Uncle's right here. I'm not leaving. (You're really not leaving?) - Gosh... / - Yunu, give me a hug. Give me a hug. (Hmm...) You don't want to give me a hug? (Nods) You don't want to? You don't want to? (Mr. Discipline is knocked down) He's not ready yet. This is so... Tiring. Kim Jaejoong fails. It really wasn't easy. Things didn't go as planned. (The kids didn't finish their food) (Sigh) Let's eat. Sit. Let's eat. Sit. Just one bite. (Geon starts feeding his younger siblings) - He's good. / - Look at that. Eat this. They'll eat it if it's from their big brother. Jaejoong isn't even in the shot anymore. - Not at all. / - How sad. You said you'd eat. (Geon is better at this than I am) - Thanks, Geon. / - Sure. You're all grown up. I bet you were like this as a kid too. As a kid... He started teaching me. &quot;I bet you were like this as a kid too.&quot; Geon is all grown up. - He's an adult. / - Gosh. I watched Geon when he was a baby. - Right. / - Yes. Now he's saying, &quot;You were like that as a kid too.&quot; Right, he's all grown up. (Uncle is choked up) (Big sister eight and Mom are home) Mommy's back. She's back. - Mommy's back. / - So happy. He's crying. Jaejoong is crying. What's with that face, Jaejoong? Did Uncle make you a nice dinner? - Respect. / - You're amazing, big sis. You're amazing. Mothers are amazing. Yeah. You're the best, Mom. You're the best, Ms. Mansun. The mother of nine children. She's the best. I totally respect my mom. Gosh, how did she raise nine kids? This is how you learn how a mother thinks. - Moms are amazing. / - Respect. - Of course. / - Moms are amazing. You shouldn't talk to your sister about discipline now. Now, I always tell her that I respect her. - Seriously. / - He's ready. I can tell that he's going to be a great father. Just get approved by his eight older sisters.
