[suspensful music] - That's awfully suspicious, isn't it? - Where have you come from? - Literally just down the corridor. - No, no, what task have you just done? - I'm not doing tasks, I'm telling you. I'm just walking around, I did 'em all the last - He's a waste of time, we might as well vote him. - Wait, why aren't you doing tasks? - When's the game of Among - Several times. - So you came from that - I did. Well, should we go over - Go do pin art, have you done pin art? Go do pin art, bro. - I haven't, no, thank you bro. - We should go this way. - Yeah, you go that way, Josh, I'll go this way. - sh*t, sh*t, sh*t, sh*t. [suspensful music] - Ow. - That was all right, that was me saying ow Where are cams? - I'm f*cked, I'm f*cked. As I was saying don't go into that. [Josh gasping] - Oh yeah, it's Chris. - Two people. - Double kill? - Well, it's definitely not Tobi and it's definitely not you. - Who's that leave, Randolph and Chris? - Blow the horn. - Bro. - That's two dead. - I can still jar him, I can save him. - Why don't we just - Call the thing. Ah, ah, ah, ah, staying alive, staying - Blow in his mouth, blow in his mouth. JJ, blow in his mouth. - JJ, give him the lips. Ah, ah, ah, staying - Can I just wait, can I just teabag. - No. - JJ blow the f*cking thing and everyone ends. - Wait, lemme just teabag. - No, no, not yet, not yet. - Let me teabag them. - We're here, we're here there's- - I know I just want to enjoy- - It's Randy and Chris left. - No, but if, oh yeah sh*t. - I want to enjoy that. - Oh. - He's alive, he's alive. His tongues out, he's kissed his arse. - The kiss of life. [JJ laughing] Wait, wait, wait. - Don't you. [JJ farting] - Oh sh*t. - The next kill can help us by the way. - Oh yeah. - If we are in here together, the next kill helps us. - Oh. [horn blaring] - Oh, dear Lord. What's happened here then? [people laughing] - I wonder Chris. Oh wow, shock. - The two body ladies and gentlemen. - Admittedly, this doesn't look great. - Wait, who's the- - But where was Randolph? - It looks bad in two ways, right? Because for one, that - Yes. - And we know that us three your face is on the wall. - Which leaves you two. - It's me, all right. - So is Chris. But then if it was one person, how did they get both kills? - Okay, hear me out, right real quick, I can solve the whole thing here. In the first round when Ginge and JME, Chris was alone with Ginge because I said to Chris, &quot;Come with me.&quot; - I mean, I was with Ginge a - &quot;I'm gonna go with Ginge, &quot;I'm not gonna come with you.&quot; - But I did say that. And then that was the first round and then Ginge was dead. - So where did you go when you left Chris? - Yeah, you saw me so you - I went to go with Danny, and then Ethan killed Simon, which we know is true now. So why would I be sus in that first round if I was saying the truth? - But Danny was saying it - Yeah, and then literally the next round, he was like, &quot;I lied 'cause Oh, so it's just obviously Chris then. - So you think there's only one killer? - Ethan definitely was a - Unless it's both of us. - The one of these dons was - Yeah. - Yeah, how- - But then Chris came from- - So I think someone got killed and then another person watching cams and another person came to look at cams and also got killed. - And then Chris came from cams. - Yes. - Well, the staircase next I wasn't- saw Danny in cams, Chris came into cams, they both ran off as if to I went up to do see saw and and by the way, it's hard. - The smartest thing for you, what you could have done, 'cause you're obviously the killer. What you could have - Take emotion out of this, yeah. - Kill one of us and then [imitates horn]. And then try and make us. - Hold on, hold on, hold on, cool down. - Yeah, but you can still self report. - But that's up to me and you, he would called him. - Yeah, the imposter can't kill two. - So you want cool down? - Were you guys together the - Yes. But we left Tobi right at the end. - So you were there the whole round? - Yep. With three of us doing pictures. Not the whole round, I left- - It's me or Randolph. - We had our faces, portrait. - Got you, got you. What I'm saying is Tobi wasn't - No, he went- - So Tobi could have killed - No, 'cause the bodies, we - Oh, where were the bodies? - Both of 'em in cams. - How'd you know that? - Because I literally walked Although Josh whistled - Yeah, because he has - Oh, is that allowed? - I mean go to VAR. - But not louder, not louder. - Well, you've changed Little hobbit. - Definitely me or you. - Yeah, it has to, because all - Yeah. - Who do you think it is then. [people laughing] sh*t. - Randy, look at me in the eyes. - You know what, it's fine, it's fine. - We shoot, play on- - We shoot again. [people laughing] - What could go wrong? - Okay, but I'm shooting Chris. - Whoa, whoa, don't spoil it. - All right start. - Three, two, one - Oh. - Well done, well done. - Okay, so it's Chris. - Well done, well done. - Chris, who are you? - I'm an imposter. [people cheering] - You bastard. - Oh no. Oh sh*t. [people laughing] - Sorry. - Victorious, you petty swine. - When I was like trying I was like trying to slow you down. - Yeah, I know, I know. I killed him about 10 seconds before. - So he killed Danny, I was literally walking into cams, bumped into him coming - I was just thinking of - We were chatting away. And then I saw Danny I out my bag to thing and - Caught him with his pants down. [upbeat music]
