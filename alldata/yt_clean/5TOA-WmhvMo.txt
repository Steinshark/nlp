Hello everyone This video starts with 'Mary' and 'Yass' bickering from the morning. Just a minute ago, they were totally getting along (really). 'Mary' is so light that she just flies away... Today is a holiday, so I'm going to have lunch and then study at a cafe! The menu is French toast 2 eggs, 200ml of milk, 2 tablespoons of sugar, a pinch of salt, and a bit of cinnamon powder. This is the milk bread I made last time, and I left it whole on purpose. I think I've seen it made whole at a brunch spot. They say it tastes better if you let it sit for a day, but I don't have time for that, so I'll just soak it thoroughly. Melt a piece of butter in the pan. Put in the bread soaked in the egg mixture. Cook it while rolling it around. Once the bread is golden, add maple syrup to the pan to coat it. This way, the outside gets coated and becomes sweet and crispy! I'll arrange it nicely on a plate. A sprinkle of powdered sugar It would be sad to eat just this, so I'll add ice cream I'll enjoy it with some cold milk. A bite of fluffy French toast. Is that the sound of me chewing the bread...? The inside didn't soak in all the egg mixture, which is a bit disappointing, but it's sweet and delicious! Eating it with ice cream is the best It's much tastier than just eating French toast alone. Thanks to the syrup, the outside is coated and crispy I had a simple and delicious meal :D I'm packing up to go study I'm the kind of person who can't use the laptop touchpad well... I absolutely need a mouse. I've been stuck at home too much lately, so I'll also do 88 minutes of cardio on such days. I decided to write our personal statements at the cafe with my friend! What I write as a personal statement, I read as a novel. The academy lasts until December, but I think it will be tough to get a job right away; I'm aiming for a job in the first half of next year. My self-esteem dropped a bit, but I'm back to being okay now. Studying at a cafe for the first time feels refreshing, and I plan to do it outside more often! For dinner, I came to eat the new bibimbap poke at Bonjuk &amp; Bibimbap! My friend is on a diet, so she was thrilled when I suggested we eat poke. They released three types: grilled chicken bibimbap poke, brisket bibimbap poke, and tuna bibimbap poke. I ordered the grilled chicken bibimbap poke, and my friend ordered the brisket bibimbap poke! The grilled chicken bibimbap poke has plenty of grilled chicken, barley rice, and vegetables! The brisket bibimbap poke is packed with brisket, barley rice, and lots of vegetables The brisket bibimbap poke comes with a clean and light oriental sauce! An oriental sauce that goes well with grilled chicken bibimbap poke is also provided. I'll drizzle it to my liking and mix it all up. I'll steal a bite of the brisket bibimbap poke that my friend is eating. The combination of the savory brisket and vegetables is truly the best The grilled chicken bibimbap poke has super tender and delicious chicken The vegetables are super fresh, and it's a meal with plenty of protein. The portion is generous and filling! It feels substantial enough to eat for lunch or dinner anytime without feeling heavy. It's light like a salad, but more filling than a salad, making it great for a meal! I enjoyed my meal happily and well It was a delightful outing... I came home and wrapped up the day by relaxing with cute 'Yass' A pleasant sea cucumber. Today's lunch is cleaning out the fridge. I'll toss in the frozen fried foods and rice cakes and put them in the air fryer at 180 degrees for 10 minutes. I'll make a sweet and spicy sauce! 4 parts sugar, 3 parts sesame oil, 3 parts ketchup, 2 parts gochujang. The cute 'Mary' is being adorable. Mix the sauce well. Add all the seasoning sauce to the pan. Add the heated fried foods and mix it. I crushed some savory nuts and added them. Spicy sweet fried snacks are complete Finish with almond toppings. I'm going to make kongguksu (cold noodle soup) to eat with it! Boil the somyeon noodles in cold water twice. Add a generous amount of kongguksu powder. Add cold water and dilute it to your desired thickness. Using kongguksu powder instead of soy milk makes it easier to store and tastes just like the one sold! Add some refreshing ice Add the somyeon that has been rinsed in cold water, and it's done~ I'll enjoy this! Summer is almost over, but I still have to eat kongguksu. The combination of chicken and kongguksu is surprisingly perfect. Kongguksu + kimchi is a winning combination Savory kongguksu pairs really well with spicy foods. It's thick and really delicious, like the ones you buy outside I enjoyed my meal! For dinner, I'm making shrimp tacos I'll make the tortillas from ground oatmeal. The ratio is 2 parts oatmeal to 1 part water. Put it in the blender and blend. Add an appropriate amount of oatmeal batter to a dry pan. It might be easier to shape if it's a little thinner! Flip it quickly and cook the other side. If you keep cooking it on low heat, it puffs up like pita bread. Let's make another one in the same way. Remove the tails from the thawed shrimp. Coat the pan with oil and add the shrimp. Add the sauce with chili oil and garlic and stir-fry. Add a bit of chili powder and stir-fry it sweetly. Avocado It doesn't look great, but I just took the good parts. Add the oriental sauce and mix. Mayonnaise + allulose + vinegar. Mixing it completes the makeshift taco sauce. On top of the oatmeal tortilla, add plenty of vegetables. Also, add the plump shrimp The shrimp taco is complete I made another one in the same way! Drizzle the makeshift taco sauce over it. I'll first take a sip of refreshing beer Since there are a lot of shrimp, I'll just eat the shrimp first. Even just eating the shrimp, the seasoning is really delicious It's my first time eating a taco. I'm not sure if this is how it tastes, but it's so delicious! Maybe I got a bit greedy with the ingredients, making it a bit difficult to eat Should I have wrapped it? But wouldn't that make it a burrito? Next time, I should go to a taco place to try it! As the weather gets colder, 'Mary' is now comfortably climbing onto the bed. Just one more month to wait, and she'll be melting into the heated mat. It's a test of patience. Wrapping up the day while relaxing with cute 'Mary' Today's lunch is butter chicken curry. Slice half an onion thinly. Since it's butter chicken curry, add a piece of butter Melt the butter in the pan. Add 300g of chicken thighs and cook them. Add the onion and stir-fry sweetly. When the onion is golden, add cream to cover the ingredients. Add an entire packet of butter chicken curry paste. Mix it well so that it doesn't clump together. Let it simmer until thickened, and the curry is complete I'll boil some pasta to eat with the curry. It's true that cooking rice is a hassle. Place the pasta in a bowl. Add plenty of butter chicken curry on top. Finish with a sprinkle of parsley. Sometimes, when 'Mary' is out of sight, 'Yass' cries looking for her. When I call her name, 'Yass' responds with her lovely voice. I'm having butter chicken curry after such a long time The curry aroma is really strong, but the cream balances it out for a smooth taste. It has an exotic curry flavor, which I sometimes crave. It's thick and so delicious Eating it with pasta for the first time, and it tastes great! I bet this curry would also taste good with naan After class, I stopped by the mart near my house. My goal is dumpling wrappers. I've been really enjoying "The Black and White Chef" lately, and I want to make the mala cream dim sum featured there. I'll thaw the shrimp and remove the tails. I'll chop the shrimp finely. Normally, spring roll wrappers are used, but I couldn't find them, so I'll substitute dumpling wrappers. Roll out the dumpling wrappers to make them thinner. Roll it up and slice it thinly. If I don't speed it up, my chopping will be this slow. I did my best. Since I've never made shrimp dim sum before, I added starch powder and salt to the shrimp. Mix it gently, and the dough is ready. Shape the dough into a ball and wrap it with the dumpling wrapper. Roll it around. This process is surprisingly fun. Rolling around. You need a tall pot with a small diameter. Once the oil gets hot, I'll add the dough and fry it. Roll it around until it's golden brown. To save oil, I'll use as little as possible and tilt the pot while frying. Once it turns golden, I'll take it out to drain the oil. For the sauce, I heard you strain the mala sauce with cream. I'll boil it down until thickened. First, elegantly plate the sauce on a plate. Then place the crispy shrimp dim sum on top. Sprinkle parsley, and the mala cream dim sum is complete In boiling water, add 1 coin-sized broth cube. It would be a shame to only eat dim sum, so I'll boil some rice noodles to eat with it! The recipe is 1 broth cube, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, Vietnamese chili, and bean sprouts. The super easy rice noodles are complete. I really love the visuals of today's dinner I'll dip the dim sum in the sauce and taste it first. The crispiness is insane The fried dumpling skin is super crispy, just like a snack, and the texture is amazing. Even made with dumpling skin, it's incredibly delicious, so I recommend it It makes me crave beer (even though it's non-alcoholic). The rice noodles are a bit lacking in flavor. It seems like adding 2 broth cubes would be perfect, but can I really add that much? The mala cream flavor is great without being overwhelming. I enjoyed my meal so much :D Snack time! This is a candy that increases liquid intake, but I give it to 'Mary' occasionally to prevent bladder infections! 'Yass' doesn't eat it; only 'Mary' enjoys it. I wonder what flavor it is... sweet...? salty...? It's one of the few snacks that 'Yass' won't eat. Good morning During lunchtime, I stopped by Daiso to pack bibimbap poke from Bonjuk &amp; Bibimbap! I'm looking for my feet while trying to wash them to clean the kitchen... Why are they only selling refills? I bought the necessary ingredients at Daiso and packed poke to take home I packed the tuna bibimbap poke, which I haven't tried from the three types. The composition of vegetables and barley rice is the same, with plenty of lean tuna. The sauce is sriracha mayo that pairs well with tuna! I'll drizzle the sauce to my liking and mix it well. Today, the water supply is cut off while they clean the water tank in the apartment, so I don't have utensils. My preference is to add all the sauce. Mixing the sauce makes it look even more appetizing I'll take a big bite. The spicy and savory sriracha mayo sauce is a perfect match. It contains carrot slaw, grilled mushrooms, chickpeas, and the ingredients harmonize beautifully! The crispy onion flakes also enhance the texture to the max I usually love salad poke, so I'm glad this kind of menu is available at Bonjuk &amp; Bibimbap. If you like tuna mayo, you'll definitely love tuna bibimbap poke! I had a hearty and satisfying lunch today! Here are the young radishes and leaf mustard I've grown for two months They're growing slowly, so I'm going to harvest them all today! They're young radishes, but they look like arugula. Now that soil farming is done, I'll grow them with hydroponics from now on I washed them thoroughly with water several times Chop one onion finely and add it. I'll add the seasoning based on my feeling. Anchovy sauce, gochugaru (red pepper flakes), allulose, vinegar, and minced garlic. Mix it gently. Making young radish kimchi with my mini vegetables. It's completed in the style of lightly salted kimchi I'll store it in a container, and I'll eat the rest with chapagetti right away Sprinkle sesame seeds to finish. Here's 'Mary' and 'Yass' cutely lying behind. Young radish kimchi definitely goes well with chapagetti. I wanted to eat old-fashioned sausages, so I'll grill them together. Slice them into 0.5cm thick pieces. 2 eggs Shake it up. Pour everything into a greased pan. Old-fashioned sausages need to be grilled roughly like this for more flavor. The egg coating is thick and tastes better Quickly boil the chapagetti. Leave the water slightly, and let it simmer. I was wondering whether to add a slice of cheddar cheese, but I'm going with the original. Instead, I'll have sausages coated thickly in egg. Drizzle ketchup~ Ah... Adding young radish kimchi to the chapagetti, I'll take a bite. It's seriously so delicious It's a perfect match The young radish is small and tender, so it doesn't taste spicy and is delicious! I've been craving scallion kimchi lately, but the young radish kimchi has solved that... I enjoyed my dinner deliciously :D It's 10 PM, time for resume and personal statement editing. I'm getting thoroughly criticized and turned into shredded meat. Wrapping up the day while healing with 'Mary' and 'Yass'... That's all for this video! Thank you so much for watching until the end
