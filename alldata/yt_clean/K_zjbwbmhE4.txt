- [Todd] Rashin Soodmand grew up in Iran where her dad was a pastor. He was, also, in the eyes of an apostate. Life was pretty normal for Rashin, until one day when she was 13 years old. She was outside their house, playing. - [Rashin] A car came and and we didn't know who they are, but after a few, ten minutes, I remember they invited my father to sit in their car and even I didn't hear the conversation, but I felt, &quot;It's and then sense of fear. (dramatic music) - [Announcer] Jesus never promised His followers an easy path. In fact, He told His disciples that the world would hate them. He sent them out as sheep among wolves. Jesus' words came true in and they're still coming true today in the lives of His Join host Todd Nettleton as we and learn how we can help, right now, on The Voice of - [Todd] Welcome again to The My name is Todd Nettleton. If you have listened to VOM Radio, for any length of time at all, you know that we love to tell you the stories of our brothers and sisters in the growing churches inside It's a place where God calling people to faith in Christ. It is also a place where so we like to let you know what it's like for believers there, so that you can pray effectively for them. This week we're going to hear Pastor Hossein Soodmand was He came to faith in Christ, he was ultimately put on trial and found guilty of apostasy by an Iranian court. They literally told him, &quot;You and you will be executed, or you can return to Islam. Just become a Muslim again and you can go back home to your family.&quot; Pastor Soodmand boldly said, &quot;I am a follower of Jesus,&quot; and for that crime he was executed. Today we are going to explore that story with his daughter, Rashin. I recorded this interview on back before anyone had back when getting on an airplane was a lot easier than it is today. But I wanted to revisit because it's such a powerful example of how persecution and especially as we approach the International Day of Prayer for Persecuted Christians, on November the 7th, I hope this will equip for our persecuted brothers and sisters, including the sons and daughters of those who may be facing Rashin was 13 years old when and I asked her what before that day. - [Rashin] The church was in so I could see the way he was especially people who and ask their questions about Christian faith. So my father patiently would answer all of their questions as well, and it was not just asking their question, he was care about them. So he had caring heart and loving heart, and I remember he had My father had pain in his leg, and he would cycle miles - [Todd] Are there things like, you know him reading you stories or him giving you hugs, or Are there things like that - [Rashin] He would with each one of us. He would take me to and had quality time with me, as well. Although he had quality but it was important for with each one of us as his children. So that is what is important for me when I remember him as my father. - [Todd] Do you think that he might not be able to be there when you were 20 or 25, or when you got married? Do you think he had any kind of a sense that maybe his life was going to be short? - [Rashin] I think he knew, because he was very keen and for us to be very independent. And always, he would tell us, or the way he was treated us, or he tried to raise us as children to be independent. And sometimes he would send us, my sister and myself, three children together, to a distant place with a taxi. He was not with us. He made sure that the taxi driver is safe, but he would send us by ourselves with just taxi driver, for instance. And I think now, when I thinking about those moment, and grow in being more mature, yeah, in our lives. - [Todd] What do you remember that he taught you, or how he taught you, what it means to follow Jesus, and how you live out that - [Rashin] So we had our every night, so that was And no one could cancel, (both laughing) - [Rashin] Yeah, even if we so we had a church in our house. Sometimes we had other They were welcome to join (both laughing) - [Rashin] So and then, (laughs) Yeah, he always teach us about God, and encourage us to read our Bibles, and told us stories about Jesus Christ, and what was incredible about Him. He told us about Jesus with the stories. - [Todd] So he didn't just he pastored his family as well. - [Rashin] Exactly, yeah. He pastors. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. - [Todd] We're talking today with Rashin Soodmand. Her father was martyred in Iran in 1990. Did you understand, even as a girl, that what he was doing was dangerous in Iran? Did you know that &quot;Well, my dad's a pastor, for our family&quot;? - [Rashin] Actually, not till I was eleven, because everything was okay, and even the church had this freedom to... Actually, I didn't sense (Todd laughs) - [Rashin] Or I don't know but I think everything happened from when I turned to 11. Because one day I was playing in our yard, and with other friends, and I remember a car came and parked front of our house. And we didn't know who they are. We were thinking maybe they came to (laughs softly) in order for him to minister to them, but after a few ten minutes, I remember they invited my father to sit in their car. And even I didn't hear the conversation, but I felt it's something wrong, it is. And then sense of fear. That was the first time he was arrested. So he was arrested for a month. And then, after that, after one month, they released him. They warned him, and they to think about his life. And they told him, &quot;Either ministry, and deny your faith. Or we will kill you.&quot; And that's the serious warning. And, because they (both laugh) - [Todd] So do you after being arrested that month? Do you remember what happened when he came through the door? Or what you thought when you saw that, &quot;Oh! Dad's home&quot;? - [Rashin] Yes, we were waiting for him because we heard that they It was around 2 o'clock, and we were actually preparing house for him, and cleaning. And yeah, when he came to the house, we were all crying, and yeah (laughs) (Todd laughs) - [Rashin] We ran towards him. So I remember the first person, actually ran to my father, was my oldest brother. He was actually cleaning the yard, and then saw, because my brother was very clean man, and he wanted everything be tidy, and so we were preparing house for him. So I... yeah, I clearly remember the moment he came to the house. And we were very happy. And we were thinking, telling to myself, &quot;I hope this is the last time that we are not having him, for this such a long time.&quot; - [Todd] Unfortunately, - [Rashin] No, unfortunately. - [Todd] One of the things, and preparing to come and talk to you, the church leaders, above your father in the Assembly of God Church, said, &quot;Maybe it's time for You've been arrested, There's more persecution coming. Maybe you guys should go outside of Iran.&quot; Your dad said, &quot;No, I'm Tell us a little bit about that. And he made some really about why he was staying. - [Rashin] As I mention, after the first time he was arrested, everything was changed. And we didn't have that freedom anymore. And then he went to and share all the inform... all his experiences with Brother Haik and other brothers. - [Todd] And I want to, give them some context. Brother Haik was the leader of the Assembly of God Church in Iran. And he also, later, would be martyred for his faith. So your dad went to Tehran, and sat down with Brother Haik and said, &quot;Here's what's happened.&quot; - [Todd] Then what happened? - [Rashin] Brother Haik, they realized that this is a serious ultimatum, so that they offered him a help. And they told him, &quot;We can help you to escape the country with your family.&quot; But that's my father's response; do you want me to read it? - [Todd] Yeah, please. My father replied, of the Great Shepherd of the sheep, Our Lord Jesus Christ. And I am ready to sacrifice For me to escape from this persecution would cause the hearts of my flock to become cold and weak. I never want to be a bad example for them, so I am ready to go to prison again, and if necessary, to give my life.&quot; Yeah, he said that and he left Tehran and he went to Mashhad. And while my father was in Tehran, they called to my mom and asked for him, and they told him, &quot;Tell And my father immediately left Tehran, and he came to Mashhad. He went house, and left her suitcases, and I was the only one with my mom in the house. And he told me, &quot;Rashin, I'll come back in two hours.&quot; And then, so I was preparing tea for him in order for him to come, and I can... help him and welcome him, but he didn't come back that day. After two weeks we heard that chilling news. That he was executed for - [Todd] We're talking today with Rashin Soodmand. Her father was martyred in Iran. So, Rashin, you heard after the fact. You didn't... there was never a time where they said, &quot;The court has ruled your Or, you know, &quot;Come and visit,&quot; or a court hearing, or anything like that? Was that unusual, or is that just how things work in Iran? - [Rashin] Yeah, that's Yeah, we had chance to When he was in prison for one month, and then when he was two weeks before his execution. We had chance to see him, once. And then, so I remember in the prison. - [Todd] What do you remember about that? Or what did he say during that visit? - [Rashin] Yeah, so it was (laughs softly) I was thinking what I should, I need to have my father with me. And why should I ask permission for other people to let So it was very joyful And so we just share our experiences, and we told him the stories and my father was just encouraging us to continue our study, and, yeah, encourage us to study, and look after my mom as well. So it was just very normal So he didn't want, actually, go to the details what because we were small children, and, yeah, he didn't want - [Todd] So what was that visit like as far as the setup? Was he on one side of glass, or one side of bars, or were you all in a room? Did you get a chance to give him a hug? - [Rashin] Yes, yes. Yeah, we were in the same room. So no, it was not a glass separated us. - [Todd] Okay. - [Rashin] It was, yeah, - [Todd] So do you think, at that time, that he knew, &quot;I'm going to be executed&quot; or &quot;I'm going to be killed&quot;? Or do you think he thought, &quot;This is like last time, they're going to hold me for a while and then I'll go home&quot;? - [Rashin] No, he knew that. He knew that, and while we were leaving the prison, the room that we met him, well, my younger sister, she, I think she asked me to look back. And yeah, my father was... he was in tears, and he didn't want us to see. And he was trying to (laughs softly) And I think my sister, she saw it clearly. And I think because he knew, &quot;That's the last visit.&quot; And also, after his martyrdom, we heard from some police guard, a religion police, that because another time, police... one man from prison came to our house and ask us to go to that place, because my father wanted to visit us. And we went to that place, and we stay, we were waiting for two hours in order to see him, but didn't happen, and after that they told us, &quot;He can't see you today, and we will let you And we were wondering, &quot;So what was the reason, the purpose for that visit?&quot; And after his martyrdom, he was in another room and they were showing him his family. It was kind of warn him that, &quot;So you have a option. and your small children, and your blind wife. And this is your fate. Now you have to choose.&quot; - [Todd] So it was one - [Rashin] Exactly. - [Todd] &quot;Okay, here's your family. They need you. Or you can go on with this crazy Christian stuff, or you can go home and take care of your family.&quot; - [Rashin] Family. Yeah. - [Todd] And so your father made a choice. - [Rashin] Exactly. Yeah. (laughs softly) He made the choice. - [Todd] So when you think about that now, what do you think about He chose Christ. What do you think about that? - [Rashin] Yeah, I'm very proud of him. And I'm very proud to be He chose Christ, although or ignore the painful and all the difficulties, and vulnerabilities so we face during that time. Especially, so we were small children, and with my blind mom because my father was not only father, he was a great help for my mom as well. Even on that time, although it was difficult for us, but we were very proud of him. And now I am proud of because, yeah, Christ is life, and, yeah, he knew that He's going to, yeah, God is going to - [Todd] We're talking today with Rashin Soodmand. She is the daughter of who was martyred in Iran. How did you find out, Rashin, that your father had been executed? - [Rashin] I was in school, and I came home, and no one was at home. And then after one hour, that was not normal. It was weird, so usually when we were coming from school, but it was... so it was After one hour they came because they went to the graveyard. On that day they informed my family and Brother Haik, and other pastors, he was executed, so they So when they came, I... When they entered the house, even, because they were wearing black... clothes. And then I just, immediately, I realized that &quot;Yeah, something happened to my dad.&quot; And then, yeah, everybody and told us that. - [Todd] So did Pastor Haik About, you know, &quot;Your dad's a hero; your dad has done this amazing thing&quot;? What did he say about it? - [Rashin] Yeah, Brother, the first person he inform us and told us was one of our and we were very close together, so she told us. And then everybody came, and Brother Haik. It was strange atmosphere, because it was between sadness and happiness. So sadness because no one expect that, even churches, expect that to happen. And I remember all the people were crying. And Brother Haik was sad because he loves his friend, his colleague. And also, as a family, we lost our father, but I clearly remember he would say, &quot;I'm jealous of him.&quot; (both laugh) - [Rashin] &quot;I'm jealous of him. I had to be the first one, to live... to give my life to Jesus.&quot; And it was... I could see the regret in his face, yeah. And then he was preaching very boldly, and powerful. I think that his preaching is still exist in the first day that we heard (interlude music) - [Todd] That's Rashin Soodmand telling us what it was like when she was just 13 years old and found out that her father had been martyred for his faith. I know all of us who are parents, just naturally, we care We care about their future. Rashin's life reminds us that, ultimately, God is in control, and He loves our children He has promised that He will take care of the fatherless. He will take care of the widow.
