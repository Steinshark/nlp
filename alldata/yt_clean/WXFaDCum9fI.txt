&quot;We'll deal with problems as they arise.&quot; &quot;Finally, someone's talking about this figure!&quot; &quot;Why doesn't he restore old buildings in Lviv that are part of UNESCO heritage?&quot; &quot;Please release the second part quicker.&quot; What else can I do if you're asking? By the way, a big thanks to everyone for your activity and comments on the previous episode. So I will continue. I'll continue telling you about Lviv businessman Hryhorii Kozlovskyi. After all, I promised to share more about his successful successes in everything he touches. - People love stories of success and business strategy... - Don't you consider yourself a successful person? If the name Kozlovskyi doesn't ring a bell, first, I'm hurt -- you missed the last episode. And second, it's unwisely. In my humble opinion, Kozlovskyi can easily be called the King of Lviv region. Why? Because it seems like everything revolves around him. Take a look: There's Kozlovskyi the investor, the developer, the restaurateur, hotelier, philanthropist, and football enthusiast. The crown jewel of his business empire? Kozlovskyi the tobacco tycoon. Another key chapter in his biography is his time as a deputy in both the city and regional councils. &quot;He's a flamboyant figure who often surprised Lviv residents, standing out with his bold statements and behavior -- like showing up with a militarized security team.&quot; Kozlovskyi truly is a striking personality, capable of turning architectural landmarks into restaurants, lakes into pools, and forests into luxury resorts. But he's also a highly influential figure, with connections extending far beyond Lviv region -- often making their presence felt in Kyiv, at least in some of its offices. Let's just say those connections play a significant role in his business successes. So today, we're diving into all of this. I'm Viktoriia Kovtsun, this is Bihus.Info, and once again, hello to Lviv. Where did we leave off last time? Oh, right. Vynnyky. Vynnyky isn't not just a suburb of Lviv, but also the epicenter of Kozlovskyi's business ventures. This is where it all began. And here is Kozlovskyi's crown jewel -- the Vynnyky Tobacco Factory. He joined as a customs specialist in 1994, became its head in 2010, and turned it into a true tobacco empire. &quot;I don't think anyone had even heard of the Vynnyky factory before he became its owner.&quot; Under Kozlovskyi's leadership, this empire regularly appeared in smuggling scandals, topped black market cigarette charts, but continued to operate and rake in billions. Legally, the factory no longer belongs to Kozlovskyi. We should believe that he relinquished his greatest asset last year. But here's the twist. He stepped down as a co-owner just before a major shake-up -- namely, a large-scale investigation by the Bureau of Economic Security. And stepping down as a co-owner? It's more of a technicality. The factory's premises are now owned by Kozlovskyi's daughter, and the new head is Rostyslav Pavliv, who worked for Kozlovskyi for years -- even managing his charity foundation. Although the commotion seems more like white noise. There were scandalous raids with clashes, seized goods, and halted production. But tangible results? None. Even the Bureau agents complain about pressure and mysterious expert evaluations. In short, there are more questions than answers. Just like I can't find an answer to why I'm holding this pack in my hands: "Vynnyky Tobacco Factory," dated 25.08.24. The issue is that in July, the Tax Service refused to renew the factory's license, and they're still fighting it in court. But beyond tobacco, Hryhorii Kozlovskyi has another successful venture in Vynnyky -- a 5-star resort, Emily Resort. Its story started with an objectively cool idea -- a Football Academy. For this, the local authorities handed over to Kozlovskyi hectares of forest around a lake for a symbolic price. Alongside football fields, an elite leisure complex with all the bells and whistles sprung up, and the lake turned into a pool. This &quot;paradise&quot; became a favorite spot for officials of various ranks. For more details about the BEB's adventures at the not-Kozlovskyi's-tobacco-factory and the gem of Vynnyky, his Emily Resort, I've already covered that. You may check the link below the video. I invite you to subscribe to our channel so you won't miss future updates. But Vynnyky isn't the whole story. As I said, Kozlovskyi is the King of Lviv region. And what kind of king would he be without interests in Lviv itself? - Don't confuse personal and business interests. - I don't hide that they're mine. I don't hide it. Yes, these are my personal interests. Alright, let's start with those interests -- personal, business, and political. Interests that are so blatantly and closely tied to profit that, surely, someone should have objected at least once. But no, in Lviv, these interests have never been denied. So, what's the secret to Kozlovskyi's success? Deputy/Investor Kozlovskyi served as a local deputy three times. In 2003, he first got a mandate, joining the Lviv City Council via by-elections as a member of &quot;The Party of Regions&quot;. 2015, he returned to the council as a representative of &quot;Petro Poroshenko's Bloc&quot;. In 2020, he moved to the regional council, also with Poroshenko's team. By mid-2022, Kozlovskyi voluntarily resigned, stating that "with the war, politics is not a priority right now." Before becoming a deputy, he wasn't a particularly prominent or noticeable figure to me. We underestimated the scale of his influence and financial backing, but when he entered the city council, it became very apparent.&quot; Being a deputy revealed Kozlovskyi's talents -- he truly stood out in this role. &quot;What, do you think we're idiots sitting here? Andrii Ivanovych, we understand everything!&quot; He was always at the center of attention: &quot;I like it and I want to defend them. Give us the list, maybe the two of us will manage better.&quot; And always had provocative statements: &quot;You steal shamelessly, people!&quot; &quot;Is he sick? He's been sick for a long time and hopelessly -- with his delusions of grandeur. And in this country, no one will cure this guy.&quot; &quot;This is a party of unhealthy people who decided to boost their ratings using the most popular deputy. There's no better figure than me for them to at least get mentioned.&quot; But beyond the drama, Kozlovskyi never forgot to look out for himself. Behind the polished facade of his years-long tenure as a deputy, he managed to gain a lot from the city. It seems he got everything he asked for. &quot;When there was a decision in his favor, we noticed that everyone voted to support it. Many issues were resolved through the city council -- land allocations, detailed area plans, dozens of such decisions, when Kozlovskyi or someone from his inner circle got some direct benefit from this vote. Of course, sometimes it didn't pass on the first try. If the media wrote about some questionable matters with constructions or some land, the decision might get postponed at the first session, but by the second or third, it would always get approved.&quot; To be honest, when I started analyzing all of this, it took me nearly a week just to list the number of companies registered under Kozlovskyi, his relatives, and friends. But... What's even more surprising is the amount of municipal property Kozlovskyi or his family acquired -- purchased, obtained for free, or taken out of communal ownership. And what's most shocking is how brazenly it happened. Just look: over the past 15 years, the Kozlovskyi family has come to own or use nearly a dozen communal plots, often free of charge. Not just plots on the suburban districts -- but prime plots in Lviv's historic center, part of the UNESCO World Heritage list. Along with the land, the Kozlovskyi family became the proud owners of thousands of square meters of historic property -- sometimes acquiring entire buildings. Let me show you visually to give you a better sense of the scale. Let me clarify upfront: when I say &quot;Kozlovskyi,&quot; I mean both him and his family. If we start breaking down who legally owns what, we'll quickly get tangled up. So, I'll keep it simple: This is Kozlovskyi's. This is Kozlovskyi's. This is also Kozlovskyi's. This is Kozlovskyi's. This too is Kozlovskyi's. And this too is Kozlovskyi's. This all -- yep, all Kozlovskyi's. It's getting dark, and I'm losing count but yes, this too is Kozlovskyi's. To be honest, I'm getting tired, here's something else. One of Kozlovskyi's methods for acquiring municipal land is to request it on behalf of a condominium association. The scheme works like this: they buy all the apartments in a building they're interested in. Then, as the new owners, they form a condominium association and request a land allocation. Naturally, they get it. &quot;If someone bought property on the secondary market and came to us, the session cannot refuse to vote. Why? Otherwise, it's a violation of the law.&quot; That's how Kozlovskyi acquired land for his first restaurant in the very heart of the city -- the Royal Brewery. He bought all the apartments here, formed a condomnium association, got the land, and began construction. The process was accompanied by protests and scandals. Architects claimed there were no permits and that it was destroying an architectural landmark. Kozlovskyi held a press conference, insisting the permits were in order but forbade journalists from taking photos. Photography was only allowed at the grand opening. &quot;Hrisha fired me from the Royal Brewery over cold dumplings. Honestly, not the greatest guy.&quot; Cold dumplings are certainly a reason, and for sharing that tidbit, a personal like from me! So, friends, don't forget to like and comment on the video. First, we read all the comments. Second, they help YouTube understand the video is interesting and share it with more people. &quot;I wanted to create a new format, royal format restaurant with great beer where every visitor would be addressed as 'Your Honor.'&quot; Kozlovskyi used the same method to acquire the bulding and land for his five-story restaurant directly across from the City Hall. You've probably heard of it -- it's the one with live sharks. - The person I felt most sorry for in that story was Andrii Ivanovych because he didn't speak to me for about two weeks because of it.&quot; - You mean Andrii Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv?&quot; - Yes, Sadovyi, the mayor, a very traditional man with classic views. Sharks and Rynok Square didn't fit into his sophisticated worldview. But the pool was installed, and that's a fact. There is no other way. Andriy Ivanovych just had to stock up on some sedatives and prepare to attend the grand opening. There was even an investigation into this one. The restaurant building is an architectural monument. However, let's say, only part of the facade was left intact. The Prosecutor's Office found that the restaurant's construction was carried out without permits. In 2016, Kozlovskyi was even ordered to restore the monument. &quot;Inside, in the end, we saved what we could because the changes they started making were truly catastrophic. In this case, we achieved the best possible balance.&quot; But let's be honest--despite all the scandals, the sharks, the kings, and the destruction of architecture, the condominium association scheme works. What happens after all the apartments in a building are bought up, nd an association is created to obtain the land? The land is either transferred to "their own people" or, alternatively, mortgaged. When the association defaults on the loan, the land is transferred to private hands -- of course, not unfamiliar ones. Meet the Grand Hotel, one of Lviv's oldest hotels and another pride of this family in the city center. A five-star luxury establishment. Yes, this is the same hotel where Kozlovskyi brought Paris Hilton for the grand opening and organized a royal costume parade with horses. But let's focus more on the property side of things. The hotel is currently being expanded, with plans to incorporate several neighboring buildings. An association was similarly created here to obtain and privatize the adjacent plot, which was initially designated for public use. The land was handed over for free. At first, the plan was to grant it for temporary use, but during a city council session, the wording was changed to "permanent use." To put it simply -- they outright gifted it. Of course, every association can get a free plot of land, just 300 meters from the Opera House, right? Notably, this land was granted to Kozlovskyi's family for free by the city council in 2019 -- when Kozlovskyi himself was a member of that very council. &quot;At the time, there was a common practice in the city council: vote trading. If Kozlovskyi needed something, other parties got something in return. It seems like deals were being made, so there weren't any disputes among the deputies.&quot; The initiator of what was essentially this gift to Kozlovskyi was his then-colleague in the city council, Liubomyr Bosanevych. &quot;If I had known they planned to build a hotel there, I wouldn't have prepared or presented such a draft resolution. At that time, I did not know anything about such plans.&quot; This, however, is the same Bosanevych who, a year before his &quot;I didn't know, wouldn't have supported it&quot; statement, was taking pictures with Paris Hilton at the Grand Hotel's opening. - There wasn't any municipal property there. The assets had been purchased on the secondary market. - But the land was municipal. - Yes, but the land was under those properties. There wasn't any free land -- well, maybe a small free plot where a tram stop was supposed to be, but now there's a fence there. So, the city council had no legal grounds to refuse. If the council had denied it, they could have taken it to court, won, and wouldn't have paid land taxes. That would mean no revenue for the local budget. - How substantial are those taxes? - Not very significant. This wasn't the only favor Bosanevych did for Kozlovskyi. It was he who introduced the project to lease land for Kozlovskyi's first private maternity hospital, which was planned to be built on the grounds of an existing hospital. Eventually, this project faced challenges -- people weren't happy, lawsuits followed -- but let's skip the details and focus on a telling moment. The medical center's building, on leased land, was registered to Kozlovskyi's son. No, correction: it was registered to his one-year-old son. That one-year-old then rented out his property to the private medical center that operates there to this day. Returning to the Grand Hotel: the story of the adjacent land didn't end there. &quot;Svobody 11&quot; condominium association obtained for Kozlovskyi's needs -- oops, sorry, for the association's needs -- three more free plots under historic buildings. These buildings are now owned by Kozlovskyi's children. And no, these buildings aren't near the hotel. They're scattered across Lviv's historic center. &quot;For one association to have property in multiple locations -- I don't recall anything like this in my years as a journalist.&quot; I can't possibly recount all the unique transformations of municipal property into Kozlovskyi's business assets, as we'd be sitting here for a week. Just know that a municipal cinema became an aquarium, and markets, like magic, shifted from municipal to private ownership. KOZLOVSKYI: THE DEVELOPER But when it comes to Kozlovskyi the developer, I simply can't deny you the pleasure of hearing this tale. So settle in -- this is the story of Avalon. No, not the mystical island, though there's a touch of magic here. April 2015. The Lviv executive committee approves the creation of a park on the grounds of a bankrupt oil refinery. But no park is built. By the following year, Kozlovskyi requests that the executive committee draft a detailed plan for this area. Reminder: at the time, Kozlovskyi himself is a city council member. However, the detailed plan seems to be personal. Somehow, the park plans now include a new residential complex. A company from the Avalon group was granted construction approval. &quot;I am Hryhorii, my last name is Kozlovskyi, I am a co-owner of &quot;Avalon&quot; company, and you can only demand your husband to buy flowers for you. Here, you are the public, and we are the developers. We can take your wishes into account to make this neighborhood attractive.&quot; Journalists from NGL.media picked up on the story, noting how the land meant for a park ended up under Kozlovskyi's family's ownership. The public outcry forced the prosecutor's office to intervene. &quot;They went to court to seize the land plot. By then, the official owner of the land was no longer Kozlovskyi -- it was his niece. She submitted a request to the city council to return the land to municipal ownership. It's almost laughable. By this time, residential buildings were already standing on the plot, and the city of Lviv could no longer realize the park project. The compensation was symbolic -- around one million UAH -- for the period the land was unlawfully occupied, and that was the end of it. This, I think, is perhaps the only instance where something was taken back from Kozlovskyi and returned to the city. It only happened because of public attention. The plot was developed by Avalon Group, which now has 12 residential complexes of various classes scattered across Lviv, with 6 more buildings currently under construction. &quot;I haven't seen a case where the city told Hryhorii Kozlovskyi 'no.' If he wanted something, it was implemented. I can't recall any refusals for Avalon projects or properties owned by Kozlovskyi's relatives. There were always loopholes. Even when the city's chief architect said during an executive committee meeting that something would be issued with violations, the committee members still voted in favor. It's unbelievable, but in Lviv, it's possible.&quot; - Has the city ever refused Kozlovskyi, his companies, or his family in any of their projects? - Look, I don't know about all the properties he or his family owns. But ultimately, when we know the initial intent, we do everything possible to ensure that the final building is optimal for the city of Lviv. These are complex processes. - Do you consider some of the methods for acquiring these properties to be questionable schemes? - If you're buying on the secondary market, it's hard to see schemes. You want to buy something, you negotiate. I don't think these people have any financial issues. As for auctions, of course, there's a desire to buy at a lower price, but market forces set the price. Let me point out, purely from a legal standpoint, Kozlovskyi himself does not appear in the documents of Avalon group companies. Although he publicly emphasized his connection to them -- attending local meetings near Avalon's future developments and representing the developer's interests in the city council. But suddenly... &quot;I have not been involved with the Avalon for a year and a half. I have no connection to this company. it's just a company owned by my friends, and I gain no financial benefit from it.&quot; Sure, we believe that. Although, purely subjectively, this sudden declaration of &quot;I have no connection. I t's a company owned by my friends&quot; reminds me of the scheme with the tobacco business, from which Kozlovskyi formally distanced himself right before a major investigation. What's the big deal? If the business isn't mine, then no questions for me, right? But I do have questions to ask. I wasn't able to ask Kozlovskyi himself -- I tried various ways to contact him. So, I have to find the answers myself. You know, I have an idea as to why all of Kozlovskyi's planned projects are so easily brought to life. Yes, I'm directly hinting at Kozlovskyi's influential connections. COMRADE, FRIEND, Avalon Residential Complex. Not the one built instead of a park, but another one -- this time premium class. The price per square meter, fully renovated, is $3,500. But such prices don't seem to bother local deputies and officials. A whole cohort of them ended up in this complex. And, coincidentally, apartments in this premium-class building were obtained by them at, let's say, highly advantageous prices. Of course, I can't skip the story about the apartment purchased during the full-scale war by the brother of now-former deputy head of the President's Office, Andrii Smyrnov. According to documents, a 100-square-meter apartment in Avalon cost him just over 1,160,000 UAH, while its market value at the time was about 6 million UAH. This lucky deal was highlighted by journalist Mykhailo Tkach, and, along with other assets of Smyrnov's brother, it led to an NABU investigation into alleged illegal enrichment. As fortunate were the relatives of ex-deputy head of the Tax Service in the Lviv and Kyiv regions, Orest Vityk. He's no longer a tax officer but a developer. His company is a loyal partner of all events organized by Kozlovskyi's Emily Resort, proudly mentioned on every banner. Apartments in this residential complex were also purchased by the wife of the city council secretary and Kozlovskyi's really good friend, Markiian Lopachak, the wife of a deputy and head of the European Solidarity faction in Lviv City Council, Petro Adamyk, and the family of Kozlovskyi's business partner, Oleksandr Svishchov. Svishchov's son, Vitalii, is currently a regional council deputy. What connects them all isn't just the Avalon apartments but also land and country houses near Kozlovskyi's estate outside Lviv. And that's not all the notable neighbors. I'm not implying anything, of course, but at least it's becoming clearer how Kozlovskyi's desired decisions breeze through the city council. The village council in Pidberiztsi, near Vynnyky, distributed 47 land plots for free. Among the lucky recipients was then-deputy Kozlovskyi -- and literally his entire family. "They try to live separately from others, creatring comfort space, so no one peers over their fences. Many wealthy people do this. And that's what they did. These free plots were privatized, some directly by deputies, others bought them later. They created their own private residential complex, so to say." In 2020, Kozlovskyi even gave a tour here. There's a dollhouse, football fields, and a farm. &quot;I call this the Parliament of the second convocation. The first convocation went, let's say, to canned goods.&quot; Once again, Kozlovskyi's neighbors are all "his own people" -- deputies and businessmen. In short, it seems like everyone in Kozlovskyi's circle occasionally makes decisions that are extremely favorable to him. Another coincidence, perhaps. It's probably another coincidence that Kozlovskyi's lawyer and essentially his right-hand man, Oleksii Riznyk, is a city council deputy and the head of the architectural commission. He plays a key role in decisions regarding construction, reconstruction, and permits. He even voted in favor of expanding Kozlovskyi's Emily Resort around Vynnyky Lake. It seems irrelevant to anyone that he himself owns part of the land and oversees some LLCs related to the area. Apparently, in Lviv, the concept of "conflict of interest" is foreign.

But now let's move on to even more influential friends -- those who had a direct impact on the country's governance and business environment. Back to Emily Resort. For some reason, the elite complex on the shore of the lake-turned-pool is particularly beloved by the Office of the President -- or, to be precise, by Yermak's deputies. Though it seems like a kind of "black mark" or something similar, as all these deputies are now former deputies. But that's beside the point. Since we've already mentioned Smyrnov in the Avalon story, let's start with him at Emily. At the onset of the full-scale invasion, according to Ukrainian Truth, this former deputy of Yermak reportedly stayed at Emily. One has to wonder -- did Smyrnov also get a "generous discount" on his stay at Kozlovskyi's complex, just as his brother did for the Avalon apartment? &quot;Mykhailo, I'll tell you more -- Emily Resort is a complex where... I don't want to list the names of everyone who's been there. Believe me, pretty much everyone has been there.&quot; Here in Vynnyky, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a former deputy of Yermak, stayed with his family a few times. After the President's Office, he moved to the Ministry of Defense, where he's as an official advisor to Minister Rustem Umierov. Those visits to Emily Resort led to problems for Tymoshenko with the National Agency on Corruption Prevention. Screenshots of reservations at Emily also appeared in the phone of the curator of the &quot;Great Construction&quot; project, Yurii Holyk, who has recently been visited by NABU for searches. And here's Zupanyn, a member of the Servants of the People party. Not in London, but back in his homeland. If you don't get the hint, you need to watch our investigation about his adventures in GB -- the link to it is on your screen. This time, the MP and his wife posed in front of the Emily backdrop. And that super-luxurious wedding of the former DBR employee and ex-prosecutor? It also took place at Kozlovskyi's complex. Besides the stars and a two-meter cake, there were some pretty interesting guests. The media mentioned that the newlyweds were congratulated by former tax officials, prosecutors, and heads of departments. And it seems that Kozlovskyi's lawyer--Riznyk--was there too. There was also another, no less telling situation -- again involving a deputy. But this time, it was the deputy of the Prosecutor General. It concerns Oleksii Symonenko. And once again, it's like a black mark, God forbid. Because Symonenko is now also a former deputy. At the end of 2022, Symonenko went to Spain to celebrate the New Year. What else is a deputy of the Prosecutor General supposed to do during the major war? But the point now is a little different, because he went there in Kozlovskyi's Mercedes, and accompanying Symonenko was a driver of Hryhorii Kozlovskyi. Hospitality, friendship, a generous Galician spirit, and the ability to make good deals -- an ideal set for a businessman. Especially for a businessman whose business is constantly at the center of scandals and investigations. What's interesting, though, is that all these neighbors, guests, friends, partners, or whatever they call themselves -- what do they offer in return to the generous Galician spirit? Although, I think I've already answered that question above. We're all used to the fact that a certain group of oligarchs... mmm... well, simply exists. It's there. A sort of Akhmetov-Kolomoyskyi constant. But has anyone ever wondered how oligarchs are &quot;born&quot;? How is that? They just live their lives, and then, bam, you control half the country? The story of Kozlovskyi, in my opinion, is precisely a sort of manual on &quot;How to Become an Oligarch.&quot; It's like a fragment from a melodrama script: you come to a tobacco factory as an ordinary specialist -- bam -- next frame, the caption reads "20 years later." And that's it, you're already the hero -- you've gone from being a specialist to the owner of the factory, and now you also have hotels, restaurants, and a resort complex. But what actually happened during those 20 years -- that's just the details, it stays off-screen. Although in reality -- all those years were years of leadership in the shadow cigarette market, endless searches, and open cases -- none of which ever really go anywhere. &quot;Luxury&quot; becomes a part of your life. So, to make it &quot;like in Courchevel,&quot; you throw tons of money at sharks, remodel architectural landmarks into restaurants, invite Paris Hilton to your hotel opening, pour concrete over a forest, and build a super-luxury resort. But this part gets murky. You promised one thing but delivered another. But who cares, really, when you're inviting everyone? Everyone from Lviv, everyone from Kyiv. A discount here, a favor there -- and suddenly half the prosecutors, the Presidential Office, tax officials, and local deputies are your friends, guests, neighbors, or even in-laws. You fund media outlets and erase critical articles about yourself. You own thousands of square meters, hundreds of hectares, dozens of businesses. Yes, friends, this is the birth of an oligarch. Shall we celebrate it or what? Though I'm certain there are also those who remain hidden behind the four-meter-high fences of Emily. Those who operate quietly, carefully, or simply don't get caught. Because the people who really keep this whole system running smoothly won't be taking selfies in front of Emily. So that's all for today.
