Hi, hello. It's been a while since I've been back to the streets of Paris. Since I came during the vacation season, many of the shops were closed. No matter how many times I see it, I always think the streets of Paris are just so beautiful. By the way, this time I rented an apartment through Airbnb. The kitchen is fully equipped for cooking, so I thought, why not make a French cooking video using ingredients from Paris? Even though it's quite early in the morning, I headed to the Bastille Market to get ingredients for breakfast. I want to make a Croque-Monsieur, do you have any cheese recommendations? For a Croque-Monsieur... Comte cheese? Comte is good, but I also recommend Abondance. This one here is Abondance. And... Would you like to taste it? Yes, please. OK. Mmm, delicious. Is this amount enough? Hmm, maybe a bit more. About double that, please. And I'll take some Parmigiano Reggiano too. The same amount? Also, can I get a pack of eggs? One pack? Yeah, one pack. So, after getting some delicious cheese, I headed back to the apartment. For the Croque-Monsieur, the only thing I could find at the market was cheese, so I bought the ham, milk, and the rest at a supermarket and bakery on the way back. The apartment I rented is really nice, fully stocked with everything you need for cooking. The bread I got is from a bakery recommended by the landlord, and all their bread is absolutely amazing. I'm a big fan now! This bread I bought is kind of cute and small, about a size smaller than typical sandwich bread in Japan. I really liked it. First, I'm going to start preparing the Bechamel sauce. I'll be using milk, flour, and butter. The butter here has a different flavor compared to Japanese butter. It's hard to describe, but it has a slight tang and the flavor lingers in a really nice way. Of course, the taste varies depending on the type of butter, but I personally feel that there's a subtle tang, and even after it's matured, you can still catch a whiff of its aroma. When making Bechamel, you're supposed to measure everything out carefully, but I just eyeballed it. Since I'm cooking in a kitchen I'm not familiar with, I might cut a few corners, so please bear with me! First, you saute the flour in butter until it's fragrant. Bringing out the aroma of the flour is really important to me. If you don't, the Bechamel sauce can end up tasting a bit flat. You don't want to burn it, but once you get that nice roasted smell, you add the milk to stop the cooking and stir it in to prevent any lumps from forming. If you add too much milk at once, it's easier for lumps to form, so at the beginning, it's best to be cautious and add the milk a little at a time. Once you get the sauce going, you can add more milk in larger amounts, but in the beginning, it's better to be careful. So, for anyone who tends to mess up Bechamel sauce, the key is to really pay attention to how much milk you're adding at the start. Since the sauce itself doesn't have any salt yet, I'll add some to taste. The most time-consuming part of making a Croque-Monsieur is definitely the Bechamel sauce, so once that's done, you can relax and continue cooking peacefully. Next up, the Comte cheese I bought at the market. Personally, Comte is one of my favorite cheeses. It's got a milky sweetness and a rich depth of flavor as you chew. You can find it pretty easily in Japan too, and it's popular because it's not too strong and easy to eat. I tried to slice it thinly, but it was a bit tricky to do at this angle. Oops... I messed up (embarrassed). The next cheese is the one recommended by the guy at the market. It's called Abondance, a cheese from the Savoie region in France. It's known for its fruity sweetness and a hint of hazelnut flavor. It's great to slice and pair with a light wine. I think it'd be amazing. Savoie also produces a unique wine called Vin Jaune, and it's really an incredible region. If you're curious, you should definitely look into Vin Jaune as well. Since I wanted to make breakfast, I headed to the market pretty early, around 8 or 9 in the morning. But even though it's summer, it wasn't all that bright yet. The sun usually comes out properly around 11 or a little past noon. At night, it stays bright until around 9 PM, or even later. So in the morning, the streets of Paris are really quiet. Of course, it's partly because of the vacation season, but it feels like time flows more slowly. When you're walking through the streets, you can really feel it. Anyway, I managed to slice the cheese, but as you can see, it kind of fell apart. This is something else! So, I spread butter and Bechamel on the bread, then added the cheese and ham. I wanted to enjoy the taste of two cheeses, so I used both Comte and Abondance in two layers. As for the ham, I didn't want it to be overwhelmed by the cheese, so I doubled up and used two thicker slices. After that, I put another slice of bread on top and moved it to the frying pan to toast. In the frying pan, I made sure to use plenty of butter and let it brown a bit to give the bread a nice crispy color. Pressing down on the sandwich a little helps too. After about two to three minutes on medium heat, check on it, and then flip it over. It's looking pretty good, right? Sometimes the butter isn't enough, so don't hesitate to add more if needed. Once both sides are nice and crispy, take it off the heat, prepare the oven, and then bake it to melt the cheese inside. I found this perfect pan with a non-stick surface, so I'm going to use it. Before putting it in the oven, I'll spread another layer of Bechamel on top. The more Bechamel you use, the tastier it gets, so I'm adding a good amount. Then, I'll grate some Parmigiano Reggiano over the top. Now this Croque-Monsieur is going to have a pretty luxurious flavor, with three different types of cheese to enjoy. I also wanted to have some salad, so I picked up some mache. Mache... that's what it's called, right? In Japanese, it's called mache too. This salad is really delicious. You can find it in most supermarkets, and I really like it. I also made a fried egg on the side. The Croque-Monsieur is ready, so I'll take it out of the oven and cut it in half. It's a bit hot, so be careful when handling it. Look at that perfect melty goodness. Absolutely perfect. And the plates here are so stylish, the food looks even better. To finish, I'll add some black pepper. You know what I'm talking about. Even the landlord knows how much I love black pepper. The sun hasn't fully come out yet, but this apartment still gets such beautiful light through the windows. I'm completely satisfied. The cheese flavor is just incredible. It's way beyond just a simple sandwich. Comte, Abondance, and Parmigiano... These three layers of cheese, how can I describe it? This is just... France, right? laughs Such a pleasant morning. I also made some eggs, so I can change up the flavor a bit. That's nice, right? If I put the egg on top, it turns into a Croque-Madame, so it's like a Croque-Monsieur-Madame combo! That works, doesn't it? I just had to say it. So, that was my Croque-Monsieur made in a Paris apartment. I'll be posting more from Paris next time, so stay tuned! Bey.
