Sorry, I know this is weird. It's my tea. I know it looks like a magic I have to drink this So it's true, it's kind I have to drink it why? Because I lost my voice. But it wasn't like weekend lost &quot;Oh, it was such a great party, I lost my voice&quot; Voice totally gone. What happened was I was A whole lot of performances and then one day, Out of nowhere, I was talking, and then, it's gone. Now Now at first I thought it was just but it didn't, it got worse everyday, Finally I ended in New York and was coming So while I was in London a horrible doctor because his advice was, &quot;Maybe you should just maybe you should keep quite, and there after, what speak in a confidential voice, yes? speak in a confidential voice.&quot; That's what he told me to do, a confidential voice is basically So basically everywhere you go you this is basically what you gotta do. Basically like white people in the office *whispering* &quot;What's that?&quot; see you guys at the braai, ha, ha.&quot; *whispering* That's a confidential voice.&quot; Now, the problem with is that you have to lean in when you speak to people, right? and then two things happen. but if you speak softly or you whisper people will whisper back to you. I don't know why this happens. I was trying to buy a computer. &quot;Hey sir, how you are you good? I was like, &quot;Hey yes, I just need &quot;Oh, you looking at some of I said, &quot;Yeah, just some of the laptops.&quot; He said, &quot;Yeah, well over here we &quot;What are you doing, why are you whispering?&quot; &quot;No I am not whispering, I You are whispering, why? It's like I am injured what the hell is going on here? The second weird thing that happened was because I was speaking like this some people thought I was Yeah, it was weird for me at first and then I realise this The worst incident was when I was and I went to the Chicken Licken it's a normal day, we're we walk up to the counter, the &quot;Welcome to Chicken Licken sir, I said, &quot;I would like four She's like, &quot;You want some chicken?&quot; &quot;I'm gonna give you the She was chasing me down the street, running away holding my chicken screaming for help in a confidential voice? &quot;Help me, help me, help me. So this clearly didn't help. I come back to South Africa and I who happens to be one of and he does an exam of my voice, Hemorrhagic polyp. and he says we have to go in for surgery which stresses me out, I go what? we have got to go in for the surgery? He says, &quot;Yeah Trevor, that is I said, &quot;what do you &quot;I don't want to have sex with &quot;You are going in for surgery.&quot; Surgery. Surgery, you know how scared I was now? Surgery, it was stressful. the worst thing about the surgery I wasn't allowed to speak for and then after surgery, Yeah, one month. No speaking, no whispering no humming, no coughing Nothing. You make no sound otherwise you will Which seems easy for the first few days Oh I will just keep quite, and then it gets boring and then it gets difficult. because then you start meeting people what Fans in the streets, friendly people you know. White people where the best to me, I wont lie. because white people are Yeah, white people don't have time White people don't like to wait, they are always in a hurry, They come up to me, &quot;Hey Trevor &quot;Oh what, you not talking?&quot; &quot;Oh, no voice? Gone. Out of my life, no stress. I loved it, I loved it. Great for me. Not so great for white people though, that's why they pay so much in traffic fines, yes. It's true, if you guys where just more Yeah, because black people hardly Black people get to the traffic you just relax the situation, you get there You know, the guy will come to your window, &quot;Baba, you are not wearing a seat belt&quot; and you are like, &quot;Ah, seat belt?&quot; &quot;Yeah, no seat belt.&quot; &quot;Eish, seatbelt?&quot; &quot;Yeah, give me your license.&quot; &quot;Ah, license?&quot; &quot;Hey, give me your license man!&quot; &quot;Ah, license, seat belt, license?&quot; &quot;Ah, license, seat belt?&quot; &quot;Hey man!&quot; &quot;Hey man, go, go, go, go.&quot; Just relax it. I have seen white people at They get angry at the metro cop. They get so angry it's like he did They get stop there &quot;Sorry sir, you where speeding.&quot; &quot;Oh bloody hell man, you nobody can drive anymore &quot;you guys are like behind every bush, I &quot;What the hell is going on here man!&quot; &quot;Jis like you guys, they should start What the hell! You guys in the bloody bush, you gonna &quot;No, I was just saying...&quot; &quot;Yeah, bloody hell. Just give me the bloody ticket!&quot; &quot;Oh, you want a ticket, I will give a &quot;Yeah, just give me the bloody ticket!&quot; &quot;Yeah I am going to give you the ticket &quot;Boom, one thousand!&quot; Just bring it down, just relax. just be a bit patient. White people have no patients, none. The complete opposite end of the spectrum, and the people I dreaded meeting when I had no voice was Indians. No, Indians are the worst human beings you will ever meet if you are trying to have short conversations I don't know what it is about the most inquisitive people you Question after question, after question after question, it's just like a thing in their culture. They have just got to ask questions Questions, questions, questions, questions. That's why there's no Indian You would not get anywhere. You would be fighting with your car &quot;Take me to Woolworths please&quot; &quot;Why do you want to go to Woollworths here boss?&quot; &quot;Just take me to Woolworths dammit!&quot; Questions and questions. I met a group of Indians guys one day it was a Saturday morning, these guys see me they very cool, the guy is like, &quot;Hey Trevor Noah, Trevor Noah? &quot;what's happening bro? How you doing man? Hey check this off, Hazier?&quot; Hey Hazier, you know this ou bro?&quot; Yeah, the comedian. We got Yeah, we bought them at Vorgeburg man.
