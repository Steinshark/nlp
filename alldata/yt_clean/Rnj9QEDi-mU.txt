ANNOUNCER: THIS PROGRAM BY THE FRIENDS AND PARTNERS JOYCE: YOU KNOW, IS NO MATTER HOW MANY MISTAKES YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP AND THE MORE WE CHOOSE THE MORE WE GET OUT [MUSIC] JOYCE: EVERYBODY WELL, AT LEAST, MOST PEOPLE DO. SOME PEOPLE YOU THINK COULD USE [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: WE'RE GONNA START HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF THEM AND GUIDED BY THEM, BY THE SPIRIT. SO OUR EMOTIONS THEY TELL US HOW WE FEEL. YOUR MIND DOESN'T NECESSARILY IT'S BEEN TOTALLY RENEWED YOUR MIND AND MY MIND AND SO PROBABLY PEOPLE TELL ME AND THEY TELL YOU TO EACH OTHER YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT WE THINK, AND HOW WE FEEL. I WANT, I THINK, I FEEL. WELL, INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, UNLESS IT'S CLOSELY GUIDED IS PART OF WHAT THE BIBLE WHAT I THINK DOESN'T NECESSARILY OR WHAT HIS WORD SAYS. WHAT I FEEL DOESN'T NECESSARILY WOULD HAVE ME DO IN A SITUATION, BE WHAT GOD WANTS. NOW, WE IMPROVE IN THOSE AREAS AND THE MORE WE LEARN BUT I CAN TELL YOU MANY, MANY YEARS, WHAT I CALL A MORE AND I LOVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT YOU CAN BE A CHRISTIAN A COUPLE OF TIMES A WEEK A LITTLE BIT IN YOUR WALK WITH GOD. WHEN PEOPLE GET SERIOUS ABOUT THEY'RE NOT JUST INTERESTED BUT THEY'RE INTERESTED THEY WANT TO BE THE KIND THAT GOD IS WORKING THROUGH THEM YOU KNOW, I LOVE DOING THINGS DO THINGS FOR MY KIDS I REACHED A POINT YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME.&quot; [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: AND YOU'LL GET TO-- AND THEY DO A LOT OF STUFF YOU DON'T--YOU KNOW, IS ALL ABOUT ME, ME, ME, ME, ME. WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME? BUT MATURITY BEGINS TO SEE AND IT BEGINS TO WANT TO KNOW WHO'S HELPED THEM SO MUCH. SO THE BIBLE SAYS WE HAVE THOUGHTS, DESIRE IS FOR US IS THAT WE USE HE'S NOT GONNA MAKE HE'S GIVEN US FREE CHOICE WHO HAVE NO CHOICE HE WANTS US TO COME TO THE POINT &quot;YOU KNOW, GOD, THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT, THEN PLEASE HAS ANYBODY STARTED PRAYING OKAY, THAT'S THE WISE WAY AND WE ALSO GROW EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE AND WE HAVE OUR OWN FEELINGS, AND GUIDED BY THAT IF THEY DON'T SO LET ME JUST SAY GONNA NOT HAVE FEELINGS. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE FEELINGS. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE EMOTIONS. AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE GOOD SOMETIMES THEY'RE THERE THEY--OR THEY'RE THERE SOMETIMES THEY'RE THERE WHEN YOU WANT 'EM; WHEN YOU DON'T WANT 'EM. YOU MAY FEEL LIKE DOING GO TO BED AT NIGHT, GET UP FEEL LIKE DOING IT ANYMORE. AND SO WE HAVE TO LEARN BUT WE CANNOT LET THEM HAVE US. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. WE HAVE TO LEARN AND BECAUSE EMOTIONS I READ AND STUDY IN THAT AREA AND I RECENTLY HAVE BEEN READING PROBABLY GONE HOME TO BE WITH BUT I LOVE THE FACT THAT MATTER OF FACT, A LOT I'VE LEARNED, I'VE LEARNED FROM YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AGO. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS SO MANY BOOKS AND THAT HERITAGE TO PEOPLE I KNOW THAT THE THINGS THAT AS VALUABLE A 100 YEARS FROM AND SO-- [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: BUT ONE OF THE THINGS AND IT'S NOT ANYTHING THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT I NEEDED AND MAYBE YOU NEED OF THIS TOO, TODAY. HE SAID, &quot;WATCH YOUR EMOTIONS THEY ARE AFFECTED IF YOU DON'T SLEEP WELL, EMOTIONAL THE NEXT DAY. IF YOU DON'T FEEL WELL, EMOTIONAL THE NEXT DAY. IF THE WEATHER [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: MY POINT IS, DO OR DON'T DO CAN AFFECT HOW OTHER PEOPLE BEHAVE WHAT KIND OF APPRECIATION OR DON'T GIVE YOU SO BECAUSE OUR FEELINGS BY SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS, A GOOD LITTLE STUDY CLASS PAY A LITTLE BIT OF ATTENTION AND WHEN THEY'RE DOWN TO BE CAUSING BOTH. SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE EMOTIONAL SOME HAVE, YOU KNOW, EMOTIONS THAN OTHERS. THEY SAY THAT WOMEN ARE YOU KNOW, THAT'S TRUE IT'S NOT ALWAYS TRUE WHAT GOD WANTS US TO DO IS LEARN EVERYBODY SAY &quot;DEEPER.&quot; JOYCE: BECAUSE THE FLESH, AND WHAT I FEEL, IS MORE AND IT DOESN'T REALLY MUCH TO DO WITH MY DEEPER LIFE BUT IT TAKES US QUITE A WHILE HOW MANY OF YOU, NOW LET'S SAY, 10 YEARS, BY YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES NOW OKAY, SEE, AND THE LONGER THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CASE. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE ALTHOUGH YOU-- YOU HAVE A FLESH WHICH THE BIBLE TELLS US THAT WE WILL NOT FULFILL IT DOESN'T SAY THAT THE FLESH BUT IT SAYS THE MORE GALATIANS 5:16, THE LESS TO THE LUSTS OF OUR FLESH. YOUR FLESH IS ALWAYS GONNA ALWAYS GONNA BE SCREAMING AT ME, THAT WE'RE GONNA DO WHAT NOW, DEEPER. THE BIBLE SAYS TO BE ROOTED DO YOU KNOW, WHERE YOU ARE SO CONVINCED THAT NOTHING CAN EVER NOTHING CAN TAKE THAT [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: BUT HOW MANY AND PERHAPS IN YOURS TOO, I DON'T DO THIS ANYMORE, DID EVERY TIME I HAVE TROUBLE I WOULD SAY, &quot;WELL, GOD, DON'T YOU LOVE ME?&quot; WE THINK THAT IF GOD LOVES TURN UP ROSES ALL THE TIME. BUT THE BIBLE ACTUALLY SAYS US IT'S A SIGN OF HIS LOVE. IN REVELATIONS IT SAYS AND FULL OF ZEAL WHEN GOD US WHAT'S WRONG WITH US. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU &quot;GOD, YOU COULD JUST LOVE I REALLY--&quot; [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: &quot;I DON'T WANNA KNOW WITH ME RIGHT NOW. JUST BE--FEEL FREE TO GO LOVE AMEN? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: BUT WHEN YOU'RE ROOTED THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU KNOW AWAY FROM YOU. THE BIBLE SAYS THAT WE'RE TO BE AND THAT MEANS WHERE YOU--YOUR IDENTITY IN WHO YOU ARE IN CHRIST DON'T WANNA BE REJECTED, YOU CAN STILL BE OKAY GOD NEVER REJECTS YOU. IF YOU GET TURNED DOWN THAT YOU WANTED YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL INSECURE BECAUSE YOU CAN GO BACK AND SAY, &quot;IF THAT WAS WHAT IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED, GOD'S GOT ANOTHER PLAN FOR ME, IS NOT TIED UP IN THE TITLE [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: I THINK ONE AS A RESULT OF OUR RELATIONSHIP SECURE IN WHO WE ARE IN HIM. DO YOU KNOW WHAT A NIGHTMARE AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IS AFFECTED BY HOW OTHER PEOPLE YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES ARE? THE BIBLE SAYS: NOW, I WANNA JUST ASK YOU HOW MANY OF YOU MAYBE WHERE YOU NEED TO DO SOME [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: OKAY, WE'RE GONNA TALK [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: AND WE'RE GONNA GET SO, ARE YOU THE KINDA PERSON GONNA COME OVER, [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: OH, THIS IS [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: &quot;OH, WE GOT ALL THE KIDS HAVE WE'RE THROWING EVERYTHING WE'RE SHOVING EVERYTHING WE'RE PICKING EVERYTHING UP. THE DISHES ARE THROWN [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: AND THE COMPANY LIKE, IMPRESSING THEM [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: BUT WE KNOW WHAT'S AND THE DOORS. OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? THE SAME THING CAN BE TRUE WHEN SOMEBODY COMES AND WE WANNA IMPRESS, OR HAVE WE INVITED GOD AND DO A LOT OF DEEP CLEANING HMM...YOU KNOW-- IF YOU WOULD BEHAVE AT HOME BEHAVE IF I SHOWED UP AT YOUR [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: C'MON, WAKE UP. I'M TIRED TOO. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: SEE, OUR BIG EXCUSE I JUST CAN'T HELP IT. I JUST LOSE MY TEMPER. I'M JUST AN EMOTIONAL PERSON. I JUST CAN'T HELP IT.&quot; [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: THAT'S ONE EXCUSE THE &quot;I CAN'T HELP IT&quot; EXCUSE. &quot;IT'S JUST HARD. IT'S JUST SO HARD.&quot; IT'S HARD FOR EVERYBODY. WE ALL JUST THINK BEING BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY SO, YOU KNOW, AND YELLING AT MY KIDS I MEAN, I WASN'T ABUSIVE TO THEM A LOT, YOU KNOW, ALL THE TIME. [GRUMBLING] WERE LIKE THAT BUT I WAS. I ALWAYS SAY, &quot;I GOT ALONG CAME HOME AND THEN [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: AND HONESTLY, AND IT TAUGHT ME A GREAT LESSON IN MY TEACHINGS ALONG THESE LINES. ONE DAY I WAS UPSET WITH MY KIDS AND, YOU KNOW, BACK THEN AND THEN THEY'D GET &quot;CLEAN THAT MESS UP.&quot; [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: SO PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE KIND OF LED BY THEIR A LOT OF THEIR UNHAPPINESS LIKE, &quot;I'M GONNA BE HAPPY NOW WELL, NOW I'M GONNA BE HAPPY AND SO, I WAS HAVING AND THE DOORBELL RANG AND IT WAS MY PASTOR. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: I TELL YOU WHAT, [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: I MEAN, &quot;OH, PASTOR! WOW, IT'S SO NICE OF YOU OH, THE KIDS? OH, YEAH, THEY'RE PLAYING. THEY'RE--&quot; [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: &quot;THE LITTLE DARLINGS, IN THEIR ROOM PLAYING.&quot; [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S AMAZING WHEN THERE'S WE WANNA IMPRESS [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: WELL, THAT WOULD IF THAT'S ALL I SAID. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: BUT I'M GONNA SAY 'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? UNTIL WE TAKE RESPONSIBILITY &quot;WELL, THAT'S JUST THE WAY I AM, YOU KNOW, WE'VE ALL GOT EXCUSES STUFFED WITH A LIE. THEY'RE NOT THE TRUTH OF GOD'S US A SPIRIT OF SELF-CONTROL TO GET IT DEVELOPED AND TO LEARN NO POINT IN ME OR YOU &quot;I JUST CAN'T HELP IT,&quot; US TO DO OR NOT TO DO SOMETHING THE ABILITY TO DO IT. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: WE CANNOT HAVE LEARN HOW TO LIVE DEEPER IN GOD. AND WHAT THAT MEANS BUT WE DON'T LIVE BY THEM. WE HAVE THOUGHTS; WE HAVE THINGS WE WANT BUT WE DON'T LIVE BY THEM. I THINK TOO MANY OF US, THE TIME TRYING TO FIND A WAY AND THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT IF I SAID TO YOU TODAY 'CAUSE I WOULD NEVER SAY THIS NEVER COME BACK IF I DID. SO, WE'LL JUST PRETEND THAT &quot;YOU KNOW, THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET 'EM, AS MUCH AND SERVE HIM ANYWAY?&quot; WE ALL NEED TO ASK OURSELVES: FOR WHAT HE CAN DO FOR ME? AM I JUST WILLING TO SERVE HIM IN MY LIFE? OR AM I WILLING TO SERVE HIM IS MAKING SENSE? AND I SEE OTHER PEOPLE AND I DON'T THINK THEY'RE AND SO I DON'T KNOW WHY GOD AND GIVING IT TO THEM.&quot; THAT HE'S AFTER. &quot;WHY ARE YOU GIVING THEY'RE NOT NEARLY I AM SO SPIRITUAL.&quot; [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: ALL RIGHT, &quot;SO THEN THOSE WHO ARE LIVING AND I LIKE THE AMPLIFIED BIBLE, IT FOR YEARS. &quot;THOSE WHO ARE LIVING THE LIFE TO THE APPETITES AND IMPULSES SO, HE'S SAYING THAT LIVING THAT WE CATER TO OUR FLESH.
