DESTIN: Hey, it's me, Destin. Welcome back to Today, we're going to hang out Air Force. We're going to see if we The temptation, when you're flying in an F-16, is to to make yourself look Do I need two chin straps But that's not this video, These pilots, however, But I learned, through that an F-16 is very Several years ago, I went at Randolph Air Force base trainer they use to train I learned a lot about on your cardiovascular in my life, I felt the 5 G's, in fact. When I got the itinerary and I started said things like, get oh, I haven't really done that. And then it's saying hydrate. And when you think you're This looks like it's but, you know, I've done the So it's got to be I got this. Man, was I wrong. Let's start with who They consist of 12 are highly experienced and 120 enlisted personnel fields. These are the crew and the technicians who make mission ready. Every member had handpicked in a highly Their mission is precision aerial maneuvers and of modern high performance of professional skill required They've done this with a and they're currently operating commonly known as the Viper. The FAA and the military highly over land due to sonic booms. My flight was scheduled to practice at Keesler Air Force Biloxi is right on and there's a stretch of and my home state supersonic flight is approved. I am finally going to get to is something I've been since I learned about the This is my pilot, Thunderbird Major Jason Markzon. Turns out Flack the same pilot up in the T-38, which made confident about what He explained to me was incredibly maneuverable, to is the limiting factor. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: do when we first get into air awareness exercise, or g-ex. So we'll accelerate and then we'll pull 4 to 5 G's. DESTIN: You're going MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Yeah. DESTIN: You probably know right now you and I are in 1 G. around us, right? If you're in a fighter jet, and you fly in an to feel like you're through the seat because of It's like when you're driving Everything slides same thing. So if you're in a 2 G is going to feel like If you're in a 7 G maneuver, going to feel like And I conceptually and I understand the math, is he actually wants to MAJOR JASON MARKZON: It's not so much a test are we ready to pull G's? DESTIN: Are you an adult, MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Make Can you breathe appropriately? Things like that. DESTIN: OK. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: hasn't changed probably DESTIN: So when we start, if I can hang or not. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Pretty close, yeah. DESTIN: OK, cool. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Yeah, I'll so I can give you feedback if And then when we do our next-- our actual G awareness G 180 degree turn that we'll do. DESTIN: Holy cow. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: So we'll DESTIN: 180? That's 6 to 7 G's for how long? MAJOR JASON MARKZON: So we'll sustain that about 20 seconds or so. DESTIN: What? OK. I'm going to level with you at this point in the game. We're sitting there talking going to happen, and I'm I can do this. I ran a half marathon. I can carry all the at this-- in one go, one trip And if worse comes to worse, and I'm just going and I'm just going to take it. I might black out, but I'm good. I understand the math. I'm good. But I knew that I needed to fake because I didn't want-- if something bad happened, I I told you you were So I was saying stuff MAJOR JASON MARKZON: We'll consecutively. And then we'll do our DESTIN: After the aileron rolls? MAJOR JASON MARKZON: before the aileron DESTIN: So this is MAJOR JASON MARKZON: This that's-- this is when the true DESTIN: So what happens is and then you're like, that I'm the fighter we're now going to MAJOR JASON MARKZON: It's just to show you the of being in the cockpit. DESTIN: After the time for Sergeants Jasper to suit me up. They measured me, made sure the mask fit be an issue, trained me and laced up my g-suit On the way out to I was kindly offered a pair I declined, and we And to be honest, this is You always walk to your MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Everybody else is moving fast, but DESTIN: That's fun. There was a lot of tradition and you feel really are planted firmly you have to put on the g-suit in If you don't know there's absolutely putting the g-suit on in Getting in the g-suit's Climbing up to the cockpit of MAN: Right foot, right here. DESTIN: Yes, sir. MAN: Take your left hand, DESTIN: You put my name on it? MAN: Oh, absolutely. DESTIN: That's impressive. MAN: Sit down. DESTIN: This is cool. MAN: Throw that helmet on. Look cool. DESTIN: Look cool. That's going to be hard. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: DESTIN: Yeah. Left, right, left, right. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: That's my guy. DESTIN: OK, here we go, the We're going to point He's going to kick on means putting fuel to get additional thrust. Hard bank right, shoot This is insane. It's what I imagine riding MAJOR JASON MARKZON: I am ready DESTIN: I am ready, sir. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Rocket up. Smoke on. Ready now. Smoke off. Ready now. And on the roll. Here comes the afterburner. There she is. Airborne. The air is coming up. Right turn. Departure. [INAUDIBLE] eight airborne [INAUDIBLE] that's Radar contact. Climb and maintain. 1-6,000-- 16,000. Getting ready to DESTIN: And you're operating That's a delight. What's your thrust MAJOR JASON MARKZON: DESTIN: Man. Look at you turning MAJOR JASON MARKZON: DESTIN: And just like So now that we're we should probably learn This is the heads up display, MAJOR JASON MARKZON: If you it says 351-- that's DESTIN: Yes. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: from that, kind of down the S-I-M. DESTIN: Yep. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: The number Mach number, so 0.70. And then below that to that's the current-- the max G that we pulled. And then on the is the current G DESTIN: So current G, 1.0. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Yep. DESTIN: 1.3, 1.4, got it. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Yep. 0.69 Mach is where we're at. DESTIN: Understood. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Cool. All right, you ready to do DESTIN: Yeah, let's do it. OK, here we go. The first maneuver is the G awareness exercise-- and when I feel the to clench everything up, make sure I'm getting And I'm also wearing is supposed to squeeze my Tell me when I need to MAJOR JASON MARKZON: I'll say, here comes the G's. And when I say G's, that's when So that's when I need you-- DESTIN: I need my head back? MAJOR JASON MARKZON: you don't need your but that's when you're going to strain. DESTIN: OK. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Cool. All right, man. DESTIN: We don't know if my We didn't dry run it. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: All right, here we go. Here come the G's. All right, that is it. DESTIN: 4.6? MAJOR JASON MARKZON: 4.6. DESTIN: OK. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Here we go. 180 degree turn coming up. Here come the G's. All right. Destin, how you feeling? You got 6.7 there. DESTIN: Good. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Nice, man. Yeah, that's impressive, dude. DESTIN: The first maneuver was already far more difficult maneuver we did made me realize this but it's going to be fine. It's going to be fine. Next, we went supersonic. We took the jet to means the fastest go without the afterburner, MAJOR JASON MARKZON: So you right now. DESTIN: Yeah. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: So as soon as I go afterburner, DESTIN: OK, so I'm OK. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: DESTIN: I do see that. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: DESTIN: Yeah. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Here we go. AB, here's the Mach, man. We just broke it. 1.02. DESTIN: Nothing happened. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: 1.04. 1.05. Well, so-- DESTIN: The MAJOR JASON MARKZON: that I can feel the DESTIN: Yeah. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: And watch Feel yourself slow DESTIN: Oh, wow. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Yeah. DESTIN: Hard. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: So-- DESTIN: And the-- and the MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Yeah, So that's just the-- I think that's the pressure DESTIN: Yeah, it's MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Yeah. DESTIN: Breaking in the cockpit of a is something I've dreamed about and it finally just happened. I was expecting a shake Nothing happened. Other than these I wouldn't have known But the reason the gauges Let's start with this. This is called a is how you measure how This is essentially the This is an old one but if you look there's a little bitty hole. As a jet flies through come to the Pitot probe, and And if you've got a pressure you can measure what's called Basically, it's how which is, of course, a function Another thing about is they have a second and that's on the side. If you see these called the static and they go to a tap right back here in the back. And if you take the and you plug it into you can calculate the So if you think two main things that Number one is the The more air that comes the higher the But on the static mainly affected by the At lower sea levels, you'll but as you go up have a lower static thinner at higher altitudes. When you start breaking though, weird stuff happens. For example, the says that an aircraft should pressures as it approaches destroy the airplane. This theory is known as the So this theoretical that the front of the aircraft Singularity-- turns which is great, because What we do see, however, is right as we approach Mach 1. And we can see that by You see how the seems to go down before punching through Mach 1? That's because the at the static port on the but once you punch the altimeter reading goes and this has a very When an object goes faster a shockwave is created. And to take a let's revisit a previous We fired a supersonic bullet to visualize the shockwave. The pressure on the is higher because the air but the pressure is what's called a it's at a lower pressure. So now compare the shape of If we have shockwave that means the to be behind that shockwave which means it's going That makes the gauges on the because a higher altitude is and that's why the you go supersonic in a jet. I always knew that was a and it feels really good the physics behind it. Another thing I is this is the rare opportunity firsthand that I've always and that's the fact is lower at higher altitudes. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: 0.99 Mach is about 390 and up. There we go. We just broke the Mach, touched the afterburner. DESTIN: Really? MAJOR JASON MARKZON: So this jet It's 390 knots, so it's a Less drag on the airplane. DESTIN: On the left, you can see that we broke Mach calibrated, but on the right, feet, we broke Mach 1 at an calibrated. Now, this is which is different And yes, we were going and winds, and stuff is the higher the altitude, required to break Mach 1. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: I think efficient at supersonic. It just depends DESTIN: What's the MAJOR JASON MARKZON: DESTIN: Wow. Yeah, I've lost the MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Oh, yeah? DESTIN: Yeah. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: DESTIN: If you're not trained Flack's just up there but I'm in the back suffering. It was incredible. Anyway, so back to maneuvers. We're going to do a split-S, down, 180 back the other way. So are you going to do MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Yeah, man. You ready? DESTIN: Yeah, I am not-- I am not excited about the 9 G. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: OK. DESTIN: I will G-LOC. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Yeah, DESTIN: GoPro. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: going to do a split-S DESTIN: Right now MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Yeah. DESTIN: All right. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: All DESTIN: OK, let's pause it and play. This right here is the precise Somehow, the beginning of that and the eggs began to scramble. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: DESTIN: That's awful. I am awake, but barely. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: DESTIN: I am doing bad. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: DESTIN: Well, that was-- that was amazing, and I That was my limit. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Oh, yeah? DESTIN: I stayed awake. What was it? MAJOR JASON MARKZON: DESTIN: At 7.2 G's, like it weighed over 70 pounds. My vision came down and I no longer had I was getting worried about the is why I was happy when with a knife edge maneuver. You're kicking my tail. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: All Here comes the knife edge. Smoke on ready now. And a little left bank. A little bit of rudder, and a So you-- at this altitude, to hold on. We'll try and put a little Yep. so at this altitude, to maintain its altitude? But at a lower altitude as fast as we're going, it'll DESTIN: I'm going I don't even remember I was just hanging but looking back at the is pretty interesting. If you think about they have a lift vector out of the wings, keeping But if you're turned like doesn't really help you. So what you have to use the body of and the rudder, which is why better down at lower because the density of and you can get much more Oh! When I edit this, I will tell everyone MAJOR JASON MARKZON: My iPad in that knife edge [INAUDIBLE]. DESTIN: Did it really? MAJOR JASON MARKZON: You want DESTIN: Yeah, let's do it. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: OK, this but it's a lot of fun. All right, smoke's on go for eight-points. Don't stop. One, two, three, four, DESTIN: We did it. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: We flying if you'd like. DESTIN: Sure. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Smoke on ready now. You're just going to DESTIN: Whoa! MAJOR JASON MARKZON: We're inverted. Here comes a little DESTIN: OK, my body MAJOR JASON MARKZON: roll back out real slowly. DESTIN: OK, I am tapping out. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: We'll cruise back to Gulfport. How about that? DESTIN: Yeah. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Cool, man. DESTIN: And that was it. I tapped out, and I did not My plan was to get do whatever, and just take it. But in the moment, that split-S and I couldn't recover. My vision started coming in. Stuff was spinning. I started hitting limits and it humbled me. That kind of humility it's different. I have to live with the fact to do a 9 G maneuver in That's a hard thing. To learn more about let's take a look at these. These are the 3D versions on the inside of your body. This is the gyro I'm not even really but to learn how these work, to NASA's neutral to a physiology expert She's got a really shows us how these things work. SHARON: So what I put your hands like this. DESTIN: OK. SHARON: You can put It's probably easier. DESTIN: OK. SHARON: Now, when I turn I want you to tell us DESTIN: OK. SHARON: When I turn you in DESTIN: OK. SHARON: If I stop you-- because DESTIN: OK. SHARON: All I want DESTIN: OK. Close my eyes? SHARON: Close your I'm just going to take DESTIN: OK. SHARON: I'm going DESTIN: OK, all right. So I think I'm going OK, I'm gone. I can't tell what SHARON: OK, open your eyes. DESTIN: Am I moving? SHARON: Nope. Your eyeballs sure are. DESTIN: Are you serious? SHARON: I'm very serious. DESTIN: Can you look My eyeballs are-- OK, SHARON: No, but they sure were. DESTIN: Can you do SHARON: Sure thing. DESTIN: OK. Wow. SHARON: That's OK, are you ready? DESTIN: Yeah. SHARON: I'm going to Stop. Open your eyes. DESTIN: That is messed up. I got sweaty. SHARON: I'll bet you did. DESTIN: Wow, OK. SHARON: Wow, indeed. DESTIN: That's what happens. SHARON: Yes. DESTIN: So it's my ear that Force Thunderbirds jet. SHARON: Yes. This is what happens. You remember those I was talking to you about? DESTIN: Yeah. SHARON: There's stuff This stuff hasn't DESTIN: Yeah. SHARON: But if I move the stays where it is because Well, if you had some when I move it could imagine those hair back and forth, back and forth. DESTIN: Got it. SHARON: That's why, when you can feel that motion. Now, watch what happens Pretty soon the fluid catches DESTIN: Got it. SHARON: In other words, When I stop it, the So it's bending your hair cells So what you're relying on is are telling you. Now, what happened to you, whoa, all of a sudden the fluid starting to move It's called a Coriolis effect. It feels like you're tumbling at once, and it's miserable. DESTIN: Thank you. SHARON: It's very miserable. DESTIN: Thank you SHARON: Yeah. DESTIN: It explains that's why I tapped out SHARON: Yeah, it's not pleasant. DESTIN: So when my head had a different axis of Couple that with a maneuver spinning one way and I just couldn't handle it. WOMAN: I'm sorry, MAN: [INAUDIBLE] standby DESTIN: Flack flew and I started feeling In fact, after exactly three Man, now I'm back. By that time, though, for air show practice, out of the airspace We did, however, get to do We flew over to was a super special because granddaddy used to take The Battle of Mobile Bay supposedly said those and full speed ahead, cool to fly through The return to base was a little because I knew there were that we didn't do. It's the upside down MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Yeah, DESTIN: Even as we were guessing my decision to tap MAN: All right, [INAUDIBLE]. DESTIN: He kicked my butt. I told you earlier that is the human pilot inside. For example, the control What you're seeing a quarter of an inch of but that is a 6 G and that was enough With that in mind, I'd to one of the most impressive Her name is Major Michelle She's who the Air to do some of the most by the Thunderbirds, I felt some of these hard to overstate how What strikes me while talking she is. Just listening to her talk, what she's doing clearly of human capability, But what really strikes me about she is. This is Thunderbird 6. This is Mace. Mace, I don't know exactly So there's eight birds? MAJOR MICHELLE CURRAN: in the demonstration. So we kind of refer to is 1 through 4, and then and then I am the opposing solo. So we come together, all We call that the delta but the first part see four jets together in three loops, and rolls, and And then you have 5 and I, max performing the aircraft. I'll pull 9 G's. I'll do vertical from 200 feet over the ground a few seconds. So we're kind of the shock and what the F-16 can do. DESTIN: I just flew, and I did And I'm told you do MAJOR MICHELLE an acquired tolerance, right? DESTIN: Is it, really? MAJOR MICHELLE CURRAN: I think Like, it's OK. But from 7 to 9, it's but we train for that, right? We fly for four months over the getting used to pulling G's. We'll fly twice a day, so you If I haven't flown it's a little bit harder G's than when I'm We wear the g-suit, Squeezes the life back into you. DESTIN: Yeah, but still My brain just quit you're not only. You're talking on the radio, and maneuvers, and all of that. MAJOR MICHELLE have parameters I have to hit. Not talking on the radio under the air is being crushed out and we have specific exchanging that air to keep the G's. But I am flying 200 feet over and then when I and I go into my is where you pull up and over going uphill for that, so. DESTIN: You're doing 9 G's MAJOR MICHELLE CURRAN: Mhm. DESTIN: Are you serious? MAJOR MICHELLE CURRAN: Yes. DESTIN: So what is the Because-- MAJOR MICHELLE CURRAN: DESTIN: Is it, really? So how are you feathering that? MAJOR MICHELLE CURRAN: marker in our heads And so you really just put and as long as I'm and I get a solid pull, without a lot of DESTIN: That sounds like but that's super human stuff. That is-- MAJOR MICHELLE CURRAN: DESTIN: It's like That's amazing. Thank you so much. MAJOR MICHELLE CURRAN: DESTIN: Yeah, 9 G's. That is impressive. MAJOR MICHELLE CURRAN: 7.5. DESTIN: Whatever. 7.2. I couldn't do 7.5. MAJOR MICHELLE DESTIN: Thank you. MAJOR MICHELLE CURRAN: DESTIN: I don't caught what Mace said there. She's pulling 9 G's, and she's 200 foot off the deck. If you're going hundreds it takes no time at There is no margin This is what I learned Thunderbirds. Sometimes in life I and I'm probably not the but maybe I'm overconfident learned in a book, or experience I've already had or maybe even because Here's where I'm at If I don't approach with an appropriate and humility, I'm going to be So moving forward, whether or a discussion going to try to maintain that and humility, so I don't which can happen, sometimes on the internet. Teaching people how to maintain and humility-- that's If you talk to any they'll say there's We constantly have to practicing to to operate an aircraft safely. But there's another thing the They take people they can do incredible things, That was amazing. If you are interested I will leave links down This was an opportunity So big thanks to Thanks to all the ground crew for Flack for taking me up. It was amazing. So check that out. Links down in the Go check them out. Thanks. Bye. You'll notice there's no so big thanks to all at Patreon.com/SmarterEveryDay. I hope this video earned If not, that's no big deal. I'm Destin. You're getting Have a good one. Bye. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: I can let you fly DESTIN: Yeah. MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Cool. All right, man, you DESTIN: There's no MAJOR JASON MARKZON: Yea. Aileron rolls, left You can pull some DESTIN: OK. I'm going to do a roll. MAJOR JASON MARKZON:
