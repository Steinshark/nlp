Across blank scar The gray wolf moon Echoes through Into your empty room It slips under your skin To the back of your eyes Is he frightened and lonely Like a motherless child There's an absence of faith There's an absence of trust A love that comes your way Is never quite enough You're stuck at Where it all blows wild Leaves you scared and empty Like a motherless child Her crown of jewels Her crown of thorns Sometimes you wish Sometimes you Sometimes you wish that you Could just wake up and fly There's nothing worse Than a motherless child Her crown of jewels Her crown of thorns Sometimes you wish Sometimes you wish Sometimes you wish that you Could just wake up and fly There's nothing worse Than a motherless child (gentle Parisian music)
