[Ja] And then was upset that [Jo] &quot;What's the issue?&quot; [S] &quot;Why are you guys replying so much?&quot; - [Ja] Yeah. &quot;What gives?&quot; [Ja] The funniest thing to me is [Ja] Like, I just in a that you don't know why people are mad. [Ja] But it's more [S] Yeah, it's the intentional ambiguity, and then everyone can be like, &quot;Actually, or &quot;Actually, she's actually like this, and my racist thoughts are validated.&quot; [S] There's so many ways and only one way for - [S] Which is, like, not watching it. - [Jo] No way.

It was so fast.&quot; [Jo] What a weird thing to lean into. - [Jo] It's not paying off. [S] People kinda charted this properly. [S] Like, she dropped the N-word; [S] People thought it was based. [S] And now she's gonna [S] But then she said something-- [S] Apparently, she and then everyone started [S] And also, maybe a man. [S] They turned on her [Jo] You have to be consistent. [Jo] That's the only [Jo] If you're a Scientologist, [N] If someone was saying I was a racist, and I was saying the N-word, and it I'm like, &quot;Yup, I'm that - [S] Yeah. &quot;You know what?&quot; - [Jo] &quot;I'm gonna go.&quot; [N] &quot;I'm gonna sign off. [Jo] &quot;What was I even saying? [S] Yeah, they hit her for that. [S] I think they also were [S] Like, every part of &quot;Actually, you're not one of us. [Ja] &quot;You didn't pass [Jo] Gatekeeping is alive and well, [S] But she couldn't get out of it, so now her life is [Jo] It's the one person in who is not a successful bully, but I am a piece of shit. [Ja] Oh, that's what [Ja] Where she's like, - [S] Mr. Krabs' daughter? [Ja] I can't even remember - [Jo] JustPearlyThings.

Or people who [Jo] The party we met at, there was-- [Jo] A previous party at the same place, I'd just worn a shirt that said [Jo] And our friend Oxi later told me, months later, &quot;Yeah, no, she thinks you're from Texas.&quot; [Jo] But still thinks this is my accent. [Ja] I did hear someone really, like, kinda disagree with me, - on whether or not you were American. [Ja] And I'm like, &quot;I don't [N] If you had to be American, - [Jo] Oh... dude. [Jo] Well, I'm a patriot, so... - [N] That's covered. [Jo] I'd be an Army brat. - [N] Oh, OK! [Jo] A farmy brat. [Ja] I did meet a British guy didn't have a British accent, [Ja] He was like, &quot;No, I'm actually and I have lived there my entire life.&quot; [N] But he lived on a base.

You go to the doctor, [Ja] It pans to Aiden. [Ja] &quot;Can you get rid of him?&quot; [Jo] I like him, dude. - [N] He's just the best. [Ja] What a sweetheart. [Jo] I'm not even close to knowing [Ja] How much time do you guys [Ja] Like, for us, [N] It varies depending on-- [N] We never hang out all four of us. - [N] That is very rare. [N] Yeah, we used to all the time. - [Jo] You OK? [N] Because we used to live together. - [S] We used to live together. [S] What?

Call of Duty: Modern [N] And we've been getting together so Ludwig comes to that. - [Ja] Right, nice. - [N] For the love of the fucking game. [Ja] But that's important. [Ja] You gotta have some stuff - [Jo] Yeah, come on. that the second we start streaming it, [N] Everyone's gonna be looking at [Ja] Yeah, you just can't-- [Ja] I'm so not in the know. [Ja] What was the situation where, like... [Ja] Did Ludwig really get hacked, - [S] No. - [S] That was Penis Star League. Ludwig was streaming every day. [N] And it was 11:00 p.m. [N] He decided to come to [N] And he was like, &quot;Fuck, I gotta start [N] I was like, [N] And so I set him up and he streamed one game. [N] Everyone who's playing in PSL is using their actual old Xbox accounts. [N] So everyone's on their [N] And one of our [N] Everyone's logging in like, [N] His was Jewish Rayquaza. [Ja] I saw that. I tapped into the stream, like, &quot;What is going on here?&quot; [N] So Ludwig was on that account, so he logs on from Jewish Rayquaza, and everyone in chat - [N] Like, &quot;He's clearly hacked.&quot; I was like, &quot;This doesn't seem like would somebody be hacked and then streaming Modern Warfare '09? [N] It's like a crypto code - [N] Elon Musk's face. [Ja] Unless it was prerecorded video, [S] Dude, his subreddit, &quot;Can someone track down Jewish Rayquaza? - Can they figure out who's doing this?&quot; - (all laughing) We were just dying at the Reddit [S] It was like 5k viewers, so it was like this bomb of a stream - that made no sense and scared people. - [S] It's like, &quot;Fuck yeah, brother.&quot; [S] And it was gone, yeah. [Ja] There's someone, by the way, who that was the last stream - [Ja] They just fell out. [Ja] And they're like, &quot;I didn't know - [S] &quot;Why are they playing the old one?&quot; [Jo] How much of the Pokedex he found one that was available? - [S] Rayquaza's a legendary, right?

(laughs) [Jo] How did you vow that you were gonna the pool closes, your bike you try riding, it falls off, falls then put a roast chicken in, forget it, it - [Ja] Oh, yeah.

[Ja] I had so much funny, like, almost cringe nostalgia. [Ja] It felt like I was looking at [S] Yeah. When F127U [Ja] Just Socially Awkward Penguin [Jo] I did not realize how [Jo] Like, I was out of the [Ja] Oh, by the way, - I still recommend checking it out. - [Ja] Really? - [Jo] Maybe a poster. [Ja] I'm like, &quot;This is insane.&quot; [Ja] It's 12 years old now, you could say that they &quot;Wow, these people are talented.&quot; [Jo] It's better than [N] You can see where their [N] It's like VFX, like, &quot;Wow, that's maxed-up stats.&quot; [S] Community came out in '09, and that's still pretty fresh, [S] I don't think it's aged amazingly, but put that up against VGHS, - which was what, 2011? [Ja] But VGHS was in its pocket of, like, &quot;for a community.&quot; You know? [N] I think a lot of times those guys-- [N] Freddie Wong was an [N] He got me into motion and VFX. - [S] He got you into motion? [Jo] He taught me how to [Ja] I was stationary before that.&quot; [Jo] I used to watch his videos, [N] And kissing. Um... [N] Those guys, I feel like &quot;What if we did a high school and the VFX would be like this?&quot; and they go, &quot;We have to write it.&quot; but I've always felt that in their stuff. [Ja] But still, [Ja] I was like, &quot;OK, the person writing [N] Have you guys seen The Guild? - [Ja] I know of it. [N] That one's similar. [S] I haven't watched it, 'cause we were working on a show, - called &quot;the boss fight,&quot; where-- - [N] The last episode of season one. - standing in the same room together-- [S] The Guild. And one of them, [N] The whole story the first season is that one of them runs away from 'cause he's in love with her [Jo] Is it in canon, like-- [Jo] Is it like Jumanji, like - [S] No, it's all plausible. - [Jo] It's cool. in a World of Warcraft-like game. [N] And one of them's and they meet in real life to try and his mom shows up [N] And they're like, - [S] Yeah, dude. [S] She gets mad and someone else [N] &quot;Oh, no, she's gonna epic pwn us!&quot; - [Ja] Oh, there's a lot of that in VGHS. [Jo] I feel like my... [Jo] Now I just don't [Jo] It stresses me out. If I look at [Jo] But at the time... [Jo] Sometimes you look back &quot;How did anyone let this happen? [Ja] &quot;I should've been [S] It's all a cycle. and then they were cringe, [S] Wearing JNCOs again, but without [Ja] Yeah. I think that-- [Ja] Oh, what I was gonna the editing is so tight that... it doesn't even have the effect-- [Ja] Like, there's cringey jokes for sure, but it's cringey in a fun whereas if you watch one of those made-for-Tubi movies [S] Those shits are crazy. - [S] It's crazy. I was like, &quot;Wow.&quot; Even though watching with modern standards, this is cut together well even though I'm not on [N] It's the difference between vs. a Tubi movie, which is like, &quot;OK, they're lobbing it up. That's the most obvious thing Oh, they said it. Now we're sitting [Jo] And it's a Steven Seagal movie [Jo] It's him walking in and doing his blaccent [Jo] Like, &quot;You ain't never gon' do - [Ja] There is a line like that. [Ja] There's an AAVE-style-- [Ja] I'll say &quot;style,&quot; because it in one of the first three where the main character, who's not Black, [Ja] I can't remember, but it's and my eyes were screaming. [Ja] It was funny watching - goofy slapsticky character. [Ja] 'Cause in real life, he's so chill. [Ja] Also, it's been 12 years, - [S] How old are you guys? - [Ja] Dude. I can't even... - [Jo] Damn. [Ja] That's crazy, dude. [S] I know! I have my walker and shit. - [Ja] I'm 32. - [S] No way! [S] And you're dirty for me. [N] My turn? 28. [Ja] OK. I thought [N] That's why I can hear the CRT. [S] We're all in the same, like... [S] I don't know. with disgust or with nostalgia is a question between [Jo] I know that at the time it was fresh, and there was no cringe and that is now what gets in the way. [Jo] But every now and then, somehow a Socially Awkward - [S] OK. [Jo] I can't find the [Jo] I just can't--where is he? [Ja] Do you remember that the happy dance while - [S] For Starbucks. - [S] She's really good at that. - [N] Almost exclusively. - [N] Yeah. - [BOTH] Yes. - what a fucking pivot. [Ja] I only saw it on Twitter, and people were only cringing at it. - file it away. - [N] It's pretty funny. - [N] Sorry. [S] She made, like, synthetic diamonds &quot;Yeah, this isn't... this isn't real.&quot; [Ja] I was like, &quot;Wow, this is potent.&quot; [Jo] If a cop touches one of [S] He dies, and [S] As he stares up [Ja] Law &amp; Order detectives [Jo] Brother, don't even-- - [S] So, this is your thing. [S] My uncle... - [S] He's dead now. [S] I thought he was a good guy. [S] Uh, but he lived with and he would just watch it nonstop. [S] It's very nostalgic. - [S] I'm a kid again. [Ja] Do, do, do the cop! [S] (laughs) I've never heard the lyrics. [S] I've only heard [S] Do you wanna talk [S] And the crimes [Jo] The show is very bad, - [S] How ethics? - [Ja] It's just copaganda. where they... [Jo] Instead of doing, &quot;Actually, it's instead what they do is a lot of but there's six that that they need to be let to be police. [Jo] Almost every single episode [Jo] You don't notice, &quot;I got that evidence this morning.&quot; What?! [S] And it's some grave, &quot;Yeah. Here it is. Midler just [Jo] Half the episodes &quot;Oh, we should check the evidence.&quot; [Jo] &quot;Oh, check the CCTV, [S] Have you seen the Community [Ja] Yes. I love Community. [S] They literally have, like, the audio compression - [Jo] I have not seen it since I saw-- [Ja] One of Community's after Community we had a very big, &quot;OK, we get it. The show [Ja] But I was in high school. [Ja] You too, probably. [S] I was out of high school. - [S] But that's very sweet of you. 'cause it started airing in 2009. - [Ja] So you were only just out. [N] I watched it near a high school. - [Ja] OK. [Jo] I was learning to smoke cigarettes. [Ja] But yeah, dude, [Jo] I do think there's, like... [Jo] Cringe is almost the antibodies of an era in your life, I feel like, 'cause a lot of what I'm [JO] It's the version of me that liked it. [S] I guess it is yourself, 'cause you can look back at and it doesn't feel that way. Yeah. [S] It really is centered on how we... - [Jo] You are laughing at it only. [Ja] Like, you have to have [N] I've reached a like cringe Facebook jokes, where I've come back around - [Ja] That's me with Hawk Tuah Girl. who hasn't come around, I can laugh at it with them. [Ja] Sorry to interrupt your but we have brand-new merch. [Ja] It's got a sweet graphic on the back. - [Ja] We've also got it available in-- [Ja] That color, which is... tan? - [Jo] Cream? [Ja] &quot;We love you [Ja] We've got shirts. We've got [Ja] We've got the - [Jo] A very tasteful-looking... [Jo] In a kinda sky blue. [Ja] Just letting you know they're real, at SadBoyz.store. [Ja] I had an idea for a video that I... like, fell out of 'cause it just-- [Ja] Maybe I'll pick it back up one day. [Ja] I wanted to join Facebook groups of people posting boomer memes and try to make memes [Jo] Oh, high-performance post? [Ja] Basically, I wanted to - in a boomer meme Facebook group. [Ja] Right. [Jo] One of those accounts [Ja] For example, one of the - [S] &quot;Dave and Amanda.&quot; deep-fried Minion memes, [Ja] There's no joke or, uh... [N] It says, like, [S] Are you talking [Ja] Not even ironic. [S] Like, &quot;Don't talk to me [Ja] Yes. It would be those. [Ja] It's too good of a graphic design. - [Jo] OK, yeah. [Ja] But it would just get [Ja] All these groups, [Ja] There's some three-year-old video, a screen recording of me requesting to join all of where you have to fill out-- [Ja] I don't know if you've - [Ja] They have an application, and you have to [Ja] Like, who you are and what - [Jo] A resume. - [N] It's like that, yeah. and then I got approved so I was starting to study the blade of what type of memes were popular. [Jo] They must be [Ja] Maybe that's the [Ja] Except for the AI stuff... [Ja] I would have to find the stuff because now the AI memes are like, it's Donald Trump with a gun on a cat. - [Jo] Yeah. - [N] He posts that picture a lot. [N] Yeah. I'd go in those groups that feel and look like but don't actually mean [Jo] Yeah, what you need is but cheese is coming out or &quot;These kids are always eating cheese.&quot; [Ja] Yeah, &quot;This [S] There's a slop AI [S] So, there are AI accounts - [S] It'll be like a Black child, but-- [S] And then the size of a bus, with like eight tits underneath it, and people are eating the milk, and it'll be like, &quot;One like for sadness.&quot; [S] And boomers are like, &quot;Yes.&quot; [N] Rodrigo from [S] &quot;So sad.&quot; It's crazy. [Ja] When you said you sound like those people on the or in Ohio who are talking [S] &quot;This is happening, and it's [N] You know what's worse? [N] Than the Facebook boomer, people who aren't funny thing, is the... the &quot;shirts that go hard&quot;-core person, who is wearing a shirt that says - [Ja] OK, honestly... - [Ja] You kinda came out guns blazing. (all laughing) [S] &quot;Three glasses, please.&quot; - [Ja] Yeah, give a bad example. [Jo] Why can't we miss, ever? [N] I don't know. I hate that shit. - [S] I know what you're saying. [Ja] Well, the focus of that video wasn't it was gonna be about the humanity of it. [Ja] In the harmless case, there's nothing wrong with this. [Ja] And people are and I wanna find a Kinda &quot;kill the part of you [Jo] Do they isolate that group to reduce the people coming in [Ja] Yeah, they isolate it - [N] Also, bots. [N] Bots are worse at - [Jo] They're not as funny as us. - [S] They don't get it like we do. [Ja] If you made that onto a shirt, you made it yourself and it would unfortunately-- [Jo] It's a picture of the [S] Ohhhh! - [N] Damn. - (Jordan laughs) [Jo] Jackie Chan confused meme. [S] Dude, I said this the other day. where every sub was a millennial callback. [S] It was exactly what we're [S] Uh, it was... [S] But one of the things it [S] OK, so if you don't know, there was a thing on Reddit that, if you wanted to identify you would say a phrase. [Jo] I did not know that. - [S] It's gonna hurt to say. [S] The phrase was, - [Jo] Is that what that's from?! [S] And then the answer is, - [Ja] That sounds familiar. unmotivated random bullshit. [S] Well, it was. It was! [S] But at the time, it was thought [S] I did this. [S] I did this in real life to - [Ja] Wow. - [Jo] Problem solved. [N] Did you narwhal [Jo] You're pulling your collar [Jo] You're like, &quot;This is epic.&quot; [N] &quot;I think I'm gonna like her.&quot; [Ja] &quot;Uh, methinks [Jo] &quot;I could get used to this.&quot; [S] So, look, when this shit... [S] Like, I lived this shit, man. - [Jo] &quot;Born to kill, brother.&quot; [S] I got the hat with the [Jo] &quot;We did what we had to.&quot; [S] We had to! [Jo] is it happening right now? [Jo] The line has appeared? [S] Well, you say that as &quot;we.&quot; [S] Like, I'm 34, and I feel like terrarium for a while now. [S] I think almost every single [S] Every scene I've been into, 'cause I play video games, right? and I do content. Like, [S] You know what Northernlion's [Ja] He's doing content, though. [S] But he's also bald and has [Ja] I don't understand [S] But you know what I'm--? [N] Let's just say in a he'd be a janitor [S] A principal with bad intentions. [Ja] I think that a lot [Ja] 'Cause now I feel more in it than I was when I was [Ja] 'Cause when I was [Ja] I just didn't have time. [Ja] And now I have nothing so I think I'm a [Jo] Being in tech felt a little bit like you're forced to be in one of those [Jo] Like, depending on who's &quot;Have you seen this?&quot; - [S] Dude. - [Jo] &quot;Or we could just do the meeting.&quot; - [Ja] It's like, &quot;OK.&quot; [S] A friend of ours works in tech. [S] I don't know if you one of the guys in the he'll say shit like &quot;by Odin's beard.&quot; - (Jordan laughs) &quot;That's fucking funny, man. Anyway...&quot; - [Jo] &quot;I love lamp, by the way.&quot; [Ja] You know what movie - [N] Yeah, that's a good movie. [Ja] I watched it [Ja] There's a new movie... [Ja] It's not called &quot;Zodiac.&quot; - [Jo] Is it a horror movie? and it features the actor that played the - [Ja] I don't know his name. - [Jo] No offense. [Ja] The Asian best friend. - [Ja] Batalon. [Ja] Yeah, so this movie, all of the exposition in it was like, &quot;Heh, we're all just best friends, and we just started college, and we're back for some sort of break.&quot; [Jo] &quot;This is such a younger brother [Ja] &quot;Aw, man, we rented this [Ja] Like, that was the way that [Ja] And then I was like, [Ja] And you watch 40-Year-Old Virgin, This is a tight screenplay.&quot; [Jo] Even the way it's marketed, I remember that movie being like, like wacky-twisted-silly.&quot; [Jo] And it is quite... I don't know; there's like an aching sincerity to every [S] I would argue that the is described in the title, - which helps a lot. [S] You really are given all the tools [Ja] But I think if you around a campfire in the you don't need to explain [Jo] What is the... do they do tarot, and then the king of spades or [Ja] If memory serves, because they're the age where [Ja] But then they open a door and then they go into to try to find alcohol they can steal. [Ja] And they find an - [N] It probably says &quot;don't open.&quot; &quot;Remember from before? - [Jo] &quot;Evil tarot cards.&quot; [Ja] Yeah. &quot;Don't split up. [Ja] And then there's a mystery of, like, &quot;Where did these tarot cards come from? It's killing all of our friends.&quot; [Jo] &quot;This sucks. - [S] So it was a shit movie, you think. - [Ja] But also yes. [Ja] I think that there's a hard line. [S] I don't think - [N] I agree. and there is a nuance to that, or it's actually good. [Ja] I think that's what I mean. [Ja] There is, which I am pointing at. [S] He's pointing to his giant shelf of [N] I think he thinks [Ja] There's a poster of The Beekeeper. [Ja] The Beekeeper is that, watching it, I couldn't [Ja] But when we and he is a person who shitty action movies, basically, and he was exactly the audience for it. [Ja] For him, it was perfect. and it had a really high rating. [Ja] So there's bee puns all over. [Ja] The guy, he's like a... extra-governmental entity... [Jo] He's kind of like a [Ja] Outside of the CIA, and he keeps everybody in check. [Ja] And he's also really and he's not really a beekeeper [Jo] And he is doing an American accent, but he's British, and they [Ja] The movie also including the White House and but it was all shot in London. [Jo] Jeremy Irons is in it, - [N] It sounds awesome. - [Jo] It's one of the best movies ever. - [Ja] So it's camp. - [Jo] It is compelling, I guess. - [S] Or you did like it? [Ja] It kind of had a [S] The thing with camp, [S] Do I consent to watching while pretending it's not, [S] And then if the answer is no, then you're just watching [S] But it requires that consent of you to be like, &quot;Yeah, OK, they're being...&quot; [Jo] &quot;Am I locked in?&quot; - [Jo] Like, &quot;This is great if--&quot; [S] &quot;I'm gonna hear (chaotic sounds).&quot; [Ja] And you have to be and I'll spoil a small part of the easiest way to give you the vibe [Ja] There's a point in who, by the way, one of the new bad guys who just shows up in [Jo] It feels like an adaptation of [Ja] Yeah, there's a character with a - &quot;Why have we not seen him before?&quot; [Ja] And, uh... [Ja] And he has got the and he says, &quot;To be or not to be.&quot; [N] Oh, beast. [N] I can't resist. If I'm in that spot, I'm ripping something similar. - [Jo] I'm riffing. &quot;I've gotta choose... to be.&quot; [Ja] And then he presses, like, a detonator on a bomb. It explodes. [Ja] He gets out of the situation, [N] Is he protecting - [Jo] You know, he fails to. - [Ja] In a way, he's avenging a woman. - [S] Dude. [S] When I was a kid-- [S] It's funny, 'cause I was more of-- [S] I think I was 17. [S] My mom rented a movie called, uh... [S] What's the one where Jason Statham - or he dies? [S] Crank. She rented Crank. [S] There's a scene in [S] He needs to get his heart rate up, - so they start banging in the street. - [Ja] That works?! [S] No. I think it's in Crank 1. [S] I don't wanna talk about Crank 2. - [S] I'm trying to talk about Crank 1. - [N] Someone say Crank Tuah? [Jo] (laughing) OK. [Ja] The difference (all laughing) - [S] So, she rents this, and-- - and they're in like a parking lot. because my mom watched it, and I was like, &quot;I wanna watch that movie when you're [S] She was like, - [Jo] At 17. &quot;You're not watching that movie.&quot; - [Jo] &quot;It's too crank for you.&quot; I think at 15 or 16. [Ja] 'Cause I thought it was a biographical story about [Jo] How he met all those puppets. [Ja] Yeah, how he met all [Ja] Um, but then-- [N] Yeah, and his [Jo] It's one of the weirdest [Ja] No, but there's a sex scene in that, and it was like the only &quot;accidentally watching a sex [S] Yup. RIP Brittany Murphy. [S] She was a big crush - [Jo] Did she die? [Jo] I thought you [S] Well... like everything. [S] She was in this movie, [Ja] I thought it was [S] No, it's really good. [S] It's got Mickey Rourke in it. [S] It's the best - [Ja] Yeah, she's a great actress. [S] I don't even-- [Jo] He at no point [Jo] That seems like the - [S] Jason Schwartzman? [Jo] He's like, &quot;I gotta - [S] &quot;This is gonna kill me. I'm 5'5&quot;.&quot; [Jo] &quot;Goodness gracious, I'm very tired.&quot; [Ja] I always felt like Jason Schwartzman and Demetri Martin were [Jo] Yeah. Same aisle at the store. [N] I was such a big Demetri Martin [N] But that does not age. [N] I feel like his sense of [Ja] Yeah, it's interesting. [Jo] It was nice, 'cause - [N] Yeah. [Ja] I used to listen to back when there were really comedy albums. [Ja] Now it's Netflix - [S] You were a Vicious Circle guy. - [S] Of course you did, dude. [Ja] What was it called? But before - [Ja] Anyway... [S] &quot;Twat!&quot; [Jo] He just keeps saying that. [Ja] Yeah, Dane Cook was very much a very funny style of energy comic, where all of it was energy [Jo] It's funny to [Ja] Well, it actually made sense for him, - [Jo] Oh. They're-- [Ja] It's literally that! Literally, [Ja] It's like, &quot;OK.&quot; [N] I need everyone to - [N] He's got some bangers in there. [S] His Comedy Central Presents - or something? It's really good. [S] &quot;BK Lounge.&quot; &quot;I put a cashew on the - [Ja] I remember that. [Jo] I mean, even just early inspirations, and you now [Jo] Like, I was such a Gervais guy. - [S] Really?! [S] &quot;Do you believe in God?&quot; - [Jo] &quot;Well, I don't, you muppets!&quot; [S] &quot;A man in the sky? [Jo] Then I go back and &quot;There's stuff in here. [Jo] And now his material is, [Ja] I mean, that's how I feel - [Jo] Yeah, it's a bummer. [Ja] There was material, &quot;I'm just gonna make - that's also hate speech.&quot; - [Jo] Just do comedy. I don't know. and this sounds maybe self-aggrandizing, I always just picked winners. - [Jo] Wow. [S] All the shit I liked, - [Ja] I agree, more or less. [S] Chappelle Show-Chappelle - and it's like, &quot;Come on, dude.&quot; are amazing sitcoms. [S] Here's the thing: [Ja] Oh, dude. My biggest pain with The Office is I watched it, and it was like, &quot;You won't [Ja] I was like 14, going into can you guys believe Dwight?&quot; [S] It's a big deal. [Jo] I was very anti-US Office. [Jo] What helped me Ricky Gervais's, [Jo] I went, &quot;OK, [Jo] &quot;I don't owe him any loyalty.&quot; [N] I don't fuck with [Jo] Relax. [N] (Britishly) &quot;They've put - [S] &quot;Oh, bother.&quot; [Jo] &quot;Ohhh... me job!&quot; [N] &quot;Me job is gone!&quot; [Jo] &quot;Oh, me bloody--&quot; [S] &quot;You think there's [N] I still like how all the [Jo] He is so... there's a... a movie adaptation, basically, like his character, he made a movie that's [Jo] It's all about &quot;David Brent [Jo] And all the jokes... feel shockingly un-self-aware, also just wants that. [Jo] Like, he wants to be as a talent, as a musician, [Jo] And all the jokes are like, &quot;Dude, imagine you were un-self-aware and trying too hard at [S] Couldn't be me. - [Ja] I'll say this nostalgia-- [Ja] I'll claim this even [Ja] I think the difference between is that Steve Carell is - [Jo] Oh, yeah. In the right role. [Ja] I stand by his dramatic roles, his [S] He's pretty good. - [S] I can't really think of one. - [S] Never saw it. one of those old-school, [Ja] And I think I just have [S] You have respect for improv? [S] You have respect for [S] You have respect for people - [Ja] Who find a way... who can do improv and then - [S] Yeah, that's the ticket. - [N] Without the use of Patreon. - [S] Hard mode. [Jo] The begging required. [Jo] You guys doing a DCOM show, right? - [N] Yeah, we have a DCOM show. or is it the first time watching them? [N] I watched a lot of them. [N] We have a lot of moments, 'cause we've been doing [Jo] You went chronologically? - [S] No. [N] We've done where we picked based on [N] After doing this for--you know, [N] It's not as fun anymore, [N] And around year, let's say, we started picking movies like, 'cause this'll be nostalgic or fun.&quot; [N] But now there's only - so it's all musicals. [N] It's every musical [Ja] Have you seen the - [S] We did 1 and 2. - technically not a DCOM? - [Ja] That one was released in theaters. [Jo] Oh, Disney Channel [N] But we haven't done 3. [N] The biggest fans of the DCOM show and they're like, &quot;Do the good ones!&quot; It's - [Ja] Yeah, that's real. [S] We'll probably have to do it today. that's pretty recent, actually. [S] And it's like they're like Beauty and the Beast and shit. [S] Anyway, they're two hours long. - [Jo] YA novel vibe, right? [S] It's like trash YA - [Jo] Yeah. [Ja] We... I have made a like years and years ago, mostly. [Ja] And so we kinda wanted - [S] There's some fun older ones. [S] Oh, please. [N] Yeah, Smart House is a movie &quot;Wow. I loved that movie. It was so fun and cool and new, and something I hadn't really [N] As an adult, poopy stinker butt stinker.&quot; - [Ja] I love it. [S] And not because it's cringe [Ja] You hate LeVar Burton - because he directed it. [Ja] I mean, I think my main criticism-- [S] Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's Black?! [Ja] No one's motivations - make any sense in the movie, and it's very funny. because it has the right opinion about technology. [S] Is that it's gonna [Ja] (laughing) Yeah. If left unchecked. - [Jo] Yeah. it's like, &quot;We're giving one [Ja] &quot;You've got a Cybertruck - [Ja] And, uh... [S] Yeah, I guess that makes sense, 'cause the plot of Smart House is that the kids don't like the and then she decides '50s, '60s, I Love Lucy-type television. - [S] And it gets weird. - [S] She's very beautiful. [S] The voice of Leela, right. - [Ja] Katey... Segal? Sagal? - [Ja] What is it? [Ja] OK. That's actually a - [Jo] Can you pull that up for me? - as they were coming out. [Ja] Is Stuck in the Suburbs - [S] Yeah. [S] We just watched that one. [Jo] &quot;A teenager's life is disrupted [Jo] That'll do it. That would [N] The scene I have to tell to get them into it is this and looks in the sink. and there's a bubble in the sink, [N] And she learns that because - [N] That's the plot of the movie. - [S] It's pretty nuts. [S] My vote for best DCOM - again, a technology one. [S] He ends up having a robot [S] Not to spoil it too much, but he basically goes into his own and solves a problem in a [Jo] Did you guys - [Jo] I don't think it was a DCOM. a holographic movie cover, where the left side is a happy snowman, and the right side is a angry snowman. [Jo] Am I mixing up--no, - [Jo] This is with Keaton. [S] I got really scared at the other one. [Ja] I remember the trailer for this. [Jo] It rules. I have such [Jo] 'Cause you know the tradition of, [Jo] &quot;And I learned something [Jo] There is no moral lesson - [Jo] Because he's a snowman. - [S] Oh, they gave him boobs! [Jo] Oh, he's like Olaf. - [S] Olaf is a child. [Jo] The CGI is great, to the prosthetic version of it, and the way they've characterized - [N] Is that Michael Keaton? - [N] Holy shit. [Jo] He died. He has to come back [Ja] Paul F. Tompkins is on there [S] Does... what does he learn at the end? [S] Does he come back to life, [Jo] He's just dead, dude! [Jo] Which I think is the traditional, but he writes something [N] I was watching... I just saw [N] I was looking at the credits, - [S] What?! [Ja] That's like when the kid from - [Jo] Oh, really?! [N] People were like, - [S] So was Josh Peck. Oh, that's who. [S] Dude, Josh Peck showed up in [Ja] Wait, look at the actor who was in-- [Ja] Just Google - [Jo] &quot;This is gonna blow up, I bet.&quot; - [Jo] Devon Bos--ohhh. Whoa. Jeez. [S] Yeah, that's a smoldering pic. - [S] He's smoldering. [Ja] If you look at his it's like Diary of a Wimpy Kid, - [Jo] And Saw. Badass. [Jo] Was he a kid that got [S] You know, every year - [Ja] All of them?! - [Ja] How many are there? - [S] You would fuck with that? Yeah? - [S] We can watch Saw. It's coming up. - [S] We can have a Sawathon. [N] There are only two chairs. [Ja] Sounds like I'm gonna - [Jo] Oh, fuckin'... - [Jo] Shoot you to death. [S] No, it's fucked up. I would watch and then I'd just get really - [Ja] Like in a really convoluted way? [S] It's just you're [Jo] &quot;Dude, I got really sad, thinking [S] (laughs) Yeah. Yeah. - [Jo] &quot;Put me in such a mood.&quot; - in a big bed, and... [Jo] If Jigsaw tried to get me in [Jo] I'd pick up his puppet and smash it. [N] Is Scary Movie 1 funny right now? [N] I haven't seen it in a bit. [S] 3 is probably kind of still OK. [Jo] I have a lot of affection for those. - [S] Yeah. [S] Uh, Airplane and shit? - [Ja] I have never seen Airplane. [Jo] It's like watching 30 Rock, - [S] Yeah, it is! - [S] &quot;These are some thespians.&quot; [Ja] I can't remember but going back to the improv thing, there's one of these shows which is like a improv form. - [S] Are you an improv guy?! - [S] You got the SpongeBob Converse! - [S] I didn't know this! [S] I wouldn't have come over if I knew [Ja] The Upright Citizens Brigade - [S] Oh my God, bro. - [Ja] They make you buy this. [Ja] No, I think I bought it &quot;Well, I need to learn from the best.&quot; [S] Yeah, nerds will study a [S] Some of us also do that. [N] Saying &quot;yes, and&quot; to marry my wife. [S] I will say my value system-- is really fucked up, because it [N] And skin color. It's a thing [S] Yeah, I'm working on that. - [S] No, humor, I disproportionately-- [S] Higher than everything, right? [S] So if someone's funny, a lot of leeway, and... Either way, - when I met Jordan at a party... - [S] I went back to the-- - &quot;I met a guy today.&quot; [N] Never brought up Jarvis, like, ever. - [Ja] I get it. - [Jo] That was when we met, right? [Jo] Where someone [S] Yeah, the same one. - [S] I was just like, &quot;Dude, he's so--&quot; - [S] I know! [S] I don't drink anymore, [Ja] I do that too, and I like it. - [Ja] It's nice. - [Ja] Yeah. - [S] Fuck 'em all. [Ja] I think the problem is and then it's like, &quot;You just got here,&quot; [S] Yeah. That's why go to Denny's alone and - [Ja] Ooh, OK. - [N] He does this every Christmas. [S] Usually most of it. [S] I've done this for four Christmases. [N] &quot;I'm watching Denny's on my phone.&quot; [S] At The Matrix. [Ja] The Matrix 4 came out - [S] Yeah. I watch the first one. [S] I watch the first one every time. [Jo] I have a little movie night for you. - [S] Yeah? for a whole summer when back to back, first: What Women Want. - [S] No fucking way. [Jo] Hadn't seen the first. [S] They're essentially, if you [Jo] They are the exact same. - [S] So, have you seen What Women Want? - [Jo] It's one of the best films ever. through some sort of to read women's minds. [Jo] He's part of a marketing agency 'cause he's like a [Jo] He's Master Chief of [Ja] And he didn't just - [Jo] He did it to employees. [Jo] He is in the bath, trying on 'cause &quot;I gotta get in [S] Yeah, and then he falls in the bathtub and electrocutes himself - [Jo] Which gives him-- - [Jo] And he gets psychic powers. - [Jo] Chemical X. and he's working on a campaign for Nike. [S] And he comes up which is &quot;Nike: No games. Just sports. [S] Which is pretty beast. [S] Anyway, at the end, he ends up in another electrical accident and he's trying to court Helen Hunt, who is the other-- the lady who was on the [Jo] And she was a new hire who's He's always saying [S] &quot;He's always talking [Jo] A decently pre-Mel Gibson [S] Oh, so far before - [Ja] Like early '90s? [S] Call it '01. [S] Anyway, great fucking movie. [S] Watching that movie as &quot;Women do have thoughts. [N] And they be shopping, man. [S] It's all the same shit in their head. [Jo] But for this movie, it's written like there was a pitch, almost like improv. [Jo] Somebody was like, &quot;OK, movie by reading women's thoughts.&quot; [Jo] But it's written by the idea of liking women, so the whole movie is him correctly assuming they're [Jo] He's walking around; [Ja] Yeah. I do feel like say to a lucky woman one day, - [Jo] Ohhh. - [S] &quot;What?&quot; Not kidding. - [S] I'm not kidding. [Ja] So, when you said [S] No. I said it twice, and then I explained what it was. - [N] Oh my God. [S] It was... I mean, I don't know. [S] I was charming. [Ja] So you, like, mansplained Reddit.com? [S] By the way, in this movie, [S] She is a barista. He hooks up [S] Then, while they're having [S] She's thinking about [S] I remember this movie [S] And then he starts fucks her right. She becomes smitten, and then he doesn't [S] She comes and approaches [S] &quot;Ahh, you can't just give me the and then just--&quot; This is [S] And then she comes up and in a panic, he says, &quot;I'm gay.&quot; - [S] And that is how, in 2001-- - [S] (laughing) Yeah. [Jo] Like Snake's parachute. (all laughing) [N] Nowadays, that - [S] Tell me about it, bro. [S] &quot;I'm woke,&quot; and [S] The end of the movie is but on the way it's raining and he's [S] He loses his ability. [Jo] Don't forget about when maybe wise, silent Asian - [S] Does he think she has no thoughts? - [S] I don't remember this. [Jo] Maybe it's from an old version in an antique Chinatown [S] It's like a sacred vase - [Jo] After midnight. and he realizes he can't but he realizes that what he's learned, he will always be able [S] And he is now a - [N] Without asking her? - [N] That's cool. So he's still magic. [N] It's crazy that it where he first gets and then the writers' room was like, &quot;We Oh, we'll hit him with lightning.&quot; - [S] Yep. he'd get hit by lightning, - [Jo] Because God is a woman. [Ja] Right, 'cause it would with such a rare event, because it's very unlikely that because that's very unlikely to happen [Jo] And he wants to get rid of it, [Ja] His life up to but he's struck by lightning [S] I think there is a point in the and I think he actually [Jo] He has his Groundhog - emotional tolerance. [S] What's funny is I watched and my dad had HBO. [S] So it'd be like that movie, - [Jo] (laughing) Hell yeah. [S] I'm just mainlining, you know, beautiful Hollywood slop. [Ja] I have heard those names of movies, [S] You'd love BASEketball. [Jo] You've got those clamps on [S] And then when I got bored, - [S] It was just media. - [S] Ocarina of Time. [S] That was my... [Jo] Were you like 30 - [S] (Porky Pig sounds) [S] My heart-print boxers are showing. [Ja] So, most of our information one of our white editors. - (Jordan &amp; Slime laugh) [Jo] You wanna guess where they're from? [Ja] You get this. You guys see, probably, your offspring in the wild. Like - &quot;That's a Yard fan.&quot; - [N] Vans with flames on them. - (Slime laughs) - [N] Oh my God. - [Ja] He did this. [Ja] He did that on purpose. [Ja] I was like, - [Jo] You don't like these? - [N] God. [Jo] Can we put an X over Aiden? [Ja] Yeah, we'll work on that in post. [Jo] You don't like [S] That one is a bad picture of me. [S] I don't think [Ja] &quot;3-hour YouTube war documentaries.&quot; - [S] I do. I'm in my history era. - [S] Yeah. Real shit. [S] So, what he's missing here, and I think what is a bigger controversy of what I've uttered is the concept of women fucking dogs. - [Ja] What? [Ja] Maybe 'cause why would [N] Don't get me started on - [Ja] OK. [S] Yeah, this all makes sense. [S] Do you want me to explain these? [Ja] This is my [Ja] So I'm with you. [Ja] What are your thoughts, [Ja] Or do you mean &quot;taking care&quot; of dogs? [S] No. No. Actually, no. [N] Going over our own bits, - [S] Ohhhh! No, they're cool. [N] They're really sweet. [Ja] Yeah, they're nice. [Ja] I fucked up Riley's name, because I was so focused on remembering Graydon's name. [N] Oh my God. [Ja] Literally, I was like, &quot;Graydon and-- Fuck, I used all of my brainpower [Jo] You don't name - [N] No. (laughs) [N] What's his middle name? - [S] Yeah, it's crazy. - [Jo] It's Baldur. [S] Like, I think nine dogs is [S] 'Cause the nine dogs - [Ja] Nooo. [S] So many people have posted that this is like verifiably kind of true. [Jo] This is an indictment - [Ja] &quot;Take care of?&quot; [S] They take care of each other. - and play with each other. involves a lot more - [Jo] For some amount of time. - [Ja] That it's easier to--? it just surviving, so being there - [Ja] No. [Ja] No, no, no. we have bred dogs to rely on people.

[N] It's like, &quot;Oh, what's up? Cool. [N] I could not beat up [Jo] &quot;I'm not gonna say [N] But I haven't seen this guy in years. [N] One of the guys he's playing - [Ja] Whooooa! - &quot;I would beat you up if I ever saw you.&quot; [N] And so the next day, I'm like, [Jo] That's good, 'cause [Ja] How'd you find out [Ja] The PE class guy?
