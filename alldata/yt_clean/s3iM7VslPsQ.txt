I'm dressing all white and clean today Let us tell you something dirty. On the evening of August 15, 2023, more than 400 Singapore police officers raided nine of Singapore's top high-end residences at the same time. This was a large scale arrest operation after several years of covert investigation. One of the panicked suspects was still trying to escape he jumped directly from the balcony on the second floor of his home. His wrists and ankles were all sprained, while limping he hid in the sewer. In the end, he was found. Ten suspects were arrested Luxury cars, artworks, cryptocurrency assets luxury watches, luxury bags, cash, etc. Assets with a total value of more than $1 billion were seized. Actually, there were a total of 27 suspects but in this operation only 10 were arrested and the remaining 17 suspects are still at large in Singapore. Later, it was found that the total stolen money exceeded $3 billion. This huge amount of stolen money mainly came from an illegal online gambling platform based in Southeast Asia. Some also came from some illegal loaning business including online fraud, etc. In the end, the flaws were exposed during money laundering in Singapore. This is the Singapore money laundering case that shocked the world. It is undoubtedly the largest money laundering case in Singapore's history. We have learned about the specifics of this case and how the money was laundered We'll talk about it in a while Our video today is much more than that. I want to expand on a topic that I personally think is more interesting and much more ambitious. According to a very rough estimation by the United Nations, the scale of global money laundering will reach 2% of GDP every year to 5%. Note that it is 2% to 5% of the global GDP which is probably more than $2 trillion Around us there may seem to be a lot of ordinary economic activities in all walks of life Art, luxury goods, real estate transaction, corporate investment and financing even ordinary deposits and transfers may be hiding money laundering activities. Let me tell you, for this video, I have watched hundreds of money laundering methods and hundreds of classic cases. At the beginning, I thought it was a bit messy I couldn't figure it out, but slowly I found out that I understood it Let's cut to the chase and get to what money laundering is all about. Note, let me first emphasize that money laundering is definitely illegal. You can't launder money. You can't launder money. You can't launder money. This video is just for your knowledge mainly to let everyone better understand money laundering and better prevent money laundering, and better understand the rules of how the world operates. In order not to make it a teaching video, I will not go into many specific operating techniques In simple terms, money laundering is the process of legalising the stolen money obtained by criminals through a series of techniques so that it can be spent openly and openly. This is also the process of laundering the dirty money. Someone may come up and ask You can just spend the stolen money directly Why do you need to launder it? If you defrauded 3k to 5k or even 30k to 50k you can indeed spend it directly. This is no big problem But if you have 3 to 5 million, 30 to 50 million or even 3-5 hundred million stolen money? This is like for example, there is a student, let's call him the Baddie One day, he accidentally picked up a wallet in school. When he opened it, there were 10k In the world of primary school students, it is considered a big deal. Baddie came up with an evil idea. He wanted to keep this huge sum of money for himself. But if you think about it, if he took the money to buy a new iPhone and returned home, the regulatory agency, which would be his mother would ask a lot if questions So what's the ideal situation? Baddie wanted to spend the money openly under his mother's eyes, he needs to explain to his mother in a very rational way where the money came from Here, money laundering is needed. So now can you understand a little bit? When the amount of stolen money becomes huge, money laundering is very necessary. As a criminal who has obtained a huge amount of stolen money He needs to solve two problems. One is that he needs to try his best to make this money becomes difficult to trace Wipe the footprints clean. The person he defrauded will definitely report to the police, so he has to find a way to make it difficult for the police to follow the money and trace it to his account. This is the first The second is to rationalising the money because even if the police may not be able to trace to the bank account, But as an ordinary clerk, who earned 2k-3k a month suddenly went and bought a yacht This is definitely not possible, isn't it? It 's unreasonable So money laundering is to solve these two things at the same time, eliminate traces and rationalize income We will see various money laundering techniques in a while. Its ultimate purpose is to solve these two things Let's start with some classic and simple methods. We need to know that in the early days, most criminals, such as drug lords, actually had their dirty money in the form of cash So the most classic method of money laundering was to take advantage of industries with a large amount of cash transactions, such as opening a restaurant or a laundromat or if you want to go bigger, you can open a casino or a gold shop, because these industries themselves will have a large amount of legal cash coming in and out every day. Then it is actually very easy to mix this dirty money in. For example, if your laundry actually makes 10,000 yuan a day, and you mix in 5000 it is reasonable if it becomes 15,000 It is actually very difficult for regulatory agencies to count how many customers you have every day or check your invoices one by one. The 5000 will be laundred away without anyone noticing. So you see, it actually solves the two problems of eliminating traces and rationalising income In the 1920s, There is indeed a mafia boss in the United States who opened a laundromat to launder money this way. That's how the word &quot;Money Laundering&quot; comes from. You see it is very vivid, right? Opening a laundromat and laundering money It is a pun. The word has been passed down like this, so in the early days, many mafia bosses or drug lords would have their own legal businesses. If you launder dirty money directly, it may be easy to get exposed It would be much easier and more concealed to mix clean money together. This method also has its limitations. First of all, you have to have a physical business, right? For example, if you have a restaurant and there are not many customers in the restaurant then how can you rationalise it by saying that I can earn 100,000 a day, so it depends very much on the business volume of this entity. The efficiency of money laundering is very difficult to achieve. It is also impossible for drug loard to work very hard to run his laundromat every day right? At that point he might not sell any drugs and became an entrepreneur with his laundromat It will be quite funny So later on, as the amount of criminal money laundering increased, supervision became more and more intense. This method can only be used as one of the entrances to the entire money laundering chain. In order to isolate risks, these criminals generally do not hold it themselves. They may hold it on behalf of others or set up some shell companies. There is also a method of using cash transactions method It is also very classic called casino money laundering. Instead of opening your own casino you go to the casino because the casino is actually a place where it is very easy to explain the inexplicable sources of income. It is easy to rationalise the stolen money and most casinos can accept a lot of cash, they will take the money to the casino and exchange it for chips. Then they can play for a token amount of time It doesn't matter if they win or lose. Then they can convert the chips into money or checks Then the money is laundered. Later, if someone asked you where the money came from You can say that yesterday I went to play blackjack and was lucky enough to make three million. In fact, this method of money laundering in casinos was still quite popular However, as far as I know large casinos have become more and more formalised in the past 20 or 30 years. The act of taking cash directly to the casino is becoming more and more strict which is equivalent to taking cash directly to the bank so now it is becoming less and less Most of them are relatively small amounts of money laundering Next, let's talk about several money laundering techniques which actually use the conversion between different forms of assets to greatly increase the difficulty for regulatory agencies to track the money. The first one is to rely on art to launder money. If you look at auction of art generally, there will be privacy protection for both parties and can be done very well. At the same time, many can accept cash, which is very suitable for money laundering. And as for the value of the art it may be worth 10,000 or 100 million. It can fluctuate greatly, so a lot of money laundering is hidden in large-scale art auctions. The Mexican government introduced an &quot;Anti-Money Laundering Law&quot; in 2012, which strictly limited the amount of cash used in art transactions. As a result, once this law was implemented, The art trading market that was booming in Mexico was cut. Many works of those rising artists are no longer valuable Is this a reasonable speculation that the art market is a channel for money laundering Of course, this does not mean that all art related transactions are all about money laundering. It's just that there is indeed a possibility that dirty money is hidden there. We have to be more rigorous. However, spending such a huge sum of money to buy art and put it at home or use it to appreciate is not the way how the game works Some criminals may not be interested in art. What is the common method? I buy it at a low price, for example, 100,000 Then I go to an expert, who will appraise the painting for me This painting is good it's worth 10 million. Then I sold the $100,000 painting to a shell company of my own for 10 million. Seems reasonable so I successfully laundered 9.9 million turned into a legitimate income from art investment Maybe I can also get title of Master of Art Appreciation Many people will use art to pay bribes Generally, if you want to pay a bribe, you don't just give people cash it's not easy to spend But if you give a piece of art it is both eloquent and difficult to detect. It can also be very secretive if you want to cash it in later. As far as I know, bribery through art and money laundering are quite common in Brazil. It can also have some variants of gameplay. For example, if a criminal wants to bribe Lao Wang, Lao Wang can take out a painting of his daughter and put it up for auction in this auction house. Then the criminal registers a company and take a look and say this is a master-level painting, the reincarnation of Leonardo da Vinci This is postmodern art 10 million it was all done in one step, both money laundering and bribery. The price we mentioned was just to give an example so that everyone can understand easily The actual case may not be so extreme In addition to art, there is another asset that almost all money laundering and all criminals are involved in, which is real estate. Therefore, real estate is not as volatile as the price of art, but criminals generally really like it They can enjoy it, invest in it, and launder money. Not everyone can appreciate artwork but who doesn't like mansion In many cases, this property is a terminal for criminals to launder money. For example, the Singapore money laundering case mentioned at the beginning involved as many as 207 properties in Singapore alone. This may be just the tip of the iceberg of their global money laundering. According to incomplete statistics two of them posses properties worth $3 million in Dubai. Real estate can also play different roles in the process of money laundering For example, the most direct one is that it can consume your cash. In some countries, it accept buying a house with a large bundle of cash and will not conduct an investigation on your income and identity. For example, just like the Dubai case What else can real estate do? It can be used as a proof of the source of your wealth For example, if you use the stolen money from a shell company to buy a house, and then you sell the house then the money obtained from selling the house becomes part of legal income When you deposit the money in the bank and people ask you where does the money come from I got it from selling my house. It's legal and reasonable. Most banks will not continue to ask how you got the money to buy the house. They won't ask you that. In short, these money launderers love real estate very much. You see, such a large amount of money laundering goes through real estate, and these money launderers actually does not care about the absolute value of the property, it may not have that big an impact on him. They are most willing to increase the price unscrupulously to buy it. So let me tell you, this is actually an important reason for raising housing prices in places like Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, London, and New York We mentioned about art and real estate There is another very common method of asset conversion, which is gold laundering. What are the advantages of gold? It is easy to transport, easy to carry and has better liquidity than art and real estate. It is very easy to buy and sell. Let me give you a practical example. let's take a look at a Moroccan money laundering gang. How he helped British drug traffickers launder money. First of all, in the UK, the drug lord would put hundreds of thousands of cash in the trunk of the car. Usually he would find a public place, such as Starbucks and meet the money laundering contact person A. they will look at each other and exchange code Once matched the drug dealer will secretly give the car key to the contact person A A will drive the car filled with stolen money and start his money laundering journey. A, who is an airport cleaner on the surface, has an inconspicuous role. He will physically bring the money from the UK to Paris and give it to contact person B an ambulance driver B will give the money to his brother C, C is responsible for counting the money at home. He would count all the money and then pack it into bundles of 10,000 each. The entire process is done in extremely careful way, closing the doors and windows the whole time and would also turn on the TV very loud to cover up the sound of counting money. After that, B will go and get the money that has been counted into bundles and give it to the two middlemen D and E D and E are two middle-aged women who will drive the money to Belgium found a black market gold merchant F who converted the money into gold and also had some forged receipts This way, carrying gold would not be as ostentatious as carrying large amount of cash. Even if the customs finds out, you still have receipts, it will not be so suspicious, right? Then D and E will fly from Belgium to Amsterdam and then from Amsterdam to Dubai with the gold We mentioned before that Dubai is the city of gold. They will convert the gold into clean cash in Dubai The cash is taken to the bank, deposited in batches, and transferred to anonymous accounts of shell companies around the world. Look at this whole thing. The whole process is very complicated, very secretive and very professional. This gang has been using this method for several years. and laundered $250 million As to why there are so many steos selling and buying, exchanging, moving I am not clear either Most probably to avoid some regulations in these countries But we know the underlying logic, which is to use the physical transportation of cash using the isolation of national borders and use the conversion of assets between cash and gold to eliminate traces and create difficulties for supervision. So how did such secretive method discovered? It is true that the longer the chain, the more potential loopholes there are. At that time, an Ernst &amp; Young auditor was checking the accounts of a jewelry giant called Kaloti in Dubai. He discovered how this company is spending so much cash to buy gold each year more than three tons of gold. How come there are so many customers who need cash instead of transferring money After reporting to police, the police followed the clues and uncovered the entire money laundering chain in 2017. 25 people were arrested from a gang of 27 people but the two bosses of this gang have not been caught yet. You see, we just said that I can launder money in the form of converting money into art, into real estate, and gold. Actually, there are many forms, such as luxury goods, diamonds and even topup card NFT has become very popular in recent years. We can also call it an asset form of art in the metaverse. Every time it is converted, the difficulty of investigation will increase exponentially. The criminal must be looking for someone who can remain anonymous. Leaves as few traces as possible He even has to hide from the camera to participate in the conversion between asset forms. Next, let's talk about how you can rationalise the income Just like Baddie in the beginning he wanted to rationalise the 10,000 he can tell his mother that this is my income from tutoring my classmates. This is a rationalisation method. The ways to rationalise income can are varied and is even personalised Because in theory, any investment you make anonymously, for example, if you use stolen money to buy a consulting company a trading company, a restaurant, etc. then the money earned by these entities is clean money. But investing for the purpose of money laundering, they are very eager for quick success and quick benefits. They don't want to make the business bigger and stronger. They just want to launder the money Therefore, economic activities for the purpose of money laundering generally have very obvious characteristics that is not aiming for profit The goal is to maximise cash flow as much as possible. For example, you can use film and television companies to launder money, because making movies and TV series, the money involved is very detailed and complicated It is very suitable for disguising For example a criminal may invest in movie making in the name of company A and then asked his company B to build a scene and blow it up. When you blow it up the cost may be just 1 million but I can say that the total cost of this project was 5 million It's all blown up so there's no way to prove. The 4 million is then laundered Of course explosion may indeed be a relatively extreme form, but during the entire filming process, you can make false invoices for any part of it You can fake it, right? Or you can make a movie and then when it is released, you can book the entire theater and make the box office so high. Then the box office revenue is equivalent to laundering money. This is for film and television company. For example, you can also launder money through a football team. For example, there is a Russian businessman named Tolstikov. In 2014, he acquired a Portuguese club called Leiria that was in financial crisis. Then this football team became a very important part of the Russian mafia money laundering network. They will launder money through player transfers, TV broadcast rights transactions or betting. As a result, in 2016, the Portuguese police launched the so-called Russian Doll Operation. The name is quite interesting, and they raided the football team arrested three members of the Russian mafia do you know how the Portuguese police suspected this football team? Actually from money laundering perspective they are very cautious but someone found that a football club that is about to go bankrupt and its owner living such an extremely luxurious life and then spend so much money on buying and selling players and most importantly the football players don't play This is too strange. Hence, the Russian doll operation, There is a more common way called Trade based money laundering. It even has its own abbreviation, TBML Why is it common? First, the volume of trade can be very large and the amount of your funds can be very large. At the same time, it is actually very difficult for customs to check the goods one by one. At the same time, it also has the advantage of allowing funds to flow across borders. The method is actually not complicated For example, you can do over-invoicing For example, if I ask a foreign country to send me a ton of wood its value may be only 10,000 but I can say that this is good quality wood I bought it at 10 million The customs don't know whether the wood is good or bad, If they say it's 10 million then it's 10 million In this way, it's very reasonable for me to transfer the 10 million Or you can go the other way and under-invoicing For example, if I import a batch of high-quality wood, which its actual worth 10 million but the invoice is worth 10,000 and then selling the wood for example, for 10 million, then the 10 million becomes legal income. Of course, as we just mentioned, the opponent you are trading with in this example must also be your criminal partner. Moreover, the number in the example we gave is quite extreme. It definitely cannot be 10,000 and 10 million In reality, for example, you can issue invoice of 1 million for 500k This is more realistic Many countries do not have cross-border capital controls so there are many money laundering techniques specifically targeting cross-border transactions. One trick is quite insidious called mirror trading. From 2011 to 2015, A Russian broker his name is Volkov. He will often contact the trading department of Deutsche Bank to help him buy a Russian blue-chip stock with rubles from his Russian company's account. It doesn't matter what the stock is, but he will buy about $10 million worth of stocks At the same time Volkov will ask trader to sell the same number of stocks in an overseas account registered in the Virgin Islands and sell it into US dollars or Euros, because these two transactions are carried out at the same time, so the price is almost the same. You see, for Volkov, the domestic stock purchases and overseas stock sales actually offset it, but what is spent domestically was rubles and sold overseas for US dollars Deutsche Bank made a profit in the middle. This transaction lasted for four years. By the time it was discovered in 2015, more than $10 billion had been transferred. Volkov's brokerage company became an underground Russian money transfer agency, helping many wealthy Russian or the oligarch transferred its assets overseas. Later, Deutsche Bank was also fined miserably. British Financial Supervisory Authority fined it for PS163 million US Department of Financial Services fined it another $425 million This method to put it bluntly it is converting fund into certain assets and then selling them overseas It is equivalent to completing a cross-border currency exchange without being subject to various regulatory restrictions. In fact, you can use not only stocks. Xinhuanet has previously reported that there are some criminals will use game currency or game point cards to carry out similar money laundering operations to avoid China's RMB exchange controls. The cumulative amount of money laundering is nearly Y= 40 billion. We have just talked about so many money laundering techniques to rationalise income and asset isolation Actually I deliberately hide a most common and can be said to be the core of contemporary money laundering techniques The use of shell companies to launder money. What is a shell company? Simply put, it is a company with no actual business. Generally, these criminals will remain anonymous in tax havens, such as Virgin Islands, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Panama and so on, registered many companies and then went to banks to open a large number of anonymous accounts in the name of these shell companies It is very easy to register company in these places. Just spend 2-3 minutes clicking on the internet and it doesn't require any personal information. The person in charge of the company can just hire one locally because there are agents to help you with this matter and basically it won't trace back to you Opening a bank account may be a little troublesome. You have to find an agent or set up a trust company and let the trustee help you open an account . In short, the establishment of this shell company and the opening of a bank account are very easy and do not require any personal information Criminals will use the shell companies registered all over the world and these bank accounts to become the basis of their asset network. Also can be said to be one of their money laundering network Most of their economic activities are basically based on these companies and accounts as key nodes. For example, let's look at a Mexican gang in the 1990s. He used shell companies to launder money. First, I deposited a large amount of stolen cash in Luxembourg as fixed deposit in the name of an overseas shell company A Then use this certificate of deposit as a guarantee to go to Paris for a loan in the name of a Gibraltar company B. This adds another layer. Finally, company D transfers the money to the name of a Panamanian shell company C Isn't this confusing If the regulatory agency wants to investigate this drug trafficker, it must first find out what shell companies it has in Panama. Panama has a bank secrecy law, and then you still have to go through the Paris customs. Even if you check carefully enough to find the mortgage, you still have to pass through Luxembourg It will be very difficult to recover the stolen money after several move in this network. Even if you can recover it, there may not be much left. Speaking of this, I think many of you may have questions since there are so many criminals are using these shell companies to hide information and conduct some illegal operations. So why do these shell companies exist Can't I ban them? Because this shell company is actually very useful in legal operations. For example, in terms of the company's management structure, For example a few people join forces to control a company then I can set up a shell company to hold the company Or in terms of tax planning, I can set up different shell companies in different countries for cross-holding. We actually talked about tax avoidance in tax haven video In short, shell companies are indispensable to contemporary business. Although these criminals are using shell companies to exert some control But the problem is not on the mechanism of the shell company For example these criminals are also transferring money between accounts. You can't ban all transfers right? The problem still lies in the supervision of shell companies in some countries and regions, especially I would say that the regulation of those tax havens and islands is indeed very inadequate. In the name of protecting privacy, they have hindered anti-money laundering investigations and attracted a large amount of funds and business from various overseas countries. However, after 2017, they were also forced to follow anti-money laundering regulations such as those of the United States and the European Union. Little by little they strengthened their anti-money laundering supervision. But generally speaking, if you push him, he will move forward half a step reluctantly. That's how it is Did you notice that in this step, its main features is that it takes advantage of the differences in regulatory rules between countries. If you want to put all these shell companies in one country, it is very easy for the government to get hold of them. But once it involves transnational borders, things change. In fact, if these regulatory authorities want to investigate, they can dig in. However, the layer-by-layer investigation involves very large labor costs and time launderers and regulators are essentially a cat-and-mouse game Mouse wants to run faster than cat run further and add layers of buff As far as I know, a very common way to stack buffs in China is that criminals will first establish multiple bank accounts in China Although these accounts In theory need real-name authentication but he can steal information. Even the person whose identity has been stolen may not know that these accounts are actually opened in his name. So sometimes, for example, you may receive something in your mailbox asking you to confirm the account opening It may be that your identity information has been stolen. Once the stolen money is received by these fraudsters, for example, an old man in Beijing was defrauded of Y= 300,000 over the phone and transferred out. The money will be moved around in these bank accounts that are not under his name This is layering. First buy some time and then transfer it overseas. For example, a bank account in Panama It will be difficult to get it back once there's overseas layer Even if the old man calls the police immediately, let's be more practical with it Would you ask policemen to call Panama government Can you help me check this 300k/? Not possible This is why terrorist group, drug lord or some big corrupt criminals would alert all countries to jointly investigate. if you read this incident in a textbook, it will tell you that there are three steps to laundering money. First, open the refrigerator door. No, no, First is called Placement which is to let the money enter the financial system. Then Layering, which is to let the money be transferred multiple times. It is very difficult to trace it like this. The third step is Integration and legally transfer the money to your own account or spend it Why I didn't introduce this to you in detail because when I was researching, I found that those actual cases are very difficult to correspond to each of these and to be honest, these words sound quite obscure. If I kept telling you that this is placement, this is placement and layering, and this is integration and layering, I would probably make you dizzy. So these 3 steps is just on need to know basis I think it's better to understand the two underlying principles I just summarized: elimination of traces and rationalisation of income The round-trip transfer between shell companies we just mentioned is actually a very good way to eliminate traces also corresponds to the second step of layering in the three-step method we just mentioned. This kind of layered money laundering through financial transfer actually has other variants In addition to stealing your identity or log in secretly these criminals can trick you to assisting him in laundering money without your knowledge. This will make it more difficult for regulatory agencies to investigate. For example, what would a money launderer think if you were an ordinary good person The criminal would try to dip this money into your bank account You transfer it to him and after some time he transfer it back to you This makes you a layered point in the money laundering process. Of course not everyone is stuoid Who would want to do anything with money laundering Therefore, money launderers usually package it into a topup form. For example, if you want to topup, you have to transfer him the money first either for game coins or for mobile phone credit After receiving the money for a period of time The money will be transferred to your phone account or game account. Usually, they will also provide some benefits to attract more people to participate For example, top up 80 and get 100 it is very tempting right? Many people will take the bait You click on the link and paid 80 You though it goes to the operator's platform, but in fact the money is transferred to a money laundering intermediary. This money laundering intermediary will match it to the other end, for example, the money obtained through fraud or some illegal gambling platform money and then transfer the 100 to your account, forming a closed loop you unknowingly become an accomplice of money laundering. Because it takes some time to match the stolen money here so this is called delay credit top up which takes one or two days to get into account The intermediary may tell you that there is a queue and the server is currently congested and busy Actually behind the scene the might be busy defrauding This is an example money laundering intermediary may disguise themselves as various forms of top ups to deceive you, so please don't take advantage of such thing Otherwise, when your account is blocked or the police come to find you, don't blame me for not reminding you. When you look at the shell company transfer, it is actually using national borders as a barrier, using privacy protection as layers and erase traces this delayed credit top up is using strangers' accounts for layering and erase traces. What is the advance model of layering? That is even the peopple involved becomes different You send money to A, but B transfer it to you. Actually A and B are accomplice but on the surface they may have no relationship at all, and they launder the money without knowing The gameplay is an underground bank. An underground bank is a hidden underground banking system. the accounts of a large number of individuals and companies appear to have nothing to do with each other but in fact they are a community of interests. As you can imagine, this kind of underground bank is very troublesome for regulatory agencies. It takes advantage of the illusory trust between people, so you can't detect some clues from transfer information. Of course, regulatory agencies are also constantly upgrading their monitoring technology. For example, Singapore applied a new AI-based detection method to network various payment systems as much as possible, and then cross-checked to find some suspicious behaviors. For example, why did your device log in to thousands of accounts at once or why so many devices and so many accounts connected to same WiFi? Why these 2 accounts keep doing reverse transactions? They try to find the patterns from these complicated information. We have talked about so many ways of money laundering today. Let's take a look at the largest money laundering case in Singapore First, these criminals will transfer the stolen money among various shell companies around the world. Then, do you know how he bypassed the review of Singapore bank regulations? It seems particularly low they forge certificate They forge a statement of a major domestic bank as proof of their wealth. They also forged proof of selling a house saying that I got the money from selling a house they even forge employment confirmation That's it, it's passed. Actually forging certificates is also a common trick of money laundering, But I think it is a bit too simple, so when I talked about those tricks just now, I didn't mention it at all Then these assets were transferred to Singapore, transferred to Dubai, transferred to the UK, hundreds of properties were purchased, luxury cars, yachts, cryptocurrencies, etc. But let me tell you, they were exposed because of this forged certificate. In 2021, a bank found a fake property certificate and began the investigation that brought out a shocking money laundering case worth $3 billion and 27 people In the end, the ten people who were arrested were sentenced to thirteen to seventeen months in prison, and 95% to 100% of their property was confiscated. Basically, from May to July this year, they were paroled early for good behavior and permanently deported from Singapore. The sentences only targeted the money laundering part in Singapore. Does not include fraud and illegal gambling The confiscated assets were sold through auctions and other channels and entered into the Singapore government's funds. But as far as this case is concerned, on a narrower point the Singaporean government has made a lot of money It has confiscated billions of dollars. But the reputational cost of such a large money laundering case to Singapore is immeasurable, so Singapore has also quickly strengthened its review and revision on banks and real estates and amend Singapore's Anti-Corruption and Anti-Money Laundering Act Especially strengthened the asset review of overseas wealthy people making it very troublesome for many wealthy people to transfer their assets to Singapore or open a family office in Singapore. This has led to a very interesting phenomenon. You know what is it? In just the past two years, you will find that setting up family offices in Hong Kong has become very popular Some wealthy people will even choose to transfer assets from Singapore to Hong Kong. This has also brought such a large wave of capital inflows to Hong Kong. See how interesting this is This is a game that affects all Note that I am not saying that these rich people transfer their money to Hong Kong or choose to go to Hong Kong, saying that their money is dirty I do not mean that. I also asked some people who are engaged in wealth management these rich people find it troublesome. They chose Singapore and Hong Kong because they wanted capital to flow freely and smoothly. hoping it would be more efficient and faster. Now Singapore has added so many regulations checking this and that so some people choose Hong Kong because they find this troublesome This actually explains that why those tax havens are so uncooperative with the advancement of global anti-money laundering See we talk about global game again when talking about money laundering This global anti-money laundering system, especially in financially developed areas, I feel like it is a bit like a balloon. It seems airtight and perfect but it may burst with a poke. Do you know what is the first principle of money laundering it is called Know Your Customer It is also called KYC. Those of you who work in banks, especially some European and American banks, must be very familiar with the term KYC. If you want to know your customer, how do you understand it? You need to understand their business and intentions. This is actually reasonable because the methods of money laundering is changing rapidly Bank regulatory rules are difficult to keep up with the speed of money laundering evolution. They can only rely on front-line account managers to conduct subjective judgement There are many loopholes in this Otherwise, how could such a big money laundering case $3 billion almost got through with forged certificates? including the mirror transaction we just mentioned. One of the very important reasons here is Deutsche Bank traders did not report it so that these money launderers could do cross-border transactions. Bank supervision that seemed very strict actually relies on the front-line account managers and sales staff. There is actually an interesting conflict of interest here. If you think about it, as an account manager, my performance is mainly aimed at attracting customers' money. Anti-money laundering supervision requires me to chase customers all day long, ask a lot of questions, and check a lot of information about them. This is actually very detrimental to attract customers, right? So when the compliance departments of some banks want to promote some anti-money laundering reviews the account managers are the first to get upset. If you do this, making customers go through so many processes then we wont be having any customers at all So what will happen sometimes? These account managers may not implement or implement very laxly, because many things here are very subjective and some would even work with clients to fool supervision So you see it is a conflict of interest We won't go into details Why anti-money laundering is not going so well money laundering is now so rampant around the world because it is actually a huge gaming field. There are games between money launderers and regulators, and there are also games between countries Even within a country, there may also be a game between supervision and banks. It is actually very nuance. Finally, let me emphasize again that Money laundering is a crime. Money laundering is a crime. Do not launder money. Do not launder money. Do not launder money.
