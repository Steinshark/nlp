He was a famous scholar, He was a humanitarian, an author. Anyway, he decided to share his And even though he had five children, An orphan, 12-year-old boy. Kid had been pounded Troubled. Prone to violence. -Stop me if you know this one. Okay. So this good man And when the boy stole from him, When the boy failed in school, this man When the boy lied and cheated ...this good man showed compassion ...until the boy, who had never felt ...he finally did. The man had broken through. One week later, Killed the man and his wife in bed. They said some small things ...things a child might steal. No one knows for sure. The man's children were sent off The boy, the orphan, Just when he finally had a chance at life, -It's a well-known story. Did they? Maybe they didn't look Sometimes the answer's in front of you. I think the boy killed them. I think the boy did it. The boy was scared his foster parents ...and realize he wasn't worth it, And he couldn't bear the thought Would throw him away... ...like a piece of lint or a bottle cap. So... ...he decided not to find out. What do you think, Nicolai? You think you know me? You strike me as a sentimental man, That's surprising. I.... I don't possess that chip. I never could understand what comes ...except weakness. The men I killed, your men... ...I gave them a chance. They made their decision. I'm giving you -Thank you.
