The Indo-Pacific is home to rising and a fierce battle for supremacy. In one a global superpower by aggressively expanding its its military build-up, sprawling claims over the bring Taiwan under its control, it's clear that challenging any who dare to stand in the country that's increasingly standing in its can challenge easily. The United States. Now, the military infrastructure and presence, support, the U.S. does have is a technological edge and across vast distances with unparalleled precision arsenal? USS Lewis B. Puller, an extraordinary naval war between the U.S. and China. And that's terrified of this ship. But what makes USS Lewis and which problems was it made to address? Keep had a presence in the Indo-Pacific, World War II to the region. To continue its major military the U.S. built an airstrip on Canton Island, now miles south of Hawaii. As a key refueling the airfield was essential in preventing the or isolated by enemy forces. But then, World War away from the Pacific Islands, redirecting its during the Cold War. This pivot led to a period of policy concentrated on different fronts. Over the a vacuum that China has been eager to exploit, political maneuvering, and strategic partnerships. airstrip in Kiribati we just mentioned. China is the one that wants to take control Though the Kiribati government claims that this civilian purposes - to improve transport links to Hawaii makes it a potential asset for military underscores the broader challenge the U.S. faces being increasingly contested by China's assertive China could very well undermine regional security to U.S. territory than ever. With this in mind, the region to understand how USS Lewis B. Puller the U.S. faces in the Indo-Pacific is China's including Kiribati and the Solomon Islands. nations, allowing it to deploy Chinese military does this matter? Well, it's simple. If China's location, the U.S. will likely lose its access to Besides swaying nations in the Indo-Pacific to diplomatically. You see, Beijing has successfully including Nauru and Solomon Islands, to shift The goal? To further isolate Taiwan and undermine completely erode the U.S. diplomatic standing and under Chinese control. China is pursuing this goal too, trying to strengthen its foothold in the of projects in the region, including the Tonga's Fiji, each of them strategically positioned to and, of course, challenge U.S. dominance. With the region and beyond, seeking to reshape the China and the U.S. can't be ruled out. In fact, are almost making such a clash inevitable. Now, if this conflict were to erupt. After all, the economic strength, and global alliances. How things aren't as simple. In the very region Indo-Pacific - almost everything is working potential conflict nothing short of a nightmare. a successful conflict in terms of logistics? connected military bases. Take the Cold War as an with its No. 1 enemy--the Soviet Union--so it military bases stretching from Italy to Germany. the U.S.'s military operations in the Northern theater at the time. But the Northern European contiguous U.S., which occupies about 3 million hand, covers roughly 60 million square miles. surface! So, even though the U.S. has military that the bases are too far apart from each other roughly 400 military bases the U.S. controls in are those located in countries like Japan, South 120 active bases, making it the country with followed by Germany with 119 and South Korea with and around Okinawa, a strategically vital region Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula. Though all of Japan, it's important to note that not all of them these bases are nothing but single antenna sites. flashpoints in the Indo-Pacific are the bases distance from potential conflict areas isn't the posture of its military forces to address rising rundown state. The island's infrastructure, roads, the airfield runways...virtually everything was in U.S. has since heavily invested in Guam, with the extensive scope of repairs and upgrades the most advanced and well-equipped U.S. military on the U.S. mainland, such as ones in California state-of-the-art infrastructure, extensive support and logistics networks. However, while these readiness, their distance from the Indo-Pacific immediate regional operations. So, basically, trilemma involves balancing three critical factors in Japan and South Korea are closest to potential face issues of resource constraints and local infrastructure and technology but are thousands East China Sea, Korean Peninsula, South China Sea, have strategic importance but struggle with effectiveness. From this alone, you can probably has been labeled as one of the - if not the - most in the Pacific. The math is simple - the further complex and resource-intensive the operation challenge for your opponent. But as we previously on its side. It also has numerous regional warfare - which enhance its strategic positioning That's why the U.S. Coast Guard cutter (USCGC) Solomon Islands in August 2022. And why the USCGC for the same purpose on time in January 2023. these incidents as bureaucratic mishaps all they only confirm one thing - China's influence reaches the U.S. partners in South and Southeast Asia are China. Other vital elements of warfare logistics numerous command and control centers, complex of military equipment...you name it, and China's is mostly left to its own devices in the region, in the Indo-Pacific. After all, the U.S. is defense responsibilities within these alliances. readiness in the region, it had to do it on its such as sealift, simply aren't viable in of enemy ballistic missiles, China's expanding and, of course, the tyranny of distance. That's or ESBs for short. Simply put, ESBs are floating traditional warships designed for combat. ESBs range of military operations, with an emphasis on zones. These bases basically allow the U.S. to areas without relying on vulnerable land bases aircraft carriers that act like an air base at mobile ports. And then, you have the ESBs, which sea. A $650 million floating garage! As such, low-intensity missions, allowing the U.S. Navy warships and amphibious warfare ships to don't confuse low intensity with low importance. their role is critical in sustaining long-term clearance, special operations, drone launches, allow high-intensity tasks to take place. As B. Puller is one of these game-changing vessels. B. Puller is the first purpose-built ESB vessel the second ship to be named in honor of Lieutenant Puller is the most decorated Marine in American and one Distinguished Service Cross during his 37 Cross for the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in 1950 highlighting his "unflagging determination" that employment [of the troops]," "[keep open the main of all casualties," and "[assure] the safety of have been lost to the enemy." Interestingly, him - USS Lewis B. Puller - shares the legacy Lieutenant General Puller embodied. USS Lewis delivered in June 2015, and commissioned in Bahrain, becoming the first U.S.-built ship to the ship's prefix changed from USNS - United Ship. The reason for this change lies in the Law active combat operations must be designated as USS hull classification also changed from T-ESB-3 to sailors rather than civilian mariners. Since USS vessel, it shouldn't be surprising it's also the This class consists of five other vessels: USS John L. Canley USS Robert E. Simanek USS Hector first three ships to deploy - in February 2024 - under construction. When the leader among these the former Commander of Naval Forces Central it as a "revolutionary concept." His exact but a revolutionary concept; a ship that provides to a variety of operations." So, let's see what supports. There's no doubt about it - USS Lewis The same goes for its silhouette, which stands expansive flight deck, which makes it resemble based on the hull of the civilian Alaska-class keep the costs relatively low compared to other a San Antonio-class ship, designed for while an ESB like the Puller can be built for National Steel and Shipbuilding Company created an off-the-shelf Alaska-class tanker and adding a one of the Puller's main capabilities. It also has a mission deck, and ample crew and supplies room. abundantly clear why China is terrified of this most prominent feature - the massive flight approximately the size of a football field, making Navy inventory, behind only the actual aircraft typically span more than three football fields. 764-foot long ship, is large enough to land the primary assault support aircraft for the the Marine Corps' primary heavy lift helicopter. and two MH-53s to land simultaneously, which flexibility and capability in supporting various rotary-wing landing spots, while the latter space. A variety of other helicopters can also the smaller Bell AH-1 Cobra single-engine attack helicopter. The only aircraft you'll never see on as the heat from its exhaust could damage military assets you'll find on the Puller. This operation, and recovery of various unmanned Insitu ScanEagle surveillance and reconnaissance multi-mission capability are just some examples. reach by providing real-time intelligence and missions and enhancing situational awareness. entire swarms of these drones can be launched and into a mobile command center that can project Indo-Pacific. Speaking of command centers, USS and control capabilities. With over 2 megawatts space for information fusion, it can serve as integrating real-time data from multiple sources. data, this ship has the necessary capabilities for maintaining operational security and ensuring potential adversaries. These capabilities become is China, a country known for its sophisticated B. Puller that deserves attention is its advanced landing deck we mentioned previously, this ship for storing and maintaining aircraft. The hangar's ensuring they are kept in optimal condition and we've used words like "massive" and "spacious" that USS Lewis B. Puller also offers ample crew this ship. As far as crew goes, this ship can including special operations teams. A typical personnel and 101 military support staff, and operational needs. The military crew on this and the Gold Crew alternating on and off the hull originally introduced for the U.S. Navy's fleet across various naval platforms. The goal of this to always stay deployed and operate in hazardous they can be stored both above and under the deck. equipment to be stored on deck, including up The latter refers to approximately 82,000 including an ordnance storage magazine, underway for the installation of containerized mission which can also be launched from the Puller. you should know about USS Lewis B. Puller before maximum speed of the Puller is 15 knots, while its loaded, this ship displaces approximately 90,000 mass and stability needed for sustained operations even be armed, thanks to 12 stations reserved for mind-blowing specs out of the way, let's see how into real-world performance and effectiveness.

Puller help the U.S. best this rival this ship was designed with the logistics of a Admiral Donegan put it, this expeditionary sea meet the threats in the region head-on." And since "ever-evolving," the Puller was also designed to around the globe. So, this ship can be outfitted including: special forces missions, counter-piracy clearance and humanitarian aid and disaster relief extras to the ones the Puller can perform with surveillance, reconnaissance, and command and and control capabilities, the Puller is also awareness and relaying information. In the context assets, intelligence, and complex operations coordinated in real time from this vessel alone. and reinforcement, which makes it an essential rapid response capabilities. However, due to the be a game-changer in a conflict between the U.S. node. According to some estimates, ESBs like million gallons of cargo, which can either refuel various sea-based platforms at sea. To all you need to know is that amphibious assault gallons of cargo fuel. Even Nimitz-class aircraft can only carry about 3.5 million gallons of like the Puller could refuel an entire fleet of providing unprecedented logistical support the Puller isn't only carrying cargo fuel. to transport essential resources to U.S. troops cutting off their supply lines. The best part? Puller. They could also be directly transported the Puller can accommodate. This is undoubtedly too vast and contains insufficient U.S.-held logistics to be as effective or resilient. If China could easily target and bomb these the same can't be done with helicopters. These the need for extensive infrastructure. Spare U.S. troops needed, the Puller could swiftly operational capability and reinforcing the particular importance, as recent exercises in the gallons of water per day for hydration, hygiene, onboard desalination systems, the ship could carry extended periods, making it a vital lifeline USS Lewis B. Puller could resolve virtually all potential war with China in the Indo-Pacific. No bring critical supplies directly to troops in the Forbidden access to ports for refueling? It's all it to refuel sea-based platforms at sea, ensuring even if they can't dock at traditional refueling the Puller's ability to operate and deliver even in the most isolated locations. Threats the Puller's mobility and self-sufficiency mean bypassing vulnerable land-based supply routes. powerhouse capable of bridging gaps, sustaining in the face of any challenge posed by the vast and China fears it so much.
