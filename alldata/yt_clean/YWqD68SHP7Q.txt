The idea is simple: just beat the first level of Kirby. That's all. Surely it can't be that hard, yeah? Oh, also bosses spot every 30 seconds. Subscribe to see how much further we can break Kirby in the future. This will be fine. Why are we sinking? Why are we sinking? Gorimondo. Gorimondo? Where's Gorimondo going? Wait, what the hell? Okay, wait, where's he gone? I mean, I guess we don't need to see where we're going. I do know the level enough to know where I need to go. How's the mini boss gonna work with this? Okay, okay. No, I think this is fine. Wait, what's going on with that health bar? Once you get beyond here, Gorimondo will, like, despawn. Goodbye, Gorimondo. I've literally never gotten this far in my testing. Just keep doing the speedrun strategy. Are we safe? I don't want to jinx it. Nothing is appearing. Is everything still working? Did Gorimondo break it? Hey, I can just grab it while it's there, right? Oh, Whispy! I can just grab it while it's there, right? Did he hit the thing out of the way? Please, no! I was right there! Whispy, no! Whispy I was right there! Wait, I'm hitting him! I'm hitting him! I can't see him, but I am hitting him. I'm doing something to him. There I am! We got this! Wait, there it is! I can get the--I can get the thing! Please don't die, please don't die like this. What is this is an amazing camera view? Please, dude, it was right there. I was actually starting to think in my head, 'Oh man, I might--' The hell was that? Oh, it's his nut! CHAT: Taking rooftop gardens to a whole new level. DAN: This is hell. What? What hit me? Is this a soft lock? I don't think I can--oh! Hey there, friend. What if I kill this boss? [Talks as the boss] 'Release me, release me.' Oh God, it's Whispy again! It's a whole forest! No, stop it! No, dude, I was right there! Third attempt. The first two attempts didn't go swimmingly. I was walking into the objective. Kirby, you have big ole arms, you could have grabbed that! CHAT: So how's it feel to be the first person ever to die to Whispy's nuts? DAN: Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. What the hell was that? Hello? I turn around and, like, Fecto Forgo is gonna be, like, consuming my feet. Oh okay. Oh! Oh, hey there! Are you okay? Excuse me, sword guy, can't you see Dedede's having a breakdown? Do I have to fight you? My favorite boss, psychedelic King Dedede going through trauma. You okay? You--I'll--I'm gonna pat him on the back. It seems I'm unneeded. Oh God, he's being haunted! He's being haunted by The Phantom of the Paw-pera! That's the worst pun I've made in my life. Clawroline hitting the hammer back from the penguin. 'Pick. It. Up.' He's haunted by death. Alright, well anyway, I'm just gonna go free the Waddle Dees and, uh, beat the level. You guys, uh, just placid or like? Alright, bye. [Makes a scared noise] I want a boss to actually fight-- It's Dedede! No! It's just Dedede having a panic attack again! Poor guy! You thought you could get away from me and my post-traumatic stress disorder. Oh, just like the demons in my head, I am everywhere, Kirby! PTSDedede! And that's one's normal Dedede! [Laughs] Why are they all having panic attacks? What I know the goal is right there, but like, this feels unfair to win. This feels like bullying. Oh, hey there, Fecto Elfilis, or whatever you are. I was trying to be nice. I didn't want to just take them down and hit them in their lowest moment. I actually am gonna kill Fecto Forgo, though. Yeah, we did it! Okay, now I can actually just walk into the achievement thing. I think-- wait, look! It's the third Dedede. This one: happy! Depression cured! CHAT: Yay DAN: Yay! And the Waddle Dees should be safe. [Cheers] Stage 1-1 beaten. Though it doesn't feel morally right. Wait, you're right! That wasn't actually 1-1, was it? The real 1-1 is the arrival point. I didn't think that that one would have been as easy as it was. Truly, the easiest boss fights are with the ones who are fighting themselves. Oh my god! Oh, the forest is attacking! I love how you can't--[Laughs] He's peeking through the trees! Um, excuse me? Can I just sneak by you for a second so I get the sword ability? I'll be right back. Can I just get the sword? I prom-- Hey there, Dedede. No, Dedede's back! [Laughs] Hold on, I'll clear the way. Let me just chop the tree down from an area where he can't fight back. CHAT: Dede-depression will get the best of you. DAN: [Laughs] Dude, my stomach hurts. What's happening? [Voice saying monkey] I don't know what just happened. Oh, what am I--am I climbing him? I mounted Whispy for a second! Also, I'm not actually killing Gorimondo right now. What? Who dies here? My ears apparently! Oh, and apparently his eyes! [Makes confused noise] How are you crying? We did it, everybody. The boss is defeated, and we can move on. Why is the objective back here? Were you guarding Dedede kept it safe! We beat the level! Dede-depression, our hero. World 1-1: Cleared! [Cheers] [Laughs] What's happening right now? Oh my God, my cheeks. Wait, in town? Yeah, truly. What is really 1-1? The start of the game? The first level? Or is 1-1 the hub area? I don't know if bosses can spawn in Waddle Dee Town. But I'm willing to find out. My cheeks hurt from laughing. Meta Knight, you're posted up there, buddy. Meta Knight literally is posted up there to defend the town from bosses and invaders. [Laughs more] Well, it works. There's another! Why does he keep spawning? He's like the goddamn Slenderman! Just when I look away and I look back, he's there again. You know, this guy's just chilling. [Talking as Dedede] 'Boy is it okay not being depressed right now.' Oh Christ, uh, what? I'm sorry. Can I actually-- can I go into the theater? Honestly, guys, I feel the real 1-1 is the movie theater. I mean, it's the first place you unlock. [Laughs] He's here! I'm sorry, I shouldn't have taken him to see the To be fair, this is a very sad movie. Whispy again? Why is it always either the tree or a depressed penguin? There are other bosses in this game. Now I have to kill you in the middle of the movie theater! That Waddle Dee in the front row is like, 'Wow it's like it pops right out at you!' Sorry guys, it's a new IMAX 3D experience. Isn't Whispy the one that drops the thing? Can I actually complete the theater? No, there it is! It's Leon's soul! Erm, yes, sir, uh, one ticket for Mario movie and another ticket to the soul of my friend. Yeah, that'll be $8.99. It's going up. We did it! We got all the pieces! What the hell was that? CHAT: This is hurting my brain. DAN: It's hurting a lot of brains. Wait, why are there two Elfilins?! [Singing] 1 Waddle Dee, 2 Elfilins, and 2 dramatic Dededes! I guess the movie theater can be considered 1-1, but to be fair, we haven't actually fought someone in Waddle Dee Town. This is the REAL 1-1, right? Hello, can I get one McDouble? Sir, don't make me kick you out again. Wait, what happened? What happened? I thought I was eating my food. Oh no! That wasn't food! That's the thing they make Uh... the hell is this? Meta Knight! Um, why am I down here? Why is he down there? What's happening? Oh God, I have no idea where I am. Clawroline! Oh God, she's drowning! There she goes! I don't really know what's happening here. Oh, there he goes! Off to pursue Clawroline! Oh, hey there, Gorimondo. Oh, I don't like that shot! Can I fight you in the water? Are you programmed for this? Nope, nope. [Sh-Boom &quot;Life Could Be a Dream&quot; plays] Like the Titanic, we'll never see that one again. The next time we'll see Gorimondo is in the history books. Oh, never mind. He's right there. Uh, where is he now? Gorimondo? Oh, hey there. You're green now. Gorimondo, no! Jump! No! Grab my hand, Gorimondo, grab my hand! No! CHAT: Bro sunk. DAN: Yeah, forreal. You know, I'm not gonna lie, I don't think this is working out for us. Oh, hey. Cool, another tree. Wait, this is how it works out for us. Because they actually spawn the win condition, as long as we can kill Whispy. There it is! The soul! I just gotta grab that, and CHAT: What the hell is going on? DAN: That's a great question. Hey there, Meta Knight, sorry I keep forgetting about you. Oh, there's three of them! Four of them! Kirby, are you sure you don't want to grab that blueprint? [Overlapping voices talking about grabbing the blueprint] Anyway, so. Truly, chat, I think the real 1-1 is the world map, surely. There's no way. How would that work? We're gonna find out in 30 seconds. No way! How do I fight you? There he is! You can see him! [Laughs] No, is this Whispy? Oh no, it's the world tree! Am I playing? Hold on. Hold on. I can attack. I can attack, but it makes me try to return to Waddle Dee Town. Could I actually beat a boss on the world screen? I hit him into second phase! Where am I? Oh, this hurts to look at. I don't like this. Sorry for this, everybody. [Hit noises] I'm still hitting him! There's no shot. I feel I'm tapping into government secrets. We got him! We beat Whispy on the world map! What happens now? I can't move. I mean, I wonder why. That's not a good sign. [Game plays crashing sounds] Well. Uh. World 1-1 has been properly beat! Truly, the real 1-1, chat. You're right, you're so right. You're so right. The real 1-1 is the very first thing we see when we load up the game. Can a boss spawn in the title screen? Okay, I don't think it works. Boo, so you're telling me you have to actually play Kirby in order to beat a level? Boo! Or maybe we don't have to play Kirby for a boss to spawn. Wait, are we playing Kirby if we're doing a mini game? God only knows. I've actually never played this, by the way. Yup! Yup! Seems like we can! Now this is just obnoxious. Oh, it's depressed Dedede, isn't it? He's sad that Kirby's no longer paying attention to him. Excuse me! You booted me out of my minigame! Now that's just rude. This mini game is the first level. This is 1-1. I gotta pick up the speed, dude. Things are gonna start spawning fast. Are you guys excited for Tilt 'n' Tumble to be coming onto Switch? I have to beat it before a boss spawns. This is now a speed run of Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble, but if I don't beat it fast enough, PTSDedede comes by and cries on me. I think we're good, I think we're good. Yeah! World 1-1 has finally been beaten. Truly 1-1 is our home. Oh, no, Dedede! Welcome to my place, buddy, are you feeling any better? I'm sorry you're going through it, my guy. If you're feeling stressed, feel free to come on over and have a nap. Is this scripted? And if at any point, you feel like coming on over and reading a book. In my own home. Uh-oh. The real 1-1 is eating healthily. Oh, a tomato? Gotcha. Tomato? No problem. Another tomato? Okay. High demand, apparently. Meta Knight! I'm on the clock right now! Now I'm fired! Kirby's so sad he lost his job that he's gonna go jump into the ocean. This is the wildest form of this. Oh, one more Pepto-Bismol. Whispy! Can I keep working at least with Whispy? Whispy, my guy. One more try. One more try to do this. Oh God, I didn't feed him! He's starved! But truly, the biggest 1-1 of this game. Fishing. Oh, oh. We got the big fish, nice. Oh, hey there, Dedede! Well, this is truly Kirby and the Forgotten Lands.
