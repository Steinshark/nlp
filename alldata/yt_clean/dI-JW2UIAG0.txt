- The Saturn V rocket for the first time, but the It steered itself using a computer. - [Man] Tower, clear. - [Man] Gotta roll program. - A lot of the Saturn in Huntsville, Alabama, And one of the really cool is it's filled with aerospace who love this stuff, so a is pick up the phone and and have them call their you're in a parking lot, memory module from a guy you just met, and he just trusts that you're This is 14 kilobytes of data, because the same day I got this, I had Linus Sebastian We were installing a server Now, millions of people look to Linus to understand more about so I thought a really cool thing to do would be stop what we and take a closer look and how it works. Let's sit back and watch learn about the cutting edge I'm Destin, let's go - [Destin] Have you ever - [Linus] No. - [Destin] Okay, do you - [Linus] Yes. - [Destin] My daily around the Saturn V. Like, that's the Saturn V peeking out over the trees right there. - [Linus] Oh, there it is. Hello. - [Destin] In the 60s, they digital computers, and I'm that they used to steer that thing. - [Linus] I mean, it's gotta be a bit of a terrifying experience having, like, the equivalent of a very large bomb strapped to your butt. - So this is the brain If you look up right here, this and so they had computers This right here is the launch That is it. This right here is a memory module, okay? And if you look really, really close, you see - Yeah. - [Destin] OK, look right here. Look at that. Do you see that? - [Linus] Holy smokes, so they're, it looks like zip ties on chicken wire. - [Destin] Okay, those are bits. Those are physical bits. So you see that screen? - [Linus] Yeah. - [Destin] These are wires that go down to these boards right here, right? - [Linus] Yeah. - [Destin] On each node, and depending on how the that's a one or a zero. That's how they programmed this computer. Seriously. So look at this right here. - So by hand. - [Destin] By hand, yes. - They threaded these wires through the, I mean, who has a steady, you can build one of these That's incredible. - [Destin] So there's a in the 60s here. His name is Luke. - Yeah. - [Destin] And, you get ask - Fantastic. - I'm Luke Talley, and I was a senior associate - [Destin] So your computer - That's right. - [Destin] Awesome. - We steered the rocket. So that's a memory module. - [Destin] That's a whole - You musta shot somebody to get that. - [Destin] So how valuable - Well, now this, ah, I You have to go to Antique Roadshow. This computer controls all the timing. Start engine, stop engine, fire retro rockets, all this kinda stuff. It does navigation and guidance. You have stored in the memory a profile, at this point in time I need to be here, going this fast, going this direction. Now realize that this is core memory, so you have these magnetic cores, you have the wires you push a current down through a wire, if you've got a wire, current's the magnetic field is going If it's going this way, it'll be that way. Make that a one, make that a zero. There's 8192 of those on - [Linus] Yeah. - Then there's 14 of those planes stack up to make this module. This module is what you're holding. All this stuff now, the - That's just to program - Because this is basically - Right. - I'm not writing ones and and storing them that way. - You're just sending a current -- - I'm actually having to one way or the other. And then I've gotta read I destroy the magnetization, right back around and -- - Write it again. - Write it back in there, - Oh, no! - So there's one of these in this, and then there's one of these now in each one of these blocks - [Linus] Got it. - So we have four, 8, 12, another four, 8, 12, 16 Now when the Saturn's flying, are executing the same flight program. - [Linus] Completely in parallel? - That's right, and they're to make sure they're If they were to not get the same answer, go into the sub-routine and say, &quot;I'm at this point in the flight, I got these two numbers, to keep using,&quot; use that So your critical parts in the logic, dual As I recall, during we had like, less than 10 miscompares, something like that. It was a very small number. - When you're building a rocket, you have some important parameters that you have to monitor. Power, data bandwidth, mass, volume, you have to manage these so So you want a reliable you have to make a decision. How redundant is redundant enough? - Unreliability, that's the key, because the more of these things, the more core's you add, the the more unreliability because sheer numbers of parts. - Right. - Luke is about to to receive data from the and then analyze it, and because I want you to and difficult this task was. Today we could do this and some spreadsheet they were the computers. Like, the people were the computers. So I want you to see it through his eyes, through this historical what it was like to - So did you pull the data - Things happen too quick in flight to. - [Destin] How do you know you had -- - We get the data back and then we ana, that was my job at IBM, the flight data to determine what worked, what didn't work, if it how do we fix it on the next flight? - Got it. - And then when you get for the next flight, make in place to do what we so the data tapes come through Goddard Space for that, so they get us the and determine what happened. Something would go wrong in the computer, and it always goes wrong is messing up the telemetry actually get what they call an octal dump. We have this 11 by 17 sheet of so you'd have, there were four characters. Zero to seven's as high as So you got all these maybe 40 columns and 30 so we would get this thing printed out, and all it's just numbers, well, is in a particular place down here. Well, the drop out is where we, you know, telemetry dropout, we would 11 by 7 fanfold paper, get down on your hands and knees, make a template, cut out of measurements that'll like a bolt, it never those number's oughta be. So we cut the holes out and slide it down page by page, &quot;Oh, hey, &quot;Okay, this frame's probably good.&quot; So we go find so many find the number we want, write it down. - So you're looking for one -- - If it bungs up something then it probably bunged up something else. - That's right, and if then somewhere in there - And then once you've I mean, is that just the How do you solve that? - Well, no, you may have, for many, many, many frames. Then you take it to your desk convert 'em to decimal numbers, go to a calibration chart and say, &quot;Okay, I got this number.&quot; Go up my chart and say that means it's five degrees Centigrade. So you write down five degrees, then you figure out what frame you are, and that's about what time it is, so you're, &quot;At this time, Then you go to the next one. Now you do this for about two weeks, and finally you got enough So you put all these numbers in and you plot it by hand, and then you say, &quot;Hm, that wasn't the problem after all. &quot;Oh, well, here we go again.&quot; (laughs) - [Linus] Oh, boy. - [Destin] This is Ed. Ed is the head curator. - Hi, Linus, how are you? This is kind of an in-the-hand that you can see woven and then kinda under the and there's about eight So like Luke was saying, through there, it starts in a particular direction, whether it's the one or the zero. And you were saying they and it was primarily that had basically a bench top. - So they would have like I guess. - Um, I am actually not certain what their qualifications were, but they would sit with a bench top with this thing mounted in a holder with copper wire lengths and and a lot more patience than I have, to weave these things through there, to make sure they went no kinks, no bends that and to actually make sure go into across the way they should and that it was all uniform so everything would be - [Linus] Incredible. - [Destin] I just wanted you now you know what that's like. - I mean, this is, this so I'm holding at least a byte. (laughs) You can look at it that way. - [Destin] So when you look at this, what kind of emotion do you feel, when you look at this, Luke? Do you, do you, are you proud? - Is it fondness, or is it more just, &quot;Thank goodness I don't have to work on that bloody thing any more&quot;? - No, I'm gonna talk to one of my buddies when you go out the building, see if he'd hit you in the head. (laughs) - [Destin] To get this thing? - Yeah. No, that's a real piece of work, and it looks, to people that come in here, they say this just looks But again, we only had a few failures during the whole flight We never had a catastrophic failure. - People might say antique, but I would say hand-crafted. - Yes, it was a lot of - [Linus] Oh, you can even these are clearly hand-baked. - Well, they got the goop on 'em because the big problem with The memory that we were - Yeah, you got physical rings on there. - They test and test to make sure that you or a twist, 'cause if gonna cause it to break. Those things were made by hand. The ladies actually wove these things like you're weaving a piece of cloth. Pretty amazing. - [Linus] Oh, this is fascinating. Thank you very much, by the way. - I wanna say thanks to the sponsor today, which is audible. I'm about to recommend a 13-hour audiobook about salt, and you're but I'm not, 'cause it's amazing. This is a book called by Mark Kurlansky, and it is amazing. Like everything from Natron to why Civil War battles because there were certain to why Gandhi walked to the ocean. And it also tells you about, like, garum, which is a Roman sauce, that we don't even know This audiobook is amazing, You can get is by going or texting the word &quot;smarter&quot; to 500-500. I know it would make more sense to recommend an audiobook about space but this is what I'm actually listening to and it's incredible. So audible.com/smarter, or text the word &quot;smarter&quot; to 500-500, get plus two free audible originals when you try audible for 30 audible.com/smarter. You will love this book, please do that. That supports &quot;Smarter Every Day.&quot; When you support &quot;Smarter Every Day,&quot; it lets me do more videos If you want to see more between Linus and Luke, it's incredible. Like on the second channel, of Luke going all the This guy knows his stuff. Like, I feel like I know Linus certainly knows computers, but when we're sitting Luke could just run around both of us. Go check that out on the second channel. Also go check out Linus's channel. Actually, I'll just let Go check out Linus's He's talking about, - The instrument unit, about the computer but information on that, but I really love the cooling system on this thing, it's gonna blow your guys's mind. Unreal. - It's awesome, it's at because as you got all three you need your instrument unit way up here so you can guide the Saturn V before the Apollo computer takes over, but Linus talks about details of power and how that stuff works. It's pretty cool. - Yeah. - [Destin] Thanks, dude, appreciate it. - See you guys. Thank you. - [Kids] You're welcome! - Thanks, guys! - [Destin] It's called space camp. - Space camp. - [Destin] Yeah, so all how to be astronauts and fighter pilots. That's Luke. - [Linus] No! - [Destin] That's Luke. - No way! On the left there, apparently. - [Destin] That's pretty cool, huh? - [Linus] Luke Talley, That's nice. - [Destin] That's pretty neat, isn't it?
