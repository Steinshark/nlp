&gt;&gt; Restoration of a 1970 Jazzbass was requested. &gt;&gt; This jazzbass is covered in tar stains and has unknown specifications. &gt;&gt; When it arrived to me, it had no bridge piece and no strings. &gt;&gt; The truss rod had been tightened and was warped backwards. &gt;&gt; I spent two months looking at the neck. &gt;&gt; I tightened the truss rod a little and it stabilized. &gt;&gt; There is room on the truss rod. &gt;&gt; Fretting will be re-fretted, cleaned and rusted out. &gt;&gt; The concern is the floating position marks. &gt;&gt; Remove parts. The pegs are too hard to turn. &gt;&gt; The whole thing is sticky with tar. &gt;&gt; Where did someone play and for how long? &gt;&gt; The fretboard is not rubbing together, so I have to re-fret the fretboard. &gt;&gt; The bridge and bezels are rusted by sweat. The paint is also peeling. &gt;&gt; The pickups have already been replaced. &gt;&gt; The pickguard is bent. Screws are different sizes. &gt;&gt; All will be replaced with new ones. &gt;&gt; Pot and condenser are original. Solder is messy. &gt;&gt; Pot date could not be confirmed due to dirt. &gt;&gt; Pickups are probably DiMaggio. &gt;&gt; Very dirty. The height of the hole piece can be changed. &gt;&gt; Vacuum cleaner sucks out the dust. &gt;&gt; Polishing this. &gt;&gt; Polish it with a polish that can be used on lacquered surfaces. &gt;&gt; Soda water is also used. &gt;&gt; The stain is great. &gt;&gt; More brown-stained cloth toothpicks. &gt;&gt; Hands get dirty. &gt;&gt; I forgot to wear gloves. &gt;&gt; It took me several days to clean it because I couldn't finish it in one day. &gt;&gt; The paint is cracked so I polish it lightly. &gt;&gt; The paint on the back is glossy. &gt;&gt; Metal parts are polished with metal polish. &gt;&gt; Polish with Blue Magic. &gt;&gt; It is now clean. &gt;&gt; Soak the pegs in sesquicarbonate of soda water. &gt;&gt; Scrub with a toothbrush to remove dirt. &gt;&gt; Polish with polish. &gt;&gt; This peg cannot be disassembled any further. &gt;&gt; The shape is difficult to polish. &gt;&gt; It is now clean. &gt;&gt; You can see it is now clean by comparison. &gt;&gt; Rust on the bridge cannot be removed. &gt;&gt; Scratches are not removed, but rust has been removed. &gt;&gt; The ground plate is also polished. &gt;&gt; The corroded area was not cleaned. &gt;&gt; No problem as long as the power is energized. &gt;&gt; Hard-to-polish parts are fixed and polished. &gt;&gt; The parts are now clean. &gt;&gt; Polishing of metal parts is finished. All screws are to be renewed. &gt;&gt; The fretboard is cleared to remove the frets. &gt;&gt; Shaving with a design knife and a carving knife. &gt;&gt; The frets are removed. &gt;&gt; Make a cut in the clear with a knife. &gt;&gt; Sharpen the place where the blade will be inserted. &gt;&gt; If the blade goes in, it is OK. &gt;&gt; The fret has been removed. &gt;&gt; Shave off the old clear. &gt;&gt; Glue the position marks. &gt;&gt; All position marks are glued. &gt;&gt; Shave the fingerboard with a 7.25" sanding block. &gt;&gt; 7.25" R is attached. &gt;&gt; Clean the fret grooves. &gt;&gt; The depth is too shallow, so I cut all the way down to the edge. &gt;&gt; Check the fretboard with the fretboard to be used. &gt;&gt; The depth is OK. &gt;&gt; Clean the head. &gt;&gt; Overlacquer the head. &gt;&gt; Although it is vintage 1970, &gt;&gt; Restore for practicality. &gt;&gt; Dirt and dust are removed. &gt;&gt; The bone nut is shaved. &gt;&gt; The bottom has the same curved surface as the fingerboard. &gt;&gt; Completed. &gt;&gt; Gluing in place. &gt;&gt; Prepare to strike the frets &gt;&gt; Shave the fret tangs. &gt;&gt; Strike by hand. &gt;&gt; Use JESCAR #47014. &gt;&gt; Use glue. &gt;&gt; Shave the sides of the frets. &gt;&gt; Shave the side of the frets after this. &gt;&gt; Paint the fingerboard. &gt;&gt; Paint the sealer. &gt;&gt; The color is amber with some tobacco brown. &gt;&gt; Lacquer top is sprayed 11 times. &gt;&gt; The back of the neck is also over-lacquered. &gt;&gt; The lacquer top was sprayed 11 times. &gt;&gt; While the neck is drying, the body is completed. &gt;&gt; The screw holes are refilled. &gt;&gt; Fill with 3mm round bar. &gt;&gt; The holes in the neck are also refilled. &gt;&gt; Make a round bar of maple and fill it in. &gt;&gt; It is a mystery why the neck hole is filled in again. &gt;&gt; The pick guard is replaced with one that can be bought now. &gt;&gt; The pot is also replaced with a new one because it is very dirty. &gt;&gt; Only the capacitor will be transplanted. &gt;&gt; The solder is dirty. It may have been done by the old owner. &gt;&gt; Use new CTS. &gt;&gt; Use Switchcraft for the jack. &gt;&gt; Install on a polished and cleaned plate. &gt;&gt; Pickups are replaced with new ones. &gt;&gt; SEYMOUR DUNCAN ANTIQUTY is installed. &gt;&gt; It is aged from the beginning and matches this bass. &gt;&gt; Wiring is fine. &gt;&gt; The control knobs have also been cleaned. &gt;&gt; Paint drying time was short, so I polished by hand. &gt;&gt; Tolecut is used for water polishing. &gt;&gt; Polished by hand without buffing. &gt;&gt; Match the atmosphere of this base. &gt;&gt; Polishing by hand matches the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Remove the clear over the frets. &gt;&gt; Install the pegs before the frets are mortised. &gt;&gt; The flathead screw pegs are installed on the first string. &gt;&gt; Polished string guides are also installed. &gt;&gt; Dig a groove in the nut. &gt;&gt; Nut machining is easy on a bass. &gt;&gt; But don't cut too much. &gt;&gt; String the strings and then fret fret rubbing. &gt;&gt; Neck warp should be straight. &gt;&gt; Fix the bass and mortise it. &gt;&gt; Check the frets repeatedly. &gt;&gt; The mortise is finished. &gt;&gt; Round the top of the frets with a Z-FILE. &gt;&gt; Z-FILE is easy to use. &gt;&gt; Use masking tape with weak adhesive. &gt;&gt; Polishing the frets is very painful. &gt;&gt; Polish the frets with polish. &gt;&gt; Polish the entire neck again. &gt;&gt; Polish with GIBSON Pump Polish. &gt;&gt; The neck is finished. &gt;&gt; String and adjust the nut. &gt;&gt; Shave the nut so that there is a gap of 0.09mm on the first fret. &gt;&gt; The gap is now 0.07mm. &gt;&gt; Shave the shape of the nut. &gt;&gt; The nut is now complete. &gt;&gt; Final adjustments are made. &gt;&gt; String height is set to 2 mm above 20F. &gt;&gt; Check to make sure that the sound is not clogged up. &gt;&gt; Restoration of the precious bass is finished. &gt;&gt; The neck condition was good although it was dirty. &gt;&gt; It was successfully completed. The owner liked it. Thank you for watching to the end.
