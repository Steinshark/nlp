(glass shatters) - [Mark Rober] This guy and a different guy stole and he's about to open it in his car. - Hello. (glitter bomb pops) - But what he doesn't realize is this is the fourth generation of a new and improved that is recording him on four phones and just released a pound of And he's about to discover for this year. Now I know what you're thinking. &quot;Isn't it a bit excessive to spend the last four years of your the perfect revenge for porch pirates just 'cause someone stole and the police wouldn't And to that, I say no. And I'm gonna keep until we can make a dent that are stolen from porches every year. Plus, it's become such a for me to try and think that we can upgrade it each year. And so with that, this (car horn blaring) And that is the first of five The lid shoots off as tries to open it. Our original design to pull that spun up at irresponsibly Then we lowered these with the flywheel, and they which then used a rack and But that was just way too over-engineered, even for my lofty So that's when we pivoted But space is limited in the box, so we had to custom design with a little help from They hooked me up and made which was why they're for quick turnaround So the tank is filled with and it's nestled here in the base. And then with the top half on, this hall effect sensor attached to the lid. So when the lid is lifted, to rush into the pistons, and the boxing gloves do the rest. And the second major 'cause that just feels more exciting for everyone. So when the lid first pops off- (car horn blaring) It actually sounds a And the third upgrade is the design of the glitter cup itself. This year, instead of that spins all the we have a two-chambered cup like this, which means we get to fire the So the way it works is you pour glitter in the top chamber here, and And when the cup spins, the flies up and out the sides, but the glitter in the due to the centrifugal force. Then when the cup stops spinning, gravity basically loads in the lower chamber for us. And so now of course it's ready to fly out on the next spin and so on. This totally passive solution means we get to save one of our for when we get to the end of the out loud countdown sequence. - [Robotic Voice] One. (motor whirring) - [Mark] Now of course you'll still see the standard four phones in all directions and upload as well as these four canisters filled with 20% more fart spray of legitimately the worst smell as demonstrated by the time I almost killed Macaulay Culkin himself. - (coughs) I can still smell it. (Macaulay chokes) - [Mark] The fourth upgrade is we have a dedicated onboard microphone once the package is stolen, and the fifth is this outer this opaque machined acrylic. That means the entire glitter to light up the scene if and it just looks really dope when the whole box pulses red and blue as we play the fake police scanner chatter a few minutes after being opened- (police radio chattering) - To further encourage the thief to get rid of the box And then the final upgrade for this year isn't actually on the glitter bomb itself. Last year we developed these doormats that would covertly charge so it would be at full battery And that was fantastic, but a lot of boxes were being taken at night, which was leading to footage So to solve for that this year, we designed these planter boxes, and when the sun goes and they autonomously slide over to swallow up the glitter bomb, concealing it from any without the homeowner bringing it in and out every day. Then of course in the morning, the process reverses and So now when the bad guy and steals it off the porch, the batteries are all at 100% charge, and the box knows it's so it starts recording and in addition to texting and sending GPS location updates. And so if you compare you can really see the design evolution. And while my lawyers have that I am not allowed to sell this, if I did, it might look - [Announcer] Glitter Bomb 4.0 is our most advanced glitter bomb ever. Beautiful, complex, yet simple. A sleek and porch-informed design, now includes a car horn and 20% more fart spray. A completely redesigned with a pound of our finest means your porch pirate for a very long time, but especially in direct sunlight. Oh, and there is one more thing. Introducing the world's (epic orchestral music) Glitter Bomb 4.0. (epic orchestral music) Because sometimes revenge is (epic orchestral music) - So there it is. And while you can't buy Glitter Bomb 4.0, if you wanna support you can rock this stylish wire frame Glitter Bomb hoodie here, or we've also got this cool with the boxing gloves, available, of course, And so now all that was left to do was to put it out on porches And we didn't have to wait long. (playful music) Wait a sec. Is that who I think it is? And sure enough, Fort Knuts so instead of trying to make Fat Gus had apparently And speaking of which, I'd that whether squirrels are so you build them an obstacle course, or humans are stealing your packages so you go full &quot;Home Alone,&quot; the beauty about being an engineer is you can come up with clever solutions for your real-life challenges. (bell dings) It's like a superpower, but and I'd love to see other Which is why a few times a year I teach a month-long and enrollment for the starting right now. Over the course of a month, you're gonna watch me design and create three builds from scratch. But the best part is I'm gonna three creative builds of your own. So whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced engineer, the class has been designed and level up your skills. Just go to monthly.com/markrober, or use the link in the video description, then go sign up as a New and let's hang out making some cool stuff. And now for the sparkly karma. (color bar beeps) (car horn blares) (motor whirring) (cartoon voice laughs) (motor whirring) So he hides it under some clothes, and a few minutes later (beep) - [Thief 1] It's a tracking device! - [Thief 2] Oh, no, no, no, no! - [Thief 1] And it smells like (beep). - [Thief 2] What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? (motor whirring) (color bar beeps) (car horn blares) (motor whirring) - [Gangster] Keep the - [Mark] This guy wins the award for our most contemplative thief ever. (motor whirring) I've sped this footage up to double time. So we help to make up his mind with a third round of glitter, fart spray, and then the countdown. (motor whirring) (motor whirring) - [Robotic Voice] 15, 14- (color bar beeps) - [Mark] And as if stealing a glitter bomb wasn't a bad enough choice already, this guy doubles down and (motor whirring) (cartoon voice laughs) - [Thief] (beep). (beep), man. (motor whirring) (car horn blares) (motor whirring) (motor whirring) - [Robotic Voice] Fifteen, fourteen. Three, two, one. (package clatters) - [Mark] And it's worth we have to make multiple glitter bombs, because sometimes they do take a beating. (color bar beeps) And yet they battle through (motor whirring) (color bar beeps) - [Thief 1] Look what I found! - [Thief 2] Did they see you take it? - [Thief 1] Nobody saw me. - [Thief 2] Like Harry and Marv. - [Mark] And they're shipping label here, with Harry - [Thief 1] I feel bad, but I - [Thief 2] I say you flip a coin. Heads you keep it. - [Mark] And apparently they landed heads, 'cause a few hours later, this happened. (car horn blares) (motor whirring) (cartoon voice laughs) - [Thief 1] What the (beep)? (motor whirring) (color bar beeps) - [Mark] This guy stole it and took it straight to a pawn shop to - [Thief] 500. - [Pawnbroker] No, I told you 400. - [Thief] No, give me one - No. This thing is brand new, (beep). Come on. - [Pawnbroker] The wrapping - [Thief] No, they're 2021. - [Pawnbroker] Let me open it and see if it's just in there first. - [Thief] One more hundred, (beep). One more hundred. - [Thief] Yeah, go ahead. (car horn blares) - What the (beep)? (motor whirring) (cartoon voice laughs) - [Mark] And this one's hilarious to me, 'cause if he wouldn't have got greedy, he could have walked out - [Woman] It's a bomb. Yeah, yeah. Put it outside! (motor whirring) - [Robotic Voice] Fifteen, fourteen- - [Mark] And instead, he gets zero dollars and a bedazzled jacket. - [Robotic Voice] Detonation imminent. (color bar beeps) - [Thief 1] Oh my God, look it. (car horn blaring) (motor whirring) (cartoon voice laughs) - [Thief 2] Maybe they so it went off. - [Thief 1] Did you see and hear that? (motor whirring) - [Thief 2] Put it back down. - [Thief 1] Really? - [Thief 2] Each time, - [Thief 1] It stinks too. - [Thief 2] Oh (beep), babe. Look at how full it is. (motor whirring) (motor whirring) (color bar beeps) (car horn blares) (motor whirring) (cartoon voice laughs) - Oh. (laughs) It's a trick. Someone fooled you. (motor whirring) - Oh! Ugh, it stinks! - Move. - [Woman] Go throw it away. - Oh, (beep). Smells like (beep). No! (motor whirring) (motor whirring) - [Mark] They eventually threw it away, and then went the extra all the glitter. (speaker screeches) Followed up with a light dusting. (broom thuds) (broom thuds) (color bar beeps) Last year, if you might recall, a.k.a. the car break-in and got a glitter bomb taken And while we never got them it did have an interesting conclusion. - [Thief] I could bang it. I could bang- (alarm blaring) (static crackles) - [Mark] So this year, and at the end of day But then we stopped for like two minutes to get some snacks for the trip home, and when we came back They took the backpack with the GoPros but left the freaking glitter bomb. So now it was definitely on. So we went back to that and within 10 minutes, this happened. (window shatters) (window shatters) And you could see here - [Thief 1] Put that in the back, bro. - [Mark] You can literally hear them doing another smash and grab here, not four minutes after - [Thief 1] Come on, come (beep), hurry up! Let's go! Yo, what the (beep)?! Yo, (beep)! - [Mark] And unfortunately, of stolen goods, the glitter (car horn blares) (motor whirring) - [Thief 1] What was that? - [Mark] And they were onto us. - [Thief 2] That (beep) - [Thief 1] What you talking about, boss? - [Thief 2] Look, (beep). Yo, what the (beep) is that? Throw that out, baby. - [Thief 1] Hell nah. - So if we're keeping track at home, that's car thieves with three without a single ounce Now I'm not proud of that, but there is a silver lining here, because the police rolled up and let's just say they and fans of, the work being done here. In fact, they were that smashed our window, So next year I'll be in some capacity, and I'm that I'm gonna get some and perhaps uncover how these in the process. So make sure you're subscribed But it wasn't just the the glitter bomb this year. Just like before, we also by a few group mailboxes, and I'm happy to report the do the right thing and or even go out of their In fact, they were stolen as last year, so either people are getting more honest, or perhaps, I don't know, enough people have seen these videos that it's the devastating power of glitter that's encouraging more civil behavior. And I'll just leave you that kind of seem to (color bar beeps) - [Thief 1] I was lucky. That's a lucky steal right there, man. Best that money can buy. (car horn blares) - [Thief 2] Oh, (beep). (motor whirring) Oh, you son of a (beep). - [Thief 1] Oh, it's one of those gifts? - [Thief 2] Oh, wow. I seen that on TV, man. - [Thief 1] What's it do? - [Thief 2] Put that top back on. - [Thief 1] Why? (motor whirring) - [Thief 2] The glitter was that sticky kind. That's what you get for from in front of their house. God, right in my house. (beep) That thing has a tracer on it too. The cops are gonna be right outside. (color bar beeps) - [Thief] Then I'm wondering if it's one of those (beep) package thief things that spay out fart glitter. If this thing is gonna start talking and five, four, three, two, one. (car horn blares) It is! (motor whirring) - [Mark] So just don't steal But if you do need some extra incentive, just know you might be opening - [Thief] It is one of And it has fart smell and everything. - [Mark] And trust me, you (motor whirring) (tense music)
