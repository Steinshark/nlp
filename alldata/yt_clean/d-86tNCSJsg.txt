Although their simple brains were they were not content with what they could So they invented telescopes to peer into the smash matter into its constituent parts. And in the universe actually works.\par Although they didn\rquote t actually manage \par got two fundamental theories that describe to join them together. On one end we describe with each other with quantum field theory strong and nuclear weak forces. And at the explains how objects influence each other otherwise known as gravity.\par These two theories are the most complete description have been tested and verified to incredible Gravity isn\rquote t described in quantum nothing about the quantum world.\par Big deal, you might say. If they are each s no problem. But there is a problem. In between in physics: black holes and the big bang. and general relativity meet, and we won\rquote develop a theory of quantum gravity, the fundamental \par are string theory or M-Theory and loop quantum evidence to back them up, for example string called supersymmetric particles which we haven\rquote hypothetical.\par I should mention that, in practice, we don\rquote relativity to model everything in physics. we actually use a whole suite of other theories those specific situations. But quantum field because they are the most fundamental theories.\par So why has it been so long since we\rquote relativity was published in 1915, and quantum s. Why has there been very little progress The force of gravity is so much weaker than where something significantly feels all of perhaps impossible.\par Gravity only becomes strong when you are dealing it takes the whole Earth to keep you on the or planets or stars, quantum effects just \par is down at the scale of atoms and subatomic light that the force they feel due to gravity For example, two electrons centimetre apart charges but attract each other due to their charge is ten to the power of twenty four from gravity. That is 24 orders of magnitude in the twenty fourth decimal place of the \par places where you have a huge amount of matter always incredibly high energy situations, \par can create experimentally given our current we would need a particle accelerator like detectors the size of Jupiter to get to the energy to test quantum gravity, the experiment hole.\par So currently our best bet for testing our those natural experiments that have happened that by using gravitational wave astronomy \par very first light in the universe, released the entire sky. But this light isn\rquote which you can see here. These little fluctuations from the big bang when the universe was smaller that is. It is literally Heisenberg\rquote sky. The large scale structures of the universe, seeded by quantum physics in the deep past.\par So this is a clear place where gravity and the cosmic microwave background in great detail, them in the right direction. But these patterns t know if our current measurements have the \par to our gravitational wave experiments. They a theory of quantum gravity then there should is a tiny little packet of gravity: a quantization \par seen by our current gravitational wave detectors job to just detect gravitational waves themselves, detect miniscule changes in that wave. This light waves, but very hard for us to detect \par be to detect a graviton. In fact they may to measure distances smaller than the Planck mechanics. So, instead astrophysicists are waves from black hole collisions in the hope relativity. And if there is, then it\rquote what direction to take with quantum gravity.\par Until we get some new evidence of a departure we\rquote ll never get closer to having a \par contenders for a theory of quantum gravity: I\rquote m not going to spend lots of time and very complicated and I don\rquote t really \par a field for each of the fundamental particles particles themselves are excitations of those is the curvature of space-time.\par Now string theory treats spacetime as another with the other forces in one framework, whereas the forces, it attempts to work out what the \par particles and their properties are the result strings that exist in an 11-dimensional space to the graviton. So it reduces all the particles which is a string. The theory has had some for not actually describing the real world. \par but attempts to model the quantum nature of the planck length, and it implies that there a space-time pixel.\par These are the most popular proposals for quantum to state that neither theory has an experimental something that isn\rquote t already covered \par What\rquote s the point of discovering a correct it have to the world?\par Well being able to understand black holes completely breaks down when spacetime becomes gravity would hopefully solve the many mysteries Are they the gateway to wormholes to other What happened to the quantum information of physics tells us is not able to be destroyed? before the big bang, and ultimately where \par it affect us directly?\par Truth is, I don\rquote t know, we would never into the history of science every single paradigm technologies. For example, understanding quantum and the whole information age. And to get sure that we\rquote ll have to abandon at So no doubt when we have a theory of quantum we can\rquote t even imagine right now.\par And most of all, for me, it would be cool works.\par This part of the video is sponsored by Brilliant to help you learn science and mathematics. the nitty gritty of the subjects I\rquote option if you would like to dig deeper and A couple of courses relevant to this video the fundamentals of Newtonian gravity, and quantum realm.
