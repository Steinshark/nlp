It's a cheap versus Let's talk about that. Good Mythical Morning. You know, but sometimes a quality investment will actually save you Unless that quality investment is just product that does the exact same thing. Yeah, why pay all that money for an actual buy a perfectly good hand carved Ron. He may be lonely, I don't know Ron. He's lonely and talented. Okay, so let us help you save by their expensive counterparts. It's time for The Power of the Price. Price. Price. Okay, today you're competing against each But what's more thrilling In front of you are two vacuum sealers. One is pricey, and the other is cheap. Go ahead and test them both. And then you're gonna tell me what Well, mine is smaller. I got a biggie. It's smaller. Yours has bag roll in it. Mine has bag stacked beside it. I thought, you were gonna say nothing's more Ooh, that's good. I have to seal the I do not. I have these, like, little pouches, but I only have one size. Now it's done. And I want to keep this so that when I eat it. Oh, it's sealed. Tomorrow. It hasn't touched more air than it needs to. Then. See? So, I've already caught up with you, And then I cut. Oh, that's so satisfying. And then all I do is I place this. Nothing's more thrilling Now, I can. I can pack luggage with this, too, right? Yeah. Hold on. You got your pizza? Yep. Got my pizza. I got my Jell-O. I'm just gonna hit on. It's cubed. I'm gonna hit dry. Oh, yes. That did it. I want a dry piece of pizza. Oh, my gosh. Look at the grease coming out of it. Look, look, look, look, Rhett, grease. Grease, grease. Oh, nothing's more thrilling Link. I knew that already. I just discovered a better way to get the grease off my paint supplies than to use the napkin dab. I'm gonna bring this Okay, watch me. Now. Yours sounds stronger. It's still mushy. Oh, it doesn't crush it, though. Yeah. It didn't crush it. No grease coming out. And then seal. I want you to look. I want you to look at what I've done. Now, hold up what you've done. Yeah. You look like an astronaut. I look like an astronaut? Yeah. Because I'm holding this next to me? Yeah. Hey, that's all it takes. You've never looked more like an astronaut. Trick or treat. What are you, little boy? I'm an astronaut. Oh, no. I didn't have to cut it. Yep. And now I'm gonna open this See how it tastes. Now, Link. That sucks. I did it wrong. Try again. Okay. I did it wrong. Dude. All right, so is that user error? Hold on. Nothing's more thrilling And then you close that and do like this. And then you vacuum. And then. But you didn't seal? I did seal. Okay, so now I seal. Seal. Seal! Sealed. Now I pull. You're sealed. Pull, and then cut. So now I. Pull. Pull. Keep pulling. You might as well just keep pulling. Let's see the seal. Yeah, I don't have to cut it again. I'm trying to cut. So, you've done it? I'm an astronaut. No, you're not. You're a doofus. I'm also an astronaut. And when you turn it upside down, does it not move? Is it that much sealed? But, listen, in space, it won't do that. All right, so, now. Yours definitely functioned It was easier. It was doofus proof. It was such a tight seal, Link. It left a nice pattern. I think the aggression of the I don't like the uncustomizable bags. There you go. You want to go to space with me? No, but you could probably do, like, a risque show south of the border. All right, what else am I going to. I don't even know what I don't have any idea. Say you want to preserve the hand of, that you've severed from, a human. I want to keep this hand nice and they can have all the You see how easy this is? I like the fact that yours is smaller. It's better for space. And I actually clamped his fingers. I don't think he feels it. So I sealed it. Now, like, for the serial killers out there, stuff would splurge out like, and just like the grease from the pizza. Oh, this is gonna be good. Yeah. This is gonna be thrilling. Listen, if you're a good boy, I'm gonna give you a So we can stay in space This should really be done by now. User error. All right, so now I've errored. I didn't go far enough. But we're still having a good time. Why, Link? Because thrilling is. Nope. Because nothing's more. Here we go. Nothing's more thrilling That's right. Okay, here we go. It doesn't. The hand's too big. Doesn't want to work. Vacuum. Look, look, look, look, look, look. Gotta move the. Look, look, look, Link. Link, look, look, look, Link. Mine's weak. Look, look, look. Look, look, look. Hey, hey. Oh, Oh, my God. You gotta warn somebody. Okay. Cotton fingers. And then I seal. That's why I killed him, sir. He had cotton fingers. Seal. Oh, he's just got cotton for fingers. Well, you're. You're. You're free to go. There we go. Now. Killing people. Hey, hey, check that out. Catch it. Blocked. So were you trying to catch it? Just let it come to you. Rejected. Okay. Well, but I guess I'll just do it myself. All right, I will give it one more try. It went right in the trash. Right in the trash. You like magic? Feel that. That one works very well. This could be a camp pillow/ And also s'mores. That's right. You sleep on it one day, Is this? Come on, now. Come on. I need results. I want to be thrilled. Okay, so we need to be ready to vote. This one didn't work. So it's kind of hit or miss. Have some marshmallow there. I'm sure it's wrong. You won't get marshmallows. You just get. I did something wrong. That's a clean hole. But there's nothing in there to suck I just wanted you to taste the air. All right, so how are we gonna vote? We're gonna hand over? Yeah. Hand over the one you In three, two, one. The bigger, shinier one. It's bigger. It's got more materials. Shinier. You are both correct. Okay. So the cheaper one on Link's side is How much do you think the Twenty-nine ninety-nine. Okay. Got it. I don't think there's I thought forty-seven ninety-nine. Eighty-nine ninety-nine. Two hundred and twenty This is the Food Saver vacuum sealer, food vacuum sealer. Also, Can you name those settings? Vacuum seal. No. Dry, moist, pulse and marinate. Yeah, something like that. I guess the pulse is for delicate foods, Dry, moist settings ensure an airtight the type of food you're sealing. But is it worth the money? Hold on. What is this? I think that might be the marinade. You put marinade in there, We're too unfamiliar with I don't think it's worth I'm saying no, because they both equally Can you get bigger bags for that one? Sure. I don't know. I think if you're a if you really get a thrill then I think you might think And I don't even know what this one does, Ooh, boy. So let's say I'll go with you on this one, Link. Thank you. I feel unequipped. Vacuum sealers. No dice. Next up, we have drills, because nothing's more thrilling. Yeah! Than drilling. Power drilling! Power drilling. Okay, bring in the wood at first. Now, mine doesn't have a big But that's kind of cool, is it not? And it says twelve volt. And mine says twenty-one volts. But are we paying for volts here? We don't know. Mine feels. Mine's a brushless motor. Is yours brush? I do not see a brush. I'm just gonna see how quickly with this Three, two, one. All right, I'm down. It seemed like it took you longer. Well, but does that? I mean. You have a smaller. Yeah, but, is it bigger? I don't know if that goes fast or slow. I don't know if that. I put in a bigger bit, buddy. Because I'm about to drill Can you give me a big bit? Oh, there's a big bit. Bigger bit. What is gonna happen to this? Maybe I'll put that there. I'll put it against that. Three, two, one. Yours is so fast. I thought that some rubber but they didn't. You know how often you need to? Some sort of a. You need to drill your. Nipple buffer. Drill your rubber ball. Let me go in reverse this time so I Oh. Oh, there we go. Speed two. Speed two? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think you got two speeds. You were already on two. That's why mine was going so slow. Because I was on one. Now let's. Bumping balls. You ever seen two boys Two boys bumping balls. I broke your bit. You got too carried away. Your bit came out. That's. That's the comedy we were looking for. The, the comedy or the &quot;cumb-idy&quot;? What did you say? The &quot;cumb-idy&quot;. That's the &quot;cumb-idy&quot; we were looking for. All right, so now. Welcome to the &quot;cumb-idy&quot; show. We need to do a little bit of. Well, just for. Just so you know. Oh, yeah? We were going to drill into but we decided to keep it completely Right. But what we do have is we've got wants to get his ears pierced. Yeah. Can we bring him in the middle? And you do the left ear. I do the right ear. Three, two, one. Pretty easy. Pretty easy. But I. I just went through his head. Yeah, I went pretty deep. I probably. I think we need to go Oh, so you could go through? Yeah, because we. We actually have earrings here. Okay, I'm through. Is that? It's not really how I wanted it to work. Look at that. I actually gave him a little Okay. All right. You want something? I'm gonna need a big one. Yeah, let's just each take a biggie. I can't see when your hand's in the way. Hey, this is. This is pure comedy. All right, so now. Just pure, unadulterated comedy. It's a comedy show. Where's the hole? I'm basically in. Yeah, but that worked. It's like, Saw. What are you doing, dude? Oh, that's horrible to watch. How about that? Oh, you need a little eye help? Look at his eyelid. Can he breathe? You gotta stay awake for this procedure. Can he taste? Oh, God. Can he smell? Can he smell? Okay. He can now. All right, so what have we learned? Well, yours has a lot more volts. It does, Link. Mine has this little battery. It's just such a little battery. But it's very hefty the I mean. I think it would be because it's smaller. All right. Hand over the more expensive one. Three, two, one. Yes. We're dads. We know. Brushless motor. More than voltage. This thing has less voltage, You are both correct again. Yes. Dad's for the win. The cheaper drill on Rhett's side is twenty-nine ninety-nine from Garden Joy. So how much is the expensive one? It's a brushless twelve volt. Impact driver. That's one where when you start drilling, like a hammer to get it to go in. Yeah, never will be. One twenty-nine ninety-nine. I'm still going cheaper. Seventy-four dollars Two hundred and twenty-nine dollars. I've done it again. Bosch. I would tell you some facts about it, but I don't understand ninety percent But do you think it's worth it? Do you think that extra two hundred I want to tell you right now. If you're not a pro, no. You're wrong. Here's why. I recently bought a drill, but. I have a cheap, crappy one. I went to the hardware store, I'm not a pro. I got the cheapest one. I hardly ever drill. You know me. Yeah. One year later. The thrill. Dead. Completely dead. Doesn't work. It was. It's not the battery. It's the. It actually is trying to send power to it, What? I don't know. And so I actually went and I was like, And I got to, like, a mid range one. So I actually think that it's not going to get to the job, and you're going to end You're going to get frustrated. You're going to start drilling. It is nice. It is nice. I'll give it to you. Drills, worth the price. Introducing the latest and greatest the Rhett and Link action figures. Look at this. I love the fact that The little boy me from the past Yes. In fully poseable form.
