[army shouting] [Narrator] Normandy. 1204 A.D. For two years, the English-occupied fortress has withstood the battering rams and tunneling efforts of It was a stalemate, one that might have were it not for an otherwise French foot soldier [Bogis] Bonjour! [Narrator] named One bloody day as the Bogis scanned the and saw what no one else did. A weak point ready By some accounts, it was located inside the added at the specific request Regardless of origin, The only one Bogis needed Once in, he hauled up dozens Chaos ensued. English defenders scattered. The siege was over. [crowd cheering] Thousands of tons of stone, the latest in and yet no one had thought And so the vulnerability until the moment when and crawled his Today's fortresses are They guard information, But they still architectural flaws And just like in 1204, the hackers, spies, cyber criminals, are searching for undiscovered So what do you do if for protecting data centers and cloud systems relied on You do everything you can to wherever they may be. [ anthemic music ] When it's your job to keep you have to live and just like the attackers do, because the only way is to think like one. Remember Royal? He's in charge of Privacy, [Royal] How are you? [Director] Hey, Royal. [Royal] Good to see you. You're coming out of We are the central team of the Google products for the privacy of users, the security of Google [Narrator] Wait, That seems like a [Royal] Right. [laughs] [Narrator] But to make sure it's necessary. After all, people don't and cloud services. They use hundreds of and operating systems, all just as the internet's [Royal] They made a to open-source the and then ultimately with one another. That was a conscious decision You can place the improvements of people on this planet at to allow everyone to [Narrator] But this comes at a price. Today, a vulnerability in threatens every part [Alex] Let's say I wake up, I get my coffee. I open up my phone. This phone is made I click on a button The app is written I see a link, I click that link. It opens up my Something that to a normal that seems like it's nice there's actually a lot of [Royal] The safety of on finding a vulnerability in one of those computers, software packages, before they're abused. The open internet Google said &quot;We're to finding the hardest-to-find [ upbeat music ] [Narrator] Who's responsible Meet Parisa Tabriz. She oversees and in a former life, [Parisa] I think I identified I still am in spirit, but I also think of myself than a hacker. [ video game music ] [Narrator] Years of dealing exploits and vulnerabilities to guide a team that's always on the [ upbeat music ] [Parisa] Project Zero by looking at it and trying to rigorously, ruthlessly break it and then fix it and prevent problems from [Narrator] That's right. Project Zero is a team of hackers that makes by trying to hack it. Each success that would have threatened that rely on Google But to understand you have to understand the A zero-day vulnerability is a weak point that's been discovered but not by the people That means when the defenders will have They'll be surprised, exposed, scrambling, just like the English defenders [Tim] Zero-day vulnerabilities too cheap and too numerous. [Commander] There is [Tim] And we think someone about making them making them more expensive, making them less frequent. [Narrator] Zero-days have of all kinds, from surveilling to damaging physical to well, you remember Aurora. [Tim] The vulnerability was a bug in a Microsoft product. That is the kind of case in point that sometimes for Google might be [Narrator] This is Tim. [Director] Smiling [Tim] Ha! [laughs] Alright. Hi. [Narrator] Tim is the And at the age of [Tim] I was chatting and they're like &quot;Do you And I'm like, "What?" &quot;Do you want a cup holder?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Uh... okay.&quot; And then they and I was like, "Oh, that's really cool. How did you do that?&quot; And then they wouldn't tell me. [Narrator] Each has their own origin story, but they all have a [Parisa] So a great Project who loves security research and finding bugs and wanting to that nobody else knows exists. Sometimes people "How do you find a bug?" Or, "How do you do And at the end of the day, it's almost like "How do you make art?" [Narrator] To find inside connected you need the best-- a hacker [Natalie] My motto is &quot;Hack Everything.&quot; [Narrator] Meet Natalie. [Natalie] Hey. [Narrator] True to her motto, Natalie has hacked phones, webcams, arcade games, microwaves, selfie sticks-- [Natalie] I do have a crate of 50 dismantled selfie sticks. [Narrator] Keyboards, USB sticks, battery packs, fans, and Tamagotchis. [Natalie] I won't lie. I am an extremely big If you wanna hack there's a lot of [Narrator] And that's just At work, she looks for in the apps used by [Natalie] I've been in software for more And you start to get a feel for where What sort of stuff do while writing? And video processing is [Narrator] That's right. The apps we use family, friends, school and work were potentially home With little more than a hunch, Natalie went to work testing of various video chat apps [phone ringing] a lot. [Natalie] I would say one I tried or less worked. That's the nature of hacking Almost everything But the odd thing does. [Narrator] In this case, the odd thing led to a way to force someone's phone to start transmitting without them even knowing. Here's how the hack Natalie sends known as a packet to a target phone. A perfectly normal step But hidden in this packet along with the typical that the target software Most random extra data but this extra data, one of the thousands of acts like a key, tricking the target phone into answering the call without Vulnerability confirmed. Exploit executed. Hack completed. Five different video all had the vulnerability. Meaning if you're one of the billions of people it would've been possible and listen to you Fortunately, there was had ever been but just like with all of the implications for the safety of our connected world were [Natalie] There always is what might be a good is actually a bad day for users and might about security that shows things are less secure than we thought. [Narrator] As soon the various companies of changes got made, patches went out. The online world got [ ambient music ] But getting zero-days hasn't always been so easy. [dial up modem beeps] Back in the 90s, members of the hacker would look for vulnerabilities then do whatever it took even talk to Congress. [Sen. Fred Thompson] The as rock stars of the We appreciate your being Within 30 minutes, the seven of you could for the entire nation. Is that correct? [Mudge] That's correct. And until the and enough people then they'll come out [Tim] It was fairly common if you report a bug to them, some of them took more than Some of them were just, They just went [ ambient music ] So when Project Zero from our own research, we report it to the company. &quot;That's day zero. This is the vulnerability. This is where we think it is.&quot; Sometimes even ,&quot;This is how And that's when we'll If the company doesn't then on day 90, we [Narrator] By online, he means on the And while this kind of the prospect of having an to the whole world is [Tim] Companies would They would prefer that we and not talk about The real core is that users lose when things [ ominous music ] In December 2018, Google's Threat Analysis had discovered a that were being used against a popular mobile device. They came over to Project We were able to reverse out the vulnerabilities. The implant in there allowed photos, GPS locations, you name it-- it was capable of doing it. We reported those issues to that makes that device, I believe, pushed out a [Narrator] More troubling, was that Project Zero's analysis had been in use for [Tim] The exploits went back many generations of this particular This had been happening [Narrator] The exploits were of the Uyghur community, [Tim] Seeing a capability against a population, it's like a stark reminder of what we're doing And it's not just playing around with code or dealing or company politics when and to and fros. There are real people getting And it's important that [city sounds] [ soft music ] [Narrator] The to surveil the Uyghurs but it was just one of many. To date, Project Zero has found over 1,800 in everything from operating to Google's own That's 1,800 trap doors that will never be 1,800 fortresses that have But every day new apps are launched and the internet gets a little more and a little more vulnerable. [Tim] Is my job getting Well I hope so, because otherwise we're [Natalie] We could these financial attackers, credit card thieves that didn't work anymore." And that was because I think everyone I think that vulnerabilities and security both financially and And I think it's important that everyone is in a way that doesn't [Tim] Is there an end I would like to it's incredibly hard to Will we get there Probably not. But does that mean we Absolutely not. [Narrator] So Project Zero inspecting the walls, trying to find and test so they can never [Parisa] You have hackers to harm other people and profit. And I usually call and you have a lot of hackers who do their work to make software and And I call those folks... heroes.
