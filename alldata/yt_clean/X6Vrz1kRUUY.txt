I actually found about this man who did so much to help the North tracked down someone who spent a lot of time with Olukoya Abisoye. In fact those clips you heard come from an interview Olukoya recorded with [Olukoya Abisoye] OK, my name is Olukoya Abisoye, Social media influencer, creative. I have a beard gear company, and I have a So yeah, that's what I do, I'm crazy!

And we say that a Nigerian lot of bullies, so, you know, I had to grow a thick [GW] These guys generate plenty of headlines for Nigeria's TV and newspapers, and Hushpuppi whirlwind of gossip, backbiting and one-upmanship [JL] So when Olukoya first gets a message of praise from Hushpuppi on Instagram, [OA] I'm like bro, I love what you do too! dress like that! That's why I'm asking, what in my influencer job to make some money myself. [GW] So obviously he's got a lot of money. Did he tell you where that money was coming from what [OA] Um, so to be really honest, I didn't know. I didn't know exactly what he did. I knew you know? But it's Dubai! Everybody there is rich!

[Nedim Medunjanin] We were in charge of guest needs. People liked to rent Lamborghinis, lot of people with a lot of money. Yeah. [GW] He called was he sort of known as Hushpuppi? [NM] He was, yes. If you see him for the first time, you would never what he did actually. He was so, like, an ordinary at the hotel lobby. He was just a normal, like As far as I know, he never ever tipped any [GW] Oh, really? [NM] One penny. And they did a lot of things for him, like [GW] So did that affect how people felt about him [NM] Not really, because he was always nice to everyone, he was always friendly and, you a couple of minutes. Before I knew who he really capable of doing what he did. It's just ridiculous, [JL] After arresting Big Boss in Atlanta, it to amass enough evidence on Hushpuppi figuring out his location, because he was authorities in Dubai to keep a close watch on and in June 2020, Dubai Police make their move. [NM] I remember the day, and a close friend of mine, he used to work as a security there, and he opened when the police came. [GW] No way! [NM] And then the police in the air!' It was... it was really like [GW] So much like a movie in fact, that Dubai Police Operation FoxHunt 2.

[GW] His downfall even inspires Voices Banor called They Will Catch You. [Music: Voices Banor, They Will Catch You] [GW] As for Olukoya, he's got conflicted feelings now about the social media career. [OA] I think if he's really guilty police do what they think is right. But I didn't bad person. I just saw a guy who liked what I he had done. I'm just saying that I didn't know [GW] This is one of the things I find interesting about Hushpuppi as a character, you're wearing these amazing clothes, having this of his life that he kept secret from you, he kept it's amazing that... that you can run those two [OA] That's very easy though. It's very easy because yeah understand that. I could tell you that I have a to rob a bank. The truth is, you wouldn't know. You home you do some other stuff. How would you know?

Hushpuppi pleads guilty to conspiring to engage in money [GW] Big Boss, aka Ghaleb Alaumari, also pleads guilty. multiple offences including laundering [JL] US authorities now have two of North Korea's real big bosses, the Lazarus Group? Well, remember unveiling the charges against Ghaleb? His case [Clip] These actors are not as anonymous as they think can see photos of the hackers at issue. You think [JL] It's February 2021.

They charge the heist, Wannacry, and add new allegations about attacks. North Korea, of course, continues to deny the FBI release wanted posters of the two we want to focus on, because authorities suggest and Bank of Valletta raids, and through him, Hushpuppi. [JL] I'm looking at his picture, it might be a passport photo. So he's wearing a blue shirt and a and a little smirk on his face. I think he wouldn't US authorities claim Kim was born in 1994. That at the time of the Cosmos attack. But according to whizz has already lived an extraordinary life, [GW] The authorities say Kim Il has lived in Russia and Singapore. Like Park regime. They also say he speaks Chinese and English, accomplices on the Dark Web. [JL] Despite the staggering three alleged hackers, there's almost no prospect to be back in North Korea. [John Demers clip] I expect they won't be would, so we could prove all these charges in [JL] Still, John Demers makes clear that the charges are intended to raise awareness of their targeting Lazarus Group activities by bringing [Clip] Good afternoon, my name is Jesse Baker that's Secret Service here today.

In fact, he managed to find [Mike DeBolt] So there was two or three aliases that we saw and he was reportedly arrested in October 2019. [JL] So we asked Mike if he thinks the group will have a hard time replacing Big Boss. [MD] That's an interesting question. for sort of countering cybercrime is putting we do, but there's always going to be somebody provides. It's kind of a dime or a dozen, really, Korean actors to sort of replicate what they've to do it, it would be a little bit of a heartache, more so than it is a severe decapitation of [GW] In other words, the Lazarus Group is still on the march. their top hackers get unmasked and indicted, but the tens of millions of dollars. They can manage [JL] And that's because he never really was the 'big boss'. The Lazarus boss: Kim Jong-un.
