[Darren] There were things going on in that the community certainly didn't know. [Suspenseful music] [Leslie] A beautiful family, an elite education, It all sounds like he had it all, but in 1976, William Bradford [Darren] The anger that he showed is beyond even comprehension. [Music continues] [Leslie] He murdered his mother, and then vanished never to be found. [Music continues] I'm Leslie Ackerson. [John] And I'm John North. This is Appalachian Unsolved The Podcast. [Music continues] [Leslie] Our story starts in Maryland, where a man named William Bradford And to outsiders, his neighbors, his co-workers, he was brilliant, he was hard-working, and he had a pretty impressive resume. [John] Leslie, by all appearances, This should be a story about somebody somebody who had three great-looking children, a wonderful wife who was an artist, a mom who looked after him and loved the family, clearly was an up-and-comer. I mean, he had so much going for him, so much that you would think this I mean, a Yale education alone would have been something one could Somebody who had great promise but as we know, that's not at [Darren] He was fluent in five languages. He was very narcissistic. And we don't look at him as the kind but he certainly probably considered himself that. [Leslie] John, you and I traveled to Washington where this all happened and talked 44 years later, he and his team because it's well-known in the community. When was the first time you ever heard [Darren] I first heard the name William Bradford Bishop, So I was 14. I had some friends that lived, literally, [John] He remembered it as a kid long And from the moment, basically, it's something that he thought about, If the people who came before him And he's still trying to do that to this day. [Leslie] And you mentioned the family, John. He had a lovely wife, his high His mother, Lobelia, lived with them in the home. And then their three boys, there They were 5, 10, and 14 years old. [John] He was very affectionate and close to all of them. I think the oldest boy that... he nicknamed Pino, wherever [Darren] They seemed to be very happy. They would go to the beach. They'd go skiing. The neighbors never thought anything else [Suspenseful music] And the homicides came to...really as a shock. [Leslie] We went by the home as well that they lived. A very nice neighborhood, somewhere that [John] If you can imagine back in the mid-'70s, it would have been kind of the perfect place to raise your family. Easy drive into Washington if you great location, good schools. It was a nice place to live. You know, the house was kind of tucked You kind of had to walk up the drive to get to it. But it was a nice place. It would have been a great place to come home to. [Suspenseful music] [Darren] On the outside, the and any other people that they ran into they portrayed this perfect family, but He insisted on having family dinners. He insisted on that they would all be there. He insisted on that if he was speaking... It was actually very tense at those [John] This strikes me as a story where who was in turmoil, who was dealing with somebody who tried to do the best he could, he tried to meet all the expectations and yet there may have been some kind [Leslie] Bishop enjoyed this very controlled, We actually got a chance to read [John] That we know of, this is the only insight we've really got into what may It's not a lot. It does offer us something. There's one passage, in particular, It would have been written in 1967. It was recovered after the crime. Almost 10 years before he did what he did. But I'll just read a little bit about it, and it almost sounds like he's &quot;I am getting better,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I am on the threshold.&quot; &quot;I recognize now that to twist my accursed confines,&quot; &quot;I must develop a continuing and constant sense of &quot;This is my greatest challenge.&quot; &quot;For this has always been the great impediment &quot;to burst the bounds.&quot; Who knows exactly what that means but it sure sounds like he's saying, &quot;I wish I could just be me.&quot; [Leslie] As the years progressed, his cursive And he kind of changed personality. He became more intense. He became more self-absorbed. And people started to notice that [Darren] There was quite a bit of about how him not being successful, about him not making it to the [John] I think he also became more secretive. So he was clearly doing things he For example, it looks like, based on what you he may have been having an affair on the side. It sounds like during his travels, that during one trip over to Europe, before All of that is not very smart if because it's a high-profile job and the State They pay very close attention to what you're doing. And he was playing a dangerous game. But he'd always kind of been like that. He'd always sort of lived on the edge. [Darren] He wanted to portray this family and actually, they were running out of money. [Suspenseful music] Mrs. Bishop wanted to go back to work. He did not want her to. He wanted her to be a stay-at-home mom and And so there was definitely some disagreement and some hostility between Mr. Bishop and his wife. And whether that led to a point in his life that everything was going to come crashing down, that it wasn't as perfect as he was portraying to you know, until we get Mr. Bishop But that appears to be the only motive that we can even kind of go down that road that his life was falling apart. Now, they certainly, you know, don't get how anybody could ever do some just horrific act like this. [Suspenseful music fades] [Leslie] So let's go to the day of the crime, March 1, 1976. William Bradford Bishop goes to work. [Darren] Bishop was at work that day. According to his coworkers, He had recently learned that he was not promoted and told his supervisor he was not [John] That was a lie. We don't know this, but we can surmise it. By this point, he already had murder on his mind [Leslie] On the way home, he makes a couple of stops, and these are really important to what follows next. First, he goes and gets some [John] He gets cash, $400, which would have been And he stops at two other places. And I'm sorry to say, he's getting the instruments He buys a hammer, and at another place, he stops and he buys And as we learn, these are the [Leslie] He fills up the family station wagon, [John] When he got back to And he comes into the house and his wife, I think we learned, was on the floor, maybe doing something, reading, Investigators tell us it sounds like she was first to die. [Darren] He took the hammer that he had bought and beat her over the head and killed her [John] He wanted to make sure And then sadly, as horrific as it sounds, [Darren] The boys were already in their pajamas. They were all in bed. He went room by room and We know, based on the medical examiner's report, when he was actually taking the hammer to them, that he was hitting them so hard that the blood was actually reverberating or being thrown The blood pattern will show you that It was then he killed his own mother The anger that he showed when he committed these murders [Suspenseful music] [Leslie] He then loads the bodies. He doesn't leave them. He loads him in the back of the car that and grabs those tools that he'd picked up. He takes the family dog with and he leaves town in the middle of the night. As you mentioned earlier, John, It's a little bit of a long driveway. There are some trees and some bushes, wouldn't be easy for neighbors to really unless they were really looking for it. [John] Though, neighbors have, They were pretty close, but they didn't hear anything. No suspicions were raised. And yeah, as you say, in he loads up, unfortunately, these bodies in We can only wonder what the dog is thinking, They know something. When something horrific happens, You have to wonder what the dog was experiencing. He heads down south to North Carolina, to It's not a place that's like just off the interstate. It's a remote place. It had to be where he thought if he was [Darren] Early that morning, he finds a logging road. And when I say this is a logging road, If you were to go down there, and and even to this day, it's not on a map. This is not a road that unless you were familiar you never would have known it was there. This is not something where he &quot;Hey, that looks pretty rural, looks pretty wooded.&quot; &quot; &quot;Let me drive down there and let me check out.&quot; &quot;Maybe I'll just bury the bodies there.&quot; He had to have been there before. There was no way you could have found that road. [John] This place is so remote that it's the It's that small. If you remember where the Wright Brothers it's not too far from there. It is a place where you just have to know where And if this was, I think I remember that was and he drove off into the [Leslie] And that's when he creates a grave to dispose of what he's done. [Darren] He gets down the road, takes out his shovel, but it was a shallow grave but it was deep [John] It looks like he tried to dig He dug a pit, but, I mean, it's not easy to Probably, we know he didn't and then he decided to set them on fire. [Darren] There was a park ranger, who was saw the smoke coming up from that particular He gets some emergency folks The fire, by the time he got there, it it had spread to about a three to four acre area. So the fire had spread. He, actually, then saw this of three young children and two women who but they were burned badly. And that's when the North Carolina [John] One thing that stuck out in my mind was I think the ranger later told authorities because the fire was that fresh. It was not far off the road. And it just felt like it was still going. And for a fire like that to still be that fresh, it had to have been just minutes since Bishop had set it and then [Suspenseful music] [Leslie] The ranger notices a woman's leg, and then they would call in and find the three children and the two adult women. [John] How macabre is this site? You're out in the middle of nowhere and you come across a fire and you look more closely and it's the remains of let's see, one, two, three... No, there are more than three bodies in there. There are a total of five. Some of them you can sort of tell, a woman's leg, but most of them it's like, what is this? There was no identification on any of these people. There was no way to identify who they were. [Leslie] Bishop is brilliant as he was as He left some important stuff behind. He left his tools that we talked Mr. Bishop left the gas can [Darren] There was a small sticker on here in Montgomery County, Maryland The investigators from North Carolina came up here to try to figure out who these people were. [John] You have to wonder if if he had grabbed the hammer up, if he had taken those things with him and driven off, that would have earned him even more time. But yeah, the tools themselves were the best clues that the authorities had to figure and where these folks might have come from. Other than that, there was nothing that would readily say, &quot;Oh, these people just came from Washington, DC.&quot; [Leslie] While authorities are out there in North Carolina trying to figure out how these bodies He's got a head start, and he's So he's on the road driving. Authorities are trying to figure out what's Back at home, neighbors are getting worried. It's been a few days. It's March 8, and they're noticing they [Darren] Some neighbors were starting to get concerned. There was newspapers piling up in front of the home. [John] Mrs. Bishop had a Volkswagen Beetle that had been sitting in the garage...I'm sorry... sitting in the driveway untouched Neighbors noticed that. They noticed that there had been and they got concerned and [Darren] They called 9-1-1. Officer goes to do a check. Didn't take more than a step to get inside the front door to see that something horrific had occurred. [Suspenseful music] [Leslie] We've seen the crime scene photos, John. Bishop didn't exactly clean up the house when he left. The evidence of that gruesome Even though there weren't any [John] Yeah, just walking through those that's all you needed to know to understand that something And imagine how the police must have thought when they walked into the bedrooms and thought, &quot;All right, there clearly have been homicides here.&quot; &quot;Where are the bodies?&quot; [Leslie] So police in Maryland think six family members They're including Bishop in this right Meanwhile back in North Carolina, authorities Let's talk a little bit about communication back in 1976. Phone lines, emails, faxes. It took a lot longer to make connections of, &quot;We've got missing people.&quot; &quot;Here's five bodies in North Carolina.&quot; [John] If you had the discovery of five bodies in a grave, it would be slow to get out. The way it would get out to the rest The Associated Press wire, for example, or UPI. It wouldn't be something that would two hours after they were discovered. It would take time, and it would be considered So people would have assumed, &quot;Oh, who are five people from North Carolina, We just didn't have the instantaneous idea of It was a slower time. It may have made the evening news around North Carolina and the biggest cities that day after the discovery. I kind of doubt it made the Washington DC news. It took a while for it to filter out. [Darren] Once the word got out we were able to put together were the Bishop family from [Leslie] That little tiny clue of that sticker on the shovel finally helped them fit the pieces together. And they realize, &quot;We only have five bodies in this pit.&quot; &quot;Someone's missing.&quot; [John] Yes, somebody was definitely And I am sure...I think it's safe to say at that point, they had a very good idea of what was going on. But, unfortunately, they still didn't know where he was, and they had to put together, by that point, One was sitting in the driveway at home in Potomac. Where was the station wagon? [Leslie] Brad Bishop was indicted for the five homicides and that's when the race began to find where he had gone. We already said he had a head start. So our next sighting would come 500 [Darren] It was 17 days later that was a confirmed lead. The station wagon that Mr. Bishop was driving was located in the Great Smoky Mountains in Elkmont park. [Suspenseful music] [Leslie] A national park ranger 17 days after the killings parked at Elkmont. John, tell us a little bit about what for people who aren't as familiar about that area. It covers a lot of ground. There are a lot of great hiding spaces. [John] The park itself is, you know, 520,000 acres. So there are lots of different places And a lot of people do come or they make the decision they're and we also have people who go Fascinating that he chose Elkmont. Elkmont is a very unique part of the park. It's an old...it's now...nobody lives there anymore, but it's an old community where mostly used to go often from Knoxville to They could build their own cabins and often they did. You lived in a little community up there. You had your own place. You have to wonder how he knew about That's where he went, and that's where [Leslie] Investigators would look into that station wagon. They'd find blood, a shaving kit, and dog treats. But no Bishop. He was not with the car. [John] No Bishop, no idea where he Some suspicions. Maybe some ideas that he was going in another [Darren] Once he walked away from [Suspenseful music] [Leslie] That's not where the story ends. Brad Bishop is an internationally sought fugitive. Today, he'd be 83, and he once graced the FBI's top 10 most wanted list. Part two comes next. [John] Federal authorities are still assuming And so far as we know, he may very well be. [Darren] He potentially could be in a cabin because I don't discount anything. [John] Next, we explore where he may have gone, who may have seen him, and what may be happening to him today.
