Getting offended Yeah, and 3. Fighting Oh no! For our returning Running Gag Copycat Awards, here are the first four entries! First one please! ENTRY No.1 Too much oomph in the intro of "Under's Love" Here we go. Here comes Riria. ~ (Straining) Oh, no. Not again. What a baddie. Right. Brutal. Yeah. You are easy prey, Riria. Always the target. I love the last part! (Straining) I'm surprised you caught that. Let's continue. Next one, please! ENTRY No.2 Passing a hand through luscious locks Let's go. Lol ~ Is that dance move even in the song? ~ There it is! It's Nagano. That was great! I love it! Yeah! This is great! It's Nagano. That was awesome. Is that part of the choreography? No, it is not! But Nagi always overdoes it. Because of her long hair? The last part is so Nagano. I wanna see Nagi doing it. Let's keep it rolling. Next one, please! ENTRY No.3 Using too much force in "Jikochu de Ikou!" Yakubo? ~ I didn't see that coming! I see now. Aren't they all different? What's the correct pose? Boo~! Like that? Ah, I see. Like this. I'm not like that! Well, the fact that everyone is laughing means you're doing it. A little bit. Let's go to the next one. Who's the next one? ENTRY No.4 Mio Yakubo liking Sakura and the color pink Again? Sakura! Looks cute in the picture! Sounds like her. Ah! Pink! So cute! It's the real Sakura! Good morning, Sakura! You're cute today as usual! Ah! Sakura's wallet is pink too? How cuuute! Every part's cute! Pink-chan! Pink-chan! Saku-chan! Cuuuuute~! Well done. Great! Sounds just like her! Agreed! You also like pink, huh? I love pink. I can imagine. Yeah. Now then. Ume did the first one. Riria Ito's. Such a baddie. As usual. Yes. Ume's bit last year is seared into our memory. That signature pose of Riria Ito. Right. That's the fan favorite. It is. I apologize for the delay. I was not waiting! This is the newest one. We performed this song every performance during this National Tour. I think everyone noticed it. Oh, really? You all noticed? I'm putting in all my might, so I can't deny I'm doing it. I see. She always is possessed by him during a concert. You're from Okinawa, right? Yes. There it is. He's from there. You got the same spirit. Maybe a little of him is in my mind. I see, a little bit. That's not Okinawan style though. It's not. Passion in your heart. She's got some chest move. And her face is like a Shisa lion. Scary. Are you bad-mouthing? Of course not! Guardian lions. Little gods. Yes. One comes down on her. A god, yeah? Yes, yes. Alright. I'm curious how much she does it. Can you show us? Now then, here's how Riria does it! ~ So this is too much? Is this strong? No! She's being modest. She does it way harder in the show. Not like that? No. And her face didn't change much. She didn't turn into a Shisa. Stop! Stop it! They don't look alike! Mean! Her Shisaness is a great addition. What are you talking about! Shisa is a necessity, huh? Most definitely. Next is... Inoue. Ogawa did Inoue becoming like Nagano. Is it true? Yes. Is that so? She fills a pause with Nagano. Combing hair like him? No way! Well you got the long hair. I love the last part. Yeah the last part is totally Nagano. Is that true? It looks like that to you? Looks like it. Interesting. Inoue! I don't think so. No, you are just not aware of it. Show us. Are you serious? Just do it as usual. Let's see if she really does the Nagano move! ~ Ah, this part. ~ Ah! You're doing it! Does everyone do the hair thing there? Wait, they do, right? Kubo? The hair queen? No! Are you doing your hair like that? I do but subtly. I don't go all around. That's Nagano's way of doing it. Completely different. So Nagano comes out randomly? No? It's okay but I want you to push it to this point. Yeah. That way it's more Nagano-esque. After that, you gotta go like this. I want you to go as far as &quot;Lassen ga!&quot;. &quot;Lassen ga!&quot; Shall we change the tune? Then Wada. Doing Yakubo's bit. I noticed it during a national tour. Is that real? She was dancing like this with wonderful energy. And all of a sudden... Whaaat?! How scary! You oughta do it like this, right? Yes. There. Should be here, but by momentum, Yes. Like this. Out! It's like booing. Boo~! She did it with a huge smile on her face, which was shocking. Yakubo. I didn't know I was doing that! Unconscious? Yes. Kaki. You were great! This was also Yakubo's impression. The voice was alike. Oh really? The motions too. Thank you! Sure. You like the color pink, Yakubo? She calls the color pink "Pink-chan". I do? Wow. Saku-chan and Pink-chan? Yes. If she wears a pink costume, she says "Looky! I'm Pink-chan today~!" Wow. She says that? I see. Sakura (cherry blossom) is pink. Ah. That's why. That's why you like Saku-chan. It's not just about the color. Oh yeah? She scares me for some reason. Boo~! Boo~! Running Gag Copycat Awards Next up are these four! First one please! ENTRY No.5 Haruka Kuromi drinks water like a man I'm thirsty. Water! The gaze looks similar. Does she really drink like that? Really? Manly the whole time. Y'all are laughing so it's true I guess. That's how you drink? Kuromi does have those eyes! Come to think of it. She had the same glaring eyes Just wow. Oh really? She looked scary when you Like a fighter? I love the pumped-up Kuromi though. Shall we continue? Let's see who's next! Let's go. ENTRY No.6 Teresa Ikeda acting like a criminal backstage on Can't wait. Gochisousamadeshita! Gochisousama! That was delicious! It was delicious! It's already 15:30. I'mma brush my teeth. Okay. Looks like Teresa a bit. Bye. Bye-bye~ Oh? Moving like a thief. Oh what is this camera! Ah, the bento boxes! How many are you taking? How many are you taking?! Oh boy. Not a scene you want imitated. She's running away! I see! That was good. The face angle was so Ikeda! I know! The way she talked was also similar. Yeah. The gaze too. Yup. I like how you use that security camera. Feels authentic. Right. Let's keep it coming. ENTRY No.7 Penguin on the move, Asuka Saito Oh, Asuka. Asuka, a little bit to the left. Ok. I can see her. Yeah. One step back. Ok. She'd do that! Everyone is doing it! Asuka, here's your favorite. Ok. Hey! You're overdoing it! That's some audacity. But I can see you doing it. I think I saw you moving like that. Like a penguin. The feeding was too much! Maybe she saw you being fed. Oh boy. Let's keep it going, huh? ENTRY No.8 Mizuki Yamashita puts too much enthusiasm Interesting. ~ Which part? ~ Is it really? That high? ~ I know Yamashita is always intense but... Yup. ~ Ouch. Kicking. I totally get it. She's fierce. Yeah. Always spirited. I loved it. But does she really kick that high? I know, right? Kuromi! That was good! That look in your eyes! The first act was good! Like... Your eyes just never meet. Like... Never?! Kuromi always does something like this, huh? She's always moving to a rhythm too. For real? Are you Wanderlei Silva? Like... Like you're readying for a fight! Yup. I was a bit scared in that hallway in Hokkaido. Really? I wanna see her like that so bad. Yeah, at the backstage entrance. She drinks water just like that. Snapping her wrist. This angle? She also crushes the bottle while drinking. Really? Yup. How do you feel, Kuromi? Ouch. One time Yuna told me... that she hates the bottle crushers. Really? It's not common, right? The next one is Ichinose. That bit was good! I don't see Ikeda often, but you looked just like her! The gaze, right? Like, the angle of her chin is... How do I put it? Like she's capturing something with her chin. And some bento to go? I care about the environment. No, that's fine. It'd go to waste. She's probably embarrassed for no reason. That's why she's being sneaky. I see. She comes out on top when it comes to sneakiness! She eats her second bento like this! Because it's embarrassing? You eat two bento boxes? I haven't done it recently! You can if you want! How many do you bring home? I haven't done it recently! Not recently? What's the maximum number? Four! Oh! Wow! This one was good! I learned something new about Ikeda. The next one was from Ume. Ume is also quite malicious. Your bit. Totally agree. I do it with respect. Asuka. I can imagine you moving like that though. Yeah me too. Seriously. Like this. No way! No, no. That's not true! That's mean! Don't look over here! Instead of 1 big step for short distances, she takes itty-bitty steps. Aaah! Good point. Her mouth is also a bit like a penguin. Like this. No way! Yeah you do. Wow. After all you're Asuka (Fei Niao ), That's mean! Didn't see that coming. You're the worst! Dissing Asuka! You know, the same species. I see. How many insults have you prepared? Shisa and all. No, no, no. Again, I do it with respect! For real! I hate you... And Iwamoto. She does that thing! Everybody was laughing! This may be the most obvious bit for the 3rd gen. Is she the only one doing that? She's probably too fired up. Yeah I noticed that. Right? Her eyes are like... "Let's do this thing!" Oh no! That's Kuromi! 3rd gen Kuromi, right? What do you mean?! The original Kuromi and the 3rd gen Kuromi. What...? Surpass the originals! Go beyond mere impressions! Exciting copycat contest! Next up is the 3rd block. First one please! ENTRY No.9 Sayaka Kakehashi trying to fix her hair Hmm... Is this okay? How do I look? Is my hair okay? You're fine. The show's about to start. Alright. Hey Saku! Lend me your eyes! How do I Iook? Am I alright? O...Of course. Her eyes are a mirror? Perfect! Nice one. I see. Is it real? You picked up on a nice point, Tamura. She really did. I'm learning new things about everyone. Alright, next. ENTRY No.10 Kaede Sato, becoming a robot (Like a robot) Commencing dental care procedure. Error, error! What a stupid robot. That's funny! What a meanie. Totally. So funny. The way she talked was similar! (Like a robot) " Commencing dental care procedure." Yeah! That reminds me of the photo of you spilling lunch. Aaah. You know? Yup. You must have said (like a robot) Let's continue, huh? Next one, please! ENTRY No.11 Haruka Kaki Thank you very much for today! Kaki, any comments? Yes. I'm happy with how far I've come. And uh The pinkie is the point, huh? Um It was really nice to meet you all. Look at those teeth. Yeah. I see. I can see her doing it. Totally! Wanna see it. Tamura. Yes. Kakehashi? Yes. Her bangs. She fixes her bangs before the stage. It gets a bit messy after rehearsals. So she grabs whoever's arm next to her, and begs to borrow someone's eyes. The eyes are like a mirror? I wonder how that works. Normally, you can't see yourself, so I open my eyes wide like this. You done it before? A few times. You act as a mirror, so to speak. There are quite a few members who have lent their eyes. Who has she asked before? Quite a few! I see. I wonder what eyes are best for that? Kanagawa, you too? I've lent her my eyes before. We were often together in the early days. She begged to borrow my eyes. "What do you mean, eyes?" I said. I feel ya. I was scared but lent her my eyes. I wonder, what if she's alone on some other random show? Right. What if only Akira Nakao was available? "Pardon me, sir. May I trouble you for the eyes?" "Surely." "Go ahead." "Even Shino has never asked me that." Ah his wife? Ume. You did it again, huh? Yes. Her way of brushing her teeth is really dynamic. Sticking out her elbows like this... Like this? Yup. It's like uh how we brushed when we were in preschool. Like this. She literally is a pre-schooler. Are you dissing her? Is that really how you brush your teeth? I feel like I need to scrub hard. That's why. With that intensity? I'm afraid I'd bleed out... brushing that hard. She got the inflection too. Yup. Thank you. But she used to be a lot more robot-like. I guess the human in her is back. Dissing is your forte, huh? She also knocked things over a lot on this year's tour. Again? Like that previous photo? Yes. Similar incident. After getting some catering? Yes. How'd you do it again? I turned Fukuoka over last year, and uh Oh, my. You did this to Fukuoka? "Don't mess with me!" "Shut your face!" "Let's turn Fukuoka upside down!" Did you turn Fukuoka upside down last year? That's why I decided to be more careful in Fukuoka. It depends on the location? Everything was fine in Fukuoka, though. But I forgot about it all. I made a mess at every location after that. All of them? You're kidding? That's funny. Yumiki. Yes. Yumiki was also a bit malicious. Showing teeth like that. That was malicious. Kakki always holds a mic like this. It's like she's about to play the recorder. She uses the tip of her hand to hold a mic. Ah, a recorder. Why don't you hold like this with your hands? Hmm I'm not sure. I guess the breathability is better this way. Breathability!? Because your hands are soaking wet? Ah, you're sweating. Maybe the recorder muscle memory is coming out. Unconsciously. Ah like the good ol' days? That's what I meant. Ah... "Ah the good ol' days?" "Ah the good ol' days?" Nice. Such a conversationalist you are. Funny. Wada's impression final! Into the realm of illusion! What's happening?! Who's next? Please begin! ENTRY No.12 Aya Ogawa turning into Oh Ogawa. ~ MJ? Wow what is this! Whoa! What is that?! How did she do that?! How did she do that?! What a surprise. What was that?! What was that?! What was that?! Yes. You were hooked to a rope, Wada. "Hadashi de Summer" was the first song Everyone is just looking sideways like this but Ogawa is tilting like this. Really? Like she's being pulled by the neck. It was like MJ was among us! Wow. How do you even notice that when performing? "MJ was among us" She was tilting like Michael Jackson? Yeah, she was tilting so much. Look at Little Kiyohara working his butt off. What is that? Just let go of her! (Laughing) Ogawa! Yes. Ogawa, do you remember? Hmm the thing is... I want to push my limits. Why though? You're pretty aggressive in other songs What a dynamo. She uses her hair too. I once thought she was facing backwards, What do you mean? "I thought you were facing back!" How funny. Then I saw her nose and I realized I was wrong! You think you can say anything That's how energetic she was. Then I saw her nose! Ah That's front!
