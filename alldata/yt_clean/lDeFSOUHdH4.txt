On Wednesday, January a man calling himself Roland T. Owen checked into the Hotel President in Kansas City in room 1046. Witnesses say he was aged with brown hair, a scar on his and a cauliflower ear. He was nicely dressed in a black coat. The bellboy, Randolph Propst where he reported that Owen a brush, comb, and toothpaste. The maid, Mary Soptic. (laughs) - [Shane] What's her name? - [Ryan] Oh God, I know what you're, she's a maid, her name - [Shane] I'm trying to move pa-- - What a really funny big Yeah look how happy you are! Oh man, what a gem of comedy The maid, Mary Soptic, to clean while he was in the room, but asked that she not lock because his friend was about Soptic said that Owen kept and the lights off with the Other staff members who entered the room also mentioned this detail. - I don't want to be in the room when they're in there, that's scary. - Yeah. - I imagine him just sitting in a chair in the corner just a shadow man. Clean it. Clean the room. - You, I think you're from this guy. - Fluff the pillow. (Ryan laughs) - [Ryan] According to the maid Soptic's statement to the police, &quot;either worried about End quote, and that quote &quot;he always wanted to kind End quote. At four p.m., Soptic finding Owen laying on the bed, completely dressed in the She also saw a note that read &quot;in 15 minutes, wait.&quot; End quote. It's weird right? - [Shane] Yeah, I would - [Ryan] If you were the maid? - [Shane] No. - Yeah I think that's a If you see a guy laying awake, just like looking at you I think that's your cue to leave. The next day on January 3, Soptic came back to clean the room at 10:30 a.m. She noticed that the door had and assumed that Owen locked However, Owen was sitting which meant that someone else had locked the door from outside the room. While Soptic was still in the room, Owen answered a phone call and said quote, &quot;no Don I don't want to eat. &quot;I'm not hungry, I just had breakfast.&quot; End quote, repeating quote End quote. - [Shane] What hotels allow you to lock a room from the outside? - [Ryan] This hotel did. - [Shane] It's weird, I would imagine you could just call the - I'm locked in my room. - [Ryan] It's just my that's locking him in the that he's sitting in - [Shane] Well if this guy's a weirdo to begin with, he's got weird friends. - [Ryan] Okay I guess that's fair. - [Shane] Weird attracts weird. - [Ryan] Soptic came back around four p.m. to deliver fresh towels. She heard two male voices When she knocked, she heard &quot;who is it?&quot; End quote. When she explained that the man said quote &quot;we don't need any.&quot; End quote, even though there were no towels left in the room. During the night, a woman would report hearing loud cursing on the same floor. Though there was apparently a party going on that night in room 1055. Now things begin to get very strange. The next morning on the hotel phone operator noticed that Owen's hotel room phone had without being in use. So, she sent the bellboy Despite the locked door Propst knocked a few times and &quot;come in, turn on the lights.&quot; End quote. However, the door was locked and no one was getting up to let him in. So after knocking &quot;put the phone back on assuming that Owen was drunk. Around 8:30 a.m. about the phone was still off the hook and another bellboy, Harold with the passkey using only the bellboy Pike observed that Owen was in bed, naked, and seemingly drunk. He also noticed that the bedding The phone stand was kicked and put the phone back in the receiver. - [Shane] They went in there on the bed with a dark, dark stains all around them and were like chill. Those are your sheets! - [Ryan] He's obviously making himself into a sundae, nothing to see here. - [Shane] Right! - [Ryan] Let's go back - [Shane] Don't just leave, stupid. - [Ryan] At approximately the phone was once again They sent the original bellboy Propst to resolve the situation. When he opened the door, he stumbled upon a truly horrific scene. Here's his statement to the police. Quote &quot;when I entered the &quot;two feet of the door &quot;holding his head in his hands. &quot;I noticed blood on his head. &quot;I then turned the light on. &quot;I looked around and &quot;on the bed, and in the bathroom. &quot;This frightened me, and I immediately &quot;left the room and went - [Shane] It seems like to be like let's make sure nothing horrible is happening here. (Ryan laughs) Oh, seems like it might be. We'll give it another hour. Then an hour later, okay yep-- - [Ryan] This murder's not ripe yet. It's not ripe yet for the plucking. - [Shane] Yeah. - [Ryan] Also the way they found him-- - [Shane] Imagining that - He said he was within on his knees and his elbows - Like? - No not like that! He's not taking glamor shots. Nice of you to come in. I'm dying. - Just blood? (laughs) - [Ryan] Owen was discovered He had been tied up with the cord around his neck, wrists, and ankles. It appeared he had been tortured. Blood had even gotten on the - [Shane] I'm a little so aghast that blood is on Of course blood's gonna get everywhere. If a person is beating - [Ryan] It's also just, it's a visceral thing to imagine that someone's getting beat so heavily that blood is spattering - Well yeah, well that's what happens. If you put your finger in a (laughs) - What okay wait a sec-- - There's blood on the ceiling. - [Ryan] He had been hit and his skull was fractured. He'd also been stabbed in His lung was punctured. There was bruising around his neck that could mean he was strangled. Remarkably, Owen was One of the detectives would ask Owen about anyone else who had been inside the room. Owen responded quote &quot;nobody&quot; end quote. Although he was hardly capable of talking and not fully conscious. He explained quote &quot;I fell - [Shane] Hell of a fall. (Ryan laughs) (laughing) So in this scenario, he rolls over into the bed, and then starts bouncing up and down so the blood splatter goes - [Shane] Yeah, and so hard that he hits the ceiling a few times and breaks all his bones. - [Ryan] And fractures his skull. You know I bounced my head off the bathtub and I thought I'd go for a - [Shane] Jesus Christ. And tied himself up somehow? (Ryan laughs) - [Ryan] After this brief exchange, he was completely unconscious According to a doctor, the had occurred six to seven hours prior to Owen being discovered. - [Shane] That's a long time to bleed. - [Ryan] That means that by the time, when they first went to go was first off the hook, he was already injured at that point. He was already bleeding out and still said come in, turn on the lights. Unless of course it wasn't him, it was Don waiting to do more murdering. Detectives found no weapon in the room, therefore removing Four fingerprints were potentially from a female. Owen would die after midnight on January fifth at the hospital. When Owen initially he mentioned he was from Los Angeles, but Los Angeles authorities any record of a Roland T. Owen, bringing into question whether that was the victim's real name. His body was placed for viewing at Melody Mcgilley Funeral Home. As the story spread, more and more people began reaching out to to see if their missing loved one could be Owen, to no avail. Next police focused on the mysterious Don that Owen referred to several Don was also conceivably that the maid heard Nevertheless, the police's Owen's upcoming burial was announced by the Journal-Post on March third to be in a potter's field. However, the Melody Mcgilley from an anonymous individual who said they would send the money necessary for providing Owen with a proper funeral. Somebody knows who he is and Here 'cause like he-- tough love kind of guy. - [Ryan] I suppose, there's two reasons why he would not give Love, or maybe he was Like maybe there was some - [Shane] You think this - [Ryan] It could have been. - Hoh. his funeral if he killed him? Or like and if it wasn't for the funeral, why wouldn't and be like yeah, that's fucking Jerry. - [Shane] Right, the plot thickens. - [Ryan] It does indeed. - [Shane] This is a thick-ass plot. - [Ryan] This one's thick. - This plot is thick as hell. - [Shane] Oh it's a juicy peach all right and I've got juice running down my chin. (Ryan laughs) - [Ryan] Sure enough, on March 23 money, bundled in a newspaper, was delivered to the funeral home from Funeral flowers were anonymously arranged with the Rock Flower that said quote &quot;love placed on Owen's grave. - [Shane] Yeah I'm just to people's funerals and - You should just say and a picture of yourself. Like that. - But then people are like why'd you do that? And I'd say eh, it's a funny joke and they'd say this is a funeral you know? (laughs) - [Ryan] Skipping forward in 1936, a friend of Ruby Ogletree found an American Weekly piece Upon looking at the magazine, Ruby would correctly who left Birmingham in 1934. Owen's actual name was Artemus Ogletree and he was only 17 years old. - [Shane] Sounds like a Harry Potter boy. - [Ryan] What? - [Shane] That sounds like Artemus Ogletree? I thought you were referring it sounds like the story of Harry Potter. - [Shane] No, things - [Ryan] Yeah I think he went - [Shane] Yeah he wasn't brutally That would be a rough end to that tale. - [Ryan] Ruby Ogletree, received three letters from However, these letters were and were typed, according to a sensational newspaper account of the murder case. This was especially suspicious because Artemus didn't know how to type. This article also reported was quote &quot;slangy and unfamiliar&quot; end quote to Ruby Ogletree. - [Shane] Is it weird back then that you could just pretend to be someone? - [Ryan] You could still do that today. - [Shane] Nah. - [Ryan] I bet you I could and say my name is Ricky Goldsworth. - [Shane] But then they're going to say do you have a credit card sir? - [Ryan] And I'll be like I'm just putting a, just a deposit-- - That's not gonna fly, they're going to put handcuffs on you right away. Where'd you grow up Ricky Goldsworth? - Oh I grew up down the road. - Where, no, what city? - Oh New York City. - You grew up in New York City? - This is happening in New York now. - What's your mother's - Lucy Goldsworth. - What's her maiden name? - Lucy Gold. (laughs) - See, crumbling. - Well I wouldn't stumble like that. I'd have a prepared response. - You'd be firing 'em off? - I'd be firing 'em off and I'd be like what's the fucking holdup? (laughs) I'm trying to check into a room and you're giving me Is this how you treat all your customers? - All right. - Who do you think you are? - That's fair, okay that's fair! - And I'd poke him in the chest like this. - At this point I'm giving You did it, you win. You win, Ricky. - [Ryan] After some time, it was revealed that Artemus Ogletree had also stayed at the St. Regis in Kansas City with another man, possibly Don. In the early 2000s, Dr. John Horner, the author of an exhaustive account of the murder case published by the Kansas City Public Library received an out of state The caller claimed to newspaper articles about in a deceased elderly person's belongings. According to the caller, there was something else in the box. Something else that had apparently been referenced in the newspaper articles. Unfortunately, the caller did After that, the case would and would disappear into obscurity. And with that, let's The first theory is rather simple, that the man referred to as Don beat Artemus Ogletree to death As mentioned before, it came to light that shortly before his death, Ogletree had stayed in a different Kansas City hotel with Don was also conceivably that the maid heard but even if this theory is true, the police were never able to figure out who Don actually was. The second theory is that the This theory relates to an the elevator operator His observation also onto who Don could be. The night of the murder, &quot;commercial woman&quot; end quote, The elevator operator was 135 pounds, and about 5 1/2 feet tall. She had dark hair and was wearing a quote &quot;coat of Black Hudson seal end quote. - [Shane] What is the commercial, - [Ryan] She looks like she was dressed in very nice clothing, so they - [Shane] What? - [Ryan] Anyways, I that's what they called her. - [Shane] She looked - [Ryan] Yeah sure, with the Brawny guy. - [Shane] She was next to a big, tall bald man in a white t-shirt. - [Ryan] Yeah it was her, They all went and they just Blocher claimed this woman was looking for room 1026 to meet a It's possible that this woman and had mistaken room 1046 for 1026. This commercial woman was also seen with a man from the ninth floor, a man that the elevator operator said was the same height and Some speculate that this If you'll recall, there were fingerprints potentially from a female and a woman staying next door in room 1048 reported hearing loud female so it wouldn't be unreasonable to suspect that this commercial woman and could have been responsible for what happened to Artemus Ogletree. However, there was nothing beyond what little was on the internet, and my own personal speculation. The third theory comes from published in the following was killed for being I'd like to call to mind the announcement in the Journal-Post that Ogletree would be buried in a potter's field, the announcement that appeared to prompt an anonymous caller to According to a sensational article, published in the Newcastle Sun, called Mystery Murder in Room 1046, that sequence of events The article states that a to say quote &quot;you have a story &quot;Roland Owen will not be &quot;Arrangements have been made - [Shane] I'm gonna start using it. - [Ryan] A pauper's grave? - [Shane] Well just a pauper's Like if I get a subpar salad. - [Ryan] Oh, this is a pauper's salad. - [Shane] I will not - [Ryan] Or if you get like a hotel room that just has a view of the I'm not gonna sit in - [Shane] Front desk? Yes, I will not accept this pauper's view. - [Ryan] This is Ricky Goldsworth, you know what the deal is. Do you want me to come down there again? Didn't think so. - [Shane] Man that guy's scary. - [Ryan] Yeah he's really scary. When asked to identify herself to the man still known she replied quote &quot;never mind, I know &quot;what I'm talking about, &quot;he got into a jam,&quot; end quote. Before hanging up the phone. At the same time, a man where Owen was held, and said quote &quot;don't bury Owen in a pauper's grave. &quot;I want you to bury him &quot;Then he will be near my sister. &quot;I'll send funds to cover the - [Shane] These people hate paupers! - [Ryan] I think maybe that may have just been slang for the time. - [Shane] Was it? - [Ryan] I mean it seems, just love saying pauper's, either way the more important detail to - Sister's grave. - [Shane] Did they look into - [Ryan] We're gonna - Great. The man apparently explained he was engaged to, and that in room 1046, Owen the man and the jilted girl had a quote &quot;little meeting&quot; end quote. Before hanging up, he said quote &quot;cheaters usually get what's Shortly after, the Rock asking for quote &quot;13 American Beauty roses sent to Roland Owen's funeral&quot; end quote. The voice added quote &quot;I'm doing this &quot;for my sister&quot; end quote. - [Shane] These poor are just trying to make for this brutally murdered man, and they have just this calling them up to deliver If I'm working at that home - [Ryan] You want to come do the job? You want to do my job? How about I be you and you be me. - [Shane] Show up, why (Ryan laughs) Stop just calling me, I'm busy! - [Ryan] It's fucking annoying. - [Shane] You know how hard it is to reconstruct this man's skull? - Other than that, the mysterious death of Artemus Ogletree has on the shelves of investigators, with no other possible leads or clues. To this day, it is unknown in hotel room 1046. Was Ogletree held prisoner? Was he actually punished The case will unfortunately (eerie music) After I read about this case, so I watched clips of people falling on YouTube to go to sleep. - You watched people falling-- - Yeah like a compilation That's what I did. - That's a weird way to make yourself-- - Well you know what? Better to think about a guy in prayer hands (laughs) On his hands and knees bleeding to death. All right, well that's that. - You think they cleaned that hotel after? - Sure, oh that maid - I don't even want to think about that. - Anyways, get out of my house. (eerie music)
