- [Link] Welcome to Good Mythical More. - [Link] We are about to definitively - [Link] determine the strongest, - [Link] most dippable of chips - [Link] on the market. - [Rhett] Hey, now, that's a good promo voice. - [Rhett] Yeah, you need to do all our ads. - [Link] I'm trying to make it up. - [Link] After your criticism. - [Rhett] The baby voice, it just kind of - [Rhett] It just, it turned me off a little bit. - [Rhett] As someone who likes mugs. - [Rhett] But I like the salesman voice. - [Rhett] That was pretty good. I like that. - [Link] It's a wonderful mug. - [Rhett] Why don't we donate $1,000 - [Rhett] to Reading Is Fundamental - [Rhett] to aid in their mission to inspire - [Rhett] a passion for reading - [Rhett] among all children - [Rhett] and engage communities - [Rhett] in the solutions to give every child - [Rhett] the fundamentals for success. - [Rhett] Please join us in giving at - [Rhett] rif.org/donate. - [Rhett] Isn't it ironic that I read that? - [Link] Yeah? - [Link] Being a child that you are. - [Rhett] No, I'm just saying it's cool - [Rhett] that as a child - [Rhett] I learned how to read - [Rhett] it's something I believe in. - [Rhett] You know? - [Link] It is helpful. - [Rhett] Yeah, it is. - [Link] It's important. - [Rhett] It is helpful. - [Link] It's important. - [Link] You know, when we donate to a cause - [Link] that is good, - [Link] I try not to talk about it afterwards - [Link] because it seems like - [Link] I'm making fun of it. - [Rhett] I'm not make fun of it. - [Rhett] Reading is awesome. - [Rhett] Ask Dolly Parton. - [Rhett] She's really into getting people - [Rhett] to read. Y'all know about that. - [Rhett] Dolly's always doing things. - [Link] So we got a sack of pennies here. - [Link] We've got some fake hands, - [Link] and we've got chips. - [Link] Are these all the chips? - [Rhett] Yeah. Well, I mean, I mean, no. - [Link] How do we determine the chips - [Link] that are competing here today? - [Link] Let's go through them. - [Rhett] Hold on, so y'all have, - [Rhett] you've got chips over there - [Rhett] that are like ready to go - [Rhett] in a box. - [Matt Carney] We tried to represent, - [Matt Carney] have a representative of every style. - [Matt Carney] So, circle, triangle, scoop made of chips - [Matt Carney] or made of chips? - [Matt Carney] Made of corn. Not made of corn. - [Link] Let's start with the ubiquitous Tostitos - [Link] and then whatever you want to do - [Link] after that. - [Rhett] These are the scoops one though. - [Link] Oh, let's not start, - [Link] what's the - [Rhett] I think Mission has a rounds. - [Link] These. - [Rhett] These are pretty straight down - [Rhett] these are white corn. - [Link] Yeah. Give us - [Rhett] These are just white corn - [Rhett] triangle chips. - [Link] So we're, okay, - [Link] so we're really testing - [Rhett] We're just doing this to make - [Rhett] y'all have to do things - [Link] Well, that one's already broken. - [Rhett] This is a pretty chippy chip. - [Rhett] You know what? I imagine - [Rhett] that those folks who made - [Rhett] that Wheel of Mythicality video, - [Rhett] that they got this chip out - [Rhett] and they're like, oh, - [Rhett] look how chippy your chip is, - [Rhett] You know? And they were like, - [Rhett] Hold on, hold on, hold on. - [Rhett] This is the chippiest chip. - [Rhett] This is the chippiest chip - [Rhett] we've ever chipped. - [Rhett] And they were like, well, - [Rhett] let's make a Wheel - [Rhett] of Mythicality video. - [Link] Do you want to hold it? - [Rhett] I love that about that. - [Link] Yeah, it's great. Do you want to hold it - [Link] or do you want one of these to hold it? - [Rhett] Why not one person do hands - [Rhett] and one person do real hands. - [Link] No, I'm going to stack - [Link] and you hold. - [Rhett] Oh, okay. - [Link] I'm stacking pennies. - [Rhett] Well, here's the thing. - [Rhett] My hands are going to be - [Rhett] the same hands every time. - [Rhett] So the only reason that these - [Rhett] would make sense is if we were both - [Rhett] doing it separately or just - [Rhett] because we thought it was cute. - [Link] Yeah, we're over that. - [Link] We're over cute. - [Rhett] Really? - [Link] Well, you didn't like my voice. - [Rhett] Your little mug promo - [Rhett] is a little too cute. - [Rhett] We've had enough of that today. - [Rhett] You're right. - [Link] One penny. - [Link] Let's just go ahead - [Link] and jump to the chase here. - [Rhett] Give me five pennies. - [Link] Two, three. All right. - [Link] So this is four additional, - [Link] which brings us to five pennies. - [Rhett] I think I could - [Link] Is that a good spot? - [Rhett] I think I can go 20, - [Rhett] but I think the limiting factor - [Rhett] is going to be - [Rhett] how balanced I can be, not how many. - [Rhett] I think basically, you know what, - [Rhett] I think you may need to do - [Rhett] a corner here - [Rhett] and a corner here. - [Link] Oh, really? - [Link] Six, seven, eight, nine, - [Rhett] More. - [Link] 10 - [Rhett] Faster. ((Laughing)) - [Link] Nine. - [Rhett] Oh, God. - [Link] 10 ((Laughing)) - [Link] 11 - [Link] You shouldn't had rushed me. - [Link] 12, 13 - [Link] Tilt it back a little bit. - [Link] 14, 15 - [Link] 11, 12, 13 - [Link] 13 - [Rhett] It's gonna take a while. - [Link] 14 - [Link] What else are we going to do here? - [Link] 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. - [Rhett] Go to 20. - [Link] 20. - [Rhett] I think I can get 40 pennies - [Rhett] on this thing. - [Rhett] 40 cents. - [Rhett] You got any nickels? - [Link] 20. - [Link] And then we've got - [Link] one, two, three, four, five here. - [Link] We go with five more, - [Link] brings us to 20. - [Link] This is 20, right? - [Link] 25. - [Rhett] We can always count them again. - [Rhett] When they fall. - [Rhett] Yeah we're, oh gosh, we're at 25. - [Link] 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. - [Rhett] This chip is strong - [Link] There's 30. - [Link] Okay. - [Rhett] So somewhere between - [Rhett] 25 and 30. - [Link] Somewhere between 25 and 30. - [Link] And now let's bring up - [Link] the next contender. - [Rhett] So we're going to say - [Link] and the way you choked up on it. - [Link] You got to be consistent. - [Rhett] And then I always - [Rhett] eat the corner at the end. - [Link] All right. So that's that. - [Link] What about the blue corn? - [Link] Let's go with blue corn here. - [Rhett] So we might have to come back - [Rhett] and make that a little more precise. - [Stevie] Was it between 25 and 30? - [Rhett] Yes. - [Rhett] It did. 25 and then it broke at 30. - [Link] So pick a good one for that. - [Link] And then what I'm going to do - [Rhett] I can already tell you - [Rhett] this is not as strong as the last one. - [Link] One, two, three, four - [Rhett] I already know. - [Link] Where these pennies from? - [Rhett] The Treasury. - [Rhett] The U.S. treasury. - [Link] They're dirty, they stink. - [Link] They smell like bad pennies. - [Rhett] They're got some dirty pennies? - [Link] Yeah. - [Link] You know that one time - [Link] I went on a bender in high school - [Link] and then Jason told me, - [Link] you suck on pennies - [Link] and they won't smell your breath. - [Rhett] Who's they? - [Link] My family. - [Link] Anyone who would judge me, - [Link] including you. - [Link] Thank you. - [Rhett] Yeah, man. - [Link] But I never did it again. - [Rhett] That's right. - [Link] I never under age drunk again. - [Rhett] Look where we are now. - [Link] That's a good one. It's turned up. - [Link] Ready to go. - [Rhett] So this was already broken, - [Rhett] on the edge. - [Rhett] But I think I still got enough of a platform. - [Rhett] I can guarantee you - [Rhett] it will not get to 25 pennies. - [Link] All right. So this is, - [Link] it's not really a great surface for it. - [Rhett] It's the best of the blues. - [Link] You don't get that flat. - [Link] All right. So that's five. - [Rhett] It is so close to my fingers. - [Rhett] I just feel like that's - [Link] 10 - [Link] Three, four, five. - [Link] This is 15. - [Link] Where do I put the? - [Link] 15. - [Rhett] This might. - [Link] And this is 20 right here. - [Rhett] I think 20s going to do it. - [Link] 19, 20 - [Link] It may surprise you. - [Rhett] Maybe blues stronger than yellow. - [Link] Three, four, five. - [Link] We're going for it. - [Rhett] What is this? - [Link] 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. - [Link] 25. - [Rhett] Now you have to do, - [Rhett] You have to do individuals. ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] Okay. So they're tied. - [Link] 20, somewhere between 25 and 26. - [Rhett] I know that the yellow one - [Rhett] would have gone beyond 26. - [Link] Right. So this one loses to that one. - [Rhett] Well, but no, I mean, - [Rhett] maybe there's something stronger. - [Link] See, but these are all the pennies - [Link] right here. - [Link] I mean, it really. I don't know. - [Link] This is not science. - [Rhett] No, it is. - [Link] All right, - [Link] so what are we going with next? - [Rhett] Let's move to rounds. Rounds - [Rhett] They're round. - [Link] 3, 4, 5. - [Link] Pick out the perfect round. - [Link] 2, 3, 4. - [Rhett] The perfect round. - [Rhett] The roundiest round. - [Link] See, they picked out the perfect chip. - [Link] Now we're picking out the perfect chip. - [Link] Do we commission these Wheel endings - [Link] so they fit so well? - [Link] What's the process of picking - [Link] the Wheel ending? - [Rhett] A.I. - [Link] A.I. - [Link] Five. - [Link] Yeah, tell us. - [Stevie] We get a lot of really - [Stevie] nice Wheel endings and - [Rhett] We get a lot of bad ones too, let's be honest. - [Stevie] Well, I didn't. - [Stevie] You don't have to say all that. - [Link] What's the process? - [Stevie] Our producers curate thematically - [Stevie] as much as possible. - [Link] So when the Wheel endings come in, - [Link] somebody watches every single one - [Link] and then writes key words down - [Link] about them, like, - [Link] perfect chip. - [Stevie] Yes. Yes. - [Link] So that then, like, it could be years later, - [Link] we're searching for chip. - [Link] And then something comes up, - [Link] perfect chip - [Stevie] You know what? - [Stevie] And they send in key words as well. - [Link] Oh, they do? - [Link] That's part of the - [Link] submission process? - [Rhett] You said that just like - [Rhett] you just learned that. - [Stevie] No. - [Stevie] No. - [Link] Listen. - [Rhett] Hold on, but you know what? - [Link] The beauty of this team - [Link] is that we don't have - [Link] to know everything. - [Rhett] That is the beautiful thing - [Rhett] that was just illustrated - [Rhett] is that the people who know - [Rhett] the least at this company - [Rhett] are these two guys - [Link] Look, focus. - [Rhett] And then the person - [Rhett] who knows the next least is here. - [Stevie] This is untrue. - [Link] You're making her defensive, I love it. - [Link] You know, the next least to us. - [Link] And then - [Rhett] We are a collective. - [Link] This is 20. - [Rhett] We are a collective. - [Link] So when you submit your Wheel ending, - [Link] is there a Google form or something? - [Stevie] Google form, yes. - [Link] And you put the key words in there. - [Link] So if like if you're specific - [Link] and creative, - [Link] this is 20. - [Rhett] Now you're going to, - [Rhett] people will be gaming the system. - [Rhett] people are going to be adding - [Rhett] all kinds of, - [Rhett] do you have a limit to - [Rhett] how many keywords? - [Rhett] Add it now. - [Link] All right. - [Link] We're about to go to 30 here. - [Rhett] Yeah, the round, this feels great. - [Rhett] It feels like it's so strong. - [Rhett] That's why they make wheels round - [Rhett] and not triangular - [Link] So that - [Link] All right. That is 30 - [Link] And now we are at - [Rhett] Drive over a stack of pennies - [Rhett] with a triangle wheel. - [Rhett] You follow the logic? - [Link] All right, so this is 35. This is 35. - [Link] Yeah, keep watching what you're doing - [Link] and watch what I'm doing as well. - [Rhett] There's a space right there for you. - [Link] Where? Right here? - [Rhett] No, to the left. - [Link] No, I don't want to do that. - [Rhett] I think you should. - [Link] I don't think they'll fall. - [Link] I think this right here. - [Link] That's 35. - [Link] 34, 5 - [Rhett] What about this little section here? - [Link] You want me to put them back here? - [Link] This is 40. - [Link] This is 40 pennies. - [Link] This is 40 pennies. - [Rhett] That's 40 cents, guys. - [Link] And then from there. - [Rhett] I think you can go 45. - [Rhett] I think you can go still fives. - [Link] All right. So this is 45 going right here. - [Link] 45. - [Rhett] I don't think - [Rhett] we're going to get to 50. - [Rhett] I can feel it. - [Link] We're going for 50. - [Link] We are going for 50. - [Link] And then I'm going to shove them - [Link] in right here. - [Rhett] Your technique is really - [Rhett] interesting to me. - [Link] Have you ever seen that thing that's like, - [Link] oh, are all the coins going to go over - [Link] when you add a little coin? - [Rhett] We definitely should have this - [Rhett] on TikTok live ((Laughing)) - [Link] All right, so this is - [Link] What are we at? - [Rhett] 50, man. - [Link] Already? - [Rhett] That's half a dollar, Link. - [Link] 55 right now. - [Rhett] I got half a dollar on this chip. - [Link] Easy. - [Rhett] What is that? - [Rhett] 55? - [Link] That's 55. - [Link] And now we are going for 60. - [Link] We are going for 60. - [Rhett] This is a strong chip. - [Rhett] You could put somebody's eye out - [Rhett] with this thing. - [Rhett] This is one of those things, - [Rhett] if you got caught in a tornado. - [Rhett] You'd decapitate somebody. - [Link] Two, three, four, five, - [Link] we're going for 65. - [Link] We're going for 65. - [Rhett] If we get to a dollar, - [Rhett] I'll buy you a Cadillac. - [Link] Oh, yeah? - [Link] Used or new? - [Rhett] Used. - [Link] Okay. - [Rhett] Yeah. - [Rhett] Probably like a 91 Seville. - [Link] That's 60. - [Rhett] DeVille. Is there a DeVille type thing? - [Link] we are now going for 65. - [Rhett] I had a Cadillac one time. I sold it for - [Link] We're now going for 70. - [Rhett] $400. - [Link] We are going for 70. - [Link] We are going for 70. - [Link] 70 cents. - [Link] Put it right back here. - [Link] There it is. That's 70, - [Link] that's 70.That's 70 pennies on a chip. - [Link] It's a round chip. - [Link] We are now moving to 75, - [Link] 75 cents. - [Rhett] This is so hard to believe. - [Link] On a round chip. Here we go, - [Link] right back here. - [Link] Now, now, so then - [Link] we've got to restack those. ((Laughing)) - [Link] This is a bit frustrating ((Laughing)) - [Link] All right. - [Rhett] Oh, that Cadillac is slipping away. - [Link] 75. - [Link] 75 cents. - [Link] I'm rebuilding back to 75. - [Rhett] What do you think about - [Rhett] this technique. - [Rhett] Going down, placing and releasing? - [Rhett] You don't like that idea? - [Link] Nope. I'm going to stack all of these - [Link] back up. - [Rhett] Because it feels like - [Rhett] you're pushing the stack - [Rhett] every time you stack. - [Link] Well, - [Link] how's that for a compromise? - [Link] And these, I got to restock those there. - [Link] I'm gonna put a few vertical right there. - [Rhett] You know, the hardest job here - [Rhett] is holding the chip. - [Link] You're doing pretty good. - [Link] All right. - [Link] So now we are back to 75 cents. - [Link] We are just going to get to 75 cents. - [Rhett] That's a pretty penny. - [Rhett] I didn't know - [Rhett] that's what pennies look like now. - [Rhett] With a shield on the back? - [Link] 75. - [Rhett] Y'all got these from the bank. - [Link] And what we are going to do now - [Link] is we are going for 80, - [Link] we are going for 80. - [Rhett] It's not going to make it to a dollar - [Link] 80. - [Link] So now we are going for 85, - [Link] 85 pennies on the chip. - [Link] The round chip. - [Link] The round chip has 85 pennies attempting. - [Link] There, that's 85. - [Rhett] I can't believe it's not breaking. - [Rhett] It feels so brittle. - [Link] And then. - [Rhett] Oh, oh. - [Rhett] 85 pennies. - [Link] We were so close. - [Stevie] I wanted the Cadillac to happen so bad - [Stevie] because you'd have to - [Stevie] go through with it. - [Stevie] And then there'd be all this press, - [Stevie] and then they'd have to trace it back - [Stevie] to what we're doing right now. - [Stevie] And it would so weird. - [Link] What would the headlines say, Stevie? - [Rhett] Man Buys Other Man Cadillac ((Laughing)) - [Link] Man Buys Man Used Cadillac. - [Rhett] And then underneath it, - [Rhett] cause that's the clickable part, - [Rhett] underneath it, it says - [Rhett] Internet duo stacks 85 pennies, - [Rhett] stacks 100 pennies on a tortilla chip. - [Rhett] Had to dig deep for that detail. - [Link] Okay. - [Rhett] Nothing's going to beat that. - [Rhett] Let's just rule some things out. - [Rhett] I love beans, but beans make weak chips. - [Rhett] Everybody knows that, - [Rhett] but let's just prove it. - [Rhett] And I think the way you do this - [Link] Sea Salt ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] Take, like, - [Rhett] all you gotta do is, - [Rhett] you could get a stack, - [Rhett] a bunch of stacks of pennies - [Rhett] and it's anything under 85 - [Rhett] and it breaks. - [Rhett] Then these are ruled out. - [Rhett] You know, you don't - [Rhett] have to do the full stack. - [Link] That is a thick chip, though. - [Rhett] They're brittle, though. - [Rhett] So just take like a, - [Rhett] no, no, no. - [Rhett] Take a stack of like 20, 10s, - [Rhett] do 10s and just do a couple sexy tens - [Rhett] and it's going to break, telling you. - [Rhett] See? Already broke. - [Link] Yep, it broke. - [Link] All right now pick out the next one. - [Link] What? - [Link] That was a bean. - [Rhett] Bean's gone. - [Link] Yeah, of course. - [Rhett] We got scoops. - [Link] Scoops is the only contender. - [Rhett] Scoops, scoops, scoops. - [Link] Scoops is quite a contender. - [Rhett] You might be able - [Rhett] to stack inside of them. - [Link] Yep, yep, yep, yep. There we go. - [Link] There we go. - [Rhett] Okay. I got to get the scoopiest one. - [Link] But what did it take to get a Cadillac? - [Rhett] 100. - [Link] A dollar,. basically. All right. - [Rhett] Okay, this is tough because - [Rhett] I have to introduce a new holding technique - [Rhett] because I can't. - [Rhett] This is "zodd" - [Link] Hello, Zodd. ((Laughing)) - [Link] Go ahead. Okay. - [Link] Yeah, because it just, - [Link] it's right there. - [Link] It's just waiting for pennies. - [Rhett] Yeah, but I don't know - [Rhett] how you're going to do this - [Link] Single stack. - [Link] It can be like a Mongolian restaurant - [Link] where you're like, - [Link] when you're building the - [Rhett] Oh, yeah. - [Link] You're building the bowl. - [Rhett] You counting? - [Link] Oh, you see that? - [Rhett] Are you counting? - [Link] I'll count them when they fall. - [Link] Oh, yeah, here we go. - [Link] There's a lot more to go. - [Link] It's just I don't even know - [Link] if they're going to fit, but - [Link] what we're going to do is - [Link] we're making a nice little - [Rhett] Nest. - [Link] Nest. - [Rhett] A penny nest. - [Link] Making a nice little penny nest for him. - [Link] And we're doing this, - [Link] we're doing this on the Internet today - [Link] for you. - [Link] You've stuck around. - [Link] You believe that this is worth it. - [Rhett] It is. - [Link] And, uh, - [Link] there's a Cadillac - [Link] waiting on the other side. - [Rhett] We could do 100 - [Rhett] Link get's a Cadillac. - [Link] Used. - [Rhett] A well used Cadillac. - [Link] I am. - [Rhett] Oh, I've got crackage. - [Link] You got crackage? - [Rhett] I've got crackage. - [Rhett] It's not going to last. - [Link] Well, that helps, doesn't it? - [Link] When I knock off - [Link] some of the pennies. - [Rhett] We're definitely not getting to 100. - [Link] I can't even stack anymore. - [Link] My arms are so tired. - [Link] Is your thumb tired? - [Link] Pretty good, though. - [Link] It's a good showing. - [Link] There it goes. - [Link] All right, what's the final one? - [Link] What's the final one? - [Rhett] Oh, Bumpys. - [Link] Bumpys. Go with the bumpy. - [Link] All right. - [Rhett] Now, what makes these bumpy? - [Link] I don't know. - [Rhett] Why are these bumpy? - [Stevie] Are those the cassava flour? - [Rhett] Cactus. - [Rhett] Yeah, cactus ain't going to do it. - [Link] Cactus and sea salt. - [Rhett] I've had enough experience with this - [Rhett] to know cactus ain't going to do it. - [Link] Here we go. - [Rhett] Just to prove it, - [Rhett] stack 20 on there at once. - [Link] You know what I'm going to do? - [Link] I'm gonna go for a dollar - [Link] right from the beginning. - [Rhett] Okay. All right. - [Rhett] Okay. - [Link] Cadillac coming my way. - [Rhett] Okay. - [Link] Don't be so nervous. - [Link] Hold it together. - [Link] It's a Cadillac. - [Rhett] I didn't expect it. - [Link] There's a Cadillac on the line - [Rhett] Something happened in my brain - [Rhett] when you got ready to do it, - [Rhett] it was just - [Link] Okay. - [Link] Don't be nervous. - [Link] They're not that expensive. - [Link] Come on, man. - [Rhett] I'm not doing this on purpose. - [Rhett] I'll do two hands. - [Rhett] I'm reinforcing. Okay? - [Link] I want this Cadillac. - [Link] I want this Cadillac more - [Link] than I wanted anything. - [Rhett] I know. I want you to get it too - [Link] I understand it is used. - [Link] I like it used - [Link] Somebody else is parking it in. - [Rhett] You can do it, you can do it, - [Rhett] you can do it, you can do it. - [Rhett] I trust you. ((Laughing)) - [Link] It's okay. ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] This is the dumbest bit - [Rhett] we've ever done. - [Link] Steady. - [Link] Steady yourself. - [Rhett] You broke it with a dollar. - [Link] Get another one. Come on. - [Link] One more. - [Rhett] I'm sorry, man. We're out of time. - [Link] Oh, come on. No. - [Rhett] Tune in next time. - [Link] No! - [Rhett] That doesn't count. - [Rhett] I have to be holding it - [Rhett] for you to get a Cadillac. - [Link] The weather outside may be frightful, - [Link] but this mug is so delightful. - [Link] Shop the new Sweater Weather Mug. - [Link] Available at Mythical.com
