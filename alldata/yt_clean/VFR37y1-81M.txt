- [Ryan] This week on Buzzfeed Unsolved we investigate the one of the most gruesome - That's a, that's a hell - He's not the most definitively, but I will say he's one of the most. He's in the upper echelon for sure. It's not a shiny badge of - You sound like you're impressed. - I'm not impressed, the things he did were pretty, for lack of a better term, gross - Gross. - Okay, whatever you say. Between 1934 and 1938 in Cleveland Ohio, near Kingsbury Run, 13 people, comprised of six women and seven men were killed by a serial killer. Of those 13 only three were identified. And almost all of them were All of the victims were decapitated, and in some cases the - He just killed anybody. You also will see, he like this guy just didn't give a shit. - He's just death. - The killer often dismembered And in no instance was a These gruesome tendencies Cleveland Torso Killer or the Here's a little background In the 1930's, Cleveland's Kingsbury Run was a bleak, dangerous place, where many poor lived Sometimes called, a quote, Just east of Kingsbury called the Roaring Third, gambling dens, and brothels. - [Shane] I'm into - [Ryan] The Roaring Third? - [Shane] Yeah! - [Ryan] Is that a back in the day? - [Ryan] You'd be dead. - [Shane] It's got... - [Ryan] He'd see you, and he'd say oh man I got some - Bars, gambling dens, and brothels. - Yeah. - Now, currently, now a but we have a lot of I got YouTube, I've got my Playstation, and pretty much that's it. But back then, not a lot so I would for sure, be down at a bar, a - So this is part of the recurring theme that you've had throughout the show, where if there weren't - An insane psychopath. Yes. - [Ryan] With the stage set, let's jump into the timeline of the killings. On September 5th, 1934, the first victim, an unidentified woman in her 30's, was found on the shores of Lake Eerie. All that was found was part of her torso, thighs, and other body parts. But no head. Her skin was leathery and red On September 23rd, a 28 year old man named Edward Andrassy, was found near Kingsbury Run, - [Shane] (giggle) - [Ryan] That's actually I know that was gonna - [Shane] Sucks. - [Ryan] So just get it, - [Shane] It sucks. - [Ryan] just get it out of the way. - [Shane] It sucks to die like that. - [Ryan] At the base of Jackass Hill? - [Shane] Yeah, where'd they find him? Oh the base of Jackass - [Ryan] I'm sure they omitted - [Shane] Why even call burros there at some point or a donkey? - [Ryan] Andrassy was a hospital orderly and a regular around the Roaring Third. The body was drained of With rope burns on the wrists. On that same day, the third An unidentified 40 year old male, and was also decapitated and emasculated. The body also had the from the first killing. On January 26th, 1936, the fourth victim a woman named Florence Polillo, was found wrapped up in newspaper by the Hart Manufacturing building. Polillo was a sex worker, who lived in the Roaring Third. He's getting bolder with the The first one was a on the side of the hill, the third one was nearby to the hill, and now this one, in front of an actual workplace. - [Shane] Yeah. - [Ryan] In, you know, On June 5th, 1936, the an unidentified man, was found wrapped in trousers in Kingsbury Run, the rest of the body in an even more audacious location. In front of the Nickel Plate So once again, he's escalating. - Yeah. One of the saddest parts to me is that, so many of these bodies were unidentified. - Yeah. - Because it's just, I'm always of the opinion that once I'm dead, you can do anything you want with my body. Throw it out in the street But I at least want people yeah that's Shane, that was Shane, who is being eaten right now. - That's Shane in that - Give him a send off, whatever, say your kind words about him. - That'd be a happy dog, On July 22nd, 1936, the sixth victim, an unidentified 40 year old man, was found in the woods near Clinton Road. The man had been dead for two months. One noteworthy observation suggesting he had been killed on-site, and not dumped there, as - [Shane] So this is walking around who gets, gets got. - [Ryan] Well, the thing to me about this, is because have been dismembered in a way Most likely done after death. This is one that seems to be Which either means to me, or since it obviously is the same guy, he's getting antsy, he's losing his grip, he doesn't care anymore and that aren't as premeditated. On September 10th 1936, an unidentified man, was in Kingsbury Run, he had In a manner that the coroner in one stroke, which was both brazen and - [Shane] This is gross, but I think it's hard to cut off a head. - [Ryan] It apparently is kinda hard. - [Shane] Yeah. - [Ryan] And there was one case, where someone had, it took them, I forget which royal it - [Shane] Yeah. - [Ryan] It took five strokes. Also, another thing, I was reading this one who watched someones head get He said the head rolled around, and he saw the guys eyes, - He blinked? - He blinked, and he saw recognition in the eyes when he said his name. - Wasn't there an old tale of someone who for science, told the to blink as long as they could? - Oh see that's kinda cool. - Yeah that's pretty cool. - But if you were a piece and you're getting executed the lease you could do, - You could do this thing for science. - One solid on the way out. - For science man, give - It'd be better to not would you give us a, - A wink? (laughs) - Cause your vocal cords are gone, right, so but you could wink. - I mean I guess it depends, if they, I would ask them to chop it so I could roll over and be like, Hello my baby, hello (laughs) - [Ryan] At this point the murder spree on a near daily basis, and yet, there were no suspects or clues. As expected, this put a on the investigating authorities. Detectives Peter Merylo interviewed over 1,500 Here's even a picture of Detective Merylo undercover as a vagrant. - [Shane] That is the most - [Ryan] Is the most (laughs) - [Shane] He looked like he in which Bugs Bunny was on the railroad. And was like, yup, that'll do. - [Ryan] You think he in that little bag there? - [Shane] Probably. - Maybe this is like accurate to the time. - I don't think it was. - So you think that he was just like, I bet you this is what vagrants look like, and he went out there and he was like jesus christ I don't - Probably. Probably actual people who and then this guy walking the Warner Brothers set. - [Ryan] Jumping back into the timeline, on February 23rd, 1937, an unidentified woman in her 20's, were found on the shore On June 5th, 1937, the ninth victim, determined to be a was found under the Her remains were merely a On July 6th, 1937, the tenth victim, an unidentified man in was found in the Cuyahoga River. His heart was ripped out and The proximity of the killings - [Shane] He got to enjoy which is my favorite holiday. - [Ryan] I guess he did. - [Shane] I think that's - Yeah I suppose if I getting murdered July 3rd or July 6th, I'd choose July 6th. - Always a silver lining, - With a belly full of hot dogs and brew. - Yeah. - [Ryan] In April/May of 1938, parts of the eleventh was found in the Cuyahoga River. Interestingly, this was the first time that a victim had drugs in their system. This left authorities to were recreational or used Maybe this contributes to why the stokes were so confident, and so absolute. - [Shane] Cause they weren't moving? - [Ryan] Because they weren't moving. - [Shane] Hmmm. - [Ryan] And the only reason I posit this, is because drugs may be involved in one of the case's main suspects, later. - Okay. Pretty horrifying to imagine and you can only just move your eyes. Have you ever had that? Is that in a movie? - That's in Wolf Creek. - Yeah. - A serial killer cuts so they can't move, so what's happening to their friend. - But their eyes can move. - But their eyes can move. - That's horrifying. - It is pretty scary. As all of these gruesome Mayor Harold Burton, Safety Director Eliot You may know Eliot Ness who led his illustrious to bust Al Capone's breweries. Other credits to Ness's glowing resume included defeating the Mayfield Road mob, crooked police, and labor racketeers. Contributing to his status As City Safety Director, the fire and police departments, and given his decorated track record, Ness was at serious risk should he not make With that in mind, let's On August 16th, 1938, the both unidentified were found in perhaps the most reckless location of all. The bodies were found office window, a taunt that - [Shane] Oh wow, that's bold. - This fucking guy. You're gonna coast out, and you're gonna coast into retirement, right, you know? - Yeah. - Everything's great, and at the last leg, this piece of shit comes in, - Yeah. - and just starts messing with you. Commits some of the most - Yeah. - In your playground. And then, he puts it and - [Shane] Yeah. - [Ryan] Two days later at 12:40 AM, Director Ness, and police officers raided They rounded up 63 men, and scoured the shacks for an sign of the killer. Most noteworthy, in a move Ness then ordered the the people displaced were then charged with being homeless, which Ness's involvement in this has been referred to - [Shane] Okay. - [Ryan] This, it, I mean, I can't find what's going Let's burn it all down. - [Shane] It's literally - [Ryan] He literally went scorched earth. - [Shane] Yeah. - [Ryan] According to James Badal, the preeminent expert on this case, Ness's raid was intended in a bizarre and backwards way. Ness wanted to eliminate the thinking that the killer Which, to be fair, was true. He also wanted the in the event that they were later killed. - It feels like maybe is exactly that, it's just an excuse. When people are like an entire population of people, and setting their homes on fire? Suddenly he needed to come - He's coming to his senses. - Yeah, and going, uh, fingerprints? Like it seems like he's just - He was just like, fingerprints. - Fingerprints. - I need fingerprints, that's... - Sure. - [Ryan] Either way, the Whether or not the raid had anything to do with that is debatable. Certainly, Ness's shiny by this action, and it also no closer to identifying the killer. That being said, the case to be unofficially the solution was reached With that, let's get into the suspects. The first suspect was 52 In July of 1939, Dolezal was Martin O'Donnell, for the murder of Florence Polillo, the fourth victim. Dolezal had actually lived Furthermore, Dolezal also knew victims Edward Andrassy and Rose Wallace. Following his arrest, to murdering Florence Polillo. However, he later said he had been beaten and recanted his confession, in fact, Dolezal had suffered six broken ribs while in the custody of the sheriff. Further casting doubt upon the confession. The confession appeared to be coached, as it was a mix of prepackaged details and incomprehensible ramblings. According to case expert James Badal, the lead detective on the case &quot;This is the first time &quot;anyone to confess to a crime &quot;of the crime to which he was confessing.&quot; - [Shane] They beat the - [Ryan] A hundred percent. - [Shane] Yes. - [Ryan] And it's very very sad. - [Shane] Yes. Him knowing numerous people I mean, he knew, so a lot people who lived in that neighborhood, - [Ryan] Yes. - [Shane] Or in the shantytown kinda? - [Ryan] I think what happened is, they saw he lived with one of the victims. - [Shane] Yeah. - Then they found out he knew the other two victims who were identified, and they thought, lotta pressure from the mayor, the public is starting to get pissed off. I think it's time to do the deed. Nonetheless, Dolezal remained Which makes the event that One month later, in August in his jail cell before going to trial. Hanging himself on a hook that was five feet and seven The problem with that is, Frank Dolezal, was five feet and eight inches tall. Logically, how could a from an object that they were taller than? It seems like it may be for him to hang himself - [Shane] You can, I don't - It's suspicious to me, given They coached his confession out of him, maybe they're starting... you're saying the police maybe had, oh that didn't occur to me - What I'm saying is, on this particular guy. - Yeah. - They beaten him, they've they start to think this is - Oh, okay, I did not put that together. - [Ryan] In addition forensic science experts that The experts concluded that the way people were told he did. Though, the experts don't explicitly say he was murdered while imprisoned. Either way, virtually no one believes Frank Dolezal was the killer. A marker, purchased by was laid on Dolezal's with Dolezal's family that reads &quot;Rest Now&quot; Thus vindicating Dolezal posthumously. In these Unsolved episodes it's not often that we get nice sentiment. And this, - [Shane] Let's hang on to this - [Ryan] This is, actually very lovely. - [Shane] Rest now, that's nice. - [Ryan] That's nice. The second and final suspect is Dr Francis E Sweeney. In the 1970's Sweeney was discovered to be Safety Director Eliot Sweeney is also thought according to case expert James Badal, who as of 2014, had spent 18 Dr Francis E Sweeney fit the profile. He was a doctor, and would've and anatomical knowledge Sweeney had also been And his wife noted his His abuse of her and their two sons, his days long disappearances, and his neglect of his practice. Shortly after the final murder, Sweeney checked himself after which the killings stopped. In 1956, Sweeney was In May 1938, Eliot Ness taking him to the old Cleveland Hotel. Ness kept Sweeney there as it took Sweeney three - Just Ness brewing coffee the whole time. Slapping him in the face, - Mug of water in his face. - Tickling his feet with - [Ryan] Miranda Rights Though, this process was still in conflict with the rules of civil The inventor of the modern administered a lie Which he failed, twice. Keeler told Ness,&quot;That's your man. &quot;I might as well throw &quot;if I say anything different.&quot; - This makes me wonder if he in his mind thought he was sort of a You know, cause Bruce Wayne very powerful man. - Are you comparing the - I'm not. - It sounds like you're comparing - I'm just saying I think thought that he, - Is Batman. - Was the Batman type. Except Batman never that would really ruin it. - Yeah Batman didn't kill people, he just, knocked them out a little bit. He's not Batman. Ness had to proceed was a cousin of congressman I wonder if this affiliation, violating civil liberties, keeping the lie detector test a secret. Regardless, despite this revelation, Francis Sweeney was released, and less than three months later, the final two torso victims were placed within view of Ness's window. Seemingly to mock him. Ness would continue to get In the 50's Ness received from someone claiming And since Sweeney was a secret suspect, I would imagine it's was indeed Sweeney. - [Shane] What do the note cards say? - [Ryan] They pretty much say nonsense. - [Shane] Do they implicate or is it him essentially just... - [Ryan] It's him knowing that even if these note cards were taken to court, - [Shane] they wouldn't mean anything. - [Ryan] They wouldn't mean anything, which is, even more infuriating. - [Shane] Yeah. - [Ryan] Unfortunately, the case, Ness didn't have Though, the case against In 1938, a vagrant named that in 1934, a doctor tried to drug him. He remembered the office East 50th and East 55th Unfortunately when authorities he couldn't find anything a medical office, and from there, his story was dismissed as irrelevant. However, more than 70 years later, case expert James Badal, practiced medicine out of at the corner of Broadway This building closely matches where Fronek remembered getting drugged. It's in this building that could've drugged Fronek Though, the torso killer in a large amount of blood evidence. So, how could Sweeney have in these offices, without - Spread out tarps, and just whoosh. - Cause I imagine it would be I know this looks bad. - He's got a head cold. (laughs) - [Ryan] The answer may the leader of the Scientific who was interviewed by the Cleveland Police Historical Society in 1983. Cowles suggests that Sweeney may have had an agreement with an undertaker. That he could practice surgery in the undertakers funeral home. If this is true, a funeral as a way to dispose of blood evidence. This arrangement, however, as directly next door to Sweeney's office was a funeral home, in had a concrete ramp located that conveniently led to Both Sweeney's medical are a short car ride away victims were found, which was In Badal's opinion, Sweeney near the center of town, to his office with promises - He just made an agreement with them say, yeah you can work on our dead bodies, but then he'd bring in some of his own. - I think that's what it was. - I see okay. - He snuck in some, you - Some of his own sinful collections. - He was getting some of - Yeah. - [Ryan] Badal, with the help of the great nephew of one of was able to use photos and diagrams to compare the torso killer Badal calls the results, &quot;Creepy as hell.&quot; All this information that Sweeney was indeed the killer, though Badal cautions, &quot;I think I put together a &quot;I realize you couldn't take it to court, &quot;and Ness realized back then, - [Shane] It's crazy that all he had to do was follow the rules and gathered some legitimate or at least... - [Ryan] The thing is, all he had was, Sweeney fit the profile, right. - [Shane] Yes. - [Ryan] But that isn't grounds for someone or bringing someone in. - [Shane] No. - I don't know what the rules are, of maybe when you're allowed even submit them to something - Yeah. - I imagine it wasn't enough for him to do it when he did it. - Yeah. - Or ever. Sweeney would have to slip, publicly. There are however some criticisms police and crime reporter Doris O'Donnell, believes that somebody at the funeral home would have noticed something Yet, O'Donnell may be was the sheriff who arrested Frank Dolezal in 1939. I think it's like one of those things where you wouldn't even dare to dream that someone would use this - [Shane] Right. - [Ryan] Cause you're all you see is dead bodies, they're gonna be like using this to uh kill people. Also even Badal acknowledges could have only been utilized before colleagues could become suspicious. He doesn't know where the Others including lead believe the torso murders were that committed murders in Detective Merylo felt that to make the rail trip back and forth between New Castle and Cleveland. Which consequently led of Sweeney as a suspect. But, to be fair, Merylo had about Sweeney's secret I for one, will go on record - I will also go out on that limb. Great work Ryan! - That's the best I could give. - Yeah, so well, I guess I cause you didn't solve... - I didn't do anything, James Badal did. - Yeah. - [Ryan] Regardless, for the most part, the In the case of Eliot Ness and James Badal, they believe that he but in fact the killer. However, we may never be able And for now, the case
