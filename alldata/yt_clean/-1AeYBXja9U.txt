And....Yeah, I have an athletics competition in about two weeks. How's it going? Are you still good? Are you all ready? Actually, I'm not feeling well. What kind of problem are you having? Do you feel worried? Not really. I just don't feel confident There are many talented rivals, and I can't believe I can do it. I'm afraid that I will disappoint people. You don't need to be scared, Loren. You can do it. I believe it firmly. Why do you think so? I believe it. I believe in you. Enjoy it. Fight hard. Play with all you have Can i? Of course you can, try your hardest! Yes, I will do my best. Thank you for your encouragement, Annie. I don't know what will happen to me tomorrow, I'm so worried now Laura. You will have a job interview tomorrow. And now you are overthinking. But what if they ask me a question Calm down, Jimmy. Everything will be fine. If they ask me how to solve a problem and I have no idea how to solve it. You have prepared for this interview for a long time! If everything goes in a bad direction, I'm sure you'll be fine. You'll be accepted into the position Thank you for your encouragement. I feel a little better. I've got butterflies in my stomach now. It's okay, Jimmy it is just a feeling, you can control it, be confident! Be confident. Be excited. Don't be nervous. Tomorrow you will have a steady mind. Step into the interview room And you will surely get your target. Yeah, I agree with you, Laura. I should be confident in myself because I have been working Yes, you can do it. Yes, I can do it. Dad, let me use the computer for a moment. Did you finish today's homework? Well. Not yet. I'll finish it tonight. But the teacher assigned if you don't do it now, how can you submit it on time tomorrow? But the homework is so difficult. I want to take a break. Instead of playing video games You should look for more information It will help you a lot to do homework. Can I play first instead? When you finish your homework, I will let you play computer games. Come on, Dad... Don't be so lazy! You need to focus on what you need to do. Emma, what are you studying so intently? I want to find out more information about aliens After watching the movie &quot;Home&quot; last night. Sounds interesting, so what was that movie about? It theorizes that one day the Earth will be controlled by aliens. The film revolves around the challenging to find the mother of little Tucy and Oh. How did you find that movie? Had an interesting movie, full of adventure but also very meaningful. The two main characters of the film from opposite sides and they gradually become close, They go together and realize I'm curious how the friendship between I'll probably look for that movie today. I heard your family went out for Christmas yesterday. Honestly, it's really an unforgettable holiday when I have the opportunity between family members. So where did you go? We went to a zoo near my house, by green grass and trees, I took a lot of beautiful photos there. Great, so what impressed you the most about that zoo? Not only did I get to see the animals, but I also learned about their behavior and fed them. I think zoos are important to raise people's awareness about protecting nature as well as endangered species. Yudy, what are you running so fast for? Oh my god, Clare, have you seen my laptop anywhere? Your laptop? Where did you leave it? I remember I left it in the school library while doing my homework. But when I went back to look for it, it was nowhere to be found. Or has someone stolen it already? I'm not sure. when I came back to class from the library, I didn't see any forgotten computers. It's a new computer my mom bought for me to prepare for my presentation In the library, there is a small building dedicated to storing lost items and taking care of personal belongings You can go there to look for it. Really? How do I get there? You can go to the block It's near the back gate of the school. I see it, thank you very much. Excuse me, is this seat taken? That's my friend's chair. He's been out for a while If you don't mind, you can take a seat here. Thank you. This is my first time going to a concert Sorry if I bothered you. I met you at the school music club. You must be very knowledgeable Honestly, no, I don't have a broad but listening to music Do you often go to concerts like this? Lately, I've been busy with my exams in class but if I have free time, I'll come. The room seems hot and stuffy. Yes, it's summer now. Do you mind if I open the window That will make the room more airy. But it's hot outside if you open the window the sun will shine in. Or do we close the windows and Good idea. It can cool the room in the fastest time. It should have been in the evening when the air is quite cool and pleasant, We should open the window to ventilate the room. And during the day, close the door to avoid stuffiness. I get it, I'll pay more attention. So for now, where is the air conditioner remote? Hello, can I sit here? Okay, this place is still empty. Are you a new student? You look so strange. You must not be from here. Since I am an international student, Thanks to the International student Really? What's your nationality? I'm Vietnamese, and I am studying In an international associate university program. I will learn about the educational program as well as the extracurricular activities here. Actually, my mother is also Vietnamese. My parents have been in the US So you're an American citizen? Yes, if you feel the need, I will help you get used to the educational program here. Sounds good, thank you. Good morning Amanda, why are you going to work so early today? I just moved to a new house So after bringing some stuff to my mom, Really? So how do you get to work? Before, my house was quite far from the company, so I used to take the subway but now I only need to walk about 10 minutes What about you, what vehicle do you use? My house is about 7 km from here every day I ride a bicycle to exercise, and at the same time enjoy the riverside view in the early morning. That sounds good, because using a bicycle Before, if you went to work by car, it would take you half an hour to get to the company. Yes, and of course, that helps Jenny, do you also go to the library after school to look for references? Not really, I just want to find more books to expand my knowledge, but if I need to prepare for a project or presentation, I just look for scientific materials. What genre of books do you usually choose to read? Science books, of course. I'm majoring in biological research so books in this genre will be very helpful. What about you, what books do you usually read? I think soft skills books presentation skills, learning design, and sales are great. They help me improve and promote the necessary qualities in my future career. What happend today Mary? you don't look happy. My brother broke my laptop by mistake, I had to take it in for repair all week What a pity! So how many brothers and sisters do you have? I only have one younger brother. But as you can see, he is very naughty, often breaks my things, and is very stubborn. I think he didn't mean to upset you, Maybe because he's quite hyperactive. Do you have siblings, Mart? No. I'm the only child in the family, so it's quite lonely sometimes. Actually, I really want to have brothers and sisters in the house so that I can share my thoughts and sorrows, for example. Yes, you're right. We're going to have a presentation on how to help students So, where should we start? In my opinion, we need to start by giving an overview of people to give more information Then we'll talk about discrimination in schools. And finally the solution. Do we have to do a PowerPoint part? I think we should. That makes it easier for the audience And it's also convenient to summarize the main idea of the talk. Should we make a short video interviewing some students in the school about the issue? That will make the talk more convincing? Sounds fine. So let's get started. We've made it to Disneyland in Los Angeles. Thank you, how much do I have to pay? According to the meter on the car, the fare is $ 45. Do you have cash? Yes, but at first I thought going to About $30. Yes, but because of the traffic jam today I had to turn around the highway It took longer than going straight, I'm not worried about the price. I'm just afraid of being late It's okay, here, you can keep the change. Thank you. What are you reading, June? A very good storybook The story of a seagull and the cat who taught her to fly. What's it about? That bird is caught up in an oil spill a dying seagull scrambles ashore to lay her final egg and lands on a balcony where she meets a big black cat. The cat promises the seagull to look after the egg Unbelievable. So what do you think about this book? Not only is race a feature of this book, that it's important to help those less The story also condemns which has a bad effect on nature and creatures. Humans really lack awareness I know even just for the sake of short term, but sometimes they accidentally destroy There will be a presentation contest in French at the school club. The judges will have to give a statement are free to express their thoughts. as long as they can convince the judges. Why are you so interested in this contest? It seems it's only for members Yes, but it is an opportunity for us to learn more from other excellent students especially the skill of expressing ourselves in French. It's up to you, it's nothing special to me anyway. I'm not good at French so I wouldn't understand anything if I went to see the competition. You can ask Peter to come along, maybe he'll enjoy it. All right, let me try it. You don't look very well Cindy, what happened? I'm not very well today I feel dizzy and have a headache Maybe because I couldn't sleep last night. No, really, you have a fever. If you don't feel well, you can ask the teacher to let you go to the medical room to rest. If your condition gets worse, you should go to the doctor for an examination. How are you feeling now? I feel cold and tired, I must have caught a cold. Maybe I shouldn't continue studying today, I'll call my mom to pick me up. Okay, if you're sick, don't try to go to school, it'll only make it worse. Now go home and rest, maybe you need to go to the hospital. Yeah, thank you. Hi, Emily. Do you remember next week is Judy's birthday? I wanted it to be a surprise but I was still confused about choosing an eye candy birthday present for her. Oh, I've forgotten! Let me see... What kind of present should we prepare for Judy?... Should we buy her a new shirt? I don't think so, Dan bought her a new T-shirt anyway. Last year we bought an eye candy snow Now I'm thinking about the CD but I'm never really sure what music she likes... Also, we need to think about the cost. We need to consider Judy's hobbies. She is always writing letters so I think a pen will be useful. Sounds great. So which colors are we going to buy? Well, the purple and black ones aren't very good, they're too dark. How about a gold color one? I'm sure Judy will like it That's what I had in mind. I did my best to prepare for the project in the last presentation but it seems like everyone didn't I have heard your presentation, about the main ideas in the lesson It's very specific and precise. So I think the problem lies Really? You see what I said? When giving a presentation You did not keep eye contact with the audience You only focused on looking at the paper that made the audience feel like you were But this talk is so long, I can't remember all of it. Besides what I speak in front I'm afraid that I'll say the wrong thing. It doesn't matter. You just need to cross out the main ideas and then paraphrase it Your speech is too long and contains It makes me want to fall asleep. Oh man, thanks for your advice, I'll pay more attention. Jenny, why do you look so tired today? I couldn't sleep last night So this morning I woke up late Do you have frequent insomnia? Lately yes, I often wake up in the middle of the night and it's hard to go back to sleep. Because I don't get enough sleep, I feel very tired the next morning. If you keep losing sleep so often, Why don't you go see a doctor? I've been studying for my finals lately, so I don't really have time And I think this insomnia is caused by Don't underestimate it. lack of sleep will greatly affect your study in class and also test results. Okay, okay, I'll go check it out today. Anna, will you come to my house tomorrow, it's my brother's birthday. Really? that's great Do you need my help with anything? I have allowed my brother I also want to buy the necessary My sister will come home So I have about three hours So you just have to come and have fun. But I can't just come and play. What about the dishes for dinner? For dinner, my parents decided to order food at a nearby restaurant I asked my parents to let me organize a barbecue. It'll be interesting. Okay, I'll bring some whiskey then. Hi Sue, do you have any plans when you graduate from high school? I think about that all the time. I had to choose one field for my higher studies. I want to study business. But my parents forced me They had their own justification and prospects You can just study in your favorite field if you do well at it. I see business as a potential Yes, but I don't know how to choose. You can check out some blogs their experiences about their decisions and their consequences. You can ask for advice. It can help you with your capabilities, Thank you. I would give my ears for it. Hey, bro. How was your holiday? It was the best. I stayed home all day, played video games, and played with my dog, Ali. Oh... What video games did you play? I played &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot;, &quot;The legend of Zelda&quot; and &quot;Minecraft&quot;. That's cool! How was your holiday? I practiced basketball all the time and I took some photos. I realized how wonderful it is to take great landscape photos. Hey, what are you guys talking about? Ah... Hey, Bella. We're talking about holidays. How was your holiday in Paris? I definitely enjoyed Paris. An absolutely beautiful city! That sounds great. The city makes you fall in love with it the first time you be there. I can't believe I made such a stupid I feel like such an idiot. Stop it! You're not an idiot. We all make mistakes sometimes. But it was a really important project, and I messed it up. Now I'm worried I'm going to get fired. Don't jump to conclusions. Just talk to your boss and explain what happened. They might be more understanding than you think. I don't know. I feel like I let everyone down. Look, everyone makes mistakes. It doesn't define you as a person. What matters is how you handle it and what you do to fix it. You're right. I just need to figure out a way to make it right. Exactly! And I'm here to help you. We can work together and come up with a plan to fix things. Thanks. I appreciate it. I don't know what I'd do without you. No problem. That's what friends are for. So stop beating yourself up and let's focus on finding a solution. Hey, Daniel. Are you free? Tom and I are going to play basketball. Will you join? Oh, I wish I could, but I can't. Something wrong? What are you doing? I'm doing my homework. Oh... All right. Good luck with your homework. See you later. Come in. I just bought a new video game. Do you want to play with me? That's great. What is that? Survival. I think you'll like it. Oh, I really want to play now, but... I have to do my homework. What homework is that? Math. You know, I don't really like numbers. I struggled with it all day. I can help if you want. Yes, of course. Thank you! You look so tired. What's wrong with you, Alex? Lately, I've been so stressed at work. Busy work makes me often stay up late. That makes me hot tempered... and often quarrel with my wife. That's not good at all. You need a vacation to relax. Yes. I surely need a vacation. A vacation can improve your mental health and help you feel refreshed. Yeah, I see. Take your wife on a trip That will help improve your relationship with your wife. I will write an application for a day off and spend more time with my wife. If you want to travel, I suggest Bangkok or Paris. Thank you for your suggestion. I'm really looking forward to the party today. I heard today's party is huge. Really? Is that a rumor? It's not a rumor. It's the truth. It is Daniel Moran's birthday party. I'm also looking forward to this party. Don't get carried away. I know he is the son of a billionaire, but it is also his parent's money, not his. You're not excited about the party, are you? I only care about food. I'm afraid there's a lot of food there. I think there will be a lot of food there. Why are you afraid of that? I will get carried away and I will eat a lot, which will make me fatter. You are the thinnest of all of us. Hi, Neil. I would like to introduce you to a new colleague. Sure. This is Adam Parker. He will replace Emily to support you in your work. Hello, Mr. Neil. I'm the new graphic designer.

So I'll finish it later. Really? I just talked to her. She said she'd like to meet you to get a report on the research. I don't know. I guess she wanted to discuss something about research. Newton. Have you finished the research yet? Not yet... But I need it now. But you said I can finish it next week. I know. So now you and I will do it together. I want it as soon as possible. Ok. Let's do it. The weather is beautiful today. A beautiful day for our picnic. I prepared sandwiches, potato salad, and fruit. Thanks, Mom. And I prepared orange juice for us. Let's eat. Mommy! Can we give the man sitting there some food? Of course. Bring him this bowl of potato salad and orange juice. Yes, Mom. Excuse me! My mom makes a lot of food, and we want you to try this one. Hope you like it. For me? Yes. My mom makes a really good potato salad. Please try it. Oh, thank you. This is the best potato salad I've ever tasted. I'm glad that you like it. I really want to go shopping. Will anyone go with me? I don't want to go shopping right now. I have a lot of clothes that I haven't had a chance to wear. Oh, okay. How about you, Emily? Would you like to go shopping with me? Okay. But first, I need to get rid of my old clothes. I have two boxes filled with old clothes. You can donate those old clothes to someplace like Goodwill or Salvation Army. Can you send me the information about those places? Ok. I'll send it to you right now. Please send it to me, too. I have several old clothes I need to donate. Okay. Hey, Patrick! Moran and I are getting together for lunch. Do you want to come with us? Oh, I really want to. But... maybe next time My friend will come to pick me up for lunch. What a pity! Where are you guys going for lunch? We'll eat at the newly opened Korean restaurant across the street. I've eaten there already. Oh, really? How was the food? It was so good. The taste was so original. They have lots of traditional Korean food. Oh. You are making me excited. Have you made a reservation? Not yet. You should call the restaurant to ask if a table is available. You're right. I'll call them now. Happy birthday, Newton! Thanks for inviting me to your birthday party. Here's my birthday present. Hope you like it. Thank you so much, Linda. You are so thoughtful. And here is a little gift that I have prepared for you. Thanks, Peter. This is the first time I received a gift from you. Really? Yeah. So for my next birthday, I definitely have to invite you. Because I haven't received any gift from you either. Okay. Remember to invite me. I will definitely come. Has the party started yet? The others haven't arrived yet. I think they'll be in 10 minutes. Follow me. I'll get some drinks for you two. Ok. Thanks. What are you reading, Dad? I'm reading a very interesting article. What is that? It's about a haunted house. Really? Is it true or just a rumor? I don't know. The article also raises the question Where is it located, Dad? It's located at 6 King Street. I think it's just a rumor. There are no ghosts at all. Hey, David, what's wrong? What are you doing? Nothing. Just watching TV. What's up? Come with me to explore a house at 6 King Street. Wait a minute. 6 King Street?? I heard somewhere that this house is haunted. Right. That's why we're going to explore it. It sounds interesting, right? No. There are no ghosts at all. Do you allow your kids to play outside the house? Yes, of course. It's necessary for the development of the kids. Playing outside allows kids to develop more motor skills. Because they can walk, swing, play catch, climb trees, and ride bikes. Do you allow your child to play alone outside? No, I mean now, I don't allow my kid plays alone outside. He's just 6 years old. I think children who have reached the tween years are generally safe enough to play outside alone. Yeah, that's right. Do you often let your kids play outside too? Yeah, that's right. She's two years old now. I often take her for a walk to let my baby enjoy the fresh breezes, bird songs, forest smells, and plants. What are you doing, Mom? I am making tea. I'm making you a cup of tea, Andy a cup of tea, and Dad a cup of tea. Thanks, Mom. What tea is that? It's green tea. Do you want to try it? Yes, yes, yes. I want to try too. Of course. How do you feel? It's bitter. Is it okay if we add a bit of sugar to the tea? Yeah, that's right. Yes. Sugar and green tea tastes good, but green tea is better without adding sugars and flavor. I've only been here a week, but I've heard almost everyone mention Jessie. Who is Jessie? She's the leader of the sales department. She's very good at negotiating. I want to meet her. I'm curious about her. She's right over there. He is a potential customer, but I think it will be difficult for us to convince him. I see. He's a hard nut to crack. But I think I can convince him to agree to the contract. I've never doubted your ability. So I made an appointment to see him at 3 P.M this afternoon. Okay, sir, I will not let you down. She is really confident. There is something about her that is very attractive. I think so, too. Hello, Tom. Daniel, Anne and I are going to the movies. Let's go together. The movie only takes 2 hours. I really want to, but I can't. The name of the movie is The Adventure of Friends. So we can't go without you. Because I've been playing all week. Now I need to focus on studying. Oh, my God. It was your mother who said it, not you, right? Yes. And my mother told me this. You can go outside to play under one condition: You have to finish your homework! That's right. Here's a strawberry smoothie and cookie for you. Thanks, Mom. My girlfriend is mad at me again. What's wrong? She said that I don't care about her. Really? She was watching a movie, and I was playing a game. She said she was hungry and she wanted something to eat. Then she asked me what I wanted to eat. I said it's up to her. She said I was only interested in the game, and then she was mad at me. What did I do wrong? How do I know that? Girls are complicated. I can never guess what's in their mind. I know, right? I apologized but I didn't know why I was wrong. Poor you. Maybe you will find out one day. Why do you look so sad? Would you like to share your problem? We can listen. Yes. We are best friends. But if you don't want to share, we also respect you. Of course I want to share with you. But it will be extremely difficult to understand. We've been friends for ten years. I think we can understand each other. That's right. We believe we can understand. Emily wants to come back to me. What is your answer? I agreed with her. What? You got dumped by her 2 times. Last time she cheated on you with a rich man. You said you could understand me. You are a fool. Oh, my bro. I have just bought a new game. Do you want to play with me? Sorry, but I can't play the game with you tonight. I have an exam tomorrow, so I need to hit the books tonight. Oh, I have an exam tomorrow too. We can hit the books after playing the game. No, Peter, not today. Maybe next time. That's boring. I don't want to play alone. If you don't hit the books now, you'll surely fail. You've had enough of time wasting. Okay. Okay. I'll hit the books first and then I'll play my game Mom. Does Dad often stay up late at night? On days with a lot of work, he often stays up late. Yesterday at 2 AM, I got up to go to the bathroom and found Dad was still working. Staying up late is bad for us, isn't it? Yes. What should we do for Dad? You can advise him. How, Mom?? You can tell he knows the importance of going to bed early. How important is that? Good sleep improves our brain performance, mood, and health. Not getting enough quality sleep regularly raises the risk of many diseases. I don't want Dad to get sick. Don't worry, sweetheart. I will pay attention to my health. So don't stay up late, Dad. Okay. Do you promise? I promise! The vacation is coming. Where do you think we will travel together? I think we should travel somewhere with a lot of sunshine. We can go to the beach and sunbathe. That sounds good. What do you think of that, Max? That's a good idea. So which country are we going to travel to? How about Riviera maya in Mexico? Ok. I've never been to Mexico either. Let's go there. Great! Can my siblings come with us? Sure. The more the merrier. Who do your siblings include? My older sister Linda, and my younger brother, William. That would be fun. We should plan our trip right now. Yesterday I heard Susan and her boyfriend arguing. Really? I didn't know they argued. They've been dating since high school. But this was the first time I heard them arguing. What did they argue about? I just saw them arguing, then she calmed down. She spoke softly and comforted him. Should we ask her? Or let her share with us first? I don't think we should ask. Let her share with us first. Hi, girls. Hey. How are you? Daniel and I broke up yesterday. Why? We couldn't make each other happy or better. I don't know. But I can't keep going. I know you put a lot of thought into making this decision. Everything will be fine. Hey Alex. How are you? I'm fine. How are your studies going? So so. How are your studies going in Spain? Everything is great. Have you had any difficulties at school? I learned that Spanish is quite difficult. Yeah. But now I can communicate with native speakers. Really? It was only a month. Amazing, Alex! Do you remember Alex? Yes, of course. He is studying at university in Spain. Right. You went to Spain last month. How is he? Now he can speak Spanish with native speakers. It was only a month. Yeah. He is quite good at learning new languages. No doubt. Why are you sighing like that? My boyfriend is so messy and he never cleans his own mess. Never? Yes. I always remind him and complain to him about it all the time. I hate doing it because it makes me look like his mom. If you can't accept it, let's have a serious talk with him. You're right. Max! I have something to tell you. Will you talk about how messy I am? That's right. I washed all my socks, washed our clothes, and washed dishes. Really? My mom said she broke up with her ex-boyfriend because he was so messy. I'm afraid that such things will happen to me. I don't want to lose you. You're so cute. Yesterday, I heard my cousin say this phrase while on the phone with his friend. Which phrase? Hit the Jackpot. What does that mean? It means you hit a guy named Jackpot. Really? No. He is teasing you. Hey! Hit the jackpot means achieving great success, or suddenly getting or winning a lot of money. You could say &quot;Lady Gaga hit the jackpot with her first two albums.&quot; or &quot;JK Rowling hit the jackpot with her Harry Potter series.&quot; Oh. I see. Thanks, Olivia. O-M-G, I hit the jackpot. Really? Here, look! I don't see anything. I'm just kidding. I didn't hit the Jackpot. You're always not serious and always joking. Because life is boring. I'm making it fun. Not fun at all! Now it's the reporting date. We promised each other not to shop too much and save money last month. Remember? I broke our promise. I can't live without shopping. How much did you spend on your last shopping spree? $3,000. Oh, my God. What did you buy? Please don't ask. How about you, Stella? I broke our promise too. Seriously? But I spend less money on shopping than Anna. It was $2,000. How about you, Julia? You must have saved a lot of money. I spent on my last shopping spree $3500. What? I thought you two would be a good example for me to follow. Sofia, wake up. Mom! Dad! How long have you been napping? 1 hour. I guess. You forgot to close the door, didn't you? The door? Oh my god. I completely forgot. After taking out the trash, I felt extremely sleepy. Oh, you left the door open? I guess so. Did you hear it? Yes. There's something in the kitchen. Is it because I forgot to close the door, and the thief broke in? Oh... A cat! You're so cute. Can we adopt this cat, Mom? Okay, If this cat doesn't have an owner. We should ask the neighbors if they have lost any cats first. Okay, Dad, I think I will find a part-time job. You already have a part-time job. I plan to take an extra course, so I need more money. My brother has opened a club and it looks like he needs help too. I'll contact him and let you know. Thank you, Matthew. But you should pay attention to your health. Don't try too hard. I will. Ahhh.... Hey. Are you okay? I have a stomach ache, and I feel dizzy. Mom! How do you feel? I feel better. The doctor said that you work and study too hard. That is the cause of your stomach ache and fainting. Oh, my God. You must take good care of your health. I'm sorry to worry you. I booked a table at a restaurant. After work, I will come home and we can go to the restaurant together. That's so sweet. But today is not our anniversary day at all. I know. I was so busy these days that I can't spend much time with you. So I want to do something for you. Thank you, honey. See you tonight. Love you. Come in. These are the documents you will need for today's meeting. Meeting? Yes. You have scheduled a meeting today with the marketing team. Oh, no, I forgot. I'm in a pickle. What should I do? Should I cancel today's meeting or change the date with my wife?
