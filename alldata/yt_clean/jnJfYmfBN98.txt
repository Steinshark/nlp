I'm based in the Netherlands. <i> NARRATOR: Together, these <i> a potentially <i> about the ocean's RYAN: I think myself and a lot wrapped up in the speed, the size, the strength But as you look at them, you realize maybe there's And that's when we caught on are these sharks actually to become almost camo sharks? <i> NARRATOR: Camouflage is common <i> Octopuses, squids, and <i> of lightning-fast color shifts,</i> <i> and blending into an <i> to both prey and predators.</i> RYAN: All these other animals and sophisticated techniques But sharks, <i> NARRATOR: Great whites are <i> on the dorsal side <i> with a white belly underneath.</i> <i> This countershading <i> whether seen from <i> But the ability of sharks <i> would be a revelation.</i> RYAN: The theory that and modulate their color There has been on smaller species of shark, but never in anything the size never on a predator as a great white shark. Now, proving it is gonna be <i> NARRATOR: To put their theory <i> Ryan and Gibbs are launching GIBBS: We heard just about about these sharks But then you look and you find actually that might show that <i> NARRATOR: Great whites can be <i> around the world.</i> <i> And in South Africa, GIBBS: So I got these photos This is a massive database all through the entire He's matched up all these <i> NARRATOR: The collection <i> of thousands of sharks.</i> RYAN: Nostalgic looking back GIBBS: Yeah. RYAN: Yeah. <i> NARRATOR: Key identifiers like <i> mean scientists can <i> the color of individual sharks.</i> RYAN: See, this one here than the other one. This one's dark, <i> NARRATOR: RYAN: Yup. This is all GIBBS: The problem we had in are modulating their color didn't have a frame of reference if this shark was actually <i> NARRATOR: Lighting conditions, <i> and even camera settings</i> <i> can completely change RYAN: If we're gonna prove that is actually the shark we need some type of control. And that's when I came up <i> NARRATOR: The grayscale <i> to collecting visual evidence <i> through a range of experiments.</i> RYAN: It's impossible for us a color of a shark in the wild. That's the beauty As long as I can get photographs and the sharks together, correct the colors, then I can find out <i> NARRATOR: These experiments <i> to the factors that RYAN: There has been a few to show that sharks and that it is What I'm hoping to do that great white sharks and that it is related GIBBS: When I look at it, but it's, it's actually how this really solves getting this, you know, RYAN: I think it's I ever been called a genius. I'll take it because it is rare. The next step is, how am I gonna next to the shark And that just takes So, you got that, mate? GIBBS: Alright, cool, yeah. RYAN: Careful, careful, Keep the tension. GIBBS: There we go. It's gonna be exciting stuff. RYAN: One of the most important is the breaching test. GIBBS: Breaching is sort of You know, they need RYAN: This is when we're gonna of a great white shark in <i> NARRATOR: In the middle of RYAN: This island is the in South Africa. <i> NARRATOR: Every day, <i> swim for their lives...</i> <i> through a gauntlet RYAN: The great white shark's in hunting Cape fur seals and that's really high With these sharks, where they want and it's usually right that the seals are exiting <i> NARRATOR: Ryan and Gibbs <i> in the hopes of encouraging RYAN: It's about trying to alongside a color board, and being able to measure the <i> NARRATOR: It's a quiet morning,</i> <i> but Seal Island GIBBS: Oh, there's a predation! Natural predation Oh, still going for it. RYAN &amp; GIBBS: Oh, oh! GIBBS: Oh-ho! This is hot--Oh! RYAN: This, this seal GIBBS: Yeah. He's using RYAN: And even though the shark it scared that seal so much and it's now hiding around <i> NARRATOR: The seal leads RYAN: Woo! Oh, yes! Got it! Got it! GIBBS: Nice one, man. <i> NARRATOR: The shark <i> are clearly in frame.</i> It's the first successful breach GIBBS: It sends goosebumps I mean, you just can't, you every time you see it. <i> NARRATOR: Sharks are here GIBBS: Oh-ho!

Science is not fast; it takes a lot of data. Nice. RYAN: Particularly when you're on sort of This is money in the bank, <i> NARRATOR: But there's more to RYAN: The behavior is only The cellular work and it's equally as important. Yeah, it's a male. <i> NARRATOR: Ryan and Gibbs <i> with their investigation.</i> RYAN: So that's a juvenile. A chance to get to work comes around, you know, for at least me. GIBBS: First time. <i> NARRATOR: When sharks <i> in fishing nets...</i> RYAN: Okay, that's good. <i> NARRATOR: ...scientists <i> ensure it isn't in vain.</i> MATT DICKEN: at the Sharks Board is collect And that really improves of this incredible species. <i> NARRATOR: Dissection will let <i> to their color change theory,</i> <i> hidden in the stomach <i> The diets of great whites <i> and change as they grow larger <i> So what and where sharks eat <i> about their need RYAN: It's quite tough, eh? I want this definitive proof do, in fact, feed at feed at the bottom. And this is sort of the to actually identify what MATT: You know what that is? MATT: Stingray barb. MATT: So again, I'm thinking the real evidence you need that these white sharks GIBBS: Right on. Outstanding. RYAN: Dang. <i> NARRATOR: This small find <i> The ability to adapt camouflage <i> to the vastly different <i> at the bright surface RYAN: Great success with You know, finding that and that the sharks do have that we wanted. GIBBS: And there's a whole <i> NARRATOR: But the key to <i> is scientifically possible GIBBS: My research is based and the different that cause their skin to work One of these adaptations is this ability to change color. We wanted to design that would sort of tell us <i> NARRATOR: The secret to <i> at the molecular level,</i> <i> with a little known cell GIBBS: A melanocyte is the to pigment in animals. It acts kind of like underneath the skin where it sort of flexes based on what the animal needs. So let's say you have the circuit board tells And, you know, vice versa, it'll cause your pigment i.e., it goes paler. <i> NARRATOR: To understand <i> and capable of changing <i> the team has devised GIBBS: We're gonna try and take of the skin of the shark and to see if this actually does And we're hoping that as each with the tissue, it actually causes them <i> NARRATOR: The hormones <i> that are believed to flow <i> during behavior like GIBBS: We do have for what these hormones will do. The first one, MSH, is actually the expansion of the melanocytes in just about every species We have the adrenaline which has in some sharks and has also in some fish. And then the last hormone And we think this is a paling response. <i> NARRATOR: If the test works,</i> <i> it should change the color GIBBS: This feels like seeing how these sharks actually RYAN: Ready? <i> NARRATOR: But the samples GIBBS: I actually don't the skin is really reacting. It's... Looks more or less the same. The dead shark skin doesn't I think that's just because is physiologically dead. So all the little biochemical This is a new experiment. And I think this is that it doesn't work Yeah, I think Ryan and I are gonna have to tweak <i> NARRATOR: Most sharks are <i> Some, like the tiger or zebra,</i> <i> have distinct patterns <i> In False Bay, South Africa, <i> a species with an adaptation GIBBS: Puffadder sharks one of the most docile sharks. You'll oftentimes see them sort or snuggling around RYAN: So they're cute. They're not like a great white, But puffadder shyshark to exhibit biofluorescence. And that means essentially it's <i> NARRATOR: Why a shark would RYAN: They're incredibly that we'd find them on. And I always wondered why would on camouflage <i> NARRATOR: Ryan designed <i> outfitted with UV lights RYAN: Ready, buddy? <i> NARRATOR: Documenting them <i> diving this shark-filled bay RYAN: Night diving is And tonight, all we're gonna which is essentially The rest of it's <i> NARRATOR: In the deep, dark <i> some species of marine life <i> not to camouflage, but to glow.</i> <i> These abilities are called <i> and biofluorescence.</i> <i> Bioluminescence is <i> in which an organism <i> Like a lantern shark that glows <i> or plankton glowing <i> Biofluorescence is a different GIBBS: Biofluorescence is to take in a certain and re-emit RYAN: As you go deeper, except for blue light. And what these puffadders is take in that blue light, then that sort of gives them this GIBBS: The key here is to light and color to be better So we're here to explore and their survival. <i> NARRATOR: Many corals, <i> and even some crabs <i> when exposed to UV light.</i> <i> Swell sharks in California <i> that mimics how they <i> Why is not exactly known, <i> it comes down to <i> while still retaining RYAN: And what we think is that the shark's eyes evolved sort of spectrum of the light. GIBBS: This is an adaptation so they can essentially at night from other organisms, but still <i> NARRATOR: Even as they glow <i> camouflage remains key <i> as it may be for GIBBS: Biology is inherently We understand more by understanding how <i> NARRATOR: Whether camouflaging <i> the puffadder's appearance <i> to its behavior.</i> RYAN: So there's two parts One is that individual sharks and two, that their color by different activities. <i> NARRATOR: <i> the team sets out in search <i> to document for their database.</i> RYAN: I know this is a resting So the idea is to try next to what I think And if it is that by the hormone levels, you could find that is a very different color to one that's motivated <i> NARRATOR: While Ryan <i> Gibbs captains (propeller whirring) RYAN: Hey, I got a shark. GIBBS: You got one? GIBBS: Alright. Let's throw this RC boat in. Okay, let go, let go. You got it. RYAN: Go, you got to go hard, GIBBS: Can you see me? RYAN: Not yet. Not yet. GIBBS: Uh, going forward still. RYAN: Gotcha. RYAN: I gotcha, buddy. (Ryan laughs) RYAN: I'm just gonna GIBBS: Yeah. You got me there? RYAN: Yeah, I'm gonna just so I can get the color... There we go, GIBBS: Nice. RYAN: Okay, that's good. There she is, she's up GIBBS: Yeah. Outstanding. <i> NARRATOR: A resting shark <i> It could provide <i> to the great white mid-hunt.</i> RYAN: This is just one piece <i> NARRATOR: <i> of resting at the surface, <i> the team also needs to capture <i> when sharks are scavenging.</i> RYAN: Color changes very quickly as you go deeper The reason why I'm so interested down deep is because how a shark at the surface is very different to how it would camouflage <i> NARRATOR: Ryan will be lowered <i> in his custom dive cage.</i> RYAN: Come on out, and let's GIBBS: We lost the GoPro zoom. It's gonna be in the cage. Oh, she's gonna go Nice. The purpose of this whole, to the boat was to get them Another shark. Drew, look at her RYAN: When you are you don't know if what you're because the light and the visibility is so bad. So that's why it's that we have that color board and we can capture the shark and the color board together. 'Cause then I can and work out truthfully what GIBBS: Now she dives down. These sharks are giving us <i> NARRATOR: It's a rare glimpse</i> <i> into the great white's <i> where they scavenge RYAN: The whole setup What was striking me It is the camouflage that That ability to blend and that environment down there Hey, you work for it. GIBBS: Yeah, sure. <i> NARRATOR: With their database <i> Ryan and Gibbs are finally able <i> further afield to reports <i> and another unique GIBBS: As part of on sharks and color, we're looking for another that may actually be able for the sake of camouflage. <i> NARRATOR: Species like <i> use unique skin patterns <i> to camouflage into <i> But sharks with changing <i> A study in the Maldives <i> whether a genetic condition is <i> this uncommon adaptation.</i> GIBBS: We are here in in a place called Baa Atoll looking for a very rare type <i> NARRATOR: Tropical reefs <i> and adaptation.</i> <i> While some creatures <i> others do all they can <i> Could this unique case <i> to how great white skin GIBBS: My perspective on what close to these is down at the molecular level. This report came out and it had these images that had developed this And I think this might be caused by a genetic disorder Leucism is a genetic trait that's caused by the malfunction So when it stops we start to see this where melanin pigment <i> NARRATOR: Gibbs is using <i> seeking photographic evidence</i> <i> and genetic samples <i> But is this condition <i> Or possibly rapid adaptation?</i> GIBBS: This genetic disorder is, is like a freak accident. It might have the exact key to be camouflaged better If these blacktip reef sharks it really means that these found a way to actually live around the human impacts And I say this has actually experienced quite from climate change. Sea surface temperatures and that's caused So when you see the coral reef, there's a whole bunch mixed in with the living corals, and that makes the environment have this random And I think these sharks might in their environment that haven't developed From the report, we found that these sharks that have which makes me think that either these sharks and growing out or maybe this, uh, But all we would need is proof with this trait to say that that they are surviving. The Maldives is a perfect place to find these Unfortunately, Hey, Ryan, how's it going? RYAN: I'm doing well, man. I'm curious, very curious Have you managed to be able do the genetic samples, GIBBS: I haven't been able to Unfortunately it's, uh, than I expected. But we did manage to get one in plain view. So that's, that's something. RYAN: Do they actually blend in? GIBBS: I would definitely say is matching that random pattern And unlike the smaller ones, leucism is actually presenting It's almost like these larger RYAN: Wow. The zebra shark as they grow up, <i> NARRATOR: Like the zebra shark,</i> <i> this group of blacktips could <i> as they grow and become <i> And while any <i> seems to be connected to <i> leucism appears very different <i> affecting the skin GIBBS: Whilst we are seeing I don't think this is exactly when I came out here. RYAN: Now I've been thinking and the skin sample test We didn't get the response. I want to know more about this GIBBS: Clearly the, So I would suggest that and collect some of this live so that we can actually to change in real time. <i> NARRATOR: While the team <i> to collect live samples,</i> <i> Ryan begins to <i> on his color board database RYAN: We've put the color board where we can see a shark We've also taken the color board And then we've also looked The most exciting experiment, was getting the color board next to breaching, hunting In this type of behavior mode, these sharks need to maximize If we can match up the sharks we can see whether those sharks, and then secondly, how that color relates <i> NARRATOR: The first step <i> of an individual shark</i> <i> that were captured RYAN: The idea is that the identification of the shark over different images, And now I've got one shark, this shark with a very distinct that we've been able to see <i> NARRATOR: Ryan carefully <i> so the grayscale color boards RYAN: The goal is adjust the We can adjust this square here Once we've done that, we know is exactly correct. <i> NARRATOR: Once calibrated, Ryan <i> the color of the shark, in <i> assigning their skin shade RYAN: One being very dark, 100 being very white, We can't always get the entire but we can work with certain So we've got it here. We've got the breaching, scoring a score of around 22, which is a very dark color, the same shark is and it's scoring around 54, 53. So, clearly, light coloration, Is it at the stage where we But what it has proven is that has the ability to change color. And over time, we're gonna be and work out how individual and whether the color that is related to what activity <i> NARRATOR: <i> after months of field work.</i> <i> But the next stage of the <i> to proving that great whites RYAN: Second, we're gonna switch And that is getting live samples getting them down to the under the microscope. We're gonna be able to answer whether these great whites can, (birds squawking) <i> NARRATOR: Gibbs and Ryan <i> for one final molecular test.</i> RYAN: The behavior is only The cellular work and it's equally as important. <i> NARRATOR: But this time,</i> <i> they'll need a skin sample GIBBS: The reason we go out is because the shark skin and thus, theoretically, to the hormonal treatments That's why we're taking so we can make sure We are bringing the lab I've got my sampling probes which I'll attach Uh, you can see I've got that give that so the tissue stays alive long RYAN: If we can get live tissue and witness under the microscope and aggregating, If it dies, it's all wasted. <i> NARRATOR: A successful <i> definitive evidence for <i> But first they need a sample.</i> GIBBS: To be in the cage is probably the best we're going to get I would lie if I said I wasn't Uh, there is with dealing with these animals. RYAN: I'm gonna try to get GIBBS: Mm-hmm. RYAN: And then I'm gonna try and come close to you And that's when GIBBS: We got this. RYAN: We got this. I think that's--Oh, bait! Oh! That's gone, that's gone, that's Come on, Gibbsy, the sharks GIBBS: The margin of error So I can sample them so that I can get and also not harm the sharks. RYAN: Here he comes. Woo! They're fast! RYAN: Dang! MAN: Good eyes. (camera snapping) RYAN: No, no, no. He speared it! He speared it! Nice! It was actually Nice work, Gibbs! Perfect. Woo! How did that look? GIBBS: It worked out perfectly.

That's where the tissue You're gonna stay far away if you hit just at the base Perfect little skin tag. MAN: Got it. RYAN: You know, I know that, about his aim with that, so beautifully just at the base MAN: It's perfect. RYAN: ...it makes me Out of the blue, eh? MAN: It is a new shark. Yup. RYAN: He was so shy Just suddenly... Torpedo. Shows you what these things got MAN: Oh, there he is again. RYAN: We have to look on this See if that-- Problem is if we sampled No, no.
