It never hurts to get a lot of just going to do a bunch more long division problems. And so if you have And I don't know exactly why and we saw this in the I didn't call it long division why is it takes you a long piece of your paper. As you go along, you kind of that develops on the problem. So all of those are, at least, it's called long division. But we saw in the last video division problem while just tables up to maybe 10 But just as a bit of review, as 2,292 divided by 4. And it's actually the same seen this notation before, This, this, and this are on some level. And you could say, hey Sal, in case you have seen And that is exactly what it is. It is a fraction. But anyway, I'll just focus on videos we'll think about other So let's do this problem. So 4 goes into 2 It goes into 2 no times, me just switch colors. So let's move on to the 22. 4 goes into 22 how many times? Let's see. 4 times 5 is equal to 20. 4 times 6 is equal to 24. So 6 is too much. So 4 goes into 22 five times. 5 times 4 is 20. There's going to be a And then we subtract Well that's just 2. And then you bring down this 9. And you saw in the last video When you wrote this 5 up in the 100's place. So this is really a 500. But in this video I'm just process, and you can think more in terms of where I'm But I think the process clear hopefully, by So we brought down the 9. 4 goes into 29 how many times? It goes into at What's 4 times 7? 4 times 7 is 28. So it goes into it at What's 4 times 8? 4 times 8 is 32, so it can't go going to go into it seven. 4 goes into 29 7 times 4 is 28. 29 minus 28 to get our in the problem is 1. And now we're going to We're going to bring it 4 goes into 12? That's easy. 4 times 3 is 12. 4 goes into 12 three times. 3 times 4 is 12. 12 minus 12 is 0. We have no remainder. So 4 goes into 2,292 So this 2,292 divided by 4 Or we could say that this thing Let's do a couple of more. Let's do a few more problems. So I'll do that red color. Let's say we had 7 Maybe it's called long division long up here and you I don't know. There's multiple reasons why it So you say 7 goes So we need to keep So then we go to 64. 7 goes into 64 how many times? Let's see. 7 times 7 is? Well, that's way too small. Let me think about Well 7 times 9 is 63. That's pretty close. And then 6 times 10 is 7 times 10 is 70. So that's too big. So 7 goes into 64 nine times. 9 times 7 is 63. 64 minus 63 to get our Bring down the 7. 7 goes into 17 how many times? Well, 7 times 2 is 14. And then 7 times 3 is 21. So 3 is too big. So 7 goes into 17 two times. 2 times 7 is 14. 17 minus 14 is 3. And now we bring down the 5. And 7 goes into 35? That's in our 7 multiplication 5 times 7 is 35. And there you go. So the remainder is zero. So all the examples I did Let's do one that maybe And to ensure it has a make up the problem. It's much easier to make than the ones that So let's say I want to divide 3 into, let's say 1,735,092. This will be a nice, So if we can do this we So it's 1,735,092. That's what we're And actually, I'm not sure if In the future video I'll show something is divisible by 3. Actually, we can We can just add up 1 plus 7 is 8. 8 plus 3 is 11. 11 5 five is 16. 16 plus 9 is 25. 25 plus 2 is 27. So actually, this number So if you add up all of And then you can add up those So that is divisible by 9. That's a trick that So this number actually So let me change it a not divisible by 3. Let me make this into a 1. Now this number will I definitely want a up with a remainder. Just so you see what So let's do this one. 3 goes into 1 zero times. So we can just move forward. You could write a 0 here and just makes it a little So we just move 3 goes into 17 how many times? Well, 3 times 5 is equal to 15. And 3 times 6 is equal to So 3 goes into 17 right 5 times 3 is 15. And we subtract. 17 minus 15 is 2. And now we bring down this 3. 3 goes into 23 how many times? Well, 3 times 7 is equal to 21. And 3 times 8 is too big. That's equal to 24. So 3 goes into 23 seven times. 7 times 3 is 21. Then we subtract. 23 minus 21 is 2. Now we bring down We bring down the 5. I think you can appreciate why We bring down this 5. 3 goes into 25 how many times? Well, 3 times 8 gets you pretty So it goes into it eight times. 8 times 3 is 24. I'm going to run out of space. You subtract, you get 1. 25 minus 24 is 1. Now we can bring down this 0. And you get 3 goes into That's easy. It goes into it three times. 3 times 3 is 9. That's about as close 3 times 3 is 9. 10 minus 9, I'm going to down here a little bit. 10 minus 9 is 1, and then we I'm running out of colors. I can bring down that 9. 3 goes into 19 how many times? Well, 6 is about as That gets us to 18. 3 goes into 19 six times. 6 times 3-- let me scroll down. 6 times 3 is 18. 19 minus 18-- we subtract 19 minus 18 is 1 and I can revert back to the pink. We bring down this 3 goes into 11 how many times? Well, that's three times 3 times 4 is 12, so So it goes into it three times. So 3 goes into 11 three times. 3 times 3 is 9. And then we subtract And there's nothing When we look up here there's down, so we're done. So we're left with the this entire problem. So the answer, 3 goes into it 578,363 remainder 2. And that remainder 2 was what So hopefully you now appreciate much any division problem. And you also, through this it's called long division.
