As you can see here, the sculpture is of a his parts. But it still works as a sculpture because The bag becomes an extension which makes it of this illusion, so I wanted to make it into I got to brainstorming with the minions and So we're going to give this a shot. I've got some beloved sticks of white oak going to magically turn into something awesome. Dammit, it didn't work. [Jordan] Probably because I'm in the shot. [John] Dammit, Jordan. So to make this work we're going to make Do a little do-doodleski. I think I'm going to build it full, if I make it float. I'm just winging it, but I do want to make So we'll need two 20's and a couple 4's. So let's see what we got. Awesome, lucky-ass material yield because All right. I don't know what I'm doing. Let's lay some shit out. So essentially, I just want to put a little I think I want to do an angled bridle joint, I've never done this. I just love doing things I've never done. Take the angle that I like. Probably going to end up being something absolutely What in the fabricoble's name is Jordan It sounds like he's wrestling a bear. Alright, that's 15 degrees. Crazy. Tis a thing, that resembles a thing, looking [Sam] You did it. [John] All right, kids, so this is what a one to cross it. And if you're curious, what we just did joint--I think an angled bridle joint. I've done these like once or twice. I don't know if we've ever done 'em But regardless, it went pretty smooth. A little bit of sanding and refinement to to do our lap joint in the center here. And to do that I'm going to use the table up yet. To make sure everything is copasetic, we're around, because, pretty sure that's the Now I just need a small clamp. Clampiotomy. It's 14 and 15/16ths. [Sam] 7 and 15/32nds to the center. [John] My favorite number. Dammit. Where's these 32s at? Here's a tip, kids-- [Sam] Here's the lazy way to do it. [John] I have this set to what I think is me center. Now, one thing you're going to run into, of your pencil. [Video] That's a thick-ass boy! [John] It's going to throw things off. So what we've got here is, I took that measurement them and that should get me close enough. Is it the most precise way to do things? No, but when you're me, and you're making 'er done. Heyyy, I'sa made us ah something! I made a thing. I gotta make sure we add that to the album: [Sam] It's good. [John] All right. The 'ol mock-a-rooski here is mocked up, [Sam] How are you attaching the other part [Jordan] Yeah, the post. [John] You got questions? Do you guys doubt me?

[John] So we dry, which means it's time I'm going to touch this up with a little and then we'll work on the joinery for the And then, how we're going to fabricoble or other. So, moving along. Done. [Sam] Still a 2x4 in the ceiling. [John] That's just in case of an emergency. [Sam] You know why that's up there, right? [John] Back break. [Sam] That infamous day. [John] Three...oh, my back! Hopefully getting that down is going to be Looking pretty good. I'm happy with the way it looks. I think I'm actually going to keep this [Sam] You liar! [John] Can you go up and grab my coat. Come on. All right, so, I feel like this is about right If we do this correctly, should be able to, [Jordan] What about here. [John] Oh, the 3-inches. You think that's going to make a difference. [Jordan] If it's not going to make a difference [John] One, I'm completely lost in what Two, I gotta have somewhere to mount our hidden So I mean it's not as cool if it's just It won't work that way. Maybe it will. Should I come out of here all the way down. Regardless, we need to break that right about size I want. Who wants to get creative with how we're So, to try and achieve a crack here that looks have no clue how to do this because it's So what I'm going to do is put a little it with a sledgehammer, obviously. This is gonna be awful. The amount of people that are going to complain to incredible. Guess how many people will complain in this can't get hardwood. [Sam] It's art, Mom, you wouldn't understand. [John] All right, shall we. [Sam] Oh, it split. I saw a split. [John] The other thing is, we don't really Put the bear paws on it. See how I said it was cut pretty straight. Dammit. [Sam] Go ahead. [John] We're making headway, I think. It looks like--it's kind of the profile I think another addition...there we go. Let's work on the other one. I'm essentially just, kind of like, trying I want it to look like it was a 2x4 in a tornado, Just kind of like hold it up. Look like a coat rack floating in the air? [Sam] You just look like two idiots holding Trust the process. [John] So we're getting squirrely because and my CNC operator is drunk. I'm going to drill a mortise hole for a We're going to use a dowel to put this into So Titebond makes this bungee tape stuff. I think that's what it's called. [Sam] Actually, I've no idea. [John] No idea, and we're going to use it So this majestic piece of art is looking majestic [Sam] Bless Art Rooney? [John] Rest easy. These things are pretty cool. Oops. I'll have a link in the description. These things are usually used for lashing You know, I think it's reusable a couple So, to make this illusion work, my vision And in the statue, which would be popping becomes the extension of the human element And the part that's missing, the bag connects So, to get a similar effect, I think I want to where it will loop around the outside. To do this, let's just try this. I'm a strong man. Nice. [Sam] Lay it on the grimiest surface in the [John] We need the coat to span the height Make sure when you guys are investing in your knee. Baby blacksmith. We should definitely do some blacksmithing I've been watching this Max Randolph guy, with him. All right, I'm going to weld a tab on here And then we gon' see if this thing works! No, we'll go mock. Conceptually, it actually looks like what [Sam] Let's do it. [John] Grab the jacket. I think it's going to have a little too I think we might have to adjust-- [Sam] There's also a ridiculous bump out [John] Well I wanted it to fill the hood, [Sam] Oh, it's really kind of weird looking. [John] Yeah? That was the intent. Now all we need is a little Halcyon Clear, Let us spray. What? This thing turned out pretty sweet. I think we captured what I was going for, For those of you who didn't know, this is I've got this little bar here. And this was a lot of fun.
