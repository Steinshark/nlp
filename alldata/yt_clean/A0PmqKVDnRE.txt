- We're back with our (bright music) Welcome aboard this 1999 Navigator 5300. We've shown you guys a So when we saw this listing, we thought we must show it to you. - [Rico] Okay. Let's start on - Okay. I think I'm sitting on a door. - [Rico] Yeah, you might want to. - Oh, it's a big door. - [Rico] And pull - [Rico] Wow. That's a big door. That's a very convenient - [Victoria] It's the almost - [Rico] Very, very convenient. - Yeah, I agree. - [Rico] Good size swim platform. I see the receptacles - Nice. - [Rico] Which is not on Then there I see there's a And what's this? - We have a transom shower. - [Rico] Anything else on this side? - There's also a water inlet. - [Victoria] Yeah, water fill. Thank you. That's what I was trying to say. These are nice actually, because if you coming onto the boat from the dock right here, this is really nice to grab onto. - [Rico] Very true. - [Rico] Okay. Turn around. Also all grab handles all along here. So if you are, you know, you can always grab onto something. - Does this have a a a cable reel? - [Rico] Yes. - [Rico] The remote for the cable reel. We have an additional inlet meaning internet for example. - Oh, nice. I think that's probably something we will not see much - Yeah. - [Rico] With all the - That's, yeah, that's All right. Welcome to So in case you guys are because obviously we We came up the staircase and Okay. That was really awkward, I love that they have this, I don't know if this was - [Rico] No. - [Victoria] You think it's really, - [Rico] I think that was original because that's your way - Oh, you are right. I love that. It's just so nice It really helps. So this is a totally an open Do anything you want. You can put a nice dining set here, do your al fresco dining here. You can have like a cool couch as well. - [Rico] Yeah. They have simple folding chairs here. You can totally like zhuzh So this is cool. Bigger That we have these, what are they called? - [Rico] Fairleads. these are not fairleads. You guys gimme... - [Rico] I know. - Can you put in the comments one time? I forgot again what they're called. There is a specific name for them. Can you educate everybody else? What are these called? Okay. - [Rico] Well your dock lines - Yes. - [Rico] Then we have a It looks like a sliding... - [Victoria] Show that. Oh yes, storage. - [Rico] And then what because the aft deck is covered - [Victoria] Yeah, these - [Rico] Yep. There's a hatch underneath, which we're gonna see of the tour from the engine room. So that's another access To the lazarette and engine room. Yes. - Okay. (bell rings) - [Rico] It is a quiet bell. - Yeah. I don't know if you Think they need a new bell. Possibly. Coming through, do you remember all the fog? - [Rico] Isn't that supposed Oh no, it's not that quiet. (bell rings) - [Rico] Okay. It works. Do you remember all the fog things? - [Rico] Sure. - [Rico] No, I know where to look them up. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. I know we don't get to use 'em too often. - [Rico] I'm getting warm. Let's go in... - [Victoria] Okay, fine. - [Rico] ...and check out the interior. - Let's go and show you the interior. (door slides) It's a little bit of cheating on this tour since we couldn't go all - [Rico] That's right because... - Because we get to have air conditioning. - [Rico] As you guys can see, It's full beam. - Yeah. So you get all this (blinder slides) - [Rico] Oh, they're So this one's open. This one open. - All of it. - [Rico] And oh, there are two windows. There's one behind the TV as well. - Exactly. So we have a salon Right? So technically if you you can just change it whatever you like. But actually a cute couch Somebody obviously enjoyed watching a TV. I feel like the TV used Could it be? - [Rico] Yep, a hundred percent. - Yeah. So this is now a bit more storage Also what you could do is put which will convert the like dine inside or outside you, you know, one of these like that I think are just a great. - [Rico] What I would do, I of these chairs and put - Oh you know, I like that too. - [Rico] To be honest. - That would be very cute as well. - [Rico] Right? And you can do like a one and use it as your ottoman and - [Rico] A hundred percent. - [Rico] And then it would but it's pretty cool. Look, 1999. But a complete open concept. - Yes. - Great windows as we mentioned But we'll get there in a moment. Let's check out some There's a little ice maker here. Look, it's even got a lock on it. Storage, storage, drawer underneath. Walk into the galley. Let's see here. All of these are drawers. Double sink, good size, nice window. If you would like to wash dishes and look out of the window. - Which you guys know I so I would probably find a way to get a little dishwasher into here, which you've got space for it. You could totally do I think this is a great amount You've got a three burner cooktop. We had a three burner cooktop, right? - [Rico] We had a three burner. - Which was plenty. Storage here. Got a little microwave right there. Got a fridge that was upgraded. Look, it's not a Norcold nor a hot fridge. - [Rico] No, this is - Definitely an upgrade. - Then Victoria's standing which we're gonna check out - Oh, it's right there. Got it. This is actually deep storage you guys. It goes all the way in Oh wait, found something else. What? This must have been - [Rico] Do you think it used to be a top loading fridge, maybe? - I think so, yeah. But now it's a nice storage All of these as well. Upper storage. It's a nice amount of that completely open feel I think they did this for safety reasons. Maybe a dog or a small kid. But it's a nice solution - [Rico] Just a clear glass. The boat brain. - [Rico] What's that? - [Victoria] I don't know but it's cute. It gives you, I guess all the systems, but I don't know if it's that made it, but it's - [Rico] Yeah, it's a - [Victoria] Ah, that's what it is. - [Rico] That is funny. And then we have an old remote - Ah. So you could turn Yep, it's right here. Another thing I found, which is cool is... - [Rico] Central vacuum. You know I used to be a big fan of that. Now I kind of feel like I'm moving away from that 'cause the vacuum cleaners are getting so small and powerful. - [Rico] Yeah. - But it is cool, cool feature to have. You just walk around with your hose and hey you have that on your yacht. See what we got here. - [Rico] Got an electrical switches, shorepower breakers and so on. - [Victoria] And another is that it is good ceiling height. - [Rico] Oh, very good. Yeah, it's nice. I mean... - [Rico] it's a very tall - It feels good if you're tall. - [Rico] So stepping up - [Victoria] A bit more storage. - [Rico] More storage. Okay. - Are we gonna pilot house - [Rico] Good question. - Hmm. Go out first and pilot house. - [Rico] Okay. - I think I need my glasses. They're just there. Forgot my glasses. - [Rico] Go get 'em. So we have this really that takes us out to our They also have a mosquito screen. - [Rico] Oh nice. - Could use that in Okay, this is interesting. - [Rico] So let me turn aft for a second so people can see what So there is a little bit of a You have the grab rail on top. So yes, you can still walk It is just not like a dedicated side deck like you would see on the, you know, some other motor yachts. We have a side gate here. - So yeah, if you will dock on this side, you can just come straight or bring in groceries So it's an interesting solution here. And coming forward to the bow. Ta-da. - Yeah, really good actually, so you can put some bean bags here. I think that's how we'd use it. You can also put a cushion here but I think a couple of You put it away. Keep the bow clean. - [Rico] Yeah. Forward hedge nicely covered to protect from the sun. - And that's also covered - Yeah. So we got the windlass here, which is covered the foot We have a water hookup right here. I don't know if it's sold or fresh, but there is a hookup right here. And then of course a searchlight - [Victoria] And a... - Come on. You can do it - [Rico] And a not a bow sprit. I forgot what it's called. - PP poo poo. A bow poo. - [Victoria] No, I don't - A bow pulpit. - Yes. Bow pulpit in the sailboat. - [Rico] Yep. - Okay, so this way we - [Rico] I don't think so. There was a window, but we still have a side - [Rico] Side boarding door. Yeah. - So that's nice. So you can actually do it on both sides. - [Rico] It's side boarding gate. - Actually, yeah, you're right. Okay, let's go back to - [Rico] And check the pilot house, right? - Yes. Okay. Perfect. Home office. - [Rico] Yeah. All these windows you can actually open. - [Rico] Yeah. As you guys can see here, like this one is open. - The way this space is connected is why I think this would because it's just such a great You can use all the spaces separately, but you just have this And if you could be in the you can have your coffee or I would totally work here. - [Rico] I think it's also because you have that pilot house set up. So you have the helm station right here and then with the seating and everybody really can hang out together. Like even underway. - Yeah, but that's what I mean. Like if you live and spend you are always together. - So you don't feel like there's sacrifice when you are at the helm and doing something else like... - [Rico] Well you do still have the upper helm on top of all that. - So don't give that all - [Rico] Okay. So you got the helm chair right here. Remote for the bow and Shift and throttle controls. VHF radio that looks pretty much original I believe with some old FURUNO equipment, actually, most likely. I almost bet some money on this still working perfectly fine. Analog gauges right These are Volvo Pentas, We got the throttle control here and shift control right here. So they're separate. We got Actually the panel that's a, you know, a little bit older looking one too, like that's the original for sure. Search light control and yeah, that's pretty much it Looks like somebody already for maybe a laptop or You can place right there - I mean you could put in - [Rico] Yeah. Put your - And kind of gives you time to wait to upgrade your electronics, you know, and just be able to use at the moment with like - [Rico] This is a nice space here. - Yeah. You even have it looks like an upgraded red light there. - [Victoria] Which is, you know, a nice setup for long crossings... - [Rico] And we have an - Exactly. And once you're gonna have a really nice cross breeze coming through here. Yeah. Love it. Does that mean we're going up? - [Rico] We going down to the into the do the flybridge - I think we're going up first. - [Rico] Sure? - [Rico] All right. - Because we always end up in - [Rico] Okay. Okay, let's go and (calm music) Huh? Okay, I see. - [Rico] Oh wow. That's a bigger flybridge than I expected actually. - Yeah. And this enclosure - [Rico] It is. So it's already ready to go. Yeah. The Bimini Great. Okay, where do we start? - [Rico] So starting aft, all the way on top here with a crane. With a davit, it's actually I wanna say the tender Looks like it roughly maybe 12 footer sitting on cradles here. So once that's back in the water, you actually have more and could even set up a - So then we have kind of a Could easily hang out here You have this table here, but I would probably up in for maybe like a high low table here or two tables? - [Rico] Or two separate ones. - Yeah. It would be kind of nice. - [Rico] Yeah, you could do that. - Yeah. But for now you And then there's a - [Rico] Yeah. When you're underway, hold on, before you get to the That's awesome. We have Drink fridge or a fridge, sink, grill and a bit of storage underneath. Nice. Everything you - [Rico] Visibility up here is fantastic. Like even if you are going you can see the entire side of the boat, very, very conveniently So this would be the spot I would say, I would definitely - [Victoria] For sure. - [Rico] No need to really use the lower one unless you're doing some super long crossing and you know... - Yeah. - [Rico] Have some crappy weather. So pretty much repeating what The helm wheel, Furuno chart plotter here, throttle control, horn switch, shift control here on the port side. And then we got our VHF radio, bow and stern gauges here, analog gauges. Our stop and start button Windlass control. And that's Got some trim taps here and the searchlight right over there. - If you're wondering why they haven't replaced the 1999 FURUNO. That's probably because - [Rico] Yeah, probably - Because it's FURUNO. (Victoria and Rico chuckle) - Okay. - We are gonna go down and the state rooms. - But before that, I you guys know that we and we don't charge So every tour you see on this because we think it would be something you guys would enjoy watching.
