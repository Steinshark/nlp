[CAR ENGINE ROARING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Drivers, before the big race, you are each going to set a lap Oh, look at this. Emelia: Each vehicle has its own line These cars and drivers each have different advantages So, we've built a custom racetrack and see which one comes out on top. I have to do the long lap? You have a formula one car. WOMAN:The F1 car's extreme speed so we'll challenge it to run PATRICK: I'm ready for it. -You want to go first? -All right, let's do this. Emelia: Before the head to head race, each vehicle will set a lap time The F1 car will rocket past 180mph What time will it set [CAR ENGINE ROARING] Emelia: When it comes each of these vehicles The RB7 Formula one car is engineered to have advanced aerodynamics that keeps it glued to the track. This allows it to carry more speed, MAD MIKE: He's got He does. That's right. MAD MIKE: And the sound [CAR ENGINE ROARING] SCOTT SPEED: Oh, my. MAD MIKE: I'm glad he's got Emelia :Yeah, your guys' track Don't tell me you guys Emelia: That silence speaks volumes. [CAR ENGINE ROARING] It sounds so good. SCOTT:This last corner Hopefully it's close enough race that we all kind of because it would just make MAD MIKE:Different layouts, on the last turn. [CAR ENGINE ROARING] Engineer: Okay. Nice job mate. If you want to bring it back PATRICK:Okay, copy. I think these guys are starting but that's what we're here for. He's got a long ass track We've got a couple of shortcuts Emelia: The F1 car set a 1:20. Can the drift car match this time to make it in the final race? If I go off the track, I'm stuck there with the gators and everything else Emelia: Mad Mike will need to drift and maintain speed. The faster the better his time will be. I think Mike's biggest struggle is going to be getting it off [CAR ENGINE REVVING] PATRICK:There he goes. [CAR ENGINE ROARING] Oh, that is cool. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] SCOTT:Oh my God. Emelia: Hell, yeah. PATRICK:That has to be hairy. Emelia: He wants to be sideways SCOTT:Mike has to go around creating smoke and show. We can just go fast. PATRICK:Tires are gonna be gone, no. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Emelia: With a rear-wheel drive setup, this McLaren is a master Come on, Mike. Go! ANDREW CARLSON: Last lap. Emelia: It's close. Emelia: The drift car an extra second in the final race MAD MIKE:We're going I don't know Yeah, 'cause the more you slide out, So, do you want to look cool? What's the balance? That's the story of my life, Emelia: The Rallycross car has the fastest acceleration It hits 60mph in under two seconds. It can go off road to cut corners. Can it match the 120 benchmark [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [CAR ENGINE ROARING] Send it. Emelia: He's booking. [CAR ENGINE ROARING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, mate, look at that. MAD MIKE:He's definitely [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Emelia: The Rallycross car is 1:20:56. If the truck can match this lap time, Andrew's Pro4 truck has the greatest suspension It can jump over the track He has the shortest distance, but will he cross Emelia: You can see from the second it takes off. Look at it. That looks nuts. Emelia: Oh. Emelia: Oh my God! SCOTT:Oh, that jumped sweet. PATRICK:We are going Well you are. You got no roof. You're gonna get covered in mud. Emelia: There's no question is the king of suspension Dude, look at that thing go. Emelia: Oh, man, that thing boogies. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] MAD MIKE:This jump is sweet. Look, it's got a big Emelia: He's got to have the biggest MAD MIKE:And then watch SCOTT SPEED: PATRICK:Into the mud. PATRICK:Oh my God. MAD MIKE:Sick. Man, I wanna swap jobs. That looks fun. Talk about off road. Emelia: No other car and jumps Andrew can take Emelia: What time? SCOTT:A 1:20? MAD MIKE:Really? MAD MIKE:Well, I'm so stoked. PATRICK:Come on. Is there a knob in there? Man, I'm fricking-- MAD MIKE:The only thing I can do is just smoke the whole track so there's no room for passing. Emelia: As it stands now, yes or no? Do you think It's going to be a fair race. -Yeah. Yeah. It's gonna be good. Emelia: The race lines are set. Who will cross the line first [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [CAR ENGINE ROARING] Emelia: The F1 car way up front. We have Scott Speed in P2 right now. Mad Mike in P3. The truck with the fastest lap time [CAR ENGINE ROARING] Emelia: It may look like the F1 car but he has a longer track It's going to be really close. [CAR ENGINE ROARING] Emelia: This is close. [CAR ENGINE ROARING] Emelia: This is gonna be a close one. Oh my God. [LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] And the winner is Mad Mike in P1. Oh.
