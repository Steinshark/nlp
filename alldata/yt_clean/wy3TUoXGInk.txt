(He managed to finish the morning run.) Let me pray for a moment. (Please save me.) Okay. (Joon Ho, you worked hard.) I got something for you. - Carbonated drink with protein. What's that? You must eat protein after doing cardio. Some people can't eat regular protein. So I got this for you. - I'll open it. (Well-mannered with drinks) Thank you. It's quite good. It goes down smoothly.

Before I got close to him, I wondered if he really does that - But he really is like that. He's been doing it for a very long time. He really is like that. Not long ago, he came to my company to hang out. He said he was in Gangnam... and wanted to come if I was at the office. I was like, &quot;I'm about to go in.&quot; He said, &quot;I'll be in Gangnam It's not common to stay in Gangnam... between 2 p.m and 3:20 p.m. He's always so detailed. PSY. - Jin Young is a close friend. - And Rain. You guys are as passionate as Si Won. Among PSY, Park Jin Young, and Rain, who do you think is too passionate? - Jin Young. I think so too. I think he's the most passionate Asian... I've ever met. He has so many routines. If he starts learning Japanese, If he starts exercising, He has his own rules and routines. You might know it well, - but on an audition show, he has this facial expression He also does it (He also does it We were eating at a restaurant. And his favorite song came out. It was just the two of us. And he asks if I know the song. But let's say I don't know the song. &quot;I've never heard this song.&quot; Then he's like, - Welcome. There's a nice quote here.

(The wealthy life isn't easy.) I'm sweating speaking in English. We just saw how Si Won spends his day. How do you spend yours? First of all, I pretty much I go to work every day. - I do. Often times during the weekend, I'm the only one in the entire building. Do you just go there on the weekends (He suspects PSY.) Maybe you want some alone time... away from your kids and your wife. Maybe you're going there Not at all. I really don't like it, but I tend to be busier on the weekends. - It's not what you think. when it's completely empty. Every weekend, I realize (Pursuing music is a lonely journey.) He styles... - his own hair. From what I know, he uses a ton of hair gel. I heard it took a while too. Has that changed at all? I'm still styling my own hair. - This is for self-contentment. Whenever I release a new album, all the staff members' names For example, the music video director. I always write &quot;Park Jai Sang&quot; - That's your real name. - You wrote your real name. I always write that. - Do you still use that hair gel? - Goodness. - Yes. How long does it take? Since I'm an amateur, it's pretty quick on a good day. This pointy part is the most important. It takes ages on days - This angle... - Right. - There's this angle I like. It's hard to explain. I do this at the very end. When the tips are looking up, - On a good day, it looks nice. This angle is what matters the most to me. It's for self-contentment. I always style my own hair, - and I like to raise it a bit. This part. Unless I'm attending the awards ceremony, I always leave this part up. Others may disagree. Are you like me? On days when you can't get it right, - I do. - It just doesn't feel right. (The flowers have bloomed this spring.) Gosh. Where is that? (The flowers have bloomed this spring.) (There are many flowers...) (on the rooftop studio.) Hold on. Let's think about this. (It's Sang Min and Bakgoon.) All right. I like the idea. I didn't know you liked flowers. To be frank... Did I buy too many? I ordered 600 of them. Do we need to plant them all? - But this is... Yes. The pots. - So... - Six hundred of them? Six hundred? - Even if I hired others... A pot has around 10 flowers, Right. Actually, it's more than that. How about we just make a heart... out of the pots instead of planting them? Instead of planting them? Don't you think that'll lack sincerity? Well... (What are they trying to do?) I proposed with one rose. It just didn't seem right. Then the pots... (It may not have been anything big,) (but he sincerely proposed with a rose.) (He moved her heart with his sincerity.) There was no problem but my friends yelled at me so much. - They said I shouldn't do that. He's going to propose to her today. I see. Do we have to plant 600? One by one. There are many other ways. - Yes. various ways. - Some were already on TV. This is like you. This is so like you. (Bakgoon goes with 600 plants.) You need to plan it first. Yes. Over there. I want to make a flower path. A flower path? So she can walk the flower path. And flowers here too. After the flower path, she stands here, and she'll see a heart. I'll draw the heart Then it will be a heart shape. And in the center, I will plant a flower and... You're excited. I will plant a flower and... (He's so excited.) - Let's make the heart first. - Be careful. - Let's move them. Let's get started. Let's move them first... - Let's try. Here. (He starts moving the plants one by one.) We need flowers for the path. You don't need them in between. - Maybe one. - And one here. - That's the start. Let's start digging. It's finally working. (It's finally working with your help.) - Like this. - Dig a line. (They dig the ground.) (Move the flower from the pot...) (and plant it.) - Along the line. - Dig a line first. (They plant flowers one by one.) (Enthusiastic) How did you come up with this idea? I moved out yesterday. This rooftop house is... my first house in Seoul. I told the landlady... that I want to propose to her No other place is better than this. I... - moved in here... and things turned out well. You have a lot of memories here. Yes. (Two years ago, Here? (They first went to a basement.) (Satisfied) (The second house was on top of the hill.) This is a lot better. (Happy) - My goodness. - The old house. - I've watched that episode. (They went to see many houses.) (And they finally found his first home.) (It was his first house in Seoul.) Yun Jung. (Many people visited the rooftop studio.) (Time he spent with his friends) (And...) (It made him miss his mom so much.) We weeded the lawn in the rain. Things turned out well Yes. You found this place for me. Things turned out well. It's nice to see It's very nice. I felt bad for him. Things went well. Now, you're going to say goodbye and start a new beginning. (Like his first day here,) (he spends his last day here (Working hard) (Screaming) - My goodness. What's wrong? What? I stepped on the hoe. - My goodness. Be careful. You... You've become weak. You pretend to be in pain. There's a hole in the shoe, You used to step on that on purpose. (You used to step on that on purpose.) You're screaming now. I'm not alone anymore. I need to take care of myself. I also sprained my waist. I sprained my waist from hoeing. - Right. He's become weak. Now, he has someone (The crybaby groom and Sang Min Gosh. (Working hard) (Concentrating) Gosh. (They plant 600 flowers quietly (Exerting) That's a lot of pressure on his waist. (Panting) Planting 600 flowers... isn't easy. (Thank you so much, Sang Min.) (Panting) (Panting) (Panting) Come on. - &quot;Come on&quot;? Yes. My goodness. (It happens to be very sunny.) (Panting) (Inhaling) (Grunting) (I think I've been digging (But there are still a lot left.) (Is he tired?) You see, now we have a lot of members. Yes. Why... did you ask me? (Why did you pick me?) Sang Min is I agree. - That's what I was thinking. - why he's helping him. Done. It looks nice. - It looks nice. We're not even halfway done, (There are still a lot of flowers left.) - Done. (They keep planting flowers.) (Getting up) (Feeling dizzy) (Soaked) Let me take a break for a minute. (Staggering) (Staggering) - Are you okay? It's tight. (Grabbing) (He picked up a flower from the ground.) What are you going to do with that? To read my fortune with the flower. (Read his fortune with the flower?) Read his fortune? This year, I will... meet the one. I won't meet the one. He's doing that? Yes. No. No. Yes. No. Yes. No. Yes. No. No. (Does he not have a chance this year?) He's disappointed. He said... &quot;won't&quot; instead of &quot;can't&quot; (Let's just plow the ground.) (Panting) (Grunting) Sorry? Nothing. It was just my breathing. - Won Hee. - Won Hee. I'm sorry I'm late. - Won Hee came too. I'm sorry I'm late. From Gangneung? - Did you have a shoot there? You're naturally walking down... - the flowery path. Goodness. You made this? I can't walk down this path? Sang Min helped with this. You just made it? - Yes. What are you going to do with it? - Yes, you're right. Okay, then. He called me for lunch. That wasn't it? You called me to make me work? - We must plant them all. - You made a path. She'll come in this way, and come to the heart shape We'll be making a heart shape? And you'll be standing there? - No, my bride will. I'll make her stand here. Why did you ask us of all people? (Why did you ask us of all people?) (What's wrong with you guys?) Then when is your bride coming? In about two hours. - Then we need to hurry. We should hurry. What should I do? Can you just remove the flowers Just remove the flowers from the pots. That's not hard at all. Okay. Let's do it. Just pass the flowers over to me. (They divide their roles This is all useless. This is all useless. (Suddenly getting upset) What's the point of proposing? You guys helped me out so much, so I must live happily. Of course. I'll live happily no matter what. Who didn't have that dream? Bakgoon invited when he could've invited others. But he invited on such a good day. (You should be happy, at least.) (Heave-ho.) (Panting) (Panting) (They've been planting flowers (Panting) For such events, the chairman should volunteer He always has excuses like blepharoptosis. He got that surgery - Yes. On a day like today He had to get surgery (Sang Min is right.) (Won Hee does his job quietly.) This is... Wait. Let me remove each petal... and see if I'll be able And see if I'll be able He's doing what Sang Min did earlier. - My gosh. The sad mid-aged men think the same. They all think alike. And see if I'll be able - But... - I did it earlier. Let me try it too. Should I start with &quot;yes&quot; first? Also, it's not about It's if you can or cannot get married. It's not that you won't. Right. It's whether I can I still haven't got it together. - What about him? Sang Min went with the other one. This is so nerve-racking. (It was for me too.) Marriage. I can get married. I can't get married. I can get married. I can't get married. (He removes the petals one by one I can get married. I can't get married. I can get married. I can't get married. (I won't be the only one I can get married. I can't get married. I can get married. I can't get married. I can get married. (It says I can't get married.) This is driving me crazy. Will he get to see someone new this year? - Or won't he? - Will he? Won't he? - Will he? Won't he? (Is he doing that for me?) - Will he? Won't he? - Will he? Won't he? (Focused) - Will he? Won't he? - Will he? Won't he? (Will he? Won't he?) - He will! (Jang Hoon will get to meet Congratulations! Finally. I'm not sure... if it's something to celebrate. Still, both Sang Min and Won Hee... - didn't have luck. Compared to the two of them, I'm quite lucky. - You're right. They're very unlucky. (It says I can't get married.) No, this is all superstitious. Forget it. No, it's not true. I won't believe it. We got it. I'll shovel away the soil. Take the flowers out (The rooftop garden That's a lot of work. (After 3 hours of working...) (The garden is filled Is there anything else we can use Is there... Wouldn't it look too empty Shouldn't we place candles too? Don't they usually place candles? Making a flowery path itself Stop thinking like that. Let's just think about that. I want the proposal (I'm grateful that you're helping me Is there anything else? I think there could be. It's a little lacking. There's no highlight. Is there anything else? - You keep making us stop working. - Let's get back to it. Shouldn't there be something else? Never mind. (Let's just plant the flowers first.) If we stay until the evening, can we stay here for your proposal? - It doesn't matter if you stay. No, we should leave. Why would you stay to watch that? Right? It's fun. It'd be nice. (He's silly.) (Just go home.) - Here. Yes, I did. This is... What kind of ring is it? I'm just curious. Is it a gold ring? (Laughing) - It's a gold ring. Is it 14K or 18K? (Asking nosily) What matters is the 600 pots not the ring. It doesn't matter whether the ring (I'm just excited.) Actually, I gave her the ring, but I took it back... without her knowing. What is that? - I just... (Proposals are important.) (His proposal is coming soon.) (With their hard work, the garden (The mid-aged man who said It's heavy. (And the mid-aged man The heart is so pretty without flowers. I told you. (The heart shape is pretty visible now.) They're amazing. (Impressed) There's only soil in the heart, right? - Yes. Come on. You should've brought something then! I think something is lacking. - It's... We can say we should use I thought of using gold dust. - It should go like this. - We don't have much time, right? Actually, - Go ahead. Okay. Go ahead and write it. I think we can finish two more racks. Let's use them all. (Working hand-in-glove) (Perfect teamwork) It looks like we do this for a living. (It looks like they plant flowers Why are we so good at it? We suit it so much. It's not even awkward. - I know. Why does it suit us so much? They're working so hard. (The heart-shaped garden (thanks to their expert-like skills.) You should think of something. - There should be more. Why do you keep giving up? - We must do something more. I just want him to live well. This is good enough! No, this isn't enough. We might regret it - Why would we regret it? We did our best. I know we did, but... It looks pretty good, right? (The empty rooftop garden...) (turned into a flower garden - Oh, my. - It does look pretty. What is this? A banner? - Yes, Won Hee. - It'll look nicer with it. We must hang this too. We should. (You're hanging that now?) - Oh, no. - It's way too big. (A huge banner) - Which way? - I got it in the wrong size. (Fluttering) It's too big. - It's so windy too. I think this is the highlight. - You should tie it. Tie it to the top. Later... Oh, no. When we eat... Just tie it to the top first! I hung it. - No, you should... Can't you see a nail there?
