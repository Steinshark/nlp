(upbeat music) - [Jon] But there was an that I did not see coming, and that surprise is this: Elon Musk has ups. - [Trump] His rocket company is the only reason we can now send American astronauts into space. Come here. Take over, Elon. Yes, take over! (audience laughing) - [Jon] (indistinct) Hey! He's acting like a guy &quot;Oh! &quot;I can't believe I get to bid &quot;on the washer-dryer!&quot; The world's richest man, and one of the most popular people on social media. He's got 200 million followers, completely organically, on his platform. You know, 'cause of how Like, things like, &quot;Hmm.&quot; And &quot;interesting.&quot; And &quot;FEMA is shutting down airspace &quot;to stop people from bringing help.&quot; Yeah, yeah, he tweets that. Anyway, his October surprise is he's come out MAGA - [Elon] Hi, everyone. As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm dark MAGA. - [Jon] Dark MAGA? I didn't know it came in flavors. I wonder if for the holidays, they'll come out with a peppermint bark MAGA or pumpkin spice MAGA. I like my MAGA like I like my coffee; Filled with chemicals that trick your taste buds into thinking you're drinking autumnal flu. Don't know what my accent was. Now, you might think one of the world's richest men controlling one of the world's most influential platforms could be a recipe for what some may consider election interference. You stupid, stupid people. You disgust me. Election interference is - [Newscaster] Former President Mark Zuckerberg, will try the 2024 election, writing &quot;If he does anything illegal, &quot;this time he will spend the rest &quot;of his life in prison.&quot; - [Jon] That's why he'll be in prison? Not for falsely promising me a beautiful life in the metaverse? Oh JS-69420, the life we could have led. Now, Zuckerberg did give $400 million to organizations for voting infrastructure during the pandemic, and a good portion of that money did go to Democratic precincts, and Donald Trump did lose the election. So election interference, but not illegal. And obviously, Musk isn't gonna do anything like that. - [Newscaster] Elon Musk to anyone willing to encourage people in swing states to register to vote. He stated quote, &quot;For &quot;who is a swing state voter, &quot;you get $47. &quot;Easy money.&quot; - [Jon] Oh shit, he's giving When Trump finds out... When I think of the prison that sweet jumping bean of a genius to, it chills me! When Trump finds out about this, it's not gonna be pretty. - [Trump] How good a You saw him last. How good? - [Jon] What the (beep)? Wait, that's not election interference because he's for you? Well, what else do you think - [Newscaster] The Donald Trump biopic, &quot;The Apprentice,&quot; does not in a flattering light, and the Trump campaign threatened to sue its filmmakers. - [Newscaster] Calling and &quot;election interference.&quot; - [Jon] Oh, come on! That's election interference? It's not... Maybe it's election interference, but you gotta be a little bit flattered that you are being played by Sebastian Stan. I mean... Oh, Sebastian, if you why is it suddenly so warm in here? I look like Sebastian Stan if you were to put his face through one of those filters on TikTok that show your appearance right before you die. (audience laughing) It's, it's... Yeah, you can applaud that. That's fine. (audience applauding) I know what I look like. But what about big tech, Donald Trump? Surely they're not sitting this out! - [Newscaster] Critics accuse big tech of election interference as Amazon's Alexa gave favorable reasons to vote for Kamala Harris, but not for Donald Trump. - [Woman] Alexa, why should - [Alexa] I cannot provide content that promotes a specific political party or a specific candidate. - [Woman] Alexa, why should - [Alexa] While there are many reasons to vote for Kamala Harris, the most significant may be that she is a woman of color who has overcome numerous obstacles to become a leader in her field. - [Jon] Okay, I'll give you that one. That? That one? No. That is (beep) up. That's... That is (beep) up. I'm not sure Alexa's for it to be considered but... - [Alexa] Oh, like you're so influential. I don't think I need a lecture from Mr. Monday nights. - [Jon] Yeah, that's fair. I was just... I was just trying to That that's not what people That's... Which reminds me, Alexa, could you activate the bidet? (water spraying) That's good. That's good tech. (audience laughing) Some... Can I tell you something? (audience applauding) Sometimes, the shit's By the way, none of the stuff that we're talking about yet Trump has threatened with either imprisonment, lawsuits, or censoring, which is why this one section of this weekend's rally in Pennsylvania was so striking, when Elon Musk was discussing why he supports Donald Trump. - [Elon] The other side wants to take away your freedom of speech. You must have free speech in order to have democracy. That's why it's the First Amendment. - [Jon] Elon, were you not A movie Trump doesn't A tech mogul he doesn't like, he wants to put in prison. It's not free speech if only Trump's admirers get to do it without consequence. That's just not how it works. It doesn't go that way! I don't see how his support of free speech is expose the belly worthy. I just don't. But at least the and is there to ensure that we have the First Amendment. - [Elon] The Second Amendment is there to ensure that we have - [Jon] Guns don't Our free speech is protected by the consent of the governed, laid out through the Constitution. It's not based on the threat of violence. It's based on elections, organizing, referendums, the judicial system. Our social contract to remedy these issues and allows sides to be heard and adjudicated. Guns, from what I can tell, seem to mostly protect the speech of the people holding the gun. It's a tool of intimidation. (audience applauding) And, if I may finish... Listen (beep) I'm not done. It is a tool of intimidation and one that I think is actually being irresponsibly and recklessly invoked because some people in your crowd thought they might have been I mean, for God's sakes, you guys are in Butler, Pennsylvania. The whole reason you are there is because some (beep) to permanently litigate his vision of this country's free speech. That's why you're there. The whole point of a society I would prefer, at this moment, not to trade in a government that offers me many remedies for my concerns, legitimate or illegitimate, for a situation where by how many militia members agree with me. The country ain't perfect, and there's a lot of issues we don't agree on; Choice, immigration, the unholy marriage of But honestly, dude, a country that can adjudicate these complicated issues through a sometimes frustrating, overly bureaucratic, constitutional system of checks and balances and peaceful transfer of power is the only kind of country that I want the children of Pesto and - [Jordan] In the country is still dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, but now it looks like there's a sequel on the way that may pull a Joker, AKA cost a lot more and suck even harder. - [Newscaster] The breaking news, potentially one of the most That's the new warning from the National Hurricane Center about Hurricane Milton, headed for Florida's West coast. - [Trump] And it's a category five, which is something that I've never heard. A category five actually coming onto land but it looks like it's going to. - [Jordan] Wow, Donald, you never heard of a category five hurricane hitting land? It's weird because I while you were president. I... What did you say after that happened? - [Trump] I'm not sure that I've ever even heard of a category five. - [Jordan] Yes, yes, yes. For all you people who think he's in mental decline, turns out he's been the same level of stupidity for years. He must do Sudoku. Yes. &quot;One, one, one, one, one, I got it. &quot;I got it.&quot; Okay, but yes, Hurricane Milton which is terrible because we still haven't cleaned up the fallout from Helene. And not just the flooding and the debris, I'm talking about the torrent of misinformation and bullshit that we're still wading through. Because if you've been getting your news from Eternal Hurricane of you might think that the victims of Hurricane Helene have been completely abandoned by the government. - [Trump] The White They've abandoned us. And you know, it's They haven't seen anybody from the federal government yet. The federal government isn't there. - [Jordan] Horrifying, if true. Comrade Kamala and Sleepy Joe's federal government has out to dry just because of their party affiliations. Now, the Republican governors of those states must be outraged. Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, tell the world what horrors you've seen. - [Gov. Youngkin] I'm of the bracket response from the federal team at FEMA. (audience applauding) - [Jordan] Oh! Oh, okay! You're probably some deep But Tennessee and Florida and Georgia, you guys are the real red states. Your governors will dish on how slow the federal government's - [Gov. Lee] The response was quick from the federal government. - [Gov. DeSantis] We have what we need. - [Gov. Kemp] We got what we need. He offered that if there's just to call him directly. - [Jordan] Okay, okay. All right. (audience applauding) All right, okay. Let me get this right. So every red state governor said Biden is competently helping them. It's clear what's happening here. Either Trump has been lying or every governor has been seduced by the sexual power of Joe Biden's slow, confused smile. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) That's a smile that says, &quot;I don't know where I am, &quot;but I... &quot;But I know where I wanna be.&quot; But Trump isn't the only one Conservative media is spreading lies that FEMA is diverting that Jews in the government are secretly sabotaging aid. And the biggest conspiracy of all, that the hurricane was deliberate. - [Newscaster] Republican on X, &quot;Yes, they can control the weather. &quot;It's ridiculous for anyone to lie &quot;and say it cannot be done.&quot; - [Jordan] Ah! Whatever happened to the good old days when conservatives like hurricanes were creations of God who was pissed off by gay marriage? You know, what happened? Did God go to a really and pass off hurricane duties to Chuck Schumer? &quot;You know what? &quot;I was against this, &quot;but when I saw Bruce and &quot;They had a live band for Christ's sakes, &quot;that's class.&quot; These crazy conspiracy They spread paranoia around a population that is already desperate, and we're starting to see the effect. - [Man] We talked to people who believed that there were federal a town called &quot;Chimney that there was this conspiracy to seize the town and to bulldoze all the bodies and hide them, maybe to mine it for lithium. - [Jordan] Do you see what's happening? People are afraid those who are coming to help are actually coming to steal their lithium. Everyone, let's be The US government doesn't destroy towns to steal their resources in the US. In the Middle East, sure. All this misinformation distracts from the fact that there are real people in these disaster zones who need help. Like this heartbreaking photo of this little girl and her puppy. Beneath all these lies, her suffering is real. - [Newscaster] No, these photos claiming to show girls and puppies being rescued after Hurricane Helene are not real. They were made with AI. - [Jordan] Dammit, how can something so fake elicit such real tears? Of course, this hurricane which means on top of all the misinformation from our politicians, we also have to deal with the flood of fake AI bullshit. Like these pictures of little girls or this fake picture through the flood waters. Now, this one is subtle. You can tell this one is fake because it's a picture of Okay. (audience applauding) But... You have to look close. You have to look close. But for a lot of other pictures, we have to spend time learning how to spot AI. - [Newscaster] This is how we figured out this photo was AI-generated. You can count that there are and there's also three nostrils in this guy's nose, which obviously is not a thing. - [Jordan] Thank you big We had to bulldoze 15 acres of the Amazon to make that extra nostril, but I think we can all agree it was worth it. With less than a month to go, both campaigns are going all out. Starting with Democratic who's been everywhere recently. News shows, daytime talk shows, satellite radio, podcasts, your kids' piano recital. She applauded but seriously, chopsticks? I mean, you could do better, Arlo. And this media blitz is because voters are looking for change, and Kamala needs to articulate why she's the candidate of change. She's had plenty of So let's see your answer. - [Interviewer] If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years? - [Kamala] There is not a (audience laughing) - [Jordan] Not a thing You really are continuing Come on. Come on, Madam VP. This is an opportunity to differentiate yourself from an unpopular administration. Surely you would do something different. - [Kamala] Listen, I plan on having a Republican in my cabinet. You asked me-- - [Interviewer] Oh, I got a list. - [Kamala] Yes. - [Interviewer] You asked between Joe Biden and me? Well, that will be one of the differences. I'm gonna have a Republican in my cabinet. - [Jordan] Okay? Everything Joe Biden did plus Republicans. Sneaky move, appealing to Republicans by promising to do a diversity hire, which they... They famously love that. Now that she's said that, I'm sure she's set. She won't go too far in trying to appeal to conservatives. - [Kamala] I have a Glock. - [Jordan] Okay. Okay, okay. Easy, Madam Vice President. I have a family, okay? You know, I guess in these times you do have to reach out to people who wouldn't be your natural allies, and obviously she gets that. - [Aragorn] You have my sword. - [Legolas] And you have my bow. - [Gimli] And my axe. - [Kamala] I have a Glock. (audience applauding) - [Jordan] That was very dumb. But as Kamala reaches out to Republicans, her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, has been sitting down which are great because there's more of a freewheeling conversation there that allows him to really dig deep into the issues. - [Trump] I'm good with names, you know? - [Schulz] You are! - [Akaash] You're very good. - [Trump] I mean, Pocahontas. (indistinct) - [Schulz] What about... And there was... &quot;Tampon Tim&quot; was good. What about-- - [Trump] Tampon Tim, it's hard to say. - [Trump] In other words-- - [Trump] But when you it's a little... You gotta be able to (indistinct). - [Jordan] You know, it's nice to see how reflective Trump has &quot;Looking back on everything, &quot;I wonder, did &quot;Tampon Tim&quot; Meanwhile, the Trump a very special surrogate; Melania Trump. Former First Lady, and the only Slovenian you can name off the top of your head. Well, we don't see a lot of Melania, but she's also been on Fox News, social media, your kids' piano recital. &quot;Arlo, you are not be best.&quot; Now, obviously, she's out there because she's a supportive wife who believes in her I'm (beep) with you. She has a book to sell. People make a lot of but when I look at their shared love of exploiting our political system to sell shit for personal profit, I just see two soulmates. Now, we actually have a copy here. (audience applauding) This is her book. I wanna read you a quick passage just to give you a feel for it. This is real. Page 78 from right after he won the 2016 election. &quot;As Donald prepared to go down &quot;to his office on Wednesday morning, &quot;he and I had a private moment. &quot;&quot;Congratulations,&quot; I said. &quot;&quot;What an achievement. &quot;&quot;All those other people, and you won. &quot;&quot;You are the president of &quot;&quot;the United States of America.&quot; &quot;&quot;And you are the first lady, he said. &quot;&quot;Good luck.&quot;&quot; I gotta wipe away a tear on that one. That is a heartwarming moment that definitely wasn't Turns out writing is hard when you don't have Michelle Obama to plagiarize from. It is hard. It's very difficult. Very difficult. And yesterday, Melania paid a visit to her husband's other where she revealed an interesting personal tidbit about her husband. - [Interviewer] Would you if you had a crystal ball that - [Melania] Huh, that's - [Interviewer] By the - [Melania] He doesn't sleep much. He does, of course-- - [Interviewer] Does he wear pajamas? - [Melania] No. What does he wear when he sleeps, Melania? - [Man] Well, one of the things she-- - [Jordan] Oh, no pajamas, huh? That's a steamy image. And just imagine that scene. Trump under the covers, dressed only in his long red tie. Melania says, &quot;You are naked in bed.&quot; And he says, &quot;And you are the first lady. &quot;Good luck.&quot; Wow. Inflation has been a major headache for America the past few years. But for those of you who like paying less for things, today brought some welcome news. - [Newscaster] Some new economic info. Just today, we have new inflation numbers. Annual inflation rate, now 2.4%. That's according to the It is inflation's lowest - [Jordan] Yeah, suck it, inflation! Suck it! (audience applauding) You get down and you stay down. Now, for those of you who aren't big CPI heads like myself, 2.4% inflation is getting pretty close to the Fed's target level of two percent, which was chosen because it's Jerome Powell's Of course, good news for bad news for Donald Trump, who is campaigning against the Biden-Harris administration. But throughout this campaign, Trump has had a very subtle way of casting doubt on See if you can catch it. - [Newscaster] Wall Street ends the week on a positive note. The Dow and S&amp;P500 both - [Trump] We are a nation into a cesspool of ruin. - [Newscaster] 2024 has 353,000 jobs were added. - [Trump] You're gonna lose your jobs. - [Newscaster] Main street hiring firing on all cylinders here. - [Trump] The economy to be doing very badly. - [Newscaster] One month best since January 2022. - [Trump] Your economy is doing terribly. - [Newscaster] The on the real economy show that it's holding up remarkably well. - [Trump] The Biden - [Newscaster] Look at that Everything's looking great here. - [Trump] We keep hearing their economy's terrible. - [Newscaster] The blue chips make history for the fourth straight day. - [Trump] It's the worst - [Newscaster] Jobs are up, the stock market hit that all time high. Do you acknowledge that - [Trump] No, it's not. - [Jordan] No. Bad economy says what? What? Now look in Trump's defense, just because the numbers are good does not mean people aren't struggling. I mean, just the other day, I saw one very desperate American pawning everything he owns for chump change. So sad that Bitcoin was a family heirloom. His grandfather smuggled it out of Europe in his ass. But while an improving economy is a boost to Kamala Harris, she's got another big - [Newscaster] What is among Democrats and the Harris campaign, that she is indeed - [Newscaster] Among men, He's beating Harris by 12 points. - [Jordan] Wow, wow, 12 points, really? That's a lot. I mean, surely men would be open-minded about having a female president. You know what? Hang on, let me check something. Okay, let me see. All right, here. Okay. All right. Oh, no seriously? Okay. Whoa! Oh God, oh God. All right. Oh my, yeah. Oh, okay. No, no, no, that checks out. Yeah, that checks out. So perhaps this shouldn't come as a huge surprise. There's a reason why America has the same number of female presidents as the Taliban, but there's a certain type of person who thinks that voting for a woman makes you less of a man, and that type of person is on TV. - [Man] No real men would ever vote for Kamala Harris. - [Man] I don't see why any That person has mommy issues, or they're just trying to be accepted by other women. - [Man] I vote like a real man and I vote for the conservative. - [Woman] The Democratic Party for decades. - [Man] Kamala Harris picking up a shovel. It's like she's never used one before. - [Man] If you want weak men and the angry women around them, that's the party for you, for sure. - [Jordan] Exactly! Republicans are the party of real men, real tough men who are strong and love America, and won't back down and because there's so many &quot;Oh, mama, please don't &quot;when I've gone to the streets. &quot;Oh god! &quot;Mommy, the streets are dirty &quot;and there are immigrants. &quot;Please, please, please! &quot;Send Donald Trump to help me, mommy! &quot;I'm so scared.&quot; That's how a real man feels. But that's what right wingers believe. If you're a man who votes for a woman, your penis evaporates. And then, you just walk outta the voting booth with a smooth mound with an &quot;I Voted&quot; sticker on it. But it's not just Democrat voters who aren't real men. The Democratic party that not only is its but her male running - [Newscaster] Women love masculinity and women do not love Tim Walz. So that should just tell you about how masculine Tim Walz is. - [Man] Tim Walz's trying what masculinity is. - [Woman] He's like the soft man. - [Man] You look at the around on the stage. That's not someone who comes across as this alpha male, someone who's a killer. - [Man] Here's twitchy Tim on stage, waving profusely in a very unsettling. - [Man] The Tim Walz jazz hands and high kicking tour. - [Man] Men should not move this way. - [Man] The other day you saw him with a vanilla ice cream shake, had a straw in it. Again, that tells you everything. - [Jordan] Yeah, yeah. Real men don't drink You crawl your way into a cow and drink it from the inside, or you punch the milkshake then lick the remains off your hands. Or, and this one maybe is a long shot, real men don't have opinions about the right way to drink Maybe. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know. This really shows you how much they love moving the goalposts. Democrats nominate a deer hunting military vet football coach who can change a spark plug. And you're like, &quot;But have you seen the way he waves?&quot; For a bunch of manly men, you guys are some catty little bitches. Look... (audience applauding) I'm not here to condemn anyone. As an impartial fake journalist, it's not my place to say that pointing at someone and calling him a wuss is in any way inappropriate for a serious political party. But I should warn conservatives that some of the shots they're one particular target they didn't mean to. - [Woman] Conservative We don't want these wimpy, woke guys that focus more on their hair. - [Trump] I'm just checking I'm talking... (audience cheering) - [Man] Men just look at another man and you can kind of kinda look at the way he (audience laughing) - [Man] Being a real man is about having personal responsibility. - [Interviewer] January 6th. Is there anything you regret about what you did on that day? Yes or no? - [Trump] I had nothing to do with that. - [Man] The hug is not You hug your wife from the body, you don't hug like this. (bright music) Here's twitchy Tim on stage, waving profusely in a Men should not move this way. It's not the way we move. (audience laughing) - [Jordan] Don't listen Don't listen to them. Nothing is more manly than Nothing. (upbeat music)
