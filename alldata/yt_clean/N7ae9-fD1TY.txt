[ Music ] [ Music ] &gt;&gt; The Silver Valley of North The valley follows the of the Coeur d'Alene River which that branch off into the Tall trees, icy springs, and This is a place of great beauty, but it also can be Since the late 1870s when the valley has attracted people rugged people, adventurers in hard work, and a to survive these mountains. Miners and loggers were The mountains hid untold wealth and the miners were Loggers provided timber in the deep mines that The rocks held gold and Within 50 years, the valley of the richest mining Tens of thousands of families with over 100 mines that flooded the None shone brighter than the Kellogg, Idaho. [ Music ] The Sunshine started as the and mined by two brothers from Their claim located up a just east of the town of from other nearby claims. It was rich in silver rather than the more common a heavy lead ore True and Dennis were to subsidize their farm. They raised fruits in the rich creek bed and made a good living to hungry miners It wasn't until 1914 that leased the mine out and in 1918, the Sunshine Mining The company struggled for for metals rose and fell. In 1932, a bold gamble paid off. Scarce dollars had been spent Just when the ore the fabulous Sunshine And by 1937, the Sunshine Mine in the world, mining of silver that year. The story of the Sunshine and miners of the Silver Valley Conditions in the mine could and temperatures deep in &gt;&gt; They said the of the walls was 112 degrees. And when we walk in there it was like walking because you would until you got your &gt;&gt; The Sunshine, like many in the Silver Valley, sat This made it possible for the in the rocks and made it The men attracted to this physically strong, and independent to a fault. They worked hard The mines paid good wages to Miners who worked in drifts, as "gypos" and were their expected day's pay. &gt;&gt; Back then it was super. It was really neat. Because you didn't you didn't have any rules whoever you worked with taught And the people underground a little on the wild side. They-- A lot of horseplay, but I mean, everybody and the money was real super. &gt;&gt; I think that people played they made good money, And you put up with the heat, and things like that you'd be around to spend which would buy you an extra &gt;&gt; The Sunshine Mine of the silver-producing By the time it closed over 360 million Its place in history, though, but from an infamous event that May 2nd, 1972 was a One hundred seventy-two men went expecting to do what The mine was huge spreading over two and over a mile north and south. The mine that had started on the surface was now with working levels every 200 of old worked out areas by most of the miners. These areas were sealed off by cinder block or timbered or stoppings. Huge fans on the or boreholes underground to the phases and Because the mine was so large, ventilation was a &gt;&gt; The Sunshine Mine through ventilation from the exhaust So Sunshine followed to use polyurethane rigid polyurethane foam and make them essentially and of course that was done. That product, by the way, and self-extinguishing and safe &gt;&gt; A system of track and underground shafts to their work areas which and nearly a mile vertically from the main surface The 3700 level was the from the Jewell shaft out that provided access to the The number 10 shaft had four The largest was the on the 3100 level that was from deep in the mine to where it could be transported This hoist had cages suspended that could hold nine men each, but it was not usually The men actually rode a a chippy. This hoist was a four-deck cage that could hold 48 The hoist man for the chippy The Sunshine used men called in a shaft and communicated of bells to make or ore were hoisted On May 2nd, the men out to the number 10 down to the many working Miners generally worked in remote areas called and lunch buckets with them. Gypos didn't want to that could keep them They didn't stop working and even ate their &gt;&gt; When you're gypo-ing and my partner and I, You're actually working your speed is double pace. Try to get as much within the eight hour period. &gt;&gt; The morning of May on the graveyard shift This was not unusual. Ventilation fans or train electrical fires. After a blast, when the air was and dust, it was hard &gt;&gt; Some of the guys said they we come out that of us smelled anything. But then we were and would shoot rounds &gt;&gt; On the day of the I had worked graveyard. The night before, we about 6 o'clock in the morning. As we came out of the number we went by the Strand As we came by that Glenn Shoop [phonetic], who and actually the lead man of our crew asked me And I said, yes, I did. And Ray Rudd [phonetic], that night had but he had lit it And we just kind of &gt;&gt; The day shift started and most men ate their In some areas, it was no one thought this was By 11:30, however, it was obvious there was Smoke was thick on which was the primary It was coming down the through the lower &gt;&gt; The day of the fire, and I came back up I repacked my supplies And as I got on the station, I've seen a cager And they went down. And that was about I would say 10 minutes across that station And from there on &gt;&gt; Shift bosses began rounding where the fire was or &gt;&gt; Dewellyn Kitchen A motorman came back and out because,&quot; they said, So I told him, I said, &quot;Well, we I said, &quot;this guy So I said, &quot;They're going to just send me back here again.&quot; You know, and I said, So we took off on the motor And it was a solid I mean, just white. So we sat there and decided if And I told them, I said, &quot;they're going to And I said, &quot;The to be all open for us.&quot; So I said-- because I told them, I said, &quot;Let's just &gt;&gt; The men gathered at the shaft and waited for the cages to In 1972, there were no that required miners to to protect themselves or be trained in The Sunshine was one of that even provided them, at the shaft stations on They were kept in cabinets not with the miners themselves. As the men gathered they were already having trouble Unfortunately, few knew that the the biggest danger. &gt;&gt; It became smoky, so we went out towards the station going on. And Virgil Bevs [phonetic] He come out to the And he was talking on I could hear what he said. Finally he says, &quot;Go out of their working place.&quot; We had a motor crew there So we started going to We went and told them, When you came out the smoke was coming It was getting real thick, So most people tended to where there could We were-- We stayed on the station hoping We were there quite a while. We'd send guys up station to Finally, a cager came down. He wasn't really a cager, He volunteered to cage that day. &gt;&gt; As we're going everybody was getting... and then stuff like this. &gt;&gt; Your problem is seeing so thick, sometimes you in front of your face. And you put your light down, down close to your feet so you from getting lost &gt;&gt; It was so smoky. You put your hand like-- out like that and you Your like, in your light. It was just thick. &gt;&gt; My partner and I, there was up on the walls that nobody So we-- my partner took in-- took the box down and got these and started handing them out. Some of them, they couldn't push because they were rusted out. &gt;&gt; And I told Ketch &quot;There was some self-rescuers I said, &quot;Grab one of them.&quot; And we tried to punch and you couldn't punch the with a wrench to So we got the self-rescuers you take it out because, you Nobody was thinking There wasn't a clue. &gt;&gt; Greg Dionne, a 23-year-old that day. He was trained as a cager and when the skip finally &gt;&gt; Greg came down and the smoke and he had these self-rescuers. They look like a tuna fish in the center that you pushed so you could breathe through it. Well, he handed them out &quot;Push that little and don't take them off.&quot; He says, &quot;They will get hot.&quot; So I grabbed mine and pushed Put my nose plugs I said, &quot;This thing He said, &quot;You got to break it.&quot; So he took out his pipe and broke everybody's seals so He said, &quot;Now, stick them So he stood by the shaft, And he started pushing guys down I wasn't so sure I was glad when I stepped out But he packed us in there There was no gates on it. This was the double-drum skip. He put more on there than He moved it nice and slow. We all got situated. He says, &quot;You ready?&quot; And we said, &quot;Yup.&quot; And we went up. Greg Dionne took the The way I understand it, because we told the crews on He went to the 5000 level, got sent them up, and Greg I went to school He was a good friend of mine Greg was a pipe fitter. His normal job, He knew we were in to help get people out. He knew where the He got the respirators and he And I honestly believe &gt;&gt; I told Ketch, I said, So we got over by the shaft, it And we had there And the cager, if I remember And he said, &quot;Get on.&quot; And it was smoky enough. I said, &quot;What are He said, &quot;Get on.&quot; And then I realized there So I got on the cage and There was nine-- there of us on a nine-man cage. And I reached back for Ketch &gt;&gt; And it wasn't him. &gt;&gt; No. I grabbed some kid that &gt;&gt; The day of the fire I was with the number 10 shaft. I was in there, I shrink stope by the motor crew that was to evacuate the mine, And I thought that could because I thought, &quot;Fire? What could burn here I mean we're in a There's-- The only that you really see is and I don't see anything And then we walked through up that air door, it you could barely see-- just maybe a foot &gt;&gt; There was no panic. No, everybody was calm. That's half-- the reason Nobody was worried. Everybody knew everything because a hard rock &gt;&gt; I didn't have a self-rescuer. They had some old They were beating on to get them to work. Don Beehner, the guy that I give had a flashlight, looking yah high with a mouthpiece And he took it out of his mouth to where I can breathe again. And then I felt like I because it was his anyway. And I gave it back to him and in water and tried to &gt;&gt; The 3700 level was from the number 10 shaft The man train was on this level with the route it took. The 3700 level, however, to be overcome with The miners who were to the 3700 level did &gt;&gt; The shaft crew had already to come down and get us out of down and they had gotten on the on the skip and I And my partner was I was 25 and he was And so he carried those or three inhalers with And he forgot to get his dinner and he wanted to take a because the smoke was really And he said-- He mentioned he says, &quot;I forgot my bucket.&quot; Well, I knew he had laid his so I stepped off the skip for him because-- and then the Well, when I stepped off I didn't know that at where Jesus Christ And I stepped off the and I got his dinner bucket, and three other fellows when I stepped off, and and there was no room for So the skip was belled and those individuals got off on &gt;&gt; The men waiting below for the in vain. The hoistman had been overcome to their desperate calls. The 48-man chippy hoist leaving only the single-deck &gt;&gt; So finally the skip come the crews that were there. Over there, we filled the on that skip and I said, for me to get on here.&quot; He says-- I said, &quot;Go ahead He says, &quot;No, you're not going to catch you're getting on here with me.&quot; &gt;&gt; Who was your partner? &gt;&gt; Gerald Anderson [phonetic]. And he says, &quot;No, So he reached down, the skip about like this and [inaudible] or the double-drum so I just stuck my feet And so he swirled his arms around in like this all No doors on the skip, just And here we was, and then on that skip with me and the that shaft so bad that it just-- to burn your eye So I took him, and &quot;Can I have a bite of that?&quot; He was talking about I said, &quot;Yeah.&quot; I gave it to him, he And we got by. When we hit 3400, the smoke &gt;&gt; Communication There was a single with 13 separate phones located on the different Shift bosses throughout the to reach the surface to get and how they could &gt;&gt; The phone system was back, In them days were anybody in the whole system and that was a lot because everybody started at the same time very We got smoke here, smoke when it first happened that for sure where it was. &gt;&gt; The shifters didn't because they still They took responsibility And they weren't-- until their last man was out. So they remained, tried to And they didn't make it. There was, I believe, there was &gt;&gt; Most of the men who who were hoisted Very few of the miners had It was a maze of hall where men could be &gt;&gt; None of these guys nobody knew where 31 we took the man train down and 10, they never been out 31 that have many ins and outs. And so I said as we're going along, at so that, you know, kind getting, you know, And told them when we got to 5 whatever, and I said, we're at 5 shaft, we're halfway &quot; but at the same time, and my eyes are burning and your feet feel like lead because you can't hardly and the smoke keeps until finally we're-- and then the fresh air hit us. &gt;&gt; I've worked on 3100 so I knew but many of those fellows In fact, I think that knew that level. So between the two of us, Nobody ran, but we walked out, to 4 shaft, and then the It was miserable. Nobody passed out we were all standing upright. We were helping those who but we all made it out. &gt;&gt; We went up to 3100 and out to the Jewell station And Clyde Napier he was the chippy And Homer Benson [phonetic] When you think about it, though, we did more staggering And I kept thinking we'll grab him and carry him. But all the poison And if he had to fell down we'd probably all been there. So-- And they were dying just maybe not that long. The guy that kept me alive on a timber truck and went &gt;&gt; And that was Don Beehner? &gt;&gt; Don Beehner. &gt;&gt; Don Beehner. &gt;&gt; The Sunshine Mine had uncles and in-laws, all Del Kitchen had several family &gt;&gt; Then I came back and then that they brought out. They brought seven off And then the foremans and the and I told them that they from doing and I was because I was concerned My dad was there and my both of them. And-- But when-- I knew that they wasn't When-- And, you know, there's to tell these people that all that they're all right, that-- And it was hard for even to my own family. &gt;&gt; The Sunshine had a mine helmet crew. Many of the miners on the crew at that time didn't take it a hard rock mine so why would you &gt;&gt; We took it, the course, and then it was something you know, how to be able of these machines at the time, but we never thought And that was the farthest thing from your mind is the hard Your biggest fear was rock or something of that &gt;&gt; Bob Launhardt, the safety had been on the mine that He'd come up around 11 was sitting down to eat his that there was a problem. &gt;&gt; I never got my first that I had opened I received the phone call Tom Hera [phonetic], stating they wanted to bring the helmets I didn't put my mine I put my mine boots on, my mine And then my mine rescue training I went over to the and obtained a mine safety and a Drager gas detector, so I could check for &gt;&gt; The Jewell shaft was for the Sunshine. As Bob and the others went down of fresh air coming but as they move toward they found thick black smoke &gt;&gt; When I got down to several people asked me, What are you going to do?&quot; I'm going to take this apparatus &quot;We're going to with And there were three other Don Beehner was one, Larry and Jim Tingler [phonetic]. So those three people, who had been trained At least one of them, had been in very and consequently had already of carbon monoxide poisoning. We never got to number 10 shaft. When we got back into there was a crosscut from or carrying just a real heavy, dark, black smoke. So I signaled the motorman &quot;Put on your reading into some heavy smoke.&quot; And I said-- I told Larry, &quot;Go to run over anybody And we got back perhaps, I moving slowly in really across another individual, it And he was obviously distressed Well, while we were preparing Don Beehner took his face and said, &quot;Here, breathe this. This is good air.&quot; And in a matter, it seemed, of time, you know, a 20 seconds when he And the only thing that I so toxic from breathing that he didn't really &gt;&gt; He was the only casualty, [inaudible] casualty And I think there's a from mine rescue men, and you're not going to And to put your mask, your at that point is Carry other oxygen equipment but don't give up your own. &gt;&gt; News was spreading that something was Wives and mothers, children to gather in the mine yard. They had no real news, for themselves the thick &gt;&gt; I remembered I was driving and we have a big exhaust of like a smoke stack on it. I looked up there and just then word started getting around Nobody knew how bad &gt;&gt; Miner's wives were no they understood the dangers but it was obvious that this &gt;&gt; It was in a beautiful day Somebody came down the that are working afternoon because they are going to try to rescue the men I was terrified and I but he informed me that he said, you would want somebody And I said, &quot;That's true.&quot; &gt;&gt; Families prepared to until they knew what Community organizations Union, the Red Cross and churches brought &gt;&gt; There were people camping out until they got the bodies out. It was-- I don't know it was probably 100 people And Sunshine was feeding them, giving them blankets, They used the warehouse there out sandwiches and lunches, and for the guys going fairly chaotic around here for at least the &gt;&gt; The other mines in The Bunker Hill, a huge had a lot of experience and had a well-trained &gt;&gt; That way of the Bunker Hill a very extensive mine rescue where we're just putting the around with them, they actually So with that in mind and our management know early if they needed any And we were mobilized We arrived midafternoon, I'm or something like that. &gt;&gt; The Sunshine's to report in, no one really knew but rumors were flying. &gt;&gt; We just thought it might be up like put something on a or something like that where in the mine or maybe a hoist it was nothing that it was nothing where You know, a hard rock mine, And I think that's Rock doesn't burn. &gt;&gt; Most of their bosses and and it made it real bad at out in and out system was And the boss had the record book who was down there or &gt;&gt; We went through a We needed people as I'd say they trained us You paid real close attention. And from that point on, I difference in my life that any one person And I think that-- I feel I did. I felt I did something &gt;&gt; Back then they the older type self-contained And they was clumsy and I wore them outside. And then training was-- then it just what they needed to do. A lot of people didn't know &gt;&gt; In 1972, mine rescue The Sunshine Mine used McCaas, and provided only severely limiting Despite these limitations, and the first helmet and found deadly smoke &gt;&gt; I've not seen that sort There were-- People have There were 30, 40 bodies to the hoist room on 3100. It was very difficult It was in some respect, we were lucky to come in and not see our friends. &gt;&gt; They knew that that hadn't made it out, there So they went back with and they brought those five So it was kind of &gt;&gt; As the rescuers worked their they feared the worst, to the number 10 had survived. Miners were found at in hoist rooms, and The lethal combination and other poisonous gases had to survive, but they As the days wore on, families and company employees The Silver Valley was united to support those who waited. &gt;&gt; When anything happens when any disaster strikes, I out of the woodworker but they're there immediately to to let you know they're whether they know you or not. &gt;&gt; What I recall the most everybody was grouped together, Everybody pulled together or the families that was sitting out if their loved one was &gt;&gt; I think we'd-- I mean, but I think we heard that as soon as it started. I remember I had kids in my and they were frantic. And what do you say? What do you say? You just go on and you give and we didn't have any I love them. When they cried, I cried And we all got through it. &gt;&gt; Our family's situation than the others. I mean, when my mother they knew men were dead. They already knew it. And I can't remember if they brought my dad out. My dad was the last one brought out at the mine before they and just strictly went And lot of those people, We knew he was dead And I think that was for the whole family, sees the their loved one would where we knew it was &gt;&gt; The rescue effort was heroic. The primary goals for to keep themselves secure the mine and The fire was still raging and conditions underground &gt;&gt; What we were doing were so that we can get back to The idea was to get-- move as you could to the fire to to determine if there were any accounting for all &gt;&gt; They did it real well here, making sure that when one that was in contaminated air, that they had another &gt;&gt; Rescuers were As the fire burned through to collapse, severing electrical and destroying the The polyurethane foam lining sending out thick The heat was unbearable. &gt;&gt; One of the things with polyurethane foam in the situation it actually gets the in what they call Fuel-rich meaning, there's than there's oxygen available So the combustion it will increase and decrease Well, in the combustion gases carbon monoxide range Oxygen was down to Temperature ranged as high We had-- As fresh air base and then we made an extension a cable and fall and-- have And we went back to the in the hoist room we found everybody We turned around and came back and then went back up. But when we got at 37, we thought it was an air blast. What had happened at that raise, right there where we had the lifeline, that It was burning up above and fell through, it burned-- It sealed off the drift when would-- they wouldn't they would even found ash of And we were just lucky that it you know. &gt;&gt; The rescuers worked from two different Through the Jewell and through the Silver on the east side The Consil, connected to the and was maintained as and ventilation exhaust. As the rescuers made their they found no one alive. &gt;&gt; It was like a nightmare of where we had fresh into the contaminated to go into the 10 shaft. On 10 shaft station and and then around on the of dead people, lots Now, you got to remember, And-- You know, I think over again I was wanting my friends are trapped in the for me to get trained and get My friends, it's extremely of your friends up which is tough, it was &gt;&gt; The number 10 shaft down to the deep levels of of the hoist was working. Before rescuers could get for survivors, they had to This was a huge job. &gt;&gt; The power was screwed up on in and take new electric And we was in a hurry that there might still on the lower levels, so we to move the body south, so we that were on 31 that &gt;&gt; [Background Music] As the to restore hoist then the days were passing. Unknown to them, two men were [ Music ] [ Pause ] Ron Flory and Tom Wilkinson in a raise several thousand feet They had been told out to the shaft station &gt;&gt; At that time, I really We just said I would and that'd be no &gt;&gt; We didn't believe that Think about it, what can We all stood around the and then everybody and waiting for the Then it-- the smoke get And our self-rescuers to breathe through, so we and breathed around them and then put them back in. Tom and I had run out to to open the air door and see that way instead of So we're trying to get that And I carried him back to of the guys were and we and took him back to where well, we thought there and there is still One guy took the motor out and apparently the rest of to get to where we was They got within, 150 yards to where we was &gt;&gt; And the next thing I knew and there were-- I'll be-- I'm all right. Are you all right? And then I came to and I'm-- Ron started walking back down and then pretty quickly come &quot;Tom,&quot; he said, &quot;they're So at that time, him and and Dick [phonetic] was on the And we grabbed Dick and we and put him on [inaudible]. We tried to revive him and We knew he was dead. &gt;&gt; Tom and Ron were not trained of their coworkers bodies to stay where they were It was a long eight days. &gt;&gt; We weren't at the borehole, from the borehole, but we could that part and then it was and down the 5000 level. And so we just more or We knew as long as as long as that wall that we would be safe because in behind us. &gt;&gt; And I think the first to the water line there, so we and we drank a lot of water. We tried to kept water it's pretty warm down, around 100 probably, at &gt;&gt; On the surface, of Mines were working They were training miners and they were convinced that some men had survived if they had only to the newly finished This borehole had been and was located about 1500 between 3700 and 4800 levels. Fresh air was forced If anyone survived, Bureau rescuers borrowed from the Atomic Energy to send Wayne Kanack [phonetic] and Dan Morris [phonetic] This was a dangerous The borehole was unlined for the torpedo to fit through. If any rock broke loose, Tom and Ron were beginning They still had no idea or how many people were dead, they just knew they had &gt;&gt; We're out in the smoke seven down there. And we didn't know until later that we thought we wet our over our mouth that help save us, we didn't that that did absolutely no &gt;&gt; We was always wondering what was going on, I think when-- one of them-- when you get, you [inaudible] the other guy was there &gt;&gt; No, we never actually We-- Like I said to come down to get us. And we were-- we just hoped that they would get there &gt;&gt; On May 9th, Ron discussing their situation when Ron thought he &gt;&gt; It was in the afternoon, the And I think Ron and I was-- we were both there [inaudible] boards. And we've been talking. And Ron was the one and he seen reflection And he told me, he said, coming down the tunnel.&quot; And I-- And that's where And I said, man, he's I said, &quot;Don't be nuts.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; he says, &quot;there's &gt;&gt; They had sent a And we didn't know until the day before they were and they didn't know &gt;&gt; The survivors were rescuers brought stretchers but When they came out the gathered crowd went wild. &gt;&gt; When we come out-- got they want to put us on a And Tom and I both, we're going to walk out.&quot; So they-- we got of us they let us walked out. &gt;&gt; And I remember when we and the open doors, and and people just started And I just couldn't imagine a who was cheering us on. I just-- It's hard to believe. Especially after -- they had already knew that they lost somebody &gt;&gt; When we come out of the and we just more or less put our And both of us walked past our wives, we didn't see them, they reached out and grabbed We got a little flack &gt;&gt; Tom and Ron were taken to the They were very hungry. Cecil Andrus, the and made sure they got cold &gt;&gt; And I remember Governor he sat down and asked Of course, we wanted a beer. So Governor Andrus said and gets us six [phonetic] &gt;&gt; Back at the mine, the news that two survivors to the rescue crews They were thrilled and the good &gt;&gt; Man, it was just-- it of your coworkers And it was something that you to happen after what and you'd knew how And that-- And for them it was a miracle, you know. &gt;&gt; For four more days, rescuers to the lower levels of the mine. When they reached they finally accepted the fact that no one else would &gt;&gt; When we come down what we really know now This is, you know, and This is what's in my heart. This is the last level and I'm you know, I'm wanted I'm wanted-- that I'm and I'm scared and It looked like the guys were all because when we went they were piled on like the gas just hit them and they just all You couldn't recognize people. We had to unpile them &gt;&gt; Recovery of the Areas of the mine were unstable after their timber Tie supporting the rail Electrical lines to power the hoists Many of the surviving in the recovery effort just to find work elsewhere. When the mine finally reopened, it was obvious that the &gt;&gt; Before the fire and that were-- they were miners. When they told you something, They knew what they And you lost the men After that, you could say that if you put a hard And you would have accidents one that it had cost Sunshine. It really had. &gt;&gt; I believe that my from that Sunshine fire. I lost a lot of friends. I lived for years after that the bodies of my friends and when we brought them out. And I would wake up at for a long time, and it to get that out of my mind. &gt;&gt; When the mine reopened, some of the Sunshine miners to go back underground. Others returned because it &gt;&gt; It gets in your blood. I mean it really does. It's in your blood. It's something that somebody-- my relations always tell me they they said, &quot;Why did I said, &quot;I just had to.&quot; I had to go back. It's as if something that's-- they tell you, you got to back, &gt;&gt; The Sunshine mine of the worst hard of the 20th century in America. Ninety-one people but many lessons were learned. Few people denied that hard than it was before the fire. The Metal, Nonmetal of 1977 was a direct It finally put some teeth for hard rock mines and mandated that every miner receive are ever sent underground. &gt;&gt; The Sunshine fire changed It changed regulations. It increased regulations and certainly increased For example, in my rescue we would train for eight hours a New employees might have a Now, if they're inexperience, they have to have 40 &gt;&gt; Back then our people, our mine rescue crews about once a year Now, we train four times a year. We also-- We train in smoke. &gt;&gt; After that, the on a whole meaning, you know, the guys started in the safety meetings The guys didn't know If the rescuer got hot, it was they would jerk it and two seconds later &gt;&gt; The cause of that fire, that I think it really For one thing, the the hoistmans all have in the hoist room with them. And they set out continuously And everybody carries a And we've had extensive A lot of those boys I in their mouth, but they that thing got hot, I it might have been told to either you don't pay attention or you have a tendency A lot of miners are &gt;&gt; You know, the concept And there was no refuge we have refuge chambers that are and air, and all have &gt;&gt; And now it's set up you were properly trained your first job when to learn all your escape on a job, you know the way out. It goes back to kindergarten, to kindergarten, the first They have fire drills. We do too. And I think that that Mines in general have really They try to make it where of shutting doors, turning off that would happen so All our escape routes set up so that no matter which way you're escaping out through the smoke like into fresh air all the time. &gt;&gt; One of the hardest lessons that the impossible Survivors of the fire worry that believing as they did, that If this happens, another &gt;&gt; I have long been to have another disaster. I believe that we're-- we've history repeats itself.
