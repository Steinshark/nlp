-Hey, what did you do? -At home, I have so many wigs. -Can't you see? What is this? Is this a wig? You are bald! What is this disgusting wig? Why did you do this? Shame on you! This is none of your business! You are bullying, my friend and I can't have that. Just get away from me with your bald friend. Don't be upset, Reem, never mind what she's saying. Take your wig and never care about what people say. Okay. You're the most beautiful girl. -Thank you. Shfa, I bought a new wig, it is very beautiful. God! I'm excited to see it. And I also bought beautiful hair clips. God! I'm going to teach you how to make beautiful hairstyles with them. You are beautiful no matter how you are. Thank you. -What did you do? Bald? Stop! Shame on you, give her her wig back! It's none of your business. We're going to call her bald Reem! Bald Reem! Bald Reem! Stop! Give me my wig bag! Oh Baldy is going to cry. Smile for the camera. Now the whole school will know that you are bold. You are pathetic. Don't be sad Reem, you are strong. I printed bald Reem's picture now I'm going to make the whole School laugh at her. Bald Reem's picture! -Now she's the laugh of the school. Here she is. Reem, your pictures are all over the place, you are known as the bald girl now. Ghazel, you have gone way too far. People have feelings and emotions, you should have some fear of God. This is not funny at all, shame on you. Just imagine yourself in my position. We have hair, yet you are bold. Don't be upset Reem. I have an advice for you, Reem, don't cry because crying will make your hair fall. Oh I forgot, you don't even have hair. -Ghazel, Sousou, let's go home! -Okay. Goodbye baldy! "One month later" Mom, what's wrong with Sousou, why did she lose all her hair? My daughter, it's because your sister is taking chemotherapy and it caused all her hair to fall. Mom, does that mean my sister is bald now? Never call her that again, be careful with her feelings. Okay. Mom, this is all because of me. Why are you saying that my daughter? Because there was a girl at school who was bald. And I used to bully her and make fun of her. It's wrong what you did my girl, and it's very shameful, you should repent for it. I ask God for forgiveness, may God forgive me. Just stay with your sister, I have to go because I'm busy. Okay. -Hello. -Reem, Shfa, why are you here? We heard that Sousou is sick so we came to visit her. Get well soon, may God heal your sister Sousou. Thank you girls. Me and Shfa brought Sousou a gift. -Thank you. -You're welcome. -Sousou. -Beautiful Sousou. Girls. Look, we got you this beautiful wig. God! Such a beautiful wig! Take it. It's going to look amazing on you. And we also brought you this week, it's blonde. God, it's beautiful. And this one as well. God! And we also got you hair clips, look. -Look at this one. -And this one. God! You look very beautiful. -Thank you girls. -You are welcome. We're going to decorate it with hair clips. My sister has been sad every day, this is the first day I see her laughing. You have made my sister happy, may God make you happy. Sweetheart. You look beautiful Sousou. That's right. I'm sorry girls that I used to bully you. I forgive you. My sweetheart Shfa. My sweetheart., Forgive me for what I have done. I will tell my story and how I became bald. I used to have a very beautiful hair and too long and gorgeous. Suddenly, my hair started falling heavily. I didn't know what to do! I was very scared. After that, I had a sickness and I lost all my hair and this is my story. Your story is very touching. I'm sorry I bullied you and treated you badly. We forgive you, we hope that you learned your lesson now. You girls, you're the best girls ever. What should I do? I'm hungry! I'm hungry as well! Do you understand? stop talking about food, I'm starting to get hungry. -I have an amazing idea! I'm going make you eat and drink for free. What do you mean free? I don't understand. Just stay with me, we are going to drive all the restaurants. May God protect us from you. -Do you have a restaurant's number? You will see what I will do to them. Hello, restaurant, get me two chicken burgers. Okay, bye. -Do you have any money? Did you order from the restaurant? Yes, we ordered, give it to me. Here you go. -Can you pay please? What's wrong with her? -Here you go, Shfa. Just tell him to go away. -Why didn't you pay? Our food is clean, it has no hair in it! Our restaurant is clean! Don't force me to call the police on you. Forgive me, my sister, just don't call the police. Do whatever you want, we will never repeat this again. I don't need anything from you, just get away from me! Okay, bye. Our plan worked! We managed to eat without paying a penny. You are dangerous, Ghazel. It's delicious! We fooled them. Thank God, we are full. -Ghazel, you turned out to be a genius. It was hot, I need something to cool off my stomach. Get us some cold drinks. All right, I will order the best drinks for you. Hello, restaurant, get us two cold drinks. Now they will bring us the best juice that will cool us off. Bravo, Ghazel! -You again! Here you go. What about the payment? Payment? Shut up and get away from here. People who don't fear God. Just let him get away from here. Shame on you, my sister, God is stronger than injustice. Are you calling me a liar? Don't let me sue you and close your shop. You're saying that the order contains bugs; I swear it doesn't contain any bugs. I prepared the order myself, and the order is very clean. I am certain of that. Stop talking to me! Shut up! God is sufficient for me, and He is the best disposer of affairs against you. You are lying to me. I didn't do anything and I'm innocent. I'm telling you to shut up! Goodbye! Ghazel, didn't you hear him supplicated against you? You shut up as well, just let me drink my juice in peace. Do you know, Ghazel, halal food tastes different. Everything we did is Haram and injusti against people. Mashallah, you ate and drank and now you're talking about me. -May God forgive you.
