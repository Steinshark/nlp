In this video, we're going of performing And although, that may seem you'll be surprised it is to perform calculations That's one of the things that is that there are There's a zero and a one. We sometimes refer since there are only make up this numbering system. If we combine a group together into a group of eight Sometimes, you'll as an octet just to make sure are eight bits in that byte. It's very easy to when you have a So let's build one right now. Grab a pencil one We're going to write And we'll use this to perform the but you'll use this like subnetting on To build this chart, on a piece of paper-- 1, And above that, we're going These are very easy On the far right, we're just and then we're going 1 times 2 is 2. 2 times 2 is 4. 4 times 2 is 8. And we'll just keep above each one of these 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128. That is our binary With just this chart, all the calculations that If you wanted to from a different perspective, we perspective 2 the 0 power is 1. 2 to first power is 2. 2 to the second power And then when you a lot of IPv4 calculations you'll find that it may be rather than to think in the But in either case, you that we can use to perform Now that we have our perform our first calculation. And the question we have is what And to perform this going to write down that number. We don't know exactly what quite yet. But now we're going to got from our conversion chart. We'll just put them This is where we We're going to look at Every time there is a 1, we're to the bottom. And every time going to just bring a So the only place there and we've got a 128. So we'll bring down and all the rest are 0's. We're now going to So 128 plus 0 plus 0 plus 0 and we get 130. That is how easy it is to when you have that binary And as long as you chart you've created, you and do the calculation of Let's do another one. On this one, I'm going to 11111111 in decimal. And it's the same process We'll take those 1's and we'll We'll add our conversion and we'll bring down has a 1 associated with it. And in this particular has a 1 associated with it. There's no 0 in any So our question is really plus 32 plus 16 plus 8 And if you add all you get 255 in decimal. Now you can take put it into your and you should be able on the other side Now let's reverse this process. Let's now take a decimal the binary number is of that. This process isn't quite but we're going And you'll see it's to perform the calculations. Again, we're going to bring but we don't know So we're currently going And we're going to add our just as we have before. And now we want to And what's interesting is that there's of all of these numbers So we start asking For instance, is 128 less I would say that yes 128 is So we're going to bring down into that decimal mark. Now let's move to the right. We'll perform the same less than or equal to 154? In this case, those They are not less So we'll put a 0 and Now let's add the next So our question will be or equal to 154? Those combined together are 160. So those are not less We'll bring a 0 down there. So we keep performing We'll calculate, for That is less than So it gets a 1 and we and we'll keep going. Now we're up to 144. So we keep calculating. Is 144 plus 8 less It is. It's 152. So we add a 1 and Now we've got a 152. And you could almost now in your head. 152 plus 4 is 156 that is not 152 plus 2 is So that's a yes, and we know We're finally up to 154. So we can bring a 0 So now we have this which is 10011010. We've now taken 154 converted it to binary just and getting our binary We've been working with but of course you can of calculations. And when you start getting you'll find that you have that you have to work with. For example, if you there's only a number four ways that you can 00 is 0, 01 is 1, There's only four things come up with when you're And as you start working when you have three all the way through can see the maximum that you might be able to will be based on the size And in a later video, we'll And you'll become more these different sizes When you get into more you'll find you very easily in a single address. And I've added this because once we get we start extending up. It's the same process. We just keep doubling So 2 to the seventh power We double 256 to get the 512. We double 512 to get to 1024. Double 1024 to get So you should be able as far as you need doing the subnetting just by chart and doubling get to the value you need.
