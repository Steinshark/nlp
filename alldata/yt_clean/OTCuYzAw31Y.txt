BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Wow. Everybody's all quiet How are you guys doing today? AUDIENCE: Great. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: seats up here in front. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --if anybody BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Wants it. Good. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Welcome to Manipulation. I am Bryan Fitzpatrick. Most people call me Fitz. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And I Everybody calls me Ben BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So we are engineering managers at Google. I see a lot of familiar faces BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --which And we started the Chicago years ago in 2005. And we've been working as managers for a lot BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah. And in the course of our gone from software engineers We've worked on a bunch We worked in open source And so over that period of time bunch of stories and experiences share with you. And we've been doing that And this year we want to talk corporation. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: As usual, also with a disclaimer. We have a very brief one here. And basically, the same thing which is that these And some of it doesn't actually working for morons or But our point here is that And if you don't like it, you And lastly, we think that what not the only way to But we think it's the most time when you're working It's true. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Doing and a lot of work. But really, if you want to be you need to learn to work with So, that takes us to our next corporations, companies, as you not made out of source code. And they're not made out of-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Compilers. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: They're not made out of They're actually made BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Companies are And people are what not only in companies are what prevents of cases, as well. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Or cause BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Or, yeah. Occasionally, they do cause But more than anything, if in a big company and make things learn how to navigate them. OK. Now if you're in a small in fact, maybe we should do a work in a company of less OK. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. 16 to 100? 100 to 1,000? BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Bigger BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Woh. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Oh, OK. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: All right. You're going to like this. So, you're the guys who need the big truck of bread crumbs to BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: All right. So that's a lot about what Now, I'm aware-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: manipulation's a little weird. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's a BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's sensational titles, like that sort of thing. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We could office politics. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right. But we like to call it BRYAN FITZPATRICK: You could engineering, if you like. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Ah. [INAUDIBLE] BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So, there's We're going to give surprises at the beginning. There's three parts. We're gonna talk about working reality, BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Just to BRYAN FITZPATRICK: The company that most people point or another and ourselves in in the past. And lastly is the manipulation, awesome part. But most companies are and sort of the reality. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So you get applies to your situation-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So let's start with the Like, what should it be like corporation, right? Let's talk about-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: We'll make very interesting. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: No, I like this. So the first thing that you need what we preach in a lot of our a bad word. That really we talk about Because the worst thing that and that's-- stop managing, start leading. And what it means to lead is servant to your team. If you have a good leader-- could be a manager, could be their job is not to tell Their job is to remove butler to your team, make efficient and happy. And I'm sure that's exactly the But that's the ideal And that's what we try to practice as managers ourselves. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And That's how we learn. So we get better at these BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: But I mean, first time I had a meeting with Schmidt, he came to Chicago. Had this long meeting I was very nervous. And he was asking me all At the end of the meeting he do you need? I mean, I had done all this answers to all these questions I had no answer for this. I just sort of, I'm like, what I'm just some dude. You're the CEO, man. Aren't I supposed to do And-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: That's BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's And it's one that I like to teams as well. What do you need to What do you need to be happier, And I can guarantee you the next had an answer. I had a whole laundry list of I was ready for that BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But that's Eric saw himself as there to what have you done for him BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: That's leadership. So the other thing we'd like working in this ideal company, should pursue responsibility. And what we mean by that is comfort zone and do things that and things that you think are for your company, not We like to talk about seeing the Sort of novice engineers They expect to get They do exactly what Then they come back and they And in a great company where software engineers who are have a situation where they're is asked of them. They go out. They not only do what was asked back with a more general something better done, right? BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: There's BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And that And that should be encouraged. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right. An example is if you're a forest out in the forest to cut The novice forest ranger is diseased tree, and come back But the more experienced one down the tree, removed all the everything. And I found 57 other trees that And they're right here Would you like me to do BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Exactly. It's creating a plan. And those are the kind of people more work, which is usually a you're doing. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's BRYAN FITZPATRICK: The reward BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Sure. As long as you like the work. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's No, really. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: As long as the reward. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: As long But I mean, your leader's more interesting things to less work for them. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:They see BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Exactly. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, what corporation? BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Well, you You might, instead of just doing might actually question right or you think it's harmful something better you can do. It's more of a dialogue than do this, and you just It's about not being It's about challenging the of better ways of making BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Part of that also is just This is something I know naturally to everybody. There's that old joke about how is outgoing? BRYAN FITZPATRICK: How, Ben? BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Looks All right. Fine. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, but team when you're doing software you want to let your manager You want to know about your victories, about your failures. You want to know what your What do you need, right? BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Having the ready to go when somebody asks there with the blinders on BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And Like-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Sure. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Remember when with legal, and they were like response from legal. And Ben and I were having a cup oh my God, you know, this This legal is not responding. And I said, why didn't I know these people in legal. And I got on the phone and and a half. And that's not because I'm It's just because I knew who to let's shall we say. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: communicated with you. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Awesome. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yay So another thing that people companies is actually is that you ask to be treated, BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right. If you expect somebody to often act that way. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right. So, it's about getting Nobody should be counting how desk when you check If you get your work If you don't get your work BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So that's certainly is true at Google. One of the reasons we like everybody like an adult And it's a wonderful thing. And that is not true of other BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. Well, there was a guy that came was on my team a number And he'd worked in industry And it was his first day. You're a little bit, Quarter to 5:00, he came look, I'm really sorry. I have an appointment that I've got to go. But I'll be here 15 minutes And I said, look, man, I don't As long as you put in your 80 BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And he looked that I was joking. But he did get the point that things happen, and that it's not certain time. It's about being available to the work gets done. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Sure. You were telling me another time in Chicago every winter where university, a whole And one of the first times you get the keys from the person And instead of a series of don't go here, blah, blah, blah, blah, the guy was just like, Here are the keys. I'll get them from See you. And like, you were telling BRYAN FITZPATRICK: That It was really. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It was like, wow, this person just I better leave this place better They expect me to behave this to their expectations. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right. I mean, if they set up say, here's the fence. It's six feet tall. It's made out of concrete. Don't go any further People will often just pile because they're like, I'm being I'm going to act like one. I'm a caged animal. I'm going to run around People look for those But when there are no boundaries this responsibility, I think BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So let's talk taking risks. If you're in a company, in an allowed to take risks and to can do things like fail fast. You can take more You can fail, document what then try again. If somebody gets upset with it's a way of learning Think about, Think about-- anybody You can raise your hand. You ever see a kid burn It's painful for the kid, They learn really fast BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And they You can sit there and give thermodynamics and But, man, they just stick their the last time they're ever BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah. Also when you exercise, things they talk about. If you work out at a gym, weights to the point where your fail because that's the point If you always just do just comfortable and then you really get any better. You just stay at that If you exercise to failure, you You grow, you adapt. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So without that risk, you BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So, those are can do if you're living in a raked like this. Unfortunately, we're aware that more like this kind And most people work look more like this. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So let's talk bad manager which is-- there's a statistic-- and remember that 75% of all there's a statistic that 50% of comes from your manager, whether with them or working for them. And that really is true I've had the, I'd say, really great managers in my in other places. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, a who essentially prevents we just talked about. They prevent you from taking Failure is a terrible thing. Not even the smallest failure is And of course, that spills And then you're afraid to In addition, the manager also serve him or her. And again, instead of what can you done for me lately. So, all the meetings you you're on the defensive. You're always trying to prove or to the company. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right. How are you gonna help me climb the manager here. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And whatever take credit for it. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Nasty. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Unless case that's all you. And that's unfortunately And this is something that most but everyone's aware of on the will ignore people like this, And that is one of the bad manager can do. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well, it's BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Well, it BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It causes performers. But, I mean, you've got six good person like this. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And pretty on the team start to leave-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Because they this person along. So a good manager's someone care of low performers. So this is some of the things BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Others Another important person to be politician. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: This is They're usually very great And this isn't necessarily This might be another engineer They're very quick to something that happens. They're also very quick But they put a lot of energy not being impactful. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Perception BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Exactly. Perception is 9/10 of the law. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And And they do everything to make as possible. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And the thing do when they encounter someone heads down and ignore them to write great code. I'm going to have BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Engineers BRYAN FITZPATRICK: 'Cause I don't want to deal But that's very dangerous this person can wind up getting your manager. We've seen that happen, too. So they're someone But it's another example of dealing with the promotion it's important to pay attention thing because it's yourself in a safe place. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You over by this person. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: If can happen very easily. Let's talk about the just the people you run into. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: There organizations out there. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: This BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And what know about? What makes a corporation BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Hey, Ben. I'd like you to finish that BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Awesome. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And I want I want you to QA it, push And, oh, I have a new feature BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Didn't you from my team? BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah, yeah. But you should be skydiving in BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --as well. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, right. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And don't bike and the rappeling. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, yeah, impossible expectations, not what they're asking you to do. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And when mean like-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: People. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --computing People are not resources. They're people. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: when people call them-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: I don't like BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: How have on your team? That's a pet peeve. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: But we've all can spend $3,000 on hardware and hours, but companies don't do there and you're going on. That's a capital expenditure. You're just a payroll BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah. They don't do the math with BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. So that's definitely something BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, corporations tend to do is they We talked about trust They treat you like They treat you like They just see you as And in the worst case, as a cog in a machine. This person is here to in y amount of time. And turn the key, it should And we're not doing an assembly This is a creative job that environment and a lot of social It's not just line up and turn the knob. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And there's technological ways that You get time cards where you Or you're caged by your IT gonna set up a big firewall and any website that might or waste your time. And we see companies do Or we're gonna prevent people mail or from using instant that sort of thing. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Just BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Exactly, And we're gonna measure your like lines of code. See how many many lines of That is a great way to encourage of lines of code, of BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: More I don't know what you're BRYAN FITZPATRICK: I'd like to they delete myself. But-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah, hard metric. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And so beyond get a little fuzzier. Some companies suffer from direction where there's without a central vision. You might have seven different directions. What was it, the quote Bob. I have seven bosses or eight But another characteristic of that's obsessed with titles and power struggles. And I have you on my team and want to work on that team, but because if you leave, I BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's just is huge too, right. Even if you put forth Herculean these impossible goals, if the goalposts around all the it's just infuriating. It just drives you insane. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And to some companies that are well functioning. Years ago when I first became a my happy little [? world, ?] and moving things Everything seemed pretty I knew where we're going. And then I became a manager, and other higher ups. And suddenly there's all We should do this. Maybe we should do that. And I went and talked to the manager and I said, crazy all of a sudden. What happened? I'm like, we were all going like all like this. And he's like, it's been He's like, I've just been hiding because it's-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Really BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --it's And I'm like, wow, you weren't BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: No. Yeah. But that's the sign of a great the reports from that chaos so BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's great cleaning person. You only notice it when Like, this place is a dump. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well, actually get things done in a even just a large The amount of dysfunction varies BRYAN FITZPATRICK: This is how particularly toxic BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Here BRYAN FITZPATRICK: The BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, the about-- and this is something hear a lot at Google. It's attributed to various I forgot-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: No, Grace Hopper, I believe. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yes, yes. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And if Hopper's talk on nanoseconds, It's on the internet. We're big fans of BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, the risk taking, but a particular It's know how far you can go your career, the risk But you will discover If you know something needs to right thing is to do, and you asking your seven bosses, Can I do this? Every time you ask someone is And that's the default answer, organization where people are So-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And the permission is because you're responsibility. I could be, look, I They said it was OK, So, the Bobs are preventing me BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's scary when you're doing a risk. But often that's the only way So act first, apologize later. That's the other way I've And don't do anything That's sort of the rule And be prepared to back up your come to you and say, why on And if it fails, try But at least you're getting the folks who are scared or permission, being turned BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And you can the consequences, BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yes. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: OK, so-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You control the consequence of the action. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right. So I can launch a product, but I come out necessarily. Or I cannot launch a product, gonna happen. You'll see this a lot in I'm gonna say something to my I'm gonna show them that this BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But then BRYAN FITZPATRICK: You can't gonna act or the way that So-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: other side is I want-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: You can a particular consequence. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: The result to be happy-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: That would BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --I have action that I know is BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And that's definitely the case in companies. And it's not a rational thing. Some people would say, well, you should act this way. If you ever hear yourself so-and-so should do something, just stop right there. Should is a magic word that means that you are trying And it's really difficult unless Brin, or both. I don't know. So, not saying anything. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: I've never BRYAN FITZPATRICK: I've never BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So let's This is something that There's usually folks in your who are very opinionated. Nothing wrong with that. Problem is they don't always And that is a hard lesson They put so much energy into everything that they end up because they're not choosing And it tends to drag down the It tends to drag down momentum having to defend and deal with So, you need to know not only You need to understand what you're spending to win BRYAN FITZPATRICK: BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Are you gonna spend all your gonna spend it over here? Because once you've used it favors, you've done whatever-- you can't just turn around and the next day on a different BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Because if you're trying to stop every 15 minutes in the train, run you right over. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And BRYAN FITZPATRICK: They But also remember that every you're slowing down the progress So that's something that you think about, is it worth it? If you're gonna beg forgiveness permission, make sure it's You don't want to spend all making t-shirts or something. You'd be better to spend it BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Now great idea but you're not sure in the organization or laterally And you'll fight a battle, and And it turns out sometimes the there is not to make a giant do the subtle, subliminal way of So it turns out that your ideas far in a company-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Really far. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --if you or if you just don't care credit for the idea. So it can be something as level, just sort of whispering or to certain people at the lunch table. Or mention it in passing when And maybe he'll overhear. It's an art form in actually pretty powerful. We've seen this happen, and by the time maybe somebody maker hears the idea formally much buzz about it already in seem like such a crazy idea. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And you can trying to change someone's mind tell people that you know who ask them to mention the And if they hear it from what's going on, if they keep again, they're gonna And next thing you know, you vice president's mouth at a And your response can be, Or you can be like, hey, That's pretty awesome. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right. Yeah. What's more important? That it happens or that Sometimes you have to choose. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: You're You have to choose sometimes. So, let's talk about habits. Anyone here has ever attempted smoking, quit drinking? Some people I know-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Caffeine. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --have BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Have BRYAN FITZPATRICK: But bad can't be destroyed. But we found that they can be OK. You have a great example of this teams you work with. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah. We had-- one of the teams I took over, at standing meeting. I know it was Agile Scrum But-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Oh, OK. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah. I'm not trained in those But it was every morning. We're gonna all stand here for around in a circle, And people were kind of were just doing it BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Well, but it BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: There was group therapy. Well, you know, I went out-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: You know, I say but I want to talk about BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Ow. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's cool. It's cool. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But the point is it wasn't a There were some nuggets of communication going on in there. So it would not have been, be like, this is stupid. Kill this meeting forever. Go away. Instead, we just replaced it. We said, all right, let's thread that goes out You have a cron job that just what's going on? What did you do yesterday? What are you blocked on today? Everybody reply to this Everybody spends 30 You're done. People can read the thread So much more efficient. Gets the exact same sort And it sparks off side that matters. That's we wanted. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: But there's well in that, is that-- and this introducing anything new is three magic words, BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Let's Let's try this for two weeks. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: If it doesn't it, we'll go back. And oftentimes, people are like, not permanent. We can actually just try OK. And then after three weeks, it wasn't so bad. This isn't so-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Or they just do it forever. That's usually what happens BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And beyond to the organization This is something that most often been abhorrent to is the ladder of a company. OK. We talked earlier about the sort of working it, trying And most of these bad organizations, have-- there's a mismatch between doing company and doing the right OK. So you have to make a choice. And it doesn't have to It can be a little bit You can do a little But it's dangerous if you choose thing and ignore OK. So, as we mentioned earlier, you until you get to a safe place. And so, it is worthwhile to BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: This companies that are very power and title is right at the That if you can get yourself people will leave you alone right, or some imaginary to leave you alone. Just working the BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. It's your bubble. It's your safe haven. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Now a only can you work up the ladder nobody can tell you what to do, in the company to hide. It sounds crazy, but that don't get bothered. There are teams that have so will question or bug you, or freedom that you might BRYAN FITZPATRICK: There's often what you're doing, as well, more that might be in a different So moving to a different or something is often a good nuclear war comes. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Sometimes couple years as the company want to stay happy. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Some of us every fifth Thursday I worked at a company years ago nobody answered the And if your boss showed up in was just panic time. But-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Talk BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Upward perception. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: This We said earlier that perception And so what that really means getting stuff done and doing the thinking in the back of your people not on my team or What are they perceiving, right, least as important as what The office politician And you need to at least-- maybe you don't need to office politician does, but at it and make sure it is not actually doing. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, you as possible because that creates You want to under-promise. You want to over-deliver. These are all things And I personally, I had problems first became a manager, My team had the project amount of technical debt, and So the first thing I said was, leader here. We really need to hunker down months just focusing on our be free of these shackles BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Great idea. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: like, that's great. We love it. You should totally do that. Of course, he was completely He didn't actually-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well, he great idea-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: He thought BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: The problem isn't-- this is about later-- is that I have we call offensive versus Offensive work is work that is like, write a new shiny feature, faster, anything that's going outside your team. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Defensive work is just as It's all the invisible Oh, we're gonna maintain We're gonna migrate BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Refactor-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We're BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --code. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --so We're gonna make our monitoring robust so we have That's all stuff that's management looks down. It looks like you're And that was a huge slap in my my director was like, you guys doing anything. I'm like, oh, look, We're doing so much work. And like, it looks like you're And he was annoyed. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Looks like broke in the first place. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right. Why didn't you write it BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: There's There's no-- so that's the sad though defensive work is just work, you cannot spend all your BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And to be attitude that people have. It's just the-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --perception is 9/10 of the law. And that's absolutely BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So we about usually-- never spend more than about a as a team on defensive work. Because if you do more than you're holding still. And-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: If you do falls over. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right. But it's a tricky But you have to stay BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So, next I want to make you an offer Think of the movie There's a favor economy, that there's not cash. It's like someone asks you to easily do-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Or you BRYAN FITZPATRICK: You can typically gonna be easier for happen, than for them. And, it's very much in your time, to do that for someone. Now, I'm not-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Not BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Not in the take a little bit And I'm not saying that you anyone walk over you or someone advantage of you. But look for opportunities And these are the kind of bets, where there's no You make a small bet you're just gonna lose. A buck, it's gone. Buck, it's gone. But every once in awhile, you're and it's gonna come back and BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So when trust, making these small karma and trust that will There was a great quote somebody about this idea with them. The quote was, friends come and It's a great thing because burn bridges. That's the corollary to this your karma and trust in this burn a bridge. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: get very quick return. I mean like the recruiting team said, hey, you guys are the lab coats, right? We want to do some videos engineers-- ask questions of Google Would you guys mind taking Now-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Could It is a half hour, 45 minutes And we said, oh, sure. Yeah, we'll do that. So we did this video for them. And they were super glad to resources to help us find some Because now they know us. Anyone in recruiting's Your [INAUDIBLE] been such a huge help. And it's actually been a bigger recruiters worldwide are using recruit more people. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We get to at IO for the live stream because of small favors. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --some But it extends to absolutely There's a book called Anyone heard of it? The guy did a test. He put an ad out, and he said, Please come take a BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --to Sorry. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. Do you consider yourself Please take this-- I guess it's people who I don't know. So you had all these people And he said, are you And they'd say I'm And then he'd say, here's the I'd like you to read this. I'm gonna time you. And we're gonna see how fast you in the front section Ready? Go. And now the average person who took about two minutes find all the pictures. The average lucky person took all the pictures. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: How BRYAN FITZPATRICK: In the middle of the third said, there are 42 pictures OK. Unlucky people were very focused hand and nothing else. The lucky people were the people little bit outside. And so the point of this book manufacture luck for yourself. And the favor economy way of making luck. And so we're big fans of that. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Love it. So, it also helps, sort of favor economies, finding And what we mean by that is people within a company useful allies to have. We'll talk about them. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: I mean, and years later, right? BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah. It turns out I ended up managing college, became my report. It was very strange. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's a good BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But again, that's all about never know. The person who you have a fight manager in the next company. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Especially BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: The tech world is super, you think of it. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Our friend about 3,000 people in Everyone else is local color. So let's think about that next want to go out in a blaze of exactly what you think BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Go down the chute, right. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. Take your beer and hit So the first kind of person These are people who, basically, part-time jobs is connecting If you need to get a hold of don't know where to go, they're gonna say, hey, you have They'll be like, yep, BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah, exactly. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: They are BRYAN FITZPATRICK: They're BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Beyond the have influence within We happen to be lucky to have wonderful things like BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Also, celebrities either. So they could just be someone 20 years, a real old timer, may of power, but, boy, they know They know who everybody is. And they are sort of secretly behind the scenes. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: With BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: RIght. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Good ways you don't want to take credit BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Now, I'd like give you all a word Do not screw with administrative OK? You might think it's just some typewriter and typing BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: They they will cut you. OK. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: If you cross ruin your life. OK. Administrative assistants-- and I'm not saying that-- again, manipulating-- we're talking about We're not talking about being We're just talking about a little bit of politeness. It goes a long way. It really does. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: There's that flows-- I mean, there's like the Then there's the real And administrative assistants powerful than you think. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Well, a good will wield their executive's BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Sometimes for But, yeah. So you don't want to be on BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Great. So, the other thing, just communicating with people, a electronic communication. You're gonna do email. You're gonna do chat rooms. You're gonna do instant BRYAN FITZPATRICK: BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: [? air. ?] Face time is a huge deal. The mere act of getting on a branch of your company, or just other office is-- being in somebody's face has a the ability to get things done, you make with that person. 10 minutes in the face of an gonna have a much more memorable person than 20 emails you It's not the same. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: I learned I've known this for years, but I few months ago. I had a meeting with a senior It's a 15 minute meeting. I wasn't gonna fly View for that or anything. And we had a global outage of And so then I backed off to So, I'm in my cell phone, our building trying to get a ear and my phone up And they can't hear. They heard every third word. So, that's a very But being there, being there not only more helpful in the coming into the room and going little more time. Hey, how was your weekend? What did you do? What's going on? You wind up with chance You might walk to the next a few extra minutes. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's another about how it's so important to have lunch together. We give tours of our And we show them the free lunch for Google. And a lot of people will say, afford this? And the answer is, how can BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Return It's so great. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's huge even if they're not talking people together for lunch. Get them to understand that human beings that have lives, and children, perhaps. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Sometimes when you're trying to with people, they they're too busy, right. It's amazing when you just at their desk or-- this is crazy. Sometimes we pick up the phone, And they jump because they're ringing on my desk. I forgot it was there. What is that for? BRYAN FITZPATRICK: How many I don't even have a phone It rings through Gmail, But even when that rings, I prefer the asynchronous BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, Sometimes you need to Something's important enough in front of them and ask And there is an anti-pattern and want to promote. The anti-pattern is to-- maybe you're not right in Maybe you just want And the anti-pattern is you go rant, this tirade about wrong, blah, blah, blah. This is wrong. Then I did this and this-- And it's 15 paragraphs long-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: and all sorts of-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Because BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: All sorts embedded in there, right. And what does an executive an email like that? BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Delete. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right. Now why do they do that? BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Because they understand it. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: A busy seconds to go through email. If any of you have ever seen an a distributed denial Because the emails just come, BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And so, you time before they timeout. So if they get 10 seconds into you're on bullet point one of the point, they're just I wish I could help this guy, And people, like Ben said, will BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, we have works pretty well, has We call it the three bullets So essentially, you make three sentence each if possible. We love this example. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: This This is a fun example. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And then BRYAN FITZPATRICK: This is a great example. But I would like to disclaim, work for insane things. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It doesn't It doesn't work for getting windshield wiper idea. And it's not gonna with the CEO of Amazon. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: No. But it did work one working for Apple, before-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --you BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So, I've been a version of this I was at Apple about-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And I'd bought my mom one of It turned out it was And it just kept failing. And it spent more time in And I was super mad and And somebody was like, sjobs@apple.com. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Oh, great. Oh my God. And I just like started My mom got this computer and she did this and she did And then, you know, like, And this very wise guy I worked just wasting your time. He's like, make it short-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Really short So, I made it really short, as still too long. And then I said, look, basically resolve this so my mom crappy, broken computer. Because I feel bad. I work at Apple. I'm trying to defend it. And she's telling all got this busted computer. And about 15 hours later I got worked for Steve BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Administrative assistant, perhaps. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: No. It wasn't. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: No, OK. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Someone in which is an assistant And a week later, my And we've refined this, this over the years. And the shorter you go-- and points, I mean, three 80 You can't just keep line wrap stuff, right. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Now, make links to other-- like, if you want more detail, they're gonna need background, there or draw a line and say, below if you care. But as long as the top seconds, you're set. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right. So. Yeah, sometimes I'll do that. I'll put at the top brief long-winded rant-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --after your But the fact of the matter is they can wave a magic wand and them right some wrong-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: [INAUDIBLE] BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: They BRYAN FITZPATRICK: That is the They feel like Superman They're like, let's This is 10 seconds of my time. I forward an email. But if they can't parse it, delete it and get rid of it. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So give BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Super BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So what company and you try all these things still are horrible. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Well, you BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Plan BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So, we're takes a little bit of time, minutes here. This is Plan B. Plan B is get Now-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: A consider this option. That's just funny to me. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Now, we say cheek, and we're trying to But we've been giving these 2006, technically, I guess. And after these talks, every and says, you know, all that But I tried this and I've done I just can't make anything And last year at IO, this guy these things. This was two years ago. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yep. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: He He said what I can do. And I said get the hell I said, update your resume, into maybe some classes or BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: But If you can't change or navigate putting your energy Learn your new skills, I got an email from this guy And he said, hey, you're the hell out of my job And I went and took classes. And I am now-- just got a job offer in Japan as my dream company. So thanks for swearing at me. All right. But this is an-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --option. The minute you realize that you liberating. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Well, you Meng has a story about BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You BRYAN FITZPATRICK: OK. So Meng, Chade-Meng Tan, just wrote a book. It's called Search But he has a blog. And he talks about a lot of And he wrote a post earlier this I go into work and I do the the right thing. And then I sit back and And if I don't get-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --fired, then the right company for He said if I do get fired, then done me a favor. It's done us both a favor do the wrong thing for them, and their own thing for me. Now, I know this is a little And I am very much aware that BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: philosophy to think about. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It is He went on to describe that philosophy. And every day he would drive government subsidized And he'd think to himself, if I that's where I'm going wind up himself of what he had and BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Let's BRYAN FITZPATRICK: One BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Just a few. So remember that companies are thing you remember And being successful as a just being successful with your latest technologies. It also means learning how to deal with corporate politics. It's just as important. And it's something, learned through experience, BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's effectiveness. It's not just about touchy It's about a way to make your lot less effort. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Now, so. But before we wrap up, we've six years now. You may have seen or heard They're all available And I think they're going to BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. We love the effect. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You may BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yes. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: bunch of these talks. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And now And so, we're really happy we've never announced this occasionally on our But, we've written a book that bunch of other stuff. It's called Team Geek. And it's available. You could pre-order it. We won't give you any particular it from, like Amazon. But you could buy it from And you'll find information other stuff in here. But it's all about people engineering. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It'll be And so we have little cards, BRYAN FITZPATRICK: They're BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Are BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Thank you Now, if you want to leave, We do have some time for Q&amp;A. We BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Please BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So, BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --if BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Anything BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yep. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Otherwise, Any questions? Let's see if anybody hits scared everyone away. Here comes someone. First question. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Hello. MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon. A little quick background. I work a Fortune 10 company. It has a half a million BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: MALE SPEAKER: And one of the like you said, perception is some points. And I've seen very technical through hard work and a lot understood the climate But then when they got to a lose some of that thing that Having the technical people technical and still understand, spreadsheets and finance So you being technical did you keep that? BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: I think to Google, which is a rare thing. They actually have two different engineering and one for And they do not cross And they never force anyone another, which is unusual. Typically, in a usual company, the ladder. And then in order to advance, And now you've-- BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Which BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --lost the you've gained the world's It's awful. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And then that BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: I think little bit. But I think there's always And to some extent, you To some extent, you can But it's very tricky. It really is. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: That's an social skills explicitly and relying on your technical meritocracy. I mean, it's an argument, I need to think about and focus BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. MALE SPEAKER: OK. Thank you. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Thank you. Next, please. MALE SPEAKER: You touched your talk about this. But I was wondering if you recommendations for staying sane satellite office at BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: MALE SPEAKER: Yes. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Other applications of alcohol? No, kidding. That's a really good question. Are you talking about avoiding the darn time or--? MALE SPEAKER: Balancing the staying connected. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: That's MALE SPEAKER: You guys are BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well, yeah, book a little bit. One of the things that we I mean, the reason a lot of example, is they like people to in one place because there's face time, in having-- just being able to swivel around the right person right next to sending them an email the phone or whatever. You want the friction to One way we have found working been in that situation-- is to actually have, like, a in particular. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: One a Chromebook actually-- talk about IRC first, BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well, IRC, who remember what it is-- it's an actual group chat system chat, not IM with some party It's noticeably different. Everybody would literally just all day long, corner of their And that became-- for distributed team working in that became our substitute sit chairs around to talk You could fire a question Everybody would see it. Everybody would reply. And it creates, partially, that same room with everybody. It really helps. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: One of my lot of chat. But I gave them a Chromebook. And they set it up between And VC Chromebook to the other And they had that up pretty much way to just quickly grab BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It is head in the middle Like, is that your BRYAN FITZPATRICK: When people angry most of the time. But you have to use everything And the fact of the matter is engineers who are in the remote been in the remote office it takes more work. It takes more effort to get And the advantage of live where you want. So-- BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And we've made that tradeoff. And we've built an engineering help of a lot of other people. But it's never friction-free And you're still gonna have to MALE SPEAKER: Thanks. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We're almost out of time here. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Almost BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Want BRYAN FITZPATRICK: One Anyone? BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We'll go want to ask more questions. BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah. We'll head out in the hall But thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it. BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Thank you.
