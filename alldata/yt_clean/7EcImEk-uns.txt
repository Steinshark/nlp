Which of the most expensive Let's talk about that. Good Mythical Morning. Blank dollar foot long. Five dollar foot long. Wrong. Eight dollar foot long? Ten dollar. Nope. Fifteen dollar. Nope. Thirty dollar. Wrong. Actually, I don't know. But I do know that it's significantly In fact, the prices on fast food menu items especially on some of the Could you imagine if we gathered items and put them under the I've been imagining it for years. It's time for The Fast Food Bling Boys That's Us. We're The Fast Food Bling Boys. Okay, you're going to be tasting the highest most popular fast food restaurants, and then you'll try to match If you fail to match at least four, there will be extensive consequences There always are. We are starting with Wendy's the Pretzel Baconator, which they describe as. It's a Baconator. Half pound of fresh, American cheese, six strips of crispy ketchup and mayo. Behemoth you know and love. But now, you can't top a Baconator. So, we twisted it. This is the most Wow. Apparently. Boy, this is. Meat's expensive. Bacon's, six slices. Pretzels is expensive. Yep. It is heavy. How does it taste? I've always liked a Baconator. I like this. But the pretzel bun is not an improvement. I-M-O-H? Yeah. I-M-H-O. Unless you said, in my opinion, humbly. That's what it is. Now, listen, back here, we have prices, and when this came in, I noticed something. Yeah. The prices are all over the place. Like, this is twelve ninety-nine. This is ten forty-nine. Seventeen seventy-nine. This is hurting you, isn't it? I can't figure out which direction it goes, because this is the cheapest eight twenty-nine. This is the most expensive of all them. Is this just, this is a random placement. Random. All right. But I think this is. What am I gonna do? I believe that this is It's the most expensive thing at Wendy's, Yeah, but there's eight. There's ten. There's ten. There's look, there's three tens. I know. So you're feeling ten dollars? It's not seventeen dollars. There's no way. It's not thirteen dollars. It's not thirteen. Well, how much is a normal Baconator? A normal Baconator is probably. Nine dollars. Seven sixty-one. So you're at ten forty-nine right now. Let's. Okay, we can. We can move these around. All right, And. Yeah, it's. I don't love the pretzel. There's so many good burgers now. I just gotta say, the way that there's been a it's very difficult to go, to go get a drive-thru burger. It's just real hard to convince yourself. Unless it's Shake Shack or In-N-Out, sorry to say, guys. Move on. That's where we're at, next. Next up is Subway's most a footlong size The Beast, which they describe as the sandwich going to sleep every night. That's. That's a good one. Hunger, fear. Oh, I wanted to. I wanted to do a little thing for you. Do it for me then. Here you go, Rhett. I did it for you. That's my half. I see tomatoes, on the other half. Well, you did one that turned it around. You did one. So, it's got. This can't be expensive. Look at that. It just looks like a normal sub. I mean, it. I don't know if my hunger is Roast beef, turkey. It claims to have half a pound of meat and. Salami. Two times the amount of the toppings. Pepperoni. It doesn't look like that. It doesn't have twice Well, it's supposed to. But maybe when you ask an employee they're like, I doubt it. I mean, it's got all the meats that Subway has to offer I believe. This is the best meat that they have. The pepperoni. I'm just. When is the last time you know? Come on, Subway, wow me. Come on. Pull me back in. I'm not. I'm pulling for you. I'm not, but I'm saying that I am. If a foot long was five dollars. Five dollar foot long. At some point. That's a joke. In the past five years, maybe. And then twice the toppings, well, it increased probably to six fifty, maybe seven. Yeah, but five dollar foot longs That doesn't exist. Right, but I'm just. Yeah, exactly. I'm saying they're seven fifty now. Okay. And then I'm saying then This is in the. This is either. This is either the eight dollar one. It's gonna be eight twenty-nine. Or we move the Baconator to ten seventy Well. I just don't know what the cheapest, Oh, that's hard to think about. But I feel like this. Cheapest, most expensive. This is the, Yeah. It's Subway. It's Subway. It's supposed to be cheap. But I'll also do this. I'll move the Wendy's to ten seventy. Why'd you do that? Because you titillated me. Oh, I don't wanna titillate you. But you did. I only wanna titillate myself. Okay. You're such a dirty person. What are you talking about? I'm comfortable with my sexuality. It's not dirty to do it, Titillate just means to provoke a sense of anticipatory pleasure. It doesn't mean I don't I can titillate myself with simply a look. All right, fine. I'm moving it back. That's what you get. I've moved it back. I can just. I've moved it back. I can just pass myself in the Oh, gosh. Next up is Taco Bell's a Cantina Chicken Bowl. Oh, this is new on the Cantina menu. This is supposed to be something that's healthier for you. So you've got these. It's their imitation of Chipotle, right? Chipotle bowl. Why is it dangling like that? Cheese, bro. Okay. I didn't know there was cheese in it. Yeah. Utterly flavorless. Oh, it's not bad. Well, and it might not be, I'm just thinking about Taco Bell. I'm thinking about things Not in a tortilla, just in a. In a bowl. I mean, that's a disappointment, man. If you want that, go to Chipotle. But Chipotle and Taco Bell, It's not the same ballgame. I mean, this is the cheapest thing up It's gotta be the eight twenty-nine, I mean, It has to be. I agree with that. So if we move that to ten seventy, we move that there. Maybe even there. And then we move the. The burgers are square. I feel great about this. Don't forget that. Does that inform the pricing? Well. Or just a hazard? A square and a circle next to each other There's more meat in the square. We know this. Yeah, there's more meat in the square. More meat in the square. That's what they almost, almost was their slogan. More meat in the square. More meat in the square. Then it became, where's the beef? Hey, you know, we have a podcast together. It's called Ear Biscuits, where two lifelong friends talk And we wanted to remind you lives right here on YouTube, on the Ear Biscuits channel. New videos every Wednesday. We get into it. So get into it with us Yes, please. All right. Jack in the Box. And this is a Bacon Double Smashed Jack. I've seen this advertised on their windows. They're trying to do what? They're trying to address the thing Yeah, they did. And I don't know if they have, I mean, is this a smash burger? Well, it's so hard. Yeah. I mean, it's so hard to get that, like, really, really flattened out thing. You know, it's just a lot to ask They don't have time to smash. But it's pretty. I mean, it's got a lot of. What do you call that? Where they start breaking Oh, yeah. Like the lace. The lace on the side. They want some lace, This is apparently a limited time item, on it. I don't know what that means. It's not as good as a It's pretty good for a fast food burger. Yeah, it's pretty good. I like that Boss Sauce. It's very orange. There's a lot of meat here. That might be a half pound of meat. This might be the same amount of And there is. I think it's a little. Less bacon. Right. I think that this is putting me. Lower than Wendy's. Because you're saying. Boom, boom. Like the cost of ingredients? Yes. Because they're all buying It's not like they got cheaper cows somewhere, right? So the cost of adding a pig to that one is putting There is a pig on this one. Yeah, there is. It's bacon. But there's more pig on this one. Can we use the pork term? Pork. I'm really curious what. What's going to be at the? There's also a twelve ninety-nine. Like, if nothing crazy comes out, We're really underestimating how Maybe. We don't know. We're just really shy to That's a problem for us. I mean, we. But we're admitting it. But we are openly admitting it And we want to get better. We're having a real tough time, guys. You know what? We're not perfect. I'm really freaking out on the inside, We got our hang ups. Yeah. This is one of Panda Express's A Honey Walnut Shrimp bowl. It's tied with the Black Firecracker Shrimp Bowl. But we like this one the best. So, look at that candied walnut. And then you've got the shrimp. I'm always tempted to get this, I'm like, oh, that's too expensive. I gotta get. Is that really the No, the real reason is Okay. Okay. Thanks for being real with us. I like walnuts, though. How many fast food places have walnuts, Maybe on a salad. I'd say less than twelve percent. At Wendy's? There's no way this is I'll tell you that right now. Because it's mostly just. Rice. Rice. I mean. But shrimp. Once you get through this stuff, nothing but rice. There's no shrimp hidden down in there. But shrimp are expensive because Have you ever tried to chase one down? You got to use both hands. Yeah. Well, you really got to have two guys or. Or, like, two anybody, right? It doesn't have to be two guys. It's just two people. Right? One guy that's like. You really could have one to be honest with you. I'll be the dog. That's swimming. I'm like. Right? I'm swim. I'm sending the shrimp. You need a shrimp glove. Do we have one? Do we have a shrimp glove. Do we have a shrimp glove? Okay, I'll pantomime. It just is a regular glove that's sort of advertised And it's a color that doesn't scare them. And basically it's like that. There you go. Basically, that's how it works. I really thought that. You see how hard we had to do? Took about one minute to get one shrimp. I thought, this is a candidate for this. But there's not enough shrimp. To justify that cost. No way. If it's seventeen seventy-nine. But we feel good about thirteen. Thirteen? Well, what. What would be more than thirteen? It's just shrimp. Maybe that Pretzel Baconator. Nobody's gonna pay thirteen at Wendy's. No one is going to do that. Burgers are all in the ten dollar range. I'm just making stuff up at this point. There is a perception that you should pay a little There's no drive-thru. Oh, gosh. We lost one. And finally, it's Burger King's most A Triple Whopper. It is heavy. Link, we are so wrong so far, man. Well, you're the one who's saying a I was wrong. Good gosh. Does yours have tomato? Yep. So does mine. Does it have way too much mayonnaise? Because it's from Burger King? Burger King, yeah. Yes. I mean, how do they consistently do that? Just. It's like a lettuce mayo, slurry. Do they just have a vat of that? Like a mayo drenched lettuce vat? I like it, though. Hot lettuce. Good. Burger King. Just tastes like Burger King. It doesn't taste like anything else. It's so specific. I'm trying to figure out where That's a lot of meat, man. Having tasted all of the most I'm not impressed. I mean, the most expensive things based on what I've experienced today. I don't disagree with you. This is too much Burger too tightly. It's huge. It might be. Is it more meat? Why would you do this to yourself? Of course there's no cheese on it because we forgot to order it with cheese. Because that's what we Well, we didn't want to put any extras Yeah, but a Triple Whopper with Exactly, which is why we couldn't put cheese I wasn't critiquing us. I was critiquing Burger King by making And that irks me. Which one has more meat? Because this one has circle meat. That's three, but wider and thinner. Bigger circles, smaller squares. This one has taller, fatter squares. Triple Whopper has more meat. Yeah, but. Yeah, but it doesn't have. It's not seventeen dollars. No, no, no. The shrimp's seventeen dollars. The shrimp has to be seventeen dollars. It's gotta be. It's shrimp. They're hard to catch. You saw how it was. That right there with the walnuts? I mean, give me a break. You think that? Do you think that? I think that the Baconator is more expensive than the Triple Whopper, Do you think that it's two dollars Because that's what you're about to say. Do you think The Beast? Do you think that Subway thinks dollars for that thing? Hell, no. Are the burgers all in Which would make sense. What I'm saying is, You think that the Baconator I think. How could they do that? I think that they know that they So. To keep people away from it? Yep. I'm going back. I'm going back on what I said earlier, Well, because it's more meat. Well, which is the one I said. But we're agreeing for different reasons. Right? Let's think about this for a second. Yes. Yes. Do you want to know before you rearrange Yeah. If you want. If you want. If you're willing to tell us. Yeah. You have two, correct. Okay. Only two? All right, so we've got this right. We got that right. And I think that somehow. How could anything be cheaper? All right. Only thing we got right are these two. Yep. And I'm telling you. I'm telling you right now, Because they're idiots. And then. Okay, And so what that does. No, no, no. Hold on. You just put. You put the Triple Whopper Wrong. Yeah. So now we want the Jack in the Box. Jack in the Box? Oh, Jack in the Box There. Jack in the Box. Hold on. Was it just there? It wasn't there. And then. And then that's the. This is the Whopper. That's the Baconator. We are locked in. Okay, I'm going to reveal from Okay. Eight twenty-nine is our cheapest one, Taco Bell's Cantina Chicken Bowl. There it is. Ten forty-nine is Wendy's Pretzel Baconator. Holy moly. Well, which is a good deal these days. Ten seventy is Panda Express's Honey Walnut Shrimp Bowl. Something's going to be If it's Subway. If it's Subway. Don't you do it. Ten eighty-nine is Jack in the Box Twelve ninety-nine is Burger King's Triple Whopper, which means seventeen seventy-nine The Beast, Subway. Okay. Subway, come on. Pull up a chair. You do it. You're so consistently disappointing. What? What in the actual hell, Subway? What in the actual fiery people screaming and gnashing of I am so sorry for you. I'm insulted for me. What are you doing with all these profits? You think that? Not making better stuff. Who do you think is gonna buy this? What? Seventeen seventy-nine. What?
