My friend really needs your help so she can move on from the situation. Sincerely, Dominique.&quot; I need to know what you've been Give us the full story from the beginning with all the ups and downs. - So I met BJ on Instagram in 2014. From there, we exchanged phone numbers and we were talking on We were very flirty, but I was busy talking to people at home. But whenever I stopped talking to the person that I was talking to, I always went back to talking to BJ. Me and BJ got back in contact and we exchanged numbers all over again because he told me he That was around the time I was at a party. Next thing I know, the and I was shot multiple times. One through my stomach, one in my shoulder, and - My God. - [Danielle] It was like the main artery in my neck and two inches away from my heart. - (sighs) That's horrible. I can't even imagine something like that. - When was that? - In a couple of days, it'll be two years. It was very hard. It was a long process. But BJ was there for me and like he would answer my phone call, whether it was 4:00 in the He really was keeping me afloat while I was going through because I didn't have As I got better, we had spoken about, you know, meeting up and everything. So I decided to fly down there. But when I got there, he - Were you pissed? I would be like... - I was mad, but I was worried. - Yeah. - The first time for somebody to do that and to offer to let you stay I'm thinking something is wrong. I went back home, I contacted him, and he told me he got called - Couldn't just text you? - Yeah. - I was livid. But I was also, at that point, I'm like, &quot;Okay, maybe it was He didn't think about it.&quot; I wouldn't do that. That's but it is what it is. - Okay. - The next time that I he was in Atlanta and I already had plans from I get to Atlanta. Completely disappears. - What was his excuse that time? - He got caught up. He just - &quot;I'm sorry. I got busy?&quot; - [Danielle] He got busy. - Oh, that would've - But then even I tried and he told me like, oh, - This is still a thing people are saying. - No, listen, I stopped talking to him and then I started dating - Oh! Okay, good. - That ended and it was like Slide back in the DMs, &quot;Let me start liking her pictures again.&quot; - They always do, child. It's They just know. - [Danielle] That's what I'm saying. - How does he keep winning you back? - I've had... I had a rough couple years At this point, like, I have to meet him. - [Nev] Is that him? - [Kamie] I can't tell. (suspenseful music) - [Nev] Whoa, whoa, whoa. I think that's him. - Is that? That is him. - [Nev] What's up? - BJ, right? - So that's you. - Kamie. Nice to meet you. - [Nev] Obviously you know Danielle. - Yeah. - We're all ears. We're very eager to find out And so the real reason that you encouraged her to and then decided not to meet You were nervous? - I wanted you to come, but I never was gonna go through with it. - (laughs) Yeah. - I wasn't in a place for you to come. - Why? - Because like she like extravagant things and I was already telling You feel me? I felt like I needed to say I didn't have no things to So that's a big lie. I got a But the laundromat thing, I - Wait, wait, wait. that would be something that - [Nev] Danielle, were you in his money or something? - [Danielle] No. - I feel like if I lied that she would be still fond of me. Felt bad that I ghosted her. - But not bad enough to show up. - Couldn't you have at &quot;Oh (bleep), I just got called on a job.&quot; Like just give, just to let her know so she doesn't fly all the way down there? - Like you didn't realize that before I came down here? - It's not that I have it together. You know what I'm saying? I'm upcoming. You know what I'm saying? Ain't like I have it together. It's that everything I And once you see that, that's a... You weren't... You'd be turned off. You - I don't understand why you lied. You didn't even have to make it seem like it was something else. - I feel like I did. - I just really wanna What's true and what things aren't true that she doesn't know are lies? Can you kind of just clear - Everything is a lie. You're a liar. - Everything is not a lie. Me living an extravagant that's a lie. Everything else, how I I said things to keep you around. - Bro, I don't even have all the things that you're trying to - [Kamie] Were you just waiting until the business grew and - Yeah, I didn't want to meet like this. - [Nev] &quot;Can I trust him?&quot; &quot;Hey, hey Nev and Kamie.&quot; - Hey, hey! - &quot;My name is Jasmine I'm a single mother of two living in Baltimore, Maryland.&quot; - My home state!

He is tall, handsome, He treats me so well. I really love him.&quot; To my soul &quot;But this man hasn't yet FaceTimed me and I haven't seen him in person. Every time I ask to meet up, he would tell me he's going and that it would be soon. The worst part is back a few months ago, he ghosted me for an entire month. Blocked me on Insta, everything. Then he came back and and apologized. I was ready to move on, but he promised nothing and told me he wanted to be with me.&quot; Ooh baby you fill my soul &quot;I'm so in love with him, What's the problem? I think I found my king and I can't wait to Thank you.

So I swiped right too and then we started communicating (bright music continues) and then we exchanged numbers and we just started texting from there. (bright music continues) In the beginning, I had His voice is so country. He's funny. He calls me - [Nev] He can't meet, won't FaceTime, And you said he also blocked you once? What was that about? - In January, he ghosts me. - Exactly. And then a month later - Do you have it? - I wanna see. - (sighs) Starting right there. - Okay. Okay, so he blocked you totally, and then literally a month You randomly just get a, &quot;Hey After he had not responded and also blocked you on Instagram? - He blocked me from the phone and he blocked me from Instagram. - &quot;I just was dealing and I treated you so wrong and I hate that I put you through that. You didn't deserve that and - You said, &quot;I don't hate Why? Because my love was - [Nev] He said, &quot;Of course I do. It hurts knowing I hurt I'll never leave you again.&quot; - Exactly. - And since then he hasn't? - None. (line ringing) Wait a minute.

But you know I'm outta there. I'm done. I love you. My Everything's real. Nothing's fake. - [Nev] If that's true, why did you send us to a park yesterday and then not show up? - I mean, the plan yesterday was, I mean, for me to come see you. - Right. - But I felt a kind of So that kinda made me real, like, nervous. But today I had the courage and I was like, &quot;Man, and I don't want to really - [Nev] Okay, but who's Nelly? - Oh, that's my cousin. - [Nev] This is his house? - I was just overthinking a lot, man. And you know, I just, I put myself in a tight - It's just an interesting when we arrived. - [Kamie] 'Cause we were about to leave. - Yeah. And it's... I don't know, man. I think I was just still a little jittery, but, you know, I brung myself. This is what I want. This is real. And I wanna put that behind me. - Let me try and get this - Yes, my name Ryan. - 31 years old. - Most, if not everything, about yourself is true? - Yeah, everything is true. - What she didn't know - I was in a marriage. - You were married. And - No. No kids. - How long were you married for? - Four years. - If you'd been honest when I imagine you would've - Yeah. If he came to me in the beginning. Like, I was honest with you, that was something you - Yeah, I just, I was afraid. But, I mean, it's over now. I have no relations or no Jasmine, I love you. It's nothing else that I want. You give me all the proper feelings that I want from a woman. Seeing you just solidifies and secures it. And please, just understand - I mean, he seems like a good guy, right? - I think so. - I love you and I really (tender music) Please. - All right. (tender music continues) - I mean, I'm happy. So what do we do now? - [Kamie] Could we go inside? - Okay, great. I just think there's a Okay. - How you feeling? - I feel okay. Just... I still got questions. You blocked me for a whole month. Was you still living with..? - I was still living with her, but the marriage, it just wasn't working. So I moved back in with my parents and, you know, my dad, he went to prison and my mother, she got sick. You know, things was just real difficult. So I just blocked you like a, you know, making an immature mistake. - So when you came back, - My intention was always to meet you. I just, you know, I had so much going on. I was just being selfish I knew what you'd been through and you know, you know, I just... I don't wanna put you You know, I'm much more, you know, wiser than I was when we first met. - Do you feel like you have - Yes, I have closure. - Can you see yourself marrying again? - Yes, I can. I really can. They say the first one, you know, you learn from the first one. I know how to treat a And I thank God for, you know, allowing this to happen for real. - Me too. - [Nev] &quot;Dear Nev and Kamie, My name is Reign, she/her. I'm 20, live in Houston, and currently work at a pizza restaurant.&quot; - I wonder if they have gluten-free crust. - [Nev] &quot;I started being I felt isolated and alone and spent most of my free Being part of these fandoms felt very much like a home for me. Seven years ago, I after he made a funny He was two years older than me, but we immediately became best friends. We were talking to each other daily and we even stayed up I was secretly convinced but I understood it because he lived in London.&quot; - Piers from London? Tear us apart, ah, ah I wanted only you &quot;Also, Piers has always been mysterious. He wouldn't tell me his last name and the page we talked He also had a habit of going with no explanation. After some time, the and I thought I had lost him. But a few weeks ago, after four years, we finally reconnected. Now I was so happy to hear from him and this feels like an to find out who he is and I hope to hear from you. Love, Reign.&quot; - I met Piers when I was My friend Sam had a meme and Piers commented and I responded and we started talking on direct message and our friendship took off after that. - Tell us about Piers. - I know that he lives in London. He is two years older - Okay. At what point in your back and forth did it feel like it was - I feel like right off the bat, it felt like we were both - Even though you hadn't seen each other? - Yeah, like, I knew and that's why I was - [Nev] So there was a strong before you even knew what he looked like. - Yeah. - Did you guys ever talk or you going to London or - We made jokes about it, but we weren't ever because we were kids and we didn't have the money and the time. Of course, like, when we're older but I don't think we were - Yeah. - But then he started disappearing for weeks, months at a time. (tense music) - What happened when he came - When he came back, he It was, it just went back from where it, like, stopped. So then it happened again and it was just a constant of like disappearing in and out. - And how long did that go on for? - It happened like three or four times and then he disappeared for - And no explanation any of these times? Did you ever confront him? Were you ever like, &quot;Where for the past how many months?&quot; - No, because all I have is love for him. I couldn't get it out of my head. - [Kamie] Right. - [Nev] So tell us more that you and Piers were in. - Well, so in the group chat, it was Samantha, Piers, my friend Chloe, and my other friend John. And we were all like a family. Well, it was like a family to me. - Who brought everybody - Samantha. - [Nev] How did you get connected - I met her in the fandom. - And all of these other people, you also have not met them in real life? So it was all through - So of all the people in the group chat, have you talked to any - Um, I've FaceTimed Chloe. I'm - Are you still in contact - [Reign] No, Sam went MIA and John as well. - But it's not that these were teenage fandom accounts. They maybe just sort of moved on. But now he's back and acting like nothing ever happened. - Yeah, it's weird. (suspenseful music) - [Kamie] Do you see that person? - Who is that? - [Kamie] Here we go. - [Nev] Oh, is that her? She looks like she's alone. - [Kamie] Interesting. (suspenseful music continues) - [Nev] Hi. Chloe? - Hey! Hi, lady. - [Reign] Oh my God, you're so cute! - My goodness girl. It's - Nice to meet you. - [Chloe] Nice to meet you guys. - Thanks for, uh... - Good to see you guys here. - [Kamie] Good to see you. - [Kamie] I didn't think 'cause you didn't text us back. - Um, I thought that I like have all of us be here But it didn't work out that way. - [Nev] I mean, I know we had asked about trying to get in touch with him, but like was that the only reason you were trying to get him here or was it because you that we don't know? - I do. (laughs) - [Chloe] I do. So, Reign, there have been some things 'cause we were just kids and it was a long-ass (bleep) time ago. I had a bunch of fandom accounts and when I met you first, it was through a different account. - Are we talking about the Piers account? - That's what I'm alluding to. Yeah. - So you are Piers? - Yes. When all of this occurred, I was 12 and it was just an online Most of the stuff that happened on those was role playing anyway. And once I, like, noticed that you kind of liked that account, that's when I stopped Then I became more distant 'cause I was like, &quot;Okay, well that's kind of like an area that I don't want to touch.&quot; - Why didn't you tell me? - I don't know. I was a kid. And I didn't think any of it would matter. I honestly did not think you and I would still be - But now you're not a - She's not a kid either. Yeah. - [Kamie] Right. Exactly. And when she saw the Piers profile suddenly follow her again she's thinking like, &quot;This person that I had is back in my life.&quot; Why did you pop back up as Piers? - [Chloe] So when I was digging through my Instagram accounts like two months ago, I was like, &quot;Okay, let I would check on it like once a year, whenever I'd remember it exists, and it'd be like, &quot;Oh (bleep),&quot; you know? But I didn't mean to follow I honestly don't really But I'm sorry that I put you through any of that emotional distress. - So what made you talk to her account instead of just messaging her as you and being like, &quot;Hey just, haha, letting you know that account that you used was actually me.&quot; - Because I'd never thought we would meet. I'd never thought that to, like, break your heart about it. And it'd be easier to just be like, &quot;Oh, you know, miss you too,&quot; and then, like, just - Here's an email. &quot;Urgent! She just messaged &quot;Hey Nev and Kamie, my name is Leeandre. I'm 32, a single dad, and I'm an Uber driver - My home state! Maryland! - [Nev] &quot;Around four years ago, I met a girl named Russia on IMVU.&quot; - Our favorite. - Well, that's the thing where - Yeah!

She 'hired' me and I started Highlight of every day while I was on shift at the salon.&quot; To the sky We're burning til &quot;We talked a lot on IMVU, then eventually she gave me her number.&quot; Gave you all I got, got, got, got, got &quot;We exchanged pictures Soon after, we both decided and in real life.&quot; - Mmhmm. - &quot;We said 'I love you' and Unfortunately that didn't happen.&quot; - Surprise, surprise. - [Nev] &quot;We never ended up She came back into my life in 2022 and she claimed she had things going on with some of her family I certainly understood the and so we patched things up and tried to give it another shot. With ease, we picked things We even talked about our future and decided to get married on IMVU.&quot; Gave you all I got, got, got, got, got &quot;And eventually in real life too. But then a few months ago, she did it again.&quot; Where you be, be, be, be &quot;She ghosted me without warning. I was really out of sorts That's why I'm writing to you now. She reached out to me again No one has supported me like she does. I love her and want to be with her. I need your help finding I hope to hear from you soon. Leeandre.&quot; It's all I've got - [Leeandre] Me playing IMVU Like it was like an outlet. I started meeting people like it was like a chat room. Am I gonna wake up just It just gave me hope to - Yeah. - Meeting Russia was It was like the pinnacle. - [Nev] How often was she in the game? - It was like every day to the point where we got really close. I wish I wasn't scared to say The way I feel is not a game So I never thought I would Are we in a dream And then she ended up Are we in a dream Text messages at first. She sent me pictures and eventually it became phone calls.

Tell us about her. - She's like a fashionista. - She says she models in real life? - That's what she told me. She says she was like a and then when she told me she was like, &quot;Well I was in school cosmetology So, like, I don't really I tried to get, like, a FaceTime and she would make up &quot;Well, I just don't want And so that's when she - How long was she gone? - She was gone for two years. - [Nev] Two years? - Oh my God.

And then how, she came back? - Yeah, I get messages apologizing and saying why she ghosted - [Kamie] What did she say? - She said she had a lot - That's just strange. She was there for you through so much. You would think that she to say something about How did it end up after that? Like did you feel like - Yeah, much, much more closer. It felt like we both matured. So that's kind of why I like, I overlooked it the first time. - Yeah. - It was really strong. Like, we talked about having kids and we talked about marriage. The &quot;I love you&quot;s were coming in hard. - [Kamie] You're in love with her? - Yes. - You are currently in love? - But wait, how long were you then talking before she then ghosted you again? - That happened in February. - [Nev] So you two were before she ghosted you a - Yes. We were talking about linking up. She was actually supposed - [Nev] Oh. - But poof again, you know? And then she texted me again out the blue. - So are you excited? - I am.

Just what the heck's going on? - Well at that time when I ghosted him, I went through deaths in my family and it put me in depression mode.
