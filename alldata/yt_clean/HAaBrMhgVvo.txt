The cheerleader and the One of them could have done it. Oh, I thought the basketball player Why is he losing this? Okay, just do your best, math teacher. It does not look like that Oh, followed by the gamer. I really wish I could have I didn't even try. Remember, Done. Cheerleader wins. Done. And the gamer. Everyone, come over here. I guess I lost. But at least I lost to you. Keep going. This is a human ribbon challenge. The first to untangle their ribbon wins. If they win this, does that mean they get I hope not, because the gamer did it.

This is your id. Okay, you can leave. What's wrong with his face? He's having an allergic reaction. Well, get your medicine, you idiot. Okay, I was wrong about the lunch lady, I have a bad feeling but I need more evidence. So let's see security footage. Oh, there's a different camera angle. They're making a circle But wait, that's a really good circle. A perfect circle. Zamfam. I have the perfect challenge I just need to get them You're good. Wait, where is the math teacher? He said he went to the restroom. Everyone else, I'll meet you there. They said he was using the bathroom. Where's the door open? What is. What? What's going on? What is going on here? Please don't tell the principal. Tell the principal what? It's amazing. He wants us to end it. He makes me so angry. Okay, look, I'm not gonna say anything. You need to leave, and you need to head Sam fam, did you see how angry he got? The principal is making Do you think that's reason For this challenge, we're gonna see who can Why do we have to do this in detention? Well, you could just admit that you then we wouldn't have to do this. That's what I thought. Cheerleader is up first. This is like doing a cheer routine. Uh, well, you missed the bottom part. And up there, basketball player is next. I like the way your bow has matched your. Your skirt. Thank you. For you. Watch this. This is definitely not a circle. Where's my circle? Head over there. You're a math teacher, That's actually not even close. I'm just so used to using a protractor. Hey. Oh, that's actually not bad. What are you doing? Hold on. What is this? It's a star. Okay, okay, okay. Thank you. It was a circle challenge. Oh, my God. She is so crazy. Be quiet. She's gonna put a hex on you All right, nerd, let's see your circle. That is probably the Great job, nerd. Just head on over there. Of course he draws a perfect circle. Yeah, Last up, draw your circle. That's almost as good as mine. Hey, you messed me up. Mine would have been Well, it looks like the clear Come on up. Everyone else, head back to detention. Okay, look, I know you did it. You thrashed the principal's roof. Your calculations are incorrect. Oh, are they? I know for a fact because A perfect circle. That was also in the. The principal's office. And I saw the cheerleader slip I don't know what you're talking about. Okay, enough. Just show me the note. If you say anything, you will regret it. Regret what? I promise I won't say anything. Well, that sounds really sus. I bet you purposely ate cheese so but I am not falling for it. Show me your school id, It is your id card. I'm just good at circles because I You can go. Sam fam. I am running out of time, everyone is going to be arrested. I don't know what to do. Only 15 minutes left. Rebecca. She better hurry. And I better get my lunch. Even though the nerd is the he is not the one that did this. But the cheerleader is the which means that she could be the one sigma. Wait. Sigma's a good thing. If you don't like the principle, which means whoever did this clearly This is the gen alpha slang challenge. I'm gonna give you a word and You're gonna decide if that definition sponge and squeezing it into the bowl. Pay attention, because whoever gets the most gen trashed the principal's authorization. Let's start with our first word. Selling. The definition of selling is doing good. True or false? Everyone grab your sponge If it turns a color, Squeeze it in three, two, one. Preppy girl and math teacher, Selling means doing bad. He's actually selling right now. Give me a break. Next up, we have Ohio. The definition of Ohio is weird. True or false? Grab your sponge and squeeze it in. Three, two, one. It looks like cheerleader and You didn't know what Ohio was. It depends how you use it. Moving on to the next word. Rizzler. Someone who has no friends. Is that true or is that false? Goth girl and math teacher, That is not the correct definition. A Rizzler gets a lot of guys. That's why you don't know what it means. Don't make me put another hex on you. The next word is podium. And the definition is that something Is it true or false? Pick your sponge hey, you know, you're. Kind of a rizzler. Oh, really? You think so? Oh, thanks. Grab your sponges. Squeeze it in, three, two, one. It looks like everyone, got it right. That's so cringey. This word is sigma. The definition of sigma is a loser. You know, like the principle. Is that true or false? And squeeze it in three, two, one. Everyone got it right So everyone head out. Math teacher, I'd like to speak to you. It's me. I'm the problem. You are the problem. And you trashed the principal's office. What? You knew none of the gen Alpha slang. I know one word. You want revenge on the principal relationship with the lunch lady. That's preposterous. Show me your school id. Oh, you don't have it. I do have mine. Oh, why? Where is it? Where is it? It's right here. So you aren't the one Exactly. Okay, fine. You can go. Good. Cause I have a date with Give him my id. Sure. Okay. Don't say it. Zamfam. I know I'm wrong. I'm heading back to There must be more evidence. I definitely thought the math teacher Wrong, but it clearly wasn't him. Maybe there is some more footage. Okay, I'm running out of time. I need to find something. Another camera angle. The security guard's coming. He's gonna find it. They're hiding. He might find them. That was close. He almost went into the room. Clearly, they're scared because which means their heart I just need a challenge to see This is the never have I ever challenge. I will say a statement, and you have to say if Why do I have to wear these watches? Cause I thought they were cute. It doesn't even match. First question. Never have I ever had a first kiss. What they don't know is those watches so I can tell if they're long. Reveal your answers. I have. I have not. I have. I have. Sam fam. The basketball player's which means he is probably lying. I'm gonna question him. Basketball guy, Yeah. Uh huh. Was it. Was it a good first kiss? Oh. What. What was her name? Fine. I haven't. Oh, my God. Even weird goth girls had a kid. Next question. Never have I ever been I have not. I have. I have. The cheerleader's heart rate is going up. I have. She is definitely lying. So you. You. You've never been mad at the principal? No. Why would I have a Are you sure? Not even a little bit mad? Yes, I'm sure. She's definitely lying. Never have I ever failed a test. Of course she has. I have. I have not. Yeah, I have. I have. Preppy girl's heart rate is going up. Preppy girl? Are you sure you haven't failed a test? Yeah, I've never failed a test before. Are you sure? You seem, a little bit stressed right now. I'm not lying. The idea of failing really stresses me out. Yes, that stresses me out too. Never have I ever threatened someone. I have not. I have. I threatened my mom that but of course I did. I have not. I have. The cheerleader's heart rate is going up. We know she threatened the nerd. I just need to get her to admit it. Cheerleader, are you. Are you sure you've No, of course I wouldn't. Not someone, maybe not as cool as you. Someone, who draws perfect circles and like that. What? I don't know if I believe you. Fine. The principal accused me of and he suspended me, I was not expecting that. I was talking about the nerd. This makes her look even more sus. Never have I ever ditched class. I have not. I have not. I have not. Arkhouse, is clearly lying. Not only is his heart rate going up, but we know the math teacher You have a ditch class? Never before. That's actually funny, because the math teacher said Where were you? Fine. I was putting a teddy bear in her locker. It's her birthday this weekend. So that's all you were doing? I'm getting a ton of info right now, but nothing that's gonna help me figure I need a juicier question. Never have I ever been betrayed. A best friend. I have not. I have not. Nope. Have not. I have not. The cheerleader is definitely lying again. Are you sure you've never Yeah, I haven't. Liar. We used to be best but then we got to high school, so she made a rumor. And the principal believed you over me. And I will never forgive her for that... Whatever. You're the weird one. The goth girl just revealed but most importantly, the reason that she would I think she might be guilty. But I need to ask one more question. Never have I ever put I have not. I have not. I have not. This feels very targeted. You know what? I think I've seen all I need to. Everyone head back to detention. Except you. Why? Because you threatened the gamer You are good at drawing circles. And most importantly, you wanted revenge on the principal which is why you trashed his office. I didn't, but I wish I did. Then show me your school id. It's been fun. Not really. I can't believe the Which means it has to be There's gotta be something I'm missing. Wait. The basketball guy said he left a stuffed I should make sure that he's Okay, so this is the cheerleaders locker. The basketball player This is definitely from him. Look, BP basketball player. Okay, maybe there's something else. This is the exact paper that she Why does she have so much of this paper? Hold on, Zamfam. This looks just like the photo And she x'd out his eyes. I need to get back. Ten minutes left. Rebecca. I don't think she's gonna make it. Maybe there's something here. This is interesting. Okay, maybe I just need to go back and look at to see if I missed anything. Okay, they're walking in. They catch the spray paint, Hold on, Zamfam. Maybe it wasn't the speed that I needed to look at. This is dodgeball, Easy. Who are we playing against? You're playing against them. Is everyone ready?.. Yes. On your mark, get set. Gray dodgeball. Zamfam, comment below why you think I am confident at the end of this, I will know who trashed That was a great duck. Thank you... Oh, basketball player, you are out. Guess he shouldn't have been flirting. Oh, preppy girl. Caught it. Which means. Security guards, you are out. And she just got taken out by Matt. Head on over. We are down to our final two. Who's gonna get it? Whoa. Oh, man. Whoa. Ooh. Cheerleader is the All three of you are suspects, but only one of you trashed And that person is you, preppy girl. Me? The only reason you didn't win the cheerleader tripped you. Then you framed the gamer by dropping You love Lunchley, but the only reason you didn't win that nerd when he had an allergic reaction. And he's the one that startled which is why your circle wasn't perfect. I knew the gen Alpha slang. Yes, because you cheated by using your phone. Your heart rate went up. When I asked if you had failed you said you had threatened your mom. But I think it was the principal. It wasn't me. And I might have believed that because whoever trashed the principal's And you are the only one that And I found one more thing. This is your test where you got an f. Fine. It was me. I wanted the principal to change my grade, An f would look terrible on my GPA. Show me your school id. I don't have it. There's just one more question that I had. Why did you threaten the nerd? It was because he's and I don't want my parents to find out. Okay, okay. Time's up. Time's up. I want to know who trashed my office. It was preppy girl. I'm really sorry. I'll clean it up, I promise. Normally, but I'm gonna let it slide this one time, because I am really No. Joe. Security. Take her away. Everybody else, detention solar. Get out of here. I did it. Zamfamouse, go back and see if you And be sure to get detention Do it. It's add me.
