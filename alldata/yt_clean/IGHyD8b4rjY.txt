AND I'LL TELL YOU AHEAD OF TIME, BUT THAT'S THE POINT, BUT WE GET WHAT JESUS DESERVES. [MUSIC] JOYCE: OKAY, THIS WEEKEND WHAT MUST I DO TO PLEASE GOD? I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, 'CAUSE GOD TAUGHT ME A LOT OF MY YEARS AS A CHRISTIAN PLEASING GOD. AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT PLEASING HIM ABOUT. IT WAS JUST KIND OF THIS VAGUE NOW, PART OF IT PROBABLY CAME BECAUSE MY FATHER WAS VERY EASY TO MAKE ANGRY. AND SO, I ALWAYS KIND OF HAD WAS MAD AT ME. AND SO, THE FIRST THING I WANT IS SOME GOOD NEWS, SEE, YOU'RE NOT AS HAPPY [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: I THINK A LOT OF US, OF HOW GOD FEELS ABOUT US, FORGIVENESS, AND MERCY, AND HOW MUCH GOD LOVES US. AND IT'S MUCH EASIER TO PLEASE AND SO, I'M GONNA SHARE WITH YOU PLEASING GOD--WHAT MUST YOU THAT EVER BEEN A QUESTION THAT YOU WANNA DO KIND OF HALFWAY AND I WONDER IF, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, &quot;HAVE I READ ENOUGH?&quot; YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALWAYS THINKING, WILL BE PLEASED.&quot; ABOUT OUR DOING, AND WHAT HE WANTS US TO DO, NOT TRY TO DO SOMETHING BUT TO BELIEVE IN WHAT IN THE BIBLE--YOU CAN READ SOME REPORTS SAY THERE'S 7,000 BUT I'M GONNA TAKE SEVEN, 7,000. AND GOD JUST WANTS CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW YOUR LIFE 7,000 OF THE PROMISES IN HERE? AND REALLY, BUT REALLY, THE BIBLE SAID ABOUT YOU. SOME OF THOSE SCRIPTURES YOU CONFESS, JUST THAT ONE THAT, CHRIST, WHO IS MY STRENGTH.&quot; TO GET UP EVERY DAY AND NOT HAVE AND TO BELIEVE THAT WHATEVER YOU THE STRENGTH TO FACE IT, WE NEVER KNOW FOR SURE WHAT'S AND--BUT GOD WILL HELP US, TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO. BUT HE WANTS US TO BELIEVE IT. SO, IN HEBREWS 11:6, SCRIPTURE FOR THIS SERIES, FAITH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEASE FOR WHOEVER WOULD COME THAT GOD EXISTS AND THAT WHO EARNESTLY AND DILIGENTLY NOW, WE CAN ZIP RIGHT THROUGH MUCH MISS EVERYTHING SO, WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT APART DIFFERENT MESSAGES. &quot;WITHOUT FAITH IT'S IMPOSSIBLE HE WANTS US TO BELIEVE HIM, THAT HE EXISTS, THAT HE IS. AND NOT JUST THAT HE'S BUT HE IS WITH US ALL THE TIME [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] JOYCE: ALWAYS. THAT YOU CANNOT HIDE FROM GOD. THERE'S NOWHERE THAT YOU CAN BECAUSE HE IS THE GREAT &quot;I AM.&quot; BUT &quot;I AM.&quot; IN EVERYTHING IN OUR LIFE. THINGS THAT YOU WOULD THINK DOESN'T WANNA BE INVOLVED IN, INTO THOSE THINGS, WE WOULD WE'RE DOING WITHOUT, IN JAMES 4:2, IT SAYS VERY BECAUSE YOU ASK NOT.&quot; BECAUSE YOU ASK NOT. AND I'M JUST TELLING EVERY ONE MORE THAT GOD WANTS MORE THAT HE WANTS YOU AND I'LL TELL YOU AHEAD OF TIME, BUT THAT'S THE POINT, BUT WE GET WHAT JESUS DESERVES.

AND JESUS PAID A BIG PRICE BIG LIVES, NOT JUST BARELY BUT YOU HAVE TO ASK, IN HEBREWS 4:15 AND 16 IT SAYS, UNDERSTANDS OUR WEAKNESSES HE HAS BEEN TEMPTED, JUST LIKE THEREFORE, BECAUSE &quot;COME BOLDLY TO THE THRONE.&quot; TO THE THRONE. EVEN THOUGH HE, &quot;UNDERSTANDS &quot;COME BOLDLY TO THE THRONE, AND GRACE IN PLENTY OF TIME THE BEST TIME TO PRAY [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] JOYCE: AMEN?
