European countries permitted deemed disrespectful towards the Prophet. In Tehran, their embassies The police can easily be overrun. Most of these youths close to the Iranian government, they appear to have arrived there Suddenly, a tear gas grenade erupts, The gas is horrendous, The crowd is scattering. A door swings open, adjacent to the embassy, It's two in the morning The attackers did not exceed the limit Beyond the physical damage, For the flashes of photographers Everything appeared Back to the hotel. In my room, videos play about the Islamic Revolution. A familiar face reemerges, l'ayatollah Khomeini, the revered religious leader after an extended exile in France to establish an Islamic Republic. Today, the most hardline Ayatollahs remain in power. He's their nominee, Mahmud Ahmadinejad, who, to widespread surprise, 27 years after the Islamic Revolution, It is still the religious leaders It's always the same rhetoric, that I hear during the anniversary The greatness of Iran, and the hostility towards Israel. [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] Today, these slogans an extreme fundamentalist who, has been stirring up the masses with the denial of the Holocaust, by the Nazis during World War II. Today, some individuals assert the Holocaust indeed took place and we ought to believe them without posing any questions to us. This is a perspective originating because simultaneously, If you truly wish to witness Go and investigate the situation in Iraq. [Arabic spoken language] Beyond these assaults against America has set a new mandate for his country: Upon my arrival in Tehran, by portraits of Ayatollah Khomeini that glorify war and sacrifice. A foreign journalist can't work here without the Department of Guidance a type of propaganda ministry. Right off the bat, they assign me I found out that the intelligence services -Good morning. Where are you from? Do you have authorization What is that, the local police? You must go see the manager. I have a letter It enabled us to film throughout Iran. I do not want to get in trouble But I also belong to the special force. Every single one of my movements I will be under surveillance [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] Based on the messages France is not popular. The entire district of Tehran University is encircled by the Bassij, However, it's just the main Friday prayer The moment we begin filming, No, no, not here. It's prohibited. You are not allowed to film in this area. We are escorted to the security office. I have been asked to delete the footage [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] Delete that! That's what I'm doing. The Central University For 27 years, have been determining the future of Iran. [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] Everyone is awaiting the speech from the spokesperson particularly following the remarks opposing Iran's nuclear aspirations. When the crowd is well arangued, the ayatollah Mohamed Kashani, immediately targets France. You, the foolish French, and you, Chirac, who considers yourself as the president are you labeling us as terrorists? Do you believe we live But as always, For it is you, indeed you, And your nights of excess With Saddam Hussein, and with America mired in Iraq, The Islamic Republic has stirred up [Arabic spoken language] After the speeches and symbols, which advocates for a protest Three days ago, the building was targeted This time, the Iranian response forces A hundred militiamen have convened to voice objections who is apprehensive Once again, [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] The tricolor flag is ripped apart Among the throng, The sole religious individual He may be behind the scenes, but it seems [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] This religious figure is involved A few days prior, when the European flags were desecrated and the French colors ablaze. This Mullah's name is Said Naini. He devotes his life to loudly proclaiming but he is not shy. The following day, he agreed Mullah Naini is not just he is also a provocateur In the car, the Mullah is displeased Do you have any other way to film me? Here, there is nothing worth filming What is your profession? Well, nothing really, I don't work I engage in religious propaganda. I am simply fulfilling my Islamic duty I am not reliant on any organization. For someone who doesn't work, Comfortable home in Tehran, american style kitchen. That day, but the reception is courteous, This way, sir, please. [Arabic spoken language] For the interview, we settled in, sitting How did you come to be religious? I became an imam out of love Drawing nearer to religion, have a better life and even beyond death, It's significantly better for them. Did the Islamic Revolution Yes, without the Islamic Revolution, as are many others, incidentally. Personally, I enjoy spreading Suddenly, the Mullah took out his watch. It's time for prayer. Then, he continues. In Islam, it's straightforward, and on the other hand, what regulates If Islam is separated from the government, Religion also features prominently Hamshahri, the most widely This newspaper was particularly appalled of the Prophet Mohammed The daily Hamshahri, decided to retaliate regarding the Holocaust. I'm going to record this newspaper the day he organizes a press conference for the official launch The press conference is being facilitated It's this man in the white turban. Here, no stylistic devices are employed, immediately, the heavy artillery The goal of the competition If the Westerners are also fearful, it's not just because but because we are likely to uncover As a journalist, I request the freedom Did the Holocaust truly occur? And if he never existed, admit it to us, The following day, the creative director agrees to host me at his house. That's brave. Davoud Kasemi lives comfortably with his son and his wife, To stay informed, But like many Iranians, Perhaps he does not condone the regime, however, he echoes the official discourse Recently, I heard that this figure who died during the war was not accurate. It is also claimed that these individuals In fact, they were afflicted and they were dying from it. So as not to infect others with typhus or even in cases of other diseases, It was, in a manner of speaking, But as for me, you know, I can't really judge, In Iran, both cartoons and slogans with this concern to never cross the boundaries set Never critique religion or the regime. According to the most recent updates, the Holocaust Remembrance Contest. No one had sent the drawing. How can one be Jewish that advocates for the obliteration On the eve of Sabbath, I decide to visit Not many people around, a mix of young [Hebrew spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] There are still 25,000 Jews There were over 100,000 of them from the era of the Shah. Since then, and steer clear of conflicts Upon exiting, everyone quickly scatters. The fear is tangible. Iranian Jews prefer regarding the denial of the Holocaust. We are Jewish and we don't believe But he claimed Yes, these are his ideas. Do not converse with anyone here. I can talk to whoever I want. This young man isn't doing he just wants our opinion. Why are you not interested Madam, I suggest you refrain In light of their unease, You need to visit the representative for more information. Maurice Motarmed is an engineer He is also the sole Jewish representative but he too is very cautious. No, we have never been apathetic Following Mr. Ahmadinejad's address I gave an interview to the Iranian press. I have presented the historical evidence for instance, These are things His Muslim colleague Yes, I was shocked because of the actions has a background in civil engineering. He should not have broached Iran, with a population of 70 million, The economy is ailing, strictly monitored, I had barely pulled out my camera that a mere bystander stops me to verify my intentions. I am Iranian, indeed, I am Iranian. Do you know that I have a deep affection -Did you call the police? -Why the police? An Iranian is responsible, I inquired with the young lady, That's why there's no issue. I just wanted That's fine. Every one of the 60 million Iranians 60 million Iranians, they are all alike, They bear responsibility Just as two days ago, when millions of Iranians In the bazaar, we are scheduled who owns a scarf shop. A profitable business in this country But yet again, But they simply want You do not have the right But we indeed have authorization. Bring it to the police station [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] Do not worry. Why are we not allowed I don't know. [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] It was primarily the disadvantaged who propelled the new President Almost 30 million Iranians To secure his election, and rallied those who had been overlooked Lacking work, he supplied them and taglines. Not a week passes a large protest. First against the caricatures of Muhammad, [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] The Prophet Mohammed is great. The English people are bad. America also has its flaws. Israel is severely flawed and France, Allah is great! You are all liars! What you portray in your films All of you are liars! Here, people are not And she gives a thumbs up. [Arabic spoken language] In the slogans, the president [Arabic spoken language] The protest is remotely orchestrated by the government by the national media. In this strategy, and children are also highlighted. [Arabic spoken language] And the new buzzword it's the nuclear power. She has a message for you. Nuclear energy is our undeniable right and America is powerless against it. [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] Ever since President Ahmadinejad Mysticism is making a resurgence, That's why I am heading to Jamkaran, Jamkaran is a holy site. According to Shiite tradition, one of the prominent Imams, in the guise of the Messiah, the savior, Miracles are said Iranians have faith in it and they arrive Whether as a couple or a family, since it heralds the return of the Mehdi. Good evening. Why are you coming here? Here, it's a romantic rendezvous. This is the site of the Apocalypse, We pledged to come every night for 40 weeks this year. Do you admire President Ahmadinejad? Ahmadinejad is one of our own. He hails from the common folk, I have a meeting with the head once more, flanked by militiamen. Filming the prayer is prohibited, The business of selling religious images Mullahs, too, are businessmen. Imam Hamadi is the head of the Mosque. He is at the helm He is accustomed to foreign media and his discourse on the corruption and the return of the Mehdi, We are waiting for the Mehdi, We, we believe that the world today And when the Mahdi, so it will be like At that point, the world will transform, as you can observe here. But there is a hurdle, the White House, which represents the Axis of Evil The director also It is not a coincidence. The Beliefs Associated with Jamkaran are used to divert attention Furthermore, was to donate 15 million euros The following morning, of Imam Khomeini, a sacred site in Iran. 17 years after the death people come from all over the country to worship him with utmost devotion Throughout the year, tens of thousands gather around his grave. For them, it is an indication is still ongoing, remains alive. [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] In this daily procession, [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] But the highlight anniversary of Khomeini's homecoming On this occasion, but also the Basij. This is the other cornerstone Bassij signifies volunteers, It begins quite early, The Basij currently serve [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] From the perspective of the regime, the entire Iranian society Being a Bassij serving the people. I desire to serve the people. Was Ahmadinejad a good president? Yes, indeed. Ahmadinejad epitomizes the ideal Bassij. He adores the Basij. We take pride in him and towards Israel. He is a true member of the Basij. The ceremony will span the entire day. That day, the entire Iranian clergy All the Imams who have established Role models for the young Bassij. Indeed, it was the Bassij who facilitated The opposition accuses them This is indeed the stance of Dr. Yazdi, Last year, the government oil revenues to be allocated Initially, it was utilized to recruit within the most impoverished strata Just like that, they effortlessly by informing them: That of your mother, your father, your brother, so and so. And that's how they swayed the result President Ahmadinejad Since his election, They requested to interview him, That day, I attempted to approach him After an initial screening, on an official bus en route Inside, a select group of reporters, all authorized by the Presidency. Delphine Minoui is a journalist She collaborates and has been employed in Tehran We are required to follow the programs, but the foreign press does not have access This is often restricted But will we be able to ask him questions? When you are issued a press card, Can't you discuss it? Is it challenging It's not obvious. Being a journalist in Tehran The press pass needs At the finish line, it's a race to see to record the one Gradually, the theater In the front row, and professors from universities. It's the anticipation. And all of a sudden, there he is! The man who instills fear in the West, ascended to the Presidency. As always, the ceremony commences followed by the call to worship. [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] [Arabic spoken language] Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, served as the mayor of Tehran It was in this role that he captured Engineer, PhD in Civil Engineering, It stands out He promised each family from the oil industry, In his speeches, he echoes the sentiments 27 years ago: the West was perceived I would like to express it, The key to our people's survival or of wealth. The key to survival lies in culture. The West has brought nothing but war, the plight of poverty Since the Western world humanity yearns for peace. Fortunately, we see that the people and we think it's a very good path. Upon leaving, He pledged to assist the impoverished. He is bombarded and even professions of love. Mr. President, please respond, I wish to meet the President. A brief note, I love you Mr. Ahmadinejad. We'll handle it, Despite being surrounded I succeeded in asking him a question. Doctor! Doctor! A question for French television. Doctor! Doctor! A message for France? Many things. Yes, I received it, I got it. Stay strong! Peoples always attain victory. Victory always belongs to the people. [Arabic spoken language] It's impossible to acquire more. As of today, gave an interview Where does this man, who inspires and so much anxiety overseas? I decide 60 kilometers north of Tehran. Aradan, a quaint town a poor region that survives on livestock farming Here, everyone voted for him. I have a meeting with his cousins, Yes, my wife is a cousin of Ahmadinejad. He moved to Tehran at the age of seven. When he was a child, As a family, or fourth in the election Maybe they elected him Ahmadinejad is a decent man. During the initial years he had arrived from Tehran He championed the example of the Basij, The reception is warm. They are proud of the local boy We are going to visit the house Along the journey, The house is located and it has been deserted Here we are, it's here. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad lived on this farm along with his six siblings. Today, all that remains are ruins. Her parents relocated to Tehran when he was seven years old. 50 years! It was 50 years ago. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's Father is deeply religious But all of her children Did he live there? Yes, yes. In 50 years, Ahmadinejad has risen in the presidency, For us, this story is unprecedented. Generally, becoming a president networks or a specific power. He made it there with nothing. All of this is thanks to God. Simply through persistence. Qom, the sacred city, The same driver, an intelligence agent, Despite his smiles, my interpreter at my slightest movement. In this staunchly conservative city, over 80% of the votes. Yet it is in Qom with the greatest political dissident, Ayatollah Montazeri, during the initial years Today, the Imam is constantly monitored by approximately thirty Bassidj. Upon my arrival, they seized my camera that it continues to record. Half an hour later, Why did the Basij confiscate my camera? Because this area is considered In the waiting room, They are coming to seek guidance regarding religious matters Once again, Ali Montazeri, that's him, in a bonnet and slippers. He, who was once the heir apparent the intellectual powerhouse Ayatollah Montazeri, a representative close to Ayatollah Khomeini... For the interview, Ali Montazeri just as in the time of his reign. The Grand Ayatollah has not lost He is the one who authored Today, he is the only one able to critique I was one of the founding figures I desired an Islamic Republic, but not in this manner, not with oppression or the truncheon. To me, the Republic signified and being Islamic meant adhering But they introduced a term, and they turned the republic For him, the most egregious scandal, It's because the oil revenue They had everything in their favor, Back then, Today, it costs 68 dollars. But they made promises they did not keep. And as they carried out their actions they portrayed Islam in a negative light. Nowadays, young people are losing interest Returning to Tehran, I am seeking to meet with the opposition It is a significantly small opposition, impossible to locate since the representatives are seated The fight against the American devil Members of Parliament are debating imports of Coca-Cola. An opposition, discussions, the Iranian parliament Did Ahmadinejad's election shock you? I think it was a shock for everyone, both within Iran and internationally, Why? He stood no chance of success. Nobody thought he would get and that he would make it In France, you experienced this jolt and Le Pen advanced to the second round. But the French managed to mobilize to ascend to the presidency. In Iran, the same issue arose, Nevertheless, [Arabic spoken language] In the Hall of the Wandering Steps, questions for the deputies not for foreigners. Yet, I am attempting to converse a staunch conservative. Ahmadinejad ascended to power What I like is that he speaks frankly what he has to express. He voiced out loud Moreover, and that, that terrifies their leaders. Yes, I believe Do you have the permission letter The Guidance permits you but not to pose questions Opposition or not, Iran is entitled to nuclear energy. -Hello, how are you doing? We have signed why shouldn't we have access This time, we are truly being ousted Over the phone, my interpreter of the incident to his superior. We encountered issues in the Parliament. They said that we were not allowed but to simply record the session. But he still filmed it. The battle over nuclear energy as a rallying point for Iranian society. On the streets, in mosques every Iranian demands from the president to the taxi driver. One wonders why they would be entitled and not us. During the reign of the Shah, We too would like to harness If nuclear energy is so detrimental, and keep us from obtaining it? What sparked concerns in the West, It's this nuclear power plant In Bushehr, UN inspectors have uncovered was capitalizing officially but likely also as the United States In this power struggle between Tehran Ali Larijani, While I am in Tehran, It's difficult to envision that this man, is a radical Muslim, one of the most influential advisors and that he established an Islamist To take action, one must negotiate Eventually, only one question. Why is the West so apprehensive When certain heads of state, discuss about Iran, while we solely engage As is his usual practice, Ali Larijani The UN has given Iran a 30-day deadline In this nuclear negotiation, Long-range missiles, young and highly skilled troops, officially, there are 500,000 men excluding the Revolutionary Guards And in the parades, to display his kamikaze commandos. A provocation that substantiates As the ultimate threat, praises They demonstrated it 15 years ago A massacre that claimed the lives Nearly every family has experienced On Friday, the day of prayer, never empties. He was my cousin, barely 18 years old. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected Behind the propaganda what are truly the intentions How far will it go and, above all, will the Iranian people stand
