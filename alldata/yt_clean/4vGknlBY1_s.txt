RISK ASSETS ARE GOING TO BE IS IT EASY TO STAY INVESTED, INVESTMENTS? WITH THE QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW. BE ON THE HORNS OF A DILEMMA AS STILL WHO THE NEXT TREASURY &gt;&gt; AND A NEW NAME HAS ENTERED I THINK THIS IS A FASCINATING ABOUT THIS PIC FOR A COUPLE OF UP YET BUT HIS CV IS HE'S HAD EXPERIENCE ON THE HE'S WORKED UNDER GEORGE W. BILLIONAIRE HEIRESS JAY LAUDER, BEEN A BIG REPUBLICAN DONOR. NOT TO MENTION, TIME ON WALL HE HAS BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT WHICH ADDS TO THE SENSE OF KNOW WHO GETS THIS ROW, WHEN WE WON'T KNOW WHAT INFLUENCE THEY TERMS OF THAT TARIFF. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT INFLUENCE THE IT APPEARS HE'S LOOKING FOR ABOUT THE TRUMP STORY. ON BOARD WITH TAX CUTS. ON BOARD WITH THE IDEA THAT WE DEFICIT HAS FINANCED AND WHAT THE UNITED STATES. BE THE ISSUE THAT SEPARATES THE PERSON TO DELIVER. ANNA: BIG SUPPORTER OF TRUMP AND THE THAT HE'S GOT REAL RESERVATIONS &gt;&gt; THE LINE THAT HAS TO TOE IS TRYING TO AVOID A WAS TOUTED IN WALL STREET, WAS POINT, HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THE DOES HE JUST NEED A LOYALIST OR JOB? &gt;&gt; WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THERE'S ANOTHER FACTOR WHICH THE MARKET FEELS LIKE HASN'T THIS IS THE IDEA OF WHAT DEPORTATION. IMPACT ON THE U.S. THE ABILITY TO HIRE PEOPLE AND INFLATION. FOCUS A LOT ON TARIFFS RIGHT NOT THAT COMBINED WITH A STRATEGY, WHICH TRUMP, TALKING ABOUT THE IDEA THAT HE SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE BUT THE COMBINATION OF THOSE ECONOMIC EFFECT. ANNA: TALKING WITH ELSE ABOUT THE AMP LABOR MARKET. NEWS FLOW? THIS AROUND GOOGLE. FORCED TO SELL THE CHROME THIS IS SOMETHING THE DOJ IS POSSIBILITY. BE SEEN IN REAL HISTORICAL THE UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO AGO. DON'T SEE THIS AS LIKELY. HAPPEN. IF IT DID HAPPEN, REALLY CHANGES THE ARTIFICIAL EVEN IF THIS IS ABOUT ILLEGALLY SEARCH MARKET, THE SEARCH DO THE AI. &gt;&gt; IT IS, AND IT LOOKS LIKE OF ALLOWING UP DOUBTS IN THAT SIGNIFICANT. CONTINUE THIS BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT THAT WITH THIS BE A CONTINUATION OF IT BE SOMETHING PURSUED INTO HE HAS HAD CERTAIN BIG VIEWS ON &gt;&gt; I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN TARIFF POLICY BACK IN THE FIRST THE DOJ IS INTERESTING BECAUSE CHROME. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE BUSINESS THIS IS HOW GOOGLE GETS ITS IT'S ABLE TO TARGET PEOPLE. BUSINESS. UNDERMINE THE ENTIRE COMPANY? THAT'S WHY IT WOULD BE SO HUGE, THIS STARTED UNDER THE FIRST LEGAL ACTION, AND IT HAS REPEALED, WE WILL CERTAINLY BE ADMINISTRATION. &gt;&gt; ALPHABET IS A GOOD CHUNK OF I'M SURE THAT WON'T REFLECT THE GATE SHE'S LOOKING AT. &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY ARE BROKEN UP, GOOGLE, YOU NEED TO LOOK AT CONGLOMERATES, BREAKING THEM UP I DON'T THINK WE KNOW THE MAYBE THERE ARE SYNERGIES WORK AND THIS COULD BE FAIRLY A THOUSAND DAYS SINCE THE A THOUSAND DAYS THAT THE WAR DRAMATIC AFFECT NOT ONLY ON EUROPE AS WELL. GROWING SENSE THAT 2025 IS THE COMES TO A CLOSE. HAPPEN AND THAT'S THE BIT OLAF SCHOLZ MAKING CALLS TO STATES GIVEN ZELENSKY EUROPE STRUGGLING WITH WHETHER MISSILES. THE U.S. DECISION AROUND LONGER-RANGE THERE'S SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY CONCLUSION SEEMS TO BE THAT CLOSE. ANNA: EUROPE WILL HAVE TO SPEND MORE ECHOED IN THE RESEARCH WITH OVERNIGHT. HAVE TO INCREASE THEIR AND IT COULD TAKE 10 YEARS OF THOSE OPERATING THE SECTOR. &gt;&gt; IT'S FASCINATING HOW QUICKLY A NARRATIVE AROUND RUSSIA THAT UKRAINE COULD BE A POSITIVE FOR CONFLICT COULD COME TO AN END. YOU CAN SEE IT ON THE CHART IN BONDS HAVE BEEN RALLYING SINCE NARRATIVE AHEAD OF THE ELECTION. WE JUST DON'T KNOW HOW IT WILL THE ULTIMATE COST WILL BE FOR NO NEED TO REARM EUROPE AT THE BE ABSOLUTELY EPIC. WE'VE GOT PLENTY TO DISCUSS, MARKET, IT'S ONE OF THE KEY BUT WE WANT TO COME BACK TO THE THE SPACE RACE. THE U.S. I THINK DONALD TRUMP WILL THE CEO AND COFOUNDER OF THE STARTED BUILDING ALTERNATIVE THE SPACEX DRAGON WILL BE DO WE NEED TO SEE CONSOLIDATION AIRBUS HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT WILL BE JOINING US, AND THE EUROPEAN EQUITIES AT GLOBAL WE WILL TALK ABOUT AN IS THAT WHAT THEY NEED TO SORT &gt;&gt; MAY BE.

SPENDING IN ANY GAUGE ON THAT CONSUMER. OPPORTUNITY FOR NARRATIVES THAT WOULD BE REALLY THAT SIZE WEIGHING IN WITH IMPOSITION OF ANY TARIFFS ON RETAIL SALES IN THE STATES HAVE THE UPPER END CONSUMER IS STILL DOES THAT MEAN THAT THERE'S A TRADING DOWN INTO THE WALMART THIS TIME IN THE WAY WE MONTHS AGO? &gt;&gt; IF YOU LOOK AT RECESSION PRICE, THERE IS AN INVERSION POINTING OUT. CONSUMER SPENDING IS ALSO ABOUT STATION BUSINESS. ADDITION TO THE TARIFF STORY &gt;&gt; NOVO NORDISK IS LAUNCHING CHINA AS A FRACTION OF THE U.S. MARKET FOR ITS BLOCKBUSTER ELI LILLY IS ALSO GETTING DRUG. FOR WEGO LEAD TO LIMIT SUPPLY ECB'S PRESIDENT CHRISTINE THEIR MISSILES IN AREAS LIKE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH. OTHER POLICYMAKERS WHO SAY ACCELERATE A NEW ERA OF HARMFUL FOR EUROPE'S ECONOMY. ITS FORMER DEMOCRACY ADVOCATE THE LONGEST SENTENCE EVER SECURITY LAW.

IN THE EQUITIES MARKET, IT HAS WHAT COULD BREAK THE MARKET IS DEMAND DYNAMIC HEATING AND IT SUSTAINABILITY OF FISCAL IF IT STARTS EATING 5.5% OR 6%, TAKE IT WELL. ANNA: FISCAL QUESTIONS AT THE MARKET THE TERROR OF QUESTIONS BECAUSE TARIFF POLICY BECAUSE IT SEEMS MAINSTREAM THINKING AND WALL SO IT'S GOING TO BE THE FISCAL RISK FACTOR FOR MARKETS RIGHT &gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION IT WILL BE THE SEQUENCING OF ADMINISTRATION IS BASICALLY FISCAL POLICIES.

BE A PAIN THRESHOLD FOR THE INTERVENING, SO I THINK FROM THERE. POSITIONING, AND ET BUYING IN AT THE MOMENT, IF YOU LOOK AT PREMIUM ON GOLD DUE TO CENTRAL WILL REMAIN IN THE BACKGROUND AND THEN IF WE LOOK AT -- WHAT I THINK TECH IS GOING TO BE A LONG DURATION EXPOSURES.

WATER BUSINESS, WHAT DOES THAT ALSO REDUCING THEIR MEDIUM-TERM TO FUND MORE AD SPENDING AND AND PROFITABILITY TARGETS. NOVO NORDISK IN FOCUS, AS IT PRICE THAT IS LOWER THAN IN THE AND CAIXABANK IN FOCUS IN WITH THEIR RETURN ON TANGIBLE END OF 2027, NEW DIVIDEND THE HEADLINE WRITERS WILL HAVE HERE WE GO, TUESDAY MORNING, SEE MILD UPSIDE BUT A FAIRLY MORNING. STOCKS, THE FTSE 100 UP BY A MORNING, THIS BASE OF THE IDEA WITH THE DIRECTION. WE DON'T HAVE A PURPOSE AT THE TO BE COMING TO THE FORE. CONTINUES IN A MOMENT. A PANCAKE. IS DOWN, BUT ONLY JUST.

ANNA: DOING THEIR THING AMONGST ALL PERFORMING SECTOR UP 1.2%, THE THROUGH THE ASIA SESSION. CHINA STORY WHERE WE HAVE GOT OVERNIGHT FROM THE FORUM IN AROUND CHINA ON MANY FRONTS, AND STANDARD CHARTERED BEING BOOST SENTIMENT IN THE CHINESE AND IT IS ONE THAT IF THE THAT HAVE RIPPLE EFFECT BACK I WAS LINKING THE TWO VIA BASIC EXPECTATIONS AROUND THE CHINESE ALEXA RESORT, DO OTHER FACTORS GLENCORE AND RIO TINTO AND VOLUME PERFORMERS, HIGHER 1.2%. LITTLE BIT. THEY ARE BOOSTING MARKETING UP ON THAT PARTICULAR STOCK. STRATEGIST DAVID COSTON BOOSTED THE YEAR END OF 2025, CITING ECONOMIC EXPANSION AND EARNINGS ON PAR WITH MORGAN STANLEY'S INVESTORS REMAIN NIMBLE IN SELECTION. THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR. STRATEGIST AND COFOUNDER AT 6500 ON THE S&amp;P 500, DO YOU PUNCHY BUT WHAT WE ARE SAYING CURRENT TIME TO STAY IN THESE WHERE WE SEE SUPERCHARGING IF ECONOMY WITH THAT TAX CUT WE TALKED ABOUT NO LANDING, A GO AROUND. THROTTLES FORWARD HEADING BACK THAT IS THE KIND OF THING WE EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS RISING TIME, THE FED CUTTING RATES, BEFORE THE LAST 30 YEARS AND CUTS. WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE? KRITI: GROWTH AND A RESILIENT THIS NARRATIVE, WE GOT HIT BY IT WAS COMMODITY GROWTH, SUPPLY ARE TALKING AGAIN ABOUT IAN: ACTUALLY WE CAN HAVE THIS LASTING INTO THE MIDDLE OF NEXT BUT THEN, YOU START TO PAY A AND THAT PRICE IS INFLATION. IN THE BOND MARKET, THE WAY COMING BACK INTO THESE MARKETS. ABOUT BASIC RESOURCE. MORE OF THESE HEDGE WITHIN THEIR PORTFOLIOS. ARE YOU SURE THE FED WILL CUT COMPANY MORE TIMES -- IAN: THE AGENDA, GOING INTO NEXT SURE AS LONG AS INFLATION IN RELATIVELY SUBDUED, THEY WILL THEY WILL BE DETERMINED TO HAVE THE LOWEST POSSIBLE INFLATION, SEEING AT THE MOMENT. BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT YEAR DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO OWN WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET. AND BONDS OF TO CHANGE. MIGHT WANT TO OWN WILL START TO FOR NOW, I THINK YOU HAVE GOT EQUITIES. A TOUGHER TIME THE NEXT THREE ONE OF OUR KEY TRADES WOULD BE NOT CURVE STEEPENING BECAUSE THAT MORE LIMITED RESPONSE FROM THAT IS WHERE YOU NORMALLY SEE THROUGH. LOOK GOOD. ANNA: THAT LOOK GOOD INTO THE MIDDLE THE PRICE WITH A BIT OF BRINGING THINGS CLOSER TO HOME LOT PERHAPS UNEXPECTEDLY POST TRUMP, ABOUT CLOSENESS BETWEEN AND EUROPE AND THIS HAS COME THIS DESK AND IN CONVERSATIONS WONDER IF THIS IS EVER GOING TO ARE WE GOING TO SEE SOMETHING SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH THAT BECOMES THE KEY MESSAGE THAT CAME OUT LAST WEEK FROM CHANCELLOR THIS IDEA ABOUT THE NEED TO EUROPE. CANNOT RE-ACCELERATE AND GROW, THE MARKET, UNLESS IT HAS GOT THROUGH. AT THE MOMENT, IT'LL BE ALLOCATION SURVEY WHETHER MARKETS HAVE CHANGED, BUT WE RE-INCENTIVIZE INCORPORATE -- IS AT THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM BUDGET DATED, AND QUITE TELLING YOU IT DIDN'T DO IT ONE MARKET IS ASKING QUESTIONS. DISCOUNTS TO EUROPEAN STOCKS OF STATES. SACHS ON THAT FRONT. EUROPE SHOULD TRADE AT? IAN: AT THE CURRENT TIME, CLOSE TO THE EURO OF THE CURRENT TIME. BUT IT IS PERIPHERAL EUROPE THE LINK INTO THAT CHINA STORY, ABOUT, IS ACTUALLY THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK INTO TO DUMP THE BLACK ZERO AND DEBATE IS TAKING PLACE AT THE IT WILL BE INTERESTING HOW THAT POINTED OUT, THE KEY THING WE MARKETS UNION. DYNAMISM IN THE FINANCIAL TO BE LEFT BEHIND. AS WELL. GUY: IN HERE. [LAUGHTER] IAN: I HAVE STUNNED GUY.

FINANCING, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE THAT'S THE MESSAGE BRUSSELS THEY ARE AWARE THEY ARE 50 COLLABORATION. PLAYBOOK NEEDS TO CHANGE. LAST HOUR IN REGARDS TO SPACE AND THE IDEA THAT IS IT STILL A LOT OF FINANCING, OR PRIVATE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE CONCERNS, DOES EUROPE NEED TO LOOK AT PRIVATE MARKETS AS A IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER IT IS ACTUALLY WHAT IT REQUIRES IS A REGULATION, SO YOU CAN WRITE ANOTHER COUNTRY AND IT IS IN AMERICA THAT ABILITY TO GROW INSTITUTIONS, THEY NOW ACCOUNT FINANCIAL SYSTEM IF YOU EXCLUDE BANKS ONLY ACCOUNT ABOUT 25 FINANCIAL ASSETS NOW. IF YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIES TO BE THOSE WITH MORE NONBANK HIGHLY REGULATED BANK FINANCING. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS TALK A LOT ABOUT IT IN THE U.S. I HAD NOTED OUT ABOUT THE PUSHBACK IS AROUND EUROPEAN SMALLER THAN THE AMERICAN TO GET FINANCING AND LIQUIDITY TO ENGAGE THE MUCH SMALLER IT IS EVERY PART OF THE AT THE MOMENT, YOU CAN MARKET, BECOME SUCH A SMALL COMPONENT, SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE JUST SAY THAT IS TRUE AT THE RETAIL INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL. FROM INSTITUTIONAL REGULATORS INVESTORS TO INVEST IN THE U.K. INVESTORS TO DO THAT, RISK EQUITY. AND THAT IS DANGEROUS FOR PUBLIC MARKETS THAT CAN DO THIS AND GIVE YOU SIMILAR RETURNS.

JUDGE WILL NOT WORRY TOO MUCH HE'S GOING TO LOOK AT THE BEING RECOMMENDED BY THE DOJ. SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE THESE COURT RULINGS, IT IS NOT POLITICAL PRESSURE, IT IS THAT ABOUT WHICH CASES TO BRING THAT &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO THE JUDGES THEMSELVES ARE MOST POLITICAL BENT TO IT. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS MIGHT HAVE A POLITICAL SLANT TO WHEN IT COMES TO THESE ACTUAL BUSINESS MODEL OF CHROME IS 61% OF DOMAINS AROUND GETS ADVERTISING. IS THIS WHAT UNDERPINS, OR COMPANY? &gt;&gt; CHROME IS INCREDIBLY IT IS WHAT IT USES TO GET A LOT HISTORY, THAT IT THEN USES TO IT IS A VERY CRUCIAL PIECE OF GOOGLE. OTHER REMEDIES?

THE MANAGEMENT TEAM MAY HAVE TO OR IS THIS ABOUT AS MUCH AS IS BACK ON TRACK? &gt;&gt; ON THE ONE HAND, MAYBE WE IS NOT RADICAL BECAUSE THEY HAD HE HAS BEEN WITH THE COMPANY TOP MANAGEMENT. MORE, THERE ARE ANALYSTS WHO DISPOSABLES, I SPOKE TO A LOT WATER WOULD BE ON THE CHOPPING THE BUSINESS THAT WERE BUT INSTEAD THE CEO TOLD AND GRAY VEVEY THAT HE WOULD BE BUSINESSES WITHIN NESTLE, WE THINK HE HAS GOT THESE GOALS THINKS IT IS STILL MID-SINGLE MEDIUM-TERM. GUESS HE COULD SELL OTHER PEOPLE THINK THAT MID-SINGLE KRITI: DASHA JOINING US FROM A RAINY SNOWY LONDON. CONSOLIDATED TAPE. GLOBAL MARKETS IS JOINING IN ABOUT WHAT THOSE NEXT STEPS MAY THIS IS BLOOMBERG. KRITI: .&quot; AND SENTIMENT HAS HOWARD WITH 100 IS HIGHER, BUT OTHER ARE TRADING LOWER. WE SAW IN THE U.S. TRADE.

NOT EVERYONE IS CONVINCED. ONE CONTENDER TO DO THAT FOR BUSINESS IS CBOE EUROPE, IT NEW PARTNERSHIP CALLED IT ALL IS NATAN TIEFENBRUN, THE EQUITIES. IT IS A OBLIGATED ISSUE THAT IS COUNTRIES. I THINK THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE THE POINT THAT IT WAS TOO I THINK THEY ARE OVER EGGING THINK IT IS PARTICULARLY WE ALREADY CONSOLIDATE DATA EQUITY VENUES. OUR EXISTING BUSINESS, AS DO PLACE TO BE. BECAUSE FUNDAMENTALLY WE DO THERE SEEMS TO BE A QUESTION OF BECAUSE OF THIS RESISTANCE, I UPTAKE COULD COME TO FRUITION, LOOKING AT?

KRITI: THE NUTS AND BOLTS BECAUSE YOU MAKE THIS HAPPEN FOR THAT US, WE HAD A CONVERSATION LAST OPERATORS, THE CFO OF YOUR NEXT TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE CONCERNS AROUND IT. &gt;&gt; WE BELIEVE THAT A FULL SITUATION WHERE INSIDERS WILL RETAIL INVESTORS WILL GET THE WE DON'T LIKE IT. THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE IA BEST PLACE FOR RETAIL TO BENEFIT FROM THE MARKET. KRITI: THE CEO OF EURONEXT TALKING WOULD EDGE OUT THE SMALLER THAT'S WHY HE IS VOUCHING FOR A BUT NOT PRETRADE CONSOLIDATED WHAT YOU SAY TO THAT CONCERN PLAYERS? IAN: LEGISLATORS ALREADY DECIDED IT WILL BE A PRE AND POST TRADE OBLIGATE OR TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR THE TRAIN IS PULLING OUT OF THE THERE ARE TWO CONTENDERS FOR ONE OF THEM IS A CONSORTIUM OF LARGELY AS STEPHAN JUST DID, TAPE, AND FUNDAMENTALLY, THE FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF MARKET PREFER THAT INVESTORS PURCHASE BILATERALLY AND THE TABLE OFFER DATA ON A PAN-EUROPEAN CONTRACT AND PRICE.

IAN: SIMPLER THAN THE U.S., THE U.S. TAPE, ALSO HAS SOMETHING CALLED WHICH LINKS ALL THE EXCHANGES TRADE WITH ONE ANOTHER. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK, SO THE HEAVILY FOR SOME LOW LATIN SEE IT IS AN EASIER PROBLEM TO THE U.S. ANNA: IS THIS GOING TO BE SOMETHING ATTRACTING CAPITAL FOR EUROPE?
