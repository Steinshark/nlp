- Hi, it's me, Tim Dodd, Welcome to part two of my tour with the ultimate tour guide, Elon Musk. If you haven't watched Part One, you obviously need to watch that because there's just gobs of information. And in this part, we're inside the three main assembly tents, which is incredible! And just like last time, we have a map that will occasionally pop up, courtesy of Ring Watchers on Twitter, that'll help you understand where exactly we are in the factory. We also have the YouTube play bar broken up into certain sections. We have links to those And we have an article up on our website that has some key points and The link and the description at www.everydayastronaut.com. All right, let's go check So, by the way, I think that ITAR and COMS - Oh, yeah, just... It just can't be any more than people are already getting from- - Telephoto lenses. - [Tim] That, which is - And frankly, if some fool wants to copy this design, go for it. (Tim laughs) I mean, Raptor 2 is a giant - [Tim] What's the big simplifications you're hoping to have? - Well, maybe I shouldn't (Tim laughs) We have funny things on the... We've got Pikachu over there. - [Tim] (laughs) I love that. - [Elon] Hello again. - [Tim] Hello again. So that probably, I assume Is that a flown one? - I don't know if this one's been flown. - [Tim] Geez. This really does look like that thing with all the NK33s. Those videos of- Engines that came back from the cold. - [Tim] Yes, seriously. It literally looks like that. This is insane. Man, that wrap vent is big. Geez. - Yeah, I won't tell you all the secrets. (Tim laughs) You'll be able to see the - [Tim] Okay. since the engines are... It's hard to have people not see them. - [Tim] Yeah. The Raptor 2 is visibly This sort of maze of plumbing and wiring doesn't exist on Raptor 2. it's already slimmed down a ton from like- - Yeah, it used to look like - [Tim] (laughs) Yeah. - You couldn't even see the engine for all the stuff that was around it. - [Tim] No, you really couldn't. And now it's like, especially and the free burners, I mean, there's sensors every two millimeters. - [Elon] Yes. - [Tim] So, Rap-Vac or regen channel on the - [Elon] Yeah. That's a steel tube wall, - [Tim] That looks great. And it has a different profile, too, that actually looks like the initial exit. Is there a different throat Or is it? Throat's the same. - It's just the part after the throat. The diverging section Basically it's following a rail counter for a higher expansion ratio. - [Tim] Yeah, yeah. What is the expansion ratio again? Is it like 150 or something? - No. Man, I think we were... So this is actually, I think we were around 80-ish. - [Tim] Oh, okay. - But we wanna get to, we Maybe 90. - [Tim] 'Cause you're 380 ISP out of that thing, aren't you? Or I mean, sorry, yeah, 380. - 380's the aspirational number. - [Tim] Okay. - But we should be able, I or 378. And how are those coming along? It looks like obviously You've obviously made at least three. - [Elon] Yeah. - [Tim] S-20's gonna have three. - [Elon] Yes. Geez. - All the engines will have the same pumps and thrust-chamber assembly. It's really just building it one, sort of one variant that has a big nozzle and one variant that doesn't have thrust vector control actuators. - [Tim] Okay, okay. And that's gonna be the and the? I mean, it's basically the same engine, minus PVC. So, the outer shells that are 12 meters. without the stuff; - [Tim] (laughs) you're like, actually that's secretly version two. It's super simple. No. a bit like that actually. - [Elon] It's very tight. - [Tim] Really? - [Elon] Yeah. when you look at some they were also incredibly simple looking. I'm guessing they just wired to the gills with You know? They simply didn't, back in those days, they did not have good electronics. - [Tim] Right. - [Tim] There's nothing to wire up. - Yeah. How much, I feel like you and remind people that it's, failure kind of is an option. Why do you think people And why do you embrace it? How do you teach that When you're not even trying to like... You know, SN-8 is a perfect example. You weren't trying to do a mission. You're just trying to get - Yeah. We have just a fundamentally for Starship versus say, would be Dragon. Dragon, there can be no failures ever. Everything's gotta be tested six ways to Sunday. There has to be tons of margin. There can never be a failure - [Tim] Yeah. - That's extreme conservatism. Then Falcon is a little less conservative. It is possible for us to have, say, a failure of the booster on landing. That's not the end of the world. - [Tim] Right. - And then for Starship, of Dragon: we're iterating the first ever fully reusable And fully and rapidly reusable. Reusable in a way that Rapidly reusable rockets. - [Tim] It's a big deal. That's the fundamental Holy Grail for making life multi-planetary. - [Tim] where do you think in being, and definitely you've got to scratch off the list- - Yeah, definitely not rapid. - [Tim] But where do you think it failed? And where do you think... What lessons have you you're not going to be making on Starship? - The Space Shuttle had because there were people on board. So you couldn't be blowing up shuttles. So that's a big problem. - [Tim] They did very, very little. - Very little. In fact, a lack of Because a lot of the but people were too afraid to make change. - [Tim] 'Cause the design froze. - Yeah, 'cause it's like... Yeah. I mean, there was a risk/reward asymmetry. So, big punishment for, and something goes wrong, big punishment. If you make a change and it - [Tim] Yup, yup. - So, the issues with the O-ring and then with the insulation coming off they had seen this before. - [Tim] Yeah, they were known. - They were known issues. Because it had worked before, they're like, well, it worked before. Russian roulette works before. - [Tim] Right. (chuckles) Oh God. - [Elon] Look, I've pulled There must be no bullets in this gun. - [Elon] Yeah. Anyway, it's hard to iterate, though, when people are on every mission. You can't just be blowing stuff up 'cause you're gonna kill people. Starship does not have anyone on board so we can blow things up. That's really helpful. - [Tim] Do you have any considerations yet on any kind of launch escape? Are you just hoping that by you've flown it say 100, 200 times, and you're familiar with and you've mitigated it to Or what's your? Larger scale, I think is... Yeah, you basically just need to fly a lot and have a lot of redundancy. So if you lose an engine on the booster, it doesn't matter basically. If you lose multiple And you should be able to lose an engine on the ship and everything's okay. Launch escape is basically for the ascent phase. And actually most launch escape systems only protect you for a small 'Cause the typical launch escape system is a solid rocket motor which then has to be... - [Tim] It has to be jettisoned. - It has to be jettisoned So, if it's not jettisoned, the crew dies. - [Tim] That's a failure - That's a failure mode. So you have a state change Then because the damn thing's so heavy, they also can't carry So, they'll typically jettison the escape system shortly or final stage ignition. So that you don't have escape Now, at least with Dragon, we have escape all the way to orbit. So that's, I think, a safety improvement. There's no escape system That's doesn't exist. - And then, you can't on the Moon or on Mars. Yep. You can't have something pop There's no atmosphere. - And then Mars has a very So, it'll just hit the ground supersonic. Not gonna save you. So, the ship has to be safe enough for people without an escape system, because otherwise you can't go to Mars. So you might as well- to do it on Earth. Just fly it a lot. And I never really thought about that. You're gonna be flying of retribution of failure, that unlike the Shuttle, I just never really (tools whirring) - [Elon] Yeah. - [Tim] So, let's see. What? Oh, those are the vacuum - Yeah. - [Tim] Wow, that's cool! I mean, this sort of stuff, it's very much version one. - It'll be a lot better - [Tim] Well, a lot of people will ask me, hey, I want to start a YouTube video. Where do I start? And I'll be like, start, And I kind of feel like this It's like, you're not or how to make it better until you do it at least once anyway, you know? - Yes. have to start, you have to - Yeah. - [Tim] Then you improve from there. - Exactly. - [Tim] Man. Are you pretty used to the heat? I feel like it's, it's pretty hot out here. - It is hot. I mean, this is the worst. This is like summer, you know? - It's just the worst of it. - But it's not that bad. Just pretend you're in Hawaii. - [Tim] Right, there you go. So, speaking of Shuttle. - I mean, I think it's a cool view. - [Tim] Oh, it's a really cool view. And thermal protection, have made some, I mean, it looks like S-20 is gonna pretty well How are you feeling about the You feel like that's a - We'll find out. - [Tim] Has it been at least on the low altitude stuff? - Yeah. the mounting points and stuff like that. - I mean, it's still there. I mean, you can see the videos. - [Tim] Yeah. and it lands with the tiles. We have, I think, a good attach mechanism. It seems like a good attach It's just mechanically attached with some play in the tile, so the tile can move a little bit. It's quite a tricky thing with the tiles 'cause the tiles are And they're attached that is changing in It'll be a room temperature right now. Then it'll drop to cryo temperature when it's loaded with Then it will be heated So, now it'll be way Then it'll cool down. Then the tiles will themselves and they also have some expansion. There's a lot of expanding all over the place. I think one of the big questions is, are these tiles, are we gonna have a crack or a gap in the tiles? Like, if they bang into each other, they're ceramics, like So, if you bang two coffee cups together it's usually bad. - If the tiles bang each other and crack, this could result in a failure on entry. So, I think there's a when we get the ship to orbit, is it able to make it back 'Cause it's coming in like a meteor. - [Tim] Right, right. - It's like a blazing hot meteor. Will the heat shield stand up to it? Or if there's any crack - [Tim] Yeah, yeah. - So, hopefully we at least find out where the crack in the armor is. - [Tim] Right, right. - [Tim] And then if you have to, you can make some thicker or smaller, or iterate to that those failures again. - [Tim] How will you know? What if something just goes... What if the first orbital it doesn't even make it in for reentry and it's just a million pieces How will you know where it failed? - We have temperature sensors. Probably need some thermal So, just like IR cameras. if a certain section's getting real hot. - Yeah, our cameras on the inside will show you what the - [Tim] Yeah, yeah, it'll let you know if a leak propagated. if the backside temperature... Frankly, I'm not sure. In fact, I take that back. If you just have a camera-camera- - [Tim] Yeah, you'll know. - Visual, you'll see if okay, that's bad. That's the bad part, right there. So, you don't even need The steel will glow - [Tim] Right, right, right. (laughs) You'll know. It's not subtle. - [Tim] And the very first orbital test, again, it kinda seems like... There's been a lot of debate of like, is it going to orbit and deorbiting? Or is it just orbital that's inside the atmosphere? And that's how it'll deorbit? - No, it's getting to orbital velocity. But it's not circularizing it's perigee. - [Tim] Yes. - It basically goes around the Earth, but because the atmospheric drag will put it in. - [Tim] Yup, and the velocity reentry velocity will be greater that way or similar. It's not a huge difference. It could easily, if you just puff the attitude control the aldris gas alone So, raising perigee slightly is easy. - [Tim] Yeah. - It's remarkably easy. If you just wanna raise it a little bit. - [Tim] Are you hoping to - No. I mean, is it gonna try to fire its engines? for the first orbital launch, our goal is to make it to orbit without blowing up. - [Tim] Yeah. - [Tim] Yep. - And frankly, if the booster even does its job and something goes wrong with the ship, I'll still count that as good progress. - [Tim] Yeah. - Basically, actually, if it takes off without blowing up- - [Tim] (laughs) Right. stage zero, which is much harder to replace than the booster, But please do not blow up on the stand. That's my number-one concern. - [Tim] You keep calling it, you're calling the stand stage zero? - The launch system. The ground, GSE, the - Stage zero, yeah. I got so spoiled now with, It's like, there's zero for the boosters. - Really? - Okay. would call the, wait. No, sorry, opposite: the The next upper stage, or what is stage three, so it's really confusing. And I kept being like, oh yeah, third, second stage, and they're like, You know? - Well, stage zero, the launch system, the launch mount, flame diverter, sort of. - [Tim] Yep, sort of. - The big tower. The propellant farm. All the lines and everything, And it's very hard. - It's harder for us to make a stage zero than to make a booster or a ship. - [Tim] Okay. - [Tim] Hopefully it doesn't blow up. - Yes, that would be great. And then, the best-case would be that the booster does its job and also is able to relight the engines, and it's gonna splash down in the Gulf. - [Tim] Only 20 miles - Yeah, not far. - And then the ship or upper stage is gonna come in just off the coast of Hawaii, And so, we'll splash down in the Pacific. - [Tim] Yup, yup. So, again, to reiterate, on the booster, you're gonna to orient it for re-entry. You will do boost-back burn - Let's just say it's - [Tim] Yeah. - In order to be 20 miles away, we definitely would have to otherwise it's gonna be way further. - [Tim] Yeah. - So, yeah, I mean, Basically you want to not have it be too close to land, so it doesn't take out stage zero. - [Tim] Right. Yep, yep. - We want to say, basically, precisely such that if it had landed next to the tower, or if it could the arms have grabbed it? - [Tim] Yes. - Mech-zilla. - [Tim] Mech-zilla? - Mega-zilla. - [Tim] Mega-zilla? - Mecha. Yeah, like a giant mech. - [Tim] What's the plan? It just comes and sits and or that little arrester thing? - No, those little tiny arms. - [Tim] That tiny little T-Rex arm is gonna hold the whole- But those things can take a lot of load. - [Tim] And then it's a flat arm kind of like this that? - I mean, this is one of those things, it's hard to keep a secret People can just take zoomed up photos. Drive past it and take a So, it's not exactly gonna be top secret. - [Tim] Right, right. - This is the first real that's been so close to a public road, that people are literally right past the launch site. So, it's hard to keep - [Tim] That brings up, we're seeing this insane pace, we're seeing all these How much of that is normal, at Or how much of that is just because we're actually seeing it? Like, for instance, when and Falcon 9, were you doing things so crazy fast paced? Or is this also fast-paced, seeing it all so it's hard to compare? - Well, I mean, this is definitely a case where we are washing - [Tim] Yeah, yeah. - There's always dirty It's really a question of Not is there dirty laundry. Yeah. - Every program's got dirty laundry. But in this case, it's in public. But this is also a case where we're intentionally And basically, ships and amazing lawn ornaments- - Which then have to be but you know, we don't want 12 of them. It's gonna look bizarre - [Tim] Yeah. - So, since we were making a Basically every single ship and booster has had significant iterations. You either either want it to blow up or, the early ones, you want them to blow up, or you're gonna have to - [Tim] Right. to push the envelope. And frankly, if you you cannot achieve the goal of a fully and rapidly reusable rocket. - It's not possible. - You have to go close - [Tim] Right, right. - And there's a recursive factor to mass. So, if you add, say an now you also need more and you need more and you need more propellant to land it. And the structure now has more load, 'cause it's carrying that So, this applies at any given time, there's a recursive value. So, in order to achieve the Each ton is basically when it's fully considered. - So, I think we've factor, but I think it's probably so it's closer to two. - So, every one ton of - [Tim] Yeah, yep. For instance, what's S-20's dry mass? Kind of looking like, Are you like, 120 tons? Or are you? - I actually don't know We'll know it when we weigh it. - [Tim] Yeah. - There's a lot of parts (Elon laughs) - So, what is it actually? I mean, I hope it's not too insane. Ideally it's... It's dry mass is hopefully - [Tim] Really? - Yes, but then if you say dry, do you mean not counting - [Tim] (chuckles) Right, right. - Which by the way, the air, actually air mass is non-trivial. - [Tim] No, it's not. - (chuckles) 'Cause it's And then do you mean dry? Do you mean with propellant residuals? And Alvis gas, which is - [Tim] Right. - Which mass are you referring to? - [Tim] Which dry mass, right. they'll play games with the, when you say thruster so the thruster weight with or without residuals? That's a big change. - [Tim] Or with or without gimbal is something else that - Yeah. - Merlin is, I'm pretty you know, I think it's probably the best thruster weight of any engine. Because it's just so far, we really pushed the GG It's like A-plus for But GG cycle architecture is - [Tim] Architecture, right. - Full flow stage combustion, But with the new architecture, we won't get it an A-plus within that. It's like in gymnastics, you know, you'd like to say, how And then what grade do - [Tim] In the program, yeah. - That's kind of how things work here. - [Tim] What would you say If you were to rate 'em? I'd say it's like, B-plus. - Something like that. So, good enough for now. But of course, reiterate. Raptor 3, Raptor 4, Raptor 5. By Raptor 5, it'll be an A-plus. - [Tim] Yeah, yeah. Should we walk through here and check out what's going on in here? This is just a nose cone being assembled. It's not that it's showing? - [Elon] This is our new - [Tim] Oh yeah, it's just straight. There's no cross section. - If you look at that that's made from stamped sections. You can see that's three This will be made of two - [Tim] Wow. - [Elon] And you can see - [Tim] Yeah. - This is stretched So just take a big sheet of steel. And if you just stretch - [Tim] Right, right, right. - And then you can have Like you can't fit this This is way too big. That's like basically about as long as you can fit in a stamping press. You cannot fit something this giant. Well, you can technically stamping machine that doesn't exist. But since you only need a single sided, it doesn't have indentations or anything. You couldn't make a But you can make something that is, basically you So you can just stretch - [Tim] And this isn't the cargo. It's not complete yet, but it had that opening on the one side. That's not because you The jaws yet, right? - Yeah, I actually the faring door. - We're gonna focus on getting to orbit. We don't need a door. It's like, we need to be super then super focused on then we can worry about doors. - [Tim] Okay. - It's just an unnecessary complexity. Is the door necessary No. Will we use this, the first 10 or more that get back from orbit, we probably won't fly them again. Or maybe once or twice, but For Falcon 9, and even the Block 5, So for Block 5, which is But we don't even want to Even those were a pain in the ass. And we prefer to retire them. So when we have a mission that requires an expandable booster, because the early Block 5s are not as good as the later Block 5s. And they're more of a pain in the ass to get ready for flight. - [Tim] Wow. - Reality is, the early ones are gonna I mean, as good as a lawn ornament gets. But they will not be nearly as good as the ones that follow. So then why keep them flying? - [Tim] They're not gonna You don't even need to worry about it yet. retire the early ones anyway. Why have a door on a thing that's never gonna fly satellites anyway. - [Tim] How is the butt 'Cause that's gotta be a 'Cause you're probably gonna - No. - No, we're gonna get - [Tim] Okay. - We don't need orbital refueling. Unless you're going to the Moon, you need orbital refueling. Going to Mars, you need orbital refueling. Delivering satellites to Earth orbit, you do not need orbital refueling. - [Tim] Right, right. - So just punt that 'til later. - [Tim] Okay. - I'm not sure it'll be the butt to butt. It might be something different. We switched the propellant full drain lines to be side. So, coming from the side. - [Tim] Not up through - No. It was adding a bunch And then we're flying it every time. If you can move mass to the ground side, it's better to move - [Tim] Right, right. - That's why we took and just have the tower catch it. - [Tim] Are you thinking - Which sounds mad. - I know it sounds insane. But when I suggested that, Which I'm like, maybe I have. But I think it might take but we'll get it right. It's just, the work that you have to do to pick up the booster and this gigantic skyscraper windy situations; it's - [Tim] Yeah it is. - So, you're gonna pick up this booster, you're gonna put it onto Then you've gotta pick a ship up and put it up on top of that. That means you've got to steady the booster so all over the place. And then while the sort of mech is armed, pick up the ship and - [Tim] Okay. The mech-zilla arms are picking up the ship, not the crane? - Okay, so... (Elon chuckles) Very important to appreciate is a work in progress. - And what is said last week - [Tim] We've seen that a few times. - Yes, it could be that we're actually just literally mistaken, Any one of a number of things. We just found a better, had a better idea. In the case of like we're we're gonna do that with a crane. - [Tim] Yeah. - Yeah. Marvin the Martian right there. - [Tim] I love that. - The first one we're 'Cause otherwise we'd have to wait for all the mechanisms to work. We're assembling the arms and basically putting mech-zilla together. But in the meantime we could be launching. So let's not wait for the We've got the second-biggest We don't necessarily want to on Earth just sitting there forever. But it can be there And then from the first you know, just like, do we have the hull downs work? Or the launch mounts, I should say. It's really quite a It's got basically 20 mount points. And you've got to line those things up and then put the booster on it and have the, you know, does it fit? Okay, it won't fit, basically. Now we gotta adjust it. That launch ring is 370 tons. - [Tim] Oh my God! - And it's gonna tweak, you move it from one place It doesn't stay exactly the same. So we're gonna have to like put in some shims and stuff and fit the booster. So, we wanna do that soon. We should be done with this booster, I don't know, next week. - [Tim] Yep. Wow. - [Elon] So then we want to - [Tim] That's gonna be insane to see. - Yeah. We're gonna try to put the ring on the stand, the launch ring - [Tim] Wow. - But we may not succeed, we'll see. Probably the second flight we'll use, I mean, it's probably like the second - [Tim] Okay. Second flight, oh, so the first flight might still just use the suborbital pad? - No, it's gonna use the, it has to use the orbital pad. The suborbital pad cannot take It's gonna get crushed and it So the rocket would It's too low and too weak. We gotta launch it from But we don't want to wait with the tower, just to stack. - [Tim] Okay, so, how when it's stacked? Just drop the Starship on top? - [Tim] Until it's launch time and then? - We do need the QD arm to work. - [Tim] Oh right. So that can be a stability thing. - Exactly, it holds it, it stabilizes it, and transports propellant. If we don't have that, on the ship. So that has to be complete, but not necessarily the going on at that point. - [Tim] Dang. - [Elon] Yeah, exactly. - I mean, like I said, there's a lot of moving pieces here. So some of this could be ready in time. It's possible that the tower in which case we'll use the tower. But if the tower's not ready - [Tim] Okay. - [Tim] So at this point in development, what things are you being Like, what's the thing you're like, oh, we just need to do Or we really, I can't we haven't figured this out yet. - I'm sorry? - [Tim] Yeah, so, what things are just totally keeping you What's the thing that you feel like you still have to solve at this point? - I mean, there's a long list. - [Tim] What's at the For you at least personally. - This is really all just measured as, in terms of time, like, what is the time risk The one thing you cannot replace is time. And I do have a habit of being I mean, if I wasn't optimistic, I wouldn't be doing the - [Tim] Right. I don't know just pathologically (Tim laughs) - [Tim] Wow, that actually, - [Elon] Yeah, it looks - [Tim] That is incredible. - [Elon] Doesn't that look cool? - [Tim] It's actually coming - [Elon] It totally I think. - [Elon] Yeah. - [Tim] And it's so looking than I thought. There's a few broken tiles, but overall it looks cool. - [Tim] That's incredible, wow. So, I guess, the joints that the community has I guess the good thing is the flaps, will for mostly take most of the wind from this area that you see. So, I guess you don't really have to cool the inside of the flap joint itself 'cause it's kind of already- - No, actually, unfortunately we do. I think we have significant... Take a lot of what I'm I often am wrong. Sometimes I'll say (Tim laughs) I think we have a design error with the, with the non-moving portion - [Tim] Okay. - Because the reason we have... The flaps and the static arrow, basically the unmoving are there to do two things: to balance, rebalance the ship so it doesn't come in engines first. Otherwise, the center - [Tim] Yeah. - And it will come in engines first and burn up the engines. - [Tim] Yep. - So, first you have in a hypersonic stream, sort of like, a 60 to Because you're flying a - [Tim] Peak heat. But you don't care about total heat load. You just care about - [Tim] Because you have And you're not ablating. So, if you have an ablative Technically Dragon is 'cause it's sort of like a brake pad. You can fly it many times 'cause it's got so much margin. But PICA literally means phenolic impregnated carbon ablator. - [Tim] Yep. - That's the Dragon heat shield. So, Dragon was like, hey, let's have a, give me high-peak heating, but don't make my total heat load high because what Dragon is trying to optimize for is what is the heat pulse The heat pulse moves through the tile and then reaches the to the carbon fiber - [Tim] Yep. - If the heat is too high, and the heat shield tiles And then they will potentially, you know, damage the parachute. - [Tim] Really? Okay. these things like- - Potentially, 'cause they're low density. So they they're pretty... Intermittently it's kind of a corner case. The graying heat shield not because of how much of the heat shield will be ablated, but that will reach the that might melt the glue - [Tim] Wow. Yeah, interesting constraint - Yeah, so if you just have that's actually better for Dragon. High peak, low total heating. So its reentry profile is - Yeah. as opposed to this- Dragon wants to come in real steep. The lift over drag A lot of people look at it and but it does. If you have a gumdrop-shaped thing, and you have off-centered center of mass, then you can control it because because the gumdrop is tilting It's quite low. And actually, L over D is People always go, well, But like, okay, what mach is that? And it's usually some sort But your L over D is It's garbage, nothing basically. So it's like, L over Anyway, it's got a very low L over D. But it does have a lift vector. And then because it is symmetric, or more or less symmetric, you can rotate the and change that lift vector. You have a landing ellipsoid because your accuracy longitudinally is less than your accuracy left to right. So, you're changing lift how do you change the If you can turn left or right but how do you change lift point? You do a series of S turns. So, you S turn and depending during the S turns, that and then your lateral point because you have a lift - [Tim] 'Cause it's not so much, people might think, oh, That really doesn't of orbital velocities and everything. It's really about your actual velocity. And where you end up is where you're gonna pretty much, more or less. I think it's just very to appreciate that there's between orbit and space. - It is actually relatively But it is very hard to get to orbit. - [Tim] Right. - And then you say you want This is easily 100 times maybe 1000; so much harder. That hardly anyone's even, you know, only a few countries - [Tim] Right. - You know, whereas Burt What was it, like, 12 years ago? I don't know, it was a while. What, 15 years ago? - Yeah, it was like 15 years ago. He went to the border of space twice, and didn't even scorch the paint. It's really not very hot if - [Tim] Right, that's true. - [Tim] That's true. (machine beeping) - Whereas, this needs really or it's gonna get to, you know, blow up basically. - [Tim] Yeah, yeah. It's crazy to see now, honestly. So, is there some considerations Can we go out this way or is it? - Yeah, I mean, just don't let - [Tim] All right, deal. So there's another barrel section of S-20. - I mean, it looks a little garage shop, to be frank. But it's like weirdly with garage shop. - [Tim] Well, it is to basically build the rockets first and then start building You know? The production system is - [Tim] Right. - The rocket design is relatively easy And these tiles are at a SpaceX factory we call the Bakery. In Florida, it's next to a Ron Jon's. (Tim laughs) - [Tim] What's the future Are you gonna get it flying 100%, get it all figured out basically? At least get orbital version ready and then start setting up shop in Florida? - Yeah, I think we wanna kind of iron out the major issues here. We'll certainly be launching We might do more at the Cape. But we'll certainly be launching And like I said, we make which is actually quite a big factory to make these heat shield - [Tim] Next to Ron Jon's? - Well, technically it's next to a Ron Jon's distribution warehouse. Literally, I was like, Yeah, well, maybe it's but I just got a Ron Jon's logo. But the factory, the SpaceX heat shield It's not tiny. 'Cause you need to make - [Tim] And for the most part, It looks like they're which obviously is a huge improvement compared to the Shuttle. Instead of having 24,000 unique tiles. - [Elon] (laughs) Yeah. And you can see we're figuring it out. - [Tim] But I'm surprised, though, even as the area tapers, it's not, I would have thought- - Mara's head of heat shield engineering. It's like, I'm gonna text him - [Tim] It doesn't seem like They mostly look uniform, - [Elon] Yeah, they're not all uniform. - [Tim] A lot more than the Shuttle. What's your expected, what are you hoping to get - Oh, I mean, no meaningful limit. As many as you want. (machines beeping) - [Tim] There we go. We got right back into camera-ception for you there for a second. Camera inside of camera. (machines beeping) - Yeah. There are different shapes of tiles. You can see some of are square instead of hexagons. - [Tim] Yep. - And then, because the static arrow is, it's still seeing actually a lot of heat, basically the plasma and then it's moving around. It's got to somehow get past it. You've got super heated then riding up the side of the vehicle, hitting that static arrow. So, you actually have a And then you've got a hinge that's, you have to protect the hinge. This is if you said like, okay, what's highest probability of failure on reetry? It's probably the hinge of the flaps. So, the rear hinge and the 'Cause you have to have a rotating thing, but you can't just make So, you have to have a seal. So we have to seal against, against the tiles. So, the tiles are ceramic, like that are super hot. So you can't use rubber. - So it's gotta be a metal seal, and with a torturous path. - [Tim] Have you thought about, back in the day, you talked - Yes, so, that's one of the is transpiration cool the joint. - [Tim] That would be so cool. I just want to see it - It'll definitely help. - [Tim] 'Cause you can with a higher-pressure gas. As long as it's higher or the plasma stream, it will create a thermal barrier. - It's definitely one of the things, if you really want to nail is bleed fuel gas into the thing. 'Cause actually, even the burning methane is like, with air, because air is only like, 21% oxygen. If you ask me, what are you breathing, they think they're breathing oxygen. You're breathing nitrogen - [Tim] A little argon. - And some argon and some trace gases. But essentially, methane with air, which is mostly not oxygen, So even if it burns, it's - [Tim] Right, right, 'cause the vehicle at that point. as the plasma that's hitting it. - [Tim] Right. - Yeah. - All right, well, let's see. I guess the car is? (woman speaks off mic) (machines beeping) - [Tim] So, each tent's One's barrel section, one's one's just kind of the thrust pucks and stuff? - Yeah, like I said, it is a constantly evolving thing. We've changed what occurs and in the high bay and But this certainly currently - [Tim] You're working on - Yeah, we're building a higher high bay. - [Tim] Uber high? - It's only a little bit but it's much wider, and that run full width and depth. - I mean, it will feel compared to our current high bay. - [Tim] Like how about tall, do you know? - Sorry? - [Tim] About how tall? - I dunno, probably, oh, like 100 meters. - [Tim] Okay, and this one's? Like 80 or something. This one's about 80. The booster height's about 70. Although it's kind of funny. Like technically we deleted from the booster, so it's (Tim laughs) - [Tim] You did that on purpose. - No, it wasn't even me. I was like, the guy's like, hey, just let me know, at 70 which is a pain in the ass. So, they just deleted it, and I was like, cool, sounds good. I mean, I randomly set It's not like any special about it. - [Tim] Right. - I guess fate loves, I don't know. I don't know what's going on. But these certain numbers all the time. - So the booster is And then it's Booster 4 and Ship 20. - [Tim] 20. (laughs) - And this is all happenstance. - [Tim] Right, right. I love that. (Tim laughs) - [Tim] Oh yeah, someone oh, what was it? Oh, I don't even remember but it was something like you were 69,420 days old or minutes old or something when you went on SNL or something. - What? ridiculous. - [Tim] Yes, it was the weirdest- - You know I was born 69 - [Tim] Oh yeah. (laughs) Come on! - [Tim] This is ridiculous. - [Tim] That's so funny. - I mean, what the hell? - [Tim] Oh man. This is insane. - It's like, am I an avatar - [Tim] Yes. - Oh really? - [Tim] Statistically, yeah. - Okay. - [Tim] You're probably doing pretty good at the game, though. I bet you're like, the top ranked player. - Okay. Well, that's something. - [Tim] Do you have a name - [Elon] No, I guess we've We still haven't really because it wasn't really a critical path. So it's kind of just sat there. And the elevator, we 'cause we have this construction elevator. - [Tim] Right. - We don't yet have a name. Nor have we used it. But we're making good progress there installing the grid fin. - [Tim] Yeah, looks And I like how they're now... Let me try and guess closer together and not Is it because you can to change whatever axis If you're trying to pitch the vehicle, you're really only most of the time probably either doing pitch or yaw. You're likely not doing pitch and yaw when it's coming in for reentry. - Well, actually no. We're controlling on Now, technically you only need three fins to control on three axes. - [Tim] But you can also roll and roll 90 degrees, it would be pitch. - Well, the control authority you need is much more in pitch than Like, the amount of control is practically nothing. - But for pitch, you've got to basically push the booster down. So, you got to push this monster thing into the wind and it The amount of pitch force you need, that's where you need So, having the two pairs like more like an X-wing fighter allows them to contribute more in pitch. - [Tim] Which then allows more glide or more of the air frame hitting - You care about how relative to how much force So you need a lot of so that's where you want - [Tim] Yep, yep. - You could arguably say they should be biased even closer together - [Tim] Yeah. - But this is a reasonable guess. - [Tim] In between. - [Tim] So, this might more than the Falcon 9. 'Cause the Falcon 9 pitches pretty hard, but it's skinnier and of course with the 90 degree thing. So maybe this could pitch even more and arrest more of its velocity by gliding. you've got various things that are better, some things that are better, You can leave it like an airplane, like an empennage where a rudder and an elevator. And if your elevator is far then the amount of force you need is less to change the angle. Just think of it like a see-saw. You got a see-saw or a wrench. And if you have a long wrench, it's easier to turn than a short wrench. If you have a shorter booster, a short booster is harder to Depending on where the control surface is relative to your center of mass. The center mass is kind like it's seesawing and center of pressure. You have two things basically. It's like basically, it sounds But basically it's a where there's a center of And it's gonna basically - [Tim] Yep, yep. - So, if you've got a long stage that where the grid fins are far away from your center of mass, then you - [Tim] To turn it, yep. - Basically. That makes sense. - Yeah, like a really short stubby thing, it would actually be - [Tim] To move it. But at least as far as the fineness ratio, this has a lot more to actually use atmospheric, to use the atmosphere to slow down before it even has to light its engines. 'Cause you know how like New Glen has those straights on the side. And it looks like they're really planning to almost fly the thing for a little bit at a pretty high angle of attack compared to the relative wind stream, to really let the atmosphere as much as possible. You guys have a pretty, there's a lot less fine ratio. It seems like you get a lot - Realistically, this is gonna come in at something close to terminal velocity. - [Tim] Right, oh yeah. - 'Cause you're trying to So, it's very difficult to and also get caught by the tower. - [Tim] Right. landing area, then you If you want a precise landing, you can't do a sudden pitch up at the end. And then you've got pretty big moments of inertia here. Big things don't move like small things. - [Tim] Right. - You don't see a super tanker dashing around like a speed boat. - [Tim] Right, right, right. in rocket form of a super tanker. It doesn't move fast. It's like (vocalizes). - Like way bigger than a whale. - [Tim] Yeah, yes it is. - It's just not gonna move fast. - [Tim] Right. - Although, ironically, - [Tim] Yeah. - Big rotating things always move slower than small rotating things. - [Tim] Yeah. - [Tim] Yeah. - Yeah. - [Tim] Should we head to the pad? - Yeah, there's a lot of I mean. Yeah. - Man, oh man, wasn't that Now, in part three, down to the launch pad, and just walking around at work. It's super fascinating. Again, thank you, Elon, hanging out with me.
