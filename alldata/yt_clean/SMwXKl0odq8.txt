Two, he didn't play And three, they genuinely certainly to the Republican and if he got that far, &gt;&gt; Guys, we have a con artist in the Republican Party. A guy who has made a career out &gt;&gt; He was a shock to the and they did everything they to prevent him. &gt;&gt; Donald Trump is a phony, His promises are as worthless as a degree from He's playing the members of the &gt;&gt; Every time the establishment it played into the narrative to put out there, which was that they were going to do anything that they could to take &gt;&gt; This man is a pathological He lies practically every word &gt;&gt; Tonight, in Greenville, South Carolina... &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: On the debate &gt;&gt; You are the single you probably are worse You are the single biggest liar. &gt;&gt; One by one, each rival comes He throws them away. &gt;&gt; This guy lies.

How do you survive As a Republican, how do you you're allowed to grab women because you're a star?

Nobody had it beforehand. &gt;&gt; The genius part of Donald these women were coming. He just had them &quot;The media's welcome to come in And the media was stunned. Because the media couldn't doing something like this. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Standing the man who had orchestrated &gt;&gt; Mr. Trump may have said some but Bill Clinton raped me and I don't think there's &gt;&gt; It was to show America that about the Clintons that many And that he was going against the Clintons in a way that was so tough that it gave some satisfaction &gt;&gt; Okay.
