LOOK AT THIS, IT'S REALLY BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE THE FIRST &quot;FROZEN.&quot; I FEEL LIKE MY KIDS WERE JUST BORN. ACTUALLY OLDER THAN MY DAUGHTER. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: DID YOU KNOW THEY MADE FIVE FAST AND FURIOUS MOVIES SINCE THE LAST &quot;FROZEN&quot; MOVIE? &gt;&gt; HOW OLD ARE THEY NOW? &gt;&gt; Jimmy: MY DAUGHTER'S FIVE AND A HALF. &gt;&gt; IT'S BEEN SIX YEARS. BUT IT'S ALSO BEEN SORT OF SIX YEARS IN THE MAKING. AND THIS MOVIE IS, IT HAS MATURED WITH ITS AUDIENCE, THAT'S WHAT I'LL SAY. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: IS THAT THE IDEA WITH THE MOVIE? IS THAT YOU WANT THOSE SAME KIDS WHO WERE LITTLE WHEN IT CAME OUT, NOW IT'S TAILORED TOWARDS THEM? OR IS IT TAILORED TOWARD -- &gt;&gt; IT'S THE SAME PHILOSOPHY AS THE FAST AND FURIOUS FRANCHISE. YOU WANT TO GROW WITH VIN DIESEL'S CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; I SEE. THAT MAKES SENSE. &gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE WE'RE INSIDE THE ACTOR'S STUDIO, JUST WATCHING THIS GREAT INTERVIEW. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: LIKE YOU GOT REALLY GOOD SEATS. YOU LOOK LIKE AUCTION WINNERS RIGHT NOW. THE MOVIE BY THE WAY, I'M SURE YOU KNOW THIS, BUT THE MOVIE SET A RECORD FOR TICKET, ADVANCED TICKET SALES, SO PEOPLE ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY EXCITED TO GO SEE IT. &gt;&gt; HEY, SIRI, HOW MUCH DO I SEE OF THAT? &gt;&gt; Jimmy: THAT'S NOT AN APPLE WATCH. &gt;&gt; THAT DOESN'T WORK. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: IT DOESN'T WORK ON EVERY WATCH. BUT THAT'S, SO YOU, THE PREMIERE IS ACROSS THE STREET TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: DO YOU HAVE BIG GROUPS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE JUMPED ON BOARD? KRISTEN, ARE YOU BRINGING YOUR DAUGHTERS? &gt;&gt; NO, I'M NOT. THEY DON'T DO WELL IN SITUATIONS WHERE I CAN'T PAY ATTENTION TO THEM. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: THEY DEMAND YOUR FULL ATTENTION? &gt;&gt; CORRECT. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: I SEE. &gt;&gt; I'M BRINGING A WINNER, I HAD A RAFFLE FOR THE WOMEN'S PEACE AND HUMANITARIAN FUND, I WILL NOT MAKE THEM SIT IN THE BACK. THEY ARE RIGHT HERE! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] &gt;&gt; Jimmy: IDDINA, HOW ABOUT YOU? &gt;&gt; I'M BRINGING MY SON WHO'S 10 YEARS OLD, AND HE'S BRINGING HIS GOOD FRIEND. AND THEY LOVE BASKETBALL AND NOT SO MUCH INTO DISNEY PRINCESSES. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: OH, THEY'RE NOT. &gt;&gt; SO I MADE SURE HE HAD A FRIEND IN CASE THEY WERE SUPER BORED. AND I JUST WANTED HIM TO SEE THAT MOMMY'S COOL, JUST FOR ONCE. I'M HOPING ONE DAY HE HEARS THE MUSIC AND DOESN'T TELL ME TO SHUT UP. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S HARD TO HEAR YOUR MOTHER SING. THERE'S SOMETHING IN OUR DNA AS HUMAN BEINGS THAT WE REJECT IT. DOES YOUR SON, DOES HE NOT THINK YOU'RE COOL AT ALL? &gt;&gt; HE WAS IN A MUSIC CLASS, AND THE TEACHER ASKED EVERYONE WHO THEIR FAVORITE SINGER WAS, AND HE RAISED HIS HAND AND SAID HIS MOM, HE DIDN'T TELL ME THAT, HIS TEACHER DID. WHEN I'M PRACTICING THE SONGS, THEY'RE REALLY HIGH AND ANNOYING. &gt;&gt; MY MOM! &gt;&gt; I DON'T GET IT. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOUR MOM. &gt;&gt; BUT HE IS YOUNG. HEY, SIRI, DID THAT JOKE WORK? &gt;&gt; HE'S HAD, LITTLE KIDS SAY MY MOM SINGS &quot;LET IT GO&quot;, AND THEY SAY SO DO I. AND HE SAYS, NO, MY MOM REALLY SINGS &quot;LET IT GO&quot;, AND NOBODY BELIEVES HIM. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: MAYBE THEY SHOULD. YOU CAN CARRY THIS CLIP AROUND AND PEOPLE WILL KNOW. WHAT ABOUT YOU, JONATHAN, DO YOU HAVE AN ENTOURAGE? &gt;&gt; I HAVE A HUGE ENTOURAGE. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: WHO'S IN YOUR ENTOURAGE? &gt;&gt; FROM LANCASTER, PENNSYLVANIA. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: THAT'S AMISH COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; EXACTLY. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: SO THEY'VE NEVER SEEN LIKE MOVING VEHICLES. &gt;&gt; IT TOOK THEM WEEKS TO GET HERE ON THE AMISH BUG EYGY. THEY MADE IT JUST IN TIME. IT'S MY BOYFRIEND, MY MOM, MY BROTHER, HIS WIFE AND MY 2-YEAR-OLD AND 4-YEAR-OLD NIECES. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: OH, BOY, YOU'VE GOT TO BE NUMBER ONE UNCLE. AND JOSH, YOUR CHILDREN? &gt;&gt; NO, I'M BRING AGO COUPLE FRIENDS, TYRESE, THE ROCK. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YEAH, I THINK, AGAIN, YOU HAVE THE WRONG MOVIE. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I HAVE MY KIDS ARE COMING. MY PARENTS ARE COMING. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: OKAY. &gt;&gt; IT'S BASICALLY JUST THE SAME AS JONATHAN. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: SO THERE WILL BE A LOT OF JEWS AT THE THING TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: THAT'S GOOD NEWS. HAVE YOU TOLD YOUR KIDS, ANY OF YOU, WHAT HAPPENS? BECAUSE IT'S A SECRET. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: AND STERLING K. BROWN WAS HERE THE OTHER NIGHT, AND WOULDN'T EVEN TELL ME IF HE SINGS. &gt;&gt; I TELL MY KIDS ALL OF IT. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOU DID? &gt;&gt; YOU SO BADLY WANT YOUR KIDS TO THINK YOU'RE COOL. AND I SAY THAT TO THEM ALL THE TIME. I'M LIKE, YOU DON'T GET IT, I'M LITERALLY A COOL MOM. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW COOL I AM A, AND THEY WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. SO WHEN WE FIRST READ THE SCRIPT LIKE TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO, THREE YEARS AGO, I CAME HOME, AND I WAS LIKE, OKAY, HERE'S THOUSAHOW IT GOES DOWN. AND I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING, AND I SAID JUST KEEP IT A SECRET, AND THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME, KIDS ARE BAD SECRET KEEPERS AND I'M GOING TO BREACH MY CONTRACT. I'VE GOT TWO MORE WEEKS. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE. I'VE MET YOUR DAUGHTERS, AND THEY'RE VERY TALKATIVE. AND I COULD EASILY, I COULD SEE THEM, I COULD SEE THEM TELLING EVERY, TELLING ALL. &gt;&gt; I BLEW IT, I WANTED AN EGO BOOST. I WANTED THEM TO BE LIKE, WOW! THAT HAPPENS? AND I BLEW IT. &gt;&gt; THE DAUGHTERS TOLD ME THE ENTIRE PLOT LINE OF THE USUAL SUSPECTS. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: DID YOU TELL YOUR KIDS? &gt;&gt; I SHOWED MY KIDS THE MOVIE. AND THEN I SARLTARTED FREAKING , BECAUSE I WAS LIKE, OH, I THINK I SIGNED SOME DISNEY AGREEMENTS. AND AFTERWARDS, I WOULD LIKE PUT THEM TO BED AT NIGHT AND BE LIKE, REMEMBER, WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT, AND THEY'RE LIKE, WE KNOW. BECAUSE I'M LIKE, YOU KNOW, DADDY WANTS YOU GUYS TO KEEP HAVING DINNER. BE ABLE TO SLEEP WITH A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD. CA DADDY LOVES YOU. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: THAT'S YOUR VERSION OF A NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT. YOUR DAUGHTERS, JUST BLAME IT ON THE GADGETS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NOW. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: THEY'RE THE ONES WHO BLAB. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SURPRISED THAT WHILE WE'RE SPEAKING ABOUT SECRETS BY THIS STORY THAT WE FOUND, FROZEN TWO, ELSA, ACTUALLY KRISTOFF'S SISTER IN FAMILY SECRET SHOCK. &gt;&gt; WOULDN'T THAT MEAN ANNA IS ALSO KRISTOFF'S SISTER? &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YES, IT WOULD. IT'S LIKE &quot;GAME OF THRONES.&quot; &gt;&gt; WHO WROTE THIS! MY KIDS WROTE THIS! &gt;&gt; Jimmy: THE CAST OF &quot;FROZEN&quot; IS HERE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A CLIP FROM THE MOVIE. &gt;&gt;&gt; EHHHHH &gt;&gt; LION, GRIZZLY BEAR! &gt;&gt; ANGRY FACE! &gt;&gt; UNREDEEMABLE MONSTER. &gt;&gt; GREATEST MISTAKE OF YOUR LIFE! &gt;&gt; WE DIDN'T EVEN KISS YOU. &gt;&gt; VILLAIN! &gt;&gt; WE ALL KIND OF GOT IT. &gt;&gt; OKAY, OLAF, YOU'RE UP. &gt;&gt; OKAY. SO MUCH EASIER NOW THAT I CAN READ. LIGHTNING ROUND, BOYS AGAINST GIRLS. &gt;&gt; OKAY, I'M READY, I'M READY. GO. &gt;&gt; UNI CORN. ICE CREAM, CASTLE, TEAPOT, MOUSE. OOH, ELSA! &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK OLAF SHOULD GET TO REARRANGE. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: THAT'S &quot;FROZENII.&quot; OPENS NOVEMBER 22nd. JONATHAN, YOU HAVE A SONG IN THIS ONE. &gt;&gt; I DO HAVE A SONG IN THIS ONE. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: IT'S OKAY TO SAY THAT? &gt;&gt; FINALLY! &gt;&gt; IT'S OKAY. THEY WROTE THIS AMAZING '80s JAM. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: I HEARD YOUR MOTHER IS LIKE A HUGE FAN OF &quot;FROZEN&quot; IN THE FIRST PLACE. &gt;&gt; SHE IS. SHE'S GOT DUCT TAPE WITH MY CHARACTER ON IT IT HAN THE KBRA. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DUCT TAPE? &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE GOT THE KRISTOFF DUCT TAPE, BUT IT EXISTS. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: IS THAT YOUR FAVORITE PIECE? &gt;&gt; HANDS DOWN. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: IS THERE ANYTHING THAT'S CAUGHT YOUR EYE THAT YOU ARE LIKE OH, THAT'S UNUSUAL. &gt;&gt; THERE'S AN OLAF POTTY-TRAINING TOILET SEAT. &gt;&gt; WHAT? &gt;&gt; THAT'S PRETTY UNUSUAL. NOT QUITE AS UNUSUAL AS DUCT TAPE. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: UTILITARIAN. KIDS LOVE DUCT TAPE. YOU KNOW. THE LITTLE GIRLS ESPECIALLY. &gt;&gt; I HAVE SANDWICH BAGS, BUT I CAN'T REALLY USE THEM, BECAUSE MY SON WOULD BE EMBARRASSED. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YEAH. KRISTEN, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING? &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING. BUT IT'S RARELY MY KIDS. THEY HAVE THE DOLLS, BUT ALL THE KIDS AT SCHOOL HAVE ALL THE FROZEN STUFF. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE HOW MANY THINGS HAVE FROZEN ON IT, YEAH FROM SANDWICH BAGS TO DUCT TAPE, I GUESS. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: AND THE POTTY FOR INSTANCE, THE OLAF POTTY, DOES OLAF SAY ANYTHING THAT REFERENCES? &gt;&gt; I HAVEN'T USED IT IN A COUPLE OF YEARS, BUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] &gt;&gt; I IMAGINE YOU SIT ON IT AND HE'S LIKE, &quot;I LIKE WARM STUFF.&quot; &gt;&gt; GOD. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE VOICE FOR OLAF? WAS THAT BASED ON A SNOWMAN YOU KNOW? OR? &gt;&gt; QUITE A FEW, ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW, IT WAS TRIAL AND ERROR. WENT IN, YOU KNOW, TRIED SOME LOW VOICES. TURNS OUT, I AM OLAF DOESN'T QUITE WORK. DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME RING TO IT. WE ORIGINALLY, WHEN I FIRST STARTED RECORDING, HE HAD A LIIS P. AND WE REALIZED IT DOESN'T QUITE WORK FOR A CHARACTER WHO SINGS A SONG CALLED &quot;IN SUMMER&quot;. SO WE KILLED THAT. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: IT'S LIMITING. NOW BOTH OF YOU ARE GETTING STARS ON THE HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME. &gt;&gt; WOO! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] &gt;&gt; Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS. IDINA, IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOUR 10 YEAR OLD WILL RESPOND TO AND THINK IS COOL? &gt;&gt; I THINK SO. I MEAN, I'M HOPING SO. NOT TO BRAG ABOUT ANOTHER MOVIE OR ANYTHING, BUT I HAVE A SMALL PART IN THIS MOVIE, BUT KEVIN KBAS KBAR NET IS IN THAT MOVIE, BUT I'M HOPING MAYBE THAT WILL MAKE ME COOL AND I CAN INVITE KEVIN GAS KBAR NET TO GIVE THE SPEECH. I DIDN'T KNOW HIM OR ANYTHING. AND I WENT UP TO HIM AND I WAS LIKE, I'LL TRADE YOU, DO YOU HAVE LITTLE GIRLS? AND HE'S LIKE, I DO, ACTUALLY. I'LL SING SOMETHING ON THE PHONE TO YOUR GIRLS AND MAKE A VIDEO IF YOU'LL GIVE SOME ADVICE TO MY ASPIRING, BASKETBALL-PLAYING SON. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: TRADITIONALLY, YOU GET ONE OR TWO CELEBRITIES WHO YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY YOU HAVE A PERSONAL CONNECTION WITH TO PRESENT YOU WITH THE STAR. &gt;&gt; THEY TOLD US TO PICK TWO. AND I THINK WE'VE BOTH BEEN, LIKE, BECAUSE THESE ARE MY CELEBRITY FRIENDS. I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU TO DO IT. I THINK YOU ARE ACROSS THE STREET AND BUSY.

WHEN YOU WERE KIDS, WHEN YOU WERE A YOUNG, YOUNG PEOPLE, WHAT WAS YOUR FROZEN? WHAT WAS THE MOVIE, WHETHER IT BE ANIMATED OR WHATEVER, THAT YOU WERE NUTS POFOR? &gt;&gt; I WAS OBSESSED WITH &quot;MY FAIR LADY.&quot; I WOULD SING INTO THE MIRROR, JUST YOU WAIT &gt;&gt; Jimmy: WOW. &gt;&gt; MINE WAS &quot;ANNIE.&quot; THE BROADWAY SHOW AND THEN THE MOVIE. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: DID YOU GO AS THAT ON HALLOWEEN? &gt;&gt; NO, I WANTED TO AUDITION AND MY MOTHER DIDN'T BELIEVE IN ME BEING A WORKING KID, SO WE WOULD FIGHT ABOUT IT A LOT. YOU COULD ONLY BE LIKE 4'11&quot; OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AND I'D SAY, I'M GETTING TOO TALL! IT WAS A VERY RAHM ADTRAUMATIZIG P FOR ME. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: JONATHAN? &gt;&gt; THERE WERE SO MANY, BUT DEFINITELY &quot;WIZARD OF OZ.&quot; I WAS DOROTHY IN THE PRODUCTION THAT WE DID, IN MY DAD'S BARN. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOU DID A BARN PRODUCTION, HUH? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOU'RE GOING REALLY HEAVY WITH THE LANCASTER STUFF IN THE BARN. &gt;&gt; I KNOW, IN DRAG AS WELL. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: JOSH, YOU? &gt;&gt; I HAVE TO GO WITH &quot;PORKY'S II&quot;. NO, MINE WAS &quot;THE GOONIES&quot;. I WATCHED THAT MOVIE ABOUT 500 TIMES, AND I WANTED TO BE CHUNK SO BADLY AND START A RELATIONSHIP WITH A DEFORMED FIGURE NAMED SLAV. HEY, YOU GUYS! &gt;&gt; Jimmy: AND WHEN DID YOU REALIZE, I AM SURE YOU KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE A BIG DEAL, IT'S A DISNEY MOVIE, BUT WHEN DID YOU REALIZE IT WAS WELL BEYOND A BIG DEAL? &gt;&gt; IT TOOK A WHILE. I THINK, WHEN WE WATCHED IT, WE ALL, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE, SO I CAN SPEAK FOR THE GROUP. WE FELT LIKE OH, WOW, WE BROKE A MOLD, WE DID A MOVIE ABOUT FAMILIAL LOVE INSTEAD OF ROMANTIC LOVE. AND WE WERE PROUD OF THE FILM. AND EVERY WEEK LATER WE WERE CHECKING THE BOX OFFICE GOING, HUH, THAT'S REALLY HANGING ON. WOW, YEAH, THAT'S HOLDIN' AT NUMBER ONE. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: YEAH, AND THEN OF COURSE IT JUST BECAME PERVASIVE. IT WAS JUST EVERY, ALL THE TIME, EVERY KID, EVERY LITTLE GIRL WAS BELTING HER HEART OUT, SINGING THESE SONGS. &gt;&gt; MAYBE IT WAS LIKE A YEAR LATER, HALLOWEEN, VOUSURROUNDED ALL THE LITTLE GIRLS. &gt;&gt; BLESS YOU, I COULDN'T GET A DRESS FOR ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS WHO WANTED TO BE ELSA, AND NO ONE WOULD SELL IT. AND I REMEMBER SEEING BOB IGER, WHO RUNS DISNEY, AND I WAS LIKE, I HATE TO ASK YOU THIS. I'M SURE YOU HAVE OTHER HINGES TO DO, I'M NOT GOING TO LIE. I GOT THE VERY LAST ONE OUT OF THE RESORT IN HAWAII FOR HIS GRANDCHILD, COULD WE SPLIT IT? IT WAS CRAZY HOW IT JUST OVERNIGHT BECAME THIS THING. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: UNBELIEVABLE. DID YOU ACTUALLY GET THAT DRESS? &gt;&gt; YES, I'M ACTUALLY WEARING IT UNDER THIS. &gt;&gt; Jimmy: WONDERFUL. WELL, I'M SURE THIS IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER ROUND OF CRAZINESS. THE MOVIE COMES OUT ON NOVEMBER 22nd. IF YOU'RE A PARENT, YOU KNOW THAT FOR LSURE ALREADY. IT'S CALLED &quot;FROZEN II&quot;. THANK YOU FOR YOUR DRAWINGS.
