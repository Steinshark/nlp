You got your first offer from TCS, right? Yes, that's correct, but it wasn't an on-campus offer. There's an exam called TCS CodeVita, which is an all-India competition. It happens every year. Correct. The pattern involves six questions that need to be completed within six hours. You have to allocate that six hours of time in one go. Through this, I got an interview for TCS. I cleared CodeVita and, as a result, got an interview, which led to my selection into TCS Digital. So, after joining TCS, you started your actual DSA preparation? Yes, that's right. You quit TCS within six months. Many people say there's a bond in TCS and Infosys. I received the TCS Digital offer, and the bond is only applicable to TCS Ninja. There is no bond in TCS Digital. The bond in Ninja is for one year. After TCS, where did you switch to? I joined Samsung. How long did you work at Samsung? I worked at Samsung for one and a half years. What was the package offered to you? I joined with a 12 LPA package. Did you resign from Samsung before switching to another company, or did you manage both together? I managed both together. There have been incidents not just with Google, but XYZ companies -- they ghost the candidates. Like after clearing one round, now we don't know when is the next round. Hi Swati, how are you? Hi, I am good. What about you? I am also doing great. And thanks a lot for travelling from Hyderabad to Bangalore for us. Thank you for having me on your podcast. So, Swati, we will discuss your story now. But before that, let's have a short introduction for our audience. Sure. So, my name is Swati Jha. I am working as a software engineer at Microsoft. Before Microsoft, I was working at Samsung and before Samsung, I worked at TCS for a short period of time. I graduated from BIT Sindri in 2021. How is BIT Sindri as a college? We will talk about your current scenario--how you came to Microsoft--but before that, tell us a little about the college. BIT Sindri is a Tier-3 college, a State Government College in Jharkhand. The placements for core companies are better there. However, the placement scenario for CS-IT is not that good. Mostly, service-based companies like TCS, Wipro, and Infosys come with an average package of 3.5 to 4 LPA. The best placement during my time was with Schlumberger, which offered an 8 LPA package. Alright. And you got your first offer from TCS, right? Yes, that was not an on-campus offer. I participated in TCS CodeVita, an all-India competition that happens every year. So it's pattern is like - you get six questions and six hours to complete them. You have to allocate that six hours of time in one go and solve six questions. Through that, I got an interview with TCS. I cleared CodeVita and got the interview. From that, I was selected into TCS Digital. How many rounds are there in the interview? I had only one round in the interview, and I got the offer directly. Alright. And all these questions are coding questions, right? Yes, all these are coding questions. There are no specific pattern questions like DP or Graph. Normally, you have to figure out the problem statement and write the solution in code. Okay, great. Then you joined TCS after this, right? Yes, after that, I was not allowed to sit for any campus placements. I cracked it in August 2020.So, when I graduated, I only had the TCS offer. How long did you work in TCS? I worked in TCS for five months, then I resigned. So, around six months in total. Around six months? Okay. I also had one month of training. And in four months, my project changed once, so I worked on two projects. What was your tech stack? Mostly, I worked on Linux and Java. Okay, so you quit TCS within six months. Many people say there's a bond in TCS and Infosys. Right. Then how did you quit? Like I mentioned, after clearing CodeVita, there are two roles in TCS: TCS Ninja and TCS Digital. It depends on your interview performance whether you get TCS Ninja or TCS Digital. What was your offer? I got the TCS Digital offer. And the bond is only in TCS Ninja. Okay Yes, there's no bond in TCS Digital. The bond in Ninja is for one year, which is why I was able to resign in five months since I didn't have any bond. Okay, great. So, what was the package offered to you at TCS? It was 7 LPA. Alright. After TCS, you switched to? I switched to Samsung. Did you start DSA preparation after joining TCS? Yes, I wasn't aware of the importance of DSA when I was in college. But during the interview process with product-based companies, I realized that DSA is crucial. After getting the offer from TCS and no longer being eligible for on-campus placements, I interviewed for some off-campus companies. I wasn't prepared for DSA, so I faced rejections. But after that, I understood what I needed to prepare. So, I started DSA preparation after joining TCS. So, after joining TCS, you dedicated time to practicing DSA every day . I hope you guys are enjoying the video. Before moving forward, I would like to talk about my DSA batch. Those who don't want to learn DSA, they can skip this portion and continue the video. Recently, I have launched my DSA batch which is going to start from 28th of August. It is a 6-months batch. And this DSA batch is going to be in Hindi. You will You can choose any one of them and complete DSA will be covered in that particular language. Throughout the course, In the first month, the basics of programming will be done. And in the next 5 months, your complete data structures and algorithms will be done till very advanced concepts like Fenwick tree and segment tree. We will provide you with a very good TA support. In any case, if you get stuck in homework problems or classwork problems under any concept, TAs will reply to you on text. And if there is no doubt on the text, then you will be able to do video calls with TAs. We have made a very good ticketing system for this. If you want to read the feedbacks and see the full curriculum of our course, then I will provide the link in the description. You can check out the course. And if you like it, you can enroll. The course is going to start from 28th of August. So enroll before that. Also, there is a discount going on right now. You can check it out. Now let us continue the video. After coming to TCS, I dedicated my time that I have to do office in the morning till evening. After that, Was TCS remote at that time? Yes, it was remote due to COVID. I joined in 2021. It's challenging to prepare with office work. But when you switched from Samsung to Microsoft, did you prepare alongside office work? Yes, I worked and prepared simultaneously, because there was no concept of work from home. I had to go to the office. Let's discuss this. How did you manage your time, given that many people find it difficult to manage time with office work? Yes, we can discuss that. So, tell us a bit about the Samsung interview process. I went through three rounds at Samsung. The first was a 1.5-hour coding test with three DSA questions, similar to Leet Code medium-level questions. Then first round was a video call interview where three DSA questions were asked, along with questions on computer fundamentals, DBMS, and operating systems. It was about a one-hour interview. The final round was an HR did interview. They asked why I wanted to join Samsung and why I wanted to leave TCS--questions like that. What was your reason then? My main reason was to get into a good product-based company, which was my top priority. Alright. This was during a time when job offers were more abundant, right? Yes, after COVID, job offers were plentiful, making it easier to job hunt compared to now. It's very difficult now. Yes, now it's very difficult to even get a referral. Job openings come and go, and there are thousands of people waiting for just one opening. We'll discuss that. What about your Microsoft process? I switched jobs at the right time, but even then, I faced challenges. Despite getting referrals, interview calls were rare. We'll discuss that--it was during the peak of the recession and hiring freezes. Let's discuss Samsung. For how long did you work at Samsung? I worked there for one and a half years. What was your package? I started with a 12 LPA package, which increased to 14 LPA after two months. So, from 7 LPA at TCS to 12 LPA, and then to 14 LPA at Samsung?Yes, exactly. In this one and a half years, is there anything interesting about Samsung that you'd like to share? Yes, one interesting thing about Samsung is that even after joining, you have to keep clearing tests. There are three levels of tests: advanced, professional, and expert. For the advanced test, you have to solve one question in three hours. That question is based on DSA only. Yes, they are based on DSA.I heard about this from my friends who interned at Samsung. They said they didn't want to join Samsung because of these internal tests. Yes, these tests are used for hiring in Samsung. And this test happens at office and it is a 3 hour test. You have to give that test infront of the interviewer? Yes. And we can give that test on campus also, but there is no option of online. So, this test is conducted during the hiring process, but because I joined during COVID in 2021, so had to do it online. We had to clear three questions in 1.5 hours. Then we were made to sign a deal that we have to clear the test within six months of joining, or we would be removed. So that is the first level of test. Then the second level is that and you have to do 1 question. How many attempts did you make? We get 4 attempts for advanced test and I cleared it on the first attempt. For the professional test, I attempted it seven to eight times and then I cleared it. Did you see anyone who failed to clear the tests and had to leave? Yes, I saw people from my batch who couldn't clear the tests within six months. They were given an extension, but if they still couldn't pass, HR asked them to find a new job. Like this is very different from other companies This keeps you prepared, for switching. Exactly, you have to stay prepared. So either you want to switch or not, You have to give those tests. Right. Cool What else made you decide to switch from Samsung? One thing I didn't like was the strict working hours. We had to be present in the office for 8 hours daily, totaling 40 hours a week. So in that, if we punch in, So when you are entering... When we are entering. The time track starts and when we exit, And the whole day's It is also on the portal and the app. And in between, then as soon as you punch out, And again, you will then punch in, If someone came in late, they had to stay late to make up the time. I used to go to the gym in the office to manage my time better. So, if I have to go to the gym for an hour, I need to take out time separately because that time doesn't count. Samsung is a Korean company, isn't it? Yes. That was the main issue. The time was very restricted. Even after completing your work for the day, when you had no further tasks, you still had to stay in the office. You weren't doing anything, but you were required to remain there. Especially for those of us who joined during COVID times, we were accustomed to the freedom of working from home or from anywhere. Now, being called to the office for five days a week feels restrictive. Why are they calling us for five days? We had three days, but if you wanted to work from home the next week, you had to get it approved by the manager by that Friday, specifying which two days you'd work from home. You can't plan ahead if something unexpected happens, like not feeling well. How would you know by Friday that you won't feel well next week? That was a bit problematic. Apart from that, my work involved Bluetooth on Android. Initially, it seemed interesting, but after a while, it became monotonous. Because of all these reasons, I decided to switch. Okay, valid reasons. When did you thought of switching? Which month was it? So, after completing one year at Samsung in February 2023, I decided to switch in April 2023. That was the peak of the recession. I remember there were layoffs everywhere, even in big companies like Microsoft and Samsung. Wherever we looked on LinkedIn, there were layoffs. Hiring was freezing too, but you still decided to switch. Wasn't it risky. Yes it was When I discussed switching with my family, friends, and seniors, everyone advised me to wait for a year or two until the situation improved. But I didn't know how long it would take for things to get better, so I thought, why not try? Did you resign from Samsung immediately ? I didn't resign immediately. I continued with Samsung until I secured another offer. Balancing preparation and job hunting must has been challenging for you , and the most difficult part was getting an interview during that time. So tell me step by step in which companies you get shortlisted? So, I had decided what type of companies I should go to. So, as I was already working in MNC,I didn't feel like going to start-up. I had decided to target tech giants only, so I listed companies like Google, Adobe, Amazon, and Microsoft. But it was even more challenging because they were also laying off employees, and I had narrowed my scope by only applying to these companies. I dedicated one hour daily to applying for jobs because applying just once wouldn't be enough. Daily, one hour. The job application process takes time, so I devoted an hour daily to it. Samsung already took eight hours of my time, so I allocated an additional hour for job applications. For preparation, I started going to the office early, around 8:30 AM, and finished my work by 5 or 5:15 PM, including lunch. After that, I used the remaining time in the evening for preparation. Alright. So, that was your preparation time. Cool. I had to complete 8 hours. So, before 6, I had to complete it somehow. Okay. Great. So, what strategy did you follow to find a job? For job hunting, I focused on two portals: LinkedIn and Naukri.com. However, I didn't get good responses from Naukri.com, so I focused solely on LinkedIn. On LinkedIn, I used to go to job sections first. And there, the job application has a filter option. You can put in software engineer. You can put in experience. Okay. From there, whatever jobs were listed, you have two options. Either you click directly on apply. So, it takes you to the company's career page. And from there, you can apply directly. or you take the job ID and message someone for a referral on LinkedIn. Given the recession, I thought direct applications wouldn't yield good results. So, I used to take the job ID from the career portal and then, on LinkedIn, there is an option. You can send message with a connection request. Yes. There, I used to write a message in two lines. I need a referral and the reason. And I used to mention the job ID in it. I messaged 5-6 people for each job ID. These days, asking referral from just 5-6 people doesn't work anymore. People don't reply. Now, you have to at least text 20 people from that company. I used to text 5-6 people only. Sometimes, 1-2 people used to reply. Then, I used to apply for 1 hour. So, I used to apply for 5-6 companies in a day. In that, I used to message 5 people in each company. So, I used to message 20-25 people daily. Cool. Alright. And you didn't get any benefit from Naukri? I didn't get any benefit from Naukri. Despite all this effort, on LinkedIn interview calls were scarce. So, you started this process in April and when did you received you first interview call? I received my first interview call from Google at the end of April. It was very exciting. I was already prepared, and the first round was a telephonic interview followed by a video call. I cleared the round, but then Google announced a hiring freeze. Recruiter ghosted you? Recruiter didn't ghost me. First, they gave the feedback that it was cleared. After that, they told me that when we will start again,then we will reach out to you. But, that never happened. They never reached out after that? No. After that, hiring freeze happened. They said if they will resume hiring then they will reach out. So, you should have done it now. I haven't done it now. Okay. At least, they are so responsible. Yes. There have been incidents but not with Google. I am not taking Google's name here. Right. I have worked here. Yes. XYZ companies, they ghost the candidate. The round is cleared. Okay. After that, they won't tell you when the next round is. This is not a good thing. I have heard this from many people. After getting the offer, they resigned from their current company and then their offer has been revoked one day before joining. When I was applying, the seniors used to tell me that you are taking a risk. You are resigning and you don't know anything about the other company. There is a big problem at this time. But, okay. Luckily, everything happened in my case. Normally. Okay. When the next interview call came? Next interview call came after two months. After 2 months of Google's interview call, I received an interview call from Cadence in Noida. Cadence, a Noida-based company? A Noida-based company. It's a networking company? Yes, it's a networking company. Alright. Basically, it works on C++. There were two rounds there. The first round was DSA. I cleared that round. The second round was entirely based on C++. I hadn't worked on C++ development at that time, so I was unable to clear that round. When did Microsoft call? In September. From April? April to September. I got only three companies. First was Google, which had a hiring freeze, then Cadence, and finally Microsoft. At that time, there was already a recession market. And it was my fault that I was applying only to some targeted companies. So, because of that, I got only three interview calls. After applying regularly for six months, you just got three interview calls. Right. Right. It's a very game of patience. Yeah. Even after taking the referral, I was not getting interview calls. Yes Before this phase, the recession phase, there was a phase when people used to say that there should be patience in preparation. Because preparation takes time. Nowadays, people prepare but job offers are getting so difficult to get. Right. So, I think you guys also need to be patient. At the same time, be smart and be open to work at some places where maybe you don't want to work. Right. Now, at this time, people are ready to take offer from TCS or Infosys as well. Right. Earlier, people were determined to join in Google or companies like that. Because at that time, there was an abundance of offers. Now, there are fewer offers. So, you have to be open. if you work at one place for one or two years, then what's the problem? You can switch. Just like Swathi did, you also started from TCS. I started with TCS only. Correct. Okay. Let's talk about Microsoft's interview process. So, preparation must be going on. Right. I was doing preparation parallelly and applying. Tell me about the resources of preparation. What were you following? For preparation, the first thing was DSA. I practiced DSA on Leet Code. And if I had any doubt in some questions, then my go-to platform was YouTube. Okay. To prepare design, for low-level design, I used to practice some questions by myself. And if someone is doing better than me, then I used to go to YouTube only. Alright. And to study system design, high-level design, I used to follow a resource called system design primer. And why were you doing system design? You were targeting SDE 1 or SDE 2? I was targeting both. I had 2.5 years of experience. So, in some companies, they offer SDE2. But in some companies, they offer SDE1 only. For SDE1, because you were targeting tech giants. And as far as my knowledge is, they don't ask about system design in tech giants. For SDE1, right? Right. For SDE2, they ask. But in few companies, they give SDE2 role after 2 years. And in some companies, they give SDE2 role after 3 years of experience. So, in Microsoft, I didn't have 3 years of experience when I got the offer. So, you were not given SDE2 role, right? No. I got the second level of SDE1. The second level of SDE1, that is L60. L60, right. Cool. So, tell us about the interview process. How long did it take to complete the entire process? The entire process of Microsoft was completed very quickly. In 2 weeks, the entire process was completed. Okay. I got a test link. It was a test based on DSA. I had to do 2 questions in 1.5hours. After that, there were 4 rounds of interview. In that, 3 rounds were done in 1 day. 3 rounds. And the last round was done after 2 days. And just after 2-3 days, I got the offer. All rounds were technical rounds? Yes, the last 2 rounds were based on technical plus managerial. And behavioral questions were also in that. Okay. So, what all things were asked apart from DSA? So, the first coding test was based on DSA. Then, the first video call round was also based on DSA. Second round was based on design. Mostly, they were asking questions on designs. Then, third and fourth round both of them were mainly discussing projects. Whatever I wrote in my resume, past projects, whatever I did in Samsung, my work in TCS,and I had also written some side projects. So, all the questions were in details. And along with that, there was a managerial round. And behavioral questions too. Everything was mixed. And all these were online? Yes, these were all online. So, finally, when did you get the offer from Microsoft? I got the offer in September. Okay. Same month. Right. And finally, when did you join? Was there any notice period in Samsung? There is a notice period of two months in Samsung. I served the notice period, then joined in November. Okay, great. Well, it was a very interesting podcast. We got to know a lot of things about our audience. And again, thanks a lot for travelling such a long distance for the podcast. And we have something interesting for you. So, this is a small gift from my side. Okay, thank you so much. And thank you for having me on your podcast. It was a great experience. Guys, like the video.
