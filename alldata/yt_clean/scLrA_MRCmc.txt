This is my mother-in-law's driveway showing you how I'm going to to this (not bad) I took 7 days off work, to complete this project. I think I'm going to have so hopefully in the 7 days I'm I got one excavator from minipelle.ca so I'm going to try and do the excavation you can actually rent an excavator and do it all. I might have it for 2 days though. So we're also going to change the right now it's almost like a Y-shape we're going to make a double driveway and we're So for the path, we're actually going level out the front yard obviously with a and the new path will be right here all to the house we'll make the path come where we're going to have our wooden I only have about five or six If you haven't seen my how to operate It it's pretty much just me learning This is the excavator I'll Are you guys excited cuz I know this is a lot of [Music] What I'm going to be doing now is [Music] I'm going to go in and I'm going to eat. But check it out look at this beauty, I'm Wife: You're not going to do this in a week... Seven days. Wife: No way. You don't think I can do it. Wife: I don't know. Can I do it in seven days? Kid: Yeah Nice! My son believes in me, my wife doesn't. [Music] All right so it's currently 2:35pm, I pretty much finished the path I want to start the driveway excavation see how I posted on Facebook Marketplace free dirt, and I got a bunch of people so I I don't mind doing that for free, if Day one is excavation, day I'm just really hoping that we [Music] There's sadly two layers of asphalt, apparently you shouldn't be back filling I'll be loading up the truck with the asphalt and then we'll go dump it and [Music] So we went to go dump the first so now I'm just excavating and uh I the loads of dirt possible so that's Alright let's go so that lowers this one Can't forget to put this one back up, but there's something else I so now I can't do that because right there so I gotta There we go. So really not what I wanted for day one to start Tomorrow morning 7:00 a.m all I got (DAY 2) a.m. and as you can see I did not But today, we will be doing multiple trips to The important thing is that at least on day Now it's really just excavate dump, excavate dump. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed I'm to complete this project just because really thought I was going to be able to 18 in deep I'm not there yet so hopefully Ah [ __ ]. I ran out of diesel, [Music] I sent off my brother-in-law to go get I also sent him to go rent a plate compactor. So in probably less than I think I'm going to go and [Music] All right so definitely a lot more This is the double driveway area. Now I just need to do this kind of like final I think so far it's been five truck loads I hope he keeps taking some loads. Mr doctor. he's been at it for about All right let me do it. [Music] So a little update it's currently only 3:40 p.m. I really thought we would have but I can't really complain pretty quick it's looking pretty good I'd be pretty happy with this depth we probably 14 to 16 in I did like um seven or eight trips today and I don't know if they still want more I'll have to ask them but I'll probably be able to fill up one two I'd say probably three or four if I could at least finish all the but I'm being optimistic which is good so by the end of today I need to [Music] okay 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 10 loads, holy moly. I hope these people are ready This is end of day two it's 5:10 because I got to go to baseball. I'm my I need to check tomorrow with the string line over there I know we're deep enough I got the truck load I need Good morning it's 7:30 in the morning We are day three. Today my goal would be to Go do one last dump. Too bad the people that uh I dumped the 10, 11 I mean they had their driveway filled. I think I still need to scrape some here, I need to make the nice cut and I need to load this up I'm very happy happy with the finished results Let's start loading this up now [Music] The hell is this... I wonder what this is. Very excited to know what this is. Okay so I just measured from here all and then from there to that piece of wood 23 ft and then I measured from here and there and now is when I'm going to mark my perfectly my beautiful little rock and stick. Now I'm going to mark a nice straight line, Definitely not ideal, but you know what, and some times you got to rent it, and Straight line cut is made. [Music] They will be delivering a 3/4 net stone (clear) 10 tons to fill in probably We're going to try and compact that we're actually going to put geo-textile fabric. I just need to remove a bit here, this everywhere else, I'm getting This is probably the last truck load I got. I'm going to grab the string line, there we go, here I got my string line level. Okay. so naturally the driveway is dipping down. Now here these pavers are 2 the screeding layer of stone dust and we got around 16&quot; about, so 13&quot;, 12&quot; or 13&quot; inches of 16 1/2&quot; 17&quot; 17&quot; Alright, so now the goal is I think he did a pretty good job there. So we're just going to keep I believe this is... I can't remember the It's got really good tensile strength. So let's lay this down before the truck comes. We'll put it a bit on the walls like that, and then once we get the gravel, we'll start shovelling a bit of gravel so We don't want this too loose. So we'll wait for the gravel to do to cut everything up and we're going Alright, it's 2:30pm, gravel just Alright, he was pretty amazed that this is a DIY project. He's going to try and For my future self: Measure three times. Order once. He also said that with 3/4 net I have so after my 3 or 4 inches compacted down, I need to put more fabric on top of it, so my 0 - 3/4&quot; gravel doesn't seep so I think that's what [Music] Oh my God. Hey, you're back! We got a lot of work ahead, you ready? no? - I appreciate your energy, Cool man, I appreciate you. Thank you. - Good luck. [Music] As soon as we got an an inch right here, I could get the excavator out. [Music] [Music] Day three, 3:30 p.m. And we're just raking in the first Good job Dylan. We're just trying to cover up the entire surface and then we're going to get the vibrating And then we'll probably move on to, layer number 2 and then we'll check our height again. Let's do it. [Music] Alright, So day three, Wednesday 5:03 p.m. I think we're, we're tired. It's too bad the stone So earlier today, I measured everywhere and now I'm getting around 12&quot; or 13&quot;. That's about 4 or 5 inches. (of 3/4 clear stone) Hopefully tomorrow with 15 Tons we get another... today we got 4 to 5 inches and tomorrow we should get at least 7&quot; up. Day three is done, it's 6:30 p.m. And as you can see, we did we did it's looking pretty good. I don't know if I'll be able to complete this Which isn't surprising, but I really hope So if you're new to the channel, hit that subscribe button if you like [Music] Good morning day four today, I just went to the store and got this pipe, I got a truckload of 0 - 3/4&quot; I ordered 15 Tons yesterday (for today) Hopefully we get that before this out this morning so we get Alright, second truck delivery [Music] Alright, so Christmas came early today we What I'm going to do now is lay down and that's going to give a good get mixed with the smaller rocks It'll keep them separated, so now out of the 0 - 3/4&quot; and we're going to [Music] [Music] [Music] you boys going to help? yeah. we I need to excavate another 1&quot; I think. [Music] - Wow! It looks real nice babe. Almost there. We need 2 1/4&quot; + 1&quot; so 3 1/4 for and right now we are 5&quot;... 6&quot;... Alright, film me. Oh wait, your fingers. Alright guys, now it's my little My 4 year-old is the videographer now. Say hi Looka. Hi So now that we have these two what we're going to do, we use this now I'm going to measure and we're going to go like this 2 3/4&quot; 2 3/4&quot; [Music] Believe it or not, when I called and I said She said: sorry we just booked up the whole day so we could only put you in for tomorrow and that's a problem because this is day four and we're on a timer [Music] so day four 4:20 p.m. how do I feel. (exhales) I don't know if I'm going to make it. I don't know if I'm going to make it in day seven. We're day four, I still Dylan just told me he's not He's got to get ready for his trip. Which leaves me to be alone for the next 3 days. I'm very very grateful for his But right now I'm just It's definitely doable you know But the driveway, I'm so close, I'm so close. I called the gravel place and they said sorry. No more deliveries for today which meant that I have to It's an amazing truck, it's just Max 3 tons of gravel per trip, which means 10 minutes to 15 minutes to load Then 20 minutes back, so I I just got 8 tons which equals three trips and now it's more a question of am you know dude just hire it out you're doing horrible you're whatever you know so much labor but I like these challenges where I've never done something before I do my research, I talk to some and if I think it's even potentially What better way to do it than I hope you guys watch the video till the end and thanks again minipelle.ca for the excavator. (In French) If you come from if you want a mini-excavator, for a I'm going to get my last load, levelled out after this and if not [Music] [Music] Good morning day five, so yesterday was a little crazy. Probably the toughest day so far in the week, it was a lot of layers of gravel that's the muscles I'm feeling mostly my lower back and uh just the little Sadly I don't have Dylan, Let's see how much work we [Music] [Music] Okay, so yesterday I put my and I had measured to the string line. I got 1 inch for the stone dust, and I got want the pavers to sit 1/4 inch high because So really, I want 3 inches finished I'm seeing 4 inches. I don't want to Yesterday, I was calculating 2 3/4 inches to that compacted down. Now it's at 4 inches, which So now what I'll be doing is measuring between gravel depth with the screeding compacting to see what my finished Have a good trip. Thanks for I'm not gone yet. No? you're going to help. [Music] Alright, I am sweaty as hell. I've completed this section This area is perfect. Here, I probably have to add an [Music] 2 1/4&quot; about? Yeah, let's raise it a bit. okay 2 1/8&quot; One thing I learned with two other screeding bars is I actually bent them by I don't know if you if you take a look I actually bent them real good. [Music] I had a little pit stop at the barber and now it is day five Friday 2:00 p.m. [Music] So here, just fueling up the truck, but my "I'm fueling up the truck for you," If you guys need some tree cutting or if you've Maybe we'll do an arborist DIY video sometime. - Oh! There we go. Or is that too deadly? - No, no, no, it's all good. Yeah? - we can definitely do that. Alright, let's go back. This is day five. We used about half your Alright, back to day 5, 3:30 Day five is complete. I got to go so I'm leaving quite early. It's 4:50 p.m. But all of this has been compacted, as you can see. It is perfectly straight This is going to be our gravel layer complete. We are 3 inches off, which is perfect plus the 1&quot; of stone dust. The only thing I did not have time mostly alone is this area. I ran out of and here we are starting off the path as well Maybe adding a string line and making sure Another option is to focus on the driveway project is primarily the driveway. That's not really the path--although the But priority number one is and then we'll attack the pathway later. Fiona and the kids and Dylan have all So these are the Permacon We got a crazy deal on these--also a Facebook including the delivery. That's how and we got six more pallets I'm hoping that tomorrow we can 'cause that's what we're here to do. But obviously, the foundation and that's why we spent so much time Without the proper foundation, within 6 months to a year, and that's that excavation--getting really deep, putting in I mean, we pretty much did like 16 inches of I'm happy with that. Honestly, the base I think, 1 or 2 inches of And hopefully my kid forgives me for being late to the baseball game. Talk to Okay, so I guess I should probably God damn it! I have behind me here we will be screeding this morning So I'm going to have to snap get all to the right level, and compact it down. The question is, are we able to do it in 7 days? Let's find out. [Music] [Music] [Music] I think I'm done the driveway take a last measurement and then it's day 6. Saturday 10:50am it's looking good. [Music] I am drenched but I think I could say this driveway I want to have the walkway nice and straight so that that's what we'll be doing next so now I'm just trying to get an idea of to make it level with the driveway pull it as tight as you can we're going to put this little guy so the bubble is just touching the line that is a lot of gravel listen I'm not going to complain it's going to have an extremely strong base which is great it just might require so that's not great but we I'm going to try and level all this and the land kind of goes like this to the left all of this land is going if we want to respect and be level we need to raise it up 1,2, 3, 4, 5 blocks of those pavers which is I'm going to spread this out, try and get [Music] [Music] Day six complete. Saturday 3:00 p.m. sadly I can't keep working. We're headed to an engagement party. The driveway is perfectly level now and the right pitch so that is great news. the only problem now is the whole that's that's the slope which isn't great I that's my rookie mistake but that's okay I'm going to set up the string line again and I hope I have enough gravel here Let's go! Good morning! Today is day 7 it's 11:00 a.m. Starting very late on this Sunday morning. Had a party last night and we went In some areas, I'm missing about 5 to 6 inches. Realistically, it should have I'm going to try and do that. I have a family I'm going to try and complete this first section of the path right now with Maybe I'll go do one more trip. Let's do it. [Music] Alright, so day seven was more like just 2 hours. The only thing we got done is levelling So now I'm a bit disappointed. We'll see after I still need a lot of gravel if I make it before 5:00 p.m., be able A big, massive sidewalk piece of cement I'm going to have to grab all this dirt and This pipe, I don't think I want it so deep because I don't want it going into the dirt and I'm going to end up buying a second piece 'cause we're going to have Alright, let's see if we [Music] [Music] Look at that bubble still perfect. right where we want it. okay! I think we only got one more stretch to go. Let's see how close close to completing the path we could get today it is 7:15 As if I thought I would have been done by today, today was not a very productive I got one or two truckloads almost done almost there very very close the tube is in, I'll show you guys the level spout I'm probably going to get another pipe [Music] Alright so day seven now and it's absolutely impossible I really thought I could do hella optimistic but I think I've come to the I mean if your driveway is simple and tiny and not double and not like a [Music] today is technically day 8 it's 8:00 a.m. and I this is really realistic in terms of how diyers work hours trying to get it done so today what gravel maybe after 5:00 p.m. I'm going to to compact it and then we be able to load up the to return that vibrating plate also another stone dust so I have it for the week because are going to start getting a little bit more dust all right we're stuck we're stuck dust somewhere else cuz that pile is big and I'll dump it here but now my tires are just that just means I have to dump it here here uhoh this is bad news this can't be good I'm going to have to call [Music] again I'm going to be a good friend and uh clean yo I just got out I just got out so going I hate rain I hate rain at least that it's really starting to come down now if this was the weather on day I would have canceled this project Work very muddy very wet I got [Music] I understand why people don't want to do this it a day I'm going to wash this machine return for day eight good morning it is 10:41 a.m. worked on this driveway and I'm here today to pavers lucky for me today I got my little helpers the wheelbarrow let's see how much we could get [Music] pause here you go [Music] okay so in this area I got two and are only two and a qu so I'm going to have keep bringing stone dust here until I got make sure to raise my galvanized pipes until [Music] my pipes are now at 2 and 1/8 I'm going to it and then a fourth bar over there careful sword fighting no it's dangerous okay [Music] okay so for this section here I'm going from has a bit more than 1/8 pitch 1/8 pitch is when that there is 1 in every 8 ft that's the pitch every 4 feet I would actually be happy with same thing on the other side so right now this now there's a pitch going that way so that's there and now we have a 1/8 pitch headed in now we're level there and now we're going a pitch that way so that's that's great so I I don't do that anymore because I learned and they are not in use anymore and that's purchased I finally reached the perfect 1/8 pitch on this which is perfect that's that there's also 1 e to a quarter pitch this pitch I'm really looking at it's we were perfectly flat here it would be okay road you guys don't want to help me anymore [Music] [Music] [Music] h [Music] all right so I just snapped a string line line I also just checked the garage door is also leave this line until I start the favers I chose where you would see how amateurish the job is if on the street or the garage floor I'm relying take another string line which is actually my going to try and go about 4 or 5 in just shy of [Music] [Music] all right so I made a mistake and I'm taking know if you guys can see behind me can you inch to an inch right here so it kind of goes the garage door and then we're curving this it quick and I'm glad we did Cu uh that wouldn't [Music] [Music] [Music] can I this mama yeah you can nice good job guys come on kids you're doing great keep it up children I don't know why my friends don't have he's playing blockas a lot or Tetris all right off good morning today's a special one I'm on the driveway this morning I'm going to focus making sure everything's perfectly flat I'm going few hours I'm going to have to leave and go have to leave around 1:30 and then I believe over uh and and help out with laying pavers it's very simple as you saw yesterday even [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it is 11:50 a.m. and I just finished screeing to screet a tiny bit on the path and then this is going to be a problem we're off by about half an inch so I'm going to this so I triple checked everything with actually this green thing that was off so this uh blue string line between the pavers there is a tiny little bit of a gap between try and be careful now cuz this is perfectly four more rows cuz this is the most important it so it's almost 2:00 p.m. I finished screeing I got to go to my kids baseball game so let's see how many rows Eric can [Music] all right so I guess uh that's it for day 10 around 700 p.m. so we really just worked Eric and my mother-in-law worked for it's looking pretty good honestly the driveway I'll probably be done that goal today's going to be a good day it is day late I got the whole family with me today it's but at least hopefully we're done laying pavers on walkway I don't know exactly how many hours we massive stack of pavers over there so there's get [Music] started one thing's for sure is that back and I guess the hip flexors so let's try and [Music] day kind of crazy to say trying not to land them you know like it a [Music] bit oh come stay sit look [Music] Christ let's keep it going [Music] it's right on it there we go all right and at that end over there we got about 33 cut actually I'm going to go measure that three so six rows of papers is 35 in 35 and 1 E so asphalt at 35 and a/4 all the way which will another thing I'm going to have to do because going to cut a piece of wood and I'm going to cut this side 2 in and a/ qu so it sits flush with so when I bring the vibrating plate and it's perfectly flush from left to [Music] 1/8 [Music] pitch this line is perfectly perfect so what we're going to do okay we're going to put them right there not touch it okay we're going to try and our our guide exactly this is our guiding that you got to go all the way around or you could to rain now come on kids let's go [Music] inside be honest it's 3:30 p.m. it wasn't supposed to pretty much finished the entire driveway I screed to lay pavers it's okay we're going to have to 11 my camera's getting wet let's go good morning we are Tuesday 7: a.m. day has to work to get a job done and I know how that's why I started today I tried tried 7:00 brought my little man here we're get 2 hours in before work then I got to go hopefully it's still nice out at 5:00 p.m. I'll and keep laying pavers and hopefully I could show needed you could get stuff done you could have a house you just need to wake up early set your mind that's the other day I'm going to have to do this my mother-in-law will never have a completed [Music] [Music] [Music] h [Music] so I kind of just ran into a problem so at the end and so to fix that I had to dig down a tiny bit I can't screet it without picking up and breaking now the bars are so low that my gravel in the remove all of these rocks I want to have a good uh I have to go to work now it's almost [Music] 9:00 all right so I came here right screed this area towards the uh the front door hopefully crossing my fingers obviously there's [Music] we finished screeing stone dust yes let's go [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we finished with the string line that's it we this tiny little section which is what 12 14 ft all right guys I'll leave you with this [Music] [Music] [Music] that's that's it we're finished no more land no are we close to being done kind of it's now so time to go home let's hope next time [Music] we are day 15 it is 11:00 a.m. and I got a cut off all of my lines and I have everything figured out my first time right now I'm trying to figure uh closest to the garage starting with this perfect perpendic from the house this blue and it was wrong so I'm glad I did it again and pencil honestly I had no idea what I was and as you can see it was a struggle thank time this point [ __ ] everything up are [Music] [Music] [Music] 3 [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so it's 1:00 p.m. now I'm really not happy I'm the cuts done today it took me what like 2 3 pencil I kind of wish I just went straight people make just straight cuts curves are still not even at the cutting part I'm sure than square corners so kudos to everyone that Corners this will probably add me one or two get all the cuts in today but I don't think of thin slivers now that we finished marking and remove blocks like this or at least to do that I'm going to have to find smaller line we don't want this we want a bigger piece so make sure to wear eye protection ear muffs [Music] [Music] although you might think that that was one do about 4 M I run away I breathe and I restart when it starts fogging up the dust it creates wet it's almost like a slurry like a concrete or pavers and you don't wash it off it's going wash the slurry off don't wait 3 4 hours to wash I feel pretty silly right now this cut off saw attachment for the hose that sprayed water [Music] it's 5:55 I'm signing off this lady was down said hey you're not supposed to be so yeah I'll uh I'll stop now but as nice it is 5:15 p.m. and I'm hoping to really happy with yesterday's results and I'm [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] we did it [Music] [Music] it's too bad I can't make noise after 700 I should come tomorrow morning at 7:00 a.m. even 3:00 p.m. try and get at least 4 hours in all the curves and all the other Straits On the but I just wish I had more time so I'll see you for an hour an hour and a half I just want to to try and come uh the full day so I'm going to [Music] a [Music] so technically not a full day just I could keep cutting with the saw and if back or on the front but on inside Corners into the pav and then I'd have to restart so out of the way and then cut trying to follow just go in from the side and keep plunging the time than inside corners but I guess we'll see finishing this weekend okay just for the record I'm being optimistic but I think it's realistic [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I did it I did it and I think I did it in way 20 minutes 20 25 minutes I got the technique down [Music] [Music] all right guys so as you can see I would do it properly I spoke about it with my fine she couldn't see a difference but on how I place them and then put my Edge perfectly positioned before putting in the tell but from up close and when you're right thing I am going to do with these curves [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] n n [Music] [Music] I don't know about you guys but I'm very happy the results actually I don't know what day almost 7:00 p.m. 6:46 I'm tired so about 5 hours able to get all the pavers perfectly uh flush and going to start putting the edge restraint today tomorrow apparently it's supposed to rain I really of the edges including the edge restraint with the of the corners and paer edges all on the walkway to get there tomorrow it's very very good I I'm extremely happy I hope you guys are enjoying it is 8:30 in the morning we are Saturday and that almost looks like cement slurry I think could compact it and probably with the weight of these edges just went right down so maybe if uh how to prevent this from happening so I don't okay so for Edge restraint some people use cement personally used the plastic borders in my backyard I'm just going to keep doing it the way I did something is better than another or if you guys the other and maybe let 5 10 years pass I would two different professionals doing two different no [Music] oh [Music] slowly but surely we're getting there it's looking pretty sick pretty happy [Music] I went back home for lunch and the next thing back and now it's 5:20 so really my entire day tomorrow I don't know I'm really uh I don't know [Music] I [Music] I'm calling it a day sadly it's only 6:15 so under the pouring rain and I've had enough think it's doable let's find out what's up my it's currently 11:00 a.m. and I believe we I lost track at around day 14 at the end I'll hours I worked on this project not just days today's objective is actually to finish this a lie because I will have to come back to of the driveway project luckily today it's not the pathway over there and I'm going to make sure the Eder straint with the 10-in nails all the way why I got the plate compactor we're going to to compact it in we'll make sure that the [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm waiting for like a congratulations yeah yeah [Music] okay so just like with any other product first I got the color beige because well my pavers what we're going to be doing I'm going to turn on the vibrating plate we're going to the to vibrate it in hopefully the the high becomes perfectly uniform and then we're going in the corners or I see that there's not enough we're going to read the instructions again about [Music] [Music] I just opened up the last bought 10 oh my God I feel so stupid enough for the driveway and I still do we had enough po marand to do the [Music] that was pretty crazy intense for the lungs I today anyways I feel really stupid look look at right here and I got a quarter bag in the garage walkway and then I'm going to see how many I got your delivery okay thank you let's take it you think your mom's going to love picture no no no too bad she's in France it'll be a surprise I got all this excess h [Music] bring in the water [Music] e [Music] and that's it my friends the job Landscaping also got to take this down [Music] he [Music] I don't know if I'll be able to complete this it's absolutely impossible that I complete this to being done kind of if any of those projects to hit that subscribe button that like button and opinion so leave a comment down below I'm Mato
