So what's up now? You can't even imagine She checks every dime, Every single day she reminds me that it's her, I'm observing the builders' work at her expense. Well, yeah, she's investing money, It's easy for her to say that, as she works But is it ok that I invest all my love That all my soul is stuffed into every baseboard? She says that if it's her money, Boxes like all those hillbillies have? All the newlyweds come But mom put the house in her name, She said: "Find a job, earn money, give me I didn't get the joke.
