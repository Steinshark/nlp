This video is available with subtitles in many languages. Commitment Today, I came to ``Matsui Honwa Candle Studio'' in Okazaki City, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. Matsui Honwa Candle Studio was founded in 1907 and is a Japanese candle factory with a history of over 100 years. Now, let's take a look at how to make Japanese candles, which are made entirely by hand and using domestically produced materials. First is the process called ``furi''. Pour a mixture of melted wax and rapeseed oil onto the part of the bamboo comb where you want to insert the core, to make the core smoother. Next is a process called ``core cutting''. Insert the candle wick into the bamboo comb. The wick is made by wrapping washi paper around a bamboo comb, then wrapping the wick around it, and finally wrapping it with cotton. Melt the wax on top of the seven wheels. Next is a process called ``Momitsuke''. Melted wax is poured into a wax pot, and the wax is kneaded onto the cored bamboo comb. Depending on the size of the candle, this process may be repeated several to dozens of times. This is the &quot;drying&quot; process. Do this slowly, keeping the temperature and humidity moderate. In the same way, we will also perform ``Momitsuke''. After ``massaging'', let it ``dry'' again. Use the leftover wax over and over again without throwing it away. Next is a process called ``plane shaving.'' Scrape the surface using planes of various sizes. Scrape the surface and make the size uniform. Prepare for ``priming''. Put the wax in a pot and knead it with a kneading stick. The length of the kneading stick is approximately 150cm, and the more you use it, the shorter it becomes. This is a process called ``undercoat''. Kyushu wax is applied several times to several dozen times. Repeat the ``undercoat'' process to make the candle larger. After applying the undercoat, let it dry. Shape it with a plane or knife and finish the surface. By applying it repeatedly, you can create beautiful annual rings. Let dry naturally. Next is the ``overcoating'' process. For ``jokake-nuri,'' we use wax from the Wakayama region. Next, prepare for &quot;coloring&quot;. Check with a thermometer to make sure the coloring is at the right temperature. Check the color condition. We will carefully color each piece one by one. Next, perform the &quot;upper cut&quot; and &quot;lower cut&quot;. In ``Top Cut'', cut the top with a knife to expose the core. For ``bottom cutting'', use a warmed knife to cut the candle into even pieces. Completed A beautiful annual ring has been formed. Traditional handmade Japanese candles have a large flame and are difficult to extinguish even when the wind blows. Also, there is less soot and less wax dripping.

The appeal of Japanese candles is that the fluctuation of the 1/F frequency has a relaxing effect on the mind. This was proven through joint research with universities. Please tell us about your future prospects. I work very hard to make these candles, but I hope to share the charm of Japanese candles with the world. . Please tell us your thoughts as the fourth generation. Since 1907, we have been making our products using traditional methods, and I would like to continue making them using domestically produced materials as much as possible. Please tell us about your future prospects. Japanese candles are mainly used in temples and Buddhist altars, and the demand for them is actually decreasing, but in order to eliminate this situation, we are using social media and holding events to promote traditional Japanese candles. I want people to know the benefits of candles. I would like to develop new products while using traditional Japanese candles. Please tell us about your ``obsessions'' when making Japanese candles. I would like to be particular about making the entire process by hand and using 100% domestically produced materials. In order for people to know about these things, I would like to continue making them with great care. Please tell us about your ``obsessions'' when making Japanese candles. I would like to do my best to make products using traditional techniques and Japanese wax (raw material for Japanese candles) .
