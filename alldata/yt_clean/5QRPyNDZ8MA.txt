IT'S A FUNHOUSE. &gt;&gt; OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, THE HISTORY AND INSTITUTION DEVOTED CONSERVING NATURE HAS TAKEN BOLD ITSELF WITH THE RESTORATION OF MONUMENT TO THE MAN CONSIDERED DURING THE NEXT HOUR, WE GO RESTORATION OF THESE ICONIC WE GO BEHIND THE SCENES FOR A SEEN BY THE PUBLIC. AND WE'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO THE INVALUABLE ROLE IN THE MUSEUM'S ON IN THESE HALLS. &gt;&gt; WHY DO WE HAVE A STATUE OF A WHY DO WE HAVE HIS STATUE IN A WHY IS HE IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM? &gt;&gt; HE WAS A NATURALIST. &gt;&gt; VERY GOOD. HE WAS A NATURALIST. HE WAS A SCIENTIST. HE LOVED EXPLORING NATURE LIKE &gt;&gt; AS THESE KIDS ALREADY SEEM TO INSTITUTION IS INSEPARABLE FROM THEODORE ROOSEVELT. &gt;&gt; THEODORE ROOSEVELT, 26th &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE 20th CENTURY FOX OF AMERICA. THE REAL THEODORE ROOSEVELT WAS TAXIDERMIST, A WRITER, EXPLORER, PRESIDENT. EARLY AND AVID PATRON. HE IS FONDLY REFERRED TO AS OUR &gt;&gt; WE HAVE NEVER HAD SOMEBODY WHOSE GREAT PASSION WAS THE IN AN ERA WHERE PEOPLE WERE THE PLANET, ROOSEVELT SAW EARTH ORGANISM THAT ALL THE RIVERS AND &gt;&gt; BORN TO A WEALTHY FAMILY IN THING. THEODORE ROOSEVELT SR. AND MIMI. TEDDY JR. WAS FREQUENTLY HOUSE &gt;&gt; THERE ARE NO PICTURES OF 3 OR SO. IF THERE WERE, WE WOULD PROBABLY AT THE AGE OF 3, HIS DOCTORS BOY. LIVE LONG. FINALLY, HE GOT TO AGE 6 OR 7 &gt;&gt; HE LOVED ADVENTURE STORIES &gt;&gt; THIS LITTLE BOY USED TO LUG MISSIONARY TRAVELS BY DAVID &gt;&gt; ACCOUNTS OF LIVINGSTON'S IN AFRICA. EXCITING TALES FILLED WITH &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHEN HIS FASCINATION SOMEHOW, IT'S A COMPLIMENT TO HE FANTASIZED, LIFE OF CONSTITUTION. HIS LOVE OF NATURE WAS VERY MUCH NARROWNESS OF HIS BACKGROUND AND THE NARROWNESS OF HIS ILL &gt;&gt; TEDDY BECAME AN AVID HE LEARNED THE BASICS OF BUGS. &gt;&gt; MANY SPECIMENS, BIRDS AND SOME OF THEM HE STUFFED WITH HE DREW THEM, WROTE ABOUT THEM. &gt;&gt; IN HIS NOTEBOOKS, HE LOGGED BY THE AGE OF 9, TEDDY PUBLISHED &gt;&gt; AS A BOY, HE ACTUALLY CREATED COLLECTION GREW. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY. &gt;&gt; CREATED IN HIS BEDROOM IN HIS IT WAS IN 1869 THE CHARTER WOULD &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE ACTUAL CHARTER OR MUSEUM DATED APRIL 16th, 1869. ONE OF THE ORIGINAL FOUNDERS OF ROOSEVELT SR., THE FATHER OF THE &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THE LEADERS IN NEW THEY WANT A GREAT MUSEUM OF NEW YORK JUST AS THERE IS ONE IN THEY CONCEIVE OF IT BROADLY AND &gt;&gt; IT WOULD BECOME YOUNG TEDDY'S &gt;&gt; HE WOULD COME DOWN HERE, HE SAW THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF OF THE NATURAL WORLD. &gt;&gt; THE MUSEUM ENCOURAGED IN INSTITUTION AND A PERSONAL CONSERVATION. ROOSEVELT'S LEGACY WOULD EXTEND YORK TO ALL CORNERS OF AMERICA. AND ULTIMATELY TO THE WHITE THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL 1869 IN A SECTION OF THE ARSENAL TWO YEARS LATER, THE CITY OF NEW ACRE PARCEL OF LAND ON WEST SIDE FROM 77th TREAT TO &gt;&gt; THE SIGHT OF THE MUSEUM IT'S AN ENORMOUS FOUR BLOCK LONG ORIGINALLY CALLED MANHATTAN &gt;&gt; DESIGNED BY ARCHITECTS, THE SERIES OF BUILDINGS THAT WOULD &gt;&gt; IT WAS AN ENORMOUS BUILDING AND MORE COURTYARDS AND MORE ENORMOUS FOUR BLOCK SITE. &gt;&gt; IN 1874, PRESIDENT GRANT LAID PHASE. THAT BUILDING OPENED TO THE PRESIDENT HAYES AND ROOSEVELT IN THE ORIGINAL BUILDING STILL WINGS. BUILT SLOWLY AND IN SECTIONS, WITH AN EXTENSION TO THE FIRST A GRAND ENTRANCE ON WEST 77th IN A STYLE WE CALL ROMANESQUE. KIND OF AMERICAN ADAPTATION OF &gt;&gt; THE REST OF THE CASTLE WOULD THE 77th STREET ENTRANCE WAS CENTURY, A TIME WHEN THE MUSEUM WHEN THE TIME CAME TO RESUME WAS WELL UNDER WAY AND TASTES &gt;&gt; THEY WERE NOT SURE THEY ARCHITECTURAL STYLE ANYMORE. IT FELT TOO ASSOCIATED, REALLY, THE MUSEUM WANTED TO GO IN A &gt;&gt; IN 1924, FIVE YEARS AFTER COMMISSIONED A MEMORIAL TO THE A NEW MUSE UM BUILDING WHICH ON CENTRAL PARK WEST. THE MANDATE, TO CREATE A ROOSEVELT, THE MUSEUM'S GREATEST &gt;&gt; TO SYMBOLIZE THIS SCIENTIFIC THEODORE ROOSEVELT'S LIFE. THE IDEALS, PURPOSES AND PLANS DEVOTED HIS LIFE. &gt;&gt; ROOSEVELT, THE BOY COLLECTOR &gt;&gt; IT WAS A GRAND PROJECT, A DEDICATED TO MEMORIALIZING A OUR STATE. &gt;&gt; TO FIND A GRAND ARCHITECT, WHAT WE NOW SEE ON CENTRAL PARK COMPETITION. THIS. OR THIS. &gt;&gt; THE DESIGN WINNING THE AN ARCHITECT FOR THE ROOSEVELT THAT WAS JOHN -- &gt;&gt; ARCHITECT JOHN RUSSELL WHO GALLERY AND THE JEFFERSON &gt;&gt; POPE IS A MAKER OF MONUMENTS HE LOVED, SORT OF GRAND AND &gt;&gt; POPE'S WAS MONUMENTAL. &gt;&gt; IN ADDITION TO DESIGNING THE EXTENSIVE PLAZA, FROM THE WHICH IS REAMED WITH THE BAR &gt;&gt; THE BUILDING WAS FINALLY FOUR YEARS LATER WITH THE THE THEODORE ROOSEVELT MEMORIAL MEANWHILE ON 81st STREET, THE BUILDING THAT WAS DESIGNED GOING UP. THE HEAVENS. THE HIDDEN PLANETARIUM DESIGNED AS MONUMENTAL AS THE ROOSEVELT IT HAS A MODERN DECK COE FEEL. IT WAS STILL EVOLVING. &gt;&gt; I THINK WE ARE LUCKY IT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAYS BECAUSE CITY, ALMOST. YOU CAN FEEL THE LAYERS OF TIME &gt;&gt; ALL THE WHILE THERE WAS AN ON INSIDE THE MUSEUM. &gt;&gt; FOR ME, DIARAMAS OF THIS ARE HISTORY MUSEUM. THERE'S NO OTHER WAY OF PUTTING &gt;&gt; THE PERIOD BETWEEN 1880 AND GOLDEN AGE OF EXPLORATION OF THE THE MUSEUM WAS AFFILIATED WITH &gt;&gt; AT THAT TIME, REMEMBER, THERE YOU HAD TO GO BY SHIP ACROSS THE YOU OUTFITTED YOUR EXPEDITION THE MEDITERRANEAN, THROUGH THE EAST COAST OF AFRICA, LAND IN AT THAT TIME, THE RAILROAD WHEN YOU WERE ON FOOT AND HIRED &gt;&gt; ON THESE EXPEDITIONS THAT EXPLORERS COLLECTED THOUSANDS OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC AMERICAN PATIENTLY TO SEE WHAT THEY HAD &gt;&gt; PEOPLE AT THAT TIME WERE THE WORLD AROUND THEM. IN ORDER TO HAVE IT, IT HAD TO &gt;&gt; BROUGHT HOME BECAUSE WHAT THEY SAW IN THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO REALLY WILDLIFE PHOTOGRAPHY OR STUDY ANIMALS WITH FILM AND SHOW &gt;&gt; STILL, THERE WAS AN URGENCY WHAT THEY KNEW. &gt;&gt; THE NATURAL HISTORY DIARAMAS FIRST RECOGNIZED THAT WE ARE &gt;&gt; THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION WAS WILDLIFE. THREATENING WHOLE SPECIES OF &gt;&gt; THANKS TO THE LEVEL OF LAST SEVERAL CENTURIES, ONLY PRESERVE IT AT THE LEVEL YOU &gt;&gt; SCIENTISTS AT THE MUSEUM POPULAR PASSION FOR SAVING TO RECREATE THEIR OWN PERSONAL REVOLUTIONARY FORM CALLED THE THE EARLIEST DIARAMAS WEREN'T ELEPHANTS AND LIONS, THEY WERE FRANK CONSIDERED THE GREATEST THE IDEA OF THE BIRD SPECIMENS &gt;&gt; CHAPMAN'S PRIMARY ATTEMPT IN GROUPS. PUT AN END TO PLUME HUNTING, BIRDS FOR FASHION AND THE MEDIUM &gt;&gt; THE FEATHERS WERE BEING USED DIARAMA. AND CLOTHING. &gt;&gt; HE USED THOSE EXHIBITS IN WERE ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION. &gt;&gt; CHAPMAN HAD PULL. HE APPEALED DIRECTLY TO HIS OLD PRESIDENT THEODORE ROOSEVELT. IN 1903, PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT THAT WAS THE HABITAT IN THE SEEING THE BIRDS AND THEIR MOVED TO CREATE THE PELICAN HE CREATED 50 MORE SUCH IT WAS A TEACHING TOOL AND IT THE MUSEUM WANTED MORE. THE MUSEUM HIRED A TAXIDERMIST. HE WAS A SCULPTURE. WITH A UNIQUE SET OF TALENTS, HE &gt;&gt; HE STUDIED SCULPTURE AS AN METHODS TO TAXIDERMY. WHEN HE WAS IN THE FIELD, HE ANIMALS AND MAKE WHAT WE REFER SO ALL THE DETAILS, THE FACE, THE HEAD. THEN HE WOULD CAREFULLY SKIN AND SOMETIMES MAKING PLASTER WAS BACK TO NEW YORK IN THE THE FORM, THE MUSCULAR FORM OF &gt;&gt; THESE ARE CALLED MOUNTAINS. THEY ARE NOT STUFFED ANIMALS. PEOPLE DIDN'T STUFF THEM FULL OF INSTEAD, THEY ARE MOUNTED SO PAPER-MACHE. HAVE YOU MADE PAPER-MACHE IN ART WE HAVE ALL DONE THAT. IT'S LIGHTWEIGHT. YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED HOW LIGHT &gt;&gt; IT SHOWS THE METHOD OF DIARAMA. IN THE MUSEUM, THE DRIED ANIMAL SHAVED DOWN WHILE A LIFE-SIZE MODELLING CLAY IS APPLIED OVER THE FORM AND FITTED. NOW, THE ELEPHANT IS ENCASED IN INTO SECTIONS WHICH STILL HOLD THE FORM AND CLAY ARE REMOVED PLASTER. THE SKIN AND PLASTER INSIDE ONLY A HALF INCH THICK. THE SECTIONS ARE REASSEMBLED. THE TAXIDERMIST MAKES READY TO EXHIBIT. &gt;&gt; DOESN'T IT LOOK REAL? REMEMBER, WE CAN USE OUR PRETEND FOR A SECOND WE ARE NOT WE ARE LOOKING OUT ON ALASKA. WE ARE LOOKING OUT ON THIS WHOLE IT ALMOST COMES TO LIFE, DOESN'T &gt;&gt; WHAT MAKES THE DIARAMAS SO DETAILED HABITAT CREATIONS &gt;&gt; OUR EXHIBITS ARE NOT SIMPLY TYPICAL HABITAT WOULD BE. THE CURATOR AND THE ARTIST DOCUMENTED A REAL PLACE AND &gt;&gt; THEY PAINTED OUT DOORS TO COMPOSITION. &gt;&gt; ALL THE PLANTS AND ANIMALS IN GEOLOGY, THE TYPICAL WEATHER DUPLICATE THE SPECIFIC TIME OF IN THE DAY. SO EVERY EFFORT WAS MADE TO NATURE AND THOSE SPECIFIC, EXACT &gt;&gt; ONCE BACK IN NEW YORK, THE &gt;&gt; WE USED OLD RENAISSANCE CATHEDRAL CEILINGS AND WALLS FOR OFTEN COMPOUND CURVES, SMALL SKETCH THAT'S THEN CURVED BACKGROUND. &gt;&gt; PAINTER JAMES WILSON &gt;&gt; WILSON WAS A TRAINED METHODS FOR PLOTTING ARCHITECTURAL RENDERINGS AND TWO-DIMENSIONAL SURFACE TO THE &gt;&gt; AT THE TOP RIGHT WITH THE CENTER OF THE GROUP. IT'S ALSO THE EYE LEVEL. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH &gt;&gt; FROM THERE, HE WOULD THEN IN VALUE, LIGHT AND DARK VALUES BECAUSE THEY DIMINISH WITH AS THEY RECEDE INTO THE YOU COMPLETE THE FULL CHARCOAL FIX THAT AND THEN START WORKING FOUNDATION. &gt;&gt; AT THIS POINT, IT LOOKS YOU CAN SEE PUTTING THOSE GLOVES YOU ARE VERY CLOSE. BUT, IF YOU DID GET BACK TO THE A SCENE FROM, YOU FIND IT TAKES THE PAINTINGS LOOK MORE BACKGROUND PAINTINGS. &gt;&gt; IT'S AN INGENIOUS METHOD WE IT'S REALLY WONDERFUL. &gt;&gt; THE EXPLORERS IN THE FIELD DIARAMA'S FOREGROUND THAT FROM THE SIGHT. SOME SCENES WERE DRESSED UP WITH SYNTHETIC SNOW. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR AFRICAN BEHIND ME, THEY DON'T DEPICT A THEY DEPICT AND EXACT INDIVIDUAL RECREATED BACK HERE IN NEW YORK. &gt;&gt; WITH UNIQUE COMBINATION OF BACKGROUNDS, FOREGROUNDS YOU EXTRAORDINARY LIFE-LIKE &gt;&gt; HE WAS WONDERFUL AT CAPTURING MAGIC. IN POSE OF AN ANIMAL THAT REALLY CERTAIN ATTITUDE OR MOOD, YOU A BEAR VERSUS THE REGAL PROUD OF AN ELEPHANT. HE CAPTURED THE CHARACTERISTICS &gt;&gt; ANIMALS WERE KILLED TO CREATE CONSERVATIONISTS OF THE DAY FELT OF SCIENCE AND HISTORY. &gt;&gt; HE SEES THE DIARAMAS NOT ONLY URGING FOR PRESERVATION, BUT HE POSSIBLY THE LAST PLACE WHERE A LAST DITCH EFFORT TO PRESERVE CREATURES. &gt;&gt; EVENTUALLY, THE MUSEUM DIARAMAS BETWEEN 1902 AND 2007 HALLS THROUGHOUT THE VAST &gt;&gt; IT'S SUCH A UNIQUE ART FORM I MEAN THEIR ILLUSION BECAUSE SCIENCE. EVEN THE MOUNTAIN SPECIMENS ARE THEY ARE CREATED WITH THE REALLY DEPICT AN ACCURATE &gt;&gt; FOR ALL OF THEIR ART ALMOST OLD FASHIONED. THEY ARE ANTIDIGITAL. ACCORDING TO THEIR STEWARDS, NOT VIRTUAL IS THE SOURCE OF THEY HAVE A SENSE OF SCALE AND IMPOSSIBLE TO REPLICATE ON A &gt;&gt; THE REASON PEOPLE COME TO THE REAL THINGS. IT'S ONLY BY CONFRONTING THE OF WHAT IT'S LIKE, WHAT'S ITS WHAT DOES IT REALLY LOOK LIKE UP &gt;&gt; BY 2008, CLOSE EXAMINATION BEGINNING TO LOSE THEIR LUSTER. &gt;&gt; THIS HALL WAS INSTALLED IN MOST OF THE DIARAMA'S ARE THAT THANKS TO BLEACHING BY UV, MANY THEY HAVE LOST THEIR COLOR. THE PROBLEMS OF HEAT AND &gt;&gt; THE NEW HALL OF NORTH LEWIS BERNARD. &gt;&gt; WE ARE OF THE SAME VINTAGE. I REMEMBER COMING TO THIS HALL OF COURSE, I CAME WITH MY MOTHER WHEN MY SON WAS 2 OR 3 YEARS THE MORE WE LOOKED AT THE HALL, &gt;&gt; HE SEES TWO STORIES TOLD US. &gt;&gt; THE STORY OF WHAT HE DID IN STATES AND ALSO THE STORIES OF THAT BROUGHT THEM BACK TO LIFE. IT'S EXTRAORDINARY. &gt;&gt; IT MAKES IT VERY REAL TO SEE YOU CAN IMAGINE WALKING THROUGH IN ALASKA. &gt;&gt; TAXIDERMISTS DON'T NEED TO &gt;&gt; THE FIRST TIME I STEPPED GLASS. I STOOD IN THERE AND FOR AWHILE, TRANSCENDED. BECAUSE THESE HALLS HAVE BEEN MY &gt;&gt; HE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A FOR HIM, THESE DIARAMAS ARE &gt;&gt; GOOD TAXIDERMY AND GREAT THEY OPEN YOUR MIND TO DIFFERENT EDUCATE IN THE GREATEST WAYS ABLE TO GET CLOSE TO A MOOSE &gt;&gt; HE'S PART OF A TEAM OF ARTISTS WHO WORK ON THE ARE TREATED AS WORKS OF ART AT &gt;&gt; THEY ARE SEALED REALLY WELL. THE ONLY WAY TO GET INSIDE THEM THE MOMENT YOU PULL THE GLASS GREAT PAINS WERE TAKEN TO ENSURE HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; CARPENTER RICHARD WEBBER EACH DIARAMA. TO PREVENT BAD THINGS FROM TAKEN. &gt;&gt; I PUT ON THESE MOCCASINS WORK WE HAVE DONE THAT IF YOU DO TERRAIN OF THE DIARAMA, YOU LEAST IF YOU ARE WEARING SO, THAT'S WHAT WE WEAR WHEN WE &gt;&gt; THE FIRST STEP IS A GOOD &gt;&gt; THEY ARE DIRTY, RIDICULOUSLY THE PAPER HAS DEGRADED. IT'S CURLED. I TRY TO BEND IT BACK. IT CRACKS RIGHT AWAY. IT'S QUITE FRAGILE. &gt;&gt; CLEANING WON'T BE ENOUGH FOR THEY NEED A MAKEOVER. &gt;&gt;&gt; THIS ICONIC DIARAMA WAS IT DEPICTS A SCENE OF THE SNOW OF ALASKA. &gt;&gt; I WANTED TO BE A TAXIDERMIST THESE MEN, CLARK, ROCKWELL. TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON THEIR DREAM COME TRUE. &gt;&gt; THE MUSEUM BORROWED THREE MUSEUM. VINTAGE BEARSKINS ALMOST 100 FOR ME, THIS IS CHRISTMAS IT MIGHT AS WELL BE. THIS IS FUN. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE THE SAME AGE AS THE THE BORROWED BEARS ARE ALSO &gt;&gt; LOOKING AT HOW RICH THE IF YOU LOOK AT THE MOUNTS, THEY THE ARMS OF THE BEARS ARE WHAT THE ARMS. THIS IS REALLY GREAT REFERENCE. &gt;&gt; COLORS ARE SPECTACULAR. &gt;&gt; THEY REALLY ARE. &gt;&gt; USING THE SMITHSONIAN BEARS BEGIN. &gt;&gt; I SPRAYED THAT COLOR ON THE THE CHEST A LITTLE BIT. &gt;&gt; I THINK THE HEAD IS STARTING WHAT DO YOU THINK? THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THING. &gt;&gt; GOOD. SO, NEXT WOULD BE TO TAKE THAT FLICKING AWAY AT THE DARKS AND &gt;&gt; IT TOOK SIX MONTHS FOR THE TURNING THESE BLONDS INTO THE EVERY MEMBER OF THE RESTORATION BEEN. CONSERVATOR JULIA IS FOND OF A &gt;&gt; I PARTICULARLY LIKE THIS &gt;&gt; IT YELLOWED OVER THE YEARS. &gt;&gt; THE VIEWER IS CLOSE TO THAT HAS TO BE, YOU KNOW, HAS TO BE &gt;&gt; THE CONSERVATION TEAM CAME UP DISTANCE. MATERIAL AND SCULPTED SEVERAL IT IS THE TINIEST DETAIL THAT &gt;&gt; I RECEIVED, IN THE MAIL, A SO, NOW WE CAN CLIMB BACK INTO DROPPINGS. THE SPECIMEN TO ADD ANOTHER &gt;&gt; THE JOB OF PREPARING AND &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE ANTELOPE JULIA. AS THEY WERE COLLECTED AND THEY SHAPE. THEY ARE NOT VERY CRUMBABLY OR BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO BE IN IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO CONSOLIDATE SO, WE ARE USING A STABLE STRENGTH. SOLUTION WITH ACETONE AND THEN THEM IN THE DIARAMA. WE REFERENCED A NUMBER OF WHO WERE OUT AND BASICALLY THESE DROPPINGS FROM OTHER TYPES THEY WERE PRINTED OUT AND WE ARRANGEMENT. &gt;&gt; THIS LIFE AT THE MUSEUM, EXCITED ABOUT THE DROPPINGS? &gt;&gt; OR THE MOISTNESS OF A DEER'S OR THE TEXTURE OF ALASKAN EEL OR THE PERFECT COLOR OF FERN? THE TEAM'S PASSION FOR THEIR AS IS THEIR UNFLINCHING &gt;&gt; WHAT I'M DOING HERE, WE HAVE FEMALE JAGUAR. I HAVE ALREADY DONE IT FOR THE THE BEST MATERIAL TO USE IS THE WHAT I'M DOING IS, I HAVE PORCUPINES. THE JAGUAR AND I'M TRYING TO GO DIAMETER OF HAIR THAT IS GOING BEST. &gt;&gt; THE EYE. IT'S AMAZING. THIS IS JUST DRY COLOR. YOU JUST BRUSH IT INTO THE RESTORES THE COLOR. IT JUST BINDS TO THE FEATHERS. &gt;&gt; MY TECHNIQUE IS USING A VERY LOCALLY SO THAT WHEREVER CONDITION I'M NOT TOUCHING IT. AND I'M TRYING TO BLEND IN MY &gt;&gt; AFTER TWO YEARS WITH A TEAM ARTISTS, ONE TAXIDERMIST, RESTORATION OF ALL 43 DIARAMAS 2012. &gt;&gt; I THINK OF ALL THE DIARAMAS, ICON IN THE HALL. TO SEE IT BEFORE AND AFTER, IT'S ABLE TO GO IN AND RESTORE IT. WE HAVE GONE WAY BEYOND WHAT I &gt;&gt; HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE A HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE IT AND &gt;&gt; IT'S KIND OF A PICTURE, A ANIMAL AND ITS HABITAT. THE FOURTH PART OF THE DIARAMA WORK, IF NO ONE IS &gt;&gt; IT'S A WONDERFUL THING TO TO CONTINUE INTO THE FORESEEABLE NATURAL WORLD, INCLUDING DETAILS YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET IT BY ANY OTHER WAY. OTHER WONDERFUL DISPLAYS WE HAVE &gt;&gt; TODAY THE MUSEUM CONSISTS OF AN EVER EVOLVING INSTITUTION REIMAGINED. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A SCIENTIFIC IT'S GOT TO BE AT THE CUTTING SCIENCE IS ALWAYS MOVING &gt;&gt; EXPEDITIONS STILL GO ON. MORE THAN 100 A YEAR AND THERE TO CATALOG AND CURE RATE WHAT &gt;&gt; THEY ARE COLLECTING. THEY ARE OBSERVING. THEY ARE STUDYING. THEY ARE ORGANIZING. &gt;&gt; FOR ALL THAT'S ON DISPLAY IN THOUSANDS OF SPECIMENS THE ONLY A TINY EXHIBIT OF DINOSAURS THE REMAINING FOSSILS AND BONES SCENES. STORIES THAT ARE YET TO BE TOLD. &gt;&gt; THESE ARE SKELETONS FROM SMALL DINOSAURS CLOSELY RELATED A TOOTH IN MATRIX. TAIL SPIKES FROM ONE. 150 MILLION YEARS AGO. THIS IS A CHUNK OF A JAW WITH A &gt;&gt; MODERN EXPEDITION MISSIONS EXAMINATION AND DISCUSSION OF MUSEUM RESEARCH IS PUBLISHED. A VISITOR EXPERIENCE IS MADE EVOLVING DIGITAL. ANOTHER WAY TO ENGAGE A 21st &gt;&gt; THIS MUSEUM IS VERY MUCH THIS IS A VERY EXCITING MOMENT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A MUSEUM IN &gt;&gt; CAN'T FIND T-REX? THERE'S AN APP FOR THAT. &gt;&gt; IT CAN TAKE PLACE IN YOUR IT'S MOBILE APPLICATION. ANYTIME, ANYWHERE LEARNING. ANYTIME, ANYWHERE INTERACTING &gt;&gt; STILL HOST OF COUNTLESS WELCOMES 5 MILLION VISITORS A IT'S AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EACH YEAR. EDUCATORS CAN EARN A MASTERS AT &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOME SORT OF BOUNDARY &gt;&gt; AND A PH.D. IN COMPARATIVE EVERY YEAR THE MUSEUM HOLDS A RENOWNED ANTHROPOLOGIST THAT DEATH IN 1978. THE EVOLUTION IS ONGOING &gt;&gt; WE SORT OF MOVE AROUND THE PRESERVING THE INSTITUTION. FIRST PROJECT WITH THE CENTER COURSE, WAS A FANTASTIC LOOKING ON SOME OF THE MOST EXCITING THEN WE MOVED OVER TO 77th BEYOND. RESTORATION AND PRESERVATION OF &gt;&gt; AND IN 2012, THE RESTORE THEODORE ROOSEVELT MEMORIAL HALL THE PRESIDENT'S LEGACY TO THE &gt;&gt; OUR CONSERVATION PRESIDENT THE HISTORY OF THE MUSEUM. HE'S REALLY PART OF THE FABRIC &gt;&gt; IN ADDITION TO THOSE 51, ORIGINS. FOR THE CREATION OF 150 NATIONAL FOUR NATIONAL GAME RESERVES. AS PRESIDENT, HE SPEARHEADED DESIGNATED 230 MILLION ACRES OF &gt;&gt; IT IS PR STORY. IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR HIM AND PRESIDENT, I STRONGLY SUSPECT WOULD NO LONGER EXIST. &gt;&gt; TODAY, MUSEUM WAITERS ARE LESS MONUMENTAL TAKING HIM OFF &gt;&gt; WE DECIDED TO MAKE ROOSEVELT &gt;&gt; CAST IN BRONZE, THIS STATUE TRIP TO YOSEMITE. THEY HAD EXTRA HELP FROM A T.R. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE GETTING A VERY IMPERSONATOR. ROOSEVELT SCULPTURE. ONLY NOW JUST ARRIVED IN THE I'M GOING TO TAKE THE PACKING &gt;&gt; THE STATUE INVITES VISITORS CONTEMPLATE HIS CRUCIAL ROLE IN MOVEMENT OR TO STICK YOUR FINGER IN THE CENTER OF THE HALL IS A MEDALLION BEARING A ROOSEVELT &gt;&gt; READ WHAT IT SAYS. THIS IS A QUOTE FROM THEODORE &gt;&gt; THERE CAN BE NO GREATER ISSUE THIS COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; SURROUNDING THIS SCULPTURE, A &gt;&gt; ROOSEVELT COLLECTED AS A BOY ARTIFACTS. IN ADDITION TO THAT, THERE ARE OF DARWIN'S ORIGIN OF THE WAS 10. &gt;&gt; AN OWL TEDDY PRESERVED WHEN THE THEODORE ROOSEVELT HALL WAS TEDDY ROOSEVELT'S BIRTHDAY. ALONG WITH THE RESTORATION OF THREE YEARS AND COST $40 &gt;&gt; THIS PROJECT UNDERSCORES AND THIS MUSEUM, THEODORE ROOSEVELT CONSERVATION. &gt;&gt; IN ATTENDANCE WAS HIS GREAT, &gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S A GREAT REMINDER CONSERVATION AND THE MUSEUM OF I KNOW HE WOULD HAVE REALLY &gt;&gt; SEEING HIM IN THIS HALL MAKES LIFE IS SHORT. WE ARE PROUD TO HAVE BEEN PART ROOSEVELT MEMORIAL FOR NOW AND &gt;&gt; NOT JUST FOR PRESIDENTS AND ENGAGED IN OUR UNIVERSE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY IT THAT'S THROUGH KNOWLEDGE AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE PEOPLE THAT MAKES THEM FEEL LIKE THEY CERTAINLY DO AND THE WEIGHT OF AT THIS MUSEUM, WE TRY TO DO THERE ARE NO HEAVY APPLICATIONAL IF YOU WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE DO IS EVERYTHING THAT LIVES IN THIS &gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CONSCIOUSNESS. THAT SCIENCE IS NOT FOR EXPERTS EVERYBODY CAN PARTAKE OF IT. YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE IT BROUGHT ACCESSIBLE AND EXCITING. &gt;&gt; IT IS A MUSEUM FOR ALL OF US. &gt;&gt; THIS WAS A MUSEUM THAT CAME BUILDINGS WERE EXPECTED TO BE PUBLIC, SOMETHING ALMOST NOBLE. YOU FEEL THAT ALL THE WAY &gt;&gt; OKAY, I THINK WE ARE OUT OF ONCE AGAIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH SHOW ME THUMBS UP IF YOU HAD &gt;&gt; PARTICULARLY SINCE IT'S SO AND I HOPE ALWAYS WILL BE, REMINDING KIDS THAT THAT'S THE SENSE OF GRAND. IT WAS MADE FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; FOR YOU, YOUR PORTHOLE TO THE &gt;&gt; YOU COME INTO THE MUSEUM AND OUT ON TO THESE SOMETIMES OFTENTIMES, WILDLIFE AND NATURE THE GRAND WAY THAT THEY ARE AN ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PRESERVING THE BEAUTY AND THE SPLENDOR. THEY ARE GREAT TOOLS FOR WONDER OF NATURE. &gt;&gt; IT IS FUN TO IMAGINE AS HIS TEDDY ROOSEVELT ROAMING THE WHAT WOULD HE THINK OF THE BEARS OR THE NEW YORKERS WHO WE THINK HE WOULD BE PROUD. THE PRESERVATION OF THE LEGACY AS OUR CONSERVATION FORGOTTEN. I'M TOM BROKAW. THANKS FOR WATCHING THIS &gt;&gt;&gt; THIS PROGRAM IS MADE SUPPORT OF -- -- Captions by www.vitac.com
