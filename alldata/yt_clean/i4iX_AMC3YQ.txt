He's a killer, not the sheriff. He must be killed, Pedro. And soon. Here comes the sheriff. Sheriff's hauling a load of dead man Evans, Sheriff's riding into town with a whole mess of bodies. They won't learn He'll keep on doing it. They always kill, always. All right, Judge. But before you say anything, just remember I killed in self-defense. Like always I've got to remind you that once again, instead of applying the law, you've resorted to killing. You've never even brought in one live prisoner, Joe. Those outlaws have a right to an impartial trial. You know that. But you sure don't seem to feel they have that right, Joe. Since you've been sheriff, the jailhouse stays empty while the cemetery fills up, I can't justify your actions before the law. Next time, I'll have to relieve you of office. That's a fair warning, Joe. Just what do you think? I've never gone against orders. I know better. But I have to admit that Judge Tyler here is right. You do carry things too far, Joe. It ain't necessary. Good day to you. I may be all dusty, but when you don't recognize me, Joe might as a last straw. Lara. Did you just get here? Huh? Please, Joe kiss me. Quick. What? Come on, Lara. Listen. You don't think you're brother's night? Uh huh. Get in there, silly. Hey. Listen, Joe. Allen will be leaving for Dodge City tonight. You just can't guess how much I missed you, honey. Why don't you marry me 20, 40, 60... 80. Yeah. I want you to know who you are dealing with. Thank you Pedro. You will always be happy when you join Pedro's band. But now I've got to warn you. Remember, no mistakes or I'll kill you right away. All right, amigos. For now, let's drink! Grabbed my hand, amigo. It's bad for you. Manuel, amigo. Come here. Come closer. Give me your hand, amigo. I told you that you should stay alert and your eyes open. Ah, put away your pistols amigo. Hola, Pedro. You're a fast guy, Clay. You didn't waste any time getting here either. Plenty of men. What's the job? I've decided to kill the gringo Sheriff. We're preparing his grave tonight. Pedro says he dies. And you do the killing. It's not me. You have to kill. Oh, amigo. What do you say we have a drink to our friend Joe Williams? Let's go. Hey, that drink's badly Bartender, give me one of those whiskeys you've been saving up for special occasions. My friend claims he got a good reason to drink. We got a drink to a dead sheriff friend of ours. Ain't that right, Clay? Why don't you and I toast to the sheriff you murdered? Go on, drink Thanks, Sheriff. Well, now we ain't finished yet. Another the little shot won't hurt you, huh? This next round, I'm going to ask you to drink to the sheriff who's living. And this is an honor to the one that you murdered. And here's another one for the sheriff who's living Please, Joe. Who were with the others with you? Frank and Dondre. Frank and Don, figures. Get going. Open it. Hey, you two, wake up. What, what is it? What's going on? Surprised, right? Hey, Clay. What's this all about? You better get dressed. You two have to answer to justice. You boys shouldn't have done that. I'm going to bring you in Oh, it's you. - You've done it. Joe Williams. I heard some more firing. Who'd you kill now? You heard me firing in self-defense. You've had fair warning, Joe. Take off that star. Go on, Joe. Give me the star. You'd better do it. And now you've added insult to injury. Disarm him, Evans. Give it to me. Ooh. Don't worry about me after him. You fool. Let's go. Damn. That's all I needed. Can be far. Let's keep looking. Come on. Hmm. At last. We've been waiting for you. Did you kill him? Did our plan work out well? Well, you see, things didn't go right. He's no longer a lawman. The judge has taken his badge away, and he's left town. But you know where he's gone to? Yeah. Yeah, I saw him. He's hiding out right now in the Stable at Bronson's At Bronson's? Don't forget to make the signal. His horse is in there, but I couldn't see him. I guess he's grabbing himself a snooze. A nice leading fire will soon wake him up. Oh my... they're shooting (speaking spanish) Don't move here. Get off your horses. Must be hiding in the house. Bueno. Open the door. Harder! (speaking spanish) Open this door. Where are you hiding the sheriff? You've come to the wrong place. We ain't hiding no sheriff here. Now get out of this house. Mike. Mike, Mike. Who killed him? You killed him. Let them take care of him. What's the matter, Pedro? What are you doing? Pedro, I hate that. Go to the judge and say you tried to save the Bronson's. Joe William shot you before killing them. Remember, it was the sheriff Joe Williams. Now get going. (speaking spanish) Hold it. Get your hands up. Who are you? Name's Clay. I was shot in front of Bronson's house. Joe Williams took a shot at me. Come with us. Better give Chavez a raise. Because if you get him, that Joe Williams is a pretty good gun. I remember that.

Are you sure they haven't seen you? I don't know. Nothing except that blame Judge. He's sure paying a lot to get me. Look, Joe, you ain't going out of here. You will hide in this wagon until tomorrow. Oh, Alan, I need some more bottles. I'm coming All right, folks. Here you are. Here are some more bottles. I was scared out of my wrists. I was praying, that we might run into each other somewhere in this county. What did you do wrong, Joe? Nothing at all. There. - Thank you kindly. And this is the last. I'll take it. Let me through, will you. - Here you are, sir. Hey, you. - Afternoon Sheriff. If one of these here, folks shows up tonight with a stomachache, I'll lock you up in jail. So, for your sake, you better pray that stuff works. Oh, no. Don't worry Sheriff. You just have no cause to worry. You better hope I don't. Must you really go and see Evans? He ain't your friend. I'm afraid Joe. I've got to. Joe Williams. I'm glad you came. You're welcome. You here to turn yourself in? What do you think? Maybe I didn't shoot the Bronson's. You know, you will have a fair trial. I bet I'll have. You can be sure you will. And if you are innocent, you'll be acquitted. You you think that I'm not innocent. That I'll be hanged for killing? Ain't that your opinion? No. You're just too quick with a gun to play. The sheriff should know better. You can't kill because you represent the law. You shoot first and ask questions later. The sheriff's job is to bring him in alive. Was I always wrong? No. Joe, I don't say always. You're wrong a lot, though. You were too hotheaded, so you asked for it. Admit, that's a fact. The law says I have to arrest you. This is my law. So, Joe what do you figure you're going to do? Things you don't have the guts to do. Good night Evans. Leaving town? I wouldn't. I'm handling this my own way. (speaking spanish) Take this. Hey, what is it? Who did all this, shooting. Joe Williams did it and he ran away with the money. We got to catch him. Evans. Evans! Evans! Evans Didn't you hear all the shooting? They robbed the bank. You hard of hearing? What's the matter with you? Hey, what's wrong? - I was attacked by... There's a dead Mexican in front of the bank. Mexican? I was attacked by - a Mexican. All right, Evans, get to work. Get a posse together. I want them alive. You go that way with your man. You have the money. Where is it? Can't say. I figure you're a fool. or an imbecile. Come a little closer, Pedro. And I tell you. You see, I am an imbecile. You hear that, compadres? It makes me glad to know you. Take my hand. (speaking spanish) Tell us where you hid the money. You're funny. I see. Wait a minute. Oh Predro, the Sheriff. Miguel! Better get out of here. Go slow on this road, Companeros. We don't want to make too much noise. Pedro they're coming, quick. There they are. That's not the way. We'll have to try again. You two go that way. You two there, and you come with me. All right, let's go. So where is it? Where did you go and hide the money Joe? All right. You can sleep on it. Maybe the night we bring you to your senses. I give you till tomorrow morning to make up your mind. Comprende? You two stand guard. And make sure you stay awake or I cut your throat. This way. What's the matter? What are you doing? - I heard something. Over there. It is nothing. Go back to your post. Get up, dammit. You let them get away. Wake up. Those fools, where are they? - Guys! Well, wonderful. I see you have not learned your lesson. So now you must die. But Pedro I know... I know that you don't think so, Lara. But it's for his benefit. I just can't believe a thing you say, you're lying and I won't listen to any more. As you like. You. You agree with her in not respecting the law? Now, look here, Evans. I respect the law, but not when they arrest Joe. Joe is innocent. That's why I'm asking you to help us to save him. Joe is innocent, but he's with Pedro. And if he doesn't watch out, he'll be robbin and killing like the rest of them. Sure of that? Quite sure. All right, let's say it's so. But go find Joe by yourself. I'm not helping. Oh, come on, Lara. It's no use. I want to help him, tell me where he is. Tell the judge that if he wants to talk to Joe, he should go find him. And we don't want nothing to do with it. All right, I will. But just remember, there's no tampering with the law that clear? Sheriff, listen, since your word is law for us, what do you say? When I meet Joe, I'll send you a telegram. Can you bring me the towel, please, Laurie, I left it in the wagon. Hey, Laurie. Are you bringing the towel? I'll get it myself. Joe, don't move in there. You've got to get out Laurie. Hear me in there? Laurie. Come on. Get out of the way. And quick. Laurie Act as if nothing has happened. - What is it? We go around the other way. It's faster. Hey, Joe. Pedro and his men are following us. Hey, ombres go that way, we sourround them. We get them, you'll see. Howard? Give me a rifle, quick. Here, you take the breaks. You're trapped Joe William. Come out of there. I'm all ready out. Go up there. Quick. He's yours, Clay. Cover me. I'll take care of this coyote. Get him with the vulturous. Bueno, we use the vulturous. Listen, go get the vulturous. Joe Williams. I offer you a good proposition. Just tell us what you hid the money you're a free man. I'll even have your go to Mexico. You can't escape, you know. Pedro we have captured him. No one escapes Pedro la Muerte. How do you feel, Gringo? I got to admit, my own mother never fixed me up better. But can't you see I care for you much better than your mother. And I miss you when you're not around and I worry now I see once and for all. Will you change your mind? Half of the money is yours if you tell us where it is half. Wouldn't that please you, Joe? Hmm? Leave him to me. Be a little smart, Joe. It will be better that you accept. Of course. Agree? On just a measly 50%? Sorry, forget it. But I don't like sharing. You are my prisoner. Also, the last time when you got away, remember, Want to continue our fight. Pedro. Ah, yes. Mui bien, amigo. Let him go. Go on, you start. Ramirez, bring me a good, strong rope. (whispering) Get your filthy hands off her. That's enough. Looks like he decided to tell us where the money is heading. Yeah, that's right. Pedro, I'll take you there. There is a smart man. Bring him a poncho so nobody will know who he is. And now get on your horses. Pronto. Come on. Listen, Joe, you better start shooting back. You won't be sorry, because if we win, half the money is yours. Don't be a fool and join our side. Here take this gun and shoot them all. But this time, if you try anything funny, I'm going to kill you. Hey Joe. So you it again. Yeah. So reach. Is this always your law? Joe. This is my law. You traitor! Hey, Joe. Thanks. Howel's goats is where the money is. Do what you have to. Joe. You still don't understand anything. Come back here. Hear me? Joe, you got a pretty good chance. You know, there is someone who can testify for you. Someone who can say that you shot the great brothers, but that you shot them in self-defense. Yeah. Who's that? Me!
