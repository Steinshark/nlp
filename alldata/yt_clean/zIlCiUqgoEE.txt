It's Thanksgiving! Oh, careful! Careful with that knife! Show it who's boss. That is delicious! Wow! Oh! There's a lot going on! What a meal! Oh, wow! There's your turkey! Oh my gosh! It's enormous! That's actually a baby turkey, Because I think we've sent him to a nicer place, A little too early in his life. It's Thanksgiving! This is an American Thanksgiving dinner, Starting with the turkey. Wow! I thought the turkeys my mum did at Christmas were massive, But that is ginormous. I actually got you a pumpkin spice latte, Josh. Okay. I heard that this is a Thanksgiving tradition For many people before spending the entire day, With their relatives. Pumpkin spice latte? I don't know. What are you doing? It's not the bear. You don't need to be chugging. What is that? What is that? Bourbon. Do you? Is this a thing? It's an absolute necessity. Yeah. Spice latte! This is how you get through family gatherings. Bourbon, however you take it, is an absolute necessity before Thanksgiving. Before Thanksgiving. My least favourite thing to do is to carve the turkey. So I thought, great, here's your fork, there's your knife. Excellent. White and dark meat, have at. Do you know what you're doing when it comes to carving and turkey? No, absolutely not. I feel like I trust you somehow. I'm going to go for it. It's a giant knife. You were amazing with the pies. I have 100% faith in you. Oh yeah, it was. Yeah, it was. That was easier. That was definitely easier. Wow. All right, we're jumping in with the turkey first. That is the biggest slice of turkey. You can't have all that as one slice. Wow. That. Yeah. Come on. Okay. Is that good? That's a giant, that is a giant. Okay, look at that. Yeah. He said the skin was good. He did. Show it who's boss. Okay. Doesn't feel like Ollie is the boss in this situation. Oh, careful, careful with that knife. My goodness. I'm just getting a leg off. No, it's good. I'm just going to lean back a little bit. I don't blame you. Just, okay. Careful with the. Oh my gosh. Oh, okay. There we go. I didn't need a leg. I got enough already. Oh, sorry. I just need a. Wow. Okay. Cranberry and gravy. And one of the things you're going to learn is there's always more. So that's cranberry and brandy with little pearl onions. So just pick what you like and then pour some gravy on it. Big bit of skin. That's really juicy. I really want to try the skin. You're welcome. For the immaculate slice of skin that I gave you. Are you thankful? That is delicious. Yeah. Very salty. I told you. It's got like a salt crust layer, but it's a bit crispy and it's absolutely delicious. Wow. Oh. There's a lot going on. Oh. This is amazing. All right. That gravy's incredible. You always have turkey with some bread, so we got some pumpkin bread. That's a whole loaf of bread. And then cornbread too. Okay. A half for each. But you know, take what you need. Try the cornbread with the gravy on it. It's really good. Okay, now I want to try this cranberry sauce. Let's get that. The two types of cranberry sauce. I love cranberry sauce. You know I have a bit of a sweet tooth. That's very different than the cranberry sauce you can buy at Tesco's. Thank you. It's very different. Okay, I guess that's intended. I'm just going to keep on following. Wow, okay. Keep going. What is this? So this is stuffing. So I made the cornbread stuffing. It's got a little pork in it, fruit. The stock that I made from the first turkey that I roasted. Okay. So just give that a go. There's a small portion of that as well. Oh my gosh. I flipping love cornbread. No, I'm not a huge fan of cornbread. I love cornbread. You can't really get it in the UK. I mean, I must say, this, it looks like maybe there's raisins going on here. In the pumpkin bread there is cranberries and raisins and walnuts. Okay, okay. And then the cornbread they're trying. This is more of a southern cornbread. That's delicious. Every region has their own types of cornbread. This is more like cake. I think you'll like it. Yeah. All right. Simultaneously, very crumbly. I want the whole thing. Don't take my cornbread. You can have that now. You've got your grubby fingers on it. Okay, all right. Well now I've touched that. It's simultaneously like very crumbly as if it's dry, but it's really moist. Like buttery. Is that buttery? It's so good. Yeah. There's a lot. There's butter. There's cream. There's a lot of fat. Which is what makes it nice. It's delicious. Put some icing on that? That's cake. Right? You call that cake, I like it. You call that bread, I don't like it. There you go. Yeah. That bread there, Josh, it's not a looker, you know? It looks like something a peasant would eat in the 1600s. You know? Just like thrown out of a king's carriage as he goes past. Okay. And you're there just like digging up mud. I don't know, what do peasants do? Please sir, can I have some more? Please sir, I want some more. What the size of this bread? Okay. You want a big slice? No. No, definitely not. Oh, wow. Look at that. I'm going to take the big slice. You take the big slice. Oh, heck yes. Is Thanksgiving as chaotic as this? Yes. It is. That's what's great. It's a chaotic meal. Yeah, it's just a lot of eating, a lot of storytelling. Everybody reminisces. It's my favourite holiday of the year. Really? More so than Christmas, because there's no distraction from just the family being together. It's just great family interaction. Yeah. Jesus isn't getting up in there trying to take all the attention. As usual. I'm not going anywhere with that. Just die on that hill. What? This is so moist. So moist. Full of, I have no idea what, just goodness. That's the best. Absolutely incredible. I haven't eaten any of it. There's a lot of raisins in there. For fear of the raisins. A lot of raisins in there. And I love a good raisin. Oh, you're right. It's kind of almost squidgy. Very moist. Yeah. I want it with some cranberry sauce. Is that crazy? That feels maybe crazy. There's already cranberries in it. No, it's good. It's really good. Wow. There's a lot of spice. There's a lot of cloves. There's cinnamon. There's nutmeg. Yeah, there's everything in there. There's so much more flavour than in the classic British roast. I mean, maybe that's obvious just from looking at it, but there's so much more going on. You're stretching the definition of bread here. It's like in a category of its own. I mean, I wouldn't want a BLT with that, right? No. Okay. Leftover sandwiches, because that's what you've got to think of. The next day, you take this bread, you slice it, you toast it on the grill each side, slather it with some mayonnaise, And then put whatever leftovers you've got of turkey, sides in there, and just eat that. A pumpkin bread turkey sandwich. That's good. I think Thanksgiving is at the wrong time of year, though. What do you mean? It's harvest. No, because... It's perfect, because we need something in between. You know what we need? We need a February holiday. February is late. It's so grim. There's nothing to look forward to in February. Well, this is also in the UK. They try with Valentine's Day. You don't see the sun, right? But then you always, I don't know, you always get it wrong, and then, you know, you're in the doghouse. Oh, wow. You know? Oh, I don't want to celebrate it. But, okay, well then let's not celebrate it, you know? These are a little warm. So be careful not to touch the sides. What is that? We're starting sides, because you're just taking forever together. We're taking sides. Oh, sorry. Pumpkin mac and cheese. So we're starting in on some smaller sides. Pumpkin mac and cheese? It's not that small, is it? Alright. That looks like a whole main course. Oh, wow. I'm getting more and more thankful as the meal goes on. Is that the point of it? Yeah. Just like plow you with so much food and pumpkin spice goodness that you have to be thankful. Here, I'm helping. I'm just going to serve. Oh my gosh. What is that? I'm going to serve you with sprouts. So this is sprouts with toasted walnuts. Oh. And a little bit of gravy. Those are Brussels sprouts. Yeah. Wow. Those do not look like Brussels sprouts. And your plate up. Oh yeah, okay. They're in there. So I'm not a huge, oh there you go. There's an extra one. You jumped on it. Lovely. I'm not a huge vegetable fan myself. Okay. So I like, when I was growing up and all the stuff we have always has sauces on it because, It's kind of to mask the veg. Yeah. So that's, this is one of them. So it's got a sweet and thinnard grite that's made with sorghum. It's got toasted walnuts in it. And then I just really burn and crisp up the outside of the Brussels sprouts. Lovely. So the outside's crispy and the inside's nice and gushy. Wow. We used to serve ourselves at Christmas all the food. Yeah. Me and my cousins, we'd try and eat the Brussels sprouts as quickly as possible. So we didn't have to say thank you to god for them. Before grace. Yeah, yeah. Before grace. So we just gobbled them down. That's fantastic. Oh yeah. Oh wow. I'm barely tasting Brussels sprouts. Oh yeah. It's amazing. The best way to have Brussels sprouts. I would happily thank god for those. Oh the texture's good. Oh my gosh. Pumpkin mac and cheese. We're really embracing the sort of season here. Whoa. This is thick. Oh my gosh. Chunky. Look at that. Can you see this? Look at that. You're not supposed to eat all of that at once. Oh sorry. Oh that is beautiful. Oh wow. That's really good. You know what? The pumpkin texture. It just slips in there. You know? Yeah. It just slips in. And it fits. Because pumpkin texture's a bit strange. But it's not that different from a mac and cheese texture. Oh that's perfect. So you can just slide it in there unnoticed. You take a bite and you're like, there's something weird about that. What is that? This is string beans. So it's a vegetable. But it's coated with a lot of cheese. It's got some chili in it. It has a homemade mushroom soup. So my mum used to make this. Sorry. And we used canned mushroom soup to make this. Which is still delicious. But this is a slightly different variation on it. But just, it's another way to hide some vegetables. Did you say there's string beans? There's string beans in there. If you dig around the cheese. See there's one. I have to show you. Okay. And chilli. And just getting more and more unhinged. Excellent. Yeah. This looks like a failed lasagna. That's what it looks like to me. Oh, okay. See, look at the string beans coming out. Oh yeah. No, you're right. There are quite a lot of beans. There are. How have you made these string beans taste good? See? I don't like beans normally like this. I told you. These are really good. Creamy. Which I guess is the mushroom soup. Yeah. My gosh. There's so much going on. And again, everything's extremely healthy. If you take out the butter. In some cases, the maple syrup. This is a vegetable that we didn't put sugar in, but I put some meat in it to make it better. So this is a smoked ham hock with collard greens. And that is one of my favourite things. So you can have this with a little bit of the corn bread and you can bring a whole meal out of that. That's like a great lunch. We've had collard greens a couple of times. Yeah. I haven't always loved it. No. I'm a little confused as to what collard greens. Are they smart casual greens? What are they? Yeah. Collard greens. Back home we'd have them. So when I grew up, we'd have some mustard greens. So they're super bitter. Oh yeah. We've had them and they've been bitter. Yeah. So you cook them down. Try these and see if you like them a little better. With smoked ham hock. Bring the greens. That's not bitter at all. I have no idea how that works. That's good. You know, I'm feeling the lack of sugar and butter. There you go. I am. Oh yeah. I think if you added sugar and butter to that, maybe maple syrup would probably be better. It would be even better. Yeah, well maybe. It probably would. But that is, I mean, do you remember the first time we had it? I think they were cooked with lemon. They were so sour. But it's good that you said you were missing. Yeah. Oh really? So this is corn. This is what I've done with corn. Oh my gosh. This is so big. So it's corn with ricotta cheese and cheddar cheese. And it's baked like a little souffle. I'm sorry? As in sweet corn? It's sweet corn. So cheesy corn, baked as a souffle. Cheesy ricotta corn. Look at that. And it's got fresh basil. Wow. Honest to goodness. This is my, I keep saying this is my favourite. I'm a pig at Thanksgiving. I feel like that's sort of the point. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Wow. That is decadent. So much cheese. Oh wow. I don't really have any reference point for that. It's delicious. It's kind of like, it's kind of like a cheesy omelette if you replace all of the egg with cheese. So it's just, you know, it's just cheese. It's a bit of corn. There's corn in there. This is making me think about what I'm going to cook for Christmas dinner for my family. I mean, this is, we don't really get that adventurous with Christmas dinner normally. Well at least like the average pub you go to for Christmas dinner. They'll serve you these same ingredients every single year, every time. Well the thing is, we're still at an age where our parents, generally our parents are still alive. They've established the Christmas traditions. And so they're doing what they've always done. But that won't always be the case. At some point we're going to have to start establishing traditions. This is true. Introduce some of this stuff. This is good background research. Introduce some of this stuff. So this is, and I have to say, a small sampling of a traditional Thanksgiving dinner. Because there usually are more sides. I mean, everybody's going to say, I'm sure, oh you didn't have this, you didn't have that. Because it's true. There's a wide selection of great stuff. So obviously America is much bigger than the UK. And I suppose even within the UK, if you go up north and different areas, People will have slightly different things at Christmas, right? I get the impression America is much bigger, more culturally diverse. Presumably not everyone's having exactly the same thing at Thanksgiving. Not everybody's having exactly the same thing. Like my family, my mum was from Cuba. We would have black beans and rice with all of this as well. So that's exactly what I'm saying. Just an extra on the side. This is a pretty big sampling, but every family has their own cultural reference points. Or they have specific to the region. Because this is very, I think, very southern skewed, what you're having. This is your family's version. That's where I grew up. Brief break. This is when you would go check to see what time the games were starting. And then dessert comes out. Normally, like at this point in a meal, I have like to have a distinct, Clear impression in my mind of like what my favourite thing was. It's very hard to do that with this. Because everything is so new. There's so much amazing new flavours. Do you know what I mean? It was like the first time we went and tried southern fried chicken for the first time. And they just threw like all these new flavours at you. And it's just overwhelming. You're like, what? It's just so interesting that there's like this whole holiday that has all these different traditions. We think of ourselves as quite similar to America. You know, we speak the same language. We have a lot in common. We used to own them. We burnt down the White House. It's a historical fact. We burnt down the White House. We did. Well, you may have noticed we have our own Jolly t-shirts now. Little cheeky takeout merch. If you want to get your own Jolly t-shirt, go to jolly.store or click the link in the description. You'll be very thankful you did. Very thankful. Oh my gosh. So we had sweet potato pie, pumpkin pie and pecan pie last time. That's true. And those are a lot of traditional, classic Thanksgiving pies. And you now have coconut custard and that is buttermilk pie, which interestingly enough is a recipe, Specifically from the great grandmother of one of your viewers. What? Sorry? So what are the Jolly viewers? Yeah, one of the Jolly viewers. And we've been chatting a lot of them. They've been great and we've been having a lot of conversations. That's so sweet. And this is from the last Jolly video. People reached out to you. That's from the last Jolly video. And shared some stories, which has been fantastic. So I'm always happy to hear about family recipes and that one should be really delicious. And your favourite sweet potato pie. Because this is a Thanksgiving must have. That's nice. I mean that's just, that's such a showstopper pie, isn't it? Look how good that looks. Do you want to start with the milky boy? Yeah, let's do it. Look at that. Oh, wow. Very soft texture. Oh, wow. It almost looks like it's literally just melted butter in there. Oh, wow. That is so creamy. It's so good. So buttery. It's so good. So sweet. It's like a pre evolved cheesecake, you know? Interesting. You know, like the milk hasn't quite made it to cheese yet. Interesting. Unchurned. It's earlier in the evolutionary process. Oh, you should try that. Do you know what I mean? Yes. Like cake batter. It's a classic Southern pie because you always have buttermilk. I grew up having buttermilk in the mornings and I used to not like it so much, And now I really do like it. It's just nice, sour and good for your gut. So look again, again, health benefits. Healthy. The gut biome. It's not going to maintain itself. Exactly. 100%. Could you make a Yakult pie? All right. That is so good. I know. I've literally had to stop myself. I'm forcing myself to not finish that. Next up. This is coconut custard. Wow. You can see the sort of shredded coconut. Cheers, mate. Cheers. It's like that one. With loads of coconut. Loads of coconut. And custard. The aftertaste is all custard. I love that. The initial taste is all coconut. You know what? It's a genius move putting custard inside a pie. Because normally you put custard on top. But you're saving yourself all of the effort of pouring the custard on. Can I just say, David, all of your pies, incredible crust. The crust is top notch. Best pie crusts I've ever tasted. Without even any of the fillings in them. Look at that. Congratulations to me on that slice, by the way. Bloody brilliant, mate. Wow. Is this crazy? I really want to do this with my hands. Wow, David. Oh, I feel like that's even better than last time. Now, I feel like I've heard about people having this as one of the sides, as part of the main course. Since we were having the pie, but yes, you would have sweet potatoes in all kinds of different fashions. You can even have a mash. So you could have it as dessert if you want. You could have it as main. Why limit yourself? Amazing. America, the land of the free. This is liberty right here. That is freedom to just take a giant pie and stick an enormous meringue on it and eat with your hat. And at what point in the meal do you go around and say what you're thankful for? Is that something that people actually do or is that just in the movies? Everybody's different. Some people, you know, say grace beforehand. We didn't. We just ate. My family, we just thought about what we were thankful for as we were feasting. It was usually the food. We just got straight into it. Well, I am very, very thankful to you, David, for not only feeding us just incredible food, But I feel like giving us a genuine cultural experience that we wouldn't be able to otherwise have. I'm glad to do it. I'm thankful for you too, David. Obviously he started with that, so it feels like lame if I'm just going to repeat it. You need to come up with your own. But yeah, same. Ditto. I'm also thankful for all of our viewers. Hey, very good. Because without them, this wouldn't be possible. Oh, you're also same with that? I'm saying. It was implied in my thankfulness because it wouldn't be possible without them. All right. Just for us to be here. So we're both thankful for the same things.
