He's always not the target audience. Room temperature... for everything that we do. And as much as I'm concerned about... For those of you who don't It's not just that. It's also. People talk about how it's unhygienated to eat a burrito this way. No, they talk about how it's unhygienated to eat a Thank you for using my word. You're not using your bare hands.

And then you just take No, you would have to also hike with the order to make what you're doing work. Right. You don't get that. How did the burrito not fall out? Now, I am interested in... if you took that all the way down and then you did this. Now we're talking. Now you've got a wet burrito Well, let me see if I can... That's gonna do it, man. Let me see. Well, it's pretty much just salsa. Now, I got. But... maybe we didn't do it in the right order, what I did. Yeah, it was a great idea. Just put the lid on. What? Put the lid on and shake it. Shake it to get the burrito... to start floating in the... I think I know what to do. Salsa. I just. I mean, it's cool looking... It didn't keep it warmer, I gotta swing it. See? So he's getting the.

I'm gonna need to maybe just pour it. Yeah, pour it in the box. Too much salsa. Yeah. I wonder who did that. Way too much salsa... But now, which I didn't I think this is an added But wet burritos is not salsa. It's enchilada sauce. That. You use that enchilada sauce in there Look at that. Tell me that's actually. Boy, that's appetizing. I mean, you don't have to keep adding salsa. And you've solved the hiking problem. You said it looks cool. You said it looks cool.

I would go on a hike. I'd be out there, and then the moment of releasing and I would go back to my car. I'd be afraid. I wanted people to just I'd be afraid to let people If you all of a sudden get to the top of the mountain if you have friends with you, You know what I'm saying? Not if you share it. Okay, Take a bite of this. Too much sauce. Too much sauce. See, you don't want to. What if you're really on the go? I think that is the thing.

In there. That's a whole fan in there. Look. I cut it off and you see? I don't see the fan. Watch, watch. Oh, there it is. Oh, it collapses. And then there and then. Watch this. It's got some blades Oh, now I'm doing water. So you're spraying. Oh, and he's walking, too. Hey, I'm making a viral video. Oh, and it's so hot. Why is it so wet? So the wetness is going up, It's so hard going viral. What is happening? You go viral as hard as I do. It's hard. But can you explain? I can't see where there's water. I don't know what's happening. Hey, man. The Breeze Life. Listen, the Breeze Life. Is that the name of it? The Breeze Life is like magic. I got water down here and I'm pumping it. And it's going into the fan, right? And then it's fanning on me. It's also dripping quite a bit, but if it was hot, I wouldn't care. I mean, I don't want this because I'm gonna compare it to the old school. And I'm also gonna be on a getaway. Okay, okay. I'm really into this. I think this is gonna take our like, Where's my. Oh, my gosh, Thelma. I'm so hot as I'm running from the cops See? So I've got.

I'm actually getting a No, you see how much I'm dripping? It actually feels great under this thing. We got the drip. Oh, my gosh. We gotta go. So how much was this thing again? How much? $79.99? $69.99. Okay. Again. I just kind of feel like I might I think the. The problem with this but that doesn't seem to be working well. I kind of feel like what would that I just had a water bottle in this hand. And then I would be like, that's just the base of my umbrella and there's also a fan. And then I would get into a conversation, and then I would feel a little bit And plus, it would be really awkward... Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm making sure I'm wet under here.
