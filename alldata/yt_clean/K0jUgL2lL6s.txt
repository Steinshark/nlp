You are on the channel It's Delicious! Today I will cook fish hodgepodge. This is a very fragrant, rich and satisfying dish. I have two kinds of fish today. This is salmon and pike perch. A list of all the ingredients will be at the end of the video, and I will start cooking. For the broth, I bought this soup set. This is the head, tail, spine and abdomen of salmon. I removed the gills. And this is a perch. I bought it whole, butchered it, also removed the gills. This set will also go into the broth. You can take sea bass, or cod. But I will add the fillet directly to the hodgepodge. For the broth, I use onions, dill and parsley stalks, I rewound them with a thread for convenience, and later I will add bay leaves and black peppercorns. I put everything in a saucepan, fill it with water and put it on the stove. If you like fish soups, then I have a very tasty Norwegian fish soup on my channel. You can watch the video by clicking on the link in the upper right corner. At low power, bring to a boil, as soon as the foam begins to gather, I remove it. After I removed all the foam, I send bay leaves and peppercorns to the broth. I do not salt the broth, because then a lot of salty ingredients are added to the soup. I cook the broth for about 30 minutes. Then I take out the fish. I filter the broth. I disassemble the fish, it has already cooled down a bit, I definitely take out the cheeks, remove the meat from the tails and from the ridge, so that later I can add it to the finished hodgepodge. Just take it apart very carefully so that small bones do not fall into the hodgepodge. Here is my plate of fish. And I also have a recipe for a combined meat hodgepodge on my channel. You can watch the video by clicking on the link in the upper right corner. Now I will prepare everything else. I cut the onion into small cubes. I rub the carrots on a coarse grater. Pickled cucumbers are added to the hodgepodge. They are small, I will not clean them. I will cut them into small cubes. I will cut the black olives in half, but they can be left whole, or cut into circles. Capers are also added to the fish hodgepodge. I'll grind them up a bit too. But if you do not have capers, then this is not a reason to refuse hodgepodge, cook hodgepodge without them. It remains to cut the greens. I have dill and parsley. I will add green olives to the whole hodgepodge. And it remains to prepare the fish. Here I have chopped salmon belly. I cut the pike perch fillet into small cubes. It's time to give the recipe a thumbs up. Do this so that as many viewers as possible watch the video. So you will help the development of my channel Warm up vegetable oil. I send onions and carrots to the pan. I fry on medium power for 5-7 minutes. Then I add cucumbers and cook for another five minutes. Then I add chopped tomatoes. You can also add tomato paste. A little more and the frying is ready. If you like fish, then I have a pretty simple and delicious sea bass recipe on my channel. You can watch the video by clicking on the link in the upper right corner. My broth boiled, I send the frying into it. Fish fillet. Potatoes are not added to the fish hodgepodge, but if you want, then this is not prohibited. It remains to add olives. I add green olives along with a small amount of brine. Capers. Cook until the fish is ready for five minutes. I add the part of the fish that was boiled in the broth and greens. Now I'm going to try the salt. I need to add some salt. Definitely ground pepper. And the brine is ready. When serving, add a slice of lemon to a plate, as well as a little lemon juice to taste. You can try.
