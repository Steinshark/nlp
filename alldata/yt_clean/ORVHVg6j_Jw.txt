THERE'S A LOVE IN HERE TONIGHT. I SEE PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA GET FREE TONIGHT. Woman: WHOO! WE'RE JUST GONNA LOVE THE CHAINS OFF OF YOU TONIGHT. Man: YEAH! Ling: ZACH WILCOX IS ON THE PULPIT TONIGHT. Wilcox: I HAD A DREAM LAST NIGHT. A YEAR AGO, HE WAS LOST, TAKING DRUGS AND GETTING INTO TROUBLE WITH THE LAW. Wilcox: STAND UP ON YOUR FEET IF YOU'RE HUNGRY! HE'S GONNA GIVE IT TO YOU TONIGHT! THEN, HE SAYS, GOD HEALED HIM. Wilcox: TAKE YOUR PEOPLE AND RIDE UP. WE'RE HUNGRY TONIGHT! WE'RE HUNGRY TONIGHT! THE HUNGER IS WHAT BRINGS YOU THROUGH YOUR BREAKTHROUGH, BECAUSE YOU STARVE YOUR WAY THROUGH IT! YES! NOW ZACH BELIEVES GOD WANTS HIM TO HEAL OTHERS. YEAH! AT 20, HE'S A STUDENT HERE AT THE MorningStar CHRISTIAN MINISTRIES IN SOUTH CAROLINA, LEARNING TO BE A FAITH HEALER. Wilcox: JESUS' NAME. IT'S AN ANCIENT PRACTICE AND, IN 21st-CENTURY AMERICA, A GROWING ONE. ...THIS NEXT GENERATION. TONIGHT WE TRAVEL INSIDE THIS WORLD TO MEET THE PEOPLE WHO COME WITH GREAT HOPE, IN SEARCH OF GREAT MIRACLES... ...AND THE PEOPLE THAT PROMISE THEM. SICKNESS, DISEASE, DEVIL -- STOP! AMERICA -- IT CAN BE INSPIRING AND BEAUTIFUL... IT CAN ALSO BE DARK AND UGLY. IT'S SO MANY THINGS... BUT IT'S OURS. IT'S... FAITH HEALERS ARE AS OLD AS THE BIBLE, BUT EVEN IN THIS AGE OF MODERN MEDICINE, MORE THAN 50% OF AMERICANS BELIEVE GOD CAN HEAL THE SICK. WHAT DREW ME TO THIS STORY, THOUGH, ISN'T WHAT SCIENCE CAN PROVE. IT'S WHAT INSPIRES PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IN MIRACLES. LET'S JUST SAY THIS HAS CHALLENGED EVERYTHING I THOUGHT I KNEW ABOUT FAITH. LET'S GO INSIDE. THE FIRST VIEW OF MorningStar CHRISTIAN MINISTRIES IS THIS -- REMNANTS OF A FORMER THEME PARK AND A NONDESCRIPT HOTEL COMPLEX. IT MAY NOT LOOK IT, BUT THIS IS THE PLACE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE COMING IN SEARCH OF SOMETHING ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE. THEY'RE COMING TO GET HEALED BY GOD. I WAS RAISED WITH RELIGION. I WENT TO BIBLE CAMP AND CHURCH WITH MY FAMILY IN CALIFORNIA, AND IN MY TRAVELS AROUND THE WORLD, I'VE ADMIRED THE POWER OF FAITH IN MANY DIFFERENT CULTURES. BUT NOW, AS I APPROACH THIS STORY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. READY? WE ARE HERE AT THE MorningStar CHURCH. IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A HOTEL, BUT IN ACTUALITY, IT IS A CHURCH. AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A PRETTY BIG HEALING SERVICE TONIGHT, AND THEY'RE EXPECTING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO ASSEMBLE ALREADY. TURN THE CAMERA AROUND. YOU CAN SEE IT'S ALREADY BEGUN. THANK YOU, JESUS. FROM WHAT WE'RE SEEING, IT LOOKS LIKE SOME HEALING IS HAPPENING, AND WE ARE GONNA WANT TO WITNESS IT OURSELVES. IT ALL STARTS NOW, ON THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE HEALING CONFERENCE. Bentley: SOMEBODY ASKED ME TODAY, &quot;WHAT'S HAPPENING DOWN THERE IN CHARLOTTE?&quot; YOU CAN'T CONTAIN THE HUNGER. I IMMEDIATELY SENSE THIS IS A LONG WAY FROM THE ROOTS OF PENTECOSTAL FAITH HEALING BORN IN SMALL, RURAL CHURCHES 100 YEARS AGO. THIS IS OUTSIZED... WE NEED THE NEXT GREAT AWAKENING. ...RIGHT DOWN TO THE PREACHER, TODD BENTLEY. I'M NOT SATISFIED UNTIL I SEE THE GLORY OF GOD. I'M NOT SATISFIED UNTIL I SEE THE MIRACULOUS. I'M NOT SATISFIED! DESPITE HIS TATTOOS AND PIERCINGS, HIS MESSAGE IS STRAIGHT OUT OF THE GOSPEL. I READ THE GOSPELS. I READ REVIVAL. I READ CHURCH HISTORY, AND I SEE POWER. AND I DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONLY ONE BEING A MODEL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TODD BENTLEY PREACHES THAT WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE BIBLE IS LITERALLY TRUE. THE SIGNS AND WONDERS THAT EXISTED IN JESUS' TIME -- THE HEALING OF THE SICK AND DYING -- THESE THINGS ARE STILL POSSIBLE TODAY. AND THAT PROMISE, THAT HOPE FOR A MIRACLE, IS WHY PEOPLE COME. Ling: THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HERE RIGHT NOW. THIS ONE MAN BEHIND ME IN A WHEELCHAIR HAS BEEN SITTING IN THE SAME PLACE. I'VE WALKED PAST HIM SO MANY TIMES, AND HE'S JUST SO INTENTLY LISTENING AND LOOKING REALLY HOPEFUL. I IMAGINE HE'S HERE TO BE HEALED. Man: WHOA! [ SCATTERED APPLAUSE ] HI, SIR. HI. MY NAME'S LISA. WHAT? MY NAME IS LISA. HI, STEVE. CAN WE TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ON CAMERA? IS IT OKAY? WILL WE BE DISRUPTING YOU? NO. OKAY. WHY DID YOU COME? SO, YOUR LEGS JUST DON'T MOVE AT ALL? I DON'T WANT TO BE A SKEPTIC, BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU AREN'T ABLE TO WALK TOMORROW? OKAY. WELL, GOOD LUCK. BLESS YOU. STEVE TOLD ME HE HEARD GOD TELL HIM TO COME TO MorningStar'S CONFERENCE, THAT THIS WOULD BE HIS MOMENT. STEVE HAS NO REASON TO BE A BELIEVER. HE HAS HAD A SERIES OF CATASTROPHIC ACCIDENTS THAT SEEM DEEPLY UNFAIR. FIRST, A CAR CRASH WHEN HE WAS 18 LEFT HIM WITH A BRAIN INJURY AND A SPEECH IMPEDIMENT. THEN, 15 YEARS AGO, HE FELL OFF A ROOF AND WAS PARALYZED IN HIS LOWER BODY. DOCTORS TOLD STEVE HE WOULD NEVER WALK AGAIN. Bentley: MEN AND WOMEN CAN WALK WITH GOD. Doctor: STEVEN HAD A TRAUMA, AND HE HAD FRACTURES OF HIS THORACIC THIRD, FOURTH, AND FIFTH VERTEBRAE, AND THE NERVES FROM THE LEVEL OF HIS INJURY DOWN DO NOT FUNCTION ANYMORE. THAT'S SOME HARDWARE THAT'S LEFT BEHIND. HE'S HAD THIS INJURY FOR A LONG TIME. THIS HAPPENED IN '95. YOU KNOW, THAT'S BEEN THAT WAY SINCE THE DAY OF HIS INJURY, AND HE'S HOPING TO GET SOME FUNCTION BACK. TAKE SOME DEEP BREATHS FOR ME. [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] ALL RIGHT, ONE MORE TIME. [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] HIS INJURIES -- ESSENTIALLY, YOU KNOW, HE'S LEFT PERMANENTLY WITH WHAT HE'S GOT AT THIS POINT. THERE'S NOT ANYTHING MEDICALLY THAT WE CAN REALLY OFFER HIM RIGHT NOW. YEAH, WELL, I'M NOT LOOKING... IF STEVE WALKED IN HERE, I'D BE SHOCKED, BUT I'D BE VERY HAPPY FOR HIM. BUT, YES, I'D BE VERY SHOCKED. I THINK THAT IF YOU HAVE FAITH, THAT YOU DO HEAL, AND IT CAN HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT. IF YOU LOSE FAITH, YOU CAN DEFINITELY DO WORSE. IT'S GOOD FOR HIM TO HAVE FAITH AND TO HAVE HOPE. Steve: WELL, UH, YOU KNOW... COME ON, BOSCOE. [ CLICKS TONGUE ] BOSCOE. [ BOSCOE BARKING ] Ling: STEVE FELTON COMES HERE WITH IMMENSE HOPES. BUT WOULD HE WALK? HIS JOURNEY TO THE MorningStar REVIVAL IS BOTH A TESTAMENT TO AND A TEST OF HIS FAITH... ...AND NOT JUST FOR HIM -- FOR THE THOUSANDS OF FOLLOWERS WHO CAME TO THIS HEALING CONFERENCE... AND FOR ME. [ UP-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS ] MorningStar MINISTRIES IS BIG. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ATTEND EVERY WEEK. THOUSANDS MORE WATCH ONLINE AND ON TV. MEGACHURCHES LIKE THIS ONE ARE PART OF A MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY WITH MILLIONS OF PARTICIPANTS AROUND THE WORLD. AND THEIR NUMBERS -- THE FAITHFUL -- ARE GROWING. [ INDISTINCT TALKING ] DEBBIE AND CHERI DROVE HERE FROM SAVANNAH, PAYING AROUND $600 EACH TO BE PART OF TODD BENTLEY'S REVIVAL. Woman: THANK YOU. I WAS ABOUT TO LEARN THAT THIS WAS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR THE MIRACLES THEY WERE HOPING FOR. HI. HOW ARE YOU? I'M LISA. I'M DEBBIE. HI, DEBBIE. I'M CHERI. HI, CHERI. NICE TO MEET YOU. CAN WE COME IN? SURE. COME ON IN. THANK YOU. Debbie: MY MOM IS TERMINALLY ILL, AND IT'S MY HEART'S DESIRE TO SEE HER HEALED. WHAT ARE HER AILMENTS? SHE HAS STAGE III VULVA CANCER. AT THIS POINT, THERE'S PROBABLY NO CURE, EXCEPT FOR THE LORD. DOES YOUR MOM HAVE INSURANCE? YES, SHE HAS MEDICARE, BUT NO SECONDARY INSURANCE. THAT WAS ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT CAUSED HER TO QUIT GETTING TREATMENT, BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT AFFORD THE THOUSANDS -- LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS' WORTH OF BILLS THAT WERE COMING IN. THAT TRULY DID HELP PROPEL HER TO JUST SEE GOD AS HER ONLY SOURCE AT THIS POINT. Ling: SO, IS SHE COMING UP FROM SAVANNAH TONIGHT? Cheri: TOMORROW NIGHT. TOMORROW NIGHT. MY HUSBAND'S GONNA MAKE IT WHERE SHE CAN LAY DOWN AND BRING HER FOR THE HEALING SERVICE. Bentley: YOU GUYS CAME FROM GEORGIA. Debbie: YES, SIR. SO, TELL ME WHY YOU'RE HERE. I CAME TO IGNITE INSIDE ME EVERYTHING I KNOW THAT'S THERE, BUT JUST IGNITE IT, TO ENGAGE MYSELF. THAT'S WHY I CAME. SO, YOU FEEL THE POWER IN THIS PLACE? OH, ABSOLUTELY. WHEN YOU'RE AROUND LIKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU BELIEVE, IT HELPS EMPOWER YOU TO HAVE MORE FAITH. JUST LIKE PROBABLY BEING AROUND US EVEN -- YOU AT LEAST, WHETHER YOU BELIEVE OR NOT, YOU GOT TO SEE, &quot;WOW, THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING GOING ON BECAUSE ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE KIND OF GETTING CHARGED UP.&quot; YOU'RE BEING BAPTIZED. I BELIEVE AND RECEIVE IT IN THE NAME OF JESUS! WHOO! BAM! [ Chanting ] BA! BA! BA! BA! BA! BA! BAM! BA! BA! BA! BAM! DEBBIE WAS RIGHT. THERE WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING GOING ON HERE. BUT WHAT? Bentley: RISE UP AND BE HEALED! BE HEALED! BE HEALED! BE HEALED OF CANCER. BE HEALED OF DIABETES. BE HEALED OF PARALYSIS. BE HEALED! CHARISMATIC PREACHERS LIKE TODD BENTLEY HAVE BEEN AROUND AS LONG AS THE BIBLE. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] AND WHILE TODD'S NOT THE ONLY 21st-CENTURY FAITH HEALER, HE IS QUITE POSSIBLY THE MOVEMENT'S MOST COMPELLING AND CONTROVERSIAL FIGURE. RISE UP! RISE UP! RISE UP! AND RISE UP AND SAY, &quot;DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE?&quot; Man: YES! I'M A SON OF THE KING. JUST WHO IS TODD BENTLEY, AND HOW DID HE BECOME, OF ALL THINGS, A FAITH HEALER? I WAS ABOUT TO LEARN HIS WAS AN UNLIKELY JOURNEY. I NAMED HER GRACIE. [ LAUGHS ] YOU NAMED YOUR CAR GRACIE? YEAH, GRACIE. LOOK AT HER. SHE'S BEAUTIFUL. YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED SOMETHING LOUD AND KIND OF LIKE MY PERSONALITY. NOT UNDERSTATED. [ LAUGHS ] TODD IS 34, DRIVES A SOUPED-UP TRUCK... [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] I HAVE A MATCHING MOTORCYCLE. ...AND IS ABOUT AS CLOSE TO A ROCK STAR AS THE PREACHING WORLD GETS. I LIKE HARD ROCK. I LIKE HEAVY MUSIC, YOU KNOW? I DON'T, YOU KNOW, FEAST ON, LIKE, SATANIC MUSIC. YOU KNOW, I DID, BUT I DON'T NOW. BUT I STILL LIKE THAT KIND OF BEAT, AND SO PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME. THEY GO, &quot;IS THAT CHRISTIAN?&quot; YOU KNOW? BUT THIS IS A MAN WITH A PAST WHO WALKED THROUGH FIRE TO REACH HIS FAITH. Ling: ARE THESE ALL LA-Z-BOYS? YEAH. YEAH. SO, WAIT -- ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE LA-Z-BOYS? HIS LIFE IS ALMOST CONVENTIONAL NOW -- A NICE HOME, NICE WIFE, NICE DOGS. BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS THIS WAY. YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T GROW UP IN A CHRISTIAN HOME AT ALL. I DIDN'T GROW UP WITH A CHRISTIAN BACKGROUND. I GREW UP AROUND BIKERS. I GREW UP AROUND SEX, DRUGS, AND ROCK 'N' ROLL. I GOT INVOLVED IN ALL KINDS OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. I WAS A THIEF. I WAS A LIAR. I ENDED UP ON THE STREET AT 17, LOST EVERYTHING, AND HAD MY THIRD OVERDOSE BY THAT TIME ALREADY ON DRUGS. MY FAMILY DIDN'T THINK I'D MAKE IT TILL I WAS 20. I DIDN'T CARE IF I MADE IT TILL I WAS 20. I MEAN, I HEARD -- GOD CALLED ME BY NAME. HE GAVE ME A CHOICE -- LIVE OR DIE. TODD CHOSE TO LIVE, IN A CHRISTIAN WAY. HE WAS BORN AGAIN, AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, HE DISCOVERED A GIFT. HE STARTED HONING HIS HEALING PRACTICE WITH YOUTH GROUPS, THEN SMALL MINISTRIES. AND BEFORE LONG, HE GOT FAMOUS, HE GOT MONEY, HE GOT FOLLOWERS. IN INDIA, 200,000 PEOPLE CAME TO HIS HEALINGS. I COMMAND EVERY TUMOR TO WITHER AND DIE IN THE NAME OF JESUS! IN AFRICA, SOUTH AMERICA, ALL OVER THE WORLD, REAL PEOPLE CLAIMED HE'D MADE THE BLIND SEE AND THE LAME WALK. BUT TODD'S FABLED RISE TOOK A TURN THAT IS LIKE SOMETHING RIGHT OUT OF THE BIBLE. TODD WAS ACCUSED OF ADULTERY, FOLLOWED BY A DIVORCE. IT'S NOT SOMETHING MOST OF US WOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT, BUT IN HIS WORLD, IT WAS A BIG DEAL -- ENOUGH TO FORCE HIM OFF THE PULPIT AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POWER. DO YOU SEE HOW SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK, &quot;DID HE DUPE US?&quot; BECAUSE HERE, HE'S -- OH, TOTALLY. HE'S ON THE SURFACE PREACHING THIS THING, AND THEN INSIDE... I, UH... THERE WERE THINGS I WISH I COULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY. I THINK GOD KIND OF SAID, &quot;YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA CRUSH YOU SO I CAN HEAL YOU.&quot; THE WHOLE WORLD SAW ME RISE. THE WHOLE WORLD SAW ME FALL. THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS I'M COMING BACK. THE BIBLE IS FULL OF STORIES OF REDEMPTION, OF GOD TAKING BROKEN PEOPLE AND USING THEM. TODD IS TRYING TO REBUILD HIS MINISTRY, AND MorningStar HAS OFFERED HIM THEIR STAGE TO DO IT. BUT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO'VE COME FOR HEALING, WHAT WILL THEY GET? SO MANY OF THESE PEOPLE -- THIS IS THEIR LAST HOPE. THEY'RE HERE WITH THE RAWNESS OF THEIR EMOTIONS AND THEIR HEARTS SHOWING, AND IT'S UP TO TODD TO DELIVER. [ MAN SINGING INDISTINCTLY ] ...OF THE ANOINTED. YEAH. THE SECOND DAY OF THE MorningStar CONFERENCE BRINGS EVEN MORE PEOPLE. THIS KIND OF PENTECOSTAL REVIVAL IS THE FASTEST-GROWING SEGMENT OF CHRISTIANITY IN THE WORLD. OH, GOD. [ SPEAKING IN TONGUES ] OR TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY, MORE AND MORE PEOPLE IN AMERICA ARE SPEAKING IN TONGUES. [ SPEAKING IN TONGUES ] THIS IS NOT JUST A CHURCH. THIS IS A MOVEMENT. [ SHOUTING ] AND JUST OFF THE MAIN PULPIT, ON THE SECOND NIGHT, I GET A GLIMPSE OF ITS DISCIPLES. WHOA! YES TO THIS HOUSE! WE WANT A TOUCH FROM YOU, LORD. ZACH WILCOX AND MORE THAN 100 OTHER STUDENTS LIVE, STUDY, AND WORK HERE AT MorningStar. THEY DON'T JUST BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF HEALING, THEY LIVE IT EVERY DAY. THEY CAN BE SEEN AT EVERY SERVICE, HELPING INVITE THE SPIRIT OF GOD INTO THE HOUSE, LIKE CHEERLEADERS. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] IT RUNS THROUGH THEM -- WHAT THEY CALL &quot;MANIFESTING.&quot; [ SHOUTING CONTINUES ] Ling: LET ME JUST ASK YOU, 'CAUSE FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T CHRISTIAN AND HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THAT, I MEAN, IT LOOKS KIND OF CRAZY, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? [ ALL SCREAMING ] Woman: IT IS CRAZY. IT IS CRAZY. I DIDN'T BELIEVE IN ANY OF THIS UNTIL I WENT THROUGH IT. I WAS LIKE, &quot;THAT PERSON'S CRAZY. THEY'RE SHAKING.&quot; AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, I'M THE ONE THAT'S DOING IT. CAN YOU KIND OF DESCRIBE WHAT YOU'RE FEELING WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THOSE KINDS OF SCENARIOS? Man: BREAKTHROUGH. Wilcox: I KNOW ON A PERSONAL LEVEL FOR ME IS A SENSE OF FREEDOM. LIKE, WE CAN HAVE SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR US THAT WE CAN TAP INTO TO GIVE US THAT FREEDOM. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] PEOPLE SAY THEY BELIEVE IN GOD, BUT THEY'RE NOT SURE ABOUT THE SUPERNATURAL. GOD IS SUPERNATURAL. HE'S NOT NATURAL. DO YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT, THROUGH THIS PRACTICE, PEOPLE CAN BE CURED OF CANCER OR OF TERMINAL DISEASES? YEP. YEAH. YEP. Man: SO, WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THESE HEALINGS IS WE'RE PUTTING OUR FAITH INTO EXPERIENCES THAT WE READ ABOUT IN THE BIBLE AND THEN EXPERIENCES THAT WE'RE HEARING AND NOW EXPERIENCING FOR OURSELVES. TODD AND HIS MOVEMENT ARE ACTUALLY NOT ANTI-DOCTORS, BUT THEY DO CLAIM THAT FAITH HEALING CAN DO SOME AMAZING, ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE THINGS. THANK YOU FOR NEW ANKLES. WOW! WATCHING IT, YOU CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER, &quot;IS THIS A SHAM, A DELUSION, OR SOMETHING THAT HAS REAL POWER?&quot; HERE WE GO. BAM! WHOA. THAT'S AWESOME. SO, TODD, I'M WATCHING YOU DO YOUR HEALING, AND YOU'RE LIKE, &quot;BAM! BAM! BAM!&quot; LIKE, WHAT'S THAT ABOUT? IT'S NOT THE WORD THAT REALLY IS DOING ANYTHING, BUT I DO FEEL RELEASES OF POWER WHEN I DO THAT. AT THAT MOMENT, BAM! THAT'S HOW I FOCUS ON RELEASING THE POWER OF GOD. IT'S THE POWER OF JESUS RELEASING THAT. ARE YOU A PROPHET, TODD? NO, I'M NOT A PROPHET. I CALL MYSELF JUST A NORMAL GUY THAT BELIEVES IN THE GIFTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, AND I'M TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON GOD'S SPIRIT. I'VE GOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE GOD HAS GIVEN ME A GIFT, AND I NEED TO USE THAT GIFT. I CAN HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD. IT'S A CLAIM NOT EVERYONE HERE BELIEVES. BUT I BECAME SO SPECTACULAR AT TIMES IN MY GIFT, IT WAS JUST THIS COMPETITION WITH MY OWN SELF. TODD, TRYING TO OVERCOME HIS PAST, REMAINS A CONTROVERSIAL FIGURE IN THE CHRISTIAN WORLD. BUT MY QUESTION IS... YOU PROPHESIZE TO YOURSELF? SEE YOU LATER. BYE. YOU'RE A FALSE PROPHET! WHAT ARE YOU? GOD BLESS YOU. ON THE SECOND NIGHT, A GROUP OF PROTESTORS, MEMBERS OF A CHRISTIAN ACTIVIST GROUP, INFILTRATES MorningStar. THEIR MESSAGE -- TODD BENTLEY IS NOT THE REAL DEAL. PEOPLE COME HERE SEEKING GOD, AND THEY HAVE FAITH THAT THEY'LL BE HEALED, BUT THE THING IS, THEY'RE GOING TO THE WRONG PERSON. A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE LOOKING AT TODD BENTLEY, HOPING THAT HE WILL HEAL THEM. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T GET HEALED. Bentley: COME ON, YOU GOT TO OWN IT. Ling: DO YOU BELIEVE TODD BENTLEY HAS HEALING POWERS? NO. WHAT HAS IT BEEN LIKE OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS AROUND ALL THESE PEOPLE AND ALL OF THIS FAITH? HAS IT HELPED YOU? YEAH. YEAH. FOR STEVE, THIS WAS NOT ABOUT TODD BENTLEY. HE HAD ONE MORE DAY BEFORE THE TIME GOD HAD PROMISED HIM HE WOULD WALK. AND I BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT I WAS SCARED FOR HIM. Ling: IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE SEEN ANYONE JUST WANT SOMETHING SO BADLY, AND NOT JUST WANT IT, BUT JUST BELIEVE. LIKE, THAT IS TRUE, TRUE FAITH. I BELIEVE STRONGLY IN FAITH. I JUST... I DON'T WANT TO SEE PEOPLE'S FAITH, HOPE MANIPULATED. EVERY TIME I LOOK IN HIS DIRECTION, I GET EMOTIONAL, AND I JUST HOPE HE'S NOT DISAPPOINTED. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WOULD DO TO HIS FAITH. [ GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS ] I'D BEGUN TO SEE THAT PART OF THE REASON THAT PEOPLE CAME HERE, PEOPLE LIKE STEVE, WAS TO BE AROUND THE LIKE-MINDED, TO LITERALLY FEEL THE COLLECTIVE POWER OF EACH OTHER'S FAITH. BUT MorningStar IS MORE THAN A VENUE FOR CHRISTIAN-ROCK-FUELED REVIVAL. IT IS ALSO, AT OTHER TIMES, A SCHOOL. Ling: THESE ARE THE STUDENTS OF MorningStar UNIVERSITY. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THEY ARE LEARNING HOW TO BECOME FAITH HEALERS. AND IT'S ONE THING TO DO IT WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THIS PLACE. IT'S ANOTHER TO TAKE WHAT THEY LEARNED OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY, WHICH IS WHAT THESE STUDENTS ARE PREPARING TO DO. TODD SAYS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO PREPARE AN ARMY OF FAITH HEALERS. TODAY, THE STUDENTS ARE ON A MISSION TO HEAL... ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS. ...A FAITH COURSE ON THE STREETS OF CHARLOTTE. CAN WE PRAY FOR YOU? WE WERE JUST WONDERING IF WE CAN PRAY FOR YOU. THAT'S OKAY? YEAH? IS THAT COOL? WE BELIEVE YOU CAN GET OUT OF THIS WHEELCHAIR AND WALK TODAY. WHAT GIVES ME THE POWER TO HEAL PEOPLE? JESUS CHRIST GIVES ME THE POWER TO HEAL PEOPLE. BY HIM BEING IN ME, THAT EMPOWERS ME TO BE ABLE TO DO THESE THINGS. WE SAY, &quot;RISE UP IN JESUS' NAME.&quot; ZACH, LIKE MANY OF THE STUDENTS, IS YOUNG, AMBITIOUS, GOOD-LOOKING. YOU GET THE FEELING HE COULD DO ANYTHING. DO YOU NEED ANY, LIKE, HEALING IN YOUR BODY OR ANYTHING? LIKE, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY HURT SPOTS ON YOUR BODY? I FEEL LIKE YOU MIGHT HAVE A BAD NECK. DOES YOUR NECK POP MUCH? IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU. AFTER PROLONGED DRUG USE AND A RUN-IN WITH THE LAW, HE CHOSE THIS... JESUS RAISED THE DEAD, NOW. ...TO BE A SOLDIER OF FAITH IN THIS MOVEMENT'S ARMY OF HEALERS. GRAB THAT BACK IN JESUS' NAME. PRAISE JESUS. COME ON. Wilcox: TODD WASN'T JUST THE ONLY ONE CREATED WITH THIS ABILITY. IT'S NOT TODD. IT'S THE POWER OF JESUS THAT IS INVESTED WITHIN HIS STOMACH, WITHIN HIS SPIRIT. Woman: YEAH. MM-HMM. Ling: HOW OLD ARE YOU? Wilcox: 20 YEARS OLD. OKAY. SO, YOU'RE 20 YEARS OLD, AND YOU'VE DEVOTED YOUR LIFE TO THIS. DON'T YOU KIND OF FEEL LIKE YOU'RE MISSING OUT A LITTLE BIT? I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT LEADING THE TYPICAL LIFE OF A 20-YEAR-OLD. NO, I'M NOT MISSING OUT AT ALL. THIS IS WHAT I WAS CREATED TO DO. HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S ALL LEGIT? LIKE, DO YOU EVER HAVE ANY DOUBTS ABOUT GOD? PEOPLE ALL HAVE DOUBTS, YEAH. A LOT OF PEOPLE DOUBT. THE SPIRIT OF DOUBT WILL TRY TO CREEP UP ON YOU AND SAY THAT IT'S NOT REAL. AND THE ENEMY WILL TRY TO TELL YOU THAT IT'S ALL FAKE. BUT I KNOW HE'S REAL. I'VE EXPERIENCED HIM. LIKE, I'VE BEEN TO HEAVEN. LIKE, I'VE BEEN THERE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU WENT TO HEAVEN? I CAN'T -- THERE'S NO WAY TO EXPLAIN, YOU KNOW, HOW I GOT THERE, HOW I KNEW I WAS THERE. I JUST KNEW IT. THERE'S THESE GOLDEN CURTAINS, THERE WAS THIS GOLDEN TABLE, AND THIS GOLDEN STAIRWAY WAS... WERE YOU ON DRUGS? [ Laughing ] NO, I WASN'T ON DRUGS. I JUST KNEW. I JUST KNEW THAT'S WHERE I WAS AT. COOL. YEAH. ONE BY ONE, I GOT TO KNOW THESE STUDENTS AND FOUND OUT THAT, LIKE ZACH, LIKE TODD, THEY EACH HAD A STORY. THEY EACH KNEW EXACTLY WHAT BROUGHT THEM HERE -- ADDICTION, ABUSE, DEPRESSION, SEVERE TEENAGE ANGST. THE WORLD HAD BEEN HARD ON MANY OF THEM, AND THIS WAS THEIR PATH OUT. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] FOR ONE OF THE STUDENTS, SARAH, IT WAS LITERALLY A LIFESAVER. Sarah: I RAN FROM GOD, AND I ENDED UP LIVING WITH A GUY WHO WOULD ABUSE ME AND HE WOULD BEAT ME. AND EVENTUALLY HE FRACTURED MY SKULL, AND THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED, LIKE, &quot;GOD, WHAT IS THERE FOR ME?&quot; [ SOBBING ] [ Voice breaking ] I WOULD WALK OUT OF MY HOUSE, AND I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WALK OUT AT NIGHT. I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME GOD TOLD ME TO WALK OUT AT NIGHT AND TAKE A WALK IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD, I CRIED, I WAS SO SCARED. AND NOW I CAN BE FREE AND I CAN BE HAPPY, AND I'M NOT SCARED PEOPLE ARE GONNA HURT ME. Bentley: YOU CAN FEEL -- IT'S ALMOST LIKE AN ANGEL MINISTERING HERE. WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW? RIGHT NOW? A HAND. IS IT BURNING OR JUST A HAND? I JUST FEEL IT. DO YOU THINK IT'S JESUS? [ SIGHS HAPPILY ] YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] BOOM! BA! FINISH IT, LORD. WHOO! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! [ SQUEALING ] BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! POW! YOU GUYS PROBABLY HAVE LOTS OF CLIPS OF ME LAUGHING. I COULDN'T LAUGH A YEAR AGO. I CAN'T STOP NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHING ] SARAH MADE ME SEE SOMETHING NEW. HER EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL PAIN HAD BEEN EASED BY COMING HERE. THE HEALING SHE FELT -- IT WAS IN THE STRENGTH TO HOPE AGAIN. [ LAUGHING ] THIS IS WHAT GAVE HER -- OR ZACH -- THE BELIEF THAT THEY COULD HEAL OTHERS. BUT WHAT ABOUT STEVE OR DEBBIE AND CHERI? THEY CAME HERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST HOPE. THEY CAME FOR AN ALL-OUT MIRACLE, AND THERE WAS JUST ONE MORE DAY FOR IT TO HAPPEN. OUR FATHER, WHO IS IN HEAVEN... ON THE FINAL DAY OF THE CONFERENCE, EVERYONE IS FOCUSED ON THEIR HOPES, READYING, PREPARING FOR MIRACLES. GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD, AND FORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSES, AS WE FORGIVE THOSE WHO TRESPASS AGAINST US. Bentley: I FEEL HEALTHIER THAN I'VE EVER BEEN. I FEEL STRONGER THAN I'VE EVER BEEN. I FEEL I'M READY AGAIN. IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING THAT I'VE EVER TAUGHT AND PREACHED THAT WAS REAL IS ALIVE AND MORE REAL NOW. I REALIZED WHEN IT WAS ALL GONE FROM ME AND I WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP AND ALL THE WAY BACK DOWN TO THE BOTTOM, I'LL NEVER BE ASHAMED OR HIDE FROM MY PAST. I'LL USE IT TO MAKE ME STRONGER, TO GIVE HOPE. FOR DEBBIE, CHERI, AND THEIR MOTHER, CAROL, THIS CONFERENCE IS THEIR ATTEMPT TO CURE THEIR MOTHER OF CANCER. CAROL HAS ARRIVED. THEY RAN OUT OF MONEY FOR CHEMOTHERAPY AND HAVE NOW PLACED THEIR MOTHER'S HEALTH IN GOD'S HANDS. MOM, ISWEETIE.LY COLD, YEAH. ALL RIGHT, GRAB HER COAT, BILL. GET SITUATED IN YOUR BEARINGS, OKAY? Debbie: I REALLY BELIEVE GOD'S GOT A GREAT PLAN, AND I BELIEVE MY MOM -- I DON'T THINK HER TIME -- IT'S NOT HER TIME. WHEN IT IS, SHE'LL KNOW. I JUST KNOW THAT SHE'S GONNA BE HEALED AS SOON AS SHE WALKS IN THIS PLACE. ABSOLUTELY. TOTALLY. I WANT PEOPLE TO REALIZE THIS ISN'T A PHONY THING. THIS IS REAL. AS REAL AS ANYTHING TANGIBLE. WHEN YOU GO TO SIT IN A CHAIR, YOU DON'T QUESTION WHETHER IT'S GONNA HOLD YOU. YOU JUST GO AND SIT IN THAT CHAIR. WITH THE FAITH, KNOWING IT'S NOT GONNA FALL. STEVE FELTON, TOO, HAS BEEN WAITING FOR TONIGHT EXPECTANTLY. GOD TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD WALK IN THE LAST 10 MINUTES OF THE LAST SERVICE. SO, I'VE SEEN YOU SITTING IN THE HALLWAY EVERY SINGLE DAY, AND TONIGHT IS THE VERY LAST NIGHT. YEAH. SPECIFICALLY, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HAPPEN TONIGHT? [ LAUGHS ] TODD'S SERMON TONIGHT, HIS MESSAGE ON THE FINAL NIGHT, IS ALL ABOUT DOUBT. IF YOU HAVE IT, HE SAYS, YOU MIGHT NOT GET HEALED. YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S AN ACTUAL DEMON CALLED &quot;UNBELIEF&quot;? IT COULD BE THE DEVIL'S STRONGEST DEVIL. PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS ASKED ME, &quot;WHY ARE THE MIRACLES GREATER IN INDIA AND AFRICA AND MEXICO -- IN THIRD-WORLD COUNTRIES?&quot; HUNGER, DESPERATION, BELIEF. CAN WE SEE IT HERE? [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] I WANTED TO BELIEVE IN TODD AS MUCH AS EVERYONE, AS MUCH AS DEBBIE AND HER MOM, OR STEVE. Bentley: COME ON, WE'RE CHANGING SPIRITUAL CLIMATES. WE'RE CHANGING ATMOSPHERES. FOR THREE DAYS, TODD HAS PREACHED THE GOSPEL FROM THIS PULPIT. FOR THREE DAYS, THE FAITHFUL HAVE GATHERED AND LISTENED. FOR THREE DAYS, TODD HAS PROMISED THEM MIRACLES. STEVE FELTON'S APPOINTED TIME WITH HIS HEALER WAS FAST APPROACHING. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, I ALLOW MYSELF TO HOPE. IF YOU BELIEVED IT STRONGLY ENOUGH, COULD YOU ACTUALLY BE HEALED? Bentley: IF YOU HAVE A TERMINAL ILLNESS OR YOU'VE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER, WE WANT TO PRAY FOR YOU FIRST HERE TO THE LEFT OF THE STAGE. IN THE LAST HOUR OF THE CONFERENCE, TODD PREPARES FOR WHAT THEY CALL A HEALING LINE. THE FLOOR IS ARRANGED BY CATEGORY -- BACK PAIN OVER HERE, CANCER AND TERMINAL DISEASE OVER THERE, AND SO ON. TODD WILL LAY HANDS ON NOT JUST ONE OR TWO FAITHFUL, BUT ON EVERYONE. Bentley: SO, YOU READY TO GET SOME? YEAH? SAY, &quot;GOD, I'M READY TO GET SOME TONIGHT. COME AND MEET ME, GOD.&quot; AS WE TOUCH HEAVEN, I WANT YOU TO BE FOCUSED ON ONE THING -- RECEIVING. BAM! BAM! BAM! WE'RE COMING DOWN THE LINE. Woman: SO WON'T YOU COME COME LIKE YOU PROMISED? POUR OUT YOUR SPIRIT... AS TODD COMES DOWN THE LINE AND DRAWS NEARER TO CAROL, DEBBIE, AND CHERI AND TO STEVE, I REALIZE THERE'S NO PLACE FOR DOUBT HERE IN THIS ROOM. ...POUR OUT YOUR SPIRIT POUR OUT YOUR SPIRIT... WHOO! CAROL IS LITERALLY SHAKING WITH EXPECTATION. HER VERY LIFE IS ON THE LINE. AND STEVE -- STEVE HAS ENTERED A DIFFERENT STATE. IT'S THE LAST 10 MINUTES OF THE LAST NIGHT -- THE TIME HE BELIEVES HE WILL WALK AGAIN. ...POWER, POWER, POWER, POWER, POWER, POWER, POWER, POWER, POWER, POWER... POWER, POWER, POWER, POWER, POWER, POWER, POWER. Ling: STEVE IS FEELING IT. LIKE, HE IS IN THE ZONE. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO BE NEAR HIM BECAUSE THIS IS THE MOMENT THAT HE HAS BEEN WAITING FOR FOR 15 YEARS. I AM JUST PRAYING REALLY, REALLY HARD RIGHT NOW. FOR THREE DAYS, I WONDERED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE PROMISED MIRACLES DIDN'T APPEAR. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO CAROL AND DEBBIE AND CHERI? WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS WHO HAD COME HERE SEEKING HEALING? AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO STEVE, WHO KNEW BEYOND DOUBT THAT TONIGHT WAS HIS NIGHT? STEVE, SITTING IN THAT WHEELCHAIR, WHO COULD HAVE BEEN REALLY DEVASTATED BY THE FACT THAT HE DIDN'T WALK ON THE NIGHT THAT HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO WALK, BUT THEN HE TRANSFERRED THAT ENERGY TO ME IMMEDIATELY. THAT WAS AMAZING. AS STEVE LAID HIS HANDS ON ME, I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING FOR THE FIRST TIME. MAYBE I WAS THE ONE THAT WAS EXPECTING TOO MUCH. Ling: WHAT ARE YOU HOPING THAT WE TAKE AWAY FROM THIS EXPERIENCE -- PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING THIS? WHO ARE WATCHING THIS? YEAH. I HOPE THEY TAKE AWAY AN OPENNESS, BECAUSE RELIGION DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS, JUST SOMETIMES LIKE MEDICINE DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS. I'D HOPE PEOPLE WOULD WALK AWAY WITH FAITH AND AN OPENNESS TO SAY, &quot;HEY, IF YOU'RE REAL, GOD, &quot;COME AND MEET ME IN MY CIRCUMSTANCE AND HELP ME IN MY LIFE.&quot; THE BIBLE SAYS, &quot;HOPE DEFERRED MAKES THE HEART SICK.&quot; WHEN PEOPLE DON'T HAVE HOPE, THEY GET SICK, THEY GET DISCOURAGED. PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW NO MATTER HOW DARK AND HOW MUCH THEY'VE FALLEN, YOU CAN ALWAYS START OVER AGAIN. YOU CAN ALWAYS GET UP AGAIN. YOU CAN ALWAYS MOVE FORWARD. THE CONCLUSIONS HERE WERE, FOR ME, NOT EASY ONES. TODD'S ROAD TO A COMEBACK STILL SEEMED BUILT ON A TENUOUS PROMISE OF MIRACLES, NO MATTER HOW SINCERE. CAROL, WHOM I NEVER DID GET TO SEE AGAIN, WENT BACK TO GEORGIA. WHEN WE LAST SPOKE, DEBBIE AND CHERI TOLD ME HER CANCER HAD STEADILY BEEN GETTING WORSE. BUT I DID LEARN SOMETHING UNEXPECTED HERE. LIVES COULD BE GENUINELY CHANGED, HOPE COULD TRANSFORM, AND FAITH COULD EMPOWER. Sarah: A YEAR AGO TO THIS DAY, I ALMOST DIED. LIKE, I WAS GETTING ABUSED AND BEATEN, AND THAT'S WHEN IT HIT ME. AND THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED THAT GREATER IS GOD WHO IS IN ME, THAN THE PERSON THAT WAS TRYING TO KILL ME. AND IT HEALED ME. MAYBE FAITH WAS ITS OWN REWARD. THIS IS JUST A BRIEF PERIOD... Ling: I CAME INTO THIS WITH A VERY PRECONCEIVED IDEA OF WHAT IT WAS GOING TO BE AND THAT THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF MANIPULATION AND FALSE HOPE, AND I HAVE... I'M LEAVING HERE THINKING THAT I DON'T THINK THERE'S A SUCH THING AS FALSE HOPE.
