[Jean Lee] Thursday April 13th, 2023. It's just before 8am, and across the northern Japanese island of ready for work, and bundling their kids off to [SFX: Siren] [Geoff White] Loudspeakers in the streets play [JL] Trains screech to a halt, alerts blare from [SFX: Recorded message in Japanese] [GW] They're telling people to stay inside or get to to watch out for debris falling from the sky. [JL] The source of the panic is a ballistic missile launched just moments before from North [GW] Kim Jong-un is carrying out [JL] Minutes later, the alerts stop. The danger has in the sea between North Korea and Japan. No-one [GW] But for many people in Japan, this incident is yet another terrifying reminder [Clip: North Korean news report] [GW] Meanwhile, back in North Korea, [Clip: North Korean news report] [JL] North Korean State TV broadcast blazing into the sky in a cloud of the launch site, this time with his It was an inter-continental ballistic missile built to reach can be launched faster, with greater stealth, Despite the ever-tightening squeeze borders due to the Covid pandemic, North bigger, more powerful weapons. [GW] Weapons that from all over the world that North Korea And it's here that all those cyber crimes we've [JL] South Korean analysts say North Korea out missile tests in 2022 alone, and US officials Korea spends on weapons comes from cybercrime. [GW] The hackers are paying the bills, in part at least. Each new cyber heist feeds the government's coffers, and Throughout this series, we've seen time and again how hard [JL] The hackers haven't been stopped from stealing all the cash. spending it, and pushing forward with his plan to [Music] From the BBC World Service, this is Jean Lee, and I'm Geoff White. Episode 9: Big Spenders. [Brass band music] [JL] I'll never forget the first time I watched a you're dazzled by the synchronicity of thousands And I was standing right on the plaza, so close the intensity of their gazes. When a 70-foot-long barrelling toward you, it's honestly terrifying, and designed to destroy me and my country. And that Kim Jong-un wants to present to the world, and to invite foreign photographers and TV Crews, so All North Korea watchers have and since the country closed its borders live feeds of North Korean TV online. And I'm social media among weapons experts who are nerding They're always looking for clues to figure out And one of my favourite self-described North Korea [Melissa Hanham] It is my favourite. We get together in groups to have watching parties, and and look at what they're gonna show you. [JL] Melissa is Korea's weapons of mass destruction. If Melissa can that North Korea needs, that's the first step money on getting hold of it. [GW] But finding this stuff public outing when they're paraded or tested, North manage to build them. [JL] That's exactly what Melissa a China analyst, when North Korea tested its first It left the world wondering how on Earth this tiny, and Melissa was captivated by the challenge of [Melissa Hanham] It was a mysterious Black Box. I couldn't go there, I couldn't I couldn't do anything that you would scientific investigation of what was happening. [JL] To solve this puzzle, Melissa has a superpower. using publicly available information to carry out [GW] It's amazing what she can suss out. Here's an example of a puzzle was working with at the time managed to solve, starts with Melissa watching one of North Korea's not the monster missiles she's looking at. It's In this case, she's also looking at what's under [MH] I remember the day where they rolled were freaking out about this huge missile on top. [GW] These vehicles really are enormous. They look I gave her too much chunky Lego: she likes wheels. isn't a toy. These trucks are a vital part of North of building an inter-continental missile if you [MH] These things are massive, so we take that into our calculation So we start looking for roads that have really you want a parallel-park an 11-axle track in [JL] Knowing the constraints of these vehicles, Melissa can parade, just by looking at satellite imagery of the [GW] And that's an important clue in being able to figure out where North Korea the missiles mounted on top of them. Information [JL] She and her colleagues have been State TV. They're looking out for any [MH] They were showing us these propaganda videos, these shouting and, you know, this kind of thing, but we [JL] And they spot a few seconds of footage showing off the missiles [MH] There was this short video clip, it was 13 seconds long, in a movie of this building. And my boss at the time said: I didn't think it was possible to find a building [GW] Still, Melissa decides to give it a try. know roughly how big the trucks are and figures of the warehouse they're storing them in. [MH] I said, well, I can make a 3D-model of the building using the vehicles that were inside of the building the building was, and everywhere that there were inside of the building, you can probably see the no way you're going to be able to find it in North Korea. [GW] But Melissa notices that the windows in the warehouse have a particular pattern to them. And, images, her team spot a match. A building big enough pattern of windows. [JL] She can now say with a high in Kim Jong-un's weapons programme, something [MH] Nuclear programmes are the most secret, most closely lady that's never even set foot in North Korea, and [JL] So these monster trucks play a role in helping Melissa find out where North reason Melissa has become kind of obsessed with them. [GW] They're also one of the most desired items on the country's weapons of mass destruction [MH] So these vehicles are precious, in some ways more precious than the missile itself, are more complicated, they have more components, you drive some of those axles, and they have like North Korea to build these indigenously, but it is would rather try to illicitly procure them from overseas. [JL] This is where the Lazarus Group money comes in. These trucks are one key item that North alleged hacks. From the Bangladesh Bank job to Bank [GW] But because of UN sanctions, North Korea can't just call up the in army green, please. Instead, they're looking for [MH] These are commercial vehicles, everything from anything with a really heavy duty chassis can be a missile launcher, or parts of it can be. That dual-use items. [JL] Dual-use items: Items that have a or oil tankers, that could also have a military vehicles and rigging them up to be mobile missile [GW] And the sanctions that are designed to stop this, they're far from foolproof. [MH] Sometimes we equipment, and buying them used means that the that the equipment they're selling could have a [GW] I guess that makes sense; if you're selling suspect the person you're selling it to is going Melissa discovered that the chassis for the are made in China. She says the Chinese company seller didn't realise the eventual buyer was [JL] And this highlights what the world is up against, because many of the dual-use items, and that's not just true for its accused of manufacturing biological weapons. [MH] So the really rough part is, if you're making a biological weapons programme, you need a lot of would need for medicine, you would need for making baby baby food. But you can also use it to make anthrax. [JL] So, I used to bring in baby food. I was like, what can like, OK, don't... you know, don't arrest me, but... [MH] No, no, no you would... So processed, You can bring all of that in that you want. bring in spray dryers. So if you're going to make and this takes the various nutrients that you've into a powder form. But if you're making anthrax, spray dryer than you would necessarily [JL] It was Melissa who first revealed evidence of a as a pesticide plant, back in 2015. North Korea invited, quote: &quot;America's imbecile secretaries [GW] But several experts agree with Melissa's findings and, worse still, Melissa believes that North Korea the incredibly dangerous task of manufacturing basic machines, the kind used for baby food, because [MH] What we learned in North Korea is that they were willing to use less you know, if you were in the United States, or I'd never let people around that thing, that's too just soldier on. [JL] North Korean workers are expected This story should remind us that the victims of the banks and cryptocurrency companies they steal Koreans forced to work in unsafe conditions, many lives to build weapons for their ambitious, [GW] And one of the cruelest parts of this is that some of the items probably think they're helping the North truck for fighting fires, or a machine for making [JL] Plus, they probably have no idea they're being paid with the proceeds of has strongly denied carrying out cyber attacks and [GW] To pull off these procurement deals to buy the kit they eyes of the people selling to them, like they did truck. But how exactly do they do that? [JL] Well, just as North Korea seems to hacking, stealing, and laundering money, they've also business deals. We're about to meet a man who network. It's a murky world of diplomatic passports [JL] It's July 2014, and in a coffee shop in is waiting for a rendezvous with a [John Park] One of the things that I expected was that he almost a uniform type of boxy, North Korean suit, all of those things, I expected some variation on [JL] This is John Park. He's director of the Korea project at the Belfer Center at Harvard. In pairs his finance background with his research business dealings. He's come to Seoul to meet with [GW] John doesn't want to tell us this defector's real him Mr Kim. And that's because Mr Kim knows things, [JL] So, Mr Kim is taking a risk with this meeting, all what John was expecting. [JP] So the first thing appearance. Immaculate tailored suit from his in very polished English with a British accent, very similar to an expat business person that you in any part of Asia. [JL] Before he defected, Mr Kim former North Korean Diplomat we heard from in a given diplomatic credentials that allowed him to [GW] But whereas Mr Ryu says he was working on Mr Kim was working on the import side: getting hold of [JP] Pyongyang and headquarters would send him a particular item to procure. benign, a luxury item, in some cases on a sanctions would be something very specialised that would be the North Korean side. Like, it was up to him how to [GW] Part of John's work as an academic researcher to North Korea's weapons development are working. government and the UN in designing more effective [JL] There's something John finds puzzling. Over his career, he's seen sanctions on Those sanctions should have helped slow down but that's not what's been happening. In fact, it's their capability increases. [GW] The sanctions, it seems, big military displays, where North Korea shows Melissa obsessed over. [JL] The question is, why aren't plan to find out. He teams up with another analyst defector community. They're looking for anyone who Korea's weapons programme. [GW] And that's how John comes Korean diplomat. He'd be attached to a consulate or [JL] Mr Kim specialised in the kinds of sanctions-evading I've met men like Mr Kim in Pyongyang myself. businessmen, working in Africa, China and elsewhere always confused me, until of course I got to know [GW] Whatever the regime wanted, Mr Kim would find a way [JP] The example that Mr Kim provided was essentially medical equipment. This is [JL] Dual-use items again. This time, a medical imaging this case made by a company in Japan. The North machine itself. They're more interested in what's used in weapons manufacturing. [GW] Because of that machine is tightly controlled. To buy one, you've machine is going to be put to its proper use. [JL] How does Mr Kim get around this? Well, he's spent years cultivating relationships with several legitimate buy the machine on his behalf, and in the paperwork approved, job done. [GW] Well, not quite. After the inspector might be sent to visit the hospital to Mr Kim's thought of that. [JP] What ends up happening is user, there's something of a paper chase where the medical equipment is being used, by a network of chasing down this item that long ago had made its [GW] In other words, they get the run around. [JL] As they finish their coffees, John slides how he was making these kinds of trades, and the showing all the different companies and middlemen needed, from a commercial supplier all the way to [GW] This is a revelation for John, because that piece Korea's sanctions evasion has become. [JL] North Korean It would send one person abroad on a business trip There was no time to learn how to do business. [GW] He was stationed overseas for years, and not just with criminal wheeler dealers, but also channel his transactions through. [JL] Let's take contact in a commercial shipping company and the busiest shipping routes and ports, where And John says Mr Kim isn't the only procurement John and his colleagues spoke to a dozen others, [JP] The picture that emerges is of North Korea Incorporated. that does business in the marketplace like You know, even individuals from the North Korea Inc which some of these items would go back, because parts of China and the mainland. It becomes a hiding in the open. [GW] North Korea Incorporated. It's that picture. They're a vital part of the whole once they do, it becomes part of this much bigger [JL] John has one more question for Mr Kim. If sanctions are getting tougher why aren't Initially, when tougher sanctions started to Some of his business associates in China knew their distance from him. [GW] Mr Kim was sweating. in Pyongyang, no ifs, no buts. [JL] But to his surprise, [JP] There were other types of local business partners who sought out people like Mr Kim because they particular type of procurement transaction for Mr fee, and because Mr Kim had the ability to finance negative consequence of increasing sophisticated innovation in the marketplace. [GW] In other words, the overseas accomplices could charge for being the [JL] Over time, Mr Kim came to love sanctions. The contacts approaching him in search of that him things he hadn't even dreamed of before. [JP] It's that phenomenon that I think has led to increasing sanctions not slowing down the North Korean WMD these very entrepreneurial and creative ways to There is a medical analogy. It looked very and as more effective antibiotics were applied do see some of these North Korean companies being some instances it kind of looked like a superbug [GW] John says this isn't to say sanctions don't work at all; Mr Kim did lose some better off after the sanctions were applied. [JP] The counterfactual of this is, if we didn't have the increasing application of sanctions entities would be doing business transaction importantly, with less capable local Chinese more difficult for them to procure some of these [JL] What we do know is that the North Koreans are experience getting around sanctions. They know that and it's almost as though they anticipate what step ahead. And that means relying on hackers We mentioned earlier that Mr Kim was taking a insider secrets. Well, John came to understand that One that he kept coming back to again and again. He rings around your sanctions, and you're still not [GW] Underestimating North Korea. That's certainly one of the themes of this podcast, right? [JL] Absolutely. And it's a message I've tried to get across with all my work on North Korea. So I Korea's struggling economy and think, how could The world may have mocked Kim Jong-un when ambitious young man on a single-minded mission standing, by all means necessary. This regime is far giving it credit for. [GW] This kind of thinking may Take the nuclear issue. For years, North Korea mount a powerful nuclear bomb on a missile capable took that claim with a pinch of salt. [JL] But Melissa Hanham, that open source says it may already be too late to stop them. [MH] North Korea is nothing if it is not creative, clever, agile. It's so much more difficult to equipment. They'd constantly change their plan, it's a losing battle. I think the prime time for [GW] In fact, Melissa says North Korea may already nuclear missile. But the only way she us can know for sure, is if Kim Jong-un [MH] But holy moly, that's... that would be terrifying. I mean, that would be [JL] I don't believe Kim Jong-un wants to use these claimed that he has the right to do so. He's not North Korea as well. [GW] What keeps people like tests could spark one of the world's leaders [MH] I think we have to be confident in our leadership to keep will not overreact, and will not miscalculate. I an elected official who wants to throw caution to [JL] Kim Jong-un isn't done. He's going to keep trying to improve his arsenal, to make it more harder for his adversaries to defend against. Two weapons that he wanted to perfect. Hypersonic and he's been ticking off that list, one by one. [GW] And a big chunk of the funding for that work is coming from the hacks we've covered in since we launched this season, and the ones we [JL] What's fascinating is that arguably North Korea's most powerful weapon, the this team of young men trained from boyhood to [GW] Who exactly these men are remains a mystery to shadowy Bobby Sierra, it's been impossible for [JL] Right. So we want to close out by introducing you to someone who has Someone who's followed them so closely that His name is Simon Choi. I met him at his Simon is a young cyber security researcher. As morphed into a fascination with hacking. ended up doing his compulsory military He continued working in cyber well respected in his field that South Korea's In a way, he's leading a parallel life to the DMZ. Simon is also a trained hacker. He honed his that training to defend against North Korea. He's - Explain to me what this is, what are we looking at? It looks [JL] Simon pulls out a laptop and turns it around to show me something. inside of a North Korean hacker's PC. He used that [Simon explaining in Korean] [JL] Ah, these are targets, the names of the people and [Simon Choi] What they would do is get the email addresses and embed malicious code into Then the hackers would steal information from the without resting. And I thought, this is just very thing that you can't do unless you're being forced [JL] On a screen, I can see a list of email addresses, and telephone numbers, hacker's next targets. - Oh my gosh! One of... oh, I hope know on this list, including someone who we had on [JL] The people on this list are North Korea experts, politicians, academics, and diplomats. It's included in the first season of The Lazarus Heist. I get phishing emails from suspected North Korean [GW] We wanted to speak to Simon because he says he's found a way to talk to North clever trick called a honey trap. In the old-school attractive spy who'd use their romantic charms to cyber version, which let's be honest is a bit less so it looked like it belonged to a person or would be interested in targeting. Sure enough, the [JL] Once they were inside his machine, Simon had a way of typing messages even amused that they'd been tricked this way, [SC] They did respond, and I realised that they speak And they responded: &quot;Yes, I am.&quot; And the person responded: &quot;You're also I've been studying this for over 10 years, out about their identities, so moments [JL] When he tries the same honey trap method [SC] I encountered a North Korean hacker who was They said: &quot;Europe&quot;. And then all of a sudden, the hacker same question: &quot;How about you, how much do you get [JL] This hacker probably has minders watching his every And the thing he wants to know the most, the is how much does Simon get paid? Perhaps what he's I'd been born on the other side of the Korean DMZ, [GW] You can just imagine him looking up from his keyboard, glancing around with a bunch of other guys, all working punishingly are my hours worth? What am I worth? Maybe I could [JL] Just as we are curious about them, these hackers of curiosity that has provided the spark for so [GW] We just can't know. But one thing's for sure. The Lazarus Group hackers live, how we bank, how we think, what phishing emails This is perhaps their greatest power, and heists we've covered throughout this series. [JL] And that makes all of us incredibly vulnerable.
