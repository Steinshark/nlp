MATTHEW: First event is the basketball race. Colin, your time begins in 3, 2, 1 . . . go! MATTHEW: Okay, he has to do a lay up, free throw, and three pointer. MATTHEW: Oh boy, he makes the free throw. Three-pointer and your time stops. Can he Oh my! What was his time? TOMMY: 11.14 How? There is absolutely zero chance I will beat MATTHEW: 2, 1, go.

Gold to, somehow, the second youngest. MATTHEW: Next event is the 40 yard dash and bottle flip. Fastest three times get medals. Colin's up first because he won the last event. MATTHEW: Colin, your time begins in three two, one, go! MATTHEW: He's booking it. He's booking it. Guys, the hard part is the cap flip, though. Let's see, this is really tough because it's windy today. MAGGIE: And it's a small little table. MATTHEW: Oh boy. What's the time? TOMMY: 17.84 ISABEL: It's going to take me seventeen seconds to just run to the cap flip. What is he doing? Guys, look at all the fans over there? Go! MATTHEW: He's here in 5 seconds. TOMMY: He's a lion. Go Izzy! TOMMY: I want gold. She missed the whole table. Have a couple tries. TOMMY: Yes! Time? MATTHEW: 14 seconds. There we go. What did I get? TOMMY: 17.31 MATTHEW: What did Colin get? TOMMY: I don't know what Colin got. COLIN: I got 17.21. MATTHEW: No! MATTHEW: Wait, let's check the screenshot. TOMMY: We're checking the screenshot. No it was 17. 84. TOMMY: Wait, MATTHEW: Let's go, we're in sec. [sad music] The third place goes to Colin, AKA C-Cash. MATTHEW: By less Second place, is Matty-G. MATTHEW: That's not my name, but I'll take it. First place somehow goes to Tommy. TOMMY: Thank you, thank you everybody. Look at these things. For the third event, we have three balloons: a gold, silver, and bronze, whichever the medal you get. And the three people with no medals ISABEL: What? How did that happen? MATTHEW: What a pass! [cheering] MATTHEW: Owen gets silver. [Music] MATTHEW: Oh my! She touched that thing. [record scratch] TOMMY: What is in those woods? MAGGIE: That balloon was so beat up by me that MATTHEW: Now we only have the gold medal remaining. TOMMY: That's kind of fun. MATTHEW: Oh, no way! Colin gets the gold. Third place goes to Isabel--congratulations. ISABEL: Thank you. The silver medal goes to Owen, his first medal of the day. Congratulations. And gold goes to the last person who popped the balloon--Colin. And he is now the The fourth event is soccer bocce ball. The three closest kicks to that target ball over there will win medals. Since Colin is in first place, he has to go first so he doesn't know what he has to beat. Oh! Wait. MATTHEW: That was good. That was good. I think that will get a medal. I'm in second place, so I'm going next. The wind is going that way. [cheering] MATTHEW: That was good. TOMMY: I don't think I have the win, though. MATTHEW: How am I going to beat that? I think I'm going to play the roll here. Not really try to get much elevation, but just have a clean pass and roll it down the hill. MATTHEW: Shoot. No, it went to the left. That was really bad. TOMMY: Good kick. MATTHEW: That might beat me. COLIN: Owen and Matthew are close. MATTHEW: Hit mine closer! That might be second. We might have to measure this out. TOMMY: Maggie, kick it hard. MATTHEW: Maggie, you're last. TOMMY: And go. MATTHEW: That's good! TOMMY: What a shot! MAGGIE: Let's go! MATTHEW: That might be first. That might be first. TOMMY: It's between me and Maggie. Here at the Colin Amazing Olympics, we measure with my body. MATTHEW: Next body, next body. Who's next? MAGGIE: We could just use feet. TOMMY: You are one Matthew, one Owen . . . and one arm length. MATTHEW: Let's see Maggie. This is closer. This one is closer. Maggie wins! And Isabel took third, guys. ISABEL: Thank you, thank you. MATTHEW: This is getting intense. This is Isabel's second Maggie, your first medal and it's gold! There you go. And Tommy with his third. COLIN: Me and Tommy are tied. MATTHEW: For the next event we are doing badminton. The first three people to hit a birdie into this square win medals. Isabel and Owen, you're first 'cause you have the least amount of points. MATTHEW: Let's see if you can do it. I'm going to go with the overhand approach. It might terribly fail. MATTHEW: Woah, Iike it. Despite Isabel's poor chance right there, I'm going to do overhand too. Back in my day, I was pretty lethal in badminton in gym class. MATTHEW: He got it on the roof again. We only have one more birdie. MATTHEW: Don't lose it, guys. TOMMY: I have a feeling &quot;built different&quot; Matthew is doing something. He told me to take the camera and didn't explain. MAGGIE: I want Good job, Matthew, getting the badminton for us. MATTHEW: Do I get a medal for this? TOMMY: Yeah, you get the one that comes after bronze. I don't know what that one is. TOMMY: That guy is built different. Oh, it went through it! I set this trick shot up, so I knew that it could go through it, but I didn't say anything. MATTHEW: Guys, Tommy actually has the most practice at this, and he's in the lead. TOMMY: Matthew, we need you. MATTHEW: No way. Spider-Man? TOMMY: He is proving that he is the Wow. Wow, have you ever seen such flexibility? Wow. TOMMY: If he doesn't win this medal, I don't think anyone else deserves it more MATTHEW: All right, C-Cash, please don't. [laughter] MATTHEW: Okay, I'm convinced you guys are doing this on purpose. Just for the fun of it, should I just send Matthew back up there? TOMMY: Oh, it went through. Matthew may or may not have just broken part of the fence. MATTHEW: That was pretty close. ISABEL: No way! MATTHEW: Oh! Isabel made it. Guys, Isabel gets the gold! MATTHEW: Oh, he hit the tape. MATTHEW: Good attempt. MATTHEW: No way! Maggie now gets the silver medal. What? MATTHEW: Guys, I'm about to be in last place. It's barely hanging on. That's unbelievable. The tape again! MATTHEW: That went through it. Let's go, bronze medal. That's one point, but that's huge. That's huge. COLIN: The bronze medal--Tommy. TOMMY: Thank you everybody. COLIN: The silver medal--you. MAGGIE: You? COLIN: The gold medal. [cheering] MATTHEW: Tommy takes the overall lead. MATTHEW: For the next event, everyone is shooting 10 three pointers, and the top 3 scores get medals. MATTHEW: Tommy you're going MATTHEW: First shot. It's a miss. I think a score of 5 would get you a medal. TOMMY: Look at this wind. MATTHEW: Guys, it's so windy right now. MATTHEW: 0 for 2. We need him to miss these, MATTHEW: Uh oh, he made one. MATTHEW: One for four. MATTHEW: One for five. Two for six. Two for seven. Three for eight. MATTHEW: I think a score of five is getting a medal here. MATTHEW: Three for nine. It is a little windy outside. MATTHEW: Four for 10. That's not bad. That could medal. 40%. TOMMY: Bronze maybe. MATTHEW: Three for seven. This could be really close. MATTHEW: 4 for 8. He's catching MATTHEW: 5 for 9. He's taken the lead. MATTHEW: 6 for 10! MATTHEW: Underhand? Oh. [sad music] MATTHEW: 0 for 10. MATTHEW: Okay, wind is picking up again. MATTHEW: Two for four. Guys, this could MATTHEW: Three for six! Isabel, you have a chance to beat Colin still. MATTHEW: Last shot to tie Tom. MATTHEW: 3 for 10. All right, my turn. All right, my 10 shots. I haven't warmed up at all today. 3 for 3. I need this guys. 8. C'mon! We're hitting these all. For 10 for 10 . . . TOMMY: No Matthew! MATTHEW: I literally went nine for 10 guys. Guys, I just want to say, I'm not kidding you, Matthew is one of the best shooters Outside of the NBA, I've never met another MATTHEW: 0 for one. In and out. MATTHEW: One for four. MATTHEW: One for 10. Third place goes to Tommy. Congratulations. Second place goes to C-Cash. And first goes to Matthew. MATTHEW: Finally! I have one of each. MATTHEW: I've got to find my way to get back in this game, guys. Colin and I are both tied with 9 total points. Look at this. How many medals do you have? COLIN: I have but we're still tied. The seventh event is game You have to start by getting exactly one bounce on the table, then 2, all the way up to seven. First team to do it wins gold. Next is silver. And there is no bronze for this event. One. Now Isabel needs to bounce it twice. 3. C'mon, get 4. 5. 1 2 3 This event took forever, so let's just 5. C'mon. 6. [cheering] That's seven!

And the gold and first place Matthew has tied me up now with nine points. MATTHEW: Event number 8 is mini mini-golf. We have three holes. Whoever scores first gets gold, second gets silver, and third gets bronze. Owen, since you're in last, you get to start us off. MATTHEW: Can he make it? Oh! Everyone is hitting it off that way. A little too strong. MATTHEW: To take an even bigger lead. This would be huge. TOMMY: Yes, yes, I needed that. I needed that. MATTHEW: Tommy gets gold. Tommy gets the gold medal and now we're going to cover up that hole. MATTHEW: No way! TOMMY: Are you kidding me? MATTHEW: That's two in a row. COLIN: That's to my boy Bryson DeChambeau. Bang! It almost fell off. There's the bronze medal. I'm staying alive. Staying alive, I needed that. TOMMY: Colin kept the lead but Tommy's just a point behind. MATTHEW: The ninth event is bottle flipping.

Congratulations. I win silver. Matthew wins bronze. TOMMY: And you are the winner of the video. COLIN: What do I do with all this? TOMMY: I don't know.
