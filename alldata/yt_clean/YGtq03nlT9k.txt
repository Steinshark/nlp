Let's start with the engine... Phew. It looks not easy. Oh, we fixed that right away. Then we'll put this part back on here. Then the first part of the car is back in shape. Perfect. Or what do you think? You're amazing. I will just drive the car into the castle. It will be quicker. Oh, no. That was dad. What is he doing here? Where did I park my sports car again? Oh, no, Mario. You carry on! I will distract my dad in the meantime. He mustn't find out what I've been up to. It would be so much easier if Let's go then. Hey, dad. Hi. It's good to see you. Son. I'm afraid I don't have time now. I have to take the car Yes, dad, that's important. But look, over there they are Luigi and Daisy. What are they doing by the fountain? That fountain is for Peach and me. Come on, dad. We will just get them Great idea. Let's go. What do you want from us? Weve just got a date. Get away from our fountain. Now!

Hopefully he won't tell my dad the truth. Otherwise he'll get really angry. Just. Well, just a little bit more and then I should be right with I hope Princess Peach is alright Lets go. There they are up ahead. Hahaha. Mario. Thanks again for your help. But we don't need you here anymore. So get out. Mario, quick. You have to save me. I will, Princess Peach.
