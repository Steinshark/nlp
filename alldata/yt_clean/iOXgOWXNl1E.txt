What do you call that dance, Stevie? All right, shall we? It's time for... where in the world do these Okay, you're about to taste pies and throw And of course, we have French fry darts for you again. Thank you. Chase, the pied piper cartographer TRA la la. I'm a pied piper. Can you. You're afraid to put it in your mouth. You play your little thing there. Wow. Sounds a lot like the human whistle. All right. And whoever loses today will have to shut their pie hole In Good Mythical More. And Rhett, you have a disadvantage this time. Each round you'll have to throw worst score of the three. Oh That doesn't sound fair. But you're eating pie. How bad can it be? What kind of pie? It's all the same color. It looks like it's a crust pie. Is it like custardy? What is that? that's pretty nice. There's some fruit in there. There's a custardy fruit filling. Is it apple? It's very bready. Tastes like bread pudding with it's the consistency of apple... But this pie is nowhere near as sweet as an apple pie. This is like from a place where they don't want to taste too much. You know what I mean? Hold back a little bit. Hold back with the flavor and I kind of like that. I like a little bland pie. Yeah, you're a bland guy. I like a bland pie. I'M not a bland guy. I'm a bland loving guy. Okay... I've got to throw these three. Not at the same time, but in succession. And the worst one will be Yeah. And I will say before you throw, visually, can we get rid of the old map and really We did that. And it's actually super state of the art because it's highly sensitive and it can feel exactly where you hit it. So I just want to let you It's going to be a little bit different. That's cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The map feels? Okay. I wish the map could tell me where to I'm leaning between Finland and New Zealand. I feel like it's Finland. Oh, okay. Okay, here we go. Oh, okay. So it's responding. It's feeling. Hey, that's pretty consistent. It throws. It seemed like it felt some pain. I didn't really think reaction that I was gonna feel sadness. You felt sorry for the map. I felt a little sadness for the map. Ooh, that's a long one. Gotta make it shorter. Judges? I've done it before. I do it every time. The judges love it. It's acceptable? Manipulate the darts? How do you feel about I hate it because... I think it's a coward's guess. This is from New Zealand. New Zealand is known for their... blandness. Their pies. most notably meat pies. There's a lot of, This right here, but I could have. And I'm willing to go and take the big risk. Cause I'm going for the gusto... Okay. New Zealand right there. That map sounded. It's kind of like you just It's like you just sort of poked it. It seemed indifferent. That was a very good throw though, Link. So for my next two fries. No, no, no. You don't get two fries. I ain't afraid to throw for New Zealand. You just had buco pie made from young coconuts and This island delicacy that eventually made the Philippines. Ooh, that's bad for me. No, it's not. It's good for you. Do you know where the Philippines are? Do we need a little map lesson A little map lesson for the linkster. Well, New Zealand is an island. Rhett, you had 44 and Link 24. Oh, nice for me. That was good for me. Yep, nice for you. Was it good for you? That's a tall boy. And what is that in the middle? A whole... egg. Oh, I've got confetti. Oh. Oh. Problem? I'm coming here in the back. Gosh. I did it again. Look at. Did you see the egg? I'm still trying to live that down. I'm sorry. Yeah, that wasn't popular. Stevie, Oh, that made it worse. I mean, what do you want? Do you want some of that yolk? Whoa. It's so eggy. So it's a quiche. It's a quiche with a whole egg in the middle with a bunch of spinach. This is very good. Is there something else in it? besides just some sort of spinach? You're up one egg. Yeah. I've taken the early lead. It's lonely at the top with my fry. I mean. this could be down the street. And United States is on the board. United States. We live there. I've had lots of quiche but where did it originally come from? It seems like quiche Quiche. quiche. quiche. Quiche! If you say it like that. I'm actually starting to feel Quiche. very Italian. Where's the quiche? Quiche is Italian. Right there on it. I don't get as much of a reaction. It's almost like... enjoying it a little bit. What do you think? Is this more than just quiche? It's more than just quiche That's a good point. The thing that it doesn't have that you would expect is that there's not a lot of cheese in it, That's. Cause it's the original from Italy. When I first saw it, because they'll put spinach in things like this. Yeah. Like a... Like a paneer? Like a saag. Paneer. I don't know what those... I do like it, though. Saag paneer. But there's no Indian spice at all, and so it makes me less It's actually kind of bland, too. I don't know, man. I'm making a move here. I think it is the United States. Oh, you nailed it. It's getting. It's. Oh, man. I almost hit it. Three times. All right. You didn't hit it. You just had torta Pasquale. No, torta, that's not from the U.S. Also known as Easter pie, charred egg and cheese filling is While it's typically it can be enjoyed any time of the year in Italy. Oh, my goodness. You're racking it up, man. All right, Rhett, you had 36... And... Link, you... had, surprisingly, 3.1415956. Just kidding. It's zero. You got Italy. That was a pie joke. So I did. That was pie. Pie joke. That is a bullseye is what you're saying. Yes, that joke was a bullseye, so. Yes, it was. This is the second bullseye I don't. Okay, listen, not... But with ketchup. Ketchup is not a bullseye, bro. You're not counting it? Throwing a liquid at the map You gotta have a dart to do that. I still feel good about it. You ever look at our set and think, I'd like it to be in many pieces that I Ha. Well, you're in luck. It's the GMM set puzzle. This thing is full of Easter eggs. Little things that you don't expect. Look at that. A thousand pieces gone to a thousand pieces yet. We had a 500 piece puzzle. We've doubled the pieces, but now we're giving It's available ay Mythical.com Mythical.com Ooh, what's. Is this even a pie? What? This is. What is that? That is... meat. I thought it might have been like beans or smoked pieces of very smoky. Oh, oh, there's a bunch of fish in it. There's fish? Yeah, there's fish in there. Is this all smoked fish or is there pork? No, there's. It's fish and bacon. Fish and bacon? So much fish. This is one of the easiest fish dishes Cause I thought it was smoked pork. Well, it is, but it's also fish. But I'm still not getting, like overwhelmed by fish in a way that I'm used to doing it. Hey, find a way. No, I don't want to find a way. Oh, okay. I'm only saying positive things. This is a brown...mystery of smoky fishiness. So I'm thinking Finland. Where else? The bread is interesting. Like... it could be Nigerian bread. My answer has to be Finland, because there's so much fish in there. It's just like, There might be 78 individual sardines. I would say maybe even more, Link. Maybe 250. Maybe. Maybe less. 103 Exactly All right, so I'm going for Finland. I am Get. Was that the map or was that you? Fish in my throat. I'm just anticipating That's what the map's gonna sound like. All right. Yeah, I'm feeling good about Finland. Look at that. That was. I did not like the sound it made. And I'm sorry. I can't help but make a sound Yeah, that was awkward. Because you and that map I began picturing you alone with the map. We're in sync. And that's a bullseye. The bread has, like a. It's reminiscent of, like, an Ethiopian pancake thing. That's what I've been saying. I really hope it's not Nigeria. I hope it's South Africa. It's further away from your other answer. South Africa. So I'm gonna act like it's South Africa. I'm gonna will South Cause it's further away. I'm sorry. Ears hurt. Ow. Ow. Hit you a little too low. Something about down there. The map is very sensitive. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We all understand why. You just had calacuco, pork, baked inside of a rye crust. This fishy, surprising pie comes from that country That's right. Finland. Finland exists. This is a hell of a performance, Link. Two zeros in a row. That might be a record. We might have to take away his French fries. Maybe. I mean, it's not really the spatter. It's called the dart game. It's not the spatter of the though. It's just I'm so much better But it's. I mean, if I sign up to play Olympic they don't let me play. Is that how you just sign up Yeah. And you would bring an egg? All right, Rhett, you had 45. Oh, wow. And Link hit a bullseye. What? Oh. Why am I the only one celebrating? I'll do a dance for you. Stevie, Happy birthday. I Did this for you. Oh, no. We celebrated when we saw you hit it. As a birthday present, to yourself. I mean, if this wasn't going to be the what is going to be the I don't think anyone else is upset Rhett. I'm so sorry. It's just, what, like, So I'm gonna start throwing french fries, So now we just both throw I'm okay with that. But we'll have to talk about title thumb. Yeah. See. Now we're back to a normie looking pie... It looks like it could be a. What? More confetti on my. Maybe a. It's like a sweet potato. It's very hard to get it apart. I wouldn't call this a normal piece. It looks normal. Mm. That's the consistency of a lemon. It's very thick. It's very damp. I like the taste of this. It's a mystery round any position on the map. What are you doing? Something wrong with my shoe. Nothing a good cobbler won't fix. That's a pie joke. That was a bullseye again. Right, guys? A cobbler is pie, I appreciate it, Chase. I didn't.
