She was wearing on a flannel night gown, blue wool socks, and a red down jacket. Before we get into the let's establish what led up to that point. Natalie Wood was one of the up until her untimely death. With roles that include Miracle on 34th Street, only at age 11, Rebel Without A Cause West Side Story, and Gypsy. - [Shane] Gypsy? - [Ryan] Yeah, that. - [Shane] Ah, the famous Gypsy.

(laughing) Did her mother bring - [Ryan] I imagine it was fortune tellers you see at like a carnival and like, &quot;Oh, wouldn't &quot;my fortune with the little - [Shane] &quot;Oh, maybe &quot;marry a rich man.&quot; She probably, she would. - [Ryan] &quot;You're gonna drown one day.&quot; - [Shane] &quot;Water's gonna fill your lungs.&quot; (laughing) - And the mom was like, &quot;Alright, &quot;Thank you.&quot; - &quot;Let's go get funnel cakes.&quot; (laughing) - [Ryan] In a chilling 10 years old and filming a bridge rigged to collapse despite her mother assuring Wood broke her wrist, even more terrified of the As a child she had such a phobia of water, it is said she was and had recurring - [Shane] This is brutal. - [Ryan] I know. It came true, so she in all these fears. - [Shane] This, though, were eaten by a shark. - [Ryan] Or a bear. - [Shane] Oh, I'm sorry, if you were eaten by a bear. - [Ryan] I thought for a second we were talking about things - [Shane] I made the mistake of thinking of the most apex predator, afraid of one of the - No, no, I'm gonna let this slide because I know you're just and you truly do believe dominant animal. - I truly believe that. - Yeah, it's the most in the world. - Yeah, sure it is. - It's a killing machine. - Yeah, pop that thing in - [Ryan] On Woods' 18th with actor Robert Wagner, later star of television who was 26 at the time. They married in 1957, but Wood married and divorced another man later in her life, only to in 1972. Wood herself had said that of torment were rooted in a feeling that she did not truly know herself, as people had told her Including her mother - [Shane] Jesus. - [Ryan] Yeah, she seems, than I originally anticipated. - Wagner must, I mean, does that man have a magical penis or something? They got divorced and then she-- - You think the only reason is because they have a magical penis? - I mean, I feel like divorce - Do you not know how love works? - Maybe I don't. - That makes a lot of sense actually. Pushing forward to more recent it was the weekend just Wood had been working on Brainstorm, with Christopher and he was invited to join named The Splendour that weekend. According to the captain who had worked with the couple for years and considered himself a family friend, Wood had become infatuated and Wagner has even flown out to make sure he wasn't going to quote, &quot;Make a fool of himself - This is, this is rough. - To be fair, can you blame her? - I, here's, I'm actually a I have a hard time imagining someone going gaga over Walken. - You go gaga over Walken. - I go gaga-- - You go googagoo. - You know, he's probably magnetic. I bet when you get in a room with him, he commands the space. - Yeah, no one is like, Everyone's like, &quot;Did you see &quot;Chris Walken.&quot; - What a Walken. - &quot;Boys. &quot;They party's here.&quot; - &quot;I brought some cocktail weenies.&quot; (laughing) - [Ryan] Though Wagner with a jealous streak, reports say Wood was over Wagner's on-screen romance with his Hart to Hart co-star, Stephanie Powers. The group left on the yacht around noon on Friday November 27, Wood would be found dead. Everyone on the boat, including had been drinking for much of the weekend. On that Friday night, to the point that Davern was concerned and asked Walken to get involved. Walken is known to have refused &quot;Never get involved in an argument &quot;between a man and a wife,&quot; end quote. Davern ended up taking in the yacht's 13 foot the Prince Valiant, and they slept at the Pavilion Lodge Hotel in Avalon. The first time Davern was he lied, saying that all four of them had stayed on the yacht. The police, however, already had evidence that they had not been on so Davern was prompted to tell the truth. He went on to say that he in the same room, but they just drank wine and went to sleep. Davern also claims that he felt very protective comfortable with him. - [Shane] He seems like Maybe? - [Ryan] You could spin it that, or you could spin it the other way. You could see both sides of the coin here. - [Shane] I mean, if a volatile situation. - [Ryan] Yeah, but the perhaps weren't the most valiant. - [Shane] Hm. - [Ryan] The next morning they returned to The Splendour, where Wood apparently decided to stay for based upon Walken's Walken and Wood went ashore that afternoon to begin drinking at Doug's Harbor Reef where they were later The party's waitress the consumed two bottles of wine, two bottles of champagne, was also drinking daiquiris. - Jesus. - Holy shit. - The 80s are great. - Yeah, they're just goin' to town. I'd like to imagine it was Walken, but. - Just throwing' back the daiquiris. - He seems like a daiquiri - &quot;Five daiquiris.&quot; - [Ryan] She also eat much of her dinner seem to be in a good mood. And when she left restaurant, In one moment, Wood was down onto the floor, though Walken later explained the incident because he threw his glass on the floor after making a toast and So fuckin' Walken is essentially Thor. - Yeah. - I like this drink! Another! Davern has said Walken and throughout the dinner. They boarded the dinghy, the Valiant to return to their yacht for the night at about 10 pm. As they were boarding, a Office said they hear Wood which he assumed was just Witnesses sleeping John Payne, and his reported hearing shouts However, there was a party so he figured it was from that and did not respond. Payne claimed to hear &quot;Help me! &quot;Someone please help me!&quot; end quote, coming from the near and potentially from someone in a dinghy. He also believed to hear a respond quote, &quot;Okay honey, but his tone was so mocking, he claims this is why he believed with the party. - [Shane] &quot;Mocking tone,&quot; you mean like-- - [Ryan] &quot;Okay honey, we'll go get you.&quot; - [Shane] &quot;We'll help Scary? Spooky? - [Ryan] Well, you did, with it, maybe that's what he said. Or maybe he was just joking around like, &quot;We'll go get ya.&quot; Or maybe this didn't happen at all. Maybe this guy didn't hear - [Shane] Yeah, is he just He has like binoculars, like a creep. - Star watcher. - &quot;Oh, what's goin' on there?&quot; - &quot;You know, Natalie - &quot;Oh, she's screamin'. &quot;Better take a note about that.&quot; - [Ryan] Reports say there aboard the yacht soon Wagner has said that he and debate that he began at while aboard the yacht. He describes the event saying quote, &quot;There was no fight, no anger. &quot;Just a lot of words &quot;in most political discussions. &quot;Natalie sat there not &quot;and looking bored. &quot;She left us after about a half hour, &quot;and we sat there talking &quot;Then I went to kiss her good end quote. - Hm. - What are you onto here? Or are you just holding - He didn't notice she was missing until he went to go kiss her good night. - Yes. - So that doesn't really screaming woman. - It doesn't. That's what I'm saying, you kind of don't really know who to believe here. - Hm. Hm. (laughing) - Okay. At 1:30 am that night, made a distress call to Natalie Wood had disappeared The Splendour, and about six hours later, taking us back to the start, the body of Wood was found floating about a mile away from the yacht. The Prince Valiant, the inflatable dinghy, which she has presumably left the boat on, was found washed up on the rocks, just a little further south. The ignition was off, the and the oars were locked, which started the vessel. The coroner reported that she had drunk seven or eight glasses of Her blood alcohol level was at least .14 and the police ultimately She also has superficial and lower legs as well Though at the time, to what have might have naturally occurred as she fell on the water. - [Shane] She was a little drunk. I don't know how many, I'm not a big wine guy, - [Ryan] Well you know - [Shane] .14 is pretty high? - [Ryan] That's pretty-- - [Shane] .08 is, &quot;You're drunk.&quot; - [Ryan] The 'ol, &quot;You're drunk, .14 is, &quot;You should be laying down.&quot; - [Shane] Hm. - [Ryan] Yeah - Okay well, this is gonna be tricky. I'm interested to hear the like it could be a case - [Ryan] With that, let's The first theory is that fell into the water and drowned. The conclusion drawn by in the LA County Coroner's was that Wood had fallen trying to board The Valiant. Noguchi hypothesized that her down jacket had likely become heavy and soaked, but she never thought to remove it due to her inebriated state. Fingernail scratches found show she tried to climb Eventually, she likely finally drowned due to hypothermia and exhaustion. Ultimately, it's likely as it drifted away from The Splendour. However, Wood's sister, to say on the notion. Quote, &quot;My sister was not a swimmer &quot;and did not know how to &quot;go to another boat or to shore dressed &quot;in a nightgown and socks,&quot; end quote. I guess if she's spent her whole life being afraid of water and she can't swim-- - [Shane] Probably, or something-- - [Ryan] Well, why would - [Shane] Or even attempt, - [Ryan] Yeah. - [Shane] In her nightgown no less. - [Ryan] That's why it's strange. I guess when I'm drunk, I-- - [Shane] I've done some stupid things. - [Ryan] I guess I would that I'm scared of, but, going I would never go, &quot;Hey, - [Shane] No, I wouldn't. One of my greatest fears, I is that someone will trick - [Ryan] Which is the heard in my life. - [Shane] It would be against my will. - [Ryan] How man situations potential danger? - I don't know. All it takes-- - How many parties are you - None, but-- - It's not the fear that I'm at a party, it's the fear that someone will come up to me on the street and put heroin in me and then I'm hooked forever. (laughing) Speaking of the nightgown and socks, Robert Wagner also said in &quot;It was only after I was &quot;in a sleeping gown, &quot;that it dawned on me &quot;Natalie obviously had &quot;slamming up against the boat. &quot;It happened many, many times before, &quot;and I had always gone out &quot;to keep the dinghy &quot;She probably skidded on one of the steps &quot;after untying the ropes. &quot;The steps are slick as ice because of the &quot;algae and seaweed that's &quot;After slipping on the &quot;against the boat. &quot;I only hope she was unconscious end quote. - Maybe she did just slip. Wagner sounds like he's putting forth a pretty solid theory. - Any time someone has account of what would've happened, that makes them free to go? - &quot;Here's what must've happened.&quot; - &quot;Here's what must've happened.&quot; - &quot;These 40 things in succession.&quot; (laughing) However, some have criticized this theory as the Valiant was a rubber dinghy which, according to Noguchi, would when they bump a yacht. Additionally, Noguchi including the untouched It appeared that Wood to board the dingy rather Police investigators in The Splendour's main attributed to the rough seas, a possible factor in into the water. However, it's here that the testimony of Captain Davern differs. He claimed that Wagner grabbed after going into a jealous rage over Wood and Walken's interactions. He claims Wagner exclaimed, quote, &quot;Jesus Christ, what are you trying to do, &quot;fuck my wife?&quot; end quote. - Yeesh. - So you can see where the two accounts of what happened are drastically different? - I just don't understand why would he make this up? - True, unless he was, unless he was in love with Wood and jealous of Wagner. - Oh. - See what I? You can spin anything you - Dammit, Ryan. (laughing) - What do you think when he said that? - &quot;No!&quot; - &quot;No, Bobby.&quot; &quot;Two mice.&quot; - [Ryan] Strangely, despite Wagner admitted to have that night in the salon in Yeah, weird. - [Shane] So, things not lining up. - [Ryan] It's weird that - [Shane] Yeah. - [Ryan] Almost 30 years later. - [Shane] Uh huh. - [Ryan] And with that, let's that there was foul play Before we move forward, it's worth noting that Davern is an unreliable of factors, including to come forward with what Additionally, he seemed to to the tabloids in the in a relatively unsavory way. That being said, on of his story ring more of other witnesses and other evidence. In fact, Walken's when they returned to to Davern's than Wagner's. Walken claims an argument Wood and Wagner over Wood's to which Walken defended Wood at first, but then stepped outside rather When he returned, the two had made amends. Davern also describes events this way, but instead of Wood and Wagner making up, he states he also heard from where he was on and even claims he heard He claims there was then at about 11:30 pm looking quote, &quot;Tousled and sweating &quot;in a terrible fight, an ordeal Davern also says that turning on the flood lights, in any attempt to search said he didn't want to (laughing) - Yeah, I would not wanna be this captain. - I gotta say, though, the one person who I very innocent, fuckin' Walken seems like he was just chillin'. - He was just, you know, somebody's wife. - [Ryan] Davern has since said something malicious may as he believes she would have never tried to go to shore alone, want to return, she would as she had the night before. Based on new information, from Davern, the case In 2012, the LA County Coroner's Office changes the cause of death from quote, &quot;Accidental drowning&quot; &quot;Drowning and other undetermined The new reports casts more questions on the nature of the bruises and abrasions on Woods' body, positing have been on her body before Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran, the chief medical examiner, said &quot;The location of the &quot;of the bruises, lack of head &quot;support bruising having &quot;in the water. &quot;Since there are unanswered questions &quot;and limited additional evidence available &quot;for evaluation, it is opined &quot;that the manner of death should be left &quot;as undetermined,&quot; end quote. - Well it's good to reexamine every now and then because aren't big Hart to Hart fans. - Was Hart to Hart that big of a thing? Was Wagner that big of a star? - I feel like I'd have watched it. It was about a husband and wife, detective team? - I honestly don't even know. - I'm gonna check it out. - Okay. Well you do that and you - Hart to Hart and Gypsy. - Gypsy, you gotta save Gypsy. - These are on my watch list. I hope these are on Netflix. - [Ryan] As of 2013, the LA County Sheriff Department's spokesman, Steve Whitmore, has described the case as quote, &quot;Open and ongoing. &quot;Nothing definitive has However, he had also is not a suspect. Natalie's sister said quote, being Wagner, &quot;Purposely &quot;to hurt Natalie. &quot;However, I know things &quot;much drinking and fighting,&quot; end quote. - [Shane] I'm surprised - [Ryan] Does she, though? She says-- - [Shane] Well, the thing that she said is very interesting about how, you know, when everybody's drunk, I can't imagine ever murdering someone-- - [Ryan] But when you drink you can imagine murdering someone? - [Shane] No, I'm saying even drunk, but like I ate pumpkin I just took a bite out of a pumpkin. - You're a weird dude. (laughing) - Just eating pumpkins, afraid of people stickin' Just weird. - That's a rational fear. - Yes it is. - What are we talkin' about? Natalie Wood? - I don't know, these are the Whether or not he was responsible, Wagner claims to feel in that he did not notice Christopher Walken has spoken officially saying, quote, &quot;that there was something more to it &quot;than what came out in the investigation &quot;will never be satisfied with the truth. &quot;Because the truth is, &quot;It was an accident,&quot; end quote. Dwayne Rashure, the former on the case, still says, quote, &quot;I can't tell you exactly end quote. In the end, the tragic will continue to confound the world. The familiar faces involved only add to the mystery and know what truly happened as the case of Natalie (slow, tense music)
