This literally looks like a Chromecast with two fake PlayStation controllers. Question: how do we feel about - [Ken] What year? - Yes.

However, Ken, before you go and pick up that large suspicious box, I actually have something for the room. I have something to share - [Ken] Is it a new host? (box thuds) - The brand-new Fusion Look, we can pull the Is this just an excuse and call it work? Well yes. Yes, it is. See? Look how joyous the room is. - [Ken] What is it, three? - Four cards. All right, let's go, boys. Let's go. Fun fact, the largest Pokemon set ever over 264 different cards in this set. I got a holo. You got a Blissey, but it's not a holo? Matt, what'd you get? - [Matt] Nothing. - Wow. - With our powers combined, - Can you hold that- Do not do that! Do you know what's inside this box? - [Matt] Whatever it is, it's refurbished. - I actually know what this is. Cause I had to lift this box This my friends is an iMac that we bought on Wish.com - [Ken] Oh oops! - Yeah, you- - [Ken] Oh, I forgot about that. - [Jared] Won't be an iMac anymore. - This was an iMac from Wish.com. Can you look at this please? - [Ken] Ew. - [Jared] It says Apple. - [Ken] Oh! - [Jared] Oh my god. - Can someone get some disinfecting wipes. Thank you. So this is a relatively modern iMac. It's still the current 8th generation, 'cause they're still - [Ken] So it's like - Yeah., and this is the oh, but you know what? It must be an older one instead of Thunderbolt 3. - [Ken] It's a 2013, 21 inch one terabyte hard drive, - Oh wow, I'm an idiot. Why would I spend that much money on this? I will say this is actually The screen is pretty much flawless. We'll see when we actually fire it up, but I'm not seeing any like It looks too obvious here. While the iMac is ready, What else do we have? Okay, I caught it. Oh, I know what this is too! Look at this. Mr. Austin Evans, finally, Wishtery Tech, reminded all the listings before I'm going to need an - [Ken] What? We'll be right back. - I assist. - [Austin] At least you're - [Jared] That's true, I'm not. - Ken, how are you doing these days? - [Ken] I mean fine. - That LS of yours. - [Ken] Oh. - [Austin] It's getting - [Ken] Yeah? - May I offer you an alternative way to not only live your life, but to improve it? Enrich it to some extent. Would you be interested - [Ken] No, but I mean, I'm curious to see what the hell your- - Jared, please come in. I propose to you- - [Ken] Oh! Right, that, yeah right. I still haven't watched that. - You haven't seen it? - What? The joke is ruined! Ken, how have you not watched Squid Game? (group laughs) - [Ken] Are those your or are you just happy to see me? - I can explain! It's not what you think! - So update, the iMac didn't boot after like over 10 minutes, and then a minute later, it's So either it's fixed itself that doesn't work. I think I need another item. Ken, you have no respect. Okay. What is this? Ah! Damn it, past Austin. Why would you do this to me? It's electric Oh my God. Do you want to know what of this thing is? - [Jared] 20 watts. - 50 watts! - [Ken] Whoa! You could charge your MacBook off that! That's cool. - 50 Watts to my nipples, man. - [Matt] I don't know, who's You're just adding that. - Well, where else do you put them? - [Matt] I literally said your abs. - Look, I bought it for a reason. - [Jared] Is this a self report? - [Austin] Pikachu used Thunderbolt. - Take it off, boy. - You happy, Matt? - No. Not since about 1998. This is a dead-ass meme, but I like ya cut, G! (group laughs) - So wait, we're doing the abs? Wait- - Yeah, it specifically says abs. - But I see- - But since you wanted to. - No! No, no! Wait, could we test - [Group] No. - Oh okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay. - It's on? - Yup, yup. - That is the lowest possible setting. - Wait, Leave it there for a second. Let me talk. Okay, so. (group laughs) - [Ken] Okay maybe let's stop. Oh god. - Wait, wait, wait. Maybe we should stop it now. - [Matt] I haven't heard a safe word yet. - [Ken] I was gonna say (indistinct) - What level am I on right now, Matt? - You're at 50%. (Austin yells) - All right, I'm good. I'm good. (yells) - [Jared] Tap out, tap out, tap out, tap out, tap out, tap out, tap out. - I'm good. I'm good. - Off. Today was a good day. - I don't know who wants to Like I honestly don't know - [Ken] Well, most importantly, I mean, I'm glad you're okay, but you know, what's not? - The iMac still hasn't booted. - [Ken] Yeah. - [Austin] Huh. Okay, that I did technically catch, but made slightly too much - [Ken] That would not have Don't worry, this is the We're good. - Ah. Well then we're just going to continue on with the P5 cooling stand Wait didn't we already use one of these when we built the ultimate PS5? - [Ken] Yes, I don't know but I mean- - [Austin] So it is one solid piece. So basically what you get here, oh wow. It even comes with a separate screw, and a little plastic protector so you can screw it all the way into the bottom of your PS5. That actually is fairly nice. I'm not sure where the because I don't see anywhere - [Matt] I mean there's slots - Also this technically but also there's this giant I can tell you right now, the air is supposed to come out. I feel next to nothing. - [Ken] Wait, what the hell? Yeah, that is nothing. What the hell? It's an intake. It's absolutely an intake. So it's the other way around. So it's sucking hot air - It's channeling it out through the side, 'cause you can feel- - [Austin] I do feel the wind. - [Ken] The wind on the side. They do know heat rises, right? That's how that works? Also all the exhaust is - [Austin] Ah, this is fine. I will say though my favorite part of it is a hundred percent not only a good spot to even though it's a little bit not stable, but actually seeing the state of charge and a nice big screen with the little LED, pretty cool. But as far as the fan? (fan whirs loudly) That ain't it, chief. I'm so happy 'cause Wish sucks! I mean, I love Wishtery Tech, well that one's a bounceable product. More earbuds! Why the hell did I buy so many ear buds? - [Ken] Austin! - Why did I buy the leading ear buds? Are you sure I bought these? I don't think I bought these. What the hell is this? The 2.4 gigahertz wireless Supports 40 emulators. Look, PS2 controllers. - In all fairness, this without the rumble motor. - It's definitely the same shell. - It's just as light, and this is definitely but it has a battery door in the back. - Well, I found our dongle. It looks like a Chromecast Hello, it is functioning, which is not 4K. Uncle Poo! Long time no see, dude! Driver! There was Driver! Wow! Oh! The driving mechanics. Oh, ow, oh. Oh, they're the cops. - [Austin] Not the cops. - [Ken] Uh, uh, uh, uh. - [Austin] I'm stuck! There you go. - [Ken] Wow, what (bleeps) cops Initial D! - [Ken] Let's go! Wow, we lucked out on that one. - [Ken] Let's go! Lets go! - I've never played this for PS1. - [Ken] Yo, is that an AE-86? The Hachi Roku itself? - Uh? Uh? Uh? This doesn't seem promising. You know, we had a moment of joy there. We all experienced it together. There's a moment of - [Ken] That was genuinely the happiest I think I've ever been on set. - [Jared] Maybe the real Initial D is the friends we've made along the way. - [Ken] No, Jared. I have no friends. - We don't do that here. (Jared gasps) - It took that long to load? We're going through an Initial D dot dot dot. Woo! - [Ken] This is really nice. - For a PS1 game, it was It's '99. - [Ken] Austin, you gotta - I don't know any of - [Ken] There, yeah! - This is actually pretty fun, and I would recommend it. When it comes to Mystery Tech, or Wishtery Tech as it were, there's a certain level And who better than the (whispers) This is where you come in. The mysterious man himself, Super Saf! - That was a late entrance. I thought I'd add to the mystery. - [Austin] Welcome. This is the first time in like three years. - [Saf] It has been three years. I'm excited. Looking forward to this. - [Austin] You should lower - [Saf] Okay. - That was pretty good. That was a solid, like - [Saf] I'm going to blame the throw. - [Ken] To be fair, yes. I could have done that better. - So these look familiar. How much was this pair of AirPods Max? They're completely legitimate from Wish. - [Matt] So fun fact about these ones. - Oh no. Are they gone? - [Matt] So you paid $30 for them. They never actually showed up. Someone had sent us these We had these before you - I mean, how bad could they be? Saf! Saf! Saf! - I'm a professional unboxer. (Austin cheering) - There we go. - This looks pretty legit. The real box takes a long time to open. - [Saf] Yeah. - [Austin] Oh wow. Wait, what? We know that not everyone so we decided to create the best possible of the original AirPods Max - [Ken] I don't know if that's allowed? - This is sus now. Is this Wishtery Tech? is this Mystery Tech? Is this promoting atpromax.com? It says designed by Apple in California. - Can they do that? - No, no, no. You can't do that. AirPods Max on the sticker? Ooh. Oh geez. Oh, that does not. Oh. I will say the headphones Like definitely plastic. Like it's like- - [Saf] Oh yeah, yeah. - Much, much lighter. The case is actually fairly close. It's not quite the same, but like it's close enough. - The front again seems slightly off and even with the mesh. - [Austin] Yeah. - [Saf] You can tell it's not- - [Austin] Look, AirPods- - [Ken] Lowercase M? Are you serious? - [Saf] Change it just (group gasps) - Okay, things are happening. - [Ken] That's illegal! That's illegal! - Put them on. See what happens. - All right, they feel a lot lighter. - That's probably for the better honestly. They're pretty heavy normally. Man, Saf is super stylish - Nah. Absolutely not. I'm like white girl dancing now. - [Ken] No, no, no. And this is how guests don't come back. It was a nice knowing you, Saf. Thanks for stopping by. - Thank you. - [Saf] Okay. I'm going to let you do this one. - This is Best- I know what this is! I know what this is! Best by March 31st, 2022. Would you like to eat some (Austin laughs) Saf showed up to the office this morning with a beautiful bag Coffee? Candy. And this seems like not a very good trade. - Yeah, I kind of don't - [Ken] Here's the thing. We didn't know Wish even You buy food on Amazon, So I wonder how much better it is on Wish or are you're just going to- - Oh, he's doing it. - [Matt] We're not - [Ken] But we're going - I can't eat it because - That is actually, that's a very valid, that's a very valid point. - Yes! - [Ken] It's just a thought Wish.com. - I'll let you to do the honors. I'll catch- - [Ken] And Saf will open. - [Saf] Okay. - [Austin] What is this? A speaker? Why did I buy a speaker? I gotta stop doing this. I think it looks good - [Speaker Voice] The device already, ready to connect. - That's a lot of words to just say on. (relaxing music plays) - [Austin] You know? Well- - It has a microSD card slot. - Okay, cool. I'm sold. - Done. - I'm so disappointed. Two things? Okay. Which one do you want? - This one. - Oh boy. I got my fold Bluetooth dual call headset with what has got to be the (Austin gasps) It came after all! Wait a minute! - 30 bucks. - Wait a minute! This was here all along! - [Saf] Oh, oh. - [Austin] Ooh. Oh, that looks not good. Oh no. - [Saf] Oh! - [Ken] It looks great I'm not going to lie. - [Austin] The lighting This weighs nothing. Like I thought the other ones were light. Like this weighs actually nothing. - [Ken] It's also smaller than real pairs. - Well, while you're having fun with that, take a look at this. - Oh cool. Can you hear that? (headphones crunching) (group groans) - [Ken] That sounds like my - Oh, they do come off. - [Ken] Oh that don't look the same. - [Austin] That's not good. - [Ken] Wait, is that one ear? Oh. We got Frankenstein over here. Look at this. - But like how deep are - Too deep. - Too deep. You know when you go to the doctor and they stick the thing in your ear? That's the vibe. That's the vibe. - Ooh. All right, so they give me a headache, but for 30 bucks, the sound is not bad. - Really? - Like for 30 bucks. They are not comfortable. Those were a lot more comfortable because they're just hard plastic. So when you put them on - [Matt] It looks like it's gonna break- - Yeah, and it's really - All right. Let's see who has the worst They're not terrible. Very sparkly, very treble-y, they're like, it's like 90% high end. It's like, there's like whispers of bass. - I can't explain sound like that. - Don't buy these on Wish. Look, when you have the biggest in the office, you gotta yeet it together. - Three, two. - My headphones are still (both laugh) So I hope this was as - I mean, I started here and - That checks out. - [Ken] That's a very generous review. You're like, I like that the blow for us. - [Ken] Yeah.
