The West Bradley, the So before I board a flight, I want to go down here to (soft, ethereal music plays) I am wondering, is this still LAX? This is so nice; it's unreal, almost, but look at how busy outside and inside here feels so tranquil. Especially with this blue ceiling on top, it feels like very oceanic, right? We're heading to the west, The terminal is to the west (upbeat music plays) Very interesting, I saw a Legion, some country frontier So, I always thought Bradley but that's no longer the case.

(gentle music plays) So good morning, just after about six hours sleep. And you may ask, &quot;What on Earth is this?&quot; This is not on the Emirates airline menu.
