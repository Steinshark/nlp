For me personally, I don't sleep at night. You don't sleep at night. I wake up to. To check the markets. To. To. Yeah. To. And if you are going to allow insider crypto trading like it's happening right now, we all see it happening. We all do a little bit of it. We all we all do. What is Web4 about? What is Web4 all about? Oh. That. That I'm not into this. What is the Web4 all about? That's a good question. Actually. After the big depression in Web3 last year, I decided to check on my investments and reassure myself that crypto was still fully focused on its core value. Making money. So I fly to the most prestigious conference in the world. Better than EthCC, EthGlobal, and Bitcoin Miami Beach. I go to Web3 Berlin in 3rd world country Germany to talk to tech founders and other con artists. I go to my first panel to remind myself what Web3 exactly is, but I lose focus and discover the most sane person in the room. The bouncer. Who was this bouncer? So I interviewed the bouncer and taught him some buzzwords Now I'm entering the hallways of the conference, There are more exhibitors than participants. I'm now trying to talk to some of the unsuccessful startups to see what still drives them to squeeze the last satoshis out of Bitcoin. Describe your company in one word. In one word in one word. Adopters. Transparent. Blockchain made for trade finance probably fitting all kinds of use cases What makes Flamingo different? [..] You don't have to identify yourself. You don't have to identify. So it's the perfect platform for money laundering. For me. That's also a big thing that we consider that the platform is used for money laundering, but we don't really have any control over that. Shouldn't we just normalize insider trading and mingling of funds instead of the whole pain of regulation? I'm not sure if regulating insider trading is the way to go, because then you have a lot of people being at the top trying to extort money from the people at the bottom. When is Flamingo going to get sued? We hope never, because we are based in Norway. We escape the whole American SEC thing. We escape the China thing, and we also escape a little bit the laws in Europe. But outside of Norway, do you think there's any exchange that is operating legally in Web3 right now? I think you have some exchanges that are paying all the taxes and all the fees and everything they need to do to be a legal exchange. But I also feel that they are not profitable. So here I am walking across the boards of several scam companies that I have invested in, some of them in the past. Who can we still trust in crypto and are there any genuinely good people in crypto? Yes, I'm sure there are. Michael Saylor has a tax fraud lawsuit. Miami Coin is 99% down. Bitcoin City is canceled and there are mass incarceration in El Salvador. Why do you still believe in crypto? I believe because it is a promising tech. A lot of the actual market is based a lot on hype and we try to change that. Basically... You're trying to change that? Exactly. So we are based on utility. You don't have really DeFi protocols, which like I don't know have fancy names, and the only thing you do there is basically farm. One of those I don't know, pizza token whatever. Cheeseburger token. So you don't believe in Cheeseburger token? So I believe really in real-world utility because there are real-world utility use cases. So you are involved in some of them. But can you give me one example? The problem is most of them are under NDA and I can't share them publicly. This is the networking area. This is where people without a job are trying to convince people without a company to hire them. How would you describe poochain simply? poochain is the home for all the [...] coins. Me, for example, I'm working in a project poogrow. Describe to me the typical meme coin enthusiast. You know the day. How does he look like the typical m.. they are players, the typical meme coin enthusiast I think they are players too. Big players. Also, they they like to like to see the chat hyped. We're launching a coin. It's called quinoa coin. At the end of the month, I can tell you right now it's a typical pump and dump. But the project is very exciting because many DAO members from the DAOs are going to be involved. There's a public discord already, but there's also private discord. I can invite you to the private discord. What the actual action happens, Where it communicates when you buy, when you sell, Not the public one. The insider trading one. If you want, I can send you that also. Let's see. I will. I think I will. I will check out the community and more... Again it's classical pump and dump. There's literally no utility Yeah, eh do you have telegram? I sold my house. I lost 2 boats because of crypto. Michael Saylor brought me into this. He said Bitcoin is going to go to 100,000 and now we're here. And all of my NFT are useless. Yeah it dependence. NFTs have a use case. At this time, you have already the case that if you invest in NFTs like 90% of the time they depreciate in value. Main reason why all this kind of tokens of ... people are holding their tokens because they don't want to move them because it will cost them too much in fees. Can we end the session with a Show-your-NFT? Do you have your NFT wallet with you? Yes, but I actually I don't have that much NFTs. There was an update an update from metamask Since then all of my NFTs We have. Yeah, but my colleague was just... Oh you don't have a personal NFT wallet. I but. You lost your NFT wallet? So it just we have a But do you have an NFT or do you want my NFT? Do you have Azukis I do not have Azukis. unfortunately Do you have cryptopunks. Do you have bored apes? I do not have... So you're not going to be on the bored ape party later on? No. I don't know if they're.. This is your wallet? This guy could buy the entire conference. Will you be at the bored ape yacht party later? I don't know yet for sure. Okay. But... Can you bring me in? We can talk about that in a moment. Okay. I'm actually in it for the tech. I like the technology. You're not in it for the money. I. I have made my money already. Okay, okay. So now I really believe in how it works. If it's like a cult, who is the leader? I think right now the leader is profit. I realized Web3 became a cult, just like Agile. Finally let us get lifted by the spirit of Agile Scrum ceremonies Scrum poker Alignment meetings So then finally, finally, there is no time left anymore to Alright Who's down for gamification? Yeah. GM GM GM GM GM So this is the entire conference It's only one floor for both the people who lost money and the people who lost crypto. If you put your money into [...] coins that you don't trust or that you don't really know that they are going to succeed. For me, personally, I don't sleep at night. Now, Flamingo is not just for trading. There's also DeFi use cases and there's lots of these things so we have DeFi DeSci DePi DePly DeMy DeCry DeGi Correct. and DeLy yeah. It's the first time I heard about Web
