And when in my 20s, Jeffrey and he was the husband and I was the wife, and I really wanted to and it was really hard to do. And so we took a little and we came out of it as partners, And I really credited the rest But it was scary, 'cause he that wanted to be his wife. - [Interviewer] What was the - The key to that moment was and we both changed. He understood that my work So we had two jobs that we and Jeffrey's attitude always is, &quot;Let's see if we can do them And we did.

So it was incredible and realizing things that For example, he wrote a letter saying, &quot;I wanna take you to Paris.&quot; In the beginning, we probably so maybe we'll go camping. And then later, maybe if we we'll be able to stay in a hotel, and maybe someday, we'll be And I had no recollection of this letter, but in fact, that's exactly what happened. In between his military we had four months and nothing to do, and we decided the only was to go camping in Europe and literally had $5 a the campsite, and food. Everything we needed was $5. If you spent $10, you had And that's what we did for four months.

So I'll bring like really good coffee they can have the next morning or granola or muffins or something. Something for the next - [Interviewer] What's you'll never make again? - Having a party for 20 people (laughs) and deciding I'll make Bad idea, 'cause I was in I've learned from that. I like small parties for like six. So the more the host is part of the party, the more people have fun. It's really not about the food. It's about the community that you create. (bright music)
