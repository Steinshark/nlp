(digitized beep trilling) - [Falcon] There are a that have just kind of been lost to time. People that have made and I don't know where they are now, or at least I wouldn't if But man, wouldn't it be were able to make the and storm the main stage? Hi folks, it's Falcon, 10 Legendary Developers That Starting off with number 10, one I am very fond of, Founded on May 23rd, 1990, Raven Software practically amongst those who know who they are. I mean, that may be the nature of what an introduction is for, for the people who but whatever, they're legendary. That's the point I'm making here. The problem is they've in the shadow of other 3D Realms, Bungie, but the thing is, their work as long as they've existed. Like, they were trailblazers They made &quot;Heretic&quot; and &quot;Hexen,&quot; and honestly, those were games and I know that that's but I got &quot;Hexen&quot; on a PC Gamer demo disc when it came out, and I was like, &quot;Oh my God, it's like 'Doom,' but better.&quot; I mean, it literally It was the &quot;Doom&quot; engine, But anyway, they made the first two &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; games, the good ones. Also the surprisingly good &quot;Star They made &quot;Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast.&quot; The list just goes on and on. I also, like, in all seriousness, I always forget that they made which are these top-down action games with some RPG stuff going on. They're kinda dated at this point, but they are some of the All three of Raven's last games as an independent studio are fantastic. The &quot;X-Men: Origins Wolverine&quot; and &quot;Singularity,&quot; which is a great mix of &quot;Call of Duty&quot; and &quot;Bioshock.&quot; They did amazing work, but they're doomed to suffer the same fate as so many other great They're just condemned in the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; mines. I know we say that phrase very often, but, like, that's what it is. Raven started out as an assist studio, but as the main studios started to crumble under the pressure, they and they're considered one of the main developers of the series. And, like, in all seriousness, they're continuing to The campaign for &quot;Black and it's one of the best campaigns the series has seen in years. (cavernous metallic clanking) - [Marshall Hang on, I've got you. (metal clanks) (water splashing) - [Falcon] So, yeah, it's or on death's door or anything. They're actually doing quite but seeing their creativity makes me wish they could go back to doing their own thing again. Like, imagine this version of Raven, after all the experience they've gathered, making a new &quot;Hexen&quot; or, hell, make a &quot;Singularity&quot; sequel. That'd be friggin' amazing. It's never gonna happen, of course. &quot;Call of Duty's&quot; too to consider doing anything else, and, you know, Raven kinda reviews high, let's say. They know what they're doing, and I'm glad they're still doing well and making cool story modes. But the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; games are, regardless of how good kind of a limited canvas They have a long and storied history, so it's just kind of a shame that they're not able and respect into supporting No, they wouldn't make as and, I mean, that's why the but I would love to see Raven free of those obligations someday, just to see what they (machine gun fire rattling) (electricity fizzing) At number nine is Crytek, another developer that They've still got a under their belt with &quot;Hunt Showdown,&quot; but it's clearly not as good a place as they have been in the past. Their first games were Electronic Arts, Microsoft, but all their games post-2016 and that includes the which they've said almost nothing about other than announcing it They might not be in an but the &quot;Can it run 'Crysis'?&quot; Their technology was very impressive. &quot;Crysis&quot; was a big step and while it wasn't the most and as a game, it kinda craps out about 2/3 of the way through it, but it's a solid game for the most part, and it cannot be denied how was, anyways. I mean, now it's a little dated-looking, but then it was insane. (explosions booming) we've got Raptor. - [Tub] All Whiskey Tango elements KIA. Moving to checkpoint 2-0. (explosions booming) - [Falcon] And that wasn't Before that, they made and while the rest of the series became something significantly different, that original game was one I mean, it was goofy as hell, but the levels were massive and nonlinear and really fun to screw around in. Their other work might be hit or miss, and the &quot;Crysis&quot; sequel got hit with consolization pretty hard, which maybe isn't that and might make for &quot;Crysis but I think their original those are enough to make worthy of a real comeback. It's still possible, too. If &quot;Crysis 4&quot; does actually come out, they can really show the without any restraint. I don't have expectations, per se. I don't know if they but I would sure love to see them pull off a return to form. (gunshots firing) (grenade blasts) - [Combatant] Grenade. (footsteps trudging) (crate clattering) - [Falcon] At number Sony's legendary internal but its legacy of making innovative games is definitely not forgotten. During the early years of PlayStation, these guys were responsible for some of the most memorable games of that console generation. Talking about stuff like &quot;Ape Escape,&quot; &quot;Aiko,&quot; the &quot;Siren&quot; game, &quot;LocoRoco,&quot; the list goes on. Honestly, the Japanese it was a lot of what gave They're an essential part of so them getting shut down in 2021 was a real disappointment for fans of odd and interesting first-party games. Their demise, for many, is for the old Sony, the experimental guys with a wide variety of first-party games. Now we're firmly in the era The &quot;Gravity Rushes&quot; and the &quot;Puppeteers,&quot; they're, you know, they're indies, they're kinda not a big part (protagonist shouting) (epic music) Uh, not that &quot;God of War&quot; and &quot;Horizon&quot; and &quot;The Last of Us&quot; are bad, but they're definitely a And it's just a little slowly move away from the studio that did so much for them in the past. At least with Team ASOBI still around, there are some offbeat like &quot;Astro Bot,&quot; which in of not just the entire but Japan team in particular. With &quot;Astro Bot&quot; proving there's no better time for if not in name, then at least in spirit. Like, these games don't as Sony's biggest franchise, but they make a good buffer game that drives interest in consoles. Like, Nintendo's proven keep a console alive in And it certainly ain't tech with them. They just bring out stuff that's good, have a few blockbusters, and have some stuff Doesn't matter if the games don't all sell &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot; numbers. It keeps interest. And in all seriousness, there are not a lot of games They're big, and a lot of but, I mean, we could have you know? And the thing is, Japan and I would like more new At number seven is Criterion Games. The fate of all Activision studios is to eventually get that is &quot;Call of Duty,&quot; but over at Electronic Arts, everyone eventually becomes a support studio for &quot;Battlefield,&quot; and such is the fate of Criterion, the legendary developers Okay, with EA, it's not You can also get swallowed up by the &quot;Need for Speed&quot; games. That's the sad fate of Criterion, forced to split their time for &quot;Need for Speed&quot; I mean, at least they get top billing on &quot;Need for Speed Unbound,&quot; but compared to something that at least felt like a continuation of their &quot;Burnout&quot; games, the spark of the old Criterion games, it seems like it's completely which is a huge shame because, man, &quot;Burnout 3&quot; and &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Paradise,&quot; they are some of the and it's sad to see such chained to a franchise that's... I mean, it used to be one &quot;Need for Speed&quot; games are not bad. I like them a lot, but the Like, I like the arcade-y racing games, and &quot;Need for Speed&quot; is very much that. It is one of the better. It's just &quot;Burnout 3&quot; was the best, as far as I'm concerned. But compared to the output what's coming out of Yeah, this is just a 'cause it's by far the that they've made. I mean, they did &quot;Black,&quot; and I definitely would not be against an even crazier sequel to that game, but mostly I want a new &quot;Burnout.&quot; And the only way that's somehow casts away the EA shackles, which probably not likely. At number six is Konami. Oh, boy, time for a Let's get into Konami. Does Konami deserve a comeback? I mean, from all the about how they treat their employees to their alleged real-life Yakuza ties, they're pretty sketchy in And in the last decade, they have all but in terms of their gaming division. Why? In the pursuit of easy money in the gambling and health spas sector, which, (wry chuckle) all right. Now with new gambling Konami is like, &quot;Oh, ho-ho, We need, we gotta go back to that uh, that game stuff.&quot; So they've gone back trying to milk their most as much as possible. Sometimes this leads to absolute trash, like &quot;Contra: Rogue Corps,&quot; and sometimes it leads to like the &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; remake. And uh, more of the latter, please. Konami used to be one of Like, they put out a on the NES, the entire &quot;Castlevania.&quot; Like, it's absurd, the IP that they have. And what's crazy is that right now, &quot;Castlevania&quot; is absolutely huge. It seems like everybody but Konami wants to do something with it, besides putting out a few, admittedly, high-quality collections. But what I, and I know a is for Konami to just take it seriously and make a real comeback. Make a proper, big-budget Give us a proper &quot;Silent not all the junk that Give us a new &quot;Megaman/Bomberman.&quot; Give us a big-money &quot;Contra.&quot; Hell, bring back &quot;Bloody Like, so many great series could be brought back. Like, imagine a Konami that's as prolific as modern-day &quot;Capcom&quot; with games that are of similar quality. That would be completely amazing. Hell, and this is controversial, but make a new &quot;Metal Gear.&quot; It's been long enough. There's more than enough people who understand &quot;Metal Gear,&quot; albeit maybe not as much But like I said, it's been long enough. &quot;The Hudson River, two years ago, the whole thing stank.&quot; (chuckles) I mean just contract Platinum to make another &quot;Metal Gear You want proof games can be profitable? That'll do it, I promise you. At number five is &quot;Cavia.&quot; If you never heard of these guys, then their catalog probably The quality of their games range from kind of okay to the dirt worst. They made a lot of anime tie-in games and &quot;Resident Evil&quot; But in between all that, that maybe aren't And by that, I mean all around good games. They might do something. They're weird, and they're interesting. And I guess in some ways but not all. I'm talking about 2003's &quot;Drakengard&quot; and the 2010 stealth sequel, &quot;NieR.&quot; Yes, this is actually a but Cavia is an interesting During the PS1, PS2, and mostly ending at there was so many weird little just plugging away, doing their own thing, making a ton of games that didn't have a lot of mainstream appeal, and in fact, weren't even but were interesting. FromSoftware started out until they hit it big with &quot;Souls.&quot; And while Cavia to make that happen, I feel like the opportunity was there. That's why Cavia needs to make a comeback, along with Yoko Taro, the absolute madman behind He hasn't really disappeared. Like, he's done minor work but he really hasn't got a chance to flex his creative muscles since 2017, and it doesn't even or a new &quot;Drakengard.&quot; He could do something I just wanna see something from the man who once answered an Many of gaming's biggest legends are now at the tail end of their career, or in some cases are enjoying but Taro is still capable of and I'd just love to see more from him. Has the same devil-may-care spirit as the games he made with Cavia. At number four is Free Radical. Sometimes, dreams do come true. That's how I felt when it was announced that Free Radical was reforming and they were working on a It felt like the impossible was possible, like gaming was going to be good again. Life was worth living again, and then... Like a day later, they came out and said, &quot;Yeah, sorry, we're actually dead again. Bye, and that's it.&quot; Embracer giveth, and Embracer taketh away. Made up of former Rare staff that worked on classic Free Radical was keeping and &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; alive, while Rare was burning it in effigy with the embarrassment that All the &quot;TimeSplitters&quot; games are great, especially the second and third ones. &quot;Second Sight&quot; was pretty great, too. We won't talk about &quot;Haze,&quot; but whatever. The story of Free Radical has become a bit of a Their &quot;Star Wars Battlefront&quot; They got folded into Crytek, where they suffered a and they were miraculously revived with the same core leadership as before, only to die with, like, when Embracer's ambitions for free money from the House of Saudi fell through. Can Free Radical come back again? Hey, it's happened once, and maybe lightning can strike Yeah, it's probably not Maybe somebody will come around and make a spiritual or they could get the license with a different name or something. I just really want &quot;TimeSplitters 4.&quot; That's kind of what this one's about. At number three is Ion Storm, another beautiful dream The idea behind Ion Storm sounded absolutely great on paper, a creative-led studio where developers could make the games they without deadlines or oversight. It was fronted by industry legends like John Romero and Tom Hall. They brought in Warren Spector to do a little game called &quot;Deus Ex.&quot; At their best, it was a studio that you just wouldn't On the flip side, though, John Romero's magnum opus came out years after it was supposed to and sucked big time. Their original plan to buy to finish for an easy profit proved to be a bad idea, too. With &quot;Dominion 3,&quot; they ended up taking way longer to finish it than and it ended up costing At the end, it did not sell well. Bad. The point of these kinds of studios is to make amazing games that but not crappy ones that I will say, Tom Hall's &quot;Anachronox,&quot; great game, very interesting, didn't do well, but that was the kind of games I wanted to see from these guys. Obviously, &quot;Deus Ex&quot; was from the company's real lasting legacy, is that of mismanagement They bought a penthouse Everyone had to cover up their so they could actually see Absurd and expensive. The poor planning part doesn't but the rockstar developer collective idea is something I can get behind. I'd love to see it, if not the execution, but I'd love to see the idea come back. Even if it ends up being maybe we can get another &quot;Deus Ex.&quot; At number two is Origin Systems. Founded 41 years ago and defunct for 20, Origin is one of those from the early days of video gaming. The long-running &quot;Ultima&quot; series is one of the most legendary in gaming, and you can see their from anything that calls itself meaning all the way up These guys are one of, if not the most high-profile And while it's obviously to bring back the original I would love to see with the promise of a new &quot;Ultima&quot; game. Just leave out Richard Garriott, I think, while he's a legend, he's embarrassed himself quite a bit with games like &quot;Shroud of the Avatar.&quot; Also, how sleazy his other Keep him away from any revival. He's not quite Peter Molyneux yet, or maybe Peter Molyneux I don't know, one of the two. But either way, it's not far. Back in their prime, though, Origin wasn't just cranking They were doing tons and the place fostered all John Romero worked there Warren Spector produced Chris Roberts of &quot;Star Citizen&quot; fame got his start with the acclaimed Yeah, modern-day Chris can stay home, too, if they actually get this thing going. Be nice if they got Mostly, I just want a new &quot;Ultima.&quot; After &quot;Baldur's Gate 3,&quot; I think there's a real opportunity and expand the freeform RPG where you can do almost anything idea. There's just so much potential there that's just not been explored. And finally, at number With BioWare making a comeback after the failure of &quot;Anthem,&quot; it goes to show you that one bad game shouldn't tank an entire studio, even if they did work on Sure, &quot;Suicide Squad was a major misfire, but They should have a second chance. I don't wanna see them and shot like Sony did with Firewalk. One bad game shouldn't be especially when the three &quot;Arkham&quot; games they made previously Not just good, in fact. They were innovative and They kind of caused but they did it in a way that modern games also still struggle to do. I mean, look at any game versus how it looks to call in the Batmobile in &quot;Arkham Knight.&quot; It's seamless. Their technical wizardry and the way they were and do something new and exciting especially because of for that first &quot;Arkham&quot; game. Rocksteady doesn't just they deserve one for how to the entire gaming industry. We've seen what other developers have done when they try to copy It's not bad or anything. It's often pretty good. Like, you could argue the are ultimately built but for the most part, For whatever reason, their more creative, and more fun to play, so I'd love to see them get a chance at returning to the things It doesn't really even just something that is like those games. Like, imagine if Rocksteady and it wasn't anything It was like the old &quot;Arkham&quot; games. Or hell, make up a mascot character and make one of those games with it. I don't care. I just don't care. Just let them make the kind And that's all for today. Leave us a comment, let If you liked this video, click Like.
