- YOU HAVE TO HAVE A MEANING LIFE IS A SERIOUS BUSINESS. YOU'RE ALL IN. IT'S A FATAL BUSINESS, RIGHT? EVERYONE'S IN IT UP TO THEIR NECK AND YOU NEED A MEANING THAT AND THAT'S TO BE FOUND IN RESPONSIBILITY. WE ALL KNOW THIS, THAT IT'S BETTER TO LIVE EVERYONE KNOWS THAT. THAT'S WHAT YOU TEACH (AUDIENCE CLAPPING) THE REASON THAT I THINK IS THAT I'M VERY PESSIMISTIC. MOST TIMES WHEN YOU LISTEN TO SOMEONE WHO IS A MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER, LET'S SAY, IT FILLS YOU WITH A TEMPORARY OPTIMISM. BUT YOU GO HOME, AND THE WISER PART OF YOU KNOWS THAT MOSTLY IT'S THE WITH A FRESH COAT OF PAINT. AND I TELL MY AUDIENCES VERY CLEARLY THAT THEIR LIFE IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT, AND SOMETIMES DIFFICULT BOTH AND THAT THAT IS IF IT ISN'T IN YOUR PRESENT, AND FOR MANY PEOPLE IT'S IN THEIR PRESENT. AND THAT CAN BE UNBEARABLE, ENOUGH TO TURN YOU AGAINST TO DRIVE YOU TO NIHILISM, AND WORSE, TO DRIVE YOU TO OF INFINITE SCOPE TO NOT ONLY BE TURNED AGAINST YOURSELF AND YOUR FELLOWMEN, BUT TO BE TURNED AGAINST BEING ITSELF BECAUSE OF ITS INTRINSICALLY AND THAT IT'S WORSE THAN THAT, ACTUALLY, BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONLY THAT WE SUFFER AND THAT WILL NECESSARILY OCCUR, BUT THAT WE ALL MAKE OUR SUFFERING WORSE BECAUSE OF OUR IGNORANCE AND EVERYONE KNOWS THAT TO BE TRUE. AND SO THE DISCUSSIONS START, LET'S SAY, ON AN UNSHAKEABLE FOUNDATION. BUT THEN I CAN TELL DESPITE THAT, WE'RE REMARKABLE CREATURES. WE'RE CAPABLE OF TAKING UP AND FACING THE REALITY OF WE CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT. AND ALL OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND THIS IS INDEPENDENT OF IF YOU'RE A PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGIST, A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST OF ANY SORT, THE EVIDENCE IS CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT IF PEOPLE VOLUNTARILY THAT FACE THEM AND THE THAT THEY CAN MAKE HEADWAY AGAINST IT, AND NOT ONLY PSYCHOLOGICALLY, SO IT'S NOT ONLY MEANINGFUL TO DO THAT, PSYCHOLOGICALLY, WHICH IT IS, TO CONFRONT THE PROBLEMS THAT'S MEANINGFUL PSYCHOLOGICALLY, BUT IT'S ALSO PRACTICALLY USEFUL IN THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT BESET YOU, AND GOD ONLY KNOWS HOW I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS SPENT IN COUNTERPRODUCTIVE ACTIVITY. I'M NOT AN ABSOLUTE CYNIC ABOUT THAT, BUT WHEN I TALK TO UNDERGRADUATES, I ASK THEM HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU WASTE EVERY DAY BY YOUR OWN RECKONING, AND IT'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN I WALK THE STUDENTS THROUGH I SAID, &quot;WHY DON'T YOU VALUE AND CALCULATE FOR YOURSELF TO YOUR FUTURE BY YOUR INABILITY IT'S WORTH THINKING THROUGH.&quot; IN ANY CASE, PEOPLE DO WASTE A LOT OF TIME AND THEY ALSO ACT COUNTERPRODUCTIVELY REGARDLESS, WE DO MAKE UNDER THE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS AND WE CAN RESIST THE THAT'S WITHIN OUR POWER, AND WE DON'T KNOW THE LIMITS TO THAT. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT'S BETTER TO, WE ALL KNOW THIS, THAT IT'S BETTER TO LIVE EVERYONE KNOWS THAT. THAT'S WHAT YOU TEACH (AUDIENCE CLAPPING) AND WE KNOW THAT IT'S BETTER TO LIVE TRUTHFULLY THAN IN DECEIT, AND YOU CAN TELL THAT, TOO, BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO WHAT YOU AND WE KNOW THAT YOU SHOULD AND MOVE FORWARD, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT. IT'S PART OF OUR INTRINSIC MORAL NATURE, AND THAT NATURE IS THERE. AND IT'S NOT DIFFICULT TO EVERYONE KNOWS THAT YOU WAKE WHEN YOU'VE LET YOUR AND THAT YOU BERATE YOURSELF AND YOUR CRUELTY AND YOUR THAT ARE IN FRONT OF YOU. AND IF YOU ARE THE IN SOME SENSE THE CAPTAIN IF THERE WAS NO INTRINSIC NATURE, WELL, THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN, YOU'D JUST LET YOURSELF OFF THE HOOK. THERE'D BE NO VOICE OF BUT NO ONE ESCAPES FROM THAT, AND WHAT THAT INDICATES TO ME IS THAT, AT LEAST PSYCHOLOGICALLY, THAT'S CHARACTERIZED BY A MORAL DIMENSION, AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT WELL, AND THAT MORAL FAILINGS HAVE CONSEQUENCES, AND THAT THEY'RE NOT TRIVIAL. THEY DESTROY YOU, THEY THEY DESTROY YOUR COMMUNITY. AND YOU CAN TELL PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY KNOW. THEY DON'T KNOW THEY AND MAYBE THAT'S THE THING YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT OTHER PEOPLE KNOW THEY EMBODY, BUT THEY CAN'T ARTICULATE, AND THEY SAY, &quot;WELL, YOU HELPED THAT I ALWAYS KNEW TO BE OR THEY SAY, &quot;I'VE BEEN TRYING TO PUT SOME OF YOUR PRECEPTS INTO PRACTICE, RESPONSIBILITY BEING A MAIN ONE, VISION ANOTHER, HONESTY I AND SAYING THIS IS THE FUN FUN IS A WEAK WORD. IT'S THE REMARKABLE I HAVE PEOPLE TELL ME IT'S SO DELIGHTFUL, THAT THEY'RE IN A PRETTY DARK AND THERE'S PLENTY OF AND THEY DECIDED, WELL, A BIT OF A VISION AND TAKE AND START TELLING THE TRUTH AND PUTTING SOME EFFORT INTO SOMETHING, AND THEY COME UP AND THEY SAY, &quot;WOW, YOU CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT THREE PROMOTIONS.&quot; I HAD ONE GUY TELL ME, 15 SECONDS, HE CAME UP AFTER A TALK. HE SAID, &quot;TWO YEARS AGO, I GOT HE SAID, &quot;I OWN MY OWN HOUSE, I GOT MARRIED AND I HAVE AND THAT WAS THE WHOLE CONVERSATION. IT'S LIKE HE DECIDED. HE DECIDED HE WAS GOING SO YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT PESSIMISM THAT CONSTITUTES LET'S WELL, I THINK IT'S THE CORE IS THE TRAGIC NATURE OF THE IT'S PART OF THE CORE BUT WHAT EMERGES OUT OF IS A REMARKABLE APPRECIATION FOR WHAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE CAPABLE OF. WE ARE UNBELIEVABLY AND WE DO NOT HAVE ANY I WOULD SAY FOR THE LAST PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE BEEN AT LEAST IN PART, YOU'RE THAT'S WHAT WE TELL YOUNG PEOPLE. OH, YOU'RE OKAY THE WAY YOU ARE. AND THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAT YOU CAN TELL SOMEONE ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE MISERABLE. OH, I'M MISERABLE AND AIMLESS, AND SOMETIMES I'M SUICIDAL, AND I DON'T HAVE ANY DIRECTION IN MY LIFE. OH, YOU'RE OKAY THE WAY YOU ARE. THEY DON'T WANNA HEAR THAT. THEY WANNA HEAR, LOOK, YOU'RE, AND YOU KNOW THIS, YOU'RE USELESS. YOU HAVEN'T GOT STARTED. YOU'VE GOT 60 YEARS TO AND GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT YOU COULD BECOME. THAT MESSAGE IS SO MUCH MORE, IT'S SO FUNNY, BECAUSE BUT IT'S SO POSITIVE IN THE POTENTIAL THAT MAKES UP THE PERSON RATHER THAN THE MISERABLE ACTUALITY THAT HAPPENS TO BE MANIFESTING AND YOUNG PEOPLE RESPOND AND YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU'RE A PARENT AND YOU LOVE YOUR CHILD, WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO YOU WANT THAT TO MANIFEST ITSELF ACROSS THE COURSE OF THEIR LIFE. YOU WANT THEM TO BECOME TO SEE WHAT THEY COULD BE. WELL, AND I THINK THAT'S OF THE WEST IS THAT'S OF INDIVIDUAL BEING IN THE PROPER SENSE, IS TO CONSTANTLY NOTE THAT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT, AND TO COMMIT YOURSELF, BODY AND SOUL, TO THE ATTAINMENT OF THAT IDEAL. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A MEANING LIFE IS A SERIOUS BUSINESS. YOU'RE ALL IN. IT'S A FATAL BUSINESS, RIGHT? EVERYONE'S IN IT UP TO THEIR NECK, AND IT'S DREADFUL IN SOME SENSE, AND YOU NEED A MEANING THAT AND THAT'S TO BE FOUND IN RESPONSIBILITY. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK WELL TO OURSELVES, BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVEN'T IT'S LIKE, WELL, YOU'RE LOST, THERE'S REASONS YOU COULD GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPENED TO YOU IN YOUR LIFE. HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET OUT OF THAT? WELL, NOT BY PURSUING IMPULSIVE HAPPINESS. THAT IS NOT GOING TO WORK, NOT BY THINKING IN THE SHORT-TERM, NOT BY THINKING IN A NARROWLY BUT BY TAKING ON THE HEAVIEST THAT YOU CAN CONCEPTUALIZE AND BEAR. THAT WILL DO IT. IT'LL DO IT FOR YOU. IT'LL GIVE YOU A REASON IT'LL GIVE YOU A BALM FOR YOUR CONSCIENCE WHEN YOU WAKE UP AT NIGHT AND ASK YOURSELF WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH YOUR LIFE. IT'LL MAKE YOU A CREDIT TO AND IT'LL MAKE YOU A AND MORE THAN THAT, IT'S SAID IN GENESIS THAT EVERY PERSON IS MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD, AND THERE'S AN IDEA IN GENESIS THAT GOD IS THAT WHICH WITH TRUTH AND COURAGE. THAT'S THE LOGOS. IF WE'RE MADE IN THE THAT'S WHAT WE DO IS WE THE FUTURE, THE UNFORMED FUTURE, WE CONFRONT THAT CONSCIOUSLY, AND WE DECIDE WITH EVERY WHAT KIND OF WORLD WE'RE WE TRANSFORM THAT AND WE DO THAT AS A CONSEQUENCE AND SO IT'S NOT ONLY A MATTER AND PUTTING YOUR FAMILY TOGETHER, PUTTING YOUR COMMUNITY TOGETHER, IT'S A MATTER OF BRINGING THE WORLD IN ITS PROPER SHAPE INTO BEING. AND I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE CASE. AND I BELIEVE THAT WE ALL BELIEVE THAT. WE HOLD OURSELVES RESPONSIBLE. YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU'VE MADE BECAUSE YOU WERE SELFISH OR NARROW-MINDED OR BLIND IN SOME MANNER, THAT YOU REGARD YOURSELF AS CULPABLE. YOU COULD HAVE DONE OTHERWISE, AND NOW YOU'VE BROUGHT THAT SHOULD NOT BE THERE, AND IT'S ON YOU. WE HOLD OURSELVES AND SO WHAT THAT INDICATES WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE THE AGENTS THAT TRANSFORM THE POTENTIAL AND THAT IS A DIVINE, IF IT'S OUR CAPABILITY TO TRANSFORM WHAT IS NOT YET INTO WHAT IS. THE OTHER THING THAT HAPPENS, IN GENESIS, AND THIS IS SO IS THAT AS GOD CONDUCTS OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF HE STOPS REPEATEDLY AND AND THAT'S A MYSTERY, WHY IS IT GOOD? AND THE ANSWER IS SOMETHING LIKE, WELL, IF YOU CONDUCT YOURSELF WITH THE COURAGE THAT ENABLES YOU TO WHICH IS NO TRIVIAL MATTER, THEN WHAT YOU BRING OUT OF AND THAT SETS THE WORLD TO ME, THAT'S THE GREAT STORY OF THE WEST. THAT'S WHY WE REGARD OURSELVES AS SOVEREIGN INDIVIDUALS OF AND WE NEED TO KNOW THAT AND TO ACT PROPERLY IN THE WORLD.
