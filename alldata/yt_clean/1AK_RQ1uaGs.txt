- [Martin] That's why we have the goggles. (water splashes) So, gimme your hand here. - [Dan] Yep. - And add this one. (upbeat music) (Dan laughs) - I'm in the middle of Los in a tank, indoors, in a warehouse with 25,000 shrimp. (energetic music) Wow. I got zero. And we're gonna see how harvesting them and selling them. TransparentSea is trying to optimize the prawn-growing process. They think that by controlling they can raise them cleaner, cheaper and more sustainably TransparentSea is the brainchild of a guy named Steve Sutton, a lifetime commercial fisherman who spent years on shrimp before deciding he could right in Los Angeles. The team brings in 100,000 every three weeks, with the goal of turning them into $100,000 worth of jumbo The next step is tinkering with whether that's feed rates, filtration and current, to create the biggest, And to this point, it's really working. LA chefs are lining up to So today, I'm in Los Angeles to that can really work and create a product that is not only better for the planet, but even more delicious. Welcome to &quot;Dan Does.&quot; (upbeat music) - So this would be a box with about 12,000 shrimp in it. - Really? - Yeah. Be one of eight boxes we So we get about a hundred - [Dan] So like, eight boxes becomes- - [Steve] Around $100,000 if all goes well. - So what is actually in here? - They're actually 15-day-old, what's called post larvae. - So why don't you just make babies here? Like, why do you have to bring babies in? - So the genetics are super important. You can kind of be a penny If you don't have a good handle on the mother and father and like, how fast they can grow and how resistant they are to disease, you can end up with shrimp instead of 12 weeks to grow. And so, you lose a lot of money on that. So every three weeks We'll open it up, then they're gonna go into the nursery. - [Dan] Steve says that in they intend to hatch their own prawns, but for now they wanna get before they have their own babies. (upbeat jazzy music) From here, the team slowly drops the salinity down to the level they want it, before dumping the babies in The nursery tanks use a which is where they add carbon to create a natural, The later tanks use a where the undesirables Okay, so we are standing in front of, there are two nurseries, and each one of these nurseries will hold the prawns - [Steve] That's right. - And in three weeks, they're ready to move on the next stage. We're lucky to be here today, because today is actually transfer day. And the goal is to move to a grow tank, as fast as possible. - [Steve] Now, these ones have to move in the next day or two. So yeah, I'd say this is a good day. - All right, let's scoop 'em and move 'em. - Don't fall in. - [Dan] Down towards the ground. Oh my God, they're hopping! Oh, I feel 'em! - [Steve] You feel 'em? Let's see what you got. Now give 'em a little shake in the water to get that foam out. - So now? - Now you're gonna try and There you go, you got - [Dan] Eek! - [Steve] Just keep You got 'em. - [Dan] The trick of the transfer stage is moving all of the so that they acclimate and start eating and adjust to their new environment, all at the same time. So, for this next few hours, it's kind of a mad dash. Whoa! - [Steve] All right, so shake. Yeah, lower 'em in, turn the basket forward, and then shake on the way out. They grow a lot better in here. Takes them a couple days to get situated and then they start taking off and grow. These guys are already eating. They'll clean up the walls and eat any algae that's grown will be gone. - Okay, so what is this tank? Like, obviously it looks - Yeah. - Is that on purpose? - Yeah, so it's actually called a raceway. Basically, it's an optimal And what it does, it just creates a circular current. Water comes in at two and keeps 'em swimming. - [Dan] So it's funny like, until they hit the water they're kind of out of it. - [Steve] Yeah. - [Dan] Kind of like, asleep. And then they hit the water - [Steve] Oh yeah. Life. - [Dan] Why are we calling them prawns? Are they prawns or shrimp? - [Steve] They're technically prawns, but the market calls them white shrimp. - [Dan] Okay. - They're Pacific whiteleg - [Dan] So your goal here is to be like, the most efficient shrimp - [Steve] We wanna change a into one that's as efficient This farm is a big step. - [Dan] So let's talk about some of the elements of this tank. First is the feeder. Is this unique to you? Or is this like- - No, these are really It's just a timer with a belt. So there's a timer here and the belt just slowly creeps forward. So we come in in the morning, we fill the belt, we weigh out the feed based on And we fill the belt - It seems to me that filtration is like, the thing that you don't but that is like the and the operations that go into it, right? The next, and arguably the most important is water filtration, which are done in central locations for all the tanks in the warehouse. For the filtration, first, a drum filter to remove all the physical Then for the dissolved waste, the water is pumped into giant tanks with a plastic medium to attract the undesirables. Mastering the filtration to reuse over 95% of its water. This room is obviously really hot and it's at 86 degrees, you said? - Yeah. - And is this the kind you would try it at 90, try it at 80, just to see where you're - This shrimp's grown around the world. It's a tropical species that's from Mexico all the way down to Peru. They can survive up to 93 degrees, but they could start to have Similarly, they can go down to 65, but they're not gonna grow very much. They're gonna be very, very sluggish. So this is just their prime temperature and allows us to be much more efficient. They don't fight current, they don't fight cold everything's stable. So from here- - [Dan] They'll live and then we can go check out - Yeah, and right now we So we have the baby crop, this is our second youngest crop. It's about 30 days on the farm. We have another crop that's And another crop, six weeks ahead. - Awesome, let's go. Oh, whoa, okay, you can see that these are, so this is mid-level, midsize. - [Steve] Midsize. - What reason would you Like what are we checking on? - [Steve] Daily, we check the bottom and in order to grow, shrimp molt. So they change their shell. When they're tiny, like those little guys, they're molting every When they're this size, they're probably molting By the time they're harvest size, they're molting every two weeks. If there are too many molts they'll collect feed and - [Dan] Right. - [Steve] And if that happens, in the course of two, three days, everything will be dead. - Can we scoop some out? - Let's do it. - Why are we going to the bottom? Just- - [Steve] There's generally They do like to swim in our system. But you got some. Maybe 20, 25. - And so, very simply, like, what is your system here? - So it goes through these screens and down these six-inch pipes, into two 12-inch pipes, they go down to the actual These guys are feeding and they're active. And just like us, they respire, they use oxygen, they produce carbon dioxide. We need to take some of that out and then, it'll be pumped through some down this 12-inch pipe, into each respective tank. - [Dan] From here, I have to get a wetsuit on, so I can actually get in the tank. - All right, time to harvest. I'm gonna need you to put this on. - A suit? - Yep. (musical note sparkles) (energetic music) We're gonna harvest tank four. - How do I look? - Two, three. You look great. You look very handsome. - I really do not want to get - These guys have been on coming up on just about ready to harvest. - It is wild. Look how they all, I mean, they're huge. They're all sort of, uniform. They sort of look like they're I was sort of stalling to get in the tank with It is not something that I'm The first step is actually so we can use half of the tank to trap the shrimp in a net, which we'll eventually pull up. They're like, this is my tank. Ack! (Dan laughs) - [Steve] Yeah. You're in their world now. - [Martin] And now this and you're just gonna cinch 'em together. This is great stuff. - Like, I can feel the, you're feeling some like, attacks on my feet. - Yeah. - Why don't you wear water shoes? - We don't wear water shoes, 'cause we want to feel how the tank is. We wanna see if it's clean, if it's dirty, where the molts are and how the shrimp are doing. - So we could wear water shoes. - If you wanted to. I have Brody's if you want. - No, no, no. Come on. (Martin chuckles) I'm in it for the long haul here. I cannot tell, I mean they are, they love my feet. I'm doing good. I like it. I mean- - [Steve] You're not moving (Dan laughs) - But you always drag your feet? You're always shuffling? - Yeah, I shuffle. I usually walk on my big toes. - Okay. - We're gonna take our seine net. It's 25 feet around. And I'm gonna have you and just hug that net against the wall. And you're gonna go full - How am I doing? - [Steve] We'll find out. - When is it, it gets a little dicey - [Steve] Yep, yeah. (Dan cackles) - All right. So now we have a big O. - [Dan] Yep. (water splashes) - And my next step is getting in the O. - [Dan] Okay. - So we've probably in this seine net right now. (Dan laughs) - All right, so all this here, is our catch. - [Martin] Yes. They're all at the bottom. - [Dan] From here the goal that are caught in the net, but for today's purpose, we're just doing one quick restaurant run and the batch isn't totally ready. So we're letting a lot go We got some shrimp. - [Steve] We got some shrimp. We're gonna find out right now, Matthew's gonna sort 'em, but overall you did well. - [Dan] So that's our haul? - [Steve] That's your catch, man. - [Dan] The last step is moving the shrimp to the counting, where they'll be divided between sizes and then packaged up to go to restaurants. (upbeat music) - So we got about a little - This is 'cause you're taking This would be like 50 pounds, right? - [Steve] So normally we would to three or 400 pounds in a day. - [Dan] Mmm hmm. - [Steve] So this sorting table that we're about to use would be full. - [Dan] The shrimp are sorted into large, jumbo and actually, soft-shell shrimp, which is something that is You're selling them based on weight, so there's a cutoff where - So our target size is large, which is just an arbitrary that's around 30 grams. Anything bigger than that, we call a jumbo and we get 'em, you know, bigger than my hand. So these actually are pretty unique. - [Dan] I got one, I got one. - [Steve] He's got one. - [Dan] 25, baby! - [Steve] That's a large. - [Dan] That's some cheap. Ooh, is that a soft shell? Soft head? - [Steve] Yeah, yeah. He's on the soft. (shrimp plops) - It's so crazy that this bucket starts from those little - Yeah. And it's crazy on a full day, I mean, we'll fill that - [Dan] Yeah, I mean, these We'll get these packaged up and move 'em on to the restaurant? - Sounds good. - This is our product. - So there's your five-pound catch. We're gonna bring these but we've got the rest of (upbeat music) - Wow. That's insane. Tasting that, I feel like I'm in like, You know, off some coast (Steve laughs) - Yeah, 'cause the idea is if that's got a lot of problems- - You gotta win. You gotta have the best stuff. - We gotta make high quality stuff. - [Dan] In order for he has to have the best prawns. And I wanted to see what a So we took a batch over to the Michelin recognized Holbox. - So we got the big ones - Okay. - We wanna bring you some of - Yeah, these look great, man. I'm gonna take these inside and we're gonna make an aguachile. And see what else we can do with them. - [Steve] Good. All right. - [Dan] With shrimp of you can eat it just like that. - Good head. I mean, aguachile is a Northern The whole idea of it, it's supposed to be spicy, tangy, refreshing and simple. And you need really high-quality (knife knocks) - Were you surprised when - You know, I got the news from Steve that the project had moved to Downey. It sounded like a super (Gilberto chuckles) First, I'm like, &quot;Wait, you're gonna farm shrimp in LA? Like, the most expensive you're gonna do a shrimp farm.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Okay, well that's ambitious,&quot; but, I love the idea of having fresh shrimp I mean, that's wild. Well, shrimp is gonna be one of the easiest things to source. It's actually been the (blender whirs) (energetic music) - [Gilberto] Cheers. - [Dan] Cheers. - [Steve] Oh, yeah. Tangy, a little spice. - [Dan] These little things were hitting me in the leg today. This is (beep) incredible. It's so crazy to me because to me like, this is the balance of like, art and technology. - Summer's gonna be good. - I hope so, man. People are calling. - [Dan] After seeing reacted to the product and I thought, this could really And that's exciting there could be hundreds of providing all kinds of not just to restaurants, And it seems like that would both, improve our food systems and give people access to a healthier, more delicious product. - But, it's really about if we can get everybody to kind of win, the beauty of it, it's driven by the people who - Sure. - Yeah. - If they make the choice to pay more for something that's sustainable, and he's conveying well and his servers know what to say, he cooks the product beautifully, I mean, it's kind of how it has to be. - Hmm. - Amazing. Well, thank you so much. And, thank you. - You got it. (hands slap) Greasy shrimp hand. - No, it's okay.
