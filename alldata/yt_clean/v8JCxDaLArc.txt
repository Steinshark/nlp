-The air force is working. -We have the coordinates for you. -Oh, a screenshot. -Accompany. What's that? -It's a hit. -Oh, you're giving them a hard time with your mortar. -Where is it? [ENEMY ARTILLERY FIRING POSITION SPOTTED.] [ENEMY ARTILLERY FIRING POSITION SPOTTED.] [MORNING. SOMEWHERE NEAR THE BAKHMUT.] -Good. We almost forgot the coffee. -Yes, take a special thermos. -So, let's talk about the plan. We go to the houses, take off. If it's bad, we'll decide to change our position. -The glorious city of Bakhmut. What's painted there? -A happy family. A child, a father, a mother and a son. -Over there in the corner. A free corner, a good one. That one. -All right, Tor, we take everything out. Let's put the communications into position. [LEGUNDA.] [LEGUNDA.] [LEGUNDA.] -The 120 is constantly working on water pumping as standard. They walk around here like locals. -They have a tank ditch here. -A ditch, yes. It's our ditch, but they're using it... It's not dug and they're sitting here. They walk around the landing. -We're going to do a reconnaissance overview of the panorama. To do this, we will raise the M300, it has a better camera. I understand the task, we are performing it. The wind is moderate, the pilot is comfortable to work. -Zhora, Shchuka just told me that they found the target. [TARGET FOUND. ENEMY BBM] [TARGET FOUND. ENEMY BBM] [TARGET FOUND. ENEMY BBM] Okay, now targeting.Targeting. Focus on the target. -Now we're trying to identify it. We're also calculating the coordinates. If we can target on it now. Is okay? -Focusing. -Look, friends. When... you run there calmly. Pasha reaches the corner and stands with the remote control. -We determined the coordinates for you. Work with our coordinates. The target is poorly identified. I would define it as secondary. If we have the means, let's hit it as usual. [AN ENEMY AIRCRAFT LAUNCHED A MISSILE ATTACK ON THE BAKHMUT.] -Aviation is hitting hard. -Pavlo Yuriyovych, are you the one who is hitting with the air force? -Accompany, what is it? -Zhora, accompany. Show me. If such an event occurs, observe and accompany. [A PAIR OF ENEMY PLANES ON PATROL.] [A PAIR OF ENEMY PLANES ON PATROL.] [A PAIR OF ENEMY PLANES ON PATROL.] -The silhouette of the vehicle say correctly. -Good. Front line overview, the task now. On the next battery we'll do a panoramic. It's a reconnaissance flight. [ENEMY INFANTRY DIGGING IN] -Did you take a screenshot, Zhora? Did you take a screenshot? -We have to report. -...they were supposed to enter after that, but if they didn't get there... Screenshot, determine the coordinates. Is there infantry? -Yes. -Send it and get focusing. -Hello, yes, Shchuka. We are watching the infantry. Take a look, please. Confirm it's not ours. We're going to focus. I'm looking at the map, but it shouldn't be ours. -I started horizontal communication with the mortar team. Now we will fire at the area of our interest, at the water pumping station. The mortar is throwing one mine, accept. -Cancel, cancel. -There was a hit nearby. -Plus. How close is it? -About 40 meters. -The mortar's not working, it's suppressed. I'm going to give to my fighters some coffee so they don't die of frostbite. -I saw the artillery firing. [ENEMY ARTILLERY IS FIRING ON THE BAKHMUT.] [ENEMY ARTILLERY IS FIRING ON THE BAKHMUT.] To the left of the cross, that's the shot. The white cloud. -That's the artillery working. [POSITION UNDER FIRE. TAKE SHELTER]. -Medic, medic, medic. -Hurry up! -Run, run, run. -Come on, put it down, put it down. Come on, get on the floor. The other side. -Shh, shh. -Oh, my God. -Faster, faster. Call for emergency. -Faster, faster. -Sveta, I'm going to get the documents. -Honey. -Yes. No, it's just a small child. -Civilian. -It's okay, it's okay. Mommy, you're doing great. -Yes, we have doctors checking him now. We need to take him to the hospital. Yes? -You're doing great. It's okay, you hear? -We have a hit in the yard. We're suppressed, we can't work. -Where to cut? -Get the scissors. [WE HAVE WAITED OUT THE SHELLING. WE CONTINUE TO WORK.] -The lights inside the car are blown out. [WE HAVE WAITED OUT THE SHELLING. WE CONTINUE TO WORK.] -Yes? [WE HAVE WAITED OUT THE SHELLING. WE CONTINUE TO WORK.]. -Start it up and check it out. -It's okay. -Did you start it? -Start it up, check it out. -Ready. Take off. Zhora, look. They'll show us the viewpoint we need. [ADJUSTING THE MORTAR FOR ENEMY POSITIONS.] [ADJUSTING THE MORTAR FOR ENEMY POSITIONS.] [ADJUSTING THE MORTAR FOR ENEMY POSITIONS.] [ADJUSTING THE MORTAR FOR ENEMY POSITIONS.] -Further, further, further. -Scope 433. -Let's throw them into the trench there. Let's focusing. -Good, look. We can take one more shot maximum, if it is not too long. We're not taking any risks right nowb because of batteries. --That's right. -Hit. -Right in the center of the house. -Repeat the same one. -Do you have 30 seconds, Pasha? -Tell them to repeat it quickly. -Zoom in good, so I can see it. More, more. -It fell behind the house. -We're landing. Done? Did you finish shooting? -Yes, let's change the road. -That one, the water pumping station, there's a road near it, they were running along it. Here, look. The idea is that they are from a tank ditch, they are walking here. Well, look, we can throw it or not. So that we could coordinate. Where? You've hit it here, right? -Yes. -All right, then, wait. The guys are going to hit the ditch, and if there's any movement here, let me know. -In the road. -We are now adjusting two 120 mortars on the water pump and the tank ditch. -Careful. -Where? There, yes? -In front of us, here. -They shoot at us, landing. -Here, here, here. Come on. Here. -Have you lost connection? -Well, then we can work for a while. [ENEMY ARTILLERY POSITION SPOTTED.] [ENEMY ARTILLERY POSITION SPOTTED.] -Straight ahead to the east. -There are two of them. -Yes. I see the second shot near the first. -Aviation? -Where is it? -It's a little south of where we drew the troops today. -So they hit their own troops? Let's hit on that artillery. -Did you focusing? Good. we won't be able to work on them, but we need these points where they work. -I understand. I need them also for further counter-battery work. [CONTINUING TO ADJUST THE MORTAR.] -One mine, fire. -We don't see them anymore. Where are they? -It hit a trench. -It entered the trench. A flash? What was it? -There was a flash and a blip. -Something small. There's smoke coming out. -Oh, great, great, right there. -What are these? Secondaries. -But it came this way, over there. In short, this guy has not changed his position, guys. He's dead. -He's dead? -What's this? -Yes. That's the AGS shooting. -Do you want to fly it? -And there's one battery? -It doesn't look like it's on. Oh, damn it, it's on. It's beautiful and huge. -We need to hit the hangar. [COMMUNICATION WITH THE DRONE IS SUPPRESSED BY THE ENEMY ELECTRONIC WARFARE.] -Pavlo, work carefully. It could be an Electronic Warfare, if the satellites have fallen. -Do you have a connection, Pasha? -Let's go. I will come, take a piece of paper and start writing about the tactics of using UAVs, ours. I want us to stick to it at all times. -Friends, I'd like your attention for a minute. My call sign is Abdula. I am the commander of the TERRA unit. We are currently fundraising to provide a second TERRA unit. We have created it because we do not have enough groups to work in the Bakhmut direction. Part of the money has already been raised, perhaps a third part has already been raised. The rest still needs to be fundraised. I ask you to help us with this. Thank you in advance. Glory to Ukraine! The link to the fundraising will be fixed in the description of the video. We also have a Patreon page. Please subscribe to it.
