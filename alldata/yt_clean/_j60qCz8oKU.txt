Burcu: This place is amazing. Burcu: The view from the bedroom is going to be stunning. Ozgur: It's coming. Burcu: The rain is coming. Ozgur: Is it okay? Burcu: Can you see the lake? Burcu: Wow, this place is gorgeous. Burcu: Wow, it's so beautiful. Burcu: The tent's position is perfect right now. Ozgur: Oh, that's great. Ozgur: Hold it, honey, and pull it that way. Pull, pull. Ozgur: Let me see. Ozgur: The window? Yeah, that's right. Burcu: Yeah, hold it. Burcu: Alright. Burcu: We closed it just in time. Burcu: It's really picking up now. Burcu: Okay. Burcu: Let's move the stuff from here. Ozgur: I wonder how I'll get the stove now. Burcu: It's all wet inside. Burcu: You could take a shower if you want. It's raining that hard. Ozgur: Look at that steam. Ozgur: See how it's rising from the grass. Burcu: Steam is coming off the lake, too. Burcu: The ground is so warm. Ozgur: Yeah. Ozgur: I still need to put up the sign. Burcu: Wait for the rain to stop, then you can do it. Ozgur: Doesn't look like it's going to stop... Burcu: Now I can knead with my hands. Ozgur: What are you making today? Burcu: Pizza. Burcu: Yeah. Burcu: Okay, the dough is ready. Burcu: Look, I did a test run. Ozgur: It's not cooked yet. Burcu: It's like a pastry. Burcu: Yeah, it's not cooked yet. Burcu: If I roll it out this size, it'll be enough. Burcu: The dough is so soft, it's perfect. Ozgur: You decide where to put it. Burcu: Actually, a bit more towards the table... Burcu: Okay. Burcu: It's almost done. Ozgur: Is it ready? Ozgur: It smells so good. Burcu: It smells just like a pizzeria. Burcu: Wow. Burcu: So the ingredients don't dry out. Okay. Burcu: This one is overcooked. Ozgur: But it looks good. Ozgur: I'm going to taste it. Ozgur: Take a bite. Burcu: Let me see. The bottom isn't burnt, right? Burcu: Yeah. Ozgur: I'm going to put some onions on mine. Burcu: The second ones always turn out better. Burcu: The bottom is perfectly cooked. Burcu: Ozgur's challange with mozzarella. Burcu: It's coming in hot, right? Burcu: I know. Ozgur: I'll make another one. Burcu: Then we can start our movie. Burcu: Do you think we'll be able to hear the movie over the rain? Ozgur: This is great. Burcu: We'll sleep nice and cozy. Burcu: It's so warm in here right now. Burcu: We'll watch the movie from here. Ozgur: Oh, it's so warm. Ozgur: The sound is better here, too. Ozgur: Good night. Burcu: Good night. Ozgur: How'd you sleep? Comfortable? Burcu: Yeah, it was so warm. Ozgur: Ah... Ozgur: The ground is so soft... Burcu: Clouds are coming from the other side. Ozgur: They're coming, but the ground is soft... Ozgur: The wind must've knocked it down. Burcu: At least it won't rain anymore. Ozgur: Yeah. Burcu: Thanks to that, I slept so warm last night. Ozgur: Let me put this here. Ozgur: Good, we've got plenty of fuel left. Burcu: The water should be warm now, should we wash our faces? Ozgur: It's warm. Burcu: Oh, it's perfect now. Come on. Ozgur: Put it down, let it warm up. Burcu: We can make coffee on this. Ozgur: Yeah. Burcu: If you want, you can turn it down a bit. Ozgur: The gas is still a quarter full. Ozgur: They used to make us draw landscape pictures in school. Just like this. Burcu: It's so beautiful. There are cows over there. Burcu: You know, I'm used to coffee now. Ozgur: It's even better when it's hot like this. Burcu: I like it the other way too, when the milk is cold. Burcu: Do you want some almonds? Ozgur: Okay. Burcu: Wanna go towards the water? Are your shoes suitable? Burcu: I'm wearing my boots. Ozgur: You can't go far anyway. There's grass. Burcu: Since the wind has stopped... Burcu: Yeah. Ozgur: Take a deep breath. Burcu: You could step onto the water any second. Burcu: Ah, those plants over there look so different. Ozgur: This is the boundary. Burcu: The water starts right here. Burcu: The whole lake is surrounded by these plants. Ozgur: I wonder if you can eat these? Burcu: They look so pretty. Ozgur: Ah, this one is hollow. Burcu: Reeds. Are they reeds? Ozgur: Can you make a whistle out of this? Ozgur: Nope. Ozgur: Could be a cane. Burcu: It's so beautiful, look. Burcu: Should I prepare breakfast? Ozgur: Okay. Burcu: I'm making asparagus. Burcu: Did you burn your hand? Burcu: There are gloves behind you. Burcu: Asparagus for breakfast, lunch, and dinner... Burcu: Next time, I'll make asparagus pizza. Ozgur: Let's see how that turns out.
