And that's how the videos go. -We just run into what we run into. Take care, boss. All the best. -Hey, bro. You have a dollar? We don't have cash, man. That's bullsh*t. All right, we're jumping in. [Hawk speaking Apache] [Peter] Okay, so... [Apache] Hawk, this is your bro in the back? This is Randy Hawkins, call him Randy Boy. -Okay, Randy. -[Hawk] Yeah! -Oh, you got the full tat on there, okay. -You gonna chill in the back? Okay. -Hawk, let's go. [Hawk laughs] [Peter] Take care. That's interesting. So he doesn't want free stuff -[laughing] I know. -Characters, man. So Hawk, this is the full monty tour. This is no North Korean tour -You know what the North Korean tour is? Where they make everything look perfect and bring everyone to the nicest hotels No... [laughs] No. I'm just gonna give it to you raw, man. That's what we're gonna start off with. -That's my style. I like the truth, Hawk. He's just gonna cruise in the back, huh? -He's used to it. [Peter yells] Randy, how's it going? Oh nice, look at that. So for a while, this was one of our and source of income for the tribe. Which was the FATCO. Which stands for -See now it's kinda closed down. But part of it's still running. I may be wrong but I think that's still open in Eastern Arizona. -So it has some jobs here? -Okay. Particularly during this is one of the biggest -So it used to employ a lot of people? So as that guy was saying, -Yeah, I think probably -Okay. -Right, lot of walking here. -Super dad? [Hawk] This is another area My brother works here as a mechanic. Randy works here? -My older brother works there, yeah. So we have a cement company. -You do research, right? In Phoenix? -Yeah, research. -Mostly medical. This is our local bar here. -Can we cruise in? -Is it still open? It's Saturday morning, what, 11:00? 11:00, and I think it opens at 10:00. -Okay, so it's not a dry res obviously? You walk in there and purchase it at -Okay, so you buy your booze there No, we used to have one of that Used to be called Apache Flames. -Okay, so that's the alcohol store? -Hey Randy boy. [Apache] -So you guys speak Apache together? So you and your family only speak Apache? -Yeah. -A lot of Natives lose their language. We're losing it pretty quick. Randy's one of the few his age but after that it's pretty much I think a lot of it has to do Generations and generations and then later on they... Kind of embarrassed We're losing our tradition quickly, losing a lot of our culture, You didn't go to boarding school I went to boarding school. -Okay. Very strict. The same thing but I think it was more stricter So we couldn't watch -Okay. -So super conservative? Now you say boarding school, Yeah, Natives from all over. Or was it White guys? -It was only Natives? -So they still have that? They closed it because one of This is where Randy Boy's friend Randy's friend was murdered? -Two days ago. Yeah, I think he was stabbed -For what? I think he was walking through here and-- -Is it that dangerous back here? Yeah, I think at night especially with Intermixing both of them together -Okay, has that hit the res hard here? Like back in, I think We actually became the murder capital Which was like seven per thousand. I think nationally they're five I'm not trying to degrade my tribe, But it's... I mean apart from it's gotten better than those days? -It's getting worse I think. Because a lot of the kids, now they're raising kids and they're not being advised, or no guidance. So it's just kinda getting worse. And they don't speak their language. -No self-identity I guess is a big thing. And so that guy He's like, &quot;I want a job.&quot;, -He's on something. -So then that's the problem, right? Like even if there was a job, And then I've seen it through and through, you give someone and they're not working, and nicer cars. Like that doesn't fix the problem. -I guess priority is a big thing too. One thing that my dad taught me -Mm-hmm. -At a young age I didn't value when I was young but as I've gotten older, now I understand that he was teaching me To look ahead, pretty much. -Mm-hmm. Kinda use your head. Think about the consequences but how it's gonna also -There used to be a trading post here. -Back from the day? This is what they considered -Jack's Trading Post? And it closed I think back in the '80s. You were able to buy food -So then eventually pay that credit off. And right by there a little bit more, Used to buy cakes, bread, -So is it fair to say Yeah, definitely. Mostly '80s, there was kind of like -Okay. And so every reservation Like if you go to they're all, from my understanding, Yep. Or Cherokee in North Carolina, If you go to Pine Ridge, South Dakota, -And how do you say the geographic? Where, how much... If we can actually put it together [Peter] So this is your -They all have different names One Step Beyond, Smurfville. So this is called Upper East Fork now. Be careful 'cause this is a wake, man. You can record it. This lady that passed -A big tent. -Okay. But as I can see there, ton of cars. -Strong community? Or depends the family you're in? Depends on the family Like she was very well respected living That's the community building right there. -Community building? -So this is where you grew up? There's my mom right there. -Oh, cool. -How you doing back there, Randy? -This is a nice little zone. [Hawk speaking Apache] She even put on [Peter] Oh, beautiful dress. -Nice to meet you. -Your name? Andrena, okay, Peter. -Traditional dress? I made this one. -You made it? Nice. -I wear to church and then where -Okay. -And so you raised Hawk here and Randy? Four, and then two adopted girls. The last one, the two girls 'cause their mom was alcoholic They were having a good marriage The mom start running around -Okay. -So you adopted those girls? And their father the same too. His wife, she and start So they end up with their life. So I end up with those two girls. -Jut because you wanted to help? That's a noble cause. [Peter] American flag, [Hawk] Yeah, he volunteered -He volunteered? Back in the '50s President Eisenhower implemented a federal program and that was to actually move to assimilate them -Yeah, yeah. So that was later kinda renamed So my dad actually signed up for Not shipped but assigned to San Francisco. So that's why if you think about it Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, Phoenix. -Oakland too, a lot went to Oakland. I met some guys on Lakota that Yeah, so that program and then hopefully not return and to assimilate So eventually they wanted -Grab the land? Oh. -You drew that? Nice. Nice, Randy. [Andrena] You wanna see [Randy] Championship basketball. -You dunk, Randy? Can you dunk it? [Andrena] I have zucchini, If the zucchini and pumpkin come out [Hawk] Contest, yeah. -You grow some good vegetables? -The best in town? [laughing] -So your the best -Yeah. -This is... Okay, I've only been -Uh-huh. You know when you're in -...you're trying to feel what it is? There's something very powerful -Really? I always pray. What's that? We always pray in the morning, Are you religious? Like you're Christian -I go to Lutheran. But I still have like tradition, you know? Prayer in Apache. That's why probably... Pray for my house, my neighbors and everybody around. So this is a good place. -What was it like for you growing up here? -It's good. I liked it. Way back, everything was hard. Nowadays we have water in the house. Everything, stove and build Bed on this side, no mattress, -Straw. -Straw under it and put the tar on it Kinda make it soft. And you would always live About five, six miles, my grandpa put a saddle on that mule. White mule and I used to sit behind him and by 4:00 he would be and then I'll sit behind him, To the house over there. I went to school at beginner, When you get to fourth So I learned a lot of things. How to clean, take a shower. Kinda naughty. And there's this lady, her name Mrs. Wat. I always say Andrena [laughs] You said you were naughty? Yeah? Now I look back, probably. [laughter] And then we used to go &quot;This week you're not going &quot;You're gonna scrub the wall and...&quot; We used to do that. -You got into trouble a lot? -I was naughty. [laughing] -I think everybody does that. What about this one? Was he playing the death metal -[laughing] Dad always get after him. -What do you think of his music? -She didn't like it. [laughs] No, I don't know what kind of music... I never... I don't hear the words. -So might not even call it music, right? Screaming? -It started from down there, -Oh, is that where the band started? Anything I should know about your son -[laughing] -He was a good boy? -Yeah, right. I even went to captain's mass when I was in the navy. -How many years in the navy? Oh, okay, so here's a story. Hawk was telling me one day saying he was gonna get some things and then he came back Yeah. -How was that? One day I went straight And then I was just waiting, He was only 17 when he, you know... -Joined the navy. I finished my high school to send me to boot camp the next day I was begging and begging and the closest they could do So I had to wait two weeks Joined... Went to boot camp at San Diego. And we have to wait for then... We have big dinner, I used to cry lying down on the bed. And then Alvina used to say, He's not a baby. He's growing up man. Was telling me that. -And then at that time you would have -'Cause that would've meant he's around. That was cool. -That was really interesting. So we couldn't put that on the camera but Andrena gave us Protection. That was an interesting ritual Yeah. And the placement in the circles -Thank you for bringing me into that. I want you to be protected, you know? -So that's what that was for? -For riding around the tribe today? -Even just meeting people. So you can... People have good intention, bad intention. I don't want you to follow it Interesting, so every person Yeah, you gotta kinda be careful. -They can rub their energy on you? You know the term energy vampire? -Yeah. -When you're around someone for a while, afterwards you feel like -You're energetically-- I can already tell -When I leave I'm fired up, right? -Yeah. -So there's two types, -So that's what this does sorta?

I don't care about getting new shoes I don't care about that. My thing is just surviving for my kids. There's a certain age where you hit and you just have to really watch out. -That's when you... overprotective I guess. -Yeah, yeah. So with men here, your teenage daughters but like the dating, you want them to find or do you want them to leave, That's a hard question for me. The first one she met, The wife was happy with that one. [laughs] -Okay, why is that? Because it's foreign. People like different things. They don't want to Just being ressed out I guess, yeah. That's a term they use around here. I'm kinda real strict, you know? -You don't see beer cans here. I'm not into meth stuff Fentanyl's around here now. -Is it pretty bad? It's... I don't know.

My great-grandfather was in the military and he said he was there Which I didn't know -'Cause you guys worked with the cavalry? Yeah, yeah, yeah. My grandfather was a scout, yeah. -Okay, so I read that's why because you had a better relationship -With the US Army, right? The medicine men saw they were coming. -They knew what was gonna-- No, no, when the cavalry was coming there was Geronimo and then the army and destroy our crops So they were prepared. So when the army came up there to raid So they negotiated. So that's how that became Camp Apache. -So there was no No. -No? Okay. So sort of like the Crow? Yeah... I don't know about the Crow. -Crow worked with the US Army. What was it like growing up here? I'd say it was a great place This river's what we survive on. I was riding donkeys in the mountains Then from horses to bike, now here we are. -You're not even that old. -Nah. -So you started on donkeys? I started riding a donkey Big brothers would put us on the donkey We'd cry and chicken-out but they'd This how today these young kids -They're into rodeos out here? -Oh, nice. Your first language is English or Apache? Usually I started on Apache. You have like a little Irish [laughs] You part Irish? -Nah. If you go to, I was told, My late mother said it I think she said it was named She said there was a big bulletin board, with his picture sitting on a horse And these people that were in the military were down in Fort Huachuca, -Do you love living here on the res? Can you imagine living anywhere else? No, I don't think so. I don't think so. You're not moving to Phoenix anytime soon? I've been to Phoenix, I don't like being in crowds, so to speak. -Look at this, it's so green here. -I'm surprised how green it is here. If you want to have a drink. -Oh, yeah. [men speaking Apache] [Peter] Why am I the only one I drank some. [laughing] Is this what happens? Is this the story, Hawk? [laughing continues] It turns really dark soon. [laughing] [Peter] Geronimo's Cave? [Randy] There's a path up this way. Geronimo used to hide out in here and in the winter and that one, and in the middle there's a waterfall. -Geronimo was a medicine man wasn't he? He was like a coyote my mom said. He was like a coyote, and he used to take off to San Carlos, in 45 minutes he was in Phoenix. There's a way right here. [Hawk] Naw, I'm good, dude. -[Peter] You wanna do it, Randy? -All right, you wanna do it? -[Hawk laughs] [Peter] You all right to hike right now? -Yeah, I'm good. This is the way. I always go up there. I used to play here when I was young. -Oh yeah? What do you know about Geronimo, Randy? -I heard he was a scary man. He started warfare and his family And so he started a warpath. When they heard Geronimo's coming, everybody used to hide. After his kids and his family -He killed a lot of people out here? -We have to go this way. -Yeah, go. We have to go that way. -All right. -Go slowly. [Peter grunts] -Yeah, that's how Geronimo [exhales] I don't know -Oh, there's a rope. -That's his cave? -You're not coming up. No, don't worry about it. -All right, bud. [Peter breathing heavily] All right. That's the cave. Geronimo's Cave. Freezing air coming out of here. [panting] I'm not going in though. Not doing that. Need to read more up on Geronimo. Fierce warrior, medicine man, killed a lot of locals. But I'm no historian on this front As you can see, we've just gone already into the pine trees, and today we're gonna get 11,400 feet I believe. Second highest peak in Arizona exists [rocks crumbling] Oh, that was great. -The only injury. -Little cactus to the hand. [Randy] It goes all around every hole. You can come out from every hole. -Oh, wow. [Peter] Okay, a little pit stop for Randy. [Hawk] Pit stop for Randy, man. [voices echoing from inside] [Hawk speaking Apache] I'm gonna treat Randy to the beers -I appreciate it, man. Yeah, buddy. You want some M&amp;M's, Randy? -I'm good. I'm gonna ride in the back. [grunts] -So your bro drinks a good bit? You have a hangover you kinda just... You know how it goes, man, It's been a while, but yeah. I can't imagine having a hangover now. Especially with the cheap liquor [Peter] Okay, so coming back into town. -That's huge runway. Who's flying in here? I think they use that Sometimes celebrities go hunting up here. So they fly in. -Okay. -George Strait and others, They would fly in Some of these houses, they're rental. So people move in and rent pretty much. -Okay, but if you're not then you can get government assistance, -Exactly. -I got on the White Mountain Apache There's actually a page on -Which I found odd. -Something you'd wanna promote... ...onto the population. I don't have the best ideas Like you paid off your house You wanna borrow money against it Seems off, right? -Yeah, kinda crazy. I probably need to -Yeah, I can't speak credibly but I just saw it on their website. Okay, so growing up, these streets, you were constantly cruising through -Yeah, Randy Boy mostly. Kind of like stayed out of this place. -All right, Randy knows -Yep. [Randy speaking inaudibly] [Peter] He came back to life, huh? It's gonna get more interesting soon. -Okay. This place is called another world. -Where we're at. Yeah, and this is where Section 4 is at. -Section 4? We were at 8 while ago. Right now we're at 'nother world. And then when we head up that way -What's going on out here? Out here there's Scary out here. I don't hang out here. -Scary out here? Why? -Juggalos. -Lot of crime? Like they don't have no father, They don't get taught or anything. -Their faces are painted as clowns. -Okay, but to be fair, -Yeah, and they don't-- Yeah, there's a lot of people they found -Okay -This is called another world right here. -So is this sort of -Yeah. -Right here? I don't roam around here. -You like cruising around here with us? You feel safe with me in the car? -I ain't scared. [laughing] -Yeah, this is where... -This is where-- [laughing] Got Mr. Clean by your side. This is where the kids are at. -The kids? Right there, DS. That's a gang right there. They tag up DS, Dark Side. They pray to the devil. -So cruising around during the day though... 'Cause that's where a lot of elders... -Bengay? -You call the neighborhood Bengay? It smells like Bengay they say supposedly. [Peter] So how does Bengay I don't know, man. Probably separate 'cause they're elders. Just keeping the elder there so... And right here is Lifesaver. -This is Lifesaver. -So hoods change very quickly here? -Okay. -Little better off, huh? So these houses are rented -So why are all these homes boarded up? [Randy] They're doing meth inside. -They're doing meth and they have to-- -That's why they boarded up. -They have to shut 'em down, huh? And some of them sleep -Okay. -Behind the trees and everywhere. -So you guys grew up Actually this is where my... Father used to live here -This one. -From since I was born until 1980. '79, '80, then we moved to but it was totally different. There were like really nice yards. Yards were green grass, you know, so... -No one's really taking care of things? -Okay, why is that do you think? -Um... I think-- I think the change for me, what we were talking about earlier is You know, people aren't taught... take care of things or just even work. Put in work. Like kids are taken care of. They don't work for things as hard -So whose fault is it? -Parent's fault. It's kinda creepy to me because the graveyard's right -The graveyard's back there? -Is that creepy for you guys? Like traditional is you don't... -You don't live near the graveyard? This is the high school. -So that looks pretty good. So they have some pretty good -I think like senior league People play baseball a lot around here. -Oh, that's cool to see. [Peter] So maybe it's... Correct me where I'm wrong, You can raise your kid, get 'em into the outdoors, go up to the mountains skiing, or crime and... -Yeah, gangs, drugs, alcohol. -There's just two ways to do it. -What was this? So across the way we came from, and this was where the bar So it was so close disagreed with the location to where the current bar is located. -Okay. Are there any bars on the res? This one used to be an old bar. -This was called Apache Flame. Yep, it used to be Apache Flames. So that's where-- -Apache Flames? -Some wild nights in there? My mom, I wish you woulda [laughing] Apache Flames, dude. They used to have swinging doors in there That's really a bar. -So no more bars? A lot of crime and murders, So eventually, it's weird, they became [Hawk] Civic center for the town. John Wayne, Muhammad Ali, -In the civic center? -And it's closed down. And right there was basketball, But it's kinda gotten old So they don't use it anymore. -Right. -[ball bouncing] -[chain swishes] [ball bounces] [thump and swish] Oh, he uses the backboard. -[swishes] [Randy] I'm a baller. That's after a tallboy. [Hawk laughs] [all laughing] [Peter] Wow. Geez, what a shot he's got. Just came in, got a lot of net [Randy] Yep. I told them all to snap your wrist. My gang is [Apache], Apache Crip but he came a Christian. -Your gang leader? I'm a Crip. -But are you still a Crip? -I'm neutral now. I can wear any clothes I want, Nobody don't say nothing to me but back in the day if I was wearing red -So you had Bloods and Crips [Hawk] Yeah, he's pretty familiar So this is Blood's territory, -This guy's in the Bloods right here?

[Hawk] When I was growing up called Boys and Girls Camp They would send the boys In the meantime, and spend two weeks down there. So the first thing they'd do you meet up at the basketball court, everybody'd be doing jumping jacks. They would make us run You know, it'd be a mile, then We hear the bell ring again we'd have to be in line to get ready You know, go into the cafeteria to eat. Once we were done with that They always had a contest After that we would have an elder speaker and he would talk to us about culture or some special speaker But it was a really good program After the two weeks was done and that would pretty much go whatever was needed pretty much. -Do you think they still do that? It was a different time, you know? -Well this is exactly the reason why Yep, mm-hmm. -Drug use and all that stuff, and everyone's doing stuff around you.
