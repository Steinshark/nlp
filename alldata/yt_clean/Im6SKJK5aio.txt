- You know it's the holidays because the stores are filled with tins of overpriced confections, It's never as good as because Lan's gonna show us - Bridget, we're gonna make that's way better than and it's a ton of fun to make and to give. - [Bridget] Great. - So we're gonna get started in a medium sauce pan. I've got eight tablespoons - [Bridget] Mhm. - [Lan] Along with a half a cup of water. I'm gonna turn this to medium high. Butter's really important for toffee. It contributes some of that multi-butterscotchy complexity. The water's here to of the sugar dissolves before it caramelizes. Butter's all melted. Let's get the rest of the ingredients in. I've got a cup of granulated sugar here. It's gonna go right in. There's not really any need to stir, that sugar will slowly melt. - To that, I'm adding three - [ Bridget] Mm. - [Lan] And 1/4 teaspoon of table salt. I'm just gonna let this come to a boil. What I'm looking for is for and then you'll see it's It'll become a pale golden brown, and that takes 10 to 14 minutes. At that point, I'm gonna lower the heat. - [Bridget] Okay, great. - Bridget, you can see that it's starting to pick up color. I'm gonna turn the heat down because it goes pretty fast at this point. And I'm gonna swirl the pan to make sure that I'm getting an accurate reading on the color and the temperature. What I want to do is to make where it'll set up and be brittle. The temperature I need to nail for that is anywhere between 350 and 360 degrees. - [Bridget] Okay. - So while we're checking the temperature, I'm just gonna keep swirling the pan. I'll tilt the pot to make sure that I'm not temping So just under 360, I wanna - Yes. - So that it doesn't get any darker. And to that, I'm adding a half a cup of chopped toasted pecans. - [Bridget] Mmm. - [Lan] Just gonna stir that in. The nuts are gonna cool this a little bit to kind of stop the cooking. I've got a foil lined 13-by-9 pan, and it's been lightly greased. I'm just gonna transfer this toffee. Now, it'll set up fairly quickly, and I'm not worried about into the corners because we're gonna add some - [Bridget] Right. - So we're gonna let this cool. That's gonna take about 30 - Okay! - The toffee is set. Let's get some chocolate on here. - Okay. - [Lan] I can't just melt this It won't set up properly, and it'll melt in our hands, What I'm gonna do is take my I'm gonna melt it very to two minutes, and I'm gonna stop and stir it pretty frequently, - [Bridget] Okay. - So the reason I'm doing this is I want to very gently so it keeps its crystal (microwave beeps) - [Lan] You can see it's on the bottom. It's really important to stir so that we don't get And I'm just looking for I'm not trying to get it - Okay. (microwave starts) - [Lan] So this looks great. Do you mind pouring in the That's another ounce of finely chopped chocolate. - [Bridget] And we're using - Yeah, I like a semi-sweet for this. It's got some complexity to it. Look at that. - [Bridget] Ooh. - [Lan] Nice and smooth. - [Bridget] Very silky. - I'm going to scrape this over the toffee and just spread it with, I like to use an offset spatula for this. Just makes it a little - [Bridget] It's just - Yeah, just a thin coating. But don't worry, we're gonna Plenty of chocolate. Now that this is smooth, I'm I've got a half a cup If you have walnuts, I'm just looking for some nice coverage. The little bits of dust that you get, they look great on here too. I don't worry about that. Now that the pecans are of the chocolate, this needs that in the fridge and This has set up nicely. - [Bridget] Yes. - So we're gonna use that sling to get it out of this pan. Oh, lovely. - [Bridget] Great. Now we just need to get some chocolate and nuts on this side. I have more chocolate that to make sure it keeps its temper. I'm just gonna spread it over the top. This is another four ounces of semi-Sweet. We'll spread this out. - [Bridget] And the side is because it was on the bottom of the pan. Oh, look at that. Did you (laughs) - [Lan] I mean I guess, - [Bridget] You're doing a great job. - [Lan] If this gig blows up - So last half cup of - [Bridget] Oh, lovely. - [Lan] And I'll pop for another 15 minutes for that second side to set up. - [Bridget] Great. - All right, here's the most We get to break this up into squares now that the chocolate has set. - You mean it's eating time? - Yeah. (laughs) - We're gonna pretend like we're gonna give this away, right? - Right, exactly. - [Lan] So I like to just pick it up and give it a nice snap. - [Bridget] That breaks lovely. - And I'm just shooting for rough squares, we'll say. Any ones that I don't manage to break into squares, - Remove the evidence. - Yes. - This is pretty thin, so which also means bites really nicely. - [Bridget] Fantastic. - [Lan] You wanna have a taste? - [Bridget] Yes, please. I'm gonna take this one. - [Lan] I'm going for a big one. - [Bridget] It's lighter than air. - Mmmm. - Super snappy chocolate. - [Lan] Nice, rich, buttery flavor. The salt comes through, - [Bridget] And that layer It is so thin. Each veneer you have that impossible salted toffee layer that's really crisp in there too. It almost reminds me of honeycomb. - We hope you enjoyed this video as much as we enjoyed making it. - Don't forget to hit that like button and subscribe to our channel. - And if you're ready to take your cooking to the next level, head over to Americastestkitchen.com and get a free all - While you're there, you can sign up for our free email newsletters and download our app. - With unlimited access to over 14,000 of our test kitchen recipes You'll have everything you - So I ask, what are you waiting for? - Let's make something great together.
