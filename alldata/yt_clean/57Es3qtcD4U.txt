&gt;&gt; Narrator: WHEN IT COMES TO MONEY, THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAVE, THOSE WHO ARE STINGY, AND THEN THERE ARE CHEAPSKATES. &gt;&gt; DON'T MIND IF I TAKE IT, DO YOU? &gt;&gt; Narrator: THEY EAT FOOD DESTINED FOR THE TRASH. &gt;&gt; I FIND THAT UTTERLY GROTESQUE. &gt;&gt; Narrator: THEY REUSE THEIR TOILET PAPER. &gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN USING THEM FOR MORE THAN FIVE YEARS. &gt;&gt; THIS IS DIRTY. &gt;&gt; Narrator: AND THEY DIG DEEP TO SAVE A BUCK. &gt;&gt; WE GET ACCESS TO THE BRAIN THROUGH HERE. &gt;&gt; Narrator: WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF EXTREME CHEAPSKATES. -- Captions by VITAC -- CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY &gt;&gt; MY NAME IS ROY G. HAYNES. I LIVE IN VERMONT WITH MY WIFE, LISA. OHH. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN REALLY DESCRIBE ROY'S CHEAP WAYS. &gt;&gt; I'M SQUEEZING THE LAST FEW DROPS OUT OF THIS HOSE. &gt;&gt; HE TAKES IT TO THE EXTREME. &gt;&gt; BY ANY CHANCE, DO YOU HAVE ANY MUSTARD PACKETS? I NEVER FILL IT, AND I NEVER SPILL IT. NOT THAT I'M AMERICA'S CHEAPEST MAN -- THAT I'M THE WORLD'S CHEAPEST MAN. &gt;&gt; HI. &gt;&gt; HI, THERE. &gt;&gt; HI. &gt;&gt; GOING OUT TO DINNER WITH ROY CAN BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING FOR ME 'CAUSE ROY HAS SOME PECULIAR HABITS AT THE DINNER TABLE. WHAT'S THE MATTER, ROY? WHERE YOU GOING, ROY? &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE FINISHED WITH THAT, YOU DON'T MIND IF I TAKE IT, DO YOU? &gt;&gt; UM... YOU SURE YOU REALLY WANT IT? &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. YOU LOOK LIKE NICE FOLKS. AND IT'S GOOD FOOD, SO... &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. I -- &gt;&gt; WASTE NOT, WANT NOT. &gt;&gt; OH, OKAY. OKAY. GO AHEAD. &gt;&gt; GREAT. THANK YOU. IT'S BETTER THAN IT GOING IN THE DUMPSTER, ISN'T IT? &gt;&gt; I GUESS THAT'S TRUE. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT'LL BE PUT TO GOOD USE. &gt;&gt; WEIRD. &gt;&gt; HE TAKES FOOD FROM OTHER PEOPLE'S TABLES. I FIND THAT UTTERLY GROTESQUE, AND IT'S VERY EMBARRASSING. &gt;&gt; I WAS GROSSED OUT. I FEEL REALLY BAD FOR HIS WIFE 'CAUSE SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY EMBARRASSED. IT'S DISGUSTING. &gt;&gt; I HAVE NO QUALMS ABOUT ASKING STRANGERS FOR THEIR LEFTOVER FOOD. PEOPLE OFTENTIMES GIVE ME FUNNY LOOKS OR EVEN DIRTY LOOKS, BUT I'M UNAFFECTED BY THAT. [ DOG BARKS ] &gt;&gt; THE FRUGAL WAYS THAT ROY HAS HAVE ALLOWED US TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS OUR TIME AND EFFORT ON SAVING ANIMALS. WE GOT A LETTER, TOO, FROM A GENTLEMAN WHOSE WIFE HAD PASSED AWAY, AND HE'S GOT A 15-YEAR-OLD DOG THAT NEEDS A PLACE TO GO. &gt;&gt; OUR RESCUE ORGANIZATION IS SAVE OUR STRAYS, AND WE HAVE PLACED WELL OVER 3,000 CATS AND DOGS. IT'S VERY REWARDING. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVEN'T BITTEN ANYBODY ALL DAY. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; WE MAKE MONEY BY PET-SITTING. &gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT RESCUING DOGS IS COSTLY, SO ROY HAS A LOT OF CHEAPSKATE TRICKS TO STRETCH THEIR INCOME. &gt;&gt; IT'S A SATISFYING FEELING, KNOWING THAT YOU'RE NOT PAYING FULL PRICE FOR ANYTHING. HI. HOW YOU DOING? GOOD. CAN I GET A FEW OF THOSE EXTRA PACKETS OF KETCHUP? &gt;&gt; SURE. HOW MANY YOU WANT? &gt;&gt; AS MANY AS YOU CAN SPARE. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE. WHAT ARE THEY FOR? HOW ABOUT THAT? &gt;&gt; APPRECIATE IT. [ BOTH LAUGH ] &gt;&gt; THANKS A LOT. &gt;&gt; HAVE A GOOD ONE. &gt;&gt; I REFILL THE BOTTLES THAT I HAVE AT HOME. IT'S VERY SIMPLE PROCEDURE, NOT EVEN TIME-CONSUMING. LEARNED AT A YOUNG AGE TO CUT CORNERS. &gt;&gt; ROY GETS KETCHUP PACKETS FROM DIFFERENT PLACES, AND HE REFILLS HIS KETCHUP BOTTLE. A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THAT'S WEIRD, BUT, YOU KNOW, AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, IT'S JUST NORMAL TO ME. &gt;&gt; I SAVE PROBABLY $70 OR $80 A YEAR JUST ON KETCHUP ALONE. MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER PAPER TOWELS DISPOSABLE. I REUSE THEM. SPRUCE IT UP, BRING IT A LITTLE BACK TO LIFE. VOILa. I COULD REUSE THESE PAPER TOWELS THREE TO FIVE TIMES. &gt;&gt; Narrator: ROY ESTIMATES THAT OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS, HE'S SAVED NEARLY $2,000 JUST BY REUSING PAPER TOWELS. BUT HE ALSO KNOWS HOW TO SQUEEZE SAVINGS OUT OF HIS TOILETRIES. &gt;&gt; IF THE BLADES, WHICH ARE KIND OF FLIMSY ON THESE DISPOSABLES -- IF THEY GET DULL, I SHARPEN THEM ON THE STRIKING PART OF A BOOK OF MATCHES. GIVE THEM A WHOLE NEW LIFE. WHEN YOU CAN'T SQUEEZE ANYMORE OUT AND IT APPEARS TO BE EMPTY, THAT'S THE END, AND THEY JUST TOSS IT AWAY. WRONG. CUT YOUR TUBE. AND THERE'S A WEEK'S WORTH STILL LEFT IN THERE. I BUY CHEAP 2-PLY TOILET PAPER, AND I GET TWO ROLLS OUT OF ONE. I GET TWICE AS MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE DOES FOR THE SAME PRICE. &gt;&gt; BY ROY'S CALCULATION, THIS STRATEGY NETS HIM AN EXTRA $6 A MONTH. &gt;&gt; I DO NOT ENJOY 2-PLY TOILET PAPER BEING SEPARATED. I JUST KIND OF REFOLD IT SO THAT IT'S A LITTLE THICKER. &gt;&gt; TOILET PAPER IS A LOT LIKE LIFE IN GENERAL -- THE CLOSER YOU GET TO THE END, THE FASTER IT SEEMS TO GO. &gt;&gt; Narrator: AMERICANS SPEND OVER $300 BILLION A YEAR ON CLOTHES, BUT ROY'S SHARE SINCE 2009 HAS BEEN A GRAND TOTAL OF 9 BUCKS. &gt;&gt; I HAD A NICE SHIRT THAT WAS MY FAVORITE SHIRT. IT FIT ME WELL, AND I REALLY LIKED IT. I HAD BOUGHT IT NEW. IT WAS OFF A CLEARANCE RACK AT A STORE. I PAID $8 FOR IT. AND AFTER WEARING IT FOR ABOUT A YEAR OR SO, IT GOT AN INK STAIN FROM A PEN IN THE POCKET. SO, I WENT TO THE DRY CLEANER. THEY TOLD ME IT WOULD BE ABOUT $12, SO NATURALLY THAT DIDN'T SIT RIGHT WITH ME. I DONATED IT TO THE THRIFT STORE. I WENT BACK TWO DAYS LATER, THEY HAD TAKEN THE STAIN OUT COMPLETELY, AND I PURCHASED IT FOR $1. [ DOG BARKING ] TODAY DOES HAPPEN TO BE MY ANNIVERSARY. LISA AND I ARE MARRIED FOR 25 YEARS NOW. I PROPOSED WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT I NEEDED SOME DENTAL SURGERY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN RATHER EXPENSIVE. &gt;&gt; I HAD A JOB. YOU DIDN'T HAVE A JOB. I HAD INSURANCE. YOU NEEDED PERIODONTAL SURGERY. &gt;&gt; GOT MARRIED ON A TUESDAY. &gt;&gt; GOT YOUR SURGERY ON A WEDNESDAY. &gt;&gt; GOT MY SURGERY ON A WEDNESDAY. WHAT A COUNTRY. MY GOALS ARE TO FIND SOMETHING NICE TO GIVE MY WIFE LISA FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY... &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; ...BE IT FROM A DUMPSTER, A DISCOUNT STORE, OR EVEN ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'M COMING BACK. &gt;&gt; THE GIFTS -- THERE'S NO LIKE DIAMONDS, THERE'S NO NECKLACES, THERE'S NO EXTRAVAGANT TRIPS. &gt;&gt; THE ICING ON THE CAKE SHOULD BE THE DINNER OUT TONIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'LL BE BRINGING HOME, BUT IT WILL BE SOMETHING. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'LL COME UP WITH IN THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY. HOPEFULLY I WON'T HAVE TO SPEND AS MUCH AS $10, WHICH I TRY NOT TO. [ HORN BLARING ] AS A PROFESSIONAL, WHAT I TAKE WITH ME IS A CRATE AND A PAIR OF WORK GLOVES. AND THOSE ARE MY TOOLS OF THE TRADE, SO TO SPEAK. &gt;&gt; SOME HUSBANDS HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF HOBBIES. MY HUSBAND HAS A HOBBY OF DUMPSTER-DIVING. I MEAN, IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE FOR HIM TO TAKE UP GOLF. &gt;&gt; ANNIVERSARY GIFT FOR LISA. CLEAN THEM UP A LITTLE BIT. ROSES -- NOW, THAT SAYS ROMANCE. I FOUND IT, A LOVELY GIFT FOR LISA. SHE DRINKS TEA. IF IT'S FREE, IT'S FOR ME. &gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT WHILE ROY PREFERS PRICE TAGS THAT READ ZERO, IT IS HIS 25th WEDDING ANNIVERSARY. SO HE STOPS INTO THE LIQUIDATION CENTER TO SEE IF HE CAN SCARE UP ANOTHER CHEAP PRESENT OR TWO. &gt;&gt; LISA IS USUALLY NOT ANTICIPATING ANYTHING TOO LUXURIOUS IN THE WAY OF GIFTS. 29 CENTS. LISA LOVES ANIMALS AND SHE DOES LIKE ANIMAL CRACKERS AND THEY HAPPEN TO HAVE SOME HERE. THEY'RE NOT EVEN EXPIRED. SHE'LL LOVE IT. SHE LIKES BOTTLED WATER, AND HERE IT IS, AT THE RIGHT PRICE. IT'S A LITTLE MORE THAN I WANTED TO SPEND. IT'S 99 CENTS, BUT I'M GONNA GO ALL OUT THIS YEAR. I THINK SHE'S GONNA LOVE IT. THE WEIRDEST GIFT I EVER GOT LISA... THAT TAKES A LITTLE THOUGHT. I'VE BROUGHT HER SOME DOOZIES. THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE WELCOME. YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY. &gt;&gt; Narrator: HAVING SPENT LESS THAN $2 ON HIS WIFE FOR THEIR 25th WEDDING ANNIVERSARY, ROY FINISHES HIS SHOPPING DAY BY PUTTING TOGETHER A CARD. &gt;&gt; I'M WRITING A NICE ANNIVERSARY CARD FOR LISA. IT'S ONE THAT'S BEEN GIVEN TO HER IN THE PAST. I'M JUST REARRANGING IT. &quot;HI, LISA. WISHING YOU A HAPPY ANNIVERSARY. HOPE TO SEE YOU SOON. ROY.&quot; &gt;&gt; Narrator: COMING UP, LISA CELEBRATES 25 YEARS OF BEING MARRIED TO THE SELF-PROCLAIMED CHEAPEST MAN IN THE WORLD... &gt;&gt; CLOSE YOUR EYES. &gt;&gt; Narrator: ...AND WE MEET A MOTHER OF SIX SO CHEAP SHE REFUSES TO BUY TOILET PAPER. &gt;&gt; THIS IS KIND OF DIRTY. &gt;&gt; IT'S OKAY. IT'S CLEAN. &gt;&gt; Narrator: ROY HAYNES IS AN EXTREME CHEAPSKATE WHO RUNS AN ANIMAL-RESCUE CENTER WITH HIS WIFE, LISA, IN HUNTINGTON, VERMONT. BUT TODAY IS A SPECIAL ONE FOR THIS DOG-LOVING COUPLE. IT'S THEIR 25th WEDDING ANNIVERSARY, AND IN TRUE PENNY-PINCHER FORM, ROY'S COME UP WITH AN IDEA TO CELEBRATE THAT WON'T COST HIM A THING. HE'S TAKING LISA ON A STROLL DOWN MEMORY LANE TO THE TOWN HALL WHERE THEY GOT MARRIED. [ BELL CHIMES ] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE ME A LITTLE SNUGGLY. &gt;&gt; WELL, IT REMINDS ME OF OUR WEDDING DAY WHEN WE GOT MARRIED AT CITY HALL. REMEMBER THAT FIASCO? MEMORIES ARE FREE. THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS GOOD, BUT THEY'RE FREE. &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T A FIASCO, BUT IT WAS SORT OF A FATEFUL DAY. [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; YEAH, AT LEAST YOU HAD A GOOD MEAL WHEN WE GOT OUT OF THERE. &gt;&gt; ON THE DAY THAT WE DID GET MARRIED, THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE THERE, AND THEY DID THROW RICE. ROY BENT DOWN AND HE SCOOPED UP THE RICE AND HE PICKED IT UP AND THEN HE TOOK IT HOME AND HE COOKED IT FOR DINNER. AND I DID NOT EAT IT, AND I STARTED TO HAVE A SECOND THOUGHT ABOUT WHO I MARRIED. OH, NO, HE FOUND RICE. OH, CRAP. [ LAUGHS ] COME ON, ROY. PICK IT UP QUICKER, WILL YOU? IT'S COLD OUTSIDE. &gt;&gt; NAG, NAG, NAG. SOME NICE BROWN RICE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE BROWN, ROY. THAT'S WHITE RICE. &gt;&gt; [ CHUCKLES ] &gt;&gt; COME, MY RICE-Y FRIEND. &gt;&gt; [ GROANS ] &gt;&gt; THERE ARE SOME BENEFITS TO BEING MARRIED TO A CHEAP MAN. I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HIM RUNNING OUT AND SPENDING MONEY ON WINE, WOMEN, AND SONG. SO I'M SAFE THERE. YOU'RE NOT GONNA SHAKE IT LOOSE. &gt;&gt; I'M GONNA TRY. AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA FEED IT TO ME. &gt;&gt; Narrator: FOLLOWING THE RICE INCIDENT, LISA ISN'T FEELING VERY ROMANTIC. INSTEAD, SHE'S WORRIED ROY'S CHEAPSKATE WAYS WILL EMBARRASS HER WHEN THEY GO TO DINNER LATER THAT NIGHT. &gt;&gt; I'D LIKE YOU NOT TO TAKE FOOD FROM OTHER PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL. YOU KNOW, I DO IT ALL THE TIME. &gt;&gt; I KNOW YOU DO IT ALL THE TIME. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T EAT IT. I DO. &gt;&gt; JUST THIS ONCE. I MEAN, ONE IN 25 YEARS WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT TO EAT AND NOT TAKE SOMEBODY ELSE'S FOOD HOME. IT WOULD BE LIKE AN ANNIVERSARY PRESENT THAT DOESN'T COST YOU ANYTHING. &gt;&gt; Narrator: WITH THE DOGS FED, ROY AND LISA HEAD OUT TO CELEBRATE THEIR BIG NIGHT. BUT WILL ROY BE ABLE TO BEHAVE HIMSELF AT DINNER? &gt;&gt; THIS PLACE THAT I'M TAKING LISA IS NOT PARTICULARLY CHEAP, BUT OCCASIONALLY I MAKE EXCEPTIONS FOR MY WIFE. &gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING, SIR. &gt;&gt; HOW ARE YOU? &gt;&gt; AND HOPEFULLY I WON'T EMBARRASS HER TOO MUCH TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; SO, NOW WHAT? &gt;&gt; LET ME GET YOUR GIFTS, MY DEAR. &gt;&gt; WELL, MAYBE NOT. [ LAUGHS ] MAYBE IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA. &gt;&gt; HO, HO, MERRY CHRISTMAS. CLOSE YOUR EYES. &gt;&gt; I CAN'T. I'M PRAYING. &gt;&gt; SMELL. &gt;&gt; NO, I'M NOT GONNA SMELL. &gt;&gt; HAPPY ANNIVERSARY. &gt;&gt; I DON'T SMELL ANYTHING. OH. SORT OF NICE. &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU LIKE THEM? &gt;&gt; LOVELY. EVERYONE LIKES FLOWERS, BUT NOT EVERYONE LIKES DEAD FLOWERS. OH, I'VE ALWAYS -- &gt;&gt; HAPPY ANNIVERSARY HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY ANNIVERSARY &gt;&gt; IS IT USED? &gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; DID YOU BUY IT OR FIND IT? &gt;&gt; IT'S FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; VERY NICE. THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE WELCOME. &gt;&gt; ANNIVERSARY. &gt;&gt; ANNIVERSARY. &gt;&gt; AH! &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THAT. &gt;&gt; I KNEW THERE HAD TO BE A REASON WHY YOU WERE OUT HERE. &gt;&gt; BEAUTIFUL. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO COUPON TODAY. &gt;&gt; NO. [ LAUGHTER ] &gt;&gt; I GOT YOU A NICE CARD. &gt;&gt; IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE GOT ME THAT CARD. THIS IS FROM WHEN I WASN'T FEELING GOOD, THAT JANE SENT ME. AND YOU'VE CHANGED MY DATE AND ADDED WORDS AND YOUR NAME. &gt;&gt; ISN'T THAT NICE? &gt;&gt; EXCEPT FOR THE &quot;HOPE TO SEE YOU SOON&quot; PART. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU CARE TO SEND THE VERY BEST. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T GET IT FROM ROY. [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE, I NOTICE SOME APPETIZING FOOD AT THE VERY NEXT TABLE. &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY'S LEAVING. &gt;&gt; HOW'S EVERYTHING TONIGHT, FELLAS? &gt;&gt; GOOD. &gt;&gt; GOOD. &gt;&gt; GONNA BE SOME LEFTOVERS THIS EVENING? &gt;&gt; HAVE AT IT. &gt;&gt; I SURE AM HUNGRY. &gt;&gt; [ CHUCKLES ] IT'S A LITTLE ODD THAT HE COMES OVER AND ASKS FOR MY LEFTOVERS, YEAH, BUT TO EACH HIS OWN, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; IT'S A GOOD COMBINATION. &gt;&gt; WHEN ROY REACHES OVER AND TRIES TO GRAB SOMEONE ELSE'S FOOD, IT'S ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING, AND THERE'S NO NEED FOR IT. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, FOLKS. &gt;&gt; I WENT OUT OF THERE AS FAST AS I CAN 'CAUSE HE IS ABSOLUTELY MORTIFYING. ALTHOUGH HE'S A LITTLE BIT ANNOYING AND IRKS YOU ALL OF THE TIME, YOU CAN GET OVER THAT STUFF 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, ROY'S ROY. I WAS NOT SURE IF I SHOULD COME BACK IN OR NOT EVER. OKAY, ROY. YOU'RE GROSS. [ Laughing ] YEAH, KEEP ON GOING. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY GROSS. OKAY. GOT MORE GIFTS? [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; WALK WITH THE ANIMALS &gt;&gt; [ Laughing ] YOU KNOW THAT WHENEVER I HAVE ANYTHING WITH ANIMALS... NOW I'M GETTING GREEDY. I'M LIKE, &quot;OKAY, MORE GIFTS, PLEASE.&quot; &gt;&gt; HOLD OUT YOUR HAND. KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED. &gt;&gt; IF YOU PUT A CHICKEN WING IN THERE, I'M GONNA KILL YOU. &gt;&gt; NOPE. YOU MAY OPEN. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] THIS ISN'T EXACTLY ANNIVERSARY, BUT -- I DO LOVE IT. [ LAUGHS ] KIND OF REMINDS ME OF YOU. [ LAUGHS ] BUT THIS LOOKS LIKE YOU ACTUALLY PAID FOR IT. &gt;&gt; I DID. &gt;&gt; THIS IS TURNING OUT TO BE A GOOD NIGHT, AFTER ALL... &gt;&gt; SEE THAT? &gt;&gt; ...DESPITE EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; AND YOU HAD YOUR DOUBTS. CHEERS. &gt;&gt; CHEERS. &gt;&gt; HAPPY ANNIVERSARY. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; SHE'S A VERY COMPASSIONATE PERSON. NOT ONLY DOES SHE PUT UP WITH ALL THE DOGS. SHE PUTS UP WITH ME. SO GOD BLESS HER. &gt;&gt; YOU READY? &gt;&gt; NOW IT'S TIME TO SHOW YOU WHAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE FOR DINNER... &gt;&gt; Narrator: COMING UP, WHAT WILL THE NEIGHBORS THINK WHEN THEY CATCH WIND OF ANGELA'S REUSABLE TOILET PAPER? &gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO TO SAVE MONEY IS WE USE CLOTH TOILET PAPER. &gt;&gt; I'M ANGELA COFFMAN, AND I LIVE IN KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI. HERE'S WHAT WE'VE GOT ON OUR LINE-UP, GUYS -- THE LAUNDRY, HELPING WITH THE COOKIE CAKE, AND ALSO WITH WASHING THE WINDOWS. I HAVE SIX CHILDREN, AND I'M MARRIED TO DARREN COFFMAN. &gt;&gt; MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE SIX KIDS, BUT WE'RE KIND OF AN AVERAGE MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILY. ANGELA, YOU READY TO TALK ABOUT THE BUDGET? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHEN WE WERE NEWLY MARRIED, WE USED OUR CREDIT CARD ON EVERYTHING. WHEN WE FINALLY ADDED IT UP, IT WAS $89,000 THAT WE OWED. &gt;&gt; HEIDI'S STARTING HER POINT CLASS. &gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT BY PINCHING SOME SERIOUS PENNIES AND CUTTING UP ALL THEIR CARDS, THE COFFMANS WERE ABLE TO ELIMINATE THEIR ENTIRE CREDIT-CARD DEBT IN UNDER A YEAR. &gt;&gt; AFTER THAT EXPERIENCE WHERE WE GOT OUT OF DEBT, WE FIGURED OUT THAT IT WASN'T THAT HARD TO LIVE THAT WAY. ALL RIGHT, THAT SOUNDS GOOD. I WANT MY CHILDREN ALSO TO SEE THE FRUGAL EXAMPLE. WHEN THE CEREAL GETS TO THE BOTTOM, NOBODY WANTS THAT. AND WE SAVE THEM UP. THEN I ADD IT TO BREAD OR ANY WAY I CAN SNEAK IT IN. IT TAKES THE PLACE OF SOME OF THE FLOUR. &gt;&gt; [ GIGGLES ] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE GIVE THE KIDS A BATH, WE MAKE THEM ALL SHARE THE SAME BATH WATER. AND THEN THE OLDER TWO CHILDREN WILL TAKE SHOWERS IN THE MORNING, AND WE TIME THEM. WE SAVE MONEY ON OUR GROCERY BUDGET BY MAKING OUR OWN CLEANING SUPPLIES. AND NOW IT'S FREE. &gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT THE COFFMANS HAVEN'T STOPPED THERE. THEY'VE ELIMINATED ONE ITEM FROM THEIR BUDGET THAT NEARLY EVERYONE CONSIDERS A NECESSITY -- THEIR TOILET PAPER. &gt;&gt; I'M CUTTING TOILET-PAPER SQUARES FOR OUR BATHROOM THAT WE WILL WASH AND USE INSTEAD OF PAPER PRODUCTS. WE HAVE A LITTLE BIN UNDERNEATH THE BASKET THAT HOLDS THE LITTLE TOILET WIPES, WHERE WE PUT THEM SO WE CAN WASH THEM LATER. AND THEN, WHEN IT'S TIME TO WASH, I JUST POUR THEM IN, AND I NEVER HAVE TO TOUCH THEM WITH MY HANDS. BUYING TOILET PAPER JUST DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR ME. AS A MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILY THAT MAKES A GOOD INCOME, I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GO INTO DEBT TO BUY TOILET PAPER. ALL OF OUR CLOTH WIPES THAT WE HAVE IN THE HOUSE -- WE'VE BEEN USING THEM FOR MORE THAN FIVE YEARS. USING CLOTH TOILET PAPER SAVES US $20 A MONTH. OVER A YEAR, THEN THAT IS $240. I HAD ONE PERSON SAY SHE COULDN'T CONTAMINATE HER WASHING MACHINE. AND I JUST HAD TO LAUGH BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BACTERIA, THERE'S NO WAY IT CAN SURVIVE THOSE HARSH CONDITIONS. SO CONTAMINATION'S NOT AN ISSUE AT ALL. &gt;&gt; WHEN ANGELA FIRST CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF CLOTH TOILET PAPER, I WAS KIND OF A LITTLE SKEPTICAL. ONCE I GOT USED TO IT, TO ME, IT'S MORE COMFORTING TO HAVE SOMETHING SOLID ON YOUR HAND THAN THE PAPER STUFF. &gt;&gt; THIS IS KIND OF DIRTY. &gt;&gt; IT'S OKAY. IT'S CLEAN. &gt;&gt; Narrator: AFTER FOLDING A FRESH LOAD OF REUSABLE TOILET PAPER, ANGELA AND THE GANG ARE OFF TO HUNT DOWN THE CHEAPEST DINNER THEY CAN FIND, BUT THIS IS NO ORDINARY SHOPPING TRIP. TO SAVE MONEY, THE COFFMANS RECENTLY JOINED A BABY-SITTING CLUB, AND TONIGHT IT'S THEIR TURN TO TAKE ON THREE OF THEIR NEIGHBORS' KIDS. &gt;&gt; THE FAMILY THAT'S BABYSITTING PROVIDES THE MEAL, THEN, FOR ALL THE CHILDREN. FOR TONIGHT, WE'RE MAKING PIZZA, AND THEN WE'RE ALSO GOING FORAGING TO GET SOME WILD THINGS TO MAKE A BEAUTIFUL SALAD. &gt;&gt; Narrator: CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST OF FEEDING 11 HUNGRY MOUTHS, ANGELA HEADS TO THE SALVAGE STORE, WHERE SHE CAN FIND GROCERIES FOR HALF-PRICE OR LESS. BUT THERE'S A CATCH -- MOST OF THE PRODUCTS ARE EXPIRED. &gt;&gt; THAT'S $6 FOR 5 POUNDS OF CHEESE. &gt;&gt; HOW IS IT? YOU WANT IT? &gt;&gt; PACKAGED ON JUNE 11th. WELL, I DON'T SEE ANY MOLD. WHY DON'T YOU GRAB ONE MORE? THAT'S LIKE A LITTLE MORE THAN $1 A POUND. OH, HOLD ON, GUYS. IT'S ONLY 50 CENTS FOR PASTA SAUCE. IT EXPIRED IN NOVEMBER OF 2009. BUT IT'S SEALED PRETTY GOOD. IT'S PROBABLY OKAY. THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON. &gt;&gt; YOU, TOO. &gt;&gt; THEN ANGELA TAKES THE KIDS TO A LOCAL PARK TO FORAGE FOR SALAD FIXINGS. &gt;&gt; RIGHT HERE, THIS IS WILD CHIVES. YOU CAN JUST SNIP THEM OFF LIKE THIS. FORAGING IS FREE. MY GRANDMOTHER GREW UP IN THE DEPRESSION AND WE WOULD GO ON NATURE WALKS AND SHE WOULD SHOW ME ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE EDIBLE. HERE'S ACTUAL CLOVER, WHICH -- THE LEAVES ARE EDIBLE, TOO. WHOA, DOG POOP. WATCH OUT FOR DOG POOP. AH! [ LAUGHS ] WIPE YOUR FOOT OFF IN THE GRASS. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M SPENDING $10 FOR ALL OF THE FOOD TONIGHT, WHICH INCLUDES FOUR LARGE PIZZAS AND THEN THREE COOKIE CAKES, AND THEN A TOSSED SALAD MADE FROM WILD THINGS. [ DOORBELL RINGS ] &gt;&gt; HEY. &gt;&gt; HI. HOW ARE YOU? I THINK THAT ANGELA HAS FRUGAL WAYS, HER AND DARREN, BUT I ALSO THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, TO EACH THEIR OWN. &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT PIZZAS. THEN WE MADE A WILD SALAD, WHERE WE KIND OF WENT TO THE FIELD A COUPLE BLOCKS OVER. SO, THAT'S WHAT THAT IS. &gt;&gt; THAT KIND OF CAUGHT ME A LITTLE OFF GUARD. I MEAN, I'M ALL FOR THE GARDEN WITHOUT THE PESTICIDES. I MEAN, SHE'S KIND OF SOUNDING LIKE SHE'S JUST PICKING FLOWERS OUT OF THE GROUND, BUT PEOPLE DID THAT, SO IT MIGHT BE GOOD. &gt;&gt; AND BEFORE YOU GO, I JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU REAL QUICK ABOUT THE BATHROOM. ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO TO SAVE MONEY IS WE USE CLOTH TOILET PAPERS. YOU JUST USE THEM LIKE YOU WOULD REGULAR TOILET PAPER, BUT THEN YOU JUST DROP THEM IN THE BUCKET. &gt;&gt; YOU COULD GO AND BUY SOME TOILET PAPER FOR $3 A PACKAGE, BUT IF THAT'S WHAT THEY LIKE TO DO, THEN I SAY ALL THE MORE POWER TO THEM. &gt;&gt; Narrator: FOR 10 BUCKS WORTH OF EXPIRED CHEESE AND SAUCE, ANGELA HAS FED 11 PEOPLE AND COVERED A MONTH'S WORTH OF BABYSITTING COSTS, SAVING THE FAMILY NEARLY $400. &gt;&gt; ANYBODY WANT SOME WILD SALAD? &gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; NO, THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; Narrator: AND IF ANYONE NEEDS TO USE THE RESTROOM AFTER DINNER, THE PRICE OF ADMISSION IS ABSOLUTELY FREE. [ TOILET FLUSHES ] COMING UP, WE MEET A PENNY PINCHER WITH A TASTE FOR THE EXOTIC. &gt;&gt; WE GET ACCESS TO THE BRAIN THROUGH HERE. &gt;&gt; 10 CENTS. MY NAME IS JEFF YEAGER. I'M KNOWN AT THE ULTIMATE CHEAPSKATE. 12 CENTS. AH! AHA, WHAT DID I TELL YOU? ANOTHER NICKEL. IT'S A GOLD MINE. I LIVE IN ACCOKEEK, MARYLAND. I'M MARRIED TO DENISE, AND WE'VE BEEN MARRIED 28 YEARS. &gt;&gt; LOVE YOU, HONEY. &gt;&gt; LOVE YOU. &gt;&gt; IF YOU PINCH THE PENNIES, THE DOLLARS WILL PINCH THEMSELVES. SO, SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS PICKING UP A PENNY -- THOSE LITTLE ACTS OF FRUGALITY THEMSELVES AREN'T GOING TO MAKE YOU RICH, BUT THEY ESTABLISH A VERY DIFFERENT MIND-SET. &gt;&gt; Narrator: THAT ATTITUDE TOWARD LIFE MADE JEFF AND HIS WIFE, DENISE, COME TO AN AGREEMENT EARLY ON IN THEIR MARRIAGE. &gt;&gt; I SAID, &quot;LISTEN, HONEY, WHY DON'T WE SORT OF MAKE AN INFORMAL PACT TO ESTABLISH A PERMANENT STANDARD OF LIVING, TO ALWAYS CONTINUE TO LIVE AT THIS LEVEL?&quot; &gt;&gt; IF YOU'VE LOOKED AROUND OUR HOUSE, YOU NOTICE WE HAVE NO FLAT-SCREEN TVs, WE HAVE NO CELLPHONES, NO iPODS, NO iPADS, NO &quot;iWHATEVERS.&quot; &gt;&gt; MOST PEOPLE HAVE CONTINUED TO ALLOW THEIR LIFESTYLE AND THEIR SPENDING TO ESCALATE AS THEY EARNED MORE AND MORE. WE'RE BASICALLY ABLE TO RETIRE OR DO WHAT WE WANT FOR A LIVING, AND MANY OF OUR PEERS ARE NOWHERE NEAR READY TO RETIRE OR HAVE THE KIND OF FINANCIAL FREEDOM WE DO. &gt;&gt; Narrator: TO IMPROVE THEIR FINANCIAL STANDING, FIVE TIMES A YEAR, JEFF AND DENISE TAKE THEIR CHEAPEST TO ITS FULLEST WITH WHAT THEY CALL A FISCAL FAST. &gt;&gt; WE TAKE A WEEK WHERE WE SPEND NO MONEY. I DESCRIBE IT AS SPENDING DETOX. &gt;&gt; Narrator: JEFF AND DENISE ESTIMATE EACH WEEK-LONG FISCAL FAST HAS SAVED THEM $700. OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR 28-YEAR MARRIAGE, THAT'S OVER $100,000. &gt;&gt; IT'S REALLY GONNA SHOW YOU HOW YOU SPEND AND WASTE MONEY. WE TRY TO USE IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE STUFF UP. SO, YOU'RE GONNA USE UP THE FOOD THAT YOU HAVE ON HAND. AND, YOU KNOW, ALSO, THE WEEK OF THE FISCAL FAST IS THE WEEK WHERE WE FINALLY USE UP THOSE LITTLE BOTTLES OF SHAMPOO WE'VE BEEN SAVING FROM THE MOTEL FOR ALL THOSE YEARS. &gt;&gt; Narrator: FOR THE YEAGERS, THE TRASH CAN IS ACTUALLY A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION BECAUSE DURING THE FAST THEY THROW VIRTUALLY NOTHING AWAY. &gt;&gt; WE'RE ON THE FINAL DAY OF THE FISCAL FAST HERE, SO THINGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE LEAN. WE ALL HAVE THESE LITTLE SLIVERS OF SOAP, AND A LOT OF TIMES WE JUST THROW THIS STUFF AWAY. BUT WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS SORT OF A DAILY DOUBLE OF CREATIVE REPURPOSE PAUSING, AS I CALL IT, IT TAKE AN OLD PAIR OF DENISE'S PANTYHOSE AND SAVE THESE LITTLE SOAP SLIVERS DOWN HERE. A LITTLE SEXY, THE CHEAPSKATE SOAP ON A ROPE. &gt;&gt; I WALKED IN OUR BATHROOM ONE DAY, AND THERE'S JEFF USING MY PANTYHOSE FOR THE SOAP ON A ROPE. [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST LITTLE WAYS, AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT A FISCAL FAST CAN TEACH YOU, IS THERE'S ALL KINDS OF THINGS YOU CAN THROW AWAY ALL THE TIME THAT YOU CAN REUSE. &gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT AFTER A WEEK OF NO SPENDING WHATSOEVER, JEFF'S GOING TO HAVE TO GET RESOURCEFUL IF THEY WANT TO EAT. &gt;&gt; DON'T GET YOUR HOPES BUILT UP, AND I'M HOPING TO DO SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR DINNER. EVEN THOUGH THIS IS LAST DAY OF THE FISCAL FAST, I'M GONNA HAVE TO GET CREATIVE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN DO THAT. &gt;&gt; Narrator: AT THIS STAGE, JEFF WILL NOT BUY DINNER UNLESS HE CAN FIND ENOUGH CHANGE TO PAY FOR IT. &gt;&gt; WHEN WE WERE KIDS, OUR FAVORITE THING TO DO WOULD BE LOOK FOR LOST CHANGE IN THE CUSHIONS OF SOFAS AND CHAIRS. &gt;&gt; THIS IS SOMETHING I WILL ROLL MY EYES AT, I WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN. &gt;&gt; YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW MUCH LOOSE CHANGE YOU CAN FIND. &gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT WITH THE COUCH ALREADY PICKED CLEAN, JEFF WILL NEED TO GET HIS HANDS DIRTY TO DIG UP THE CHANGE HE NEEDS. &gt;&gt; I'D LIKE TO CLEAN OUT MY VACUUM-CLEANER BAGS, BOTH TO REUSE THEM, AS WELL AS OCCASIONALLY FIND LOOSE CHANGE IN THERE. YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS THINK OF THIS MORE KIND OF PANNING FOR GOLD. YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL AS IT COMES OUT 'CAUSE IF THERE'S COINS, IT CAN EASILY BE LOST. A PENNY. SOMETHING. A NICKEL. 6 CENTS. OH! I'M SURPRISED. 11 CENTS. I GUESS THAT'S ABOUT IT. SO, I ONLY MADE 11 CENTS. BUT I SAVED THIS VACUUM-CLEANER BAG, AND THERE'S ANOTHER NICKEL. SO I'M 16 CENTS BETTER OFF. I'VE SAVED A COUPLE DOLLARS ON THE BAG. WHAT COULD BE BETTER? &gt;&gt; Narrator: WITH ONLY 16 CENTS FROM THE VACUUM, JEFF NEEDS TO FIND MORE FUNDS FOR DINNER. SO HE HEADS INTO TOWN TO PROSPECT FOR LOOSE CHANGE. &gt;&gt; I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN BICYCLING. PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE HOW MUCH OWNING A CAR COSTS. THE ACTUAL COST TO OWN AND OPERATE A CAR IS ABOUT 50 CENTS TO $1 PER MILE. I'VE RIDDEN IT 90,000 MILES SINCE THE 1970s. BY MY CALCULATION, THAT'S SAVED ME OVER $250,000. EUREKA! 50 CENTS. IT'S MY LUCKY DAY. TIME FOR THE TAPE MEASURE. IT'S GREAT FOR FISHING AROUND. IT'S A QUARTER. THIS THING IS LIKE A DIRT PILE OF AN ATM. I'M BIG ON LOOKING FOR LOST CHANGE. I'VE SORT OF STUDIED IT ALMOST AS A SCIENCE. LAUNDROMATS ARE A GREAT PLACE TO LOOK FOR CHANGE. SOMEBODY DIDN'T CHECK VERY CAREFULLY. IF YOU FISH DOWN BETWEEN THE MACHINES... I FEEL LIKE A TREASURE HUNTER. EVEN LINT TRAPS CAN YOU FIND CHANGE IN SOMETIMES. CAN I HARVEST FOR MY -- TILL I'M CONTENT? &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; I WOULD IMAGINE, BETWEEN THESE WASHERS, PROBABLY A COUPLE OF DOLLARS. IT'S PROBABLY NOT AS MUCH AS WHAT YOU THINK. YOU WANT SOME MORE? &gt;&gt; I'LL TAKE AS MUCH AS I -- SINCE I'M HERE, I'LL TAKE AS MUCH AS I CAN GET. WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS I LIKE TO USE IT TO START FIRES WITH 'CAUSE IT'S VERY FLAMMABLE. SO I USE IT FOR MY WOOD STOVES. ONE OF THE THINGS I DO I CALL CUSHION MINING. I VERY STEALTHILY LOOK FOR LOST CHANGE IN CUSHIONS OF CHAIRS. WHEN YOU'RE IN A PUBLIC PLACE, SLIDE YOUR HANDS DOWN LIKE THIS. YOU WANT TO BE SUBTLE. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, PEOPLE ARE LOSING CHANGE, AND UNLESS THEY'RE A CHEAPSKATE LIKE ME, THEY'RE TOO PROUD TO GO FISHING AFTER IT. NOTHING. NADA. APPARENTLY, FOLKS AROUND HERE DON'T CARRY MUCH SPARE CHANGE. UNFORTUNATELY THE CUSHION MINING DIDN'T WORK OUT WELL. &gt;&gt; Narrator: COMING UP, JEFF TURNS FOUND CHANGE INTO THE ULTIMATE CHEAPSKATE DINNER. &gt;&gt; THE REAL DELICACY IS THE EYE. MMM. &gt;&gt; Narrator: AFTER RIDING AROUND TOWN ALL DAY SCAVENGING FOR CHANGE, EXTREME CHEAPSKATE JEFF PULLS IN TO A LOCAL CONVENIENCE STORE, HOPING THEY'LL CASH IN HIS DIRTY COINS SO HE CAN PURCHASE DINNER. &gt;&gt; I WAS HAVING SUCH A GREAT DAY, I GAVE UP COUNTING AS I WENT. CAN YOU CHANGE IT IN FOR ME? &gt;&gt; LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I HATE GOING TO A LIKE A COINSTAR KIND OF PLACE 'CAUSE THEY TAKE A CUT. I HAVE THIS THEORY ABOUT &quot;A PENNY SAVED IS A PENNY EARNED.&quot; A PENNY THAT YOU FIND IS ACTUALLY WORTH A LOT MORE THAN A PENNY BECAUSE A PENNY THAT YOU EARN, YOU HAVE TO PAY TAXES ON THAT PENNY, AND YOU HAVE TO SPEND ALL KINDS OF MONEY TO EARN THAT PENNY. IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE AMOUNT, IT'S THE PRINCIPLE OF THE THING. &gt;&gt; ...94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 -- MADE IT TO ANOTHER DOLLAR. &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE A MIRACLE. &gt;&gt; WE GOT $7. &gt;&gt; SO, I'M $7, PLUS... &gt;&gt; A LITTLE EXTRA. &gt;&gt; A LITTLE EXTRA FOR ME. THANK YOU. I'M GONNA GO DO A LITTLE SHOPPING. EVEN THOUGH I'M ON A FISCAL FAST, I'M GONNA DO A LITTLE BIT OF SHOPPING, MAYBE SOME MEAT FOR DINNER. I CREATE MY MENUS AROUND WHAT IS LEAST EXPENSIVE. I LIKE ORGAN MEATS -- LIVERS, KIDNEYS. THAT IS VERY INEXPENSIVE. YOU GOT ANY LIVERS? &gt;&gt; I GOT REGULAR BEEF LIVER. HE COMES IN HERE A LOT. HE'S LOOKING FOR THE KIND OF CRAZY THINGS, KIND OF THINGS THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD NOT BUY OR EAT. &gt;&gt; ANY HEARTS, DEER HEARTS? &gt;&gt; NOT DEER HEARTS. &gt;&gt; NOTHING IS SORT OF OFF LIMITS, PARTICULARLY SOMETHING LIKE COW'S HEART THAT IS VERY INEXPENSIVE. &gt;&gt; TELL YOU, WHAT I DO GOT IS SOME GOATS' HEADS. &gt;&gt; I REALLY DO LOVE THIS STUFF. I MEAN, I'VE EATEN IT ALL AROUND THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; IT'S AN ACQUIRED TASTE. &gt;&gt; BOY, THEY BOTH LOOK GOOD. IS THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN -- I HAVE ABOUT $7.50. CAN YOU DO THAT FOR ME? &gt;&gt; YEAH. YEAH. WE CAN DO THAT. &gt;&gt; YOU SURE? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; I DID REALLY WELL AT THE BUTCHER SHOP AND ENDED UP WITH TWO GOATS' HEADS THAT I'M GONNA BE COOKING FOR DINNER. &gt;&gt; LET'S THROW THESE IN A BAG FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; HAVE HEADS, WILL TRAVEL. &gt;&gt; THERE YOU GO. &gt;&gt; Narrator: AFTER 40 MILES ROUND TRIP TO COLLECT $7.50 WORTH OF CHANGE, JEFF BEGINS PREPARATIONS FOR HIS GOAT-HEAD FEAST. &gt;&gt; I NEVER THROW AWAY MY TINFOIL OR MY ONION-SKIN BAGS. I PUT THE TIN FOIL INSIDE THE ONION SKIN BAGS AND, YOU KNOW, USE THEM AS A POT SCRUBBER. IT'LL LAST A LOT LONGER, YOU KNOW, THAN A STEEL-WOOL PAD. ANY KIND OF CITRUS RIND, AGAIN, IS GREAT FOR SCRUBBING THE BOTTOM OF A COPPER POT. IF YOU ADD A LITTLE BIT OF BAKING SODA TO THAT, IT'LL CLEAN IT RIGHT UP. &gt;&gt; JEFF GETS CREATIVE WITH FOOD. SOME OF THE FOOD HE EATS I JUST CAN'T GET MYSELF TO FATHOM EATING. &gt;&gt; I DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND BOIL THEM A LITTLE BIT. THEY'RE LOOKING PRETTY GOOD. GOOD PAIR OF TEETH ON THAT ONE. &gt;&gt; THERE MIGHT BE SOMETIMES WHEN I WILL BE A LITTLE BIT AFRAID. &gt;&gt; SHE'S NOT A FAN OF ALL OF THE TYPES OF DISHES THAT I COOK. CERTAINLY, SHE'S NOT A FAN OF MANY OF THE MEATS. SO, I'M GONNA THROW A LITTLE BIT OF SEASONING ON THEM. STICK THEM IN THE OVEN. SORT OF SET IT AND FORGET IT. I THINK I DID PRETTY GOOD. THE GOATS HEADS ARE LOOKING GOOD. THIS DRIVES A GUY LIKE ME CRAZY -- A JELLY JAR LIKE THIS THAT'S ALMOST OUT OF JELLY. POUR SOME APPLE CIDER VINEGAR INTO IT, SHAKE IT UP. IT'S SORT OF THE PERFECT SALAD DRESSING. IT'S A GREAT MARINADE. IT'S ACTUALLY A GREAT DIP, IT'S WHAT I CALL MY DRIPPINGS JAR. &gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT THERE'S MORE TO A ROMANTIC DINNER THAN JUST GOAT HEADS. &gt;&gt; DRYER LINT IS MAYBE ONE OF THE GREAT UNTAPPED RESOURCES OF OUR TIME. I CALL IT CHEAPSKATE'S VELVET. I LIKE TO USE IT TO START MY FIREPLACE. NOTHING LIKE THE SIZZLE OF DRYER LINT. PUT IT IN YOUR COMPOSE PILE. IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD, THEY ACTUALLY WEAVE WITH DRYER LINT. I'M REALLY GONNA ROLL OUT THE RED CARPET AND IMPRESS HER. I'M GONNA SERVE A LITTLE WINE. I GOT THE BOXED WINE, BUT SINCE IT'S A SPECIAL OCCASION, I THOUGHT I WOULD...RECANT IT INTO A FANCY WINE BOTTLE. I MEAN, YOU SEE A BOTTLE LIKE THIS, I MEAN, YOU'RE THINKING -- I DON'T KNOW -- $40 A BOTTLE. NOBODY KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE, REALLY. I THINK LOVE IS IN THE AIR WHEN SHE SEES THIS, ME BREAKING OUT THE GOOD STUFF. YOU KNOW, I GOT MY DRIPPING SAUCE HERE. I'M GONNA ACTUALLY USE IT ON THE GOATS' HEADS. &gt;&gt; HI, HONEY. I'M HOME. &gt;&gt; HEY, BABY. HOW WAS YOUR DAY? &gt;&gt; GOOD. WHAT ABOUT YOU? &gt;&gt; GOOD, GOOD. &gt;&gt; SOMETHING SMELLS GOOD FOR DINNER. &gt;&gt; HUH? [ CHUCKLES ] &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; THE GOOD STUFF. &gt;&gt; OH, WOW. &gt;&gt; [ CHUCKLES ] OH, I JUST THOUGHT WE OUGHT TO CELEBRATE A LITTLE BIT. &gt;&gt; OH, OKAY. &gt;&gt; SO, GO HAVE A SEAT, AND I'M GONNA BRING OUT THE MAIN DISH. &gt;&gt; I NEVER KNOW QUITE WHAT MIGHT BE ON THE DINNER TABLE WHEN I GET HOME. &gt;&gt; Narrator: AFTER SURVIVING A WHOLE WEEK OF JEFF'S FISCAL FASTING, DENISE HAS ONE MORE CHEAPSKATE DINNER TO SIT THROUGH. &gt;&gt; SURPRISE! &gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT? &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] I GOT SOME GOAT HEADS. I GOT A REALLY GOOD PRICE ON THEM. &gt;&gt; OH. [ CHUCKLES ] &gt;&gt; GOATS' HEADS. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT'S DISGUSTING. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER TRIED IT, OF COURSE. POUR YOU SOME VINO? &gt;&gt; SURE. WHY NOT? &gt;&gt; ONLY THE BEST. YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL THE GOOD STUFF. IT POURS SO MUCH NICER. &gt;&gt; [ Laughing ] OH, MY GOSH, THAT TAKES UP YOUR WHOLE PLATE. &gt;&gt; I HAD TO GET THE EXTRA-BIG PLATE. &gt;&gt; IT'S SMILING AT ME. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] YOU SURE YOU WON'T JOIN ME? &gt;&gt; NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL LET YOU HAVE BOTH OF THEM. &gt;&gt; MMM. THERE'S THE TONGUE. THAT'S THE BEST PART, REALLY. &gt;&gt; [ Laughing ] A DELICACY, I GUESS. &gt;&gt; VERY INTERESTING TEXTURE, PERFECT FLAVORS. &gt;&gt; IT SEEMS YOU MUST BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE TEETH. &gt;&gt; I'M SURE YOU CAN. I MEAN, EVENTUALLY -- &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU HAVE A COUPLE MISSING THAT YOU CAN -- [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; EVENTUALLY, IF I NEED DENTURES, WE KNOW WHERE TO TURN. [ BOTH LAUGH ] &gt;&gt; OH, I SEE WE HAVE A FIRE IN OUR FIREPLACE, THE FIRST ONE OF THE SEASON. &gt;&gt; YEP. I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, SORT OF A ROMANTIC EVENING -- YOU, ME, TWO GOATS' HEADS. &gt;&gt; AND FIRE LINT. &gt;&gt; AND DRYER LINT. &gt;&gt; [ Laughing ] RIGHT, DRYER LINT -- WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK? &gt;&gt; WE GET ACCESS TO THE BRAIN THROUGH HERE. &gt;&gt; WELL, I THINK IT'S STICKING ITS TONGUE OUT AT ME. [ BOTH LAUGH ] &gt;&gt; PROBABLY AT ME. &gt;&gt; I WILL LET HIM EAT 'CAUSE I TELL HIM THERE HAS TO BE AT LEAST ONE PERSON READY TO DIAL 911 JUST IN CASE HE HAS FOOD POISONING, AND I'M THE ONE WHO'S PREPARED TO DRIVE HIM TO THE HOSPITAL. &gt;&gt; AND, OF COURSE, THE REAL DELICACY IS THE EYE. &gt;&gt; I'LL TRUST YOU ON THAT ONE. &gt;&gt; MMM. WELL, HERE'S TO A GREAT FISCAL FAST. WE ENDED ON A HIGH NOTE. HERE'S LOOKING AT YOU. &gt;&gt; [ CHUCKLES ] &gt;&gt; Narrator: COMING UP, WE MEET A CHEAPSKATE WHO SAVED OVER $20,000 ON HIS WEDDING... BUT IS SO CHEAP, HE'S ALSO WILLING TO GET EXTREME TO SAVE JUST 60 CENTS. &gt;&gt; &quot;ONE, TWO! AND THROUGH AND THROUGH, THE VORPAL BLADE WENT SNICKER-SNACK!&quot; &gt;&gt; Narrator: OUR NEXT CHEAPSKATE TAKES US TO BRANSON, MISSOURI. &gt;&gt; MY NAME IS JORDAN MEDERICH. MY DAD IS A PASTOR, AND MY MOM IS A TEACHER. I GUESS YOU COULD SAY KIND OF HUMBLE BEGINNINGS. AND SO THAT KIND OF INSPIRED ME TO CREATE MY OWN VERSION OF SAVING MONEY, WHICH ENDED UP BEING BARTERING. I'M REALLY NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING FREE. I JUST WANT TO PROVIDE SOMETHING VALUABLE TO YOU. INSTEAD OF EARNING A VERY LARGE SALARY AT A JOB THAT I HAVE TO WORK REALLY HARD AT, I CAN BARTER AND LITERALLY DOUBLE MY SALARY. SO, THEN HE SHAKES MY HAND RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE, AND WE GOT OURSELVES A DEAL. MY WIFE, JULIA, MARRIED INTO IT. &gt;&gt; BEING MARRIED TO AN EXTREME BARTERER IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN ANY LIFESTYLE THAT I HAVE EVER BEEN EXPOSED TO. &gt;&gt; Narrator: JORDAN PREFERS TO AVOID SPENDING MONEY, PERIOD, AND DOES JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING HE CAN TO SAVE A BUCK. &gt;&gt; I INVENTED A SYSTEM THAT I HAVE FOUND TO BE VERY PERSUASIVE AND VERY POWERFUL. STEP ONE -- AFFIRMATION. YOU COMPLIMENT THE BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; HI. &gt;&gt; HI, THERE. HOW ARE YOU? &gt;&gt; I'M DOING GREAT. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S YOUR NAME? &gt;&gt; I'M LORI. &gt;&gt; HI, LORI. &gt;&gt; HI. &gt;&gt; I LOVE THIS SHOP. I COME HERE ALL THE TIME. STEP TWO -- WHEN YOU HIT THEM WITH A BARTER. I'M WONDERING -- ARE YOU A FAN OF POETRY? &gt;&gt; IF IT'S GOOD. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU A POETRY FAN? &gt;&gt; IF IT'S GOOD. &gt;&gt; WELL, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU GUYS A LITTLE SOMETHING THAT HOPEFULLY YOU WILL JUST SO LOVINGLY ALLOW ME TO CONSUME A RASPBERRY DOUGHNUT. &gt;&gt; Narrator: AS A LINE OF PEOPLE WAIT BEHIND HIM, JORDAN BARTERS FOR A 60-CENT DOUGHNUT. &gt;&gt; &quot;BEWARE THE JABBERWOCK, MY SON! THE JAWS THAT BITE, THE CLAWS THAT CATCH! BEWARE THE JUBJUB BIRD, AND SHUN THE FRUMIOUS BANDERSNATCH! ONE, TWO! ONE, TWO! AND THROUGH AND THROUGH THE VORPAL BLADE WENT SNICKER-SNACK! COME TO MY ARMS, MY BEAMISH BOY!&quot; &gt;&gt; WE JUST WANT TO GET A DOUGHNUT. SOME GUY GOES ON A BIG OLD CRAZE. WE'RE LIKE, &quot;OKAY, HURRY UP. WE'RE HUNGRY.&quot; &gt;&gt; I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS DEFINITELY WORTH A RASPBERRY. &gt;&gt; EVERY ONE OF US BARTER EVERY DAY, ANYWAY. IT'S CALLED MONEY. &gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT JORDAN DOESN'T JUST BARTER FOR DOUGHNUTS. HE GOES AFTER BIG-TICKET ITEMS, TOO. &gt;&gt; OUR WEDDING IS THE BIGGEST THING HE'S EVER DONE. HE GOT US A WEDDING THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND JUST WAY OUT OF OUR PRICE RANGE. &gt;&gt; Narrator: HE BARTERED FOR EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR WEDDING -- THE DRESS, THE TUXEDOS, AND EVEN THE CHAPEL. HAD THE COUPLE PAID FULL PRICE, THEIR BIG DAY SHOULD HAVE COST THEM OVER $22,000. &gt;&gt; THE TOTAL COST OF OUR WEDDING, AFTER WE HAD EVERYTHING TAKEN CARE OF, WAS ABOUT $1,825. &gt;&gt; Narrator: AFTER SAVING BIG BUCKS ON HIS OWN WEDDING, JORDAN WANTS TO HELP HIS NEWLY ENGAGED FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; OUR FRIENDS JONATHAN AND ANGELA -- THEY'VE HELPED US OUT A TON WITH OUR WEDDING. ANGELA HELPED US WITH THE PLANNING, AND THEN JONATHAN AND HIS MUSICAL GROUP SANG FOR US. SO, WE'D LOVE TO PAY THEM BACK. &gt;&gt; Narrator: JONATHAN AND ANGELA WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY, BUT THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. SO JORDAN IS GOING TO TEACH THEM HOW TO BARTER. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S REALLY SPECIAL ABOUT JORDAN IS HE'S DOING IT AS A FAVOR TO US. HE'S HELPING US LEARN HOW TO DO THIS BECAUSE IT WORKS FOR HIM AND HE WANTS TO SHARE THAT SKILL WITH US. &gt;&gt; Narrator: THEIR FIRST STOP IS A CAKE SHOP, WHERE THEY HOPE TO GET A CAKE AND AN OUTDOOR SPACE FOR THE PARTY, ALL FOR FREE. &gt;&gt; I'D NEVER THOUGHT OF USING MY VOCAL TALENT AS A BARTERING TOOL TO GET SOMEONE TO GIVE ME SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU A FAN OF OPERA? &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; DO YOU LIKE OPERA? &gt;&gt; I LIKE -- I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT WAGNER, BUT MOST OF THE ITALIAN OPERAS. &gt;&gt; SHE KNOWS THE NAMES. THAT MEANS SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; IF I SANG, WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO KNOCK THE PRICE DOWN A LITTLE? &gt;&gt; Narrator: TO GET THE CAKE AND THE VENUE FOR FREE, JONATHAN PULLS OUT ALL THE STOPS. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WHAT I ACTUALLY HAVE IN MY POCKET HERE -- SORRY. I HAVE TO REACH DOWN AND GET IT. I HAVE TWO FREE TICKETS TO SEE THE 12 IRISH TENORS. &gt;&gt; OH, ARE YOU IN THAT SHOW? &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S ACTUALLY THE SHOW THAT I'M A PART OF HERE IN BRANSON. SO, I COULD OFFER YOU THAT FREE TICKETS THERE AND THEN SING THE ARIA FOR YOU HERE, BRING YOU A CD. &gt;&gt; I THINK I'D PROBABLY HAVE TO TAKE THAT. &gt;&gt; WHERE WOULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE SEATED FOR THE PERFORMANCE? [ LAUGHTER ] MA IL MIO MISTERO e CHIUSO IN ME VINCERO &gt;&gt; BRAVO! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; SHE SEEMED REALLY, REALLY HAPPY THAT I WAS STANDING IN HER BAKERY AND SINGING AN OPERA ARIA TO HER. &gt;&gt; [ CHUCKLES ] &gt;&gt; AND SHE WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO SAY, &quot;SURE, I'LL DO THIS FOR YOU.&quot; &gt;&gt; THEY JUST KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE BALLPARK. IT REALLY IMPRESSED ME. LITERALLY, EVERYBODY WON. &gt;&gt; THANKS. &gt;&gt; Narrator: WITH THE FOOD AND LOCATION SET FOR THE PARTY, JORDAN IS HOPING TO MAKE ONE LAST BARTER. UNWILLING TO SHELL OUT $25 FOR A HAIRCUT, HE TRIES TO MAKE THE SALON AN OFFER THEY CAN'T REFUSE. &gt;&gt; I'M LOOKING FOR A LITTLE TRIMSY ON THE HAIRS. &gt;&gt; LITTLE TRIMSY? &gt;&gt; HEY, ALICIA? CAN YOU DO A TRIM? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; OH, HI, ALICIA. &gt;&gt; HOW ARE YOU? &gt;&gt; NICE TO MEET YOU. HEY, I'M WONDERING -- AND MAYBE THIS INVOLVES ALL YOU GUYS. I'M WONDERING IF I CAN KIND OF TAKE CARE OF THE HAIRCUT AND MAYBE TAKE OUT SOME TRASH OR CLEAN AND SWEEP SOME HAIR FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; I THOUGHT I'D TRY A LITTLE BIT OF A LITTLE BARTERING TECHNIQUE THAT'S, YOU KNOW, SERVICE FOR SERVICE. I THINK THEY WERE DEFINITELY SHOCKED AND A LITTLE SCARED. &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU MIGHT DO TRASH WELL. &gt;&gt; I DO. HAS ANYONE'S LIKE FAMOUS HEAD RESTED ON HERE? &gt;&gt; UM, NOT -- WELL, MAYBE LOCALLY FAMOUS. &gt;&gt; [ GRUNTS ] WHOEVER SAID THIS WAS EASY WAS A JOKER. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE A SMUDGE HERE. JUST WIPE THIS DOWN 'CAUSE WHEN THEY GET OUT OF IT... &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. &gt;&gt; THERE YOU GO. &gt;&gt; WELL, THERE IT IS. &gt;&gt; GOOD JOB. &gt;&gt; NICE. I'VE OFFICIALLY CLEANED THE BED, SWEPT YOUR FLOOR, AND TOOK OUT YOUR TRASH. WOULD THAT WARRANT A LITTLE TRIM? &gt;&gt; OKAY, JORDAN. FAIR ENOUGH. FAIR ENOUGH. A LITTLE TRIM. LITTLE TRIM TIME. &gt;&gt; HE CAME IN HERE, DID A LITTLE HARD WORK FOR US. I RESPECT THE YOUNG MAN FOR GOING OUT AND TRYING TO WORK FOR WHAT HE GETS, AND I WELCOME HIM BACK NEXT TIME. I'LL SAVE THE TRASH FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; ALL DONE. &gt;&gt; NICE! [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] &gt;&gt; WE GOT A VENUE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A $400 COST TO RENT THIS WHOLE PLACE OUT FOR 4 HOURS -- ON TOP OF THAT, THE CAKE. SHE ALSO ALLOWED US TO GET SOME MORE FINGER DESSERTS, AND WE GOT SOME ECLAIRS AND SOME TRUFFLES. AND IT'S COMPLETELY FREE. &gt;&gt; IT'S PERFECT. IT'S EXACTLY US. IT WAS VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT AND PLANNED, AND ALL OUR FAVORITE PEOPLE ARE HERE, SO YOU CAN'T REALLY ASK FOR MUCH MORE. &gt;&gt; LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TO JONATHAN AND ANGELA FUTURE-TO-BE HILL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
