chopsaw blades designed to cut in metal cost anywhere from $40 to $140 so the question is is that $40 blade just as good let's find out in the first test we'll see which blade cuts the fastest through mild steel then we'll see which blade causes the most heat build up we'll see which blade cuts the smoothest finally we'll see if any of the blades can cut through some armor plating at a price of only $43 the least expensive blade we'll be testing is made by satc all the blades will be testing are 14 in in diameter high density carbide teeth designed for cutting metal the blade is designed to cut wood plastic steel Ferris metals and composits laser cut curve maximizes accuracy and reduces noise and vibration the satc blade is made in China 3.58 lb or 1,624 G my own chop saw has a lot of use on it so I went ahead and bought a new chops Saw made by Evolution and it's the model s380 the Max RPM on the evolution is 1,450 RPM so all the blades will work just fine I placed the lever arm on the saw so we can adjust the downward pressure applied to the Blade 2 and 12 lb on the lever arm is very close to 5 lb on the blade let's begin with something very easy for the blades the metal tube is made of mild steel and it's 1 in X 332s of an inch I've already tried 2 and2 lbs and that wasn't enough pressure for the satc with 5 lbs of weight on the lever arm unfortunately the satc can't make the cut so I stopped the test after 30 seconds the metal has cooled down so let's try 7 and 1/2 lb and the satc still struggled to make the cut through the mild steel 16.5 seconds to finally get the job done and the satc caused a lot of heat build up on the workpiece and left a very messy cut at a price price of $48 or just $5 more than the satc is this wind brand the satc has 72 teeth the wind only has 66 ultra thin only 2.4 mm provides clean efficient Cuts perfect for cutting dry steel and metal the wind brand is made in Thailand the wind is lighter than the S satc at 3.27 lb or 1,482 G and a 66 tooth blade made very easy and quick work of the steel tubing and only 0.85 seconds and the blade made a very clean cut and the metal is cool to the touch at a price of$ 668 or $20 more than the wind is this Irwin brand the wind has 66 teeth the Irwin has 80 laser cut antivibration vents keep the blade cool for smooth and accurate Cuts Cuts metal instead of grinding it making a smooth finish anti- Kickback two shoulder reduces dust and Sparks for safer Cuts designed to cut steel pipe threaded rod angle iron and metal studs metal cutting grade carbide teeth with stance impact reduces wear and delivers long life the Irwin blade is made in China and the irn is the heaviest blade yet at 4.03 lb or 1,8 128 G and irin has 80 teeth instead of 66 but still made a quick cut in only 2.02 seconds very nice and smooth looking cut for the Irwin at a price of $82 is this Diablo brand designed for studs angled iron plates bars pipes tubes EMT conduit and threaded Rod instead of using regular carbide for the teeth the Diablo uses a sermat blend it's designed for impact reduces wear and last at the five times longer laser cut stabilizer vents trap noise and vibration for maximum stability keeping it cool and accurate in metal cutting applications the Diablo is made in Italy and the Diablo is the lightest shed at 2.93 lb or 1326 G and the Diablo with 72 teeth is a little bit faster than the Irwin at 1.36 seconds however the Diablo didn't leave quite as clean of a cut compared to the Irwin at a price of $85 is this Linux brand which uses diamonds instead of carbide delivers a thousand or more Cuts without changing the wheel 30 times longer life maintains original wheel diameter throughout the cutting life of the blade does not wear down like bonded blades reducing dust particles for cleaner Workstation designed for steel sheet metal stainless steel rebar cast iron aluminum and non-ferrous Metals the Linux blade is made in Vietnam and the Linux weighs right at 3 lb or 1,362 G and the Linux Diamond blade Cuts quite a bit slower than the carbide blades at 13 seconds to make the cut and a Linux Diamond blade heated up the metal quite a bit and left a pretty messy cut had a price of $87 is this Evolution brand high-grade carbide teeth offering increased durability harden steel body ensures the blade runs trer for longer designed specifically to cut steel 66 to configuration enables fast efficient cuts the evolution is made in Japan and the evolution weighs 3.25 lb or 1,474 G and the 66 to Evolution blade made the fastest cut yet at only 0.75 seconds to take the lead from the win and the evolution made a very nice and clean cut at a price of $92 is this ashin brand most the other blades have 66 to 72 teeth the ashin has 80 specially formulated C six micrograin carbide with titanium lasts longer and leaves burree cut laser cut expansion slots designed to cut steel studs angled iron pipe rebar Channel flat stock and more the ashin blade is made in China and the ashin is the second heaviest blade yet at 4.02 lb or 1,820 G even though the ashon has 80 teeth it's nearly as fast as the evolution at 0.95 seconds very fast and smooth cut for the Ashan and the second most expensive blade will be testing is made by Makita and cost $127 the Makita has a 70 to carbide tip tooth design for cleaner cuts and longer life designed to make cuts and tubing angled iron Channel and non- copper pipe the Makita is made in China the Makita weighs 3.05 lb or 1,384 G and a 7 to Makita blasted through the metal and only 0.6 seconds the fastest time yet very fast and smooth cut by the Makita at a price of $135 the most expensive brand will be testing is made by DeWalt the metal cutting blade has 50% longer life the DeWalt includes 66 carbide teeth precise tip placement for longer life and accurate Cuts crafted with 12% titanium carbide stiff plate design minimizes run out and extends life made in China and the DeWalt weighs 3.22 lb or 1,462 G and the DeWalt moves into a two-way tie for fourth place with the ashin at 0.95 seconds very smooth cut by the dwall those metal C off blades are very expensive so why not just buy an abrasive wheel Instead at a price of $32 for four chopsaw wheels or $8 each is this DeWalt brand the cut off wheels are made of high performance aluminum oxide grain for long life and fast cutting two sheets of fiberglass for durability and safety the duwal cut off wheels are made in Canada and the dwall de braive wheel is the lightest yet at only 1.32 lb or 598 G and the DeWalt abrasive wheel needs quite a bit more downward pressure to cut efficiently with only 2 and2 lbs on the lever arm the DeWalt made the cut in 52 seconds not a very clean cut and the metal definitely needs Deb bird this is just a warm-up round on some very soft metal but the Makita came out on top at 0.6 seconds Evolution was nearly as fast at 0.75 when 0.85 ashin and DeWalt 0.95 seconds let's see how the blades perform on some 3/16 by an inch and a half angle iron beginning with the satc with 7 12 lbs of weight on the lever arm the satc really struggled with the mild steel angle iron a minute and 29 seconds to make the cut the sound meter in the particle counter is 4 ft away from the saw the blade is very loud at 11 18.6 DB the air inside the shop started off at under 100 small particles which were around the size of 1 Micron the number on the right indicates the number of large particles which are around 5 microns in size and the satc created a lot of dust at 1,260 small and 144 large particles and the satc caused a lot of heat build up on the workpiece and left a very messy cut unfortunately the satc experienced some chipped teeth from the mild steel the dust has settled so let's test the wind with only 2 and2 lbs on the tester 3.95 seconds on the first cut and the wind is a little bit faster on the second cut at 3.64 seconds 3.74 seconds on the third cut for an average speed of 3.8 seconds and the wind is a lot quieter than the satc at 107.7 DB there's a lot less dust in the air at 521 small particles and 55 large nice and clean cut with the win testing the IR with 2 and 12 lbs on the tester and the irn needs about 2 seconds longer than the win at 5.72 seconds on the first cut Andy irin made the second cut at 5.72 seconds again the same as the first cut 5.11 seconds on the third cut for an average cut speed of 5.5 seconds the Irwin is a little bit louder than the win at 108.5 DB but made less dust 366 small and 46 large particles a very nice and clean cut with the Irwin testing the Diablo with 2 and 1/2 lb and the Diablo is about the same speed as the Irwin at 5.82 seconds on the first cut and the Diablo is very consistent with his cutting speed at 5.72 seconds on the second cut and it's 5.72 seconds again on the third cut for an average speed of 5.8 seconds and the Diablo makes the least about a noise yet at only 103.4 DB 574 small and 43 large particles very nice and clean cut with the Diablo with 2 and2 lbs on the Linux Diamond blade it took 53 seconds to make the cut so let's go ahead and try 5 lbs and the Linux did a lot better at just under 17 seconds to make the cut the metal is cooled off so let's try 72 lb which is about 15 lb of pressure on the blade and the Linux made the cut in 11 seconds the Linux Diamond blade is pretty noisy at 115.7 DB the Linux Diamond also puts a lot of dust in the air at 1300 small and over 100 large particles and the Linux made a pretty messy cut with 2 and 12 lbs on the evolution the blade is just as fast as the win at 3.95 seconds on the first pass and the evolution made a second cut in just 3.49 seconds 4 seconds on the third pass for a three cut average of 3.8 seconds the same as the win 110. n DB 497 small and 45 large particles very clean cut with the evolution with 2.5 lbs on the saw the asham is the fastest blade yet at only 3.13 seconds and it's even faster on the second pass at 2.78 seconds 2.93 seconds on the third pass for an average of 2.9 seconds 105.4 DB 790 small and 53 large particles very goodlooking cut by the ashin with 2 and2 lbs of Makita is almost as fast as the ashin at 3.23 seconds on the first pass the Mak is a little bit slower on the second cut at 3.49 seconds almost the same speed on the third cut at 3.44 seconds to move into second place behind the ashin and Makita is a little bit louder than average at 11.9 DB but very little dust at 41435 very clean cut with the Makita with 2.5 lb the DeWalt is just as fast as the Makita at 3.18 seconds almost identical cut speed on the second pass at 3.23 seconds 3.54 seconds on the third pass to move into second place behind the Ashland and the DWT is very loud at 11 15.3 DB 444 small and 36 large particles very clean cut with a DWT let's start off with 72 lb with the DeWalt abrasive wheel and the DeWalt abrasive wheel made the cut in 8 seconds with 72 lb of weight on the saw the abrasive wheel makes less noise than most of the blades at 103.7 DB but what a Dusty mess 2,857 small and over 500 large particles so the ashin came out on top with an average cut speed of 2.9 seconds DeWalt finish in second at 3.3 Makita 3.4 win and evolution 3.8 seconds looking at just the small particles the Irwin makes the least amount of dust at 366 Makita performed well at 414 DeWalt 444 Evolution 497 and win 521 some of these blades claim they can cut through rebar stainless and other types of hardened steel so let's see how the blades perform making just one pass through some 1/4 in x 2 in 4140 I'll set up the saw remove right at 1/4 in of Steel and let's see how hot the metal becomes with right at 2.5 lbs of weight the wind started off very fast but slowed down a lot towards the end of the cut 9.38 seconds and the metal started off pretty cool at 70deg F and went all the way up to 108.4 the wind blade did experience several chip teeth with 2 and2 lb of pressure the airwind started off pretty fast and really slowed down near the end of the cut 11 seconds to make the cut and the metal temperature made it to 113.5 de F the irin appears to have some very minor wear and tear to the teeth with 2 and2 lbs of pressure the Diablo is the fastest cutting blade yet making the cut in 8.97 seconds the metal stayed relatively cool at 109.5deg and a carbide teeth on the Diablo look nearly as good as new with 7.5 lbs of pressure the Linux diamond made the cut in 99 seconds but the metal made it to about 214deg before the adhesive on the tape lost grip and there's still plenty of diamonds left with 2.5 lb of pressure the evolution takes the lead from the Diablo making the cut in 5.77 seconds and the metal temperature only M it to 97.5 de only a couple of Chip teeth with the evolution and the ashin is even faster than the evolution at 4.76 seconds and the metal stayed relatively cool at 102deg and there's very little visible wear with the ashin blade with 2.5 lb of pressure the Makita moves into second place behind the ashin at 5.26 seconds the metal only made it to 97.5 de the same as the evolution just a minor doing with the Makita Blade with 2.5 lbs of pressure the DeWalt started off quickly but lost speed near the end of the cut 8.77 seconds and the metal made it up to 114.4 De the DWT did experience several chip teeth with 7.5 lounds on the DeWalt abrasive wheel the DeWalt made the cut in 9.83 seconds and the metal went well past 200deg and melted the tape so the ashon made the fastest cut in 4.76 seconds but the Makita is nearly as fast at 5.26 Evolution finished in third at 5.77 seconds DeWalt 8.77 and Diablo 8.97 seconds the evolution in the Makita made the coolest cut with the metal only reaching 97.5 de the arcelin teeth carves a wider path which caused a little bit more heat buildup at 102deg F all of the blades with caride teeth kept the metal temperature relatively cool the diamond and the DeWalt EMB bracer wheel both created a lot more heat now that we've challenged the blaz let Let's test them again on the angle iron to see if they lost some cutting speed with 2.5 lbs of weight the wind averaged 3.74 seconds cutting through the angle iron before the piece of 4140 and the wind took twice as long this time at 7.64 seconds so the wind definitely experienced quite a bit of damage and the Irwin averaged 5.5 seconds and only needed 9.6% more time to make the cut 6.03 seconds so the Irwin is still in great shape and the Diablo averaged 5.8 seconds before making the cut through the 4140 steel and the Diablo only needed 3.1% longer at 5 .98 seconds very impressive with three times the amount of pressure as the other brands the lenux diamond started off very slow at 11 seconds and held the same speed this time at 11 seconds the evolution is a very fast cutting blade and just made the fastest cut yet at 4.96 seconds but it did take 30% longer than the original time the ashin is even faster than the evolution at 4.4 seconds but it needed 51% longer to make the cut this time and the Makita moves into the lead over the ashin at 3.74 seconds and only needed 10% longer to make the cut this time the dwell is fast at 5.01 seconds but it did slow down quite a bit needing 51% longer this time around not surprisingly with 7 and a half pounds of weight the abrasive wheel made the cut just as fast this time at 8 seconds after cutting to 4140 steel the Makita is now the fastest cutting blade at 3.74 seconds the Ashen finished in second at 4.4 Evolution 4.96 DeWalt 5.01 and Diablo 5.98 seconds another way to compare durability is to consider the original performance compared to how the blades perform after coming in contact with the 4140 steel and the duwal abrasive wheel and the lenux diamond didn't experience any significant performance change and the Diablo only needed 3.1% longer to make the cut Irwin 99.6% and Makita 10 these blades are definitely not designed for cutting through ar400 steel but let's go ahead and do it anyway let's go and skip the satc since it doesn't appear to be designed for cutting metal to keep the metal from work hardening I'll have to apply just enough pressure to keep the blade moving and the wind took almost 40 seconds to make the cut so it definitely experienced a lot of damage and the Irwin made very easy work of the ar400 making the cut in only 17.18 seconds and the Diablo is nearly as fast as the Irwin at 17.39% the cut at 31.75 seconds and the DeWalt abrasive wheel made the cut in 29.267562 3 seconds with 7 12 lbs of pressure the lenux diamond blade made the cut in 13.7 9 seconds and the evolution experienced quite a bit of damage 177.23 seconds to make the cut and the Ashen makes the fastest cut yet at 11.35 seconds and the Makita experienced a lot of damage from the ar400 but still made the cut in 19.26% is nearly as fast at 12.57 seconds Linux diamond 13.79% had to choose this one blade I would definitely go with the Makita but it is very expensive also I really like the irn and the Diablo both of those blades held up to quite a bit of abuse before they begin to fail now ultimately these blades are not designed for high carbon steel so if I had to cut high carbon steel I would definitely use an abrasive wheel all the videos in this channel including this one are viewers suggested so if you have a video idea I hope you'll take time to leave a
