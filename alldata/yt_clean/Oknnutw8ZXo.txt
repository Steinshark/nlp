Hello everyone, welcome to HowFixit. Today, we're 5 Pro and comparing it to the PlayStation 5 cooling systems, power, design Before we start, here's a list of tools required for the PS5 Pro: Tweezers I've included links to all these I recommend using a magnetic mat to organize different sizes, so it's important to keep track losing screws; they'll all be securely attached Disassembly by clips. Lift the front edge to release them. fan. Disconnect the fan cable, then to remove the four screws securing the fan. At first glance, the PS5 Pro fan appears similar design. However, the PS5 Pro's fan is slightly capacity, allowing it to push more air through the particularly beneficial for the PS5 Pro, as it may Additionally, the enhanced cooling could help making the system quieter overall. allowing easy dust cleaning without The expansion slot still supports multiple After removing the next cover, we have CMOS Battery that covers the CMOS battery, making it quick you only need to remove one screw with a Phillips battery can cause the system clock to reset, which on its internal clock to verify game ownership and the system might struggle to validate these with an internet connection. Although CMOS fail sooner. In contrast, the PS5 Slim requires Note on Warranty Stickers The warranty sticker conceals a cover. The PS5 Pro hardware warranty is and removing this sticker may void you're protected by the Magnuson-Moss Warranty your warranty. Similar laws exist in New Zealand, and the European Union. Elsewhere, Disassembly remove the covers, and unscrew the two screws. The CMOS battery holder is on a removable damaged. In the PS5 Slim, the battery Disconnect the antenna cables and set them aside. and the metal bracket, so we'll need Using a plastic pry tool, carefully The heatsink is attached with a thermal elastic. When reassembling, I'll show you how to Remove five screws from the metal cover Use the point of a spudger to push the the latch and carefully pull the Next, unscrew the top metal plate. plate. Work your way around the perimeter to separate the plate because thermal pads Comparing the Top Metal Plates The PS5 Pro's top metal plate features and an additional bottom heatsink, whereas the PS5 the heat pipe on the PS5 Slim directly contacts Back Sides Motherboard Comparison motherboards. The back sides of both boards are a NAND memory chip. Both boards have 16GB of GDDR6 PS5 Pro motherboard includes an additional 2GB of system. This means that the PS5 Pro reserves the PS5 Slim shares its 16GB of GDDR6 between Let's continue disassembling to housing and compare the front sides. tension bracket on the motherboard, pressure. Avoid fully unscrewing one side Remove two more screws securing the mainboard. motherboard with a spudger, separating Front Sides Motherboard Comparison Now, let's take a look at the front sides the PS5 Pro is its GPU, which features Slim. It also boasts memory that's 28% faster, sequences up to 45% faster overall. This marks perspective, the PS5 Pro's GPU compared to the 10.28 TFLOPS in the base PS5 Slim. thermal conductivity, and this liquid metal is pouch to keep it securely on the chip's surface. NAND chips, as well as the same input/output Comparing the Cooling System cooling system. If you look closely at the you'll notice surface ridges. These protrusions helping to keep it evenly distributed Pro is positioned vertically. This metal pooling at the bottom of the silicon In contrast, the PS5 Slim's heatsink when used vertically, the liquid metal in the to overheat. The addition of ridges in the PS5 If you have other thoughts on the purpose of these When comparing the cooling systems, the PS5 even though both models feature similarly sized for faster and more even heat transfer from maintain lower, stable temperatures and prevents enabling the PS5 Pro to handle the increased without throttling performance, thereby improving In terms of weight, the cooling systems The PS5 Pro cooling system weighs 609 grams. This makes the Pro version's Power Supply and more powerful than the Slim's 372 watts. while the PS5 Slim has the model number ADP-400GR. is universal. These power supplies can voltages, allowing them to be used globally Power button board with USB-C ports The front panel contains antennas and These two boards are very similar, Conclusion and we can sum it up. The PS5 Pro is designed making it more suited for high-performance and Pro's taller fan and additional heat pipes which is important given its more powerful potentially quieter operation, as the system may Maintenance-wise, the PS5 Pro offers easier while the Slim requires full disassembly. resilience compared to the Slim's soldered The Pro's cooling system includes a reducing the risk of liquid metal concern reported by some PS5 Slim users. heat pipes in the Pro allow for better enhancing performance and system longevity. efficient model, the PS5 Pro is built with and easier maintenance features, Reassembly When reassembling, you can reuse the liquid metal evenly over both surfaces with a lint-free swab. least five years before its performance starts However, if you need to replace it, check out my When installing the mainboard, pay close to connect to the power supply. Ensure indicating the mainboard is properly seated in Next, position the bracket with the fit into their designated cutouts. the plastic one, aligning the screw alternate between them, turning each pressure. Avoid fully tightening one screw When installing the metal plate, ensure Missing thermal pads may lead to overheating. damaged, or dried-out pads; a link to Thermal Secure the metal plate with screws. Insert the cable into its socket, set Attach the antenna cables to their original When we removed this heatsink, we disrupted can attempt to reinstall the heatsink with the as it should still transfer heat effectively. using Thermal Putty or a similar high-conductivity (measured in watts per meter-kelvin)--the material transfers heat.
