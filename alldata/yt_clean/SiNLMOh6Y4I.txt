I'm the one holding the meeting. - And this blouse is - Yeah, the blouse from Laos - The blouse from Laos, baby. - And what's a blouse? - A feminine top. - You love topping? - Yeah, what's the secret - A little prayer.

It says Jujubee is one of the most beloved &quot;Drag - Who said that? Isn't that sweet? I wrote the card. - You have your secretary &quot;Boop, boop, boop, boop.&quot; - Yeah, Amanda's over there just typing. - Totally - You have competed how many - Oh, so many times, and I'm so grateful that you finally asked me to be here. I've been waiting outside - You have, people are I was like, &quot;It's fine. She's fine.&quot; Actually, I heard that and then got the call and - Girl, I would go to an - (laughs) That's the spirit. Juju, how's life? I'm grateful for everything. I can't wait to compete And I'm actually wearing a wig - Do you do a lot of '60s - I wear anything that makes - You look rich. - Are there a lot of rich secretaries? - Yes, they (beep) the boss. True, and you have been on What? What is it? - Maybe my neck's lost weight. - It's true, when you lose weight, you don't realize the neck 'cause you're very trim now. - Am I? (Juju chuckles) - So are you. - Skinny girl. - [Trixie] God, the last time was &quot;Queen of the Universe.&quot; Let's talk about it. - Why don't we just have a discussion? (Trixie laughs) - [Trixie] I don't know There's a lot of people that day, all right? - [Jujubee] It's totally I was there for like 74 seconds. - You stuck around in What'd you do while you were there? - Oh my gosh, we ate some good ass food. - In London? I doubt it. London has great food. - They're watching. - That's a good point. - I've told this story many times but for &quot;The Pit Stop,&quot; can you we did this college gig. - Where I did &quot;Supermodel&quot; by RuPaul. - It's something that I'll never forget because it was one of the And both of us were standing back there, trying to pick a song, and &quot;Let's pick a RuPaul song.&quot; - Right. To walk out to. - Neither of us knew - I, gun to my head, thought it started, &quot;You better work.&quot; - That's what I thought too. do do. - That's what I thought it was. - But he found that version. - He found the deep cut extended, &quot;Once upon a time there and you and I are like. - And I turn over to you and I just go, &quot;Little Black girl?&quot; - So then I just walked out and was like. - &quot;Good evening.&quot; This is, yes, that's me.&quot; It was great. - And I don't think they'll - [Trixie] We're on All Stars Nine. What do you think of this cast of Queens? - Amazing, fantastic talent. - [Jujubee] There's not one queen on there that I do not want to see. - You competed against - Shannel, very easy to manipulate. She's a big sweetheart. And in a competition setting, sometimes you can plant little seeds and kind of get in her mind. - Right. the girls are doing now. Back when we started competing, - No! that type of competition. - We were thinking like, We're gonna serve our best.&quot; But now, you're convincing and that you're on each other's side and then you just chop her. - Last week we saw Gottmik and decide to cut off Angeria, who previously won episode one. Gottmik now has won the that she's been in. That's pretty impressive, though. - Mm-hmm. to win a ball, you think? Why does she make it look so easy? - Gottmik's one of those queens where you aren't actually threatened at first and then she's really sneaky. She just comes, she shows - Gottmik is kind of And so in a competition, you go, &quot;Oh, well she's just and wait for that untucked drink.&quot; And then you're like, &quot;Oh right. This person is a really great artist.&quot; - [Jujubee] Mm-hmm. He's fantastic. - Does it make sense to cut What would you do? - I think I would really - Oh. confusing people. - Never let 'em know your next move. - Yeah. Am I gonna go left or right? I don't know. - I'm gonna go over here. - Well it's hard 'cause it's a sisterhood. On All Stars, a lot of these girls have real years long friendships. - Totally. Totally. &quot;Ooh, that's my friend. I don't wanna block my friend.&quot; - But they're still gonna be there. - They're still gonna be there. - And everybody's working for charity. - It's not like All Stars and say your dreams are crushed. - I just talked about my cats. (cat meows) - Well, one's in heaven. - Mister. Priss is still around. - How old was Mister? - 15? fat tuxedo kitty cat. (purrs) - Let's dedicate this episode to Mister. (cat meows) Once again, Jorgeous said Why is she telling her this? - I think she wants that - Mm. Right. I think Jorgeous is maybe and dumb just to kind of confuse people. - Mm-hmm. a lot smarter than she - I think everyone's And so everyone's like, &quot;Is Is this the time to block Nina?&quot; Which in a way is a compliment. It's not good to be the best every time. - Well, look at me! I'm I love &quot;Drag Race&quot; because I get to remove All Stars One was the for that long. So it was kind of like I never said this out And what queen doesn't love the camera. - Ooh. Ah. - Ooh. Ah. - [Trixie] At the top of the who are close, realize as a Snatch Game character. With the two Liberace's, my fear would be, &quot;God, now I have to be the best one.&quot; - Right, well you know, Miss Shannel said, &quot;I brought a nose.&quot; - Girl, it was like, &quot;I know &quot;Well I have ruffles.&quot; &quot;Well I have a purple coat.&quot; &quot;Well I have sparkly shoes.&quot; And then Shannel said, prosthetics out.&quot; - What would your reaction &quot;I'm also doing Eartha - I would've been like, &quot;That's fine 'cause mine's gonna be killer.&quot; - Did you really feel that confident? - Well, I always sell the (Jujubee laughs) - What would you do? - Realistically, I would chicken out and pick a different character. - Oh, I don't think that's who you are. - I would be like, the girl with the mug.&quot; - From &quot;The Brewster Projects.&quot; - From &quot;The Brewster Projects.&quot; So Ru enters and of course It's the favorite challenge. It's Snatch Game, specifically - I love watching Snatch Game. I don't love doing Snatch Game. - Okay. We had no idea what it was about. We thought we had to look like the people. - You were in the first one. It's literally a comedy challenge. You just have to be funny. You have to volley back - And you know, RuPaul loves to laugh. - Yeah. RuPaul will crack up. Well you were safe in season - I was safe every single time. - And then for Snatch Game of Love, you really turned it. - [Trixie] Do gay men just - Yeah, they do, and I don't what I was gonna answer. I just answered. - But that's what made it good, Juju. You were listening to what - Right. and do her voice watching her? - Over and over. There's that interview where she's outside and the dog's barking. The one where they're like. - &quot;For what?&quot; - &quot;I want you to love me.&quot; - It's also kind of giving Edna - It's, well. She was an incredible lady. - I wanted to honor this talented woman. And the dress I was wearing was $9. - Hmm. - Ooh. What's that other one? You know. about cheap clothing? This is Off the Rack. - This is actually custom. - Yes. - Can you find this off the rack somewhere with these shoulders? - Maybe not. - Maybe at like a Renaissance fair or like at Medieval Times. - If you ever get to a point in life where you wanna be an old slut, go to the Ren Fair. Baby. - There's grandmas with their tits out. Some of the guys wear - Really? - Well I'm vegan and gluten-free. Do they have anything? - You don't have to swallow. So Gottmik won the season 13 Snatch Game. I mean, do you think that gives you a little - [Jujubee] Absolutely. Everybody needs to watch out for Gottmik. She's so quiet. - [Jujubee] And then she's - If I did All Stars again, I think I would go into Snatch Game braver because I'm like, I have already So anything can be better. We start to hear some of the characters that the queens are playing. So what are some of your initial thoughts about these choices before we get into it? - Jorgeous as John Linguini, - [Trixie] I think she - [Jujubee] So he's Italian now. - John Leguizamiano. - Yeah, I don't know, it's and talk about a character - [Jujubee] What's her famous line? &quot;If there's a- - [Jujubee and Trixie] Snowstorm tonight, he's going on on my tires.&quot; (Jujubee laughs) When Gottmik said she's doing a dog actor, I said, &quot;You better pick - I think it's smart. Because we don't know 'cause dogs don't talk. - Dogs talk to me all the time. - I thought you were a cat person? (cat meows) - Aw. into my yard asking me for nuts? - Well they heard that you have them. Ru tells them that this are each winning two badges, one to keep and one to How do you think that affects the game? Giving away the badge? - Roxxxy brings up a good point. You could kind of screw because it could be a good Because when you have the most badges, you become the target. - I love that Roxxxy Andrews a new leaf, but she's also like, &quot;Oh no, I already thought through to do this.&quot; - First of all, what do you We got Kevin and David. - I would leave a snail - You and Raven are kind of soulmates. Do you think that if David and you were single and it would've been fireworks? - Hell the (beep) no. Raven really is truly aging in reverse. - Mm-hmm. more fancy and rich. Do you like David's Luigi mustache? - I do. - I really do. - And I love very manicured It gives me, yeah, like Angeria is Marla Gibbs. - I love. Didn't know who it was. Had to ask. Roxxxy's Tasha Salad. and I had to ask you. - Well, when I saw the &quot;There's no way she's doing There's no way.&quot; - It would be like Alaska It's like, &quot;Oh.&quot; - Yeah. I'm gonna do - I would do Juju at the with the lash. &quot;Oh my God.&quot; That one. Yes. - [Trixie] Which by the (record scratches) - I'm just saying, you - Do y'all hear this (beep). (Trixie laughs) - You are so good in that - Oh, thank you. I think of you immediately. - Really? - So you're walking up and they do play it at that store. - What a sexy, intense song to buy like vegan mustard. (Jujubee vocalizes) - Yes, you were great. - You were great. - She was great. - [Trixie] So Shannel's Liberace, what do you think of - Shannel is approaching Where she's becoming who Liberace is. - She's single white female-ing Liberace. - And she looks like BenDeLaCreme. - Right, she sat down with that black wig and I was like, &quot;Okay. So we're doing BenDeLaCreme - Okay. - Which I don't mind. She also had the blue eyes, the nose. I mean she really was like, in the witness protection program. You know, like body double. It was fierce. And then we got Jorgeous - Well, that's, when you - Leguiza-no. - I wasn't thrilled with the hair choice. I just thought, &quot;Wouldn't - I would've done the curly wig. I don't know if the look itself screamed the character for me. She looked beautiful. It screamed normal woman- - Going to the bodega. Yes. Who stood out to you in this group? - [Jujubee] It was definitely Marla Gibbs - [Trixie] Angeria is so funny. Everything was either a - And she was always in character. Every shot that I saw that she She was in the moment. Even her swaying back That was thoughtful. The part where she was like, We're gonna get on our knees and pray.&quot; - She even knew the momentum of her jokes and where to put the punchline. - You can't teach that You're either born with it or you're not. And she was born with it. So this is definitely something that the girls are gonna have to watch out for because she is funny and - When she started, I went, She lands a big first joke and I was like, &quot;She is just You got RuPaul laughing immediately. - Right, which is what you want. - [Trixie] Yeah. - I'm gonna cross my legs again because I don't want the kids to see my poom poom silhouette. - Where do you think that - Probably down in my vagina. (cat meows) - Do you know what a A (beep) print. Poom poom silhouette. - Sounds like a queen's name. Welcome to the stage, Poom Poom Silhouette. - [Producer] Trixie, pause for a second. - I can see your poom poom. Oh, is it out? - I don't even own panties in drag. - Why not? I don't normally wear hoochie dresses, but you're here. you ever see, like last season flipping and (beep) and - Yeah. - I cannot stand you, bitch. through the lips? To me, it's the laughing like (Jujubee and Trixie laugh) - Try it. (laughs) - In the next group, Vanjie's Cleopatra, Nina's Liberace, Plastique is Ali Wong, and Gottmik is Pal, the What do you think of Vanjie as Cleopatra? - [Jujubee] It's Vanjie. - It's Vanjie. - It's Vanjie in a Rick James wig. She is so funny, and honestly, loved how little she appeared because you do have to - She just had the outfit. She was like, &quot;I'm gonna - [Trixie] She really was Give me that wig.&quot; - She probably searched on the internet, &quot;Who hasn't been on Snatch Game yet? What character is open?&quot; - Why did she come out in a Persian rug? She looked like a taquito. And then she spun around like And I said, &quot;You really from your living room.&quot; maybe she's coming out - If Vanjie starts marketing Okay? - Bath mats, maybe. Don't you love the Squatty Potty? I don't know why I know this about you. - I do love the Squatty Potty and Tushy. - Yes. Good for you. You deserve it. with that water - Girl. - Baby. it came out my nose. - But listen, do you know It's a little wiggle. It's like a little, It doesn't just hit your hole, does it? - It's supposed to touch my butt hole? I've been drinking out of it. Up next we have Nina as - Hilarious - [Jujubee] Hilarious, comedy. But this is what we expect from Nina. - Yes. go full force, she's and she's gonna stay in this role, and this is exactly what she's doing. - I saw her in the national and she just steals every scene she's in. She's electric. - [Jujubee] That's a great person and a great performer, great actor, 'cause she's also giving - Yeah, she's also so locked in and she's getting the laughs that she's not feeling stingy. - No. &quot;I'll help you with this joke.&quot; - Yeah. I mean, when she turned &quot;Do you work at the other are you wearing the rug store or whatever. - Yeah. - &quot;What is that?&quot; - Up next we have Plastique as Ali Wong - Always Wong, never white. - This was Ali Wrong. - Say that again. I loved to see her struggle. I know that's horrible. - But I was like, &quot;Ah!&quot; - It's true. It's like, &quot;Oh Fantastic!&quot; I don't think she was terrible. - I think it was the weakest of the night. - Sure. to her because I saw myself in I was like, &quot;That's me.&quot; I knew I was Plastique, She and I are the same. - I can't even tell the difference. - Thank you. Up next we have Gottmik. It's Pal the dog. had a different name. - [Trixie] You thought dogs named Lassie? - I thought the dog's name was Lassie and they just answered to Lassie. - I loved this choice and I (beep) loved this Snatch Game. - It's hilarious. The tongue out. - Also, because we don't Gottmik was like, &quot;All - Right. and I'm just gonna go for it. - And I loved that. And it's like, Hollywood waves, big dramatic Hollywood and then a dog face. - A clean tongue. I'm like kind of rooting for Gottmik. Can I say that? - I'm rooting for Gottmik and Angeria, but I don't wanna offend anybody else that's already on there. - I don't think any of them - I really don't give a - Exactly so. - You like what you like. - [Trixie] Who's your - Do you really have to ask me who my favorite in this group was? Because it's obviously Nina. This Nina (beep) was fierce. - Nina's fantastic and I wonder if it was because there was another Liberace. - Maybe it helped Nina to be like, &quot;I gotta go for it.&quot; - &quot;And I gotta outdo Shannel,&quot; - Oh to do Shannel? Is that? - You sound (beep) Canadian. - That's what it is. Did you have a favorite You loved Nina, anybody What about the fact that - Is it? - Remember when her tagline - [Trixie] At the makeup mirrors, the Queens are discussing who Would you give it to someone or would you give it to your friend? - I would say who is I would line them up and I would say, &quot;Which one of you wants this?&quot; And then there's gonna be like two or three people who raise their hands. I would act like I was going over to them. - Yeah. to another person. - And then I would go. (laughs) - I know how petty drag - Are we petty? - Girl. I just feel like whoever I give it to, the other girls are like, &quot;Oh. Well I just thought we were sisters and you didn't give it to me.&quot; - But we are sisters. - I mean even drag queens the claws are gonna come out. - Sure, sure. - [Trixie] Are Nina and I mean they're not really but it seems like. - [Jujubee] I think Shannel but I don't think Nina thinks - If you're in an alliance, - Because you're a dumb bitch. - Do you know what's funny? I can see us sitting here in 40 years, wearing the same looks, (Trixie laughs) &quot;Oh I remember when we Like, you know.

And there's not one flyaway The purple eyeshadow and the red lips. And it's really difficult to like balance- - It is. look so beautiful and - Yeah, purple eyeshadow, red lip can look really whoreish and crazy. - This is so delicate. I like getting introduced to and when she's like, &quot;This is an important I'm like, &quot;Work.&quot; but I liked it. - It's like the evil thing. I love it. - That's she said. - And the titties are out. (door squeaking) - I don't think you I think you just wanted to touch yourself. - Oh! we have Gottmik, let me just. - [Jujubee] I think this It's smart, it's beautiful, it's art. And there's literally like zero fabric. - Yeah. It was so creative. - [Trixie] I had almost an - Do you (beep). - No, I honestly was like. - You can be honest. - The relationship with body dysmorphia and laying on the table and and taking a piece away more assembled. Right. that watching her and I was just like, &quot;This is really vulnerable.&quot; The purposely grotesque blood bag of, &quot;This is my breasts.&quot; - It's aggressive, it's punk rock. It kind of turns your This made me actually be like, &quot;Oh my God. This is a prolific artist Who had your favorite look? I mean this tough. - Plastique is my favorite look, but a close, close is Gottmik. - Yes, I'm gonna say and Plastique was my number two. - And that's. - It really was just both - They were both so gorgeous. The two fashion queens. - After judges' critiques, we find out that the top two queens of the week are, Nina West, and once again, Gottmik. Second week in a row. Do you agree with the top two? - Yeah. Nina's wasn't my fave, she could have came up and we would've been - [Producer] Trixie, pause. - [Jujubee] Are you - I love that little (beep) voice. - Yeah. You wanna fix my hair? You wanna plant some trees with me, mama? - [Trixie] So Gottmik and by guest judge Anitta, who by the way, looks - Yeah. Beautiful, bodacious, - Her eyes just look like deep chocolate. It's just beautiful. Did you notice her nose? she has a little Kerry Washington nose. - Just boop. - [Trixie] What do you - It was great. - Well, that's not how I feel. I loved the lip sync, in general, I hated all those reveals. Clunky boots. You've heard of Kinky Boots? - [Jujubee] Okay, all right, well I was talking about Gottmik. - Oh. - Yeah. This is one of my favorite performances that I've seen Gottmik do. - Girl, her whipping her hair all sexy and then cutting to her &quot;What is she doing laundry over there?&quot; - That was so funny. I believe that when one is to do a reveal, the next thing should be better. And I think the intention was to be that. But I also believe that it took away from the Because it's a lip sync for your life. - Yes. &quot;Where do I have to look for the clasp?&quot; 'Cause that's what I was noticing. - And also, they need to be fluid, and preferably, we don't see them coming. If this tore away, this outfit tore away into we'd be like, &quot;Oh my God, I had no idea.&quot; Whereas like, a sequin dot tarp? It's like, &quot;I hope that comes off.&quot; I thought Nina gave a spirited performance and maybe for a different song, these reveals would've been great. So the winner is once again - [Jujubee] Yes, I agree with this win! Congratulations, Gottmik. - And can I get my alternate - No! so before you loved alternates and now. Gottmik is the first double I mean, that must make - Yep. Benefactress Badges and to give one away next week. - I feel like she's gonna We see Plastique go, &quot;Good luck.&quot; &quot;Good luck,&quot; and I think She's doing the campaigning. - Now we see Gottmik use the Ruby Snippers and cut off Jorgeous. That kind of surprised me. - [Jujubee] Yeah, but why? - [Trixie] Well, Jorgeous - Okay. So maybe she's like, &quot;We What if next week is You kind of have to cut off- - Based on what you think - Sure. do you think could win at all? - Oh my gosh. This is a really I really think people need I really do. - From what we've seen so far. - Mm-hmm. - Because Gottmik is that - Little bitch. - There's these moments on &quot;Drag and you watch and you go, - Yeah. I go, &quot;You (beep) bitch.&quot; Like when Plastique walks &quot;You whore.&quot; - You dumb bitch. Like I get mad almost. - Do you? - Is that envy? If you see Plastique walk the runway and you don't feel some envy, I think you have too much confidence. I think you're too inflated and you need to- Some of us are just happy and we're okay with being alone. - Okay. God. - There's this thing called solitude. - You are such a (beep) freak.
