You knew he wouldn't trust me! - I know what to do. I vote skip. - Why did you do that? - You just let the Impostor win. - I've got this! - Well, we just lost. - I've got to admit, I've in my time, but voting has got to take the cake. - Come on, come on, hurry up! - You can't win by assignments. Britney hasn't done a single one, I've been watching. - Maybe. But you see here, one guy can do everyone's assignments. (triumphant music) - No, no, no!
