Hello and welcome (back) to my channel This time I will restore this.... ...Jewelers Gold Wire Roller Lately it served as a garden deco My parents saved it from this destiny And gave it to me last christmas as present So its the last present I ever received from my dad I will restore it and put it back to use First I need to get it to my workbench It was standing outside for almost a year... ...before my parents bought it I think the damage is not too big No wood at this handle This cover looks homemade Guess the jeweler added it for safety The welding is rough Let's take it apart Force is transmitted with a feather key The adjusting bolts are deadlock I need heat There we go Bronze plain bearings Some nuts are tight and some are very loose First roller can be pulled out easily What about the second one? Again very loose No wonder one of them is missing I start by cleaning the bearings I use the ultrasonic cleaner 30 minutes should be enough For the small parts I use a trowalizer They will rotate in the abrasive corundum for a day This tool is mainly used for polishing stones Lets see how it works Back to the bearings Clean, but corroded I will brass wire brush them This time I want to keep the surfaces as they were Next the rollers I hope they are not in bad shape I dont want to destroy the dimensions As both rolers need to align perfectly So less is more I think There are bits with stronger corrosion I preserve with W44T oil Rollers are done Let's see what the trowalizer has achieved Weird looks like a blued part All parts cleaned up nicely Again preserve in oil The missing washers are replaced I continue on the lathe 80-400 grits I clean the threads with a steel brush As well as the other bigger bolts I zinc plate them Since I dont polish I think zinc is the better fit And it's more endurable than nickel I plate for 45 minutes at 3-4 Amps Very satisfied Oh there is one more disassembly to do The rivet is removed with the angle grinder The handle is dented I just tap it back into shape Again from 80 grit to 400grit Who would have thought? Looks nice again Plating completed Like always I use corundum 0.2-0.5 as blasting medium The homemade part needs some extra care to fit the roller Metal filler for poor welding seams Its suitable for powder coating The cast is so rough that it is iconic again Therefore I also use no primer powder In powder coating primer mostly serves as a filler But powder coating can be done directly on bare metal I use RAL 1015 "Light Ivory" Only doing top coating brings out the rough surface best The rails are cold-blued I always say it adds a layer of &quot;noble&quot; rust or oxide To simplify chemical nerd stuff Let me know if you also like a more preserving finish Give me feedback in the comments This part is too big for my oven So its gonna be a classic paint job But first remove the old paint and rust... ...ith a cleaning disk on the angle grinder 2 coats of primer Finishing with scotch brite And 3 layers of 2k RAL 3000 "Flame Red" First 2 layers are thin And consider flash-off times between the layers Looks like new The gears are rusted I brush them off I hot blue and reharden them in one sweep Thanks to my patrons, I now have a forge for this job I quench in oil at 900 degrees Afterwards at 200 degrees for 2 hours in the oven... ...to relax the now brittle steel Everything is ready for assembly Assembly is straight forward Big Thank You to Ulli for donating new wrenches Soften the tip with heat I restored this piece because I need it for my next project So stay tuned, it's going to be exciting No testing today though You need to come back for this :) But please take a guess in the comments, what I will do next!
