So Daniel, what time is it? It's a quarter past three now, exactly. Yes, the best time, right? Midday or night? Middle of the night. Middle of the night? In the middle of the night, that's exactly how it is. Now we have to make room again and get the coffee out. And what time do you open? We open at six, right? So now we have to prepare a little bit here, make a little coffee, bake a few rolls and some minced meat. That's really all. Get ready. Then we go outside with it. Okay, it's running. I already made coffee for us. So. Cooling costume. And now let's start with the onions. Onions. How long have you been around? We've been around for two years since next month, November. Two years. Two years already. Time flies, you don't even notice it. If you're working all the time, you don't even notice, honestly. Two years already. And your name? Bobby's brake pad. And who gave him the name? You? So actually not directly. Well, I once got the nickname Bobby. And then when I had the opportunity to take over the store here, we thought, thought, thought, thought. And then a colleague came and said, you know, there are several names for meatballs. That was already the plan to make the meatballs known. And then he says, yes, and there is still the term brake block. And I didn't even know them before. Then let's first say Bobby's brake block. Great idea. And then we took it over. And then I wrote to a colleague. Like, yo, I have an idea. Can you design a logo like this for me here? I would like one of those moving meatballs. And then what I'm sitting in there. He really made me horny. So I thought it was really good. And then people came and said, some people came and said, I think the name is so cool and the logo. And looks funny. I'm glad. It was worth it. A little bit. Back then it was common, I would say, for German snack bars. They had such interesting names, I'll put it that way. Now. Just like I heard it by listening. So I don't think I was there yet. But a few older colleagues who lived in the 80s also thought so. There were many names. Here in the harbor, for example, there was something that wasn't heard of often, but which I also found cool. It was called Hot Tire. Was also a snack bar. Yes, it was quite good. Now closed now? Now, yes. Now there are very few. So the last ones, one after the other, are still closing, as I have now noticed, it continues. It doesn't stop. Let's see. Thank God we have a good location here, we're not afraid yet. The question is what the bridge looks like. Once you have made your decision here in Hamburg. With the cooling fire bridge. Yes and then? So that is, if we decide so. Until then. Hopefully you will have something firmer, something secure at the latest. We are only mobile here. But until then, it will still take a while. So until something is decided here in Hamburg. Well, acquaintances who actually work in this area now say that nothing will happen before 2024 anyway. That means I still have 20 years until then. So the Borner are the meatballs. Yes definitely. Hence the name. That's why, that's how it is. So people come here from Switzerland who came here specifically. Nice to try a meatball. They also saw it on TV. We have already been to the two northern reports. And then they saw it and said, I think that's so cool. I would really like to try this. And they were here in Hamburg and then they came over specifically. It's a good parking option. So anyone who has ever heard that. The time has now come. People say, okay, I want to try some really hot meatballs. Because we don't have them anymore. Or you won't be able to get any. Homemade, it was also good. That's where it starts. We're standing here, it's now half past three, four in the morning. And they peel onions here, cut onions here. I wouldn't have to do the work if I just bought them from the bag and put them on the grill. Or if I just added onion powder instead of onion pieces. But peeling onions, cutting onions and this and that and everything. It all takes time. But thank God you get back the time you invest. Because people also say that it tastes good. Yeah right. Taste again. This is also an awesome device. At first everything was cut by hand. Yes. Pilgrim's Hill and Bud Spencer. He's already had visitors. Someone came from France and said that she repaired me here, on the premises. And then he tells the story, he says, oh dear, Bud Spencer, I know him. How do you know him? So we speak in English. And he just says, yes, I'm actually from Italy and I'm here to work now. And once he came to the beach with his fat caravan, in the village where I lived , and lived there once. And then drove around on the beach with his quad bike. Dude, awesome. Hamburg is truly a cosmopolitan city. People come here from all over the world and then they have stories to tell. Do you think he's still kidding me? He doesn't know me yet. We have onions inside. Onto the buns. We'll share that, yes. Good. Onions. A few eggs. Oh yes. If our shift starts at 6 a.m., then we're on site at 6 a.m. and they're already driving up, no. That means they have to get ready, clean, pull, everything. Now they're all on their way. Sometimes one or the other comes and can have a coffee. You can take some rolls with you. I'm not coming back, I'm going in now, then I'll move on. Or where to? Yes, to Poland, to Bavaria, to this, to that. So really everywhere, no. Quite interesting. Sometimes you have time again when you chat with someone. If you have time, if they have time, then to tell interesting things, no. When you're on the go all day. Are they loaded here? Yes, exactly. So they loaded, unloaded, all sorts of things, no. So, they're definitely on the move here. Here the whole harbor, here along the street. Then you're with Hale too, no. Then you also have containers and stuff. That's all. And many people also take a detour, no. They then say, you, I'm here in the port of Hamburg. I actually loaded back there. I specifically took a detour on my route. I need something to eat. Then you won't get anything to eat. Now when I drive off on the motorway, I get a coffee for 5 euros or so. Then I'd rather take a little detour and get a coffee for 1.50 euros and can also get something to eat. The next secret ingredient, I say. It's not that secret either. Freshly ground pepper. This is very important. Not pre-ground, but always fresh. Because, that's obvious to most people, but many people underestimate it when you really do it, especially with so many. So when you smell it now, it's completely different, no. Yes. Okay. That was pepper and now come the rest of the spices. Mmm. So. So, I have to find my way around it, I've got it brand new now. Yes, you see, that wasn't it. It works. Well, that's not what I got for that, no. This is actually out now for self-service. But wait, I can use it straight away. So. So. If you could smell it now, you would notice that it already has... Yes. Appetite stimulating, let's put it that way. Exactly , roughly, exactly. We just cut it in roughly, the whole roll in. This only needs to be chopped briefly once. Because through the onions, through the salt, through the spices, the onions release all their juice. And this juice then softens the rolls one way or another, you know. And then exactly, that's all, because it stands for another night, as I said, it's all released. And the bread has time to pre-soak. The flavors have time to mingle. And then you finish everything at once, no. So you can see that the rolls have now been mashed into small pieces. Now the minced meat comes in. Yes. What kind of hack is this? That's ground pork, no. From the Hamburg meat wholesale market here. Many people go home on Thursday and Friday. And then you take some with you for your wife, for your children, for your boss, for your work colleagues. Because unfortunately that's just the fact that you don't get something like that very often anymore, no. Then you get something ripped open from the bag. Even if you make them yourself, there's no guarantee that they'll be good, no. That's just it. And then they say, here's my chance, I'm in Hamburg, I'll take something with me, no. I think like many who work in the industry for a long time, in the catering industry, the dream of having your own restaurant or your own snack bar or whatever, your own restaurant is not far away now, no. So it was always there, but it was never so tangible that I now said, yes, I'll do that, no. We've always thought about it, so oh, that would be really cool. I was always good at it, no. But my bosses were always happy with me. Nobody can complain about that. Nice greetings again. But yes, when the chance came, and then it was just, you, I, I was in such a situation that I had the time, no. So I wasn't in training right now. I would say it was in the transition phase. What have you learned? Uh, I haven't learned anything yet. I'm still here, I started when I was 21, no. I started when I was 21. Ah, you're 23 now. Yes, exactly, 23. I started when I was 21, I was still with the federal government before that. After the federal government, I went to study. That was during Corona. And then I stopped my studies. And then I sat there. I studied in Magdeburg. Beautiful city. I love Magdeburg. I don't know why, but I love Magdeburg. I studied in Magdeburg, but the only problem was during Corona, it was all online lessons. I was sitting there in my booth, squatting there. I didn't know anyone. At some point there will be curfews and whatever. In any case, I hadn't met anyone yet. I paid for my rent on Bafog. Used like a, like a, like a, so not good, let's put it that way. You don't have the financial means to do anything about it now. And I couldn't go to Hamburg either. Because my car had a petrol engine back then, you simply forked out 60 euros late. You can't do that if you have 600 euros, you have to pay rent, you have to pay for food, you have to pay for everything. Can't get there. Can't get there, exactly. And then I stopped after a year. That was in the middle of Corona. And what did you study? That's just typical, business administration. Dropped out of business administration for a year. I imagined it completely differently, I have to say. It's not just Corona's fault, I'm not the study type either, let me put it that way. For example, something like this here now, up to three in the morning, that's a bit stupid. But in general, I like physical work more. This can't get any better. Yes. That's enough for now. Everything, no, we just have to work with the space we have here. I would imagine everything to be a little nicer, a little better, but as I said, I already learned in the Bundeswehr and can live in this situation. We have to see how we can progress here. What's with the miracle, there are differences here. Yes, I actually was, funny story too, I wanted something completely different. At that time I wanted to join the Panzergrenis, but unfortunately they didn't let me in because they said I had to, I had planned to study or start training, and I just said, okay, I want to get through to training and then they said, no, you have to go to the Panzergrenis at least, that was the 13 months, so moderate, no. That was voluntary military service. That was at least 13 months. I say, well, then I won't be able to do it all as I had planned, with studies or training, I just wanted to decide in time, after school with the federal government. And then I said, no, that doesn't work for me. Yes, then I can offer you something with drones, they offered me, or medical services. I thought about it, thought about it, thought about it, then I said, yes, come on, do medical work. That was definitely different than other departments, no. That was a little, a little, a little easier, let me put it that way. But okay, it was still fun. There were definitely many, many good people there, no. It's also interesting, many who also wanted to become doctors, no, who said, I'm with the federal government now, I'll do my medical service here, and then I want to become a doctor. Okay, awesome. Let's see. See you again in a few years. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for you, I hope so. Nope. So, there were good guys there too. Greetings if you see this, if I see you again. Unfortunately, I lost the numbers at some point, no. The phone numbers, that's a shame. That was a great time, no. Basic training, anyone who was with the federal government can say that, because basic training was the best thing. That was really cool. It's starting. That 's the first step, and now it actually takes about half an hour to finish. Stay nice and juicy, not dried out, no. That they get nice and brown on the outside. But as I said, don't dry it out from the inside, no. Don't turn black, don't get hard, don't dry out. Perfect temperature, precisely tailored. So exactly twelve minutes, then they are turned, another twelve minutes, then they are done. What's in the meatball? 200 grams. A meatball 200 grams. They are weighed exactly so that everything is correct, no. Smells very good. I'm my own boss somewhere, but I also have a boss above me, and yes, that's the guest. The guest is my boss, if he doesn't like it, then I can't live off anything on the table. Or rather, I don't have anything on the table, let me put it that way, no. If no guests come, then I don't need to open the shop here. These are, let me put it this way, my bosses. And if they say, I don't like it, then I just have to adapt to that, no. Then I'm just dependent on my guests. It's perfect, perfect, that's how we are in the catering industry. We are there for the people, no. It's cool that you can even see such small pieces of bucket. Exactly, that's right, that's what I'm saying. Some don't like it, others love it, because you see, there's work involved. And I'll say that at 90 percent. If you do some things, like in real life, some things you just have to put in the work, otherwise it won't work. Just like with sports. If you come in there and then I go back home, it won't work. You just have to force yourself and you just have to put in the work, otherwise it won't help. It's the same here too. Basically, whether it's with the meatballs or with the business, you just have to go for it, I'll put it that way. Just do it. And it's the same with the meatballs. You don't just use onion powder or something out of the bag or whatever, you just make it fresh and you do it right. Took almost two hours. Yes, you can save yourself all that time, you know, if you just tear open a bag, put it on the grill and you're done, no. That happens often too. So finish... Yes, exactly. Complete. If only you didn't do it yourself. Except you don't do it yourself, it took two hours. Meager. So now with the ice packs they come down here. My father made this for me. So. And then they get fresh on a regular basis. As soon as they run out, we keep an eye on it and then we always make fresh ones. That's another thing, for example. This is very important with the meatballs. The difference between whether a meatball sits for an hour or seven hours is worlds apart. The best thing is when you actually come right now, the rolls are fresh out of the oven and the meatball is fresh out of the pan. That's really cool. This is going very well. Yes definitely. And that's what we're trying to reconstruct. Every time, every day, several times a day, you always have the opportunity to come and at that exact moment you have just finished a fresh load. Look, we now have twelve pieces. For today I've scheduled almost 180 or 100. That means the thing is hit a few more times and then everyone has a chance. Nice and fresh from the pan. Like back then with mom. Yes. Tastes like home. Minimum. If not better, even. The only thing we can't get to is memory. But otherwise it definitely tastes like home. Shall we try? Yes, of course. With buns, yes. Let's get together, let's take a short break. We still have a bit of time. Or with mustard, the classic way. Let's make a cardboard. Fresh. Two more rolls. Thank you very much. To you too. Bon appetit. Bon appetit. Yes very good. Delicious. Thank you very much. Because it was marinated with all the salt the day before, the onion releases its juice. All the flavor. And all the flavor is distributed throughout the minced meat. It's all in one bite. Everything already. A meatball is actually very simple. But then the art is that it tastes good. Bread, minced meat, mustard, onion, spices. And somehow every meatball is different. In buns? Yes. The best in Hamburg, meatballs. Yes definitely. Before they're all gone, right? Yes, at six. Once in a roll, right? You can use mustard straight away, right? Yes, you can use mustard. That would be three euros, please. Exactly, 1.20 does that, please. Thanks. Thanks. Thank you, I wish you too, yes. Late? Yes, good. No, hold on. As long as I have to work on the weekend, that's fine. Hopefully. Mustard and ketchup, yo. I also have mustard here, everything, here, everything. Here and there. So here we have a fresh meatball. Yes. At three euros, please. Good morning. Good morning. Take a look here. The food is already warm here. About the time. Can I conjure up something here? That's why you're in the newspaper, right? Yes. Rolling slowly, right? You already are. So, a portion to take home, please. In a bun? No, extra. So extra rolls, right? Yes. The extra part. And then what do you have now? I can still do some magic. I'm currently in the process of proving it. I'll definitely take a salami. Yes. Well, that's exactly it. I usually don't open until 6. Because I still have everything empty now, right? What time is it? It's only half past six, right? It's starting slowly, for once, right? But it's already fuller than expected, right? I have a coffee boat and salami rolls. Two Mettbrotchen? Once salami and once Mett, or just salami once? One salami and one coffee. Now I have it. So, let's get started right away, okay? Yes. They're always indignant. At 10 a.m. we take out the crane and pack up. Do you know where that is? There at the back of the ship. Up here? Yes. Yes, there was the 26th recently. Yes, 26, as far as that goes. If you drive past the pipe and where it gets wider, you're exactly free. Yes, exactly. Then we stand there and I also have another one, the 150, and then we both squeeze in there. We always drive, one standing like this and the other standing like this. What's on it for you, Gerd? A roof of blood. And we drive with the 150 and you with the 80? Yes. And you say, it'll start driving at some point, and then you have to look, and then it'll drive away. Morning! Start right away, okay? It's all ok. Do you recognize him? My colleague Popp. Yes, yes. My colleague Popp. Yes, exactly, Popp. All you can see is the demand. Yes, yes, pop, yes. From Mr. Popp. Yes, yes, pop. Yes. He also asked, do you already have bratwurst? No, I haven't yet. Now it starts. They shouldn't all just be fried. They should stay fresh. Is this the last pack? Yes, this is the last pack, but we're getting a new delivery today, thank God. Also simply that you are no longer alone. If you're alone here all day, you'll get bored at some point, right? Sure, sometimes a guest comes and then you chat for a minute or two, but the rest of the time you're alone, working, laughing, we're having fun. Good morning! Five Rigadellen rolls and half a Mett, please. Five pieces and half a Mett, gladly. We're early today. Again. Thank you. Usually not until six. There is no question of being late. Oh yeah . Hello, where are you? Yes, hello, I would order you something. Yes gladly. Six Rigadelle rolls with chatter. Yes indeed. We would come by around seven o'clock. Seven o'clock, all clear. Yes? Yeah, great. Wonderful, thank you. Thanks too. Ciao, ciao. But this is a cool cell phone here. This is a real cell phone. Actually a tablet, right? So. Two. Three. Four. Morning. Photos of me, of the six. So. So. Six times, all clear. Gust again? Yes, let's see. Sometimes the week is such that nothing is going on. And on Friday it hits. And then it's again because, again because, again because. So. So. All right. Well, we can do that right away. It's all ok. We can still get it here. We have two cheese crackers. Two cheese crackers? I don't have them on the grill right now either. They don't need a moment, right? Do you have time? Yes. In the Hamburg wholesale market? Also wholesale market, that's exactly how it is. From... Michael from Kaltenkirchen, actually. We have one too. A guest here. Yes. A guest actually came here and he said, I just opened a package. Oh well, Bleyer and Wichert. I say, yes, actually. My daughter works there. Oh what. Very funny, everything. The Harbor Kitten. What can I do for you? Can you give me two half Mett and a coffee? Two half Mett and a coffee, gladly. Then we need Mettbrotchen again, please wait. So. Anything else? No, it wasn't there yet. The one today. Smaller? It will be full, yes. Exactly, once full. The pasta salad again. Yes. I would like coffee. Then I take one with liver sausage and half with onions. Yes indeed. Thanks. And a coffee, please. Yes indeed. Two Mett at the end. Yes. We're open until 4 p.m. and there are no meatballs at 2 p.m. On a day like today, when people come and then, as I said, take a drink with them for home or for the company, on a Friday for example, it can happen that they run out quickly. First come, first served. Once a poodle. Once a poodle, yes. One with salami and one with yacht sausage. Salami and yacht sausage, yes. And coffee with it? Yes. Only at 95, please. Should I wrap it up once? Yes, please. One liver sausage and cheese. Once liver sausage, once cheese, yes. And a cocoa. Yes indeed. One cheese. Liver sausage again, please. Sun. 10.60 please. Twice? Yes. Four, yes. 5.40 please. 5.20, sorry. Thanks. Hot bun, hot meatball. Well, that's it, right? Yes, please. Two euros back. Cocoa was two euros, right? Yes, please. Thank you. Yes, if you start here at three, then definitely a shit, right? Yes, yes, not just one. Not just one. Usually three. Three big ones. One liter minimum. Are you thinking about the hotel now, right? Yes, yes, must. Let's see. For now just YouTube. No private advertising film yet, right? But these days, right? Yes, that's it. Everyone does that. What is he doing on Instagram? I think it's cool too, he's been doing such a good job lately. Have a look. There's another bag. Yes, let's see. But we also need time for that, right? Unfortunately not yet. Do you do that on the side then, right? Cutting and everything? I'll do that, right? Now this is just for his YouTube channel, right? Yes. Here also. Let's see what happens, right? All right, I wish you something. Thank you too. Bestseller. Yes, the stage. And then. There we have it. Wrap up? No, yes. Coffee? 35 please. Thank you. Let's see, you always have to adapt, right? So... Very strange films at the very beginning, I opened the shop, I was standing alone, I had red wine, white wine, spice jars with allspice and all sorts of things and juniper berries and I cooked my Bolognese here. Here with my stovetop for hours. And then, yes. And I had great peas. And Bolognese and goulash and the classics. Everything done. A lot of work put in, a lot of effort. But unfortunately it flopped. Because at the end of the day people came, saw, oh, Bolognese? Yes, no. Let's make currywurst fries. Because, how should I put it, everything is... You just have to adapt to your guests. And if, for example, you have a long-distance driver here, a truck driver, he won't take out his knife and fork and eat his Bolognese while driving , whatever. Or sip your soup here. Do you need time. But most of them just have to be quick, we're a snack bar, we have to be quick. It has to be practical. You put a meatball in your bun, get behind the wheel and take a bite with one hand. And he made it all happen. And now over time, the things that remain work. And unfortunately, unfortunately for God, the others are no longer there. But who knows, hopefully maybe a larger store, maybe a permanent location where you can do something like that. So awesome, awesome, homemade giant schnitzel fries, pea soup. Who knows, let's see. But unfortunately there is little space here. There would be demand, but without seats it would be difficult. And then you just adapt accordingly. But there is enough standing room. No problem. Good shop, definitely. One of the best fries in the area. One hour of breakfast and homemade fricasses. Mega. I can only recommend it. Can you say that or not? And solid prices. If you go somewhere else and see how much this shit costs, then it's okay here. I'm happy to be dealt with. Thank you. Good Morning. How are you? Good, you? Can I get 15 rolls? What are you getting today? 4.50. I thank you. 1, 2. New delivery? New delivery, exactly. Sort everything here. Order is the be-all and end-all. This is really important. Order is important. Because if you... The problem... We learned that back in the Bundeswehr. Also from home, but also from the Bundeswehr. A place for everything and everything in its place. That's what they taught us back then. When the alarm comes and you have to get ready, you have to think about it. Shit, where's my pants, where's my jacket, where's my vest? And you reach into the closet and you know, up here on the left is my jacket, up here on the right is my vest, down here are my pants. There are my shoes. And even if it's dark and there's a power outage, you take your things and put them on. That's exactly how it is here. That's exactly how it is. And you have to beat that into everyone who works here. A place for everything and everything in its place.
