It was a moment where glitz and Donald embodied that glitz. &gt;&gt; And that was one he really got a taste and Donald Trump is a man Outside of the spotlight, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He had succeeded. Trump Tower was a reality. He had proof he was a winner, &gt;&gt; There is an old money elite that has never accepted Donald. He was considered, I think, and too self-centered and not someone who fit in. And so I think this is where comes from. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: As Donald and Ivana on the top three floors something was missing. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have a lot but how can somebody How do you trust anyone that, What do they want out of you? It's very difficult, and he is the epitome &gt;&gt; As much as I care my relationship with my wife &gt;&gt; Sometimes people ask me what He works so hard and becomes involved and problems.

And did I know did I know he had been Yes. He's a great flirt. We'll leave it at that. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In Arkansas, &quot;bimbo eruptions.&quot; &gt;&gt; Hillary certainly knows, She doesn't know everything. She never wanted to know Hillary is the only person who can completely answer but from all of my reporting she certainly knew. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Hillary had avoided &gt;&gt; She would never do that.
