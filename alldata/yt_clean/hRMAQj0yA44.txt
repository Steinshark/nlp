(energetic blues music) - It's oh-dark-thirty and heading to a place north of here by about 2 and a half hours, where a gentleman's got that are unbelievable. He said, &quot;I bought them &quot;not 'cause they were Well they all went up in value and so now we've been invited to see buildings full of cars that he restored 20, 30, 40 years ago and now they're sitting kind of unrestoring themselves. It's a pretty sad sight so come along for the ride. So whats a Barn Find guy doing flowers? Well I like flowers, okay? Actually, we're going who's got an amazing selection of cars and he happened to tell me that today is his wife Carolee's birthday so bought Carolee some flowers. This is what you do to be a Sometimes it takes buying Remember what I told you in These are the roads that nobody wants to go down a dead end road. Well, this is where the treasures are, so this is the perfect case-in-point for going down dead end roads. Look at these, here we go. Building's full of this. Here we go, Billy and Carolee. This is the ladies love me. - Oh my, thank you, they're beautiful! - Happy birthday, Carolee. - Thank you very much. - [Tom] So Billy, what's your dad's name? - Walter &quot;Bicket&quot; Eubanks. - [Tom] Walter, okay. - Just call him Bicket. - [Tom] Nice to meet you, Bicket. And thanks for teaching Where do we start, which over here, over here? - Well, uh, probably since let's look at the-- - [Tom] Okay. the Lincoln and the Stutz? Now they're dirty, I - Good, we don't want 'em clean. - [Billy] Had a lot of fast cars and, uh, and drove fast a lot but - [Tom] Never got a ticket? - [Billy] Never had a ticket. - [Tom] Man... And this is a 1929 Stutz, overhead cam shaft vertical engine. And how long have you - [Billy] It's been several years. This is oh-40, that's a 1940. - [Tom] 1940 Lincoln Continental? - [Billy] Yeah, the 41, but the 41's were two-pieces stamped out. The 40's, the back half of - [Tom] Handmade. in the back fender to make that turn. - [ Tom] Oh man. - [Billy] When I first I says, &quot;well somebody homemade &quot;It's torn to pieces&quot;. Well, I went to the show, when Ford Motor Company trophy, they said that Lincoln handmade those fenders and I had the only Lincoln maybe four, four or And I was the only one that had the homemade fenders skirts on it. - And this was basically a handmade car? - [Billy] Yeah. - That whole back end is handmade. - Are there cars back here too? - [Billy] The cars are (energetic blues music) - [Tom] Oh, now we're getting Alright, so even though you're a Mopar guy and a Hudson guy, I mean, Do you remember any stories About who you got them from or anything? - I was working at the and this car got traded in. It got stolen one time, you Mama drove it to work one night and they, she didn't get the switch cut off right and somebody stole it. It upset me so bad that that he'd give it back or he'd either give me the understanding to handle that problem, my But that Friday night, the said he had a Corvette racer. Didn't need it, we could come get it. They had got it out in the woods and it won't hurt except Well what the people had they pulled three spark when it broke the motor mount. - [Tom] Oh, doing a burnout? - [Billy] Yeah. - So I went down and got it and drove it home on five cylinders. I didn't know why it was running bad, I was just tickled to get it back. - [Tom] Now that's an A Daytona, what's the story with that car? - If you do look back into when they started building them, they had a wide wing on the back. I don't know if you ever with a wider wing. - A wider wing, I might have one. I have got one somewhere, but anyway, there's a set of holes in You can see on the inside. Feel it where they welded them up. They put the regular wing back on but they did some testing with the wing out flush I joined the Daytona Superbird Club and not many of them This one's got all clear glass in it. No power steering, no power brakes. It was a 440 four-speed. - [Tom] So 440 four-speed, - [Billy] Yep, well It has two on it when I got it but it didn't come that way, I don't think. - [Tom] And did you drive this car much? - [Billy] I have driven - [Tom] It really had - [Billy] No. do you remember what you paid for it? - [Billy] No. - [Tom] Now here's a 440 six-pack Charger. - [Billy] It's the RT but I - [Tom] Uh huh and Boy, look at that air cleaner, whoa. So you got three two-barrels You do nice paint jobs, (energetic blues music) So what cars are interesting in here? Alright, so here we have two rare Fords. That's a Torino Talladega. - [Tom] Is that a 70 or 69? - [Tom] Now some of these had big motors. Does this have a 429? - Well they had the same motor in 'em. This is a 428. So that's a single four-barrel 428? - [Billy] Yeah. - See this was an extended nose that Ford put on a standard Torino. It's about three inches longer Holman and Moody and Ford and designed a car with to keep it down at tracks like Talladega so that the front end Okay, Mercury Cyclone, that's The Mercury was tagged - [Billy] The Mercury's a lot 700 Fords, they claimed but I think they made about 275. - [Tom] No kidding. - [Billy] Yeah. - [Billy] No, it's a 351 I think. - [Tom] What an intriguing are these two cars, wow, nice. - [Billy] That's a 57 Chevy Nomad. - [Tom] Mm hmm, 57 Chevy. Now anything usual about - [Billy] Yeah but it's just a Nomad. - [Tom] So no fuel injection - [Billy] No. - [Tom] That's a manual That's a Mark two, that In effect, Ford charged they still lost money in every car. So it's a Hudson Hornet Coupe. Oh, you have a Rolls Royce. It's a special car. Oh, here we have another Chrysler 300? Another big Hemi with two four-barrels. Boy, that's some rare stuff here. 427 Chevy Impala convertible. It's automatic console, bucket seats. I can't imagine the 58 Chrysler Imperial and so did you, did you drive this car to high school? - [Billy] I drove it to high school, yes. - [Tom] This was your So a 55 four-door. - It's got 30, 36,000 miles on it. - [Tom] No kidding. More cars, how do you like that? This is amazing that we're walking by cars that on a normal episode, we would spend a half salivating over it if we found it in Northern California or Texas. Wow, look at that 55, it's great. But here, there's so many that I feel guilty about and giving credit to these cars. Oh, nice Jaguar. Well you didn't know you'd be - No, I didn't, no I didn't. - On your birthday, no less. (chuckles) - [Tom] Now Billy's knee has taken him out of service for a little So Carolee, on her walk us through these buildings. - [Carolee] Volunteered (laughter) - So here you've got That's a big block, you can That's a factory big block 427, so we've seen two of those so far. Red convertible and this, or dark blue convertible. Have you, uh, maybe you'll find - It's very possible. We have over 100. - [Carolee] My grandchildren went around and counted them one they're not all fixed up It's been quite his life work. - [Tom] Yeah, isn't that wonderful? So this is a Z28. [Tom] So, I don't know, So this is a Chrysler, probably a 57 Chrysler [Carolee] He liked the he really liked the old got real excited about - [Tom] Now this I know To my knowledge, the Continental was not a Lincoln Continental, it was a Continental made by Lincoln. But this is a Lincoln Cosmopolitan so it's got both names on the fender. And I think this was the if I'm not mistaken. It was based on kind - [Carolee] Well when Billy he was more into the old Lincolns. He liked the old Lincolns. - [Carolee] When we first got married, he only had a car or two. And then after our daughter was born, I was in the hospital &quot;get up and look out the window.&quot; He was just really weird, I thought, &quot;he's so happy about our little girl.&quot; But he bought another car. He had it parked outside the hospital and wanted me to see it. And my life has been (raucous laughter) - [Tom] Oh man, you can't make that up. (energetic blues music) - [Carolee] This is the car he - [Tom] Oh, okay. - [Carolee] This was a We have showed a few cars, but Billy doesn't do with fixing them. He's not that much into competing. But we went to Gatlinburg, we hauled this one to Gatlinburg when my daughter, older Billy registered the car in her name 'cause he didn't want He wanted to stay out and swap car parts with all the other nuts. So Tammy and I went into the banquette. You know, they gave out and Tammy was kind of disappointed. She thought her daddy'd like a trophy. And then they got to this big one and they said, &quot;Tommy Eubanks&quot;. Well, it was Tammy Eubanks and got that trophy so fast I - Isn't that something? - She was up and back at her seat and wanting to run out and tell her daddy. - So this won Best of Show. And it was still a bargain. We're hearing all the stories here. Here we have a Studebaker. So here's the supercharger's and drives air through that the carburetor being in here. So it's a blow-through supercharger. So look at this, you have an alternator, you've got the supercharger and spring-loaded so it's got tension. You see that arm moves back and forth. Here's an alternator. It probably would've been a And then here's an air-conditioning unit. A lot going on with belts here. This was a 289 engine, Studebaker motor, not a Ford engine. So here's another Dodge Daytona. Most of these street cars were purchased. Again, we'll bring up Chrysler had to build a whether it was a Dodge or a Plymouth, to qualify the car Bill France wouldn't allow and bring it on the track. Remember, these were called stock cars. They're supposed to represent what people drove on the street. So Chrysler came out with that people could buy but they weren't necessarily modified very much. They had a 440, lots They had this wing and they had a nose, a sloopy nose on there, but they weren't really modified cars. But some people took those and this is one of those cars. These cars either came, I think some had maybe 383s. I don't know what this car had in it. Probably a 440 originally but this one now has a 426 Hemi in it. It's got really huge wheels and skinnier ones in this was a drag car at one time. Billy told us that the had brought it to a test I think in Highland Park or something, and ran it and this car That's for a street-driven It's got a four-speed pistol-grip shifter. You know, a couple of gauges were added, a, uh, oil pressure gauge, a Suntec. But the real modifications This car most likely came with a 440 but this one has a 426 Hemi on a high rise intake manifold and has a big hole cut in the hood here. So let me just put this hood down for half a second if we can. As you can see, those carburetors are gonna come right out the top. So this was a very that this car was a drag drag raced back in the day. Very modified, who knows what the horsepower's on that thing, Who knows, maybe more. We don't know if it's bored in stroke. NASCAR wouldn't allow a high You had to have the So that's why I say this a street race car, or a drag car. Here we are in rural a pretty substantial A 1970 Plymouth Superbird, same number as Richard I just want to let you I'm going through the Hagerty Price Guide and in number four condition, The average condition or one If it were excellent, it'd be $169,000 and in concours condition, $216,000. Well, what condition is this in? It hasn't started in a long time. It's dirty but I guarantee run in drive and be cleaned up to probably something of concours it's better than concours condition. It's got original paint, It's got the original interior. It's got the original drivetrain this car has a value well into according to the history (energetic blues music) Well, another Hudson Hornet. Now that's a significant car, 59 Cadillac. This is a Biarritz Eldorado. - [Caralee] I think it's - Yeah, I can't imagine what (door slams) Box is blocking the way but The weight's probably I mean this is the most obscene It was 1959 Cadillac came out with the fin and the tail lights. Just amazing piece of artwork. - [Caralee] Wanna see the Godfather? - Oh yeah, this is it right here. Huh, okay, another piece of history here. 41 Lincoln Continental. This car appeared in the Godfather movie and you can see it's got This was an actual movie car. Wow, look at this, there's a sign. &quot;Actual 45 caliber bullets &quot;special effects car from &quot;from the death scene in (bullets firing) So this is a Hollywood star of sorts. But this car here, we should look at this It's not even really a car, It's called a Ute and Made in Australia by I think it's a Plymouth So this is probably a 56, Wayfarer Chrysler, so it And I'm not sure if they were built in Australia for tax reasons. I don't know why they were built but they were still building Utes until just not too many years ago. The Airflow Chrysler, but apparently they didn't sell very well. If you look at this 35 and any they were so much more primitive. If you look at this car, The headlights are built into the body, not separate, sitting up here. And it was designed with the idea of getting better fuel economy and speed from a car that than the normal car of the day was. And it never caught on and Now this is the car So this was a, what year was it? - [Billy] 57. Tell us, Billy, this is a - [Billy] Daddy bought it new and I've traded back for it a time or two but I'm gonna keep it this time. (laughter) - [Tom] So this was a Dodge that came-- - [Billy] With a Hemi engine. - [Tom] Equipped like you stock car out of back in the It's got a Hemi engine with Did you drive this to high school, Billy? - Yeah. - No, it's a three-something, 315 maybe. - [Tom] 315 so smaller Dodges had smaller engines. - But it was still a Hemi. And it had a manual transmission? - [Billy] Yeah, pretty car, - [Tom] Boy, and you - So you told me you ordered - [Billy] Yeah and it The colors were reversed, with the two four-barrels. - [Tom] So his dad ordered - [Billy] It came wrong. - [Tom] It had two four-barrels and a Hemi but it had an automatic and So they went to another dealership and ordered one with It came with one four-barrel, - [Billy] It would fly. How fast have you had - [Billy] It didn't have the speed but it didn't seem like it wanted to run fast as that Imperial over there. - [Tom] Is that right? - [Billy] But that Imperial, But this would turn - [Tom] Is this original paint on here? - [Billy] No, that's all my work. - [Tom] And those are the - [Billy] Yeah. - [Tom] And that was a very - [Billy] Yeah but they had one and we didn't know about it, but you could get it with the 392 in it. - Wow, that's a rare car, boy. That's a beauty too. - [Billy] Let's walk out some more down there. You like junk? (energetic blues music) You know, I see a couple Olds Tornado and a Buick are now seen as classics, because they were so breathtaking, cutting edge in their front wheel drive, Front wheel drive at that point was Saabs. And Oldsmobile did it with a huge Tornado. Aha! Wow then just look inside at how nice it is. It's got 49,000 actual miles. - [Billy] 49. - [Billy] 49,000. Wow, it's beautiful, so there's a 318? Look how clean the fender That could be a nice car, boy, ooh. - I got two old Chevrolets in here. - [Tom] Oh another, two more Nomads. Oh, ha, jeez, too many toys. Okay, so this is the car This is a rare, rare car. A 1968 Corvette 427 435 horsepower, so it was the highest Okay, that's a rare Four speed, air-conditioning, side exhaust, original from the factory. It's gotta be one of the It's metallic blue with, it looks like, dark brown or maybe black interior. So this was the highest horsepower car with all the options you you know, a well heeled They wanted power but they wanted luxury. Factory Air, amazing. Have you ever seen another - [Billy] No, have you? Power steering, power side exhaust, high horsepower. - [Billy] Well it's a 400 horse. - 400 okay, so it's not 435, okay. - [Billy] No, they - Ah, okay. you could either have 435 or you could have air-conditioning. But it was different cams. Okay, got it. How you can have cars like this and never having had a speeding Alright so here's a So that's a four-speed car, 283. Is this the one you'd like to put the fuel injection on maybe? - [Billy] Maybe. Okay and here have another wing - [Billy] That's got the fast front on it So it's a real Daytona, it's That's why they had to templates on the cars I got that front end the thing was 3/4 of an - [Tom] On purpose? - Oh, alright so what Billy's telling us, this is the era when NASCAR before cars to go through tech inspection because they were being built strangely and Billy said the right side of this car is 3/4 of an inch longer and he knows that because he - [Billy] I had to do - So this nose was actually and this was on an actual NASCAR race car that Bobby Isaac drove. What motor's in this? - [Billy] It has got a red hot 440 in it. It has to, it's got so much cam, the power brakes don't work. - So that's not really a street car. There's no headlights, right? - X-X the first two numbers in the VIN indicate that it's a genuine Daytona. What year is it, 69? - [Billy] Yeah. So all Superbirds are 70s and So it's got an automatic. I wonder how many miles are on this thing. 73,206 miles. So you got this whole nose from Harry? - [Billy] Yeah. - [Billy] Except for the hood. - Okay, so I wonder what - [Billy] I think they had a - [Tom] Oh yeah, they or the sump tanks here I (energetic blues music) We have a Super Bee and let's 426 Hemi, ha ha, okay, Bring that flashlight up again. 426 Hemi head, who knows that thing, probably at least 500. This had to have been restored. I mean the paint under So this car has Super Bee on it, but it wasn't born as a Super And it was born with a now it has a Hemi, so It's got low mileage, only 47,000 miles. What's it worth, it's I don't know, I'd say in for all practical purposes, but it was just born a Coronet. Any car, and it shows me that, you know, Billy's into hot rodding he built this because he was able to find a really solid Coronet and it Alright now we're in the (laughter) So just more cars of Another Chrysler 300 58 Chevys, you know for a long time, I walked past 58 Chevys and 55 Chevys, 56 have kind of come onto their own. Oh boy, fun never stops. This is your Ford building? I got a Corvette, Corvette, Corvette. Nah, it's not all Fords. Okay, so we have three 57 Thunderbirds, which all three of them which was an option. Now this is the rare one And Billy told me it's factory two four, so This is a T-Bird with an E Also, very unusual for a manual transmission, a Oh, plus overdrive, okay, White interior, white top, red body, chrome wire wheels, big Nice, nice little package here. 54 Corvette, now if you if you don't, I'll tell you about it. 53 first year of the Corvette, Those two years, it was You couldn't get a V8 in and the reason they is because Jaguar was the And Jaguars had a six cylinder motor and they handled well and they raced well and their own version of a Jaguar, Instead of a steel body, But the problem was they used for sedans and so it didn't quite have the same lineage as Jaguar did. So it had a six cylinder with three carburetors on it because Jaguars also had This had three Rochester Also for the first two years, you couldn't get a standard transmission. It was only available in Some of these were raced, Not a lot of them and they But over the next couple years, Corvettes started to come on their own. They added a three-speed and And ultimately when you got to a Stingray, independent suspension. But this is where it they didn't end production on the Corvette because as we know, it's one of the most successful sports cars in the world. We've seen a couple of Corvettes already. This is, I think, the This one's been off the road since 1988. In 67, the highest was an L-88 427 but they're They only made a few of them. So this was the highest horsepower production car you could really get. This car's got a big block with It's got side exhaust. It's a four-speed and it's a sweet car. I mean I can't imagine how if started up, my goodness. So this is a 1980 Corvette He had to order it, It had angle port heads. It had a four-bolt main so even though it wasn't high horsepower, because back in 80, you know, cars didn't have a lot this was a pretty special car. He's still got plastic on the seats. Man, look at that. It's an automatic, let's see Whoa, is that the real mileage? Nine point two miles. Wow, man. So how's it run? You know, think about that car next to us, which is before the pollution 435 horsepower probably underrated, probably 500 horsepower okay, That 67 to 1980, 220 horsepower. I drive a Mini Cooper so it doesn't seem fair that a Corvette only had that much they were a comfortable, nice-driving car and they just didn't have a lot of horsepower at the time but it was the best car you could get And now we're coming to Pantera was build by De and it was a car that you could Ford at the time had lots Boss 429s and Boss 302s and they had just come through the Cobra era. This was one chance that Mercury had to get in the high performance The Pantera was sold through It had a 351 Cleveland motor but this was the original Pantera which not those big flairs and wings. This was a pure sports car. I wonder how many miles are on this. Probably not a lot, huh? 14,532 miles, wow. Alright, so we've seen car on top of car. I thought I'd see all the cars. I've found my favorite car It's a Jaguary XK120 Coupe and but it's dark blue and and as Billy told me, the interior's, except for this one seat What a beautiful, beautiful car. We saw an XK140 earlier, for a guy like me, better leg room, but this is the more pure design with the short roof and the long hood. So if Billy said take one home, (energetic blues music) Follow this man. Oh, we haven't seen all the buildings yet. Alright, this is gonna impressive car you've ever seen. 59 Cadillac Eldorado Factory bucket seats. I didn't know there was And tri-power. - [Billy] I can't remember what it is. - What a mammoth car, my goodness. We looked this car up on and it's unbelievable. In fair condition, which is In good condition, which is what most of them are, is $133,000. In excellent condition 180 grand and in concours condition $260,000. So we're looking at a car here that has a value greater than in the other buildings. You know what, cleaned up, I'd say this is probably a concours car so a quarter of a million We've been here for looking at what I think is unknown cars that I've And just when we thought there Billy invites us inside to see, oh there's another building here, and there's a 59 Cadillac that's, like, a piece of sculpture. Bright red, something that or Lucile Ball or somebody like that. It's been an amazing I'm glad we were able to share it with you because it's a very private collection and not too many people know about this but we were given permission respectfully and tour it. Nothing's for sale so It's just one special a series of special cars during his life. He bought them when they were cheap and kept 'em because he loved 'em, not because they were And now they are worth a lot of money. Happy hunting. (indistinct conversation) So, 59 Ford convertible, 58 A Studebaker, oh a custom A couple Eldorados.
