-Donald Trump arrived so that he could at the Manhattan after a grand jury making him the first to face criminal charges. And his allies on Fox trying to dismiss the charges while also claiming For more on this, [ Cheers and applause ] Well, by the time Trump has almost after being indicted. News networks were showing taking off from Mar-a-Lago like it was the [bleep] [ Laughter ] This is all still very surreal. I honestly never thought &quot;Donald Trump True story -- for seven years now. [ Laughter and applause ] It's so dusty, -[ Blowing ] [ Laughter, cheers, applause ] -Thank you, Wally.

Even kept the napkin [ Laughter ] So I guess the only question Definitely not. Now... I don't have to tell you, and it arrived at Last week, after everyone had basically paused its work. It was about to take The news was so shocking that when Fox News if you listen closely, inside the studio. -We have just gotten word... -...former president -Fox News was so unprepared their studio basically turned [ Laughter ] [ Gasps ] and he has an evil twin! Ay, dios mio. [ Laughter ] [ Dramatic music plays ] [ Gasps ] [ Cheers and applause ] Now, of course, Donald Trump because he is the evil twin. He would have a twin who, and then... ...delivers meals &quot;We love the shut-ins, Many people say, and I say, They're shut-in.&quot; But they'll never be shut out if we keep them And, look, I'm not saying It was. I walked off after we taped our show, and thought it was from my friend Andy Samberg. [ Laughter ] [ Laughter ] And not only was but the details about the possible charges -Breaking news, Former president Donald J. Trump has been indicted investigating hush-money Stormy Daniels. It is the first time that a current is facing criminal charges. Learning from your reporting of falsification Do you understand or possibly more -- or is that, as you understand, -I believe that that is the Now, they could add as other information comes up But let's go on the premise is a pretty complete -34 counts. That's insane. Although knowing Trump, of falsifying over and over. the $130K to Michael Cohen &quot;A legal retainer. It was for Scratch that. Better still...&quot; &quot;...it was a down payment Hang on. That's the one.&quot; 34 counts. I mean, if you throw he's dealing with, and the classified documents by the time we get Trump could be facing like which would be very funny. We spent all this time and ended up getting It's like when you turn then you realize and you take your foot off and you just get blasted [ Laughter ] And, apparently, in its surprise at the news. Even Trump himself In fact, he was apparently he didn't have a social-media as evidenced by the fact about the news had a typo in what I would call -Moments after the indictment, Trump went on a rant and I quote here, had indicated the 45th president Yes, he meant indicted. -Or he meant indicated because He thinks they just asked &quot;Can you indicate if you think and they all do this. [ Laughter ] Also, how did he not have ready to go This would be like not having an obituary ready &quot;She's dead! Uh...&quot; &quot;Uh, somebody google Oh!&quot; &quot;Who were her parents?!&quot; [ Laughter ] &quot;Is her first name 'Queen'?&quot; [ Laughter ] And yet, as shocked his allies in the GOP, and in particular his two seem especially taken aback. They took to right-wing media raging against the indictments like they were all about while also insisting were trying to destroy America and the Trump to commit whatever crimes -They're trying They're trying to take cases and resurrect them. This is literally legal voodoo. -Let's be clear, folks. This is... This is stuff that would make it would make them blush. -They see the weaponization and of the justice system. We've seen it with the FBI. We've seen it At some point, -&quot;At some point&quot;? The guy's entire life It's like -- It's like Trump Never Ending Pasta Pass [ Laughter ] He was accused and violating 50 years ago. in serial tax fraud he inherited from his father. He bragged about he colluded tried to extort to help him cheat and he stared [ Laughter ] And got away with it! people tell you not to stare This dude does it, he's fine. Just fine. Walking around, [ Laughter ] Also, is it just me been watching &quot;Succession&quot;? Because he has major [ Laughter ] &quot;I want this party to be like communist type [bleep]. Let's get, like, and maybe some [bleep] ketamine [ Laughter ] &quot;Blow [bleep] lines [ Laughter ] Although Lindsey Graham is really my personal given that he once After the coup, Now Lindsey has flip-flopped he's calling the charges voodoo about how many counts -If you've got a pile of crap it's still a pile of crap. It's &quot;duplishus&quot; charging. -He's so enraged, he can't He sounds like he's in where they bring everyone back &quot;Irene is trying She's being so duplishus.&quot; Lindsay hasn't been this mad made him go out back [As Graham] &quot;I don't care If you chop up a pile of crap it's still a pile of crap! I'm not cleaning up until you promise these chickens Chickens ain't It's unnatural!&quot; [ Laughter ] It's just Monday. It's just a monday, and Also, let's make something None of us, not me, have seen We likely won't get that So we don't know But that hasn't stopped Trump's In yet another Fox appearance, where he claimed he was and that everyone around him -I was on a plane. when this whole People were coming up to me, -Were they passengers or air marshals &quot;I was on a plane. I tried to get in the cockpit so I could get it to Mar-a-Lago And then the people They were hugging me these wonderful Although, that was not Eric Trump said on Fox. He also tried to insist was targeting his father although his story about the -This is a city -- I've spent that is falling apart. I went into literally CVS and you can't buy Tylenol because it's locked because there's so much theft I went into Duane Reade and literally you can't buy without having somebody you know, those little because there's so much looting -Usually when people go to their name is Jesse Pinkman. &quot;Bad news, Mr. White! Is it Tylenol at CVS Just pick a fake story &quot;I went to CVS to buy Tylenol. Then I went to Duane Reade Then I went to Rite Aid And then I went to a Sunoco And then I combined them all so I could stay up for 72 hours That's why I sound like this! Everybody in every one of But I also want that indicting is somehow communism another ridiculous have been regurgitating In fact, has been framing this story as an unprecedented test CNN said, &quot;There is nothing that approaches the tumult of and conviction Okay, first of all, It's this one. how a former president and unprecedented act that the guy was crazy Until now, we mostly elected And then for some reason, and went for brain-damaged You don't get to be surprised You know what I mean? It's not like some was weighing Abraham Lincoln for paying off Breezy Candles. And, yes, it may be true that indicting is a first but it's not a first In fact, it's the opposite. Healthy democracies should be accountable And it's happened in other functioning democracies Two former French presidents, and two former presidents have all been convicted on charges to bribery to embezzlement, politicians get indicted routinely. Let me offer as evidence where, by law, you're not until they pre-fit you &quot;We're not saying We're just saying 12 United States senators have Nixon's vice president And even in just one state, four of the last ten governors including Rod Blagojevich, was on Donald Trump's despite the fact could not say his last name.

He will still be fingerprinted. And he will go before this judge and be asked to enter a plea -We understand he will get fingerprinted. Whether he'll be that remains an open question. -I wouldn't put cuffs on him because he would definitely I'm pretty sure that's what he's whenever they play &quot;YMCA.&quot; I mean, here we've been and he's just gonna be But it'll be especially how Trump handles his mugshot. seem to think the mugshot And this just gives you they are to look Fox pundits claiming that Trump's mugshot -This is a horrible night but politically a great night in that -- It just is. [ Applause ] Because -- No, no. Because they're gonna -- You remember the mugshots and Johnny Cash and Jimi Hendrix turned them into even If there's a mugshot it'll be in dorm rooms and -Only thing -- a kick-ass musician. Being a kick-ass musician Other jobs, less so. I also think but if my dentist had one I wouldn't like that. And just a word of warning If you put a poster of congratulations on Not -- Not because but because nothing than seeing Donald Trump's while you're trying to get down with someone you met I mean, imagine sneaking dorm room at 3:00 a.m. and then they flick You'd be like, &quot;Oh!
