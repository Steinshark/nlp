hello everyone welcome back in the last lecture we had seen what is variable length subnet masking in today's lecture we will see solved problem number one in vlsm that is variable length subnet masking let's dive into the question directly here is the question subnet 192.168.10.0 24 to address the network which is given in the question which is given in the scenario by using the most efficient addressing possible so we are not going to do subnetting based on the flsm approach which is fixed link subnet masking approach rather we are going to do with vlsm approach it means the subnetting what we are going to do is going to be for 60 users and the subnet mask will be a different subnet mask here and whereas the subnet mask what we are going to create or generate here is going to be a different subnet mask when we compare it with here we will see how to solve this problem in this lecture before going into the solution part here is my question how many networks are here in the scenario pause this video for a while and please find out how many networks are here in the scenario i hope you are done if your answer is three you are wrong in the scenario we have six networks here is network number one which connects 60 users here is network number 2 which connects 20 users and here is network number 3 which connects 20 users plus here is another network and you see here is another network which needs two ip addresses one ip address to this interface and another ip address to this interface if these two routers wants to communicate with each other through this link then these two ip addresses should be belonging to the same network so this is network number four and this is network number five that is one ip address to this interface and another ip address to this interface and this is network number six which needs two ip addresses one is for this interface and another one for this interface so a total of six networks are here when we say 60 users or 20 users obviously it means 60 ip addresses or 20 ip addresses or 60 hosts or 20 hosts let's solve this problem by knowing the key idea behind this the key idea is always start with the largest subnet we know in this scenario this is the largest subnet this network needs only 20 ip addresses and this is also going to take only 20 ap addresses or 20 users whereas these three links are going to take two ip addresses each so when we compare all the networks this is the biggest network so we are going to start the subnetting with the largest network that is this network in this example the largest network is 60 always remember we are going to start with the largest subnet first so we know how to solve the subnetting problem the same methodology we are going to follow for vlsm also but with small changes i will tell you where that change has to be considered and we know basically is updating involves five step and we are now in step number one step number one is identify the class of the ip address and note the default subnet mask we know in the question it is given as 192.168.10.0 so obviously it is class c and the default subnet mask is 255.255.2555.0 we are done with step number one we will now move on to step number two in step number two we are required to convert the default subnet mask into binary when we convert that default subnet mask into binary we get all once in the first three octaves and zero in the last octet which is the fourth octet because the default subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 we are done with step number two also let's now move on to step number three in step number three we are required to note the number of hosts required per subnet and find the subnet generator and octet position and step number three is a very important step as far as realism is concerned because our requirement is going to change for every network we are going to address in one network it's 60 in another network it's 20 in another network it's two only right so we are going to focus more on step number three as i had already mentioned the key idea which is starting with the largest subnet first so we are going to start with the largest subnet so how many hosts per subnet we require now we are going to address the 60 users network obviously the number of hosts is going to be 60 and when we convert that 60 into binary we get 1 1 1 1 double zero and this is the binary equivalent for the number 60 so if we keenly analyze we can't get the decimal number 60 without six bits in binary so minimum bits we require for the number 60 in decimal is 6 bits in binary and how to find the subnet generator it's very simple we are going to reserve six zeros from the right right so we are going to reserve six zeros from the right so obviously six zeros means when we move from the right it's going to take the fourth octet so we had reserved six zeros and the remaining places should be filled up with once so i have filled once also then what is this subnet generator which is the first one we are encountering when we move from the right to the left this is this one right and what is the decimal position of this one 1 2 4 8 16 32 64. so the subnet generator is going to be 64 and where is this subnet generator this subnet generator is in the octet position 4 because the subnet generator is in the fourth octet now we are done with step number 3 also now we will generate the new subnet mask for the largest network which is the 60 users network in this example so let's generate the new subnet mask and the new subnet mask is going to be 255.255.255. 128 plus 64 which is 192. please note here the new subnet mask is 255.255.255.192 or in slash notation it's 8 plus 8 plus 8 plus 2 which is slash 26. please note this is only for the biggest network which is the network having 60 users in this example and we are done with step number four also and we will now move on to step number five using the subnet generator we will generate the network ranges and these network ranges are the subnet which will be reflecting in the appropriate octet position we will generate the subnets now so we know the starting ip address which is given in the question is 192.168.10.0 and in which octet we are going to add the subnet generator it is in the fourth octet right so just add 64 to the fourth octet we will be getting 192.168.10.64 so the second subnet starts with 10.64 the previous subnet obviously ends with 10.63 yes the previous subnet ends with 192.168.10.63 and make a note of this the subnet mask for the first subnet is slash 26. this first subnet is for the network which is having 60 users right so we are going to hand over the set of ip addresses to the 60 users network and coming to the second subnet in the scenario we know the second subnet is going to take 20 users right let's focus on the 20 users network now because in the scenario we have 20 user submit so in order to solve this just see we are going to focus on step number three so our intention in step number three is we are going to subnet for 20 users right so when we convert this number 20 we will be getting 1 0 1 0 0 so we can't get the decimal number 20 without 5 bits in binary so the minimum number of required bits is 5 for the requirement 20. so 5 means we are going to reserve 5 zeros right so we have reserved 5 zeros and all ones in the remaining places and what about the subnet generator the first one we encounter when we move from right to left the first one is this so the position is 1 2 4 8 16 32 so the subnet generator is 32 and this subnet generator is in 4th octet so we are going to add this 32 to the fourth octet when we add this 32 to the fourth octet of the second subnet starting address we will be getting 192.168.10.96 when the third subnet starts with 96 the previous subnet will be ending with 95 and what about the new subnet mask for this second sub network the new subnet mask is going to be 255.255.255.224 in other words it's slash 27. y224 it's 192 plus 64 plus 32. in other words we have 27 ones right 27 consecutive ones and we are going to hand over this second subnet range to the 20 users network and coming to the third subnetwork range we are not going to modify anything here because our requirement is still 20 only right we know the third subnet starts with 96 and it ends with just add 32 to this this subnet generator to this will be getting 128 so the next subnet that is the fourth subnet starts with 128 and the previous subnet ends with 127 and this is also slash 27 and we are going to hand over this to another 20 users network so we have addressed the 60 users network the 20 users network and another 20 users network we are left with three two users network right the links now how to do that now the requirement is just two right we need only two ip addresses so when we have the number two in decimal and the binary equivalent is one zero we can't get the decimal number to without two bits in binary right so two is the key number here we are going to reserve two zeros from the right so i have reserved two zeros and the remaining places are filled up with one and what is the subnet generator the first one we encounter when we move from right to left this is the first one we are encountering so what is the decimal position of this one one two four so four is the subnet generator and the octet position is also four so we are going to add four to the fourth octet so just add 4 to the fourth octet of the next subnet we have 128 right so 128 plus 4 is 132 so the previous subnet will be ending with 131 then 132 plus 4 is 136 so the previous subnet will be ending with 135 136 plus 4 is 140 the previous subnet will be ending with 139 and if you observe here the new subnet mask for the next three networks or the next three subnets will be slash 30. why we have 30 consecutive ones in other words the new subnet mask is 255.255.255 all once means 255 255 minus 1 minus 2 right so it's 2 phi 2. so the new subnet mask is 255.255.255.252 for these three networks that's why we are using slash 30 for these three networks and we are going to hand over these ip addresses to the crossover link anyway we will see the scenario again in the scenario the first set of ip addresses which is from 10.0 to 10.63 we are going to hand over this to 60 users network which is this network the second range that is from 10.64 to 10.95 27 will be given to either this or this and the third range is from 10.96 to 10.127 27 can be given to either this or this and the fourth one fifth one and six to one can be given to 10.128 to 10.131 30 can be given to this 10.132 to 10.135 30 can be given to this network and finally 10.136 to 10.139 30 can be given to this network and this is how we need to solve this vlsm subnetting problem always remember start with the largest subnet so that we can sparingly use the ip addresses and we can use the most efficient methodology for addressing the networking scenario problem and that's it guys i hope you guys enjoyed today's lecture and thank you for watching [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
