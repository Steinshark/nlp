Greetings! I would like to present a prototype of a powerful mini heat pump made from readily available materials. It can efficiently operate in both cooling and heating modes, following the same principle as an air conditioner. This is an old filter-dryer from a refrigerator. The bottom was initially cut off, and all the contents were emptied out. Using an abrasive sponge, we achieve a neat appearance. We will need a copper tube with a diameter of 9 mm (3/8 inch) and a working pressure of 44 bar. Professionals who install air conditioners, heat pumps, and other cooling systems that require long piping with separate units often use this type of tube. Therefore, it can be easily purchased at specialized stores that deal with the repair, maintenance, or installation of air conditioning systems. Mark three equal sections of 5 cm each, and then cut the pipe using a small pipe cutter. Did you know that the first heat pump was invented in 1852 by Scottish engineer William Thomson? His device, which utilized condensation and evaporation processes, laid the foundation for modern heat pumps used for both heating and cooling. We will need two 90deg copper pipe elbows, as well as many different components that I ordered from the JLCMC website. The JLC Mechatronic Components Marketplace is a true paradise for technology and automation enthusiasts! Here, you will find everything you need to work with mechanical and electronic components: linear parts, transmission systems, aluminum profiles, controllers, motors, and sensors. JLCMC aims to simplify the procurement process for manufacturers so they can save both time and money. If you are looking for quality solutions for automation, this site will surely delight you! For today's project, I have chosen 6 mm high-pressure hoses in four different colors, as well as a variety of tees, adapters, and valves. And, of course, I couldn't overlook the gel vibration-dampening feet. Since vibrations occur when the air conditioner operates, these feet will absorb them perfectly. By the way, right now, with your first registration, you can receive a $19 coupon, so don't miss your chance! Click the link in the description below the video and place your first order to receive a nice bonus and quality products like the ones I will demonstrate to you now. The high-pressure hoses in four different colors are very high-quality and rigid -- exactly what we need! Economical vacuum fitting with external thread and press-fit L-fitting Impact-absorbing gel briquette components, internal and external. Standard Speed Control Valve Model S with Push-lock fitting. An economical vacuum joint with external thread and compression L-type fitting. I modified it to create something similar to a reverse valve, allowing for refrigerant charging. I am very satisfied with the products I received. On such a positive note, I will gladly and eagerly continue the implementation of the project. Don't forget about the coupon -- the link will be in the description below the video! We are manufacturing the evaporator, which will be the one to cool down. On the side of the refrigerator dryer, we drill two holes with a diameter of 9.5 millimeters. To create a perfectly round hole, it is better to use a step drill bit. Cut about 5-10 cm from the orange high-pressure hose and connect it with the fittings. Note - that when inserting tubes into the dryer, or what is commonly referred to as a refrigerator filter, the copper tubes must press against the wall, slightly hindering the free circulation of the refrigerant. This swirling creates rapid pressure fluctuations, which increases the efficiency by 10-15%. Tightly pack the coupling. This is a high-performance fan model R.E.V. 3 H.V. in a metal housing, to which we attach gel vibration-dampening feet. Measure the diameter of the top part of the housing, then find any round object that is 1-2 cm smaller so that the copper tube can be wrapped around it. We are currently manufacturing a condenser for the heat pump. The heat pump condenser is an essential component responsible for converting the refrigerant from a gaseous state to a liquid state. It releases heat into the heating system after compressing the refrigerant, allowing for the efficient use of heat from the environment. This process is crucial for the operation of the heat pump, ensuring its efficiency and performance. Let's move on to the manufacturing of the capillary tube. Don't know what it is? Let me explain! The capillary tube in a heat pump is a narrow channel that regulates the flow of refrigerant and reduces its pressure before it enters the evaporator. It ensures the necessary amount of refrigerant, allowing it to evaporate effectively and absorb heat from the environment. This component plays a crucial role in optimizing the system's operation, contributing to its efficiency and reliability. What a beauty! To equalize the diameters of the two tubes -- 5 mm and 1.5 mm -- I will wrap a bit of thin copper wire around the capillary tube to make soldering easier and to prevent the solder from leaking out. Let's start with the preparation. First, we apply soldering flux to our tubes to promote a slight oxidation, making it easier to solder the tubes together. The first soldering iron was invented in 1820 by Scottish engineer James D. Brown. This device used electric current to heat the tip, allowing for the joining of metal parts with solder. Since then, soldering irons have undergone numerous changes and improvements, becoming indispensable tools in electronics and repair work. We are attaching the valve. By the way, it's a nice feature that the product already comes with a sealing tape similar to Teflon tape, so there's no need to apply anything extra to the threads. At the same time, it maintains a tight seal under high pressure. This is a high-performance metal compressor. It withstands high pressure while delivering good efficiency with minimal losses. It also features a built-in safety switch that automatically turns off the unit if there is a blockage or clogging in the filter or tubes. It's an excellent product, and I will leave a link if this video reaches 100,000 likes. We connect the capillary tube to the compressor using the flexible connection we made earlier. We also install a tee fitting; I have capped one end. If we connect an additional tube and make a few modifications, this setup will work for heating. If you're interested in the heating connection option, please let me know in the comments. We cut a piece of the blue high-pressure tube and connect it to the compressor and condenser. We cut the clear tube and connect it to the valve that I modified in advance to allow for charging the air conditioner. We solder the connector to the fan and the compressor. The process of properly charging an air conditioner is quite lengthy, requiring a special formula and step-by-step pumping. Therefore, you need to charge the system correctly and release the air step by step, closing the valves in sequence. If you're interested in learning how to properly charge a homemade heat pump, please let me know in the comments so I know you're interested. The heat pump operates through a cycle of thermodynamic processes, allowing it to extract heat from the surrounding environment, whether it be air, water, or soil. Initially, the refrigerant in liquid form passes through the evaporator, where it absorbs heat and turns into gas. The gas then enters the compressor, which increases its pressure and temperature. The heated refrigerant enters the condenser, where it releases heat to the heating system, condensing back into a liquid. After that, the refrigerant passes through an expansion valve, reducing its pressure, and the cycle starts anew. This makes heat pumps an efficient and environmentally friendly solution for heating and cooling. After closing the valve, the evaporator starts to heat up and stops cooling. As soon as I open the valve, it begins to freeze again. By the way, what is the temperature like outside and inside your house right now? And also add the degrees in Fahrenheit. I have 24degC (75degF) in my house and 20degC (68degF) outside. And how many degrees do you have? If you have any questions, please feel free to leave them in the comments. Thank you for watching!
