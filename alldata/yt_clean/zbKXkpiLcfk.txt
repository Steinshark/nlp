FROM OUR ARCHIVES... THE BILLY GRAHAM CLASSICS. AND NOW TONIGHT, THAT PASSAGE THAT RALPH BELL HE TALKED ABOUT THE COMFORTER, AND THAT COMES FROM AND I'M NOT A GREEK SCHOLAR, I'M NOT TRYING TO SHOW OFF BUT IT MEANS &quot;ADVOCATE&quot; THAT WORD COMFORTER. AND THAT IS WHAT THE LORD JUST BEFORE HE WAS TO DIE AND ASCEND INTO HEAVEN, THAT HE WAS GOING TO SEND SOMEONE TO HELP ALONGSIDE. NOW THE APOSTLE PAUL WROTE &quot;NOW CONCERNING MATTERS &quot;I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU IGNORANT.&quot; NOW WE'VE ALL BEEN AWARE WE'VE HAD A MOVEMENT IT HASN'T BEEN LIMITED IT'S BEEN IN ALL DENOMINATIONS, WHETHER IT'S EPISCOPAL FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE THE POPE COMES FROM, WE HELD A CRUSADE DOWN THERE AND THERE WAS A GREAT IN SOUTHERN POLAND, AND ACROSS THE BORDER WE SENSED THAT GOD WAS IN A NEW WAY. NOW SOME PEOPLE AND SOME INTERPRET IT AND SOME PEOPLE MEAN THAT OR REVIVAL IN OUR CHURCHES AND THEY CALL THAT AND OTHERS MAY HAVE CERTAIN EVIDENCES OF AND SO FORTH. I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO GET INTO BECAUSE I WOULD BE AND I'D BE HERE ALL WEEK, BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME BUT I THINK YOU KNOW BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE CHRISTIAN LIVING, WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. TIMOTHY LEARY, WAS ON A NETWORK PROGRAM AND HE SAID THAT HE BELIEVED AS A ROUTE TO TUNE INTO GOD WELL, THE ROUTE IS THE SCRIPTURE TEACHES HE'S NOT AN AGENT OR INFLUENCE, AND WE'RE NEVER TO REFER NOW THERE'S SOME IN THE AUTHORIZED VERSION BECAUSE IN THOSE DAYS SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS AGO, THEY REFERRED TO CERTAIN THINGS BECAUSE IT WAS A NEUTER, BUT HE IS NOT &quot;SOMETHING,&quot; AND HOLY INDICATES HOLY SPIRIT. NOW, SOME PLACES IT'S TRANSLATED &quot;GHOST.&quot; AS IT WAS IN THOSE DAYS, THE WORD SPIRIT BUT IT DIDN'T MEAN GHOST IN THE SENSE THAT WE MEAN SOME FILM OUT OF HOLLYWOOD THE SPIRIT IS USED TO THAT WHICH IS FLESH NOW THE BIBLE TEACHES IS CO-EQUAL WITH GOD THE FATHER THERE IS A TRINITY: GOD THE FATHER, GOD THE SON, AND NO ONE CAN EXPLAIN. IT'S LIKE THE LITTLE BOY THAT-, THAT WAS IN HER CLASSROOM, AND SHE WAS ABOUT AND THEY ASKED HOW MANY OF YOU AND ONE LITTLE GIRL AND THE TEACHER SAID, &quot;WELL, WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?&quot; AND THE LITTLE GIRL BIT HER LIP AND SHE SAID, AND THE TEACHER SAID, &quot;BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE [laughter] NOW THE BIBLE TEACHES THAT THE WORD OMNIPOTENT MEANS IN MICAH 3:8 IT SAYS &quot;I'M FULL OF POWER AND THEN THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT IS PRESENT EVERYWHERE AT THE SAME TIME. &quot;WHITHER SHALL I GO &quot;FROM THY SPIRIT, &quot;OR WHITHER SHALL I FLEE &quot;FROM THY PRESENCE,&quot; SAID THE PSALMIST IN 139:7. YOU CAN'T GO ANYWHERE AND GET AWAY FROM THE HOLY SPIRIT. THE HOLY SPIRIT IS EVERYWHERE. AND THAT'S THE REASON WHEN YOU HAVE A SENSE OF GUILT PUT THERE BY THE HOLY SPIRIT MANY TIMES, THAT GUILT WILL GO WITH YOU EVEN IF YOU TRAVEL TO A FARAWAY ISLAND TRYING TO GET RID OF IT. THE HOLY SPIRIT CONVICTING YOU THE HOLY SPIRIT BEARS WITNESS WHO IS THE TRUTH. ONE YOUNG MAN REMARKED, WHO HAD BEEN CONVERTED TO &quot;TO INDUCE SPIRITUALITY &quot;IS LIKE TRYING TO TURN ON AND MANY PEOPLE DO THAT. I FOUND OUT THAT [laughter] SO THAT'S NOT A VERY GOOD [laughter] BUT THERE ARE THOSE THAT THINK OR SOME TRANCE THAT THEY CAN HAVE THIS SAME WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT YOU CANNOT! OH, YES, THERE'S MEDITATION THAT CAN GIVE YOU A HIGH, BUT THE REAL, PERMANENT HIGH AND HE GIVES YOU A HIGH SOME OF YOU THAT ARE HAVE BEEN CONVICTED AND YOU NEED CHRIST. HE'S TRYING TO DRAW YOU WHERE THAT SIN AND THERE'S A TELEPHONE NUMBER THAT YOU CAN CALL AND A COUNSELOR'S STANDING BY AND TO HELP YOU TO MAKE THAT OR TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOU MAY HAVE IN YOUR LIFE. NOW THE HOLY SPIRIT BUT HE GIVES NEW LIFE. THE BIBLE SAYS THAT DO YOU REALIZE THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE DEAD TOWARD GOD? YOU'RE SPIRITUALLY DEAD, YOUR SPIRIT IS DEAD, YOUR BODY IS ALIVE, THE REAL YOU IS DEAD. NOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE HE NEEDS TO BE MADE ALIVE, AND THAT'S THE WORK TO MAKE YOU ALIVE. JESUS SAID AND THAT WORD ACTUALLY MEANS BORN FROM ABOVE, YOU SEE, MAN WITHOUT GOD AND LIFE IS AT BEST A BORE. &quot;EXCEPT A MAN BE BORN AGAIN &quot;HE CANNOT SEE HAVE YOU BEEN BORN AGAIN? HAS THAT HAPPENED TO YOU? WE'VE GOT THAT EXPRESSION BORN AGAIN, AND PEOPLE ARE GETTING BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SAYING, OR &quot;HE'S A BORN AGAIN I'M NOT SO SURE BUT WHAT IT THAT REALLY DOESN'T MEAN ABOUT BEING BORN AGAIN. AND BACK WHEN MR. CARTER AND RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, THEY CALLED HIM AND HE CERTAINLY WAS BUT THEN THEY BEGAN TO USE DESCRIBING AUTOMOBILES. AND THEY HAD AN AD &quot;THIS IS A BORN AGAIN AND THEN THEY SAID AND THAT WAS BORN AGAIN UNTIL IT BECAME A PHRASE THAT IT MEANS BORN FROM ABOVE, AND JESUS SAID IT A PERSON WHO'S MORE RELIGIOUS NICODEMUS, AND HE SAID, &quot;YOU NEED TO BE &quot;AND I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT &quot;AND CAUSE YOU TO WALK &quot;AND YOU SHALL KEEP GOD SAYS THROUGH EZEKIEL. &quot;HE DWELLETH WITH YOU JESUS SAID &quot;KNOW YE NOT THAT &quot;AND THAT THE SPIRIT OF GOD THE HOLY SPIRIT COMES TO AND WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL TO HELP YOU LIVE IN YOU AND THROUGH YOU. HE ALSO EMPOWERS US &quot;BUT YE SHALL RECEIVE POWER &quot;AFTER THAT THE HOLY GHOST &quot;AND YE SHALL BE WITNESSES POWER, SUPERNATURAL POWER. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, I SAY IT WITH ALL HUMILITY, I BELIEVE THAT MY PREACHING, AND I'M NOT A GREAT PREACHER, BY PREACHING STANDARDS. IF YOU TOOK A GROUP AND THEY STUDIED MY PREACHING, THEY WOULDN'T PUT ME BUT I BELIEVE THAT GOD HAS AND THERE'S THE POWER WHEN YOU LIFT UP JESUS CHRIST, THERE'S A POWER THERE. THERE'S A POWER IN THE CROSS. THERE'S A BUILT IN POWER THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. AND THEN HE PRODUCES WHEN YOU RECEIVE JESUS CHRIST, YOU WANT TO BE A PERSON AND LONG-SUFFERING AND FAITH AND MEEKNESS THAT'S PRODUCED BY THOSE ARE ATTRIBUTES LOVE, JOY, LONG-SUFFERING, GENTLENESS, GOODNESS, AND SELF-CONTROL, YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL, BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE YOU CANNOT NOT, OF YOURSELF, YOU'LL BE A TOTAL FLOP IT HAS TO BE THE HOLY SPIRIT AND PRODUCING IT IN YOU, YOU SEE, IF YOU TAKE UP ROMANS , THAT'S A CHAPTER OF DEFEAT. BUT THEN YOU PICK UP AND YOU'LL FIND THE HOLY SPIRIT AND IT'S A CHAPTER YOU CAN HAVE VICTORY WE'RE TOLD TO WALK BUT THE BIBLE ALSO TEACHES THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT AND I FOUND THAT TRUE THAT HE OPENS SOME DOORS, AND ONE OF THE GREATEST TASKS IS DECIDING WHERE TO GO, WHICH CITY TO GO TO NEXT BECAUSE WE HAVE INVITATIONS FROM AND WHERE SHOULD WE GO NEXT? WHERE SHOULD WE PUT AND THEN AS WE SEE AND WE SEE NEW CHANNELS AND WE SEE NEW MEDIUMS WE ASK OURSELVES EFFECTIVELY FOR SPREADING AND THIS IS WHERE TO HELP US AND TO LEAD US AND WE CONSTANTLY ARE AND ON OUR KNEES ABOUT IT. &quot;FOR THE HOLY SPIRIT &quot;IN THE SAME HOUR HE COMES TO TEACH US AND TO OPEN AND AND THEN HE MAGNIFIES THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. HE SHALL NOT SPEAK OF HIMSELF. IF YOU FIND A PERSON &quot;THE HOLY SPIRIT, &quot;THE HOLY SPIRIT, &quot;THE HOLY SPIRIT,&quot; NEVER TALKING ABOUT YOU CAN KNOW THAT THAT MAN FROM THE HOLY SPIRIT. THE HOLY SPIRIT EXALTS CHRIST! HE EXALTS HE DID NOT COME AND THEN HE FILLS US. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, &quot;BE NOT DRUNK WITH WINE, AND THAT MEANS FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT. YOU HAVE TO BE EMPTIED AND YOUR OWN DESIRES SO YOU CAN BE FILLED AND THAT'S A COMMAND! BE FILLED WITH ARE YOU FILLED WITH YOU CAN BE, BY FAITH, YOU CAN SAY, &quot;ALL THE, &quot;HAS BEEN FORGIVEN, &quot;BY FAITH I BELIEVE I'M FILLED BUT ALSO YOU CAN SIN AND THE WORST OF THE SINS AGAINST YOU CAN AS I PICK UP THE BIBLE, I DO DISCOVER THE WRATH THE TRANSLATION AS WE READ IN PSALM AND GRIEVED HIM IN THE DESERT, THE TRANSLATION IS &quot;THEY DISOBEYED AND MADE ANGRY THEY REBELLED AND ANGERED THEREFORE HE TURNED AND HIMSELF WOULDN'T IT BE TERRIBLE AS YOUR ENEMY BECAUSE THE WORD &quot;GRIEVE&quot; MEANS TO AND I WOULD URGE EVERY ONE LEST YOU ROUSE THE WRATH &quot;MY SPIRIT SHALL NOT ALWAYS GOD SAID WAY BACK IN IN THE DAYS OF NOAH. AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND THE FLOOD CAME EXCEPT FOR EIGHT PEOPLE. THE HOLY SPIRIT IN ACTS 5 , ANANIAS &quot;THOU HAS NOT LIED UNTO MEN, &quot;BUT UNTO GOD,&quot; THEY ACTED A LIE. THEY PRETENDED TO BE THEY WERE HYPOCRITES. AND THEY ACTED OUT A LIE. THE HOLY SPIRIT &quot;HOW IS IT THAT YE HAVE &quot;TO TEMPT THE SPIRIT MANY TIMES SINNERS SAY &quot;LET HIM STRIKE ME DEAD.&quot; THERE WAS A FELLOW YEARS AGO, DOWN IN TAMPA, FLORIDA AND HE STOOD OUT THERE AND HE SAID, &quot;ALL RIGHT,&quot; HE SAID, &quot;IF GOD IS GOD, &quot;I'M GONNA GIVE HIM &quot;AND LET HIM STRIKE ME DEAD.&quot; NOTHING HAPPENED. AND SOME OLD BROTHER &quot;YOU CANNOT EXHAUST &quot;IN ONE MINUTE.&quot; [laughter] BUT IT IS LIKE THE STORY THAT I HEARD ABOUT AND HE HAD LANDED THERE OF A SHEEP. AND UH, AS HE WAS HE WAS GETTING CLOSER AND AS HE GOT CLOSER SOMEBODY FROM THE SHORE &quot;WATCH OUT, OLD EAGLE! &quot;YOU'RE NEAR THE FALLS!&quot; BUT THE EAGLE &quot;WITH MY STRONG WINGS, &quot;I CAN GET UP OFF THIS BUT JUST AS HE CAME AND HE LIFTED THOSE WINGS, HE FOUND THAT HIS FEET AND HE COULDN'T, AND HE WENT SCREAMING YOU CAN TEMPT GOD. &quot;THOU SHALL NOT TEMPT YOU CAN WAIT TOO LONG. YOU CAN TEMPT GOD TOO LONG. AND THE DAY OR THE TIME WHEN IT'S NO LONGER POSSIBLE. AND THEN THE HOLY SPIRIT &quot;YE DO ALWAYS RESIST &quot;AS YOUR FATHERS DID, YOU CAN RESIST AND SOME OF YOU TONIGHT BUT YOU'VE BEEN RESISTING THAT'S A SIN AGAINST A SOLEMN THING YOU DETECT HIS VOICE, AND YET YOU DELIBERATELY IT'S A DANGEROUS THING. &quot;HE THAT DESPISED MOSES' LAW &quot;UNDER TWO OR THREE WITNESSES, &quot;OF HOW MUCH SORER &quot;SHALL HE BE THOUGHT WORTHY &quot;WHO HATH TRODDEN UNDER FOOT &quot;AND HATH COUNTED THE BLOOD &quot;WHEREWITH HE WAS SANCTIFIED, &quot;AND HAVE DONE DESPITE &quot;UNTO THE SPIRIT OF GRACE?&quot; RESISTING THE HOLY SPIRIT. TONIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RECEIVE CHRIST AND TO MAKE SURE OF THE BIBLE SAYS &quot;BEWARE LEST HE TAKE THEE AWAY &quot;WHEN A GREAT RANSOM MY SPIRIT SHALL NOT THERE COMES A TIME WHEN YOU GO BEYOND AND YOUR HEART GETS SO HARD THAT EVEN IF THE HOLY SPIRIT YOU CAN NO LONGER HEAR. THAT'S THE REASON COME TO CHRIST IN YOUR YOUTH, BEFORE THE EVIL DAYS WHEN YOUR HEART IS TENDER, ANYTIME YOU HEAR THE VOICE SAYING COME, YOU BETTER COME, YOU MAY NEVER HAVE &quot;HE THAT HARDENETH HIS HEART, &quot;SHALL SUDDENLY BE CUT OFF A FRIEND OF OURS AND HE CAME UP OVER A HILL, AND HE HAD HIS WIFE AND A MAN WHO WASN'T FAMILIAR AND HE CAME OVER THE HILL AND HE HIT THE SIDE AND BY THE TIME SHE WAS DEAD, NEVER DREAMING THIS MORNING A HAPPY, LITTLE FAMILY, THAT SHE WOULD BE GONE HOW QUICKLY IT ALL HAPPENS. COME WHEN YOU CAN. COME TO CHRIST YOU HAVE THAT TONIGHT. &quot;HE THAT BEING OFTEN REPROVED, &quot;SHALL SUDDENLY BE DESTROYED &quot;BOAST NOT THYSELF &quot;FOR THOU KNOWEST NOT WE DON'T KNOW THAT WE'LL BE YOU DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'LL HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE COME WHILE YOU CAN.

FIRST, YOU MUST AND THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS TO AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS BY FAITH YOU RECEIVE WHO DIED FOR YOU BY FAITH AS YOUR SAVIOR AND THEN THIRDLY, YOU ARE WILLING TO OBEY HIM THAT HE'LL SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT YOU MUST BE WILLING YOU MUST BE WILLING TO TURN AND HE BECOMES THE MASTER, HE BECOMES THE PILOT OR THE CAPTAIN OF YOUR AIRLINER. YOU'RE LIKE A PLANE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE DESTRUCTION WILL COME, UNLESS YOU LET JESUS AND BECOME THE PILOT. HE KNOWS ALL THE INSTRUMENTS. HE'S BEEN OVER THE ROUTE BEFORE, HE KNOWS ALL THE DANGERS. YOU TURN YOUR LIFE HE'LL HELP YOU AS YOU HEARD JONI AND KEN TELL SO BEAUTIFULLY. TURN YOUR LIFE OVER TO HIM AS MASTER AND LORD AND SAVIOR.
