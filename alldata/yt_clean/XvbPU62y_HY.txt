(upbeat music) - You eliminate the need for a generator. - To show you what it feels like to be on board of one of these - And right now you can before you run out of battery. - [Rico] That's a long way. - Hi guys. Welcome back to NautiStyles. Today we're doing something We actually leaving Rico at the dock because Udo and I, who I'm sure you remember Ocean Class 68. - Udo and I are taking Greenline 40 out to really show you what- - The hybrid system will do for you. - We are gonna really put it to the test. We're gonna show real numbers, real data, and you guys really get to to go out on the cruise on - And that's in a high wind - Yes, you guys, the We just heard that electricity and the crazy weather is coming. - [Rico] So don't be deceived by these beautiful blue skies - We've decided that because it has to be done. - Yes. - Let's do it. Let's take it out. - Bye, Rico. Well, I see you guys later. - Maybe. (energetic music) - Hey, I don't need to do anything. The boat is doing it by itself. (Rico laughs) (motor hums) We decided to pick you up after all. - We were just kidding. We can't do this without you. - [Rico] Exactly. Who has the camera, huh? - Look how nice and quiet we're coming in. All right, you're good. - He's on. - [Rico] Thanks for picking me up. - Well, yeah, we decided it's more fun. - We wanna do it without you, but then my camera had an error message so we kind of figure out - [Rico] What about the engine? You're not turning it on? - Yes, we are, running on electric. I mean, that's the beauty, one of the beauties of the hybrid. We are cruising the Fort Lauderdale River, the New River actually right now. And we are planning to cruising and listen to the sound of silence. - Well, we picked you up. All you heard was the bow and stern- - [Rico] Thruster, yeah. - That was the loud sound. - That's the loudest thing you hear when you're running on electric. - [Rico] That is incredible. - Pretty, pretty amazing. - [Rico] Yeah, it's very strange not to hear anything actually. - Most captains really have not hearing the diesel in the beginning. You have to restart the whole process on - [Rico] It's so strange. You hear very, very, very little bit, I mean, just a small bit of but so little. - It's actually what you hear is the shafts in the shaft seals. - [Rico] Huh? - Because you would not - [Rico] Yeah, oh wow. This thing has quite a pickup. - Yep. If you need to get out of the way, you're gonna punch it and it goes. The current is ripping pretty good, so we gotta have to put a rudders to get better control of the boat. - [Rico] Yeah. - So as soon as we get out of the river, then we can play around a little more with your electric unit. But if you need to get out - [Rico] And it doesn't - [Victoria] It is completely You just hear the water and that's it. - And that's the beauty The hull originally was So this boat is equipped with twin 14 kilowatt electric motors. 28 kilowatts equals roughly 32, 35 horsepower. And we pushed that boat with 35 horsepower. And we are in a 40 foot boat with an almost 14 foot beam. - [Rico] That's pretty good. - And just cruising like I mean, it's just the most - You know the Inner Coastal and The Great Loop is basically the best environment for the hybrid. You have a slow zone, you go in electric. You have a speed zone, you're switching over to diesel. And as soon as you switch to diesel, you recharging your batteries because you're electric motors turn into two 10 kilowatt generators. We will do that as soon as switching back and forth. I'm sorry, I have to- - We can't turn it off completely. We know we gotta have it on. - I have to listen because we have a lot of traffic everybody is bringing the up the river to get out of - No, you guys, we were not joking. We really have a hurricane on the way. I mean, not a hurricane, a tropical storm. Which might hopefully not, but- - Hopefully not, but we will have some nasty weather regardless. So this is our last day to get this done because this yacht has been sold and the owner is kind enough So we are super, super thankful and excited that we get to do this because we've been wanting - Can you do me a favor? - Flip in the fenders. Are you embarrassed? - Okay, okay, okay. (Udo laughs) We thought that's how We see it all the time. (Rico laughs) Especially in Haulover. - And you probably saw having the side door right here, you can handle your spring glede. - Is very convenient. - I mean for anybody who's not a Viking. What are you saying? - For me this is a perfect door. No problem at all. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. You make everything look You're not the great like boat model. - They use me at a factory. If I fit in a cabin, it's a good size. That makes total sense. - [Udo] Right now we have 98%. We drawing 295 watts on the boat because we just turned the AC off. - [Rico] Yep. 30 watts of solar power because at 98, you hardly We need to drop below 90 and 80 that the solar is gonna kick in. We will drain the battery right so that we can show how the solar works. This particular boat is equipped with six solar panels with 330 watt each. - What is the capacity - On the 40, that's a twin engine boat. It comes standard with two and you can upgrade it up to four. So you can do three or four, you can maximum of four. But even in the standard almost 28 kilowatt hours. - Yep. Oh wow, we only draining 300 watts. - [Udo] Yeah. - [Udo] Plus the motors. Right now that's only for the boat. This shows you only the boat. - Oh, got it, got it. that's gonna show us minus 148 amps what we - [Rico] That's in amps. And what's the voltage? - [Udo] We doing 60 volts. - 60 times 145, right. - [Victoria] So what you're saying is, it's gonna be on the screen the conversion will be - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Victoria] 'Cause you are - So the engine's using like the boat is using like - Let's call it repo or hybrid battery. - Got it. a house bank. The house is a 12-volt what the pumps, and everything on 12 volt. - Yeah. the hybrid battery, runs on 60 volts. - So that means we charge with the solar. We charge the litho And when you run the diesel, your E units charge the litho batteries which is 20 kilowatt. - So then your inverter, and your inverter converts So that's why you have That's your 110 screen. This 290 watts is for 110. - Yeah. it's getting a little warm. If you want to turn on the in the breaker port, Just turn 'em on real quick. Then we see the difference. It's on a lower bank. There's a main breaker. There is the main and then all the three Now we turned on the air condition. That is one of the biggest You eliminate the need for generator. - Yeah. - So no more listening, no more smelling, no more feeling vibration, and no more servicing a generator. - Yeah. one of the biggest beauties- - But we still don't- - [Udo] Yeah, it takes awhile. Yeah, yeah. All these air air condition So that means the way it's programmed so they're not kicking - Yeah. a tropical air condition because it's been ordered for Florida. The tropical air condition On a normal use, you get along with one. If you have a hot, hot humid day and you lock the boat up and you run it, then one is definitely not gonna make it. But in a lot of times Worst case scenario, three units and you cool your boat down. - Yeah. you see? - 1200 watts. One unit has So with one unit you can always So when you running one on a humid Florida hot night, it's gonna cycle in and out. And you usually go through about three to three and a half kilowatt. You got almost 30 kilowatts stored. - Yeah, so you have plenty. - You got plenty. We manage now on Florida boat shows and in Miami boat show keep the door open to the never plug the boat in. It's all about how you - That is pretty impressive. - So when you get the tropical you get a whole windscreen set. So you have screens for It's a see-through, but it blocks about 95% UV - So it doesn't heat - So now when you're on one unit is almost ever enough when you've got covered Now I can turn the radio off because we are out of the river. The first question we how far can I go? - [Victoria] Yeah. Can I cross that Atlantic - No. I mean- - [Victoria] I mean can you? You probably could do a lot of things, but maybe we shouldn't. - People go down the Niagara - [Victoria] Correct. It's very true. - [Victoria] Is it advisable? No. - So you know we post on diesel alone. So theoretically if you Scotland, Iceland, yes you could do it. And people've done it. I don't know about the Greenline, but people done it in much smaller boats. - [Victoria] Of course. - We always post, you have a range of 20 But that is a very unfair But we gotta post something. And I usually use examples trying what can you do? A few years ago, my wife and me, we took a 40 to the Miami Boat Show and they said we gotta - [Victoria] Yeah. at 6:45 in the morning. - Yeah. on the diesel. We had 98% battery. We went on the inside. We arrived at 8:45. The boat show was not ready, so we were circling, we in front of the boat show till it was our turn to tie up. By the time we tied up it was 12:45. - Oh wow. (Victoria and Rico laugh) So when I had the boat I had 12.2 hours on the So we traveled for 17 nautical miles. We boated for six hours. We still had 98% battery and only put 20 minutes on the diesel. - Yeah. let's slow it down, when we were putting around going in gear and out- you don't use much throttle at all, right. - We're recharging faster. - Than we were burning that's why we came in. - So if you just do idle forward- - [Victoria] I can see it, you guys. - [Udo] So now you see the 22 we got two AC units going. - [Rico] Yeah. we're drawing 2000 watts, This is the combined draw - [Rico] Oh, okay. - [Udo] When you turn the then you will see this Here we go, now it gets real quiet. So actually the fan from - It's louder than- the engine. Here, hold on, you guys, give you a real sound here. Nothing. - So now you see a 200-watt draw. - Yeah. - [Udo] That one is down to 11. But now you see 1100 watts - [Rico] Oh wow. - [Udo] Yeah, because - [Rico] Look at that. - So now the way I can draw power more, you see this, when I used so now the battery charger will kick in and that's your battery the 12 volt system. So the battery charger, the lithium 60-volt DC the battery charger is plugged into 110 and that's how you recharge - [Rico] That's fine. - [Rico] Yeah. your 12 volt system gets charged either through the battery charger or as soon as we fire up the diesels, the alternator will take over that job and recharge it. - So that gives you always redundancy because you always have solar, you always have 110 then, and you always have a battery charger, so you never run out of battery. - [Rico] We don't have We're still charging like almost 1200. - [Udo] Yeah, it's compensating completely what the boat is using right now. - [Rico] Yeah. now minus four, that is but it will get compensated So now you will see and now we see how the - [Rico] Oh yeah. Yeah, minus 500, almost 600. - [Udo] And the bow thruster is the loudest thing on the whole. - [Victoria] It's truly the - And you know I made so much fun. We have that sandbar over there and sometimes people drifting then you sneak up beside them and when you right beside them and they're sleeping in a and then. (Udo laughs) - So true, because you don't expect it. - No, it's literally stealth mode. - Don't expect. First of all, the convenience The next thing is the redundancy. The way the boat is designed, we have two 12-volt batteries Two 12-volt batteries One each motor and a house battery. That's your 12 volt system. So if you would run really, you can parallel all this together and get the diesel started. So if you are gonna be somewhere up north when you have 40 hours and you would run your batteries down, you can always get the diesel started. You always have backup up for the backup the way the boat is designed. And now you here, I mean, we cruising down the canal. We hear only the water. - [Rico] You don't need much power. Like if you do this inner coastal or site arms. - And, as I said, it's 14 kilowatts each. Look when I floor it. It picks up speed quick. - [Rico] Oh yeah, I - [Udo] The knots going up. Look at this. - [Rico] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Udo] Seven, seven, - [Rico] We're gonna get to eight. I don't know if we have current going in- - [Udo] Yeah, got a little bit current, so it's seven four, seven six, seven seven. - [Udo] Almost eight. So on electrical. - [Rico] Seven nine, - So now let's bring it back a little bit. Let's look at the hybrid and motor gauges. These two are our hybrid That gives you first of all how much amps the motor is gonna draw. Your temperature, it's in 36 So I'm going on zero. The 1.8 amps is what you need to get the clutch because as soon as you're on electric, you disengage your diesel, And then we have a 12 volt and the 12-volt pump for the fresh water. - [Rico] So that's the little amperage. - So that's the little amperage. That's the thing when you go now we have a little current and the wind, so you really need to because you don't have the feeling. Yeah, just floor it on the Then you get a feeling for the electric. - Pretty responsive actually. - Yes, it's responsive, So you gotta get the use for And now we turn the radio off. Now there's no wind, no noise, no nothing. It's just a a little winding noise what's coming actually what you will never hear - Yeah you would never hear it. You would only hear the diesel engine. - And when you raft that you hear a little the prop cavitation. You hear all that stuff because - Yeah. - So the noise you hear is coming from all this other elements what a diesel motors always covers over. - So true. Let's go stop - So what we do then we are what is a real simple task, but we all do everything manual we want to keep the system - [Victoria] We're all for that. - Which I like. - I'm not a huge fan of This was good. Give it a little. When you start boating with electric, you start a completely different boating. When I grew up using a We had to learn how to operate the motors. - Yeah. only with the motors and then you look at and then you turn it with the motors and the bow and stern thruster, you are way more efficient. - So the same is when where we have tight corners I quite often use my bow thruster and way more efficient- - Than using the- - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. the whole way you operate a boat. And it's actually fun. I mean all our customers, they set all this up on their smartphone. So they monitor their boats, they play with the charge - So you can set it - On your iPhone, iPad. - Smartphone, yes. I had a customer, he was &quot;My maintenance man, I can't reach him and my boat is losing battery power. I don't know what's going on. Can you check it?&quot; So he had his whole boat, wherever you are in the world, - That's pretty cool. This reminds me actually of sailing. - [Victoria] Okay, you're on a 40 footer, so it's not like you - Nope. like you're on a Duffy. You don't have any noise, like. - I really don't feel comfortable to compare the Greenline to a Duffy. (Rico and Udo laugh) - [Victoria] But the sound. It's nothing. Because the Duffies you never hear. I think it's pretty amazing that you don't have any sound. It's so quiet. It's just a little humming. - Just gotta throw that in. I got a new present today. I got this floating glasses today. - [Victoria] Oh somebody Thanks for the shout out. We kind of felt like it was a good match with the Yacht Sales International logo. What do you guys think with the orange. He's like rocking the orange. Nice. - Fit's right with our theme, so. - [Victoria] Very nice. - Let's bring the motors to neutral. In the beginning, it's because you don't feel it, So now we switch here to diesel. - [Rico] Just switch over. - [Udo] To diesel, yes. Now push the start button. And the other start button. And now- - [Victoria] I heard it. - [Victoria] Feel it? - That's it. That's it. Now you're going in diesel. Let me turn off that blower right now. We don't need that. There we go. What a difference. - [Victoria] Oh yeah. Greenline is always about comfort and quietness. - So now you see your - [Rico] Yeah. Now we are in generation mode. We are not in motor mode anymore. - [Rico] Yeah. because we do not put a load on the motor in idle because we do not want to overload. Achso... ....a little bit. And here- - Now you see the charge coming in. Now we are recharging with 32 and if you are on inner because on electric mode you three quarter load or And then when you What means you recharge it Our 1,000 mile range is on diesel alone. So if you're going to use you can extend that tremendously. - A lot. - [Victoria] You're - You're switching back and forth. Because what a lot of people do not understand. - Sometimes I say it's free energy and anybody would say, There is no such thing as free energy. - Or if you're going anyways, yes it is. - So the difference is you and a propeller efficiency curve. And right there in the middle, that energy goes down into the exhaust, and that's where we So we generate electricity with So if you get it around because there's another sandbar right here and then we switch back to electric. Okay, so I think we are and see where we drift. Turn on the diesels. Now we switch to electric. - [Rico] Do you have to - [Udo] No, switch to electric and now you wait when it to engine motor. - And now we can you go. The reason for that delay disengage the diesel completely, otherwise the momentum - And that's done electrically? - Yes, that's a hydraulic. - It's electric hydraulic clutch. And I will show that later how that works. It's actually a very simple system and the way it is that simple, any mechanic slash boat and that's it. There is no very high tech gimmicks. You don't need a rocket Or maintain it. - [Victoria] Let's talk about The Loop. Have you ever done it? - [Udo] The Great Loop - [Victoria] Okay, so same here. We've yet to do it. It's totally something And initially like the &quot;Man, this is a really great boat for it.&quot; First of all, the bridge clearance- - [Udo] Yeah. You don't have to think about it. - [Udo] No. boats right now that are doing The Loop? - Actually this year, we have four customers doing - Wow. And I think next year we are on the Great Loop at the same time. What happened when the The Great Loop, it went like a wildfire. Everybody said, &quot;We need one too. That's the perfect boat to do it.&quot; Specifically, when you most of the time is idling. - [Victoria] Yeah. - So here we are, with this system you out of your idling hours. - Also, speaking of resale for example, people always look at engine hours. It's one factor of resale and value. - Back to my examples, we what the gentleman bought in 2019 from us. He kept it here in Fort Lauderdale and they used the boat every week, once, twice a week. They went to The Bahamas. They went to Fort Myers, to the Keys. A lot of trips. When we took the boat back I looked at the hour meters, We pulled out the hours We do that. We plug in and - [Rico And Victoria] Yeah. - There were over 15 in Fort Lauderdale between and he never turned on - [Victoria] 15 hours. No 1500. - [Victoria] Oh, 1500. - Yeah, yeah. - Now we had had a 370 hour boat instead of almost 2000 hour boat. - That is incredible. - So, and the Great Loop boats, we will see when the with the Great Loop, they come back with less than - [Victoria] That's to see those numbers. - [Victoria] I'm so curious. I think you should have - Anybody who knows diesel will probably agree that it's to just idle at all the time. It's just bad for the motor. Like the ideal load percentage of a diesel engine is around 80%. That's what they like to be running. So the good thing is if hybrid boat in general, you run the diesel engine at 60 to 80% because that's what you do And then you switch it off So it's actually the best of both worlds. - Yeah, well we just left our dock in downtown Fort Lauderdale, when we do a sea trial, if you're firing up your diesel, you're doing your lines, - It's just- - Yep. 15, 20 minute sea trials. We go back. It's at least an hour, by the time you got tied up So doing the sea trial is and three hours on the meters. So when I do the same like we took off all on electric. Just before I get to the inlet, I'm firing up the diesel to Do my 15, 20 minute sea trials, come back on electric. So I'm putting between 15 and 30 minutes. So now 10 sea trials. - 30 hours, but hour - [Victoria] I also think Marina Del Ray in California. You know where we did a lot of our boating is you- - [Victoria] You do harbor cruises, which you will never turn on the diesel. You go out of the marina, you come back in, takes you 20 minutes. And when you out there, Like there is no real destination Malibu or you're going to Catalina Island. - Yeah. you're just taking people out, your friends for an hour This makes so much sense. - Yeah. And here in the Lauderdale area, what we do a lot is go We have so many restaurants and bar where you go bar hopping. - [Victoria] Yeah, you guys do. - You do have a designated - Of course, always. - The wind and the current right now. - [Victoria] Yeah, it's pushing us. Wow. that's what I said. Look at this now. - The thruster, right. - Look at this. - Look at this. - How much quicker makes- - There's no point. - And you're wasting a lot to try to fight- It's not a shame to use a bow thruster. - [Victoria] The bow thruster. - [Victoria] But you called &quot;You're not used to it.&quot; It used to be like if you don't need it. You don't use it. But this is different. - As long as I'm boating, back in the days we And when they came up it was like, &quot;Look at this guy, he So they having a bow It makes boating so much - [Victoria] Well you gotta grow with the technology as well, right? When you have it, you use it. You also don't use use it, it goes bad. Everything you don't use - If you don't use it, you lose it. - [Victoria] Yeah, 100%. - This is awesome right now. Just idle forward. - We're going a little and the wind's coming from behind. - [Victoria] Let's go show - And right now you can before you run out of battery. - That's a long ways. 35 and a half. - Yeah, we got more sun you're recharging faster with the solar than you're discharging. - Ah. - Oh we have 37. - [Victoria] Wow. - [Udo] Right now we are doing. - [Rico] 39. but we have a wind and we but we are burning less energy than the solar panel recharges. - This is incredible. - [Victoria] Just doing little You're not going anywhere anyway. You just wanna be out in the water. - Yeah. That's why there's the wrong statement. - Yeah, you can't really. - But you cannot say whatever. - People want the number. So you have to be like, &quot;Okay, this is a definite realistic and then the real way - No. It's completely different. - [Victoria] Makes sense. - And so if you are gonna I mean you can go so - [Victoria] I like how because you're making him - Yeah, because you're - [Victoria] You're standing down there. - No, no, no, stay there. - No, do me a favor, sit down. And I'll get your feet up all the way up. Now you can stand. - What I can look outside - [Victoria] What? - [Victoria] Oh my God. - And now the seating position... - [Victoria] It's like a I thought it was just a little step. - [Udo] So- - Now you can look even through the roof. - Ah, look at that. - [Victoria] Oh, it's great. - [Rico] I really like this boat. - [Victoria] Pretty cool. You wanna do the loop? - [Victoria] With me? You We'll do the loop together. - Can you rent one to us? (Rico laughs) - We are looking for and putting it in charter so many customers want - [Victoria] You guys know who to contact. There you go. We really, really, really would support that a lot if somebody and put it in charter. - So cool. All right, how quiet it is. What it feels like on the exterior when you out cruising like that. - [Rico] All right. we'll show you the whole tour, but we just wanna give you to show you what it of one of these underway on electric. And all you hear is water. You cannot tell me that this - [Rico] It's almost weird. - And you have a freedom to go anywhere we want without tacking - [Rico] You know how it feels? It feels like you're getting towed. - Yes, it feels like you're getting towed. 100% agree. That's a good observation. - [Rico] Right? - [Rico] Just hear some water sound and that's it. All right, maybe we should give you guys a little bit of an exterior tour and then take you on an interior and show you what this - [Rico] Perfect. Let's do it. - All right. - Yeah. fold down swim platform. - Very, very cool. Oh my gosh, Bahamas. Fantastic. like, you know anybody who owns a pet, a dog, has small children, grandchildren, whatever it might be, it's completely closed in and you're completely safe underway. - Super safe. So easy, but also so useful. Really like it. We're gonna open up some of these hatches and give you guys more of a once we come back into the dock. We're trying to do it while which is about to change. - [Rico] Another thing, obviously, you wouldn't necessarily in like a hurricane but if you do have some - This is nice. it's definitely nice. - Agreed. So a couple of seats here. Looks like there's a bit - [Rico] This one is open, yeah. - Yeah.... Shore power cable in there...That's where we shore power. Exactly. We have side - [Rico] We also have the as well as a shore water inlet. - And here our emergency bilge pump. - [Rico] That's right. The cleats, the way they're mounted on top of the bulwarks If you are not super mobile and go and bend down and a dock line onto these cleats, - And they also thought about, it's very useful because docked as well, this was all used, and the shafing protection - [Rico] Yeah. - That line was running across. Okay, we're gonna go forward. Keep in mind you guys, this is a 40. I think it's very, very safe. Most of the time I feel like You everything is a bit more exposed. - [Rico] Sure. Of course, you are going but it is very safe and very well protected for kids and pets. - [Rico] Agreed, agreed. Okay, go forward and look, now I can actually walk We have our side windows here - [Rico] Yeah, you've got - Cross breeze. - [Rico] Towards bow. Cup holders. Yeah, and a layout cushion. There's a bimini that - [Rico] So normally actually cushion going, but with a strong winds we're having. - We are prepping for that - [Rico] I hope you can hear us properly because it is a little windy. - It's definitely windy. - [Rico] But let's walk through. We have the bow, really nice - Yeah. So you have the bimini that you could put up. That looks like a little - [Rico] Exactly. And then I was a bad deckhand and I just threw this line here because I wasn't sure So that's me. That's not how it's normally supposed, that's on me, okay. - [Rico] You got the windlass here and then the anchor set It's almost like a pocket anchor. It is a pocket anchor. - [Victoria] Ah. - [Rico] It is actually as you guys can see there. - [Victoria] Oh yeah. - [Rico] Like a big boat. - Oh, how cool. That's very unusual. Really like it. - They did everything proper, you know, just to protect the boat from any chafing. The teak looks really nice, yeah. - [Rico] So we got the - Yep, let's check it out. - [Rico] Oh, lots of storage too. - Tons, and there is a Yeah, and the chain is so it's not just making you - [Rico] Yeah, we got a windshield wiper on each of the windshields. We have a searchlight. We have a forward facing camera actually. The radar, TV antenna, and - And you could see right there, the solar panels are nicely raised just to allow them to have the airflow and the breeze so they - [Rico] And also they onto the roof. - [Rico] Into the cabin. - They really did a good job there. - [Rico] Well, ventilated, yeah. - Exactly. Look at this huge sunroof. - [Rico] I know. - [Rico] I know. it's great if you're really cruising. You really can turn off and you just- - Enjoy the breeze. Oh, you guys can feel the breeze. - [Rico] Oh, wow this feels different. - Yeah. Why is this? This feels so much wide, is this wider? The whole cabin is offset and more cabin space. - [Rico] Oh, this is brilliant. Instead of losing the cabin space, because you make both wide, you make one a little bit wider. - [Udo] Yep. - [Rico] And the other - You guys- - Is so much easier to walk on. So this is your main side. So when you jump out of this here, you can easily. docking side because and that's your main side. The other side is if you - I've yet to see that and I think that's absolutely brilliant. Yeah, I can. - Very comfortably walk. - [Rico] You can comfortably walk here. - So we have our diesel fuel here. They've got rails everywhere. All right, should we go on the interior? - [Rico] Yes. We'll show you guys the interior. sliding door here and - So this window opens up. - [Udo] Yeah, open the latches and then it pops out automatically. (upbeat music) - [Rico] Wow. down the back side. - [Udo] There we go. - [Rico] Wow, look at that. - Check this out. That really extends. - [Rico] I mean that's how I probably, I would use the boat all the I probably would never close it. - 100%. it's too hot that you need air condition. - Yeah. you open the side or you open the sunroof, open this here. - Oh look, somebody left - [Rico] Oh, someone left the key for us. Just put it in the pocket. - Just put it in the pocket. This is cool, really cool. I mean you could put a couple A little bar stools. - [Rico] That's what I would get probably. Just like little like foldable, like director chairs. yeah, that works. So crazy how loud the bow stern thruster is. This thing turns, huh? - Yeah. All right, so we've got two burner induction cooktop, sink, microwave oven, some drawers here. Here as well. Oh, very nice. Very cool, it's got this little ledge to make sure it's all good. - [Rico] I found more drawers. - [Rico] Sorry. - [Rico] Yeah, there are three more drawers here, very large. - [Victoria] Open the bottom one. - [Rico] Oh, I get to open stuff, yay. - Yeah, maybe just for a little bit. I'm assuming it's a fridge. - [Udo] The freezer and look for 40 a foot boat. - Ah, yeah, this makes me - [Rico] Oh wow. - This is great. - [Rico] That's a bigger in our condo. - You can totally, totally do The Loop. I do have a question for you. If you are leaving your boat somewhere, like let's say you're out in the anchor and you've got the fridge, How does it work with - Yeah, that's the beauty. I mean, you can leave that and we had customers because it's completely self-sustaining. You can put it on a mooring ball and run your fridge and freezer never run out of it. - No way. - [Rico] That's amazing. - We had a couple, they waited 20 years to get - [Rico] Oh wow. - Was a 20 year waiting period. And then as soon as they got the go, they had six months to otherwise they lose it. They came and bought the Because that's the only where you can leave on not cleaning out your fridge and freezer every time you leave. - It is brilliant. It is so true. I mean, we have friends, you know, they're not live aboards and they're constantly because they're also thinking like, &quot;Well, what if the electricity goes out?&quot; Then you know, everything goes bad. They come back to their boat. The freezer is melted, stuff's gone. Like stuff is bad. - [Rico] Now imagine having and yeah, you don't want - It happens all the time. - [Rico] I know. I know. - You with you yacht a few times. - Come back to check on the boat and everything in the fridge went bad. - [Rico] Yeah. Thanks for driving, Udo. (Udo laughs) Piloting. Okay, we have a Some drawers. These are cool. I like these. We have a popup TV looks like. - This table is high, low table and there's a cushion or a lounge out of it. There is a deadbolt in the center, just take it out. Just unbolt it. - [Udo] Yeah, keep turning it for a while and then you can move your table. The only way you really need to bolt down is when you're in really rough water. - Oh, I see what you're saying. It's, yeah, it's a anchor points. - [Udo] Yeah, we need if you want to get to the engine. So now you can move your table. - Just slide it. - [Udo] Wherever you want. - That's a soft rubber. - Rubber things on it. - So, you can move the table further back, so it's out of the way - Oh, so cool. So you can put it high put a cushion on it, and make it a full-blown bed. - [Udo] Right. - Okay, more storage. - That is- - That's your breaker panel. - [Rico] So you got the battery switches down there on the bottom, then the inverter remote, and the breaker panel for the high voltage and the low-voltage DC and AC. - And remind me when we on the first time I've seen it has a dial for your shore power intake. So this boat is equipped with a 50 N cord. So you can dial it up to 50 So you can dial it down like If you come into marina, you can put a pigtail on - [Rico] And it's perfectly fine. - And you never blow. You can even go to 110 to 20 amps and then the inverter will and the solar power, what you need more than what So you don't have to cut Even if you go to a regular 110 outlet. - [Rico] Yeah. operate your boat. - [Rico] So you take whatever you can get and the boat will supplement the rest. - Supplement with the - [Rico] Love it. - You guys look how You have a 360-degree view, pretty much. - [Rico] Yeah, yeah You open that up, you have that door open, you have these windows - [Rico] You see the waterline. - You feel like you're outside. Pretty amazing. and people ask me, &quot;Why does Greenline don't put the 40-foot fly bridge?&quot; - Yeah. very proud of their performance. We have the lowest standoff gravity. You see that it's not a from the cockpit all the way through. That gives us extreme You see, we had so much big boat traffic, we had so much wind, the boat ain't moving. - So you don't need a gyro, whatever, it's extremely stable. And that's why we say we do not want to go below 45 foot with of flybridge because that's when - [Rico] Makes sense. it makes total sense. - And you have great visibility. I mean really if you like you have that and you're just standing and you can see everything. - You have almost 360, the only little blockage But here you got your side door and then you got that covered. - 100%. Is there any storage underneath? - Yes, there's storage underneath here. This is- I'm not gonna open. - No, this is the cabin. - [Udo] That's the cabin you That's the guest cabin port. - So these are just for fun? - [Udo] Yes. - I can tell you one out on the ocean, I put it - You just sit here. - [Rico] Sometimes just to change, right? - Yeah. - I love it. - Yeah, oh yeah. You could hang out here. - Yeah. and hang out. It's pretty cool. All right, I haven't been on it guys. - [Rico] Me neither. we're exploring. explore right now. So let's see, oh, okay. All right, let's start here. - [Rico] Going to port. - Yeah, we're gonna go to port first. - [Udo] And we got this little- - Hi again. for natural ventilation. - Trying to hide from Udo and we can't. - [Udo] The air condition, you can ventilate the - This is awesome. - [Rico] You do have the And a porthole as well. - Oh my god. This makes Udo, let's do it. - [Rico] This is a very - [Udo] Yeah and this super inner bed, you can slide them to - [Rico] Yeah. a little sitting area here. You can slide it into a one bed. Those cushions are from upstairs. You can make the bed there as well. And then let's see here, what do we got? Here's our closet, hanging locker. You'll still have a little - [Rico] Like open storage. You can also put a And if you know, make And check these out. - [Rico] Oh, what's- - [Rico] Yeah. - [Victoria] And you have - [Rico] Exactly. - Oh, that's cool. And of course you have a shade here, privacy curtain basically So we're gonna go forward and we have our owner suite basically. - [Rico] Wow. So it's a two cabin, one shared head. - [Rico] Look how big this bed is. - It's huge. - [Rico] This is like a - What do you call it, quing - [Rico] A queen, a boat- - [Rico] Yeah, a quing. - Hanging locker here. Same thing. Storage all the way on outboard. - [Rico] On both sides. And these are the windows And if you open them up- - It is really nice. Man, this boat is very stable. - [Rico] Yeah. - [Rico] No. And then on this side we And let's check out our head. What's this? - [Rico] Battery switch. It might be for the bow thruster. - Got it. And then right here - [Rico] Well, it's - Yes. Or we can use it as a day head or shared head with this cabin. If you are a couple just You'll use this as an en-suite and as your day head. Wow, this is really good. - [Rico] Very comfortable. - Yeah. So you have a one Some- - Access to the tank. - [Rico] So an electric head, sink. - A bit of a storage here. Actually, pretty good. - [Rico] And still an openable pothole. - You can open it. - There's a porthole that you can open. - [Rico] Amazing, amazing for a couple. Pretty awesome. Udo is communicating because and down the river. - [Udo] I copy that. - I'm going up. It's a little Pretty cool down there. That's a lot of room for a 40 footer. - [Rico] So you have a - No, actually steel door So I'm gonna wait for them So for the non people we have our landmark, used to be a girls school. So when you come in the new river, you're gonna announce that so other boaters know where you are. You don't want to be here and. - [Radio] Countdown to church marker 12. - And get surprised by steel That can get really tricky. And especially if the Jungle Queen, I don't know if you're It's a big stern wheeler. - [Rico] Oh yeah, yeah. - [Rico] I've seen that - Yeah, when they come out you want to be out of their way. - [Rico] Yeah. - They'll take you with them. - [Udo] Usually these guys - [Rico] Yeah. Surprised they're actually towing a little sailboat. - [Udo] They usually do that when they have mechanical issues. (upbeat music) And I used to myself, when we do survey on older, bigger boats, you know, something can go wrong... - [Victoria] Better safe than sorry. - [Rico] You will hire the tow to get the boat down the - Actually you maybe remember Mobjack when we did the survey on Mobjack. - Yeah. - The 90-foot Cheoy Lee. - [Rico] Oh, that's right. The boat was sitting for a while. - And I said let's not And we took it out with steel tow and then when we went on the survey, of course one motor failed. And if you have a motor - Very bad situation. - You do not wanna go sideways this way. And then we went to the and got everything fixed and going. That's when I say, I mean if a captain has to that's one thing. But if you gonna have one issue, there's- - [Rico] No, better be safe than sorry. - Look at the current right now here. There's no recovery if something- - [Victoria] There's no need. No need to be a hero. - [Udo] No. the cool thing is on this boat you have a backup. - That's true. - You have four motors. So if you lose your If you lose the diesel, you - All right, we're going back in. - [Rico] So you're gonna - It is definitely windy. And there is a current. And so you guys get to see how easy it is to dock this boat. - It's a strong current. Look at this. Woo. Really good current. (upbeat music) - So right now I'm using the current, which is very strong to put me in position. I'm in neutral. And now I'm putting my and bow thruster- - In that very tight spot. - [Rico] Yeah. from the bridge coming. What is the worst scenario So the beauty is when I'm - [Rico] You just slow it down, right. - Now I can put it in reverse. And the slowness of the electric motor. Look at this. With the diesel in and out. - Now I've gotta put this one in reverse and I'm gonna hold the boat - [Rico] Slowing down, yeah. - Clutching in and out. Both motors in gear and we are easing in. Now I'm actually slowing it down too much. And we're easing into the slip with no diesel clutch in and out. That electric propulsion makes - [Rico] Oh yeah. - Now I can go out to my spring cleat. (upbeat music) Even in worst hurricane it's very easy to manage. So we've been boating now - [Rico] Yeah. for maybe 10 minutes. Just for demonstration. - Just for demonstration reasons. - [Rico] How much battery - Right now we got 63%. Earlier when we had solar, we went 34 hours on 15 hours. So it bounces back and forth. Here we have right now and everything. - That changes a lot. But we would have plenty to keep going. - [Rico] So does the boat even - No and yes, because you don't have a third generator but you got two generator - That's what you always say. - [Rico] Yeah. we call it the e-unit. It's either generator. - Or motor. - So we got two 10 kilowatt generator to recharge the batteries. - [Rico] That's just- - Powered by the main propulsion diesel. - You guys are torturing everybody not showing the engine room. - [Rico] We gotta show the engine room. Do we have to turn anything - No, we are all good. We're gonna go right into (upbeat music) - [Rico] Oh., it's just a D three. - [Victoria] Easy. - With a D three, we reaching about 23, 23 and a half knots. - So we have a comfortable and 19 on diesel. We get it up to eight knot on electric. I recommend between four and a half and five knots cruise on electric. That's where you get the And then sometimes you see you're losing 0.1 knot but you So it's all about how - Yeah. right here. And to explain the system, let me stand on the plate. We have a standard Volvo D 3. Then here is our E unit. On top is the electric activator clutch is the automotive steel and the E unit. And then you have a standard CF gear box. Let me turn on the electric I'm gonna turn on the ignition. - [Rico] And there we go. - [Udo] Now we are on electric. So the actuator that disengages the motor, now I'm turning on the motor Now we are moving forward. So now when switching back to diesel then the clutch engages the diesel and you turn on the motors and you go. - [Rico[ It's great. Yep, straight shaft, dripless You still a lot of space - Yeah, it's pretty good On the Greenline, the 33, the 39 and the The 45, 48 have V drives and the new 58 will have V drives too. So we move the motors in the we have cabins right here. - I'm just thinking, I the engines are actually in trim of the boat. - It's because you have no wind aft. - Nope, nope. - So you always have - Right. And then we have two fuel tanks with the equalizer pipe, two water tanks with an equalizer pipe. So when you fill up water, half of it you don't have and it's always perfectly balanced. - You just showed us how and engages again, how you switch over. What would happen if this mechanism, for some reason is not working? - It's a spring loaded system. So the clutch would engage the diesel and you can run home on diesel. - Got it. that's the thing. Whatever reason you lose power, then the diesel will still So that gives you two diesels So either if two diesels fail, you can go home on electric. If both electric motors would But that incredible is - Actually- - [Victoria] Then you're - It's actually pretty interesting because when we run the diesel engines- - [Victoria] Yeah. - It wasn't that loud. - Considering because I - [Victoria] Me too. - Considering they're - [Victoria] I really thought - Yeah. Yeah. - [Victoria] All you - Yeah. - And you turned blowers off, - [Victoria] You didn't - Very, very, very quiet. - [Victoria] Yeah. So what's aft? - Aft, you have your lazarette. - [Victoria] Oh. - [Victoria] Holy, what? - [Victoria] It's connected. it's one big storage. - [Rico] You can load it through, right? I mean what are put in it? OMG... - [Victoria] Blow up - [Rico] Toys. You can put anything. So much space. - Put some deck chairs if you - Deck chairs. So true. - Can I put a dinghy in there? - Actually we had actually - [Victoria] Foldable. - That fit in there. Let me close the sunroof - We literally just made it in time and it starts to rain, you guys. We are so lucky. So lucky. - So the beauty is you So when you have a back you can walk off the boat and when you're gone you can close it so nobody can enter your boat. - [Rico] That's pretty good. - [Victoria] Absolutely love that. It's like your own little Passerelles. - Look how much of an extension It's really large. So where's your swim ladder? - The swim ladder is on the side. - [Victoria] Yeah, you saw it right there. - And. - Okay. This is great. - I usually stop it right here and then you're going secure it. - [Rico] You're gonna secure it, yeah. (upbeat music) - All righty you guys, thank Thanks for taking. - Thanks for coming. - I had so much fun cruising - We've been talking - [Rico] I know. - Literally for a year. We're I wanna go out on one of these Make sure you are following We'll put Udo's information underneath the video if you or Greenline Ocean Class. - Yeah. - Really enjoy the Outtakes. Ciao! Bye! The folks from California - Is he talking smack about California? - No, never. I would never do that. We even have fans from the side here. - Hello. for Greenline yachts. And I just said we got some - The wind and the rain. Look, we could have came in Enjoy the Outtakes. Do the honors. - [Rico] Do we have any outtakes? - I'm sure we do. The Outtakes. - The Outtakes? at the end of every video. - Okay. - [Rico] I guess we never - Yes. So, oh, that's the Outtakes. - That's the Outtakes. This - [Rico] Yeah, this is an Outtake. - What just happened is an Outtake. - I'm learning. I'm learning here. I'm new to this game. - When we have someone who we like, we usually allow them to
