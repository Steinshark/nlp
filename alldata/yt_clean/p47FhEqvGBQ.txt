Today I'm going on an underwater date and to prove to mrbeast I have what it But to recap the last video, which is dangerous. My dad is really worried I So we're using my apple watch If it's under 95%, Stay tuned to see if I can go on the craziest date ever. It's not doing anything. It's cause it knows we're 6ft underwater. It's not working because he's 6ft under water. So maybe if you go up there, and then bring it down here. Good thinking, Brighton. That just might work. At least his brain is still working. Oh, 99%. 99. Brighton's idea worked. His oxygen level is at 99%. If he wants to complete this challenge, Haha I'm not an idiot. Hey, 99%. That's good. So I can stand in here longer? Frick It's kind of true. Obviously I want to be but it does suck. It's terrible. But I'm doing it because I want to prove myself Good luck. I'm so glad that I did the research Don't use any air compressor because you get carbon monoxide poisoned. Brighton, this is your dad. Can you hear me? Hello How are you feeling? I feel fine. We're flying to California now. Without me. Be safe, okay? Okay, I will. I love you. I love you too. Have a safe flight. Eight hour update. I'm still alive, still kicking. I'm not feeling too sick, which is good. By this time, and so I think I've done good I feel a little less but I think we're gonna be able to do this. Cole Bryton wants you to come in the bucket! We got a new guest in the tub. What's up, Cole? What's up. How's it going? There's a creeper outside. I can smell you. I'm getting really tired.
