*Whapoosh!* Top of the mornin' to ya laddies! My name is Jacksepticeye, and welcome to a game called Night in the Woods. Now, I'm just gonna say this right now, I have absolutely no idea what this game is about. I did see that it came out on Steam recently; It's brand new, But I just kind of glanced over it and didn't pass any remarks to it. But a lot of people have been asking me to play this I can't remember what I uploaded recently Might have been... Valhallah? That I uploaded But people really wanted to see me play this And it's had a lot of really good buzz around it And the more I kinda looked into it The more praise I have been seeing from people around it... So... And I... I mean I got a LOT of requests to play this So I'm really interested in it! I... I wanna know now what the big fuss is all about um... Why does it say &quot;if&quot; right beside Night In The Woods? I don't know... And I think the game got Kickstarted as well But... Don't quote me on that; I- I'm not sure So... Let's start game... I don't even know what type of game it is I know it's 2D and the art style looks really nice Have something in my eye... That's the problem with really long eyelashes You get... They all stick together... Oh. (Reading) In the year granddad died... - Ohhh... (Reading) ...We had the worst flood since 1998. Gregg got trapped on top of a dog house. The power was out for two days. Casey Hartley came by in his dad's boat And I laughed when I saw him. Granddad left me an apple crate of books He loved ghost stories And quoted them to (find) himself in the hospital bed . . . Hm.. (Reading) ... &quot;They went looking for the gods and died in lonely places.&quot; *Clears throat* (Reading) ...On his last day he sat up suddenly and stared bug-eyed through the window. . . . (Reading) At the old trains rattling to somewhere else from somewhere else. He turned to my dad Eyes still wide &quot;This house is haunted,&quot; he said and died. Wow... What a way to start things off. That was spooky... I like that! Not that the game is actually spooky... Um... And I don't know why but it rem--- It reminded me of Oxenfree when I looked up the game. That train is not even on any tracks! Um... Ok.. I don't know what voice to give you... Uh... 'Cause you're probably gonna talk a lot so that's probably the voice I'm gonna have to say the most MAE: *High pitched voice* Well, this is great MAE: I mean I didn't expect a party or anything MAE: But I figured *Someone* would be here, MAE: Welcome home Mae. Oh... Ok... MAE: Wow. When did they put this up? MAE: Possum spring has never looked more... MAE: ... Falsely advertised (Chuckles) You're cheerful. MAE: It must be such a relief to payphone companies that Possum Springs gets MAE: zero cell reception. MAE: It'd be cool to call my parents MAE: But some jerkhole took the time to actually rip it off. MAE: Who steals a phone? Uh... The Great Phone Stealer. MAE: Fiasco Fox you are too dreamy... (Laughs) Aww... Okay... I like this already! GARBO AND MALLOY!!! MALLOY: Welcome back to Garbo and Malloy! GARBO: What's in the news today, Malloy? MALLOY: Markets were up today!

MALLOY: The economy added 15.000 jobs MALLOY: Mostly in the chart sector GARBO: Which is notoriously recession proof! (In voice) Or should I say recession WOOF! MALLOY: My my, Garbo, we've got a little political here! GARBO: Gotta get political every now and then (Laughs) What the fuck? Okay... Hello, sir! Nice beard. Can birds grow beards? Birds, beards... MAE: Excuse me, but where is everybody? REPAIR MAN: It's 10:45. It's closed. REPAIR MAN: Not a lot of folks getting off the last bus to Possum Springs these days. REPAIR MAN: Just you. Oh. Ooh! Dialog options. &quot;So are you the janitor or something?...&quot; &quot;Isn't there supposed to be someone at the desk?...&quot; Yeah, this one. REPAIR MAN: Closed. MAE: Why are the lights on? Why is the TV on? REPAIR MAN: I get spooked when I'm here by my lonesome. MAE: Oh. Well - Thanks. Can I leave? An - Can I get past you? C'mon dude! MAE: Uh... can I squeeze past you? REPAIR MAN: Nope. Just broke the damn thing. MAE: When do you think it might be done? REPAIR MAN: Right after you go and grab me a Fiascola from the machine. MAE: Am I paying for this? REPAIR MAN: I always rig it when I'm here after hours. MAE: Nice. Free as in free? REPAIR MAN: Free as in no one's here to say otherwise. Okay! Cool. A free, foxy Fiascola coming right up! MAE: What the? MAE: They have Lime Fiasco and he wants a Fiascola? MAE: That's just a waste. (Laughs) Don't judge a man's... ...beverage needs! Cola is a good, safe choice. MAE: Okay, just gotta grab it. Oh...! I actually had to do that! Alrighty... I like the shirt as well... NO MEANS NO! MAE: Here you go. MAE: One FREEASSCOLA. Oh... Free-ass-cola instead of Fiascola. (Laughs) Nice one dude...! REPAIR MAN: Yummers. REPAIR MAN: So what are you doing here? MAE: I live here. MAE: Well, Lived here. REPAIR MAN: Huh. Strange. MAE: When do you think that door's gonna be finished? REPAIR MAN: Now. REPAIR MAN: Goodbye. (Laughs) MAE: Uh. Bye. (Laughs Again) Man, this game is charming! I really like this! *Clears Throat* Art style is very, very nice - *Clears Throat Again* Excuse me. &quot;BUS STAT?&quot; MAE: I'm not walking back out to the highway. MAE: Probably get hit by a car or something. MAE: Hey where did that janitor go? MAE: Did he walk? Probably. You don't know... MAE: Well I'm right outside town. MAE: Mom and dad nowhere to be found. MAE: Dark and cold. MAE: Guess I'm walking. MAE: Alone. (Laughs) MAE: This bus station is maybe the newest thing in Possum Springs. MAE: Guess they got state funding or something. MAE: It makes a good first or last impression I suppose. MAE: If not for the abandoned glass factory back there. MAE: Not getting rid of that anytime soon. This is neat. MAE: Wow. MAE: I didn't realize how much I missed the sound of that train. MAE: I used to hear it in my bed at night MAE: During the winter when the leaves were down. That's cool! Man, it's pretty! MAE: Well, I guess I'm gonna hike through the woods. MAE: Through the woods is home. MAE: My bed. MAE: And my negligent parents. (Laughs) Oh... Nice! Please tell me the rest of the game is gonna keep up this humor, cause that's awesome! (Laughs) Okay... This is a little drearier than I thought. MAE: Ugh. This is some dark - dank nature. MAE: Dank nature and garbage. Fucking - 420 blaze it Ugh... All wet and gross. MAE: There used to be an old sawmill around here I think. MAE: I mean the park up there's called Sawmill Park. MAE: Looks like they lost a log load at some point. MAE: *Sigh* MAE: Gonna have to climb this I guess. Man, yeah your parents fucking suck... Well, it is called &quot;Night In The Woods.&quot; Ooh... Can I break this or something? OH, JESUS!!! Oh, my bad! You okay? MAE: Oh my God. MAE: That was dangerous! MAE: I could have died! MAE: THAT WAS AMAZING! (Laughs) I love this little dude. MAE: I am not gonna die in this hole. See, I want to give individual voices to all the characters, cause I love doing that... But when it's the main character it's kinda hard to do a voice that's just non stop so... I usually just kinda default back to my own voice. Nice. Ey... What is those lights over there? Who wrote Murf On this tree? Who wrote love Retweets? (Laughs) Kinda reminds me of Limbo in a way MAE: Wow. I haven't been here in maybe 10 years. MAE: And apparently no one else has. Where have you been? Aw the music's cool. MAE: I don't know what they were going for here. MAE: Some sort of boat castle? MAE: Most of it's gone now. MAE: Just a thing for weird animals to eat and have babies in. (Laughs) Aw, I like this character. Ooh...! Can I get up? Oh, yeah! MAE: AHOY! You don't do anything else? I wanna sail the ship. MAE: Looks like the ladder's gone. MAE: If I could just get to the top of this thing... MAE: Ugh. Hup! Fear not! Hup! Aw, man! Thought I could do that... Oh...! She said... It said I wonder what kind of animals and dirt possu - er, have babies in here? MAE: Dirt possums. Night snakes. Mystery beasts of all shapes. Probably... Okay... Maybe I can do this then? Kinda looks like I can get up there, but not really. Hmm... HA!!! No. Maybe I need something else! Imma look around. MAE: Oh come on. MAE: Don't think I have the upper body strength to climb this... Okay... I guess I do need something else. Can I pick up anything? MAE: I remember Cathy Daminco's boyfriend took her here. MAE: To make out and then break up. MAE: And the next day Cathy pulled out Cindy Clark's nosering MAE: At the Fort Lucenne mall. MAE: This entire area is so full of romance. (Laughs) Okay... So... How do I get up here? These things have 2 and 3 on them MAE: Hey! You can still see Mr. Snorkles on this! Who wrote mr. Snorkles? MAE: I DEFINITELY remember barely reaching the top of this wheel. MAE: I definitely remember barely growing since then *Laughing* Aw... Poor you I wanna mess with this wheel YEAH Okay. So I can do that but I can't get any further. Hello? Unless there is like other buttons that I'm not aware of That do things Nope... Ha... Man... Fuckin' work AAHH... There we go! So... They said that you just gotta keep running and the third jump was... bigger And said physics or something Aw Cool... Also I know that the character *Cough* Is probably a girl An... But I'm not giving it the voice that suits that I apologize Again There's a lot of...There's a lot of dialog MAE: It's only been 2 years since I lived here. MAE: Not in this playground, Possum springs I mean. MAE: This is all getting jumbled. I should write it down. Aww... R.I.P. Granddad Your parents forgot you! *Laughing* Okay... Can I go back?

The characters and the writing are just awesome! It doesn't feel like I've recording for an hour It feels so short. Wake up Mae! Time to start today! And I love this type of games. I love the type of... like a umm... I dunno. What will I call this? IDK it's like Life Is Strange kind of games, in a way. Kinda reminds me Undertale. And reminds me a lot of games. But I really like it. It's mainly for the dialogue along. The dialogue and the... ...the art style are really really good. I really like them so far. And I really like- the charactors that showing up, and- I don't know the story is so far Just since I'm back. I did something years ago, maybe killed someone? Possibly by accident? And somebody else lost some arm But since back with my friends, had a lot of fun by them. Umm. Let me know what you guys think Uhh. I have- have to dig up my repertoire of voices and keep it going. Think of the voice I gave some of them may be good. IDK but the voice I gave to Mae. Cause she, she always um... talks like this. But it's an easy voice to do. IDK. Anyway! Thank you guys so much for watching this episode. If you liked it, PUNCH the like button in the face. LIKE A BOSS!
