I'm scared. We have to stay lucid. We're going to kill ourselves. Move fast, move fast! Hurry up! Go, go, go! Everest... The highest It's located in the Himalayas, It's a legendary peak that has And venturing to such extreme altitudes means taking big risks. There are huge crevasses... and a freezing cold... that can claim your limbs. There are avalanches... and of course, there is the altitude. The higher you go... the more your body wastes away. Beyond 7500 meters... is what we call the "Death Zone." And if you risk pulmonary edema... and swelling of the brain... and you could lose your sight. In the Death Zone, There is no rescue... no helicopter... and it's almost impossible And despite that... more than a century ago... expeditions set out to reach the but to no avail. In 1953... Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary reach the I've always been impressed I think it comes from the mangas I started reading as a child. They're always who has... impossible dreams! And somehow, But at the time... the only way for me was through video games. Let's go on an adventure! Actually, Minecraft... is a game You meet up with your friends and All right, we did it, guys! Soon afterwards, I wanted to share them, Here we are for my my name is Inoxtag. I did it. Thanks to everyone who has been There are 100,000 of us. So, I thought, why not do it for real? I really challenged myself. Today, I created concepts. A deadly For example, 48 hours to We all played so I thought, This village We're going to spend And more and more of you YouTube allowed me And a year ago... I decided to embark on a He made a big He announced that he It's the highest He comes off After the announcement, I go online and see that I got many messages of support! But I was insulted as well. Well, it disrupts the environment But what's left then? Is it just so But no! You violated Everest! I mean, And I understand these people. I'm not from that background... But then I think, why not try? If I'm not ready, At worst I fail... but at least I learned something. Though, I will have to change. Because at that moment, Welcome to my home. Or I guess, the bathroom! Honestly, it's embarrassing. I had to move, I came over here, I said: "It's fine, "It won't be for long anyway, Fast forward, and I've Living in There are flags outside as well. Look, I'll show you how it goes. I finish my live at 2 in the and I'm exhausted. I open the door, like that. I take off my socks, I brush my teeth, and "ciao." I sleep... then I wake up... The wardrobe is empty... so I go in the bathtub... I put on some shorts... I go walk the dog, And that's it! Bro, I don't really live here! I just come... drop off my stuff, and take off the next day! Come on, let's go! Well, my lifestyle is catastrophic. I sleep badly... I'm jetlagged... I eat badly, I don't pay attention... and physically? Forget about it. When he announced the project... Okay, what's our pace? Uh, really slow. He never played So, it's a quality that he... he never developed. Do you... He's walking! This is what I call jogging! I thought I looked impressive, -I'm not doing anything! All right. -What's your BPM now? The amount of to reach a goal like that in one Some people will take... 5 years to reach So, I was definitely uneasy. That's why I had to intensive program for him. It would allow him to reach his I don't feel so good. I thought my heart I was already dead at the end, and when you said, Man... It was horrible. That's the shitty part. That's... the real shitty part. All the red is filming. That schedule's crazy. With all those videos... people, people are going to say, "Either he's changing his life, or he's making videos. I don't get it, because he's You said you would be willing Well, we've where we're going to have to cut video production in half, Remove one out of every two limit it to two videos a month instead. So, we go from... four videos per month... to two videos per month. The training had to be arranged A good, fairly solid workout... One which wouldn't Idriss was essential for but someone was missing But I didn't know anyone, so I called Nico Mathieu, And he told Mathis is a mountain guide. He's also a photographer He's the new generation of He's done so much. When I heard about the I said to myself... "Wow, the guy's a YouTuber I admit that at the time, apprehensive about the project. I thought, "This guy, uh... He wants to take He wants to be well known... Uh... Is he doing it The right motivations?" But I still wanted to meet him. So, I told him for three weeks, so he could Then we'd see what we could do. Grab it with your hand, and go back. -Grab it with my hand... Then I get my hand and slide Exactly. But look, you really I mean, If you fall, I'll end up dead! I'm going to have to I know I won't fall, you know? Let's see if he knows I'm going to tie a figure eight So far, not great. Don't you have Aw damn, I messed up. Stupid figure eight knot! Can I go up with this? Yeah, you can. After... Good luck, I'll give you a tip. Make a simple figure 8 knot, Okay. Now I got it. So, just follow the rope. My first real knot! Yes. Keep going... You have you're still raising There you go, that's better. That was scary! Remember to lower your heels, Should I give him a little rope? Yeah, he's acting smug. Easy! Whoa! You bastard! I almost had a heart attack! -Let's do this. It's my first time and to be honest, Everything went In fact, he brought along Leo No pressure, it was just It looks Honestly, it looks unclimbable. Uh, Inox? Okay. -Shit! What the... The descender just fell! -You guys are crazy! Dammit, I'm an idiot. I can't go back down. Hey, Mathis? What do I do Don't worry, Wow, that drop is crazy. Well done, bro. -Yeah, but I'm an idiot! Dropping the descender You have to be careful. Dammit... Because of me, There are techniques you but they're annoying. It's a pain without one. Dammit, I'm so stupid. No biggie. It could be worse. It's a mistake I -I'll never do that again. What I like about Mathis, is that he introduced Welcome to the Mountains. Look at that! It's incredible! But it's kinda scary in -It's thousands of meters. So... If we fall, we're dead. Okay. Well, isn't that reassuring If we fall on either side, -We'd be dead, right? Uh, we'll be close to that it's just below. Seracs that are and they But there are times when and whether you're... Kilian Jornet, Nims Dai, or... some guy from Paris who's doing everyone takes the same risk. Damn, that's crazy, huh? You go... It could fall on you. It happens randomly. We're here to minimize the risk, you'll be crushed. -Whoa, dude! What a pain in the butt! He's already salty, I just arrived and he's salty! Jeez! Come on, dude, damn! Bro, I mean, come on! Imagine, "Dude, -I'm gonna become a mountaineer! I felt like they the true art of mountaineering. It's an art, it's... And they're open to do things well... and to really I'm really pleasantly surprised, He picks up all the mountaineering and he's really improved his crampon techniques... so that's great. I kicked and moved, I saw you, you were After spending I agreed to Although, we still don't know... how his body We haven't gone When you and don't know if your you may not even be And Everest? Forget about it! For the moment, how his body will So, it's imperative that he So, today is test day. It's the hypoxia test. It will resistance to a lack of oxygen. The higher you go, the less This is one of the... best indicators to know And, unfortunately, it's something that If you don't test well... It's over. So long, adventure. So, then... even if I work hard and that's it, You'd be screwed. It's over. Begin! So, then you came back down, Now, we're going to and push you to the maximum. Show your true level? That's it, use your rage! Go for it! That's it, keep going! You're good, Go! You got this! Don't stop, don't stop! So, Ines... your heart just accelerated and you reached a VO2 max... of, uh, 51.7. Which means... you may be more comfortable but at very high altitudes, it's not necessarily And what would be an advantage An advantage would be a good in other words... good chemoreceptors, during the first phase. Here you go... So, as you can see, the results are listed right which will allow your tolerance to high altitudes. Okay. So, you got a 3 and 5, So, you're good in either case. However, you should know that There's the altitude, there's the risk of avalanches, Yeah, there are lots of the level of danger associated Right. Now that he's passed the test... we're going to get We're going to go up there?! Are you trying to kill me?! No... at least, not yet. This rock is scary, bro Why's that? What scares you? It's so steep! And it's huge! Come on! You're doing good, bro. Come on... mind over matter... Look at that... -It must be, like, 4,000 meters! I've never been so It's good for you! You wanted No, but more of a... beginner level, you know? -Bro... I... -No, never. First time for us both! -Are you kidding me? You've never done it? No, never! Oh, man, this guy is crazy! He's never climbed it, Yo dude, Did you Yeah, I see it... It's pretty steep. It's hard now, Yes. We'll grab a big burger when we get down. If we're still alive. You got this, bro. Come on. We did it. I'm happy with you. That's good, you did well. We did it... Thank you, Mathis. Congratulations. I'm proud of you, bro. Thanks, bro. You truly outdid yourself. Now this part's really scary. -My leg is shaking by itself. Okay... okay... stay calm... Stay calm, Ines! Stay calm. Holy shit, bro! Oh my God! I'm telling you... that summit was the worst. It was the worst. Well, I told you... this summer will be busy. Mont Blanc, Let's go! Don't go into the red. I'm following you. I can't believe my eyes. It's Pack your things, Are you telling me that we're In Switzerland with the Swiss! -Can you see from here? What a monster! The mountain... is terrifying! I took Amine -"Toubkal." It's the 4200 meters! The goal is not to complain. I'm not going to stop. Are you sleeping? Let's go! Then, who suggested I Cross Corsica on the trail. This is the start of the GR20. 5 days of walking with Nico, As for Everest, mentally, there's nothing better And we continue... We continue... and we don't stop. He's running now, Chill, it's all good. We did so much... and my mom even joined us. -Are you getting tired, Mom? but I would get tired when -Because of the computer? When I was 13. He wanted to spend Go in the bush behind you! Now, You got it. When did When my mom got a PC, and I think she No. No, but I to where you are now, outside in nature. I have no regrets, because finally... you've discovered life. It's amazing. Amazing! It's incredible up here! Is this the end? Hey, look at this! The summit! Let's go! Thank you, Mathis. You made my life beautiful. But seriously, I've discovered a In recent years, I haven't so, I, uh... decided to give my mother a gift. This is our destination. No, no way. You wanted to fly, -Shall we go over then? How beautiful, thank you! Mathis, did you wake up one day and say to yourself, "I'm gonna Why did "I think... that I'm, Well, in the beginning... when you and I met, Okay, this guy doesn't just want discover the mountain. So, basically... I said to myself... okay, the project is cool... because you actually wanted and because you than just reaching So, I think that you agreed to take... to me, it's the right approach. And I'm... really happy with the but this is only the We've done some of the highest so now, we have to heading to Nepal. The hardest part is yet to come? Ama Dablam. 6,812 meters. It's considered by many to be the most beautiful For our body to withstand it will have to acclimatize So, we're going to do a 10-day going from village to village, to adjust to the altitude... and thus reach the base camp, where we will leave without the help of oxygen tanks. Ines has only 6 and the challenge is immense. We depart tomorrow! Are you ready? We depart tomorrow, but... You know what? Yesterday, I went to a restaurant My dad's really worried. -Oh, yeah? And he gave me a I thought to myself, Because... if one day I'm in trouble, or lacking He told me, uh...

But enough is enough, I just want If this experience... hadn't changed me... mentally... I would have reached the top, and like the other projects, "Okay, I made it, now what?" It's the worst failure. For sure, I'm a new man. You can compare, uh... the Ines from the beginning... when the project was announced... to the one at the end, Whether it's because of If I don't change, it'll just be the catalog, At the moment, he's doing Between his life as a It was making me dizzy! "You have to make a choice. You can't do all at once and Either you focus or you focus on your projects." I'm sending a voice I don't know what's going on, it's really starting This isn't the time to be stupid. You're sabotaging all the It's time for you to refocus. To put everything into Even if it's hard, with I don't know what, So, what I'm asking you to do... is to eliminate That's your only priority, That's your job right now. It's time to wake up. It's not possible. It hasn't been a year already, The 6 months between it couldn't have Here we go, guys. You know, time is so insane! -One year. Climbing Everest but the Instead of taking my phone, No one in the studio believes me. -You're really leaving it? I'm leaving it. You're not taking a phone? I'm not taking it. It's okay! I'll focus on the objective! Take it and turn it off. No! Stop telling me to take it! Mathis didn't believe me, and that it's just I don't have my I just tried I already reached for it! Well, say bye to the studio! The time has come. Man, it's so crazy! One year. It's the big day. Bro, here we go! And so, we're off for a I'm not feeling great. Dammit, I'm getting sick again... But it's normal, We're getting acclimated, I know my body. 24 hours. I could have all the diseases in and I'd still go up. Mathis! Yeah, bro? Base camp's in sight! It's like a city! Yeah, I guess. It's not bad... it's not that big. I think it's huge! -Base camp. I promised, I'll see you Promise kept. -You never gave up. One year. One year, dude. Do you regret it? Not for a second. Dude, I feel so good, I'm happy. Thanks for coming with me, You're welcome, bro. Dude! Our camp is awesome! I'm so happy! Ila Nuru! -Hey, Manish! Ah! Are you good?! Come on, bro! Good job! We're not acclimatized just yet. -Manish? Are you a fan of basketball? Yeah! I'm, I'm a huge fan, Were you on a team? Yeah... I represented Nepal in Rimini, Italy. -Dude, he's an ex-pro. Yeah, For the summit, The guy is ready to go. Let's do it for Kobe. I have a surprise for him, but he It's a surprise. Manish... Right now, of Sagarmatha, of Everest. -We have the same dream, brother. I made a promise to Manish, because he wanted to summit He had to stop at Camp 4, because his for him to climb He told him, "Stay at Camp 4, I promised him The whole team will... Let's go! There will be enough We have Sunam here. He'll be You're from Longtang Valley? His whole village... his house totally Your whole house? He stopped help his family and... to rebuild their house. When I was taking the guide exam, we did an exchange He was gonna go. and Sunam but he couldn't because rebuild their house and village. Damn, man. It was important and keep my family safe. And after, We're because you guys are... a lot better than There are some clients who don't Damn. There's was even somebody where we -What? I don't believe you. And sometimes, like, and he says, "Oh, I can't even pee." No! No, I don't buy it! I don't buy it... -No way, really? The client was an old man, okay, okay. Come on. He had to hold his penis so he could pee. Bro, that's so disgusting. So, I guess... Tendi! Pathan! Milan! Sama! On an expedition like this, we can't carry So, these Nepalese porters And then, they come back down, So, uh... if we reach the summit, it's partly they're machines. You are the best, bro! In the comments... Power to them, brothers! They're Heads up! Do you think No. Whoa, Ines! He's just a we're gonna do this. It looks impossible. It's not possible It's too big! Climbing Everest is a whole other level compared We'll have to go with big We'll start with the Icefall, one of the most We're crossing a glacier that can give way at any moment. After Camp 1, we'll go around huge crevasses a valley exposed to the sun where temperatures can After Camp 2, we'll have to face the steep slope of and then Camp 4. That will be when we Beyond that attitude, we'll start to die. It's in these extreme conditions that we must attempt the On a dizzying ridge with Prepare your mind for... I don't have that thing where I don't have that thing where... Well... you have to... have confidence, and... continue to focus on the prep It'll all work out. Louis... will be filming with Manish. He did Everest last year... therefore, How long About 10 hours. -That's a lot. I mean... It's up the Matterhorn and back. Camp 4 to the summit... is just as far. We'll stay so we can acclimatize. And then, when the weather is It only happens once a year, Well... I'll show you where Welcome to base camp! It's a mini city, just below Everest, and it's really grown There are a lot of problems, like and overpopulation... For now, But I think that up there... It'll be worse, But as Mathis taught me, as it was before you arrived. So, we'll bring our so we don't leave And in the meantime... we'll wait at our camp. Welcome to my home! Welcome to my home! Welcome to my home! Well, this is my room This is where I sleep every night with a beautiful and I have a duvet in it -Wait, let me clean this up. That's disgusting! It's my pee. I managed That's my record At night when you get up to pee, because you have you can't be bothered to so you grab a bottle, You know what I mean? I have to empty That's disgusting. My Air Up you have So here, I have my toiletry bag, this my mouthwash and my and my skincare routine. I didn't do that in Paris. I put on this moisturizing because the sun If you put this on your face... you'll do to the summit. Sure! Summit... Summit! Nice! Nice! Well, you must be wondering because at night, but... what about daytime? Anyone there? it falls into a blue canister... and as soon as it's full, and they take it to the valley, at the base of the mountain. Hey Mathis! Ah! Jeez, dude! -because it's kind of a mess. I'm out of breath now. Bro! I'm out of breath. He should have Goddamn! He's Without any training... he came to the base camp to film. Hey, look who's there. Oh my god! Oh, his feet! His feet! Oh, What is this music, bro? Manish, I'm not acclimatized yet. I have no more energy, over there is the kitchen. The cook has been so it's our turn to treat him! French cheese! Okay! -Okay, let's go! Petite Tomme de Savois. It's my favorite cheese! This cheese made Goddamn. No way! -That really stinks! Ah! I'm going to throw up, bro! Wait, hold on! Okay, you guys... it got a little warm, but... it doesn't look too bad. Oh, man... Oh my god! This is absolutely Is it good or not? Yeah, it's good, good! Oh my god! That's France! -You like it? Is it good or not? Yes, yes! It's good! I'm on fire! We can discuss I pray to and without injuries or problems. So, we... will try to summit uh, the 18th? Oh, but that's 3 days away! The weather will be very good. If you think the then for me, it's not a problem. Tonight, all -To drop off... the oxygen. What do you think about the... I think there will be... -Okay. Is the plan okay? Yeah. Good? Thank you, Sonam, It's good man, the -One year! Now it's down to 3 days, man! I'm going to call and say that the the 18th. What do you think? Because I I don't know if it's a good The 18th has From afternoon to evening, wind and fog at all altitudes. I'm not climbing If you're all the way up there, The only other thing As for the fog... They're saying fog, but I I'm more afraid of the traffic, Man, that's my phobia as well. Well, it's coming up fast, to be the voice that's... I don't He doesn't want anything. He doesn't want fog, Going to Everest is a I'm not going to the top of You shouldn't place or you'll never go up! You shouldn't think, "Oh, there's going to be wind, oh, there's going to be fog, Otherwise, you'll... you'll go in three years! I don't have enough experience I'm placing my There are 400 of waiting for a That's how the just like the photos, everything we've seen on social with the really long lines... There's a window of So, all the climbers are That's why we're to find I admit, We're going to need because up there, there isn't much Dude, -For sure. We need to test the oxygen So, -No, it's not on yet. It's good. What the fuck? Is there -Oh, yeah. Like you're hungry? Yeah! What the fuck, man?! But dude, you feel it right away! Do you see the Well, I've never tried it, Then wait, try it, try it! Don't you feel like No, it's not giving me chills. -But don't you feel good now? -Oh yeah, so much better! It makes a major difference! Damn it's heavy. But dude, having this on It would last 5 hours. Having oxygen is a major asset. Some come without it, and they should be doing Without oxygen is a hundred times For real, a hundred times harder. Whoa, dude! I thought it was a helicopter! Not a helicopter, an avalanche! Looked at that, it's huge! But man, the Damn there's more. It's moving. The seracs are breaking. We just have to be sure not to It's better so tomorrow will be okay! Mathis gave me this mask. When it gets really cold, your throat might burn with If you use the mask, to keep the humidity I don't want to hurt my throat, so I'll go Tomorrow... That's right... Damn, man... Dude, I'm a little scared. I admit that... since we're hearing it's a little stressful, but... it'll be fine, I know it will. Hey old man! How are you doing? Bro, I miss you! So... Yeah, long time no see, Have you done any research yet? Man, I left my phone in Paris Mathis gave me his The best thing and just focus on Everest. I'm going tomorrow, bro! Oh, that's crazy! 4 days. It's tomorrow man! It's, it's tomorrow! Bro, give What you're doing right now is Aw, man I... Shonen Spirit all the way. Remember, Ines did really well. We've and he really put his all for this project. A year of preparation may seem pretty short, but Ines was so dedicated, He gave it his all for 360 days. It was all he thought about, whether he That's the same as 5-6 years of preparation. You know, I'm so happy. Dude... it's a year of mountain climbing. He knows how to climb well, he's comfortable with the he knows how to attach, That guarantees I'm so stressed, man. I admit that my stomach It'll be fine. I hope it'll be fine. Staying safe is the real goal... and getting back alive. You're crazy to follow me here... because I like to take risks. Yeah, you take risks, It's a lot of factors combined, which is why Well, Ines had an impact on me. His way of being, his energy... Honestly, he's super inspiring. We did it, brother! We've both grown I'm so happy to be Before we start climbing, who supported me everyone who encouraged me, "Good luck with Everest." I've been hearing that -Good luck with Everest. -To the summit! Even that guy's encouraging me. Before going up, My whole team who Thanks also to the criticizers. It allowed me to about many things... and become even better. So, Yeah... I should be. -Well, be careful, okay, son? Remember, and I'm here to hold you down. In case, uh... something happens... just know that... I had the best life ever. How are you? -And you? -I have good news. -I have good news. I'm leaving tonight. -Oh, it's time! Tonight? Oh, that's great! -My goodness. I wanted to tell That's wonderful, sweetheart. I'll be rooting for you. Now, it's gonna be... Actually, I don't know I don't if it's... I have no idea. -I honestly have no idea. You know, you shouldn't just take things as they come. Don't try to figure out You'll feel what you need to Go forward, and observe, Think of me on the 19th... I'll be suffering. I think of you every day. Every single day. Big kiss, Mom. All right, let's do this. It's time to get going. It's finally time... No matter what happens... no regrets, man. No regrets. The Icefall. This is one of the most An unstable glacier that With huge blocks of ice that can collapse at any moment. We're going to have to to reach the first camp Look at that, bro! It's like a building! If that falls on your face, When you go under it... you can't hang around! Expose yourself Go ahead, From this point on, we're going to start because there are Holy shit! Dude, that's 30 meters! Dude why is the drop so crazy?! Oh my god! Come here... give me your hand. Oh my god, oh my god! That was so terrifying, bro! You have to put Okay. So, toes forward. Point your toes forward. Nice, Sonam! Nice, brother! This passage has Use the front spikes... Okay, front spikes... Look at the people. Wait, where? What?! What the hell?! It's mind-blowing. I didn't think it would be Dude, I sure hope not. It's like what we saw on Now we're living it. It's because You really have to pull a lot... so it takes a time, it's backed up. We're going -a good hour. At least we're towards the front. It must be even worse behind us! Oh my god, man! Oh my god! But dude, what the hell is this! -It's hell. It's like the Or a movie where It's hell on Earth. There's a serac right above us. -Yeah. Don't worry, I saw it. I'd rather not look at it either! Especially since there's at any moment under Sonam's feet, Mathis is stunned. I've only been but Mathis is a pro, If the guys were prepared... if they had the skills... Yeah! -it'd go by quick! Yeah! But they don't even know how No, these They don't know how so it's taking forever. That's the problem. Dude, how long have We've been under and it could fall at any moment! Exactly. Well, if it does breaks, Sonam, -No? It's always like this? I got us into a mess, Yeah, well... Maybe we were in You think we'll I hope so. Yeah, me too. But there are so many people... I'm telling you... I don't wanna lose any fingers, Me neither. We've been walking for 6 hours. We're finally at Camp 1. Camp 1! The first step is done. So, I'm... at Camp 1. Three more to go. Are you tired? I wanna go to sleep. Did you tap into No, not yet, So, we're here... And now... we're inflating these, so... Look there. That's the top of Everest. I'm inflating my mattress... with a view of the top of Honestly, Camp 1 isn't Yeah. Especially since... Dude, Well, we're on huge holes. So, I've never seen holes like that. At any moment... a hole could open up! Dude, they're actually canyons. Bro, they're canyons! Tomorrow we're going to Camp 2. It should take us a less time. To get to Camp 2? 2 or 3 hours. I was woken I didn't sleep at all. This is a real mess! Mathis told me that Manish! -Yeah! How are you doing, brother? I'm vomiting. -What are you gonna do? So, are you coming with us, -I'm going with you. Yeah. If you need to recover... Let's go to Camp 2. Time for Camp 2. It's not easy. Yeah, bro! Dude, it's... Goddamn... It took it out of us today, And if we Yeah, mentally it's... Damn, Mentally, this is torture. Mentally, this is torture. I've already suffered so much, It's a slap in the face. Once you get over 6000, It's honestly This place How is Manish? He has... altitude sickness, Is he on oxygen? -How's his oxygen? Hey, brother. Yeah. -Okay? Get well! -Get well, brother! -I'm sure you'll get better. I hope so. Manish isn't well. We're Tomorrow morning, if his body is okay and fine... then we'll take off. If not... -No summit? Damn, that's so annoying. If he's really sick... -we can't risk it. But I wanted to do I'm so, so tired. Let's hope tomorrow is better. But it's crazy because... I don't know if I can make it. It's so far away, that... I keep thinking... of how much needs to be done... I keep thinking... Can I really do this? Especially after It's not easy, it's not easy. This isn't the place for us... We're here at 6400 meters... and everything yet to come I'm scared man. -Guys, I think we have a problem. The weather has changed. And uh... basically, for the 20th... it was still good. But now, on the 20th, -It's bad. -Bro... they're doing the 19th. Do we go up then? Now? Man, that's not even an option. Bro, given the number of people Look, you guys, I'm telling... the traffic up there is than the wind. I think going now What do you think? You want to go now? So, we decided, that with the 20th is the best. I agree. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. It will all be the same. All right? I here... in Camp 2 after a shitty night. Bring on the sun. We're waiting because there's only Once the sun is out, -It was pretty noisy last night. At one point... The wind... There's a crazy Last night, uh... about ten tents were blown away. We were lucky, but we slept badly because it was As we've the weather is always a factor... It can affect the, It can cause the journey to fail, have an impact on our expedition. So, when... the weather is nicer, For now, we're Right now, with our own fucking beds Oh, my god! Yeah, it's true... you start We're two idiots in a tent. Two idiots in a tent. And what has the morning -I'm doing good! The comeback is real. It's real, bro! Right? Yeah. My bro. Manish is making -I'm back! Hey, Manish? Last night you sure You were like... "Good night, bro!" How are you, Charles? Charles is also climbing Everest, A little before 11am... uh, this morning... at the top of the climb... of the mountain... my stomach got so bloated... I was sure I was going I took five steps... and then rested for ten seconds. Then I took five steps, Dude... So, you managed not to shit I got here, I drink the tea. I finish the tea, man, Man, I said to him: I need a toilet! Quick, it's a toilet emergency! Man, so they point out the little That's the toilet? That's just for pee, right? Man... I went in there, dude. So, I'm squatting, and my You know, I'm, I'm like this... and it's not enough, I'm not So, he pooped on the rock! It was really coming out, man. -Did you shit on yourself? The tent... It was covered in shit! Man, I ruined that tent. The tent was... The guys... they... they just finished setting it up! And I get to the base camp... They just finished setting it up! And I ruined that tent. 5 minutes after it was set up. Man... so after that... what could I do? I was in there for an hour, man. I had to clean everything up. No, that story is too crazy. I can imagine him in there Man, he set off a bomb! Man, this guy is too much... He's too much. That's it, the wind has That's the oxygen tank. We're not gonna use it now, The tank is all set. Ready? We'll be covering 700 meters of to get to get to Camp 3. Camp 3, tomorrow morning. Camp 4, tomorrow evening. Then the summit! Tomorrow evening, Summit time, bro. Man! It's tomorrow! -The summit! Tomorrow night! Now I'm thinking I can do Camp 3. After that, who knows!a But we'll find out! In any case, If you're not okay at Camp 3, it's too bad. Once you get to It's not gonna be easy... but that's why I'm here. That's exactly why I'm here. -It's our turn to play now. We're not slowing down anymore. This is the final stretch. I got butterflies in my stomach. There's Here we go! We're climbing Everest. This is just the beginning! And... it's already hard. Go slowly... and we'll make the summit. If we run like a rabbit, -No summit. Be a turtle. I'm trying not Each step An avalanche! It's okay on our side, There's a We're going to put on the We have to hurry, because in the afternoon, Okay! Oxygen on! Now I feel it, man. Well, from now on... I'll be wearing for the 48 hours. Holy shit! This stuff is so crazy! Don't get too close, Take a real big jump. Camp 3! The good news is, The bad news is, Goddamn. We can officially say that We passed the 7000-mark, bro. We're at 7000! Our next step is 8000... I don't even know how I got here. I... I don't know. Last night, there were and there was a lot A lot of people turned back, that won't be our case. The problem is that now, more people will be because so many people turned So, I guess... we'll see what happens. Are you good? How are you, man? -I'm tired. Holy shit, we are, bro! We've been wearing oxygen and and now, we're here. This entire year... has been Tomorrow and the day after Now, I'm getting scared. We're waking up at camp 3. It's the big wakeup call! It's pretty windy right now. It's gonna We can rest a little and then head to the summit. What's going on? 2 oxygen tanks have disappeared. Wait, where are the tanks? They Yeah, yes, during the night. We had 2 oxygen tanks stolen! They stole two of our tanks?! Yeah, two tanks. Some people really are bastards, It must have been the They want to try except they didn't have enough And so, they stole ours. That's so crazy! An oxygen is your safety net up there. You can't steal At this altitude, A human being shouldn't do that Well, fortunately, But the thing is that... we have to hope all goes well, All right, What just happened, Mathis? The guy Can you stand up? Come on, bro! Stand up! Come on, stand up! Thank you, bro. You're out of oxygen. You're out of oxygen! -No more oxygen? -My tank is empty? -Ah. Okay. Don't you have a Sherpa? Where's your Sherpa? What's wrong with him? They found him up there, and the Sherpas are going to take him down to an Dude, -It really hurts my heart. I can't look. We're It's the home stretch I can do this. I'm doing this for all the people To show people... you have to believe in them. I'm gonna make it. Small step by small step... I'll get there. Slowly but I'm going to suffer! But we're going to do it! I'm not gonna give up! Let's go! Camp 4! We did it, man. We made it to Camp 4. You know Goddamn! I'm so happy man! Damn, we're here, man! I've never been so We'll be up there We're gonna crush it, man! Ila! -Ah! Congratulations, man! And now Everest! Manish! Hey, brother, My bro! This year, -This year, you finally did it! We did it! Manish doesn't know yet, but if we make it to the top, As you can see... there's some debris from It's not very clean. There's trash everywhere... absolutely everywhere! There's food... and a lot of old tents. When it comes to littering... it's so extreme up here, and... the weather changes so that they can't go back up. The tents that get caught by And it's gonna create a mess, And then, who throw their Yeah, it's true! But it'll start to get better to keep the mountain clean. Unfortunately, there was and their tent was here They didn't pick up any trash... or take anything down... so, it's It's a real shame. It's bad manners. Whether it's at camp 4, or... or in Paris, uh... you throw away your trash... you don't leave it on the ground. That's the most beautiful Goddamn... We're so small, man. We're so small in this world. The summit is over there. I'm gonna I'm this close... to making my dream come true. The feeling of that you might get there... that you're two or three steps that feeling is amazing. I thought I was going to be when we got to Camp 4... That I'd be dead. We're finally in good shape! I thought but in the end I got here, I feel okay, dude! And... there's nothing more than feeling ready. But that's the goal, and to be safe. To be clear about to be to understand what's That's what's most important. Then you can make good decisions. Are you good? I'm so good. So, so good. -What do we need to leave? 9 or 10, maybe. And how many 9 or 10 hours? 9 or 10 hours to It will depend on the traffic, -A lot of people, huh? In 24 hours, The project is coming to an end. It's... kind of scary. Whatever happens, Mathis, uh... I want to thank you. So, now it's 9pm. We have a long There's no wind, but it's so cold that it stings. Man! It's time to go! Man! Let's do this. -Let's go, Manish. Here we go! To the summit! The final ascent! We're gonna do it guys. I'll give it my all, It's Ama Dablam! Crazy, huh? This is scary. There's a lot of emptiness. I didn't think it Everything is so steep. I confess... I'm scared. Goddamn... Ugh, I hate this. I hate it. A dead climber. Wait, where? Whoa, holy shit! How many years has he been here? -3 years old. Yeah. Oh no, that's crazy. Oh, my god... I'm scared Mathis. No, it's okay, it's okay... I'm scared, dammit! There are too many people. Come on! Just a little bit further! We're almost there. We're almost there! Just breathe... and listen... and observe... and before you I fucking did it! I fucking did it. We did it, bro! We did it! Come on, we did it! You did it! You did it, man. You did it. Thank you, Manish! We did it. We did it, man! We fucking did it. -You did it. You did it, bro. Thanks, it's all thanks to you! And it's all thanks to you guys! Without the Sherpas... we would never be here! We never would have made it! And thanks Mathis, we did it bro! Dude, we did it... Come on! I always wondered It's being around you guys, I know I'm not alone! The Sherpas all helped me. In the end... I did it with oxygen, but there are They're the real bosses! They're the ones who We we should just try to be... we should try to be better than, We should all do projects... We have to stop... being behind screens, and... and scrolling, Get outside! If you have a project, do it... and don't listen to people... because if I had listened to dammit! I wouldn't be here! If you want to do something... then do it! You still learned something! That's how we live! That's how we... Dude... this year dude I I feel so alive! Without you, You know that... without you, In life, nothing is done alone... No. it's better Thanks to all my friends... who have always been there... And thanks Thanks to all my partners... who are out there... And thanks to all who have always supported me, no This is our summit, We did this together. Unwrap the ribbon, "You are an inspiring man... I gave you life... and you gave that life meaning Your mom." Dude, you know... I never tell but damn, I swear, I was so scared, bro! I You killed it dude! You did good. Thank you, Ila Nuru... Hey, look... this is for Manish! Manish, congratulations my bro! You did it, bro! We did it, bro! My bro! Congratulations my, bro! Together we did it, my friend. And now... we're going back. It's not finished... we need to go back, okay? Yes. Good job, bro. It was both extraordinary... and at the same time, terrifying! And when I was there, I thought, It was overwhelming, and you're dependent on oxygen. I'm so scared Mathis. Being that high Go fast, go fast! Everyone move! Fast, fast, fast! We're we're following the ridge... and in the Hurry, hurry! Go fast! The ledge we were on 40 6 climbers fell at once. Four of them managed to hang on and the They tumbled down the slope... for 3000 meters. They died down there. But at the time, I didn't see them, You're up you can't talk, you don't And I realized that it's not just It's the human beings. When there's and it's going and that's dangerous. And that's what happened. We just found a guy who's... on the verge of life and death. So, Ines gave him the he had. He changed out the tank. And so, I went without oxygen... -on our trip back down. Well, now, it's my turn... for being tired. -I don't know if... Well, I gave my tank to that guy, wow, I can already It's been 24 Thank you so much. It was hard. It was hard mentally, but I'm so glad Um, now back to reality... My son will see my video... My son will see when he was 22 years old. Everest at 22... My son! Don't compare yourself... Do what you like, that's what's important, It doesn't matter, just make Is that my dad? I'm so proud of his success. When I was younger, I... I did what I wanted to do, It's true that it's a little my generation and his And... I'm used to it now, but before "No, I'm the one who's right, now I've changed I've adapted. Yeah, I've adapted. I had to, because I'm not stupid, Because, well... there are times when you have so I listen to him. After Everest... I didn't want to make the same I didn't go back to Paris... I didn't go back to the videos... I didn't go back to my phone... I needed to take and savor So, now I'm... isolated here. It's crazy, but I've I go from farm to farm, and I... I work in the fields.
