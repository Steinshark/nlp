Wow, check it out. The new mob. Hidden behind a mound of sand. Ope, there he goes. We love new mobs being added to Minecraft, don't we, little doggo? We think it's the best thing ever, huh? I'm sure if I broke the game in this version, nothing bad would come and attack me. Oh, big brother? Oh no! Here buddy, take that, take that. Yeah, sure. I'm sure nothing bad could possibly happen. I'm sure you'll love it. Today I'm breaking Minecraft with your dumb ideas, but it's exclusively in the new update 1.20.5. In this update, we've got the new mob, the armadillo- where'd he go? Uh, where- he's gone. There he is. The armadillo as well as doggos- I- hold on, let me get back- As well as doggos with wolf armor. I posted on my community tab asking for your dumbest ideas on how I can break the game in this new update. Oh man, you guys never cease to disappoint. You guys never cease to disappoint? That's not at all what I meant to say. You guys never cease to amaze me. Cease to disappoint? Today, if your dumb idea manages to break my game or render it unplayable, then you as the audience get one point. If my computer survives, then I get a point. If I manage to win today's video, then I get to keep this doggo alive and he'll stay alive forever. He'll be perfectly preserved for all time. But if you win, he won't survive. Sure, some of you maybe don't want that to happen to this doggo, but uh, you chose to be part of the audience, man. I don't know what to tell you. So with that, I'm gonna take this dog with me and uh, hopefully he stays alive this whole time. The- the wolf armor will save him. And with all that being said, who's first? Armydillo, an army of armadillos. Thank you, Garrett. I'm sure nothing could possibly go wrong. This is the Armydillo Soldier Spawner. And uh, we're just gonna turn it on. You know, this should just spawn an army. So here we go. Here we go. Armydillo soldiers. Here they come. Yup. Yup. I guess we just wait now. No, doggo. Don't get- don't get stuck in the army of armydillos. No, oh no, oh the danger. Oh, oh the danger. The sounds are horrifying. Oh, the horrifying army of armydillos. Oh no. Oh, never. Eventually, this probably will crash the game. You know, this army is slowly taking over. Wow, this actually is kind of spreading out, taking over. This is actually kind of insane. But for now, it's just a- it's just a- a carpet? I don't know. What happens if I just sprint through the- That's actually really cool. That was actually kind of legit. I'm just gonna- we're just gonna choose one of these. Ah, yes, the Armydillo King. The King of the Armydillo. Wow, this is really- dang, this is crazy. I think we need some more army recruits. Just gonna- just gonna place a few of these in here. Yes, new recruits. New recruits to the Armydillo. More Armydillo recruits, yeah. The Armydillo soldiers grow in number, and my doggo is getting buried. No! Yes, the Armydillo grows in number. The multitude is here. You can still see the King of the Armydillo back there, even though I am getting zero frames per second right now. Oh, it moved. Yay. Wow, it moved one frame. Look at the doggo. Just completely buried. It's all right, buddy. We'll get you out of there at some point. I'm sure, I'm sure it'll be fine. I'm sure everything will work out. No problems whatsoever. (laughing) Did you hear that sound? The sound. It just went- And it disappeared. Look, I know I'm not supposed to be rooting for you guys in this scenario, but like that was pretty funny. So yeah, you guys definitely- you definitely get the point. You get the first one. Take that first one, enjoy it. It's a good point. It was well earned. Let's move on to the next one. Drop thousands of armored wolves and make their armor break at the same time. The sound will be crazy. All right, sounds good. Let's do it. This is gonna be awful and horrible and really sad. My doggo though, stays right here. You're gonna stay. You're not gonna die. You'll be fine. Okay, let's see if this command works. Yeah, nice. Cool. Hey, little buddy. How's it going? What happens if you fall? Oh, it wasn't high enough apparently. He's still fine. Okay, you're still fine. Oh, you know what's great? This actually won't kill the dogs because it'll actually break the armor first. Cool. Very nice. Oops. This feels awful. I don't know. This feels so mean. There we go. That's much better. Way higher up in the sky. Now let's see if this doggo will survive. What happens? Looking through a cloud? Hey! All right, cool. So that means if we just go ahead and do that, right, but then we can set this to bedrock. Actually, I'm just gonna set it to glass so we can see. We'll just go ahead and hit this lever and just let it-- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, entity cramming. Okay. Just let this slowly fill up with armored doggos. Nothing could possibly go wrong here. No, this is just gonna be-- this is just gonna be pure chaos. You know, the beautiful thing is though, none of these dogs actually die. They all just-- their armor just breaks. So this could be really interesting, honestly. Oh, uh-oh, oh. Everyone's so all they just start editing cramming, which is not what I want. Okay, I'm just letting it fill up a little bit more. And then I just need to break the command block. There we go. Okay, all right, sick. And now I'm gonna go down here. Three, two, one, go! Oh, jeez. Oh, no! Whoa. That was-- oh my gosh. That was a lot of sound. Oh, no, now they're all falling off the-- oh, no. Oh, man. I-- that was-- that was insane. Didn't crash my game though. Also didn't really lag my game because we didn't really have nearly as many as the armydillo. So with that, I guess I get a point. And we didn't harm any dogs. Ignore the ones that fell off the edge here. And my doggo is completely safe. Yay! Hey, buddy. How's it going? This is all that really matters. My dog, my dog being alive, that's it. That's all that matters. That's all I really care about in this video. So hopefully that stays the case. All right, who's next? If you go to an Acacia biome-- all right, sounds good. I'm there. You may find a rare phenomenon called the Subscribe button! That's weird. That must be a new update. Oh my god. Dang. Minecraft making some crazy moves. If you're not subscribed already, you should do that. Only about 28% of the views on my channel are from people that are subscribed. And there's 3 million unique viewers. So that means if you keep coming back on the regular and you're not subscribed, why not? You're already coming back anyways. That's a smitty thing. Plus, that can help me reach a million subscribers, which would be kind of cool. So hit Subscribe. It'll be great. Wee! What happens if you have 1,000 dogs and you make them all spontaneously combust? Uh. What's going on in that head of yours? You OK there? I don't know, but there's only one way to find out. Oh boy. Oh, oh, oh, oh, that's not-- oh, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What? [LAUGHTER] Ah, ah, ah, I didn't mean to do this, but this is really funny. What is going on? I didn't mean to do that. OK, wait. There we go. There we go. Now they won't all die. Oh, they're all still going to die. Oh, no. OK, this isn't that bad. OK. Follow me, wolves, because you can all do that, apparently. Why are you the way that you are? I don't understand what's going on. This is chaos. I'm just summoning a bunch of tame dogs, and we're just going to have them all spontaneously combust and see what happens. My-- oh, they teleport. What? No. What is happening? All right, spontaneous combustion in 3, 2, 1. Oh. Oh, no. Uh-oh. [LAUGHTER] Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I go 2,000 blocks in the air. That's what happens. I believe I can fly. Oh, not-- oh, wolves are falling from a high place. Wolf was pricked to death. I can't even tell what's going on down there, but I guess we're going to go find out. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Where'd they all go? Oh, they're all-- oh, well, this is chaos. This is-- oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh, the teleporting. Oh, jeez. Oh, jeez. Oh, my gosh. This is-- this is absurd. Most of them seem fine, so that's good. Oh, my word. I'm just going to-- Oh, man. Well, it was fun while it lasted. At least my doggo is still fine. Look at him. He's beautiful. He's amazing. But it didn't crash my game, so I get a point. Nice. Cool. That was insane, though. That was probably the most absurd segment so far. Well, who's next? For every 0.1 seconds or two ticks, have an armadillo be summoned at every entity besides players. You got it. This is an observer clock, which will essentially allow me to run commands every two ticks, because that's how redstone works. Redstone operates on a two-tick cycle instead of an every-tick cycle. So because you said two ticks, we're going to do it like this. Execute at @E. Run summon armadillo. Done. Do that. Boom. OK. All right. They're summoning. I can't see where they are, though, at all. Uh-oh. Oh my gosh. It's already frozen. What the heck? What happened? It's already frozen. It happened so instantly. It just-- that was so fast. Wait. Hold on. That was so fast. It's already crashed. What the heck? That was insane. That might have been the fastest crash I've seen, like, ever. What the heck? I need to get back in there. Oh, shoot. I just opened the world that's supposed-- that's crashing. Wait. Oh, this might not work. Wait. Oh, I see some armadillos. Wait. intention, but I could-- this might-- wait. OK. We're going to try this again. And now that there's rabbits here, we might actually be able to see it happen. I'm going to also tick freeze. In theory, once I unfreeze the game, this could-- this could be insane. There's also an armadillo over there. We're going to see this happen. Tick unfreeze. Here it goes. Oh, jeez. Oh. Oh. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, yeah. Oh, see. Yep. See, it's already frozen again. It's just-- yeah. Uh. Hmm. The game is running normal. Yeah. No. That-- what? Whoa. That's-- What? hard that it disconnected me from the single-player world? Wait. It's asking for permission to-- I don't know what's going on. What is happening here? This is not-- what is this? This is not what Minecraft is supposed to look like right now. What is-- I-- you-- oh, my gosh. How much did you break my game just now? What? OK. So I said I wasn't going to give you two points, but this is still lagging in the main menu. So I feel like I'm obligated to give you a couple points on this one, because not only did you crash the world, you also somehow managed to just break every-- oh. Oh, yeah. No. anything, and it just disappeared. Fine. You get two points for that one, I guess. Jeez. That was insane. What? All right. Moving on. Free point for Knarfy. Unless you want to make it so that every wolf variant spawns every mob that has one of the same colors as that variant repeatedly. You know, I'm all right. I think I'll take the point. Thanks for the offer, though. You know that. I appreciate it. me, like, you know, I'm-- I think I'm all right. I think I'm-- I think I'm good. Thank you, though. I appreciate that. What do you think? You think that was a good idea? Yeah. You think that was a good idea? I think it was a good idea. Thank you for the free point. Let's move on. Use a command block to spawn a lot of armadillos, and use the changing size option with the commands to make them all giant. Nice. Cool. I've already done that a couple of times in this video, and it turns out really funny. So let's do it. OK, so I've set this up, and-- uh, oh, uh-oh. Don't worry about that. I've gone ahead and set it up so that any armadillo just gets scaled up. [LAUGHS] So if I just take myself a little armadillo, spawn egg, pop one down here, then-- Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh, I just-- oh, no. I just ruined-- oh, no. Oh, there we go. Run. Go. Go. Do the thing. Do the thing. No? Oh, oh, oh, cut. Maybe? Here we go. Does that work? Ah, I got it. I got it. Oh, that one. Uh-oh. Yeah, now they're all giant armadillos, and now we can spawn a bunch of them. Because that's how it goes on this channel. We tend to do that quite a bit. Boop, boop. Oh, no. Oh, jeez. Oh, gosh. Oh, wait. Oh, j-- OK. Uh, OK, wait. Hold on. OK, I need to get rid of this. I need to-- oh, no. OK, well, I guess I'm just going to-- oh, no. I thought I might be able to get rid of the command block before it got to this point, but I don't think there's much hope of that now. Well, the armydillo returns, and they're all just giants. This is-- this is fine. Oh, no. They're all entity-craming, too. Oh, no. I can't tell what's going on. There's a command block somewhere down here. Somewhere in this mess. Oh, jeez. I can't even get to the command block, but they're also all just dying right now, so there's nothing I can really do. And it's also not going to crash because they're just dying, so it's not going to build up. It's just going to slowly, over time, just-- it's going to stay like this pretty much. This is-- this is absurd, though. This just-- this just looks crazy. I also just love that, like, randomly throughout this entire area, you can just see armadillos that are just gigantic. They're just around. They're just chilling. And then there's just this sea of chaos and pain and suffering. And somewhere in there is my dog, so that's cool. That's great. I'm sure-- oh, he's right here. Hey, buddy. How's it going? I'm so glad I didn't sit you down. Jeez. Anyways, this is just going to continue to be like this for all eternity and for all time. So I'm just going to-- I'm just going to snag that point from you. Thank you very much. It's not going to crash my game, so it's mine. Thank you. Appreciate it. Enlarge lots of TNT and send it all off. That's in the update, right? Well, judging from the previous segment, absolutely. So let's do that. I guess the best way to do it is just to-- I'm going to freeze this to an always active command block here. In theory, every single one of these that I'm placing down should spawn a TNT above it. I don't know if this is going to quite work the way that I think it will, though. We're just going to-- we're going to test this a little bit, because I know what you're going for, but I just want to do this right. You know, I want to make it chaotic and amazing. OK, so that's all those, right? And then if I just run-- that is that and that. OK, all right. And if I just do this, tick unfreeze. That didn't quite-- that didn't quite do what I thought I would. Here's what I'm thinking it's supposed to do. If I put this down and I light it, then then in theory, oh, well, my command block's not even working. Great. Are you not able to do this? Does this feature not work? Prime TNT is not a valid entity for this command. Mm. All right. So I guess I just literally can't do this one. I definitely thought you could, because you know what you can do it with? A fireball, which is really interesting. I think you can do that. Oh, you can't even do it with a fireball? You can't do it with explosives? Oh, man, that's so sad. Well, I guess in this case, my editor gets a point, because they had to watch through this whole thing. I'm so sorry. You can take that point. You enjoy that point. That might be the first point you've ever gotten. Man, that's so unfortunate. I could have sworn you could have scaled these up and given it just like a massive-- Build a mob farm or just use commands, give them the oozing effect and kill the mobs. Repeat for 10 minutes, 15 minutes? Technically, that's a 1.21 feature, but I'll allow it. I think I'm just going to spawn a ton of zombies up here. Just going to-- yep. The lever on there. In theory, where do these guys land? Nice. Cool. &quot;Effect give at e type equals zombie oozing infinite five true.&quot; Let's see if that works. And oozing, yeah. All right, here we go. What could possibly go wrong? If you're not aware what oozing does, yeah, it does this. This is a new 1.21 effect. It basically does this. It spawns some slimes. Yeah, this really-- it gets a little chaotic real quick. I assume also if I just either just put like another couple commands down here. Let's just do this. Yeah, nice. Cool. Awesome. Love to see it. Yeah, this is going well. I guess we could just run this for a few minutes here and just let it go. I don't even know if we're going to make it to 15 minutes. You know what? To speed it up even further though, I think we'll just add a few more of these in here and just see what happens. Yeah, nice. Here we go. Oh, jeez. Oh, yeah, nice. What does this sound like? Nice. Yep, that's kind of-- yep, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. All right, I don't think we're going to need 15 minutes for this one. I think this is just going to work. You know, I think it's just going to function correctly. I'm just going to sit up here with my pupper and just kind of watch the carnage unfold. Oh, yeah. Yeah, we're in unplayable territory now, baby. Yeah, I'd say this counts. I think this is a point for you. This is very much unplayable. This is at a point where, yeah, I think it's pretty unplayable. You take that point. Take that point. Enjoy it. You enjoy that point. I don't know if I'm going to win. This dog might not make it. Oh, my gosh, the insanity behind me. All right, let's move on before it gets too slimy in here. Make a flat world of copper trap doors and spawn a hundred breezes because the breezes can open them. Also, technically not one point twenty point five, but I'll still allow it because it does sound cool. I am in the one point twenty point five version of the game with just experimental features on. So it counts, right? It's fine. It's included in the core version of the game. This is a super flat world made out of copper trap doors. And as was pointed out, wind charges can activate trap doors, which could be could be could be interesting. Huh? breezes all over the place here? Just just going to summon a few. Just going to summon a few of them and then just go to survival mode. What happens? Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, no. Oh, hey, buddy. How's it going? Oh, goodbye. Wow. They're all dead. What about this? We're going crazy mode, baby. Oh, geez. This is probably not going to end well. Oh, my gosh. Please let me escape. Parkour. All I want to do is get away. All I want to do is get away. All I'm trying to do is get away. Oh, yes. I got away. I got away. I got away. Oh, my gosh. They're following me. They're following me. Oh, I can't run through the middle. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, no. Through through the middle through parkour. I am surviving way longer than I did before on the lines. Oh, my gosh. This is absurd. This is absurd. This is absurd. This is absurd. Cool. Oh, they're following me. Oh, they're following. Hey, guys. How's it going? Oh, geez. How am I still alive. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. I really just love running through right in the middle here. Just because all of them get triggered. Oh, my gosh. Oh, no. That is cool. That is really cool. Oh, no. Oh, geez. Okay, one more time through the middle. One more time through. Ah, I was just trying to go around, man. Oh, no. Escape escape. Okay, through the middle through the middle. Okay, through the middle through the middle. I'm going to jump right over the middle command block. If I even can get there. Oh, my gosh. I was going to try to jump over it. Come on. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. I don't know how I survived for so long with these. Okay. Okay. Okay. Well, this is absolute chaos, but it didn't crash my game even a little bit. So I get the point. I get the point, guys. I got the point on this one. I got the point. Are you proud of me? I got it. I got the point. It's my point. It's my point. This is so absurd. Okay. Oh, man. The fun part is I don't even know if I won. Did I win? Show me the points. Show me the points. Yes. I've won. I've done it. I saved the doggo. You're safe. You're safe, little buddy. Gonna give you a steak in celebration. Those darn commenters couldn't do enough to destroy you. We can't let them ever get to you. You must always be safe. So for that reason, we're summoning you another armydillo. Oh, jeez. They just covered them. Uh-oh. Okay. We're summoning a lot of armydillows. It's okay, bud. You'll be safe now. They've got you. They're gonna save you. They're gonna keep you safe. They're gonna... They're gonna... What does this button do? Uh, well, subscribe. Hey, he's fine!
