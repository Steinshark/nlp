When the man prepared to leave, she showed signs of reluctance. She was well-behaved and showed no signs of aggression. It's unknown why she was abandoned here, Her actions indicated a great deal of trust in humans. Surprisingly, she followed the man all the way home, And that's how the man unexpectedly adopted a dog, She even voluntarily followed when going out, without a leash. The man bought her some chicken breast, She is lacking love. After a few steps, she always looked back at the man, She may have tried this approach many times, begging humans for adoption, But she was always rejected and left out, Life is full of surprises, Happiness also arrives unexpectedly, She worries about losing it unexpectedly, So she humbly displays her obedience, Hoping that the human in front of her won't abandon her again. She is a very clingy little dog, Having been homeless for too long, she yearns for love. That's why she is deeply attached to her owner, The owner gave her a name, calling her &quot;Rib.&quot; Every time she goes out with her owner, she is extremely happy. Being with her owner is her favorite thing. She was too weak, suffering from severe malnutrition. So her owner fed her chicken breast for every meal. One day, the man came home from work and found his dog missing. The man frantically searched everywhere. The dog was driven away by his landlord. Because he didn't allow tenants to keep dogs in his house. It had been three hours, and still no sign of her. The man was extremely frustrated and heartbroken. He returned to the McDonald's where they first met. Sure enough, she was there. Seeing her owner, Rib's eyes were filled with grievance. Grievance mixed with happiness. Although it was only a few hours apart, For Rib, it felt like another farewell. She must have been very sad when she was driven out by the landlord. She probably thought she was abandoned again. Fortunately, this time her owner wouldn't give up on her. To appease Rib and express his apology, The owner bought her delicious food at the restaurant. That night, they secretly returned home together. The next day, the man took Rib to the hospital. The well-behaved Rib received praise from the doctor. Rib is three years old. She has many parasites on her body and needs a bath and deworming. Trimming her nails, Cleaning her ears. She weighs only seven kilograms. She has multiple scars on her body. Rib is so thin that even the nurse feels sorry for her. The doctor first performed external deworming on her. She cooperated well when taking internal deworming medicine. Her hind leg was fractured in a car accident and has not healed yet. So she limps when walking. She needs proper nutrition and medication at home. She can only return to the hospital for a follow-up appointment after one week. Therefore, she needs to eat well. Every time she eats, she needs her owner to pat her head. If she's not patted, she won't eat. She doesn't like to eat from a bowl. She always carries the food to the floor and eats there. There was an issue during a walk after a meal. She had difficulty defecating. The doctor said it was due to chronic stricture of the intestines from being a stray. Medication needs to be applied to her anus before each bowel movement. Today, as usual, her owner took her outside to defecate. Accidentally, her tail was touched during the medication preparation. She immediately cried out in pain and almost bit her owner.

The surgery is about to begin. The surgery lasted for three hours. The leg problem has persisted for too long, resulting in severe bone deformity. So her surgery took a relatively long time. Half an hour later, Ribs regained consciousness from anesthesia. That's how Ribs stayed in the hospital for recovery. Meanwhile, the owner needed to move because the landlord didn't allow him to keep a dog. So the man had to find another house. That way, Ribs would never be kicked out again. Due to Ribs' inability to go up and down stairs after the surgery, so the man specifically rented a single-story house. Although this small home is simple, they are happy to be together. Finally, Ribs can be discharged from the hospital. The owner came to the hospital to pick her up and bring her home. She was excitedly wagging her tail when she saw the owner. The doctor suggested that Ribs should swim regularly, which is beneficial for the post-surgery recovery of her leg muscles. Putting on the traction rope, they are ready to go home.
