So A LOT of people have been saying really, really good things about this game I've have A LOT of people ask me in the comments to play it and since &quot;Fran Bow&quot; finished, I was like, &quot;I need a new game to play. I need something else that I wanna play that's story driven, something that I can do voices for as well&quot;, which I'm gonna to be doing for this because, ah, this is all like &quot;text-based&quot; and there's no actual I don't think there's any actual spoken dialogue in the game, so I wanted to do somethin' just to- just another game kinda like that. And it looks really cool- aah, I've heard really, really good things about it, and I'm VERY MUCH looking forward to playing this, so, LET'S GET IN! Let's &quot;Begin Game&quot; I'm using a controller, I don't know how... I don't know how good that should be. Oooh! &quot;Name the fallen human.&quot; [Intensely] OOOooh!

Oooh. And it's supposed to have a really, really good story, which I was- [Reading in Flowey voice] That's a great name. [Continues reading in Flowey voice] It's very dark!

[Reading on-screen text] [Jack is horrified] Oh! I thought you like pulled out your eye or something! [Reading on-screen text] Oh. [Reading on-screen text] *laughs* &quot;Friendliness pellets&quot;? Tho dont- those don't sound friendly. [Reading] (Bad choices were made) Oh! &quot;You idiot.&quot; YOU LIED TO ME!

I am Toriel, caretaker of the Ruins.&quot; &quot;I pass through this place everyday to see if anyone has fallen down.&quot; Thank you! I was gettin' fucked up by a flower there for a second. &quot;You are the first human to come down here in a long time. Come! I will guide you through the catacombs.&quot; So, straight away: DO NOT trust ANYTHING you see! That's- that's my take away from this. &quot;This way.&quot; Look how cute I am! ( **e**`) I like my little jumper. And my little walk cycle &quot; Dum dee dum dee dum &quot; *laughing* Awesome. Uum, and I know a lot of people were asking me to play more games like this, it's very much- it's not an RPG maker game, but it has similar vibes to it, like: REALLY good story, thi-um- simple-ish kind of graphics, but trust me, it'll pay out in the end! Uh, from what I've heard, this is a really good game; really good story, characters, ALL that stuff, so I'm looking forward to this, I'm excited! What is this?

That was so awesome, I got that for Christmas one time! [Jack reminisces] &quot;Welcome to your new home, innocent one. Allow me to educate you in the operation of the ruins.&quot; Oh, do I have to do that too? (No) &quot;The ruins are full of puzzles. Ancient fusions between diversions and door keys.&quot; One must solve the to move from room to room.&quot; &quot;Please adjust yourself to the sight of them.&quot; *Adjusting sight* DONE! *giggling* Sa-do I- do I have to do the same?

You will need to be prepared for this situation.&quot; &quot;However, worry not! The process is simple. When you encounter a monster, you will enter a fight.&quot; &quot;While you are in a fight, strike up a friendly conversation. Stall for time. I will come to resolve the conflict.&quot; &quot;Practice talking to the dummy.&quot; I have to talk in battle? (*_*" Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh &quot;You encountered the Dummy.&quot; Uuuum...

What are my stats? &quot;Weapon: Stick. Armor: Bandage.&quot; Those don't sound like very good things. Uuuh, &quot;item.&quot; Uh, &quot;use item&quot; Ca-I can't use an item. Okay, I probably have none. Can I leave?! A froggit! I'm gonna- Ah! &quot;Ring.&quot; [Reading] Yeah, is that froggit going to attack me? Is it like Pokemon rules, that if I run out in front of him, it's just gonna *Pokemon battle theme: a wild froggit appeared* No. Okay. Can I save? [Reading] Imma save! Yeah! Okay, so I should explain that this is like what the game is. This is like th-the like the aesthetic, the music, the- it's gonna be a lot of talkin' so if this is not your thing, I'm sorry, this playthrough is probably not gonna be for you uh, but, I-I think that this is gonna be really good, I think that this has a lot of potential to be a really great series. The characters are very witty-I like them already and I've barely even gotten into the game and I-I just like, I like the world, and people were saying it gets even better Fuck! &quot;Whimsun...approached meekly&quot; Should I do something? &quot;Console.&quot; You look very downtrodden. Should I-should I be nice to you? [Reading] &quot;You won. You earn nothing.&quot; Aaaaw. I wanted to help the whimsun. ( ._.) Let's talk to Mr. Froggit. &quot;Ribbit, ribbit&quot; [Reading like his mouth is numb] *Frog impression* (not bad) That's my frog impression, is that pretty good? *Frog noises* I think that's pretty decent. That's a pretty good frog impression. I mean as far as frog impressions go, you could get worse. So, I should give some monsters mercy. Got it. What is this? [Reading] Oooh, piece of candy! Why not? [Reading] *scoffs* Ooh, is that my health? Oh, okay, sweet! Got it! Can I play through the leaves? Yeah, crinkle-crinkle. Oh shit! &quot;A froggit hopped close&quot; Do you WANT to fight me? Why can't I do anything? Oh, I can only fight?! What the fuck is going on?! *Frog noises* Oh, whaddo I do? AH! Froggit motherfucker! &quot;Froggit doesn't seem to know why it's here&quot; Cool, I can't like choose &quot;Act&quot;, &quot;Item&quot;, or &quot;Mercy&quot;, I HAVE to fight. It's not workin'! Rrrruh! Right in the middle! Yes! *More frog noises* Okay, dodge his attack this time! AH! YES! &quot;Froggit is trying to run away&quot; Um, &quot;Act&quot; &quot;Compliment&quot; Yeah. Should we let him go, er... Oh, maybe I'm getting 0 EXP 'cause I'm not actually fighting anybody. That makes sense. I don't wanna fight people. [Reading] Aaaaaaaw! I made a frog blush * _ * Geh-stay away from the flies Sh- oh yeah, &quot;stay away from the flies.&quot; I. uh, I-I went near one of them to see if I was actually supposed to get them. &quot;Froggit is trying to run away.&quot; No! Stay! Bup. Bup. Boo dee doo doo doo Come on! Show me your flies! Ah! D-don't get hit! Don't get hit! Should I show him mercy? Yeah! &quot;Spare&quot; [Reading] Yaaaaaay! Hey! Frog dude! Ribbit, ribbit. I saved y- I spared your friend! I'm gonna do this. Just 'cause I need more health. Don't judge me! 'Kay. &quot;File saved.&quot; Cool, let's move on. (We won't judge you, but that Froggit will) Puzzle, puzzle? Oh no! Where am I? Heh! Oh, sweet! I did it! *laughs* &quot;Ring!&quot; [Reading] I'm a bit a fan of the cinnamon. A bit 'o the c-mon. I mean, b-scotch is fine, b-scotch is okay. I like butterscotch in ice cream. That's good, and butterscotch like, hard candies are pretty nice But overall, in general, I'm pretty sure I like cinnamon a lot more. Cinnamon. &quot;Oh, I see. Thank you very much!&quot; *gasps* Are you makin' me a cake? 'Cause, oh you! Don't make me a cake! (please make me a cake!) I'd love a cake. Okay, there's a rock... [Reading] *laughs* No, I-see I told ya, I don't mind the b-scotch man. The b-scotty is fine with me. [Reading] Oh, &quot;Thank you for being patient, by the way.&quot; Oh, okay. What does this say? [Reading] *laughs* See! I like this! This is clever. This is fun. There we go. Aw man! Oh, it's a Whimsun! I'm gonna-I wanna show mercy! I don't think he wants to fight &quot;You won. You earned 0 EXP and 0 gold.&quot; Am I SUPPOSED to be fighting things? I dunno. -- I-I have heard that there's very much like a pacifist, or a, like a homicidal maniac kinda thing, so you can go like you can go the route of sparing things or fighting things. And I don't know how much that applies to everything, because like, games like &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; that I've played before, you could do that as well, like any of the bosses you fought or any of the enemies you fought, you could spare them all Like &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3&quot; I remember playin' that I could spare everyone if I wanted to, so I don't know if I can actually spare everyone or if I some of the bosses I HAVE to fight, like &quot;Deux Ex Human Revolution,&quot; it was like: you can spare everybody but if you have all the pacifist stuff in the boss rooms, you're FUCKED! 'cause they're really hard. Heh. Can I go through you? No. Okay. Damn it! AH no! I fell down a hooooooole! OH this is showing me the path! Oh, I get it! So we go: across to the wall, down, across, up, down- oh, okay. I get it &quot;Please don't step on the leaves.&quot; Okay. Got it. Got it got it got it got it. Clever. Clever clogs! Sweet! Okay, I can do this! FUCK! What am I fightin'? &quot;Moldsmal blocked the way&quot; Let's talk to a moldsmal. &quot;Imitate&quot; &quot;You lie...immobile&quot;- [Reading] Just by lying down with the little jellyfish dude. &quot;Slime sounds.&quot; Oka- like *disgusting squishing sounds* Oh! The little white things hit me as well! Fuck! &quot;Moldsmal waits pensively.&quot; Uuum... Let's &quot;Check.&quot; [Reading] *laughs* 'Kay, so it's &quot;curvaceously attractive&quot; so maybe I should flirt with it. &quot;Blurble blurb&quot; Okay, so dodge these muhfuckers. Oh. You guys don't explode, that's much easier. Okay, so we're gonna flirt with the moldsmal [Reading] (in a very sassy voice) &quot;Oooh, Moldsmal!&quot; Talk dirty to me! *More squishing noises* That's the sound it's makin' Bup bup boo doo doo! Can I like, spare you? &quot;Spare.&quot; &quot;You won! You earned zereh-zero EXP and 1 gold.&quot; Okay, good. 'Kay, so we go all the way down here.... then we arooooss, uuuuup... across... down, aw I didn't see the end of it! (don't step there!) AAAAAAAAAH! NOOOOHOOOO! (told ya!) Ah shit! Oh, I should've been okay, I can go all the way across to the wall. Okay, I don't think I actually have to care about the leaves here, do I? *laughs* (the sign said you do but whatever) Okay, got it. I wish you would show me the path that I actually have done! &quot;Moldsmal blocked the way.&quot; 'Kay so...I HAVE to fight?! Oooooh nooooo! I just clicked into &quot;Fight&quot; by mistake&quot; (tell that to that poor froggit from earlier) I'm gonna spare you. I don't know if I'm supposed to be doin' that. Hopefully I can find out sooner or later. Am I doing good? Am I doing good? Okay, all the way to the edge...yeah, I did it! Whoop whoop! Do I have to push ALL of you? DAMN IT! All these fights! &quot;A pair of froggits hop towards you.&quot; *inhales* Ooh.... Uuuh, &quot;Check&quot; [Reading] *bad frog impression* AH GOD! No! Dodge the flies! Dodge the flies! Motherfucker! I was too busy trying to make frog sounds. [Reading] [laughing] Okay.... &quot;Hop, hop&quot; &quot;Croak, croak.&quot; Okay, so I can't spare them. It wasn't yellow. AH FUCK! &quot;Froggit hops to and fro.&quot; I can't-I can't spare so... we're going to-we're going to comliment Froggit B.&quot; He didn't understand what I said, but he was flattered anyway. &quot;Hop, hop&quot; &quot;(Blushes deeply) Ribbit.&quot; Okay, so maybe I can spare HIM. I-I'll- I'll compliment both. See, when their names turn yellow, it seems that you're on good terms with them. Aw, now they're both blushing. Sweet! AH! Fuck! &quot;Froggit seem reluctant to fight you.&quot; Sweet, so I can spare you. Nice! I think I'm gettin' it. I think I'm understandin' what's going on. So you can't just spare them straight away- [Reading in a southern accent] Is the rock talkin' to me?! [Reading] [More reading] No! Back down! [What's this? Reading? Ahh!] Thank you, Mr. Rock. Can't believe I just talked to a rock. Between a rock and a hard place, am I right? Ha Haaaa! Ho ho! These are the jokes people...(!_!) &quot;Was that helpful?&quot; [Stronger accent] &quot;Was that helpful?&quot; O-oh! NO! Go back! [Reading] Thank you. Thank you-now you can move back to whatever way you want. Thank you Mr. Rock! I'm gonna call you Rocky. &quot;Pardner.&quot; FUCK! I tripped into a line of moldsmals! God dammit, I'm so clumsy! I can spare moldsmals instantly. Sweet. But maybe if I talked to them a bit more, maybe I could have got more gold. Maybe that's how it works. I dunno. [Reading] Cool. Can I... [Reading] Can I talk to the mouse? *squeak squeak squeak squeak squeak squeak squeak* I can! Okay... Can I DO anything? Maybe I can get new cheese. I dunno. Ooooh, a ghost! *obnoxious snoring* [ghostily] &quot;Are they gone yet?&quot; [Reading] Yeah! Heh. Oh no! &quot;Here comes Napstablook&quot; *some groovy-ass tunes* Duh, duh duh duh Napstablook? 'Kay, were gonna &quot;Check.&quot; Aw the music in this game is AWESOME! [Reading] [ghostily] &quot;Oh I'm REAL funny&quot; Are you crying? Oh God! Oh Jesus Christ! Fuckin' hell! [Reading] Can I spare you? Fuck, I can't. Okay... Uuuuum.... I wanna cheer you. This is very like speakeasy 1920's music. I fuckin' love this! &quot;You gave Napstablook a patient smile.&quot; &quot;heh&quot; [Reading] *laughs* Do I do anything? &quot;Napstablook just likes&quot;- &quot;looks a little better.&quot; 'Kay, I can't spare you YET. Uuum... Let's cheer you again! &quot;You told Napstablook a little joke.&quot; Um, how d- how do, um, astronauts get ready for a party? They-they &quot;planet.&quot; Ha. *snaps* Fuck! I think I messed that joke up! &quot;heh, heh&quot; Oh no, your tears again! This is fuckin' hard to dodge. Oooh God Almighty! I'm losing a lot of health! [Reading] I can't spare you yet, though. Ahm, cheer, we'll keep cheering you. Go Napstablook! Everybody! *claps* WHOO NAPSTABLOOK! YEAH! Everybody! A hug for Napstablook. Let's cheer him up, he's a sad little ghost. &quot;Napstablook&quot;- is that a- Napstablook, yeah.

[ghostily] &quot;Do you like it?&quot; I really do! &quot;Napstablook eagerly awaits your response.&quot; Uuuuuum, 'kay I can't spare you yet. I'm going to...I can't compliment, should I flirt? Let's flirt. Oh no! [Ghostily] Did I do good? 'Cause the music stopped instantly when I flirted and I thought I came on too strong What age am I? Why am I flirting with creatures? Okay, Mr. Little Ribbit King is here. [Reading] Actually, [Like an over-dramatic game-show host] &quot;Come eat food made by spiders, FOR spiders, OF SPIDERS!&quot; There, I sold it more. Now you wanna go, dontcha? (yes) I'm gonna go. Actually, I'm gonna use monster candy. [Reading] Sweet! Now I can go fight a bunch of dudes again. Ooh, spider bake sale!

That's fuckin' 3 times as much as I have! *sick frog impression* *disappointed sigh* [I think his mouth may be numb] Should I press something else then? Aw man! That's what I'm doing! [Reading] *laughs* Aw man, that's so sad! *frog noises* [This frog kinda sounds like Papyrus] It can, but it's gonna mess up my capture. Maybe I can do it after. Maybe the next episode I'll do that. I don-I don't know. I-I'm kinda afraid to mess around with that stuff yet. [Reading] '*ribbit' tth_tth Oooookay? Hi. 'ribbit ribbit' (This frog sounds like Papyrus too) [Reading] Oooookay. Got it. I-yeah. That's-that's kinda what I kinda figured, 'cause when the two frogs came up one of the had a yellow name after I flirted with 'em &quot;What do you think of that?&quot; It's.... &quot;Very helpful&quot; &quot;It's bad&quot; &quot;Very helpful!&quot; [Reading] *ringing* Uh okay, OH!

'Kay, his stuff isn't THAT hard to avoid. Can avoid it better than a fuckin' vegetoid He was an ASS! There we go. I got 5 gold. I have a lot of gold now. [Instructions] Okay, ah, 'cause this is a thing about perspective. It's telli- I shoulda pressed the blue switch the first time! Go over here. Don't fight another dude! Yes. &quot;Nothing happened&quot; Did it? Did nothing happen? Shite! Okay. Oh no! OH NO! (fuck) Where am I now? Oh I'm-I'm b- I'm back out here. Okay, so what does this say? [Don't forget this time] So... *annoyed sigh* &quot;A rotation in perspective,&quot; so do I press this guy? &quot;It's a switch. Press it?&quot; Yes. &quot;Nothing happened.&quot; What happens if I press YOU? FACK! Aw no! I think I can- I can spare the moldsmal already. &quot;Bein' me is the best&quot; He's just gonna dance out and chill out Sweet, that was easy, okay. Thank God. &quot;It's a switch. Press it?&quot; Yes. &quot;Nothing happened.&quot; Fuck! Oookay, do you- SHITE! I don- I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. It should be- it's probably very simple [For a third time] 'Kay, so you are like: green, blue, red... maybe it's all changed around when I go in here. [FINALLY!] &quot;It's a switch. Press it?&quot; Yes. &quot;You hear a clicking sound.&quot; Yaaaaay! I did it! I don't know why...or how. Okay, what do you say? [Instructions] Am I supposed to trust you? Mmmkay, that's good. It seems like it should be, um, going against me or should be trying to trick me, but it wasn't, oh shit shit shit shit shit shit! Gooot it. So tha-that's what all the battle system is, is that you're like, avoiding shit like, to not get hit There we go. Wait, do I HAVE any other items? No. Fuck! *nervous inhale* This is bad, I can't afford to fight anymore! Uum... [Instructions] I don't know- aw shit! Are these, like, showin' me the perspective and I'm not gettin' it? I'm gonna guess this one (you guessed wrong) Fuck! Green switch is not there... *gasps* I have to go all the way back to the start?! Oh no! Is the thing open, though? Okay, it is. Just keep on runnin'. Keep on runnin' little Sam! 'Kay, so, left pillar then. Ah, it's gonna give me a battle. &quot;It's a switch. Press it?&quot; Yeeeeeeeah! It's a pity I didn't see what switch it was when you're there lookin' at it. Fuck! Spare the moldsmal. Oh! You're just gonna be you. Sweet. Just dance around, bro! Good ol' Migosp There we go. I still have to figure that out. You guys are gonna have to tell me in the comments if I'm doin' something good....or something bad. Am I free? I don't know if I should be walkin' on RED leaves. A tree! [Reading] &quot;I would&quot;- &quot;than I thought it would.&quot; Toriel! Hi! Are you ringing me? [Reading] I wonder if I had, like, stayed back at the start and just waited it out, would they have come back for me anyway? I doubt it, but it would've been funny if it did. Oh, I can heal! Aaaahhh. [Reading] Nice! 'Kay. Let's keep on moseying on down! Nice house! [Reading] Eeeeewww! I don't want no snail pie. Is it a sword?! I'm gonna look around a bit. I assume I'm not gonna- oh, this is nice! [Reading] *laughing* *laughing* [Reading] Aw, nice, warm fire (*_*) [Reading] DON'T do that. &quot;Seems like the right size for Toriel&quot; Let's check around your house. Let's steal all your shit. Everything's very brown in here. [CHOCOLATE] Can I have it? &quot;There is some white fur stuck in the drain.&quot; Aawww. &quot;What a nice smell. Too hot to eat, though.&quot; That's my cinnamon-butterscotch pie. I'm gonna eat that up! I'm gonna- I'm gonna have a nice time eating that. Um, let's just go find Toriel, let's see what's up. &quot;This is it.&quot; Aw, I l- I like the way she grabs your hand. &quot;A room of your own. I hope you like it.&quot; Aawww (**) [Reading] Heh heh! I don't know if I should trust Toriel...yet. This game was- this game immediately was like: &quot;Aww, I'll be nice to you....DIE!&quot; So I don't know if Toriel's gonna be like, &quot;Here, have a butterscotch pie!&quot; And then SHIV you in your sleep. I hope not. I like Toriel. Is this MY room? Aawww. &quot;An empty photo frame. It's really dusty.&quot; &quot;A box of kid's shoe in a dis- in dis- a disparity in sizes.&quot; I don't know what I'm sayin'. &quot;A box on kid's shoes,&quot; okay. Can I take some new clothes? No. Can I sleep? I went to bed. She left a piece of pie for me! :) That's so cute! &quot;You found a slice of butterscotch-cinnamon pie.&quot; *nyam nyam nyam nyam nyam nyam* *snorts* Can I go back to bed? That's adorable! 'Kay, let's head out. Are we good? Is this Toriel's room? Looks like it. Ooh, what's this room? &quot;Room under renovations&quot; I have a mirror! Aw, awesome! Look how cute I am! My little cutie face. (*_*) I look like Brock. I look like I'm always like ( -_- ) just eyes closed, content with stuff. 'Kay, let's go find Toriel. Toriel! Are you over here? Aaaaawww. She reminds me of, um, remember that show &quot;Arthur?&quot; Was that what it was called? She reminds me of a character from that. [Reading] Okay, so I fell from the heavens, from the glorious above world of humans, down below, where people are afraid of human attacks, but they just accepted me... It was like, y-y-you fought a war WITH humans, but I just came down, you were like &quot;Hey! Come on home, have some pie.&quot; &quot;You did want something?&quot; Or &quot;did you want something?&quot; Why do I always find it hard to read stuff when I'm doin' voices. Sorry. Um, &quot;When can I go home?&quot; Aww. [Reading] Suuuure. Let's hear all about the snails. Mmyeeeeaah Is that true? That snails flip their digestive systems? I don't even know what that means... Ah, the pie has one slice gone out of it. [Reading] *laughs* Can I talk to you again? &quot;What is it?&quot; &quot;How to exit the ruins&quot; I'm sorry, did I do something bad? &quot;Seems like the right size for Toriel.&quot; Okay. Imma check the stairs. Let's go to the basement. *sniffs* *Uneasy silence* See what I mean?! Stuff just changed dramatically. I knew you'd be down here. [Reading] See what I mean?! I'm not trustin' this shit! Toriel? Hi. [Reading] This got scary all of a sudden. No, I'm- I am the chosen one. I will fix it. [Reading] *sniffs* Yo! What's up? Imma follow you. Maybe I should have saved. [Reading] NO! I have to fight Toriel?! I have to fight my mother?! &quot;Toriel blocks the way.&quot; Let's see, &quot;Check&quot; &quot;Attack 80, defense 80!&quot; &quot;Knows what's best for you.&quot; Oh, BALLSAROONIE! Fuckin' hell! Mom! She is strong! (Check out those dance moves) BOOOOO DOOOOO *giggles* &quot;Toriel looks through you.&quot; &quot;Talk&quot; &quot;You couldn't think of any conversation topics&quot; I'm gonna die! I'm g- that's all that's gonna happen is I'm gonna die! This is *exhales*...good God! Uuuum... Uh *nervous laughs* [Reading] FUCK MAN! (look at Toriel when Jack dies) JESUS CHRIST! Well then... Game over. You died. So long. Farewell. [Reading] Thank you, God. Maybe. I dunno. *tsk* Aw man, I have to go back and do all this. Okay, let's see what happens if we show mercy. &quot;Spare.&quot; Three-th- Oh Jesus FUCK! Ooooowah! How did I dodge all them?! That was awesome! Okay, now there's two sets o' dots. Okay, so this must be the right thing to do. Fuck. Fack! Aaaah! Jesus! Okay, I'm actually doin' okay! I'm doin' pretty well. 'Kay so &quot;Spare.&quot; Keep sparin', okay, so this is the right thing to be doin'! *inhales* Ooooowooshie woosh! Okay, so I know how to dodge that if that keeps happenin'. &quot;Toriel is acting aloof.&quot; Good ol' Toriel. Question mark. Fuck, this is the hard one. This- oh God almighty Jesus! Actually doin' okay! I was dead by this time last time. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; I'm trying to avoid YOU! AAAH MOM NO! Ah shit, I got hit by one! Okay, so when there's one thing on its own it's harder. &quot;Spare.&quot; &quot;Attack or run away.&quot; Imma just sit here and not do anything. Fuck! FUCK! I'm at one health. &quot;Spare.&quot; &quot;What are you proving this way?&quot; I'm proving that you- *Confused Jackaboy* None of the stuff is after me. Ooooooh! Maybe none of the stuff comes after me because she doesn't want to kill me. 'Cause my health is really low. Let's test it. &quot;Fight me or leave!'&quot; OOOOOooooh! Well then I can't lose! Oh. &quot;I know you want to go home, but...&quot; &quot;But please, go upstairs, now!&quot; Oooh. &quot;I promise I will take good care of you here.&quot; &quot;I know we do not have much, but...&quot; &quot;We can have a good life here.&quot; &quot;Why are you making this so difficult?&quot; Aw, mom... &quot;Please, go upstairs.&quot; &quot;Ha ha...&quot; &quot;Pathetic, is it not?&quot; &quot;I cannot save even a single child.&quot; &quot;No, I understand. You would just be unhappy trapped down here.&quot; &quot;The Ruins are very small once you get used to them.&quot; &quot;It would not be right for you to grow up in a place like this.&quot; &quot;My expectations...my loneliness...my fear...&quot; &quot;For you, my child, I will put them aside.&quot; Aaaww [Reading] Aaaawww! Hugs- hugs for mom! Hugs for Toriel! Go after her! Go after her! I think she's gone...okay. Movin' on. Aw mom! *sniffles* SHE WAS THE BEST MOM I'VE EVER HAD! HEY MA! Sorry! *laughing* Okay, movin' on. Oh God, the music stopped. Ooh, this is freaky. Ooh, this is freaky! I don't like it! It's makin' me uncomfortable. Oh, there IS an end to it, I thought it was gonna go on forever. Flower dude! [Reading like a demon] &quot;pretty great&quot;- &quot;really great&quot; *the laugh of pure evil* *Jack joins in* What a creepy bastard! Are you just gonna go away? Okay. Thanks. *laughs* Well, movin' on! Thanks Mr. Flower Dude. *cymbal crescendo* *Dun* [Deep, growling voice] &quot;Undertale&quot; *Dun* &quot;By Toby Fox&quot; [Normal voice] It's like fuckin' &quot;Law and Order&quot; *Dung-ung-ung-ung-ung-ung* *Dun* *giggles* Do it again! *silence* Aw, man. Heh heh! Okay. Movin' on. Oh, wait, does this rock say anything? &quot;There's a camera hidden in the bushes.&quot; That's a rock! Alright, this place is freaky. Trees? Is there somebody in the trees? Come on out there, sir! I don't like that sound... A stick! [Reading] *branch snaps* It's broken! What the fook?! Okay, keep goin'! Keep goin'! That's scary! *nervous laugh* (what the shit?!) *snowy footstep* There was somebody there! Oh God! This is creepy! I don't like it! RUN LITTLE SAM! Ooh God, ooh God! *snowy footsteps* Uh oh! Uh oh, I can't move! UH OH! Run away from 'em! *footsteps* [Reading] [Meekly] Hiiiii... Shake his hand. *fart sound* (Good ol' Sansyboy!) *laughs* What the fuck? *laughs hard* [reading] Actually, no. I have to give him a good voice. What does his stuff sound like? He sounds like Patrick Star from like &quot;Spongebob.&quot; *really bad Patrick laugh* [like patrick] Well, ya found one. Yeah, he did. *laughs* No he didn't! There's a- it looks like there's a bar- oh no, there's not. I thought there was a bar missin', but it's the stump of the other tree behind it. Sweet! That was easy. *laughs* [reading] God, it is. It's exactly my shape, hair and all. &quot;sup, bro?&quot; Okay, what kinda voice do we give THIS guy? Uuum... I can't remember what his stuff sounds like, it's kinda higher-pitched. It a- he looks like a troll face! Or like, [like Skeletor] &quot;He he! What's up guys? He he!&quot; [A bad Skeletor impression] Is he like a stereotypical villian, like &quot;Hyaw, nuts! I coulda got away with it if it wasn't for those pesky kids!&quot; [READING] [laughing] &quot;Boondoggle?&quot; (strap yourselves in for all the bad puns) Go- good joke, bro... *buh dum tss* *laughing* Nice! *laughs* That's something I'd do in editing normally myself. &quot;SANS!!!&quot; Oh! Like comic sans? Oooh. If that is, then that's- that's clever. Oh, and he's papyrus. Like parchment, like paper to write on, he's comic sans. I get it...wait, Toriel wasn't anything... ( -_- *John Cena face* Are you sure about that?) [reading] I- I, oh! Ah, I was gonna say &quot;to the bone.&quot; *buh dum tss* *laughs* &quot;What up? What up?&quot; It's like [As Jimmy] &quot;Wow, wh-wh-what a terrific audience.&quot; [READING] *chuckles* Oh, these fuckin' guys! :) &quot;HEH!&quot; [laughing] What?! Oh, I love them! &quot;okay, you can come out now.&quot; Oh, I can move. Okay. Thanks. [reading] (God dammit) *giggles* [Oh, this lamp...] What about testicle rocks over here? They don't do anything. *tsk* Aw, this is your station thing. [Reading] Do you sell hot dogs? No, okay. [reading] Okay, I'm not sure about that voice for him. Cause his stuff is like [sounds kinda like Patrick's laugh], it's kinda in that range. Okay, I'll try and find the perfect voices for all these characters. I wanna go back and see if I can find him again. Actually, no, I don't, I don't care THAT much. *laughs* You have to go way, WAY back. Okay *sighs* um, please be a checkpoint up close. Aw yeah! Save point! (dat lamp) Save! Yeah! Okay! Well I'm gonna leave this episode here then. This game is AWESOME! I REALLY REALLY like this, it's super cool! The characters are really fun, I really like them, especially those last two guys! sans and Papyrus? Those are really cool guys, I like them a lot. Uuum, Toriel was really nice as well, and she's livin' all alone, back in the- in the underground area. :( Except fuck that flower dude! I hate that guy. Um, and I like the little battle system, and I like- and I'm gonna try and save everyone as much as I possibly can And I'm really sorry if I can't, or if something goes wrong, or- *tsk* well, I guess unless I fight them, like over and over and over again, I can't kill them accidentally all that much, so I'll see what happens. We- we'll go along. I think this series has some incredible potential because this is a- it's a really cool game, I really like the charactes, the music is FUCKIN' AWESOME Though I know the art style is very crude lookin', like the character herself is very- she's not that easy on the eyes to look at, she looks like a Simpson or somethin'. But, I guess that's just the way it is. I really like it though. Um, it's- it's a- it's one of the cooler games I've played lately! Well, so far anyway, I haven't played all that much. Um, but I'm always really anxious when I start a new series like this because I like- I don't know how long the game will be, I don't know how many episodes there're gonna be. Um, I'm gonna try to keep it *clears throat* to an hour each 'cause I feel like the people who're gonna like this series will watch the hour long episodes anyway, and they'll prefer it that way because you'll REALLY get into it that way and you keep the atmosphere a lot more. The people who don't like it then, they don't have to go through as much because the hour long videos will mean that it's less episodes overall so I think it's more of a win-win kinda thing, so I- HOPEFULLY you guys like it. I-I never know if people are gonna like these things and it's a REALLY big commitment to get into a new series every time and that's why I've like, put off some other games here and there but, I think this one should be fun! A lot of people were askin' for it in the comments and I've seen some REALLY great praise for this game all over the place, and I ca- I'm startin' to see why as well. So far, I really like it. But for now THANK you guys so much for watchin' this video. If you liked it, PUNCH that like button in the face... LIKE A BOSS! and high fives all around *WHOO-PEESH* *WHOO-PEESH* but THANK you guys, and I will see all you dudes.... IN THE NEXT VIDEOOOOOOOOOOO! hey! how do astronauts organize a...uh party, in space? they &quot;planet&quot; *awkward laughter*
