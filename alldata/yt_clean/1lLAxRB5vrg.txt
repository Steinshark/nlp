Hi, everyone! Today we're baking an &quot;Escimo cake&quot;. A very tasty cake. You've got an impression of having chocolate in it though there isn't. It's more tasty than &quot;Praque&quot;. Stay with me and let's bake it together. It's the quickiest recipe among all &quot;Eskimo&quot; variants. Heat the oven up to 356 F. The ingredients must have the same temperature... ... either a room temperature or they must be right from the fridge. Separate the egg white and the yolk of 4 eggs. I gonna beat the white and the yolk in two separate bowls at the same time. Send half of all sugar into the yolk the other one into the white. Keep on beating. Just look at my egg white! Fluffy egg white and the yolk should be a vanilla color. They should increase twice or three times in volume. Sugar will not completely dissolve. Send into the yolk 100 ml. of water. Stir it. While beating the white on slow rotation, add the yolk with water. Keep on beating until you get a homogenious mass. Sift flour, baking powder, cocoa. Mix it. The diameter of the baking form should be 22 cm. Cover the bottom of the baking form with the parchment paper. Send there the dough. Put the form into the preheated oven for about 30 min. Check it by piercing it with a wooden stick. While the cake is baking, we're cooking cream. Beat up by hand two eggs. I'm using a big frying pan b.c. it has a huge area. Add 1/2 of glass of sugar. 1/2 glass of condenced milk. ... vanilla, ... flour... Mix it up, kneading the dough Add milk part by part, kneading it. As soon as you've got a homogenious mass send the rest of the milk, stir it and switch on the cooker. Boil it on the slow or medium fire. As soon as it starts vapourating/boiling, I will reduce fire to the slowest and proceed stirring with a silicon spoon or a spatula. How to understand when you need to reduce fire??? Look, the cream on the bottom began to thicken. It's time to reduce the temperature and keep on boiling till it thickens. The cream is ready. It's homogenious. You may grind it by hand through the sieve or use the blender. Let the cream get cool. The butter should be soft. Later we'll beat up butter and cream. The sponge cake is ready. It needs to cool down well. Combine warm milk and sugar powder. Stir it. It'll be the cake impregnation. The cake is cold. Take it out of the form. Look at it! Divide the cake. It looks yummy! It's really &quot;wet&quot;. Apply impregnation... do not overdo it! If you're not a fan of &quot;wet&quot; cakes, omit impregnation. The sponge layers are wet enough by themselves. Beat up soft butter. Add cream spoon by spoon. Let's assamble the cake. Cover the wooden board with the parchment paper. Put on it the first, upper layer. Now you can operate one of these methods: Raise the paper from all sides on 2 cm. or use a confectionary circle. ... imprignation... Send cream. Some people put banana pieces before cream. Turn over the second sponge layer the way I do it. Make it the top of the cake. Adjust the parchment... Send it to the fridge for 2-3 hours. ... or for a night. Take off the parchment. Take a sharp knife. Cut it around. That's how it looks! Looks yummy! Put it aside and let's cook fondant. Two variants ar possible: ganache... ... it'll keep the shape of the cake but it's very sweet! So, there will be no balance as I see it. My choice is cocoa. I cook fondant, using cocoa and sour-cream. It's better to cover the cake with the fondant right before guests' comming. In this case the fondant will glitter and sparkle! But it's up to you! Act as you wish! My hasband Dima says: &quot; Olga, I want see chocolate stretching out while I'm cutting the cake! So, let's cook the fondant, using cocoa with its little spicy taste Take 3 spoons of cocoa ... sugar... some butter... ... sour-cream. Put it on fire. Stir it while it's melting. Look! The fondant got thick. I'll add some heat and turn it off as soon as I see first boiling bubbles. It starts steamming... When it's ready let it cool down. ... any method of cooling you choose. It should be a bit warm. Pour out the lighly warm glaze on the cake. Wait at least 5 min. When it gets stable I'll put the cake on the serving board. Let's cut it. All family is waiting! Look how marvelous it is! It's that tender! Cream is super! Chocolate sponge is wet you've got an impression that cake is full of chocolate! and the glaze... makes the cake gorgeous! It's very tastey! Very! Bake it, do! I'm waiting for your comments and feedbacks. Somebody! Try to bake with bananas! mummy... make I have some cakel...? ... mummy..., cake! Yummy!? We're going to drink tea and eat cake! Say: &quot;Bye&quot; to everyone! ... I wonna cake...!
