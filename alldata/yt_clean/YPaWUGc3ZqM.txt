All of these were the noun form. Now, of course, those are very simple statements, I like reading fiction in my free time. I enjoy taking pictures of nature in my leisure So you can use free time or leisure time. Both are acceptable. I would say free time is slightly more common. Playing piano is my favorite pastime, so using Playing piano is my favorite hobby, activity, And notice here I'm using a gerund statement. Playing piano that's a gerund statement. Playing piano is my favorite pastime. Instead of using the word pastime, you could the time, time, past time to past the time. They're the same meaning, just different structures. Now let me share some more advanced C1 phrases You will sound very advanced and professional The structure is to be an avid and then you So that's the noun form, and if you're an really love cycling. You could say I'm passionate about photography gerund verb.

It will not impact your experience as a tourist, in a way that a native speaker understands, just that. Let's do something different. Now you're going to learn natural phrases you're going to do that by listening to fast at the same time. Let's get started. Here's how this. Lesson will work. I'm going to say a sentence three times at down exactly what you hear in the comments. And the examples are going to go from beginner So let's see if you can complete this whole I'll say it three times. Thanks for your help, you rock. Thanks for your help. You rock.

She's starting to rub off on you. She's starting to rub off on you. Did you get this one? I said. She's starting to rub off on you. She's is our contraction. She is. She's. She's starting. To so instead of two. You can use an unstressed tub. She's starting to. Rub off because rub off is a phrasal verb. They go together. I can take that B sound and connect it to together. I have to say them as one word. Rub off, boff, rub off, rub off. I can also take that on and add it together, 3 words as. One rub off Fawn. So here I'm taking the F from off and I'm rub off on you what? Does this. Mean to rub off on someone is when someones Let's take Janice and let's say Janice loves Now let's say Fernando spends a week working other people. You could say Janice rubbed off on Fernando. Here we have it in the past. Simple. Rubbed, rubbed, rubbed. Off on Janice rubbed off on Fernando. Now, you could also take the specific personality helpfulness, which is a noun janice's helpfulness, so it's possessive Janice's helpfulness rubbed trait of Janice transferred to Fernando because Marcus is really rubbing off on you. Finally, I'm rubbing off on you. My deviousness has finally rubbed off on you. Let's try this again. I'll say it three times. He rubs me the wrong way. He rubs me the wrong way. He rubs me the wrong way. Did you get this one? I said he rubs me the wrong way. Notice this expression uses the verb. To. Rub and our last. Expression used. The verb to. Rub. But they have completely different meanings exercise. Because maybe you understood the words, but the wrong way. This is to annoy someone, but without intending Remember Janice from our last example. And she was very helpful, but maybe for some She annoys you, but there's nothing that she Just maybe your personalities clash, they So if you're planning a social. Gathering. You might say, is it OK if we don't invite She rubs me the wrong way. Now an entire person like poor Janice can something specific that someone said. Or did and overall you like? Janice, but just that one. Thing she said or did. Rubbed you the. Wrong way. For example, your comment just rubbed me the So maybe she said something in a meeting that intend to annoy you. So here your comment. This is a noun. Your comment rubbed the past Simple. Of the verb to rub and notice that soft D. Rubbed. Rubbed me, Rubbed me the wrong way. Absolutely. Wait, is it me? Like do I rub you the wrong way? Not Jay. Guy rubs me the wrong way. She rubs everyone the wrong way. But pop. Our final listening exercise and the most I'll say it three times. I had a hunch he'd quit. I had a hunch he'd quit. I had a hunch he'd quit. Did you get this one? I said I had a hunch he'd quit. Notice. For pronunciation, I had a. I had a had a, so I combine had a together I had a hunch he'd quit now. Did you hear that? Duh. He'd he'd quit. Well, that D represents what word would he He'd quit. He'd quit. Very difficult for students to hear native based on grammatical structure. It would sound awkward without it, so we know it. Either. When you have a hunch, A hunch is the noun, So to have a hunch, this is when you think But it isn't based on facts. It's based on your intuition, your feelings. So you could say. I have a hunch she'll accept our invitation All you would say is. Because I have a hunch, I have a feeling. I have a gut. Feeling and notice the grammar here. I have a hunch this is the present simple. And then she'll accept. She will accept. That's the future simple. I have a hunch she'll accept our invitation The future, but you could use this. In the past, like our listening exercise, In the past, So that's the past. Simple. Last week I had a hunch that he. Would quit, so would is the past simple of Will. I had a hunch that he'd quit, and using that Optional. You don't need it. You could simply. Say I had a hunch he'd quit. I had a hunch. Just a hunch. I had a hunch, but I wasn't certain.
