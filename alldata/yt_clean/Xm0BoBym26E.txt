[English subtitles are available.] Once upon a time, a magical beast went down from the heavens into the human world. Wherever it went, there would be abnormal phenomena in weather, and summer and winter exchanged. As it ran wild in the human world before the Spring Festival, it was named Nian. To bring peace to the human world, the Heavenly Court dispatched Rat Marshal and heavenly troops to tame it. After a fierce battle, Rat Marshal defeated the Nian. 200 Years Later The disaster was ended, and the human world regained peace. People celebrated peace, Nian and lively celebrate the Spring Festival every year. This is not right. Why doesn't grandpa's rod follow my order? I suggest you stop it. Xi. Only after you become a high-level immortal can you inherit Rat Marshal's rod. How can I become a high-level immortal? To do that, you have to catch the Nian in the human world. This is the Nian, an ancient magical beast formed on the aura of the heavens and earth. She lives in the depth of forests in mountains. When the atmosphere of the Spring Festival fades out, she'd come out and make trouble in the human world. She moves mysteriously and unpredictably, but she is afraid of fireworks. You can make use of this point, and brings her back to the Heavenly Court. Now the atmosphere of the Spring Festival in the human world is nearly gone. The Nian must be very ferocious. You want me to die? I won't do that. Don't be afraid. There is the Monster Binding String and a token of the Heavenly Court. The two tools can help you tame the Nian. You should have told me earlier. See you. Wait. You run away so quickly. I haven't finished. In broad daylight, and in the peaceful era, who did that? Just who did that? How many times did I tell you not to set off fireworks? Why did you go against it? I warn you for the last time today, don't set off fireworks. OK. You can go back home and wash your faces. The Spring Festival is around the corner. Remember to keep watch on the villagers, and forbid them to set off fireworks. Yes. Ouch. Where am I? Isn't it the 12th lunar month now in the human world? Why is it summer here? So smelly, so smelly. Nian. Don't come closer. I can defeat you. Wait. No. No, no. If I fail to catch the Nian, and she hurts humans because of me, not to mention to become a high-level immortal, I'm afraid I may be put into the heavenly prison. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Come, come, come. Bravo! Here. No. Look, these, these are longer. I'll throw them to the lion head, and scare them. OK. Bravo! Run! Run! Run! Run! Quick! Run! Quick! Leave those things there. Run! Leave them there. Run! Run! Quick! Run! Quick! Leave those things there. Run! Leave them there. Everyone, don't be afraid. Run! What's wrong? Why can't I use my arts? You went down so quickly before I could finish. You are a low-level immortal, so you can only use art once a day. Just now you used it in the forest, and of course now you can't use it anymore. You wretched Scroll, you should have told me that. I'll teach you a good lesson after I get back to the Heavenly Court. Help! Help! Help! Help! Chief. Let's go. Let's go. Take it. Take it. Monster, don't try to disturb the peace in our village. Go! Chuan. Let's go. Let's go. Watch out! Master! Master! Master! Father. It's all my fault. I shouldn't have come out. I'm fine. Pack our things, and go back home. Stop watching. Run! Oh no. The lion head. Chuan! Don't go. Come back! Master! Master! Hey. Wake up. Hey. Scroll, Scroll. He didn't wake up. What can I do? Try to hear his heartbeat. OK. I can't hear it. I hope he is still alive. What about breathing? You've woken up. See you. Wait. Rascal. I'm not a rascal. If you are not, why did you kiss me? Are you out of your mind? Tell me, who else did you kiss? Your head was wounded by the Nian? The Nian? What is that? Just the monster that took your lion head away. Right. My lion head. I need to get it back. Do you have a death wish? She eats humans. Which is more important, the lion head or your life? The lion head is very important, and I have to get it back. All right. Follow me. I know where she is. I won't follow you. Rascal. I'm not a rascal. I have a name, Xi. Hello, you rascal, Xi. I'm Luo Chuan. Why do you follow me? I don't. I also take this way. Don't follow me! I don't. Why are you still following me? IHuo Hui not. Why don't you ask anymore? You're mad. The Nian is very dangerous. In a while, you need to do as I say. We... Come back! Come back! Why did it turn into a little girl? Wu? What's funny about the fireworks? On the Eve of the Spring Festival, come and watch me dance lion dance. Wirewalking, grabbing the fire ball, and lion dancing, I guess you haven't seen these before. What's your name? You are Wu? Monster Binding String. You... The Nian ran away again. I used up my powers. Let me go back now. You can't get back to the Heavenly Court before you catch the Nian. Just try to make it. It's all your fault, so that I failed to catch the Nian. It's your fault. Why did you throw that string to her? I didn't get my lion head back. You did it intentionally. She was so fierce to me, but she treated you nicely. Tell me, are you accomplices? You irritated her, and of course she was fierce to you. I saw her at the entrance of the village. Her name is Wu. I didn't know that the Nian is a little girl. Why do you want to catch her? It's none of your business. You don't have any place to go? Not that. Anyway, because of you, I failed to catch the Nian. You hold responsibility to me. I don't! I'm going back home. Don't follow me. I'm not. Don't follow me. I'm not. Wait for me! Don't follow me. Slow down. Didn't you say that you are not following me? I'm not. This shabby robe makes me itch. You should be thankful. This shabby robe cost all my lucky money last year. That's because you stained my clothes. That's because you follow me. Your place is so dilapidated. I don't want to follow you. You can leave. Don't follow me. I won't leave you. Dad. Dad. How are you? I'm fine. Didn't you go to look for the lion head? Where is it? It's missing. It's missing, and just let it go. It's fine as long as you are back. I hope everything else will be fine. I want to celebrate the Spring Festival with you safely. Who is that girl? I picked her on the way. You are so rude. She isn't a thing that could be picked. I, I'm from a neighboring village. Our village was destroyed by monsters. I don't have anywhere to go. If so, you can stay in our place. Thank you, Mr. Luo. I learned some skills to cure patients from my parents. Maybe I can cure you. But you need to close your eyes first. OK. I didn't expect that you could practice medicine. Thank you. I told you not to look down on me. What, what do you want to do? Are you a monster? Why was there a beam of golden light just now? I saw it. I'm not a monster. You are not a monster? How can you prove it? Look, I'm an immortal. I'm also an immortal. I'm really an immortal I'm a lion dance immortal. Look, this is my tail. Rat immortals like me have a tail. Now you believe it? I was just joking. You are so pretty, and of course you are an immortal. Thank you for having cured my father. Or I didn't know what to do. So you owe me from now on. From today on, I'll protect you. Who needs your protection? Listen, the fact that you are an immortal can't be revealed to Panshui, or all others in the village will come and watch us. I'm a jinx, and you are a rat immortal. This can be their topic for a year. Who is she? Xi. She lost contact with her family, and she is going to live with us for several days. I'm going to tell master about it. My dad met her. She cured dad. Err, nice to meet you. Are you okay, Panshan? I'm fine. Who is she? Let me introduce for you. She is Xi. This is my... Xi, hello. Nice to meet you. Please forgive me for having not welcomed you outside. Right. I, I'm Gu Panshan. Err... Where are you from? I'm from a neighboring village. Our village was destroyed by monsters. I don't have anywhere to go. So Luo Chuan brought me here. Well, Xi, don't worry. I'll take my fellows to help you find your parents. Thank you very much. Well, sit. Monster? I think you are like a monster. What's that nonsense? Go do your work. What are these? We dance lion dance. These are props for lion dance. You haven't watched lion dance before? No. I can dance for you. OK. I'll play the lion head. Wow! Amazing! How was it? Good? It was wonderful. Thank you. I'm a little hungry. Wait for a second. We don't have any delicious food at home. Err, I bought these at the fair. Eat. Didn't you buy these for me? She is our guest. Panshan. I rarely saw you like this. Stop that nonsense. Panshui. You like them? Enjoy. We need to hurry up and rehearse. My dad just recovered, and he can't dance lion dance. This year on the Eve of the Spring Festival, the three of us have to do it. No. We lost the lion head. How can we rehearse? A slim donkey has a pile of hard shit. It's not something you can do. You think you could do it? Why didn't you go chase it? You already chased. Why should I do that? Did you get the lion head back? No. You lost the lion head, and brought a monster back. No wonder you are called a jinx. I'm not a jinx. You are! I'm not! If you are not, who else is? I'm not! They are good? I'm not! Why are you quarreling? Go to sleep. Ancestor. Ancestor. For decades, I've been doing as you say. I take away all fireworks in the village, forbid all the villagers to make loud noise, and even the lion dance troupe takes my advice, and won't make a big show. Our Hujiazhuang should have always been safe. But, but why did the monster show up? I shed tears looking at the village, and regret a lot. I... Ancestor? Ancestor? Why don't you say anything? Until you finish it. I'll shut up, and follow your instructions. What, what is this? The abnormal phenomena in weather and hotness in winter in Hujiazhuang are ominous, and they are caused by the Nian that showed up today. The Nian shows up around the Spring Festival and does evil things in the human world. If you want to protect the village and defeat the Nian, you need to do as I say, and practice the Monster Pacifying Art. The Monster Pacifying Art? To practice the Monster Pacifying Art, you need to put your hand here to get connected with me. Then I can help you. Why are you here? Chief, Luo Chuan brought a girl back home yesterday. I think she isn't from the locality. The problem is that the girl has a tail, and she didn't explain things clearly. There must be something wrong with her. A girl with a tail? It's not peaceful now. Why did this girl come here? I hope she isn't a monster? Yeah, yeah. I think she is a monster. Panshan is nearly obsessive. Keep watch on them. If anything happens, report to me. OK. Go. Xi. We just have some homely food. I'm not sure whether you like it or not. Thank you, Mr. Luo. Xi. Taste this. I made it. It tastes very good. Why didn't you pick some food for me? She is our guest. Here. Taste it. Eat this. How did you meet Chuan? This also tastes good. Stop talking. Just eat. Did I ask you? What's your relationship with her? It's none of your business. Here is the thing. When we went to catch the Nian, he was kicked into a coma by the Nian, and he lay in my bosom. Then... No, no, no. He was kicked into a coma? He lay in your bosom? No. We... That's right. We were... No need to explain it. Luo Chuan has never brought any girl back. Why did he bring you back? You think I don't know it? Tell me, do you want to be a member of our lion dance troupe? The Luo lion dance skills are only passed down to males, rather than females. Quit that idea. No, I don't want that. I don't want to dance lion dance with you. All right. Stop quarrelling. You and Chuan, don't go to the town these days, or Hu Changli may come and find fault with us. After you help Xi find her parents, come back and celebrate the Spring Festival. Why can't he go to the town? When he goes to the town, all other villagers will meet trouble. That's nonsense. Eat. Is it nonsense? The lion head from your mother had been weirdly changed by you, and now it's lost. We all have bad luck because of you. Jinx. Wait and see. I'm going to get the lion head back. Chuan! You were talking nonsense. Horse stance. How can you be so childish? Which is more important, your life or the lion head? Mom left it to me. I must get it back. If mom were still alive, she wouldn't let you take the risk. You didn't know anything about her, or about me. Only mom supported to me dance the new lion dance. You are afraid of anything, and don't allow me to do anything. You are a coward. This place is gorgeous. If you like this place, I'll bring you here every day You, don't be mad. Your dad just wants you to be safe. I'm different from you. Actually, no one cares about me. Where are your parents? They passed away a long time ago. After my grandpa passed away, no one protects me. They look down on me because I'm a low-level rat immortal, and they push me aside in everything. So I have to catch Wu to become a high-level immortal and prove myself to them. It's also so difficult to be an immortal. Of course. Not to mention to inherit the rod. Anyway, I must catch Wu as soon as possible. I can't let her make trouble in the human world anymore. How can you catch her? In the forest, I saw that she didn't want to hurt you. Since you want to get the lion head back, and I need to catch Wu, why not do it together? She seems to like watching lion dance very much. Let's go back and get the props of lion dance. Maybe we can make it. But I need to tell you this first. If she gets angry, we need to run away immediately. We can't stay there for even just a moment. OK. Luo Chuan. Let's go. Scissors rock paper. Scissors rock paper. I won. Scissors rock paper. Another round, another round. Scissors rock paper. Why did you win again? Scissors rock paper. Scissors rock paper. Scissors rock paper. Scissors rock paper. I won. Scissors rock paper. Another round. Scissors rock paper. Scissors rock paper. The Monster Pacifying Art is really awesome. It can pacify monsters. It's so easy to control humans with it. You went against my orders, but now you are under my control. Go, and tell all others that if they catch the Nian with me, I'll reward them, but if they go against my orders, I'll punish the Nian and them. Chief. It's me. Chief. Luo Chuan left with the female monster. They might go to look for the Nian. The Nian? She is over there. In a while if Wu gets mad, don't fight her. Let me handle her. Why do you look at me? You're so worried about me. Do you have feelings for me? Of course not. Jinx. Stay here and don't move. I'll go deal with her. Come. Come. Wu. She is Xi. She isn't evil. Right. Wu. I'm Xi. How about going back to the Heavenly Court with me? That's your home. You see, you are very dangerous wandering here. Xi will take you back to the Heavenly Court, and you'll be under good care. No one will bully you there. Wu. We are really flying. It's pretty, right? Is that my home? Yeah. It's Hujiazhuang there. Be careful. Awesome, right? I can fly! I could fly long ago. You are really stupid. Don't touch me. Look. It's our home ahead. There is a waterfall over there. It's pretty, right? The human world is gorgeous. Luo Chuan. I'm so glad to have met you. I'll tell others that Wu can be our friend. What if she gets terrified and loses control of herself again? You can handle it, right? Master. Master. Did you find Chuan? I searched everywhere, but didn't find him. Where did he go? Luo. Luo. Luo. Go and gather at the entrance of the village. Chief tells us to catch the Nian. To catch the Nian? Master. Will we give the performance tonight? Take our things, and go to search for Chuan with me. OK. Where is Panshui? Chief? Why did you become like this? Give the monster to me. No, no, no. She isn't a monster. She won't hurt us. What you say is heretic, you are heretic. You made friends with a monster. Luo Chuan, today you and the monster will die. Watch out! Wu! Wu! Wu! Wu! You're really a monster. Wu! I'll also kill you today. Take her away now. I'll fight him. I won't go. I can't leave you alone here. Go now. When my powers are exhausted, I can't delay him. Do you want to see more people get hurt? Dad. Dad! Oh dear. Chuan. You are finally back. Where, where is Xi? Xi, Xi went back home. Who is this kid? How did she get hurt? She is Wu. Panshan, go fetch some water. OK. Wu! Wu! Wu! Good girl. Drink some water. Yeah. Xi! Xi! Pack your things now. Are you okay? I'm fine. Where is Hu Changli? I don't know what demonic art Hu Changli practiced, and he has become demonic. Just what is happening? Panshui? Panshui? Where is Panshui? He was home a moment ago. I don't know where he is now. Go find him. My powers can resist him for long. It'll be too late if we wait for him. Pack things now. Quick, quick. Pack our things. Quick. Let's go. Yes, go find him. Let's go. Go find him. Why are you here? Master. Stay away from her. She is a monster. She colludes with the Nian. How can it be possible that she is a monster? Chief told me that. Master. Don't be tricked by her. Panshui, you're talking nonsense. Everyone, we have to go now. Chief practiced demonic art, and he got insane. He'll soon come back to the village. He'll hurt us. How can it be possible? Chief got insane? I think Luo Chuan is insane. He is with that monster. This girl looks innocent, but she is actually a monster. Monster? I'm not a monster. I, I am... Master. Chuan lied to us. This Xi isn't a human. She is a monster. I saw her tail. You said that you are not a monster, but what are you? Tell us. Tell us. Just what are you? Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! I, I'm... Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! Go, go, go. Come on, Yong. Quick. Here. Come on. This way. Remove it. You see? This. Light it. Light it. Come, come, come. Run! Run! Wu! Wu! Are you all right? Wu! Monster. Monster. Give the monster to us. Wu! I'm here. No one can hurt you. Just fireworks. Don't be afraid. How can you still protect the monster? You brought the Nian here. You even blamed Chief. It's him! Listen to me. Don't say anything. Monster. Wu transformed because she got afraid. She isn't evil. She can be our friend. If you don't believe it, you can ask my dad. Err... Wu isn't evil. She is very timid. Don't scare her anymore. You are heretic. The hot weather in winter in our village is an omen. That's because of you. Give the Nian to us. Get out of Hujiazhuang. Give it to us! Get out of Hujiazhuang! Give it to us! Give it to us! Give it to us! Give the Nian to us! Give it to us! Give the Nian to us! Give it to us! Give the Nian to us! Chief. Chief came. My family has protected the village for generations. With the only hope of everyone living an affluent life, we've been working hard out of forests in mountains. He is insane. He's still so particular about wording when he is insane. But you always go against me and the whole village. The lion head. Give the monster to me, or... Dad, say something. Wu won't hurt people. She is a kid. Give her to us. Dad. She is a monster. You want us to be driven out of the village because of her? Dad. How can you be so cruel? Give it to us! Wu, Wu. What's wrong with you? It's me. You don't know me? Chuan! Xi. Xi. Wake up. Xi. The female monster is practicing some art. The female monster is practicing some art. Look. The female monster is practicing some art. She is practicing some art. Release her. She is just a little girl. Don't hurt her. The Nian caused damages to our village. I'm going to sacrifice it to worship the heavens tonight, so as to pray for peace of our village in the coming year. Xi, Xi. Are, are you really a monster? I'm not a monster. I, I'm a rat immortal in the Heavenly Court. I came down to catch the Nian, but I don't know why it became like this. Xi. We misunderstood you. Mr. Hu. Mr. Hu. What's wrong with you, Mr. Hu? Go pack our things in the backyard. Since we found the lion head, there is nothing we like here. HavenHuo Zhua you always wanted to leave? We'll leave tonight. Dad. Where can we go now? Let's go. Let's leave this place. We don't need to face those people that judge us. If mom were still alive, she wouldn't want to see what you've suffered. I can't do anything but dance lion dance in my life. I only hope that you can achieve something, be safe, and do things you want. If I'm away, you can live a better life, can't you? That's nonsense, Chuan. Mom passed away. I make dad mad every day, and you and Panshui get in trouble because of me. How can I be so annoying? What are you thinking? Listen, master has never been annoyed, neither have us. Chuan. Do you remember that day when you left home? I went to master's room to do the cleaning, and I saw him making a small lion head for you. Wu is a monster. Why did I trust her? I thought I could understand her. Having grown to this age, I hate celebrating the Spring Festival for the first time. After the Spring Festival, I'm one year older. Can I let go of what have happened? Will things suck on the Spring Festival every year just like this year after I come of age? Or can I do things I want after I grow up as dad said? I don't know that. But I think those grown-ups were also having a hard time. They took orders from Chief, and they got so angry with purple eyes. But they didn't dare to say anything. Their eyes were purple? Yeah. I heard that they needed to help Chief build an ancestral temple, and there was an amulet on each of them. They were so tired that their eyes were purple. It was like that they were bewitched. They were much like Wu today. Why were they bewitched? I know it, Panshan. What do you know? Go. Xi. I know why Wu got insane. Why? Panshan said that all other villagers' eyes turned purple. Yeah. I wonder if Chief has practiced some demonic art and controlled all others, as well as Wu. Let me ask the Heavenly Court. They may know it. Scroll, Scroll. Come quickly. What for? Did you catch the Nian? Not yet. She was taken away by someone. Do you want to become a high-level immortal? Help me find out if there is some demonic art that can control humans' minds and the Nian. Yeah. You are exhausting me. Is, is, isn't this the art Hu Changli practiced? Yeah, yeah. I didn't expect that the dangerous Monster Pacifying Art is still practiced in the human world. The Monster Pacifying Art? Yeah. Many years ago a semi-human semi-monster developed the Monster Pacifying Art to catch monsters, but he became demonic, and transformed into the Soul Eating Monster. It had no body or shadow, and just existed as a puff of purple smoke, but it integrated greed, pain, resentment and viciousness. It wandered around, and later it occupied the Nian's body, so that the Nian lost control, got insane, and made a mess in the human world. But according to records, back then when Rat Marshal tamed the Nian, he destroyed the Soul Eating Monster. But why did it show up again? So what the Soul Eating Monster wants is to occupy Wu's body. How can we defeat it? According to books, you have to drive the Soul Eating Monster out of the body it has occupied, and wake up the person that has practiced the demonic art. But as to what you need to do after you wake him up, I don't know that, either. It depends on you. I'll go get a drink. Don't call me for anything. You... Wait. Immortal, how can you drink wine as a scroll? That's an excuse. Hey. You haven't finished it. Why do you always not tell me all the things? Will we put an end to this after we wake up Chief and destroy the Soul Eating Monster? We have to save Wu before the Soul Eating Monster occupies her body. I'll go with you. I'll also go with you. Wu. Wu. See who we are. Wu. Wu. Wu. You don't know us? What's wrong? Hu Changli is too powerful. I can't open it, either. Panshui? Chief. Do you know what these are? Are you okay? Go now. I can handle him. Take care. Be careful. Come, Chief. Wu. Come on. Let's go. Chief. I'm here. What's happening? What is Chief doing? Wu. Wu. Look, what is this? How can it be possible? Wu. Wu, look. Xi. Give the lion head to me. Panshui? Go on. OK. Wu, you don't remember this? This is your favorite lion dance. Wu. Wu. Wu. Wu. Wu. OK, OK. Don't be afraid. It's been the past. Don't be afraid. Wu. Go, go Have a look. I found that all others have become sober. Everyone, don't be afraid. Wu is the Nian, but she doesn't want to hurt anyone. She can understand my lion dance, and she can make friends with you. What drove her insane was the Soul Eating Monster in Chief's body. Xi. The token said that the Soul Eating Monster isn't scary, and what's important is that we have to wake Chief up, right? Yeah. I found that Chief seemed to be afraid of fireworks. Right. He suffers neurasthenia, and is afraid of noise. We can wake him up with fireworks. Good idea. Go, go, go. This way. Go with Panshan and Panshui. In a while, you put fireworks at the roofs and eaves. I'll bring Chief here, and then you set off them. OK. This way. Come on. Let's go. Scatter. Come. Throw fireworks to him. Set off fireworks. Throw fireworks to him. Throw fireworks to him. Throw fireworks to him. Throw fireworks to him. Throw fireworks to him. Throw fireworks to him. I've planned with carefulness for 200 years. I waited for the re-emergence of the Nian, so that I could occupy her body, and regain my powers. Unexpectedly, you fools ruined my plan. You won't make it! You can't. I won't allow you to hurt others. You think you can do that? Watch this. Ancestor, what are you doing? Who is your ancestor? Shut up, you fool. I thought you, the incarnation of Howling Celestial Dog, could help me. But unexpectedly, you are good for nothing. Now I have to deal with it myself. Chuan! Chuan! Xi. You naive brat. Now, all others disdain you. But you want to protect the Nian. No matter what people think of Wu or me, I will do what I've decided. Only a person can decide what I do, that is, myself. For people controlled by me, their souls are also mine. No one can be themselves. Go to hell and be yourself. Don't try to trick me with your minor skills. Your world is hypocritical, and I've seen too many of these deceptive tricks by you timid humans. Go to hell! I'm not those people. As long as I march forward, I can move closer to be the person I want to be. You are doomed. Now you still fight me. If I can be myself, I'm willing to do this. Come, come, come. Come. Everyone, come. Everyone, come. Quick, quick. We won! We won! Great! We won! We won! Great, Wu. We won. Luo Chuan, you are awesome. Chief. Take care. Take care. Take care. Take care. Take care. Take care. What's wrong? The life is like a dream. There are so many obstacles in it. I love my village so deeply, but I was tricked by the monster, misled, and caused this disaster. It's fine. It's been the past. Quick. Help Chief go back. Chief. Chief. Chief, take care. Help Chief go back. Let me help you go back. I regret it. Take care, Chief. Chief, take care. Let's go. Well, go back home and rest. Let's go. Let's go. Thank you for everything today. I seem to see this gem somewhere. My mom picked this up in the suburbs when she planned to make a lion head for me. Oh right. 200 years ago, my grandpa came down to the human world to catch the Nian. A piece of his rod broke off. This gem is that piece from the rod. So your grandpa has been protecting you. The lion head your mom made saved all of us. She has never left, and been protecting you by your side. Chuan. Keep the lion head well, and dance the lion dance. From today on, I won't miss any of your performances. Dad! Brat. Right. It's the 1st day of the 1st lunar month tomorrow. Go to the temple fair with us. Yeah. Go there with us. It'll be very lively. Yeah. Yeah. Wu can't stay here for long. I, I need to take her back as soon as possible. Xi, you suffered a lot with us in the human world. After you go back to the Heavenly Court, have some rest and cure your wounds. OK. Chuan, Xi is going back. I don't allow you to go. If you leave, you'll never come back. What are you saying? How can I do that? I promise you. On the Spring Festival every year, I'll come with Wu. OK? OK. Next time when you come back, you can't kiss others. I can't promise that. Jinx. Wu, after going back to the Heavenly Court, do as Xi says, remember that, OK? I'm so glad to have met you. Xi. You are the best immortal I've met. See you next year. Panshui. Go ahead. Thank you for having saved Wu and me. You're welcome. Sweep the floor for me later. Where did you go after we got back home? How did you know that we were in danger? Is there anything I don't know in the world? I could even tell that Xi isn't a human. It was a piece of cake to save you. All right. Don't cause any trouble to me in the future. I don't want to clean up the mess for you. Who asked you to do that? I cleaned up the mess. Who asked you to do that? Brats. Horse stance. It's all your fault. It's all your fault. Horse stance. Yes, yes. Quick. Horse stance. Dad! Mom! Come. It's snowing. It's snowing. What's up? It's snowing. Look. It's snowing. It's really snowing. I'll go fetch the spring couplet. It's the Spring Festival! It's the Spring Festival! You are so happy. It's snowing. It's the Spring Festival! Let me help. It's the Spring Festival! Greetings, master. OK. Be good men, dance lion dance carefully, and carry forward the authentic skills of the Luo lion dance. Thank you, master. Here. Take the clothes. Thank you. The Nian comes down to the human world before the Eve of the Spring Festival. She is afraid of fireworks. When she gets terrified, she'd transform into a ferocious beast. But in ordinary times, she is a five-year-old girl. She likes watching lion dance. If necessary, lion dance can be used to comfort her, rather than the Monster Pacifying Art. The Monster Pacifying Art is demonic. To protect the village, I was tricked by it, and caused a disaster. Only upright and brave people can protect our homeland. Happy Spring Festival. Chief, happy Spring Festival. Come with us and watch lion dance. Yeah. Come with us and watch lion dance. I feel so ashamed meeting others. So I'd better stay at home and do reflection, rather than drive others mad outside. Chief. Chief. It's the Spring Festival. Why do you confine yourself here? Let's go. Come with us. Let's go. OK, OK.
