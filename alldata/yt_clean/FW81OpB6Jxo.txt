[Ja] (laughing) &quot;But it was [Ja] &quot;But it was actually a weddin'!&quot; [A] This is a hotly disputed, uh, situation amongst our group. [A] Half of us believe we saw a leopard, [A] But it's because it was in a bush, and it was kind of - [A] Like, that's what they do! [A] We had binoculars. [Ja] Don't judge them like that. [Ja] That's a stereotype. [Ja] When you say &quot;that's [Ja] &quot;Those&quot; big cats? [Jo] It's how they drive.

Mix it up a 'Cause I was mostly in Brooklyn, 'cause not only was in Brooklyn, but... Russell stays in Brooklyn-- Russell who has been on Sad Boyz: Nightz. - You know, my...

We did get-- We got tests and everything, and then I sort of Aside from these sweatpants. Yeah. No, we have everything else. And I've been... basically got a million and I just won't stop wearing it. I just love that it's, um... It's a good thing for Relaxing. I mean, I am at a tricky point now, where-- It's very rare that sweatpants are long enough for my legs, Then I have the T-shirt, which I always have It's long enough for my torso. And then... - It's a lanky function. &quot;The T-shirt fits my weird body.&quot; [Jo] But then we made sure that you know, my favorite kind, 'cause there's just a certain especially when my hair's and that's happening right now. And I did go to the local coffee shop, and I was wearing three pieces-- Oh! I might be a redneck. (Anastasia laughs) [Jo] (Southern accent) I went - [Ja] (laughs) OK.

[Jo] Brought this sweater today. [Jo] I was like, &quot;Did we pick this up?&quot; - [Jo] She left this at my place. [Jo] I went to the 313, and it was - [Jo] Just a trip to see Katie's family. [Jo] I Mich-agained, and [Jo] No, it was really nice. It's not... [Jo] It's I think maybe been on a plane for [Jo] And it was... it did deafen me. [Jo] The air pressure, for whatever [Jo] We talked about it pre-show, [Jo] So, apologies to the audience if, or have to ask for clarification. in case you have to cut out I'm elderly!&quot; [Jo] &quot;I do declare! It was really surreal, because I felt at times just very not on top of things I was. You know, I didn't have my laptop with me. I was a little, like, not being Hey, kudos to not bringing your laptop. - Yeah. [Jo] Couldn't log into Archidekt [Ja] Never mind. Big mistake. [Ja] One thing I've noticed about life, [Ja] Whether I'm putting on - Putting them back on. - [Jo] Keep them on now. You're in public. [Ja] And fit is also important when it You shouldn't have to compromise when you're searching for a [Ja] And you don't have to, [Ja] Zocdoc is a free app and website that allows you to search and that fit your specific needs and click to instantly We're talking about more than 100,000 healthcare [Ja] From mental health to you can filter for doctors who take who can fit any specific and are highly-rated You can also see their select a time that works for you, [Ja] Plus Zocdoc appointments happen fast, typically within just and you can even score the [Ja] This is a utility, right?

[Jo] Two important One... On the way out, me and download a bunch of episodes of One AirPod each, right? One, I think, very cool, down-to-earth, regular we went on a fishing trip. Went out, technically, so apologies. Is that allowed? Lock me up. (chuckles) I'm in trouble? Maybe. - Check. Check? Oh, no. Had to get a day license, so and so. It was really fun. We got some hooters. We caught a couple bangers. I... am proud of that. One thing I'm not as proud of... [Jo] I have been fighting [Jo] And there is nothing... that frustrates me more... than someone telling [Jo] You know? &quot;You have to [Ja] Right. [Jo] Let alone the - telling me I had to do that. [Jo] Me refusing... [Ja] You're talking about the - [Jo] Yeah. &quot;No!&quot; - [Jo] &quot;That's not where the door is.&quot; [Jo] &quot;I'll watch it if you let me [Ja] &quot;Now, I'm the and I'm here to tell you We make planes, and they [Jo] &quot;They ain't gon' fly off-- &quot;Now, go ahead and have a good time, and be nice to our staff, 'cause - (laughs) Have you seen those videos? I feel like I've lived through different Delta CEOs, &quot;Uh, we're a good ol' family business [Ja] OK, no, but what [Jo] I got into Doctor Who. - [Ja] Ohhhhh! - [Jo] We, as a collective, me and Katie. [Jo] (sighing) I know. [Jo] Specifically, got into the [Ja] Oh, 'cause Capaldi joined after... - It was after Tennant. Or... - [Jo] Oh, Matt Smith. Sorry. The last I had watched was I've always been a little 'cause my mum always hated it, and I always kinda hated elements of it. And then the culture and then it became very And part of it was, &quot;Girls watch this. I don't watch stuff for girls. [Ja] &quot;Why doesn't he say who he is? What do you mean, &quot;Doctor Why Are You Being Like This?&quot; But I watched it. Certainly, there's little bits I found the Matt Smith I like Matt Smith as a performer. It was very &quot;le epic win bacon,&quot; &quot;Erm, I'm putting on a fez!&quot; - Like, I couldn't handle it. - The Capaldi shit is so fucking good. We only watched the follow-up season, 'cause... I don't know. We were and Katie hadn't seen any of it. Genuinely, I think, really good. It's not perfect, and it gets a little... I never enjoyed any of the... When I had seen episodes in the past-- It's like we had to 'cause it's what's happening. I... had seen maybe half of... Eccleston through Tennant. And I... I've never been a What's the word? Uh, lore element, where it's like, &quot;We're and it all links in together.&quot; It's nothing set up prior; it's I'm like, &quot;I like these...&quot; What I respect so much about is that it's almost like a great sketch, where they're taking an idea-- a really creative, really weird idea-- and burning it, and just saying, &quot;We're doing this in 40 minutes. We could Nope. Great premise. Done. Gone. And then they There's a huge arc of that I was like, &quot;I just don't care.&quot; Like, the last three episodes are... fine. But then that, like... Peter Capaldi, dude. [Jo] It was really fun, 'cause we've talked in the we kinda lied in school or whatever, [Jo] I'm like, &quot;What is this--&quot; [Jo] It's very easy, and to critique things like Some of the more toxic [Jo] For some reason, 'til very recently, &quot;authenticity&quot; or as a similar holding myself back from enjoying things. [Jo] Like... [Jo] Well, I've been in - [Ja] Mmhmm. very self-conscious or missing certain things [Jo] There's these things stick in, [Jo] It's for a fictional version - that's mean to me about it. [Jo] I feel the exact wearing certain things, even having certain types of... Like, my hair length, Having it at &quot;can I that's like a rational-- But they don't do that anymore, not here. [Jo] I felt so self-conscious about just watching Doctor Who [Jo] And we had a good time [Jo] Come on, now. - [Jo] Now--psych! Uh... - [Jo] I do just--I don't know, like... - (Anastasia laughs) - [Ja] I just wanna talk. [Jo] But I don't know, I kinda is there anything that you feel like, to enjoy, or at least... not judge others or push others on? Well, the first thing that came to Because I, uh-- When that was airing, like, - I was working in tech. And so everybody was And I was like, &quot;I don't wanna go...&quot; Like, go home from my job, and then - (laughs) Yeah. It's not the type of parody that's like... It's a little bit too real, actually. You know? And I watched the first episode Um... Uh, with a friend, and... Like, I don't know why. I think they... brought it up, or it came up on [Ja] And I was right to avoid it. (laughs) [Ja] It is exactly what I thought it was. [Ja] And it is just a series of [Ja] Like, every single something that I'm like, &quot;Ah! Ah!&quot; [Jo] Is it at least sort of [Ja] Yeah. Yeah, and... you know, very talented writers, [Ja] It's just that that, um, the actual, like, construction of the show is almost--it feels like a... It's like a... It's more... Like, if someone who - watches The Office... they don't go, &quot;Ugh, 'cause they barely ever talk - Yeah, it's a framing device. is about technology and about, you know, math and about nerds and about CEOs and about the exorbitant It opens on a Kid Rock concert into somebody talking about and these are just things It's not even a joke at that point, The tech industry is a parody of itself. I find the aesthetics It gave me a smell of the office. Like, not the show, - You know, we both liked working there. It is just like a, uh... You know, the final office before we left, walking into that building, It had like a cleanliness, And I would walk in Like, &quot;Now I've shifted. I'm swearing less. I'm at work.&quot; And there's just something 'Cause I also never I would try watching it and go, Because of how they like, Mike Judge... did a lot of walkthroughs And one of those people was, uh... like, Yelp and Jeremy So, not only had Mike Judge after doing that show, and that is why it hits too close to home, there's also stories taken - [Jo] That's weird. Like, there's I don't actually know, but I heard that there's a thing about someone changing the Uh, and that was a thing that actually happened at our work. Specifically, I know who [Jo] And there was drama. Just the hoops that There wasn't as much drama as but just things like that, it's like it feels more like... - not entertainment. It's like the psychic damage to, like, sort of professional [Jo] I'm imagining a world where and there's an entire season arc about rebranding the Redoing all the copy on a certain website we I don't know, eight months of my life. [Ja] What's that movie, The Proposal? - [Jo] Is that the Ryan Reynolds one? [Jo] And he's being [Ja] Exactly. That movie, uh... has so much stuff that I was like... [Ja] We also watched that movie, and triggering actual real-life experiences,&quot; 'cause there's so many scenes - with immigration lawyers. [Ja] And I'm just like, I just don't--every time I've seen &quot;This is exactly the same You're always doing this. You're always like, - [Ja] Right. - or whatever happens in the stupid movie. So, real quick, I'll get into So, I almost missed Uh, and I was like... early to the flight, But I think that I was too late to check a bag, and... Uh, I... I actually brought my big suitcase, because I thought And I put my small suitcase and just checked that. And so when I went back, I didn't end up I had my small suitcase and I was gonna check that again. like clothes or whatever, that was around my small suitcase. And so when I get there... I first try to do the expedited, uh, you actually pay, 'cause it's curbside to put your bags on the plane. I knew I was running And the person was I was like, &quot;Sorry; what?&quot; They just weren't giving And then I was like, &quot;OK,&quot; and I went inside and But instead I went to So, rookie mistake. [Jo] &quot;I don't need [Ja] So I went to the &quot;Yeah, no. It's closed. But maybe you can go to the help desk.&quot; - [Jo] &quot;I cannot help you, unfortunately.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Oh, so 'cause all the bag drop and-- When I see a big bag drop area I assume that that's the help desk also. More often than not, [Ja] And they're like, In the moment, I'm in a bit of a rush, so I don't have time to think about it, 'Cause everybody's just sitting OK, whatever,&quot; and then I keep going. I don't even wanna name the airline, [Jo] Let's just call it Like &quot;Delta Airlines.&quot; That's a Don't worry. It's not actually Delta. &quot;Here at Delta, we...&quot; Um, but anyway. So then I go down to the help desk. [Ja] I get in line, and getting-- [Ja] I think one of the is when you're in a rush and [Ja] It creates maybe human psychological [Jo] Like Stanford prison experiment, - [Ja] Yeah. and you know when you stop [Ja] And they're all watching a long rope, a long fuse to a bomb, sort of like in a cartoon, just running, and they're like, &quot;The fucking I need to get through this line.&quot; [Ja] I get to the, um... the front, finally. By the way, there's a few people who are in [Ja] There's on the order in exactly my situation so I wonder if they just [Ja] 'Cause we were all [Jo] Did you end up all waiting around? [Ja] Well, we were sitting in [Ja] So I finally get up to the help desk, [Ja] And then they're like... - (weakly) &quot;Yeah, it's too late to...&quot; [Ja] &quot;It's too late to do it.&quot; [Ja] &quot;Yeah, you're [Ja] It's like, &quot;But the flight's [Ja] And I'm like, &quot;The flight &quot;Yeah, so if you don't check the bag...&quot; &quot;So if I don't check the bag, I can go?&quot; [Ja] And it's like, &quot;Yeah, [Ja] &quot;So you're saying if I don't [Ja] And they're like, &quot;I suppose so, [Jo] Well, that would be 'cause that's information. [Ja] So I was caught in a loop, [Ja] And then, uh... [Ja] And all these people are [Jo] It's the infrastructure that sucks. [Ja] And that's, again, why because I just don't [Ja] I just wanna tell this story [Ja] And it's also like I should've [Ja] Um, and everything's fine. [Ja] And I could've even called, like, the travel agency help line if I was really in a pinch, but... [Ja] You know the situation, like, I don't wanna inconvenience anybody. [Ja] The travel agency, 'cause [Ja] And, um... [Ja] So then--but I never [Ja] I probably would've rather paid out [Ja] Anyway, I'm like, and I can probably make it,&quot; 'cause I also have pre-check, so I should be able to get I opened up my big bag, and I was like, &quot;How can I stuff in the small bag Like, stuffing it. Like... Uh, with no abandon. And then I'm trying to make all like, &quot;I hope nothing So I'm just stuffing things. And then I overfill &quot;I don't know how to So then I start sitting on my suitcase. I'm kinda bouncing-- (laughs) I'm bouncin' on it. Cowboy, of sorts? [Ja] I'm sitting on my and it's starting to [Ja] And it's a hard-shell suitcase. [Ja] And eventually, I get it zipped. [Ja] It's so funny. [Ja] I brought running shoes with me so that I could do exercise-- [Ja] Um, running or walking, [Ja] And I put one shoe in the suitcase, and the second shoe wouldn't and I stuffed the shoe in my backpack. [Ja] So when I'm going through kind of turned in the backpack. [Ja] So, everything's in [Jo] Yeah, it looks like an [Ja] Yeah, exactly. Like, [Ja] So then I'm like... Got a mostly-empty suitcase, save for some socks. You know, fallen soldiers. Some socks and some other things, where I was just like, &quot;Whatever. Um, and I was like, &quot;So, can I get rid of this suitcase?&quot; She was like, &quot;Yeah, if you and just leave it open, it'll be fine.&quot; So I was like, &quot;OK.&quot; 'cause then it's a security hazard and they'll go on the Seems very bomby. [Ja] So, I opened the suitcase, and it's all [empty] except for There still could be, like, something very important to - that I just left there. And then I start sprinting to the gate. Um, it's one of those mazes. You know how they do with the lines - for security, where it snakes? And I got in one, and there's no exit way. So I got into one 'cause and they were like, &quot;Oh, snake back out of this And I didn't wanna 'cause I thought I might get in trouble. And people are just weird at I didn't wanna get So then I go back to running down the way to get to the TSA pre-check line, and I'm sweating like crazy. I already sweat a lot, but And then, as if it was a cartoon, I'm wearing my hat, While I'm running, it keeps flying off, and I'm catching it and kind of - juggling it in the air. Is there toilet paper on [Ja] And then I finally get and it's the longest TSA There's all these people in front of us. But then these these two women behind me were, um... They were on the same flight, And so with them... and with me, people were like, &quot;Oh, your flight's boarding?&quot; And we're like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; - So they all let the three of us skip. And so thank you to our compatriots. Sorry. That was my left hand. - And... I am left-handed. So I... So then we're going through, and I'm just hoping that nothing beeps. You know, 'cause I missed a flight once because and it was in my pants and I didn't know. And I kept tripping the thing, and I was like stun-locked, trying to-- - [Jo] Was that ours, at the...? - And, uh... And so, uh... - Easy to find you, though. So then, um... We get through security, and then we're just running And we finally-- Thankfully, the two and I was running to the point of, like... I needed to stop. I felt like I was panting. I was running too hard. &quot;What's gonna delay me more, [Ja] Yeah. And so then-- So I see one of them in front of me, It felt like I was in a fighting game. I'm like, &quot;As long as... this person is still locking the I can get in behind them - and they'll still let me in. Yeah. I was like, &quot;As long So I saw them, and I eventually get up, and they just go, &quot;Are you Jarvis?&quot; And they were like, &quot;We were calling you.&quot; - I was like, &quot;Oh, I didn't notice.&quot; [Ja] &quot;Anyway, - Your plane left.&quot; And so I finally get on the plane, and I'm just sweating bullets. And I have exercise-induced asthma. So I start coughing. - Ugh. uh, like an illness or anything. It's literally just like that's coming from my lungs. - But the rest of them don't know. And then I'm also sweating, check my bag, and - And then there's a woman-- They were like, &quot;Where'd the bag guy go?&quot; 'Cause there's no overhead bin space. We need the bag guy. And then thankfully he finally And, um... And then a woman This airline always loses bags on flights to this airport.&quot; - thinking about-- - (both laughing) why are you telling me this right now?&quot; [Jo] &quot;Hey, did you know this airline's [Ja] Yeah. &quot;This is the plane. This is the one with no door plug!&quot; - [Jo] &quot;50% crash rate!&quot; [Ja] Seinfeld, talking about Boeing. - [Ja] &quot;50% crash rate!&quot; [Ja] &quot;Where--?!&quot; - (both laughing) [Jo] &quot;What's the deal--?!&quot; &quot;They should make the So, yeah. I did get on the plane. I was sitting in my seat, drenched in sweat, and... That's so frustrating, &quot;We don't need to sweat anymore. I think I have a photo. [Ja] So, that's me at the gate before [Ja] Because I'm in line now. [Ja] That's when [Ja] So there were still people who so I still had probably but you don't take any chances. - [Jo] They were still stun-locked. You can see the sweat on this [Ja] Discretionary [Jo] It's available for - [A] Mmhmm. [Ja] This is the hat that - [Jo] Your hair is... [Jo] A non-fixable problem. That's fair. [Ja] Oh, yeah. This is the condensation on my glasses from my body heat. - [Jo] I thought you had... hanging on my thing, and then-- [Ja] You can't really see it here, - [Jo] Even the glasses are sweating. [Ja] And then the me sweating in my seat. (laughs) - [Jo] It's like a Greek tragedy. but I'm actually happy because there were no more which is where I was flying to. [Ja] There were flights to LAX, but I would've had to buy a What was that...? The brand name of the pet therapy thing we saw - when we got to Burbank last time? [Jo] In fact, have we talked to - [A] I think we did. what the function of this, uh... - [Ja] Wait, I got it. when we were leaving Burbank. - [Ja] Waggage Claim. [Jo] Do you wanna guess the function [Jac] Um... is it... - to pick up your pet-- [Ja] I'll give you the context that that said &quot;Waggage Claim pet therapy.&quot; - [Jac] &quot;Waggage Claim pet therapy&quot;? [Jo] It is not picking up your pet. [Jac] Is it for your pet's - [Ja] (laughs) Great guess. - [Jo] You'd think. It... [Jo] The further from [Jac] Do they provide - [Ja] Ooh! Yeah, you got it. [Ja] They have a area [Ja] If you have just... [Ja] If you have flight anxiety that is not severe enough that you don't go to and that you make it to your but then you're just scared then there's some pets that you can pet. [Jo] And then taking off is... I mean, again... good luck! [Ja] I thought it was gonna be and making sure they [Jo] We did just do that. [Jo] When we go to We got her in the little backpack. Actually, Jacob, I'm gonna send you [Jo] It opens up. but she doesn't like [Jo] And the way she's sat [Jo] She's using 20% of the bag. [Ja] She'll let you know that because this is the - [Jo] The yap chap, brother. We've done a really - she's yapless with the two of us now. And she's still learning-- She hadn't met a lot [Jo] She... is such a flirt. [Jo] She loves you. And she loves Keenan. [Ja] Well, 'cause if a guest and they don't pay her attention [Jo] 30% attention tax on income. She will, like, sort of walk around you and And it's like, &quot;Are you upset?&quot; But then you pet her and - &quot;Yeah, that's what I want.&quot; [Ja] &quot;Actually, I was crazy back there. I was really going through it. I had some stuff [Jo] &quot;I hadn't been in &quot;I hadn't scrunched myself Yeah. &quot;I hadn't But yeah, she's... She has been better on the yap-chapping. Um, but it is, yeah, a 30% federal attention tax required on every visit. [A] When I was in the Albuquerque airport, - there were just... Like you said about, [A] I like Albuquerque. [A] But they have this who volunteered with their dogs - letting you pet their dogs. [Ja] So, I got further that I am introverted. (laughs) [Ja] Because, uh... [Ja] During this event, and the goal was to socialize and also talk to YouTube and-- [Jo] Is this like a public event [Ja] Uh, it's called YouTube Summit. [Ja] It is a very private event, - [Ja] I went in 2019, and I haven't been - [Jo] What did you do? [Ja] Well, just 'cause a lot of the and I'm kind of a hard sell, I think, just 'cause I'm on [Ja] Like, compared to your - [Jo] OK. There was a person who - [Jo] That's right, yeah. - [Jo] It's happened again! and we will be telling the story on [Ja] Jarvis is approached by [Jo] We wish we could say it publicly. - [Ja] (Trumpily) We wish we could. - the safety of the gossip. [Ja] I don't wanna put them on public [Ja] So that is available. and it's not gonna come up in public. [Ja] We won't mention it or call back to But for $5, maybe I'll do it. If you sign up for $5, No, I'll say it on the Nightz. [Jo] He'll say anything. [Ja] But again, it's like... [Ja] Well, that's all [Jo] Let's just say their... - [Ja] OK. [Ja] Um, but the introvert did-- [Ja] I just truly... [Ja] The amount of times... I, uh, needed to retreat to a bathroom or my room in the hotel to get away from people... [Ja] There was a lunch [Ja] And I always thought I was - [Jo] Like a circular table? in terms of you're assigned a number, - [Jo] Oh, right. [Ja] I cannot stress enough [Ja] And no one did anything wrong. [Ja] My discomfort... and lack of energy resulted in me... uh, leaving the lunch... I basically said... I basically said, uh-- 'Cause there was also some employees and I was like, &quot;Hey, um...&quot; Also my partner manager so this is a little... This is a little But I was-- I realized I was at my limit. I was a little overstimulated. And I basically just said, &quot;Hey, [Ja] I probably pointed at my phone, [Ja] And I just went to - [Ja] For three hours. [Ja] And, uh... [Ja] And during that time, I got a text that was like, [Ja] And I couldn't even get out of my - [Jo] Oh, yeah. The motion in between is also exhausting. Like, from laying or sitting to going to. Like, knowing that is more people and stuff. That's it. It's like you never And I don't wanna be--the thing is, everyone is so nice, and and I've only seen here and there, &quot;Oh, how have which I wanna fully show up for, you know? I wanna fully be there. I'm super exhausted or anything like that. Or be off-putting in any way. And so I feel like I solve that by not leaving until I'm ready for that. And so in my mind, I was like, &quot;We've got the Western roller rink event at 6:30, and I don't think I'm emotionally prepping myself for that. So even though it's puppies, And it's so ridiculous, but I hope, you know-- I'm sure people get it, because they've probably where there's no amount of... - anything that could get me out of the... I just needed to recharge, 'cause I just knew I was gonna be doing And not only do you wanna but you also wanna serve the other - [Ja] Exactly. [Ja] And what I'll give when I contributed, I did, like-- No one's gonna go, &quot;Oh, No, I was there. I was active. I was making my presence known. Um, but then I also And I didn't even sneak away, like... Like, if the lunch had come out sooner, 'cause it was a restaurant Oh, you hadn't done the food yet. [Ja] No, so I skipped the meal. I think I just got room service and paid [Jo] For one shrimp in a [Ja] And we had some vouchers, um... for the hotel restaurant. [Ja] But it was a situation where we'd had lots of very fruitful I had run out of knobs to turn. Like... If I can give myself then it keeps me there. If I can start - helping Jacob with the hot dogs, then it gives me an... It allows me to extend my time, - I otherwise need to go in a corner. 'Cause I just don't do well with nothing. And so then it was like... It was almost like I was trying a two-hour lunch after having done, uh, a bunch of other roundtables And I realized like an that my legs were giving out. [Ja] And the food hadn't &quot;I don't even have the food.&quot; that's an activity that [Jo] And then a post-food chat And then I could even go, &quot;Oh, I'm - Like, run to the elevator. There's also a energy deficit... that just comes from not being at home. The travel--you've already traveled... New place. Hotel room. You're at like 40% strength anyway. [Ja] And I'll say, you know, It's a very privileged position But, you know... I'm just acknowledging where I'm at with [Jo] Yeah. I mean, the There's no life circumstances comfort level with-- I think the &quot;doing something&quot; part [Jo] In both our cases, it's self-consciousness [Jo] I know we'll go home &quot;Was I such a fucking idiot? [Jo] Either ultimately know if there's somebody you're close [Jo] But I really do feel bad... when I leave something and felt like I was to other person or other people. But then, also, the time at that thing is compromised if all I'm doing is investing in-- 'Cause I'm not networking at It's people we know. It's people whose It's just like I have to Well, you host the majority of the bigger [Ja] And that gives me a schema. I think it's like it gives me-- [Ja] There's a bag of tasks [Ja] If I'm hosting, I'm always - [Jo] You have KPIs. I'm always allowed to go, - [Ja] I put myself to work. [Ja] I just can check on everybody else. If I'm ever reaching I can be like, &quot;All right, I gotta And people get it. They go, So it's like it's a environment where it's OK to do whatever I need to do. And it's always OK. But there's just like a... There's no social expectation. It's also OK in the context of, um... social dynamics. So, I think that that's We're also fortunate to have-- I feel like we've cultivated, at an understanding of... that might be, you know, we each have our own little traits, The people we're close to know about that and even silently can But then, also, a lot of the people are either similar or - in our, uh... You know, I have a handful like Evan. I'll text &quot;Hey, you wanna get coffee right now?&quot; Because we're both and we'll figure it out and neither of us have anything going on. But it will only be like a two-hour - Right. And then on the I think... anything Magic: The Gathering-oriented. That's got like a couple days' buffer, because it's usually like a... &quot;We gather.&quot; It is a gathering. But then with you, - because the literacy is there. [Ja] If we're playing Magic, - 'cause that's the task at hand. So, uh, now it's Lunchly time. - [Jo] Ooh, I'm hungry. Grumble, grumble. is the brand-new... lunch product from MrBeast, KSI, [Ja] Many years ago, I somehow ended up mailing product list, PR list. And so they would send me stuff, and I had no problem with But there's been a lot of crazy and also a lack of response - to those allegations. And then there's also [Ja] You know, never was but I was on this PR list. [Ja] But I have no allegiances. A couple weeks ago, Instagram made this feature and I think they've changed it already, At the top of my conversations, my DMs, you could have sponsored - [Jo] Mmhmm. through one of those and said, And I was like, &quot;You know what? This would be kind of funny.&quot; 'Cause I'm just curious, Whenever a company like that &quot;You don't know what I do.&quot; (laughs) [Ja] I'm like, &quot;There's a risk here.&quot; [Jo] Yeah, we're not I sent them my PO Box, and that was all I sent. They were like, Not my address, but I sent my PO Box. So then they sent a big thing of Prime, and so, um, we were like, &quot;Oh, it would and then also I just watched about all of the lawsuits [Ja] And then I also about how Logan Paul has, uh-- is actively suing Coffeezilla, The most recent time that he's threatening Um, and I think... You know, personally, a lot of opportunities to redeem himself, and every single time rehabilitated into a new version, - a new level of ascendance... He zags back into kinda [Jo] Somehow making I got maybe the... the most threatening DM From a brand. From Lunchly. [Ja] And I don't know what Lunchly is, 'cause I just woke up, you know? [Ja] And I hadn't seen the press release. [Ja] So I get a DM from this brand. [Ja] This happens &quot;Lunchly? Is that like Freshly?&quot; [Jo] &quot;Is it Lunch.ly?&quot; [Ja] And it says, &quot;Jarvis -- MrBeast [hand-shake] Logan Paul [hand-shake] &quot;Brought to you by the creators - who leave no crumbs.&quot; - [Ja] 'Cause they eat. - [Ja] They ate, actually. With this. [Ja] &quot;Lunchly features Prime Hydration, Feastables, and [Ja] &quot;Our friends at Feastables - shared your address--&quot; - [Jo] &quot;For an exclusive taste!&quot; [Ja] That was why it [Jo] &quot;We shared your address for [Ja] I was like, &quot;Oh, [Jo] And don't even, you know... [A] Also, at first I was like, &quot;Did they tweet out your [A] And then I realized what Lunchly was. [Ja] Exactly. &quot;Our friends at for an exclusive taste. We can't wait to see your taste-tests.&quot; [Ja] And so I figured we'd [Jo] Maybe... - it won't be what they want. (laughs) - [Jo] Who's to say? [Ja] I am completely open-minded here. [Ja] I've seen the discourse, I'm independent. I am The Thinker. - [Jo] You're unvaccinated. - [Jo] Huh? So, I think that we can give this an honest review. Everyone's talking about it, &quot;What do Jarvis and Jordan think? What does Sad Boyz Podcast think about the new Lunchables competitor With no endorsement of them as a brand, I don't really like any of But I am curious. [Ja] The first thing we noticed is because they have a [Ja] Or like a half Prime bottle. [Jo] Putting this in my kid's backpack as they kinda wobble [Ja] Yeah, it's crazy, um, because of how much [Ja] 'Cause it's very, like, heavy on one side, and so On the side, it says, [Jo] I just have to say, - [Jo] It's like half the size of the box. and this is just like what you buy-- [Ja] Like, you could packed just like this as a Lunchable, and that's who they're [Jo] I unconsciously 'cause it's very explicitly just... That's why they called it [Jo] One of the letters So, yeah, we got the crackers out first. So, you get--(laughs) [Ja] This comes with seven loose crackers. [Jo] Emphasis on &quot;loose,&quot; by the way. This compartment is enormous. It's gonna be smacking left and right. Kids are not delicate with - [Jo] They're gonna come out as dust. [Ja] Instead of the &quot;cheese product.&quot; [Ja] Logan Paul talked Even that's the wrong si-- - [Jo] Like, the cheese is... [Ja] OK, I have so many but I'm just gonna start 'cause these crackers, they just... [Jo] It's a cracker, yeah. - [Jo] It's like a Ritz, right? What do they call it, - [A] Yeah, I think. [Jo] I don't know what to tell you. - other than it being... [Ja] So, also, I know [Ja] But I'm just thinking about, like, these two things dominating and then there's also a [Jo] It literally feels like &quot;What if we got this and then we just got a bunch of chocolate? [Ja] This giant-ass box containing a 230-calorie [Jo] And even this is mostly empty space. - [Ja] Yeah. this could be half the size. [Jo] What is this cavity for? [Jo] There's a big hole here. [A] It's like it was [Jo] It looks like it was [Ja] All this stuff, like, like, out of the ordinary. [Ja] Like, They are just... putting a product in a market... that already exists. [Ja] And the thing is as healthier than their competitor, at least in their materials But yeah, it says, Prime caffeine-free.&quot; They have to &quot;MrBeast Feastables, - Epic ingredients like... [Ja] I mean, [Ja] This is not... - [Ja] It's just marketing, right? [Ja] It's just very funny [Jo] I mean, it's just an extension &quot;You've had this, [A] &quot;It's epic.&quot; [Ja] Actually the most [Ja] I would call it [Jo] It's more swag than that, [Jo] The cheese is [Ja] As it should be. [Jo] I assume there's [Ja] Now for the cheese. [Ja] Yup, and that's real cheese. [Ja] I would assume, 'cause they said it. I do think it's funny that they &quot;cheese product&quot; thing, and then it says, &quot;Contains a bio-engineered [Ja] Which is fine. Like, [Jo] I'll tell you what, this is like 230 calories. - [Ja] (laughs) Eating the cardboard. - (laughs) it'll weigh less. I'll carry [Jo] This is literally just a [Ja] The big one I'm excited about I think Lunchables pizza is good. And the other one is nacho chips... with queso blanco and salsa. [Ja] So, now we've got [Ja] I've been drinking my coffee [Ja] You know... it's a diuretic, so I'm losing water, losing moisture. [Jo] Will Logan Paul help me? [Ja] So this is the famous [Ja] This one looks [Jo] It's the most... little kid-coded one. [Ja] So, Prime, which must mean that they're using [Ja] Sucralose? Is that one? [A] Jordan, do you wanna [Jo] That'd be incredible. [Jo] Ugh. Strawberry banana? - [Jo] The fuck? [Ja] I guess the electrolytes of choice... [Ja] Yeah, potassium. They've got... 400 milligrams of potassium in here. - [Ja] Um... - [Ja] OK. - [Ja] All right. [Ja] All right, here's [Ja] It tastes like I'm drinking... a refrigerated melted-down ice pop. [Jo] It's the only one - [Jo] I hated every sip that I had. and I think that's the sucralose, and it salty kind of flavor of a electrolyte drink [Ja] But... put a pin in that, 'cause [Ja] You wanna try? - [Jo] I'm good. - was melted ice pop. but if I'm a kid, maybe that's more... [Ja] It's not the [A] Wash it down with [Jo] It's just cloying. Is that the word? [Jo] Or drinking really dark coffee, and it just... (clicks tongue) - Like, web in your mouth. [Jo] Let me wash it away [Ja] I will also say they sent me this... this, like, aluminum reusable bottle that looks like a full-size Prime bottle, and this is actually sick. (laughs) [Ja] I will say this is nice. [Jo] I do like getting bottles. [Ja] I love a container. [Ja] But funnily enough, I have that I like to use that is and we would name you so much if you sponsored us. [Ja] But, um, [Ja] And I like this because to put water in and then put [Ja] Let me get one more (laughs) It's not-- It's just, like... You know, there's a where you're not ready for it, - and it's just a little sickly-sweet. Um, anyway, Jacob's pulled up something - here on the monitor. [Ja] &quot;Prime energy sports drink contains PFAS and excessive caffeine, - class action lawsuits say.&quot; OK, so it appears there's a I don't know if these have resolved. [Ja] But I guess it's an allegation of [Ja] None of these are [Jo] It's unrelated, obviously, [Jo] It's just that this is the - purchasing with Lunchly, of course. and the one with caffeine is, uh... - is Prime Energy, which... [Ja] We can also try ice pop-- - ice pop flavor of that. [Jo] As we say, [Jo] No resolution or acknowledgment [Jo] Oh, this is ugly. Uh... - [A] That's the spooky one. [Ja] 'Tis the season. That's glowberry. [Ja] But let me... Hold on. [Ja] Mm. [Ja] This is way more palatable, 'cause energy drinks (both laughing) [Jo] So, for that, Logan, congrats. [Ja] So, actually, you're killing it. [Jo] Can I...? [Ja] You know what I mean, though? [Ja] You drink an energy drink, there's some stuff in that!&quot; [Jo] It feels like doing a shot. [Ja] Yeah, exactly. Like, I don't enjoy-- [Ja] Yeah, I don't enjoy tequila. [Jo] But I'm working towards something. [Ja] I do understand there could because this one says &quot;energy drink&quot; right [Jo] Almost imperceptible - Impact font 10,000 for the logo? [Jo] More or less. But it's not - hide the difference. [A] And it reminds me of - [A] I can't put my finger on it. [A] But it tastes like... - [Ja] Jesu--oh, never mind. I'm sorry. - [A] He had ghosts, I guess. - [Ja] Wait, can you--? - [Ja] I mean, this is... [Ja] I guess this is the amount of but 200 milligrams of caffeine, - [Jo] Jesus. [Jo] I mean, what's to a child's eyes, almost [Ja] Oh. [Ja] &quot;Prime's advertised is equivalent to half a dozen Coke cans or nearly two 12-ounce Red Bulls&quot;? - [Jo] God! [Jo] As we said, this is just - [Jo] Unrelated, obviously, to the... 'cause we were just [Jo] The product that [Jo] The suit continues to say of caffeine for children. could include rapid or irregular shaking, upset stomach, [Ja] Yeah, I didn't drink caffeine concerning thing for me as a... as an individual... is that we talked about the, um, - charged lemonade from Panera Bread. Or Panera. They don't call it - [Jo] They don't have any more bread. And the thing that is confusing-- their--what was it called? - I said it before. Charged. The charged lemonade was just in a cup, and it had more caffeine than even Prime. And you could refill it. is that this is the exact - but with twice the caffeine. [Jo] And also, you can... [Jo] Sure, I guess you that kids should know, and the kid can't buy it [Jo] This isn't marketing [Jo] Yeah, I guess that's right, the Paw Patrol on a beer. You know? [Jo] It kinda feels like it's, you know... Yeah. I mean, it's just like when... the people advertising it's I have yet to meet a, you know-- I guess now with WWE there are [Jo] Just to clarify... [Jo] Because one of them is a can... - [Jo] No one could make a mistake. [Jac] One of them and one of them is two Red Bulls. (Jordan laughs) - [Jo] Yeah, one of them kills. [Ja] OK, anyway, um, [Jo] Just an unrelated thing. [Jo] That's probably the last [Ja] Yeah, and anybody can file a lawsuit. - [Jo] For any reason. Maybe spite. [Ja] So, this is the pizza. [Ja] OK, first note is these little... [Ja] These feel smaller, but that has happened to [Jo] 'Cause of Biden? - [Ja] Yeah! [Ja] Um... oh, and this one comes with... - [Jo] Oh. [Ja] Let me get a quick [Ja] They smell identical. [ja] This one smells you dunked the ice pop in lemon. [Jo] Ugh. [Ja] OK--ohhh, that's the same. [Ja] (laughs) That is exactly the same. [Jo] Sorry, I just--have you - [Ja] No. - [A] So, that's not a energy one. which means hydration. - [Ja] I just sniffed my microphone. [Ja] I think I've had - [Jo] Something somewhere. [Jo] Full of plastic. - [A] It reminds me of something. - [A] Oh, Gushers. That's it. [Ja] Wow, it smells like Gushers. [Jo] I think it smells Logan A-Paul-ing. - [Ja] OK. You gotta go. [Ja] No, no. I will say which is a candy that I love, and I always want my - a candy that I love. [Ja] Yeah, Gushers. Smell it again. [A] That's totally what it is. [Jo] I'll throw out, though, of - [Jo] Does this one have caffeine, even? - [A] Bottle doesn't have caffeine. - [Jo] Me, an adult, didn't really-- [Ja] You keep getting confused - [Jo] I was born in 19(mumbles). - [A] And so they'd be fine. [Jo] OK, yeah, you're right. Sorry. The... - [A] Bottle = hydration. [A] Can equals power. [Ja] Powaaaa! [Jo] This one, again, [Jo] And kids know about [Jo] Like, whether or not it's good. &quot;Red Bull, definitely I shouldn't.&quot; - [A] I just wanna also add that the, um, youths that I know...(laughs) - [Jo] You have that friend that's a baby. [A] Um, they all brag about - [Ja] Right. That was definitely a thing. [Ja] OK, so we've got the... We've got the pizza. Um, this is our starter, like pizza dough. [Jo] Oh. OK. There goes I'm gonna eat this raw, because... You don't cook it, first of all. But I'm gonna eat this straight, I have a good taste memory 'cause maybe I've had [Jo] It's the same. [Ja] It's pretty close, [Ja] Um... [Ja] So that's good if you're [Ja] And two similar products Coke and Pepsi, you know? - [A] Wait. Wait, hold on. [A] Is the Lunchly font almost exactly the same [Ja] Oh. [J&amp;J] Whooooooa. [Ja] I mean, yeah, [A] They're slightly different, [Jo] Well, the Lunchly font [Jo] Oh, yeah, the letters, like, kerned [Ja] Yeah, it's like the same. - [Ja] But, I mean, whatever. [Ja] OK, this pepperoni, it passes the Lunchable [Ja] I do wanna point something out. [Ja] This doesn't matter; It's just funny. this would probably be the case. [Ja] The cheese is - when I sleep without a bonnet on. - [Ja] Which is very funny. - [Ja] Yeah, all--yeah. - but you can feel it. [Ja] Like, before the show and ran a little water through my hair. [Ja] And it just [Jo] Should we pour some [A] Are you gonna construct a pizza? [Ja] I'll let Jordan construct the pizza. [Jo] I'm creative. [Ja] This pouch and the pizza sauce, I have another good taste memory. [Ja] But the issue with this [Ja] The Lunchables [Ja] And it shows you where to tear. [Ja] Oh, I think maybe here? [A] OK, we'll do a little test to see if a child at, um... lunchtime could easily open it. [Jo] The famous dexterity of a little kid. [Ja] Oh, no. I'm scared. Wait. - [Ja] Am I an idiot? - [Ja] I'm just not sure. [Ja] Shouldn't there be a [A] There should be a little cut. - [Ja] Can we all inspect this? [Jo] I feel like it's gonna explode. [Ja] Oh, Jordan bit it. He got it open. [Jo] This literally does [A] BB tried the turkey &quot;If you gave me a Lunchable I couldn't tell the difference.&quot; [A] The, um... [A] &quot;Not sure if the cheese is - sure are the same.&quot; [A] &quot;But Feastable bar [Ja] Ooh, yeah. I will that's a product that's I think the first run of They changed the recipe; it's better. [Ja] OK, so what's the [Ja] Oh, interesting. [Jo] I had to wash my hands [Ja] Oh, yeah, no. I was just gonna which, I guess, 'tis the season. [Jo] Ooh, spooky! No. [Ja] Oh, Jacob--yeah, no, this is... [Ja] I think Jacob just &quot;Logan Paul's Prime sports drink [Jo] Oh, that's this one. [Ja] &quot;Refresco alleges Congo Brands, which sells the hydration beverage, backed out of its [Ja] Wow, that's from August. [Jo] They did that on purpose, [Jo] I pray it's not true. There would [Jo] &quot;Refresco claims part involved establishing a production line for plastic bottles in Trusedale, Missouri for three years.&quot; [Ja] Right, and then Prime says that they &quot;repudiated the agreement, and from the facility.&quot; But my understanding is that when you sign you can't just leave the [Ja] But I'm not a lawyer, [Ja] You know, I don't know what... [Ja] I will say, for me, it feels like they must have tested, like, the... [Ja] They must have until they got it almost exact, 'cause the degree is really impressive. Oh, this one's rough. The strawberry banana... [Jo] I mean, I'm not a big That's just one that doesn't work for me. - [Jo] Like cilantro. [A] Honestly, if I were a kid, [A] Like, I had such that I think I would've loved all of this. [Ja] And the thing is - [A] Stop drinking it, Jordan! - [A] Oh, OK. like, as a society, - artificial sweeteners. [A] I don't like the cherry one at all. - [A] That was bad. [Ja] The research &quot;don't take the risk,&quot; [Ja] So I don't know if I would that was predominantly [A] And from what I've heard, also-- [A] I don't know if this is true. [Ja] Oh, that sucks. - [Jo] (laughs) Which one is that? - [Jo] It's rough. gobstoppers? You know, like the banana in That has always been the artificial banana. And I'm tasting it here, but I don't wanna taste it in a... - [A] It's like a chemical-- [Jo] There's a chalky [A] That's why I think [Ja] You know what? [Ja] 'Cause I'm not [Ja] Runts! That's what it was, [Jo] Oh, I recognize the little banana. [Jo] I know that little banana. [Ja] All right, I guess last [Ja] What was this called? - [A] Nacho... - [A] Fiesta nachos. - [Jac] This was always my favorite. - even as a Lunchable. the tiny round tortilla chips. [Jac] I would always grab like - [Ja] OK, yeah, that's good. - but taste that &quot;salsa.&quot; - [A] Oh, yeah. [A] The salsa tastes like, um, ketchup or tomato paste. [Ja] The salsa feels like it has, um... It feels like someone took tomato paste - and put taco seasoning in it? It has the aftertaste. - [A] Here, I'll hand it back. [Jo] Maybe get your own show. [Jac] Oh, there's no texture to it. [Jo] It's really weird, right? - I keep grabbing this drink, and then I go, &quot;Ooh, It's like a... I feel like I get [Jo] Random thought, I'm sure some people would [Jo] They'd say, &quot;This is shaped like an [Jo] With the charged that didn't understand and that slip-up happened or whatever. [Jo] You could say, &quot;Well, [Jo] To my understanding, the kid [Jo] Probably an adult and probably got a request to buy Prime. They see it in a Lunchly. - I'll get the canned one.&quot; [Ja] Also, kids can think for themselves. - They're gonna ask for these things, 'cause their favorite guys said it. [Jo] But it's not marketed so there's no reason exact same coloring and [Jo] They'd probably think it was a... [Jo] They wouldn't think [Ja] Jacob, what's the review? [Jac] Um, it's unfortunately flavorless. - (Jarvis laughs) [Jac] The interesting thing, they brag about how their salsa isn't as runny as Lunchables'. [Jac] But I'm like, I don't know [Ja] &quot;Runny&quot; is like a [Ja] (laughs) You know? [A] And this tastes like tomato pastes. [Jo] I mean, tomato puree. [A] Yeah. [Jo] Roasted bell pepper--is that any...? [Jo] Again, if I was more cynical, is essentially a ghillie suit, camouflage, for getting kids even more - [Jo] But I'm not cynical. [Ja] Wait. What is the [Ja] Is that 360? [Ja] Yeah, it's exactly [Ja] Everything's calculated, It's a Chris Kyle-esque, you know, - sharp shot. [Ja] I mean, there's not much [Ja] It costs... roughly as much as its competitor, as long as we're including [Ja] And then it tastes like-- [Ja] Again, if you close your eyes, even the pizza, which is such a unique... [Ja] Like, most adults who didn't have the memory for it. [Ja] That was like the creme [Ja] I would beg for that. And, um... [Ja] And it tastes [Ja] Uh... so, yeah. I mean, [Ja] Is in the marketing. Um... [Jo] Maybe the insidiousness. [Ja] Again, I have no horse in this race. [Ja] The Feastable bars - [Jac] The crunch ones are. [A] Yeah, we've tried 'cause they obviously had Jarvis's [A] But yeah, they were good. I can't have a strong opinion I think the product itself and near carbon copy of Lunchables. - Um... [Ja] And Lunchables are not [Jo] I think the mission, be a competitor in a and they'll make In the same vein that MrBeast's videos primarily function these days as a conduit to promote and grow the brand-- that's where the actual revenue to further cement primary audience of children. [Jo] If Feastables, of course, had a version of this [Jo] This is just a theory. [Jo] That was maybe or potentially has [Ja] We gotta look into this. [Jo] You know, or maybe caffeine inside the [Jo] Then I would probably [Ja] Yeah. I mean, it's just... Does the MrBeast milk crunch bar compare to a Crunch bar? A lot of these things are made at similar factories. Like, if you get-- If you get one from it feels the same way. Obviously, [Ja] I think they worked on it. [Ja] It's very clearly a It's very much like, &quot;There we have a big influence in the market that Lunchables is--&quot; [Ja] It feels very calculated. [Ja] And why wouldn't it be? [Ja] I think these are people who've off of being very calculated strategic, at the expense of other values that one may hold. There's also another lawsuit about-- There's another manufacturer lawsuit. <i>Now yet a third company claims <i>Agrovana is a <i>which says it has <i>surprisingly close to $67 million, [Ja] We just found this We just got swept in. I mean, that guy has really good videos. We're gonna link to LegalEagle's video. Exceptionally reliable. Very and I'd say a pretty trustworthy source. He has a video called &quot;Everyone is - [Ja] That's crazy. but it's probably for no reason at all. [Ja] Yeah, it seems like they're jealous. [Ja] Anyway, we'll link that. [Jo] Yeah, the food is pretty good. [Jo] Uh, the drinks truly - (Jarvis laughs) Not for me. allow Logan Paul, you know, a gradual and sinister way, of how health and access [Jo] You know, it's a pretty [Ja] Yeah, that's Jordan's opinion. [Ja] I kinda think that these Prime drinks are so sweet - [Ja] You could make a mean cocktail. [Ja] &quot;Mean&quot; in that it would [Jo] Yeah, and you'll [Ja] It'd be a very strong flavor. - [Ja] OK. Well... at least he's not, you know... [Ja] At least he's not - [Jo] 'Cause that would be pathetic. especially not someone [Jo] Another extremely reputable source. [Ja] Yeah, who's just, you know, who's talked about these things and kinda has a lot of and Logan Paul himself has only to later... threaten a lawsuit, renege it, and then... And then apologize - And then sue him again. 'Cause it's... which almost, I would say warrants some both professionally and personally. As does kind of the of him doing pretty egregious - But I like his flips. - [Ja] He is really good at flips. Mmhmm. Your words, not mine. - [Jo] Bad bloke, shit product. about the Logan Paul He's fundraising, because he that Logan Paul does to carry this... carry this lawsuit to trial. Defend himself a frivolous lawsuit. Yeah, shoutout to Coffeezilla I always get sucked into his content. Um, for just putting some stuff together. I'm just trying to eat my... I'm just trying to eat &quot;the pizza.&quot; I'm trying to have a little snack, these articles about the actions of that I would have questions with. Yeah, I just wanna [Jo] I'm just trying to eat my wet salsa. [An] And leave no crumbs. [Ja] I wanna leave no crumbs! I personally think - and Lunchable... - Lunchable is goofy-ahh. You know? Goofy-ahh-ya. Um, OK, wait. So... Everyone's responded to [Ja] Oh, DanTDM. OG YouTuber. [Ja] DanTDM. [Jac] Who basically - about the whole Lunchly thing. [Jac] And he said, I can't not say anything anymore.&quot; [Jac] And basically marketing a product towards towards this kind of marketing, and it's really clearly geared towards [Jo] Well, OK, I guess. If you say so. [Ja] Yeah. And then Logan... Well, Logan Paul's known for his Like that thread about when - Yeah, and he was annoyed by that. [Jo] And that time he posted serial killer-style note about [Ja] &quot;I'll tell you what happened creating content and building our brands.&quot; [Ja] &quot;Now we wanna build--&quot; (both singing &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot;) [Ja] &quot;Now we wanna build when Lunchables faces bans - for allegedly containing LEAD!&quot; [Ja] &quot;But when we create [BOTH] &quot;Then don't eat it.&quot; [Jo] I don't think you're [An] Should he be bringing up lead? - [Ja] Uh, the... oh, no! [Ja] &quot;The ice pop Prime Hydration also has reports of lead contamination.&quot; - [Ja] Nooo! Not our ice pop Prime! - [Ja] (laughing) We just drank that! [Ja] Noooo-uh! [Jo] You're saying even if it's not it might still... pose maybe not OK, wow. That's just... I do think that you know when it says &quot;Accounts @LoganPaul [Jo] That's worse than just nothing. [Jo] Just let people clown on you. [Ja] Can you go to his feed? [Ja] He said something to Elon Musk, like, &quot;Hey, everybody's--&quot; Oh, wait. [Ja] &quot;Always a pleasure to expose [Ja] &quot;By the way, they removed Or no, it got marked as 'needing And although it's gone, it's not removed.&quot; [Ja] And then he @ed to a richer man. - [Jo] It's not gone, though, right? [Jo] OK. Guess it got the votes. [Ja] &quot;As of the publishing of on the aforementioned - [Jo] Rats. [Jo] Are there open replies [Ja] Oh, and then they say--so, Logan Paul [Ja] And then that got &quot;This isn't a 'lie' from community notes. ice pop Prime has 500 milligrams of potassium on its nutrition label. The 500-milliliter bottles are 700 milligrams of potassium.&quot; - [Ja] And yeah, that's... [Jo] It helps him out, 'cause why would [Ja] Right. Interesting. So, MrBeast responded. Oh, so he does He responded to the criticism that affects - the product that he's selling. [Ja] &quot;Lunchables sells and countless people eat it.&quot; [Ja] Which is true, why they wanna get in the market. [Ja] &quot;Our goal is to give people OK. &quot;Our turkey meal, for [Ja] OK, but... 80 less calorie-- Less calories doesn't mean good. You need calories! [Jo] Especially as a kid, You can have it. That may as well say [An] Well, that's like if you eat a that's gonna be more calories [An] So that's what they're doing. Half of a peanut butter and jelly [Jo] Yeah. That's better, in fact, little bits of peanut that counts as a good meal. [Ja] So, &quot;Obviously, eating fresh but if someone eats a premade meal, then giving them a higher-quality version - [Jo] That's why they launched it. [Ja] I think the issue is with the marketing of it, because... it's very clearly a--I think it's... [Ja] You can't hide behind the noble... like, a noble cause. [Jo] And people see-- I saw a reference the other day, every single generation basically since... uh, corporate advertising and became codified in the... around the '50s, basically. cultural jingoism is where you you know, Mad Men era comes around, &quot;Why would you smoke a cigarette? The cigarette is bussin', actually.&quot; And like every single - finds PR-speak less palatable. Every single generation. And it is so bizarre to me... Back in the Patreon days, half of my job was literally just internally and associated with us, like, &quot;Don't talk like this to people. It's intuitively off-putting, and you're But everyone has to talk and phrase and paragraph-break responses like this like it's some kind of &quot;You can't take the Lord's name in vain. You can't write a response with less than 500 words.&quot; It is so transparently unsettling. There is no one you need to convince that you're doing this altruistically. - It doesn't benefit you. for having merch. it's not like YouTubers like we sell merchandise, right? [Ja] We have a [Ja] And DanTDM, he has a Youtooz. [Ja] I had a Youtooz, you know? [Ja] I don't think it's, like... [Ja] I think what the issue is 'cause no one's saying--like, people... [Ja] You know, Ludwig, like... started working on financing [Ja] And tons of YouTubers have created other businesses that are fine. [Ja] Like, Zach from the And no matter how motivated it is by genuine interest or wanting to invest in workers... it is embarrassing to try &quot;I'm doing it... Like, oh. Really? Do more of the If that's your only interest, I think [Ja] I mean, I guess I just can't-- You know, again, don't have the issue with making money or - [Jo] I have issue with the insincerity. Uh, it just feels like What did Doctor Mike say? <i>I wanted to go further and <i>using the nutrition facts from the <i>and it's honestly really hard to <i>for several reasons.</i> <i>One: I don't have nutrition <i>For example, how many <i>vs. the food component?</i> <i>Second, some of the <i>The turkey cracker kit from <i>while Lunchly's is 72 grams.</i> <i>Three: There are so many <i>that just swapping out <i>caused significant differences [Ja] At least these things are [Ja] I think that's something [Ja] Sorry; Doctor Mike [Jo] Oh, no.

[Ja] Um, Mr. Mike, it says &quot;must be implemented They're working on it, [Jo] They're gonna [Ja] They're gonna take more food out!

[Jo] The existence of low-cal [Ja] Like, we as a society have... [Ja] We've really failed, - [Ja] We've messed everything up. I do think is, like... a class bubble thing, in the same way that a &quot;Well, if you don't want why don't you cook every night?&quot; - 10 hours a day, minimum. [An] Plus it can be more expensive - a burger somewhere. [Jo] And in the exact &quot;Oh, why don't they... [Jo] I have not read this study. [Jo] I don't even have any children. [Jo] And I am somewhat - [Ja] Yeah. I literally didn't know what protein-- - as in, like, what protein is in, - until I was 21. 'Cause I moved to the US, where people are a little I never heard a reference. Especially in a meal, you would never say, &quot;Oh, this sausage is a protein.&quot; - Protein's like a chemical in the brain. And I just... It is, I think... a little bit of, like, It's like everyone knows the [Ja] We've really fumbled this a lot of and we're commentating - [Jo] We're just a couple doctors. lean on the opinions of, if not experts, people who are far more who are also citing things. <i>Kids need energy to function, <i>Lunchly turkey contains <i>which would mean a kid <i>to consume enough calories.</i> [Jo] That kid would collapse, carrying [Ja] I think he also does a <i>And if they did that, they'd get <i>which is also significantly <i>So they'd be either under-eating [Jo] Can I get one of [Ja] I don't know if, yet, you can. [Ja] But what I heard is that and that means it has as the fuckin' losers at Lunchables. [An] Yeah, we always know that... [An] We know electrolytes, [Ja] Yeah, you just need [Ja] 'Cause you are, uh, Static Shock, and [Jo] Dude, I'm sick to death [Jo] Creatine in his smoothie - [Ja] Bulk up! [Jo] It's cutting season, so no carbs. - [Jo] He's very tired. - telling your kid it's cutting season? [Jo] And he's just a [An] Have you seen those [Ja] I've seen them, and - [An] OK. One more thing that I wanted to look at is that I watch to learn but he did a video about this [Ja] Can you look up Brian Sutterer? <i>I made this little joke about sodium <i>because that's really <i>We've taken things <i>that historically <i>in a very respectable fashion.</i> - [Jo] Let's say I'm a billionaire. [Jo] I'm a multi-millionaire, [Ja] OK. - [Jo] I'm probably busy on my yacht. [Jo] What I do not do... [Jo] Sure, I'll do my [Jo] Probably not even me. [Jo] What I am is emotionally secure, as a result of going through a making several apologies, certainly not doing frivolous lawsuits - extremely valid criticisms of me. [Jo] But the last thing I would do is get caught up in a beef. (laughs) - [Ja] That's true. with, like, the same energy as someone removing you from <i>Logan seemed to take <i>calling me a <i>saying I can't tell the difference <i>Logan, I assure you I can.</i> <i>I understand the <i>and we're gonna talk [Ja] Can you believe... that Logan Paul has the gall? [Ja] He even read that this guy - and then put it in quotes. - [An] And then said &quot;you idiot.&quot; but if the guy's name on Twitter says - [Ja] Like, &quot;Oh, he might be a doctor.&quot; [Ja] This is the whole thing where It's all fake news. Do your own research.&quot; [Ja] And it's like, no! Doing reading a conspiracy theory - on a fake website. [An] Also, I just love that someone, um, who is a doctor - [Jo] &quot;A doctor.&quot; [An] It's funny, but it's also very smart. [An] It's like, yeah, this is crazy - how sodium got rebranded. [An] And then Logan Paul responds in, like, the most childish way possible. [An] &quot;Uh, you don't know - [Ja] &quot;You idiot.&quot; [Jo] It's also very cringe [Ja] It's like if you poured-- If you poured, like, a entire canister of you could still put on the <i>And then MrBeast, this was <i>and this is really the <i>&quot;More electrolytes.&quot; Lunchables, <i>Their product, &quot;80 less calories,</i> <i>60% less sugar, more electrolytes.&quot;</i> <i>Generally speaking, <i>of managing the proper <i>We shouldn't have to rely <i>of electrolytes beyond our food</i> <i>for just normal [Ja] I'm getting sucked into this, - [Jo] It's a good video.

[Ja] Then you were like, &quot;Hmm, what if we just drained - [Ja] &quot;That could help?&quot; [Ja] Oh, OK. No, don't high-five. [Ja] Did I... did I help it? - [Ja] Is it better now? - [Ja] It heals naturally. I did it! - [Ja] No, but it'll be healed soon. - [Ja] Just drink this drink. Obviously, we're gonna link the video. But the gist of one of the which is something that I have heard I've maybe even mentioned it. replace what is and primarily, the thing that you lose when you're sweating And that's why, uh... up to this point, most of use sodium as the electrolyte because it's... [Ja] It's the dominant [Ja] Prime... [Ja] And this is, like, more of a theory and [Ja] It appears that it is possible... [Ja] Just covering my bases here. [Ja] It appears that it's putting a ton of potassium in these drinks so that they can say that they have more while only having 10% of, uh... [Ja] While only having [Ja] This one has 30 milligrams of sodium. [Ja] But, um... [Ja] But it has 700 [Jo] It's kinda the same just taking stuff out, where you're [An] Yeah, or like fat-free. [An] But you're putting - [Ja] Yeah. [Jo] &quot;This La Croix is fat-free.&quot; Like, OK, I guess. All right, well, again, we're not experts. Um, we're just sharing some - [Jo] Just a couple of lawyers. And we also did-- What we are an expert in is what we like. And we tasted Lunchly and it tastes exactly so congrats on that, I think. And we tasted Prime, and, um... - [Jo] Uh-oh. (J&amp;J both blow raspberries) Oh, yeah, before we wrap up-- [Jo] You may notice something [Ja] So, we... [Ja] Over on our Patreon, we have been doing these mail bags that we're doing monthly, but we don't know the cadence yet. [Ja] We don't know that they're [Jo] They are free. [Ja] Oh, yeah, there's a couple [Ja] Like, for example, today of our Magic Moment, little free episode so that we can spare the [Ja] But we wanna talk [Ja] And if you've been following Magic, you know the big drama You can also find a free video-- Again, you can even access but you can make an account, follow and then if you would like you can also using your discretionary which gives you access to-- Are we over 100? No. Not yet. How many [An] Nightz? [Ja] 80. Wow. We're getting up there. - Creeping towards 100. 20% less, actually... (laughs) than 100. [Ja] No, but we have 80 episodes of our Patreon-exclusive podcast. [Ja] You get access to all of those [Ja] There's other content for but again, none of that is required. [Ja] We just wanted to shout out, uh, - this blanket... that someone made by hand. - [Jo] Really nice quality. the amount of stitching and the amount of colors. - [An] I wanna say her name is Katie. [Ja] Uh, Kate, thank you so much. [Ja] Also, can we maybe share this, uh... cotton yarn? This big [Ja] Oh my God, I didn't realize [Ja] This is incredible. - [Ja] Truly incredible. - [Jo] Oh, that looks cool. [Ja] I mean, we just feel very lucky [Ja] And wanted to thank [Ja] And, you know, [Ja] And also, no promises that so just know that, like, this is just a little community thing [Jo] We got through a small [Ja] Yeah, so we're working through that. [Ja] But we are gonna head and I'm gonna talk about yet another creator that Uh, and the conversation that ensued, and then some other stuff as well. [Jo] I'm gonna be doing a bunch of karate. [Jo] I've been practicing a backflip. [Ja] Yeah, you're a doctor, [Jo] And a cowpoke. [Ja] A cowpoke, a cowboy. - [Jo] I might be a redneck. Oh, yeah. Should we close out with - [Ja] Oh, let's do it. [An] You might be a he has something in his teeth, and he... - [Ja] Takes it out. [Ja] He removes his dentures to look. [Ja] He removes his dentures to look. [Jo] He shoots it out with a six-shooter. [Jo] He blasts his own head off. - [An] He he takes them out to see. [Jo] That's kinda just [Ja] We end every episode of [Jo] Ooh, Anastasia, have you ever done - [A] OK. - [A] Yes. - [J&amp;J] We love you. - [Ja] Awww! Boom! [Ja] We're gonna keep it going [Ja] He came up to me at this &quot;Yeah, man, no worries about the video,&quot; or something similar But I try to have a rule of, like, I never say anything in a video that I wouldn't be comfortable [Ja] And I said to him, and he's like, &quot;I like to [Ja] And that's like, (outro music)
