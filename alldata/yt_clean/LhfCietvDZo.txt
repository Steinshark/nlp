In the spring of 1806, two German astronomers when they noticed something odd. The hemisphere facing away from the Sun Instead, it had a faint glow This Ashen Light resembled It's when sunlight, reflected by the Earth, It seemed reasonable, therefore, Namely, that sunlight reflected by a Venusian moon Only one slight problem, This meant the Ashen Light because there was nothing in In the words of famed &quot;those regions that are turned from the A few decades later, another German proposed a rather creative The Ashen Light was the result of sweeping deliberately ignited by its inhabitants. As absurd as that sounds, there were tantalizing The two planets were of similar size and, A densely cloud-laden atmosphere which gave free rein to speculate about A barren desert. A planet-wide ocean. A tropical rainforest. Anything was possible. It was in this context that Gruithuisen He believed that Venus was inhabited by a humanoid species The purpose of which was either to clear land, or to celebrate the coronation Gruithuisen did, perhaps, but he was far from the first Titans of astronomy like envisioned all the planets, including Venus, And it took a long time for this In 1916, this illustration appeared in American &quot;A Remarkable Drawing by Mr. Winsor McCay as Astronomical Science Even well into the space age, we still find In 1967, a Soviet spacecraft plunged into the clouds While the probe did not survive in case of a water landing. History is ripe with stories Largely forgotten stories that, once upon a time, Bygone visions of life asunder, Venusian fire festivals were not the cause of the Ashen Light, By the end of the 19th century, But some astronomers would without ever catching Instead, they would often be greeted They covered large portions of the planet and appeared At least, that was the opinion of American Far from the diffused shadings reported by his peers, &quot;It is as if a bright veil of some sort These spokes of Venus bore a striking resemblance ...and Mars. The features on Mars were especially Lowell had been somewhat unimpressed but he became nothing short of &quot;There are celestial sights more dazzling, but to the thoughtful observer there is nothing in the sky so profoundly Owing to their striking linearity, The Martian Canals must be He carefully laid out his arguments filled with these intricate The Martian Canals represented designed to carry melted ice water While many were the idea that Mars could be inhabited Perhaps, even Legendary science fiction author H. G. Wells A fictional story about a Martian invasion of Earth, But a decade later, Wells published a speculative Inspired by Lowell's fanciful interpretations, ...society... ...and appearance To Wells and many others, the existence of Indeed, to some, it had already In 1891, the French Academy of Sciences was bequeathed The money was to be awarded to the first person who found the means With the notable exception of Mars. Implying that communicating with Martians The reality of the Martian Canals was difficult to Telescopes were never quite good enough A book commissioned by NASA &quot;Although there is no unanimous opinion most astronomers would probably agree Indeed maps of the Red Planet published featured sprawling networks of canals. &quot;A towering Atlas Agena rocket is the launch vehicle &quot;Scientific apparatus on the Mariner will try to &quot;And a television camera will seek to &quot;Giving man his first close-up look at Mars.&quot; The American spacecraft Mariner IV transmitted the first close-up photographs Despite the complete absence of any linear markings, &quot;...nothing positive concerning can be concluded on the basis Hesitation and dwindling hopes aside, &quot;The canals, the cities, the Martians are all gone.&quot; &quot;Imaginative inventions.&quot; &quot;Optical illusions.&quot; As early as 1903, had an experiment seated a few meters away could discern fine straight lines The experiment demonstrated that could evoke a linear appearance. This sort of &quot;visual inference&quot; is even said I mean, look at this. Not only is there a clear correlation but you can almost see these barely The spokes on Venus, meanwhile, bear It appears that Lowell constrained the aperture that the blood vessels inside his eye Some of which might have creating the illusion of labyrinthine &quot;It is as if a bright veil of some sort Whether it was optical illusions, turbulence in the atmosphere, or an untempered willingness to believe, these There is something incredibly tragic I mean, there was a time, not so long ago, There is still hope of finding less complex forms of life but also a far cry from a tropical Venus As our knowledge of the universe continues to expand, By the mid 20th century, the Ashen Light had been Many of whom were as experienced as they were Despite this preponderance the lack of empirical evidence In fact, doubts have plagued Italian astronomer Giovanni Riccioli is often recognized In early 1643, Riccioli witnessed a band of colors The nightside was tinted greenish-blue, Riccioli ascribed the vivid colors to An effect known as chromatic aberration. In other words, Riccioli thought the Okay, so, a quick aside. I managed to find has gone completely unnoticed A German priest and scholar named Athanasius Kircher wrote No date was given, but Kircher Based on historical records, Kircher paid his last So Kircher observed the Ashen Light five years before Okay, back to the video. Riccioli's doubts about the Ashen Light it was not uncommon for sightings Not only were observations infrequent and Brightness, color, and the extent could vary drastically between accounts. With no hard proof of its existence and a lack of the Ashen Light appeared destined But, in 1975, the Soviet spacecraft Venera 9 Diving into the shadow of this faded twin, emanating from the clouds below. Venus and Mars have historically been the But the other planets have Scottish astronomer James Ferguson When it came to Mercury, for instance, simply possessed &quot;It is very likely that the people [on Mercury] [as] we have of the inhabitants of Jupiter and Saturn; and have very little light at so Inspired by Ferguson's optimism, In 1795, Herschel confidently announced that the This might seem incredibly bizarre, but, at the time, as an enormous planet Herschel expanded upon that idea by regarding that momentarily exposed This concealed surface was who were shielded against the immense heat &quot;...we have great reason to look upon the sun Apart from the planets and the Sun, another Using stunning contraptions of tubes, wires, and lenses, produced some of the earliest detailed Whereas you and I see a Hevelius espied upon the Moon Mountains and valleys, rivers and lakes, This vivid interpretation can be bright and dark patches In fact, this fallacy is still reflected in Dark plains on the Moon all have ...the Lake of Dreams... ...and the Sea of Tranquility. &quot;Tranquility Base here, the Eagle has landed.&quot; Though water never filled these gloomy basins, for they are the volcanic scars Making the Lake of Death While Hevelius never observed its subjective resemblance to the Earth A conviction still being upheld more than a &quot;I hope, and am convinced, very evident signs of life It didn't take long for these very evident &quot;...I am almost convinced that those numberless are the works of the Lunarians Herschel nearly convinced himself had been engineered by its inhabitants. Craters, or &quot;circuses&quot;, were not the remnants but skilfully constructed While Herschel obsessed over circular dwellings, espied habitats &quot;[This] star-like structure [...] appears and, because of its star-shape, &quot;The circle in the south, the two highest and the two hills in the south-west &quot;[But] it is highly probable serve as the dwellings In reality, Gruithuisen mistook some The increasingly speculative nature culminated in a truly in-credible sighting &quot;...whilst gazing upon we were thrilled with astonishment to perceive &quot;They were like human beings...&quot; &quot;...their wings possessed great expansion, The Moon was evidently home to This was a truly profound, if not bemusing, discovery. Because, upon being inquired about his He had had no knowledge It turns out the story had been fabricated Locke had sought to lampoon the often frivolous perpetuated by the likes of Instead, the Great Moon Hoax of 1835 that the Moon was inhabited by bat-like humanoids, as well as, well, There's also this image of a man-bat besat helivaced by a pack of man-bats. As to why this guy is copping a whiff, As time went on it became increasingly difficult With no apparent atmosphere, this dry and barren But, by the mid 19th century, by a new hypothesis The argument was that gravitational forces This uneven distribution of mass would have coalesced on whichever side If that happened to be the farside of the Moon, As one author put it: &quot;...though the near hemisphere is a lifeless desert, the hidden hemisphere Among the proponents of this radical hypothesis &quot;[An egg-shape] would fully account for the on the side of the moon and would be quite compatible and of a habitable hemisphere, Had history perhaps we'd be dealing with egg-mooners No, but that's lunacy. Okay. While skeptics made quick work of farside inhabitants After all, the farside of the Moon is unseeable &quot;So, then I subjected them to a spectrographic analysis. &quot;Larry, what you're saying is that, the Moon has been encircled &quot;Something's going on on the other side &quot;Something that we oughta know about.&quot; By placing aliens early science fiction authors were able to If aliens wanted to conceal their presence this cosmic blindspot At least, that was the opinion &quot;It is not out of the question that artifacts [...] or even &quot;Because of weathering it might have appeared preferable &quot;The Moon seems one reasonable Humanity got its first glimpse when the Soviet spacecraft Luna 3 Subsequent missions improved upon the quality But this idea of concealment Many are still holding out hope that, the ruins or technology of some In 1988, the Soviet Union launched As the name implies, part of its mission The probe arrived at Phobos without any major began preparations to plant But then, contact with Phobos II was lost. In the weeks and months that followed, Puzzling features and shadows were said to be visible The nature and origin of which Through various articles, these images were They appeared to depict It was said to be an alien spaceship that Not only that, but it cast an enormous But this shadow appeared quite suddenly and probably didn't Because then it So it's not an object hanging above the surface Probably, probably. Because, well, it doesn't completely cover, It looks like... ...a rocket taking off from the surface How do you feel about this? Well, if you let your imagination run wild, then, of course, But we tend to believe ...although still unexplained Most likely, it's still a shadow because surface elements The mystery persisted until the raw data from the The unidentified craft looked an awful lot In fact, all the infrared images Meanwhile, the elliptical shadow Its elongated shape was due to multiple before assembling Stories like the Phobos Incident Some initial event or discovery leaves an information vacuum A printing artifact becomes The happenstance of light and shadow And these prominent boulders on both Mars and Phobos More recently, a Chinese rover on the Moon Upon closer inspection, everyone was absolutely Whether you're an amateur or professional, you're never quite immune When you want something to be true, it can be Remember that prize money? who discovered a means of communicating Well, in 1937, The claimant was none other In 1899, Tesla had been experimenting During some of those experiments, &quot;Although I could not decipher their meaning that I [have] been the first to hear &quot;A purpose was behind Tesla described the signals as a repeating Decades later, Tesla was still convinced and had even deduced its origin. &quot;...the signals consisted in and subsequent study convinced me &quot;I believe the Martians used numbers for Then, in 1937, Tesla announced capable of not just interplanetary With such impressive technology at hand, Tesla felt &quot;[I intend to] claim &quot;I am just as sure the prize will be awarded to me &quot;They have got to do it.&quot; They didn't do it. The prize was, instead, As for the alleged message from Mars, While Earth was much quieter back in 1899, Who knows? Perhaps it was nothing Upon sailing into the shadow of Venus in 1975, The emissions were broadly consistent with Data gathered by subsequent missions are likewise yet fall short of any Presuming that lighting does occur on Venus, Well, it's been estimated would need to maintain a rate to yield a glow that's That's more than 20 times the mean rate on Earth In the blunt words of another paper: &quot;...lightning is not acceptable But in certain parts of the world there is another These vibrant curtains of light are the result colliding with the Could something akin to the Northern Lights Aurorae have indeed been it might seem like What makes it not so obvious is that the It is extremely weak and transient and is generated In spite of this, when caught in the path been observed to glow. The underlying mechanism of this glow is still between solar activity and diffused Not only that but there is a weak correlation According to author John Barentine, &quot;The data are inconclusive [but] there are &quot;The apparent spike in the number of correlates with one of the strongest While all of this sounds quite promising, Nothing conclusive has been found and, the Ashen Light has Until that happens, this nearly Should it be ascribed to the atmosphere Perhaps we should have listened to Perhaps it is nothing more The search for cosmic neighbors continues. Many scientists now believe that both Venus and Mars Perhaps a relict biosphere or the can still be found in There's mounting evidence that the Jovian along with Enceladus and Titan of Saturn, Could resilient microbes or even larger organisms Who knows, an apparent hut might, one day, match Even if Earth should prove the sole harbor every dot in the night sky And with the launch of the James Webb Telescope, Always remember that, if, at first,
