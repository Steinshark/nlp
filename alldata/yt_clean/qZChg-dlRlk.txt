Hello friends! Ukhta kitchen is with you. The first comment I read today was gratitude for these tomatoes and plums. And I really wanted to open the jar! We decided to make a delicious rice porridge or pilaf to go with these tomatoes. Who likes it more? Let's start right away. Place a frying pan or saucepan on the fire. I add a little melted butter to the frying pan and some vegetable oil, so that it covers the bottom well. Let it warm up. Meanwhile, I take a good piece of meat and cut it. I have a neck. Well, I think, for pieces like these. Straight marbled meat. We never have too much meat, of course. Give me more meat! You will eat meat, and I will eat porridge. But I think this will be enough. Seryozha, as soon as the oil in the frying pan is hot, I lay out the meat. Oh great! And fry until nicely browned. Meanwhile, I cut two small onions into small cubes. Once the meat smells delicious, you can turn it over. Oh, beauty! Let it continue to fry until all the liquid has evaporated and the meat becomes golden brown and beautiful. What can I do for now? And I can cut the carrots into cubes. And one more. Wow! I'm watching the meat, friends. When the meat has become rosy and appetizing, you can already take a piece of bread, salt and a piece of meat. I add vegetables - all the onions at once and then the carrots. Let them be friends here together. I stir. It smells, huh? It smells very tasty. So what? Here are the classics of the genre - meat, vegetables. All. And I fry everything together. I'll stir it from time to time. Well, now rice. I have 500 g of basmati. Of course, it needs to be washed very well. That's what we'll do now. By the way, it is recommended to rinse the rice with warm water, even a little hot. That's enough. Otherwise there will be no rice left. I keep an eye on the meat. How delicious! Let it fry for a few more minutes. Now let's open the jar and try what I was praised for. Okay, Seryozha, you did your best, you tried. Well done! What it smells like! Well, let's see how handsome they are. Tomatoes. The dense plum remained firm. I can hear from the smell that today you and I will eat this jar. Yes, sure. It smells very tasty. Now I want to try the marinade. They said it contains salt, sugar... You can drink it lightly. Very tasty. Well, let's try. I'll start with plum. In! It's hard to even tell that it's a plum. M? Try. I will try. Try. Yes. Now I understand. Sweet and sour, crispy. And tomatoes, friends, are very tasty! So thank you for your trust, feedback and your praise. It's delicious. Seryozha, come here now. Oh, everything is great! It's already fried and browned here. The taste will be amazing. Now I'll immediately add spices: a teaspoon of curry. Spices can be anything. A little turmeric, dry garlic and a good teaspoon of pilaf spices. And, of course, pepper, right? For you, my love. I stir until the spices warm up and release their aromas. They do it just fine in hot oil. Oh, how exactly we have such an oriental-oriental pilaf. I take the rice and spread it on top. Yes. I take water and pour it in so that it covers the rice. A little more on top. I always do this. Well , that's it, friends, by eye - right or left. Cover with a lid and bring to a boil. So, as soon as it boils, I taste the water for salt. It should be saltier than we are used to. I'm fine. I cover it again, turn the heat down to low, so it just flickers somewhere, and leave it for 40 minutes. I don't open the lid. Let it smolder there. In the meantime, I'll eat another tomato. Very tasty. Now we'll eat tomatoes, but who will eat porridge? You will eat. Well, I'll eat the cream then. For me, this is always the most difficult moment - to resist and not open the lid. Because it's very interesting what's there. That's it, time has passed. Oops! Wow! Yes. Now I take it and mix it. This is porridge. Look how beautiful she is. Absolutely gorgeous. Anyutka, will you be like this? Of course I will. And I will. Everything mixes well. Because it's a collar. If you have a different part, then, of course, it is better to simmer it for another 10-20 minutes. Cover with a lid, turn off the heat and let it brew a little, at least 15-20 minutes. It will still evaporate. Mine says: "Let's wait a little longer." I can't wait. I'm already hungry . Slice the bread. Give me some tomatoes. As I said, we will eat this jar today. Plums. Well, come on. The pilaf is already ours. Come on! And the pilaf is ready. Oops! Yes, I'm ready. All. Can pour. What a cool pilaf it turned out to be. He's gorgeous! Yes. It's either pilaf or porridge. I'm already drooling. Well, because it smells and looks delicious. Let's see the meat. Oh great! Almost to the fibers. Of course, if you wish, you can simmer it a little. M? Great. This is a collar. Well, now... Oh! In! Sun. Yes, even with these tomatoes. Or are you for the cream? I'll take the cream. In! This is delicious, friends. Home-made, simple and delicious. Like and share your recipes. And now we'll eat it all. Well, I wish everyone a peaceful sky, happiness, prosperity in the family, so that everything is fine with you in this world. Class! All. Sun. I'm eating. Yeah, cool. Well done. Well done you. You're just great. Apparently. Now you can see it. Simply wonderful weather. This is the view outside our window. Well, beauty! Beautiful. Very. And this is from the other side. And this is me. And this is Anya looking out. This is me enjoying the view. Oh, what a beautiful bird. Where? Oh, you're unlikely to see her. There he sits under the viburnum tree. So big and blue. Now I'll try to bring it closer. You understand, right? Where is she? Yeah. Yes. Well, she's not very visible. But in general she is very beautiful in real life. Yes, yes. In short, we need to hang up the feeder. Feeder. Yes. And feed the birds.
