[ wind ] &gt;&gt; A century ago, many looked at the Columbia Basin But a few dreamers saw that harsh landscape [ Music ] &gt;&gt; These visionaries of the Columbia River. The power to irrigate, and control flows But it would take decades of [ Music ] &gt;&gt; The first really active Billy Clapp, who was You know this is a long Western and try to get a settlement and try and get agriculture. &gt;&gt; An attorney from Clapp saw an untapped In 1917, he proposed damming Grand Coulee. He befriended Rufus Woods, publisher of the and Western attorney The threesome became and supported the that would pump irrigation &gt;&gt; People don't realize, but by 1900 virtually in the American West by the engineering community. They knew where the Grand Coulee, of course, was a of reservoir size and &gt;&gt; Opponents felt the cost of into the unpopulated high &gt;&gt; So there were a lot we'll never be able We'll never be able to use it.&quot; Well, of course, they &gt;&gt; The private power industry of in competition with them, and naturally they But there were many, many especially in the who thought the whole They thought that it was Who is going to use There is no market for &gt;&gt; Despite opposition, Bureau of Reclamation engineers to build a low dam This design, at 290 feet tall, Congress approved the $63 and build the dam's foundation. Now work lay ahead to begin transforming of the mighty Columbia River. [ water flows ] [ hammering ] &gt;&gt; On a hot summer's Sanpoil tribal chief while Washington governor This signaled the start of of the largest water It also marked the that would straddle and bridge the boundary line between tribal and [ gravel drops ] &gt;&gt; Six months later, the and his subcontractors Teams of men and heavy to scrape the area down and haul it away. &gt;&gt; Everything that's there to be removed, and there's of this stuff, and The overburden has to be carted down to the solid rock. At the Grand Coulee, &gt;&gt; Over 22 million cubic yards to be excavated before the The sheer size and scale of &gt;&gt; It wasn't an ordinary It was a monumental [ machinery ] &gt;&gt; Soon after work began, Mason, a consortium of companies won the construction bid The next several months brought supplied by the Washington which ironically was an Reclamation Chief Construction construction of Grand One of the first to provide the workforce Reclamation built to accommodate government while the construction laborers which was built by MWAK. &gt;&gt; When MWAK set up of course it was an They had barracks and housing for families Across the river of course for the engineers. They built permanent houses They had nice streets and for the engineers that The early construction times over the country. [ Music ] &gt;&gt; As the need for so did the need for housing. &gt;&gt; Something like 14 around the Grand &gt;&gt; The scope of the with the addition of a a bridge over the and the entire supporting [ Music ] &gt;&gt; Right after New the first steel pilings were forming a temporary dam The plan was to reroute around the construction site, using the Cofferdam's steel at bay so work could begin. &gt;&gt; There were a number of you'll never tame that river. You won't be able to do it. &gt;&gt; The Columbia River Nobody stops the Columbia River. The best you can do is on a to one side. That's the best you can do. And that's what they did. &gt;&gt; They did through an where they built this elongated, that blocked part of And then they began in that area once it Very clever technology &gt;&gt; It was winter, and the river making a Cofferdam Laborers called pile bucks of the Cofferdam into place, while steam-powered into the ground. &gt;&gt; They would drive these They would take steel sheets of the beams and let and drive them into the soil. And they'd stack the forming like a continuous &gt;&gt; The Cofferdams were the &gt;&gt; By late September, work But a new challenge [ earth crumbles ] Collapsing hillsides These abutments anchored the dam and upheld its structural Continuous hillside sloughing and hampered the &gt;&gt; They'd take out and a cubic yard would come And they couldn't deal &gt;&gt; In ancient times, the of Washington State blew which accumulated and formed very good This is called loess. It's a German word. The problem with Grand if you start digging in it, it It is very hard to dig out. It can get to be a very tedious The engineers came up with a of the hillside collapsing. They borrowed an old miner's &gt;&gt; The result was an that froze the east Standing 40 feet high, the and over 120 feet long. An ammonia solution kept and 10 degrees Fahrenheit It held the hillside together and the abutments Engineered estimated the frozen dollars in construct time alone. Grand Coulee was riding of construction technology. [ Music ] &gt;&gt; During that period of in the construction machinery. They got bigger and bigger and bigger trucks. There were all kinds of new to make it more efficient. Nobody else had hauled that and it was a great dam site. &gt;&gt; It was no surprise then at Grand Coulee became this time using giant conveyer Dirt, rock, and loose gravel to Rattlesnake Canyon on &gt;&gt; One of the solutions that with the overburden was to and they developed a rather onto which they could and have it shipped where it was out of the way. It was one of the innovations, and surprisingly enough to be an innovation of Grand Coulee Dam, concrete into the They became very good extensive conveyor belts. [ Music ] [ water jet ] &gt;&gt; With excavation underway, the so concrete would adhere to it As crews worked into the next construction placing concrete and lots of it. [ concrete ] &gt;&gt; Plans to build the almost use more concrete than any in the world at that time. &gt;&gt; The most unique thing about It's big. [ crowd cheers ] [ camera shutters ] &gt;&gt; On a cold day in December, Washington governor Clarence and a miner's cap, ceremoniously concrete placement. Then, working the fresh concrete for the press and The slurry was a precise mixture from the nearby Brett Pit. &gt;&gt; They got the aggregate They got the sand locally. In fact, they had a problem and they had to shake that where in order to get enough And that pile is still there. It's like a geographic feature. There is a comical pile of as the dam downstream of Grand &gt;&gt; To get good concrete, The glaciated deposits here And of course they would and then with those then they would make up with you know how and smaller aggregates and sand. So you knew the concrete if the batching was right. &gt;&gt; The concrete was into individual blocks To prevent the cement each block contained &gt;&gt; Concrete generates heat to use another trick to see that Again, they ran pipes in and they ran a saline so that it would cool evenly up as it generated heat. &gt;&gt; After each bucket was poured, to consolidate and and trapped air bubbles. Once complete, the next block &gt;&gt; It was just a whole series But before that could be to be sandblasted and cleaned and no dirt, no grease, It had to be fresh blasted to start off on so -- you know through between the blocks. It had to be one mass &gt;&gt; You could take your on that eat it off where they had cleaned it. They'd blow it. They'd dry it. They washed it would water. They'd scrub it if necessary. You could eat off it, and you That's how clean this &gt;&gt; While concrete crews were dam, a dramatic change for the dam's construction. After two years of Congress approved funds The additional height would revenues and help pay Now contractors were to build a dam 550 tall with The higher dam would not only but would also deliver and control springtime floods, protecting communities [ Music ] When complete, the up water almost 150 miles &gt;&gt; But when you look you're actually looking at two and the high dam [ machinery ] [ Music ] Sometimes in building, thousands 7, 8,000 people trying to stay out of each other's I suppose from a distance like an anthill with people with tram cars riding that were built, booms carrying and down, conveyor belts moving moving sand, moving &gt;&gt; If you're a worker there are a lot of problems. There are people moving and moving the cranes. The communication with all the noise The people directing the work and the crane operators So they will typically have standing off to the side. [ Music ] A crane operator frequently more than half the time can't on the crane is going, &gt;&gt; It would be difficult, You would be fatigued because with nothing but a half And basically you couldn't that you needed to stop they would replace you. There was no problem of that. This was the Depression, and that they could replace &gt;&gt; Thousands of Depression in their interest A steady stream of curious from across the country Grand Coulee was and its success was [ film projector ] [ Music ] &gt;&gt; Never in all history on a scale so colossal. The Public Works Program typified by the mighty on the Upper Columbia River, as to be almost inconceivable. &gt;&gt; They sold it as building This huge structure that was to work at a time of They talked about how from all 48 states came to in the construction, how workers to build this great dam. And there was pride in the United States building on the planet at a time of Great &gt;&gt; The program is sharing where only iron stretches The program is sharing limitless and faster industrial empire, to all the people Grand Coulee alone will than a million acres It will be the largest concentrated on the [ Music ] &gt;&gt; Movie news reels touted that and potential of the Columbia reality, and America &gt;&gt; It was a hot topic and there was nothing like it. It was just made to &gt;&gt; Grand Coulee was to the Roosevelt Administration because it was a big and in those days from news reels and They loved to feature [ Music ] It was a huge morale booster This was sort of the height because we were seen as when a lot of people [ Music ] &gt;&gt; The $130 million Grand Coulee is about to produce electricity With the blueprints turned into Governor Langley of to make dreams come true. The big moment arrives. The governor throws the of 18 giant generators begins The ultimate capacity and a half million horsepower, with lines of distribution [ Music ] [ water roaring ] &gt;&gt; On June 1st, 1942, over the completed spillway. Just 7 months earlier, [ gunfire ] [ explosions ] With America entering World War from developing irrigation to supplying power [ canon fire ] &gt;&gt; When December 7th came about what the country They postponed every to put people to &gt;&gt; For this was total war, and in the production line. We needed more ships, more guns, more shells. &gt;&gt; With the power plant and energy demand for war construction on the right so that the left powerhouse and generators could be Plans for irrigating the as energy production To that end, two generators were which was under construction, to accommodate the increased [ Music ] &gt;&gt; It was funneled into It was funneled into aircraft And it was also funneled into of disappeared into the where they were manufacturing for the atomic bombs. &gt;&gt; And that demand to increase after the war. &gt;&gt; Subsequently, the in the Pacific Northwest altered culture developed because for home keeping and lots of the country didn't Now by the end of the war, Grand It wasn't producing [ Music ] &gt;&gt; President Truman drives for the dedication ceremonies, for his cross-country Dedicating the dam's lake, Mr. Truman says the Grand Northwest is America's [ Music ] &gt;&gt; With the war over, for the West. Proponents of the Columbia Basin on expanding the potential &gt;&gt; The goal of irrigating the always there, just sidetracked The government then on building the pump of rather unique generators, up the hill and from up the hill in Banks Lake. The water can during peak down through these It's a very clever concept, into the lake to then into the irrigation project. &gt;&gt; Irrigation became a priority in the continual transformation It was an optimistic, And on May 7th, 1951, the nation-wide radio broadcast. &gt;&gt; Here comes the water rushing towards the dusty [ water roaring ] &gt;&gt; Thirty-four years after of the Great Columbia River, the Columbia Basin irrigation a reality. Now water flowed south to in central Washington, while and powered industries &gt;&gt; The Grand Coulee Dam is the on Donald Dunn's farm and on covering an area larger The dam was started 19 years But its land-saving duty had while all Grand Coulee power Now there is power and soon water will into the waiting to a million dead acres. &gt;&gt; With irrigation Grand Coulee entered Engineers believed an and greater coordination with new Canadian dams upstream Columbia's potential. A third power plant would and significantly enlarge generating capacity. &gt;&gt; They started working and they began working And the idea there was that in Canada. Those dams themselves and they could provide to Lake Roosevelt And so they could increase the &gt;&gt; The United States signed with Canada in 1964, and President Lyndon Johnson of the third power To make room for homes in Mason City built or moved. Then demolition teams and part of the dam itself. [ explosion ] &gt;&gt; But it was huge. I mean they blew the end off of Grand Coulee Dam We were impressed that they They'd used explosives to remove in order to make that channel. Now you know that's not the kind That's like performing That's -- that was really to do that economically. And well, you know It worked very well. &gt;&gt; Reclamation structural in the third power and designed for large capacity. After extending the crews set to work building that held six 40-foot diameter into stainless steel turbines The oversized turbine blades generators, weighing The new power plant hardware &gt;&gt; Don't forget. No one had built as big as Grand Coulee Dam. The shaft bolts on the third or 6 inches in diameter. The nuts, to move a nut for a on the shaft on the third and tapped the nut, and so they could lift They weigh hundreds of pounds. They are huge. &gt;&gt; Reclamation put to work engineers to expand the dam's Adding to the power world-famous architect Marcel to the power plant [ Music ] &gt;&gt; Columbia, Columbia, &gt;&gt; The race to put a man on the moon was no doubt of our increasingly with the Soviet Union. But while the world's on space exploration, the in another area, &gt;&gt; The third powerhouse was for Reclamation and because Russia had just put This sort of challenged to come up with a way &gt;&gt; They decided, well, can Can you make one that's -- Well, let's do 700. I mean it -- since they just make some big ones. &gt;&gt; And big they were, three 600 and three 700 megawatt in the third power plant Upgrades in the 1990s to an impressive 805 Today the third power of the energy produced &gt;&gt; The third powerhouse for a time was the largest And if you combined and right powerhouses it was a big power plant. &gt;&gt; It made you proud because it was a project that wasn't being It was one of a kind. &gt;&gt; Installation of the last completion of the third power of continuous construction, and activity at Grand Coulee.
