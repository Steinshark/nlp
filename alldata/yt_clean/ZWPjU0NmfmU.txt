The Book of Enoch is a text shrouded in mystery. Attributed to Enoch, the seventh patriarch from Adam, father of Methuselah and great-grandfather of Noah. It deals with celestial and supernatural themes that do not appear in other sacred texts. Its influence can be seen in things as different as Jewish Kabbalah, art and literature, in films and television series, and even in video games. That is why it is striking that it is not included in the sacred texts of most monotheistic religions. It is a universe where angels, giants and apocalyptic visions are crucial in the destiny of humanity. One of the most fascinating elements is the story about the Nephilim. They would be colossal beings that were born from the union between angels and human women. But the curiosity generated by this book goes much further. Today we explore the Book of Enoch, unraveling its mysteries, showing why what it tells is so surprising. Chapter 1. Historical context This text is attributed to Enoch, Noah's great-grandfather, a figure who occupies a unique place in Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions. It stands as a bridge between the earthly world and the heavenly realms, with an unparalleled vision of ancient thought. But the relevance of the Book of Enoch transcends its antiquity. It illuminates aspects of the ancient world that would otherwise remain in the shadows. This text is not included in the sacred writings of most religions, but its influence on early Christian writings is indisputable. It is a window into the beliefs of a bygone era, revealing how people of that time interpreted divinity. Although it is attributed to Enoch, it was written by various people over time, between the 3rd century BC and 1st century AD. It emerged in the midst of deep sociopolitical crises in the Middle East. During those centuries the Jewish people were subjected to various empires, including the Roman one. The Book of Enoch was born as a way to strengthen the cultural identity of the Jewish people. It tells the story of the creation of human beings and the origin of the fallen angels, showing the anguish that afflicted the Hebrews. It also talks about the origin of sin and the importance of the Messiah, prophesying the thousand-year reign of Christ after his second coming. It is considered fundamental to understanding where demons and nephilim, or giants, emerged from. It is important in Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions. Something that is evident in the mentions of Enoch in the Old Testament, where it is said that he was the son of Cain, grandson of Abraham and great-grandfather of Noah. In the New Testament, it is cited in the Epistles of Judas and Peter. Meanwhile, in Islamic tradition he is identified with the prophet Idris. In this way, it has contributed to several relevant trends: the end of the world, belief in angels and celestial travel. Chapter 2. The figure of Enoch In the book of Genesis of the Bible, Enoch is described as the seventh patriarch from Adam. But its appearance in the Bible is scarce, limiting itself to highlighting its longevity and its close relationship with God. However, there is one phrase from the holy book that has fueled centuries of speculation. "He walked faithfully with God; and then he disappeared, because God took him away." This mention of being carried by God, avoiding earthly death, gives Enoch a high spirituality. Thus, Enoch became a symbol of connection with the divine, of a life that transcends ordinary human mortality. This element of their history has resonated through generations, inspiring religious texts and artistic representations. The figure of Enoch is also crucial for being a mediator between the heavenly and earthly worlds. In the apocryphal texts, that is, those not accepted, he is portrayed as a messenger and spokesperson of divine secrets. He is someone to whom the mechanics of the cosmos, angelic history and the future destinies of humanity have been revealed. He was such a virtuous man that God decided to take him to heaven, avoiding death. It is said that he was directly promoted to angelic status. That is why he is associated with Yahweh's assistant, where one of his functions is to be his advisor. In some Judaic branches he became Metatron, a very powerful angel, of great rank in the celestial hierarchy, only below Yahweh. He is also recognized as having great wisdom, with advanced knowledge about the Universe and the Earth. The figure of Enoch is full of symbolism: he represents the continuous human search for knowledge, but also the desire for connection with divinity. For this reason, he is considered an inspiration for humanity, to transform its weaknesses into strengths. As a mediator between both worlds, it provides human beings with information about the Universe, being a bridge between God and humanity. Chapter 3. Origins and discoveries of the Book of Enoch Actually, what is called the Book of Enoch is a compilation of texts written at various times, between the 3rd century BC and the 1st century after Christ. 3 books are known. The First Book of Enoch (or 1 Enoch), the Second (2 Enoch) and the Third (3 Enoch). There is also the 4 Enoch or Coptic Enoch, of which only a few lines have survived, dating from the 5th century. But when talking about the Book of Enoch, reference is always made to 1 Enoch, which is the one that is complete. 1 Enoch was written by Jews belonging to the Hasidic and Pharisee schools. They wrote it in Hebrew and Aramaic. The only currently complete versions are in Ge'ez, a now extinct Semitic language that is the Ethiopian liturgical language. This Ethiopian version, probably made in the 6th century, is a translation from the Greek. In turn, the Greek text would be a translation of the Hebrew and Aramaic originals. The Greek translation was lost sometime in the 8th century. 1 Enoch was well known to early Christians, as seen by references in the Epistle of Jude, the Epistle of Barnabas, and Peter. Furthermore, in the early moments of Christianity, many fathers of the Church, such as Justin Martyr, Origen or Clement of Alexandria, cited it in their works. In the West it was considered lost until the 9th century, when the Byzantine monk Jorge Sincelo cited it in his "Chronography", but then it fell into oblivion again. Until, in 1773, the famous British naturalist, geographer and traveler James Bruce brought three copies of the Book of Enoch from Ethiopia to Europe. These specimens caused a sensation in the Western world. Many theologians began to study that text, surprised by its antiquity and information. The importance of the manuscript was not only religious: it provided extraordinary data about the ancient Semitic language in which it was written. And it was invaluable in understanding ancient Ethiopian culture. Chapter 4. Text structure 1 Enoch is a compendium of texts written at different historical moments. All of these books or sections have Enoch as a central figure in common, and revolve around his experiences and the revelations that God made to him. It is made up of 5 texts, well differentiated from each other: 1. Book of the Watchers. It covers chapters 1 to 36. 2. Book of Parables of Enoch (or Similarities of Enoch). From 37 to 71. 3. Astronomical book (or Book of Luminaries). From 72 to 82. 4. Book of dream visions (or Book of Dreams). From 83 to 90. 5. Epistle of Enoch, from 91 to 108. The Book of the Watchers was written between 200 and 160 BC. Talk about fallen angels. These angels came to earth and copulated with human women. With them they had children, the so-called giants or nephilim. This book talks about the sins that the Watchers committed and the punishments that God sent them. It anticipates the flood, and complements what Genesis tells about that cataclysm. The Book of Parables, or The Messiah and His Kingdom, was written after 63 BC. It prophesies the arrival of the Messiah and the fall of kings and powerful people. The Astronomical Book was written between 250 and 190 BC. Describes the ancient Hebrew solar calendar, according to the Book of Jubilees. It also describes the Universe, the stars and how the earth and the sky are supported. The Book of Dreams was written between 161 BC and 125 BC . Two dreams narrate the destruction of the Earth, human history and that of Israel. The Epistle of Enoch includes the Apocalypse of Weeks and some fragments. It was written after 135 BC. The Apocalypse of the Weeks tells the history of the world in 10 parts, 7 relating to the past and 3 relating to the future. The fragments may be the lost Book of Noah, according to historians. They were found in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Prophesy the sins of humanity and messianic times. Chapter 5. The Watchers The Watchers are fascinating characters in the Book of Enoch. They are called Grigori, which in Greek means "watchman" or "guardian." They are also known as "sons of Elohim", since they are nothing more and nothing less than angels. Elohim, in Hebrew, means God. These celestial beings asked permission to come down to Earth, and God granted it. His mission was to teach the law of God. There were many. According to the Book of Enoch, there were 2 million angels. Upon arrival, the Watchers were dazzled by the "daughters of the earth", the women. But they expressly disobeyed divine laws, and had sexual relations with them. With the women they fathered monstrous children, whom they called nephilim, or giants, considered demigods. But the Watchers didn't just copulate with women. They also taught men much of their advanced technology, which included creating weapons and warfare. This resulted in a great imbalance between humans, and between the heavenly and earthly worlds. Absolute chaos and the breaking of natural laws. That is why they are known as fallen angels, who brought corruption, violence, deception, witchcraft and sin to Earth. The Watchers fell into lust and arrogance. Although their origin is heavenly, they were capable of great mistakes and sins. So Yahweh decided to punish them. It is, therefore, the story of the fall of these angels and their punishments. Enoch details the names of his leaders, and the knowledge with which they were associated. For example, Araquiel provided knowledge about the land. Agniel taught everything about roots and herbs. Kokabel gave the names of the stars and taught astronomy. Penemuel passed on his knowledge of writing. Exael provided the technology to create weapons and war machines. Gadreel taught how to make weapons, and also many types of tools. And Kasdaye explained to women how to abort. Yahweh then sent the archangels to seize the Watchers and destroy their children, the Nephilim. And here Enoch enters, because the fallen angels asked him to intercede for them. However, your role is difficult, as you must make them understand that their sin was great, and that they will receive divine punishment due to their actions. The Watchers, chained, must contemplate the death of their own children in an unparalleled cataclysm, which will purify the Earth of sin. His punishment will be an example for humans who also disobey divine laws. Chapter 6. The children of angels: the nephilim The nephilim are the product of the relationships between fallen angels and human women. The Watchers maintained unnatural relationships with them, that is, they did not belong to the same dimension, since they were human, and they were of celestial origin. From a mythological point of view, giants belong to a primordial time. They are foundational beings, from when the heavenly and the earthly came together. The Nephilim are the fruit of these disastrous relationships, which brought a period of darkness to Earth and triggered an exemplary punishment. Its nature is hybrid, bringing good and bad things to humanity. They inherited advanced technologies from their fathers, and earthly instincts from their mothers. That meant a destabilization of the balance of the world. They tested the limits of what was natural and what was not. The nephilim symbolize the transgression of those limits, both physical and moral, and the consequences that follow from that. Its end is as tragic as its origin. Thanks to them, God decided to send a catastrophe of such magnitude that it could eliminate them and cleanse the Earth: the flood. This disaster would serve, according to the Book of Enoch, to root out the evil brought by the Watchers and their descendants. Disobedience could not remain unpunished, both for the fallen angels, who would see their children die, and for the nephilim, who would be eliminated. These mythical figures have appeared in other ancient civilizations, where giants are seen as irrational, semi-divine and powerful beings. But they are also the force between perfect creation and the breaking of laws, between chaos and order, or between the hybrid and the pure. They represent, in a sense, human nature and how their actions influence the world and everyone's lives. Chapter 7. Celestial Visions Celestial visions occupy a position of great importance. They are described with great detail and a wealth of great narrative force. The text delves into celestial territory, a world that escapes human understanding. Told in symbolic language, the visions show heaven as a physical place, and the Universe and cosmos in all their magnificence. It describes the abode of the righteous and chosen angels, where peace and imperturbable beauty reign. Another vision is the one referring to the punishment of the fallen angels, where desolation and pain reign. Enoch witnesses prodigious things: the pillars on which the sky is supported, the movement of stars or how lightning is formed. You are shown the mechanism of the seasons, the solar and lunar cycles, and how everything is kept in harmony. In this cosmogonic journey, Enoch receives certain revelations about the future of humanity, the arrival of a Messiah who will free the righteous people and the final judgment. Your journey is spiritual and also physical. That's why there are many details. As an example, he describes heaven as a place of different levels or realms, each with its own characteristics and inhabitants. These celestial realms are incomprehensibly beautiful, harmonious, full of light and indescribable colors. In these spaces the divine throne stands out, which is the symbol of the majesty and authority of God and his omniscient power. The throne is the central point of divine sovereignty. Around him, Enoch sees a multitude of angels, of different hierarchy and functions. Everyone is at the service and worship of God. These angels are messengers of the divine word, but also guardians of the law. They participate in the heavenly choir, whose melody contains and sustains the entire creation. Among the visions, he describes a river of fire flowing near the throne. It is not a destructive river, but represents the purifying power of God. He also sees celestial books where the actions of all beings in the Universe are recorded. They symbolize the omniscience of God, who sees everything and knows everything. The cosmos is a place of harmony, beauty and order, governed by "the true God", just, benevolent, powerful and merciful. His visions can be interpreted as profound teachings about the divine and the place of the human in creation. Chapter 8. Enoch, the mediator Enoch's most prominent role is that of mediator between angels and humans. It can act as a bridge that unites these two dimensions, transiting both worlds. He is capable of relating and interacting with celestial beings , and at the same time doing so with human beings. This role of mediator is expressed in various ways. On the one hand, he is the bearer of divine revelations that he receives on his heavenly travels. Not only does he say what has been revealed to him, he also interprets the messages to make sure they are understood. It would be like a kind of translator. On the other hand, he serves as the Watchers' intercessor before divinity. Despite having sinned, Enoch pities them and offers them a way to bring their repentance to Yahweh. This emphasizes his merciful side, capable of understanding the need for divine justice, and understanding error. This role of mediator also means the role of educator of humanity, as it reveals secrets of the Universe and the laws that must be followed to maintain harmony. Furthermore, through him humans learn the consequences of their actions, and also that there is the possibility of transforming and redeeming themselves. This possibility is expressed in his very nature, since upon being elevated to heaven, he received knowledge that transformed him. Although human in origin, Enoch shares divine traits. Therefore, it is a symbol of communication and union between two different worlds. Chapter 9. Prophecies and revelations The revelations that Enoch receives are not only announcements to give to humanity. It must convey what the consequences are of behavior contrary to divine laws. He also explains to them that following God will free them from eternal punishment. One of the most important prophecies is that of the final judgment, where each being will be judged for all their actions. This judgment will be held at the end of the Earth's existence. The righteous will receive their reward, and will live eternal life next to God. On the contrary, the wicked will have their punishment, which will also be eternal. Enoch prophesies the fall of kings and powerful people, of empires that subjugate the weak. Historically, it is interpreted as the liberation of the Jewish people. Another of the fundamental prophecies of the Book of Enoch concerns the arrival of the Messiah, a redeeming figure who will restore cosmic order. This Messiah is a strong leader, capable of implementing an era of peace, according to God's promises, and saving the chosen people. Enoch's revelations include the fall of rebellious angels, the punishment of the wicked, and a world where all actions have consequences. They emphasize that no act of evil will go unpunished, since the harmony of the cosmos will inevitably be restored. For this reason, the figure of the Messiah is essential, since through him we will enter messianic times, that is, his thousand-year kingdom. Chapter 10. The Travels of Enoch The Travels of Enoch are mysterious and fascinating stories that serve as a guide to an extraterrestrial world. Through his visions, he makes a series of celestial journeys, where he describes everything he sees. In them he receives revelations and prophecies that he must communicate to humans. These trips are possible for him because he did not die, "God took him away," thanks to his extreme virtue. This absence of death allows him to travel the limits between Earth and Heaven, and guide the mystical explorations of his story. The Book of Enoch narrates two journeys, referred to in chapters 17 to 19, and 21 to 36. On his first journey, Uriel guides him to the ends of the Earth, allowing him to see things that no human has seen. At the same time, it explains the interconnection that exists in the Universe. The angel takes him through space, where he sees the pillars of Heaven and Earth, the mouths of the abysses and the stars. It is on this trip when he witnesses the fall of the rebellious angels, and sees how they unite with human women. On his second journey, Enoch sees the final judgment. He knows that it is not just for the Watchers, but for all of humanity, that the spirits of the dead, good and evil, will be judged. He also knows the terrible place that serves as a prison for fallen angels: a great abyss of fire, which fills him with great sadness. He sees another place, also an abyss, with three deep grottoes, smooth and dark. This time, Archangel Raphael explains to him that the souls of the dead rest there awaiting the final judgment. It also describes four sections into which souls, righteous or sinful, are divided. These four sections are as follows: 1. The righteous who were persecuted and died an unjust death, whose example is Abel. 2. The rest of all the righteous. 3. Sinners who did not suffer any punishment in life. 4. Sinners persecuted during their lifetime, and were killed by other sinners. In the final judgment, the righteous of the first two sections will be resurrected and receive their eternal reward, which is to be at God's side. Those in section 3 will leave there and go to a worse place, to receive endless punishment. Those in section 4 are not going to be resurrected or come out of there, they will continue to suffer penalties, although lighter than those in section 3. But not everything is terrible. On this journey, Enoch discovers the Garden of Eden and the ends of the Earth, where there is a "land of aromas." These tours of the cosmos showed him the past, present and future of the Universe and humanity, which he would then have to communicate to human beings. Chapter 11. Symbolism and allegory The central figure of the text is Enoch, a pre-flood patriarch, father of Methuselah and great-grandfather of Noah. Because he was an extremely good man, "God took him" and he did not suffer death. There begins the symbolism of these texts, offering multiple perspectives of interpretation. The heavens are not simple physical spaces, but kingdoms or dimensions that have different levels of consciousness. Enoch's ascent to heaven is the human quest for wisdom and understanding of what lies beyond the earthly plane. The archangels that he finds in heaven, and the Watchers, or fallen angels, would represent opposing spiritual forces, that is, the fight between good and evil. In turn, the fall of the rebellious angels could be read as an allegory of human errors, and how they can lead people to suffering. Judgment and redemption would symbolize divine justice and mercy. His visions speak of retribution and the possibility of returning to the right path. One interpretation could be that ethics, as well as spirit, govern both the Universe and each of human lives. On the other hand, geographical features, such as mountains and rivers, or the stars themselves, can be seen as eternal principles or truths. In the case of stars, they are often interpreted as divine beings. Mountains are seen as spiritual challenges or elevated states of consciousness. Enoch's flow of knowledge from the divine to the earthly world could be a metaphor for enlightenment, through which a person opens himself to the truth. But it can also be seen as an allegory of the journey to the underworld, a recurring figure in many ancient civilizations. On the other hand, Enoch's visions can be interpreted as part of the history of Israel, as was the Maccabean revolt around 150 BC. Chapter 12. Influence on Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) Although the Book of Enoch is not included in the accepted books of most monotheistic religions, the influence it has had on them is undoubted. This mysterious work, replete with references to angels, apocalyptic prophecies and celestial visions, has shaped religious thought in various ways. That is why it is important to talk about its influence on Abrahamic religions. These religions are those that come from the patriarch Abraham, and would be Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Judaism is the oldest of the three religions. The Book of Enoch is part of what is called Jewish apocalyptic. In addition to apocalyptic literature, it also influenced other texts, such as the Book of Daniel. For the rabbis it was a source of debate and discussion. Although they accepted its importance, they did not include it in the set of sacred Hebrew texts. However, the story of angels, demons, and the cosmos were themes whose resonance is particularly seen in Jewish mysticism, or Kabbalah. In fact, the Third Book of Enoch would be one of the bases of Jewish Kabbalah. In Christianity the influence of the Book of Enoch is very noticeable. There are some references in the New Testament, such as in the Epistle of Judas, the best known. In this Epistle there is a direct reference to recognizing the history of fallen angels. On the other hand, notable parallels are noted between the prophecies of Enoch and those of the Book of Revelation, by Saint John. There are those who suggest that these ideas influenced the Christian belief in the end of times, or millenarianism. In Islam, the Book of Enoch is not expressly mentioned, but some themes have parallels with Islamic teachings. For example, Idris, an ancient prophet and patriarch of Islam mentioned in the Quran, is often associated with Enoch. Idris also received divine revelations. Likewise, the celestial ascension and the night journey appear in Islam, since Muhammad experienced them on a night in the year 621. EDITOR: DO NOT PUT IMAGES OF MUDHAM. Chapter 13. Apocryphal and canonical texts A canonical text is one that a religion accepts within its sacred writings. It is called canonical because it is part of the canon, or set of texts accepted by religion. On the contrary, an apocryphal text is a text that, for various reasons, is not included in the sacred writings. But it is not necessarily false. The Book of Enoch occupies a border space between canonical and apocryphal texts. Although Abrahamic religions recognize its value and authority, none have included it in their sacred texts. The only branch that accepts it as a main part of its scriptures is the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. In Judaism it is not part of the Tanakh, which are the 24 canonical Hebrew books, nor of the Septuagint, the Hebrew Bible. However, it influenced some Jewish sects, such as the Essenes, who emerged after the Maccabean revolt in the mid-2nd century BC. The Essenes, according to historians, valued the Book of Enoch. And although the rabbinic canon expressly excluded it, various later Jewish texts vindicate it. This is the case of apocalyptic and mystical literature, in the Jewish tradition. As for Christianity, although most of its religious traditions grant it historical and theological value, it is considered an apocryphal book. Chapter 14. The Universe according to the Book of Enoch The section titled "Astronomical Book" offers an interesting description of the Universe, which Enoch witnessed guided by the archangel Uriel. There, the patriarch carefully details the movement of the stars, the effect of the winds on the stars and the organization of the cosmos. He also makes a meticulous account of the ancient Hebrew solar calendar, which had 364 days divided into 4 seasons of 91 days each. Each season was made up of three months of 30 days, adding an additional day to the last month. The year had 52 weeks and always began on a Wednesday. This was in obedience to the text of Genesis, which indicated that on the fourth day, which was Wednesday, God had created the lights, the seasons, the days and the years. The Universe, on the other hand, is structured on several levels. This idea is not exclusive to the Book of Enoch, but its description offers very interesting data about its formation. There are 7 levels or heavens. In the first, natural phenomena such as rain, snow or winds originate . The climate is also controlled according to divine will. The second is a place of darkness and fire, which contains the prisons of the Watchers and where they await the final judgment. The third is like the Garden of Eden, where everything has indescribable beauty. There, the angels live in a state of contemplation and holiness. In the fourth, Enoch sees the celestial bodies, in addition to the Sun and the Moon, and understands their functioning. Each celestial element has its own purpose and trajectory. The fifth heaven represents the abode of warrior angels who prepare for battle. Here there is a heavenly order whose mission is to fight evil. Both the sixth and seventh heavens belong to the highest and most complex celestial hierarchy, with angels directly serving God. The seventh, as you can imagine, is the region that God inhabits, full of majesty. This structure of the Universe reveals a very strict hierarchical order, where each creature, at each level, fulfills a purpose in the divine plan or design. In this worldview, obedience, law enforcement, justice, and worship of God reflect the cosmic and moral order, connected since the beginning of time. However, the Universe is not isolated from humans. On the contrary, human actions are intertwined with celestial events, influencing them. That is why Enoch's revelations are so important, because they tell humanity what they must do to stay on the right path and maintain universal harmony. Chapter 15. Divine judgments: punishments and rewards in the afterlife In the Book of Enoch, punishments are essential for divine order to be restored in the world. Both human and celestial beings are subject to divine law, to which they owe absolute obedience. All actions generate a reaction in the environment, whether earthly or heavenly. Therefore, corrective measures are needed to restore harmony. The Watchers, led by Azazel, are described as the rebel angels who surrendered to human temptations and brought chaos and destruction to Earth. They transgressed all the limits established by divine law, and transmitted forbidden knowledge to humanity. The result was punishment: all the Watchers were chained and taken to the place where they await the final judgment, suffering punishment and torment for all eternity. But just as the wicked receive their punishment, so the righteous receive their reward. The righteous remain next to God, in paradise, without afflictions or pain. The divine justice that Enoch describes not only applies punishments, it also corrects and educates. Through punishments, humanity is taught to act correctly. Thus, every action has a consequence. If you act according to divine law, you receive the reward of being at God's side. But if one acts in a contrary way, the act is punished. On the other hand, in the Book of Enoch there is a complete justification for the universal flood, one of the greatest punishments that humanity has suffered. The flood became necessary to eradicate the evil that the Watchers brought to Earth, personified in the Nephilim. The only option was to exterminate them completely. So part of the Watchers' punishment included their own chaining and the sight of their children's deaths. Chapter 16. Literary style of the Book of Enoch Among all biblical literature, the Book of Enoch is considered a special work. Assumed as part of Jewish apocalypticism, its language emerges as unique in its time. Literally, it is a text of great symbolic richness, full of allegories intertwined with ethical and theological messages. It combines elements of apocalypticism, where prophetic texts abound, with mystical features, giving it a notable position in ancient religious literature. Although it was written at various historical moments, it maintains a thematic coherence that focuses on divine revelations, heavenly journeys, and the prophecies of Enoch. With simplicity and great descriptive power, the narrator takes the reader into an unknown, otherworldly and fantastic world. His visions offer many details, and do not have a merely narrative purpose, but rather serve to transmit moral and theological teachings. Metaphors and symbols are used to more accurately communicate divine messages. Which are best understood through striking visual language. The symbolism of the Book of Enoch encompasses elements of nature, as well as cosmic events and celestial figures. An example is represented in that angels and their actions symbolize various aspects of moral conduct and divine justice. Astronomical phenomena often represent elements of human destiny. All of this makes it possible to transmit effective messages about ethics that invite reflection. One of the most notable characteristics of his style has to do with the apocalyptic narrative, which emerges in times of crisis. Its objective is to console, bring hope and a sense of compensation and justice to the readers. In this sense, it has a utilitarian purpose. Beyond symbolism, the narrator strives to tell what he sees as simply as possible, so that the content is accessible to the intended audience. That is why it also has a didactic meaning, because through these visions we want to guide, teach and shape people's behavior. The combination of all these literary techniques has created a profound and unique work, which is still valid. Chapter 17. The Book of Enoch in popular culture Despite being rejected by most religions, the Book of Enoch has managed to endure in the human imagination. Thanks to this, its influence can be seen in various artistic manifestations, such as literature, television, cinema and art in general. Its narrative and symbolic richness has seduced artists throughout the centuries, offering humanity works related to mystical cosmology. In literature, its influence can be seen in the "Divine Comedy" by Dante Alighieri, with the conception of the circles of heaven, purgatory and hell. William Blake was a 19th century British poet, painter and printmaker, who illustrated the "Divine Comedy" and his own works. Deeply mystical, Blake collected themes of sin and redemption, of angels and demons, cosmic conflicts and celestial visions reminiscent of those of Enoch. More current, the influence of the Book of Enoch is also seen in the genres of science fiction, fantasy and horror, with characters with demonic or angelic features. The themes, especially those related to fallen angels and demons, serve to explore the conflict of good and evil, life and death. In cinema it has been very present, although indirectly, in films like "Constantine". And the television series "Supernatural" exposes the entire angelic story based on the story of Enoch. The influence of this ancient work can also be seen in video games. The video game "El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron" is loosely inspired by him. It is an adventure and action game where players assume the role of Enoch. Another interesting video game is "Darksiders", whose influence is clearly Judeo-Christian, with angels, demons and apocalypses in the style of the Book of Enoch. In painting and sculpture, its influence is seen more tangentially in the theme: fall and redemption, paradise and hell, chaos and creation. To name a few artists, in addition to William Blake, we can mention Bosch or Gustave Dore. The figure of Enoch is present throughout popular culture, even in the lottery game. The influence would come thanks to Kabbalah and numerology. Chapter 18. Differences between the Books of Enoch: Ethiopic, Slavic, Hebrew and fragments In addition to the Book of Enoch, or 1 Enoch, there are other books, namely: the Second Book of Enoch (2 Enoch), the Third Book of Enoch ( 3 Enoch) and Coptic Enoch (4 Enoch). 1 Enoch is the best known and studied. The Ethiopian translation is complete, which is why it is also called the Ethiopian Book of Enoch. It was excluded from the holy books of most monotheistic religions, but is included in the scriptures of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. The Ethiopian version was written in Ge'ez, the liturgical language of Ethiopia, used in religious rituals. Thanks to that, the Book of Enoch was preserved over time. Divided into 5 books, it narrates the fall of the Watchers, the prophecies of the final judgment and the arrival of the Messiah. It also includes a series of advice, teachings and warnings to humanity, which are the product of his visions and celestial journeys. The originality of the book is that it offers a multifaceted vision of the cosmos by interweaving mystical, moral and theological elements. The Second Book of Enoch is also known as "Slavic Enoch" or "Book of Secrets." It is not related to any of the other books, and philologists and historians claim that it was written around 70 AD. Some fragments of Russian sources have been preserved from this book, but it is known with certainty that they are translations of a Greek original, derived from Aramaic or Hebrew. It was discovered by Professor Matvej Sokolov in 1886, in the Belgrade Public Library. Enoch's journey through the 10 heavens and his meeting with Yahweh is recounted. God tells him to return to Earth and spread what he saw. These teachings last 30 days, then Enoch returns to heaven and becomes the angel Metatron. The Third Book of Enoch is also known as the " Hebrew Book of Enoch" or "Sefer Hekhalot" (Book of Palaces, in Hebrew). It tells of Enoch's ascension to heaven and his transformation into the angel Metatron. It is directly related to Jewish Kabbalah. The 4th Enoch or Coptic Enoch was written around the 5th century, and only very few fragments of the text have been found in this language. There is no more information about him. In addition to all these manuscripts, various fragments written in Greek, and even one in Latin, have been recovered. Chapter 19. Enoch in the esoteric tradition: alchemy, freemasonry and other traditions The attractive figure of Enoch has taken over various esoteric traditions. Enoch symbolizes hidden wisdom and the power to access divine knowledge. In alchemy, that ancient practice where elements of chemistry, philosophy, mysticism and astrology are combined, its influence is notable. Alchemists were looking for the philosopher's stone, a substance capable of transforming metals into gold and achieving immortality. In this context, Enoch represents spiritual enlightenment and access to higher wisdom. In fact, in some ancient alchemical texts, there are references that see him as someone whose knowledge allowed him to access divine secrets. For this reason, Enoch symbolizes, in alchemy, spiritual transformation and the aspiration for pure knowledge, a parallel to the transformation of metals. Freemasonry, on the other hand, gives it a more important role. In the rituals and teachings of the Scottish Rite, he would be a teacher of the most ancient wisdom. Various Masonic traditions relate the fact that Enoch, knowing that the flood will occur, hides the stone pillars where he recorded basic human knowledge. These pillars represent the preservation of knowledge and the idea that wisdom is the most solid foundation on which any society can be built. Symbolically, he is the seeker of truth for the Freemasons, the individual who accesses knowledge and saves it for the future. In other esoteric traditions, such as Hermeticism, Gnosticism and Kabbalah, his figure continues to dazzle. He is generally associated with Hermes Trismegistus, father of Hermeticism, and Metatron, the most powerful angel of Kabbalistics. Hermes Trismegistus is the symbol of the union of the human and the divine, and the mediator between heaven and earth. Metatron, for his part, is a powerful channel through which divine energies flow and the guide of mystics in their spiritual elevation. Interesting is the idea that Enoch not only represents the search for knowledge and spiritual transformation, but also that this comes to those who are ready. Chapter 20. The Book of Enoch in the mystical and occult tradition This work occupies a prominent place in the mystical and occult tradition, as it acts as a bridge between the known and the unknown. The celestial visions, the prophecies, the cosmic mysteries that abound in the Book of Enoch have fascinated mystics, assigning it an esoteric meaning. The book is considered a source of hidden knowledge that reveals to humanity the secrets of the cosmos, the celestial hierarchy and human destiny. As a spiritual traveler, Enoch transcended the limits of the physical world and experienced divine reality firsthand. Both mysticism and occultism take as true the descriptions of fallen angels, apocalyptic visions, and celestial journeys. They see in them a kind of cosmic map full of keys to understanding the dynamics that support material reality. The clearest example is in the theme of the fallen angels, who shared forbidden knowledge with humans. Occultists have interpreted it as the highest wisdom, which is accessed through transgression of the laws, which brings great danger to everyone. He is one of the emblematic figures of occultism. His ascension to heaven and his transformation into Metatron is an allegory of the initiatory journey. Therefore, he is the archetype of the initiate, of one who went through mysteries and reached a maximum degree of knowledge and wisdom. Its influence even reaches the rituals of ceremonial magic and divine magic, where angelic names are used and invoked. Precisely, those who seek to communicate with otherworldly entities often turn to the Book of Enoch, as a kind of spiritual manual. Chapter 21. Moral and spiritual teachings It has already been said that Enoch, because he was a man of great virtue and righteousness, was "carried away by God" without passing through death, and "walks at the side of God." In heaven, primordial concepts were revealed to him that he should transmit to humans according to God's command. These revelations cover topics such as justice, responsibility, mercy, sin and punishment. That is why they are indispensable for humanity. Moral and spiritual teachings refer to the ethical behavior that a person must maintain in their life to access divine grace. Every act, bad or good, has a consequence. If it is good, the reward is heaven. If it is evil, the punishment. Furthermore, all actions influence the celestial and earthly fabric, so that there is an interconnection between the created and the Creator. Bad actions destabilize the cosmos, and good actions maintain order. This means that every being in the Universe has a responsibility to fulfill to maintain the balance and harmony of creation. Another notable idea that is appreciated is the concept of redemption: repentance and cleansing of the soul are essential to access the kingdom of God. Compassion is another of his great teachings. By interceding for fallen angels, he teaches the value of mercy and empathy. In this way, obedience, righteousness, ethics, mercy and humility could be seen as the main lessons that emerge from the Book of Enoch. And, above all, the possibility of transforming into a new, wiser person, through knowledge and elevation of consciousness. Chapter 22. Conceptions of time and eternity The Book of Enoch describes a world where time and space are disrupted. Heaven is presented as a dimension where eternity is perceived differently. In the text, the past, present, and future are not a sequential line of events. Rather, time obeys a different cosmic order, where it flows simultaneously. Precisely, one of the most important concepts of the book is the differentiation between human time and cosmic time. Human beings perceive and experience time in a sequenced way, with limits. Cosmic time, in contrast, is a multidimensionality in which centuries and millennia last mere moments, and hours can seem like centuries. Time, then, is not a fixed notion, which flows in a single direction, it is something fluid that obeys the divine realm. As for eternity, it is approached as a realm where earthly temporality is annulled, celestial beings and God remain and divine truths are unalterable. By belonging to the human world and accessing the divine world, Enoch becomes a bridge between them, being able to see the separation of earthly and cosmic time. Finally, a redeemed time is also established in which restoration and harmony is possible, despite chaos and corruption. When the Universe once again aligns with divine justice and order, it will be time for final judgment. Chapter 23. Why was it excluded from the accepted sacred texts? There are several reasons why the Book of Enoch was excluded from both the Jewish and Christian holy books. In Judaism, it was rejected for not being aligned with the formal commandments of the Torah. They also did not accept the existence of fallen angels. The solar calendar that Enoch described contradicted the traditional Hebrew lunar calendar, which determines religious holidays. Furthermore, it coincided with a turn in Judaism towards an even more orthodox and radical monotheism. It was not accepted in Christianity either. Among other things, because of the question of authorship. One of the requirements to include a text as canonical is that the author and the text attributed to him be contemporaneous. That is, the writing was done during the author's lifetime. In the case of the book attributed to Enoch, the historical figure would have lived several thousand years before the text was written. Experts indicate that there were several writers of the Book of Enoch, over several centuries, and, within tradition, it is considered a book not "inspired" by God. Another cause for its exclusion was the content, explicitly seen as contrary to canonical writings. The influence of the Book of Enoch in early times of Christianity and Hellenic Judaism played a determining role in its exclusion from the sacred writings. The Church Fathers thought it contained many concepts that could be misinterpreted and lead to heresies. In the early Christian centuries, growing ecclesiastical authority began to establish more definite rules. He was concerned with theological coherence. Therefore, uniformity in teachings was essential to achieve a seamless religious system. Which led to rejecting unorthodox texts or texts that had controversial content, such as the Book of Enoch, which, for many, was full of myths and falsehoods. They assumed that the detailed descriptions of the heavenly kingdoms and the final judgment could lead to too radical interpretations. In the only Christian tradition where it was accepted was the Ethiopian one. It is part of both the sacred scriptures of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and the Jewish branch of that people. Chapter 24. Legacy of the Book of Enoch This ancient text has an enigmatic history, and its validity remains intact for several reasons. Its influence is undeniable in various theological and religious aspects, but also artistic and cultural. As a first point, the Book of Enoch provides a view into the cosmology and ancient beliefs of the Jewish people, concerned about their situation in the world. It provides a very complete and rich story about angels, giving specific names to each one. Additionally, it offers invaluable teachings about justice, ethical behavior, and the possibility of redemption. Its influence crossed the theological and religious fields and permeated literature and art for its aesthetic and narrative value. His meticulous and detailed descriptions of celestial beings, the stories of the Watchers' sin, and his profuse symbology inspired artists of all time. Although its origin is Jewish, its content was passed on to the early Christians and then to the Islamic ones. He jumped into Kabbalah, alchemy, Freemasonry, occultism and esotericism, demonstrating that spiritual history has the ability to unite different cultures. This work offers a powerful story about the search for truth and justice, inviting us to reflect on individual actions. Future generations have in this book countless examples of introspection processes, which can be applied to the contemporary world. Finally, it is a text that stimulates curiosity and imagination. For researchers and general readers, the Book of Enoch is still a source of awe and wonder.
