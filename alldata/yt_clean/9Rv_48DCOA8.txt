Amazing Korean Woodworking Craftsman&quot; The place I visited today is Hwaseong-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea. This is the 'Only One Tree In This World' workshop that produces resin tables. Here, craftsmen with 10 years of experience handcraft resin tables. "I don't create two things in this world." Imported wood is used to make most tables. The wood that will be used today is the 'Mapa Burl' tree, which creates unique patterns when healing wounds on its own. It has a complex and irregular shape. The carefully selected wood is loaded onto a truck and taken to the workshop. The tree was so large that it was carefully loaded onto the truck. Prepare for primary processing outside the workshop. It is large and heavy enough to require two adults to move. Flange saw A tool for cutting wood. Processing wood requires many tools. They use a wide variety of woodworking tools to achieve precise work. Mark the center of the tree before cutting. Check the vertical length. Draw a line in the center with a wooden stick. The lines were drawn straight and well. Raise the guide rail according to the line. Cut accurately using a plunge saw. After cutting, place both ends of the tree facing each other. horizontal cutting Likewise, cut using a guide rail and plunge saw. Smoothly cut cross section Trim the bark part with a grinder. (fight against dust) The shell has been completely removed Finish by applying the chemical. External work is completed. Come inside and move it to the previously prepared workbench. Level Look for areas that are not level. Mark the area to be carved out. First, shave off the protruding part with an electric plane. The curves were cut flat and well. Secure the tree so it does not move. Router that cuts wooden surfaces Cut the entire top surface evenly. Even fine details that are difficult to see with the eye are well refined. Dremel for carving wood gaps Craftsmen work delicately, not missing even the smallest gaps. Shake off any remaining debris. (wow) It looks like the pre-processing work was done neatly. Prepare various dyes to mix into epoxy resin. I'm already curious what color it will be. Epoxy Resin hardener Mix resin and hardener 2:1. Add a small amount of black ink Mixer Mix the resin and ink well. Artistically combining colorful dyes. Resin with a mysterious light has been completed. Pour the first resin It's a mysterious color. Secondary resin pouring Lastly, pour the third resin. It's as mysterious as the universe. Lift up and down several times to mix the resin well. Heavy wood and resin are added, so more strength is required. The darkest colored resin is poured to create a sense of depth. Remove air bubbles from the surface with a torch. Spray alcohol to create a drop pattern. heating gun Removes fine air bubbles. Secure the entire tree with clamps. Let it harden in this state for 3 days. Make sure the resin has hardened well. Pour additional resin into the space where the decorative stone will be placed. Spread evenly with your hands. It feels good to the touch. He prepares several types of decorative stones. First choose a large stone that doesn't exceed the height of the table. small stone It is placed in harmony with the large stone. Resin mixed with black ink Apply resin to the stone to prevent bubbles from forming through tiny holes. Also add pebbles mixed with resin. Spread evenly using a spatula. Materials that make up a sandy beach red sand Pour slowly along the shore. white sand The sandy beach is increasingly visible! Use a brush to spread it out for a natural look. It has become somewhat similar to a beach. Resin mixed with blue ink Expresses shallow water depth. Apply thinly with your hands for a delicate look. Melt and spread with a heat gun. Resin mixed with white ink Pour it on the sandy beach. A more colorful appearance It's time to express the waves. Draw a curve using a stick. Resin temperature measurement When the resin begins to harden, heat is generated. This is the best time to create wave shapes. It seems like a replica of an actual beach. Mix blue ink into the resin. Place in a deaerator and remove air bubbles for 40 minutes. The work is repeated several times. Pour the resin from which air bubbles have been removed last. It fills up thoroughly, neither too much nor too little. Remove remaining air bubbles Let it harden completely for the next step. Remove the side frame first. horizontal trim Cut the surface evenly. This is repeated for a very long time. Bottom plate removal Open the gap between the plywood frame and the table. It took me a few days to see this. Secure the rail to the end of the table. Cut the table edge smoothly. cutting corners The angled edges are well chiseled. 1st polishing First grind it coarsely. secondary polishing Grind it more finely. Spray with water and wipe the surface clean. polish Apply generously to the resin surface. Rub until smooth. natural oil Pour along the wood grain. The last step is to color the wood. It is finished meticulously. After a long journey, the only table in the world has been completed. This work preserves the smooth wood grain and adds artistic spirit. You will be dazzled by the smooth surface achieved through dozens of polishing operations. (Wow..
