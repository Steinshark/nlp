Welcome to Sad Boyz, a podcast - I'm Jarvis. [Ja] Hey, a regular opening. [Jo] Did me doing the [Ja] Oh, never mind. It wasn't regular. [JACOB] Yeah, it was good. [Ja] He was lip-syncing [Jo] Yeah, a lot of words [Ja] Yeah. He was saying, &quot;There's a [Jo] That's pretty far off. I did a really bad job. - [Ja] Yeah, I did. [Ja] It is weird. (laughs) bought a bunch of dinosaur bones. [Jo] Just spent all his money [Ja] And then had to do Didn't do The Beekeeper, though. To be fair, when I was like 19, to spend all my money - (clicks tongue) Perfect. - and worth half a billion dollars. - [Ja] I don't know if he was quite 60. [Jo] (cringes) It's less. [Ja] What if you &quot;Oop, where'd the money go?!&quot; - [Jo] It's a moth. [Jo] A moth flies out of my screen. [Ja] Yeah, it's like a CSS moth. - [Ja] It's like, um-- [Ja] Yeah, it does a perspective warp. - [Jo] &quot;Ahh! A train!&quot; [Ja] Oh, that would fuck me up [Ja] That'd be a good is get like a little fly but it's inside the computer. [Jo] Did you ever get where it would be like - that walks along your taskbar? - [Jo] This was circa 2002 or something. [Jo] You'd try and install and all of a sudden, Krystal has found her way [Jo] &quot;Hey, big boy. - Oh, I did try to play it. I tried. I don't think [Ja] My internet speed - [Jo] And now it's dead. Like Morpheus. - [Jo] Maybe. - [Jo] That's right. He ate shit. they were like, &quot;By the way, - [Ja] And everyone was like, &quot;No.&quot; [Ja] &quot;Wait, why is Morpheus in it?&quot; [Ja] I think it was more of [Jo] Literally, I thought it was Initially, before the movie came out, I think I even say that on air. I predicted that, like, &quot;Well, actually... He'll be in it.&quot; But no, it was a scheduling conflict. So they were just like, [Ja] Yeah. &quot;We'll get a different guy.&quot; &quot;Can we have Mahershala Ali? - He's busy too?!&quot; &quot;Blade?!&quot; (laughing) Yeah, &quot;Do you guys have Blade?&quot; &quot;Can we please have Blade?&quot; - [Jo] They don't even know his name. [Ja] I was looking at, um... a show... [Ja] Were we looking at an old show, and the cast and then [Ja] It was like an old sitcom. [Jo] He's in an episode of SVU [Jo] And he is, let me tell you, they waste no breath on, like... The show might as well - Just, like, he's... I believe it's in the same episode hip-hop star, and his manager is, quote, It's maybe the best show I can't stop watching it. [Ja] Yeah, he was in - [Jo] What the fuck? - [Jo] Oh my God. Ow! - [Ja] That's what I was thinking of. [Ja] OK. This was a show I remembered the show recently Shoutout, Linus. The show 4400 was... I think about some where only 4400 people, - [Jo] Oh! I do remember this vaguely. I think it was pre-Lost. I think it was pre- - But it was a-- [Ja] Depends on which multiverse. [Jo] &quot;Actually, if you were - sending you through dimensions...&quot; the Tesseract is a [Jo] A jock appears to beat us up. [Ja] &quot;Also known &quot;You might be surprised to know it was in &quot;And I've got an Infinity Bone - to pick with those filmmakers!&quot; - [Jo] There's a huge erection. [Ja] &quot;And I've got a boner! [Jo] I do vaguely remember this. - [Ja] Jacob, can you pull up The 4400? [Ja] Your face unlocked it, what the hell? [Jo] You won't believe who's on the line. - [Jo] Oh, yeah. [Ja] Like, look at that cast photo. [Ja] So, I was showing this to my friend, like, the top-right. [Ja] And I'm like, [Ja] &quot;It looks like they photoshopped [Jo] Wow, every single one of those - [Ja] Yeah. [Ja] AI's getting pretty good, actually. [Jo] Wow. God, they're just-- [Jo] What is she doing, by the way? - [Ja] Like, this guy? [Ja] This was like a Shining, you know, [Ja] She almost made it to X-Files. - [Jo] Dude, third callback for SVU, yeah. [Jo] Oh, he was gonna be [Ja] (laughing) Yeah, [Ja] Um, she was almost [Jo] I think that the - [Jo] Is that--? It's not-- - [Jo] Jacob, initiate 4400. [Jo] Flueger himself, Patrick Flueger? - [Ja] Flueger?! [Ja] Oh. The Fluegmeister?! [Jo] Can we see if the Fluegmeister - in Christian movies? [Ja] OK, open that in a new tab, [Jo] Wait, were there - [Ja] Maybe. - [JACOB] 45. <i>The comet, it's not a fly-by anymore. <i>- Is it supposed to be that bright? <i>- A comet cannot change course. <i>- Then it's not a comet. <i>(dramatic music builds, <i>I have over 4,000 people - [Ja] Ohh. <i>None of 'em have any memory <i>- I think I just saw your brother.</i> <i>- Shawn? <i>It's 1979.</i> <i>They're dead, aren't they?</i> <i>She's eight years old, - <i>[NARRATOR] The forsaken.</i> - <i>We need to isolate (inaudible)--</i> <i>...they're human beings.</i> - <i>[NARRATOR] The forbidden.</i> [Ja] OK. So... [Ja] I thought it was but in my defense, I think I was so I didn't have - [Jo] Have you watched The Leftovers? - [Jo] That is a great show. - [Jo] Yes, at least production. [Jo] But it is great high-concept. [Jo] It's literally the opposite. [Jo] I think it's like 2% of the [Jo] Which we come do with. Come on. [Ja] Or like, what was [Ja] Not Y: The Last Man, - [Jo] The guy that did Saga. [Ja] Oh, man. author... [Jo] Give me the first letter? [Ja] Yeah, give me the first letter. [JACOB] His name starts with a B. - [Ja] (whispering) B. - [Ja] B. B. [Ja] Bob. - [Jo] Is it Bob?! [Ja] What's the second letter? [JACOB] The second letter is R. [BOTH] Brian...! - [Jo] Michael Bendis?! No-- [Ja] Brian--it's not Brian... - [STAZ] Can I give you a tiny hint? [STAZ] He has a middle initial. - [Ja] Brian K... - [Ja] Goddamn. [Ja] I bring the K. I BROUGHT THE K! [Ja] I BROUGHT THE K, BABY! [Ja] I BROUGHT THE K! -[Jo] Wouldn't have got it without the K. [JACOB] Jarvis showing up - [Jo] (both laughing) &quot;I brought the K!&quot; - [Ja] I'm shaking. - [Ja] I'm shaking and I'm tired. [JACOB] Speaking of comets, that went over Portugal? [Ja] Yeah! I mean, I personally didn't - (Jarvis laughing) [Jo] I thought you said did you see the one (Jarvis laughing) [Ja] It was a Superman comic. [Jo] That would be such a classic [Ja] This is literally the fucking - [Jo] That is the same! [Ja] On The 4400! - [Ja] Portugal! - [Jo] That clip is-- did this in the early 2000s. [Jo] It was Portugal. [Ja] No, that actually is crazy. [Jo] It wasn't a comet in [Ja] No, it wasn't a comet. They're, like, - [Jo] Is that Tobey Maguire? - [Jo] Or something. of 4400 missing persons on a single day--&quot; [Ja] That's a great plot. - [Ja] Someone should reboot this. [Ja] I like that it's missing people, so it's like, &quot;Wait, [JACOB] This would do - [Ja] It would kill! - [Jo] Drops all at once, no 2nd season? [Ja] It would kill. I mean, this was-- It ran from 2004 to 2007, but I think it kinda got, like... [Ja] Lost kinda came in there from every show that had [Jo] 44 episodes for, like, a traditional mainstream drama in 2004 to 2007 [Ja] No. I mean, 'cause they [Jo] And still, it's one episode too many. - They could've done it. Bridgerton is the most popular - [JACOB] Apparently. - People are talking about it right now. - [Jo] Or whatever? - [Ja] Yeah. [Ja] Fuckin'... I'm gonna [Ja] Fall off the Earth that's flat. - [Jo] Whoa, hold on. OK. [Ja] Which is a thing I believe [Jo] Please don't get [Ja] It's so flat, dude. [Jo] You know, I know that [Jo] Does &quot;popularity&quot; mean it's - [JACOB] Yeah. [Ja] By the way, it's on the way down, which I think is understandable, as a show that came out 30 years ago. [Jo] This is probably the most press [Jo] 141 episodes of Young Sheldon? - [Jo] How old's this fucking kid?! [Jo] How old's this kid gonna get? [Jo] What's the deal with this kid?! [Ja] I do like the idea that, like, 141 days is not that much, so what, to you, [Ja] Like 141 years?! What is he, [Jo] This guy has magic or some shit?! [STAZ] Did you watch - [Jo] Of Young Sheldon? Of course. [Jo] Are you insane? [STAZ] And The Good Doctor. - They had a duo ending. That's the final episode. He goes there; - [STAZ] Really? [Ja] How long until they [Jo] Yeah, just &quot;Guy.&quot; - [STAZ] Elderly Sheldon. The Small Bang Theory. The Bang! (laughs) Young Bigbang. [Ja] Shelled In. [Ja] It's a show about... - uh, a bomb shelter... where only... only a few people survived, - [Ja] And they live in the vaults. - [Ja] They live... [Ja] They live--it's kinda like Let's watch some Fallout - [Ja] FUUUUUCK! Dude! [Ja] Also, at the end of the show, we are going to show a little preview - of the new Sad Boyz branding. [Ja] Uh, because we... have been working [Ja] Our existing Sad Boyz branding we used free assets online, but we don't own it, so we can't, like... [Ja] I would feel uncomfortable and selling anything like that. [Ja] And as we're gearing up with a visual identity that we own, we've been working with and we landed on and so that's gonna start [Ja] But we wanna - [Jo] Don't worry. [Ja] Just little visual differences. Some [Ja] So it's still the same show, 'cause we're excited about it, one, [Ja] And we'll do that [Ja] Um... so yesterday, - [Jo] Nerd. Karen Han and Brian David Gilbert. [Ja] And I had a card that--(laughs) [Ja] I had a card that, every time summoned a 2/2 flying drake token. [Jo] Respect. [Ja] And every time I summoned one, I'd be like, &quot;Heh-heh, you might need some [Ja] I just kept making that joke - over and over. - [Jo] They're refusing to acknowledge it. and I was like, &quot;You're gonna need - [Jo] &quot;As you recall.&quot; - [Jo] &quot;Right.&quot; - [Jo] &quot;Come back. Let me in.&quot; - [Jo] &quot;I wanna play Magic. Come on.&quot; [Jo] How was the game? [Jo] Magic Jarvis is back. Magic Jarvis has returned. For those who don't know, was magicjarvis, is magicjarvis, because when I signed up for RuneScape I didn't know how MMOs worked, and so I wanted my friends to know that it was their friend Jarvis and thus magicjarvis was born. People think it's related to People think I do magic. I don't. Um... (laughs) And, uh, yeah. So I was really into Magic as a child, as a young buck, uh... The player. I was really into Magic Johnson Uh, no, but I got back into Magic recently 'cause I was playing and I was like, &quot;It's time for me 'cause usually I just play - And, uh-- &quot;It's just one last job.&quot; [Ja] As Simple Plan, or maybe it was another band I was, uh, much like their maybe 2003, (both laughing) - [Jo] It's night. * In too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep-- - [Jo] Sum 41. [Jo] Hold on. Oh, there's also one [Ja] I did not mean Genesis. [Ja] Not to be confused with the [Ja] Not that I'm that old. [Ja] But a family member gifted it to me. [Jo] Fellas. We're both young, OK? - [Ja] Yeah. [Ja] Uh... I was just listening to &quot;Oh, we have the same experiences [Jo] I actually created queer pop. - [Ja] Oh, yeah. she's been doing. (both laughing) [Jo] I started to do that (both laughing) [Jo] I can't, I-- [Jo] I liked one reel of it, [Ja] Ugh, I said I wouldn't talk about it. [Jo] It's really scary! [Ja] I said I wouldn't talk about it. [Jo] It's like a dislocation dance. [Jo] I don't have the tissue, like, density to be able to do that. [Jo] My shoulder would fly off. [Ja] I'm too old to comment and she's doing just fine. - [Jo] She's doing a scary dance! [Ja] Everyone is coming into their own and becoming an adult-- [Jo] No reason to bully this person, or definitely not laugh at [Ja] Leave them alone. It's not my-- [JACOB] She just turned 21. - [Ja] No, it doesn't make it any better. [Jo] Now you can drink! [Ja] And did I see the video of... her getting drunk at Disney World and asking people to sing and they didn't know the song? - (Jarvis sighs) [Ja] Unrelated, though, Brit Smith, a very underrated pop singer has a song called &quot;Karma&quot; that is delectable. Recently, - due to something. [Ja] Yeah. And it was climbing the charts, and I was like, &quot;Damn, [Ja] And that's all I'll say about that. [Jo] And what a... It's remarkable there's and also, who is Jojo Siwa? [Ja] Who even is that? [Ja] However, I will say [Ja] Uh, by Brit Smith and - [Ja] Uh, I-- not scary dances associated with it. [Ja] Yeah, Brit Smith - so I don't know what you mean. [Ja] So, uh, I... love a boy band. [Ja] And I wasn't a One Direction guy; I was more of the old-school. [Ja] Not Backstreet Boys, - [Ja] And I chose my side. - [Jo] A loyal follower. [Ja] You know the show Glee? - [Jo] I do. the wheelchair kid from Glee, not NBA player Kevin McHale? [Jo] And he is, I believe, [Ja] That's true. In fact, which stood for Not Like Them, and they have a song called &quot;Karma&quot; that is also produced by Timbaland. [Ja] So am I to believe Timbaland was just around, producing any fucking song [Ja] NLT, &quot;Karma.&quot; I don't know [Jo] Wait, is it possible at all... to ground this as something that he offered it to one side, and then sort of ordered - offered it to another person? at least of Brit Smith's &quot;Karma&quot; by another artist because they're a - have a voice in their, you know, coming-of-age and coming [Ja] We all do silly things, - and that's fine. [Ja] Sometimes silly dance, and it's fine. [Ja] So, I learned the [Ja] Um... [Ja] And I feel like the lead singer should've been a - 'cause he... [Ja] No, he was the number-two. [Ja] He was the JC Chasez [Ja] I know some people wanna say but it's just like, is all I wanna say. [Ja] Also, this guy, Travis Garland, I feel like he had it all. [Jo] Whoa, what's going on with - [Jo] That's a fit. Respect. [Ja] V, I think his name is? [STAZ] Do you think there's about this &quot;Karma&quot; song, Timbaland...? - [Ja] There's gotta be. [Ja] I'm sure that song's 'cause even though that band and never even released an album, uh... [STAZ] Like, Capitol Records - [Ja] Yeah. - [Ja] Yeah, we'll just do little parts. [Ja] So, if you're just haphazardly cut around the music, it's because I did stop the show to relearn the choreography to a 2007 boy band... uh, dance move of a boy band Just a few singles and a dream. There was an album leaked, I had it. I have it to this day. [Ja] Second of all, do you wanna guess how many active monthly on Spotify? Four--three hundred thousand. Jordan, I'm gonna show you - [STAZ] What is it? - [Ja] 14,000 people. [Ja] It's so few people. [Ja] Each of those songs has For all the die-hards, I wanna see that number go up Their album, the only way is to look at the leaks on YouTube, or to be me and have back in the year 2010. [STAZ] I do have to say, though, kinda doesn't mean anything, you'll be like, &quot;What song is this?&quot; - all lyrics perfectly. [STAZ] I'm like, &quot;Oh, yeah, that's [STAZ] And you're like, - [Ja] Yeah, I don't know. legend brain. Like, being a-- Where you just remember Yeah, I love myth. (laughs) [Jo] Anastasia, you got girl brain. - [STAZ] Yeah, I've got girl brain. [Jo] I play action figures; [STAZ] Yeah, it means I play with Barbie, - I do laundry, and... (laughs) - [Jo] &quot;Play with dishes.&quot; [Jo] That is maybe the weakest, like... boring person sexist zinger mark the bingo card-- is, uh, &quot;Go to kitchen, [Jo] Like, &quot;You're still doing this?&quot; - [Ja] Yeah, it's wild. [Ja] Yeah. There's a lot of jokes that... [Ja] I mean--(laughs) [Jo] &quot;Look between A and D I saw people talking about &quot;Damn, are we still doing sportsball?&quot; [STAZ] Did you see Harrison... Butker? I think his name is? [STAZ] He did this - at a Catholic school, college. [Ja] Harrison Butker, the football kicker-- [Ja] &quot;The football kicker.&quot; The NFL - [STAZ] Mmhmm. - [Ja] Super Bowl winner. - [Jo] It would make more sense. [STAZ] But he gave this sexist, racist, - [Ja] Everything. - horrible stuff in there as possible. uh, (beep). Uh, those guys. [STAZ] He said something-- [STAZ] The thing that stuck in my brain, 'cause I didn't see the whole speech, - [Jo] Just the parts you agree with? [STAZ] The part I agreed with - [Ja] He said, &quot;Hi, I'm Harrison Butker.&quot; that their career is unimportant until they become wives and mothers, - and that's their real important career. - [Jo] That's really nice. - is an accomplished physicist. [Jo] Well, yeah, she was accomplished - 'cause she said babies. [Ja] Also, I know what &quot;Sad Boyz have nothing - Why are they talking about this?&quot; [Ja] And what I have to is that Harrison Butker... was the kicker... - of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. [Ja] And we overlapped - [STAZ] You went to college with him? - [Jo] Go bees. every week during the football season. [Ja] And I never heard [STAZ] Did you make fun of his last name? - [Ja] Every single time. also touched on pride, - 'dangerous gender ideologies'&quot;-- How did he hit all these topics? [Jo] This is what He doesn't have the jajones to do-- Oh, and &quot;Catholic There's a level of, um, conservatism, like traditional like not even political conservatism. I just mean traditional family It gets to a level where I don't Like, when you say &quot;Benedictine,&quot; [Ja] Pope Benedict? Or... - [Ja] Or is there like--I don't know. you know, it's nice to hear It's nice to see passion. And then they start talking really or Homestuck or &quot;Oof, I don't know these characters.&quot; &quot;You remember that episode of [Ja] Also, a lot of times people &quot;Oh, they don't want They want them all And it's like, we want [STAZ] We want women - [Ja] To not be forced into-- - is to stop having this conversation. I'd like for no one to - [STAZ] Yeah. is just around not wanting it. [Jo] I don't--trans people [Jo] They're not asking for you [Jo] They're asking for you to not... - you know, endanger their existence, uh, prohibit their ability to live - instead they're like, &quot;What, I gotta get a tattoo that says [Jo] No, not really. [Jo] &quot;I have to get a grill that announces both my date of birth and [Jo] Not particularly, no. &quot;Oh.&quot; - (Staz laughs) I wanted to find this Elon tweet. [Ja] I think one of the biggest issues is that nobody wants to hear anyone out - or listen anymore, and so, like, I don't give a fucking flying shit - [Jo] (laughing) Yeah. that was called &quot;The Racial Bias [Ja] Uh, &quot;Sarah Lewis between racism and the camera.&quot; - [Ja] And I'm like... - that might have a take? [Ja] But when I see that, I go, &quot;Oh, OK.&quot; It's a look through and, like, how there's much like if you were to take you can't ignore the role because even if you-- EVEN in the most charitable case, where you believe that you tend to believe - [Jo] Yes. - hear that person out? why would you not just say, &quot;Huh, interesting op-ed. If I don't, I certainly Yeah. But what's interesting and specifically Elon, - is that, like-- For as much as they love intellectualism, - or at least in theory-- the aesthetics of it-- anyone else's dissenting thoughts. They just completely say, &quot;You're annoying me. Elon said, &quot;The 'New Woke Times' - I'm like, &quot;This is a headline, my guy.&quot; [Ja] Yeah. He needs a new &quot;It is truly unreadable. I have to pay The screenshot's blurry. Like, &quot;Wait, [Jo] &quot;What the hell did you do?&quot; [Ja] He has corrective [Jo] (laughs) He puts his contact on them. [STAZ] There's no possible scenario - [Ja] Because... - (Staz laughs) [Ja] (laughs) It's actually, uh-- [Ja] It's been translated [Ja] And so you have to in order to turn it into non-gobbledygook. Elon building an Enigma machine just a single Washington Post article. [STAZ] Should we create a newspaper [STAZ] It kind of is a good name. - [Ja] It kinda sounds like, um-- [JACOB] (baby voice) &quot;Um, [J&amp;J] &quot;New Woke Times.&quot; It kinda feels like the name of, like, a backpacker hip-hop album - from the early 2000s. [Ja] Like, before &quot;woke&quot; had been Or, no, turned into, like-- - You know what I mean. It was always a political word. [Jo] &quot;But those New Woke Times - and it's sat at a cafeteria. called &quot;New York Times.&quot; Um... and then he rhymes - and I go, &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;Dudes will see this and go 'yeah,'&quot; [Jo] Our version of &quot;How often do you - &quot;How often do you think about Cole?&quot; &quot;How often do you There's a lot of J. Cole lyrics There's a lot of bad ones but then there's a lot of fun ones. Like when he says, &quot;I'm the shit, No, that was Kanye. - [JACOB] Ice Spice. Cole has a doodoo line or two, no? Oh, plenty. I mean, like a kinda transphobic line - on his recent project. Yeah, it's like, And it's like, he hasn't I'm willing to give some but it's just hard to imagine, He has a lot of lines that go-- not a lot-a lot, but using the F-slur and things like that. And it's, you know... I'm not one to throw the but it is, uh, annoying at the very least. The most generous things you can say I won't even say slip-up, 'cause benefit of the doubt, but... Uh, I'd say it's intentional. It's meant to be smart, but it comes off as someone - queer people in their circle, and then makes, um... and then makes really... Like, is attempting to be intellectual, - and then comes off not that at all. by deliberately walking on ice. [Ja] Yeah, it's like the lyrics of Kendrick's song, right? [Jo] So embarrassing. [Ja] Exactly, and that's how I feel [Ja] There's like a 10-year-old lyric [Ja] And it's not my place to sort of say, &quot;Oh, I don't feel like it was but it was said in this other way.&quot; Not being a member of really offer-- I don't think my opinion compared to someone else. So-- Yeah, a single statement from somebody - [Jo] &quot;Understood.&quot; Take the authority. &quot;Don't even try.&quot; You know? Like, you could literally-- It's, uh, you've walked into-- It feels to me like, um... If it's not hate, and I personally don't believe it's hate, like, intended to be hate. But again, it's not my... I'm not the authority on this. [Ja] But it feels like that you feel like you are and sort of course through it - and navigate it, in a way. [Ja] Uh, and you have the hubris in a way that, um... somehow doesn't upset, - [Ja] And absolutely, you are wrong. [Ja] And it only upset-- It basically is wack to people who don't care about the sort of and then for people who do care, It makes you look uninformed. I think that's maybe what being like, &quot;I don't give a shit&quot; That stops being impressive Like, &quot;I don't even [Ja] You know what it is? think that they're smart enough but they're white. [Jo] Yeah, it's words. - [Jo] It's all about context. [Jo] I'm like, yeah, of course that's [Jo] It's an easier way to live. And you can reconcile to try and impress that one kid [Ja] Again, it's like, uh... [Ja] It's, um, not my place to speak on, um, as an authority, so I can't do that. I just, you know, grew up listening to this artist and have a personal [Ja] I don't fucking [Jo] I mean, I feel fucking... This is a way more severe, but the journey that Ricky Gervais him and Stephen Merchant - when I was a kid to, like, [Jo] Stephen Merchant stepping back from the public eye and then playing Caliban Then just... Ugh, I have tried to watch I don't know, the last, what is it, And it's just hack. It's just not--I don't even care. Fine. I can try and look at Sometimes I'll see a... YouTube Short of a comedian and they happen to just But he's so... upset that he can't-- It's why conservative comedy because they just can't... They can't, uh, because they start before they're able to [Jo] Like if, I don't know, the Papyrus sketch, the Papyrus sketch from SNL, instead Ryan Gosling--Ryan Gosling? Yeah. [Jo] Ryan Gosling just - to do any jokes. [Jo] He just starts going, &quot;It's overused! - [Ja] Yeah. [Ja] Anyway, uh... (Jordan imitating motorcycle revving, - [Ja] What were we talking about? - [Ja] Wazzup? - I'm good. I'm fine. I'm okay. - Uh... - [Ja] I'm... passable. [Ja] I'm... a little teapot. - [Jo] (laughs) &quot;I'm short.&quot; - [Jo] &quot;I'm stout.&quot; [Jo] &quot;My wheels on the bus...&quot; Have been better. I think last week I've just been having trouble, like, getting started with just my day. [Ja] Like, it's so easy to just [Ja] And then the day's mostly gone and I haven't done and I'm like, &quot;Ahhh.&quot; [Ja] And, um... [Ja] So that's been rough. [Ja] I wanna get back to the-- [Ja] I got boxing today. [Ja] Um... [Ja] I've been balling, but not as much, so I wanna get back at that. [Jo] Does that feel like you're kinda trading the real estate between... It's like you're at 100% capacity and you wanna do less boxing, more...? No, you know what? and that's where I have to a lot of... the last few years, I've... reduced the activities that I'm doing, and I'm just not doing And I think it's possible, and 'Cause I'm also still dealing on the previous episode, be patient, [and know] that not - Uh, but-- And I can see progress, yeah. - I, um... True. It's like... You know, it's a little bit like I would give that to any friend, but it's hard to give it I recently hit up Anastasia can you just come over and so I can get a start on my day, so I can get showered and - or at least out of my bed?&quot; Um, 'cause one of the things is getting up and going, - and then being out. it wasn't even like an office-office, but when we went on in the morning, and even just sick. I was doing so much work because my brain was being Like, no one's yelling but everyone's kinda chilling out. [Jo] You feel time. because I get a lot of anxiety... pre-anxiety about socializing. Usually, my social anxiety occurs in between socializing and not during. - If that makes sense? - It's like, I can-- - [Jo] Like, post-hanging out? Like, you were talking which we mentioned on the Stanz episode, so I think we can talk about it. But, like, when we were... in that, the green room for that, it was like, &quot;Oh, OK, I'm socializing, And then there'd be some dead air, and then I'd start to get nervous [Jo] Oh, I see. Literally in the hang. [Ja] It's like every - [Jo] Around? [Ja] It's like different - [Ja] It's like, (staccato notes)... [Ja] And I'm like, &quot;Fuck, [Jo] Yeah, going to a party [Jo] Like, &quot;Wait, this has to be Um, but I have been and I'm proud of myself for that. And I've just been doing I think I talked about just my life became such a hermit version of what it once was when I simultaneously left my normal job and then also the pandemic happened. [Ja] And all of my - [Jo] Yeah. rebuild that confidence. [Jo] It's especially difficult a Zach, a friend we used to - &quot;We're going to the bar after work.&quot; - Like, &quot;Thank you, Zach.&quot; And you've been helpful you know, been like, &quot;Hey, And a lot of times, that'll be and last year when I was under no circumstance could I go I would just have to go home or order food I wasn't supposed to order. Um... - But never two different Uber Eats. but some people were giving &quot;Oh, it sounds like you need to have And I'm like, &quot;Yo. Yo. I have them.&quot; That's not the issue. The issue is the specific craving The craving that only And you know that that's wrong and so you try to create, you know, uh... things that make it I would love to eventually That would be--that would be, like, ascending to superhuman or something. [Ja] But even still, I've been drinking and I haven't had soda in a few months, but I know that soda is a vector for me to over-consume. Soda is a very quick kinda mini version Or not even one soda, - but, &quot;What if I drank a whole 12-pack?&quot; And even diet soda's like a [Ja] Like, I actually went over to [Ja] Did their podcast and a stream, um, doing Creators for Palestine [Ja] Which, by the way, check it out. - [Ja] We put a link in the description. [Ja] Yeah, it's been going well. [Ja] And shoutout to Nikki and Chad Chad and, um, Hassan and... Stanzi, and just who's been helping out a lot. [Ja] And shoutout to all the creators [Ja] That's been super cool. [Ja] And I'm just a connector. [Ja] I'm just helping, signal-boosting, [Ja] Uh, and then lending [Ja] So, you know, I was [Ja] And I was like, sitting with Ted in his kitchen before we came on, and Hasan's whole pantry [Ja] It was full of, like, [Ja] I saw, like... [Ja] And more organized, 'cause - [Jo] Sure, he's in the military. he basically is in the where it's like, &quot;I wake up, I do my--&quot; [Ja] And if anything is out of whack, &quot;Hey, guys. I can't stream today.&quot; He's, like, naked. Bare chest. He's like, &quot;I can't stream today, [Ja] &quot;I don't frickin' know - [Ja] &quot;How do--do I--what do I...?&quot; [Ja] &quot;How do I do this?&quot; But he's so regimented that, that's a weird day for him. But, uh... he had all of the Quest foods, like the Quest peanut butter cups, You know, they're, uh, like keto peanut butter cups, I wish it wouldn't tell me. - [Ja] YES, I do know what you mean! - 'Cause I was keto for a while. Decent enough. Helpful in that case. - But just don't even set me up. You get a Sweetgreen salad, - little treats and stuff? - I need someone to break into my house... [Ja] Open all of the health foods I have, - or put them in a high-end... [Ja] Instead of, &quot;This is - the Quest protein tortilla chip,&quot; instead they were like, that's full of godly ingredients that will make you taste &quot;become Kylie Jenner.&quot; [Jo] Yeah, just put a bunch of, like, vegan protein powder in a Froot Loops box. - [Ja] Yeah. So anyway, I see a lot of that. I see a bunch of alkaline water, which I don't think I just like the taste. Um, and then, also, every diet soda one can imagine, and then also the, uh, what I call &quot;dad Coke&quot; or &quot;night Coke,&quot; - [Jo] Cocaine! - Um... [Ja] Yeah. It's the gold cans, the diet caffeine-free, because when you want but you don't wanna stay up, you gotta crack into that. I'm just drinking water and my Liquid IV but, uh... I was like, &quot;This would be me if Which is--you're making all the steps but that's almost even more... for a little bit of time, it's like you start... - You're back at the gym, and you know that's but also you wanna get back to 'cause you've reminded yourself And I've been going out and drinking a and so I know that the going out like going on dates and things like that. And so, uh... So I'm like, just trying to I need to identify, like, versus what is a habit and a pattern. [Ja] But one thing that's getting me down in the interest of is I wanted to talk about [Ja] Because the show right now analytics are a little bit down, and that's OK, and that's as we're building and we're learning. It's not a show-stopping But, uh, one thing we are trying to do is figure out how to best, like, position the episodes and also the most, um, clicks from my existing audience, 'cause Jarvis Johnson! GOLD has and I would love to convert And because, like, I have the... [Ja] I'm like the YouTuber of the bunch, - and we have the YouTube podcast, like, I... - [Jo] Are we &quot;the bunch&quot;? if the podcast just has three that's gonna perform, And so, because of us and having we're always trying to make [Ja] And sometimes one of those or it will be, like, either just me or just me and the guest, and we're experimenting the YouTube feature, turned on, and we're trying to see And on the last episode, for example, uh, we had like a... Jarvis-and-Stanz version, and then a Jordan-and-Stanz version. [Ja] And I think the no offense to Stanz, 'cause it was more, um... [Ja] It was more, uh, like, normal-looking - [Jo] Yeah. [Jo] That is a common--I mean, - [Jo] People want reliability, etc. that didn't have me in it, &quot;This is the first...&quot; like, This is the first one where Jordan--&quot; [Ja] Like, &quot;Jordan in the thumbnail! Woo!&quot; - [Jo] &quot;He's back, baby!&quot; [Ja] And it's, uh... [Ja] And of course not performing &quot;as well,&quot; [Ja] But it's like this--I'm torn, because-- [Ja] And I did respond kind of with some of the people, &quot;I just find it weird that the guests--&quot; excuse me, &quot;the hosts of the [Ja] And then I went to and it's like Ludwig only 99% of the time. [Ja] And the reason is-- [Ja] The whole point of &quot;I wanna make my friends rich,&quot; you know? [Ja] And everybody gets the vibe. [Ja] But I think some people feel like uh, I'm cutting you out of the show - or something. [Ja] But I think what and what they'll never fully understand, and I'm not complaining, and just sort of talking [Jo] No, I like that [Ja] It's like, um, the... [Ja] Like, I want the so that everybody is able to get paid, 'cause we don't have a big... it's not like a... &quot;Oh, we overhired, and we had this big office and whatever.&quot; [Ja] We record at my place. [Ja] We just want the show so that everyone can get paid and we can pay immigration lawyers and we can pay our editors. [Jo] Yeah, the mission of this show [Ja] Yeah. So it's frustrating, because I understand when people are... like, feel weird about it. But then it also makes me feel like because I'm like, uh... 'cause the thumbnails are, like, &quot;Oh, yay, Jordan's in the thumbnail!&quot; And I'm like, I know that that's not true, - and I know it's just like-- And I know it's a sort of But it is also we're just and I spend a lot of time and trying to come up sustainably grow the show And it's not like we're trying to, not like we're trying to 10x growth, [Ja] We're just trying to keep [Ja] And, um, do that without, like, always having a big guest And everything's fine, and but it's just in the interest and also just wanting to put on it sometimes gets to me. [Ja] And I just figured but then we also have to do this - [Jo] (laughs) Oh, shit, we're live. [Ja] It's just like a thing frustrating for me. [Ja] But also, it will pass, and I have all the support and the team's been amazing. I do think a part of it is, um, that I'm like the [Jo] Like, I think there is maybe because you have a larger people might be like, &quot;We gotta... He's the underdog! [Jo] And it's nice enough, Honestly, I can see a who would maybe even have some pride in it or some just, &quot;I gotta I default to it being-- [Jo] Not that if I am, it is but trusting you and on what will or will [Jo] If I'm not in it... I'm like, &quot;OK, I guess we decided this [Ja] Truly, it's just And then we get the report after they've tested all the thumbnails. [Jo] If I felt like I wasn't, or experience of the show was then that would be the thing that was... - that I found hurtful. - [Ja] Oh, God. [Ja] Oh my God. I would rather expire. That would actually be very funny if we just edit in different [Jo] It's me, but [Ja] Yeah, or we just edit that didn't really happen. But no, I also wanna say I mean, I know the intentions are good. [Ja] I think everyone means well, and I don't even want any behavior to change from anyone. [Ja] I'm not asking for that, 'cause I don't control [Ja] You know, I can just not look, [Ja] And I don't think it affects the average listener, [Ja] They're just listening while they - do their art homework or whatever. - [Ja] But, um... to you and the team and everything for making this show [Jo] It sometimes just makes me emotional, so I'm gonna be [Jo] It is very weird the priority, and that it's such a-- [Jo] I feel guilty a lot of the time [Jo] I do feel like [Jo] And I get why I'm not. [Jo] There's, you know, and things that get in the way, whatever. [Jo] But there is, like... [Jo] I've never felt like I have [Jo] That's the reason I haven't - [Jo] This covers it for now. [Jo] But I do want this, like... [Jo] I'm so blissful with Sad Boyz. [Jo] It is such a mystical that sometimes when I spot &quot;Oh. This didn't... - It's OK. Guys, I'm all good.&quot; - [Ja] It's a little bit like--'cause... [Ja] It's not blissful for me, [Ja] Like, I'm more than [Ja] And I think what I really want is to provide that safety net, you know? [Ja] I think the takeaway &quot;Oh, it's a hyperspecific [Ja] You know, something's &quot;What's the reality vs. And then I can talk to people in my life. I can talk to people who care about me And also, like... Uh... and then trust that, rather than overindexing on, you know, something that's more representative of an insecurity than it is a reality. [Jo] Yeah. It's smoke Exactly, yeah. I think it's really cool that you're I also get a little frustrated with it, not because there's anything, like... [Jo] I'm not being wronged in any way, but I do get a little bothered by, like, &quot;I don't want... me getting Jarvis down.&quot; In an abstract way, obviously. But in a, &quot;I don't want For you to have an afternoon - with a bad time. There's a much smaller Um... the, uh... 'Cause it's also like... You can't control how other You can't, like... you can massage it. You can propagandize it You're not in control of that narrative. Something I talk about You have to control what you can control, and you know your truth, right? So one fun example of this, 'cause it is a little bit and it's a little bit me - [Jo] The misdeeding bastard returns. we did this little thing on It was like commentary YouTubers, uh, &quot;I spent a day with&quot; or whatever. [Ja] Um... [Ja] And it was me, [Ja] And in the Instagram &quot;I've seen this guy on my recommended. He's always mad--&quot; or &quot;He's always, like, just complains about things, and there's not any [Ja] And I was like, because I disagree, but I'm curious what - [Ja] And so-- - either. It doesn't seem-- &quot;I'll bite. What are you talking about?&quot; 'Cause I think even there was always nuance Even when I was talking about content I would try to have nuance, even if it was framed in a negative way, 'cause that was the packaging of YouTube. It was kinda like playing and I have to, you know, - 'cause that gave me a career, basically. [Jo] It doesn't mean there Exactly. My thought process You know, you come in a and then I'm like... gonna lull you to sleep - But, um... Kadabra, back and forth. But I asked them, and this &quot;Um, well... you... were talking about a And you said it was a bad thing. And she's doing something good, and you're just sitting at home And I was like, &quot;Oh, we just disagree.&quot; - We just disagree completely. Like, 'cause I don't think the person to clean a grave - with chemicals that are not meant for-- [Ja] Yeah, and also is, like... kind of doing, um... like, white saviorism to, &quot;Ooh, Rodolfo, - what a weird name,&quot; you know? - &quot;I wonder if he had friends.&quot; You know? Literally, it'll be like, &quot;Was she pretty? - &quot;Aw, she's dead.&quot; And then I also happen to know and that there's all these &quot;The beaches are so dirty in Puerto Rico!&quot; Like, and it's things that, OK, then I talk to my friends - so I think this person sucks.&quot; - Um... in a literally, like, [Ja] Yeah, sorry. &quot;I think - [Jo] Yeah, sure. and I think this person, doesn't fully know why, kinda like the girl who's [Ja] I think she means well, [Jo] I can absolutely see that &quot;Wow, she's working in Target for free?&quot; And then people go, And so, uh, I'm like, &quot;OK, I don't need to This person has what I perceive to be... - They've exhibited poor media literacy.&quot; And it's not my job to educate them. [Ja] Well, I mean, I tried, and I didn't meet them where they were at, and it's like I can just let that be, 'cause I have all these [Ja] Of course there will be and someone who feels [Ja] But then there's also &quot;Oh, no, that was an era. That was definitely an era [Ja] And I was like... &quot;OK, - what are YOU talking about?&quot; - [Ja] Yeah. [Ja] But I think... Telling someone they had Also, those people haven't seen my videos that are older than that, where it's like... you can-- [Jo] Less eras, [Ja] I don't think I've-- have been pretty standard, like my worldview Um, but I think that's interesting, that I just can't control that narrative and I just have to let that go. [Ja] That's also why I don't think it's which I didn't, but when stuff I'm sometimes bad about not looking or muting everything - [Ja] And, uh, it's progress. [Jo] I know comments... You have a--and this You have a habit of, uh... engaging with a comment - by the factor of it being a comment. - And I think it's very... I know that's been a point of... conflict for you for a long time, that that's something Because to give so much which now it sounds like your relationship with the comment, that's not an easy thing to do. Yeah, I think it's, uh... Ultimately, I probably... It's a little bit like my own inner critic things that are critical of me, because I am internally And I wanna make sure It's always like, &quot;Well, Am I wrong? Did I miss something?&quot; And when someone explains &quot;Oh, OK, then we are just, like, two ships passing. This is--&quot; Or the language being used severe than what the person intended. [Ja] Yeah. But I think over the years, I've definitely gotten better. Um, and also gotten better at not, like... just outright telling someone Um, I've never been Like, I definitely, um... responded to one of &quot;I would take myself out of these And I would love to get to a point where But I don't know if that's 'cause it's just the game I don't have any aspirations to... be as clickable a face. That's not like, uh--hey, you know... if I develop more of a platform, but I just have no, like... I'm already, uh, on New Game+ to some extent, It's already like, uh, way more than I ever Yeah, but it's not like charity to include Like it's, um... It's always... The principle problem that we run into, why there's ever an issue, is... making the thumbnail--we don't-- We're still trying to, like... for each thumbnail, it's a different to try and figure out how to Because we don't have... You know, we've been so we have a good core, but... we're still trying to And, um, so we have to, like... Like, we can't just do the like some people do, or we that doesn't care about the thumbnail. We're still playing that And part of playing [Ja] I had to take, uh, Lolo and Olay out of the Steve Harvey thumbnail, and... because it was just performing so poorly, and I knew it wasn't the content's fault. - [Jo] Sure. Or it's not even their fault. - [Jo] And I relate to this as a consumer. [Jo] I, more often than not, - [Ja] Exactly! Me too. And the thing is, like, I know that it doesn't matter, because, um... Excuse me. I know that it no one bounces off... bounces off the video. They But for whatever reason, the that it might not be what they want. And if someone has any doubt about whether or not it's gonna be the comfort And so I kind of just returned to comfort, 'cause it is just the that I've done for a couple years now. [Jo] We should say that pretty much or get along with - that would be bothered by that. [Jo] It's never the case that [Ja] I care 'cause I don't and I want it to be the most, um... the best for everybody, right? 'Cause if more people come through these great creators and friends of mine. And if I lead with them, maybe fewer people come through that door. But you know, I'm talking to &quot;Dude, I change the thumbnail - Like, &quot;Why are you even asking me?&quot; [Ja] Also, Olay's great. - when &quot;Meet the Grahams&quot; dropped. - [Jo] Christmas. to each other, like, [Ja] It was a great time. [Ja] But yeah, long-winded. [Ja] Um, but strong-winded, dude. [Jo] Yeah, you've been farting. - [Ja] Oh. You heard that? - Yeah, blew my hair back. [Jo] No, I like us having chats like this, 'cause it also makes me, like... I'm always, I guess, proudest of - stuff like that. [Jo] Which, combined with, like, you know, - also getting a nice thumbo in, and... I'm always gonna be a bunch of people's favorite episode - which is like the two and a half hour, us dicking around having a good time, And then the, uh-- And then also men are There's like everything there. - Was that here? What's crazy about that one-- No one cares. But, um, what was funny about that one That was the thing, where I think And the original thumbnail for it was 100% not gonna perform as well. So it sometimes feels like - There is a correct answer, you know? And that's not always the case, like not everything has or has the same But, uh... You know, there's so many what we do that... unfortunately, we have to and the marketing and And also thinking about the audience that like... currently, we reach - and when we started this podcast-- Cooties! When we started this podcast, the whole premise be able to talk about our feelings not lead by example, 'cause that sounds add an example to a &quot;Hey, you can have that involve goofing and also Obviously, it... It rules that our demographic includes - so many women and nonbinary people. Which is, like... - never the case. (laughs) [Jo] No one has that. It's really cool. [Jo] And I would love to... you know, um... [Jo] I love getting the feedback of, uh, &quot;This is a type of guy I don't see a lot, and then in the flipside, I also love seeing, &quot;I was self-conscious about - [Jo] It's just different. if there's any goal that I have, it's simply to add an addition to, you know, the younger boy, young man, who... is kind of figuring out their way. And we can share our experiences that might be valuable to that person. And if we're not reaching that person, it's not like we have Acquire the Boy. [Jo] Yeah, we're not changing the content. No, but it's more like packaging and marketing. What small changes can we make? 'Cause I made a video about about the men rating women thing, and I got so many DMs from young men when I was vulnerable about I was like, &quot;Man, like... there is something...&quot; I feel like there's something of value that's not reaching some and then I just wanna figure out We don't wanna trade anyone. It's like we want a larger bowl [Ja] Yeah, and I think I'm sure that... Because we spend a lot of time you know that there are who are being targeted predatorialy by kinda snake-oil salesmen and the like. So it's like, all we're saying is, OK, how do we reach those people without turning them off from, uh... Like, without compromising on anything? I think there's the-- Jack Conte has this talk It's called &quot;Adjust Your Packaging.&quot; It's maybe eight, six And it's literally about, as an artist... you have the stuff that and then the stuff outside of the box and that you can adjust. And packaging, for example, If somebody told me tomorrow, and that will appeal to and also 16-year-old boys in Vancouver that will become Austin, - [Jo] Oh, yuck. [Ja] &quot;That's a win for everybody.&quot; [Jo] &quot;Not my favorite color, [Ja] I don't care, That's not a thing I care about. And so I think that's, like, from your point about the content, I never want the content to change unless it's something that and from the team and stuff. But there is... considerations being made of, like... I think it's just a responsibility when you're putting something &quot;Who does this help? Who is this for? What is this for? Including work, like, prior to... public publishing Working at Patreon not to besmirch any other company, but it felt like a more because the people that would as consumers and creators, Exactly, 'cause I wouldn't if I didn't grow up watching and learn about Patreon and be like, Oh, Julia Nunes is on Actually, I do think making, like... I do envision me at, like... 17, 18, as the Sad Boyz listener. - Even though it's not the specific demo, it is the show-- The show's quality is That's kinda where I'm at, too. [Jo] Which I guess is the case Like, whatever your aspiration is, for what your inspirations were. But sometimes I think maybe we're not giving ourselves enough credit-- Who knows? Be the judge. Won't read 'em! Um... Unless they're nice. Uh, but no, like... Some people find a market, and it's like, &quot;Oh, people in Mexico like my songs, so I'm gonna start singing in Spanish and kinda pivot to that market.&quot; [Ja] Even though that's not-- [Ja] Because maybe what I want-- [Ja] &quot;Because I want to be able and this is the fastest way - [Jo] And there's no planning for that. but I think we're in a privileged position to be kind of in charge of and that's a very fortunate and we're very lucky to have it. - We're very grateful to have it. Listeners and consumers. [Jo] You little piggies. [Ja] I have a great segue off of this, but I wanna first [Jo] Uh, I am... all right. [Jo] I'm in one of those periods [Jo] And I'm trying to or what has happened in between episodes. [Jo] Maybe just--I'm... [Jo] I officially, I'm very [Jo] I'm very excited about that. Uh... [Ja] I gotta get you playing Magic. [Jo] Yeah, I gotta get on that. I... think... [Jo] I really need to get [Jo] Because it's almost like where I've had such chronically that now... [Jo] I'm accustomed to a [Jo] And when I have--I even if my sleep sucked. [Jo] It makes a day feel [Jo] I can have half the brainpower, but if I hop on my laptop at 9 a.m. I can get triple as much done. - [Jo] It's just... I don't know. [Jo] I'm honestly a little [Jo] I'm like, &quot;Well, it's the easier one, - so I guess everyone could say that.&quot; [Ja] So, in fairness, - and then I... grew up, dude. [Ja] No, I... [Ja] Something shifted. I started and it does take time to build that habit. And then that became more Right now, I'm in the worst of all worlds, where I'm going to sleep at the and then I'm still sleeping in, so I need to figure out But my doctor's still on maternity leave. That's the issue, [Jo] I'm very thankful for and diagnoses that [Jo] I'm, like... I consider medical care and utility but, uh, and I'm in a position to do that, but also just very lucky for success by-- [Jo] Turns out I just [Jo] I was not responsible for making and they've put me [Jo] Shoutouts to Special K. - [Jo] Uh... [Jo] Yeah, thanks to ketamine. I meant &quot;psychology.&quot; [Jo] I don't feel like I've really even taken many And I think a lot of the time, Uh, eight hours ahead of the US as well, so talking to anyone I think I broke into a new limit of bad, where now my average is usually about three doesn't really matter when I go to sleep; And then one day a week, And that is such a bad loop - for triggering hypomania. And I'm too fatigued for getting hyperfocused on making But with hanging out with people more-- I'm also much better when, um... uh, Katie's at mine, or vice-versa, because she's... You know, neither of us but there is an acknowledgment of, - Right. wants to stay up right now?&quot; But I think habitually, I've got this... I'm very happy with that really helps me get to sleep and But I have an alarm I never take it at 11:00 well, not drowsy, but it There's a weird part of &quot;I don't wanna get slowed down. You're like, &quot;I need to go fast.&quot; - [Jo] And I don't wanna game out. [Jo] It's like--and then I sit playing a roguelike, so the progress I'm not absorbing anything, unless [Ja] Are you playing the - [Jo] I'm saving it. [Jo] I was so late to [Jo] It hit at, uh... [Jo] When did I play? which, as you know, but playing it genuinely helped me a lot. - [Jo] So I'm waiting for tragedy. [Jo] Uh, but the... I still have a bunch of that I just, uh, - Or were bad habits. Like, &quot;I'm gonna have a... I'm gonna have some drinks That's my evening. And the truth is work on some video ideas I have. Resolve that comfortably around 10:00 p.m. If it's just a font of Pop my little pill, 11:00 p.m. Maybe I made a little music instead. Maybe I just did something that - Maybe I just tidied or cleaned. - And then love my pillow. Instead of going to bed like a task. And I really... I always wake up for Sad Boyz. Thankfully that's enough and I think that's That's what I liked about What I've never been is, like, properly medicated and, um, on the path... I now am these things, but properly medicated and on the path to improving quality of - [Ja] Yeah. not some weird job or lifestyle. - [Ja] Right. San Francisco, moved to LA... the week after I got diagnosed. It was like, I'm so curious at that time in his current setup. No regret. Like, it worked out. It's not - or big conflict or something. I do... It's almost like camouflage. Like, I'm happy with my meds. Like, the things that are improving, things that I have been very just continuously reduced I... I see sleep as such and I feel so far from Also, I almost certainly have - another thing I have to figure out. I was taking my meds - &quot;There's too many of these.&quot; [Ja] Yeah. Well, you take medication for, uh, ugly-- - For, um, being ugly. - [Jo] But it doesn't work. - [Ja] But I keep taking it. and it makes you ugly, maybe. [Ja] No. No, 'cause then [Jo] That's a really good point. - [Ja] &quot;Wait, these are my ugly pills.&quot; [Jo] Every time I've seen Eddy recently, like every single time, we're just chatting, I don't know, like, being somewhere else and I just go, &quot;You were - [Ja] Yeah. - [Jo] &quot;You're the wax.&quot; - [Ja] &quot;No, wait. No, but you're in it...&quot; - [Ja] &quot;It's like a circus, kind of.&quot; [Ja] &quot;It's like a art installation, - and they say, 'Look at Mr. Ugly.'&quot; - [Ja] &quot;You live there.&quot; - [Ja] &quot;Ooh, what is it?&quot; - [Ja] &quot;You suck.&quot; [Ja] I have a great segue. [Ja] Let me grab my phone. [Jo] Have we talked about how died by falling off a cliff? [Ja] I don't know if we have, - [Jo] Legend. [Ja] OK, so the thing I wrote down is, &quot;Why are we putting - [Ja] Isn't that insane? It makes me mad, because it feels like... they just want to fill me up. And I'm You put eggs and bacon Do you think that in hashbrown form, OK. The hashbrown form, I'm of two minds. If we're at a fancy place... If we're at like a food truck, If you put--wait, you said hashbrowns. Which can mean a couple of things. The first thing I imagined uh, cylindric--not cylindrical. - [STAZ] Like a McDonald's hashbrown? - [Jo] A giant nugget. - [Jo] I'm thinking of the lattice. - The lattice would be the move, actually. Um, but today I was eating an And I just bite into... a potato that, like, wasn't the - [Jo] Unacceptable. It was almost like a pickle shape. - [STAZ] Are you sure it was a potato? - Did I say potato? No. No, it was like there were And I was like, And I just forked it out, And I'm sorry if you love potatoes. I like potatoes too. But... You gotta season them Or they've gotta be the right softness, - the right consistency. Um... and I don't think 'Cause, look. Eggs have You're gonna chomp But then if the resistance and the potato's a little chalky... [STAZ] What are your ingredients? [STAZ] For a breakfast burrito? Eggs. - [Ja] If I'm being completely honest... 'Cause I am a dirty meat-eater. Anastasia, I know you're a vegetarian. - Uh, which is cool. And not lame. Dude who am I? &quot;Om-nom-nom, salad.&quot; [Ja] Egg, bacon, - maybe some avocado slices. [Ja] Maybe a little pico. - [Ja] Um, de gallo. Not Pico Boulevard. - [Ja] Or Pico Union. [Jo] Maybe I'm going to Pico Union - to get it from the food truck. Yeah, but really... A burrito in its entirety And I've completely just - [Jo] Yes. [Ja] OK. Self-described. - [STAZ] But I do think it is because-- [Jo] We can be the burrito bastards, We give you the race card. [STAZ] No, but I feel like, a burrito is better, because... - [Ja] Than a taco? because there's something [STAZ] People just don't... [STAZ] The things that go are little bits and bobs, - strips of meat or something. - [Ja] Or Soyrizo. [Ja] Every veggie burrito [STAZ] You know what? from HomeState. - [Ja] HomeState! [STAZ] They make great [STAZ] And they're perfect. [Ja] And their potatoes, they're little cubey guys, than a giant cylindrical-- - inside of my burrito. [STAZ] For a burrito, a huge problem always is, um, proportions. Like, you need - throughout the whole cylinder. [Ja] &quot;Throughout the whole cylinder,&quot; [Jo] It's sort of a DEI-type [STAZ] That DEI is ruining burritos? We're forced to put these [Ja] It sounded like &quot;potatoes&quot; Well, I did say something else. But then I'm like, &quot;Why would you I don't know. And then I'm in trouble. - [Ja] Yeah. Though I will say I've recently Now, this isn't productive. [Ja] And one day I hope it will be. [Ja] Anastasia and I - [STAZ] We did. It's true. [Ja] I've been going back, and I've been getting a little coffee, and been getting two breakfast tacos. [Ja] And the breakfast tacos, black beans. [Ja] Some whole, some spread. Just a tad. - [Ja] Just a tad. [Ja] A little cheese. [Ja] A little pico. [Ja] Two... soft-boiled eggs... [Ja] Not two full soft-boiled eggs. - [STAZ] Like slices. a soft-boiled egg has been quartered, like top-down quartered, - so it's like a slice, like imagine-- - A spear, yeah. A spear of-- Yeah, like as if it looks like Yes. Yeah. So, dense enough Yes, but still small enough, Very few ingredients in this. [Ja] That's it, actually. - [Jo] No meat? - [Jo] Was there meat? - [Ja] It's a veggie... - [Ja] Anastasia-safe. something you relate to, You're afraid. You don't eat meat - [STAZ] I'm scared of cows. I've seen you bite Like the first - [Ja] Will Forte bit a head of lettuce. [Jo] But yyyyyyy... I struggle with the taco. - [Ja] Oh... If it's a breakfast taco. [Jo] If there's no meat protein in it, Oh, but the egg has protein. Oh, I suppose, uh, - but meat or something. - [Jo] Even a Impossible meat. [Jo] The bite that I'm having, it's like having vegetarian-only curry, where texturally I'm missing - that's some of the best curry. With a burrito, I don't know I'm having a bite. I like the bite. I'm not lost in, like, &quot;Where's the pig?&quot; [STAZ] My all-time favorite the vegetarian Mission [STAZ] It's a very [STAZ] Beans, rice, lettuce, cheese. [STAZ] Uh, avocado and pico de gallo. [STAZ] A lot of people hate because they're like, &quot;Why are you - I just want meat and beans and cheese.&quot; [STAZ] But it's such a specific burrito that I truly lived on when Jarvis and I both lived - [STAZ] Um, I would buy-- - [Jo] What's the address? [STAZ] It's some rich jerk. [Jo] Oh. Dox him. [STAZ] But, uh, I would buy one burrito pretty much every day, and eat half of it for lunch Never been able to do that. I'm lost. I'm two-thirds deep, like, [Ja] &quot;What, am I gonna put this away?&quot; [Ja] A burrito-sized gulp - [Jo] It takes three weeks. - like $7.50 to $8. [STAZ] Now they're much more expensive. - spending like $8 for two meals? [STAZ] And I'm riding my bike everywhere. [STAZ] I was just not spending any money. [STAZ] I didn't have any money. San [Jo] Yeah, maybe for you. [STAZ] Yeah. Yes. That's what I'm saying. - [STAZ] I was a broke-ass. - [Ja] No, you're describing-- [Jo] Yeah, we agree. - [Ja] Also, you were at the ugly museum. - [Ja] Which you own. [STAZ] I live there, but I was visiting. - [STAZ] Also. - [Ja] No, 'cause you're too pretty. [Ja] You have to be ugly to get in, - at the ugly museum. - Is who is there. Yes. Yeah. [JACOB] Curious that you [Jo] I don't know anything. - [Ja] He saw a video essay about it. What I said was, &quot;I don't even And then everything after that - I was joking. Is this real? You actually go to the Also, Jacob owned it, and is the - Wait, so that makes three of us. [Ja] Oh, three different museums. [Ja] They're like that, uh-- [Ja] That, um...

[STAZ] I did work at-- [Ja] And so you can make that museum joke. [Jo] True. You have [Ja] That's like earlier like a Caesar cipher had been run on it, I don't think anyone in this room - but through context clues. But some of my nerds out there - [STAZ] Yeah. big muscles and not being - and I don't know what that is. but sometimes I out myself Also with shit like &quot;I was playing - &quot;Sometimes I accidentally out myself.&quot; but I didn't 'cause I was I was knee-deep in my - &quot;Mom, leave! I'm tapping!&quot; [STAZ] Um, should we talk about [Ja] Yes, we should. - [Jo] Yeah. &quot;Should we...&quot; [Jo] We should write about your museum. - [JACOB] I make these people up. easier to believe [STAZ] Earlier, you said and I was thinking, - [Jo] Summon. Show me boy. - [Jo] Serf! [Jo] Um, can I... - [Ja] Oh, you have to pee. (cartoon running sound effect) [Ja] So, uh, Jacob, you've prepared a boy.

[Ja] Yeah. If you wanna multiply, uh, ones with a bunch of zeroes, [Jo] Or you could get a life! I'm really sorry, man. I have to do a shift - A shift? You don't own it, though. I work there part time, like right now. Like right now, I'm the only - [Jo] Dude, you gotta go! [JACOB] I think it's time to - [Ja] Fuck. - [Jo] You've got too many side gigs. - All right, I'm locked in. [JACOB] But yeah, I would say - [Ja] Oh, OK. [JACOB] And so we're [JACOB] Um, this one is fun. [JACOB] These are like, uh-- [JACOB] The concept that &quot;This guy's written by a woman,&quot; which is something that - [Ja] Exhibits any amount of sensitivity? - [Jo] Is not scary. [Ja] &quot;He's written by a woman. [Jo] An Uber driver not &quot;This Uber driver's really progressive.&quot; [STAZ] A guy asks [STAZ] &quot;(gasps) Oh my God, [Jo] &quot;Is this...

[Ja] Yeah. You have to have it It'd be really funny - [Ja] He doesn't have to keep-- - [Jo] Oh. [Ja] It looks like he just [Jo] (laughing) Yeah, a stealth takedown. [Ja] And she just collapses on the ground. - [STAZ] &quot;Quiet, quiet, quiet.&quot; [Ja] Now he's got her in submission. [Ja] He kinda looks like Wolverine.

Where Frieza [Ja] Yeah. &quot;Come clo--come closer.&quot; - [Ja] &quot;Come closer, monkey!&quot; [Ja] &quot;The feeling is love, and I've not even reached my final form.&quot; [Jo] &quot;I've got a bunch of girlfriends.&quot; - [Jo] Is he gonna jump out the window? - [Jo] OK. - (Jordan laughs) - [Jo] &quot;I hate it!&quot; how you feel... and I hope 'Cause if she doesn't know and you're uh, scary energy, I think. Yeah, not quite worthy of By the way, the determining &quot;I keep choosing [her and I'm thinking about her all the time.&quot; Like, depending on what you... - [Jo] How literal is that? where they were, like, lightly dating somebody and then they immediately I'm thinking about you all the time.&quot; I need to get out of this.&quot; [Jo] &quot;I'm outside right now. [STAZ] I have to say, who could, if I chose to, write a man... [Ja] I wanna know what love is! (Staz laughing) - [Ja] That was me genuinely asking. [STAZ] I feel like there is a weird belief that women want this intensity, and that's not true. Like, this is scary. [Jo] SHUT UP, DUDE. - [Jo] This is for the boys, OK? [Jo] Um, I'm in love, [Jo] &quot;Ahhh!&quot; [Jo] What if he killed him? [STAZ] If I was dating someone-- [STAZ] Like, I want someone and be like, &quot;OK, what are Before you're in love with me, maybe we say, &quot;Hey, I like you. Hey, let's hang out more.&quot; I do feel as though, like, a lot of &quot;written by X--&quot; I wonder if this [Jo] It's an overused term, the male gaze is like... [Jo] Just the fact that it feels performative in a way that is a little too self-conscious about appearing feminine [Jo] It's not, &quot;I'm feeling Instead, it's, &quot;I'm a alpha tiger. I can't stop thinking I'm obsessed with her. I feel like he's the - [STAZ] Yeah. Oof. I feel like that's... a man writing for a woman. - [STAZ] Yeah. Do you have a piece of media that - resonates with you that is--? who thinks he's writing [STAZ] OK, so I... OK. [STAZ] I'm gonna say something - [STAZ] But... it's fine. [STAZ] I do read romances, uh, - on occasion. (laughs) [STAZ] They're really popular right now, so a lot of friends have [STAZ] When I was younger, [STAZ] And as I've gotten older and as these have gotten I'm like, &quot;OK, I'm gonna--&quot; &quot;I'm gonna read these romances.&quot; [STAZ] And some of them, &quot;Ooh, I don't wanna read this,&quot; because it is written by a woman, and the main male character &quot;You're mine!&quot; or something. [STAZ] All of this goes back to, where it's like, whoever was making rom-coms in the '80s. Yeah, there's only so original you can be when the format of your story [STAZ] Yeah, and there's huge and this guy, Garett whatever his name is, he's just, um... mimicking those things, &quot;I wanna scream it from a mountain - [Jo] Don't. - don't want this. [Jo] &quot;I'm so in love - [Jo] I'm like, &quot;Oh, no!&quot; [Ja] So this next one's which makes me [Ja] In another life! [Ja] What's his normal voice sound like? - [Ja] I just don't believe-- [Ja] (gravelly) &quot;You look beautiful.&quot; - It's like he's trying to sound cool. &quot;Hey. You look beautiful.&quot; [STAZ] &quot;This is what - [Ja] &quot;Wow.&quot; [Ja] &quot;I just got my powers.&quot; - [Jo] &quot;I'm releasing my energy blast.&quot; [Ja] &quot;I just learned what love is.&quot; - [Jo] &quot;I want you to show me.&quot; [Jo] &quot;I broke into your house, [Ja] &quot;Couldn't control myself.&quot; [Jo] &quot;I stole the radio out of your car [Ja] &quot;And here it is.&quot; [Ja] That's just a compliment. [Ja] Oh. - [Jo] Is... gonna--oh, no. [Jo] Is there something any more romantic I mean, look, I like eye contact, - but it's just the delivery of it. Like, looking at you, - and she's like, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; Eye contact with body turned away. [Ja] &quot;I can't stop looking at you.&quot; It's like there's ways-- If you said anything with that, - (threateningly) &quot;I... love you.&quot; [Ja] If you said your it would sound really fucked up. - [STAZ] &quot;'Til death do us part.&quot; [Jo] &quot;Will you part?&quot; (fwing!) - [Jo] Snikt! [Jo] (laughing) Yeah, dude. [Ja] Yeah. Except for - [Jo] Yeah. Snikt. [Jo] I just gotta say, I do think [Jo] There are two very separate like, sexual dynamics and this, in that-- [Jo] We watched that clip of the girl [Jo] It's self-aware. It's just [Jo] 'Cause gender performance media, porn, etc., is very influential on [Jo] But that is a little like... how wearing a white dress for a wedding has some pretty uncomfortable implications [Jo] But... if everyone's and no one cares, [STAZ] Well, and it's like... &quot;This is fantasy, and that's great, and I know that it's and that's not what I want in reality, but it is what I want in fantasy.&quot; [STAZ] Great. I'm all on board. [Jo] I think the framing of - [Jo] I don't know, this is-- - and I want your revenge! I want your love! [Jo] Is that true? [Jo] Jesus. [Jo] (laughs) Oh! [Ja] OK, so she's with someone else, - [Jo] But that's romance. [Ja] I just feel like there's [Ja] I'm not saying you if someone's with someone else, but... [STAZ] And just take no for an answer, - [Ja] Yeah. [Jo] &quot;Let me wrestle you. What's wrong?&quot; - [Ja] Putting her... - that is extremely inappropriate. - [Jo] Yeah. &quot;What's wrong?&quot; - [Jo] &quot;It's over.&quot; [Ja] &quot;Frieza!&quot; Um, OK. [Ja] You're about to get more selfish? [Ja] She was like, [Jo] &quot;Please. I'm not looking that way.&quot; [Ja] &quot;I love you.&quot; [Jo] Such a good point. [Ja] You can't? But you just were. - [Jo] &quot;I can't be selfish.&quot; [Jo] &quot;What do you want me to say?&quot; [Jo] &quot;Because I love you, - I have to be selfless and harass you.&quot; You have to quit your job [Ja] There's so many because you want to be with the person. [Jo] Yeah. That is like, &quot;I want the partner you're with right now to feel bad and be compromised, - because I wanna be with you.&quot; You can call me selfish! But all I want is your love! All right. - [Ja] What? [Ja] Why is he walking around like that? [Jo] She has to say it back, - &quot;You know I love you, right?&quot; [Jo] &quot;I'm blocking all the - [Jo] Maybe it's four different guys. [Ja] It's cutting to different [JACOB] Yeah, no, [Jo] Maybe she's ugly, dude. [Ja] OK, hold on. [STAZ] Maybe she's [Jo] Which you made, and you're from that. - [Ja] You would know a lot about that. [Ja] Wait, she said--wait, hold on. [Ja] &quot;You know I love you, right?&quot; [Jo] Uncompromisingly. Scarily. [Ja] &quot;Just not the way that I love you.&quot; - [Jo] Yeah. (laughs) Yeah. Please do. &quot;And not the way no one &quot;And you know I love you, because love is not equal.&quot; - [Jo] She's walking away. a wolf loves a rabbit he's about to eat.&quot; &quot;I love you like a serial killer that I am would kill you with a gun.&quot; [JACOB] So, I wanna get to [Ja] OK. Here, I'm leaning back. - [Ja] Let me know if I'm still in frame. [Jo] We're locking in, but leaning back. [Jo] For the audio listeners, leaning against his wheel. - [Ja] This is why we-- Yeah, this is just telling me that his employer needs to - [Jo] Yeah. He's sleeping in his car.

Wait, so that cut, was going to the other side of his body to show the action shot - [Ja] Yeah, he's taking off his jacket.

[Jo] That's what I mean. I know it's literally &quot;written by presented as &quot;This is the ideal No, this is what you want in a movie. - [STAZ] Yeah. when you have to kill Russians.
