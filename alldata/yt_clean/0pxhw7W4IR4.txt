- I remember walking away from set and hearing these big manly grips singing &quot;Popular&quot; to each other. So, that's what happens when you get into the (uptempo piano music) No, mom, you're in the shot. (uptempo piano music resumes) - [Interviewer] So Jon, you've You've worked on the &quot;Step Up&quot; franchise, &quot;GI Joe Retaliation,&quot; &quot;Now You See Me 2.&quot; You've worked with Justin Bieber. - Yes. &quot;Crazy Rich Asians,&quot; &quot;In The Looking back, does it feel surreal? - Yeah, it all feels surreal. I've only been waiting I saw &quot;Wicked&quot; when, when it was at the Curran Kristin and Idina were Never thought I would ever get the chance to direct the movie version of that, but 20 something years later - [Interviewer] What tips to find the right Elphaba and Galinda? - Cynthia, of course, I knew but the magnitude at which she did, when she sang in a room smaller than this, half the size of this room, you can feel her voice in your body. And defying gravity And you can call me I remember this one time we as Cynthia starts to sing, 'cause all these birds have Then they would stop But every time she would start singing, they would sing again. That was amazing. It was like they understood the magic that was happening in the space. For Galinda specifically, Ariana came in, and she had maybe a higher because she had such a public persona, and I really didn't want it to overshadow this role of Galinda. I wanted to find Galinda. She had to audition, And she came in the first time, and she looked like Ariana Grande. And we thought, hey, what if you came back and just didn't have any of your makeup? I did not know how that would go over. Not even a question. She came in and did that, and I saw her in a totally new light that I'd never seen her in. - [Interviewer] I know you because of your work in musicals. - I grew up watching musicals. Every weekend when I was growing up, my mom would take us to whether it was ballet season, opera season, or musical season. When I was in college and I they just naturally had and my last one was a straight up musical. Steven Spielberg saw it. He called me into his office, He loves musicals. So we got to talk all about and that has stuck with me my whole life. - [Interviewer] I heard that meeting led to one of your first times on a movie set. - He invited me to his set, so I got to sit next to and I got to watch him when something wasn't working And watching that kind of leadership with that kind of kindness, it was really a high to say, oh, you don't as a director to get what you want. So I've always tried to achieve that instead of yelling or forcing my vision or something like that, so I was very lucky to watch - [Interviewer] Did Steven - He did say, &quot;Pick the &quot;and make sure it's the I took it as pick the perfect because okay, if you pick you're not gonna have a career. But the first movie, after years and years of trying that was presented to me was straight to DVD movie. Because I had been discovered I told my team, I said, &quot;Oh, &quot;I don't.' And then I told my mom, and my mom said to me, &quot;When Made that movie, and eventually, it went straight theatrical. And that movie turned out to - [Interviewer] Rumor to a dance off with Miley Cyrus. - The biggest dance Our lead actor, Adam Sevani, he got a call from Miley Cyrus, and Miley left him a message and said, &quot;Oh, I loved you in the movie.&quot; So we got all our &quot;Step Up&quot; dancers, and we challenged Miley to a dance off. This was like digital &quot;West And she responded with a video she started adding big stars, like Ryan Seacrest and Channing Tatum, which was sort of a slap in 'cause they were the We had our sort of iconic YouTube four or five months during that time. It was pretty amazing. - [Interviewer] What was it like being a young director on these sets? - It was hard to work with 'cause I always felt One thing that when I worked on the first day, he &quot;Hey Jon, come here, come here.&quot; And he brought me close and he said, &quot;You know you look like my cousin. &quot;And how cool is that, &quot;that someone like you and &quot;can be the director and He's like, &quot;Let's go kill it.&quot; He just gave that little cookie to me, and I knew he had my back It took me about five or six oh, I think I know the and it was after that that I said, &quot;Okay, if you know the ins and outs, &quot;then what do you actually have to say?&quot; And that's when I decided that only I could make. - [Interviewer] And that movie was. - &quot;Crazy Rich Asians,&quot; confronting the thing that I was most scared which is my cultural identity crisis. - [Interviewer] What did with Constance Wu on &quot;Crazy Rich Asians&quot;? - That these scenes weren't just silly romantic comedy scenes. These were real truths, real wounds in her that she In &quot;Crazy Rich Asians,&quot; there's this one line that that is like, devastating, And on paper, you're like, is that enough to have our whole movie hinge on this one line? And when we shot it that day, Michelle Yeoh puts her on the staircase and backs her up into the stairs. Constance gets put down and she looks up, and and I swear her eyes - You will never be enough. - And Constance immediately Like, she cannot, she's so much so that we couldn't that she's like, &quot;I can only &quot;This is just too hard.&quot; And I think everyone on set felt that. So Michelle Yeoh saying those and I think audiences felt that too. - [Interviewer] And your mom - (laughs) It was at the top of the hotel where we shot the big ending We were shooting there at and my mom happened to be in town. Next thing I know, I and Michelle and my mom have giant bottles of First of all, you don't drink on set. Second of all, it's my She had to be in the scene, &quot;Like, you do not get my actor And then, they become Since then, she's come to My mom has traveled to LA so, ah, what can you do? Don't bring your mom on set. - [Interviewer] Let's talk What were some of your fears tackling Lin-Manuel Miranda's work? - I mean, I was scared outta my wits. I actually hadn't seen but I couldn't tell him that yet. I couldn't get tickets, and I didn't want to ask him for tickets. So I had to pretend even though I hadn't seen it. So later, after we were I did get the chance to I couldn't reveal to him how excited I was and I just saw it, so I had to ask him about the making of that Sorry, Lin, but I did see it. - [Interviewer] You've about some mistakes - I mean, I make mistakes every day, and we all have blind spots, and so we're all constantly learning about who we are and our craft and the power that we have with our voice. I think the hardest thing and really impact my whole oh, you're the director, everything you say needs to come true. And the reality is no, that you can't. A movie is made by hundreds and hundreds of hands and eyes and ears, and actually the best version that no individual person - [Interviewer] Do you who had just graduated from - No, I actually don't think I think that guy, even was really scared, was really scared to be accepted. I felt like I needed And I think he would be despite the stops and the starts, and despite people &quot;Oh, you don't belong here,&quot; or, &quot;There's no one like you here.&quot; I think he'd be proud (uptempo piano music)
