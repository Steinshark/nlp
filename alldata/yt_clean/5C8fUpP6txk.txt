You are more likely to choke and die eating crash. I guess that explains why airline food sucks! Plane pasta! To improve your safety! But a lot of this "flight safety" stuff Like "Bring your seat to an upright position has dimmed the cabin lights in preparation These are indeed safety precautions, but I ... or is it? Sorry we have a new editor! But seriously, have you ever wondered why but they are in cars? According to the FAA, mandating the use of the fatality rate of infants, but the reason, Lights ... off! It takes a good few seconds before you can in sudden darkness. During an airplane emergency evacuation, those becoming a survivor ... and becoming statistics, of take off and landing, so your eyes have when it's dark outside. Opening the cabin window shades during daylight to adjust to outdoor light so when you get your eyes are already acclimatized. The biggest cause of airplane crashes is pilot flight attendants! That said, more than 50% of fatal aviation when the aircraft is "low and slow". Not only things like bird strikes naturally the crew has less time to respond to an emergency of the Telluride Regional Airport in Colorado, The runway ends with a 1000-ft drop to San That's why there is an engineered materials runway, so in case of a run-over, the aircraft Guess how many fatalities occurred between passenger airlines in the United States. The answer is 2, and that's 2 too many. But this goes to show how safe it is to fly Of course, this figure excludes fatalities and the biggest category of them all, general Think of general aviation as all &quot;private took 4,328 lives in that same 11-year timeframe. Aviation safety has been consistently improving improvements are directly tied to the research continues to do with help from NASA, US Air For example, in April of 1964, the FAA crash-tested the post-crash causes of fatalities. The test was designed to break the landing into a hill. A few months later, in September, another L-1649 transport airplane. The post-crash survivability data that was many more tests, is how several aviation regulatory For example, all passengers and crew of an able to evacuate in 90 seconds or less, and Otherwise the aviation authorities won't approve that model. But how did the FAA come up with 90 seconds, It has to do ... with fire! There are two types of post-crash fires, one that some may not have heard of. First is the &quot;fireball&quot;. That's when fuel is released during a crash, ignites and then continues burning as the The second type is when flashover happens. As fire continues to burn inside an enclosed airplane, smoke starts to accumulate under heat. It doesn't take long at all until each and thermal radiation, like carpets and seat cushions, time, they simultaneously ignite. In case of a plane crash and the subsequent long enough to evacuate everyone, before flashover Even with the mandated use of self-extinguishing and seat cushions, in case of a fire, the 2-3 minutes. This is why the evacuation time was initially and analysis led the FAA to drop it down to But why only use half of the exit doors during That's because in case of a substantial on that side may not be safe to use. Today, evacuation tests for new airframes So there should be no surprise that when it the FAA's efforts have been focused on preventing on improving evacuation procedures. In 1984, the FAA and NASA conducted the Controlled B-720. The airplane was fully fueled with an anti-misting The test may have failed, since the airplane But since a number of anthropomorphic dummies on the forces that passengers are exposed This test also clearly shows that it's never someone! But notice how the seats are all upright! That's less for your safety, and more for A reclined seat could slow down or even prevent Think of someone who is older, or bigger, over the past decade or so. Every second counts in an evacuation, and your belongings with you, because stopping will take up precious time in case of an emergency Unfortunately, some people still don't take After incidents in which children were injured authorities in other countries recommended on flights. But this was never made mandatory, like it The FAA's rationale was that if the use of parents would have been forced to purchase child, as opposed to just holding them in The additional cost of purchasing a seat for factor in the parents' choice of transportation, Since mandatory child restraint systems would this could have subsequently increased the 2, given the substantially higher fatality The moral of the story is, listen to what your own safety. Just sit back, drink your juice, watch a movie don't act like a little biiiiiiiiiiiiiiii*ch!
