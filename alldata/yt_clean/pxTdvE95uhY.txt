[Becker] Thank you for joining us. I'm John Becker. A modern-day signature series here We look at old murders, cold cases, where investigators need help delivering During the next half hour, we revisit several of those stories. Investigators hope something you see could help them solve these mysterious murders. We begin with a story of a murder for some 30 years after it happened. October 20 1992, a wooded area of Knoxville turned It was a case many investigators thought would lead to a clear and final conclusion. Leslie Ackerson explains why, to this day, it remains unsolved. [Randy] Stand up, foreman. [Leslie] There was evidence, even a confession. [Randy] Stand up and look at him and say, &quot;You are guilty of every charge!&quot; [Leslie] But Knoxville's first serial [North] It's an unfinished case. It's an unresolved question. [Leslie] It was October 1992, when these woods off Cahaba Investigators later identified Patricia Rose Anderson, Patricia Johnson, They'd been raped, bound, and strangled. Some had a history of prostitution. That would help lead investigators known to local prostitutes as &quot;the Zoo Man.&quot; [David] He worked with his and his job was cleaning up after the elephants. [Leslie] At his home, authorities [David] He took mementos, earrings, rings, money. [Leslie] Chief David Davenport and would later sit down with Huskey, making a shocking discovery. [David] First time I talked to him, he was Tom. And we left the room to get some paperwork, and we come back and he was Kyle. And from Kyle, he progressed to He had the voice down pretty good. He could have been an actor. [Leslie] One of Huskey's personalities, [David] I thought it was all an act. I think the whole system got debunked. [Randy] I never had any doubt. [Leslie] Former District Attorney [Randy] It was the first time, of course, to decide whether or not we were [Leslie] Nichols prosecuted Huskey he committed before the killings, securing convictions in 1996 sending Huskey to prison. But the murder trial would [Randy] I misjudged it tremendously. [Leslie] The defense argued insanity. And in his closing arguments, Moncier even channeled one of [Herb] I walked over and got on &quot;My name's Kyle! I hate Tommy!&quot; &quot;I wanna get rid of Tommy! &quot;I hate him!&quot; Like that, then I got up off the witness stand and said, &quot;Now that's your witness.&quot; &quot;You believe that?&quot; [Leslie] Nichols believed it was a cunning act. [Randy] I'll go to my grave believing that the... the last victim he had literally to the mobile home where he lived, and I don't believe that she [Leslie] Unable to come up The deadlock made a mistrial. Then, in a twist, courts rolled and credibility of evidence flawed, meaning a retrial would be unlikely. [Randy] I would have made some other strategies. I've lived it a lot. [Leslie] Today, the Zoo Man remains but he will never serve a [Randy] In my view, he should never I believe him to be a very dangerous man. [Leslie] As for the four women killed, no one was ever convicted for their murders. [Music fades] [Becker] Online right now, all of and how you can help authorities One of those stories is Michelle Anderson. In January of 1987, that Fulton High School junior, who Her remains were found two years later. Anderson had attended a party invited Investigators say he gave the alcohol and pot and supposedly She was never seen alive again. Larry Lee Smith is a convicted currently serving a sentence in Tennessee. He will never get out of prison. Authorities say he preyed on women for 40 years. He is behind bars for aggravated In 2021, he challenged his guilty verdicts, but a judge said no. He has never been charged with One of Knoxville's oldest unsolved murder cases happened in the 1960s to a Knoxville The 68-year-old was baking a cake when someone stabbed and beat Those familiar with the case dressed as police officers to get inside that home. Although the next murder case the case moved to our area because From the outside, it looked like He was a Yale graduate, fluent in five languages But in reality, there were cracks in In March of 1976, Bishop brutally murdered his family in Maryland, dumping their bodies in the North Carolina woods and abandoning his car at the Elkmont Campground and has never been seen since. Again, that was in 1975. And an artist created a model of what He hasn't been seen in almost 45 years. In November of 2021, we shared an update about this case with the story of Kathy Gillcrist. Through a DNA test, she found out that she is The FBI finally did its own DNA testing and confirmed there was a new lead in the case. [Kathy] She told me that she but yes, the evidence showed that It was kind of creepy when It did make me pause for a minute and say, &quot;Wait a minute, this is scary.&quot; It started on Mother's Day. I started getting these phone calls. [Phone ringing] [Man] I'm 99.9% sure I know who he is. [Kathy] He swore that Brad in a little shack of some A message from an EMT, and he said, &quot;I've been trying to reach you&quot; &quot;because I know I treated [Silence] [Becker] Kathy says she thinks Bishop is still alive, and if she did meet him, You can watch all of our Appalachian For the United States' most prolific serial killer, murder was an obsession. Samuel Little admitted to killing 93 women in a 35-year killing spree across America. His victims included at least but he never was charged with their crimes. Little was a cruel man who thought of nothing of including one woman who lay dying. We take a closer look at what you want to see, but first, a warning, this story [David] Everybody described him as really a nice, gentle person when you first met him, slick. I mean, a good talker, able to talk [Becker] Sometime around Christmas 1974, a killer came to town. By the time he left, he'd notched another victim. A drifter, a thief, Ohio native Samuel Little murdered Knoxvillian Martha Cunningham, likely on New Year's Eve night 1974. Little preyed on prostitutes, addicts. Cunningham was no prostitute, but she was vulnerable. A woman of God cursed to Family members had last heard The 34-year-old was supposed to [David] From what he told us was that he had seen her And then on New Year's Eve, he'd brought her out to the woods, [Becker] Veteran lawman David Davenport suspects Little drove her from the Magnolia area heading east about 15 minutes toward a spot where no one could hear her He left her body splayed on the ground. Little treated her like so many of his victims, robbing her of any dignity, leaving her slip and dress up over her chest and her stockings and panties No respect, no regard. Hunters found her body Fate would deal Martha Cunningham another in dignity. Records show authorities didn't Despite the circumstances, out by herself in a remote investigators found no signs of foul play. The autopsy's conclusion, &quot;No Decades passed, eventually only family and And then, in 2018, Little decided Once prosecutors promised Little he started talking about all Not one, not 10, not 20 killings. No, he confessed to murdering 93 women starting in 1970 when he was 30 years old. He drew pictures of many of their faces, claiming he had a photographic memory. [Becker] To the surprise of Knox County investigators, his confessions included Cunningham who he remembered as Martha. The FBI alerted the sheriff's office. Working cold cases for the county, Davenport checked out Little's story. [David] He'd give us so many things about her that made us believe that he was telling the truth. [Becker] The old convict claimed in Knoxville around the same time. [David] And from what he described, he dumped her body somewhere but we never could find anything [Becker] That woman's body has never been found. Samuel Little died in a Texas prison Investigative journalist and my colleague John North has worked many of these And John, let's talk about this case in particular, mishandled from the get-go. [North] It's kind of extraordinary and a I mean, if you come upon been dead several weeks, their genitals are exposed, their clothing clearly has been pulled down, you don't think it's a natural. [Becker] You don't. Let's talk about other things that stood [North] Well, one thing that strikes me is well, first of all, we didn't even We had completely forgotten, the until Samuel Little himself came &quot;Oh, by the way, I killed a woman That's just amazing. And it was the cold case investigator in 2018 then had to go back and try to assemble [Becker] John, we're going to get to it in a second, but technology is helping [North] Yeah, it's incredible. Almost every day now, we are seeing breaks locally, statewide, nationally in cases simply because DNA profiling has [Becker] Investigative journalist John North, you can read more of his reporting and other Appalachian Unsolved cases. Finally, today, modern technology into mysterious deaths, including a 1985 case where the remains of a teenager were found in a remote area of Campbell For years, they were referred to as &quot;baby girl.&quot; But just a few months ago, and we now know her Here is more from Leslie Ackerson. [Bill] You normally don't find young females just lying around dead in the woods, you know? [Projector slides clicking] [Leslie] Leading the forensic team was [Bill] That tells me she's a teenager, right there, that she is not over 16. [Leslie] Bass believes the key [Bill] That is dental work, So she grew up in a family that valued dental care. We wrote about 60 to 80 dentists in the We didn't hear from any of them. If a dentist could see that I think they would know whether [Leslie] Nature tells Bass the remains had been there before their first discovery. [Bill] I think she's been could be more. [Silence] [Becker] Investigators want you to This was one of 156... She was 15 or 16 when she went missing in 1978. That was from Indiana. Again, this case is unsolved. Authorities say if you can help, It's one case that that legendary has remembered all these years later [Bill] DNA has probably been the See, 20 years ago, we really didn't have DNA. I mean, we thought about it and tinkered with it and see if we could make it work. But now, we know what it is, how to do it, and... you're gonna see more human identifications in the next few years because of the use of DNA in it.
