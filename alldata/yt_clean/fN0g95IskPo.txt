Hello, I'm Erico\/- It might be a bit early, but Christmas is just around the corner. So, I came to IKEA to shop for Christmas. I arrived two hours before closing, but I started with a meal anyway. Haha Boy friend: &quot;Why did we get a keema curry dog as soon as we got to IKEA?&quot; (So delicious! I could keep eating it!) IKEA Kohoku is already decked out for Christmas, which is exciting. This year, I skipped Halloween because I was busy traveling, so I really want to enjoy Christmas to the fullest...! &quot;My goal this time is to buy,&quot; &quot;paper napkins.&quot; &quot;Last year, they were completely sold out,&quot; &quot;and all they had left were red paper napkins.&quot; &quot;Do you remember?&quot; Boy friend: &quot;Yeah, I remember!&quot; &quot;We were like, 'There are no cute ones!'&quot; &quot;they only had the bright red napkins.&quot; &quot;I think they'll be popular again this year, so I absolutely have to get the napkins!&quot; In this showroom area, I tend to linger, but then three or four hours can pass by in no time. Since we have less than two hours until closing, I need to focus on Christmas...! Everything looks so cute in the layout that it's hard to decide... &quot;This, the scoop... oh, this one!&quot; &quot;I saw a post saying it's recommended for Christmas storage.&quot; Boyfriend: &quot;If it's not medium-sized, won't the Christmas tree not fit?&quot; &quot;Shall we try buying it?&quot; Boy friend: &quot;Let's do that.&quot; I can't help but get distracted by things that aren't related to Christmas. This yellow blanket is so cute! It has a subtle Christmas feel. And then I made a little detour to check out an item I've been wanting for a long time...! &quot;I looked everywhere for this about a year ago, but I couldn't find it!&quot; &quot;Even when they restocked, it sold out right away.&quot; &quot;I gave up and reluctantly bought something else, remember?&quot; &quot;That was cute too, though.&quot; &quot;And now... look...!&quot; There are so many donut lamps that I couldn't get before!! &quot;When I see so many, it makes me feel like I should buy a bunch.&quot; &quot;Even though I think it's cute.&quot; I'll explain later what I did with the lamps. Haha There are so many Christmas goods in front of the register! It feels like it's the same across all stores? The Christmas fairy, Tomte, I bought last year is back this year. &quot;I've grown attached to this little guy.&quot; &quot;He brings good luck.&quot; The decorative items, like this miniature house and paper crafts, are so cute...! The idea of stacking KNAGGLIG is amazing! The dog plush toys have such adorable expressions. And again, here are the Tomtes. I'm looking forward to the paper items section. I'm going to check out the paper items section that I was looking forward to. This season seems to have a lot of bold patterns, so I'll choose carefully while mixing and matching patterns. &quot;Just an ordinary placemat.&quot; &quot;I'll take four of these!&quot; I arrived at the paper napkin area~! This year, I got here right after the release, so I was able to find cute designs. &quot;These look easy to use!&quot; &quot;I really like this one at first glance.&quot; IKEA has a really wide variety of tree ornaments. My top pick this year is probably this uniquely shaped one. &quot;I'm interested in this!&quot; &quot;Should I buy two?&quot; Boy friend: &quot;Yeah, it seems better to have about two.&quot; &quot;I'm worried it might be too red.&quot; &quot;What do you think?&quot; Boy friend: &quot;I can understand that.&quot; Boy friend: &quot;Our home is colorful already.&quot; &quot;Yeah, we already have a colorful home.&quot; &quot;I think a color like this would be just right.&quot; There are so many cute light decorations. I feel like there are more star lights this year! I couldn't bring last year's Christmas goods from Australia, so I have to repurchase almost everything from scratch... tears. I can't help but be drawn to these boys. Haha Imagining the layout. So, it was a fun shopping time\/- I want to show you the Christmas items I bought at IKEA, but first, I'll arrange this week's flowers. I chose some flowers that feel a bit like Christmas. This greenery called Blue Ice feels very Christmasy! I'll put it in my newly bought flower vase. I brought it from Finland, but I'll share more about that in a future video. The opening of the vase is quite wide, so I'm struggling with arranging the flowers...! The flower shop I go to always has a totally different selection, which is fun. I usually choose the flowers that catch my eye based on what's available that day. This week, I chose these chrysanthemums. I love how they stand out and brighten up the space. For the side table, I went with deep orange and purple for a chic touch. Now that I've arranged the flowers, let's start introducing the Christmas goods! So many...! Haha, let's begin\/- First, let's start with these Tomtes. I had one at home last year and grew attached, so this year I got four. You can't see their expressions, but their little poses are so comforting. I'll display them a bit. I also bought this yellow blanket. It has a subtle Christmas feel, perfect for winter! This cushion with a patchwork-like embroidery is cute. The lively pattern will make a nice accent! This cushion cover is a calming black color. I also bought extra cushions. I'm excited to decorate with the cushions and blankets. Next up, the tableware. I want to pair them with the white plates I bought at IKEA last year, so I chose simple red placemats. Just in case I have guests, I bought four. The napkins I've been dreaming of are these two patterns. They're definitely cute...! Next, for the paper items. I picked wrapping materials for the boxes under the tree. Two sets of mini bags. They look useful and could even be used as ornaments! I chose green and red wrapping paper. I thought a mix of bold patterns and simple designs would create a nice balance. I might have gotten a bit too much? Haha, I also bought white and striped twine.\/- Next are the lighting items. There were many types of star lamps, but I chose the simplest one. This should also serve as a nice accent for Christmas. I didn't forget to buy light bulbs and cables. I also got a small lantern and decorative light. All white with a touch of gold. The color scheme is so cute...!!! I went with a simple blue-gray for the lantern. Next, let's move on to the tree ornaments. The star for the top of the tree and the lights that wrap around. I decided to buy two this year since one wasn't enough last year. Hmm, it seems I have to attach the string myself...! This year, I'm particularly drawn to clear colors items. This favorite ornament is also clear. It's solid glass and has a nice weight, giving it a luxurious feel! I selected this one because it's inexpensive and comes in bulk, which is great for filling in gaps. It looks like they can be displayed in various ways, like putting them in glass containers! And of course, I bought a tree as well! They come in various heights, but I chose a 180 cm one. This year, the leaf density seems to have increased a bit, so I'm looking forward to assembling it...! I bought a storage bag for the tree, the SKUBB. I chose a medium size of 69x55x19 cm, but I wonder if it will fit? Oh! It fit, even if it's at an angle. It looks good that I can store the ornaments in the gaps too! I bought this Santa Claus mat that makes me wonder where to place it! Haha And finally, the only thing I bought that isn't related to Christmas. I've been thinking about it for months, so I finally bought it...! It's just so cute and plump. I'm going to use it a lot. So that's how I ended up buying a lot for this year's IKEA Christmas. I'll soon share a vlog of the Christmas decorations, so look forward to it~! See you in the next video. Come back and hang out again~\/-
