- Today, we're gonna be reacting to some of the biggest Among And we're gonna give $5,000 so make sure you watch to - Who's gonna win? - Dude, the first one's Toast. - Toast. - You know a little bit - Toast is a handsome devil. He's probably known as to play Among Us. Here it is. - See, I love venting, venting makes it feel so much better. - Toast came out of the vent. - Rae knows. Rae knows. for his kill cool down, he's making a lap. - Oh, she knows. - Oh, my god. This is like a horror movie. And then he just vents - Oh, my god, he's so proud of that one. - Trained freaking assassin. - Hey, look. He said the caption. - He said the thing. - He did the thing. - That was a large brain - I don't know if it's $5,000 worthy, but it was pretty big brain. - Oh, 5up. - Ooh. - 5up's so smart. Double kill here, yes. - He did the wiggle. He did the wiggle. - You know it's coming Oh, do the wiggle. Is this the same round? Pokimane, no. Oh, my gosh, beating Moxy. Is this all in the same round? - Oh. Bro. That was really good teamwork, which is really hard when you - He did three double kills in one game. - Wow. It's the wig. - It's the wig. - No, not Charlie. How could you? - Oh. Oh God. - There's no chance, right? How does he get out of it? Hold on, I gotta listen. - It is not unfortunate. I just saw the kill when I walked out to see who was there. - Oh, come on. No chance this work. we didn't go for Ludwig. - He got out? That was such a bad kill. - I mean, that was just on everybody else's account. - No, this is actually... It's a different type of 5head play, okay. - It's so dumb-- 5head play. A man great with his words. Graced with fantastic facial features. And that's what got him ahead. Anyway. - Anyway. - Here he is, XQC in Let's hear it out. Oh, let's hit lights? Let's hit that vent? - Oh not Greek, okay. - Oh. - Oh, he was doing the upload. No chance. - I am self report... I mean... Oh . I mean, I reported the body. Greek, what-- That's a stereotypical light vent kill. - I don't know. That was pretty good. - That was very good. Might've seen it better before. Ooh. This is Corpse, switches over here. Does lights, vents back in. - Nice. - Look how close this is. Rae didn't see him. Rae didn't. - No. I don't know who did it. - Oh my God. - Oh, big brain. - That was-- - He got away with it. We haven't seen all the clips yet but that might be a $5,000. - That looks like a - And plus I just wanna - This is a $5,000 play right here. Trust me. I don't even need to see the clip. - This is the AFK strat perfected. 5up, the mastermind. - Yeah, but here's the thing-- - Wait. - This is 5,000 worthy. - Here, I'll let it play why it's not $5,000 worthy. - So Karl does the thing so it looks like he's - On top of Karl. - Hello? protecting you, Karl. - Oh no. - Karl is not imposter. I'm gonna clear Karl of being imposter. Thank you, CouRage for just, for no reason hard vouching. - Listen, I earned that hard vouch. That was the most meta gaming play that's ever existed. - Some people, like me, I have a child. Sometimes I have to go AFK, don't abuse the AFK strat. - Ooh, Rae got a clip. Here we go. - No, she's gonna kill Nogla. I love, Nogla. - No gla. Oh dead. No chance she gets out of this, right? - I saw him going there, one second ago and I thought I'd find him alive. But he's dead. - And there's nobody in there? - No, I think they vented out. - Oh, she went all the way to the edge. - That's a pretty good play. Look at her proud of herself down there. - She used the crew mates - Yep. - Gotta give it the Corpse so far, in my opinion. Corpse or me. They've all been insane. These are massive brain plays. Here's XQC again. - So does that mean he gets two chances? I guess if you have that - You know, stop being such a big brain if you don't want five grand. A Goblin, imagine. Oh, lights are off. Lights are off. - Wait, are they? I don't think lights were off. I think they just had less vision. He did the light strat - Wow. - That was perfect. - That was literally-- - Look at him. He was even shocked that he did that. - He couldn't believe it. - Saw Asim kill White. - Also Sophia hard that she saw him kill him-- - That's pretty big brain. - That was massive brain. - I can just feel his brain just throb. - I need Peter here to kill both of them. - Oh. - Ask and you shall receive. - Oh my God. - Dude, it was like she's summoned him. - And Sykkuno's gonna vouch now 'cause he's such a - Sykkuno is a perfect man. That's good teamwork. - That is good teamwork. That's insane teamwork. Holy cow, that one was good. 5up. In my opinion, 5up's the king of Among Us. - I can agree with that. - Lights are off. - Oh. - That had to be... Whyne, did you murder that person or did someone vent and kill? - I'm downloading. I don't know what happened. - Oh my gosh. These vent kills are insane. Just the fact that they can That's some large cranium gameplay. - His cerebral cortex is just expanding. - Charlie. - All right, Charlie wins. Look at this. He has some big brains right here. He has PewDiePie, Toast and Leslie. Here we go. - Charlie's probably one of, my opinions, the best Among Us players. - He plays so weird, but it's so good. - Yeah, he's hard to guess - Huh? - Oh my god, it's Charlie. - All right, so that's a self report She must have gone in and killed Felix behind me on O2. - It's Charlie. - Oh my God. - Okay, well we can Toast watched me do - But you're gonna lose as soon as you vote Charlie... As soon as you vote me. You can win-- - I'm so sorry, Toast. I'm so sorry. - Wow, see that's why Toast-- - Yeah, that's why Charlie's so good. - Yo, Charlie's on the map for that one. Charlie's on the leaderboard. - That might be a $5,000 clip - That that's up there. Masayoshi, here we go. - I'm gonna psychoanalyze John here. - So we got a social play here. - Oh, this is a play for Toast. - He gets accused, he will start to sentence with two words. Why or how. And you just how. YouTube video, I'm voting John. - Guys. - You're gonna trust Toast? - Toast just had destroyed him. - Toast psychoanalyzed the man and got him out based on that. - That's not even fun at that point. Toast is just too good. Toast is the high school - I don't like those kind of plays though. I like to keep it fun. - Oh, how about another Here we go, Toast. Uh oh, there's Leslie. - Hmm, where did Leslie go? Leslie name every task you have done. - Okay, I did the wires and then I did the leaf blowing one. - She's the bad guy. - She's the bad guy. - Name every task? What? do trash. - See? - Leslie, you can't fake it. You can't fake those. - Lily didn't say anything so I think it's her. argument's supposed to... I don't know what to say. It's not me. - Aw, poor Lily. Guys, are we playing the - I hate-- We're the best Poki. We the best. - He voted her, pushed a button and then - That was insane. - That Toast, Poki collab. - So do you think that was big enough to pass Charlie's big brain? - No, actually, I don't know if I'd put - I would. - But this isn't the best play so far. - Yeah. - All right, more Corpse. - There's just too many-- - Sykkuno's so sweet Oh. - Oh no. - He's gonna blame Rae. - It's Corpse. Edison in front me. - Okay, I will stay with Corpse. - Okay. - No way-- - Rae just-- - Trusting the gut here. - Oh. you're a genius. - Just kill me. - He kept him alive - So he could kill-- - He's a murderer. - Oh my God. - We've got a new contester - Another Charlie clip. Here we go. - Toast. Do you wanna explain yourself, Toast? - Look Jack, you gotta believe me, man. - I literally stayed back - It's Toast Charlie and Jacksepticeye. Holy cow. Putting Jacksepticeye in a 50/50. - Saw Charlie pass by. - Oh, poor Jack. - I watched you kill-- - Charlie is about to play him. - Oh God. It's all up to me now, isn't it? Charlie's the 50/50 God. - Honestly at this point Sean, it's gonna be a he said, she said battle, and you're gonna have have to use that beautiful brain of yours. - Oh. - I'm just gonna let but Toast has not stopped - I voted. I'll give you the choice. - That is insane. - That was pretty big. - That one is better than his first one. - Yeah. Lazar. - No matter what they asked me, I'm saying one word and that word is interesting. - Detective Bean, what are you doing? - Interesting. - Where were you? - Interesting. - I'm voting Lannan off this . - The body's in electrical and my boy Vik, did you not see the body when you were running out of electrical? - That's so good for late... Interesting what happened to his face. - Why'd you vote for me? - Oh my God. They voted Nogla? - Interesting. - He's gonna win by saying interesting. - Oh, there it is. - Interesting. - That was a very interesting clip. - He won off one word. - He only said one word. the whole game. I would've voted him off 'cause that's annoying. We have to donate five grand to one of the biggest plays of this game, this video. my winner pick is gonna be Charlie with the social play here. He framed it all on Toast and made Jacksepticeye vote him off. - But this isn't my pick. No, Lannan won from saying one word. I think Lannan deserves the 5k. - I think Charlie deserves it. There's only one way to settle this. One and done. - Here it is. - Scissors, rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Charlie. All right, let's go donate. - Use hammer or lance. What the ? Is that... Thank you for the $5,000. Is that actually you Mr. Beast?
