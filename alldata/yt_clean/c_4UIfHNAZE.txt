&quot;It was the ultimate flying machine, no airplane can live up to what the x-15 did&quot;, that's what retired test pilot and astronaut Joe angle said of the first real space plane and 50 years after it's record-breaking flight of October 3rd 1967 when US Air Force test pilot William J Knight achieves a top speed of mach 6.72, 4519 miles an hour or 7273 km/h it is still the fastest manned powered aircraft and if you thought the SR-71 blackbird was the fastest jet then you're absolutely correct because the X-15 wasn't a jet, it was a rocket-powered single seater aircraft that looked a bit like an oversized art and had to be launched from the underside of a modified B-52 at 45,000 feet because the XLR 99 rocket engine would burn through all of its fuel in just two minutes. Not only did the x-15 set speed records it also went past the point of were space officially starts at 100 kilometers 62.1 miles on two occasions both times piloted by Joseph A Walker at at 105.9km, 347,000 feet and 107.8km 353,000 feet. Although in the 1960s the US Air Force considered space for start at 80 kilometers or 50 mile,s any crew that flew over the 50 mile limit were awarded an astronaut badge, 13 of the X-15 flights went higher than this and two of the pilots Neil Armstrong and Joe Engle went on to become fully fledged astronauts in the Apollo and space shuttle programs. But apart from being a record-breaking aircraft research from the X-15 program led to things like the first full pressure suit that would work in space, the first use of reaction controls the little gas jets at position spacecraft in space, the first use of super alloys in the plane structure that could withstand the heat of a hypersonic reentry and the development of the first large restartable throttleable rocket engine, the XLR 99. These are a small selection of the developments and discoveries that would go on to contribute to later space programs including the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and the Space Shuttle. in the early 1950s research that started with a bell X-1 the first supersonic plane began looking into the problems that would be encountered by space flight. At the time it was still unknown as to what would happen to the stability as well as other issues of a craft when traveling at hypersonic speeds that's between Mach 5 and Mach 10 or between about or between about 3800 and 7,700 mph ( 6,200 to 12,400 km/h). This will be the type of speed that would be required to get to the edge of space and the re-entry. In 1952 the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics or in NACA, NASA's predecessor started looking into the problems. By 1954 they had contacted both the US Navy and the Air Force to propose building a research aircraft that would become the X-15. By 1956 the contract for the airframe had gone to North American Aviation and the rocket engine was to be built by Reaction Motors. After the contract had been awarded to North American and before the launch of Sputnik in october 1957, North American had considered making an X-15B orbital space plane that would carry a crew of two by launching it into low-earth orbit on top of a pair of SM-64 in Navajo missile boosters. If this had been done it could have predated the Space Shuttle by over 20 years. However after Sputnik the X-15B orbital space plane idea was shelved and revived several times until it was finally over taken by the mercury space program when NACA became NASA in 1958. In 1960 NASA considered using the b-52 an X-15 as a launch system for the Blue Scout rocket to carry small satellites into orbit. The B-52 would be the first stage with the x-15 being the second stage carrying the Blue Scout which will be the third stage to 180,000 feet before it was launched, the payload into orbit. This idea of using high-performance aircraft as launch platforms is now gaining interest once more as a method of launching for new generation and nano satellites into orbit. Three X-15's were built and performed 199 missions over a nine-year period from 1959 to 1968. Due to delays in the engine development the first 24 flights used to smaller XLR 11 engines but in 1960 the XLR-99 engines were fitted over tripling the thrust to 57,000 pounds and these will be used throughout the remainder of the flight programs. The X-15 generally performed two types of research flight paths, level high speed runs at around a 100,000 feet and altitude runs where it would try to fly as high as possible. because of the speeds that the x-15 could reach, the temperature on the exposed areas like the leading edges of the wings and the nose could reach 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit or 650 degrees celsius at mach 6. The fuselage was made from titanium and covered Inconel X, a nickel chromium based super alloy used to make the thrust chamber in the Saturn F1 engines and could withstand the high temperatures without weakening. Although Inconel was capable of withstanding the heat stress, the stresses that built up between the hot and cooler areas was causing concern as NASA was looking at testing a hypersonic ramjet engine that in theory could push the X-15 to around Mach 8 that's around 6,000 miles an hour or 9,900 km/h. NASA were also looking for an ablative coating, that's a layer of material the burns and turns the gas to protect the structure underneath and could easily be applied to reusable spacecraft to cut the refurbishment costs and turnaround times, the X-15 would be an ideal test bed for this type of heat shield. After a minor crash in 1967 the second X-15 was rebuilt and renamed the X-15A-2 it was extended by 28&quot; about 71 centimeters for the extra hydrogen tanks of a proposed ramjet engine and fitted with detachable auxiliary fuel tanks that increase the flight time by 60 seconds. It was also coated in an experimental ablative coating. It took six weeks to apply of a spray-on coating and when it was done the X-15A-2 was now white instead black. It was also fitted with a dummy ramjet to test the design but during the record-breaking flight of October 3rd 1967, it also revealed major issues data from the flight showed that in places like the nose cone and the wing edges whilst the coating had worked it also prevented the Inconel structure underneath to cool as it was designed and it nearly brought about the structural failure of the X-15 due to the uneven heat stresses that had built up, also when the craft reached mach 6 the gases released from the ablator turned the cockpit glass opaque so the pilot could no longer see out of it. Luckily one of the two windows have been fitted with a metal eyelid which was raised before the landing so he could use the other unaffected window. Due to unexpected air flow problems the temperature was so high that the dummy ramjet was seriously heat damaged and three of the four explosive bolts which held it to the mounting pylon ignited, it was then ripped from the aircraft as the final bolt failed and this was the end of the ramjet powered X-15. It was said that the X-15A-2 came back looking like a burnt-out firework and whilst it was sent to be refurbished the idea of the ablative coating was dropped due to the problems of getting an adequate depth of the ablator over the structure. Due to the research nature of the X-15 there were accidents and incidents with some of the test flights but there was only one fatal crash on the 15th November 1967, when Air Force test pilot Major Michael J Adams lost control at 230,000 feet with the X-15 entering a Mach 5 spin. There were no recommended techniques to recover from a supersonic spin as no one knew what the X-15 would do in such a situation. Although Adams tried to recover it, at 65,000 feet whilst traveling at Mach 3.93 and tumbling through the air the X-15 broke up scattering the wreckage over a 50 square mile area. As the 1960s drew to a close and after the fatal crash, support within NASA of the X-15 project waned, many of the major research goals have been completed in the years before and now spacecraft were the new priority. The last flight took place on the 24th October 1968 piloted by Bill Dana and within a year the remaining X-15's were retired and one of the most influential aircraft research programs was shut down for good. The two remaining X-15's are now on display in the National Air and Space Museum Washington DC and in the National Museum of United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
