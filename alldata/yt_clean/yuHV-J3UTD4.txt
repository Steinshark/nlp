Hello and welcome (back) to my channel on my search for a burr grinder for the LaPavoni ...I stumbled upon this coffee grinder from the 1950's I'm aware that those grinders are not grinding fine enough for espresso... ...but I liked it so much that I made it my new project anyway The condition of this glass is a miracle But the adjustment is blocked to both ends And the cap is damaged twice Its also not running at all Lets take it apart I've never seen such worn brushes before Everything seems to be gummed The grinding discs are very small and worn And as expected they are quite rough The adjustment is also gummed up I need to drive it out from the backside I use a screw to get a grip on the internal part And clamp it with the vise This part spins the beans into the grinding discs It's secured with a left-hand thread Together with the grinding disc its attached to the electric engine Next I remove the damaged cable The type plate is in good condition I drive out the rivets with a small nail Next I take the electric engine apart Now we know where the brushes went This is the rotor of the engine I have to desolder the stator Its press fitted into the casing With heat I expand the casing I set the heat gun to 400degC After a few minutes I can push out the stator Now only this bearing needs to come off No problem with a bearing puller Disassembly completed The hard rubber I clean and soften with detergent I mix detergent with water 1:1 and let it sit for a week The gummed up parts get cleaned with ultrasound 10 minutes at 90degC Ultra sonic = ultra nice The rest gets a quick bath too Too my surprise even the paint was washed off Paint stripper for one hour will do the rest Most parts are made from aluminium Only the stand is cast iron The casing is in good condition I only sand it with 240 grit-400 grit I polish the elevated ring This part I sand by hand with same grits As the cast iron immediately builds up surface rust... ...it is sandblasted I will remove cast marks and rough surfaces I use some heat resistant filler for the remaining dents First I coat with one layer of primer Bake it for 15 mins at 180degC And then I continue with RAL6026 "Opal Green&quot; The polished rings turned out beautiful Speaking of polishing...more stuff to be shiny I only buff them up with blue compound and the soft wheel Now I continue with the plastic parts I have further broken it open to be able to glue it In order to recast this cap, I need to fix the original first Because this one is the template for my mold I use 2K filler to repair the melted bit Now it looks worse, but it is a better template I glue on dowels as riser tubes in the later mold Then I use molding silicone to create my two-piece mold It cures within 30 minutes, so I need to be fast When the first pour is cured, I pour the second one When its all cured I remove the original cap Now I can fill the mold with clear 2K resin After casting, I suck out all the air in the vacuum Now I need to remove all cast marks I sand it up to 1500 grit And polish with car polish And thats it The bean funnel is yellowed I will try to retrobright it I bath it in hydrogen peroxide (7%) for 2 days During this time I shine UV light on the setup Okay that worked quite well Now its also time to check on the rubber All clean and re-softend The rotor is cleaned with isopropanol The surface rusted stator I brush off This increases connectivity The switch is cleaned with isopropanol and steel wool #0000 So on to the grinding discs...... This never made or will make a fine coffee powder New ones are not available anymore So I need to rework the ones I have And try to make them finer But first I have to soften the hardened steel I heat it to 800degC and let it cool slowly. Next I need some mounting device I need a strong base to later do some milling So I drill a tight fit whole for the mount From the back I cut a thread into the block Now I have a adjustable mount I can screw the grinding disc to I mill tooth by tooth What a nice task this was The coffee bean later enters on the inside... ...and gets grinded down to the outside Since this outside contour defines the final grain... ...I need to do some fine tuning on this part Now I need to harden it again I heat up over 800degC... ...and quench it in oil Afterwards I temper at 180degC for 2hrs in the oven They are finer than ever before, but still rather small And thats all I can do I go right to assembly Beer Tasting from now on in the end of the videos Explanation on this decision in video description In order to press on the case I heat it up Also this part is heated up to 120degC I hope this time you approve of my soldering Final bearing test I grease them with an unspecified food grade grease As specifing the grease triggers some view apparently ;D The lighting does not favor a completely nice powder coating finish I adjust it to finest setting The pin is then aligned with the blocker for the finest setting New brushes of course I recreated the decals of course Aaaaaaand its done And I came prepared for the haters Since I did do the mold I thought: Why not save two old machines? But on the other one I had to recast both plastic parts My oh my, did this decision prolong the project The white one is two years younger Please consider to subscribe Of course I have to test them It works well But the grind is not suitable for espresso So the search continues Its way finer than the video suggests btw Everything is done So its time for a beer This time I test a "Hurner Helles" I bought it in bavaria I will rate Entry, Aftertaste, Body... ...Colour, Bitterness, Acidity and Fizz... ...on a scale of 1 = bad till 6 = great. I rate one beer in each video The colour is a solid yellow And the fizz is strong with this one Lets see how it tastes And here are the results
