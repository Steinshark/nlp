Wow. He is extremely calm. Show me. Between two boxes, between two boxes. Is it enough? That's it. We will launch it here and see what transpires. Something is perceptible, yet not distinct. Can we do it? No, let's see if it works. I'll launch it right now. And the barrels, see? There are also barrels on the side. What is your gift? Uh-huh. They often stay until the conclusion. Yes. Where is the adhesive tape? More than three. A shot fired at the house. Plus. So what? We are preparing a shot in that direction. Yes. Awaiting takeoff. Ask him if he... He is in touch. Hunting? Yes, that's correct. The FPV drone control team cannot independently reach the location and initiate filming. We first require support from intelligence. They assist us significantly; we couldn't manage without them. The Mavic team supports our colleagues who fly and identify targets for us. Plus. Head south. Head south. Yes. Zoom out. Go left. Go left, they are returning. Stop. The target has been located. We are eager to launch the drone. There are numerous individuals and insufficient equipment. Consequently, we are increasingly experiencing collisions with people. And we utilize traditional high-explosive shells. It's a piece of shrapnel. This is something for us... Fortunate, isn't it? This marks the onset of a fresh era, one could argue, of autonomous forces. Now, at last, our government is manufacturing its own bombs. Yes. The mass production was conducted by the Come Back Alive charity foundation, if I'm not mistaken. They provide us with these shells. The shells have demonstrated their effectiveness quite impressively. Especially with their capsules. It is effective because we used to create shells at home, or we were provided with shells that we had to optimize ourselves. If someone chooses to admire our beauty, they perceive this allure and a one-kilogram projectile hurtles towards them. He ties his shoes. No, he's ducking, he already understands. FPV is being prepared. But don't move. And it begins. First, we direct the FPV drone to the target. Upon arrival, it hovers, initiates a search for the enemy, and successfully locates it. And he attacks. He begins to jump and shoot. End of the trench? Yes. No, they fled for some reason. They are firing at you. It's all so futile. They cannot escape. They can't do anything. Oh, it's beautiful! That's the way it should be. Heh heh heh This bomb is designed for infantry fragmentation. Next, we have... Crimea will be demonstrated to you now. Cumulative and fragmentary cumulative. This is for tanks and cars. The shells are cumulative; they are for equipment such as BMPs, tanks, vehicles, and so forth. It is targeted at tanks. The second projectile is a multi-purpose one. This is a blend of high-explosive and fragmentation weaponry. This system can be employed against infantry as well as vehicles. Aim carefully. If you hit him, he won't be able to proceed. Well, typically we aim for the rear. Ugh. In the mind. Contextually. Armor exists. So what? It won't save him. Covering up. He has an additional bulletproof vest. Ugh. He is already wounded. Well, a grenade had just landed near him. Good work. Atom, come on. Let's finish them off. Now, regrettably, due to weather conditions, the frequency of contact hunting has diminished. Our primary quarry is not as accessible; they typically do not ascend in this manner. Now they are hiding in burrows, they are scared. Uh-huh. The proliferation of FPV drones has been tremendous. The Ukrainian military is not remaining idle, we are acquiring a substantial quantity of FPV drones. And it instills fear. They are fearful and they seek shelter. The moment they detect the drone's buzz, they take flight to the furthest extent possible. We will end it. No suicidal waste, we will use a grenade. It was a kamikaze drone. Come on. We have kamikaze drones and drones designed for grenade deployment. Uh-huh. Kamikaze drones prove more efficient primarily due to their capacity to carry greater weight. There is no requirement to append extra components to them. As a general rule, a drone carrying a grenade does not lower its camera; you must aim at them from afar. When you need to infiltrate a bunker, you can't do that with a grenade. If this Russian is eliminated now, we could potentially toss a grenade at the entrance of the dugout. You see, he climbed into the dugout. This is where you can toss a grenade effectively. Is it challenging to navigate a drone into a dugout? Now they are hanging all types of curtains. If a large number are present, the curtain will not provide protection. A first-person view drone armed with a projectile can easily demolish it. Tossed aside. Almost missed. Anyway, it nearly struck the entrance. We almost wanted to hit it right there. Uh-huh. And then, more effective shells are launched. Yes. No, it's a powerful vehicle and tank missile. It's not. I'm sorry, but there's no text provided to correct. Could you please provide the text you want to be corrected? No, that one. Here. When we discovered a dugout that required demolition, a shell weighing one and a half kilograms, filled with shrapnel, came hurtling towards us. The first one arrived, making it easy to visit. Then, a similar object appeared. Roger that. Like cockroaches, yet... Atoms, they are alive. You demolished the refuge, perhaps you should venture there again and hurl a grenade. We will be right back. Shrapnel is the primary threat, followed by a significant amount of TNT. The secondary danger is contusion. It could occur, or their ammunition might explode, and then there will be a display akin to fireworks. Most of the time, when we breach the bunker, they panic and that's it. Alternatively, if they're courageous, they stay put. It's fine, we'll take care of them. Do you possess anything combustible? The box is going to ignite. Do you have any flammable items? Regrettably, we lack a source of fire. We have a shard and a mine. We will retaliate by hurling these boxes, equipped with a mine. We monitor them day and night with our drones. We observed a dugout, into which someone dashed during the night. We deployed the drone. Instead of leaving, four additional individuals entered. That's it, dawn has broken. With the initial echo of mortars, a drone takes flight and strikes the adversary. Well, friends, let's get going. Yes, it is very specific. They visited us, how could we not present them with such a gift? FPV will launch now. Who? Starex is our pilot. Infantry adores individuals with First-Person View. I'm sorry, but there's no text provided for correction. Please provide the text that needs to be corrected. There is a lesion, a negative. Yes? Without the mortar. You know, he... That's it for now. I believe it was about eight kilograms. Emotions? How to articulate this... Well, this shelter... There is an enemy bunker housing a machine gunner. You pilot a drone and drop a mine directly into the bunker. The ammunition explodes, and you get the sense that you've accomplished something significant. Many are here. We experience emotions not because we suppress them, but because we free ourselves. That's the reason why we have emotions. We observe him stepping over the bodies of his comrades. &quot;Why did you venture here? Can't you deduce from these lifeless bodies that this is the 'end of the line'? They are about to perish now. They will all succumb to their wounds. They are all seated there. Their demise is imminent. The enemy dreads FPV as if it were death itself. They recognize the distinctive hum of the FPV drone. When the FPV is in flight, its sound is unlike that of other drones. It emits a more resonant hum. We must flee. Upon hearing a drone, he takes cover. A single drone arrives, another departs. The remaining one remains hidden, not revealing itself until the end of the day. They are extremely scared. This bird flew right into my shoulder. It definitely works. Indeed, the drone struck me on the shoulder and did not detonate. Had it detonated, I would have been reduced to nothing. A drone struck me here and fractured my collarbone. That's why I assert it didn't explode. It was merely that on the ninth, I was reborn. Show me. No explosion. Not a blast. Look, he's making a fool of himself! Look! Ha-ha-ha! Look! It wasn't an explosion. The mine landed beside them but didn't detonate. Look, he's scaring himself. FPV is a formidable force. It strikes with precision. It's fifty-fifty. If you're fortunate, the next FPV will arrive and you might not be so fortunate. They are also scared of FPV and Mavic. Because our Mavics can fly and locate targets. The subsequent one arrives, releases a mine, and boom! That's it, it's done. We will approach from the east. Take this into account. Yes, and there they are, close by. You see, two figures. That's your target. Yes. Hit! Not far away. Well, here's one. One is lying on the ground. Yes, we are working. We damage troop carriers less now. They're intelligent, equipped with limited gear and numerous personnel. They are now more cautious with armored vehicles. Their buggy was going one hundred and twenty kilometers per hour, and we caught up with it. We can see it. He is leaving the shelter. Sixteenth, seventeenth points. No, elevate it even more, it doesn't matter. Good. What? Raise it a bit higher. A person who has graduated from an FPV flight school still needs to have at least some combat experience. Piloting a drone is easy to learn and then successfully execute... No. Yes. Upon graduating from school, we soldered everything ourselves, essentially inventing everything from scratch. In other words, everything that we have accomplished up to this point was done by us. We fixed it. That is... So, let's just assume that we handle all the repairs and soldering ourselves. Fought long? I've battled for eighteen months. Upon arrival, I commenced FPV operations. &quot;Have you got video and data?&quot; en-US original text All set? There you go. Please place it here. I was mobilized. It was my birthday, so I decided to go for a ride. And then I was halted. Dear... Do you wish to engage in combat? Here is your conscription notice. Please sign here. Well, I signed it. You're in luck. I celebrated to the fullest. When is your birthday? Me? January thirtieth. Where did you enjoy January thirtieth? In Vinnytsia. From Vinnytsia? I'm from Vinnytsia. I was a technologist, I was working. I was brought here because of my job as a sapper. Yes. They asked, &quot;Do you know how to operate a computer?&quot; I sat down, clicked, and demonstrated. &quot;You open this,&quot; I instructed, &quot;then you crop the image.&quot; Have you ever flown a Mavic? I used to fly drones in the area. I was skilled. Alright, you will enlist in the Armed Forces and become a pilot. Correspondents. Yes, they are now on their way to... I meant that... Okay, okay, I get it. When you soar, let them sit. What is it? Do they glow? When a projectile whizzes by, it soars through the air. It has already flown by. Freedom. Real freedom. We live one day at a time. Yes. As unbelievable as it may seem, it is indeed the truth. But we have hope, right? A person cannot live without hope. The horizon will ignite. Yes, something is igniting and soaring there. What are these exits? It is light. It was a gift from the One Hundred Eighteenth Brigade. Is there a place for me here? Yes. Thank you. You've had quite a bustling day with us today. We eagerly anticipate your next visit. We consider ourselves fortunate to have had your company today. And we were fortunate. Thank you, it's a pleasure. It will cheer you up. But you are indeed very courageous individuals standing here. Not everyone would have had the audacity to come here, I assure you, even the military. Take care of yourself. We are both brave. My goodness, I almost called someone on the two-way radio. Are we waiting or sitting down? Alright, alright, alright. We are here. Where is the press? Get on the armored personnel carrier. Wait, do not drive off yet. Are you two? Yes. Sit down, sit down. Hand me your backpack. Where's my bag? It's not ours. Sasha, take a seat here, take a seat. Be well! Thank you, and you too! Do you have a grip? Hold on very tightly. We are trying. I lost something. Give me your backpack, I'll take it with me. A minibus arrived. We are vacating the post. That's it. Don't record, as we may tumble. We must grip very firmly.
