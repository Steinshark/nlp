Why is my desktop in OneDrive? Hi, everyone. askleo.com. Here's a question that I think is the confusion that OneDrive has basically I have OneDrive Every time I set up a new computer, desktop and fills it with icons Is it possible to remove the desktop And what will that do to the desktop I would actually like each computer each one serves a different purpose. This gets messy. It's going to be an interesting one is pretty important. The issue here is that because the desktop and it's stored apparently in OneDrive, that you've enabled a feature Like I said, it really What's happened here is that you've likely enabled the OneDrive backup feature. To be clear, it's neither a true consider it a feature because of I have an article, that goes to this in more detail. Like I said, it's extremely likely that backup feature has been turned on. Now, you may not have Microsoft is very insistent and pesters you repeatedly without In fact, many of these opportunities don't even mention the fact Now, the three things Folders, like your desktop, others, are effectively Their contents are then, Com online. And then also the contents of other folders, are copied to your machine in to use the same OneDrive account. Like I said, the The fourth issue to undo the damage. What I'm going to do is walk with your desktop folder, what and then we'll walk through the steps Over here in Windows 11, It's in the left-hand You can see I've got a PDF on my desktop. It shows in my desktop folder. To be clear, this folder, this desktop folder, actually lives in C:users Leon. Leon is my login name for this It is the original default, Like I said, it's just a folder. The magic, if you will, is that whatever you put in the folder If I were to create a new shortcut here, you can see right away, even before I've created the shortcut, We have the new it shows up immediately on the desktop. I'm going to cancel that That's the desktop folder. That's how it normally operates, Now, OneDrive gets its hands on it. When you enable OneDrive Now, like I said, it's very easy to enable OneDrive's backup you're enabling the things that are about to happen. Let's enable OneDrive backup. I've got OneDrive running here. You can see I've already got in the right-hand Windows File Explorer. I'm going to go to OneDrive, and then manage backup. This is the feature we're talking If I turn on backing up of my desktop, I want you to take a close look at what happens to the desktop folders we have. On the left-hand side, we have untouched by OneDrive. Then in the right-hand OneDrive, the OneDrive folder. Nothing special about it either. I'm going to go back and turn and we'll save changes. Now, if you notice right I'm going to close the settings here All of a sudden, in OneDrive, Okay. On the left-hand side, This is the desktop folder, again, where show up on our desktop automatically. But this is not the folder it used to be. If we now take a look at the properties this folder, desktop, now lives in It's in one drive. What that means is that anything in the one drive/ desktop folder synchronizes and copies that to Com cloud storage. That's what OneDrive does. It keeps the OneDrive folder on your PC So far, so good. This actually doesn't seem that horrible. All we've really done is we've created We've moved everything into the new desktop folder in OneDrive, C:usersleon-desktop, is actually removed. That doesn't exist anymore. The only desktop folder present on your Like I said, nothing appears to change. It's really not that bad On the surface, it's not really that bad. However, remember that OneDrive Its primary feature, its primary the OneDrive folder, on your PC Com cloud storage for that same account. We already saw, what that means within the OneDrive folder on your PC, But the reverse is also true. If you add a file to your oneDrive. Com cloud storage, it's then automatically Where things get weird and really match is if you have multiple PCs all Then, If the backup feature is turned on on those PCs, they will beautifully do exactly what we just saw here. The contents copied into the OneDrive desktop folder. It will be uploaded to OneDrive because But then everything that is not already on your desktop but is in the cloud a desktop will get downloaded to your PC. Essentially, what happens is of these machines will end up containing the merge, the combination of what was in all of those individual desktop folders That's probably not what you want. Okay, so how do we undo the damage? Well, of course, we'll We're going to go back to OneDrive and you can see that it recognizes that, desktop folder being backed up. It's the one folder I've got turned I'll turn it off. Are you sure you want to stop backing up. Honestly, this is probably of this because backing up is good. I talk about it over and over on my videos, on my articles. And yet this backup, for reasons It's not a good backup, and in many So they're basically playing against to convince you to continue to use Don't. Don't believe it. Don't use it. Now, once again, we're going the various folders behind us Not a lot happened. Onedrive OneDrive certainly didn't change. There's still a desktop folder But now, the desktop folder First, let's take a look at exactly there's really only two things that The desktop folder that was originally switched to User's Lyon OneDrive desktop, is now back to User's Lyon desktop. It is no longer within OneDrive. Great. However, in Instead of moving our files to the desktop folder that Like I said, it hasn't In fact, if we take a look within this online backup PDF is still here. It's not on the desktop is no longer the system desktop folder. I know. You can see, though, that showed up on the real desktop, That tells us that this folder the real desktop desktop for our machine. Again, I created a new shortcut, I hit cancel, it goes The only thing that happened was that the but instead of copying the data placed in that folder to the folder How do we get those files back? Well, unfortunately, Windows/OneDrive doesn't know which files should be moved back. Remember, if you've got multiple will have a collection of files that came It won't know which one move them back manually yourself. In this case, pretty straightforward. I've got in this OneDrive desktop the document that I wanted All I really need to do is copy it If you want to get fancy about it, so that it gets moved to the desktop. That will remove it and remove it from all the other machines Boom, it's back. The file you want on your desktop So far, you've turned off for that desktop folder, although I Then you've copied or moved from that you want to have present on the real There is still some cleanup to be done. For example, you can delete that shortcut. It's just a shortcut to Well, there's nothing there anymore. We know how to get to it I'm just going to go ahead from the desktop as well Now, if and only if in OneDrive has nothing in it, have the one file that we were dealing or you know that there is nothing on any of the machines that are associated you can delete it. Boom. Yeah, it definitely deletes it. Online only folder, permanent removes it. That's exactly what we want. Boom. The desktop folder is gone. This then is pretty close We have the real desktop folder Users, username, desktop. Onedrive is no longer involved with anything in the cloud. Now, If you have other machines as again, the original question indicated, of on each of those other machines, for that folder, individual machine to that individual and then cleaning up by deleting whatever folder or deleting that OneDrive desktop in it you care about anymore. But again, you'll have to repeat that for with this OneDrive account on which It's confusing. And please don't hesitate to I also want to point to that goes along with this video. It's askleo. Com/174275, because once again, of everything that I've just gone over, the same process step by step. Between the article and this video, and you now know how to undo it if that's what you want to do. My bottom line is don't Use OneDrive. Onedrive is a fine file But that feature that they added is confusing and risky, and in the worst Understand how the feature works, which, like I said, Stadley And consider instead keeping your Don't use Windows documents other standard folders they have. That way, Microsoft and OneDrive won't Onedrive, honestly, it's a great service. Until it isn't, because we've stumbled Onedrive is a frequent topic in my weekly newsletter.
