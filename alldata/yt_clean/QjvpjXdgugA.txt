This is the most and this is just one of many dangerous and extreme laser mazes Whichever one of these ten contestants Everyone, follow me. Welcome to room number one. You freaking kidding me? Yo! How are we supposed The rules are simple. You need to go touch that But you touch a laser, The billion dollar question Oh, okay. We have our first go. What in the world, bros? - I'm stressing out. The craziest part is this is the It gets so much harder after this. Okay. She's giving Number 1 no space All right, y'all, This might look like a game, This $250,000 Okay, good, good, good, good, good. All right. It's coming towards you. Oh my God. Oh my goodness. Hey... No! Am I out? Did I just...? Oh my God. Only nine remain. Oh, yes. You got it. All right. We got our second. I'm stuck. Where am I close? Where am I close? - Let's go, baby. That was surprisingly close. - Yeah. And by the way, because in the last video, the entire planet. This is 100% real. Stop asking me that. Turn on the lasers. A little overwhelming. Very scared. In order to complete this level, will have to navigate this course All while the red laser walls Stay down the middle. And trust me when I say I tried it earlier and didn't Start level two. Okay, we're going. We're going. Oh, man, bro. Hey, move the wall faster. Go, go, go, go, go, go. What the hell is this? Go, go, go, go, go, go. Good job. Hurry. Go, go, go. That's cutting it close. I didn't even know we were starting. I thought he was just doing an intro That was a little scary. I had to sprint through that, Follow me to the next set. Now everyone here may look happy, Not all of you survived. Someone actually hit the laser. I'll be back with the footage. Did anyone see it? I don't think I touched the laser, I just want to make it I was like the second one so I feel like I had enough space I don't know. We'll see. I didn't think I had it a laser. But if I'm the last person like it might be me. - My heart is just beating out my chest. I know. On this iPad, I don't want to look. All right, everyone, Oh gosh. So here's culprit number one. It's me. It hit your shoulder, It was actually impressive If we all want to salute him as he leaves. - Bye, guys. It's been really an honor. Up next, if you look right here, You'll notice he didn't get out. It was actually you. Yeah. Oh my God. I don't know why you all are sad. Five remain. And now we can be happy. But unfortunately, that happiness Welcome to the next level. Isn't this insane? What in the world is this? I know it's a lot to process, When the timer starts, you have 10 walk across a balance beam, and then jump to safety, Start the timer. I got this. I got this. I should have got on. Hey, this is insane. That beam is wobbling, dude. Let's go, Rain. 7 minutes left. I'm good right here. - Are you going? Okay. So how are we doing this? I don't know, I'm not going to lie. That's for you all to figure out. We're stepping up. All right, here I go. All right. Two is on the balance beam? Okay. This is it. - Yes! Girl power. Who run the world? Girls! Time's running out. Hurry up. Maybe you all go at the same time. Oh, she did it. Oh, there's two! Nice and easy. All right, let's see it. Only 4 minutes remain. - Turn around. - Yes! Girl Power! Oh my God!

Death beams. I spent $42 You don't think Welcome to level four. What are we looking at over there? I can't tell. My heart is beating like crazy, bro. Boys. Fire the death beams. Oh! What the...? Yo! What? So as you'll see before it fires, Your goal is simple. Reach the other side without touching or getting absolutely cremated Have fun. Underneath it. Number six is safe. Eight's safe. Let me take that. I'm good, I'm good, I'm good. Okay. Oh, man. It's only number four. I think he made it. Give me the box. Here, touch the box. Dubs baby. Let's go. That one got the adrenaline pumping. I'm glad four of you survive because, nine and ten, So I hope you don't all lose soon. But to be honest, if someone didn't lose What the heck is this? Come inside the prison. Close the laser door. Oh, bro. You're now trapped And at some random point in the next for exactly three and a half seconds, and you'll have to run before they turn back on, you know how - And how massive this room is? - No way. When do you ever get 10 hours the biggest three How long can a person I've gone like 48 hours for sure. - No problem. I was, like, playing You think we're actually I think we are. It's pretty intimidating, not going to lie. Simon says touch the laser. I don't know what the we might find out pretty soon. Turn off the lasers. Please. I'm really hungry. - Yeah. We ain't getting no food. And if they bring dinner in here, and they bring some kind of food. Oh, sheesh! How's it going? Just wanted to make sure you're awake. - We're awake. How many hours I think we're going on three. It's been six and a half hours and you're We also brought you guys some Prime. Thanks, KSI. - This is your first time trying Prime? Let's see it. - Your first ever sip of Prime. - What do you think of it? I was surprised as well. It tastes pretty good. - Enjoy your Prime and food. Thank you. - 6 hours? It's not been 6 hours. The minute these turn off, I'm out. This is starting to get not fun. I do not spend all this time in here to not touch that box. Do you know the the slower you're You're going to be done for. 10 minutes to 10 hours, Like what kind of range is that, What are you doing to us right now? This is crazy. I feel like an animal in a cage. It's five in the morning and The stakes are high. They're all staring at the money. It's getting primal. But if we press this button, for three and a half seconds. You may press the button. Will they make it? Will they make it? They all got it. That felt like the end of the world. Oh, my gosh. How are all of you that alert? It is 5 a.m. That was 7 hours. We're just that determined. Because nobody got out, we're going to have to run it back - I'm kidding, that was a joke It's been way too long of a day. We're like, &quot;What?&quot; We're like, &quot;Wait a minute.&quot; But days are kind of irrelevant A giant spaceship. Come on in. - What... - ...in the world? Come on in. So welcome to Level seven. Dude. You're probably wondering, why am I holding so much prime? It's because Prime Hydration is a zero This bad boy is only 20 calories, coconut water and enough vitamins and electrolytes going throughout the entire video, all without And because the company is founded if you do this course I'll give you $10,000. - Holding a bottle or the whole tray? Here you go. Catch. Each contestant needs to hold from platform to platform The lasers will briefly disappear to try what seems to be the easy Or they can make the jump. My heart is pounding. - Can I go? Yeah, you go first, if you want. Dude, I wanna take my time. Okay, I think I can make that. Oh, he just jumped. What the heck? The thing is, the further I don't know if I can jump that. Nice, Rain. Oh, this is scary. Are you going to jump it Once she jumps, I'll jump. All right, bet. Just in case. Just in case. You see, I knew it was coming. That was smart. Okay, now my adrenaline is pumping. - Yes! We're good. That was good. You went so far. I don't know if I touched it, though. We got to look at the camera footage. We're going to replay that, Karl, what's the verdict? Number 8 is eliminated. You definitely hit it, I promise. We'll still give you It's official. Oh, no, I'm sorry. It hurts. It hurts. But, you know... Hey, grab that 10 grand briefcase Prime makes it taste a little bit See you, dude. Thanks Jimmy. No problem, thanks for coming out. - You have a great day. I'm sorry. Life is crazy right now. And now three remain. Number 4 isn't ready, You're good, you're good. How does your heart feel? Better. I'm going this next time. Don't play no games with me, okay? She got it. I'm going to get out the way. All right. We have our first finisher. Thank you! Oh, look at those feet. Straight shot, baby. He almost broke it. Dude, I lost my first step. Don't kiss my money. Why's he kissing my money? Last one remaining. That's a lot of pressure. Okay. Okay! We have three finishers. Yeah. And these next three levels are going to determine Welcome to Level seven. You have two choices. You can either eliminate yourself keep competing for a chance What will it be? There's like a billion lasers You think If you're a quiter, You have a guaranteed There's a way through these lasers, Of course. - You're being annoying. That's the car I wanted. Give me money! - All right. - Okay. Go get your cars, ladies. If all three of you go over here to get it, I'm going to send it. I want to make it to Room 10. This is actually because you know they're doing it - Yeah, I know. you can drive it out today. There's a chance you walk over - You don't want the money? Turning it down? Look at this thing. Five, four, three, two. You can walk out with this car. One... Just go get the car. Take your pick. I know. - I'm sorry. You'll probably hate me. Free car or a chance to win money. I'm going to go with... The money. - Let's do it. Head on down there. I cannot believe nobody Go ahead, Rain. You waited long enough. Dang! I'm good. Look, I got to make sure Dude, that is so tight. Yeah, that is tight. There's two paths I think she's going Oh, my gosh. You are, like, She's about to shimmy Well, a chance at 250. - You have one little choke-point left. I'm coming, Karl. I can see you right now and Hit that. Yeah. Touch that. All right, we have our first finisher. I did it. I did it. You could do anything. Ten, if they both touch lasers, you win. - Six... it's not a race. This isn't NASCAR. - I know, I just... I'm just scared if I don't go through this, Let's go! All right, one more. Everyone focus your attention on four. This is the hardest part right here. It gets very, very narrow. Oh, watch your foot. Will his butt hit it? I know it hasn't. I said, &quot;will&quot;. Oh, my God, I'm literally sweating. That is so tight. I need to get out of here, Can I do that? I approve. You can jump over Yes, if he can clear this wall, He might win this whole thing. You think it'd be easier to jump over and jump back over I mean, maybe not easier, doing that. Just to be clear, Now, who's the one I can clear that, I'm doing it. He did it. That was crazy. You two thought Look at their faces. What the heck? - Now he's walking along the edge. He's going to have to jump back now. Dude, We didn't build the set with this He's literally breaking the game. And our set, apparently. These walls aren't super strong because we didn't If you fall, you're out. This is insane. No way he did it. What the frick just happened? Let's just go to the other room. Follow me to the in-between room. That was the craziest thing Starting out when Did any of you all think I saw both of you as a threat. You all are like the same person. If you were silhouettes, As long as I keep going first, Honestly, I have to trust in myself I won't lose. Complete honesty, That's why Let's go to the next room. Now, making a bunch of so I had my friends - Welcome. - Hey. This level only has three lasers. I let each of the boys place a laser, on this level. Turn on Nolan's laser. I call this one the &quot;up and down&quot;. That's not that crazy. I'd call it pathetic. Turn on Tareq's laser. I call this one side to side. Very creative. What do you guys think of it so far? - That's pretty crazy. Now turn on Karl's laser. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And there you go. Level 8 is these three lasers. Not a fan of the green one. Hey, guys, you're supposed to run, not sit. Hey, why don't you guys - I see the path. Oh, he's gone. What the heck? Hey no pressure, guys. He didn't even say he was going. He just. He just went. What just happened? I blinked, I know I wasn't saying much, everything out We officially have If they both get out, No pressure, fellas. Oh, she's going. All right, our second go. The green hit her. It's up to you, Yei! The only thing standing between number four If you get out, he officially wins. This is... I don't know, dude. You got to show me I'm really scared. What'll get you out? - The Karl laser. The Nolan laser, the Tareq laser. Oh, she's gone. Okay, the red one. She did it. She did it! - She made it! Well, I feel like she made that Did the laser touch me? No, you did it. Are you sure? Didn't hit a laser. What? You got to be kidding me. Oh, my gosh. It's time for us Only one of you is going to survive Basically, it's a level - Okay. - Are we fighting? Laser tag? I'm going to launch a nuke I have no reason for doing it. I just wanted to. Let's see who wins $250,000. I'm nervous. Yeah, this is a mental challenge. Going on 5:00 AM right here. But I came this this far. I'm in confident It's like, what, 5:00 AM? Yes. I don't even know. I'm tired. But I got to do every and just like, I hope they both win. - That's just not how it works. Just add suspense. We made them wait a few hours. This sucks. I know. I hate it so much. Waiting's making me nervous. Oh, my God. I can't believe you both said no It's top three. You got it. Go big or go home. In your mind, what are the 100%. Really? I feel confident. Well, he's pretty confident, I hope I win, You guys have any last words? Not really. I'll shake your hand. And now we're enemies. Welcome to the final level. For this last level, into one. Player number six come in. My Lord. Hold there for one second. Player number four, come on in. Holy smokes. Okay. Since there's only two of you, You either touch the money first, instantly winning it, or your opponent touches a laser thus they're eliminated Number four, does that make sense? I hear you out loud and clear. Number six, does that make sense? Makes sense. I'm going to give you both 30 seconds This is for all the marbles. I want to win this. Dude, my heart is... Dude, he looks so nervous right now. If you try to run this, I'm just standing there. I got to play offense. Ten more seconds. Yep, as fast as I can. Release the dogs. I'm going to send it. I'm not waiting for him to mess up. Say the word Jimmy. I'm not waiting. Three. Two. One. Begin. All right. Like I thought Blake is going for it. He is way ahead. Okay. All right, they're about tied. Okay, so far no one's out. That was close. Blake is way ahead. Okay. Her only hope is that he ends up He hit a laser. What? - He did, he hit it. You're lying. No, hey cut the lasers off. It doesn't matter. - What? Don't headbutt it. Are you okay? What? And obviously, Blake, we're going of another $10,000. because he won $10,000 I know it's not a quarter of a mil. - Here's another ten grand. Do you want me to deliver it or would you prefer me I want you to bring it to me - What if they try to rob you? I'll wire you the money. I hope you guys enjoy it. You can stand in it. Just, you're going to sink, so be careful. - Yeah. You see what I mean?
