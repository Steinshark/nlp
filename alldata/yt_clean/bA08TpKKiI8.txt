Well, who has a degree in physics. And who was a teacher, All of which was well before he became lead guitarist rock groups. And I'm talking about Brian May. Brian you are very welcome to the show. Brian is one of the most eccentric people He's quite brilliant. When we met, And he happens to be a damn fine to work with at times. Every time I'm in the same room with Brian Yeah. I haven't hit him yet. But there's still time. My mum says I wanted to be a surgeon, There always was this thing about me felt that I'd missed out on life And I thought that running around looking for the right woman I was a bit restricted because my parents you shouldn't do too much going out. You should stay home and do your homework, get your academic stuff right. And then when you're about 20 years old you know. So I was a bit too sheltered probably because I was a bit And whenever I did go out to those things, I used to think, I don't know what to wear. How did you first get involved How old were you when you started? Very young. I think 7 or 8 years old. Did you have formal musical training? Yes, but not for the guitar. I had piano lessons from the age of... ... 11 to 13. Something like that. But the things I got interested in which I used to play. And it's an easy thing to pick up chords And my father taught me 3 or 4 chords, and I went from there. And that was the time when, or soon after that time anyway, it was the time when skiffle came My dad helped me make this tiny and it had earphones. So when I was supposed I was under the covers listening to Radio Luxembourg and hearing And it was the very exciting time We used to listen to everybody you could get your hands on, you know, and you'd competition to see and earliest. I was listening So it was, it was very cool to say: well I of course I don't really like I like Chuck Berry and But secretly everyone was going home and My dad was a great, electronics So me Really it happened I couldn't afford a Stratocaster And we thought: "We can make a guitar." Maybe we can make something And so we drew out our own designs, So it's all made from strange objects. Pieces of junk, really. A fireplace. A saddlebag holder, a knitting needle. Some motorbike valve springs. You made the knobs. Oh yes, Pieces of mother I always know when Brian has put a bit on somebody else's record. Now, even if he hasn't told me, And eventually and we used to go around in, you know, one mum's living room Eventually we played our first gig. I remember what it was This is way before 1984, you know. I was happy here, but I was also very lonely here, And I was one of those people I also played very hard, you know, but I wasn't really a social animal. We would always sit in the same place from physics would always sit over here, that would always sit over there. And I remember being totally in love and I never, ever talk to her, You know, you know, I'm this very confident person, very much as a student and sort of, by the system. The first time I heard Brian play ever I was...I was particully impressed with the sort of touch and had a musicality I hadn't heard before. And it's a sort of part. It's touch It's very, very musical, very, melodic style. My recollection is the same of Roger, really. I never seen anybody tune a drum before. The drummers I knew just sort of play it he hit it a lot. So Roger was doing these very, very musical rolls on the snare, And I remember thinking...That's... heard that kind of thing before. And it was when "Smile" broke up, and... Brian and I decided we liked working together, and we wanted to form a new band In the fast moving field of fashion, London leads the way! A trendsetter city, with the emphasis on youth! The attraction of Biba, was that the girls who worked in And they were dressed just right, you And we used to just go in there I know Freddie did as well. One of those ladies was Mary, And I met Mary at a concert in Imperial College, my own college, because she was sitting behind me. I was pretty shy, but somehow And we went out a few times. She was very wary of anyone, and so we would generally just sort of and a quick peck on the cheek, We never really got beyond that. But there came a point where Freddie it became obvious that Freddie And I said, well, we're not really going out and such, So I'll introduce you to her. So I did. I think we had very little idea We had a few dreams, a few ambitions. We said we had to take this as a serious commodity. I would like to go digital. So that took a lot of planning, in a sort of, And that's what you really wanted to do, Brian was the main man to really make sure that he wanted a serious musician. When we nearly disbanded But I think something kept us going At that point I thought, well... It's a fair deal. You know, I've given all I can to this, that if I don't pick up the guitar for the rest of my life. We had incredible belief in ourselves, I mean, quite blind and ridiculous belief But we did have this kind of belief that we could do anything The biggest thing and have an album on a piece of plastic so that people could buy it, children could still buy it, And the second thing was to to play some of the concert They would like to introduce to you Brian May on the piano. He says he's wonderful. He's got a big car. I think it's our style. If we do something, then we do it to excess, And...Yeah, it's very overblown, it's very over the top, That's the way are. I mean... There is a fashion at the moment but we've always thought it was important even with groups who aren't that people notice how things are done First of all, you notice the kind of... My dad was very against it, Because he...I think he saw in my education that he would have liked to have got to. He never got his degree, So he saw me with this fantastic degree in science And it looked like So yeah, he was very upset or so, maybe more. And the funny thing was, you know, he was very against this, but all the time he was drawing little maps and and charts And he was following with great detail, So he was always kind of into it. He just didn't say that to me. We were playing Madison Square Garden and said : Look dad, It's New York. It's the first time we play this Come over! And they came to the gig, and my dad said: "Okay!" He said: "Okay, I get it now!" Freddie: &lt;i&gt;Thank you, God bless you!&lt;/i&gt; Freddie: &lt;i&gt;It's a pleasure doing business with you!&lt;/i&gt; Thank you Madison Square Garden... It's not the answer to life's I think, that music has a place in people's lives, And not all of us can go and solve the problems in Cambodia, you know? And, that's what we do, I don't feel ashamed of that. And especially I don't feel ashamed in this way If anything I would say for Freddie... I would say... Impulsive. Means "acting on impulse". I would say... Thoughtful. And for Roger... I hope they don'tfind out what I said! For Roger, I would say... I whised there was a special word for it... Hedonistic! Try that one! It means "pleasure seeking"! How about writing lyrics? Does it differ Or do the lyrics and Normally together. Normally lyrics arrive with the words, on the last few. Yeah, writing helps me a lot. And if I'm not writing, I think there's something wrong with my life at the time. of. Have you this thing in the computer? Yeah, yeah, Brian's got his own sort of writing ideas But anyway, so, I mean, he's just, I don't seem to be able no. Yeah. But in a way, that's quite good. I'd rather leave it to him. And, it doesn't mean I just stay out of it And love, as he said, please, let us be are be other and more. show off. little bit of a bit. 0343. Like a lot of us. you know, mommy, me love them all. The, sort of all of us will be, Oh. For me... songwriting is sometimes on the guitar, I think most of the ideas come From the mechanics of playing music. So I find if I can get away, into a room of my own then something will come into your head than if you're sitting down But once the ideas are there, once Then you pick up the guitar And so me, I think because my apprenticeship in guitar playing If I write a song, which has a particular idea behind it I then go take it to the other three and want to do it in a different way, and some of their input will be very good and some of it will probably actually So you've got to be there's all this interaction And Freddie sings much better than I do, you know, the original meaning of the song Now, when I became aware of this, so that it had a wider meaning, knowing that it would change And the motivation, the challenge is to actually get in the right way that moves people. A song called Keep Yourself Alive was meant to be very sort of ironic, And I was saying, Keep Yourself Alive You know, you should there should be more But it became keep yourself alive And I had no control over that. And I watched sort of open mouthed, So after that, I was always aware of I used to imagine what it would be like in front of 20,000 people singing a song, So in a song like "It's late", I tried to broaden it which was compatible with, and his inner feelings and also Generally, in the simplest form, tape recorder I used to carry around, on a piece of paper, So I think I just &lt;i&gt;This is a blues one.&lt;/i&gt; Enduring. Do do do do do do do do. At that time, you know what it needs. You know, you can hear the whole thing of actually putting it on tape, "We Will Rock You" has been with us for so long Then I suppose...And it says a lot Says a lot, I think still about humanity. I don't usually tell people this, you know, I'd seen people in football doing stuff, And I thought it would be the easiest thing in the world for people *clap* with the hands. Right? So I could just... People can do that And then they can sing this chant But actually, as far as I can tell, football clubs and all kinds of teams which makes me very proud and very happy. I think the way it's done And that's probably because they're standing on concrete But I noticed that in the concerts, after while they would go And it's only people like the, you know, "New kids on the block" So me stop me. It was a time when Queen, this band, as boys, had matured and become something Incredible. We had hit singles everywhere. The members of Queen had become slightly, I think, irritated with each other You know, we've been touring, recording to the whole time In 1983, we decided we needed a break, most vividly is waking up in L.A., thinking I could do anything today. The sun is shining. I've got friends here. And that's what happened. How did you fall in love with Starfleet? Oh, I was definitely a fan! It was my little boy, to tell you, He used to say : Daddy! Daddy get up! It's time for Starfleet! and, we used to watch it. I was very keen on the, the music. We used to get a couple of verses one day I should do something. This would be great. I can hear it I got on the phone to Ed Van Halen. "Fancy coming in the studio?" "Yeah!" I mean, yeah. Phil Chen. bass player keyboard player He'd done a lot of stuff on Radio Gaga. Magnificent keyboard player, actually. And Alan Gratzer, who's, lives about 30 yards And we talked before. "Wouldn't it "You never know..." Well, this was the moment. &lt;font color=#FF0A44FF&gt;HS: When did you get married?&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0A44FF&gt;HS: How many years...&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FFAE00FF&gt;BM: It's a longer story then that...&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0A44FF&gt;HS: How many years ago?&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FFAE00FF&gt;BM: I was married for about 15 years or so,&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;HS: But you must have met her when she was like a model...up&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FFAE00FF&gt;BM: She was a student&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;HS: Oh really?&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;HS : You mean you met her before&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FFAE00FF&gt;BM: Yeah.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;HS: Oh, no kidding.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;HS: Oh, yeah.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;HS: How are you kidding?&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;HS: Oh, absolutely.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FFAE00FF&gt;BM: I think we grew apart.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;HS: Grew apart! That's it!&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;HS: That's it! Grew apart.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;HS: Because, you know, once you&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;achieve a certain degree of fame, women&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;HS: True?&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FFAE00FF&gt;BM: When I get famous, I'll tell you Howard.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;HS: Yes?&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;HS: You know, you're very famous.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;HS: And the point is, what happened with you&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;and all these things.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;HS: But what happened&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;HS: You have probably 18, 19 year old&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;HS: I mean, let's be honest.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FFAE00FF&gt;BM: Well...&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;HS: You were a good person,&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FF0000FF&gt;HS: True? &lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FFAE00FF&gt;BM: Yeah, but also there was something else&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#FFAE00FF&gt;BM: There was also the fact that actually&lt;/font&gt; I think I had a nice smooth growth up to the point Queen was this stadium band, I had a nice mom and dad. I had a nice wife and a band, which seemed to ever be increasing in stature. And I was having a wonderful And then more or less, My father died... I split up with my wife... over a long period during You know, in which time I couldn't move. I got very depressed... What stops you killing yourself? I think what stopped me children and people who depended on In a sense, it's a very selfish thing to kill yourself You know, you do terrible things That would have been awful I would like to tell you that there was a glimmer of hope there, So I stuck in England for much too long. That's when I decided to make the solo album, I need something which can be the beginnings of me I lost mostly identity. What I'm seriously planning doing some stuff on my own now, and I hope to go out and play somewhere Seems that probably won't Because I'm getting very, very itchy. And so I just want to get out there! So, you know... more writing, and I'm doing stuff Just more fiddling, I realized that if I did not deal with the depression, So it's the same kind of logic Killing yourself is really bad But also staying in depression I did kind of chuck my life in and he checked myself Actually the best thing I ever did It's like restarting your car, you know? And I had to ditch my preconceptions. And that work Yeah, it wasn't instant, in a slightly different way. But when I fell in love with this woman there was absolutely no way Well, Anita was an amazing force and still is. means that I love loving baby. I know what that means. But I don't mean, &lt;i&gt;The media launch for "Talking of love"&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;plumed new depths of boredom&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;with the usual Fleet Street leggers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and speculating on the exact nature&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Brian and Anita,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Could this be the joys of love?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Eeventually,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Yes, exactly.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Can you please be quiet?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Where did you first meet?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;We met at "Down and Out" in Beverly Hills,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He had to climb over me to get to&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He and his wife. Bouth!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Actually, I take up a lot of room at movies!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Are you?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;I thought wouldn't it be wonderful if &lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;this wonderful voice, on a record.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The way it should be done, you know, to&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;My voice is going croacky&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;cause I've been talking&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Brian rang me up, said: &lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;"Do you want to hear it?"&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And played it down the telephone! &lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Yeah, I could tell, really impressed!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Anita and Brian have obviously set up&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but how did they feel about front page&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Initially I thought, I hate it&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But like, it's&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And when I actually read it,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;because it was so obviously preposterous.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And I could go through every line and tell you,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;you know, there's&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;How does all this make you feel then?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Well, I suppose it's something&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;I'm just thrilled that Brian's&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;taking it in the spirit that he has,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that eventually that would happen&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They'd say I was having an affair&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And I was a little bit apprehensive&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But as Brian said, it was so stupid&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;You know, there's not time, really.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;You know, I mean...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;That's what I mean.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Send the marriage proposals!&lt;/i&gt; My relationship with her had to be secret at that time, which is not nice. Really? Yeah. The last time I saw Freddie was... Anita and I went down to see him, with the curtains open And I think I was talking about things "Oh look that is very interesting." And he said: "Guys, you don't need to feel I'm just so happy that you're here." "So even if we say nothing, We were together for most of my adult life, not much more than 20, And it's really like losing a brother. &lt;i&gt;This is Fredderick Mercury signing off!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Bye bye!&lt;/i&gt; The first three were quite awkward. When I was supposed to be singing Combining the two is quite difficult, and also making this connection People pay their money, you know, and you really, you have an obligation you know, it's not enough "Well, this is what I do." Every. Week we play. Them until it's done. &lt;i&gt;I tell you something, I ain't even going to try this. This is....&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;This is impossible to play with.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;I ain't even going to try&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;So we do something else.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Okay?&lt;/i&gt; Well. I. &lt;i&gt;What was the time&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The image of Freddie...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Freddie Mercury is stronger than ever for you?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Why do you think he was kept it...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Secret for so long?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Freddie's influence&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Absolutely. Everywhere.&lt;/i&gt; You know, one of the first in my body. A wonderful right. On top. It was good opening for Guns n' Roses? Opening for Guns n' Roses. They were great. There were a fantastic audience, and it gave me a great feeling of satisfaction and the fact that they didn't after we finished playing. You probably saw a lot of cool Their backstage is very similar Oh yeah? Who's a better guitar player? You or Slash? He probably is. Here in the. We live in Britain, this brand is scraping crew. I am on top. Of a beautiful new thing on a company never to move in free world. The rest, you know. Yeah. I was doing "Resurrection" when Freddie was going And I thought, you know, his body's is getting stronger and stronger. And, so I really enjoyed "Resurrection", you know, it brought me up. And I think that's the high point You know, "To much love will kill you" the blackest. You know... There's very little hoping that song. But in "Resurrection", it's all like, terrible with this wreckage, I'm I'm on my way. And. I wrote "Nothing but blue" to a backing track, But I wrote it the night before Freddie that it was just about to happen. So, I wrote the song around But even in the midst of that, I don't know if I'm a songwriter, I'm thinking about his life losing him, And again, it relates to my theme. You know, it relates to how... You know, how did Freddie see this? You know, how did he see his way out of the black spots? Because Freddie also had some very I thought, you know, what you learn from is this incredible You know, if he couldn't "I don't I don't even to think about it!" "I'm off here, He would wrench himself out and forward, So that's the feeling that I got. And that's what I try to put in that song. You know, I'm very sad, but there's still this feeling that I'm So the album is up and down but also kind of optimistic mixture Yeah. Well, I only found it gradually. And I think if you listen to the album, but there's this theme running through it, of the same piece of life, And each time there's a different feeling, Like I'm scared, It's very touching and chaotic The beginning is like a That's right, like a song to the baby. Exactly. Yeah. What's the future of Queen at this moment? Is sort of future Queen. I think the only future is the past, I think there's a great future for the It will always live in some form, but I don't think we can go out Doesn't make sense. I wouldn't rule it out. I wouldn't rule it out. I think we're actually now going to We never get over Freddie, but And it's time for a new leaf and fresh And John and I will definitely With or without Brian. That's up to him. I think I was reluctant to get back into opening those boxes It was tough to begin with. Roger made the first inroads, out of his studio Course that's the trigger I go: "No, no, no! "You got to do it like this, you know?" So my juices were working I had time to think, It was a monumental task. &lt;i&gt;Sort out&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the pieces of this supposed album,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the Freddie did, and various things&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;So it feels quite strange.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But we do still exist and,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;this is what we're doing&lt;/i&gt; this good. &lt;i&gt;Made in Heaven,&lt;/i&gt; The new song, which Brian happened to write and, gave me a tape. Said: "What do you think of the song?" And I actually forgot He put it away in a drawer And it was months later and said: "I just listened to the track and it's amazing It was very odd because it was the time and he listened to it and he could hear and he could also hear You could also hear it was about Gianni And he said: "I'm sure this is an important thing We are today trying to make a scene of You see these The band is featuring somebody on guitar. I forgot his name, but... What's his? See? Oh, so this right? Try to come into my nose and... The last shot Just so that we had it covered. And I was very keen you know, how you finally editor a video. Sometimes And we had a final shot all planned, but, but then we thought, well, which has been there all along And in the end, And then Rudi goes: "Cut!" And just before he goes: "Cut!", And I went, what was that? Did something happen? And everybody said: "No, I don't think anything happened." Anyway, we ran the thing back and you see and he sort of wheels around the glass Come on, kids! Look! &lt;i&gt;So, you got a new album out.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;New single out.&lt;/i&gt; Yes. It's been a long time, yeah. It wasn't like I was doing nothing else, mind you. I did a lot of projects during that time, which we really, I don't think I think it was time to move away again. I think it reminded me You know, I like being able And that's what this album is. &lt;i&gt;And the album is called&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;There's a story about this tree.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Yeah, yeah, I saw this tree in a magazine&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And I thought, I have to find that tree&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It looks like a woman, you know.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And the album was about another world,&lt;/i&gt; not being quite what they seem. &lt;i&gt;And this seemed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;So we went to the island where this tree&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;in the Canaries.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;You're very involved&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;when you take a picture,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But how long is. Wasn't that very tiring?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;You know, the funny thing is,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but that when we were doing the session,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;make the same shape&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And then I got really tired and went,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And luckily Richard clicked,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;maybe that's the one, you know.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And he did too.&lt;/i&gt; because I think to some extent, I think there are many people who see They think if this hadn't happened, I could have been doing this I could have been with this person. And I think it's something a lot of the time. It's secret thoughts. It's things we can't talk about him. And, so And I thought in the end that this is more in a strange way. So it became and it became the title of the album to. The can really can. Myself. Can you sing? Oh. So. Much. That someday you'll get my. Oh, man, I was gonna do my one and only. You know no one will ever know. I love you, no. Only you give me. Oh. Really? Thank you, thank you. They were gonna go one wonderful to be here in your beautiful Obviously, it's an honor and a privilege I got going out there. Okay. It's your birthday. Oh, hold on up here. Firefighter came over here One of the show, and they said, man, We can sell you a nice Porsche. I said, I got a Porsche. I sit on my porch every night, Oh, I hear you like a little rock here. Is that right? Oh, well, me a big rock. Always not lying you too much. present from the King himself, Elvis Costello. A lot of tales on album, which I wrote last night in the mail, guys. Well, Let's go. Come on, baby, let's, Come on, baby, no pressure. Hey, man. I. Why should we care? It's a good question. My view is a little different what you're talking about The only certainty in this world And as you say, populations come, populations go, I discovered this a little while ago. You know, people There is only change in nature animals is that every single animal matters. It's not just about populations, it's It's not about survival of a species. It's about one animal here like you, sir, who has feelings, who has dreams, To me... I regard it as a first principle that has feelings So it's really not about populations And it's not about balances. It's about caring about a soul. A person, an animal. Some of us, you know, A lot of us have cats and dogs, if something happens to them, you know? And yet we think it's fine for the only purpose of being killed. For food. A lot of us think it's okay to go out It's still goes on. And to me, this is inhuman. To me, this is the darker side of human We are human beings, and if we are given to be special, these feelings of of not caring. So why do I care? I think it's a first principle for me. It's a bit like Martin Luther King saying To me... I hold it self-evident is worthy of some respect. The most important thing in your life... Most important in life? Love. That's it. Oh. To you? Yes. It is. That was the in. And it was me. Who? Beep beep beep beep beep beep. Me me me. Oh!
