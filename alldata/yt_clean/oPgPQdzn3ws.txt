Welcome back, gentlemen! Today, we're exploring shaking up the hydroelectric power scene. Their modern design, is more affordable and economical you could have it humming along in a river in a week's time. Day or night, rain or Here's how it works: This smart turbine turning water flow into spinning energy. it can generate up to a whopping 70 kilowatts! And the best part? It's environmentally friends remain unharmed, and its impressive a step forward in renewable energy. OpenHydro. Continuing our journey into renewable energy, gentlemen, largest tidal power plant, off Canada's coast. weighing a thousand tons. This isn't just generating a staggering 16 megawatts of This marvel of engineering is the product of and it's been harnessing the power Now, get this: OPENHYDRO features two anchored by cables a solid 120 meters long. This tidal prowess, we can power about a thousand Landustrie. to meet the next game-changer: LANDUSTRIE. expertise in water management, turns canal height generating power from just a 1-meter of 500 liters per second. the LANDUSTRIE Screw Turbine is compact, with its low maintenance costs. It's resilient, ensuring the safety of our aquatic friends. kilowatts of electricity, continuously, and during periods of low water flow. Best Waterotor. to witness another trailblazer, WATEROTOR, a from slow-moving water bodies. canals, or even underwater ocean currents WATEROTOR has got it covered, generating anywhere Compact, portable, and eco-friendly, zero-emission solutions. You could fit bringing power to the most remote corners of Born from the genius minds at the WATEROTOR is not just a concept, but a proven providing backup for off-grid locations. Another Taum Sauk. Gentlemen, continuing our renewable energy expedition, we've and through the innovative waters of WATEROTOR. Missouri, home of TAUM SAUK, the world's largest Picture this: two reservoirs, one towering power demand surges, they release water down to the water's pumped back up, using surplus power Constructed in the 1960s, TAUM SAUK, started with 800 megawatts of power. Today, after As with all our stops, TAUM SAUK is a testament retaining up to 85% of the energy used to pump water back up. Another eco-friendly Luenerseewerk II. odyssey now takes us across the Atlantic, where the future is being forged. Gentlemen, the largest pumped-storage hydroelectric power Think back to our previous stop. harnessing the power of gravity. one perched at a staggering 1,800 meters, the capacity, all tucked neatly inside a mountain. promoting sustainability, and Scheduled to be completed in 2037, Lunenseerwerk sustainable future. Another intriguing pit-stop PB3 PowerBuoy. From Austria's Alps, let's shift our gaze to the vast Pacific Ocean off Ocean Power Technologies, is testing its latest that uses the kinetic energy of waves to generate Adaptable to depths from a shallow it provides uninterrupted electricity and can just about energy, it also transmits real-time remote marine-based equipment and the shore. is modular by design and adaptable Orbital O2. After marveling at the American innovation, let's cross the Orkney Islands. There resides the world's most the Scottish company, Orbital Marine Power. 24-story building and weighs despite its size, its environmental footprint is a tangible step away from fossil fuels. bidirectional operation, generating increasing its efficiency significantly. promises enough electricity annually for 2,000 light up our homes. Gents, isn't it amazing The WaveStar Machine. Sailing ahead in our journey, we encounter another fascinating piece of renewable a Danish company, Wavestar, this marvel harnesses Imagine a floating energy farm, tethered to and fall with the waves. This motion powers converting wave motion into usable electricity. promising scalability and adaptability power needs. This green machine emits no player in our renewable energy future. as tests continue not just in Norway, but also UniWave200. home to UniWave200, a revolutionary wave power of sea mammals, developed by Swell Energy. tall and 10 meters wide, utilizes wave chamber. This displacement drives a wind turbine, What sets UniWave200 apart? Its functionality is to numerous locations. Furthermore, for renewable energy generation. success could see a larger, more STREAM. Japan emerges an innovation in miniature with minimal water head, its compactness allows it plants, or conventional small waterways. to install, within two days, but Experts commend its reliability, keeping the output power ranging from 0.5 to 44 kilowatts. introduced in 2012, is already lighting up offers a promising clean, renewable energy Micro-Hydro Turbine System. energy journey, let's explore the power of turbine systems. These little warriors are perfect to light up remote communities, homes, They're adaptable, fitting seamlessly in diverse offering a cost-effective electricity maintain. Size varies, from producing a delivering electricity 24/7, with zero emissions. Gentlemen, we've journeyed through awe-inspiring each more promising than the last. cleanly is a victory for our planet.
