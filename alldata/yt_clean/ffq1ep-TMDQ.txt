I don't know how to answer that, considering I was forced into this relationship. If you love something, Peter set it free. I mean, f*** that. You lucky I ain't chaining his a** to the f***ing radiator. I don't know if going back to Texas is going to be the best thing for her speech therapy. This is a f***ing kid. The boat. He's a cheating little squirrely haired, little twat mouthed, motherf***ing face dick nose. What's wrong with her. What do you mean? She bought off her tongue or something. Don't laugh at that sh*t. Don't care? What's so f***ing funny back there? He's kicking your a** and talking sh*t at the same time. Sir. Whatever's between Walker and Lloyd. It's got nothing to do with me. Nothing to do with me either. That was just their excuse. I was the first one up every morning and the last to be done. Ask him. Ask him if anyone works harder than me. She ain't lying, sir. So the fight wasn't over you, huh? No, sir. You just did your job. Every day. Never fooled around with anyone in the bunkhouse. No one said that I couldn't. Common sense says you shouldn't because the next fight will be over you. So all that this is my home forever is just talk. F***ing scarred for life. It don't mean nothing. Right here. I want that f***ing bar. That f***ing bar right there. All these games are rigged. Who gives a sh*t, I want it. Why don't I just give you the $30 it's going to cost me to win the bear. Give me the bar. Come on. Huh? How you doing? Can you explain this game to me? All you got to do is. Toss three balls into the center hole. You can pick your prize. All right. That's delightful. You got that? You get it in the hole all the time at home. Just like home. Okay? There's kids around. Relax. You got this, baby. Come on, just throw it. F*** they just went in. That went in? Yes, sir. Right in. Okay, but nobody gets two in a row, so it doesn't really. Whatever you want. Step closer and get me my bottle of scope. Give me two more of those wipes. Right in. F*** ya. One more. That went in. Okay, wait. So if I get this, then I win. Yes, sir. Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Don't don't start trying now. Just throw it like you been throwing. Yeah, but I haven't even been looking. Then don't look. Right here, stupid. You just do that same thing again. Okay? You just look right here. F*** yeah, baby. Momma, momma gonna be so good with you. There's kids around. Give me my bar. Come on, man, you give me my f***ing bar. She wants the bear. Got it? I said! Give me that thing. All right. Just. I love my bar! Teeter. Yeah.
