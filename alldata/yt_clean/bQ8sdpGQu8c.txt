Welcome to Jeremy's IT Lab. This is a free, these videos, please subscribe to follow along a comment, and share the video to help spread help. In this we will be talking about 'subnetting'. not just for the test, it's an essential have trouble understanding subnetting, but is very simple if you take it step-by-step. , or maybe even 3 videos so we can take our getting lost. Now, because subnetting is such with it, there are already plenty of subnetting check out those videos too, there are some that can speed up the subnetting process. steps involved in subnetting, I will avoid over-complicating the topic. My end goal for these videos is that you understand So, what will we cover in this video? Only CIDR, which stands for classless inter-domain I introduced the IPv4 address classes, such that away and lets us be more flexible with cover the process of subnetting, taking it Now, before I get into CIDR, let's review understand the need for classLESS IPv4 addressing. A, B, C, D, and E. Class A addresses have of the bits can either be 0 or 1. This leads 0 to 127. Remember, an IPv4 address is 32 bits, in an IPv4 address. This makes the class Now, remember there are some special and reserved used for normal IP addresses on a device, of them in Class A. Class B addresses have other 6 bits can be either 0 or 1. This gives 191. The address range for class B is 128.0.0.0 have the first three bits set to 1 1 0, and that range in decimal that is 192 through through 223.255.255.255. Class D addresses a range of 224 through 239 for the first octet for class D is 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255. in binary, so the first octet range is 240 through 255.255.255.255. However, only the class A, B and C addresses as classes D and E have special purposes I A addresses have a /8 prefix length, meaning the other three octets are used for individual have a /16 prefix length, so the first two two octets identify individual hosts within length of /24, so the first three octets are last octet is used to identify individual The different prefix lengths give different see, there are few class A networks available, some are reserved, like the 127.0.0.0/8 range, addresses. Because only the first octet of ID, there are three whole octets available so there are 16 million, 777 thousand, 216 2 to the power of 24, because there are 3 addresses are different, there more class network, 65,536, which is still very many many class C networks, 2 million 97 thousand So, how does a company get their own network companies or organizations by a non-profit Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. The IANA based on their size. For example, a very large network, remember there are lots of available and class B network, while a small company are fewer addresses in each class C network, wasted IP addresses, so multiple methods of me give you an example of how this strict So, here are two routers. As you can see, Remember that routers are used to connect different Layer 3 networks, different IP networks. R2 each of these networks will have a few switches, connected to these switches. However, there connecting these two routers. This is known that its a network connecting two points, might be a connection between offices in different york. So, because this is a point-to-point network, let's use a class C network, 203.0.113.0/24. 256 addresses in the network. Minus 1 for for the broadcast address, 203.0.113.255, assign as 203.0.113.1, and minus 1 for R2's That's a total of 4 addresses used, and an ideal system. Before introducing CIDR, here's another company X, needs IP addressing for 5000 end does not provide enough addresses, so a class B network allows for about 65,000 addresses, wasted. When the Internet was first created, the creators as large as it is today. This resulted in you, and there are many more examples that includes over 4 billion addresses, and that IPv4 was created, but now address space exhaustion CIDR. The IETF (Internet Engineering Task the 'classful' addressing system. With CIDR, the requirements of 'class A B must use /16, and class C must use /24' to be split into smaller networks, allowing are called 'subnetworks' or 'subnets'. larger network into a smaller network so you Here's the same point-to-point network we the 203.0.113.0/24 network space, but that write this out in binary. Here's the binary, prefix length is /24, so here's the network Remember, all '1s' in the subnet mask is the network portion. In this case, I made is red. Well, how many host bits are there? 8, because many usable addresses are there? Well, the 2, equals 254 usable addresses. What is the 8 in this case. And why minus 2? Those are we can't assign them to a device so we have So, we have 254 usable addresses, but we only However, CIDR allows us to assign different Let's get some practice calculating the lengths. 203.0.113.0/25. 203.0.113.0/26, 203.0.113.0/27, put /31 and /32 in red because they're a try to calculate it. So, pause the video here are in each network...okay, let's check So, here is 203.0.113.0, but this time with of the address has extended into the first in dotted decimal is now written as 255.255.255.128. but it is part of the network portion, the blue from binary to dotted decimal, make sure you Now there are 7 bits in the host portion of is 2 to the power of 7, minus 2, which equals one for R1 and one for R2, so we will be wasting 252 addresses with a /24 prefix length, but How about a /26 prefix length? Notice that decimal, because two bits of the last octet there are 6 host bits, there are now 62 usable a /26 network mask for the 203.0.113.0 network, better, but we can make this network even Now that you get the idea, let's speed it as 255.255.255.224 in dotted decimal. There 30 usable addresses. As you can see, the address network mask. For a /28 prefix length, the mask is written are now only 4 host bits, so that means there to R1 and R2 this would mean only 12 wasted even smaller, to make our addressing even If we use a /29 prefix length, the mask is Now we have only 3 host bits, so that means after we give R1 and R2 addresses there would If we use a /30 prefix length, the mask is There are now only 2 host bits, so that means are 4 total addresses, that's the network address, R2's address. That means 0 wasted addresses! Before moving on to /31 and /32 let me clarify we will use 203.0.113.0/30, which is a subnet includes the address range of 203.0.113.0 in binary. Here is 203.0.113.0 in binary, 203.0.113.2, and 203.0.113.3. These are the the two usable addresses which are assigned this subnet, what about the other addresses addresses in the address block, which are 203.0.113.4 - 203.0.113.255, are now available to be used in other subnets! That's the and wasting 252 addresses, we can use /30 and way to make this even more efficient? Let's If we use a /31 prefix length, the mask is There is now only 1 host bit, so that means...0 minus 2 for the network and broadcast addresses, So, you used to not be able to use /31 network to point connection like this it actually it out. So here's the 203.0.113.0/31 network, R1 203.0.113.0/31 network consists of the addresses is actually only two addresses. Here they there's 203.0.113.1. Normally this would addresses after subtracting the network and networks like this, a dedicated connection no need for a network address or a broadcast case and assign the only two addresses in you try this configuration on a Cisco router, you to make sure that this is a point-to-point So, once again The remaining addresses in - 255 are now available to be saved even more addresses, using only 2 addresses People still do use /30 for point-to-point valid and more efficient than /30 so I recommend But we still haven't looked at the /32 mask. dotted decimal, making the entire address If you calculate this using our formula, you formula doesn't work in this case. You won't you will probably never use a /32 mask to are some uses for a /32 mask, for example to a network, but just to one specific host, host. Anyway, I'll talk about that later used at some points, but you don't have Here's a simple chart showing the dotted in CIDR notation. That's right, the way by the prefix length, like /25, /26, etc. with the CIDR system. Previously, only the I've showed you only how to subnet a class class B and class A networks as well, with I spent a lot of time on just that one subnetting, dividing a larger network into of using the whole 203.0.113.0/24 network use a /30 subnet and use only 4 addresses, 2 addresses. I'll give one more example In the next video I'll give you some practice can get some hands-on practice with subnetting. So, here's a scenario. There are 4 networks to each switch. There are 45 hosts per network, its address is included in the range. You and you must divide the network into four hosts required. First off, are there enough the first place? So, we need 45 hosts per network, network has a network and broadcast address, per subnet. 47 times 4 equals 188, so there's 192.168.1.0/24 is a class C network, so there 4 subnets to accommodate all hosts, no problem. Okay let's see how we can calculate the sized subnets with enough room for at least with a /30 mask, 255.255.255.252. I skipped point links, we can't use /31, and definitely the formula to determine the number of usable 2 to the power of 2 is 2 times 2, which is in a /30 network. Clearly not enough room How about if we use a /29 mask to make these subnets, can we fit so the formula is 2 to the power of 3 minus 2, which is 8. Therefore there are 6 usable How about if we use /28? There are 4 host minus 2. 2 to the power of 4 is 2 times 2 14 usable addresses, once again not enough for 45 hosts. How about /27? There are 5 host bits, so the the power of 5 is 2 times 2 times 2 times 30 usable addresses, again not enough How about a /26 subnet mask? There are now 6 of 6 minus 2. 2 to the power of 6 is 2 times 64. That means there are 62 usable addresses. doesn't provide enough address space. /26 go with /26. Unfortunately we can't always you want. There might be some unused address to have some room for growth anyway. So I think this video has gone on long enough. it this week's quiz. The first subnet (Subnet subnets? To help you out, here's a hint. Find the broadcast address of Subnet 1. The next address after that is the network address 3 and 4. Post your answers in the comment in the next video. So, what did we cover in this video? We covered removes the rules of class A, B and C networks addressing, according to the size of the network. but mostly just the basics. Hopefully you know a little bit about how to do it. I'll next video, but also feel free to ask any For today's video there won't be a practice subnetting. There will be flashcards, however, in this video.
