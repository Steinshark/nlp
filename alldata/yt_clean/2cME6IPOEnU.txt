The other team will be sent on a lavish and luxurious flight in Europe. Now, just because the flight is cheap doesn't mean the fun is also as cheap. To spice things up this time around, each member on both teams will be given an individual budget. Who knows? Could they spend it all as soon as they get there? Or will they be smart and - Oh, where's the PJ? - Not here.

What brother? What the Right, You ready? - And my only theory is and he wrote about the twist too early. And the twist is that when we get to Wizz Air, we're not on Wizz Air. I'm being f*cking Captain Cope again. - Oh, no. - I agree. I think we're about to. - I've been here too many times, Simon. - There's gonna be someone and it's gonna say &quot;head - Although British - Believe. - But you never get an optimistic Simon Take you.

It's It's an hour to Southampton. - It's about 45 minutes to Beacon hill. - Why would what, what, what, - Simon could be onto it. - Maybe like, he's like, look, but he's not with more expensive. - A private jet. - And he's gonna be on the jet - This was all to stall us. - He'll be on there naked - Why is he naked?
