If there could be a dream like project or a dream opportunity. Right? The reunion of or the collaboration between all of the artists that I've had the privilege to work with any of these things, have any of these things dead or alive? I mean, damn. Wow. I'm going to say both. If you could combine it. If you could pick your dream, your dream work. This is my dream work project. My dream work project attached to music. And this right here. Oh, my God. If I had the opportunity to do, what would that be for you, man? That's man. You should have started this mother****ing interview with that one. That's a great one. Yeah.

Who, who did you have the opportunity to work with? And he was like, No, I didn't. That you regret and that you should have worked with. But I don't want to throw your story off. No, but yeah, that's a good segway. Prince. Michael Jackson. You bowed out from working with them? Yeah. Both of. Them? Yeah. You didn't work with both Prince and Michael Jackson? Yeah. Was it like a demo tape or something? Nah, they just asked me to work with them and just like, What the f*** am I going to do with them? What? Yeah, that happened. What? Yeah. Was there, like. What the f*** am I going to do in the studio with them? Those are my f***ing heroes, man. You know you're doctor. Dre. Stop. You're doctor f***ing Dre. What do you mean? Most recently Stevie Wonder. So I'm working on an album with Marcia Ambrosia. Right? Ah she's so talented. She's amazing. And we did some music, a song using Stevie Wonder's music, and he had to clear it. And he called me up like, Yo, Jay. For some reason, Stevie Wonder calls you, like, super early in the morning. Like six, seven in the morning or some shit. I'm like this because you can't see the time like. The f***, right? So true story. It's like I don't like the lyrics. I don't like the lyrics. Right? Like, okay, we went in and changed the lyrics. He's like, What if we. Stop, Kevin. I don't want to. I don't want to elaborate on that shit. It's like just Stevie, Stevie, Stevie. It's 3 a.m.. What? Like, really? Is it like, what the f***? What the f*** is the difference? Like 5 a.m. and 5 p.m. to Stevie. All right, all right, all right. So this should happen. On the hell. Go, go! This shit happen. So he just called. He didn't like the lyrics, You know what I mean? Like lyrics. Then he called me back. He was like, okay, yeah, yeah. Dre, I like the lyrics. Why don't we get together and just write a song together? Yeah. Hi, Stevie. All right. And. Yeah, I didn't show up. She said, no, I just can't do it. What the f*** am I going to do in the studio with Stevie Wonder? I mean. I mean, touch the drums. No. Yeah. Touch the keyboard. No. Yeah. Yeah. What the f***? Yeah. Nah. You want to be able to give the best version, you know? Yeah, I went that way. But, Michael, you could have figured it out with Mike. Maybe. Nah, you know what it is? It's like, do that again, Mike. Imagine that. Imagine me to tell Michael Jackson. Nah, Mike, I didn't. I didn't. I didn't like that. We're going to need that. That second harmony one more time. You imagine that shit right now? Nah, that's not. Nah. I'm sorry, Mike. Are you singing that or what is that? No, that's not going to happen. I know. So, Mike, say f*** one time. But these. These mother******* are my heroes, man. It's like, what the f*** am I going to do in the studio with Stevie Wonder? Yeah. What the f***? When you. When you explain it, I understand it. I just thought that, like, you were like. No, I was curious. I'm definitely curious. I'm still curious, but, you know.
