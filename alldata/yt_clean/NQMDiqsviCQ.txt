Boss is a sushi chef with 65 years of experience. He will make sushi with careful handling. Shiitake mushrooms. Fried egg. A wooden mold is used to press the sushi. I'll push this. This wooden mold has been used for over 40 years. Let it sit like this for about 20 minutes. It's ginger tea. JKT) Thank you! I had ginger tea. thank you. A peaceful and pleasant morning. It seems that the two of them are preparing like this every morning. The conversation between the two is also a specialty of the shop. What? I don't know what you're talking about!

Remove the wooden mold of pressed sushi. Supple knife handling It's craftsmanship. The finished sushi is wrapped by the proprietress. I've been doing this job ever since I graduated from junior high school. I've never done it this way before. I'm 80 now. Born in Nagoya. The address is still in Nagoya. But it's better in the countryside. I prefer it here. It's a peaceful place. It's colorful and looks like art. Oh my God, it seems that there is a youtube of SABU. JKT) Is your dog a YouTuber? He is a YouTuber. Around 8 o'clock, the man who is doing it will come. He is making a video. It's a strange connection to that person. SABU is outside. He used to come see SABU every day. JKT) A fan of Sabu? Yes. He come here every day, so one day I said, &quot;Would you like to have lunch?&quot;. We had lunch together. After that, he works here. He is honest. he does well. JKT) The connection between people is wonderful. yes. The people here have a great atmosphere. Getting to know each other is natural. At this store, if I'm in trouble, someone will come out to help us. When I think &quot;I can't do it anymore&quot;, someone comes to help me. Even on Sabu's YouTube, when I said, &quot;Oh... sales aren't going well...&quot;, He came at that time. JKT) Does the shop been passed down from generation to generation? Or...? No, not for generations. After the chairman who started this place passed away, I was told, &quot;I can't do it without the chairman.&quot; But when the store was about to close, someone appeared to help me again. Thanks to everyone's help, we are here today. JKT) He is very sound asleep (laughs). SABU! Show me your face! But Your job is hard. You have to go here and there. JKT) me? JKT) I'm... well. I enjoy doing it (laughs). You can do it because you enjoy it. It's great to go to different places and meet people. JKT) Did you open the shop after you got married? oh yeah. After getting married, We started packed sushi shop. It was a prefabricated shop like this. Because there was no parking lot. If there is no parking lot, there are not many customers. When I was worried, I was introduced to this place. There was a butcher shop here, so I couldn't get a contract right away. That's why I started a business at the greengrocer over there. let's go. I'll show you (At that time) I was served sushi at a greengrocer. This is the sales floor. JKT) This is like this... (merchandise)? Is that so. The farmer brings the vegetables and arranges them here. JKT) Does it feel like a roadside station? oh yeah. The little one at the roadside station. I run the greengrocer here. This is also Miyako Shokudo's space. good morning! I'm going to go get some sugar. Both work well, though. There are many cats around Miyako Shokudo. Everyone was originally an abandoned cat or a stray cat. They know that the people here are kind. 6 o'clock. The boss took me to the market. JKT) How long does the market take? About 15 to 20 minutes. JKT) Do you go every day? I go every day. Even if I buy it or buy it. Arrive at the market. Go to the fish market first. Blue crab. Flathead. Many people have gathered since morning. The auction has started. I have no idea what they are saying The auction progresses steadily like this. Is he getting a good deal? Just when I thought that, He brought the fish. Today's best. that crab. It seems that the blue crab was auctioned off. JKT) How many cups do you have? the blue crab. I have 8 cups now. 3,000 to 4,000 yen. JKT) Huh? About 500 to 600 yen? Sometimes it's better. JKT) Eh! ? JKT) It's completely different! Next is the fruit and vegetable market. He pre-checks the vegetables of the day. The boss has his eye on the red perilla. He will also contact the market in advance. Such bargaining is said to be the real pleasure of the auction. The auction will start in 30 minutes. Can we make a good deal? &quot;Angels' Shohei Otani will play in the starting line-up for the Rangers game with the second DH.&quot; &quot;he kept the momentum of the previous day, which was a divine performance.&quot; &quot;He showed great success in today's game as well.&quot; JKT) Do you like Ohtani? That's right. JKT) He is amazing. amazing. JKT) Do you like baseball? No, I don't really like it. JKT) Isn't baseball like that? Do you like Ohtani? oh yeah. I'm actually a fan of the Chunichi Dragons, but they're too weak, so I stopped watching (laughs). The auction at the fruit and vegetable market will soon begin. The auction at the fruit and vegetable market has a relatively calm atmosphere. Boss seems to have gotten a good deal here as well. Boss loves to come to the market. The reason is that he can meet a lot of people. Interacting with people is one of the joys of working as a boss. Well, the red perilla auction is about to start. Too much! too cheap! A little too much! I will buy it! Only sell for 1200! It's like a comic dialogue or a conte. The boss will also negotiate. Take it! What a large amount of red shiso He got.

JKT) To sell at a vegetable shop? yes. I'll use half of it myself to pickle the umeboshi. My wife gets mad at me if I buy too much. Boss buys a lot when he feels good. The boss is sometimes scolded by the proprietress. Let's go home! I'm back at the shop. A customer has already arrived. She is a regular customer of the store.
