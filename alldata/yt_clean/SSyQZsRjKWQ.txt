She's gotta be close, right? Ten more minutes?! Okay, I'm just digging in. Oh yeah. So, what do you think?! This is the pic that inspired it. It took two hours to straighten it! And she was like, your hair's thick! But it turned out cute, right?! Something's not right here... Oh god, It's a giant hair!! That's not from my head, is it? I'm gonna be sick! IT'S EVERYWHERE!!!! You just had to swing that stuff around? Do you know how gross this is?! It was an accident... Gahh! I'm sorry, okay? There's only one thing left to do. Put that hair up in a pony. What'd you think I was gonna say? With a flip, this hair will be out of the way! Then flip it back around and pull it tight. And the rest gets tucked in here. Cute, right? It looks even better now! Now we just have to order another salad. Yikes! Is this thing alive or something? One more second and it would've bitten me! This test is harder than I thought! And more tiring! A party tonight? Ooh, Lily is NOT party-ready. What? Definitely not. But perhaps with a little help... Bella? What's happening? Where am I? It's makeover time, Lily! Let's start with your face. Did you dip it in pizza grease? Don't worry, I know just what to do. Let's get to it. Never underestimate a good contour. And, a freckle or two. What do you think of your new look? I almost forgot about your hair. Let's think. I got it! This messy bun's gotta go. I'm thinking braids! Start one just above the ear. And when you get about here, scrunch the hair upward. Pull it back a bit And secure it with a bobby. Now for the other side! Perfection! Is this an upgrade or what? Forgot about that test... How'd you do that? Now we have matching 'dos!! We'd better get going! Time to attempt the old at-home pedicure! You hang here while I prep my little tootsies. Think I'd look cute with curls? Only one way to find out, right? Here goes nothing! Oh god. It's stuck! My hair!!! It's so tangled! What's wrong with this thing?! Uh, do you mind? Girl doesn't know what she's doing. I suppose I could try another method. I'll put it up like this, Then wrap it around into a bun. Getting hard to hold onto here... There! Oh my god! AHHHH!!! What's on top of your head?! Just a bird's nest, that's all. Will she ever get it right? Maybe I can make some cute braids! How's it looking? I'm not just making a knot, am I? How does that even happen? GAHH!! HEY!! Can't a girl get a stupid pedicure around here?! Take that! It's not my fault! But I think I can turn this around! Put some hair to the side, and then over some toe separators. You can use it as a braid guide! It's way easier than free-handing it. Simply start outward and go in. Then keep going, and work down the strand. One more! And now for the tie! Go around a few times, making sure it's nice and tight. This is super cute! And just from this thing! See ya! Don't freak out... GAHHH!!!! Come on, just two more points! You winning, honey? You even there? HELLO? I see you. Why won't he talk to me?! What are you doing, Lily? Fine. I'll demand your attention then! Don't touch the hair. You and that hair. My hair ties! Time to take control! I didn't even pause the game!! I can't move my arms, Lily! Now that I have your undivided attention... I thought I'd give you a new do! Take some hair and twist it tight. It should naturally curl down like this. Then secure it, Now move onto another section of hair. Secure it the same way, Now get a good layer of hairspray on there. After it sits for a minute, Start taking the elastics out. Okay, last one! Oooh, it looks awesome! Aren't you so happy you have me? How'd you get so much volume? Lemme take a pic for Insta!
