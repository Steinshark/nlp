Hello, I'm erico! It's gotten really cold recently, hasn't it? This time, I'm going to show you how I decorated my home for Christmas. Decorating the tree, making an Advent calendar, and making salmon soup, I packed a lot of fun activities into these three days. Please relax and enjoy the video until the end! Before decorating the tree, I'm going to take care of my growing monstera plant. Haha. It's growing wide! I read that in the wild, it climbs trees, and if I put a pole in the middle, it will grow upwards, so I'm going to try that. I hope I'm doing it right. If I make it straight, it will grow too tall, so I'm trying to make it twist a little, but it's all trial and error. Haha. I'm sure it will be fine, so I'll tie the stem. Boy friend: &quot;Looks good!&quot; &quot;It's grown so much!&quot; Boy friend: &quot;It's gotten taller!&quot; I hope it continues to grow well...! Now, I'm going to get the Christmas tree out! Boy friend: &quot;This one's pretty big.&quot; &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;Got a lot of stuff in here!&quot; I bought the SKUBB storage boxes from IKEA, and they're really convenient for storing more than just the tree! Thank you so much to everyone who watched my IKEA Christmas haul video! I'm going to use the items I bought in my last video to decorate the tree! &quot;Alexa, play Christmas songs.&quot; Alexa: &quot;Playing Christmas songs&quot; With Christmas music in the background, I'm getting into the decorating spirit! Boy friend: &quot;How's this?&quot; &quot;How does it look?&quot; I've always wanted to decorate with a real tree, but when I was in Scandinavia recently, I learned that having a fir tree inside is a lot of work! &quot;When it's warm, the leaves fall off a lot.&quot; &quot;If you have it outside, it's fine,&quot; they told me, and now I'm even more in awe of it! Haha. Maybe someday if I live in a house with a big garden, I'll decorate with one. I used an IKEA tree last year too, and after coming back to Japan, I bought one again, and just like I heard, it seems to have definitely improved! It's easier to spread out the branches, and it looks fluffier. Now that the tree is done, I'm going to add the lights next. IKEA's STRALA lights are battery-operated, so they can be placed anywhere, even away from a power source, which is great. Last year, one light set felt a little lonely, so this year, I got two. Hmm, balancing them out is trickier than I thought. I'm going to start with my favorite ornament from IKEA this year! It's so elegant, and I just love the clear color and the shape; it's cute no matter how many times I look at it. Also, unlike last year, these need you to attach the string yourself! Well, I guess it just makes the process more fun! &quot;So cute!&quot; Boy friend: &quot;Looks good.&quot; Boy friend: &quot;When you add the ornaments, it really starts to feel like Christmas.&quot; I'll continue adding more ornaments just like this. For Christmas, I've been collecting little things from trips here and there. I'm going to make a video about my Finnish trip purchases soon, but here's a sneak peek...! These super cute ornaments I found at the Moomin shop in Finland. Wow, they're adorable! I'm trying to decide the best place to hang them. This ceramic brand ARABIA x Moomin series caught my eye right away, and it looks great on the tree. The colors aren't too bright, which I really like. Boy friend: &quot;What's this?&quot; &quot;Ornaments I brought from Australia.&quot; Boy friend: &quot;Oh, that's nostalgic!&quot; &quot;I want to add the wombat and kangaroo to the collection!&quot; The tree feels even more special with these ornaments, filled with memories from my travels. These are ornaments from last year's IKEA Christmas collection. I'm adding some bells and wooden ornaments I found at the Tokyo Flea Market. Finally, I'll add the star to the top... And it's done~!!! Just having the tree in the room really adds that Christmas feel! I'm going to brew some coffee with beans I bought when I went to Karuizawa. SHOZO CAFE has a great atmosphere, so if you find it in Karuizawa, Nasu, or Tokyo, I highly recommend it. I'll enjoy the coffee while finishing up the rest of the decorations. Do you also decorate for Christmas every year? I actually only started properly decorating last year. It's probably been since elementary school since I last decorated a tree! Since I'm a bit of a procrastinator, I always think it's a lot of work before starting, but once it's done, the time spent at home until Christmas is so much more fun. So I've decided to make it a habit to decorate by November every year! Haha. The days are getting shorter, so I want to make the time at home as cozy as possible. First, I'll make some boxes to put under the Christmas tree. I'm wrapping cardboard boxes and ornaments with cute wrapping paper. These are also from IKEA's Christmas series. IKEA really helps us. It might look like I'm wrapping these neatly while talking, but I haven't wrapped anything in a while, so I'm struggling a bit. Haha. Since it's just for us, I'm wrapping them loosely with whatever feels right. Hmm, I think it's okay? Normally, you can buy a tree skirt or a fence to hide the tree stand, but I couldn't find one I liked within my budget, so I decided to use boxes instead. I did the same thing last year, and it still gives a nice cozy vibe. What do you think? It's hiding the stand pretty well. Next, I'm going to make something I've been excited to create since I had the idea! I dried a swag I bought at the Tokyo Flea Market. I'm attaching it to driftwood and creating a base. Then, I'll write numbers 1-25 on little paper bags. Can anyone guess what I'm making? Yes, it's an Advent calendar! It's a calendar where you count down the days until Christmas, opening a gift or candy each day. Last year, I enjoyed a chocolate Advent calendar, but I thought it would be fun to make one ourselves, using things we like. So, I suggested it to him, and we decided to create one together! We set a budget and each buy 12 or 13 gifts, but we keep what we bought a secret from each other. And we wrap them in paper bags randomly. &quot;I have a feeling I know what kind of things you picked out...&quot; Boy friend: &quot;Really!?&quot; Boy friend: &quot;I think I put in some surprising items.&quot; Boy friend: &quot;This one's an apple mark.&quot; Boy friend: &quot;As long as I know what the mark is, it's fine.&quot; Boy friend: &quot;There's something with an apple mark.&quot; It was my idea, but thank you so much for having fun and doing it with me!!! &quot;Is it fun?&quot; Boy friend: &quot;Yeah!&quot; &quot;Me, too&quot; Most of the items are small candies or trinkets, but for heavier or larger ones, we're putting them under the tree with a mark on them. I'll put the same mark inside each paper bag with a date. Boy friend: &quot;What's that mark?&quot; &quot;Santa.&quot; Boy friend: &quot;Santa? I thought it was a bear?&quot; &quot;No, it's Santa.&quot; &quot;but it looked like a girl instead of Santa.&quot; &quot;This is the beard!&quot; Boy friend: &quot;It looks like a bear...&quot; Boy friend: &quot;That doesn't look like Santa though haha.&quot; &quot;This is Santa's hat.&quot; &quot;It's Santa!&quot; Boy friend: &quot;Looks like a dragon.&quot; It does kind of look like one...!? Since we don't have a lot of walls in the house, we decided to hang it on the stairs. Haha. I'll hang them one by one on the tree! Carefully trying not to touch the leaves, I'll add 25 bags, checking the balance... It's a bit tricky, but I'll keep going, and... It's done~!!! How's it look? It was a little difficult to prepare the materials, but it was so much fun making it together, and I'm excited that we'll keep enjoying it until Christmas. I can't wait for December to get here! Now, I'm finishing the last of the decorations for Christmas. I'll add a bit of Christmas cheer to the raised space. I found these starry lights at a Scandinavian home goods store and scattered them around, along with a &quot;aarikka&quot;s tree and tonttu I bought in Finland. So cute~!! So warm and soothing. I also added some beautiful books I bought that have lovely covers to bring a little bit of foreign Christmas into my bookshelf. The decorations are finished, so I'll make the flowers a little more festive, and tonight, I'm going to have an early Christmas dinner. I went with red, green, and a little white to give it a Christmas feel. After cutting the branches, there were a few leftovers. I thought about where I could put them and decided to decorate a small vase with them. The more I put effort into small spaces like this, the more I fall in love with them. Now, I'm going to make some salmon soup. This is another story from my trip to Finland last month, but the salmon soup there was truly amazing. Oh, I just remembered I have a Christmas apron, so I'll put it on. Haha. Christmas and Finland go hand in hand, and in Finland, salmon soup is a must. So, I'm going to try making it myself using a recipe! I hope it turns out well. &quot;It smells so good!&quot; &quot;Garlic always smells amazing when you use it!&quot; Recently, I've been thinking I'd like to expand my cooking repertoire, and since there's still about a month until Christmas, maybe I'll try some other Christmas dishes too! What are some dishes you love to make or eat around this time of year? Let me know in the comments! Wow~! It's so creamy and smells amazing. I'm letting it simmer. I'm doing a little table setting with paper napkins and placemats. It felt a little too red, so I added some berries. &quot;Christmas style.&quot; Boy friend: &quot;Your nails?&quot; &quot;Just a little winter-y.&quot; &quot;A little Christmas-inspired.&quot; Boy friend: &quot;Nice Christmas colors.&quot; Boy friend: &quot;Also, they're kind of Finland-inspired colors.&quot; &quot;Exactly.&quot; &quot;We thought it was very Nordic when we were doing them.&quot; &quot;Looks cute.&quot; &quot;And...&quot; Boy friend: &quot;Matches!&quot; Boy friend: &quot;These are cute Moomin matches.&quot; &quot;Moominpapa.&quot; &quot;So cute, he's just chilling.&quot; To finish the soup, I'll add dill. It has a refreshing scent. I hope it turns out delicious! And it's ready~! Somehow today's video turned out to be all about Finland and Marimekko. Haha. &quot;Cheers!&quot; You can already smell how delicious it is...! &quot;Mmm! It's so good!&quot; &quot;The dill really makes it!&quot; Boy friend: &quot;Dill's so good, it's amazing.&quot; Boy friend: &quot;The salmon is so tender and really delicious.&quot; &quot;The potatoes are soft too.&quot; Boy friend: &quot;This tastes just like Finland.&quot; &quot;The salmon soup in Finland was so good.&quot; Boy friend: &quot;But this is pretty close, right?&quot; &quot;Yeah, it's really close!&quot; &quot;It's almost as good as the one in Finland.&quot; Boy friend: &quot;The dill really makes it taste just like Finland.&quot; &quot;Dill is absolutely necessary.&quot; Boy friend: &quot;Wow, the salmon soup is even better than I imagined.&quot; &quot;It's so good!&quot; &quot;I wonder how much the allspice affects it?&quot; &quot;Allspice?&quot; Boy friend: &quot;Yeah, I think it adds a complexity to the flavor.&quot; &quot;If we didn't use it, it would probably be a lot simpler, like a consomme.&quot; &quot;Yeah, kind of like cream stew.&quot; The recipe is similar to cream stew and really simple, but it makes you feel like you're in Finland, and it feels really special. The holiday season I love has begun again. I'm so excited for all the Advent calendar openings and lighting candles, and even though it's cold and dark, I'm looking forward to it! Thank you for watching until the end! I hope you come back next week for another relaxing video\/-
