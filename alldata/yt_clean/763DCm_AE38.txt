Show of hands, how many of you heard the phrase growing up, &quot;You can be anything you want to be&quot;? Did you hear that? Yeah, what a crock that turned out to be. (audience laughing) I wanted to play in the NBA. Turns out, I'm short, I'm slow, and I can't jump! Not a good resume. But it wasn't about-- we're in middle school, and my best friend, I'll call him Allen, 'cause that was his name. And, (audience laughing) they said, &quot;You can be anything you want,&quot; and he's like, &quot;Dude, &quot;I want to be a model.&quot; But, like, dude . . . you're ugly. (audience laughing) You can't be whatever you want to be. I actually did an event with the NBA a few years ago, met Shaquille O'Neal. You guys know who Shaq is, right? And I literally--I walked away, started dying laughing. My buddy said, &quot;What's so funny?&quot; I said, what if they told Shaq that growing up? &quot;You can be anything you want to be.&quot; No, he can't! What if Shaq's dream in life is to be a professional horse jockey? (audience laughing) Imagine those horses. (screams) (audience laughing) And you start learning it through life. Like, I worked fast food as a teenager. Anybody else work fast food? (audience cheering) Yes, these are my people! Never give fast food workers a hard time! I don't care what you got, what happened. Don't give 'em a hard time! I was in line behind a guy the other day, and he's just, like, reaming the poor little girl, going, &quot;I said no pickles &quot;on the sandwich! &quot;You take it take it back! &quot;Don't just take the pickles off! &quot;You give me the sandwich!&quot; (gibberish) This girl's in tears, like, I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! I'm sorry! And she goes back there and I'm thinking, I didn't say it, but I wanted to go, &quot;Dude, you paid five bucks. &quot;You got food in a bag! &quot;Be happy.&quot; (audience laughing) But I didn't, because if you've ever worked fast food, you know this happened. I don't know what was on his sandwich when it went behind the counter. He's not gonna want what's on it when it comes back! I'm just sayin'. (audience laughing) And then I see jobs I could not do. They have road construction here in Provo? (audience laughing) That was a bit of a rhetorical question. They got guys in the neighborhoods that stand there with that sign, &quot;Stop.&quot; &quot;Slow.&quot; &quot;Stop.&quot; &quot;Slow.&quot; Now, these guys get paid really well, but I'm just telling you I could not do that job. With my personality, after about a half hour, I would start messing with people. (audience laughing) &quot;Stop. Slow. Stop! &quot;Slow. Stop! (audience laughing) &quot;Stop! (audience laughing) What really cracks me up is these guys wear hard hats. (audience laughing) Is that in case the sign falls off or something? That just makes me laugh! And then I got to thinking of other jobs I could not do. I flew out here from Atlanta, Georgia, and I flew to Salt Lake, and it was awesome, but I love flight attendants. I love them. I could not do that job. One flight of having to stand up at that door at the end of every flight. &quot;Okay, buh-bye. Okay, bye. &quot;Okay, buh-bye. Okay, bye! (audience laughing) &quot;Okay, bye. We'll see you later. &quot;Get off the plane! (audience laughing) &quot;There's one door! (audience laughing) &quot;Just leave!&quot; The part I really couldn't do is the part they're required by law to do at the beginning of every flight. &quot;To fasten your seatbelt, &quot;put this end into this end. (clicks tongue) &quot;To release, pull up on it.&quot; (audience laughing) I'm telling you, I would snap. (audience laughing) &quot;Direct your attention to Ken. &quot;He's gonna show you how &quot;to fasten your seatbelt.&quot; Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. To fasten! (audience laughing) To fasten! You know what? If we're in a crash and you can't figure this out . . . you deserve to die. (audience laughing) I'm sorry! (audience laughing) And if we lose cabin pressure and there's a bright yellow oxygen mask swinging in front of your face . . . (audience laughing) and you can't figure out &quot;breathe,&quot; maybe your DNA does not need to be passed on. I'm just sayin'. (audience laughing) And at the end of the flight, At the end of the flight, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, &quot;it's our final approach. &quot;Please put your tray tables &quot;and seat backs &quot;in the full and upright position.&quot; Why? (audience laughing) Really, why? This, okay . . . safe . . . unsafe. Safe. Unsafe. (audience laughing) Death, life, death . . . life. Really? (audience laughing) I've got a cousin who's a flight attendant. I said, What is up with the tray tables? And she said--I'm not making this up, she said, &quot;Well, in case &quot;of an emergency evacuation, &quot;we don't want anybody &quot;to get trapped.&quot; I would pay to see that. (audience laughing) &quot;Everybody evacuate immediately!&quot; Okay! My tray table's down! (audience laughing) Tray table! (breathing heavily) I'm trapped! (audience laughing) I couldn't do that job. Oh, I saw one job! One job, I've done this for over three decades. There's just one job in three decades that if I didn't do this, I would want to do. I was in Phoenix, Arizona. Buddy of mine picks me up in a convertible. I'm like, dude, this is awesome. I said, what do you do when it rains? He goes, &quot;It only rains twice a year.&quot; That night I do the show, I go back to the hotel, I turn on the TV. In Phoenix, Arizona, where it rains twice a year, they actually have a weatherman. (audience laughing) I would love that job! (audience laughing) &quot;Let's go to Kenn &quot;in the weather center.&quot; Okay, if you notice on the map here, you'll notice that we live in a desert! (audience laughing) I'm going on a limb here and say it's gonna be hot tomorrow! (audience laughing) Let's take a look at the five-month forecast! (audience laughing) Hot! Back to you. (audience laughing) Now, I don't know what you do for a living. Somebody tell me what you do for a living. Like, sir, what do you do for a living? - [Man] Teach. - You teach! Very good, very good. That's a great profession! I love teachers. My wife is a teacher. But you probably didn't dream of that. Like, you can be anything you want. &quot;I wanna teach!&quot; Hey! What's your name? - [Man] Steve. - Steve. Steve, you wanna go play baseball? &quot;No, let's . . . let's get some chalkboards and . . . (audience laughing) &quot;I'll show you how to do stuff. &quot;Let's do that instead.&quot; Probably didn't do that growing up. Now, I don't care what your job is. I had a moment when our daughter was little. She was a baby, she had a fever, and my wife said, &quot;Oh my goodness! &quot;Go get a thermometer.&quot; And we threw away all the baby stuff. &quot;Get a thermometer.&quot; I go to the store, I get it-- Now, if you've had a baby, you know it's a special thermometer. It's called a rectal thermometer. And I wanted to make sure I do this right. I read the instructions again 'cause it had been awhile. And I saw this on the instructions to the rectal thermometer. Now, I wanna say this. I want you to think about your worst day ever at work. Okay? Your worst day. And then, what I read on the bottom of this instructions. It said, &quot;Each thermometer &quot;has been individually tested.&quot; (audience laughing) Your job's not that bad. Okay? I'm just sayin'. (audience laughing) I see this poor guy coming home from work. (groaning) (audience laughing) &quot;Honey, come sit down!&quot; No! &quot;You look sad. What's wrong?&quot; Um. Next week, I gotta work overtime. (audience laughing) Oh my goodness. Life is confusing enough as it is. I used to think my dad-- my dad was an aeronautical engineer, brilliant man, but I used to think at times he was an idiot. Because, my mom would say something very simple, and he would stand there like a deer in headlights. My mom would say something like, &quot;Hey, we need to fix that drippy faucet.&quot; My dad would be . . . (audience laughing) See, I . . . Now I know what he was doing. I've been married almost 25 years. He was trying to figure out which &quot;we&quot; she was talking about! (audience laughing) Yes. Yes. My first year of marriage, my wife came in one day, and she goes, &quot;We need some new spring clothes.&quot; And I thought, I got plenty of shorts and T-shirts. Doesn't matter, 'cause that was a she-we. (audience laughing) This is gonna help some marriages tonight. I'm just telling you right now. (audience laughing) I was watching a ball game one week, and I'm sitting there, just a Saturday morning, watching the game. She comes in and announces, &quot;We need to cut the grass.&quot; And I actually had the mental thought, &quot;She's gonna help!&quot; (audience laughing) That was a me-we. (audience laughing) I'm telling you, 25 years of marriage, I'm still trying to figure it out. My two sons were home from college over the holidays. My wife makes an announcement. She goes, &quot;We need groceries!&quot; And I'm standing there just like my dad used to do! (audience laughing) My son said, &quot;What's wrong with dad?&quot; I said, Leave me alone! I don't know if it's a she-we, a me-we, or a we-we! I'm trying to figure it out (audience laughing) I'm telling you, that word can be confusing. When we were first married, some of our friends started to have kids, and the guys, the guys who come up say, &quot;Hey, we're pregnant.&quot; (audience chuckling) Okay. You look pregnant, but I don't think that's the way it works. (audience laughing) He goes, &quot;No, we're gonna &quot;have a baby.&quot; I'm thinking, no. No, you're not. She's gonna have a baby. You're just kind of along for the ride, right? And I've heard other guys that say, &quot;Well, you know they say that &quot;men passing a kidney stone &quot;three millimeters &quot;is the same as a woman giving birth.&quot; I don't think so. (audience laughing) Women having birth is like a woman passing a kidney stone the size of a human! Okay? (audience laughing) That's birth. (audience laughing) Oh, man. We, we, we. We're gonna do this. We're gonna do that. Now, we have children. Raise your hands if you have children, number of children that you have. Raise your hands. That's good. Two hands! All right! (audience laughing) We have four and it's amazing that we have-- I love this. My second son, when he was in middle school, last year, I got to coach him. We're driving to practice, and out of nowhere, he's like, &quot;Dad! Look, look, Dad!&quot; We're at a red light. Next to us is a brand new Maserati. I'm like, Dude, that is so cool. And he goes, &quot;Dad, do you think &quot;we could get one of those?&quot; I'm like . . . and it was a moment and it just kinda hit me, I thought, Yes! (audience laughing) You know what? I could have one of those. He's like, &quot;Really?&quot; And I'm like, yes! I said, I can have one paid for, and he's like, &quot;Really?&quot; And I said, Yes! I said, do you know why I don't? He said, &quot;Why?&quot; And I said, you! (audience laughing) And he said, &quot;Oh, man!&quot; And I said, no, dude. Not, &quot;Aw, man.&quot; You're way better than a Maserati. I wouldn't trade you for 10 Maseratis. You're incredible! I said, You don't poop in your pants anymore. (audience laughing) You can feed yourself. You're awesome and you're getting better! Now, I want to ask this. How many of you have had or have right now a teenage boy? Raise your hands real quick. Yes. You can understand this. I believe when you get pregnant, you should get a baby shower. When you get married, you should have a wedding shower. We need to add a shower. If you have teenage boys, you get a food shower. (audience applauding) It amazes me how these people eat! It's unbelievable. I was telling my buddy about it. I said, my boys drink a gallon of milk a day! He said, &quot;Ha, you ought to . . . &quot;ought to get a milking cow.&quot; (audience laughing) I said, yeah, we did. They killed it and ate it. (audience laughing) I think you should be able to register at Costco and they bring pallets of food into your house. I took my sons to a buffet restaurant. Buffet restaurant! They had three heaping plates of food! I'm like, that's amazing! I bring them home, I go to get the mail, I come in, my son is in front of the refrigerator. (audience laughing) What are you doing? He goes, &quot;I'm hungry!&quot; (audience laughing) I said, how is that possible? He goes, &quot;I don't know.&quot; Then I asked one of the dumbest questions ever. I said, Are you ever full? And he said, &quot;No, sir. &quot;But every now and then &quot;I get tired of chewing.&quot; (audience laughing) That's just amazing and they just, they eat and then . . . my youngest son's 13. I forgot about teenage boys. Teenage boys are a different level. It's just like their brains aren't catching up yet. I told him the other day. I said, hey, simple idea here. While you're in the shower, for an hour and a half . . . (audience laughing) Just at some point, won't you grab the soap? Okay? Just grab it. I said, I don't know how this works, but he went in, he smelled like our dogs. (audience laughing) He came out, he smelled like a wet dog! (audience laughing) Didn't smell any better. And it's just like, man, that's amazing. And I'm trying to get through to them, Just trying to get there. I'll tell you this, though. And I'm just going to ask this one. How many dads are here tonight? How many dads are here? All right. Bless your hearts, man. Hang in there. 'Cause I'll tell you, as dads, my least favorite phrase- my boys, as they've gotten older, my least favorite phrase is &quot;I might have.&quot; I might have. I'm driving my sons, my two older ones to school about five years ago. It's February. It's cold. I'm driving them and I hear out of the back seat, &quot;Uh-oh.&quot; (audience laughing) What do you mean, &quot;Uh-oh&quot;? He said, &quot;Um . . . &quot;I might have forgot something.&quot; (audience laughing) Now, before I tell you what it was, is there anybody over here, just a guess. February, school, cold. Anything he might have forgot? What do you think he might have forgotten? - [Audience Member] Coat! - Coat! Very good. He had on a hoodie, but it was okay. I'm like, that's it. Anybody over here want to take a wild guess? - [Audience Member] Shoes. - Who said shoes? (audience laughing) Do you know my son? (audience laughing) He said, &quot;I might &quot;have forgot my shoes.&quot; (audience laughing) I said, well, look on your feet! (audience laughing) Do you see anything on your feet? And he's like, &quot;No, sir.&quot; (audience laughing) At what point, do you walk outside across a cold concrete floor and not have the mental thought, &quot;There's nothing on my feet&quot;? (audience laughing) This is the same son, the same son that my wife came in about two weeks later, she said, &quot;Hey, hey, grab your shoes. &quot;We're going out to eat. &quot;I'm not cooking tonight.&quot; My son's standing in the living room like my dad and me. (audience laughing) I said, What are you doing? He goes . . . (mumbles) I said, did you hear your mother? Get your shoes. &quot;I don't know where they are.&quot; (audience laughing) I said, I'm gonna give you a hint. They're not on the ceiling! (audience laughing) Go get your shoes! &quot;I don't know where they are.&quot; I said, well, where did you put them? Now, this is a teenage boy looking. Most of you are gonna get this. He did not say a word with his mouth. He said it with his face. It was this. (audience laughing) Let me translate. &quot;Well, Yoda . . . &quot;If I knew where they were, &quot;I would get them!&quot; (audience laughing) I have a college education, and I am sucked into this conversation! (audience laughing) I asked the dumbest question known to man. I said, where's the last place you remember having them? (audience laughing) He said, &quot;On my feet.&quot; (audience laughing) This is the same son. His bedroom is in the basement. I went down there that February. I went down. It is so cold in our basement, I can see my breath. He is in a quilt cocoon. You can see his eyes . . . and finger tips . . . holding an Xbox controller. (audience laughing) And that's it. (audience laughing) I said, man, it's freezing down here! And out of the quilt, I hear, &quot;I know, right?&quot; (audience laughing) I said, why don't you turn the heat up? &quot;I don't know how.&quot; (audience laughing) I said, let me get this straight. You can operate 27 buttons simultaneously, (audience laughing) but that box on the wall with two buttons (audience laughing) in the shape of arrows . . . (audience laughing) that confuses you. (audience laughing) &quot;I know, right?&quot; (audience laughing) But I love this kid. He's amazing. He's in college now and he just makes me laugh. Out of nowhere, he just makes me-- just last Christmas he takes his girlfriend to a movie. He goes, &quot;Yeah, Dad. You-- &quot;You and Mom ought to go see it. &quot;But dad, can I ask you a question?&quot; I'm like, Yeah. He says, &quot;Do they ever &quot;treat you like a criminal &quot;when you go to the movies?&quot; I said, what did you do? (audience laughing) He said, &quot;Nothing, &quot;I just paid for the tickets, &quot;and she took my 20 and just went . . .&quot; (audience laughing) I said, dude, they do that randomly. He goes, &quot;You know what I did?&quot; I said, What did you do? He said, &quot;She gave me my change, &quot;and I went . . .&quot; (audience laughing) Isn't that awesome? (audience laughing) And I know it's confusing to kids, because they gotta go through, just all-- do you realize we live in a time with more choices than any other time of the history of the world? Do you realize that? If you doubt it, let me ask you a question. When's the last time you sat in front of a TV with a remote control . . . and went through 900 channels . . . and there was nothing on? (audience laughing) There's too many choices, and we're inventing new choices and solving problems nobody has. We're helping with questions nobody's asking. I'm driving on the interstate. Speed limit, 55. Speed limit's 70. That's my favorite. Have you ever seen the ones they put on the bottom about every 10th sign: minimum speed, 40 miles an hour. Have you seen them? Why? (audience laughing) Why do we need that choice? Are there people driving around going, &quot;Hey, man, you see any cops? &quot;I'm doing 35! Woo!&quot; (audience laughing) We're solving problems. This is one of my favorites. My kids every October mock me. &quot;Dad, here's your favorite candy. &quot;Ha ha ha ha ha.&quot; It's a tube of candy. It's been about 12 years now. Mini M&amp;Ms. Have you seen them? Yes. Why? (audience laughing) Why did we need that choice? Were people eating regularly M&amp;Ms, going, &quot;Oh, dang. &quot;I can't finish a whole one! (audience laughing) &quot;Just wish they would &quot;make 'em smaller. (audience laughing) &quot;I'll put that in some foil and &quot;eat the rest of that later.&quot; (audience laughing) Too many choices. And they're inventing new choices every day. And I guarantee you . . . I'll give you an example of why there's too many choices. Every person in here in the last 30 days, you have been in a car with a friend, a spouse, a loved one or a neighbor, and you have had this conversation around the evening time. &quot;So, &quot;where do you want to eat?&quot; I don't know. Where do you wanna eat? &quot;I don't care. What do you feel like?&quot; I don't know. What do you want? &quot;Doesn't matter to me? &quot;What do you want?&quot; How 'bout pizza? &quot;I don't want that.&quot; (audience laughing) I thought you said, &quot;It didn't matter! (audience laughing) Drive around for days. You finally get to a restaurant, there's more choices. Would you like a table or booth? Inside, outside? High top, low booth? (mumbling) Now, they try to get you into that choice-making mode. First question they ask is &quot;Would you like something to . . . - [Audience] Drink. - Drink. 'Cause everybody has a favorite drink. Dude, what's your favorite drink if you could have anything? - [Man] Root beer. - Root beer! Very good. What's your favorite drink? - [Woman] Dr. Pepper. - Dr. Pepper. What's yours? - [Woman] Water. - Water? That's your favorite drink? (audience laughing) Is that your wife? She's a wild one, isn't she? (audience laughing) Water! That's awesome! I bet you love vanilla ice cream too, don't you? (audience laughing) That's great! No, that's awesome! (audience laughing) I'm outside the South, but I gotta say my favorite drink--anybody here like sweet iced tea? Anybody else? A couple. See, now, I'm from the South. I'm out of my element because I'm like, sweet iced tea, I love sweet iced tea, and you can't get it. If you ask for sweet iced tea, they're like, &quot;Oh, it's not unsweet, &quot;but there's sugar . . . (audience laughing) &quot;on the table.&quot; I'm like, yeah, and there's a moon . . . in the sky. 'Cause if you drink sweet tea, you know sugar does not dissolve in cold tea. It's like a snow globe. You stir it up. (audience laughing) It's like drinking unsweet tea 'til that last sip. Whoa! Wow! (audience laughing) But I love it, so I started using sweeteners. I got the pink ones, and my one friend goes, &quot;Oh, you know, that causes cancer &quot;in lab rats.&quot; I'm like, do I look like a rodent to you? (audience laughing) So I started using the blue ones. He said, &quot;Oh, you know, &quot;that kills brain cells, &quot;'causes short-term memory loss.&quot; You know what I do now? I use one of each. (audience laughing) She said, &quot;Do you drink water?&quot; (audience laughing) That was awesome! I use one of each, and then if somebody starts to say something, I go, hey, if I get cancer, I don't wanna know about it. Okay? Just leave me alone. (audience laughing) But I think we have so many choices that we have lost common sense. I'll give you my favorite example. In Atlanta, we had a stadium called the Georgia Dome. A buddy of mine asked me to go and I'm like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; We had great seats in the Georgia Dome. We were in the fifth row from the roof. (audience laughing) Buddy of mine says, &quot;Which team are we?&quot; I said, we're the little silver red dots. (audience laughing) But as we went, got done with the game, they have those huge ramps that spiral down until you get to the bottom and you have vertigo. And then he grabbed my arm. He says, &quot;Hey, come here.&quot; I did not know about this, but on each end of the Georgia Dome, there's an express escalator. Goes from the top level all the way to the bottom. We get on that, you watch people spiral, and you're just going, &quot;Hey, this is great.&quot; The only problem was, halfway down, it's like 100, 150 yards long. It's massive. All of a sudden, just--(clunk) It broke. But then, we stood there. (audience laughing) I'm leaning over like, Why are we standing here? And I can't see, 'cause hundreds of people are leaning over going, &quot;Why are we just standing here?&quot; We stood there two and a half, almost three full minutes, stranded on this escalator. (audience laughing) I wish it was me, but finally this guy in the back just screams at hundreds of people, &quot;Walk! &quot;Just walk!&quot; (audience laughing) I wish I could've seen the guy in the front, &quot;Oh, dang. And I was almost there, too. (audience laughing) &quot;I hope they fix this soon. &quot;I gotta get home. (audience laughing) &quot;I'm gonna eat the rest of this M&amp;M.&quot; (audience laughing) (audience clapping) So, does anybody have a birthday in the past 12 months? (audience cheering) What are you guys, test tube babies? What happened there? As I'm getting older, I just realize my choices are narrowing down. Like, I didn't pick this hair. You get older, you don't get to pick as much. I didn't pick this hair. I used to have great hair. I mean, I had big hair. You guys remember back in the late '70s, early '80s? My hair was a hand high. It was huge! I loved it! If you took a picture of Buckwheat, I looked like the negative. (audience laughing) I love that half of you got that. (audience laughing) Everybody under 30's like, who is Buckwheat? (audience laughing) What is a negative? (audience laughing) No, but it's totally out of jealousy, because here's the deal. As my hair grows thinner and let's go-- ladies, let me just say this. How many, one more time. How here today are men that are married? Married men, raise your hands. Awesome. Every one of them will vouch for me. Ladies, this is out of jealousy, because it amazes us, stuns us, that how much hair you can lose, (audience laughing) and have any left on your head whatsoever. We take the second shower. We go to turn on the water. It's like, &quot;Holy cow! &quot;Is that a hamster? What is that?&quot; (audience laughing) There's a small toupee down in the drain! (audience laughing) I don't know about you, but I started picking it up, putting it on my bald spot. (audience laughing) It's not easy. My wife is catching up a little. She's five years younger, but she's catching up a little bit. The other night, we went to see a movie, and she gets up at the end of the movie, and she's like, &quot;Oh my back! &quot;Oh my back!&quot; I was like, Are you okay? She goes, &quot;Oh, my back, it hurts.&quot; I said, yeah, that happens to me sometimes. And she said, &quot;No, I mean, &quot;it really hurts.&quot; (audience laughing) I said, no, I know. I asked the doctor about it last time I went. She said, &quot;What did he say?&quot; Now, you gotta understand real quickly that my wife is a recovering hypochondriac. (audience laughing) And I am a comedian. (audience laughing) The straightest face I could pull, I said, Well, he told me it was the early stages of O-L-D. (audience laughing) I'm not making this up. She was like, &quot;Oh my goodness! &quot;What's that?&quot; (audience laughing) You're getting old there, Buttercup. That's what that is. Now, ladies, I do not know the female version of this, but gentlemen, when this happens, you are officially old. The other night, I pulled a muscle in my leg . . . sleeping! (audience laughing) Anybody else have this one yet? 3:00 in the morning, just, Oh, man! Oh! (audience laughing) I went to the bathroom, I looked like a newborn deer. (audience laughing) I shared that in the show the next week, this 20-something kid came up. He goes, &quot;Hey, man.&quot; I said, hey. He goes, &quot;Great show.&quot; I was like, thanks. He goes, &quot;You know what that is, right?&quot; I said, what are you talking about? He says, &quot;The cramp? &quot;You know what that is, right?&quot; I said, no. He said, &quot;You gotta hydrate. (audience laughing) &quot;Dehydrated. &quot;Before you go to bed, hydrate.&quot; (audience laughing) I said, dude, I just had a birthday. I hydrate before I go to bed, I'm peeing nine times that night, all right? (audience laughing) Yeah. I got a choice, cramps or Depends. (audience laughing) I'm sticking with the cramps for now. (audience laughing) It's not easy getting older. It's not easy getting older, but I love that I'm married. I have been married 25 years and it's been great. (audience cheering) Yes! You can clap for that, yes. (audience applauding) But my wife and I, we're getting in that mode where I'm so thankful what I've been through. And I look at the whole process, the whole process of relationships. And let me just tell you, if you're not married, it doesn't get easier, it gets harder, but it gets better. It's one of those weird . . . Like, in second grade, I don't know if you remember your first girlfriend or whatever. Second grade, I had seven girlfriends, at the same time! (audience laughing) It went downhill from there. I'm just saying. Now, I gotta ask this, and some of you are gonna remember this. Before smartphones, back in the day, when I get to middle school, I got my first love note. Does anybody else remember a love note? They never came from the girl, always her best friend. And it was always a rectangle with a &quot;pull here&quot; tab. Do you remember these? And you pull it, it was like . . . (poof) this message just appeared. It says, &quot;Dear Kenn, Mia likes you. &quot;Do you like her? &quot;Yes, no. &quot;Circle one.&quot; (audience laughing) It came with instructions! I loved it! (audience laughing) I circled yes, and I sent it back. I got another note . . . (poof) &quot;Dear Kenn, Mia wants you &quot;to ask her to go with her. &quot;Do you want to ask her to go with you? &quot;Yes. No. Circle one.&quot; (audience laughing) And I circled yes and I sent it back, and for two glorious weeks we went together. (audience laughing) I have no idea where we went, but we went together. (audience laughing) Then I got to high school. Only had two dates in all of high school, only two, but one was with a cheerleader. Now let me ask this. Any of you guys ever date a cheerleader at any point in your life? Raise your hands real quick. That's awesome. You can ask them to verify this. It's different. I went up to ring the doorbell, and she came up. I said, hey, are you ready? She's like, &quot;Ready? Okay!&quot; (audience laughing) I took her to see a movie. You take a cheerleader to see a movie, you gotta buy two extra seats, so you can sit like cheerleaders. In the middle of the movie, she's like, &quot;That was funny! &quot;Funny! &quot;Go!&quot; (audience laughing) What is this finger thing? And then I got to college. College, I discovered what was called, creatively, the talk. Now, the talk went something like this. I'll never forget the first time it happened. We were at Shoney's. Do you guys even know what a Shoney's is? (audience member whistles) Yes! Nice! It's like a Denny's, just not as nice, okay? That's Shoney's. And I'm sitting there with my hot fudge cake, and this girl goes, &quot;Um . . . &quot;can we talk?&quot; I'm like, Yeah. That's what we're here for. (audience laughing) She said, &quot;Uh . . . &quot;Where . . . &quot;where are we?&quot; (audience laughing) (audience laughing) Shoney's. (audience laughing) Not at Shoney's . . . And then she said this, &quot;You know, Kenn, &quot;you're so great and wonderful. &quot;You're everything &quot;I've ever looked for in a guy. &quot;That's why I think you'll make &quot;such a great husband and father, &quot;but that's why I think &quot;we should date other people. (audience laughing) &quot;But let's still be . . . &quot; - [Audience Members] Friends. - Oh, you know the talk. That's great! That's great. And then I got out of college, met my wife, and I love this. I was in my groom's room at my wedding. And a buddy of mine goes, &quot;Man, they should warn you &quot;when you get married.&quot; I said, what are you talking about? He says, &quot;They should warn you. &quot;In the vows, they should &quot;change 'em to warn you.&quot; And I'm like, dude, I'm about to walk out and get married, what are you talking about? He says, &quot;Well, &quot;they should change the vows. &quot;To her, they need to be the same: &quot;Do you take him better &quot;or worse, rich or poor, &quot;sickness, health, &quot;death do you part? I do. &quot;To men, they need to read &quot;some version of Miranda rights. (audience laughing) &quot;You have the right to remain silent, (audience laughing) &quot;'cause anything you say &quot;can will be misunderstood, (audience laughing) &quot;and it will be used against you.&quot; (audience laughing) I love being around young couples. Anybody here tonight, like, newlyweds, a year or less? Anybody newlyweds? And they're like, we're not admitting. Are you really? That's awesome. That's great. And I love being around them, because they're so great. Let me just tell you. Dude, have you heard this one yet? &quot;Are you gonna wear that?&quot; Have you heard that yet? You have? Let me give you a quick hint. That's not a question. (audience laughing) That's a statement in the form of a question. The next time she does it, I've got the answer. You just go, This? No, no! This is my warm-up outfit. (audience laughing) I was waiting for you to pick something out for me. We were sitting next to some newlyweds in the restaurant the other night. My wife said, &quot;Hey, &quot;get me a Coke Zero. &quot;I'm going to the bathroom.&quot; And I wasn't eavesdropping. They were just right there. And it was so great, because I just thought, You know what? I need to be more attentive to my wife. He's super attentive. And he just went, &quot;What's wrong?&quot; And of course, ladies, she said . . . - [Women] Nothing. - Nothing. But, see, he didn't know. He was a rookie, and . . . (audience laughing) And he said, &quot;Well, &quot;I can tell something's wrong. &quot;Why don't you just tell me?&quot; And she goes, &quot;You wouldn't understand.&quot; He goes, &quot;Well, how can I understand &quot;if you don't tell me?&quot; And finally, she just broke down. She goes, &quot;I just . . . &quot;I just want you to want what I want!&quot; (audience laughing) I wanted so bad to lean over and go, It's a trap! (audience laughing) Don't say anything! But he didn't know. And he said, &quot;Well, what do you want?&quot; And I thought she was about to burst in tears. She goes, &quot;See, you don't understand!&quot; And I thought his head was gonna explode. He goes . . . And it could not have been more perfect timing. The waiter came at that moment to their table and said, &quot;Hey, are you guys &quot;ready to order? &quot;Do you know what you want?&quot; (audience laughing) I just love that. And I'm not saying if you're sitting here at night and you're single. Any singles? Let me see singles' hands. Let me see hands. All right. There's some singles here. That's great. It's not easy being single. It's not. I'm telling you, though, the married folks love watching you people. We really do. (audience laughing) Now, this is worth the whole price of admission here tonight. Guys, you will never know if girls are checking you out. 'Cause girls at a young age begin to travel in herds. (audience laughing) And they're sneaky about it. You walked in, and they're like, &quot;Oh my gosh, do you see him? &quot;Don't look now! Don't look now! &quot;No, look at the reflection &quot;off the wall. Okay? &quot;Follow my finger, &quot;follow my finger, follow my finger.&quot; (audience laughing) You will never know. Ladies, inversely, God, in his wisdom in creation, reached down into the male DNA and pulled out the gene called discretion. (audience laughing) You will never have to wonder if a guy is checking you out. You walk by, and guys are like, &quot;Hiiiiiii . . . &quot; (audience laughing) That's not the best part. The best part is, if you catch a guy looking, thousands of years, guys checking out girls, we're staring, here's what we came up with. You walk by. (grunt) You catch us looking. Here's what we do. &quot;Hey!&quot; (audience laughing) We're like a low Pez dispenser. (audience laughing) Oh my goodness, this is again gonna be worth it. If you're single, this one alone is worth-- my wife and I, 10-year anniversary, we went to Hawaii. I learned a word in Hawaii, aloha. Do you know what that word means? It means . . . - [Audience Member] Hello. - Hello and . . . - [Audience Members] Goodbye. - And do you know what else it means? - [Audience Member] I love you. - I love you. Yes. That's it! Talk about the perfect word for the end of a first date! (audience laughing) &quot;Aloha! &quot;You figure it out.&quot; (audience laughing) Isn't that great? (audience laughing) I'm telling you, it's not gonna get easier, but it is gonna get better. I love my wife. We found out how different we are, but we've even gotten past that. I'm OCD. Drives her crazy. It really does. She's like, &quot;You are so OCD!&quot; and I am. My clothes in my closet. Short sleeves, lightest to darkest. Long sleeves, lightness to darkest. Pants, lightest to darkest. Everything has a drawer, everything in its drawer, as God meant it to be, okay? (audience laughing) Anybody else here OCD? Anybody else? Yes! These are my people. And I love it. She's raising her husband's hand. &quot;You! You!&quot; (audience laughing) Well, if I'm OCD, my wife has a condition I have submitted to the New England Journal of Medicine. It's called G-I-L-D. Get It Later Disorder. I'll give you the perfect example of G-I-L-D. I went to the bathroom the other night. I had . . . hydrated too much. (audience laughing) I know where the bathroom is, and as I'm walking to the toilet, I did not realize she has left the drawers to her sink open. In the dark, I'm just . . . (thump) (audience laughing) (groans) Got a gash in my leg. Next morning, she's like, &quot;What was that noise?&quot; (audience laughing) I said, baby, you left your drawers open. And if you're married to somebody with G-I-L-D, here is the phrase you will hear repetitively. She said, &quot;I didn't have time. &quot;I was in a hurry. I didn't have time.&quot; You didn't have time to push in your drawers? (audience laughing) You got a stopwatch on your iPhone. Time this. Ready? Go. How long was that? (audience laughing) You didn't have time? A couple of weeks later, had a scratchy throat. Went downstairs to get a drink of water. I know where the cabinet is. Leaned in to get a drink to open the door to get a glass. Didn't need to. It was already open. I just lean in. (slam) (audience laughing) God! Got my drink, went back to bed. The next morning . . . I wake up to the most blood curdling scream I have heard in my marriage. Had a noise like . . . (shrieks) I'm like, whoa, what? What? I'm like, What? And she said, &quot;What happened to you?&quot; And I'm like, What are you talking about? I looked down. I am laying in a pool of blood. (audience laughing) There is a goose egg on my forehead with a gash down the middle. Blood all the way down one side. (audience laughing) She said, &quot;What happened to you?&quot; And I was like, baby, you left the cabinet door op-- I said, op-- And she goes, &quot;I didn't have time! (audience laughing) &quot;I was in a hurry! I didn't have time!&quot; And she goes, &quot;I just . . . &quot;I feel like I frustrate you. &quot;I just feel like I frustrate you.&quot; And I was like, baby, baby, you . . . You do. (audience laughing) You frustrate the crud out of me sometimes. Baby, here's the deal. It's like 2% of the time. See, when you're married, for a while, you realize we're not perfect, we weren't meant to be perfect. She goes, &quot;Well, you frustrate me too.&quot; And I was like, baby, I know. I'm OCD. But you gotta look at the bright side of OCD. Baby, if I'm in the kitchen walking through and there's dishes, I have to do them. (audience laughing) That's the way I'm wired. Ladies, I have vacuumed without being asked, all right? (women cheering) I know. Don't be impressed like that. I just liked the way the lines look. (audience laughing) You can ask my wife this. Go online and see, meet her and ask her, 'cause at my house, I wash, soften, dry, fold and iron all the laundry in our home, okay? Now, I'm getting some death looks from some guys right now. (audience laughing) You gotta understand, I'm aware. I'm self-aware that I am below-average looking, okay? (audience laughing) But I'm gonna tell you right now, for most of the women over 35, I just became one of the sexiest men alive, all right? I'm just saying. (audience laughing) I shared that at a show, women were throwing clothes on the stage. (audience laughing) I don't think they were attracted. I think they were like, &quot;Wash this! &quot;Iron this!&quot; (audience laughing) You're good. But see, here's the deal. I want to get better. And as I get better, I've made a choice. I remember now . . . if you've been married for more than five years, you've learned to discern your wife's screams. (audience laughing) There's the &quot;I am in mortal danger&quot; scream. But it sounds very similar to the &quot;I'm completely overreacting&quot; scream. (audience laughing) 5:17 in the morning, I heard the overreacting scream, and I have a choice. Do I pretend I did not hear that? (audience laughing) And then she screamed again. Now I gotta do something. I go into the bathroom. I open the doors. My wife is on the sink. Towel half around her, bath robe half around her. She sees me and just starts to scream. &quot;It was over there! It was huge! &quot;It was this big! It was rat or a roach! &quot;I don't know what it is!&quot; (screaming indistinctly) Okay, okay. I'm trying to wake up. I'm like, okay . . . it was this big? And she goes, &quot;It was this big!&quot; And I was like, Okay, that's a cat. All right? (audience laughing) But I'll look. I'll go. And I look. And I'm like, Are you sure it wasn't, like, your hair in the drain or something? (audience laughing) I said, baby, it's gone. And she goes, &quot;Are you sure?&quot; I said, yes. But I want to validate her. I said, I will get traps. I put the traps throughout the house. The next morning, I woke up. Right before her alarm. I had to go to the bathroom. I hydrated the night before. And I want to be a good husband. I pick up the toilet seat. As I go to pick it up, I see something I have never seen before. It was a mouse floating in our toilet. Now, when I say floating, I don't mean like in a chair with a drink and an umbrella. (audience laughing) It was more like a mob hit. Just . . . (audience laughing) Just that time, she walks up. I said, did you put him there?&quot; She just flipped out. She's like, &quot;That's him, &quot;that's him, that's him! &quot;What is he doing? What is he doing?&quot; I'm like, floating, pretty much. (audience laughing) She said, &quot;What? Why is he in there?&quot; I'm like, I don't know. You know what? I think he heard you scream yesterday. Couldn't live with the guilt. Ended it all. (audience laughing) She said, &quot;Do you think &quot;there's any more?&quot; I'm like, I don't know, but I put out the traps. That night, three seconds after my head hit the pillow . . . (pop) I said, what? She's like, &quot;What was that?&quot; I'm like, I don't know, but I will go look. (audience laughing) Why are we whispering? (audience laughing) I go into the closet. I open the door to our crawlspace, flip on the light, and sure enough, there's his brother. I'm like, Ooh! I mean, right in the middle. And I'm like, I'm not gonna traumatize her. I'll get him tomorrow. I turn off the light, I close the door. As I'm walking back to bed, she's like, &quot;Was there another one?&quot; I'm not gonna lie. I said, Yes. She said, &quot;What did he look like?&quot; (audience laughing) I said, you know what, I can tell you exactly what he looked like. He looked like, &quot;Oh, look, peanut butter!&quot; (audience laughing) I'm gonna tell you this. I give myself a B, maybe a B- on that, but I want to get better. And I'm gonna get better. And here's what I came up with. I believe this was divinely inspired. This year, I'm going to match her level of emotion . . . in every situation. (audience laughing) Next time I hear that scream, I'm bursting through the doors. My lady! (audience laughing) I have heard your cry! (audience laughing) Your prince is here! For what vexes thee? For if it vexes thee, it vexes me, for our hearts are one. (audience laughing) Then I shall hunt down this rat-roach beast of crawl space! And I shall end this reign of fear in our castle! (audience laughing) Then we will return to the marriage chamber. (audience laughing) And we will lie on the wedding bed. And we will do what lovers of 20 years do. We will bask in the glow of our . . . television. (audience laughing) For at least eight minutes before falling asleep. (audience laughing) But sleep does not end our love. No, our love is enriched in slumber. For even as we sleep, you harken unto me. (snoring) (audience laughing) And I beckon back. (snoring) And when we awake, and sleep's journey is complete, and slumber is no more . . . our lips like magnets are drawn. And as they touch ever so gently, we realize simultaneously that we share the breath of a dead camel. (audience laughing) And we return to the room where the rat-roach beast once ruled. And we brush our teeth. As we brush, I see your reflection in the pools of brown that are your eyes. And they speak to me and they say . . . &quot;I married that.&quot; (audience laughing) And I see you in all of your . . . naturalness. (audience laughing) And it is then that we realize, this is true love! God bless you. Thank you guys tonight! (audience cheering)
