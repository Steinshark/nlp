John! John! You know, his service record was unimpeachable. But he's not responding to orders and he's setting these things loose. We created him. So we're responsible when we can't control him. When he recruits others to join him. The only thing worse than losing a hero is watching him turn against us. The official story is the master chief is dead. You, Spartan Locke, are the unofficial story. Your mission, is go! As I suspected, nothing but a man. Red team leader, this is Recon one. You have multiple hostiles approaching your location. Alice, leaving. Yes. Run, little demon. Command, this is red team. We have a Spartan casualty. Hunt them down. Immediate evac requested. Find out where they came from. Douglas, stay with me. And bring me back anything... Douglas! ...useful! Come on! Come on! Do we have a plan? We do. Your own spirit of fire action. Covenant here. Status? Sir, requesting danger close on our location. Trailing north, 5 seconds. Interesting device. Understood. Departure missiles in bounds. Alice is in R.A. She'll stay silent down there until she has a good shot at getting back to us. Sir. Isabelle, this is Captain Cutter. I know who you are. James Cutter, captain of the spirit of fire. We're supposed to be lost with all hands. Not so lost, it seems. What happened down there? I need to know what we're up against. Isabel? Isabel, report. Sir. Five months ago, the portal from the ark to earth shut down without warning. A month later, he arrived. He? The brute, their leader. His name is Atriox. During the war, the Covenant used his clan as expendable muscle. Told them dying in battle would speed their holy journey. 40 at a time, they carelessly sent them in. 40 to break the front lines. 40 to die for beliefs not their own. And never returned until he did. And so, battle by battle, war by war, 39 brothers at a time. Atriox was born. With every victory, his legend and his hatred of the Covenant grew. Eventually, both were impossible to conceal. And they tried to banish him. And everything we know about the Covenant's thousand year history. Atriox was the first to defy the Covenant and survive. And his defiance inspired others. Atriox and his banished raided Covenant resources, cutting a swath across the galaxy, growing in strength with each attack, gathering killers and mercenaries to his side. The Covenant had two targets in those years. Humanity and Atriox, they almost got us. But Atriox, they never came close. The whole damn Covenant couldn't contain him at the height of their power. Isabelle. It's done. Time to go home. Whoa! You've been busy. Not as busy as you. The grav lift. What do we do? You. You, hold on. Wait. What? Wait, wait, wait! One Spartan. Yes. And the AI? We still don't know how she accessed. How many of your men survived? Enough to honor our contract. But, how? Get everyone you can on the green. Take it from the humans. Prove you are still worth your price. Professor. It's now or never. Show us what you got. Captain. It's done. Professor Anders. We are on our way. Get to the rendezvous. With all due respect, Spartan. I don't believe that's an option any longer. Professor Anders, there must be some way. Don't worry, captain! As soon as I'm back to the soil system, I'll get that beat out. It should only be a few weeks. Professor! If I can figure out how to get back to you. Captain? The other teams are clear? Yes, sir. ETA to the spirit of fire is five minutes. Bring up the map. We have a lot of work to do until she gets back. I kept it. What's happening? Why did we drop out of slip space? Good job, Alan. We may have been safer on the ark. Do not disobey your orders again. Scout the shell. Salvage the ships. That is it. Atriox was clear. I'll look around. And if we find prizes to bring back? How could that go wrong? Voridas, listen. You fail him one more time trying to prove yourself, and I will not be able to save you. And it will be both our skulls beneath his mace. Relax, brother. You worry too much. Prepare yourselves. I told you not to go inside. For good reason. Secure the breach. Clean up your mass. I will be waiting for you. When you are done. Tell me about the children. Doctor Halsey. You already know everything. You kidnap them. Children's minds are more easily accepting of indoctrination. Their bodies more adaptable to augmentation. The result was the ultimate soldier. And because of our success, when the Covenant invaded, we were ready. Doctor Halsey, you're bending history for your own favor and you know it. You developed the Spartans to crush human rebellion. Not to fight the Covenant. In one human world after another fell. When my Spartans were all that stood between humanity and extinction, nobody was concerned about why they were originally built. So you feel in the end, your choices were justified? My work saved the human race. Do you think the Spartans lack of basic humanity helped? What are you after? The others before you were naval intelligence. But you, you're something else. Records show Spartans routinely exhibited mildly sociopathic tendencies, difficulty with socialization and fervent. The records show efficient behavior operating in hazardous situations. I supplied the tools to maintain that efficiency. Do you believe the master chief succeeded because he was, at his core, broken? What does John have to do with this? You want to replace him? The master chief is dead. His file, Reeves. Missing in action. Catherine, Spartans never die. Your mistake is seeing Spartans as military hardware. My Spartans are humanity's next step. Our destiny as a species. Do not underestimate them. But most of all, do not underestimate him. I do not trust you. He may, but I do not . No. My friends. Trust is not the issue today, Spottenlock. It is my trust. You must confess. Arbiter. You are a hunter. Yes? A seeker of things. That's not the official job title, but it's close enough. And now you hunt other Spartans. I'm not so much hunting a Spartan, as I'm hunting the Spartan. You seek. One, one, seven. I was not told the identity of your brain. That is why I'm sharing it with you now. We're talking about trust after all. May I ask you something? Your people used to call him demon. Was that an insult or a compliment? An insult, to be sure. But one with a modicum of respect. He was indeed my enemy. But in time, I named him ally. Even friend. The events which forged this bond were culpability. There was only one chief. One? Are you sure? Yes. They called it the pillar of autumn. Why was it not destroyed with the rest of their fleet? It fled as we set fire to their planet. But I followed with all the ships in my command. When you first saw Halo. Were you blinded by its majesty? Blinded? Paralyzed? dumbstruck? No. Yet the humans were able to evade your ships. Land on the sacred ring and desecrate it with their filthy footsteps. Noble hierarchs, surely you understand that once the parasite attacked. There will be order in this council. You were right to focus your attention on the flood. But this demon, this master chief. By the time I learned the demon's intent. There was nothing I could do. Noble prophet of truth, this has gone on long enough. Make an example of this, Bungler. The council demands it. You are one of our most treasured instruments. Long have you led your fleet with honor and distinction. But your inability to safeguard Halo was a colossal failure. I will continue my campaign against the humans. No, you will not. Soon the great journey shall begin. But when it does, the weight of your heresy will stay your feet and you shall be left behind. The plating was about to fail. There's viscosity throughout the gel layer. Optics, totally fried. And let's not even talk about the power supply. You know how expensive this gear is, son? Tell that to the Covenant. You told me there wouldn't be any cameras. And you told me you were gonna wear something nice. Folks need heroes, chief. To give him hope. So smile. What's up? Well, we still got something to smile about. Drawn quite a crowd. If they came to hear me big, they will be disappointed. Are you sure? Gentlemen, we're lucky to have you back. Go ahead, Cortana. Another whisper. Sir, near IO. We have probes en route. I apologize, but we're going to have to make this quick. You look nice. Thank you, sergeant major. The Colonial Cross is awarded for acts of singular daring and devotion. For a soldier of the United Earth Space Corps. There can be no greater heresy. Let him be an example for all who would break our covenant. Commander Miranda Keyes. Your father's actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of military service. His bravery in the face of impossible odds reflects great credit upon himself and the UNSC. The Navy has lost one of its best slip space ruptures directly off our battle cluster. Show me. 15 Covenant capital ships holding position just outside the kill zone. This is Fleet Admiral Harper. We are engaging the enemy. Negative, admiral. Form a defensive perimeter around the cluster. Commander, get to your ship. Link up with the fleet. Yes, sir. You have the mech gun, Cortana. As soon as they come in range, open up. Gladly. Something's not right. The fleet that destroyed reach was 50 times this size, sir. Additional contacts? Boarding craft, and lots of them. They're going to try to take our Mac guns offline, give their capital ships a straight shot at Earth. Master Chief, defend this station. Yes, sir. I need a weapon. Right this way. Me inside your head now. How much time was left? You don't want to know. Cairo, this is an amber clad. The carrier shield is down. I'm in position and ready for immediate assault. Negative, commander. Not against a ship that size. Not on your own. Sir, permission to leave the station. For what purpose, Master chief? To give the Covenant back their bomb. Permission granted. I know what you're thinking, and it's crazy. So stay here. Unfortunately for us both, I like crazy. Just one question. What if you miss? I won't. For a brick, he flew pretty good. Chief. Get inside. Gear up. We're taking this fight to the surface. The message just repeats. Regret. Regret. Regrethe catchy. Any idea what it means? Dear humanity, we regret being alien bastards, we regret coming to Earth. And we most definitely regret the core just blew up our raggedy ass fleet. Hoorah. Regret is a name, sergeant. The name of one of the covenant's religious leaders. A prophet. He's on that carrier and he's calling for help. Grid Kilo 23 is hot. Recommend mission abort. Roger Recon. It's your call. Sarge. We're going in. Get tactical, marines. Master Chief, get aboard that carrier. Secure the prophet of regret. This is the only place on Earth the covenant decided to land. That prophet is going to tell us why. Whoa. Rockets didn't do anything. Where's the rest of your platoon? Wasted, sarge. And we will be, too, sir, if we don't get the hell out of here. You hit Lorraine? No, sir. Then listen up. Usually, the good lord works in mysterious ways. But not today. This here is 66 tons of straight up h east. Viewing divine intervention. If God is love, then you can call me Cupid. What about that scare? We've all run the simulations. They're tough, but they ain't invincible. Stay with the master, G. He'll know what to do. Yes, sir. Sergeant. Thanks for the tank. He never gets me anything. Oh, I know what the lady's like. Not if we can help it. Sergeant, extract the chief and return to an amber clad. Roger that. Status? Sir, the prophet is bugging out. Request permission to engage. Negative, commander. I'll vector two heavies for star side intercept. Ma'am? Flip space rupture up the target's bow. It's going to jump inside the city. There's no time, sir. Green light. Green light to engage. Get us close. Ma'am. Without a destination solution, we are not losing that ship. How much further must we heft this baggage? Any cell will do. Why not toss it in with this lot? They could use the meat. Them? What about us? My belly aches. And his flesh is seared just the way I like it. Quiet. You two whimper like grunts. Fresh on, petite. He's not meant for the jails. The hierarchs have something special in mind. I have brought the incompetent. You may leave, Tartarus. But I thought. And take your brutes with you. Release the prisoner. The council decided to have you hung by your entrails. And your corpse paraded through the city. But ultimately, the terms of your execution are up to me. I am already dead. Indeed. Do you know where we are? The mausoleum of the Arbiter. Quite so. Here rests the vanguard of the greek journey. Every Arbiter, from first to last. Each one created and consumed in times of extraordinary crisis. The taming of the hunters, the grunt rebellion. Were it not for the Arbiter. The covenant would have broken long ago. Even on my knees, I do not belong in their presence. Halo's destruction was your error and you rightly bear the blame. But the council was overzealous. We know you are no heretic. This is the true face of heresy. One who would subvert our faith and incite rebellion against the high council. Our prophets are false. Open your eyes, my brothers. They will use the faith of our forefathers to bring ruin to us all. The great journey. This heretic and those who follow him must be silenced. Their slander offends all who walk the path. What use am I? I can no longer command ships, lead troops into battle. Not as you are, no. But become the Arbiter and you shall be set loose against this heresy with our blessing. What of the council? The tasks you must undertake as the Arbiters are perilous, suicidal. You will die as evil each Arbiter has before you. The council will have their corpse. What would you have your Arbiter do? When we joined the covenant we took an oath according to our station. All without exception. On the blood of our fathers, on the blood of our sons. We swore to uphold the covenant even through our dying breath. Those who would break this oath are heretics worthy of neither pity nor mercy. Even now they use our lord's creations to forecast. We shall grind them into dust and continue our march to glorious salvation. This armor suits you. But it cannot hide that mark. Nothing ever will. You are the Arbiter. The will of the prophets. But these are my elites. Their lives matter to me. Yours does not. That makes two of us. Later. There is no doubt the storm will strike. The facility will be long gone before it arrives. Warriors, prepare for combat. What is it? That stench. I've smelled it before. This will save me from the storm. But you will be consumed. Arbiter. Where is he? Stinking floodbait. Boxed himself in tight. We'll never break through this. And we shall force him out. How? The cable. I'm going to cut it. Get everyone back to the ships. Arbiter. I would rather die by your hand than let the prophet lead me to slaughter. Who has taught you these lies? The oracle. Hello. I am 343 guilty spark. I am the monitor of installation zero four. Ask the oracle about Halo. How they would sacrifice us all for nothing. More questions? Spend it. I would be happy to assist you. The elites are blind, Arbiter. But I will make them see. Unfortunately, his edification was most enjoyable. I had no choice. Holy Oracle. This heretic imperiled the great journey, Oracle. Great journey. Why do you vendors insist on using such inaccurate vertical? That is the oracle. So it is. Come. We are leaving this system. Report. Both engine cores have spun to zero. We're drifting. Archer. Pods are cold. I'll need to re key the system. Do it. And find out where we are. Sorry for the quick jump, sergeant. You. One piece. I'm good, chief? We're fine, ma'am. There's an object coming into view now. Cortana. What exactly am I looking at? That is another halo. Say what? So this is what my father found. I thought Halo was some sort of super weapon. It is. If activated, this ring will cause destruction on a galactic scale. I want all the information you've got on the first. Schematic topography, whatever. I don't care if I have the clearance or not. Yes, ma'am. Where's our target? The enemy ship has stopped above the ring, ma'am. We're going to pass right over it. Perfect. Given what we know about this ring, it's even more important that we capture the prophet of regret. Find out why he came to Earth, why he came here. Chief, take first platoon hard drop. Secure a landing zone. Sergeant, load up two flights of pelicans and follow them in. Aye, aye, ma'am. Until I can move and fight, I'm going to keep a low profile. Once you leave the ship, you're on your own. Understood. Over. Hang on to your helmet. Could he possibly make any more noise? I guess so. Wait. Go back. That's what I thought he saw. The prophet of regret is planning to activate Halo. Are you sure? I shall light this holy ring, release its cleansing flame and burn a path into the divine beyond. Pretty much. Commander, we've got a problem. So I heard. But from what I understand, the prophet will need an object, the index, to activate the ring. I've located a library similar to the one you found on the first halo. If the rings work the same way, the index should be inside. I'll bet the Covenant are thinking the exact same thing. Then we better beat them to it. Sergeant, extract your men and meet me at the library. Yes, ma'am. I'll secure the index. Chief, you take out the profit. He's given us all the intel we need. That's the largest covenant fleet I've ever seen. The largest anyone's ever seen. Get inside the temple and kill regret before it can stop us. This is not your grave. But you are welcome in it. This is unprecedented. Unacceptable. A hierarchy. His murderer was within our grasp. If you had not withdrawn our phantoms. Are you questioning my decision? No, holy one. I only wish to express my concern that the Bruce commissioning the guard was a radical step. But recent events have made it abundantly clear that the elites can no longer guarantee our safety. I shall relay your decision to the council. Politics. How tiresome. Do you know, Arbiter? The elites have threatened to resign, to quit the high council because of this exchange of hats. We have always been your protectors. These are trying times for all of us. Even as the human's annihilation failed us with satisfaction. The loss of one of the sacred rings wracked our hearts with grief. Putting aside our sorrow, we renewed our faith in the prophecy that other rings would be found. And see how our faith has been rewarded. Halo. This divine wind will rush through the stars, propelling all who are worthy along the path to salvation. But how to start this process? For ages, we searched for one who might unlock the secrets of the rings. An oracle. And with your help, we found it. With appropriate humility, we plied the oracle with questions, and it with clarity and grace, has shown us the key. You will journey to the surface of the ring and retrieve this sacred icon. With it, we shall fulfill our promise and begin the great journey. Once the shield is down, we will head straight to the library. I do not wait. Wish to keep the hierarchs waiting. The human has killed the prophet of regret. Who was it? Who do you think? The demon is here. Why? Looking for a little payback? Retrieving the icon is my only concern. Of course. In the center of this zone is a sacred icon critical to the great journey. I must find it. We shall cut into the heart of this infestation, retrieve the icons, and burn any flood that stand in our way. Your parasite is not to be trifled with. I hope you know what you're doing. More humans. We must be after the icon. On your way, Arbiter. I'll deal with these beasts. I see that power didn't join you. I'll do what I can to keep the flood off your back. Gotcha. You know, your father never asked me for help either. The index is secure. Mackenzie, Perez. How's our exit? You hear me, marines? Well, you got trouble. How you doing? Excellent work, Arbiter. The hierarchs will be pleased. Icon is my responsibility. What's your responsibility now? It is mine. A bloody fate awaits you and the rest of your incompetent race. And I, tartaruse, the chieftain of the brutes, will send you to it. And the prophets learn of this. But they will take your head when they learn. Fool. They ordered me to do it. What is that? Relax. I'd rather not piss this thing off. Demon. This one is mission and nerve and has its mind concluded. This one is but flesh and faith and is the more intuitive. Kill me or release me, parasite. But do not waste my time with talk. There is much talk and I have listened through rock and metal and time. Now I shall talk and you shall listen. Greetings. I am 2401 penitent tangent. I am the monitor of installation zero five. And I am the prophet of regret. Counselor most high hierarch of the covenant. A reclaimer here at last. We have much to do. This facility must be activated if we are to control this outbreak. Stay where you are. Nothing can be done until my sermon is complete. Nothing. True. This installation has a successful utilization record of 1.2 trillion simulated in one actual. It is ready to fire on demand. Of all the objects our lords left behind there are none so worthless as these oracles. They know nothing of the great journey. And you know nothing about containment. You have demonstrated complete disregard for even the most basic protocols. This ones containment and this ones great journey are the same. Your prophets have promised you freedom from a to existence. But you will find no salvation on this ring. Those who built this place you what they want. Do not mistake their intent. Or all will perish as they did before. This thing is right. Halo is a weapon. Your prophets are making a big mistake. Your ignorance already destroyed one of the sacred rings, demon. It shall not harm another. If you will not heal the truth then I will show it to you. There is still time to stop the key from turning. But first it must be found. You will search one likely spot. And you will search another. Fate had us meet as foes. But this ring will make us brothers. We are, all of us, gravely concerned. The release of the parasite was unexpected, unfortunately. But there is no need to panic. In truth, this is a time to rejoice. A moment that all the covenant should savor. For the sacred icon has been found. With it, our path is clear. Our entry into the divine beyond guaranteed. The great journey is nigh. And nothing, not even the flood, can stop it. Boo. Kill the demon. Split them up. One in each fountain. The hopes of all the covenant rest on your shoulders, chieftain. My faith is strong. I will not fail. Let him be. The great journey waits for no one, brother. Not even you. By the rings Arbiter. The councilors. Are they murdered by the brutes? Fire. Disloyal beasts. The prophets were fools to trust them. Your pal. Where is he going? And this time, none of you. We'll be left behind. That structure in the center of the city. It's a forerunner ship. And truth is heading straight for it. If he leads the Covenant fleet to earth, they won't stand a chance. You have to stop him. That brute has the index and Miranda and Johnson. He can activate the ring. If he does, I'll detonate in Emberclad's reactor, just like we did the autumns. The blast will destroy this city and the ring. It's not a very original plan, but we know it'll work. No. I don't want to chance a remote detonation. I need to stay here. Chief. When you get to earth, good luck. After I'm through with truth, you'll make a girl a promise. If you know you can't keep it. What is that place? Where the councilors were meant to watch the consecration of the icon. The start of the great journey. There is still time to stop the key from. I must get inside. Then. Mount up, Arbiter. I know a way to break those doors. Listen, you don't like me, and I sure as hell don't like you. But if we don't do something, Mister Moore. Hawk's gonna activate this ring. We're all gonna die. Tartarus has locked himself inside the control room. Well, I just happen to have a key. Come on. Grab a bed. It is easy. Take the icon in your hands and do as you are told. Please use caution. This reclaimer is delicate. One more word, Oracle, and I rip your eye from its. Suck it. Which is nothing compared to what I'll do to you. Godaras, stop. Impossible. Put down the icon. Put it down. And disobey the hierarchs? There are things about Halo even the hierarchs do not understand. Take care, Arbiter. What you say is. Is it oracle? What is Halo's purpose? Not another word. Please don't shake the light bulb. If you want to keep your brain inside your head. I tell those boys to chill. Go ahead, do your thing. The sacred rings. What are they? Of last resort. Built by the forerunners to eliminate potential flood hosts, thereby rendering the parasite harmless. And those who made the rings? What happened to the forerunners? After exhausting every other strategic option, my creators activated the rings. They and all additional sentient life in three radii of the galactic center died as planned. Would you like to see the relevant data, Tartarus. The prophets have betrayed us. No, Arbiter. The great journey has begun. And the brutes, not the elite, shall be the prophet's escort. What's that? A beacon. What's it doing? Communicating at superluminal speeds with the frequency. Communicating with what? The other installations show me. Fail safe protocol. In the event of unexpected shutdown, the entire system will move to standby status. All remaining platforms are now ready for remote activation. Remote activation? From here? Don't be ridiculous. Listen, Tinker bell, don't make me. Then where? Where would someone go to activate the other rings? Why, the Ark, of course. Where? Oracle is that? We've got a new contact. Unknown classification. It isn't one of ours. Take it out. This is Spartan 117. Anyone hear me? Over. Isolate that signal. Master Chief. You mind telling me what you're doing on that ship, sir? Finishing this fight. Silence fills the empty grave now that I am gone. But my mind is not at rest or questions linger on. I will ask and you will answer. All right, shoot. Arbiter, we are nearing the target. Prepare for action. What do you call him? Spotted up. I don't understand the question, 117. The master chief, he is not your friend, is he? Your foe? Easdon, AWOL and the UNSC want him back. I'm going to bring him home. I admire your sense of duty, Spartan. But if he has left the fold. He has his reason. I'm sure he does, Arbiter. And I intend to find out what they are. Well, I'm not gonna complain. Uh huh. So, tell me more about Rio. What else did I miss? Oh, man, the place is a mess. I mean, too many covenant asylum seekers all pinned up. Yeah, Demarco set a yde was crazy. Well, it could have been worse. I mean, look what happened to New Phoenix. We even caught this one sanghili freak try to detonate a havoc nuke. Oh, yeah, give it a rest. We all know you were on the other side of town when they caught that hinge head. Yeah, and where were you, Demarco? Well, Madsen and me, we were just making sure the ladies of Rio de Janeiro felt safe and secure. That's right. Just fireteam majestic. Doing a little community outreach, man. That's right. You hit people in New Phoenix, didn't you? I did. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. It's alright. I'll get over it. Hey, Lord. Let's take a look at this. There she is, man. Infinity. Ah. Fire team Majestic. Yeah, that's us. Welcome aboard, Spartans. I'm Roland ships AI at your service. On the line, Spartans. Someone will be alone to show you around shortly. All right, Majestic, warm up. Oh, they're good. Look. Oh, my. I saw her first. Hi there. Well, hello, Spartan. Paul Demarco. I lead fireteam Majestic. Wow, a whole fireteam, huh? I didn't catch your name. Sarah Palmer. Commander Sarah Palmer. I lead all the fireteams aboard Infinity fireteam. Majestic commander on deck. At ease, Spartans. Follow me. SDK is this way. Shot Hicks. Attention all hands. Tremor, slip. Space jump. This is the latest SiGInt on Covenant fleet locations, captain. Pretty standard positioning. Commander Palmer? Things get boring in Spartintown? Captain Lasky, you know I come up here for my peace and quietenhe. I'm not interrupting nap time, am I? On the contrary. Show starts at 0500. We've waited six months. We could spend another 48 hours running the teams through the war games. Navy disagrees with Spartans on this one. They want you ready. Now. Ladies and other Spartans, listen up. Your new workplace is a planet first discovered by humanity six months ago called Requiem. Some of the old hands here know what you're in for. The rest of you, your due in education. The egg heads upstairs want to set up research bases. But before they can do that, we need to fend off some covenant squatters. The cubbies believe this is the home of one of their gods. The way I see it, if those freaks want to meet God, it's our duty to help them along. Infinity. Clear of slip's face. Captain Lasky, Lieutenant Austin. Word is given. Some vessels are by bargaining. Governor. Deploying spawn aircraft. Requiem corridor is clear. Destin one on approach. Hang on, we'll go inside. Here we go. Majestic, what are we flying into? Turbulence? Wasn't this planet supposed to have been cleared already? That was the idea. Yeah. These things just pop up. wherever they want to, don't they? I mean, how is that even fair, huh? Matthew, look out. Fire! Get back to cover. Majestic. Oh, yeah. It's gonna take a lot more than this to kill me. Commander. Hey, commander. What happened to Hoya? Hoya happened to Hoya. He followed orders. Fine. Armor bay's waiting, team leader. Commander Palmer. What's that? Crimson team scored the first grab. Whatever it is, it's got the egghead. What's happening? Lost power, sir. Trying to source it now. Get the engine room on the line. Doctor Glassman, infinity is losing power. So I've noticed. Captain, artificial gravity is offline as well, sir. Being pulled towards the planet. I need answers. You take engines built by aliens a hundred thousand years ago and hire a war criminal? To bolt them onto the ship, you can't expect predictable behavior. Roland. What is this damn thing? Unknown, Spartan. Status update, Sarah. Further attempts at physical persuasion haven't had much effect. Damn things stuck fast. She's all yours, doc. Hey, look at this. This is amazing. I've never seen anything like this. Doctor Glassman. Captain Lasky. The captain of Aladdin requests permission to bring the prisoner aboard. Last chance to change your mind. It's too late for this, Sarah. We need to know what's going on. She was locked up for a reason. Mission granted. Rolling. Doctor Halsey, thank you for coming. I'm not walking around the ship I built with my hands cuffed. Show me the artificial. Rather dark for a proper investigation. We have random fluctuations all over the shed. Doc. Power still completely out of ground zero. I'll get additional lighting set up ASAP. That would be good. Have there been any other reactions since. Since what happened to Doctor Glassman? No. I see. Careful. I'm not Henry Glassman, captain. Trust me, Doctor. I know who you are. Yes. And I see you've decided I rate three of the new model. Captain Lasky asked for the best. And yet. What is it? Doctor room? Why do they have us guarding some old lady? She's bad news, man. She created the original Spartans. Master chieftain. No way. Yeah, yeah. Story goes she kidnapped a bunch of kids. What? What an old lady like her do with kids? First we taught them how to be silent. Then we taught them how to be Spartans. Rolling. Engine room's on lockdown, captain. All systems operated on fly infinity without human aid. Don't worry, Roland. We'll take her off your hands again shortly. And now we're letting the war criminal touch things. I could type for her if that'd make you feel better. It would help. She installed these engines. No one in the UNSC understands them as well as she does. Hey. The artifact, forerunner, is talking to your engines. Also forerunner. But it is also communicating with these other systems as well. Some systems. Some electrical, lower deck life support only. The engines are forerunner tech. The rest is human. Indeed. But the artifact is reaching out to them. And it. And your engines are transmitting. Terraquil. You came here to study the planet instead of something on the planet is studying you. Why the hell did you volunteer to babysit the dragon lady anyway? I'm just curious, that's all. Whatever, man. Have fun. Doctor Halsey, Spartan Thorne. I'll be your escort for the day. You knock. At least most people don't. Looks like we better get you to work. Doctor. I understand you worked with the original Spartans? I'm afraid it's all still quite classified. But the original Spartans were conscripted as children. I did what was required for. Why children? Why do you think? Well, it could have given them an edge. Starting that young, not knowing anything else. There were many reasons behind the choices we had to make. Psychological and physiological. Psychological? So you don't think we're capable of being Spartans? Perhaps some of you are closer than others. If you'll excuse me, please. Roland, bring up req 153 n. I presume you'd like to start it before the tragedy. Please, Roland. Castle team just got hit running supplies into Copernicus. Copernicus? The science base? Looking for the librarian aihdeme master chief encountered. Instead, they found something else. Jewel and Dama. Yeah, because Requiem wasn't messed up enough. So, Mister Thorne, what interest is my research to you specifically? I enlisted with the Spartans because I was in the army a year before my family and friends were killed in New Phoenix. I always thought the Spartans were special. Maybe I could have saved them. And does it help you? Help your grief? Being here on Requiem, shooting at. What do they call them? Prometheans, doctor. Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity. I'm simply curious what gifts, if any, the Promethean life forms have to offer. They're forerunner robots. Hard light and battle armor. Ruthless, brutal. What can they offer us? Nothing but trouble, doctor. They're simply killing machines. Interesting. Doctor Halsey. Quiet, please. I'm working. I keep telling you people, I don't speak single progress. I've got to have better equipment, more materials. You're giving me two sticks to rub together here? Technologically speaking. Okay, okay. No need for a translation there. You're saying there's an actual living forerunner inside of this thing? I wonder what she could tell us. Crimson has the situation on the ground covered. Majestic, get that package off Galileo base and back to infinity, pronto. So now we're Crimson's delivery service? How come we never get the interesting jobs with me? Moving out. Get to cover. Just had to open your big mouse again, Madsen. We're not dead yet, grandson. Regroup on me. Go on! Madsen, move it. And she airs down. Yes, Thorne. I noticed. All right, Spartans. Packing up this picnic. Everybody get to the pelican. Let's move. Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. If we try to fly, we're dead. Hoya. Yeah? Take this. Prep for liftoff. I've got an idea. Thorn, get back here. That's an order. We've got this. Just go. Taking a reading. Oh, my. Doctor, a moment, please. Intriguing. This thing looks kind of familiar. Yes, it's very similar to an AI matrix, but we expected that. Doctor Holt. Romans. Freeze all monitors. Pictures? Civilian life. Maybe a colony or something. Not pictures. Memories. An alien AI full of human memories. That's new. Phoenix. I grew up there. Nah, I can't be right. You knew this, didn't you? Captain Lasky, the UNSC is aware that prometheans are ancient humans. That is not ancient. That is the attack on Earth from six months ago. You knew. This is impossible. I have no idea how the hell these are these memories got from Earth to hear. Thorn. What is it, doctor? Life is too short. I will never learn all that exists in our own tiny galaxy, let alone rest of the universe. And I so desperately want to know everything. But the UNSC acts like children at play in a sandbox, mistaking its edges for the limits of the world. I bet they keep you in something a lot smaller than a sandbox. From now on, Catherine. Why? I shared no information. The intelligence already knew my name, my task, and offered data that might advance our research by years. This is a research mission, after all. Even if you treat it like a live fire war game. Commander Palmer. Roland, not now. Actually, a bit of an emergency, captain. Spartan Thorne has been detected alive on Requiem. Quite honestly, I'm not entirely sure what I've done. Can I ask you a question, doc? What were you hoping to achieve with your little subterfuge? I mean, Captain Lasky put a lot of faith in you. Yes. His hospitality speaks wonders. Come on, doc. What has keeping secrets ever really gained you? What is hidden can be useful. Such as? Such as the phrase undid iridium. Undid. Undid. Did. Did. Un. Did. UNSC. AI override instructions active. Doctor Kathryn Halsey. Roland, tell the guards outside that Captain Lasky has requested my presence in his ready room. And block all further communications. Yes. Captain has to see you, doctor. Have a seat, doctor. Thank you, gentlemen. You may go. Roland, give me full access to this terminal. Yes, doctor Kathryn Palsey. Didact's hand. If people would just share things with me, I could solve all the world's problems. Send everything the UNSC has on the library. Yes, doctor. Katherine Halsey. This is all my own research. I need new information. Anything that has been kept from me. Only one data point exists that is not your own research. Debriefing of Master Chief Petty Officer Spartan 117 post new Phoenix incident. John, I. Roland. Prep a pelican for immediate launch. And patch this terminal into the comm systems. Infiltrated by the artifact. Doc, whatever you did to me. Yes, doctor Kathryn Halsey. We have played your game quite long enough, and we are both out of time. In our previous conversation, you mentioned assistance. Who but the didact's hand could offer me a promethean soul? What we both want. Julie. Librarian. A powerful name for me as well as you. Librarian was very fond of humans. Did you know that? That was a dirty trick, doc. My turn now. Stay right where you are. Doctor. Doctor hall. I've underestimated you long enough. A cryotube should hold you until John's alive. He was here on this ship. Nobody told me he was alive. Quite a busy captain. Too late. They're here too. Halsey, come on. Stop them. Captain Laskin. Oh. Hands. Battle sticks. It's not a drill. Throne. I'm not a Spartan. I gotta have some rest. Please. Why are we walking anyway? Isn't your armor all full of comm gear? Used to be. How much further, Galileo? Base is two, maybe three clicks that way. Another couple hours and we'll be home. Doctor Glossman. Get to safety. Captain. The Promethean. Keep moving. Doctor. Found him. Roland. Got the policy too. Still alive? For now. Is there something, sir? Maybe a little? Man. We've been looking absolutely everywhere for you. Lieutenant James, take us out of orbit. Move us far enough away from requiem that those things can't get on board. Controls aren't responding, captain. Infinity's locked in position. Captain, look here. The artifact is acting as a slip space anchor, holding us in place. Slip space isn't physical. It can't. There's still a great many things we don't know about slip space. You. Quiet. You were supposed to fix this whole thing days ago. I'm sorry, captain. Damn it. It was a smash and grab. They came here just for her. Some of these things tags belong to Spartans. With my thanks. Nice. Watch this. You guys are getting all the cool stuff. Ah. What's this? Oh, great. I got a map. Captain Lasky. Admiral Osman. You've seen the report on Doctor Halsey. I was advised to keep Katherine in the darkest, deepest hole I could find. Or have her removed from the equation entirely. Regrettably, I chose to do neither. So, captain, today I shall follow my predecessor's advice. You are hereby ordered to eliminate Doctor Catherine Elizabeth Halsey. I think it is power you seek. Water. Knowledge is power. Glassman did. I wouldn't be so sure. The protective shield is emanating from the structure itself. And if I'm right. Access requires a more human touch. She's only out here because of me. I mean, we're soldiers, not hitmen. Halsey knew what she was doing when she made friends with the bad guys. I'm serious. You shouldn't have to execute a civilian. No, but it has to be done. And I don't trust anyone else to do it. Right. There has to be another way. I mean. I know what you mean, Tom. And I won't see you court martialed over that woman. Sarah. Stand down. Orders are orders, Tom. This isn't my first rodeo. I don't suppose it is. Roland. Where's fireteam? Majestic. Right now. Welcome. You. You are librarian, wife of didact. There is a covenant cultist leader outside. He thinks you have something valuable. He is correct. But what I have is not for him. It is for you. Majestic. We got this. You go get the old lady. This is the Janus key. It offers the real time location of every piece of forerunner technology in the galaxy. Every piece. We did nothing. Create so much without a means to catalog it all. This was meant for my husband. To help your people when his meditation was complete. Take this key to the absolute record. Use what you find to propel humankind. Why? Give this to me. Requiem's time is at an end. The key and what it details must not be lost. Or. Take the key. No. What the hell are you guys doing here? Captain Lasky sent us to rescue Doctor Halsey. Rescue her? She's a traitor. Out the respect. If she was on Jule Mdahma's side, then why was she so sure I needed to get this before he could? This projection device that majestic found shows two more artifacts down on Requiem just like the one in our hangar. Now they are the requiem of a slip space conduit which is physically connecting infinity to Requiem. If deactivate them, infinity should be free to move. Commander Palmer, we're sending down the necessary deactivation codes. Majestic and I will take care of the first artifact. Roland, send fireteam Crimson to second set of coordinates. You got it, commander. Commander. Oh, hell. They're not attacking. They're entering flip space. This can't be good. It's not us that's moving. It's Requiem. The artifact content in it's. They're pulling infinity with it. Straight into the sun. If we have to find those artifacts before infinity can leave, then let's get moving, Spartans. Sarah, how's it going on Requiem? It's getting awful warm out here. Crimson got their shore. Are you tripping? Slightly more difficult. Anybody tell these goons they're bodies left to behind. Justin. Move up. Coming through. Fire in the hole. On it. Almost there. It's moving. Majestic, move up. Artifacts offline. Let's get out of here. Doctor Glasman. It's off the floor, captain. Try now. Lieutenant James. It's working. We're free. Sarah, pour on whatever extra speed you got. We gotta leave now. We're almost up. Crimson or dead ahead. Commander Hutchin. All hands aboard. Lt, get us the hell out of here. Aye, sir. Emergency jump complete, captain. Injuries reported on multiple decks but no major casualties. Captain Lasky to all crew. We made it. Good work, everyone. You sent them to stop me? I sent them to rescue Doctor Halsey. Do you see a difference? Doctor, what have you got? Well, the first test showed that it is inert. But this part's really weird. On a molecular level. It's incomplete. It makes no sense. It's like. It's like we're only seeing half of it. That was before I knew my compatriots were a hit squad, not a rescue team. Not that I fared much better in your care. The UNSC just tried to execute me. So you'll need to offer something other than idle threats. If you want me to help you. That's easy, jewel. I want revenge.
