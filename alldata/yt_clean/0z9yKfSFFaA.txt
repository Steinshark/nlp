[Adum] -I'm Adam. [Gael] -I'm Gael. [Gael] -I'm Scott. [Adum] -and we're in the- [Gael] -Twilight Brothers. [Adum] -Was that his own arm? That's what it looks like. It looked like one of those things where it's gonna zoom out, like: I'm crazy! This is.... I love how confusing this is already. This is great. The intro in the last movie was like, really metaphorical, but it... I figured it out. [Scoot] -You did! You did a really good job with the mirror last time. [Adum] -This is literal and I don't know what's going on... [Gael] -He's on the precipice. Oh my God. [Adum] -Was that a vampire or a werewolf? [Gael] -Okay, so he just drive by... bit on his palm. [Adum] -Yeah. [Scoot] -It reminded me of how people die in Cyberpunk 2077. [Adum] -Oh, true. His leg wasn't through his chest though. [Gael] -Uh... [Scoot] -His leg wasn't always the way through his chest. [Scoot] -That's how you tell the difference. [Gael] -Man, that's uh... some... major acne. [Adum] -Yeah, he's got a problem. [Gael] -So, shouldn't they be in school? It's like, is this a weekend? [Adum] -He's learned everything! [Gael] -What about her? [Adum] -He doesn't s- [Gael] -Is he gonna keep her dog gone? [Scoot] -He's gone to grade 12... 87 times! [Adum] -They've tried everything! He still won't pass! [Gael] -Oh yeah... the cop dad, who always wears this cop uniform at home... [Adum] -Well that's how you know. [Scoot] -He's a real &quot;blue lives matter&quot; guy. [Adum] -That's how you know he's a cop. I love that he's wearing like the police shirt, but underneath he's just got like a regular... [Gael] -Yeah, it's just a polo or some shit. It BARELY looks like a police shirt. Can we just agree like, it's like a half sleeve... [Scoot] -He might have made it himself. -You use your newfound freedom to see some of your other friends too. Like Jacob. [Gael] So why... [Adum] -Like, because they need to... because she loves Edward and they're forcing in the conflict. They need the script to have her hanging out with Jacob, even though she loves Edward- like her mind's already fuckin' made up. [Gael] -You know what? Maybe... maybe- [Adum] -Like, the script needs the conflict. [Gael] -They haven't considered that Jacob might be better for her. [Scoot] -Have you considered that Jacob might be a little better- [Adum] -No! [Gael] -So, Adam just tossed me the Blu-ray cover for this, and I swear to God every- the cover for every Twilight film is just the three of them mugging at the camera. and it's [stammers] and she looks so... like they all look so disinterested. Here we have the Twilight Saga. Eclipse... La Saga Twilight Hesitation. [Adum] -Hesitation? [Everyone laughs] [Scoot] -&quot;Hesitation&quot; [Gael] -The Hesitation, Yeah. [Scoot] -is the name of the movie. [Adun] -In French, yeah. [Gael] -A new Volvo! I think we know who uh who's sponsoring these films. [Scoot] -Hold on, Kristen Stewart got a new Volvo? What? [Gael] -Because like, remember in the first film when he got it he saved her from rapists? And he got her and he saved her in his Volvo? [Scoot] -Yeah, it's the anti-rape mobile. [Gael] -Is that her mom? [Adum] -I guess, this is what we're establishing now. [Scoot] -I'm gonna go: yes. [Clip] -I'm just saying: if you go to the University of Alaska... I'm never going to see you. -They have a really great Science Program. -You mean Edward program? [Adum making disgusted noises] -He watches you. [Adum laughs] [Scoot] -I mean, he really does watch her, like her mom is not wrong. He watches her like a fuckin' creep. [Adum] -Yeah... Does she know he's there right now? Like, is he just not allowed outside? -Congraduations. [Gael] -Oh god... [Adum] -It's the box from old boy. [Gael] -Oh! Oh no! [Scoot laughs hysterically] [Adum] -It's the same! [Adum] -Running! [Scoot] -Oh Peter Facinelli can get it! [Gael] -He's running like a champ. He's auditioning for the next Jason Bourne film. [Adum w/ stu[id voice] -Jesus Christ! It's Jason Bourne! [Adum laughing and screaming] -She's in their territory... [Scoot] -Can't they sort of fly though? What's this- [Adum] -Okay, wait. Hold up! [Scoot] -What's the situation there? [Adum] -She's defecting to the South Korean border. They can't get her there... [Gael] -Yeah, it's the DMZ. I love how long this chase scene is going on without offering anything like, interesting visually... It's just a lot of this- [Scoot] -A lot of fast cats. [Adum] -The uh... trees trees going past... [Adum laughs] [Adum] -Ah... good face... Oh man... [Adum] -Oh! Music time... with uh... [Gael] -Awww.... [Adum] -The fuckin' stupid one... [Gael] -Let's see how jacked he is now. [Scoot] -Hey... hey... let's- [Gael] -Look at that- [Scoot] -Let's not judg too harshly.. He's warmer: first of all. -Just checking to see if she's still human. [Gael] -I will kill him. Oh my god... Oh yeah, there's a race for her pending. [Adum] -I love how there's this like whole War thing happening, in the background, that like, nobody in the city really knows about... just connected to her, pretty much... [Clip] -Hold on tight. [Adum] -You fuckin' slut! Don't do this in front of him! [Gael] -Wait... what? [Adum chuckles] [Gael] -You just got to school! You just she got- [Scoot] -You just left your fiancee... [Adum] -She got a ride from Edward to leave somewhere with Jacob... [Gael] -Don't... don't you have class? -We all have to live the Leah Sam Emily pain Fest. [Scoot] -I love how Taylor Lautner's body says &quot;jacked 25 year old,&quot; and his voice says &quot;little boy.&quot; [Scoot w/ boy voice] -I'm Taylor Lautner, I'm jacked. [Adum w/ stupid voice] -I'm Taylor Lautner. I'm the only one out of the three of us that has no career. [Music] [Clip] -Have you imprinted on someone? [Gael] So they're trying to explain this imprinting concept, can someone help me out with it? [Adum] -Uh....... [Gael] -Okay... [Scoot] -You good? [Scoot laughing] -You got it? [Clip] -You knew this was gonna happen. -Not in a month! I mean not before you you've... you've even lived! [Adum laughs] [Clip] -or before I could- [Clip] -but he's got his hooks in here so deep... [Gael] -Oh God, hooks; that's a good one. Who's this guy? [Gael] -Oh that's the guy... that's the guy from the opening. [Gael] -That's the guy from the opening who just- [Scoot] -Oh and now he's a vampire. [Gael] -Can you imagine just sleeping on the couch with a police file open in your lap? [Adum] -Kiss! KISS! [Scoot] -It's her dad... [Clip] -You know... [Adum bursts out laughing] [Adum] -He's hiding in the closet. [Adum] -This is just the fuckin' fanatic again. [Gael] -I was gonna say: it's like the fanatic. [Adum] -That was very similar, remember? Oh! Your eyes are weird now... [Gael] -Yeah, his eyes are very inconsistent... [Clip] -I know, I smell like a dog. -Somethings wrong. [Adum] -I know I smell like a dog. [Adum chuckles] [Scoot joins in on the laughter] [Gael] -Come on, guys... [Scoot] -There's not gonna be a better line than that... [Adum] -So, all of their eyes are black now. [Gael] -It's to distinguish them from Victoria's Army. Because, Victoria is like- [Scoot] -But, weren't they like sort of golden before? And the bad ones were red? Why have we changed? [Clip] -I could care less what you need. -All right, we're done here. -No, you're done here. -Stop! I'm tired of this! From now on I'm Switzerland, okay? [Adum] -I'm Switzerland... [Gael] -It's like in World War II, she's neutral? [Scoot] -Her metaphor was less about being neutral and more that she loves hiding Nazi gold... [Gael] -Oh my God... -Doesn't he own a shirt? [Adum] -Jacob is projecting so hard! Remember his line like, &quot;he's got his claws in you&quot;? He's like &quot;oh you want to meet?&quot; He shows up like buff like &quot;oh, I'm just happening to not wear a shirt right now.&quot; -Oh Shit! I'm sorry... [Adum] -He is being the manipulator and he's trying to blame Edward while he's doing it... [Gael] -No, how- [Adum] -He is projecting so hard! He's a sociopath! [Gael] -We have established- [Adum] -This kiss is real! -It's beautiful... -and they were right... [Adum cackles] [Gael] -A lot of screaming. [Adum] -The Revenant! Dude, this is the Revenant! This is the opening scene! [Scoot] -I think it's The Revenant... [Gael] -Oh, that's a good face ! [Adum] -I love it! Oh my God... re-contest! -There's no magical bean... -no special powers... [Gael] -Oh she's like Aoin like, I am no man I will stab- you know, get it? Anyone? [Scoot] -No no no no no no no no no.. [Adum exlaims] [Scoot] -No! [Gael] -Hey... what... what? The shirt's not even like ripped... she stabbed herself without even making a puncture hole... [Scoot] -Yeah, I don't think you even pierced the skin... [Adum] -That was really weird... [Gael] -Oh my God, so she stabbed herself to distract... [Adum] -Yeah... [Scoot] -As a distraction... [Gael] -Well, I'm wondering if that's gonna be reincorporated. I wonder if we're gonna get somebody- [Adum] -Bella's gonna stab herself. [Gael] -Yeah... [Adum] -Bella's gonna stab herself. [Adum laughs] [Adum] -Oh no... you're totally right... [Adam cackles] [Adum] -That was really funny! These movies are just getting more and more entertaining... [Gael] -I'm enjoying it. [Adum] -I hate the fans. They don't know which ones are the good ones. [Scoot] -As the ratings go down our entertainment goes up. [Adum] -Oh my God! [Gael] -What?! [Adum] -That's how it works... [Scoot] -PS, we're back to gold eyes, guys. [Adum] -Yeah, that's weird... [Gael] -Maybe the effects people just forgot for a couple of scenes. [Adum] -Maybe... [Gael] -If you bite someone when they're old do they stay old forever? [Scoot] -Yes. [Adum] -Which is why Edward totally looks 17. As canon, he is 17. [Scoot] -Think how cold she is right now... [Adum] -Yeah, but like that's why he's a good summer boyfriend. [Gael] -She needs a quilt just to be warm. She's wearing a sweater. [Adum] -How come he has a reflection in the mirror?! [Scoot] -They... they forgot... [Gael] -Look at this juxtaposition: with Jacob she can be outside, he can keep her warm, it's just- it's just outdoors- [Scoot] -Nature walks... [Gael] -It's beautiful... [Scoot] -fuck a dog... [Gael] -Exactly... With Edward she just has to be like in a coffin like, indoors all the time... [Scoot] -Yeah. [Clip] -and you need to know that I'm in love with you. [Gael] -Oh no! He just admitted his love for her! [Adum] -Oh no! It's like, he's been in love with her and we didn't know that before, but now we know it. Because, he said it... [Scoot] -Oh, this is news... -I don't feel that way for you. -I don't buy it! [Adum] -Yeah, it's clear you don't feel that way... This is really fuckin' rapey, he's a piece of shit! She just said &quot;no&quot; and he's trying to convince her! [Adum and Scoot arguing] -I mean he probably can't even kiss you without hurting you. [Gael] -She doesn't know yet! she's trying to- [Gael] -He's trying to convincer her! [Adum] -No! Stop it! -I'm gonna call Child Protective Services! It's time to stop! [Adum] -I'm.. I'm the warm one! [Gael] -Exactly! [Scoot] -He's fuzzy. [Adum] -Stop it! She said &quot;no&quot; and then he went in for the kiss! This is terrible! She pushed him off! This should end here! Thank you, that's so funny, she just broke her fuckin' hand! [Adum laughing obnoxiously] [Adum] -Turns out... turns out I'm a better judge of character here... [Gael] -No... It was a fit of passion... [Scoot] -Hey, the movie's not over. Things could change. [Gael] -Things can change, okay? -You have a choice. -None of us did, but you do and you're choosing wrong. [Gael] -Yeah, you're choosing wrong- [Adum] -What the fuck?! [Gael] -YEAH! [Adum] -She... it's amazing how everybody in the movie just tries to manipulate her and she has like- [Gael] -They're trying to guide her. [Scoot] -Even OTHER vampires are team Jacob. [Adum] -Even people that aren't trying to fuck her! Like... [Scoot laughs] -Oh there she is. [Scoot] -You can settle down with Jacob... [Adum] -Was this her life that she regrets not continuing? [Adum] -Being raped by a drunk man? [Scoot] -Getting raped by a Mustachio the drunk man? [Adum] -Did Carlisle turn you into a vampire because he was hungry, or because as you were gonna die anyway? [Gael] -I think was was just gonna die. [Adum] -What's the argument? What is the argument you're making?! [Scoot] -I'm not sure how this story applies to Bella...? [Adum] -Yeah! Like, what is the argument?! [Adum] -Like, 100 fuckin' years from now, VR will be so sick you won't even tell the difference between that in real life. So, just hang on for another like... what? [Scoot] -Hang on... [Adum] -Half of the life that you've already lived... [Gael] -See? You're just making it like a like a cold rational argument. But, this is an emotional place that she's in... [Adum] -Oh yeah, this is a woman's movie... [Gael] -Like... No! It's it's not a womans... [Scoot and Adum laughing] [Gael] -She's talking about how when you don't have- [Scoot] -Ugh, I'm so mad you said that before me... -and if you can't control yourselves... [Gael] -This guy's delivery is excellent. Can we appreciate the acting on this guy? [Scoot] -I love Riley beers. Were they all fighting the cars? [Adum] -I don't know what's going on! But, it's really funny! [Scoot] -Did they beat up a car? -kiss in your hand I blame it on the whole inner animal thing. [Gael] -&quot;Inner animal.&quot; Isn't that... isn't that a hot? He has like an inner animal that he can control. -I made it myself. [Adum] -If someone won't fuckin' take no for an answer and then a few days later it's like, &quot;I'm really sorry.&quot; DON'T fuckin' buy it... Don't trust that! [Gael] -Why not?! It's a second chance! [Scoot] -Cause he's good for you. [Adum] -No no no no. [Scoot] -He was sorry. [Adum] -No no no no. [Scoot] -He made a mistake and he learned. [Adum] -The world is a cruel and dark place... [Gael] -Okay... coming from a vampire.. [Scoot] -Yeah, when you're va- when you're on Team Edward... [Gael] -Oh! [Scoot] -Oh, nice bracelet! Where'd you get it? [Scoot] -I hope a dog gave that to you... [Gael] -What if... what if he gets her a bat necklace? Like a necklace- [Scoot] -Oh my God.. [Adum] -She's... she's just rocking so many fuckin' weird furry things... [Gael] - like, trinkets and shit. [Gael] -Oh Carlisle, ooooh! Oh man, he's so perfect for the role. [Adum] -These movies always get so slow when it gets to the action scenes. Isn't that weird? It's so crazy. [Scoot] -How is the action always the most boring thing? [Adum] -That's a huge fuckin' dog... [Gael] -Pretty big... [Adum] -Oh my God! [Clip] -It's gonna be a hundred times worse than this, right? [Adum barks] [Gael] -He can't really talk back. [Gael] -Ah... come on... how can you... [Scoot] -She loves him! Team Jacob! You're a cutter? But, you're a boy? -all the training the Confederate Army gave me... [Gael] -Confederate? Was this person in the in the American Civil War? [Scoot] -Oh... I wonder what side he was on... I hope it was the good one. [Clip] -This happened during the Civil -I was the youngest major in the Texas Cavalry? [Adum] -Oh my God, what's happening with your accent? [Scoot] -Why did you become Southern? [Gael] -You become southern when your mouth is just on one side of your face? [Adum] -Yeah.. [Gael] -That's how you become Southern. [Adum] -There's a lot of fuckin' flashbacks that don't add anything to the movie... [Scoot] -Did you see the horse bow? [Gael] -Take notes, Adam. [Clip] -Maria was creating an army? -They were very common in the South. [Gael] -Vampire armies?? [Gael] -Wait, that makes the Northern victory even more impressive. [Scoot] -That's true! The South had vampires?? and lost??? What a bunch of fuckin' losers! [Scoot laughs] [Adum laughs] [Adum] -What was that sound effect?! [Scoot] -The boy was made of metal?! [Adum] -Yeah! [Gael] -I believe... [Music] [Adum] -All right, you got too many whispery bitches... You gotta cut one loose. [Adum] -Is that you whispering, Scoot? Or the movie? [Gael] -Yeah that is Scoot whispering. [Scoot] -If... if you can't tell... [Scoot] -Then it doesn't matter... [Laughter] -Alice would have seen. She wanted to make it- [Adum] -That was a really weird cut... They're breaking the fucking 180 degree Rule and it's really pissing me off... It's really jarring... Way to make something like, way more complicated than it needs to be. That was like five shots! [Laughter] [Clip] -Okay, either it's so dangerous that I have to hide, or it's so easy that you're gonna be sidelined. [Adum] -What is with the way you're talking right now? She's like turning into some fuckin' valley girl... [Scoot] -Why can't Bella walk? [Adum] -She needs to get muscly. [Scoot] -Is she just lazy? [Adum] -She's trying to confuse the sweat. [Scoot] -Does her stupid dad not know anything that's going on? [Gael] -He's completely clueless... He's... he's very much the the Aunt May of this... of this series... he literally no clue... [Scoot] -I guess so. Some sort of Spiderman? Are you a Spiderman, Peter? [Adum] -Forgive us our trespasses... [Adum and Gael play out Spiderman scene] [Gael] -Hey look, they're having conversations that are relevant to her plot... [Adum] -Something about marriage or something... [Clip] -Oh my god! Dad, I'm a virgin. -Ahhh de de... okay... [Adum] -I like how she had to explain to her dad that she's a virgin. He's like, &quot;fuckin' liar.&quot; [Scoot] -Oh I just kind of assumed you were a whore, this is news to me... [Clip] -You said that you wanted me to have every Human Experience... -Not ones that will risk killing. [Adum] -What? Sorry? [Gael] -That fucking her would risk killing her. Why? Because, he can't control himself. [Adum] -No, when he says killing her: I think he means turning her into a vampire. [Scoot] -Is he worried that he might fuck her in half? [Gael] -I think he's worried that I might fuck her to death... [Adum] -Stephanie Meyer is basically like... you know how like the Lolly artists will be like, it's like a seven-year-old but actually they're like a thousand years old? Stephanie Meyer's like &quot;Oh, he looks like a 17 year old but he's actually 90, right?&quot; [Gael] -Wait, did she just agree to marry him? I don't know what... [Adum] -I don't know... [Adum] -Is that like, Bryce Dallas Howard or what? Like... [Gael] -Actually... actually.... It actually might be... -I think we should wait to tell him. [Adum] -So now, they're like getting married and she doesn't want to tell Jacob... [Gael] -Yeah... &quot;I don't want Jacob see the ring.&quot; [Gael] -Speak of the devil. [Adum] -Thank fucking christ. [Gael] -This music though, holy shit... [Adum] -It's gettin' epic, okay? [Scoot: weird chuckle] [Scoot] -What a silly shot... [Gael] -That is really really dumb... [Scoot trying to talk while laughing] [Scoot] -You we're hiding in the lake... For how long? Asshole... [Adum] -They were walking the entire time, but he just got like.. [Gael] -They walked across the lake from one side to the other... [Clip] -Thank you. [Scoot] -It's literally just one guy bringing her to the other guy... [Adum] -They just trade off... Like fucking... you deal with her for a bit. [Clip] -oh it's fine... [Gael] -She's really cold... Guess who she could use right now that she's really cold? He'd be already getting it. [Scoot] -Almost like he's the worst boyfriend in the world. [Gael] -Oh my God he's getting the thing! [Gael] -The thing we're talking about. [Scoot clapping and chanting] -Yes! Warm dog warm dog! [Gael] -Oh my God, YESSSSSS! [Adum] -I like how they put her in this specific scenario... [Clip] -YEAH!!!! [Adum] -They wrote this so that she would &quot;need&quot; him right now... -I am hotter than you... [Gael] -&quot;I am hotter than you.&quot; He said it! [Adum] -In her day-to-day life she wouldn't be fucking camping in a blizzard on a mountain, you know? Like... This is a very specific scenario... [Scoot] -You Don't Know Her Hobbies... [Adum] -She showed up here unprepared! To face the actual environment! She doesn't know what the fuck she's doing! [Gael] -So on top of this... [Adum] -I'm surprised she brought a tent... [Scoot] -Now THAT ladies and gentlemen... is a GOOD DOG. -faster if you took your clothes off... [Gael] -&quot;Faster if you took your clothes off.&quot; [Adum] -It's true, that's what they teach you in scouts: you all get naked and cuddle. [Scoot] -Adam you need to stop bragging about getting molested in Scouts... -I know she's in love with you -But, she's in love with me too. [Gael and Scoot exclaim] [Gael] -and she's in love er er with me. [Adum] -That's such bullshit. [Gael] -Oh my God! [Adum] -That right there is like cancel worthy... [Scoot] -Jacob wouldn't lie, Adam. Dogs are physically incapable of lying. [Cool Cat] -Dogs are my friends, identify yourself! -If she chooses me... [Gael] -She won't. [Adum] -She's fuckin' engaged, dude! Like, fuckin' let it go! What is wrong with you?! This is the same fucking director as Hard Candy, 30 Days of Night, and Bandersnatch the Black Mirror thing. [Gael] -Oh my God... [Scoot] -He also, I believe, directed the pilot of 2012's: Awake, starring Dylan Minnette. Clay Jensen of 13 Reasons Why fame [Adum and Scoot] -Shared universe! [Scoot] -question mark? [Adum] -Like, do you not bring a fucking jacket? You idiot... what are you doing right now? There's snow in the air! What are you doing right now? There should be condensation coming from their breath, right now. I am an expert in this. I did my research. [Gael] -Where is the director of Frozen? [Adum] -Yeah. -Maybe I'll get myself killed and make it simple. [Gael] -Ooooooh! Classic teen aingst... [Adum] -Just fucking... everybody kill themselves: the movie is done. You know? [Gael] -Maybe I'll just die and then you'll feel better... [Scoot] -Jacob might have borderline personality disorder. But, I'm still on his side... [Adum] -He's a total piece of shit! -Kiss me! [Everyone exclaims] [Adum] -Bitch! Make up your goddamn mind! STOP! [Gael] -YEAH! [Adum] -This is disgusting! [Scoot] -This is his Team Jacob all the way! [Adum] -STOP THIS! [Clip] -This is sick! [Gael] -Oh isn't this great cinematography... [Adum] -Yeah... [Gael] -Just on a set. In front of a back painting. [Scoot] -They did with the Oscar... [Adum] -You don't give a shit about anybody! She does all this shit in front of the other guy! This is one of those scenarios where if this was happening where like social media was a thing, if this was like 10 years later... Edward and Jacob would team up and fuckin' record her and be like &quot;gotcha, bitch.&quot; and make her like famous on the internet like, you fucking slut! -I love you more. [Gael] -&quot;I love you more.&quot; [Adum] -She is so rude! [Cool Cat] -But, that's really really mean! [Adum] -Oh no... [Scoot] -Brace for- oh my God! The crazy face breaking! [Gael] -Really? [Adum] -They just choose a fucking field to fight in. You know? [Gael] -I love it. [Adum] -Like, this is just shit I would film when I was like 13. The field outside the school, we're gonna have a fucking battle, like... You know? Like, this is so stupid. [Gael] -I was gonna say, this has &quot;student film&quot; written all over it. [Adum] -Yeah... [Clip] -She knew we weren't there, but she caught my scent. [Gael] -How? [Adum] -Did you smell like a dead guy? [Adum] -This is so silly looking... [Adum] -It looks so bad! [Laughter] [Scoot] -Look, we... I know we've seen it 12 times at this point... What the fuck... are vampires made of? [Gael] -This music, though... [Adum] -Very inspired... [Gael] -Oh yeah, that's the word I would use... stab yourself stab yourself now [Gael] -She's gonna do it, she's gonna do it, she's gonna do it. [Adum] -HA HA HA what a fucking loser! [Continues laughing] [Clip] -Victoria! [Adum] -This is so silly! I can't believe how poorly they did this. [Scoot] -Victoria was a bitch. [Adum] -Oh my God... [Gael] -Is she gonna die yet? Oh, okay... [Adum] -All right... [Scoot] -oops. Gael] -Pffft! That is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life.. [Adum] -Didn't they say that you have to burn them? Like, is she dead or no? They said to burn them, right? [Scoot] -They said a lot of things. [Adum] -She's coming back alive? [Gael] -Oh he is gonna burn her. [Scoot] -Ohhhhhh there you go... [Gael] -She's really ignighting. [Adum] -Yeah, she's a drunk... She- she's... she's got a problem... So epic... [Gael] -What is this random last minute schlock? [Scoot] -Yeah, who's this fuckin' guy? [Adum] -Is he like breaking his ribs? [Scoot] -Oh he gave him canine hip dysplasia. [Gael] -Oh my God, he- [Adum] -AHHHHHHHHHHHH! [Adum laughing] [Scoot] -He's nude, right? He's canonically nude right now? His dick is out? [Gael] -I would like to know. [Scoot] -Dick is out. [Clip] -Why did you come? [Adum laughs hysterically] [Scoot] -Oh, she gave her the pain. [Adum] -Can you just like, leave him and never talk to him again? He is a fucking manipulator and she is an awful person. [Gael] -You know, you're being very judgmental.. [Adum] -I hope the last shot of this movie is Jacob saying marry me and she goes &quot;GASP&quot; and it cuts to Black. [Scoot] -Oh my God, that would be amazing! -This wasn't a choice between you and Jacob. [Adum] -&quot;This wasn't a choice.&quot; [Bella] -It was between who I should be and who I am. [Gael] -Okay... [Adum] -What?! [Gael] -That makes... [Adum] -What are you talking about?! [Gael] -very little sense... -Because, I'm not normal. [Music] I don't want to be. [Voice] -Bitches be like &quot;I... I... you... wow... I... bitch, what?&quot; &quot;speak... spit it the fuck out...&quot; [Scoot] -Yeah, I don't want to be just like EVERY other girl and fuck a dog. I wanna fuck a bat. [Adum] -All right, she's got a ring. She's got a ring everybody! We did it! Uh, she had it before we wanted to put it in her pocket, because she didn't want to offend Jacob, but- [Scoot] -She's still wearing her bracelet. [Adum] -She got it like, halfway through the fuckin' movie. But, now she's like real about it. [Scoot] -She's wearing the bracelet. [Adum] -That's the end of the movie, directed by David Slade. Great screenplay, great novel, thank you fuckin' Stephanie Meyer. What the fuck is wrong with you? So far, this one was my favorite. [Gael] -It's pretty good. [Adum] -I'm giving this one a three out of ten. We're getting one rating higher every single film. Yeah one two three. [Gael] -They just have to make seven more films. [Adum] -IMDb use a rating for the first film is 5.2, with a meta score of 56. The IMDb user rating for the second film is 4.7, so that's lower with a meta score of 44. So, that's lower... and then this film, the newest one Eclipse, uh the newest one that we've covered... 5.0 user rating higher than the second but not as high as the first, and then 58 meta score, the highest meta score so far. [Scoot] -Oh, the highest? [Adum] -Yeah, I'm agreeing with the Metascore on this one. Except I rated a three and not 58, but I'm agreeing that it's the best one so far. All right, let's check out some of these uh reviews... [laughing] [Adum] -Some of these clearly aren't Twilight fans... One of them says &quot;I have never craved a bullet in my head so much in my life.&quot; It was just the title of it. [laughter] [Adum] -What a review... &quot;the wife owes me big time.&quot; &quot;took my wife nearly a week of constant begging to take her to see the eclipse, &quot;after having endured the first two movies in the subsequent years of self therapy&quot; &quot;to erase the memory it took a lot of persuasion and to Guilt Trip me into seeing this one as well.&quot; Let's go for the 10 star reviews let's see what happens here... &quot;10 Stars very similar to the book&quot; [Laughter] [Gael] -Oh yes! [Adum] -&quot;David Slade did an amazing job regardless of what others say.&quot; &quot;I thought New Moon dragged on for most of the movie and peeked towards the end.&quot; &quot;Eclipse had me on the edge of my seat.&quot; &quot;Two hours went by quick and left me wanting more.&quot; [Adum] -Well, I agree! [Gael] -True. [Adum] -Ten Stars &quot;the best movie out of all three Twilight movies.&quot; I'm agreeing with the fans... What was your favorite scene? [Scoot] -I think when a man got his face punched into pieces... [Gael] -That's not.. that's not bad... [Scoot] -Because... [Scoot] -No one was really expecting that... [Gael] -by far was when they had the scenario where she was freezing cold... and she needed... [Scoot] -Oh yeah... That was the best... {Adum] -No no no no no. Mines a winner. [Scoot] -That was the best... [Adum] -Mine's a winner: my favorite scene is when she punched Jacob in the face and broke her hand. That was a really good scene. Come on, that's a winner... [Scoot] -Which was God's way of telling her that she shouldn't be punching Jacob... Fucking Jacob... [Adum] -wait we still got 77 but four seconds uh no we're all gonna die so you can follow me now! -No
