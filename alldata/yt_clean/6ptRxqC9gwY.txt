[tense music] [narrator] They're highly secretive. They have knowledge They operate clandestinely. And they practice ancient, They are secret societies. Are secret societies a hotbed of evil? They are certainly the subject They are accused of seeking to rule the world. Perhaps, as many claim, Time and again, people sense [chatter over radio] [narrator] But which of their suspicions and which are based on mere fiction, created by successful authors Secret fraternities have existed Their members Join us as we delve of secret societies. [suspenseful music] [narrator] Marian Fussel is a historian He is about to embark of the most influential and most secretive Hermann Schuttler, from Gotha, of the legendary Illuminati, a mysterious secret society Andreas Hensen, from Heidelberg, the ancient mysterious cults [sinister music] [narrator] An April night life for a young man He has been selected by its members to join a secret organization The order's initiation process is bizarre. -[eerie music] [narrator] The ritual and has been for the last 200 years. This secret society is based in Yale, in upmarket New Haven, Connecticut. [dramatic music] Marian Fussel has come to Yale where many How much truth is there surrounding the mysterious Anyone who studies in Yale But even experts puzzle [speaking in German] how does this fraternity In today's media society especially, where many people it's striking that so little its rituals, and also is membership. That is most unusual and, [narrator] The fraternity's activities The society's only goal, Every student would love because membership Anyone who is selected Leave the Harkness Tower tomorrow and go along the High Street, southwards. You must not carry metal, Take the right-hand book in your left hand Remember what you have heard here, [narrator] For a novice, He will become a member at the center of the wildest [eerie music] [suspenseful music] [narrator] Marian Fussel is familiar And now Alexandra Robbins [indistinct chatter] She herself studied in Yale. After graduating, she made and published a book on it. It took Robbins years to find out Her research was viewed with suspicion. [Robbins] I talked to more However, more than twice that many yelled at me or harassed me because they do not, and they are not, supposed to talk about I did get threats that made me both uncomfortable Why were they so protective [narrator] The &quot;Brotherhood of Death,&quot; shuts itself off completely Even so, The archives in Yale's university library contain documents from the early days The secret society is 180 years old. That much is certain. It is said to have built up a key position and established its members in party in industry, and in the secret service. Up until 1970 its index of members But since then, An entire panoply of secrets, and abstruse rituals the student who founded the society. [suspenseful music] Russell came from a wealthy family. In 1832, Russell studied in Germany was initiated into a student fraternity of which Skull and Bones was a branch. The numbers 3-2-2 are always They could be a reference Athenian orator Demosthenes. His rhetoric is legendary. Demosthenes died in the year 322 B.C. Alexandra Robbins knows more. She has brought Marian Fussel on the campus of the elite university, known as the &quot;Tomb.&quot; This is the headquarters The interior is said to contain [eerie music] [Robbins] The inside of the tomb It's almost like an obsession with death. And the reason they do that phrase in the tomb: Memento mori, They like to pretend that they are apart [narrator] Skull and Bones right from the start. Its members rise like George Walker Bush, for example. [narrator] When Bush contested it was a battle between two Bonesmen. You are both members of Skull and Bones, What does that tell us? Not much, because it's a secret. You were both in Skull and Bones, [Bush] It's so secret [narrator] Only rarely become public knowledge. Inside the &quot;Tomb,&quot; members are said which differs from ours by five minutes. It's believed that cutlery which once belonged to Adolf Hitler, [sinister music] The iron ring of silence is ideal With Matt Damon in the leading role, the manifold activities of Skull and Bones were portrayed in the film It tells of rounds of confessions Biographical details had to be shown in graphic detail. [dramatic music] It wasn't an accident. [narrator] No matter how insignificant, every detail of members' confessions They are the actual secret It is the fear of publication For the CIA, Skull and Bones is a wonderful reservoir That, at least, is what is claimed. Very few can free themselves So is psychological dependence one of the secret society's [Heiko Ernst speaking German] The boundaries between sects, between secret religious are becoming blurred. Naturally, by exposing personal secrets this society exerts power They know something. It's like secret knowledge with which they could damage wanted to leave, especially in anger. [narrator] Secret societies to what they regard as imperfect reality. And, they seek contact with power. They themselves strive to exercise it. Marian Fussel has come to the heart the world's super-power. For conspiracy theorists, Washington DC And it is not only Bonesmen who are found There, Skull and Bones is said to compete It was freemasons who laid And another fraternity is said in order to secretly rule the world. Conspiracy theorists claim is even immortalized The seal bears the words Novus ordo seclorum, Those words are also found So, is this secret society so powerful that it can print the symbols on the most important banknote [dramatic music] [narrator] Since 1862, the design has been in the hands And in all the years since then the appearance of the one-dollar bill Only the security features The United States five million of which Does a secret society as the supporters Marian Fussel has come to meet Professor Robert Hieronymus, an expert in symbolism Professor Hieronymus has made which differs [Fussel] ...a combination [narrator] It is full of strange signs [Hieronymus]...you'd need See this blue area, above the stripes? [narrator] The Eye of Providence, Thirteen stars above the eagle. Thirteen steps are said to correspond And last but not least: a tiny animal, All just pure coincidence? Benjamin Franklin was a great teacher And he had felt very strongly that he could teach what was important because everyone was handling it and would look at it [dramatic music] [narrator] Was Benjamin Franklin with the ominous secret society that uses the same symbols Marian Fussel wants to know more. Does a conspiracy really exist? Or is it merely a product of those who suspect a secret Fussel's research has brought him In it, the historian has found the owl on the American one-dollar bill. The owl was once revered a sinister order known Written in this mediaeval-looking font, is an ambigram: a word that reads Monstrous things are ascribed material that has been handled skillfully by successful authors But who actually were the Illuminati? They, too, had to take a vow of silence. They were forbidden to speak openly Here, too, different levels Not three as in the case but as many as thirteen. And a neophyte has to pass before he can be made privy The brethren are encouraged In this way, renegades Allegedly structured like a cadre party, focuses primarily on political intrigue [suspenseful music] [Fussel speaking in German] The Illuminati figuring in literature, the cinema, Some people even claim and clandestinely control politics, and various other fields. [narrator] The quiet town of Ingolstadt. This is where the legend of the Illuminati In the years leading up there was also foment in rural Bavaria. It was a time of radical change. People were seeking answers In Ingolstadt, Adam Weishaupt and practical philosophy. He was the only secular professor. His colleagues were all priests. Frustrated with Church dogma Weishaupt wanted to introduce change. -[explosion] [narrator] People's heads were filled But there was also great uncertainty Within a few years and even execute Louis XVI. Adam Weishaupt welcomed But he rejected violence. What he had in mind Weishaupt wanted to undermine And he sought to achieve this The first people he convinced were his students. His vision was of a state a concept totally in line [speaking in German] But professor, By force of arms? [speaking in German] No revolution! What matters is to tie the hands of evil, But that's impossible! By no means! The mighty of this world who will tirelessly pursue the grand plan [foreboding music] [narrator] Adam Weishaupt wanted to set up A monstrous idea even today. [Ernst speaking in German] Secret societies were also a melting pot for people who nurtured and who could express themselves without having to suffer persecution. People who could also discuss perhaps, on a small scale. That was a major motive [dramatic music] [narrator] In the troubled times secret societies also flourished and the newly founded Illuminati They set up countless lodges and attracted hundreds of new members, Their number included the most famous writer of his day, Philosopher Gottfried Herder, and influential educationalist The Illuminati were well aware of opposing absolute rulers. But they shared Weishaupt's Weishaupt was convinced of his idea. Above all, though, Self-opinionated, Weishaupt was seen With his fraternity, he wanted [speaking in German] The aim to a higher degree of purity [narrator] The supreme figure demanded absolute loyalty [dramatic piano music] [narrator] We know from their records the Illuminati operated in those days. Stored at Friedensstein Palace in Gotha, they provide valuable insights Perhaps Marian Fussel gave themselves Greek cover names, and why they introduced Historian Hermann Schuttler has deciphered A domineering character, for the ancient Athenians and their ideas. He valued their democratic principles. That is why he chose the Athenian owl It stood for wisdom. -[tense music continues] The Illuminati believed the dawn of a new era. And they wanted to participate In Ingolstadt, Weishaupt forged a plan But he was successful. He had tapped the pulse of the age. [Schuttler speaking in German] Change in society, in the Church, can only be achieved Thus, Weishaupt wanted to educate people. So his was an educational project But it would take time. Weishaupt said that 200 years before success was achieved, [narrator] The secret organization In its heyday, the Illuminati all of them high-ranking representatives Weishaupt specifically poached Despite its rich tradition, found their association dull. The new secret society [speaking in German] [clapping] [narrator] The lodges were run Like in Skull and Bones, members had to lay bare a requirement some were at odds with. [speaking in German] were very strict And many people were put off by this. Friedrich Schiller, for example, even though friends of his So sometimes the society also had this off-putting effect Someone with the status was not going to subordinate himself In a secret society, too, [wind howling] [narrator] The bigger and more influential the more resistance it faced. The absolutist rulers hit back. And those in power In 1785 one of the order's couriers when he was struck by lightning On his body, the police Only ten years after being founded, Membership now carried [dramatic music] Fearing for his life, Adam Weishaupt disguised as a craftsman. But, did this really mean If so, why do people That's perhaps because before he fled, Weishaupt succeeded He established contact in the United States. [speaking indistinctly in German] [narrator] Hermann Schuttler knows written to Benjamin Franklin. In them, the Illuminati to set up a colony in &quot;Elysium,&quot; But the old Illuminati records of what reaction the request received. The letters fuel What if a number of Illuminati to implement their ideas there? Would it not then have been possible for them to influence politics And, couldn't the Illuminati then on the American one-dollar banknote? No theory seems too abstruse. Marian Fussel has taken on which the owl is portrayed. The sacred animal of the Athenians and the identification symbol [dramatic music]] Printed in Roman numerals the year in which the Illuminati The Eye of Providence is a symbol which, allegedly, Novus Ordo Seclorum means In other words, it clearly states And why the number 13 The secret society I don't believe the secret societies to be able to rule Instead, you have corporate powers, trillions of dollars [narrator] The stance adopted Conspiracy theories are all nonsense. The symbols, they say, have a harmless, and nothing to do with the Illuminati. 1776, for example, was the year when the American Declaration But one thing is certain: the Illuminati Their founder, Adam Weishaupt, to undermine the ruling class But he wasn't alone in this. There were also the Rosicrucians. Back then they, too, But their meetings are said from those of the Illuminati. The Rosicrucians were said to possess and the potential [eerie music] [speaking in German] Brothers, Jesus means everything to me, the freedom of the Gospels, the glory of God. My brothers, let us begin. [narrator] The history can be traced back to a legend. [dramatic music] In the book Fama Fraternitatis, it is stated that the members had discovered the intact body His name: Christian Rosenkreuz. Legend has it Rosenkreuz was made privy [Fussel speaking in German] In reality, of course, But the character was cleverly chosen and goals of the Rosicrucian Order For every member is a kind of spur So it was well suited to join the Rosicrucian order. [bubbling] [narrator] In the early 17th Century wanted to free Society through diligent Bible study, and alchemy. In this epoch between mediaeval alchemy, the art of making gold, The Thirty Years War was brewing. People everywhere felt insecure. They were questioning Science offered This was the perfect [Ernst speaking in German] The alchemists tried to carry it over into the new world, They held firm to the belief a fifth state of matter, All those terms date back to the time [narrator] In the 17th Century proved more and more people appealing, not only in Germany including Cambridge, Teaching at Cambridge one of the fathers But he could not resist the lure [somber music] Newton's study in Trinity College During the day Newton engaged But at night he turned to alchemy, hoping to find the mysterious Secretly, this scientific genius was very taken by the ideas Later, Newton was made a member which had many Rosicrucians A Mecca of scientific rigor, has its headquarters No-one has any idea and alchemists who thought [dramatic music] Historian Marian Fussel on the history of the Rosicrucians. He has been promised the assistance Stored in a specially secured is a historical treasure: This brilliant thinker as a puzzle God left mankind to solve. For Newton, this involved and heavenly bodies but also ancient civilizations Simply everything, in fact. Newton, of course, we understand for his work on gravity So, we get very excited, It doesn't tell you very much but it tells you quite a bit about Newton. [narrator] Like the Rosicrucians, that divine mysteries The Rosicrucians even speculated by which immortality could be achieved. [dramatic music] In London, Marian Fussel what Newton wrote at Trinity College It's the legendary scientist's [mysterious music] Strange symbols, signs, Whether Newton himself is a matter of dispute. But his work shows how captivated he was [Fussel speaking in German] It is generally fascinating that someone who is seen as the epitome and the early Enlightenment should show as deep an interest as Isaac Newton. All in all, Newton seems dealing with alchemy than actual mathematical [dramatic music] [narrator] The Rosicrucians Since Newton's time the A.O.R., the Ancient Order of Rosicrucians, Today, it presents itself Elias Rubenstein is the Grand Master He cultivates the ancient traditions -[eerie music] Here in the temple, But what exactly do they engage in? The battle between the Church, science, So what or whom are modern-day [speaking in German] Let there be light. [speaking in German] [Rubenstein speaking in German] The goals of the Rosicrucians are simple: we are working for the freedom of mankind. Thus, Rosicrucian doctrine not just for some elite class. The basic issues we work with [solemn music] [narrator] At the end of a long road, an insight is gained into At one time, those in power At Schonbrunn Palace, is said to have met with the inner circle But there is also a dangerous side [eerie music] Esoteric sects have abused In the 1990s members committed mass suicide Over seventy people died. A suicide statement said: &quot;We shall return because Marian Fussel knows that the followers that their death merely meant The general public had no idea which had sealed itself off [Fussel speaking in German] Naturally, the concealment and mystery are also highly suitable They offer sect leaders in particular and of inveigling members they might perhaps not want to. In this respect secrecy It protects the society outwardly [suspenseful music] [narrator] Legend has it drew his secret knowledge of the ancient Egyptians, a civilization countless Does some secret key to knowledge In Egypt, well over 2000 years ago, traces of which are still visible today, The Mysteries of Isis and Osiris. The Nile is at the center of a saga that dates back After a long search, He had been drowned in the Nile Isis put all the body parts together again and magically breathed new life [dramatic music] Isis was a kind of &quot;super-woman&quot; And precisely that is the secret From Egypt it spread throughout even to far-off Germania. [eerie music] [narrator] The Isis cult was sensuous. So, often, women were also present This sensuousness was previously In the temple, novices After this purification, through the realm of the dead returning to Earth as divine creatures. Rebirth was a major theme, as it later was The Isis cult was appealing, Isis adherents throughout the Roman Empire. In Pompeii, they survived. Relics that have been found into the activities of the Isis cult. The mysterious import amongst the normally so prosaic Romans. [suspenseful music] [narrator] In Rome, Marian Fussel Hensen is an expert on ancient cults. Very little of the once pompous This marble foot The Egyptian goddess [Hensen speaking in German] The Isis cult It dealt with the question after death and the best way What is more, people were fascinated by symbols, they didn't really understand and by the exotic character In that respect the Romans [eerie music] [narrator] The Isis cult established Its success stemmed from the fact in an Isis temple, men and women quite astonishing Exotic origins, complex, there is no doubt that Isis, had just what it takes [eerie music] [narrator] People found solace They sought salvation The hope of a blessed life after death, [Ernst speaking German] people experienced something They became a new person. They assumed new characteristics. They belonged to a totally new circle. Their old life was left behind. Thus the ritual of rebirth, for example, and in other cults, secret societies [narrator] In the end, could not withstand [suspenseful music] In A.D. 354, all pagan cults From then on, Christianity was to be Yet one cultural legacy of Isis remains. Andreas Hensen has brought Marian Fussel which is decorated with freemason symbols. The image of Isis holding the infant Horus of the Virgin Mary The mystic ideas of Isis priests also survived the destruction [Fussel speaking in German] The ancient mystery cults often served as points of reference like the freemasons and the Illuminati, to extend their own history They clearly saw this as an important way If societies could refer that would, to certain degree, of their own project [solemn music] [narrator] Skull and Bones, freemasons, Isis disciples. Secret societies bear many names. For thousands of years, they have also been a part They operate in our midst, meeting needs They are surrounded which results being the biggest enigma of all. [suspenseful music] Marian Fussel from Gottingen. His aim is to reveal the true story The search for clues [tense music] Archaeologist Kate Raphael, from Israel. She is searching for vestiges Donald Ritchie, from Washington, that are hidden all over I, George Herbert Walker Bush... [narrator] [ominous music] In the venerable Church of St. Michael, the members of what is probably are celebrating a jubilee: 275 years ago, the freemasons The fraternity's elite have come For the first time, a camera has been Normally, such assemblies [mysterious music] World-wide there are In some countries members risk their lives when they meet. What kind of people are these freemasons and who have always been persecuted? What sort of knowledge And why is the outside world kept A hidden parallel world exists one with its own special symbols Historian Marian Fussel has spent He knows a great deal about [eerie music] Legends have centred because members must not disclose They have taken a vow of silence. Naturally, this provokes outsiders to come up with all kinds of suspicions So, it is hardly surprising the freemasons have been accused in all kinds of dark deeds. [narrator] Mozart belonged to the fraternity [tense music] But, so did Walt Disney... Jazz legend Louis Armstrong as was George Washington, one of the founding fathers What goes on behind the locked Is it really just a case of a good Many critics are convinced that in reality the strange rituals bear testimony Every freemason takes a vow of silence. Nothing must be leaked In the past, however, As a result, we are able A freemason begins his career Later he becomes a journeyman, and only after that is he elevated In the ceremonies to be reborn in the circle [speaking German] [narrator] But to the freemasons it is important [dramatic music] [speaking German] through your own will or efforts. You have to be selected. That's also the special status It's not like deciding to join a club. And this fact alone boosts a person's [mysterious music] [narrator] It's often a person's mentality to join a secret society: to belong to the elite, Frequently, Orders like the freemasons fulfil the dream of individuality [speaking German] [narrator] And candidates for the certainty The initiation rite binds each individual [man speaking German] So let the leaves fall [tense music] [narrator] London. The British capital is at the hub The Freemasons' Hall is home Marian Fussel has come which is regarded Will the historian find out more here He hopes for some answers According to Hamill's visiting card Everywhere Fussel sees objects and symbols which offer an insight John Hamill knows the legends surrounding The Internet is full The freemasons are said to have been The First World War is also on the list For a long time we ignored the outside world And we're delighted now, and we're back out being open with this building as open [dramatic music] [narrator] But if that's the case, not allowed to talk about And what role is played by the ancient which decorate the massive bronze door They show people constructing a building. The temple of the Freemasons' Hall pointing to the ancient roots In front of the Master's Chair The five points stand for wisdom, justice, Rectangular forms show which fundamentally regulates or so the freemasons believe. The temple is based the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem It, too, had pillars like those [dramatic music] Over eight metres high, flank the entrance The building was intended to express Jerusalem today. Are there any indications here as to why freemasons revere Our search leads us to where At one time the Temple of Solomon The Temple Mount is equally sacred Kate Raphael is one of Israel's She knows a great deal She also understands the importance [Kate] King Salomon's Temple in the first time the capitol So, it's the first time since, that Jewish people left the desert, and King Salomon's Temple for the first time build in stone. [mysterious music] [narrator] No other building is as steeped Its dimensions are described in the Bible. But that is the only source. Kate Raphael is about to descend Close to the Wailing Wall, [indistintic chattering] She and her colleagues which is so rich in history. She is convinced that down here of King Solomon's Temple before it was destroyed in 586 BC. But what made the building so special? Why do freemasons try to copy the edifice? As yet there are no answers Only a stone's throw archaeologists collect from the system of galleries It's the overburden from various Researchers know that each shovelful towards helping them to learn more about [adventure music] Every day they come across relics Gabriel Barkay is in charge of this exceptional treasure trove We have rich finds, which are even an arrowhead which was shot in the destruction We have seals, seal impressions, and even inscribed materials, so... We have enough material to, uh... to justify much activity upon [dramatic music] [narrator] The divine construction plan which makes the Temple of Solomon It is accessible to everyone, [adventure music] But it was others who brought [men yelling] [suspenseful music] In the early 11th century the Crusaders [man shouting] [narrator] and take possession Bloody battles were fought. In 1099, [yelling] The Crusaders were the first Europeans [weary music] No one knows what they sought divine knowledge or precious relics, perhaps? One thing is certain: by the Temple Mount and its history. So it was understandable in the founding of a new order. Its members called themselves and of the Temple of Solomon: The men took the vows of their order They promised to live in poverty, The Templars quickly developed They saw themselves as an elite, Soon no one knew the tunnels beneath the Temple Mount [tense music] Did the Templars discover from the Temple of Solomon or did the knights use the tunnels they had accumulated over time? [spades digging] [suspenseful music] Kate Raphael knows for the legendary treasure whatever that treasure relics, gold, perhaps, or as some suspect, the Holy Grail? Or perhaps it could be secret knowledge which the knights revered so much. The Templers were aware of the possibility that the treasures of the temple They ruled the temple mount for 80 years. They could have searched they came after them. But we have no evidence. We don't have archaeological evidence, we have no historical evidence and took it with them to Europe. [dramatic music] [narrator] As years the passed, the Templars became They did not feel accountable Back then the order acted just like major international The Knights Templar manufactured goods, and engaged in trade From the 12th century their network The Templars had become a confraternity, [ethereal music] The Knights' clandestine activities With their dark legend the Templars influenced like the freemasons. In London, the British Knights Templar Its circular interior is modelled on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre [mystical music] Temple Church was blessed personally [church bells ringing] Paris. For many years, the French capital of the Order of the Knights Templar. For centuries no one knew where Then, in 2011, a construction unit discovered the remains It was a world sensation! Prior to that only street signs of a society shrouded in mystery. In Paris, Marian Fussel hopes to find out between the Knights Templar His research has brought him [tense music] Stored here are original documents a historic treasure that could help Ghislain Brunel, has spent many years It is still seems astonishing that this mighty should have disappeared [indistinct chattering] [speaking German] for the trial of the Templars and for the persecution of the order are still the subject One possible reason Members of the order and retained their weapons So, they constituted a serious constituting a challenge to the king's [tense music] [narrator] But it was not only that was a thorn He, too, had his sights set And so, Philipp the Beautiful [ethereal music] -[yelling] At dawn on October the 13th, 1307, Philipp had his troops storm and arrest the knights. [man yelling] The day has gone down in history Since then "Friday the 13th" It was the beginning of a swift end For late mediaeval Europe with the sudden collapse The king wanted to eradicate [indistinct chattering] [narrator] Philipp the Beautiful that were supposed to justify his brutal course of action [Ghislain speaking French] In the initiation ritual the new Templar had to spit on the Cross three times Novices had to kiss on the naval, and on the buttocks. Homosexuality was one of the classical Ever since the third century, heretics had been accused of being in league with the Devil At their meetings, it was alleged the Templars worshipped [tense music] [narrator] These concocted accusations No one knew anything The general public was taken in In this case, meant the death penalty [yelling] In Paris, on March the 18th, 1314, the fraternity's last Grand Master, He never disclosed the secret -[people yelling] Rumours were rife. The Templars' ships, it was claimed, heading for an unknown destination Just a myth? Perhaps Jacques de Molay knew the truth The king had him burnt on damp willow: a particularly horrific punishment, [fire crackling] On that day, And yet numerous tales describe under a new guise. [weary music] After the order was smashed, found a new home in Scotland. Ever since then this country has been seen as a stronghold But is there any real proof that this is where Historian Marian Fussel is on his way on the west coast. Fussel believes [birds chirping] Will this expert on secret societies what happened And indeed, Ancient gravestones, knights in armour, and flowers: [Marian speaking German] A row of gravestones to the 14th and 15th centuries First and foremost, Some researchers that those laid to rest here that Templars came to Scotland and were buried here [narrator] If the knights found couldn't the order still Within their ranks the knights could well have handed down of the Temple of Solomon -[church bells ringing] Scarcely anyone has played than best-selling author Dan Brown. His novels and the screen adaptations Played by Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou, when they visit Rosslyn Chapel Dan Brown's leading characters So this is it: the gift at the end. [ethereal music] [Tom Hanks] Jewish, Christian, Egyptian, Masonic, pagan, Templar crosses, pyramids. [mysterious music] [narrator] Located near Edinburgh, a feature Dan Brown made skilful use of. He saw the chapel of religions and secret societies. Marian Fussel is also familiar It was commissioned who had the church decorated including statues of knights. The Lamb of God: a symbol found on many Fussel then spots two pillars He's seen them once before somewhere. The same pillars stand Marian Fussel has returned Obviously, at some time in the past, with their knowledge John Hamill is showing which testify to a fascination These include a compass and a square. [Marian speaking German] The origins of freemasonry a fact which leads time Modern research tends to see its origins in the Bauhutten movement In the environment and within this movement, structures developed [tranquil music] [narrator] In the Late Middle Ages, the members of the "Bauhutten" covered the entire continent like those in Chartres, Architects and the "Bauhutten" guild They had their own laws. Secret hand signs revealed and what rank they held. [solemn music] In England, these architects referred They moved from cathedral to cathedral, In those days ordinary folk So for them, the Gothic cathedrals built by the master stonemasons, were architectural miracles. The "Bauhutten" [Marian speaking German] These weren't simple masons an intellectual elite, in other words, who were at the very apex of society. This had nothing to do but people who had specific technical were also able to exercise [narrator] Does this mean in fact and ambitious architects got together? [tense music] Marian Fussel has received permission in the secret society's internal archives. They include the statutes and the founding document It points to a decisive transition. The document was signed in 1717, by a certain So, the first Grand Master but an educated figure from a comfortable The former craftsmen's association into a class-spanning fraternity. But why? What do lodge brethren experience What does this elitist circle, The freemasons sought the proximity For the individual this could well as the appeal of secrecy. [Marian speaking German] In the 18th century, freemasonry soon It became very attractive mainly because there was a great need to be able to freely exchange views to discuss issues of all kinds beyond The freemasons were able to satisfy this need for sociality [narrator] Close commercial links saw freemasonry In 1737, the first German lodge In Germany, too, the freemasons in monumental buildings, -[ominous music] But the authorities They suspected the freemasons King Frederick William demonized the freemasons. He feared the competition But not even the monarch from gaining a footing amongst the elite. At a secret meeting in Braunschweig, even the king's own son In the course of just one evening, the brethren elevated Frederick the Great, Was the inclusion of the elite part geared to gaining control of the world? Why else should the society to ensnare those with power? [Marian speaking German] how quickly the freemasons succeeded even from the highest echelons and in finding numerous supporters even among the most powerful figures So we are not talking simply even the nobility and ruling princes [narrator] Time and again, the freemasons were associated These rumours culminated in the bizarre mindscape The head of Hitler's SS and suspected that it was part Himmler reckoned that the freemasons and that through them, So, in January 1937, near the Alster lake [speaking German] Heil Hitler! You'd better be right! [narrator] Himmler felt totally justified The National Socialists as part of huge world conspiracy Members of the order in the temple in Hamburg But then, Being a freemason in the Third Reich [mysterious music] [speaking German] where the secret rituals took place. [narrator] the fraternity was believed to have kept, the Nazis had the freemasons' Himmler was obsessed He surrounded himself with diviners with the German Ancestral Heritage Society The freemasons did not fit in of the "Ancient Germanic Religion", which was to be used henceforth The Nazis didn't find any treasure but they did cause serious harm As long as they were in power, Professor Rudiger Templin As he heads for the lodge, he looks no different It's only inside the building that the brethren The apron has its origins It protected the stonemasons The top hat is an ancient symbol The white gloves represent [indistinct chattering] [Rudiger speaking German] The real secret of a person's character in freemasonry, That's something you need It's hard to describe. That is why the search for a secret [narrator] Is it this seclusion and engenders conspiracy theories? But why all the secrecy [mysterious music] The fact that the freemasons as they sometimes claim Is the capital of the world's also the centre of a secret world In scarcely any other city on our planet are secret fraternities Some presidents are known of several secret societies at once. Do the fraternities clandestinely determine the guidelines Marian Fussel has come to Washington, D.C. to gain an impression have infiltrated American politics. His first stop is the Capitol. He has arranged to meet Donald Ritchie, Ritchie knows the Capitol He tells his colleague who immortalized themselves Enthroned in the famous dome, is no less a figure The freemason, who here has ascended laid the Capitol's foundation stone. Key circles strove to emulate him. One third of the generals belonged to the secret order. [dramatic music] Throughout the Capitol Marian Fussel of the kind the freemasons also used. The heart of the world's super-power seems like a set-in-stone tribute Now, my great privilege and my honor... [narrator] Even today, on the same freemasons' Bible, on which George Washington The last president to be sworn in I, George Herbert Walker Bush... -So help me God. [applause] [narrator] But, in whose interest Does he serve the American people, [Heiko speaking German] Democratic power but the members of a secret society The presidency, too, One problem is that you almost need because of the various loyalties involved. With the oath of office and the scrupulous performance of duties. This can result in conflict with the objectives [narrator] There are three million The capital's biggest temple is located only a stone's throw The founding father of the United States, after whom the capital is named, Built by freemasons, near Washington, D.C. It's not only monumental buildings, is said to have been laid out in line drawn up by the freemasons. The lodge's brethren are believed to have immortalized [indistinct chattering] Historian Donald Ritchie But neither he nor Marian Fussel can see the most impressive symbols That is only possible from the air. From a satellite perspective what conspiracy theorists have detected. On the city map, they have identified and right angles, Did the fraternity really immortalize The Kiplinger Library is the oldest Here, historians are allowed to examine when the city was founded. It turns out that city planner was not a freemason. However, those who commissioned him And, they wanted clear, But we cannot say whether they directly like pentagrams and compasses. We have a great long history And it affects our politics, It doesn't surprise me at all and see something that perhaps, wasn't intended at all, [solemn music] [narrator] In 1982, the suspicion for reasons of self-discovery received fresh impetus after pedestrians in London Hanging from a nylon cord, The dead man came from Italy. [tense music] The trail led to Rome, to the Vatican. Roberto Calvi was the Pope's banker. His brief was to increase the church's Marian Fussel has good reasons Why had Roberto Calvi travelled to London Perhaps journalist Mario Guarino He followed the Calvi case for many years. That is how long the official They revealed that the Pope's banker Its name: Propaganda Due, But what was the nature [Mario speaking Italian] The P2 was a kind of parallel It didn't want Instead, the aim was to penetrate it, senators, businessmen and bankers. The P2 had control of the finances. Many banks were headed [solemn music] [narrator] Through his investigations, Initially, the Propaganda Due Then, it was infiltrated by criminals. The secret meetings were held In Italy, the lodge is notorious. Initially, the brethren [indistinct chattering] But in Calvi's day the lodge and become a dangerous network, Did ultra-right puppet-masters want to make Propaganda Due Backed by the United States, and a craving for money and power. [indistinct chattering] Later, in its judgement, that the men who met in the Excelsior Terror was to be used overheated atmosphere would then utilize for their own ends. [speaking Italian] Please... Roberto Calvi operated amongst who wanted to change Italy. [tense music] [narrator] In 1980, killed 85 people. [eerie music] Two years previously, the president Aldo Moro, Here, too, there were links Was the aim to pin the blame It's hard to work out what was really Propaganda Due remained shadowy. What is clear, however, and Mafiosi met here. They forged plans and did crooked deals. [indistinct chattering] Roberto Calvi wanted to profit The head of the Banco Ambrosiano was supposed to provide the Church to support the struggle [speaking Italian] Mr. Calvi. Investigators today suspect in Propaganda Due, in order to speculate. [speaking Italian] [narrator] The Mafia wanted its money back. Calvi realized too late and there was no getting out of it. Or was it merely that fascinated Roberto Calvi [Heiko speaking German] The suspicion also through trials, that criminal that criminal wheeling and dealing was also part of the activities that those who perhaps weren't criminals definitely planned to accept that they said: it wouldn't hurt especially in Italy where the Mafia has probably infiltrated [narrator] proved fatal for Roberto Calvi. His bank had outstanding debts In his desperation, He accused the Pontiff A few days later Roberto Calvi was dead, The Calvi murder trial ended But questions remain. The case shows that secret societies Propaganda Due was banned. But the proceedings had no effect even though they are often accused especially as no one knows for certain [Marian speaking German] From the point those who like to believe in the power such an acquittal changes nothing. Indeed, it generates even more suspicion So, there is actually no escape My belief is that, if organizations have any power at all, and not on their actual activities. [solemn music] [narrator] Secret societies They hold a mysterious appeal. But what are their real goals? Precisely what are they planning? We can only guess. Much can be explained. Yet for a long time to come people into the inner workings [suspenseful music] Marian Fussel from Gottingen the most fantastic conspiracy the possibility If that is true, are they being protected Daniel Ganser from Zurich He believes that we still have no idea behind the terrorist attacks Ulrich Walter from Munich that staff at NASA [radio voice] For 2,000 years, the Vatican and of secular dominion. [bell chimes] The focus here but also on influence and power. The Vatican is the subject A sensational secret is believed a secret that, were it to be revealed, would rock the world. It involves Jesus Christ. Located in the catacombs in Rome are the oldest depictions of Jesus. [bells chime] They show a young man a man who is said to have had a wife: Mary Magdalene. Verse 55 the companion of the Savior According to the manuscript, he loved her more and would often kiss her on the mouth. If that were true, would have to be re-written. So is the Vatican suppressing a truth that would undermine its power? The Da Vinci Code, made the story to a broader public. And the film certainly did. But how could Christ Mary was pregnant For her own safety, and for that of Christ's unborn child, she fled the Holy Land and came to France. And here, it is said, [baby screams] Sarah. [narrator] The south of France: this, then, are said to live: in our very midst, protected, by a secret fraternity. Marian Fussel is heading for the place where it all began: Rennes-le-Chateau. [dramatic music] This sleepy hamlet Many see this as an indication is the epicenter A remarkable church it seems totally out of place Terrifying creatures greet the visitor. Do the statues here or perhaps Mary Magdalene holding Christ's child? [in German] This small village, is steeped in legend. Its redevelopment along with the construction have given rise to questions The work must have consumed the question of where the money came from [birds chirping] [narrator] The incongruities surrounding when Father Berenger Sauniere took up office in Rennes-le-Chateau. At the time, the parish really was as poor Nevertheless, the priest soon embarked on the expensive conversion of his church. It wasn't long where Abbe Sauniere for his construction project. [suspenseful music] Marian Fussel sees the building project and the mysterious blood line as elements of a major conspiracy theory. Christian Doumergue He has examined and knows all the legends associated with Rennes-le-Chateau. [Doumergue speaking French] [Doumergue in French] went far beyond his means. It was clearly not his income as a priest that enabled him Back then that raised one or two questions It gave rise to the rumor that the he must have found some treasure. [narrator] And for a long time, was the source of much speculation. Was it cash? Valuable relics, perhaps? Or ancient documents proving, that Jesus had descendants? Sauniere is said to blackmail the Catholic Church into giving him hush money not to reveal the secret The figure at the center was Mary Magdalene. Leonardo da Vinci is said in his famous painting of the Last Supper. The claim is that it is not who is pictured to the left of Christ but Mary Magdalene. The legend that Jesus had a family His descendants were said to be protected Best-selling author Dan Brown plays The Da Vinci Code. Who are you? There have been many names: the keepers... ...guardians... ...the Priory of Sion. [narrator] Although the Priory of Sion its existence was not documented when French author Pierre Plantard Had he betrayed secret knowledge [dramatic music] The trail leads us to Paris is believed to have been active. The most important documents are kept in the French National Library. A venerable institution, what is stored here Religious scholar Frederic Lenoir is fascinated by the brotherhood and by the idea He has made a detailed study of the files. In his research a list of the grand masters catalogued as such The neatly typed list goes back to the time of Jesus. It includes such famous names as that of universal genius Legendary scientist and mathematician is also mentioned. One illustrious figure after another, but were they all really members [in French] When you look at the list that all the historical facts The dates are correct But you then realize could never have had anything to do Leonardo da Vinci, for instance, Here, reality has been mixed with fiction. [narrator] jumped at the blend It was the grain of reality But that's something the authors are also aware of. When they merge the two, it is hard to see the result [in French] What struck me in exactly the same way the ancient Greeks which still exist today. In the form of the Priory, a modern myth was created And that's quite extraordinary. [narrator] Doubts over the Priory of Sion that the list of grand masters It was passed and was only accepted A conclusive document exists in the form signed by Pierre Plantard... in 1956. So, as Plantard himself admitted The ancient brotherhood, dedicated never existed. Another theory also rests on an unsound footing. [dramatic music] In Rennes-le-Chateau why the priest Records he left show in &quot;intercessions for the deceased.&quot; Sauniere was a confidence trickster. [in German] The account books that that there was no treasure involved, But that did not affect the legend. People still suspected and went on searching for it. [narrator] It's astonishing with his scam for so long. How gullible his villagers were. [dramatic music] The legend continues to be spun out, for belief in such mysteries Marian Fussel has analyzed He has found that the more significant the more likely it is to be believed. Precisely what is involved [in German] Where the theory one individual, Plantard, That in itself is relatively harmless. But there are other conspiracy theories And those theories [narrator] That was also the case with the most sinister conspiracy theory the myth of a Jewish world conspiracy. In the first half of the 20th century the Jews were blamed for all ills. They were accused of wanting first of all with capitalist money Their alleged goal: global dominance. Wealthy Jewish entrepreneurs families like the Ballins... ...the Rothschilds... ...the Guggenheims... ...and the Astors. The Jews were painted as the enemy. [applause] [croud cheering] [narrator] an imaginary plot, begins in Prague, at a most unusual, indeed creepy location. Every 100 years leading Jews were said as the &quot;Elders of Zion,&quot; a Jewish shadow government whose alleged aim But the myth of this meeting, was to have dire consequences. In Berlin, was used to stir up hatred of the Jews. Marian Fussel wants to find out how this production of the imagination and why so many people He has come to the Jewish Museum in Berlin to meet historian Wolfgang Benz, an expert on anti-Semitism. Benz has made a close study levelled at Jews in the 20th century. [inaudible] The theory of a world conspiracy The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Virtually no other of the last century has wrought as much havoc With great skill, prejudices and enemy stereotypes. The defamatory propaganda draws people to support [Benz speaking German] Allegedly, every 100 years the Jewish elders meet at the cemetery to report on their progress in permeating But the report is headed &quot;Protocols&quot; of it being [narrator] The claim is that the protocols at the first Zionist World Congress But in reality the focus was The World Congress But he wasn't nurturing visions Herzl wanted to establish So why was the truth twisted? [in German] Minorities have always and made into enemy stereotypes. The end result in this case the Jews are evil. The Jews are a threat to non-Jews, the Jews want sovereignty of the world. [narrator] St. Petersburg. The true story of begins during the time [suspenseful music] Nowhere was hatred of the Jews than among the people More Jews lived in the Russian Empire Regarded as the enemies they were persecuted. [speaking Russian] [narrator] The head of Pyotr Rachkovsky, used the anti-Semitic mood in the country He wanted to pin the blame on the Jews. To achieve this all he had to do was discredit them even further. Rachkovsky needed a document that would enable him to defame the Jews. Since he didn't have one, Rachkovsky had one prepared [speaking Russian] Matvei Golovinski and disaster took its course. [speaking Russian] Can a specific group And why is this done? [Ernst speaking German] And those in power certainly do. They need scapegoats to conceal or to mobilize people Where conspiracy theories are concerned, this is taken to extremes. And the worst extreme based on Jews as a whole are stigmatized and made responsible [dramatic music] [narrator] Intelligence officer Golovinski in producing bogus press articles. But now he wrote for many years to come. He shamelessly plagiarized with reality. Entire passages were lifted word for word from the satirical French novel The Dialogue in Hell by Maurice Joly. Golovinski finished to indicate its authenticity, even though everything In the Russian Empire what was probably to appear in the 20th century was reprinted time and again. [explosive music] Within a few years, began their triumphal global advance. The mendacious pamphlet had its finger In the end, Golovinski's text was translated In Germany, too, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion dovetailed perfectly of the National Socialists. It was soon alleged But once a conspiracy has been exposed it is hard to allay all suspicions. [in German] The National Socialists as if it provided actual proof Ultimately, all anti-Semitic propaganda, the whole persecution of the Jews, [airplane engine sounds] [narrator] the &quot;Protocols&quot; Six million Jews before Nazi Germany capitulated. [inaudible] The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and the fall of the Third Reich. They continue to spread Marian Fussel re-discovered on the home page of Hamas, the radical Islamic movement. Its charter contains excerpts as if they were an authentic document [in German] Conspiracy theories in an extreme way. There are no shades of grey, One such conspiracy theory which is still in the heads Time and again it is used and for interpreting current events. [narrator] New York, the scene of events which saw in the spotlight once again. [airplane noise] [man] Holy shit! [narrator] When two aircrafts flew into on September the 11th, 2001, the world held its breath. More than 3,000 people died. [people screaming] [narrator] Pictures of the collapse burned themselves deep Millions of television viewers world-wide as the symbols of America's claim [unintelligible voices] [man] There it comes. [shots fired] [narrator] In the Islamist strongholds there was spontaneous jubilation. The United States of the existence of the state of Israel. In the eyes of many Moslems, had been pierced to the core. [car honking] The instigator was soon identified: Osama bin Laden, the head of the Al-Qaeda terror network. It was he who gave the order That, at least, is the official version. But soon after September the 11th, doubts were raised as to the accuracy of the government version of events. Marian Fussel in New York. Even today, many people, believe that they do not know No other event in recent times as September the 11th. Did the terrorists have allies Was the US government in order to justify invading Afghanistan Or was a totally different power [in German] The enormity of September 11th But at the same time Who was responsible So it was clear that people would fall back of conspiracy theories. [ambulance siren] [narrator] Once again, a Jewish conspiracy [screaming] This time, fanatical Islamists claimed, it was aimed at the Arab world. They saw a Jewish plot who had sacrificed in order to plunge the world into a war and thus serve their own ends. This argument bears a striking similarity to the Jewish world conspiracy as described in You wanna get farther away? [speaking Arabic] [narrator] In the wake of the attacks, a well-known cleric that the story of September the 11th is that of a Zionist conspiracy. [speaking Arabic] Marian Fussel Did the Israeli government not to go to work in the Twin Towers as one Syrian newspaper claimed? [knocking] Professor Bronner. -Hi. [narrator] is only too familiar He has studied the events Numerous Jews were also killed [speaking German] [in German] First of all there were who died in the attack. The second thing is that, the question would be And the argument was that Mossad... ...informed them... And that is because Mossad of every Jew in the world. Or the email address And therefore it was an easy task. One doesn't even know [narrator] the conspiracy theories still persist. Time and again sceptics discover like that of the missing aircraft. At 9:37 on September the 11th, a massive explosion shook the Pentagon. Even today some people refuse to believe that it was caused by the impact After all, they say, CCTV footage shows an explosion but no aircraft. Conspiracy expert Marian Fussel He knows But he doesn't regard it as plausible. [in German] that there was no plane crash, Because of its technology, only took intermittent pictures. So there are gaps in the recording. And because of the tremendous speed at which the plane it appeared in one of those gaps, So the camera Its recording technology alone does not show an aircraft. [narrator] The official that the terrorists Research is being carried out by a man who regards as incomplete. Peace researcher Daniele Ganser has analyzed the documents Ganser dismisses He sticks to the facts. And they, he says, speak for themselves. In his opinion, is that the official report blithely ignores one event: the collapse of the third tower. Very few people know which collapsed So, too, did World Trade Centre 7, immediately behind the towers. But it didn't crumble And it was never struck by an aircraft. Did its overheated steel girders Or was the building brought down And why did some television stations an hour too soon, Years later, is still the subject of speculation, and many questions remain unanswered. Only submitted in 2008, the report Daniele Ganser feels, is unsatisfactory. [Ganser in German] We still don't know When you study the video footage, That's because the upper three corners come down more or less in free fall, without any major resistance. Construction experts are convinced which gives rise to the question of whether we know precisely [narrator] The day before the attacks, unknown investors bet that the shares would plummet and they were right. The aircraft used in the attacks Someone with insider knowledge of the impending deaths must have earned themselves a fortune. [dramatic music] [Ganser speaking German] what was going to happen. After all, and not by elephants or giraffes. So some people knew To find out you have to approach But they refuse Two airplanes... [narrator] Is it possible that or, as some people claim, A monstrous allegation. But one that is not inconceivable. The US military itself In 1962, with a perfidious plan. Amongst other things, as it was known, recommended terrorist attacks and on civil air traffic. These would then be blamed Kennedy rejected the idea. [Fussel speaking German] in political power has been shaken, those in power lose all credibility. This happened during the Cold War was a deliberate policy. It led to a climate of insecurity, one in which conspiracy theories, because everything was questioned and credibility as a whole At such times, conspiracy theories hold center stage [dramatic music] [narrator] Mistrust of the government in American society. One of the best known conspiracy theories in the Nevada desert. On a summer's night in 1976, a man set out to expose what, at the time, was the pinnacle of American science as a cheap fabrication. [dramatic music] Bill Kaysing did not believe The whole mission, he said, was just technologically impossible. It was merely a political gambit Kaysing suspected was actually staged on the Earth. And he reckoned he could prove it. On that summer's night, [dramatic music] If Kaysing were right, the world would no longer be talking about but about the greatest deception On July 16, 1969, a Saturn Five rocket lifted off from the Kennedy Space Centre Its destination: the Moon. The mission was a global spectacle. World-wide, 500 million viewers on television. [radio chatter] In a bold speech given in September 1962, John F. Kennedy The US president was staking everything, because he knew that the plan was highly ambitious. We choose to go to the Moon in this decade not because they are easy, [applause] [narrator] because in the space field, the Americans were lagging years behind the Soviet Union. In 1957, the Soviets had launched a dog called Laika. Four years later, as the first human being in space. Gagarin made a complete orbit [Russian radio chatter] &quot;I see the Earth, it is so beautiful,&quot; Space seemed to belong to the Russians. NASA, however, had to cope and the tragic loss of human life. The Apollo program but the success, failed to materialize. In the psychology of the Cold War, this was a calamitous situation After all, two different political systems [Ernst in German] The Sputnik success who up to then had been world leaders, certainly leaders of the free world. A country that played a dominant role in all other areas, in fact, found that it was now lagging behind Consequently, to recover from its shock. It was about winning the battle a victory the Americans had to achieve [narrator] In July 1969, the decisive Apollo Eleven mission The goal: [dramatic music] Twelve minutes after lift-off, entered the Earth's orbit, hurtling through space at a speed The flight to the Moon took three days. The astronauts Then, Buzz Aldrin on to the dry Sea of Tranquillity. [radio chatter] [man 1 on radio] Four forward. -[man2] 30 seconds. [man 2] Engines stopped. [man 2] Houston, the Eagle has landed. [Houston answering] [Neil Armstring over radio] ...one giant leap for mankind. -[man 3] But that looks beautiful to me. [man 4] That's a good step. It's very pretty out here. Are you getting a pretty picture now, [narrator] A massive triumph. Or was it, in fact, Bill Kaysing was the first In 1976, he accused the government of having filmed the Moon landing He was convinced the photographs and footage, The flag, the footprints, nothing, he said, could have been And, in the Nevada desert, he intended to prove After all, the terrain in the desert is very similar to that on the Moon. [camera clicks] Bill Kaysing And indeed, the material he produced to that presented by NASA. So what is real, and what is fabrication? [camera clicks] [radio chatter] Was the triumphal return merely part of a gigantic deception? To pull it off, the US government and NASA would have had to act [siren] And if it had, astronauts Neil Armstrong, were wrongly celebrated as heroes. Marian Fussel has come to Munich to investigate the accusations and clear up matters 40 years after man, first landed on the Moon. In 1993, Ulrich Walter was himself an astronaut. He spent ten days in space carrying out scientific experiments. Today, Walter is Professor Month after month, all asking the same question: Did the Americans really land on the Moon? Even today, countless people still believe that they were duped even though NASA's film has been studied in great detail. [Walter speaking German] [Fussel in German] involving a faked lunar landing already received support in the 1970s, because of the Cold War climate and also through Watergate People could imagine the government, doing absolutely everything [narrator] Puzzle number one... Why are there no stars Puzzle number two... Why is there no crater to be seen under Puzzle number three... Why are the astronauts seen while the rest of the landing module Puzzle number four... Why is the American flag fluttering Those questions had already irritated In 1976, and earned a lot of money from it. What Kaysing began runs continuously through the story Conspiracy theorists time and again. But at the center of every dispute that were taken or taken elsewhere. Ulrich Walter knows every detail He believes he can refute The former astronaut is certain was totally bona fide. Even though many people might find on another celestial body [Walter speaking German] [Walter in German] are not visible on certain photographs. With a really bright motif So, since the light from the stars on some photographs [narrator] That's also why the astronaut The Moon's surface reflects sunlight. And what about the missing crater? [Walter] A crater can only be created if But the surface of the Moon and covered with a layer of dust roughly two centimeters thick. So when the module landed If the substrate hadn't been fairly firm, That's why there's no crater visible. [narrator] And why is the flag fluttering? [Walter speaking German] and stuck it in the ground. To drive it in firmly The shaking made the flag wave and this was interpreted [narrator] Marian Fussel does not doubt was genuine. It's something else that troubles him. The fact that this conspiracy theory despite all the arguments against it. Many people still find the Moon landing along with many other things, too. [Fussel in German] Conspiracy theories for as long as mankind is. That's because they have more to do than with what they know. They can't be refuted with because anyone prepared will not be put off, That is probably the true power the fact [narrator] In an age in which people fantasies involving an explanation are gratefully seized upon. Some people believe they are merely lied to by those whose structures the Church, No conspiracy theory is so far-fetched that it cannot be spread world-wide. In fact, the more far-fetched it is, the more likely
