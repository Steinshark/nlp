Mario Odyssey, but every moon makes Mario bigger and bigger. We're starting off smaller than a blade of grass, but later on, we're gonna be the size of literal planets. And also, as we get bigger, we're gonna unlock a load of brand new abilities. It looks like this ant has something important to say, maybe he could help us get a bit bigger. Hello, how are you doing? You are so tiny, take this size up moon so I can talk to you properly. Yeah this is embarrassing, me being smaller than an ant at the moment, give me that moon, big me up. Yeah, how big is this gonna make me? Oh! Hahaha! Did you see me just grow up there? I'm now the size of an ant! Let's go! Do you have anything else to say? That's better BIG Man! I'll give you another moon, if you battle that rat for the cookie! Wait, is there a rat around here? This is crazy by the way, I think we're in the Peach World. But we're just the size of grass! These goombas are massive! That toad's massive as well, and it looks like he's looking for me! What am I saying? Massive! Everyone's not massive, everyone's normal size! I'm just tiny, so everything looks massive! But here's this cookie, and here's this rat! I don't know what this ant wants me to do, cause I'm way smaller than this rat! He's like 20 times my size! I've got to save the cookie. Look at this. I'm like the same size as the chocolate chip. Alright. Get away, rat! I'll scare you off with Cappy. Yes, run away, run away! Keep on being a scaredy cat or a scaredy rat. Get out of here. I need that cookie. Oh! What?! You just exploded into a coin! Give me that rat coin. Hey! Let's check out what this ant has to say though, about us defeating that rat. Oh! Ooh! Hahaha! All the ants are having a big party on the cookie. I guess they're nibbling away at it. Hello. Oh! And he just gave me a moon! Nom nom! Thank you nom! Mario nom! Hey! Don't eat with your mouth open! Oh, but that's epic! They're all nibbling away at the cookie! Let's go, I'm gonna throw a cookie at him! Hahaha! We should be able to collect this moon now! And let's see how big this makes us! Awww rats! Nah, there's no more rats here anymore! Whoa! Hahaha! With the size of a cookie now, oh my gosh. Look how small those ants look compared to me. I could probably nom nom nom them all up. Ah! That's crazy. Oh! But it looks like we can make our way over to this Toad guy now. Come on, why can't I talk to you? Who's scaring you, Toad? Is it you? There we go, I can talk to him now. Let's go. Hello, Toad! Bowser's about to take Peach. You've gotta stop him. Oh no, I see him in his ship up there. Okay, we do have to stop him. Oh Bowser, what are you doing here? I can't have you taking Peach again. Look at ya! Don't be laughing at me. Oh, he's jumping down. Don't crush me! Look how small I am compared to him. Ha ha ha! Look at the size of you! Do you really think you're gonna defeat me? Oh yeah, and he's got Peach. Peach, we'll save you soon! I'm gonna take over the universe, with my special powers! What special powers does he have? Watch this! What? Wait, how big did he just grow himself? What? And now he's just disappeared into a wormhole? We need to stop him and get Peach back. Oh my gosh! Look at Toad! He looks gobsmacked. Are you okay? You're traumatized. Yikes! Did you see how big Bowser just got? You're never gonna defeat him. I will defeat him, of course I'll defeat him, Toad. I've got to save Peach. Well, if you have to, you need to get bigger. Yeah, I definitely do. I saw a rat take a moon into a tree. Wait, so one of the rats that was eating the cookie before, has nicked a moon and put it into a tree? Maybe through this mouse hole in the tree that we'll be able to sneak into, because we're extra small, we'll be able to go through like this. Oh, I see the moon glowing up there. Do you see that? So I should just be able to jump up and maybe the- Yes! There's a moon up here! Stuck in the tree! Wait, we are going to be stuck in the tree when we grow- grow up! Oh no! Am I gonna be okay? Did you see that bullet? Oh yeah yeah, there's a tank! Tank! Do you reckon you could shoot me out? I'm stuck here! Ha ha ha! Thank you, Mr. Tank! You broke me out of jail! You broke me out of my tree jail! And for that, I'm gonna thank you by... Stomping in your head. Get out of here. Hahahaha! Toad, what should I do now? That was awesome! But you're gonna need way more moons! Yeah, true! I'm guessing there's gonna be way more moons down this pipe for me though. This rainberry pipe. So let's enter it! And see where it takes me! Oh, it looks like that pipe's taking me to the Metro Kingdom, which is gonna be crazy, because New Donk City is full of moons! And it looks like we're back to normal size, you see I'm about the same size as this ballard thing. Which means that everything's gonna get crazier and crazier as we get bigger and bigger. City Man, do you have anything to say to me? The taxis have gone crazy! Something has to be done about this! Yeah, I can see them. They're looking all rusty. They're getting pushed around by the other taxis as well. Hello, Mr. Evil taxi. Hahaha! Oh My gosh! This looks so good. They're running at me. Oh stomp in the air. Stomp in the air. Hey! A spawning moon for us for defeating the evil taxi. It's gonna make us bigger. Nice! Just a load of dashes, but it should make me bigger. Let's go! Hey! That means I could probably just run into these other taxis. I'm so big. I could just kick them over. Haha! Oh no, I just crushed the lamp pole! Oh my gosh! Oh, can I hop on the scooter at this size? No! I'm crushing everything, I just crushed that car, I crushed the scooter. Can I crush this? Oh yeah, I can. This is actually quite satisfying. Oh, I knocked that over. Can I crush these letters? Yes I can. BONK! Wait, do you have something to say? Oh no! I stumbled on that person! Oh I'm sorry! Oh! I'm crushing everything, I can't control myself! Everything's getting destroyed! Bruh. Everything's just flattened like a pancake. Can I flatten these pole things? Oh, I can swing on them still, that's a massive swing, swing. Whoa! That sent me flying! That pole sent me flying! What?! Wait! I just got teleported to the sand world? Oh my gosh! Oh! Everything seems a lot smaller than normal, or maybe I'm just bigger. I'm just bigger, so I can do big long jumps across the desert at once. Oh, we're gonna be able to do so many trick jumps, that we can't normally do in this type. How did that hit me? That cactus was nowhere near me. What? Look at Mario's nose! His nose is bigger than his face! Bruh, this is so cursed. Desert man, Desert man, what's happening here? You gotta tell me! Harriet has stolen some of Bowser's growth formula. You need to get bigger to fight her. I do need to get bigger. Look how small I am. I've hidden a moon in the treasure chest. Wait, are you not gonna tell me where the treasure chest is? You can't just say there's a moon in the treasure chest and not tell me, man! I'm running around a lot faster than normal. I can do the impossible jump up here as well. Up to these arches. Where is that treasure chest though? We need to keep our eyes peeled. Maybe it's in this like little alcove area you see here? Nooo! It doesn't look like it. Brrr! Maybe in this poison area? Watch this jump by the way. Whoa! Pro skills. Maybe here? Nope. Maybe behind this building? Brrrrr! This would be a perfect spot to hide. Say if I was playing hide and seek as the massive Mario in the tiny sandy kingdom. Nope. It's so cool that I can cross the desert this fast. It's so OP. Oooh! I see. Oh! You saw nothing. As I was saying, I see where it is. All I have to do is- Bop! Open up the treasure chest, and collect the moon! And this will make me bigger! Big treasure! Now, this is tiny treasure! Do you see how small it is? Ayyy! Ayyy! We've grown up as well! Nice! Woah! I'm almost the size of these buildings here! I'm so much bigger than normal, this is crazy! But the sand guy was saying we have to fight Harriet, and Harriet normally appears on this pyramid... which might be quite tricky to get up to, but I might be able to do some parkour. Oh, I can jump up inside, but it's not letting me enter! Oh my gosh, am I trapped here? No, I can get out, I can get out. Maybe from jumping off this platform? From the top of the tower? Ohhhhhhhhhh! There's a slingshot! A sneaky slingshot, which I can throw Cappy onto like this. And there we go, now we're at the top of the pyramid. Harriet, you better be prepared, because I'm gonna beat you up! How big are you compared to normal? What are you doing? laughing at me? You're gonna go down! Ooh! Normally where that hexagon is, you see this hexagon that I'm standing in? Normally that's the size of the whole arena. Yeah, Harriet's way bigger than normal. Harriet's like the same size as me. How come I can't get some of this Bowser growth serum? I think that'd be helpful for defeating everyone like that. Ha ha! Oh, I also want to throw my hat at these spiky balls, so then I can hit her out of her hat early like that. There we go! Very nice! Get back, get back! Grab you into a corner and I'll line up, oh- line up ah ah, bruh! Oh the bombs explode so fast. I can't really do anything. I have to wait for a big bombs. Go on, plant your big bombs in the ground. There we go. That looks so boogy! There we go! yeah big bombs destroyed yourself. You played yourself. Ha ha! And she should only need one more hit now. What I'm excited for is getting to the point where the size of planets that's gonna be so crazy. go back, and then, bang! Yeah, hit your head. That was perfect angle, perfect timing. There we go. Defeated! You were so easy. I think I only took one hit of damage that whole time. Do I get a moon? Hey! I get a size moon. Let's go! Battle on the pyramid. Very nice. Is it going to make me bigger? Hey! It took a second to make me bigger, so I wasn't sure if it was going to make me bigger or not. Woah! Look how big I am compared to the rest of the sand kingdom. This is crazy. What was that? Wait, why is there a fish guy? Can I jump on him to defeat him? That'd be funny. Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! I'm trapped in his mouth! What's up? Come on! Come on! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Oh my goodness! I tried to defeat him but he ate me! Oh man. It looks like we're inside the fish now, and is that... is that the cap kingdom? Has the fish eaten the cap kingdom as well? Wait a sec, we gotta go check this out. Hopefully we don't get stuck down here. It looks like he's eaten the whole of the cap kingdom and Topper as well. That's so funny. Look how big I am compared to the Odyssey as well. I'm like twice the Odyssey's size. That's crazy. What? He's also eaten Plessie! What's up, Plessie? How you doing? A companion... After all these years! There's literally no escape from here! I've tried everything! Even battling Toppa up there, but he's too strong! What the heck, Plessie? How have you lost against Toppa? He's literally the easiest boss in the game. I'm gonna go beat him up right now to prove how bad Plessie is. There we go. I'm on top of the Toppa tower. Toppa, come at me. I'll try and stumble on your head. Ha ha! Wait, that just defeated him in one hit! What the heck? Haha! And then the Seismoon spawned. Play, yeah, I can reach that. There we go. Very nice. Toppa fish paste. Ah, we turned him into a fish paste. Let's go! Woah! Okay, that's made me so big. I'm about the same size as the top hat tower right now. This is crazy. I just destroy everything in the cat world. Aha! I'm destroying everything! I'm destroying the boxes. Oh, and I'm lighting up the little lamps. Look how bright they are. Oh, what? What's happened here? It's a big fish eating loads of burgers, and then it's like piled up. Maybe now with this size, we'll be able to climb out the fish. Plessie said we couldn't get out, but I reckon Plassy hasn't tried climbing up the burger pile yet. It's actually quite difficult to see where I am because I'm that big. How big are these burgers as well? If I'm about the same size as the top hat tower, these burgers must be the size of like a whole kingdom. Oh, and there's a bit of pizza as well. Let's jump on top of the pizza. Let's see if we can get out of this big fish, come on. Oh, yes, yes. Let's see where this is gonna take me. Oh my goodness, oh my goodness. I'm just popping out of this guy's mouth. Why'd you eat me? It looks like he's got something to say. Why'd you eat me, man? More burgers! You don't need any more burgers. You just ate like a 100. Oh, look at that old bird up there. I bet it will give a tasty power moon. You don't need any more power moons. You're bigger than me. You're big enough as it is. What old bird was he on about? Oooohh! He's on about this prehistoric-looking dinosaur bird. What are they called? Pterodactyls, pterodactyls I think they're called. He's glowing a lot, which probably means he's got a moon. Look at the size of the Cascade Kingdom now, I just realized that. Look at the Cascade Kingdom compared to the size of Mario. I could probably jump over the whole kingdom at once. Like that. Like that. Hehehe! First try. Come on pterodactyl man, I wanna be able to hit ya. Why can't I hit ya? Get up! There we go! I've hit the Pterodactyl and that's given me a moon! And it's just flying off into the distance. Yeah. Bye bye, Pterodactyl! Thank you for the moon though! If I can even reach it. Which I can! Yay! Pterodactyl takedown! Woah! Oh my gosh! Look at my size compared to the Cascade Kingdom now! I'm literally twice the size of an entire kingdom! Wait, who's talking? There's someone talking by the Odyssey. Oh! Ha ha ha! Look, there's a Toad! I remember seeing Toad at the start of this video and he was massive compared to Mario. Blimey Mario, you're massive! If you want to get even bigger, I saw a moon a mile up in the sky! Oh, is there a moon up in the sky? I didn't notice that, Toad. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I see it up by the moon. I reckon we're gonna get that big that we're gonna end up in outer space-scene. I saw an island poke out the water around here earlier as well, so hopefully we'll poke out again. There it is! Can I jump on it? Yes I can! I'm riding the platform all the way up! I just need to be careful not to slip off. Oh, is this gonna take us to space maybe? The Cascade Kingdom's getting tiny below me! And there we go! Here's the moon! Head for heights! Oh, I'm going to space! Oh my gosh, this looks sick! Look, I can see the whole curvature of the Earth and everything! I can see all the Mario Odyssey kingdoms, like I can see the Cap Kingdom there, I think that's the Cascade Kingdom, I think the Sand Kingdom, somewhere there. But this is crazy! I'm literally like the size of the Earth! I'm walking between continents right now! What on Earth? I'm walking through the clouds! I'm not as tall as the clouds yet, but I might be. I see a glowing spot here. Yeah, it's telling me to ground pound on it. When I ground pound on it, that might make me the size of clouds. Crushing the cap kingdom! Oh no, I think I just destroyed the cap kingdom. There we go! There we go, yes! We're now on the sides of clouds! I can breathe in the clouds. Mmm, very minty. Oh, look at the moon up there. The moon's actually quite close, you know. Oh, but it looks like there's a power moon on top of the normal moon. This looks like it's gonna be really difficult to bounce up to. At least we have lower, floatier gravity than normal. You know what? Since this is such a hard jump, do you wanna make a deal? If I make this jump, then you have to subscribe. Deal? Alright, okay. Let's see if I can do it. Also, whilst I do this jump, I want to give a huge shout out to anyone who subscribed in the last video. Subscribe, if you want a shout out in the next video as well. There we go. We're jumping off the moon. I really do appreciate anybody who subscribes, and it helps the channel out a ton. Anyway, we did make it on top of the moon, so you have to subscribe now. Hahaha! Let's collect this moon and grow a bit bigger. Get the moon on the moon. Oh, and it looks like there's another moon out there, right by the sun. Oh, since we're bigger now, we might have a bigger jump. Let's see if I can make it. Do a long jump. It's actually quite tight. Come on. There we go, yes! We got it, the Leap of Faith moon, by the sun. How big is this going to make me? Oh, what? Is that maybe tiny? Oh, well, I'm not actually that tiny. I'm still like the same size as the moon. That's pretty crazy. Let me stand next to the Earth real quick. See how- what? Wait, wait, wait, wait! I think I just kicked over the earth and there was a moon inside, that destroy everyone. What the heck! Oooops! Yeah, that's a bit of an understatement! Oops! At least, this made me bigger. I'm like the size of a planet now. That's crazy. Maybe these other planets will have moons in moon. Are you gonna have a moon in? That'd be funny. Wait, what? I just picked up the moon! I'm through the moon! Can I get Cappy to destroy them as well? Hey, give me a moon! Why aren't there no more moons in them? Wait, actually, I might have just killed everyone on earth. That's kind of bad. I'll think about that later. Can I destroy the sun? Cappy, destroy the sun for me! Oh. Oops! Wait a sec, what's this thing? It's sort of blending in with the rest of space. Oh! It's a spaceship, and there's a little space man, a little Toy Story alien sitting on it. What does he have to say? Hello. Hey! Stop breaking stuff! The power has gone to your head! If you need to get bigger, jump into the galaxy and take this moon and go find Bowser! Oh, thank you Mr. Alien for the moon! It's our moon! Yeah, there it is! Nice! Collect the size moon and this will upgrade me again. I guess I should get out of here because I've just destroyed half the galaxy, which probably isn't great. Hahaha! Should I destroy more? Maybe there'll be something for me inside of Jupiter. I'm literally bigger than Jupiter now, which is pretty crazy. Alright. Yeah, I'm gonna get out of here. Maybe if I go far enough, I'll be able to find a parallel universe where nothing's been destroyed. Oh, am I falling? I'm falling through the galaxy. What? This looks crazy. Am I gonna end up in a different galaxy? What the heck? Oh, where are we? This place looks beautiful, you know. Cappy's line, I definitely have stuff to do here, because I see Bowser's ship. What? Bowser's ship is way bigger than me. Am I like the size of stars right now? I'm bigger than stars, it looks like. Whoa. I should be big enough to approach Bowser on his ship now, though. There he is. He's looking so menacing up there. He is massive. He's like the size of the universe now. Don't stomp on me. He's still way bigger than me as well. Oh my goodness! What? How did you get here?!! Well, I collected enough moons to have become big enough to fight ya. And how are you nearly as big as me? I'm honestly nowhere near as big as him, but I'm not gonna lie, you could stomp me like an ant. It doesn't matter anyway, I control the universe now. How's he done that? So, I'm gonna bring you down to size! Oh yeah, and we still gotta save Peach. Peach looks so scared. How has Peach grown so big as well? Have they just been sharing growth serum? Why can't he give some to me? Oh no, he's so menacing. Am I gonna be able to beat him? Oh no, he's running away. He's running away. What? Were those birds? How the oh no, he's hit me. How are the birds this big and out of space? It doesn't make any sense. Ah, I don't think I could even use this cap. Can I? No, it would probably crush me. It's too big at the moment. Oh, no! I'm gonna see if I can just charge at him. Charge at him, he's weak. Come on. Oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! A moon spawned underneath him. Okay, is he trying to give me a size moon or something? Grow man, grow! True, I need to grow bigger, so I can actually defeat him! There we go! I'm back up to like a regular sort of size where I can probably fight him now and wear his hat! Come on, come on Bowser! Give me your hat! There we go! Let's go! I should be able to wear it now and charge at him! Oh no, he's throwing fire! Oh my gosh! This is probably burning up so many solar systems and stuff, destroying so many planets! There we go! Punch him! Punch him into the barrier! What are all the birds doing here though? There's loads of birds flying off! Come on, Bowser, I got to save Peach! Stop running away! Stop being a scaredy cat! Bruh! Bigger giant balls ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba Bye. One more hit, and that should be him. That should be me saving Peach. I'll rush at ya, Bowser. Oh, wait, there's another moon. There's another moon! I might be able to grow, if I can snap that from his tail. Never mind. He's got out the way. Gotta get bigger! Yes, yes, yes! Oh, I'm gonna be bigger than Bowser now, I think! So I'll be able to defeat him easy! There we go! Yes! Oh, his hat still damaged me! Come on. Give me that hat! Maybe it will give me a giant hat! It's just clipping into my head! That looks so funny! But I should be big enough now to defeat him easily! Stupid rocks! Get out of here! Get out of here! Bang, bang, bang, bang! It looks like I'm punching him now! Just gotta jump at the right time to get over him! Bang bang bang bang! Punch punch! That should be him defeated! Let's go! Get out of here! Give me Peach back! Have I gotten Peach back? Hello? Is there anyone here? Wait a sec! Is that the alien guy spaceship from before? Yeah yeah it is! Hello! How are you, man? That was awesome! You saved Peach! Yeah I did! And I see Peach right behind me! There! Oh. Hello, Peach! Oh I wanna go speak to you! How have you been? I was being captured by Bowser like? Wow Mario! You saved me! Again! You need to go on a diet, Mario! Oh... Oh and she's giving me a moon as well! Hopefully, that will return everything back to normal! Won't it just make me bigger though? I don't know, I'm gonna collect it anyway, because I like moons. Get back to normal? What? How is this gonna put me back to normal? Oh... Oh... Oh my gosh! No! Oh! What? She said that would put me back to normal but it's made me tiny again. Oh, I guess this is the new normal now. At least that means that the Earth is back now though. I guess if you enjoyed this video, you might also enjoy Mario Odyssey but with custom enemies. It's a super cool video where we fight a load of new custom enemies like Sonic, Pichu, Pac-Man, Kirby and so much more. You don't want to miss out on them. They've all got completely new move sets. It's so so cool. Click on screen to watch it now and I'll see you over in it. Bye! Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye. Bye!
