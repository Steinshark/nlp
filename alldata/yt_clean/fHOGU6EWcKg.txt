I can't believe you guys Well, it was your father's idea. Where is Dad? [Knocking on door] Professor Kaman? Yes. My name is May I speak with you Sure. No, but my daughter is in Rachel Whitaker. Ah Rachel. She's a pleasure Thank you. Professor Kaman, so direct but I'm concerned about what Is that so? [Pen dropping] Can you give me an example? Well, it seems your class with the subject of evolution. Yes it does. Can you explain to me Sure, but first let me are you a religious man? A religious man? Well you believe in God Yes sir I do. And does that help you? Help me? Does that help you to be Yes it does. Well then I think that's great and I would encourage you But you're teaching evolution. Mr. Whitaker, I teach what It comes from real people who and observed real evidence and frankly, But it goes against of everything we've been against what Christianity Dad. Hello Rachel. What are you I came by to talk But why? Well I just wanted to stop [Chair movement] Hello Rachel. Professor Kaman. Mr. Whitaker, I've got to meet so I'm afraid we're going to at another time. But I tell you what. You strongly believe in the creation story Yes, that's correct Every month the university that is also open to the public. My Department will be hosting Why don't you and I It would be a great opportunity They're moderated, Evolution versus Creationism. What do you say? No, I couldn't do that. I mean, I never intended to - Professor Kaman, Rachel, your father has that's what makes You can read off a prepared But, Dad you can't. Now wait a minute I did not come here of doing a debate with you. I understand Mr. Whitaker. It's just that I think so valuable for the students. And you do believe [Music] I can't believe Dad agreed Mom, you've got to stop this. The man cornered me Rachel. What was I You could have said no. This man obviously or anything But Professor Kaman doesn't Do you know how embarrassing I don't want to embarrass Dad, you're not going to convert so why even try? Actually, it's not his beliefs What's that supposed to mean? I feel this man That he's causing you That's ridiculous. Mom, say something. Honey, your father's just I can't believe And I'm certainly not happy is teaching you. [Music] Let's just go to dinner. [Music] [Phone ringing] Phil Jamison. &lt;i&gt;KAMAN: Marcus Kaman.&lt;/i&gt; Professor. Hey Phil, I think I've got How does evolution Ah ha, well unless I know what side We'll note it on It seems some of my views &lt;i&gt;JAMISON: Now who&lt;/i&gt; would challenge The father of one &lt;i&gt;JAMISON: The plot thickens.&lt;/i&gt; Yeah, I got a religious dad thinking for herself. I see. I might have to do just to build the crowd. Well, I got his name and number Yeah, no problem, Evan, got our topic and I think this one It seems the father is challenging Evolution versus Creationism. I wanna do a story on this prior to the debate There's the father's See what you can find out, what he hopes to accomplish. I'll get Shane to do with Professor Kaman. Okay sir, will do. Who knows, some community interest [Music] Whitaker? Before we begin today, I'd like to make a Each month the University at the Fine Arts Center and our department Yours truly will be taking part as it's a topic that is near evolution versus creationism. Now we have a slightly in that my debate opponent is the father of one Miss Rachel Whitaker. I don't doubt that Miss Whitaker a little embarrassing that she has my complete when she is beginning I just wanted the rest of you and I hope you're all planning as a part of your participation Okay? open your books [Music] We just left after dinner.

Can I talk to you Not right now, Is your father's name Stephen? I can't believe my father went and then like some gets into a discussion about I'm sorry you're so upset. I mean, do you have any idea how embarrassing this Rachel, I wouldn't be looking How would you like it was going to debate the most Put yourself in my shoes. I understand, but I don't necessarily think It's not like some sort of gospel I've gotta stop this. [Chair movement] [Phone ringing] It's Rachel. [Phone ringing] Rachel. &lt;i&gt;RACHEL: Hi Dad.&lt;/i&gt; I'm calling to ask you Rachel we were I am glad you called.

Did you talk to Oh no, I was getting Before you do, I think you should What? Professor Kaman was Front page story. We didn't run a story Yeah, well we did It appears our dear Professor got one of his colleagues What? Yeah, some instructor refused to teach evolution and Kaman got him ousted. It's all there. [Music] Oh and by the way, tell him I said good luck. [Music] &lt;i&gt;STEPHEN: Listen to what&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;it says&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;I picked up at the library.&lt;/i&gt; &quot;Humans came &quot;There is nothing supernatural of human beings.&quot; How can they say that I don't know but they are. [The phone rings] Stephen Whitaker. &lt;i&gt;EVAN: Mr. Whitaker.&lt;/i&gt; This is Evan Carlson, I am a student on staff and our editor wants to do about the upcoming debate. Would you be able Meet? Well I live about Yes, I know. I was thinking we could Can't we just take care of this I know Rachel sir I'm a Christian, I've got some information that but I'd rather talk to you [Birds chirping] &lt;i&gt;EVAN: Kaman is smart &lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He'll take what you say,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;question you, &lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;I've seen him debate before&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;STEPHEN: And I've never debated&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sounds like &lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;How&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;many&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;have &lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;EVAN: Normally not many,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but there will be&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;especially since&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He'll probably make all&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;STEPHEN: Much to Rachel's&lt;/i&gt; EVAN: &lt;i&gt;Plus&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;editor&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;running&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;which isn't normal,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and he is planning to contact&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;get&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;pretty&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;STEPHEN:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Great.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;EVAN: Look, I got some material&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;on&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;science&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; I'll give it to you. Thanks. We can sit here. You seem pretty serious Maybe you should be God didn't give me He gave it to you and I think Rachel sure doesn't. I found out something Twelve years ago at the involving Kaman and another Joseph G. Portland. Portland used to teach except for he taught creation. Kaman joined the didn't like it That's Portland's contact info. He lives nearby. Maybe you could Or even try He could offer I'll keep this in mind. And now I do have I'd need to ask you Sure. I think it's interesting I figured it was This place is very What do you mean? Let me show you something. [Music] This is about the spot. When Rachel we were spending and she was over I remember she was that she could throw Suddenly though, lying on the ground and just after she reached down a boy grabbed her hand I saw this from over there as he walked away and went Rachel of course was because she found it first and [Music continues] I then tried to use that I told her it was wrong for the and that stealing was a sin. But, I also pointed out have sinned against God In essence, we've stolen And the only one who can forgive Rachel seemed we prayed to and I believe that day [Music continues] That's great. [Music continues] Hard for me to believe someone to drift away from [Music] Let's go over and I'll answer those [Music] [Kimberly chopping veggies] Oh hey, It went well. Evan's a committed believer I need to make and then I'll tell you Okay. [Footsteps] [dialing] [phone ringing] Hello. &lt;i&gt;STEPHEN: Professor Portland?&lt;/i&gt; This is he. Hi, my name is Stephen Whitaker I'd like to speak What is this pertaining to? Well, first, and my daughter goes to the That's right I don't &lt;i&gt;STEPHEN: Yes sir, I know.&lt;/i&gt; The reason I am calling is from a Professor Kaman and I'm not interested having to do with the name But I have a debate scheduled on the subject of creation and I was hoping I said I'm not interested. [Music] [Music] Hello, Professor? [Music] Tyler, You might have to No. Well look, first of all, nobody goes to those You told me everyone went I wanted you to think that you know, with you studying Look, you saw how many I've been to a couple and they're lucky Listen Rach, nobody takes so if I were you But what you do need is our flag football party Stay in your dorm from now but that Saturday night, Okay? Okay? Okay. Good. Now, if it will make you call your Dad one more time. [Stephen's phone rings] Rachel? Dad, I am calling again to ask you to please not &lt;i&gt;STEPHEN: But Rachel.&lt;/i&gt; You debating Professor Kaman Rachel, honey, your Professor believes. I've been doing reading some of the reports This guy stands against Evan told me some things Evan? How do you know Evan? [Music] You went and met Gave him books, You're encouraging him? Hold on, first of all, since the editor assigned me And of course This is an opportunity My father is no match and you know it. Your father might do I don't know how I get myself &lt;i&gt;EVAN:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;answer&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;one.&lt;/i&gt; You let Kaman Professor Kaman who makes good points. No, Kaman's a who only makes it seem like Did he do the chicken Yes. &lt;i&gt;EVAN: And he said&lt;/i&gt; Then gave you some line and the fossil record. And what if he's correct? Rachel, think about it. Life comes from life. It doesn't come God created the chicken first, and then set it up so that life Kaman doesn't believe in God Come on Evan. You're not helping. Just answer me Did God create this world or did it come about through Evan. Just answer No. I'm not going to answer that. You just did. Just forget it. [Music] I just don't think I have on this subject. Stephen, you know enough, That's all you need to do. I don't know. This outline you've shown me A group of us from the church Thanks. Professor Kaman will probably get all of his students and I don't think are going to be [Music] [Car door slams] [Music continues] Hey. [Things sifting] Hey, I thought you were I have too much work to do. I'm going to the library. Maybe I can find a Rachel, not all with professor Kaman. Yeah? Cuz the only guy around here She's going through a Dude, just admit that you Yeah, we won't hold it I didn't guess wrong. She's interested! I just didn't expect this deal You're wasting your time.

That will be the night Then I'll let you know [Horse sounds] &lt;i&gt;PORTLAND: I don't know why&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;driving all the way out here,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;didn't I say&lt;/i&gt; Well sir, I thought the situation to you in person.

Just show up and get a C. What? Kaman's class. He'll give you a C if you just show up Didn't you ever I mean no other Maybe that's why he's the most Or the one with What do mean by that? He teaches his evolution lies to get students to doubt their So, you're saying You tell me. I mean, just the other day that God created the world. I know God created the world. Yeah. Committed to that truth? Then why are you all over your He's just never done anything You know why is it wants to take a stand and the next one doesn't? Why do some Christians and others don't? Maybe the difference lies in how Was it by addition What do you mean by that? It seems to me that a lot of to their life, You can't just add Jesus you must submit There's a big difference.

Thank you for coming. Professor Kaman. Hey Phil. That little paper of yours than I would have guessed. Yes, it's a good crowd. I see the visiting team has some followers Hey, we're ready to start so if you will take your place, Got it. [Crowd talking] Stephen Whitaker? Yes. Phil Jamison, Journalism, Thanks for coming. My wife Kimberly. It's a pleasure. Hi. We're ready to begin, so if you'll take your place we'll get started. Sure. Okay. People are praying for you. Hello, hello, hello. I'm Phil Jamison. I am the Professor of Journalism and I'd like to welcome which deals with the subject of What a great crowd, I'm a little nervous I can only imagine what our two It's my best line guys, [Crowd laughs]. Let me introduce to you On my left, speaking he has a daughter who attends Please give a warm welcome [Mild applause] And on my right, he is arguing on behalf he is from our please give a warm welcome [Strong applause] Okay, this is how this Both men will are going to give and then they'll be able to and after that, we going to open up this forum for your questions. Okay? Mister Whitaker, you are first, you may begin with Thank you. [Clears throat] Let me say first, that I've never done anything I do believe though is an important one and in fact, as I prepared for this debate that it's more important It seems that when as to how life came the theory of evolution has become the dominant that is taught in our across this great land of ours. Frankly, this amazes me. The first problem I immediately is not scientific in the since science deals with and reproduced Scientific claims only after they have The origin of life nor reproduced even though with their illustrations By definition then, can furnish no knowledge including the human race, If God did not create the A big bang that produced What caused it to go bang? A chemical reaction? What organized the original or whatever evolutionists to form life here on earth? And how did it create and design and intelligence? Nothing times something and yet, as I see it, that is the true definition of the universe and what are placing their trust in as The evolutionary world view as any theistic worldview. Not only is the an attack against first words of the Bible, God created the heaven but it is an undermining assault which really becomes At least when we're starting it seems that everything else That's it I guess Thank you. [Mild applause] Thank you Mister Whitaker. Professor Kaman, Well first I'd like to say very well done. You have debated before. You put forth some very In fact, I think if we were you might being in a nice [People laugh] I just had a few problems especially at the end there you can't prove any of it. Now I know you're going to say that it all has to be but that's always That's always the explanation. We know what faith is: And in case you haven't noticed, things don't always turn out The good guy doesn't always win. Wishful thinking and it cannot ever be proven. But, when it comes laboratory experimentation and have proven conclusively evolved from and what makes that so important is that it means that for life to form We are all descendants just as you and your cousins of a common grandmother. And through a process of descent that common ancestor gave rise that we see in the fossil record That is proof Mister Whitaker. That is scientific proof. Evolution means that Man and the oak tree, Life is about change in the strata And the clear progression evolving into more complex by every clear-thinking as irrefutable truth. Radiometric dating of the earth, shows it to be four point five and the rocks and fossils are millions That's a lot of time for change, That is time for evolution. Thank you. [Loud applause] Thank you Professor Kaman. You may both now question Mr. Whitaker? I guess my first question and the most important one I can think of is how do you Explain away? Yes, what about God? Simply put, man created God. Man created God? I am a hundred percent That man created God? Dr. Sigmund Freud brilliantly that man is riddled living as he does in a world and disaster with very little so yes, He postulated a being Kind of life that could pull him [Crowd laughs] Man also believed that from just about everybody to blow the big whistle until everybody got But most of all, and so he needed who could take him at the end that he decided all because he couldn't that eventually he was So, what's the purpose of life We live, and then we die That's it, Face the music Mister Whitaker. Elvis is dead, [Crowd laughs] In this life, we get a chance If we do that, maybe the next generation maybe we'll even but there is no afterlife. I believe there is much Yeah, you believe but do you have any proof Proof? Proof. Scientific proof, The Bibles says Faith in what? In a God we can't see I'd like a little I can't offer scientific proof. Well the words in this book how do you even know The Bible is very trustworthy. I didn't ask if it I asked if it was true. The Bible is the word of God. Wasn't the Bible Yes it was. Then how does that Look, I can't explain it. So, your betting on a book you can't explain I am sticking with Freud I am definitely &lt;i&gt;PORTLAND: Freud was wrong!&lt;/i&gt; [Audience move in seats] Freud was wrong. Excuse me sir. There will be a time later for &lt;i&gt;STEPHEN: It's okay.&lt;/i&gt; He's my friend and he's with me. [Audience mumbles] I decided to get back Mind if I take over Mr. Jamison, I would like for my friend here Well that's not how Is that acceptable to you Proceed. You never cease Of course you are going to agree since evolution leaves no room And since there is no God, and no one to whom But man didn't create God. Freud got that wrong. In fact, I would propose to you I believe that if man he would rather God did not Haven't you noticed, whenever anything goes bad or there is some people, religious almost inevitably blame God. How could God allow this, No, if man had his way, he would rather eliminate God, He even comes up with God is dead and [Crowd laughs] Sorry to be so rude My name is Joseph G. Portland, You see, twelve years ago, I was the one that taught Only I taught from that God is our Creator what I felt were evolutionary When Professor Kaman he got me fired I despised you Kaman. I blamed you Sadly for me, I let you take me You're talking about how those laboratory that living organisms evolved as proof of a naturalistic This is just not so. Those experiments only showed could be formed from and intelligence was since someone had to conduct Certainly that's far from And you know that contained in the nucleus shows that it could not have and that it must have You know the fossil record does not show the of one kind of and that no one one kind of plant or animal changing into another Dogs change into but they are always dogs. And we can breed dogs but they never turn because they remain that God created for them And you know that there used to calculate the age of the so why are you misleading The earth is not billions The earth is not millions You see, the Professor and bore you with Whatever he says, I have a rebuttal We could go outside right now and form the words in the sky and the evolutionists would blame it [Crowd laughs] To me, the most troubling is that in our society today, evolution is being taught in across this land But no one can scientifically just as no one can that God created the world, since none of us were present Both of these teachings then The evolutionist has nothing random chance events, and the ever-changing to base his worldview upon. While the one who holds to firmly rooted in the truths and a personal God I loved this university. I loved teaching my students. But one thing got in my way. Led to my downfall. It wasn't until I was visited that I came to realize it. And it was not you Marcus. I blamed you, It was me and my pride. I was the one who was not in what I was teaching I should have taught to look at both sides realizing that has to make their own choice. Either you are going to look or God's word. So if evolution, If God, then serve the Lord. We can't prove we can only present theories. You can chance your eternity on the views of Freud I'm putting my trust who died on the cross was buried and rose again I know some of you I am calling it humility. And I will trust and wait on the hope of May you find that same hope. [Music continues] Marcus, I'm sorry and I held bitterness I hope you can find it [Music continues] Professor Kaman. Is there anything [Music continues] Okay, that concludes Our next debate will be presented by with a discussion about We hope to see you then. Thanks for coming.
