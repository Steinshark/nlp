&gt;&gt; Jane fonda has been a movie star for more than half a century, but when I ran a clip from one of her most celebrated films, 1981's golden pond, in which she co start with her father, Henry fonda, I was surprised by her reaction. &gt;&gt; It seems that you and me have been mad at each other for so long. &gt;&gt; I did not know we were mad, I just thought we did not like each other. &gt;&gt; I want to be your friend. &gt;&gt; This means you will come around more often, unlike your mother? &gt;&gt; I will come around more often. &gt;&gt; You did not watch that scene, why not? &gt;&gt; Because it makes me cry. I miss my dad so much. &gt;&gt; That scene felt like more than a scene in a movie. &gt;&gt; It was. &gt;&gt; You know, I love my dad and admire him. He was quite a bit like Norman, removed, not able to express -- he always liked to do things that were rehearsed a lot. I purposely did something that had not been rehearsed because I wanted him to be surprised. When I said, I want to be your friend and touch this arm, we had not rehearsed that. And he flinches, and he ducked his head and puts his hand like this, but I saw that he was emotional. It's funny for an acted that does not want to be seen as a emotional, but he was terrified of emotions. That meant a lot to me. I went to his house, wanted to talk to him about the scene, because I had a hard time with the scene. It was so personal that when we actually got there to do it, I totally dried up. It was like an actor's worst nightmare, and I asked them afterwards at dinner, has that ever happened to? No, no, that's it. I could not get into -- &gt;&gt; How was it to love this man, and for him, it's part of Hollywood lore, we all read about, he was so emotionally beholden. I would think that would be tough. &gt;&gt; Well, it is. It is very common, especially for women my age, or boys and girls my age, not just women, whose fathers were of that generation, and especially mid-western. There was a certain attitude, like, you don't ever ask anything, don't express need, and you stifle your emotions. Of course, when a figure of your love is withholding and repressed, it has an impact on a kid and their relationships after they grow up. I've been married three times. I did not have a good hand that to me when it comes to relationships. &gt;&gt; We were both crazy enough, potion off to follow our famous fathers into their professions. Did you resolve things with your father before the end of his life? &gt;&gt; That movie on golden pond was kind of like a resolution, in a way. My being able to say that to him in the scene, and he died five months later, and before he died, I was able to tell him that I loved him -- the I forgave him for whatever it did not happen, and I hope that he would forgive me for not being a better daughter. I got to say that to him. He did not say anything, but he wept, and I had never seen that before. I never seen my father breakdown in front of me. It was powerful. &gt;&gt; I have to say, I think it's one of the greatest gifts. I had a challenging relationship with my dad at various points, and he lived long enough that we made it up and became best friends. I always felt that was such a gift because I cannot imagine going through life after it's too late and not having that resolved. &gt;&gt; It's so important to try to clear everything up before you go. I am not scared of dying, are you? &gt;&gt; I am not looking forward to it. &gt;&gt; I am. It's an adventure. I don't want to go, I still have a lot to do, but if I discovered that I had cancer again, and there was nothing I could do, I would be okay with it. What I am really scared of is getting to the end of life with a lot of regrets, when there is no time to do anything about it. It's one reason that I try to -- I am trying to get it all done before I come to the end. &gt;&gt; But do you have regrets? I would think that you would be somebody that feels pretty good about -- &gt;&gt; I have very few regrets. I was not the kind of mother that I wished I had been to my children, but I have great, great children, talented, smart, and I just did not know how to do it. You know, I have an organization in Georgia that deals with adolescents, and I studied parenting. I know what it is supposed to be no. I did not know than. I am trying to show up now. &gt;&gt; Jane, I got to say, this is quite a conversation we're having here. This is real, which is exactly what I am looking for. &gt;&gt; I hate parties. I hate cocktail parties. I always end up finding one person that is interesting and sitting and a corner all night. Do you do the? &gt;&gt; I know what you're saying. &gt;&gt; Because I am shy, basically. Just small talk, I can't do it, isn't that boring? &gt;&gt; I want to ask you a couple of other questions. As you say, you were married three times to three very different men. French film director Roger -- Tom Hayden, the anti war activists and of course, Tom Warner, who created CNN. You set much of your life, you turned two men for guidance and validation, is that because you did not get it from you that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I suppose, and the fact that my mother killed herself when I was 12. You know, I just assumed that nobody would be interesting and knowing me unless I was with a man who is interesting, and they were all interesting. &gt;&gt; When did that change for you, when did you realize that, one, I, Jane fonda is interesting and, to, I don't need a man? &gt;&gt; When Ted turner and I split in 2000, started a new century on my own, and I kind of thought, oh, I am single and I
