Bonjour everyone! I'm Alain, coming to you from Paris! And today, I'm here to solve one of the biggest dilemmas travelers face when visiting the City of Light: what souvenirs should you bring back home? Forget the cheap trinkets sold by street vendors! Today we're diving into 12 souvenirs that are not only uniquely Parisian but also genuinely useful. Whether you're shopping for yourself or for friends and family, these are items that will bring a little piece of Paris into everyday life Let's jump in! Our first stop is the iconic Le Bon Marche, and specifically its incredible food store, La Grande Epicerie de Paris. This is a paradise for food lovers, and one item you absolutely cannot miss is the Angelina Hot Chocolate Mix. If you've had the pleasure of sipping Angelina's legendary hot chocolate here in Paris, you know it's unlike anything else--rich, velvety, and decadently Parisian. Now, imagine recreating that experience in your own home! This mix is easy to pack, makes a thoughtful gift, and will transport you straight back to the heart of Paris with every sip. A must-have for anyone who wants to take a little of Paris' warmth and charm back with them! And while you're there, be sure to explore your surroundings You're bound to discover plenty of other culinary treasures you'll definitely want to take home! For example, "Confiture Parisienne", exquisite jams crafted in small batches using traditional methods. These are cooked in copper cauldrons right in the heart of the 12th arrondissement of Paris, making them a truly authentic Parisian treat. You'll be spoiled for choice with their incredible selection of flavors. Now, let's go to the beautiful medieval neighborhood of Le Marais Widely regarded as a genius of flavors and one of the best chocolatiers in the world, Jacques Genin is undoubtedly the go-to destination for exquisite chocolates to bring back home. The atmosphere in his boutique in Le Marais is truly unique, feeling more like an elegant jewelry store than a typical chocolate shop. This refined and sophisticated ambiance is unmistakable--and it's reflected in the prices, which undoubtedly sit at the higher end of the spectrum! Yet, the rhubarb fruit jelly and the chocolate orangettes that I bought here were simply out of this world! Paris is home to dozens of exceptional chocolatiers, but taking home some delights from Jacques Genin might just be the best decision you'll make. Let's head just a few blocks away from Jacques Genin's boutique! On the magnificent Place des Vosges, under the arcades, is Carette, both a restaurant and a tea-room. Yet, for me, Carette stands out as an exceptional macaron maker above all. Their mastery in crafting these delicate treats elevates the macaron experience to a level of unparalleled delight. Their mastery in crafting these delicate treats elevates the macaron experience to a level of unparalleled delight. So, if you want to impress your friends with macarons that, unlike those from Laduree or Pierre Herme, are exclusively found in Paris, head to Carette! While you're still in Le Marais and we're indulging in the food section of this list, why not pick up some exceptional French cheese to take home? Yes, cheese! At the renowned Fromagerie Laurent Dubois, they'll expertly package your selected cheeses in vacuum-sealed bags, ensuring they travel safely in your luggage. It's the perfect way to bring a taste of France back with you! A Meilleur Ouvrier de France (MOF) is a prestigious title awarded to the best craftsmen in their field in France. For the final two food picks in our souvenir selection, let's head to Saint-Germain-des-Pres and explore yet another Meilleur Ouvrier de France shop. Primarily known as a chocolatier, Georges Larnicol has won my heart with its kouignettes! These are the famous kouignettes! They are in fact small kouign-amann, a sweet Britanny cake made with laminated dough containing layers of butter and incorporated sugar. While the macarons here are good, my preference leans towards those of Carette, as we've already discovered. Of course, chocolates crafted by a Meilleur Ouvrier de France are undeniably excellent. But, here again, for this specific list, I'd rather go for those of Jacques Genin. I must admit, these Christmas decorations in chocolate are absolutely cute. There's a saying in France that goes: &quot;5 minutes in the mouth, 5 years on the hips.&quot; While in Saint-Germain, be sure to visit Mariage Freres, the esteemed tea company. Founded in 1854, Mariage Freres is a luxurious tea house, widely regarded as the most prestigious tea house in the world. Its tea menu features an extensive selection of over 650 blends sourced from 36 tea-producing countries, covering a very diverse range of tea varieties. Their best-seller tea is called Marco Polo: I must have a very common taste as it's also one of my favorite teas! I'm confident you'll find something here to bring home or gift to your friends and family--a little taste of Paris! While you're still in Saint-Germain, don't miss the chance to visit the iconic bookstalls lining the Seine river. Books, old postcards, magazines, Art Deco posters... these stalls are brimming with thousands of vintage treasures. Who knows--you might just uncover your own hidden gem! Another fantastic souvenir idea is to have a portrait made of yourself or your companions! Head to Place du Tertre in Montmartre, where talented street artists capture the charm of the moment, ...or find a portrait artist near the Eiffel Tower for a truly Parisian keepsake. It's a unique and personal way to commemorate your trip! For a beautifully scented and long-lasting reminder of Paris, visit the famous Parisian house Diptyque in the 1st arrondissement. Their luxurious candles, with fragrances inspired by French landscapes and traditions, make for an elegant souvenir or a unique gift for loved ones. It's a piece of Parisian sophistication that will brighten any home. Today, Diptyque boasts nearly 50 fragrances. I'm sure you'll find the one that suites you! You can even create a personalized ambiance by layering two scents of your choice to craft something uniquely yours. For a truly unique and personal souvenir, consider creating your own custom-made perfume at Stephanie de Bruijn's boutique. Located in the 6th arrondissement, this exclusive experience lets you design a scent that's entirely your own. There, with the Creator, you can choose a couture perfume--starting with an existing base and customizing it to your liking--for EUR250 per 100 ml. Or, for the ultimate indulgence, collaborate directly with Stephanie to craft a completely bespoke fragrance for EUR830 per 100 ml. Just remember, appointments are required for this one-of-a-kind experience! For those who still want to take home classic Parisian souvenirs like an Eiffel Tower keyring, a cap, a pen, or similar items, I recommend heading to Par'Ici on Rue Mouffetard in the Latin Quarter. Here, you'll find quality products, many of which are even Made in France, rather than mass-produced imports. It's the perfect spot to pick up authentic keepsakes that truly represent Paris.
