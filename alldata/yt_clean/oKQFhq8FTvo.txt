Well, we're waiting, we have to wait for the gray one So, what's the plan? In general, so we understand, we're setting up 30 mines, stretching the net. Let the storm command, we'll get as close to the edge of the minefield as possible. If the car gets blown up, we'll go here on foot, well, there might be no connection. So if anything happens, let me know, okay? You went there, and if something happens, we'll walk on foot. Alright, let's go. You have a job... - Only the front edge. In the 1-2 line, you could say we're stretching it, that depends on what task was assigned. Well, to ensure the enemy doesn't advance, typically to eliminate the enemy, surveillance 24/7 we're watching them, they're watching us, but still, we try to do everything to be less visible to them. We choose the time, the weather. How about today? - Today you could say is more or less okay, there's a bit of fog, it's getting gray. It's possible to work. This is our Baba Yaga returning... Where do you see her? Yes. The farthest one behind that pole. So far, everything is according to plan? - Yes, everything is working fine. What are you doing, anyway? Are they activated? Not yet, we need to turn them on, adjust the detonators, arm them, bury them, and mask them so that the enemy doesn't discover where they are located. Minefields. One mine TM62M, fully equipped, weighs 10 and a half kilograms. - And you carry 4 at a time. - Yes, so I can easily carry 40 kilograms. What is that? Detonators for mines. I'm equipping the mines with detonators. We are preparing for installation in the ground. When it is buried, it will already be in combat mode, right now it's just preparation. How did you become a sapper? - I've been in the brigade since 2020, and I haven't changed my position once. I started getting involved more seriously. During 2022 in the city of Popasna. That's when my, let's say, service began. But I'll say this: this job is not for everyone, because many fear it. To be honest, I'm a bit scared right now, I'm telling you. How can I put this right? This is far from the front line. We perform tasks both at zero and at the first line. So it's a bit easier here, you can still drink coffee here. What's that sound? That's probably a mine 120. Because this area attracts them the most for shelling. This area is shot at very frequently, so now is the time when mornings are particularly active, and then closer to noon, they seem to take a break, and here the situation becomes quieter. It's really great when the weather conditions are bad, like when it's raining, and the weather is heading towards snowfalls; that's typical sapper work. So if it's raining, there are specific units that don't go out; they can't work, but it's our job in the fog. It's just wonderful because nothing is flying, you don't have to look up; you can work peacefully. You can really focus on your work without anything distracting you. There are no factors at all. Because there's nothing that can stress or tense you up. Something like that. Please tell me, what's making that noise? What's happening? It's the mechanism of the MWC MWC. Often we carry the MWC with us, well, so that it's safer; it's better to screw it in. After that sound, does it? When it stops buzzing, let's say, then it becomes active for combat. Oh, there are a million dangerous situations. It's every outing. It's a dangerous situation, and there are also absurd situations. It all depends primarily on you and whether you adhere to the rules at all... There are certain rules that every sapper must follow because we experience accidents. It's because of carelessness, careless handling. There are also inexperienced people, and they immediately take on some specific task. The third factor is the roads. And so, about that... - Where are they shooting like that, is it some kind of landing? - They are shooting over there, there are landings. Like that, our guys were working there recently too. They probably noticed it already. Well, they send greetings in such ways. That is, for example, if it's an open field, like here, there's nothing. Then literally in a week's time, some engineering obstacles appear, and that starts to interest them very much, because engineers they, well, how should I put it correctly, really want to kill, because we create many obstacles for them that stop them in that direction and delay them. This is thanks to these mines, barbed wire, entanglements, and so on, and regarding concussions, well... As for that, I simply don't count them. Our combat medic... This is an FPV drone... He said that I have about 7 concussions in that area, but I don't dwell on that. About 7 of what? - On some injuries, or something else, it doesn't affect me much, on the contrary, it's more about the loss in the unit, when you lose your comrades. If you work like today, you work, you work, and then the groups split, and I came home and they say, that one is gone, that one is 300. That one is 200, for me, well personally for me, it carries a heavy weight, it's all hard to bear. Although I relate to death like this... if they kill, then they kill... I've come to terms, I don't worry about this. As for injuries, the most there was probably during the assaults in the Toretsk direction, we were standing there, so there was a lot of adrenaline, the sapper's work when the sapper leads the assault group and he goes first. It's very interesting, I don't know, well, many don't agree with this. Well, it's clear that you are the first target because you go first; on the second point, usually, not always are the sappers coordinated with the assault troops, meaning they don't know my tactics, my movements. So I don't know what I will do, and similarly, I don't know their actions. So how they will cover? Well, what is really interesting is that... that they depend on me, and I depend on them. So, with them, I have to go, to control the entire route, so that there's nothing there. So the assault groups can reach the destination intact, their task is to provide me with protection so that I can bring them to the target. That's probably the most interesting part of the sapper's work, it's the assault. It's crazy there... Cover the retreat... Ready? Quiet, it's falling... Well, good thing we hid. It's Grad... And, as a rule, you see, some equipment arrives and they start to bombard, which indicates that there is some drone that is monitoring this, well not right here, but its visibility of the road is good. So it can monitor, keep an eye on us. - It can see us too? - It can, but not now. A bit, it seems good anyway, and right now it's perfectly visible the exit of our artillery, where it's operating from. Exactly, it can be seen from where they are shooting. Some arrival. Pieces of the shot-down enemy drone. Most likely, there was some chamber, foam wings, most likely scattered. And by the way, the mine barrier is installed, as it's installed in details we won't explain, so let it remain a secret for the occupiers, but the mine barriers are there. And even if you don't see them, well, that means they are camouflaged, for example, like here stands an anti-tank mine. That is already active. Forward. We've installed the mines, now we continue installing non-explosive engineering barriers, inconspicuous obstacles on the Russian MZP that's what it's called. What is this? - This is a tangle that will rust in a week and visually will be very hard to notice, equipment winds it onto the leading parts and it gets stuck. The sun is slowly rising and working alongside that, it becomes increasingly dangerous because the number of so-called light aviation, reconnaissance drones, strike FPV and the group that is moving now. It is already becoming a target, that is in just a couple of minutes 20 minutes and it will be necessary to finish up; this is a matter of security and the preservation of personnel. An anti-tank minefield has been installed, non-explosive engineering barriers of the tangle type have been set up. And we also need to set up an anti-personnel device. This is already at the very end when we were about to leave the position. And that's it, for today we are finishing our stay here. - But the war doesn't end, there's work every day? - Of course. How could it be otherwise? I love explosive works, the work of destruction, but i love finding and clearing all this junk even more... that the occupiers (orcs) leave for us, then take it to the range and make a big boom. And i particularly love detonating FABs, that's a real beauty right there.
