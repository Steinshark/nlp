[howling] One wolf pack. [snarling] One leader. [snarling] One place. And one focus... [snarling and growling] Survive. This is Yellowstone Living here is not easy. And winter strikes the hardest. A season of punishing extremes, where everyone must fight Yellowstone's winter The wolves of Greater This is the Dark Wolf's Her mate was killed. Now she's in charge. The pack is young. Dark Wolf must teach them Or they won't live Their first lesson-- how to take down an elk The wolves' only chance But the pack doesn't keep up. One good kick could Hunting big game alone She must teach the pack or they won't last. In winter everyone needs For some, preparation October. In just a few weeks, this The devoted parents who Lives depend on it. Inside the beaver's lodge [whining] Each one eats its weight [whining] So mom and dad must stockpile or their children will starve. No time to lose. [creaking] It takes nearly 100 trees to That's a ton of wood. The icy water keeps their Today, Dad's in charge To keep out the draft No self-respecting beaver dad Mud, moss and sticks A well-made lodge can be 100 [kit crying] And it's ready just in time. Yellowstone's winter As temperatures plummet, It triggers Yellowstone's the bighorn sheep rut. [bang] Every big, considers himself a contender. The arena--a coliseum Their feet are built But sheep do fall. The last ram standing This big, old ram But his trials have just begun. Each ewe is only receptive [snorts] He smells carefully But the ewe's powerful scent transfixes them. Call it obsession. [snorting] [snorts] As the testosterone peaks, The champ must constantly show Intimidation is key. Smaller rams know [bleating] Low blows are fair game. But the old champ's trials This huge, young brawler wants And he won't leave The main event. Challenger versus champion. Winner takes all. The reigning ram and size each other up. The ewes await their champion. [snorts] [snorts] [snorts] [bang] Their massive horns are used They weigh up to 30 pounds, as much as all the bones A massive tendon keeps their Two layers of skull bone The force of this impact [snorts] It's too much for the old ram. He has no fight left. There's a new champion At two miles high, these mountains shape They surround the park. They sit at the end forged by Yellowstone's This corridor is also funneling moist Pacific air When this moisture collides it turns to massive But there are some who use snow The red fox is built for winter. At only ten pounds, he doesn't So he can search far and wide But how do you find His solution--big ears. The catch? His victims are under But he can pinpoint [faint rustling] The fox locks onto a target. [faint rustling] A meadow vole. But what now? [rustling] If he digs, the vole will flee. Instead, he flies. Neither one will give up. [snarling] Just a small bite. But in winter, The Dark Wolf has her pack 30 miles and counting. And still no big meals. The younger wolves still Most days are spent A wolf's nose is a hundred times The faintest scent tells them The Dark Wolf picks up Droplets of blood This could feed her pack Since wolves returned elk have learned to avoid them. [howling] The herd splits up They hide under the cover The wolves know he's here. Somewhere. You can't hide blood The hunt is on. The wolves must work together. Even a wounded elk They take turns looking for weakness. The elk makes a clever move. The stream buys him some time. The inexperienced youngsters But the pack has lost [whimpering] And they know it. Another failed hunt. [howling] Another hungry night ahead. By now most of Greater are hibernating But this huge male is still Fresh bison meat. But even the mighty grizzly as winter closes in. Surviving winter's wrath means Open water is a great place This bobcat is hunting A crafty ambush predator. Silent... Patient... And always on the prowl. Her latest kill is She must defend it against The coyote. [caws] [growling] A feather is all he can get. Score one for the cats. [cawing] The coyote needs One that he can steal from, While some suffer river otters are [squeaking] [snarling] But the fun is coming to an end for this mother and Their home on the Yellowstone But it's not frozen yet, so they'll feed here [squeaks] The pup is still It's easier just to steal Mom's. But he must learn to Soon she'll send him on his way. And there are many dangers A starving coyote will eagerly The coyote is ready to attack. The otter's only chance The coyote is patient, looking [snarls] He can swim, but not like an otter. Mom and her pup are safe, But Yellowstone won't Soon almost everything Without open water, Yellowstone even tests Bison have lived here since They've survived 10,000 But it's this calf's first. Winter forces them The calf must keep up. The bison are not heading but warmer ones. Yellowstone's geyser basins Thanks to the chamber of molten Beyond the thermals, Ponds are first to set, locking the beaver lodge in ice. Then slower flowing Then the faster ones. Winter even tames the Rockies' Lower Yellowstone Falls. The otters are now There's only one hole And it's freezing up, too. They need to leave But Mom is cautious. With a coyote on the prowl, she'd rather hold tight But the pup's natural instinct This could be a fatal mistake. [squeaks] The young otter is caught out. [squeaks] His eyes are designed Out here, he can barely see. [squeaking] He's lost... [squeaks] ...and alone. [squeaks] [grumbling] Halfway through their trek, the bison mother is [grumbling] ...and struggling. Her calf can only keep up [grumbling] At its worst, can kill hundreds of bison. At last, a sign of hope. Warm water is keeping this river The geyser basin must be ahead. So close... But Yellowstone is not done yet. Enter the lone wolf. Hungry... and desperate. One solitary wolf against a thousand-pound [grumbling] The wolf will try then go for the calf. [bellowing] [growling] [bellows] But it won't work. Mom has seen it all before. [bird squawking] The mother otter has [sniffing] He's lost, further down [squeaking] Too far for Mom [squeaking] But the coyote hears him. [squeaking] Only the deep snow Mom finally picks up The pup's survival depends [squeaking] At last, Mom hears her son. [squeaking] And he hears her. No time for greetings. The coyote is closing in. They need to get to And they know just how to do it. Escape at last! In midwinter, the night sky But clear skies can descend Temperatures can drop [owl hooting] Stealing energy from all and finishing off the weak, the savage cold is These winterkills help [squawking] Finally, the hungry coyote [squawking] A bison carcass. He can't let his guard down. Wolves have been feeding here. Fresh meat is hard to leave. But you don't mess with wolves. If they find him, With wolves on the prowl, the coyote better make Easy come... ...easy go. [eagle chirps] The bison herd's long journey They're close to And now, for the first time, The warmth draws them in. The calf and his mother Day and night, scalding water erupts from It can kill any animal But for the herd At last, they can eat. The grass is last season's, This meal comes with a price. The geyser water deposits all over the grass. Bison can live for 20 years, but this sandy grass may grind and then they'll For the bison, these hot springs Their presence is felt All this hot water creates one of the most unique Every second, over 500 gallons pours into Yellowstone's warming it by up to 18 degrees. So this river never freezes. It's a natural, warm sanctuary The desperate otters are [water running] But finally, [squeaking] The pup's hungry enough [swans honking] He's faced Yellowstone's dangers He's ready to set out But maybe not just yet. Under the ice, the beaver family through four months of winter. There's still plenty of food Which is good, 'cause Mom and Dad have Making it seven kids in all. They've worked hard But their victory is part that starts with the wolves. Wolves hunt elk, which means elk may eat fewer [wolves snarling] Successful beaver ponds Otters love trout. Fewer elk also means less whose population Wolves spark an ecological that benefits many But for it all to work, the wolves must do their job... kill. The Dark Wolf and her pack But they have a target. A yearling. The Dark Wolf drives the elk where she'll have the advantage. The others now know what to do. They choose their target well. The yearling is tiring. [snarling] [elk squeals] At last, the pack has learned With this kill they've turned into their ally. And with their success,
