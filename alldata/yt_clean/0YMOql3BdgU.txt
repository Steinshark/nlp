III Separate Assault Brigade presents Get up, bro. Get up. It's 7 in the morning. Right away like this, right? Good morning. After two air raid alarms now up for some morning exercise. To cheer everyone up a little. Raise motivation. - For sure. Is it raining outside? - It wasn't when I was outside. Coach, are you putting makeup on in there or what? Nah. Who's getting the weapons? There's a whole line there, isn't it? - Yes. There is already. &quot;Tisha&quot;. Good morning. *Roll call going on* My callsign is &quot;Tisha&quot;. I was a student. Used to study, but then this stuff happened. Let's cut this out. I studied management at the veterinary institute. Economics. Girls usually come here to become combat medics. But. I don't know. I like it better. Well, can't really say I like. But I would like to start with the infantry. By twos, number! - First! Second! Left sector. The &quot;firsts&quot; gather here. The &quot;seconds&quot; hold the right sector. Everyone mans their sector in accordance with their number. Why are you all standing in one side? Is everyone holding the right side? How will you hold the left one then? Faster! Faster! Three meters from each other! Glory to the Nation! Death to the enemies! Path of the Warrior Part Two First, we will talk a little with the fighters of the Third Assault Brigade. Then there will be a concert. There will also be an auction. And, if you have such an opportunity, you will be able to make a donation for the needs of the Third Assault Brigade. Right off, the question: in what case does the Third Assault Brigade not accept a person who wants to join the brigade? That is, a person comes up and says: &quot;I want to.&quot; But for some reason you may not take them. What are those reasons? Well, it can be physical fitness, for example. A person may not pass the physical test. But we still give the opportunity to move in for a trial period, which means that a person will live together with recruits for a week, train, get in shape. Then pass the necessary tests. If a person is adequate, motivated... We give everyone a chance to join the Third Assault Brigade. There is always an individual selection of equipment. Always. Accordingly, if today, let's say, my task is to storm a trench, then I will have one loadout and one set in my first aid kit. Then tomorrow I may have the task of storming a building, which is a completely different task. And I will have a different loadout. Magnetic compasses. Military grade. This is the standard issue compass for all fighters in the United States of America. And this is a Chinese no-name. In short, same as with tourniquets, right? Everyone at the start, ready? fine. Countdown to five and we start five people at a time. 1! 2! 3! 4! 5! The first question here is: how much time passes from when you came to join the brigade to the moment you become warriors on the combat duty? &quot;Mrak&quot;. Personally for you. How long did it take from the moment you came along? Currently I'm in the recruiting center. It has been the third month now. I will go to the brigade at the end of the month. So, these three months are constant studying and training, right? Yes. Yes. Constant. This is the answer to the question that people have, like, &quot;Will they send us into battle right away?&quot; Are you in the recruiting center or on training? - No, in the recruiting center. How long have you been there? - One month. - A month. And you, &quot;Czech&quot;? - One month too. And you may not have to be there for three months, correct? It's individual. - Yes. You pull it through here again. This time for fixing the sling itself. And at this moment you secure the safety strap. When will they finally stick some magazines to you? Okay. You realize that we are being filmed and we're acting as usual? That's the point. - It is. Let's do it this way so that they know there are only tough fellows here. Hey, what's up? Those are my chocolates! My chocolates! I put them off for the winter, damn it! Let's divide it in half. - I don't want it now. I was putting the chocolates off for the winter and now you're eating me off! Can I get a photo with &quot;Mrak&quot;? - With whom? Is it a video recording? - It is. What do you think it is? What was that fooling around about when I stepped in here? And now everything's quiet. Out of jokes already. We're getting rid of jokes. - You were jumping on the bed. What happened? I wasn't jumping on the bed actually. Photo? - Yes. - Take a photo of the three of us together. Glory to the Nation! Death to the enemies! Why were you jumping on the bunks? - I wasn't jumping. It wasn't me. Was it you? What happened? We were happy to see you. Nah, you didn't see me as you were jumping. Now you'll be doing push-ups for your lies. - Someone took his chocolates. I just got back. From work. You were shouting here. You were that happy? I wasn't shouting. I have no energy. Come on. Down for push-ups. You're deceiving me for the second time. Down for push-ups! Come on. Position one! Hold position one. What's up? - Deceived me twice. I didn't deceive you. - About what? Position two! - About what? I asked what was going on here. He was like, &quot;Nothing. It's fine.&quot; I stepped in and some fuss was on. They had fun for some reason. I asked: &quot;Why were you laughing? I could hear you from the outside.&quot; - I've remembered. They took my chocolate. Ah, you've remembered. Come on. One! Memory's getting better. - Right. Join Third Assault Brigade! Position one! He just came from work. Had some fun. He didn't see what was happening here all day. Where? In our... What's up? - It's alright. Today was very fun. - Come on. One! Stay like this until I come back. Okay? Position one! Two! Stand up! Did you understand what it was for? Yes. - For what? - Because I didn't remember what was happening. Lining up on the third floor! - Yes, right! Forwards! 71! 72! 74! 75! I think I've been here for 88 or 78 days. Among the brothers. A lot has changed since then, let's say. It became more clear what preparation is and how it happens. More seriously. I sometimes skipped lessons because of some problems. But with each lesson, everything became more and more interesting. Hands up and down! Up and down! Walking around as if enchanted. So, alright, first of all, we discharge the weapons. Raise the barrels up. Take safety off. Move the bolt carrier with the bolt to the lowest position and hold it. Make sure there is no round in the chamber. Made sure? - Yes, right! Let it go without following it. Then - control trigger pull. On safe. First position is a position for shooting and moving with a weapon while standing. Place your feet a little wider than the width of your shoulders. If it's a right-handed stance, your right leg is the supporting leg. Set back half a foot. With that, your feet, like the rest of your body, are facing frontally. Parts of the body - neck, head. Right here, all the areas here, from the middle of the back to the feet, you keep them relaxed. And all these body movements will affect if you will be shooting for a long time. A battle can last two hours, four, six, eight. In my practice - we were clashing for 12 fucking hours. Your task is to study, train, prepare. And so on repeat. Constantly. Line up the formation! Forward, march! For me, the attitude towards people has definitely changed completely. It helped me understand who is really around me. To be honest, I used to not like people very much. They usually bothered me. Or I bothered them. And now that I have been here for a long time with the same guys, or with new ones, I understand how important it is to work together. It is really nice and important when there is a spirit of unity. We clean up here. - We've just finished the cleanup. We had a meal and we cleaned everything. - Okay. Why everything is neat here, and over there some total shit is going on? Because this is a third squad. It's the best one. When there, I advise you to keep the rifle in the combat position and as close to you as possible. Not so that the barrel is perpendicular to your body, but parallel. Those waiting over there, double time, march! You'll have time for smiles later. Focus on the obstacle course! Press the rifle to you! I remind you once again! Because it will end up in your teeth! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! More active! &quot;Shofer&quot;, you are responsible for keeping everyone moving! Pick up the pace! Those who've completed 4+ minutes, walk. Down for push-ups! I came for an interview. They told me: &quot;Wait a week. We will tell you then. Maybe we have vacancies in the rear.&quot; I said: &quot;You have a test week. Let me pass it.&quot; So. We went to take a physical test. Then they told me: &quot;You passed the physical test. You can join.&quot; I really like the brotherhood vibe here. They don't treat me like a girl. Now a month has passed and I see that we are all like &quot;bro, brother&quot; here. Like that. Joking with each other. Already found common topics. It's quite good. Was it difficult at the beginning? Well, I can't say it was easy. After this - KMB. And then? - And then on combat duty. Right away? - Probably. Well, so it was with others. You want a photo? - Yes. So why don't you say it? Come on, men. 1! 2! 3! 4! 5! Start! I! Love! Third! Assault Brigade! I! Love! Third! Assault Brigade! Alright, girls. Who wants a photo, come up! - Yeah, yeah, yeah, now you'll have a whole line of them! Lads, who missed the knee pad? I did! - You did, right? One more thing that I can add is that I miss the boys who have already left for the duty. &quot;Mrak&quot;, for example. I would gladly go with them. But I don't regret that I stayed here. Studied even more. It is an opportunity that is actually very valuable. To study medicine and military tactics. So. GPS is a completely safe connection, because if your device works only to receive the GPS signal, that is, it does not transmit it, then it is completely safe. If it is, for instance, a GPS tracker, or a watch such as Garmin and the like. Or you turned on geo data on some device in order to use, let's say, the &quot;Kropiva&quot;. And you get a GPS connection. It is completely safe. One hundred percent if you have some kind of synchronization with anything, like Google Drive, whatever. With iCloud. In one or another format, in one or another form, this file will be &quot;hanging&quot; somewhere, pretty much outside your phone. That's why you shouldn't photograph or videotape shit, if you're not sure that it won't end up where you don't need it to. Oh, hey! - The instructor's here. Started to rain, hasn't it? - Yes. Where will we have the lesson? - In the gym perhaps. - Not &quot;perhaps&quot; but &quot;most likely&quot;. We'll see. As God decides. My callsign is &quot;Easy&quot;. In civilian life I was a welder. But before the full-scale invasion, I was also practicing disaster medicine. Medicine is almost the first thing that will be needed. Because life itself will depend on it. Where's &quot;Kub&quot;? Where's &quot;Kub&quot;? - Went down just now. The two main types of tourniquets that are now used at the frontline and in general, the most popular ones, are the American &quot;CAT&quot; generation six and seven, and our &quot;Sich&quot;. Even &quot;CAT&quot; or &quot;Sich&quot; don't guarantee that the tourniquet can completely cut off and stop the bleeding and save you. And I had my birthday on October 16. My son turned 20 on October 6. In the trenches. He said: &quot;We'll celebrate it then, after our victory&quot;. I was gifted 550 pushups for my birthday. - That is nice. I mean, I did them since I was gifted them. 10x. That's all. That was 54, 55. - It looked terrible. I was shaking like I don't know what. Like a washing machine. Well, I used to take different trainings before. I thought that I was preparing for something bigger. And that's what happened. So. There was also such a moment. I was on the set of &quot;Dvizh&quot; of the Third Assault Brigade in Lviv, and there they were hanging out the &quot;Test Week&quot; leaflets. So, I made my decision. That text pretty much described my inner feelings then. I decided to submit the application and came here. Should I take water with me for the line-up? - No, don't. Take it, take it. We'll see how it turns out. And where are their report papers? They did everything and left the reports for you. What do you mean &quot;did everything&quot;? The sergeants also signed? Well, I don't know. They said in the chat that they left the reports on the table. Shit. Open that message. Show it. You've seen me already but I haven't yet! I had one client. Dude hadn't cut his hair in about 10 years. He said: &quot;Damn, cut it. I'll close my eyes.&quot; I cut his hair. And he also had such a big beard. Did you trim his beard too? - Yes. So, I cut his hair. He opened his eyes. And, damn, he started to cry. I was like: &quot;Why are you crying?&quot; And he said: &quot;Mark, this isn't me&quot;. I said: &quot;Don't cry again, please&quot;. He said &quot;Thank you&quot;. Like. Also, he didn't smell very good. The dude had been saving up for a barbershop for 10 years. - Didn't wash himself, nothing. I also accidentally cut the girl's hair bald. Today? - No. And what did she tell you? She was hurt. They'll cut your hair like that too. If they catch me. Zakerzonia. And the next stage was supposed to be the deportation of Western Ukrainians from western Ukraine, because it was clear that it was impossible to defeat the Ukrainian Insurgent Army as long as there were people who massively supported it. And the film &quot;Executed Dawns&quot; is dedicated to these very events of 1947. The insurgents, the commissars, everyone is in it. Clearly, the storyline itself is fictional, but the circumstances themselves are completely as they were. Ukrainian Insurgent Army prevented the mass deportation of Ukrainians from western Ukraine to other regions of Ukraine or to Siberia, beyond the Urals, and so on. So, hope you enjoy the film. Well, everyone was going so I went too. In fact, I did not feel life to the fullest. Now I understand what I'm doing. What I'm doing, why I'm doing do, how I'm doing it. I have a purpose in life. May I not know fear! Not know what hesitation is! Strengthen my spirit! Temper my will! Dwell in my heart! Grow me to fair deeds! In those deeds may I find death! Sweet death in torments for You! And I will dissolve in You! And I will live forever in You! Eternal Ukraine! Holy! Mighty! United! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the Heroes! Glory to the Nation! Death to the enemies! Ukraine! Above everything! Ukraine! Above everything! Ukraine! Above everything! By the Prayer! Holy fucking shit. The war has begun. - Huh? - The war has begun. - It has. - Stand up. For battle! Now we're all gathering up and going to fucking fight. He who doesn't have magazines is a loser, damn it. Bitch, I'll shoot my dugout neighbor in the leg for moving around near me at night. It's damn obvious he's a medic. What else would he fucking roll his sleeping mat with? What did you think? Come fucking hold this! Damn, that's fucking awesome, bro! Don't take off your glasses. That's all. And evacuate the commander. You can't leave him here. To the &quot;gazebo&quot; and there join up with &quot;Ded's&quot; group and take &quot;Matiz&quot; by storm. It was sabotage. Grenades are sabotage. You saw the guys with the box of grenades? Kind of to have more fun? Groups, keep your distance! Take firing positions with your people. Our group will try to go around from the rear now. Grenade! Who? Greens! Who are you? - Greens! The hell are you shooting at us? Shit! Damn it! Don't fucking shoot at the cameraman! I'm not shooting. I'm killed. I'm not shooting. I'm done. I'm done. Minus! Who needs a machine gun? Who needs a machine gun? The dead keep silent. Get the fuck out! You saw that? Biletsky is on the first floor. I'm not even coming out! It's Andriy Yevheniyovych, actually. He winked at me as if I were leaving for Bakhmut tomorrow. Checked the tourniquets, bandaged his leg. Counted the pulse. Wrapped him in a blanket so that he would not have hypothermia. And that's basically it. Counted the pulse, counted breathing. Made sure everything was ok with him. He was stable. In a state of consciousness. I had a conversation with him all the time to understand whether his state of consciousness was not deteriorating. In short, everything was great. Wrote down all the data. That I gave him pills, and what procedures I performed on him, and handed him over for evacuation. That's all. Coped in 13 minutes. Basically, I was praised. Cool. Okay, fine. Yes, that's it. Say hi to everyone too. Okay, bye. Love you. I want to move on as soon as possible. Finally get into the brigade. So that they give us a new level of military progress, military science. It will be even more interesting there. Long story short, the further the more interesting. Should I leave the beard? Beard? Yes. - What for? Leave the beard. I'll be walking around looking like a Sarmatian. Bald, but with a beard. End of Part Two
