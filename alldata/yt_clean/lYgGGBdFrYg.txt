Plus. What do they give in terms of information? Head B. That's all for now. How is the second one? The second one is slightly [wounded]. Is he breathing normally by himself? Yes. Just his head. &quot;Bare&quot;. Yes? Look. I'm going to bring him in. If you're not busy, make sure he doesn't hit his head, okay? Plus. Okay. I will sit down here immediately. Okay. There was a call about two wounded. And the first thing I heard on the radio was that it was a head injury. I see a lot of blood on the bandage on the back of the head. A lot of it. It is a TBI [traumatic brain injury]. It can be severe, it can be moderate or mild. You never know... Plus, received. &quot;The box&quot; [evac] is almost at the start, at the start. I'm waiting for the call. &quot;Matviy&quot;, get on the line. &quot;Matviy&quot; here. &quot;Matviy&quot;, start to move... . Do you copy? Plus-plus. ... meters from the front. A CASEVAC, an armored car. An ordinary car will go in, but there is no guarantee that it will come out. The distance is how many &quot;short&quot;[minutes]? One. One short. One short. Get ready at the door. Where are you? Keep moving, we can hear you. Keep going. &quot;Bare&quot;, are you ready? Yes. We are closing in, 20 meters. I see you, I see you. The doors! Take, take! Door! Go! Move, move! Get him! I got him! Help! Come on, let's go! Legs, legs! Close the door! Close it now! Shut the f****ng door! Move! Come on, buddy. Are you all right? Call sign? Brother, it's okay. We're going home. I got him. Plus. I got it. Put your head there. We must leave before the &quot;white&quot; [dawn]. Hold on! I got you, brother. It's okay. It's okay. From the other side! The other side! Keep going, keep going! Get your feet up! Lift them up! Hang on, brother. We need to get out of here. On yourself, that way. On the count of three. One, on &quot;Bare&quot;, that way. Two, three. Talk to us. Buddy, are you with us? Squeeze my hand. Squeeze my hand if you can hear me. It's okay. It's going to be a bumpy ride. It's going to be bumpy. It's going to be a little bumpy, but we have to go fast. He's from Azov. He's ours! Azov is with you, brother, everything is okay! No strangers here. Hold on for 10 minutes. We'll transfer you now. It will be better from here. Talk to me, I can't hear you very well. I love you! What? He says he loves us. Azov loves you too! Here, here. That's it, the finish line. 400 meters. I can already see the evacuation team. Don't stop squeezing my hand. Don't stop squeezing it. The injury was serious. Very serious one. Shrapnel head wound. But, thank God, everything went well. He was in a lot of pain, from what I heard from behind. It was harder to go back. It was already dark, but you cannot turn on the headlights. The NVD [night vision device] was too far away and there was no time to put it on. So I decided to drive by feel. That's it, take him out. Feet, feet. Okay, &quot;Bare&quot;, you ready? Yeah. Come on, be careful. Keep his head up. I'm stuck, I can't get out. Just a little bit more, brother, just a little bit more. We pull you to the stretcher. It's going to be okay. Closer, closer. It's okay, it's okay. Look at it. Buddy, can you hear me? Calm down, we're not going to hurt you. Take it easy. I am just going to take off this bandage. That's it, no pressure. Please look into the light. Your pupils seem straight. When you see a fighter, you see his injuries, you see his condition, your only thought is to do everything precisely, to do everything as well as possible. This is the moment of maximum concentration that I always like. And the best feeling is that I brought the fighter to the stabilization point, he is alive, he is stable. I did everything I could on my part. And thanks to that, the man will continue to receive treatment, but most importantly, he will survive. The wounded fighter was in constant contact with us. He even asked us to take a picture of him. We did it successfully, already in the medevac. And then, according to the data from the stabilization point, we got the following picture: everything is quite good. You're doing great. You're doing really well. His condition has not worsened. Everything was done to him as it should have been. As gently as possible. In this case it was an open head injury. It is such a delicate mechanism, the head, that you never know what can happen there. That's why we have to take in the wounded fighter as soon as possible and do everything to prevent him from getting worse. Thank God he is alive, and conscious. I am very happy.
