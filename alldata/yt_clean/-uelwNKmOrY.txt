Hello, forest friends! I started my day feeling fresh with the morning rain. The sound of insects is really nice to hear! Haneul is super tense! He's trying to act cool but is wary of the robot vacuum cleaner! I have something important to do, so it's a busy morning! Today is the day to organize the pantry and bedding closet, tasks I've been putting off! I've been to IKEA diligently these past few days! Raise your hand if you saw it on my Instagram! Let's calm down the startled Haneul, and get started with today's tasks! I'm officially on duty in the kitchen! These days, I'm watering my plants every 2-3 days! It's still quite hot, so the plants are drinking a lot of water! With so many plants, an hour or two flies by quickly! While watering, I also greet the new leaves I find... And check on the Choco Leaf plant, which still hasn't developed any red leaves! I thought the scent was coming from the Rose Herb... But it turns out, the Orange Jasmine bloomed! Even the plants that hadn't sprouted new leaves are showing them now, all at once! So, spending an hour or two watering plants feels more like joy than hard work to me! After my time with the plants, I finally start today's mission. Today's main mission is organizing the pantry and bedding closet! Since they're right next to the kitchen and a space where the kids freely come and go, it really needs tidying up! First, we begin by clearing everything out! From newly released IKEA items to popular ones, I've applied them all to my home! Where did all this stuff go? Please stay tuned until the end to find out! ^^ When cleaning, I use old cloths! I hardly ever use wet wipes! Here's the IKEA Risatorp basket! It has a partitioned handle different from the usual ones! With separable sections, it's great for both storing and finding items! I think Haneul noticed I was busy yuyu The wooden partition is sturdy, and the handle is firm, making it one of my best purchases! It seems perfect for storing both small and tall items! The flexible shape makes it excellent for storing items of various sizes! It works well for most long items! Since it's made of metal, even cans and spam fit safely and securely! Spam is organized perfectly, too. ^^ I use recycled paper bags to create compartments for storage! I set up snacks and coffee that my family can grab whenever they want. The deep baskets are great for storing small desserts! Homes with kids tend to have a lot of pouches, right? The low Risatorp basket is great for folding and storing fabric items! I always buy the Linning dishcloths from IKEA! As soon as I get home, I wash them and organize them! They help keep various kitchen cloths neatly organized! I store bulky and rarely used items! Since they're heavy, I'll put them on the bottom shelf of the pantry! These are things I bought around the time my kids were born. Like baking tools I bought with too much enthusiasm, and large glass jars... It's hard to make things in bulk when you have kids! Some are shared, and some are labeled for storage! I put the steamer and large pots that are mainly used when guests come into this box! The smaller size of the *Sockerbit* boxes stacks neatly on top of the larger size. It's great for space utilization! I put items that are only used for special occasions in the smaller boxes. These are things I need when I travel or do crafting! This is a storage box for family medicine! Two products are stacked together!! I mark the expiration date on the top of the medicine package! A little effort makes it easier to manage! I recycled the cardboard box from the delivery for storage! While organizing, I found many expired medicines. Regular organization is essential! I gather expired medicines and take them to the disposal bins at health centers or community centers! Don't forget to label things, so your family can use them efficiently too. I also write the expiration date on ointments with a marker! Stack them neatly from the bottom shelf up! I also make the most of the baskets I already have! Make sure to write down the exact size of the space you need for storage! That way, you can fully utilize the storage cabinet and organize things efficiently based on how often you use them. You can also avoid unnecessary spending from sizing mistakes! I visited IKEA several times to configure this small space! I felt proud seeing the space arranged so economically! This is why pre-planning is essential. I store things I use relatively often and shelf-stable powders here! It seemed like organizing was quick, but it took time to arrange everything based on how they'll be used. The first phase of pantry organization is mostly done. I went to IKEA again to complete the space. I'll show you the additional video shortly ^^ This is the storage box I used for supplements in the pantry! It's better to keep it on the kitchen island, where I reach for it often! This is a trivet for placing hot pots next to the induction cooktop. It's made of stainless steel with rubber feet, so it protects the kitchen counter from heat damage! It fits perfectly, like it was measured for the spot! A small but reliable... alarm clock, true to its purpose! I mainly use the phone holder while doing the dishes and watching videos. As it's made of metal, it's heavy and sturdy. I'm watching Macaron Lady's cooking video! I'm also using IKEA dishwashing gloves! I like that I can choose the size since my hands are small. Plus, the colors are really pretty! These are cute items no matter where you put them! ^^ I'm playing with my favorite toy, a stuffed crayfish! Isn't it adorable? I got a sturdy stainless steel utensil holder because the kitchen tool rack kept falling if I knocked it. I love the base and interior design. But I made a critical mistake! Since I'm hanging it on the upper cabinet, it would be inconvenient to grab long utensils. So, I gave up and decided to use it for gardening tools instead of kitchen utensils! Wow~ It fits perfectly in the plant trolley! The spacing is just right! That moment of joy when an unexpected idea works out! You could use this idea not just in the kitchen but all over your home! These are magnetic clips from the same series! They're versatile and multi-purpose. This is a hanging basket I bought for maximizing space in the pantry! You can't just leave small spaces unused!! I bought an artificial plant (*Fejka*) to liven up this dark space. Try hanging it using the hanging basket! Just two artificial plants can change the atmosphere! I also bought S-hooks and hooks to hang kitchen utensils again. Giving the kitchen hook system another try! I secured the inside with a screwdriver and the outside with a drill! Finally, peace of mind! I couldn't give up on the storage container, so I decided to put in Scindapsus instead. ^^ Since there's no 304 stainless steel label, I added a glass container inside! Now the kitchen has a touch of freshness! This is the *Variera* pot lid organizer that many people use! It's great for organizing plates or pots! Super sturdy! I use it for small pots and pans, and as a plate organizer in the upper cabinet! Now it's time to organize the bedding closet! The reason I chose this product is The ones where you insert paper panels tend to collapse after long use~ So, I chose one with metal supports and handles, and I made sure the material wasn't too thin. I bought two sizes: one large size and one half-size to fit both horizontally and vertically. I also sorted the bedding, rugs, and pillows according to the season and use. It's satisfying because I can easily take things out and organize them when needed! Starting the organizing process feels daunting, but once you finish, it's so rewarding! These are storage bins with handles! They're too big for holding the kids' school supplies but perfect for organizing socks or underwear. If I go to IKEA again, I plan to buy more of these *Fongroda* storage baskets. They're so useful for storing small things. They were also incredibly useful when organizing my dressing room. You can even organize your socks by color in a pretty way. It's a must-have for housewives with wrist issues! A bottle opener. You can open bottles without much effort. I couldn't find it every time I went, but this time, I succeeded! It's a very famous basin! I wasn't planning to buy it, but I wanted the new green color. It has a rounded rectangular shape, and the subtle green color is beautiful, but it was sold out uu It's a foldable one that doesn't take up much space, and it's lightweight and perfect for laundry! I hope you succeed in getting the green color! While looking for a turntable for storing sauces in the fridge, I found this product, which is the perfect size and made of sturdy material. It's made of zinc-coated steel, so it's good to use in humid areas, and I love its solid feel. It turns smoothly and stably. After moving the containers to a space with better height, the fridge looks much more organized. Whenever I open the fridge, I can't resist the hungry eyes of *Haneul*, my food-loving king. It's snack time! SKY has great focus ^^ Before the kids come home from school, the robot vacuum cleans the neglected spots! Does anyone else feel like they've finished the job only after doing a final cleaning? Or is it just me? Once the house is organized and the cleaning is done, my mood lifts! Every evening, I make one side dish for dinner~ Today, it's Spanish omelette. The base ingredients for this dish are potatoes and eggs! Parmesan cheese and olive oil add flavor, and you just need some vegetables you like! I'm watching *Milla Nonna's* video again! She's one of my favorite YouTubers! I'm so happy to see her again yuyu I'm removing the starch from the potatoes! I'm chopping carrots and onions too~ And chopping some bacon! I'm using five eggs. Salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup of milk. Fry the potatoes in olive oil until golden! Since I'll bake them in the oven, they don't need to be fully cooked! Lay the potatoes in the oven dish and let them cool slightly! Saute the vegetables and bacon with salt, pepper, and olive oil. Pour the egg mixture evenly. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese and parsley, then into the oven~ It'll be a hearty side dish for a meal! How did you enjoy today's video? I hope the IKEA-organized spaces were helpful. Thank you for watching until the end. For more stories, visit me on Instagram @illysoop_
