Do kids or old people have better food? Let's talk about that. Good Mythical Morning. Everyone assumes that we Well, one of us. But like anyone, our tastes have become a But as middle aged gentlemen, we're not quite at the point home meatloaf over Lunchables. Nursing home meatloaf Yes, it is Sundays. I love a good meatloaf. So, being the perfect middle aged we're gonna find out whether or if we still have some deliciousness It's time for Children's The Great Generational Food Fight. Okay, all you have to do today is taste your favorite at the end, we'll see if you prefer old And we've got some very special guests Oh, do we? Is it time for my bath? Meemaw, no, no, no. Go get the food. This is food time, not bath time. Sorry about that. Hey, buddy. Hi, I'm Eddie, and I'm a little boy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My Meemaw says I'm not No, you're not. But you look, like, nice fellas. We're very nice men. So, Tony the Tiger told me to You'll enjoy them. They're great. This is Raisin Bran. Okay. That's a big little boy. And a very realistic grandma. Milk me. That's kind of my thing, yeah. Frosted Flakes. I mean, I definitely downed a lot of these as a kid. I don't eat them much now. Yeah, doesn't it? Yeah. And you know what? I'm not gonna wait to do this, because they get soggy, These get soggy, too. Yeah. They're both kind of sog monsters. But I love. I missed the, missed the bowl entirely. I love the nostalgia of a good Frosted Flake. It's a great taste. Or should I say? Grr-eat. Yeah. So sweet. But, like, not too sweet. Like, but it's not too sweet. Like, I know that it's too sweet, but my mind knows that it's too sweet, Yeah. Over here, look at that. I mean, I'm not trying to give but look at the amount of raisins, Well, not in that bowl. It is a lot of raisins, though. Now, but you're a raisin. You do a different kind. I'm a Raisin Nut Bran guy. But all of the Bran, this one was named after the is. Gives you the fiber. You know, the older you get. The more you need. You need more fiber. But we discovered fiber in college, and we've never looked back. We discovered fiber. That's one of the things we're known for. We love some fiber. They didn't know about it In college, we started eating prunes out of a container. We just keep it on top of, the dorm fridge. We were very much old people eaters in college. Taste wise, I feel like Frosted Flakes But I feel like this is helping move everything through. And this, and I don't feel like What is the? Do we have sugar content? Let's see. Frosted Flakes, they're obviously frosted with sugar. It says it's twelve grams But Raisin Bran, I think we knew we talked about Raisin Bran, More sugar? What about fiber? It's probably because of the raisins. The raisins are very sugar. There's a lot of sugar. Yeah. I don't think you have Frosted Flakes, and then move the decimal boys, I don't know how this works, like, they talk about net carbs. So if you take the net carbs, if you take the fiber and you get to ten grams of sugar. Says it right here. I don't know how that works. So, technically, it's less. It's a less. I don't know how it did it. Did you know that fiber Yeah, yeah, we discovered it. Of course we know that. It's high in overall wellness. More sugar. I want more sugar as an old person. And you can feel less guilty because fiber and something about net carbs but I should, There's something about I think these tastes better. But these make me feel And I don't think they taste horrible. I think they taste decent. If you don't eat Frosted Oh, my gosh. Look at that. That is exactly what I'm gonna look like. That's scary. I'm going with oldies as well. Yep. We're both going with Oldie. Go ahead. Such a good boy. That's liverwurst sandwich. Oh, gosh. This is disgusting. Got the word worst in it. Yeah, it is the worst. Whereas this is the best. This is mystery meat, aka bologna. So, little boy's favorite treat. How is your voice so deep? I have a issue with my pituitary gland. That I thank you not to comment on. Oh, okay. When did you get married? Can we? Let's go. I don't think you're a little boy. No, I am. Pituitary. I don't. You don't like either one of these. I don't feel happiness with this round. Because bologna is something that. I did a lot of bologna growing up. Now, cheese and mustard. I never did bologna and mayonnaise, but. It's so manufactured. But it is, like, millennial pink. That's kind of what I love about it. Not the pink, but I like kind of the lab grown nature of it. Put it next to my skin. Is that your. I've been going for a bologna complexion. Bologna complexion? I've been working on it. It doesn't taste horrible. Liverwurst. I've never had it. And thank you for adding mayonnaise, No problem. Do you go by granny? Grandma? Nana? Nanny? Meemaw? Mimy? Mimi?
