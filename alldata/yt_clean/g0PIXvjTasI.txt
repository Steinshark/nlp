- [Jimmie] I feel it's one important computers ever built. To me, it was the heart of the mission. We wouldn't have went to the moon without the Apollo Guidance Computer. This may be the only time is powered up, because this It's not just like we plug it in and go. It's going to be a real monumental, it's a monumental task, I would say. - Okay. Three, two, one, zero. We are impatiently awaiting the arrival of the Apollo Guidance that guided, basically, man to the moon. And we have a rare opportunity - [Reporter] This is Marc Verdiell. He's Chief Technology called Samtec and lives in Silicon Valley. But his real passion is He has a popular YouTube videos like this. - [Marc] Woo-hoo! It's doing something weird! - [Reporter] That's what led restoration project yet, and Jimmie Wayne Loocke. Loocke was hunting for electronic parts in an industrial area when he happened upon a warehouse that was looking to sell for scrap metal. - As soon as I walked into the place, I started looking around that I recognized as being - [Reporter] Loocke had actually worked briefly at NASA in Houston and so he was familiar - [Marc] Basically, he bought not having a really good And eventually, he found out that in the pile of scrap he had, there was this Apollo Guidance Computer, which is the gem of his collection. - [Reporter] For decades, he let the Apollo Guidance gather dust in storage until, one day, he decided to dig the machine out and to figure out what it was for. He was stunned by what he discovered. The electronic box he assumed was junk had actually been used to for the missions that first - [Narrator] This guidance will be mounted in an Apollo spacecraft to aid our three to the moon and return. - [Reporter] Loocke soon found out that the Apollo Guidance Computer, or AGC, was at the time the most ever built. It was the first computer the backbone of modern electronics. It was the world's first general the first to fly, and the directly depended. Only a few were built, and these innovative moon machines. But still, he didn't know until he went to a space a space flight software engineer fascinated with the vintage machine, who then connected him with Verdiell and his small crew of And soon, the plan was hatched. This unlikely group and power up an Apollo Guidance Computer for the first time since the - [Neil] One giant leap for mankind. - [Marc] Ooh. Sorry guys, I have camera in hand. - [Reporter] The team checked into a hotel, into a makeshift laboratory, where they spent a week documenting the process on - [Marc] Well, should we bow? This is the holy computer. - [Reporter] But they needed so they asked Loocke to fly to Several months later, Loocke arrived at Verdiell's home laboratory - That's still freaking heavy. - [Reporter] And the crew - It's still there! - [Reporter] The task ahead was daunting. They had to work twelve hours a day for almost fourteen straight days. - I have news for you. The pins are corroded and damaged, and I'm trying to figure out the extent of the damage. - How are they looking, Marc? - [Marc] Not good. - [Reporter] They dissected the machine, ran every diagnostic test they could, cleaned memory cores, racing to power on the computer and attempt a test flight. - We all would like to and then build a rocket but we can't quite do that. The next step is to fly part of the mission and repeat what the astronauts were doing with the computer. - [Reporter] After nearly they'd reached the moment of truth. The crew gathered in Verdiell's to try and power on the AGC and attempt a test flight mission. - Three, two, one, zero. 2.27. Oh, it's running. - Yeah, we got a display. - [Marc] On its own memory? - Yeah, on its own memory. (cheering and applauding) - [Marc] We have almost landed. For us, it's the equivalent - [Mike] This is the anybody has turned this computer on, any computer of this model, and operated it. And the burn has started, so it's now trying to fire the engine. This second register here altitude rate. This is pretty much identical to what they would have seen on the real mission. - [Reporter] For his part, will help a younger generation helped astronauts fly to the moon, and, in the process, helped pave the way for the advanced computers - We need to preserve the legacy of this computer. In other words, future generations need to understand 200 years from now. I want them to be able to see the Apollo Guidance Computer. (bright music)
