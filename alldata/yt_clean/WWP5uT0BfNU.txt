I'm walking with my dog Bao Bao by the roadside. We hear a faint cry, desperate and constant. A puppy is crying for help, and it breaks my heart. We follow the sound and find the tiniest puppy. It's so small, I can hardly believe it. What kind of dog is this? It's too little to be alone. There's no sign of its mother, and it seems abandoned. The poor thing is starving, trembling in hunger. It can't be more than ten days old. No teeth, eyes barely open. I don't think it will survive without help. I'm worried it's too fragile, especially around the bigger dogs at my home. I decide it's best to give it away. My sister agrees to take care of it. But Bao Bao doesn't want to let it go. He cuddles the puppy close, protecting it. The little pup also keep following him around. I don't have experience raising tiny puppies. My puppies have always had their mother by their side. This little one is different. Plus, while running the camp, I don't have time to constantly watch over it. If I'm not careful, it could easily get hurt by wandering near the bigger dogs. Raising a puppy takes more than just feeding it. It needs constant care and attention. I want what's best for it. A good home with a responsible owner is what it needs. The new owner already has newborn puppies. They're willing to take this one in too. I know it's the right decision. But I see that Bao Bao really, really loves the little puppy. He always wants to kiss and play with it, just like it's his own son. He wants to protect the little puppy and be with it forever. My sister's Golden Retriever just had newborn puppies. She's happy to take in this tiny one too. But the mother dog doesn't have enough milk for all of them. So, my sister feeds the little puppy with goat milk formula. Her house is full of dogs, and it gets busy. After feeding, she gently places the puppy in its own crate to keep it safe. My dog Bao Bao, a baby weighing over a hundred pounds, seems so sad. He really misses the little puppy! I visit a friend's house for a meal, They gift to me a puppy, already a month old, into my arms, leaving it all alone. I try to refuse, saying I already have too many dogs at home. But they know I love dogs, and soon enough, it's in my car. So, I ended up bringing it home, and Bao Bao is very happy to see it. Bao Bao has the best temperament of all the dogs I've raised. All the puppies love him, and even the little lamb likes to sleep next to him. Last night, I searched for the little puppy for a long time, and later found it sleeping on Bao Bao's tail. In the afternoon, I gave Bao Bao a piece of beef bone, but I noticed he didn't eat it. The little puppy was chewing on it beside him. Bao Bao just watched and never tried to take it away. Bao Bao is really such a good dog. The male clumsy dog, Bao Bao, tenderly cares for the baby. He hugs it just like he did with the puppy, overflowing with love. It's heartwarming to see how gentle and protective he is. Mongolian Mastiff Bao Bao is a young foster father, and he embraces his role with joy. Together, they create a heartwarming bond that fills each day with laughter and love. Little puppy Hao Hao refuses to sleep inside the house. She loves curling up on her father's belly instead. It's such an adorable sight to see her snuggled there. The warmth between them fills my heart with joy. The large female dog from my herder friend's place died, My herder friend brought me these two puppies without a mother. All the animals at home are curiously watching them. Bao Bao tries to nurse the puppies. He lies down to let the puppies suckle, but unfortunately, he chews up the milk and has none to give. We care for the two little puppies with so much love. It fills our hearts with joy to see them growing healthy. Each day, they become more beautiful. Bao Bao and Hao Hao wag their tails in excitement. They love having the little ones around. Our home feels warmer and happier with their playful energy. We cherish every moment with these adorable puppies. Mongolian Mastiff Bao Bao is the best caregiver to the puppies. His gentle nature shines as he cuddles and plays with them. You can see the love in his eyes; he truly adores these little ones. It's snowing in Hulunbuir. My dear children love playing in the snow! I feel immense joy watching little Hao Hao grow up with Bao Bao. They all play together, full of energy and happiness. Their playful barks fill the air, creating a warm atmosphere. It warms my heart to see them healthy and thriving as a family.
