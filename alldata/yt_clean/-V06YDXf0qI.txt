[English subtitles are available] It got away. Isn't it dead? Where's the boar? Ah. [The wolves] Jingwen. It's okay. Calm down. How many times has she gone mad on this trip? - Jingwen. Can you be professional? Shut up. - How could you say that? Just sleep with your earphones on. I found it for you. What? Okay. Okay. - You wanna pick a fight? Fate brought us together. Sit down and have a rest. Alright, sit down. I'll sit here with her. So impatient. I hope it won't affect his expedition. It's okay. Don't be nervous. It's okay. Please sit down. Fasten your seat belt. Jingwen. Fasten your seat belt. Yes. Run! Help! Help! Get in the cabin. Put on whatever you can wear. Okay. Or we'll get hypothermia soon. Help! Professor, I'm here. Help me. Professor, your hat. Wait. Lucky me. - This is my life. Go. Alas. There are only a few people survived the plan crash. There was an explosion just now. The plane was disintegrated. I'm the only one left in the security team. Ethnic studies trip turned into a flight to hell. Are we the only ones left? I've counted. We are the only ones left, if you don't count the dead. It's been 18 hours. Gosh. There's no signal here. We can only save ourselves. Are we going to die here? No. What are you babbling about? So childish. - Why didn't you fall to death? Say it again. You think I wouldn't dare? Alright. Enough. We're colleagues. Stop arguing. Harmony brings wealth. I guess it's getting dark soon. Let's find something to burn. Or we're not gonna make it through the night in frigid temperatures. You're a stupid biology expert. Don't boss us around. Stop acting like a boss. I won't listen to anyone. If you have time to quarrel, you'd better find some supplies. Cans. Hahaha. Let's go back to the cabin. I'll go over there and look for more. Money! Money! Stop! This is Euro. It's so cold. It's a good thing we built a fire. I wish we had skewers now. Where's Qian Bin? Where is Qian Bin? I saw him just now. It takes him an hour to pee. A pain in the ass. Let's go find him. Let's go. Torch. It's not ancient times. Seriously? Torches can be used for more than just lighting. Nonsense. OK, off you go. I'll accompany Jingwen. Jingwen, be good. I'll tell you a story of 9527. Okay? Qian Bin. Qian! Qian Bin. Qian Bin! Qian! Qian Bin! Qian! - Where is he? Qian Bin! - Where is he? Where have you been? Qian Bin! Qian! Qian Bin. Qian Bin! Qian Bin! Qian Bin! Qian Bin! Qian Bin! Qian Bin! What's that sound? Is it a wolf? Look! So scary. Why is the wolf so tall? What should we do? Don't be afraid. Look at its eyes. If you are afraid, the wolf will know. The wolf doesn't dare to come near. Because all animals are afraid of fire. Is it trying to come over? Hurry up, go back to the cabin. Yes, go back to the cabin. Hurry up. Don't move. If the wolf finds you scared, it will come at you. Should we just stand here and wait for death? Don't be afraid. I'm here. All right, the wolf is gone. Build more fires. Go back! Hurry! Run! Wait for me! Go, Baozi. Hurry up! I was frightened out of my wits! What's that outside? It must be a wolf. We were almost eaten by the wolf. That's not an ordinary wolf. It has two chins. Its chins are cracked. I've never seen an animal fossil like that. I think it could be a genetic mutation. A genetic mutation? A giant wolf? Yes, it's so big. It scared the hell out of me. If it's not a single case, there must be a pack of mutant giant wolves. It's so... A pack? Tell me. Sir, it could be a new subspecies. Arctic wolves usually live in packs of 5 to 10. Even if they mutate, they should still be social animals. In winter, the number of a pack will increase to 30. - 30? But only one attacked us just now. So I don't think the mutant wolf just now belongs to a very large pack. What if the wolf attacks us later? Wolves are very territorial. They haven't come for us by now, which means we're out of their hunting range. We're safe for now. 30? What a pity. I didn't film it. It wasn't recorded. Professor, I don't think this is a good time. We had backed away. So tonight, the wolves might attack us. We'll take shifts tonight. Change shifts every hour. I'll be the first. My shift now. You should take a rest. Don't fall asleep. Jingwen... Autism and mania. Two years ago, I was doing research on wolves with her mother in the Alps. We got caught in an avalanche, and we fell off a cliff. In the end, I failed to save her mother. That bracelet was the last gift her mother left her. After that, she never said a word. She doesn't even talk to me. She couldn't go to school. I have to keep her by my side. I wish I could hear her call me dad again. Professor. You should rest now. I want to do some reading. Is that the sound of the mutant wolves? If I go out now, I might be able to take pictures of them. Take photos. Take a photo. Where is the professor? Where is the professor, Baozi? Where is the professor? Where's the professor? Where's the professor? -Oh, no! Professor! What? -Professor! -Professor! -Professor! -Professor! Professor! Master! Professor. Professor. He won't leave his notebook like this. He must have been killed. Sir! Sir! These are the footprints of the giant wolves. They must have come back. So the professor was... It's dangerous here. Go back. Go! Hurry. Go back! Go. Professor Ning died miserably. Hey. Didn't you say we should take turns to keep vigil? Where is he? He's dead. Sorry. It's all my fault. It's my fault. Song Wu. I... It's my fault. I... I fell asleep. After what happened last night, they may be bolder. There's a chance they'll come back tonight. Tianqi, how much firewood do we have? I don't think there's enough for tomorrow. If the rescue team doesn't come tomorrow, we'll all die here. How about we take a chance and get out of here. Agreed? Okay, I agree. Let's pack up then. Let's go. Hurry, the forest is ahead. Go. Jingwen. Jingwen. Are you okay? Did you hear that? They're surrounding us! Light the fire and scare them away. Hurry! Right, wolves are afraid of fire. -This way. What are you waiting for? Light the fire! What the hell? It's all wet. How am I supposed to light it? What should we do? I have gasoline. Hurry up, Song Wu! Oh no! They're coming! It seems there are wolves around. Stop talking. Hurry! Fire! Hurry! Hurry. It's on fire. It's on fire. Thank you. Thank you. What should we do then? We'll try our best to avoid them. If there's no escape, we'll fight back. Are you cold? Give me your hand. Are you feeling better now? Do you want hot cocoa? Here, take it. Don't worry. I will be here with you. Is it good? Is it good? Let me have a taste. It's good. Come on. Have a try. Let's share. It'll help to warm your body. You... Why are you so selfish? Because I want to survive. I don't want to be the food of the wolves here. Are you scared? Scared? The one who runs the slowest should be scared. If the big wolf is here, it'll eat you first. Say something, little mute. Don't say that to her anymore. Understand? What? What should we do? Nana. Get some cloth and canned food. Hurry up. How dare you bite me! How dare you scare me! You think you're strong, huh? Come on! Why did you cut its head? Don't look. It's okay. Come and get your brother's head! Hey, don't provoke them. They followed us all the way here. We have to get rid of them. When it's dawn, we'll head south immediately. The cold current in Siberia is blowing south. If we follow the wind, they won't be able to smell our scent so easily. Hurry up. I heard water flowing. We're here. Be careful. It's so high. What should we do? We can't go down. There's a path down there. Can we go? That's a cliff. I can hear the sound of water from here. This river must be huge. If we go this way, we should be able to find people. We can tie a rope here. Then we can go down from here. Could it be dangerous? Yes. But we have no choice. The road is ahead. And the wolves are chasing after us. What decision will you make? We'll hold you. Pull the rope when you arrive. Be careful. Please take care of yourself. Are you ready? Come on. Come on. Come on, bro. Falling to death is better than feeding wolves. It's safe. Come down. Who will go first? Let me go first. It's okay. You go first. I'll watch you. I arrived. Come on, next. What's wrong, baby? Come on. Don't be afraid. Jingwen, come here. Hands up. Alright? Don't be afraid. It's okay. You go first. I'll come right after you. You go first. I'll pull the rope for you. You can catch me down there. Hey, Baozi. Be careful. Okay, we're here. It's okay. Nana, it's okay. Come down. It scared the hell out of me. I thought I just fell. Don't be afraid. We'll get out of here. Give me the rope. Let's tie up together. Feeling better now? Don't look down. Hold my hand. Don't look down. Nana, don't look down. Hold my hand. Oh no, the snowstorm is coming. We have to leave now. Jingwen, be careful. Ah, Nana! Help! Don't let go! Hold on. Don't let go. Hurry up! Baozi, hurry up! We can't hold on any longer. Hurry up. If we can't get her up, we'll fall down together. Hold my hand. Be careful, Baozi. Don't let go. If we can't get her up, we'll all die here! Nana, stop! Stay alive. Nana. Nana. Don't be afraid. We'll get out of here. You go first. I'll pull the rope for you. Don't let go. You can catch me down there. Nana. Cheer up. Hurry up! Let's go. Let's go. Are we almost at the bottom of the valley? We're less than 10 meters from the water. Hang in there. Hurry. The wind is too strong. We can't go further. The snow must be thick down there. It's only ten meters away. Let's jump! Jingwen. Jingwen. Are you alright? Song Wu. Baozi, what happened? You're finally awake. You've been in a coma for two days. The chief saved us. Thank you for saving us. Saving one life earns more merit than building a pagoda of seven stories. You speak Chinese? Forty years ago, there was an expedition team from Siberia. Some of them could speak Chinese. Did they stay here? One day, they moved out overnight. Their lab became wolves' lair. Are you referring to the huge wolves? Yes. Those wolves weren't like this before the expedition team came. The first wolf's lair is on that mountain. Chief, it seems like their range of activity was close to the village. How did you resist the wolves? Let's go. I'll show you. Those wolves had been living in this cave. Yes. They won't come out during the day. They only prey at night. We'll light a fire circle outside the cave and drive them away. But as the wolves keeps growing and mutating, the fire circle has started to be useless to them. Many villagers have died here in recent years. These are the equipment we found after they left. -This gun... -This gun... Isn't this 98K? There are explosives here. With these weapons, we won't be afraid of those wolves. But we don't know how to use them. I know. I'll teach you. I'm going to kill all of you! 54137, it's a satellite phone! Make the call! It's out of battery. Let's see if there's a battery. Hurry up. Have you found it? This examination team has everything except for the battery. The screen lit up. Hello? Hello, can you hear me? This is International Rescue Center. Hello. Hello? No, the signal is too bad here. Let's go outside. Let's go tomorrow morning. We have guns. We don't know if there will be a signal tomorrow. Take care of Jingwen for me. Take this walkie-talkie. Be careful. We'll wait for you. It's so cold. Why is it so dark? Why is the fire out? Stay inside and don't come out. I'll go outside and see what's going on. Song Wu, how are you? It's okay. Let's try again. Hello, what's going on? Jingwen. What's happening there? -There's a signal! -This is the International Rescue Center. Hello? Can you hear me? This is the International Rescue Center. There are four of us. No, 20 of us. Okay, we found your location. We'll pick you up at 9 the day after tomorrow. The day after tomorrow? 9 a.m. the day after tomorrow? Okay. We're saved. We're saved! Wolf! Wolf! Jingwen was taken by the wolf. Just now, the wolves attacked the village. Many villagers died. Jingwen. Jingwen. Jingwen. Why? What's going on? Our children were captured, too. If someone hadn't provoked the wolves, they wouldn't have attacked the village. How dare you bite me! If a wolf returns, it's either repaying kindness or revenge. I'm going to the wolf's lair. You will die. That's my daughter. We'll help you. Look, this is the map I drew. Jingwen should still be in the lair. If we wanna save Jingwen, I have two ways. First, we attack head-on. Kill all the wolves and get into the lair to rescue Jingwen and the kids. OK. Let's do it. Isn't it too dangerous? I have another way. Use this. This is a heat detector. I remember the chief once told us about the habit of the wolves not going out during the day. We should be at the entrance early in the morning to make bait with jerky. You two use the heat bio-detector. As soon as you see the wolves leaving the lair, we'll go in. I'll rescue Jingwen and the boy. When the wolves come to the food trap, the explosives left by the scientific examination team will blow them up. Can we really detect them? Targets are all at Point B. We can continue. Roger. I'm going into the lair now. Let's proceed as planned. And now? Do it! Did you hear the explosion? No. No? Damn! The bomb failed. The fuse of the bomb is broken. They were bitten by the wolves. The wolves are approaching Song Wu. Song Wu! Song Wu! Get out of the lair! Get out! The wolves! The wolves are heading towards you again! Didn't you say the plan worked? The bomb failed. There's no time to explain. Get out of there. No, I must keep going. Save my daughter! Song Wu! Song Wu! Get out of the lair! Get out of there, Song Wu! Run! Damn it! Baozi, look. Look, why did the wolves disperse? Where is Song Wu? He's moving. [Laughing] I'm fine. Let's move on. I just crawled out of the stinky water pit. The smell of dead bodies covered my scent. [Laughing] No, I have to help Song Wu. I have to help him. This is the nuclear test base. This is nuclear waste, nuclear weapon. Come out! Did you see a little girl in a red cloak? Do you understand what I said? Song Wu, I'm here. Hurry up! -Hello. -Please confirm the landing point of tomorrow's flight. Okay. We will launch a signal bomb to pin our location. OK. We can make phone calls now. It's the International Rescue Team. They found our location. They're on their way. Okay. We're back. Why did only you and him come back? Where are Baozi and your daughter? I didn't find my daughter. And Baozi... I'm here. Baozi. Baozi! Great! -Baozi! -Great! I knew you would be fine. The International Rescue Team called. We can leave now. Yes. Great! Great! Baozi. Baozi, what happened to your back? Baozi. Baozi. Baozi. It's the wolf. Baozi. Don't be sad. Someone has to cover you. Someone has to die earlier. You were always the cool guy. Now, it's finally my turn. You'll be fine. You will be fine. -It's okay. -I know if I can make it this time. Bro, am I a hero? Yes. I'm a hero. A hero. I saw Jingwen when I got out of the lair. She was hiding in the corner. But Uncle Baozi couldn't save her. You have to get her back. Baozi! Baozi! Baozi! Baozi! I'm sorry. I'm so useless. I'm really useless, Baozi. Sorry. Sorry. Let me do it. Take a rest. Sorry. Baozi. These wolves have wisdom. They caught the kids and use them as hostages to lure us into the lair to fight to the death. If we don't go, they will come to the village again. We can't escape this battle. Tianxing, you and the villagers plant explosives in the lair. I'll go in and save my daughter. If I can't come out in 10 minutes, you detonate the bomb and blow up the lair. Remember, don't wait. Just 10 minutes. Come on! Cover me! Behind you! Go save your daughter. Be careful. This is the clue left by Jingwen. Hurry up. Is the line connected? Yes. Okay. Did you do as I said? Yes. Countdown starts now. Jingwen. Jingwen. Jingwen. Jingwen. Jingwen. Wake up. Wake up. How is it? It's been ten minutes. Why isn't he back yet? I believe he will be back. Bastard! Look here. Come on! Run! Jingwen, are you alright? Are you hurt? Are you hurt? That's good. Dad.
