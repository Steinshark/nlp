(music) A SERGIO &amp; RHODA IN ISRAEL (Sergio) <i>So, full disclosure.</i> <i>Sometimes, on this channel,</i> <i>we find ourselves in <i>Whether it's ancient burial chambers,</i> <i>mysterious passageways,</i> <i>or just places we maybe shouldn't be.</i> - <i>Ah!</i> <i>But, when you're <i>and ancient archaeological sites,</i> <i>sometimes you come across <i>and some dark moments in history.</i> <i>It's just part of the story.</i> <i>But, sometimes, <i>and enjoy some amazing places,</i> <i>so today's episode is meant to be fun.</i> Whoa! <i>It has hiking, dancing, singing...</i> (buzzer) <i>...animals...</i> There he is!

So, this is the Tower (deep voice) The Eye of the Sauron. (Rhoda) <i>What is the Eye of the Sauron?</i> (dramatic music) ASHALIM SOLAR THERMAL POWER STATION NOT THE EYE OF SAURON! (deep voice) The Eye of the Sauron. <i> Oh, the mountains, <i>Oh, desert mountains,</i> <i>they call us home</i> <i>Oh, desert mountains,</i> <i>how long we go</i> <i>Oh, desert mountains,</i> <i>that's where we go</i> (Rhoda) <i>That was so beautiful.</i> - (chuckles) (music) <i>Our first stop for the day <i>or Nitzana Hillocks,</i> <i>which is located very close All right, there we go. <i>&quot;Nizzana Hill Rocks...&quot; Hillocks! - Hamukei is a hillock. - I don't know. It's a Hamukei. We'll find out in our research (Rhoda) <i>There is the border!</i> - (gasps) Whoa! <i>We're so close to it.</i> <i>That is so exciting!</i> - Let's go take a look. (Sergio) <i>Wow! Look at that.</i> - (Rhoda) <i>That is so cool!</i> (Rhoda) <i>Whoa!</i> That's just chalk. Let's go a little bit out there - (Rhoda) <i>Wow! They're so pretty.</i> I don't think we've ever been - It looks like ice. (Rhoda) <i>That's what it looks like.</i> - (Sergio) <i>Ice in the middle of a desert.</i> (Sergio) <i>Wow! (music) <i>These white, smooth, little hills Whoa! It is way harder - (Rhoda) <i>Mm-hmm.</i> - (Rhoda) <i>Oh!</i> <i>They are made of pure chalk,</i> <i>which gives this area It's pretty steep, (Rhoda gasps) <i>You made it with flipflops!</i> Wow! <i>The wind, sun, and rain shaved these hills <i>like crowns and mushrooms.</i> <i>It's an incredible spot for nature lovers Little steps. - Whoa-ho-ho! - I'm alive. (Sergio chuckles) You know, the only thing - Mhm? - (Sergio laughs) So, it's better to come here not in summer, not in August. Uh, I think I've seen enough here. - Let's go see the ancient farm. (Sergio) <i>Starting at the end <i>Nabataean farmers that provided food <i>created unique ways <i>in the middle of the desert <i>The ancient farm we are visiting next</i> <i>is an example of that desert farming.</i> - (Rhoda) <i>There's like a little shaded area.</i> <i>We have shaded parking - (Rhoda) <i>Just for us.</i> (Rhoda) <i>Thank you, Lord.</i> (car beeps) - Ancient farm. - <i>Is this ancient, or it looks, right?</i> But it looks like (Sergio) <i>Yeah. Probably restored, There's an olive tree! I don't see any watering. Somehow, I can get the olive tree. What is this tree, and how can (Rhoda) <i>Yeah, I don't know but this is an olive, this is an olive. That's an olive, that's an olive, But, this one, I don't know what it is. <i>It's cool, though. <i>and then it's symmetrical almost.</i> <i>Babe! There's a deer!</i> - (Sergio gasps) - (Sergio) <i>There! There! There!</i> <i>Wow! Look! Wow! I want to see more of them. - (Sergio) <i>I'm gonna run.</i> Yeah. I'm gonna hunt with the gazelle. Hunt with the gazelles, <i>There he is! There he is!</i> <i>There was a little one, right here, It looked like Bambi. (music) <i>Wow, is that thing fast.</i> Where is it? <i>By that school, <i>more of the farm, whatever it is, And, maybe some of the water maybe there's some so the water can stay and maybe that's why - But, it was so cool, little deer. <i>And I see all these footsteps, As you said, they just vanish. But, there's so many footsteps - It's so cool. It's so exciting. <i>I want to read what that tree was.</i> Oh, there is a sign here, and I think it says - (Rhoda) <i>What does it say?</i> - Tena. Fig tree. - Tena. That's what it says. (Rhoda) <i>But Tena leaves are like that. Thank you for pointing that out to me. In my naivety, I would have (Rhoda laughs) (music) (Sergio) <i>After visiting <i>more research taught us <i>may have been used to collect <i>That's incredible when you consider <i>But, here, these structures were used <i>Wow, this was really, really cool,</i> and that deer was just - It was really refreshing. All right. Let's head - Yeah. Let's go see Nessana, the city. (music) <i>So, we are off to Nessana itself,</i> <i>the ancient ruins of a city <i>which, over the centuries <i>the Romans, and the Byzantine Christians</i> <i>who built a monastery <i>and, believe it or not, Saint Sergius.</i> <i>And, apparently, Sergius's name I see the steps. - (Sergio) <i>Yeah.</i> - Ancient steps. I thought the steps so people could go up there. - (Sergio) <i>Maybe reconstructed.</i> (music) (Sergio) <i>That's a lot of steps to go up.</i> - Mm-hmm. Well, what do you want to do first: the pillars or the steps? (music) Let's check out the pillars. - Okay, 'cause they're here. (Rhoda) <i>Wow!</i> I can't believe how well These are the actual? (Sergio) <i>No, it's the actual.</i> <i>So, this would be the alter area.</i> Very similar to what we've seen that we've done (Rhoda) <i>Yeah, (Sergio) <i>Yeah, and also columns.</i> - Yeah, babe, look. - That's how this slab-- What does this remind you of? <i>It reminds me of Beit She'an,</i> <i>that Roman town we went to - <i>This would be it, right, part of it?</i> - I'm not sure. I'll put it back. (music) <i>This is some sort of And I see water at the bottom, <i>It stinks a little bit.</i> But, it's so cool. <i>It's like 50 meters down?</i> (Sergio) <i>Okay. I guess, Let's go up there. Wow. (music) (Rhoda breathing heavily) Wow! Wow. Look at the size of this place. (music) - <i>Look at that view!</i> Look at that view. - <i>Is that Egypt?</i> That's the northern? We are in an ancient monastery. This one is called if you've heard of those two guys-- dating back to the Byzantine era. It's like, what, fifth to seventh century. This is phenomenal that it's still and we're gonna show it to you today. (Rhoda) (quietly) Wow. <i>There's another building up there, (Sergio) <i>Yeah. So, that's the other building.</i> <i>There's the south one, and I believe this one is the monastery where one of the rooms was Sergius's. - No way. - Where is Sergius? Which room would you choose? Well, actually, they say the whole and one of the rooms - We've gotta find it. All right. Let's go find it. (Sergio) <i>Okay. If I was Sergius,</i> where would my room be? Where would I inscribe my name? I like the sunset's view more So, I bet my room would be somewhere and my inscription It should be on a slab, they say. (music) (Rhoda) <i>Be careful, Sergius.</i> (Sergio) <i>Babe, I think <i>'cause this looks like What is this? Look at this. It's a beautiful view. <i>Here, you see a cross? (Rhoda) <i>Yeah, I see it.</i> (Sergio) <i>I feel like <i>But I'm not sure. - (Rhoda) <i>I'm gonna check the other ones.</i> Okay. If I was Sergius, <i>I don't want it too big, but not too small so it's invisible. I'm still looking for it. (Sergio) <i>What is in here?</i> Whoa. That looks cool. So, I feel like, because this monastery I have the right to just move in. - What do you think? - Yeah. and keep the standing stones, and really keep its authenticity? - Oh, that would be so good. (Sergio gasps) <i>No way!</i> (Rhoda) <i>A modern inscription of your name.</i> <i>What a cool door.</i> Wow! What a cool place. <i>And you have the best views.</i> - (Sergio) <i>This is the northern church.</i> So, the inscription of Sergius (Rhoda) <i>Look at those niches. - Yeah, yeah. Whoa. Okay. This makes sense, right? It's all mixed with modern inscriptions, Yeah, it could have been anywhere here. We didn't find the inscription. Well, we know it's here. We know this monastery, was dedicated to Sergius. And, here we are, 1,500 years later, standing on this very ground. With a Sergius. (music) (Sergio) <i>We may not <i>but we were not about to leave <i>with the FPV Drone.</i> <i>The overhead views are are amazing,</i> <i>but they also revealed <i>an additional part of the site (Rhoda) <i>Wow! There's another one!</i> How cool is that? Okay, so, I'm gonna see if the inscription is there, - (Rhoda) <i>Okay.</i> - I'll just go down this. - You have to be careful here. <i>Careful, honey, careful!</i> (footsteps scraping) (Sergio exhales, chuckles) - (Rhoda) <i>You did it!</i> (Sergio) <i>Yeah, but let me (music) <i>Whoa!</i> <i>Like a mosaic-type of stone.</i> - (Rhoda) <i>I'm coming.</i> Oh, she's going down. <i>I'm coming. I'm gonna help you.</i> (Rhoda) <i>No, no, no. (Sergio) <i>Like this, sideways.</i> <i>Sideways.</i> - <i>You got it?</i> <i>Thank you, honey.</i> - There is mosaic. - (Rhoda) <i>But that's a bit mosaic.</i> (Rhoda) <i>I think Babe, come look. - <i>Whoa!</i> - Wait, you have a flashlight. <i>Ewww!</i> <i>Ooh. Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i> <i>Pigeons? What is this?</i> (Rhoda) <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I think that the &quot;Danger&quot; sign - (Sergio) <i>There are two eggs.</i> - (Sergio) <i>There are two eggs.</i> - (Sergio) <i>Right there.</i> There are gonna be pigeon babies. <i>Oh, there. Ha ha.</i> <i>Oh, she's worried for them. <i>That is so cool, though.</i> (music) (Sergio) <i>Wow. This is wonderful.</i> and just all the adventure, the animals, the ancient ruins, It's so beautiful, even now, <i>It's just so quiet and gorgeous.</i> But, okay, before we call it a day, I say we still try to make it to that hieroglyph ancient - But it's dark. It's better in the dark. - We do. And that's what makes it fun. You like it when I'm scared - (Sergio laughs) (Sergio) <i>We are off to explore <i>used by the Nabataeans <i>to build the city of Nessana.</i> (Rhoda) <i>It's cool. (Sergio) <i>The real reason <i>is because of the recent reports <i>of prehistoric petroglyphs.</i> <i>All right.</i> (car door closes) <i>It's really dark out here.</i> (Rhoda) <i>Do you see there are people there?</i> - (Sergio) <i>Yeah. Yeah.</i> (Rhoda) <i>Do snakes come out at this hour?</i> (Sergio) <i>Okay. Remember when I said <i>except for a little tiny bit at the end?</i> (scary music) <i>Well, this is that tiny little bit,</i> <i>which, maybe you can tell <i>But, imagine we didn't use scary music</i> <i>but some other style (upbeat music) (Sergio) <i>Uh... no. I don't think so.</i> (Rhoda) <i>Do snakes come out at this hour?</i> - All right. - Ow! - Wow, this is crazy. - There you go. <i>Like that.</i> - <i>Babe?</i> <i>This is not a very good idea, (Sergio) <i>Yeah. If it's not here, <i>If anything comes at us, Actually, there is enough rocks, (Rhoda) <i>Babe, be careful, please.</i> - (Sergio) <i>There is a road here.</i> (Sergio) <i>Yeah, right here. - I think this road goes directly to it. Look how close we are right now. Look. - <i>There it is.</i> - (Rhoda) <i>Yeah, I think so.</i> <i>Yeah, I see it.</i> (Rhoda) <i>What if there are animals I've got a rock, just in case, (Rhoda) <i>There are bats coming out of it.</i> (animal clicking) - (Rhoda gasps) <i>Babe?</i> - (Rhoda) <i>Something jumped on my hand.</i> (Rhoda) <i>Yeah. - (Sergio) <i>I see something flying.</i> (whispering) <i>Oh, gosh, it's so scary.</i> (Sergio) <i>Wow! This is insane.</i> <i>I see pigeons but no bats.</i> <i>Do you see this square corner? - (Rhoda) <i>Oh, gosh.</i> - (Rhoda) <i>Babe, it looks like it collapsed.</i> (Rhoda) <i>Lord, protect us, please.</i> (music) (Sergio) <i>Ancient wall right here.</i> (Sergio gasps) (Rhoda) <i>All pigeons. All pigeons.</i> (Sergio) <i>What we are looking for <i>reportedly seen by visitors of this cave <i>However, it appears as if the cave <i>and some of them have been destroyed.</i> - (Rhoda) <i>Babe, wait. It goes deeper.</i> (Rhoda) <i>Look how deep it goes.</i> - <i>So, I bet the calligraphy is in there.</i> <i>Hey, I don't think it's a good idea <i>There is a wall. - And there is some humidity of some sort. - <i>Yeah, we're gonna call this one.</i> <i>There is something walking on the walls, (Sergio) <i>Let's go.</i> (Rhoda) <i>Oh, gosh.</i> I think we should head back fast. (Rhoda) <i>All this effort - The Lord is my shepherd. (Sergio) <i>I see the car. - (Rhoda) <i>No.</i> - (Rhoda) <i>Yeah, I see it.</i> (Rhoda) <i>Okay, do you want to (Sergio) <i>No, shortcut.</i> So, what are you thoughts about that cave? Well, from one side, Careful, barb wire. And I really wanted to continue looking - You want to find it, right? But, from the other side, that it's not wise, us alone, without any means of protection or anything. - I had the rock. So, I'm disappointed <i>I'm happy so far that nothing because it looks like barb wire is closing the entry. So, I don't know. What do you feel? It is sad that we did not find but, maybe even in daylight because is just not something Maybe it's somewhere hidden. Wait. Where's the car? - (Rhoda) <i>There. There it is.</i> - (Rhoda) <i>It's hard to see.</i> From this pitch black, it's hard to see. I think the camera sees better than we do. But, if we are not using flashlights, - our eyes would get used to the Moon. (flashlight clicks)<i> (Rhoda) <i>The stars.</i> <i>You can see them.</i> (music) - (Sergio) (whispers) <i>Wow.</i> - (Sergio) <i>All right. Let's go.</i> (Sergio) <i>Where is the light? Yay. We made it. Okay. Now the adventure is done. - Yeah. (both) Thank You, Lord. We are safe. We are back. I'm so beat. Are you beat? - And hungry. Well, we hope you guys enjoyed this video And we hope to see you next time. - And the best is yet to come. - Bye. (audio logo)
