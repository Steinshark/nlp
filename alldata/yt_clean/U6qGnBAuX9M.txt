Hello friends welcome to new video tutorial in this series of waveform graphs and charts in lab view in this video tutorial I'm going to discuss about displaying single plot on waveform graph in love view so let's get started so waveform graph in lab view can display single plot or multiple plots um so we in this video are going to discuss about plotting single plots on waveform graphs so waveform graphs can display one or more plots of evenly sampled data points so the data points must be evenly sampled that is very important it does not accept unevenly sampled data points um evenly spaced data points is another word for the same thing so if the data points are having different increments then that cannot be plotted on waveform graphs um second thing is it can plot only single valued functions such as Y is equal to FX with points evenly distributed along the x-axis so if a function is multivalued means at the same X we have more than two values or more than even one value two values are also not allowed so single valued functions can be plotted on waveform graph not multivalued functions and the waveform graph can display any number of data points as far as the data type allw so displaying a single plot on waveform graph uh when we are going to plot the data on waveform graph we must provide the data to the waveform graph in the form of 1D array of values so it interprets that array values as Y data points and plots that data points onto the graph the X values are starting from the index zero and it automatically increments by one and it plots keeps on plotting the array values incrementing by one on the x-axis and till uh all the Y values are plotted corresponding to X indexes so this is the way by uh by default uh which waveform graph in lab view uses to plot the data so here I have a waveform graph I have uh uh generated random data over here this is a loop for Loop which is generating uh 10 um random data and this data is getting uh accumulated over here this is the this is the auto index index tunnel and uh here the array is getting formed and the data will store in the array and the same data will be plotted onto the waveform graph the increments will be one by default and the initial value will be x0 and uh then uh all the Y values generated over here will be plotted corresponding to different X values the first value would be plotted Ed at index 0er then at index one next value then next value index 2 next value index 3 and so on till all the values are plotted since 10 values are generated so 10 values are plotted from 0 to 9 so let's see I'm sorry so this is the first value this is 1.16 so this is plotted over here 1.16 as shown in the cursor so 1.16 is plotted here then the next value is this one so let me take the cursor Legend over here next value is 1.99 so 1.99 is plotted at x equal to index 1 then the next value is 0.43 which is plotted at index 2 2 the next value is 7.61 which is plotted to the index three and so on different values are plotted according to different X indices so automatically X indices increment by one and the values are plotted now we are going to display single plot on waveform graph with some specific start index and specific X increment so for this we have to make a cluster of initial value x0 uh from where the graph starts plotting the single plot and there is an increment deltax by which the X scale is spaced between various Y data so then uh another thing in the cluster is array of Y data so this cluster we provide to the waveform graph to plot the data so the data would be plotted starting from the index x0 and it increments by the value of delta X and it keeps on plotting the Y values or array values corresponding to X indexes till all the Y values are plotted so let's see in the program now I'm going to plot the data with a specific increment and a specific start X index so here I have bundled to create a cluster x0 is the starting index which is is 7 and Delta X is the increment which is 0.1 and array is the Y values which are generated from here is the data to be plotted and all these three are bundled together to form the waveform graph so let's run this function now see the data is plotted and the First Data is 7.2 so it is plotted at position 7 on the X index the next data is 2.4 7864 2.4 let's say so it is plotted here so what is this point this is 7.1 X index is 7.1 so 7.1 has plotted the data 2.4 the next data is plotted here which is is 0.31 it is plotted at index 7.2 the next data is 1 Point uh yeah 1.84 it is plotted at index 7.3 then next data is plotted at 7.4 next data 7.5 7.6 7.7 7.8 and 7.9 all the 10 data generated are plotted I can even show it better by just dragging the graph a bit now suppose I change this x0 suppose I change it to 5 and change the deltax to let's say 0.5 so let's say how the plotting is done see the plotting has changed the increment has changed I have to write 0.5 I wrote five again increment has changed so I have to right let's say 0.5 so see all the increments have changed 5 5.5 6 6.5 and so on if I say uh X scale Auto scale I remove and I say zero and I say 10 then see the shifting of the data suppose now I say 0.1 increment then the data would be plotted from 5 to 6 now if I say the data has to be plotted from let's say two value and the increment is five so data would be plotted like this like this so this is the way how you can specify a particular X initial value and a particular increment in lab view uh waveform graph to plot the data so this is the end of the video uh thanks for watching this video stay tuned for more videos on this channel thanks once again
