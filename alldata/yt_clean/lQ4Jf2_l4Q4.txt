Do you guys celebrate Halloween? Not really. I don't celebrate Halloween. Do you guys go trick or treating? I used to trick or treat. Okay. You know the usual. Going around the rich houses. - Hahaha. He knows, he knows. First up, the most popular Halloween candy in the US. Is it a Reese's? Like, what's a singular Reese. Good question. I've never thought of that. Give it a taste. That is good. Yeah? Mmm. It's such a good combination. Yeah, it is. Rico just went all in. All in. Is that all in one? Yeah. All in one. You know you're here to talk about it, right? I really like that. Yeah? So is that peanut butter in the middle? Peanut butter in the inside. I really like peanut butter. Quite mid-tier, to be honest. Mid-tier? Nothing amazing about them. But they're always solid. I don't think they're like, underrated. They're definitely not overrated. I think they're like... Reese's Rated Piece's. Next up, we have... Candy corn. What is that? I've seen memes about these saying how awful it is. You never tried it? Apparently it's like, really bad. It's the worst candy of them all. Oh, they look like teeth, don't they? They look like moldy teeth. Oh. They look like yours to be honest. I heard lots of people hate these, but... Oh, really? Really? I feel like they've got a bit of a bad rep on TikTok. Yeah. What is that? - It's kind of like. What is that? Yeah, it's terrible. I'm glad we don't have that here. Really? The Americans can keep that. Yeah, I'm good, thank you. Okay. I've never had one of these. Feel free. Feel free! Take it all the way. I don't know if they made a mistake. Do you know what I mean? It's just sweet. It's just. It's pure sugar. It does taste a little bit sweet corny. Oh yeah! Like, if you boiled down the sweet corn juice, And added a ton of sugar. Sweet corn juice. A ton of sugar, yeah. It's like if you left a jelly baby out in the sun, for like, two days. That is actually quite accurate. You can just keep going on these. I flipping love them, but these guys aren't impressed. They don't like them. Can you taste the sweet corn flavour? Right at the very end? So I'm eating them so quick, there's no right at the very end. Okay. Next up. Butterfinger. Is that actual butter or is it peanut butter? Well, there's only one way to find out. You never had butter fingers before? Never. Crispety, crunchety, peanut-buttery. Made a lot of words up, didn't they? Yeah. Just to make it sound better. Oh, I love these. So good. Mmm, crunchy. Crispety, crunchety, I think that's fair to say. Okay. I could eat, A whole pack of these. You like them? You're a big fan? I would say a rock with a thin layer of chocolate, and then like another rock. I thought it would be a bit better. It's like too crunchy, I think. It's like a bad version of a Crunchie. If I saw them in a shop, it wouldn't be like... Yeah, it wouldn't be my first instinct to get them. But if you got that at someone's house? - Yeah, yeah. I wouldn't say it's my favourite. Okay. If you went to a rich person's house, and they paid to import it from the USA, would you be happy if you got that in your Halloween basket? I think I would, but my dentist definitely wouldn't. It sticks to your teeth. Like they need to add that on the thing. Stickety. Crispety, crunchety, stickety. That's so good! Next up. Hot tam-males. Hot chamez. Hot tama... Ta-mails. Hot tam-laz. Tam-a-laz. Hot t'males. Hot males. Hot tamale. Hot tamale? Not hot males. Hot males, this isn't Magic Mike. Fierce cinnamon flavoured chewey candy. These could be awful. Oh my gosh, it's like a medicine. I thought cinnamon was something nice you have with... - Pretzels. It looks like tablets. That is a great point. Enter the matrix. Mmm. Oh my gosh, that is perfect sweet. Perfect. Ooh, ooh, ooh, That's spicy. That's spicy. Spicy. Is it? Oh now, it is hot. It tastes like soap. This went south really fast. Never had a spicy sweet in my life. I don't mind that, that's actually alright. It's alright. Yeah? Ehem. You good Rico? Yeah. Have you got any water? Tastes like cinnamon bun with peppery salt on top. Okay, like fiery. People give these to kids? Yeah. We just did. Hot tamales. Next up, a real classic. Oh... No, these do not look nice. How'd you know already? First look. Saltwater taffy. Saltwater? So like, from the sea? It looks like a bath bomb. I do kinda wanna eat a bath bomb when I see it. They look so nice. - They smell tasty. This looks like Play-Doh. If someone gave me that, I'd be really confused. It's why we go to the rich houses. They would never give us this. In several states, this is still... - Do still have to eat this? It's a sweet. Try tasting it. This might be your favourite. No. I don't really like this. Chewy mint. I apologize. No, I don't like it. I had a nice flavour. Yeah, it was good? The worst thing is I've got to swallow it. Chewy. Yeah, very chewy. Sweet. It's quite nice. It's quite good, eh? Mmm. Kinda. A tasty marshmallow. I don't know if it actually does have it in it, But all I could taste is the cinnamon. Oh, you still... I'm not sure if it's from the last one. Oh that tastes of watermelon, I think. Oh, yeah? They're different flavours. That's one of your five a day. That one's good... I hate licorice. Oh, did you choose the licorice one? Yeah, I chose the licorice one. Oh, no. Yeah, it's not that bad. Happy I didn't choose the licorice one. That's actually really nice. Tastes so nice. Wow, is that your favourite so far? Yes, easily. Next up. Ooh, Tootsie Roll. I can just imagine this being like bread. Because they're called rolls? Yeah. Very patriotic with all the... Yeah, with all the American flags? You wouldn't get that in England. No. Is it really chewy? You tell me. Yeah. No, no, no, the toffee's not... This Tootsie Roll's not it. It's like a mixture between caramel and chocolate. Yeah, it's a bit too caramelly. Yeah. I don't like that. Okay. Oh, my days. Not a fan. I don't understand what the flavour's meant to be. Tastes a bit like dirt. Yeah. When's the last time you ate dirt? Oh, it must have been three. Ain't the best I've tried. I taste the industrialness in this. It tastes a bit chemical. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I actually really love that. Yeah? Really? I love those. So chewy. Very, very chewy. They're very good at chewy snacks. There's a lot of chewy sweets. Chewity. Chewity. That's another one for the mini rolls. You're gonna love the next one. Is it something chewy? Milk Duds. Candy made with chocolate and caramel. These are gonna be nice. They look like raisins. Chocolate covered raisins. Are they raisin? No, there's caramel inside. I'm not good with raisins. Man after my own heart. Very chewy. It's like a Mars bar in small balls. I don't know why they call them Milk Duds. They don't really taste much like milk. Yeah. Chocolate tastes a bit weird. Bit like... vomit I think there's more caramel than the actual chocolate. Would you be disappointed if you got that from one of the rich houses? - Yeah. - Out of all the things they could give me. If you didn't really know what this was called, Okay. So milk is not accurate but dud is. Yeah. Next up. Another classic. - Mmm. These are good. Have you guys ever had Twizzlers before? No. You just want a Twizzle it. Giving it a Twizzle. These really divide opinion. No. What? They're good. The aftertaste is alright but. Great demonstration. Dividing opinion. It's like you're eating literally on rubber. Okay. Oh, you finished yours. All in one. Wow. How did you do that? Where did it go? Oh my gosh. It disappeared. Yeah, I like that one. I'm chewing plastic. In a good way? No. Okay. It's a bit like rubbery. Yeah, very, very rubbery. Yeah, like if you gave me a portion of a tyre. Okay. The first taste is just weird and then the aftertaste is quite nice. It tastes like nothing and then with a little, It tastes a bit like leather. And you like that? And you've tasted leather? Chewing leather? You've tasted leather before. I know what you mean. Yeah. There's something satisfying about chewing through it. Like rubbery sort of thing. It's kinda just... I'll have yours if you want. That tastes amazing. It's not bad. But it kind of just feels like I'm eating rope. Yeah. I get the hint of strawberry but... Quite bland isn't it? Yeah. Bland? I love this. I think it's very perfect. Next up. Hershey's. Oh Hershey's. Oh. I've seen these all over. I love Hershey's. - I've heard some horrible people about Hershey's. Everyone hates them which means they're pretty cheap at stores Okay. Oh Hershey's. I've heard a lot about these. I'm going to be honest. I've heard a lot of bad stuff about Hershey's. We're a bit anti-Hershey's in the UK. But I've never had Hershey's so I'm not one to judge. Until now, I guess. No. No? No. What does it taste like? That don't taste like milk chocolate. It's a bit like expired cheese. Expired? Yeah, okay. Expired cheese? I hear you. The milk in milk chocolate has gone a bit off. They ruin chocolate for me. Really? That's what I love about this country. It does chocolate right. And this definitely does it wrong. Why do I feel like this is a political campaign. It just tastes like its made in a lab. Not bad though. And you like that? Yeah. You like that chemically flavour. So it tastes cheap and chemically and that's why you like it. Yeah. Okay, what a review. This has definitely come out like from like science lab. But our chocolate, it feels like it has been growing on a farm. - Yeah. I've just thrown up and you know when you get a feeling... Oh a little sick burp? - Yeah! It would put me off eating chocolate, If our only chocolate was Hershey's. Wow. I think it's controversial, but I think I prefer them over a Cadbury's bar. I think you can be expelled for having that opinion. Okay. I love Cadbury's. This is a good contender to it, I would say. Do people like to eat this? Do they say, &quot;I'm going to buy a Hershey's after school&quot;. Yeah, I mean. Probably not in that accent. &quot;I'm gon' buy a Hershey's&quot;. I think chocolate is sort of an acquired taste. Wherever you grow up with is what you like. If you grew up eating horrible chocolate. Then you love horrible chocolate. I love a good sick burp. Next up. Oh, sour patch kids. They smell great. Yeah, great. Wow, straight in. I love sugar. A mouth full of sugar. These deserve to be sold in the UK. I get these on the way home from school. Do they sell these everywhere in the UK? - Yeah. Yeah, they're like two pounds. You've got to go to the rich houses. Yeah. I could eat these all day. Wow, yeah. You're going back. Are they sour? - Yeah, ish. Mediocre sour. Mediocre sour? We could put everything of one of George's quotes on a poster. Final one. Artificially flavoured. - You're gonna love it. The kind of thing my daughter would want to choose. It looks like unicorn dust. It does. Are you gonna have it all in one? I don't know, should we try it? Can you even do that? Is that possible? Yeah, it will pop all over your mouth. Yeah, your mouth might pop. It might explode. It definitely pops in your mouth. Poppity? Mhmm, poppity. That's a new word. That's really cool isn't it? Can you hear it? -Yeah. Can you? Yeah! It's in my head! It's really entertaining to eat? Oh, wow. Sounds like bonfire. I can still hear it in my ears. It's fun to eat, but the taste isn't for me. Like when I'm chewing on it, It's literally like I'm chewing a bunch of pebbles. Okay. What did you guys think? American Halloween candy. - Yeah. I think better than England. - Yeah. Only if you go to the rich houses. Okay. Rich houses, if you're watching, you know what to import. Supply. High standards. We're expecting high standards. Yeah.
