The Buddha - The Great Teacher! He Who Altered the Historical Roots of Human He did not found Buddhism - Buddhism is a entirely different kind of religion in this He founded a religion beyond religion, initiated this is the greatest root change in the history Before the Buddha, there were many religions, factors. Humanity had not yet matured. When the Buddha appeared, humanity entered The entire human race had not entered that the path, the Buddha opened the gates leading It takes time for humanity to understand that The message of the Buddha is the deepest message No one has done what the Buddha did, in the No one else has emitted that pure fragrance. The founders of other religions, the enlightened The Buddha did not compromise, hence he remained He did not care whether you understood or is reality. He spoke without worrying whether you understood In a sense, this seems harsh; but if viewed The truth must be spoken in its original way. The moment you compromise, the moment you truth loses its soul, it becomes fake, it You cannot bring truth down to human perception; That is the great work of the Buddha. Chapter 1: Remember This: Buddha is Freedom! The Blessed One, Gautama Buddha, commonly the Enlightened One, embarked on the spiritual any ideology. This is an extremely rare phenomenon. The conventional spiritual path, the one you It depends on restraint. It does not transform individuals; it merely It does not liberate; it enslaves. It is suffocating, ugly. Remember this: Buddha is freedom. If you see any Buddhist monk repressing, surely They have imposed their own malady onto the And the Buddha does not adhere to any ideology. He has no ideology because all ideologies And if they belong to the mind, those ideologies No ideology can serve as a bridge to transcend All ideologies must be discarded; only then The Buddha also does not believe in ideals within individuals. Ideals cause division and suffering. You are yourself, but ideals want you to become And you are torn between these two. Ideals create pain, ideals lead to schizophrenia. Only consciousness free from ideologies is And if you are divided, how can you be happy? How can you be silent, how can you know anything A person with ideals will constantly struggle Every moment is a conflict. They live in conflict, they live in a state who they are - whether they are living according They do not trust themselves, they become And once confidence is lost, that person will At that point, they are ready to become a At that point, they are ready to fall into They need someone to tell them who they are. They need an identity. They have forgotten themselves and their essence. The Buddha taught a way of life that is free That's why he does not speak of a Supreme enlightenment, he does not talk about the He does not give you anything to cling to; He even takes away your sense of self. He constantly takes everything away; and ultimately, the &quot;I.&quot; He only leaves emptiness. And this is very difficult. It's difficult because we have completely We only know how to take. We just keep taking and taking. &quot;I take&quot; a wife, &quot;I take&quot; a husband. Even a spouse, you try to &quot;take.&quot; You don't respect others! A wife is not property. You can take a house, but how can you take Languages express what is happening We don't know how to give, how to abandon, Nirvana Is Always There The Buddha takes away all these ideals, takes away something that we find very difficult Leaving behind pure, pristine emptiness. He calls this pure emptiness nirvana. Nirvana is not a goal, but rather the emptiness When you abandon all that has been accumulated, longer a miserly beggar, a clinging parasite, It is always there. Emptiness is always present. You have accumulated so much clutter that Just like in a house, you keep accumulating space, and then there is no emptiness in the One day, even moving around in the house becomes because there is no empty space. But the emptiness hasn't gone anywhere - think go anywhere. You have accumulated too much furniture, chairs, are there - but emptiness doesn't go anywhere. Remove the furniture, the clutter, and emptiness It's hidden beneath the clutter but not destroyed. It doesn't leave the room, even for a moment. The Buddha Does Not Teach You Mysteries The Buddha does not bestow Nirvana upon you The Buddha gives you freedom instead of imposition. The Buddha teaches you how to live - not for to enjoy blessings here and now, in this very He teaches how to live in awareness. Not in the sense that awareness will bring achieve something. It is itself the ultimate result, both a means inner. The Buddha does not teach you mysteries. This must be clearly understood. Human beings belong to this world, yet monks That other world is not really mysterious; a higher form of the world you are living How can you create another world? You only know this world. You can upgrade it, decorate it, remove some beautiful, but this will be a product created Therefore, that other world is no different, It is a continuity. It arises from your mind; it is the play of All scriptures talk about the path of meditation, is nothing but similar stories. It may be printed on artistic paper, with more colorful illustrations, but the story The Buddha Does Not Speak of Another World. He only teaches you how to be here, in this How to always be mindful, aware so that nothing inner emptiness remains unpolluted, uncontaminated; untouched, still pure; so that you can be you. Mystical spirituality is stifling, destructive, The spirituality of the Buddha brings it a the flavor of no future, the flavor of no It's the flower that is here and now. It demands nothing, for it has everything. It simply asks you to become more awake so more. Remember, you only exist to the extent of If you want to exist more, be more aware. Consciousness creates existence. Unconsciousness has no existence. When you are drunk, you are not present. When you fall asleep, you are not present. Can you see it? When you are awake, you have a different quality When awake, you feel the solidity of existence, When not aware, it just slowly fades away, of your existence diminishes. Therefore, the entire message of the Buddha Not for any reason, simply to be aware, because creates you. And it creates you in a way that is very different imagine. It creates you where the 'I' disappears, where shaping you... a pure emptiness, an endless &quot;The Difference Between Buddhism and Traditional Nirvana is a unique concept in the teachings of consciousness, which is liberation from The Buddha used this term, although it was meaning. According to the Buddha, our 'self' is like However, as these desires gradually fade away, universe, leaving no trace of separate existence. In the state of nirvana, all sense of individual from the vast universe. The Buddha chose the term 'nirvana' instead that all affirmative words can evoke a sense must ultimately be liberated. Nirvana does not cause spiritual pollution of all desires. Although the initial sense of hearing the longing, the Buddha believed that this is Words that stir up desire only lead to suffering Nirvana, on the contrary, brings absolute The Buddha emphasized that we should be ready the absence of the self, nirvana maintains Nirvana remains the purest concept after many Its sound, whether we understand the meaning peace and tranquility that no other words When hearing the word 'nirvana,' time seems That moment is when you can completely dissolve, of individual existence behind.&quot; Chapter 2: The Buddha's Quest for Truth When the Buddha was born, astrologers warned Your Majesty should know this. The prince who has just been born will either or he will become an ascetic monk. These are the two extremes...' The king was aging when the prince was born, He requested the astrologers to find a way and renouncing the world. These astrologers knew nothing about the mind Perhaps they only knew about the stars far And how foolish humans are to believe that the millions of stars far away! There is a reason for the meaningful existence think that the entire universe cares about Even the stars far away are striving to do are not nothing.&quot; &quot;The stars far away don't even know about feels stroked. Astrologers have exploited this since the Of course, they exploit you, you have to pay give you a big ego. You become grand, more important than the They all revolve around you! But these poor astrologers are not even as They told the king, 'If Your Majesty wants gods need to perform some rituals.' In India, there are three distinct seasons Nowadays, this has changed; but before, every and also on a similar day, the rain would In the winter, it arrives on the same day Throughout the centuries, the seasons unfolded Nowadays, it has changed, but in the time The king father had three palaces built, each In the summer, the palace on the hilltop was Every detail was meticulously arranged so with this world. In the winter, a warm atmosphere enveloped The astrologers told the king: 'From the outset, so that by the time he becomes a young man, of the country.' They went even further into detail, saying for seeing the elderly would make the prince Never let the prince see the dead. Absolutely do not let the prince know about idyllic fairyland. Their argument was that when one has everything, it? The prince was cared for by the country's Even the gardeners in the palace were ordered to wilt or a leaf about to change color. When night fell, anything signaling death The prince only saw beautiful, vibrant flowers. He only saw evergreen leaves. And the king could do this. The king ordered it to be done, and this method Those foolish astrologers did not realize does not recognize the ugliness around, sooner Sooner or later, he will start to think, 'Is Then tomorrow will be the same, the day after What's the point?' He will become bored. And that's what happened. The prince became bored with the ever-beautiful How long can your mind stay silent? It was the astrologers who caused the prince If he had been allowed to live a normal life been no Buddha. To some extent, the astrologers unintentionally Unable to Conceal the Truth Every year, the palace holds a festival, and presides over and declares the opening of The festival lasts for several weeks with performances. At the age of twenty-nine, Crown Prince Siddhartha On the way to the festival, every detail was finds its way to reach you. You cannot remain completely closed like a If you are alive, there will surely be air aware of reality. Astrologers and kings cannot be smarter than Every detail was meticulously arranged along venue, no elderly, no dead bodies, no funeral prince suspicious. But you cannot avoid reality for long. As the carriage was heading towards the festival, He was deaf and did not hear the prohibition and not go out. The old man was deaf, unable to hear, so out to the market to buy food. For the first time in twenty-nine years, the the threshold of death. The prince asked the coachman: - What is happening? What has happened to that man? I have never seen anything like this! The coachman loved the prince like his own He couldn't lie. - Although this will go against the king's Everyone tried everything so that the prince Everyone has to grow old. The deity will also grow old. This is the law of life. The prince then asked: - Does that mean one day I will also grow The coachman replied: - I beg the deity to be truthful. I hope this will not happen to the prince, change it. Just as the prince grew from a child to a man. And then someone died right there. Now you cannot prevent death. You cannot command death in a way like &quot;You may happen elsewhere.&quot; Death is not within your control. Someone dies, people cry, and the dead body The prince asked: - What happened? Why is everyone crying? Crown Prince Siddhartha had never seen anyone seen a dead body. He asked: - What happened to this person? He isn't even breathing anymore! The coachman said: - This is the next stage. First, the prince sees the old man. Before long, death will come. And it has come for him. The prince asked: - So will I also die someday? The coachman, though fearful of the king, - The truth is the truth, and no one can deny Your Majesty will die, I will die, the prince Death begins on the day people are born. After being born, there is no escape from &quot;And at that moment, they passed by a wanderer, The astrologers had warned the king: 'The for they are against everything. They teach that this world is an illusion, are only wasting their lives, and every passing We must avoid the wanderers.' And for twenty-nine years, Crown Prince Siddhartha beyond life and death. The wanderer in the red-orange robe looked a wanderer in twenty-nine years, must have He asked: - And what about this man? I have seen many people but never anyone dressed Who is he? The coachman replied: - This is someone who understands that beauty old age, that life turns into death, and he eternal. Is there anything untouched by youth, old He is a wanderer; he has renounced the mundane He is seeking the truth. As they approached the festival venue, the - Turn back, I will not attend the festival If youth ultimately turns into old age, sickness, I have wasted twenty-nine years in vain. I have lived in dreams. I am no longer young, and I no longer want Tonight, I will renounce this world and seek What the astrologers told the king seemed is shallow. They could not imagine one simple thing: no a lifetime. It's best to let them know from the beginning, And it happened. That very night, Crown Prince Siddhartha left &quot;Chapter3: The Journey Towards Enlightenment The prince diligently sought truth for six fully as he did. He sought out every master to learn from. There was not a single teacher that the prince He devoted himself completely, absorbing fully that even the teachers themselves began to But in the end, each teacher had to say: &quot;This is all we can teach. And if nothing happens, we cannot blame you We cannot help any further. You will have to seek guidance from someone This rarely happens because disciples never Usually, a teacher would say: &quot;Because you But Crown Prince Siddhartha did so well, so did not do well.&quot; So they had to accept failure. They had to say: &quot;This is all we can teach, so it is best for you to seek another teacher. You do not belong to us.&quot; The prince wandered and learned from various most absurd disciplines. He was taught to fast, so he fasted for months He fasted for six months, only consuming a He became emaciated, like a skeleton. All the flesh vanished from his body, and He became so weak that he could not move.&quot; Being One's Own Master Finally, one day, while bathing in the Niranjana became so weak that he could not swim across He fell down and believed that he was about on the door. He was too feeble to cross. Suddenly, he grasped a branch and leaned on And for the first time, he realized: &quot;If I summer when the water is almost dry, like ocean of the world?&quot; WHAT IS TO BE DONE? How can one transcend this world? It seems impossible. &quot;I am doing something foolish,&quot; he thought. What is to be done? He crossed the river that evening and sat as the Bodhi tree. And that night, when the moon rose, it was were futile. He realized that he had not achieved anything, meaningless. He had done everything. He was done with this world, with the world He would be the king of a kingdom and had He was done with it all, nothing left to do, And for six years, he had practiced every yoga, everything, and nothing happened. Therefore, he said: &quot;Now there is nothing There is nothing to attain anymore, and all desires are just ephemeral.&quot; WHEN EFFORT REACHES NON-EFFORT Therefore, he abandoned all effort that night. He sat under the tree, relaxed, loosened, nothing worthy to strive for. When you are in that state, the mind relaxes, go, so what to do? He simply sat there, like a tree trunk. He slept the whole night through; and in the his life he truly slept, because if there in sleep. Those who earn money and pursue wealth will in their dreams. Those who pursue political power will continue You all know that when participating in a of taking the exam; the image of you sitting over and over. So whatever effort it is, it will continue for something. That night there was no effort. The Buddha said: &quot;I slept for the first time That was the first night I slept.&quot; That sleep became samadhi (meditative absorption). And when he woke up in the morning, the Buddha He truly saw. For the first time, his eyes only emptiness, reflecting nothing. The last star disappears, and the Buddha says: The star disappears and I also disappear&quot; If you make an effort, the self will be nurtured, you are trying to achieve something. So when there is no effort, how can you exist? The last star disappears, &quot;And I also disappear,&quot; then I look inside, there is nothing - anatta, No one at all.&quot; It is said that the Buddha laughed at all No one can reach anywhere. No one can achieve a goal, no one can attain Emptiness is not outside, emptiness is inside. &quot;And in that moment of complete non-effort, But don't go sit under the tree and wait for Don't wait with the thought that when the Those six long years are the precondition So, the point here is: no one achieves anything when striving. When effort reaches a state like non-effort, Chapter 4: The Greatest Offering: Vipassana The Buddha introduced a completely new concept Before the Buddha, meditation was something in the morning, an hour in the evening, and The Buddha brought a whole new understanding He said that the kind of meditation you do evening, or maybe four or five times a day, Meditation cannot be something you separate Meditation must be in harmony with life, it You cannot just breathe for an hour in the you do, the evening will never come. It must be like breathing - even when you You may be unconscious, but you continue to The Buddha said that meditation must be a you. And he introduced a new meditation technique. His greatest offering to the world was Vipassana. Vipassana is a Pali word, the language the a prince, he was taught Sanskrit, the language But when speaking, he never used this kind ascetics, intellectuals, not of the common Sanskrit has never been a language used for It carries a unique quality compared to all by intellectuals, scholars; and because of mystical. If translated, it is nothing special, even It possesses the most perfect structure among But he decided to speak the language of the It was a revolutionary step because the language By being used, by ordinary people changing to use and less complicated. Pali is a simple language, and it is the language Vipassana is their language. The literal meaning of this word is &quot;to see,&quot; to witness.&quot; The Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, chose a type All other types of meditation are witnessing Witnessing is an essential Chapterof all types The Buddha eliminated everything else and JUST OBSERVE AND DO NOT JUDGE There are three steps of witnessing; He started It's easy when you see your hands moving, You can see yourself walking on the road, You can see yourself eating. So, the first step in vipassana - the simplest And when you witness the body's actions, you'll When you witness the movement of your hand grace, charm, and even the tranquility in You can move your hand without witnessing; The Buddha walked very slowly, so slow that The Buddha replied: &quot;This is Chapterof meditation entering a cold stream... very slowly, attentively, because the stream very strong; witnessing each step because OBSERVE THE MIND The method remains the same, only the object The second step is seeing the mind. Now is the time you step into a more subtle If you have seen the actions of your body, Thoughts are subtle waves but they also exist They are not invisible, just as the air is so do your thoughts, they exist and are not That is the second step, the intermediate You are heading towards the invisible, but seeing your thoughts. There is only one condition: do not judge. Do not judge, because the moment judgment There is nothing wrong with judging. The reason it is prohibited is because the thought&quot; - you will not witness anymore. You start thinking, you get involved. You cannot detach, cannot stand on the sidelines Do not become a participant, whether through no attitude towards the things passing through You should see your thoughts as clouds drifting Do not judge them, such as these dark clouds houses. Clouds are clouds, neither good nor bad. Thoughts are the same, just small waves passing Observe without judgment, and you will await When your seeing becomes stable, thoughts If your witnessing is stable at 50%, then If your witnessing is stable at 60%, then When you witness at 99%, only 1% of thoughts like a crowd passing by and then disappearing. Rush hour traffic is no more. When you reach 100%, that is, completely non-judgmental because a mirror never judges. An ugly woman looks into the mirror, the mirror A beautiful woman looks into the mirror, it When no one looks into the mirror, it still Whether reflecting or not, the mirror remains Witnessing will become a mirror. This is the greatest achievement in meditation. You have come halfway, and this is the most Now you know the secret, and this secret must OBSERVE EMOTIONS AND MOODS From thoughts, you must transition to more and moods. From the mind to the heart, with the same And surprisingly, most of your emotions, feelings, At this point, when feeling sad, you become When you feel anger, it is not a partial feeling. You become fully enraged, every cell in your Look into your heart, experience when nothing Sadness comes and goes, you do not become Joy comes and goes, you do not become joyful. Whatever moves into the deeper layers inside For the first time, you taste something of You are no longer a slave subjected to someone When witnessing the third step, for the first you, nothing can overwhelm you, everything at the peak. When you have completely witnessed your body, then you must wait. When these three steps are completed, the It is a quantum leap from the heart to the You must remember, you cannot do that, it Do not try to accomplish it, because the harder It is inevitable. You prepare the three steps, and the fourth quantum leap. Suddenly, your source of life, your witnessing, You have returned home. You may call it self-realization, you may freedom but it is nothing more. You must seek to the utmost, you have found it brings through the veil of illusion surrounding Chapter 5: The Middle Way (Majjhima Nikaya) on a hot summer day, he felt thirsty. Being elderly, he instructed his disciple - Ananda, I apologize, but I must return. We passed by a small stream about two, three Please go back there and fetch some water. Ananda replied: My joy lies in serving you. I have a duty to obey. You sit and rest under the tree while I fetch Ananda turned back. He knew the exact location of the stream because And as they passed, the stream was still clear But when Ananda returned to fetch the water, become murky, with mud stirred up from the Decayed leaves floated on top. Thinking he couldn't bring that water for Ananda returned. - I cannot fetch that water for you, but do Four more miles ahead, I know there is a large you. Although it is already dark, and you are thirsty The Buddha replied: You need not waste time; you should have brought But the water there is dirty and murky, with How can I bring that water for you? The Buddha replied: When the Master insisted, Ananda returned, drifted away. The water kept flowing, carrying everything the water slightly murky. At this moment, Ananda understood the message He sat down beside the stream. That's what the Buddha meant - &quot;Go back,&quot; If Ananda just waited, the water surface would He waited, and before long, the water was He fetched the water and returned. The Buddha asked: Ananda burst into tears. He replied: In fact, I did not tell you this story. As soon as I returned to the stream, I saw the entire stream to become muddy. I jumped into the stream to keep the water But the more I tried, the murkier the water The more I stepped in, the more mud surfaced, Thinking I couldn't do anything, I returned. I did not tell you this. I am sorry. I am so foolish. That was not the way to help the water return In fact, I just needed to sit and wait, just Everything happens in its own way. The leaves float along with the stream, and Just sitting there, looking at the stream, is the stream of the mind - with all its harmful keep trying to clean the water. Jumping in the stream only made things worse in this life, I won't be able to do as you But today, seeing that stream, a great hope will also settle in a similar way. The Buddha said: And I did not ask you to fetch water for me, message. When we arrived at the stream, I saw two carts when they would cross the stream, I asked &quot;Simply sit down beside the stream of your Do nothing; no one expects anything from you. Just sit quietly, as if it doesn't concern What's happening in your mind is also happening The mind is not you; it belongs to someone You are just the observer. The Buddha called his entire philosophy Majjhima He believed in always staying in the middle; the middle. Witness that you always remain in the middle. The moment you stop witnessing, you either If pushed back, you'll follow another extreme; extreme, but you'll never be in the middle. Be the witness. Don't attach, nor be pushed back. Pain will arise, accept it. That's the truth. When the tree is there, the house is there, Accept it and close your eyes. Don't try to escape from it. If you're happy, accept that truth. Don't cling to it, and don't try to become Don't try to do anything. If unhappiness comes, let it come. If happiness comes, allow it to come. Just be the observer standing on the hill, The sunrise comes, then the night falls, the envelops, then the sun rises again - and you're You can't do anything. You simply see. The sunrise comes; you acknowledge that, and sunrise comes the night.&quot; &quot;And when the night falls, you acknowledge again because after the darkness comes the When pain is there, you're just the observer. You know the pain has come, and sooner or And when happiness comes, you know it won't Unhappiness is just lurking somewhere; it You remain the observer. If you can observe without attachment and the middle, and once the pendulum stops in what the real world is like. While moving, you can't know what the world Once there's no more movement, you can see For the first time, you know what reality A still mind knows what reality is; a mind Your mind is like a camera - you keep moving appears becomes unclear because the camera If the camera isn't still, all the pictures Your consciousness keeps swinging from one Therefore, anything you know about reality Nothing leads to anything; everything is topsy-turvy, If you stand in the middle and the pendulum then you'll know what reality is. Only a still mind understands what truth is.&quot; Chapter6: Emptiness (Sunyata) in Buddhist The entire religion of the Buddha can be described That's the core message of the Buddha, the No one else raises freedom to such heights. That's the supreme value in the Buddha's vision, Perhaps it's necessary to understand why the It's not God, it's not the path of meditation, That's because all things of value can only Love also flourishes on the soil of freedom; Without freedom, what you call love is nothing Without freedom, there's no God. Without freedom, the God you think of is just your greed. Without freedom, there's no meditation. Freedom is meditation itself. And if you think there's meditation without it's not real. It's just your illusion, your dream. All the great values in life develop in an most fundamental and highest value. If you want to understand the Buddha, you talking about.&quot; &quot;Freedom doesn't come from the outside. It's not social, political, or economic. It's spiritual freedom. When the Buddha speaks of freedom, he means unrestrained by greed, by wanting more. When the Buddha speaks of freedom, he means It's completely empty because anything contained be absolutely empty. The term &quot;emptiness,&quot; sunyata, has been widely Whenever we hear the term &quot;emptiness,&quot; we In the language of the Buddha, emptiness is more positive than what's called fulfillment while other things have been removed. It's vast, expansive; all boundaries have It's unlimited, and only in the unlimited The emptiness of the Buddha is not ordinary of the invisible. For example, when you clean your room, when from the room, the room becomes empty because but on the other hand, the invisible begins That invisibility is vastness. The room becomes larger. When you remove clutter, the room becomes When everything has been removed, even the That's the whole process of meditation: removing of nothingness, not even you remaining. Within that absolute stillness is freedom. In that absolute stillness will appear the fragrance: the fragrance of peace, of hidden Chapter 7: The Greatness of the Buddha - Compassionate The emphasis on compassionate consciousness is a profoundly new phenomenon for previous The Buddha created a historical milestone. Before him, only meditation was enough; no alongside meditation. The reason is that meditation brings enlightenment, So what more do you need? Considering every human heart, meditation The greatness of the Buddha Shakyamuni encompasses even before you begin meditation. You should love more, be more compassionate, There is a scientific explanation for this. Before a person attains enlightenment, if it's highly likely that after meditation, praise, similar to what they have achieved. The Buddha Shakyamuni made enlightenment a But if one feels they have returned home, For the first time, enlightenment became a into a social responsibility. That's a great change. But humans must learn compassionate consciousness Without learning compassionate consciousness afterward. When humans are too absorbed in themselves, hindrance to their own joy, causing a disruption &quot;That's why there are hundreds of people who masters. You don't necessarily have to become a master Becoming a master means you have a rich compassionate the full beauty of enlightenment alone. You want to help blind people find their way Helping them becomes your joy, not a bother. In fact, you become even more excited when fragrance; you are no longer the only blooming When the whole forest blooms with you, the your enlightenment, you have created a revolution The Buddha Shakyamuni not only attained enlightenment His concern for the world, for humanity, was He taught his disciples that when meditating would begin to spread within you; don't hold world. And don't worry because the more you give, Giving will have tremendous significance when away from you; on the contrary, it will multiply Those who have never known compassionate consciousness will not know the secret of sharing. Once, one of the disciples of Buddha Shakyamuni to Buddha - said: &quot;I will do that... but I want an exception. I will give all my joy, all my meditation, to this world, except for my neighbor because Neighbors are always enemies.&quot; Buddha Shakyamuni said to the disciple: &quot;Forget about the whole world, just give it The disciple asked: &quot;What are you talking about, Master?&quot; The Buddha replied: &quot;Only when you can give it to your neighbor a fellow human being.&quot; The basic meaning of compassion is to accept to behave like saints. That's cruel because others won't be able expectations, and they will lose their self-respect. You make them numb; you have destroyed their One of the most basic things about compassion realize that what happened to you could happen case, that they are not worthless, that enlightenment inherent nature, the inherent identity of However, these words need to come from someone will they make you believe. If spoken by scholars who have not attained The words spoken by an enlightened person It becomes alive, going straight to your heart; But for scholars, it's different. The scholar himself is not sure about what He is uncertain just like you. Buddha Shakyamuni is a turning point in the is great, infinite. And in his contribution, the idea of compassion But remember that having compassion does not will miss its entire meaning. It will become a journey of the ego. Remember not to embarrass someone by pitying pity from you is the humiliation of others. &quot;Compassion must be understood because it &quot;Anyone, Compassion is not a relationship; You like to express love for trees, for birds, anything in return. Let me tell you an interesting story: Paddy came home earlier than usual and found When asked why, the beautiful wife said: - I'm protesting because I don't have nice Paddy opened the wardrobe, looked inside, - That's absurd. There are yellow dresses, red dresses, floral Hello Bill, there's a green dress... This is compassion! This is compassion towards the wife, compassion No jealousy, no argument, just a simple &quot;Hello The husband didn't even bother to ask, &quot;What Compassion is the expression of someone who It is the most delicate understanding of a At an intersection, a man's car veered off with the words &quot;Just Married&quot;. It was just a minor collision, but the man &quot;Oh, it's okay. Just bad luck,&quot; the groom replied.&quot; &quot;COMPASSION IS UNDERSTANDING THAT ANYTHING Once married, he is capable of accepting all The biggest accident has already happened, Those with compassion will not be affected can happen at any time. Only then, indirectly, will your compassionate stronger and continue to flourish with meditation. Therefore, in the moment when blessings come, be at least one companion: compassion. And immediately, you will experience a new to wish the world well.&quot; &quot;CONCLUSION: BE THE LIGHT THAT ILLUMINATES The final words of Buddha Thich Ca Mau Ni Don't follow others, don't imitate others, foolishness. You are born with boundless understanding. You are born with light within. Listen to the small voice, the silence within, No one can lead you, no one can be a model Before, no one was exactly like you, and the This is your brilliance, your greatness, that not anyone else. Those who imitate others will become impostors, They may become saints in the eyes of others, else. They may be very respectable characters but what's inside. Just scratch them lightly, and you will be completely opposite to the outside. By following others, you may create a beautiful and without a beautiful mind, you will never You will lose everything that is real, lose You will be artificial, not natural; and artificial, the foolish.&quot; &quot;According to Buddha, enlightenment is living while ignorance is following others, imitating A genuine teacher will create real disciples, A true teacher will throw you back to yourself. Their entire effort is to make you no longer relying for centuries, and it hasn't gotten You will continue to stumble in the darkness Only the inner light can become the sunrise. A false teacher will persuade you to follow A true teacher will not allow you to be a They love you! How can they make you a copy? They have compassion for you, wanting you dependencies. But ordinary people don't want freedom. They want dependency. They want someone to lead them. Why is that? Because then they can unload all responsibility And the more responsibility they unload onto wise. It is the responsibility, the challenge of You have to accept life with all its challenges.
