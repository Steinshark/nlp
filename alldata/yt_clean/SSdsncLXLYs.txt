&quot;What will happen over the course of &quot;Max Verstappen is the champion of the world!!!&quot; You've been hearing about F1 too, right? Cool. Let's talk about it. &quot;Formula 1 racing...&quot; &quot;into Miami for the first time...&quot; &quot;the hottest ticket in town...&quot; &quot;hooked on Drive to Survive&quot; &quot;Drive to Survive...&quot; &quot;Drive to Survive!&quot; This is a car race at over 200 miles an hour... in cities all over the world.... &quot;Miami Grand Prix!&quot; &quot;Bahrain Grand Prix!&quot; &quot;Here in Monaco...&quot; with insanely famous drivers... &quot;Daniel Riccardo!&quot; &quot;Lewis Hamilton, seven-time world champion....&quot; and hundred-person teams... racing cars so advanced that they're ... and so expensive that they had teams couldn't spend more than EACH. And it's only getting bigger. Just look at this: This is from a construction This one's in Miami. This cost $40 million dollars to build and it hosted That's a Super Bowl-worth of people And one of them was me... &quot;It's the first ever Miami Grand Prix, &quot;and it's lights out and away we go!&quot; &quot;This is the coolest thing I have ever... I just love F1. But a lot of people, because of all this hype and they're feeling a little bit... [confused noise?] &quot;I don't understand!&quot; So let's get into it. This is "F1, explained for rookies." What you need to know to keep up with that everyone's suddenly obsessed with. &quot;Lewis Hamilton!&quot; &quot;Verstappen...&quot; &quot;He's done!&quot; But it's also a look at the bigger question Why do this? Why pour so much money, The answer is in what we get in return. This isn't just a car race. This is a space program, for the road. &quot;General growth in interest...&quot; &quot;in Formula 1...&quot; &quot;F1 is becoming much more of a thing &quot;The Monaco Grand Prix!&quot; &quot;The Italian Grand Prix!&quot; &quot;Wins the Bahrain Grand Prix!&quot; If you're new to F1, you might know its NASCAR has the least family resemblance. IndyCar and F1 look more related. They've got the But there's one really important difference And it's the reason F1 specifically is such In IndyCar, all the cars use the same frame So the competition here is mostly in how you But in F1, every team has to design And the best part is that they get to Or... not, depending on how they do. So the competition in F1 actually Not just how you race it, but also how you build This is why I love F1. It looks like the sport of daredevils - but Each team races two cars. So, two different drivers for the same team. Each event - or "Grand Prix" - is three I watch the races on tv every time they're on. But this was the first time I ever &quot;I got to see the car up close!! That was awesome.&quot; &quot;Now I am inside the Mercedes garage... !!!&quot; Truly, I've never had MORE fun at a and seen less of what was actually going on. &quot;So right now they're about to do a practice pit...&quot; Here's how this works: The order of who the lineup at the starting line on race day. Passing isn't easy, so where you start is Depending on where drivers finish, they get (After 10th place, no points for you.) "NO SOUP FOR YOU!" The drivers' want to get the most points But the teams want to get the most points The two-championship thing makes for funny You can hear it on the radio when teams have pass each other, and drivers get really &quot;If he's quicker, you let him through.&quot; &quot;That's very unfair. But ok.&quot; But generally, everybody agrees Drivers, race your fastest. Teams, make the best car. Alright... here's the fun part! &quot;LEGO is here! Hey, kids, look!&quot; &quot;Here's my driver, hello Lewis Hamilton&quot; Think of an F1 car like an airplane upside Both built to move as quickly through the But where a plane's wings work to lift it Why? Because winning doesn't just depend on going And that requires a firm grip on the ground. Take a look at the shape of this car. Now watch how air moves across it... See how some goes above the wing, This creates a situation where there's sucking the car toward the ground. That's actually happening all over the car, We could talk for hours about the design Some pull air in through the car to cool it down... You can actually see, there's a hole there... I think they're trying to imply that on Some actually let the driver release air - lessening them to go faster in order to pass, You can actually hear this in a race. &quot;Charles Leclerc is going to have DRS Taken together, an F1 car is just a I got to see them up close and personal &quot;We're going there!&quot; I ABSOLUTELY did not keep my cool. &quot;I'm trying to be cool, but it's a real scene here!&quot; You can see teams perfecting these cars over and adding them, changing the shape, pushing off just fractions of a second. Hundreds, sometimes thousands of people work So um... how much does this COST? F1 teams don't really want to share the details here, But they're also companies, and some So, with a little bit of research into various Hold on! Dun-dun-na-nah! Here they are. Annual reports for every F1 team I could find. Which is actually 8 out of 10, so I'm &quot;That's pretty good...&quot; As a fan, this is kind of cool. Like, look this is Toto Wolff's signature... What I learned from all this is that running an F1 team 95 million to 425 million dollars. &quot;Oo that's a lot of money&quot; But the year after these were filed, F1 instituted only be allowed to spend $140 million dollars. So these reports are going to look a lot &quot;Oh good!&quot; Still a lot. No matter what, F1 teams spend So... what do they make? These reports show F1 teams make... approximately... nothing. They run surprisingly close to break even. Red Bull, for example, made 230 million in And they ended up with approximately This is in pounds, so that's about These aren't the wildly profitable enterprises So, why do they do it? Well, take a look at this: This is the Ferrari annual report. "Our brand image depends in part on the the racing team is a key component of It's advertising. &quot;Advertising! Advertising...&quot; They use F1 to sell other stuff, whether that's &quot;Red Bull gives you wings!&quot; I mean, as entertainment, F1 is INCREDIBLE. But a lot of people do feel that it's somewhat... &quot;How much does a Formula 1 car cost?&quot; &quot;$400 million!&quot; &quot;Is it worth all that money?&quot; This is bigger than F1. It's kind of crazy to think about how much But I think what makes F1 feel particularly All this engineering work and all of this energy being makes people wonder sometimes if that energy &quot;Like literally anywhere else.&quot; But F1 is more than just entertainment. It's better thought of actually as F1 pushes everything to the extreme. What do you need to create to compete at this to keep the driver safe in these conditions? The idea is that the technology they build ends My question was: Is this actually true, or I wanted to find examples of specific car ended up in my car. But the more research I did, the more People often talk about paddle shifters, for example... but those were actually developed decades before F1. F1 teams just made them better. Same for active suspension, anti-lock brakes, What I found was that F1 was less "trickle-down" F1 combines technologies that might already making them better in the process and then better tech for all of us. For example, take "thermal efficiency". The percentage of the energy from combustion to being lost as heat. Most combustion road cars have a thermal efficiency Which means only a third of the energy F1 cars can't refuel during a race, so there's They're at about 50% now, thanks to new the rest of the car industry forward. Or, data collection. Sensors on F1 cars collect HUGE amounts of driver and the team. They didn't invent a lot of these systems, in ways that they've never been used before. And that's getting more and more important, This is the real promise of F1, and it all build their own cars. Basically: "We'll do all this research and development, combine all of the cutting-edge tech, and and you don't even need to pay for it! We'll race these things against other groups of in this crazy, 'round the world sport that that is actually at the end of the day group project science competition of all time. People debate whether or not we should spend money they consistently push forward both the tech our understanding of the world around us. In this case, it also makes some money and I think once you see the promise of F1, think differently about lots of things. We need people working far beyond the edge, The question now is: If F1 pushes forward car innovation... and does F1 need to get more electric too? And if F1 doesn't go more electric, does it get Less applicable to the technology we use, "oh, let's go watch the cars that use GAS!" I don't know. Now you're up to speed. You can watch a race, you can enjoy it with your friends, and you can also speculate, like the rest of us, where it's all going to go. I'll be watching with you. And I'll be rooting for my favorite team.
