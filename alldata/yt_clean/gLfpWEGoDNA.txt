So when I first decided to do The Chosen and this show about Jesus, it was always under the idea that this was gonna be different. From the beginning was imagining doing this show - It was a very slow dance to get into. Like, &quot;So I'm doing this show and &quot;it's about Jesus, but &quot;it's actually a very human story &quot;about the people around Jesus &quot;and the way that He affected them &quot;and the way that they affected Him &quot;and the way their stories and at that point I felt like, &quot;All right, this is worth, &quot;this is worth entertaining.&quot; And I've always trusted Dallas. - And I got a text message from Dan and it said, &quot;Hey, what are you doing &quot;the next couple months? &quot;I might have a TV scoring And I thought this is, literally nothing more perfect could happen to me right now timing-wise. And doing this kind of work, writing music to picture is something that has - Most stories about Jesus are these, you know, they have these incredibly dramatic sentimental There isn't an emotional moment that is left untouched by the music. Everything is sort of handed And I think when Dallas and I were talking we really wanted to create something that gave the audience that they would find some and that our musical palette - He's usually trying to push and I was like, &quot;That's &quot;and I want you to have complete freedom, &quot;there's no rules on this.&quot; - And we felt like what if we could tell, take what we knew of Middle Eastern music and what other tones And we thought, &quot;Well, there's &quot;and the way that you can add &quot;certain elements of blues &quot;that it all kind of works together. &quot;And then let's just add in &quot;what is kind of maybe our &quot;of music that has come Spirituals and things that during the heighth of slavery in America, and we thought, &quot;Well, &quot;if we could combine those three textures &quot;as the core of what we made for music, &quot;I feel like we can create &quot;a very human sounding - This show is gonna be about kind of that mix of pain and hope. And that's one of the things was this immense suffering but this also dignified and this belief that and that there was going to be rescue. That's something that I think was also taking place 2,000 years ago was this immense and pain and suffering, but there was also this beauty and hope that was emerging from it. And so I wanted us to - And what we landed on was this, just this great combination of noises. - Whatever instrument it's got some drift and it's got, and music lovers out will probably notice this is I don't know if they're or if this is a live player, but it's not perfectly in tune, which is part of the reason (brooding cinematic music) And then we've got a drone which comes from India and it's essentially just one note, one note that keeps going and (droning cinematic music) That drone, I think for us, is a bit of a spiritual metaphor for God and that there's this sound that no matter what's that sort of undergirds everything. And we've got some various there's some guitar and there's a, there's an octave mandolin. And then we've got various other bits and that we use to keep the This is an opportunity that are the bumpiest places where things are a little bit out of tune, where things are not perfectly in time, where the sounds are a little bit raw and I think it brings out those elements in the presentation of the story. - This is what sets the tone for the show. Because we were trying to do something that wasn't just the typical Jesus show, we had to create a theme song - Right off the bat, we wanted the audience to go, &quot;Huh, this isn't my &quot;This is actually something that, &quot;even though it's timeless &quot;and even though it's set 2,000 years ago, &quot;but it still feels current. &quot;It still feels fresh.&quot; - We wanted to use a lot of the elements that we were gonna use and use 'em a little bit differently. And so we knew we were that had a bit of this stompy It would have some of that gritty blues But we weren't really sure what it would end up but we just knew we wanted something that was gonna carry all those elements. What I love is that the In a time when we're very divisive or people are building up walls that at the core of Christianity, the lyric &quot;Ain't no trouble &quot;jump in the water&quot;, like all of these, the whole point was to &quot;You are fully embraced.&quot; And to be able to kick off the show with that sentiment every time. In a way, to me, it felt like, &quot;Oh, this is gonna root Got no trouble with You walk on the water Ooh It's been great to see how that song, however startling and starting out the show, is so connected and woven into You walk on the water Got no trouble, ooh Walk - So at the end of episode four, it's the climax of all four episodes. It's the moment of release, And so I assumed, because that the music was going to end up being full and big and important. - For some reason in my mind I kept coming back to this idea of rhythm and just wanting it to feel like it's a party. I wanted it to have a and I wanted it to just and it was sort of like the announcement, like, &quot;Okay, this guy Jesus is, &quot;like, &quot;He's pretty legit, &quot;He's doing some things - Dan said, &quot;I got an &quot;It's gonna be in this, &quot;I mean, almost in this &quot;Irish jig sort of rhythm &quot;and we're gonna go in this &quot;that's more playful and fun.&quot; - And I would sort of like while I'm trying to describe it to him. Dun, da da dun, da da dun, da da da. - And I thought, &quot;All (upbeat Irish music) - When it was sent to me, I was watching on my laptop. At first it started, and &quot;What, no, no, no. &quot;This isn't what I was envisioning.&quot; And then within like &quot;Oh wait a second.&quot; And I started moving, and I'm like, I found myself And my fists were pumping and I was like, &quot;Yes, oh my goodness, oh my goodness!&quot; Before I was even done I paused it and started texting Dan and Matt and I was saying, &quot;I &quot;but it's awesome. &quot;I am cheering and laughing&quot;, I actually was laughing, too. I was like, &quot;Oh my gosh, And so that's one of those moments where the audience really And that when people say to me, &quot;In this scene I felt so much joy &quot;I couldn't even explain it.&quot; And I think that's the It's this unexplainable What Dan and Matt have done is bring you to that place that's not just an emotional place but it's also a spiritual place. I am so proud of this show because it's so much better than I am. And what Matt and Dan is taking the show to a level way beyond that I envisioned, and that's a really cool place to be. When you're seeing something that's even better than it actually makes you feel really safe. And I feel really safe 'cause I know that I'm that are way smarter than I am.
