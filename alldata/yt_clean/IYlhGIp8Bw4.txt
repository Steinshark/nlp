You were right next to the crime scene. Ah no no. It couldn't have been me. I was on the other side of the airship when it happened. Could have been a self report. Yeahhhh. Yeah. Woah!!

You know what, I'll take it. I'm glad to see you too. Why aren't you in red? where what?! Alright. Judah was in the office and I and I noted that he was alone and an easy target So I took my vitals out to see if he was tossed and I noticed that he was thrown out. So I went back and I saw Elijah in the That is right next to the room that Judah was in! Yeah I only understood about six of It's Elijah. Woah guys come on. That's not real evidence. I was nowhere near that she's obviously lying. This is taking forever. I am falling asleep. Come on guys it's gotta be Shiloh. She's pointing fingers which-- You are not actually asleep. Those are fake snores. It is real snores. Okay it's obviously Elijah! Can we please vote him out? If the meeting is over, yes. I was doing such a good job too. Elijah was... AN imposter!! Remember everybody! There's still one imposter left! Right. Right yeah. This day could not possibly get any worse. We had airplane snacks but we ate them all. And it just got worse. Can I press it?
