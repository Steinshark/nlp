Hello friends. How's your week been so far? This weekend we decided to go out with hIro. We stopped by our favorite cafe to warm up with a cozy cup of coffee. Hiro had his first cafe experience today, and he did so well. He was a little nervous with all the new sounds and sights, but he stayed calm and behaved wonderfully The city feels magical in Autumn, leaves falling gently and people wrapped in scarves and jackets, enjoying the crisp air and cozy vibe of the season. Even though it's still autumn, Christmas is already making an appearance in the city The shops are filled with twinkling lights, festive wreaths, and cozy holiday scents. Just seeing these decorations makes me excited for the winter season ahead Mornings are getting colder and darker here in Finland and there's a gentle crispness in the air that just makes everything feel extra cozy. My husband is starting the day with a cozy breakfast of warm rice porridge and freshly brewed coffee. The smell of the coffee and the warm porridge filling the kitchen is just perfect for a slow morning like this. It's a simple breakfast but so nourishing , perfect for these autumn mornings. While Hiro is happily occupied with his treat and toys, I take the chance to do a quick tidy-up around the apartment. It's amazing how a little tidying here and there can make the whole space feel fresher and more inviting especially with a playful pup in the house. The balcony also got a bit of love today I picked up some new autumn plants to add a little life and warmth to the outdoor space. I picked up a lovely new candle from Rituals, which has the cosiest scent. New books arrived today One is The Beauty of Everyday Things by Soetsu Yanagi, a book that celebrates the quiet beauty found in simple, everyday objects The other is Love for Imperfect Things by Haemin Sunim, which explores how we can find peace and acceptance in embracing ourselves just as we are. I'm excited to dive into this one, as it's a reflection on the simple , often overlooked objects in our daily lives. Let's start by making a cup of coffee. The rest of the morning was pure bliss--curled up with a good book, a second cup of coffee, and Hiro, my little reading buddy, cozy by my side. The rest of the day was slow and simple, just the way I like it. For our afternoon coffee, let's enjoy something special, a Finnish classic korvapuusti, which are delicious cinnamon buns. They're a little different from other cinnamon rolls, with hints of cardamom in the dough, which adds such a warm, unique flavor. I love taking a slow moment like this, just enjoying the aroma of fresh coffee and the coziness of a warm pastry. It's a simple pleasure, but it makes the afternoon feel so special In November, the days grow much shorter, and the sun sets as early as 3:50 in the afternoon It's always a bit of a shock, especially when you're used to longer days, but it's part of the rhythm of the season here Tonight's dinner is beef soup. In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil and add the beef chunks and brown them on all sides add the chopped onion and garlic to the pot. Saute for 2-3 minutes until softened. Pour in the beef broth (or water and bouillon cubes or powder ) and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer. Let the soup simmer for about 1.5-2 hours, or until the beef is tender and skim off any foam that rises to the top. add potatoes and tomatoes add fish sauce salt and pepper to taste add cabbage and bokchoy add miso paste Once the soup is ready, taste it and adjust the seasoning if needed. Serve with warm bread or rice for a cozy, comforting meal. It's hearty and warm, just what we need on a chilly autumn night. After dinner, I like to wind down with a hot cup of tea and a little something sweet. Today, I've brought out Fazer's Christmas chocolates, a seasonal favorite here in Finland. I'm really enjoying the quiet pace of these days, savoring the calm before the busyness of the coming months begins. Next month is full of special events--my sister is visiting, we're having a family pre-Christmas party, our wedding anniversary, Christmas, and then moving to a new home before the New Year. These slow days are truly appreciated First snow arrived today. Winter is almost here, and I'm preparing for the long, dark, cold months ahead. Since the first snow is here, it only feels right to set up our Christmas tree As soon as autumn transitions to winter, the days grow shorter and darker, with clouds covering the skies most days and very little sunlight breaking through. I prefer to keep things simple and minimal, focusing on creating a cozy, calming atmosphere. I've added some warm, twinkling lights that bring a soft glow to the room, along with a few ornaments that I love There are also a couple of personal pieces we've collected over the years The tree adds a special touch to these early winter days It's more than just decoration it helps make the darker months feel a bit brighter and more magical. Let's make something warm and delicious I'm making cinnamon rolls. Autumn isn't complete without making cinnamon rolls. My recipe is the same as before, and I'll write it down in the description box for anyone who wants to try it at home. Growing up in the Philippines, I never really experienced the full range of seasons. The weather was either hot or rainy There was a certain simplicity to it, but it also meant I missed out on the rich, varied rhythms that each season brings. Autumn and winter here are so different, and I've come to love how each one has its own unique vibe. In Finland, the seasons aren't just about weather changes, they influence the way people live and what we focus on. Autumn and winter especially seem to invite a slower, more reflective pace. The season feels like a time to settle in, enjoy hot drinks, bake and cook comfort food curl up with a good book by the window, and create a warm, inviting atmosphere at home. Living in Finland, I see how much the changing seasons influence everything from our activities to our moods. They shape the way we live and how we choose to spend our time. It's both grounding and comforting to experience these shifts, knowing that each season brings its own rhythm and beauty and I've learned to appreciate them all in their own way. Thank you so much for spending this cozy days with me. I hope it brought a little warmth and inspiration for the season.
