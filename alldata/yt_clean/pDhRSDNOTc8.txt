[music] Immerse yourself in a world of comfort and aesthetics with a sofa from Boca Room. A blend of unique design and modern technology. Boca Room - the new standard for upholstered furniture in Russia. Hello, friends. Imagine you are Napoleon Bonaparte. You have just landed in Egypt with your army. You have a long list of important tasks ahead. First, you need to take Egypt from the English, then build your political career, become emperor, and conquer Europe. You feel like you're at the center of events, riding the wave of history. At this moment, no one is more significant than you. Perhaps only Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great could compare. And now your army, composed half of barefoot French peasants, approaches Cairo. Near a dusty village called Giza, they see the Egyptian pyramids for the first time. Suddenly, everything you were thinking and worrying about seems small and insignificant. These pyramids were built back when your French ancestors wore animal skins, lived in forests, and prayed to who knows what - probably some oak trees. The pyramids have stood for 4,000 years and will likely stand for as many more. They have witnessed Caesar, Alexander the Great, and countless other kings and generals, each considering themselves the main character of human history. Well, those kings and generals have long turned to dust and, with few exceptions, are completely forgotten. But the pyramids remain. Napoleon was awestruck. He was so impressed by the sight that he began his speech before the battle with the words: &quot;Soldiers, forty centuries of history look down upon you.&quot; If we assume that the pyramids could actually look at anything, they wouldn't have cared at all at that moment. Have they not seen battles over 4,000 years? So, friends, we begin a new history lesson. Today, we'll talk about the pyramids: where they came from, their significance, their construction, and the many wild conspiracy theories that surround them. Let's begin. [music] Now let's imagine it's around 1,000 years before Napoleon. You are a powerful Arab Caliph, a local ruler. From your fortress in the center of Cairo, it's impossible not to notice the pyramids. They catch your eye every day and, frankly, annoy you. So, you decide to open the largest of them - the Great Pyramid of Khufu. Surely, there must be unimaginable treasures there: gold, silver, and gemstones the size of a human head. You've read in ancient books that during Roman times, there was an entrance on the northern side that could be opened. So, following the Caliph's orders, a whole horde of workers labors on the pyramid for several months, day in and day out. They try using hammers and sledgehammers. They even pour vinegar over the casing stones to erode the rock. Finally, from the sound of falling stones inside, the workers realize they've missed their mark by about five meters to the side and ten meters in height. Eventually, your tunnel reaches the correct corridor. But those original pyramid builders, who have been dead for thousands of years, had anticipated this. Inside, the Arabs find no treasure - just a thick layer of dust. That night, the vizier discreetly places a jug of gold coins inside the pyramid, just enough to pay the workers, as it would be awkward otherwise. People had spent months on what seemed like a pointless task. Five hundred years later, one of the Arab Caliph's descendants decides to put this structure to some practical use. He strips the Great Pyramid of Khufu of its white casing stones and uses the harvested blocks to build one of the most beautiful mosques in Cairo. And through the tunnel breached by the Caliph, tourists now enter the pyramid. That opening still exists today. Perhaps if you've visited Giza on a tour, you, too, entered the pyramid through that very hole. [music] It's hard to imagine modern life without something as essential as a bank card.

[music] The pyramids astonished the ancient Greeks, who already saw them as relics from an incomprehensibly distant past. It was unclear when they had been built. The earliest written accounts we have about the pyramids come from Herodotus, the father of history, who lived in the 5th century BCE. However, the Great Pyramid of Khufu was constructed, according to experts, at least as early as the 27th century BCE. This means there was a 22-century gap between Herodotus and the pyramids, which is slightly less &quot;than the time separating us from Herodotus himself. to marvel at the pyramids, much like we now visit the Acropolis and the Colosseum. They pondered the same questions that intrigue us today: What are these structures? Who built them and how? Why were they built? What's inside? Like us, they had no one to ask. The pharaohs had long disappeared, Egypt had been conquered by the Persians, and over thousands of years, the Egyptians had forgotten much of their history. The few remaining priests, for understandable reasons, were not eager to share their secrets with tourists. The Great Pyramid of Khufu was listed among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and is the only one of those wonders still standing today. Let's first examine the most widely accepted theory. Herodotus is the originator of this version, as there are no earlier sources available. He reported that the Egyptians were the most religious and devout people he had ever encountered - a society obsessed with religion and the afterlife. According to Herodotus, the pyramids were the burial places of pharaohs. However, he did note that Khufu himself was not buried inside his own pyramid, fearing that the slaves who built it might seek posthumous revenge and desecrate his body. Indeed, unlike in the tombs of the Valley of the Kings, mummies are rarely found inside the pyramids, and when they are, they are typically fragments. The notion that the pyramids were built by slaves also comes from Herodotus. This idea persisted in historical scholarship for a long time. The ancient Greeks, being slave-owners and traders themselves, found it hard to imagine that such monumental structures could be built by free people willingly hauling stone blocks on their backs across the desert. Today, this version is no longer the primary one. According to current research, the pyramids were built by specialized teams of skilled laborers who were well-compensated for their work. As for the burial function, it is likely true or at least plausible. Around the pyramids, researchers have discovered many items associated with death - nearby temple complexes where funerary rites were performed and, at times, funerary texts inscribed on the interior walls of the pyramids, listing the accomplishments of the deceased. Still, for the people of antiquity, it was as hard to grasp as it is for me today. Spending 20 years building a tomb for one person - no matter if he's a pharaoh - and dedicating the entire economy to this construction? How is that even possible? And by the way, the pharaoh was alive and well during the construction, eagerly awaiting its completion. He would give the architect valuable instructions, saying, "Make it taller; I don't want my tomb to be smaller than, say, my father's. My descendants would laugh at me." The architect isn't just digging a big hole or piling up a massive mound with an obelisk on top. No, he's solving a complex engineering problem. So complex, in fact, that even with all our modern science and technology, it remains a remarkable feat. In this episode, I'll take on the role of an outside observer, which is what I am in many respects. Of course, there is human history, historical documents, and when those documents are lacking, there are earlier chronicles and accounts. By comparing all these sources, and using methods like radiocarbon dating and mathematical models, scientists hypothesize that it happened this way. But as an observer, as a viewer, I find myself perplexed at many points. Just consider: the ancient Egyptians didn't have diesel engines, tower cranes - just hammers, chisels, ropes, drills, and stones. They used stones to polish other stones. Here's a small challenge for you: try taking a large stone, say, a medium-sized one you have at your summer house in the countryside, and try polishing it with another stone. Ask 25 of your friends to join you and dedicate some time to this. Then, record how long it takes you to polish one side to the smoothness of a book cover. How many days, or perhaps weeks, would it take? I haven't conducted such experiments myself, but I can imagine. Today's polishing machines are equipped with all sorts of diamond abrasives and other enhancements, making the process much different. But when you're grinding stone against stone by hand, I can only wonder how long that would take. This is another question from an amateur, and I'll continue to ask them periodically. Now, let's return to the Great Pyramid of Khufu. We will keep coming back to it because, firstly, it is the largest, secondly, the most impressive, and, in general, the most representative. Its official name, translated from ancient Egyptian, is &quot;The Horizon of Khufu.&quot; The pyramids had very poetic, grandiose names: The Horizon of Khufu, The Radiance of Sneferu, The Divine Mykerinos, and so on. Cheops is actually a Greek corruption; the pharaoh's real name was Khnum-Khufu. The Great Pyramid of Khufu stands 146 meters tall. Its base covers an area measuring 230 by 230 meters. For thousands of years, it was the largest man-made structure on Earth. The pyramid is built from 1.5 million stone blocks, with an average block weighing 2.5 tons, though some blocks are heavier. For example, the inner burial chamber is constructed from granite blocks, the heaviest of which weighs 30 tons. In total, the construction required 5 million tons of limestone and 8,000 tons of granite. According to the most widely accepted theory, the construction lasted 20 years. Given the number of blocks and the complexity of the work, 20 years is a very short time. I'll add my own perspective here - it's incredibly short. I can't fathom what kind of organization, not just mathematical but logistical, would be necessary. How could hundreds of thousands of people - skilled workers and slaves - move all these millions of blocks? I find it unimaginable even in the 21st century. Yet historians say this is how it was. The Egyptians were so highly organized in terms of logistics and construction that they were able to accomplish such feats. Moving on. The pyramid was perfectly aligned with the cardinal points: north, east, south, and west. It was built by people who had a deep understanding of engineering. For instance, the pyramid has eight sides, not four. Each side is subtly split down the middle and slightly concave for structural stability. Before an incident involving a sultan, the pyramid was covered in white limestone casing stones that made its sides appear flat rather than stepped, as they do now. These stones were polished and fitted so precisely that in some places the gaps between them were less than a millimeter. At the very top was a special capstone known as a pyramidion, a smaller pyramid that was gilded. So, the white limestone shone under the sun, and the gilded capstone glittered at the top. One can only imagine the impression this sight must have made on the Egyptians. Here's another point I noticed. If you look at the masonry of the pyramids in photographs, you'll see that it isn't just uniform bricks of the same size stacked in rows, it isn't identical blocks here, there, and then on top-it isn't like that at all. Some blocks are precisely cut to fit together better - some shorter, some longer. This means that not only was the logistics meticulously planned, but the production was also precisely calculated. You get it, right? This isn't like what an architect would do now when designing a restaurant or renovating an apartment. Today, they plan everything in AutoCAD, calculating that, for example, a bathroom needs exactly 16 and 2/10 tiles. A worker would then cut one tile to fit perfectly and create a seamless pattern. Now imagine that the same level of calculation went into building the pyramids - without computers. How could they visualize and plan it all? I don't understand. [music] Returning to the pyramids, they are still impressive today. Even though we've seen the Burj Khalifa and humans have traveled to space, there's nothing quite like them. Now, imagine what it was like for illiterate ancient Egyptian peasants to see them. You live in a hut made of clay and palm leaves, catching crocodiles for dinner - or being caught by one for its dinner - and on the horizon, this incredible structure shines. No questions remain. It's clear the pharaoh is a living god. You pay taxes, you listen to the priests, no doubt about it. Do you see where my dissonance comes in? The same peasants who worship crocodiles and believe the pharaoh is a living god stand in awe of the pyramid they themselves have spent 20 years building. So, these peasants, living in clay huts, are seen as simpletons, yet at the same time, they're capable of creating such architectural masterpieces. It doesn't quite fit in the mind of Sergey Minaev, a viewer from Moscow. To understand Ancient Egypt, you need to first grasp what it really was. The Nile was the main artery of the region, and anyone who has been to Egypt knows that in this respect, nothing has changed since the time of Khufu. Life revolves around the Nile. A narrow strip stretches along both banks of the river, while the rest is desert. From the perspective of "let's settle here," the Nile was an absolute jackpot in the ancient world. A vast, water-rich river. And what does water mean? It means life and agriculture. Ancient states that emerged around such rivers were more or less similar in structure. They are often called &quot;hydraulic empires,&quot; meaning everything centered around agriculture and water distribution. You settle by the river, dig an irrigation channel, and that's it - nothing more is needed. You could live like that for 1,000 years or even 10,000 years. And that's exactly how the Egyptians lived. Moreover, the Nile reliably flooded every year, and until it was dammed by the Aswan High Dam, the floods brought incredibly fertile silt that enriched the soil. Combine that with a warm climate - Egyptian winter is around 10-15 degrees Celsius - and you could harvest multiple crops a year in the Nile Valley. Egypt was like a giant agricultural complex that fed not only itself but the entire Mediterranean, the entire ancient world as we know it. There were always various political struggles around the export of Egyptian grain. The same was true in Rome, and later in Byzantium. In a society like this, the best situation was for nothing to change. You plant the crops, you harvest them, and that's how generations lived. Of course, there were wars and foreign invasions, but even they didn't change much. Nobody wanted to break something that worked so well. The new ruler was simply declared a god, a pharaoh, and life continued. The entire bureaucracy and administrative system remained as they were. We talked about this in the episode about Cleopatra. When the Romans arrived, they didn't say, "Now you will have a Roman system of governance." The priests told them, "There's no need to explain anything to our people. We'll tell them you're the new pharaoh. The people will understand, the elite will understand. We'll put the golden mask on you. Don't change anything, and everything will keep working. The grain will continue to flow to Rome, and you'll be seen as a living god." And the Romans quickly agreed to this. As a result, for the average Egyptian peasant, nothing changed at all. The conqueror would simply plug into an existing system and start ruling through it. It was like an eternal, cyclical anthill. And the most effective way to govern such a society was, of course, through religion. While merchants, warriors, politicians, and other familiar figures played significant roles in other ancient civilizations, all of Egypt was under the power of the priests. Temple complexes were responsible for both propaganda and the management of the entire state system, including agriculture, education, and the accumulation of knowledge. At the pinnacle of this system was the pharaoh. He was not just an absolute monarch, not just the high priest, but to simplify it, a literal living god - a sacred figure. A living god not in the sense that he was simply adored or feared, although that was certainly part of it. Nor just because he could do whatever he wished to anyone, though that was true as well. It was in the sense that the pharaoh, in the eyes of the people, was responsible for fundamental aspects of life. Without him, the sun would not rise, and the Nile would not flood. This can be understood on a human level. Life completely dependent on the flooding of the Nile was a life in which one had no control. If there was a flood, life continued as usual. If not, it was a disaster - drought, widespread hunger. Religion provided a sense of control, a belief that something depended on human actions. Why was there a drought? Maybe the sacred crocodiles weren't fed properly, or rituals were performed incorrectly. Next time, the crocodiles would be fed properly, and everything would be fine. The priests might have known that it wasn't really about the crocodiles. They were educated, intelligent people with significant management experience. But why trouble the population - peasants who had been working the fields and digging canals for hundreds of generations? They wouldn't have understood anyway. Egyptian religion is a vast topic worthy of its own episode. We won't spend an hour summarizing Egyptian beliefs now, but a few words are necessary for context. Why did they go to such lengths for the pyramids? The Egyptians lived by the cyclical rhythm of the Nile's floods, and their worldview was also cyclical. The river would flood, then recede. Wheat grains were planted in the soil, grew, were harvested, and new seeds were sown. It sounds almost like a mantra. The central figure of the Egyptian pantheon was Osiris, the god of fertility and the afterlife. In the myths, he was killed, dismembered, and thrown into the Nile, only to be resurrected. Therefore, the ancient Egyptians believed in eternal life after death not only for the god Osiris but for themselves as well. The idea is quite straightforward: everything around them was renewed, the cycle of nature was eternal. So, it made sense that humans likely did not die completely either. Of course, there were nuances. One had to live a worthy life; your heart would be weighed on scales, and so on. But the main idea was that for the soul to have a place to return to, the body had to be made into a mummy. The afterlife of some people was believed to depend directly on the condition of their dead body. This is why bodies were hidden in secure tombs to protect mummies from harm. These tombs were filled with everything needed for the afterlife journey. Pharaohs, naturally, were provided with treasures: weapons, chariots, and other riches, as well as entire armies of servants in the form of special figurines. Pyramids or underground tombs with secret chambers and false doors were built for pharaohs to deceive grave robbers when they came to plunder. People of lesser means were wrapped in cloth and sometimes buried directly in the desert sand. They were given a staff and sandals for their journey to the afterlife. It is believed that the desert itself inspired the ancient Egyptians' idea of mummification. Egypt is extremely dry, with almost no rainfall. In the desert, bodies did not decompose; they dried out and maintained their form. But that was just the beginning. The Egyptians soon achieved great advancements in mummification. Special priests, well-versed in anatomy, used specialized tools to remove anything from the body that was not needed and could cause decay. They invented chemical solutions for embalming. There were several options for mummification - essentially an economy, comfort, and business class. People likely tried not to skimp on this, as the quality of the afterlife depended directly on it. The procedure was fine-tuned to the smallest detail. Moreover, it had to be done quickly and with flawless adherence to the necessary rituals - placing specific amulets in the right places, speaking the correct words. From our perspective, funerals are simply a way of paying respects to the deceased. But for an Egyptian, a human life was at stake. And the fact that it was an afterlife did not make it any less significant. [music] You might ask: did they really believe in all this without any proof? Well, how should I put it? Today, there is a trend among the ultra-wealthy for cryonics. People willingly undergo deep freezing, hoping that someday, in the far future, scientists will discover physical immortality. Conspiracy theorists claim that under Denver Airport, there are already entire rows of these freezers holding the bodies of wealthy individuals. There are no guarantees here either. It's much more likely that some mishap in 2136 will cause someone to accidentally press a button and, for instance, cut the power. And that's it - eternal life will melt into a liquid state, and none of these rich people will ever be revived. But this doesn't deter anyone. In essence, mummification in ancient Egypt was their version of cryonics, only based on religious rather than technological principles. An Egyptian spent his entire life thinking about death, but not in a gloomy sense - quite the opposite. He hoped for an eternity after death. From this perspective, the idea of the entire country spending 20 years building a tomb for the pharaoh doesn't seem strange at all. These were truly grand construction projects. Each pyramid was a national endeavor. So, how was the Great Pyramid of Khufu built? First, they spent a long time choosing the location. The site was new; the previous necropolis could no longer accommodate such a large pyramid. They found a relatively flat limestone plateau, which was very fortunate and immediately solved the foundation issue. The building material problem was also resolved, as limestone for the pyramid could be quarried nearby. Everything was planned with incredible precision. The layout was marked directly onto the limestone, with various markers set up. As a result, the deviation in the length between the different sides of the pyramid is no more than 4 cm, and the difference in height is no more than 2 cm. Interestingly, from the errors, archaeologists were able to determine that the builders started working from the east side, as it was constructed with the highest accuracy. The rock was leveled, but a natural elevation was left in the center, around which the pyramid was built. There is a common belief that the pyramids were made of uniform, perfectly shaped stone blocks, but this is not true. The interior was constructed with blocks of various sizes, roughly cut. These were quarried nearby, southeast of the construction site. It is now believed that a ramp led from the quarry directly to the site, which was later dismantled. The work was still challenging. The lower part of the pyramid was made with 3-ton blocks, while the upper part used 1-ton blocks. There was little concern for the aesthetics of the internal masonry; irregularities were even filled with sand during construction. Recent studies have revealed voids within the masonry. Precisely shaped stones were used for the outer layer, laid in rows with slight gaps. Initially, work could be done from the ground level. As the pyramid grew taller, scaffolding and ramps were built around it. After construction, the scaffolding was partially removed, while some parts became part of the pyramid's core. The external masonry consists of 201 layers, though it is believed that about ten of the top layers have been lost. Above this was a layer of smaller stones and mortar, which has been chemically analyzed, revealing, among other things, traces of charcoal. Finally, the casing was applied. This is where the builders put in significant effort. The casing was made of white limestone brought from a quarry on the opposite bank of the Nile, and its source is known today. In 2013, French archaeologists discovered papyri containing the diary of Merer, one of the foremen of the Great Pyramid's construction. This foreman was responsible for transporting the limestone casing. The blocks were first transported by boat and then dragged to the construction site. According to scholars, the blocks were laid in place first and then polished, resulting in the tight fit that we see. But again, this sounds simple. It's important to understand that the only way to polish stone at that time was by laboriously scraping it with another, harder stone. The amount of time this took is hard to fathom. The papyri with the foreman's diary, by the way, were found at the Red Sea, at a site from which Khufu once sent expeditions for copper ore and turquoise. It's also known that the pharaoh specifically searched for suitable sources of red pigment and other natural dyes for the pyramid's construction. This process was far more complicated than simply buying materials wholesale from a single supplier. The most impressive aspect was how the Egyptians used granite. Unlike limestone, granite had to be transported from afar - from Aswan. The Nile helped simplify this process. When you have a waterway, you can theoretically move anything anywhere. Still, transporting multi-ton granite blocks over 900 km was no small feat. Granite was essential for reinforcing the internal rooms, burial chambers, and tunnels; without it, the pyramid's immense weight would have crushed them. The entrance to the pyramid was located 15 meters above ground and was sealed with a stone plug. From there, a tunnel led down to an underground burial chamber, which archaeologists believe was left unfinished and abandoned. This chamber might have been a contingency in case the pharaoh died early, in which case the pyramid would have been completed over his body. The tunnel to the lower chamber splits into two paths. One branch leads upward, into the core of the pyramid, where there is another fork. A horizontal tunnel extended to the so-called "Queen's Chamber," though the term "queen" is speculative. One theory suggests that the chamber may have held a statue of the pharaoh, allowing one of his several souls to reside there. Evidence of grave robbers has been found here, suggesting that someone managed to break in at some point. Above this level is the area known as the Grand Gallery, a long tunnel section with an eight-meter-high vaulted ceiling. Beyond the gallery was the King's Chamber, lined with black granite. Only an empty sarcophagus was found there. The walls were also made of the same granite. The entrance was blocked by three massive granite doors, which had been lowered into place using a complex system of pulleys and counterweights. The ceiling is supported by nine granite beams, each weighing a total of 400 tons. This was a sophisticated engineering solution with a load distribution system. Amusingly, the builders made a calculation error. A crack appeared in one of the ceiling beams on the southern side, which seemingly occurred during construction. Archaeologists found a technical tunnel that was evidently created to allow workers to check if everything was in order. The construction at Giza was immense in scale. Building the pyramid engaged the entire economy of the country, involving the entire population of Egypt to some extent. Some people hauled stones, others supplied materials, some fed and clothed the workers, and others kept track of accounts and documentation. It's interesting to wonder if anyone managed to skim off the top when it came to supplies - and what would happen to those caught doing so? Entire breweries and hundreds of livestock farms worked to support the construction. Herodotus mentions 100,000 builders, though he likely exaggerated. Besides, he was talking about slaves. Modern research suggests a workforce of several thousand skilled laborers. This included not only builders but also, for instance, workshop workers who made and repaired tools. Of course, neither Herodotus nor modern historians know for certain; they can only make educated guesses. Excavations at the Giza site are ongoing, and what they have found is essentially an entire city. The pharaoh himself sometimes stayed there, living in a temporary palace from which he managed the country. The pyramid was just the centerpiece; surrounding it, a whole temple complex needed to be built, as well as tombs for the royal family and high-ranking officials. This was a posthumous perk of government service - you'd be well taken care of in death, too, with the best professionals in the country handling the job. The architect overseeing all of this even had his own tomb prepared nearby. Of course, the Great Pyramid of Khufu wasn't the only one. Egypt is home to an enormous number of pyramids - at least 118 have been identified so far, and there are likely more. Besides the Great Pyramid, the most famous are the two other pyramids on the Giza Plateau: the Pyramid of Menkaure and the Pyramid of Khafre. Menkaure's pyramid is more modest, standing at only 66 meters tall. However, it features a monolith weighing over 200 tons - a weight that would challenge even modern engineers. Menkaure's pyramid also boasts a distinctive style. In addition to the white limestone, it was clad in red granite. In the 12th century, an Arab sultan, the son of the famous Saladin, ordered the pyramid to be dismantled. Workers spent eight months trying to make a dent in the structure but eventually gave up. The only result of their efforts was a hole in one of the pyramid's sides. They reported to the sultan that, according to their estimates, it would take them longer to tear down the pyramid than it took to build it. Ancient Egyptian builders seemed to work by their own unique standards. The Pyramid of Pharaoh Djoser in Saqqara, built in the 27th century BCE, is considered the oldest in Egypt and has been well preserved. It provides a glimpse into how pyramids evolved over time. Before Djoser, notable Egyptians were buried in one-story tombs known as &quot;mastabas,&quot; which were essentially truncated pyramids with underground burial chambers for mummies. Djoser initially ordered a similar tomb for himself, but the architect decided to experiment and built a stepped structure. The result was well-received - it looked impressive and had symbolic meaning, representing a staircase to the heavens. Interestingly, we even know the name of the architect - Imhotep, the pharaoh's vizier, a wise man, and astrologer. His career was so successful that over a thousand years later, the Egyptians worshiped him as the god of wisdom and medicine. Saqqara is home to not just one pyramid but an entire necropolis, which is fascinating in its own right. For instance, there are pyramids of pharaohs from the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties with &quot;Pyramid Texts&quot; inscribed on the walls of the inner chambers. These texts are the oldest known examples of ancient Egyptian funerary and magical literature, describing rituals, protective spells, and practical advice for navigating the afterlife. The earliest of these texts date back to the 25th and 24th centuries BCE and later formed the foundation for the &quot;Book of the Dead.&quot; [music] Another notable burial complex is Dahshur, located near the ancient city of Memphis, one of Egypt's capitals. It was there that the first pyramid in the familiar smooth-sided shape was built, rather than a stepped one. The Dahshur pyramids also show how the Egyptians experimented. There were originally eleven pyramids, and five have survived. Among them is the famous Black Pyramid, which isn't ominous but rather stands on a hill of black gravel. Its pyramidion, also black, is now kept in the first hall of the Cairo Museum. Another interesting structure is the &quot;Bent Pyramid,&quot; which looks like the work of a perfectionist's nightmare - its wide base leads to a flattened top, almost as if it's two different pyramids stacked together. Scholars have yet to fully understand its logic. One theory is that a design error forced a quick mid-construction change to prevent collapse. Another theory suggests it was rushed because the client died unexpectedly, although this is unlikely since the client was Pharaoh Sneferu, Khufu's father. Sneferu left behind two more pyramids, including the Red Pyramid, the first true pyramid shape and the third tallest after Khufu's and Khafre's, standing at 109.5 meters. Like the Giza pyramids, it once had white casing stones, which were also taken for building materials in the Middle Ages. Beneath the casing, the limestone has a unique tint that appears pink at sunset, giving the pyramid its romantic name. Pyramids were even built outside of Egypt. From the 9th to the 4th century BCE, the Kingdom of Meroe existed in what is now modern-day Sudan. The Nubians, influenced heavily by Egypt, built pyramids of their own. So, modern revisionists who claim that the pharaohs were black have some grounds for their argument. The Nubian Meroites, indeed, emulated their Egyptian counterparts and built pyramids as well. These were small, with the tallest being 30 meters, but there were many of them - 255 in total. Not all have survived, as in the 19th century, the Italian archaeologist Giuseppe Ferlini, who called himself an archaeologist but was more of an adventurer and treasure hunter, came to the region. Tired of digging with a shovel, he resorted to dynamite, blowing up about 40 pyramids in search of treasure. And now we can move on to the theories about aliens. It's interesting that Europe became familiar with the pyramids relatively late. Educated people knew about Ancient Egypt and that some pyramids and ruins remained. But it was the scholars in Napoleon's entourage who brought the first accurate depictions of the pyramids to Europe. There were no indigenous Egyptians left by that time. Their descendants had become the Coptic people, who had largely forgotten their ancient culture. For over a thousand years, Egypt had been home to Arabs, who had no idea what the pyramids were for or why they were built - and most didn't care. Ancient papyri were sometimes burned as fuel, and mummies were dug up, ground into powder, and sold as medicinal supplements, believed to cure any ailment. Napoleon was the first to bring a full-scale scientific expedition to Egypt, resulting in an extensive report. This marked the formal beginning of Egyptology in the 19th century. It was a turbulent time, with esotericism and other forms of mysticism becoming popular. The theme of Egypt was also embraced by the Freemasons, who were influential at the time. On the other hand, scientific traditions were not yet fully established, and many researchers were amateurs or outright charlatans. The idea that historical monuments should be preserved was also not widely accepted, and, as mentioned earlier, dynamite was frequently used. Thus, various occult and esoteric theories began to emerge around the pyramids, and there were so many of them, that they ended up giving rise to a term: "pyramidology." Numerology became a frequent fixation. In 1859, Englishman John Taylor published 'The Great Pyramid: Why Was It Built? And Who Built It?', a book in which he tried to match the proportions of the pyramids to the golden ratio and claimed that the pyramids were built not by the Egyptians but by the Israelites. He even cited passages from the Old Testament to support his theory. Taylor was not a scholar; he was a publisher who earned a living working with minor English poets. He never visited Egypt but set a precedent, becoming the founder of pyramidology. The first to be captivated by Taylor's ideas were members of the British Israelite group, a sect that believed the English were descended from one of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. Their main argument was that the basic Egyptian unit of length, if you looked at it really hard, was approximately equal to the English inch. This idea was opposed by American Charles Taze Russell, who argued that the pyramids were built by God to house the righteous after the Last Judgment. Incidentally, Russell was the founder of the Jehovah's Witnesses, an organization now banned in Russia. There were even more exotic theories. One notable figure was Ignatius Donnelly, an American politician, Freemason, and communist - officially part of an organization called the "Noble and Holy Order of the Knights of Labor." In 1881, he published 'Atlantis: The Antediluvian World', which became wildly popular. In his book, he claimed that Atlantis existed, that its inhabitants were what we call gods, and that ancient Egypt was their last colony. According to him, the Atlanteans, with their unimaginable technologies, built the pyramids - not just in Egypt but around the world. Interest in the pyramids surged again in the second half of the 20th century during the New Age movement, when people were obsessed with the paranormal. In the 1970s, inventor Patrick Flanagan created a model of the Giza pyramids and claimed that pyramids had resonant properties. He gained followers who expanded on his theory, suggesting that people aged more slowly and plants grew faster inside replicas of Egyptian pyramids. And, of course, with the help of sacred pyramid numerology, they predicted World War I, the crucifixion of Christ, and Armageddon. Everything except the latter was predicted retroactively. A 19th-century person saw in the pyramids signs of divine will and keys to interpreting holy texts. Hippies and New Age followers, in line with their time, took the pyramids out of their historical context and credited them to time-traveling aliens. The legendary author of alternative historical theories, Erich von Daniken, attributed the pyramids to ancient astronauts. In 1968, his famous book 'Chariots of the Gods?' was published, in which he was one of the first to outline the theory of paleocontact - the idea that humanity had encountered extraterrestrials in the distant past. According to Daniken, the pyramids were landmarks for these ancient astronauts. He argued that the Egyptians could not have built the pyramids themselves because they lacked the necessary tools. Additionally, he claimed there was no evidence of Egyptian workers at the construction sites. However, in reality, many tools have been found, as well as remains of worker settlements with advanced infrastructure. Despite this, Daniken remains a classic figure in pyramidology and the foundation for many other speculations, including the so-called &quot;Orion Correlation Theory.&quot; This theory posits that the arrangement of the three main pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx corresponds to the stars in the constellations of Orion and Leo. To this day, people with rulers flock to measure the Great Pyramid of Khufu, fascinated by its mathematically significant proportions, precise alignment with the cardinal points, and the mystery that Khufu's body was never found inside. People still say that if you divide certain dimensions of the pyramid by others, you get the number Pi. And if you multiply certain other measurements, you get the golden ratio. You can try it yourself if you want - it's quite entertaining - or watch the documentary 'The Secrets of the Pyramids', where this is laid out convincingly. It's easiest to assume that the ancient Egyptians, like us, had a fascination with proportions and beautiful numbers. The beauty of mathematics and geometry is that they work anywhere - whether in Ancient Egypt or in the Louvre. Any mathematician will tell you that to study math, you need three things: something to write with, something to write on, and preferably a head to think with. The Egyptians had ink, they had papyrus, and they had plenty of time to think - tens of thousands of years. There weren't many other forms of entertainment, no TikTok. Incidentally, fragments of ancient Egyptian mathematical texts have survived. One of them is even kept in Moscow, known as the &quot;Moscow Mathematical Papyrus.&quot; Of course, the idea that the Great Pyramid of Khufu is a multi-ton textbook of basic geometry is quite appealing and very much in line with the spirit of Ancient Egypt. What's curious in all this conspiracy theory is the characteristic belief of modern people that those of the past couldn't possibly have been as intelligent as people today. There's this assumption that some ultra-advanced aliens must have come, built all of it, polished it with laser chisels and atomic hammers, and then left. We live in an age of progress and are used to seeing it as linear. Today you have a steam engine, tomorrow you have a car, and the day after, a spaceship - or maybe the ancient Atlanteans already had one. Anything complex and impressive is automatically associated with futurism and technological advancement. There are actually a million alternative theories about the purpose and origin of the pyramids. The average professional Egyptologist receives about one letter per week on this subject. A cosmic beacon, a giant sundial measuring the time until the end of civilization, with the Sphinx as its hand. A message from the past to the future, where essential knowledge is encoded like on the plaques of the Pioneer spacecraft. What else? The Biblical granary - this was a medieval theory suggested by Christian pilgrims. Facilities for fertilizer production. The headquarters of intelligent dinosaurs who perished in a nuclear war. An alien base. Even an energy plant that operated on unknown principles. There are pyramidologists who insist that the Great Pyramid of Khufu is aligned with the pyramids of the Incas, Easter Island, Angkor Wat, and other similar landmarks. Of course, the Earth is round, and with enough imagination, you can connect anything in a line, depending on how you draw it. Some particularly imaginative people even claim to see an Apache attack helicopter depicted among the hieroglyphs, though why the ancient Egyptians would have modern American helicopters isn't clear. Battle tripods would be more fitting in that context. Egyptologists sometimes jokingly call pyramidologists &quot;pyramidiots,&quot; which, while offensive and often true, isn't always the case. Alternative theories about pyramids - or any topic, really - are not as laughable as they may seem. The main argument against the religious function of the pyramids goes like this: archaeologists often attribute a religious function to anything they don't understand. There have been similar cases in history. For example, in the 19th century, experts were convinced that the ancient Romans had special household shrines where they worshiped running water and river nymphs. But by the end of the 19th century, major European cities switched from cesspits to toilets with flush systems, and then it dawned on these experts that these "shrines" were actually ancient Roman public toilets with sewage systems. It's not out of the question that something similar might happen with the pyramids. Maybe in the 23rd century, humanity will suddenly realize that the pyramids were not tombs. People will smack their foreheads and say, "Oh, so that's what it was!" If convincing enough evidence emerges, mainstream science will not hide it. After all, imagine how many dissertations could be written! But for now, the tomb theory remains the most compelling. New information continues to emerge, and research is ongoing. For example, in 1993, a small robot named after the Egyptian god who opens paths was sent into the air shafts of the Great Pyramid of Khufu. It turned out these were not ventilation shafts; they reached the surface but didn't exit outside. So, what were they for? It's still unclear. The leading theory is that they were symbolic channels through which the pharaoh's soul could leave and return to the pyramid. In 2017, a team of Japanese, French, and Egyptian scientists used special scanning techniques on the Great Pyramid and found a large void above the Grand Gallery measuring 30 by 4 meters. What could be in there, and what should be done with it? That's also a topic of scientific debate. Even the dating of the pyramids is up for discussion. For Egyptian officials, it's simple: they have officially designated the construction date as August 23, 2560 BCE, and they celebrate it annually. But various dates have been suggested. Recently, wood samples that had been taken from the Queen's Chamber a century ago by a resourceful Englishman were found in Scotland. Radiocarbon dating showed a range from 3341 to 3094 BCE. So, that opinion is now out there as well. The Egyptian Book of the Dead states: "I have opened the ways that belong to the heavens and those that belong to the earth, and no one stood against me there. I have exalted your face, O Lord of Eternity!" This definitely sounds like something from the 24th century BCE. And now, here's something from the 21st century CE: On August 2, 2020, just days before the Crew Dragon spacecraft flight, Elon Musk tweeted, "Aliens built the pyramids obv." My opinion on the pyramids is quite simple. Naturally, I'm not a scholar or an archaeologist. I don't know what they were for, and I'm not ready to call pyramidologists idiots or scientists frauds. But as an average viewer, I have this question: We're used to the idea that civilization develops gradually. For instance, people in Ancient Rus learned to build defensive structures called kremlins, or in Europe and Asia, people developed similar fortresses. They started building temples and continued to develop and improve them. At some point, architecture became simpler, and then there was a Renaissance that revived it. But people never forgot how to build houses or fortifications. Then there are the pyramids. We don't really understand why they were built. We've come up with the idea that slaves or free workers hauled stones and polished them, raising them to incredible heights. Modern builders can't even achieve this today. We don't know what they were for. But civilization just left them behind and moved on. The people who lived there were later invaded by Persians, then Arabs. The pyramids just stood there. And really, there are plenty of things standing on Earth - there's a lot of stuff on this planet. So, neither version is fully convincing. Still, I think the people who built these structures couldn't have done it with chisels, picks, and stones - they couldn't have calculated it all. Because, you know, even building a wooden toilet in your own backyard requires some skill and mathematical knowledge. And yet this civilization supposedly lacked such knowledge, but they managed to build such things. That's what puzzles me. As for the questions of what the pyramids were for and who built them, I can't give you answers. But maybe, just maybe, it was aliens. Thank you for watching these history lessons. Until next time.
