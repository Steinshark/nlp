HEALTH MINISTRY OF SOUTH KOREA LIGHTS ONCE A WEEK SO THAT PROMOTE HAVING BABIES. RECENTLY, IN RUSSIA, THEY ALSO PROPAGANDA AGAINST HAVING EVERYTHING.

THAT IS A SAMSUNG STORY. THE BACK OF THIS BUYBACK THE SAMSUNG PROGRAM IS A KOREA BECOMES AN ASIA STORY. STREAK. SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE. LOOKING AT A 50% PROBABILITY THAT THE FED DOES NOT THINK APART FROM THIS, GOLDMAN SACHS AROUND ASIA. ANNABELLE: SAMSUNG LEADING THE KOSPI TODAY THEY HAVE DOWNGRADED PART OF THAT IS DEMAND AND THE SEEING IN KOREA. THEY ARE SAYING THE STORY BEHIND THAT, BUT SEVERAL OF THE PHILIPPINES IS INTERESTING, PEOPLE WERE LOOKING TO BUY INTO WE WENT INTO A CORRECTION, 12, THEY HAVE UPGRADED THE FAR AS THEIR ALLOCATIONS ARE INDIA AT PEOPLE WAIT BUT THE MARKET -- EQUAL WEIGHT, BUT THE DO WE GET A SANTA CLAUS RALLY DETAILS FOR THOU THE ECONOMY THERE IS ALSO WHAT DOES THE FED TRUMP'S POLICIES AND HIS PLANS LET'S BRING IN JANET. WE ARE LOOKING AHEAD TO TRADING IF YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT MARKETS ARE YOU LOOKING AT A CLASSES AS WELL? &gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING, THANK YOU FOR AS WE APPROACH THE END OF THE SHOULD THEY POSITION THEIR I THINK THAT VERY HIGH LEVEL INVESTORS' MIND IS VOLATILITY, OF THEM ARE BECOMING MORE I THINK COMPARED TO IN THE PAST ACROSS DIFFERENT MARKETS IN 2025 AND BEYOND, THEY WILL LOOK WOULD HELP THEM TO CONSIDER SECTOR THAT MIGHT SHIELD THEM THAT CAN HELP THEM TO ACHIEVE AND SECONDLY ABOUT DOWNSIDE BY LOSING ON THE DOWNSIDE IT TO GET BACK TO YOUR PREVIOUS CAUTIOUS ON THE RISK. WOULD SAY WE DO NOT SEE A IT IS MORE ABOUT BUY THE THEME THE PARTICULAR SECTOR LIKE AI WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AS THEY FURTHER ENHANCEMENTS. DAVID: OF PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS AND WHAT I WANT TO GET A SENSE OF THERE WAS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY. CAN CHINA REFLATE ITS ECONOMY? ARE AMONG THE MOST POPULAR &gt;&gt; YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAIN DSI IN INVESTORS WILL LEARN -- LOOK STRATEGY, WHICH IS WHAT RETAIL TO FOCUS ON SAFETY AND THE WE HAVE SEEN THAT A BUNCH OF ABOUT WHAT TO WHEN ADVICE, THEN BASKET OF INVESTMENT, SOMETHING ENABLE AND EMPOWER ASSET CLOSER TO MARKETS AND TO MAKE THESE CALLS ARE NOT TRADITIONAL BE MORE TECHNICAL DYNAMIC RA NGE OF TRADING AMONG COWS, CAPTURE THE OPPORTUNITIES JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE, WE MULTI-ASSET FUNDS, WHICH WE NOW FUNDAMENTAL GET A MANAGING TO AT DIFFERENT FACTORIES IN THE FROM PORTFOLIO MANAGERS TO LOOK AND THEY WILL TAKE A BED JUST A FOLLOW-UP, ARE THESE FOR TECHNICAL IN NATURE OR &gt;&gt; YEAH, THESE ARE FOR INVESTMENT IN MIND FOR SURE, WE ALL KNOW IS HARDER TO GAUGE. ABSOLUTE RETURN TARGET, SO NO DOWN, THE FUND WILL TARGET TO RETURN ON A RISK-ADJUSTED FUND FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE CLOSE TO 9% OF AN ABSOLUTE JUST WANT TO DOVETAIL INTO THE BECAUSE YOU ARE CHAIR OF AN WHEN YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT DO YOU GOT INVESTORS? YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IN &gt;&gt; THIS IS A GOOD QUESTION. THE LONG-TERM WILL BE EVEN TYPICALLY TALK ABOUT FOR BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ACROSS DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT SO THAT KIND OF SUSTAINABILITY AND AS WE LOOKED AT THE RETIREMENT FUNDS, FIRST OF ALL THE NATURE OF THEIR RETIREMENT THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES, AND BENEFITS, BROAD CONTRIBUTIONS. LOOK AT THE TIME HORIZON THAT THEIR INVESTMENTS, AND SECONDLY LIFESTAGE ARE THEY AT? THE MORE CONSERVATIVE STAGE? GROWTH ASSETS VERSUS INCOME FUNDING AND ADEQUACY IS SQUEEZE BLOOD OUT OF STONE, SO CONTRIBUTION STORE ASSETS FOR ACHIEVE THE RETURNS. DAVID: OUR GLOBAL BOND FUND. WHAT FLOWS YOU HAVE SEEN. &gt;&gt; WE DO NOT. DAVID: THE BANDWAGON THERE? &gt;&gt; LET ME TACKLE THE FIRST ONE FUND, BUT THAT IS MORE OF A INVESTMENTS, AND PROBABLY OBSERVED THERE IS THIS WE WERE AT THAT TIME EXPECTING CONTINUOUS RATE CUT, BUT THE DIFFERENT. INVESTORS MIGHT WANT SOMETHING DEPOSITS OR MONEY MARKET THEIR HEADS TOGETHER TO LAUNCH FUND THAT FOCUSED IT WOULD DURATION CURVE AND PROFILE INCOMES TO DISTRIBUTE DIVIDENDS FOR THE TYPING OF INVESTORS WHO SOPHISTICATED, BUT THAT WOULD THIS TREND. ARE RIGHT. ETF'S ARE VERY POPULAR THESE HIGHLIGHT INVESTORS, ETS VERSUS USE VERSES, BECAUSE THEY WERE EXPOSURE. THE IMPORTANT POINT IS WHETHER UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS. ETF'S ARE CHEAP, EFFICIENT, AND TO THE MARKET IN THE MOST MANNER, AND GENERALLY I THINK MIGHT BE DIFFERENT. SOME MIGHT BE MORE THE FEES MAY NOT BE AS LOW AS MANAGEMENT, THE PRIMARY GOAL OF OURSELVES IS TO ADD VALUE TO RISK-ADJUSTED BASIS, SO WILL HAVE TO THINK WHETHER THEY NEEDED FROM A LISTED SECURITY ILLIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS OR EARN IS ABOUT SENSIBILITY AND INVESTORS. DAVID: I WAS NOT ABLE TO ASK YOU ABOUT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT NEXT HAVE A GREAT WEEK AHEAD. STILL AHEAD ON &quot;THE CHINA SHOW,&quot; STARTING WITH JONATHAN BACK.

ANNABELLE: A LOT OF ASIAN CURRENCIES NOT YUAN, THEY ARE COMING UP WITH A ARE LOOKING MORE VULNERABLE IN &gt;&gt; THIS IS A GOOD QUESTION, AND CORRELATION BETWEEN MOST ASIAN COVERING DEALER SELECTION, THE ONES LIKE THE YUAN, RING GET, TARIFFS BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPORT WITH THE DOLLAR WHERE IT IS DOLLAR TRADE. OUT THERE CALLING FOR CROSS CURRENCIES, BUT MOSTLY IT IS CURRENCIES EXPECTED.
