He knows I bought this with him. he is 46 years old. I am 37 years old. I'm embarrassed to wear matching outfits. He may not actually want to do it. So I wore this to match outfits with him.

Where are you? you get out of there I park my car on the side. where should i go From there, walk all the way to the right. Should I go to the right? yes. I understood. I'm headed there what are you doing what are you talking about? what is that? Matching outfits are good, right? what are you saying what are you doing this is weird. We bought matching things. Indeed, we bought matching things. We weren't planning on wearing it like this. are you ashamed of me I'm not ashamed of it. I'm mad at you This is a little weird. We bought the same clothes. We weren't going to wear it this way. You bought it after I bought this. This is the same clothes, so that's fine, right? We can only match outfits for such occasions. I get it. But why are you wearing the same clothes as me on the same day? What about matching outfits? It is okay. This is fun, right? you look good in it We have many other similar clothes. That's for sure. But we don't wear them at the same time. It's not a matching outfit. you get ready Please put down the camera. does this look good on me? you look good in it Are we going out wearing these clothes? That's good, right? I am embarrassed. where are we going Shall we go to RON HERMAN? stop going there. It's strange to go there in this outfit. why? This is the style most likely to suit RON HERMAN. I get it. This is a beach resort outfit. That's for sure. This looks like a delivery car. This is a school uniform. We are like resort hotel staff. HELLO MIKITI. This is delicious. This is delicious. The salads we eat wearing our matching outfits are delicious. Matching outfits are irrelevant. That's not bad. This is delicious because we are matching outfits. Soup is delicious too, right? It's also delicious. I eat this This is delicious. The weather is fine, isn't it? it's good. This is a fancy place. What happened? Are you ashamed of our appearance? I am embarrassed. I feel like many people are watching me. That's why I don't turn my back. &quot;Those people are comedians.&quot; &quot;But they have matching outfits.&quot; There are no people like this. So it's good. We were dating in secret, right? yes. So now we have matching outfits. And it's good to go out like this without hiding, right? That's for sure. That was when we went to BIKKURI DONKEY. The restaurant's menu is large. We really need to give it back. But we didn't give it back. And we were eating with it propped up. Isn't that too suspicious? Is it better now than it was then? That's for sure. So once in a while this is good, right? That is walking and eating in the same clothes like this. Shall we do this regularly? I don't want to do it on a regular basis. why? This is embarrassing. you say it over and over There are people running while staring at us. The person looked at us twice. I understand their feelings. Did you wear matching outfits when you were younger? yes. when is that? That was when I was in junior high school. You're lying, right? I'm not lying when is that? i want to keep that in my mind. you say that i don't get angry I get it. But it's hard for me to say. But I just listen to it. Is that so? That was when you had a shaved head, right? I had a shaved head when I was in high school. That's when I put on one glove, right? yes. I saw that photo. Was it around that time? That was when I was in high school. That's why I only wore one glove. It was VALENTINE'S DAY. My girlfriend at the time was on the basketball team. She hand knitted my gloves. She was too busy to finish it. &quot;I'm sorry I can only make one hand.&quot; &quot;When WHITE DAY comes, I will make another one.&quot; &quot;Please wait until then.&quot; she said yes. But before that she broke up with me. Did she expect you guys to break up at that time? So she may have made only one side of it. I don't think so. She may have had a hard time with my actions. Because I was wearing that one-handed glove the whole time. You are that kind of person. This is when I was on the phone. I told her I was wearing the &quot;one hand glove&quot;. It may have put pressure on her. I couldn't throw it away. why? Maybe she changed her mind. She knits the other glove. And I could have been a couple with her again. You guys broke up, right? yes. It can't be. A man cannot throw away important memories. But you are cute is that true? I want to hug you from that time. This is delicious. This is &quot;urban taste&quot;. I don't understand what that means. what does it taste like? It has no unwanted flavors. That's what I call &quot;urban taste&quot;. does that mean good? It makes good sense. Is that so? This skin is delicious. There is an octopus in this. Is this a squid or an octopus? I was worried that short sleeves would be cold. But this is just fine. I think so, too. Many people are watching us. It's the people who pass by. Those people saw us. It was when we were dating. We often walked along the MEGURO River, didn't we? yes. It's nostalgic. do you want to walk there with me again? We haven't done that lately. That's for sure. you want to do that I may want to. Please state it clearly. why? Say, &quot;I want to walk with MIKITI again by the MEGURO River.&quot; why? I don't think I need to say it. say it you can say that You should know it without me saying it. I don't understand it. I don't think I need to say it during filming. why? You don't say it unless you're filming. you can say then I know that too. say it I want to walk along the MEGURO river with MIKITI. SHOJI!
