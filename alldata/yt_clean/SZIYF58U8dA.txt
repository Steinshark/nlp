[Scoot] -Oooooon! Noon! [Adum and Scoot] -Moon! [Scoot] - Oh, they tricked me... [Adum] -Wamoon! Woman? Women, am I right? You know what's really funny? Before I organized this uh... recording, I was thinking, &quot;man, I'm gonna have to refresh myself on the first movie&quot; and then I realized &quot;wait, no I don't; nothing happened!&quot; So, it's really easy to tell what's going on in this movie, because we don't need to know anything that happened in the last movie, because nothing happened. [Scoot] -No. [Adum] -So... [Scoot] -We're safe. There was a girl. There was boy... [Everyone] -Could I make it anymore obvious [Scoot] -Ah, I didn't even mean to do that. [Gael] -Aunt May! [Scoot] -Where's Uncle Ben? I'd like you to meet.... [Adum laughs out loud] [Adum] -What?! What?! Is it future Bella? [Gael] -Does she have Alzheimer's? [Scoot] -Yeah! [Scoot] -It's future- [Adum] -and her boyfriend's invisible, because it's a reflection. and he's a vampire! [Gael] -You're figuring it all out. [Adum] -See?! [Gael] -The film critic. [Adum] -I knew it! [Adum] -What's going on though? For real, though... Like, I mean she's looking in the mirror future... [Scoot] -How do you understand that she's looking in future mirror? [Adum] -What the fuck?! Oh, it's a dream... [Gael] -Oh, I just got Romeo and Juliet... [Adum] -Well, I figured it out anyway... [Scoot] -Did you think an old lady played Kristen Stewart for the rest of the movie? [Gael] -I mean this is the same conflict that Arwen Evenstar had to resolve... between herself and Aragorn, because she would live forever and Aragorn would eventually pass away... and then she realized that through children that doesn't have to stay the case. [Clip] -How'd you get so old so fast? -I didn't. [Adum] -How'd you get so old so fast? [Gael] -Wow, that's something father's... that's something fathers say to their daughters... [Adum] -Ah... right after a nightmare about getting old so fast, and now going into a mirror again, and checking to make sure she's not old version... Is that the conflict of this movie? Is it like a synecdoche? [Gael] -Ooh, that'd be cool... [Chuckling] [Scoot] -Hey, the same parking lot! I remember this! This takes me back... to the movie that was made less than a year before this one... [Gael] -Oh my god! -Happy birthday... -Don't remind me... [Adum] -Oh... oh! I get why she's worried about getting old, because he doesn't... and she's not going to be sharing it with him! [Gael] -That's what I said. I was talking about Arwen and Arragorn. [Gael] -You following? [Adum] -As soon as you talked about Lord of the Rings, I phased it out... I was like, &quot;oh he's back talking about Lord of the Rings about something... I just like... I... I tuned you out... I'm so sorry... [Gael] -That's okay... I see how it is... [Adum] -You talk about Lord of the Rings a lot... [Gael] -No, no. It's fine.... [Both laugh] [Scoot] -Really, a lot... It's becoming a problem... [Adum cackles] [Gael] -Oh... [Continues laughing] [Adum] -She almost came... [Scoot] -Hey guys, do you think Kristen Stewart is going to bite her lip in this movie? -Jacob! [Scoot] -Remember when he was in... ..... 23 seconds of the first movie? [Adum] -Ha ha! They're watching some vampires- [Gael] -Speaking of Lord of the Rings... is that Bilbo Baggins, I see? [Adum] -Hmm... [Scoot] - Wait, is it actually? [Adum and Gael] -It might be... [Scoot] -I've been to this class... 90 times... [Adum chuckles] [Scoot] -and I've never passed... [Adum] -Oh, flashbacks! Ah... too bad I refreshed... it I didn't need it, but from the flashback... I regret watching the entire first movie again... two hours ago... [Scoot] -We just saw all of the action from the first movie. [Gael] -Oh, it's not him... [Adum] -Are you sure? [Scoot] -Couldn't be less Ian home if he tried... -Well I set up my everlasting wrist... [Adum] -Oh look, he's like, memorized all of it! He's memorized it! [Gael] -What kind of a loser would memorize poetry? [Scoot] -Because he's taken this class 90 times! -seal with a righteous kiss. [Adum] -Seal with a kiss of a rose? [Music] [Adum] -Okay... [Gael] -Okay, that happened... [Adum] -All right. It seems like like... it should be like an episodic tv show... and this is like the second episode, but they just stretched it into a movie... You know? They're like: what other vampire plot can we tackle? With this setting in these characters... Let's do an episode about age. Aging... That's a thing... [Scoot] -Oh no! Now they're gonna eat me! [Gael] -When was the last time anyone bled from a paper cut? [Scoot] -Curly Hair had the sniffs! [Gael] -Oh my god... he literally can't resist... [Scoot] -Because, he just he just remembered- [Laughter and cheering] [Adum] -They just destroyed so much stuff! Where is their source of income? [Gael] -What is going on?! [Adum] -Oh! [Adum] -More! [Scoot] -Oh, she is wrecked! [Gael] -What if... hear me out... [Adum] -Sure. [Gael] -Period blood... [Adum] -I know right? [Scoot] -Seems like a reasonable deal... [Gael] -I think they could make that work. [Adum] -It's OBVIOUSLY what happens... There it is! [Scoot] -Peter Facinelli will run a red light. [Adum] -I've never heard that expression before- is that a straight people thing? [Scoot] -Oh yeah! Cause you guys are gay... -bro [Gael] -I'll remember that one.. run- I'm going to use that for my straight friends to impress them... [Scoot -I... I'm happy to- [Adum] -I know straight things... [Scoot] -impart some disgusting straight phrases for you... -It's gonna be an accident... or illness... old age... [Adum] -Oh my god, this is a synecdoche New York! This is like, she's just obsessing over death now... [Adum making disgusting kissing noises] [Gael] -Okay, it's a printer... [Adum] -Oh no... It's really weird what she just did. Why did she do that? Because, she doesn't want to- she doesn't want to watch herself age. [Adum] -There's like... there's no solo photos of him? I get the cliche of ripping someone out if it's like someone's ex. What are you doing? Do you send that to him? What? Is he just in your room now?? [Scoot] -That's psychotic! [Adum] -This is weird! What is going on? [Gael] -If someone folded me out of a picture and then sent it to me or... [Adum] -I folded myself out of your picture to be like really cryptic and passive aggressive... -I'm coming. [Adum] -&quot;I'm coming&quot; [Scoot] -There you go. -I don't want you to come... [twilight brothers collectively and sarcastically expressing concern] -Don't do anything reckless. [Gael] -Like date a werewolf. [Scoot] -I don't want to tell you how to live your life, but uh... if you could maybe just take my advice and not fuck a dog... [laughter] [Music] -Please... [Gael] -Good acting... -Don't... [Adum laughing hysterically] [Scoot] -The subtible said &quot;sobs...&quot; I don't really buy this as sobbing... [twilight brothers making fun of situation] [Scoot] -Chasing him with a frying pan. [Adum] -That was like a mickey mouse voice.... [Laughter] [Gael] -That was better... [Adums Mickey Mouse voice] -I'm gonna fuck goofy more Pluto [Adum] -Gorsh... [Gael] -No! What have we done? [Adums Goofy voice] -Max, it's goofy time. [Scoot] -Hey guys; it's me, Adam. I can do a flawless impression of Goofy, but only when it's- [starts laughing] When he's about to fuck his son. [Adum] -Wait, she's crying again, almost. No. [Gael] -Oh, she fell. Wait... are we doing the fall thing? [Adum] -I don't know, is that one? [Scoot] -Wwwwwhy did she fall? [Adum] -I'm betting... five for this movie. [Gael] -I'm betting... I went too high last film. I went five and I didn't get it, so I'm gonna go three. -She's all right. -Thank you, Sam. [Gael] -Okay... No questions about the- [Adum] -Yes. Shirtless man. [Gael] -I feel like if a shirtless man- [Adum] -No questions. [Gael] -brought my daughter back unconscious from the woods. I would have some questions... [Adum] -No questions. [Scoot] -Wearing only shorts... I would have at least one or two questions... [Adum] -It's fine. Don't worry about it. [Music] [Adum cackling] [Adum] -Ah... &quot;Art&quot; [continues laughing] [Gael] -Man, I would hate raising a daughter... [Adum] -Would you enjoy raising another gendered of a child? [Gael] -Probably more than I would enjoy raising a daughter, but I don't think- [Adum] -Okay. Sexist... [Scoot] -Yeah. Wouldn't... wouldn't enjoy it, but would enjoy it more than the alternative. [Adum] -Why though? I feel like you- I don't know... [Scoot] -Bitches, man... [Gael] -What am I gonna do? Teach them how to suck dick? I dunno, that's like only thing I can offer. [everyone talking at the same time] [Adum] -I don't- what did your parents do? [Scoot] -I don't think you should be a parent, period. [Adum] -Oh! Remember when she almost got raped? [laughter] [Adum] -Ah, I like that we got flashbacks for everything. This is great. [Scoot] -Oh yeah, and... and the vampire showed up in his Volvo. [Adum] -Ah, he's a ghost now! [cackling] [Adum] -When did you die?! [Gael] -Oh no, is that Obi-Wan? -All right, all right! We gotta take her! [Voice] -Turn around. [Gael] -What is she doing? Does she want to get raped? [Scoot] -Well, that's a complicated question, Gael. But, let me tell you something about women... [Adum] -Oh no... [Laughter] [Adum] -This movie is just so engaging. It's not like we just get trapped in an endless pit of edgy jokes while we're watching it... [Scoot laughs] [Gael] -Is that you, Scott? Is that you like 10 years ago? [Scoot] -Oh no, future me... [Gael] -That's definitely &quot;past&quot; you. [Clip] -You promised me nothing reckless... [Adum laughs] -&quot;You promised me nothing reckless.&quot; [Adum] -Stop, there's a ghost! [Laughter] [Adum] -Why? Why any of this? [Gael] -I've seen that effect on YouTube. -Be careful those things are actually really heavy so... [Scoot] -Oh, he's so strong... [Gael] -uh... the squint... the little like... &quot;You're not supposed to be this strong.&quot; [Clip] -You're like buff! How did that happen? You're like 16. I don't get it... -Age is just a number, baby. -What are you like, 40 now? [group collectively exclaims] [Adum] -Oh, I've heard that before! Here's what we're seeing right now... [Adum] -What was described in the book in this scene? like, what was it literally just like, &quot;I saw his bulging muscles in his back, as he hunched over it and he sweated over the bike.&quot; [Clip] -Hey guys, this is Bella. Bella, that's Quill and Embry. [Gael] -&quot;Quill and Embry.&quot; What are these- no one has a name! Are these therians? Are these like other kin? [Scoot bursts out laughing] [Scoot] -Literally, yes they are! [Adum] -Yeah, I guess so... [Scoot] -They literally are furries. [Gael] -They're literally furries. They're just like... They are the furry names. [Adum] -Oh, I just want one piece. [Gael] -That's that's so... [Adum] -That was a terrible transition! [Scoot] -Who would ever talk- [Adum] -I want to know how that shot ended... [Gael] -Can you imagine tossing a slice of pizza? That's insane! [Adum] -It ended up on top of Walter White's house. Could you imagine if he like... if this... if the shot continued and it didn't cut to later? He jumped up like a dog and bit it in his teeth? [Gael] -Yeah, that would be- [Scoot] -I was just going to say that- like a dog catching a frisbee. [Adum] -Exactly! That HAS to have been when it... She must have just been like, [Adum] -insulting him by doing that. It's funny how she rode on someone else's motorcycle once and now she knows how to drive a motorcycle... [Scoot] -Now she knows how, yeah. [Music] [Adum] -Oh my god! [Gael] -That's another fall. Add one to the list. Add one to the fall list. [Adum] -Okay, so two... if not- [Gael] -What about the time when it was Edward who shoved her into the piano or whatever, and she's like- [Scoot] -She went into a table! [Adum] -That was a fall. You're right. You're absolutely right. You're absolutely right. [Scoot] -Yeah. [Adum] -Three. We're at three. [Scoot] -Three. [Adum] -Oh no... [Scoot] -Why do they hate shirts? [Adum] -I haven't seen the school shooter all film. [Gael] -Oh yeah... I don't remember what he looks like at all... [Adum] -What's he planning? [Gael chuckles] [Scoot] -They uh... [Adum] -He'll be back. -How about face punch? Have you heard of that? -I mean it's that's an action movie. [Adum] -She just recommended a movie called Face Punch. [Scoot] -Face Punch? [Adum] -That's what Stephanie Meyer thinks about movies... [Scoot] -Because, that sounds... better than this movie... Who's this fuckin' dweeb by the way? [Gael] -Uh... her friend... [Adum] -It's like... it's to remind the audience that she's not into humans... because, this is going to go terribly... [Scoot] -That's right... to remind the audience that humans are gross [Adum] -Oh no... [Scoot] -Hey! Good start! [Gael] -Uh oh... [Adum] -This is so silly! Do both, be a total slut! [Gael] -Ha ha, he's a beta! [Scoot] -Did Face Punch make him throw up? [Adum] -Yeah. -What a marshmallow. [laugh track] [Gael] -Ha ha! What a marshmallow what a virgin! Is that Jacob? [Scoot] -Put some fucking clothes on... if I see abs, jean shorts, shoes, and nothing else... it better be John Cena and you ain't John Cena, Mother fucker. Um did I miss a bunch of scenes where Jacob got moody, cut his hair, and got a tattoo? [Gael] -Man, jesus those traps... this kid... this kid's been working out... [Scoot] -Jesus, those traps... I like my 17 year old's on a lot of steroids. -Just... ready? Jacked! I mean he's jacked! [Scoot] -Look at that; why is their relationship different than last time we saw them? [Gael] -I think it's because he's angrier now. [Gael] -Uhhhh....... [Adum] -She's trying to figure it out! -It is me it is me. [Adum w/ dumb voice] -&quot;It is me!&quot; &quot;I'm the origami killer!&quot; -This is over. -You can't break up with me! [Gael] -Because, I break up with you! [Adum] -Peter! [Scoot] -Oh... I break up with you... -I mean, you're my best friend! [Adum] -Oh... best friends... [Laughs out loud] [Scoot] -What? [Adum continues laughing] [Adum] -Oh... I had a vampire boyfriend once... This is where we laid; and also the grass is dying, because our love died... it was much prettier before... [Scoot] -Oh no... Their love killed the grass... [Adum] -No. No it's god.. It's like the lion king when Scar... [Gael] -Oh yeah... [Adum] --rules...god's like &quot;fuck nature now... jeez...&quot; [Scoot] -Everything bad now. [Weird voice] -Hello? [Adum laughs] [Scoot] -Hey! [Adum] -Ah! You again! -I went to visit the Cullins, but... [Adum] -&quot;Veezit.&quot; [Gael] -&quot;I vent to veezit.&quot; [Adum] -I vent to veezit! [funny accent] -De Cullens. [growling] [Adum] -Oh... a tree dog! [Scoot] -What are you? [Adum] -It's... it's like Lady in the Water. [Scoot] -Is this Lady in the Water? [Gael] -It's a narf. [Adum] -It blended in. A narf? Oh yeah, I forgot that's what they- oh my god... -Oh my god... oh my god, I forgot. [Scoot] -It's a Scrunt, you got it. [Adum] -Oh my god, this is cringe... 2009 computer generated effects, goodbye! [Laughs] -Oh no! [Gael] -This better not awaken anything in me... [Laughter] [Scoot] -Is he power sliding? [Adum] -Yes! [Gael] -That's sick! [Adum] -He's playing Jetset Radio. [Scoot laughs] [Scoot] -I think a vampire could fuck up werewolves in this universe. [Scoot] -Vampires seem very powerful the other ones are just big dogs... [Bella] -in the woods! They're not bears! [Adum] -I don't know... [Sherriff] -it's bill what the hell were you doing in the woods? [Adum] -They're not bears. [Bella] -They're wolves! [Adum laughs] [Scoot] -Fair point. -You scared me! [Gael] -Put a shirt on, you fucking... [Adum] -But, then how will they get all these- [Scoot] -Nighttime is no shirts! [Adum] -All these young girls and elderly lonely women to watch the movie... [Gael] -They put a little too much effort into that sequence. [Scoot] -Did he get bigger?! [Gael] -I think he got bigger. [Scoot laughs] -bigger from the last scene! Jesus christ! [Gael] -He is so sexualized... [Scoot] -Stephanie Meyer... is kind of a pedophile... [Gael] -I think she is kind of a pedophile. [Adum] -I mean... I don't know what age she wrote the character, but certainly Chris White's directing this movie... Or, who cast Taylor? It could very well be the producers of the film.. Right? [Scoot] -I believe Chris White's out of this. [Music] [Adum] -That was editing! [Scoot] -That was editing... [Laughter] [Scoot] -We both just said &quot;that was edited.&quot; [Adum] -That's what it was... [Gael] -For all three of us- we were marked. [Scoot] -We saw it, and we recognized that it needed to comment. [Laughter] [Adum] -He's gonna whoo! [Scoot] -Disappointing tf time! [Adum] -Penatly! This is a fine! Whaaaahahaha! [Gael] -Wow... [Adum] -and relish it... [Scoot] -Take your shirt off! Take your shirt off! Take your shirt off! Take your shirt off! [Adum] -All right, where's your shorts now? [Scoot] -You're gonna get in trouble for wearing a shirt! [Scoot] -Yes! I hate clothes! Does that count as a fall for her? [Adum] -Yeah... [Gael] -Okay, so they're not werewolves, they're just wolves... [Scoot] -Yeah, I know, and I hate it... -sink some teeth in them serves 'em right. [Gael] -They don't look as... NEARLY as jacked as Taylor Lautner. And they must be at least- [Scoot] -Ten years old. [Gael] -And they least be at least a few years older... -It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella. I was born this way, I can't help it! [Adum] -Hell yeah... Fuckin' furry... [Scoot] -Oh, the classic &quot;it's not a phase&quot; mom. [Gael] -This music, though... [Adum] -Cool movie. Yeah, they're really dragging this out and not the tf.. [Scoot] -Yeah, they're spending the time on the wrong thing! [Voice] -Don't do this. [Music] [Gael] -Does she want to kill herself all the sudden? [Bella] -You won't stay with me any other way. [Gael] -Why would the vampire with super strength and speed jump into the water? [Adum] -I don't know! Vampires can't swim, or some shit... I don't know, they sparkle! There's new rules! [Scoot] -There's new rules! Listen up. Bill Mahr here, and there's some new rules. [Gael] -Why is the teenage girl going to see yeah the superhuman vampire? [Adum] -Yeah, she's also been submerged underwater for like 30 seconds. I don't know if you're gonna find her. What are you doing? Yeah, what is going on? [Gael] -This was a bad idea... [Adum] -She's dumb! [Laughs] [Gael] -Can anyone explain to me why she jumped in the water? [Adum] -Because... she wanted to save her... [Scoot] -I'm working on it... [Gael] -I don't believe you. I don't- [Adum] -What do you mean?! [Adum and Scoot yelling] [Scoot] -Victoria wants to kill her! [Gael] -Because, Victoria wants to kill her, exactly! She hates her. [Adum] -But, she's like conflicted because she's supposed to be a good person or something... I don't know, I think I figured it out... [Gael] -Yeah, I don't know. I think... I think- [Scoot] -I think you're crazy. [Adum] -HAHA! She's dead. [Music] [Adum] -Oh, new songs. [Scoot] -Was Robert Pattinson not available for most of the filming of this movie or what? [Adum] -He's in it. He's a ghost. Awww! She can warm herself up on him, because he's not a vampire. Now the real conflict starts. She has to weigh the pros and cons of each boyfriend. This is exactly what's happening. [Adum] -Oh man, as soon as it's summertime again she's gonna go back to Edward. She's gonna keep flip-flopping every season like, [Scoot] -Jacob's her- [Adum] -&quot;I'm cold, I'm warm.&quot; [Adum] -She doesn't cum on contact with him. I don't think it's true. I don't think it's like a genuine relationship. Now she's forcing it. [Scoot] -A little bit of cum. I don't believe her; that wasn't a cum, that was her trying to make it happen. I'm team Edward now. I can tell that- [Scoot] -I can tell that Edward makes her cum faster. I think that's how it's meant to be. [Gael] -Who do you think is better for her? [Adum] -Edward, obviously. This guy's a dumb dog... [Gael] -You guys are rude as fuck! [Scoot] -You make a fair point... [Adum] -Oh! See she's shuddering! That wasn't a cum, that was a cringe. [Gael] -Are they gonna fuck in Edward's house? I feel like that's a bit of a power move. [Adum] -I get her. I understand, thank you, Stephanie. I have cringed so hard that I've come before- [Adum] -I'm like, getting into this now. [Gael] -Ah! [Scoot] -My rotary phone is ringing. [Gael] -I want to answer a phone that way... [Scoot] -That's a dumb dog... [Adum] - The 17 year old boy... [Gael] -Are they in Braz- -Is that Christo Redentor in the back? [Adum] -Look at- look at his costume and the set in the background! This is a funny scene! The perform- all of that was so funny! [Clip] -That was Edward. He thinks you're dead! He wants to die too. [Gael] -Oh no... there's gonna be a Romeo and Juliet! [Adum] -Oh no! [Gael] -I get it! [Adum] -Oh no! Oh no! He wants to die too! [Gael] -He's gonna try to kill himself.' Because, he thinks shes dead... and then she's gonna show up at the last second... -I'm begging you... [Scoot] -Oh, what face was THAT? That was awful! [Adum] -He's begging. Like a dawg.... [Gael] -He's a doggy! [Clip] -Ellis! -Bella, you're the only one he can't see coming! [Adum] -Ew... [Adum chuckles] [Adum] -We're just making up rules- [Gael] -By the way, that was a very quick- quickly made up rule. [Adum screams] [Scoot] -What's um... Fuckin' shout at him, or some shit... [Voice] -Jason! [Adum] -Why don't you... why doesn't he get visions with you? [Gael] -Because, that's Alice's special power. Yeah, it's Her- [Scoot] -Yeah, literally each vampire has a different X-Men like special power, and that is hers. Not joking. Not joking, that's real... [Adum] -So, is this suicide by walking into the light? I thought you just sparkled.. and it didn't hurt... is that what you're doing? [Scoot] -Forced suicide by revealing himself as a vampire and then they kill him...? [Scoot] -Why is Pattinson so sleepy? Kristen's also sleepy. Why did the two stars of this movie... do so much heroin before they filmed? -Pain. [Scoot] -Did she say- did she say &quot;pain&quot;? Okay, so that's her magic: is pain. [Gael] -The power word: kill. [cackling] [Adum] -Oh, it's the jokester... [Gael] -Oh, that was cool. I want to do that to people. [Adum] -Ah ha! Was that a full flip?! [Scoot] -That was a full flip. [Adum] -That would scramble her insides! This is so silly. Why?! [Scoot] -Oh, they broke his face a little bit. [Gael] -He broke the stones so much- [Adum] -Yeah! [Gael] -that his face- [Adum] -Out of every part of his body to crack, why would that spot on his cheek? [Adum] -What?! [Scoot] -I gotta respect a movie where... somehow... the fight scenes... are among the most boring things in the movie. [Gael] -I love it. [Adum] -They painted on abs in that shot. [Gael laughs] [Adum] -Legit! Look at those! [Gael] -Yeah, they don't- [Adum] -That's makeup abs, right there. [Scoot] -Yeah, the lines... [Adum] -Those are makeup abs, that's so funny. [Scoot] -Yeah. [Clip] -What the fuck is... WHAT THE FUCK ARE THOSE!!! [Adum] -This is such a dumb face. I can't believe it. What are you communicating? -will make for an intriguing... [Adum laughs] [Gael] -&quot;dessert.&quot; -Oh god... [Adum] -I'd remind you: all we need is one more Bella fall for me to be perfectly on point. [Gael] -What do you got? Four? [Adum] -We're at four right now, my guess is five. [Clip] -Yes, they do look rather juicy. [Adum] -Mmmm... [Gael] -Oh god... what are they gonna massacre these people?? [Screaming in clip] [Adum laughing sarcastically] [Scoot] -Oh, they are! Awesome! Speaking of commentary: I like uh... I like the message that this movie puts forward... Uh... hey, teenage girls. Whoever you fall in love with when you're 16 should be the one you're with forever, and if you can't be: kill yourself. [Gael] -Thanks, Stephanie. [Scoot] -Thanks, Steph! [Adum] -The real 13 Reasons Why. -it'd be nice to not want to kill you all the time. [Gael] -God, that line... [Scoot] -This fuckin' guy... [Gael] -That would be awkward if it didn't pass. If like everyone voted &quot;no&quot; [Adum] -Oh my god, I almost forgot to mention thatfucking guy... plays one of the characters in M. Night Shyamalan's: The Last Airbender. [Gael] -Oh really? [Adum] -Yeah. One of the main characters. [Scoot] -Oh. -If any of them bites a human, the truth is over... -But if I choose it, it has nothing to do with you. -No. [Adum] -My relationship choices... are so complicated... and they hold so much weight... [Scoot] -What's... what's the fuckin' truce? If a vampire bites a human, the werewolves are mad? [Gael] -They added this, really last minute, to raise the stakes. [Adum] -Oh yeah. But, if they bite her: it starts a war between vampires and werewolves. -Goodbye, Jake. -No, you don't speak for her! [Music] [Adum] -Did he turn British for a second? [Gael] -Are we gonna get tf back? We never saw them tf back. [Scoot] -Who gives a fuck about tf... [Gael] -I'm just curious... [Scoot] -As boring as the first way. [Adum] -A woo... [Scoot] -Oh, also uh... Gael, the reason you're not getting tf back: is because they're naked. [Adum in a baby voice] -I'm so conflicted about my relationships now. Oh no.. I have to choose between them! [Gael] -I think you need a friend who you can pet... [Adum laughs] [Gael continues] -and who will not outlive you. [more laughter] [Gael] -So... for those- [Scoot interrupts] -Now... [Gael continues] -For that reason: when it comes to Edward, I'm out. [Scoot] -I realize... I REALIZE Edward makes her cum faster. No one's arguing that. But, he's cold... and she can't pet him. [Adum] -I'm team Edward. You guys are team Jacob, right? Is that how this is going? [Adum] -Oh, you're not. [Gael] -I'm waiting till the end of the franchise. [Adum] -Oh, okay. [Scoot] -I'm saving myself. [Gael] -However, I am currently leaning.... [Adum] -Okay. [Gael] -Team Jacob. [Adum] -Okay. -Marry me, Bella. [Adum] -&quot;Marry me.&quot; Okay... Why not? [Gael] -That's a weird- [Scoot] -Credits. [Adum laughs out loud] [Scoot] -YES! [Everyone laughing] [Adum] -The funniest ending! &quot;Marry me.&quot; [Scoot] -Yes! [Applause and laughter] [Adum] -Ohhhhh NOOOOO! [Scoot] -Couldn't ask for more! [Adum] -What was your favorite scene? [Scoot] -My favorite is probably the uh... the seven minute tf scene. Oh wait... That didn't happen... Fuck this movie! [Gael] -Yeah, I'm with Scoot. [Adum] -I don't know... it's... They're uh... At least more happened in this movie. [Gael] -A little bit. [Adum] -I could name like... five things that happened. [Gael] -It was very slow to start... [Adum] -Which is more than the first movie. What was- I mean, the ending was the best part. [Scoot] -It was pretty good. [Adum] -The &quot;marry me&quot; and then credits. [Gael] -That was a good ending. [Adum] -What is the rating for the first film? It is 5.2 user rating. New Moon... 4.7 This is the exact same thing that happens with 13 Reasons Why. Where like, the fans hate it more = I like it more. &quot;Dismisses the spirit of the I saw one of these imdb user reviews. They're like, &quot;this director doesn't understand&quot; [Scoot] -I do hate it when it misses the spirit. [Adum continues] &quot;the director doesn't understand what made the first movie great.&quot; &quot;Why all the changes from the first movie?!&quot; Question mark, exclamation mark. [Scoot] -What are you talking about?! [Adum] &quot;The first movie was great; hence the all the buzz about New Moon. Then why did they change so much?&quot; &quot;One: the makeup on the Cullen's was awful. they were much more pale ashy and dramatically different from Twilight.&quot; &quot;It was distracting. Not to mention, made Edward much less gorgeous.&quot; [Bursts out laughing] [Adum continues] &quot;which which we all know is half the reason why most 15 to 30 year old girls went to see the movie.&quot; In parentheses, &quot;which I think is most of the viewing audience, right?&quot; &quot;Two: the costume choices were bad for Alice. Really, really bad.&quot; There's a lot of people that were disappointed by this one. I just don't get it. This was much better. Uh... this is ending... Uh, they filmed another movie within a year time span. Just like the Saw movies, except this is supposed to be better. We're all gonna die. Synecdoche. Bye-bye. [Music]
