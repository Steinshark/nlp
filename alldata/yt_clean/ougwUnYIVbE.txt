- I see, I see that thing. - Ba-am ***! -- Before the beginning of the building, behind this white house, they are standing here. In the corner, yes. - What does he say? - Greetings, friends. My name is Mykola Volokhov, call sign Abdula. I am the commander of the &quot;TERRA&quot; unit. Now we will watch a video of how we destroy the *** infantry in the Avdiivka direction with kamikaze FPV drones. We are destroying the infantry, so there will be a lot of censorship on YouTube. If you want to watch without censorship, check out our Telegram channel. The video will be released there without censorship. Traditionally - thanks to all those who support us, and for those who want to join, we have an fundraising. Raising funds to buy kamikaze FPV drones, radio equipment to increase the efficiency of the use of these kamikaze FPV drones. The link to the fundraising will be fixed in the description of the video. We also have a Patreon. And recently we figured out how to make a sponsorship function on YouTube. Become our YouTube sponsor, become our Patreon sponsor. Subscribe to our YouTube channel, subscribe to our Telegram channel. Share this video. Friends, we share all our results with those who support us. I will say one thing - together we will definitely win. Glory to Ukraine! -- Chris, navigator, where is the landing?

Do you smell gunpowder? - This is ***. This gunpowder is just right. -- Orbita, the FPV flew back to the slate, but I understood that they are not there.

Looking for you to enter. -- Vampire, you can take another 82. - Is that really it? some small. Under the covering, ahead of the road. And look behind the road. Just fly up from behind the house, look behind it. It is right here. - Yes, yes.
