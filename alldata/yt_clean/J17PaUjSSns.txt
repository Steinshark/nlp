Utilizing advanced machines and technology has significantly enhanced safety and capacity. Join Wow Tech to explore the most up-to-date agricultural machines and see how the agriculture industry is developing right now. In the south of Denmark, to protect carrots from frost during the cold winter, farmers use John Deere machines to cover the beds with a layer of straw. Besides, the straw layer will prevent weeds from growing and reduce water evaporation. As Central Wisconsin enters the warm summer season, it's also time to harvest cucumbers. At this, cucumbers that reach 6 to 8 inches in length will be picked to make pickles, while the rest will be sold. This laser projector is used during the ripe grapes time, to repel birds that destroy the vineyard Enter the future of strawberry cultivation with BERRY! This robot arm is equipped with a blade and tongs for picking strawberries without affecting their quality. The combine harvester uses a &quot;shake and catch&quot; method to prevent fruits from falling to the ground. An umbrella-like structure over the rows of trees aids in this process. The fruits are then collected through a special sealing system onto a central conveyor belt. Say goodbye to ineffective tree spraying! The DJI Agras T30 features a spraying system that travels along the branches, ensuring even medicine distribution. The JOHN DEERE X9 1100 is a beast on the field, equipped with a large double rotor system! With an impressive width of 45 feet, it maximizes the harvest area with every cut. The DELEKS mini excavator is a compact and ideal machine for confined working conditions, such as residences and schools. The combination of Delta 610 and Bourgault 5810 with a large tank will surely ensure the continuous planting and fertilizing process. This helps the planting for the new crop will be soonly completed in few days ahead After forming these straight and even soil beds, can you imagine how many carrots could be planted each month? Use drainage plows to prevent flooding and minimize losses during rice cultivation. With its firmly equipped blades and strong engine, the Rotadairon can break through compacted soil and incorporate organic matter effectively. Every spring, this machine begins its mission of trimming fruit trees using a circular cutting disc. Before harvesting, the pumpkin roots are cut. Afterward, the machine collects them from the ground, washes them clean, and then places them in crates. The Whole Tree Chipper is commonly used to handle and process oak, pine, eucalyptus, and other trees into wood chips that are then utilized to generate heat and electricity. The weed controller can eliminate all types of weeds, including the smallest and shortest ones. The PMC979-CT has a cutting blade close to the plant base, ensuring that all necessary parts are harvested. Essential minerals such as silicon, calcium, and magnesium are fully provided to the grapes by the BPL-F stone crusher. &quot;The green waves&quot; are neatly trimmed by the Soor machine, a sign of a bountiful harvest. To prepare for the new crop, the field is refreshed by the KUHN Vari-Master L. Its plow blades invert the soil layer, helping to mix nutrients and microorganisms evenly, thus improving soil fertility. This machine uses natural gas, including propane-butane, during operation, which is emitted from the nozzles under pressure. The temperature of the flame directed at the ground can be adjusted and ranges from 1100 to 1800 degrees Celsius. The machine collects grass and forms it into rectangular blocks. Once it reaches 15 bales, they are laid on the ground and prepared for storage. Usually, the onion harvest process is operated by a tractor on row tires. However, to increase capacity, farmers have started using a larger tractor combined with the MacLouis. The STEPA articulated arm hay crane is suitable for large farms, easily moving and grabbing hay from storage to the cow feeding area. Bergtalent is your best choice for cutting grass on hedges or in steep, hilly terrain. The automated feeder will change your livestock feeding routine with just one touch. The Twin D Machine is ideal for orchards with mechanical fences, and a minimum spacing of 19 inches. Let's witness the 150 Case Steam Engine Locomotive pulling 44 plows simultaneously on a field, vigorously plowing and loosening the soil. This showcases the immense strength of steam engines in agriculture. Pumpkins are transported by conveyor belt to the spikes wheel, which is powered hydraulically and pierces through the skin without damaging the seeds. The seeds are separated by a screening drum, and the remaining pumpkin is discharged as compost. Sugar beets take seven months to mature after the seeds are planted. After harvesting, they are cleaned to remove dirt and leaves before being transported from the field to storage. With an impressive width of 72 feet, the Fab Lister plow confidently completes its mission, easily turning a 640-acre field into fertile and breathable land. The 361 RAIN is designed for farmers to provide water to crops in rows. Its advantage is that it uses 20% to 50% less water compared to regular watering systems. The transplanter achieves the perfect combination of human skill and mechanical efficiency. It not only decreases fuel costs and emissions but also ensures that farmers still have opportunities to do their jobs. With the height of a 7-story building, the salt harvester SH1000 is like a giant monster. Aside from its massive size, it has a collection capacity of up to 1,000 tons per hour. The BF8000SL can handle bales weighing up to 2,500 lbs. Equipped with a hydraulic arm, it can easily lift bales onto the table and remove them. The Sampo-Rosenlew Comia features a Topcon automated steering system, which helps the machine move in a straight line and turn when transitioning to the next row. Before planting, tall plants are cut down to 5 to 7 cm to make room for new growth. Conveyors then transport seedlings to the planting beds automatically, ensuring accurate spacing and depth. This is the biggest machine line among the classic wood crackers in Westtech These tongs can easily harvest hardwood trees up to 55 cm in diameter. Harvesting blueberries manually yields only 10 to 20 kg per day. However, with the Grasshopper, productivity can increase by more than 10 times. Baling fresh grass tightly with multiple layers of wrapping ensures its freshness and quality. Bug-Vac acts like a gigantic vacuum, controlling pests both between crop rows and directly on the crops. The ideal time to remove the plastic from early-planted sweetcorn is when the plants have 3 to 5 true leaves. The NEXAT 56M is an ideal machine for large fields where efficiency and speed are important. Its 56-meter-long arm allows it to cover vast areas in just one sweep.
