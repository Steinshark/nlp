Hello friends in the current video tutorial I am going to talk about this array interpolate array function available in the array palette in w so this is interpolate 1D array function and let's see how to use this function so in this program I have made a for Loop so it is generating elements from 1 to 10 and here I am choosing a fractional index and this is interpolate 1D array function and this is the interpolated value [Music] so let's run this program and see what are the results and try to interpret the results so if I put the fractional index as 3.5 so let's see how the result is coming when I run this function the output is 4.5 so how does this output 4.5 is coming since the fractional index is 3.5 so we have to consider the element at index 3. so element at index 3 is this element 4 because the indexing in labview starts from 0. so this is the element which we have to consider and then the fractional index is 0.5 so the difference between 4 and the next element 5 is 1 and 0.5 of 1 is 0.5 so the interpolated value is 4.5 now suppose I change this value to say [Music] 6.3 so I have to consider the element at Place 6 index 6. so index 6 element is 7. and then I have to consider the fractional index of 0.3 the next element is 8 8 minus 7 is 1 fractional 0.3 fractional index of 1 is 0.3 so value coming would be 7.3 so see the value is 7.3 let's see some more um examples of this fractional index so here I have taken these values in an array so I am taking a fractional index as 1.5 so I have to consider the element placed at index one so the element placed at index 1 is 5.2 so um the next element is 7.8 so the fractional index is 0.5 right so I have to uh calculate as follows as the fraction index is 1.5 so we have to see the elements at index 1 which is 5.2 and the next element is 7.8 minus uh seven point next element is 7.8 and we have to subtract 5.2 from 7.8 which results in the value of 2.6 so 0.5 multiplied by 2.6 gives 1.3 so the interpolated value should be 5.2 plus 1.3 is equal to 6.5 so let's run this program and see so the value is 6.5 let's see one more example so here the fractional index is 1.69231 and here are the elements and I am doing the calculation as follows so since the fraction index is 1.69231 so I have to consider the value at index 1 so that value is 5.2 now 7.8 the next value minus the previous value were the one less value the value at 1 less index is some 5.2 so 7.8 minus 5.2 is 2.6 and 2.6 multiplied by the fractional index will generate approximately 1.8 0 0 0 0 6 so the interpolated value is 5.2 plus 1.80006 and the result is seven point zero zero zero zero six right let's run this program so see the result is approximately same because uh 6 is rounded off to one so here we have how many zeros one two three four and five zeros and then six and over here in the in labview calculated answer we have one two three four zeros and if we have the number like over here so 6 is rounded off and the number is 7.00 and 1. so the answer is correct let's do one more question so in this I have taken the fractional index as 7.5 so fractional industry 7.5 means that I have to see the element place that index 7 so that is actually the eighth element so one two three four five six seven and eight so the element is 12.9 we have to see and the next element is 15.5 so we subtract the value of 15.5 uh subtract the value of 12.9 from 15.5 and the result is 2.6 and since the fractional index is 0.5 so 0.5 multiplied by 2.6 gives 1.3 so the interpolated value should be 12.9 plus 1.3 that will give it as 14.2 so let's run this program so the value is 14.2 so this is how interpolate 1D array works I hope you have understood this concept of interpolating in labview and I hope you have enjoyed this video thanks for watching this video
