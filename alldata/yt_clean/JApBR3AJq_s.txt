- Thank you! (audience cheering) Goodness gracious. How's it going everybody? (audience cheering) All right. You guys are wild, this is good. Let's get right into it, huh? It's 2019 and my look is less ideal than ever. (audience laughing) This is real! Here's the deal. I am a Jewish man but I look like an accountant for the Arian Brotherhood, (audience laughing) and I know that. (audience laughing) It's not, I didn't do it on purpose. But I do, I look like the nerdiest guy in the worst prison gang, it's a problem. (audience laughing) It's a serious problem. They're just like, &quot;He doesn't kill people &quot;he does read a lot though, he does.&quot; (audience laughing) Oh man, it's fine though. People are wild, they surprise me all the time with how wild they are. Recently, I was in a shoe store and I was just looking at shoes and a dude comes up to me and he goes, &quot;Oh, your face, that's crazy, &quot;I can't believe you did that!&quot; (audience laughing) And then he goes, &quot;Dude, so what do you, &quot;like a tattoo artist?&quot; And I was like, &quot;No man, &quot;I'm not good at art.&quot; And he goes, &quot;So just no job?&quot; (audience laughing) Like there's no other options! (audience laughing) So it's like, &quot;I can do work!&quot; He's like, &quot;Oh, so what do you do?&quot; And I was like, &quot;Well technically, no job, (audience laughing) &quot;but still, come on man.&quot; And then he goes, &quot;Well, if you need any help &quot;with anything, you let me know.&quot; I was like, &quot;You work here!&quot; (audience laughing) So disrespectful! (audience laughing) People are crazy disrespectful. I live in New York. Dudes, this is a thing that's happening often, dudes who wanna get my attention in public, they will combine with a think I look like with prison and yell it at me. The other day a guy was like, &quot;Hey you!&quot; And I was like. And he goes, &quot;Yeah you, &quot;Harry Potter but make it prison, &quot;come over here.&quot; (audience laughing) It's like, &quot;What? &quot;I'll come over but I didn't like that.&quot; (audience laughing) This is true, the other day I was sitting on the subway, I was sitting, minding my own business, this guys is scooting past me, he looked up at me and he stops and he goes, &quot;Hey, Jim from The Office &quot;did 10 years in prison, &quot;look at you.&quot; (audience laughing) (audience cheering) I was like, &quot;Did not like that one!&quot; I was like, &quot;That one was accurate. (audience laughing) Like, &quot;Come on man, &quot;I'm trying to grow my hair out, &quot;let me live my life!&quot; People on the train were laughing, he was killing! And he goes, &quot;Oh, so Pam left &quot;and you just snapped, huh?&quot; (audience laughing) He has follow-ups! (audience laughing) Come on! (audience laughing) Yeah, just going hard. I've been doing this, which I shouldn't do, I've been reading comments on my videos online. What a nightmare online is, just in general. This is real, I've been noticing this in comments, this is a new thing, a new trend I've been noticing, people, usually older people, will be annoyed withy my tattoos. Now, this is completely new, they will see me and then be like, &quot;Ugh, I remember when &quot;having your face &quot;or your throat tattooed meant &quot;that you were a criminal, &quot;meant that you were dangerous. &quot;Now it just means you're a hipster.&quot; And I'm must like, &quot;Are you disappointed &quot;I'm not a murder right now?&quot; (audience laughing) What is happening? (audience laughing) It's like you assume, firstly, you're making assumptions about who I am based on how I look. And then when I don't live up to them you're, and like it makes no sense. I'm furious, I cannot win with these people. And then, what's even crazier is that I happen to have gang tattoos on my face, I used to be a criminal when I was younger, not always the case, but in my case it is. Sometimes I will tell people that to stop them from being annoyed with my tattoos and then with so much confidence, they'll just tell me, &quot;No! &quot;No, you weren't a criminal. &quot;Listen, I've seen &quot;The Wire and Sons of Anarchy &quot;and you were not.&quot; (audience laughing) They're like experts now. (audience laughing) It's incredible, I spent the entire first part of my life only wanting respect from the scariest people you can imagine and now I'm on Facebook arguing with a 40-year-old woman named Joy. (audience laughing) She's just like, &quot;I bet you've never even &quot;stabbed anybody.&quot; &quot;What? (audience laughing) &quot;I've stabbed two people in my life!&quot; (audience laughing) She's just like, &quot;Not even three? (audience laughing) &quot;I bet they both survived.&quot; (audience laughing) Oh my gosh. (audience laughing) These are the same people who do stuff, they'll be like, &quot;Aren't you worried &quot;about how you're gonna &quot;look when you're older? &quot;Look at all that, &quot;aren't you worried about &quot;how you're gonna look &quot;when you're older?&quot; And it's just like, &quot;Okay, well, &quot;you're wearing dress socks &quot;with jean shorts, &quot;why don't you worry about &quot;how you look right now? &quot;How about that?&quot; (audience laughing) Yeah. (audience applauding) Ah man, let's... I've been traveling a lot, I've been all over. Recently I was in the south and I was at a Denny's. I was minding own business and I looked over and there's like a claw machine, like one of those giant claw machines you see, you know. And I was like, &quot;Ah man.&quot; And then there was a lady in front of the claw machine. Okay, it was a big one, where you win giant prizes, and she was crying. And I was like, &quot;Wow, that's seems like &quot;an over reaction &quot;to losing that game.&quot; (audience laughing) And my friends were like, &quot;No, you idiot, look.&quot; And I paid more attention and then she was crying because her toddler had crawled into the machine. (audience laughing) Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And he was stuck inside of it and she was like, &quot;Come out for mommy.&quot; And he was like, &quot;I live here now! (audience laughing) &quot;I have all the prizes. (audience laughing) &quot;Why would I ever leave?&quot; (audience laughing) So she's hysterical and she's just like, &quot;Someone call 911,&quot; like, &quot;Someone call the police.&quot; And I'm just like, &quot;Don't waste public resources, lady, &quot;now is your time, &quot;win him back, let's go!&quot; (audience laughing) Right! (audience laughing) &quot;The stakes have never been higher, &quot;let's do it!&quot; (audience laughing) I was just like, &quot;Listen, I have $5, I can claw your baby. &quot;Let me try, I can get him! &quot;I can get him.&quot; She did not think it was as funny as you guys did. (audience laughing) So, they called the police or whatever and they brought the fire department and they took the machine apart and got the kid out. And she was very snooty about the whole thing. But I was like, &quot;How funny would that have been &quot;if just some big, &quot;Italian firefighter showed up?&quot; And she was like, &quot;What are you gonna use &quot;the Jaws of Life &quot;to save my baby?&quot; And he's like, &quot;I have ten ones, let's do it!&quot; (audience laughing) Cut to 40 minutes later, he's like, &quot;I'm out of money, &quot;I am so sorry for your loss. (audience laughing) &quot;Will you take a life size &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog instead?&quot; (audience laughing) It's good to be back here in the West, I live in New York now, I came back here for this and to visit my family often. It's also, there's different challenges being here than in the city. Like for instance, recently while I was here, I hit a deer with my car. Yeah, but it's not what you guys think, okay. I did it completely on purpose, now... (audience laughing) How that happened was, I was driving, minding my own business and I'm going down the street and I looked over and I saw a dog and a deer in a parking lot together, okay. I was like, &quot;They're friends, like in Disney.&quot; (audience laughing) But I was wrong, they were not friends, they were enemies and they were fighting pretty hard, okay. All right, I don't, and I didn't even know, the deer was hooving the dog, I didn't even know they did that, all right. And the dog hated it so the dog goes running away from the deer to escape and the dog comes running across the street I'm driving down and the deer comes chasing after the dog and I had a decision to make. (audience laughing) Yeah. (audience laughing) Listen, it was an Australian shepherd, okay, it's crunch time! (audience laughing) I hit that deer so hard with my car. (audience laughing) I swerved and everything. Listen, I hit that deer like my stepdad was riding it. Do you understand? (audience laughing) (audience applauding) That is what I like, a crowd that is not a fan of my stepfather! (audience laughing) Nobody likes you Joe! (audience laughing) I shouldn't use his real name but whatever. (audience laughing) So, (audience laughing) by the way, I should not say this but you guys seem cool, so I'm gonna say it anyway. (audience laughing) Feels so good to hit something that big with your car, it was awesome! (audience laughing) Yes! (audience laughing) Listen, I didn't want to have to do it but if I'm gonna do it, it might as well be cool. (audience laughing) I don't know it felt cool to hit something that big, I get what old people are up to in farmer's markets, I get it. (audience laughing) Like, I understand, now when I'm on the couch and I'm watching the news and they're like, &quot;An elderly gentleman &quot;ran over six people &quot;and slammed his car &quot;into Best Buy today.&quot; I'm just sitting there like, &quot;Live your best life grandpa, &quot;get in there. (audience laughing) &quot;Yeah, you didn't fight in World War II &quot;not to hit someone with your car, &quot;get it.&quot; (audience laughing) So, listen I feel some of you in the audience being worried about the deer and that's fair but don't be, okay. The deer is fine, I drive a 2001 Saturn, the deer is fine, okay. (audience laughing) Yeah. (audience laughing) It seems like you guys might know a thing or two about cars, that is not a good car. (audience laughing) Yeah, my car is so bad that when I bought it I parked it on the street and that night I assume some kids spray painted the word &quot;Wow&quot; on the side of it, (audience laughing) and I did not care, okay. (audience laughing) Yeah so I'm in my 2001 Saturn, the dog runs past, the deer is coming, I slam on the gas, I gave it everything I had. All that happened, okay, was the deer rolled up onto the side of my hood on its side, rolled back onto it's hooves, and then just looked at me like, &quot;What was that about, man?&quot; (audience laughing) And I'm just in my car awkward like, &quot;I'm trying to kill you!&quot; (audience laughing) The deer's just like, &quot;I don't need this.&quot; And it left to go do deer stuff or whatever. (audience laughing) So the deer is gone. I'm sitting in my car, I can't believe this just happened and I realized the dog is nowhere to be found. The dog escaped, yes, I'm an American hero. (audience cheering) I deserve this! (audience cheering) I know, it's like the troops, then me, then firefighters. (audience laughing) I'm feeling very good. (audience laughing) This is literally the most onboard anyone has ever been (audience laughing) with that premise. (audience laughing) I used to put myself above the troops, even as a joke, people were like, &quot;Pull it back, &quot;you gotta be behind.&quot; (audience laughing) So, I'm feeling good, I'm in the street, I just hit a deer with my car, I'm a good person. I'm feeling great. (audience laughing) I'm jazzed up, I'm like pumped up on adrenaline, I just can't believe it happened, I'm like dancing in my car, I was like, &quot;Ah, that was crazy!&quot; And I look over and I see a family, (audience laughing) they're wearing their Sunday best, like a mom and a dad. They're pushing a baby stroller down the sidewalk. And I was like (gasping), they probably saw everything. They definitely wanna talk to me. (audience laughing) So I do a U-turn, (audience laughing) I pull up to them. Have you ever seen a guy pick up a baby stroller to get away from you faster? (audience laughing) Yeah. (audience laughing) Yeah! (audience laughing) I'm just in my car like, &quot;What is this guy's problem?&quot; And then I realize, &quot;Oh no, they have no context for what just happened. (audience laughing) They probably didn't even see the dog! They just see some guy in the middle of the city with his face covered in tattoos, driving the world's worst car, just clobber a deer for no reason. (audience laughing) Then, that guy sits in the street and thinks about it for a while, (audience laughing) spots your family, (audience laughing) does a U-turn, (audience laughing) revealing the fact that he has the word &quot;Wow&quot; spray painted (audience laughing) on the side of his car, (audience laughing) struggles to get his window down 'cause he drives a 2001 Saturn. And then he looks out at your wife and kid and just goes, &quot;I'm a hero!&quot; (audience laughing) He left so fast. (audience laughing) He left his wife, he did not care, (audience laughing) hustling. (audience laughing) Oh man. (audience laughing) I've been traveling a ton this year for comedy, which has been great. I went to two places in particular, I went to Austin and Portland. Both places-- (audience clapping) No, hold on. (audience laughing) Either way you're wrong, both... (audience laughing) If you've seen me before and I bring up a place, I will say nothing good about that place. (audience laughing) I'm not here to be like, &quot;They were great and moving on.&quot; No, so I went to Austin and Portland and they're not so bad but here is a thing, Austin and Portland, both cities where their whole motto is &quot;Keep It Weird&quot; and they're, &quot;We're weird, ugh.&quot; And I showed and like I'm a weird guy. I love weird stuff, I cannot wait to see what I'm gonna see. Nothing weird at all, okay. I'm talking to people like, &quot;When does the weird happen?&quot; And they're like, &quot;It's around.&quot; It wasn't. (audience laughing) There's nothing weird happening in either of those places. I was like, &quot;You guys have to, &quot;the bar has to be higher.&quot; I live in New York, once on the subway I saw a guy, this is real, only wearing the top half of a SpongeBob costume, okay. (audience laughing) Yeah, and what, what was he doing you ask? He was wrestling-- - [Audience Member] Oh! - Another man, okay. Who clearly didn't know him. (audience laughing) That guy he was wrestling was just yelling out over and over again, he goes, &quot;Sponge Bill, no!&quot; (audience laughing) Yeah. (audience laughing) But no one on the train was helping, (audience laughing) there's everyone watching like he seems like he has it under control. (audience laughing) So if you're gonna be weird, you gotta step it up. Also, how dare Austin and Portland, &quot;Keep It Weird&quot; when, how dare they act like they're weird when they know Florida exists. (audience laughing) Yeah, it is just out there doing what Florida does. (audience laughing) Last time I was in Florida, this is real, by the way, this is Googleable information after the show. I'm in Florida, I'm walking past a newspaper stand, I look into the stand, the headline on the newspaper reads, &quot;Local man robs Wendy's with aligator.&quot; (audience laughing) &quot;What did you just say to me?&quot; I read it, I still said that out loud, it was incredible! And also, oh yeah, that's all you wanna say, you don't wanna add any more to that? Like, I don't know, maybe tell us if the aligator was an accomplice or a weapon, how about that? (audience laughing) For real. (audience laughing) Did this guy rob a Wendy's with an aligator or did this guy rob a Wendy's with an aligator? (audience laughing) There's a huge difference. (audience laughing) Did he start a gang with an aligator, throw a bandana on it? (audience laughing) He's like, &quot;We're the aligator boys now. (audience laughing) Let's get to a Wendy's and make this official. (audience laughing) No. So, this is happening, I bought the paper and I read the article and this is real, he used the aligator as a weapon, okay. And when I read that I was like, &quot;Did he at least hold it like a gun?&quot; (audience laughing) Right? He didn't, he threw it (audience laughing) through a drive-thru window! (audience laughing) Yep! (audience laughing) Didn't see that one coming, did ya? (audience laughing) You know who else didn't? The lady (audience laughing) at the drive-thru! (audience laughing) So many things have to happen before you can even throw an aligator. (audience laughing) You have to find it in the wild! (audience laughing) Also, by the way, how horrible is Florida that there is just alligators available to you! (audience laughing) What was even his qualifying material? Was he looking for a specific type? Or are you just the first one he saw, he was like, &quot;This is the one&quot; and he took it, that was it? (audience laughing) So this is real, this happened, in Florida, a place connected to the United States (audience laughing) where we are all living currently! (audience laughing) A grown man, with a driver's license (audience laughing) found an aligator that day. He didn't even build a relationship with it. (audience laughing) He takes this new aligator and he seat belts it into the backseat of his car. (audience laughing) I assume. (audience laughing) I just have no idea how else you keep it from getting into the front seat and biting you, right. (audience laughing) I don't, (audience laughing) I don't know if you guys know anything about alligators but they kinda just do whatever they want. (audience laughing) So he seat belts this dinosaur into the back seat (audience laughing) and then he gets into the front seat and he's like, &quot;Ugh, I gotta make some money today.&quot; (audience laughing) Staring at the wheel, &quot;Ah, I could get a job,&quot; and he goes, &quot;No, no time. (audience laughing) &quot;Spent most my day &quot;on that aligator thing,&quot; (audience laughing) Projects. (audience laughing) (exhaling loudly) &quot;I could rob someone.&quot; He goes, &quot;I could rob a place, &quot;'cause places have more &quot;money than someones. (audience laughing) &quot;Rob a bank,&quot; and he goes, &quot;No, no, &quot;they'll be expecting that.&quot; (audience laughing) He's thinking about it and then he thought, he comes to the conclusion, Wendy's. (audience laughing) They have money and chili, that's the place. (audience laughing) So he drives his new aligator to Wendy's, okay, pulls up to the drive-thru, and the lady at the drive-thru is like, &quot;Hello, how can I help you today?&quot; And he goes, &quot;Give me all the money.&quot; And she just goes, looks right at him and goes, &quot;Uh, no! (audience laughing) &quot;You didn't even come inside? (audience laughing) &quot;You failed at this robbery.&quot; And the dude is so mad and he goes, &quot;Give me the money in the register &quot;or I'll kill you!&quot; And she's from Florida so she's not afraid of death or whatever. (audience laughing) She looks down at him and she's like, &quot;No, &quot;if you had a gun you would of &quot;showed it to me already, &quot;I call your bluff. &quot;Get outta here crazy guy, goo, go, go!&quot; And he's seething mad at this point, furious. And he's like, you know what, &quot;I don't have a gun &quot;but hold on.&quot; (audience laughing) And then he palmed an aligator (audience laughing) through the drive-thru window! (audience laughing) Yup! (audience laughing) He skipped so many steps in that robbery. (audience laughing) If he had a list of things he was supposed to do he would of thrown the aligator, looked down, and just been like, &quot;Oh no! (audience laughing) &quot;I was supposed to threaten her &quot;with the aligator first.&quot; (audience laughing) By the way, can you imagine being her? Just telling this guy off and he's like, &quot;You know what, I don't have a gun.&quot; And you're like, &quot;Wow, nailed it, &quot;really doing it today.&quot; And then he leans back and starts unbuckling the world's ugliest toddler. (audience laughing) Like &quot;Ugh, hey, &quot;someone come and see, this is wild.&quot; And then you look back and an aligator is flying. (audience laughing) Imagine being the car behind him! (audience laughing) Just, sitting there with your girlfriend, like, &quot;What takes so long &quot;to make burgers here?&quot; (audience laughing) She's on her phone, you're like, &quot;Do you even care?&quot; You look back from her and then an aligator soars, whoop, from window to window! (audience laughing) &quot;Honey, get off your phone, &quot;they're throwing alligators &quot;into Wendy's! (audience laughing) &quot;This guy is crazy!&quot; (audience laughing) She's on her phone like, &quot;That doesn't make sense, &quot;they don't even serve alligators here.&quot; (audience laughing) &quot;What, why am I with you?&quot; (audience laughing) So, this dude is sitting there, awkwardly, with no more alligators left to play in the robbery. (audience laughing) Probably thinking to himself, &quot;Ugh, you think if I ask &quot;for my aligator back?&quot; (audience laughing) Such a bad idea to throw it, he didn't even put a fanny pack on it like maybe get some money while you're in there, I don't know. (audience laughing) So, (audience laughing) he drives off. (audience laughing) Yeah, and he gets arrested immediately. (audience laughing) He didn't even wear a mask. (audience laughing) Yeah, he was like, &quot;I'm in Florida, &quot;people throw alligators, &quot;I'll probably get lost in the shuffle.&quot; (audience laughing) Um no, he didn't. They remembered him, they arrested him pretty hard afterwards. The end of the article, this is true, it goes, &quot;No one was injured, &quot;the aligator was safely released &quot;back into the wild.&quot; And the very end of the article it read, &quot;No drug involvement suspected.&quot; (audience laughing) Oh yeah, Florida? That was your sober plan? (audience laughing) What does the non-sober plan look like? (audience laughing) Do you ride a horse and the aligator throws you? (audience laughing) What happens? (audience laughing) I make fun of aligator guy like I have my life together, but I don't. (audience laughing) There's no easy way to say this but my life is not, it's not together. My personal life isn't as good as you think it might be. And some of you are like, &quot;Shane, &quot;your life has to be going well, &quot;look at you on stage.&quot; Yeah, I'm living my dreams and that's nice but also my personal life, tatters. Let me tell you, okay, there's no easy way to say this so I'm just gonna open up and say it, okay. I am 32-years-old and I pooped my pants recently, okay. (audience laughing) Yep, not supposed to do that! (audience laughing) Uh. (audience laughing) I don't like the way some of you are laughing, by the way. If feel like you guys, just to clarify, I didn't just do it like, I wasn't just like watching Batman like &quot;Dah, this movie is good, &quot;I don't think I'm gonna make it.&quot; I didn't poop my pants freestyle for the love of the game. (audience laughing) I had a reason. (audience laughing) Here's what happened, okay. I had food poisoning. Yeah, it could happen to anybody. I had food poisoning, I was parallel parking my car, (audience laughing) that's not a part of this, that's mostly a humble brag but I can parallel park my car. So, I'm parking my car, I had food poisoning and I coughed. (audience laughing) Yep, and it happened to me. (audience laughing) It happened, I pooped my pants. Listen, you know how sometimes you fart and you're like, &quot;That was pretty gross, but I'm okay.&quot; (audience laughing) Not that one! (audience laughing) Nope! I pooped my pants so fast and so hard, it was like somebody else pooped my pants. (audience laughing) It was incredible. (audience laughing) By the way, didn't even know that was one of the options when you cough. (audience laughing) What, that can happen? (audience laughing) I've been pooping my pants for 32 years. Did I say pooping my pants? I meant coughing. (audience applauding) Cut that one, cut that in post, everybody. (audience laughing) We're going to cut that one out, okay. (audience laughing) Listen, you guys don't know my life. (audience laughing) I've been coughing for 32 years. (audience laughing) Not once ever, after cough for 32 years have I ever been like (coughing), &quot;Whoa! (audience laughing) &quot;What was that?&quot; One of my friends was like, &quot;What just happened?&quot; I was like, &quot;I coughed, &quot;I almost pooped my pants.&quot; He's like, &quot;Yeah, that can happen, &quot;gotta watch out for those.&quot; Not once ever! (audience laughing) Like, the cough waited 32 years and then betrayed me. (audience laughing) Like, once I was in ninth grade and I was giving talk in front of the class and I coughed and my body was like, &quot;Do we do it now?&quot; (audience laughing) And then puberty was like, &quot;No, we will embarrass him. (audience laughing) &quot;You, hold back, wait 20 years, &quot;then take him out, &quot;right before he has to do comedy.&quot; (audience laughing) Yeah, I was parking at a comedy club! (audience laughing) It was worse case, so I get out of my car, I can't get back into it, it's not one of those. (audience laughing) I was like, &quot;What do I, what do I do?&quot; And I was like, my first plan was to buy the pants off of a homeless guy. (audience laughing) But they are never there when you need them, the homeless. (audience laughing) My second plan was to buy the shirt off of a guy wearing two shirts. But here's the thing, if you try and buy the shirt off of a guy wearing two shirts and you tell him you need it 'cause you pooped your pants, he will run from you, so. (audience laughing) I was gonna wear it like a, I don't know what I thought, anyway. So I look across the street and there's like a mall. And I was like, I gotta get over there, so I waddle over. You know, yeah, it's a shameful walk. People can tell, they can. A kid tries to talk to me and his dad is like, &quot;Get away from him!&quot; And this kid is like, &quot;Because of how he looks?&quot; And he's like, &quot;No, other things, go! (audience laughing) &quot;Get away.&quot; (audience laughing) So, I get into the first clothing store I can get into and the guy working there is like, &quot;Hello, how can we help you today?&quot; I was like, &quot;Come here, &quot;come here right now.&quot; And he's like, &quot;Oh, what's going on, what is it?&quot; And I was like, &quot;Here's the deal man, &quot;I have fully pooped my pants.&quot; (audience laughing) And he just goes, &quot;Excuse me!&quot; I was like, &quot;Am I stuttering right now? &quot;Daniel, okay! (audience laughing) &quot;I need you on team me right, &quot;there is no time. &quot;Do they not train you for this?&quot; (audience laughing) He's like, &quot;What do I do?&quot; I was like, &quot;Go get me a pair of jeans this second.&quot; So he runs off and he comes back and he goes, &quot;I have mediums and I have larges.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Give me the mediums!&quot; And he looks right at me and he goes, &quot;Do you wanna try those on?&quot; (audience laughing) I said, &quot;Do you think &quot;this is a game Daniel?&quot; (audience laughing) &quot;I need the key &quot;to your employee bathroom &quot;and an undisclosed &quot;amount of time, man. &quot;How many times you gonna &quot;make me say it, &quot;I have pooped my pants!&quot; (audience laughing) In a weird twist of fate, I am wearing those pants currently. (audience applauding) Thank you so much everyone, have a great night!
