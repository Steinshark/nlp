I underestimated you. Maybe next time you will estimate me. I'm really proud of you. Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer. And We are prepared to reject that offer. Michael, you haven't even heard. Never accept their first offer. What is your second offer? $12,000. Are you kidding me? That is insultingly low. I don't even want to hear what your first offer was. What do you hear? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Here's the situation. Your company is four weeks old. I know this business. I know what suppliers are charging. I know you can't be making very much money. I don't know how your prices are so low, but I know it can't keep up that way. I'm sure you're scared. Probably in debt. It's the best offer you're going to get. I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation. Your company is losing clients left and right. You have a stockholder meeting coming up, and you're going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding. So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO. So I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin. I think I just have to wait out you. Okay. Now, I don't know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How's about $60,000? 60 thousand. Michael. Well. We'll have to talk. We're going to have to talk about this amongst yourselves, okay? No, please take the room. We are outside. Take your time. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. Yes. So I wanted to give you that. It's a letter of recommendation. This is going to be good. To whom it may concern. Good. Real personal. Thanks, Michael. The dictionary defines superlative as of the highest kind, quality or order, surpassing all else or others. Supreme. That's great. If I wanted the dictionary definition, I'd buy a dictionary. I define it as Dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend. He is of the highest kind, quality and order. Supreme. Lots more like that. Really repetitive. What's this? 2:45 behind the building. Paintball. Oh. Rahh, no. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Oh, come on, come on, come on. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Ha ha ha ha. Right down the street. Kenneth Road. Born and raised. Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County. And I do not intend on moving. I know this place. I know how many hospitals we have. I know how many schools we have. It's home, you know, I know the challenges county is up against. Here's the thing about those discount suppliers. They don't care. They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business. And then once we're all gone, they jack up the prices. I know it's mad. It's terrible. It is. You know what it really is? Oh, I don't. Know. I guess I could give you guys my business, but you have to meet me halfway, okay? Because they're expecting me to make cuts. Well, corporate's going to go ballistic, but you think we could. Jan? Sorry. My meeting ran late. Really? Yes. Jan Really? With a rep from Hammermill. There. Exclusive with. Staples. Used to be Evan. I'll call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell Hammermill products. Yes. Well, Michael, I. I underestimated. You. Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me. Pam Caso. Sorry I'm late. I had to race across town. Oh, Michael. Wow. You did these freehand? Yep. My God. These could be tracings. Oh, look at this one. Wow. You nailed it. How much? What do you mean? I don't see a price. Um. You want to buy it? Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my window and there's my car. Is that your car? Uh huh. Oh. That is our building. And we sell paper. I'm really proud of you. Thank you. What? Do you have something in your pocket? Chunky. You want half? No, thank you. It is a. Message. It is an inspiration. It is. A source of beauty, and without paper it could not have happened unless you had a camera. April 13th, 2002. Dwight, I'm in a meeting. That's very. Rude. I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002. That is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook. But we're hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased. Maybe we should schedule a meeting on another continuing notice. My persistence and recall continuing. You call Dunder Mifflin and your order was filled within an hour. I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs, is it not? We all know that the economy is bad and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month. What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you. Why don't you guys just email me your best offers and we can finish it up that way? That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the penguins Box seats, as usual. Okay. Sure. Good, good, good. I will see you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, how's your gay son? Excuse me. I color code all my info. I wrote gay son in green. Green means go so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means orange you glad you didn't bring it up? Most colors mean. Don't say it. How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore? I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the Civil War is that brother fought against Brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery, in that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important, though. That's just how the world works, I guess. All right, buddy. Hey, what up? Sure glad you're back. You are relieved. You have no idea. So what did I miss? Well, I tried to. Put all the birthdays together at once. So. Terrible idea. Yeah, okay. I did that. Rookie mistake. You did do it? Uh huh. Yeah. Just wait ten years. You'll figure it out. Well. I don't think I'll be here in ten years, but. That's what I said. That's what she said. That's what who said. I never. Know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, You know, to lighten the tension when things sort of get hard. That's what she said. Hey. Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward. I don't understand why you keep picking on me. Oh, for the love of God, you just do. And I don't know why. So please help me understand. Fine. Here it is. You are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way. Well, Stanley, maybe you are feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well. Michael, I've known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories? All right. You don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me. You can't talk to me that way in this office. You just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it. Fair enough. I am a good person and sometimes good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield. Hey, I don't get no respect. No respect at all. Oh. There's a lot of people I'd like to thank, but I think we all actually want to thank you, Michael. Oh, thank you. I mean, we actually really all want to thank you for everything. Oh, my God. Something's happening. 9,986,000 minutes. We actually sat down and did the math. 9,986,000 minutes. That's how many minutes that you've worked here. In costumes. And impressions, in meetings, in cups of coffee for birthdays. More meetings and email forwards. You made. Us read. 9,986,000 minutes. That's like watching Die Hard 80,000 times. You hit me with your car. You helped me get off drugs. I watched you When you sleep. I forgive you for kissing me. Remember to. Call. Oh, you got. Oh, God. Call, text or call. Call. Measure, measure your life in. Remember to call. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Remember to call. Yeah, Yeah. You got to remember to comment. You call. Yeah. Okay. Well, this is going to hurt like a mother.
