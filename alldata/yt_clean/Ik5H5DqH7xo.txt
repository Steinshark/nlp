It feels like flying to me. Then I started noticing - [Host] Lutra has been for nearly 20 years, but until she met the other looters, she didn't have a good way - [Lutra] Some things are like, well, if nobody claims this, I'm but at the same time there's and hearing the story. - [Miranda] I think this is I'll put that in the special bag. - [Kea] That's a good day. - [Miranda] What?
