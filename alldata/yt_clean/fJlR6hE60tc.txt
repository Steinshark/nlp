Babe, I had a dream that you were a witch. Turn around. Attention! Tonight is the big Halloween ball! But! Nobody should come tonight! Evil witches are hunting students! They're turning our skin green! God, she looks like a freak! Who would believe this stuff? Why is her hand green? Got you guys! You totally fell for it! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Nice! Nice. You did it. I tried to warn you, but you all just think it's a big joke. Is anyone else Mm-hmm. All right, guys, let's do it again. I'm gonna finish my lunch, Sounds good. Let's get this bread. Wow, you look hot. Yeah? Come a little closer. What's wrong? You looked like an ugly witch That would be a nightmare. You look so ridiculous, Lena. Hey! What? I'm just being honest. Your costume isn't really sexy. It's weird. Nick, why do you always Maybe I should ask other boys Wait! Lena! [Best friends!] Wait, where is everyone? Were they really that scared off by what Kate said at lunch? Alan! Bodyguard Nick is here. Yes! What, did you guys seriously think Hey, it's good to be prepared. You never know I told you not to come here. It's too dangerous. Kate! Well, don't you recognize me? Principal Gaby? Yes, yes, it's me. Now welcome to the night of Fear Ball. Don't laugh at your principal! Now come on in. Let's have a party. Where'd she go? Help! That sounds like Principal Gabrielle. We need to find her. Let's split up. We'll go upstairs Boo! Why are you guys freaking out so much? It's obviously a dumb prank. Shh! Whoever kidnapped Kate, I'm starting to think Blah, blah, blah. You guys are so gullible. Look at you scared, all creeping around. I ain't scared of nothing. I can do- It started! What started? I told you, the witches are here to hunt. I'm so scared, Alan. Don't be scared, Chelsea. We'll figure out I have this magic book. It has some spells Then it's settled. There's some studying we have to do. Let's go to class. Don't you think Anirudh, bro, your skin looks disgusting. His skin? God, I'm gonna be sick. We have to protect ourselves. How? I've been studying this for years, but I never tried the spell before. Was that supposed to happen? I don't know. Let's just keep going. A person's soul is made of music. If there is an evil witch nearby, music will help you defeat them. What does that mean? If you chant this song, the evil witches will reveal themselves. Let's go. We the heroes, nothing can stop our destiny. We make our legacy, look how we rise, it's our universe. This doesn't seem to be working. Is there anything stronger? Are we sure we can handle this? We have no choice, only the blood sacrifice make the witches reveal themselves. Wait, does that mean It's to protect all of us, Chelsea. No, I don't think I can do this. We have to try. Three, two, one. Go! Is that all? I guess that didn't work either. What's the point of my studying I don't know what else we can do. Don't give up, Kate. We can do this. Oh my god! What was that? Recite these words, and the goblet and the witches will reveal themselves! Give me green! Give me green! Chelsea, what happened? She's a witch! Chelsea! Don't! She's one of the witches! Don't you see, Alan? Chelsea can't be the one haunting us! There has to be another explanation! The spell worked! It drained her energy! How do I know you're not a witch? Why would you think that? Didn't your hand I think the witches saw me They put a curse on me and made me And it worked! Nobody took me seriously. I guess that makes sense. I'm sorry. We'll figure this out together. No witch will get past this barrier. And? I made garlic bread. Chelsea? I'm so glad you're okay. We heard screaming from upstairs. We're happy to see you safe. Lena... Can we talk? Girls only, please. What's wrong? I want to tell you the truth. I am- Lena... What are you gonna do to me?! Now you're one of us. Where's the garlic when you need it?! I think that's Lena's voice. Alan! A person can break a witch's spell Metus meos oppone! Face my fears! In accounting, precision is key. A single misplaced decimal leading to hours of tedious correction. We need to not only but triple-check. Make sure you balance sheets, and retained earnings. When did I get this accounting job? Accounts payable and receivable? I have to reconcile Green coffee? Wait a second. My worst nightmare is to be stuck Here's another stack of reports I'm finally free! Thank you, Alan. We need to finish with this. Go hide in the classroom. Me and Alan will take care of the rest. Now I know how to defeat these witches. Let's go save Lena. Let's split up. I'll check the second floor Lena? Quiet, join us and become a witch or die. But I don't want to be a witch. Then what do you want? To be good. Metus meos oppone! Face my fears! I'll never be proud of you! Mom, please. I'm trying. I want you to be proud of me. I always told you Mom! OMG You little failure! I couldn't do it. Chelsea, I know how to defeat the witches I'm sorry you had to see me that way. Chelsea, I don't know but right now we have to save Lena. It sounds like Let's go! Nick, come on, what are you looking at? We don't have time. Principal Gabrielle? It was you It's not just me, but my servants too. Nick and Anirudh, she kidnapped you again? Yes, you stupid boy. I told Miss Gabrielle where he was hiding. Stupid man, you'll never defeat us. You think your little book Why are you doing this to us? Alan, you stupid boy. You and all the other boys constantly make fun of women for their appearances. Saying that green skin is disgusting. God, she looks like a freak. You look so ridiculous, Lena. You looked like an ugly witch That would be a nightmare. On Halloween night many years ago, I attended a ball at this very school The boys made fun of me scary and I was ugly. They humiliated me I went home and cried. But then I decided and I used my newfound powers men and recruit women Every Halloween my coven school boys who walk these halls. And this year will be no different. I'm so sorry But there's a way we can all work together to change the world through good, not evil. What's evil about justice? Chelsea, no! Get him! What?! You're a witch too? How? Remember when you casted a spell Yeah, your chaotic magic But I won't be a witch who's evil. I won't be like you. Alan, I'm sorry I didn't tell you. Once I realized I was a witch and saw myself turning green, I was afraid You kept saying it was ugly. Chelsea, I'm sorry for judging you, your skin, it's beautiful. And look, what you were ashamed of, it saved us. Girls, I know you're in there. Lena, you're hilarious and your jokes brighten up our every day. And Kate, I know you're in there. Can you hear me? Lies! Don't believe them! Take them! Metus meos oppone! Face my fears! We're breaking up. Chelsea? Why? Wait a second. Green tears? My worst nightmare is for Chelsea This is my biggest fear. Chelsea, focus on me. Do you love me? No, you stupid boy. Chelsea, I'm sorry I didn't appreciate but green is beautiful. Alan? Chelsea, if you break free I promise I'll never inside and out. Chelsea, I love you! Alan, I love you too! I'm sorry. We were judging you girls It's what's on the inside You're all beautiful inside and out. Thank you, Nick. I really needed to hear it. I'm glad you guys finally realized that. We're so lucky That was my goal all along. To teach you boys All women. Kind of a crazy way to do it. Though, it worked. Yay, women! I'm happy to know that you caused We're all going to be nicer to you too, Miss Gabrielle. We owe you that. All these years of being a witch, maybe it's time to give it all up. I will never cast as you boys remember Of course, Principal. Then it's time to get rid of the cauldron, and I will stop turning everybody green. Stop! Actually, green is beautiful. If used for good, it can make the world beautiful too. One, two, three! Whoa! I believe that green You guys! We survived Halloween! Go green! Click here to watch another episode of Alan's Universe.
