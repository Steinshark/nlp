You got what I just said? Yes, Father. Good. When you see a beautiful mermaid down there, pull her up and she'll give us luminous pearls enough for us to pay this year's tributes. Understand? Yes. Father, Uncle Zhu, Uncle Jin, I'm going in. Haishi! Aren't you afraid at all? Don't you always call me the best swimmer in our village? I can do this. When you see a beautiful mermaid down there, pull her up and she'll give us luminous pearls enough for us to pay this year's tributes. Understand? Haishi! Haishi! Come here. I got you. I got you. Let me untie the rope. Wait. Hey. Father! Father, look! Come! Come over! Ye, - Come! - I'm here! Come on! Come here. Come over! It's now or never! Haishi, I'm so sorry, dear! I don't have a choice! Rest in peace. I'll burn you goodies every day. I'll give you whatever you want. Luminous pearls! There they are! Haishi! Haishi! If it weren't for the Emperor's greed I'd never trade your life for merfolks' tears! I'm very sorry. Father! Father! Haishi! Haishi! Father! Haishi! Haishi! Come here! Father! Father! Father! Father! Father! Father! Father! Father! Father! Father? Father? Uncle Jin? Uncle Zhu? Father? Father? Uncle Jin? Uncle Zhu? Father? You call these pearls? Grains of sand are bigger than them! Sir! Please! Please spare us! Have mercy on us! You lowly lazybones! - We've handed in all our pearls. Take them all away! Yes! Please don't! Spare us, sir! My husband and daughter are at sea. They'll bring back pearls! I have the finest luminous pearls! - It's Haishi! It's Haishi! It is her! It's Haishi! She's back! Haishi is back! Thank heavens! Has she got the pearls? I have the finest luminous pearls! She has the pearls! We're safe! Is she back alone? We can live! Where's her father? And Zhu and Jin? Right. Where's your father? She's the only one back. Where's Jin? Where's Zhu? They went to the sea together. Where are the rest of them? Sharks ate them. Sharks? How could this happen? - Enough. - and Haishi's father were both killed. Poor men! - What should I do? The pearl tax got them killed! I can't live without you! My poor husband! Be quiet! It's annoying! Our good days are coming. Shut it, peasants! - Don't make a sound, or I'll feed you all to sharks! Guys, do you see any luminous pearls here? Not at all. - No. But... This poor place doesn't even have the cheapest pearls, let alone the luminous ones. Burn down this village! Pearl tax is levied by His Majesty. Without pearls, Those who refuse to comply will be regarded as rebels! - Kneel! Haishi! - Let go of me! Go! Move it! Haishi! Mother! Move! Get up! She stabbed General! Everyone, seize her! Don't let her get away! Run! - Over there! Go! She's there! Go! Go! Over here! Stop! That way! Go get her! Stop! Stop there! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! What's your name? Ye Haishi. Would you like to go to the capital with us? Will you save my mother? I promise they'll all be safe. If you can keep your promise to protect my mother and the others, I'll go with you. If you choose to be a girl by my side, other than safety, I can't guarantee you anything. But, being a boy will enjoy a lot more except for safety. What do you want to be? A boy! I want to be a boy! Let's go. Master. I recalled the way you looked at me when I found you at the war-torn Red Plain back then. Yes. That was four years ago. True. She just gave me the same look. With proper guidance, she can make a difference to the world. Take care of her mother Inform assets at Jifeng Pavilion to look into those troops and track down every pearl along the coast. Yes, Master. Off you go. Father! Father! Father! A bad dream? Yes. We're still in the carriage. Did you bandage me up? I did. I'll repay you for all that you've done. Sure. Sir, may I ask why you're wearing a mask? Are you scared? A little bit. Don't be. Go back to sleep. Fine. His Majesty has shot a pheasant! Great precision! You're a wonderful archer, Your Majesty! Very well done! I expected to see Yet there are no tigers or bears in sight, but only a few pheasants and rabbits. Your Majesty, you're the chosen one by heaven. Your might has deterred them from approaching. Tigers and bears are unavailable, and I'm sick of shooting birds. Why don't you run around on your horse and I'll shoot your hat off? Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Spare me, Your Majesty! Please! This is no joke! I hate liars the most. I'm not! I'd never lie to you, Your Majesty! Please trust me! Your Majesty, one of noble birth shall never put himself in danger. Keeping dangerous beasts away from the hunting ground is a tradition for 100 years. We're doing the same for your safety, especially when Prince Yi's remaining forces might take this chance to strike again. I can't wait for them to do it! Alright. I'll be here waiting for them. His Majesty has left for the hunting ground. What? Your Majesty! It's dangerous to go inside! Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Does it still hurt? Not anymore. Tianqi City is right ahead. Look outside if you like. Alright. Just trees. When will we arrive in the capital? In about one hour. Sir, I see two horses. They're from the Palace. Stop the carriage. Fire the signal. A signal from Commander. Hunting ground in the west. The signal will expose our location. Take her away on a horse. Yes. Sir! Peaceful days are over much sooner than I expected. I'll take care of them. Just go! Help! Somebody help! Watch out! Sir! You... you're Lord Qinghai! Didn't you die long ago? Whatever. I'll kill you both to avenge Prince Yi! You will die now! You're as clumsy as before. There's blood on your face. I know you're a neat freak, so I'll let the arrow stay for now in case you're showered with blood. Pull back! Is the arrow poisoned? Capture them alive! - Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty! - Sir! - You're wounded! Please punish me, Your Majesty! Pearl tax is levied by His Majesty. Those who refuse to comply will be regarded as rebels! How are you holding up, Commander? I'm fine and worry-free as long as you're safe, Your Majesty. Your well-being concerns the entire state. I hope you won't take such a risk again. Enough. That's not just me talking, but Zi... That's Emperor Xu. I can't believe I saved the one who imposed the pearl tax on us that killed Father and many others. Get him back for treatment immediately. I'm bored. My day is totally ruined. - We're going back. Sir! Steady! - Go! Be careful! Leave Commander to them. Get out, all of you. But your wound... Leave me alone! Yes, Your Majesty. Scalpel. Wait! What are the chances, Physician? The poison has only gone under his skin. The infected tissue must be removed quickly or he'll be in critical condition. Fang Jianming... Sir! You've been here all night? Yes. You must've figured it out yesterday that I'm the Commander of Secret Force. You'll never be safe with me. I... It's not too late to regret. I said I'd repay you once I grow up. I can't go back on my word. Follow me. Bow to Commander as his disciple. Sir, please have tea. Stop calling me "sir". From now on, you'll be a Fang after me and I'll be your master. Master! Rise. Greetings, Young Master Haishi! Your Majesty, during yesterday's hunting, for not being there for you when you were ambushed. I went on the spur of the moment without telling you, Mr. Su. It's not your fault. You may rise. Thank you, Your Majesty. Secret Force will hand over Prince Yi's remnants I want you to take it from there. Thank you for your trust, Your Majesty. Make a clean sweep and leave no evil behind. If there's nothing else, you may leave. Good day, Your Majesty. (Confession: I served under Prince Yi (The assassination was to avenge him. General, it's late. Their confessions can wait until tomorrow. The captives are hard to crack. They haven't coughed up anything important under torture. I must bring all their accomplices at large to justice as His Majesty asked! General, two of Prince Yi's followers were dumped outside. General, they're still breathing. Someone must've knocked them out. Take them into custody for questioning. Yes. Master. Did you just come back? Yes. I've completed the task as per your order, Master. Good. From now on, treat her as your younger brother. I hope you can watch each other's backs. - Yes, Master! Haishi. Young Master. Don't be so formal as if we're strangers. I've always wanted a younger brother. And now, I have you. From now on, we're family. Thanks. Young Master, have you seen my mother? How is she? "Young Master" again? Your mother is good. She asked me to give you this and tell you everything is fine at home. Be good here and study hard. This is the fishing shuttle my parents have been using. Thank you, Zhuoying. You should thank Master for it. How do you feel at Jifeng Pavilion? It's better than good... (Jifeng Pavilion) Every character has its own structure. It should be able (Haishi) Kiss me with all your heart This unacceptable true feeling Suits us well Sweeping across the moon I won! Cool wind finds its effort vain Beneath the tranquility You lost. The world sees sacrifices (Fang Haishi) Playful and simple I am Hate to stay neutral and forbearing Here's your key post. Every strategy you use might cost tens of thousands of lives. No mistake is allowed. Men of loyalty and integrity To think of you I don't need your response or company One more time! It's the blooming season Father! The best time of a year You're safe now. It's over. It's just another bad dream. As in a city in wash painting A man saves every possible stroke Lean forward slightly. And refuses to reunite Feet shoulder-width apart. Heart and soul Shoot! I did it! Deep is the sea of tears A lone skiff is drifting Carefree I feel In this cold world I long for love (Fang Hai) Go and find the one By water or land Throw myself to you barefooted Haishi. Haishi. Master! You're dozing off on the rock. Go back to your room or you'll catch a cold. Yes. Bitterness comes and goes Sweetness is tempting and lingering Throw myself to you barefooted If love is greed Master, let's try again! Then everyone is greedy If plants could speak They'd wish to have broken hearts Bitterness comes and goes Sweetness is tempting and lingering Master, come back as soon as you can. Be careful out there. Don't get hurt. Don't go for too long. I'm always here, waiting for you, Master. Why sit alone Don't worry. I'll be fine. Take good care of yourself while I'm away. I will. Master, see you soon! Can we reunite heart and soul The rest of your life Will be a lonely journey So do not try to heal The part with me in The way I paved for you Mists in my eyes And becomes a vivid token Master! Master! Master, I knew it. I knew you'd be back today. I made ginseng soup for you. Let me go get it. No need. Master, you're wounded! Close the door. Yes. Close it from the outside. What? Master. Master, let me check. It looks bad. I'll apply the powder to you. It'll sting a little bit. Master, bring me with you to the Palace next time. I can be of help. You can't wait to work there? Master, Jifeng Pavilion is the Secret Force under His Majesty. I'll have to work for him I couldn't do anything but now, I've grown up. I have enough skills. I mean, better sooner than later, right? Hang in there. I'd rather go out with you and Zhuoying than worry for you at home every time. Master, you can send me in now so that I can know my way around first. Then by the time you need me, I'll be of greater help. That can wait until you get older. Master, you can't even think of a better excuse. You've been telling me the same thing all these years. Commander. Come in. Commander. Get the word out. Take action immediately. No delay is allowed. Yes. General Su, you've been on the rise ever since the Battle of Tongping City. Good for you! Said by the sore loser, Prince Yi's man. Sadly, you're too blind and deaf to notice your enemy is right under your nose. Is that how Chu Zhongxu repay you for your loyalty? Addressing His Majesty by his name is a capital offense! Don't you want revenge? I've anticipated this day since I vowed to But you should know Fang Jianming, who killed your father, is still alive. He's there with Chu Zhongxu, doing all kinds of evil I don't buy your nonsense. During the hunting ground Fang Jianming's mask fell off his face. I saw him with my own eyes. Have you never seen that face underneath the silver mask? Clearly, your emperor doesn't trust you as much as you thought. Dig deep. No one can get away! Yes, sir! Right Force has moved up the attack. Once they move, Prince Yi will see through If his troops come straight to us, we won't stand a chance. Charge! Father! Father! Fang Jianming, you began the encirclement early and my father died for it. You must pay the price for his death. Fang Haishi! What's got into you? You were always stingy even when we asked you to pick up goodies with public funds. What's with this splurge? Sea cucumbers and ginseng? Nice! What...? Don't touch it. That dish isn't for you. Why can't I? I made all these for Master. He's my master, too. Why can't I eat it? Were you wounded? Did you travel a long way? Were you on a mission? Master got wounded? Fang Haishi, I didn't see you cook anything at all when it was me who got hurt. Apparently, you're only trying to make Master happy. In that case, don't drag me to the drill ground with you again. I'm eating it! Go away! Master! Master. Master, have some soup. There are sea cucumbers and ginseng in it which can nourish you. Just taste it. Master, how's your wound? Just a scratch. Master, Haishi woke up in the middle of the night to cook this soup in the kitchen. Yes. Look at it. It must taste as bad as it looks. It's a mess. Stop it! That said, Haishi did try his best to make it work. Please at least take a sip. Master, would you like a green bean cake? It helps cleanse your system. The vegetables are tasty, too. Have a bite. So? It's good. Zhuoying is off duty today. Let's see how well you've learned lately. Meaning I have to be Master, will I get a post at the Palace if I pass your test? So, how do you want to play? Shoot three arrows each. The one with more arrows on the target will win. Deal. Yes! Nice! Excellent! Young Master Haishi nailed it! Agreed. He's as good as Commander back in the day! You... You shot my arrow down! Yes. You didn't say I couldn't. Fine. Shoot again. Well done! Good job! He's good! Yes! Oops. I got yours again. - Master! Commander! Archery can be taught but integrity can't. Stop wasting time on beating others with tricks but practice hard to win fair and square. Master... You need more practice. Hey, who's the loser now? Master is telling you that you aren't qualified for the job yet. Haishi. Look. The kitchen baked walnut pancakes, with sesames. Everybody in Jifeng Pavilion smelled it. So no dinner? I have 212 more shots to practice. You're a fool to deny food. The arrows aren't going anywhere. But the pancakes are going into my belly bite by bite. The pancakes can't go anywhere either. I think, it's your belly that's growling. Zhuoying! Shaozi. Still practicing, Haishi? Do you have any Spirit Lifter? Give me some. I gave you some only a few days ago, didn't I? Shaozi. the Spirit Lifter does give you a lift, but don't eat it like it's some kind of candy. Alright? You think I don't know? You know, days ago, I took the new senior maid to the palace. From 11:00 PM tonight we change shifts every four hours. I'm sent to West Corner Gate. How could I slack off? You're so dedicated. I wouldn't be able to do that. I'll go get it for you. Haishi, remember to eat. Come on. Nobody except you dare climb over the palace wall to get in. I couldn't help to, Shaozi. There's a golden rain tree 16 meters west of East Corner Gate. Behind the tree is a blind spot the guards often neglect. Who wouldn't take the short cut? Be careful! Stop! I couldn't find you anywhere in Jifeng Pavilion. So I knew you had come here. You should feel lucky Master isn't here. If he found out you and I climbed over the palace wall, there would be a reprimand. I just feel so unfair. Look at those new guards in palace. None of them are better than me Why can they be guards and I can't? Haishi. Master has his reason to make such arrangement. What we need to do is to follow his orders. He doesn't allow you so just stay at home. I... I just want to look around. I'll go back at dawn. Without Master's permission, you can't. Come on! Haishi! You have to obey the rules. I will let you go tonight. If tomorrow, you come to the palace again without Master's permission, I will tell him about it. Besides, you'll do the homework for me Me again? Sure. Or shall I tell Master about tonight? No. Let's go. Let's take this way. In case Master asks in a while, we have to make up a story. Remember it. Alright. When we see Master, don't sell me out. In a while... Master. Master. It's late. Where have you been? - On the drill ground. Master, the truth is I was practicing on the drill ground, but Zhuoying made me I told him Master's doctrine is that to be an accomplished man, one has to maintain his integrity first, and then spares no efforts to learn. The desire for food and pleasure saps one's will the most. Right, Master. I shouldn't have taken Haishi out for fun at night. I'll make 200 copies of the house rules. I had the kitchen make fish soup. It's in your chamber. Your favorite, right? I'm so happy that you remember, Master. Go ahead. Yes. Master. I should go, too. It's late. Boring. Your Majesty. Judging by the time, water from Shuixin Palace's hot spring may have been delivered It is quite cold. Would you like a hot spring bath? A bath in daytime is untimely. It's cold indeed. I presume the cold has paralyzed your mind. Why not warm it up in the hot spring yourself? Oh... My mind isn't that important. It doesn't deserve the hot spring water If it's not Your Majesty's intention to take a hot bath, how about this? It'll be the Lantern Festival Shall I tell the servants to get prepared? So Your Majesty can make for riddle games. We can also build a lantern tower. What do you say, Your Majesty? The Lantern Festival. I grew up in the palace. All my brothers and sisters married It's not their choice. Such being the case, there's no reason I should worry. You ought to worry about yourself. If you lose the bet, my homework this month will be your responsibility. You'll be the one who loses. With Princess of Zhunian's presence at the lantern fair in question, even if she comes, it'll be like finding a needle in the haystack to find her. What's more, it's a rare chance that only exists in stories. You look just like a coarse martial man, without the slightest quality The chance is even rarer. Let's see. Skincare. Pervert! How dare you offend her ladyship? Do you know who the lady in front of you is? I know you. You're Zizan of Zhunian. How rude! I'm Zhongxu. ZHONG means the second and XU is the morning sun. You're from Zhunian and know little about Dazheng's characters. It doesn't matter. There are so many of them. I can teach you in the future. Master. I brought some ginseng soup from the kitchen to refresh your mind. Put it there. It's bustling on the streets, right? You don't have to stay here. Go with Zhuoying to the fair in a while. If you don't go, I don't go, either. I'll go to the kitchen and cook some Yuanxiao for you. It's the tradition to eat sesame stuffing Yuanxiao at the start so everything will go well in the year. Commander. Come in. Master. New task? Sort of. It must be the man in the palace who insists to go out. It's said the liegemen can choose to or not to serve a monarch. A monarch should devote his life and spare not a day to rest. In his case, it's the other way around. How dare you? Is this something you can comment? Get out now. Yes, Master. What is it? Commander, His Majesty has ordered not to deploy any troops. Why did you ask us to follow secretly? If His Majesty doesn't appreciate it, I'm worried about your friendship. His Majesty is the ruler of Dazheng, the heir of emperors. If it were you, would you choose friendship or your duty? I see. I've searched the streets of Tianqi City and deployed sentries. But the lantern fair is crowded. In case I miss something, I want to ask your order if we should follow you in secret. I'll be with His Majesty. We'll be fine in a short time. You can follow us. But don't get too close, in case His Majesty finds out. Understood. I should get going. Come and look! There's the one and only skincare product. Take a look, ladies. It's me, Zhuoying. Way to go, buddy. Aren't you reading in the study? What are you doing out here? I changed my mind. Nosy man. I have to be. Do you know? The Lantern Festival isn't just celebrated Today, lots of unmarried girls go out to date men. What's more, a girl and a man can exchange tokens of love. Everyone comes for the riddles in lanterns. I have to keep an eye on you. You're afraid I'll be cheated? No, I'm afraid you'll cheat somebody. Fang Zhuoying, if I'm right, you're on duty today. Well, Shaozi asked me to stand guard On the top floor of the restaurant, I can only see the crowds jostling one another, but nothing else. So I came out. You think I want to come to you? If your buddy here has a... Mister, look how exquisite it is. I'll buy a pair, so we both can have one. Good eye, Miss. The jade pendants are made of one piece of gem, which stands for union and being forever together. They're the best gifts for your beloved. I'll take them. Great! 2,000 coins. They're beautiful. Here. For you. No, thanks. You've been watching it. It's for lovers. I know. Why did you buy it then? There are too many bachelors in Jifeng Pavilion. Take me as an example. And you. And Master, too. We need to buy these love charms. Or Jifeng Pavilion should be renamed Bachelors' Hall. I don't know whom I can gift. Well, give it to Master then. Take a look over here! Favorable price! You can gift him it. It is His Majesty. The man by his side must be Fang Jianming. Pass the word. Tell everybody to gather here. Yes. It's a tradition in Dazheng that on Lantern Festival, everybody eats Yuanxiao. Why? By delighting your mouth with sweetness, you'll be safe and make a fortune in the coming year. Is it true? Let me get one for you. Here. I can eat it on my own. Have one. What's the stuffing? Taro. Taro! That's great. What's great about it? Look, taro and Yuanxiao are both round. The two together double the good omen. We're in a troubled time. I hope this year... No. I hope in the rest of our lives, we can live happily and peacefully like the omen Yuanxiao bears. Here's one for you. Delicious! I'm hungry. Sir, if you want to eat Yuanxiao, you can... So, you also want to control my life? Sir, two bowls of Yuanxiao. Sure! Too many eyes here. Please put the mask on, sir. How can I eat with that on? Take yours off. Your Yuanxiao! Please enjoy. I humbly ask you to eat faster. So we can leave here. Su Ming reported that the rebels had been eradicated. Are you still worried I'm not afraid. To fish big, you need a big bait. Don't you want my help to be a sure winner? Haishi, look. Fireworks. Check the dried fruits. Look. Have a piece. I want some of this. Pack some for me. Sure.
