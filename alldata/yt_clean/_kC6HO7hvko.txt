Well, opening! Of course we still have to clean up a bit... November 2013 (I started) - so in November it will be 10 years anniversary Can you help me? I don't know where to go. Look please... Yes, other side. Across the street, Brunowstrasse continues This way, right? Do I have to go through the traffic lights? Yes, you have to go through the traffic lights. To see that we we are open Morning! Work, yes? Normally seasoned? Bread roll? Thank you very much. Just a minute, then we have it. Has someone eaten on credit? Nope, he probably ate and forgot to pay. I didn't have it on my radar anymore either. But that's what's nice here in the neighborhood. If someone doesn't pay or forgets or chats too much, they'll come and pay the next day Well, what would you like to have? One Currywurst; I don't even know whether with or without sausage casings... I think you always take it with casing. I'm relatively sure. So, one menu - EUR 3, - please... thank you! Don't hold on the money! Well before it falls down. Thank you. Thanks. Yes, is that a good thing? [street noise] So, yes, you get your sausage, it's almost ready. A dash of mayo, yes!? Should I put something on the nuggets, a little curry sauce or something? Or would you rather have it plain? I think we always had nothing on it. Well, let's just leave it like that, okay? Mr Schonemann! Okay, nuggets. Bye! So, Currywurst fries, twice! Yes, come... Too late (whispering). Sometimes with mayo, sometimes with nothing. Exactly. Napkins? Yes. Did you want half a portion? Once ... and twice. Thank you very much! And don't let it fall! I'm trying hard. Sooo, Currywurst &amp; rolls? Yes indeed! Works, yes? Wonderful, enjoy it! Thank you very much A bit spicy, yes? Yes. That's EUR3 please, thank you! Well, what may I serve you? Currywurst. With fries. And mayo and ketchup Two...seven - all good, thank you very much! You can go to the table and I'll give it to you straight away. Yes, that's nice! Yes, that doesn't leave me unscathed either, you see? The tax office sent someone over! No, just joking, everything's fine - don't worry. Excellent thank you. And 75 (cents), the lady... Thank you! A white one. Enjoy it, okay? Where is he? Curry fries with "white". Well, this one is difficult. Max, those days are over. You now have to wait in line for at least half an hour! I'll continue to pay my EUR2.70, Torsten. Fine, but you have to wait in line. Plus champagne! Yes, exactly...not at all! If I become famous and they're lining up here, then I said yes...I'll raise prices! Maybe lowering them? Oh Max, are you crazy? Complete. [street noise] Currywurst dealer, me or that one. If we find you there too, we'll worry... So, he only wants to do it once, yes? Once. So I should only make Currywurst fries once, not twice!? As ordered. [street noise] The fries make a big difference, very tasty. Crispy. Juicy. The fries alone - it would be worth coming here. Mayo is also very tasty, there are also other mayonnaises But in any case the curry sauce is homemade and it is also very good! So overall it gets out of 5 stars from me... 5 stars. As simple as that! Quality pays off. I also live here in Tegel and am a child of Reinickendorf. And Tegel has spruced itself up a lot in the last 7, 8, 9 years, A lot has been invested here. If you look at the residential complexes that are being built here... So capital is coming here. And capital is hungry! EUR27.30. [sound of coins] Are you still doing the math, right? Nope, everything cool Of course you can do that. No, not in the trash can. Oh, yes, that's right - one was red/white. Look out, very good! Cutlery too? Yes, please. Can I include this in a thing, okay? You probably eat together. No no. No, don't you eat together? But you are welcome to do it together with me. Well, it's red and white here, you've seen that. And white. Thank you very much! You're welcome, goodbye! Yes please, go for it! You see, he does it with passion. Now a cheeseburger... a hamburger with cheese. As far as I'm concerned, as you like. [street noise] So, what would you like to have? For me now? Yes. I would like a currywurst, with a roll - but without casing, please, okay? Have a good meal! Are you still watching...? Okay [street noise] A little spicy? Exactly. So, you said red and white? Perfect thank you! Then it's EUR11.30. So that we don't end up with 4 tables tomorrow! Quitting time!!!
