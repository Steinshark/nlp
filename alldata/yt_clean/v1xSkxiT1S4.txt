- Get these guys out of bed. We've been living on site since TTC. Boys. Get out of bed, it's time to go mining! YouTube GOLD, baby, let's go. - [Rookie] I'm so hungover. - [SluiceBox Steve] Can I finish my beer? - Morning, boys. - [RCSparks] Time for YouTube GOLD! I see that Joe wasn't - No Joe. have to pick up where he's slacking off. But don't worry, I think I got a machine that might help us up production. - What's in the box? - [RCSparks] Well exactly, man. You know that we've been going for more gold than ever this season, and I figured why not spend and get ourselves a new machine, right? - Yeah. if you wanna go ahead. I should've given you a this will take a very long - Woo! - Watch your fingers. - It's orange. watch this styrofoam, I hate this stuff. It sticks to you like for years. - [Steve] It gets everywhere. - It's okay, it's not my place. (laughing) (vacuum whirring) - Move the box. - [RCSparks] Yeah, get the box out. Should've used the crane for that. - Should've. - Should've. - [RCSparks] Put it back in the box! (laughing) It's a small barrel, hey? - It is. but remember when Wyatt and I wanted to have You'll see here, or a Yes, it's a trailer. - We need to back load it here. - [RCSparks] For sure. Hello. (vacuum whirring) Steve, you should ask Get consent! (vacuum whirring) (wood creaking) - [Rookie] More styrofoam. - [Steve] Conveyors, more conveyors. - [RCSparks] People on It was more conveyors, kind of. - [Rookie] Some little gear head motors. - [Steve] They're short ones. - [Rookie] Yeah, tiny little guys. - [Steve] Perfect. - [RCSparks] So you'll see so these will be able to so it's completely a mobile set up. - [Rookie] That is wild. - [RCSparks] There's one on either side, so one will branch out on the front, one will branch out on the back. Okay so, on the RC model design page there is the white one so we can see cause there Real minors don't need - [Steve] Real minors would (laughing) So that's all folded up, hey? - [RCSparks] Yeah, exactly, so this way we can see how it's tied up, yep, so this is totally for mobile transport, and like Mike says, this one swings. Yeah, it's like the size of my finger. - [Rookie] That's wild. - [RCSparks] So conveyor underneath, that's styrofoam everywhere. - [Rookie] All leaf-sprung. - [RCSparks] All leaf-sprung, yep, heavy duty too, that's crazy. Good, cause we're gonna then we're gonna need something Oh yeah, how-- - [Rookie] So this'll sit, it'll keep the dirt in the center. - [RCSparks] Correct, instead - [Rookie] That is worth the hurt, man. It's beautiful, I like it a lot. - I don't wanna get the belt, but-- - [Rookie] Maintenance already? - [RCSparks] All of these are squeaky, well you're darn right, it's gonna go out in the field right away, I wanna make sure everything's-- - [Rookie] That's not gonna - It should dry, it should dry dry. - [Rookie] Should dry dry? - Dry dry? This is why you have a on staff at all times. - Hey tires are apprentice I have a license, I'm not - [RCSparks] But your name is Rookie, aren't you your own apprentice? - That's, yeah, fair enough. - [Steve] Well there's that swings the conveyor on - On the pin? On this pin here, yep. - [RCSparks] And it's run by a servo? - [Steve] It's run by a servo, yep. - [RCSparks] Just that - [Steve] It's pretty awkward - [RCSparks] Yikes, look at that. - [Steve] It is on a plug though. - [Rookie] Yeah, we'll have to take a-- - [RCSparks] It got ripped off. - [Rookie] and solder it back together. - [RCSparks] Always Well at least we get to see-- we noticed it now. - [RCSparks] Yeah, and under the plate here. It's obviously gonna, is it a direct? Yeah, direct, yeah. - [Rookie] Those are some gears. - [RCSparks] It's good - So there's actually four conveyors, plus the trommel on this, - [RCSparks] Yep, there is. So we can strip this down - Yeah, we got enough there to work with. - [RCSparks] Try to leave - [Rookie] That's a stubby - [RCSparks] I've never heard that before. No, like, I've never heard that before. (laughing) - So turns out that I Found out the whole time that, you know when I was at my mom's place the other day having - [RCSparks] So here goes the throttle, that controls the conveyor. Now I can run that backward or forward, and you'd be wondering to yourself, &quot;What, is he gonna stand there and the answer is yes, of course I would. Or I can just adjust my trim level to keep it on a constant forward to make the conveyors - We just need to assign - [RCSparks] That's right, There's the front swing arm. This is the entire length guys how long is this? - That's giant is what that is. - [RCSparks] That's all the time, by the way. (laughing) - [Rookie] These ones that are just sticking out ever so slightly. - [RCSparks] Perfect, and they So this is how it would be transported. There it is. That is amazing. (laughing) - That is weird. (truck whirring) - [Rookie] Oh that's so close. - That back axle is off the ground. - [Rookie] I see that, two of them. - Two of them, yeah. Whoa! - [Rookie] Who left that cord here? - Are you guys no help at all? Geez. - [Mikal] I'm waiting - [Rookie] He already did. (mumbles) - [RCSparks] Such an I handed it off to Rook there, he's a good pilot at this as well. So this is my Ford Tamiya, Tamiya, Tamiya, however It's got a Tekin ROC412 in it. Plenty of pulling power but hard to turn sharply. - [Rookie] She's doing pretty good so far. - [RCSparks] Yeah, very well. - [Rookie] Still worried about this hill. I know we're going the long way, but, - [RCSparks] You wanna try it? - [Rookie] man that's a lot of weight. - [RCSparks] I think you should - [Rookie] I think you're crazy. - [RCSparks] Okay. - [Rookie] I'm worried Let's find out. - [RCSparks] Beautiful, It's got all that weight planted on the back axles of the truck. Ooh, careful brother. - [Rookie] Ooh, that's tippy. - [RCSparks] Yeah Well done, Rook. Ooh, traction problem. (truck revving) Nice! All uphill. - [Rookie] Have we checked - No. there's a boulder in the way, somebody wanna deal with that? There's gotta be a more efficient way of-- - [RCSparks] Yeah, yeah. (truck whirring) Takes a long time to move 63 pounds. (truck whirring) - [Rookie] I'm already past that one. The big rock that's in my way. - [RCSparks] Come on, man, (truck whirring) Nice job Mike. All uphill, oh, there's way You gotta go, no, Rook, Rook, no. You're gonna get him stuck. (sighs) Let him clear a path. Nice flat path, Mike. Rook you're probably gonna let him take one more pass. - [Rookie] Give her all she's got. - Yeah. - Good job. - Thanks. - [RCSparks] He needs Yeah, ah. Okay, chain up. Just chain to the back of the dozer. Careful, that's a lot of weight. - [Rookie] All right, I'm done - [Rookie] Who's our chain up guy? - [RCSparks] That, no wait, wait, wait. Don't put that on the front of the bumper. That's not gonna work, that's gotta go straight - The axle? the bumper right off, you - No. You ever done any rigging before? - Yeah, a little. - [RCSparks] It said on your - That's what I said, a little rigging. (sighs) - [RCSparks] Maybe rigor mortis at your age brother, come on. - [Steve] I feel like it's setting in. - [Rookie] Probably just - [RCSparks] Coulda pulled it. Here, get out of the way, get outta there. Three guys to hook up one chain. - [Rookie] Well I feel I've been-- - [Steve] This is the hardest part. - [RCSparks] It's right - [Steve] There you go. - [RCSparks] Let's keep it short. - Connect to itself, yeah? Yep, right there. - You good? - In position? - Go, pull. You powering? More power, more power, don't be pulling that front axle out. - [Rookie] My tires are spinning. - [RCSparks] I see, yeah, you're gonna hit the rock, there it is. - [Rookie] Don't have a lot of steering going on right now. It's lifting, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - What happened? - [RCSparks] It's okay, we're Spin around, Mike, get - Every time the dozer's pulling me, I have zero steering, I have it's, I go where it goes, - [RCSparks] Okay Mike, shorter chain. Try to steer him around the rock. Good, are you going forward? - [Mikal] Going forward. Yeah, start turning Mike. - [Rookie] (mumbles) up ahead, dig it in. - [RCSparks] There it is, there it is. Nice job! Power down, Rook, start coming towards me. - [Rookie] I've got no steering, I'm just following a dozer. There we go! - You're clear now. - [RCSparks] Keep going, There, yeah, cause he's A little more, bring it right over here. You're good, you're good, let's unhook. - [Steve] Nicely done, guys. - [RCSparks] Yeah, well done. Okay, pumps in the water. Firing up the top pumps.

Bring your bucket lower. - [Steve] Trying to get - [RCSparks] Other way bro, - [Steve] I know, man. - [RCSparks] What's up with that? - [Rookie] If you wouldn't Sluice, you'd remember how to do it. - [RCSparks] That's a good point man, start coming by. holiday the whole year, what do you mean? (machine whirring) - [Steve] Is that the auger over there? - [RCSparks] No, we got a squeaking wheel. It's this one, we'll shut That's on the power box over there, Rook. Shut her down! That's all we ever say (laughing) - [RCSparks] Okay, the hoppers full. Let's start this up. Look at this, immediately those conveyors start moving that material, look how fast it starts Keep her going, bring her through. No matter what just keep Oh, I moved the, ah, That's cool though! (laughing) - [Rookie] Yeah that's - [RCSparks] Sorry I wasted the pay! Pay keeps coming, we keep processing. That's all we gotta do (machine whirring) - [Rookie] Come on Sluice, it's a high center of gravity. There you go. (machine whirring) - I'm trying not to put cause they end up going over - [RCSparks] So everyone back up the Volvo dump truck, right? - Yeah. right into the hopper, but, - Well most of it would - It would go over it, doesn't have enough chance to sift through. You could say bigger grizzly bars, but then you'd get all - [Steve] We gotta spoonfeed it. - [RCSparks] Round and screening everything that comes in. Straight down to the Spiker Cat. More and more pay keeps coming down. It's 30 degrees Celsius plus Hot on the prairie, I know everybody love the Volvo, but we got one of the ESCs down today, so we gotta swap them is a true beast, all hydraulic.

Watch out, if there's any, watch out, if there's any gold in Shut it, here, shut it down. Shut the pump right off. That's what happens, I was came right out off the joint. We should've glued it! - [Rookie] Shoulda glued it! - [RCSparks] What I like about this plant not running all the wasting any battery, we any charges for a recharge, like no actual financial expense. It just can basically sit there idle until that hopper is full. (machine whirring) These conveyors are moving A bug just crawled across This conveyor can hold much but it has to move can only process so much That's why we break it It's become quite the operation since episode one, hey Sluice? - [Steve] It's way huger now, man. (machine whirring) - [RCSparks] Okay boys, shut her down! Let's get this all What'd you just say? - [Steve] I can't believe the size of this (beep) nugget, man. - [RCSparks] Didn't hear ya. - [Steve] Said I can't believe you could make a necklace - [RCSparks] This one, yeah, nice!
