&gt;&gt; HERE WE GO. &gt;&gt; FIRINGS DOWNFIELD. &gt;&gt; OH, WHAT A PLAY! &gt;&gt; TOUCHDOWN, NEW ENGLAND! JIM: AND NEW ENGLAND WILL BE RECEIVING THE KICK. RAVENS-PATRIOTS, A.F.C. CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. BALTIMORE ACTUALLY WON THE TOSS AND DEFERRED, AS THEY DO EVERY TIME THEY WIN THE TOSS. IF YOU HEARD FROM STEVE, THE WEATHER IS GOING TO BE A FACTOR, SPECIFICALLY THE WIND GUSTS. PHIL: IT'S GOING TO AFFECT THE THROWS AND THE KICKING GAME BUT IT COULD CHANGE WHAT THE COACHES DO. HOW THEY MANAGE THE GAME AND WHETHER OR NOT TO GO FOR A LONG FIELD GOAL. JIM: OF COURSE, YOU HAVE TWO OF THE STRONGEST ARMED QUARTERBACKS IN THE GAME HERE. AND ALREADY THE BALL HAS COME OFF THE TEE FOR THE ROOKIE KICKER TUCKER, WHO BOOTED THEM PAST DENVER LAST WEEK. HE'S HAD THREE GAME-WINNING KICKS IN A REMARKABLE ROOKIE SEASON. YOUNG MAN OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS. ONE OF THE WINS WAS BACK SEPTEMBER 23 WHEN HE HIT THE WINNER WITH NO TIME LEFT AGAINST NEW ENGLAND. 31-30 BALTIMORE VICTORY. MCCOURTY IS BACK DEEP ALONG WITH SLATER. THEY HAVE TWO DEEP. AND WE'RE UNDERWAY FOR THE A.F.C. CHAMPIONSHIP. AND THIS BALL IS GOING ALMOST INTO THE STANDS. THAT WAS DOWNWIND, SO BRADY GOES INTO THE WIND AGAINST THERE BALTIMORE BUNCH. HIS SEVENTH APPEARANCE EVER IN THE A.F.C. CHAMPIONSHIP GAME, TRYING TO BECOME THE FIRST QUARTERBACK TO EVER START IN SIX SUPER BOWLS, IF HE CAN GET PAST BALTIMORE TODAY. HERE'S HIS LINE. SOLDER ON THE LEFT SIDE. SHOULD SEE A LOT OF SUGGS TODAY. AND HERNANDEZ WILL BE THE TIGHT END WITH PLENTY OF ACTION, YOU HAVE TO THINK. GRONKOWSKI REINJURING FOREARM LAST WEEK AND DONE FOR THE SEASON IS. RIDLEY FOR ABOUT FIVE. KRUGER SLAMS HIM DOWN AS WELL AS NGATA. NOW, THIS BALTIMORE DEFENSE HAS CERTAINLY GOTTEN STRONGER COME PLAYOFF TIME. THERE'S NGATA, AS THE PATRIOTS HURRY TO THE LINE. LEWIS AND SUGGESTS, BOTH BATTLING INJURIES TO GET BACK ONTO THE FIELD COME PLAYOFF TIME. BRADY ON SECOND DOWN FINDS HERNANDEZ FOR THE FIRST AND A PICKUP OF 10, RAHN YOU KNOW -- RUNNING AWAY FROM ELLERBE. PHIL: YOU HEARD SOLOMON WILCOTS TALK ABOUT IT EARLY IN THE PREGAME THAT THE HURRY-UP OFFENSE. CAN YOU LINE YOUR DEFENSE UP, GET IN POSITION AND RECOGNIZE THE FORMATION? JIM: FIRST AND 10. AND AGAIN, FIRST-DOWN RUNNING PLAY FOR RIDLEY. THEY GIVE HIM THREE, SO BRADY AND THE PATRIOTS SHOWING THAT NO-HUDDLE EARLY. SOMETHING BALTIMORE FELT VERY COMFORTABLE WITH GOING INTO THIS GAME. PHIL: EVERYBODY FEELS COMFORTABLE WITH IT BUT WHEN YOU SEE IT IN PERSON, THE SPEED OF IT, YOU CAN'T DUPLICATE IT IN PRACTICE. BUT THE RAVENS DON'T DO A LOT ON DEFENSE. THEY CAN STAND THERE AND WAIT. RAY LEWIS SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THEM INTO THE RIGHT DEFENSE. JIM: SECOND AND 7, RUNNING PLAY. BACK TO RIDLEY AND RIDLEY IS CAUGHT BY THE NECK BY ELLERBE. PICKS UP FIVE. PHIL: ONE OF THE BIG DIFFERENCES, WHEN YOU SEE THIS HURRY-UP OFFENSE AGAINST SO MANY DEFENSES, THE PLAYERS ARE ALWAYS LOOKING TO THE SIDELINE, COACH, WHAT SHOULD WE CALL? THAT SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM FOR THE RAVENS BECAUSE RAY LEWIS CAN MAKE THE CALL AND SO CAN ED REED. JIM: THIRD AND 2 FOR THE PATRIOTS. BRADY TO THROW. GOES DOWN THE FIELD FOR WELKER. STRETCHED IT OUT, COULDN'T QUITE GET IT. HE GOT PAST COREY GRAHAM. HE HAD A STEP ON GRAHAM. PHIL: HE SURE DID. BRADY WAS LOOKING TO THROW SHORT TO THE COSSER -- CROSSER HERNANDEZ. GREAT PROTECTION. GOOD JOB OF STEPPING UP AND ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE FIELD AGAINST COREY GRAHAM. GRAHAM WAS EXPECTEDING THE FOOTBALL TO BE THROWN QUICK. IT'S NOT. WELKER RUNS THROUGH THE COVERAGE BUT THE WIND MADE THE FOOTBALL JUST OFF THE TARGET. JIM: RYAN MALLETT, NUMBER 18 IS THE UPBACK. MALLETT, THE BACKUP QUARTERBACK COMES UNDER CENTER. IT'S USUALLY PATRICK CHUNG ON THE PUNT TEAM AND THIS FORCES THE RAVENS TO CALL A TIME-OUT. JIM: AND THE PATRIOTS ARE BACK IN TRADITIONAL PUNT FORMATION AND CHUNG IS BACK. THEY HAVE NOT RUN A SUCCESSFUL FAKE PUNT, THE PATRIOTS, SINCE 199 . MESKO HAD A BIG GAME LAST WEEK AGAINST HOUSTON. DRIVES BACK JACOBY JONES. WHO MAKES THE FAIR CATCH AT THE 13. 45-YARD PUNT. PHIL: LET'S GO BACK TO THAT FOURTH DOWN. RYAN MALLETT, THE BACKUP QUARTERBACK, NUMBER 15 COMES INTO THE GAME AND IT CATCHES THE RAVENS BY SURPRISE. WERE THEY TO RUN A PLAY IN THIS SITUATION? I DON'T THINK SO. IT WAS A LITTLE TOO FAR TO RUN AN OFF TACKLE BUT THEY GOT TO SEE HOW THE RAVENS LINED UP IN CASE THEY DO WANT TO RUN SOMETHING LIKE THAT LATER IN THE GAME BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, THEY GOT THE RAVENS TO USE A TIME-OUT. JIM: THAT FORCES THE PUNT AND NOW FLACCO AND THE BALD OFFENSE WITH RAY RICE TAKING OFF THE RIGHT SIDE FOR A COUPLE. INTO THE ARMS OF BRANDON SPIKES. FLACCO HAD A HUGE GAME HERE IN THE TITLE GAME LAST YEAR HERE. OVER 300 AND A COUPLE OF TOUCHDOWNS THEN THREW FOR 382 BACK IN SEPTEMBER AGAINST NEW ENGLAND AND THREE MORE SCORES. MATT BIRK, THE 15-YEAR MAN OUT OF HARVARD, THE CENTER. POSSIBLE RETIREMENT AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. BUT A LONG-TIME BIG CONTRIBUTOR, AND SMITH HAD NO TOUCHDOWNS AGAINST NEW ENGLAND IN THAT WEEK-THREE MATCHUP. SECOND AND 8 AND RICE AGAIN. AND ONCE MORE SPIKES HAS THE TACKLE. GIVE HIM THREE MORE. THIRD AND 5 ON THE WAY. PHIL: A LOT OF STORIES TO LOOK AT THIS THIS GAME. ONE, THE OFFENSIVE LINE FOR THE RAVENS. THEY CHANGED IT UP FOR THE FIRST PLAYOFF GAME TWO WEEKS AGO AGAINST THE COLTS AND THEY HAVE PLAYED VERY WELL THE LAST TWO WEEKS. JIM: IT'S WORKED WELL WITH MCKINNIE AT LEFT TACKLE AND OHER SHIFTING TO THE RIGHT SIDE. THIRD AND WE'LL CALL IT 4. FLACCO THROWS IT OVER AND IT WAS GOING TO BE DEFENDED ANYWAY . HAS TO MAKE THE APPEAL FOR A BACKWARDS PASS. NO CHANCE. PHIL: EVEN IF IT'S COMPLETED THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO. THAT SHOWS YOU SOMETHING. EVEN ON LITTLE SWING PASSES, BECAUSE OF THE BREEZE YOU HAVE TO BE SHORT AND CRISP. JIM: SAM KOCH IN TO PUNT. HAD BOTH HIS REGULAR SEASON GROSS AND NET AVERAGE CAREER BESTS. DIDN'T CATCH THIS ONE. DOWNWIND. GETS A GENEROUS HOP, THE FLAG IS OUT. THAT'S WELKER RUNNING IT AND REED COMES BACK TO KNOCK HIM DOWN AT THE 4 -- 44. BILL LEAVY IS TODAY'S REFEREE. THAT WAS A 51-YARD PUNT. YOU SAW ALBERT MCCLELLAN AND REFEREE: DURING THE RETURN, HOLDING, NUMBER 25, RECEIVING TEAM. THE PENALTY IS DECLINED. HOLDING, NUMBER 31 OF THE SHEAVING TEAM. THAT PENALTY WILL BE ACCEPTED. 10 YARDS FROM THE END OF THE KICK. FIRST DOWN, TIME-OUT. JIM: CLUNG AND JIM: WITH THE HOLDING PENT ON THE SPECIAL TEAMS, NEW ENGLAND, SENDS THEM BACK TO THE 21 FOR THEIR SECOND SERIES. FAKE TO RIDLEY THIS TIME AND THE PASS TO LLOYD. MAKES A NICE DIVING CATCH AT THE 29. AND GAINS EIGHT. LLOYD, WHO HAD NINE CATCHES IN THE FIRST MATCHUP WITH BALTIMORE. WAS OVER 100 YARDS. PHIL: BRANDON LLOYD PLAYS, I THINK, A TOUGH POSITION ON THIS FOOTBALL TEAM. WITH THE TIGHT ENDS AND WES WELKER, WHERE DO YOU FIT IN? GOOD TO GET HIM INVOLVED EARLY. JIM: RIDLEY TRIPPED UP AND FALLS TO THE FIRST. ENOUGH TO MOVE THE CHAINS. PHIL: YOU TALK ABOUT THIS BALTIMORE DEFENSE. JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS. THEY DON'T MOVE AROUND A LOT LIKE SOME TEAMS DO AGAINST THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CHASE A TIGHT END OUTSIDE OR A RUNNING BACK. BUT STAY WANT TO MAKE TOM BRADY THROW THE FOOTBALL DOWN THE FIELD AND OUTSIDE. TRY TO TAKE AWAY ALL THOSE SHORT PASSES OVER THE MIDDLE. JIM: BRADY FIRES IT TO HERNANDEZ. HE WIGGLES PAST POLLARD AND PICKS UP ANOTHER EIGHT. LAST WEEK NEW ENGLAND OPENED THE GAME WITH DANNY WOODHEAD, WHO GOT INJURED EARLY. AND HERE'S HERNANDEZ. PHIL: GOOD COVERAGE. ANOTHER PASS TO THE INSIDE. IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THEORY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO STOP IT BUT THEY'RE SO GOOD AT IT. WHEN YOU THROW SHORT PASSES OVER THE MIDDLE, DEFENSIVE LINEMEN CAN TIP IT. DEFENDERS CAN GET IT. THE PATRIOTS HAVE MASTERED IT. JIM: BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE AND WELKER TRIED TO COME BACK FOR IT. DON'T MISS CBS SPORTS ONLINE SCREENING OF THE SUPER BOWL WITH NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN CAMERA ANGLES AND IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE COMMERCIALS. GET IT ALL, CBSSPORTS.COM/SUPER BOWL. PHIL: THERE WAS THAT GUY THAT YOU SAY HIS NAME A LOT FOR THE RAVENS. PAUL CUING -- KRUGER. HE STOPPED A SCREEN PLAY TO THE OUTSIDE BY WES WELKER. JIM: NOW WOODHEAD COMES IN ON THIRD AND 2. SECOND TIME NOW THEY'VE FACED THIRD AND 2 FROM VIRTUALLY THE SAME POINT ON THE FIELD. BRADY. A JARRING HIT BUT HOLDING ON IS LLOYD! HE WAS ROCKED BY ED REED BUT ABLE TO WRAP IT UP FOR 14 YARDS AND A FIRST. PHIL: WATCH THE RECEIVERS CROSSING IN THE MIDDLE. THEY'RE BOTH COVERED WELL SO TOM BRADY KNOWS IF YOU COVER THE CROSSERS THE IN CUT BEHIND, A STIPLE OF THEIR OFFENSE -- SAME OF THEIR OFFENSE. AND AN EXCELLENT THROW BY BRADY. JIM: HERNANDEZ IN THE BACKFIELD, RAZZ IS WOODHEAD. BRADY DOWN THELINE AND THAT'S COVERED. THAT WAS CARY WILLIAMS STAYING RIGHT WITH HIM. PHIL: A GOOD JOB. WHEN YOU SEE AARON HERNANDEZ IN THE BACKFIELD. YOU KNOW HE'S NOT BACK THERE TO BE BRADY'S PERSONAL PROTECTOR. WHEN THEY PUT WELKER, ANY OF THOSE GUYS IN THE BACKFIELD, LOOK OUT. THEY TOOK AWAY THE SHORT PLAYS. DANNELL ELLERBE, WHO ALONG WITH RAY LEWIS, THEY WERE SPECTACULAR LAST WEEK AGAINST THE DENVER BRONCOS. JIM: SECOND AND 10. BACK TO HERNANDEZ. ABLE TO SLIP THROUGH THE FIRST TACKLE AND NEAR ANOTHER FIRST. PHIL: WELL, WHEN YOU GET SKILL PLAYERS, GET THEM OUT IN SPACE, YOU GET THEM GOING, YOU SEND WES WELKER IN MOTION, THE DEFENSE DOESN'T REACT QUICK ENOUGH AND HOW ABOUT A JOB BY AARON SNERNLEDS THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A GOOD SCREEN THROWER IN THE NFL FOR A QUARTERBACK. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE ANGLES ON YOUR ARM. JIM: HERNANDEZ GAINED 11. FIRST DOWN FROM THE 37 AND RIDLEY. ABLE TO PICK UP JUST A YARD OUT OF THAT. SUGGS CREDITED WITH THAT TACKLE. PHIL: THE PATRIOTS' OFFENSE, THEY MAKE YOU THINK SO MUCH AND THAT'S THE BIG P THEY'RE GOING TO BEAT YOU PHYSICALLY BUT TRY TO BEAT YOU MENTALLY TOO. JIM: SECOND AND 9 AND DOWN TO THE 20 WITH BRANDON LLOYD AND 16 MORE. PHIL: NICE PLAY-ACTION FAKE. THEY LOVE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL IN THE HURRY-UPS AND NOW YOU KNOW THE DEFENSE YOU SEE YOU'RE GOING TO GET ONE-ON-ONE COVERAGE OUTSIDE. THEY WEREN'T READY. JIM: RIDLEY. INTO THE ARMS OF KRUGER. GIVE HIM TWO. RIDLEY HAD A BIG SECOND HALF AGAINST THE HOUSTON TEXANS LAST WEEK BUT REALLY HE WAS THE THIRD BACK INTO THAT GAME AFTER WOODHEAD AND AFTER SHANE VEREEN HAD A MONSTER GAME WITH TWO TOUCHDOWNS. SECOND AND 8. THEY GO END AROUND WITH HERNANDEZ. WELL, ERE STICKS A BLOCK ON LLOYD AND HERNANDEZ IS DOWN AT THE 12. REEMED AND GRAHAM FINISHED IT OFF AFTER A GAIN OF SIX. PHIL: THE PACE OF PLAY. WE NEVER TALK ABOUT IT. YOU RUN A HURRY-UP OFFENSE, THINK HOW HARD IT IS ON THE OFFENSIVE LINEMEN. NO FAT GUYS ON THAT OFFENSIVE LINE. JIM: THIS TIME LLOYD TRIMMED UP RIGHT AWAY BY COREY GRAHAM. PHIL: THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT JOB. THEY CRASHED THE MIDDLE THAT TIME FROM THE OUTSIDE. THE RAVENS THINK THEY HAVE ALL THE KEYS TO THAT HURRY-UP OFFENSE BY TOM BRADY. THEY SAY WE KNOW ALL THE CODE WORDS, WE KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN. JIM: THAT WAS A BIG THIRD-DOWN STOP BY COREY GRAHAM. SO OUT COMES GOSTKOWSKI. PHIL: GRAHAM, EXCELLENT BLITZER FROM THE OUTSIDE. JIM: 31 YARDS. MESKO ON THE HOLD AND GOSTKOWSKI BOOTS IT THROUGH AND NEW ENGLAND IS FIRST ON THE BOARD HERE. 32 ST CBSSPORTS.COM SLASH PEPSI FOR A CHANCE TO BE SEEN BY MILLIONS. THAT WAS 13 PLAYS AND A LITTLE OVER FIVE MINUTES. WE'VE BARELY SEEN THE BALTIMORE OFFENSE OUT HERE TO THIS POINT.

A FLAG IS OUT. REFEREE: DURING THE RETURN, ILLEGAL BLOCK IN THE BACK, NUMBER 56 OF THE RECEIVING TEAM. FIRST DOWN. JIM: THE RAVENS WILL START &gt;&gt; THE NFL ON CBS IS SPONSORED BY -- JIM: PATRIOT OWNER ROBERT KRAFT TAILGATING BEFORE THE GAME. JOINED TODAY TO HIS RIGHT BY LESLIE MOONVES, THE PRESIDENT AND C.E.O. OF CBS AND YOU CIRCLED THE GRONK SITTING BEHIND THE OWNER. FIRST AND 10 FOR BALTIMORE AND IT'S VONTA LEACH. BALTIMORE HAS ITS FIRST FIRST DOWN AS LEACH TAKES IT OUT TO THE 27. FAVRE THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED. JIM CALDWELL, THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR NOW FOR THE RAVENS, YOU NEED TO GET A DRIVE STARTED OUT THERE. AND ONE WEAKNESS YOU SEE IN THE PATRIOTS' DEFENSE, THEY WILL COVER PEOPLE DOWN THE FIELD AND LET THE BACKS AND TINLEDSE GO DOWN THE FLAT AND BE WIDE OPEN. JIM: TANDON DOSS IS IN THE GAME. AND RICE. INTO THE REGARDLESS OF JUSTIN FRANCIS. THIS NEW ENGLAND DEFENSE IN THE FIRST MEETING GAVE UP 503 YARDS. THAT'S THE MOST ANY OPPONENT HAD AGAINST THE NEW ENGLAND DEFENSE. NINKOVICH, FIVE FORCED FUMBLES ON THE YEAR, THE TOP TACKLER. ALSO WITH THAT FIRST MATCHUP, THEY NEVER SACKED FLACCO ONE TIME. SECOND AND 8. AND HE'S GOING FOR THE DEEP BALL AND TALIB WAS THERE WITH THE COVERAGE ON BOLDIN. -- BOLD EN. AND THAT'S A MATCH-UP TO WATCH TODAY. PHIL: THROWING IT DEEP DOWN THE FIELD. WE TALKED TO HA KEEP TALIB AND ALL HE KEPT SAYING WAS STAY ON TOP. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR A DEFENSIVE BACK? DON'T LET THEM GET BEHIND YOU. PLAY IT SAFE. MAKE HIM THROW IT SHORT AND TO THE OUTSIDE BUT NOT LONG DOWN THE FIELD. JIM: IT IS A BIG-PLAY OFFENSE, AS EVIDENCED LAST WEEK. THE AMAZING PASS TO JONES AND THE TWO TOUCHDOWN THROWS TO TORREY SMITH. THIRD AND 8. REFEREE: FALSE START, NUMBER 27, OFFENSE. FIVE-YARD PENALTY. THIRD DOWN. JIM: THAT WILL MAKE IT THIRD AND 13. PHIL: RAY RICE KEPT THEM IN THEIR STANCE AS LITTLE LONG. HE SAW THOSE OFFENSIVE LINEMEN ALL MAKING SIGNALS AND SOMETIMES IT EVEN GETS ME. I THINK THAT'S A FALSE START AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT MADE HIM MOVE. JIM: NEED TO GET TO THE 37 FOR A FIRST. FLACCO GOES UNDERNEATH AND IT'S KNOCKED DOWN BY TALIB! AGAIN, HE WAS MANNED UP ON ANQUAN BOLDIN AND TALIB MAKES THE PLAY. PHIL: THAT'S THE MATCHUP. COMING ACROSS THE FIELD, TALIB DOES START LIMPING AFTER THIS PLAY. A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT MAYBE HE WOULD COVER TORREY SMITH. NO, PUT THE BIG DEFENDER ON THE BIG RECEIVER AND DENARD, SMALL, QUICK GUY ON TORREY SMITH. JIM: HE GRABBED HIS RIGHT HAMSTRING AS HE HOPPED TO THE SIDELINE AND HERE'S KOCH FOR THE SECOND TIME AND IT'S A GOOD ONE, DRIVING WELKER TO THE 20. AND WELKER WITH A RUNBACK BEFORE HE SOMERSAULTS OUT OF BOUNDS. JIM: AQIB TALIB HEADS TO THE NEW ENGLAND LOCKER ROOM AFTER DEFENDING THAT LAST PASS PLAY. IT LOOKED LIKE HE TWEAKED A HAMSTRING. FIRST DOWN FOR THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS, FROM THE 33. AND IT'S SHANE VEREEN. THERE HE IS FOR THE FIRST TIME. HE PICKS UP SEVEN AND, AS TOM BRADY SAID, IT WAS A HUGE MOMENT FOR HIM, TALKING ABOUT SHANE VEREEN LAST WEEK AGAINST HOUSTON. PHIL: WOODHEAD WENT DOWN WITH A THUMB INJURY. VEREEN COMES IN, SCORED THREE TOUCHDOWNS. JIM: TRIED TO GET OUTSIDE BUT NGATA WOULD NOT ALLOW IT. HOLDS HIM TO ONE. PHIL: YOU LOOK AT THIS BALTIMORE DEFENSE, THEY'VE PLAYED 87 PLAYS THE LAST TWO WEEKS. THEY JUST WERE ON THE FIELD FOR A 13-PLAY DRIVE. WILL THEY WEAR OUT? WHAT DID RAY LEWIS SAY WHEN WE ASKED HIM THAT QUESTION? JIM: HE SAID THAT ONLY PREPARES US FOR TOM BRADY. PHIL: THAT'S RIGHT, HE SAID THE MORE PLAYS WE'RE OUT THERE WE GET IN A GROOVE AND THIS IS -- THERE IS SOMETHING TO THAT. JIM: WOODHEAD OFFSET TO BRADY'S LEFT. BRADY'S PASS IN TRAFFIC BUT CAUGHT. THERE IS A FLAG DOWN. HERNANDEZ SOMEHOW CAUGHT IT. REFEREE: PERSONAL FOUL, UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS, NUMBER 52 ON THE DEFENSE. JIM: CALL ON LEWIS. REFEREE: 15-YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN. PHIL: IT LOOKS LIKE JIMMY SMITH MISSES THE FOOTBALL TO GET THE INTERCEPTION, THEN RAY LEWIS COMES IN ATTACKING THE PLAY, LOWERS HIS SHOULDER AND -- JIM: IT'S RIGHT ON THE CROWN. CROWN TO CROWN. PHIL: IT IS. AND THEY'RE SAYING AARON HERNANDEZ DID NOT HAVE TIME TO PROTECT HIMSELF AND HE DOESN'T. TWO FEET ON THE GROUND. NO TIME ELAPSES. THAT'S WHY IT'S A PERSONAL FOUL. JIM: YOU'RE RIGHT THAT BALL DID LOOK LIKE IT HAD A BIG CHANCE TO BE PICKED. THE FAKE, THE THROW. AND INCOMPLETE. KRUGER WAS REACHING UP FOR IT AND THAT'S WHY BRADY HAD TO THROW IT SO HIGH. PHIL: TWICE THEY'VE RUN THESE MISDIRECTIONS AND THROWBACKS TO THE OTHER SIDE. TOM BRADY AGAIN HIT. MAKES HIM THROW IT QUICKER THAN HE WANTS BY ARTHUR JONES AND KRUGER JUMPING UP IN THE AIR. JIM: YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT ALL THOSE PLAYS, 87 THE LAST TWO WEEKS. ONLY TWICE IN NFL POSTSEASON SEASON HAS A TEAM WON A GAME WHEN AN OPPONENT RAN 87 PLAYS IN EACH OF THE LAST TWO WEEKS, AS POLLARD DRAGS DOWN VEREEN AND A GAIN OF TWO. TONIGHT AFTER THE GAME, DON'T MISS A SPECIAL NEW EPISODE OF &quot;HAWAII FIVE-O&quot; TONIGHT, ONLY CBS. THEY'RE GOING INTO THE WIND IN THIS FIRST QUARTER AND ALREADY THE PATRIOTS HAVE 107 YARDS OF OFFENSE. PHIL: I SAW THEM PRACTICE IT ON FRIDAY. THEY WERE GOING THROUGH THESE SITUATIONS KNOWING IT WAS GOING TO BE WINDY ON SUNDAY. TWO-DOWN TERRITORY, DON'T TAKE A SACK. JIM: THIRD DOWN FROM THE 35 AND INCOMPLETE THIS TIME, AS LLOYD DOVE FOR IT. PHIL: LET'S SEE WHAT THEY DO. THERE'S HESITATION ON THE SIDELINE. SCOTTIE O'BRIEN, THE SPECIAL TEAMS COACH. THEY SEND OUT THE KICKING UNIT. JIM: AND THEY BRING OUT MESKO. TOO LONG FOR A 53-YARD FIELD GOAL IN THESE GUSTY CONDITIONS. PHIL: YOU SAW IT UP HERE LAST WEEK IN THE PLAYOFF GAME, WHAT THE WIND CAN DO. JIM: ED REED IS BACK STANDING AT THE 10. HE UNWISELY FIELDED A PUNT LAST WEEK AT THE 6 IN OVERTIME. AND HE MAKES THE FAIR CATCH AT THE 7 ON THIS OCCASION. 27-YARD PUNT. MESKO GETS IT DONE. PENS HIM AT THE 7. NEXT SUNDAY, KICKOFF SUPER BOWL WEEK WITH THE NFL PRO BOWL, PRESENTED BY MCDONALD'S. FOR MORE INFORMATION, VISIT NFL.COM/PRO BOWL. PHIL: GREAT START FOR THE BALTIMORE DEFENSE, WOULDN'T YOU SAY SO, GOING AGAINST THIS OFFENSE? ESPECIALLY IN THIS STADIUM AND IN THIS WEATHER. HOLDING THEM TO THREE POINTS. JIM: MEANWHILE THE RAVENS' OFFENSE NOW WITH ITS THIRD DRIVE. IT STARTED FROM THE 13, THE 10, AND NOW THE 8. TERRIBLE FIELD POSITION. PIERCE GETTING THEM OUT OF THAT JAM AS HE RACES UP TO THE 20. PICKUP OF 11. PHIL: ONCE AGAIN A NAME YOU HAVEN'T SAID SO FAR TODAY, VINCE WILFORK. AND THE PATRIOTS DO A GOOD JOB OF MOVING ALL AROUND THE DEFENSIVE LINE SO HE CAN'T BE DOUBLE-TEAMED. JIM: FIRST DOWN. BACK TO PIERCE AGAIN. AND TRYING TO GET THROUGH A TINY CREASE, PICKS UP THREE. HE'S BEEN AN X FACTOR THIS LAST MONTH FOR THE RAVENS. RUSHED FOR OVER 100 AGAINST THE COLTS IN THE WILD CARD GAME. HAD 123 AGAINST THE GIANTS IN WEEK 16. PHIL: THE RUNNING BACKS COACH SAYS PEOPLE UNDERESTIMATE HIS POWER AND SPEED SPEED. JIM: SECOND AND 7. THE FAKE, FRANCIS TURNED AROUND AND INCOMPLETE, AS FLACCO WAS TRYING TO HIT ED DICKSON. PHIL: A LITTLE MISDIRECTION BY THIS OFFENSE. MOVE THE QUARTERBACK AROUND. THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO SO THE DEFENSE JUST CAN'T ZERO IN AND PUSH THE POCKET AND GET ON HIM IN PASSING SITUATIONS. THAT'S A PLAY YOU THINK THAT ED DICKSON SHOULD MAKE, THOUGH. JIM: HE HAD A GIMME IF HE WANTED TO GO WITH THE SHORT MAN, PITTA. FLACCO IS 1-5 HERE IN THE FIRST QUARTER. TALIB IS OUT, BY THE WAY. ARRINGTON IN FOR HIM. ON THIRD AND 7 AND FLACCO LOBS IT AND PITTA CAN'T QUITE GET TO IT. PHIL: THEY HAD WHAT THEY WANTED. THEY HAD PITTA AGAINST GREGORY, THE SAFETY AND IT'S A LITTLE MOVE OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. JUST GOES RIGHT UP THE SIDELINE AND YOU SEE GREGORY IS COMING IN TO PLAY THE SHORT ROUTE. THAT'S WHY PITTA GETS WIDE OPEN DOWN THE FIELD. AND THE WIND, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A FACTOR. DON'T THROW IT SOFT. THROW IT ON A LINE SO YOU CAN BE MORE ACCURATE WITH THE FOOTBALL. JIM: THREE DRIVES AND THREE PUNTS. KOCH. WELKER RETREATING TO THE 19. HAS HAHN ALI. STILL GOING -- HAS AN ALLEY. TRIPPED UP AMOUNT THE 45. JUST BEAFRL GETTING TO HIM WAS MCCLELLAN. 59-YARD BOOT. 28-YARD RETURN. MCCLELLAN RIGHT THERE MAY HAVE SAVED SOMETHING BIG. PHIL: MAKES IT TOUGH, I THINK, ON THE PUNT COVERAGE TEAM. BOY, THAT WAS A NICE MOVE BY WELKER, THAT LITTLE REDIRECT THROUGH THE HOLE. COVERAGE OFF BALANCE. BUT WHEN YOU PUNT IT RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD AND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S FAR, NOW THERE'S A TWO-WAY GOAL FOR THAT PUNT RETURNER. JIM: OF COURSE, LAST WEEK, TRINDON HALLIDAY EXPOSED THE SPECIAL TEAMS OF THE RAVENS ON TWO OCCASIONS. ONE PUNT, ONE KICK RETURN. AS BRADY, LOOK AT THAT BLOCK. BRADY JUST GETS IT AWAY IN TIME. PHIL: IT'S GOING TO BE 15. GROUNDING THE FOOTBALL. REFEREE: INTENTIONAL GROUNDING. THE BALL GOT BACK TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. JIM: YEAH, THE BALL WENT A COUPLE OF YARDS PAST THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. PHIL: THE FACT THAT HE WAS OUT OF THE POCKET AND HE DID GET IT PAST THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. JIM: THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE IS THE 47. AND THE BALL LANDS MAYBE AT THE 48, 49. SO THEY PICK UP THE FLAG. SECOND AND 10. HERNANDEZ TURNS AROUND, TURNS IT UPFIELD AND BACK ON THE BALTIMORE SIDE OF THE FIELD. GAIN OF EIGHT. TOMORROW ON CBS, GO FOR BROKE. IT'S A NEW EPISODE OF &quot;2 BROKE GIRLS&quot; YOU WON'T WANT TO MISS, TOMORROW ON CBS, AMERICA'S NUMBER ONE NETWORK. PHIL: A GOOD EXAMPLE THAT LAST PLAY. THROW IT SHORT. ALL OF THESE GUYS HAVE CAUGHT SO MANY PASSES, THE RECEIVERS. THEY CAN CATCH IT AND TURN UP THE FIELD AND GET THAT TWO OR THREE EXTRA YARDS. JIM: THIRD AND 2. AND BATTED AWAY AND ALMOST INTO THE HANDS OF KRUGER! THAT WAS CARY WILLIAMS WHO DEFLECTED IT. AND THEN KRUGER ON THE REBOUND ALMOST HAD THE PICK. PHIL: CARY WILLIAMS, LOOK TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN. HE IS NOT AFRAID TO GET IN AND COMPETE. OH, MY GOSH, I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WENT THAT FAR UNTIL I SAW THE REPLAY, BUT THAT WAS A CLEAN DEFENSE, A DEAFENED PASS BY CARY WILLIAMS. JIM: KNOCKING IT AWAY FROM BRANDON LLOYD. THAT REBOUNDED AS FAR AS JAKE TATUM TO FUQUA. AGAIN, MESKO, HAS NEW ENGLAND CONTINUES TO CONTROL THIS LITTLE CHESS MATCH OF FIELD POSITION. FAIR CATCH BY REED AT THE 10. 35-YARD BOOT. LET'S GO DOWN TO STEVE TASKER. STEVE: WELL, HAKEM TALIB WENT INTO THE LOCKER ROOM WITH A THIGH INJURY. HIS RETURN IS QUESTIONABLE. THE MEDICAL ATTENDANT WITH HIM, THE DOCTOR, DID COME OUT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEY WENT IN BUT TALIB REMAINS IN THE LOCKER ROOM. HIS RETURN IS QUESTIONABLE WITH A THIGH INJURY. JIM: THANK YOU, STEVE. THAT'S BIG. STEVE: IT IS BECAUSE THEY HAD HIM MATCHED UP AGAINST ANQUAN BOLDIN. PHIL: NOW THEY'RE THINKING THEY CAN THIFFLET THE DEFENSE OVER, THE SECONDARY AGAINST TORREY SMITH. JIM: RICE TRIES TO GET INTO SECOND GEAR BUT IS MET QUICKLY BY HIGHTOWER. PHIL: THIS GAME DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE FIRST ONE TODAY. JIM: WELL, WE OPENED UP BY SAYING SAME TIME, SAME PLACE. IT IS THE SAME SCORE JIM: HERE'S A LOOK AT OUR NATIONWIDE INSURANCE SKYCAM. JIM NANTZ, PHIL SIMMS, ALONG WITH STEVE TASKER AND SOLOMON WILCOTS. BALTIMORE BREAKS HUDDLE HERE TO START THE SECOND QUARTER. FACING SECOND AND 7. FLACCO. FLIPS IT OVER. BALL COMES OUT AFTER THE CATCH BY LEACH. AND THEY'LL SPOT HIM OUT AT ABOUT THE 15. PHIL: JOE FLACCO WAS LOOKING DOWN THE FIELD FOR ANQUAN BOLDIN. HE WAS COVERED. VONTA LEACH, JUST A TREMENDOUS RUN BLOCKER. DOES HAVE GOOD HANDS. IT IS A CATCH, KNOCKED OUT OF HIS HANDS AND YOU MARK IT WHERE IT GOES OUT OF BOUNDS BECAUSE IT WENT BACKWARDS. JIM: A GAIN OF THREE OVERALL. LOOKING FOR A FIRST CONVERSION ON THIRD DOWN. FLACCO, MAN IS OPEN. HE FINDS HIM. PITTA. AND THE RAVENS ARE OUT TO THE 34. AND A PICKUP OF 18. PHIL: JOE FLACCO WAS TRYING TO THROW IT TO HIS RIGHT. WATCH TORREY SMITH. DENARD STONES HIM AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. HE CAN'T GET OFF AND BECAUSE HE'S WATCHING UP TOP TO THE RIGHT, THE DEFENSE MOVED. THAT'S WHY PITTA WAS WIDE OPEN. JIM: ON FIRST DOWN, RICE. AN EARLY HIT ON HIM BY COLE. HOLDS HIM TO TWO. RAY RICE. HE WAS OVER 100 AGAINST NEW ENGLAND IN SEPTEMBER AND HAD 1 1 LAST WEEK AGAINST DENVER AND THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL ON NEW ENGLAND TODAY. PHIL: THEY REALLY DID. I HEARD RAY RICE ON TV QUITE A FEW TIMES THIS MORNING. BUT IT'S TRUE. HE'S SMALL BEHIND A HUGE OFFENSIVE LINE. HARD TO FIND SOMETIMES. JIM: SECOND AND 8. FLACCO FINDS RICE. SPIKES IS THERE AND SPIKES DRAGS HIM DOWN BUT NOT UNTIL BALTIMORE ONCE AGAIN PICKS UP A FIRST DOWN. PHIL: SOMETHING SHOWING EARLY IN THIS GAME. THE COVERAGE IS EXCELLENT DOWN THE FIELD BUT BECAUSE OF ALL THAT EXTRA TIME NOW YOU GET THE MATCHUP YOU WANT. RAY RICE AGAINST THE MIDDLE LINEBACKER BRANDON SPIKES. KYLE ARRINGTON COMES IN FOR AQIB TALIB. TORREY SMITH NOT EVEN CLOSE. JIM: THEY HAVE NOT, SO FAR, HAD A RECEPTION BY A WIDE RECEIVER. AND THAT'S OUT TO THE 49. RICE AGAIN. COACH HARBAUGH AND HIS RAVENS CAME IN AND WON HERE BACK IN 2009, THE WILD CARD ROUND, ELIMINATING NEW ENGLAND. RICE HAD THAT ELECTRIFYING FIRST-PLAY 83-YARD TOUCHDOWN RUN. THE SECOND LONGEST IN NFL PLAYOFF HISTORY. PHIL: HARBAUGH SAID OUR TEAM IS NOT TOO EMOTIONAL FOR THIS GAME. WE'RE MATURE AND WE'RE NOT BITTER BECAUSE WE LOST UP HERE IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME LAST YEAR EITHER. JIM: PIERCE. SHIFTED TO GET PAST ARRINGTON AND THAT MOVE WILL PICK UP ANOTHER FIRST DOWN, IT APPEARS. PHIL: THAT'S AN EXCELLENT JOB. THIS TIME FLACCO WAS LOOKING DOWN THE FIELD BUT RIGHT AWAY, IF YOU DON'T COME UP AND COVER PIERCE, HE WAS GOING TO THROW IT TO HIM. HE WAS RIGHT ON TARGET SO HE COULD CATCH IT FULL SPEED GOING AHEAD. JIM: BALTIMORE ON THE NEW ENGLAND SIDE OF THE FIELD FOR THE FIRST TIME. PIERCE CUTS OUTSIDE. DENNARD FINISHES HIM OFF. THAT'S GOOD FOR FOUR. PHIL: GOOD BLOCK AGAIN, AS YOU LOOK AT THAT OFFENSIVE LINE. MICHAEL OHER, HE WAS THE LEFT TACKLE ALL YEAR LONG. NOW HE MOVES TO RIGHT TACKLE, WHERE HE IS REALLY -- THAT'S HIS SPOT. BECAUSE HE'S A GOOD PASS BLOCKER BUT HE'S AN EXCELLENT RUN BLOCKER SO NOW THEY'RE ABLE TO GO OUTSIDE TO THE RIGHT. JIM: SECOND AND 6 FROM THE PATRIOTS' 40. FLACCO. CAUGHT AT THE 15 BY TORREY SMITH! JUMPING UP INTO THE AIR AND TAKING IT FOR 25. PHIL: PERFECT TIME TO THROW THIS. THE PLAY-ACTION FAKE. LOOK AT HIM. HE THROWS TO THE BACK SIDE AND THAT'S WHERE YOU SHOULD THROW IT. THROW IT TO A BIG WIDE RECEIVER AND THROW IT HIGH. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING HIT UNTIL YOU GET TO THE GROUND. JIM: FLACCO IS 5-5 INTO THE WIND. UP THE MIDDLE, RICE! MCCOURTY HAS HIM DOWN LOW. PHIL: YOU SAID TO ME AFTER JOE FLACCO MISSED THE PASS UP THE SIDELINE TO PITTA, YOU SAID IS IT EASIER TO THROW INTO THE WIND? THE ANSWER IS MAYBE FOR SOMEBODY LIKE JOE FLACCO BECAUSE NOW HE CAN GAUGE IT AND FEEL IT BETTER. WHEN IT'S DOWNWIND SOMETIMES IT CAN GET AWAY FROM YOU. JIM: NOW INSIDE THE 10. SECOND AND 2. AND RICE. RICE DOWN TO THE 2. FIRST AND GOAL TO GO. PHIL: HOW ABOUT THAT BLOCKING ON THE RIGHT SIDE? WE SAW IT A FEW TIMES LAST WEEK, EVEN BY THE HOUSTON TEXANS. THEY JUST LINED UP AND RAN THE FOOTBALL TO THE RIGHT. NICE CUTOFF THAT TIME BY OSEMELE. BUT YANDA AND OHER. EXCELLENT JOB OF RUN BLOCKING HERE ON A COUPLE OF RUN PLAYS. JIM: THREE TIGHT ENDS IN FOR THE RAVENS. FIRST AND GOAL. LOOKING FOR PITTA. WHO MAKES THE CATCH BUT HE'S OUT OF BOUNDS. HE HAD HIGHTOWER ON HIM. PHIL: I DON'T KNOW IF I LIKE THAT -- NO, I DON'T LIKE IT. FIRST OFF, LOOK WHERE HIGHTOWER WAS LINED UP. HE PLAYED THE OUTSIDE SHOULDER AND HE WAS UP AGAINST HIM ON THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. SO HIGHTOWER HAS REALLY IMPROVED HIS PASS COVERAGE, HIS SPEED IN THE OPEN FIELD. THAT WAS PROBABLY A RUN PLAY AND THAT WAS AN OPTION, BUT JOE FLACCO TOOK THE THROW. JIM: DICKSON IN MOTION. NOW RILES CUTTING OUTSIDE AND RICE IS IN FOR THE TOUCHDOWN! -- PHIL: HE BROKE AWAY FROM BOTH HIGHTOWER AND MAYO. YOU CAN'T ALWAYS HAVE THEM ALL BLOCKED. SOMETIMES THIS IS WHAT MAKES FOOTBALL TEAMS AND REALLY GOOD OFFENSES. RAY RICE, THERE'S NOTHING THERE. IMMEDIATELY SLIDES TO THE OUTSIDE AND BREAKS THE TACKLES. BUT WE JUST GETS AWAY. HIGHTOWER -- WOULD HAVE BEEN A TOUGH TACKLE. GOOD STRAIGHT ARM BY RAY RICE. JIM: WE GOT A PATRIOT DE JIM: PATRICK CHUNG IS THE SECOND PATRIOT D.B. HURT IN THIS FIRST HALF. AQUEEB TALIB SENT TO THE LOCKER ROOM WITH A HAMSTRING. PLUS, THEY HAVE TWO INACTIVE FOR THIS GAME. DERRICK MARTIN AND MALCOLM WILLIAMS, NOT DRESSED. TUCKER FOR THE EXTRA POINT. 7-3 BALTIMORE. HOW ABOUT THE MOVE BY RICE? PHIL: RAY RICE MIGHT BE SHORT BUT HE SURE ISN'T SMALL. JIM: BACK HERE AT GILLETTE STADIUM AND AQIB TALIB IS OUT OF THE PATRIOT LOCKER ROOM HEADING BACK OUT. PHIL: HE'S NOT A SMALL CORNER, IS HE? JIM: NO, HE'S GOT SIZE AND HE'S MADE PLAYS. OF COURSE, HE'S HAD SOME ISSUES HELL-WISE SINCE BEING TRADED TO NEW ENGLAND MIDSEASON. HE WAS OUT WITH A HIP FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS. THAT BALTIMORE OFFENSE MANAGED ONLY THREE FIRST DOWNS IN THE FIRST QUARTER ON THREE DRIVES AND THEN JUST PUT TOGETHER A 90-YARD DRIVE. MCCOURTY RUNNING IT OUT FROM A YARD DEEP. JUST BACK TO THE 20. PHIL: LET'S LOOK AT ONE OF THE KEY PLAYS ON THAT LAST DRIVE. THE PLAY-ACTION FAKE. WELL-TIMED CALL, SECOND AND SHORT AND OPENING THE THROW INSIDE, THE BIG RECEIVER, AND THE DEFENSE CAN'T REACT AND RAY RICE -- SHOOT, SOME RUNNING BACKS YOU HAVE TO KNOCK THE DEFENDERS DOWN TWICE FOR THEM TO GET 10 YARDS. RAY RICE MADE SOMETHING HAPPEN WHEN THERE WAS NO RUNNING LANE. JIM: FIRST DOWN FOR NEW ENGLAND. AND THAT'S RIDLEY FOR THREE. THE BALL IS DOWN AT THE 24, 25, AND A FLAG IS OUT. REFEREE: AFTER THE PLAY, PERSONAL FOUL, NUMBER 59 OF THE DEFENSE. BLOW TO THE HEAD. 15-YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN. JIM: THAT'S ON ELLERBE. THIS IS THE SECOND MOST PENALIZED TEAM IN THE LEAGUE THIS YEAR, SECOND ONLY TO ST. LOUIS. PHIL: YOU CAN'T DO IT. YOU KNOW WHAT HARBAUGH SAYS ABOUT A PLAY LIKE THIS? HE SAYS WHEN YOU DO THINGS LIKE THAT YOU'RE JUST A SELFISH PLAYER. YOU HAVE TO RESTRAIN. GIVING NEW ENGLAND 15 YARDS NOT A GOOD THING TO DO. JIM: NEW ENGLAND AT THE 39. AND WELKER IS DECKED BY ELLERBE BUT HOLDS ON FOR SEVEN. YEAH, JOHN HARBAUGH STILL TALKS ABOUT IT. THAT UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS PERSONAL FOUL PENALTY FROM THAT A.F.C. CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AGAINST PITTSBURGH FOUR YEARS AGO. SECOND AND 3. NEW ENGLAND THAT IS FIRST DOWN. PHIL: THAT LAST PLAY, WE SAW BRANDON LLOYD CATCHING IT. MAKES ME THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DENVER GAME LAST WEEK. THIS RAVENS DEFENSE. THEY KEPT CREEPING IN ON THE DEFENSIVE SIDE AND THEY WERE HITTING THE RECEIVERS CATCHING THE FOOTBALL. JIM: FIRST DOWN. RIDLEY GETS A BURST UP THE MIDDLE FOR SEVEN, RUNNING BOYNE WENDELL. COMING UP, THE &quot;VERIZON HALFTIME REPORT.&quot; J.B., DAN, COACH COWHER, BOOMER AND SHANNON: SHANNON:. AND THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 49ERS' WIN OVER ATLANTA IN THE N.F.C. EARLIER TODAY. THAT MOVES THE CHAINS AFTER A FOUR-YARD GAIN. PHIL: TOM BRADY, IF HE LIKES THE DEFENSE HE SEES HE GOES WITH IT AND GOES WITH A QUICK SNAP. IF HE DOESN'T LIKE IT, HE'LL STAND UP, ALERT THEM, AND CHANGE THE PLAY. COREY GRAHAM. HE'S GOING TO CHANGE THE PLAY BECAUSE HE THOUGHT GRAHAM WAS GOING TO BLITZ. JIM: FIRST DOWN. OVER THE WELKER. WELKER. GETS GOING. INSIDE THE 20 AND FINALLY TWISTED DOWN BY SUGGS NEAR THE 15. PHIL: NOW WE KNOW WHY HE CHANGED THE PLAY. HERE COMES THE BLITZ. THROW OVER THE TOP OF IT. ONLY ONE GUY, ED REED, OUT TO MAKE THE TACKLE. JIM: AND AGAIN, WENDELL WAY DOWN THE FIELD MAKING ANOTHER KEY BLOCK. FIRST AND 10 AFTER THE 44-YARD GAIN AND RIDLEY GETS PAST THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, GOING BEHIND LOGAN MANKINS THAT TIME. PHIL: THAT SCREEN PLAY, SHOWS EVERYBODY WHY DISGUISING YOUR DEFENSE AGAINST QUARTERBACKS THAT HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OF THEIR OFFENSE. JIM: SECOND AND 2 FROM THE . HERNANDEZ AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN REQUEST WITH BROWN ON HIM. BRADY SEES IT, GOES TO HERNANDEZ. HE'S GOT THE FIRST DOWN NEAR THE 1. PHIL: YOU HAVE A TIGHT END LIKE HERNANDEZ. HE CAN SPLIT OUT AS A WIDE RECEIVER. WE'VE SEEN IT ALREADY THIS GAME, ALL THE SHAKES AND MOVES HE HAS. JIM: IF THIS DEFENSE GETS SET. HOUSTON LAST WEEK NEVER WAS READY IN THESE SITUATIONS. PHIL: LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO MAKE BRADY THROW THE FOOTBALL IN THE END ZONE. LOOK, EVERYBODY NEAR THE FIVE OFFENSIVE LINEMEN. ONE-ON-ONE COVERAGE AGAINST THE THREE RECEIVERS. JIM: FIRST AND GOAL. LOOKING FOR LLOYD. BATTED DOWN. PHIL: SERVE STANDING UP INSIDE. THEY DID A GOOD JOB. IT'S A CATCH AND THROW. THEY KNOCKED IT DOWN AND EXCELLENT COVERAGE ON THE OUTSIDE. JIM: HOLLAND BATTED IT DOWN AND REED WAS RUSHING IN AFTER BRADY, ALMOST GOT TO HIM. SECOND AND GOAL. AND RIDLEY -- HE'S HIT BY ARTHUR JONES FIRST. PHIL: I THOUGHT THEY BROUGHT ALL THOSE BIG GUYS IN THERE THAT TIME, THE GOAL LINE OFFENSE BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING TO FAKE IT AND THROW IT. A LOT OF TIMES THEY GO AGAINST THE LOOK. BIG PEOPLE IN, THEY THROW IT. SMALL PEOPLE IN, THEY RUN IT. BUT THE RAVENS THAT TIME TIMED IT. THEY WERE READY FOR THE SNAP COUNT. THAT WAS THE KEY. NO YARDS TO BE GAINED. JIM: NOW IT'S THIRD AND GOAL. 11TH PLAY OF THE DRIVE. WOODHEAD BACK TO THE BACKFIELD. BRADY FIRES IT. WELKER FOR THE TOUCHDOWN! PHIL: WELL, YOU KNEW THE PASS WAS GOING TO THE RIGHT SIDE. WHY? BECAUSE WHEN THERE'S LATE MOTION IN THIS OFFENSE, THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING TO GET THE ADVANTAGE. WELKER COMES IN MOTION, STACKS BEHIND BRANDON LLOYD. THEY MIX UP. WHO'S GOT THE FIRST GUY, WHO'S GOT THE SECOND? JIM: COREY GRAHAM AND BROWN ARE REALLY UPSET WITH ONE ANOTHER. LOOK AT THEM AFTER THIS. PHIL: YEAH, BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T SWITCH IT. I'LL TELL YOU WHY THEY MESSED IT UP WHEN WE SHOW ANOTHER REPLAY. JIM: WELKER WIDE OPEN. JIM: AFTER A 90-YARD DRIVE BY THE RAVENS, THE PATRIOTS COME BACK WITH A 79-YARD DRIVE THAT TOOK A LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES. GOSTKOWSKI KICKS. TO THE NUMBER ONE KICK RETURNER IN THE LEAGUE THIS YEAR BUT HE'S GOT NOWHERE TO RUN AS ARRINGTON IS DOWN IN A HURRY. &gt;&gt; THE NFL ON CBS IS SPONSORED BY -- JIM: JIM NANTZ, PHIL SIMMS BACK HERE IN FOXBOROUGH AND TALIB STAYS ON THE SIDELINES. AFTER THAT HAMSTRING INJURY SUFFERED EARLY IN THIS GAME. THIS ACTUALLY IS THE BEST STARTING POINT OF THE DAY FOR BALTIMORE, THE 14. PIERCE. DENNARD AND HIGHTOWER BOTH LOCKED DOWN THAT SIDE, TWO ROOKIES. PHIL: ON THIS TOUCHDOWN, THE TWO DEFENSIVE BACKS, I GOT THE INSIDE, YOU GOT THE OUTSIDE. THIS IS A PLAY THE PATRIOTS RUN ALL THE TIME. WHEN THEY BOTH GO OUTSIDE IT CONFUSES THE RULES THAT THE DEFENSIVE BACKS HAVE. THAT'S WHY WES WELKER WAS WIDE OPEN FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. THEY RUN THAT PLAY ALMOST EVERY WEEK, TOO. JIM: IT WORKS ALMOST EVERY TIME. AFTER A LOSS OF ONE, SECOND AND 11. LOOK AT PIERCE SHOWING THAT SPEED. AND MAYO RIDES HIS BACK OUT TO THE 19. PHIL: I KNOW ALL THE FANS HEAR THIS ALL THE TIME BUT THEY HAVE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL. THE PATRIOTS ARE STAYING BACK ON DEFENSE TO STOP JOE FLACCO'S THROWS DOWN THE FIELD. SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT THEY'RE JUST DARING YOU TO RUN THE FOOTBALL. THE RAVENS HAVE HAD SOME SUCCESS, BUT HERE'S WHERE THE PATRIOTS WANT IT -- THIRD DOWN. JIM: THIRD AND 6. RICE SPLITS OUT WIDE RIGHT. FLACCO. HE'S HIT. AND THEY GET TO HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS SEASON. NINKOVICH. AGAIN, THEY DIDN'T SACK HIM IN THE FIRST MEETING BACK IN SEPTEMBER BUT THEY GET TO HIM TONIGHT. PHIL: THE COVERAGE. LOOK TO THE RIGHT SIDE, THE BUNCH. JACOBY JONES FALLS DOWN. MAKES THE WHOLE PLAY A DISASTER. TIGHT COVERAGE BY THE REST OF THE DEFENSIVE BACKS AND THAT EXTRA TIME ALLOWS NINKOVICH, NOW A FULL-TIME RUSHER AND NOT A PART-TIME RUSHER AND PART-TIME LINEBACKER -- JIM: KOCH STANDING AT THE GOAL LINE. SPIRALED IT SHORT. ON THE RUN, WELKER. AND NEW ENGLAND ONCE AGAIN BACK MOTHER,&quot; TOMORROW ON AMERICA'S NUMBER ONE NETWORK, CBS. LOOK AT THAT ADVANTAGE. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AVERAGE DRIVE START. THIS ONE BEGINS AT THE 43 ON THE RAVENS' SIDE. AND RIDLEY OFF THE LEFT SIDE. BEHIND SOLDER AND MANKINS. HE HAS FIVE. THIS IS A YOUNG MAN, SECOND YEAR OUT OF L.S.U. THEY TOOK HIM IN THE THIRD ROUND. THEY LOVED HIM COMING OUT OF L.S.U. AND LOOKED AT HIM AS EQUAL VALUE WITH A RUNNING BACK OUT OF ALABAMA, THAT WENT IN THE FIRST ROUND, MARK INGRAM. PHIL: THEY SAID IT'S TOO MUCH TO SAY LET'S GO IN THE FIRST ROUND. LET'S MOVE BACK. PHIL: YOU KNOW, JIM, THE PATRIOTS DID THE RIGHT THING. THEY LET THE CLOCK RUN DOWN TO THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING. USE THE TIME AND TRY TO SCORE BUT DO NOT GIVE BALTIMORE THE FOOTBALL BACK WITH TIME, IF YOU CAN. JIM: SECOND AND 5 AND THE PATRIOTS DO HAVE ALL THREE TIME-OUTS. BRADY IS GOING TO RUN WITH IT. AND GETS THE OFFICIALS OUT OF THE WAY. PICKS UP ABOUT TWO. PHIL: WELL, THE CROWD IS ALL UPSET. YEAH, I THINK THE OFFICIALS STOPPED A 50-YARD GAIN THERE. OF COURSE, I'M KIDDING BUT TOM BRADY DOES THE RIGHT THING. YOU CAN'T SEE WHO'S BEHIND YOU. ONCE YOU SLOW DOWN, THESE DEFENSIVE LINEMEN WILL RUN YOU DOWN FROM BEHIND SO GET DOWN AND PROTECT YOURSELF. JIM: THIRD AND 3. RIDLEY. STACKED UP AND HE'S STOPPED ABOUT A HALF YARD SHY OF THE FIRST. FOURTH AND 1 COMING UP. PHIL: THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING. BILL BELICHICK MIGHT LET THE CLOCK RUN DOWN THEN MAYBE CALL A TIME-OUT AND GO FOR IT ON FOURTH DOWN. IF I WAS THE RAVENS I'D LET IT GO. I WOULD NOT CALL TIME-OUT. JIM: BRADY ON THIRD AND 1 OR FOURTH AND 1, 30 STRAIGHT CONVERSIONS ON SNEAKS. OH, A DIRECT SNAP TO WOODHEAD AND HE GETS IT FOR THE FIRST DOWN! PHIL: AS SOON AS YOU SEE THAT FORMATION, HE GOT TIGHT. YOU GOT TO BE READY FOR IT. IT'S AN UNUSUAL ALIGNMENT. PHIL: TOM BRADY IS TRYING TO GET THE DEFENSE TO LOOK AT HIM AND THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT DANNY WOODHEAD IS ABOUT ONE FOOT AWAY FROM HIM AND BEHIND, WHICH IS THE POSITION HE'S NEVER AT. SO THEY RUN THIS PLAY A LOT. IT'S JUST A LITTLE THING, JIM. JUST LIKE THE FAKE PUNT, HAVING RYAN MALLETT IN THERE. GIVES THEM THREE MORE DOWNS FOR SURE. JIM: PICKED UP SEVEN AND A FIRST DOWN AT THE 27. AND BRADY THROWS DOWN THE MIDDLE INCOMPLETE IN THE AREA OF AARON HERNANDEZ. AGAIN, THE &quot;VERIZON HALFTIME REPORT&quot; IS COMING BACK WITH JAMES BROWN AND THE CREW BACK IN THE STUDIO AND THEY'LL HAVE THEIR THOUGHTS ON THE FIRST HALF HERE. HIGHLIGHTS OF.C. CHAMPIONSHIP GAME WON BY THE 49ERS AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE THREE FINALISTS FOR THE WALTER PAYTON NFL MAN OF THE YEAR AWARD COMING UP ON THE &quot;VERIZON HALFTIME REPORT.&quot; THE 49ERS ON THE WAY TO THEIR SIXTH SUPER BOWL AND THE FIRST SINCE THE 1994 SEASON. THAT FRANCHISE 5-0 IN SUPER BOWL GAMES. SECOND AND 10. AND BRADY FIRES IT TO THE END ZONE. TO DEION BRANCH. PHIL: AND NOBODY OPEN. HE FIRES IT, BUT HE KNEW IT WAS SOMETHING THERE TO GET OPEN. LET'S WATCH KRUGER ON THE INSIDE, THE BEST PASS RUSHER. CONNOLLY KNOCKS HIM TO THE GROUND. JIM: ON THE OTHER END RAVENS HIT THE GROUND, COLLIDING WITH ONE ANOTHER -- JIMMY SMITH AND ED REED. PHIL: THAT TIME, JIMMY SMITH, IF THAT FOOTBALL WAS THROWN ON TARGET, HE WAS GOING UNDERNEATH FOR THE INTERCEPTION. JAY: THIRD AND 10 WITH 34 SECONDS TO GO IN THE HALF. BRADY. PRESSURE. THROWS. HITS HERNANDEZ AGAIN AND A FIRST DOWN AT THE 10! HE RAN AWAY FROM PAUL KRUGER. PICKS UP 17 ON THIS ONE. AND NEW ENGLAND'S CALLED A TIME-OUT. KRUGER ON HERNANDEZ. PHIL: WELL, THEY'RE TRYING TO GET TO THE QUARTERBACK. THEY MAKE TOM BRADY MOVE BUT THE PROBLEM IS HE MOVED RIGHT INTO THE BEST MATCHUP ON THE FIELD. PAUL KRUGER TRYING TO COVER AARON HERNANDEZ. AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DO SOMETIMES. YOU'RE GOING TO GAMBLE TO GET PRESSURE ON THE QUARTERBACK, YOU'RE GOING TO GET CAUGHT IN SITUATIONS JUST LIKE THAT. RAY LEWIS JUST TRYING TO OCCUPY A BLOCKER AS THE BLITZ COMES FROM THE OUTSIDE. TOUGH TO BLITZ THIS NEW ENGLAND OFFENSE AND EXPECT GOOD THINGS. JIM: BRANCH, WELKER, LLOYD, THE RECEIVERS. HERNANDEZ WITH SEVEN CATCHES. FIRST AND GOAL AT THE 10. BRADY STEPPING OUT, LOOKS BEHIND AND SLIDES DOWN AT THE 7. AGAIN, THEY HAVE ONE TIME-OUT. THEY HURRY TO THE LINE. BRADY WANTS TO SAVE IT. PHIL: I WOULD HAVE CALLED TIME-OUT BECAUSE NOW THIS IS GOING TO BE YOUR LAST PLAY WHERE YOU'D HAVE GOTTEN TWO IF YOU'D CALLED TIME. JIM: NOW THEY CALL TIME-OUT OUT OF DESPERATION WITH FOUR SECONDS. PHIL: EVERYBODY TRIES TO SAVE THEM. MANAGE THE CLOCK YOURSELF WHERE THE TIME-OUTS ARE USED. NOW THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO KICK THE FIELD GOAL, JIM. COVERAGE DOWN THE FIELD WAS REALLY GOOD THAT TIME BY THE RAVENS. THEY DOUBLE-TEAMED BRANDON LLOYD. BOY, TOM BRADY STUCK THAT LEG UP THERE. BUT RIGHT NOW IF YOU CALL TIME-OUT, YOU WOULD HAVE PROBABLY EASILY GOTTEN TWO PLAYS OFF TO THE END ZONE. JIM: THE TIME-OUT CAME FROM THE SIDELINE FROM BELICHICK. THAT'S A BREAK FOR BALTIMORE NOW AS GOSTKOWSKI IS OUT. PHIL: IT'S A HUGE BREAK. THESE ARE THE SITUATIONS FOR COACHES, GAME MANAGEMENT. IT'S SO CRUCIAL. JIM: GOOD FROM 31 IN THE FIRST QUARTER. THIS ONE FROM 25. THAT CLOSES OUT THE HALF WITH A 13-7 LEAD. PHIL: BRADY PUTS THAT LEG UP TO PROTECT HIMSELF. YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THERE OR YOU'LL GET HURT BY EXTENDING YOUR LEG. JIM: BRADY, 139 YARDS PASSDZING, THE TOUCHDOWN PASS TO WELKER. PHIL: GO BACK TO THAT TIME-OUT THAT THEY DID NOT USE. IT ALWAYS TAKES IN THE GAME LONGER TO RE-LINEUP AND MAYBE SPIKE THE BALL AND RUN THE PLAY THAN WHEN YOU PRACTICE IT DURING THE WEEK. JIM: LET'S GO DOWN TO SOLOMON WILCOTS. SOLOMON: COACH, WHAT CONCERNS YOU ABOUT THE WAY THIS HAS UNFOLDED IN THE FIRST HALF? &gt;&gt; I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT ANYTHING. WE'RE DOWN BY SIX. IT'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH BALLGAME DOWN TO THE WIRE. LET'S PLAY FOOTBALL. SOLOMON: WHAT DO YOU TELL YOUR TEAM AT HALFTIME? &gt;&gt; TELL THEM TO GO WIN THE GAME. JIM: AND BALTIMORE WILL RECEIVE THE SECOND-HALF KICK AFTER DEFERRING IT AT THE START. WE'LL BE BACK WITH THE &quot;VERIZON HALFTIME REPORT&quot; AFTER THIS MESSAGE. JIM: THE PATRIOTS LEAD IT 13-7 AND YOU CAN FOLLOW YOUR FAVORITE NFL TEAM. GO TO ITUNES.COM/NFL. FOOTBALL COMING TO THE RAVENS. JACOBY JONES READY TO POUNCE. HAD A 108-YARD RETURN AGAINST DALLAS THIS YEAR. ANOTHER ONE, 150-YARD RETURN FOR A TOUCHDOWN -- 105-YARD RETURN FOR A TOUCHDOWN AGAINST OAKLAND, PLUS A PUNT RETURNED FOR A SCORE. THIS KICK TRAVELS ONLY TO THE 11 WHERE JONES UNABLE TO GET STARTED. THAT'S EBNER ON THE TACKLE AND THAT WAS A BIG MOMENT RIGHT BEFORE THE FIRST HALF AND YOU WERE SPOT ON THERE BECAUSE IT'S STILL A ONE-SCORE GAME. PHIL: IT'S A BIG MISTAKE. YOU NEED EVERY OPPORTUNITY YOU CAN GET IN A PLAYOFF GAME. NEW ENGLAND LET TWO PLAYS GO WHERE IT COULD HAVE BEEN FOUR MORE POINTS. JIM: SO HERE COMES BALTIMORE WITH ITS BEST STARTING POINT OF THE GAME. PHIL: AND THE RAVENS HAVE TO BE VERY HAPPY. 13-7. THE GAME IS CLOSE. JUST WHAT THEY WANTED. JIM: COME OUT RUNNING IT ON FIRST DOWN WITH RICE FOR ONE YARD. LET'S GET A REPORT FROM STEVE TASKER. STEVE: WHEN I SBOKE TO BILL BELICHICK COMING OUT OF HALFTIME, THEY'RE ONLY 1-3 IN THE RED AREA. THEY HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO SOLVE THE RED ZONE DEFENSE OF BALTIMORE BECAUSE BELICHICK STILL BELIEVES FLACCO AND THE ABILITY OF THIS OFFENSE TO MAKE A BIG PLAY IS RIGHT THERE. JIM: AND TALIB IS NOT BACK OUT THERE AS THE SECOND HALF BEGINS. THE BEST CORNER. CAN FLACCO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT? SECOND AND . HE'S AIRING IT OUT DEEP. TRYING TO FIND SMITH AT THE 25 AND THERE WAS DOUBLE COVERAGE BACK THERE. ARRINGTON AND GREGORY BOTH. PHIL: THERE WAS. IT WAS A BLITZ. JOE FLACCO NEEDED JUST A LITTLE MORE TIME TO REALLY LAUNCH IT. HERE COMES THE BLITZ OFF THE SIDE AND WHEN HE GOES TO THROW THE FOOTBALL HE GETS HIT. AND WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO, JUST THROW IT RIGHT OVER THE TOP AND TRY TO OUT-THROW THE SAFETIES OF THE PATRIOTS. JIM: IT HAS BEEN A SILENT FIRST HALF FOR ANQUAN BOLDIN. SMITH WITH THAT ONE CATCH FOR 25 YARDS. THIRD AND 9. AND FLACCO LOOKING FOR BOLDIN. THERE HE IS! NOT SURE HE WAS TOUCHED, AND HE GETS BACK ON HIS FEET. MCCOURTY BRINGS HIM DOWN. PHIL: THIS WAS PERFECT. THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT FOR ANQUAN BOLDIN. THIS IS HOW THIS OFFENSE HAS CHANGED SO MUCH. WHEN THEY'RE COVERED, THEY STILL THROW IT. BOLDIN, COLE IS ALL OVER HIM WITH THE PERFECT POSITION, BUT WE'VE SEEN IT THE LAST TWO WEEKS. HE CAN GO UP. HE'S A BIG RECEIVER WITH GREAT HANDS AND CAN MAKE THOSE CONTESTED CATCHES. MARQUICE COLE, AS YOU SAW TALIB ON THE SIDELINE. THAT'S BOLDIN'S FIRST CATCH, GOES FOR 26. AND THEY CONTINUE TO RUN IT WITH RICE ON FIRST DOWN AND THE PATRIOTS ARE JUMPING ON IT. THAT TIME WITH MAYO AND SPIKES AND A LOSS OF A COUPLE. PHIL: AND I THINK BILL COWHER MADE A GOOD POINT AT HALFTIME. THERE'S A FINE LINE TRYING TO ESTABLISH THE RUNNING GAME AND CALLING PLAYS. I TALKED TO JIM CALDWELL, THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR OF THE BALTIMORE RAVENS. HE EVEN THOUGHT HE WAS TOO CONSERVATIVE LAST WEEK IN THE SECOND HALF WITH JOE FLACCO. YOU HAVE TO THROW IT ON FIRST DOWN TO GIVE YOUR QUARTERBACK SOME EASY THROWS AND TO KEEP HIM IN RHYTHM. JIM: SECOND AND 12 AT THE 50. FLACCO FLINGS IT. INCOMPLETE. AND FRANCIS THE ROOKIE RUSHER OUT OF RUTGERS HELPED INFLUENCE THAT THROW SO FLACCO DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE ZIP ON IT. PHIL: IT'S NOT THAT. IT'S THE COVERAGE. THIS DENNARD HAS REALLY TURNED INTO SOMETHING. HE IS ALL OVER TORREY SMITH TODAY. A LITTLE HAND FIGHTING AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR IN THE GAME. THE DEFENSIVE BACKS FOR NEW ENGLAND ARE BEING MORE AGGRESSIVE AND THEY'RE WINNING THE BATTLES AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. JIM: DENNARD, THE SEVENTH-ROUND PICK OUT OF NEBRASKA. ROOKIE. THIRD AND 12. LOBBING IT AND OVER THE HEAD OF TORREY SMITH. AND TALIB WAS MAYBE THE CLOSEST PLAYER TO THAT FOOTBALL, STANDING ON THE SIDELINE. PHIL: THEY'RE GETTING CONFIDENT THIS NEW ENGLAND DEFENSE, JIM. JUST LOOK AT THEM. THE RAVENS ARE JUST COMING OUT AND STANDING THERE SO THEY'RE JUST LETTING THE DEFENSIVE BACKS BEAT THEM AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. THEY CANNOT SEPARATE DOWN THE FIELD. THAT'S WHY THERE WAS NOWHERE FOR FLACCO TO THROW THE FOOTBALL. JIM: KOCH, FIFTH PUNT. FAIR CATCH. WELKER AT THE 9. 41-YARD PUNT. JIM: NEW ENGLAND LEADS BY SIX. THE LAST SIX A.F.C. CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES HAVE BEEN WON BY THE HOME TEAM. WHILE OVER ON THE N.F.C. SIDE, THE 49ERS BECAME THE THIRD STRAIGHT ROAD TEAM TO WIN. FIRST DOWN AND OVER THE MIDDLE. FALLEN ON BY CARY WILLIAMS. A GAIN OF SEVEN. PHIL: NEW ENGLAND HAS ABOUT 30 FIRST DOWNS TODAY. FOR BALTIMORE, NOTHING IS EASY FOR THEM SO FAR. THEY HAD ONE THROWOUT IN THE FLAT THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL. JOSH MCDANIELS, IF IT'S NOT WORKING PHYSICALLY, THEY'LL TRY TO BEAT YOU MENTALLY. JIM: SECOND AND 4 AND THERE WAS A HUGE HOLE ON THE HANDOFF TO RIDLEY AND HE'S GOT FIVE AND A FIRST. PHIL: WHEN YOU WATCH IT COMING INSIDE, FELLS GETS THE CRACKBACK AND RYAN WENDELL THE CENTER UP THE FIELD TO HELP OUT. RAY LEWIS, WE HAVEN'T CALLED HIS NAME SO FAR TODAY. HE FINALLY GETS IN THERE AND GETS A TACKLE. RIDLEY RUNS HARD. JIM: THIS IS COMING OFF OF GAMES IN WHICH LEWIS HAD 13 AND 17 TACKLES IN THE PLAYOFFS. ANOTHER FIRST-DOWN THROW. HERNANDEZ BOUNCES OFF THE TACKLE AND PICKS UP ANOTHER YARD OR TWO, GAIN OF FIVE. PHIL: WE TALKED ABOUT THOSE EXTRA YARDS AFTER THE CATCH. THEY MEAN A LOT. JIM: THAT'S EIGHT CATCHES FOR HERNANDEZ. SECOND AND 5. WIDE OPEN AND CAUGHT NEAR THE 50. WELKER. THERE'S A FLAG OUT. POLLARD IS GOING TO BE FLAGGED FOR IT. POLLARD HAS A LOT OF HISTORY AGAINST NEW ENGLAND. HE'S THE ONE -- REFEREE: PERSONAL FOUL, NUMBER 24, DEFENSE. 15-YARD PENALTY. FIRST DOWN. JIM: IT'S CALLED ENCOREY GRAHAM, NOT POLLARD. PHIL: WES WELKER RELEASES THE INSIDE. IT'S A LITTLE DOUBLE MOVE AS HE GOES UP THE FIELD. JIM: I THINK THEY GOT THE WRONG GUY. PHIL: YEAH, THEY DO. WELKER IS SUCH A SMALL RECEIVER, IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE SHOULDER TO THE HEAD, SO THAT'S AN EASY CALL FOR THE OFFICIALS TO MAKE. BUT DID YOU SEE THAT LITTLE MOVE BY WELKER? HE FAKED LIKE HE WAS GOING OUTSIDE, WHICH HE DOES A LOT, TOOK IT UP THE FIELD. BRADY DRILLS IT IN THIS THE SEAM. JIM: BRADY GOING LONG. OVER THE HEAD OF HERNANDEZ IN THE END ZONE. PHIL: THEY TRIED TO FAKE THE SCREEN, WHICH THEY THROW A LOT OF THEM AND IT WAS A GOOD TIME TO CALL THEM. WHEN THEY CROSS, THEY GET NEAR THE 30-YARD LINE, THEY LOOK FOR THE SHOT TO THE END ZONE. THE RAVENS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. STAYED BACK. EVERYBODY COVERED. JIM: SECOND AND 10. WOODHEAD. AND NGATA GOT AHOLD OF HIM IN A HURRY. PICKS UP THREE. PHIL: IT'S INTERESTING. WE'RE IN THIS SITUATION IN THE FIRST HALF WHERE IT'S THIRD DOWN. IS IT FOUR-DOWN TERRITORY BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING INTO THE WIND? OR WOULD YOU CONTINUE TO PLAY FIELD POSITION IF YOU THROW AN INCOMPLETE PASS HERE? JIM: THEY WERE ABOUT THIS EXACT SAME SPOT ON THE FIELD THE FIRST HALF AND PUNTED IT. LIKE YOU SAID, IF THEY DON'T PICK UP ANYTHING, WHAT WILL THEY DO? FOUR-RECEIVER SET. WELKER, IN AND OUT OF HIS HANDS! ONE HE SHOULD HAVE HAD. PHIL: THEY REALLY GOT THE DEFENSE TO STOP THE OUT THROWS BUT WES WELKER STILL GETS OPEN AND IT HAD TO BE A MISTAKE BY THE RAVENS. THE CORNER THAT TIME CAME ALL THE WAY INSIDE ON A LOOK WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE WES WELKER REALLY DOUBLE-TEAMED THERE. BALTIMORE VERY LUCKY BECAUSE OF THE DROP. JIM: YEP. WOULD HAVE BEEN A FIRST DOWN BY A COUPLE OF YARDS AND NOW MESKO, THEY WILL GO THE PUNTING ROUTE AGAIN FROM THE SAME POINT ON THE FIELD, SAME POSITION FROM THE FIRST HALF. REED. JIM: AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT OUR NATIONWIDE INSURANCE SKYCAM HERE AT GILLETTE STADIUM IN FOXBOROUGH, MASSACHUSETTS. ZOLTAN MESS CORKS 4-4 PUNTING TONIGHT. ALL FOUR OF HIS PUNTS HAVE PINNED BALTIMORE INSIDE 15. FLACCO OUT OF THE GUN ON FIRST DOWN AND THROWS IT -- FLAG IS OUT. HE WAS TRYING TO FIND DOSS AND DENNARD IS GOING TO BE FLAGGED FOR INTERFERENCE. THAT WAS A NEW LOOK ON FIRST DOWN. REFEREE: PASS INTERFERENCE, NUMBER 37, DEFENSE. FIRST DOWN. PHIL: JIM, IT WAS A NEW LOOK BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO THROW A BACK-SHOULDER THROW. IN OTHER WORDS, WHERE THAT IS DEFINITELY HOLDING OR PASS INTERFERENCE, WHERE YOU'RE MAKING DOSS TURN AND LOOK FOR THE FOOTBALL WHEN HE'S COVERED. NOT ENOUGH EASY THROWS. YOU HAVE TO HELP THE RECEIVERS WITH FORMATION AND MOVEMENT A LOT OF TIMES TO GIVE THEM SOME SEPARATION AWAY FROM THE DEFENSIVE BACKS. JIM: THE 15 YARDS PUTS IT AT THE 28 AND FLACCO. PASS DENIED. AGAIN HE WAS LOOKING FOR DOSS FOR THE SECOND STRAIGHT PLAY THREW IN HIS DIRECTION AND ARRINGTON DOES THE JOB ON THAT ONE. PHIL: YEAH, HE WAS ALL OVER IT. LOOK AT THE PRESSURE THESE DEFENSIVE BACKS ARE PUTTING ON THESE RECEIVERS. THEY'RE HITTING THEM AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. IT'S THROWING OFF THE TIMING AND THEN THEY CAN'T GET BACK INTO RHYTHM AND GET AWAY FROM THE DEFENSIVE BACKS. JIM: CHANGED THEIR APPROACH ON THIS SERIES. GOING GUN AGAIN. SECOND AND 10. AND THIS ONE IS A BIG GAIN OUT TO THE 50. GOOD FOR 22. PHIL: NOW, IF YOU THINK THERE'S A MATCHUP YOU LIKE IN A GAME AGAINST THE PATRIOTS, THEY HAVE REALLY BIG LINEBACKERS. NOW YOU HAVE BRANDON SPIKES. HOW ABOUT THAT MOVE AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE BY DENNIS PITTA? A GOOD SHAKE AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, GETS WIDE OPEN AGAINST A BIG MIDDLE LINEBACKER. JIM: ON FIRST DOWN. ANOTHER THROW. A LONG BALL. AND THERE'S CONTACT. BUT NO FLAG. INCOMPLETE. ARRINGTON GOT TANGLED UP WITH TORREY SMITH. PHIL: YOU SAW THE WIND BLEW THE FOOTBALL BACK TO THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD BECAUSE IT'S GOING A LITTLE LEFT TO RIGHT. ARRINGTON IN GREAT POSITION. THAT WAS A BIG PUSHOFF BY TORREY SMITH AND THAT'S JUST DENTAL TRIPPING, NOTHING. -- INCIDENTAL TRIPPING, NOTHING. GREAT JOB BY ARRINGTON. JIM: SECOND AND 10. RICE HAS IT. RICE! ABLE TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF NOTHING, PICKS UP 15. TO THE 35. PHIL: THE EXACT SAME WE SAW AGAINST THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS. THEY COVERED THE SCREEN PLAY INITIALLY TO RAY RICE TO THE RIGHT AND THEN HE STOPS AND COMES BACK INSIDE, JUST LIKE HE DID IN THE FIRST PLAYOFF GAME A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. HE KNEW IT WAS COVERED, HE GETS AWAY. FLACCO MADE A NICE ADJUSTMENT ON THE THROW. JIM: PIERCE IN AT RUNNING BACK. AND THAT'S TORREY SMITH. ANOTHER FIVE. DOWN TO THE 30. FOR EXCLUSIVE SUPER BOWL XLVII NEWS AND OFFERS PLUS DETAILS FOR A CHANCE TO WIN THE ULTIMATE SUPER BOWL LIVING ROOM PRIZE PACKAGE, TEXT &quot;SUPER BOWL&quot; TO 69635 OR GO TO NFL.COM/SUPER BOWL. PHIL: THIS IS A DIFFERENT ATTACK NOW. THEY'RE JUST PUTTING IT IN THE HANDS OF JOE FLACCO. JIM: THEY'VE ABANDONED THE RUN-FIRST MENTALITY. THEY GO TO THE DRAW AND PIERCE HAS THE FIRST DOWN. SCRAMBLES TO THE 21. PHIL: NOW YOU CAN BE MORE DECEPTIVE WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING THE FOOTBALL. SPREAD A BIG DEFENSE OUT, THE FRONT SEVEN. NOW THEY HAVE TO REACT FASTER AND IN SPACE. THAT'S HARD FOR THEM TO DO SOMETIMES. JIM: NINE-YARD RUN FOR THE ROOKIE WHO LEFT AFTER HIS JUNIOR YEAR AT TEMPLE. PHIL: TIGHT ENDS AND RUNNING BACKS, I LIKE THOSE MATCHUPS. JIM: FLACCO LOBS IT AND HE HAD A MAN THERE. IT WAS JACOBY JONES AND HE LED HIM TOO MUCH. PHIL: IT'S THE SAME THROW WE SAW IN THE FIRST HALF TO DENNIS PITTA. WHEN YOU THROW DOWN THE RIGHT SIDELINE THAT IS WHERE THE WIND IS BLOWING DOWNFIELD AND TO THE RIGHT. THAT'S A NICE MOVE. THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO HIT THIS, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO THROW IT ON A LINE. AND THE WIND IS UP HERE IN THE BOOTH IT'S PRETTY GUSTY. JIM: SECOND AND 10. AND THERE'S A HOOK-UP WITH ANQUAN BOLDIN FOR A FIRST DOWN. RIGHT IN FRONT OF COLE FOR 12. PHIL: THEY HAD THE PERFECT DEFENSE ON THAT TIME TO STOP IT. THEY HAD THE SAFETY COMING IN FOR THE INSIDE ROUTE AND HE WAS TOO LATE GETTING THERE TO EITHER KNOCK IT DOWN OR INTERCEPT THE FOOTBALL. JIM: FIRST AND GOAL. FLACCO. OH! MAYO ON PITTA. WHO SOMEHOW WAS ABLE TO GET THE CATCH AND GAIN FIVE. PHIL: LET'S WATCH THIS HIT. IT LOOKS REALLY HIGH. COMING ACROSS 2 FIELD. PUTS HIS SHOULDER INTO THE CHEST. THAT WAS A GOOD, CLEAN HIT, JIM. ARMS WRAPPED AROUND HIM. THE SHOULDER WAS BELOW THE NECK AREA. JIM: SECOND AND GOAL. RAVENS TRYING TO TAKE IT IN AND TAKE THE LEAD. FLACCO THROWS. GOT HIS MAN, PITTA FOR A TOUCHDOWN! PITTA SCORED A TOUCHDOWN AGAINST THE PATRIOTS IN SEPTEMBER. SCORED AGAINST THEM LAST YEAR IN THE A.F.C. CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AND HE'S IN THE END ZONE AGAIN TONIGHT. PHIL: THAT'S THE MATCHUP YOU WANT, THE TIGHT END AGAINST THE SAFETY. NICE SHAKE. WE SAW IT EARLIER AND HE'S GOING AGAINST THE SAFETY GREGORY. THAT'S A MATCHUP INSIDE WHERE YOU CAN GO UP THE FIELD OR IN AND OUT. THAT'S AWFULLY TOUGH FOR GREGORY TO COVER. JIM: TALKING TO BILL BELICHICK ON FRIDAY, HE HAD HIGH PRAISE FOR PITTA. SAID HE WAS SNEAKY AND DANGEROUS. THAT NEW APPROACH REALLY WORKED. FLACCO 6-9 ON THE DRIVE. JIM: THAT'S AN 87-YARD DRIVER BY THE RAVENS. THEY HAD A 90-YARD TOUCHDOWN DRIVE IN THE FIRST HAVE HAWAII AND DENNIS PITTA OUT OF BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY. TAKEN OUT OF THE 2004 DRAFT. HE WAS THE NEXT SELECTION IN THE DRAFT AFTER THE PATRIOTS TOOK A TIGHT END, THAT BEING AARON HERNANDEZ. PHIL: I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING THAT DRIVE, THE RAVENS, THE DEFENSE, THEY WANT TO CONTROL THE TEMPO. THEY PICKED THE TEMPO UP ON THAT LAST DRIVE BY LETTING JOE FLACCO STAY IN THE POCKET AND THROW IT. THEY SAID JOE, LET'S SEE IF WE CAN WIN THAT WAY. WHAT A GOOD DRIVE BY FLACCO. JIM: IT REALLY WAS A STATEMENT TO THE QUARTERBACK, WASN'T IT? GO WIN THE GAME. PHIL: AND THE PATRIOTS GOT PRETTY SIMPLE ON THE DEFENSIVE SIDE BECAUSE THEY GOT IN THE MODE OF TRYING TO STAY WITH AN OFFENSE THAT WAS MOVING FASTER THAN THEY'RE ACCUSTOMED TO. PHIL: AFTER THE SECOND ATTEMPT YOU HAVE TO BRING SOMEBODY IN TO HOLD IT. JIM: THAT WILL BE CHYKIE BROWN. SECOND-YEAR MAN OUT OF TEXAS. A COUPLE OF LONGHORNS TEAMING UP FOR THE KICKOFF. TUCKER KICKING IN THIS DIRECTION TO OPEN THE GAME, SEND IT A GOOD FIVE YARDS INTO THE BACK OF THE END ZONE. NOT THIS TIME. MCCOURTY. RUNS INTO A PACK AT THE 25. THAIN INCLUDES CHYKIE BROWN, WHO WAS HELD -- HOLDING OFF &gt;&gt; THE NFL ON CBS IS SPONSORED BY -- JIM: AND WE'RE BACK HERE WITH THE RAVENS LEADING IT. YOU SEE THE QUARTERBACK NUMBERS, ALMOST IDENTICAL IN YARDAGE. EACH WITH A TOUCHDOWN THROW, NO PICKS. BRADY COMES OUT IN THE SHOTGUN. SENDS VEREEN TO THE LEFT SIDE. WELKER. AND ELLERBE RIDES HIM DOWN. GAIN OF EIGHT, THOUGH. PHIL: WHEN YOU PUT A RUNNING BACK OUTSIDE OF WES WELKER, THE PERCENTAGES OF THAT FOOTBALL GOING TOWARDS WES WELKER, IF YOU HAVE A LINEBACKER, ARE PROBABLY ABOUT 100%. SO WELKER PUT A SHAKE ON ELLERBE AND HE WAS OPEN FOR TOM BRADY. JIM: SECOND AND 2 AND AGAIN THEY SPREAD OUT. VEREEN. PHIL: SAME LOOK. THEY'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE DEFENSE THIS TIME, THOUGH. JIM: THAT PASS TOO LOW FOR LLOYD. PHIL: IT WAS A GOOD THING IT WAS LOW. AND I KNOW TOM BRADY, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE RESPECT. I'VE SAID THIS ABOUT THESE TWO CORNERS. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CARY WILLIAMS AND TORREY GRAHAM, THEY ARE COMPETITORS. THEY'RE NOT AFRAID. THEY'LL GO FOR THE BIG PLAY, THE INTERCEPTION. JIM: THIS BALTIMORE DEFENSE, IT'S COORDINATOR WAS THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR FOR NEW ENGLAND 2008 THROUGH 2009. PHIL: THIS DEFENSE WAS A WRECK THE FIRST PART OF THE YEAR. JIM: WIDE OPEN WOODHEAD GOT THE FIRST. NEEDED TWO, GOT THREE. PHIL: DANNY WOODHEAD COMES THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. REFEREE: REPEAT FIRST DOWN. PHIL: THERE WAS A HOLDING PENALTY THERE. SO A LOT OF WORK BY THE PATRIOTS TO FIND A WAY TO THROW THE FOOTBALL SHORT, JIM. WE HEARD THE HALFTIME SHOW, BILL COWHER, BOOMER, ALL OF THEM TALKINGING ABOUT IT, CAN THE -- TALKING ABOUT IT, CAN THE PATRIOTS THROW THE BALL DOWN THE FIELD? JIM: THAT HOLDING PENALTY WAS ON NATE SOLDER, SO IT'S THIRD AND 12. AND INCOMPLETE. PHIL: IT LOOKED LIKE THAT FOOTBALL GOT TIPPED. JIM: I BELIEVE IT DID. PHIL: IT WAS OFF TARGET. AND AARON HERNANDEZ. YOU SEE 81 GOING UP THE FIELD. NEVER SEES IT. TRYING TO SEE IF IT DOES GET HIT. JIM: THAT WAS MCPHEE IN THE AREA. BUT NOT SURE THAT JUST DIDN'T COME OUT BADLY. BRADY, ONE OF HIS LAST FIVE THROWING INTO THE WIND. AND NOW MESKO. RIPS OFF A SPIRAL TO THE 26 TO JACOBY JONES. HE'S DOWN AT THE 37, SO THE RAVENS HAVE POSSESSION. JIM: TRYING TO GET TO THE SUPER BOWL DOWN TO NEW ORLEANS IN TWO WEEKS' TIME TO TANGLE WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS, WHO HAVE WON THE N.F.C. CHAMPIONSHIP EARLIER TODAY IN ATLANTA. PHIL: NEW ENGLAND IS STRUGGLING TO GET LINED UP. JIM: RICE. HIS KNEE TOUCHED THEY SAY. AND THAT WAS HIGHTOWER WHO COMES UP ON HIM. AND DROPS HIM AFTER THE CATCH FOR A LOSS OF FOUR. PHIL: WE'VE DONE A LOT OF NEW ENGLAND GAMES. I HAVEN'T SEEN MANY TEAMS RUN THESE SCREENS TO THE OUTSIDE AND HAVE SUCCESS AND PROBABLY THE BIGGEST REASON WHY IS BECAUSE THEY SEE IT ABOUT 10 TIMES EVERY DAY IN PRACTICE. THE BEST TEAM IN THE LEAGUE IS THE PATRIOTS THROWING THOSE TYPE OF PLAYS. JIM: WE SAW A COUPLE OF PASS RUSHERS COME IN TREVOR SCOTT, JERMAINE CUNNINGHAM. SECOND AND 14. FLACCO TO A WIDE-OPEN TORREY SMITH! OVER TO THE NEW ENGLAND SIDE OF THE FIELD AT THE 44. PHIL: THAT TIME HE GOT THE SEPARATION. THEY CHANGED THE DEFENSE UP A LITTLE AND DENNARD WAS EXPECTING HELP INSIDE SO THEY GOT THE PERFECT PLAY ON FOR THAT DEFENSE. JIM: AND IT GOES FOR 23. FLACCO IN THIS QUARTER HAS THREE COMPLETIONS THAT HAVE GONE FOR OVER 20 YARDS. FOUR ON THE GAME. THERE'S A FLAG OUT AS RICE RUNS ON A FIRST DOWN FOR FIVE. PHIL: COULD BE OFFSIDES. REFEREE: OFFSIDE DEFENSE. FIVE-YARD PENALTY. REPEAT FIRST DOWN. PHIL: WELL, THEY LOVE TO TIME UP THE SNAP COUNT AND THESE LINEBACKERS AND BRANDON SPIKES, 55, ONE OF THE BEST THERE IS. WELL, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN NINKOVICH COULD HAVE JUST LINED UP OFFSIDES. I DIDN'T HEAR WHAT NUMBER HE SAID WAS THERE, SO -- JIM: FIRST AND 5. FROM THE 39. THEY GIVE IT TO RICE AGAIN. THAT'S GOOD FOR THREE. NEXT SUNDAY, KICK OFF SUPER BOWL WEEK WITH THE NFL PRO BOWL, PRESENTED BY MCDONALD'S. FOR MORE INFO VISIT NFL.COM/PROBOWL. NOW THEY BRING IN PIERCE. PHIL: THIS OFFENSE, WHEN YOU DO IT THIS WAY, IT GETS THE WIDE RECEIVERS IN RHYTHM. GETS THEM MORE CHANCES. THEY CAN START GIVING THE DEFENSE DIFFERENT LOOKS AND IT ALSO TIRES OUT THE PASS RUSH. JIM: FLACCO LOOKING FOR SMITH AND IT'S INCOMPLETE AND I BELIEVE THE WIND INFLUENCEED THAT ONE AGAIN. PHIL: YEAH, THAT TIME FLACCO UNDERTHREW IT, BELIEVE IT OR NOT. AND HOW ABOUT DENNARD? JIM: THAT BALL ALSO SAID TO THE RIGHT. AGAIN, THE WIND IS BLOWING IN THAT DIRECTION. PHIL: THAT COULD HAVE BEEN THROWN UP THE FIELD A FEW MORE YARDS. DENNARD, BESIDES ONE OR TWO PLAYS, HAS BEEN OUTSTANDING TODAY. JIM: 33 DEGREES, FEELS LIKE 23. WIND HOVERING AROUND 20. THIRD AND 2. THEY GOO WITH PIERCE. PIERCE GETS OUTSIDE. HAS THE FIRST DOWN. AND GALLOPS OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 24. PHIL: WHAT A SET OF EYES THIS PIERCE HAS. EVERY TIME HE RIGHT AWAY MAKES THE ASSESSMENT THAT HE'S GOT TO GO OUTSIDE AND NOT IN. THAT CALL WAS SUPPOSED TO GO BETWEEN THE GUARD AND TACKLE. THAT'S ABOUT THE THIRD TIME WE'VE SEEN HIM BREAK OUT TODAY. JIM: HE BROKE OUT FROM NINKOVICH. PICKS UP 11. ANOTHER NEW SET OF DOWNS. LOOK AT PIERCE TAKING A COUPLE OF PATRIOTS WITH HIM. FOR SIX. PHIL: WELL, YOU HAVE TO GIVE JIM CALDWELL A LOT OF CREDIT, THIS CHANGE OF STRATEGY. BEING MORE AGGRESSIVE AND TAKE IT TO THE PATRIOTS' DEFENSE. JIM: THE RAVENS HAD 130 YARDS OF OFFENSE IN THE FIRST HALF. THEY HAVE 136 IN THIS QUARTER. SECOND AND 4. FLACCO HAS PITTA AGAIN FOR A FIRST. PHIL: IT'S LIKE STEVE TASKER SAID TO US. THEY'RE SO CONCERNED AND WORRIED ABOUT SOME OF THE UPFIELD THROWS NOW THEY'RE ALLOWED A FEW OF THESE PLAYS. AND THE LINEBACKERS ARE SO DEEP THAT JOE FLACCO SEES PITTA UNDERNEATH AND TAKES IT FOR THE FIRST DOWN. JIM: THIS QUARTER THEY'VE PUT THE GAME IN FLACCO'S HANDS. FLACCO, WHO TURNED 28 ON WEDNESDAY, HAS RESPONDED. SECOND LONG DRIVE OF THE QUARTER AND FLACCO FINDS A MAN. IT'S BOLDIN AT THE 10. IT TAKES TWO PATRIOTS TO BRING HIM DOWN AT THE 5. PHIL: NICE HEAD BOB AND FAKE UP THE MIDDLE AND THEN HIS OUTLET RECEIVER IS TO THE OTHER SIDE. LOOK DOWN THE MIDDLE, IT'S NOT OPEN. LOOK TO YOUR LEFT AND BOLDIN. WATCH THE MOVE, THE PLAY-ACTION FAKE. THAT WAS A GOOD DECISION NOT TO THROW IT DOWN THE MIDDLE. JIM: FLACCO HAS THROWN FOR 123 YARDS IN THIS QUARTER. 30 SECONDS TO GO IN THE THIRD. HE'S GOT SECOND AND 2. FROM THE 5. RICE UP THE MIDDLE. HE PLOWS AHEAD FOR WHAT APPEARS TO BE A FIRST DOWN TO CLOSE OUT THE THIRD. BALTIMORE 14, NEW ENGLAND 13 THRO JIM: ONE QUARTER TO GO FOR THE SUPER BOWL. TO BE THE A.F.C. ENTRY INTO SUPER BOWL XLVII. FIRST AND GOAL TO GO. RAVENS PUTTING TOGETHER ANOTHER IMPRESSIVE DRIVE. THROWING ON FIRST AND GOAL. UP TOP AND BOLDIN HAS IT! TOUCHDOWN, BALTIMORE. PHIL: THIS GUY IS SOMETHING ELSE. THAT'S JUST KNOWING WHO HE'S THROWING THE FOOTBALL TO. IF THAT'S NOT BOLDIN HE DOESN'T THROW. BUT BOLDIN IS A TIGHT END THAT PLAYS WIDE RECEIVER AND WE TALKED ABOUT HOW HIS HANDS -- HOW ABOUT THIS. HE WENT TO FLORIDA STATE TO -- BE A QUARTERBACK. TURNED INTO A WIDE RECEIVER AND A PRETTY GOOD MOVE BY HIM. WAY TO GO UP AND JUST GRAB THE FOOTBALL. YOU NEVER SEE HIM BOBBLE THE FOOTBALL WHEN HE GOES FOR THE CATCH. JIM: ALL FOUR CATCHES FOR BOLDIN COMING OFF THE -- AFTER THE INTERMISSION. 49 YARDS AND THE TOUCHDOWN. PHIL: JIM, THE DEFENSE WAS NOT FOOLED. THEY'RE ALL OVER IT. IF YOU'RE NEAR HIM HE CAN GO UP AND GET THROUGH THE TIGHT COVERAGE AND JUST RIPS IT OUT OF THE AIR. THE PLAY-ACTION FAKE. MCCOURTY, A BIG SAFETY, IS ALL OVER HIM GRABBING HIM. DOESN'T AFFECT HIM. JIM: BOLDIN TOLD US LAST NIGHT THAT IT'S NOT OFTEN YOU GET THIS OPPORTUNITY TWICE. WE LEFT THE STADIUM LAST YEAR WITH A BAD TASTE IN OUR MOUTHS. WE RELISH THIS CHANCE. PHIL: I SAID WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IF THEY'RE UP THERE AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE CHALLENGING YOU ALL THE TIME? HE SAID I DON'T CARE, I'M STRONGER THAN THEY ARE AND I'LL GET IT DONE. THAT WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE RIGHT THERE. WHEN HE WAS -- HE'S COVERED YOU STILL THROW IT TO HIM. JIM: SO THAT'S A 10-PLAY DRIVE. 63 YARDS. AND THE RAVENS NOW STARTING TO OPEN UP THINGS WITH THIS OFFENSE AND BACK-TO-BACK TOUCHDOWN DRIVES, ENGINEERED BY FLACCO. PHIL: THEY PUT THE NEW ENGLAND DEFENSE, THEY MADE THEM GUESS WHAT PLAY WAS COMING. IT TIRES THEM OUT. THEY HAD TO REACT INSTEAD OF ATTACKING. NEW ENGLAND WAS ATTACKING THIS BALTIMORE OFFENSE IN THE FIRST HALF. JIM: 14 UNANSWERED BY THE RAVENS AFTER TRAILING 13-7 AT HALFTIME. IT'S MCCOURTY. SHAKES OFF ONE HIT BUT NOT THE SECOND. CONSIDINE IS THERE TO BRING HIM DOWN. WELCOME BEYONCE TO THE PEPSI SUPER BOWL HALFTIME SHOW ON CBS. SUBMIT YOUR PHOTO AT CBSSPORTS.COM/PEPSI FOR A CHANCE TO BE SEEN BY MILLIONS. PHIL: YOU HEARD ME SAY HOW THIS DEFENSE STRUGGLED FOR PART OF THE YEAR. THEY GOT THEIR BYE WEEK, THEY REPOSITIONED SOME PLAYERS AND STRAIGHTENED OUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THEY HAD. JIM: FIRST DOWN CARRY BY RIDLEY, FOR ABOUT NINE BEHIND THE CENTER WENDELL. HOW ABOUT THAT 49ER VICTORY AFTER BEING DOWN SO BIG EARLY? PHIL: IT WAS A TREMENDOUS COMEBACK, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. ANOTHER OUTSTANDING GAME BY COLIN KAEPERNICK. JIM: SECOND AND 1. THEY STOPPED RIDLEY SHORT. LEWIS IN ON THAT PILE. NOW, THAT N.F.C. GAME WAS BEING SHOWN ON THE BIG SCREEN HERE. WHEN IT ENDED WE CAUGHT JOHN HARBAUGH WITH THIS REMARK. &gt;&gt; HEY, JIM, CONGRATULATIONS. YOU DID IT. YOU'RE A GREAT COACH. LOVE YOU. PHIL: WE HAD SOME GOOD LAUGHS LAST NIGHTS TALKING TO JOHN HARBAUGH ABOUT HIS BROTHER JIM. JIM: THIRD DOWN AND 1. RIDLEY. ABLE TO SLIDE PAST A COUPLE OF DEFENDERS. HAS THE FIRST DOWN. WELL, JOHN HARBAUGH IS 15 MONTHS OLDER THAN JIM AND OF COURSE, THEY COACHED TOGETHER, OR COACHED AGAINST ONE ANOTHER ON THANKSGIVING NIGHT A YEAR AGO, 2011. THE FIRST TIME TWO BROTHERS FACED EACH OTHER AS NFL COACHES. THE RAVENS WON THAT ONE 16-6. THEY STILL TALK ABOUT IT. FIRST AND 10. THAT'S LLOYD. A BEAUTIFUL MOVE TO GET AWAY FROM CHYKIE BROWN. PHIL: HE CAUGHT IT AND NOW THE -- OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE SAW CHYKIE BROWN AND HE WAS ABLE TO MAKE THE MOVE AS HE HIT THE GROUND BRANDON LLOYD, REALLY TALENTED WIDE RECEIVER, GOOD ROUTE RUNNER. THAT FOOTBALL WENT BETWEEN BOTH OF NGATA'S ARMS. BUT STAYS PATIENT AND STAYS IN THE GAME EVEN THOUGH HE DOESN'T GET A LOT OF BALLS THROWN HIS WAY. HANDOFF TO RIDLEY. HE'S HIT AND THE BALL IS OUT. HE WAS WALLOPED BY POLLARD. AND IT'S RECOVERED BY THE RAVENS. AND RIDLEY IS FLAT ON HIS BACK. PHIL: HE'S TRYING TO GET UP. PHIL: THEY'VE MADE NO SIGNAL YET. JIM: THAT'S ARTHUR JONES RUNNING OFF THE FIELD WITH THE FOOTBALL. WHOSE BROTHER CHANDLER JONES, OF COURSE, IS ON THE PATRIOTS SIDE.

IT WAS A FUMBLE. JIM: THE BALL BOUNCED OFF HIS OWN KNEE. ALMOST DOWN, PHIL. PHIL: THE HIT BY POLLARD IS SO HARD YOU COULD HEAR IT CLEANLY ALL THE WAY UP HERE IN THE BOOTH. JIM: AND THE FIRST TURNOVER OF THE GAME FORCED BY THE RAVENS. TAKING OVER AT THE NEW ENGLAND 47. FLACCO TO SMITH. HE'S WRESTLED DOWN BY ARRINGTON, BUT ANOTHER PASS PLAY FOR 16 AND RIDLEY IS HEADING IN. THAT WAS SOME HIT BY POLLARD. PHIL: SOME HIT. HE WAS OUT. THAT'S WHY HE FUMBLED. GOOD JOB BY THE RAVENS ON THAT FIRST DOWN. THEY BLOCKED IT UP WHERE THERE WAS A BLITZ AND HIT THE WIDE-OPEN RECEIVER. JIM: FLACCO WAS READY TO UNLOAD, NOW RUNS WITH IT. AND THIS IS SOMETHING COACH BELICHICK TALKED TO US ABOUT ON FRIDAY. HE'S GOTTEN US ONCE A GAME, WHERE FLACCO ESCAPES AND RIPS OFF A GOOD RUN. PHIL: FOR 6'6&quot;, HE MOVES AROUND THE POCKET AND OUTSIDE THE POCKET VERY WELL AND THAT RUN, HEY, BIG PLAY. JIM: 14 YARDS. PHIL: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A TEAM THAT HAS AN EIGHT-POINT LEAD. FIELD GOAL RANGE. OF COURSE, A FIELD GOAL IS BIG HERE TOO. JIM: FIRST DOWN FROM THE 17. THAT'S JACOBY JONES. PHIL: YOU DON'T SEE THIS A WHOLE LOT. WHEN I CAME IN THE GAME TODAY, I SAID OK, THE WEATHER, THE CIRCLESES -- CIRCUMSTANCES. CAN THE RAVENS THROW THE BALL DOWN THE FIELD TO MAKE THOSE THREE OR FOUR REALLY BIG PLAYS THEY MAKE EVERY ZPAME -- GAME? I DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY COULD BUT FLACCO AND CALDWELL IS SHOWING THEY CAN THROW IT UNDERNEATH AND GIVE THEMSELVES A CHANCE TO WIN TOO. JIM: PITTA WIDE TO THE LEFT. SECOND AND4. PITTA HAS ARRINGTON ON HIM. BOLDIN IN A SLOT AND THEY'RE GOING BACK TO BOLDIN FOR THE TOUCHDOWN! THEY GOT BOLDIN MATCHED UP WITH MARQUICE COLE AND BOLDIN HAS HIS SECOND TOUCHDOWN OF THE GAME. PHIL: IT'S THE SIZE DIFFERENCE AND THAT'S WHAT THEY GO FOR. DIDN'T YOU THINK WHEN HE THREW IT THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE AN OVERTHROW? NO HELP FROM MARQUICE COLE. SAFETY UP THE MIDDLE. AND FLACCO SEE THAT IS RIGHT AWAY. THEY'VE MASTERED THROWING THE BALL DOWN THE MIDDLE, BACK SHOULDER. LET THE RECEIVER GO UP WITH TWO HANDS AND BRING IT DOWN. AND WHO BETTER TO THROW IT TO THAN ANQUAN BOLDIN? COLE GOT HIS HAND IN AT THE LAST SECOND. NOT ABLE TO KNOCK IT OUT. JIM: EXTRA POINT BY TUCKER IS GOOD. 21 UNANSWERED BY THE RAVENS. &gt;&gt; THE NFL ON CBS IS SPONSORED BY -- JIM: JOE FLACCO HAS TAKEN CONTROL OF THIS GAME IN THE SECOND HALF. HE'S HIT 11 OF HIS LAST 12 THROWS. HE'S THROWN FOR THREE TOUCHDOWNS ON THE NIGHT. PHIL: YOU'RE RIGHT. HE THROWS IT BETTER INTO THE WIND THAN DOWNWIND. JIM: IT REALLY LOOKS THAT WAY, DOESN'T IT? MCCOURTY GETTING ANOTHER CHANCE TO RUN ONE. GOT AWAY FROM CONSIDINE. AND CHYKIE BROWN HAD THE ANGLE ON HIM. THE PATRIOTS TWO SCORES BEHIND HERE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER WITH 11 MINUTES TO GO. BERNARD POLLARD. THE HISTORY WE TALKED ABOUT WITH NEW ENGLAND. HE HAD THE HIT ON BRADY THAT BLEW OUT HIS KNEE. AND WELKER, HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE TEXANS BACK THEN. AND GRONKOWSKI GOT HURT. INJURED HIS ANKLE IN LAST YEAR'S CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. HE PUTS THE JARRING HIT ON RIDLEY THAT CREATES THE TURNOVER AND THE RAVENS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT WITH A TOUCHDOWN A FEW PLAYS LATER. THE PASS ON THE MARK. BRANDON ALLOWED -- LLOYD. PHIL: BEAUTIFUL THROW AND TIMING. NICE JOB BY TOM BRADY STEPPING UP IN THE POCKET. NOW THIS GIVES PAUL KRUGER AND THAT PASS RUSH A CHANCE TO GET TO THE QUARTERBACK. A LOT OF OBVIOUS PASSING SITUATIONS. JIM: TO VEREEN. HE GETS HIS BALANCE. HE'S GOT NINE YARDS. SECOND-YEAR BACK OUT OF CAL. HIS FATHER HENRY WAS DRAFTED BY THE TAMPA BAY BUCS IN THE SAME DRAFT CLASS THAT YOU WERE A PRODUCT OF. HIS DAD DRAFTED BY TAMPA IN THE NINTH ROUND IN 1979. HE ENDED UP PLAYING FOR B.C. IN THE CANADIAN LEAGUE. SECOND AND 1 AND THAT'S A FIRST DOWN CATCH. LLOYD. THEY CALLED IT INCOMPLETE. INCOMPLETE. THIRD AND 1. WE'RE JUST RECEIVING WORD FROM THE PATRIOTS THAT RIDLEY WILL NOT RETURN AFTER A HEAD INJURY. GIVE TO VEREEN. THIS KID VE SERENE SOME IMPRESSIVE BACK. HE WAS REALLY HAMPERED ALL HIS ROOKIE YEAR WITH HAM SPRING -- HAMSTRING INJURIES AND NOW THAT HE'S HEALTHY HE'S STARTING TO MAKE PLAYS. FAVRE WE TALKED ABOUT IT LAST WEEK, HOW GOOD A PASS RECEIVER HE IS. BELICHICK SAID HE'S A THREE-DOWN BACK. JIM: QUICK THROW TO WELKER AND WELKER IS SMASHED AT THE 38. THE SECOND ANNUAL NFL HONORS FEATURES FOOTBALL'S BIGGEST STARS. FIND OUT WHO WILL BE THE ROOKIE OF THE YEAR. THE WALTER PAYTON NFL MAN OF THE YEAR AND MORE, FEBRUARY 2 ON CBS. PHIL: JIM, DO THE RAVENS MAKE YOU PAY ON THESE SHORT PASSS? JIM: THEY PUNISH YOU. PHIL: JUST SO MANY BIG HITS. JIM: THAT WAS CARY WILLIAMS WHO GOT WELKER A LITTLE WOBBLY. SECOND AND 5. TO VEREEN. VEREEN NOW BECOMING A PART OF THE PATRIOT ATTACK. HE HAD A 4.0 G.P.A. IN HIGH SCHOOL AND AGGRAVATED ASSAULTED FROM CAL BERKELEY IN THREE AND A HALF YEARS. PHIL: YEAR, PRETTY SMART. THEY'RE ALL DROPPING BACK, PROTECTING THE MIDDLE. EASY COMPLETIONS. NOBODY THERE. GETTING BIG RUNNERS. JIM: FIRST DOWN TO DEION BRANCH AND HE'S WRESTLED DOWN BY JIMMY SMITH AFTER SIX. SO NINE MINUTES TO GO AND BRADY AND THE PATRIOTS ARE FINALLY GETTING THE OFFENSE GOING FOR REALLY THE FIRST TIME IN THE SECOND HALF. OUT TO VEREEN, WHO DROPS IT. HE WAS LOOKING UPFIELD AND SAW THAT ELLERBE WAS WAITING. PHIL: YEAH, THAT DEFENSE CLAMPED DOWN A LITTLE THAT TIME. THEY PUT THE PRESSURE ON THEIR OUTSIDE GUYS. AND THAT'S WHY THERE ARE TWO DEFENDERS THAT ARE GOING TO COME INTO THE PICTURE PRETTY QUICKLY THERE TO HIT SHANE VEREEN. JIM: THIRD AND 4. PASS TO WELKER INCOMPLETE. PHIL: WELKER IS TIRED AND THAT TIME BERNARD, POLL -- BERNARD POLLARD, WHO CANNOT COVER WELKER. HE JUST BEATS HIM LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. JIM: FOURTH AND 4. AT THIS POINT, 8:35 TO GO, THE PATRIOTS HAVE TO GO FOR IT. PHIL: NO QUESTION. IF THEY DO SCORE, THEY'LL KICK THE EXTRA POINT. I'M ALMOST POSITIVE ABOUT THAT. JIM: BRADY SLIDING OUT OF THE POCKET AND NOW RELEASES IT INCOMPLETE! PHIL: HE COULD HAVE RUN FOR IT. HE HAD IT. HE'S OUT IN THE OPEN. I DON'T THINK HE REALIZED HE HAD FOUR YARDS TO GO WHEN HE DECIDED IT WAS TOO LATE. JIM: THE RAVENS TAKE OVER ON DOWNS. JIM: WE'RE BACK WITH BALTIMORE AT THE 19-YARD LINE. THE DEFENSE HAVING JUST MADE A STAND. PHIL: STAYS IN THE SHOTGUN WHICH I THINK IS THE HINGE TO DO. STAY AGGRESSIVE. JIM: FLACCO DUCKS DOWN. IT WILL GO IN THE BOOKS AS A SACK. AND BY THE WAY, NEXT WEEKEND, THE PGA TOUR ON CBS PREMIERES WITH THE FARMERS INSURANCE OPEN AT TORREY PINES. TIGER AND PHIL. OF COURSE, THEY HAVE GLORIOUS RECORDS THERE AT TORREY PINES. THEY'RE BOTH IN THE FIELD AND BRANDT SNEDEKER, THE FEDEXCUP CHAMPION, IS THE DEFENDING CHAMPION THERE OUTSIDE OF SAN DIEGO. WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEKEND. PHIL: IT'S UP TO JOE FLACCO TO MAKE SURE YOU USE ALL THE TIME ON THE CLOCK. JIM: SECOND AND 11. AND THE PASS UNDER PRESSURE. THROWN AWAY. BRANDON SPIKES WAS ALL OVER FLACCO. PHIL: HE'S ONE OF THE BEST IN THE NFL. HE'S GOT A GREAT FEEL FOR OFFENSE. HE KNOWS HOW TO TIME THE SNAP COUNT ON EVERY QUARTERBACK THEY PLAY AGAINST, AND THE OFFENSIVE LINE, NOBODY EVEN SEES HIM. FLACCO, GOOD JOB OF THROWING IT AWAY. JIM: OF COURSE, THE INCOMPLETION STOPS THE CLOCK AT 7:40. BALTIMORE NEEDS TO GET TO THE 29 FOR A FIRST. NINKOVICH COMING IN. FLACCO ABLE TO GET AWAY AND THROWS IT SHORT OF BOLDIN. A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL SAY WHY DIDN'T THEY RUN IT A LITTLE BIT, TAKE SOME TIME OFF THE CLOCK? PHIL: I THINK I MIGHT BE ONE OF THOSE GUYS. LISTEN, THEY KEEP TWO PEOPLE IN THE BACKFIELD. I FIGURED THEY KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET A CERTAIN COVERAGE, GET THE EXTRA PROTECTORS BACK THERE, BUT THEY RELEASE ON THE PASS, AND FLACCO, TWO HANDS ON THE FOOTBALL, AVOIDS A DISASTER. JIM: MORGAN COX WILL SNAP IT BACK TO SAM KOCH. WELKER WAITS TO FIELD IT. AND THE WIND PLAYING HAVOC WITH THAT PUNT. THAT IS DOWN AT THE 40 BY JAMES IHEDIGBO. &gt;&gt; THE NFL ON CBS IS SPONSORED BY -- JIM: NEW ENGLAND WITH HALF A QUARTER TO GO. DOWN 28-13. WIDE OPEN! WELKER TAKES IT DOWN TO THE 22! GRAHAM FINALLY ABLE TO CATCH UP TO HIM. PHIL: THIS IS HOW THEY GET SO MANY OF THEIR BIG PLAYS. WES WELKER, ONCE AGAIN THE DOUBLE MOVE ON THE SLOT RECEIVER AND COREY GRAHAM CANNOT STAY WITH HIM. THEY CAUGHT THEM WITH JUST ONE SAFETY BACK. THAT WAS THE PERFECT PLAY FOR WELKER. JIM: LONGEST PLAY OF THE NIGHT FOR THE PATRIOTS, 36 YARDS. BALL TIPPED AND INTERCEPTED! IT'S ELLERBE WHO HAS HIS HANDS ON IT. PHIL: BOY THIS DEFENSE. EVERYTHING THEY TEACH AND PREACH HAS WORKED FOR THEM TODAY. THEY GIVE UP A LOT OF PLAYS BUT THEY STIFFEN UP ONCE YOU GET NEAR THE END ZONE. THIS TIME THAT WAS MCPHEE, I THINK, JIM. JIM: YEAH, IT WAS MCPHEE. MCPHEE WAS THE ONE WHO BATTED IT IN THE AIR. AND HOW ABOUT NEW ENGLAND TONIGHT? FIVE TRIPS INSIDE OF BALTIMORE'S 25 AND HAS COME AWAY WITH ONE TOUCHDOWN. ELLERBE CRADLED IT. PHIL: BOY, HE'S GOT THAT CAST ON THAT RIGHT HAND THAT. BALL ALMOST CAME THROUGH BUT WHAT A GOOD JOB. HE KNEW IT. THAT'S WHY HE CRADLED IT. JIM: WELL, THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK JIM: JUST DOUBLE CHECKING HERE THAT ELLERBE HAD THE CLEAN CATCH OF THE INTERCEPTION. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT. AND HERE'S A NEW ENGLAND TEAM THAT HAD THIS -- REFEREE: AFTER REVIEW OF THE PLAY, THE RULING ON THE FIELD IS CONFIRMED, INTERCEPTION. JIM: PATRIOTS ARE PLUS-25 IN THE TURNOVER DEPARTMENT THIS YEAR. AND THERE YOU SEE THE OWNER OF THE RAVENS. DICK CASS IN THE WHITE SHIRT TOO, THE PRESIDENT. TONIGHT THE PATRIOTS TWO DOWN IN THE TAKEAWAY MARGIN. THAT'S RICE FOR ONE. WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE WAY THE RAVENS ARE HITTING THE PATRIOTS TONIGHT AND AS BALTIMORE BOARD ITS PLANE LAST NIGHT TO FLY UP HERE, JOHN HARBAUGH GOT A TEXT FROM THE CHAMP, FROM MUHAMMAD ALI, WHO VISITED WITH THIS TEAM BEFORE WEEK ONE. HE SENT ALONG AN INSPIRATIONAL MESSAGE TO THIS TEAM AND TOLD THEM IF I HAD WINGS I WOULD FLY TO NEW ENGLAND. I'LL BE THINKING OF YOU GUYS. PHIL: WELL, WE SAID EARLIER THEY WERE VERY CALM LAST NIGHT, NOT REAL EMOTIONAL ABOUT TODAY'S GAME. JIM: SECOND AND 9, RICE. HE GETS TOSSED DOWN ABOUT A YARD SHORT OF THE FIRST. NOBODY KNOWS THE GAME LIKE A QUARTERBACK. BREAKDOWN BOTH CHAMPIONSHIPS TOMORROW ON &quot;NFL MONDAY Q.B..&quot; PHIL WILL BE THERE TO TALK ABOUT IT. 6:30 ONLY ON CBS SPORTS NETWORK, 24-HOUR HOME OF CBS SPORTS. PHIL: JOE FLACCO, GOOD, SOLID GAME. THREE TOUCHDOWNS NO, INTERCEPTIONS. SO WHEN THE OPPORTUNITIES WERE THERE HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THEM. EVERYTHING WE TALK ABOUT THAT NEW ENGLAND OFFENSE. TOM BRADY, 136 YARDS. JIM: NEW ENGLAND'S DEFENSE NEEDS A STOP HERE. THIRD AND 1. RICE DRIVING AHEAD AND HAS THE FIRST. PHIL: HUGE FIRST DOWN FOR THE GAME AND FOR THIS BALTIMORE RAVENS TEAM. RAY RICE JUST STAYS SO LOW. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HE GETS IT. GOOD BLOCK ON THE BACKSIDE BY VONTA LEACH. JIM: AND NINKOVICH SHAKEN UP. THAT FIRST DOWN JUST HUGE, AS WE HAVE 4:40 REMAINING. GIVES THE RAVENS A CHANCE TO, AGAIN, TRY TO SALT THIS AWAY. UP THE MIDDLE, PIERCE. FOR FIVE MORE. PHIL: I WAS WONDERING IF NEW ENGLAND WOULD START USING THEIR TIME-OUTS IN THIS SITUATION RIGHT HERE. THEY'RE GOING TO WAIT A LITTLE LONGER. BUT I THINK BILL BELL CLICK IS GOING TO GIVE IT ONE MORE PLAY TO SEE THE SITUATION BEFORE HE DECIDES TO USE THE TIME-OUTS. JIM: SECOND AND 5. FLACCO WILL LET THE PLAY CLOCK GET DOWN TO FOUR. LEACH. THEY'LL MARK HIM JUST SHY OF THE FIRST. YOU'VE MADE A FEW REFERENCES TO HARBAUGH'S MINDSET COMING INTO THIS GAME. HE SAID LAST NIGHT WE'RE NOT EMOTIONAL. WE HAVE NO AX TO GRIND. WE'RE PAST ALL OF THAT. WE'RE MATURE AND DETERMINED. AND PATRIOTS WILL HAVE TO PLAY GREAT TO BEAT US. THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD US. PHIL: BILL BELICHICK, I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED, JIM, BEFORE I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, THAT THEY DIDN'T USE THEIR TIME-OUTS BUT AGAIN, SINCE IT'S THIRD AND SHORT HE'S GOING TO TRY AND WAIT AND GET THEM IN A THREE-DOWN SITUATION. BUT BALTIMORE NEEDED THAT ONE FIRST DOWN. THEY GOT IT AND THIS ONE IS JUST TO ICE THE GAME. JIM: THERE IT IS. IT'S LEACH FOR THE FIRST. AND I THINK RAY LEWIS IS STARTING TO REALIZE NOW HE CAN PUT THAT RETIREMENT ON HOLD. PHIL: YOU KNOW, SO MANY THINGS HAVE TO COME TOGETHER FOR A FOOTBALL TEAM. YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT THE OFFENSIVE LINE FELL INTO PLACE AT THE START OF THE PLAYOFFS FOR THE BALTIMORE RAVENS. THEY GOT HEALTHY ON THE DEFENSIVE SIDE. THEY GOT A FEW GUYS BACK, ONE OF THEM, OF COURSE, BEING RAY LEWIS. YOU HAVE TO GET HOT IN THE NFL AT THE RIGHT TIME. THE RAVENS GOT HEALTHY AND HOT AT THE END OF THE YEAR. JIM: FIRST AND 10. RICE. HIS OLD RUTGERS TEAMMATE IS THERE -- TO MEET HIM. AND HERE'S THE TIME-OUT CALLED BY NEW ENGLAND. JIM: LOOK AT THAT MARK. HOME RECORD WHEN LEADING AT HALFTIME UNDER BELICHICK, 67-0 WITH TOM BRADY. HOWEVER, THAT 67-0 MARK IS GOING TO HAVE A BLEMISH ON IT AFTER TONIGHT, IT APPEARS. 2:20 TO GO. COMING UP, THE &quot;SUBWAY POSTGAME SHOW&quot; WILL HAVE THE PRESENTATION OF THE LAMARR HUNT TROPHY TO THE A.F.C. CHAMPIONS, PLUS J.B., DAN, SHANNON, BOOMER AND COACH COWHER WILL PREVIEW SUPER BOWL XLVII. IT'S ALL COMING UP ON THE &quot;SUBWAY POSTGAME SHOW.&quot; HERE'S A SECOND AND 10. RICE GOES LOW, DIVES AHEAD FOR THREE. PHIL: WELL, JIM, WE'RE GETTING DOWN TO THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING BUT THE RAVENS DEFENSE DIDN'T GET BLIND BY ALL THE MOTIONS AND BELLS AND WHISTLES OF THE NEW ENGLAND OFFENSE. THEY STAYED IN PLACE AND JUST KEPT HITTING AND TO ME THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIG DIFFERENCES IN THIS GAME. JIM: THIS IS A TEAM, YOU TALK ABOUT ADVERSITY. YOU SAW STEVE BISCIOTTI EARLIER. BECAME THE MINORITY OWNER AND THEN THE MAJORITY OWNER IN 2004. SUGGS WAS LAST YEAR'S NFL DEFENDER OF THE YEAR AND HE WAS OUT TILL MIDSEASON WITH AN ACHILLES INJURY. THEN THEY LOST LEWIS MID OCTOBER WITH A TRICEPS INJURY. THEY HAD AN IMPROBABLE WIN AT SAN DIEGO AND, OF COURSE, THE 70-YARD IMPROBABLE PLAY TO JACOBY JONES AT DENVER, AS RICE IS STOPPED. AND THEY CHANGED OFFENSIVE COORDINATORS LATE IN THE SEASON AS THE PATRIOTS TAKE THEIR LAST TIME-OUT. ALL OF THESE LITTLE MOMENTS THAT TEST AND YOU TEST, AGAIN, THE MOXIE OF A FOOTBALL TEAM. BUT WE WERE THERE THAT FIRST WEEK OF THE PLAYOFFS GOING AGAINST INDIANAPOLIS AND WE WALKED OUT OF A FRIDAY MEETING AT THAT FACILITY AND YOU SAID YOU KNOW WHAT, AS YOU SEE HARBAUGH COME OVER TO FLACCO. THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE IT NOW. WE WERE SAYING THERE IS SOMETHING HERE THAT IS VERY DYNAMIC AND THEY ARE CHARGED AND READY. OR AS FLACCO TOLD US, WE'RE READY TO EXPLODE. PHIL: I THINK YOU NEEDED A VERSETY ON A FOOTBALL TEAM. THEY HAD THEIR SHARE OF IT WITH INJURIES AND WHEN THEY WENT DOWN AND GOT PUMMELED BY THE HOUSTON TEXANS, IT MADE THEM RESHAPE DURING THEIR BYE WEEK AND THEN THEY HAD SOME STRUGGLES AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IT TOUGHENED THEM UP FOR THIS PLAYOFF RUN AND SOME BIG PLAYS AT THE RIGHT TIME. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE TOUGH FOOTBALL TEAM WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE RAVENS. JIM: BOY, HE HAD PRESSURE. AND THIS ONE GOES OUT OF BOUNDS. PAST THE 30. IT'S BEEN 12 SEASONS SINCE THE RAVENS WERE IN THE SUPER BOWL IN THE FIFTH YEAR OF EXISTENCE. THERE'S, OF COURSE, SOME OF THE ACTION THAT HAPPENED AGAINST THE GIANTS. BALTIMORE WON THE GAME 34-7 DOWN IN TAMPA. JERMAINE LEWIS HAD THAT 84-YARD KICK RETURN FOR A TOUCHDOWN. RAY LEWIS WAS THE M.V.P. THERE'S MR. MODELL, WHO PASSED AWAY ON SEPTEMBER 6. FIRST DOWN, BRADY. WORKS THE SIDELINE TO BRANCH. AND JOHN HARBAUGH SAID WAIT A MINUTE, YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT PLAY TOOK LIKE THREE SECONDS? PHIL: I DON'T BLAME HIM. I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HAPPY EITHER. JIM: GIVES THE PATRIOTS AN EXTRA PLAY AND BRADY HIT WHEN JIM: COMING UP, THE &quot;SUBWAY POSTGAME SHOW&quot; WILL HAVE THE PRESENTATION OF THE LAMARR HUNT ROAF TO THE A.F.C. CHAMPIONS. WE'LL HAVE THE FIRST PREVIEW OF SUPER BOWL XLVII COMING UP ON THE &quot;SUBWAY POSTGAME SHOW.&quot; SECOND AND 10 FOR BRADY AND THE PATRIOTS, WITHOUT ANY TIME-OUTS. AND THAT'S A FIRST DOWN BY WELKER AT THE 45. AND THEY'LL STOP IT RIGHT THERE. PHIL: THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. OF COURSE, THIS DEFENSE, YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S NOT OVER. YOU NEVER KNOW. THEY NEED, OF COURSE, TWO TOUCHDOWNS AND A TWO-POINT CONVERSION. ONE TWO-POINT CONVERSION. BUT JUST TACKLE THEM INBOUNDS. JIM: AND ALL OF THIS WITHOUT ANY TIME-OUTS. WOODHEAD SMARTLY GOES OUT OF BOUNDS. BACK-TO-BACK 12-YARD PLAYS. PHIL: IF YOU'RE THE RAVENS, PROTECT THE SIDELINES. BE DEEP DOWN THE FIELD, PROTECT THE SIDELINES. DON'T LET THEM GET OUT OF BOUNDS. JIM: BRADY HAS TO FLIP IT AWAY UNDER PRESSURE. SUGGS IN ON HIM. PHIL: I THINK YOU'VE SAID, JIM, EVERY TIME THEY PLAY SUGGS FINDS A WAY TO GET A BIG HIT OR BIG PLAY AGAINST TOM BRADY. HE'S ON NATE SOLDER ON THE LEFT SIDE. WHAT A GOOD JUMP AT THE SNAP OF THE FOOTBALL. JIM: 1:36 TO GO. AGAIN DEFLECTED AT THE LINE. MIGHT HAVE BEEN MCPHEE ONE MORE TIME. PHIL: THEY'RE JUST GOING AND TRYING TO PUSH STRAIGHT. WATCHING TOM BRADY IT'S ALMOST LIKE -- MCPHEE, LIKE WHAT J.J. WATT DOES IN HOUSTON. HE READS THE QUARTERBACK'S EYES AND TIMES THE TIME TO JUMP. JIM: THAT'S TWO. WE THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE HAD ANOTHER ONE AS WELL. THIRD AND 10. HERNANDEZ. HE FIGHTS FOR THAT FIRST DOWN. PHIL: GOT TO BE CAREFUL THEY DON'T FAKE SPIKE IT AND TRY AND THROW ONE DOWN THE FIELD. JIM: NEW ENGLAND NOW WITH ITS SIXTH TRIP INSIDE THE RAVENS' 25. THE PATRIOTS HAVE BEEN BLANKED HERE IN THE SECOND HALF 21-0. PHIL: HARD TO BELIEVE. THE HIGHEST SCORING OFFENSE IN THE NFL BY 100 POINTS. JIM: BRADY THROWS AND HE'S INTERCEPTED IN THE END ZONE! CARY WILLIAMS ICES IT AND BALTIMORE IS HEADING TO NEW ORLEANS! PHIL: PLAYING THE SITUATION. CARY WILLIAMS PLAYS IT. THE WIND COMING ACROSS THE FIELD. HE PLAYS IT GREAT. HE LETS HIM GO BY TO THE INSIDE SO HE CAN'T GET OUT OF BOUNDS AND THEN UNDERCUTS THE THROW. JIM: SUPER BOWL XLVII IS GOING TO HAVE ONE OF THE GREAT STORIES THERE'S EVER BEEN IN THAT GAME. TWO BROTHERS ON OPPOSITE SIDELINES. PHIL: WHAT DID JOHN HARBAUGH SAY TO US LAST NIGHT ABOUT HIS PARENTS, WHO WILL BE HOME WATCHING BOTH CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES TODAY? JIM: THEY'VE BEEN AGONIZING THROUGH ALL OF THIS. BACK AT HOME ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MILWAUKEE. WATCHING THEIR SONS, BOTH OF WHOM LOST ON CHAMPIONSHIP SUNDAY LAST YEAR. BOTH WIN TODAY. AS STEVE BISCIOTTI, THE OWNER, HUGS RAY LEWIS. RAY LEWIS EXTENDS HIS CAREER BY TWO WEEKS. THEY'LL BE GIVEN THE TROPHY BY THEIR SENIOR ADVICOR OF PLAYER DEVELOPMENT, O.J., WHO WAS ON THE SUPER BOWL TEAM IN 2000, IS BATTLING A.L.S. HE'LL BE IN THE LOCKER ROOM TO BE A PART OF THE CEREMONY THAT'S COMING UP. ABSOLUTE SECOND-HALF DOMINANCE BY BALTIMORE. WE TALKED AT THE TOP ABOUT SAME TIME, SAME PLACE. THIS YEAR, DIFFERENT RESULT. PHIL: JOHN HARBAUGH SAID A LOT OF LONG DAYS AND A QUICK YEAR AND HERE THEY ARE AGAIN. JIM: AND HOW ABOUT FLAK SNOWE PHIL: JOE FLACCO, THREE TOUCHDOWNS TODAY, NO INTERCEPTIONS. SO MANY PEOPLE QUESTIONED CAN HE WIN THE BIG GAME, THE BIG MOMENT? ALL THE PRESSURE WAS ON HIM. YOU KNOW WHAT JIM, THEY PUT THE FOOTBALL IN HIS HANDS THERE IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND HE TOOK THEM DOWN TWICE FOR TOUCHDOWNS AND I THINK HE ANSWERED THE QUESTION TO A LOT OF HIS CRITICS. JIM: TOM BRADY AND THE PATRIOTS TURNED IT OVER THREE TIMES IN THAT SECOND HALF. YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN OUT IN FRONT OF THIS FLACCO STORY AND HIS ABILITY FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO JUMP ONBOARD. YOU NEVER UNDERSTOOD FOR SEVERAL YEARS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE WERE SO CRITICAL OF HIM. LAST YEAR HE PLAYED SO WELL HERE IN A LOSING EFFORT AND TONIGHT JUST OUTSTANDING AS COACH BELICHICK AND THE PATRIOTS HEAD INSIDE, THEIR SEASON OVER. PHIL: FLACCO PLAYS ON AN OFFENSE THAT'S NOT QUARTERBACK-FRIENDLY SOMETIMES. THEY MAKE HIM MAKE A LOT OF DEMANDING THROWS BUT TODAY, ESPECIALLY IN THE SECOND HALF, THEY GAVE HIM SOME UNDERNEATH THROWS AND HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT. &gt;&gt; WHAT A SEASON WE'VE HAD. WHAT A SEASON WE'VE HAD. YOU WON THAT GAME. JIM: SO YOUR SUPER BOWL MATCHUP IN TWO WEEKS' TIME. THE BALTIMORE RAVENS AND THE SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS. WOW. PHIL: BROTHERS COACHING AGAINST EACH OTHER IN THE SUPER BOWL. IT ALMOST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE BALTIMORE 28, NEW ENGLAND 13. COMING UP NEXT, THE &quot;SUBWAY POSTGAME SHOW.&quot; FOR PHIL SIMMS, STEVE TASKER, SOLOMON WILCOTS, THIS IS JIM NANTZ SAYING SO LONG FOR NOW FROM
