- Welcome back to and I'm proud to say this (slow music) - Wow! You don't wanna miss that. (upbeat music) Hidden door. (upbeat music) I'm so shocked right now. - Just wait until you see the galley. - Look at these engines. (slow upbeat music) (upbeat music) - Welcome aboard this 130 feet, and it has so many cool, unique features. All right we're gonna start on our- Swim platform. Okay. - Welcome aboard. - [Rico] So, yeah. Well, that's the swim platform. (Rico and Victoria laughing) - So what I like is they - [Rico] Yes. - Which is pretty cool. There are some pop-up cleats here which are not good to hold this boat but they are great for fenders. - [Rico] Fenders or the tender. - Or also being able to inflatable swim platforms behind. - Definitely. Something to think about right now because we don't really have that. - [Rico] We need to have some - Because how do we attach that thing if you wanna put it there? Yeah, you're right. You're right. Look at list. - You're right. - [Rico] Anyway, so moving back here, we have the main shore power, and that is here. We have two cable wheels here. This is pretty cool. Look at this, how this is incorporated here, like molded in really, Nicely protected. - [Victoria] Agreed. - [Rico] And then this on top here, SP1 and SP2. That is this shore power. - [Victoria] What's this? - [Rico] I don't know - [Victoria] It almost looks - [Rico] Maybe. Two big bullets. One bullet, one cap stand, another one on the port side. - Okay, full disclosure, you guys. It's some crazy weather going around us. That's what I love about filming boats is when you get on board, all the crew is like, &quot;The radar, we've got three And sure enough, three minutes. Like they're watching the So what we're gonna do is and we're gonna start on our top deck, show you that, and come down deck by deck real quick. - Yup. and then go on the inside - [Rico] What I love about bigger boats and bigger yachts in general, like proper super yachts, you have these staircases - Yeah, it's very, very grand. It looks amazing. It's gonna be high. I'm - Let's go. (gentle music) All right, let's start - [Rico] Did we mention that - Yes, one of the reasons being is that there is crazy weather and there is a pretty good chance that we will get huge shower. It was drizzling in between and we just decided let's start up here. Let's show this to you before it's pouring cats And yeah, let's start at the good stuff. Saving best for first. - [Rico] Saving... Well, we're not saving anything. It's right here. Actually, we have a little bit of a lake. But now you can see how the - So, we have a hot tub here. There's a really cool kind all the way around that when other people are in the hot tub. - [Rico] How cool is this spot? If you do some very calm - Yeah. - [Rico] And you actually have and you sit in there going. - And just waving it. People going by. - Yeah, pretty- - [Rico] What'd they say? Decadent? - Decadent. - [Rico] Ah, yeah. - I think it's quite let's say at the Anchorage, you're pretty high up. So a lot of other boats So it feels quite a bit private here. - [Rico] That's a good point, yeah. Instead of having the - Can you hear the thunder? - Can you guys hear the thunder? - [Rico] Yeah, I'm still when you are stern two in the Caribbean or in Europe, this is definitely pretty nice, yeah. - Yes, it's for sure very private. All right, let's go quickly - [Rico] Okay, what do we - So there's a little bit of There's a sink, double sink. Look how deep this is. That's nice. Can actually... Can even like ice some bottles here. We have drink fridges, drawers, and some storage underneath. - [Rico] Hang on. I wanna show you something. - What? - [Rico] Can you open the I was just thinking like, how do they make sure this Right? - [Rico] Yeah, how do they make sure that this doesn't come out underway? - Oh, they have a pin here. - [Rico] They have a pin - What? - [Victoria] No way. - [Rico] Yes way. So this pin just goes in here. - I love it. - [Rico] And it's secured. - That's brilliant. - [Rico] How cool is that? - [Victoria] Brilliant. - [Rico] And you don't see it. They even have this here, these little hooky, so they don't... You know? - Create a lot of noise. - Yeah. - Oh, wow. - [Rico] Very innovative. - Cool stuff. Little details. All about the details. All right, let's go aft here. - [Rico] And for all we opened too many things, we wouldn't have seen this if - Okay, let's go. - [Rico] So what do we have here? - Let's go up, all the way up. - [Rico] All the way up? We are all the way up. Nope, there's more. We have a little ladder We have our electronics Big... Oh, there's more. I got to show this to you guys. - [Victoria] Be careful in your socks. - [Rico] I'm careful, I'm careful. Look at this guys. There are kayaks and I think all the way on top nicely covered. Right underneath the radar, there's a six-foot... Oh, sorry. No, I think That's a 10-foot radar, I think. Furuno radar which is right up there. We got another CCTV camera This is pretty cool. Well used storage space. - So we also have some And really nice sitting area right here which can easily accommodate maybe even six. But this is a really large furniture. So technically, if you into being able to accommodate more people or having a table here, you could easily do that. - [Rico] Yeah. I mean, it's all loose furniture, right? - And there's still a bit more storage on our starboard side. - [Rico] Well, not just storage alone. - We think there's more there? - [Rico] There's a popup TV there. - Oh, you are right. TV is right here. Yeah. - [Rico] And enough - For sure. Yeah, you need storage for the covers. This is interesting. I've never seen this before. And we kinda did the NBBL new boat build list, our new boat build list. This is very interesting. - [Rico] The covers for the life raft. - Yeah, life rafts are here on both sides, and they are covered. I don't know if they are always covered. But at least when the boat is sitting, it's covered which is great. - [Rico] I think when the at least they're covered, right? To keep them out of the sun. - Yeah, so it just protects them. - [Rico] It protects them, yeah. Underway, they're probably - Really cool. - Yeah. (upbeat music) So we are on our boat - [Rico] Bridge deck, boat deck, exactly. - All right, let's start aft Please don't rain on us. Please don't rain us. - So as you guys can see, in the floor we have all over the place these integrated receptacles all over the place for a shock system. So, you can be completely flexible. - [Victoria] You can - You can be very shocked, yeah. Very shocked. I'm so shocked right now. You have these shocks which and you can move them over here if you wanna to have some jet skis behind or you leave that there. Put some jet ski shocks over here. Whatever it is, a second tender, there's lots of opportunities. - [Victoria] Is that - Yes. Speaking of the tender, it's an 18.5 tender on here which is probably the biggest unless you go length. - [Victoria] Yeah. - And not diagonal. So we have a very large with the base over there. I like the way it's positioned actually. It's really out of the way. So if the tenders are in the water or all your toys are in the water, you have this massive which is really cool. Workout. Like they have here. And this basically outdoor gym, it's a really, really cool space. And you have a little bit of a bar here. Actually a lot of a bar. Electric barbecue right here. - [Rico] Electric grill. - Electric grill, sorry. Storage underneath. More drink refrigeration. Drawers. Love it. Again, same double sink here. Same kind of a layout and What's that? Actually there's more workout equipment. - Oh look, there's weights. Oh yeah, so they definitely What a nice place to work out. - [Rico] Or this could be the party deck. - True. Speaking of a party deck, should we go all the way forward? - [Rico] Sure. - I have something very special there. - [Rico] Special? - Yeah. Follow me. - [Rico] Side decks? - No. - [Rico] Beautiful overhang again? - Yes. - [Rico] Keeps you out of the rain. Got our pilot house port side door here. Here we have a wing station. - Which we can come back to if you want, unless you wanna do it now. - Okay, all right. I like when you volunteer. - So, open this up. - [Victoria] You guys know When Rico is volunteering that's usually when he (Victoria laughs) He would be a really bad poker player. That's his tell. - Maybe. I would be like... - [Victoria] Okay, Captain. Let's go. Exactly, that's you. Looks at these cards. - [Victoria] Exactly. - All in. - [Victoria] Not very good. Not very good at hiding. - Anyway, so really, I like that they really into the bulwarks. Everything you need pretty We have our rudder indicator, we have bow and stern thruster here, our start, stop buttons, emergency stop buttons shift throttle control, and then our rudder control right here. All you need for docking. - And let's check it out. Here. Great visibility. Great visibility. - [Victoria] Oh yeah, you could see every- - All along. So, let's carefully close it again. - [Victoria] I've never seen Nicely protected as well. - Beautiful. - [Victoria] All right. - Beautiful. And I'll show you something special. - [Rico] Oh, something special. Oh, what's going on here? - I don't know. Cigar lounge. Sundowners. - [Rico] Wow. - It's a really cool space. Didn't expect it, huh? - [Rico] No. - Yeah. It's so cute. I love it. I think I would use it all the time, especially in the Anchorage Of course, it's raining now. - [Rico] Yeah. - Especially in Anchorage because that's where you So you would spend a lot of time here because sometimes aft is - I agree. all this breeze and the rain. - [Rico] Well, another thing, even if everybody is or whatever they're doing, the crew can also take advantage of that. - That's a very good point. So you have a little Okay. - [Rico] So let's turn around a little bit and make sure we don't get I just wanna show people. So let's go forward quicker. - [Rico] So we have another - Yes, how cute. Like this is very grand. - [Rico] So I'm gonna go this way. - And unique. You don't really see this often. It feels a little bit of like - [Rico] It does. It does. Not that I've ever been to prom. - When you pick up your prom she comes down here. - [Rico] Really cool. (Victoria laughs) - I love it. - It's so pretty. - [Rico] So I guess that's - Yes, so there's another space. So you really have these two decks, which is unusual. You don't see it all the time. And they've really made it... You can also say guest-friendly space. So even if you are anchor in here, you could still hang out and kind of observe the crew and watch. And you know, it's just But yes, for sure. Crew can actually take a break there. - [Rico] It's a really nice spot. Definitely. So then of course, we have pocket anchors. Two dual anchors. Windless right here. Cap stands or a bell. - Oh, the bell. - [Rico] The bell. - [Rico] Okay, you wanna ring the bell? - Well, the captain seemed really nice, so I think he's not gonna mind. (bell rings) - That's a bell. - That's a good bell. - [Rico] Yeah. That's a good bell. We have an access hatch Chain locker? - Chain locker. - [Victoria] Yeah. - [Rico] What's that? - I don't know. What is that? - Oh. - [Victoria] Oh, it's a big storage. - Big storage. - Very cool. for the anchors. - Yes. - [Victoria] These are massive remotes. - Yup. - [Victoria] Wow. You know you're in a big boat when you have this kind of remotes. - Really cool. - Okay, shall we run - Yes. - Okay, and it's nice. Look, you can actually I love how this is flared out. The bulwarks have flared out. - [Rico] Like a lot. - A lot. And it gives this feel when you're here in a bow. - [Rico] Very true. Very true. and very, very tall. - Yes. when you're here. it's helping obviously in heavy as best as possible. So, you don't have too much of a wet ride. (upbeat music plays) - So we're gonna show (upbeat music continues) Come on in. Welcome to our bridge. Okay, quick rundown- - [Rico] Oh, wow. - Before we text over the bridge. So, it's actually a really nice size. You have the separate - [Rico] Chart table. - Chart table or first mate space. You know, to be able to do all the work you need to do extra. And then still a large, large bench here. You can easily hang out - [Rico] Oh, for sure. - It's big. Very big. - [Rico] Yeah. Yeah, no, this is great. - [Rico] Yeah, because - Yeah. Oh, it's great underway. No, this is great for longer crossings and the longer journeys in general. You know, if the crew or you're just doing a shift change. - Run through the bridge. - [Rico] Run through the bridge. - See what you know. - I like that watch, that clock. - [Victoria] Yeah, what's - Yeah, I don't know. I definitely wanna have - [Victoria] Yeah? - [Rico] Yes. - [Victoria] Anything else? - So we have two helm chairs. Look at this wheel. - [Victoria] Ah, that's beautiful. - And look at all these inlays. That is some beautiful - [Victoria] Yeah, you're - No, we're not gonna have that. But for the classic look, the way the helm is laid out here and designed with the wood, it looks beautiful. - [Victoria] The woodwork You just wait. I mean, you see it here a little bit, but as we go deeper into the guest spaces, you see how beautiful. You will notice. - [Victoria] It's really gorgeous. - Anyways, little bit of fomo right now. They have five screens. We only have four. - [Victoria] Oh, stop. How big are their screens? - That's looks like 24s. Oh my god, they're massive. - So yeah, we are gonna - [Victoria] No, these - There's five screens here. One is used right now for CCTV cameras and it looks like there's more But right now this is what's chosen. We have our alarms monitor here or that's the screen dedicated for the alarm monitoring system. Get a chart here which is time zero. Separate system right on this screen and more CCTV cameras - [Victoria] Well, - Of course, we have our shift for the main engines which we will see at the end of the tour. And please believe me when You'll wanna see that. - [Victoria] Are we not gonna - No. - [Victoria] Oh, come on. - No, stay till the end of the video. - [Victoria] Oh, come on. - We will see in the engine - They are... No, I'm just kidding. - These are probably the biggest engines on that size vessel we have filmed. Let's see. Let's see. We'll take a look at it. So we have our remotes port engine, main engine remotes, our bow and stern thruster, rudder joystick, steering computer. Rudder indicator right there. Windshield wiper control right here. - [Victoria] Is steering computer a thing? Is that a real term? - Well, it's a steering control. Steering control. Not steering but steering control. - [Victoria] Steering control. Okay. - [Victoria] All right, just checking. - This is beautiful here. This is very beautiful. - [Victoria] What is very beautiful? Oh no. - I'm so tempted right now. So tempted right now. - Anyways, this is the with the presets. - [Victoria] God you get - Which we will have So as you guys can see, a single blast, double blast, then you have all the presets. For moving a stern, for example, three short blasts. So you have a lot of Like one is also really which is five short blasts. So instead of... Really, if you're in that situation where you need to use that sound signal, it's a lot easier if you can just press it and it does it by itself. - Exactly one button. You press it one time You can pay attention to What's going on around you. - [Victoria] Would it be correct to say that after the sound system the second most exciting is the horn? Is that, &quot;Eh, time's up&quot;? - I mean, there are a lot but the horn is definitely one of them. - [Victoria] No, horn - I just can't wait to hear it. - [Victoria] To keep blasting the danger. - No, not that. No, no. - I don't ever wanna - [Victoria] This is huge. - We have our autopilot control here, our compass which is- - [Victoria] Very large. - Looks like somebody polished it all day. [Victoria] Yeah, it's beautiful. - And of course, VHF radios, So let's not make it too long because we have a lot more boat to go through. A lot more boat. - [Rico] You know what, maybe for our NBBL list. - What? Yeah, I saw that. It's great. I love it as well. - [Rico] There is an - I love it as well. I Putting on the list. - [Rico] Outlet under the table. - NBBL. Okay. - And we are walking our upper salon. - [Rico] Wow, this is gorgeous. - This is where you really get to feel and see that timeless the woodwork. This space is so nice. The one thing Rico and I noticed, the owners that end up they can't go back, right? Like they just love All right, so we'll start here. So we have a little There is a drink fridge, a bit of storage. And this is kind of neat. Look, they actually left this as a window. So it allows for a lot more And this feels really nice and bright. So we have a card table here set for four. There is loose furniture sofa here. Can easily hang out here Can even do like a couple poofs if you wanted to expand the space, but it's a really nice space. But there is something really So we also have... It's set up to be able to have which a lot of the owners in They are still working usually. And you know, this just is nice to take a phone call, to have a space private. - [Rico] Lots of people work remotely now and lots of people which work So now I'm looking at this background, it's awesome. - [Rico] It's a perfect with a little library behind you. - You will never know where you are at all. - Nobody will ever guess - [Rico] I love it. I wanna do the Zoom calls, you know? - Okay, so we do have a head here, a little day head which is nice. You've got a sink. You've got a toilet. And this is the coolest part. There is a way to make You have a huge pocket door comes in and you can also use it as You don't have a shower - [Rico] Wow. - So if you really wanted to, you could. You could do that. - [Rico] Well, I'm just thinking if you wanna have a second owner's cabin, you could also get rid of Make it a massive shower. - You could. - You know? - [Rico] And make this a second master. - Yeah, I mean, you'll lose this space. But if you want another cabin, you could totally do that. - [Rico] Yeah. - There's all the plumbing - Okay. - [Rico] So going down one deck, but on the exterior. - Yup. And there's something outside that I think we forgot to show you. - [Rico] We did? - Yeah. Rico missed a TV. - Oh no, I did. Yeah, TV lift. - All right. - [Rico] Down to the main deck. - Let's do it. Oh, you can also close this up. This is awesome. - [Rico] Yup. - That's great. - [Rico] So if you have you just close it up. - I love that. Okay, let's go down. - [Rico] Still hear thunder. - Yeah, it's still here. It's not gone. All right, and we are to this really beautiful aft deck . - [Rico] Well, we got just a small, small, small little glance earlier. - Yeah, we just ran through. So now we can actually show you. - [Rico] So, what do we have here? - Large sofa here and if you want to be to sit with more people. But yeah, it's set up. We easily have a nice... I feel like if everything on it feels really nice to hang out. - [Rico] Very comfortable. Actually, 10/10 too. - Well, you can. I'm just saying right now it's set up to be like six to eight. - [Rico] Yeah. - But you can absolutely make it a 10. This is your Alfresco dining. It's set up for eight very comfortably. And like Rico said, you could go bigger. And here we have an actual bar, a dedicated bar with And we have double sink. Same exact mirror set up. Same sink as we saw upstairs We have drink fridges. I mean, they just matched in every deck which is a big check mark. You don't ever have to run up for a drink or for service. You can set everything up. It's all in the same area. It's pretty awesome. They have your little things here. I love them. It's so cool. - [Rico] Yup, the little... And what I really like is the cabinetry on the interior. - Yeah, it's all nicely, nicely - The doors, right? - [Rico] Yeah, another thing which is obviously not the happiest thing for the crew because in the butt to clean, but having this glass here is actually... It comes in really, really handy. If it would be open, like right now we had the shower, you would not be able to do any service from where you're standing right now. With the glass, you and you can just keep going - Yeah, we can close up that deck above us so there's no water coming And this whole space, we - [Rico] Speaking of that entertaining, there's another TV above you. - Oh yeah, right there. Very cool. - And if needed, they way this deck you can absolutely You can easily put a soft enclosure if you wanted to. Sure, absolutely. in cruising some colder climates. - [Rico] Yeah. - I don't think you'll but you could. Okay, let's pop in. I wanna show you the side deck. We already went all the way forward but I wanna show you these 'cause there's proper weather doors here. - [Rico] Weather wind doors, yeah. - Very nice. - [Rico] So that makes especially underway. And if you wanna continue you close these guys up. - Yup. - [Rico] The wind stops which makes a big difference. - A 100%, yeah. - So just wanted to show you the... We were forward already. You guys remember we were talking about how flared out the side Just wanna show you this space. So, it's really nicely protected. Great overhang. I mean, this is a super yacht feel. Like there's no doubt this - [Rico] And for yacht, the size, it's actually kind of unusual to have full walk-around on the main deck. Usually, it's going up and over. - Yup. - Exactly. - [Rico] Most of the vessel of this size. So this is kinda unique actually to have the ability to on the main decks. you're able to go do that. That's really, really cool. - [Rico] Yeah, this makes it very easy for fender placement as well. You don't need to lower - Absolutely. Yes, we don't see it - [Rico] So where are we going? - So beep, beep, beep. We are gonna go into our salon now. - Can't wait. Just wait until you see the galley. I'm a big fan. All right, real quick.

And all of those are writing you guys are the best. All right, let's go Okay, welcome to the salon. - Wow. Look at all the woodwork. I mean, it's just impeccable. It's so beautiful. And I love how they just kind of that a bit of a contrast and then gives that timeless feel. 'Cause I feel like if the you would feel a little bit 2000s. - [Rico] Yes. - But this really has this timeless vibe. You know, very classic. - [Rico] Very classic interior. - Same thing here. Look, they did the same They just kind of split it, but also nice 'cause it allows to have that extra light coming through. - [Rico] Can't have enough windows. - So this looks like a bit of a bar here. Yup, that's a bar. Nice to have. Yeah, all the glassware here. - [Rico] I like how all have the cover over. - Yeah, very nice. - [Rico] So here on the starboard side, we have a pop up TV right there. - [Victoria] Oh, wow. - [Rico] With the flowers on top. - Yeah, it's big. A little car table here as well. So you have one up on in our sky lounge. Come on here. - Count the coffee table let's say the four of you, right? Or the two of you, you're probably not I mean, I wouldn't use the big - Yeah, if this would be space you'd like, I know you kinda like this. - [Rico] I probably sit outside. - You're like a bistro guy. - [Rico] I'm bistro guy. - You actually will not even sit down. You'll just stand. - [Rico] I'll probably move (Victoria and Rico laugh) - Anyway, here is... Oh, I thought it was thunder. - [Rico] I thought it was thunder. (Rico laughs) - Okay. So, we have a sofa here. Good for three. So sitting for five here. This is also nice. There's an ottoman. There's a loose chair. I mean, this place's space is massive.

Look, I'm 6'8&quot; and I'm I mean, I'm not 6'8&quot;. But with my arm up, I'm 6'8&quot;. I'm 5'7&quot;. Victoria's actually very tall. You guys might not know, she's 6'8&quot;. - No, but my arm all the way up, we've measured because to tell you the real height, and it's 6'8&quot; and I can't So, it is really tall. - [Rico] Even the doll - Agreed.

And this shower, this actually feels bigger. - [Rico] Does it? - Yeah, it's definitely a Yeah, great size. - [Rico] Also, a rain shower head, right? - Very nice. Love it. Okay, now we're gonna go and which has a little surprise. So, it's exactly the same. Just about, right? Let's check out the head first. Yeah, I would say mirror image. Pretty much identical. Same. Beautiful. Wow, this board holes are gorgeous. - [Rico] Board holes are beautiful, huh? - Yes. And then we have this little... What do you call this? - [Rico] Nightstand. - I mean, yeah.

That doesn't work. - [Rico] Hidden door. - What? - [Rico] So, you got a hidden door here. - Yes. - [Rico] And then we do have So this is the watertight so we can go through here. Normally, it would be closed. So that brings you and directly into the crew laundry. - Yes, so you have... This is basically a service When it guests are up on they can go and service this cabins and just disappear into this spot. Really cool. You don't need to carry all the laundry, all the sheets. Everything just gets put in right here. Really Awesome. Really cool to have that. So yes, they have two sets of professional Miele washer and dryers. And we're coming into our crew mess. - [Rico] Which is extremely tidy. So, it's like quite - Yes, it's not a mess. But it's a nice size actually. So the boat is run with six crew.

All of this is storage, draw fridges right here, a microwave. Yeah, it's a nice space. And we actually can show 'cause crew is pretty cool on this boat and they are letting us show to you. So, quickly pop in. We're not gonna open anything. Respect their privacy. So this is technically So you'll have a single bed here, but it's much wider. It's like a extra twin, I think. It's called excel twin. It's like a bigger single bed. Theoretically, it could for some time. Yes, definitely. - [Rico] Like a couple. - Look, there's a lot of storage. Actually, a lot. I don't- - [Rico] That is one of the reasons why the bed is so high up. - Wow. - [Rico] One reason, of course, it's because the bow already flares in so it's higher up but also underneath. - [Rico] A lot, yeah. - I mean, there are lots of drawers and there's still like and all of this. This is a lot of storage. And we can quickly look into - [Rico] Oh, I see. - [Victoria] It's a separate shower. - [Rico] Very comfortable. - [Victoria] Yeah. - [Rico] Walk-in shower. - And then let's go show you So there must be some more And their matching cabin is here.

And you're really out of each other's way. This part can also be used a bit as a stew's pantry if needed. You know, for service. So you have a little bit of space here and the chef is still have - [Rico] So, you got a wine fridge. - Exactly. And then here we have an ice maker. - [Rico] Wow, huge ice maker.

Now you're wondering why The day head is right here. Well, the current owner for the owner suite. Since the main en suite only has one head, has two vanities but has only one head, so he created this here, a separation door. We can close the door to the galley. And now... Hi, toilet. - Now it's a private head. It's actually the secondary - [Victoria] Very interesting. - Yes. - [Victoria] That was his - He made it work.

Okay, walking into our owner suite. So what Rico pointed out earlier is that this model is not full beam. You have this like full walk around decks. The owner suite, because So it's a bit narrow that sometimes we see on the size of this boat. But I think they resolved it quite well. And I don't necessarily feel that it's...
