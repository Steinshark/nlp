- The limiting factor on can stay submerged is the crew's stomach. A U.S. Navy nuclear that allows it to stay submerged for an incredible amount of time. It can make its own freshwater. It can even generate its own air, and the reactor that generates the power to sustain these systems but it can't grow food. So what do they do? This is the next video Deep Dive series in And we're about to get a at how food is stored, on a U. S. fast attack nuclear as it operates under the Today, we're gonna talk who's in charge of cooking all the meals, but first we're going to Mike, otherwise known as responsible for acquiring and storing all provisions on board. - So this is my freezer. - [Destin] So this is your freezer. - Yep. This is, I'm accountable for So this is how we store the majority of our - Dude, it is cold. I guess it's a freezer, but holy cow, look at all this meat. Is that like a whole What is that? - Yep, so we've got some We've got some prime ribs back there. We've got a lot of chicken. We got a lot of chicken pucks, which are essentially chicken nuggets, chicken We've got fish. We've got mozzarella sticks, We've got jalapeno poppers. We've got a ton of bacon. - So how long can you, how much Like how long can this last? Well, is that, are you allowed to tell me? - I am required to maintain and I have to be able to load up to about nine zero - [Destin] Really? - Yep, so we are gettin' for quite a long while. We get roughly $10.60 a day per person, to feed three meals. - Right, your home port - It is, yes. - So are you always purchasing food there? Or like if you're, if you - Nope, we order food based off of where in the world So if we pull into a base in Spain, then I'm gonna be ordering which is not always the same. So that comes up with I have to tweak my menu, so that it can support the in whatever port we go to. - This crew loves Carolina We can't get that back home, so before we, you know we'll load up on Carolina 'cause we'll make the crew happy. So we have to think ahead and, you know base our menu based on what we can get from the - How many ports do you have to hit, before you kind of like - It generally takes a few ports. I've been on board for So it's, you know I have a good feeling of what the crew likes and doesn't like, so it was a little bit easier to do. So next time we pull up to a foreign port, I would be looking at that and makin' sure we get from there, what we can't get from home. - [Destin] So, do they let you guys know, when they don't like the food? - Oh yes, oh yes. Real quick. - This is dry storage. - [Destin] Dry storage. What? Can I walk in? - Yeah, yes. - Hi, I'm Tyler Sokane. - [Destin] I'm Destin, - Pleasure to meet you. - [Destin] I've noticed Am I seeing that right? - [Tyler] Cocoa powder. - [Destin] How do you - Me personally, I'll walk out 'Cause I put it out, - What are those big, I Is that like molasses - Oh, those are things The crew loves syrup. - [Destin] Do they? (chuckles) - If their waffles aren't - [Destin] Really. - So we make sure we have plenty of syrup. Beef bases, chicken base, We got powdered sugar. We got cake mixes, the - [Destin] Can you show me the yeast? - Yeah. We have, I wanna say about 65 That's 40 pounds of sugar. - [Destin] That's just a block of it. - There's four individual And then you have like the fry oils, tea. - You guys have been underway so that's why it's so low at the moment? - That, and we load out for how many days of food that we need for the underway. We like to have a couple extra days, just to make sure, in case but I've had this storeroom and all the way to the door, full of food. - [Destin] Really? - Yes. And it's awful, 'cause all around the backside of the store room, you have to crawl all over everything, or pull everything out to - [Destin] So it'll take - Hours. - [Destin] Thank you very much, man. - No problem, sir. - That's awesome. - Generally on submarines, almost everything we do So you know, pizza from scratch. When we do burger day, we we do the bun from scratch, we Everything is from scratch. - [Destin] You do the buns from scratch? - That's right, so we love makin' bread. Yeah, the grilled chicken you know those were from scratch too. So we try to do as much scratch as we can. I was expecting when you said pizza night, I was expecting frozen pizzas. - Why, why are they not frozen pizzas? Why are you guys making it from scratch? - Quality's a whole lot better. Quality's a whole lot better. Honestly, it's a lot easier - [Destin] What happens if (chuckles) Does it happen? - Not generally with pizza, but there's been a few times Does it happen? (chuckles) - It happens sometimes. (laughing) - There's a lot of pizzas we gotta make, and it's hard to manage - - [Destin] Well, can we - Oh yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. - [Destin] I'll follow you. - We're in the galley. So, we're given everything we need to be able to prepare meals for the crew. We have 180 people on board, or I'm sorry, 140 people on board. We can have to up about 180. We have a oven right We have a grill top you know, we use this for every breakfast, When we have chicken, we'll grill chicken on the grill top right there. We have a deep fat fryer, which is actually really nice to have, 'cause submarines are the with deep fat fryers still. So the crew loves it. It's definitely good for morale, especially for pizza night. We can do cheese sticks, all that kind of stuff - [Destin] Legit. - Yeah, yeah. - [Destin] What's your hands say? - The Blade Cafe's the name of the galley on board, the Toledo - [Destin] Nice. - Yeah, we got a food mixer right here, so anytime we need to frosting and stuff like that, And then we have two - [Destin] What do they do? - Soups, sauces, gravies, you know some of the entrees depending on what it is. - [Destin] So what's going on here? - Right here, we have pizza crust goin'. It's proofin' up right now. So, normally we go through a night, on pizza night. So we have a lot of pizzas We have a few on standby here. That way whenever some of these sheet pans start to clear out and I think one of the most challenging parts of cooking on the submarine 'Cause as you see in here, we have every countertop taken up with ingredients and pizzas. - Yeah, I'm seeing how much I got hot grease behind me. So how many people will - Just one. - One. - Just one. - [Destin] Just one, so this is crowded. - Yeah, pizza night usually - [Destin] I see all the but I don't see where you wash the pans or is that what this is? - Yes, sir. - [Destin] So, you wash all in this one room? - Yep. - [Destin] That's legit. - Yes, sir. - [Destin] Is it hard? - Yeah, (chuckles) it's not easy. Buffalo chicken pizza, We have a half pepperoni, So he's got a few made up right here. So we can throw some in here. - [Destin] Nice. - This is getting ready Chief quarters normally does like throwing a little pizza And this is gonna go out on crew's mess. - [Destin] So chief quarters, are they pretty high maintenance? - Ah, no the work, the that are normally the high maintenance. - [Destin] The officers are? - Yes, sir. (laughing) - Are we allowed to say that? - Ah, well I just did. (laughing) - Hot pan! - [Destin] This is the - I'm following you then. - Hot pan. Hot, hot, hot. - [Destin] Hot pan, you kinda - I think so, I mean out - [Crew Member] Ooh, looks good. - Request enter with pizza. - [Chief] Enter. There we go. - [Destin] Nice. [Television Presenter] He's - [Destin] So is this a big deal? Is this a good night? - Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, they ah, yeah. Definitely a good night whenever Usually we have the and we're playing some Mad, So, it's nice to be able to - [Destin] Sweet. - While gaming out. - [Destin] Rock and roll. - [Television Speaker] - [Destin] You don't - Just 'cause there's (laughing) - Yeah, you can't make everyone happy. - So you get a, - A lot of times we get and they'll still find - That's just the way it goes, huh? They're just revving you a little bit. - Yep. - What's the deal with the poppers? What's he talking about? - Pizza night, we usually do wings, cheese sticks, and that jalapeno poppers. So he's apparently waitin' for poppers. - Hey, your pizza's back there. - Waiting for it. - Yeah, you want one. (chuckles) - I'm gonna get some drinks and stuff. I'll bring the poppers. - Hey, pizza's back there. Is the Cribbage about I'll come in a minute. - So, we just got a call down from chief, let us know that we're gonna So that's where it gets because we have crusts out. We have pizzas coming in and out. We got a sheet pan full of pizzas, and now we're about to - [Destin] Meaning the boat's gonna roll? - Up and down, - Up and down, so 15 degree So if we took it right now, a lot of those pans right took it down angles, this So it's one of the most challenging parts, about cookin' on the submarine, is being able to manage And then you throw on the - Sir, sir, they just messing - No, no, that'd be pretty messed up. (laughing) so we can maximize our sustainability. So we have four weeks, or where we have set meals So every month on week one, Week two, you're gonna get the same meals. That gets populated by - Oh, my bad. So one of the interesting is there's no day and night, So this meal that happens on this 28-day cyclical calendar, is important to mark the passage of time. Even me, I was only on And when I got off, because I was so mixed up I marked the passage of Seriously, I was like, &quot;Oh, that happened two days after pizza.&quot; or, &quot;Oh, that happened It was a weirdest thing. It was like I was indexing which I mean maybe I I think having regularly satisfying meals is a critical We had ice cream on waffles one day, and that was amazing. They do that every I forget what day it was. It was ice cream and waffles If you have good food, it makes you happy. And that's critical for success, when it comes to being underwater So now what are you doing? - I'm gonna get some mozzarella sticks and the poppers ready for'em. Gotta keep the chiefs happy, man. (laughing) Chiefs aren't happy, no one else is happy. Mozzarella sticks, you overcook them, the cheese comes out of 'em, and then they're just So you gotta, you really gotta - [Destin] So I noticed - Ah, no. - [Destin] You just know? - Ah yeah, once you're you just sorta kinda know how - [Destin] Literal silverware. Ha, you steal a popper. - Request to enter to- - [Chief] Hot food. Poppers and Mozza sticks. - Oh, yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about. Sweet. - There, you need anything else? CSE has the cups. - Whenever he shows up. - Thank you, appreciate it. - Yeah, thank you. - You're welcome. - [Destin] All right, man - I'm happy. (laughing) - [Destin] There's a - Yeah, you gotta have fried (laughing) - [Destin] Rock and roll. Okay, now that the crew chiefs are fed, we're gonna go to the in the crew mess, which is amazing.
