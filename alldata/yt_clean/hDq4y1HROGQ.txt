Look ahead instead of laughing. Be careful, slow down. This is driving, not dancing. Come on, now shift gears. Unscramble, watch out. For a 1st lesson, it's very good. Give me back the steering wheel. Oh no, never. How, never? Attention. Fred. Fred. Mathias. Mathias, look. Attention. Look at. I learned to drive. Oh, but you are very beautiful. Who is it for? Oh, my cap, stop- Hey. I found the reverse gear. No. No. Leah. Lea, please. Please answer me. Lea, please. Please answer me. How are you ? Good, you? This is the first time we've kissed. It's the last time too. Oh yes, do you think so? Here we go? Why did you tell me it was the last time? Don't you like me enough? Yes, of course. Obviously, I like you. Okay, so? Listen, Leah. I'm listening, Laurent. It's not. What's that not? It's not that simple. It's complicated. Ah good ? And why? Didn't anyone tell you anything? No. Why are you speeding up? I promised your father I'd bring you back at 4 a.m. Okay then, go faster. Happy birthday, little sister. You're late. You almost turned nineteen. Are all these people for me? Eighteen years old. Lea? Mathias. Hold. Are these flowers for me? I didn't pick them, I bought them. Mathias, come help me. Mathias! Camilla! Hello, my niece. Hello, my father. I'm so happy! Well you smell good, what is it? Lavender. Loic. This pact between the Russians and the Germans may be a good thing. Two bodyguards for Europe. Two bogeymen, yes. I don't agree. The world has a fever, it's always the same. He needs a good war. A good bloodletting, is that it? I hope you don't mean what you say, Edmond. Yes, yes. Already the harvest of 38 was unhappy, we should not have a war this year. What a lovely party. Everyone loves you, you know. I missed you and these people and this country. When I think that Maria Tosca hated the heat. Who is Maria Tosca? My cousin, Camille's mother. She married the Italian consul in Senegal. The consul first fell in love with Senegal. And then from Camille's mom. Historically, that's it. Very interesting. Daladier, what do you think? Munich? Fortiche, right? Munich is a shame. And Daladier knows it better than anyone. How afraid you were of Franco. Now, with Franco, what happened? In short, nothing. Nothing? And the Republicans? Imprisoned, shot. It's nothing, that. Your wife is calling you, Edmond. I think she wants to dance with you. Memory is short. Be careful, we are changing partners. She has changed, Camille. Exchange? Yes. She's gotten better, right? Ooh there. Watch out for the storm. Suzanne. Francoise, the cake. Happy birthday. I too am very happy. Guess why. For what? I'm going to get engaged. With whom ? With Laurent, at the end of his service. Which Laurent? But Laurent! Camille. What's going on? Please, thank you. As Pierre's brother and Lea's godfather, I would like to say a few words to you before she blows out her symbolic 18 candles. Lea? Lea? Didn't you see it? Who ? Well your sister. I don't know, me. What is this ? It's for you. Happy birthday. I'll have it. I'm sure he loves me. I'll have it. And we wage war because it was imposed on us. Each of us is at our post on French soil. In this land of freedom where respect for human dignity finds one of its last refuges, you will combine all your efforts in a deep feeling of union and fraternity for the salvation of the homeland and to live France. Mr. Deladier, all the same, he will have taken us for idiots. Or are we going to stay for the harvest? The harvest is not complicated. Women, children. And then those who are older. I don't even know if I have one of particles. I was mistaken. You see, I didn't believe in war. And then. Are you going to leave? No, I'm too old. It's like fayard. But if they are too old and if they are too young, who is left to wage war? Everyone remains. To tell you the real Mr. The news is not very good. There are already a dozen buyers who have warned that they will not take anything this year because of the war. Last year, we came close to disaster. It would be necessary - What would it take? Find a solution. Maybe this Parisian, the wholesaler. Wholesaler, wholesaler. I don't want to hear any more about this guy, Victor. Can I know why? For what ? When he came, he told me that he was a big fan of Pinard. Montillac, we don't make pinard. That's why. Because I say so. It's for Montillac. In these times, do I have the means to be sensitive in these times? Is that Mr. Fayard? Last delivery. Come on. Oh, I'm tired of this. Okay, let's stop for today. What are you doing? Are you staying? Ah, I stay here. I like it. Come on, let's go home, hurry up. Hold. Go ahead, I'm in no hurry. It feels good, it's fresh. But stop, stand up. Mathias. Mathias. Mathias. Stop. But stop. When we were kids, when we played, you didn't make that much of a difference. I still don't, Mathias. Are we kids anymore? Is that the difference? Are you coming home with me? I can't. I have to help again. Lea? Are you in love with someone? Why are you telling me this? No way. he likes you, Mathias. You're jealous. She's stupid. No, but he shouldn't get upset because you don't like him. Come on, look at me. Don't you like it? For what ? He's not good enough for one. Dalmas? A fire and dalma? Would that shock you? But no. That's not what I'm saying. It's for him. He shouldn't have any illusions, that's all. These illusions are his business. Like yours, like mine. It concerns each of us. Each one, that. Character goes? Yes. We are all mobilized. For the moment, I am in the Ministry of War. But then, I don't know yet. Good morning. Laurent has an 8.4 p.m. leave. Already ? Can you mobilize me? It's for his engagement to Camille. He came to invite us. As. It's nice. Congratulations. It's a bit rushed, but very rushed. It is your uncle Adrien who will receive their commitment. Do you have time for a drink? No. This isn't aimed at you. No, that's nice, but I have to go home. Really. To confess. You understand. He has a lot to say. I'm going there. Why didn't you answer my letters? I didn't have time. They arrived in Paris yesterday. And my package? What package? The socks, the sweater and the Basque cake. I promise you, I didn't receive it. What do you find in him with Camille? Listen, Lea, please. By the way, it seems that your sister. Francoise, she wants to become a nurse in peace, my sister, what's more, Camille, it's incredible. You take my friends away from me. NOW ? I'm not taking anyone from you. My family and his have known each other for four generations. In Bordeaux. Camille, I saw her grow up. I thought she was older than you. No not at all. You're not beautiful when you're bad. But what is she better than me? She makes love better. Do you make love? Not yet. But I'm saving myself for someone good. Not a poor boy running after the consul's daughters through Arevis. Listen, Lea. I didn't promise you anything. I didn't even see you. Yes, but you don't see anything. Well, yes, you see the beautiful people, the money, the women and the consulate. You. Mix everything. First, they have no money. I laugh. And marriage in Senegal? Camille's mother bothered by flies. Maria Tosca. Anyway, I won't come. When is it? It will depend on the war. It will happen here, like the engagement. Here, in our country, it will be without me. I'm not free during the war. Come on, goodbye. Bless, Lord, this engagement ring that we bless in your name, so that the one who wears it keeps to her fiance, inviolate fidelity, remains in peace in your will and that both live always in mutual love in Christ , our Lord. Amen. And now I will ask the newly engaged couple to please kneel down. Laurent, Dargila, promise to take care. Woman and legitimate wife Camille. When you will be required by her and our holy mother the Church will put no obstacle in place? Yes, my father, I do. Promise. Camille Nerac, do you trust God and the holy Church to take Laurent as your husband here present, when you are requested by him and when our holy mother the Church will not put any obstacle to it? Yes, father, I promise. We'll take it now. What did she tell you? I didn't understand the book. Page 40. Two to sing the praises of the Lord. Alleluia. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah. Listen Victor, I will do my best. I don't promise you anything. Have a good trip, Mr. Finally, if you would only have left tomorrow, I would have had time to prepare you for memory. Victor, I don't need memory, I have memory. You've given your figures enough arguments. Dad, where are you going? In Paris. I'm coming. You're going to end up making me late. All with your goodbyes. We travel. I don't know if I'll be back for your exams. Good luck. And yes, don't worry, when you come back, I'll be a nurse. Good luck to you too. It doesn't take that long to go down the stairs though. Leah. Ah, you see there, phenomenon. What is this suitcase? Well, I'm ready. How does it work? It comes Paris with you. But there is no question of that. No, no. Pass 1 sec. Passive defense work continues actively in Paris. In public gardens, the trendy ones are caused. To ensure the protection of the population against aerial bombardments , the government decided to shelter the children of Paris. Y in two days, four convoys of schoolchildren have already left the Montparnasse stations. The Austerlitz and the Miau. In the direction of the province is going. Barnacle of the new France. It will be greater than ever before in the days when victory is achieved, the forces. Of each soldier, of each Frenchman, of each French woman are tenfold. The unhappiness has always grown. France has never been more unanimous than today. For the new line that our General Weygand has just established. All our soldiers are ready. But then, what happened? You wait much sooner. Dear Lisa, we were stuck in the box by a breakdown for 3 hours. We can push a new beat. Did you make my trip? He just told you no. It gets harder and harder all the time. Hello Albertine. I brought you Lea. Oh lea. My God, how long has it been? I don't know. Me, it's Lea. Oh lea. Leah. Hello my little gem. What did you just do here? But. Zweitausendeinundzwanzig. Oh well then, are you coming? Here we go. She is more and more mirrored. A problem? I like this chamberlain very much. And then this self control, then always elegant. No matter how much we say, it counts and your little workers? Ah that, Hitler. No, no, the little ones in the workshop. Oh yes. Oh, you know, they're together all day. Yousand. So she laughs and then the. In the evening, they are all alone. So she cries. This was your mother's room. She brought you here a long time ago. Well, you can't remember, you were too little. Hey, do you see this mirror? You were the one who broke it. Wasn't there a portrait of her? Yes. But we have it. Away. We thought it would be better. I don't know why. So you can imagine it here at. Same age as you. Where she's going, where she's going? Mlle. Mlle. I have an appointment with Lieutenant Laurent d'Argila. That would surprise me, because people of the same sex are not allowed inside. Given the circumstances. You can prevent it. Without ordering you. The problem is. That I am not the secretariat. Please. You are the beautiful hen who me. Request ? No, but what is it? Are you in Paris? I'm chasing you. Are you taking me to lunch? Another day, if you want. You have to warn me. I can't free myself like that. I know that today, for me, I can't. I won't stay here, you'll get harassed. Wait for me under the arcades. Right away. Aren't you looking for the girl with the hat? Yes. She's already home. No, here. Yes, that's a good idea. It's nice here. Yes, very cool. Take yourself. The Aperitif? No. Yes, a glass of Bordeaux. A white one. So give me some news from home. It's the same as yours. The men go to war, then the women. They wash between. They were engaged. It's safe from bombs, I assume. No, she has Paris at home. Would be very happy to see you. She loves you very much, you know. Listen, Lea. How long will the war last? I want to talk about the war you are waging against me. It's what ? We got married. Married? Yes, it's war. She was afraid for me, I. Feared for us, so we got married. Already married? After six weeks of engagement. How many children do you have? Please, Lea. There's no please. Who do you take me for? Please. There's no Lea. There's no more Lea, you don't understand. Please. SO ? While I, I. I love you. Hello, lieutenant. Francois, were you there? Lea Delmas, Francois Tavernier. But yes. We've already been seen at your engagement. Do you remember? No, I don't remember. It doesn't matter. Must. Don't put yourself in such a state. You know, I've seen pearls before. In women's ears. But like the ones that shine in your eyes. This is the 1st time. This is the first time I've heard such nonsense. Francois is a great friend. Mine. That doesn't surprise me. Thanks for the little glass of white. Please. Leah. Listen, Lea. She is very, very, very gracious, the mistress. Stop. So maybe I have. A chance to. Catch her before the border. You chose Mr. Chose who? Mlle? Go away. Come on, come on. I'll take you back. My car is just around the corner. I have mine. It is square. Ah good ? What car do you have? I don't know the brand of my car. Anyone. I have a message from Laurent. Go ahead, I'll listen to you. Well there you go. As you have understood, Laurent is no longer available, since he is already married. So he told me. That I had my chance. I am free. Lie. Laurent couldn't. Of course. Obviously I'm lying. Bastard. Leah. Stop following me. Lea, you look so beautiful when angry. It gives you even more light. But more seriously, I'm a friend of. Camille. I have a very fraternal affection for him. Laurent, it's me who brings them to the ministry. I watch over them. If you want. So leave them alone. Take my advice. Now I leave you. Leah. Lea, call me. I like women. You like men. We should meet eventually. So, have a good ride? Very good. Do you like Paris? Enormously. Come on, hop on. What's going on? Y Finally. What is it? Lea, will you answer me? I want to return to my country. With my house, my friends. I was wrong. I want to go home. Alright. You came with me, you will leave with me. Ah, Camille is here. You're going to be. Glad to have it. Good morning. There's a lot going on in. My little life. I called Montillac. They told me you were there. How lucky for me, and she has a little secret to tell you. YDavid. She is expecting a baby. A baby? But what is happening? But what's happening to you, my darling? Help me get there. But what's happening to you? No, it's nothing. It's because I didn't have lunch. Lunch. But why didn't you have lunch? I'll get you some water. That's it. I'm going to warm up the veal for you. Don't worry, I'm here. Listen, Lea, I didn't promise you anything. We got married and there, in me, a guy who disappoints me personally is Stalin. I was talking about it the other day with the father of the two kids who live downstairs. Mr. Coulomb. Communist, but at the same time very ole ole. You would have seen him dancing at the Catherinettes ball the other day. What was I saying? Stalin. Ah yes, Stalin. I don't understand how he can get along with this puppet. It leaves me speechless. What. Stalin with Hitler. Oh yes, yes. Talk to me. Is everything ready? My Tyrolean bag is in my room. You're not going to go to war, Albertine? No. But yes. We are forced to retreat. It's written in Paris Soir. Avoid suitcases. Take a camping bag with some laundry. I added what I needed. And then sew inside his garment. The family record book. The Savings Bank booklet. And then think about taking out a rent receipt. THANKS. And you don't eat. Not, my sweet? But you're not going to pass us off again? By the way, we will leave again on Sunday. Sunday ? But you told me Saturday. Yes, but Camille Laurent is giving a reception on Saturday evening. I don't want to go, I'm too tired. But you will go. Y why me? Out of friendship. Camille? Yes. Elea. Leah. I don't know. I hope she understood the address. Good evening. Mlle love, right? Come, come, come. Don't stand still. Go! Go! Go. We have to fight. All right ? Go! Go! Go. From. From. Style, rhythm. So, do you like Parisian life? And you ? Didn't you go to the front? Are you reformed? Leah. Leah, Leah. Do you know what we should do? We should make up. But then right away. Impossible. Leah. You don't know anything about life. I will teach you. Lea is the vintage of peace. Quit it, these are the last drops. Just because we're going to die doesn't mean we're going to stop living. Come on. And my birthday cake from Munich? There are a few crumbs left. And we can drink at work if we're not going to get it done. Oh, you're kidding. We're in a fancy place here. So there, congratulations. Very successful this. Alert. Valea. Did I introduce you to Francois? Tavernier, my friend? He. Presents himself alone and he presents himself badly. I see that you have already met him, Lea. My advice? Don't trust them. Appearances. Camille, come see, please. Delighted. Sarah Molstein. Leah, why. Are you dating such an odious man, Mlle? Oh no, Mme, I am married. Francois is trying to help me get my father and my husband out of Germany. Sarah is the daughter of Israel Lazarus, the great conductor. But why do they want to leave Germany? Because they are Jewish. So what? Well Lea, you see, in this. At the moment, in Germany, the Jews are humiliated, tortured and killed. Forgive me, I didn't know that. Come, let's dance, Sarah. Waiting for the music to be returned to you. I love you. I know. I love you. Every day I fall asleep in your arms and wake up with you. I'm leaving tomorrow. Are you leaving? Where? There, at the front. I have something to ask you. For. Me ? For you. Is it yes? The doctor said that Camille should stay in bed. He fears for our child. His parents are. Gone. So I would like to. Stay in Paris for. Help him. Me ? Are you asking me this? I will be far away. I'm afraid. Finally, you understand. No, I don't understand. What's so extraordinary? What is it? Are you asking me? Me who loves you and everything. You. Love me. ? Love. Here too, I accept. I will stay with her. I will stay with your wife. Make no mistake. It's because I love you. And when you think of her, you'll have to think of. Me. What are you doing here? Here, its for you. I didn't pick them, I bought them. I love you. I love you. I love you. Listen, yes. If I die, it doesn't matter. Forget I told you, okay? I love you from the beginning of my life. I love you very much. Goodbye my darling. Take care of yourself. Don't worry. I'm a big girl. Not for me. You always remain my little girl. I'll come back to my till hack as soon as Laurent's baby. Finally, the. Camille's baby. When you are born. That's what you're doing. Zweitausendeinundzwanzig. We knew they would come back. They came. France has been invaded 100 times, but never defeated. Our brave northern populations are scattered. It is through incredible panic that they have. Then. No, no, it's not bad, but that's more interesting. Celine's corpse school. Happiness of style, misery of thought. It's a curiosity. Here. Don't be afraid, I am absolutely homosexual. Is it not true, Mlle Gondin, that I am absolutely homosexual? Please Mr. Malle, you are not here to advertise. You owe foreign customers. Oh, the foreign clientele for a Swiss. I know him, he's from Bern. Nausea by Jean Paul Sartre. It's for a friend who is pregnant and often sick. So do you understand? Corpse school or Nausea? Oh, how cute she is. Ah, actually, let me introduce myself, it's Raphael male. Male. Like the male male with an h in the middle. Here, I'll mark it for you. Look. You are completely ok. What are you doing? No, but I'll take it Mlle gurnard, I'll take it. Here. That would be nice. It's for that person who is so. So cute. Oh hey. To beaver. This is Simone de Beauvoir. There is also a sentence from Celine just below, in emphasis. Shall I read it to you? He is a boy of no collective importance. He's just an individual. It seems like he's talking about me. Besides, he's talking about me here too, this bastard. What do we mean about you? Ah yes, he speaks well of [sos/eos] because I am. I am Jewish. She should read this. Put it all on me, Mlle, see you soon. Bye. Oh, I know. I know where we met. In Florence, at the end of the 15th century, on the wall of a small chapel. Exact. I remember it. Come on, a little smile, Mlle. Good. Alright. So I'm going to kill myself. And then I will cut my corpse into small pieces because of you. Oh well, there you go. Come on, see you soon. Leah. I feel a lot better, you know. It's the doctor who forces me to stay in bed. I know the sacrifice that must be for you. What sacrifice? He stays far from Montillac. Laurent told me how generously he was in asking you to stay with me. Did he tell you I proposed? Yes. I received a letter. Already ? He took me on the train. He is so tender. If you only knew how he talks to me about us, about our child. I'll read it to you. Stay in bed. You're tired. Hold. I'll bring you PS1. Tense at night. What a lovely title. What is this? I don't know anything. I made a new friend. It's his card. I admire you, you know. Why do you say that ? You have no reason to admire him. Listen to me, Alea. I can keep myself company well. Your life is not here. And I don't want to be a burden. But shut up. Tomorrow. But no, I won't shut up. Your affection touches me a lot. Mme. Mme, the Dr is here. Good. I'll leave you. I'll come back later. Leah. THANKS. Lawrence. My Laurent. 1st Christmas without you, but last Christmas without you. I wish it. Well, no. I want it. Camille and I spent it with my aunts, Lisa, Albertine. They are so funny. Like next to time, next to things, in fact. They are distraught, but they disguise themselves so that it doesn't show. As if. They had difficulty keeping a straight face during the war. And our Christmas presents were laughter. My Laurent, I know that your heart is in parentheses. You are so honest. But I know your secret is that you love me. Do you love me? The days pass. Where are you, my love? Time flows. Be calm. I take care of Camille and friends take care of me. Stylish friends whose lining is torn. Laurent, I don't know how to finish my letter. I'm waiting for you. I'm waiting for you, my Laurent. I hope this war never happens, Lea. France has not yet thought about its deep wounds that others already have. See, they're not allowed to say exactly where he is. But from his last letter, I imagined it. This way. There, I will move forward. The Germans. I'm behind them. We leave this red flag, Camille. And it's rabid Laurentian. The enemy by day, by night, it's like a bloodstain in the forest. Entire cities were cruelly bombed. Hundreds of residents were killed, thousands more injured. It makes me so happy. Why did you call me? I don't know. Out of curiosity, perhaps. And then because I know what it's like to be alone in Paris. Do you think I'm alone? You know, the other night, in this cellar, during the alarm, I was watching you. You navigated between noises, between men. Like a little solitary shadow between men. You seem to know them well. And yes. How to avoid them? You can avoid some of them. Are you going to talk to me again about Francois Tavernier? This one, I find odious. He. Ballast. Would you like to know my relationship with him? No. A little jealous, though? You like him, anyway. I know he likes you a lot. To him, no. Me, with Francois, it's something else again. I will never love. But I will always love him. And where are we going now? See an American musician who knows people in Berlin who could perhaps do something for my father and for my husband, David. SO ? Bad news. Bastard Nazis don't want to let them out of Germany. My father is too old to go through all this. Do you realize, Lea? Only because he's Jewish. He who was received throughout the world as a genius, he is now treated like a dog. He can no longer work and he is deprived of his only reason for living , music. So don't make that stupid face, you're for nothing. But tell me a little about yourself. What do you love in life? This is a very big question. I don't know. I like a lot of things. When I say love, I mean why. Who would you be willing to die for? For my. Tillac. It's the name of my father's estate. We make wine and that's it. I could die for my. Earth. Right on time. You have to have these attachments that are stronger than anything. You are a wonderful girl, Lea. M. Good evening, Mme. Francois Taberne. You are one of Lea's famous aunts in the Baptists. Where do you talk about it? Famous? Look, I don't know. But finally. Come in, please come in. THANKS. Is she ready? Ready? Yes. We are going to Saint Eustache for the concert for the benefit of the Red Cross. Yousand after the President of the Republic. The President of the Republic? Listen, I don't know anything. My sister went to change her gas mask. I'll get the small one and the last pieces next to it. Sit for 1 second. But finally, you are not going to keep the President of the Republic waiting. Hurry up with your life. Your friend is next door. He's very classy. Well done, aunt. What is this story? He's not my secretive friend. It arrives by sense. Ah, Leah. What, are you only there? But have you seen the work? What does that mean? No, no. You're kidding me. Lea, I have spoken to you at least three times about this concert. Just yesterday, at the Ponts Chartrains, I told you. But who? But. Anyway, Lea, let's see. Leah. Do you recognize me? Your face tells me something. But I. It is. Happy. Anyway, I have nothing to wear. But how? There's everything you need downstairs. I you. Bring her back in 5 minutes. All dressed up. ? Are you talking? Claude, stop acting like a puppet. Lea is expected by the President of the Republic. The President of the Republic? Yes, it's possible. But yes, it's possible. Come on, come on. It's possible. Who is this Mr. Come on, take off your hat. Combination. Oh no. I'm not going to fuck around. He is handsome, but he is handsome. There is one thing above all that we immediately see, and that is his education. Stop saying who. And then that's it, I got pissed because of you. But hurry up, I don't have zweitausendein all the time. But here, it's going to be very pretty, you'll see. What is this sleeve you are giving me? It's not the first fitting. Y you know what I like in you, Lea? No. All. Nothing. In both cases, it's too much. And you ? A cigarette? Yes. Will it be the first of the evening? No, my whole life. What a pleasure to keep you. What a pleasure. If you wait until I cough. And a rod, I won't cough. And you, what do you do for a living, in the absence of war? I'm trying to make you like me. But that's not a job. No, but it's work. Do you dance? Sit down. Save me that, Mr. Here. The Germans are in Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg. In three kicks, they will be with us. Yes. Especially since we knew it but no one listened to anyone. And Laurent? Lawrence? Lawrence? I don't know. Yes, that's it. THANKS. I'm expected at the ministry. You are so important. Lea, I. Bye. The war is on old Europe. The war of the. The war of the machines. The war of matter in the service of an evil force that spares no one. So are you running away too? But we are not running away, Mme Chambard. We retreat to be able to reattack better later. What do you want? They have already crossed the Oise and the Marne. Don't you want us to wait for them with a cup of tea? Where are you going? We are going above Grenoble. We have another sister there. They are married to a small farm in the Vercors. In the Vercors, you will be peaceful. What is she doing? But what do you do with your skis? You're not going to evacuate Paris on skis. Please. Hello, Mme Chopard. Hello, Mlle. And what time is it your. Logically, at 12 p.m. We have to hurry. Bye. Bye. Goodbye, my darling. Thank you very much for everything. So, how long did we stay in Paris? Will depend on Camille. When will this toddler be born? I don't remember anymore. Maybe in a few days. He chooses his moment poorly. Here, my little darling. It was in your mom's drawer. I almost forgot. It's pretty. It's tapestry. She was the one who did it. Oh no, but I. I can't. It's too much. I can't take this. Do you want to be quiet? You need. To take the train? Listen, I beg you. We already blame each other. What ? It feels like you're handing yourself over to the enemy. Oh there, you're going a little far. In any case, it will help me a lot. THANKS. Come on, goodbye, my sweet. You have to understand. We're scared. Goodbye, both of you. I love you. Yousand. Ah, Mlle. Mme felt unwell this morning when she heard the news on the radio. The Dr is here. That's not true. She's a nurse I know. Impeccable. Goodbye, Mlle. My darling wife. I thought about you so much. Terrifying stay course. It's incredible. Everything is so brutal. We were soldiers and we became fugitives. Everywhere, crowded cars, motorcycles, bicycles, belongings and people in disarray. Women who cry and men who cry too. Your letters arrived all at once. When I think that this little child will be born into this mess of life. And what happiness. Yet. I have a friend who calculated based on our birth times that it would be a girl. He is never wrong. Your last letter told me that Lea is now next to you. Tell him I thank him. What a precious friend. Camille. My Camille. I only think about. You. My darling wife. I only think of you. Good morning. Good morning. Sit down. Are you still in Paris? You haven't taken off like everyone else? Yes. In a few days, I was returning home to Bordeaux. Let me introduce you to my nephew. Delighted. He speaks neither French nor English. Obviously, I don't speak Danish. We understand by gestures. He is a dancer. He doesn't look like much, but. Zweitausendeinundzwanzig. You would see him in slippers. I have a little trouble imagining him in a slipper, but I'll take your word for it. And you, Raphael, what will become of you? Well, I don't know. I am invited to flee. In very elegant places. Cannes, Biarritz. That's what's exhausting about these hostilities, the worldly affairs. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, there will perhaps be only one car in Paris. But stop with your straw, you. People are looking at us. But in truth, I. I'm bluffing. And I'm not sure I can bluff the Krauts. Terrarfi to do. He is. Yes, that's it, that's it. He's nice. You didn't understand anything. You know, I loved you right away. The definition. However, resistance was organized. I would like my child to be born elsewhere. On an island, with flowers and birds. Do you know how I find you there? No. Tell me. Particularly cucu. And you, do you want to know how I see you? There ? Yes. Go ahead. That interests me. That's it, she's coming. Do you hear? Calm down. Calm down. It'll be OK. Mom will find a solution. How are you. Please. Please. For safety reasons, we will keep the doors closed until 5 a.m. after 12 p.m. Let me speak. Don't panic. Everyone will leave. 30. Eight additional trains are planned. You will all leave. Some of you will leave. After the others, but you will leave. A car. A car from the sky. Let's not exaggerate anything. I have only just returned from Dunkirk. As for the car, it's true. I found one for you. The great fear reaches Paris. The Parisians were not worried about a war which seemed very distant to them. But the front moved closer and Paris was bombarded. The departure of members of the government four days ago, launched Paris and still there. You might be able to help me, Josette, without ordering yourself. No, I can't. For what ? I apologize. I'm afraid. I can't. How are you. We have to go again, Lea. Yes yes. I'm hurrying. Quickly. I judge you. We're going to get there. How are you. We're going to get there. Both of them. Please, someone, a doctor. There is a woman who is going to give birth. She is sick. Everyone left. Even the Drs. It's just me. She is beautiful, Remy. We're going to stop there now. Apparently there is no one left. Hello, Mlle? Yes. I would like to go up to. In Gironde, please. No, no. I don't know where from. I'm calling. Yes, yes, I'm waiting. Hello ? Hello, Mlle? Do you hear me? Hello ? Hello. Who in extreme destitution travel our roads. I express my compassion and concern to them. It is with a heavy heart that I tell you today, we must stop the fight. I have addressed this life to the adversary. You stop the fight. And. This is information that will have escaped your services. Captain. Order to all units. Any withdrawal of civil and military authorities is prohibited, even in the event of the enemy's arrival. What does this mean? This means that we. Has a duty to surrender, Francois. To disobey. But right away. Do you think that I. Will I have time to visit Nosso before returning home? It's my dream. Frankly, Major, I don't think it was just military installations that were responsible. From the numerical inferiority of French weapons and. From the lack of armor and planes. Francis. What a surprise. Are you on vacation in the region? And you ? Is this the outfit you're looking for the government in? But you don't think you're saying that well. He's naked. Zealous, uniform, everyone follows the same path. And there, I took advantage of your bathroom to clean up. You really need it. And you too, for that matter. Who told you this? Marshal Petain. You should have told him the war starts today. On the contrary. By making peace with Germany, he. Declared war on France. I'm afraid, Francois. I'm afraid. Make love to me. I'm not going to die before then. To have done. Love. And Laurent, what will your prince charming think? It's not the same. I love him. Ah good ? You scared me like that. I don't mind. And then I love you. That's enough for now. I don't know what you did to that car, but nothing. Users are everything. User. It's like saying a piece of jewelry is used. Zweitausendein. Francis. Do you think Laurent is a prisoner? I hope so. I hope so. If he's a prisoner, that's fine. To say that he is alive. Exactly. You found it. Where are we? You make me laugh. There are billions of. Roads. It's written in lowercase. Good. Well, we are going to systematically raise all the bridges of the law. So let's swim, girls. No, not yet, Captain. No. No cord at all, huh? But we have two kilos of explosives and a cannon. 20 five. We're not going to blow up an idiot with that. Let's stay serious. That's never been seen before. Hello ? He hung up on me . That's it, it's ready. Fire. Name of God. What is this? Stop it. Come on. Take the wheel. Don't start the car. Come on, come help me. Push them. Quickly. Yousand I lose the bones. How ? I'm losing bones. Fission. Leah. Let's go. Halt. Halt. Halt. Jeden tag. Rein ein Freund stirb an ein. Help me, please. Go die. You are welcome. So, except. You don't understand. Help me? Stossen Stossen. Stossen. Stossen Sie. Stossen. Stossen. Gut gut. Stossen Sie. Stossen. Stossen. Stossen. Atmen Sie. Atmen. Atmen. Atmen. Stossen. Stossen. Stossen. Stossen. Stossen. Atmen. Atmen. Gut. Gut. Achtung. Achtung. Gut. Gut. Sehr hatten, sie jetzt. Atmen. Gut gut. Sehr sehr gut. Stossen Sie. Stossen. Stossen. Stossen. Sehr gut. Stossen Sie gut Stossen. Stossen Stossen. Ein Knabe. Achtung. It's a boy. What is his name? I don't know. Lawrence. Yes. Lawrence. That's it. Take it in your head. THANKS. Attention. Fragile. Yes I know. Fragile. My tears had been weapons and all my screams, guns. I would have known how to fight another war. You never know. But if I had been just a little more than the beginning of a woman, I would have. Suffered like my father. My country, over there. All those people over there. The land of men is taken and breaks like a worm. You had to learn. Old Camille. That's it, we can leave. Camille. Mlle Lea. Yes, yes, it's Mlle Lea. She is with Mlle Camille. Come and prepare my arm. I'm going to give him an injection. The bleeding has stopped. She is saved. It'll be OK. As long as it doesn't get infected, anyway. A little marvel. He's not very old, the little one. He's not good, old man. How much does that cost him a day? I'm not at risk of getting bitten? There is no time. I'm tired. How is the house? Our country? Our country is defeated, like the rest, our country. Did you have any news? How ? Normal. But his parents? They left to join those of Camilla. Dakar. The white rocks were requisitioned by the Germans. A child of love, then? The love child is when you are not married. Married or not married, it's love that counts. It was tea. Do you understand now, Pierre, why you have to come with us? Do you understand? An armistice is just the Arabistice. The treaty in fact. Not yet signed. If you want to be fooled, believe Hitler is the touch. And you, how are you? Are you okay up there? Are you leaving, at the castle? At the castle. It's okay, we're getting by, like everyone else. Yes, but like everyone else, it's not the same world anymore. No. You understand me, right? Among the French, there are those who won the war and those who lost it. And the French who won the war. You make me laugh. It gives me pleasure to make you laugh. No, because I might as well tell you, Mlle de Montillac, I respect the Germans. Germany is a big country, if you accept the rules of the game. It's quite a blessing for us, the little ones. For little ones like me, that's it. Do you understand now? I know the exact meaning of the word small. How much do I owe you for this stunt? Nothing. You'll get the boost. You and yours. And you will cry, I swear. Help this wall to the little ones. And that it will sink to the ground soon. But no, it's okay, loic. You're better with scissors. And the boys with the scissors and the girls with the cart. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Come on, hop on. Oh, everyone. We stop at the end of the row, there. There's no point, it's too late. Come on, Victor. We can do it. The sky is starting to get tired. Good. We just have to continue until the 1st star and we're going to dough them. The 1re star, Laurent, you do not agree. ? Our country has become a distant land. Foreign, and not only because we find German soldiers there. Defeat is like a disease, an epidemic that spreads and insinuates itself everywhere. In hearts, in mouths, in eyes and ears. Due to lack of arms, we lost. This year a big part of the harvest. The war. What a misfortune. What sadness. What would life be like without her? You told me that she rushed your marriage to Camille. It's selfish to say it, but the war stole my time to take my Laurent from you. God knows if you will ever read this letter. If someone unknown finds it, read it. Tears it up, who knows it was a love letter. Love, Lea. And there you have it. It's always the same menu. Soup, soup, soup. It's not the meat that's at risk. It's very good, it's already a lot. It's the same menu for everyone. Oh, look, Lea, now is not the time to electrocute yourself. But you are also beautiful to me. Tell me, Camille, Dr. Blanchard has. Said. That you were healed now. So maybe we should shake it up a little. Marc, I can't do it. And if only I had news from Laurent. He doesn't even know his son was born. To my. Notice, he must suspect it. You're not 11 months pregnant. I know where he is right now, what he's going through and what he's going through. So, are our little sufferings okay, Lea? Why are you so hard on Camille? She annoys me. She won't stop fooling around. Oh, you are all so good to me. But if Laurent, he was there. Ouch. In case that calls him escaped by the moment, Laurent. Is Camelia's husband. Camille's husband, that's clear. You're calling me to order, right? That's it. And those most affected by the cruelties of the blockade are the children who have the vitamins essential to their regular growth. It's a real miracle, you. Milk. After all that, it hurts, it hurts me. It would be better for you if you stopped breastfeeding him. I'll try to get you some milk at the hospital. Well, I'm going there, eh. Where are you going? At the post office, look for the letters. The door, the mail. Does it still work? Yes, but I'm going anyway. It works, it works. It works, huh? Come on, Bartali, go ahead. Mlle Lea, aren't you coming to see something with us? No, I was looking for the mail. The courier is behind you. Leah. I'm late. Physically, I am. A little tight. How's your wife? Yes, that. Go. She is dead. Here, I have something for you. It is a letter for the young Mme d'Argila. She is at home with you. See you tomorrow. Yes. There are already many of you here. You are comfortable in this house. Our home is your home. A room for each of you and a dormitory for 10 of your men. With convenience, as you say, MM. It's difficult. The house is big. But there are many of us. Yes, but there are many of us too. Can we? I'm looking for the word verhounden. Speak French, negotiate. No, Mr. Schwer diese muster geh nicht so. Schnell. My dear love, I don't know where this letter will find you. I am. I am in Westfallenhof, in Pomerania, in an off lag. We were allowed to write a letter. Just one and not too heavy. I might as well tell you that I'm passing on my words. My strength is nobody's business. I'm thinking of you. To you and our little child. I wish they never saw what I saw. We will have to know that we. We are beaten and we have not fled. In the evening while looking for sleep, I try. To hear the little songs you have to sing to him. Tell Lea that I think of her too. I finish by kissing you. Kissing your hands, your mouth. Leah. Leah. A Mr. Francois Tavernier. Francis? But where is he? Where are you ? We have just received a letter from Laurent. Is he alive? Yes. All right. Alright. Finally, you raged. Well, don't you? Sit down, Lea. What is this place? It's a black market restaurant. You see it clearly. Above, they have bedrooms. You avoid. And what do you do there? I asked you a question. You know, Lea, in these times. Run, you have to know what you want. And you're hungry, I'm sure. I recommend the foie gras. They have something exceptional. Answer me. What are you doing there? Shh. I spy. Who are you spying on? Everyone, by chance. THANKS. But tell me about the end of your car ride. I stayed at the Port Boulet bridge. And after? You had good weather. But there, more reasonably. Not just water, shells, armored vehicles. And even a little baby. To finish. We called him Laurent. He is very handsome. Don't tell me he looks like you. So you still love him? You won't get over it. Never. Never. If only you knew what that meant. And how did you get out of it? Zweitausendeinousand. But through my connections, my darling. Don't call me honey. But what do you want me to call you, since I love you? Imagine that I am not for sale, even for foie gras and. The girl of 20 nine. It's up to me to decide when and with whom I will make love. But. Of course it is. You who decide to come join me in my room. My darling. Mlle Lea. Good evening. Yousand. Lieutenant Kramer and Lieutenant Henke. Who is staying in Montillac? A friend. Bernard. Bernard. Guten Abend. Oh, if you speak German and you will hear them. Kramer. It's a fairly common name in Germany. Aus Stuttgart. Aus Stuttgart. Sie gehen die Stadt. The Neckar. Goethe's favorite river. Very. Interesting. Excuse me. Good evening. Are you going to the castle? Yes, at the castle. To fellow. I'll take you back. It is. THANKS. Do you have a lantern? The moon. It's open. Enter. Enter. You're just a tim. That one esp. No. Do you find it? Do you want me to tell you? You flatter me, my sweet. And this place. And the Germans. Yes ? It disgusts me. You say that because you had a good dinner. And just now, you devoured the Baron d'Agneau with your teeth. Because I was hungry. No. Because it's your nature. Because you are a wolf, not a victim. That's why I love you. Cigarettes? No. Don't be a bad player. I don't play. And Laurent, dare to tell me that it wasn't a game. But you don't understand. Laurent, I love him. Little girl, you only chase because he has it. Married someone else. I loved him to y. What is all this for? You swore he would love you. But if you had it, and you will, you wouldn't want it anymore. Come on. Now I have things to do. Enter your home. Snap your fingers and I'll come. And I'm leaving. That's it. But I haven't said everything. I'm listening to you. I. Don't like you, Francois. I don't like you. That's it. Escaping is nothing. Well, it's nothing. It is. Above all, nothing to eat, nothing to sleep. Fear, cold. Days, nights. We hide, we get lost. It's good. What do you eat? What ? That ? No. But it's good to eat. It's Christmas dinner. Is it Christmas? Yes, it's Christmas. It is. Is what they say true? That there are some who want to continue fighting? Yes. Some. Never seen your son once in a photo. Afterwards, we were changed from that one. I haven't received anything more from Camille. I don't know where she is. In Paris, in Africa, I don't know. But Laurent, she is still in Montillac. In Montillac. And if you shark with love all your life. He's been fine ever since. Yeah. There is a young Saint Macquerre who was taken prisoner. Come on, Victor. Do you know what he's asking? Soap. It's true that there are people. Who will organize themselves to cross the demarcation line. Demarcation? Yes, I believe there are smugglers. Finally, I heard. It's not smart what they're doing. It's dangerous for everyone. And the Germans don't have that. Is it mom? You look like him there. Who is that there? It's me, V. Five years old. The little boys next to you look like they're married, right? It's Matthias. Oh yeah. Joseph. Suzanne. Wake up. They found your savings. Good evening. Excuse us. Happy Christmas anyway. Thank you, M. It will be for another year. Run away from him. Baby. Take it, Camille. THANKS. It's not a bomb. Camille. But that's not true. But where are you from? From Germany. How do you come from? I escaped. He's our son. He's handsome. His name is like you. Camille. Das kann man wohl sagen Die hat was ganz besonderes. Ich bin so gut. Klavier aber tut was man kann. Already finished? Noch ein bisschen Kaffee. Sofort, herr Hauptmann. I can ? Yes. From the hammer, from the liver, from the word not found. I called, no one. I went to their house. Bell door. I don't know what to do. Strong. I am strong. Two are missing there. Ah good ? I note, Commissioner. And Bergounian too. Bergounian, I note. We're going to go see this one. Stop. Supply control. I didn't scare you when. Even ? Hello, Mme. Mlle. Can I take a look? It's part of my new responsibilities. It's not the one that amuses me the most. Besides, which one amuses you the most? Mr. Fio. And are flowers allowed? Have you heard from your husband, Mme? Still in 1st year. He had to be released. And then no, but because we would have seen it in Bordeaux, it seems, this winter. I don't know who told me that. I didn't notice it, unfortunately. If you ever come across him, tell him to let me know. We know each other even if we don't know each other anymore. Celtics. But what are the Celtics smoking at the castle? He's my father. He smokes cigars more. Gosh, he's known for that though. He smokes cigars for. To be known. And since everyone at home already knows him, he smokes. Celtics. Well, enjoy it. I'm not talking to you about myself or my salary. I'm talking to you about a seriously ill person. This is your domain. Either we call an ambulance, or. Well he's dead. Your ambulance is a tanker to deliver Montillac wine to the Germans. Well no, Victor he toasts. Victory with a wine other than mine. Well, finally, they can requisition it whenever they want. There they offer to pay him extra. So if we accept, we are sure of being able to sell almost all the stock and restore part of the vintage for next year. I said no. I'm warning you, I don't know what you're doing with your brother, but everyone sees that you're no longer there to save Montillac. So me. I warn you that I would have warned you. I'm going there. Don't expect me to come to dinner this evening. I'm on call. Oh well, is it every evening now? A nurse at the hospital in Langon? Only one and that's my sister. It's not me who decides the schedules. I will have rest afterwards. So much the better. Because me here. I am on call day and night. That. Interested if I tell you that we will have to sell the upper vines? But of course I'm interested. Do you think I get some fresh air there? Do I bring flour, meat, clothes back from the hospital? Yousand it doesn't do everyone any favors. Okay, I'm going, I'm going to be late. Yes, don't worry, you won't be late. Because German cars go fast. And above all it is a priority. It's time for the talking room. I decided to give myself a break. And my recreation is you. I wonder why I escaped. I had more room in my bar. Yes, but in your boat at West Machine Thing, there was no me. It's true. Neither Camille, nor my son. Do you know he came up yesterday? It's good to see him. My own son. Do you realize? No, not very good. What are you going to do? Would like to act. Do you know who de Gaulle is? No. A fighter, a general. He wanted to continue the war from North Africa. The government refused and preferred an armistice. He's in London now. He calls for resistance. I listen to his messages on English radio. I'm going crazy here. I remember Francois who said that we had lost in advance only de Gaulle. Francis? Francois Tavernier? Yes. It seems that. You two have become very close. What told you that? Laurent, you're not going to get rid of me by telling me about romances with your wife's friends. I will never give up on you. Never. You see, I even have patience. It's you I love. You love me too. I will never admit it. By saying I will never confess, you just confess. We had a meeting more than a half hour ago in Bordeaux with a restaurateur who wanted to buy us some wine. And really, this is exaggerating it. It's going to die. It's me who's telling you that, by the way. Well, don't say things like that. He doesn't want to sell to the Germans. Okay, let's admit. But if he doesn't want to sell to the French either. So, what do we do? Are we putting the key under the vine? Yes. Please. I need to talk to you. I print you, my darling. Between. What's happening to you? And you, what's happening to you? You had an appointment today in Bordeaux with Fayard. You weren't. Why are you leaving the house alone? Camille, what about little Laurent? Francoise, she's going to the hospital. And you disappear all day. But what is happening? I was long when I went to see Adrien. I don't believe you. You're hiding something from me. I remind you that I am your father and that I do not have to undergo interrogation from you. Y Yes, Dad, but the upper lands have been sold. We write off debts. We no longer have money to pay. Person. I. I know you like my theater. I'm grateful for everything you do. Now leave me. I want to know if you are one of those people who are organizing resistance. Dad, please say it. I shared the danger with you. GOOD. That's going to be four. Months since we formed the Jeannot group. I think it's time for a first assessment. Until now, we have done little things, injections. We have. Summer. Bees on the grapes. But Laurent, who is the only one. Soldier. Among Us, think we can't leave it at that. Since Pierre led me to you, as Adrien would say, going down with you into this cellar, I have the impression of going back up. V. Light. I never talk like that. It's true. I believe we need to go further. We cannot remain isolated like this. It is absolutely necessary to get in touch with other groups. And with London too. With London, when do you want us to do it? It's not next door. In London too, they need to know us. It seems that there are agents circulating. I heard about a certain Colonel Mayenne. Cutting telephone wires, tearing up posters, stealing weapons. It's great. But actions. Scattered like that, if we continue like amateurs, it's not enough. We must put ourselves at the service of an overall plan, like an army. So there you go. For a while, we will stop our meetings. Adrien moved around quite freely, protected by his outfit. Is it used as a table or to protect? It will list all the networks that have already been created in our region and we will stay in touch through it. You will have to go to confession twice a week. We will have to find sins. Sorry, father? From there, from one network to another, it will be a matter of passing messages, orders and coded information. We need letters. Laurent is wanted, cannot take care of it. And I'm too well known in the region. I can do it. Me too. Heard. We have two letters. Three. What are you saying? Three letters. Three letters, one of which was voted for. GOOD. Forgive me for putting it back on you. Order again and again, don't talk to anyone, even with family, everyone is fragile. Y here in London, the 1st Minister, Mr. Winston Churchill, speaks in French. French, it's me. Look at the pivot. Here in this city of London, Hitler claims to be reduced to dust. Oh, excuse me. I was looking for a glass of water. There is so much work at the estate at the moment that I haven't had time to eat dinner yet. Do you see? But do, do. You are at home here. Difficult to say, but I admire you, Mr. Delmas. Good evening. Good evening. Do you need anything else? Excuse me. No. I thought I heard a noise, like a radio. A radio? No, no, it's squeaking rats. There aren't any everywhere up there. He looks for food like everyone else and finds nothing. Like everyone else. Good evening. Good evening. MM Come quickly. Quickly. Mr. Delmas. MM. Hello Mr. Delmas. We come for a search. A search? Hello Fio. What are you looking for? You could have made a phone call. We're looking for someone. If we. Had called, that. It would have been telephoned. As they say. We're going to search the house. Everyone stay calm. Mlle, Mme, return to your rooms. No one is hiding here. What is this woman? We know that one escaped. Hiding here, at your home, in Montillac. So calm down, Fio. Mr. Fio. Commissioner, do you have a document, a piece of paper? Who authorizes you to break into my house. ? Let's not waste time. Go to work. Who is it. What's going on here? We need to search this house, Robert Yur. We think a terrorist who has taken refuge here is hiding like a rat. Well, do it as a commissioner, do it. Let me do it. Don't worry. He moved last night. MM. Enough now. You searched the house and saw that there was no one there. These are our rooms. Do you think a terrorist would hide in the room of a V. Amart officer? But Robert. Lieutenant, we have valuable information. Commissioner, I say enough. No, but wait, Mr. Few. Hauptmann. Kramer said enough. It's worth that you had a paper from Commander Tour. No, we don't have any. But time to obtain the hunting license, the game. Bye. Thank you Mr. You behaved like a true gentleman. Mr. Delmas. Please avoid English words these days. Play. Oh shit. What is it? The Racine group. My liaison. Another one. He got arrested. Meeting this evening before midnight at the Mayaks' house. It's a farm near Bechevel, in Saint Julien. I have to go. You ? But you're not going to go there. You're completely crazy. If you are caught, you will be shot. And then, how are you going to get there? By bike. There's one up there. I'm coming with you. Certainly not. It's too far away and it's night. Stay with your father and Camille. Tell me yes, I'll tell you no. I'm doing well. And you ? Do you remember when I was 10 eight years old? My birthday? With the car, we had an accident and you told me Lea, it's okay, it's okay Lea. Obviously, I remember it. When we kissed. The kiss, the 1st, the last. Until. Today. Don't make me suffer any more, please . Why am I making you suffer? Hold. Come on, come on. Quickly, the others are waiting for me and I. I'm late. What are you doing ? I try to continue. All these stories, these calculations that you don't have time to do. Of all. Way, I can't sleep. I constantly think of Laurent and of you too. I understood, you know. What did you understand? You, your father and Laurent, what you do. I feel so useless. What do you want? I'm tired. Stop looking at me like that. I'm not looking at you, I'm not looking at you anymore. For what ? We must understand, this is war, we are enemies. By the way, why your. Father was not. Not. At the station? I couldn't warn you, we were woken up in the middle of the night, a quarter of an hour later we were on the train. Fortunately I went through it anyway, right? Thank you Mr. Le Pieux. Regis. Call me Regis. And then it's not me who should. Thank you, it's Laval that's in charge. He is the car. Yousand. And so without the next generation, you will be. Still breaking rocks in your stalag. It's not. Beautiful homeland, eh Mathias? Isn't it beautiful? And when you go back to see your boss, don't think twice. What reflection? Father Delmas, after the harvest. 40 catastrophic, there were other schools in even more rotten ones, you see. But if, finally, his actions at the bank. In short, he had to mortgage his castle and sell the wolf wood. It's not possible. But yes, she rides a lot, a lot of bicycles. And after. After. Some, it's often that she happens. Lose. On the way. Why you do. The mysterious? But I. Don't be mysterious. But instead of handing over. Your clogs up there, come see me down there and you'll get boots and everything that goes with them. You see, I don't do anything mysterious. Leah. Mathias. Oh my God, you are beautiful. I had forgotten. Here. So how are you? It's not going well. What, Mathias, things aren't going well. Now the Germans are no longer our enemies. They won the war. The marshal said that. Marshal? Well yeah, the marshal. Do you know who it is? Really ? Listen, Lea, if things aren't going well in Montillac, if there are problems. Well, I mean money problems. Yes, there might be a solution. Oh yes ? Well yeah, money, my father, he has some. He even has quite a few. He put some aside for. For the day when I will settle down. It's your money, Mathias. You have to keep it. Yeah, I'm not saying. But finally yes. If what? You understand, if we got married, that might be a solution. Yousand after all, Montillac is for us. It's for both of us, together. Shut up, Mathias. You don't know what you're saying. Montillac belongs to my father. You have nothing to claim about that. Then the two of us. I love you, Lea, you know it. I love you. I will never marry you. Do you know why? Because I don't love you. Yes, I like you. Really, I don't like you. I don't know what to say. Goodbye, goodbye and thank you. There's nothing to say. It's a shame. The best thing is to say nothing. A period of restriction. Two words are missing. Like the rest. Auf geht's wir fahren los. But what? What's happening to you? Can you see me in your office? It's not unworthy of him, nor of me. Because he loves me and I love him. It's not unworthy to love yourself. But Francoise is our enemy. It is. Not him, huh? But we are at war. I know. He is the. Father of my child. And you, did you know? Yes. It's so much. He tries. No, you can't stay here. Where you want her to go. ? I relax. In Paris. Attention. He is a man of honor. He won't tell anyone. To no one. We don't doubt him. Aristide. Tell him. I have a lot to tell you. These last few months have been very effective. Thanks to Adrien and Aristide's brothers, we were able to connect with around thirty groups like Notre. Thanks to Helene, we were able to avoid a tragedy. As she left school, Helene heard someone bragging about her husband's exploits. And someone who was supposed to infiltrate our skies. Finally now part of the sky is with us and sending us planes. Airplanes? Yes, from London. With men, Weapons and words. And to understand these words, this information, these orders, we have to look. A package in Paris. I don't understand anything. A package with words, that's a bit like that. A radio, Anatole, a radio. There are plenty of them around here. When we hear the blue monkey is going to pick cherries, that doesn't move us forward. It is not the same. Radio that can go to Paris. Mr. Pierre, I have to go up V. The north. SO. I have an appointment with the notary for. My father's estate. Where is your notary, Paul? Master Mandelbaum, at Versailles. Mandelbaum? I'm afraid he won't be able to receive you. And me? You ? Yes, me. Well, I'm going to Paris. In Paris? I see your daughter Francoise. We can't let you run into such danger, Mlle. I have known Lea forever. And if he's with us, it's not just to serve coffee or wine. Y I have this in my pocket. When it was only spoken at that moment. You told me no. Have you thought about it? It's all thought out. Don't be a child, open it. No, I can't. I open it. It was my mother's. It's not worth it. There's no point in making me sad. I don't like you, Mathias. If I agree to be your wife, I will never let you be my husband. So don't ruin everything. Let's go MM. Ladies, Mlle. Goodbye Lea. Ah there, I think we are there. It is. Not a shame, but it's been a long time since we used it. Watch out, bunny. Pitou, pitou. Pitou, pitou. He didn't laugh. Keep smiling. It's good that you called this little boy after dad. Still nothing you and his father? I received a letter. I'll show it to you. Does he know now? Yes yes. Of course. Come on. Watch out, bunny. But what are you waiting for? Rock. Rock. Rock. Brother, you take it. The rabbit, you leave it to me. Coding. Come on, get my code. Phone, darling. You can go there. Yousand. Hello ? Yes, it's me, his sister, Marie Helene. Yes, yes, okay. Where? Well, goodbye. Y Lea, I have a surprise for you to see. By the way. Raphael, how did you know who I was. In Paris? Ah, from a mutual friend. Not that common anyway. Oh, it looks like Viviane Romance. Or rather Gillette Leclerc. I always confuse them. Why are they here? Why do they mix? Usual mix. Because some are. Strong, because others are weak. And you Raphael, why did you come? Me ? Because there is food and drink. I'm going to leave. Oh no, we just arrived. No. But I have a surprise for you. I don't like surprises. And then I'm not comfortable. But yes, look. No. You're going to say goodnight to Rudy. It's charming there. General von Folein's monocle. I call him von Fofoll. General von Follein. And Rudy Schumaister. I'm happy to see you Delphine. The only woman I've loved in my life. A love without return, alas. Excuse me for interrupting the conversation, but Mr. Malle, how is your name spelled? With an ax in the middle. Ah, an axe. Oh no, not with an h yet. What I knew. A Jewish bookseller in Dusseldorf. Abraham Malle. Are you wearing the star? I wear two. Look into the eyes. Here's your surprise. Raphael. Male. Are you okay? Alright. And you ? It's Lea. Leah. Leah. Does Lea see me? It is movement. Explained. Leah. Leah. You want to stop me. Eh ? I don't understand German. Come. Let me go. Are you okay, have you calmed down? Can we talk to each other? How did you know I was in Paris? And then it was you who sent Raphael. I know you are in Paris. Because I'm interested in you. Wer sind Sie? Was this what happened yesterday? Ich. Bin ein Freund von Alice Hepting. Entschuldigen Sie mich. Give me some news. Camille. Camille is in Montillac with her baby. And he's two years old. Lawrence. Lawrence. No news. No news. And Lea, what becomes of her? And you, take out the Boche women. Take them away. At your bosses' parties. Life is beautiful. Tell me about it. I'm fine. As for the boss women, I will call you back. Just my advice. Don't be fooled by appearances. I don't understand anything anymore. Who are you ? I'll tell you. I'll tell you everything. I promise you. I swear to you. Sarah Mulstein has been arrested. Sarah? I'm looking for news. There's someone here who might know where she is. I have to see him. Absolutely. I missed you so much. With a good bottle of wine. So. But what's with this bag? Doesn't it open? No, no, no. It's full. It is. For that. The bag is full to the brim. Who is it ? Let me in. Mme Lea. Raphael? What's happening to you? Can you hide me? Raphael? Wrong. A friend. Mmes. You can even hide me. A few hours? You hide. We don't have your hiding place. You have blood. We're going back. I'll make you laugh. I have. I was ironing my pillowcases. Their phone rings, and it's Francois. Francis? Yes, Francois. Like Agnes who warned me at the last minute. The Gestapo was in. The street. Yes, the Gestapo. Then. After, in. The Building. I was so scared that I am. Fell down the back staircase. Listen, first thing, you're going to sit down. Magnus is a nurse. She will give you the first care. You are going to bed him. Baby. You call Dr valdo straight away. Oh no, no, no. I don't need anything. No. No. Make yourself comfortable. Yes, Mme. We are running out of car. You're going to drink beer. Do you want a lemon beer? Quite stupid. I'd rather just be stupid. Realize, for me, falling down the back stairs really fell very low. I'm taking you with me. And where. ? At home, in Bordeaux. Do you have your papers? But when do you beat? Right away. Right away. I didn't even take my things. Bathroom. Do you think a young woman like you could have loved one. Young man like me at the time? What era? Well, back when I was a young man. Oh, but definitely. Do you know about Francois, until now, I thought nothing of it. But since this morning he saved my life, he makes a very good impression on me. Kontrolle y there's it, your bag. What's in there? Offnen Sie die Tasche. I think he's asking you if it's your bag. I know this isn't your bag. It's unfortunate, but we don't speak German. Aufmachen. No, no, wait. It's my bag. No, it's my bag. Aufmachen. I have laundry for my sister, a pocket for my father. Gifts or something. Shit. No. Gently. No, but slowly, I tell you. Good. Call auto Abetz. Do you know Auto Abetz? Nobody speaks it. French ? He is your ambassador in Paris. Auto Habetz. Oh, that's okay there. At home, I am still able to sit up on my own. No. I don't remember what it was like before. What was it like? The life. Don't say that. My boss. Please don't say that. Ship life will come. It's for. This is what we are fighting for. Do you think he'll come back, Raphael? Mass spending by the French. Everyone who struggles, everyone. Those who resist, all those who hope for this are there. Countless France. France always is. With General de Gaulle, Maurice Schuman. Replay Maurice Schumann's message to Francois. Maurice where he told him. You are France for short. Are you writing for me? My parents. But you're crazy. If we come across it. It's a mess for Camille. She's going to copy it down with spelling mistakes, like in prison. She will sign with her hand, but not understand it. Oh yes. Why does n't Camille bring me the newspapers? I don't know. It's her, it's me. What's the difference? ? A man must come tomorrow from Toulouse. He will bring another transceiver. If I'm gone, remember his name. It's 15. Like the number 15. If you left, yes. Here, I'm no longer of any use. I received a mission order from Mayenne. I'm leaving for London. For London? My God, Laurent, I didn't understand the beginnings. How long have you been sleeping with him? Before he married me or something? I pray. It is. Nothing ever happened. Yes. Children's friends. How can you do this to me? Hey, Camille. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. It's not to stop you from fighting. It's to fight me. Listen to me, Camille. Born to me is neither friendship nor love. It's from. The life. We were born together. We are like brambles, like thorns. We can't untangle ourselves. And you are my wife. But I'm going to lose you again. I don't want to. Forgive me. I should never have raised my hand. You. I lost my mind. If I were you, I would have lost it too. You are his wife. Did he tell you? He told us. Are you reassured now? He's leaving this evening. This evening ? Laurence and Lea. The smuggler, Martial, he won't come. Shit. They arrested him . He is sick. How did you know? By the week. You're soaked. You're going to get cold. Did you come all this way to warn me? Yes. This is madness. This is madness. I came to ask your forgiveness. Pardon ? Yes. Sorry for what happened with Camille. Dad. Just once. Love me, for one night. Since you speak, since we don't know. I love you. Lawrence. Lawrence. Martial? Yes, it's me. I'm making progress. I'm coming. It's not true, what you told me earlier when you arrived. No. You do what you wanted. Yes. I don't know. Bye. Goodbye, mon. Love. Stop at Weiss. Seen as I. Speaks German well. You are my fool. Mathias. You terrified me. It was for fun. What ? What are you doing. Here at this time? I can't sleep. I'm walking around. It's all beautiful, huh? Yes. Anyway. Your father, my father, our grandfathers, they have. Does all that. Mine with their hands, yours with their heads. In any case. Me, my hands, my. Head will never leave here. Nor my heart. I'm going back. Wait, wait. Come sit down. I didn't meet you by chance. I was waiting for you. I know you often go for walks at night with your bicycle. Your beautiful blue bicycle. I also know you have new friends. Like the Jew we arrested the other day. The faggot. You shouldn't talk like that, Lea. Listen. My father is ruined, my deck is lost. Unless we get together, you and me. You and I will work. We will save everything. You and me, this will never happen. Mathias. Kiss me. Kiss me. Kiss the son of the. Minion. Kiss your minion. My head. If he. Please, Aaron, leave me. You don't rape. How much I love you. Hey. Matthias. Matthias. My tears had been weapons and all my screams, guns. I would have known how to fight another war. Yousand. The young man hasn't played his shot yet. If he smells four of one, four 21. They had lost. It's going to be okay. Wait. Wait, Mathias. Sit down. Come on, go ahead. Let them see who you are. The 100 l hour of ease. Revenge. I am responsible for telling you too. It's not me, it's orders. No one should move. It's always a matter of adding the dead to the dead. Mr. Pierre, I think we need to kick the Germans out. And those who are with them too. Even if we continue to die. Die Geisseln werden um sechs. Uhr abends erschossen. The hostages will be executed at 10:00 a.m. sharp. Unless, of course, the culprits made themselves known or were denounced before this time. Nicht anfassen. Komm. Komm. The body. Was taken away by the German police, but he you. Will be returned, of course. GOOD. My condolences. I understand your grief. The only ones responsible for this unfortunate death are the anti-France terrorists. The only ones are fakes. Say it around you. Bye. She will sleep at -20 4 a.m. Don't be surprised. Poor thing. She almost tore her soul out from crying so much. Leave it. Sleep. Sleep, my angel. Sleep. Sleep long. Francis. It's horrible what happened. How did you know? By chance. I'm in the area on business. What's your business? It's business. Do you have any news from Laurent? No. You have some. I assure you. What ? I find you different. Different from who? Only you, Camille. Don't ask me any questions. In the meantime, I'm going over you. As long as it's anything, don't hesitate. Camille. Camille. I'm hungry. I'm going to ask Suzanne something. THANKS. Please, Malela. You don't have to say thank you. You know, during all those weeks where. You had a fever, or you were delirious, I could hear you, you were calling for your poor dad. But so does Laurent. And I, sometimes, understood better what Laurent was saying. We are together, tangled like clinging thickets. Look at this little child. He owes you his life. Like Laurent, like me. We can no longer disentangle ourselves from each other. Camille. It's you. ? Lawrence? Lawrence. Lawrence. I will leave before daybreak. This war. When will it end? And you ? I have to participate in an operation in the region in a few days. All these deaths, my God. All these deaths. What madness. He goes to see Camille. But. She's waiting for you. I don't know anything. I don't know anything. What are you doing? But leave it. She has nothing. Done, good. Blood. That's enough, Mlle delmas. That's enough. You're going to get in the car, too. You don't scare me. YOU. Haven't had your fill of innocence. Is that it? We know that Laurent of Argilaf, sent by. London, codenamed Beaunier, passed through the region a few days ago. He participated in several attacks in Bordeaux and near Toulouse. Mother of clay will tell us what she knows, after which she is free. Grandma. Grandma. You women. It's nothing, my darling. Mom will come back. You wait for me. You stay with Suzanne. With them. I'll go with the MM. Don't you talk? But no. Not long. It will depend on you. Don't be afraid, since you don't know anything. Francois, nutmeg. Happy Sunday, Mmes. But wait, wait. Take a vest, something. Let's go. Mom. Mom. Mom. Nutmeg. Come on, let's go. Leave again. For the rabbit, huh? Have you seen the time, Francois? Plus four. Where is she? What did you do with it? What did you do with Camille? I. Warn you, Mathias. If anything happens to him, I'll kill you. Do you understand? Don't make me angry, Lea. Camille Dargila was arrested by the police at the request of Commander Tour. And you know why? Because there are. Reasons. Reasons? Reasons. But you know very well that she doesn't know anything. Maybe she's the wife of an anti-France terrorist. Maybe. That She knows more than you. But you don't like that, do you, Laurent? A terrorist. My poor boy. Poor boy? But I'm not a poor boy. And he's a terrorist. Lawrence. Lawrence. And he's even a communist who calls himself Beaunier. But you know him well. How does a communist go down? Oh, that's okay. Don't touch me. Mathias Fayard, I hate you. And. The worst. The worst thing is that my tia, what. Drip pastel for making you grow up. We're going to let her languish, the communist's wife. We'll see if you still make her disgusted. What madness. But what madness. What happened to you? The head? And if he comes to arrest you now, under any pretext, what will become of the little boy sleeping up there and therefore irresponsible? It revolted me when I saw them take Camille, the trio. The death of my father put me away from action. I take my place in the middle of. You, I will do anything. We no longer do anything. The resistance is an army. We need soldiers. Can I be a soldier? You can, but I don't want to. And Camille? What do you want. What should I do? It's more than just praying, that's it. ? Oh, pray. Yes, we can pray. How do you see it, God? Who is Adrien with? I understand more. Me neither. How can he let all this happen? I tried to explain it to others. And now I can't explain it to myself anymore. God is absent from this war. All these. Assassinations, these tortures, all these horrors. Y the yellow canvases, the sealed evacuation trains. V. The east. As they say. If we win, the rest of our days won't be enough. Mourning what we saw. And these trains going God knows where. Yes, yes, God knows. They take children away to death. Whole families. V. A horrible death. For what ? Be patient. Oh, my darling. I wouldn't have seen him again. He wouldn't even have known his little one. Son. Please open. Allow me to enter. Olea, this is your aunt Lisa. Open, I. Beg you. Leave. Go away. Leave me. I don't want to see you anymore. Did you see the colonel's face? The one who never laughs? Oh. Das hat er noch nie erlebt. He had to laugh once. Like Hitler when he put Paris in his pocket. Richtig. Oh. Oh. But I see my young cousin. You were already there. And what is the price? Fraulein Fernando. Mlle. Fernand. Mlle. So, MM. See you here tomorrow, at the same time. Bismorg. Bismarck. Mlle. How could you arrange to meet me here with you, your dirty friends? Why not the tower commander? Listen, I arranged to meet you here because you wanted to see me urgently. I was here when your message was passed on to me. I suppose you want to tell me about Camille. At my house. My arm. No, thank you. Ah, if you missed me, I am very touched. You don't have time to take you, have so much mind to. Make people laugh. An occupying army is a thankless and tiring task. And we grant many privileges to. The one that distracts you. It is for these privileges that you have come to be their jester. It is indeed for these privileges that you came to me. See ? No. However, I must tell you that you made this entire trip for nothing. That's what I've already done. What did you come to ask me? Camille was transferred from Fort du Ha to Merignac camp this morning. What ? Yes. And when will she be released? You're asking a little too much of me. For now, it's only a 1st step. Be patient. And it's her who should be asked to be patient? While you shine in the. Dinners, she walks in the mud. There is mud in the dinners too. Do you know that Raphael is dead? He was tortured for more than a month. He understood my commitment to that of Montillac, but he said nothing. My uncle told me about the V. East evacuation. Is it true that they even kill children? I think it's even worse than you can imagine. But how. How can you even do that. Look at them or talk to them, make them laugh? I can't tell you anything. Trust me. For the love of God, do. Me trust. For what ? I had a childhood friend. He became a militiaman. One night, two years ago, in the countryside, he raped me. I have to leave. You have to stay. I don't have all of you. You said it. I made love with Laurent. I knew that. Why are you telling me? Don't talk to anyone about this anymore. Neither to me nor to you. I love you. Do you mind if I take mom's mirror? No, no. Take it. You don't want to stay a day. Moreover ? Poto won't be here until you. I can't. I can't stay in Paris. Little Laurent needs me and I have to visit Camille. Lea, I know well what can be intolerable for you. He's a German. So he's a monster. Not all Germans appeared overnight. Don't judge. I love him. I love it so much. I know. I. Know. Forgive me for yesterday. No, you. Pardon. Forgive me. Are you still my little sister? Yes. Come back. For you. Don't forget me. Don't forget Camille. I asked you to trust me. Let me wait quietly for his body to be returned to me. Is that it? Listen carefully. Either way, take care of yourself. Don't be impudent. You too, be careful. Me. ? And. Why? Your French and German friends. You have very poor attendance. You have changed a lot since last night. GOOD. You don't change. And I pity you. Well since you don't understand anything , go to the end of the war. Who are you meeting with? The wind victims or the dead? Suzanne told me you were coming to see me. Yes, Mr. Fayard. Mr. Fayard. Can I sit down? It won't be necessary. You won't need your glasses. You know perfectly well what is written there. Let's go straight to the end. This is the most interesting. When the last four payments have been made by Mr. Victor Fayard, the mortgage on the property constituting the place called Domaine de Montillac will therefore be entirely lifted for his exclusive benefit. What does this mean? Finally Leah. Mlle Delmas, finally. You know very well that even before. Death of your poor father, god and. His soul was discomfiture, bankruptcy. And then when? The bank knew that Mr. Pierre had passed. Wanted to seize, dismember and sell the property. You were sick. There was nothing to do. I paid. That's a lot of money. Yes. I had worked all my life. I had savings, that's all. No victor, that won't be all. Today the scale was missing 20,000 bottles. Who did you sell this wine to? I sold it, yes. To whom? Those who wanted to buy it. Those who could pay. To the Germans. They weren't all German, mind you. You wanted this area at all costs. Any price. But not only victor, you're not the boss yet. It remains vice versa. And I will stop you from doing it with the money you stole from Montillac. Well, I didn't steal anything at all. We had to take care of the most pressing needs. Montillac and. YOU. Montillac and I are the same thing. Montillac is Montillac. Shut up. I thought we would get better after Zweitausendein. That's it, it's arranged. You're going to sign this for me and you're leaving. What is this ? You acknowledge having sold. For your account. Wine that didn't belong to you. And you are served. From this money to raise the mortgage on Montillac for your benefit. I am signing an acknowledgment of debt on your debt. Late salaries. I beg to leave. To leave? Go and do your business with the Germans elsewhere. That's not possible. I was born here, like you. My wife is buried in the cemetery behind. If I leave, you can't do that either, Victor. You couldn't do that. So now go. Goodbye, Victor. Yousand. You can't imagine hiding stuff in. Places again. But you look like a joke. Are you going to see your fiance? Well, anyway, it's none of my business. You are going to see my colleague, there opposite. YOU. Who are you here for? You find the infirmary. Leah. Your hands are burning. You have a fever. ? It's okay, it's okay. Visits are prohibited to the infirmary. I had to get up. And my Laurent? He is handsome, Laurent. He's funny, intelligent. You talk about yourself all the time. I'm waiting for you. Hey, he's the one. It's for you. What did they do to you? What did they do to you, Camille? Tell me. I'm exhausted, but it's okay. It's not hot, is it? I'm going to get you out of here, Camille. But how are you going to get me out? I don't know. I'll get there, I'll tell you. Promise. THANKS. THANKS. You know, I think about you all the time. I am a believer, but I believe in you. First, tell me more about Laurent. Which ? Both. Are they okay? This rain will come for all this little arsenal in three weeks, maybe less. It depends on the landing. So is it true? Are they going to show up? Yes, it's true. Tell you when? I don't know, I haven't decided yet. Must. Let me talk to you. We have to do it. Escape Camille. It's impossible. And we can't hire one. Such a violent action for one person. The risks are too high, Yousand. And for her, then? She's going to die. And that's not a huge risk. No, Lea. Mayenne formally opposes this. Mayenne? Mayenne Mayenne? But who is this Mayenne? We are an army at war. Mayenne sends us orders and we obey. Lea, for the moment, there is nothing we can do for Camille. Do you believe me? So you finally came. V. Me. Especially if you had some. Envy. We love each other. You didn't know it, but I knew it. If you want, I can go get you. What you want, you just have to say. Because with me, you'll have everything you want. Now I have become not the leader, but a leader nonetheless. And that changes everything. For now, I'm going here, it's temporary. And later you will see. What if we get married? No, no. I say if we get married, we don't need to do anything. Rush. But if we get married, we will live at home, in Montillac. Of course, it will be necessary. Let my father come back. You were very hard on him, Lea. It hurt me a lot. I forgive you. Give, since you are here. I'm fine. I'm very warm. You must, my darling. Is your mom coming back soon? Yes. I love you. Yes, I love you. Mom. Mom. Adrien was informed of his releases. You asked me to. Bring her back here. Now you have to. Let me go again. Thanks, Eric. Goodbye, Mlle. You. Are you in pain, mom? We can see. The prisoners? Prepared, strong in maintaining order. I came to you. Say thank you. Sit down. No. I saw what I wanted. And you saw this. What you wanted. You. Will never touch me again. Did you understand? Farewell. Mathias. Wait, Lea. We need to talk, all three of us. With my father. Neither with you nor. With him. Women don't matter. Look at me. My son. Me. Also, I believed in it, both of you. Together when you were 10. Leah. And you, the little good kids. Look what you've become. It's more your father who talks to you. It's more your father that you listen to. It's another one. This kind of. I can't even find the words. You 're someone else too now. So I'll tell you something, Lea. Even if she threw me out like no big deal, well, I wish her a man other than you. I'll let you eat with your bastard friends. Sit down and eat. Those of the Glieres plateau. Last month, now, the Vercors, the militia is unleashed. We have planned actions for May 1st. You can count on. How many men? About sixty. Approximately. Yours, Aristide. And then on the three farms near Pessac. It won't just be men. GOOD. Let them be ready on the evening of the 30th. At the stonemason's. Rick, it's me. How is she? Better. And you ? Do you have anything for her? I like it better. I'll go up with it. Tonight, you can't. It's too dangerous. I got noticed. I know, but I want to see her because I don't know when I can come back. Afterwards, I found out that it was a militiaman who allowed her to be freed. It's strange, isn't it? And after these days, are you going to stay there? I'm leaving for Agen afterwards. I know. I don't know. You went to great lengths for her. Is it so hard to say thank you? It's so difficult. So you have nothing to say? Too much ass. It's me, Aristide. Hurry up. Quickly, quickly. Loic was arrested last night. They kept him talking all night. He's dead, the poor thing. Quickly, quickly. Who could have denounced him? Now is not the time, Mr. Laurent. You have to save yourself, there. You, on your side. And you, Mme, with the little one. We need to wake everyone up. The militia will be here in less than 10 minutes. I'll take you, except you. Oh, but stop the outpourings, my love. Come on, please. Take care, I beg you. Yes. Come on, Lea. Come on. Suzanne, are you coming? No, no. What can happen to me? A good-for-nothing. I'm French, I've done nothing else. It's not a crime, then. Come on, please, Suzanne. No, no. Come on, hurry up. And then, what will keep my mutti jak? We take care of the house and you take care of the reserve. Here they are, the 1ers shutters. Look at this. Isn't that wonderful? Release. Cute Zweitausendein. There's no one here at the move, Aristide. I don't want to stay here. Do nothing. I will be useful for something. If you feel like it. Mlle Lea, we need everyone. Stop calling me Mlle. Colonel, here are your guests. THANKS. Nice work. What are you doing here? You are ahead. The war is not over. You are Mayenne, I knew it. I have to leave. Go see a soldier. Take care of yourself. Goodbye my. Colonel. Here we go. I dreamily followed the lonely path, we say. I followed the lonely path with dreamy steps . Maurice had a good Christmas we say. Maurice had a good Christmas. Yousand the landing Yousand will take place one of the next three nights. Until then, we will continue our action. The war against war. I came with those from the Sidouane farm. They were in danger because they were denounced. We are not safe here. We will leave this farm tomorrow morning. One last thing. I wanted to say thank you. Thank you for your courage, your faithfulness and your faith. Lea, I wanted to tell you. He wanted to kill my father. I'm hungry, I'm thirsty. But no, you're not thirsty. Yes, I'm scared, I'm tired. And other than that, Mr. Everything okay? Come on, come on. You give me the tickets, right? THANKS. Yes, thank you very much. I don't have any tickets, I don't have any money. But I have this. It's for resistance. I'll take you off your bike. Come on, quickly. Come on, run. Francoise, my darling sister, I created you from somewhere in my life. I don't even know where anymore. In the middle of the. France in any case. In a school, at the end of a village. There's no one left thanks. To war. As a child we met earlier told me . I say we. Because little Laurent, Camille's son, is with me. Francoise, Camille is dead. I will tell you these things. Incredibles. I want to join you in Paris. I think of those Sundays when Mom and Dad took us to the edge of. The sea when it was bad. Today, it is the earth that is unleashed. I kiss you. Leah. Why is she on the ceiling, Lea? Because if the planes, the Germans suck, their noses. Back there, she will warn us. And you, little bastard. Do you think they are good? Adios. Adios. Oh, you're alive. But what happened to you? Between. Between. Albertine. Albertine, come quickly. It's Lea. But it's Lea. It's not possible. But who is this little boy? He is the child of Laurent and Camille. In. The kitchen. Come on, my little turd. I get a good snack. Jerusalem artichoke. What are Jerusalem artichokes? You'll see. It's good. It's excellent. You will say words to me. Her mother, Camille, died. Adrien too. Militiamen killed resistance fighters who were on a farm where we were taking refuge. It was a massacre. I had a letter to Francoise. I never posted. Is she there, Francoise? She didn't kill, to come? Well no. No. It would be better if you went to see her yourself. She's in your parents' bedroom. Spit on it, even worse . All this screaming. The screams of women. And. Little Pierre, at a neighbor's house. They are not. He is injured. He. East. Prisoner in the Vosges. What. Injury ? I don't know. I don't know. He confided in a nurse. It was his wife who reported me. Francoise. Excuse me. You don't know an officer called Laurent d'Argilin? He's over there. Lawrence? Lawrence. It's true ? You kissed me very hard when I. Was sleeping. Of course it's true. Yes. Camille. 10 November 8, 1940. Four. Leah. Dear. I finally got what I wanted. The right to fight. Imagine that they wanted to make me a prefect. After four years spent under the gold and paneling, bowing and bowing.
