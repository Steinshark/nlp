[Laughs] I laugh at a lot of things for absolutely no reason. Quite a few of the creators I've met have said I'm one of the giggliest people they know. [Laughs] And I just... I just laughed at that. What am I doing? To be honest, I completely agree with them. It's really hard to be completely stoic-faced when you're dealing with mods like these. [Laughs] Oh... When they take damage, it's just a vine boom. Ugh... So today, as I stand in this completely normal place to be recording a video, I set myself a challenge to not laugh. I put this out on my community tab for you guys to give me some of the craziest, most hilarious mods you could find. And today, I'm gonna go through this Google Doc and see, uh, what you gave me. CHOOOOCOLATEEEE And hopefully not laugh at them. Today I'm only allowed three laughs before I have to completely end the video. So depending on how long this video is, uh, you might be able to tell how well I did. Either that or we decided to fill half this video with just complete silence. [Silence] Alright, so let's browse a little bit here. Here's the form that I set up for this, and there are 360 responses. I wanna see- Oh... My gosh. Look at how ridiculous this is. I'm just gonna go in here, and I'm just gonna see what we can do. I need to stop laughing! I need to stop- Okay, that doesn't count. [Laughs] Alright, starting right now. I have three lives, and I cannot laugh. Keep track of those lives on screen, and we're just gonna end the video if I laugh three times. Gonna find out if I can even do this, cause I don't- [Laughter] Uh, did that- That doesn't count! No! Ah! That was an exhale! [Laughs] Doesn't count. I'm way too giggly for this. Alright, here we go. Here we go. This is- This is what I'm doing. Okay, some of these I do know. I've seen a few of these. Uh, I'm very interested to see some of the things I haven't seen. Trumpet skeletons. I think I've seen that one. I think I've seen that. I do wanna try to find Ferit's, because I know Ferit put one in here. Ferret. Cursed villagers, huh? Oh no. Oh no- Oh no! Oh no! Turns all villagers into variations of the bald Steve from the Lego announcement. Question? Why? Answer. Why did they do this? Give his hair back. He's just a little guy. He is just a little- What did they do to him? I'm so concerned. I'm so concerned. Alright, here we go. Hoppin' into a world. Oh, don't worry about the- Why is this called Well done Netherite? This one's called Well done Netherite Smithing Template? That's not even part of the mod. That was just- That was just me doing a thumbnail for that almost. That almost actually got me. I was not expecting that. Oh no! Oh! Oh! This is really funny though. I'm not gonna lie. Okay. Oh no. Oh no. I'm like really- This is a- This is painful! I like really have to hold back on this. Oh my gosh. Look at you. What have they done to you? What did they do to you, man? Look at you. Look at this. I actually kind of like the hat though. Are those hats like a thing I can get? I kind of want the hats. Can I get the hats, man? Oh, it's so cursed. They're just bald Steve. What's going on, man? Are you okay? Like, what did they do to you? Hey guys, it's me. One of you guys. I blend in here. I fit- I fit in. This doesn't count. None of this counts as laughing. I'm gonna just move away. Thank goodness they have the same sounds. If they had like oof sound effects, that would have killed me. That would have destroyed me. Oh man. That would have been- That would have been rough. Oh my gosh. I have to like figure out how to not just giggle at everything. Everything is so funny to me in this game. I don't know why, but I get- Oh. Why did I forget that I had that on? Why did I forget that I had that skin on? I guess I have to keep that skin on for a bit. Okay. All right. I need to move on. I need to move on. This is- This is really funny, but it didn't quite get me. It didn't quite get me. NightOfWar87 said, &quot;Premium funny cows.&quot; Okay. Goin to this. &quot;Premiums funny cows.&quot; Description. &quot;Everyone knows them and everyone loves them, except those weird people who don't.&quot; &quot;This mod adds funny blue cows that run around fast and have an amusing ending?&quot; &quot;They also drop a new food item that has its utilities when used properly.&quot; Oh boy. Oh boy. We're doing this one, I guess. There is one jar file. That's it. That's all we get. One jar. No need for updates. Who needs updates? Updates are over rated. Funny cows. Here we go. We're going to see these funny cows for the first time. They better be funny or I'm- I don't know what I'll do, but not laugh. I'm not going to laugh anyways though. So. Ha. Dang it. Does that count? That doesn't count. That was a word. Ha is a word. Ha is a word, not an accidental laugh. Okay. Alright. Where are these funny cows? Where are they? Oh. Oh. There's one. Hey, funny cow. How are you? How's it going? They told me you have a funny ending, huh? Oh. Oh. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Speed. Okay. Alright. Okay. Gimme your funny ending. Let me see the funny ending. Let's find out. Let's see what the funny ending is. What's it going to be? What's it going to be? Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. You know, I was expecting that. I actually- I actually figured that was probably what the funny ending was. So. We're good. We're good. We're good. I'm thriving. See, explosions are funny, but they're not that funny. Oh wow. That is- that is an explosion right there. Oh my gosh. I was told there is a food item that also goes along with this. Where is the said food item? Did we get the food item? Where I'm kind of concerned that it might have been lost in the explosion. That sure would be unfortunate. Um. Hmm. I'm seeing a lot of items, but not a lot of food going on. Maybe we just need more cows. You know, maybe we need more cows. Maybe we need more funny cows. Let's find out. Oh gosh. I forgot. I forgot about that. Funny cow spawn egg. Here we go. Alright. Alright. I've also given myself strength. They blow up. And then I did see an item that was dropped by the cow. Wait. Hold on. That was- that was funny. Okay. But where's the- where's the food? Hold on. What? Oh. Oh, that would do it. That- that would do it. That would- that would make sense. I'm just gonna- oh. Just gonna eat that. Yeah. Nice. Alright. Um. Title screen. Good. Close. Was pretty funny, but not quite close enough. Not quite enough. I'm too good at this. I'm too good at not laughing. That's not true. I'm really bad at this. Sans4974 says Mo-yai. Is that how you pronounce that? I don't actually know how to pronounce that. Is it Moai? Mo-yai? Mo-yai. Mo-yai. Mo-yai. Mo-yai. Okay. Mo-yai mod. Here we go. It apparently just- oh. Oh. Oh. For the record, this gif doesn't have music going on behind it, so I bet there's something insane playing right now. This is- wow. Okay. Phew. Okay. Mo-yai facts adds Moyai out of your game. What else would you want from a mod? Can be found rarely in patches on beaches or more frequently in mushroom islands. Can be greeted once a day? Will randomly move during a full moon? Will talk to each other when in a group can eat soap? Alright. I'm confused. I'm concerned, honestly. I guess we're setting up an instance for this one. Oh boy. Here it is. Oh boy. I'm not gonna lie. I'm concerned about this. No! I don't want to. I won't lie to you. I'm a little bit concerned that this one is going to be absolutely hilarious. I gotta- I gotta really prep my mindset here. I gotta really be ready for this. They eat soap and they teleport around when it's nighttime? I don't know what I'm- I don't know what I wanna see here. I really gotta- I gotta change that skin, man. It's gonna be Duolingo now. Alright. Here we go. M-yai. I'm so concerned. I'm so concerned right now. Alright. I'm on a beach. Do they- do they spawn on beaches? Oh! Oh! Here they go. Here they go. Hey guys! How's it going? How you doin'? How's it going? Yo, Angelo. Angelo. That was it? That was all I could do? That was- that was it. Yo, Angelo. Okay, they eat soap, you said? Wait, what- how to- what is soap? There's not soap. What's- what? They can be crafted into fireworks stars? Oh, I'm on the wrong version. Dang it! Three hours later. Alright, now we're in the right version. Let's see- let's see what happens here. Okay, you can greet them. Yo, Angelo. What is Angelo? Don't understand the Angelo part of that. Still no soap, so that's cool. You can stack them. Okay, do they do anything else? They have a unique note block sound. [Loud rumbling] It's like a vine boom. But- but not. [Loud rumbling] That is kind of funny that it isn't- this is the right one. Oh man. They're affected by gravity and will deal a lot of damages when falling on entities. They do. They do fall. Okay. Uh, pig. Take that. [Loud rumbling] This is going well. Uh, this is going great. I'm gonna find a mushroom island. This is going far better than I expected. I'm not going to lie to you. Look at them. Look at them all. Look at them all. They're everywhere. The wild pack of Moyai in the natural habitat. Yo, Angelo. Nope. That doesn't count- no way. No, that doesn't count. Please don't know how to count. That doesn't count. Right? That doesn't count. Look at them. Look at them. The weirdos. The weirdos that they are. Okay. They said it moves around at nighttime. Hold on. It has to be a full moon. I think it's a full moon. Hmm. I'm gonna place a note block on top of each one of these. And if- it said, &quot;Yo, Angelo.&quot; If they move, I'll know about it. Oh. It's moving. He's moving. Do they teleport at all or anything? Do- or they- they just spin. He's spinning. Bro, he's spinning. These are- this is a- I just realized like the- what I'm looking at right now. And it's just really funny to me. I don't know why. But they spin. Also, &quot;Yo, Angelo.&quot; What does it mean? I just remembered that I'm the Duolingo skin. And this is a- this is a wild scenario I find myself in right now. This is an insane scenario that I find myself in right now. Look at them all. Look at them. They're just everywhere. The fact that they're spinning around is pretty cool. I'm not gonna lie. I'm not gonna lie. You! Moobloom! Hah! Yeah! Another one! Yeah! Another one! All right. They don't do enough damage, I don't think. All right. Okay. Whoo. All right. This one was pretty funny. I'm not gonna lie. I think it- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. That's an insane- that's a crazy- You don't want the seed. There it is. There you go. Enjoy. That's insane. Anyways, this has been a crazy scenario. Duolingo burned out. I need to really hold back, man. This is rough. I feel like I've been a little bit giggly this whole time, but I don't think they've quite counted yet. So we're getting there. I still have all three of my lives, thankfully. I'm still going. But there's so many more of these. Look at this spreadsheet. Like, look, just- Just take a moment to appreciate what 360 mods looks like. That's insane. That's so much. Goofy armors from Smash Dragon. Hold on. Goofy armors. Okay. Have you ever wanted to make armor with some of the silliest recipes ever? Me neither, but if you're into that, then all right. Little- Phew. Yeah. This mod contains multiple armors with ridiculous recipes. The names of each armor represent the materials, tools, armor you need to craft them. Gotcha. Why is there a comma here? The world may never know. There are also some impossible recipes like water armor, air, and dragon egg armor. Some possible recipes include netherite, sword armor, light blue bed armor, glowing item frame armor, and many, many more. Oh gosh, are there images? There are no images. There's just one file. All right. Here we go. I mean, how funny can armor really be, though? Right? Like, how funny- How funny could it be? All right, Duolingo Bird, we're on an adventure now. We're out here to find the weirdest armor we could possibly find. And by that, I mean go to- Not spectator mode. Creative mode. Goofy armors. Oh my gosh. Creeper head armor? Do these look weird or something? No. No, they don't. No, they don't. They don't look weird. They don't look weird at all. They just look like normal armor sets, but they probably just have the dumb recipes. Phew. That's- Oh, no. No, wait. Oh, why? No, that doesn't count, right? No, that does count, doesn't it? That's got to- Oh, man. Oh, that's such a stupid one to laugh on, too. Man. Oh, man. You see what I mean? I'm too giggly for this. All right, I just want to try on the water set. Hold on. Hold on. Look at me. I'm in water armor. Does this give me- It's not even like full diamond. It's just- These don't even do anything else, do they? They don't do anything. They don't do anything. They don't- They literally just have stupid recipes. That's the point? That's the point of the mod? I'm gonna go insane by the end of this video, man. This is so dumb. All right. All right, fine. That's one. That's one. Not even- I'm not even gonna open that back up again. That's so- That's so funny. Ahh. From therelhuman, Z mod. Give a short description of what this mod has to offer. Um, CAPTCHA. CAPTCHA? There are also emerald tools and bananas in the mod. Do I need to be concerned about this one? I feel like I should be concerned about this one. Wait a minute. Hold on a minute. How did- What? A mod based on SystemZee and Knarfy from YouTube. Just a funny little goof of a mod that is funny. Do you like Knarfy? If you answered yes to both, then this is the mod for you? What is in this mod? What is about to happen? What is this? What is- I need to play this right away. I'm so concerned. Forge, okay. I feel like I've seen something about this in my Discord server, but I haven't, like, actually played this. I'm very concerned. This- Uhh... It adds dimensions, ores, biome, emerald tools, and more thetans. They have plans to add SystemZee and Knarfy mobs. Fill the whistleblower? Wait, what? Who is fill the whistleblower? Knarfy Wither Zee Warden and Egg. Okay, alright. We will watch the development of this mod very closely. Not really, but maybe. Okay, they said new biome, new mobs. Where do the Knarfy and SystemZee mobs- Oh, do they not exist yet? Oh, they don't exist yet. Okay. Two new dimensions. Oh my gosh. Knarfy Land? There is a Narfi Land. There is- What? What is this? What can I- Is there a- It's a bedrock up top? This is- What? This is so dark. Hold on. Oh my gosh. This is so purple. This is a lot. Alright, there's your screenshot. Knarfy in Knarfy Land. There it is. We did it. We made it. Knarfy is in Knarfy Land He did it. He's here. Alright, okay. What else do I do? What else is in here? Knarfy ore, block of Knarfy? That's just called Knarfy. Why is that just called Knarfy? Banana- Why is a banana block considered something that- What? What? Okay. Banana block of Knarfy. It's TNT. Can I light it? No way this is like actually explosive. Okay, I was gonna say. I was like, that would be crazy. Oh, I betcha this is how you make the portal, huh? This is how you make the portal. Oh, is it the banana blocks? Is that how you make a portal to get here? The answer is no to either of those. So that's a- What? There's a- What? Power of the sun? What? What does it do? What does the power of the sun do? Might not be in the right world. Hold on. Power of the sun. Go. Power of the sun. It does nothing. Okay. These are all SystemZee things. Look at me. I'm holding a SystemZee sword. It's got a mustache and everything. It has 14 attack damage. Oh my gosh. Why did I get a tool like this? I love that the shovel has the eyes and the mustache on the handle. Not on the actual part where it would be. That was an exhale out. That's not a laugh. That was an exhale out. It doesn't count. You can't prove to me that that was a laugh. I mean, you probably could, but I'm not gonna accept it. I'm stuck in my ways. Look at- This is actually like- This is actually kind of solid. Why didn't I get tools? Why didn't I get any tools? You can get the Knarfy Ore. Why didn't I get- Get on it. You're working emerald sword. Oh, there's emerald armor. But the armor's not in the- in the armor tab. Oh my go- Oh, there's no- there's no armor. It's just- It's just these. You know what? That's not too shabby. This also has 15 attack dares. That's even better than the SystemZee sword. Alright. This is- This is cool. This is neat. I definitely didn't laugh. I definitely- I didn't. I didn't do it. I- That was an exhale. That was an exh- I exhaled. It's not- It's not the same thing. Whoo! Okay, bye. I'm just- That's- Alright. Whoo! Deep breaths. Deep breaths. Meme in a bottle. Mrbysco created this apparently. Memes in bottles? Any specific features and nerves you tried? Not really. All memes? Gotcha. Oh boy. I'm- I'm a little concerned again. I don't know what memes are gonna be in this. Hopefully we can show this. Meme in a bottle. This mod is inspired by a tweet from Pymar where he joked about an idea for a mod called Meme in a Bottle on Twitter. That's funny. The dish is, you know, okay, alright. List of memes currently in the mod? A lot. Alright, cool. That's all we get to see before I go into the versions. I did see that there was a Bee movie thing of some sort. A reference to the Bee movie? This could be the end of me. I won't lie to you. This could be the end of me. I am also very excited to try this one out. Welcome back to the world where I lost a life. Uh, we're gonna see if I lose another one. Alright, meme in a bottle. Oh my gosh. Splash meme in a bottle. Memes will rise from where this bottle lands. You might want to find out how to make them more effective. Wherever it lands, there's some multiple memes. Alright, we'll keep that one. Sunglasses deal with it. Can I put these on? I probably can't put that in for the second copyright, but oh yeah. Alright, let's see what happens. Splash bottle of meme, here we go. Chocolate! Chocolate! Chocolate! Oh my gosh. He's really... He's... Wow. Whoo! Chocolate! Chocolate. Alright, what's next? Hi, Charlie. Charlie bit me. That's a good meme too. Good meme. Alright, come on. what? WOMBO COMBO!! Jeez, okay. K. Don't tell me I just said &quot;okay&quot; and it said &quot;kay&quot;. That's right! Get no scopes! Get no scopes! No scoped classic. Congratulations. You won. Thanks. Hi, Billy Mays here for Oxy Clean, the stain specialist. Billy Mays! It's over 9000! Do a barrel roll! Do a barrel roll! Do a barrel roll! And the Oscar goes to... Me! I got the Oscar! WOW! WOW! This doesn't do anything else, does it? This is completely useless. This is just an Oscar. Alright. No! Wait, no! I laughed at myself. I laughed at myself. No. Okay, that has to count. I guess that has to count. Dang it, man! I'm just gonna throw a bunch of them down. I'm just gonna see what happens here. What else can I get that just appears? Okay, alright, that's so dumb. Oh my gosh. Alright, fine. It got me. It got me. I don't even think I've seen everything this mod has to offer. This is an insane mod. This is so insane. Look at all these things. Saxophone. Alright, alright. We need to move on. That's enough of that. I'm moving on. I'm moving on from that one. Whoo! Oh my gosh. This is a wild video. This is so much. That was a good one. That was a good one. Well done. Well done, Siege. Well done. There is another Knarfy mod. Galax just put my mod in there. That's really funny, actually. That's good. That's good. That's from another video. Okay, that's good. Good job. Good job, Galax. That was good. There is another Knarfy mod. Um... This mod adds me to the game. Find the Knarfy structure and see what's on his mind. I'm not sure I want to, but I guess we're doing that now. Thank you, Brentson Gaming, for your contribution. Who suggests this one? Also, Galax. Thanks, Galax. Appreciate it. Or maybe I don't. I'm not sure yet. Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Gotta find the Knarfy structure. See what's on my mind. Knarfy is about to talk to Knarfy. What a world we live in. It doesn't count. I wasn't in the mod. This is... I wonder... I wonder where the Knarfy structure... Where could it be? Where could it be? Okay, can I like get in somehow? There's a lot of shoulder boxes. Can I like... I guess I'm going up... I went up my leg and that's... I found... I found a lot of me up there. Breaking Minecraft. Breaking Minecraft. Woah. Breaking Minecraft. Oh my gosh! It's me! It's me! It's just my voice too! That's... That's insane! That's insane! That's insane! You just get close! Breaking Minecraft. with your dumb ID. - Breaking Minecraft with your dumb ID. - Okay, okay, we're guys so loud. You so, I'm so, I'm so loud. Dang it. I don't know. (dramatic music) I'm gonna turn down the mask. Hey, me? Do I attack me? Do I, can I like, can I, can I, do I drop anything? No, I just, I'm just, I'm just really loud. I'm trying to take none of these things as a personal attack right now, you know? I'm trying not to, I don't drop anything. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not, I won't fight back. Actually, I won't fight back is actually kind of a, probably a good thing. Gosh, these, you could do some just horrible things to these poor Knarfys, man. Like these guys, they're just, they're just out here. Also, why does it spawn so much? There's so many, there's so many of them. I don't want this video to end, but this is really, this is also very funny. This is, gosh, why am I, why am I so tall? Why am I so tall? Why am I so loud? I guess I'm just loud. Like I'm just, I'm just that loud anyways. So I guess that makes a little sense. Oh man, that's just, all right. Okay, that's, that's very funny. That's very funny. I'm not going to lie. Also, this build is actually like genuinely kind of cool. I'm not going to lie to you. Whoo. Okay, all right. Okay, that's good. That's yep, I'm loud. Oh man, all right. Conrad suggested skeletal band created by Win Price. You can create a band using skeletons. They can play music for you. Subscribe to not if you're not your favorite president. I don't want to be president, but you should set for the subscribe. That's the second time we've done that. That's the second time we've done that. All right, we're going to see if this works. If they can actually genuinely make a band, this is actually, oh my gosh, look at these images. I don't want to play the video because I don't want to spoil it for myself. All right, we've gone back to a very old version of Minecraft for this. 1.12 super old. Why am I on an island? All right, we're going this way. Apparently to get this one started, this is also an island. Apparently to get this one started, you need a note block. So that's what I'm going to grab. And they said, if you stand on its shift and right click on it. Oh, snare one. That's actually kind of cool. I'm not going to lie. Snare two, snare three, snare four, snare five, snare six, snare seven. Oh, oh. Oh. Okay, that's actually kind of cool. You can get like different notes and stuff. Okay, skeleton band notes. Oh, so there's a ton of these. Okay, so wait. Oh my gosh, you can summon a musical skeleton. Look at you, look at you. Okay, if I give you a bass note, can I like, how do you, do you pick it up? Do you, what if I get multiple? (upbeat music) Ooh. (upbeat music) What is happening right now? How do I, how do I give you a different instrument? Whoa, open MIDI folder. Bro, you can like, whoa. Oh my gosh, there's so many. All star, upload and play selected. Okay, I'm gonna, oh, you can pause them. (upbeat music) You can pause them. start playing Despacito. Okay, you need to (upbeat music) Oh my gosh. How do I, how do I give you a different instrument? Okay, I'm confused and slightly concerned. You sir, do not do anything. You don't, did I do something wrong? I feel like I did something wrong here. I'm not sure, but this is really funny. I'm not gonna lie to you. (upbeat music) Okay, all right, okay, okay, I'm done. I don't know how that works, but it's very good. That was a very good, very good suggestion. I, oh man, that's so much. It's so much, there's so much. Banana water suggested cursed craft. Oh my gosh, they have longbread. This might be the ultimate mod to make me laugh here because gosh, I'm getting tired. Oh no, oh gosh, okay, all right, I have to, oh no. Oh my gosh, Ohio mod. I think that's what it used to be called. It used to be called cursed Ohio. Oh man, this is gonna be painful. I'm gonna struggle here. This is gonna be really funny. I'm gonna struggle with this one. I'm not gonna lie to you. All right, here we go. Oh, it didn't load. Oh, it did load. Oh, okay. All right, joining world loading terrain. Oh, oh, wow, that is not at all what I expected to see when I first logged into this. Oh my gosh, the leaves are decaying. Just a bunch of oak leaf. The green water is horrible. Oh my gosh. Hey guys, how's it going? Anything weird happening out here? How's it going? Bread, wow, oh boy. Okay, this is a biome. This is a, the sky is purple. Why is the sky purple? The world may never know. This is really concerning. I'm very concerned about what I might find in this biome. I don't know what it's gonna be, but whatever it is, it's gonna be terrifying. Wow, this is so green. It's so green. Why is it so green, man? Is this a different, this is the same biome. Why is there so much of this biome? Is there anything in this biome? This is terrible. This is terrible. Just the color scheme is so bad. I think, you know, that's intentional, but like it's still terrible, okay? It's terrible. All right, I guess we have to start looking at the, oh, there's the long bred the baguette. It's a baguette. Does it do anything to me? It doesn't do anything to me, but it's a long brad. Ooh, that almost got me. That almost got me. I don't know what that was from. I don't even know where that came from. Stic. Stic. I didn't laugh at that. Did I laugh at that? I don't think I laughed at that. Doesn't count. Doesn't count, don't talk about it. Metal bar. Can I, what happens when I... It's just a metal bar. It has durability. Why does it have durability? I just realized what the, that's a big one. That's a big pickaxe. Oh, it's just not. Yup, yup. Oh, oh. Oh, that is funny. Saul Goodblock. Sure is a good block. Sure is a good block. Okay, if I'm in survival mode, can I like... (upbeat music) Every breaking sound effect is gonna be that now, I think. This is a... (upbeat music) What did I just find? Ruby. Whoo! Okay, this is, this is really... This is really getting there. Fried egg? What is the fried, what? Fried egg. The rock block. Look at that. Whoa! Okay, okay, okay. Did that, that, oh my, all right, okay. Ah. What the heck is a good, what is that? Hold. (laughing) I can't. Ah, get outta here. (singing in foreign language) (laughing) You see what I mean? This, this, these mods, man. How could I not be so giggly all the time when that's what I hear, when this is what I deal with on a regular basis? (laughing) Oh, this is Steve, this is, oh my gosh. Oh my gosh, oh my gosh. I can laugh now, cow Steve, oh my gosh. Oh gosh, hello. I actually have that as a skin. All right, this is funny. We're just gonna leave that there. We're just gonna...
