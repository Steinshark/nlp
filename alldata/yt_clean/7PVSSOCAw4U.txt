Winter came quite quickly. By the warm stove, I feel like painting warm pictures. The sound of crackling wood brings certain childhood feelings of holiday and happiness. It's time for a snack and to get to work. Not my work, it's grandma's painting. Finally, the moles will bring me some benefit -- at the same time, I'll plant pots in the pitcher. It's very cold outside. I'll bring one bundle of firewood to add to the stove at night. I need to sweep and shake out the path to tidy up the room. Today I want to cook delicious Ukrainian dumplings. We need: minced meat, onion, flour, pepper, salt, and kefir. Carefully place the dumplings into boiling water and cook for about 10 minutes. Instead of sour cream, I add butter, it's tastier. I'll add firewood to keep the temperature in the house. It turned out delicious, I recommend this recipe to everyone! I want to decorate the house with beautiful patterns. I bought a special permanent marker with a nice stencil. I chose three colors: red, green, and black. A little bit of paint dripped, I'll use less from now on. After each painting, I need to wipe the permanent marker with a damp cloth. It's getting too hot, I'll take a break for some tea. Due to constant shelling of our energy infrastructure by Russian terrorists, there is currently no electricity. I'm always saved by products from ALLPOWERS (link to the product in the video description). This model allows me to be completely energy-independent during power outages. When it's sunny outside, I charge the battery with the solar panels included. The work with the permanent marker is finished for today, it turned out quite well, what do you think? I want to try drawing a viburnum to add some coziness to the house. The whole day flew by while working, I'll make dinner before it gets dark. Fried crucian carp in a pan is one of my favorite dishes. I'll also fry some potatoes with vegetables. This is incredibly tasty! I want to try making okroshka for the first time. It's a summer soup served cold, perfect for hot weather. Let's peel the necessary amount of potatoes. Cucumbers give the soup lightness and freshness. To make the soup heartier, we'll add boiled sausage. Since the eggs were previously disinfected, we can cook them along with the potatoes. When everything cools down, we can start chopping. Let's add some herbs -- parsley. A little salt and citric acid. Finally, add sour cream, ayran, and water. Let it sit in the fridge for at least 3 hours. During this time, we'll make a crayfish trap out of plastic bottles and try to catch something in the river. I've placed a dead frog as bait, and we'll leave the trap until evening. Today I planned to chop and cut all the branches I collected in the spring. I'll use them in winter to kindle the stove. It's very hot and tiring, so I take frequent breaks to rest. Finally, the last branch, now I'll carry everything to the wood storage. Time has passed quickly, and evening has come. I'll go check the crayfish trap. For the first time, it's not bad, we caught 5 crayfish. Boil the crayfish for about 10 minutes in boiling water. Very refreshing and tasty! Autumn is a tough time for every farmer. This year has been quite good for the harvest. It's time to harvest the pumpkins. I don't just cook dishes from them, but also earn income. I'll show you how later. First, I'll gather everything into one pile. I'm resting and then will continue working. Now I'll cut and remove the seeds from them. Large pumpkins are tough, and it's hard to cut them. The seeds need to be selected without any pulp. Everything I collected is spread on a baking sheet to dry in the sun. After drying, we pack them into bags for sale. I'll show you how to prepare the bags. I get 10-15 packs of seeds from one pumpkin. The result is good! You can plant pumpkins again, as they are not affected by the cold, which is great. You can work comfortably even in cold weather. I have many other useful plants in my garden. Today, I will be picking viburnum berries for jam. Viburnum jam has wonderful healing properties. I have a recipe that I passed down from my grandmothers. Now the jam needs to be cooked over low heat. Now I'll drain the water, make a puree, add the millet, and pour in some milk. I send this mixture back into the oven. In 30 minutes, my porridge is ready. I'll add a little sugar, and that's it! Enjoy! The mole is back on the property, causing trouble. At this wonderful time, everything is perfect -- except for the leaves. Let's bring fresh water into the house. It's already quite cool, so it's time to heat the stove. It feels like there's a smell of smoke in the house. I need to check the attic to see if there's a problem. Quite interesting, I've never been here before. I'm not very knowledgeable about this, but I don't see any smoke here, so I guess it was just my imagination. This is a TV antenna. Old photos of Grandma, these people have long since passed. Only the photos remain... I'll look through the album in the house, there's a lot of interesting stuff for me here. Once, we used to make treats from these molds, those were wonderful times... Grandma's treasure, unfortunately, she will never be able to spend it. Let's dive into the past for a moment, we need to remember those who are no longer here... So many Soviet coins. A small number of Russian Empire coins are also present. There is one gold coin. These two empires brought a lot of sorrow to my people, which the Russian Federation continues to do now. Let's make some nuts with condensed milk, like we did in childhood. Let's preheat this mold before we start. In about 10 minutes, the first batch is ready (put less dough, or it will be like mine). I'll open the condensed milk and fill the baked molds with it. Delicious, I highly recommend it, it's better than in the store. Thanks for watching!
