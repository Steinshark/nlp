I'd been to Sierra Leone. I'd been briefed about them. But I wasn't quite sure - [Narrator] General Guthrie and Defense Secretary Hoon convened a crisis meeting deep in the basement. - The problem was how were who'd been kidnapped, who of either being tortured, killed, or split up around Sierra Leone? So there was a real urgency about this. - They knew nothing. They had no intelligence. They had no eyes on the rebel base. They didn't know the rebel numbers. They didn't know what weaponry they had. And most worryingly of all, they didn't know whether would get killed in the rescue operation. - [Narrator] The British of a disastrous rescue mission in Africa seven years earlier.

So that was the good news. The bad news in this situation is the unpredictability So, in the blink of an eye, where you have stable, to them being killed. - [Narrator] To confirm that the hostages are being well treated, the negotiators insist on the patrol leader, in person. Kallay agrees. It's a decision he will come to regret. - Major Marshall, the of the British patrol, had been captured. He recognized in these meetings an opportunity to pass over in a clandestine fashion - The people who've been abducted here were professional military people. They foresaw where this was going. - What he had done is during the various walkabouts that the rebels had proudly &quot;There is our anti-aircraft weapons, &quot;and there are our mortars,&quot; during those walkabouts, Major Marshall had noted that he could see.

That was not a shrewd move on their part. - [Narrator] It's an unexpected but crucial breakthrough. At last, the British to begin planning a rescue mission, and there is only one group Britain's legendary special forces unit. [mortar bombs exploding] The SAS. They are the pioneers with a history stretching back as far as the Second World War. - The SAS, the British they're the special operations all of our special operations after. They set the model for - [Narrator] Through the years, they have constantly adapted and improved, playing a crucial role in from the streets of Northern Ireland to the polar wastes of to the deserts of Iraq, the SAS are famous for in any environment. - Behind your back, behind your back. - [Narrator] And to carry out the missions with absolute secrecy. - Go, go, go, go. - Small unit, just a few hundred people, the elite of the elite.

[mortar bomb exploding] One is storming difficult targets. In London, in 1980, they [people yelling] Breaking a terrorist siege [mortar bomb exploding] - The SAS pioneered the art of bursting onto a scene That means things like fast breaching doors, throwing to stun everyone inside, and taking all of the hostile parties out, leaving the civilians. That is what they perfected. - Go go go. - The training for releasing as you can imagine, because there's not a You know, you don't get second chances when you're dealing with people's lives. - They don't have all the special gear that the Americans have. What the SAS guys will tell you is, yes, what we lack in gear, we have [intense music] - [Narrator] That other great skill is jungle warfare. [intense music] [soldiers yelling] - Jungle warfare is, one of the purest forms of fighting. You've gotta really get atoned There's no open spaces. It's closed in. It's a tight environment. So it's on top of you. [gunshots blasting] [intense music] - [Narrator] Now the both of these specialties into practice and start planning an audacious rescue using the smuggled map. The crisis has been dragging but the negotiators continue to try and seek a peaceful settlement. [gentle intense music] Kallay is now asking for some medicine for his camp and a satellite telephone and announce his grievances to the world. The British quickly agreed, if they can have some of [gentle intense music] - There was a major, Five hostages were released in exchange for a satellite Now, that was a win-win situation, because one is worthwhile having effective and good communications, you know, with the hostile elements. Two, medicines are a good idea, particularly if they're gonna be used to treat any of your individuals. And three, it provides - [Narrator] It's a master stroke, which will change the Almost half of the men are now free. What's more, the British can use the signal to pinpoint Kallay's secret hideout. Unknown to him or anyone a task force has arrived in Sierra Leone to begin secret preparations for a rescue. It consists of about 300 men. Most are from Britain's the parachute regiment, known to all in the British But they are merely The rescue itself will be from the elite Special and about 20 colleagues from the British Royal Navy's the SBS, or Special Boat Service. To avoid arousing any suspicion, their mission is given Operation Barras. [intense music] - I'm often asked, &quot;How on &quot;these rather curious In contrast to the United States that talks about Operation Freedom, and has rather dramatic names for their military activities. And the answer is, I'm and probably very British, which is that we allow a computer that are then, providing allocated accordingly. [gentle intense music] - [Narrator] With the tacit support of the Sierra Leone government, the men of Operation Barras just outside the capital. - It wasn't until that we moved forward into Sierra Leone itself that Then you start thinking, Your kit's being packed as to what you wanna take in with you. You're beginning to get Briefing boards are going up. We need to be ready for it. [gentle intense music] - [Narrator] The SAS start gathering as much intelligence as they can about the rebels and their jungle hideout. Their preferred plan is to send a small team up river Moving in total darkness the rescue team can secretly sneak into the hostage hut, and quickly escape with the prisoners. - Move, move, move, move. - Hopefully without a shot being fired. As the troops wait for the green light, they begin rehearsing for the mission. - There was a floor plan so that you knew roughly what your limits of your and that sort of stuff. An arc being where you can At the height of battle, it could be quite and who's doing what. - This- no permission to mount the rescue. The final go can only come from Defense Secretary Jeff Hoon in London. The fate of the six hangs in the balance. If a bargain cannot be there will be an epic battle to freedom. [Black Zorro speaking Krio] - [Interpreter] The Brits were cocky. We would give them orders, &quot;No, we won't accept your command.&quot; They were extremely stubborn, actually. Sometimes we would talk to them, tell them what to do, They really did not make [Kallay yelling] Sometimes Kallay would have to make them understand. He would shake them up and hit them hard. He had to treat them roughly [Black Zorro speaking Krio] - The key thing would be You know, whether it was you know, in terms of their attitude, because the volatility is or whether they're gonna and thoughtful sort of way, or whether they're escalating to a point where it's clearly never you know, amicably. - [Narrator] Defense Secretary Jeff Hoon has still not authorized a but he has given the go and highly dangerous operation. A four-man SAS surveillance team stealthily enters the jungle. Their job is to provide about conditions in the rebel base - In the first place, they had to be inserted Actually, it meant that some in swamp, crawling unpleasant conditions I - [Narrator] Moving and and advancing just a few feet each hour, the men slowly approach rebel territory, looking for a concealed but not be seen. - That team was tasked with setting up an observation post, an OP. An OP, it's like a grave - They know how to quietly get whether it's marching and sitting in an for three weeks, staring at a target, so nobody knows they're there, that's what they do. - You dig a pit, you jump in the pit, you cover it with vegetation, and you lie there for as long as it takes to keep eyes on the base until either the mission is or the mission's called - [Narrator] This kind of surveillance is another SAS specialty, and it takes incredible The men must eat, sleep, for days on end, making only - Throughout the special operations world they have this expression, And these guys, when that's really what they are. - Straight away they discover [rhythmic music] Firstly, the captives are where they were first taken hostage. They have been moved across a even deeper into the jungle. Second, the original plan for the assault along the river will not work. It's full of concealed sandbanks, and the special forces On top of that, the jungle is so thick that an approach by The only option is a full - If we'd have sneaked taken everybody down then that would've been As it was, it couldn't pan out that way. We couldn't get to them, So, you know, we had to go in [rock music] - [Narrator] The only is one of the biggest in the world. [rock music] The twin rotor HC2 Chinook. But an air assault using has its own specific problems. - Well, the obvious is that they are very noisy and the element of surprise is lost if the enemy can hear a - [Narrator] Chinooks but they're also slow, hard Hence, their unofficial - If a Chinook gets hit with a large number of SAS people in it, it would be very serious. - [Narrator] To make matters worse, most of the West Side Boys group remained in their main base on They have a battery of heavy weapons, including rocket-propelled grenades, heavy machine guns, and mortars, any of which could easily or rain artillery fire down on the hostage camp across the river. Any rescue mission would quickly turn into a suicide mission. The SAS commanders must Time is running out. Rebel Leader Fodaly Kallay is getting more and more impatient with the endless rounds of negotiations. - It could change in the blink of an eye. It was highly unpredictable, and groups like this had already Even if they were compliant today, you could not, in any way, be assured of the safety of the hostages tomorrow or the day after. - [Narrator] The negotiators called Kallay daily on but with each conversation he He's spending his days taking By the start of every afternoon, Eventually, due to the lack Kallay's phone runs out - We have a message saying - [Narrator] The safety of the hostages is now at serious risk. - [Interpreter] One evening &quot;We are going to shoot one of them.&quot; - He took Major Marshall, to the edge of the jungle, made him kneel. They put an assault rifle to his head, and basically pulled the trigger. [gun clicking] - [Narrator] Kallay's rifle is empty, but next time, in all When news of this outrage Jeff Hoon decides that the time - We were certainly receiving about what was going on inside the huts where our men were being held prisoner. And I think one of the key is that they were being that weapons were being pointed at them, apparently being fired. And that kind of behavior as far as I was concerned. - [Narrator] Operation Barras is a go. - Well, the SAS, I think are probably the most They are trained in special operations. They're trained in rescuing They've done it in other places. - [Narrator] Everyone the odds are stacked heavily against them. In fact, the mission is so dangerous the men on the ground have - When they realized they that was when the men of the SAS, the men who were tasked to go coined the phrase, the Operation Certain Death. [intense music] - [Narrator] Assuming they even make it to their target without the rescue force will be and their enemy, who believe black magic makes will fight fearlessly and recklessly. - [Interpreter] In a battle who you killed. When I fire my weapon, I don't know who is dead or alive. All I know is when I pull the trigger, the bullets will be and no one will be left in front of me. [intense music] [rock music] - [Narrator] The men of Operation Barras are assembling before the a dangerous air assault on a The mission will be personally overseen by General Charles Guthrie, one-time commander of the SAS, now head of all Britain's Armed Forces. - We had a very good plan, Because in these things what the enemy are going to do. - [Narrator] Guthrie makes things plain to his political masters, the mission to rescue six British hostages is likely to incur heavy casualties. - General Guthrie made clear that this operation was not without risk, that he could not guarantee that we would not lose - In an attempt to overcome facing the rescue team, General Guthrie signs two simultaneous attacks. First, a team of about 50 elite SAS troops will approach the small Gberi Bana. This is where the captives are located, along with Rebel Commander Foday Kally. To surprise the rebels, they will fast rope down landing just feet from the hostage hut. - We didn't know what to expect, so all the time that we is the time that we have to act in, because if they take them somewhere else, it's jungle for jungle for jungle. [gentle intense music] - [Narrator] At the same time, the force of 150 paratroopers, who have been waiting in reserve, will launch the second attack. Landing by helicopter on they will strike the main to distract the large and disable their heavy weaponry. The mission is planned for the 15th day of the crisis. But at the very last The SAS observation team sends an urgent message. - The mission was originally planned for first light on a Saturday morning, but in fact, those who had been literally crawling through swamp in order to get near to the took longer than they had planned. - [Narrator] The plan to move within a few feet to provide covering fire, but they must move at night, to avoid being spotted. They ask for a 24-hour delay. - Because of the time it it actually was delayed [Black Zorro speaking Krio] - [Interpreter] The everybody was out of it. We had all been partying.

The plan's in your face now. It's stored up here. You know, you're just waitin' for that ramp to come - On operations you get psyched up. There's no question about that. And everybody wants it. I mean, you get a sort of working together, cooperation, which is quite difficult to explain, because it's extraordinarily but, you know, well trained - [Narrator] After a 10-minute flight, the six helicopters are on the final approach - The four-man observation team were in contact with the &quot;You can come in, you can come in. &quot;There's no one moving, &quot;It's light enough to see. &quot;It's light enough to see.&quot; And so the airborne assault force flew up to the rebel base using the river upon which to hide their progress as they came in.
