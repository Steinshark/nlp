Will the big bone it takes to go up Also, please consider the And if you're looking to buy [DING SOUND] KURT NIEBUHR: All how to beat a Good question. It's actually not launch control in this car. You put it in Sport Plus. And then you twist And you hold it for a bit and Track mode disables some system in this. And then it's just left foot on the gas. You see a little message show says Launch Control Active. Take your foot off the brake. [GUN COCKING SOUND] [GUNSHOT] And away you go. JONATHAN ELFALAN: So we've So we sort of know As far as launch control, If you're joining us I'm gonna walk through Really simple, You go There's three. You select Sprint. And that's it.

KURT NIEBUHR: Well, it [LAUGHS] It was all It was just hard to I might've gone in just, like, But I still got to wait. And, like, as soon as you're moving. And this thing still to get up to speed. But it was all right, JONATHAN ELFALAN: You know, hybrid power there, But like you said, And so once my wheels are I have 100% torque readily and I'm gone. KURT NIEBUHR: I gratifying to see how much But, yeah, like I I've gotta be so Because when the electric motor spools up, you kinda start So I just have to wait. I kinda want a shot So let's switch. [MUSIC PLAYING] JONATHAN ELFALAN: All I'm not changing any Track mode, gonna use It's gonna get off beautifully. And I'm gonna enjoy the Cause it sounds Wish me luck. KURT NIEBUHR: Now it's my turn.

Good job, NSX. I don't love the brake because it feels like But somehow, the and miraculously I'm stopping, KURT NIEBUHR: Yeah, it's you were actually I wasn't able to catch up. In the first race, you even though we were when we merged back together. I'm wondering if this But, yeah, the brakes, are not-- not that good anymore. But, you know, no excuses. You build a car you should at least put JONATHAN ELFALAN: 800 I mean, that's a lot of at the end of the quarter mile. So, yeah, I mean, it's definitely not But it is not that much slower. Like, it-- you know, I'm and then you just kinda of. Start walking away. But, Yeah, I don't know. Maybe. you know, EVs have their limits. They're not-- you know, affects them. KURT NIEBUHR: Like, I looked over we were just about And then you just So, I mean, I got as cleanly as you can get There was not a lot of And, yeah, just did my But it just wasn't enough. JONATHAN ELFALAN: Uh, we'll see. Maybe we should and-- and see if old Lucid of its hat. Because we're tied now. [MUSIC PLAYING] KURT NIEBUHR: Man, I hate doing I probably made a mistake. I did not make a mistake. In that last race, you saw the Winning the first race, the So we're gonna try it again. I'm hoping that the fact that stuff repeatedly-- it's it's built to be driven is probably what we're Because that's not a race car. It's not a sports car. It's not built to do this The NSX is. So hopefully that's means hopefully I will win. [DING SOUND] JONATHAN ELFALAN: I'm not sure what quite is getting a little hot. I can hear the fans running, you don't have to deal with But the batteries you run them hard like this. So-- so, yeah, we'll see. But this is the third race. It's for everything. So let's go. [MUSIC PLAYING] ; FEMALE RECORDING: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Oh, my God. Oh, HE got a good jump. Here I come. Here I come. Here I come with the power. KURT NIEBUHR: So fast. JONATHAN ELFALAN: And [TIRES SCREECHING] Holy shit. Oh, my God. [TIRES SCREECHING] Oh, just not enough tire. Oh my God, come on. Come on, Lucid. Oh. KURT NIEBUHR: Got him. I think the Lucid's overcooked. JONATHAN ELFALAN: KURT NIEBUHR: I can't It'd be nice to raise a JONATHAN ELFALAN: Yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] My brakes are gone. My brakes are-- oh, man. Well, that's what happens KURT NIEBUHR: Yeah. Are they smoked? JONATHAN ELFALAN: You got a Like, you were out in front. But, I mean, this just the slight power advantage, And, yeah, I mean, I was able And then I couldn't stop. Like, it broke right and I just did not to really make the corner. KURT NIEBUHR: Yeah. I think I got-- I think I got that launch timed, But I think that kinda-- the sprint by it right means that's starting to I mean, once it started clearly you just went But, yeah, think when pedal felt a little funky. And we give ample to cool off in All the cars get the same But, yeah, I think JONATHAN ELFALAN: I the difference between a that's made to repeatedly corners. Because you have carbon Am I not mistaken? And I have, I don't Yeah. I mean, the Sapphire [PERCUSSIONS PLAYING] NARRATOR: Here's if you wanna nerd out. All right, let's break it down. [MUSIC PLAYING] 0 to 60 goes to the Lucid In the quarter mile, with 10.86 at 129 miles an hour. Max cornering goes to And the win goes to with its best time of 33 For anyone interested in head on over to The NSX beat its It moves up to eighth. Place. And the Lucid didn't beat and it stays in ninth. JONATHAN ELFALAN: Well, KURT NIEBUHR: That was exciting. JONATHAN ELFALAN: I mean, but we didn't quite It seemed like it was KURT NIEBUHR: I think so. I think it kinda that the NSX has designed from the ground up to repeatedly. JONATHAN ELFALAN: Yeah. And the Lucid may be and that's kind of it. But that's not what And that's not why we love it. KURT NIEBUHR: No. I mean, it's still really fast. It's still, like can haul your family in this. Haul some ass, haul some family. JONATHAN ELFALAN: [LAUGHS] KURT NIEBUHR: You know?
