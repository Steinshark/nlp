- [Narrator] It is almost midnight at San Francisco International Airport as Air Canada Flight 759 is approaching. Just one more easy landing, and the pilots can call it a day. What they are not aware of is that the airport looks quite They are clear to land on runway 28 right, located next to 28 left. However, due to maintenance, the runway 28 left is closed that night and the lights had been turned off. But as the pilots who both have landed were expecting to see they make a mistake. Thinking that the center they confuse the taxi way on the right to be runway 28 right. On that very taxi way, four other flights are United One, a Boeing 787; Philippine Airlines 115, an Airbus 340; and two more United flights. In total over 1,000 passengers, is heading straight towards them all. The information about the runway closure was listed in a so-called NOTAM. These are notices to airmen which summarize any exceptional details regarding the flight. But these lists are quite and it's not easy to pick out the details that are actually relevant for the flight. The flight crew missed the runway closure. The pilots had been cleared for This means that they can line steering the aircraft Considering the clear weather conditions, the visual approach is But as landings on false runways or even taxiways have occurred before, careful pilots usually with instrument guidance. In this case, they could have used the ILS for short, of runway 28 right to confirm that they really In order to activate this system, a frequency corresponding to that runway has to be dialed into Modern flight management computers usually do this automatically, it had to be dialed in manually, and for some reason the The cockpit crew has had a long day. Coming from Toronto, Canada, their inner clock is already and overconfidence and fatigue have been attributed to these mistakes. Canadian pilot fatigue than US regulations, and the flight's captain had for the last 19 hours. As no one recognized that the airplane is lined up for the taxiway, Air Canada heads closer The ideal flight path at this airport comes in at a This was done in order stay further away from reducing noise pollution. Therefore, it is not unusual airplanes appear a little offset to the left of the runway center line. Air Canada further about to crash into the parked planes. And as they notice that they reassure themselves. - [Pilot] And Tower, just wanna confirm. It's Air Canada 759, we see some lights on the runway there. Please, confirm we are cleared to land? - [Narrator] At this moment, shows that it took the tower controller about five seconds to answer the call. - [Tower] Air Canada 759, confirm. Cleared the land runway 28 right. There is no one on 28 right but you. - [Narrator] There was only one controller managing the traffic at this time. Normally, an additional ground controller is responsible for handling but during the less busy night hours, the tower controller often The pilots of United Flight One, waiting as first in were listening in on this They probably were was still so far to the When it became obvious to them that the plane was they spoke up quickly, not even mentioning their own call sign in order to save any second. - [United Pilot] Where is this guy going? He's on the taxiway. - [Tower] Air Canada, go around. - [Pilot] In the go round, Air Canada 759. (suspenseful music) - [Narrator] What we just witnessed could have been the largest that ever happened. Air Canada 759 missed the tail only by a few meters. - [Tower] 759, looks for Charlie there. Fly heading 280, climb and maintain 3,000. - [Pilot] Heading 280, - [United Pilot] United 1, Air - [Tower] Yeah, I saw that, guys. (suspenseful music) - [Narrator] This real shows just how close the planes were. (suspenseful music) A full investigation was launched, and the National has released an entire many of which have Visual approaches at night at San Francisco when an Furthermore, two air traffic controllers are now required to be on duty until the late night arrival rush is over. The incident became a striking reminder of the dangers of but whether enough lessons is increasingly being put into question, as this year saw an unprecedented amount of close calls at US airports. - [Reporter] A close at New York's JFK Airport is now under federal investigation. - [Newscaster] In caught just in time. - [Reporter] This fourth happened at Burbank Airport on Wednesday. - [Newscaster] Well, tonight the FAA has launched an investigation into yet another near This one at Boston Logan - [Reporter] This morning, between two planes is under investigation. The FAA says a Republic Airways flight crossed the wrong runway - [Narrator] On January 13th, 2023, two airplanes almost at JFK Airport in New York City. American Airlines Flight 106 along Taxiway Bravo. To get to the departure where they were gonna take off, they were told to taxi along - [Ground Controller] Runway 4L, taxi left - [Pilot] Hold short - [Narrator] Note that the the runway assignment This is a minor deviation from protocol, and the controller simply dismissed it, something that will prove dangerous. At about the same time as they Delta Airlines flight on runway four left and - [Tower Controller] Delta 1943, runway four left, cleared for takeoff. - [Pilot] Cleared for takeoff, - [Narrator] Meanwhile, is continuing to taxi, and - [Ground Controller] American three one left at kilo. - [Pilot] Cross three one - [Narrator] But instead they taxi straight ahead onto Juliet, thereby crossing the very same runway on which the Delta flight is departing. Why the pilots of the continue taxiing straight JFK does often operate departures on runway three one left. Perhaps the pilots were that in their mind they were Another factor that might to believe they were was that the current winds and gusts of 24 knots. These conditions would have favored runway three one left for departure. For operational reasons, however, the airport was using runway Also noteworthy is that both flight crews could not hear each other. American 106 was on the ground frequency, while Delta 1943 was They were talking to different controllers and did not have a mental picture of what the other one was doing. Thankfully, just seconds the tower controller and reacts extremely well. - [Tower Controller] American hold position. - [Man] Shit! - [Tower Controller] American - [Tower Controller] Delta Delta 1943, cancel takeoff clearance. - [Pilot] Rejecting. All right, ah, whoof, Delta 1943. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] The delta about 1000 feet shy of and nobody was injured. The US Federal Aviation Administration categorizes runway incursions Besides the incursions that there are four categories in which a collision was to errors that at no point The JFK incident was serious enough to be categorized as Category B. Looking at the statistics, that the number of serious incidents over the past two decades While there were 22 category there have never been more than in the past decade. As far as category B a similar trend is visible. - If you look at the last decade or so, you would see between 10 and that this would happen. This year we're on track and even one is one that I - [Narrator] The JFK incident has put a large media but still it will just take three weeks until the next close call, this one perhaps the most scary one. Flight FedEx 1432, a was coming from Memphis and arrived in the early As happens so often in with a thin layer of fog, just about a thousand feet They are still high above that fog layer enjoying a clear sky, but they will have to dive - [Pilot] Austin Tower, FedEx 1432, heavy passing 5.4 for that Cat - [Narrator] Due to the low visibility, FedEx 1432 had to execute what is called a category three instrument approach, a procedure applied at very low visibility and clouds reaching almost to the ground. For such approaches, the auto is used, and the flight crew only monitors the correct operations of all systems. This in itself is just and nothing unusual. - [Tower Controller] FedEx one eight left, RVR touchdown 1,400. Midpoint 600, rollout 1,800. One eight left clear to land. - [Narrator] The RVR value denotes the visibility in feet at three different near the touchdown point, The phrase passing 5.4 means from the ILS transmitter, which sits at the end of the runway. At just this moment, - [Southwest Pilot] Tower Southwest 708. We're short of one eight - [Tower Controller] Runway one eight left, 1200. Midpoint 600, rollout 1600. Fly heading 170, runway Traffic three miles final is a heavy 767. - [Southwest Pilot] Okay, fly heading 170, cleared for takeoff, one eight left. Copy the traffic, Southwest 708. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] The tower is to have the Southwest flight take off on the same runway before the FedEx lands. Three miles is usually to let a departure slip in front, and the phrase traffic on is to inform the Southwest crew about the incoming FedEx plane which requires them to but things take longer than expected. Time is ticking as the FedEx not able to see anything out of their cockpit windows anymore. Their distance to the to merely 1.2 miles, and about the Southwest still - [FedEx Pilot] Tower cleared to land on one eight left. - [Tower Controller] FedEx 1432 heavy, that is affirmative, You are cleared to land. Traffic departing prior - [FedEx Pilot] Roger. - [Narrator] 60 seconds have now passed since the tower gave Southwest and apparently they are still Although there is no fixed time limit for starting the takeoff roll, it is expected that in an expeditious way. - [Tower Controller] Southwest - [Southwest Pilot] Rolling now. - [Narrator] Meanwhile, through the fog layer to look for the approach At about 150 feet above the and they can make out the still on the runway They immediately initiate a go around, and they address the - [FedEx Pilot] Southwest, abort. FedEx is on the go. - [Tower Controller] Southwest 708, roger, you can turn right when able. - [Narrator] The tower's transmission is the result of a misunderstanding as he assumed the abort which was informing them about - [Southwest Pilot] Negative. - The Southwest crew, however, was probably already and rejecting the takeoff As they were busy, they This exchange shows just very quickly. Both planes come within but the FedEx is able to out climb the departing Southwest plane. Normally, one aircraft is not allowed to give instructions to another. The fact that the FedEx crew did shows the severity of the situation. After the tower controller he takes active control again and gives instructions to both airplanes that keep them separated. - [Tower Controller] FedEx When able, turn left - [FedEx Pilot] With FedEx 1432 heavy. - [Tower Controller] Southwest 708, you can turn left heading one seven zero. - [Southwest Pilot] One seven zero. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] Two airplanes in such a situation. At the same time, the that several procedures did Whether by directly seeing or a warning of the Tikka system the FedEx crew took timely from the other aircraft. - [Tower Controller] FedEx You have our apologies. We appreciate your professionalism. - [FedEx Pilot] Thank you. - [Narrator] Was it a wise go in front of FedEx while they In hindsight, the answer is probably no, particularly not at a where a short two minute would've taken all the stress On the other hand, Southwest pilots are known for their proficiency Thousands of other times has already worked just fine. When it comes to the ultimate the full NTSB investigation Since the beginning of the year, eight cases of one way three of which have already At what point it is no longer a statistically plausible accumulation but a serious problem is difficult to say. At least to some degree, is highlighting something All of this is to prevent If you look at a list of the that ever happened, the number one spot isn't a high altitude crash but rather two planes This accident occurred in 1977 between a KLM and a Pan-American flight. Both planes were 747s, at the time the largest passenger plane in the world. In the cockpit of the KLM sits one of the airline's who even appears in the The weather had deteriorated massively, and the two planes did not see each other nor could the tower While the PanAm is the KLM is lining up for their departure and with the pilot under that the runway is clear, (dramatic music) How it came this far which is why I have produced about this crash, creating detailed models and mapping out where - [KLM Pilot] The KLM 4805 And we're waiting for our ATC clearance. - [Narrator] This video is part of my ongoing &quot;Under Exposure&quot; in which I explore topics that could not work on YouTube.
