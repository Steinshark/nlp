&gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: What was it like to day out in the White House down at Mar What was that like? General HR McMaster on [MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Welcome to a retired Lieutenant General a fellow at the Hoover Institution. HR McMaster served from 2017 advisor to President Donald Trump. General McMaster graduated earned a doctorate from the University of important roles in the Gulf War, the war During the Gulf War, the tank unit he decisive tank battle since The outcome, 28 Iraqi tanks destroyed, American casualties zero. A warrior, but also a historian. In 1997, General McMaster published Robert McNamara, the Joint Chiefs of A book that remains essential reading In 2020, General McMaster published Battlegrounds Which brings us to General McMaster's At War with Ourselves: My Tour of Duty &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Peter, I'm a huge fan of Uncommon Knowledge. Thanks for having me. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: You and &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: [LAUGH] time At War with Ourselves, A few months after I departed the White This is taking place in 2018. I miss you, General, the president said. Thank you, Mr. President, I replied, if I We both knew, however, Why not? &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Well, Peter, you just get kind of used up And I felt actually to And I tell this many anecdotes that I often had to tell President Trump I had to sort of try to guard And in doing so, I think that over time, And also our relationship was poisoned my role in trying to give There were those around me, and who would prefer to try to manipulate not Donald Trump's agenda, And so we got kind of used And so we parted ways actually, &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: But you were done? &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: But &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: All right, the job. Let's just take a moment. National Security Adviser, serves as national security and foreign policy and The position of National Security Adviser administration. So we're talking about a role in And the National Security Council administration. Okay, all of that you'll What does it mean in an age of What should Americans know about the job the National Security Council &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Well, it's important because the National Security Council was of Pearl harbor, the intelligence And the lessons of World War II, national power in an effort to mobilize vitally important war for all humanity. And so the National Security Council the need for coordination and integration the president with the best analysis, And, I think, the elected president can determine his or And then the National Security Council, who are mostly members of are critical in the sensible &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: So could I, which I put you, I knew a man who's now been dead for was a young man in the Truman White House. And he explained, in those days there's And it was his job. Reports would come in from State it was his job. He'd have paper all over his desk. And it was his job to decide what needed And before the National Security Council, the president really couldn't be quite what was happening over at the Pentagon. So the National Security Council the aim of the National Security Council to bring into the White House information &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: That's correct. So it started almost as an executive invigorated after Truman under General a fantastic officer who should, But really, Truman, he was very skeptical about the National Truman was until the Korean war, and And then he held numerous national and saw the value of that organization &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: So again, which I think tracks with what I'm asking you to sharpen it up for me. So it begins with, let's bring this And then Dwight David Eisenhower And one of the things I was always struck the Reagan White House, And in the Reagan White House, the senior then they'd go back to their and And the guys in the Eisenhower White House o'clock senior staff meeting So Eisenhower uses this information which is a slightly different thing. First, you keep the president It's a tool of coordination, and then under Eisenhower becomes And the reason I'm being a little this sets up some of the strains State would like to run foreign policy. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: [LAUGH] Yes. to run defense. And there's HR over there in the old we don't quite know what the heck he other information goes in there and orders Roughly. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: [LAUGH] Well, there's an institutional tension. There's tension there. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Okay. the position of the national security is the only person who has the president of national security and The other cabinet officials, departments, maybe agendas within their bureaucratic inertia associated with- &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Pre existing policies. So there is a natural tension there I the story of the book. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: I wanna spend another &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Right? &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: It's a staff job. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Yeah. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: You were a commander. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Right? don't typically like staff jobs. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Yeah. this one? &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Well, as Epictetus said, play well, the role assigned you, My role was not to run foreign policy my not to centralize decision making I the president. Nobody elected me, actually, nobody state either. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Okay? as helping the president determine his agenda and then assisting with the &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Okay, that piece of context involves three stars, United States army, retired, first national security advisor, &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Yeah. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: He's resigned over may not have given to &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: He was railroaded. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Exactly I I think it's very clear now that &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Yeah. the fact is, you replaced a man. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Yeah. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Who had walking into that job, intend to do? &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: What I wanted to do is the president and as you know from it can be a very turbulent period in Now you have the added level of a national security advisor. So what I wanted to do is to make sure to determine his foreign policy and national security agenda there's And as I mentioned in the book, in many cases, destructive foreign policies A lot of work to do no time for drama but what I was trying to do make sure everybody understood the mission That's everybody on the national also I wanted to get around and all the principals on the National and forge a very effective working analysis, best advice, &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Okay so, again, is all fascinating to me because and yet &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Yeah. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Okay so there's far you almost sound as you just bring him on a silver And he says, I'll have options I'll have sir, and you take it but &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: No, &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: And because the principal advisor. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Yes. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: So you're permitted, your own to advise him correctly on okay, Donald Trump's instincts were which by the time he got to it, had cost hundreds of billions of dollars, &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Right? &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: How &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Well, you listen to the president right nobody elected you have to listen And then what I would tell the president with your frustrations wanted to do But to do that, I think you have to decision making by having a common the challenge that we're facing, President Trump wanted to know, Why do the American So what we did is we put into place what session to apply design, thinking and first order national security challenges, And we put them all in the form of the principles around a five page paper And I would bring that framing to him let's come to a common understanding &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: So Ajar well what that in your book, you had a particular the president, even when you get &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: By the way, this is and it is very clear that you got it is respectful of the president, even And it is overall, it's the tone of his experience, to offer it to the tone the overall tone of the book is, Let me tell you about it as calmly and because there's another generation Okay so granted all that, Now I don't mean to sound as though don't know how to get an office He knew how to do that. I don't know how to run casinos in But he didn't know why we were in so your first job is to provide a kind &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Well, actually, he knew a lot he's not an incurious and he's given to certain impulses, I'll tell you, that was very positive in a lot of what had become sort of a routine challenges we faced. So, for example, should underwrite our own demise with while China is weaponizing its status, So he, because of him questioning right that China having been welcomed as China prospects prospered, liberalize its form of governance &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: So Donald Trump part of HR is thinking, yeah, because there's a lot of &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Absolutely and to help him understand better how to put something in its place right so It's about putting into place policies and interests, that will strengthen our extend our influence in the world that's &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Okay, we'll return let's get to so the subject. The title of the book is And you refer a number of times to the White House, instead of helping each interference, okay. So you've got two themes here. One, of course, is the person, temperament of Donald Trump himself, He's running for president again. Of course, we'll come back to that. But the other theme here is the leaking to the press, the dealings cabinet. Let's start with the staff. Reince Priebus, the chief of staff Steve Bannon, now serving four months for Steve Bannon, who held the title counselor until leaving the White House Quote, Bannon, Priebus, and others employed the same principal Iago is the villain, and he is a very darkly drawn villain Explain. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Well, what they would is poison his ear. Poison the president's ear with innuendo, with all kinds of false reports because what they wanted to do is solidify And the best way to do that would be his sense of beleaguerment associated with And so they wanted to create this and they convinced the president, hey, we're the two reliable people &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: We're your only guys. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: We're your only guys. And so when I was advocating for not trying to manipulate him into maybe Steve Bannon's agenda, And what they decided to do at one point, was to try to essentially kneecap me and &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Okay, so because how did they The President of the United States Why did he put them there? I can't read Donald Trump's mind, but at least in part because they represented &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Sure. to the alt right, and I think that's &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: I'm not super &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Yeah, right. You've got to get it. But they had a certain kind of They were there because the chief And you say to yourself, I got to How do you draw the lines at which- the line that I draw- I'm saying? &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: I can take I can take any kind of leak. I mean, it doesn't matter to me. That's noise to me. When they begin to affect policy, when when they begin to affect, really, the that's when I became concerned about it. And I'll tell you, Peters, [LAUGH] There are many instances where I with them. At one point, I invited Steve Bannon to I'm really busy. I'm like, okay, well, I don't know what your portfolio is, Matt. [LAUGH] I guess he was But I tried. But what they would rather do, I think, power games. And I just didn't play those games. I just tried to focus on my When they began to impinge on decisions, when they began to try to manipulate the decisions that might cut against our concerned about their tactics and &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: All right, This is serious. These are people who hold at war with ourselves. Secretary of Defense James Mattis and seems to have concluded that and that anyone at betting That means you because you While Bannon had viewed my efforts to the president from the alt right agenda, my efforts as enabling a president Explain that. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: So I think, essentially- let's just stipulate &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: This is tricky for In part, I've never met Rick Tillerson. You know both of these men. But Jim Mattis is a colleague of And I think it's fair to say that disagreements, you view I certainly view Jim &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: But you had &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: I have respect &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Okay. I think people are motivated in three the White House. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: And &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: What you're in &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: In other words, &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: I wonder experience in the White House. So group a are people who are there to own agenda, right. And they're there to give best analysis, to develop multiple options for because he's the one who got elected then. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: And &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: I think I'm in Group A. And I think, interested in giving not interested in giving him a wide range is they want to manipulate decisions That's where they came They viewed Donald Trump as a cipher, Somebody who they could use for The third group of people are those who wanted to, again, limit the information because they saw it as their job to from Donald Trump. And so based on what, your motivation, and created natural tension between me and And so that's how I've sort I think these groups exist But I think, it's just amplified to maybe a hot, frustration in you and Jim. For military men, we're one of the We may fight things out, but &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Sure. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: And in a White House as many factions as it's the strangest thing, because who, command than on the staff But in fact, it doesn't exist. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Yeah, And then also, you have other tasks- you're temperamentally unprepared for &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Well, I've worked in some complex environments, working with foreign partners and I've had to command multi, I've had multinational civil military task forces So I was used to that. I was used to trying to lead and coordinate really, And I'll tell you, despite all this associated with the question you asked just what is your understanding of What is the natural tension between that Then you have the added the degree to which Donald Trump creates [LAUGH] And there are those who it's a very complicated situation. But I think the story generally is really to do the best job I could for And I do think that we succeeded, in effecting some fundamental and So anyway, my attitude was, [LAUGH] hey, bring it on, And Bannon, he used to love to use a war everything, but I was not really concerned okay, just bring it on, &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Let tank &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Well, &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: I want to then we'll come to Afghanistan, what I'd like to do is talk until But you mentioned that early on, you went across the street in Washington who had served as national security had held a number of positions, forth, during the Reagan administration. And Brent Scowcroft said, And here's a quotation from at war Reagan's White House while James A Baker as a witches' brew of intrigue, As it happens I was there, right? &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: I think you must [LAUGH] I can't believe &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: I can confirm &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Yeah. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Let me give you because I think this, &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: And remember Poindexter, &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Yeah, &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Second term- &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: But the title at war we were at war with ourselves he was referring to the earlier period. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Okay, So essentially in an alliance, you've got Ed you've got Bill Clark as national security that doesn't have that much confidence And you get this first term, because of this jostling, &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Right. which lays out. Which lays out, I took over and you read. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Refer to here which is a research program, &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: That looks &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: It looks that worked was the president didn't trust that very close hold, so he had Bill &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Right. are dead, so you're just gonna But Bill Clark had bud when Bud McFarlane recognized it wasn't inserted in a speech from the Oval Office, And the president went ahead with it state and secretary of defense a couple of they were informed. So this loose jointedness, the evil empire address of 1983, which I wrote of 1987, Reagan's senior but because there was enough you could get things to the president Why? Because the man at the center he knew what he was doing. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: All right. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: So The chaos in your White House because the president himself &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: I would say, &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: You're not gonna go for &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: No, No, what I would say is, the president he was dead right about them. And so what I was trying to do was I used the title, one of the chapters is I saw that as my role. And I think- it would literally end up with a piece of and you talk these through with him, &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Yes, sometimes in a small group format in the a formal NSC meeting, where he made policies from 180 degree switch 180 degree switch to our How about toward Iran and the Iran an overdue corrective to the unwise So we put all of these in place The South Asia strategy which involved the war in Afghanistan, that was conducive to the kind of over decisions that involve life and And he heard from all of his cabinet, &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: We need to dwell because that actually is almost a case &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Absolutely. people who know a lot about their fields, you fight it out in front &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Sure. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: And he makes the got it correct? &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: And you know what? &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: It worked that way, &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: No, and I don't want chaos in the title, And of course, it was chaotic, and And you're mentioning all the kind of the But I think we succeeded I can't really talk to definitively in transcending that chaos and And in that first three weeks on the job, I talked to every living former &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: And I tried to understand my role and I think what was difficult is at times, understand my role and I wish I'd spent more time with him this is my role relative, &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: And let's be explicit Rex Tillerson. What did the secretary of defense and what &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: What they wanted me to I think. And so to give him options they want to control. And there was a fundamental tension, between those goals of collaboration and &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Okay, now to the man of Donald Trump emerges from everything I saw in Trump traits similar And later you write of a visit to contrasting Trump with Reagan, the differences between the two presidents including tax cuts, deregulation, Whereas Stark has the contrast Trump's lavish Mar a Lago. Donald Trump and LBJ, Donald Trump and Explain this. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: [LAUGH] So, Lyndon especially the way he came into office. And I, I think. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: After an assassination. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: After assassination especially in the 64 period, And I'll tell you, I mean, so much of [LAUGH] whatever ability I had And my ability to be kinda stoic in the was encountering, So I really was grateful for the gift which was to study history and to read- Dwight Eisenhower, &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: [LAUGH] a lot, right? &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Absolutely. But Johnson was insecure for a number of preoccupied with trying to get And then he also had a sense of much like President Trump. President Trump, I think, I'm not [LAUGH] a psychologist, but he collusion claims and And so, these insecurities and this kinda manipulate both presidents, right? Johnson was very distrustful of So if somebody wants to kneecap me or say that they're not supporting the they called him a name or, All of those in connection with me, a vulnerability there, So I think that was kind of a similarity And then with Reagan, I really talk communicators in the relatively new social media for Trump. And while Trump, I would say, was not maybe as elegant in his form he didn't- got the points across. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: He got if you look at his speeches, &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Yes, &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: They're But there are big differences between And I think Reagan had the self I talk about how important And Trump has a sense of humor, everything else, you have to not really a self And I think where Reagan was sort of, he really understood kind It's more maybe about Trump, &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Right. I try to compare and contrast those presidents as a way to get and what are the traits we ought to &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: If I may say so, that the man is running for &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: And the serious reader who wants which you can judge this man, &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: I hope it's that. [CROSSTALK] This is not this is not [INAUDIBLE] by Joe Biden or &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Right, absolutely. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Okay, absolutely, so readers my perspective on, I think, what for readers to understand better What the heck is What is the role of What does an effective national security What are some of the frictions you relationships and roles and how do you overcome those or And then, of course, to get at this &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Okay, can I, just another moment or two here and But there's a fascinating Stephen Miller, are working on a speech that the president And you become reflective in this passage, I had labored to reconcile Some of these were confounding. And then you go on to list contradictions in Trump's views. Let me just read a couple. Trump believed that the United States but he often manifested moral equivalence. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: So, Trump does believe but he then has this moral equivalence to some of the abuses of power. And, I would say, criminal activity And I used a quote from him in 2016, and that sort of thing. So I think that whereas Reagan kind of portrayal of America And whereas Trump at times engages confuses maybe international audiences And you have also this narrative the maladies in our society, and with an optimistic view of the future, &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: He was viscerally, he was viscerally opposed to communist and was ambivalent at best about &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Right, right. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: He hated those systems, &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Absolutely, yeah. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: And that comes from Queens, that comes from And the strong men who he admires that, &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: I think in some ways he as strong leaders. And I quote, actually, President Trump on about, [LAUGH] he said, sometimes I have But our adversaries, if they're tough Somebody will have to explain that [LAUGH] he takes office, &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Right. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: He takes office and Russia, as he describes it, begins as a dirty trick in &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: These are the findings &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Correct. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: We now know that he was right that it was fake news. He was right that he was being &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Absolutely. the Federal Bureau of Investigation the FISA Court, taking place all around him, That Robert Mueller, the investigation dominates the news, and then it presents There was no Russian collusion whatsoever. So here's the question, suppose the Clinton campaign Suppose that Donald Trump's election that even people who disagreed the constitution, took the historical That side gets the chance four years at a time, we win back. This is a game, we all learn to live Suppose the Democrats, journalists had Just given the guy a fair &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: I think the environment I think he would have been ability to discharge his duties. He wouldn't have had maybe that The press would never like him or &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: I mean, honestly, you realize you can't trust the FBI, the man who comes through the door is wait a minute, How do I know I can trust him? In other words, it poisons everything. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Actually, Peter, that was my only assignment in was his national security advisor. [LAUGH] I had never- &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: I got it. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: No, I had never So I had never, never lived in [LAUGH] Okay. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: So I think there was the Department of Justice or FBI, but that carried over to the entire And I think that this really- they did, because the intel community, if issue, you get hearings, you get to Intel, the actual budget It relies entirely on trust among And they violated that trust again and Am I wrong about that? &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Well, I don't think in kind of egregious misconduct as But for- &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: But I was just talking there was a great deal Enough distrust to go around. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Enough to go around. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: To go around, yeah. And so I think his whole mentality This is one of the things I'm concerned the outcome of this election is, is that, I think the president encouraging that I criticize him for that. But we have to also remember, there were election deniers in 2016, 2017. Remember the not my president movement, this guy is not a legitimate president So I think what we have to stop compromising our confidence in processes to score Both parties are guilty of that, &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: HR, Last questions here are about questions about you, but I'd like to begin Here's columnist Mark Thiessen in turned off our tvs and stopped looking This is before COVID hits, with the sound conservative presidents in modern Here's former vice president Dick Cheney. In our nation's 246-year history, who posed a greater threat to Here's another pair, Roger knows politics, Reagan, quote, the only- against me very aggressively. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: He would have been- Alex Jones, yeah, right. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Okay. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: [LAUGH] a friend a lunatic, but Roger would be &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: [LAUGH] consultant Roger Stone. The only thing Trump is guilty of is Abraham Lincoln, close quote. That's preposterous. Sorry, that's my view. We'll see what the Economist the biggest danger to the world in 2024, Why does this man have &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Well, &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Both sides of this are preposterous, aren't they? &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: No, I mean, I think hopefully what my book does because I do say it's the good, And I do try to place Trump's four years, his four year presidency in context of the four, going on four Biden years that- democracy? Is he the greatest danger &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: No, I think what happens is Donald Trump He's offensive to people. And what he does is he actually elicits destructive than anything he says or And so what Im really concerned these centripetal forces that we unleash his most loyal followers and And I wish that Donald Trump could I wish he could, instead of doubling that he could extend that base more and &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Did you ever &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: I talked to him in And especially I've got stories in here the Paris accord and so forth. And what I would try to say is, can bring more people with you, and then and we can make more rapid progress &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Summing up here, how did HR McMaster do? First, Donald Trump at war with ourselves. Despite the chaos in the White House, Trump administered long-overdue Results included a fundamental new policies toward China, Youve talked about Iran here already. Venezuela, Cuba. That's pretty impressive. &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Impressivre, yeah. All within one year. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: All within one year. And yet you go on to accuse taking one thing with another. Did Donald Trump do his job, do the job of the president of Did he protect the republic? &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: I think I mean, I dont think he set out in But whereas he could make oftentimes he would make decisions Once he heard different views and learned found it difficult to keep that decision, Especially when faced with his most stalwart supporters, who I think somebody who they could say, you're abandoning your So I think that was the real effect presidential command, was his difficulty in hanging In the book, what I do is I give him, due credit for making really tough going back on some of those decisions, consequences to cut against &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: All right, Herbert Raymond McMaster, 1995 appearance on Firing Line &gt;&gt; Bill Buckley: We talked, in 1964, estimated we needed 500,000 &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Yes. you think that he was obliged the American people? &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Well, the Joint Chiefs were, to give their the secretary of defense, and They failed to do that because what this period is they compromise &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: So, HR, there you are Dereliction of Duty. Principle and expediency, with civilian authorities, So, skilled professionals, the man who succeeded you as national all came, they may want to, They can correct me anytime they want to, I hereby extend an invitation to But, it seems to me fair to say that better than Trump. They knew policy better than Trump, the country in foreign And they all decided it was their duty, to protect the rest of us from Trump's And HR McMaster made a different decision, &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: No regrets at all, Peter, did you see that clip? [LAUGH] Gosh, it was funny, I mean, I went this is really a surreal circumstance the National Security Advisor in now being responsible for the national criticized from the perspective So, I wrote down five things that I would mistakes, right? And the first is, we would take more the challenges we're facing and The second thing that we would do objectives, right? There were no clear goals and objectives Before we ever talked about I made sure that these were his goals and The third thing that we would do, is we that he actually had a say in his own- put him in a box? &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Never The fourth thing is I would never hold was telling him what he didn't want to Advisors, [LAUGH] during the period in they concluded that I have to tell Lyndon it will diminish my influence with him. Well, what the hell good And then the final lesson was security decision-making from Now, there are gonna be people who of political ramifications of decisions, they're gonna have a natural But, in the development of those options, I didn't want them infected by how is this And I think we succeeded, I didn't make those five mistakes. &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: You &gt;&gt; H.R. McMaster: Those five mistakes? &gt;&gt; Peter Robinson: Okay, so back to you with what I promise Here he is running for president again, a lot can happen between now and He may win, this is not a crazy idea.
