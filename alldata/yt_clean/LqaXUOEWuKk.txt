OH, COME ON, PEOPLE. MR. WALKER? &gt;&gt; AW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] &gt;&gt; LOOK -- OBVIOUSLY, IT MADE A SOUND. &gt;&gt; YEAH? HOW DO YOU KNOW? &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HOW DO I KNOW?

[ LAUGHTER ] ...DID IT MAKE A SOUND? &gt;&gt; [ Laughing ] HE SAID, &quot;WHEN I FART.&quot; &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU WERE THERE TO HEAR IT, AND YOU WERE THERE TO SMELL IT, SO... [ LAUGHTER ] &gt;&gt; IN THE BACK THERE? &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IT DEPENDS ON THE MEANING OF THE WORD &quot;SOUND.&quot; IS IT MENTAL OR PHYSICAL? IF WE DEFINE IT AS PURELY PHYSICAL, THEN IT MEANS A PATTERN OF VIBRATIONS IN THE AIR. BUT SOUND CAN ALSO BE MENTAL. IN THAT CASE, IT WOULD BE DEFINED AS VIBRATIONS, BUT HOW OUR MIND INTERPRETS THE THINGS WE HEAR. SO, IF YOU THINK THAT SOUND IS PHYSICAL, THEN, YES, IT MADE A SOUND. BUT IF, TO YOU, SOUND IS MENTAL, THEN IT DIDN'T. &gt;&gt; VERY GOOD, MISS SCOTT. YOU SEE? NOT SO OBVIOUS, IS IT? &gt;&gt; EITHER WAY, SHE WOULDN'T HEAR IT. [ LAUGHTER ] &gt;&gt; OH, HOLD ON.

I'LL COVER YOUR SHIFT. &gt;&gt; [ CHUCKLES ] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET HER GET AWAY! &gt;&gt; THEY SAID IT WOULD PERMANENTLY DAMAGE YOUR EARS. &gt;&gt; MY EARS ARE RUINED. HOW DARE YOU MAKE THAT DECISION WITHOUT TELLING ME? IT'S NOT YOUR DECISION TO MAKE. IT'S MINE. IT'S MY LIFE, MOM. AND I WANT TO HEAR. ALL YOU EVER WANTED TO DO WAS CONTROL ME. THAT'S WHY YOU NEVER LEARNED SIGN LANGUAGE. THAT'S WHY I NEEDED THIS STUPID INTERPRETER. AND THAT'S WHY YOU NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT THIS SURGERY. YOU DON'T WANT ME TO HEAR AGAIN. YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOUR CONTROL. &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU JUST LOST IT. I DON'T NEED AN INTERPRETER ANYMORE. AND I DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU NEED ME MORE THAN EVER.

DESPITE ALL YOU DID TO STOP IT, I'M IN LOVE AND I'M GOING TO HEAR AGAIN AND I'M GOING TO PLAY MUSIC JUST LIKE DAD. AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO STOP ME ANYMORE! &gt;&gt; WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU GOING? &gt;&gt; TO CORRECT A MISTAKE I MADE A LONG TIME AGO. YOU KNOW, SHE'S 21 YEARS OLD. LOOSEN THE REINS A LITTLE. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] &gt;&gt; GET IN THAT CAR, AND YOU'RE FIRED. &gt;&gt; I QUIT. &gt;&gt; MARIANNE, GET BACK HERE. THAT'S MY DAUGHTER. SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO DRIVE. &gt;&gt; WANT A BEER? YOU BUY A PAPER EVERY DAY, DON'T YOU? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND YOU THROW IT OUT EVERY NIGHT? &gt;&gt; [ CHUCKLES ] YEP. &gt;&gt; EVER READ IT? &gt;&gt; NOPE. &gt;&gt; THEN WHY DO YOU BUY IT? &gt;&gt; I LIKE THE GUY WHO SELLS THEM. &gt;&gt; [ CHUCKLES ] YOU LIKE THE GUY WHO SELLS THEM. &gt;&gt; YEAH -- GEORGE. &gt;&gt; HMM? &gt;&gt; [ SIGHS ] HE COULD BE OUT THERE BEGGING FOR CHANGE, BUT HE'S NOT. HE'S SELLING PAPERS. AND NO ONE SUPPORTS HIM. I MEAN, NO ONE WANTS TO BUY A PAPER FROM A GUY THAT LOOKS THE WAY HE DOES. THEY'D RATHER GET IT FROM A STORE OR A NEWSSTAND OR ONE OF THOSE DISPENSERS OR SOMETHING. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S THE SAME PAPER. &gt;&gt; SAME PAPER, HUH?

[ DOOR CLOSES ] [ TOILET FLUSHES ] &gt;&gt; HEY, THE MARKET'S DOWN 300 POINTS, JUST LIKE MY TURD IN THE CRAPPER. [ GASPS ] &gt;&gt; [ WHIMPERING ] &gt;&gt; VERY OFTEN, THERE ARE NO SYMPTOMS. ALL OF A SUDDEN, THERE'S A SEIZURE, AND THEN... &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S -- THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME TREATMENT, SOMETHING. [ HEART MONITOR BEEPING ] &gt;&gt; YOU CAME. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU UP AGAIN. [ DOOR CLOSES ] &gt;&gt; DANNY, I'M DR. FRAZIER. YOUR SEIZURE WAS DUE TO THE SPREADING OF AN ADVANCED STAGE OF GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME, A PRIMARY BRAIN TUMOR. THIS TYPE OF CANCER IS VERY DIFFICULT TO TREAT, ESPECIALLY WHEN DEEPLY ROOTED. NOW, CHEMO AND RADIATION TREATMENTS CAN IMPROVE HEALTH FOR A NUMBER OF MONTHS, BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS CANCER SEEMS TO RELAPSE IN ALMOST ALL CASES. [ SOFT GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING ] THERE'S AN OFF-LABEL DRUG ON THE MARKET. IT HASN'T PASSED FDA APPROVAL. IT ISN'T SUPPORTED BY INSURANCE-COMPANY POLICIES. &gt;&gt; JUST FOR ME NOW &gt;&gt; IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE, BUT IT MIGHT BUY SOME -- &gt;&gt; HOW MUCH TIME? &gt;&gt; IT DEPENDS. AT THIS STAGE, IT COULD BE SEVERAL MONTHS...OR DAYS. &gt;&gt; [ VOMITING ] &gt;&gt; AS LONG AS I HAVE YOU, I AS LONG AS I HAVE YOU, I FIGHT THE TEARS AS LONG AS I HAVE NOW, I'LL SAY A PRAYER AS LONG AS I HAVE NOW, I'LL FIGHT THE TEARS AS LONG AS I HAVE NOW, I'LL SAY A PRAYER I'LL BE ALL RIGHT [ INSTRUMENTAL BREAK ] I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU AS LONG AS I HAVE YOU I'LL FIGHT FOR YOU AS LONG AS I HAVE YOU I'LL FIGHT FOR YOU AS LONG AS I HAVE YOU I'LL FIGHT FOR YOU AS LONG AS I HAVE YOU I'LL FIGHT FOR YOU [ MUSIC STOPS ] [ HEART MONITOR BEEPING ] [ DOOR OPENS, CREAKS ] &gt;&gt; TIME FOR YOUR NEXT SESSION. &gt;&gt; I'M DONE. &gt;&gt; NOT YET, MR. FOSTER. CHEMO CAN TAKE SEVERAL SESSION-- &gt;&gt; I'M DONE. [ MONITOR BEEPING ] [ DOOR CLOSES ] [ DUCKS QUACKING ] [ BOTH CHUCKLE ] YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS 10, MY MOM -- SHE BROUGHT HOME A NEST OF DUCK EGGS SHE FOUND UNDER THIS BRIDGE. I LOOKED AFTER THEM FOR AWHILE, BUT -- BUT SHE WOULDN'T LET ME KEEP THEM. I REMEMBER THE DAY WE LET THEM GO. I WAS PRETTY UPSET. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT ENDED UP BEING THE MOST AMAZING PART. YOU SEE, THEY DIDN'T NEED ME ANYMORE. AS SOON AS THEY SPREAD THEIR WINGS, THEY WERE FREE. THEY OWNED THE SKY. THE VERY NEXT YEAR, I SAW A GROUP OF YOUNG DUCKS UNDER THE BRIDGE. THEY CAME BACK...EVERY YEAR. THERE'S JUST TWO LEFT NOW. [ DUCKS QUACKING ] &gt;&gt; OKAY, DANNY, NOW IT'S OUR TURN TO GUESS WHAT THE GIRLS WOULD SAY. GIRLS, WHAT'S ONE THING YOU COULD ALWAYS USE MORE OF? EVERYONE READY? &gt;&gt; MM-HMM. &gt;&gt; BABE? &gt;&gt; SHOES. &gt;&gt; [ SIGHS ] &gt;&gt; [ CHUCKLES ] &gt;&gt; Both: SHOES!

DANNY, THAT'S NOT HOW YOU PLAY THE GAME, MAN. &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN? &gt;&gt; IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SOMETHING LIKE SHOES OR BOOKS OR YOUR FAVORITE FOOD -- SOMETHING FUN. &gt;&gt; [ Chuckling ] BUT LOVE'S BETTER THAN ALL THAT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT THE POINT, MAN. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FUN. YOU CH-- &gt;&gt; COME ON. WE'RE HAVING FUN. THAT'S OUR POINT. PUT A SMILE ON YOUR FACE. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. NEXT QUESTION. [ INDISTINCT SPEAKING OVER P.A. ] &gt;&gt; I'LL GET TO SEE HER AGAIN SOON. OH, IT'S OKAY. I'M GONNA BE FINE. [ EXHALES ] [ CHUCKLES ] YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M THE LUCKIEST GUY IN THE WORLD. I MEAN, HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN SAY THAT THEY'VE TRULY BEEN IN LOVE, THAT THEY MET THE LOVE OF THEIR LIVES? I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME SOMETHING, SAM. PROMISE ME THAT -- WHATEVER HAPPENS -- YOU LISTEN TO YOURSELF BEFORE ANYONE ELSE... TO YOUR HEART. AND I WANT YOU TO GO THROUGH WITH THE SURGERY. WAIT FOR WHAT? I WANT TO BE THERE. I WANT TO -- [ LAUGHS ] I WANT TO BE THERE WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORLD AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME. I WANT TO HEAR YOUR BEAUTIFUL VOICE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN HEAR IT NOW. &gt;&gt; [ CHUCKLES ] &gt;&gt; [ SNIFFS ] [ Voice breaking ] I LOVE YOU, DANNY. &gt;&gt; I LOVE YOU, TOO, BABY. &gt;&gt; [ CRIES ] [ SNIFFS ] &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO, SAM? &gt;&gt; [ SNIFFS ] [ HEART MONITOR BEEPING ] &gt;&gt; [ EXHALES ] [ INDISTINCT SPEAKING OVER P.A. ] WELL...

THEN YOU'LL BE HERE IN RECOVERY OVERNIGHT. WE'VE FOUND THAT FOR PATIENTS LIKE YOURSELF WHO COULD HEAR FOR SEVERAL YEARS, IT'S GENERALLY EASIER TO LEARN TO ASSOCIATE THE SIGNALS PROVIDED BY THE IMPLANT WITH THE SOUNDS THAT YOU REMEMBER.
