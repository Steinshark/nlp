There's kinda like a community and everyone here just seems super chill. - They were playing a lot of music that I really enjoy and love. I had no clue that something like this was gonna be just randomly - For a place with no laws, this is actually pretty chill. And it's kinda like a community, everyone's getting along. I'm just kind of surprised in the middle of the desert you have this. - There's a lot of different - This is awesome. I honestly didn't expect this.

I'm outta here. - So the boys don't You can't just approach to Slab City and just be like, &quot;Yo, dance with me.&quot; They have to accept you. And so he was- - You don't know if he was - You just can't dance. - Oh God, no. Honestly don't care if but I just like making fun of him. So it's really funny that he didn't dance. - I'm gonna be honest. Chris is starting to get arrogant, 'cause he built the tents. It happens every time. I was told to talk about Haha, Chris - He won't do it 'cause - Yeah, I know. That's literally what I was thinking. Why would I make fun of So I'm in the tent and I'm not gonna lie. I feel exhausted.
