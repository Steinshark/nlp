Yiliang Roast Duck Duck The duck's fat is dripping out. Hmm. It smells good. Laifu, come on. Sis, why did you ask me to come here? To remove some bricks. Take them for me. OK. It's so heavy. You are really strong. All right. Laifu, let's go. It's too hot. Here, have a hardy banana. Hmm. Ahao! Have a hardy banana. It's super good. Very sweet. Yeah. Isn't it fun? Stop! Okay, you can get off now. Get off! Is it good? Hmm? Is it good? Oh, Penji! Yeah? You've had a busy day today. Good job. It's already slippery. You've been working on the oven all day and haven't had time to eat your meal yet. Is it flat, Uncle Aping? I think it's flat. A little more. Cement Paste Pine Needles No one has been gathering pine needles for the past two years, so there are plenty of them, mom. Yeah. There is a mushroom here. I'm not picking it. Mom, we need to stop, or else we won't be able to carry it. Oh, my! What big bundles! Mom, I'll carry these bundles. You carry the rest. Light the Oven Salt, Chili, Zanthoxylum, Sesame, Chopped Green Onion, Tsaoko Powder, Hot Oil It smells so good. There are still some pine needles left. Should we burn them? No, grandma. Wow! Done? Yes, Uncle Aping. This one is cooked well. It's very clean. Oven-baked Twisted Rolls While the oven was heating, I decided to bake some twisted rolls to see if they would turn out well. It turns out they taste good. This one's the best, grandma. Yes, it's really delicious. GinMao, it has chili inside, so you can't eat it. It's still crispy. Yeah. Crispy and tasty. I love these crispy twisted rolls. Don't scratch me, GinMao. Air-drying So slow. You're too slow, Wangwang! Aunt Qin. I'm back with the meat I bought. How should we prepare the meat? Let's roast it. Wangwang, it's cold today. Don't take a bath. Cooking Wine Salt, Zanthoxylum Powder, Tsaoko Powder Wangwang, I've hung the meat. We'll roast it later. Scalding Marinating with honey Air-drying Oh, it's hot! Laifu, can you smell the aroma of the roast duck? When it's done cooking, I'll give you and Dawang half of it first. Oh, dear! Doesn't the duck smell good? You guys stay here and be good. The roast duck smells so good! I'll bring it to you. Wow! Oh, this duck isn't cooked right. The color of this one is uneven. Let's give it to Dawang to see if it's good. Look! It smells good! This duck smells so good. Let's try the skin first. Eat the skin. It's not hot, so you don't have to turn away. You think it's hot and will burn you? Laifu! Eat it. Wow, it's so hot! Does it taste good? Chew it. Take your time. Don't eat the bone. Why did you eat the bone? Let's re-roast them tomorrow. Master Qin, take a look! Should they be air-dried this much? Yeah! Just pay attention to the heat when you roast them. OK. I'll have a try. Oh, my! This one is so well cooked. Yeah, it's really good. It's golden, Penji. The duck from yesterday wasn't well roasted. Yeah. It's better than that one. Turn it around. It's golden, darling. Yeah. Oh, my goodness, everything is smothered in the big oven. Roast Duck Take two and chop them up. You haven't eaten your meal, honey. Take it to school. It's too big. Just take it and eat it. All right. Be careful on the road. Yeah. Let's pick a good one. Aunt Ahui, I made an oven, and roasted ducks. Eight ducks. Have a try. Crispy Pork Belly Minced Garlic Spicy Sauce Chili, Green Onion, Hot Water Chili, Garlic Dried Chili Peanuts, Sesame Hot Oil Cilantro Sliced Duck Uncle Aping, come on! Coming! Let's eat. We're waiting for you to eat the roast duck. Come on, let's eat. Coming! Brother, come on! I want to eat a duck leg. Hurry up! How can we finish all this food in the big pot? It must be around 30 or 40 jin in weight. How is it possible? Roast Duck Hotpot What is this? The vegetables underneath also taste good. You've got sharp eyes. That's a big duck leg. I'll turn it over for you. There are vegetables at the bottom. They're all delicious. Qiqi is not here. If he were here, he'd love it. He loves eating ducks, just like you. Yesterday I ate the duck by myself and finished over half of it. Because of that, I even sounded hoarse. I can eat two of these ducks. Is the duck today good or the duck from yesterday? Both are good. They're both good. Take your time. Don't drop it. Eating too much is not good for my stomach. No. It won't hurt your stomach. You love eating vegetables. I'm not the same as in the past few years I used to be able to eat several bowls of food. The skin is good. The roast duck in a hotpot tastes even better. I have to eat a big bowl of soybeans and a big bowl of fried dried beef. That's it. That's how I fill my belly. Oh, my! You really have an appetite. Let me wrap the duck in the pancake for you. What a cold day today! It's cold tonight. Too cold. Listen, I sound a bit hoarse. Yesterday I roasted many ducks, but they didn't look good, so I ate a lot. Here, have this. It's for grandma. Very delicious. I should have skipped lunch. You're our guest and you've stumbled upon this meal, so please help yourself to more. Yes, Second Brother, have some more. Here you go, the pork belly. Have one piece, auntie. Just one piece. Two pieces. Have two pieces. That's too much. Don't worry. Cheers! When you're drinking, try taking small sips and making some noise. It can enhance the flavor of the wine. Let's see if I make some noise. Yes. But... Look, you didn't make any noise. That's not true. I always make big noise. I can finish this bowl of food, even if it's too much. The vegetables taste good. Come on, grandma. Have some cabbage. This bowl of food smells so good, especially the roast duck. That's the smell of the roast duck. Take these two ducks home. They are for auntie and Alan.
