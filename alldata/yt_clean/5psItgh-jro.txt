This is my lunchbox and I was about to say some kind of a backstory that in Russia, in Russia It's not that popular I was diagnosed with like autoimmune and like I really gained a lot of weight And since that time like &quot;Mom, I really want like I don't want to eat And she's like: &quot;Okay&quot;. Like she didn't put me on diet but she was and I really loved it -So. -I love your lunchbox. -Wow, you totally made it. And it's like because we do have something Okay, okay, it's not, It's like the cutlet, and the, like, the patty. Wow, oh! You know, it's a good lunch, I would say. Like, the cutlet dish is like-- I think you, -Yeah. -Let's split. Cheers! Okay, cheers, guys. Kolya already ate his, but cheers! Cheers! Wow, cool. Mmm. It's so good. And if you feel a little bit, you know, you want some fresh taste after the cutlet, we do have some cucumbers. Yeah! Do you eat cucumbers often? Like, daily? Every day. Is there a certain name for the sandwich? Don't tell anyone. I think Kolya has some inspiration from you. We'll see. Now we're moving to my favorite ever part, ever. This one is syrniki. It's called syrniki. Syrniki. Syrniki. It really contains a lot of like, it contains milk, like protein, there is like some other ingredients. It- you may make it with just a little amount of sugar. I'm so excited to try it. This one is one of the most popular breakfasts in Russia. Syrniki with, you can eat it with literally everything. I'm gonna wait for you guys. Mm. Mm. It is. Oh, it's so good. And honestly, it's like- How do you feel about it? -You love it? Wow. It's tasty. Very tasty. And with Syrniki, if you want something sweet or... Not apples, you can never go wrong with apples, so. Apples are hard all the time. Yeah. Cheers to apples. An apple a day keeps the doctor away. Now we're getting to some kind of a really, I would say a grown-up Katyushka part, because this one is not something I would definitely drink when I was a child, but this is something I drink till now. This is the just plain black iced Americano. I drink it every single day. Okay. I love it. Wow. First time drinking coffee? Yeah. For me, it's too strong. I used to think that, but after I started to drink it all the time, then it's like, I totally get used to the vibe. But please don't really get addicted to coffee. Try to find another way. Yeah. I really like the syrniki and the sandwich. I- I feel like I want to eat that every day too. So thank you for sharing. Thank you! The food was really good. If it tasted like that then it's like a lot -of love for a mom to make that. That's true. Thank you! -I loved it! I think we should see my copycat lunchbox. From Nick. Yeah, we should. [NICK'S LUNCHBOX] Let's unbox the lunchbox for a real strong man, a real optimum dark man, and look at this. It's a black bag. Wow. With a black drink. Uh-huh. Wow. Let's open it. Total black look. With me. Total black look. With the black hair. I think it's just like Nick, black on the outside and inside It's a little... Ooooh. Wow it just keeps on going.. Kolya starts cooking. Yeah, with protein. Wow. Wow. Is that barley? What is it? No, we start from the sandwich. It's sandwich with butter and cheese. I remember I always ate it when I was six, seven years old. Cheers! Finally, the first cheers! Mmm! Usual Russian breakfast. Okay, the next one. It's a buckwheat with milk. It's also Russian breakfast. I loved this and still love it so much. Have you eaten before? Did you eat before, this? No, no, I've never tried. -For you, it's the first time. Yeah! And you know that, Russian people say you need to eat more porridge and you will get stronger. That's why I'm big now. Breakfast from Kolyunya. I don't even remember what it looks like. Buckwheat is really rich in fiber. Like super rich in fiber. It's healthy. It looks like oats or something that's so good for you. But I think that it's more sweeter, it's more better with sugar. But I don't use sugar. I will finish when everyone tries it. Wow, it's so simple. It tastes like cereal. Yeah, it does. I love that, like, I can really tell that you guys have, like, a memory, like, around this taste. Yeah, definitely. It is unusual. Thank you for sharing. Thank you. The next one, hard-boiled eggs. Also, I eat one egg with yolk and other four without. I feel like you can also cut an egg and, you know, just put it on the butter and cheese. Can I? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but usually I eat only eggs without salt... Without salt. Without salt, without bread. And I see for your last thing you have a little copy in your bag. I'm sorry, yeah, it's a cucumber. It's my favorite vegetable, and It's because I have to. It's very useful. It's a fiber. Yeah. That's... Need to eat it every single day. And the last one, It's cold brew. What's the difference? I don't know. Close your eyes. Can you tell the difference? Yeah, let's go. Where? Is it? Which one? Ice Americano. Yeah. Wow, thank you, Kolya. Super healthy, super protein packed. Yeah. It's my first time having this cereal and also having just bread with cheese and butter. So it really, I feel like I'm learning so much. Thank you. I'm happy to share it with you. Yeah! Woo! Thank you. Yay! Yay! Boba time! Lena! All right, you guys. I think my lunchbox is so unique and it's so different. It's so cute. Look at the strawberries. It's like you use strawberry and cream. Are you ready? Ooh! So the dish that we have here is traditional Russian crepes with caviar, but we call it blinchiki. It's like Lenchik. Like Lenchik, yeah. So it's blinchiki, with caviar. So I have two here. There's really caviar inside? Yeah, you need to try. -And I'm sure you've never tried this before. You need to try! Yay! Should we break it in half like this? And when I was a child, it was my favorite breakfast ever. It's so good! So, how do you feel about it? So good. I love this in sushi, because sometimes they put it in sushi for caviar. The next thing that we have here is actually cucumbers, but not the fresh one, it's pickled cucumbers. I started actually eating it here, when I came to the US, but in Russia it's a really popular thing to have, so here you go. I actually can't, I can't eat pickles. Like, really? I don't know why I'm gonna take a small bite. All right. I just, I can't. So you're ready for the next one... At this moment. Let's have a shock. Wow, what is that? This one is mozzarella balls. Wow! So when I was, like, a child, my mom always spent a lot of time preparing salads and everything and I used to steal this Mozzarella balls because -they're just so- Yeah, it's just also simple. Wow, I love them. I love it. Oh, yeah, cherry. Yeah, oh, yeah. Thank you Lena, thank you Lena. And I see some special- Special treat, I guess. Sweets? Special treat is actually my favorite sweet thing ever and it's a crumble cookie. Wow! I actually don't know what -This is the churros! Oh my gosh, dude, I love churros. That's so good. I'll go second. All right, after Nick. Crumble cookies are so insane. That one is so good. Wow. I want to try. Ten out of ten. Time to drink. Oh, wow. Boba! Alright guys, you go first. I've seen Lena's video, so I know that it's good. I remember when boba was really famous in Malaysia too. And they call it bubble tea. Yeah. It's one brand everywhere? You know, it's just like the type of drink. Sometimes they don't even have a brand. It's just so sweet. I think it's a brand. For example, I can... I do not eat any sweets, but I drink boba. I think I liked Lena's lunch the best. I think boba 10 out of 10. -It was like super, a lot of sweet treats. Thanks guys for watching. Comment below which lunchbox was your favorite. Bye!
