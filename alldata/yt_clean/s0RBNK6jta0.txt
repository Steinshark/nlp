The boys are shooting, we should help them. Our infantry is covering it, right? They try to shoot back. Well, this is a tank. A tank rolls. I want to go in that direction, there are tanks there, watch there. Plus, we'll see -- will shoot. Shot! Ilyuha, came in. &quot;Toadstool&quot;, I'm &quot;Bison&quot;. Do you hear? I am sorting out the inactive. Similarly. Plus-plus. Foggy. Foggy. You see, they are taking advantage of this weather. They drive when a fog, right? They are more daring. When it is foggy, assault operations may begin. Well, easy. Tactical weather. Tactical weather. Rainy, foggy. Specifically, our unit is unlucky with such weather. Why? Well, because it's just that good goals appear. And we are like kittens. I am &quot;Good&quot;. We took off. The Russianss mainly make all their movements at night. During the day, they realize that they are very clearly visible. And at night they think that everything is very good. And we can see all this very well with a thermal imager. And they fly away very beautifully. So shut up. Five. What? The tank from afar. Foggy. Foggy. Take the grass. Yura, come here. It won't work here. It comes out audibly. Op. Yes, followed by it. Finished. Raise it even higher. Come on. That's what I put! Here is wet clay. Nazar, open the lianda. They may not work. Zero visibility. Bad weather conditions. Kolyan, your time has come. And this, **ck... Maybe it's not time yet? And who has been working now? Better take it rightly. Isn't this a tank? He is there somewhere, flashes of it can be seen. Yes. Turn on normally. Zoom. There is. Look, there is? Yes. Sit there. Verification. The grass will not give. Yura. Look at the grass, Yura. The grass is far away, I guess. That grass, damn it. It will not disturb you. Where is it? There was just a flash here. Something doesn't move, nothing. Well, I also saw the flash. Bloody fog. Fog. Come on, come on, shoot at that box. Work. Take it off, take it off. We are working. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on. Yes. Oh! Yes. Yes. This is not. The main thing. Hit. Yes, let's go for the next one. With a pencil. Cherkes, you didn't hit there, did you? The rocket fell. I so suspect that it hit the ground. In weather conditions, the rocket is not so visible. Well, look, already. You think we shot it by silhouette. It was not immediately clear what it was. And it is already clearly visible that the tank is equipped with a barbecue. The boys shoot back. F**k. Somehow to help. They try to shoot back. Well, well, a tank. It hided. I think we threw it under the goosebumps. And they also realized that it is better for a tank not to stand here. What, work. And I'll go and be nervous myself a little. So bad, so bad. Could help the infantry, guys. And here it is. The weather played so not good with us. But anyway, they stopped shooting. This is already, I think, saved a little blood for the infantry. Weare going to wait for it here. Another one is going. Come here. Cherkes, another one is coming. There in the same place. Do you see? Oh, that's it. Yes, do the calibration fast. Let's do it. Let's check. Come on. So, commander, are we working? If you see a goal, then working. Here it is, here it goes. Let's go to the left, there we will see where our &quot;Bekha&quot; is. No, I think it stopped there between the trees. There it stands, yes. Yes, Yes, Yes. But there are many trees, Yurko. No, no. Yes, Commander, I'm shooting. But wait. It will stop now. But where will it be? It is already hitting. It does no to hit, it goes to storm. How do you know? Did you sit in the same cabin with driver? BMW &quot;Bekha&quot; went there. He stood for landing, and we will not get him. Turn off combat mode for now. They work on it. Arrival, arrival Minus so far. Do you think you didn't get it the first time? I think I got it. I think I didn't get it. If he went, he didn't hit it. To the side. And why didn't he go? Well, he left. May damaged. But it is not working now. Does not work. The second has arrived, do you see? Here, no, it will be a reception. Oh, it's them. Here. Woke up. My second contract I signed in 2019. Well, it's already with this brigade. Is it already over? Already finished, of course. We want to go home. Does it continue automatically? Until the end of martial law? Until the end of martial law. So we don't have martial law. Well, in short, all this shit. You will be in the army until old age. Yes. Don't smile, you will be too. And I acted in a movie. I received four thousand per day. Well, like here. Only with all conditions. Well, I would like to act in something so fantasy. No, earlier I thought of acting in action films, but if... Life is enough here. And all the more now I look at the actors. Which are, like, super cool. I know their stories, how they hid in cellars. And they were afraid that they would not be given a summons. And now they are filming as soldiers. This is terribly maddening. I once had a funny story. I was studying at the military department then, graduating. We filmed the TV series &quot;Fast&quot;. And we used to go between scenes with one actor. He said, Nazar, you are not a warrior. Here I am, a boy. And so on. And I was always very kind on the set. Well, like God's dandelion. And the war began. I mobilized immediately. From the first war days. I was still in the Kyiv region at that time. In the beginning, it was a lot of &quot;fun&quot; in the Kyiv region. In short, as in every region. And he called me somehow. I do not know. 2 months ago. Samael, I am Bison. Bison, I'm Samael. Plus, plus. Let them be. - Did you call? - Yes, he called, he says, damn it, Nazar, what should I do, they gave me a summons, how can I do it so that I stay in Kyiv. I think you were telling me what a cool warrior you are, what happened in your life. There are actually a lot of such stories. - Plus, plus. &quot;Shopopalo, Shopopalo&quot;, I'm Samuel, if you hear, then sort it out, welcome. - Did you call Shopopalo? -- Shopopalo, yes, the call sign for the surname Shapovalov. &quot;Shopopalo?&quot; Well, that's all. -- Technician, Technician, I'm Samuel, if you can hear, understand, take it. - I have Toadstool. - Why Toadstool? - Because I eat fly agarics. - Seriously? - Seriously. Red, dry. Microdosing. I have been for almost a year. Peace, calmness in the soul, in general like that. - Red - it was in the beginning, now... - Panther? - Panther, yes. I now eat a panther mushroom cap in the morning, well, about a gram. - A week later, I fell asleep thinking that I was falling asleep like a child. Well, not at all. Because it wasn't before that I woke up, when we were taken out from under Bakhmut last year, I woke up 5-6 times a night. Well, it is not clear why. Not that there is a toilet, but just waking up. And then, somewhere last fall, I came across a video about microdosing. Then I read, then I tried. It was scary. Well, all my life people told me that the amanita mushroom is a poisonous mushroom that can kill you. Yeah, actually. - Quietly. Motolyga - No, it's a tank. - This is a tank. - It's a tank, it's not a motolyga. Such a suggestive one. - Negative thoughts came out of my head. -- Toadstool, Toadstool, I'm Cherkes. -- Cherkes and Toadstool on the line. -- Toadstool, don't hit it our way. - Plus-plus. We already understood. - You see, it's foggy now. On the one hand, the drones don't work, which is why they by the tank so close. It is more difficult to detect them from the ATGM, from the same Javelin, because of the fog. And during the day they are almost invisible. But not that it is almost invisible, they are not visible here. - At all? - Yes. Because here now... - Yes, yes. Recently, it's FPV drones. Everything will depend on FPV drones in the future. -- Much safer on a drone. - And cheaper. - And cheaper, yes. A shot from Stugna -- that's $20,000 flying in right now. Rocket. -- There may be such an apartment somewhere in Okhtyrka. - Yes, it's easy. -- And an FPV drone -- 450-500 dollars. -- The cheapest. - Well, depending on which one. - But still convey what will be on the left, then let them put it out. Tell me if you see equipment with grills on top - it's not ours. There are no barbecues at our place. If you don't know what this is, the topic is so far-fetched. - Mushrooms are a topic. I regret that I only found out about it late. - How much for you? - Oh, I'm 50 without a year, a year and two months. - Yes. In January, it will be 49. - A year goes in two. - But I don't count that. A year in two. - What did you do in general? - I was a railway worker. I worked on the railway for 22 years. - And when did you mobilize? -- I did not mobilize, I signed a contract in 2020. - What, the assault has been repelled, it has been repelled. How not how. - There is a threat of one more. That he can leave. - But the fog has already cleared. Will they leave again? - Unlikely. - I don't know either. -- If you see enemy equipment, evacuation equipment, enemy, destroy the target. How was it received? - Accepted. Plus. - What to evacuate? We didn't hit. - No, maybe someone will be picked up there after landing. - Maybe there, ***ck. - Well, be quiet. - Something so interesting. Maybe a load? - Wait, wait, it's me. There MT-LB. -- MT-LB? - Plus, plus, accepted. - Yes, come back. - It's all shining now. -- Cherkes, I am Samael. Wherever the Russian tanks used to drive, these MT-LBs ride there. - Let's say &quot;plus&quot;. - Accepted, we are looking for it. - Shit, well, MT-LB a little shorter, we can't see it. - Ask. - Yes, yes. - Ask, assholes are running there, aren't they? - He did not give russians to the campaign. -- Samael, Samael. - I am Cherkes. - And you can't see the infantry nearby, near it? - It is not visible, because they saw the movement of the infantry. -- Yes, Nazar, look, if anything, work. I'll go find out why. - Where do they see it? - Full of Bekha, full of russians, he said. - Yes, let's go to combat mode. Now we get up and work. Samael, Samael, I'm Cherkes. Let's see. But it will come in now. We are not liquidating it, it is now on its way. All. It will now go to the side. They said there were two cars rolling. We don't see it. The car went aside. -- See the tanks - work immediately. - Plus, plus. - From the left? - To the left of landing. A tank drives by. Back. Come on, don't be shy. - Nazar, tell me, do we need such bullshit in our shift? - I do not know. - What, you don't like it so much? - But it's cool. If we had removed one, we would have already been on the mend. - It's fun for them, but we don't need it anymore. - Let the blood be felt. There are two ***ed here. - There is a gap at the intersection, you see, the smoke is rising. - There are some gaps now. Plus, plus, there was a gap. - Well, there are tanks in that direction, damn it, watch there. - We are watching there. - Plus, we'll see - Hit it, let's go. - Oh, cluster shells, see? - Go. - Some are lying down, some are shivering, some are surrendering, in short. - Russians? - Yes. - Arta poured well. - And what, there was an assault? - Yes. - There is such a road and they lie there, in short. - Cassettes. - I think that... - God's punishment. - Five fell. - That's how many cassettes were poured there. - But all the same, they tried that it is possible to drive up here by vehicle. - They poured it right away. - And they poured it on us. - It was directly poured. - At that time, one of us was taken away from our position. - Wounded by a fragment of the right side. - And the rest were all badly concussed. - And even a shard of NLAW broke through. - So that I open my eyes for the time being, and it has a spark in front of my eyes. - If he wanted to do something, pour water, wherever you pour it, the marching engine, well, the starting engine, started working right in the trench. - And the rocket didn't go out. - And that would be the case in general. - The British have thought this situation through. - Let's ban someone today. - They run away there. - They run away there. They leave something. - Somewhere from here, from another tank, they enter on the right side. - And they enter from here. - We see, we see. The car is boarding. - Yes, upon boarding. - The rocket fuc***, that's all. - Why do you think that it failed? - Failed, it didn't get in. - Ready, ready. - Let's do the next one. - There is a tank in the middle of the field, watch. - 15 meters. - Plus, plus. - They screwed up. - Do many surrender? I mean in captivity? - Well, in a sense, maybe you already know the number. - Well, they saw two for sure. - The two of them surrendered. - The boys all undressed and went to rest. - Their assault did not succeed. - Well, they were welcomed very warmly. - As soon as you can shoot, work immediately. - Understood, accepted. - Cherkes, have you recharged? - Plus, plus. - We have reloaded, we are looking for a target. - Plus, plus, where the Russians flew. - Plus, plus. - Give to the left. - Look, they are throwing traps for &quot;Bekha&quot; over there. - The car is being worked on now. - Look, don't screw up our tank. - They were accepted, reception. - Samael, I found something similar, a similar silhouette. - Only I don't know if it is it or not. - Toadstool went to you there. - It should stand in front or back. - How is it? - Well, there it is, a dark spot. - So that I don't spend 20 bucks on a stump now. - Maybe to the left again? - See what else is there. - Understand. - Why won't we see it? - How will you see it? - What are these landings? - Our landings. - Well, you're right, I guess you've led me further. - And to our left, before this landing. - Show me, here we see this landing. - As? No. - This is the landing. - Are you funny? - Do you see this car for sure? - We don't see. - I said that we will not see it from there. - This one, just a silhouette. - I'm not sure if it's a joke. It does not burn anything there. - But it's not it. But it already burns black. - So in our boarding is this car? - Yes. - Well, what's the point? - You see, there is still a minus in Stugna, he said. - The thigh does not work. The art is working now. - And what in our landing do we need to carry out Stugna? - And what do we see on landing? - That's all, next to it. - Well, the upper one. - Well, look where the arrival is. - Well, here's the arrival. - He flew there, **poison. - Well, that's not the case. - Not that one. But it burns black. - Yeah. - Plus, I can see where it is. - No, that's not the case. - But you are not looking there. - We have to look along the landing. - Oh, it is. - Arrival. - Close. - Oh, that's all, come on, this arrival was. - Yura. - There are no other landings here, understand. - Landing that goes along. - Not across. - You look sideways. - Phew, where is the transverse one, Yura? That's it, ***ck, transverse. Here, here goes the transverse one. - Well, let me see. - Why is she still oriented to you, Stugna? - We had to put Stugna on that side. - What are you going to do? Now leave before you shoot. - But ours, because it goes without it. - Is the tank moving? - Plus, plus, tank, yes. - There they are somewhere on the left. The point is that, even if ours are not in, ***ck. - Missile, bitch, fucked up. - So clearly, a Russian tank or something like that was driving. - It is already leaving for our side of the landing, see. - Bah, that's it, the rocket is not visible in the monitor at all. - Ah, that's all, I understood. - This is the fact that the first tank is two projects. - So it was already heard that we were being targeted? - Yes, here, look. Oh, she's leaving now. - This is the intersection, this way. - Well, I left already. - Ah, that's what I wanted. - No. - It comes out. - Well, in short, they basically go there for something, do you understand? - They are leaving from that side, if something... - No. - It left on our, well, on our side of the landing. - I can already clearly see this side. - Huh. - And the rocket went off. I say. - Yes, okay. - Yes, we are waiting. - What is he shouting? - What is not clear. - What? - Fuh, what are you doing to me? - This is our landing. - Just the one where we are looking. - What is our landing? - Fuh, yes, where do we look, where we are oriented. - So that I listen to you once again with your advice... - Our landing, where our tank went. - This is our landing. - Why is our tank here? - Where was the car? - Bekha is standing there, on the right side. - But this landing is what is needed. - Where is the landing here, draw it for me, please. - But those landings. - Why am I running here and there? - Yura! - What's going on? - Go explain to him. - Yura, this is the landing that is needed, what about you? - He showed me, poked with his finger, kwa-kwa-kwa, here is the copter driver. - I would go to Nikita, I say, this is a landing and that this is bullshit, right? - Yes, he says, it's this. - Maybe Nikita was choosing a position here, maybe he knows a little better. - And where is Beha-car? - Beha is landing, we won't see it. - Why are we telling you? - Which of these is bullshit! - And your will work on this car now, right? - Well, they throw Bekha there. - Look, they are throwing for Bekha there. You are working on this car now. Just watch, don't disturb our tank. How was the received? - Cherkes as soon as you see them, immediately shoot. - Plus, plus. - Yes, back. - It drives right in the middle of the field. - I show what you see on the screen. - Do you see it or not? - Cherkess, minus, I don't see, I don't see. - So you don't see anything? - On that side, we have a dead zone. - From that Nikita should see. - If you see, then shoot. - I do not know what. - Plus, accepted. - Yes, do you shoot? - The ear. - Shot! - You can go a little lower. - Oh, it's crazy. - Finally. - Did you move anything at all? - What kind of rocket? - And the calibration is correct. - Well, where did it fly anyway? What is it like this? - Go and explain, I'm done. - Did you leave or did you screw up? - They screwed up, it didn't get up on the laser. - Stugna did not fly there. - Charge the next one. - It will be, it will be. - And send someone to Bison. - Goes across the field. - Well, that's all, Bekha was hit by a tank. - This is Bekha, it ran into a mine, then the mortar finished it off. - Bekha was generally shot there. - They started shooting, it smoked, started to burn. - It's not burning - it's smoking, that's all. - Such is the story. - Well, it's on the map. - I can show you the picture someday. - I have it hanging somewhere. - Well, Bekha is standing, you see. - Here she tried twice, Bekha came alone, tried to evacuate, she was covered. - It started everything, you see, friends, they try everything. - Here is a whole bunch of them, here is a whole bunch of them. - They are trying to get out here a little, get out a little here. - Well, I say, they are all there, at least three hundred, and there are definitely shrapnel wounds. - When you are ready to fire, report to me. - Yes, a shot! - Get up, dear, get up. - Yeah. - Yes. - Whoah! - Ah-ah-ah! - Oh, yes, they burned it! - Guys, handsome guys! - Commander, did you see it? - Whore, assholes! - Burn in the heat! - By force, out of four shots - one. - Did you hit? - Yes. - Yes? - Yes. - Beauties. - Well, they hit it, it's finally. - We need a barbecue there. - But where? - He is already flying away, now I will look at the second one. - Did you see it? - We did not see the arrival, we already saw how it burned. - Ok. - I understand that. - Now you can fight. - I cried twice in my life. The first time I got married, the second time I looked at this guy. - I really want to cry from joy. - What a beauty! - That's how it works, guys. - F***. - That's nice. - Do you see it, is it burning? - I passed out. - What? - Only the Russian burns there. - Is this someone's ass? - Yes, yes. Smoked. - Is it burning? - Yes, it is burning.
