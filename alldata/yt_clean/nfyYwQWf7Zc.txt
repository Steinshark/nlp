This time, I would like to express my gratitude to Kagoshima, my hometown. Photographed by the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force &quot;Ground Self-Defense Force Amami Garrison&quot; The other day, a cooking competition was held for disaster relief personnel, and I took a photo of it. (Cooking competition: A cooking competition designed for disaster situations) The Ground Self-Defense Force Amami Garrison is the front line of defense for the Southern Islands, and approximately 420 members are permanently stationed there. It consists of a surface-to-ship guided missile operation unit and an electronic warfare unit. Amami Garrison is a relatively new garrison, so there is a shooting range with new equipment. Today's guns are much looser, My previous gun had a shock that made my shoulders hurt. The impact of the machine gun was so great that my shoulder turned red. When you shoot, it will show you where it hit. Here, everyone shoots like this, &quot;Bang, bang&quot; The equipment here measures the distance from the center of the target in millimeters. Performance is much better than the previous one (We also have equipment that allows for vehicle-based shooting training and night shooting training.) ``Sustainable Running Competition'' Participants wear equipment weighing more than 5 kg, such as backpacks and horizontal bars, and compete for speed in squads. Check equipment Check that your equipment weighs more than 5kg The course goes around the base and is a tough course due to the slopes. Aiming for the goal while supporting each other It's called a raincoat, but it's a raincoat. It's called a &quot;nap cover&quot; and is meant for napping. It's like a sleeping bag the next day &quot;Cooking Competition&quot; Cooking will be held in preparation for disaster relief dispatch. Cook chicken curry, pork soup, and ham salad using the same ingredients (Outdoor cooking equipment: Towed outdoor cooking equipment that can be used for cooking such as rice) To prevent food poisoning, we strictly check hygiene aspects such as nail growth. The time from the start to the end of cooking is fixed. Cook the same menu using the same ingredients within the time limit Cooking will be done according to the method planned for each team. Setting up a cooking area "I will cook white rice in this." "This is a potato peeler." ``Please wash your hands every time you touch the food.'' Communicate cooking methods and hygiene precautions for the troop. &quot;I'd like to make sure you do it.&quot; (Disinfect cooking utensils with boiling water before use) While each person is working on their own process, they work together to help with any processes that are delayed while cooking. (I check to see if the rice is cooked by smelling it) (Actually, on this day, there was a problem with the equipment. Even though he was cooking the rice as usual, the smell was different, and at this point he felt something was wrong.) "Have you added the ingredients, added water, and lit the fire?" "Maybe I should cook it a little more." Learn how rice is cooked by smell and improve your cooking ability &quot;Vehicle competition&quot; Compete for vehicle handling ability of security guards "This amount will keep you warm for a while." (They cook with this in mind in case of a disaster,so we are conscious of providing a warm meal.) &quot;good!&quot; &quot;delicious&quot; ``My name is Second Sergeant Mizoi, and I am serving as the head chef.'' ``The menu this time was designed with disaster relief in mind , so there are a few things I focused on.'' ``I cooked the curry with the goal of making a dish that everyone in the disaster-stricken area could eat, from infants to the elderly.'' `` I cooked the ``My preference is curry with large.'' I made it so that it was a size that anyone could eat.'' ``My preference is curry with large ingredients. I prepared it that way because it was intended for disaster relief. ``For the pork soup, we make it mild so that the strong flavor of ginger and other condiments does not come out as strong.'' `` We make it with the aim of making it edible for everyone from children to the elderly.'' &quot;It was really delicious!&quot; What made you become a SDF member? &quot;Because my parents' house was near Kokubu Garrison in Kagoshima Prefecture.&quot; &quot; When I was in elementary school, I participated in a trial enlistment for the SDF and thought it was a good experience.&quot; At that time, a SDF member was very kind to me, &quot;He told me that he would be waiting for me in the SDF in the future.&quot; I worked hard to become a SDF member. What do you think is good about becoming a member of the Self-Defense Forces? "The best part was being able to meet all kinds of people." ` `I started interacting with people of different ages that I would never have interacted with before,'' and ``Relationships with people have become the most important thing.'' Is training difficult? ``The biggest thing that's difficult is that I'm not alone.'' ` `My seniors are working hard, and my classmates are working hard ,too.'' My juniors are also working hard.'' ``We train while encouraging each other.'' `` My friends are the most important thing.'' What made you decide to become a Self-Defense Forces officer? "My uncle is a former member of the Self-Defense Forces, and he encouraged me to become a member of the Self-Defense Forces." What kind of unit do you belong to? ``I mainly belong to the reconnaissance unit.'' ' ``When the road collapses, I use my motorcycle to go first to areas where cars cannot pass.'' ` `I first check the situation on the ground and inform the rear troops.'' That will be my job.'' What do you think is good about becoming a member of the Self-Defense Forces? ``I've been involved in disaster relief work,'' ``and when I was removing rubble, I was told ``thank you'' by the surrounding residents.'' "It really touched my heart and I felt it was worth it."
