&gt;&gt; Tonight on FRONTLINE Episode One of a special &gt;&gt; You created the mess we're in and now you're &gt;&gt; Inside the financial crisis... &gt;&gt; Wall Street got bailed out and Main Street &gt;&gt; How did we get here? &gt;&gt; Other banks were taking these ideas and &gt;&gt; Once the seed was planted there wasn't &gt;&gt; We never imagined they were just taking it turned into a Frankenstein monster. &gt;&gt; Money, Power and Wall Street: Episode One. Tonight on FRONTLINE. &gt;&gt; Every day, tens of thousands of workers They work for banks, brokerages, hedge funds, It is the largest single sector of the American the size of America's manufacturing sector, reach. It is the industry that led America and the the Great Depression. The banks say they exist to create wealth, to invest the trillions of dollars that stream accounts that belong to all of us. One morning in the fall of 2011, bankers arriving &gt;&gt; This is what democracy looks like! We got sold out, banks got bailed out! &gt;&gt; On the sidewalk! You must go on the sidewalk! &gt;&gt; The recession had destroyed $11 trillion A recovery seemed far off. Occupy Wall Street wanted bankers held responsible. &gt;&gt; Most Americans think, and with good reason, didn't. We have very high unemployment. We lost 8.5 million jobs in the recession. People's houses aren't worth what they paid A lot of them don't have jobs. Their kids are graduating from college and &gt;&gt; This is what democracy looks like! &gt;&gt; It is pretty clear, actually, that there And if somebody with subpoena power was intent really much doubt that they would be quite &gt;&gt; We are the 99 percent! We are the 99 percent! &gt;&gt; In a matter of weeks, Occupy demonstrations and the world, calling for radical changes Bankers responded by saying that the answer &gt;&gt; Some of our companies made a series of all paid for them, including-- and-- and-- &gt;&gt; But what makes people upset is that -- I that are on the streets demonstrating, Occupy recovered but banks have. &gt;&gt; If you want a strong economy, you have are safe and sound and able to lend and able Now, if you want to have a recession, then and you know, make sure that they're-- that recession. &gt;&gt; Do you understand why they're angry? Do you have any comment? Mr. Blankfein, can we ask you a question, Can you give the American people an accounting And do you understand why it is they're are Do you have any regrets about the way you &gt;&gt; Since the meltdown of 2008, there have &gt;&gt; --and we regret that people have lost And whatever we did, whatever the standards &gt;&gt; I would like to ask your opinion of the &gt;&gt; Many questions have been asked-- &gt;&gt; --in contributing to the financial crisis. &gt;&gt; --but there have been few satisfying &gt;&gt; What goes on at Wall Street and exactly where we are-- it's difficult to understand &gt;&gt; I'm not sure I understand that point. Maybe you could elaborate. &gt;&gt; Well, I think that it's-- in many ways, I think our regulators and the industry have &gt;&gt; But at the end of the day, people usually wrong. &gt;&gt; Somehow, we just missed, you know, that &gt;&gt; What is a synthetic CDO? &gt;&gt; A CDO is a pool of assets-- &gt;&gt; I think finance may have gotten too complicated &gt;&gt; --that are pooled together and then can In a synthetic, you pool reference securities mortgage. &gt;&gt; --and that the managers of these large given an impossible task, that they won't are doing. And that is really, really scary. &gt;&gt; You created the mess we're in, and now Trust us.&quot; You created CDOs. You created credit default swaps that never Who was the brilliant person who came and Find him! Fire him! &gt;&gt; It's hard to pinpoint the origins of America's resort in Boca Raton, Florida, is a good place Assembled here in June 1994 were a group of At the time, it all seemed innocent enough. &gt;&gt; Boca Raton was a gathering of people that JP Morgan, in part as a celebration, in part more importantly, as an opportunity to get room to discuss a whole variety of different ..And since they were young, mostly in their around and they were full of high spirits, do and they got drunk. They had parties. They threw each other in pools. You know, this is the normal stuff that happens &gt;&gt; Yes, I went into the pool fully clothed, Some people drank, some people didn't. And I'm happy to say that, like, most people &gt;&gt; They played hard. But they also worked hard. They were striving to address an age-old problem The first journalist to tell the full story &gt;&gt; They began to look for ways to enable them. One way to do that was to sell loans. Another way, though, was to separate out the And out of that came this drive to develop &gt;&gt; Credit default swaps, a kind of derivative Traditionally, derivatives were a way to bet For hundreds of years, farmers have traded fluctuating crop prices. It is this type of derivative that has been along with the futures of fuels, currencies In Boca Raton, the JP Morgan team realized trade their loan risks. &gt;&gt; Bankers borrowed one set of ideas that and applied it to loans for the first time. This idea was essentially created under the &gt;&gt; The first big credit default swap was engineered &gt;&gt; Exxon was the client at the bank, and relationship. &gt;&gt; The Exxon Valdez spewed almost 11 million &gt;&gt; In the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill dollar letter of credit with JP Morgan. &gt;&gt; A letter of credit creates credit risk. If Exxon were to fail on their obligations, good on those obligations on their behalf. There was a large amount of exposure, and with that. &gt;&gt; And that risk is a big drain on a bank. &gt;&gt; Every time a bank makes a loan, under banking certain reserves of capital for the loan. So JP Morgan, when they made the loan to Exxon, &gt;&gt; JP Morgan has to hold a certain capital the loan is not paid off at 100 percent as Well, of course, if you don't have to do that to do that. &gt;&gt; Because then you can finance more freely? You can take on more debt? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So Masters started looking at who could capital. She found a taker in London, the European EBRD. &gt;&gt; EBRD would receive compensation from JP and felt that that was a good risk/reward And so risk was essentially dispersed. And why did JP Morgan do that? Because we wanted to free up our capacity &gt;&gt; This was a major financial innovation. Credit derivatives made it possible for a &gt;&gt; And that's what actually happened, is the less. And so banks became able to create more and They could make more loans. &gt;&gt; The Exxon deal was just the beginning, and capital freed up. JP Morgan had struck gold. In 1998, they decided to ramp up their credit That year, another young banker joined the &gt;&gt; Part of my job was to come in as a trader including all the risk management around the That was what I was brought in to do. &gt;&gt; Previously JP Morgan had written credit Duhon was asked to write swaps on bundles &gt;&gt; The idea was, &quot;Let's put together a portfolio &gt;&gt; Her first trade was a credit default swap &gt;&gt; And that list of 306 entities, they were They had very low credit risk. &gt;&gt; And the credit default swap was ensuring &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; --many of them Fortune 500 companies or &gt;&gt; It would have been-- it would have been names. And so we were giving investors an opportunity &gt;&gt; JP Morgan did a lot of work, did a lot of loans. And you can get it in one easy bite-sized &gt;&gt; And the bank facilitated this by slicing or tranches. Investors could choose how much risk they &gt;&gt; Different investors wanted different levels There were some investors that wanted to earn were some investors that wanted to earn a all. &gt;&gt; From there, the bank looked to expand their &gt;&gt; So along comes this idea. What if we could create a market where people of the companies themselves, the risk associated &gt;&gt; And so they began selling derivatives whether the bank owned them or not. These products came to be known as synthetic CDOs. &gt;&gt; There were investors who were able to invest to before. &gt;&gt; By buying a credit default swap. &gt;&gt; By investing in a credit default swap because had access to. So there was a lot of-- a lot of very positive And it just grew. It grew very naturally. Once the seed was planted, there wasn't any &gt;&gt; It was the beginning of an unfettered brave &gt;&gt; This was pretty new stuff. &gt;&gt; This was-- [laughs] This was incredibly It was amazing. It was clearly a product that was in need. We had identified a need. &gt;&gt; Most of the members of the global derivatives Masters and Duhon. But with the creation of the credit default &gt;&gt; What in the long run this all meant was lifeblood of any economy, the global economy, And the thinking was that that would be an Credit helps drive growth, helps companies It wasn't any longer just an idea in a room marketplace. &gt;&gt; Risk could now be easily traded. It fueled a worldwide credit boom. Soon other banks got excited about the money Paul LeBlanc was a derivative salesman at to get more deals done. &gt;&gt; The volume of transactions was just exploding. I mean, I used to know all the statistics how this is a growing market and you have They can make money. We can make money. It was a massively important sector for us &gt;&gt; And importantly, it was a private market, &gt;&gt; --the Dow up just about two and three &gt;&gt; See, unlike an exchange-traded market where no public market for these derivatives. You can't look in the newspaper and get a These are all private off-exchange markets. And nobody else in the market knows what's &gt;&gt; And because this market was opaque, the could charge for derivatives and what it cost &gt;&gt; How much were these things making for the &gt;&gt; The spreads on derivatives are several just as a general rule. And that's why the banks trade them. &gt;&gt; Cash securities being those that are-- &gt;&gt; Well, paint some picture of that and the &gt;&gt; The best reference that you could give a bank might earn doing an IPO for FaceBook, out that IPO, a very hot IPO. If you were doing the same size deal in a the fee. &gt;&gt; And the basic business that they created But there's a problem with all of this. Most people in finance assume risk can be it around from one party to another party. &gt;&gt; There was growing concern in Washington. &gt;&gt; We are moving towards greater risk. We must do something to address the regulation in this country, $33 trillion, a substantial in this country, a substantial amount being That kind of risk overhanging the financial a thud, will wake everyone up. &gt;&gt; Proposals circulated to rein in the banks &gt;&gt; What are you trying to protect? &gt;&gt; We're trying to protect the money of the markets. &gt;&gt; The head of the Commodity Futures Trading &gt;&gt; Certainly, we are the regulator which has derivatives markets-- what she said is if you don't have transparency going to build up and they're going to lead massive taxpayer bailouts. &gt;&gt; The banks lobbied hard for no derivative &gt;&gt; The banks didn't want anyone to know how They didn't want to have to quantify it on They wanted to be able to push it off and And that was why they lobbied so hard to make differently from other kinds of financial &gt;&gt; Others wanted them to be regulated like &gt;&gt; One of the most heavily regulated products all the obvious reasons. If you're going to-- if you're going to write pay off that insurance. &gt;&gt; But if you write a credit default swap, money on hand. &gt;&gt; Or anything else, including, importantly, &gt;&gt; So you're saying it's a kind of under-the-table &gt;&gt; It's an insurance product designed not designed to avoid regulation at all. And one thing we do know is that when a product capital and activity moves into that area &gt;&gt; Regulation of derivatives transactions is unnecessary. &gt;&gt; The chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, &gt;&gt; Alan Greenspan was coming from a very libertarian Keep your hands off everything. The markets will sort themselves out. And if there's a problem, then we'll clean And now that-- that really was the way the leadership for almost 20 years. &gt;&gt; On Capitol Hill, supporters of bank deregulation &gt;&gt; The future of America's dominance as the &gt;&gt; Before them was legislation to lift restrictions &gt;&gt; If we didn't pass this bill, we could find financial capital of the world. &gt;&gt; This bill is going to make America more important. &gt;&gt; And legislation to prevent oversight of &gt;&gt; --high-paying jobs not just on Wall Street in America and it benefits every consumer And we do it by repealing Glass-Steagall. &gt;&gt; It's the most important example of our possibilities of the new information age global &gt;&gt; In the end, banks would get larger and &gt;&gt; The derivatives market went into darkness, And what you see is this explosion in the and throughout the world. &gt;&gt; The banks had won the day. Credit default swaps would now be introduced &gt;&gt; The next application of this same technology and in particular. mortgage-related credit risk. &gt;&gt; And the higher the risk, the better. &gt;&gt; What everyone is trying to create is something That's the holy grail, that's the goal, is you come out with a AAA, and a big return. &gt;&gt; And so Wall Street discovered the rewards Just as they had bundled corporate loans, &gt;&gt; You would buy these big pools of mortgages, to bundle all this stuff together, bring it through the sausage-making machine and create &gt;&gt; Bankers spread their investing dollars seeing historic levels of population growth, here, in Georgia. &gt;&gt; Well, Atlanta was one of the hottest markets &gt;&gt; Roy Barnes is the former governor of Georgia. &gt;&gt; Georgia was the fourth fastest growing the fastest growing state east of the Mississippi. So it was a hot market to start with. &gt;&gt; Elected in 1998, Barnes is renowned for lending, a market the &gt;&gt; And in the '80s, there was no place for Nobody wanted it. The banks wouldn't buy it because there was &gt;&gt; What really changed the appetite for subprime And you could sell it on Wall Street. They do it in tranches, and then they wrap have an overall higher yield. &gt;&gt; Nearly half of all new single-family home 50,000 a month. &gt;&gt; And of course, Moody's says AAA. So it was just a feeding frenzy. I mean, it was just an absolute feeding frenzy &gt;&gt; With the economy strong, home buyers are did just two decades ago. &gt;&gt; And you could just about drive by a bank, as you passed by. It became very loose. Became very loose. &gt;&gt; But what big banks on Wall Street did not the ground around the U.S., a wave of lending &gt;&gt; The Wild West experience in home mortgages &gt;&gt; Forty one year old Hessiemay Hector, mother percent. &gt;&gt; We were creating mortgages that we had And they were being created faster and faster. &gt;&gt; The interest rate on these loans was as &gt;&gt; We saw borrowers given loans that were Home buyers were getting loans that had no &gt;&gt; When you have a high interest rate, then Then you have pre-payment penalties, when mortgages and when you layer those bad practices predatory. &gt;&gt; Housing advocates around the country took But one of the fiercest fights was here in Fair Lending Act. &gt;&gt; It's up right now on the House floor, a &gt;&gt; The mortgage lenders and the banks struck &gt;&gt; None of these people have a clue of what's Nobody here understands the business, and &gt;&gt; You would have thought I had recommended Why were they so opposed to it? Money. Money. It's going to cripple real estate sales! It's going to absolutely devastate the home &gt;&gt; There were threats that the residents in anymore because investors would not buy the And if that were true, no bank would create &gt;&gt; Georgia now has the toughest predatory &gt;&gt; Despite the efforts of the mortgage lobby, Fearing similar bills in other states, the the law. &gt;&gt; Right after the Governor Barnes's defeat for the new governor and the new legislature I think it was about two weeks into the new &gt;&gt; No let-up in the housing boom, which is Homes were selling last month at a record &gt;&gt; The big banks continued to package and And more and more of these CDOs contained To keep the rating agencies on board, more &gt;&gt; Let's say I have a pool of mortgages. I have a thousand mortgages from California, But I decide, &quot;Well, some of these mortgages bit of credit default insurance.&quot; &gt;&gt; And by doing that, you improve the profile- &gt;&gt; --of your CDO- &gt;&gt; --so that you can sell it better. &gt;&gt; And I can go get a rating for it, too. I could go to Moody's and say, &quot;Look, I have Shouldn't I get a better rating than if I &gt;&gt; So you take a lot of crap- &gt;&gt; --a lot of mortgages that are- &gt;&gt; --people are not going to pay-- right. OK. But you insure it, and the credit agency says, &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; New home sales jumped 13 percent over a percent, setting a new record-- in mortgage debt, but they weren't sure it &gt;&gt; We traded mortgages. We had some mortgages on our books. We certainly understood the mortgage-backed But we had a lot of trouble getting comfortable The big hang-up for us was data. We had years and years of historical data cycles. But we didn't have that much data about how business cycles. &gt;&gt; We knew how much money people said they We saw that UBS and Merrill Lynch had securitized than ours. And we asked ourselves the question, &quot;What What are we missing? Have we not figured out how to lay off some And honestly, we couldn't figure it out. What we never imagined was that those other They were just taking the risk and sitting &gt;&gt; Sales of new single family homes shot up-- had developed these original ideas in the happen -- essentially, other banks were taking they had never expected -- some of them began &gt;&gt; We were just about to say done on a transaction. We had a global phone call, and we were discussing had discussed it over and over and over. And finally, someone on that phone call said, &gt;&gt; Twice as many home buyers are getting adjustable &gt;&gt; --a huge increase in new home sales-- reassessing the risk as we went along. And suddenly, we found ourselves with a product And every little tweak along the way, we had That's OK. That's OK,&quot; until suddenly, we all looked &gt;&gt; The world is still living with a lot of &gt;&gt; Other banks were not so cautious. &gt;&gt; --storm clouds on the horizon-- customers all over the world. London became a second beachhead for their &gt;&gt; The stock market's on the rise and economic &gt;&gt; The City of London actually did yeomen's They did this offshore. These were not SEC-registered deals. These were all private placements. So they were going through the legal loopholes. &gt;&gt; A group of state-run banks in Germany known Desiree Fixler, who worked at JP Morgan, says subprime mortgages. &gt;&gt; You knew that a core group of banks in We strongly believed they were very naive. We were amazed that they would buy this. It was-- I mean, every single person, every sales person that was able to cover the Landesbanks seats globally. You were going to generate tremendous profit They were big buyers. &gt;&gt; IKB was very convinced that they were one They were running around, telling people how &gt;&gt; Multinational Deutsche Bank did several &gt;&gt; Did you think, at the time, that your products for them to buy? &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. Otherwise, we wouldn't have manufactured these &gt;&gt; So you were bullish on subprime mortgages &gt;&gt; We were bullish on the mortgage market of it, we were not overly aggressive, but Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Americans are buying real estate in record That demand has given-- value of credit default swaps around the world doubling every year. &gt;&gt; Existing home sales rose 4.5 percent, setting &gt;&gt; Did top management at JP Morgan understand &gt;&gt; Yes, they did. Absolutely, they did. &gt;&gt; Did they at other banks? &gt;&gt; No, not all other banks. Certainly not. &gt;&gt; Did the regulators understand them? &gt;&gt; I don't think the regulators understood. I don't think the credit ratings agencies, all of the kinds of credit instruments that &gt;&gt; In other words, some big banks simply didn't &gt;&gt; Certainly, they didn't-- they didn't know That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Sales were higher than most regions, up &gt;&gt; Housing prices continued to soar. &gt;&gt; The average price of a new home grew slightly-- Theoretically, there was no limit. An investor didn't need to own any actual So-called synthetic CDOs allowed investors of debt. or selling, so on either side of the market constrained by the size of the underlying &gt;&gt; In synthetic CDOs, all you had to do was to this group of mortgages and have that be The fact that someone had done it one time again and again. &gt;&gt; So how is that different than betting on &gt;&gt; Or a horse race or a craps table. There's no different at all. It's just a pure bet by somebody who has no on. &gt;&gt; We're pretty confident that the housing It's just going to go up. &gt;&gt; Within a decade, you have the most phenomenal &gt;&gt; New homes are selling at the second highest &gt;&gt; We are in a housing boom. It's strong right now. &gt;&gt; Profits soared 93 percent. &gt;&gt; --expected to dole out $36 million in &gt;&gt; Everyone was high-fiving. It seemed to be brilliant. The combination of free markets, innovation this incredibly heady cocktail of tremendous &gt;&gt; Top executives will earn as much as $20 &gt;&gt; Between 2003 and 2006, Dick Kovacevich, with bankers and regulators. &gt;&gt; Oftentimes, what would happen at these like Chairman Bernanke, and there might be, And they would often go around the room and You know, &quot;What's working? Are you concerned about housing,&quot; you know, And when they came to me, I would say, &quot;This We're building a bubble. We're not going to like the outcome. &gt;&gt; What did your fellow bankers say to you was toxic? &gt;&gt; Well, the ones that were in it said I was &quot;We don't see any losses occurring in this.&quot; &gt;&gt; But we saw risk all over the place. &gt;&gt; There's a great set of adages on Wall Street And if you ask people, they're basically split One says that risk will flow to the smartest And the other says that risk will flow to it. And at least based on my experience and my the derivatives market, it's the latter. &gt;&gt; I was amazed at the interest on the part highly complex and very risky on top of it. &gt;&gt; So let me get this straight. You were-- you were first to the party. You developed this tranching of stuff-- &gt;&gt; --and writing credit default swaps on But now everybody else has jumped into the &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to do it. &gt;&gt; But your team decided to stop. Why did so many others keep going, marching &gt;&gt; The-- I mean, there-- I-- look, very some banks, some borrowers who are a bit greedier &gt;&gt; Goldman Sachs Lloyd Blankfein will take &gt;&gt; No one wanted the party to end. &gt;&gt; --pocket an estimated $40 million-- never go down, let alone crash. &gt;&gt; To imagine losses of that severity required of the economy which were just not in people's So it required things like assuming that house People weren't thinking that way. And as long as house prices never fell, then And that ultimately was obviously very flawed &gt;&gt; As interest rates rose early this year, And after years of record appreciation-- and the cost of borrowing is going up. &gt;&gt; The unraveling began in late 2006. &gt;&gt; Big trouble for millions of American home &gt;&gt; When housing prices started to drop, only were trapped in. &gt;&gt; The housing market has turned some mortgages &gt;&gt; By 2007, 2008, all the smart money knew to effectively repackage what they were stuck their books. But there was second parallel movement which we take advantage of it?&quot; &gt;&gt; The Dow-Jones average seemed in freefall, &gt;&gt; One of the Wall Street banks that took Sachs. According to a congressional investigation, toxic subprime and then sold them to customers-- by our ability to get things done on behalf &gt;&gt; --while Goldman Sachs, using credit default &gt;&gt; They bet against their own clients, so money. Goldman has a little slogan that the clients No, they didn't. Not in these transactions. Goldman came first, second and third. They were really, I think, the only major burst. &gt;&gt; In a settlement with the SEC, Goldman admitted not disclose important information, but Goldman institutions. &gt;&gt; Thirty-four subprime mortgage companies &gt;&gt; One customer was that German Landesbank, &gt;&gt; Analysts say anyone associated with the &gt;&gt; Even when there was a downturn in the markets, I mean, the market is telling them. It's on the screen. There are headlines everywhere, &quot;Danger.&quot; But they still wanted to go ahead. &gt;&gt; Did you feel there was an obligation on the markets are going down. Maybe you should stop buying this crap?&quot; &gt;&gt; Those discussions-- the word &quot;crap&quot; wasn't happened. But they felt that this was just a temporary &quot;It will recover. It has to recover.&quot; &gt;&gt; In July 2007, the German bank, IKB, stuffed &gt;&gt; --hundreds of thousands of home owners &gt;&gt; It was only a matter of time before the &gt;&gt; --and that could hurt the value of homes &gt;&gt; We knew that the housing bubble had burst. But we'd been reassured that the problem had But by the beginning of 2008, it was becoming than anybody anticipated. &gt;&gt; There was a broad misperception of the The widespread view that we could have a regional decline in housing prices, proved to be horribly &gt;&gt; Last week was a difficult time in the mortgage There was talk about problems in funds-- by far-- what they could. But there was confusion. At CitiGroup, they were running in circles. &gt;&gt; One of the incredible things about CitiGroup, risks off its balance sheet, those risks came Without knowing it, they had set up one business that business, taking those risks back onto &gt;&gt; It was quite clear to me that a number had not had the kind of management information all their risks were. &gt;&gt; That was astounding to you. &gt;&gt; It was astounding to me. &gt;&gt; The sort of origination of these subprime is gone. &gt;&gt; And the reason why is all those credit &gt;&gt; It would all come down to those credit Would they pay off as they were designed to &gt;&gt; We have known for generations that banks Banks can't function if everybody comes and &gt;&gt; --Merrill Lynch, devastated by losses-- fire sale of Merrill lynch-- The world's largest insurance company-- company. AIG was on the hook for $440 billion worth &gt;&gt; --credit default swaps-- as good as the credit quality of the insurer. They have to pay you. And if they can't pay you for whatever reason, down. &gt;&gt; We need to stabilize this industry. It can spread throughout the economy. It could be a very, very dangerous-- of my CEOs, and CEOs traditionally don't read But I kept looking around and noticing that And so I turned to one. We recessed. And I said, &quot;You looked like the world was And he said, &quot;I think it has.&quot; &gt;&gt; --the enormity of the situation, like Some $400-odd billion of credit default swaps-- an $85 billion-- all of those credit derivatives because it what we'd call a balanced book or nearly enough &gt;&gt; Didn't everybody know that AIG was holding &gt;&gt; No. There was no disclosure. That's the whole point They haven't reported The other dealers have no idea what's going The other banks don't know. Nobody knows. The banks turned this market into their own &gt;&gt; It was, in fact, a financial shell game by moving the risk out through one door, but another door. The risk was not leaving the banking system, these chains of risk. And if any part of that chain breaks down entire system implodes. &gt;&gt; The idea dreamed up by a group of young years ago was supposed to reduce risk. &gt;&gt; Their original idea had been taken and they never dreamt would become so big and &gt;&gt; It was a very scary time. We were in totally new territory. And the notion that Lehman Brothers could at risk of the same fate was absolutely unprecedented. And the implications-- thinking through the of the U.S. economy but the world were-- to do that. I couldn't get my mind around it. I know others couldn't. &gt;&gt; We never saw it coming. We never saw that coming. And I was disappointed, hugely disappointed. I mean, I was part of a market that I believed And maybe I was idealistic, maybe I was young, we were going, but there was a whole system way from the borrower of the mortgage, all There's a whole system of people who maybe know, just-- I don't know. It's-- it's frustrating to see, certainly. &gt;&gt; It shouldn't have happened. Most of our financial crisis in the past is disruption, war. This was caused by a few institutions, about relative to managing their risk. And the sad thing is it should never have The management should have stopped it before And people are suffering for something that &gt;&gt; Today, the fallout is felt mostly in places Ground zero of the subprime crisis-- local &gt;&gt; Cities throughout the United States are And that's where the neighbors feel it. As neighbors, we're concerned not so much market and derivatives. These things we will hardly ever understand. What we feel on the street is the fact that partially burned. And we wonder how long it's going to be there, A neighborhood cannot survive long when it properties. &gt;&gt; Sometimes, no one even knows who owns the &gt;&gt; It's hard to know who owns it because it's that it could be somebody in Ireland who owns You have these securitized pools, where investors The investors are around the world, literally, It's a vacant property, mostly vandalized, with it. And the reality is that that plays out across &gt;&gt; That house has a loan that put together by some young Turks on Wall Street. It's lost in that billion-dollar package because And there are whole subdivisions like this, the way, that are just lost in this great And so it affects Main Street because Wall The greed of Wall Street broke Main Street.
