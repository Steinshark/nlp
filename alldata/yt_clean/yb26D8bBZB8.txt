IT'S ABOUT AS FAR [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, LET'S HEAD THE THEME OF TONIGHT IS COUPLED WITH WHAT IT'S LIKE AND THIS IS KIND OF YEAH, LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THAT MY FATHER WAS CLASSICALLY TRAINED AND HE TRAVELED THE WORLD AND HE MET MY MOTHER AND AFTER THE WAR -- INDONESIA USED TO BE AND AFTER THE WAR, EITHER REMAIN UNDER THEIR RULE AND THEY OPTED WHERE LIFE BECAME BECAUSE MY MOM BECAME BECAUSE SO, HERE SHE IS, STUCK AT HOME WITH TWO RUGRATS, AND MY FATHER'S OUT WHICH KEPT HIM FROM HOME EVENTUALLY, YOU KNOW, AND EVERYTHING COMING IN ORDER TO MAKE MONEY HE JOINED THE AIR FORCE AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE, HE SAID TO MY MOM, &quot;LET'S PACK UP THE KIDS AND MOVE TO BEVERLY.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] EXCEPT IT WASN'T BEVERLY HILLS, WE CAME TO AMERICA NINE DAYS ON A BOAT. AND HE PERFORMED ON THE BOAT AND THAT WAS OUR TICKET AND ONE DAY, HE COMES UP TO ALEX &quot;WHY DON'T YOU GUYS PLAY PIANO SO, WE ENDED UP PERFORMING WHICH SHOWED US THE QUIRKS OR THE PLUSSES OF IT, WE'RE AT THE CAPTAIN'S TABLE [ LAUGHTER ] SO, WE FOUND OUT WHAT BEING ON STAGE MEANT, BUT ANYWAY, SO WHEN WE FINALLY ARRIVED IT WAS ROUGH. MY FATHER, YOU KNOW, HAD TO WALK THREE MILES HE WAS A JANITOR AND PACIFIC TELEPHONE. MY MOM WAS A MAID. AND THERE WAS ALWAYS IN OUR FAMILY EVER SINCE WE WERE YOUNG YOU KNOW, SOMEWHERE, THAT WE WERE GONNA FOLLOW AND KNOWING THAT SHE INSISTED THAT WE START BEING ALREADY IN HOLLAND. THAT'S WHY WE BROUGHT THE PIANO BUT ANYWAY, AND MY MOM BEING A MAID THE THING JUST CUT OUT. IT'S BACK. AND HE DIDN'T KNOW AND, YOU KNOW, BUT THEY WEREN'T BUT SLOWLY, HE STARTED MEETING ALSO, YOU KNOW, AND HE STARTED GIGGING BECAUSE BEING A JANITOR IT DIDN'T PAY THE RENT, AND WE LIVED IN ONE ROOM. WE SLEPT IN ONE BED IN A HOUSE SO, IT WAS ROUGH GOING. SO, THE ONLY THING, AGAIN, WAS MY DAD GIGGING AS WE GREW ALEX STARTED PLAYING DRUMS AND I'LL NEVER FORGET. 'CAUSE HE HAD LONG HAIR, HE HAD TO TAKE A WHOLE JAR WHAT WAS THAT STUFF CALLED, AND JUST SLICK HIS HAIR BACK, TOOK HIM DAYS AND THEN EVENTUALLY, I ENDED UP PLAYING BASS AND I DIDN'T KNOW MY &quot;A&quot; BUT THESE, YOU KNOW, WE WERE PLAYING, EVERYTHING FROM OOMPAH MUSIC TO, YOU KNOW, WEDDINGS, AND AL WOULD YELL TO ME YOU KNOW, HE'D GO, NO, YOU FUCKED IT UP.&quot; [ LAUGHTER ] BUT -- DOES HE STILL DO THAT?

WE WERE BORN IN HOLLAND, WE USED TO STOMP AROUND WITH POTS AND PANS AND, YOU KNOW, LISTENING TO BIG BAND AND WE ALWAYS EVERYTHING HAD TO BE LOUD, BUT AS WE GOT OLDER, WE CONTINUED TO TAKE AND MY MOM HAD PUT US THESE ANNUAL CONTESTS WHERE YOU PRACTICE ONE PIECE I'M GOING WAY OFF NO, THIS IS FASCINATING. ANYWAY, YOU PRACTICE AND THE FUNNY THING IS I NEVER LEARNED AND I FOOLED I WAS JUST BLESSED I'D WATCH HIS FINGERS AND HE DIDN'T FIND OUT THAT I COULDN'T READ. HE ACTUALLY FOUND OUT WHEN HE WAS PLAYING AND HE ASKED ME AND I'M SITTING GOING... [ LAUGHTER ] HE GOES, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TURN I'M GOING, HE'S GOING, &quot;WHAT?&quot; YOU KNOW, THIS IS AFTER WITH THE GUY, AND HE FINALLY FOUND OUT, WHICH HE WASN'T BUT THE FUNNY THING IS -- OKAY, THESE PIANO CONTESTS YOU'RE NOT EVEN ALLOWED YOU CAN'T USE SO IT WAS ACTUALLY TO NOT BE ABLE TO READ. I COULD NOT LOOK UP I HAD TO SEE BUT THESE PIANO CONTESTS, ACTUALLY, BOTH ALEX AND I WON I THINK I WON FIRST PRIZE AND AL WON FIRST PRIZE, BUT WE ALWAYS WON, AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE IN PHASES AND THEN YOU WAIT AN HOUR TO SEE IF YOUR NAME I HAD NO IDEA. THEN IT WOULD GO DOWN AND YOU'D SEE IF YOUR NAME AND IT WOULD GO DOWN AND THEN 10 AND THEN 5, ALEX AND I ARE BOTH GOING, WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT,&quot; AND MY DAD WAS ALWAYS THE ONE WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. AND, WELL, THERE IT WAS. AND THEN WE ENDED UP WINNING, BUT THAT WAS SO THAT WAS 9, 10, 11 YEARS OLD AND THEN WE DISCOVERED AND OF COURSE, LIKE ANY KID, AND I QUIT PIANO LESSONS AND CONTEST CIRCUITS, AND SAID, &quot;I WANT TO GET MYSELF 'CAUSE I LIKED THE SONG [ IMITATES DRUMS ] ...BY DAVE CLARK FIVE.

GEORGE DRUM KIT AND MY MOM TO STILL DO SOMETHING WHICH WAS TAKE NOW, FORGIVE ME IS DIFFERENT FROM YOURS, BUT ALL I REMEMBER IS ME GOING OUT AND COMING HOME, AND I'M GOING, &quot;OKAY.&quot; YOU KNOW, P.O.'d ME A BIT AND THEN FINALLY, &quot;OKAY, HE'S JUST BETTER SO, I NEVER WANTED TO PLAY &quot;OKAY, GO AHEAD, I'LL PLAY [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE FUNNY THING IS YOU PROBABLY SAY OR THE SAME THING, AND THAT IS THAT WAS LIKE HE WASN'T JUST HE WAS MAKING MUSIC IT JUST CAME WHEREAS THE GUITAR WAS JUST AND WE'RE BOTH RIGHT. YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, IT WAS DESTINY. IT DOES SEEM LIKE OF SHAKING OUT THE WAY NOW, YOU DIDN'T TAKE IN THE SAME WAY NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. I, INSTEAD OF READING A BOOK, I'D SAY THAT 90% OF THE THINGS IF I HAD TAKEN LESSONS I WOULD NOT PLAY AT ALL AS A MATTER OF FACT, BECAUSE OF THE THINGS AND WHATEVER THEY HAD TO REINVENT 'CAUSE THEY COULD NOT EXPLAIN WHAT I WAS DOING SO THEY HAD TO CREATE A WHOLE WITH SYMBOLS YEAH, AND WHAT FINGER'S WHERE AND THE FUNNY THING IS, NOW THEY COME UP WITH AND I CAN'T MAKE SENSE SO I DON'T HAVE A CLUE [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, CAN WE FLASH BACK THAT'S WHEN VAN HALEN'S HIT THE STORES, AND IT REALLY KIND OF TURNED DO YOU GUYS AGREE?

'CAUSE DON'T FORGET, BEING A ROCK 'N' ROLL BAND IT'S KIND OF EXCEPT BACK THEN, THAT WAS, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO ROCK 'N' ROLL SO, FOR US TO SUCCEED AMONGST OR IN THE MIDDLE AND ANYWAY, LET ME START BY SAYING I GUESS WHAT DRIVES ME IS SOME OF IT IS NECESSITY, AND SOME OF IT 'CAUSE I'M ALWAYS PUSHING THINGS I HATE TO BRING UP BUT, YOU KNOW, WHILE THEY'RE I WAS ALREADY GOING TO 15, I WAS WAY PAST THAT. BUT SO ANYWAY, WHAT I REALLY WAS THE VIBRATO BAR, EXCEPT THEY ONLY CAME WHICH AT HIGH VOLUME, THEY SQUEAL UNLESS YOU USE SOME KIND OF WHICH I COULD NOT AFFORD, AND THERE'S THAT MADE A LES PAUL -- LES PAUL WAS A DEAR FRIEND WHICH MADE HUMBUCKING PICKUPS, THEY CANCELED THE HUM, SO, I PROCEEDED TO FIND THAT MADE KNOCKOFF BODIES A COMPANY CALLED AND I WENT OUT THERE AND SAID, HE GOES, &quot;OH, YOU DON'T WANT I GO, &quot;WHY NOT?&quot; THE GUY GOES, I THOUGHT HE MEANT YOU KNOW, WHAT HE MEANT WAS &quot;WE CAN'T SELL THOSE AND, YOU KNOW, I SAID, [ LAUGHTER ] SO, I BOUGHT A $50 BODY AND I PROCEEDED TO TAKE AND MAKE A HOLE BIG ENOUGH FOR A GIBSON PICKUP AND OF COURSE, THAT PICKUP HAD TO COME OUT SO I RUINED THAT GUITAR BUT I KNEW SO, I SCREWED THE PICKUP AND A STRATOCASTER SO I ROUTED OUT THE BODY AND CRAMMED AND MIND YOU, EVERYTHING WAS UNSOLDERED IT HAD THREE KNOBS AND I HAVE ONE PICKUP THAT &quot;OKAY, NOW HOW AM I GONNA I HAD NO CLUE SO I WONDERED IF I JUST HOOKED STRAIGHT UP THE ONE KNOB, SO I JUST RIPPED EVERYTHING OUT, AND MADE MY OWN PICK GUARD AND THAT'S WHAT ENDED UP WITH ALL WAS THERE EVER ANYTHING LIKE, DO YOU HAVE FULL OF YES. [ LAUGHTER ] YES. I'VE DESTROYED MANY TAKING JUST CHOICE PIECES OUT SO THEN FINALLY, OKAY, AND I GUESS ONE OF THE WHAT PROMPTED THAT I HAVE NO ANSWER FOR WITH A BLANK PIECE OF WOOD AND IT SOUNDED GREAT AND I PAINTED IT BLACK, AND I'M GOING, THERE'S SOME TAPE LAYING THERE, TAKE A RAZOR BLADE AND SPRAY PAINTED IT WHITE AND I'M GOING, IT WAS REALLY THERE WAS NO &quot;I HAVE TO MAKE [ LAUGHTER ] EVEN THOUGH AND THEN LATER ON, IS THE SAME GUITAR I TAPED OVER IT AGAIN BUT -- AND THAT LED KIND OF COPYING, YOU KNOW, IT BECAME STANDARD ALL OF A SUDDEN, I MEAN, A HUMBUCKING BUT THERE'S SO MANY OTHER THINGS LIKE POTTING THE PICKUP, IF YOU GET UNWANTED LIKE IF YOU EVER WATCH AND YOU GET THIS REAL ANNOYING I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE GOOD KIND OF FEEDBACK I'M TALKING ABOUT NOW, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT BUT I WAS THINKING, VERY THIN COPPER WIRE AROUND THESE PLASTIC THINGS AND I'M GOING, &quot;MAYBE IT'S THE LITTLE SO, I PROCEEDED TO EMPTY ONE AND WENT TO THE STORE AND GOT A HOT PLATE, AND AGAIN, PROCEEDED TO RUIN 'CAUSE I FORGOT YOU KNOW, THAT YOU SEE THERE, AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SO I MELTED AND THEN I FIGURED, &quot;OKAY, AND AS SOON AS I SEE I'M GONNA YANK IT OUT.&quot; AND IT WORKED. AND PEOPLE STILL USE THAT BECAME A STANDARD EVERY COMPANY DOES THAT. IT'S LIKE ALL THIS STUFF THAT COMES OUT OF OR IS GIVEN TO ME I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, SAY THE CROSSING WAS A CONSCIOUS, 'CAUSE THERE WAS NO GUITAR THAT DID WHAT I WANTED. SO, THAT WAS A NECESSITY. THE PAINT JOB POTTING A PICKUP, I HAVE NO IDEA SO, THEN I HAD A GUITAR, AND I USED TO WORK DELIVERING PIANOS AND ONE DAY, I'VE ONLY SEEN PICTURES ONLY ERIC CLAPTON, NOT KIDS ON THE STREET. AND I SAID, SO, I WORKED ALL SUMMER AND WE WERE ALREADY TOO LOUD, I'M SURE YOUR NEIGHBORS NOW I HAVE A 100-WATT MARSHALL THAT I DID EVERYTHING TO LEAVE IT FACEDOWN, AND WE'D BE AUDITIONING AND, &quot;NO, YOUR GUITARS TOO LOUD, AND TOO MUCH AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, ALL THIS STUFF BECAUSE I SAW AN AD IN THE PAPER I'M GOING, &quot;WELL, MAYBE WELL, IT CERTAINLY WAS, 'CAUSE WHEN IT SHOWED UP IT DIDN'T WORK. BUT I LEFT IT ON, OKAY? WHAT I DIDN'T REALIZE WAS AND IT WAS 220 VOLTS. SO I PLUGGED IT INTO THE WALL, I DIDN'T BOTHER TO LOOK BUT IT WAS SET ON 220. SO IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR IT AND WHEN I PICKED UP MY GUITAR, &quot;IT SOUNDS INCREDIBLE,&quot; IT WAS SO QUIET THAT ONLY MY DOG AND I [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN IT DAWNED ON ME. I'M GOING, &quot;WAIT A MINUTE. &quot;I CAN CONTROL THE LEVEL SO I PROCEEDED TO THE LIGHT DIMMER BLEW THE POWER OUT, SO FINALLY, I WENT TO THIS PLACE IN PASADENA AND ASKED, ANY KIND OF INDUSTRIAL LIKE A HUGE LIGHT DIMMER,&quot; AND YEAH. HE GOES, &quot;YEAH, WE GOT AND I SAID, &quot;OKAY, COOL.&quot; SO, I TAKE IT HOME AND I WOULD LOWER THE VOLTAGE THE LOWEST I EVER WENT DEPENDING ON THE SIZE ROOM I'D SET IT AND THAT BECAME -- BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY WAS WITH EVERYTHING AND IF IT WAS RUNNING IT WAS JUST SO DAMN LOUD, SO THAT BECAME MY VOLUME KNOB, WHEN WE USED TO PLAY GAZZARRI'S, IF WE PLAYED SOMEWHERE I'D CRANK IT TO 80. AND FOR RECORDING, THE SWEET SPOT THERE SEEMS TO BE, THOUGH, AND THAT YOU KNOW, WHAT IS BEYOND MORE POWER, YES. [ LAUGHTER ] MORE IS ALWAYS BETTER, [ LAUGHS ] IT'S LIKE -- WHAT'S THE OLD IF IT'S ALL YOU CAN EAT GIVE ME THREE BUCKS' WORTH. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT'S -- TO ME, IT'S JUST I'M ALWAYS TINKERING THE MAIN THING I ALWAYS ASK YOU KNOW? &quot;I WONDER WHAT'LL HAPPEN AND A LOT OF TIMES, AND ACCIDENTALLY HIT A CAPACITOR YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, KICKED YOU BUT, YOU KNOW, I CONTINUED IT ALSO GOES WITH BECAUSE YOU'RE KNOWN WITH BOTH YOUR RIGHT HAND ON THE FRETBOARD.

SO, LIKE RIGHT NOW, [ TAPPING NOTES ] ...YOU CAN'T TELL THIS HAND OR THAT HAND. YOU TELL ME, [ TAPPING NOTES ] I USE THEM BOTH, OKAY? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NO, SO MY POINT BEING IS OR THESE TWO, IS JUST AN EXTENSION SO, IF I'M PLAYING AN &quot;A&quot;... [ GUITAR PLAYING ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEN, YOU KNOW, THEN I STARTED ACTUALLY MAKING YOU KNOW, LIKE &quot;ERUPTION.&quot; [ &quot;ERUPTION&quot; PLAYS ] SO, THAT'S -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO, THAT'S THE TAPPING OR THE -- I DON'T EVEN KNOW I DIDN'T CALL IT ANYTHING.
