THAT REPORT IS SENDING SHARES LOWER AHEAD OF ITS EARNINGS ON WEDNESDAY. A STOCK IS DOWN 3%. MANDEEP SINGH JOINS US NOW FOR MORE. LET'S GET TO WEDNESDAY WHEN WE GET THE EARNINGS FROM NVIDIA AFTER THE CLOSING BELL. WHAT IS TOP OF MIND FOR YOU? MANDEEP: EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE HEARD SO FAR THIS EARNINGS SEASON FROM HYPER SCALARS THAT BEEN VERY CONSTRUCTIVE IN TERMS OF RAISING THE CAPEX MODELS, SPENDING STILL HOLDING UP, SO THAT SHOULD TRANSLATE INTO SIGNIFICANT FEED IN RATES FOR NVIDIA AS WE HAVE SEEN THE PAST SIX QUARTERS. WITH THE CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION, I THINK IT'S A POSITIVE FOR NVIDIA IN THE SENSE THAT THEY ARE EXPOSED TO CRYPTO AND AUTONOMOUS DRIVING WITH ELON MUSK'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE ADMINISTRATION. NET-NET, WE ARE IN A MUCH BETTER SPOT WHEN IT COMES TO NVIDIA VISIBILITY NOW THAN WE WERE ALREADY DAYS BACK. HOPEFULLY THAT SHOULD TRANSLATE INTO QUITE A BIT OF A RAISE THIS QUARTER. LISA: THAT MAY BE THE CASE GOING FORWARD, BUT I WANT TO DIG IN DEEPER FROM WHERE IT COMES FROM. HOW MUCH OF IT IS FROM THE HYPER SCALARS, GOOGLE, MICROSOFT, OR DO WE NEED TO SEE THAT BROADENING OUT IN ORDER FOR NVIDIA TO KEEP ITS GAINS? MANDEEP: YOU ARE RIGHT, NVIDIA HAS A 40% LESS REVENUE EXPOSURE TO THE HYPER SCALARS. I WOULD QUOTE SUNDAR PICHAI SAYING 25% OF THE NEW CODE IS WRITTEN BY AI NOW, MARK ZUCKERBERG SAYING META LLAMA WILL BE 10 TIMES BIGGER, THE NEXT MODEL. THOSE ARE TWO VERY CONSTRUCTIVE DATA POINTS WHEN IT COMES TO THE OVERALL MARKET. THAT IS WHAT GIVES EVERYONE THE OPTIMISM AND VISIBILITY INTO 2025. STILL THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT THE 26 NUMBER BECAUSE THE COMPANIES TRAINING THEIR LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS, THE FIELD IS NARROWING. NO ONE HAS THE CAPEX THAT THESE COMPANIES HAVE. EVEN IF APPLE, TESLA ARE TWO INCREMENTAL PLAYERS, SIX OR SEVEN COMPANIES FOCUSING ON MODEL TRAINING. CONCENTRATION IS NEVER GOOD. AT THE SAME TIME, THE SCALING LAWS, AS LONG AS THEY HOLD, IT'S A BIG BOOST FOR A COMPANY LIKE NVIDIA. LISA: WHEN DO THE HYPER SCALARS REACH THE LIMIT OF HOW MUCH THEY CAN EXPAND IN THE U.S.? THERE IS A REAL QUESTION AROUND NATIONAL SECURITY AND EXPANDING SOME OF THOSE DATA CENTERS OVERSEAS WHEN THERE HAVE BEEN RESTRICTIONS ON CERTAIN AI CHIPS. ULTIMATELY THOSE DATA CENTERS AND OTHER COUNTRIES COULD BE CONSIDERED EXPORTS OF CHIPS. AT WHAT POINT DOES NOT BECOME A HEADWIND TO NVIDIA? MANDEEP: ABSOLUTELY THAT IS A CONCERN GIVEN THERE IS SO MUCH SENSITIVITY AROUND THE TRAINING OF THESE LLMS. ELON MUSK JUST SET UP A DATA CENTER IN MEMPHIS WHERE HE HAS A CLUSTER OF 100,000 GP USE. THAT WAS BUILT IN 20 DAYS. IF THE SCALING WALLS WERE TO HOLD, EVEN 100 K CLUSTER IS NOT ENOUGH. DO WE HAVE ENOUGH POWER IN THE U.S. TO SUPPLY THAT KIND OF DATA CENTER? THAT IS WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE BOTTLENECK, THE POWER ASPECT OF IT. I THINK IT IS THE SAME OUTSIDE THE U.S., AS WELL, BUT AS LONG AS WE TALK ABOUT NVIDIA BENEFITING FROM MARCH OF DEMAND, DO WE HAVE SUFFICIENT POWER TO POWER THAT KIND OF DATA CENTER NOW? THAT IS WHERE THERE IS STILL UNCERTAINTY, WHETHER WE HAVE THE POWER AVAILABILITY. JONATHAN: NVIDIA IS HUGE SO WE ALL HAVE EXPOSURE TO IT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. EXPLAIN THE STORY THIS MORNING, REPORTING THE CHIPMAKER IS FACING A DESIGN SNACK FOR THE BLACKWELL CHIPS. WE SEE THAT DROPPING IN AND OUT OF THE NEWS REPEATEDLY, SHAKING UP THE STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME. MANDEEP: YES, IT HAPPENED, I WOULD SAY TWO MONTHS BACK, THE STOCK REACTED NEGATIVELY SINCE EARNINGS, BUT IT HA BEEN UP 40% SINCE THEN. THE REASON THAT INVESTORS ARE STILL OPTIMISTIC, EVEN IF THERE ARE DELAYS, THOSE COMPANIES THAT ARE TRAINING MODELS, THERE IS NO ONE ELSE TO GO. IT IS NOT THAT INTEL IS DOING BETTER. NVIDIA IS STILL THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN. EVEN IF IT IS DELAYED BY THREE MONTHS, COMPANIES WILL WAIT FOR IT. FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, I DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE DELAYS OR THE SNAGS THAT MUCH BECAUSE NVIDIA
