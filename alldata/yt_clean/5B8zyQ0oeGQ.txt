[dramatic music] - THE AVERAGE AMERICAN - HEART DISEASE AND STROKE OF 460,000 AMERICAN WOMEN. - 69 GRAMS OF FAT. YOU COULD ACTUALLY SAVE AND HALF THE CALORIES IF YOU SIMPLY ATE - WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION - PROSTATE CANCER IS NOW IN AMERICAN MEN. - DOCTORS SAY WE REALLY NEED TO - AND ARTERIAL SCLEROSIS AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE. - WE HAVE UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AND WE'RE STARTING IN OUR CHILDREN - IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING, - CLEARLY THE WESTERN DIET THIS SHOULD SERVE WE HAVE A GROWING PROBLEM, AND THE ONES WHO ARE GROWING Narrator Lee Fulkerson: IT'S CENTRAL EVERY SPECIAL OCCASION SEEMS BUT COULD SOME INCLUDING SEVERAL THAT WE THINK ALSO BE CAUSING MANY OF OUR INDEED, WE'RE FACING NO LESS THAN 40% OF AMERICANS AND ABOUT HALF OF US ARE TAKING - THE BEST KNOWN STATIN DRUG, IS THE MOST PRESCRIBED DRUG EVER - ALMOST ONE IN FIVE AMERICAN ARE NOW CONSIDERED - THOUGH MEXICAN-AMERICANS ARE STILL MORE LIKELY - THIS COULD BE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT Fulkerson: WE SPEND $2.2 OVER FIVE TIMES MORE IN FACT, WE PAY MORE PER PERSON THAN ANY INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRY YET WE'RE SICKER THAN EVER. - YOU SEE, THERE'S NO MONEY AND THERE'S NO MONEY THE MONEY IS IN THE MIDDLE: BUT WITH ONE - OBESITY, DIABETES, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE ARE ALL DIET-RELATED THAT COST THIS COUNTRY MORE Fulkerson: EVERY MINUTE, IS KILLED BY HEART DISEASE. 1,500 PEOPLE A DAY COMBINED, OVER 1 MILLION AMERICANS CASES OF DIABETES PARTICULARLY AMONG - DIABETES. - LIFE-THREATENING DIABETES. Fulkerson: ONE OUT OF THREE WILL DEVELOP THIS CRIPPLING MILLIONS OF OTHERS SUFFER FROM A HOST MILLIONS MORE OF US COFFEE, AND ENERGY DRINKS THAT WE'VE MASKED BUT COULD THERE BE TO ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS? A SOLUTION SO COMPREHENSIVE, THAT IT'S MIND-BOGGLING HAVEN'T TAKEN IT SERIOUSLY? - SOMEONE HAS TO STAND UP ISN'T ANOTHER PILL. THE ANSWER IS SPINACH. Fulkerson: A GROWING NUMBER THAT IF WE ELIMINATE, REFINED, PROCESSED, WE CAN PREVENT AND, SEVERAL OF OUR WORST DISEASES. THEY SAY ALL WE NEED TO DO PLANT-BASED DIET. IT SOUNDS ALMOST Fulkerson: YOU MIGHT NOT EXPECT TO EXPLORE THE CONNECTION ON MY WAY OVER, I ALSO HAD A 12-OUNCE COKE AND ANOTHER HALF Fulkerson: THE HEALTHIEST LIFESTYLE. AND I'VE EATEN MORE BUT AS PART OF MY EFFORT BETWEEN FOOD AND HEALTH, I VISITED TWO PHYSICIANS DR. MATT LEDERMAN - HI. - LEE FULKERSON. - NICE TO MEET YOU TOO. - THIS IS DR. PULDE. - HI, DR. PULDE. Fulkerson: BOTH ARE M.D.s. DR. LEDERMAN WAS TRAINED AND DR. PULDE THEY INCORPORATE A WHOLE INTO THE TREATMENT - SO LET'S GET AND THEN WE'LL - 142/82. Fulkerson: I FOUND OUT LIKE A LOT OF AMERICANS, I THOUGHT MY HEALTH - LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS. Fulkerson: I HAD NO - HOLD THEM NORMAL. Fulkerson: BUT I HADN'T HAD SO I DECIDED TO GET ONE. WHEN DR. LEDERMAN GAVE ME IT WAS I GOTTA SAY I'M REALLY WORRIED 240 AND 241 IS WAY HIGHER I GOT THIS SIX NUMBER. THAT, TO ME, IS THE SIX NUMBER OF SOMETHING CALLED WHICH MEASURES THE INFLAMMATION THIS PUT ME IN THE HIGH-RISK SO I COMMITTED UNDER DR. LEDERMAN'S THE PLAN WAS TO TREAT BY EATING A WHOLE FOODS, THE IDEA OF USING NUTRITION TO PROMOTE GOOD HEALTH INDEED, HIPPOCRATES, THE ANCIENT GREEK FATHER SAID, &quot;LET FOOD BE THY YET IT WASN'T THAT THE SCIENCE WAS SYSTEMATICALLY PROBED TWO RESEARCHERS WHO'VE MADE TO THIS EFFORT AND DR. CALDWELL ESSELSTYN. BORN JUST A FEW MONTHS APART THEY EACH GREW UP ON FARMS. CAMPBELL'S CHILDHOOD FARM WHERE HIS FAMILY RAISED DAIRY MY DAD AND MOTHER MOVED HERE WHEN I WAS NINE YEARS OLD. AND DURING THAT TIME, SOMEWHERES WHICH IN THOSE DAYS WAS Fulkerson: AT THE TIME, NATURE'S PERFECT FOOD. SO PERFECT, IN FACT, FROM THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY WHO HAVE JUST BEEN WEANED SHOULD BE SWITCHED - THAT WAS THE EXCITEMENT PRODUCING NATURE'S Fulkerson: ESTABLISHED IN 1675, THE ESSELSTYN'S FARM ON THESE ROLLING HILLSIDES, THEY GRAZED BOTH BEEF THIS WAS SORT OF THE OPERATION IN A WAY? - MORE OR LESS, ABSOLUTELY. THIS IS SORT OF THE EPICENTER, THIS IS THE WAY FARMING - AND SO THIS IS THE CRAFT-- - THE TRADE OF FARMING. HOW OLD WERE YOU - SEVEN. I DIDN'T START TILL I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD. [laughing] - A LATE BLOOMER, RIGHT? - YEAH, EXACTLY. BUT I ENJOYED IT, AND I REALLY GOT A GREAT KICK Fulkerson: ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T FARM LIFE HAD ON BOTH CAMPBELL AND ESSELSTYN. - TO MAKE IT SUCCESSFUL, STAYING POWER, - I GUESS IT'S IRONIC NOW ADVOCATING THAT WE WERE BUSY ACTUALLY Fulkerson: DURING CAMPBELL THE AMERICAN DIET NEAR THE BEGINNING AMERICANS EACH ATE ABOUT BY 2007, TO NO LESS THAN 222 POUNDS. IN 1913, OF PROCESSED SUGAR HOWEVER BY 1999, OUR CONSUMPTION HAD RISEN TO OVER 147 POUNDS. IN 1909, AMERICANS CONSUMED AROUND 294 POUNDS BUT BY 2006, HAD MORE THAN DOUBLED BY THE EARLY 1950s, CAMPBELL WHILE ESSELSTYN WENT TO YALE. AS PART OF YALE'S ROWING TEAM, ESSELSTYN WON DURING THIS SAME DECADE, THE PACE OF AMERICAN LIFE EVEN WITH OUR FOOD. THE LATE '50s WAS THE HEYDAY THE SUPERMARKET IN THE NEWLY BUILT, THIS WAS WHEN THE SO-CALLED LIKE THE LEGENDARY NOT TO MENTION A HOST OF DEVISED TO MAKE BY NOW, COLIN CAMPBELL WAS IN GRADUATE SCHOOL WHICH HAD ONE NUTRITIONAL SCIENCE DEPARTMENTS HIS RESEARCH WAS ON ANIMAL - BUT IT WAS FOCUSED FOR THEIR ABILITY MEAT, MILK, AND EGGS, AND SO MY OWN RESEARCH MAKING SURE WE GOT ENOUGH. IT WAS CONSIDERED IT WAS ONE OF AND WITHOUT PROTEIN, SO IT WAS A LIFE FORCE. IN FACT, THERE WERE STATEMENTS MADE THAT THIS IS THE STUFF Fulkerson: PROTEIN WITH ANIMAL-BASED FOODS IT STILL IS TODAY - WHY DO YOU THINK MEAT IS - PROTEIN. - PROTEIN. - PROTEIN. - PROTEIN. - PROTEIN. - WE NEED PROTEIN, DON'T WE? YOU CAN'T LIVE - THE IDEA THAT PLANTS ALSO DIDN'T COME INTO PLAY UNTIL MAYBE THE LATE 1800s, AND THEN IT STRUGGLED Fulkerson: NO MATTER WHAT SOURCE IN THE LATE 1950s, THE WORLD NEEDED - WE HAD A LOT OF STARVING AND MALNOURISHED CHILDREN AND SO IN MY COMMUNITY, THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS YOU KNOW, WHAT COULD BE DONE? AND ONE WAS TO MAKE SURE I CERTAINLY WENT ALONG Fulkerson: DR. CALDWELL ESSELSTYN HIS MEDICAL CAREER AT THE WORLD FAMOUS CLEVELAND SURGERY SOON - THERE'S SOMETHING IF YOU CAN REMOVE THE DISEASE. FOR INSTANCE, IF A PATIENT YOU COULD REMOVE THEM. IF IT WAS A GASTRIC ULCER YOU DIRECTLY COULD IF IT'S A HERNIA, Fulkerson: DURING THE 1960s, HEART DISEASE WHAT DOCTORS COMMONLY CALL IS USUALLY CAUSED THAT SUPPLY THE HEART WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT OVER TIME, A FATTY SUBSTANCE IN THE BUILDS UP RESTRICTING THE BLOOD FLOW THIS CAN ULTIMATELY FROM SEVERE CHEST PAIN, TO HEART ATTACKS. CHOLESTEROL PRODUCED BY ALL ANIMALS, AND IT'S AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT BUT WHEN WE CONSUME WHICH IS ONLY FOUND LIKE MEAT, EGGS, IT TENDS TO STAY THIS SO-CALLED PLAQUE ON THE INSIDE AND IS THE MAJOR CAUSE IN THE LATE 1960s, AT THE CLEVELAND CLINIC IN THE TREATMENT IN FACT, ESSELSTYN IN THE CLINIC'S HIS NAME - RENE REALLY SPARKLED AND IN 1967, HE DID AT THE CLINIC-- Fulkerson: THIS REVOLUTIONARY WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY REMOVING THEN STITCHING IT ON THE HEART'S TO ALLOW THE BLOOD TO FLOW TODAY, OVER 500,000 AMERICANS FOR HEART BYPASS SURGERY. COSTING AROUND THESE OPERATIONS ALONE OF NEARLY $50 BILLION. JOEY AUCOIN WHERE HE OWNS AND OPERATES I TELL EVERYBODY--THE JOKE I DON'T EAT TO LIVE, AND I--MY WHOLE LIFE, Fulkerson: IN 2004, JOEY HAD A DANGEROUSLY AND A HAZARDOUS THIS NOT ONLY MADE HIM BUT A PRIME CANDIDATE - THIS IS UM, I GOT TWO PILLS THEN I GOT ONE FOR CHOLESTEROL, AND THEN I TAKE BYETTA, EVERY MORNING BEFORE BREAKFAST AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING AND I KNOW IT MAKES ME TIRED, AND I JUST-- I ONLY SLEEP I JUST HATE TAKIN' 'EM. Fulkerson: IN THE MID 1960s, DR. CAMPBELL TRYING TO GET MORE PROTEIN TO MILLIONS TO KEEP COSTS DOWN, HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES DECIDED THE PROGRAM WAS BEGINNING BUT THEN, DR. CAMPBELL STUMBLED THAT WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. IT CENTERED ON THE MORE AFFLUENT WHO WERE EATING RELATIVELY HIGH - BUT AT THE SAME TIME, MOST LIKELY WHO WERE SUSCEPTIBLE Fulkerson: SINCE LIVER CANCERS - BUT JUST THE MERE FACT SAID, YOU KNOW, THIS IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. Fulkerson: CAME ACROSS A SCIENTIFIC PAPER PUBLISHED IN A LITTLE-KNOWN IT DETAILED WORK ON A POPULATION THAT WERE FIRST EXPOSED TO THEN FED A DIET OF CASEIN, - THEY WERE TESTING ON THE DEVELOPMENT THEY USED TWO DIFFERENT LEVELS THEY USED 20% AND THEN THEY USED 20% TURNED ON CANCER, Fulkerson: THIS INDIAN PAPER, TOGETHER WITH ABOUT INCREASED LIVER CANCERS EATING ANIMAL-BASED FOODS, COMBINED TO CREATE AND HIS LIFE. - BECAUSE WE LEARNED WAS REALLY GOOD Fulkerson: THE WAY AMERICANS ATE THE NUMBER OF FAST-FOOD AS MORE AND MORE BEGAN USING THEM TO FEED THEMSELVES WHILE THE FAST-FOOD REVOLUTION THE RATE OF CANCER DEATHS WAS CONTINUING TO RISE. AS A RESULT, IN 1971, PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON THAT WAS DUBBED - WE ARE HERE TODAY OF SIGNING AND I HOPE THAT WE MAY LOOK BACK AND THIS ACTION AS BEING TAKEN DURING Fulkerson: ON THE FRONT LINES WAS CALDWELL ESSELSTYN. BY 1978, HE WAS CHAIRMAN AT THE CLEVELAND CLINIC. YET THE MEDICAL PROCEDURES - NO MATTER HOW MANY I WAS DOING FOR WOMEN I WASN'T DOING FOR THE NEXT UNSUSPECTING Fulkerson: SO DR. ESSELSTYN THE GLOBAL STATISTICS ONE OF THE FACTS HE DISCOVERED WAS THAT THE INCIDENCE WAS FAR LOWER THAN IT WAS IN FACT, IN 1978, GETTING BREAST CANCER IN KENYA WERE 82 TIMES LOWER DR. ESSELSTYN BY THE NUMBERS HE DISCOVERED IN THE ENTIRE NATION HOW MANY AUTOPSY-PROVEN DEATHS WERE THERE FROM CANCER 18. 18 IN THE ENTIRE NATION. THAT, TO ME, WAS PUBLIC HEALTH FIGURE THAT Fulkerson: IN THE SAME YEAR, WAS ONLY ABOUT TWICE YET THE NUMBER EXCEEDED 14,000. DR. ESSELSTYN IN THE EARLY 1970s, THE RISK WAS 12 TIMES LOWER AND IN THE HIGHLANDS HEART DISEASE THE LINK HE NOTED BETWEEN ALL - VIRTUALLY, THE WESTERN DIET THEY HAD NO ANIMAL PRODUCTS. THEY HAD NO DAIRY, NO MEAT. Fulkerson: EVEN MORE COMPELLING WAS SOME HISTORICAL DATA IN WORLD WAR II, AMONG THE FIRST THINGS ALL THE LIVESTOCK TO PROVIDE SUPPLIES SO THE NORWEGIANS WERE FORCED TO NOW WE LOOK AT THE DEATHS JUST ANTECEDENT FROM HEART ATTACK 1927, 1930, '35. LOOK AT RIGHT UP HERE. RIGHT AT THE VERY TOP, 1939. BINGO! IN COME THE GERMANS. IMMEDIATELY, 1940, WOW. '41, '42, '43, '44, '45. HAVE WE EVER SEEN A POPULATION HAVE THEIR CARDIOVASCULAR LIKE THIS FROM STATINS, FROM BYPASS SURGERY, OR FROM STENTS? NO. BUT LOOK WHAT IMMEDIATELY WITH THE CESSATION BACK COMES THE MEAT, BACK COMES I MEAN, IT'S SUCH BUT, UH, WE DIDN'T GET IT. Fulkerson: BECAUSE DR. ESSELSTYN WAS MAKING THAT DR. CAMPBELL WAS DUE SEEING A CAUSAL LINK AND SOME OF BUT THEY WEREN'T COMING TO THIS CONCLUSION. ANOTHER WAS IN THE MID 1970s, HE BEGAN PRACTICING ON - WHAT I OBSERVED THERE DIFFERED DRAMATICALLY HOW LONG PEOPLE WHO WERE RAISED IN JAPAN, FIRST GENERATION WHO HAD WERE ALWAYS TRIM, PROSTATE CANCER, COLON CANCER, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, NEVER OVERWEIGHT. THEY WERE IN THEIR 80s AND 90s THEIR KIDS GOT A LITTLE FATTER, THEIR GRANDKIDS WERE JUST AS FAT AND SICK AND WHAT CAME THROUGH CLEARLY THE FIRST GENERATION HAD LEARNED IN THEIR NATIVE LAND. BUT THE KIDS, THEY STARTED AND REPLACE IT THE DAIRY PRODUCTS, AND THE RESULTS WERE OBVIOUS. THEY GOT FAT AND SICK. SO I KNEW AT THAT POINT Fulkerson: AT THE TIME, HOWEVER, KNEW VIRTUALLY NOTHING EVEN SO, THEY ULTIMATELY REACHED THAT MANY OF COULD BE GREATLY REDUCED, SIMPLY BY EATING WHAT THEY CALL THIS MEANS CONSUMING FOODS FROM WHOLE, SUCH AS FRUITS, VEGETABLES, IT ALSO MEANS AVOIDING SUCH AS MEAT, AS WELL AS PROCESSED FOODS REFINED SUGARS, AND OIL. CAMPBELL AND ESSELSTYN'S WOULD CHANGE - SO, I WENT THROUGH THE GOALS THAT I HAVE-- FROM YOU WERE: ELIMINATE YOU WANT TO GET OFF YOU WANT TO SLEEP WELL YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT. YOU WANT TO STOP FEELING TIRED YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT. - THAT'S IT. YOU GOT IT. THE OTHER COMPLAINTS: YOU HAD SINUS PROBLEMS, POST NASAL DRIP, WHEEZING, COUGHS, LOOSE STOOL, DIARRHEA, BLACK AND BLOODY MUCOUSY STOOL AND DIFFICULTY WALKING, TROUBLE LOSING WEIGHT, CHRONIC GROGGY AFTER MEALS, AND ANXIETY ALL OF THAT STUFF-- - [laughs] HARP ON THE BAD STUFF, THAT WILL ALL-- MY GOALS, I'M ADDING IN. - WHICH GOALS DO YOU HAVE? - I WANT YOU TO REVERSE THE ONES THAT WE CAN REVERSE, AND MOST OF YOURS, WE COULD. I TOLD YOU BASED ON WHAT I TOLD YOU, AND I WOULD STOP THESE, - OKAY, THAT'S YOU'RE GONNA GET MY BEST-- I CAN TELL YOU THAT. YOU'LL DO WELL. Fulkerson: BY 1975, DR. CAMPBELL INVESTIGATING WHAT HE'D - OUR WORK IN A SENSE, ONE, I WANTED TO REPLICATE, BECAUSE IT WAS SO PROVOCATIVE. SECONDLY, I WANTED TO STUDY Fulkerson: JUST CAMPBELL FED HALF THE RATS A DIET OF 20% CASEIN, THE MAIN PROTEIN THE OTHER HALF OVER THE 12 WEEKS THE RATS EATING HAD A GREATLY ENHANCED LEVEL OF ON THE OTHER HAND, ALL OF HAD NO EVIDENCE BUT DR. CAMPBELL DECIDED TO TAKE THESE FINDINGS THIS TIME, ON THE SAME DIET HE KEPT THEM IN ONE GROUP AND SWITCHED THEIR DIETS BETWEEN 5% DOING SO THE RESULTS WERE ASTONISHING. WHENEVER THE RATS WERE FED EARLY LIVER TUMOR GROWTH BUT WHEN THE SAME RATS TUMOR GROWTH - I MEAN, THIS IS SO WE COULD TURN ON JUST BY ADJUSTING THE LEVEL GOING FROM 5% TO 20% IS WITHIN THE RANGE THE TYPICAL STUDIES ON CHEMICAL ARE TESTING CHEMICALS MAYBE THREE OR FOUR ORDERS THAN WE EXPERIENCE. Fulkerson: DR. CAMPBELL DISCOVERED OF PLANT PROTEINS DID NOT PROMOTE CANCER. HOWEVER, THERE'S A LONGSTANDING THAT ANIMAL PROTEIN CONNIE DIEKMAN MS. DIEKMAN AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SHE'S THE PAST PRESIDENT OF THE AND AN ADVISOR - WHEN YOU ELIMINATE ANIMAL YOU RUN THE RISK ANIMAL PROTEINS PROVIDE THAT WE NEED FOR CELL GROWTH, TISSUE REPAIR, - EATING WHOLE FOODS, TO BE PROTEIN DEFICIENT BECAUSE THAT HAVE THE LEAST AMOUNT LET'S SAY POTATOES, YOU KNOW, 8%, 9%. WELL, THAT'S THE FIGURE Fulkerson: DR. CAMPBELL'S ABOUT THE WAY GENES, AND NUTRITION INTERACT - CANCER STARTS WITH GENES. IT MIGHT BE GENES IT MIGHT BE GENES THAT ARE SO THOSE GENES BECOME CAPABLE WHETHER WE DO IS PRIMARILY RELATED THOSE CANCER CELLS THAT'S WHERE NUTRITION THEY GROW MUCH MORE RAPIDLY WHEN Fulkerson: DR. CAMPBELL AND HAVE FOUND THAT ONLY A SMALL ARE CAUSED SOLELY BY GENES. - I THINK THE GENERAL CONSENSUS IS THAT PROBABLY IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE GENES - AND THAT'S THE MOST HELPFUL AND HOPEFUL INFORMATION BECAUSE IF YOU GO THROUGH LIFE THINKING THAT FROM A HEALTH PERSPECTIVE YOU'RE A HELPLESS VICTIM. MY DIET I THOUGHT WERE CAFFEINE AND SUGAR. Fulkerson: DR. PAM POPPER OF THE WELLNESS FORUM AND AN EXPERT IN THE AREAS THE WOMEN IN MY FAMILY I DON'T EAT AND LIVE SO, I'VE CHANGED BY NOT ENGAGING Fulkerson: DR. CAMPBELL INITIATED USING VARIOUS THE RESULTS WERE CONSISTENT: NUTRIENTS FROM ANIMAL FOODS WHILE NUTRIENTS FROM PLANT FOODS YET CAMPBELL HADN'T IDENTIFIED THAT CAUSED THE EFFECTS - AND IT FINALLY OCCURRED THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT WAS WE THINK THAT NUTRITION TO INDIVIDUAL NUTRIENTS. AND THAT'S THE WAY AND THAT'S THE WAY THE COMPANIES WHEN, IN FACT, NUTRITION, ALL OF IT WORKING TOGETHER THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT KINDS ALL KIND OF WORKING I MEAN, THE COMPLEXITY IS TOTAL. THAT'S A HOLISTIC CONCEPT. AND I HAD TO SAY TO MYSELF, Fulkerson: THAT HIS DISCOVERIES WERE SIGNIFICANT, HOW WERE THESE FINDINGS HOW DO DIFFERENT TYPES AFFECT CANCER CAMPBELL NEEDED HE WOULD SOON FIND - SO MANGOES ARE REALLY GOOD. THEY FLAVOR THINGS - OKAY. YOU WANNA GET A RIPER ONE. Fulkerson: DR. MATT LEDERMAN ARE AMONG A SMALL BUT WHO USE A WHOLE FOODS, AS A PRIMARY TREATMENT FROM SHOPPING HOW TO READ NUTRITION LABELS... - AND I DON'T CARE ON THE FRONT, both: LOOK AT THE INGREDIENTS. - AND THAT'S Fulkerson: TO SHOWING PATIENTS THEY ARE DOCTORS LEDERMAN AND PULDE BECAUSE THEY FEEL IT'S MEDICINE THAT NOT ONLY MAKES BUT THAT TRULY IMPROVES Fulkerson: IN 1973, PASSED AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT ENCOURAGED A MASSIVE ONE OF THE MAJOR BYPRODUCTS WAS A LOW-COST SWEETENER CALLED COMPANIES COULD ADD FROM SODA POP TO HOT DOGS, AND THEN MAKE THESE PRODUCTS PROCESSED SUGARS ARE FAR MORE CALORIE-DENSE THAN THE WHOLE PLANTS THE DRAMATIC INCREASE IS A MAJOR REASON WHY TO EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGIST THE CONSUMPTION IS THE MAIN CAUSE FOR THE IT ISN'T THAT PEOPLE IT ISN'T BECAUSE THEY'RE LAZIER WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT ARE BEING FOOLED. Fulkerson: WITH A RANGE OF RECEPTORS THAT HELP US GAUGE THESE INCLUDE STRETCH RECEPTORS THE SHEER VOLUME OF FOOD WE ALSO HAVE TO HELP DETERMINE OR WHAT WE MORE COMMONLY CALL FOR INSTANCE, 500 CALORIES FILLS THE STOMACH COMPLETELY, TRIGGERING BOTH OUR STRETCH TO SIGNAL OUR BRAIN BUT 500 CALORIES OF UNNATURALLY FILLS THE STOMACH FAR LESS, DECEIVING THESE RECEPTORS THAT WE NEED TO EAT MORE. EVEN WORSE WHICH IS ALMOST PURE FAT AND BARELY TRIGGERS - THE PROBLEM WITH IS THAT IF YOU MAKE THESE FOODS WHICH WE DO TODAY, YOU WIND UP WITH A PROBLEM JUST TO BE SATISFIED. Fulkerson: BUT WHY DO THAT ARE SO HARMFUL TO US DR. LISLE TO A SYSTEM CALLED THIS IS A TRIO THAT NATURE HAS DESIGNED SO THEY CAN SURVIVE ON TO THE NEXT GENERATION. THE FIRST LEG IS PLEASURE SEEKING. - AND, PRIMARILY, TWO THINGS AND THOSE TWO THINGS SO IN THE CASE ITS BASICALLY GOT A NEON SIGN SAYING, &quot;FOOD, SEX, UNLESS IT'S A MALE, THEN IT BUT IT'S PRETTY MUCH Fulkerson: THE OTHER TWO LEGS ARE AVOIDING PAIN AND DOING EVERYTHING - PLEASURE SEEKING, AND ENERGY CONSERVATION, THAT REALLY WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OR A GREAT WHITE SHARK. Fulkerson: RICHER FOODS BECAUSE IT'S NATURE'S WAY THEY WILL PROVIDE THE HIGHEST WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT THIS HELPED OUR ANCESTORS FIND AND RIPE FOODS AVAILABLE, WHICH CONTRIBUTED BUT IN TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT, WE CAN ARTIFICIALLY INCREASE WELL BEYOND WHAT OUR ANCESTORS THE RESULTING FOODS GIVE US A LEADING US INTO SOMETHING DR. LISLE WHAT THE PLEASURE TRAP IS BETWEEN OUR NATURAL INSTINCTS, WHICH ARE TRYING TO TELL US AND SOME KIND OF ARTIFICIAL, THAT IS PIGGYBACKING SO THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE WOULD BE DRUGS THE WAY DRUGS WORK THE EXISTING PLEASURE CIRCUITS. WHEN CERTAIN CHEMICALS THEY CAUSE FEELINGS Fulkerson: THE SAME WHEN WE EAT HIGHLY CONCENTRATED, - WE'VE REMOVED THE FIBER, WE'VE REMOVED THE MINERALS. WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING TO HYPER-CONCENTRATE SUGAR AND ADD A BUNCH OF SALT AND NOW IS IT'S BECOME THESE THINGS ARE DRUGS. THEY HAVE OTHER DELETERIOUS NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS ADDING Fulkerson: DR. TERRY MASON FOR THE CITY OF CHICAGO. HE'S ONE OF THE FEW PUBLIC WHO OPENLY SUPPORTS - IF IT WALKED, HOPPED, SWAM, HAD EYES, A MOM AND A DAD-- Fulkerson: DR. MASON CONTENDS THAT THE LESS AFFLUENT SEGMENTS HAVE DIFFICULTY MAKING - WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THE DIETS ARE CALORIE-RICH THIS IS THE REAL PROBLEM. AND, UNFORTUNATELY, POOR PEOPLE THEY'RE POOR IN HEALTH, THEY'RE POOR IN ALMOST EVERY Fulkerson: THIS MAKES PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE OF HIGHLY PROCESSED FOODS. - PEOPLE WANT STUFF PEOPLE WANT STUFF THAT'S QUICK, AND THEY LIKE THE STUFF AND THEY LIKE THE TASTE AND SO THOSE THAT YOU SEE IN OUR COMMUNITY. Fulkerson: SAN'DERA NATION IN CLEVELAND, OHIO, IN OCTOBER 2008, SHE WAS - I WANNA SAY SOMETHING, I'M GETTING REALLY SHAKY AND THEN I'M COLD AND I'M FATIGUED, AND MY SO I WENT TO THE DOCTOR, AND THAT'S WHEN HE DIAGNOSED ME Fulkerson: LIKE JOEY AUCOIN, SAN'DERA WAS TREATED WITH - I WAS IN DENIAL FOR A WHILE. I HEARD WHAT THEY SAID, I STILL ATE THINGS I DIDN'T REALLY GET THAT I NEEDED TO KNOW, SO I REALLY DEPENDED Fulkerson: THEN SAN'DERA MET WHO RECOMMENDED WITH A WHOLE FOODS, - COME ON IN, - I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS, I WAS REAL INTERESTED AND WHAT AND THE NEW JOURNEY female translator: BETWEEN CHINA Fulkerson: IN 1974, WAS HOSPITALIZED KNOWING THAT HIS DISEASE HE DECIDED TO GIVE HIS COUNTRY A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING SO HE INITIATED ONE OF THE LARGEST SCIENTIFIC STUDIES IN HISTORY. 650,000 RESEARCHERS CATALOGUED CAUSED FOR THE YEARS THE STUDY ENCOMPASSED AND OVER 880 MILLION PEOPLE. ZHOU DIED IN 1976, YEARS BEFORE - OKAY, AND YOU'LL PROBABLY THREE? - YEAH. Fulkerson: WOULD ULTIMATELY HAVE ON WHAT DR. CAMPBELL HIMSELF THE CAPSTONE OF HIS RESEARCH. - EARLY 1980. - AND YOU WERE THERE Fulkerson: DR. JUNSHI CHEN IS WITH THE CHINESE CENTER FOR HE FIRST MET DR. CAMPBELL WHEN HE WAS A MEMBER OF FOOD AND NUTRITION SCIENCE. THE COLD WAR AND DR. CHEN WAS AMONG FROM CHINA BY THEN, ONE NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTS WHEN THEY DISCOVERED A SIGNIFICANT COLLABORATION - THIS IS THE ATLAS Fulkerson: PUBLISHED IN 1981, WAS THE RESULT OF ZHOU ENLAI'S IT SHOWED A HIGHLY UNUSUAL OF DIFFERENT TYPES WHICH TENDED TO BE CLUSTERED THE SAME WAS TRUE AND THE COUNTIES WERE OFTEN FAR GREATER THAN THE COUNTIES - SO, FOR EXAMPLE, ACCORDING TO THIS CANCER MAP, THE MORTALITY HAS AMONG DIFFERENT COUNTIES - THAT'S HUGE. - AND IN--I UNDERSTOOD, ONLY SEVERAL-FOLD DIFFERENCE. - MAYBE TWOFOLD OR SO, - YEAH, YEAH. IN TERM OF, SO, WHY? BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CHINESE. GENETICALLY, AND THE WHY THEY HAVE IN SINGLE CANCER MORTALITY? SO WE BELIEVE IT HAS TO BE THE BIGGER ENVIRONMENT. AND FROM OUR OF COURSE, - DR. CHEN AND I SAID, &quot;WHY DON'T WE JUST GO THERE Fulkerson: FOR DR. CAMPBELL, IT WAS THE OPPORTUNITY AMONG OTHER THINGS, HE COULD ABOUT LIVER CANCER AND THE FINDINGS APPLIED TO THE PROJECT WOULD CONSIDER 367 DIET MAKING IT ONE NUTRITIONAL STUDIES DR. CAMPBELL CAREFULLY CHOSE 65 COUNTIES THESE COUNTIES WERE OR SEMI-RURAL AREAS. - WE USED THE RURAL COUNTIES BECAUSE THEY ARE STABLE AND THEY HAVE BEEN FOR AT LEAST Fulkerson: MORE THAN 350 WORKERS THEY CAREFULLY SURVEYED OF 6,500 PEOPLE URINE AND BLOOD SAMPLES IN 1983, DOCTORS CAMPBELL, CHEN, BEGAN TO ANALYZE THAT HAD BEEN COLLECTED. THE JOB WOULD TAKE YEARS. AFTER EIGHT WEEKS EATING JOEY AUCOIN WAS STILL OFF - WHEN I STARTED THIS, FROM MEDICATION BUT NOW I'M GETTING IN BETTER I FEEL MORE HEALTHY. I VERY SELDOM I JUST FEEL THIS--THIS IS THE SCALE AND IT STARTED ABOUT EIGHT WEEKS AND NOW IT'S BOUNCING NONE OF MY BELTS FIT. THIS ONE HERE, TWO NEW HOLES PUNCHED IN, NOTHING FITS. IT'S JUST EVERYTHING, A GOOD PROBLEM TO HAVE. - IT'S BEEN FUN FOR HIM, BECAUSE I THINK HE'S LEARNED IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT THAT IT'S...HE LOVES IT. - I DON'T THINK HE FEELS TOO GOOD, EVEN IF HE STARTED HE FEELS TOO GOOD, HIS ENERGY'S - AND THE FACT ON ALL THE MEDS, I THINK THAT THAT'S FOR HIM TO MAINTAIN Fulkerson: IN THE MID-1980s, WAS STRUGGLING TO ORGANIZE ON CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. HIS PLAN WAS TO PUT ON A DIET ALONG WITH SMALL QUANTITIES OF AND MINIMAL AMOUNTS - AND SLOWLY I GOT THE 24 PATIENTS BUT THE ONES THEY SENT ME [laughs] WERE A LITTLE THESE WERE PATIENTS THEIR FIRST THEY HAD FAILED THEIR FIRST AND THERE WERE FIVE BY THEIR EXPERT CARDIOLOGISTS THEY WOULD Fulkerson: ONE OF THE MOST WAS A 59-YEAR-OLD SPEECH EVELYN OSWICK. - ATE ALL THE CHOCOLATE CANDY ATE EVERY DOUGHNUT OH, I JUST A LOT OF GRAVY. AND THEN, UM, I HAD MY-- I HAVE HAD TWO HEART ATTACKS WHEN I HAD THE DOCTOR SAID THAT REALLY IS WHAT HE SAID. AND I LOOKED AT HIM AND I SAID, &quot;DO YOU REALLY MEAN &quot;IS BUY A ROCKING CHAIR AND JUST SIT THERE AND HE JUST LOOKED AT ME &quot;YES, THAT'S JUST Fulkerson: ANTHONY YEN WAS BORN - AND WE WERE EATING A VERY SMALL BUT THEY SLICED IT, RATHER THAN WHEN YOU EAT, YOU EAT A LARGE, WHICH YOU COULD EASILY FED AND WE EAT A LOT OF AND WE HAD SOUP. BUT ONCE I CAME YOU FIND BEGINNING THE HAMBURGERS AND I NOTICED MY WEIGHT Fulkerson: WHEN MR. YEN HE SUDDENLY EXPERIENCED - AT THAT POINT IN TIME, I HAVE FIVE BYPASS--FIVE. BUT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING. ABOUT A WEEK LATER, UH, I FELT SO MYSELF AND MY WIFE - I SAW EVERY ONE EVERY TWO WEEKS AND AT THAT VISIT, A FULL CHOLESTEROL LIPID WE WOULD GET AND I WOULD GO OVER Fulkerson: BY USING SIMPLE FOODS AS THE MAIN TREATMENT DR. ESSELSTYN WAS BUCKING THAT WAS DEEPLY ENTRENCHED AND BIG GOVERNMENT. - YOU KNOW, I GOT TO BE KNOWN BUT I GUESS I'VE - WE PREHEATED THE OVEN, I JUST ADDED SOME SEASONINGS. AND THEN WE ADD THE ONIONS - I'VE NEVER BEEN AND, UH, BUT PREVIOUS UM, IT HAD PROBABLY AND THAT ENTAILED NEEDING AND CAFFEINATE MYSELF WITH COKES AND RED BULLS UH, BEFORE I COULD EVEN THINK WE DIDN'T MAKE BUT YOU CAN JUST BOIL AND THEN THROW THIS - RIGHT, RIGHT. HE'S ACTUALLY BUT HE'S EATING THE RIGHT FOODS, SO HE CERTAINLY AND YOU CAN TELL IT IN HIS FACE, YOU KNOW, IN HIS BELLY. IT'S ALL--HE'S LOST HE ALSO HAS A BETTER ENERGY. UM, HE'S WAKING UP THAT'S GREAT, BECAUSE WE HAVE - I DON'T - YOU'RE THE DOCTOR. [both chuckling] Fulkerson: 1990. FOLLOWING NEARLY A DECADE DR. CAMPBELL FINALLY PUBLISH IT IDENTIFIED NO LESS BETWEEN DIET AND DISEASE. - THOSE ARE BIG NUMBERS AND IN WHEN WE DID ALL THESE AND WE LOOKED THAT WERE STATISTICALLY IT WAS BETWEEN WHEN YOU HAVE THAT THEN YOU START IF IT WORKS OUT THIS MEANS ARE POINTING IT'S HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT AND LIKELY TO BE TRUE. Fulkerson: HUNDREDS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. EACH ONE PRESENTED THE RAW DATA THEN THIS INFORMATION IN MULTIPLE WAYS AND TO SHOW HOW IT LINKED THE STUDY EXAMINED. - I THINK THE MAJOR MESSAGE WE GOT OUT OF ALL IS ONLY ONE MESSAGE. THE PLANT FOOD-BASED DIET, MAINLY CEREAL GRAINS, AND VERY LITTLE ANIMAL FOOD IS ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER STROKE, Fulkerson: <i>THE NEW YORK TIMES</i> &quot;THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE &quot;OF THE RELATIONSHIP AND THE RISK FOR DR. CAMPBELL, HE FINALLY HAD AND IT WAS REMARKABLY CONSISTENT TOGETHER, HE FOUND THAT THE WHOLE, PLANT-BASED FOODS WHILE ANIMAL-BASED FOODS SAN'DERA NATION'S JOURNEY WASN'T EASY AT FIRST. - IT WAS A LITTLE HARD, 'CAUSE AND GREASE AND EVERYTHING YOU KNOW, SO IT WAS KINDA HARD TO CHANGING THE NEXT DAY I STARTED A JOURNAL WRITE DOWN MY FEELINGS WHAT I FELT LIKE... COULD KNOW Fulkerson: ALONG THE WAY, SAN'DERA HAD STRONG SUPPORT AND HIS WIFE ANN. - THEY KEEP IN TOUCH, &quot;WE HAVEN'T AND I KNOW THEY HAVEN'T. I REALLY FEEL HERE &quot;I WENT TO WAL-MART THIS DAY. &quot;I HAD WANTED &quot;AND I SAID I'M GONNA &quot;I THEN RECEIVED A CALL &quot;FROM MRS. ESSELSTYN, &quot;AS IF THEY KNEW &quot;SHE STATED, 'PROMISE ME &quot;YOU WILL NOT EAT ANYTHING &quot;IT GAVE ME CHILLS TO KNOW &quot;THEREFORE I LEFT THE STORE WITHOUT GETTING - WHAT DO YOU SEE? Fulkerson: WHILE DR. CAMPBELL DR. ESSELSTYN WAS GETTING FROM THE RESEARCH HE BEGAN WITH 24 PATIENTS, BUT 6 HAD DROPPED OUT LEAVING HIM - AT THE END OF FIVE YEARS, AND 11 OF THE GROUP THERE WAS NO PROGRESSION. AND THERE WERE FOUR WHERE OF REGRESSION OF DISEASE. Fulkerson: THE DIET PRODUCED SOMETHING NEVER HAD BEFORE: ACTUAL THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM CENTERS ON THE LINING THE ENDOTHELIAL CELLS. - THEY ARE OF OUR BLOOD VESSELS. YOU'RE YOUNG, AND YOU'RE YOU COULD SPREAD AND YOU'D HAVE SOMETHING SIX OR EIGHT TENNIS COURTS. Fulkerson: IN 1988, THAT ENDOTHELIAL CELLS THE GAS NITRIC OXIDE. - WELL, NITRIC OXIDE KEEPS WITHOUT BEING STICKY. Fulkerson: IT ALSO HELPS TO DURING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND INHIBITS - AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, FOR ELIMINATING THAT SEEMS Fulkerson: HOWEVER, SCIENTIFIC THAT WHEN WE START EATING OUR ENDOTHELIAL CELLS - WHEN YOU'RE GETTING TO BE AND YOU'VE BEEN SLAUGHTERING YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE SIX YOU MAY BE DOWN AND THEY CAN'T PROTECT YOU. Fulkerson: YET ACCORDING WHEN WE BEGIN EATING THE DAMAGE TO OUR ENDOTHELIAL IT STARTS TO REVERSE. ABOUT FIVE YEARS ESSELSTYN MADE A SMALL IN HIS PATIENTS' MENU. IT STARTED IN 1990, WHEN HE READ THE GLOWING REVIEW IN <i>THE NEW YORK TIMES.</i> - DR. ESSELSTYN SAW THAT, AND HE INVITED ME TO COME HE WAS ORGANIZING IN ARIZONA. Fulkerson: WHO, UP UNTIL THEN, HAD BEEN FINALLY MET FACE-TO-FACE. - ON THE ONE HAND, I'M COMING GETTING SOME IDEAS. HE'S COMING AND DOING HERE'S THE SCIENCE, PUT THE TWO TOGETHER, Fulkerson: WHEN HE LEARNED ESSELSTYN REMOVED DAIRY PRODUCTS THE RESULTS OF HIS ONGOING STUDY AND IN 1995, DETAILING THEM YET ONE OF ESSELSTYN'S INVOLVED A COLLEAGUE OF HIS DR. JOSEPH CROWE. - ACTUALLY I WAS, VERY BUSY, UH, MID-40s, ABSOLUTELY, AT ALL FOR ANY HEART PROBLEM. Fulkerson: BUT DR. CROWE, EVEN A HEALTHY CHOLESTEROL LEVEL, WAS ACTUALLY RAVAGED THIS ANGIOGRAM, TAKEN AFTER HIS FIRST NEARLY SHOWS HOW BADLY DAMAGED ONE OF THIS ANGIOGRAM WAS DONE OF ENTIRELY DIETARY TREATMENT. DR. CROWE WAS FORTUNATE. IN 25% OF CASES, SUDDEN DEATH IS THE FIRST AND ONLY SIGN OF DR. ESSELSTYN'S ALL SURVIVED THE INITIAL TODAY, OVER TWO DECADES - THE THING ABOUT ESSY, ALTHOUGH WHEN YOU SAID, &quot;I'M GOING AND I'M GOING TO STAY YOU STAYED WITH THE DIET, YOU HAD NO CHOICE. I MEAN, BUT HE IS VERY STERN. YOU KNOW, BUT, YOU KNOW, HE'S JUST... HE'S JUST A WONDERFUL MAN. - AND I LOOK SOME OF MY PICTURES YEARS AGO, ACTUALLY LOOKS THE ONLY THING IS Fulkerson: ANTHONY ALSO NOTED ANOTHER CHANGE. - WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG, WHEN YOU WERE TEENAGER, YOU SEE A FEMALE OR SO ON, AND THE FIRST REACTION YOU KNOW, IT GETS ATTENTION, RAISE THE FLAG, I CALL IT. THIS HAPPENED TO US, DR. ESSELSTYN'S, UH, I CALL 'EM THE FLAG STILL RISES. - TALKING TO YOUR DOCTOR MAY BE THE LAST THING BUT IT'S DEFINITELY - I'M A PRACTICING UROLOGIST AND HAVE BEEN SO AND ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION THE FIRST CLINICAL INDICATOR OF GENERALIZED IT'S THE CANARY IT'S THE THING THAT YOU HAVE AND VASCULAR DISEASE, MUCH EARLIER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WE HAVE LIKE IT'S COMPARTMENTALIZED. THE BLOOD GOES EVERYWHERE AND SO IF YOU HAVE YOU HAVE IT EVERYWHERE. Fulkerson: DESPITE THE APPARENT SOME CRITICS SAY EATING - NOW, WITH THE WESTERN DIET, THIS GUARANTEES A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE WHO WILL HAVE TO HAVE THE FRONT THEIR HEART EXPOSED, THEN VEINS WILL BE TAKEN AND SEWED ON THEIR HEART. SOME PEOPLE Fulkerson: DR. ESSELSTYN OVER 250 PATIENTS USING ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY - HEART DISEASE, IS AN ABSOLUTELY THAT NEED NEVER, EVER EXIST. AND IF IT DOES EXIST, [dramatic music] Fulkerson: LAS VEGAS, NEVADA. AT THE EXTREME COUTURE GYM, WE FOUND AN EXTRAORDINARY ULTIMATE FIGHTER CHAMPION IN THE MIXED MARTIAL ARTS STRENGTH, TOUGHNESS, ARE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE, - I HAD CUT DAIRY OUT OF MY DIET UM, BECAUSE I HAD A, UH... EAR, NOSE, AND I WAS GETTING AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO WHEN I CUT THAT OUT, THAT WAS SEPARATING ME WAS CHICKEN AND FISH. SO I WAS JUST EATING AND I WAS EATING IT BECAUSE BECAUSE EVERYONE TELLS YOU, IF YOU'RE AN ATHLETE, AT LEAST CHICKEN AND FISH YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN PERPETUATED ALL IT TOOK WAS ME CUTTING AND I DID IT COLD TURKEY. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE, THINK SOMEONE SOME SKINNY HIPPIE TYPE AND, UH, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO BREAK I JUST--I TRIED THE DIET AND IT WORKED FOR ME, I FEEL LIKE I HAVE MORE ENERGY NOW THAT I DON'T EAT AND I ALSO FEEL LIKE I RECOVER I'M NOT TRYING TO BE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I'M JUST DOING MY THING, YOU KNOW, DON'T PLAN OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT - THIS, UH, GUIDE IS CALLED NOW, IT INCLUDES FOODS IN THE BASIC FOUR FOOD GROUPS, BECAUSE WE ARE CONCERNED AND THIS IS A PART OF IT. - WE MUST SERVE 1/2 PINT TO PROVIDE CALCIUM, AND THE OTHER NUTRIENTS THAT Fulkerson: FOR DECADES, THE DAIRY INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT MILK WHILE ALL WHOLE FOODS AN ESSENTIAL NUTRIENT IT IS ARGUED THAT WE NEED FOUND IN DAIRY. CHILDREN AND AGING WOMEN HAVE BEEN SINGLED OUT TO DRINK - WHAT DO YOU THINK WE GET FROM DAIRY PRODUCTS IS, - CALCIUM. - CALCIUM. - CALCIUM. - CALCIUM. - CALCIUM. - CALCIUM. - THE SCIENCE IN TERMS IS PRETTY STRONG, AND, IN FACT, THE NATIONAL OF COURSE, UTILIZES THAT SCIENCE Fulkerson: OSTEOPOROSIS IS WHICH HAS BEEN WIDELY LINKED IF THIS IS TRUE, NATIONS WITH WHICH ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF SHOULD HAVE BUT ACCORDING TO A STUDY DONE BY A DISTINGUISHED NATIONS WITH HIGH LEVELS TEND TO HAVE HIGH LEVELS WHICH IS A KEY INDICATOR - AND SO, IN FACT, THE HIGHER THE HIGHER THE RATE EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE HAS BEEN TELLING US ONE OF THE PRIMARY MECHANISMS TENDS TO CREATE AN ACID-LIKE CALLED METABOLIC ACIDOSIS. Fulkerson: THE BODY DRAWS UPON ITS MOST NAMELY CALCIUM IN OUR BONES. AS THE CALCIUM IS EXTRACTED OUR BONES ARE WEAKENED. IN DEFENDING MANY NATIONAL HEALTH THAT WE CONSUME - IT CAN BE MILK, IT CAN BE CHEESE, IT CAN BE BUT AGAIN, IT'S A MESSAGE THAT COMES FROM THE AMERICAN THE NATIONAL OSTEOPOROSIS WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE. IT NEEDS TO - SO AS THE FAT'S TAKEN OUT, THE PROTEIN BECOMES A LARGER SO THEY BECOME HIGHER AND WHEN WE COMPARE LOW-FAT MILK PRODUCTS, WITH PROSTATE CANCER, THE RELATIONSHIP FOR CIGARETTE SMOKING - MOST OF THESE ANIMALS HERE - UH-HUH. - THEY'RE THE YOUNG FEMALES, - SO THEY HAVEN'T - HAVEN'T - SO THEY HAVE TO HAVE BEFORE THEY CAN LACTATE. - AND ONCE THEY COME THEY ALMOST KEEP THEM, THEY KEEP THEM FOR THREE OF FOUR YEARS. - WHY ARE - WELL, THIS IS THE LAST TIME, THEY'RE GOING TO SEE GRASS. AFTER THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE STANDING UP - WHEN I WAS YOUNG, PROMOTED OUR PRODUCT, BECAUSE IT WAS AND, UH, SO I BELIEVED THAT. BUT IT TOOK A SLIGHTLY I MEAN, IT'S THE MOST PERFECT AND TRYING TO SWITCH THE MILK OF DOESN'T MAKE A LOTTA SENSE. Fulkerson: ONLY TWO MONTHS SAN'DERA WAS EXPERIENCING ON HER TYPE 2 DIABETES SINCE I'VE BEEN BLOOD PRESSURE'S MY BLOOD SUGARS IT SHOCKS ME, 70s. SO I WAS ALARMED I'M LIKE, &quot;AAH! YOU KNOW, AND I TALKED WHICH IS WONDERFUL. SHE'S LIKE, &quot;NO, YOU'RE PANCREAS IS WORKING, Fulkerson: AT AN OUTPATIENT FACILITY YET THE TREATMENT THAT WAS ACHIEVING SUCCESS CAME FROM OUTSIDE THE POSITIVE RESULTS SAN'DERA'S CHRONIC DISEASES. - MENTALLY, THE FEAR BECAUSE I FEEL I'M IN CONTROL AND HAVE POWER OF TAKING SO, MENTALLY, I FEEL GREAT. I'M EATING THE ONE THING THAT IS TRUE &quot;YOU REALLY START TASTING THE REAL TASTE CAUSE I'D EAT A PEACH, [sighs] I WAS IN HEAVEN I GET TO EAT, AND THAT FEELS GOOD BRINGING THE SUGAR DOWN, YOU'RE LOSING THE WEIGHT, YOUR WHOLE YOU KNOW, I THINK ON, YOU KNOW, OUR DOCTORS WE SHOULD TAKE A LITTLE BIT AND CHECK IT OUT Fulkerson: AND SPEAKING HOW DOES SAN'DERA'S FEEL ABOUT HER NEW LIFESTYLE? WHEN I RECENTLY ABOUT MY BLOOD SUGARS MY QUESTION WAS, &quot;SHOULD I SHE SAID, &quot;NO, YOU STILL TAKE AND SHE SAID, &quot;WHAT IS TAKE YOU OFF AND I'M LOOKING LIKE, &quot;YEAH, THE GOAL.&quot; SO THERE'S STILL PEOPLE [laughs] - SALLY AND JIM EAT IT'S A GOOD BREAKFAST TODAY, THEY'RE HAVING MILK, POACHED EGGS, THEY ARE STARTING Fulkerson: NUTRITIONAL GUIDELINES IS THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT THE U.S.D.A. HELPS DETERMINE TO EVERYONE FROM OUR SOLDIERS TO OUR KIDS THESE GUIDELINES ARE INFLUENCING FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. DR. DAVID KLURFELD IS AND NATIONAL PROGRAM LEADER WITH THE U.S.D.A.'S - WE'VE MADE DIETARY SINCE THE 1890s, AND THAT WAS BEFORE WE KNEW SUBSEQUENTLY, WE'VE AND WE HAD THE BASIC 4 AND 5 AND 7 AND 12, AND IT VARIED Fulkerson: PERHAPS THE WAS THE &quot;BASIC FOUR&quot;, IN A LEAFLET CALLED THE MAINSTAY OF NUTRITION THE BASIC FOUR DEFINED WHAT AN ENTIRE GENERATION BELIEVED WAS HEALTHY TO EAT. THE FOUR FOOD GROUPS BY THE &quot;FOOD PYRAMID,&quot; THESE GUIDELINES RECOMMEND THREE SERVINGS AND MEAT IS STILL IN FOLLOWING &quot;MY PYRAMID,&quot; CAN EAT A DAILY MENU OF A BOWL OF LUCKY CHARMS AND A GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE CHEESE-FLAVORED CRACKERS A CHEESEBURGER WITH FRENCH-FRIES CHOCOLATE PUDDING AND GRAPES AND CHICKEN NUGGETS AND CANNED GREEN BEANS WITH LOW-FAT ICE CREAM - I SEE NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING THAT WE FEED MANY OF OUR WE SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED THAT AT THE RATES Fulkerson: DR. NEAL BARNARD AND PRESIDENT FOR RESPONSIBLE MEDICINE. - WELL, THE PROBLEM IS, DOWN THE SCHOOL LUNCH LINE, YOU SEE FEDERAL POLICIES THERE ARE BURGERS THE MILK BUT THE VEGETABLES AND FRUITS, AND THIS IS BECAUSE ARE GOING TO PARTICULARLY AND OTHER PRODUCERS AS WELL. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT HAS ALL TO DO OF THE BIG AGRIBUSINESS - WHAT WE HAVE IS IT'S REALLY AND, OKAY LET'S HAVE ONE, BUT THAT SAME GROUP CANNOT HELP SUBSIDIZE MANAGE COMMODITY FOODS, SUBSIDIZE THE PRICE AND THEN TURN AROUND AND SAY, &quot;OKAY, WE'RE GOING THEY'RE GOING TO TELL PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR CONSTITUENTS, WHICH ARE THE FARMERS, Fulkerson: IN 1998, BARNARD'S - EVERY FIVE YEARS, THE DIETARY GUIDELINES THAT'S THE BLUEPRINT OF WHAT TO BE HEALTHY. AND WE LOOKED AT THE PANEL THAT 6 OF THE 11 WITH THE FOOD INDUSTRY. SO WE SAID, THERE ARE LAWS ABOUT AND HOW TRANSPARENT THEY VIOLATED THOSE. AND WE BROUGHT THEM TO COURT, AND IT WAS A LONG TRIAL, BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THAT THE POLICIES CONTINUED TO FAVOR INDUSTRY - I DON'T THINK WITH INDUSTRY CONNECTIONS AND THE FOOD INDUSTRY, PRIMARILY BECAUSE HAS A QUESTION SHOULDN'T THEY AND IF THE BEST SCIENTISTS ARE CONSULTING I STILL WANT THE BEST SCIENTISTS THAT MAKE NUTRITIONAL FINANCIAL CONFLICT IS ONLY ONE CONFLICT YOU KNOW, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO'VE SPENT TRYING TO PROVE THAT A OR THAT RED MEAT NOW, THEY BUT THEY TOO HAVE - YOU KNOW, I HAD THOSE BIASES, TOO. BUT I GOT TO A POINT THAT I WAS GETTING RESULTS WHAT I HAD THOUGHT WAS TRUE. SO I HAD TO SELF-REFLECT, LOOK AT IT REALLY CAREFULLY, AND I CHANGED MY VIEWS. Fulkerson: DR. CAMPBELL PAID HE'S BEEN MARGINALIZED BY KEY ADMINISTRATORS THIS AFTER BEING AND SECURING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR CORNELL'S NUTRITIONAL HE HAD CANCELLED WHO HAD LONG BEEN TO THE DAIRY INDUSTRY. NUMEROUS OBSERVERS FEEL THAT VIOLATED THE STANDARDS DR. CAMPBELL HAS ALSO WITNESSED OVER RESEARCH THE GOVERNMENT'S ONE EXAMPLE HE CITES THE PRESTIGIOUS - THE BUILDING BEHIND ME HERE THE SINGLE IN THE AREA OF SCIENCE THIS IS WHERE SCIENTISTS ABOUT ISSUES OF THE DAY AND DETERMINE HOW THAT SCIENCE IN THE EARLY DAYS THOSE PANELS WERE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, I HAVE SEEN COMING IN TO SUPPORT AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE BEING ESPECIALLY THE CHAIRS AND, OF COURSE, THEY CAN PICK THEY WANT TO PICK IN ORDER TO GET A CERTAIN KIND IT'S NOT THE WAY AND I'M SURE THAT HOW POWERFUL IS THIS INFLUENCE, - I HAD BEEN A RUNNER IN FACT, A MARATHONER. 47 YEARS OLD, Fulkerson: IN 1982, CAME TO A SUDDEN STOP WHEN SHE WAS DIAGNOSED AFTER A MASTECTOMY, HER DOCTORS AND RADIATION THAT HAD BY THEN SPREAD RUTH DECIDED TO VISIT - AND I SAID, &quot;COLLECTING INFORMATION &quot;IT'S ALL IN THESE FILES &quot;SIT IN MY OFFICE AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK.&quot; - HE SAID, &quot;THESE ARE &quot;WHAT I'M TRYING TO PROVE IS THAT DIET - AND SHE READ IT, AND SHE COMES OUT AND SHE SAYS SHE CHANGED HER DIET. - SO HE SHOWED ME NO ADDED OILS, LOTS OF FRUITS Fulkerson: FOR THE IRONMAN TRIATHLON WHICH COMBINES RUNNING WITH LONG-DISTANCE BIKING - I BECAME OBSESSED. KEPT UP THE RUNNING, OF COURSE, AND THEN ADDED SWIMMING, AND, FOR GOOD MEASURE, AND PEOPLE WERE SAYING, YOU'RE A CANCER PATIENT. DOCTORS TOLD ME THIS. I FELT SO GOOD. I FELT FIT, AND I WANTED TO AND I FELT SURE THAT AND I WAS PUTTING THAT I COULD BEAT THIS CANCER. Fulkerson: RUTH WON A GOLD MEDAL - STUCK WITH THE DIET. FOUND OUT MY CONSTIPATION MY DANDRUFF DISAPPEARED. NO SIGN OF DEPRESSION, WHICH YOU MIGHT EXPECT I FELT RENEWED, AND OUT TO SHOW THAT DIET THAN ANYBODY EVER THOUGHT. MMM! - OTHER WOMEN COLON CANCER, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO'VE ALL OVER THEIR BODY WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH WHAT WE IN OTHER WORDS, AND IT'S NOT WHEN YOU GET THIS DIAGNOSIS. RUTH DID. - SO I'M STILL RACING. STILL DAILY TRAINING. NOW HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THEIR 70s NOT VERY MANY. SO THAT GIVES HOPE THAT NOT ONLY AND BEAT THE DEGENERATIVE BUT YOU CAN START Fulkerson: HAVE PROFOUND GLOBAL EFFECTS. IT TAKES OVER TEN TIMES FROM FOSSIL FUELS TO PRODUCE THAN IT DOES TO PRODUCE SINCE THE 1970s, HAS BEEN DESTROYED. THAT'S AN AREA 80% OF THIS CLEARED LAND THE WORLD'S CATTLE ALONE 8.7 BILLION PEOPLE, NEARLY 2 BILLION MORE WITH ALMOST ACROSS THE GLOBE, REDIRECTING USED TO FATTEN CATTLE EVERY HUNGRY MOUTH FOR GENE BAUR, COMBINED WITH A DEEP RESPECT HELPED CONVINCE HIM MR. BAUR IS PRESIDENT AND NEAR WATKINS GLEN, NEW YORK. IT PROVIDES A SAFE HAVEN THAT HAVE BEEN ABANDONED - I GREW UP EATING ANIMALS BUT ONCE I STARTED CONSIDERING I RECOGNIZED THAT AND THE MORE I LEARNED, THAT I WAS HEALTHIER AND THAT I HAD A MUCH THE LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY TO GLOBAL WARMING THAN THE ACCORDING SO BY EATING MEAT, MILK, WE'RE HARMING OUR OWN HEALTH, WE'RE SLAUGHTERING EVERY YEAR IN THE U.S., AND WE'RE DESTROYING Fulkerson: STATISTICS COMPILED AND THE WORLD HEALTH DEMONSTRATE THAT DIET HAS ON HEALTH. THESE ARE THE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS PRODUCED IN NINE COUNTRIES, A FIGURE THAT'S CLOSELY RELATED THESE ARE THE NUMBERS OF DEATHS IN THE SAME COUNTRIES. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE VERY SAME DISEASES CONTINUE EVEN WITH SPENT ON CARDIAC TREATMENT, HEART DISEASE IS STILL KILLING OVER - AND THE ELEPHANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STENTS IS THE FACT THAT IN AN EMERGENCY, THESE PROCEDURES BUT WHEN THESE PROCEDURES DO NOT PROTECT Fulkerson: ARE USED MAINLY TO YET ACCORDING ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE ARE CAUSED BY THE LARGEST THE REST ARE CAUSED BY THE MORE THAT ARE FAR MORE INFLAMED AND MUCH MORE LIKELY THAN THE LARGER, AND SO THIS IS WHY DON'T TREAT THE DISEASE. THEY ARE TREATING SYMPTOMS. Fulkerson: DOCTOR ESSELSTYN HAS THAT HE HAS RECOMMENDED TO ONE OF HIS SONS, RIP ESSELSTYN, TO FUEL A SUCCESSFUL AS A PROFESSIONAL TRI-ATHLETE. WHEN RIP TURNED 34, HE WAS READY AND TRAINED RIP WAS ASSIGNED IN AUSTIN, TEXAS. WE'RE INCREDIBLY COMPETITIVE AND WE LOVE MAKING BETS. SO WE WERE OUT AND WE KIND OF MADE TO SEE WHO HAD SO THE NEXT MORNING, AND THE RESULTS CAME BACK. AND IT LEAD TO A DISCOVERY JAMES RAY, OUR RESIDENT REDNECK, PRETTY MUCH MEANS YOU'RE AND SO WHAT WE DID, IS THE NEXT DAY WE WENT ABOUT TO BASICALLY SAVE HIS LIFE Fulkerson: THE MEN AGREED TO BUT IN TEXAS, - MEAT'S ALMOST I HAVE SEVERAL GOOD FRIENDS THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. THAT'S THEIR SPORT - TEXANS ARE SERIOUS - TEXAS, KANSAS. [alarm beeping] [siren wailing] - WELL, GUYS ASSOCIATE BEING AND IF YOU'RE A FIREFIGHTER, LAST YEAR, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IN THE UNITED STATES. 52% OUR NUMBER ONE KILLER FOR FIREFIGHTERS Fulkerson: AFTER JUST J.R. TESTED AND IT DROPPED 148 POINTS, HIS RESULTS WHO ALSO SAW AND THEIR ENERGY LEVELS RISE. AS FIREMEN, THEY WERE THEY WERE IN BETTER - ONE OF THE THINGS IS YOU DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WE MAY HAVE WHERE WE HAVE TO GO WITH AIR PACKS ON, WITH ALL WITH A HIGH RISE PACK ANYBODY CAN GO BUT NOT EVERYBODY CAN GO UP, AND RIGHT THERE AN ADDITIONAL 75 TO 100 POUNDS THAT YOU HAVE TO CARRY YOU HAVE TO HAVE AND STRENGTH REAL...MEN...EAT...PLANTS. REAL...MEN...EAT...PLANTS. [laughs] YOU KNOW WHAT, EVERYBODY THINKS BUT OVER 70% OF OUR CALLS WHERE WE ARE RESPONDING HYPERTENSION, TYPE 2 DIABETES, AND SO WE SEE, BASICALLY THE DESTRUCTION BY THE STANDARD AMERICAN DIET. TO ME, THE ANSWER IS JUST ABSOLUTELY SO SIMPLE, IT'S JUST RESPONSIBILITY AND STARTING TO IT'S THAT SIMPLE. Fulkerson: AFTER 13 WEEKS ON IT WAS TIME TO GET - WHEN YOU STARTED, YOUR WEIGHT NOW 211 POUNDS. - OKAY, THAT'S GOOD. - IT'S A 20-POUND DROP THERE. - YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE WAS IT'S NOW 112 OVER 70. - WOW. - THAT'S A NICE DROP.

LAST TIME, WHICH IS SORT OF THE MARKER IN THE HEART AND THAT WENT FROM 6.0 Fulkerson: I SIGNIFICANTLY OF GETTING A HEART ATTACK - TOMORROW MARKS I'VE LOST 45 POUNDS. I'VE REVERSED - YOU HAVE TO KNOW IS SO INCREDIBLY PROUD - I DON'T HAVE TO RELY I HAVE A LOT OF ENERGY MY CHILDREN LOVE IT. THEY'RE SO PROUD OF ME, I HAD A LITTLE SAYING FOR MAYBE THE LAST TWO YEARS. AND IT'S &quot;WIN THE WAR. &quot;DO NOT LET ONE LOST BATTLE &quot;IF YOU DO BREAK DOWN AND GIVE &quot;JUST GET RIGHT NOT TOMORROW, THE DIABETES I'M NOT NOR THE WEIGHT. THE MESSAGE IS, YOU'RE IN Fulkerson: JOEY AUCOIN HAD INCLUDING TYPE 2 DIABETES. BUT AFTER 22 WEEKS EATING HIS CONDITION HAD CHANGED - HEY, HOW YOU DOIN'? - BACK AGAIN. YOUR WEIGHT IS DOWN 28 POUNDS. YOU FEEL BETTER 26 OUT OF 27 COMPLAINTS YOUR MARKER OF INFLAMMATION IS DOWN TO UH, YOUR BLOOD SUGARS THEY CONTINUE TO COME DOWN WHICH ARE GONNA GET BETTER. YOUR CHOLESTEROL THAN IT WAS BEFORE YOU EVER STARTED YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE COMPARED TO HOW IT WAS IT WAS STILL ELEVATED.
