Preview Welcome to My World Good Morning! { One cosy morning in England } I hope you're well! There's a snowstorm on its way today, and I can already feel the hush in the air. But first, coffee {Meanwhile, in the garden...} {...Mr Blue is our first visitor} {Mia, followed closely behind} The garden feels like a gathering place for all of us today. Even the cats are here, waiting for company. We'll be joining them in just a minute. Before the storm rolls in, I need to prepare the garden. Some areas have many leaves and fallen apples to clear. { Luke came to say 'hi' too } With snow in the forecast, I thought it was the perfect day to start decorating for Christmas! We have two Christmas trees, one of which is in the kitchen. I'm hoping to create a magical, fairytale Christmas vibe in my kitchen. Most of the decorations will be added in this episode. I've cleared and cleaned the spaces where I want everything to go. But first, let's head to the garden and say hello to the cats while I get it organised. I went out wearing only my sweater, but soon enough I realised it wasn't the best idea and went back for a coat. My little visitors don't seem to be bothered by the cold with their thick, furry coats; they come here in all weathers, even though they have cosy homes to return to There's something magical about winter mornings in the garden. Even before the snow comes, it feels so alive. Mr. Blue looks bored and is trying to get Mia to play with him (with no luck ) He decided to settle under the table for a bit before wandering off to explore on his own; curiously sniffing around every corner as he went. As the first whispers of winter approach, clearing the fallen leaves from the garden feels like a gentle act of renewal. Each leaf gathered is a quiet reminder that even in the stillness of winter, there is work to be done --preparing the earth for the season's slumber. The crisp air, the soft rustle of branches, and the weight of the leaves beneath my hands all bring a sense of peace. With each sweep, and each cut I clear the old to make space for the beauty to come... knowing that the garden will rest and, in time, bloom again. Working in the garden can be deeply therapeutic. It connects us to the natural world, offering a quiet space to reflect and restore. My garden is all tidy now, so let's head back home and start the best part--decorating for Christmas! This year, I'm keeping Christmas more traditional. Using what I have, adding little touches from the garden, and creating a space that feels warm and welcoming. If you'd like more information on anything, (the brand and place where I got it from) do feel free to leave a comment, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can! There's something so comforting about a classic Christmas -- vibrant colors, soft lights, and that sense of nostalgia. The blend of greens and reds, pine and cinnamon, and fairy lights creates a cosy atmosphere. I absolutely love festive kitchen towels! They're the simplest and the cheapest way to transform a kitchen into a festive space. Gingerbread houses and nutcrackers--together, they create a magical scene where the spirit of Christmas comes alive in the simplest of joys Holly's always been a big part of Christmas, hasn't it? In ancient times, people believed holly had protective qualities, warding off evil spirits and bringing good luck. As Christianity spread, it became linked to Christmas, symbolising the crown of thorns and the blood of Christ. Its evergreen nature also represents eternal life, making it a perfect decoration for a season about hope and new beginnings. While decorating my kitchen for Christmas, I get this lovely feeling inside, as if I'm being transported to Mrs. Santa Claus's kitchen. Although my youngest family member mentioned it gives off Frozen and Elsa vibes (LOL) - They love it! I'd love to hear how you're decorating for Christmas! The real Nutcracker is definitely the most important part of the kitchen Everyone loves using it! It was a rare find, to be honest. There are so many nutcrackers out there, but most of them are just for decoration. If you have a nutcracker that actually cracks nuts but is a different design from mine, please let me know in the comments... I'd love to expand my collection. I will be setting up a Christmas cocoa bar in my next episode, so please stay tuned for that! The beauty of a rustic Christmas is that it doesn't take much to transform a space; a few thoughtful details can turn any room into a festive retreat in minutes! It's not about extravagance, but about creating a cozy haven filled with memories, warmth, and the joy of the season. By adding a few trimmed branches from my garden, I've created a lovely rustic woodland Christmas vibe in my kitchen. It's all starting to come together quite nicely. A magical fairytale Christmas isn't about lavish decorations; It's more about capturing that fairytale feel of the forest. At least, that's how I see it. And let's not forget about the windows! I'm decorating my windows with natural elements this year, and it's turning out so lovely! I'm also creating a little Christmas village scene on the windowsill, with these adorable battery-operated houses that light up. It's all coming together so nicely--really makes the room feel warm and magical, like a little winter wonderland inside! Few hours later... Winter has officially started in the UK! { Winter Wonderland! } I feel as though I've just stepped through my kitchen door into Narnia's frozen kingdom! It's so peaceful! and so quiet! After the storm, the garden feels like another world! Even the birds are gone, leaving this perfect silence behind. I feel as though I'm in a completely new land, ready to explore. It's moments like these that make winter feel so magical. Nature has a way of decorating too, doesn't it? It's as if the snow has given the garden ...a new life, covering everything in a blanket of stillness and beauty. beautiful, and serene It's moments like this, standing in the stillness, that make all the work--preparing, decorating, tidying--feel worth it. Even the smallest details--like the frost on the branches and the icicles--feel like little gifts. We don't get a lot of snow in England, so when it does happen, we really cherish those few days. This snow will probably last for 3-4 days and won't return until the end of January (for a day or two), and even that isn't guaranteed. There's something truly magical about the serenity of a winter wonderland. The stillness of the snow-covered landscape, with every tree and branch gently kissed by frost, creates a peaceful silence... ...that feels almost otherworldly. The crisp, cold air seems to quiet everything, and in that calm, you can't help but feel a sense of awe and tranquillity. It's as if time slows down, inviting you to pause and soak in the beauty of the moment, where everything feels pure and untouched. While winter's chill isn't always pleasant, it gently forces us to slow down, stay indoors, and take the time to relax and recharge. Don't get me wrong, the snow and cold also have a destructive power... crushing my Cosmos flowers under their weight and forcing the bushes to bend low in defeat. Yet, in their harshness, there's also a quiet reminder of nature's resilience. Beneath the frozen surface, life is still at work, regenerating, restoring, and preparing for the warmth that will come. The snow may silence and bend, but it's also a force that nurtures the earth, allowing new growth to emerge when the time is right. It's a cycle of destruction and renewal, reminding us that even in the coldest, darkest days, beauty is never truly gone --it's simply resting, waiting to return. Remember, no matter what challenges come your way, you have the strength to overcome them; just like those plants Even in the coldest and darkest moments, there is always light ahead, waiting to shine through. Stay hopeful and take each step forward with faith--amazing things are waiting for you. And on that note, I'd like to wish you all an absolutely amazing day. Thank you for being here today!
