With Hannibal's arrival, hit the ground running. In typical Roman fashion straight at the enemy, and for his first combat with Before the battle, Hannibal so he staged a gladiatorial death match between captured Celt prisoners with the winner getting He then explained that the &quot;A metaphor, for what?&quot; &quot;You, these warriors are you. You're trapped in Italy with no escape. Your only choice now is to fight and win.&quot; &quot;What about the dead guy?&quot; &quot;That's you if you don't win.&quot; &quot;And the prizes?&quot; &quot;That's what you stand &quot;And the fact that I've soiled myself in all this excitement?&quot; &quot;That, no, that's not &quot;Okay.&quot; Hannibal also smashed again for inspiration. Scipio, on the other hand, opted for the more classic route of a rousing pre-battle speech. &quot;Look at the men. Weak, starved by the Alps, while we are the strongest This will be easy. Like 10,000 horse-sized ducks It'll be like Mike Tyson in A tug of war between 10 help me out here, Ralph.&quot; &quot;A baby, sir.&quot; &quot;Yes, yes, that's it, a baby. The point is, there is we could lose a battle this easy. So if everybody's ready (Roman soldiers yelling) (Roman soldiers screaming) The Battle of Ticinus was over almost as soon as it had begun, as the Romans found themselves by Hannibal's famed lightning a key element in Hannibal's devastating double envelopment tactics. In the chaos, Scipio was wounded. Thankfully, according his handsome 17-year-old saw his father fall. Scipio the Younger, and in the process earned The Romans ended up fleeing the area, destroying the bridge For a nation so overtly believing Hannibal to be an easy kill, the Romans found themselves running away with their tail between their legs. It was humiliating. And do you know who thought so as well? The Celts. They began flocking to Hannibal's Even Celtic troops fighting began to reconsider. &quot;Man, I'm thinking we should &quot;I hear you, maybe we What do you think he'd like?&quot; &quot;Hmm, oh, I know.&quot; &quot;Hey, Hannibal, we wanna join your side and we brought you a present.&quot; &quot;A gift for me? I hope it's Roman heads.&quot; Oh, please, oh, please be Roman heads. How did you know?&quot; Running away from Hannibal but having dozens of Romans Now that's embarrassing. Ticinus had been a but the psychological impact And it was only just a taste of what Hannibal was capable of. Despite the shocking Rome still didn't seem to posed by the monster now The Senate was full of excuses. &quot;It's those traitorous &quot;Yeah, and it was a cavalry battle, wait until Hannibal faces &quot;And our Consul was bald, once he faces our other then he'll really pee his pants.&quot; That other Consul, Longus had been in the south all this time, preparing to invade Africa. He had seen some success but then he heard the news, &quot;Hannibal's in Italy, and But, but I was gonna be the big boy. I was gonna invade &quot;Well, you can be a big boy at home.&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Does somebody need a nap, sir?&quot; &quot;No, no, no!&quot; And so Longus brought his army when he arrived in the area to decisively neutralize Hannibal. The two Consuls joined creating a double consular army. But the two Consuls weren't &quot;Having a nice rest there, old man?&quot; &quot;I'm wounded, Longus.&quot; &quot;Pathetic.&quot; &quot;You don't understand. He's more dangerous than we thought.&quot; &quot;Maybe for you, whoops.&quot; &quot;Listen, we can't just march straight at him like we normally do. We need to train our and we'll try again in spring.&quot; &quot;Sorry, I don't take advice &quot;H-hey, I'll kick your ass, Longus.&quot; &quot;Any day now.&quot; &quot;I'm coming, just you wait.&quot; &quot;Oh, Scipio, you feeble old man.&quot; (Longus screeches) Scipio was apparently quite cautious after his recent encounter with Hannibal, while Longus, typically Roman, couldn't wait to give Hannibal a swirly. So who would get their way? Well, when two Consuls it turned out the Romans had They would each take turns Consul one would lead one back and forth, back and forth. As you can imagine, when the things didn't go so well. In this case, due to Scipio's injury, Longus probably assumed even Hannibal had Celtic He fully understood the Roman system and Longus's hotheaded nature, and he knew he could exploit it. &quot;For goodness sake.&quot; &quot;What's wrong, sir?&quot; &quot;I'm trying to order some pizza, but I keep getting fed about being a hothead. I'm not a hothead, am I?&quot; &quot;No, sir.&quot; &quot;Look at this, butt insurance? Who would buy butt insurance?&quot; &quot;Yeah, that sounds really stupid.&quot; &quot;Sir, it seems like a lot of data brokers have collected data on you.

Oh yeah, Roman heads, a double Hannibal needed to keep in order to maintain the And so he was eager to The combined Roman force So he carefully crafted a clever trap, and he made sure to spring it, while Longus was still in charge. The plan began with his army &quot;All right, boys, time for lights out.&quot; (Carthaginian soldiers whine) &quot;Sorry, but we got a big day ahead of us. Tomorrow we're gonna massacre the Romans.&quot; (Carthaginian soldiers cheer) &quot;Goodnight boys, dream of revenge.&quot; (door clicks) &quot;Gorzog, send out the cavalry.&quot; (dramatic music) That night, Hannibal's Numidian cavalry made their way over to the Roman camp arriving just before dawn. &quot;Hey, Romans, wakey, wakey.&quot; &quot;What, what the, what's going on?&quot; &quot;Hey, Longus, your butt &quot;It does not. Scipio, awaken the troops.&quot; &quot;Longus, these playground insults are clearly meant to lure you out.&quot; &quot;Well, it's working, send out the troops.&quot; &quot;Longus, it's clearly a trap.&quot; &quot;And I'm falling for it, &quot;Hey guys, wake up, you're &quot;What? But we haven't had breakfast.&quot; &quot;We're skipping breakfast.&quot; &quot;I don't think you can do that.&quot; As the Romans hurried out of camp, the Numidians began luring them back to the Carthaginian camp, were just awakening from their slumber. &quot;Eat up boys we're having pancakes.&quot; (Carthaginian soldiers cheer) While the Carthaginians were enjoying their hearty breakfast. The starving Romans &quot;Hurry up, we have to Hey, why have you stopped marching?&quot; &quot;Longus, there's a freezing &quot;Well get your gluteus (Roman soldiers yelling) &quot;All right, boys, time to lather up. This oil will insulate you from the cold. It also smells like lavender.&quot; (Carthaginian soldiers hum) &quot;There's the Carthaginian &quot;Sir, I take the water from the river is beginning to ice over. I can't move.&quot; &quot;Oh, oh, I'm sorry, you Sitting around a nice hot campfire playing truth or dare with your friends? Welcome to the real world.&quot; &quot;Truth.&quot; &quot;Who do you like?&quot; &quot;Sharon.&quot; &quot;Ew.&quot; &quot;Hey, look, guys, the Romans are here.&quot; (Roman soldiers shivering) Having perfectly orchestrated events so that his enemy was while his men were well When the two sides engaged one another, the Romans were in no condition to fight. And the cherry on top? The previous night, Hannibal had sent out an elite force of men led by his brother to go and hide behind a bush. They suddenly sprung out who were then cut to pieces. Once again, Hannibal's superior cavalry and double envelopment tactics But the key word at Trebia was control. Hannibal used his intel on the enemy and the environment of the battlefield to carefully control the creating lots of little that paved the way to success. And concealing troops for an ambush? All of these things are what make Hannibal the genius he's remembered as today. As for Longus, he managed with a small number of troops. Disgraced, he didn't want this Senate to find out what had happened, and he began obscuring &quot;Longus, where have you been? We've been looking for you.&quot; &quot;Uh, nowhere in particular.&quot; &quot;Longus, 30,000 men are missing. Do you know where they are?&quot; &quot;Uh, they're taking a bath.&quot; &quot;30,000 men, all in a bath.&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Longus, what's under that rug?&quot; (flies buzzing) &quot;Aurora Borealis.&quot; &quot;Aurora Borealis? Oh.&quot; &quot;Well, that's my consulship over. Good luck with Hannibal, bye.&quot; Trebia had been a disaster for the Romans. And as even more Celts Rome largely lost its In Rome, complacency turned to alarm. Hannibal had outwitted and inflicted a costly defeat. But with that, Scipio and Longus's terms They were replaced with two new Consuls, Servilius and Flaminius. The Romans may now have begun to realize the trouble they were in, and the genius Hannibal had The Romans had expected to be Remember, they thought they Now their plans lay in ruins, and they were levying 11 new legions to deal with the threat, Hannibal had completely redefined the war. But Hannibal had a little Things had gone well so far, but the Celts were notoriously fickle. And Hannibal needed to ensure and his base of support in Italy. Any Celts he captured fighting for Rome he treated extremely well and allowed them to return to their homes. But the longer he hung eating all their food and leaving beard the more resentful they may become. They wanted to go south and And Hannibal also hoped to sway Rome's other Italian allies So from here, the path was clear. Hannibal had to move south. Just one problem. There were two main routes Hannibal could take to move south. And wouldn't you know it? That's exactly where the had taken fortified positions. If Hannibal tried to move on them, he'd be fighting from a and could be bottled in. &quot;There is a third option.&quot; &quot;Ooh, tell me, tell me.&quot; &quot;We could move through this flooded with dirty, stinky that at times would come up to our necks.&quot; &quot;But there's no way we That it'd be crazy, right? (playful music) Hannibal?&quot; Hannibal's four day trek was hell on Earth, almost as crazy as when Imagine three full days because there's nowhere Meaning four full days without sleep slugging through heavy mud. You contract cholera. Your foot falls off and Jimbob directly in front of you won't stop pooping in your path. In fact, everybody's pooping in your path. Some delirious sleepless and say, &quot;Man, I could And then they would. When Pack animals died, it gave nearby men a chance to rest, but only for a few moments before they were whipped back into line. Even Hannibal himself couldn't &quot;Hey, Hannibal, if we see I need to take a leak.&quot; (Carthaginian soldiers screaming) &quot;What?&quot; &quot;Geez, Hannibal looks like you picked up a nasty eye infection. Normally for this sort of thing, we'd just wash it out But as you can see, water everywhere, but it's full of Jimbob's poop.&quot; &quot;No worries, doc, I'll just (Carthaginian soldiers gasp) &quot;That'll be $3,000.&quot; When the now possibly one-eyed Hannibal and his army emerged from the But he had just managed to slip 50,000 men right past the Romans where he could replenish his supplies and his Celt allies could go crazy securing Roman loot and booty. As fields and villages went up in flames, one Roman Consul couldn't help but notice. The hotheaded Flaminius, feeling it was his responsibility Rather than waiting for his immediately left to go chase Hannibal. Now this Flaminius was He was what the Romans called a new man. He came from the lower plebeian and as a result, he reportedly had kind of a screw you attitude and a big old, arrogant Picture Sid Vicious wearing And Hannibal, thanks to Just as with Longus, was just the kind of man Hannibal led Flaminius to along the north shore of Lake Trasimene. Flaminius watched as Hannibal's &quot;I've done it, I've spotted the enemy.&quot; &quot;Uh, sir, that big &quot;Follow us&quot; sign seems kinda like they're &quot;Yes, Gareth, and I'm taking the bait.&quot; &quot;Sir, this really seems like a trap.&quot; &quot;Yes, Gareth, and I'm falling for it.&quot; Daylight was fading, so for The two armies encamped across and night fell over the two camps. In the morning, Flaminius and he would be the hero of Rome. For now, the Romans got nice Goodnight, Flaminius. Good night, Rome. Good evening, Hannibal. During the night, Hannibal (Flaminius snoring) as tens of thousands of troops (Roman soldiers snoring) scaled the wooded hills above the pass, (Roman soldiers snoring) completely undetected by Rome's scouts. (Flaminius snoring) (upbeat music) &quot;Let's go girls.&quot; Flaminius took off across the lake shore to try to catch Hannibal. As he did, even the weather A thick fog rose from obscuring visibility. &quot;Look at this, this is perfect. The mist will obscure our approach. Hannibal will never see me coming.&quot; (battle horns blast) &quot;Sir, why does it sound are charging down the hill towards us? &quot;You mean 50,000 Carthaginians are charging right into my trap.&quot; (Carthaginian soldiers yelling) The Romans found themselves completely hemmed in on all sides. With zero visibility in the fog, the fighting was terrifying and chaotic. Troops were pushed into the where they were either And Flaminius, who likely in his Consul attire caught the attention of one Celt warrior. With his head possibly of how the Romans had According to the ancient writers, (triumphant music) In the three hour long massacre, and an equal number captured. An entire army completely wiped out along with their Consul. During the battle, the Roman vanguard had managed to break through at the front and climb the hill above the fog. When the mist cleared, what and a sea of Roman bodies. Worse yet, when the other to try to aid Flaminius's doomed legions, they too were caught and defeated. A double disaster. (senators screaming) Rome went into a frenzy. For the second time, Hannibal an entire Roman army. Romans were dying by Common citizens began flocking Women waited by the city gates in tears, hoping to hear news of loved ones. This one man, having just led his battered army across now stood less than a To this point, he had been a problem. Now Hannibal was a crisis. And in a crisis, Rome They actually had a system in place when dealing with an They would forego their two and instead, temporarily give one man near total power and authority to be as decisive as he needed and hopefully salvage the situation. This all powerful position had a name, dictator. It's actually where we get the word. But unlike modern dictators, Roman ones didn't score or ride bears through the Siberian Tundra. They held their power for just six months before they were required to give it up. And in Rome's hour of need, the man chosen to be dictator in 217 BC, one of the most highly esteemed Fabius Maximus. So how would Fabius as Well, Fabius understood that marching all of Rome's young men straight into a one-man meat Hannibal was clearly too dangerous to face head on in battle. However, he was also with dwindling manpower and It wasn't a sustainable and he could only remain So if Rome avoided battle with Hannibal to prevent any more crippling losses, and instead simply maneuvered and taking out smaller Hannibal would gradually become weaker while they would And so Fabius presented his &quot;Okay, guys, I have an idea. See if you can follow me here, okay? Instead of fighting we run away.&quot; (senators booing) Fabius's strategy couldn't Romans were meant to march not run away from it. It seemed cowardly and Fabius At this point, Hannibal He had to stay on the and he was still aiming to undermine Rome's As he went in a calculated he devastated the Roman all in plain sight of Fabius and his army. &quot;We're just gonna stand here?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Are you a coward?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;But Fabius, that's my farm.&quot; &quot;Well, MacDonald, thank You're a hero now. Think of the stories you'll tell.&quot; &quot;Old McDonald had a farm.&quot; (cries) &quot;Shut up.&quot; But you know who else Hannibal. He understood the danger he was in. Turning Rome's allies against her, required Hannibal to keep He couldn't do that if Multiple times, Hannibal tried but Fabius wouldn't bite. Failing that he tried to According to the writer, Livy, he burned down all the farms he could. But any farm he learned he left well alone. &quot;Hey, Fabius, why isn't You got some sort of a &quot;What, of course not.&quot; &quot;Hey, Hannibal!&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;Burn my farm too, please.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;Burn my farm too, please.&quot; &quot;No, remember our secret deal.&quot; (sighs) Well, you gotta Hannibal's problem, however, was that he had to stay on the move to keep supplying his At one point, he entered Campania, one of the richest regions of and great for showing up Fabius in front of Rome's south Italian allies. But he was caught in a valley, and Fabius quickly moved &quot;Ha ha, we've got him. After he's used up all the valley's supplies, he'll starve.&quot; &quot;Uh, sir, what are all those Is he trying to escape?&quot; &quot;Lights in plain view? Well, that's a trap if &quot;And we're falling for it.&quot; Suspecting a trap, But other Romans in the valley only to find the Carthaginian army was actually just a herd of oxen with torches tied to their heads. They then found themselves With the Romans distracted Hannibal's army was able to slip away Classic Hannibal. For all his inaction, mockingly dubbed him Fabius the Delayer. But the thing is, Fabius's strategy was probably the best He was right that constant were bleeding Rome dry. And the time he took allowed to recover their forces when while putting Hannibal into an increasingly Modern historians view Fabius's strategy as generally a good idea. To this day, the act of but instead gradually wearing them down is still referred to But when Fabius's term the Senate couldn't have been happier. It was time to start fighting again. However, they probably had a little chat about how they were gonna go about it. See, Hannibal's tactics up Or if you're a Roman, you &quot;I'm sick of it. Every time we try to take this guy down, we march straight at him. But then, oh, no, Hannibal's got 30,000 men up a tree. At this point, I'm not convinced my wife isn't just Hannibal wearing a disguise.&quot; (senator's wife coos) (senator shudders) &quot;Look, this time we obviously Now, granted, we're Roman, so we're gonna march straight That can't be helped, it's in our blood. But I have a proposition. This time when we march straight at him, we do it with a massive army. I'm talking like 80,000 men. It won't matter what kind He can hide in all the bushes he wants. There's no way he can (senators laughing) &quot;Grow up, you know what I mean.&quot; And so it was with two new Consuls Rome put together a massive army. The biggest Rome had ever fielded to put Hannibal away once and for all. To gather them in required, ended up being completely inexperienced. But how much experienced does it take to be expendable war fodder? As this massive army set the Romans knew they Just one victory over Hannibal would likely be enough to And this time, their overwhelming manpower gave them confidence they could do it. Hannibal had taken position where he had captured an With Fabius gone, Hannibal knew the battle was likely coming, and he was eager to fight it on his terms. But when his men looked they couldn't believe &quot;That army's huge. There's no way we can possibly How are we gonna beat &quot;Heh, heh.&quot; &quot;You know what I mean.&quot; &quot;I think he's right, Hannibal.&quot; Hannibal is then said to have replied, &quot;Gisco, my friend, don't worry. There may be a lot of them, there's not a single man named Gisco.&quot; This joke was apparently so funny that his officers began And when his men in the they were like, &quot;Hey, they're laughing. I guess that means we're (Carthaginian soldiers cheer) As for the Romans, the between an inexperienced Although the main historian from this era was good friends with Paullus's family, so take that with a grain of salt. On his day of command, despite the apparent pleas from Paullus sent the army out for battle. And when Hannibal saw And here comes the single largest battle of the Second Punic War and one of the most The infamous Battle of Cannae. In all the pre battle maneuvering, Hannibal was able to ensure his army was fighting from the south. This meant the seasonal dust and blowing directly into Like I said, control. After two years in Italy, had dwindled to about 40,000. The Romans possibly Their army was so big that their maniple stretched far deeper than they normally would. The Romans plan to charge like a battering ram and break it. They also chose a narrow battlefield in the hopes it would prevent Hannibal's far superior cavalry from being able to outmaneuver them. They wanted an honorable rather than trickery, If Hannibal had his say, however, trickery might end up He ordered his line to position themselves as an outward bulge with his weakest troops Just behind them out of stood the elite Libyan infantry waiting for their moment to strike. The battle commenced as smashed into the Carthaginian center. The shape of Hannibal's line ensured the overwhelming hit his weakest troops first, and they were pushed back. Hannibal's outward bulge reversed inward with the Romans being funneled Hannibal had positioned to encourage the troops to hold out as long as possible against because while the Romans were on leashing carnage on the center, Hannibal's cavalry needed The heavy cavalry on the left after a barbaric fight sent with the Consul Paullus even sustaining a severe head injury. He managed to move into the Then the heavy cavalry turned and approached Varro's At the first sight of the Varro ordered his horsemen the Carthaginians had But back in the center, Hannibal's line did to the massive weight of the The Romans pushed deeper and organization within as they became a giant mass trying to massacre the They didn't realize that they were playing At that moment, Hannibal's elite units having done no fighting yet, turned and smashed into the Roman sides. Many of these troops were they had picked up after previous battles, and the confused Romans they were the enemy. As Hannibal managed to regain and encourage them back into the fight, the Carthaginian cavalry And look at what lies before you. A military general's wet dream the total encirclement by a much smaller force. The Romans were trapped. Hannibal had unbelievably managed to use their own superiority rather than simply encircling them, he had actually allowed them and push themselves into This was the genius of Cannae And with that, the annihilation began. For hours the Carthaginians slaughtered the helpless The terrified Romans were so they couldn't even lift their The killing went on so became exhausted from And by the time the the grim toll spoke for itself. To Hannibal several thousand lost. The Romans suffered 60 to Yet another entire army Many high-ranking Romans Paullus for one, but also It's been estimated that 20% of Rome's male population, This was it, Hannibal's vengeance. The stunned Carthaginians as they searched for their couldn't believe the sight of it. An estimated 30,000 gallons of blood now lay spilled on the battlefield. Rome's defeat at Cannae sent Just as Hannibal had hoped, most of southern Italy including the second largest &quot;Wow, Hannibal, this is incredible. What could possibly come next?&quot; &quot;Next? Jimbob, I've killed 150,000 Romans. I've turned her allies against her. That's it, that's vengeance. So let me tell you what comes next. Rome surrenders. (dramatic music) Their territories are reduced. We recover our lost islands. And Carthage dominates the &quot;But sir, what if they don't surrender?&quot; &quot;Jimbob, did you miss what just happened? Of course, they're gonna surrender.&quot; Throughout his campaign to be very adept at But if he now thought it was the first time he And he was about to discover an extremely inconvenient fact about Rome. Rome never surrenders. At a Roman survivor's camp near Cannae. One young officer overheard some troops discussing how they would flee Rome. Drawing his sword he that would abandon Rome That officer was Scipio the Younger, but soon enough, the Romans Scipio Africanus, the hero of Rome. (dramatic music)
