Oh okay back to Colin back to Colin. I'm him. Owen. Okay Maggie you're the last one of the round. We have three bottles and for every one you miss you have to pick a cup. Starting with the normal. Oh that's barely on. One knocks off it's a miss. Oh that's one. That's two. Oh. And if I miss this I'll pick a cup. Oh, she landed it. Doesn't count it's got to be on the stool. I have to pick one and I'm going to get that out of the way right now. Let's go let's go. Alright now they both have to pick two. Last one of the round. Oh my goodness. We're going to try and get a lot more cups out of the way so every time you miss this flip you have to pick another cup. Oh my, what if you miss like 20 times. You're going to have to pick a lot of Cups. Alright I'm going first. Oh no that's 1. 2. Uh only two? 2 cups for me. 1. I'll hold the cup for you. 3, 4. Oh that's not bad. How?! How do you do this? He's literally so good. Subscribe, he does this like every video. 1, 2. I think she's gonna do 20. Maggie might have to pick all the cups. 7, 8, 9. 11, 12, 13, 14. I think she's gonna get out. If I don't get a ball after all these cups. Oh my-I cannot do it. 17 cups. If she doesn't get out I'm gonna be mind blown. I have to pick two cups, he has four. She has to do 17. If she escapes this, she's the luckiest person ever. No not that one. That's one. Do I go this one? Yeah do it. Yes okay. Owen, four. 1, 2, 3. Alright, what's your strategy. There's three balls that will get you out. I might go around the circle. I don't know we'll see. Starting there 1, 2, oh that's 3. I'm gonna go here, 4. 5, 6, 7, 8. *screams* You're out! I thought it was gonna go all around. She is out. We're down to the final three, the goat, the woat, and Owen. First one to land a cap on cap wins and the other two have to pick five cups each. Okay I'll go first. Yeah! Are you kidding me? 5 cups each. We're going to go one at a time, here we go. 1. 2. Okay one more each. Yes I'm safe, and Owen's safe! Take that Colin. Every time you miss a double flip, you have to pick a cup. I wish that counted but I'm going to have to do it again. That's one. 3 uh-oh. 5. You're in trouble dude. 8. 9. Okay nine cups for Owen. Oh that's one, Colin's finally picking. He only has to do one cup. Zero. Owen has to do 9, Colin 1, me none. Guys look at all the cups, it's like leaning Colin you only have to pick one so if you lose that would be a big fail. And I'm safe. Alright he's safe, Owen you pick 9. Alright that's 1, 2 3, woah, 4 5, 6, 7, 8, one more, 9. How did you do that? Guys look at all these cups that just fell. Oh, the cup tower fell that I just showed everyone. Next round you have to flip the bottle in the hoop and land it on the ground. Whoever doesn't score will have to pick three cups. Let's go! I'm him! Last round of the day, we both have to pick three cups, and then we'll finish the finals tomorrow, or whenever we're able to. No! Colin's out! No way. The one time I have to pick a cup I'm out? If I pick the ball Owen wins and I have to pick three cups. How did I lose? That's 1, 2. Okay last one, 3. It's me versus Owen in the finals, but guys Colin still has a chance to win cause we're throwing in a twist. Stay tuned. I have two ping pong balls. This one says Colin comes back and if you pick this one you're out, and I have to hide both of them. These are all the cups we have left. I want Colin to come back, I think that would be fun, so I'm going to put it in a spot I think people will guess, right in the middle. Meanwhile this ball, I'm going to put-just spell my name, T O M M Y. There it is. Now let's get the boys. We are back a couple weeks later me versus Owen, but Colin still has a chance to get in. There is one ball added that says Colin returns to the game, and whoever picks that will be out and replaced by Colin. Unless you pick the other ball, then you're First challenge of the day is to flip this bottle which has like no water in it and is very difficult. Owen you can go first. Whoever doesn't land it needs to pick a cup. No way what. Second try are you kidding me? Alright I get a chance to tie though I get a chance to tie. I am in danger now. If I pick the wrong cup I will be eliminated, and if I pick one specific cup then Colin will be back and I'll still be eliminated. Please no ball. Alright, we're safe. It is freezing cold and there's snow everywhere and we have to land a bottle on the arm of this freezing couch. We do have a couple arms to use if the snow all falls off. Alright Owen, please don't land it. Oh boy look at that. Now it's going to be impossible to land it there. Are you kidding me? This is going to be so difficult. Let's go! No way. Again? No way. I forgot to mention whoever loses this round has to pick three cups, so that means if I miss this I'm picking three cups. Here we go. No, are you kidding me? Darn it. Guys Colin might come back into this video if I pick a ball that says he's back, and I might lose if I pick the wrong one. We have 48 cups left and I have to pick three which means I have one in 16 chance of losing. Actually there's two balls so it's even worse than that. That's 1. 2. Alright one more one more. Should I go for this one? Yeah. Let's go! Next challenge is going to be right here. First one to flip it into the cup wins. Like this. Without having it fall over. Don't land it. Loser has to pick another 3 cups. First try! Since I made it first try I'm going to just go Are you kidding me, if I lose on So now both of you are picking. Owen's picking 3 and Matthew's picking 1. I bet you there's one in the middle cup. Tommy definitely put one in the middle cup so I'm not picking it. There you go, I'm safe. Alright Owen I dare you to pick it I dare you. Oh! Wait what does it say? Colin comes back! Colin, Colin's back! I called it. Look at this kid. I did put one in the middle cup. He's back, are you kidding me? Owen we're going to give you one chance to stay in the video. We gave Colin a second chance so that means we're going to give Owen a second chance. You have 3 tries to land a cap flip, if you don't, That's 1. No! No way are you kidding me? Alright we got So now all three of them are back in, and so I have to put one more ball I can see a trend here they all pick in the middle. Someone's definitely going to pick that one. Next round we're spinning the chair and whoever lands it on the arm first wins. Losers both have to pick 3 cups. Let's go! You both have to pick 3 cups right now. Alright who wants to go first? Oh-woah. Colin takes-oh, well that was fast. Owen 1. Oh, there was a ball! I didn't even see it! It's me versus Colin. So guys Tommy's been hiding the balls and he is going to change the cup that it's underneath right now. I don't know why but we have to leave and he's going to sneak around a little bit. Alright I want to change the location because I don't think people are going to pick where I put the ball. This is where it was. But look at, Colin picked these 3 in a row. Owen picked this one. They just love the middle. Right here. It just is, it's going to be picked. This might be the hardest shot of the video it's going to be a double cap flip. Like that. L. 3 cups. No, nope. Chance to tie chance to tie. Colin you're picking 3. 3 cups. I think the ball's underneath there. If you pick that you-oh. See it's not under there. Why would you go for the ones that you thought it was going to be under? Wait what. Reverse psychology. First to land it on the arm of the chair wins. Matthew's still going on the cap flip. I'll just make it. Chance to tie. Chance to tie. Dude I didn't even hit it. How many cups do you have to pick? I would have made it on the- You would have made it. I am predicting the ball is underneath that cup. So pick it. So I'm gonna pick one of the middle ones. That's 1. That's-NO! Another day, another victory for the OG!
