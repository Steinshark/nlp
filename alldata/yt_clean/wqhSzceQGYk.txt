The requirement for resurrection There's no resurrection In fact, Paul, I think, is havin' a little fun when he writes, in verse 36, &quot;Foolish one,&quot; he says, what you sow is not made alive I think Paul's kind of and saying, &quot;You know, You can't have a resurrection The first observation that he makes a little rebuke for his readers In essence, he's saying, &quot;Don't be ignorant There isn't really anything that until, first of all, you die.&quot; John 12:24, says this: unless a grain of wheat falls it remains alone, but if it dies, Paul's just laying for all of us who have such a hard time I mean, it's we call it the D-word. He says you shouldn't be you should embrace it because if you you can't have If it were somehow possible to live forever without dying, they would have to live forever What a horrible thought A man that I have for his writings is a guy named Dallas Willard. He tells the story of a woman who refused to talk She absolutely refused because she said she didn't want her children if it turned out Now, as Willard points out, no one will have with which to feel Think about that for a moment. &quot;On the other hand,&quot; &quot;if there is an afterlife, whoever enters may experience far more So as much as we don't like Paul helps us of a positive attitude about it and he says, about this new body but you have to understand, is you have to walk through unless you happen to be alive And we'll talk about that So much as we dislike Paul reminds us that, there is no resurrection. Now, the second thing he's gonna teach us is that the result is a different kind of body. Notice in verses 37 and 38, as you look down here in 1 Corinthians 15. He says, &quot;What you sow, you do not sow but mere grain-- perhaps wheat But God gives it a body to each seed its own body.&quot; Now, he is saying that the body is different from the body He's saying, if you put a kernel of corn in order for it to grow, what comes out of the ground It's a green stalk It's a part of the kernel. It represents the kernel, And Paul is saying to us, that, when we die and they go into the ground, they're gonna come than when they went in. We're not gonna have the same kind of body That's the whole purpose here with the Corinthians. The body that emerges is different from the body Now, we're all with the kind of bodies One of the most depressing that's communicated when I go to work out is the constant reminder that, the older you get, to maintain the same level as you used to get Does that depress I mean, here it is, and you need more you gotta take more just to stay even, And, you know, we're all and relatively we should be because this is the temple and we're supposed but how many will agree is gettin' to be Can I get a witness? Well, the apostle is gonna give in a broad outline that answers the very question What kind of body He describes of our resurrection body, and he contrasts it So notice letter A: our new bodies Our new bodies Verse 42, says it this way: &quot;So is the resurrection The body is sown--&quot; and when you see the word &quot;The body is buried it is raised in incorruption.&quot; &quot;The body is buried it is raised in incorruption.&quot; Now, friends, in the history in the history of time there's only been one body that has not been subject and that was the body The Psalmist, &quot;You will not leave nor will you allow to see corruption.&quot; There's only been one body Jesus was buried, he came out of the grave. His body had not seen The first thing about our new bodies-- to really encouraged us all. The first thing he teaches us is that it is not like Our present bodies wear out. The body we get, when we get is indestructible. Can I get a witness? I notice the older voices than the younger ones. Okay, number two, verse 43, our new bodies Now watch this, Paul says in verse 43, will be sown or buried but our new bodies Paul says that our new bodies The word, really, Some people even think may have a little glow to them. I don't know if that's true but that's maybe from this word. It is a glorious body of the risen Savior. Now, I want you to notice in what our bodies in all of the New Testament. It's Philippians chapter 3. I want us to read this Maybe we'll just read it in the same translation, Here we go. &quot;For our citizenship from which we also the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform that it may be conformed according to the working even to subdue Now, what does that verse about the kind of body Our body so that it is like the glorious body Now, go back to and notice it says, but it is raised in,&quot; &quot;It's raised in glory.&quot; The glory that the Lord Jesus the glory we're going to have when we are resurrected Now, when the apostle tells us we don't have to doubt &quot;Glory&quot; is the description Our new bodies just like the resurrected body This is what John when he writes to us He says, &quot;Beloved, now are we and it is not yet revealed but we know that when he &quot;We shall be like him, And Paul comes back at the end of his teaching Notice verse 49 &quot;As we have borne the image that's our current body, &quot;we shall also bear the image That's Jesus. Just like we now bear the image of our current body, one day, we're gonna bear We're gonna have I almost call this message I see all these books out there, One day, we're gonna have I'll tell you, whatever program you can just give it up That's the one. Now, you say, that's a great but what is 'body by Jesus'? What is the body by Jesus?&quot; Well, let me tell ya The only time that we the body by Jesus between and when he went back to heaven. And do you remember, we have a number of situations where Jesus expressed himself after he was resurrected And so, when we look we can learn some things and if our body is gonna be then we'll know what Are you with me? So let me just give you that I've observed during the 40 days between his Resurrection Number one, Jesus said He had a real body. Jesus said he had a real body. In Luke 24:39, &quot;Behold my hands and my feet, Handle me and see, for a spirit does not have as you see I have.&quot; What I want you you're not gonna have that floats around forever. Jesus said you're gonna have Did you hear what he said? He said, &quot;Handle me. My body is real.&quot; And a &quot;spirit body&quot; There isn't such a thing. If you have a body, And if you're in the spirit, Jesus's body was real, we're gonna have real bodies, like the body of the Lord Jesus when he was resurrected Jesus said his body was real. Notice, number two; this will greatly encourage Jesus ate on two occasions. I don't know if any questions &quot;Are we gonna eat in heaven?&quot; And so the thought, &quot;Well, we won't eat.&quot; Eating is not just but it's Can I get a witness? And some of you are already-- your mouths thinkin' about what I mean, I know. But I want you to notice Here again, this is Jesus Luke chapter 24, &quot;So they gave Jesus and some honeycomb. And he took it and he John 21:12 and 13, &quot;Jesus said to them, Yet none of the disciples knowing that it was the Lord. Jesus then came and took and likewise the fish,&quot; he ate breakfast All right, so we're gonna have We're gonna be able to eat. Notice the third thing: Jesus told Thomas Notice verse 27 of John 20: 'Reach your finger here, and reach your hand here, Do not be unbelieving, Once again, I wanna remind you after the extreme makeover, like our current bodies, resurrected, made over. We'll be able to eat. We will have the sense of touch. We know that Jesus told Mary Do you remember That happened John 20, verse 17. Jesus said to her, for I have not yet ascended You can't cling to something Jesus told Mary, 'cause I haven't yet ascended So people are always asking me, will people know me, Jesus, in his resurrection body, His disciples knew who he was. Listen to this: who was with them after his death was the very same Jesus they They knew this that they all went proclaiming the reality and that he came out the same Jesus who had gone but in his Resurrection body. He was the real Jesus, who they knew before and that's the way When you get to heaven, all the people that you and they're going to know you. It is unthinkable, to me, that in heaven we will know less 1 Corinthians 13:12, says this: &quot;For now we see in a mirror, Now I know in part, but then I We will have a greater sense than we've ever had Well, our new bodies Our new bodies Our new bodies, and I mean that, incredible. Verse 43b, says, we will be raised in power.&quot; We will be buried in weakness, When a body is buried, it's without any strength, but when we come it will be in power. In our current bodies, to sustain effort for very long. Isn't that true? It gets harder and harder We work hard for a few hours But in our new bodies, we will have capacities without any limitation. Nothing will be outside the scope in our new body. On one occasion-- On one occasion, without going through the door. He just appeared John 20, verse 19, says, being the first day of the week, where the disciples for fear of the Jews, and said to them, In Jesus's resurrection body, he surmounted Earth had no power to stop him, and our bodies Finally, our bodies indestructible and identifiable but notice the fourth thing Our new bodies will be infinite. &quot;It is buried a natural body, There is a natural body, Paul goes to great effort between our earthly body He points to Adam as the image bearer He points to Christ for our new body. He says that we are going Now, let me just talk with you because this is a matter for a lot of God's people. What is a spiritual body? He's not talking about We already know He was handled. Jesus did not have a, quote, unquote, He had a material body, and we're gonna have So we're not gonna have in the sense that we're gonna be if you know what I mean. We're gonna have real bodies. Paul is talking here that is no longer controlled but a real body that is now controlled Our new bodies will exist and our new bodies, instead of being governed will be governed That's what a spiritual body is. The basic difference between a natural body is that the former body is suited for life and our spiritual bodies for life in heaven The natural body The spiritual body And Paul tells us we could not live in heaven. Verse 50 of chapter 15, that flesh and blood cannot inherit nor does corruption He is saying that, as we are now we couldn't function but God is gonna give us new, like the ones we have, only completely made over, and no longer governed but governed now Do you understand about trying to take people You know what, what God has planned So I'm gonna ask you today, you can think of why your trust in Jesus Christ?
