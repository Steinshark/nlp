This is the dumbest thing we've ever done! It's like a giant cotton bud! This is literally called the Toe of Satan. My tongue's gone numb. Wo....Okay. Hi, I'm Josh. I'm Ollie. And today we are gonna be making The world has ever seen. That's what this thing is! Yeah! So... Woah, that thing is spinning fast! The first one. Jolly Rancher! I like what you did there! Alright. So this is very hot. Woah! Put it in. It's sizzling. I didn't even know Wow, it's shaking quite a lot. Oh, my gosh! Woahhhh! Can you see that? That is super cool! I can't believe this is actually working Ollie! I was fully expecting this to not remotely work. It's like a giant cotton bud! That is so cool. People are coming up. Staff are coming up the stairs just to marvel at this. Look at that! Let's try. Does it taste like Jolly Rancher? It's so sweet. Oh, my gosh. Leave some for me! Woah! Oh my gosh. That's so sweet. It's so sweet. It's also kind of sour. I don't think I've ever realised that Candy floss, or cotton candy, Or 'barbe a papa', the French. Daddy's beard. - No! It's kind of insulting to dentists Like every dentist I've ever had Next up, we have... Warheads. Ohhh, this feels dangerous. Super sour cotton candy. It's melting already! You can see... Wow, this one's producing a lot of floss! It's more wispy than the Jolly Rancher. Shall I see if I can get some? - Oh, there we go! I need to turn faster? Yeah. Yes! YES! OK, OK. Calm down. Is it gonna be sour? One of the things I have suspected about sour sweets, Is it's all in the coating. As soon as you get past that stuff on the So maybe that melted away, Let's try. Oh... That is the weirdest candy floss I've ever had. Gosh. Ah! My ears! Ah, I'm getting cramp! There's a reason they don't sell this. Oh! It's gone straight That is an intense experience though. That is really intense. That's why you get sour sweets, right? It's for the visceral experience. I'm salivating so much. - You ate all of that? It's so sour! So we've done Jolly Ranchers . We've done Warheads. - Yeah... You can get some pretty weird Weirder than Warheads? Oh, Josh... - Josh, Josh, Josh, Josh, Josh... Where have we gone now? I found pickle flavoured hard candies. If this works we can make Does it smell like pickle? - Smells like pickle juice. The world's first pickle cotton candy. Now, we should try this with an open mind. A lot of foods you don't think would work. The sweet savoury crossover. But then sometimes they do. - This is more than I was expecting it... It's never stopping! My brain is literally... I feel like it's being rebooted. That is so weird. - It's not disgusting. I'm so confused by that. Wait, does anyone wanna try this? - No. - No? - You should. - Immediately was like, &quot;Nooo.&quot; Now, we're doing... Cinnamon. - Ohh, cinnamon candy. - OK. Can you actually stand back a little bit? Woah! Woah! Woah! OK, we should only use two! OK, no. We need to smash them. - This is why I got the hammer. - Nah, it'll be fine, it'll be fine. What do you mean? Because two of them Oh. They're too round OK. It's hammer time. Shut up. Wow! It instantly smashes. I think this could work, right? Because cinnamon toast works, Cinnamon rolls work. It complements sweet flavours quite well. - I'm terrified. I'm so scared. There's no floss being formed. Is this candy too hard? Why is there nothing happening? Why is this more worrying than OK, this is really, really unnerving. How long is this gonna take? Oh! Oh! We got some floss action. It's forming around the sides here. There we go. Floss Master General over here. - Floss Master General! My dentist is gonna be livid! Holy moly! - This is working really well! I've got cramp in my arm Does it smell good? Oh my gosh.
