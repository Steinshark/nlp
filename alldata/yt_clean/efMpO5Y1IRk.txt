We got visual confirmation Commander Moore and You're the commanding officer Okay, don't take anything Keep your head on a swivel. But the Megalodon It appears to be and its movements You and the other Marines make good and sure We've got to get her Aye, sir. I'll bring her in. [tense music playing] [no audible dialogue] [sighs] Crew of the USS<i> King...</i> this is Lieutenant Commander <i> The Megalodon is dead, <i> Captain Lynch <i> have lost their lives <i> I am your new <i> and I'm gonna do <i> to make sure we all <i> All able-bodied crew,</i> <i> please tend to the damage I'm sending out and I'm setting up <i> Semper fi!</i> - Oo-rah! [sighs] You okay? Who cares? Jones, Tilkian, they're all dead. But so is that Meg. That's something, right? [tense music playing] SHARP:<i> It's back! - [screams] [rifles firing] [sighs] [thrilling music playing] <i> Attention, crew.</i> <i> Will all engineers Wow. Welcome aboard the CRATUS, Oh, um, Dr. Clark. You picked Oh, it's an honor to meet you. I'm just--I'm such I've read all of your research. Oh, thank you, one arm at a time And you can call me Riley. Thank you, Doctor-- Ah! - Riley. Don't forget, thousands of students from around the world and your geothermal engineering That means so much. Thank you. I'm just--I'm so grateful You know, you've been my whole career, with your and heading this entire project. And when you started tapping to fuel this entire planet. Well, right now, we're at the beginning but as soon as we launch, When CRATUS II I knew I had to be It's incredible studying deep-sea life but also tapping into a potentially limitless You want to take a look? Yeah. Is that Volcano 6 Yes, it is. It's been single-handedly supplying geothermal energy via a mail-well pipe, Phases One through Three involved getting from her original function Now we've gone fully and we're Is that part of Phase Four? Mm-hmm. That phase is CRATUS II. It's a fully operational energy harvester It's continually providing renewable and clean energy Our goal is to have CRATUS II be fully operational You know, And is it gonna be online today? - Yes, it is. That's why We're gonna have you managing at the flip of a switch. Congratulations. Thanks so much. This way. Hey, Kurt. How's it going? Afternoon, Dr. Clark. Just putting on this long-range remote that should work underwater Great. Now, what about Well, that's up next. to get those things so I'll be tackling that Now, we can't operate Oh, I know. You must be Dr. London. It's just Ms. London, I'm not a doctor until Kurt Holt member of our team. You are. You take care of the station, you take care of us, and he has saved us She's being far too generous. She asks me to fix something, Well, it's great to meet you. Likewise. We ready to launch? Yeah, fully functional. Great. I am going to hand I'm gonna go finish up I will see you guys in the sub. Copy that. Okay. KRISTY: All right. Yeah, Brunson has Bring me up to speed Flyovers detected no further so they signaled we're clear to Should be able Okay, we can make do Sir, we're down The hull but luckily, we're taking Copy that, Tolbert. Damn it. Anything else? Sir, engines took We're currently operating Sonar and radar are kaput. Our large guns and The long-range radio but we're trying What about fuel? We're at 50%, all within acceptable Yeah, that should be enough We gotta get At least near enough ship-to-shore assistance. Tolbert, you give that engine Of course, sir. with the tools and supplies Anything we can do even a little faster is gonna Any breaches in the hull, seal it off, secure it. We've gotta get You with me? Copy that, sir. Okay. Hoskins, Used up a whole lot of ammo before it was finally Short- and long-range rounds Some of our depth charges We lost So we're at 50% there, too. The<i> King</i> is That's about Thank you for your work, Are we all stowed - Yes, sir. Son, I want you You spot anything you alert me - Crystal clear, sir. Hoskins... grab your rifle. We're not taking any chances. [sighs] Dr. Clark, we have will connect Volcano 6 Yeah. Uh, the submersible is outfitted This is gonna be I'm gonna be in constant Welcome to your first mission. Thank you so much. All of this, and you You're amazing. [laughs] Not so amazing. I was brought up on the water. My father was an admiral. I just graduated from I wanted to take the laser out, but she won the arm-wrestling - gets to go take it out time. You can drive the submersible So you say. Okay, I think I'm off. All right. Hey. We have live feed so anything you need, just ask. I know. [systems whirring] Power on. Power at 100%. Oxygen on. Oxygen 100%. Lights on. Controls operational. Laser fusion drill <i> Prepare to dive on my mark.</i> Copy that. Standing by. 3, 2, 1... mark. [engines whirring] Sub is away. We'll be at our location soon. Copy that. Everything's showing A-okay Step one complete. [soft music playing] <i> Continuing descent. [music building] [exhales] <i> Thermal vents are coming into Sub is in position.

This is just incredible. I was just sitting in Advanced Geothermal Systems and now I get to see it [chuckles] Well, wait 'til they see this. KURT:<i> All right, Doc...</i> <i> slow and steady.</i> I know, I know. I want to get this right. I don't want to have <i> Fusion drill's powered on.</i> <i> Initiating dig.</i> [energy surges] And we are at 1/2 kilometer. <i> We are at 2 kilometers.</i> 2 1/2 kilometers. Kurt, what's going on? Uh, I-I can't get it to link. Running diagnostics now. 3 1/2 kilometers. Kurt. We're approaching CRATUS II is still offline. <i> We should have <i> to geothermal direct energy Find anything you can about Got it. KURT:<i> Our scans are showing <i> between one <i> Nothing unusual on our end. Keep looking. [sighs] Um... try running a scan There must be We're at 4 1/2 kilometers. <i> We're at 5 kilometers.</i> <i> Contact!</i> [rumbling] There it is. But we may have opened a sizable fissure <i> about 250, There's no volcanic or but let's keep Copy that. Running assessments on and the possible [instruments beep] Um... Dr. Clark? We've lost visual. Come in. - [static crackles] Hey, Kurt. Kristy? Is everything okay? It should be. Might have just lost juice I'll get her back. Kurt, Kristy, can you hear me? What's that? [steady beeping] Sonar is showing a huge blip, but there shouldn't be anything Dr. Clark, there's something there, Could just be interference, but whatever it is, Over. [static crackles] Kurt, Kristy, can you hear me? Do you hear me? Oh! I think comms are back! - KURT:<i> Dr. Clark?</i> Did you see that? Dr. Clark, did you Based on its movements I-I would think it was a shark. <i> It's agitated.</i> <i> The drill must have Oh. But you did an environmental There should be of that size down there. Riley, get back to CRATUS now. [dramatic music playing] Kurt, what is this thing?! Kristy, what do you see? <i> We see it on the scanner,</i> <i> and it's still <i> You have to try and lose it!</i> <i> This thing is huge! Get back to CRATUS A.S.A.P. I can't shake it. KRISTY:<i> All right, <i> Whatever it is, do it fast!</i> Um, try using Maybe you can and get a chance to get away. <i> Worth a shot. Dr. Clark? Can you read me? Dr. Clark? I'm here. I-- I think I hit it but I can't be sure. <i> I think it's still out there.</i> <i> You should be able Let's see. Um... our scanners say but just try to get up here, and w-we'll hopefully <i> Checking CRATUS II status.</i> CRATUS II is offline. [instruments beeping] We're confirming that I'm so sorry. I'm resurfacing. We'll have to figure out how to get but keep your eye <i> That thing is still out there.</i> <i> I never want to see it again.</i> [dramatic music playing] <i> Over 100 feet. <i> They're saying <i> All right, well, <i> Roger.</i> <i> Looks totally clear. You?</i> <i> Nothing on the sonar.</i> [helicopter blades thrumming] <i> Copy. Let's head up the coast.</i> <i> Last sighting was off Onofre.</i> Dr. Clark, are you okay? We can get you Oh! Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine. Good call on that laser drill. [sighs] Yeah. - Kurt. Can we get Dr. Hilton You got it. Thanks. So what did Well, according to the sonar, the object was approximately and it was fast. It never slowed or stopped. Whatever it was, Just as you made contact a blip showed up on the screen. Huge. Just out of nowhere We confirmed with sonar. According to Kurt, 200 feet? What kind of shark Dr. Clark... Kurt just told me Yeah. - At depth? Well, I guess to be seen Look, I know it sounds strange, but I've never It was enormous. We did an environmental It did not show in this zone of that size or any of the zones How big did you say It was approximately 187 feet. The blip was huge. Wait. Earlier this morning, there was a daily briefing saying that there was No, they called it But if that first one's [chuckles] Look, the largest great white is just over 20 feet long. Now, I think what you and at that depth, for it to be a filter feeder. And even so, of the reading you're claiming I know what I saw. It was in my face. Okay? It came right at me. This was not a blue whale. I didn't see baleen. I saw thousands It was a shark. The only shark that's the same size is the<i> Otodus</i> Megalodon, and all of our research that that was extinct This thing came right at me and tried to take I nearly crashed the craft What about the CRATUS II? Well, we're recharging It's gonna take a few hours, but once we'll take another stab If there is a Megalodon it's gonna cause both micro and macro. There could be and we just unleashed it. Anything of that size presents an immediate threat the well pipe Look, we gotta figure out make sure it doesn't come back. We gotta plug that hole up 'cause if there's But the only equipment It's still charging up. It's not gonna The only thing that we is to close those floodgates. We've got to protect this team. All right. I'm on it. Follow me. Captain! I see a large object heading directly towards us. Fin in the water! <i> You seein' what we're seeing</i> <i> from the bow, Captain?</i> That shark was dead. I got a visual Get ready, Marines. <i> Big guns are down, <i> Improvise, adapt, Hold a steady course, Brunson. I don't want to have reason Aye, sir. Loud and clear. Crew! Do not fire -<i> I don't want us wasting ammo. Copy that. - Oo-rah! Eyes up, Marines! All hands! [both scream] All right, I'll let you know when there's We've got sonar here, too, but we've also got Rig If there's anything in the area, this will find it. If this thing is really... 200 feet long... it'll show up here. Just let me dial it in So what do we do Well, we get it We can't afford any setbacks. How? I may be but I don't exactly to secure a 200-foot Megalodon. Then we'll figure We're not gonna let it or hurt somebody. Can you widen the range? Sure. No problem. Three-mile radius. Still nothing. Well, maybe it swam away. But where could it have gone? All right, they can swim and at that massive size, they can cover a lot It's vital to the survival that we find this thing And, uh--[laughs] Hey, if this is real, I guess I'd like You know... morbid curiosity. Trust me. You don't. [tense music playing] Hoskins! You have eyes on it? It's back below, sir! Depth charges port side! Now! Aye, sir. Hurt it with both charges! - Hurt it bad! We nearly emptied our entire Stay ready. Captain, we need backup Ammo is low, Coast Guard and Navy are getting They need assistance and evac. They will aid us but unarmed civilians - You got me? Okay, give me sit-rep. Negative. It's got a few of us. Richardson, Smith, Dented up the port side Can't repair that Sir, that was the last one But it looked at least for now, sir. Well, hopefully that they'll think twice That sucker was even bigger It was like, what, 200 feet? Ship is 600 feet. Damn thing was Well, the smaller one I'm gonna try I need the two of you to keep your eyes glued You so much as glimpse - you let everybody know. Clear? 'Cause if it and we're not ready, [tense music playing] Officer on deck! Come on, man. You know Whatever you say, sir. You know, they have me You know, Glad to have you back, It's good to be back. - [static crackles] <i> This is Lieutenant <i> of the USS</i> King on a heading for Jalisco.

There must be. Even though Megalodons are fast, there's no way that distance in that time. We have to warn them. [sonar beeps] Look! This one's It's--It's in the middle. There's more than two. I'll go below deck, shut the floodgates. Maybe we can block 'em out. We need to get eyes on it. It was south-southwest. Eyes up, people. On alert. Fin in the water! [tense music playing] Oh, my. It's remarkable. The only way to stop this We need to know Everyone be on alert <i> Kurt, it's Riley. Come in.</i> How are we coming Just give me As soon as you can, <i> 60 seconds at most.

Activated floodgates. Again. Kurt, it's coming back! It's gonna hit Gates are going down soon. That should protect us Wait! Wait! Stop the gate! Doctor, what? Just for a second. No. That's what's Hilton, the floodgates go clear down to the drill site, Yes, correct. It's a precaution in case there's an energy bleed If it gets trapped in we could buy a little time to learn how to deal No, no. That will That thing could tear down and us with it. We need to observe it. But having that thing You all saw what that Megalodon If it's allowed to swim free, Yes, we're scared now, but how are we gonna feel We don't want As much as I hate the idea you're right. that it'd be to study a real Megalodon We can figure out Fine. Let's trap it, then. But how are we gonna to make sure We only have one shot at this. No... but the sharks are drawn It's how they stalk their prey. If we could electrify with enough magnetism, Basalt. It's a molten rock. And considering literally directly beneath us, I would bet is covered with it, and it's conductive. We can use that think there's food down there. Kurt, come in. I need for you to electrify We're drawing the Megalodon in. If I disconnect the mini-sub, drop the power cord that should give us And I mean small. That's ingenious. Anything will do. And it has to happen now, Copy that. Look at that incredible size. Kurt, now! [new alarm bell ringing] All right. He isn't happy Okay, I think this Megalodon's We can assume it's strong, but is it strong enough to dislodge I don't think so. We've got a deep and extremely It's got a seismic four rating. These hits to the floodgates shouldn't cause Okay, well, but how do we get out? It's not like The well pipe. [chuckles] I can't believe I don't think the Megalodon It goes several kilometers deep. Yes. However, through the well pipe due to the drill today. And it's building up If that pressure it could feed back to the CRATUS and That could be devastating. That pressure builds the well it could unleash right along the fault line. What happens if the well pipe Well, the worst... the very worst, is that it could create We're gonna Right. [dramatic music playing] We've been out here Hold. Hold. It's big, huge! Those are blues.

A shark just showed up and killed a dozen people and then went back didn't stay in the shallows. I wonder [tense music playing] [instruments beeping] Oh. Wait a minute. Hello? Hello? Yes! Helmut, no, we're okay. We--Okay. Okay. We understand. Got it. [line beeps] That was the CEO The company that funded You've done your homework. Yes, I have. Well, Quasar said they're and the Coast Guard like the<i> Fragasso</i> said. But the<i> Fragasso</i> and the<i> King</i> are the only rescue ships out and they said we might need as soon as we can. And I agree. That tsunami cannot happen. Well, the only way is if a massive force were to just But we've stress tested it against anything But we've never Even so, a Megalodon We can handle that. We just have to hope Right. We should disconnect But without CRATUS II we, uh... we would have I hate to say that, but it [chuckles] Yeah. Well, when this we didn't compensate for prehistoric sharks So how do we do that? Just take the pipe offline? Well, there is a shut-off line, You'd have to get in the water [sighs] Well, let me lift So we're gonna so it can do more damage? That's the reason we trapped it We know the Megalodon to at least The sheer size would send the Megalodon racing towards it So that's our choice. We keep it in here with us when we have to take or release it where it's guaranteed to Great choice. We're still Are you sure you're Captain Keele, and it's still our duty <i> Shouldn't be too long now.</i> <i> Over.</i> Captain, we have a sighting We may have I'll catch you up after Over and out.

Yeah, get us any way you can. We're the only ones who Aye, sir. Son of a gun. DR. HILTON: and it turns out that, according to the Navy these aren't with Megalodons There have been The first instance The USS<i> Shaw</i> discovered that was trying to break into and, in doing so, they Captain Streeper along with Admiral King, managed to subdue the Russians but not before the Admiral and many of their crew The second incident I wonder if it's the same ship According to reports, Commander Moore managed to take another one out after they intercepted I suppose that's a good sign that they can help Before they get here, a once-in-a-lifetime The opportunity to examine It's a terrifying dream Well, our Megalodon is and she's pretty pissed off. If that rage she could take a run creating a tsunami, which is the very last thing We don't know We're gonna have to come up Well, what kind of plan? Well, we know there have been at least three to four within the vicinity of our dig. Multiple Megalodons, causing incredible damage It could be hunting. Yeah, but... this station, and this crater was excavated so why now? [scoffs] Of course. [chuckles] What are the two things especially oceanic predator, is particularly more than anything? Their hunting grounds... and... And what? Their breeding grounds. The blood spotting I thought at first some stray gore but... it's in keeping This Megalodon... is pregnant. It's spawning? Well, no wonder They see everything We're positioned directly over It's some in all of the Pacific Ocean. We have an abundance rich in flora and fauna, and it's all being cultivated the area surrounding it. It's within reason been creating And the Megalodons Well, we're closed in with one, and she's pissed. These Megalodon sightings, they may have been of females coming to breed and males So the males looking for predators. To a Megalodon, a Navy ship definitely Dr. Hilton, that this is [sighs] Well, um, judging by the Megalodons' increasingly aggressive without reasonable doubt, that is a pregnant Megalodon. Well, how many pups in its gestation period? Sharks can spawn up to two if they don't eat each other And some species But we--we don't Megalodon reproduction. The only fossils are those of their teeth. So what you're saying is with three of these things and the possibility And if they become they're coming The well pipe, as well. Then we have to go down And we've got to get rid of as many of them for our safety What would happen were perceived as being Well, the males, they would a-and try to protect them. What if we were able to draw away somehow bring them set off a controlled explosion, taking them out, the station... And all of us as well. Yeah, we-- we can't just go off They--They were previously We need to study them. They're not your friends, okay? We've got to find a way protect our team. That is job one. Are we clear? Yes, crystal... Dr. Clark. the USS<i> King</i> into this region We can use the ship and the sub to try to move them No--What about the well? We cannot set off until this well is turned off. Unless we want in the middle One of us will have down to the well, decouple the well pipe from the rest of the equipment. But we need to get to work unless the Marines <i> Apparently there <i> as far down <i> And not blue whales,</i> <i> but 200-foot what looks <i> Unbelievable.</i> <i> Wait, 11 o'clock! My Lord, that has to be it. Dropping for a better look. All right, men. I'm gonna take one last sweep Aye, sir. How are we feeling, Marines? Hanging in there, Cap. We're still leaking oil and we're down But we're staying frosty, sir. Staying frosty. That's what I like to hear. Go on, man. Show him. I've been working on something. Show me. During my stint in the Gulf, I picked up a few tricks. IEDs, like frag bombs. Something like that. Bit more powerful The lightweight materials the ability You wouldn't want to get caught You would not. The best I could do Don't be modest, man. These bad boys are beautiful. - [chuckles] ball bearings, nuts, washers, and some other pointy bits I figured we don't need - at this point. I noticed our bullets didn't but maybe if we could punch You did a damn fine job, We're gonna use those. But be smart. Pick your spots. - Will do, Captain. We get to the station, If we don't move fast-- - [wave splashes] Stations! Tolbert, stand by Don't toss one 'til Yes, sir. Okay, aim. Steady. Steady. Fire! Damn it! Tolbert, stay ready You see that thing?! Negative! Nothing to port! Now, Tolbert! Eyes? Negative! Anyone have eyes on it? Negative! Fore and aft! See if you can spot it! Everyone okay?! We're fine. Engine's offline, Cap! Can we fix it? I'll get on it now, We still got a few miles Brunson, check the engine! Tolbert, Hoskins, keep all eyes If this thing turns back Yeah. CRATUS, this is the USS<i> King.</i> Our engine's been hit. But we're working <i> Last we saw, it was <i> so be on the lookout We're going to be to you Stand by, Captain. We've got plan B. Over. I'm all ears. We're gonna take Then we're gonna [chuckles] Good deal. Okay, everyone, We're gonna do it like this. Everyone else has been so it's up to us One, I'm gonna be taking Two, we're gonna get We're gonna line Three, we raise the floodgates Four, we get Five, we use to explode CRATUS II and hopefully take Everybody know what to do? All right, to get your belongings We're gonna meet We've got three minutes. Who did you say was gonna I will take the mini-sub, and I will turn - No. I'll do it. You're way too important - We can't do it without you. Dr. Clark, this is your project. They're gonna need you You need this fixed, yeah? Let me fix it for you. Okay. Well, how close are we to figuring out how By changing the frequency of our radio signal we will cause caused by It'll be sent underwater. It's the same way that we only this way so it'll travel further. Once we do that, will be drawn to its source, especially if they think is in any sort of danger. This should also keep in the area for us. Well, downside is, they're gonna be Be prepared for that. What if the station How do you keep Well, the station if the volcano goes dormant or if the station so I think we'll be fine. What did you say If my calculations are correct, enough to lure would give us How soon will it be ready? It's rigged up. I had to make but we're good to go. Engaging signal. [equipment chimes] Is it working? - [rumble] - Okay, turn that thing off. We want to give Kurt as he can possibly have Kristy, You've got It will show us where for maximum efficiency. Uh, Hilton, rest of your data. We've got to head down Okay, let's go. Kurt. I want you on that headset Okay. [tense music playing] Okay. - Okay, come on. There. [device beeping] Headed towards the valve. What's the status All good, thanks to Oh, I'm sure you but just wanted to make sure you have all You just pay attention You know what's out there. Copy that. Headed to lower depths now. - Okay. just to be safe. We don't have anything left. We--Our materials are shot. We gotta sync Okay. How you doing down there, Kurt? [devices beeping] Located the valve. Now I just need and I'll be Come on. Come on. KRISTY: Do we have any more? We're almost there. It's the last one. Just plant 'em. I'll sync 'em. - Okay. You got it. Kurt, are you there? [pressure hisses] Got it. Valve is deactivated. I repeat, valve is deactivated. Now you can... You got it. You got it. [both yelp] You guys okay up there? I'm on my way back now. We're okay. Okay. I'm coming in, Make sure the access bay We only got one shot at this. I know. Come on, baby. Come on, baby. It's open, Kurt! It's open! We have to go. We have to go. [device beeping] Ah, come on. Come on, baby. Come on, man. Come on. Come on! <i> Kurt, are you there?! Kurt?!</i> [gasps] Kurt, please answer. Kurt, please answer. Kurt, come in. Kurt, come in. [static crackles] I'm so sorry, but we You're right. We're running out of time. HILTON:<i> I'm at the sub. [sighs] Everybody okay? - All in one piece? Okay, we're all here. Ah, good. Okay. A-Are you sure you don't Oh, God. You've already done If it weren't for you, Thank you. [sighs] Of course. Now, Dr. Hilton, this is We're gonna raise we're gonna release and we're gonna Good. Looking forward Yeah. Yeah. Let's get this done. Okay. Everyone secure? As secure as we're gonna be. Here we go. I'm gonna set it off We don't know They move fast. They're gonna keep following We've gotta be able to act so you've gotta - Ohh! Hit that detonator. [warning beeps] What happened? It's not linking. Kristy. I-I didn't link it. Uh... What? Kristy, I told you. I'm sorry. We were-- and it was an emergency, and-- Anyone have eyes There's nothing on this side. Kristy, is there any way to get that detonator working? Kurt gave you We have got to sink the CRATUS. Dr. Clark, I left the binder I'm so sorry. No, no, no, no! We have to get out of here. Hold on. Evasive maneuvers, now! Hold on! [engines whirring] Uh, still nothing, Dr. Clark. Okay, give me a minute. Let me think. Maybe if we-- and sneak through a gap they'll get stuck Or--Or at least I can't think We're gonna have to do it. There. That's the only gap Looks awfully tight. Just trust me. I drew up the blueprints We can fit. All right. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. [both laughing] Wait. Wait. What's that? Please tell me those No. Those are its pups. The Megalodon gave birth. [gasps] [pounds roof] DR. CLARK:<i> This is <i> Please answer if you can. This is the<i> King.</i> Over. Captain Sharp, of the CRATUS on the sub. We have five One of them gave birth. We're covered We're trying to shake them now. One of them gave birth. <i> And these things <i> but they're 20 feet long, Well, why are they following I'm not sure. We're the only thing Okay, what about Remote detonation didn't work. We need these things We've got to bring <i> And we can't Not without getting and it's not an option. Oh, man. What kind of distraction These Megalodons, the biggest thing in the area. If you could get they may just peel off. <i> We've got to get them <i> draw them in.</i> <i> Sync it up with the CRATUS,</i> <i> with the blast from the sub,</i> sync the explosion, and then get and take 'em down We'll make it happen. Please hurry. Brunson, how we looking?! I think we're ready, sir. Okay, Marines, toward the CRATUS now. The scientists need to rig the station to blow, and we have to get to buy them We know what that means, and we're ready. I need to know We're going into something <i> Semper fi,</i> Cap. We gotta try to let And if that means then we gotta be the bait. Hoo-rah, sir! Oo-rah! Oo-rah! It's been an honor, men. Tolbert, get whatever and rig this whole sip to blow. Just in case. Time's a-wastin'. Let's go to work! Cap, heads up! Okay, Dr. Clark. There's your window. There's nothing on the sonar. Are we clear? I think they're gone. I think the distraction worked. Let's find a way [alarms ringing] Hold! Hold! Fire at will! [yelling] [gasps] Stand your ground, Marines! Make 'em work for it! [screams] [gunfire] No looking back now, Marines. If they're still fighting, Come on! You got - Let me get-- Okay. Let me just try - Hurry. - [tapping] Ah, come on. Okay, here goes. [warning beeping] [groans] Is there Wh-What about the laser drill? Drill's only at 50% power. But we've gotta take the shot. Kristy, What's the focal point I need? There. There, the intersection If we can punch a hole it should bring No, with us There's no time. I'm starting with the laser. You rewire - Okay. the remote frequency until - [energy surging] What if the laser doesn't work? Then I'm gonna right through the station. MARINE: I'm out! [groans] I'm out, too! Hang on, Tolbert! Okay, you sons of bitches! Come and get me! Aiming at the weak point now. How are we looking, Dr. Clark? Not good. With the laser it's gonna take a few minutes. Sonar's picking up shapes We haven't turned off We must be Oh, come on. They're coming in fast! How do we get out of here or caught in that explosion? We have to blow it up now. Wait. Wait. combined with the explosion, Worth a shot. Everyone, hang on. [dramatic music playing] Okay. [detonator beeps] Uplink! The signal is good! Hit it, Kristy! [detonator beeps] [laughing] Ohh! Ohh! Dr. Hilton, damage report. We're breached Our oxygen supply our laser's broken - Engines? No, the engines are fine. Nothing to report right now. Anybody see any signs? Any signs of them? I'm not seeing How 'bout you? No, not over here, either. We actually managed We may have. We just may have. But the sub We gotta find some land. We gotta find some land and wait it out I know a place. You know, we're never Except Captain Sharp. Lot of good people died And Kurt. Without them, But we did make it. We did make it. We made it. [laughs] Hey, I think I see a ship. Hey! Over here! Over here! [laughs] What? What--We're here. Oh! Oh, God, thank you! Thank you! [laughing] We're safe! Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you.
