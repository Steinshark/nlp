Deltas, marshland, rivers, are essential links between aquatic They're the great wetlands. Cradles of incredible biodiversity, they play a vital ecological role An exceptional array of flora However, living in these wetland worlds The powerful water cycle rains over these zones On the Bay of Fundy in Canada, tracking the rhythm of the tides from ocean depths to far inland regions. Here, thriving fauna and flora In addition to these gigantic tides, which are on average five times higher factors in the harsh Canadian climate. In winter, blocks of ice It's another challenge for the wild flora However, when spring arrives, indispensable to the survival Situated on the eastern coast of Canada the Bay of Fundy is a sea arm and 80 kilometers wide. Since time immemorial, Fundy Bay has been subject to a phenomenon It endures the world's highest tides, which are between 14 and 16 meters high. Twice a day, 100 billion tons of water at an average speed The water thrust into this funnel The oceanic wave takes on speed and is projected The powerful waves, provoke a tidal bore This countercurrent phenomenon Every 27 days, at each lunar revolution, In early spring, the coastal forests, affected by the cool surface waters are frequently wrapped in fog. At the heart of the misty forest With the return of good weather, a family of beavers It's time for these engineers and consolidate their dams Thanks to the vast aquatic zones the beavers and their public works They're particularly well-adapted Their ears and nostrils close They can hold their breath A fine membrane protects their eyes, and the flat hairs of their fur The sun-strewn, make a good environment that moose enjoy eating. In March, spring gently settles on Fundy Bay As early as April, the light becomes more present It houses peat bogs, marshy prairies of soil of decomposing vegetal matter, In this very acidic ecosystem, only a specific type Among them is the Drosera. This tiny plant makes dew in soil It's found a ruse It's carnivorous. Its large leaves have long tentacles with ends bearing a viscous that resembles drops of dew or nectar. Once a fly, mosquito, or bee lands on it, it sticks and becomes entangled Digestion will take a few days. In a nearby prairie, the yellow goldfinch a sign that spring has truly arrived. These first seeds, rich in lipids, to feed and raise her offspring, well hidden in a cozy nest For millions of years, With these ebbs and flows, like here at Hopewell Rocks. Simple rocky islets at high tide, they transform These rocky peaks are an ideal refuge that keep a watchful eye from afar their progeny. This little raptor He makes his parents well aware of it. Just a few weeks old, he's already started losing This young falcon was born in May where the Mi'kmaq Indian tribe are the work of the divinities According to their tale, the beaver, obeying the god Glooscap built a dam. The whale, however, refusing to let the tidal currents destroyed the dam This gesture caused such a disturbance that the water continues The Bay of Fundy of the humpback whale, the rare right whale, However, now they're threatened and pollution. Moira Brown, a biologist, studies these animals What we saw here was the first surfacing after they had been down The first surfacing I guess they need a breath. Now they're very mellow at the surface. It must be a bit of rest time There's the fluke. That's the fingerprint for the rest of their lives. Two of those whales from what looks like entanglement scars. Breach! To see the whole body is spectacular. The Bay of Fundy for many different species not just North Atlantic right whales, and more recently, sperm whales. There's so much food in the Bay of Fundy. The result is that the visibility because the water is so full of food. Plankton, phytoplankton, and zooplankton, that's what the fish are after, The area of the Bay of Fundy is called the Grand Manan Basin. It's the deepest part The right whales come here to feed. They feed on plankton called copepods. This is a plankton Right whales grow quite large, This is where the plankton by virtue of a tidal gyre. It's because the movement that you get those cold, productive waters It's like a giant washing machine. Its perpetual movement once again for just a few hours. It's June, Inside the bay at Mary's Point the outgoing tide of several square kilometers. The mud here is unique. It's a precise recipe of liman and sand. In summer, and a tiny invertebrate The mud shrimp. For this little crustacean, the most difficult part of the year They're the staple food Greater yellowlegs, semipalmated plovers, and other waders to delight in this microfauna. At the beginning of summer, hundreds of these tiny birds and descend on the area. They take possession of the bay and gorge themselves on crustaceans. At the mouth of the bay the marine vegetation has had to adapt These rocks an algae firmly attached to its host It lives to the rhythms submerged every six hours before finding itself high It's subjected to dehydration, Low tide reveals of the abundance of life at Fundy. Simple mud puddles. Exposed to the rays of the sun, making conditions optimal and growth of plants, These puddles are a refuge These microorganisms They're part of the plankton, anemones, nudibranchs, and ascidians. Benefiting from the ideal conditions krill larvae have proliferated. Despite their small size, these shrimp are essential to the survival Early July, humpback whales and their calves They've traveled 3,000 kilometers They can weigh more than 30 tons In order to offer they must devour two tons During the summer, to more than 300 whales. Other migrating species take advantage After several months spent at high sea, this little clown bird to set foot on solid ground. These colonies settled on Machias Seal Island They've come to enjoy the plentiful food, For both ventures, It allows them to transport up to 30 fish Males with the most colorful beaks During courtship, with whom they'll faithfully spend The puffin sets up its den The parents relay fishing to nourish their sole offspring. A neighboring islet serves as a repository They patiently await the next high tide, the most auspicious moment If some of them prefer others float on their backs so they'll only have to glide These seals live in harmony and derive a whopping benefit These fish-filled waters capable of ingurgitating Summer extends peaceably The temperatures The moon announces a new tide cycle and the appearance The great white shark. This superpredator appreciates This place has everything it likes most: murky waters At night, the silhouette At midsummer, Semipalmated plovers They take possession of Fundy for a stopover of just a few weeks. For them, this is a high-stakes phase. They're here to ingurgitate and gather strength to continue At high tide, the plovers take naps It's a life-saving rest who mustn't draw on the energy reserves The slightest gram of weight lost before the big departure At low tide, like a small army, they gather in tight formation These gatherings allow them to optimize Once again, the Bay of Fundy in the survival of a species. Seventy-five percent of semipalmated plovers and are highly dependent Diana Hamilton, a biology professor studies the birds to better understand The current study that we're doing involves primarily looking Will a bird tagged here or will it just stay in this area? How long will it stay? What will it eat? Sandpipers, carry out their lives They breed in the Arctic, northern Canada, They winter in South America. They need fuel These really are fueling stations. The Bay of Fundy here fueling stations Can you all put it in the water? Once we successfully catch them, we remove the birds from the net and place them into boxes. Then we proceed to process them. Depending upon exactly there are several different things like what we're trying to do here now. This is a receiver, before we deploy them or they won't work. This receiver is then logging the tag ID. Here's the transmitter. What we did was we clipped and then glued the transmitter It weighs one-third of a gram. It's extremely light. We also put They're field-readable, take pictures of them, send them to us, at such and such sight One of the things that we do and look at stable isotopes in the blood. These are isotopes when compared allow us to guess what they're eating. Here, guys. It offers a really rich food supply Due to the nature of Fundy Bay and the fact at low tide, many, This allows the birds to feed freely so it's a great feeding area for them. The falcon has chosen to best attack the colonies of plovers. After a brief moment of panic, the flock of birds It immediately forms a compact mass that allows each bird This strategy dilutes risk. For the most part, the falcon will catch He dives, hitting them with full force This game of high-speed bumper cars The peregrine falcon in the world when it dives. Almost an adult, two or three small birds Its feathers are almost perfect. It's lost its down and should soon be ready The tide is at its apex. The summer season attracts of lobsters on the planet to these coasts. The American lobster It can reach one meter in length Solitary and territorial, This den protects its owner He has no intention of surrendering it. The end of summer approaches The last rays of sunlight pierce the thin veil Moose are great devotees They enjoy immersing themselves and feed on the aquatic plants. A veritable delicacy to the Cervidae, this young male He can ingest more than 20 kilos per day. Time is short. He must make the most of it The common loon also takes advantage of the last gifts of summer He's a regular often at the mercy of the tides. Soon, he'll take flight For his part, the moose will penetrate deep The first rain showers On the cliffs of Hopewell Rocks, the falcons have stopped feeding The goal of these parents is simple: motivate him to fly and teach him to hunt. For migrating species, Two million semipalmated plovers Before regaining their winter quarters, these aerial acrobats Their airborne marathon toward Suriname It will take 72 hours. In the absence of these small Fundy's stock of mud shrimp Whales will also take the southern route Under the watchful eyes of his parents, the young falcon The Bay of Fundy for marine mammals and shorebirds. It's one of the principal For the sedentary animals it's time to prepare for the harsh rigors The waters of Lake Bennett The beavers gobble the last water lilies During the autumn months, they'll work non-stop whose bark The Bay of Fundy's powerful ebb equivalent to all In December, the ice and snow Negative temperatures, manage to freeze the seawater. Broken off by the to and fro of the tides, ice rafts will flow with the currents deserted by the seal colonies. Mollusks and crustaceans to flee from this chaos On the beaches where the mud shrimp live, the water crystallizes After taking a beating from the sun, the algae attached to the rocks and the bergies of ice Fucus is damaged by the ice, At low tide, the mud, It's now trapped To endure the biting cold, trees and carnivorous plants The mudflats are engulfed Most of the animals have migrated. On the beavers' frozen lake, In the forest of mist, only squirrels The latter have managed If only they can remember This practice encourages thus benefiting the forest. Due to a lack the moose have discreetly withdrawn Perfectly adapted to harsh climates, they're now clad The moose makes do with tree bark, which is much less nutritional but sufficient The deer also leave for the bad season to settle in the depths They'll find Bark and plant buds for the coming months. In spring, they'll return Every day, the Bay of Fundy These tides are not only one of the most they also further the development They're the daily guarantee of an incomparable fauna.
