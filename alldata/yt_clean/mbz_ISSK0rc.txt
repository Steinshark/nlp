[brooding music continues] But at this stage, the FBN was way more effective when it came to targeting the mob. - Of all the law enforcement it was the only one that seemed to know everything the Mafia was and it was based largely on the fact that it had been compiling data on each and every mafioso, including Carmine Galante, since 1930. [brooding music continues] - [Narrator] And the FBN also The reason, it had a powerful the Draconian 1956 Narcotics Control Act. - The Narcotics Control that anybody dealing in heroin could get mandatory [brooding music continues] - This was unlike any In Italy or France, people who were arrested of narcotics might serve two [brooding music] - [Narrator] From 1959 onwards, the FBN began to target Galante actively.

Eventually, in 1974, Philip Rastelli was appointed as the head of Galante's crime family, but he was under police investigation and about to be sent to prison. [brooding music] So the Bonannos were ripe for takeover, and Galante began to He wouldn't just take over his own family, he wanted to take on the biggest family in New York, the Gambinos.

When I first became a policeman, heroin was the drug of choice. Very few working-class neighborhoods that weren't losing to heroin trafficking and to heroin use. - Well, the addicts, of course, are the end products of it. And you take an addict of one or $200 a day, think of all the stuff he has to rob and all the muggings and robberies, and that had a severe effect on what was going on in the United States. [suspenseful music] - [Narrator] But to and to realize his plan, now Galante had to get free. This seemed fanciful of the heroin craze, his wish was granted. [brooding music] The man with the borderline was paroled in 1974 for good behavior, on condition he didn't [suspenseful music] After 12 years of careful plotting, the timing could not have been better. He was ready to set his plan into motion. [determined music] Galante got stuck in immediately First, he got his own house in order. - Galante didn't miss a beat. - When he came out of jail, - [Narrator] He moved to at the top of the Bonanno family. With Philip Rastelli Galante assumed the role of acting boss. Then, he laid down a marker. He settled any scores with on his business interests - He was homicidal, quite frankly. He had killed a number of people. He was feared. - The other people around him were absolutely petrified of him. [gun firing] - That made him acceptable not simply a predator himself, but a leader of predators. [feelgood music] - [Narrator] Next, he returned - He wasted no time in solidifying the idea that he would of the heroin through these - [Narrator] He went to Miami, Dallas, Los Angeles, even Disneyland, all the time doing deals And Galante once again hoovered at source, from the Sicilians. - He had that pipeline open, and there was such an upsurge of heroin coming into the United States. - [Narrator] The pipeline worked so well because Galante had a novel - When Galante got out, they established a means of bringing in major amounts of heroin. [plane whooshing] - [Narrator] Airliners the 1970s often had a - They were bringing heroin Every flight that left Milan, Italy, every day, a suitcase or two was put on the flight and unaccompanied. [suitcases whirring] - [Narrator] The suitcases - When it landed at JFK, of course, the suitcases were marked. - [Narrator] A Mafia the marked suitcase before and pass it on into the network. It worked beautifully. - You're talking about possibly 40 kilos of heroin coming in every day. [brooding music] - [Narrator] Bringing in but Galante needed a distribution network. So he hit upon the idea of It just so happened this gave him a chance to strike back at his [static hissing] The Gambino crime family had dominated the cheese and pizza industries for years. They made money by monopolizing to the pizza parlors and [air whooshing] Then, a spate of fires at pizza in Galante's heroin campaign. [static hissing] As the Gambino's restaurants burned, new pizza parlors, owned by Galante, were opened up in their place. And Galante used them to to the dealers. - It would just be distributed. A kilo came in, his people would - They would sell it to who were taking all the heat for this. - [Narrator] In short time, Galante once again built a vast He dominated importation and distribution. Drug agent Frank Panessa - The money that they were making, and not only through the Northeast, he had distribution I dealt with people in Puerto Rico that were getting their [ethereal music] - [Narrator] He had achieved since coming out of jail. It was a ruthlessly fast - One time, an FBI agent the family looked in and he says, &quot;He doesn't look like much. He an old, short guy.&quot; And the other gangster said, &quot;Look out, he's mean. They were afraid of him. &quot;Don't mess with him.&quot; [train clacking] - [Narrator] At this stage, Galante was only dealing in pure heroin, and he had a particularly unpleasant way of testing its purity. He became infamous at this time for what he called &quot;the black man test.&quot; [brooding music continues] An addict would be abducted from Harlem and drugged with two bags of heroin. If he died in a set timeframe, the drug was pure. [brooding music continues] [brooding music] But as time went on, Galante began to want even more. - Galante was his own worst enemy. He was making those millions of dollars, but yet he had the So he would put a whack on it. He would add quinine to it. So something that was 90% heroin, he would whack it so it was 70% heroin and make even more money [upbeat music] - [Narrator] Driven by such greed, his business went from Everything was going well. He was making vast amounts of money and was succeeding in his in all but name. [upbeat music continues] The only thing that might spoil was either the law or who resented his growing dominance. [brooding music] In 1978, it was the law [banging on door] Galante was arrested and the terms of his parole and He had been spotted with other criminals, most notably at a Disneyland It looked like he would just as everything was going so well. But once again, he got away with it. [air whooshing] Enter Galante's attorney, Roy Cohn. Cohn was a controversial figure who had started his career on many high-profile senate committees, like the McCarthy hearings. [brooding music continues] But nowadays, he represented a number of infamous Mafia clients. Cohn had been charged and perjury, and was now seen Nevertheless, he was an undisputed star when it came to getting [tense music] Cohn was Galante's less than secret weapon to ensure he didn't do yet more time. And it worked for him. In 1978, Cohn succeeded in getting the parole violation charge overturned, and Galante became yet for the mob-friendly lawyer. [brooding music] - Thank you, I appreciate the work. - [Narrator] With law Galante could now turn his attention to an even more pressing threat: his jealous fellow mobsters. [brooding music continues] Galante was not stupid, he knew they wanted a but he thought he had a foolproof way to protect himself. [phone clattering] [slow-paced ominous music] He recruited a band of specialist killers, imported directly from and the same town as his family, Castellammare del Golfo. [slow-paced ominous music continues] The derogatory nickname and they had well-defined roles. - The Zips were Sicilians to run the pizza shops that and Pennsylvania, not only but to use these Zips for murders and anything else that [suspenseful music] - [Narrator] For Galante, like American gangsters, but schooled in the old-fashioned and their loyalty was legendary. The other advantage the Zips had was no criminal record in the States. - And they bring 'em over - [Narrator] The Zips appealed to Galante on another level too, they were happy to kill - The Zips would kill anybody American hitmen did not like prosecutors, or judges. They were off-limits to most of the mob. But the Zips would take - [Narrator] With rival most notably supporters and further enemies like the Gambinos, Galante used the Zips to make [suspenseful music] Two of his most trusted known as &quot;The Tall Guy&quot;, and his cousin Baldo Amato. [suspenseful music] - Well, Cesare was a very imposing figure. He was six foot seven. You know, the type that if he he'd constantly be He was a very vain person. Baldo Amato and Cesare Bonventre were responsible for murders. [gun firing] They were used to collect money because they did a lot of shylocking. They controlled card games in Brooklyn, and if somebody didn't pay up they would send out Cesare [brooding music] - [Narrator] To ensure the Zips were rewarded by being In other words, formally initiated and given their own - All of a sudden, they come here and have a beautiful house and have money in the bank and money in cars and stuff. They felt very much indebted to the people that brought them here. [suspenseful music] - [Narrator] With the Zips Galante felt untouchable. - Oh, without a doubt, he He was the one that recruited them, he was the one that made them. They were making major money with him. - [Narrator] As a result, he didn't even bother to carry a gun. [air whooshing] [plane engine whooshing] At the height of his success, not only was Galante worth of heroin a year, he was taking charge And surrounded by loyal guards, he thought he was invulnerable. [upbeat music continues] The fact was, whilst Galante the respect accorded him was often fickle, and Galante failed to His money was making And many still refused as self-proclaimed head of the family. [tense music] Especially, supporters of the imprisoned Bonanno Rastelli hated that Galante and trying to steal his job. [air whooshing] So as the summer heat began dark forces were at work. - One faction of the Bonanno family did not like him heading the family. They made an alliance with a faction of the Gambino family, the underboss, Aniello Dellacroce, who was very, very - [Narrator] This alliance with Dellacroce would prove to be deadly. [tense music] On July 12th, 1979, Galante's driver dropped him off at Joe &amp; Mary's Italian restaurant on Knickerbocker Avenue. [ominous music] It was his cousin's restaurant, and Galante was visiting to wish him well on a forthcoming trip. - Now you have to see the layout. I'll give you the layout. It's a long, narrow restaurant. You came in the front door and in the back of the restaurant, there's a garden cafe - He ate there many times. He had his two trusted bodyguards, who were armed. - [Narrator] With Cesare Bonventre and Baldo Amato watching over him, he felt safe. - He had a friend that he met there.

And then around the in the corner was Leonard Coppola, and his brains were just And I didn't know who these so I took his wallet out and it was him. So I got on the phone, I called the chief of detectives, I called my borough, my boss, everybody, let everybody know. - [Narrator] Local news of Galante splayed out It became an iconic image of - That was the famous picture that went out across the world. - [Narrator] It was such a perfect hit that it entered Mafia folklore. [soft mysterious music] As investigators dug deeper, they soon realized it was a - It was well-planned for them outside the restaurant, and they got away with it. - [Narrator] The getaway car was recovered a few blocks away. [static hissing] And there was an even greater puzzle, where were the Zip bodyguards? Witnesses spoke of two other men in leather jackets fitting the description of Cesare Bonventre and Baldo Amato, hurrying away from the crime scene. It looked like the Zip bodyguards, supposed to protect [brooding music] [police siren blipping] For the New York police and the FBI, it became one of their They needed to solve it to on organized crime.

One of the group, Anthony Bruno Indelicato was charged as one of No one else stood trial. This included the two Zips - They turned themselves a couple of days later, and they had their attorney with them, and they refused anything I asked them. - [Narrator] The motive for Galante had become rich through drugs and refused to share his wealth. This had made enemies both inside and outside his own family. - It was just too much and, you know, we're and millions of dollars. - [Narrator] His determination as Bonanno family boss of those who wanted to kill him. - It's one of those situations where you make a lot of enemies and your enemies get together [light music] - [Narrator] There's a clue as to why the Zips turned on him.
