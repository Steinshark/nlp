&gt;&gt; Pepin: BEET, STILTON, APPLE, NUT, MUSHROOM, SALAD-- ALL THE STUFF THAT I CAN GET IN MY SUPERMARKET. YOU JUST GRAB IT, PUT IT TOGETHER, A GOOD DASH OF PEPPER, SALT IN IT. YOU MIX IT THOROUGHLY, YOU KNOW, WITH A LITTLE BIT OF MAYONNAISE, AND HERE YOU HAVE AN ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL DIFFERENT, UNUSUAL SALAD. ADDING ONE NEW FLAVOR TO A TRADITIONAL COMBINATION CAN CREATE A WHOLE NEW DISH. I'M JACQUES PEPIN, AND THIS IS FAST FOOD MY WAY. [playful instrumental music] HAPPY COOKING. &gt;&gt; female announcer: PRODUCTION FUNDING FOR THIS SERIES HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO YOU BY: &gt;&gt; male announcer: CUISINART, WITH THE NEXT GENERATION OF FOOD PROCESSORS FROM BREAD DOUGH TO PIZZA TO STIR-FRIES. WE DO THE WORK TO SAVE YOU TIME. CUISINART: THE NEXT GENERATION. &gt;&gt; female announcer: AND BY SCHARFFEN BERGER, MAKERS OF FINE ARTISAN DARK CHOCOLATES. RECIPES AVAILABLE AT: AND BY SPECTRUM ORGANICS, A PURVEYOR OF FINE CULINARY OILS AND CONDIMENTS. SPECTRUM: THE TASTE OF GOODNESS. AND BY OXO GOOD GRIPS, MAKERS OF KITCHEN TOOLS THAT MAKE EVERYDAY LIVING EASIER. &gt;&gt; Pepin: I LOVE TO USE THOSE READY-MADE BREAD THAT YOU FIND AT THE SUPERMARKET, YOU KNOW, LAVASH LIKE THIS ONE, AS WELL AS NAAN BREAD, EVEN THE TORTILLA. USUALLY, I BRUSH IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF OIL AND PUT IT IN THE OVEN A FEW MINUTES TO REFIRM IT, AND THAT'S HOW I USE IT. AND TODAY, I'M USING THAT TO MAKE A SALMON PIZZA, WHICH IS REALLY CRUNCHY AND ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL. THEN NEXT, A ROASTED SPLIT CHICKEN WITH A MUSTARD CRUST, AND I DO IT IN A CERTAIN WAY SO THAT IT COOKS VERY FAST. FRESHLY MASHED POTATO WITH IT, IT'S CLASSIC. AND WE FINISH WITH A VERY LIGHT, A GREEK YOGURT NECTAR WITH A MIXTURE OF HONEY AND NUTS IN IT. SIMPLE BUT REALLY GOOD. SO I HAVE A CHICKEN HERE, ABOUT 4 POUND, 3 1/2, 4 POUND. AND WITH THIS, I'M GOING TO DO A MIXTURE, SO THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD START BY DOING. THE CRUST THAT I'M DOING ON IT-- AND IT'S A MUSTARD CRUST, I CALL IT, BECAUSE I PUT A GOOD COUPLE OF TABLESPOON OF A FRENCH-STYLE MUSTARD IN THERE. A LITTLE BIT OF TABASCO, I MEAN, A LITTLE BIT LIKE A TEASPOON, AND MAYBE A TABLESPOON OF SOY SAUCE IN IT. A COUPLE OF TABLESPOON OF WINE, A WHITE WINE, A COUPLE OF TABLESPOON OF OLIVE OIL. ALWAYS USE OLIVE OIL. AND HERBS DE PROVENCE-- I USE THE HERBS DE PROVENCE HERE WITH THE TINY LAVENDER FLOWERS, YOU KNOW, WHICH ARE REALLY GOOD. LIKE, I HAVE HAVE A TABLESPOON OF THAT, WHICH IS QUITE A LOT, ON TOP OF IT. VERY SAVORY, THERE IS THYME IN IT. AND WITH THAT, GARLIC, SO WE PUT A LOT OF GARLIC, MAYBE FOUR OR FIVE. I HIT THAT ON THE SIDE TO SEPARATE YOUR CLOVE OF GARLIC, AND I'M GOING TO PUT 3-- 3, 4-- NO, A GOOD 2 TABLESPOON, 3 TABLESPOON OF GARLIC. SO, HERE FIRST, YOU WANT TO PEEL YOUR GARLIC. AND THE BEST WAY IS JUST TO CUT THE END OF IT. BECAUSE YOU CUT--IF YOU CUT THE END OF IT, THIS IS WHERE, ACTUALLY, THE STEM HERE IS ATTACHED, SO YOU CUT THIS, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO REMOVE THAT PART OF THE GARLIC BEFORE YOU PEEL IT AND AFTER-- OR AFTER YOU PEEL IT. AND THE ADVANTAGE OF DOING IT THIS WAY--IF YOU DO IT BEFORE YOU PEEL IT--WHEN YOU CRUSH YOUR GARLIC A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS, THAT WILL RELEASE THE SKIN. SEE, THE SKIN WILL COME OUT VERY EASILY, WHICH IS NOT GOING TO COME OUT UNLESS YOU TAKE THE END OF IT HERE. SO YOU CRUSH IT A LITTLE BIT, AS I SAY. AND AGAIN, YOU SEE THE-- THE SKIN WILL COME OUT QUITE EASILY. NOW, YOU CHECK YOUR GARLIC AFTER SOME TIME, YOU KNOW. YOU HAVE BLACK SPOTS, SO YOU HAVE TO REMOVE IT. OKAY, THAT SHOULD BE MORE THAN ENOUGH. YEAH, THAT'S A LOT OF GARLIC. OKAY, SO NOW I'M GOING TO CRUSH THAT GARLIC. AND YOU SEE, YOU ALWAYS WORK ON THAT HAND OF THE TABLE, BECAUSE WHEN YOU USE THAT KNIFE, YOU HAVE SPACE HERE, BUT WHEN YOU USE IT HORIZONTALLY, THEN YOU HAVE TO CLEAR UP THE TABLE. THAT RELEASES THE ESSENTIAL OIL, YOU KNOW, RELEASING THE GARLIC THIS WAY. I THINK THAT'S QUITE A LOT HERE, SO... SO, FINELY CHOP GARLIC. MAYBE A LITTLE MORE. THAT'S IT. SO I THINK I HAVE A GOOD 2, 2-3 TABLESPOONS OF GARLIC, SO THAT'S A PRETTY ASSERTIVE--A PRETTY ASSERTIVE TYPE OF A CRUST THAT I'M PUTTING ON TOP HERE. SO HERE IT IS. NOW THE CHICKEN. AS I SAID, THIS IS A ROASTER. SOME CALL IT A ROASTER, DEPENDING ON THE SIZE, BUT THIS IS AT LEAST 4 POUND. I WANT TO REMOVE THE CENTRAL PART OF THE--THE BACK HERE, AND THOSE SHEARS ARE GREAT TO DO IT THIS WAY. THOSE SHEAR ARE TERRIFIC, ALSO, TO CARVE THE CHICKEN AFTER, YOU KNOW, AFTER YOU FINISH COOKING IT. ACTUALLY, I COULD OPEN IT THIS WAY. EVEN IF I LEAVE THAT PIECE OF--OF BACK, IT'S OKAY, BUT I TEND TO REMOVE IT SO IT STAY FLATTER. OF COURSE, I DON'T THROW THAT OUT. I USE THAT IN CHICKEN STOCK. SO HERE, BREAK IT A LITTLE BIT IN THE MIDDLE HERE SO YOU CAN BREAK IT THIS WAY. I'M GOING TO CUT THE END OF THE STEM SO THAT BY THE TIME THE CHICKEN FINISH COOKING, THE--THE BONE SHOULD STICK OUT LIKE THIS A LITTLE BIT. AND I'LL BRING THAT IN THE BACK. AND MAYBE THE SECRET OF THAT COOKING IS THAT THE PART WHERE IT'S VERY HARD SOMETIMES, THAT IT DOESN'T COOK, IS RIGHT THERE, YOU KNOW. THIS IS BETWEEN THE STEM, BETWEEN THE--THE DRUMSTICK AND THE THIGH. SO I CUT THAT OPEN A LITTLE BIT. AND THAT WILL--I MEAN, THAT CHICKEN WILL GO INTO THE OVEN. A CHICKEN WILL TAKE A GOOD HOUR. THAT CHICKEN WILL BE COOKED IN 30, 35 MINUTES, BECAUSE I AM INSERTING IT, YOU KNOW. I CUT IT UP IN BETWEEN THE JOINT HERE AND THE SAME THING, AGAIN, THE LITTLE BIT OF THE JOINT OF THE SHOULDER HERE, YOU KNOW, THAT JOINT RIGHT THERE. IT'S BASICALLY THE SPOT THAT ALWAYS GETS A BIT RED, YOU KNOW, NEVER GET COOKED COMPLETELY, SO YOU DO THIS. FOLD--WITH A FOLD, ACTUALLY, I PUT--I COULD PUT IT DIRECTLY IN THERE. AND I'M GOING TO PLACE MY CHICKEN ON THIS HERE WITH MY MUSTARD. SO I'M GOING TO PUT THAT INSIDE. I PUT IT ALL OVER THE PLACE, THE CRUST. AND I WANT TO START COOKING IT IN A LARGE--IN A LARGE NONSTICK PAN LIKE THIS. SO YOU KNOW WHAT I DID HERE. SO I'LL PUT THIS ON THIS SIDE HERE. ALREADY COOKING, BECAUSE MY POT IS REALLY HOT. THE REST OF IT IS GOING TO GO RIGHT ON TOP OF IT. MMM. I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF IT HERE. SO FIRST, THE CHICKEN BEING SPLIT UP AND COOK FASTER. AND SECONDLY, AS I SAY, I CUT BETWEEN THE ARTICULATIONS TO INCREASE, YOU KNOW, TO MAKE THE COOKING FASTER. ALL OF THAT HAS TO BE CLEANED. THIS IS GOING TO COOK FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTE ON THE STOVE. AND THEN AFTER, I PUT IT INTO THE OVEN AT 425 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT TEMPERATURE FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES. SO I NEED ABOUT 2, 3 CUPS OF WATER TO DO THE MASHED POTATOES. SO I'LL DO IT HERE. I WILL DO THAT, BECAUSE I NEED TO WASH MY HANDS AFTER THE CHICKEN. OKAY, AND I NEED ABOUT 3 CUPS OF WATER. THAT'S ABOUT IT. OKAY, TO START THE MASHED POTATO THAT MY AUNT USED TO DO-- WE CALLED LA MARRAINE. LA MARRAINE, WHICH WAS MY GODMOTHER, IF YOU WANT. LA MARRAINE USED TO DO HER MASHED POTATOES THIS WAY. SO WHAT I DO THERE, AFTER I PEEL THE POTATO, OF COURSE-- AND I USE YUKON GOLD HERE. I LOVE THE YUKON GOLD POTATO. GOOD DASH OF SALT. AND HER SECRET WAS TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF GARLIC IN IT. NOW, THE GARLIC THAT SHE WOULD DO, SHE COULD GET--GET A WHOLE CLOVE OF GARLIC LIKE THIS AND PUT THEM--SHE WOULD PUT THEM DIRECTLY LIKE THIS WITHOUT TAKING THE SHELL OFF. AND THE REASON WAS THAT BECAUSE SHE WOULD ALWAYS PUTTING THAT THROUGH THE FOOD MILL. I'M GOING TO PUT IT THROUGH THE FOOD MILL TODAY. IN CASE I DON'T, THEN OTHERWISE, WE'LL PEEL THE GARLIC I HAVE. BECAUSE, SEE, THE FACT OF PUTTING IT THROUGH THE FOOD MILL, OF COURSE, ELIMINATES THE SKIN. BUT IF YOU DON'T, YOU BETTER TAKE THE SKIN BEFORE. SO HERE I AM HERE. BRING IT TO A BOIL. THIS WILL BE INCORPORATED IN THE MASHING OF THE POTATO, AND IT GETS VERY MILD. THIS HAS TO COME TO A BOIL. AND THE CHICKEN IS ABOUT READY TO GO INTO THE OVEN NOW. AND THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO DO-- A 425-DEGREE OVEN, REMEMBER, HIGH OVEN FOR A GOOD 30 MINUTE. OKAY. AND NOW LET'S DO THE FIRST COURSE, WHICH IS OUR PIZZA. SO IN THE PIZZA, I'M GOING TO PUT SOME RED ONION, A BEAUTIFUL RED ONION HERE THAT I'LL SLICE THIN. THAT'S IT. AND SEPARATE IT LIKE THIS, OKAY. AND I'M GOING TO PUT SOUR CREAM, A GOOD 1/2 CUP OF SOUR CREAM I NEED FOR THAT TO 3/4 OF A CUP, AND A COUPLE OF TABLESPOON OF HORSERADISH, CRACKED PEPPER, OR FRESHLY GROUND PEPPER, EH? THAT MACHINE IS GOOD, BECAUSE I CAN TURN THIS HERE TO GET IT COARSER OR FINER. OKAY. THAT'S IT. SO YOU DO THAT, WELL, MAYBE TEN MINUTES BEFORE YOU SERVE IT, BUT NOT TOO, TOO LONG AHEAD. YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO-- TO SOFTEN TOO MUCH THE-- YOU KNOW, YOUR--YOUR PIZZA OR YOUR DOUGH HERE, WHICHEVER DOUGH YOU'RE GOING TO USE. SO FOR ME HERE, I'M GOING TO USE THAT-- IT'S NICE AND DRY NOW-- ON THIS AND PUT SOME OF MY MIXTURE RIGHT ON TOP OF IT HERE. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN FIND IN ANY MARKET--YOU FIND GREAT SMOKED SALMON NOW. YOU PAY MORE MONEY DEPENDING WHETHER IT COME FROM IRELAND OR WHETHER IT'S A LOX OR WHETHER IT COMES FROM SCOTLAND AS WELL. BUT ANY--ANY TYPE OF SALMON IS GOING TO BE NICE HERE. MMM, IT'S GOOD. OKAY, ONION ON TOP AND-- AND THEN THE SMOKED SALMON. I NEED A LITTLE BIT OF ONION TO PUT ON TOP, WHICH I LEAVE HERE. AND MY SMOKED SALMON COME DIRECTLY IN PACKAGE LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW. AND IT'S ALL PRESLICED, WHICH MAKES IT VERY EASY TO USE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS ONE COME FROM. OKAY, NICE SLICE OF SALMON. YOU WANT TO ARRANGE IT MAYBE NOT TOO FLAT ON TOP OF IT. YOU CAN WRINKLE IT A LITTLE BIT, BECAUSE LIKE THAT, YOU CAN PUT MORE SALMON. WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT IF YOU BRING IT, IF YOU TWIST IT A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS, YOU HAVE A BIT OF A THICKER LAYER OF SALMON. I MEAN, FOR FOUR PEOPLE YOU WOULD WANT TO HAVE ABOUT 6, 8 OUNCES--6 TO 8 OUNCES OF SALMON HERE. YOU CAN SEE I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF THE CREAM SHOWING, YOU KNOW. IT'S NICE. THERE WE ARE, ANOTHER PIECE AND ANOTHER TWO PIECE HERE. THAT SHOULD BE ABOUT-- YEAH, THAT SHOULD BE ABOUT ENOUGH THIS WAY. A LITTLE MORE RED ONION ON TOP. I'M GOING TO ADD SOME CAPERS ON IT AND ABOUT, WELL, A GOOD TABLESPOON OR SO OF CAPERS. MMM, HERE WE ARE. NOW, I COULD PUT SOME BASIL ON TOP. I TEND TO LIKE TO PUT A BIT OF CILANTRO ON TOP HERE. SO I PUT THE CILANTRO KIND OF COARSE LIKE THIS. THAT'S A GREAT--GIVE IT ANOTHER TASTE, YOU KNOW. SOME PEOPLE LOVE CILANTRO. SOME HATE IT. IF YOU DON'T LIKE CILANTRO, PUT PARSLEY OR PUT BASIL. BASIL WOULD BE PERFECTLY FINE ON TOP OF IT HERE. AND THEN I CAN CUT IT. YOU WANT--YOU CAN HEAR HOW CRUNCHY IT IS. THIS ONE AT LEAST IN THREE PIECE. I WANT TO MOVE THIS ONE A LITTLE HERE SO IT HIDE UP THE MESS THAT I DID ON THE SIDE. HERE WE ARE. AND THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. AND WHAT BETTER WITH THIS-- WHEN YOU START A NICE AND ELEGANT DINNER LIKE THIS, PEOPLE WILL NEVER KNOW THAT IT ONLY TOOK YOU THREE MINUTES TO DO--A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE. NOTICE THAT I HAVE A PIECE OF WET PAPER TOWEL HERE. I ALWAYS PUT THAT ON THE COUNTER WHEN I CUT SO THAT THE BOARD DOESN'T SLIDE ALL OVER THE PLACE, WHICH IS OFTEN THE REASON WHY PEOPLE CUT THEMSELVES. THEY CUT AND THE--THE BOARD SLIDE ALL OVER THE PLACE. SO HERE WE WANT TO HAVE A-A LITTLE GLASS OF--OF BUBBLY HERE. SO YOU WANT TO REMOVE THIS UP TO THAT POINT. ALWAYS KEEP YOUR THUMB ON TOP OF IT SO THAT YOU DON'T GET THE EYE OUT OF SOMEONE ELSE. AND AT THAT POINT HERE, WHEN YOU GRAB YOUR CORK-- YOU GRAB THE CORK AND YOU MOVE THE BOTTLE. YOU DON'T MOVE THE CORK. SEE, I MOVED THE BOTTLE WITH THAT HAND AND VERY SLOWLY. SO WE JUST POP A LITTLE BIT. IN GREAT RESTAURANT, IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO POP MORE THAN THAT. I LIKE TO MAKE IT DO A LOT OF NOISE, BUT... AND OFTEN, IN YOUR GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE, YOU SEE WHEN THE GLASS HASN'T BEEN USED, IT FOAM A LOT. SO YOU POUR ONCE, LET IT GO DOWN, AND POUR A SECOND TIME AND A THIRD TIME AND A FOURTH TIME. WELL, SALMON PIZZA. THAT'S GOOD. SO NEXT IS OUR DESSERT, A VERY SIMPLE, ELEGANT DESSERT. I'VE BEEN TO GREECE MANY, MANY TIME, AND THERE IS NO YOGURT LIKE THE GREEK YOGURT THAT YOU GET IN GREECE. BUT NOW WE CAN BUY GREEK YOGURT. IT'S STILL NOT QUITE AS GOOD. SO TO MAKE IT A BIT RICHER, I PUT A LITTLE BIT OF SOUR CREAM HERE. THIS IS 2 CUP OF--OF YOGURT. AND I PUT ABOUT A CUP, 1/2 CUP, AT THE MOST, OF SOUR CREAM TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE LIKE THE GREEK YOGURT IN GREECE. OKAY. STIRRING THAT TOGETHER. IT'S CLASSIC AND GREAT TO BE SERVED WITH HONEY, YOU KNOW. ANOTHER CLASSIC INGREDIENT OF GREECE IS LEMON. ANOTHER CLASSIC ONE IS NUTS. ANOTHER CLASSIC ONE IS MINT. SO I PUT ALL OF THOSE INGREDIENTS TOGETHER. HERE WE ARE. SO LOOK AT THAT YOGURT-- BEAUTIFUL. ABOUT THAT MUCH AT THE MOST. THAT'S A HEFTY PORTION. OKAY, I LOVE TO USE THAT LITTLE GADGET HERE, THAT REALLY NICE HONEY HERE. SOMETIME YOU LIKE YOUR HONEY WHEN IT'S SLIGHTLY GRAINY, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU HAVE SOME OF THE--THE COMB IN IT. I WANT TO PUT-- I HAVE WALNUTS HERE. SOME OF THEM ARE TOASTED. SOME ARE NOT TOASTED. I THINK I WOULD RATHER HAVE THE ONE NOT TOASTED. THREE OR FOUR, THAT'D BE FINE. MAYBE A LITTLE PIECE OF-- OF ZEST OF LEMON, YOU KNOW, A COUPLE LIKE THIS GOES WELL WITH IT. AND ACTUALLY, THE MINT HERE, WE CAN SERVE IT WHOLE, BUT I LIKE TO DO A CHIFFONADE, WHAT WE CALL A CHIFFONADE OF MINT. AND THEN YOU GATHER THE LEAF TOGETHER, AND YOU CUT IT INTO A WRINKLED MIXTURE LIKE THAT TO RESEMBLE CHIFFON, YOU KNOW, THE MATERIAL CALLED CHIFFON. YOU PUT IT A BIT ALL OVER. AND HERE IT IS: OUR GREEK YOGURT NECTAR. OOP. MY CHICKEN LOOK BEAUTIFUL NOW, NICE AND BROWN, MAYBE EVEN A BIT TOO BROWN. IT COOKED QUITE FAST. AND--AND WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO WITH THIS IS ACTUALLY TO DEGLAZE IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CHICKEN STOCK TO EXTEND THE NATURAL JUICE UNDERNEATH. IN ANY CASE, WITH THIS, A GOOD CHICKEN LIKE THAT, I WANT A GOOD RED WINE. AND A GOOD RED WINE--I HAVE HERE A WINE FROM THE SOUTH OF FRANCE, LIKE A GIGONDAS TYPE OF WINE, WHICH ARE SYRAH, GRENACHE, AND SO FORTH. AND THAT'S VERY GOOD. I THINK THE CHICKEN IS GOING TO THANK ME FOR GIVING HIM A LITTLE BIT OF THAT, TOO, JUST A LITTLE BIT. AND A BIT OF-- A BIT OF CHICKEN STOCK. AND BOIL THAT A COUPLE OF MINUTES, JUST TO-- TO EXTEND THE SAUCE. IT SMELLS WONDERFUL. AND THEN THE MASHED POTATO HAVE BEEN COOKED HERE. SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS REALLY TO DRAIN THEM OUT. I NEED THIS. TAKE THE WATER OUT. OKAY, AND IN THE MASHED POTATO NOW, REMEMBER, I HAVE THE GARLIC IN IT. I WANT TO PUT A TABLESPOON OF BUTTER, SOME MILK. AND THERE IS DIFFERENT WAY OF MAKING YOUR MASHED POTATO. I THINK THIS IS FINE HERE, COOKED PLENTY. BUT YOU CAN USE A RICER LIKE THIS, WHICH IS PERFECTLY FINE IF YOU WOULD HAVE TO TAKE YOUR POTATO. PUT THEM RIGHT THROUGH IT. WE USE THAT FOR PUREE OF CHESTNUT AS WELL, YOU KNOW. IT'S REALLY GOOD, ESPECIALLY THE PUREE OF CHESTNUT, BECAUSE IT DOES LONG STRING. AND YOU WANT TO KEEP SOMETIME THOSE STRING LIKE THIS WHEN YOU DO CERTAIN TYPE OF DESSERT SO THAT WHEN WE'RE DOING IT, YOU CAN ALSO PUT IT DIRECTLY INTO A--A FOOD MILL, WHICH I USE OFTEN. AND THIRDLY, IF YOU DON'T MIND THE POTATO BEING A BIT COARSE, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN USE JUST YOUR REGULAR MASHER LIKE THIS, WHICH IS MORE HOMEMADE TYPE OF THING, WHICH IS FINE. ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT YOUR POTATO IN THE FOOD PROCESSOR. THAT'D BE THE WORST THING TO DO. WE CALL THAT CORDING. IT'S FROM THE--THE CORD, YOU KNOW, STRINGY AND PASTY-LIKE. SO A BIT OF MILK. I WANT TO MIX THAT WITH THIS. YEAH, THEY ARE FLUFFY ENOUGH TO ME. AND IN ADDITION, VERY OFTEN I FINISH THEM WITH A WHISK TO MAKE THEM NICE AND FLUFFY. AND HERE IS MY SHEAR AGAIN THAT I USED TO CUT IT RAW. I WASHED IT, OF COURSE, BUT A GREAT WAY OF USING IT TO CUT THE CHICKEN, GO THIS WAY. CUT IT IN HALF. I CAN HOLD IT A LITTLE BIT WITH THIS SO IT DOESN'T RUN AWAY FROM ME. OKAY, IN HALF, THE LEG. THE BREAST--LIKE THAT, I CAN CUT THE BREAST EVEN, IN TWO PIECES. I LIKE TO USUALLY SERVE PIECES OF THE BREAST AS WELL AS THE PIECES OF THE LEG, YOU KNOW. IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR FOUR PEOPLE. IT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH, A BIG CHICKEN LIKE THIS. AND THEN REMEMBER THAT WONDERFUL JUICE THAT I HAVE UNDERNEATH. THE LEG IS CUT IN HALF AS WELL. MY WIFE LOVED THOSE BECAUSE I DON'T MESS UP THE TABLE. THIS IS THE IDEA. OKAY, AND NOW WE CAN SERVE THAT REAL CLASSIC DISH, YOU KNOW. VERY HOT. MY MASHED POTATO HERE. WELL... UM, MAYBE A PIECE OF THE BREAST HERE, AND MAYBE THE-- THE DRUMSTICK RIGHT THERE. I ALREADY MESSED UP MY PLATE. A BIT OF JUICE, AND YOU HAVE ALL THAT NATURAL JUICE NOW. YOU WANT TO POUR THAT ON YOUR CHICKEN. AND HERE, ESPECIALLY FOR THE KID, YOU KNOW, YOU GO WITH A GOOD TABLESPOON OF THAT, MAKE A HOLE IN YOUR MASHED POTATO, YOU KNOW, TO POUR IT ALL AROUND. AND THIS WITH A GLASS OF RED WINE IS LIKE HEAVEN: MASHED POTATO AND ROAST SPLIT CHICKEN. SOMETIME YOU HAVE THE FAMILIAR-- THE EARTHY FLAVOR THAT FULLY SATISFY YOU. AND IT DOES SATISFY ME.
