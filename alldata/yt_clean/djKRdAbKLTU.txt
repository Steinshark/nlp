This older woman lives all alone, but she feels happy here. Her house is actually a museum. There are a lot of authentic handmade things here. Embroidered towels and paintings, old photographs, various wooden decorations - all of this is pleasing to the eye. The scenery around here is fantastic, but the wind is so strong that sometimes it blows the doors off. Kateryna is a real treasure for folklorists because she knows unique Hutsul songs. Moreover, she has been composing and singing them herself for many years. Kateryna has a large yard and a well-equipped house, but she doesn't need so much herself. That's why she lives in a small hut nearby. She feels comfortable here. She used to do a lot of embroidery. It's a very painstaking job, but such items are priceless. Even now, despite her poor eyesight, she cross-stitches huge towels. In fact, it is very difficult to create such an ornament. Not everyone can do it. Hutsul embroidery is unique because the smallest ornament has its own meaning. Even the colors of the embroidery are chosen for a reason. They also have a certain meaning. Kateryna's neighbor's mare Zorka often comes to visit her. She loves to graze here. The woman lives in absolute harmony and harmony with herself and others. Mrs. Kateryna shows off her treasures - embroidered jewelry. She has been creating all this all her life. She lived it with her husband, who, unfortunately, has already passed away. The woman tells how she met her future husband, how she lived with him for more than 60 years. Everything around her reminds her of the greatest love of her life - personal belongings, photographs. Of course, Kateryna has children and grandchildren, but she lives alone. They visit her and help her with the housework. She does not need much. But the woman is very happy when guests come to her. That's why she cooks dinner for everyone today. Mrs. Kateryna is washing potatoes and will make delicious mashed potatoes. She has a compact kitchen with everything she needs - dishes, appliances, pots and pans. The woman even has a gas stove on which she can quickly boil potatoes. And while dinner is cooking, you can chat with your new neighbors. Everyone in the village knows each other and supports each other. Up in the mountains, everyone lives in harmony with nature, enjoying the mesmerizing sounds. The potatoes are already boiling, so they need to make flavorful and crispy bacon to go with them. The woman cuts fresh lard into small pieces and fries them well. She also adds onions, which Kateryna cuts into cubes. Everything is cooked, steaming, and smells delicious. The woman cooks very well. And while she's salted the potatoes and stirring the cracklings, she tells us about her past. The food she cooks is very simple, accessible, but this is exactly what makes it special. Because it is delicious and familiar to everyone since childhood. Everything in this lady's house can be safely exhibited in a museum. These are very valuable things. It is a real Ukrainian cultural heritage. In addition to mashed potatoes, the woman offers pirogi for lunch. That's what they call dumplings here. She cooked them yesterday, and today she just heats them up in a frying pan. By the way, these fried dumplings are very tasty because they have a crispy crust. The woman has furniture in her house that was made by her father. There are many things that immediately catch your eye. Despite the fact that things are old, they are very valuable because they have a history. The handmade furniture and decorations are unique because they are inimitable. The mashed potatoes are almost ready. Kateryna pours the bacon into the potatoes and mixes everything thoroughly. Now it's time to set the table. The aroma in the house is so good that you can swallow your tongue. Such a meal gives you a lot of strength, which is very important if you live in the countryside. You still have a whole day ahead of you, and many important things to do. Hutsul budz cheese and strong tincture are always served for lunch. And in the afternoon, you have to give yourself time to rest. Kateryna loves to sing and does it quite often. Local songs tell the centuries-old history of our people. It was through these tunes that important knowledge was passed down from generation to generation. The water here is spring water, but it is not connected to the house, so it has to be collected in different containers. People here care about nature and feel grateful to it. Because it is nature that creates the beauty around us that humans are unable to create. Of course, there are a lot of songs about Oleksa Dovbush here in the mountains. He has been sung here for many centuries. Listening to these songs, you can understand how original and interesting the Hutsul dialect is. By the way, traditional melodies of local songs are also passed down from generation to generation. Kateryna sings all the time, both when she is resting and when she is working. With a song, time passes faster, and any task becomes more fun. And now we can get back to embroidery. Kateryna creates handmade inserts for embroidered shirts. These items are actually very expensive, and they are valued all over the world. It takes a lot of time and effort to create them. But a handmade shirt is always unique, because you won't find another one like it anywhere else. After lunch, the dishes have to be washed, so Kateryna takes her time. But now all the plates are clean, all that's left is for them to dry. Mrs. Kateryna also has work outside. She needs to rake up the fallen leaves. For this, she uses a special wide rake. She also has to pick apples that are already on the ground. You can't leave them like that so they don't rot. The territory here is very large, so the woman has to move around a lot every day. And Zirka came to visit Mrs. Kateryna again. The atmosphere here is very good. Only the fence does not allow the filly to go further than allowed. Meanwhile, Mrs. Kateryna piles fallen leaves and yellowed grass on a sheet to burn later. If left as it is, the wind will instantly blow it around the yard. In villages, garbage is traditionally burned, which is quite convenient, but sometimes dangerous. That's why you need to constantly monitor the fire so that it doesn't spread over a large area. Although, in fact, there is much more smoke from the grass than fire. This work is physically demanding, and Ms. Kateryna does it all by herself. But maybe that's why she is so vigorous at her venerable age. Still, movement is life, and the woman proves it by her example. She easily bends down to pick apples and feels good. This is the harvest she managed to gather in a matter of minutes. "We need to prepare for winter, put everything away so that there is less work in the spring. Soon there will be no yellowed grass left in the yard. And when the fire is already burning down, they can return to the house. Kateryna says that God made her so that she cannot grow old. And there is some truth in this. And we thank you for spending this day with us and Mrs. Kateryna.
