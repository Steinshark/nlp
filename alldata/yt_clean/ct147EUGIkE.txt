Grand opening. Great gifts. Hello, beautiful. Grand opening gifts. What happened? Did I get heatstroke? Congratulations, you're pregnant. Pregnant. Right. You look pale. You need to improve your nutrition. So the baby can be healthy. Baby, you came at the wrong time. Mom can't bring you. You came into the world to suffer. I. You can't keep this child. If you don't want it, you should get the surgery done sooner. The further along, the more dangerous it is. Okay, let's do it today. Please help me arrange the surgery. Surgery. Go wait outside. Sure. That girl, really is pregnant. Our people followed her to the hospital. It's absolutely true. After Ah Yu's accident, the doctors said he lost his ability to have children. Heaven has eyes. The Lu family finally has offspring. How could my granddaughter-in-law and great-grandson be abandoned? Just watch me deal with him. But, but what? That girl seems to not want this child. She's preparing to have an abortion at the hospital. What? Quick, quick, quick! Get the car ready. Let's go to the hospital right away . It's the old lady. I'm sorry, I'm not ready yet to be responsible for your future. Li Tangtang is ready. Come in for the check-up. Okay. Keep the baby. I finally made it. My dear, you cannot have an abortion. You tell Cell A Company that if they think putting something on the contract that requires a magnifying glass to read is a legal risk addendum, that works on the mainland, then the Lu Group won't mind letting Cela's trade relations disappear from the mainland. President, the old lady is looking for you. She wants you to pick up the phone quickly. She has something urgent to discuss with you. Wait a minute. If you can't come up with satisfactory information, then don't bother. Yes. Grandma. What's the matter? You brat . You still know how to answer the phone? Grandma, what's going on? Let me be clear, if you set me up with blind dates again, then there's no need to say more. I will not go. No, no, no. Grandma, from now on I won't push you to go on blind dates anymore. What's going on? Come back right now. With your wife. Go get your marriage certificate. Grandma, stop it. I haven't even dated anyone. Where would I get a wife? I knew you wouldn't believe me. Grandma isn't lying to you. You'll see when you come back. Ah, let's talk later. I still have things to do at work. I' ll hang up now. Lu Chiyu. If you don't come back, I'll hang myself to show you. Assistant. Prepare the car. Yes. Wait. President. What else do you need? About the woman I asked you to check, what's going on with her? I'm incompetent. The hotel surveillance was conveniently down that night. It didn't capture that part. We still haven't found her whereabouts. No matter what method, dig three feet into the ground , you must find her for me. Understood, Mr. Lu. Investigate her identity. Clarify if she's a competitor or a corporate spy sent over. Got it, Mr. Lu. I'll get right on it. Want to run away? Not that easy. Madam. Tang Tang. You're pregnant. Sit down quickly. And also, SMILED T. From now on, call me grandma. Got it? Grandma. I don't even know you. Did you get the wrong person? It's impossible to get it wrong. My grandson will be back soon, you'll find out then. Tang Tang, darling. Can you tell me first, what kind of boy do you like? This grandma must be wanting a great- grandson. I'll pacify her first. Once her grandson returns, the misunderstanding will be cleared up, and I'll hurry back to the hospital. I like gentle ones. Oh no. Ah Yu, that little brat, is not gentle at all. Cold as an icebox. And also, it's best if he's around the same age. So we have something to talk about. Tang Tang. How old are you? I'm twenty this year, Grandma. A-Yu is already twenty -nine. He'll be thirty in a few months. Tang Tang will definitely dislike him. Grandma. What's wrong with you? Nothing, nothing. So, do you like... ...a boyfriend who's a few years older than you? Two or three years older is okay. But... ...he has to be handsome. Oh no, oh no. A-Yu is old and ugly. And has a bad personality. He doesn't meet any of Tang Tang's requirements. Young Master is back . This good-for-nothing. What's the use of coming back now? Tang Tang, sweetie. Wait for me here. I'll go... ...bring that useless grandson of mine to see you. Although he's not much to look at... ...he still has a little money. These people are talking so strangely. Could this be a scam? Grandma. Why are you so late? Come with me. Go meet your wife. Grandma, can you stop messing around? I won't marry a stranger. Who's messing around? You're taking Tang Tang to get a marriage license today. And the wedding will be arranged soon. Impossible. I won't just marry... ...a woman I don't know. You brat! She's pregnant with your child! How dare you not take responsibility? My child? Grandma... ...you know... ...it's impossible for me to get a woman pregnant. How can you still be... ...fooled by such a clumsy trick? Whoever wants to marry her can marry her. I' m not marrying her anyway. Fine. You're not marrying her, right? Xiao Su. Yes. I'll ask you one more time. Will you marry her or not? No. Alright, alright. I see you don't ... ...care about your grandma's life at all. Oh, Madam! Oh! Grandma! Are you serious? This little... ...abandoned his wife and child! I must go down and apologize to our ancestors! Don't! Don't! Young Master You should at least go take a look. Okay. I'll go take a look. What's her name... Tang Tang. What kind of potion did she give you? Let's go. Grandma. She's just a fraud. You little brat. Don't talk nonsense. Tang Tang is a good girl. Look. You little brat. It's all your fault that my granddaughter-in-law got upset and left. Ouch, ouch, ouch. You need to go find my granddaughter-in-law right now. If you can't find her, don't come back. Then you take care of yourself. Assistant He. President. Help me pack my personal belongings. Move them to the company to stay. Okay , okay, okay. Little Su. Where's my rope? Hang it up for me. Alright. Grandma. What are you doing again? I'm going down. To tell our ancestors. Dreaming every day, teaching you a lesson, you heartless little brat. You little brat. Alright, alright, alright. I'll help you go find her, okay? That's more like it. Here. This is Tang Tang's photo. Let me say this first: I can help you find her, but I absolutely will not marry her. It's her. Grandma. You're saying the one who's pregnant with my child is her. Of course. Good granddaughter-in-law. Give me a good great-grandson. Then, I won' t bother with you little brat. Assistant He. Yes. Go find her immediately. Make sure to find this woman. We've been looking for her for so long, and suddenly she appears. Could it be that she really is pregnant? Baby . If Mommy leaves you behind but can't provide you with a good life, will you blame me? You little girl. Where have you been for this whole month? The whole family has been looking for you, did you know? I' m sorry. I worried you all. It's all because of you. Our Li family is about to starve. You better come back right now. Apologize to Mr. Liu. He was getting handsy with me. Why should I apologize to him? Mr. Liu taking a liking to you is a blessing for you. Come back right now. Otherwise, you'll regret it. Ting. Why is she treating me like this? Can a mother really not love her own child? No matter how tough life gets from now on, I will work hard to earn money and raise my baby well. Hello. Are you still hiring part-timers? On a day that's over thirty degrees, you still have to wear a mascot costume. A girl can't handle this kind of hardship. Look at others. I can do it. Okay, okay. I'm on my way now. I can start today. Great. Tang Tang. Where exactly are you ? How's everything going now? Mom misses you so much. Tang Tang. Mom really misses you. If heaven allows, I would give everything to ensure your safety and happiness. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. Ma'am , are you alright? This familiar feeling can't be wrong. She must be my daughter. Tang Tang. Mom's here. Tang Tang. Where's my daughter? Where have you gone, Tang Tang? I clearly saw you! It's you. It's you, isn't it? Tang Tang. Ah Xiao. Come here quickly. Mom saw Tang Tang. Mom. Mom, are you okay? Hurry and find Tang Tang. Mom, is your old problem acting up again? Let's go to the hospital. Mom, don't worry. Listen to me. If she is in this city, we will definitely find her. Let's go to the hospital first, okay? Hello, Yao Yao. We'll take Mom to the hospital first. You come directly to the hospital later. Let's go, Mom. Hello, Yao Yao. Let's take Mom to the hospital first. You can come to the hospital directly later. Okay. I've already arrived at the cafe. Then I'll go straight to the hospital later. What's wrong with you? You got my new shoes dirty. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just didn't hold it steady. I didn't mean to. I'll wipe them clean for you. Wipe what? Pay me for them. I only splashed a little bit of mineral water. It can't be that serious. A pair of dirty shoes? I won't wear them a second time. Alright. Guess I 'm just unlucky. This time you are lucky. These are my cheapest pair of shoes. Sweep it away. One hundred thousand. It's clearly just a bit of mineral water splashed. I can wipe it clean for you. You insist on me paying . My whole day's salary plus the heat allowance is only two hundred sixty. That's all I have. You might as well call the police on me. Poor people just argue nonsensically. Considering how poor you are, you don't need to pay. Then just give me the shoes. Lick them clean. You. Young master. Our people just got the news. The young lady is handing out flyers by the street. What? Giving up the Lu family's glory and wealth to hand out flyers on the street for money? Is it a ploy? Or have I really misunderstood her? The address has been sent to your phone. The old lady and I are on our way. Give me the phone. You little brat. You come over here right now . Tang Tang is pregnant. If anything happens, I won't let you off the hook. Go to this location. Yes. Slow down, Mom. Isn't that Yao Yao? What's she doing? She seems to be arguing with someone. Let's go. Let's see what's going on. Hey, where are you going? First clean my shoes, then talk. I've already apologized to you. And, I'm even willing to pay for the cleaning. You can't insult people like this . You dare to talk back? Who are you? Are you her? She got my shoes dirty. It's only right for me to seek compensation from her. Why are you bullying? It was just a little splash of water. I could wipe it clean for you. Why should I pay you a hundred thousand? A hundred thousand, right? Alright. I've already bought your shoes. Take off the shoes. Then you can leave. Please. Is that enough? You're bullying me like this. The Chu family won't let you off. Sir. Thank you for earlier. I'll pay you back as soon as I can. Assistant. Yes. Take her to the car. Godmother. What's going on? Brother , he's bullying me. You have to help me! Ayu isn't that kind of person. What exactly happened? Ayu. Do you know each other? He's the good brother I've mentioned to you before. My good brother, Lu Chiyu . You, you. Take the time to manage your sister well. Otherwise, it will damage the Chu family's reputation. Enough of this. I'm going to get married. Auntie is leaving first. Oh. Getting married. Yaoyao. You' re not that young anymore. Every action you take outside represents the face of the Chu family. In the future, make sure not to act recklessly. Do you understand? I understand, godmother. Let's go, Mom. We're going to the hospital. Hypocritical. If I were Chu family's biological daughter, you wouldn't talk to me like this. It's him. He's the uncle from that night. It's you. No, it's not me, it's not me. The one grandma mentioned was you. You're carrying my child. Sir. You are carrying the Lu family's offspring. He should have a rightful identity. So should you. Sir. We're not familiar with each other. Do you want to marry me? But. .. No buts. We're going to get our marriage license now. And I also promised grandma. To treat you well. Grandma is really good to me. And also, I really hope. The baby can be born healthy. Put it on. Okay. Newlyweds, take your seats. Come closer. Groom, a little closer. No problem, relax. Relax. Smile. A little closer. A little more intimate. Good. 3, 2, 1. Thank you. Mr. Lu, after the baby is born, let's get a divorce. Okay? Why? I've been to your house. I know your family background. It's too much for me. I won't cling to you. After the baby is born , we'll get a divorce. Divorce? Yes. We don't have any feelings for each other anyway. I know. You're only getting married because Grandma is forcing you. I won't bother you. What did you just say? Divorce. You... How can you say that? Let's formally introduce ourselves. I'm Lu Chiyu. Your legal husband. Divorce is not an option. For me, Lu Chiyu, there's only widowhood, no divorce. But. .. A marriage without love is like a tomb. So, I'll make you fall in love with me. Tang... Tang... Grandma. We're back. Good, good. Tang Tang, are you tired? Quickly take her upstairs to rest. Okay. Tang Tang, let's go back to our room, okay? Okay. Let's go. Ah Su, what do you make of this brat? What's going on? Wasn't he very resistant to marriage and averse to girls? Look at him, holding Tang Tang's hand so naturally and happily. He's like a lovesick puppy. Haha. Madam, it's clear Mr. Lu really likes Miss Li. Hmm Yes He has figured it out Tang Tang is a good girl And now she has A Yu's child We Lu family Should cherish her even more But This child is so sensible it breaks my heart I wonder what she has been through A Su Look into Tang Tang's background It's the old lady Are you tired? Mm Sir You Sleep When you wake up A doctor will check on you You and the baby Both need to be well Mm Said Sir I investigated as you instructed The lady is the eldest daughter of the Li family Li family Has business dealings with the Lu family That Li family Yes Miss Li had a very hard time in the Li family Being bullied by her stepmother and sister Not enough to eat or wear Tuition and living expenses All earned by herself through work That day Miss Li came into your room It was indeed an accident Miss Li's family Wanted her to marry the president of Liu family She didn't want to So she ran away That day she was forced to drink so much If she hadn't run away Completely stop cooperation with Li family As for Liu family Make them disappear from the capital Understood In the future I will take good care of you I won't let you be bullied Uncle What did you just call me? Mr. Lu President Lu Call me husband Hu~ Husband Mm We are already married It's normal to call me husband What's wrong with that? But I I can't bring myself to say it If you can't say it, that's fine You can call me A Yu Or Lu Chi Yu is also fine But you cannot call me uncle Then I'll call you Lu Lu Chi Yu Is that okay? Mm Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Did I sleep too long? I'm really not usually like this. It's okay. This is your home. Whenever you want to sleep, sleep as long as you want. It's all good. Tang. You don't have to be so careful with me. You're my wife. Everything here is yours. Home. It's been a long time since anyone has said that word to me. I... I understand. Thank you. No need to thank each other between husband and wife. If you want to thank me, you can . Consider this kiss as a thank you. Don't worry. I'll make those who hurt you regret coming into this world, regret being born human. What are you spacing out for? Why are you kissing me again? This kind of thing will happen often in the future. You need to get used to it. Sir, the doctor is here. Okay, I know. Let's go. Madam. Sir. The young madam and the fetus are both very healthy. The fetus is also developing well. That's great. So is there anything we need to pay attention to? The young madam is just too thin. She needs more nutrition. She also needs to go to the hospital for regular prenatal checkups. Go tell the kitchen from now on, every day to make nutritious meals for Tang Tang. Sea cucumber, shark fin, bird's nest, all of them. Yes, Madam. Tang Tang. I will accompany you to every prenatal checkup. If you feel any discomfort, tell me right away. Okay. Okay. This disobedient girl! How dare she not answer my calls! Sister, where are you going? Dad. If we can't find sister, how are we going to explain to Mr. Liu? I don't want to marry Mr. Liu. Yueyue, don't worry. Mom won't let you marry him. Honey, hurry up and find her! She can't run away. As long as she hasn't left Beijing, we'll find her sooner or later. Li Tangtang, everything in the Li family is mine. And you, are only worthy of marrying that fat pig. Exchanging money at home. Good morning, Grandma. Tang, why are you up so early? You should rest a bit longer. Grandma. I have something to do today, so I' m heading out. That's why I woke up earlier. What do you have to do? Let A-Yu go with you. No need, no need. I'm going to work part-time at a restaurant. I didn't go the last two days. I can't take another day off today. Silly child. You're already the daughter-in-law of the Lu family. Why are you still doing a part-time job? A-Yu, Tang wants to do a part-time job. What kind of husband are you? You let your wife work so hard. You are my wife. I support you. No need for a part-time job. But I don't like being supported by others. And also, if I don't go, the restaurant will be short-staffed. I can't break my promise. I'll send someone to notify your boss. To compensate for his losses. No need to worry. A -Yu is right. Didn't Grandma tell you before? Now that you married into the Lu family, you don't need to worry about anything in life. You're pregnant now. You shouldn't overwork yourself, understand? Grandma , I can't accept that. You're already the daughter-in-law of the Lu family. You should have the best. Take this card and use it as you like. Spend freely. If you don't take it, Grandma will be angry. Just take it. Take it. Alright then. Thank you, Grandma. That's more like it. You have free time today, right? Go out and have fun with A-Yu. You two young couples should go on a good date. You should properly accompany Tang today. Be a bit sweeter. Buy her some nice things. Did you hear that? You're so old, with such a bad temper. If you scare my sweet granddaughter-in-law away , you'll regret it. Grandma. I have a meeting today. I can't make it. I'll drop Tang off at the mall first. I'll come right after I'm done. Go ahead. Alright. You little rascal. I've seen countless beautiful girls, but none can compare to her. Yi Yichiao It's all tugging at my heart. Tang Tang Mm. What's wrong? Nervous? No. Not at all. You're stuttering. Still not nervous ? Is he going to kiss me again? What should I do? There's still people around! I'll go to the office for a meeting first. You go shop around. Wait for me to finish the meeting. I'll come right over to keep you company. Is that okay? Mm. Sure. Buy whatever you want in the mall. Don't save money for your husband. Your husband is wealthy. Super wealthy. Got it? Mm. Got it. Very good. We're here. Mm . Okay. Take it slow. Mm. President. Your stomach issue has flared up again. Do you want to go to the hospital? No, I need to go to the office. I'll handle the business for the next few months. I need to be there for her during her pregnancy. Understood. This is so expensive. A short-sleeve shirt costs over ten thousand. This shirt is over thirty thousand. Ma'am. This dress looks great on you. Want to try it on? Help! What a dress. Eighty-eight thousand! Lady Lu has been so nice to me. I never got the chance to thank her. I've earned a little bit working this time. Perfect to buy her some clothes. Hello . Do you have clothes for elderly people? I want to buy some for my grandma. It's okay if they're a bit pricey. You're really filial. Our lady's collection is in the display window. Please wait, I'll arrange for someone to fetch it. Oh! Isn't that my good classmate Li Tang Tang? Are you working here for the summer? This store really must be losing its mind. They even hire people like you, who can't put on a show. I'm here to shop. What are you bragging about? This is a top brand. You poor thing can barely afford it. I'm telling you, waiter, you're just something else. Dressing like that can still get her into your store. It really lowers the level of this place. Hey. Do you smell that hint of poverty? What level are you at? You think you can shop at the same store as us? Know your place and get out. You 're just being an eyesore here. I came to buy clothes. I haven't finished shopping yet. Why should I leave? Oh. Buying clothes. Can you even afford them? You buying clothes? Don't tell me... You plan to steal photos with your phone? And then search online for cheap knockoffs? Some people... When they do bad things, of course they think everyone is like them. What are you even talking about? Why waste time with her? Just get out. You tore the clothes. You should pay for them. You. She should pay. What can she afford? Her living allowance is long gone. Now it's likely, she can't even come up with fifty bucks. So pitiful . How about this? You kneel and apologize to me. If I'm in a good mood, maybe I'll help you pay. No way. Alright then, you can pay for it yourself. If she can't afford it, you'll have to pay out of your own pocket. You're unlucky to encounter a poor person like her. Miss, this-- Don't worry. I broke the clothes. I will deal with it myself. How do you know I can't afford it? What if I can? Hahaha. I really didn't see it back then. You do talk a big game. Acting all high and mighty. If you can afford it, we'll kneel down and apologize to you. Right. That's what you said. Hmm. This card my grandma gave me should be enough. Whatever. Just treat it like a last-ditch effort. Missy, go ahead and swipe. I'll pay for this outfit. This is a black card. It's not just a black card; it's an actual black card. Let me tell you, look closely. Don't get fooled by her. If she has a black card then I have ten black cards. If you don't believe me, there's nothing I can do about it. Swipe the card. Okay, just a moment. Transaction successful. The amount charged is 50,000. You all owe me an apology now. Just 50,000 bucks? Who doesn't have that? Right. I just don't believe you have money in your card. If you can afford this dress, I won't just apologize to you, I'll crawl three laps in the store and bow to you three times. 150,000. You can't afford that, right? I just think, your taste is really terrible. This dress is so ugly. The dress I needed earlier, is it ready? Just this one. You really have good taste. This one is made from top-quality fabric, tailored by a famous designer. This is our store's treasure. How much? 550,000. Oh no, that's too expensive! But now I'm in too deep. Swipe the card. Alright, please hold on. Transaction successful: 550,000. How is this possible? How can a poor person have this much money? Buy him something too. That way, no one can say I'm wasteful. Do you have men's clothing here? I want the best. Okay, just a moment. Let me see. Hmm. This one's nice. Swipe the card. Transaction of 870,000. Now can you all apologize to me? Why would we kneel for you? Just kidding. Only someone as ignorant as you would take that seriously. Yueyue, let's go. Hey. Who are you? Good dogs don't block the way. Get lost. You think you can just walk away after provoking us, Mrs. Shao? Li Tangtang. Are these your people? What do your people mean by blocking us? Hurry up and have them get out of my way! I didn't expect she has such a fierce side. If you want to leave, you can. But you need to kneel and apologize first. Don't think just because you have some cash that you can order us around. I see you spending money like water. This money must be dirty. I knew it. She's a kept woman. Anyone who would go for her must be a disgusting, greasy old man. Either bald or with a face full of fat. How can you stomach him? Ugh. What do you mean , stomach him? He's probably too disgusting to stomach. That old geezer probably doesn't even have teeth. You're talking nonsense. My husband is handsome and has a good temper. He's very good to me. He's not some greasy old man like you say. You're slandering me. I can let that go, but I won't tolerate you talking bad about my husband. I won't allow it. You have to pay for this today. Ahh! What are you doing ? Li Tangtang! You've gone too far! I won't let you get away with this! We were classmates. I can let this go today, but I hope you've learned your lesson. Don't judge a book by its cover. Li Tangtang! The humiliation I suffered today, I will repay you tenfold! Who do you think you are? How dare you bully my woman! Who are you? I'm the old man you were talking about. That's impossible! Sorry. I should have come sooner. Are you okay? I'm fine. Did you see what just happened? I saw a little tiger defending her husband against outsiders. Just now you were defending me. Now it's my turn to protect you. It seems you people haven't learned your lesson. Someone! Take them to the busiest part of the mall and make them say &quot;Ma'am&quot; a hundred times. I'm sorry! Otherwise, you're not going anywhere. Yes, sir. I know I was wrong. Tangtang, we know we were wrong. Please forgive us. I was blind and ignorant. Please be the bigger person and forgive us this once, okay? After all, we were classmates. The bad guys should get what they deserve. Otherwise, they'll just bully the weak again. Even if they don't bully you today, they'll bully someone else. Alright then. I'll listen to you. Take them away. Let go of me. No. Miss, the items you selected are ready. Thank you. Give them to me. Tang Tang. I really respect your opinion, but this... Isn't this dress a bit... Too formal? Of course it's formal because... It's for grandma. This is the men's clothing I picked for you. I didn't know your size, so I went with the size of the mannequin in the store. That's very nice. This is for grandma. What about your own? I still have clothes to wear. And besides, after a while, my belly will be getting bigger. I'm afraid the clothes I buy now won't fit me for much longer. You silly. You don't need to save money for me. Wrap up all the clothes in the store that fit her size. All the clothes. But how much will that cost ? Besides, I won't be able to wear them all anyway. I'm Lu Chiyu's woman. I never lack clothes. Let's go. Let's check out other malls. Take a look around. Hey. Yueyue. Your broke sister, how did she suddenly get rich? Broke sister? Are you talking about Li Tangtang? Exactly. She recently had a falling out with her family. My dad even cut off her allowance. I haven't seen her for a month. Today at the mall , she spent millions on clothes without batting an eye. She must have a sugar daddy. Shameless. Oh, really. You absolutely mustn't say anything. If others find out, Sister Li Tang, she'll be ruined. Public opinion can be deadly. Got it. I have things to do, gotta go. I've been looking for you for a month and couldn't find you. So you've hooked up with a rich guy. Li Tangtang. You just wait for me. So was Li Tangtang really being kept? No matter if she is or not, as long as we insist she is being kept, then she is being kept. That guy was so handsome today. Why does he get to keep her? Exactly . Public opinion can really ruin someone. I can't swallow this humiliation today. The humiliation today, we will repay it double. Hello. Li Tangtang. You're really not being very considerate. Not returning calls, not replying to texts. Have you disappeared? Sorry. Su Su. I was really busy for a while. How about this, I'll take you out to dinner in a couple of days to make it up to you. Nice try. You've worked so hard for your money, so I'll treat you to dinner. See you at the old place at noon. Su Su. What are you doing? You got out of that car. Yeah. Sister, that car is worth millions. You need to tell me honestly, did you win the lottery? We said we'd never forget each other if we became rich. What are you thinking? When did I buy a lottery ticket? Su Su. I have something to tell you. Hmm. I'm married. What's wrong with you? You're married? So here's the thing, in public, it's so uncultured. Boss, let me warn them. No need. Hey, how can it be like this? Okay, don't be angry now. This matter is already in the past. In any case, I now have a husband and a baby. You really have some guts , to dare to get married on the fly. Aren't you afraid he's a bad guy? At the time, I wasn't thinking about that. And Grandma Lu treats me really well. He treats me well too. And, I can 't bear to leave the baby. Little muddlehead. Aren't you scared now? What if you feel that way after you have the baby? They're kicking you out? No, no. He's really nice. And very gentle. Actually , I plan to leave the Lu family after the baby is born. Still thinking of running away, huh? Looks like I need to make her fall in love with me quickly. Why? I'm not very capable. My family background isn' t very good either. The gap between him and me is too big. I don't deserve him. What do you mean you don't deserve him? Our Tangtang is the best Tangtang. Even the richest man in Beijing is worthy of you . Only you would say that. Oh, right. Tangtang, what did you say your husband's name was again? Him? His name is Lu Chiyu. Your husband... You... Your husband is the richest man in Beijing? You 're kidding, right? Did you get the wrong person? How could my husband be the richest man in Beijing? This photo... Take a look. It really does look like him. Li Tangtang, you're so successful! When are you going to take me to meet him? Lu Chiyu and I had a shotgun wedding. We don't have much of a relationship. Tangtang. What are you doing here? In your eyes, do we really have no feelings for each other at all? I... I didn't mean it like that. We just haven't spent much time together. Then why don't you spend my money? There's so much money, how can I possibly spend it all? I want to save it for the baby. Silly. What's yours is yours. For the baby... Grandma and I have already prepared everything. The entire Lu Corporation in the future will be his. But... But what? I can' t do anything. I can't help you with anything. What if your family looks down on me? What will I do? How could they? Grandma likes you so much. She thinks I'm old and boring. She's afraid I don 't deserve you. Tangtang. Hmm? Do you really dislike me? No, I don't. I don't. And you? I'm so insecure. Do you hate me? Of course not. I'll blame myself for not doing enough. For not making you feel secure. I'll try my best to give you a sense of security. From now on, don't say things about leaving so easily, okay? Okay. Mr. CEO, there's a shareholders' meeting this afternoon. We're running out of time. Cancel the meeting. Take Mrs. CEO home. Oh, no need. I... I'll... hang out with Su Su for a bit longer. I'll go back later by myself. I promise. I'll make sure Tang Tang gets home safely. Mm-hmm. Okay. Thank you then. See you tonight. Tang Tang, your husband is handsome and rich, gentle and considerate. If Li Yueyue finds out, she'll be so pissed. Stop playing around! Something big happened! So jumpy! What is it? What's worth all this fuss? My classmate saw Li Tang Tang at the mall. Guess what? She bought millions worth of clothes in one go ! That's impossible! It's true, Mom! Do you think that little vixen found a sugar daddy? That little hussy! She's really grown some wings. This little vixen is quite popular with men. First, it was Mr. Liu who took a fancy to her. Now she's found a new sugar daddy. What's the use? Once the sugar daddy gets tired of playing with her, he'll dump her. Who would marry a tramp? Mom, do you think she doesn't want to get married and is trying to fight me for the family inheritance? Like she's even worthy! Don't worry. Everything in our family is yours. You're your dad's daughter. She can't compare to you. Don't be angry anymore . Grandma, I'm home. Oh, Tang Tang's back. How was your day? Did you have fun seeing your friends? Happy Oh Grandma This is a gift I bought for you S NIL EDT Please take a look and see if you like it I like it, I like it Wow, it's so beautiful Are you hungry? I'll have the kitchen prepare dinner right away No rush Lu Chiyu asked me to wait for him to come back and eat together That brat is really something How can he make a pregnant woman wait for him to eat? It's fine, Grandma Hmm Grandma, I really am not hungry Ah Yu loses track of time when he's busy A while ago he took on a project Wang Tian worked three nights without sleeping or eating He got stomach problems from hunger And he still hasn't recovered completely You should Keep a closer eye on him He's Assistant He He must be coming back soon Old Madam The CEO has a gastric hemorrhage I took him to the hospital What? I've really never seen you work this hard In just three months, he's had two gastric hemorrhages What is he trying to do, kill himself? No choice Making money to support the family Hey, your Lu family Is well-off You could lie down and still Live comfortably for a few lifetimes Do you really have to be the one to support the family? I have to fight for my wife and kids now What do you, a single guy, know? What are you doing? You say this gastric hemorrhage Isn' t it just a fever? Why are you being so foolish? You've never been close to women since you were young Just one look could scare a girl to tears How long have you been married? What do you know, you single dog? Hey CEO I've already called the old madam The old madam and young madam Are on their way Lu Chiyu You've changed You're sick now but actually told your family Hey, wait a minute What did you just say? Young Madam Are you really here? Brat I told you to eat properly Don't drink alcohol But you just ignored it Hey Now look what's happened Gastric hemorrhage Are you trying to make me worry to death? Grandma It's okay Lu Chiyu Are you in pain? Did you see that? It's still my wife who cares about me. Old Lu. You're just an old bull eating tender grass. Not only did we get married, but we even have a child now. Remember to give red envelopes. You little brat, get some rest . I'll have someone bring food tomorrow. It's late today. Tang Tang and I will head back first. Wait a minute. I'll go back with you. We just got married. How can I let you stay alone? Right? You should rest well today. Tomorrow I'll have Aunt Su make you some nourishing porridge. Tang Tang. Sleep with me tonight. Okay? This... I'm so weak now. I won't do anything to you. Besides , you're carrying our child. Well... Okay. Tang Tang. Don't be scared. You didn't want to stay just now, was it because you were afraid of me? No. I just wasn't used to it. Not used to being with me? No. I just feel that our feelings aren't very deep. It's a bit strange to be together. Who said that? Don't you know how much I like you? Ah.. . Tang Tang. Mm-hm. After you left that night, I looked for you for a long time. Looked for me? Why? Because I fell in love with you at first sight. I wanted to be with you. When I found out you were pregnant, I was really very happy. Because with that, I have a reason to have you by my side. We lived together. But, I know you don't believe me. That's okay. There's plenty of time ahead. Tang Tang, try to let your guard down with me, okay? Okay. Good girl. Go to sleep. Mmm. Stinky boy, get up and eat! Grandma. You two slept together last night? Tang Tang is my wife. We sleep together. Is that weird? Hahaha, not weird, not weird. Stinky boy. Don't you try anything funny. Tang Tang is pregnant. Grandma, I know. Don't worry. Okay, go eat. Try this and see if you like it. I'll go check on your stomach-soothing porridge later. Is it ready yet? This is delicious. You're not just saying that, are you? It's because you're feeding me. That's why it tastes better . Smooth talker. Baby. Don't make Mommy work too hard, okay? Otherwise, when you come out, I'll punish you for her. The baby's still small. How could they understand what you're saying? From now on , anything concerning the child, I'll be involved. I won't let you go through it all alone. No need, you're so busy. Don't worry. I'm very capable. I can handle it on my own. But... You don't have to be so strong. You don't have to be so capable. Tang Tang. You can rely on me. What's wrong? Why are you suddenly unhappy? I'm just wondering how many girls you've sweet-talked to become this good at it. to get this good. I haven't. Chi Yu. Look who's here. An Ning. This is my granddaughter-in-law, Li Tang Tang. Look how beautiful and well-behaved she is. Hi, I'm An Ning. I'm Chi Yu's childhood sweetheart. Hello. I'm Li Tang Tang . Come, come. Let's all sit down and chat. Grandma. It's been so long since I last visited you. You're still the same as ever, so energetic and youthful. Of course. I have such a well-behaved granddaughter- in-law now. I'm so happy every day. Chi Yu, long time no see. Don't you have anything to say to me? Oh No Miss Li I haven't heard Chiyu mention you before I don't know when you two got together You really are something Getting married without telling me This childhood friend makes me feel like I don't even know Miss Li And I didn't prepare a gift No need for a gift If Tang Tang wants something I can always buy it for her They've only been together for a short time But their feelings are very deep Oh right I have some good news to tell you Tang Tang is pregnant Ayut has always had high standards Almost thirty and still no girlfriend Since meeting Tang Tang He's completely changed So gentle and attentive Now they're married And they've got a child The stone in my heart Has finally dropped Hey What's wrong? Brother Chiyu Yes Is your stomach issue acting up again? I'll help you upstairs to rest Grandma I'm going up first Go quickly Rest well I With Tang Tang taking care of Ayut I feel much more at ease Grandma, I've already asked around That Li Tang Tang Comes from a lowly background With such a background How could she be worthy of Brother Chiyu? Ayut's wife Is background really that important? Of course it is Brother Chiyu has a noble status His wife should naturally come from a distinguished family That's how they go together You're wrong Status and power Position We Lu family have all of that Ayut Doesn't need to use these as bargaining chips To exchange for anything As long as he likes her That's the most precious thing Grandma I'm going to check if the porridge is ready Grandma, I'm going to help my sister -in-law Don't cause any trouble for your sister-in-law Don't worry, Grandma Name your price How much Would it take for you to leave? Brother Chi Yu I will not divorce him. This loveless marriage is not happy. I'm doing this for your own good. How do you know there's no feeling between us? Need I say more? You two are mismatched. It's just a fling. If it weren't for the fact that I'm pregnant with Lu's baby, you wouldn't even have the qualifications to step into the Lu family. This is between me and Lu Chi Yu. What does it have to do with you? I know how it is with Brother Chi Yu. He's concerned about the child in your belly. So it doesn't matter. I can wait until you have the baby to get a divorce. Oh. Don't worry. I will be a mother to the baby and treat him as my own. You can forget about that. How can you be so selfish? Brother Chi Yu and I grew up together. Childhood sweethearts. Plus, we're a good match. I can help him in his career. What about you? I can't do anything for him, but just with a few words from you, you want us to divorce? You're dreaming. So how can you get a divorce? Unless he says it himself. This is what you said. Right. I did say that. As long as he says it personally, I'll agree to the divorce. Who do you want to divorce? Brother Chi Yu. Brother Chi Yu. She just said she agrees to divorce you. Shut up. I'm feeling a bit unwell. I'm going back to my room to rest. Tang Tang. Poor girl. Catch and release. I will eventually let Brother Lu and the old lady know your true colors. Tang Tang. Can we talk? Is it about the child? She wants to have the child herself. I will absolutely not give her the child. What nonsense are you talking? No one can snatch our child away. So what do you want to talk about? Didn't you say you want a divorce? It was a misunderstanding. I didn't mean that I wanted a divorce. I thought I did something wrong. And made you angry again. You didn't make me angry. I was just mad at myself. Facing your childhood friend... I never felt confident. Didn't I say it before? My love for you is your greatest confidence. No conditions can surpass it. But... Ah, ah, ah, ah... My stomach hurts. Is your stomach issue acting up again? I'll go get you a doctor. You're my best doctor. You liar . You big bad guy, scaring me with a stomach ache. It really hurts. It's just heartache. Heartache for Tang Tang. You're so good at tricking little girls. You've definitely dated. Many girls before. It's all practice. I've never dated before. You're my first. My first. Why are you so surprised? You're so good-looking. And you're so wealthy. How could you not have had a girlfriend? You're not lying to me, are you? I assure you, before I met you, I never touched another girl. That night, it was my first time too. My gentleness and kindness are only for you. You are my wife. The only exception. You're so good at sweet-talking. I'm speaking from the heart. You're the perfect girl. Be a little more confident. Alright? Mm. Did you draw this? Mm. I love begonia flowers. I draw one every year. Not bad. This... This has a master vibe. Mm. What do you want to do in the future? In the future, I want to open a studio. To paint a lot of the art I love. And hold art exhibitions. So more people can see our art. You're such a good painter. You will definitely achieve it. Really? I'll let you in on a secret. The paintings I want for my studio are already accumulating likes. Now Just the rent left How can I stand on the ground barefoot? Oh my darling Don't go barefoot anymore You'll catch a cold After all these years It's the first time someone has supported and encouraged me this much Lu Chiyu Thank you Whatever you do in the future I will support you It's Susu You two chat first I'll go check on Grandma Do you need any help? Hmm Alright Hey How's it going with Lu Chiyu? He is really nice to me And he says I'm his first crush I think I might like him a bit Wow, it's over You've fallen in love Oh right Are you coming to school tomorrow ? Of course I am I've missed so many classes from my part-time job I have to catch up before finals Otherwise, the advisor will really scold me Oh right There's something you need to be mentally prepared for Recently, our school has been spreading rumors about you saying you are being kept by someone off campus that you took leave recently to accompany your benefactor I can't believe it I almost want to argue with them Just ignore them The truth will out As long as you understand me Alright then , see you tomorrow Yeah, see you tomorrow, bye Hey, little heartless one You just leave like that? I won't see you all day today Just a kiss Is that too much to ask? Not enough kisses Want to do it again? Take it slow Hmm You've been getting along well with Lu Da lately Your lips must be sore Oh Susu, stop saying that Alright, alright I won't tease you anymore Where's Lu Da? Didn't he come in with you? He's so busy I'm capable of moving myself Why does he need to tag along? These rumors lately Li Yueyue was the loudest. Look at her just now. She's definitely up to no good. Last time she made us look so bad at the mall . Don't blame me this time. Here she comes. Remember what we're going to say? Don't worry. This time I'll make that brat stink so bad she won't be able to wash it off even if she jumps in the Yellow River. Ting. Well, well, well. Isn't this Li Tangtang? Done entertaining your sugar daddy? Back so soon? Oh my. You look a little different. Huh. Don't tell me you got plastic surgery. Going to such lengths just to hook a man. Sister, you're finally back! Where have you been these past two months? Mom, Dad, and I were so worried about you. Skip the sisterly love act. Just get to the point. Spit it out. If not, get lost. What's going on? Li Tangtang, when did you get so bold? Sister, I'm genuinely concerned about you. Don't misunderstand me. Do I look like I need your concern? Susu, let's get away from her. She's disgusting. I feel like I'm going to puke. Okay. Wait. Sister, Dad knows about you and that old man. He knows everything. He's more than twenty years older than you, but Dad said as long as you like him, you two can get married. So her sugar daddy is that old? How can she stomach him? What do you mean, stomach him? It's not just stomaching him, she's going to marry that old man! His kids are probably older than her. She seems so pure on the surface. Who knew she was like this underneath it all? Li Tangtang, you're shameless! Are you sure you want to spread these rumors about me? I'm just concerned about you. It's just... if you weren't being kept by someone, why wouldn't you come home for two months? If you weren't with your sugar daddy, why would you take such a long break? Okay. Then I'll call the police now. If you're Xie Bang. Then I want you to rot in jail. Li Tangtang. What are you doing? What's up? Aren't you calling me sister anymore? I was wrong . I misunderstood you. Sister. Can you not call the police? Why does Li Yueyue look so guilty? The moment Li Tangtang mentions the police, she gets so scared. Turns out all those things she said were all just rumors. You.. . Aren't you the best at acting? Pretending to have a deep sisterly bond with me, and then turning me into the ungrateful daughter. The gold digger. Making everyone abandon me, and insult me. Li Yueyue, is that your intention? Hmm. That's not it. Sister. I never thought that way. You misunderstood me. You've always loved to deceive me since we were kids. And then frame me. I won't argue with you. I won't expose you . You think I'm an idiot, huh? It really is a rumor. Li Yueyue is so disgusting. Then you should call the police. We'll all testify for you. No, that's not how it is. Su Su. Don 't listen to her, let's go. Li Tangtang, You made me suffer such humiliation. I will definitely not let you go. What are you looking at? Don't get angry, don't get angry. Tangtang, I feel like , you seem to have changed into another person. Huh? What do you mean? Just that, you used to be so gentle, not like today when you're throwing a fit. And making Li Yueyue apologize to you. Before, I was too weak, always enduring. Instead, it made Li Yueyue even worse. Now I have a baby, I don't want to be a weak mother. I want to protect my child. That's great, you should've done this earlier. You don't have to endure anymore. Now you have Boss Lu. No matter what you do, he'll have your back. Really? Do you really think so? He'll back me up. If he doesn't back me up, where did the baby in your belly come from? Ah! Su Su! Stop right there! I'll tear your mouth apart! Su Su! No, no! Tang Tang, look! Your Mr. Lu is here to pick you up. Mr. Lu is really good to you. Go on! See you tomorrow! Why are you here? I thought you had a social engagement tonight. Even the biggest social engagement can't stop me from picking up my wife. In this moment, I think I suddenly see what happiness looks like. Let's go. Lu Chiyu! Let me out of the car! No way. You kissed me so hard this morning that my lips were swollen. Su Su even laughed at me. Then this time, I can be gentler. I don't believe you. Let me out of the car! Tonight, we'll kiss at home. We can kiss for as long as we want. Okay? Well... That's what you said . Alright. It's really hard to get ahold of you. What have you been busy with lately? Hmm. Busy with my wife. I'm not going to drink this now. Didn't Chu Yan tell you? My wife is pregnant. You were serious that day when you said you were getting married? Oh. Let me meet her sometime. Let me see what kind of girl has you so smitten. There will be plenty of opportunities. Oh, right. What did you want to talk about today? I mentioned to you before that I have a lost sister. I've been looking for her for many years, but haven't found her. Recently, my mom mentioned that someone looks a lot like her. I don't know if it's because she's so lovesick that she's hallucinating. But I'd like you to help me find out how old she is. Twenty. I also wonder how she's been living all these years. You know, it's just the two of us brothers in our family. No girls. If I can find my biological sister this time, I will definitely spoil her. Biological sister. I don't remember you having a sister. What's her name? Something Yao. That was a temporary adoption by my dad to spare my mom's feelings. She's not my biological sister. We don't have any feelings for each other. Alright. Send me her personal information. I'll help you look for her. Thanks, bro . You're welcome. Tang Tang has suffered quite a bit in the Li family these years. I should treat her better. It looks like it's going to rain outside. I'll talk to you later. I need to go home and keep my wife company. I'm off. Oh no. What a heavy rain. I wonder how Lu Chiyu is doing. Is it safe on the road? Madam. You should get specifically some rest. The young master instructed me not to let you stay up late. It's not good for your health. I want to wait until he comes back before I sleep. Do you know where he is? Uh... Mr. Lu seems to have some social events today. I'm not sure exactly what . I don't know either. Okay, Aunt Su. You should also get some rest. I'll sleep soon. Okay. Madam. Make sure to rest early. He's so busy. Should I message him? Would that seem too clingy ? Would he think I'm annoying? This car is exactly the same as Lu Chiyu's. Could it be... Something happened to him? Pick up the phone! Lu Chiyu! He better not be in trouble. What's going on, President ? How long until arrival? My phone's out of battery. About ten minutes. That's good. I wonder how she's doing at home. Does she miss me? Madam, where are you going? The young master specifically instructed that you must not wander around at night. I'm just stepping out for a bit. I will be back soon. Oh. Lu Chiyu! I'm coming to find you! You must be okay! That's Lu Chiyu's car. He's fine. Tang Tang. Lu Chiyu . You're okay. That's great! Tang Tang. What were you doing in such heavy rain? Oh no. Madam. I finally caught up with you. Young Master, you're back. Aunt Su. Why didn't you look after the lady? Let her sneak out. It's not Aunt Su's fault. I ran out by myself. Why are you being so disobedient? Going out like this! I just saw the news. I was worried. And then... I panicked and came out. I'm sorry. I won't do it again. CEO, this is the news from earlier. You were worried about me. Mm-hmm. Silly. I won't be in any danger. I still want to grow old with Tang Tang. You've been in the rain for so long. You should hurry and take a shower. Otherwise, you'll catch a cold. What? It can't mean what I'm thinking, right? He... He wants to take a shower with me. No need. I can wash by myself. With a belly this big, I just can't relax. Come on. No. Tang Tang. You are my wife. You are the closest person to me. Why are you so guarded against me? I... That's not it. It's... I have stretch marks on my belly. They're ugly. Tang Tang. You're wrong. Stretch marks are not ugly. They're actually very beautiful. They are the most beautiful medals you earn as a mother. In the future, whenever I see them, I'll remember how brave Chang Tang was. How much pain she endured for our baby with her tiny body. Li Tang Tang. You make me so angry! What happened? Who made Yue Yue this upset? Who else could it be? Isn't it that Li Tang Tang? She went too far. What happened? My good daughter has upset me like this. She slandered me in public. She embarrassed me. She even made me apologize to everyone. Oh my. How am I supposed to face people at school in the future? What a bold move. Yueyue, don't worry. Mom will make her pay for this. Take it away. Honey. Why are you so unhappy? Did something happen? The company's liquidity is running low. I've tried every method. We're still short by ten thousand. It's all that Li Tangtang's fault. If she had just married President Liu honestly, could the Li family really be short on money? Without President Liu, are there no other presidents? Are you saying... this? Isn't this going a bit too far ? Leave this to me. You don't have to worry about it. Just wait to collect the money. Mom. You haven't had dinner again. How about some milk? Tangtang. Tangtang, you're back. How have you been all these years? Have you suffered? Come here. Let me take a look. Mom. It's me. Yao Yao. Did you forget again? Call me godmother. Got it. Godmother. I'm going back to my room now. You should rest well. Didn't I tell you before? Not to call me. Go ahead. What's going on this time? The Chu family has been making some big moves lately. The boss suspects Chu Xiao is up to something. You need to hurry and steal the data. The Chu family is on guard against me like I'm a thief. It's not that easy. We sent you into the Chu family to replace Chu Tangtang. It's not for you to enjoy. All these years, we've paid so much. You can't even get them to trust you. The boss is very disappointed. If you can't get the data, you're no longer valuable. You wouldn't want the Chu family to know that you're a commercial spy sent by a rival, would you? Enough already. I'll do it. Mom's health lately has been getting worse and worse. I'm scared. Actually, Mom is in pretty good health. It's just that all these years there's been no word from my sister. It's this heartache that has dragged her down. When my sister was born, I said I would earn money for her. And I wanted to protect her safety. But then, the next day she went missing. My initial intention of becoming a doctor was to keep my sister healthy and safe. I don't even know where she is now. How she's doing. Oh, right. I recently discovered something. It's quite odd. I want to hear your thoughts. What is it? I've been secretly investigating the business layout of the Chu family. I found some confidential details that keep getting anticipated by the competitors. Isn't that obvious? There must be a traitor in the Chu family. A traitor? I've seen several business war dramas, in such situations, there must be a traitor. Moreover, the traitor could be right here, listening to us talk. Brother, you should have your men investigate thoroughly. They're all professionals. They will definitely find the traitor quickly. Okay. I'll send someone to do it. Starting tomorrow, we'll fully devote ourselves to finding my sister. Mom's health is deteriorating. I' m worried if we can't find my sister soon, Brother, don't worry. I'll do my best. Thank you for your hard work. Let's go. Since you all don't see me as your real sister, don 't blame me for being heartless. Once the Chu family falls, I'll get my share. It's rare that school ends early today. How about we go shopping together? I won't be going. I still have a lot of homework to finish for finals. I need to catch up on everything now. Alright then. Didn't your husband come to pick you up? How about I give you a ride home? No need. I can just take a cab home. You go have fun. Alright then. I'm off to shop. I'll check out some nice clothes. Little shoes I'll buy them for the baby Yeah You're so nice I'll be leaving now, bye Okay, bye Ah Yu, I got out of school early today I'll take a taxi home later You don't have to pick me up Ah Mom Are you sure this time there won't be any problems? Of course That big shot is no ordinary wealthy person His methods are not something an ordinary person can handle What methods? What are you asking about, little girl? It's none of your business In any case, you don't have to worry That Li Tangtang will go and not come back This batch of goods is nice Definitely a pregnant little girl After all, Master Zhong likes this kind Of course If I had ten times the courage I wouldn't dare to fool Master Zhong The seller said Master Zhong Can do whatever he wants But Here are twenty million Once the money is taken The person is ours As for whether they live or die You have no right to ask Don't worry, don't worry I understand the rules I'm off Master Zhong You messed up my rhythm I brought the person How can this be? If you block it, how can I play? This batch of goods is good It's what I like This is still a feisty little wildcat Rude Come here Say something Let me hear your voice Don't touch me Master Zhong This girl is quite fierce Yeah She has a strong temperament now Just wait Soon enough she'll be crying and begging me That'll be more interesting My husband is Lu Chiyu I'm pregnant with his child If he finds out He definitely won't spare you Oh I'm so scared I actually kidnapped the wife of the richest man in the capital This, this, this isn't a disaster? You let me go now. I can still choose not to answer. It's quite well written. Who doesn't know? The eldest of the Lu family can't have heirs. He can't have children. Why are you standing there? Chase! You guys go ahead. I'm heading home first. It's still early. Why the rush? It's been a while. Let's chat a bit more. My wife is still waiting for me. I'm leaving now. Who told me at first that I would be completely controlled by my wife? I wouldn't have believed it even if you beat me. What kind of girl makes you think so highly of her? It's her. She's one of a kind in the world. You don't understand. Alright, alright. I know you're in love. Just don't show off. Okay then, I'll see you off. Sure. Alright. No need to see me off, just go back. I 'll at least walk you down. Lu Chi~ What's wrong? What are you looking at? I think I just heard Tang Tang's voice. Really? Didn't you tell me she was at home? How could she be here? Maybe I miss her too much. Oh right. The pastries here are pretty good. Why not bring some back for her. I'll ask her what she wants to eat. Why isn't she answering the phone? No, V. Get someone here . Mr. Lu. Search each room for me. Yes. Let go of me. Little sister, struggling has its limits. Master Zhong. I like girls with a nurturing instinct. Still trying to run? Really hard to find something wild. I just like your type. Lu Chi Yu. Where are you, Lu Chi Yu? Lu Chi Yu! Tang Tang! Lu Chi Yu, why did you only just arrive? Tang Tang. Tang Tang, it's me. Don't be afraid, Tang Tang. I'm so scared. Tang Tang, let's go home. Let's go, Tang Tang. Stop! Put her down! It's you! You kidnapped my woman! I paid for her. This woman is mine. How dare you oppose the Zhong family? Who do you think you are? Someone! Insolent! Are you trying to make an enemy of the Zhong family? The Zhong family... Very well. Investigate all criminal evidence Before dawn... make the Zhong family disappear . Wait. Who are you? The Lu family of Jingcheng. Lu Chiyu. The Lu family of Jingcheng... It's all over. This girl looks so familiar. I think I've seen her somewhere. Lu Chiyu? Is it really you ? I'm scared. Tangtang. Don't be afraid. It's okay now. I'll protect you from now on. It's all my fault. What happened? Examine her. And the baby. Okay. Dr. Chu? Is there something wrong with the baby? Is there? Is there something wrong with the baby? The baby is fine. Don't worry. Ms. Li is fine physically, but she's a little shaken up. Stay with her for a few days. I 'll go prescribe some medicine. Okay. Tangtang. I'll protect you. I'll always be here for you. I believe you. So... shall we lie down and sleep? Okay. Don't worry. I' ll always be here. Get some sleep, okay? I'll be right here with you. Always. What's wrong? There's something wrong with the Not wrong, it's great! Look at you! Very productive! What do you mean? Congratulations! Ms. Li is having triplets. Triplets? Why didn't we detect it earlier? Probably because Ms. Li is so thin, and it was early in the pregnancy. The other two embryos weren't 't Now we can confirm it's triplets. No problem What about before? I always thought you wouldn't have children. Didn't expect this. Not only do you have one, but you're having triplets. Can you reduce the number of fetuses? It's a blessing others can't even ask for, triplets. Why would you want to reduce them? Triplets. It's too much of a burden for Tang Tang. I'm afraid her body can't take it. It seems you really like this girl. She's my wife. Of course, I prioritize her. Alright. Reducing the number of fetuses isn't out of the question. But this, needs to respect the wishes of the pregnant woman. You can't force her to decide. I know you mean well. But have you asked her? What if she doesn't want to? You, should really ask Miss Li first. This can only be done with her consent. Only then can the surgery be performed . Alright. I'll consult her opinion. Ah Yu, find out the details. Miss Li was indeed sold by her mother. For two hundred thousand. Sold to Zhong Xian. Who is this Zhong Xian? Why does the name sound so familiar ? He's a scumbag and a pervert. He usually enjoys engaging in some twisted games. Girls targeted by him either jump off buildings or commit suicide. This time, if it weren't for Ah Yu arriving in time, the consequences would be unimaginable. Ah, right. And that Li Boshen, he's also a piece of work. How could he let his daughter be bullied under his nose? I really doubt if Miss Li is his biological daughter. Tonight's events, I will make them pay the price. You, like a child. Come here and wipe this. Just thinking about Li Tang Tang getting in trouble makes me happy. Mom. Do you think she is really done for? Ting. Don't worry. This time, she's in Zhong Ye's hands. She won't die, but she'll suffer a lot. Didn't expect that the worthless girl would be so valuable. Two hundred thousand! Just don't know if Dad will feel soft-hearted and regret it. Regret What good is regret? People have already been sent away. Can they still be brought back? Moreover, She's not your dad's biological daughter. What? You've already grown up. Knowing it doesn't matter. She's just our Li family's adopted daughter. You are your dad's biological daughter. The only precious daughter. Eat. What time is it, still drinking coffee? You'll be dead from a heart attack soon. Can't you hope for me a little? I'm just sharp-tongued but soft-hearted, okay? What's up? No news about your sister yet? There are no obvious traits for my sister. Finding her is like looking for a needle in a haystack. It's too hard. Didn't mom say there was a gemstone necklace with sister when she was abandoned? We can inquire if anyone has seen it. You don't need to tell me that. I've checked all the pawn shops and auctions. I've looked everywhere. Still no news. I don't even know how my sister is doing now. God bless. Please let her not encounter a family like the Li's. What nonsense are you saying? Sister is so cute. She'll definitely meet someone who loves her. Hey. I didn't have a chance to take a picture of sister back then. Now finding her is difficult. I think I recently saw someone who looks a lot like our mom. Just for a moment, I can't remember who it was. I also felt that way recently. Lu Chiyu. Where are you? Lu Chiyu. Where are you going? Where have you been? I want to find you. I bought you breakfast. Oh. What's wrong? Why are you so dependent on me? Have you fallen in love with me? I don't know either. Does this count as love? Anyway, when I' m with you, I always feel very secure. How are you feeling today? Are you still uncomfortable anywhere? No. Did they catch the person from yesterday? I want to call the police. They kidnapped me for no reason. That's a crime! They caught him. Don't worry. I won't let them get away with this. They should all be arrested. Don't think about last night. I'll protect you from now on. But... Why did they have to take me? Your mom took twenty million. She never liked me. She only likes Li Yueyue. I haven't had a single good day. And now she wants to sell me to a pervert. And my dad... Doesn 't he care? I'm his daughter. Tangtang... I'm here. No one will dare to bully you. How are you feeling today? If you're not feeling any discomfort, you can be discharged. I' m fine. I don't feel any discomfort. Then I'll go change. Go home early. Grandma will be worried. Okay. Go ahead. Did you tell her? Tell her what? Seriously, dude? About the triplets, of course! You haven't told her yet? Tell her what? No. What are you talking about? Are you hiding something from me? No, no. Lately... Have you felt anything... unusual? Unusual? No. Like suddenly gaining weight really fast, or feeling nauseous after eating? Is something wrong with the baby? Honey... You're having triplets. Triplets? You mean... There are three babies in here? Tangtang... Should we consider selective reduction? We can have surgery and just keep one. No, I won't agree to that. They're all my children. If you don't want them, I can raise them on my own. I can support three children with my own abilities. Tangtang, don't come any closer. Don't come closer. Tangtang... It's not that I don't want them. It's... Triplets will put too much stress on your body. The morning sickness is too severe. I'm afraid you won't be able to handle it. I can. I'm not afraid. I'm really hungry. I can eat a lot. The baby won't lack nutrition. I 'll eat right now. Tang Tang. In a few months, your reactions will become stronger. You might get swelling. You could have insomnia. You might not even be able to go to school. Have you thought about this? As long as the baby is healthy, I can eat anything. Okay. Then I will take good care of you. Take good care of our baby. Mm-hmm. Let's go. Have breakfast. Drink it while it's hot. Thank you. Who is it? I'm here to deliver the discharge report. The paperwork is all done. You should hurry back and take good care of your sister-in-law. Stop nagging. You can leave now. Fine. I 'm leaving. Why not eat a little more? An Ning. What's going on with your family's Young Master Lu? What do you mean my family? Don't say that randomly. Our relationship isn't even there yet. Who's this little fox spirit? Look at how she captivated Lu Chiyu's soul. An Ning, you can't just hold back. You need to assert your rights. Big brother. I get it now. Get what? You're all grown up. Why are you still so jumpy? Do you remember that we met someone recently? Who looks a lot like our mom. But I just can't remember who it is. Mm-hmm. So what's up with that? Look at this girl, she's so pretty. She even resembles Aunt Chu a bit. She does look quite similar. Her name is Li Tang Tang. Our sister's name is also Tang Tang. She looks so much like our mom. What are the odds? I suspect the girl mom said she met before is her. I want to tell mom this good news. Calm down. We don't have enough evidence to prove she's our sister. What if she's not? Mom can't handle that blow. So what do you think we should do? How about this, you go find Lu Chiyu tomorrow. Then explain the situation to him. Let's do a DNA test first. Okay. Let's do it. Whether she's your biological sister or not, this test will never be successful. The Chu family's daughter can only be me. You finally came. What's going on? Why did you call me over here in such a hurry? Is there something wrong with Tangtang? Yes and no. Don't keep me in suspense. Lao Lu, you know I have a younger sister. Her nickname is also Tangtang. She was lost right after she was born. For so many years, we've been looking for her. Oh, what's up? Yesterday I suddenly discovered your wife might be my sister. Hey, you took pictures of me and posted them on your Moments. I've never seen this post. I forgot to block him. That's not important. Don't worry about that now. Anyway, look, doesn't she look a lot like us? You're right, she kind of does. But you can't just say Tangtang is your Chu family's daughter, right? Right. So I want to discuss something with you. Let Tangtang take a DNA test with us. No. Tangtang is pregnant right now. She can't be stressed. How about this? I'll give you some of her hair for the test. But, you know, even if she is your Chu family's daughter, we can 't tell her beforehand. We'll wait until after the baby is born. It's a deal. Honey, why are you so late? Yueyue and I have been waiting for you for dinner. Mom! Li Bosheng! Are you crazy?! Ouch! You hit me! Dad! What are you doing?! Why did you hit Mom?! What the hell are you doing?! The company is being targeted now. All the investors have canceled their contracts and withdrawn their investments. Don' t you know you're in charge of the company?! How would I know?! You! Mom They specifically named names. They said the investment was withdrawn because of you. And they said it has something to do with that Zhong Xian. They said What did you do? I just sold Li Tangtang to Master Zhong, right? What's the big deal? What? You sold Li Tangtang again? You said the company is short on funds. What can I do? But when you received the money, weren't you very happy? Hey What about that girl you sold to me? What's her background? What happened? A man rescued her. Zhong Xian got arrested. He'll never get out. Impossible. Could the Zhong family let Master Zhong get in trouble? The entire Zhong family is gone. What does Zhong Xian count for? You sold her. Just wait for your bad luck. Impossible. How could Li Tangtang know such powerful people? How is that possible? It's all your mess. What do we do now? If the company goes down, our whole family will have to roll up our bedding and sleep on the street. Dad Mom I have an idea. If the man my sister found is really that capable, as long as she is willing to speak for us Li family, we not only won't be retaliated against, we might even soar high. Make great strides! Does she want to help us? At this point, she has no choice. Tangtang is back! Quick, bring the bird's nest to Tangtang. It's the old lady. Haven't you rested well? Why does your complexion look so bad? You little rascal. Didn't you take good care of Tangtang? No, grandma. He treats me well. I have good news for you. What's the good news? Actually, I'm pregnant with multiples. Oh wow, oh wow. Come quick, come quick. Come, come, come, sit down. Say that again. I feel like I didn't hear it clearly. You heard correctly. I'm pregnant. With triplets. Didn't we already check? How did it suddenly become triplets? During the doctor's first examination, he said it was too early. He couldn't see it. Now I'm further along, and I'm getting better nutrition, so he could see them. Thank you for bringing the Lu family such a huge surprise. Young Madam. Asu, Tang Tang is having triplets! It's truly a blessing from heaven! Our Lu family is going to flourish! It's just so hard on her. When I was pregnant with Ayu's father, I felt terrible. Now, there are three babies at once. How can Tang Tang endure it? As long as the babies are healthy, I can endure anything. That brat Ayu is so lucky. What do you want to eat? I'll have the kitchen make it for you. Okay? Here, give me a few hairs. Are you doing a DNA test? There's news about my sister. I'm 90% sure. But before the results come out, don' t tell Mom. I understand. The higher the hopes, the greater the disappointment. You asked me to meet you here? Who are you? I'm Chu Yao. From the Chu family. Chu Yao? The Chu family? The largest shareholder of Wanguo Group. Their four heirs are leaders in their respective fields. Even a student like me knows that. So this is the eldest daughter of the Chu family? Wait. As far as I know, the Chu family only has an adopted daughter in this generation. You're just an adopted daughter with no inheritance rights. Why did you ask me to meet you? That's right. I have no inheritance rights to the Chu family. But there's someone you care about very much who might have them. Who? Li Tang Tang. That's impossible. What nonsense are you talking about ? Now, can we sit down and have a proper chat? Li Tang Tang? You mean she's... the daughter the Chu family lost all those years ago? Miss Guanjin of the Guo Group That's just a guess. We can only confirm it when the DNA results come out. That nasty girl Not only did she hook up with a rich guy, she also became the Guanjin of the Chu family. Why is life so unfair? What? You don't want her to be recognized by the Chu family? Of course not. She has been targeting the Li family. Why should I bless her? What a coincidence. I also don't want her to return to the Chu family. To take everything that belongs to me. Why don' t we cooperate? How do we cooperate? Are you crazy? Let's cooperate like this. Doctor Chu. Here... The president asked me to bring you this sample. Thank you. I was just about to do my rounds. Go ahead. Chu Yao. What are you doing here? Second Brother. Mom is worried you won't eat. She asked me to bring you some sweet and sour ribs. You can put it on the table. I'll eat when I get back from my rounds. That was close. I almost got found out. Really can't wait. Wanting to recognize her family. What a pity. Wanting to recognize her biological sister, Dream on. Hey. Li Tangtang. Get back home right now. If I don't see you in an hour, I'll throw away everything your grandpa left for you. Don't throw it away. Don't you dare throw it away. Young Madam, you're awake. Auntie. Is the sir at home? The sir went to the company for something. He said he would come back later to accompany you. Oh right. What do you want to eat tonight? I'll arrange for the kitchen to prepare it for you. No need, Auntie. I need to go out for a bit. Where are you going? I need to go back to the Li family. I'll be back soon. Hey, Young Madam. Hello. Aunt Su. The president is in an important meeting. Do you need something? It's like this. Just now, the Young Madam woke up and was anxious to go back to the Lin family. I noticed something was off with her face. I was worried something would happen. I wanted to inform the sir. Okay I'll tell the president. Sure. You rebellious daughter. Get down on your knees. Why should I kneel? On what basis? Because I'm your dad. Now you remember I'm your dad. When you sold me back then, what about it? You dare to talk back? Your dad has enough worries lately. You just came back to upset him. It's like I've wasted years on you. You don't understand anything at all. Oh sister, stop causing trouble. Dad has treated us both equally over the years. Do you believe that yourself? Say it. What did you call me back for? Go ahead. Why did you want me back? This girl, how is she different from before? Dressed head to toe in name brands. Looks like she's really been kept by a rich man. Where have you been all this time? So long without coming home. Got your wings now, huh? Haven't you always wished I would disappear? Isn't it just what you wanted? You rebellious daughter. How dare you talk to me like that? Do you have no manners at all? Manners? When she bullied me, you turned a blind eye. When she had monthly living expenses of fifty thousand, I couldn't even fill my stomach. You never supported me at all. And now you dare talk to me about manners? You. Your dad is concerned about you. Why do you come back and immediately upset him? If it weren't for him using my grandfather's legacy to threaten me, I would never want to return to this family. Where's the stuff? I can't even be bothered to argue with you. Where's the stuff? You can take it away. But, first, you need to make that old man stop attacking the Li family. And then give our Li family some opportunities. Old man, what are you pretending for? Just like that night. There's a man who rescued you from the club. The next day, our company ran into trouble. It wasn't your sugar daddy's revenge, what else could it be? You sold me to someone else. I haven't even pursued your responsibility. And now you dare to come and frame me? Nothing has happened to you. What's there to be so nitpicky about? Enough already. Are you done throwing a fit? As long as you make that man stop retaliating against the Li family, and help the Li family expand a few projects, you'll still be my good daughter. Dream on. Since that's the case, don't blame me for being rude. Bring them in. Since you won't listen, then don't expect to leave this house. President, an hour ago, Aunt Su called and said the young mistress returned to the Li family. She didn't look well. Why is such an important matter only now being told to me? Sorry, President, but you were in a meeting at that time. No matter what I'm doing, if it's about the young mistress, it must be reported to me immediately. Prepare the car. Yes. Is this ever going to end? If you don't let me go, I 'll call the police. Tang Tang, as long as you're willing to let that man help, I won't make it difficult for you. Otherwise, if we all just stay here, it's just a waste of time. No way . I won't let him help you. You ungrateful thing. We've supported you all these years. You won't even help by saying a word. It's fine. Then we can just wait it out. For every hour that passes , I'll burn one of your grandfather's belongings. I have plenty of time. As long as you're willing to let go. You shameless one, say whatever you want. Since you don't want to help, then don't think about leaving. When you figure things out, come to ask me again. Lock her up for me. Let go. Let go of me, let go. Hello. My name is Li Yueyue. Who are you? Stop! No. Who are you? You dare... to intrude in the Li family? Let go, let go! Honey. Where's Tangtang? I want to take her home. Who exactly are you? Li Tangtang is ours. She's the daughter of the Li family . On what grounds can you take her? I'm her husband. Do you have any right to search? Search. Yes. How is this possible? You are keeping Li Tangtang. Isn't it an old man? How could it be someone like you? How could this be? Mom. I think this guy is pretty good. I want him. Here. Ah Yu. Tangtang, are you okay? I'm fine. Why are you here? I was in a meeting. Aunt Su told me you came here. Fortunately, I'm not late . What is your relationship with my daughter? Tangtang. What are you doing here? I came to collect my grandfather's belongings. He threatened me. He said if I didn't come, he would throw away my grandfather's belongings. Who knew after I came, they wouldn't let me leave. Don't worry. I'm here. Anyone who bullies you, I won't let them off. How outrageous. Look at this man's temperament. It's not ordinary. I don't know which family he's from, the eldest son of a wealthy family. It's better for us not to easily offend him. Sir, I am Tangtang's father, and also the president of Li Corporation. May I ask who you are? You are asking me ? You wouldn't know. You're not qualified to be a father. Is Tangtang tired? I want to take my grandfather's belongings. Okay. But they won't let me. Tangtang. I'm here. Take whatever you want . None of them dare to stop me. Really? Then... Will you come with me to get Grandpa's belongings? Okay. Stop! This is the Li family home. You can't just search it whenever you want. Someone! Stop him! Honey! No! Tangtang. You used to live in a place like this? Yeah. Before Grandpa passed away, my room was big and nice. Then Yueyue took a liking to it and forced me to move here. All these years, how much Tangtang has suffered... Found it. Tangtang, this necklace is...? This is what my grandpa left me. Isn't it pretty? Although it's not worth much, I really like it. Before, I was afraid Li Yueyue would see it and take it, so I didn't dare wear it out. This necklace should be quite valuable. Shu... Tangtang, this necklace, you should keep it safe. Mm-hmm. My grandpa left it to me. I definitely will. I'll wear it every day from now on. Let's go. Let's go. Stop! Tangtang, if you leave these gates today, I'll no longer consider you my daughter. You abused me, hit me , and yelled at me, and even sold me for money. You have the nerve to call yourself my dad? I don't have a father like you. And I will never come back here. No! I don't agree! Whether you agree or not isn't up to you. Who do you think you are? This is a private matter of the Li family. It's none of your business. And you, you ungrateful wretch! I should have killed you when you were born ! Assistant He! Yes, sir. Here. Inform all the chambers of commerce to terminate all cooperation with the Li Corporation within three days. Otherwise... Is to be my enemy. I want your Li family Reduced to ashes. Yes, Mr . President. Hahaha. Young man, I advise you not to be so arrogant. Just because of your words, you want to cut off the Li family's livelihood? Who are you? You, you... My name is Lu Chiyu. Is that enough? Tangtang, let's go. Lu Chiyu! Honey, it's completely over. Godmother, I have good news to tell you. What good news could you possibly have? For me, besides Tangtang's whereabouts, everything else is meaningless. Tangtang, Tangtang, Tangtang... All you know is to worry about that wild girl. Godmother, the good news I want to tell you is about Sister Tangtang. What did you say? Where is she now? Is she doing okay? I wasn't seeing things that day, was she in this city? Godmother, I see you've been losing sleep and appetite because of Sister Tangtang. Can't sleep. It really pains me to see you like this. It breaks my heart. To ease your worries, all these years I' ve actually been secretly investigating, spending a fortune to buy leads. But seeing you happy, I feel it was all worth it. Yaoyao, you've always been a sensible child. Don't worry, when Tangtang comes back, the Chu family will surely remember your contribution. The Chu family... Still treating me like an outsider. But it doesn't matter. Once the plan succeeds, the entire Chu family will be mine. Yaoyao, tell me quickly, where is she now? Sister Tangtang is now... at the Li family. Get up! The Li family? She's at the Li family? The Li family? Really? Why are you only back now? Mom What's going on with you today? You two young men aren't even as good as a girl. Yaoyao Yaoyao found Tangtang. Yaoyao You are the hero of our Chu family. The Chu family will take good care of you. The Chu family has raised me. This is what I should do. Yaoyao You really have news about Tangtang. Yes. Seeing how upset my godmother is, it hurts my heart too. So actually I've been investigating in secret. Hard work pays off, I finally found out Tangtang's whereabouts. So, where is she? According to my investigation, she was adopted by the Li family. She is a daughter in the Li family. Doesn't that match up? Good job. Your information is quite accurate. You all knew, why didn't you tell me? Listen to me, because the results weren't out yet. So we didn't dare to confirm. We were afraid of getting it wrong. Unnecessary worrying. Mom, what big waves haven't you seen? Since we know where Tangtang is , let's go! Let's go pick her up now. Let's go. Second Young Master, this is the hospital. Someone is here for you. It's the DNA test report. What's there to look at in the report? My daughter, whom I carried for ten months, I can recognize her at a glance. Mom, let's go! Mom! After testing, the two samples are How could this happen? Hey, Mom, hey! Mom! Madam, you're awake. Godmother, are you okay? Didn't you say you found Tangtang? Didn't you say Tangtang is in the Li family? What on earth is going on? Godmother, please don't panic. The Li family has two daughters: Ganran and Li Tangtang. Not the person we're looking for. Then it's likely another one. This is Li Yueyue's. Test report. What's going on? It's her. She is my daughter. So it turns out your name is now Li Yueyue. Prepare the car. I'm going to the Li family right now. To bring your sister back. Godmother. Don't rush. It's already very late today. If we go recklessly, we might disturb Chang Tang. It's better to wait until tomorrow. Yao Yao. You're quite thoughtful. We can't scare her. Tomorrow, we'll pick her up, okay? Let's bring the sister back . You guys go book a hotel. Prepare a grand banquet. To welcome Yueyue. I want everyone in the capital to know that the daughter of the Chu family has returned. Don't worry. I'll call right now. Hey, you take a good rest. Okay. Hurry up, hurry up. A bunch of useless people. Wait until Li Yueyue, that useless person, becomes my puppet, the Chu family will be mine. Right. Book the whole place. All must be at the highest standard. Good. It's been twenty years. The sister is finally home. Big brother, you... Why are you not excited at all? Mom and Li Jiu look so alike. How could it be that we're not related ? How is that possible? But, the DNA test report can't be wrong. Wait. Old Lu, I need to ask you something. Go ahead. The hair sample you gave me last time, was it from your wife, Li Tangtang ? Yeah. Are you sure it's hers? Are you positive? Could it be mixed up with someone else's? I am certain it's hers. I picked it myself. There's no way it's wrong. What's wrong? Oh, nothing. What did he say ? Is there a problem with the sample? It's confirmed. There are no issues at all. But I still feel like something is off about this. It seems a bit strange. Ayu. Is something wrong? It's nothing. Just an old friend. He might have been scammed. You have to help him. That's really sad. Okay. Yao Yao. You finally made it. How did everything go? The plan succeeded. The Chu family will pick you up tomorrow. You're leaving tomorrow? So soon? Can't it be delayed for two more days? Exactly. This is so sudden. How can we bear it? We can't bear it. That's fine. Well, I'm leaving now. You three enjoy your time together. Hey, Yao Yao. Sit down. Dad. Mom. Yao Yao has done so much for our family. Why should we let her down at a crucial moment? Aren't we going to miss you? What's there to miss? I 'll still come back to see you. Besides, the Chu family is so wealthy. I'll be living well there. If I become the young lady of the Chu family, the troubles of the Li family can be solved. The young lady of the Chu family. Dream on! Right? Yue Yue is still so thoughtful. Having a daughter like Yue Yue is truly a blessing for our Li family. Mom and Dad will be relying on you in the future. Okay. I understand. You're so happy about such small things. No wonder your Li family isn't developing well. Don't worry. Once she enters our Chu family, your good days are just beginning. But, I won't help you for free. You all are a help. You've entered the Chu family. My plan is only half complete. There's one more important thing. What is it? As long as it's something we can do, just give the command. I want to make sure Li Tangtang never gets back up. I've already replaced Li Tangtang's identity. What else is there? Fool. Don't forget she is currently Lu Chiyu's woman. That cheap girl is really lucky. How can she have such a top-notch boyfriend? The Lu family and our Chu family have a long-standing relationship. We're very close. As long as Li Tangtang is still with Lu Chiyu for even one day , our plan could be exposed at any moment. Find a way to put this in his wine glass. I don't need to teach you how to do the rest, right? By then, it will be a done deal. With the Chu family and Li family backing you, we'll have no worries. At that point, Yueyue. Li Tangtang. Let's see how you can do well. Old Lu, you looking for me? What's going on? The identification results are out. Didn 't expect it. Li Tangtang is not my sister. You, almost became my brother-in-law. But according to the DNA test results, Li Tangtang's sister Li Yueyue is the real one. I've seen Li Yueyue. She doesn't 't look at all like you Chus. I think so too. But the second one said the DNA test results cannot be wrong. The test results won't be inaccurate, unless there was a switch. Someone around you may have a problem. You need to quickly get another test sample. This time, I'll arrange for the testing. Alright. But tomorrow night is the family recognition banquet. Ah, let's get it done. I'll go. Just to see what they're up to. Ayu. Why have you been so preoccupied lately? Did something happen? Ah. I was just lost in my thoughts. Nothing. It's a business matter. I'm so useless. Making you work so hard. Tangtang. What are you talking about? I'm a man. Providing for my family is what I'm supposed to do. I come from an ordinary family. And my relationship with them isn't good. I can't help you with anything. If I were Miss An, from a family like that, you wouldn't have to work so hard. Tangtang. If a man's career needs a boost from marriage, what kind of man is he? In your heart, am I that incompetent? No . You're the best. So don't overthink it. No matter your background, I love you for who you are. Got it? Right. Tomorrow night, I have to go to an event. So I won't be able to have dinner with you. Okay. Do you need me to go with you? It's just a family gathering, not some Hongmen Banquet. Why would I need my Tangtang to come along? The Chu family found their biological daughter. That's good. After all these years. Your mother must be very happy. Go to sleep. Mm-hmm. Li Tangtang, Li Yueyue. Could it be such a coincidence? Madam. Oh, you don't have to get up. It's okay. The master specifically asked the kitchen to make you bird's nest soup. The temperature is just right. Thank you, Aunt Su. You're welcome. Come out and see me. I'm downstairs. Be good and come out. Why don't you invite me up? You're not a guest. There's no need. What's going on? Just say it here. I came here today to tell you something important. I am not the biological daughter of the Li family. My biological parents have found me. I'll be moving to my new home tonight. From now on, my mom and dad will rely on you, their only daughter, to take care of them. I have severed ties with the Li family . are your parents. You're so ruthless. Are you really not going to care about them? They treated me that way before. Why should I repay evil with kindness? What happens to them is none of my business. I don't care . In any case, I won't be involved anymore. Here. What's this? Tonight, they're holding a family recognition banquet for me. The prominent families of the capital will witness it in person. For the sake of our sisterhood, I'll give you a chance to see for yourself. Hey! Hey! Yueyue, where are you? Mom! Oh no, I need to change how I address you. Aunt Li, what's the matter? The Chu family has sent someone with news. They're coming soon. You need to come back quickly. Okay, I'm on my way. You must come tonight. You'll see in person how I take away your family and husband. It's quite thrilling. I can 't wait. Why is she so happy? Hey, Tangtang. Hey, Ayu. Just now, Li Yueyue said she found her biological parents. She has severed ties with the Li family. She even gave me an invitation. What did she say ? She wants me to attend the family recognition banquet. Going is fine. I'll protect you. What does that Li Yueyue really intend to do? Godmother! This is your biological daughter. Li Yueyue. Mom! Yueyue! My Yueyue! You have suffered. Mom didn't take care of you well. In the future Mom will do her best to give you the best All these years you've grown up in a place like this. You've really been wronged . , Mom will make it up to you. Mom, are you going to buy me a big house? Of course. Mom will buy you one ten times bigger than this. A hundred times the estate. An estate. But that must be far from the city. It must be really inconvenient to get in and out. Mom, I want a luxury car. What kind of luxury car do you want? Mom will buy it for you. I'm so glad to have you, Mom. I also want to start a company. Silly child. The International Group is the family business. You should join your brother. It's much better than starting a company by yourself. This really is our sister. I don't think so. I've been in the Chu family for so many years. And I've gained nothing. This Li Yueyue comes in, and she has luxury cars and mansions. And she can go to the group to manage the business. How unfair. Why is that? Sister Yueyue, you don't know your brothers yet, right? Let me introduce them to you. This is the eldest brother, Chu Xiao. That's the second brother, Chu Yan. Hello, Eldest Brother and Second Brother. Mom, Eldest Brother and Second Brother don't seem to welcome me very much. I guess I will not go back with you. You two little brats, hurry up and apologize to your sister. Godmother, the brothers have always wanted to meet Sister Yueyue, too. They might just not be used to it yet. Please don't be angry. Mrs. Chu, look at us, we've raised your daughter to this point. We may not have any credit, but we've worked hard. Right now, our Li family is facing some difficulties. Can you help us out a bit? Yes. We will be grateful. You raised Yueyue safely. She is our benefactor from the Chu family. We will definitely help if we can. A-Hsiao. I'll leave this matter to you. Got it, Mom. Thank you, Madam Chu. I have missed my daughter's growth over the years. I have missed it all. Who is she? This girl... As soon as I saw her, I felt she looked familiar. Madam Chu, this is our biological daughter. Yes. Godmother. She is the one who does not match the DNA test report. Have you forgotten? This girl looks nothing like you at all. Can I meet her? Madam Chu, this unfilial daughter has caused some conflict with us recently. She hasn't come back for a long time. That's right. Okay then. This girl looks a lot like me. No wonder those two boys Oh, too bad it's not me. I am your biological daughter. She is just an outsider. What's there to regret? Do you like her? Do you not want to acknowledge me? Yueyue. Mom said the wrong thing. Don't take it to heart. It's strange, when Mom saw this girl, she felt a sense of closeness. Godmother, it's also thanks to how much you look alike. Brothers, that's why we did the test report. How did you know? I did the DNA test because we look so similar. I guessed. Isn't that right? If you want to meet her, there's a chance. At tonight's reunion banquet, I specially invited her to attend. Is that so? Then when the time comes, let me meet her. Sister Yueyue, I'm feeling a little unwell. Can you take me to the restroom? Ah, Sure. Mom, you sit first. What do you mean? Why do you to the family recognition banquet? Aren't you afraid of complications? I want her to see with her own eyes me taking away her family. Her lover, her everything. I want her to know that my future life will be a thousand times better than hers. Let's consider this time a pass. If there's a next time, you must discuss it with me in advance. Don't forget how you got all this now. What I can give you, I can also take away. I got it. A foster daughter dares to act arrogantly in front of me. When I return to the Chu family, the first one I'll get rid of is you. Hey. Tang Tang, I've arrived. I'm going to meet a few friends first. You just wait for me in the lobby. Okay, I'll wait for you in the lobby. Goodbye. See you. Oh. Isn't this the eldest young lady of the Li family? I've heard that some people are trying to cling to the Chu family, but they got exposed. It's really embarrassing for Brother Chi Yu. What did you say? I don't understand. Stop playing dumb. You dare to do but not to admit it, right? You're really despicable. I don't understand a word of what you're saying. I'm here to attend the banquet. I don't want to listen to your nonsense. Move aside. Hey. We haven't seen each other for a while, and your temper has grown. It seems Brother Chi Yu really spoils you . But someone like you, with such bad character, is simply unworthy of Brother Chi Yu. Since the first time we met, you have been saying that I'm of low status and unworthy of A Yu. Right. The one who is with A Yu is me, not you. In A Yu's eyes and heart, the person he loves is also me, not you. Miss An Instead of obsessing over someone who can't love you why not find someone who truly cares about you You Sister Oh wait we're not family anymore Miss Li You're here You came to me What do you want Out with it What's the rush Be patient if you want to watch a good show Right? You're the Chu family's newly recognized biological daughter , right? As expected of the Chu family's eldest daughter Such elegant demeanor Looks like the Chu heiress and Li Tangtang don't get along Unlike some people who clearly have no connection to the Chu family but insist on clinging on and even went for a paternity test Don't you know it's embarrassing to be caught faking a DNA test? What does that have to do with me The real heiress is right here and you still won't admit it Let me tell you fake is fake It will never be real Ill-gotten gains will eventually amount to nothing She's crazy What does she mean by that? Could she be talking about me? Who are you? I'm An Ning, daughter of the An family An Ning Chi Yu's childhood sweetheart If it weren' t for her I would have married Chi Yu already Marry Lu Chi Yu? You? Miss Chu I'm helping you teach this imposter a lesson This is our Li family's business It's not your place as an outsider to interfere Leave You're not welcome here Chi Yu What are you doing here? Tangtang didn't see you, did she? Those two Li sisters are crazy Especially that one Just recognized by the Chu family Li Yueyue I was just trying to help her out And yet She yelled at me Are you saying you helped Li Yueyue bully Tangtang? What's so good about that Li Tang? You have to protect her at all costs? Clearly You used to Indulge me I just didn't bother with you There's only one person In this world worth my indulgence, And that's Tangtang. If you dare bully her again, You all will be removed from the capital. You all bully me, You all go against me. Get lost. Seriously. No wonder it's the Chu family. For Yueyue's coming-of-age banquet, They actually spent hundreds of thousands to book the place. They really have strong financial power. We can also find a good match for Yueyue. Our Li family can soar to new heights. Mm. After tonight, Our Li family Will be the new nobility in the capital. We've been suppressed by the Lu family for so long, It's time for us to show our faces. Let's go. Li Tangtang, What are you doing here? You aren't Jealous of our Yueyue, Are you? Trying to show off? Yueyue, Did she bully you? If you dare ruin Yueyue's coming-of-age banquet, Just watch how I deal with you. Before you speak, Make sure you understand the situation. It was your good daughter who begged me to come. Uncle Li, Aunt Li, Everyone here for the coming-of-age banquet Are prominent and high-ranking officials. As the daughter of the Li family, It's only natural for her to contribute to the family And network . Our Li family, Having you as a precious daughter is enough. As for this kind of waste, Not recognizing her is fine. Indeed, Our Li family Has Mingyue, Such an outstanding daughter. The Li family is about to prosper. You wolf in sheep's clothing. Stay out of it. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. You guys... Better keep your word. I'm afraid... You might want to acknowledge her as your daughter, but she doesn' t want to acknowledge you as her parents. Mind your own business. Nosy. Who are you calling nosy? Are you okay? Sorry. I'm late. It's fine. Let's go inside. Let's go. Wait. Mr. Lu. Miss Li. What can I do for you? Thank you for coming to my acknowledgment ceremony. I am now the daughter of the Chu family. You can call me Yueyue Chu. Until the acknowledgment ceremony is complete, you are still a Li. Also, I'm here for Tangtang. It has nothing to do with you. You... Tangtang, let's go. Right, Yueyue. This is a list of supplies that our Li family urgently needs. A list. So greedy. The things on this list... I'm afraid it could bankrupt half of the Chu family. Later, when the banquet starts, in front of all the dignitaries of Jing City, read out this list and make the Chu family guarantee it. That way, the Chu family won't go back on their word. Right. Got it? Okay. I understand. You guys go on in. From now on, the Chu family's assets are all mine. You Li family... won't get a single cent. Tangtang. After all that's happened, are you feeling alright? I'm okay. It's just... the people I met today were all saying strange things. I don't understand. A-Yu, is there something going on that I don't know about? They're just insignificant people. Don't worry. Hmm Miss Li has arrived. Please follow me. The stylist and costume designer are already inside and have been waiting for you. Please. Are you looking for the wrong person? The Miss Li you're looking for Tangtang. I'll help you change first. Later, you'll dazzle everyone. Miss Li, don 't worry. Mr. Lu specifically instructed us to use all-natural cosmetics for you. No chemicals added. Thank you. It's our pleasure. Miss Li, you have such beautiful skin, elegant and dignified. You look so beautiful with just light makeup. Chi Yu. Long time no see. How is your grandmother? Thank you for asking. Grandma is doing very well. She's been wanting you to visit her. Great, great. I'm here to find my daughter. Since she's not here, I'll be going then. I haven't introduced you yet. This is my wife. Auntie. Have we met before? We haven't. You look so familiar. I'm having a bit of deja vu. Dear , is your family from Beijing? How many people are in your family? I've cut ties with the Li family. From now on, it's just Ah Yu and Grandma. I don't have parents anymore. Actually, you could not be an orphan. Auntie, what are you saying? I'm sorry. I just remembered my own experience. I couldn't help myself. Don't mind me. It's okay. My daughter was stolen the day she was born. For 20 years, our whole family hasn't stopped looking for her. Your eyes... I almost cried my eyes out. Auntie, your daughter must miss you very much too. Thankfully, hard work pays off. I found my daughter. That's wonderful ! I'm so happy for you. This girl gives me a feeling even more intimate than Yueyue, ten times more. A hundred times more. Maybe this is fate. I wish she were my daughter. Young lady, I see you and I get along so well. I want to take you as my goddaughter. Auntie, we've just met. How can this be? What's wrong with that? Chi Yu and my two brats are good friends. Our families are old friends. This would bring us even closer. What's wrong with that? I don't agree. Yueyue! Why are you here? If I didn't come, you would recognize someone else as your daughter. Li Tangtang, you, you! When you were at the Li family, you always opposed me. I can forget what happened before. But now, you want to steal my mother from me? How could you be so shameless? Yueyue! So Auntie is Li Yueyue's biological mother. Auntie, let's forget about this. It's not appropriate. I wish you a happy reunion. Be happy every day. This girl is so nice. She's not like what they said, so arrogant and unreasonable. It's Yueyue who is. A Yu, let's go. Stop right there ! This is my dressing room. The clothes you're wearing are mine. Right here, right now, remove your makeup and take off my clothes! Yueyue! Take it off! Yueyue! This is wrong. You want clothes. I can get you some new ones. How can you make things difficult for others? Mom. It's only my first day back. And you're siding with a stranger. Do you really want me to come home? Auntie, She wants and I'll just give it to her. Don't pay her any mind. The clothes and makeup were all specially prepared for you. They have nothing to do with her at all . You're talking nonsense. Everything here was prepared for me by the Chu family. What's going on here? Why is it so noisy? Oh no. What are they doing together? Goddessmother. Yueyue. The banquet is about to start. The host is urging us. Let's head over first. Chi Yu. I'm sorry for today. I'll specially apologize to you another day, Auntie. Li Tang Tang, let me tell you, are you done? If you don't want to be this young lady, just keep causing a stir. Ah Yu. Did I do something wrong again? What, did I offend Li Yueyue again? Silly. It's not your fault at all. Bad people do evil, they never need a reason. Just rest assured, what's meant to be yours will be yours. No one can take it away. Although I don't quite understand, I believe in Ah Yu. Mhm. Let's go. To the banquet. If it's your thing, even if it gets taken away, your husband will get you back. The Chu family reunion banquet is now starting. Please welcome the chairman of the International Group, Chu Xiao, to speak. Thank you all for coming, friends and family. Some of you may know that my sister was taken away by kidnappers in the past. However, after 20 years of searching, Finally, a few days ago, our family was reunited. Today, with all of you as witnesses, my mother, on behalf of the Chu family, will welcome back our beloved daughter. Good, good. Yueyue, come to Mom. Mom. My daughter, Mom finally found you. Today, I want to announce that I will transfer all the shares under my name to my daughter . Good, good, good. Ah Xiao, Mom. As her older brother, from now on, you must also help your sister in your industry. All the Chu family businesses will be unconditionally open to my daughter. Mom. It's so good to have you. Thank you. For my daughter, of course, Mom will do everything I can. Oh, right, I have one more thing to announce. To thank the Li family for raising my daughter, for their kindness, the Chu family will fully support the Li family in getting their business back on track. Congratulations! Congratulations to you too! Why hasn't Yueyue said anything about our matter? Young people, maybe a little nervous. Maybe she forgot because she's so excited. Let's remind her . What's going on? I don't understand. Yueyue, did you forget something? Remembered now? There is something I forgot to say. I announce that from today onwards, I will sever all ties with the Li family. All these years, they've treated me like a commodity. They are not my parents at all. They weren't before, and they won't be in the future. You, Li Yueyue, you ungrateful wretch! Yueyue! We gave birth to you. We raised you for twenty years. Climbing to high branches and you don't recognize us anymore. How can you be so heartless? What's going on? Isn't she the biological daughter of the Chu family? How did she become Madam Li's daughter? Madam Li is so greedy. It's really confusing. No. She is my daughter. She is my daughter. She is not from the Chu family. Security. Yes. She is our daughter. Drag them out of here. What for? You. What do you want to do? Yueyue . She's so scary. The Li family previously pampered her. But who would have thought she would blame her adoptive parents like this. Don't rush. The best part is yet to come. Sorry. I've made everyone laugh. Ever since they found out I was recognized by the Chu family, they have been constantly asking me for benefits. Taking advantage of me. I'm going to cut ties with them completely today. I also ask everyone to be my witnesses. She really is ruthless . Am I turning into a wolf? No. I can't give up. At least right now she's still under my control. I need to find more opportunities to test her later. She must know who the real master is. Sister Chu Yao . Thank you for taking care of my mom over the years. Now that I'm back, I will definitely repay you well. Mom. I'm not familiar with many of the family businesses. I want Sister Chu Yao to be my personal assistant. To be by my side for fourteen hours. That way, I can learn as quickly as possible. Is that okay? Accompany you for twenty-four hours? It's to monitor me for twenty-four hours, right? Who would have thought she would be so cunning. No wonder she is the eldest Miss of the Chu family. She is indeed diligent. Looks like in no time, she will be outshining me. It's rare for you to have such filial piety. Good. Yaoyao Then make some time to help your sister. Yaoyao Are you unwilling? No, Godmother, I'm not unwilling. Everything is up to you. Her ultimate motives can't be ignored. Li Yueyue Wait until you're alone, and see how I take you down. I've never felt safe since I was a child. I want to add two bodyguards to my entourage. And, I want to choose them myself. What happened when you were little left you traumatized. Okay. Mom promises you . Not good. This little girl isn't just monitoring. If we do anything that's not in her best interest, I'm afraid I'll be the first to disappear. Li Tangtang You're my sister in name, but you' ve bullied me since we were young, stealing my things. I hate you to the core. I never want to see you again. Today, on behalf of the Chu family, I'm telling you and your man to get out of Jingcheng, and disappear from my sight forever. What did she say? Tell Lu Chiyu to get out of Jingcheng? When the old man of the Chu family was alive, he wouldn't dare say such a thing. Is this Chu family heiress a little bit slow? You... On your first day back at the Chu family, you dare to speak on behalf of the Chu family? You really don't know your place. Your sister is really stupid. I didn't expect Li Yueyue to hate me so much. The clown's show is over. Next, it's time for the real protagonist to take the stage. Aunt, the Li family has two daughters. One doesn't look anything like the Chu family, but she's your biological daughter. The other one, looks very much like the Chu family, but she's not your child. Don't you suspect anything? Y-You're lying! I have a DNA test report. The test report can't lie, right? I... She is the daughter of the Chu family. The test report doesn't lie. But the person who submitted the report is someone who can lie. You mean Li Tangtang is my sister? Everyone's eyes are sharp. Let's take out the test report and compare it. Then we'll know. Exactly. Right. Exactly. Bring it out. Tangtang. I'll help you find your biological mother. From now on, you won't just have the Lu family, but also the Chu family. They will all be your support. Ah Yu. I... I'm a little scared. Tangtang. Don't be scared. I'm here with you. They won't dare to bully you. Go ahead. So similar. Look at her looks and demeanor. The Young Madam Lu is truly a real Chu family gem. Li Tangtang. You've taken everything from me. I'm going to fight you. I... You've taken everything from me. I 'm going to fight you. Mom. I'm your biological daughter! Why are you protecting an outsider? I've talked with Tangtang. She's a good kid. Not the kind of person you say she is. So much has happened today . The family reunion ceremony is paused. - Once the investigation is clear, the Chu family will hold the family reunion ceremony again. You all... You conspired together to deceive me. I have the DNA report. You don't believe it , yet you trust a few words of her, the second her. Why? Why is she always better than me? Why am I always worse than her? Why? I really don't accept this. Godmother. I will investigate today's mix- up. But right now, the priority is to ask all the distinguished guests to leave. Don't let them see our Chu family's shame. You must be Chu Yao. The DNA report for the Li sisters was done by you. But, my brother has already investigated clearly. There's nothing wrong with the testing facility. Are you suspecting me? The testing facility is fine. But there's something wrong with the samples that were submitted. You're slandering me! How dare you throw dirt on my name ? Watch this. Then decide whether you still want to argue with me. Li Changtang and the Chu family are blood relatives. Also, the two samples Li Tangtang submitted for testing were different. The first sample matched Li Yueyue's. Chu Yao, you! You dared to swap Li Tangtang's test sample! I knew it. You're my daughter. Mom! I've been looking for you for twenty years. We finally met. So that's how it is. It wasn't easy. I didn't 't expect our poor, unloved little thing to become the Chu family's eldest daughter. You're always teasing me. Eldest daughter or not, I don't care. But having such a gentle mother, and a brother who's so good to me, I'm truly so happy. Everyone's good to you because you deserve it. Seeing you happy makes me happy too. Oh, right. Aren't you due soon? Your belly is so big. And you're taking two walks every day now. Isn't it tiring? It is a little. But my second brother specifically told me to walk more. It's good for the baby. And it's good for the delivery later on. It's beneficial. Tangtang, look over there. Do you think he's a little strange? Susu, let's go back. Okay. Let's go . I can't take it anymore. I'll be right back. It should be fine, right? Susu! Susu, are you there? Susu! After waiting so long, it's finally my turn. Susu! Protect the young lady Young. lady, hold on My child Please save my child Tang Tang Hold on It will be okay You will be fine, Tang Chu Yan I'm begging you You must save her Stop talking nonsense She is my sister Tang Tang's condition is critical She needs surgery immediately Alright Brother-in-law What happened? What are you doing here? I came because of last time For switching the test results without permission I've felt guilty all along I wanted to apologize to Tang Tang in person What happened? Young Master It's my incompetence I couldn't protect the young lady Investigate You must find this person for me I want him dead Yes Who is the patient's family? I am How is Tang Tang? Here is the critical condition notice The patient's condition is very critical We are doing everything we can to save her Critical condition notice Please sign quickly They are working to save her inside Don't waste time Brother-in-law Don't be too upset I believe in Sister Tang She will have help from above I I mean Sister Tang Good people will be protected by heaven She will be fine Lu Chiyu You get out here I entrusted my sister to you Is this how you take care of her? Ah You deserve to die It's all your fault My sister I'll kill you Calm down Let go of me My sister is lying there You want me to calm down? Why? The person inside is not Lu Chiyu President This kid is the murderer of the young lady He still wants to run I caught him Speak Who sent you here? It's her, it's her She was the one who orchestrated everything. It's her. It's you. It's not me, it's not me. How could it possibly be me? It's not me, it's not me. How could it possibly not be me? I'm just an outsider here. Chu Yao. Our family raised you for twenty years. We were good to you. Why do you want to harm Tang Tang? Yes. You Chu family raised me for twenty years. But you never me like family. You didn't even treat me like a person. I was just a pet treated raised by your family. I'm not even a pet. I'm just livestock that can be discarded at any time. Yes. I was your daughter for twenty years. You looked for her for twenty years. I accompanied you day and night, and I couldn' t measure up. You only saw her once at birth, a blood relation. You say I shouldn't hate her? Shouldn't want to see her dead? The patient has lost too much blood. Rare blood type, not enough supply. Family, think of something fast. There's no way. She is Li Tang Tang. She has panda blood. Even if you find it right away, it's too late. You can let her wait to die. There is definitely a way. Right? Who said it's too late? It's not too late. Nurse! I have panda blood. Take me in. No matter how much blood Tang Tang needs, take mine. Mom! Hurry! Saving people is the priority. How could this happen? Didn 't she go abroad on a work inspection? What's going on? Why did she suddenly come back? Last night, the madam suddenly felt uneasy. She bought the last flight ticket. Rushed back overnight. Just got off the plane, and she hurried to the hospital to see the young lady. She didn't expect the young lady to really be in trouble. It's true, a mother and child are of one mind. Mom must have sensed it-- that Tang Tang was in trouble. Why is this happening? Why should it be? Even fate is favoring her. Chu Yao. The Chu family raised you for twenty years. And you actually did something like this. You really are heartless. Mr. Chu. I just obtained some other intel. This kid said that twenty years ago, Chu Yao was sent to the Chu family as a replacement for the young lady. She was a corporate spy. Over the years, she stole quite a bit of intel. I was wondering why business secrets were always leaked. Turns out, it was you. Call the police. Theft of business secrets. Intentional murder. Multiple charges. She'll never get out of this. I almost killed your wife. And you just let me go. And you guys too . Aren't you all very fond of Li Tangtang? Why don't you dare to take revenge for her? Come on. I'm not afraid of you. Come on. From now on, you will lose everything you have. And Tangtang, she will be loved by me, her family, and her children. Living freely. In the future, I will often bring Tangtang to see you. I believe for you, this will be the greatest punishment. No. Why should I? Let go. Tangtang. You're out of danger. All three kids are healthy too. Congratulations. The children are all healthy. Tangtang. My daughter. Mommy loves you so much. You should rest well. Big brother made a lot of money . It's all for you. From now on, big brother will take care of your safety. I won't let you be in any danger again. Second brother is the best doctor. He will definitely keep you healthy and safe. Never get sick . Tangtang. A-Yu. I miss you so much. Look. These are our three kids. We will remain happy forever. Never apart. Mom. Hey. Big brother. Hey. Second brother. Hey. Ayut And now the nightmare is over When I wake up all the beauty surrounds me
