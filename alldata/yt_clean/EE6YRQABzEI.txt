'Cause if you think about it, right, there could be some absolute wham house. Like, you're not getting - Yeah, or out of the Hills. - This is a broken man here. [group laughs] He hasn't blinked since we started. - I left my soul in the Hills. [group laughs] - Right now, good team, bad team? - Bad team. - Good team. - Keep the spirits high. You know what, Josh, honestly, if he's put us on the bad team, he needs to watch his - Yeah, this man's getting f*cked- - And he does not need You know, usually I say He should not visit the bad team. - Leave him at area 51. That f*cking space raid ahead. - You can't say this yet, - I'll take it back if, we'll wait.

Keep climbing. - But it could all come crashing down. - I think we are close. Looks like, nothing here is striking me as either good or bad. - I think we'd be lucky to be - No, not with a f*cking Sidemen budget. [Simon laughing] - Might be this house. - Is this house big or small? It looks... - Let's read this first, - I have a prediction now. - Okay. - We've just been told to like, well, asked if we want lunch because it could be a long drive. A long drive would not be to the expensive houses up there.
