As we determine the overall winner, I would have called it a gaping Josh Yeah, that's what I was thinking. You're a Peep lover. I'm a huge Peep lover. What do you love about Peeps? Okay, so I love marshmallows in general. Marshmallows have a several thousand year I think the fact that we have them today, but also a glimpse into the future. Did they plug holes with it? No. It was used to treat a variety of The marshmallow is, actually a plant. They used to soak it in honey syrup, and now the confection that we have I think it's a modern marvel of science, So you're saying Peeps are good for you? Peeps are very good for you, yeah. That's what we all got from that. Okay, they're healing. Let's see our finalists. You can help us decide. Okay. Before you try your collective top four the Proper Marshmallow Fella. Rhett, your faves were the Dark Chocolate and Link, yours were the Milk Chocolate Covered and your collective least favorite were The overall top four flavors, were Milk Chocolate Delights S'mores Chicks, Dark Chocolate Delights Peppermint Bark and Milk Chocolate Delights Strawberry The strawberry is a little surprising to I think what we hadn't done is we hadn't Well, this is just s'mores. Do you have strawberry? I don't know. I don't know if I've got the packaging. This is s'mores. This is chocolate covered. Yes, there we go. This is a top four for people who hate This is very obvious because none. They're all chocolate. They're all chocolate, yeah. You hate the Peep, you love the chocolate. Yet, here we are. Man, I thought we let you down, Josh. But marshmallow goes with chocolate and graham cracker. It's perfect for a s'more. The top Peep outside of the chocolate Gingerbread Men, so. No, Oh, really? I think that, yeah. It was good. I love ginger. I love molasses. Love all those flavors. Also, I think it's. Thank all. Don't you dare. I'm so sorry. I freaked out right there. They are really good. I was going to give them to you. They're, like, really well executed. Also, the Fruit Punch ones are inedible. You're correct. Thank you. Sweet by the heaven, man. I hate that. You hate this? Why? It's an abomination to Peeps. It doesn't have the right Peep texture to Also. It's not a Peep inside. It's gooey and wet. Can I ask, what makes you so passionately against Because it's such an inoffensive thing to He doesn't like marshmallows. I like marshmallows. I just like them with chocolate more. Fair enough. I feel like we can let strawberry go. Yep. I feel like that doesn't make the top Yep. Do you want to try that? Oh, try it? Oh, I've had hundreds of these, man. These are great. These are one of my favorites. You like that more than s'mores? I do.

Yum. Okay, I need you to pick your top three. My top one is s'mores. I think we should do this. My second is the milk chocolate, I think the fact that we got to this point and we've got four things here for Josh Okay. Yeah. And I actually like the peppermint bark and you like it the least. I think we cancel each other out, Make the decision, Josh. From our top four, they're all chocolate and do three, two, and one. That's the only way to make this fair. All right. In fourth place, I knew it. Covered Peep. I, don't even know if that would qualify as I would consider that a Peep product, I'm glad that we had it here. A Peep product. In third place, we're going to go with the Strawberry Delights Chocolate Dipped. I understand it's not a classic Peep. Also, the artificial strawberry, Good. These are two real heavy hitters right I agree, especially the fact that Peeps are a And like you said, not Easter. But they've had a stranglehold in the And then here, s'mores. Come on. Graham cracker, chocolate, marshmallow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The winner of today's Peep off, I'm going with s'mores. Oh, my goodness. A great toasty flavor on the outside. I love it.
