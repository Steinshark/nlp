[Hoft] &lt;i&gt;There are indeed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Think big&quot; is the motto.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;At the Icedome,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the national teams practice.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Figure skating is the sport&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of international success are the highest.&lt;/i&gt; Our Great President Kim Il-sung and our Great Leader Kim Jong-il Even our highly respected has visited us four times already. [Hoft] &lt;i&gt;Visits by the leader are honor&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Athletic achievements don't serve&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but are a service to the nation&lt;/i&gt; Thanks to our nation's fathers' the working class can train hard We are very well prepared so that our athletes for our respected Marshal. [Hoft] &lt;i&gt;Mun Su-il has already competed&lt;/i&gt; [Hoft] What is his A picture with the respected [Hoft] &lt;i&gt;An 18-year-old is training&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;a lightweight,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;However,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;are not allowed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The pair's coach&lt;/i&gt; In Austria, some time ago, we were not allowed to compete We had to go with an older girl instead and did not win anything. [Hoft] When he's out in the world, is looked at strangely by Europeans I think that kind of question [Hoft] OK. If it's about sports, ask about sports. [Hoft] &lt;i&gt;An unmistakable rebuke,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;served with a polite smile.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Volleyball is the most popular&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;our guides tell us.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Tennis is another trend, they say.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Finally, they do permit us&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;We ask him&lt;/i&gt; Our people have to become fit against the Americans. &lt;i&gt;On the outskirts of Pyongyang&lt;/i&gt; Together, we will defeat the enemies. That is our people's first duty. [Hoft] But is he really afraid We are not afraid. We are prepared. &lt;i&gt;In huge arenas,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;athletes train&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;In basketball, for example,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;one of the favorite sports&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Volleyball teams and table tennis players&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;frequently achieve modest success.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Things are different with basketball.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But the coach knows,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the Great Leader's hopes&lt;/i&gt; I would like to compete in Asian with my team to honor the Great Leader. [Hoft] &lt;i&gt;Nothing is apolitical&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Everything serves a higher purpose,&lt;/i&gt; My wish is to uphold the ideas I want to make sure our teams will become &lt;i&gt;The brave new world of Pyongyang&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;As far as noblesse is concerned,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;it rivals Western premium stables.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;We encounter&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;having come here&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Based on our observation,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;those who look on, are common people,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;while those on horseback seem to be&lt;/i&gt; This is the first and only riding club but we are planning [Hoft] &lt;i&gt;and Quarter Horses from England.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;How these noble animals came here&lt;/i&gt; Our respected Marshal to provide each and every Korean [Hoft] &lt;i&gt;The population of North Korea&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It is highly unlikely that all of them&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;This is probably more&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of the ideal country alive&lt;/i&gt; [Ham] He's on a visit by the love of our respected Okay. He's not from Pyongyang. He's from the countryside. Which is Koksan County [Hoft] &lt;i&gt;Mirim Riding Club&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Only the country's elite ride here.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Right next to the huge&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;there is a flagship project&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The soccer academy.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Thousands of students each year&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;are hoping for a place&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Only about 30 children&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;For those chosen few,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;it is maximum commitment&lt;/i&gt; Our Great Leader Kim Jong-il himself came up with the idea In 2013, it opened, and our respected Marshal Kim Jong-un has visited it several times as well. [Hoft] &lt;i&gt;Schools like this one&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;enjoy preferential treatment.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Kids here are between seven and 12.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Not all of them are good enough&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Loyalty to the regime&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;We visit one of the dormitories.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;We are asked&lt;/i&gt; [An Kyong-huva] Yeah, And they have bunk beds, And what else? So the bunk bed is more fun for boys, And more spacious. So they have a little rough time here [Hoft] &lt;i&gt;Ten boys in one bed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;under the watchful eye&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The assistant principal still remembers&lt;/i&gt; [An Kyong-huva] Actually, when our school was established, It was plain, you know. And when our Great Marshall he came here and looked up, and he told us it would be Then students here can train So it's not quite cold for little kids. So we built a roof. [Hoft] &lt;i&gt;A roof for the students.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Kim Jong-un even sees&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The dictator as a caring father:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that is how he wants people&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And they should learn&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and absolute loyalty.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Five hours of practice in the morning&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Light snowfall&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;so they are practicing outside.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Our request to speak&lt;/i&gt; Like I told you before, we have to provide all of the students normal conditions every day. The school doesn't want It's not good for them. [Hoft] &lt;i&gt;Routine aside, the assistant&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;We are allowed to ask one boy&lt;/i&gt; It's just great to be able to learn that the Great Leader built for us. It fills me with great pride. [Hoft] &lt;i&gt;A totalitarian state&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;or even spontaneity during childhood.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;We are driven to the city's first gym.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;We are curious&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The interior is luxurious,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but it is icy cold as well.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The energy shortage&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Kim Jong-un himself has opened this gym.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Red stickers commemorate&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;which of the machines&lt;/i&gt; I am a gym instructor [Hoft] &lt;i&gt;Employees act as guests for us,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;as there seem to be&lt;/i&gt; We have to train our bodies well and to be prepared for the war [Hoft] &lt;i&gt;There it is again:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the ubiquitous argument&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that is injected in people&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Many things are left unsaid&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;To us as well&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;On this trip, we did not learn&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Individuality is frowned upon.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Every citizen&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to the values of the Kim dynasty,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;at least outwardly.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;That is the number one rule&lt;/i&gt;
