This is me with four SAS soldiers. Some of the deadliest men in the world. And I'd sneakily brought them to be on my team, My friends, however, How messy would it get if some YouTubers, [DRAMATIC THUD] This video has been sponsored by Adobe Express. Right. I'm a cross boy. I'm upset, I'm frustrated, I'm cheesed off. And the reason I'm cheesed off, from a group chat with some other mates of mine, They've just all picked the idea, I hate paintballing. Oh! For one main reason: I always get hurt. You always get hurt in paintballing, I don't understand why people Sorry with my opinions. The one thing that is making me relatively happy, one of my friends has said: Don't ask me how, but I think I can bring people, And those people are the Special Air Service, Founded during World War Two, hostage rescue, and covert operations. And as of today, paintball. Using a connection I literally cannot tell you about, I hired four ex-SAS soldiers, MAX: Hello! And my friends, had no idea what they were in for. ZAC: Recruited! ZAC: Yeah! CIARAN: I've been ready since I was about 18. [LAUGHTER] CIARAN: I don't know about you boys, [MAX LAUGHS] ARTHUR: How's it going, mate? MAX: You alright? [MAX LAUGHS] I realised that they were gonna get And after we got into our gear, I have, also, decided today, Just some pals of mine, is that okay? [LAUGHTER] MAX: They are friends, not clay pigeons, [ROCK MUSIC PLAYS] Oh! MAX: This is the people These gentlemen, were in the SAS. [MAX LAUGHS] MAX: Yeah! They've got their faces blurred, We genuinely cannot know who they are, and you're gonna be fighting against them. [MAX LAUGHS] Now my team had arrived, I suited up... It's not even slow-mo. And the two teams got to talking game plans. So what do we do, pack mentality or spread? ARTHUR: I think we spend a decade or two building [LAUGHTER] Right team, what do I need to know? MAX: Stay low, move fast. MAX: Yep. MAX: Yep. MAX: Yes, sir. Are we gonna do a three, two, one, break? No, you're much- No, no, we're not in America. So, here are the teams. On Team SAS, four of the hardest soldiers and me, who has a couple of tours of the Alps with Daddy. We would be going up against Team YouTube: Zac Djellab, Ciaran Carlin, Ellis Platten and Arthur Television. Four individuals who all apologise ZAC: You know what's crazy, Men, boys. MAX: Thanks for calling me a man. [LAUGHS] MAX: Um, OK, are we ready to go? We made our way down to the arena, who was more comfortable handling a firearm. ARTHUR: Oh, they're accurate! MAX: These are really gonna hurt, aren't they? Now that everyone had their weapons in hand, To make this as true to life as possible, which means you get hit once, you're out. INSTRUCTOR: YouTube, head over SAS, follow me. The two teams took their place And they had slightly different approaches... ARTHUR: I'm gonna go up in that MAX VOICEOVER: Despite the impending doom, ARTHUR: I'm in the mood for crime. MAX VOICEOVER: Whereas back on my team, MAX: Yeah, great. So whilst I was going to be a human target, the YouTubers were given some INSTRUCTOR: I don't usually let it's gonna be a challenge, Smash it. MAX VO: So, it was time for game one. VOICE: 3, 2, 1!

CIARAN: Ow! ELLIS: Ah! The only person left was Arthur TV and as I joined the fray, MAX: Ugh! MAX VO: But it turned out I was completely useless. MAX: For [POP]'s sake! With me out, the SAS did what they were trained to do, ARTHUR: Oh my goodness! Team SAS had wiped out the MAX VO: But maybe that was an anomaly, MAX: Same tactics boys? [MAX LAUGHS] Why not? ELLIS: Has he got me? CIARAN: Oh my god. ZAC: Fuuu... MAX VO: Nope, no anomaly, this time it took- INSTRUCTOR: 25 seconds. One more go? ELLIS: Ah! MAX: What a shot! ARTHUR: Oh! I got shot in the leg. INSTRUCTOR: Game over! INSTRUCTOR: That one was 45 seconds. After a number of rounds played, And the SAS hadn't got a scrap of paint on them. And I was starting to feel a little bit bad. INSTRUCTOR: Game over! 25 seconds. Game over! 30 seconds. MAX: First session done. I have to say, I'm doing nothing, first and foremost. Secondly, I do feel a little bit bad, because, It doesn't make me feel great. So, I probably should join them on the next round. MAX VO: Now, with my YouTube brethren... We had one goal in mind: MAX: They all split up, they go- MAX VO: And in order to do that, MAX: Pair up, I'll distract them, My plan was simple, I would be the I would be going on a suicide this would draw their fire, to shoot one of them. I took my place, and I was ready for the fate that awaited me. INSTRUCTOR: 3, 2 [WHISTLE] MAX: Come on. [MAX SCREAMS] I was drawing fire and getting absolutely battered. Ow, ow. Do your duty, boys! But, I think I'd done my job, MAX: Right side, right side, Arthur, right side! MAX VO: Behind some barrels, with somebody in his sights. MAX: Yes! Come on! ELLIS: Arthur's got one! CIARAN: Yeah! [CHANTS OF 'COME ON!'] We had done it. We had shot one of the SAS soldiers, ARTHUR: Me! [LAUGHTER] But there's nothing, that a bit of pizza, can't solve.
