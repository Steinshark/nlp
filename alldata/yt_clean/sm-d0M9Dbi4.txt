[drum-heavy New Age music plays] [male voice] The dingo. Icon of Australia. Noble survivor in a tough land. [man 1] Dogs can go They're not getting their water They're getting their water out of blood and fat reserves [male voice] A friend and The dingo has inserted himself into the ecology. It's the type of country perfectly built for. A wild dog with a bad reputation. Dingoes got my baby. [male voice] A threat to our families. [woman 1] The two children when they were attacked. [male voice] And frenzied demon [man 2] It's a horrible, horrible death. [man 3] All they want to do is kill. [male voice] But could dingoes [woman 2] Dingoes killed within 17 days. [male voice] Do we need them [woman 3] We can recover simply by allowing the dingo to do what the dingo does. [man 3] They're always I believe our only option [male voice] The dingo. Lightning rod of the Australian bush. [man 4] I can hardly see between this dog and my Kelpies. [man 1] There's one real big difference. Your Kelpies love you, [male voice] Dingoes can ruin your day. They can run you right out of business. Wipe out a year's profit [man 4] Walk on, sheep. Walk on, sheep. [male voice] I know. I'm a sheep farmer and dog trainer. My name is David Graham. I grew up farming sheep and cattle. It's in my blood. My whole life I've been taught For generations, my family's trapped, but they always come back. And now it seems like they're [David] Good dogs, good dogs. Steady now, steady dog. [David] Dogs are my life. And I've been training 'em for years. I know what makes 'em tick. I just can't get a handle on dingoes. As a farmer, I fear them. But as a dog trainer, I respect them. I admire their independence. I gotta believe there's a way without wiping them out. [drum and flute music plays] [David] Scientists say somewhere around three and a half Sandy, black or somewhere in between: They're all dingoes. Not far removed Probably brought along or maybe as a hunting tool. When dingoes got to Australia, was the thylacine: the Tassie tiger. The dingo was bigger and a far more adaptable hunter. They competed for food and territory. And dingoes most likely hunted down Thylacines disappeared from mainland The last one died and now they're gone forever. The dingo For thousands of years, indigenous People of the Western Desert believing they kept evil spirits away and warned the camp But they weren't pets for long. When the pups got a bit older, and nicked off into the bush. When Europeans arrived we dug bore wells all over this hot, dry country. Suddenly, there was fresh water The numbers of animals shot up, And we did something else. We brought domestic dogs. They've escaped into the bush and interbred with dingoes. The result seems to be that's spread across Australia. And calves and sheep are an easy target. [ominous music plays] Hey, hey, hey. [David] Today, my prime lambs [indistinct corralling noises] [David] Dingoes or wild dogs, Seems like us farmers are at war It's time I hit the road How big a problem are dingoes? Where do they fit And how can we live together What I'm trying to do here is learn everything that I can and how it interacts across Australia, because it doesn't matter there are different issues at play. [David] I'm heading across Australia looking for a way Or at least call a truce. My first stop: four hours east of my farm It's an area that didn't Until recently. With the drought broken, The numbers of every animal out here Including dingoes. [indistinct auctioneering chatter] [David] You know, Australia But in the last few years, A major change being there are so few farmers in the industry Those that are left that is one from wild dogs, a problem we haven't seen for 50 years. And in each of these pens, you see a farmer's profit or the damage that a single dog G'day, I'm Dave. -Ben Corey, Dave. -Ross Bartley, Dave. How're you? [David] Every farmer here has a story [Ben] I saw, one morning, 30 lambs, small lambs dead, all from one dog. Just went through And is it town dogs that've gone feral or is it real dingoes Real dingoes. There's both. [Ross] You'll see They're probably worse But they've all got the same traits: If you see any sort of dog chasing a flock they automatically fall into the category [David] It doesn't matter where the dog's -If he's killing sheep, he's a problem. Peter, what would happen if... if the wild dog and he wasn't controlled? Sheep are everything to us. We'd lose our bloody livelihood. We'd be finished. [David] These blokes are doing it tough, and the native dingo So Ross, d'you reckon the native dog Well, I've yet to be convinced I don't believe I reckon they're an introduced species. They're always I believe our only option [David] I understand about wild dogs and dingoes. Basic canine instinct is to attack anything that runs away. And sheep, well, they're perfect. Small enough to not be intimidating, fast enough to be exciting and worst of all, they respond to dogs So dingoes don't stop at just one. There's hundreds of wild dogs doing a lot of damage. But it could be worse. There's a lot more wild dogs out there, and the only thing stopping them Only a few hundred kilometers away, there's a thin fence, and that's all that's there. And that's dividing all this grazing pastureland from the wild dogs. I want to see it for myself. I'm heading to a cattle station in South Australia, where there are thousands of dingoes. There's precious few travelers out here. A reminder of just how vast Australia is. What amazes me is how much life I'm seeing It's kinda hard to imagine that all this tough country tens of thousands of square kilometers, with water points scattered all over. And out here, in the middle of nowhere, is the barrier that divides the country. [David] The dingo fence. A few thousand kilometers that way, and you reach my home. A few thousand more kilometers that way, and you reach the Southern Ocean, And through here, I hear there's 5,000 to 7,000 dingoes. [David] The fence runs over One of longest In fact, it's three times the length Begun in 1886, it crosses three states, beginning in southeast Queensland and ending on the shores It was originally built to keep rabbits Back in the early 1900s, that it might protect I can't imagine what it must have taken to build this thing With the heat, the flies and the dust. [energetic music plays] [David] Across the fence Covering 12,000 square kilometers, it stretches to the edge This is one of the largest if not the world. I can tell right away on the dingo side of the fence. I haven't seen any roos, emus or goats. But I'm seeing plenty of signs that this is dingo territory. [David] This is great. You know, usually there's a big sign saying, &quot;Welcome to...&quot; That's exactly what this is doing. This dog's saying, &quot;This is my country. And you're in it.&quot; It's really good acrobatics when you think how high a dog is You get what I'm talking about. [David] I'm here to catch up Always a good idea when you're wandering around their land. -G'day mate. Good, good. [David] Greg's been running cattle There's nearly 8,000 head on Quinyambie. He says in tough country like this, you always lose some calves. The natural losses, Health, accidents, whatever. [David] Greg says stations out here That's gotta account for a fair bit -That's the only difference, is the dogs? [David] What I've seen of these cattle [Greg] They do, The cow cannot look after a calf coming in from all angles. [David] But it's not just Dingoes cause havoc water. [Greg] Here's a good example, Dave, I put this unit out here the other day. And two hours after, I come back, to get extra water, and they'd actually And if I hadn't been here that time, [David] Crikey, so it's not just by killing them and harassing them, it's when they bugger up your wires that you don't have water, [Greg] It can happen very easily. They like playing with things like your domestic dog does. [David] If it's there and it's chewable, [Greg] That's dead right. [David] When the dogs get too bold, Greg and his crew fight back with guns and another weapon: 1080 baits, meat laced with poison. It doesn't take much to kill a dingo. A tiny bit goes a long way. Even so, hundreds of kilograms is spread by aircraft each year And any dog that eats it dies an ugly death. I'm seeing dingoes and it's got me thinking [David] I'd come to the conclusion that baiting was really ineffective with dingoes, and you ended up hurting your own dogs But after seeing It really is the only way. And I think that's what I'm learning, for areas, for certain places. It is not a one... size fits all. [David] This morning, to meet a man This is about as Outback as it gets. In this arid land, water points like this dam Ben Allen researches dingo management for New South Wales's [Ben] Better go check it out. [David] He looks at their behavior, and how to control them He's got nine dingoes out here with GPS collars on them. And the fastest way Ben's radio direction finder but spotting dingoes is another matter. He's around here somewhere. [David] Brumbies! Wild horses. First sign of life I've seen There's one. This dingo is pacing us Nothing seems to slow him down. The stamina of these animals is amazing. Tracking these animals about where they go and what they do like never before. And he's got more collars [Ben] Getting this data I can plug this thing into the computer and get a GPS point for every half hour [David] You can see who he hung out with, when he went and had a drink, And through some of this stuff dogs can go three weeks without a drink. -Three weeks? They obviously need water. But they're not getting their water They're getting their water out of blood and maybe the fat reserves they've got They're not getting it from a puddle. [Ben] We've got collars and we've got that in several packs. [Ben] This is the same map and this dog here and this dog here So the road is really an important feature that separates the pack boundaries. And then you can start pack individuals and packs, and with other things like water points. So you can say: Does everyone go or do they go at different times? [David] This is all good and well how dogs act amongst themselves, but this is a massive, How do the dogs interact with the cattle? For me, To answer it, Here's a laptop. Just a little while ago, I came across this pack of dingoes eating this dead cow. [David] With all the cows [Ben] Complete indifference. Twelve dingoes feeding on a dead cow in the presence of probably 100 cattle, probably 30 calves... As though it happens all the time. As though it happens all the time. That cow's obviously died from something. And there's more dingoes up on the hill. -[Ben] Yeah. These ones were the adults. [Ben] They'd already had their feed. Now it's the pups' turn So just this little video [Ben] Absolutely. We learn who's more important, You learn about If this was in sheep country, that just wouldn't happen. Sheep don't react that way to dogs. Sheep bleat, they form a big group, and dogs just have to kill them. They're hard-wired They see the movement, They have to do it. Which is why on this side of the fence, Absolutely. Dogs and cattle can live together Dogs and sheep just can't live together. [David] To put GPS collars on dingoes, first, you've got to catch them. Not so easy on a station this big. We're checking traps [Ben] Right there. [David] These are rubber-jawed traps. They hold tight, I have no idea how he's gonna I think I'm gonna let you do it. So with this, this knob pulls back, [dingo whimpers] There you go. Beautiful. Pin him down. Drop the pole. She's right now. [David] This is extraordinary. and I can hardly see a single difference [Ben] There's one real big difference. Your Kelpies love you, So we're gonna put this on. So, she's right now. Let's put this collar on. First up, before we let her run away we make sure it's working. [static] [Ben] Wave a magnet. [electronic noises] [Ben] We only keep to be less than five percent so we know they can handle it happily. It doesn't stop 'em from doing anything. So she's all ready to go now. [David] You can see the importance -[Ben] These traps are great. [David] Ben gives the dog's foot a rub to help get the blood flow back. [Ben] Massaging her foot like this compared to being beaten up So they don't even flinch. So she's all good now. I'm gonna give this pole to you. And... what I want you to do and then when you're ready, put your finger in the corner of that tape -You alright with that? Alright. [Ben] Before you do that, Otherwise, she can take something [David] A dog in this situation could have any of four responses: fight, flight, fidget or freeze. There's no way to predict what she'll do. [Ben] She's free, [David] She's frozen. As a dog trainer, [David] Now there's a behavior That was a look away, &quot;If I look away, I'm not going Which is classic dog behavior. [Ben] Very submissive, looking away. All the things that you'd read [David] Exactly. I don't think she's going to go anywhere. What we might do, I reckon, is if we get back in the car she might get up and just wander off. [David] Ben likes to make sure Once we're in the car, [Ben] She'll get hot eventually and leave. Want a biscuit? Yes, please. Might as well [Ben] There she goes. -Just like that. She's had enough. [David] And so have we. We make camp back at the dam. Even with us moving around dingoes still come in to check us out. There's a lot of dingoes They may take a calf, but it's not their primary diet. They're mostly out hunting rabbits and other small mammals at night. [dingo howling] -Can you hear it? It's the welcoming committee. I'll tell you what Ben, if I hadn't actually come out and flown around today So when I tell everyone that there's a lot of dogs I'm not just pulling their chain. There's a lot of dogs I couldn't believe it! And what would happen Would you just get this It wouldn't take them [distant dingo howling] Can you hear that? You should ask them that question; And you can hear their answer. [David] Out here, But they live everywhere in Australia, from the coast to the alpine regions. They withstand the heat and the cold and have adapted to find food in even in the most extreme environments. I'm gaining a newfound respect and the physical traits They're the epitome of a survivor. It's hard to believe how many there are and how well they do They're adapted that runs from dry as dust [David] It's phenomenal and extremely marginal for even grazing, and yet here we are, it's raining. [David] Dingoes have been here They've learnt to ride the seasons and live in balance But when Europeans arrived, they introduced the game changers: foxes, cats and rabbits. And in under 200 years, many of the small I'm headed out west to one place On the other side of Lake Eyre near the town of Roxby Downs, tracts of land are fenced off, carved out of cattle country in a unique experiment: Arid Recovery. Behind the fences, scientists are looking at how the effects of cats and foxes and the role of dingoes. The native species but you can see them at night. Helen Crisp is one She's introducing me to some mammals that have been gone for decades, but are thriving here. [David] So that's a bettong, is it? [Helen] Yeah, that's a burrowing bettong. There's another burrowing bettong [David] They've got no fear at all. [Helen] No. They're so inquisitive. He's actually the only macropod species and they live underground and come out at night. [David] So all these scurrying little [Helen] No, they're spinifex hopping mice. -[David] Hopping mice? -[David] They fully hop. [David] Wow. They're really cool. -[David] D'you reckon I can catch him? [David] I got him! -He is awesome. You can see they look quite different or in the barn or anything. The main difference with these guys and that real feathery tip And their really long back legs. And big eyes. What we've found there's six times more inside the reserve, compared to outside the reserve. [David] I think he's saying [Helen] Yeah, I think so. -We've had a great look at him. Go and make some babies. [David] One of Helen's jobs is to patrol some 70 kilometers of fences. So this keeps everything out: Yup, and cats. [David] As part of the study, they've set traps outside the reserve to learn how much damage feral animals are doing to native species. [David] Oh, wow. A black one. [Helen] Yeah, here we've got a feral cat. We'll dispose of him, and... we'll check out what he's been eating. This one is actually 3.625 kilos. [David] Helen records details to learn what cats and foxes -And this is it. [Helen] It's really full. So because we want to find out, ideally, what species it's really important Sort of like... putting together a jigsaw puzzle, I guess. So what we want to find... are the different legs and tails that belong [David] I mean, they're obviously -[Helen] Yeah. [Helen] Yeah, we've got at least [David] Helen tells me had 33 native animals And scientists estimate there's 15 million wild cats Seeing what just one eats, it beggars belief To test the theory that dingoes Arid Recovery set up another experiment. They put a pair of dingoes Then they introduced cats and foxes. [Helen] With the first phase we introduced seven foxes And over the course of a few weeks, we did find [David] Turns out, that were set loose in the pen, too. Dingoes are pretty good [Helen] So this is the dam And straight through the dunes there, And this area to observe dingoes in the dingo pen. So fingers crossed, we might see some. Oh, wow. So that's the carcass. [Helen] Yeah, we put that out [David] Dingoes eat anything. They're opportunists. They take down rabbits, They eat reptiles, insects, plants, and they'll even scavenge on carrion. And I'm hoping that kangaroo carcass Now it's a waiting game. Trying to keep still, and my eyes open. Dingo hearing and sense of smell we'll be lucky to see anything. -There. Can you see that? There's actually a couple of juveniles -These would be last year's pups? [Helen] Looks like it [David] What's the likelihood would keep observing their pups and be in the local area, [Helen] Yeah, I reckon it's pretty likely. When I saw the pups a couple of weeks ago, The howling was most likely but I did not see them at all. But they are cute. [Helen] They are cute, yeah. [David] I leave Roxby Downs It seems that a healthy ecosystem They keep ferals in check, which helps small native species. And they also keep roo numbers down, which means more grazing for livestock. Now more than ever, I feel that there's got to be a way I'm headed into prime sheep country, the border To the town of Tallangatta. This country couldn't be But even here, they've got trouble with dogs. -[David] G'day, Andrew. -Yes. [Andrew] Come in. I think -[David] G'day. How are you? [Glenda] Please have a seat. [David] Glenda and Andrew Bowran Fourth generation But they were almost Almost lost everything, all because of wild dogs. [Glenda] It was the lambs we lost, and it was the pain and everything else that we suffered, too, watching our animals suffer. The men would walk in the back door, I could see by the looks of their faces that something And they were just cruel and relentless. Every night, we'd hear this noise, and we could hear the sheep bleating. [David] Over three years, all but about 50 of nearly 2,000 of their lambs [Glenda] This is one night's damage. [Andrew] When a dog bites anything, They're full of contamination and they just... Within four or five days, It's a horrible, horrible, horrible death. [David] Look at that one... It's the guts ripped out and hanging down. They wouldn't last. You can imagine The pain. [David] You were saying earlier in this high country The men rarely ever in case they see a dog. One of my sons and the grandchildren It's only a matter of time. And they're getting gamer and gamer. [David] Andrew and Glenda when they decided to take one last shot at preserving their livelihood. Six years ago, they bought and raised them from pups Maremmas originated bred to protect flocks against wolves. With their floppy ears they don't scare the sheep. They identify the flock and they'll protect them even people they don't know. -[Andrew] Hello. is what's changed your whole operation Them is lifesavers, these blokes. The old bloke there... [David] Andrew says the attacks have stopped. The old bloke's... He's a bit of a loner. And off he goes. [David] He's checked you out, and he's going back to his sheep. [David] These guardian dogs Their sheep are safer, even with wild dogs Linda van Bommel is a researcher For the past two years, she's included in a study I caught up to her [David] Linda van Bommel, I presume. I thought I was never going to find you. I'll tell you what, you have the most beautiful office space -[Linda] It's good, isn't it? What you're trying to do here actually do their job. Yes, because, well, it's pretty obvious at protecting sheep or cattle But how do they do it? [David] Linda's using sound and scent to test the Maremmas' So we're going to set it up [David] The dingo's howl Linda wants to know She sets up the speaker, some remotely triggered cameras and a little dingo urine. [Linda] If you have a wild dog or a dingo you don't expect it because any dog, So I'm really interested in finding out [David] Linda programs a timer to set off the speaker The Maremmas are nearly a kilometer away, From the cover of the bush, [distant dingo howling] Oh my God, that's just instant. [David] Even at this distance, the Maremmas [dingo howling] They've zeroed right in on the source. If it was a real wild dog he'd be facing some stiff resistance. The Maremmas are big, much larger than any dingo or wild dog. The remote cameras show that wild dogs and so are the Maremmas. Linda says the sheep are safe, because the Maremmas And in the dog world, This is all starting Maybe guardian dogs are part of the solution But Maremmas can't protect stock There's just too much land. There's a place that's taken a whole different approach, where cattle and dingoes This remote cattle station an ecologist with James Cook University. With her is author and researcher They say this place is different, because for the last year, dingoes here have been left in peace. [Adam] Well, here we are in dingo utopia. What do you think of the dam? It is amazing how the water's [David] And the amount of vegetation What's especially surprising that herbivores love to eat. And Arian and Adam -[Arian] That's a mulga. Without the dingoes, It'd get munched off In all your travels, Dave, this environment around this dam? Man, I've got to be honest with you: Palatable vegetation like this I mean, the behavior of livestock is... It's easier if you get a feed and so when the cows come in, the calves, of course, and you're going to lose [Arian] Exactly, and water is also the center of the dingoes' lives. It's the center of their territories. It's where a lot of their hunting And so if dingoes are allowed to persist, you actually get the grazing moving out, because this is the most dangerous place So, in fact, the dingoes are actually As we see here. [David] Arian and Adam believe that dingoes can help I get how more vegetation would mean so they'd leave the cattle alone. But Arian and Adam [Arian] When dingoes are persecuted, their pack structure breaks down. Their pack structure is very important for the stability of their behavior. And where persecution happens, for the most part, that's where You basically get a situation young juvenile delinquents running amok, harassing calves. So it's like taking and then just leaving all the young people about how the best way or what's appropriate to eat Yeah. Well, we need our elders to teach us manners, to teach us rules And dingoes are exactly the same. [David] On this station, What I'm hearing is that they're And a top-order predator right down to the plants. But I have to ask, what about the cattle? [Arian] It's possible that dingoes But at the same time, you have a station that can feed, that can produce vegetation At the end of the day, to have the dingoes in the system. [David] It's a pretty compelling theory that dingoes Looking over this land, I've got a whole new view Today, Adam's taking me and everywhere I look, I see dingoes. These animals They don't know to be afraid. We think of dingoes But out here, I'm just seeing curiosity. I wonder if he'll come closer. [David] What I'm going to try to do is make really little weird noises, so the dog's going to try to check me out and hopefully get a bit closer. This is absolutely incredible. We're on thousands and thousands and to be able to be this close... It's unbelievable. [David] This young dingo He's trying to make sense of what I am and where I fit in his world. And I'm trying to understand The way I think about dingoes I've lost some fear I know why many farmers But now I see how intimately tied Are we missing something in not getting that Australia And it doesn't matter what we do, dogs will slip through the cracks and create their own niche And maybe there's a different solution Some farmers Others may be able to use guardian dogs. And for still others, maybe leaving the dingo alone will impose As a species, It seems we might need them One thing I do know: I can't imagine Australia without them. For the first time in my life, I'm making camp in the bush, and I'm actually glad [dingo howling]
