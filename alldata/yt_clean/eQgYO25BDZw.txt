But Jong Min has one thing... - that the rest of you... don't have. - What is that? - Innocence? - He's never been married. - Hey, a divorce... People don't care about that these days. - Being divorced isn't a crime. Will Jong Min pick you or me? - Let's exclude Won Hee. Jong Min has worked with me... in the music industry for a long time.

If I was there... Jong Kook, what's your plan Do you have any plans - Me? Actually... - You don't have anything. (Are you done with my blind date?) Is it over like this? - Yes. It doesn't mean anything. - just like this? When we went hiking, - we had good TV ratings. It'd be nice to climb (Go hiking?) - He wants to go hiking again. &quot;Three famous mountains&quot;.

But I always tell this to people... - who are already at the top. - People who reached the peak. People who are enjoying... their popularity and stuff. - You can climb up somehow. But what happens when you go up? - You must come down. (When you climb up, you must come down.) (Astonished) - When you go up Mount Halla, unless you freeze to death, you must climb down. - What a great saying. Jae Hoon said another great line. &quot;Mount Halla isn't for hiking. - Yes. - Why do you laugh? Choose 21 or 17 degrees. (That's right!) - There's no choice if you climb up. - You must climb down. So it's perfect. - He's good at stretching. - He's good at stretching. - It's stretching. Hey, we can't show the logo! It looks just like that logo. No. We can't show that. - Jjingko, come here.

Don't schedule any work in April. - No. Hello? Let's say you are in that situation. Yes. Which one of them would you introduce... to your friend? - I'd pick Jae Hoon. - Because he's pleasant and funny. - He livens up the mood. Do you know anyone as old as Jae Hoon? No. Whose friend do you want to be... introduced to? Well, - Hee Chul? Yes. - He knows who is good. - Even I know that. - I thought of Hee Chul too. Earlier, Si Won said, There are lines... that make people feel good. - Do you say something like that? I don't say something like that. I tell people honestly. - I just tell her that I like her. Some women like men - But some find it uncomfortable. As soon as you meet someone? No, not as soon as I meet her. After a while... Like two hours later? - Some people... &quot;But I like you.&quot; Some people like those who are aggressive. At first, I tell her that she's pretty. - I say that a lot. You said you were shy. - He's shy around men only. (He's shy around men only.) (On the road to Gyeongju) Gyeongju? It's Sang Min. (Lonely Sang Min is driving.) - What? The weather's always nice Yes.

We'll live a happy life. Why am I so embarrassed? (His heart is fluttering.) Look. (She's embarrassed too.) - Let's sit down. - Sit down. - Yeong, please sit down. - Goodness. This is different from what I got. All right. Gosh, when did you prepare all this? Goodness. It's not much. (This is definitely a lot.) (They're homemade braised short ribs.) (Octopus, jeon, and japchae) (This feast is - Goodness. They must be great cooks. I agree. What a feast. Gosh, they prepared so much. We heard you liked braised short ribs. What? Who told you that? - It must've been him. - I never told you. - Goodness. - Thank you. braised short ribs (Eat up, Yeong.) We forgot the chojang. - Right. Let me help. - No. - I feel bad about doing nothing. - Sit down. - You should sit down too. - Sit down. Sit down. I'll do it. - Sit down. - You're very tall and pretty. You're too kind. (She's shy.) Do we not have rice? - We do. - No. (They all get up.) - Stay seated. - Stay here. What a scene. (They all get up.) (It's okay.) - We should help out. - It's okay. Sit down. We don't need rice on top of this feast. She's in charge of that. But still... - Sit down. It feels weird (They're restless.) I feel bad about sitting It's really okay. - Is there anything we can do? - Sit down. I'll go. Eat up. I'll be back soon. - Sit down. (She's restless.) Sit down. In that situation, she should just be at ease Eating well is the best. What is this? - Isn't this sumac chicken? Don't let her eat this - What? She's allergic to sumac, - but she's still preparing this. - She's... (Despite her allergy, - Gosh. That's sumac chicken. We didn't know what you'd like, - I love them all. There aren't any dishes I dislike. But I especially like these dishes. - Eat up. We prepared a lot. (She's relieved.) (He feels like an outsider.) I thought she was a fan of his. - Yes. He's not that interesting to her anymore. (She's more interested - Let me. - I should help. Let me. I'll help. It's okay. (Sang Min is awkward.) - Goodness. Make yourselves at home. - Sit down. - Your hands should be unscathed. - Don't hurt them. He's worried about her hands. Unbelievable. (She's envious.) - Let me do it. - It's okay. - It's not hot. - I'll do it. Just sit down. (I'll do it! Just sit down, both of you!) (He feels awkward.) Just sit down. It must be so awkward. He should just sit down. There's too much food. (He doesn't know whether to sit or stand.) - Sit down. (It's finally time to eat.) - There's not much, but eat up. Thank you for the meal. - Eat up. - Thank you for the meal. Do you want some other soup? Sorry? No, it's okay. - Thank you for the meal. Thank you for the meal. - I hope you like it. (This sumac chicken soup Gosh. (She's happy.) It's really good. Please eat, ma'am. It's really good. (She's eating well.) Gosh, she's pretty even when she's eating. (Someone who eats well is the best.) Have your favorite, braised short ribs. Thank you. It must've been tough to make this. (She's so thoughtful.) Give me the bellflower roots. It's really good. Have some bellflower roots. We bought and prepared... - the roots ourselves. We did it ourselves. (Savoring) It's really good. - Have some of this too. How did you know she liked japchae? She loves japchae. Japchae is a must-have dish. (Sang Min eats quietly (Last year, when he was here...) (Sang Min, have some of this.) (Have some of this.) (Eat up. We have a lot.) (Have some of this. I made it.) (They were very considerate of him.) (He had a great time back then.) They used to be... head over heels for him. They were his biggest fans. But now, no one is interested in him. - Their future niece-in-law came. - They should show less affection. Their future niece-in-law is there. I don't think it's because of Yeong. I think they just lost interest. (He feels lonely.) - Have some of this too. I made some for this spring. (He's pretty much invisible.) They erased him. It's so hilarious. Her japchae is really good. Try it. They're all delicious. (Her japchae is tasty, you say?) (He slurps on some japchae.) (It is good.) The lotus roots are good too. (The lotus roots, you say?) We made this japchae. It's good. (It's tasty.) The lotus roots are really good. Had you not said it out loud, (Right, there's Sang Min.) They're really delicious. Eat up. - Eat up. (I'm eating a lot.) I was worried about you... - because you have a cast on. Is this meat jeon? - Beef pancakes. Joon Woo. Stop doing that next to Sang Min. I can eat on my own. I can eat on my own. - Take care of him. - Let me try it first. Thanks. I should've made something better. Everything I like is here. His aunts... - You should eat. This is good. Try it. - I will eat. I feel full to see her. She's so pretty. (Shy) Since when were you so pretty? - Pardon? Since she was born. - Right. Joon Woo... Joon Woo was very cute since he was young. He was good-looking since he was born. You say that because he's our nephew. No. He was very cute when he was young. Her legs are as long as my height. I was surprised when you walked in. You're very tall. And you have a very small face. She looks like a doll. - Yes. We watch your videos... on YouTube every day. I looked it up too. If you keep doing that, she can't eat. She can't eat. (It's because we're so happy.) - You should eat. Of course. By the way, (Curious) He was different from others. In my point of view. He's sincere. And serious. I thought he was different. I... wanted to protect him. And I knew he could protect me too. That's how I felt. I lived with him the longest Despite the environment, he turned out really well. I'm... still surprised. It's hard to find a man like him. Yes. (Slurping) - Compared to my environment? I'm pretty bright. Yes. You didn't go astray. Sang Min should eat at the table. Separately. He can enjoy the food there. There are many side dishes. He should eat at a separate table. It won't be easy to eat there. Not only compared to the environment he's just an upright person. Yes. I'm positive. Joon Woo has many strengths. He can cook. - He's a good cook. He's respectful. He's considerate. That's enough. He's also very strong. (She keeps boasting about Joon Woo Joon Woo isn't picky about food. If you eat well, it brings you luck. And he eats everything well. (Sang Min is also eating well.) He cooks what he wants to eat. - He's sincere and considerate. - He's respectful. - Sang Min. It's fine. (Sang Min suddenly gets up.) - It's fine. I'll have some more soup. He wants more soup. My goodness. - You should go. It's okay. Stay seated. I'm here to get some soup. But... (Your aunt's food is so good.) I'll heat it up for you. It's okay. - I... - You should've asked me. - You're still not well. the cast yesterday. It still hurts. When I'm injured, - this chicken soup helps. It's helping me today. We made it to help you get better. (Eat a lot, Sang Min!) That's how we made it. (Exclaiming) (Sang Min's eating a lot.) Joon Woo. What's that in your hand? - This? Our wedding band. - This? - Isn't it nice? Yes. It's our wedding band. It's... (Joon Woo. You must be happy.) - It's a wedding band. get her something nicer. But I can't afford it. Even though I gave it to her she was happy with it. I said I'll get her something nicer... - when I make lots of money. People get something practical these days. And it's nice. I like it. - Isn't it nice? Your heart is as pretty as you look. That's why I like her. She's frugal. (The more they find out about her, But the couple's ring is... It's the same as the wedding band. Isn't that for boyfriends and girlfriends? - No. - Sang Min. You have a ring too. Sang Min. You have a ring too. (Sang Min's wearing a ring?) (Could it be...) It's just an accessory. It doesn't mean anything. It's only an accessory. (It's just an accessory.) Sang Min. Just drink some more chicken soup. Why do you keep interrupting (I see.) You should get a wedding band soon. (Laughing) Sang Min. You turned 50 this year. Even Joon Woo is getting married. I should. I didn't think the youngest would I know. Since the youngest got off the other guys will meet someone nice... and have good news soon. (I hope that happens one day.) He's eating a lot. He's drinking from the bowl. (The soup tastes good.) - I think I'm lucky. I could never find a wife like her But you're kind too. Only if I was a little taller. But... Why? What's wrong with your height? What's wrong with your height? I'm too short. She doesn't like you for your height. I always... (On eggshells) (Getting up) - Let me get it. Stay seated. I'll get it on my own. You're still a guest. It's okay. Is he doing that to get attention? Maybe he was hungry. - He should... He should just bring the whole pot. You should take care of Sang Min. There's no more soup. (I'll get food on my own.) Here. (Emptying) I'm suddenly getting heated up. It's really good for you. I'm sorry, but can you pretend you don't see me Still, you're a guest. But... You should take care of Sang Min. I'm eating a lot. I'm really enjoying it. I'm able to enjoy it... because you're not talking to me. (It's his third bowl.) We stopped by at his mother's grave And she got her a nice pair of shoes. (How nice of her.) It must've been a long way from Seoul. You still visited her grave? It wasn't that far. She prepared so much. I didn't know. Mom liked red. - Mom liked red. Something bright. I told her briefly... about it before, and she remembered it. She got the red shoes... and framed the picture of us. And we put those by her grave... so she could see us through the picture. - Also, she prepared eels. She prepared a lot. (She must've gone through a lot Your mom must've been the happiest today. - I bet she loved it. She must've loved to see you both... - if she was with us, right? - Why are you suddenly crying? (She'd have loved to see her son and She always cries whenever Why would you cry on such a good day? Whenever I see the places... I've been with her on TV, it makes me cry. That happens to me too. (They're reminded of their sister If the person who did you'd feel their absence gravely. So I bet it's worse for Joon Woo. As long as you live happily, - we'd have nothing to worry about. - I'll do my best. (We'll live happily.) (We hope they'll be happy.) Sang Min, you should get married soon too. - Right. My goodness. She came to him like destiny. - Seeing them... I bet you'll live happily - Of course. - He's doing really well too. - I'll get some water. - You should get it for him. - No, it's okay. I got this. (Let me be alone for a while.) (Actually, I have something to share.) (Joon Ho suddenly sounds serious.) (I got a girlfriend.) (Surprise revealing of his new girlfriend) (Are you still drunk?) (It's well past April Fool's Day.) (What nonsense is he saying?) (Why don't they believe me?) (It was before the article was released,) (so they can't believe him.) (His new girlfriend is Ji Min.) (You're seeing Ji Min?) You mean Kim Ji Min? (It is my girlfriend's number.) - The number you dialed... (The number you dialed is not available.) (He's mentally ill. Is he sick?) (What's wrong with you?) (This is driving me crazy!) (Right then, Ji Min calls him back.) (Hey, Ji Min.) (Yes?) (I'm dating you, right?) (Isn't he practically begging her?) (Ji Min.) (Are you really seeing Joon Ho?) (Well, that's...) (If you're being blackmailed, (Can we trust his words (It's still...) (Wait. Really?) (My Little Old Boy)
