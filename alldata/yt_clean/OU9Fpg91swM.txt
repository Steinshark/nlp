- [Link] Every Halloween, - [Link] they come out with all these candies and treats and whatnots - [Link] and how are you supposed to know what you're supposed to eat - [Link] that you can really enjoy? - [Rhett] Only one way. - [Rhett] First, we're going to check our voicemail. - [Becca] Hi, Rhett and Link, it's Becca from Cleveland, Ohio. - [Becca] Bringing you a daily shark fact. Did you know that sharks - [Becca] will never know the feeling of being tucked tightly into bed - [Becca] like a little burrito? Thanks. - [Link] Well, that's depressing. If I cared about sharks. - [Rhett] Already knew that because of Shark Week - [Link] Soulless eyes. Gwynedd get in here. - [Rhett] Sharks got to wear two cups, by the way. - [Link] Yeah, yeah. Because they got two weenies? - [Gwynedd] Sharks have two weenies? - [Rhett] Yeah, sharks got two weenies. - [Gwynedd] I did not know that. - [Rhett] They can lose one. - [Gwynedd] Really? - [Rhett] When they're playing baseball. - [Gwynedd] How are they losing them? - [Rhett] Baseball. Shark baseball is a big trend, right now. - [Link] Happy Friday the 13th. - [Gwynedd] Yeah. - [Link] Tis the season to taste these snacks. - [Link] The other way to know which ones to eat is to go to Sporked. - [Link] Where Gwynedd works. And they will tell you what to do as well. - [Link] In terms of buying and consuming of the Halloween snacks. - [Rhett] And throughout the, sorry Gwynedd, go ahead. - [Rhett] I have something I'm going to say, but you say what you're going to say first. - [Gwynedd] I was just going to make like a weenie joke because I was going to say, - [Gwynedd] it's about to get Halloweenie in here. - [Rhett] Oh, shoot. How many Halloweenies are there? - [Rhett] There's only one Halloweenie a year. - [Link] Frankenweenie was a Tim Burton movie, right? - [Link] You know what? I'm going to watch that one. - [Rhett] It's about time you got around to that. - [Link] Yeah, because I've seen, last year, I watched The Corpse Bride. - [Gwynedd] Did you like it? - [Link] I did. - [Rhett] It wasn't too scary for you? - [Link] And it was the artistry. - [Rhett] The artistry is really compelling. - [Link] I'm an artist. - [Rhett] Really compelling. - [Link] I feel like that's my contribution. - [Rhett] I have a can of worms that I will be opening up throughout as well. - [Rhett] Can I just start because there's a whole, I mean, there's a lot of worms. - [Gwynedd] Okay. - [Rhett] Look at this worm that's got words. - [Rhett] Link had to have surgery to enlarge the dimples in his butt. - [Gwynedd] Nice. - [Rhett] Well, this has been revealed. - [Link] They did it with a spoon. - [Gwynedd] But worth it, right? - [Link] Totally worth it. Yeah. - [Rhett] What do they do with the extra meat they took out? - [Link] It's in my cheeks. Went from cheek to cheek. - [Link] All right, kick his off, Gwynedd. - [Gwynedd] Okay, well, we were going to start actually. - [Gwynedd] Oh, do we want to start with? - [Rhett] We want to start with whatever you want to start with. - [Gwynedd] I was going to try to play by the rules this time - [Gwynedd] and this says that we are starting with Fanta Mystery Flavor. - [Link] Zero sugar? - [Gwynedd] Yeah, zero sug. So soda companies have gotten ((Laughing)) - [Gwynedd] have gotten more into doing mystery flavored things. - [Link] This is fun. And Is it the same every bottle or? - [Gwynedd] Yes. - [Rhett] Do you know why they're doing that, though? - [Gwynedd] I think because people like mystery flavored things? - [Rhett] It's the rise of nihilism. - [Gwynedd] Oh, okay. I feel like I'm into that. Cheers. - [Rhett] The youth, they got nothing to live for. - [Rhett] They think that life is pointless and purposeless. - [Rhett] And so you have to give them things - [Rhett] to make their their days seem somewhat meaningful. - [Rhett] And so they say things like, oh, if I can get this Fanta - [Rhett] and figure out what flavor it is, maybe I can add meaning to my day, Fanta. - [Rhett] Thank you, Fanta. - [Rhett] So the corporations are basically are the only way that the youth - [Rhett] can have meaning now, basically because of neoliberalism. - [Rhett] And just the way that the state is empowering - [Rhett] the expansion of a capitalist mindset. - [Rhett] It's kind of spreading and infecting the entire world. - [Rhett] And so in the midst of this, where kids have absolutely no hope - [Rhett] and a lot of the traditional structures that added some sort of - [Rhett] systematic approach to their lives have been torn down - [Rhett] through movements like spiritual deconstruction here in the United States, - [Rhett] which I'm, you know, a participant in. - [Rhett] Now, they're looking for ways to find meaning. - [Rhett] And what I'm telling you, youth, is that you can find meaning in Fanta. - [Gwynedd] That's exactly what I was going to say. What do you think? - [Link] Do you wear that dress every Halloween? - [Gwynedd] Yes, it's my Halloween costume. - [Link] So I like it. - [Rhett] What are you supposed to be? - [Gwynedd] A funky art teacher - [Rhett] Now, what is that? Let's find some meaning in this. - [Link] This is caffeine free. It's also sugar free. It's, - [Link] I guess, all Fanta is caffeine free? - [Stevie] What does it taste like? - [Link] Like they mixed all of the Fanta flavors that no one bought together. - [Stevie] Okay, so, like, fruity? - [Rhett] Is that a hint? - [Gwynedd] It turns your tongue black. - [Link] A little bit. - [Stevie] Isn't it weird how I was thinking, like, if someone had this on their desk, - [Stevie] like, if someone was drinking this in real life, you'd be like, that's a choice. - [Stevie] But a Coke or like a cola is a dark brown already. - [Stevie] But there's something from the leap - [Stevie] from dark brown to black that makes it - [Rhett] Well, and the even better part of that would be is if you were like, - [Rhett] what are you drinking? And they were like, I don't know. - [Rhett] I haven't figured it out. That's what I'm doing today to find meaning. - [Link] It tastes like novelty. That's really all that matters. I don't like it. - [Rhett] It's not great. - [Link] But I like the experience. I just don't like the taste. - [Rhett] I have no idea what flavor this is. - [Link] You have a guess? It smells grape ish. - [Gwynedd] I looked on the internet and people are guessing black berry, - [Gwynedd] but I think that could be by virtue of the color. - [Link] I really think, they're scraping together the offings from the production. - [Rhett] It was a surplus. - [Link] It's a business. This is a business ploy. - [Rhett] It was a surplus. - [Link] And you know what? - [Rhett] So you don't know what it is? - [Gwynedd] I don't, no. They won't tell. - [Link] I will stand by that. - [Gwynedd] They will never tell. - [Link] We're going to rank these. That's low, right? - [Link] But the experience is pretty high. - [Rhett] Oh, it's zero sugar? - [Link] What do you want to go with? - [Link] Okay. - [Rhett] I was talking about systems, okay? - [Rhett] When that was clearly explained. - [Link] Where you want to go next? - [Stevie] I mean, there is a zero sug. Like Gwynedd went with a sug. - [Rhett] I was thinking about what I was going to say, Stevie. - [Stevie] And then Link was like, well, let me tell you, it is sugar free. - [Link] Right, I didn't hear Gwynedd, Rhett didn't hear Gwynedd. - [Link] And then, Rhett didn't hear me or Gwynedd. - [Link] But I did hear me. - [Link] They should call this Suge Knight though. - [Link] That would be a good name for this. - [Link] Get him in the commercial. - [Link] He can dangle Vanilla Ice over a balcony. - [Gwynedd] Yeah. The best Suge Knight story of all time. - [Link] He can run over people. - [Rhett] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - [Rhett] We don't know if that was him. - [Gwynedd] Uh oh. Oh, no. - [Gwynedd] Not the enemy we want to make. - [Link] If he gets out of prison and comes for me. - [Link] That would be not worth your time, Suge. - [Link] Not worth your time, Sugar. - [Link] What you want? What you want to do next? - [Gwynedd] Okay, how about Brach's Fall Festival Candy Corn. - [Gwynedd] Can we have the bag? - [Gwynedd] Yeah, because there's different flavors - [Gwynedd] and we want to know what they are. - [Rhett] Oh, this. Is really exciting, Gwynedd. - [Rhett] I'm listening to everything that you're saying. - [Rhett] You said it was Brach's Fall. - [Gwynedd] Fall Festival Candy Corn. - [Link] Interesting. So we've got. - [Gwynedd] It's upside down on this side, I hate that. - [Link] So this is like a red and a brown. - [Rhett] Now, do you think that this is an answer to people - [Rhett] who don't celebrate Halloween - [Rhett] and they celebrate the Fall Festival, because that's what we did. - [Gwynedd] Oh, really? Cause Halloween's satanic? - [Rhett] Pre Elementary, we didn't have a Halloween party. - [Rhett] We had a Fall Festival. - [Rhett] So, I couldn't take any of this candy. - [Link] I didn't love the brown and red one. - [Link] Let me go with the one that just looks like normal candy corn. - [Gwynedd] Yeah, it's weird. - [Gwynedd] So the brown and red one is actually a caramel apple. - [Gwynedd] It's very weird. - [Rhett] Oh, man. - [Link] What's the yellow? This one is citrusy. - [Rhett] Don't do the Lemon Lime Snow Cone - [Gwynedd] I don't, some of these don't seem like very fall like flavors. - [Rhett] You got a Lemonade Shake Up in your hand there, Link. - [Link] It's not bad. It's very lemony. - [Rhett] Oh, and of course, a Cotton Candy. That might be good. - [Gwynedd] I wish that they were more Fall like, - [Gwynedd] it's like lemon this and lime that and strawberry this. - [Gwynedd] And just like, I don't know - [Link] What's the green and cream? - [Rhett] Lemon Lime Snow Cone. Kettle Corn, is slippery. - [Rhett] This one seems like the one that's going to be good. - [Link] Lemon Lime Snow Cone is too harsh. - [Gwynedd] Whoa, it's crazy. Candy corn that tastes like corn. How clever. - [Rhett] It's real strong. Be ready. - [Link] Oh, wow. Very buttery. - [Rhett] That's one I'm picking out of there. - [Link] I mean, it tasted just like the - [Rhett] Real candy corn? - [Link] Popcorn jelly bean. - [Rhett] It does taste just like the popcorn jelly bean. - [Gwynedd] It does. I'm tasting Cotton Candy now. - [Rhett] I don't know about these, man. - [Rhett] I think candy corn is better than every flavor that I tasted. - [Rhett] Just regular candy corn. And candy corn is not even good. - [Link] I think this is good. If you're a lonely child. - [Rhett] Maybe this will help. - [Gwynedd] That's so true. - [Link] Which I was growing up. - [Rhett] Link drops his ice cream cones on the ground on purpose - [Rhett] so he can get free ones. - [Rhett] And then he licks the first one off the sidewalk. - [Link] You had me till the last part. - [Rhett] Yeah. You had a little system to double up on your ice cream, huh? - [Link] Yeah. Get an extra scoop. - [Gwynedd] I felt like I didn't totally understand it, but that's okay. - [Rhett] Yeah. Yeah. - [Rhett] It's fine. Hey, listen, you don't have to listen me either. - [Link] You know, it's a good ice cream shop if you order a scoop - [Link] and they give you two scoops, and they say - [Link] that's really our scoop. - [Link] You know, it's like, that's a good spot - [Rhett] And when they whisper it like that too. - [Link] And when they whisper to you - [Rhett] That's really our scoop. - [Link] I mean, it is good, right? - [Rhett] It's not just for you, it's for everyone. - [Gwynedd] You're not getting a deal here. - [Rhett] I don't know why I'm whispering. - [Link] Those are the best ice cream shops and free samples - [Link] and the ones that take cards. - [Gwynedd] Yeah. - [Rhett] Cash only ice cream, eh. - [Gwynedd] Boo! Okay. - [Rhett] We're also ranking them. - [Gwynedd] I know. If we're going to pick like - [Gwynedd] the most Halloweenie snack. - [Gwynedd] I feel like this doesn't make the cut. I don't think. - [Rhett] This is the best side. Right? - [Rhett] Because it's like one, to, so they're both bad. - [Gwynedd] Yeah. All right. - [Link] I like this better. I think the experience is better, but the taste is - [Gwynedd] How about Apple Harvest Sour Patch Kids? - [Rhett] Okay, now, we might be getting somewhere. - [Rhett] I mean, apple. We know the apple flavored stuff is great. Sour Patch Kids. - [Link] So we've got green ones. We've got red ones. We've got what? - [Gwynedd] They're not kids. - [Rhett] No, the kids are harvesting the apples. - [Rhett] The kids put them in buckets, - [Rhett] which is not really a child labor thing - [Rhett] because they're Sour Patch Kids. They're not actual kids. - [Gwynedd] What are they? - [Rhett] Well, but thanks to, sort of. - [Rhett] They're like gingerbread kids. - [Rhett] But thanks to the way - [Rhett] the capitalist system that we have here in America - [Rhett] has sort of infiltrated the world, - [Rhett] it actually forces kids into labor in other countries - [Rhett] to provide manufacturing and industrial services for us - [Rhett] that we used to do in this country. - [Link] Well, these are good. - [Gwynedd] I love them. - [Link] What do we think? - [Link] Apple is, like, one of my favorite candy flavors. - [Link] And, the fact, they have three different types of apple candy. - [Link] That's pretty awesome. - [Gwynedd] I didn't realize it was going to be like that. - [Gwynedd] It was Cranberry Apple, Apple Cider, and Caramel Apple. - [Gwynedd] And I think they're all delicious. - [Link] They really are. This is stellar. - [Rhett] Man. That's good. Not too sour. - [Gwynedd] Not too sour. - [Link] Let's put that in the number one spot way over here. - [Link] What's next? - [Gwynedd] Um, Mountain Dew Voodoo. - [Rhett] Okay, I'm not participating. - [Link] Mountain Voodoo - [Rhett] I have to maintain this bit - [Rhett] that I'm very mad about all the new things that Mountain Dew comes up with. - [Rhett] When in actuality, I don't care. - [Gwynedd] It's a mystery flavor. - [Rhett] Okay. I'm in - [Gwynedd] Nihilism. - [Rhett] Yeah, let me see if I can find my purpose today. - [Link] Let's see if you can give the same speech again. - [Rhett] I probably can't. - [Link] All right, dink it. - [Link] Triple dink it. - [Link] Triple sink it. - [Rhett] But hold on, you put Never Wet on that dress? - [Rhett] Because it bounced right off. - [Link] She's an art teacher. - [Gwynedd] I do that to all my clothes. - [Rhett] Is that a rubber dress? - [Rhett] Because it literally, I can't find it anymore. - [Rhett] It just hit and bounced off. - [Rhett] She's wearing a rubber dress. - [Gwynedd] I did. - [Rhett] That art teacher's got a rubber dress. Can't stain her. - [Rhett] you can't stain her no matter how hard you try. - [Gwynedd] I won't be stained. - [Rhett] Wow, that's bad. - [Link] Not sugar free. This is sugared. - [Gwynedd] That's very sugared. - [Rhett] Tastes like a rotten melon. - [Link] It's so interesting that they like. - [Link] They devoted so much space to encouraging you to recycle it. - [Link] That's so interesting. - [Rhett] Well, don't get me started on that - [Link] Refresh then recycle. So interesting. - [Rhett] You know what we do when you put things in the recycling can? - [Link] Send it to China. - [Rhett] We ship it to other countries and they just put it in the rivers. - [Gwynedd] Yeah. - [Gwynedd] This is all pretty depressing. - [Rhett] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Rhett] There's nothing to live for anymore. - [Link] It's the season for that, though. Darkness and - [Rhett] That's right. Yeah, that's why I'm doing this. - [Rhett] It's like a little horror short that I'm doing in my own personal mind. - [Link] Stevie, this is. It does have a berry-ness to it, but it also. - [Rhett] Stevie doesn't know either, though. - [Link] She always wants to know what stuff actually tastes like. - [Stevie] It's good. - [Stevie] I honestly, of all the things that could have been said - [Stevie] after Link says my name that - [Stevie] That really was the best. - [Rhett] Good point. - [Gwynedd] So, the Internet has an idea of what this flavor is, - [Gwynedd] and do you want to guess it? - [Link] It's lemon berry? Lime. Lime berry. - [Gwynedd] It could be. - [Rhett] Um, what's that stuff you put into your dishwasher? - [Rhett] Rinse aid? - [Link] Lychee. - [Rhett] I'm going to go with Rinse aid. - [Gwynedd] Okay. - [Rhett] Yeah, that's my flavor of choice. - [Link] What do they say? - [Gwynedd] White mystery flavored Airheads. - [Rhett] Oh, it's tasting like the mystery Airhead, which is also a mystery. - [Rhett] Which we already know - [Rhett] is a combination of all the offage from Airheads, - [Rhett] because we've learned that on this show. - [Gwynedd] and that's what I was going to say. - [Gwynedd] So it could be berry and lemon and lime. - [Rhett] So, by extension, this is just a combo of a bunch of flavors. - [Rhett] And you know what? - [Rhett] White is a combination of all the colors. - [Link] Exactly accurate. - [Link] Art teacher? You know that? - [Gwynedd] I do, yes. I have a color wheel on my classroom wall. - [Link] Comment and agree. - [Gwynedd] So where does this one go? - [Link] I think it's it's a lot better than this one. - [Rhett] It's not better than Sour Patch Kids. - [Gwynedd] No - [Link] No, no, no, no, no. - [Rhett] They're special. - [Link] But it's second. - [Gwynedd] Okay, next we're trying Stuffed Puffs Monster Mash Marshmallows. - [Gwynedd] Sorry, I have the burps a little bit from all this soda. - [Rhett] Holy moly, look at those, now can you bring out the actual packaging? - [Rhett] Because this is fascinating. - [Rhett] They had to make a choice to individually package - [Rhett] the marshmallows inside of the package. - [Rhett] To keep the sprinklers, sprinklers? From coming off. - [Link] Yeah. I don't have to open it to prove that. - [Gwynedd] I think they're intended to be Halloween treats for Trick or Treaters, yeah. - [Rhett] Yes. - [Stevie] Rhett, you're being very stingy with the worms. I'm assuming. - [Rhett] I thought you were going to say you're being very factual and informative today. - [Rhett] And I was gonna be like, well, yeah. - [Rhett] On weekends, Link masquerades as a child. - [Link] Oh, I didn't know what you were gonna say. ((Laughing)) - [Link] Only on the weekends - [Link] If I can just get to Saturday or Friday night really. - [Link] My weekends begin at - [Rhett] Sundown, just like the Sabbath. - [Rhett] On weekends, Link masquerades as a child - [Rhett] who participates in ten and under tee ball tournaments. - [Link] What does your husband say about this show? - [Link] Like, does he watch any of your appearances? - [Gwynedd] Yeah, of course. - [Link] He's a rock star of sorts. - [Link] I mean, well, I just insulted him. - [Link] Because I know he's not watching. Right? - [Rhett] What's your pet name for your husband? - [Rhett] What do you call him? Baby? Honey? Sweetie? - [Gwynedd] A pet name for? I don't think we do that. - [Rhett] You just call him by his first name? - [Gwynedd] Yeah. - [Rhett] Okay, what's his first name? - [Gwynedd] Tim. - [Rhett] Tim. - [Gwynedd] I call him Timmy some times. - [Rhett] Hey, Timmy. - [Link] Mr. Tim. - [Rhett] Thanks for tuning in. - [Rhett] I'm assuming these are the only parts - [Rhett] of what we do here at Mythical that you watch. - [Link] Why doesn't he come to any of the parties, like Mythical parties? - [Gwynedd] Has he ever been invited? - [Gwynedd] Those are only for like, real rock stars. - [Link] We can't afford plus ones. - [Rhett] We've only had one holiday party since COVID. - [Link] Since you've worked here. - [Link] Well yeah, sometimes we let the partners come, - [Link] if they want to, but then they usually don't want to. - [Link] Does he watch? Does he watch your appearances? - [Gwynedd] Yeah, he does. - [Rhett] Timmy is watching this right now. - [Rhett] He's been watching the whole time. - [Rhett] We've been talking about him. - [Link] And what does he say about it? Like, what's his assessment? - [Link] You know, until you find the next thing. - [Gwynedd] It's his, what? - [Link] It's like just - [Gwynedd] He said it's his favorite show. - [Rhett] Yeah. - [Gwynedd] Not "nice"? - [Rhett] Yeah, I knew that. - [Gwynedd] I had a bite that was no chocolate, just marshmallow. - [Rhett] You got to get to the chocolate. - [Rhett] And when you do get the chocolate, - [Rhett] it's just like those other ones we have, that are great - [Gwynedd] I know. I don't like the sprinkles, though. It's too much. - [Link] Are the sprinkles chocolate? What? - [Gwynedd] No, there's chocolate inside of your marshmallow. - [Rhett] You have to get to it. - [Gwynedd] I know. It's like smaller. - [Link] Oh, look at that. - [Rhett] I think if you're a marshmallow fan and you don't mind sprinkles, - [Rhett] which I'm basically indifferent to sprinkles. - [Rhett] I think this gives a little bit of a textural thing. - [Rhett] I think he might be into these. - [Link] This might be the best marshmallow experience I've ever had. - [Link] I like the feel. I wouldn't call this a sprinkle. - [Link] Honestly, it's something, - [Link] it's a very icing-esque, big sprinkle, - [Link] and it feels really good to - [Link] put it in your mouth. - [Rhett] I think you mean, you know what? - [Rhett] You can call them whatever you want, because I don't think it really matters. - [Rhett] But these are sprinkles. - [Rhett] Like if you go to the yogurt shop and you see that shape, - [Rhett] they will call them sprinkles - [Rhett] and they call them sprinkles on the packaging. - [Link] We got this, I'm going to put that after, - [Link] point taken. I just, I do love them - [Rhett] it's not as good as, I agree. - [Rhett] It's not as good as Sour Patch Kids, it's a good second place, though. - [Gwynedd] I'm glad you guys like it. - [Rhett] I've got a little secret about, Link. - [Link] Make it quick. We're running out of time - [Link] and I want to spend all of it eating these. - [Rhett] Link Neal, in quotes, - [Rhett] Link Neal was a 45 year old long experiment carried out - [Rhett] by the Harvard Research Lab and will soon be retired. - [Rhett] It is considered a massive waste of money. - [Link] Taxpayers caught wind. - [Rhett] The experiment is about to be over. - [Gwynedd] Okay, I have to say that - [Gwynedd] I thought these were going to be actually skeleton shaped and they're not. - [Rhett] But why are there multiples? - [Link] Looks like a tombstone. - [Rhett] They're all the same just different wrapping? - [Gwynedd] And they're really kind of, - [Gwynedd] so this is like a new alternative to the pumpkins, - [Gwynedd] the Reese's Pumpkins that come out. - [Rhett] Smaller for sure. - [Rhett] Nice little graphic. - [Link] The ratio is so important, the pumpkins are so big and the peanut butter, - [Link] I love the peanut butter, but it's not enough. The ratios off. - [Link] This is the perfect ratio. - [Link] That right there is year roundable. - [Rhett] That's pretty good. I like both ratios. - [Rhett] I think that the pumpkin is so much peanut butter that I just absolutely love it. - [Rhett] But I feel like it's way too much food to eat in one sitting, - [Rhett] way too much candy to eat in one sitting. This, you got to pace it out. - [Link] It's basically the same as one of the minis or whatever they're called, the small. - [Link] You know, there's so many names. - [Rhett] So clearly this is the best tasting of all of these. - [Rhett] But I just don't want to just do the knee jerk thing - [Rhett] and put Reese's at the top, - [Rhett] because I feel like Reese's has so many other things - [Rhett] that you can experience, you know? - [Link] There's no surprises besides the ratio. I'm proposing this ranking, - [Link] because the marshmallows really brought me over. - [Link] They opened up a new world. - [Rhett] The dark side. - [Gwynedd] Amazing. - [Matt] Can we see what else is in that can of worms before we go. - [Gwynedd] Important. - [Link] They worked so hard on lying about me. - [Rhett] Link refuses to sign his kids field trip permission slips - [Rhett] because he thinks their teachers are just trying to get free autographs. ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] Link was once the front man of a band called Dr. Ball Bag. - [Link] Your husband was also in that band. - [Gwynedd] Absolutely. What kind of music is it? - [Link] Ambient. - [Rhett] Ballroom. - [Rhett] Christy has to play Link a video every morning when he wakes up, - [Rhett] so he remembers who he is. ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] That's just sad. - [Link] It's a Memento type thing. - [Rhett] Link practices arching his back in the mirror every night before bed. - [Gwynedd] That one's just true, right? - [Link] They're getting truer. - [Gwynedd] Based on your reaction. - [Rhett] Oh, also, remember, while we've got Gwynedd here. - [Rhett] Timmy, this one's for you. ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] Sporked has found the best spooky snacks for Halloween that are not candy. - [Rhett] So, Timmy, go over to Sporked.com - [Rhett] and see the full list for your wife.
