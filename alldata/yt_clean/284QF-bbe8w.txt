Can Consciousness Be Seen? 15 October 2024 [Questioner 1] Hi, Babaji. [Q.1] It felt very important that I take the mic, somehow. [Q.1] And ... [Q.1] It's maybe the doubt that you asked about, lingering. And then, you blessed us the other day with the question, [Mooji] Yes. Put yourself in the prison [Mooji] And what? [Q.1] You blessed us with this. [Q.1] And so to the best of my ability, I've been working with this. And ... [Mooji] That practice cannot go very far. Can the perceiver be perceived? What is perceiver? What is perceived? Everything. Everything is perceived. Even your sense that you are sitting here The sense of 'other' is perceived. The sense of scripture and their meanings Where is the perceiving happening? Where? Here. It's perceived here. [Q.1] Yes. [Mooji] The action of perceiving is also known. So it is also perceived. [Q.1] There is a ... [Mooji] That which is perceiving, That which is aware Outside of you? You being what? You see, we are used to saying to ourselves, The one in the photograph, on the passport, the one in the mirror, All are phenomenal references, no? All those phenomenal references are not that which perceives them. That which perceives them, Is it material or immaterial? It also naturally arises as 'I'. This 'I', is it personal or impersonal? It's following from, [Q.1] Yes. [Mooji] Is the perceiver phenomenal? Perceiver meaning all that is happening through the senses and the mind, in the form of time and space, relationships, coming and going, And everything that shows up The action of consciousness is phenomenal, is perceived. What is perceiving them? [M.] That they are perceived is a fact or not? [Mooji] OK. Now use that fact. And can it even be stated that, it is a fact that they are perceived? That which perceives them ... That which perceives them That which perceives them, We're not going to go on to other questions You've got to solve this one. This question pertains to everybody here. You don't have another question which is more important than this, That which is causing of knowing, feeling, sensing, remembering, thinking, desire, aversion, all of this comes in. It is watched or known by something. Or it's watched and known. Is it by something? Is it by any phenomenon that is taking credit for all of these things? It says, 'Yes, I know'. Can this perceiver, can it be identified? [Group member speaking] 'I'. [M.] Come, come, come. What? [Questioner 2] There is a sense of 'I' You know, that you are perceiving. [Mooji] There's a sense of 'I' perceiving, OK. This sense of 'I' perceiving looks like what? [Q.2] It doesn't look like anything. [Q.2] No. [Q.2] It sees what looks like something [Mooji] Who is saying this? Out of which mouth is this coming? Is it not that which is the cause of perceiving, and the witness of perceiving? What does it look like? Male or female? What race does it come from? What religion is it? [Group member] There are no qualities. [Mooji] No quality! Can you bear this? Who has to bear this? You can't deny that all that appears in the form of the mind are observable phenomenon. [M.] All are clouds passing. Right? [M.] That are witnessed. [M.] Now we're stating, but all this is known. [M.] It was known yesterday, last year, And that they come and go, By what is it known? Don't create. You don't need to create. To create, you have to go back to the mind which is also something that you witness. What is here? Don't invent. The fact is already that. The fact is already here, That which perceives, And if so, Does the show go on? Somebody give Rita a microphone. You stay live. Stay with yours. Give her your microphone. Keep it hot. Come. [Questioner 3] Guruji, [Mooji] Where is the impersonal Self? [Mooji] Is it the impersonal Self speaking now? [Q.3] Never. [Q.3] It can't be the person. [M.] The person is also seen. [M.] The personal sense, the claimer of things, Something says, 'Yes, me ...' Something behind it goes, 'No it's not'. [Q.3] It can only be the impersonal Self. [Q.3] Because there's nothing else. [Q.3] No, it's me as well. [Q.3] Yes. [Q.3] I am. I am ... [Mooji] So it is playing It is even beyond personal and impersonal. It's not comparable. [Q.3] Yes. [M.] Are we into a zone of abstractions now? Like you have to imagine this? No, because imagination as an action [Group member] Guruji. [Mooji] OK. You come. [Questioner 4] So Guruji, it just became clear that in Amrita's statement, when she said, [M.] Yes. [Q.4] I could see that mechanism happening As if the real seeing lives in a memory and is actually taken by a shape. And it's as if the inquiry is stuck there. [Mooji] What will be seeing this? [Q.4] It's also a shape. [M.] That's what she said, 'It is also me'. It's also playing the person but it is beyond the person. It's impersonal. It cannot be seen. But it appears to be seen [Q.4] Yes. [M.] Like we used the example, you go out now and get some clay. Go get some clay. Bring the clay. What is the shape of clay? Whatever it picks up is the shape of it. You take some clay Make the shape of a bird or a man. You put them in the kiln. You fire them. Now you can say, 'Look, look, look! Is that what clay is? Is it right to say, 'This clay is a fish?' 'Clay is a man. Clay is a bird.' No. You can say What is the quintessence They are all comprised of ... [M.] It has to be out of consciousness. The phenomenal and the non-phenomenal, everything that is perceivable is made out of the clay of consciousness. [Q.4] Guruji, anything that I report about or have issues with, or that comes, is only a shape that happens. [M.] You have to look at this, also, testify to your sense of a personal self That makes you feel like, this is 'you', Part of our purpose of taking a form and coming into this life right now, is to exhaust certain vasanas that were not burnt in the last life. OK? So we don't know how much is left to clear our account. [Q.4] Yes. before you finish clearing your account. You still have to clear your account. Whether you return in another body to this Earth or to another plane. You see? It's not a punishment. Actually, depending on you are either a victim of it, [Questioner 2] Babaji, I have a question about consciousness, like in this looking. Because consciousness somehow ... [M.] I want to tell you something. [Mooji] You're all avoiding my statement. I put you in the electric chair, and you are already in the electric chair, but somehow you found a switch to turn it off. And you start to talk about, 'What about if we jump off a cliff instead?' Because I have made a statement that has cornered you. And you're wriggling out of it by thinking you have another question. There is no other question right now. 'Yeah, but can we look at it this way?' No. No. For me? No, you do. Somebody finish my question and be finished by my question. Go. Remind me where we reached I'm not here to make more episodes. It's a one episode film. [Questioner 5] We were at the point to say, that there is no perceiver in that way. [Q.5] There is no entity. [Q.5] We were at the question [M.] Yes. The perceiving we know. [M.] The object of perception we know. [M.] But what has caused the perceiving This is my question. Because everything else was out there pointing to the objects of perception. Object of perception brought you [M.] Who is the subject of perception? [M.] The subject of experiencing, the subject of being is who? Where is it? [Q.5] It is not speaking, Guruji. [M.] Who is speaking on behalf of it? [M.] Yes, who is speaking? [Q.5] Yes. [M.] I'm asking whatever is speaking [Q.5] It is also itself. [Mooji] So the speaking is also [Q.5] Yes. [Mooji] How can it be identified, [Q.5] Only by itself. [Mooji] So in this room, where is it? [Q.5] In everyone. [Mooji] Hiding? [Questioner 5 laughs] [Mooji] This is a game of hide and seek [Questioner 6] You ask also, when we come, [Mooji] Quick, quick now! [Q.6] When we come to this, you also ask, I need to clarify with you, or I need to ... [M.] But, she just answered for you. [Q.6] Yes. It is seen by Itself. [Mooji] Yes. And you are what? [Q.6] That. [Mooji] That's the answer. That is a good answer. And who is going to evaluate the evidence? You see, your mind cannot bear this because it is the eternal student going from country to country, religion to religion, form to form, avoiding, avoiding. Now I've caught you! Now you can fly wherever you want to, and tell me where you're going to escape to. But of course, You can imagine many escapes. Because all the escapes were imagined. All the discoveries were imagined. All the separation was imagined. And who are you going to fool now? [Q.6] Guruji, but you said in the beginning, that there is this great opportunity here. [Q.6] There is a great sense of urgency. [Q.6] No more hiding. No more running away. [M.] Yes. Who determines Who is to determine? Who is going to determine Who has found Happily, happily! Mind is still ... but mind is still running for our vote. You see? I'm watching you. Give it to her. I'm watching how much mind is saying, We kick 'buts' now. 'But what about? What about?' Now total boredom with that one. [Mooji] Say. [Questioner 7] It feels that the space is seeing [Mooji] 'That' means 'that'. Use now 'this'. 'That' has a little more distance. 'This' implies no distance. Use the 'I' that is not the object of attention. If you say 'I' now, where is there distance in this one? You see, because I know, we start to turn it into maybe some So you can escape. [M.] If you want to escape, escape. Keep your miserable self. You are free to do this. But we came here, I thought, to look and to have a culmination of this. To look and to verify, to have no escape. And is it the Self that says, Is it the Self that's caught saying this? So you cannot apply your local mind to this type of inquiry. Local mind is to put things on a scale and measure the weight of them. 'This is 2 euros 20, this is 3 euros ...' No, you cannot use that mind here. What is the end result now? [Questioner 8] Babaji, I am using this moment, [Q.8] to be in the light of this Not turn it into intellectual ... [Mooji] Is it 'This' that is saying this? [Mooji] This now is intention. Do you know how far we have come? So even, subtler than intention. Even the greatest intention, 'I swear by Almighty God!' 'I swear by Almighty God No, it's still not it. Who can keep their promise? Which being can keep their promise? [silence] I don't even know if God is promising anything because the people can't keep their promise! 'That I'll be there to listen Unless you are trying to trap God. So, subtler than intention. Intention is, 'Yes, I'm going to do this now'. It's good. Last week it was really good. But today, how good is it? [Q.8] Now, this moment, I choose it. [Mooji] This moment. [Questioner 9] That is the chop [Mooji] Yes. [silence] A rare one put their head on the block, and it was said, 'Keep your head because you gave your heart'. Then your head will not trouble you. How can you give God your head A human being must find the difference between They are mere symbols. They are not physical. Do you see? So, we're not taking anymore questions now. No more questions. except to keep up a bluff. [silence] You see, I said, I will come here for 20 minutes. Now he sent rain to trap me in this place here. And I love it. Do you see this? [silence] Mind and ego are fighting for survival but mind with ego means death. In reality there is no death. But in the play there is death and life. But identity is pride. Proud. Mistrusting. [silence] I don't know who among you here can feel the presence of God in this moment, flowing inside your heart. He has not come to give you any teaching. [silence] Too much happiness here. Too much joy. Sometimes unbearable joy. [silence] He knows the one He called and who came. [silence] We can turn off these lights a bit now? This one. It's good. Enough for now. Ahh! Nice cinema. Very good. [silence] If you have come to that before which there was nothing, even now there is nothing as things, then hear this. 'I have no birth, no death, and no duties to perform. I have never done anything, I am purely Brahman beyond all qualities. So how could either bondage or liberation If God is all-pervading, immovable, whole, without any parts, then there is no division in Him at all. How then could He be regarded as being within or without? Inside or outside? The whole universe is shining as one, without any separation or breaks. No split. The very idea of maya is itself, Know that duality and non-duality are merely concepts of the mind. The world of form and the formless void. Neither of these exists independently. In the One, there is neither separation or union. Truly, there is nothing but Shiva, alone.' Shiva here is God, the pure Self, eternal existence, That. [silence] Copyright 2024 Mooji Media Ltd.
