- Morning, guys. Here in New Orleans. First impressions. Quite a wild place. It's my first time here, so today, we're gonna meet up with a local who grew up here and said, &quot;Peter, I can show you a New Orleans that Christopher, you ready for this? - I'm ready. (Peter laughs) - [Peter] So, what's - It depends on what decade it is, right? So, in the 1980s it was rough, but in the 1970s, it wasn't. In the 2000... After Katrina, it was great. So when? And for who? Like, for me, it's different than a lotta the people that - [Peter] So, that's - Oh yeah. - [Christopher] House by house. - [Peter] &quot;House by house&quot;! - Oh yeah. where are we? Midtown? - This is Esplanade Ridge. - [Christopher] You could - [Peter] Okay, so, what's the story here? This is a nicer neighborhood? - Definitely. Definitely nicer. It's younger. It's 1870s up. Probably was completely filled up. You gotta remember this Once you run outta room, There's no more room. You might replace, but a lot of these houses were like, for instance, this house. This was a house where somebody made a living off of commerce that and this bayou connects to the lake. The land kind of settled 6,000 years ago. The best you can tell, Native Americans started They called it the land of many tongues, which is kinda cool, because, from the very beginning, all these different and it's to that day. To this day, it's the same thing. You've got many different of all different kinds, to trade, to do business. This is one of the old buildings. It's called the Pitot House, an ancient building built in 1761. - [Peter] Rookie question. New Orleans? depends on the zip code. - Oh. - How 'bout this zip code? - Oh, this would be probably...

There's a tremendous change. - For the better or for the worse? - Well, I would say- - Depends, huh? Just like this neighborhood here, we got a lotta older all the way down to the end that live in these, homeowner here, but if they... As they pass on, give it to the younger It'll start changing. - You know, the problem is when they sell it to these outta-towners. - That's right. That's right. - [Peter] The Yankees come in and...

This is impressive. - [Christopher] This is a doctor. This used to be my - [Peter] What is that? - [Christopher] That's the Brown Mansion. I've been in that monster. - [Peter] Okay, interesting, they're not paving the roads. - No, they're not paving the roads, not a concern. as a politician? No matter how corrupt things might be, if you keep the roads paved, you sorta keep people happier 'cause they're on the roads every day? - Yeah. right? police, and roads, you know, basics. We prioritize different things. You know, the problem when is every sentence has to &quot;This is a fact, but The unofficial tagline of New Orleans is the city that care forgot. We were forsaken, but this - [Peter] Yeah, I can see. - And it's a sliver. This is dry ground. If we go this way, it's not dry ground. - [Peter] So when Katrina getting flooded. getting flooded. - [Peter] Okay. - [Christopher] This one's up for sale. This is modeled after Tara, the plantation. that's going for? - [Christopher] Three million, relatively cheap compared - [Peter] Oh yeah. Yeah, that would be a fortunate in some of the other city. the archives in the city, and she's been there quite some time. This is a fun one right here we should just kinda take a look at. They call this the Wedding Cake House. That's a beauty. - [Peter] That is a beauty. - [Christopher] That's one - So, as someone that doesn't have much even though I live in As they say, the more south you get the more North it is, right? - The history of all these homes, were they all plantation owners? - No. come from? - [Peter] 'Cause that's what I hear a lot in my Southern videos. these are Merchants. - [Christopher] New Orleans, during the Civil War, because these merchants didn't - [Peter] With their trade. - [Christopher] Yeah, they Once all this settles, And in fact, the city - So, who worked for the Was it the immigrants? Was it the Blacks? - It was immigrants. It was all people from - Seriously? Yeah, in fact, there's a section of town we're gonna go through where they literally named the streets so that Americans would understand 'em, like Camp and First St. - [Peter] Because all the - Yeah, a lotta these names were... This is the area where This is State St. There's streets that are We have a Mardi Gras parade, - So, when people talk it's always been one of the technically most in the country, right? - Most homicides per capita or in the top five, something like that. - It was founded upon lotta trouble, yeah. - Okay, so, neighborhoods They're safe? - Car break-ins, robberies. I had a childhood friend who and here's a good point. Here's the big Catholic - [Peter] Wow. - [Christopher] Lot of and they'll leave the car unlocked, right? - Okay. Tulane University, at least 50% Jewish. Not always was the case. They used to be a lot that lived here when it was a merchant city and not so much anymore. This is our only private street in the entire city right here. - [Peter] &quot;Private street,&quot; through a gate. - [Peter] So what's down there? - [Christopher] Yeah, Bob Dylan lived in this neighborhood one time. Drew Brees lived here. - [Peter] It's very class-orientated here. - Yes, absolutely. It's centered a lot Like, let's say this. Let's just put it this way. You can get into some Mardi Gras krewes. You'd be allowed. Just pay your dues. You can go in the krewe. Harry Connick's krewe, You know Harry Connick, Jr.? Musician? He has a really... Orpheus, it's a really successful You and I can get in that. You and I can get into Bacchus. Might take a little bit of Maybe before this video, maybe. (Christopher laughs) - But both of us- - You're not going anywhere now after this. - Both of us have no chance of getting into Comus, Momus, blah, blah, blah. - I don't even know what These are like fraternities? (Christopher laughs) What is this? - They're Mardi Gras krewes. - &quot;Crews&quot;? Like, so your - Your gang. - &quot;Your gang&quot; so you're rat pack. And then you go and eat at night together? Yeah. - And you have a celebration together? - Yeah, kind of like- - I've never seen Mardi - I would encourage- for it. You know what would really be something is to get your viewers to go Takes about three hours, and the real challenge - Okay, so you're trying is what you're doing. the channel, yeah. I'll kill your ability to and you can kill my channel: &quot;It's him!&quot; - [Christopher] I don't That's my grandmother's. She and her husband bought that in 1930. He was an indentured and they were an arranged marriage. - &quot;Indentured servant to his brother.&quot; How did that work out? - He had to pay the shipping. You had to pay for shipping back then. - [Peter] So his brother was the boss? - Yeah, Serafino Dominici. - [Peter] Italian heritage. - And that house is a - [Peter] &quot;Bargeboard,&quot; - [Christopher] Well, this is a barge. This floated down the river. - Oh, okay. when this house was they cut it up, and they - Okay, very interesting. Okay, so, you've lived and you've moved out recently. - Yeah. - Where to? - Brookhaven, Mississippi. - Why? - It just got to be... I would say this. The problems went like this. The fun went here. It used to be the problems and this is a fun place, but it just got to be too much, and come on, I'm not... You know, how many times How many times can you go to Jazz Fest? It was just got to be &quot;let's Life's short, right? - Okay, so you just wanna - Yeah, so we have a farm, an old house. It's 150 years. - Ah, that's great. - And it's... My front yard is about half a mile, and I look out, and I In the morning, you see - But you've always been a city boy. - Yeah. - Isn't that... Is that a tough adjustment? - No, it was easy. Was incredibly easy. I tell you what really got We ran away from the When we came back, I had to try to do business It had been five weeks. No, we ran seven times in two years and had no power for five no power, running on a generator, charging your phone, trying It just gets to be like, &quot;Okay, I have to somehow make money.&quot; - [Peter] You're working - Yeah. - [Christopher] Yeah, but In reality, I think that is to be able to have something here and then something there. - [Peter] You've only been - Yeah. - [Peter] This is a great neighborhood. - [Christopher] This This is more locals. People live here. They come here. They shop here. - It's really nice. - [Peter] Very creative. - [Christopher] And it goes - [Peter] I'm sorry, who owned this? - [Christopher] Nine Inch Nails dude. - [Peter] Trent Reznor. - Yeah, right here. &quot;Pretty Hate Machine,&quot; - [Christopher] Yeah. This Now we're in the 1830s. This was the second Look at this one. This one's getting fixed up. - [Peter] Oh, wow, beautiful. So, people are moving in? - Yeah. - Oh yeah. This is... It's expensive to live here. For the most part, a lotta There's a lotta of cities turned to apartments. This was Anne Rice's house. She used to write up in When she lived here, I and yeah, she wrote some of her classic books You've been seeing, for well over four miles. Now it's time to... We're downtown, and we're We're entering into what's a lot of it built by That will then lead us We're very close to the Quarter now. Whoa, urgh. - [Peter] They're working - Oh yeah. That changed pretty quickly. - [Christopher] I mean, - [Peter] Yeah, it is, really. - [Christopher] This is There's still some machine shops. Used to be warehouses. This is once a cigar factory right here. - [Peter] Is shipbuilding a thing here? - Used to be. There used to be a place a major, major Navy shipyard. Yes, ships used to be There were some neighborhoods built, but more or less, this is... I wanna say 1820s. This is the former Economy Iron Works. I mean, they used to do ship parts. - [Peter] What're the big businesses here in these high rises? - [Christopher] So, let's say this. 55% of the economy is tourism. - [Peter] For the whole city. - For the whole city. - Oh my God. it would've been 60-70% oil-related or at least something high like that. Oil's gone. That went to Houston. We had a population of Today, it's 350, half the size. All of this infrastructure was built for twice as many people. It was a, mindset-wise, very focused on business, the opportunities of the river. And then it kinda shifted which is more empathetic, (water burbles) This is ground zero, in theory. This is where the Native somewhere long, long time ago, and the reason why is... Remember Bayou St. John early on in the video, near- - Right? Right behind that big church, which is called the St. Louis Cathedral, you go back 20-30 blocks. You now are the entrance to the lake. This is the river that drains I know you're gonna love, Every 18 seconds, the weight of the Empire - [Peter] Wow. - So you're draining, like, all the way from... This water comes from Canada. It comes from Ohio, Pennsylvania. So does the products that are... Right? Think about the products that are coming from it. - If you put the city If you put it further upriver, and we've gotta think The American Indians so the French said, &quot;Thanks, we'll take that,&quot; put some cannons up: &quot;We got it. Now we own it.&quot; They understood this massive river. It's draining something important, right? It's pretty big. It's It's bigger than the That way about 100 miles That's the entrance to the world, so you've got this massive breadbasket meets the world right here. - [Peter] And the next big with the Mississippi? (chuckles) it's the next, (Peter chuckles) but yeah, the next big After that is Memphis, but It was a barge, just like They would come down the river, and before steam power, they couldn't get 'em back up the river, so they cut 'em up and make houses. That's how important the cargo was, and that cargo is warehoused here. This, in a way, is a big Amazon warehouse, you know, if you wanna You're putting all the food, the pelts... All these things that come from upriver are brought here, organized. And then they're put on sailing ships, and they go to distant lands. - Okay, these days, does New - Yes. like, a tariff. So, there's a barge coming let's just say, for example? And it has to go through New Orleans out to the Gulf of Mexico, and it just goes right through. What does New Orleans get outta that? - Oh no, the barge can't go in the ocean. Look at this ship right - [Peter] Everything - [Christopher] Yeah. - [Peter] And that's - That's controlled here. - [Peter] Got ya. - (indistinct) All right. - [Christopher] Oh yeah, This is where slave Remember we talked about merchants. Up until 1807 when it before then, this is - But there were a lotta - Oh, that's a good one. Under the French and Spanish rule, you can earn your freedom. You could buy it, give it, be granted it. In New Orleans, about were free people of color, and that's about double the Now, I think that does... What's interesting, it even to this day that there were people (boisterous music) This is Pirates Alley. Look at this natural drainage system. (boisterous music fades) These are all the flags (touching music fades) So, Louis XIV, king of France, he led a lot of crusades That's him up there. He's a saint, but he (intense music) Here is Joan of Arc. She freed France as a 16-year-old woman. She was captured and burned alive, but she's a French hero, French saint. (congregation applauds) - Christopher, clapping in - Well, we're New Orleanian Catholics. There's a few rules we don't follow. Ever since 300 years ago, the religious people that would come from I mean, ya gotta realize: They sent over- - Just the pioneers and - Whoo, it was bad. So, Catholicism, even to is maybe a little different It's more relaxed. It's more easy. - [Peter] Christopher, what with the porches up there? - Well, this is really from the Spanish. This was all rebuilt because the whole place and here we are. - [Passerby] One that was - [Peter] The famous Bourbon Street. - Yeah. - [Peter] So, at night, - I have literally stood here and, during Mardi Gras, picked That's how packed it was, how dense. - [Peter] So this is - Yes. of Las Vegas. - [Christopher] Yes. (ardent metal music continues) Yeah, it's what people know. It's fun to walk down. - [Peter] Yeah. - At night. This is owned by a family I and the Karno family Louis Armstrong kept the Star all his life. That was his homage to the because they got him out of being bad and gave him the - [Peter] (laughs) Look at... In the middle of the drinking section. - Yeah, that's a ouch. - So most tourists are coming in, flying in, staying in a hotel near here, French Quarter, going home, right? Is that the majority of tourists? - They might take a house where you went, or they're coming for one We actually even have more than that now. There's something like come to this city every year, and it's a city of 350,000 people. - The greater metro's... What? 1,200,000? Something like that? but you're not going there. - You're not going- - Yeah, yeah. - [Christopher] Every I keep thinking we're walking right by things but you gotta draw a line. - [Peter] That's a whole - There's so much, like, even - Yeah. - It's when you take the turn and you walk down the courtyard and it's just... This is one of the oldest Antoine's is quite nice. It has a lot of these rooms that are designed for the Mardi - [Peter] Okay. - And it's another one of those things. Like, we could do a video (Peter laughs) - [Peter] They don't go away, huh? - [Christopher] No. - [Peter] They just fall from - They're trying to do away Be nice to have better throws - Maybe I will not have (indistinct). - [Peter] Look at this guy. - [Christopher] He's been here forever. - [Passerby] Right, - [Peter] He's good. - [Christopher] Yeah. - [Peter] Hello, Sir. - Hello, take one. Leave one. - [Peter] I will. I'll leave a few. - Okay. I like that (censored).

(music stops) (passerby laughs) - [Passerby] I'm sorry (indistinct). - I can remember when I and starting in about 1996-'97, I would go to Austin, San and people would say, &quot;Where you from?&quot; &quot;New Orleans.&quot; Go, &quot;Oh, why?&quot; I remember getting that a But after Katrina, it was I remember the first and I said, &quot;From New Orleans,&quot; and I got, &quot;Cool. Really?&quot; And I went, &quot;What?&quot; - &quot;Huh.&quot; - It's never stopped. - It changed at that time. - 2005-2006, something happened. - Because there's a vibe - I think, generational. I think it was generational. (rejoicing music) (rejoicing music continues) (brakes squeak) (window squeaks) - [Driver] Did you check your (latch clicks) - Oh, man. - Oh, we're at that point? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You know, I went through that. - I know.

It was real bad, but the They wasn't all that. You know, they... Wouldn't nobody try to but anyway, if it wasn't I wouldn't have got back home. - [Peter] Okay. - I couldn't find a job out there. - [Peter] In Arkansas. - In Arkansas. - Right after Katrina, in Little Rock. - [Peter] Did this flood out here? - No. - &quot;None of this flooded.&quot; and trees blowing down and all that. - Okay, does Katrina still Or is it distant memory? - [Peter] You don't think about it anymore it's, like, so long ago? - Well, it's been long, but you think about it all the time because, you know, you miss your friends, your people that you- - Some people died. or lotta people died. - [Peter] Just a lotta - Right, but a lotta people stood, and a lot of 'em just not you know, and it's real bad, bro. - They went to Houston, Dallas. - Dallas, right, but Most of 'em went to Texas, and - [Peter] Ninth Ward, still, of the hurricane. Man, that's really bad out Now, they've fixed some of the ports up. - Yeah, what that guy name is, bruh. - Brad Pitt? - Brad Pitt, he fixed up He fixed up a quite few of 'em. - [Peter] Really? Brad Pitt did? - Brad Pitt, yeah, he built houses out there for the people. Most of it is still not but a lotta people just like the East. That's not too whacked out. That's all messed up, you know. It is. - [Peter] East Side? - Yeah. - Out East, New Orleans East. - New Orleans East. - [Peter] What's out there? - Well, ain't nothing You know, they have low-income but now they can't... Now they fixing different houses up, and they can't afford 'em now, so it's... - [Peter] Real estate's going up? - Yeah. - [Peter] Okay, okay. - Buying up the houses, - Kicking out Grandma. - [Peter] &quot;Kicking out Grandma&quot;? - Yeah. - [Peter] Where's Grandma go? - With the kids. out East, huh? (Dwight laughs) She good. She gotta go somewhere. - Mississippi with Christopher? - Yeah. - Yeah, somebody gotta take care of her. (Christopher laughs) I never forget about... They didn't have no gas one time, and it was the storm. - Remember you told me to go in the yard, but the lady cross the - Sian? Yeah. - But they had one left. You said go in there and see if- - You still got it, and take it, and that gas lasted me for a whole week. No gas stations or or nothing, bruh. It was tragedy. - I had some- there's no gas around. - No gas. a different (chuckles) hurricane. - That was Isaac. - [Christopher] Band (Dwight speaks indistinctly) - [Christopher] From Caledonia, Ireland. Whoa, died in 1844. (drumsticks clack) - [Peter] So it's just they have to keep everything above ground. Nothing can go below, right? - The water table's so high that, if you put a coffin, right, that's reasonably sealed up, it's going to pop up. You can't weigh it down enough. You can use the real estate I hate to say it. How The bodies are gonna And then what they do is and after a year, you can - [Peter] Push into the what? - Crypt. You can push 'em down. You can push 'em... Because of the humidity and temperature, the coffin wood's just gonna deteriorate. So's the body, sorta, within a year. Ya open it up. You have a new body a year later, so you take the old one, and you take a rake, and you push it down, and there's a hole in the back, and you go- - Yeah, and it... And there's gonna be a bottom. There'll be a opening in the bottom, and you push the bones to the bottom, so now you can put a new coffin in. - [Peter] So there are multiple people that are each one of these gravestones. Well, you could see right here ya got two. That's nothing. You got some of these that'll have dozens. - [Peter] So, it stays within the family? The rules are that you have to be... The owner... The owners can decide who can go in. - Oh, okay. The owners can say yes, but if you're blood relative, - Okay. - So you can't come into my family tomb, but if I said, yeah. - Maybe. Will you let me one day, Christopher? (Dwight speaks indistinctly) I mean, I got some time, but you know, maybe. - So yeah, it's... I think it's just, say, in this city. There's not a lotta land. You gotta remember 18... Well, up to 1915, the flooded areas flood. There's no pumps. If it floods, it floods, so real estate's a premium. This is not productive real estate, but given that it's a very Catholic city, you have the need, just like they have in many places where they're and they're gonna put you in a nice spot. (sirens shriek) (road murmurs) (engine buzzes) - [Peter] How much of the city do you think's living - 50% on the high side. - [Peter] &quot;50%&quot;! - Well, okay, so let's How much did the government... My tagline for New Orleans is you bought it in 1803 and ya underinvested everywhere you could; whoops, can't park there; (horn honks) you did not pay your There's certain states from the federal government than others. Like, New York probably pays a lot more to the federal government than it gets. There's a lotta poor people here. It's a service-based economy, so nobody's really getting ahead, making minimum wage or so you're making ends meet. You're kinda working in It's an up-and-down industry. You're not getting ahead. There's zip codes here where the average wage - Yeah, and you're paying... You're spending every cent. - And you're going to get and you should. And when you look at how much the country prior to Katrina, it was low, very low, shockingly low. Where it comes from, Like, when we saw Ken earlier today, he works in the business of the port, things that flow through the port. We saw the guy in the that stays still for so long, obviously living off of tourism, and the person we're mixture of tourism. - [Peter] Would this be considered a middle-class neighborhood here? - [Peter] But some old big homes. - [Christopher] Old big homes. - [Peter] Well, okay, I see That's definitely not... - I mean, they're nice homes. They were in their day. Not anymore. Now, you are starting to see changes. Like, here comes a house. Okay, you're holding out a Jazz Fest flag. Okay, you moved here from somewhere. You got a Jazz Fest flag. Ya came from outta town. You got a good house price. Grandma got kicked out. You're doing okay. - [Peter] That's a pump station right there. yeah, out. - [Peter] So, they're going full time. - No, no, dry spells. Here's a house that's got... You know, some hurricane and nobody's put the roof back on, but people are living there. - [Peter] So a lotta on their homes, right? If they're owned outright? - If they're owned Yeah, there's a good chance you don't. Can't afford it. Too expensive. - [Peter] Home insurance - Oh my gosh, yeah, it's - Like, how much on a, - Oh man, I don't know. - 'Kay. - More. - Just to close that conversation out, you were saying, your they had to close down the school. You were saying off-camera. Because of what? It was crazy story. Yeah, he had... He would run into situations where, when the kids just Now, this is pre-Katrina, where it was a little bit more wild, but there would be holes in the ceiling, so you wanna shut... You wanna go home, you like, just go pee through the hole. Why go to the bathroom? - And they'd shut down the school. - Shut down the school. You got pee raining down through (Peter huffs) Also, too, why show up? So that's not... Like, okay, whose fault? And then if ya somehow break Where we working? Where is Peter going to - Look, I was in Jackson, Mississippi. - Oh yeah, true. - And I said, &quot;You know, if the person has the education and the skills and the work ethic, even if they're living&quot;- - You're fine. they can take a bus and go five miles.&quot; - They're fine. - They're fine, but if they which a lot don't, then you're screwed. - Yeah. - And it just keeps repeating. - And it just keeps... It's on repeat. - And do they want it? No. Does anybody here want that? No. I feel like it's not a problem that's being addressed - No. - It's like, &quot;Eh, just let it be. Let those cycles continue.&quot; - I'm not an expert on this, but I know, like, Louisiana No, we don't get royalties for all the oil that's That would fund fixing - But then again, what I've it's not just money. - Yeah. - So it has to be like, &quot;How do you&quot;- - It's a bigger... - Bigger, yeah. - Bigger than that. - You have to create an industry - Yeah, but a lotta people just need... I think we're all lacking, We don't have much leadership and there are a lot of kids that need that leadership. living in this, how much do you care? Are you coming here? Are you gonna be here? You' gonna try to- - You stay in your... You do your best to get in - Ya stay in your bubble, yeah. Tough. - Tough, but to be you're raising a family. You're working your butt off to pay all the bills, your Like, you're not gonna be coming over here trying to help anyone. You're just trying to survive yourself. - Even if your income - Oh yeah. - Yeah, you're just trying to make it. - Yeah, that's a lot of us. - All right. All right, let's do this. - [Walter] Doing, Brother Chris? - [Christopher] Look at this place. How are ya, man? - Good to see you, man. Good to see you. - That's my friend Peter. - All right, Brother. - Nice to meet you. - I'm the big chief of the Mardi Gras Indian. As a Mardi Gras Indian, we became what we became because we wanted to During those days, we Anything we did, had to do it secretly. Had to sneak and do it. Mardi Gras existed in Alabama first. And then it came to New Orleans, and when it came to New Orleans, we just wanted to participate, and since they didn't allow a group of guys said, &quot;We gonna create our own Mardi Gras, but upon creating our own Mardi Gras, we gonna use the regalia of another group of people who were which was the Native Americans. So what we did, we made suits and sew with As you can see, that's I'm putting stones on. This stuff is done by hand. It takes time. Those are seed beads. It takes time to bead things like that. - [Peter] Big chief, who's doing this? - Well, community, family, friends, you know, whoever willing to to keep preserving the culture because it was a culture that was driven from being oppressed. And so we keep it and continued it going to let people know that we had to fight to become a part of this, and here in New Orleans, we had to fight to become Yeah, so we just continued it going, man, and even this shirt, it commemorates me masking for 30 years without missing a year. I haven't missed a year This culture saved my life. It took me off the streets. I was a bad guy at a young age, and a guy said, &quot;Man, and guess what. I haven't been any trouble ever since. - That's great, man. This was three years ago. - [Peter] Beautiful. - [Walter] Yes. Notice the, like... Everything is done by - [Peter] Yep. - [Walter] Even the no sewing machine. Everything is stone for That's exactly how- - [Peter] This is your store. - Yes, it is. I'm the big chief of the This is a dream I had. 10 years ago, like, when I saw that everybody else was making money off the Mardi Gras Indians and not compensating us - [John] Hey, boy. - Hey, John. How you doing, John? Yes, it is. So what I decide to do, - So Creole Apache, is that connected to Mescalero - This was a name that I came up with because I love the Apache war spirits. - They're the warriors. - I love the warriors. So what happened was I did my research Apache's normally from out West, but bands of 'em traveled to Louisiana, so that's why I felt You see what I'm saying? - Yeah. we are Mardi Gras Indians. We're not per se... We're not trying to be Native American, even though we have it in our blood. We're not trying to be this and that, but you can make up for be a Mardi Gras, and you can create a name. - [Peter] This is great Who's doing this? - [Walter] Yeah, I'm doing the graphics and everything on everything you practically see. - [Walter] I do the I press my own T-shirts and everything. - [Peter] Yeah, but the - Yeah, yeah, I do I do everything on my own, basically, but the thing is, in the earlier days... Let's just say, when the honestly, they saw a group of people. They called them Indians and named them, or the Indians told, no matter how it was, but the history books say that their color was lighter-skinned when their color was this skin, but that's history. I don't dwell too much on that. I move forward in life, but actually, we were being able to... When we ran away from... Let's just say, like, When some of us ran away, we ran away, and we were coveted by the They showed us the ways of the land, and they gave us an opportunity to learn to be able to hide from them. - Did you learn from the Chitimacha? - Well, they've let... There were many different names. There were many different There's some names not but the key is to know that from slaves and the Native no matter what color they were, that displayed, &quot;We gonna help you. We gonna show you the way Let's keep you to be and that was most important. So from that era, came to this era. That's why, when it came to use the regalia of the Native Americans, because they helped us when - [Peter] Okay, sorta paying respect to them. - [Peter] &quot;Homage,&quot; yeah, great. - There you go, my man (laughs). Watch this here, young man. I'm just gonna... Watch this. We'll take (Walter sings in foreign language) Sing, everybody (Walter sings in foreign language) Mardi gras moment (Walter sings in foreign language) Make no (indistinct) Make no hour Lord, have mercy We gon' have our fun Have our fun Nobody kneel Say, &quot;Nobody run&quot; Creole Apache Say that that's my gang Say the big chief's beautiful Say, &quot;That's my name&quot; Jump and (indistinct) We'll basically pick up a tambourine, a bottle, or can, or anything and just beat on, make some - [Christopher] Think about how that comes from Congo Square. - That's right, exactly. In the... Before Mardi Gras, everyone Black Indians were meeting up in Congo Square, just on... And on a Sunday, they did that, but when Mardi Gras came, they wanted to be more involved, and that's when we got a with the bigger plumes and the shiny stuff and more hand-sewing. We got more out-developed, but they started singing. Even today, on a Sunday, you can go to Congo Square and catch... A drum circle they call it, not many Indians but guys who played the just beating on the drums just having a little fun because that's definitely what we are. We are definitely a entertaining community culture, and whatever you think of ya sing about. - Okay. Christopher, you were saying here doing this. How many Mardi Gras tribes? - It's about from 30 to 40, honestly. - Wait. That's it? - Yeah, but remember, every Mardi Gras, all of them don't mask. For various reasons, but I make it my business to mask in order to preserve the culture. - Just to understand, all these tribes, these 30 to 40 native tribes, they're not native blood. - They could be, oh yeah. to the natives. - Right, but I'mma say this here. History won't tell us this, All of us have Native in our blood, because a lot of us wasn't born in Africa. We were born here. You - Yep. - But beyond that fact is you don't really have in order to keep the Mardi - Explain spy boy. What's spy boy? - Spy boy is a position in every tribe. In every tribe, there's a There's a gang flag, a wild man, big queen, chief scout, little chief. There's different positions, but the spy boy, like he explained... Once we start walking the the spy boy is the first that anyone sees, and he also spies. He lets us know if he see another tribe, 'cause some tribes, like and when I say aggressive, we wanna meet those guys. See, it's all about a competition, but you wanna meet every feather you see, so when we'll meet another tribe, spy boy gon' meet the spy boy, flag boy gon' meet their flag boy, big chief gon' meet their big chief, so on and so forth, when it comes to position, because, what we do, we challenge nowadays who could dress the best, who's the prettiest, who could sing the best, who can dance the best, who can jump the best. You know what I'm saying? We challenge in those areas. You know what I'm saying? It's the fun- - [Peter] It's competitive. - Yes, it is! Yes, it is, but the key is to be with people around the world and the youths, as well, here in locally and around the world. - Okay. - When you come to New Orleans, you come see Big Chief Beautiful. You know what I'm saying? - Yeah. a feather, if it's nothing but a feather, from the chief himself, you know? But there's something I want ya to see. I wanna give you a sight on something, you too, Chris, 'cause Come. Excuse the place 'cause I'm always creating. I beaded this over 20 years ago. This is the true story right here. Look at that story. Remember when I said that the red- - [Peter] That's not glue? - No, oh, listen, it's beading. - Beaded. See, what that story says- This is the Indian. What he doing? He's doing what? Freeing the what? - [Peter] He's freeing the slave. - That's right. - [Christopher] Cuffs. - [Peter] Breaking the chain. - That's the story. That's our true story, in correlation, the reason showing homage and giving thanks to them no matter what color they were. You know what I'm saying? No matter what color we showing homage, thanking them, and we're continuing it. (tambourine clinks) When you come back to New We gonna sing some Indian songs. One thing about it, you gonna haves a lotta fun and get deeply enriched in It's a pleasure all the time. - Pleasure. I'll see ya soon. - All right, my man. - [Peter] There it is. - 3,400 South Claiborne next to the Chicken &amp; Watermelon. (engine wheezes) - I'd love to see that - Oh, it would blow up, right? - Yeah, especially if he put on things. - I mean if all the tourists He's so charismatic, you know? - [Christopher] Tourists but he's getting started, which is great. - [Peter] Was this heavily flooded? - Yeah. - [Christopher] There's worse. - [Peter] So the Ninth where we're going, right? The reason why it was so bad is because the levee broke here and so this flooded bad, really bad. Out here flooded really, really bad. This is 15 feet underwater. So, this area, there was a break right Clearly, that house never (siren wails) - [Peter] Yep. - [Christopher] Yeah. That one did. - Oh, that one did. - [Peter] Yep, &quot;for sale.&quot; - [Christopher] Yeah. - [Peter] So, how far - Oh, to the roof, 10 feet. - So, this is where... I remember the footage at the time, boats-are-going-through-the-streets-type - This is it. This is bad. - This is where it was happening. - [Christopher] Yep, you see The government paid to raise your house. - [Peter] FEMA came in heavy here? - [Christopher] Oh You can see the air They raised the houses. It just means that, when the - [Peter] You get a little better chance. - [Christopher] You got This is the Musicians' Village area. - [Peter] Oh, wow! Okay. - [Christopher] Something I did not know. &quot;The People of Qatar.&quot; - [Peter] Wow. - [Christopher] &quot;Dave Matthews Band.&quot; - [Peter] &quot;Texas Roadhouse.&quot; - [Christopher] So they paid for this. It's still unfortunately - [Peter] - [Christopher] Yeah. - No grocery stores? where the nearest grocery store is. - [Peter] Yeah. Wow. Some homes, bars on the - [Christopher] Yeah, high crime. - [Peter] But not all of 'em. - Well, no bars, you're probably sufficiently If you look at a crime map, it's pretty intense, and it's violent. Doesn't mean that everybody's like that. It just means that it's something that's not getting the (Christopher laughs) (Peter laughs) That was good. This is the levees that - [Peter] Oh, right over here. - [Christopher] Yeah, yeah, - [Peter] And it was just gushing, rushing through here, huh? 'cause this water's connected to the lake. This is 15 feet. This is bad. - [Peter] &quot;15 feet.&quot; - This is people dying in their attics. Can't afford to leave. Can't afford to go get You know, they're sticking The water comes rushing in violently. In fact, I had a distant who was in a bed, disabled. He and the mom died in their house. These are the houses The guy had a good heart. Think there's real controversial topic. This is not an ecosystem. There's no groceries. There's not a lot of opportunity here, but culturally, people wanted to be back, and this was their land, and here comes a lot of to go build this area back. It is now... I think there's lawsuits. There's stuff about that these buildings were built defectively, shoddy, too quick. - [Peter] There's one right there? - Yeah, that's one, and high off the ground This one's prepared for But you look at the rot. Hold on. So, this building right here was built right after Katrina in a hurry. - [Peter] Okay. - Look at that porch. - [Peter] So the water's - [Christopher] No. - No? It's shoddy construction, poor materials. - [Peter] This street looks nicer. - [Christopher] Yeah. Yeah, this is... This actually looks much better. - [Peter] This looks way better. There's a lotta space - Well, there was once lotta houses. - [Peter] Okay, so, they just removed 'em. - [Peter] And put the grass back. - This is the levee that failed. - [Peter] Okay. - [Christopher] This failed. Now, picture, okay? I don't know how well it but you know, our heads above the top of that wall. That water was coming over the top. It was already brimming. - [Peter] Oh, wow. - [Christopher] Yeah. Oh, here we go. Here's a nice little marker. - [Peter] &quot;The breach of the during Hurricane Katrina created a pivotal moment when flood walls designed and built by the failed.&quot; (Peter laughs) Yeah. - [Peter] So, these are all rebuilt. And they're done right this time? - Yes, so, this is when I was talking So, you didn't invest in the schools. The levees that existed here, the pilings did not go down They were put in the ground, but the minute the water pushed here, they just bent over. Today, in theory, this where, even though you might it's not going to just bend over. The old ones were kind of optical levees. As soon as you put 'em and that's what happened here, and boy, that particular sign really does lay the blame, right? (Peter chuckles) You know, the U.S. Army - And they've done some amazing - Yes, they have. - Like the Intercoastal. Oh yeah. - Hoover Dam, right? Can you count that as theirs? - I don't know. - &quot;Issue new guidelines &quot;Improved safety for residents So, over 1,000 people died. A lot of 'em died here, because this happened so abruptly so fast that ya didn't see it coming, and there was... The poverty here... Oh, look at the mildew on that one. - [Peter] Yeah. - Yeah, there's something really bad. Like, that's not good. - [Peter] Yeah, you - Nope, and it's gonna I can see rot. You know, hopefully, for that building, they got it for free. - [Peter] Your mosquitoes - Yeah, right. Look at that one. - [Peter] I gotta say than in the nice neighborhood. - True. - [Christopher] Yeah. Good intention. That didn't happen. (brooding music) (brooding music fades) The guy that wrote the book &quot;Midnight in he said there were 12 characters in... Was it Charleston? Then he did the book in Venice, and he says it was about 100, and he says, &quot;I am so confused on where He says, &quot;They're on every corner.&quot; - Right? - And it... He never finished the book. He got an advance. Never finished the book, and he moved here, and his intention was to move here for years to figure it out, and he never did. - And that's what keeps a - Definitely keeps about but it keeps 10 million because they're going, &quot;I want to sample a Mardi Gras Indian. I wanna sample Mardi Gras. I wanna sample Jazz Fest.&quot; And when they come in for Jazz Fest, which takes place right they come in and sample something. They might go to the Quarter for a night. They might go to... They'll touch on it And then they're gone for a few years. But then that's their version of the city and very little chance that they're gonna walk or walk into some of these neighborhoods or meet some of these characters, and yeah, there's quite a lot of 'em. - Yeah, lemme put this down 'cause I wanna shake Christopher, that was awesome. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. - No way I would've gotten that on my own, and I'm gonna have a lot to think about. My head hurts a little bit. I took in a lot of information today, so. - There's certain things - Yeah, fact, all right. - Thank you for doing this, too, and giving it a fair shot. - Guys, this is part of a actually only Southern Louisiana. I was out in Cajun country and now here so would love you to see those videos. I'll have those down below somewhere, and also the businesses Thanks for coming along on that journey. Until the next one. (rejoicing music continues) (rejoicing music continues)
