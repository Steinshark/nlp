CELINE: Here we have five female pro footballers. CELINE: At least, that's what our guest Billy thinks. CELINE: The truth is, only one of them is a real pro. CELINE: And she plays for the Belgian national team. CELINE: Billy gets five rounds to guess who's the real pro. CELINE: Meanwhile, we are sitting next to him to maybe distract him. BILLY: These are the stupidest questions! CELINE: Can he make it? Let's see. CELINE: So let's go. CELINE: Today we are playing guess the pro female footballer. CELINE: I know who it is. Michiel knows. CELINE: Abel knows. CELINE: But Billy has no clue at all. BILLY: Yes, can I just say, I didn't need to be blindfolded all the way from the UK. BILLY: It wasn't necessary. MICHIEL: I think it's time for the girls to come in. CELINE: - Yes, let's go. MICHIEL: - 3, 2, 1... CELINE: - Hey! BILLY: I felt like a hostage there. BILLY: - Hi girls. MICHIEL: - This is Billy. BILLY: Ahh! MICHIEL: No talking. BILLY: Why is number one wearing a different kit? MICHIEL: She's a goalkeeper. MICHIEL: - It's not a different kit, it's a goalkeeper kit. MICHIEL: That's disrespect to the Belgium national team. MICHIEL: Before we start officially, they will show you their football teams. MICHIEL: 3, 2, 1... ABEL: The variety. BILLY: Okay, that's actually giving me more of a clue than I think. BILLY: My first question is, are you the pro? BILLY: - We could have an early lunch. BILLY: I would have bought you whatever you guys want, the steak or whatever. ABEL: That's one question gone, by the way. CELINE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. *BILLY HAS 4 QUESTIONS EVERY ROUND* BILLY: Number 1. BILLY: Did you struggle being a goalkeeper that isn't that tall when you were younger? MICHIEL: Yeah, we need to say her English is not that good. She's from France. BILLY: - My French is not good, so... BILLY: Number 2, did you fly over specifically for this shoot? MICHIEL: You know what passes there? MICHIEL: You asked "a flight." MICHIEL: That was a... No, no, no. MICHIEL: One more question left. MICHIEL: - It's not looking good. BILLY: - Oh no... CELINE: This... BILLY: Q2, no flight. BILLY: Number 3. BILLY: Do you play in an attacking role for your club side? BILLY: Let's see what your shooting's like then. BILLY: How many more questions have I got? MICHIEL: That's all the questions for round one. BILLY: What?! MICHIEL: But the most important thing now, Billy, football challenge. BILLY: Well, this is it. CELINE: - Okay, let's go. BILLY: Number 3, I like how clean your boots are. BILLY: 3, clean boots. BILLY: PSG number 1, good luck. MICHIEL: But they are not warmed up. BILLY: Even if they don't hit it, I'm looking at the technique. MICHIEL: - Oh, look at that. Look at that. MICHIEL: - Good one! BILLY: I don't care about the crossbars. MICHIEL: Now we have number three. ABEL: The one with the Nike contract. MICHIEL: They can also play, right? CELINE: - Yeah, yeah, yeah. BILLY: - Number 3... cheating. MICHIEL: - You have 1 attempt for the crossbar after this. BILLY: Good technique. But there was one thing that I wasn't too sure about. CELINE: Hand on... BILLY: - Before she shot, she was like this. MICHIEL: But maybe she's a fan of you and she's a bit shy. MICHIEL: Stop laughing, please. MICHIEL: She's laughing the whole time. BILLY: Number 5, good luck. MICHIEL: - You know what? She was the only one looking at the crossbar. MICHIEL: Billy, it's your turn. BILLY: Okay. CELINE: - Come on, Billy. CELINE: That was close. CELINE: Number 6, good shot. BILLY: That was number 6. BILLY: &quot;HELP!&quot; BILLY: This is a tough decision for me. BILLY: The reason for me choosing this player, based on purely the crossbar shot. BILLY: Number 3, you are not the professional football player. BILLY: So I am voting out the striker of Sosa Waterloo. BILLY: Thank you so much. Thank you. ABEL: -You're confident, Billy, about #3? BILLY: If I tell the truth, if I tell the truth, that doesn't give you much. CELINE: New rounds. New questions. New challenges. CELINE: Let's go, Billy. BILLY: - Okay. BILLY: Have you ever had any abuse on social media for being a pro footballer? BILLY: Or from fans from other teams? MICHIEL: Yes or no. BILLY: #5 smiled when I said that. BILLY: Do you get more than... BILLY: 500 people watching you per game? MICHIEL: - Ooh. BILLY: Okay. BILLY: Oh, you're not giving me much here. BILLY: Do you eat a meal two and a half hours before a game? BILLY: - You hungry females. BILLY: Have you trained here before? BILLY: Yes! I've got a no. BILLY: And you do know this is the international training center for Belgium, right? MICHIEL: Of the men's team. BILLY: - Really? BILLY: - But why would they say yes? BILLY: - They have to tell the truth. BILLY: Wait, what? How can I win this? &quot;HELP&quot; MICHIEL: The only truth for you is the football challenge. MICHIEL: So maybe this route, we go straight to the football. BILLY: I want to see your favorite... skill or trick. ABEL: - Oh, she's feeling which ball. ABEL: - That's a true freestyler. CELINE: You see that? BILLY: - But the laces, the laces gives it away. BILLY: Oh, that's good skills. Hey, hey, hey. MICHIEL: - Now, Billy for a goalkeeper... BILLY: I like it! BILLY: Good luck, #2. BILLY: Comfortable, very comfortable. ABEL: Around the world. That was a good one. GIRL 4: I don't know what to do. MICHIEL: - Oh, she's talking. ABEL: Maybe she has so many. CELINE: You see the technique. MICHIEL: - Oh. ABEL: Look at the... keepy-ups. MICHIEL: She's a, she's a player. MICHIEL: - She can go for 10 hours. MICHIEL: She's smiling while she's doing it. BILLY: I like it. MICHIEL: - #5, she's always smiling. MICHIEL: Yeah, look. ABEL: - Did that round tell you anything? MICHIEL: It's time to choose who is going out. BILLY: You've done amazing, but I don't think... the pro footballer... is Paris Saint-Germain #1. BILLY: Thank you so much. Thank you so much. CELINE: - Bye, #1! GIRL 1: &quot;Au revoir&quot; ABEL: Billy, I might think you made a mistake there. MICHIEL: But it's over. It's over. ABEL: - Yeah. MICHIEL: She's gone. She's gone. MICHIEL: Oh, she did a nutmeg. ABEL: - Saw it. MICHIEL: Sit down. MICHIEL: You gotta sit down. BILLY: That was a key bit of information that I needed. *NUTMEGGED* MICHIEL: 3 left. And maybe Billy, I have a good one for this. MICHIEL: They can answer your questions with one word. BILLY: And I can ask three different questions, right? To each person. MICHIEL: - Yeah, you even have four. BILLY: #5, how many caps have you had for the Belgian national side? GIRL 5: - &quot;Five teen&quot; &quot;Five teen&quot; MICHIEL: Fifteen, fifteen. BILLY: I didn't understand that. BILLY: &quot;Five teen&quot; MICHIEL: How many interlands did you play for England? BILLY: - Pardon? BILLY: - Zero. BILLY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. BILLY: - No, I had a toe injury. BILLY: - It's the little toe. BILLY: It's never recovered. MICHIEL: But even that one's big for me. BILLY: - Yeah, you don't have little toes. CELINE: - Trust me, they're like this. MICHIEL: - She's talking about my toe. BILLY: #4, have you ever scored an international goal? BILLY: #2, where are Leicester in the league so far? GIRL 2: Third. BILLY: - Can I go to Google and have a... BILLY: That was quick. BILLY: - This is really... I've got one more question. ABEL: Good questions though. CELINE: - Yeah, yeah, yeah. CELINE: You're getting better and better, Billy. BILLY: I'm not, I'm really not. BILLY: - You guys, comment down what you would ask in the comment section below. BILLY: Last night I asked AI what questions should I ask. BILLY: And it was like the worst questions in the world. BILLY: Have you ever scored a touchdown in a professional game? BILLY: If I do a bottle flip, you can ask a question. MICHIEL: At what age did you make your debut for the first team? GIRL 2: - 20. CELINE: - Yeah, this is the bad one. ABEL: - Did you throw that away. CELINE: - Yeah! BILLY: These will be my numbers on the lotto. BILLY: Name your league you play in. GIRL 2: - Premier league. GIRL 2: For the women... oh! MICHIEL: - Oh, she... MICHIEL: She is harsh. CELINE: - #5 is... on fire. BILLY: - #4? MICHIEL: - That was convincing. MICHIEL: What challenge do you want to do? BILLY: I think it should be a penalty challenge. CELINE: And we have a goalkeeper. Number 1! BILLY: - Can we bring the goalkeeper? ABEL: - Oh, the run up... CELINE: - That's a banger. BILLY: I like it. MICHIEL: - For her it's too easy, like no effort. CELINE: #5. BILLY: - The little spin on the ball. ABEL: - That was the best one, Billy. BILLY: Well... Well you all put the ball in exactly the same corner, exact same spot. BILLY: I get nothing from that. MICHIEL: - And what about the goalkeeper? BILLY: Great effort, great effort, but... BILLY: Maybe, Billy, because it's so hard, you can do like one more football challenge. MICHIEL: - If Celine agrees. BILLY: Maybe I... kick the ball up. MICHIEL: - And they need to touch it. ABEL: - Test the touch. CELINE: - Yeah, yeah. CELINE: Oh, oh, that's high. CELINE: - Ohh... MICHIEL: Oh, she went for a crossbar. BILLY: - You ready? GIRL 4: - Yes. BILLY: Pros are disciplined. They would never say yes. BILLY: - You ready? BILLY: Again. MICHIEL: You're throwing higher. MICHIEL: That was close. BILLY: The only problem is... the knee. MICHIEL: Do some KDB passes from there and they need to touch it. BILLY: - Yeah, yeah, yeah. CELINE: Come on. MICHIEL: Oh, good ball. CELINE: - Good, #2! Let's go! MICHIEL: With the chest! MICHIEL: - Okay. MICHIEL: Oh, good ball. MICHIEL: She... ABEL: - She had it though. MICHIEL: Give one to me. One to me. MICHIEL: They call me Peter Crouch from Belgium. ABEL: Wait, Billy, Billy. One to me, one to me. Please, please. ABEL: They call me Hakim Ziyech. BILLY: - Celine, you up next. MICHIEL: Let's go, Abel. MICHIEL &amp; ABEL: Celine, Celine! MICHIEL: No pressure, no pressure. CELINE: They call me Boniface. ABEL: What was that? CELINE: Crossbar! BILLY: Crossbar challenge complete. BILLY: There's some good touches there. BILLY: They're all a very similar standard. BILLY: You guys have got good players here. CELINE: True. Sorry for the bad cross. BILLY: Sorry for the bad cross before that. CELINE: Can I do one more question? CELINE: Because I love you, you can. MICHIEL: Okay... Thank you very much. BILLY: See what I mean. Like the video for that. MICHIEL: I love you too. MICHIEL: What's the most... She just gave a thumb up. MICHIEL: What's the most important game you played in your life? MICHIEL: Like Champions League final. GIRL 2: My debut. MICHIEL: - That's beautiful, right? BILLY: You were so focused as well. BILLY: I don't know... You are like there staring and you have the stick and you just do things. GIRL 4: Qualification game for the Euros. MICHIEL: And that's with the national team! MICHIEL: - For you? BILLY: There was a stumble in the delivery again. BILLY: Maybe you can ask one more. BILLY: - Yeah, yeah. BILLY: Who's the best player you've ever played with or against? GIRL 2: Lieke Martens. ABEL: Do you know her? GIRL 4: - Lauren James. BILLY: This number now is my biggest problem. BILLY: - Pro...blem. MICHIEL: But problem starts with? ABEL: - P. MICHIEL: With &quot;P.&quot; *MICHIEL GIVING INFO ABOUT #4* *CELINE IS FUMING* BILLY: #4, you had an injury on your knee. BILLY: What happened? GIRL 4: ACL. BILLY: - Can I see the scar? BILLY: - Can I ask... BILLY: ...to check the Women's Premier League table? ABEL: - I'll give it to you. MICHIEL: Oh, this is for her a very exciting moment. BILLY: - Where are Leicester in the league so far? BILLY: There's two reasons now. BILLY: I'm so sorry, #2... because you've got outstanding ability. BILLY: However, the facts don't lie. BILLY: So I feel like I am going to say: #2, you are not the pro footballer. BILLY: Well done. Thank you very much. Thank you. CELINE: Thank you, number two. ALL: - Oh... CELINE: We have a final. ABEL: Michiel, you have been helping Billy a lot. ABEL: - We're going to switch. MICHIEL: Abel is a big fan of Billy and he just wants to sit here. CELINE: Yeah, maybe that's true. BILLY: You've got to replace Michiel now and give me some sort of... CELINE: Abel... BILLY: First question to each lady is which position do you play? GIRL 4: - 6 or 8. BILLY: I don't want them to hear the question. MICHIEL: - OK, yeah. MICHIEL: - Okay, yeah. MICHIEL: - What's the question? GIRL 5: &quot;Five teen&quot; BILLY: Which stadium did you make your debut for your national side? GIRL 5: - Johan Cruijff Arena. BILLY: It wasn't so much to know the stadium, it was to see the pause in them thinking. ABEL: Can I ask a question? But then it's gone, so... BILLY: Please do. ABEL: - How many questions will you still have? ABEL: - I have a free question? ABEL: - No, I want to replace the question. CELINE: - I have a good question. MICHIEL: Celine also... Maybe we all ask one question and then it's over. ABEL: - Okay, I'm fine with that. BILLY: - Sounds good to me. MICHIEL: First for you. MICHIEL: What's the name of your coach... in your football team? GIRL 4: Stephane Guidi. MICHIEL: - And for you? BILLY: - Yeah, that doesn't help me. CELINE: How are you? GIRL 4: - Fine! ABEL: Cline, Celine, I like that, I like that, I like that. MICHIEL: That's the questions we want. BILLY: Great question. ABEL: - My question? ABEL: - Are you happy when you play football? BILLY: These are the stupidest questions! ABEL: Yeah, they're happy. BILLY: After you finish an international match, can you give the shirts away? GIRL 5: Sometimes. GIRL 4: We have two shirts, 1 you can swap and 1 you keep. BILLY: Can you elaborate on &quot;sometimes&quot;? GIRL 5: In a friendly game, we can, but otherwise not. MICHIEL: - But we have 1... No, 2 football challenges left. BILLY: - Yes, we do. ABEL: Let's go. GIRL 4: I still have training in the afternoon, so... MICHIEL: - She has training! BILLY: She said, &quot;What?&quot; * 2-TOUCH CHALLENGE* MICHIEL: Billy thought it was over, but it's not. BILLY: Wow, they're good. BILLY: This is good, the starting is good. MICHIEL: Oh, I like that. MICHIEL: She doesn't want to lose! BILLY: 2-0. ABEL: - That was... ABEL: - 2-1, 2-1, 2-1, 2-1. MICHIEL: - Don't kill each other, okay? BILLY: I'm liking what I'm seeing. CELINE: Number 5! BILLY: This next challenge, I'm going to be in goal. BILLY: I'm going to pass the ball into you really fast. BILLY: One touch... shot. BILLY: So then I get to see the touch and the finish. ABEL: - Billy, what's the goalkeeping? MICHIEL: She's not saying anything. MICHIEL: Let's go. MICHIEL: Left and right. CELINE: - Left and right, very good. CELINE: - Come, #5. BILLY: Sharpshooter, touch finish. CELINE: Striker. BILLY: She's just finishing. BILLY: I got a little bit from that, even though I've seen... BILLY: ...their control is excellent. BILLY: The standard is so high. MICHIEL: - But now. CELINE: - The big final! BILLY: Sorry, guys. ABEL: - Everything is gone. BILLY: That's cheating. BILLY: This is the moment I've come to a decision and I believe the pro is... BILLY: Number 4! MICHIEL: - This is some awkward silence. BILLY: It was 50-50. ABEL: - 5 is not happy. CELINE: Thank you, #5! CELINE: And at this moment, it was time for all the players to come back for the big reveal. CELINE: Who will step forward as the mystery pro? CELINE: Who plays for the Belgian national team? CELINE: Let's find out. BILLY: OK, so it's time to reveal who the real pro is. BILLY: The real pro can step forward now. BILLY: No, no, no. Don't be doing this to me. MICHIEL: She's the real pro. WATCH YOUR EARS IN: BILLY: Come on! BILLY: It was so close. CELINE: - You did it. BILLY: I can't believe that I actually, yeah. BILLY: So what I want to know is what is the forfeit for Celine?! MICHIEL: Everyone can kick a ball at Celine at the same time. CELINE: Oh, number 5! MICHIEL: One more question. MICHIEL: Can you all tell Billy if you ever played football? MICHIEL: And if yes, for what team? GIRL 1: My last team where I played was RWD Morlenbeek. MICHIEL: - Are you a goalkeeper? GIRL 2: I played FC Eindhoven. MICHIEL: - That's second division in the Netherlands? GIRL 3: I actually never played football. GIRL 4: I am full-time pro in Standard. MICHIEL: - And she plays for the national team of Belgium. GIRL 5: I play also for FC Eindhoven. CELINE: - That's it. BILLY: Amazing! BILLY: Okay. Hold on, Celine. CELINE: Thank you, Billy. BILLY: Who's aiming for me? *NUMBER 5 POINTING AT BILLY* BILLY: I heard that. MICHIEL: She said, &quot;We're all aiming at him.&quot; MICHIEL: 3... 2... 1... MICHIEL: That was personal! CELINE: That was hard, that was hard. BILLY: - That was personal. GIRL 4: Sorry. I got you both at the same time. GIRL 4: It was between you two. BILLY: Oh, that's the one that come off the... BILLY: Two... two for one. BILLY: The pro got two for one. SUBSCRIBE!!! :-) MICHIEL: We are now the day before the shoot with Billy. CELINE: - And look. MICHIEL: Shari. CELINE: Let's go.
