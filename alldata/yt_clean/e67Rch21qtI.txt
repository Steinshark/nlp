Using aircraft to battleship guns at distances over 10 miles, Such a revelation swiftly reshaped naval all 18 battleships with catapults capable with floats. Simultaneously, floatplanes serving mainly as eyes in the sky that scouted Initially, both battleships and cruisers shared the Vought UOs and O2Us. As the 1930s dawned and the requirements for floatplanes evolved. tailored distinct specifications: battleships and a new breed of floatplanes: Thus, following the adoption of the Curtiss another requirement to equip the rest of the aircraft with either floats or wheels, a weight a wingspan with a limit of 36 feet, and catapult at a speed of 60 miles per hour. to be stored on hangars with limited space, and feature good cockpit visibility for the as part of its artillery-spotting role. to conduct long-range operations and search In 1936, the Naval Bureau of Aeronautics Aircraft a contract to build a single biplane was designing an aircraft that could meet the catapult launch while still carrying sufficient Nonetheless, work on the design progressed, and Vought tested the waters with the XOSU-1 featuring new flaps for heavier takeoffs. significantly outperform its predecessors, Maryland. Not long after, the company aluminum-skinned biplane equipped with advanced While it boasted a 40% improvement in range, its SOC-1 Seagull despite sharing the same engine. the Navy commissioned a new prototype Led by designer Rex Beisel, the Vought team design that saved valuable weight and fuel Pratt &amp; Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior engine. competitors in every flight category, including less wing area, 22% less horsepower, and 15% takeoff speed of 55.6 miles per hour. innovative broad chord wing design, featuring enhanced slow flight capabilities, wing surfaces for improved roll control. first American military aircraft to incorporate This new structural technique would become leading to the iconic XF4U-1 Corsair prototype. structural modifications, including adding and a subtle step enhancement to aerodynamic profile and float stability. design contract, beginning with an order with its unique amphibious capabilities, was Between 1939 and 1942, over 1,500 Kingfishers cornerstone of naval aviation. The most produced a thousand units and an additional three hundred designation OS2N. This production strategy allowed production of the critically needed F4U Corsair. around one hundred would be delivered to the innovative fighters making their way to The Kingfisher remained the cornerstone of Navy only beginning to be phased out in favor Throughout its service, the Kingfisher spawned modifications.
