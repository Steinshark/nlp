Sleep and Study. Don't Good evening. Well, we have chosen a particularly difficult, but that has years. When we - well, Sara a little studying astronomy, there was nothing but stars in space. And and they would tell us everything, and, study. What seems important to us - this is such a small addition to the like a pinch of salt, yes, the situation has changed dramatically, cosmos with horror. Two thirds, or even three quarters are not is, under the conventional name of &quot;dark property of antigravity, a fantastic thing, in nature. Nobody will tell you anything about it, movement of galaxies. There's another quarter of the population We possess some knowledge regarding it. overarching principles of physics. Our while we are aware that dark matter is an mysterious nature stems from the fact detect it, yet it is perceivable in the these enigmatic particles for over fifty the typical characteristics of gravity, have yet to unveil their other properties study them using laboratory instruments, actively engaged But this does not annoy us much. We'll find Well, it would the population of space, although five energy and mass, but at least we know electrons, something we experienced scientists. But it turns out it's mostly see, even the coolest telescopes can't between galaxies. And there's only of the universe. Five percent, that's universe. You could and say that stars aren't worth studying Nevertheless, when we look up at the sky, And a telescope looking at the sky also want to or not, we have to study the there are practically no other sources about the evolution of matter, about evolution of any pinch of salt in the Well, in and of themselves, they're physics to understand what's going on eye, we see stars. Somebody may say, telescope, take it in your hands, and Universe. We take we see more stars, but we don't And if we try really hard, even more stars. This is the world's biggest this. A tiny patch photographed by a telescope just a little meters in diameter, well, that's about has a mirror like this. Nothing but stars again. So you can't basis of stars after all. And, as it turns born in the not so distant past, are born Universe for quite a long time. So, first they come from, how they are formed, beautiful natural thermonuclear that make the motion movement of matter in the world. This is, in fact, the only source of energy the only one - it is starlight. We have of us. Very old ones, over ten billion years Our Sun, like many other stars, is a teenagers or youngsters. It is still in inside a protective cocoon of matter. In origins of stars and the fascinating our discussion will be dedicated to the intricate journey we think we've understood so far. And evolve and what they turn into So there's a theoretical Physicists have long thought about how since something gives off energy, heat, there's never an infinite amount realized that they had to figure out And quite a long time ago they discovered, then we realized dust, small solid background of a hot gas cloud. At Teachers referred to them as nebulae, as often exhibiting a highly intricate our attention. However, over time, we explanation for the birth of stars. This into denser entities of colossal mass. We witness it during every solar eclipse, Sun. A mere glimpse at the solar corona gradually lose a portion of their individual stars intermingle, resulting wind. Eventually, exceedingly rarefied expanse. When observing a visual solar corona comprises rarefied gas. appears as if one could simply cut through the ultra-high vacuum scientists laboratories, referred to as the ultra-high reason that it is highly improbable we more rarefied medium. Its density aligns corona, with approximately one billion Well, chemists and physicists realize because we have billions of billions of billions of billions of atoms right now, this cubic centimeter, and it's very billion atoms in a And for nature, it's a very tangible neighborhood of the star, it becomes disappear completely Stars are formed from matter that is matter, it doesn't have a significant plays a role in the The Sum will lose about a tenth of a percent an insignificant amount. But at the end of its This particular picture displays a violent behavior of this star. At one A star that resembles our Sun is almost star is older, with an age of around ten five billion years. As it nears the end small core that contains approximately half of the star's mass is rapidly lost spewing it out intensely in all directions. talk about the evolution of stars, we phenomenon. Now, as you can see, half back back into space, back into the interstellar planetary nebulae. It's an unfortunate astronomers didn't have good telescopes. a poor telescope, you see some kind of something, something it resembles the disk a planetary nebula, it's not a the last stages of It looks very beautiful in the modern Telescope gets, and for that and we're very grateful for that. On the one but, unfortunately, no, I'm kidding, not these planetary nebulae cannot yet be explained. can't understand how a spherical star, all ball stars, you look same on all sides. How do they organize in space around Today, you will also have the opportunity nebulae. These celestial phenomena shapes. It is perplexing to contemplate smooth as a billiard ball, can expel others. Moreover, you will encounter nebulae. Fortunately for aspiring phenomena remains enigmatic, allowing for This gas is gradually filling and more and more of it is being added, say. Here we have before us the well-known constellation of Orion, of gas in which stars are forming before brightest star, Betelgeuse, maybe not, in the next hundred thousand years in the realm of astronomy, the event we on the various ways stars can discharge matter in which new stars can emerge, expelled by the Sun and its celestial would be insufficient. We require a more during the demise of Take a moment to observe the substantial expanse between the stars. It appears doesn't it? However, this perception photography technique. By placing a light the light emitted from the gas is accentuated stars is deliberately diminished. In saturated with gas. Through this process, fiercely diffused medium can eventually known as stars. You see, the majority of its high temperature and radiation, tremendous heat is acquired as the gas is surface of a star, and subsequently it gradually and as it cools, it starts there are no solid walls in space, there enclosed. If some region of interstellar decreased, and the surrounding hot dense it. It gets compressed and becomes more dark, dense, seemingly invisible clouds. Here are the tiny ones here, here are the Here we have a hot gas, and here we actually much more massive than all the denser. Interstellar gas possesses a remarkable When we compress gas by using a hand everyone knows how to do it. This process, in our hand. Why? We compress the gas and increase And interstellar gas, although it's also more you compress it, the To cool down, the gas particles have to electrons to higher levels, and they dump radiation. So, by compressing the gas, you cool down a little bit. And once it cools even easier to compress further. It's interstellar medium. Studying interstellar gas presents a temperature high enough to emit visible invisible to optical instruments. detected by other devices. The majority hydrogen, which accounts for ninety helium makes up ten percent of the gas, very small quantities. Hydrogen, consisting the primary component of interstellar electron have a magnetic moment, resembling oriented in either a parallel or When they are oriented parallel, the we know, magnets repel when they have the when they're antiparallel, the energy of So the skipping of the electron, the its magnetic axis from one side to to release excess energy, it takes the a radio wave. These waves have a length fortunate circumstance allows us to The composition of this gas is primarily percent regardless of its temperature. gas to be cold and not ionized, existing have been crucial tools since the early interstellar medium. Nonetheless, there purpose. Before you, there are four complete of the entire celestial sky. Similar to these unfolded maps portray Each of them is obtained in a certain telescope took us, photographed the whole veins on it say that here cold gas on the this is exactly the same line, twenty-one frequency written on it. The In our terminology, hydrogen that and and H-two is And as you can see, along the band of cold interstellar gas. And this is hotter the plane of the galaxy, it too is compressed the plane of the galaxy. And this is monoxide. But this is a more complex particularly complex. This is a very regions of the interstellar medium. And Way. In short, the medium from which, as pressed against the plane of the galaxy to the center, to the potential pit, as gravity of our stellar system. That's into separate fragments. Here's another galaxy is actually is flat, but in this wide-angle shot, You can see it. And we the dark veins, previously known as backdrop of stars. Hence, interstellar absorbs light from distant sources. The light-absorbing properties. Consequently, our visual perception. However, if a dusty coal dust particles would obstruct our Even a mere few grams of dust would is similar to what occurs in the solid particles which we commonly minuscule in size. In terms of mass, they of the interstellar medium. Nonetheless, them. As a result, these particles and central plane of the galaxy. of the stars behind where the interstellar dust is so densely at all in the optical range. And, of of the nineteenth century, found it difficult nothing could be seen, where new generations of stars are born. can you even understand what's going on infrared telescopes, radio telescopes, translucent or completely transparent, we and see that it is there Until 19th century the process of star formation was not century there were heated debates, are born. Maybe some of you remember Ambartsumyan. No, you don't, do you? It's he graduated from the university, he Leningrad, yes, he graduated from Leningrad Armenian astronomical school, the creator very good mathematician, and he had his stars from superdense matter of mysterious long time, we explained to him that nature he stood his ground, partly to highlight, to create, but partly because we did not how to understand that in these cold clouds, a horse's head, it is so called, the going on there? Little by little we figured it out. medium is not homogeneous, that there temperature and density, the chemical Astronomers today distinguish three characteristic Cold. Since the temperature is low, molecules they tend to dissociate easily at high typically destroyed under such temperatures, these molecules are preserved. the form of the H2 molecule, which molecular clouds. Additionally, there atomic hydrogen. Physicists sometimes spectroscopists and chemists prefer represents a medium consisting solely of moderate temperatures, where the molecules retain their individuality. They possess nature. Finally, we come across a hot hydrogen. This means that the electron exist independently of each other. In this of hydrogen. It's quite And here, just off the screen, there is cloud with its rays. The intense heat subsequently loses its molecular form gradually approaches the star, it reaches thousand Kelvin. Electrons disengage ionized. Consequently, all three types Which one of them, of these hydrogen types, is mostly The one where it's coldest. By the way, where it's coldest, it's interstellar medium is most complex. optical telescopes, and then with radio centimeter, millimeter, we began to discover hydrogen. You see, this is the very widely represented molecules in the two hundred different molecules. have up to thirteen atoms in them. Well, them are even amino acids. And biologists, concerned about the search that the first steps to the evolution planets, but in the interstellar medium. protobiological molecules. Some amino carbon complexes, and so on. It is in molecules form that stars are It's always a big to create molecules from the same atoms. or hydrogen and oxygen, molecules are important for the further formation of put two atoms of hydrogen into a hydrogen molecule is very difficult to combine? You can bring them together. The atoms fly they have to come together. That is, they have to shed and then they're and then they'll bond But how do you if they're the same? Well, identical atoms, roughly speaking, They're the same. They're arguing over excess energy. When there are different solve this problem. So the role of the chemical reaction, is played by these they're important. Just like in an exhaust pipe, and it plays a very important decent gas. The hydrogen atom sticks to a speck of dust. I've drawn aggregate with needles, with an uneven in search of the most convenient place some protrusions, where the electric waits. Waiting for what? For another atom the speck of dust, and eventually, they'll meet and they'll and come into contact. And then their the dust particle itself. It'll get a it'll emit in the infrared. And they will be they will even jump back, push off due connection, and fly in free flight, leave form of a molecule. That's very atoms Atoms cannot radiate energy, but molecules moves from one energy level to another, the levels. If the atom is at a lower lower level without jumping or emitting numerous ways to alter its energy. It can as its atoms move relative to each other, the form of very low-energy quanta. effective refrigerator within the within it, the cooling process continues, The person who with formulas in his hands, the process of star formation, it was Jeans. He did a lot of things in physics, first to look at such a process. There gravity, and they want to be attracted and they want to fly freely and fly away I'm going to show you If you don't like physics, don't pay makes sense. In this scenario, a gas cloud faces pressure. Gravity attempts to compress liquefy it and render it invisible. Both for dominance, subjecting the The one who works faster Either gravity will cause it to compress cause it to disperse more quickly. The speed of sound is the speed of contraction is related to attraction formulas and got two critical parameters, of the gas cloud, and the symbol J is Jeans, which tell us that that a big cloud, massive, will be massive, will be defeated by gas pressure, critical parameter. And for the interstellar of a light-year or a parsec, as we like fraction of a solar mass is the critical destined to be stars, they can't compress clouds have such strong gravity But you see it all depends on parameters, interstellar gas. What was known at the the twentieth century, about one thousand twenty-third year. Back in the time of Jeans, optical telescopes We were able to see brightly glowing still wanted to understand more about twentieth century, we discovered that around ten thousand kelvin and very low formula, we found that the critical clouds was gigantic, equivalent to hundreds was perplexing because stars of that size of galaxies. Something seemed off the birth of stars. These monstrous masses Several years later, in the mid-fifties, uncovered another portion of the Here, the gas had temperatures in the colder than before, and the density was calculated masses around 20 solar masses. such masses in nature, it was a significant masses were becoming more plausible. A ultraviolet telescopes into space. They hot interstellar medium, with temperatures Although it was extremely rarified, this equivalent to that of an entire galaxy. previous observations either. Ultimately, later, long after Jeans and his contemporaries myself included as a graduate of the coldest component of the interstellar It with its crazy low temperature, ten sixty-three Celsius, the really terrible standards of cosmic density of a thousand very much considered. Substitute that and you get four solar they are, five solar masses, two solar us. Well, finally, Jeans' formulae have born. It is the coldest, absolutely still felt by other instruments, cold medium, that is it and is the birthplace the stars of new generations. It turns or molecular clouds scale. In our galaxy, there are only There are roughly five thousand immense molecular clouds. However, observe for which approaches approximately one million within our solar system, no other or almost none, there's two Is it like &quot;Pillars Those would be The whole thing as a whole is about, yeah, is huge, twenty pairs of seconds, a these are monsters we never knew existed telescopes have finally allowed us to stars must be born. Now we A cold big cloud, as the pressure in it drops as it does so, the pressure of the surrounding gas, thickens and cools more and more, but homogeneity in nature. Some part of this other, and separate dense The rate at which they shrink surpasses their higher density, resulting in stronger within the colossal cloud experiences gravity, the gas within it gradually heats it endeavors to cool itself by emitting as it becomes increasingly opaque, the hindered, disrupting the cooling process heat up. The compression persists, causing enough, it reaches temperatures of that's the beginning the beginning of thermonuclear reactions. happens in an instant, there it starts because the density is high, the thermonuclear reactions are going on. surrounding outer part of the cloud is continues to fall there to the center central region turns into a star, and the construction debris left over from the somewhere. And as we can see now, not just goes into orbit around our newly formed drawn towards one another, resulting in gravitational attraction between these merge together and progressively acquire of orbiting serves as the driving force occur amongst these Has anyone ever collided with You get bumped, you get spun around speed up the process, because remember slowly at first, but then she pulls her and the angular velocity The conservation of momentum causes the well. Initially, the peripheral matter time goes on, it unwinds more and more, central, already young star. This matter birth to a gas disk around the star. eventually form. A process no less mysterious than the less clear to us than the birth of the stars How did we manage to see everything? debate, through the creation of a instruments are called millimeter and discussing the observation of molecules, radiation. And for this purpose, we short-wave, millimeter-wave, Electronics mastered the art of generating advent of satellite television. Various satellite, FM, and even shorter radio and Eventually, radio astronomers captured receivers, leading to the creation of most essential is a system of radio northern part of the Andes, on the peak five kilometers high, this system radio telescope or radio It's a magnificent instrument. This is moonlight. Sixty-plus antennas working space and accumulating light, not light, even say. It's something between light such a peculiar range. But it's exactly interstellar light. And he showed us something in our imaginations, but now we can see gas protoplanetary disk around it. Even planets have already formed here and dust, from molecules of gas, which themselves and have already cleared the this instrument came along, it is a very the collective money of We did not participate in it. Well, there's rather sad. It is a very expensive thing and very five kilometers, regular scientists serviced mainly by locals from Chile, from used to the thin air since childhood, while at the level of four kilometers, and In theory, we can consider this process simulated on computers. As the star thermonuclear reaction. This leads to disk around it. Although the disk continuously process remains intact, but the radiation from the star itself heats up the gas and tries to push it where does it want to push off to? equatorial region of the disk. It's dense cold, it holds. And along the axis of space. And very often a young star forms other one upwards. It has two tops. And it ejects the excess form of such diametrically opposed streams, left over that's not ejected, it all eventually Fantasy? Not at all. We are presently of us lies a frigid molecular cloud. this location. Although we are able to unseen through an optical telescope. protoplanetary disk and it's got hot gas traveling in two into the interior of the cloud, we can't opaque. But here, this stream broke space, and we saw it. Here it is directed angle. Well, we see high-speed, a rarefied gas. That's where the shock wave shot out, and we realize that a new star one. A star right here. One stream is coming away from us into the interior it's only visible in radio. That's where one comes out. And even, look, you can see for engineers. It's what we use in to the knife. It's an Archimedes screw. reason, because there are also magnetic accelerating this gas. And they are so their rotation they help the gas to fly theory. Although the appearance of this magnetic acceleration of gas. It's very telescope for helping There are various regions close to us forming. Interestingly, we have discovered existence individually. We can observe a that only a single star has formed. together, side by side. Although it may least once, over a short period of time, years. Some of this phenomenon can be seen image captured using both optical and we can observe four extremely hot and These massive stars were born approximately such intense light that they are visible rest of the objects would be invisible in the optics, but in can see them as newly formed clouds there star is not quite born yet. It's already source, but it's still shrinking. This It's only visible in the infrared. Look remnants, so to speak, of the gas that structure of the star. They just accelerate projectiles, penetrating the cloud, flying This shows that the young stars are trying excess matter, heating up the surrounding effect, destroying The formation of their own interior was amount of time had passed. Look, here's another example. A massive the hottest stars, has blown a bubble like this around itself. it's emptied the space of gas. And it's keeps pushing its native cloud, which It's pushing it around and There are some very massive stars. There's one it's so turbulent, it's hard to imagine the nineteenth century. has shown us... It was at one time the it threw out has cooled down a bit, the see how actively it, apparently the remnants is scattering There are hundreds of such but they're hard to study. Our solar system resides within the galactic and gas, making it opaque to our view. expanse of the galaxy is impossible as matter. Luckily, neighboring galaxies, convenient and comprehensive field of unfolded images, akin to pictures, on spotted the vast gas cloud, known as neighboring galaxy: the Traditionally the Magellan expedition, discovered it in the sky, now we call neighboring small galaxy, but it's formation. And right here, by the way, ever discovered by astronomers in nature. belongs to a neighboring galaxy, but its our Sun. To be honest, physics can't yet explain and not collapse under the influence of we'll explain it somehow. The important What happens next? The newborn stars In the early stages of a developing exerts pressure, causing the nearby cloud space. Eventually, the most massive stars their lives and explode. However, our Sun experience such an explosion. Over the gradually shed some of its mass, forming dramatic eruption. Consider, for instance, more massive than the Sun. It will take two or three million years, which is and when it reaches the end of its life, matter into space in a sudden outburst. observe them. Around one thousand years fifty-four, people on Earth witnessed shining star in the Taurus constellation. massive star that had exploded. Over material it ejected formed an expanding approximately twelve times the mass of our event of matter release. of a substance that has enormous energy. around two thousand The kinetic energy is insanely large, rarefied, almost invisible here environment, So, the young stars explode, they heat up and you can see the parent cloud gradually away, moving away, and What's left in place of the huge gas cloud their fate? By the way, as now established, our Sun, collective of newborn stars. It never years in the company of other celestial We can see that the stars are still in a very original shot, where you can hardly gas. You can see that such a Barnard loop, and completely left absolutely nothing there. Well, we see that is now flying towards us, here from that is flying perpendicularly there, looking along the There it lies, a youthful cluster of immediately, it became stripped of extra mass which it originally The cloud was huge, massive, a few percent with their energy the cloud was destroyed. gone, and with it went the gravity of that cloud. Suddenly, they found themselves devoid collective's internal gravity proves young collective. Here they are on and they've thrown and they found themselves, moving too fast to stay in this place. to distance from where they were formed. because it closely resembles the evaporation glass of water onto a windowsill, returning the glass remains, and returning another completely dry. Where do the particles sufficient velocity to escape from here room, never to return to the glass. The interact and influence each other distribution of their velocities follows velocity distribution. Consequently, free from this collective at And now, as we observe computer calculations, migrate away from the region where they slower due to random factors and ultimately group. Moreover, there are instances where formation, while others with slower slower-moving celestial bodies concentrate. of young stars eventually venture away while the smaller ones congregate to create of gravity. It is fascinating how you But about two-thirds of the stars that already gone beyond the frame boundaries started traveling around So they're gone, oh well. Our Sun also once But those that moved slowly sometimes smaller ones were destroyed faster, but years, and we see about a hundred of them, and they have not lost their members all members have left this collective moving, moving chaotically. It's My whole scientific career has been devoted They remember in of what was. And here's another globular there shoulder to shoulder, yes, stars, but this is the effect of our atmosphere, seem to us such a teddy, so in fact they without collisions, well, rarely, sometimes rarely. And so, like bees in a swarm, they Surprisingly, stars often exist in residing in pairs or sometimes even groups triple celestial bodies. no commentary. But in the world of stars it is a regular already found out that two thirds of all and about a quarter of them are triple, them are quadruple and even more and more Sun is a single star. The has always been concerned with explaining form. Generally speaking, they can get computer experiment. We took three drawn them here as balls, and threw them closer, they don't collide, but they get each other. And Three random luminaries coming they interacted gravitationally so much second, merged and lived together as a their connection go? And the third star them, at the expense of attraction to this with great speed, carrying away the stars, there's one single star and two But you realize that for two stars to still some possibility. But for a third place at the same moment, the that it could happen, but it's very rare. able to explain the birth of all First, we have to take into account the more If we envision the stars as inflexible billiard balls, then when two celestial force of gravity causes trajectory, and with the same velocity did not connect. that the stars, despite their apparent They are influenced by the forces of attraction. Similar to how the Moon's and creates tides, stars also induce their shapes to change. Through precise soft star approaches a larger, more stretching as it is drawn towards it. their gravitational attraction and is of a trajectory that propels the star elliptical orbit due to this comes back here again, deforms again, revolutions, and it comes out The star eventually settles into a circular a result, they become permanently process holds a higher likelihood since and allow for a third But we're looking at a much more complex Castor. This is the brightest star in the Look what an interesting Two luminaries next to each other, two and this group form a double relative another double system orbits in a wider together in a single system. A chance couldn't help either. How did And the idea came up from the other side. the deformations of bodies that have they cool down. Researchers have explored compression of shapes within an ideal from reality, it allows us to investigate body at its initial stages. With time, increases. This change leads to the body size. The momentum causes the rotating into a spheroid shape. The flattened body occurring along the axis of rotation. process progresses. Then the deformation gradually increases, And at some point, if nothing happens, it more strongly and turns into a pancake of which still remains a single body. But down a different evolutionary line. substance bounced to the periphery, then A ring is also a single body. It's a let's see what's next. And it turns out bifurcation, the separation of evolutionary a slightly deformed ellipsoid could become elongated, as my students And it could rotate around a short axis and slight perspective. The cucumber exhibits stretch out and transform into a pencil interested in this specific aspect. division. If some external force disturbs disperse to the ends of the ellipsoid, this juncture, we begin to perceive a dumbbell-shaped body, which gained Poincare's description. As the connecting matter will migrate towards the dumbbell's two distinct objects. it is possible for the object to break calculations indicate this possibility and to the formation of two distinct objects separate stars. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic shows that it's not just binary, but more Approximately fifteen years ago or so. about to explain. Over time, this concept We observe that the cloud has been within its central region. As the cloud fragments separate from each other. resulting in the formation of a unique nature. As to where this matter will to provide a clear answer due to the However, the primary substance divides to a system of two double structures. center of mass. Through the process of remarkable phenomenon known as fragmentation, subsequent disintegration We do observe such objects in space. artist's picture, but in reality we observe and have not yet lost their mutual preserved. It is unknown, most likely, separate luminaries, but we see such this picture of the artist, but by their of the mutual we realize that Here is a standard model of the Sun, and millions, there from fifteen million the surface of the star and almost to the surface, it is almost... The pressure within a star decreases as the center of the star to be hotter due the matter at the center of the star transfers it to the surface before accepted model of internal parameter with no doubts. However, the question maintains its internal temperature for continuously lose such a substantial noticeable changes? It was not immediately sustaining energy could be. In principle, explain this phenomenon? In the early 19th century, the concept unknown. People generally believed responsible for the energy generated inside a star, such as carbonaceous bind with oxygen, similar to how carbon stove. This process would release energy. long the Sun could shine solely based source. For instance, we could measure kilogram of burned fuel to estimate the possess knowledge about the Sun's mass, unbelievably enormous, close to 10^27 energy released during a chemical potential lifespan. Unfortunately, it reactions alone, the Sun could only sustain several thousand years. A perfect match with the biblical The early nineteenth century scientists greatness, to the point that even the confirmed the validity of the theory. rolled around, geologists began to question solar system being such a young age. sedimentary layers built up at the bottoms estimate that it would take hundreds of to occur. This forced physicists to continued existence of the Sun. They source of energy and turned to gravity. from above and makes impact, it generates gravitational field converts into thermal lifted on a pendulum clock, which then generating energy The clock weight descends and releases its potential energy. acceleration of free fall, on the height released, passes in the end into heat, in of energy is the Sun, massive body, large fall on the Sun. We looked around. And dust in the space between the planets. can just see it. Especially in equatorial the horizon, we see such a faintly luminous the black sky. We call it the the ecliptic, along the zodiacal dust particles that reflect the light of on them. And we're a field disk that's so dust is falling. Dust, meteorites, with their impact. Something seems to be missing here. The insufficient quantity of this substance. physicists, namely Meyer, took the initiative. necessary calculations. what's on the outside? The Sun As the Sun's matter gravitates towards its collapse onto the layers beneath it, continues to shrink and compress in its will continue. And the calculation showed, a simple form, enough not for three thousand, Once again, it's an interesting thought Geologists have estimated that the Earth years old. Meanwhile, astronomers have energy source that allows the Sun to This discovery has put everyone's mind at phenomena. It's worth mentioning that this In the life cycle of any star, there are bestows its luminosity upon them. The where it condenses from a nebula into relentless heat generated only by Similarly, the death of a star entails the energy, causing it to collapse into a its primary source of energy. Nonetheless, required for the star's core existence Thus, a mere thirty million when radioactivity The chemical elements, uranium, plutonium end of the periodic table. At the very twentieth century, radioactivity was of the Earth's rocks, and it turned out billions of years old. So astronomy evolution of the Sun by billions of years. decays, so the Sun something's decaying Well, luckily, they didn't know that a lot the Sun would explode in a heartbeat if needed another idea, and only in the end the Mendeleev table, not to heavy realized that not only decay, but also elements, from hydrogen, helium, from release. These are called thermonuclear physicists could not understand fusion involves bringing chemical, well, nucleus, a hydrogen proton nucleus, in complex nucleus, they just have And these are two protons, two positively they repel as homonymously charged particles. they repel. So to bring them closer high speed. This idea is realized when we accelerate gas pedal, but there's no gas pedal in the interior lab. In the interior of a star, the particles so that they stick together temperature. The higher the temperature, calculated what temperatures are needed of light atoms. Billions Those are the temperatures that would there are no such temperatures Calculations show that it doesn't exist. only source of energy in stars is thermonuclear the interior of the star do not allow Leningrad physicist Georgy Gamow solved &quot;So we need to accelerate the proton barrier&quot;. That is, for it to approach, approach it, to pass over this potential close, approaching the second proton, which are not electrical, but of a different into the nucleus of a more complex chemical in order to rise to this, as physicists repulsive force. It can't, it doesn't motion to rise above And Gamow with the help of quantum that time, showed that any small particle the barrier, to pass, as they say, to mountain, to pass this distance, only says that any particle is smeared in several places, and it may immediately end up in the next place, matter what wall separates the two points. was discovered by a young man, less than Gamov. Then he worked in the US and became case, he showed that thermonuclear temperatures. Five, ten million degrees, Two protons flying, and they get so close they're going to into a stable system. In doing so, one transforms from a proton into a very charge, a neutron. And it throws its positron, the antiparticle And then, having thrown away the positron neutrino particle, it forms two protons, proton plus a neutron. The nuclear force no electrical repulsion because the somewhere out there in the distance. What is this? It's still a nucleus of hydrogen, deuterium. Every now and then it meets another around. And what happens? They combine, new chemical element. It says helium. Two with no charge, that's a They fly around until they meet And what happens to the extra particles throw the two protons strongly repelled by the electric charges two protons, two neutrons. Physicists call is a helium nucleus of the standard heavy in balloons, when we hold them on a string, And when they do. the extra protons are ejected with such and heat up the gas around them, that's the The process of thermonuclear reactions is the inner workings of the Sun. It begins diheterium nucleus. This crucial step Another proton is then added to create into helium-four. In this manner, four nucleus, while also producing positrons there are some minor reactions, they do effect and are only considered If the star is slightly more massive and fascinating thermonuclear reactions to considered catalytic processes in the substance involved is not consumed but reactions with other substances. For in small amounts, it has the ability During the process, a helium nucleus is into nitrogen, and then into heavy carbon original form known as carbon-XII, the hydrogen is being transformed into helium cycle, which is an abbreviation for occurs less frequently, this cycle is the massive stars. The chain reaction continues of helium, followed by the addition of through the absorption of helium nuclei. expansion of the periodic table due to reactions. However, with each subsequent and challenging. Take note of the electric their charge of six protons, which requires reaction to occur. The more massive the star, the hotter it are the stars with their masses, in today, from fifty to one percent parameters, the size of the star, the temperature at the center and the radiation These calculations are very accurate and checked it all on astronomical observations. picture of not only external parameters of stars, total you can see, we can guarantee what the of degrees. That's a colossal temperature degrees in massive stars. The Sun is fifteen million degrees. The low-mass And this, in general, is a reliable But how do you test it directly? How can we see those thermonuclear inside the star? While we only indirectly the form of general radiation, how can we have a clue. Look, when two protons a positively charged electron is ejected. long to live. It immediately meets a and they both disappear, become quanta see, it disappears into the depths is a neutrino particle. The neutrino interacts so weakly with almost leaves the Sun at the speed of noticing the entire thickness of matter, surface of the Sun, goes into space. And then That is, eight minutes ago, those neutrinos, born in the core of the Sun. So This presents an exceptional chance to the center of our celestial body. The only and record them accurately. our laboratory setup, our detector. Suffice it to say Every single square centimeter of our penetrated by a mind-boggling influx of the Sun per second. We don't notice it. Billions, billions of right now and going further. And it's evening There, on the other side of the Earth. through us and they go that way. And the device doesn't notice. So the least something from this stream. The physicist, even chemist-experimenter Raymond from the sixty-eighth year he tried to was built deep, a kilometer and a half this crust of the Earth would from space except the neutrinos, which big, big tank, filled it with a substance and carbon atoms, the most sensitive to into radioactive argon under the influence going to record. well, I don't know, I don't know, I just it. Almost four hundred,zero gallons of the liquid that dry cleaners use to clean volatile liquid, or perchloroethane In a gigantic tank, a week's time saw the these atoms needed to be extracted from measuring their quantity and determining The scientist bore the responsibility for years but even decades to conducting conclusively demonstrated that neutrinos It seemed like a victory It led to a significant burden within could even describe it as a crisis. development from the 1970s onward, when publication because the neutrino flux measured was three times It didn't add up. We were expecting the times less. Physicists told us, you don't know how the there. We measured the neutrino flux, and than astrophysics predicts. We timidly told the physicists, yes, we did. We made new models of the Sun, composition, that it is spinning, that wanted to slow down the reactions so that from there. &quot;But,&quot; the physicists said timidly, &quot;Ea neutrino is? We have a theory of elementary right, well, we'll try, we'll And we did, we made other that neutrinos come in three different positron corresponds to an electron-type of the electron. These are The mu-particle and the tau particles are the particles we usually focus on. In created, and we anticipated them to come other types of neutrinos. The physicists rest mass, so they travel at the effectively stops for them. As a result, light, they do not have the opportunity particles. Even though they are generated is essentially the same moment in time time to undergo metamorphosis. Therefore, of electron neutrinos. Well, gradually new detectors were made. thousand years in Canada was built a new ability to register not only electron, but three types of neutrinos registered, it arrives from the Sun as much as the Sun that on the way from the Sun to transformations. And instead of the flow but of three different colors, three it's conditional. They don't And then the astrophysicists and said, well, we knew how the Sun neutrino. It has a rest mass, it travels although not by much, almost the same, transform on its way from the Sun to the arrogantly at physicists and wait for them particles, which would take into account victory for astrophysics in Well, all right. Energy was born somewhere thermonuclear reactions are taking place. is from the surface into outer space. Well, we know three types of energy transfer. hot spoon in your tea, it gets hot on air rises up from a hot body. And it's infrared light. Infrared radiation conduction is weak there. But convection, liquid from below, it boils and carries from the pot to somewhere in the kitchen. it happens in stars too. And it mixes the and carries the heat from the interior by conduction in the form of quanta of but convection is almost the main carrier to the outside. The star is boiling, So we have already covered the basic the life of stars. Firstly, stars are spectra of stars, which include different blue, we can see that they are heated to Some stars reach temperatures as high others are in the thousands, and there could likely heat a piece of iron in your it would emit a similar glow to a star, We see that stars differ not only in masses, giving rise to various evolutionary all we can perceive is its outward appearance. of energy it radiates, the strength of on its surface. All this information is continue to explore this fascinating their intricate lives. we can construct a two-dimensional picture units of the Sun's radiative power, of taken. The surface temperature. And it are distributed along this diagonal. and weakly powerful and quite cold on surprising, is it? The hotter the surface, it turns out that there are stars that emitters. What It means they have So they're big in size, we call them giants. that are hot, you see, The surface temperature of white dwarfs thousands of degrees, making them very temperatures, they emit minimal light and These types of stars, consisting of a white dwarfs and red giants. The main percent of all stars in our galaxy, Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This diagram twentieth century by two astrophysicists, from America. It serves as a temperature the main sequence and its significance in more specific classifications exist within subgiants and supergiants, these details courses. Hence, the main sequence of stars both professionals and enthusiasts. Deciphering the evolutionary analysis our Sun evolve with time. At present, benchmarks, where the Sun is currently temperature, size, and radiation In the past, the Sun was a little bit smaller in size, had a much smaller radiation output, and it does today. And in the future, we can long as the physics of the processes are clear. As and increase the power and cool down a little bit on the surface. its surface temperature by a But by increasing of the surface of light, the radiation Fortunately, we're lucky with the Sun, to simulate the life stars similar to the Sun, but with a turns out they would have a very different around us, luckily not our Sun. Here's elements. Astronomers call as heavy helium. These two elements. Well, that's how we got hydrogen and call everything else metals. Although everything else is metals. There's a fraction of a percent of them, pinch of salt and a micro pinch of salt two? It's a big difference. Because these for the rapid passage of energy from the They intercept the quanta and make them and stretch its life out over a longer is today, four and a half billion years billion years of quiet evolution ahead And if our Sun had been born with less life today. Maybe And man would not have had time to become solar system evolution would would not have had enough time to evolve But fortunately, the Sun is slowly changing, of quiet life in store. And then? And then the evolutionary model of the Sun again. and reaches a very high value. Why? produced there instead, and it does not at those low temperatures, which are slag is deposited there, deposited, compacted small, gravity on its surface is strong, temperature and burns more and more the core of the Sun, helium is accumulating decreasing. And there is almost one incapable of thermonuclear combustion. hydrogen around it. And it continues to and becomes more and more intense, Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, the Sun evolution will begin to increase its will increase five times, twenty to expand. Why? Well, I've come up with a balloon. Look, we buy a balloon, but we used to form of this rubber band. It's opaque. We start to inflate it, and as it expands, The same substance spreads out over a more transparent. of the star heat is released more and the heat somehow or it's just going to it expands, it becomes more it's easier for That's the reason why stars expand at the builds up, and the shell expands to release is the entire timeline of the Sun's series of evolutionary of gas, as it evolved, burning hydrogen halfway there. There will be an increase forward, but so far it's not ten percent increase in the Sun's radiative era. That's almost imperceptible. A billion it starts to change very rapidly, and in will swell into a huge red ball. We It will lose its shell, it's already it will expand, and the core will remain incapable of further thermonuclear continue the fusion process at high will almost leave It's not a fantasy. We observe solar-type and we see that there are giants, and gigantic. The Sun is like this today, let's compare in this illustration what be like in a few billion years. And Well, of course, I'm showing you a accurate calculations, we know how each will travel along this And we also know this. are the &quot;not-yet-stars&quot;. Those that are their lifetime. Notice, this is our Sun. the more and more massive stars. These are percent of the Sun's mass is where this an initial mass ten percent of the solar mass, or it will never be able to start the fusion there won't rise above three million not be able to participate in thermonuclear to become a star, start to cool and forget that it ever wanted to be a will start a thermonuclear reaction in state for billions, billions of years, into helium. Here's a small difference difference in the future body. These are dwarfs. They wanted to become a star, billions of years, but they didn't have become planets, gradually cooling down, imagine the life The cloud of gas shrank, heated up, Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, it ignited and burned hydrogen for billions of years. to expand, became red elegance, dropped turned into such a slag. First a white dwarf... A white dwarf, then a During this fading already in the last star, for a while it Its stationary state is no longer possible. star begins to pulsate. The change in particular region. We've always seen stars like this, but understand it. Here in front of you cluster. This is the center, this is the are flashing there? We've been tracking variable brightness stars, but we We felt like they but for what reason, I don't know. Their astronomer by profession, but by a working in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. processes, and in radio engineering interested in astronomy, in particular realized the physics of this process, that there, it lets the radiation through, star. And the star changes its brightness beats, as it shows itself on the cardiogram stage of evolution Well, you'd think we'd figured it out and pulsating stars, they're called Cepheids in the constellation Cepheus, they've and they've helped us make a Because the period of their pulsation radiative power. This was first discovered astronomer, a deaf-mute woman by the twentieth century, and she saw in her statistical observations that the pulsation period of its surface So when we see such a pulsating star in few months of observation, find out what out the exact value of its own radiation, the power of its apparent brightness of the star, we can very hard problem for astronomy to measure here the Cephiid stars have proven to distance to distant galaxies. So important, allowed us to discover in the Universe because they make it galaxies, so the expansion rate of the galaxies. It's a colossal discovery, It's a remarkable story. She was housekeeper And he managed a small group of men, as work at the start of the century. However, intrigued and he shared his knowledge home, not only in cleaning but also in she was more efficient than the men on his instead hired twenty-four women for the team came to be known as &quot;Pickering's harem,&quot; and No, only scientifically. And they made him Henrietto Levitt and this dependence, other measure. They worked magnificently, and staff in our institute are women, that's for science, especially in the nineteenth showed themselves So, we're coming to the final stages of We've already figured it out. Those that into red giants, inflated, gradually lose and turns into such a cloud of gas leaving planetary nebulae, because the star is a surface very symmetrically in the form Yes, the Hubble telescope has shown us, us that there are also such planetary some incredible pattern of lost gas, already seen, these are planetary, understand how a balloon star can organize of material of matter moving away from the surface, is a set of separate shells, and an that are ejected in diametric directions. forces it does this, gravity plus magnetic is beautiful and has yet to find an half of its mass, and the other half Planetary nebulae are well studied, the glows, we will see, and the nucleus itself star, it's often comparable in size to white dwarfs. They were discovered rather can hardly see them. They were discovered century, and here was a young theorist, India, worked for the first years, there I think, twenty-four years old, a recent for the first time made a calculation, And it turned out that the white dwarf maintains itself in equilibrium, gravity equilibrium by quantum mechanical forces, a long time can not resist gravity. And it turned out that if we cold body, and planet, build up its mass, then at first then the type of but when it reaches a mass of about one can keep itself in equilibrium and Formally, to zero in size. He was censured for this. he was reviled, they didn't believe in wanted to work in England, but they almost saying that such a thing could not became a Nobel Prize winner in physics, And we now know that white dwarfs cannot than one and a half times more massive them. It's especially interesting when one of the most well-studied stars, this is what we see this is what we telescope, into X-rays, and it's up to the artist looks like. A normal, ordinary star, like and they revolve around a common center small, but massive, and it pulls the matter from its neighbor, and it gradually falls disk, because the orbital motion is and so such double systems, where a matter from its neighbor, we These white dwarfs, referred to as 'they', small and unnoticeable. However, when they stars, an accretion disk forms and emits by the friction of its rapidly rotating radiation, including infrared, ultraviolet, extra matter continues until a accumulates on the white dwarf. This of matter falling onto that's already capable of a thermonuclear of helium, which at at this temperature does not catch fire, pure hydrogen, and hydrogen is just waiting and when it has accumulated there a lot, the white dwarf synthesis of hydrogen, the form of an explosion and in the sixteenth, seventeenth centuries time flashes of bright stars in the sky, one thousand nine hundred and first year take pictures, we see, there is a double next to it, and during thermonuclear dwarf, the ejected matter has It still continues to accumulate, matter over the span of a few decades. may ignite this fresh matter and unleash its surface. However, that is not the Consider the two white dwarfs that emerge system. These As they orbit around a common center reason for this is that they, this dual-mass waves. Now we register them on Earth, process. Through the loss of energy to move closer together merge, collide, and unite, they form a equilibrium. Eventually, this conglomerate leading to intense heating and eventually result, the entire system And that's what we observe, that's what the way we envision the life of a star Sun, at the end of its life loses matter turns into a white dwarf, but it can, if stick together with it and explode like explode, nothing will remain of it, or a star, an even denser and the cores of stars that surpass the Sun within the star. The nucleus is so dwarf phase, and promptly transforms into This process results in a substantial explosively shed its outer layer as a exceedingly massive, it continues eventually collapses into a black hole. observed in other galaxies rather than occurrence. In fact, the last observed the seventeenth century. Although it wasn't then were able to observe such an event. many of them, when you look at hundreds is happening. Here we have the Whirlpool there, you can see there's a new star. That's a not a spectacular event, so to speak, billions of stars. This is the glow of And this, as it lights up, rivals them all with all of them in terms So it's comparable to the glow of an entire galaxy containing unveils remarkably potent explosions- the the Universe. Can we anticipate and foresee stars? Yes, we can. Presently, our efforts that. An example is Betelgeuse in Orion, a supernova. In fact, it has already transformation in its size is visibly contrast to most stars, Betelgeuse, along mere points but as bodies with distinct expanded in size to a colossal extent, available models provide us with an its surface. This is the boiling process a model, of course. It's let's go back, here's this picture of atmosphere. And the model shows us how interior create such colossal temperature have a pretty accurate representation of the model, and it's almost exactly the So keep an eye on the constellation Orion witness a supernova explosion. We already fifty,zero years. We can't be more precise because we can is going to happen in the interior. If we had the capability and detectors, we could closely monitor predict when its explosion will occur, currently lack such advanced The explosion phenomenon in the core of supercomputers, allowing us to visualize will now present a movie that showcases model of the explosion. Watch closely unfolds at the center. Although it occurs slowed down the footage to display explosion appears slightly asymmetrical, towards the section where it can easiest resembles the rise of a mushroom cloud moving towards an area with lower atmospheric explosion starts off-center, leading direction. However, due to the high star. Eventually, you will observe the of the star, at a point antipodal to the supernova explosion exemplifies this progresses, the substance begins to Remarkably, such asymmetric ejections The beauty of this spectacle is undeniable. calculation required months of extensive produce these impressive We can do it here in a few minutes. But the mass of nuclear reactions and had to be calculated. carefully calculated. Here such supernova star is a rather intricate and more or less resembles the Orion looks like this. This is how we Betelgeuse explodes, It's not a big deal. Well, it'll be a brighter than the full moon. So we The radiation emitted during a supernova than that of a large solar flare. While of Earth, near the planet's surface, Earth would experience a noticeable find a way to survive the radiation shock. remains safe. The radiation power gradually the supernova explosion, then decreases Eventually, we are no longer able to see anything, A thousand years ago, a supernova exploded today, this is the result of its explosion. the very last episode in the life of the which is a neutron star. That's where the made by a young PhD student at for which her supervisor Antony didn't get it. To this day, the Nobel hers. She became a famous scientist. But discovered these very nuclei of exploding were discovered by their strange periodic rapidly and sending out radio pulses. We pulsars. More than two thousand radio they are neutron stars, that is, the massive stars. There are various unique ways that the white dwarfs, such as the fate of the typically how massive stars conclude their sure you are quite familiar with black everyone, including schoolboys. Black Let me provide you with a complete overview Brown dwarfs do not transition into phase entirely. Most stars eventually our Sun. Massive stars, on the other black holes. However, the most astronomically extraordinary way that not even a black explosion disintegrates That's not to say this is the final picture. evolution, there's still a lot of things where we should end The question from the Internet to the be grateful if you I'm writing an science fiction story. As And I'm gathering various What would be the fate of a living being the fabric of reality or the occurrence a magnetar or neutron star were to appear lie ahead? A magnetar is a neutron star with a very strong fields too. Nothing will happen, The fantasy story will be over quickly. Of course, otherwise. All right. What other planet, besides Mars, There seem to be contenders for relocating future. Mars, of course, the most promising, the giant planets. These are Io, Europa, of Saturn, on which the conditions temperature comfort zone will move away to planet in search of the What about the atmosphere, On Mars it's almost gone today, yes, but cold today, frozen, but when it gets little bit more favorable on Mars. I than today. And then on the satellites amount of water, and at least we will to find continents there, but in the end are from there, and we've adapted. What about the Moon? About the moon, it'll be the same as the they'll get worse By the way, the latest calculations show will first eat Mercury, just dive inside, doubts whether the expanding Sun will calculations show that it will reach out Moon will dive into Can a star cool down to the And what would such a mineral or substance And what can we say about gravity White dwarfs, which are formed from stars to two solar masses, will primarily hand, will form a white dwarf made of undergoes fusion and transforms into thermonuclear reactions. Consequently, carbon-based bodies under the What happens when carbon When carbon is compressed? The calculations indicate that it could crystal. The purpose of one that enormous A diamond. Totally envision a star composed I'm pretty sure of it. Question for the hit the Earth or not? It will, but not fatally. That is, our radiation, just as it saves us from Earth's atmosphere What is your understanding of None so far. It's amazing No, no, there are hypotheses. These are to us. Physicists have a rough idea properties make them very difficult to world are building machines to catch the Novosibirsk University for the third winter to give physics students a little there is a very large Institute of Nuclear built a facility to search for dark understand a little bit of the general, what they are looking for, where these real chance to installations exist, but catching it reports of captures, but each time they far, it hasn't been caught. Is there any evolution in large All celestial bodies have an evolutionary fact that the giant planets - specifically radiate more heat than they receive possess a strong internal source of processes occurring within these planets evident that some elements sink towards the surface. This differentiation in heat. Even without the presence of the undergo internal transformations and different billions of years ago, satellites. Over time, it has cooled down, future. Nonetheless, planets have their We've got continents Well, and also when there are changes in when Jupiter migrates. But it's not actually the planet changing, that's changing. Also And a little bit of Please tell us about the near What neutrino telescopes do they plan study there? The Sun remains the sole accessible source Additionally, in the rare event of a neutrinos is emitted within a few seconds, distant locations such as the far end of found worldwide, with a particular Caucasus. Multiple countries possess focus their attention on studying the Sun of a supernova explosion. Up until now, 1987, during which only one neutrino Yes, there was only one neutrino telescope. And he, I think, three or four neutrino effect for physics. And now we are waiting because there are already dozens of They are being built, and a neutrino Lake Baikal, and at the bottom of the the Pacific Ocean, and in the mountains shield the detector from foreign influences for what we're really looking Is it possible that such mixing of the processes exactly in Oh, it's hard to talk about the convective almost homogeneous. It has no energy The red giant is what swelled up on the the white dwarf, it's the core that no the thermonuclear What here is a red giant is a shell planetary nebula and goes away altogether. dense nucleus, which, well, if it is freed dwarf, and if it is not freed, still lives until the moment when What about shell explosions? In the case of shells, the conditions temperature are both low. On the other understood to some extent through quantum to maintain equilibrium due to quantum property of degenerate matter is that as not increase. In a typical explosion, internal pressure causes the object to abruptly ends. However, in the case of reactions, as the temperature rises and pressure remains constant and the star when all the matter within the star explodes in an explosion. This happens because recognize the fact that the process of to accelerate, and then it realizes, too You showed a graph that showed the temperature the Sun, and there was a in the surface temperature. of the surface temperature, and for some there's a sharp drop. And that's because the star has expanded cooled. They have already become so far released, that while the heat reaches infrared. The energy density liquefies, quite cold quanta of such red, infrared cooling shell of an Astrophysicists speculate at this point, The Great Attractor is a discovery that galaxies. We saw that the Universe is not fly away evenly in all directions somewhere far away from our galaxy, a little bit more strongly than others, There's a little more density of matter universe. Well, it's only big in terms there, and they're expanding in our neighborhood. There, the initial density expansion process is not as active as neighbors live. Well, it's not a big will still fly apart. Today we know that the fate of both our galaxies is clear. them, it will still let them go, and accelerating their movement. Dark energy will win Yes. As the Sun expands, is there a chance Sun or fly farther away? There's pressure, but it's very weak, and For example, when the Sun expands to the the Sun is already close to the Earth's approach the Sun due to the fact that surface under the influence of Earth's surface of the Sun, transferring to gradually spiral closer. The Sun will will approach at this time to the surface losing the energy of orbital motion. The it and will not solve the problem, the the Sun, it is already I have a completely philistine question. when gravitational waves were The year before last. The question is, when is it possible to understand the source, that is, the gravitational waves are coming from. That the sky, which way is the Yeah, well, not the center of the universe, No, this has nothing to do with the big waves that we have recorded in the past the merging of black holes or neutron is the abrupt merger of two bodies. It is have only detected these explosions in detectors located in the United States. of the gravitational waves within a recent registration of gravitational waves the seventeenth, when Italy's third detector With the addition of this detector, we which allows for triangulation and makes reliable. We directed optical telescopes observed optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray true source where the stars had merged. hours, and we were able to capture and actual detection of the flare was made react quickly to such events and are instruments, our very own MSU university capture the flare. Do we currently have the simultaneous Yes, occurring right now? you've seen positrons, positively charged protons merge. That's antimatter. The electron. But its fate is just that, unite with it, and both of them will electromagnetic radiation will fly. That the first encounter with ordinary matter, You said that stars are almost the only Yes. else is there? Well, radioactive elements decay in the significant role of the sun. If the consequences would be immediate, resulting However, underground dwellers would not Surprisingly, Professor Zavarzin's harbors a greater biomass of living elephants, rhinos, and trees on the that if the sun were to vanish, life as worth noting that biology would still Earth's interior, a process unrelated to every planet generates a certain amount sunlight is far more significant for Jupiter, as it receives a comparable amount receives more heat from its interior radiates some light towards it. Therefore, possess their own distinctive heat sources, sustaining their Almost, in terms of In terms of quantity, some planets are illuminates them. But for us, of What happens to the outer shell of matter a different substance... Into a disk. It's very simple. As matter pulls toward rotational velocity. But this conservation But the centrifugal force only balances rotation. But centrifugal force cannot substance. Therefore along the axis it is stopped from falling by the influence of My physics teacher, he's always questioning to the concept He says, what kind of black A black hole is a massive object. However, that its physical surface is positioned becomes trapped by the strong gravitational boundary, known as the Schwarzschild once crossed, there is no chance of going onto a regular star, a white dwarf, or a approaches from a distance or not, it visible impact. Yet, in the case of a outside quietly plunges inward, leaving objects that behave this way, in which surface shows no indication of impact. Consequently, based on these matching can be classified as black holes. While their behavior aligns perfectly with entities are dubbed From what I comprehend, the instrument the year 2018. Do you know the instruments It's better. Angular? No, no. A global construction will focus on? resulting in a system of radio telescopes clarity. Spread across the globe, there that can capture the surface of a black achievement marks a significant leap celestial phenomena. Well, literally this year We'll see it then. So we'll wait a little bit. No, well, we know several dozens of such black holes. Suspicions are almost hundred them all the same, having looked at In two thousand fourteen years by machines such as Hitomi radioactive emission in I am considering x-rays Chandra is an X-ray satellite. Chandra you the portrait of today. There was an unidentified, Thank you. Yes, that's a very interesting that we seem to have picked up some Dark matter. It's suspected that its particles emit electromagnetic quanta. And just American X-ray telescope in the world's detected just the very spectral line dark matter, Yes, yes, yes, yes, that's it. Well, it's still to be would be great. About the first slides, where we get basically, it came from this How do we know that? By direct measurement dark matter manifests by studying the motion of distant stars, galaxy because it attracts moving stars So we've measured the and then we looked at how much real matter planets, interstellar gas. It turns out mass is provided by stars and small planets, stuff. That's why we called it Dark any way, but gravity Dark energy is more complicated. In one we first discovered this fact. The scattering of galaxies in all directions, slowing down. Just like when you pick up then it might There comes a point when an object direction. On the other hand, if it is space but eventually be pulled back by galaxies drift apart, they also exert Scientists hoped that our understanding - that the expansion of the Universe, would gradually decelerate. However, in expansion of the Universe was actually that there must be an unknown force opposing between galaxies and pushing them apart medium that resides between galaxies and antigravity or mutual repulsion. To speed of light by the square of the average density. In physics, energy and As a result, it was deduced that this outweighs anything else in the universe, matter. This is how scientists Thank you all, and I'll
