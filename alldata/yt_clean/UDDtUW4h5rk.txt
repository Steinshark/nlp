[THEME MUSIC] &gt;&gt;&gt; WELCOME TO ITALICS. TELEVISION FOR THE ITALIAN AMERICAN EXPERIENCE. I'M YOUR HOST ANTHONY TAMBURRI. RACIAL IDENTITY. FOR MANY, THERE IS NO QUESTION WHERE THEY STAND WITHIN OUR SOCIETY. WHETHER AT THE EXTREMES OF HOLDING THE STRINGS AT THE TOP OF THE HIERARCHY OR PROFILED AS CRIMINALS FOR THEIR VERY EXISTENCE. FOR OTHERS THE QUESTION OF RACIAL IDENTITY, AS DETERMINED BY COLOR, IS MORE BLURRED. AS ITALIAN-AMERICANS, WE HAVE EXAMINED QUESTIONS WHETHER ITALIANS ARE WHITE. WE HAVE CONSIDERED THE LENGTH ONE MUST GO TO IN ORDER TO ASSIMILATE AND WHETHER MUST NECESSARILY ASSIMILATE. DO WE WANT IN OR OUT OF A SYSTEM THAT'S EXCLUSIONARY? IN HIS NEW BOOK, &quot; A GREAT CONSPIRACY AGAINST OUR RACE: ITALIAN IMMIGRANT NEWSPAPERS AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF WHITENESS IN THE EARLY 20th CENTURY&quot; PETER VELLON EXPLORES THE ROLE OF THE RADICAL PRESS OF ITALIAN IMMIGRANTS INTO THE DOMINANT WHITE CULTURE FROM 1886 THROUGH 1920. THE TOPIC IF ONE THAT STILL RESONATES CLEARLY TODAY. COMMEMORATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH AND THE INCREASED AWARENESS AND ACTIVISM WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT MONTHS ABOUT THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT. LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH SCHOLAR PETER VELLON. &gt;&gt; PETER TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; &quot;GREAT CONSPIRACY AGAINST OUR RACE&quot; IS REALLY AN EXAMINATION OF THE ITALIAN LANGUAGE PRESS IN NEW YORK CITY. I TREAT IT AS A CULTURAL PRODUCTION OF THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. REALLY THE PURPOSE BEHIND IT WAS TO EXAMINE HOW THE PRESS CONSTRUCTED AN IDENTITY FOR ITALIANS THAT DIDN'T EXIST UPON THEIR ARRIVAL. REALLY WHAT IT TALKS ABOUT IS HAVING NEGOTIATED THIS IDENTITY AS ITALIANS AND OVER TIME AS AMERICANS AND BY 1910, 1920 CALLING THEMSELVES &quot;WHITE.&quot; &gt;&gt; IF YOU LOOK AT A PAPER LIKE THE EL PROGRESSO, I THINK THE HEIGHT OF ITS CIRCULATION RIGHT OUT OF THE WORLD WAR I PERIOD. TALKING ABOUT 175,000 COPIES. BY 1919 THAT CIRCULATION IS ABOUT 108,000. BUT THERE'S ALSO A 16-PAGE SUNDAY SUPPLEMENT THAT THEY PUBLISH THAT HAS A CIRCULATION OF 95,000 OR SO. THAT'S JUST ONE NEWSPAPER. SO BY 1910 YOU ARE TALKING OF ALL THE ITALIAN LANGUAGE PRESS IN NEW YORK CITY IN 1910, TALKING ABOUT CIRCULATION OF ABOUT 200,000 PAPERS. THAT DOESN'T EVEN -- DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THESE PAPERS BEING HANDED TO PEOPLE TO READ. OKAY? AS WELL AS THIS CONSTANT -- THERE IS A TON OF CONTEMPORARY OBSERVATIONS ABOUT HOW THESE PAPERS WERE READ ALOUD TO FOLKS IN THEIR HOMES, IN THEIR KITCHENS, AROUND THE FIRE. SO THEIR REACH WAS MUCH MORE THAN CIRCULATION. &gt;&gt; I MENTION THE COMMERCIAL PRESS, MAINSTREAM PRESS, WE'LL CALL IT FOR OUR PURPOSES THE NEWSPAPERS STARTED BY WHAT BECOME KNOWN AS THE PROMINENT PEOPLE, SO-CALLED SELF-PROCLAIMED IN MANY INSTANCES COMMUNITY LEADERS, OF THESE ITALIAN COMMUNITIES. DURING THIS FLUID PERIOD OF IMMIGRATION NEWSPAPERS WORKED THROUGH THEIR OWN NOTION OF HOW ITALIAN IMMIGRANTS SHOULD ACT AND BEHAVE, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY TRYING TO DEFEND THEIR RACE FROM AMERICAN ATTACKS ON THEIR SUITABILITY FOR CITIZENSHIP AND THEIR FULL INCLUSION IN AMERICAN SOCIETY. THESE ATTACKS WERE NOT ONLY FIGURATIVE, IN WORDS, BUT LITERAL ATTACKS. I LOOK AT HOW THE PRESS TREATS AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THE UNITED STATES WITH RESPECT TO VIOLENCE AGAINST AFRICAN-AMERICANS, AND GIVEN THAT THERE IS VIOLENCE AGAINST ITALIAN IMMIGRANTS. THEY REALLY USE THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN EXPERIENCE INITIALLY AS A KIND OF A SHARED EXPERIENCE. THEY MAKE SENSE OUT OF AMERICAN VIOLENCE AGAINST IMMIGRANTS BY COMPARING IT TO HOW AMERICANS TREAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS, WHICH IS KIND OF OBVIOUSLY INTERESTING BECAUSE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ITALIANS AND IT DID NOT GO UNNOTICED TO NEWSPAPER OWNERS THAT THIS WAS PRIMARILY A FORM OF MURDER AIMED AT AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THE UNITED STATES. EARLY ON, AS WE'LL SEE, THEY'LL FIND SOME COMMON GROUND WITH THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN EXPERIENCE. BUT SOON BECAUSE OF THIS LEARNING, OF WHAT HAPPENS TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THE UNITED STATES, OR THOSE DEEMED NON-WHITE, THEY SOON BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THE HEAVY STIGMA OF BEING VIEWED AS NON-WHITE OR, IN THEIR CASE, A BETTER PHRASE, I LIKE TO USE, THIS KIND OF IN-BETWEEN STATUS. SO WE'RE NOT MAKING A PARALLEL BETWEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF ITALIAN IMMIGRANTS AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS AT ALL, BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THIS KIND OF IN-BETWEEN STATUS, THAT IMMIGRANTS FROM SOUTHERN AND EASTERN EUROPE ARE KIND OF THRUST INTO IN THE LATE 19th AND EARLY 20th CENTURY IN THE UNITED STATES AND HOW DO THEY NEGOTIATE THIS STATUS. WHAT YOU BEGIN TO SEE IS BY 1890s, EARLY 1900s, IN THE MAINSTREAM PRESS THERE'S REALLY A STARK DISCUSSION OVER THE FACT THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE BEING DENIED THEIR RIGHTS BECAUSE THEY HAVE DARKER SKIN. WHITE SUPREMACY RESTS UPON OPPRESSION OF DARKER OTHERS. THE IMMIGRANT PRESS REALLY HAVE STRIDENT COMMENTARY AGAINST IT. THERE ARE OUTRIGHT COURTS THAT SAY THIS POOR BLACK MAN WAS LYNCHED JUST BECAUSE HE HAD DARKER SKIN THAN HIS OPPRESSOR. YOU SEE OBVIOUSLY IN THE RADICAL PRESS IT IS A MUCH MORE PROGRESSIVE VIEW. THERE'S -- THEY'RE COMING FROM A CLASS-BASED ANALYSIS BUT THERE IS CONSISTENT SCORN OVER WHITE SUPREMACY AS WELL AS CAPITALIST EXPLOITATION. I EXPECTED THAT BUT WHAT I DIDN'T EXPECT WAS THIS KIND OF IN-DEPTH DISCUSSION OF HOW WHITE SUPREMACY WORKED IN THE UNITED STATES. WHEN PAPERS ARE CONSISTENTLY USING AND COVERING THE LYNCHING OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS OR RACE RIOTS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE AROUND THE COUNTRY AND IN NEW YORK CITY INVOLVING WHITES AND BLACKS AND MAKING STRIDENT COMMENTARY SUCH AS -- I'M PARAPHRASING A QUOTE -- BUT IN ONE ARTICLE TALKED ABOUT A RACE RIOT THAT TOOK PLACE IN NEW YORK IN 1900. THEY BASICALLY SAID THE POOR -- NEGRO WAS THE WORD -- POOR NEGRO WAS RENDERED HELPLESS AND THE ROPE WAS PUT AROUND HIS NECK BY HIS WHITE OPPRESSOR SIMPLY FOR THE CRIME OF HAVING DARKER SKIN. SO WHEN I SAW STUFF LIKE THAT IN &quot;IL PROGRESSO&quot;, I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED. BUT NOT EVERY ARTICLE DURING THAT PERIOD WILL HAVE AS STRIDENT COMMENTARY LIKE THAT, BUT YOU DO SEE IT. AND THERE IS A LOT OF COVERAGE. AS THE PRESS IS KIND OF COVERING WHAT'S GOING ON WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN IN THE UNITED STATES AND KIND OF PUTTING THEIR FINGER ON, HEY, THESE FOLKS ARE BEING LYNCHED BECAUSE THEY'RE DARKER, BLACK -- RIGHT -- THAN WHITE AMERICANS, THEY'RE ALSO COVERING WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR COMMUNITY. YOU DO SEE A NUMBER OF LYNCHINGS OF ITALIAN IMMIGRANTS OVER IN 1886 THERE'S ONE. THERE'S THREE IN THE 1890s. SO THERE'S THIS KIND OF UNEASY PLACE THAT THEY ARE IN. RIGHT? AND HOW DO THEY RESPOND TO THAT? WELL, INITIALLY THEY RESPOND TO THAT BY BEING HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE UNITED STATES, OBVIOUSLY. THEY CONDEMN AMERICAN SO-CALLED CIVILIZATION. OKAY? THEY ARE VERY ATTUNE TO THE FACT THAT SKIN COLOR IS THE PRIMARY DETERMINANT HERE AS THEY SEE IT IN TERMS OF WHITE SUPREMACY. THERE IS THIS KIND OF A SYMPATHY FOR THE PERIOD 1980s, EARLY 1900s, BUT THERE'S THIS KIND OF DUAL PURPOSE. AS THEY BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND HOW WHITE AMERICANS VIEW NON-WHITES AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING IN THE BOOK THAT ITALIAN IMMIGRANTS RETREATED SIMILARLY TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS, BUT THEIR RACE AND THEIR WHITENESS WAS IN QUESTION AT TIMES. THE RADICAL PRESS ARE GOING TO, WHEN IT IS TIME TO REALLY DISPLAY THEIR UTTER HORROR OVER SOMETHING, WHETHER IT BE THE FACT THAT MINERS WERE KILLED IN A STRIKE. YOU CAN SEE THAT ON STRIKE AND MINERS WERE KILLED BY A COAL COMPANY. YOU WOULD SEE THAT IN A RADICAL NEWSPAPER, FOR INSTANCE. OR IN A PROMINENTE NEWSPAPER, WHETHER IT WAS AN ITALIAN WAS LYNCHED. THEY HAD TO EXPRESS THEIR HORROR OVER WHAT AMERICA DID, YOU WOULD OFTEN SEE AFRICA BEING USED AS AN EXAMPLE TO KIND OF DESCRIBE SAVAGERY OR BARBARISM. OKAY? SO AFRICAN-AMERICANS CONSTANTLY DESCRIBED AS DARK, BLACK, MURKY, THIS KIND OF DARK, BLACK, MURKY PLACE. ONE COMMON STRATEGY WHEN THEY NEED TO CRITICIZE AMERICAN MORALITY OFTEN, AS I SAID, IN RESPONSE TO VIOLENCE AGAINST ITALIANS, WOULD BE TO COMPARE IT TO THE SAVAGERY OF AFRICA. AFRICA BECOMES A CONVENIENT TROPE FOR FOLKS WRESTLING WITH THEIR KIND OF QUESTIONABLE STATUS WITH WHAT THEY SEE AS AT TIMES A VERY INHOSPITABLE COUNTRY. AT THE SAME TIME YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE AMERICAN HIERARCHY WORKS, YOU BEGIN TO SEE BY THE 1910s, ESPECIALLY WORLD WAR I PERIOD, THEY REALLY BEGIN TO ASSERTIVELY CLAIM THAT NOT ONLY ARE THEY ITALIAN AND KIND OF CREATES THIS NEW CONSTRUCTION OF IDENTITY AS ITALIANS THAT DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE, THEY ASSERT THEIR WHITENESS VERY VEHEMENTLY. YOU SEE THIS IN SEVERAL NEWSPAPERS. YOU SEE THIS IN TERMS OF FIGHTING AGAINST IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION LAWS WHERE THEY BASICALLY SAY, LOOK, AMERICA IS A WHITE NATION AND WE BELONG IN AMERICA. WE ARE NOT AN INFERIOR RACE. WE ARE A CIVILIZED RACE AND THEY KIND OF CREATE A MYTHIC ITALIAN RACE THAT HARKENS BACK TO ROME AND THE RENAISSANCE THAT DIDN'T EXIST PRE-UNIFICATION OR EVEN POST UNIFICATION. THEY CONSTANTLY QUESTION AMERICAN CIVILIZATION BY PROPPING UP THE ITALIAN RACE. SO THEY'LL CONSISTENTLY CRITICIZE AMERICA FOR ACTING LIKE SAVAGES OF AFRICA AND SAY THAT WE DON'T DO THAT, WE ARE CIVILIZED, WE HAVE TAUGHT THE AMERICANS -- WE WERE CIVILIZED BEFORE THE AMERICANS. AND THIS IS HOW THEY'RE TREATING US. ITALIAN COLONIALISM PROVIDED THE PAPERS TO PRESENT A TOWN OF RACIAL IDENTITY AS CIVILIZED, AS CONQUEROR, ALL AROUND THE SUBJUGATION OF A DARKER &quot;OTHER.&quot; ALSO THOUGH, IT SERVED TO INFLUENCE AMERICAN FOR AMERICANS, IS SERVED TO DEFINE WHAT, QUOTE, UNQUOTE, REAL ITALIAN-AMERICANISM IS. WE ARE CIVILIZED CONQUERS. AND THEY CONSTANTLY TIE THIS INTO THIS MESSAGES OF GLORY OF ROME. THEY KIND OF CREATE THIS MYTHIC ITALIAN PAST ALMOST AS IF TO CONVINCE THEMSELVES RATHER THAN AMERICANS THAT IT WAS INSISTED QUOTE, &quot;WITHOUT A DOUBT, WITH THIS WAR, AMERICAN SYMPATHY WILL BE WITH ITALY, THAT IS WITH INTELLIGENCE AND CIVILIZATION AGAINST BARBARISM.&quot; SO THERE IS THIS KIND OF TOP-DOWN VERY CLASS-BASED CONSTRUCTION OF IDENTITY THAT THESE PROMINENTE ARE PUTTING OUT THERE IN THE PRESS. FOR THEMSELVES, FOR THE ITALIAN COMMUNITY, BUT ALSO FOR THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY WITH AN EYE TOWARDS AMERICAN READERS TO KIND OF SAY, LOOK, WE ARE NOT LIKE THOSE FOLKS YOU KEEP DEPICTING US AS, AND WE KNOW NOW WHAT IT MEANS TO KIND OF BE TREATED AS NON-WHITE AND WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT LIKE THAT. I KIND OF ARGUE THAT THIS IDENTITY CONSTRUCTION THAT'S TAKING PLACE WITHIN THE PAGES OF THE RADICAL PRESS AND THE PROMINENTE PRESS, BUT MORE SO THE BOOK KIND OF GEARS TOWARDS THE PROMINENTE PRESS GIVEN ITS MORE WIDESPREAD CIRCULATION AND I WOULD ARGUE A KIND OF GREATER IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY. NOT ALWAYS A BENEFICIAL IMPACT, BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT HAD A MORE WIDESPREAD IMPACT. &gt;&gt; IN 1920 ITALIANS ARE REALLY ASSERTING THAT WHERE THEY NEVER REALLY HAD BEFORE EARLIER IN THE CENTURY THAT THEY WERE WHITE AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED AS SUCH IN THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU SAYING THAT ITALIAN AMERICANS WERE CONSIDERED NOT WHITE, NOT WHITE ENOUGH? &gt;&gt; THERE IS THIS KIND OF HIERARCHY OF RACES THAT HAS BEEN CHANGING BY THE LATE 19th CENTURY THAT THE WAY WE TALK ABOUT RACE TODAY, LET ALONE THE WAY FOLKS TALKED ABOUT RACE 100 YEARS AGO. WHAT WE WOULD DEEM TODAY IS A NATIONALITY OR ETHNICITY. BACK THEN THEY SAW THEM AS RACES. OFTEN BIOLOGICALLY CONSTRUCTED. WE KNOW THAT RACE IS SOCIALLY CONSTRUCTED. BUT BACK THEN FOLKS ACTUALLY BELIEVED THAT YOU WERE KIND OF BORN WITH CERTAIN TRAITS THAT PERMEATED AND PERSISTED OVER GENERATIONS. SO ITALIANS ARE ENTERING INTO THE COUNTRY AS FREE WHITE PEOPLE. THEY WERE KIND OF IN THE WORD I USE AND OTHER HISTORIANS USE IS KIND OF IN BETWEEN THIS KIND OF WHITE AND BLACK HIERARCHY. THEIR RACIAL STATUS WAS QUESTIONED CONSISTENTLY. YOU SEE THAT IN GOVERNMENT REPORTS WHICH USED SOME OF THE PSEUDO SCIENCE AT THE TIME WITH ANTHROPOLOGISTS OF THE TIME ACTUALLY SAW SEPARATION BETWEEN NORTHERN ITALIANS AND SOUTHERN ITALIANS. SO THEY SEPARATED THOSE RACES. SAW THE SOUTHERN ITALIAN RACE AS INFERIOR. &gt;&gt; ONE PART OF THE REPORT SAYS A MAJOR CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION WAS DONE TO LOOK INTO THIS, QUOTE, UNQUOTE, PROBLEM WITH IMMIGRATION IN 1906. IT WAS THE MOST MONEY EVER SPENT ON A CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION UP TO THAT POINT. THEY SENT FOLKS TO ITALY, ALL PORTS OF EMBARKATION, FIND OUT WHERE THESE FOLKS WERE COMING FROM, WHERE THEY WERE GOING. LONG STORY SHORT, A DICTIONARY OF RACES OR PEOPLE WAS DIVINED AND USING KIND OF THE PSEUDO SCIENCE NOW, OF THE TIMES, IT'S KIND OF UGENIC INSPIRED, THEY HAD DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATIONS OF RACES OF PEOPLE AROUND THE GLOBE. IT IS NO COINCIDENCE THE FURTHER YOU WENT DOWN THE CHART YOU WERE DEEMED LESS CIVILIZED, MORE SAVAGE AND NOT WHITE. THE FURTHER YOU WENT UP THE CHART YOU WERE DEEMED MORE CIVILIZED, MORE PRONE TO BE ABLE TO EXIST IN A REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT, DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, FAIR-HAIRED AND WHITE. SO THAT'S HOW THESE ATTACKS WERE CONSTRUCTED. THAT'S WHY THERE'S SUCH AN UPROAR AT THE TIME OF THESE ITALIAN IMMIGRANTS COMING TO THE UNITED STATES, BECAUSE MANY AMERICANS, MANY OF THEM WERE PUSHING FOR IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION AS SOON AS ITALIANS STARTED COMING IN LARGE NUMBERS, FELT THEY WERE GETTING THE KIND OF DREGS OF EUROPE. THERE'S THIS KIND OF UNEASY EXISTENCE THAT THEY ARE KIND OF THRUST INTO IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THINGS LIKE VIOLENCE DIRECTED AT THEM IN THE FORM OF LYNCHING IS KIND OF STOKING THIS KIND OF ALMOST INFERIORITY COMPLEX, IF YOU WANT TO USE THAT PHRASE, OF ITALIAN IMMIGRANTS. AND MANY WAYS PUSHING PROMINENTE NEWSPAPER TO DEFEND THEIR OWN, AT THE SAME TIME SAYING, HEY, YOU ITALIAN IMMIGRANTS SHOULDN'T ACT LIKE THIS. AS SOON AS WE SEE IN THESE NEWSPAPERS, THESE OWNERS, EDITORS, JOURNALISTS, REALLY PUT FORTH A KIND OF FLEDGLING NOTION OF ITALIAN IDENTITY THAT ONLY RECENTLY HAD EMERGED OUT OF A UNIFIED ITALY. IT IS REALLY GOING TO BE A TOP-DOWN CLASS-BASED VIEW OF WHAT AN ITALIAN SHOULD BE. CONNECTION TO THE GROWING OF ROME WAS CONSISTENTLY CHARTED OUT. IT WAS KIND OF CREATION OF A UNIFIED ITALIAN PAST. ONE PRESS URGED THE ITALIAN MILITARY TO, QUOTE, WE CONQUER WHAT USED TO BELONG TO ROME. IN DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN ITALIAN CIVILIZATION AND AFRICAN SAVAGERY, ALL PROVINCIAL ITALIAN IMMIGRANTS WERE GATHERED INTO A COLLECTIVE IDENTITY THAT COULD STRETCH ITS LINEAGE BACK TO THE ROMAN EMPIRE. ONE THING TO REMEMBER ALSO IS THAT THE FOLKS THAT ARE PUSHING FOR IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION, THESE AREN'T SOME -- THOUGH WE LOOK BACK NOW AND SAY MAYBE THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY EXTREISTS -- THESE WEREN'T SOME FRINGE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE WERE VERY WELL RESPECTED FOLKS, PRESIDENTS OF UNIVERSITIES LIKE HARVARD, SENATORS, THAT WERE PUSHING FOR IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION AND ACTUALLY ARGUING THAT THESE FOLKS WERE GOING TO DILUTE THE AMERICAN RACE. THEY USED TERMS LIKE THEY WOULD MONGRELIZE THE AMERICAN RACE. THEY OBVIOUSLY HAD A DISTINCT DEFINITION OF WHAT AMERICAN WAS, USUALLY A WHITE ANGLO SAXON PROTESTANT RACE. THESE ARE FRINGE ORGANIZATIONS. THERE WAS SEVERE PUSH-BACK FROM THE MOMENT ITALIANS STARTED COMING IN LARGE NUMBERS AGAINST THEIR PRESENCE IN THE UNITED STATES. &gt;&gt; SO YOU SAY THAT THE PROMINENTE, THESE ETHNIC LEADERS, MANY OF THEM EDITORS OF NEWSPAPERS, WERE INTERESTED IN REFERENCING BACK TO ANCIENT ROME AND TO THE RENAISSANCE. AND I KNOW IT FROM YOUR BOOK AND PREVIOUS TALKS, YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS IDEA OF CIVILIZATION. &gt;&gt; COMING OUT OF UNIFICATION OF ITALY, THERE'S REALLY THIS CLASS-BASED TOP-DOWN CONSTRUCTION OF ITALIANS. THEY ARE COMING AT THE TIME FROM THINK OF THEMSELVES AS ITALIAN. THEY CONSIDER THEMSELVES AS A KIND OF ITALIAN NATION OR HAVING A KIND OF NATIONALISM AS ITALIANS SO THERE IS THIS ATTEMPT TO CONSTRUCT AN ITALIAN RACE. BY DOING THAT, IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY'RE CONSTRUCTING WHAT AN ITALIAN RACE SHOULD LOOK LIKE, THE PROMINENTE, AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY ALSO TALK ABOUT IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF ITALY WHAT THE ITALIAN RACE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE. WHAT THE ITALIAN RACE LOOKS LIKE IS A RACE THAT CAN SERIOUSLY TRACE ITS LINEAGE TO THE GLORY OF ROME, TO THE RENAISSANCE, ALL THE GREAT, YOU KNOW, FOLKS THAT CAME THROUGH THE PIPELINE, COLUMBUS, GARRABALDI. THERE ARE SUBSCRIPTION DRIVES AND MONUMENTS ARE ERECTED AS A WAY TO KIND OF GAIN PRESTIGE, NOT ONLY FOR THE COMMUNITY BUT ALSO FOR THIS KIND OF WIDER AMERICAN, IN THIS CASE NEW YORK CITY AUDIENCE, THAT, HEY, THIS IS WHO WE ARE, NOT THE DITCH DIGGERS AND FOLKS -- ORGAN GRINDERS YOU ARE DEPICTING US AS. IT IS KIND OF LIKE THIS IDENTITY THAT DOES NOT REALLY EXIST FRAMED BY A MYTHICAL ITALIAN PAST AND IT SERVES WELL FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROMINENTE, IT ENHANCES THEIR PRESTIGE BECAUSE THEY ARE THE FOLKS GETTING THE COLUMBUS STATUE BUILT. IT ENHANCES THEIR PRESTIGE BECAUSE THEY CAN WALK IN THE COLUMBUS DAY PARADE WITH A SASH AND -- BUT IT WAS ALSO A WAY TO KIND OF SHOW AMERICANS, THIS IS WHO ITALIANS ARE, RATHER THAN WHO WE ARE NOT. THERE'S ALWAYS THAT TENSION BECAUSE, AS I SAID EARLIER, THEY'RE CONSTANTLY DEFENDING THE VERY ITALIANS THAT THEY'RE SOMETIMES RAILING AGAINST. IT'S LIKE -- THEY'RE DITCH DIGGERS, BUT THEY'RE OUR DITCH DIGGERS. YOU CAN'T MAKE FUN OF THEM BUT WE'LL SHOW THEM HOW TO BE PROPER AMERICANS. BEING A CIVILIZED RACE WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THAT. &gt;&gt; SO IT'S ALMOST THIS KIND OF STRATEGY. IF WE CAN SHOW THEM THAT WE ARE CIVILIZED -- AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE THE GOODS IN THEIR MIND TO SHOW IT. WE HAD ROME. WE HAD THE RENAISSANCE. YOU CONSTANTLY SEE THIS. WHO ARE THE AMERICANS TO LYNCH US? THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT CIVILIZATION WAS 200 YEARS AGO. WE SHOWED THEM. IT WAS AN ITALIAN THAT BROUGHT CIVILIZATION TO THEM. THERE IS THIS CONSTANT ALMOST KIND OF SELF-RIGHTEOUS INDIGNANT ATTITUDE WHETHER THEY CRITICIZE AMERICAN MORALITY OR VALUES THAT, WE'RE THE ONES THAT CREATED THIS. IT IS AN ATTEMPT TO KIND OF SHOW AMERICANS WE BELONG BECAUSE WE'RE THE ONES THAT TAUGHT YOU HOW TO BE CIVILIZED. CIVILIZATION AND RACE AND COLOR. THEY ARE WORKING KIND OF IN TANDEM. &gt;&gt; GIVEN THE PERMANENTES AND NEWSPAPER EDITORS' SORT OF MASTER NARRATIVE ABOUT ITALIANS, CULTURE AND RACE, IS THERE ANY KNOWING THE DEGREE THE READERSHIP AND PEOPLE ON THE GROUND REALLY BOUGHT INTO THESE VERY NOTIONS? &gt;&gt; ALL WE CAN SAY IS THESE WERE VERY, VERY WELL CIRCULATED NEWSPAPERS. FOLKS WERE READING THIS. SOMETIMES IT IS PROBABLY NOT A GREAT COMPARISON BUT IN TALKS I'VE GIVEN I TALK ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF THE MEDIA TODAY AND WE CAN'T NECESSARILY PINPOINT HOW CERTAIN NEWS CHANNELS IMPACT FOLKS THAT ARE WATCHING BUT WE CAN GET A SENSE THAT -- HEARING A MESSAGE OVER AND OVER AGAIN PROBABLY DOES HAVE AN IMPACT. IN MY RESEARCH I DID FIND SOME LETTERS TO THE EDITOR. THERE WEREN'T AN OVERFLOW OF LETTERS WRITTEN TO THESE NEWSPAPERS. BUT GIVEN THEIR CIRCULATION AND GIVEN THEIR LARGE NUMBER OF PAPERS THAT TOUCH DIFFERENT HANDS IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE TYPES OF ARTICLES ANY WERE RUNNING, AS WELL AS CARTOONS, THAT TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES, I THINK WE CAN SAY THAT THEY PLAYED A REAL MAJOR ROLE, I WOULD SAY. NOT THE ONLY ROLE, BUT A MAJOR ROLE IN KIND OF FORMING THE KIND OF RACIAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THESE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. &gt;&gt; SO ITALIAN LANGUAGE NEWSPAPERS IN REALITY MEANT REMINDING WHITE AMERICANS THAT ITALIAN IMMIGRANTS BELONGED BY NOT ONLY APPEALING TO THE ITALIAN VIRTUES OF THE RACE BUT BY INSISTING THEY WERE SUFFICIENTLY WHITE. THIS IS REMINISCENT OF TONI MORRISON'S OBSERVATION THAT EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS BECAME AMERICAN BY, QUOTE, BUYING INTO THE NOTION OF AMERICAN BLACKS AS THE REAL ALIENS. ITALIAN AMERICANS ARGUED THAT IT WOULD BE THEIR CHILDREN WHO WOULD HELP SUSTAIN AN ENDURING FIRM OF AMERICAN WHITENESS NOTING THAT THE DIFFERENCES SEPARATING AMERICANS AND ITALIANS PALED IN COMPARISON TO THE DIFFERENCES SEPARATING WHITE AMERICANS AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS. ITALIAN-AMERICANS INCREASINGLY SITUATED THEMSELVES AS PART OF THE RACIAL SOLUTION RATHER THAN THE RACIAL PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; DO THESE ARGUMENTS AT THE TURN OF THE 20th CENTURY STILL RESONATE IN SOME WAYS FOR ITALIAN AMERICANS AND OTHER COMMUNITIES AS WELL IN THE 21st CENTURY? &gt;&gt; THEY RESONATE VERY MUCH SO, UNFORTUNATELY. IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE RACIAL INCIDENTS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST TWO OR THREE DECADES, YOU KIND OF HAVE TO TRACE BACK -- HOW DID WE GET HERE? WHY ARE SOME OF THESE BATTLES STILL BEING FOUGHT OUT? WHAT IS IT -- WHAT IS TO BE GAINED FROM THIS BUYING IN TO WHITENESS? OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT TO BE GAINED, AS WE KNOW, UNFORTUNATELY. IF WE LOOK BACK IN THE IMMIGRANT PAST, I THINK YOU SEE AN IMMIGRANT GROUP THAT IN MANY WAYS IS KIND OF, I WOULD ARGUE, KIND OF A POSTER CHILD FOR WHAT AMERICANIZATION DOES. AND SOME OF THAT COULD BE ARGUED AS A GOOD THING, BUT I WOULD ARGUE SOME OF IT IS NOT SO BENEFICIAL. THERE ARE GAINS AND COSTS TO, QUOTE, UNQUOTE, AMERICANIZATION. ONE OF THE SEVERE COSTS, I WOULD ARGUE, IS THAT IN BUYING INTO THIS NARRATIVE AND THIS CONSTRUCTION OF THIS ASSERTION OF HAVING TO SAY WE ARE ITALIAN AND CIVILIZED AND WHITE, WHAT THEY'RE BASICALLY DOING IS KIND OF BEING SOCIALIZED INTO AN AMERICAN RACIAL SYSTEM THAT PRIVILEGES WHITE OVER BLACK. I THINK YOU SEE THAT OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES, MAYBE NOT TO THE SAME DEGREE BUT WHEN YOU HAVE RACIAL INCIDENTS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN NEW YORK CITY, ESPECIALLY, INVOLVING ITALIAN-AMERICANS AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS. I THINK THAT THAT IN MANY WAYS REFLECTS THAT ITALIAN IMMIGRANTS PREVIOUSLY SEEN AS THE POSTER CHILD FOR THE MODEL IMMIGRANT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. ONE COULD SAY. IT'S ALMOST AS IF THEY BOUGHT IN SO WELL, THEY BOUGHT IN TO THIS NARRATIVE THAT IT MAY BEHOOVE THEM TO KIND OF LOOK AT THEIR PAST AND KIND OF SEE THAT MAYBE IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY, THAT THAT NECESSARILY WASN'T THE ONLY ROUTE TOWARDS BECOMING PART OF THE FABRIC OF THIS NATION. AND AGAIN, I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT ALL ITALIAN-AMERICANS ARE INVOLVED IN THESE INCIDENTS. BUT I THINK WE CAN SAY THAT PART OF OUR HISTORY AS AMERICANS HAS DEFINITELY SHOWN US THAT WE STILL HAVE A RACIAL PROBLEM IN THE COUNTRY TODAY. I THINK THAT THE MORE WE KNOW ABOUT IT AND HOW IT KIND OF WAS CONSTRUCTED IN THAT MANNER, THE BETTER WE'LL ALL BE. &gt;&gt; THANKS A LOT, PETER. &gt;&gt; THANKS, JARED. APPRECIATE YOU HAVING ME. &gt;&gt;&gt; DON'T SPEND YOUR PRICELESS TIME ASKING WHY ISN'T THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. IT WOULD ONLY BE TIME WASTED. THE QUESTION TO ASK IS, HOW CAN I MAKE IT BETTER? TO THAT THERE IS AN ANSWER. THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF THE LATE DR. LEO, OR DR. LOVE. ACCORDING TO SOME, THE EXPRESSION OF LOVE IN MANY FORMS CAN HAVE GREAT POWER FOR A POSITIVE CHANGE. HERE HE IS TO TEACH US SOME WORDS TO LOVE IN HONOR OF ST. VALENTINO WHOSE HOLIDAY IS OFTEN CELEBRATED IN THE COMPANY OF LOVED ONES. THE NAMED VALENTINE, DERIVED FROM VALENS, MEANS WORTHY, STRONG, POWERFUL. &gt;&gt;&gt; IN FACT, WE ALREADY SPOKE ABOUT LOVE. SO TODAY, BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF LOVE, WE'LL TALK ABOUT FRIENDSHIP. BETWEEN TWO FRIENDS. NOW, WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEONE, EITHER IT IS YOUR PARTNER, YOUR PARENTS, YOUR RELATIVES, YOUR FRIENDS, WHEN YOU SHOW LOVE, WHAT YOU DO? YOU GIVE A BIG HUG. AND SO LET ME GIVE YOU A BIG -- [ SPEAKING ITALIAN ] THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING ELSE. LET ME GIVE YOU THEN A BIG KISS. LET ME SAY CIAO WITH A BIG KISS TO EVERYONE. &gt;&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR WATCHING THIS EPISODE OF ITALICS. TUNE IN TO OUR NEXT EPISODE AIRING MARCH 25th. CATCH UP ON PREVIOUS EDITIONS AT CUNY.TV/SHOWS/ITALICS AND ADDITIONAL WEBISODES ON OUR ITALICS YOUTUBE CHANNEL ITALICSTV. I'M ANTHONY TAMBURRI. [THEME MUSIC]
