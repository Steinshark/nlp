It's time for my close-up. [symphonic music: &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;] I am in bingo hell. I got through my whole life without playing cards, dominos.... Dice. I don't drive a car. I don't play basketball football or baseball. I like swimming. And I hate... games. When I hear &quot;games,&quot; I feel like fingernails! Fingernails on a blackboard. And you know what one of them is? One of the best of all time? If you really want to get me going? Simple: &quot;Curtis...&quot; &quot;Let's play bingo!&quot; At a certain point I started feeling I wasn't really aware of what it was. It was about seven years ago. And I remember one day, I think was at work, I saw like this very small dot on my face. Almost like a pencil point. And somehow I just knew That it was AIDS. Something kind of went &quot;this is it.&quot; I kind of blocked it with my mind a bit. And I started not feeling well. I started turning kind of greenish. I just was getting kind of sicker and sicker. And then I started bleeding from my penis. Like clumps of blood. I would urinate and it would be normal. Then this blood would come out Like a knife going through me each time. So I knew I was going to have to go to the hospital. My boss was like &quot;you look sick. Something's wrong.&quot; I said &quot;yeah, I gotta go to the hospital.&quot; So I was really terrified to go. Because I knew that once I emptied into this world. That my life would be different. Forever. Because no matter what you think you have No matter what you think you have when you are told that this is it...that's different. Curtis is an intelligent individual. With him I talk about his efforts to go out on his own again to live in his house again and sometimes with his philosophical thinking which is very involved, you know, kind of deep. A little deeper, then I can completely understand. But fascinating. I have sung the music of some of the I've danced all over Europe. And I've danced everywhere in America. I performed eurythmy. Acting. I've been a teacher. I've learned four languages. I've led people through the greatest museums and galleries and landscapes in the West. From Egypt to Greece, Rome, Russia, Austria, Ireland. I covered all of Europe. [classical music] I'm called a friendly visitor. I visit people There are many people here who don't have families or whose families have given up on them or they afraid. And these people are alone and... sometimes I'm able to help these people express their feelings about being here. Or just go in and They'll talk about the lives they had before they came in here. Or sometimes they want to cry Sometimes I cry with them, you know, Or just hold the hand [classical music] This is a smoke room. We watch the patient very carefully That the cigarette don't drop on them I think I'm smoking for about...25 years. I started smoking while I was working One more and that will be it. Then I'll go there for Rivington's favorite dish: chicken. Which I must have had Two times in the last three days or three times the last three days. I don't know. Sometimes I think I smoke so I'm not hungry. I'm not a big eater right now. Let's see what's inspiring. Oh. Low and behold. Chicken. I have to eat on one side of my mouth But... I have to fear cavities. I had to have them removed. Hard to chew. This is really It's good for my Christian training. I'm no longer vain. [laughs] Now I can speak from the inner self. [laughs] But, I'm so glad They didn't have to take out my front teeth. I'm gonna get false teeth put in. I'm glad they didn't take out the teeth here. Cuz you know That's not a great feeling. It's not a great look. At least in our culture. [laughs] Most of them want to get out of here. Even if it's not realistic, they still want to get out. Do I want to go home? Yes, I do want to go home Wouldn't you? I think so. When the time is right, I will go home. People have asked me: &quot;are you afraid of death?&quot; Afraid of dying? When, I think of, like, September 11th. But for people who've been involved with the AIDS crisis, we've been living like September 11th for 20 years. Every day, bombs have been dropping invisibly. Shooting us down. Gay, straight, mothers, Different kinds of people. Millions. [Director] Looks good! [Curtis] The Godfather [friendly chatter and machines beeping] [Thunder and rain] [Classical piano starts] It's amazing how, when you come to a place like this, you really do give yourself over to the care of these people. So there's a lot of trust that's involved in this. And your body is fragile. And your mind is fragile. And your soul is fragile I do feel to be here any longer than I have to -- that if I reach that point where I have my own rhythm and physical strength -- then I'll have to go. I think I'll probably wake up tonight It's gonna be a lot of nights like that. I'll still be here. In my spirit I'll still be in the building. The last time I lived there was almost two years. Which is a long time. This is kinda like the end of Sugar Hill, It comes up by City College. It's very beautiful, City College English university architecture from the 1800s. A lot of prominent Black businessmen, lawyers, actors, entertainers, scholars populated this area. And as you come to the end of it-- This is basically the end. But the end of it is my block. Which is unique because it's a landmark area with a colonial mansion where George Washington was. I'm on the left. Keep going up. A community garden. Brownstone buildings. Start to slow up. This is my house up here. Two years living in a little tiny space. Now I have a whole mansion, Like a prince Here we go. I had an experience like the writings of James Baldwin, the Black writer who died not too long ago, when I came back from Europe. I remembered reading his books and I started to cry a lot cuz I realized the kind of Black American I am. I followed in his trails of someone who left his country Had to leave go overseas get a lot of things, experiences, that he couldn't get here. And then come back and have this richness of life. meeting wonderful people on both sides of the Atlantic and harsh experiences too. And I kinda felt in my own way I'd achieved something of what he did with my own art in my life and people I knew. But also I thought I owed something Two black birds [singing] Small hand. This belonged to a friend of mine. I painted the room while he was alive. This is a scarf that he had. In his jacket. I started painting this while he was alive. He's very sick. I used to take care of him, also. One of the few things I have left to remember him by. You see how it's very harmonious? I have been in homes where it's been stripped down. And it's incredibly beautiful of the wood, the acanthus scroll, These are all things that I grew up with. I think this must have influenced me, When I studied art as a teenager You know, so this is all playing on my mind. There are times when I I love it It's a privilege in the end. Let's be realistic. It doesn't matter where it is any place on Earth, It's a gift. And when I grew up in it, my mother often times had different groups like You know church groups or or community groups. She let them use the place for free during the week And, you know, we had children here. We had a nursery school. So, it was always filled with lots of people. So that's why the house has suffered When you're given something like this, But you want to share it with people. I would never want to just have it all, That doesn't really interest me. [classical piano] I didn't want to die before my mother did. I know this is very sad to say, Because my eldest brother died when I was 12. That was a very horrible thing. I didn't want her So, come many years later she did die first. You know, it's sad when I think about it Just for the sake of her feelings. [machines beeping] [Indistinct talking in the hall. Beeping.] I had a friend of mine. We were like the best artists He became really well-known as a Black artist and quit school to get jobs. You know, he was that good. You know, my things more European inspired, of course. So I eventually went to Europe. Then when I came back I saw him sometimes. You know. I just wanted to strike up a friendship I mean he was like into the competition thing. I wasn't. One night I was in Harlem. And I hear someone behind me on this lonely street. I turn around. And it was him. He looked kind of sick. I said &quot;Oh we should get together. I hope you're all right,&quot; you know, like that. He said &quot;Oh, I'm not feeling too great.&quot; So that was it. The next thing I knew, he died. I was walking through Harlem again at night. I walked in front of this African-American bookstore. And one of his books that's illustrated by him was in the window. It was like in the shadows. And it really kinda struck me, you know. I think, &quot;God, there's so many people dying.&quot; You know. Artists and creative people. I thought &quot;I think I should do something.&quot; [laughs] So I jumped up and grabbed my crayon [laughs] All night. [laughs] I mean just like &quot;go!&quot; I didn't look at it and say I was like &quot;next!&quot; &quot;Next!&quot; &quot;Next!&quot; &quot;Next! Next! Next!&quot; I just kept pushing pushing pushing pushing pushing. And then when I was diagnosed, I continued it. I thought &quot;well at least people look at it and go, [laughs] That's what I thought. Because if I weren't doing this You know just lying: &quot;I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm tired, I'm sick.&quot; So it's better to push that away too. You know what I mean? So the ability to create something...sometimes it's a medicine in itself. You know. It's almost like... I think AIDS is almost like...uh... a jealous personal or mean friend. It can get to you when you're tired. But when you can create something, it's like sitting in the corner going &quot;wow! I guess I can't get up now.&quot; You know like a mean person, you know. &quot;I'll wait for you next time, missy.&quot; [Laughs] &quot;I'll get you next time.&quot; [Laughs] &quot;Ah, he's creating! [Laughs] It's called immortality. I win. You know? So painting that white paint over all of that ugliness. AIDS doesn't like that. Doesn't like that. You know like when you die, including myself, And they call you in there and all the different angels, your guardian angels, they're maybe like in a business suit or something, whatever the portfolio. The other angels sitting and they go [deepens voice for the Angel] &quot;Alright Mr. Wheeler, sit down. Welcome.&quot; &quot;You're here. You're in heaven.&quot; &quot;This is purgatory by the way. You're gonna be here [Curtis's voice] &quot;Yes, I know.&quot; [Angel's voice] &quot;Um, can we get on 1986? That year. You know when you did disco, bath houses, and whatever.&quot; [Curtis's voice] &quot;Can't we look at something else?&quot; [Angel's voice] &quot;No, no. Listen we're gonna go over that we're not fast-forwarding anything.&quot; &quot;Here we go through all the tapes.&quot; I go &quot;Oh Lord!&quot; So I thought I didn't want to die because I felt, You know what I mean? &quot;Then I can die later. Let me clean it up. [orchestral music crescendos: &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;] See the thing is... With this happening, all the stuff in my legs, It can make me ugly. But it can't make my soul ugly. See, I was creating right to the end. If you walked in here, you wouldn't think You'd probably think he'd come out. You know. You wouldn't think that. Turn it into something else. All your life experiences [muffled city sounds] How about it Curtis? Hmm? Curtis is more visual. I'm more, um, The word on the page, I think. We had a lot of similarities. [coughs] And, um. Fit together like a piece. And often talked on the phone. And often about, you know, art and gossip. [laughs] [coughs] Because there are few people who can Um... Curtis certainly can. So... So, we enjoyed talking. I think that's most of our friendship has been: talk. Talking, talking, talking. Sharing ideas about things, you know. And he thinks about that stuff. You know. And then, of course, he can be very...[laughs] When he wants to be. [Laughs] [Sniffs] [Laughs] He can also be a little... [Curtis muffled] Dictatorial. Dictatorial. I guess nasty is not the word. But... [Curtis muffled] Catholic. Catholic? [Curtis laughs] No... You can just be a... When I was a little heavier than I am now Where was that pain? I said &quot;Curtis, is it around your waist?&quot; And Curtis says &quot;Yes, for those of us who have one.&quot; [both laugh] [Curtis muffled] I was just worried about you. But I lost weigh, right? I got my weight down. [laughs] And if you couldn't laugh at stuff like that, Every now and then he'll say something like that. [laughs] But it's just funny. [coughs] I hope this doesn't start bleeding. [Coughs] I should be careful. [coughs] I think I have to come back for the bone biopsy. Come on. Back to all the stuff. This stopped me in the middle of getting everything organized with my benefits. And getting the medicines right. And going to appointments. So this is a little bit of a, you know... An intrusion. But maybe it was good to have a break Trying to get back iknto normal life It's so easy to make mistakes It's very easy to slip up. Okay. Here we go. I'm lucky. That's one access here. And one up here. You see the raised bump? [groans] The world's illness is very mysterious. Convoluted dark world. And I've accepted it. My time will soon come to an end. What is it in me that wants to go on? I guess it's the will to live. So maybe I'm learning. That's something I have to learn. To have the will to live and take your destiny in your own hands. Even disciplining yourself to have time Keeping your own environment clean. These are all things that AIDS in this other way can give you. Can give you the desire to really analyze your life. And your purpose in life. [street sounds] [classical piano begins]
