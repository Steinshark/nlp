[theme music plays] [David]<i> Everyday products It's an artificial chemical that we inflicted upon [David]<i> Chemicals I would say [David]<i> What are we doing as a society [David]<i> So we're here I don't know Are you satisfied to reduce the levels? No one is ever satisfied. You keep working [David]<i> [upbeat electronic music] [David]<i> <i> trying to find products <i> that are alarming [reporter] We've heard PFAS non-stick pans, fast food wrappers, menstrual products, Anything that's marketed as rain, stain PFAS are everywhere. But trying to figure out the potentially it's almost impossible. That's why PFAS is an enormous actually up to 12,000 What they have in common is that they're all persistent, They can last for decades, [David]<i> <i> at the University of Toronto.</i> <i> She's become a crusader</i> <i> about the dangers of what The PFAS is actually going to be in the drinking water That is not a good thing. A Canadian proposal so called Cancer-causing chemicals... Harmful to the environment [David]<i> There is evidence</i> <i> the chemical companies <i> about their danger.</i> A new paper used by two of the so called They knew the harm and they didn't tell [David]<i> Nearly all of us</i> <i> already have <i> And some of these chemicals <i> to greater risk <i> lower fertility <i> a compromised immune system</i> <i> and reduced vaccine response Do we know are using PFAS in I don't know which brands [David] Because Exactly. [David]<i> Experts are concerned <i> in everyday products Why is PFAS in cosmetics? It-- it helps It helps with water repellency So if you have mascara, -it prevents it from running. How do I even know how to avoid, Because nobody tells me That's why we do testing. That's why That's why Exactly. [David]<i> So we're picking up <i> eyeliner and eyeshadow.</i> <i> Prep the samples.</i> <i> Send them for screening</i> <i>to the University of Notre Dame <i> One of the few labs <i> that routinely measures <i> a possible marker of PFAS.</i> <i> As we wait <i> we're asking Foundation, -[David] You use it all? Every single thing I go for these brands, which basically, like, What do you think about I don't like the idea I'm wondering [David]<i> Our screening flags <i> from these four brands,</i> <i> Mac, Marcelle, <i> So we're sending cosmetics <i> to a lab <i> for PFAS-specific testing.</i> So I'm just going [David]<i> It's where <i> and toxicology researcher <i> will do in-depth analysis.</i> So, next step is to add our methanol [David]<i> Testing eight products, So vortex for five minutes. [David]<i> Amy's team extracts</i> <i> both liquid and gas <i> as they look for 32</i> <i> of the most common types Okay, It's going [David]<i> <i> It takes <i> It's not just makeup.</i> <i> All sorts of consumer products <i> contain PFAS.</i> <i> Extremely persistent chemicals</i> <i> that seep <i> There are other surprising <i> Including <i> in Hamilton, Ontario.</i> This lake [David]<i> Local activist <i> about the lake's <i> from high levels So how long about the PFAS issue Well, since I first [David]<i> That's around the time <i> took a close look <i> and made It turns out that the turtles had the highest levels well, in the world [David]<i> Consuming anything <i> is not recommended.</i> [dramatic instrumental music] [David] [Joe] Okay, good. It's definitely hooked. And you got to -[David] There he is. Boy, okay, -[David] Now what's that? This is that-- that people But these fish in this lake are such-- have high levels that they really [David]<i> When fish, <i> ingest PFAS,</i> <i> it takes years <i> A toxic substance <i> Incredibly, <i> from more <i> From firefighting foam <i> used during training exercises <i> &quot;Forever chemicals&quot; indeed.</i> <i> The danger compels Joe</i> <i> to warn his community <i> As it stands, <i> and their related groups <i> though thousands more exist [Joe] that we inflicted [upbeat electronic music] [David]<i> Finally, our lab testing <i> Time to reveal the results.</i> Take a look at this table. -Tell me-- You use that one? [David]<i> -[David] Guess what? No PFAS. -[both] Okay. [David]<i> <i> None of the PFAS <i>But can't say the same for those <i> Our test finds all samples How do you feel when I tell you I don't know I'm going to have to find [David]<i> So what about</i> <i> this Marcelle This pencil? We found PFAS. Pencils too? -Yeah. -[David] Marcelle foundation? We found PFAS Wow. [David]<i> I actually use [David]<i> Turns out <i> has none of the 32 PFAS <i> Earlier tests <i> likely because <i> a mineral and a clay, <i> Next up is Mac.</i> [passerby 1] Yeah, literally -[David] Really? This Mac product [David]<i> In fact, <i> in all three Mac So what are you thinking I'm scared. [David]<i> This Mac -Yeah. [passerby 2] Huh. This Mac mascara, does not have PFAS. That's very shocking. I just didn't know about That's really wild. [David]<i> Our results,</i> <i> of the eight cosmetics <i> five contained PFAS.</i> -[indistinct] [David]<i> We take the results <i> It represents the interests</i> <i> of many makeup makers <i> Darren Praznik is the CEO.</i> What do you make of At those levels, they were not being added for any functionality, So, they were They weren't an ingredient. [David] Well, that means that can be through This is not This is not just something That-- there in the process Sources all of those things. Water, piping, materials that you've used They could be that you're using. And if it is, for example, something that raises the question, how do I eliminate that Are you satisfied when we see that everything is being done Uh, l-- listen, You keep working And the more the more we identify the more how we can get down [David]<i> Mac, Marcelle and Quo <i> as an ingredient <i> and that they follow <i> Quo tells us <i> Federal regulations <i> to test for PFAS,</i> <i> but they do forbid</i> <i> two specific <i> our test discovered We actually found in products, A company, any company, is in violation I'm not going to [David]<i> <i> in at least one sample <i> But he points out <i> as an ingredient, <i> during Its presence doesn't necessarily Would you use I would say If you put, for example, you've got a high probability are just going to or through a tear duct. Same with eyeliner. Foundations, the PFAS can transfer into your-- into your body. Lipstick of being So when you put lipstick on, that you're going to be The science that we shouldn't be Do you feel to get as low as possible? Well, everyone has an urgency, but everyone In most cases, they're gone. Alternatives [David]<i> He's calling on <i> a maximum <i> in makeup That seems to be that we now know PFAS -in some forms can be dangerous. How do you even know what to use It's so difficult to know. So what I do, And that clue is that as being water resistant. Wear forever, durable. &quot;Put it on So those are -That could be a tell.

[David]<i> Forcing him They're looking you knowing that And you're killing them. You didn't make PFAS. No, I didn't. So this-- this would all be So that roll that whole roll is all of those hundred [David] Yeah, yeah. So you get ...a grave [David] My wife and I qualify and all this other stuff, and food stamps, -You've worked your entire life. Not-- not, like, you've worked Yep. Yep. [David] And now, because of you're relying State aid. Yep. Yep.

I'm scared You have And I think one thing chemicals in general is that during it can be That has got to be That's terrifying. Yeah, no-- no parent with this kind of What are we doing putting our children by lacing everyday products and then using to fertilize our food?

[David]<i> Maine <i> By 2030, PFAS will be banned Do you think other jurisdictions Canada, for instance? Well, my hope is that this is a wake up call who may not have been to just how significant this kind of [David]<i> It is a call <i> scientific community <i> Including <i> who wants to see Not voluntary measures.
