Hello friends, Wow Kitchen here! Today we have a hearty, rich soup and it's great autumn, of course. For me yes. In our family, there is nowhere without hot food. Place a frying pan on the fire, top it with vegetable or melted butter, you can even use lard, whatever you have, friends. Let it melt, I already cooked the broth yesterday, so today I have the quickest and easiest thing left. I cut one small onion into a small cube, I will have a three-liter pan, so it will be enough. It's ready, and I don't wait for anything, I immediately put it in the pan. Let everything begin to make friends here - a little salt, a pinch of sugar. I stir. Autumn gives us such beautiful sweet peppers, I cut them into strips. And right away I'll cut a small piece of tomato next to it - it's left over from breakfast, don't throw it away. Everything will come in handy on the farm, of course. I'm keeping an eye on the onions. Oh, it's already beautiful here, it's even starting to brown. Add pepper and tomato and fry. A delicious soup is a tasty roast. In the meantime, these vegetables are fried, I'll take care of the beets: I'll grate them. I have it in Korean, that's how I want it today. If you just grate it, you'll end up with a boiled mess. You can, of course, and yet I want this today for my beloved husband. Thank you, sunshine. You're welcome, I missed you, of course. Can't you see it? It can be seen, it has clearly blossomed. Come on, Seryozha, it's time to mix the vegetables and add the beets. I heat everything together until the beets reduce in volume. In the meantime, I'll get to the broth. Here I have a leg or a homilka, as is correct. Oh, how overcooked it was. Look how both the jellied meat and the broth have congealed overnight. I had to boil it, then I would trim the meat and strain the broth. Oh, what a leg. That's it, carrot - let's leave it there. There is such a thing, let it cool down a little. Oh, let's go. After a few minutes I add one good tablespoon of tomato paste. You can, of course, replace it with tomato juice - either will do. What is it? I love Chernyavy. Burnt. Yes, a little bit. I'm still a failure, yes, yes, I've been staring at you. Well, it's okay, it will be tastier - everything will dissolve in the broth, and you will lick your fingers. I won't warm it up for too long, as long as it just sticks a little. That's it, I'm taking it off the heat. Help? Come on, of course, hold the strainer over the castle, Seryozha, and where am I? I strain it - that will be enough. Uh-huh, give it here. Yeah, I put it on the fire and lay out the frying. Oh, neat. Well, wash the frying pan, Seryozha. Well, this is the law, of course, my frying pan. And there's less work for you too. Okay, I'll do everything, but then I wipe it with a cloth - that's all. Well, of course. And here, and immediately into the pan, I grate one boiled potato. You can, of course, also raw. We just have leftovers from yesterday's lunch, so we can't let the goodness go to waste. It's all in, right here. The main thing is that it will be delicious. That's it, I cover it with a lid. Let it start to boil. Show me how beautiful it is? After boiling, I let the broth simmer a little. Cauliflower - I separate it into inflorescences like this. Oh, I think this will be enough for me, and with my other half I'll come up with something for dinner. Maybe we'll make a delicious casserole. Yes, yes, I like the ones you make in the oven. Yeah, we just need an oven. So, let's go buy it. A little smaller so that it looks nice and fits into your mouth. I put it in a bowl and fill it with water - it needs to be washed and so that all the bugs crawl out, if there are any there. And I'm still pruning. You tell me what kind of thing. Yes, no one in our family ate cauliflower at all before. I did not accept it in any form. And then in the comments they suggested: make battered cabbage, cauliflower. And we tried. Yes, and from that moment on, casseroles, salads, pancakes, and just grilled are delicious. That's it, let it stand a little. I drain the water and add the cabbage to the soup. And then immediately the meat that I found on that leg. It is so tender and delicious. To be honest, I ate half of it myself while Seryozhka was away. Did you eat meat without me ? Seryozha, you know, friends, I took a piece of boiled meat. Yes, a cucumber, a tomato - I ate it with such pleasure, and it's a shank, the meat is tender, so delicate. Let it boil well. Right away, friends, let's take a good bunch of greens from the garden. Yes, this is what I have - sorrel, parsley, green onions. By the way, you were right, the parsley came back and became as good as new. Let's cut it, I won't chop it up, because it's greens - oh, what a beauty. Let's look at our soup. Oh, it boiled well, look how beautiful and bright it is. I want, so that the cabbage remains a little crispy. Well, we love it so much, friends, so I boil it for exactly 2 minutes and add herbs. Oops, in the pan. After this soup you will want to stay close to your wife at home forever. Immediately add salt to taste, add some spicy sensations for my husband - more pepper, more. I bought you enough red stuff there, Seryozha. I stir. It boiled well, it's really bubbling for me. Cover with a lid and turn off the heat, let it brew for at least 10-15 minutes. And during this time, friends, now I'll show you this. Seryozhka always scolds me for this: Anya, did you cut all the bread again while you were bringing it from the store? Yes, friends, since childhood I have had this habit: when I buy bread and take it home, I make sure to gnaw on all the edges - it's crispy and tasty. I also have a habit of breaking bread. I love, you know, breaking off the stuff and eating it. Seryozha doesn't really like it, but he's already used to it. But where to go? Well, yes. Now let me make you a delicious lazy donut from this piece? Yes, yes, come on, come on, I love you. Friends, I do all this in a bowl. I mix a little garlic salt and a teaspoon of green paste. All the recipes, friends, are on the channel, I will leave the links in the description. I have aromatic vegetable oil, a teaspoon and about one to two tablespoons of water. I mix everything well. Ready! We take the bread and make cuts - even if it falls apart, it's not scary. Oh, that's what I got. It's obvious, right, Seryozha? It's obvious. I take the aromatic mixture and grease the bread, trying to get into every cell. I just haven't forgotten what it's called. Oh, come here so it's filling and tasty. Now I want to distribute it all, Seryozha, so that it gets into every cell. Oh, and I'll butter it up a little here. I transfer it to a plate and put it in the microwave. Op, cover on top, 1-2 minutes. Let's get it. Wow, wow, how soft it is, look at how fluffy it is! And how fragrant. Oh, and a red pepper for you. Thank you, sunshine. And now the soup! Oh, wow, what a soup, look what a soup it turned out to be! Light and at the same time very satisfying, because our broth is made with beef and is so powerful. That's how, Seryozha, I taught you first courses without potatoes. Like it, friends! Oh, and, as usual, meat for yourself. Yes, Seryozha, well, I don't know how it happens, it's just my luck! That's for sure, seriously, it's just my luck. Well, do you want me to switch plates with you? Of course, we'll change, why did I say this... And, of course, we have homemade sour cream, my neighbor gave it to me, I thank her. And here! Like, friends, and we'll have lunch. Will you try it? Of course, I'll start. Well, yes, what a beautiful spoon I have. I'll stir the sour cream - I love seasoned soups and borscht. Well, I'm trying... Oh, I don't even know what to say. Do you know why? Because it's very tasty! Let me try it now, friends, it's very tasty - crispy beetroot and crispy cabbage, I'm sure. Well, come on, let me try! Come on, come on, of course. Well, let's get off my plate, Seryozh. Well, it's delicious! I'll blow... Well, blow, you're already an adult. Anechka, I really thank you for the delicious treats that you prepare for me. Please! Try the bun, and let's all go together, it's delicious, friends, delicious. Tell! That's it, take my plate, take it with the meat. Yes, because it contains meat, you understand, right? And most importantly, I want to wish everyone happiness, health, love, peaceful skies, and prosperity! Family is when they look in one direction and go towards the same goal. Yes, this is a real family. Yes, so, honey, thank you. Please! We wish you all health, happiness and prosperity. This is my plate! Well, okay, I'll choose this one for myself. That's it, let's eat! Do you want to eat? Yes, let's eat. Are you asking me? Yes, you are asking me! Speak. She's talking, Verochka. Will you eat? Do you want to eat? Look, she got up on her paws - she wants to! I saw the phone. Well, go to mom. Will you? Will you, my dear? Kitty, pour half a portion. It smells so good! I ate it myself, Vera, but I'll give it to you. If you do, I'll stroke you too. Or should I give you a bowl? Bon appetit! Tasty? Well, of course it's delicious!
