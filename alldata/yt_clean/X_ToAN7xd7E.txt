*Somewhere in the Wild South *Landmines [Geese honk] The battle for the islands marked the entire year of 2023. [Shooting sounds] [Drone engine sound] [Shooting sounds] [Mortar incoming explosion sound] A Special Operations Forces' task force was rapidly deployed to the Kherson direction. *See you in Kherson If we were detected by the enemy, our mission was to eliminate them. [Music is playing] Grenade launcher, M4, RPG tube. [Music is playing] [Boat engine start sound] [Music is playing] We were crossing over from the settlement... Maybe I should tell you in order? Whoever controls the islands can then create bridgeheads on the other side. For us, that's the Dnipro River's east bank, *Call sign Sheriff, The islands are there. The (russians) are beyond the islands. Our initial tasks were reconnaissance, To clear the wetlands... *Call sign Cowboy And, if we encounter the enemy, to eliminate them. In other words, to create favorable conditions for establishing and setting the stage for a full-fledged capture We often crossed rivers behind enemy lines, [Incoming artillery explosion sounds] Here, we faced a stretch of open water between 800 and 900 meters. It wasn't a secret for us those circumstances that wasn't exactly our major specialization. We had some groundwork for this. we conducted training exercises on rivers, The second point is that the selection process for our unit, [Diving into water sounds] One of the criteria for joining a team In general, we were given some leeway time-wise, The Netherlands serves as the ideal training course. *Three Amigos They gave you a task in the morning, By night, you're already out executing it. and suddenly--boom, there's a new task, a new mission. Yes, it was exhausting back then, We were fully prepared for this kind of work when we got to Kherson. [Inaudible speaking] SOF! SOF! [Branches crackling sound] [boat boarding sounds] Thanks to the good selection and training of our personnel, Retraining a Humvee driver for a boat operator in just two days was real. We were a bit stunned by the whole situation. *Drivers/Boat operators But an order is an order. First, we went to a neighboring unit to see how it works. Then, within just a few days, *The way to Krynky [Music is playing] - Go ahead Prepare to comply with the task. - Listen, we need to move the extraction by half an hour. - They're texting electronic warfare will be active in our zone. [Music is playing] Damn, it's like you're smoking flashlights instead of cigarettes. [Music is playing] - And when will they be working? -- If there are no changes, we'll push it back. - Launch a mission, launch a mission. During our crossing, drones in the sky streamed live to our command. If someone fell out of the boat or something happened, the coordination from the air would help The trenches weren't deep enough, as we couldn't dig them, and the shell landed in an inconvenient spot. When crossing, we've got into the boat, [Music is playing] I'll tell you, it's harder on a boat than in a Humvee. It can be a one-way trip and don't get your armor off in time, you'll just sink like a stone. He was peeing there, in front of us, - Here, bro. Hold on. - No, it deploys the moment you fall into the water. A Humvee is still a vehicle; When you are on a boat, And the moment when you're hiding behind the inflatable, We knew exactly what needed to be done. because of the vast stretch of open water. When you're crossing, you don't know if you're heading straight for a machine gun or (enemy) position.Something could hit you from above, a grenade launcher, shooting from another bank.so we tried to approach from the side. When you see a watermelon floating in the Dnipro River, It's not a f***ing watermelon. It's a naval mine. If you hit it, After the Kakhovka Dam explosion, everything got washed away, and everything was mixed together. These naval mines were floating all over the river, *Call sign Dynamite, Blue units were actively demining, using drones, [Seagulls squawking sounds] Disembarking is probably the hardest part. You spend a lot of energy just trying to make that first landing. Another team met us on the other side. They came to meet us at the water... Damn, they're rushing fast. We approached the pier to see half of it was flooded. As we moved, some team members began falling into the water because we were carrying huge backpacks, We needed to haul them. [Music is playing] - Come on, man, move quickly. - Alright, good luck! The water temperature drops to 6-8 degrees Celsius (c. 45 F), so we disembarked in our old shoes, clothes and headed to shore At night, we changed into dry clothes and waited for dawn. (Who cares about) changing clothes now? There's no time. They'll start shelling us now, f***! In the dark, we made our way to the island near Krynky village. Our task was to clear the sector and It was also important to know what was happening directly on the islands, as they had very dense vegetation, and even drones equipped with thermal imaging The woods and observation posts were not visible; [Music is playing] It seems the (orc) was lying down, observing the woods. [Music is playing] For the first time in the war, I encountered a situation where it was so quiet, artillery didn't fire at all. For those who understand, we didn't even dig trenches; we just slept in the bushes on sleeping mats and sleeping bags. We knew it was very safe, It might be several days without sleep. The first night, we moved around with night vision gear. The noise. If a team moves, it is very audible. [Crickets chirping sound] [Steps in the woods sound] [Crickets chirping sound] - What tasks do we need to comply with? - It appears we are behind enemy lines. We hear them very damn good. [Crickets chirping sound] As Special Operations Forces, we do not capture and hold lodgements or positions. Because our resources are quite limited. However, the &quot;bite and run&quot; tactic worked excellently there. We made it on the second day after moving all night. We spotted an enemy observation post, observing it. We lined up, keeping watch over their observation post, when one of the enemies poked his head out. I said, &quot;Good evening, we are from Ukraine,&quot; Then skirmish started. [Shooting sounds] We quickly fired into their tents. We even asked them to surrender three times. They started coming out. They were heavily wounded, bleeding. They had no chance. One of them was not wounded. - Come here. Who took you as a prisoner of war? - The Ukrainian army took me as a POW. - An hour ago. - I was sleeping. I showed my hands, - Wave a hand, f***! - We're working. It happens sometimes, right? [Music is playing] - Can you hear me? Over! [Music is playing] They are coming. [Music is playing] - Fine, you get in, then throw the POW. - Hi! We came here as we were told. - They said to get there. - Give me the machine gun. [Boat engine sound] After interrogating the POW, we managed to clarify the outline of the enemy's line, their observation posts system, and their communication system. It appeared a new (enemy) team got in. It turns out we followed their path, And got in after them. We cut off about 15 meters of that wire to sever their communication. [Steps and cutting wire sound] At one point, all the interceptions suddenly (disappeared). [Bad TV signal sound] It seems they realized something wrong with the field phone and went to check what had happened. - We just waited until they got as close as ten meters. (Orcs) were so relaxed, they even had two people there, - They were so comfortable in this land, Initially, everything was going smoothly for them, You could even set your watch by their schedule. So, we started searching... *Fire support team ... For these river crossings, logistical hubs, and enemy assets and personnel. Our drone pilots have done a great job. Yes, the senior artillery commander had very limited But even with these limited capabilities, - The most extreme moment. - Be careful. [Sound of drone loading] [Sounds of steps] [Drone airscrew running sound] [Car doors closing sound] - So, what now? - Until it arrives where it's supposed to? - It's supposed to arrive. We hope so. - Does it drop by itself? - What a great independent performer. [Music and sounds of explosion] Our fire support team worked very effectively. When we arrived, we worked with company-level units on request. What was that? Targeting and suppression *For all Ukrainians We left at night and located signatures on the islands. There were three of us, - How did you get off the boat and move around or how? Just try to make it work. I don't know, Or some kind of stuff. - Yes, they take a 60-mm mortar. At night, we preferred not to shoot and reveal our position, the guys delivered there a few mines with the coordinates we had, controlled the fire. Yes, they hit it. We hit, according to the interceptions. Fire! [Mortar fire sound] Gradually, we started to hit their logistics routes and changes. We spotted one crossing, then another, [Music is playing] [Music and sounds of explosion] [Mortar fire sound] [Music and sound of explosion] We managed to destroy more than a dozen of the enemy's boats. From the interceptions, we learned that they were having supply problems. They were simply filtering river water through a five-liter bottle, stuffing it with cotton and bandages, and drinking it. The muddy green water. They were cooking with and drinking it. They had watering holes for chasers. They had places to fill the water near the Basanka River. - Are wasting them? [Whisper sound] - I'm taking the one with the bucket. - We knew there were definitely two of them, But they ended up being four. - Although not for long. - Yes, Panda was there. Panda was some kind of figure, not a minor one - The third one came here. The third one. - The one was staying ang peeing. And says I am so exhausted. I thought, &quot;Just wait, wait.&quot; [Shooting sounds] The intercepts revealed that he was assigned But it only lasted two days. F***! [Steps in the woods sound] Among the destroyed enemy servicemen, Well, welcome to Ukraine. We went back to take pictures of them. Our task was to cross the Basanka River, We are working. Attention! [Whisper sounds] Radio talks: Roger that! Go! [Grenade launcher firing sounds] Two outcomings. A day before, we had to (shell) the area with artillery By the way, there's a video where I'm ready to go onto the island while our artillery is (shells the sector) beforehand. [Birds tweeting sounds] [Birds tweeting sounds] Swans are flying. We started the operation a 7 am. One team approached the shore and sat there for about 2-3 hours, just listening. [Music is playing] We could hear the russians talking on that side. If any unforeseen circumstances arose, Our fire support team would heavily bombard That could be included (on the video) as well. [Music is playing] Quiet, quiet, quiet... [Music is playing] Upon landing on the shore, we spotted the enemy. Ordinary infantry wouldn't assault those rivers. They retreated. On our side, there was no point As we had just landed on the riverbank, We came to the (russians) as well. We cleared the area and found several machine gun positions. And wherever we came, we saw that likely after the moment we crossed the river, everything in this part of the island was abandoned. [Music is playing] While one of our teams moved in to clear the island, [Steps in the woods sound] An American M249 (machine gun). What a menu: A full backpack of ammo, and more. I think if they start breaking in here, Before Krynyky village, there was another water body, It was mined with directional type of anti-personnel landmines, bounding fragmentation anti-personnel landmines, And directional type of anti-personnel landmines with tripwires. I'm walking, and I hear my foot dragging something on the ground. I turn around and see I'm dragging an RGD-5 grenade on a wire. I pulled a tripwire, and it didn't explode, f***. My stomach went cold because I realized what it was. What saved me was that it was poorly set up It wasn't wired to a tree but just taped with electrical tape. Since it had been raining, it got soggy, and I just dragged it with me. [Steps in the woods sound] - Nobody's there? - I'm telling you, it hit right here. - What's new you have there? - You'll go to the village (wearing it) Or the second one, for mom for the market. [Fabric rustling sound] [Steps in the woods sound] - Where are the others? - Roger that! [Children's counting rhymes] [Music is playing] [The sound of cutting metal wire] We needed to understand what was around the island from all sides. We drew a map, assessed the situation, and figured out which side was the safest for us. - Archaeologists, have you (lost your minds)? - We're digging a tunnel. - (A tunnel) to Krynky. - Dig like a grandpa dug! But the grandpa dug (like hell). - That's two rivers, that's f***!. - And then they'll say to cross a third one. - Like this, Roger? Yesterday was the best day of my life, [Branches cracking sound] - The (russians) are coming; shoot them. I said, shoot! [Laughter] - Did you hear that? [Laughter] - Repeat. I've slept a few hours a day for the past three days. [Birds tweeting sounds] - You fall asleep right away or sit and start hallucinating. - XXX wakes us up in the middle of the night and says, I thought I was hallucinating. We woke up at 01:45 am to find a drone floating quietly on the river, about 200 meters away. - A rat sits there. - It's crawling. A big-haired mouse. Mice. They get everywhere. They chew through our gear, and bother the people. - What stood out? Caterpillars and tits that know how to attack people. It was difficult to reconnoiter that area because of making it hard to move quietly [Music is playing] [Steps in the woods sounds] Depending on the conditions, we walked approximately 16-25 km (10-15 miles) in one day. [Woods sounds] [Music is playing] We were in armor with helmets A massive consumption of water This included combat gear, individual protection, It was a severe test for the personnel. In the first days, it was all about carrying everything with you, but later, you could just bring supplies as needed. - That moment when the goodies are being delivered. [Music is playing] - Leave some for us. - I say, did they take all the bread? - That's all (we have). [Plastic wrapper rustling sounds] The Humvee drivers who switched for the boats delivering supplies to us - What's our job? To deliver from point A to point B and help if needed. And then bring them back from point B to A. To ensure they are all safe. We helped... the guys led them to the points on foot, There's a guy in our battalion who takes care of supplies in a team. He's a person who deals with paperwork, organization, and office work. But when we were crossing the river, the man stood in waders almost three hours in the middle of the river. He was at risk of getting shot because he was moving the boats from one side to the other. - [Whispers] - Have a good day! I know you'll be watching this, It was either intuition or experience. something told me and my combat buddy Literally, a day later, that building was gone. A gliding bomb just hit. It must have been about 500 kg (1,102 lbs) or a metric ton (2,204 lbs). Around 110 KAB bombs hit this small sector in one day. A few times, it also landed near us. Quite an interesting feeling. We'd done the rotations then, and thanks God, [Sound of woods] - Yes. Any loss is sensitive for us, it's a deep pain for our unit. Training cannot always be protected against all scenarios. After capturing the lodgement at Krynky, the intensity of combat operations A truly (intense) shelling has began around 03:15. I started hearing a rush, saw red flashlights, Dugouts were not high enough because they were difficult to dug. The mortar fired. It hit under the helmet, and one shrapnel piece We provided assistance until the very end, and began evacuation. We immediately relayed the information to our operational officers on the other bank that we had a WIA, and passed on all relevant information. A thick fog covers the Dnipro River in the pre-dawn hours, and our boat, which had gone out on the river, reported, &quot;Guys, we've stopped in the middle of the Dnipro River. We don't know where we're drifting At that moment, call sign XXX said that YYY had already died, that he was no longer breathing. We advised them not to hurry. Somehow, the evacuation team on the boat When we returned to base and began sorting through his belongings, we found that he had a (written) will. This shows the level of professionalism of the person who, even while going on such operations, prepared a will. In my understanding, if I were to die, I probably wouldn't care much about what happens afterward. Life would be over. But this person The enemy had heavily mined the area. it was, of course, impossible to fully protect ourselves from landmines. We spotted another observation post and, well, Yes... and, well... we cleared it. - The thing is, it was also mined. with call sign YYY in the center, and we were on the flanks, so we got fewer shrapnel fragments. But I got hit so badly that all four of my limbs were injured, and I couldn't open the tourniquet from the Velcro I just took up my position and covered my sector with my rifle. Later, the guys ran up to me and applied the tourniquet. This is the reality of war. We had just lost a combat buddy, Everyone understood that the patrol base we were previously on was compromised and that we had lost a combat buddy. We had to (work a lot) for the next 3-4 days We needed to gather as many Marines as possible It took us two nights to meet them, brief them on the situation, provide all the necessary information, and guide them to their positions, - When drones (fly), you're hiding, Similarly, when you hear a bird, Orlan drone, On a quiet, calm night, unlike now when it's wet and dry, you don't always need to keep looking. You just listen. Later on, through our island, and our route was used for its further supply It's worth noting that our buddies from the Territorial Defense Forces greatly helped us by providing support with their watercraft at that time. Our combat buddies, call signs TTT and RRR, The last rotations and the last push into the zone were tough because everyone feared getting killed or wounded in action. - [Whispering] We'll be heading home soon. [Sounds of woods] [Whispering] Some are still having dinner. - Thank you! It was also uncomfortable and, to some extent, frightening to cross the water in the reverse direction. When you're returning, you gather at one point again. We had to get in and out quickly because there was a chance the (russians) might be aware of our landing. Only four of us left as we sent the entire team off. There was a boat. I heard the sound of a mortar firing, heard the whistle, and saw a mortar shell fall into the water just a meter behind him. [Sounds of mortar fire] We froze. I said, "Come on, jump, dude," The boat started, moved away, [Sound of incoming explosion] We now have experience and skills - They used to say that crossing the Dnipro River was a task for the (killed in action). F*** it! Two rivers. [Sound of explosion] Of course, it's always gratifying to liberate It's a special pride for any serviceman. [Music is playing] - The scent of home. Over there. [Laughter] [Boat engine sound] [Handshakes and cheers sounds] [Music is playing] I want to give a shoutout to the Odesa Special Forces School. It produces real warriors. I was very pleased to work with our people. They are highly motivated to bring death to the russians, day or night, in any weather. - [Whispering] The nature is wonderful, the island is beautiful, the air is fresh. The Ukrainian (MRE) is great. And most importantly, the company is amazing. - And I'll say one more thing. The main rule of life: It's great everywhere with these guys. [Music is playing] *To all our brothers-in-arms who sacrificed their lives for Ukraine [Music is playing]
