Today, I'm conducting the like surviving this giant flood, shrinking village and literally colliding But first, we're going to morph these mobs together to see Oh, wow. I choose Spider-Man. - I'm going with the Zombie Ghast. Which leaves me with the creeper Begin. All right, Zombie Ghast, let's go. Oh, he's shooting stuff. Oh wow. There's no way my Spider Enderman Oh wow. Oh my god. That's unfair. Dude, he's dodging the Ghast shots. Spider-Man is getting wrecked. - No! I took out the spider Enderman. Oh. Wait, that was sick. Really? Why my guy? It is between the Zombie Ghast Who's going to win? I don't know. Oh, my God. He deflected one back. Yes! You guys let me pick last. And I still got the points. Leaving me with one point And whoever ends up with the least Walmart in a gorilla costume I hate doing that. Then you better pick correctly when we see between these massive mega TNT - I'm going with the big TNT. - I got to go with the black hole I feel like black - And big TNT's have? Let's do this. Oh my gosh. Look at this. How much of the city Wait, what is happening? - Oh, it's shooting little TNT. I didn't know It's a big city Come on. Leave nothing. Oh, it's spinning faster. One and a half billion blocks - What? I'm backing up. Guys! Back up! Oh my God! 2.12 million blocks destroyed. All right, purple. Let's see if we can beat that. Let's see what this black hole TNT It's smaller than I remember, to be honest. But it's not about size Oh, what? It's absolutely always about size. If I would have known I would have chose differently. Oh, yeah. Yes. It's taken all the blocks. That's why I went black hole. - It's taking the entire building. Oh my God. But it's only up All part of my plan. Come on. Please. Oh, no. Oh! Oh, wow. Get to work, man. Nolan, this isn't looking good. Oh, this is going to be close. No no no no no no no. 2 million blocks and it's still going. Oh, yeah. Oh, we don't even have to watch It's already past 2.5 leaving me with two points. Purpled with one and Wally and Nolan with I'm unhappy. Up next, we brought out - Oh my gosh! And two Tesla coils that are going to launch a bunch How many lightning bolts to defeat it? All right, I think it's going to be I think it'll be 2500. I think it's going to be 750 I think it's going to be 2501 - Oh, wait. Begin. - No! I'm not going to lie. Well, We'll be fine. Look at all that with these things. Your guess of 750 is not looking Oh my God. Oh, no. It's about to go crazy. Oh my gosh. Electricity to the max. What am I looking at right now? No, it's halfway point it's like 2000. Oh, I might win. Oh, jeez. Wow. It's gonna be about 4000, Keep living, buddy, for 3000 Yeah. Die! 4000 strikes. Wait, Nolan, Guess who's not walking around Right now it's looking like Wally's what size gorilla costume he wears.
