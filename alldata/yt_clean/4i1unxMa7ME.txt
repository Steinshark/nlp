I don't think so. What happened to Benny An accident. We should simply of why these things happen. You gonna write - Do you feel that crashing was inappropriate in any way? - His mother was that this was not an accident, and that's why she's bringing - So you blame the - Yes. No. - Yes? No? Care to clarify? - She just shoulda known - So you don't feel that any - When I get rid of then everybody The administration the people will see the truth, and hopefully you see - Let me get this straight.

Your honor. (gavel banging) - Calling to order the case The plaintiff, Miss Robinson, sues in the amount of $1. - My son was a who kept his nose to the He had friends, he had family, He also had hypertrophic a condition that we would had it not been for Coach that unfairly-- These are not-- - [Judge] Mr. Trenton, please. Please. - [Vick] Okay. - You've been advised and you're free to speak There's no need to - Oh. Okay. But that's not fair, right? - You're right, it was Now, Miss Robinson, without the objectionable - This man is at fault I could sue him for a It wouldn't matter to me. Because when he loses this case, he'll never hurt anyone again. Because he'll never coach again. And he'll finally understand to lose something that he loves. - [Judge] Does the defendant - Benny's loss has been I never thought like this could happen. Did you ever even come - Your honor, I would like - Please do, Miss Robinson. - Would you say a practice entirely of sprints? - No, ma'am. - So what was the reason - 'Cause me and three of - So this was a - Yes, ma'am. - Was Benny one of - Yes, ma'am. - Your honor, while the sprints I argue that they were increased due to the aggression and only at this stage - [Judge] Duly noted. - That's the problem these days. It's discipline, not aggression. Life is all about discipline. You know that, judge. A kid should respect it. And when I get a player who hadn't been taught any the only way I'm gonna is with law and order. - Yeah, you tell 'em, coach. - Mr. Trenton, you do realize Nor are you a police officer? You're a high school - If Mr. Trenton felt that by insubordination would that be something forget about? - Um, he would stamp it out. - At the cost of - Give it a rest. You think I'd let somebody die Tell 'em, Greg. You've worked with me for years. Tell 'em how I feel Go ahead, tell 'em. - Well, I mean, you'd rather than kick a field goal. But this was a level - Did you observe the struggling with these sprints? - Yeah, but it wasn't after that much runnin'. - [Vick] That's right. - [Judge] And did you feel - I felt they were - [Judge] Did you express - [Greg] Yes. - [Theresa] And - Um, he ignored me. - How long thereafter - It was the next gasser. - Really? - [Vick] That was the last one. - [Theresa] You - Yes, I can. That was the last - I don't remember - [Theresa] Your honor, I would like to call - [Judge] You're excused. Sir, you're excused. - [Theresa] Did you end - [Mark] Yes. - [Theresa] What happened then? - I stopped because I counted, and we kept going, - Why did he keep them going? - 'Cause he wanted - [Theresa] Did you? - No. - So if you were the why did the entire team - 'Cause he'll do anything - Even at the cost (discordant music) - Um, yes. - [Theresa] No further Plaintiff rests. - You're excused. - I don't feel any better.

Why don't you believe me when - Because you don't know When Benny's father left, I paid the bills, I raised him to have a future. And when you invest that you know when they're You watch them, protect them. You don't keep blowing a damn - So it's just revenge, huh? - He kept spending more and I raised him just so he exhausted, and then and waste his time I raised him just so you - I didn't take him from you. - I am doing this to protect other parents in the world (door slamming) - Mr. Trenton, I don't know you, but I've in all my years There's nothing wrong but there is something wrong to the needs of That is called negligence, However, evidence does not show that the defendant's negligence was the direct cause The plaintiff's evidence and objectionable to I find the defendant, Case closed. - Thank you, your honor.
