[George Matsumoto: Hi everyone, I'm George We've been working with our colleagues at the Monterey Bay Aquarium to help them bring the deep sea to land in a new exhibition, Into the Deep: Exploring And when it opens, you'll encounter some and rarely seen animals ever featured in an aquarium exhibition. So here they are! These are the Aquarium's top 10 favorite deep-sea animals. [Text on screen: 10 - Mauve stinger] [MacKenzie Bubel: Aquarium Biologist] The mauve stinger is a beautiful, small, voracious predator of a jelly. It is pink and purple and gold, and it's gorgeous, but it also is deadly. It can sting any type of prey item, not only on its tentacles, but also, it can sting on its bell. I've personally only seen I find it very unique and interesting. [Tommy Knowles: Aquarium Biologist] The mauve stinger is you'll encounter when They're just a really interesting animal with a variety of behaviors that will be on display. [Text on screen: 9 - Basket Star] [Ellen Umeda: Aquarium Biologist] When I look at basket stars, I'm just kind of amazed, because they have so many arms and so many little appendages coming off. [Alicia Botondo: Aquarium Biologist] It looks very Tim Burton-esque. It's sort of like They uncurl their arms in a very slow, dramatic way. [MacKenzie] They can put their arms up and down in the water column to try to catch krill or any type of little meaty snacks that they can find in the deep sea. [Ellen] It just makes me think, how do they not get Because there's just so much going on! [Text on screen: 8 - Salmon snailfish] [Dalton Richardson: Aquarium Biologist] The salmon snailfish is sort of this tadpole-looking creature. They have these huge eyes and a couple little trailing bits under their chin. [Alicia] Instead of using to look for food, they actually are using their fins. [Mary McCarthy: Aquarium Biologist] It kinda looks like a beard on their chin, and they can use that to [Alicia] They're able to which are kinda like little hands, to touch the floor and find the food. And then once they taste something, then they will bend down and eat it. [Ellen] That's something very often in this animal world. [Text on screen: 7 - Predatory Tunicate] [Alicia] Predatory tunicates are an extremely unusual animal. [MacKenzie] They look stuck right to the sea floor. [Mary] They wait for something to swim in and then they close the mouth and wait for the food to be digested. More like, you might [Alicia] I think they look kind of like one of the pirana flowers from Mario, like the the flower that just (gulping), kinda does that (makes grabbing gesture). [Text on screen: 6 - Bone-eating worm] [Tommy] Everything in the deep sea is used by animals trying to survive in one of the harshest environments on the planet. [MacKenzie] There's even to eat the bones of the whales that have been on the bottom. [Ellen] There aren't very many animals out there that have the ability to break down bone and then use that as a food source. [Mary] Bone worms look just sticking out of the bone, but they're way more complex than that. They have acid that they secrete in order to burrow into the bone. And then they're also have a bacteria that live inside of them, and the bacteria is what actually digests the bone and creates nutrients that the bone worm can then use. It's very complicated. For such a little thing. [Text on screen: 5 - Japanese spider crab] [Tommy] We've all seen crabs before, but you probably have not seen crabs like the Japanese spider crab. They are huge! [Dalton] There are reports that get up to the size if that gives people context for the size and sheer enormity of this species. [Alicia] It's a little unnerving when your animals are taller than you. [MacKenzie] They really make you think, if this exists on the bottom of the ocean, what else exists on that we haven't seen yet? [Text on screen: 4 - Common siphonophore] [Mary] Siphonophores don't look like they should be alive. (laughs) They just look like odd conglomerations of cellophane that somehow [MacKenzie] They are a colonial organism, which is an organism and I think many [Ellen] It's actually a collection of multiple little animals called zooids, and each of these little zooids has a specific function as a whole, survive. [MacKenzie] And they all work together. It's like a little spaceship with all the people on it, all working together for a common goal. [Tommy] Siphonophores have never really been displayed in aquariums, so this is really new And we're really excited to bring this totally unique-looking and introduce them to one of the coolest species in the deep sea! [Text on screen: 3 - Sea angel] [MacKenzie] I love sea angels. They're a unique, little tiny snail that does not have a shell, that's swimming around the ocean. [Tommy] They have tiny little fins on the side of their body that make them look like little angels. [Alicia] The way that sea [Ellen] But one little that you wouldn't expect is they're voracious predators. [Sound of a needle scratching [MacKenzie] Really, it can [Tommy] When it's time to feed, their mouth opens on the top of their head and these devilish jaws come out to attach onto certain species of sea butterfly that they prey on. [Ellen] So these cute little animals, they're called sea angels but they're actually vicious predators. [Text on screen: 2 - [Alicia] Giant deep-sea isopods look exactly like pill bugs on land, but they're huge! [Mary] You can have isopods that are like maybe a millimeter long. And then you have a deep-sea isopod, which is like the size of a football. [MacKenzie] Giant deep-sea equal part nightmare to wild imagination fantasy. [Mary]Food isn't readily and so deep-sea isopods have adapted to eat as much as they can, and then they may not until they find another large meal. [Dalton] I have this theory that everybody either loves them or hates them. I find that their little faces just look like they're kind of plotting something. Like, I don't know, they just look like they're up to something! [Text on screen: 1 - [Ellen] The bloody-belly comb jelly is one of the coolest [Dalton] They have this [Alicia] Sunlight entering the ocean is going to slowly be lost as go deeper and deeper into the water. The first color that you lose is red. And so a lot of animals in the deep sea tend to be red. When we shine a light on them, we think it looks very obvious, but in the dark, red makes you pretty much invisible in the deep sea. [MacKenzie] There's in the deep sea, so you kind of have to have the ability to camouflage yourself if you're a deep sea animal. [MacKenzie] The sparkly rainbow light that you see is actually just light bouncing off these little tiny plates of cilia that are fused together and stacked on top of each other almost like dominoes. So when one moves, the and it helps them swim through the water. [Tommy] When we shine our their cilia diffract the light into a moving rainbow all over the body. The Monterey Bay Aquarium ever to this display and some of these other [Dalton] It's not often a deep-sea creature face-to-face. Into the Deep takes this vast and unknown wilderness and brings it into the public awareness. [Ellen] The opportunity what's deep down in the ocean to everyone, is really cool. [Tommy] We really can't wait to share all these amazing animals with you!
