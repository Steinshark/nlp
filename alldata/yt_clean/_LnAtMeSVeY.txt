[applause] &gt;&gt;NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Thank you all for coming to our-- Is it our 17th or 18th Annual Isaac Asimov Memorial Panel Debate? For all previous years we have been doing we have focused on the universe. Astrophysics. My particular specialty. This will be the first year where we break And it's a mold that really shouldn't because, in memory of Isaac Asimov who wrote was, invented And so this year, our topic will be biologically A topic for which this institution is uniquely to not only have experts, but find experts Tonight's topic is de-extinction. Oh my gosh. De-extinction. I'll bring you up to speed on a few things. This event was founded back when we opened and it was on monies generated by friends of Isaac Asimov in his memory. He had died in the early 1990s. I had not known that much of the research his 600 books that he had written at this institution. So, he was a friend of the institution, and this is the living memorial to him. Not only that, I just thought I'd give you astrophysics updates just while I have you. [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: Later this summer in specifically August 21st, These are not as rare as any press would have because practically every total solar eclipse "Rare eclipse occurs." Total solar eclipses are about every two-and-a-half somewhere on Earth. No one says, "Rare Olympics coming up." "Rare presidential election." So if you see someone say rare eclipse, just... They haven't taken Astronomy 101. [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: So the reason why I'm the moon's shadow landfalls in Oregon leave the United States, and the only land it would have touched So it's America's eclipse And we live in an era where people can travel. The last time the United States had a good travel was much less common either by car So we expect no fewer than 100 million people bear witness to this. If you want to get hotel rooms in the eclipse it's too late. So just letting you know. So let us begin. This is a debate, but not in any formal sense. We're just going to have a conversation you are eavesdropping That's how we have constructed We have a mixture of expertise that has strong and strong diversity of world view So let me first bring out for you Ross MacPhee. Ross, come on out. [applause] &gt;&gt;TYSON: Ross is Curator of Mammalogy here at the Museum. Of course, that makes him an expert in mammals. Next, we will go to George Church. George Church is Professor of Genetics George. [applause] &gt;&gt;GEORGE CHURCH: Great seeing you. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Thanks, man. Up in Boston, Massachusetts. Next, Greg Kaebnick. Greg, welcome. Alright. [applause] &gt;&gt;TYSON: He's a Research Scholar His background is in moral philosophy. So we're going to hit that a little later. Yeah, okay. Moral philosophy. It's not whether you can do it. It's whether you should do it. Yes. [laughter] Next, we have Beth Shapiro. Beth, come on out. [applause] &gt;&gt;TYSON: Beth is Professor of Paleogenomics at University of Santa Cruz. University of California, Santa Cruz. And she actually wrote a book on how to... Yeah, how to... &gt;&gt;BETH SHAPIRO: Clone. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Clone. Yeah, okay. Yeah, how to clone a mammoth. We'll get more on that a little later. We'll ask her if she's already done that-- &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Right. &gt;&gt;TYSON: --in her basement. [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: Just checking. And last, we have Hank Greely. Hank, come on out. [applause] &gt;&gt;TYSON: So, Hank is a Professor of Law at Stanford University. [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: Oh, you can keep... Yeah. A Professor of Law at Stanford University, &gt;&gt;GREELY: Sciences. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Biosciences. Thank you. Thank you for correcting me. So, we will first give, like, a one-minute opening each one of them, So Hank, tell us just why you're here. &gt;&gt;GREELY: You invited me. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay, good. Thank you. Thank you. GREELY: I'm a law professor at Stanford. For the last 25 years I've worked on ethical, implications arising from advances Mainly genetics, but also neuroscience, assisted stem cell research, and any other thing that And about four years ago I got invited to by de-extinction, &gt;&gt;TYSON: So how did you pick up the science along the way if you're fundamentally a law person? &gt;&gt;GREELY: A lot of reading, friends. It turns out that scientists will talk to [laughter] &gt;&gt;GREELY: --about what they love to as long as you seem to nod at the right spots time. &gt;&gt;TYSON: But it's promising think of getting a degree as the end of what &gt;&gt;GREELY: Yeah. My last bio class was in 10th grade, which was at least 15 years ago. &gt;&gt;TYSON: And what grade did &gt;&gt;GREELY: I got an A, thank you. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Nice, very nice. &gt;&gt;HANK GREELY: A positive. [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: Beth. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Yes. So, my background is in ancient DNA, So, for the last 20 years or so, I've been picking up bones and So as far as de-extinction is concerned, Like, can it actually happen, and what technologies &gt;&gt;TYSON: So you go back to or do you go really deep in time? &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: With genetics, with DNA, is 700,000 years old, around that old, found frozen in the Arctic permafrost. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay. So that's... So your professional relationship to data. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: That's right. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: We can reconstruct data further but the oldest that we've been able to recover is about 700. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay. All right, thank you. Greg? &gt;&gt;GREGORY KAEBNICK: All right. So I'm the moral philosopher. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Uh-huh. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: I'm here to think about how the value questions raised by various concerns that we might have. So I've done work over the last 15 years questions ranging from, you know, sort of benefits and costs, risk and uncertainty, under conditions of uncertainty. Precaution and what that means. But the questions that have always most interested I think because they're hardest to articulate, but also, I think that they sort of underlie are questions about the human relationship And what that means, how we understand that, the world as we find it. &gt;&gt;TYSON: We just want to control nature. That's the answer. Yeah. We got the answer to that question long ago. George. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Yeah. So, I mostly develop technologies for reading and writing and interpreting your genomes, those same technologies can be applied to and endangered species. So when we read the genome, you can learn what actionable things you can do about your &gt;&gt;TYSON: By risk you mean health risks? &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Health risks, yes. And when we write it we can use it for gene or we can use it for making new agricultural We have a project called the Personal Genome where you can participate in medical research, &gt;&gt;TYSON: Are you coming to solicit &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Yeah. All of you should join it. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yeah. Okay. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Yeah. We have-- One of the centers is here in New York. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Mm-hmm. All right, Ross. &gt;&gt;ROSS MACPHEE: I'm what's called a Pleistocene and that means that of you: And, in undertaking that over the last 30 years, I've always been fascinated by extinction. We'll get to de-extinction, about which But the idea that species have been lost over the idea that humans, to some degree or other makes it the sort of subject matter that really especially going forward into our future of species are going to be lost in future. So, what a paleontological perspective brings is a notion of what the world was like in what we've lost, gain again. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Good. Very clean. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: You're welcome. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Thank you. That's our panel, yes. So... [applause] &gt;&gt;TYSON: So, for the next hour that we're having at a bar. At the end, we'll make time for questions for you. So Ross, what do we have here? This, obviously the dodo bird, right? &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: That is a dodo. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay. And this is a... That's a jaw... &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Jaw, arm bone, and some tusks these are casts-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: A mammoth and... &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: --from North America. And then down at the end, Say yes. Good, good. It's a thylacine. It's a marsupial. &gt;&gt;TYSON: I was going to say &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: He was going to say that. [laughter] &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: That became extinct finally &gt;&gt;TYSON: And dodo went extinct &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Last... Well, we've had an argument, Beth and I, but we would say the last quarter or so &gt;&gt;TYSON: And the mammoth went &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: About 10,000 years ago on both Eurasia and in North America, in some islands north of Siberia. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Did we render these &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Well, this is a question. We certainly-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yeah, I know it's That's why I asked you. That's why I'm standing on your left shoulder, &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: There was an idea about human &gt;&gt;TYSON: Because I first heard phrase &quot;sixth extinction,&quot; And so, is this part of that? What's going on? &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Well, it is, because what hear the word sixth ext--or the words &quot;sixth it's sort of all prospective. This is what's going to happen in future. It's predictions. But there is a past tense to extinction, were complicit or not, And it has to do with the spread of people And in case after case, where humans are newly environment where they haven't been previously you find evidence of loss. And you find evidence of mega loss in many particularly islands. So what I want you to grasp from all of this the sixth extinction has a background-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: Wait, just a sec. You said lost particularly on islands, So presumably then it's more sensitive to Is that why? &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Well, perhaps so, but the that it's when people come, the animals &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: And that's a repeating phenomenon. Now, with regard to the dodo, it's up in humans actually hunted it. It's more likely that the dogs and the pigs that people brought with them to this tiny southwestern part of the Indian Ocean And for that reason, they died out. For mammoths, we don't know. Human hunting, of course, is a leading theory. But there was also climate change and possibly With thylacines we have something really interesting, that the Australian government century. But the numbers didn't collapse until right of the 20th century. And the question has always been, or was there something else going on? A cofactor-- as well-- did it. &gt;&gt;TYSON: So George, you-- of understanding the genetic identity of life. Is that a fair way to characterize what you &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Well, that's... yeah, that's &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yeah. So you look at the genetic code and you say, and this property Might you one day be able to adjust genetic to make it resistant to what might render in that moment? Will you have that much power in your lab? Will you admit to having that much power-- [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: --in your lab? &gt;&gt;CHURCH: So, this is already happening in agricultural settings where you'll make, drought resistant, salt resistant for-- you know, to adapt to climate change, a natural component of the plants. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Wait. So you're telling me that is not stopping climate change. It's making climate change resistant animals? &gt;&gt;CHURCH: That would be a nice story, No, I think we need a little of each, maybe, &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay. So, you are there. So, Greg, you think about this and the consequences and why. Everything I've heard thus far, to it, [laughter] &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Um, well... &gt;&gt;TYSON: I mean that with love. [laughter] &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Well, love is actually really the key thing, here. So, when I think about the human relationship that we have a variety of different ways that that we can think of ourselves as standing We can be consumers of it. That's, you know, a kind of ideal. We can be protectors, we can be reinventors. We can reinvent nature with synthetic biology. I tend to plug for the protector ideal, means. For me, at the bottom of it-- and unphilosophical But I think that it's really, it's about... It's about love of place and, you know, love of the world as we find it, you know? This place, it's love of inheritance. Love of things given. And so the question is, what does that mean? How do we go forward with that? I'm actually not a naysayer about this technology. I think the technology is very exciting, and how it can be used in a simple way to extinct Which is sort of functionally extinct out but you can tweak it. There are people in SUNY campuses render it capable of overcoming the blight But I'm kind of worried about... Well, I think that some of the examples of are going to kind of take us off track if protect this thing we love. And I worry about where it could eventually There are cases of it that I'm kind of... I'm totally fine with. I'm not against the technology, go. &gt;&gt;TYSON: So Beth has already and she wrote a book-- [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: --that is... You can buy it in the back. [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: Beth, does it teach all of us how to clone a mammoth? &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Yes. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: It's a step-by-step manual, [laughter] &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: If you buy the book, you can &gt;&gt;TYSON: You can have a mammoth &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Garage. Keep it inside. &gt;&gt;TYSON: In your garage, yeah. This is New York. We don't have garages. So... &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Big garage. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Rooftop. &gt;&gt; TYSON: Rooftop mammoths. That'll work. [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: So, how is this idea Or your more skeptical colleagues? First, is it really possible You've got the good DNA to do this, and And why? &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Okay, so that's about seven I'm just going to back up a bit. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Wait, let me add an &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Okay. &gt;&gt;TYSON: The mammoth, we all the Ice Age, right? &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Right. &gt;&gt;TYSON: So you want to clone and bring it back That's cruel. That's just cruel. [laughter] &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: All right. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: So one of the arguments about bringing a mammoth back to life rapid global warming. And I can get to that in a little bit, and first say, can you clone a mammoth? Because the answer to that is no. &gt;&gt;TYSON: And you wrote a whole [laughter] &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: It's a very short book. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay. [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay. If we have the genome... Is it we don't know how to yet? &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: No. &gt;&gt;TYSON: George has not given &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: George is not cloning a mammoth &gt;&gt;TYSON: No, but he's making &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: --scientific words. So, in order to clone something, and when we think about cloning, that comes to mind-- This is the first cloned animal. But we have Dolly the sheep because we had, that we were able to take The kind of cell that can go on and become We can't do that with a mammoth, When we go out into the field and we collect we end up with bones that we can extract DNA But that DNA is in terrible condition. The fragments of DNA are chopped up into base Little base pairs of like 30 to 40 bases long. If I extracted DNA from a hair the inside of my mouth of DNA. That's not what we get. &gt;&gt;TYSON: So we can clone you... &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: We can clone me. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: We might not want to, but [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: But I've seen shows-- where a mammoth came out of the glacier. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Right. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Dead mammoth in The crevasse filled up and everybody forgot and then this glacier--during global warming--melts. And out pops a mammoth which I would think You're telling me no. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Right. Key word: dead mammoth. If it's dead, it's not going to have any As soon as an organism dies, the DNA in every one of those cells starts First, because we have enzymes in our own bodies and then because of bacteria and plant DNA &gt;&gt;TYSON: Oh... &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: --that get into that and Break it down into tinier and tinier fragments. &gt;&gt;TYSON: What you're telling Jurassic Park was just B.S. That's what you're saying. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: For many more reasons than [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Yes. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay, Hank. Is this... You're the lawyer here. &gt;&gt;GREELY: I'm not licensed in this [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: All the better. Now you can say anything you want. &gt;&gt;GREELY: I can't help you. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Is there... What are the legal ramifications of this at Because when I think de-extinction, I'm I'm thinking philosophy and purpose and And you're making a whole career of this, &gt;&gt;GREELY: Well, a very small part of a very small career is being made out of this But there are legal issues everywhere. So, for example, de-extinction How many maimed, deformed, stillborn, to bring back a sort-of mammoth? There are actually laws in this country, that deal with some of those issues. If you actually brought a mammoth back, That may seem like a dumb question, &gt;&gt;TYSON: Wait, if you brought yeah, I would say that it would be an endangered &gt;&gt;GREELY: Well... &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Would it be a species? &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Would it be a species? &gt;&gt;TYSON: Oh, it wouldn't be a species? &gt;&gt;GREELY: And also-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: Wait, wait, wait, wait. What do you mean? I have an animal standing in front of me is &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Well, it would be... It might not be a mammoth at this point. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: It's part elephant, right? &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yeah. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: So we can't clone it, our way &gt;&gt;TYSON: But, so if you use add some mammoth DNA, mammolophant... &gt;&gt;GREELY: Mammophant, I think, is the &gt;&gt;TYSON: Mammophant, excuse We got terminology already. &gt;&gt;GREELY: Yep. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay. &gt;&gt;GREELY: We're on it. &gt;&gt;TYSON: If you're going to get a mammophant, so, why isn't that its own species? &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: We got problems defining species &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yeah. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay. &gt;&gt;GREELY: And we have even bigger problems In part because the biologists and the philosophers [laughter] &gt;&gt;GREELY: So, not only do you have to whether this mammophant-- &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Blame it on us. &gt;&gt;GREELY: --is a species. You also, under the Endangered Species Act, And whether it's-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: So we even know &gt;&gt;GREELY: --endangered in its natural range. So, then you have to ask the Department of and various other governmental bodies The ranchers will probably be opposed. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Do we still have a &gt;&gt;GREELY: For several-- [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: I haven't checked &gt;&gt;GREELY: For several more weeks. [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: Several more weeks. All right. Ross. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Yeah. &gt;&gt;TYSON: You specialize in understanding in a way that you want to prevent it. That's noble. Meanwhile, you have other people trying to So, where is your moral compass on this in Because there's a lot of brainpower here species that have already been extinct when they could be thinking about how to protect that are already at risk and we know we're because we're in the house. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Right, but those are separate I'm going to start with what Hank just said because, for me, that is the outstanding question. It has nothing to do whether is its own species or what have you. It's an individual. And we have an obligation, the way I look especially if we have created it in some fashion, And when does that responsibility end? By virtue of trying to bring back mammoths have we taken on a responsibility that has I would say yes, because what we're doing and in that event, we have to look at it to any living thing. Now, do I object to what is being done trying very hard to I don't in principle, of thing a lot from. What I want to hear, however, at the end of is that anything we do create That we have some expectation for it. That it will be kept in a way that we would any other natural species or a set of natural &gt;&gt;TYSON: But, Greg, there's I've heard about a zoo. So if you're going to make a whole new set either resurrected from extinction and now you create a habitat for it-- to its survival-- in any comfortable way a zoo. Morally, what does it mean to create an animal create an animal out of thin air, &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Well, I mean, to me, Now, it might... it might, um... &gt;&gt;TYSON: Because you'd want it to roam free and be part of the environment? &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yeah. No, if you've just created it as a sort of tourist attraction you haven't really accomplished what de-extinction, purportedly would accomplish. Now, you might wanna create a zoo for the this is one of the projects that George has because it might be part of some larger effort to actually change the environment. So there was actually an article that came in The Atlantic, I think, about Pleistocene playing off Jurassic Park. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Pleistocene Park. So this would be Ice Age. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Pleistocene-- &gt;&gt;CHURCH: It's not really a classic zoo. It's much more like-- &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Right. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: It's really, yeah... &gt;&gt;CHURCH: It's much closer to the &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Well, yeah. It's closer to the wild. &gt;&gt;GREELY: Large animal park. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: It's quixotic is what it &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Yeah. It's fenced in, yeah. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Quixotic, yes. Pleistocene Park is-- &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: So the idea here... George can walk through this, &gt;&gt;TYSON: Just remind me. Pleistocene contained which kinds of animals? &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Well... &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: All of these big animals that Mammoths and-- &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yeah. The big Ice Age mammals. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: --bison and-- &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Mammophant. &gt;&gt;TYSON: So all the ones that were in the Ice Age movie. all of those. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yes. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Except the dodo, which was somehow in the Ice Age movie, although they... &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yeah, there was a dodo in the Ice Age movie. Yeah. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Yeah. That was... that was bad. &gt;&gt;GREELY: There was a weasel also. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yeah, there was... [laughter] &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: What was his name again? &gt;&gt;GREELY: Gosh, it was a funny name. &gt;&gt;TYSON: I had a cameo. &gt;&gt;GREELY: Neil deSomething Weasel? &gt;&gt;TYSON: I had a cameo in Ice &gt;&gt;GREELY: Which he's now regretting &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yes. There were four other [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: So, to Pleistocene. So Pleistocene Park. So these are the most recent sort of wave &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yeah. &gt;&gt;TYSON: You put them in the &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: But also things that are still &gt;&gt;GREGORY: Right. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: They're horses and bison &gt;&gt;NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: That were around in and are still here today. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: The Pleistocene was over 10,000 You're talking about the most recent ice There are lots of animals that were alive &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Right. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Muskox and-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: Including humans. &gt;&gt;GREELY: Yes. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Including humans. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yeah. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: I mean, really what's de-extinction and a kind of geoengineering Pleistocene Park is... it, back so that the... You'd have these mega-herbivores knocking allowing the winter freeze to really freeze and you could then lock in methane that is in the subarctic. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Is this simply because &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yeah, they're stomping around and pushing the snow aside to get at the grass and... &gt;&gt;GREELY: Lots of manure. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: But it's the snow that's because snow is a very efficient insulator. And the temperature of that Arctic permafrost And if you have the snow, it traps that summer Whereas if you get rid of it, something to eat, and bring down the temperature. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Wow. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Can I say a few words on Pleistocene &gt;&gt;CHURCH: And this has been done experimentally. &gt;&gt;NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Yeah. &gt;&gt;ROSS MACPHEE: --because I don't think defined here for the audience This is the idea that you can, to some degree, Because it's actually the northern part-- at the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere 1,600 billion tons of carbon like methane. And the idea is that, as the planet warms, and sort of work along with what humans are to really make the greenhouse gas problem &gt;&gt;TYSON: And just to remind because carbon dioxide as a gas, its name But methane, though carbon isn't in its &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: And it's a much-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: A much more potent &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Twenty-eight times more potent. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Right. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: But here is the issue. It is a wonderful idea, but I called it quixotic interpretation that we can somehow turn the That we can go back to something that we lost. And what did we lose? We lost this idea of the mammoth steppe: from Western Europe Alaska and Yukon and North America. A huge, huge biome. But what happened at the end of the Pleistocene, was a very marked change in the climate of such that the dominant plants at the time, non-graminoid-- started to go into decline. And what replaced them was not anything that What you've got in the far north now is It is largely dominated by mosses like sphagnum and you've got these forests that are made birch and alder and larch and so forth especially large herbivores of the sort that So, in order to institute this plan, part of Eurasia-- the moment-- animals that we've which is something that George and Beth have to introduce genes that will permit them to these very cold conditions. But what's left out of the equation, is that there's nothing for them to eat and it will take centuries-- before there's been enough terraforming are there in abundance. Up until that time, they have to be provisioned. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Wait, wait. But Ross, I-- &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: So that makes Pleistocene a very large zoo. &gt;&gt;TYSON: But Ross, you're Because George, in his lab, can just mammophants ones didn't eat. So what? He can do that in his lab in the future. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Is that so, George? [laughter] &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Yeah. I don't want to make any promises, here. There certainly are animals that eat some and you can detoxify them in a variety of It wouldn't be out of the question. You can also accelerate... I mean, I think that terraforming is... have a chance at it. But there are components that could accelerate &gt;&gt;TYSON: So let me ask both There's what, in the public, consequences. Of course it's not a law. It's just recognizing what is common as much as they should. [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: And that's kind of So, when you're creating new species have you really thought it through? Have you thought through its effect on the The effect of the environment on it? What its effect would be on bacteria, on parasites, Everything in what seems to me to be a very Because if you haven't, then you're dangerous. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: I'm definitely dangerous. [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay. You got that. Okay. That answers that. &gt;&gt;GREELY: But you know-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: Hank, what's-- &gt;&gt;GREELY: So let me jump in on this. Because this is where thinking about but also thinking about how this would really And I think of de-extinction as at least a One part is making a few individuals, population of some sort, prepared environment. The advantage of thinking about it in three is you can use the first and second phase to figure out the questions that you properly Are these going to be an environmental pest? Are they going to be kudzu? Are they going to be starlings A Shakespeare enthusiast brought some starlings released them in Central Park, all over. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: He probably hadn't thought &gt;&gt;GREELY: Yeah. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: --before. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Starlings? &gt;&gt;GREELY: Starlings. Little black birds. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Why do I... I only see pigeons, so what... [laughter] &gt;&gt;GREELY: They left Central Park. They went to the suburbs. &gt;&gt;TYSON: That's what I was Yeah, yeah. They moved into Scarsdale. &gt;&gt;GREELY: But you need a framework for what the consequences are, do the process in phases, We don't have that framework now, about this You shouldn't be able to release a de-extinct into the wild unless somebody's looked at yeah, on balance. This doesn't look very dangerous. And one last point on that, how do we clean up the mess? You know, I'm not very worried about-- but locating and killing off rampaging mammoths-- If passenger pigeons got out in North America there were three billion of them, figuring out which is a passenger pigeon is going to be difficult. &gt;&gt;TYSON: To a New Yorker they're Yeah. &gt;&gt;GREELY: Right. &gt;&gt;DEGRASSE TYSON: Yeah. &gt;&gt;GREELY: And should be extinct, right? [laughter] &gt;&gt;GREELY: But- &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Well, we had no trouble killing passenger pigeons the first time around. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Yeah. &gt;&gt;GREELY: Yeah. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: That was pretty easy. &gt;&gt;GREELY: Yeah, that's true. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yeah. Apparently. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: We're pretty good at that. &gt;&gt;HANK GREELY: But, so thinking through what what kind of regulatory structure you want is really important &gt;&gt;TYSON: Well, wait. Since when does regulatory structure precede Isn't it always after the fact to regulate? &gt;&gt;GREELY: Not always. Often. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: But it kind of is now, anyway. I mean, this question-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: In practice. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: --these questions are not &gt;&gt;GREELY: Yes. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: If we think about translocations or introducing species into different habitats, invasive species-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: On purpose and by accident. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Both ways. And without thinking beforehand or how we're going to control them. &gt;&gt;GREELY: Though sometimes we actually the most interesting recent de-extinction, a local/regional de-extinction, Wolves weren't extinct all over the world but they were sure as heck extinct in Yellowstone. And after lots of debate and discussion, They have changed the ecosystem there... Or at least their reappearance has correlated significant changes in the ecosystem there. [laughter] &gt;&gt;GREELY: That's for Ross. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Well said. &gt;&gt;GREELY: In ways that many people think But every time you do a reintroduction-- when it was reduced to captive populations-- And it's really not... I don't think it's different. We just don't have a good regulatory structure dealing with de-extinction &gt;&gt;TYSON: Where did the California &gt;&gt;GREELY: It went to a bunch of pens. It went to a captive breeding facility. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Yeah. I don't remember exactly when it was, some point &gt;&gt;GREELY: Yep. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: --from the wild so that they could try to make as many &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay. So Beth, I have a question. There's this talk of you need enough of de-extinctified individuals to-- &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: I hate that word. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Actually, I was... This is all new vocabulary to me. My apologies. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Yeah. &gt;&gt;TYSON: You need enough of what you call a breeding colony. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Right. &gt;&gt;TYSON: But if you can just why do they have to bring them? &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: [laughs] &gt;&gt;TYSON: If George in the future Oh, you need another? A mammoth? A female mam... Here! And then three weeks later, They don't even have to breed. You just manufacture them. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Well, despite what you might [laughter] &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: --it takes longer than three to make an elephant. [laughter] &gt;&gt;GREELY: Gestation period of 22 months. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Yeah. To start with-- &gt;&gt;GREELY: Think about that. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: --there's that. &gt;&gt;TYSON: George can fix that. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: But I think-- [laughter] &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Just tweak a few genes, yeah. [laughter] &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: You have a new solution for &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Poison-resistant instant &gt;&gt;TYSON: In the Sistine Chapel-- [laughter and applause] &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: As a serous answer to that &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yes, thank you, sorry. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: As a serious answer, create a population that's somehow going just by continued lab work and spending money of surviving And this is part of why it's so hard. I mean, we can't think that we're just one elephant/mammoth hybrid and release it but we need decades of making multiple individuals. Fortunately, we're not talking about because George's work, for example, has has just... has been to swap out I think 50 genes or so I don't know how many you've done. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Yes. &gt;&gt;BETH SHAPIRO: And... but the rest of the It's still the elephant genome that you So there will be natural diversity in these except for where it matters, distinct from each other. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Ross, you're trying protect species that might be at risk. But suppose we decide as a culture have extinct &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Flies. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Well... I think we've-- &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Mosquitos. &gt;&gt;TYSON: --tamped down flies a hundred years ago. What I'm thinking specifically is, which President Carter is working to and humans are their only host. So therefore... It's a terrible scourge where it still is The point is, this is an act of purposely a lifeform on Earth extinct. Should we, can we, is this the right thing There are animals that go extinct because but if we know we don't want something because is that so wrong? And take it down to the smallpox virus, to &gt;&gt;GREELY: That's a flu. That's influenza. &gt;&gt;TYSON: The flu virus. The flu virus that makes-- &gt;&gt;GREELY: But smallpox is a great example. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yeah. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Well, you know, the flu virus Because just this week, it was announced that a particular flu called H7N9, and change one letter in its genetic code So when you're thinking about what you want and get rid of, biology individuals going to mess around with this kind of technology &gt;&gt;TYSON: And the weaponization of science and technology has been we've been warring tribes. Which, I guess, we still are. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: And we've learned very little &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yeah. What, Hank? &gt;&gt;GREELY: So weaponization: nice example. Nobody's going to build a whole bunch of and use them as war elephants. [laughter] &gt;&gt;GREELY: But... &gt;&gt;TYSON: Wait, wait. In Star Wars there was something that looked &gt;&gt;GREELY: Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt;TYSON: I thought I remember... &gt;&gt;GREELY: We could resurrect Han Solo &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: It would be hard to keep secret. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: But why do we ask the question very large beasts? You know, if you take a look at the 500 years, Another 20% were bats. How many of those would you like to have de-extincted, Because they're not... They don't have the charisma, &gt;&gt;TYSON: They don't have a &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Nor do they have that. &gt;&gt;GREELY: But to go back to the biowarfare [laughter] &gt;&gt;GREELY: --I mean... And I really do think this may be the most de-extinction, in a way, is a bit of a sideshow. It's a fascinating sideshow, particularly through a new process that you've called CRISPR, Repeat, allows us to modify the genomes of almost in ways that are easier, et cetera. So if you wanna change the world, You're going to make smallpox. You're going to take horse pox or dog pox turn it into smallpox, and let it loose. If you're a gardener-- see because of the lights Anybody-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: This is New York City. Just be... &gt;&gt;GREELY: Okay. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Rooftop. &gt;&gt;GREELY: Blue roses. There are no true blue roses. Somebody's going to use CRISPR to make blue &gt;&gt;TYSON: I want more blue food. &gt;&gt;GREELY: Somebody is going to use CRISPR &gt;&gt;TYSON: After blueberries and &gt;&gt;GREELY: Somebody's going to use CRISPR People are going... De-extinction is only one small piece of what power over biology is going to do. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Can you use CRISPR that have wool in different colors? Then you don't have to dye the wool. &gt;&gt;GREELY: Probably. One thing that's already been done in China more meat and longer hair for, Whatever it is that you get out of goats. Goat hair. So they modified the goats to make them more And we're going to keep doing that. They modified pigs to get little tiny pigs They're not that tiny. When they're adults they're about the But they were intended as lab animals, they so they sold them as pets. This is do-able today. It doesn't take millions of dollars. It doesn't take 10 post-docs. It takes a couple of people with bio backgrounds &gt;&gt;TYSON: So, Greg, synthetic has powers that are being... The public, the press, perhaps, is focusing her clone mammoth &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: George's clone mammoth. [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: George's... &gt;&gt;GREELY: Inter-fighting fighting over [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: But not on the general to solve problems. And you talk about weaponization. Of course, in the tradition of what they used tank/antitank warfare, Then you invent something that can defeat in case the enemy did that, and you just keep So if you have the power then presumably you have the power &gt;&gt;GREELY: A vaccine. &gt;&gt;TYSON: A vaccine with the &gt;&gt;GREELY: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt;TYSON: And isn't that how &gt;&gt;GREELY: Yes. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay. &gt;&gt;GREELY: But you'd hold the antidote, and not let the other side get it. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Sounds like you've &gt;&gt;GREELY: And I'm... I came sort of late to this biosecurity game. The Director of National Intelligence under announced back in I think November, December the four most important &gt;&gt;TYSON: So, Greg, is there to rendering species that we don't like And is there something kind of messed up-- point-- fuzzy animals Certainly not a bat, and certainly not a rodent. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yeah. Well, I mean, if I had to pick... If I had to pick an animal to try this with, it would probably be the gastric brooding The only problem with that is-- it would almost immediately go extinct again, fungus, and-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: Wait, wait. This is the gastric breeding frog &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Brooding. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Oh, brooding frog. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yeah, it's a very... &gt;&gt;TYSON: Why? [laughter] &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: No one knows why, but &gt;&gt;TYSON: No, no, no. Why do you want to bring that back? &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Oh, because... It's not so much that I want to bring it &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Because it broods its babies &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yeah. The stomach-- &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: It's cool. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: --turns into a uterus It's the only animal that changes one organ And so it's this fascinating case-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: This is just creepy. This is... [laughter] &gt;&gt;GREELY: You should see the photos of and all the little baby frogs in her mouth. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Burping out babies. &gt;&gt;GREELY: Yep. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: So, you know, it's a-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: So you would do this [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: That's why you want... You're a moral philosopher, and you would just 'cause it's kinda cool? &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Uh, no. Absolutely not. I- Most of the things that get talked about as I think flatly don't count. And the phrase "bring back" end. That cannot happen. It just logically cannot happen. A species is somehow a set of things, doesn't exist anymore. And you can't sort of... The language of "bring back" implies that down in some netherworld and can be kind of George or another biotechnological- &gt;&gt;CHURCH: So did we bring back the &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Well, the bison, &gt;&gt;CHURCH: From the brink. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: From the brink. &gt;&gt;DEGRASSE TYSON: So, what's the difference? &gt;&gt;CHURCH: So if you've got-- &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Well, the lineage... &gt;&gt;CHURCH: --thousands of frozen mammoths bring those back... &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Well, I mean, if you could really, really recreate the species. But I don't think you can &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Yeah, I haven't accepted Beth's comments, by the way. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yeah. Well, the two of you can have it out. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Yeah. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: I think we're arguing over I mean, I do think that once a species is you can't bring that back. What we--any organism is a mixture of what DNA codes and the environment in which we And we can't recreate that environment, Even if we could change every single one of million-and-a-half differences between and make something that is genetically identical the thing that is born to an Asian elephant or inside a massive piece of cool-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: Lab. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Lab equipment. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Yeah. that is very cool technology. [laughs] &gt;&gt;CHURCH: But the next generation would born from mammoths. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Right, but it still won't But my argument is that it doesn't matter, it's cool vision Those--people like George who genuinely thing is something that we should do-- &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Is that true? &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: By restoring interactions Maybe that's not true. I'm speaking for you, here. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yeah, what drew you to &gt;&gt;CHURCH: What? &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: What drew you to the project Was it the geoengineering issue, or was it-- &gt;&gt;CHURCH: No. I think the-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: We're asking you moral code at all, George. If I may summarize their question. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Actually, I think I'm being I actually have published many papers on bioethics, &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Oh, I don't mean... &gt;&gt;CHURCH: I'm in Greg's camp. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yeah, I don't mean to &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Yeah. But the-- me to it probably-- extinct mammals-- I think it's going extinct, and it's a than trying to terraform, which I think is... Even anything in the right direction is a But the Asian elephants are going extinct One is there is a herpes virus that's killing And they're in close proximity and conflict So if you could extend their range even a to one of the largest ecosystems in the world that would be good for the Asian elephant. And the wooly mammoth is so close to the Asian they probably could breed successfully. Whether you have a mammophant or you have fully recreate the mammoth genome, Because the Asian elephant and the African which are much further apart--have bread So the two closer ones could. &gt;&gt;TYSON: So, George, I didn't You're saying the Asian elephant, and the African elephant than the Asian elephant is from the mammoth? &gt;&gt;CHURCH: That's correct. Even though you might say they look more alike, Because the mammoth is radically changed but it did it in presumably in a fairly &gt;&gt;TYSON: So let me ask What brings me to this question is there's a time where you are, if you're the bottles they drink from. And then while you're sterilizing all the your kid is licking the baseboards of the [laughter] &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Yeah. Very clean floor at this &gt;&gt;TYSON: So what are you doing, right? And you realize--so without humans, Earth of &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Ninety-nine percent. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Ninety-nine percent of species that &gt;&gt; MACPHEE: Which means it's a natural &gt;&gt;TYSON: Natural phenomenon. And if extinction is natural, why are we I said I'm being heretical here-- if Isn't that just our place on Earth, be at is nature? Why isn't--is that a puts forth? &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Well, sure, absolutely, yes. I mean, Aldo Leopold said something like we mourned it, we humans mourned it. And that was the first, that was the first So yeah, extinction is a natural process. A species that goes extinct through natural reason to feel bad about. &gt;&gt;TYSON: [No obligation.] &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: But if we're the agents of it, of the degree of interference in the &gt;&gt;GREELY: There are a lot of things--natural &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Right. &gt;&gt;GREELY: So it's a natural process. &gt;&gt;TYSON: It is in many people's minds. They think, oh, if nature is good-- &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Not smallpox. &gt;&gt;GREELY: It is a natural process for our &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yes. &gt;&gt;GREELY: And it is a natural process Just because something that's natural Just because it's unnatural doesn't mean We need to pick our fights, and I important questions about what we should them on. &gt;&gt;TYSON: So Greg, something I-- history, we find out that things that were to do, and later generations would say, So where's the moral compass here? Does it evolve along with our technology &gt;&gt; GREG: Yes. &gt;&gt;TYSON: OK. Absolutely. I mean, it's... Morality is culture. &gt;&gt; NEIL: It's culture. &gt;&gt; GREG: Yes. &gt;&gt; NEIL: So where is it now? What is that compass pointing to now? Who on this panel is it pointing to or not? [laughter] &gt;&gt; TYSON: No, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: I don't get the question. Who's right? &gt;&gt;TYSON: Who will we-- &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: The question is to what do we That is the question. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Do we have a moral obligation &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yes. Is there moral obligation &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: No. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Is there a moral obligation to our otherwise subtract from our health? &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yeah, probably, to the second question. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: I think we're choosing a very We brought back make arguments that they would make better &gt;&gt;TYSON: So if you're going to bring back make sure they're tasty, and that will assure Cows will never go extinct. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: And so, with rodents and goats like Galapagos because they're making other They're more beautiful or they're tourist And Ecuador is intentionally removing them worldwide, but this is part of the reason &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: It's a case-by-case thing. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Greg, do you factor in the economic I just had a conversation Because the cork has some variability from and so that's bad. So they say, let's find something to bottle that you drink that did not have a that is fewer cork trees that will be harvested And the cork trees are otherwise else. So in fact, the demand for cork is So in terms of bringing back a mammoth, that assures its success going forward, &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Well, we did kill them in the first [laughter] &gt;&gt;GREELY: For juicy steaks. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: For juicy steaks. &gt;&gt;TYSON: So the cavemen said, this would &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Or at least we killed some There's evidence of that. &gt;&gt; CHURCH: Big ribs. They were desperate. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Ross, did we kill all three of &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: [Sighs] Yes and no. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Ross, that is not an answer. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: I have a question about this, It's about the day after, and by that, I you bring back a mammoth mimic, can have some sort of expectation of being How long does the interest stay there? At what point do you say, well, it's just It's just another kind of steak I want to point out that in this country, de-extinction experiment going on for the Do you know about it? &gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Horses. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Horses, exactly. Horses used to How do we treat horses now, the Western part of this country? They're excluded to Bureau of Land Each year, it seems to utilize goes down because the ranches cows, the energy companies don't like And my point in saying this is that the in all So we've gone to all of this hand wringing to create these animals that, in effect, become part of the landscape. And that's my problem with all of this. It is that obligation that we're just we do this sort of thing. It's the same thing with introducing species the goats in the Galapagos, the rodents on the world's islands. They shouldn't be there. We're responsible for having done it. It has an effect on the flora and the fauna My feeling is that we have to the degree possible, and that does not &gt;&gt;TYSON: Correct, it means restore it to was very different from what it was &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Restoration in that sense is for what's still there to persist. I think that's the point. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Hank, if there are members have anything to do with climate change, introduce legislation that would need matters that have been presented here today? &gt;&gt;GREELY: Introducing's easy. Getting Takes one to introduce, I think, actually, to by environmentalist fears and I don't see it happening [laughter] &gt;&gt;GREELY: Unless--Congress basically There's a disaster, and then Congress just stand there, do something. And so a disaster involving And for that, it's useful to prepared in advance so when the moment And the other is a long, negotiated period and over five or 10 years, they cut deals. Either of those could happen with this. I think the national security and implications will push it, and de-extinction part of it. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Like you said, it's really &gt;&gt;GREELY: Yeah. It's a really fascinating &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay, Hank just called your [laughter] &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Right. Except-- [laughter] &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: What I argue or tend to argue would need to develop to bring an extinct that one needs to do, what George has is alive today, but in danger of becoming it a better chance at staying alive. And this is the same. It's the same thing. This is a spectrum much like species are, &gt;&gt;TYSON: So ways to apply the power &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Ways to apply the power that that doesn't really exist yet that we would manipulating the trajectory of life, much 30,000 years when we first took a gray wolf warn us that our neighbors were coming. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Warn us that wolves would come. That's like, got to be the most cruel thing wolf into something that warns us that [laughter] &gt;&gt;GREELY: Turn a wolf into a Chihuahua. That's cruel. &gt;&gt;TYSON: That's--yeah. That's just-- &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: There are many dogs that are &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: What Beth is getting at is really about genetic modification. We've been concerned about, well, And genetic engineering upsetting to people because it has looked the book of life. It is the essence of the thing. And when you fiddle with that, you're sort of metaphysical level. You're really tweaking it. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yeah, but we've been doing that &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: And so now we're beginning and the whole conversation here, that, oh, the genetic engineering is okay. But it's this large--the larger concerns Ross is putting out on the table, and Beth It's more holistic rather than this kind concern about the-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: Because maybe the future is not it's about just creating life that we want, You look at a wolf and say, "I want a version &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: [inaudible] already. &gt;&gt;TYSON: And we just did that. And there are countryside. We invented the milk cow, right? &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Right. &gt;&gt;TYSON: So we're already doing this. Why wouldn't the future of this exercise &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Because there's too many of us. That is the fundamental problem. [applause] &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: I want to say something about &gt;&gt;TYSON: You brought your family here tonight. [laughter] &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Yes, that's why the clapping &gt;&gt;CHURCH: But there are so many of us, &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Here's what you want to do not to play God, once again, with genetic as endangered. What you want to do is surface dedicated to what lives there now. You want to keep the people out. You want to keep exploitation out. Because that's the only way of going forward. [applause] &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: And how is that not quixotic That just seems to me How are you going to &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: You're calling me quixotic &gt;&gt;TYSON: She didn't call you quixotic. &gt;&gt;GREELY: She is. &gt;&gt;TYSON: She called you naive. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Oh, okay. [laughter] &gt;&gt;GREELY: But quixotic is a good word for it. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: A distinction without a difference. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: It is. And I said, how is that not think that-- &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Do you think it's out of the question the what's there now? &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: I do. I think that there's no way that I think that there's very little-- &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: And what is the fundamental reason &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Because we interact with every even if it's not by touching the surfaces. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Yeah, in simple, it's because there's &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: But we're not going to stop that. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: I'm 68 years old. When I was born, In 2020, it's going to be somewhere on the That is three times in a number &gt;&gt;TYSON: Colonize Mars. Yes. [cheers and laughter] &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Start now, baby. So there has to becomes increasingly irrelevant, it to the fact that people are everywhere &gt;&gt;TYSON: But to Beth's point, how, &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: I'm not arguing that it's not I just think it's-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: Right. She's just saying, she's and saying, it's just not going to happen. Come up with some other idea. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: We're going to continue to turn-- &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: You just gave us--which is [laughter] Or provide birth control information all &gt;&gt;TYSON: George, what? [applause] &gt;&gt;CHURCH: In addition to Mars, there is a called cities. So the fecundity typically drops family &gt;&gt;TYSON: Seven point five? &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Yeah. Why? On average. I mean, you &gt;&gt;TYSON: No, no, I know, [inaudible] wasn't &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: [You have] clean floorboards. &gt;&gt;TYSON: I just don't--it's been a while I met a family that had eight kids, that's &gt;&gt;CHURCH: That's because I'm talking not city kids, rural families where you need have a certain number of children in order sustain the farm. &gt;&gt;TYSON That was back when the kids died &gt;&gt;CHURCH: They still die, actually. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Oh really? &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Sadly, yes. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: So vitamin A deficiency kills about Malaria kills about a million And I could list a few more. In any case, when they move to the city, until they're wealthy, they immediately their expectations of family size. So that's one thing, and also, in the city, You still need the farmland. You could have more efficient farmland. That would be-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: If people live vertically, &gt;&gt;CHURCH: You could just have more And then you could free up some land You can use things that--beef uses up 20 There are all kinds of things you can do &gt;&gt;TYSON: So Ross, you're complaining but as a biologist, I though you successful as a species. [laughter] &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: You did, did you? Okay. [laughter] &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Let's toast to nine billion, [laughter] We need more people. &gt;&gt;TYSON: We've got to land this plane. Hank, you had a point before we try to bring closure here. &gt;&gt;GREELY: Yeah. I think we've reached maybe fundamental issues in environmental policy And that is, do we have to become gardeners Or can we be park rangers? Can we be stewards and preservers of what Or do we actually have to be farmers who plant &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Edit genes. &gt;&gt;GREELY: Yes. And in a world where what's what was here 10,000, 20,000, 30 years ago. And some significant part, although Ross and intervention, the world is, I think, out of because of what we've done. It is not a stable ecosystem. Can we just let it alone and hope that Or do we need to be gardeners? &gt;&gt;TYSON: Right. Biologists on the panel, hardly ever actually stable. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Right. &gt;&gt;TYSON: There's always something out Why do you have locusts &gt;&gt;GREELY: But sometimes it's more [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: The locusts don't think having a population explosion. They're-- &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Right. &gt;&gt;CHURCH They're loving it. &gt;&gt;TYSON: So I've got to land this plane. So Ross, what--you want to create huge We kind of do that, we There's Kruger Park in South Africa. There are places that we know we want to So it's not completely out of the question realistic you can be as a hope for Don't be utopian on me, just be &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Okay, I'll just be naive. [laughter] &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Well you know-- &gt;&gt; SHAPIRO: I'm going to pay for that. [laughter] &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Let's look at what happened Something like two million acres given by the former owner of Patagonia, I mean, [laughter] Now, there was a person, sorry, I'm not Tompkins, right--very committed to to the extent that they bought up a very speaking, and it's now been deeded back That's what it's going to be. You can make the argument, well, is it proper kind of way? I can't answer that, but you must have people in all parts of the planet. And if there is the kind of this sort of thing, then why can't it happen Maybe that's our obligation, that it's to individual species, it's to ecosystems, &gt;&gt;TYSON: In fact, there's a movement now of the ocean that'd be protected from fishing. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Precisely, and that is not a thought-- That is not a thought, I would argue, conservation biologists it did, but it was part of the conversation. Now, we hear about it and we think, If it can be done, why not do it? &gt;&gt;TYSON: Alright, George, first, before I you to make some kind of summative remark, crawl &gt;&gt;CHURCH: One that's already crawling out &gt;&gt;TYOSN: I was just joking. [laughter] So you have a real answer to that question. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: [cough] confession out of [laughter] So pigs that are potential organ donors. So there's--you can make--you can immune-compatible and that they are FDA shut down this idea in 1997. We've now made them virus-free and They seem to be developing normally, so-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: And pigs' organs are approximately &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Same size. &gt;&gt;TYSON: And definitely the same function &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Yes, and certain parts like the not alive. These would be alive and complex &gt;&gt;TYSON: And to anyone who'd say, well, pigs, right, so. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Yes, we eat billions of pigs, [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: You've thought this through, wow. So Greg, so does George suffer from [laughter] &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Actually, George and a number commended for being very open about public thinking about it, appearing on panels There was--a paper came out of George's just a week ago about &quot;SHEEFs&quot;, embryo-like features which you describe But they published this, I think, in order launch discussion about it. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Conversations. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yeah, so that's what we need. Unfortunately, no one really quite knows how these things that can converge on some kind But we need to have the kind of Kevin Esvelt, and a bunch of others in the associated with your lab, have been &gt;&gt;TYSON: So is it possible that your moral can adjust depending on what you've learned I mean, will you--what's your flexibility &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Well, probably too flexible. I tend to--I feel very strongly that the and we need to-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: As any frontier technology is. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yeah. Right. We need to work it This isn't a sort of an all-or-nothing. Whenever we begin to talk about these things, Nature's all over here, it's all humanized, any kind of genetic engineering is bad. That's not where I am on this, and so yeah, in classes, and then within the classes, to eliminate Malaria-carrying mosquitos and think about it. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Beth, is your next book to [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: Is this--do you have a ranking of-- &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO Most important to least important. &gt;&gt;TYSON: most important to least important &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: No, it's not, no. And the really about cloning mammoth. It is, it is a step-by-step manual, but really, ecological challenges associated with bringing interested in anything except dinosaurs. And then, when they find out you can't do But my next book is thinking about with the world around us since we evolved present technology kind of fits into that. This is, is it a logical extension of what agriculture and building cities and dams? Or is it something that is new and different? And that's what I explore. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Hank, you--we didn't flesh out that legislation typically follows what needs to be contained rather than coming The future of this, where does Will they have freedoms, or is it all going and half the people who are scared because &gt;&gt;GREELY: It depends. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Lawyer. [laughter] &gt;&gt; HANK: As a law professor, I tell my question you answer, that your answer it always does. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay, thank you, okay. [laughter] &gt;&gt;GREELY And I actually thought that about de-extinction. It depends on the circumstance. But in terms of your political It depends on what brings it to a head. It depends on how many people have some idea sophistication of it. And you've just added 900 people to that list. For which I thank you. &gt;&gt;TYSON: I would bet your biggest challenge voting on what those laws should be. &gt;&gt;GREELY: Interestingly, it will both be the least biology, but also, a fair number significantly opposed. You can't do pro-science, anti-science based frustrating to me, but that's what the polls &gt;&gt;TYSON: So my last question and then we're So this is 2017, let's say 2050, what does world look like from your--2050, what does Is it going to be a mammoth park? &gt;&gt;GREELY: Well, I'll probably be dead. [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: Okay, next. [laughter] &gt;&gt;GREELY: But I am pretty confident that be claimed to be the revivals of extinct species. I'm even more confident that there'll more synthetic biology out there walking around. Some of it will be in farms, some of it'll in forests, some of it'll be in our houses have We're pretty good at muddling through. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Beth, you going to make a zoo? &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: No. I don't think the intention of &gt;&gt;TYSON: So, in 2050, what does the world &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: There will either be a lot more &gt;&gt;TYSON: Oh. [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: Whoa. &gt;&gt;GREELY: Going out on a limb there. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: I don't think it's likely to be as it is today. &gt;&gt;TYSON: That's completely spooky, actually. &gt;&gt; BETH: I don't know. I tend to be I think that we have a lot of people we're facing in the world, and a lot of who don't, and your question about the biggest is that the biggest hurdle is going to be people to care. I think that extinction, in personally, most people just don't care. The idea that we're going to bring species more or less about causing extinctions But hopefully, we will get ourselves, because of-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: On a panel that reaches [laughter] &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: These people obviously care This is not the right audience then. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Right, right. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: But hopefully, we'll find in a world where people are forced to &gt;&gt;TYSON: So Greg, do you--is there a is absent in the population that you carry we're ready for what comes out of George's [laughter] &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: A bit of moral philosophy that's &gt;&gt;TYSON: You have to study it professionally. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yeah. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Academically. That means it's not &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Oh, ah, no, no, I don't think that One of the weird, one of the sort of or be like wrong it out, If you think of morality ethicists here, we're all charged with thinking &gt;&gt;TYSON So you went to school for no reason? [laughter] [inaudible] George, what's down the pike You'll either be a hero, or you'll be in jail [laughter] &gt;&gt;CHURCH: I think I try to be very responsive like this so that we know what is needed, It's not like it's-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: And as an astrophysicist, I just to my attention, that you know you're into received in multiple ways, and you're And that's a model for all scientists who require, and you would expect, public So, I was very pleased to learn that about &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Yeah, and I think large subsets many different professions and citizens can it's not like there's some giant loophole To introduce a wild species that's been the FDA, the EPA, and the USDA, and animal at least two of those. So we're going to see many more engineered Many of them now will probably be classified where you're moving it from kind of the dividing line for organic foods, They will be cisgenic, that is to say there very subtle changes where you just knock out So I think we're going to be seeing a lot There's 30 different foods already that are because they're so close to natural, clearly engineered than just irradiating and hoping for the best. &gt;&gt;TYSON: So Ross, I just give you the last contemplative of us this evening. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Indeed. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yes. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Okay. Oh, you're not going to give &gt;&gt;TYSON: No, no, no, okay. [laughter] &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: So we've been talking about passenger pigeons and all of these sorts of these are all vertebrates. But in any ecosystem, the organisms as George was just implying. And what I would like to see, if I'm still but nevertheless, you'll tell me, that all the effort, or a lot of the effort, ought to things like doctoring microorganisms really important. So for example, bacteria that produced type of material, of fuel, so we don't so we don't have to do all [applause] &gt;&gt;TYSON: And there are huge economic &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Let me finish. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Alright. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Microorganisms that produce food. I'm not talking Soylent Green. [laughter] What I'm talking about are alternatives [applause] It was mentioned in here earlier, I think George, in fact. &gt;&gt;TYSON: There are six vegetarians in [laughter] &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: For good reason. The amount of that goes into housing cattle, and the amount These are not things we need on the So if there is a future to synthetic biology, for economic reasons, for social reasons, in that kind of direction, to make lives better world &gt;&gt;TYSON: Ross, thanks for those concluding notes. [applause] Ladies and gentlemen, join me in thanking [applause] If you could hang for like, five or 10 minutes, part of our time together, and we've got microphone set up right here and right here. And I haven't forgotten about you guys upstairs, Let's start right here, yes, go ahead. &gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Hello. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Go ahead, right here. &gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Yes. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Can you see where my hand is pointing? Right here, yes, go. &gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: So during this entire speech de-extinction, we talk a lot about the technologies So imagine if like, every human right now and then a new species comes to become the Do you think we deserve to be de-extincted [laughter] [applause] &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: I pers- &gt;&gt;TYSON: Good question. [applause] &gt;&gt;TYSON: Greg, why don't you take that. [laughter] &gt;&gt;AUDIENCE: Because, like... &gt;&gt;TYSON: We got it, we got it. We understand the full implications of that. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: I would love to be de-extincted, But there's the bit about the memories. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yeah, so should humans be may be intrigued by us? And they'll de-extinct us and then put us &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Holocene Park. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: Pleistocene Park, please. &gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Homo ignoramus. &gt;&gt; NEIL: Homo ignoramus, yeah. [laughter] Should we be de-extincted? &gt;&gt; KAEBNICK: Should we be de-extincted? Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt;TYSON: You stumped a philosopher. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: I don't know what to say. I, uh- &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Do you think we should &gt;&gt;TYSON: Ooh, Neanderthal, should we We've got &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: We do. &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yeah. [snapping] [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: Are you there, Greg? [laughter] &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: The problem with de-extincting is that you'd be--they would be stuck in And it would be almost certainly extremely The animal welfare concerns just get first heard your question, I was envisioning population back through some, I don't know, from now when you have a whole &gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: But do we deserve it? &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Do we deserve it? Do we &gt;&gt;TYSON: George wants to be brought &gt;&gt;CHRUCH: I don't know if I deserve it. [laughter] &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yeah, I don't know about deserve. &gt;&gt;TYSON: I would say that in your comment, as being sentient and then no other But people own pigs, which certainly &gt;&gt;KAEBNICK: Yeah, you're right. &gt;&gt;TYSON: You own a pig? Did someone-- [laughter] This is Manhattan. [laughter] But let's keep the questions going. Yes, what do you have here? &gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Yeah, actually, I think on what I was going to ask. But I was going to say, imagine being abducted by aliens, and then you would see, through the world of an animal brought but alone in the world. So what kind of life would this innocent upon it or without nature or even nurture, would they even add to the world without that, without having friends? &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yeah, so that would make an You just got brought back from extinction. What does the world look like to you? It's got to be pretty weird. Or maybe you don't even care, it's just world, and you try to adapt to it. Is that--Beth. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: I don't think there's anyone who believes that they should bring one I mean, I think the goal, as George has said of things that can survive and sustain themselves in the world &gt;&gt;TYSON: They would want to mate, &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Or the idea to use genetic engineering are still alive, to allow them to be able survive and increase their diversity. I think yes, the animal welfare issue is I mean, obviously, we don't-- this panel who would want to bring and I think that's probably a fair thing &gt;&gt;TYSON: Let's go here, yeah. Hi, how you doing? &gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: I was hearing you talk about You talk about parks and preserving parks pockets of parks, but you didn't talk a little bit about these parks could actually disappear And the second thing, if a species that are the brink of extinction, you create them, any thought given to, if there's a reintroduction, animals have to have? Are they actually the same species? The elephant that knows where the where she hasn't been there in 50 years, &gt;&gt;TYSON: I love that question. Beth, why don't you take that? [laughter] &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: The corridors question, the first What we see when we study these populations we can get DNA from these animals starting present day is that as the populations decline, each other. You start seeing a loss of diversity, that are then threatened. And probably, this is because of the loss Animals need to be able to move. This is one of the things that we have done, I think, the most damning for these animals, block these animals from being able to move each other, and absolutely. &gt;&gt;TYSON: So we made the Earth our corridor. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: We made it our corridor at was there. &gt;&gt; NEIL: At the expense of others. And how about the environmental memory &gt;&gt;BETH: Yeah, this is- &gt;&gt;TYSON: So if you know where the watering hole-- might eat you, if you bring a species back what you have just de-extincted? &gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Or a saved species, either one. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: You can create memories. For example, in salmon, if you put them, then they will learn that that's the new to get to from the ocean back up to their &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: But you're right. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: That has been done. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: When there are captive-breeding species, and within some species, there encoded that you see that they can do. And there are other things that they can't and these are things that will be lost. But as George says, they might they'll be learned. I mean, species have an overwhelming This is why we exist. &gt;&gt;TYSON: To not die. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Exactly. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yes. That's life. &gt;&gt; BETH: Yes, to not die. &gt;&gt;GREELY: A true, cool example of this, a crane population that had been moved, ultralight planes guiding the cranes to &gt;&gt;TYSON: The cranes thought that the &gt;&gt;GREELY Yeah. Maybe they weren't [laughter] &gt;&gt; NEIL: I just--you know. Makes you wonder if we get de-extincted to use to fool us? Let's try over here, yes. Sir. &gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Ross, your comments at I don't know how many of you in the panel called The Man in the White Suit. In The Man in the White Suit, indestructible fabric, and made suits out And for a while, he was a hero, but then, losing jobs, and it's sort of very much And you know, greed takes over also. We're living in an era of anti-science, I'm thinking about it from a practical you. I think it'd be a wonderful thing. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Just a quick point, an Does that mean it's bulletproof, &gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Never wore out, couldn't get dirty, nothing. &gt;&gt;TYSON: So that's why--no, we've It's called fashion. [laughter] So that indestructible suit will go and you buy another suit, and that &gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: You're missing my point. [laughter] My point is not the suit. My point is-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: Sorry, I got distracted. You're right. &gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: you're creating a situation agrees with. &gt;&gt; NEIL: It's an unintended consequence, Ross? &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Yeah, I'm not entirely clearly, You mean using microorganisms to produce our &gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Right, right, and all of that, &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: As opposed to agribusiness &gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Think about what'll happen create the other industries? You'll get enormous blowback. I guess that's what I'm driving at. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Unless that creates such a who properly trained for it. So, you're-- &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: This is like coal in America. Coal ain't coming back. [applause] &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: The only way coal is ever going to be sources if somebody really learns how to You may have heard the recent announcement &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Very clean. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: We're not. &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Very clean. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Not with any existing technology. It is just simply a bad idea. But what happens with technology is, you see a need, you put brainpower against and one hopes, over time, that you develop that propels the new technology. And my view is that we really are at that at this point in human existence. You do not need to put very large parts of planet under tillage or supporting animals It's really the only way forward is, So The Man in the White Suit analogy is true I'm assuming it was a white suit, technology is just going to stop there. One hopes that with further insights and the absolute best one can with the materials that it's going to be an upward trajectory centuries. &gt;&gt;TYSON: I would also say that something that we had horses as a fundamental part of our And then, over a 20-year period, from like, basically went out of business. The buggy whip, you couldn't a part of your life, cars took over, and that on a historical timeline. So such changes can happen, putting whole ones, So I see there may be a mixture of where just completely embrace the change. We have time for just a couple, just a few We've got a kid online, could you just Just come forward. Yeah, no, [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: Oh you can, yeah, [inaudible] come here, Here. How are you doing? How old are you? &gt;&gt; KID: Nine. &gt;&gt;TYSON: You're nine? You're nine? &gt;&gt; KID: Yes. &gt;&gt;TYSON: So I was nine years old when I first me into the planetarium. And I was star-struck. [laughter] Yeah, yeah, that actually happened to me. So you have a question. Why don't you face everyone and say the Turn around. &gt;&gt; KID: Beth talked about bringing back mammals, about them? She said caring about them more, so if we &gt;&gt;TYSON: I like that question because what now don't exist. But now, you bring them back, And then their novelty wears off. So what's up with that? &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: I think this actually goes to what talking about where he said that one thing if we do, do this, if we do eventually have through the ethics, and we've thought through we bring them back, that we really then have and care about and preserve the species that And Ross brought this up. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yeah, but without the novelty, &gt;&gt;SHAPIRO: Well, it has to come from us, which that we somehow convince people that humans are valuable, that having a diverse meaning many different species of many that are healthy and robust, lives. And this is hard, [laughter] &gt;&gt;CHURCH: I don't think-- &gt;&gt;KID: Yes. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yes. Okay, thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt;CHURCH: I don't think novelty wears off, We still love dogs, and they're not novel But we like the ancient breeds just as much &gt;&gt;TYSON: The wolves are still pissed off asked them. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: That's fair enough. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Alright, I want to take--excuse for everyone online, but I'm only going two more questions just because we're running Right over there, yes, go ahead. &gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: I have one. I'm a non-scientist questions, But one was about Casper 9 technology, which and progressing. And I don't see how you can wrap And the other is about microbiodiversity we what you &gt;&gt;TYSON: Hank, is that you? &gt;&gt;GREELY: Sure. I think the international issues We have tried very hard to keep other countries There's a treaty signed by almost every country Making nuclear weapons is incredibly expensive, have done it. Making CRISPR'd organisms is cheap and easy, There's no way we're going to be able to over this. &gt;&gt;Tyson: Just by contrast, I have to say-- &gt;&gt;GREELY: We'll do the best we can. &gt;&gt; TYSON: If you're going to purify plutonium But what you're doing, George, is in a lab. &gt;&gt; GREG: You can get a kit for 150 bucks. &gt;&gt; NEIL: Yeah. Okay. [laughter] &gt;&gt;GREELY: Basically it takes a, I'm in New so forgive me, a garage-- &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yeah, a garage. &gt;&gt;GREELY: But a garage-sized space and start doing this. So the international regulation going to be perfect at it. That's been true for a while with than nukes. What we've done isn't perfect, but And I think that's the world we're guarantee security either from biological that happen because of bioengineering, to see better monitoring is crucial. We've got some plans for how we may fix and we are, we're staying alert. So that's--I wish I had a better answer, I hope we could get that good. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Alright, ladies and gentlemen, Yeah, hey. &gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Is this thing--yeah. Okay, one for you, Doctor Tyson, you've Are you going to be doing a talk here as &gt;&gt;TYSON: Oh, no, actually. [laughter] It was--yeah, well, no. Yeah, it was-- the book talk there. &gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Okay, now for the panel. &gt;&gt;TYSON: Yeah. Okay. [laughter] &gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Okay, with the-- extinct species, wouldn't that cause people extinct because, oh well, we can bring them It'll less people-- less interested in what we have because they could be brought &gt;&gt;GREELY: Yes. &gt;&gt;CHURCH: It could, but it could also do by battle let's just hang in there, it's a very conversation than if you say, "Oh, we can on occasion." I think that's a different conversation new sources of--whole new resources. But we shouldn't neglect the argument that expensive it is to bring back a species, against letting them go extinct in the first &gt;&gt;GREELY: I'm waiting for senators from next time the Endangered Species Act de-extinction research, the worst thing in things back, and so therefore, we can go ahead And there's been enough talk and enough I think people believe we can do things that The worst situation would be to do that and Being able to bring them back provides always stress the importance of keeping That's a heck of a lot easier than trying bring them back is going to be. [applause] &gt;&gt;TYSON: If I can offer some summative remarks, some of these comments, but I think I will. &gt;&gt;MACPHEE: Is that a bad thing? [laughter] &gt;&gt;TYSON: So I do a lot of reading on, so, to countries, nations, and civilization. And one of the things people do first is This has been with us from the beginning. In 1940, a new element was discovered that and this was 10 years after the object, [laughter] So this element was named in honor of Within five years, we had weaponized it, tested in Almogordo, was not the uranium bomb, This is what countries do, and the United did not invent war, it goes back as long as So my concern, my hope, because I'm not you guys are, is that we as a species, as as a civilization, that we have the wisdom how to harness this for good, for the good, for happiness, for food, whatever it is, that urge to do good with it will be greater than urge to do bad with it. And I worry on occasion that we don't have in the future, there'll either be very many certainly won't be the same. All of you, thank you for coming to this. [applause] And thanks again for our brilliant panel. [applause]
