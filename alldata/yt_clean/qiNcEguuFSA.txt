A problem worthy of attack proves its And that's what Fermat's last theorem was So we are talking about Fermat's last theorem I Pierre de Fermat, he was a 17th-century France - not working as a mathematician but working as a judge. Every evening he'd go one evening he was looking at an which looks a bit like Pythagoras' X squared plus Y squared equals Z And he was looking for whole number lots, you know there's 3 squared plus 4 squared, 5 squared. So that's a &lt;b&gt;x^2 + y^2 = z^2&lt;/b&gt;. &quot;What if I change this equation so what about if it's x cubed or x to Are there solutions to that equation? So &lt;b&gt;x^n + y^n = z^n&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;x^n + y^n = z^n&lt;/b&gt; where &lt;b&gt;n&lt;/b&gt; is bigger than 2. Does that have any whole number solution?&quot; He and couldn't find any whole number further: not only could he not find any whole he believed he found an argument, he that showed without any doubt there were no whole number solutions. So because we have one equation that has not just one solution, it of solutions. And then we have an infinite number of &lt;b&gt;x^4 + y^4 = z^4&lt;/b&gt;, an infinite number of equations which And Fermat discovered it's proof, and he in the margin of a book he was reading he wrote in the margin in his book, he which this margin is too narrow to &lt;i&gt;Hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet&lt;/i&gt; In other words: &quot;I know how to prove that but I don't have the space to write it It very much was a secret proof which he and after his death his son, Samuel Clemant I think, rediscovered this book which had &lt;i&gt;I have a truly marvelous proof - which these margins are too narrow to these little annoying notes: &quot;I can prove this but I gotta go and wash my hair.&quot; So Fermat was quite annoying in this So his son published a new version of the - the Arithmetica by Diophantus - notes printed in the text. And people and they were: &quot;Fermat And one by one people rediscovered the And every case where Fermat said proof, except in this one example here. Fermat's last theorem is called Fermat's anybody could actually find the proof for. anyone can prove it's the most precious one, it's the one And the more that people try, the more And this goes on for decades, it goes Right through to the 20th century were to rediscover what Fermat's proof might [Brady]Is that they have widely-held that he was he telling the truth? [Singh]I think by the that this is an incredibly simple to jot down in a few scribbles describe the problem. The proof is clearly profound and probably beyond Fermat's reach to Some people say Fermat was just fooling that he left something in his book that he knew I think that's the least likely. Some people say that he did have a and it's beautiful, it's elegant and it's and we could kinda rediscover that I think that's possible but unlikely. I think the most likely explanation is Fermat thought he had a proof. Because he was working and because he didn't show this proof to nobody could tell him: &quot;Ow, there is a mistake has got something wrong with it.&quot; And subsequent generations of mathematicians thought they'd found a proof and then it apart and find the error. So what we're looking for is not Fermat's which was probably flawed - but we're wheter Fermat was right all along? And it starts with a ten-year-old child, a child called Andrew Wiles, who was reading a he's growing up in Cambridge, he wents to problem&lt;/i&gt; by E.T. Bell. And the book is all about And little Andrew Wiles, age 10, decided that he was going to rediscover the Because a bright ten-year-old can doesn't realize what they're letting but that's another story. And he school teachers about the problem, he talked to his A-level teachers about the undergraduate lecturers about the problem. He has a PhD and still this problem is I think he was about in his late 30's by there was something called the I kinda think we don't really which had been proposed in the 50's. So a we don't know whether it's true or not, proved that there was a link between It is much as: if you could prove most of you would get Fermat's last theorem for free. this other conjecture. And Andrew Wiles' childhood passion, his because he thinks the Taniyama-Shimura You know he thinks he can get his teeth a crazy thing to try and do and so ambitious challenge, Wiles didn't tell anybody He worked on in complete secrecy, he started not attending committee less and less, he started to focus on this problem. Once again: not because it was the Taniyama-Shimura Fermat's last theorem for free. And for 7 years he worked in complete and at the end of 7 years he that he had Taniyama-Shimura and he had a proof of Fermat's last theorem. He went black board, it was a three-part lecture, the world New York Times, he was on CNN he was everywhere. But the is that in any mathematical proof you You have to have it refereed and published, and somebody found a mistake. Wiles assumed but the more he tried to unravel this And it became a huge embarrassment, you know mathematician of the 20th century, you are a hero figure and now you have to And it took a whole year, but at the end Andrew Wiles working with a chap(?) managed to fix the proof. I think the Terminator film, I often talk about, slained the monster when you've killed you have to fight in one last time. Pete Hines once wrote: &lt;i&gt;&quot;A problem worthy of attack proves its worth by fighting back.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; And it was fighting back, but Wiles proved that he was too good. And of is that Fermat was right, this equation &lt;b&gt;x^n + y^n = z^n&lt;b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;n&lt;/b&gt; bigger than 2, has no whole number solutions and that's [Brady]If you'd like to see a bit more from extra footage, I'll put a link in the description. Simon's theorem, that's excellent, I recommend that, links below, and just this week he's got funny about that - it's all about anyone who likes Numberphile is gonna I'll put a link below, but he's also done an about Fermat's last theorem in the which I think you'll all enjoy and I'll put But in the meantime, lots of links below a few other bits and pieces that I want so have a good look.
