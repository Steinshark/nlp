[APPLAUSE] Good afternoon. Before I begin, I to respond to these vicious-- [LAUGHTER] --allegations by a And I'll ask you What's more plausible, that to tear someone's ACL or someone getting out of-- yeah-- even applause. You hear that, Jason? Now that we have that out of there were these heavy And these books And this notion been around for a has been really baked into since the very beginning. We talk about how many web This web page failed to load. Brad, how long is the home And this language how we go about doing our jobs. But now, of course, we all We have all these all these different scenarios, screen sizes, widths, and so on So this notion of the page just Just out of morbid work in a place that has to Anybody? This is a safe place. It's OK. It's all right. And it's always the iPhone. It's always the iPad. And it's always, like, a if someone's feeling especially And this is what we And it's like, look, this is We tilt them slightly factor from the client. But this just doesn't work. This just doesn't scale. This is nothing more than of a talented designer's time. So I think we [IMITATING EXPLOSION] --blow up this notion of literally, though, also blowing Really, we have to ask are our interfaces made of? What are our UIs made of? What are the web's LEGO bricks? What are the web's that we combine these different combinations? We're not designing pages. We're designing This is how we have to approach Anybody use Foundation with it or anything? Where my Bootstrap people at? Look at all those hands. This is what these these systems of components, allow us to just assemble to form whatever UI we want. I love these things. I love these things in theory. Again, we're getting away systematic design. This is my problem Look at all these And whenever I'd watch I could never shake this I'm like, I guess just if given Some person's like, wear jumpsuits from now on? And everybody's like, sure. I'm fine with that. Check. Let's move on to the next thing. But of course, we we all have different needs. We all have different different goals. So this notion of a doesn't necessarily make sense And that's what these solutions give us. Jen talks about the sameness. We see the same layout Well, it's because half the And again, that's not to using a UI framework or It's just about keeping If Nike, Adidas, to all redesign their they would look That's not what These frameworks give Sometimes they give and we don't end up using it. But our users have to incur all which Laura and [? Yesenia ?] about-- bad for performance. On the flip side, they and you have to write custom and How do you work into your existing framework? And I'd say also you have to subscribe called their modules, Bootstrap has something Does that make sense Maybe, maybe not. So Dave Rupert, local Austin Paravel, a great design agency-- they did a redesign And Dave talked about what and he brought up this really So it's &quot;tiny Bootstraps, And he said that should look a lot Twitter Bootstrap-style for your clients' needs.&quot; That last part is the custom-tailored for It's not just about using a It's about taking the time system, one that makes and for your clients that So that's what's given rise libraries, style guides. Anna Debenham calls them and so building your And these things are fantastic. And I love seeing them. They promote across your entire They make testing easier, testing for performance, and things like that. They establish a better the different people creating this shared vocabulary. So whenever somebody says, knows what that is. So you don't get these for the same thing. It's a useful reference And finally, pattern this future-friendly to live with your and roll in best practices into your design system There's a bunch out there to help create Jeremy Keith speaking called Pattern Primer-- loops through all of and spits them Paul Robert Lloyd took that a calls Barebones. Whenever you look-- you'll see there's what paragraphs look like, lists, vertical link Here's what our forms look like. Here's what our Here's what notes about Here's what our And so in addition there's all these guides that have been Code for America's is definitely recommend MailChimp has I think, like, third on this, which is really cool. Yelp released theirs. But it really all Has everybody seen this, So they went responsive, like, And whenever they release they release their documented all the patterns So they have things So here's this to be using a bunch You're able to resize a browser test it in isolation across different viewpoints. Here's a features table with a headline, and an excerpt-- again, pretty common pattern. They're going to be using this You solve the problem once Data tables-- here's a pretty easy. That's going to squish quite But then here's a more And how's that going to So I love these. I think absolutely, need to be approaching projects in 2015 and beyond. Anna Debenham and I created which rounds up a lot of the guides, articles, and so on and so forth-- have a podcast where people who have successfully So you could check that out. But so as great as they're time-consuming I don't know about go into work every what I'm going to do today. Maybe I'll make a It's like, no. We're under the gun to Everybody's like, It's already behind schedule. So this idea that a this separate thing than working on impedes progress, from happening because it might sound nice to But it's like, we just need So sorry. We want to do this. But it's just going Very often, these they're great. They show Blocks Three-Up. But you don't get an idea of utilized, what does that Very often, they're only seen a best-kept secret from within the organization. Very often, they're only and only serving the Maybe your organization doesn't but maybe that becomes a bigger Wouldn't it be nice to already of time? And then the last is the thing that I think is that I felt-- I see all these style guides these are fantastic. But at the same like loosely organized And I'm like, to more deliberately create these UI design systems. So that's what I'm And whenever I was I'm like, well, how-- surely there are that we could pull And I kept coming back to my and having to deal with like that. So in the natural which are the basic building They can't be broken without ceasing to be They're sort of an They're not terribly But these atoms combine Hydrogen, oxygen join together-- Now together, that It can do new things. Those molecules keep into more complex molecules, into organisms, simple further together into into a human being. And I did a Google search for And this guy came up. And I'm like, yeah, You're going in my talk. That was a good So all matter in I kept him in there-- is comprised of this finite And this just a beautiful The vastness and all the is comprised of a finite set And as it turns out, we This guy, Josh Duck, who came up with the periodic which I think is a It's like so here's here's our table markup, like that. So I think that this is a of HTML tags and stuff. But because we're starting of building blocks, maybe we that happens in the natural So that's what atomic design or I should say a collection, that all happen collectively It's not like a step one, It's just more a to go about crafting but the underlying design So five stages-- atoms, templates, pages. Starting with atoms, have their own They can't be broken down any terribly useful on their own. What are our atoms? Things like labels, These things can't be But again, they're not Then we get to the And we're taking those atoms to form these relatively Now all of a sudden, that label Now all of a sudden, will submit that form. So you have this little, component that you could We get to the organism stage. And we take this, take and put that into context And we see this on every You go to a website to see a collection of that are working a header, a footer, And it might be disparate a unordered list, a or it could be a product grid-- organisms repeated Then we get to templates. So we take these relatively and now we put them, into context of something So the big thing here is that even though we're of our deliverables, and stuff like that. We're starting to see that But the big thing focusing on that underlying What are the image What are the character and so on and so forth? It's about seeing that content skeleton, laid bare. And then finally, at the is we're taking that in the template and we're content into that template. Now obviously, this is an because this is ultimately going to interact with. And this is ultimately what your on and what your colleagues and all of that stuff. But this stage is also to test the underlying-- the resiliency of those of those underlying What happens when you poor real into these patterns? Do they hold up, yes or no? And if things look wonky or whatever, you need to at a more atomic level. And pages also give to test variations of templates. What does it look like image plugged into it? What does it look like if on the your account was just hacked It's still the same but it's a variation So this page stage gives to show all of the of a particular template. So collectively, these again, it's more is a step-by-step process. Nobody's saying design your and then cross your fingers and to form a cohesive whole. We need to simultaneously as the parts of that whole. And atomic design gives with which to do that. So I've been working this way And what I like is that it gives me the the opportunity to traverse I'm able to see everything and pieces-- into those But I'm also able to through how all of those to form the eventual And I've also found that give a crap about atoms and And that's OK. That's all right. Understandably so, is this going to cost me? They care more about and that's understandable. It's like, they want to see what But that hasn't stopped me from to them, showing them that, you a new shiny web site. We're crafting you this really design system that you can use with over time. So even though care about what the to look like, it's I think, to expose them It's also important to working on the web. But really, this is just a for really any UI-- your bank's kiosk, So here you could see Instagram to it. So at its core, Well, you got some icons. You have a couple And you have a the user avatar image And you're able to see these to form these sections And then at the organism and potatoes of Instagram's So here's this is comprised of the avatar, the of course, itself, for that photo and the and stuff like that. So that is the cornerstone And then we're able to put that And then, of course, we're able to pour in real into that. So that's the philosophy, the In order to actually myself, along with a who works at West we made a tool And Pattern Lab is It's an open source tool-- But it's a way to all of these atoms, molecules, to actually craft not front-end code, but also the And the end goal of this is for every client. This becomes our deliverable. It gives us some patterns and provides some other design What it isn't, though, It's not Foundation by Zurb. You still have to do You still have to do all yourself. Pattern Lab's just there to In fact, you could actually or whatever within Pattern Lab. It's not language-, library-, You like SAS? Cool. Go for it. If you like jQuery, cool. Go for it. If you don't like those It's not rigid. I talk to a lot of people-- in fact, just at lunch, even. People are like, yeah, But we don't like this And I'm like, I am not offended, as I cry No. But it's fine. It's about establishing the for you and your team. It's also not &quot;just&quot; a pattern been using it to create code. But it's also not a replacement or anything like that. You still have to plug your management system. So here's what it looks like-- looks like shit-- actually, to really drive home yeah, you still need to do We're not giving you any We're just trying to give to traverse between all of your and so on. So starting with things like our color palette. These are the elemental aspect of our UIs. So it's good to articulate those library. Font stacks-- also very to articulate. But even invisible those are things that consistent throughout our UIs. So maybe that's a good Those default within the But also here's our headings, text elements, horizontal rules, square images, avatars, icon all of those elemental building buttons, form fields, But again, the to give you some stuff But of course, you could add or So at the molecule stage, we're using Pattern these reusable components. So this is a project I did publishing company. And so this is a pretty if I do say so myself. [INAUDIBLE] actually But you have a title. You have an excerpt. And you have a We're going to be using that Here's another pattern-- 400 by 300 thumbnail image, again, common pattern. You probably see this on a But so these were some of In order to actually we use a templating language these things together. So in order to create you look at the you see a little bit of HTML. Block post is what we're And all those bits in orange look like little are Mustache Code. So we have a dynamic URL. We have a dynamic headline And so that's going to But for now, I'm filling images and the lorem ipsum. But the big thing here is So what we're doing is we're So I'm saying, hey, an atom called &quot;thumb,&quot; that 400 by 300 image. So what Pattern Lab I'm going to go find and suck it into this So now I have this little that I can now use that same to include in even So at the organism at their header for the site, you could see there's a logo, there's a little search And so whenever you look you see a little header tag. And then we're We're including the primary We're including the And again, once we then we could include that into our templates. So you can see It's just like It's just like the little in the bigger things which are and so on. And what this does is-- by it allows us to and any instance of that pattern It's amazing. It's like, this broke or or it's not performing So instead of having through every instance of or whatever, it's like, update the pattern. And anywhere that's included So then we get into So again, the template that underlying which is really super editors themselves, but but also for the to know the rules and the So we have this big hero image. We have a little headline And as we scroll down, you repeating again and again. So all we're doing is the same way that the other patterns, we're wrapping them So we're wrapping the hero in thing. And that's just to give in handy at the next stage. So the page stage-- again, is replacing that with real, actual content. So in the case of taking this home I will say doesn't at the template level. But we're replacing that with as I found out on this project, quickest way to get pictures of Beyonce. [LAUGHTER] Beyonce is universally It's like the fast-track So even if you're a or you're working on some site or whatever, all the stakeholders Sure. This looks great. Ship it-- pro tip. So you could see, again, we're with the picture of Beyonce. We're replacing our tag line moving people or whatever. You could see that we now have with the dynamic headline here. And as we scroll all of those patterns with different content. These different now have their own And the way that is by swapping out some JSON. So we have a default data JSON here is that grayscale image. Here is that lorem ipsum text. And then we're going and saying, for the to be moving people instead And instead of that I want to swap that out with or whatever. Sorry. All the responsive image I'm still reeling from this as a web developer. Anyways, Experience-- We're swapping in for We're saying, I want-- instead I want the hero_skater.jpg. And I want to give it this and so on and so forth. And this allows us, this notion of Don't repeat yourself. You're able to have a pattern. And if you want to make a bunch you could do that. And by changing just that you can make all these great and pump it full So you're creating between the underlying and the data that goes It also includes which is sort of a nerdy name. I didn't come up with that. But you might have let's say you have a web app or The user logs in And maybe it has all of and so on and so forth. But maybe you have Maybe you have an to switch on additional controls so things like edit buttons that a regular Well, with Pattern Lab, you do that by defining a little true. And inside your say, if the user show this additional stuff. So it won't be there by helps keep things dry from having to duplicate document in order to just add So in addition to all of these atoms, molecules, and pages, we also And it's really apparent that values like is an iPhone 4 in portrait which is an iPhone 4 in an iPad in portrait an iPad in landscape these values just They have no place inside of queries, inside of our The fold-- oh god, the fold-- that old conversation. So we made a tool called ish. And that's baked And the reason why is that you click and it gives you a You click on the it gives you another Click on the medium button. It gives you a and so on and so forth. So you get the idea. What we're doing is this point across to our to ourselves, even, creating for the popular It's our job, our as web designers to UIs, that are going beautifully no matter So that's what ish does. There's also that client So you turn on disco bounces all over the place. And the client loves it. And they're like, And this is amazing. It's sort of cheeky. It's not exactly the tool in the world. But again, it's just there And that's like, yeah, we're interfaces. There's also us to suck in all of that really gets thrown away inside of somewhere and actually breathing code. And you could see And you could also see it So this was for able to say, blah, blah, blah. Our fonts are and so on and so forth-- makes documentation There's also this I mentioned earlier with a lot of different out there because you don't like where do these Where does Blocks Well, within Pattern doing that include type setup, approach, we could pull out. We could say this pattern, contains the this atom square, this that I'm rounding with CSS. And it says this pattern is patterns. It's included in the some pattern called section settings, and our So what makes this really if this breaks or if I I know exactly where I need things and make sure that So it automatically does There's a bunch of other stuff. We're working on a new version. And again, it's an And I'm not really here to In fact, that worries me. I'm not here to sell I think that all those features are good considerations no strategy or tool I think that they're just good But if you do want to check If things go wrong, That is my way of washing So we got a methodology. We have a way of executing But then there's is how the hell do we update to make this stuff happen? And I asked a while ago. I said, what's the hardest Is it responsive images, is or is it updating your Just overwhelmingly, people Mark Boulton has He says, the design process because it involves people I think that that's So I had the good fortune of we were able to a sound, responsive what a good process for a pattern-based One of these projects was a responses site for which is a technology and Time Inc, which So I'll just walk we did to execute these went, all in all, pretty well. So the first thing people's expectations. This look familiar to anybody? Let's review the website. Book the conference room. Bill's going to and print off a copy of You awkwardly make waiting for Bill to come back. Bill comes back, passes around You get out the red pens. This is about as far away from as you could get. Dan Mall, who I had of working with on these &quot;As an industry, we to sell websites like paintings. Instead, we should be selling to content, agnostic of device, And I just absolutely So in order to accomplish have to kill this outdated, process. You know what I'm talking about. A client comes. You get the project. And then some UX designer or interaction designer want to call them-- they go away. And they make this 200-page PDF. And we show it to the client. What do you think? They're like, yeah, we talked about and cool. For the most part, sure. And then it's like, all right. Cool. And then they pass that And the visual designer takes inside the line-- no. I'm just kidding. They apply thoughtfully and texture and all that And we come back to the client. And we say, what do you think? And they're like, yeah. Yeah. This looks pretty good. This feels right and Can we just-- we're like, yeah. Yeah. Sure. No problem. And then we go away. And we're like-- and And then we're like, version And they're like, yeah. Yeah. That's great. That's exactly what This is cool. Can we just do a little-- Sure. No problem. And then we go away. And then we do-- and then we come back. And we're like, version And they're like, yeah. That's awesome. I really like what Can we bring a And we're like, yeah. Sure. Sure. And then we're like-- and we do this until eventually fordevreview forbrad v17finalfinal.psd. Page And then very quietly, gets approved, the over to the code cave, slips as they tiptoe away. They're like, please get We're already behind time and And they run off And then the developers And they pick up the And they're like, You're all a whole [LAUGHTER] Hear clapping because And of course, this what we need to be doing I suffer from an And Eric introduced me. He's like, design Whenever I get hired at what do you do? And I said, well, mostly and JavaScript And they're like, Well, we've got a place for you. Go over and sit with Whip us up some gems. [LAUGHTER] And I'm like, yeah. And they're like, is it going to take you And I'm like, my mom I have never had a computer This is very Yes, I am writing code. I'm writing HTML and CSS I'm more akin to and to the wireframey am to the database, normalizing, So it's a very weird in the front-end boat. And I see some nodding heads. It's like, yeah, I think through this identity crisis. But at the same time, the people that are actually actually have their and know the realities what's possible. Jen's talk is so like, Photoshop designers aren't like that. So it really requires of all of these disciplines in order to actually And that's not to to be guns blazing and that the project wall out everybody's No, that's not it. In our experience, it looks where, of course, at the the information architect or they're burning hot. They're producing They're making a lot But that doesn't mean the visual designer, need to sit on their hands. There's a lot that can be done. So that's resetting with ourselves, Once we get into that, then we So in addition to doing and competitive research we could also start setting library. So this is a tool allows you to take any URL-- you slap it in there-- and it goes through all the colors and font families you use on your production CSS-- pretty cool. It's like, boom. Hey, there's a style guide, or So this is a great tool to what is our UI made of? Another exercise I find is what I call an And if you're familiar that a content inventory laborious process that execute a redesign hopefully-- but even though it's it's tremendously beneficial. So we could do that same of documenting our we're documenting So this is my bank. Do you feel sorry for me? It's pretty rough right here. And this is just going These are just some of the So this idea of the allows us to go documenting all these and saying, yeah, here's are looking like. Here's what our buttons Here's our icons, our our different block elements, elements, our tables, and so on and so forth. And if you contrast my bank runs a very tight style you could see that their a hell of a lot more deliberate and cohesive. As Laura mentioned these opportunities to look for an opportunity to merge together, blend these things some stuff off. And that's not just That's great for establishing style guide that you could live again and again. So conducting an is tremendously helpful. You're documenting You're highlighting all You're establishing for refactoring things into And you're really laying that guide or pattern library-- so helpful to have touch a site or an app in one room all doing because this is where that gelling. You have people go, oh, I call And then the other call this primary button. And the developers go, And so you start about, well, what do and then also having about, well, which Which pattern should go? Which ones could These are all really And the end result you're able to take-- I usually use Google Slides and all into one uber document. And you could print that out You look at all and they don't need to be-- a yeah, that's problematic. We should probably do So it's a great Once we're done with start establishing A friend of mine is a preschool And one day, one of how do you make a website? And my friend was like, we're friends with-- I have a friend So they gave us a FaceTime call. And Eva, the how do you make a website? And I was like, a good idea to draw you want that website to be. And about an hour later, I from my friend. And I looked at it. And I'm like, that's awesome. And I looked at it again. And I was like, holy shit. This girl is better than I've ever worked with-- clear labeling, proper freaking active states. She's six. It's insane. Here's the home page. So you have, again, beautiful more active states. Her freaking buttons are It's awesome. And what I love about a six-year-old is able I could build this I could build this right now. And I think that we-- I don't know why we do this, need to have all of these especially early in the process. In the wire framing stage we do all these 200-page PDF And it's like, we We just need to Jason Santa Maria He says, ideas are It's about getting those into the final as possible to more sooner those ideas. So I had the good fortune of who's an amazing designer. She used to work at And this was some of the to our TechCrunch client. So her sketching tool One of the first things we we're going to have a that we're going to throughout the experience. So we're going to And you could see it's There's nothing. There's no content. There's no lorem ipsum. There's no layout. There's no nothing. It's just like we're going going to feature some stuff. And we're going to we're going to list a in some particular order. And we're going to contain some stuff as well. So this is what we're talking getting the point the clients get on board with And from a visual instead of coming out these full-fledged comps, like style tiles, which in the past and stuff. Instead of coming out of the comps, it's like an idea of what and what they don't value, what Show them color suggestions or or textures, things like they actually care about-- and same thing goes We use a tool called Typecast to And Dan Mall would show them. Here are some different Here's what we have in mind-- and would number them. And we'd say, here's why And the sort of looking for from the I really like the feel of that or this feels a little or this feels too And so we're able to get a care about and what they don't a whole hell of a lot of work. And from a front-end I was able to get started coding day one of the project. And I don't think that that is I think that what a lot is the equivalent of what a In the restaurant, you They come in. And they're preparing the salads and they're chopping the and all that stuff in advance into the restaurant everyone can work together to meals rather than somebody I need to go chop 70 carrots. So I think that we to do a better job at doing that preparation work, so collaborating with designers, involved in the project. So for the TechCrunch knew we were going to have I knew we were going I knew we were going to use a I knew we were going I knew this was a publication. So we'd have things like knew this thing was So instead of pretending which whatever, we could and make spots for those and as quickly as possible. So once we're done have this prep have a firm, solid, then we can really And from a wireframe stage-- this is Jennifer's And this is as high-fidelity It's just here's what and in what general order. That's all it needs to be. And we'd have conversations And what's great about this look over her shoulder and And so this is, like, two weeks And I have the home page It looks like crap. But that's OK. I'm just doing this-- stitching things together, done together, work done so that on the actual design later. And Dan would do what he is applying those style tiles and having-- again, having conversations how's this feeling? This isn't necessarily This is more like, are we Does this feel on-brand? Does this feel like still pretty exploratory. But we'd be able to take particular high-profile and design that and put and have a conversation. And all the while, I'd again, putting that And as we'd have our I'd be there making and stuff like that. So it's really nice. And we are able to arrived at our final solutions. And so we'd end up where some components but the other ones wouldn't be. And if you look at it's like, what A client would be But because we're constantly with them, they're They're seeing So instead of saying, what is they're rather saying, oh, That's cool. Let's make more progress. It's only really here that So once we have a good idea and some main patterns a good idea around that, and put it all together. And we missed the mark And we had to do a V2 But once we started getting we put a gray line or could we move this here Cool. We'll do that. But we're going to do rather than creating yet It's just a lot easier So that became our process. We have design going on. We have development We're putting in that design-- into the live-- into across the different viewpoints, this stuff, validating and decisions. What's fascinating is doing a lot of the work in we figured out through the this is weird because that he was doing in Photoshop It was for my eyes only. It was for us to solve And we'd work together to And then we'd show them So we're not doing waterfall. So you must be doing agile. I get that a lot. Agile's a loaded word. But yeah, at the end of It's like, I don't think so. It doesn't really matter I think that the that the collaboration and the disciplines with matters more than whatever the And it matters more than you end up creating. So this is our reality. This is our tear-inducing And this is really hard. It's really difficult to change. But it's absolutely And this line from Benjamin rings true today. &quot;When you're finished And I think that that's that's only 25 years old. And for as hard as it's a hell of a lot of fun. I played with a lot I don't know about you all. But this ain't all And I think that's pretty cool. We just get paid for it now. That's pretty awesome. So with that, if you're I'm writing a book You could pre-order it. It's all live online now. You could pre-order it for So with that, thank you [APPLAUSE]
