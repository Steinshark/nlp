But these zombies are kind of hot tho. [Stupid Alan hadn't decided to run away.] -Fun fact- -Yeah. It's actually the same living room that we use in all of our living rooms. All the time, Christmas! We use the same living room. All the episodes. Same. This. Wooow. I love the blue contact lenses. Nobody can even tell that this room is the same. Honestly, I think this shot is one of the, I don't know why it's touching because you know you're trying too hard but you cannot it's like- [You] -No way You know! Like, by the way, why am I saying it's your time- Yeah, iconic line. Woah. Ooh. Wow. Thank you. The nails, the lips, the syringe, the colors all match. That's so scary if you really think about it, so scary. This one! This, honestly, I've never seen the shots and I don't really remember. Same. Duh. Ah! Oh, wait! We're late! Another iconic line! I love that Iconic line! Lenchik. [Do you think he likes me?] [Chelsea?] Woah. It was a dream. Wow. Side-eye. Bombastic, criminal, offensive side-eye. Alan. What'd you just say? Every time I see Alan in the scenes, I always cry. I don't know why. Just... Alan A-School no last name. There are a lot of I guess, Alan's in A-school. You can Google it all the time.

Oh, the... Those three crazy... I love how she says that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nothing but a failed experiment, Alan. Debbie's so short. Debbie's insane. Debbie's so short? She's so cute. This will cure you from the virus and end your human life forever. Why human? You're a zombie. I wonder. It's not too cool if you have to be a human. Oh yeah, okay. Chelsea said don't do this. No, no, no, stop. [Your plan will never work.] Funny. For now. [And what are you going to do?] [No one can stop us now.] Wow. [I read your secret record.] [And found something interesting.] You remember those photos? [The doctor is using you.] What does it say? [After you're done helping her,] [she'll end your life too.] [Don't believe her!] Wow Wow. The decision was immediate. You guys switched up real quick. I leave the moment when Miss Debbie fell. Noooo! Did she do stunts or something? [I'll die too] [and we can't be together] -Aww the way you said that. Then Nick, imagine. [An antidote for A-virus.] [Only true love can cure the infected from the virus.] If a zombie feels true human love... Aw. Only love. Only love. Close your eyes. I think I know them. Oh my god. You can open your eyes now. Don't talk. Oh my gosh. Alan, did you do the makeup? My makeup. True love. What about them? Let's kiss them too. Yeah! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Awwww! Is this true love? Yeah we just love everyone. Officially we love each other! Wow. I think she's a vampire. Let's kiss! [We can conquer the world when we have each other.] This, this scene? Clap for ourselves! Nobody cares. Ooh! Back to normal life. I forgot about this scene! Kate is pregnant! [It's a...] A? Zombie?! Oh, no way. That cake was so good, though. [I used the wrong food coloring.] Leeenchik. Oh, my god. [I'm sorry.] Lenchik. That was actually the first time I was pregnant. In the, in that frame. Beautiful pregnant mom. Katushka. Happy house. Aw, I love this shot. Aw, the baby bump. Everyone's wearing white. Ah! Alice! [Dangerous a virus with 126 new cases confirmed today] Ahh! Again?! Miss Debbie! Perfect. [WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE PART My favorite part was... I thought that was like super super super cool. And also when we all clapped at the end. So good. And I love Debbie's acting. Like, her acting is so good. Miss Debbie. Yeah, Miss Debbie. It's insane, yeah. Always on point. She put some spiciness. Yeah. Some little accent. It's so funny. Yes. A lot of my favorite parts were the shots of the zombies, and I think a lot of those shots are so beautiful, and the makeup, super believable, and the eyes, the way they glow. Like, I've never seen zombies look like that before. They're always, like, really crusty, and really, like, you know? Yeah. Teenage zombies. I think my favorite like not it's not actually a part, but I just love how it's the story is like really you're revealing through the whole episode. Like, you see the shots and then we see like this same shot but a little bit more when Chelsea was reading the diary. So it makes it really interesting, a movie like thing. Yeah, that's so true. Like they're all connected. I love the whole episode and Also like shout out to all the crew and everyone who put the team together like I feel like everything from like the set of the laboratory to the camera work to the music, direction, writing, everything was great. So like so many people made it happen So yeah, it's a great group. All right, guys thank you so much for watching this video and we'll see you next time. Bye!
