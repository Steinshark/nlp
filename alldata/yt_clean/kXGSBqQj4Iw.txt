No, for each of you. So I'm the youngest to oldest So. Fizz, fam. Every year we have a tradition of their Christmas presents early. So here are the presents. I've got four here. And I think, we should do it in age order. But also to make it even more fun, where you have to go and find it first in your bedroom and then you get to open it up. Let's get Koa to do it But first of all, just so you know what this one is Karma's. This blue one is Koa's And just because it's big it doesn't mean, it's a better present than the other. Okay. They're all very good and very equal, should I say? And then that one is for Mia, and then this one is for Sienna. Okay. Are you excited? So, yeah, I think age order is important because the younger they are, So we should let Koa. Koa. Koa, are you listening? Tricking you No, I don't. He's saying he knows what they are. He doesn't, he always says that Fizz Fam He actually doesn't know. Okay. Just letting you know that, Koa, you can go first. So I'm gonna go and hide your present in your bedroom, and then when you find it, bring it back here in front and then you can open up Yeah. Doesn't that sound fun? I think mine's gonna be a Barbie house Wait and see. Right. Fizz Fam I think mine.. she's laughing, it's right isn't it? No. No, it's not. I'm not saying anything. You could.
