- [Mark] This guy stole and he's about to open it in his house. - Hello. - What he doesn't know is that of a new and improved that's recording him on and just released a pound of along with some other nasty surprises. (pump squeaking) But to understand how we got here, we first have to go back in time a bit. (audio reversing) Because that's when this from my porch. And even with the video footage, the police wouldn't do anything. So I vowed to use my engineering skills to go full &quot;Home Alone&quot; on these punks, not just to avenge my package, but as a tribute to the that are stolen across America every year. And because packages are for the third year now, it's sort of become a for me to do my very small part to encourage future would be porch pirates to choose a different profession in just the most fabulous way possible. So before we see how this year's I'm gonna first walk you my buddy, Sean, and I into this box over the past year. For starters, we updated the outer casing. This time going for more You can sort of see the evolution from year to year right here. As part of this, we created in the hopes that the not realizing we took a page directly from the Kevin McAllister by putting extra sticky This is the exact same stuff And as you can see here, You'll also notice these Those are the most critical but more on that in a second. Under the hood, we made The fundamentals are still a battery powered on a custom printed circuit to these four phones, which no matter which side they open it from. But this time we upgraded to have its own SIM card too, so we can fully control all at any time, including to be played on command. And you'll see why that And this year you'll see not one, not two, but four canisters of fart spray. I had the personal goal who opened this box would at on just how bad it smells. Stayed with that, I'm using the same absolutely wretched formula that almost killed - (coughing) I can still smell it. (Macaulay coughing) - Along with just a touch or I'm going light on this stuff because it lingers much and anything more than a couple Woo. And so these cans are turned by motors which sprays the fart spray, and we keep spraying it every 30 seconds, because first of all, it's But second and more of the package out of their house before they realize This design feature makes our boxes 100% of the time from the closest trash can or dumpster, since we already know at all times due to the But if the box does get destroyed by a package-stealing glitter-hater, (bell dinging) all the phones will have to the cloud for me to And then of course, we've got the main attraction powered by a motor underneath here, which this year holds 15% more of the finest biodegradable And so then after opening the in a daze trying to process well that's when we start the countdown. - [Robotic Voice] Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. to the end. But having just been covered they're going to be terrified of what this would by the time the countdown ends. And then after the countdown, (walkie talkie squeaking) But this year we added LEDs, in red and blue lights for added ambiance. This also allows us to illuminate with white light, in case they And then finally, we've got this lid which still has these two so we can record what's going As you can see, Kevin's has also been working hard this year. He's releasing not just but the entire BuzzCollection. And it's just adorable when you hear some of these package thieves And this is literally the box we use, but somehow they never with lots of little words that would totally give And so now with the lid in place, you could see the function of because when the lid which prevents the natural who just quickly put the This happened quite a bit last year, and it just makes it way less fun for nearly everyone involved. And if you look at the CAD, you can see how these are designed such that once the plunger is extended out by this spring, this little drops down into the groove from being pushed back in. This is just a beautiful passive solution, and the only way to reset is to either wave a magnet here, which sucks that steel chunk up, thereby allowing the plunger to go back in or to turn the whole thing upside down which means the chunk due to gravity. And for the final major last year it was a hassle to have to bring the boxes in and then remember to put It was also a problem in the late afternoon, batteries could be So this year we made a custom doormat that discreetly plugs in, and then inductively charges So it's always ready to go. So the idea is after the bad and then comes sneaking by all the batteries are at and the box knows that So it texts us that it's been stolen, and starts recording and sending us GPS updates. So when they eventually get the circuit board brain knows it's go-time and autonomously sets - [Robotic Voice] Hello. (fan whirring) - Now, is it petty to dedicate to completely over-engineering a box just to shoot a little glitter at someone? Yes. But at the same time, could just ridiculous and beautiful? Also yes. (majestic music) So that's glitter Bomb 3.0, and you wanna support you can get this super dope hoodie of the wire frame CAD After 10 years of YouTubing, I finally got some merch And I can assure you that the by using the second rate into making everything and comfortable and to give free returns. And so now all that was left to porches all across America. And thanks to my friends at with a bunch of cameras, we could monitor everything And we didn't have to wait long. (suspenseful music) Our very first box was taken at night. (metal clashing) - [Robotic Voice] Hello. (box tumbling) - [Movie Gangster] Keep the - [Mark] And apparently they the name calling or the (box falling) because in the morning So it was one box down, but (test pattern beeping) - [Movie Gangster] Say hello, (fan whirring) to my little friend. (pump squeaking) (box hitting microphone) (pump squeaking) - [Robotic Voice] 15, 14, 13, 12, 11. ten, nine, eight, seven, six, - [Mark] And while he didn't - [Robotic Voice] Five, - [Mark] The countdown was (box hitting microphone) - [Movie Gangster] Say hello, (fan whirring) to my little friend. (pump squeaking) - [Box Thief] Darn (beep) bull (beep). (pump squeaking) - [Robotic Voice] Six, five, four, three, two, one. Activation complete. Recovery sequence initiated. - After a nice fart spray this lady tries to wrestle for a solid ten minutes our one Achilles' heel (pump squeaking) And she got it. I mean, I'm not even mad. That's just impressive. (test pattern beeping) (box scraping microphone) - [Macaulay] Hello. (fan whirring) You guys give up? Or are you thirsty for more? - [Box Thief] So bright. (Box Thief laughing) - [Mark] And at this point I'm like, how is nobody mentioning the smell? So you can imagine how - [Robotic Voice] Six, five, four, three, two. Recovery sequence initiated. (Box Thief chuckling) (pump squeaking) - [Macaulay] Hello. (fan whirring) You guys give up, or are you thirsty for more? (dog barking) (pump squeaking) - [Box Thief] Ew, I smell it. - [Mark] This one was another (pump squeaking) (test pattern beeping) - [Box Thief] It looks like earplugs. - [Box Thief's Partner] Yeah, (hand hitting microphone) It's all yours now, baby. (box scraping microphone) - [Macaulay] Hello. (fan whirring) - [Movie Gangster] Keep the (pump squeaking) (pump squeaking) - [Robotic Voice] 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Activation complete. Recovery sequence. (static buzzing) - [Mark] And this one was the perfect Harry and Marv Wet Bandit reaction, because not only did his but he got doused with the fart spray and then freaked out with the by the mouse-glue handle (police scanner crackling) - Yes. (test pattern beeping) - These guys had suspicions, so they took it outside to open it. - [Macaulay] Hello. (fan whirring) - [Box Thief] What the? (engine whirring) - [Macaulay] You guys give up, - [Box Thief] (laughing) Wait, hold on. (pump squeaking) (box thief laughing) (laughing) I'm sorry. Hold on, we just opened (Box Thief laughing) glitter and fart spray. - [Box Thief's Partner] I told you. (Box Thief laughing) Get the (beep) away from it. - [Box Thief] I was so (beep). (Box Thief laughing) (pump squeaking) - [Box Thief's Partner] Ugh. - [Voice On Scanner] 10-4, (test pattern beeping) - Because I don't want anyone about humanity after that make it into my video. Just like last year, we the good apples too. So in some cases we left and left tons of contact and 90% of the people did the and didn't take something Then an additional 7% took it, but they were really trying by locating where it was supposed to go, and then calling the all over the label. - [Voice On Phone] And they left them out by the group mailbox. - Really? - [Voice On Phone] Yeah, I'm just like, I do not wanna leave these there. - In those cases, we would and typically give them for being so cool. It's only that teensie in my video, and they almost never fit my preconceived notion of Like in this case, we had and then randomly a to arrest this guy who lived there. Then this teenage kid literally walking past in the process. - [Teen] We're gonna steal a - [Another Teen] Nobody saw you, dude. - [Teen] You promise? - [Another Teen] And they're to that. They've come to take You gotta get rid of this stuff. (tape tearing) I need to cut this up and get rid of it. Here, we're gonna actually - [Teen] So no one can find it? - [Another Teen] Yep. - [Teen] It feels good. - [Another Teen] What feels good? - [Teen] Stealing. - [Another Teen] Stop. Don't brag about it. Nothing. - [Teen] Okay. - [Another Teen] 'Cause you know the kid, he would've taken it. - [Teen] Any one of them would have. Could I have the buds? - [Another Teen] We'll talk. This is my Christmas present. (box scraping microphone) - [Movie Gangster] Merry Christmas, (fan whirring) - [Teen] Whoa. - [Movie Gangster] Ya filthy animal. (pump squeaking) - [Teen] Ew, fart spray. - [Another Teen] Go get a garbage bag. (pump squeaking) - [Robotic Voice] 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, ten, nine. (garbage bag crinkling) - [Voice On Scanner] 10-4, I've got a read on the location. - [Another Teen] Well, it was a joke. It was a glitter bomb. - [Teen] So we won't get (scanner screeching) - I'm hopeful the fart spray changed his thoughts on stealing. And as we were in the process of putting all these boxes out, with all those prerecorded scam calls. So I thought, how amazing would it be if I could send a glitter So I called up my buddy, Jim Browning, who has a YouTube channel the remote connection in this case getting access then disrupting the scam and/or their bank. And so by teaming up, we were two packages that were moments to scammers, and then swap - [Delivery Person] Have a good holiday. - And these packages contained that we were able to return to but then very grateful owners. And it's such a crazy, convoluted story that involves multiple the NYPD. - [Scammer] It's a glitter bomb. It has a camera built into it. There's a camera built into this. - But the problem is, it's and all sorts of interesting So we're still chasing down leads, and basically glitter bombing our way through the whole chain of command. And don't worry, we're being cautious, and we're appropriately At any rate, I was planning in this video, but the such a hard right and is still ongoing that I won't be ready for another couple months. And by the way, if you're thinking, &quot;How dumb could someone be? I would never send $15,000 Just hold your judgment 'til The scammers tactics just an email from a Nigerian prince. So make sure you're and Jim's channel if you want to hear how this whole thing pans out. Another new thing we tried this year, was because I live near San Francisco and cars get broken into I was curious what would happen And the window was busted We actually had a camera placed in the car and one across the street, but apparently Murphy's law was in full force that day 'cause the one in the car and stopped recording. And then I'm sure the world's nicest, but unfortunately also got picked up at precisely The whole thing took for them to smash the and just be gone. (box scraping microphone) - [Box Thief] I don't know what this is. Brand new though. - [Mark] My buddies in the in case they were just until we heard this. - [Box Thief] They're following us. - [Box Thief's Partner] That's why we left, clown. - [Box Thief] That's 'cause the PD was coming. - [Box Thief's Partner] I got driving around the city. - [Mark] At that point and just watch the GPS as they drove all around the city streets for about two hours. And look, besides my any other accusations about them. I mean, maybe they're who love to cruise around and admire all sorts of different cars. - [Box Thief's Partner] a four-door behind us. - [Box Thief] I see a - [Box Thief's Partner] - [Box Thief] Stop, get 'em. - [Mark] But there's that also fits the GPS evidence. - [Box Thief] I really - They're just trying to find a bathroom. - [Box Thief's Partner] There's a restroom at Shell? (comical music) They don't got a bathroom there. (comical music) Is the restroom there? - [Box Thief] COVID, man, (comical music) - [Box Thief's Partner] There's You better go do the squat up - Either way, the batteries So we decided to go with Hey guys, it's me, the headphones box. Of uploading a custom sound to the phone to see how they would react. So we don't want any trouble. So you can go ahead and open me, and you can have everything inside. We'll call it even. Now, I can take that audio message, and text it to the box. And then I could listen, near real time, as the clips were uploaded to the server. You can go ahead and open me, and you can have everything inside. We'll call it even. - [Box Thief] I could bang it, I could bang- (alarm blaring) (gunshots popping) (static buzzing) (alarm blaring) - Probably not gonna go And so while I'm left contemplating exactly what just happened, I'll leave you with my favorite (test pattern beeping) - [Box Thief] I picked it up. It's (beep) brand new. Buzz boss, BuzzBuds in - [Box Thief's Partner] Can I open it? - [Box Thief] Yeah. (Box Thief's partner laughing) (box scraping microphone) - [Macaulay] Hello. (fan whirring) - [Movie Gangster] Keep the - Oh, it's one of those- (pump squeaking) (Box Thief's partner laughing) It's one of those trick boxes. - So somebody (beep). - What came out of it? Glitter? - [Box Thief's Partner] Yeah. - Oh my God. What the (beep)? (Box Thief laughing) It was one those (beep). (pump squeaking) - [Robotic Voice] 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, ten, nine, eight. Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Activation complete. (pump squeaking) Recovery sequence initiated. - [Box Thief] I don't know Oh, God. Disgusting. What kind of mother (pump squeaking) (metal crashing) - If you look in our freezer, Well, kind of. You'll have to first open I camouflage it in. But inside that bag, you'll I designed. Now you might be thinking, But let me explain why the Because I can put my ice cream in here, and the lid just barely But then when you let for a bit and take it out, the lid is clamped onto the thereby protecting you from anyone else in my house who won't realize the trick is just to run over the lid for about 30 seconds. And the reason this works from steel and the lid And aluminum shrinks and grows more when it warms up. This idea just occurred to And that's the thing I love If you have an idea about a thing and that thing doesn't exist, you can just will it into existence. So here's my big announcement. I've been secretly on a month-long creative that will teach you how to to bring your own creative ideas to life. In this class, I cover my full from how I come up with to finalizing the build I talk through everything everything that I'm doing, Over the course of a month, and create three totally original builds, but more importantly, I will guide you through finishing three And this is an online from anywhere and work but it's fully immersive and intensive. So whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced engineer, this course has been designed to meet you where you're at, and then And the engineering is the exact same one I and for all of my videos.
