Welcome to Sad Boyz, a podcast I'm Jarvis. This is - You can just - you're in the shot. - All right? - Huh? - Yeah, there's a - come on. - I just went ahead. - Sound speed? Get the mics on? Jacob did the clapper. You can sit down now. Uh, and I'm Jordan. - Uh... Did I even say who I was? 'Cause maybe I could be anyone. - It's not the time to be Willy Wonka. You know what I did last night? On your recommendation. I saw Madame Web. I... have never... laughed so much in a movie Comedy's legal again, folks. - Hollyweird is back. what I was seeing on the screen. We are both, I think, casual enjoyers - of crap movies, as anyone can be. But I think everybody has Some people like old B movies made Some people like kinda medium-budget... or something like The Room, where the absurdity's in what's the story. I really do love watching Sony burn cash and produce an embarrassing product. It was crazy, 'cause, um... I wanted to go to the movie theater and see pretty images and - That was the mood that I was in. - Mmhmm. And this delivered in so many more ways than just that. Um... Yeah, it's like going to McDonald's It's like going to McDonald's Yeah, dinner and a show. And it's the funniest movie And I got a little popcorn. I used my AMC A-List, not sponsored. Um, we all, uh... We all recited the Nicole Kidman speech. - What accent does she have? - OK. - not been there for so long. [ANASTASIA] It's subtle now, I feel like. Yeah, she was charging it up. - She's kind of got a - - It's like the equivalent of - Well, it's kinda like Also, yeah, 'cause when she came... Like, when she joined Hollywood... I'm sure it wasn't... I'm sure she had to, like, whatever, you know, was the norm. [ANASTASIA] If you see her, um, early Australian films, she has a thick Australian accent. [ANASTASIA] Her hair - like she has red hair. Um... (Australian accent) I bloody - Pictures are big... The sands - what's that one line? The, um, &quot;Heartbreak feels nice.&quot; (laughing) &quot;Heartbreak - Not too bad when you're in a movie! - because they are. Here. - It was too big. or you can get out back. The movie'll find you no matter what. - You'll hear it. Yeah. Do you love AMC? Me too. Too loud. - Too loud. you think it was worth the price. Oh, OK. Well, yeah, one - the... The script of Madame Web is hilarious. But one quick... It's weird to see a terrible script Was your mix also awful? OK, my mix I don't think was - I didn't notice the mix. But I did notice random bouts of ADR. - Oh, yeah. And important. The villain... does not have - literally does not have It was so... unnerving. But the first notice of ADR I got And we're gonna spoil the hell out of - I have to talk about this. - Please. they're in Peru in, like, the forest? - Anastasia saw the movie as well. - They're in the Amazon. In the forest/jungle/spider-hunt zone. Right, where the spiders are. With some kind of nonspecific militia. There's just two guys from the militia, - Um, but the... The first thing was - Madame Web's mom is pregnant. - [ANASTASIA] Mama Web. Very pregnant. She's like, uh... - like, days away from delivery. One of two characters in the movie... so pregnant it's almost scary. And, uh, and... she... Like, she has a kick, like the baby kicks, and she goes, &quot;Ow!&quot; - But it does not come out of her mouth. - It is... I don't know. I just feel like - Yeah, I just don't know what happened. - She goes, &quot;Yay! I'm being kicked!&quot; they weren't filming in a real jungle. - the Universal backlot or something. [ANASTASIA] So why Sorry; I'm thinking about... the representation And, uh, how there's... How, um, the forest right outside of looks identical to the Amazon. Oh, yeah, dude. She's in the forest, and it's almost suggested - that she drives a taxi to Peru. Uh, but also just is on a biplane, Somehow! I don't know where she got that. Um, another - we're jumping around, Another great moment in the movie she doesn't wanna get hunt down And in order to hide from the evil pursuer, Ezekiel Sims, who was with her mother - studying spiders - Oh, by the way, Not in the movie! (laughing) It's not fuckin' in it, for some reason! Uh, but anyway, yeah, she's like, &quot;I need to make sure in a taxi she stole. - So she takes off the license plates. - The end. She doesn't put new ones on. She takes off the license plate, leaves - It almost looks like she leaves - And - It was a taxi that (laughing) Where they're talking about it on the news - on the radio that she's listening to. She's an EMT driver who I guess doesn't have a car. - Has a $3 million New York apartment. It is - the movie does take place - Um, and - I guess just - 'cause Sony, it's not It was gonna be the Andrew Garfield The Sony Pictures Universe of Movies, But... there's really not much I even heard that, like... The ending song is from [ANASTASIA] Yeah, the music - look. [ANASTASIA] They didn't put - [ANASTASIA] if the music fit the era. - The big Beyonce installment. Oh, and &quot;Toxic&quot; by Britney Spears? &quot;Tell me you don't love this song.&quot; - (Anastasia cackling) - We are jumping around too much. as we all know, is that if you drive to it - (Jarvis laughing) which you now know the location of later. Why did they take her - I literally was talking to my friend... Oh, god! OK, we have to go chronologically, - 'cause this is - I'm jumping around. Can I go back to the fact that was .5 miles away from the forest - - They are so specific about distance. to drive that .5 miles. (laughing) Yeah, in the sequence she who, by the way, if you When I saw the initial trailer, you that these are her friends It's her and Sydney Sweeney and two others, and they're dressed in spider costumes. - They're teaming up. Avengers! I assumed, seeing the trailer, She gets the Madame Web powers, and they become a team. Sydney Sweeney, who is eight years younger than Dakota (mumbling)-manota - Wait, how old is Dakota Johnson? - Uh, 34. No, 36. Sydney Sweeney's 28. Sydney Sweeney's 26. Oh, OK, yeah. Dakota Johnson - They're closer in age than... - Like, Sydney Sweeney - I believe, because of Euphoria, that Sydney Sweeney But they almost worked to make it - feel like an adult playing a teen - in the wardrobe and stuff. [JORDAN] They dress her But yeah, she's like, And they... but no, she's supposed to be like a wizened elder. Who is... she's presented Rachel is in the first season of Friends. &quot;I'm just trying to get my life together. Yeah, she's in her early 30s, they say. But she's 30 years old in the movie, 'cause they go 1973, 2003, right? Like, she's barely 30 in the story. [ANASTASIA] So, the ADR thing - Sorry. a dialogue-free moment in the film. - It's relentless. to the point where she's alone and she talks to a cat. That was wild. Are you referring to the scene where, in order to illuminate By the way, the pacing Even thinking about it now, because half the movie is her Sequence after sequence of, &quot;I think I can see the future!&quot; - Literally! - They do it... they overdo it so much. The fact that when she was at and she's having the... she's already had instances of her flashing forward to the future, but still treats it like... to everyone else like she... She's like, &quot;We just did this.&quot; Not &quot;I'm weird and Obviously, it's a &quot;New York's crazy these days.&quot; That's in my Notes app! - (Jarvis laughing) The editing is crazy! There is a point where she and a guy goes, &quot;New York's It is - and then It's one of the - It truly feels like a &quot;Hey, do you know where my train is going?&quot; (both laughing hysterically) Wait! Do you remember her reply?! - She says, &quot;I hope not!&quot; &quot;Is this the train to Yuker?&quot; &quot;I hope&quot; - 'Cause she's going to Poughkeepsie, - What is it? Yeah, &quot;Is this a train to...&quot; Oh, fuck. It's, uh... uh... Peru. (laughs) &quot;Is this the train that goes to Peru?&quot; [ANASTASIA] One of the craziest things... that I didn't realize - is that it is a prequel - to a movie that hasn't happened yet. [ANASTASIA] They're like, We're gonna do a movie after this.&quot; So... Well, Kraven the Hunter, of course. Coming out soon. - [ANASTASIA] I didn't know that. - of a property no one's interested in. set all this stuff up... [ANASTASIA] It's a superhero - No superheroes. No powers. - Basically. OK, so for a little context Madame Web goes through a series when her mother was studying, uh, spiders in the jungle with Through a series of Cassie Spider-Man! Is, uh, prior to - Spider-Man existing in this world - - I'll pull up the quotes list as well. - What's his fucking name? Ezekiel Sims, where he goes, um... He goes, &quot;I don't care I wanna know about the girls.&quot; - &quot;Webb?!&quot; - Uh... Why wouldn't he care - shuttling these girls around? Anyway, because of this, she has access to almost a Groundhog-style Day She's flashing forward, getting killed or something but it's kind of an Sometimes it's a couple minutes, Imagine watching Groundhog Day... Or, maybe a better comparison, - imagine just watching Spider-Man. Spider-Man 1, Tobey Maguire... and the scene where he he looks at his hand and goes, &quot;Huh?&quot; and then there's a knock And he goes downstairs and 20 additional before he acknowledges anything And then there's another scene - he goes, &quot;Huh.&quot; Twenty minutes of the movie go by. It is... close to an hour... It's around the one-hour mark - [ANASTASIA] It's not that long. It doesn't feel, by the way, that any powers happen the only time you see vaguely when she's like, &quot;Actually, I shielded you, 'cause I knew that piece That's the thing. It never feels like... and interesting, like, Like, the fact that could basically be completely - Her power is doing perfect trick shots. It's like, &quot;I'm gonna drive&quot; - She fucking (laughs) We'll have to get the clip of this. And drives it off of - And then - Like, he's 30 feet lower. And then he jumps up - because she called her shot. She knew... She conditioned him. Yeah, he's downloaded. [ANASTASIA] I was hooting and hollering when the ambulance came out of the, like, - second or third floor, because all you see is close-ups of her driving. [ANASTASIA] You have - The geography of this whole movie. Because she had the taxi It is... you know, something, My friend leaned over to me at one point, 'cause the whole night we were just She'd say, &quot;Let me get some coffee;&quot; Just doing that back and forth all night. And then... he pointed out, like, &quot;This should be Madame Car.&quot; She's just... stealing - There's four different times [ANASTASIA] She's very good at driving. - She's really good at driving. she's driving an ambulance. You sent me the, um... You sent me the poster where it says &quot;Madame Web and Mr. Jump.&quot; (laughing) - Oh, wait. I have a question for Jacob. Jacob, you can show this picture, - where I'm in my car and I'm just crying. After watching the movie, I'm just fucking crying because - [JORDAN] Dude, we - If you type in &quot;Madame Web - there's a four-minute scene. This will... this will look like, um, if a TikTok summary of a movie comes up and they move around the order - that's what half the movie feels like. And not just - not in a - though that's also incomprehensible. This is the one-minute version. [ANASTASIA] This was the longest... four minutes of my life. In fact, it might be revealed here. Uh, Jacob, let me ask you a question, - Um, would you like to take - Take a stab at, 'cause I believe um, what nickname is established by the cast and carried for Here are your four options. This man has Spider-Man powers, he's not strong, And we never name him the entire movie. - Ceiling Guy. Crawl Man. Freaky Dude. Or Mr. Web. [JACOB] I guess B, Crawl Man. - Ceiling Guy! For most of the movie, Honorable mention goes to - &quot;He's some kind of spider-person?&quot; I - it is - The restraint they have on some stuff, and then the other ones, like... to the point where I thought &quot;I was just thinking about how, like, you should probably have The famous Uncle Ben line with - It is Uncle Ben, right? &quot;With great power comes Played in this movie - Adam Scott's great. [ANASTASIA] I was constantly [ANASTASIA] I was like, Yeah. Uh, yeah. Why is Mike Epps in this movie? - But it's cool! I mean - - by their agents telling them it's Marvel. But I don't - These are all extremely talented actors. They've just been done - it's almost like - I almost feel like they're that I shouldn't see, or they're cut in ways that because they make the acting... It's almost like when someone holds a line and then holds frame to, like, make sure that you get the whole shot, and then in editing you Some... There's, um, wrap-ups on these, where clearly they're waiting for cut. That's the professional thing to do. You've done your line. The end of every single rush there is always a long period where they just have to Like that bit in Samurai Cop, &quot;Ha!&quot; &quot;Those ki&quot; - 'cause it's just not cutting. - There is a fucking - &quot;He's ruining the hamburger patties.&quot; &quot;You're talking about how - by pressing them down?&quot; &quot;All the fat's coming out of the patty, - (laughing) - That's real dialogue! Which goes nowhere, by the way. Which, I know we're leaping around - &quot;Leaping around.&quot; Ha! Um, speaking of Adam Scott, there is a - this was my There is a reveal of, uh, Emma... - Roberts? Emma Roberts playing... Mary Parker? - Whatever Peter Parker's mother's name. And this is all very casually acknowledged. But yeah, Uncle Ben is there. There's even a throwaway line &quot;Ben's really looking forward [JARVIS] Yeah. [ANASTASIA] They will never say... - you know, everything in order. Let me know if this is gonna steal During the baby shower... - Yes. During - - Something she says that is... - Let's hear it. It's also relatively early in the movie, but I did not expect hits like this. At the bridal shower for after receiving a kick she says... She might as well She chuckles and says to her friends, &quot;He won't stop swinging around in there.&quot; - Ohhh. Oh. I didn't catch that one. - (Anastasia laughing) Yeah, he won't stop He won't stop fighting &quot;What's the baby's name?&quot; &quot;Richard?&quot; &quot;We're not What a insane game. Uh, oh, insane moment, insane moment #5,000 They're doing... They're doing a thing where everybody's written down... - [JORDAN] Oh, yeah! - relationship with their mother. - You know. You know at bridal showers, Yeah, of course. Yeah, and you go, the crust off my sandwiches.' - &quot;Yeah. That was me.&quot; &quot;OK, next one. Next one.&quot; &quot;This one's blank.&quot; &quot;Who the FUCK left a blank piece of paper in there?!&quot; And Dakota Johnson does her She goes, &quot;Uh, that was me.&quot; &quot;That was me.&quot; &quot;Why didn't you Or do nothing. - You can put nothing! Or if you see a blank slip, And she goes, &quot;Well, my mom's dead.&quot; - It is... It is a really strange - That's an element of her personality - is that she's just a weird person. She's perfectly socialized, She's a little kinda wry or whatever, a little off-putting, But she's, you know, She is, like, completely incapable half the time, when it serves the script, and then she's with Adam Scott, like, &quot;What's the deal with And then she goes on the train and is like, &quot;I, um, uh, one twain licket, please!&quot; Yeah, then she's like, And everybody's like, &quot;Uhh, oh no!&quot; Well, maybe you don't - when they don't answer [ANASTASIA] Maybe I rewrote this in &quot;SURELY you have ONE Yes! No, literally! they're leaning into it. They're like, &quot;Come on! Everyone has a mom!&quot; &quot;There's no one in the It's literally like if she was just like, &quot;What's everybody's And it's like, &quot;I don't know. &quot;Is she walking away? Then that same person is the one It's like that Key &amp; Peele sketch, like, &quot;Awkward!&quot; and it's like, Because then she goes, and then Mary, Mary Parker is like, &quot;Ohhhh. Ooh.&quot; - &quot;No, but childbirth is, uh&quot; - &quot;It's rare. And also, my mom, - she was in the Amazon,&quot; or whatever. studying some spiders She died in childbirth Yeah. OK, well - OK, there's two big issues Her motivation, her dark past, (laughing) is that her mum died, which she hates her mother for, because she was in Peru, [ANASTASIA] She was like, But we know why. Like, we don't know but we know - the first scene So we know that her hatred for so we have to spend the whole moth - The whole movie with this Well, I lied, because my favorite line Reading through her mum's during her research in the Amazon right That she doesn't look at her entire life at which point she reads it - Under her bed. so haphazardly. - [ANASTASIA] Doesn't spend much time. and it's all pictures of spiders, Oh, and also stills from the movie - which is hilarious. [ANASTASIA] Of Ezekiel Sims Yeah. Hey, guys, - You could just do another shot. It's like they realized way too late. It's almost like they greenscreened &quot;We've got too many spiders. why does a researcher have That's weird. But yeah, anyway, I was reading through this which is mostly drawings of spiders - and some math for some reason. - Spider equations. &quot;Did somebody say 'Webb'?&quot; Cassie solemnly says, &quot;Well, mum, I hope (Jarvis and Anastasia laughing) That's - that messed me up. I was, like, we were grabbing There were so many things that because it was the awkward silence And again, it's not the actors. Like... [ANASTASIA] It feels like a combination - of the heavily-used ADR. - Mmhmm. when you're recording ADR, And they're all for, like, - So the spacing sounds wrong. 'Cause they're not treating the audio to - All the ADR audio sounds like like it's in a booth, exploding in Times Square or it's her speaking to her cat, it sounds exactly the same. Ezekiel Sims, by the way, has an accent that I cannot place. Well, so supposedly and a lot of the shots just sneakily lead away from him because supposedly - Well, one of the claims his voice and his acting, it was hard to understand. His accent was too thick. But the voice they gave him - Did they give him a different voice? [ANASTASIA] Did someone else do it? - He's got this bizarre affect. I don't know if he's and that's why he was there. Oh, yeah! Because I - The whole movie, it opens up - Beginning scene, they're She's like, &quot;We're gonna find this spider.&quot; so that you know she's into - And then - - &quot;Yeah, it's ma-damn web.&quot; - [ANASTASIA] Good one. She's like, &quot;I got the spider,&quot; and then Ezekiel Sims - on everybody in the camp. Shoots one of the random dudes. I don't know who that guy was. - [JARVIS] He murders a man. - For some reason, that he also shoots. and then he, uh... She's like, &quot;Please don't shoot me,&quot; and she's like, &quot;Over my And also, it's like... you... - You're working together. Just take it. What's she gonna do, - and have you arrested? - &quot;No, what I'll do is kill her.&quot; Now's the time for my gun.&quot; You could just go, - [ANASTASIA] Yeah! - In a taxi? she's dying on the... - jungle floor. [ANASTASIA] And an White guys, to be clear. - They're white spider-people. - All, like, descend - With the costuming of, like, a Korean knockoff merchandise called, like, &quot;Spider-Time!&quot; - &quot;Mr. Spider!&quot; &quot;Oh, they wouldn't be able to make - so they have to make it with twigs.&quot; - red branches wrapped around them. probably just do is not - 'cause it doesn't exist. Is it not insensitive imbue this magical indigenous group - That was kinda weird to me. [ANASTASIA] Like, [ANASTASIA] Because there's a lot &quot;Uh, oh, he...&quot; he, uh... - is, like, indigenous South American, and has, like, powers that feel racist. I mean, that's the thing, and when you see him in a different But in that environment, he has to be - He's speaking, you know... ambigu - who knows if he is Peruvian. - I'd guess - I assume he's whatever because they're shooting in Chesapeake. They're shooting in, like, Staten Island. They're not gonna reach out for somebody This weird - the shaman but it is so, like, the whole movie has this weird... a very strange relationship where it doesn't seem - in its story and won't spend a lot of time or explaining why certain But it also is definitely not and having compelling action scenes. So it's all these scenes 'til you get to the thing you like. It feels like the lore scenes except when you get to the fight [ANASTASIA] Yeah. - is I wasn't bored. [ANASTASIA] I'm watching - and I'm captivated. I was captivated and timing and dialogue was so... - compellingly strange. - You went with Eddy, right? - 'Cause Morbius - Same, you know, SPUM universe issue, same &quot;not quite Spider-Man, Also a story about so he goes to a vague, uh, different country to get that gives him specific powers, Also, the disease that... that Madame Web has is just a real disease that people have. [ANASTASIA] OK, so at &quot;Oh, her mom actually loved her, because she found out with a chronic...&quot; - A physioneurological disease. [ANASTASIA] And so she was going to Peru to find this spider, because rumor has it - this spider can cure - - [ANASTASIA] The peptides. - They keep saying that. - Yeah. - if she was an explorer. [ANASTASIA] We don't know. - [ANASTASIA] That's what it felt like. So, uh... I thought that maybe the most realistic, best scene in the movie, from a isolated standpoint, was the scene between because the doctor is doing doctor things, where they're giving her a &quot;The best you can offer me is...&quot; - [JORDAN] I know where you're going. I can't remember, but basically &quot;You can't help me, but you're I wanna take control. I wanna take action.&quot; It's a very believable - uh, thing that probably happens - to countless women especially. Uh... The mother's performance is - for the scenes she has. That scene is very grounded. UNTIL Madame Web, Cassie, - is witnessing this. - (laughing) She astrally project - In a, like, it was almost like where, like, her face She goes, &quot;You did it!&quot; (cackling) - [ANASTASIA] &quot;I don't have&quot; - Dude, the thing - the one before, &quot;I'm afraid your daughter has this&quot; - - I forgot the condition - But, &quot;Has this condition.&quot; &quot;It is a physioneurological disorder.&quot; And then, in case you aren't Cassie then immediately says, &quot;But I don't have a - (Anastasia laughing) &quot;Wait, my mom wasn't just - [ANASTASIA] &quot;That didn't care about me?&quot; - &quot;For fun?&quot; her mom was so gung-ho about spiders, was so into spiders that - days-from-being-born daughter to a place where Do you guys think - 'cause I'm sure All these dogshit Sony projects are. Do you think Ezekiel Sims - 'Cause they never talk about her dad. - I don't know anything about the comic. - I think Ezekiel Sims is unrelated to - Also, Madame Web is like - from the alternate dimensions and shit. [ANASTASIA] Well, so the - OK... [ANASTASIA] So, Cassie Webb... - Oh, Webb! at the doctor's office, because she goes to Peru - to seek out, like, answers. [ANASTASIA] And the funny thing &quot;I'm gonna go to Peru.&quot; [ANASTASIA] She gets in and when she gets back from Peru she drives the cab home. - Did she leave it at the airport?! No one at, like - no one at JFK saw a license plate-less cab sat in the road and was like, The owner of that cab, - who was just helping a family get out of his cab when she he's out a cab. That is his livelihood! It's also, like, you didn't - It's a very strange choice, because - [ANASTASIA] I thought she to Peru for training! OK, we need to talk about the girls, [ANASTASIA] Oh, yeah, we haven't. because the funny thing is one of the girls going, &quot;You've gotta go to Peru, don't you?&quot; - (Anastasia &amp; Jordan laughing) That is not - that is a &quot;Mr. Wick, are you back in?&quot; - &quot;Yeah. I gotta go to Peru.&quot; Ezekiel Sims's entire - is just Spider-John Wick. [ANASTASIA] We haven't - the girl from Girls, who's his - - [ANASTASIA] Yeah. - It's Zosia or Zasia? I don't know how you say it, She's just there. They have a technology that, uh, Ezekiel Sims has gotten by sleeping with and killing NSA agents. - Because that's how that works. He doesn't do it at a hotel. [ANASTASIA] We don't know [ANASTASIA] She's just the girl who can hack into any camera in the city. - Any camera in the city. - Nothing. Never. Nothing else happens. She's not in the end of the movie. She's not. She has access to technology that did not exist, even with national intelligence, - We were tapping telephones in 2003! [ANASTASIA] She was smarter than him &quot;You don't wanna know about this woman who's with the three girls - and he's like, &quot;No, I don't.&quot; - &quot;Webb. Webb.&quot; - &quot;Did you say Spider-Man?!&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Did you say Madame Web?&quot; - I just - sorry - But just like, &quot;Sorry; how did this happen?&quot; kinda scenes, where it has to be a rewrite. It is a movie about someone... that can see into the future... astrally project; find things, people; discover a mystery; hunt things down. And Ezekiel Sims' powers, At one point, he does have - He was bitten by the same spider. But he uses a computer to hunt her down, - not spider brain. the spider powers.&quot; &quot;But you have gotten the power to see the&quot; - Remember when she &quot;Yeah, you&quot; - where Madame Web [ANASTASIA] Oh my god. Yeah, so she goes to Peru meets the indigenous spider-people. He goes, &quot;This is where you were born.&quot; - She meets Peruvian John Wick. - where she was born, and that's where she has Well, they literally plagia - owning company, but like, uh, - they plagiarized the Dr. Strange - - OK, yeah! literally palm-punches - the soul out of her. Then she goes into the water, that sort of type of scene, - It looks so bad. when she falls into Then it happens a second time in Peru, Which is, uh - and goes blind. (Anastasia laughing) - (all laughing) [ANASTASIA] When you see - The reveal is insane. And it's... It - I don't know who it's - I - There is something going on at, like, some point where there's almost a checklist of, &quot;Yeah, but people love Madame Web. We can't have her not be [ANASTASIA] Yeah, &quot;This is a They wanna see her iconic glasses and her iconic wheelchair.&quot; &quot;But they don't want being paralyzed and blinded and then her story's about her - overcoming that with powers.&quot; We already have Daredevil. People are tired of those things. - We need to see&quot; - Yeah. That's the whole thing. It's like, why not just have her character - be a Professor X-type? - Why isn't that the movie?! It's like if Spider-Man got bit at the end. [JARVIS] Yeah. It's like, &quot;Oh, I got these powers.&quot; Especially 'cause it just feels like... paying lip service that, &quot;Well, she has to, like... break her back and - Because then she's not Madame Web. [ANASTASIA] It feels like a prequel. if we were, like... [ANASTASIA] Oh, yeah, broke her back, and went blind, and then through those challenges realized she had powers or whatever, it's like, OK, that's kind of interesting. [ANASTASIA] Or just the first, um, Spider-Man with, uh... - Tobey Maguire. Andrew Garfield. - Tom Holland. - Me. [ANASTASIA] The first one with him, - Yeah. - [ANASTASIA] It's really fun to see. at least in the first couple movies - - &quot;Ah, I've gotta go home, where am I?&quot; They do a... - No Way Home. That's the one. It's awful naming. I fucking hate it. Uh, they do not say &quot;with great power - because, (A) it's hack. And (B), it's more provocative. If we had a 30-year, like, uh... cultural awareness, or - of Madame Web's famous wheelchair, then maybe you have to allude to that. But if, instead, we'd never and he - and during the whole movie, he doesn't have his costume Which also never happens. None of the girls who, in the trailer, No, we are just - OK, Who was in the jungle [ANASTASIA] Should we We should. But his whole - So, his whole thing is that and he was explaining this to the and then stole her NSA credentials, which implies that he then did to steal the technology out of the NSA. I know that sounds exciting. - We don't wanna watch that. you still do need the servers It's unclear... It's not sexy. Also, You know, Patriot Act, We did not have facial recognition. What would be helpful is, That'd really put him [ANASTASIA] Can I just briefly mention right after 9/11? [ANASTASIA] 9/11 is never mentioned. [ANASTASIA] They don't mind... - [ANASTASIA] There's no allusion - in that Madame Web drives There was a lot of domestic - and also, it takes place clearly spring/summer 2003. - The invasion of Iraq was March 2003. - It is really weird to set it then. drive your stolen cab straight to Peru, - and no one stops you. Yeah! And get on! And - Post-9/11, you drive a unmarked, and it's there when She just parked it in the fucking - &quot;I'm gonna get on a flight, - [ANASTASIA] Long-term? Oh, no big deal. I'll be here. No, you can't take a picture - as it does not exist.&quot; Ezekiel Sims has access to entire national grid of all cameras and all tracking and everything.&quot; - Which aren't connected, by the way. where there's no cameras or logs.&quot; - &quot;Where nobody writes anything down.&quot; - 'Cause she's not important. So, his motivation. So, we see every single night of him being killed - - Yeah, getting his fucking ass kicked. - the three, um - - The girlbosses. I do wanna pull up the actors' names. I know we keep saying Sydney Sweeney, And this is not a slight on the actors, but it is very Disney Channel-coded. The superhero scenes feel like Kick-Ass, where it's like a tongue-in-cheek This feels like a movie from 15 years ago. - [JARVIS] Yeah. uh, kind of... I don't wanna be that, like, guy, but kind of racist. Like, &quot;Here's the nice Catholic girl, and she's innocent and sweet, And then the Black girl, &quot;Kind of a bully and a bit aggressive, And then the Hispanic teenager, - is not being able to pay rent. - And the dad got deported! Come on. So, it's Isabela Merced, Sydney Um, yeah, not to mention - like, the... Mattie Franklin, is the edgy Black girl who's a skateboarder - and she flips you off. - And goes in front of traffic. - Yeah, mad Black girl, and then - - Yeah, she's very Scary Spice. It was 2003. And then the, uh... - Uh, the... The Latina girl, who... Her dad got deported. She needs to lie low, and she doesn't need anybody else, None of them have parents. That's a She wears a shirt the whole time that says &quot;I eat math for breakfast,&quot; She's a freaky genius girl a la Gabriella which is why it felt like a Disney Channel And then Sydney Sweeney is - You could just take your hair down. You know in the original draft of this, - and she danced for the jocks or whatever. But instead they, like, and tie it in a cute way It is odd to have her being, like... The movie doesn't know to an implied 16-year-old or to treat her like - Like the nationally-recognized - top-five sex symbols in media. It's... And also, she is - I don't know about pretty significantly older - [JARVIS] Yeah. - she's taller and - or like a - I don't wanna place It feels like something just didn't match - [JORDAN] Just bad direction, yeah. is a believable high-school person You know, say what you will she at least feels like a whereas this, it's like I guess she doesn't get - other than being a goody two-shoes. [ANASTASIA] None of the characters are - They can only be 2D. &quot;No high-fives. That's lame.&quot; Literally, if the movie you could really make the argument Sure, she has the most screen time, but her background is The big &quot;they all connect&quot; scene, Learning CPR? [ANASTASIA] Learning CPR and what's funny is, legally, films can't actually show you because you can be like, &quot;Oh, I did what Madame Web told me to do and I killed this guy.&quot; - I feel like they did that, though. - [ANASTASIA] It's even worse! [ANASTASIA] It's even worse, because [ANASTASIA] So now you're like, &quot;Oh, With my friends. We switch off. - Oh, dude. That's what makes it feel - but it feels like a COVID movie You can imagine what the The big connecting moment for them, It's not even going on an adventure. Then the girls just arbitrarily There's no arc. And then they just start practicing CPR... Very roughly. They're really shoving And it's doing this, like... adorable panning 360deg of the group. All going, like, like they're doing But for CPR. And the thing they say, &quot;I'm getting tired.&quot; &quot;Oh, you should switch out.&quot; - And they do it three times. And then it comes back - &quot;I guess we were a team the whole time.&quot; No. - You aren't, though. [ANASTASIA] I like when she's like, &quot;Well, I gotta and the turning point where - [ANASTASIA] They hate her up until &quot;We don't have parents. - and she's like, &quot;OK.&quot; &quot;My parents hate me.&quot; &quot;Oh, shit. Like, OK. What do we do now?&quot; - &quot;I'm gonna fuck off to Peru.&quot; - &quot;Ah, my backstory hurts!&quot; You guys just hang out in the hotel - [ANASTASIA] They went to Ben's house. [ANASTASIA] And they became The thing is, though, as we know, um, you can't leave 17-year-olds So when these 17-year-olds that when a woman goes into labor, and drive to the hospital, make sure you're all together. - Can't do that. Gotta make sure... Uh, gotta make sure they're all seen. Yeah, take your glasses off. In the storyline, um... Madame Web sees these girls get... abducted. Or, excuse me. So, after the scene... Madame Web sees these girls... sees these girls getting killed. - She needs to save them. Pretty brutally. And there's a neurotoxin that comes out of Ezekiel Sims's hand. Uh... Then, after this, she steals the taxi; drives them away. where she leaves them for hours. The taxi is more of a character - The taxi is really developed. - One of the most developed characters. Um, so... So then, uh... I need to give this background, so that I can say Um, so then she goes to the forest, uh, leaves them in the forest. She goes back home I don't know why she had to But then she leaves them for too long. These three girls are alone. They know that .5 miles so they go to the diner to eat. We find out, um, one of the characters, Mattie, has a lot of money, but they're neglectful or whatever. So she's like the rebel child. And then... Uh... Right before Madame Web comes back, the inciting event for the conflict that occurs at the, uh, at the diner, is a man... looks at a newspaper that he is holding. They were abducted today. He already has a newspaper in his hand that has their faces on it. It has been six hours How did they print and Dude, by the way, this diner, lest you forget, - [JARVIS] Yeah. [ANASTASIA] There's a little paperboy, - &quot;I'm so tired!&quot; &quot;Extra, late edition of the paper! - &quot;I'm one o' them! I'm lost in the woods!&quot; available right here, for you!&quot; &quot;There's three women! Maybe - &quot;Are we in Peru?&quot; and I think they'll be here later.&quot; - Did somebody say &quot;Madame Web&quot;? - OK, we can watch this now. Such Disney Channel outfits. God, every shot's so much longer - [CASSIE] Get - get up. [ANASTASIA] So, that, just to explain, that happens like 10 times, where she sees a girl being attacked and then a guy sits next to her and she sees another girl being attacked, Every time she has one of these visions, - It's astounding. That's weird.&quot; - And it was tense, because - &quot;Haven't we already done it?!&quot; - Like, bitch, what is going on? [ANASTASIA] This is not the first time this three visions deep, you know? There are five set pieces This is the first time and she still doesn't understand it The first time it ever comes up is just boring, banal, Oh, no, she almost dies at work and it activates the latent That one happens, but the It just coincidentally happens. Next scene, she goes to the and that's kind of happening. Follow-up, there is a fire at a fireworks - like, a comically explosive factory - that the final set piece also happens. Like, a fire at the - You know? - It's like a joke. - It's like a joke. - Pepsi's a giant sponsor of this film. But remember the big sequence &quot;Hey, we gotta make sure because the building's structurally And then they go back to and they have not removed They just put the fire out. Instead, they have in a bunch of explosive crates, so that they can explode the fireworks. But, because Madame Web - I guess it's OK. Yeah, she does seem to operate &quot;Well, I'll see it if I die.&quot; Yeah. &quot;Oh, can't go that way. Also, there's two different instances of somebody just... being killed - that she has a premonition of and doesn't do anything about. - There's her friend - Can I, uh, drive the ambulance?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;OK.&quot; Boom, gets hit by a car. - Yeah, comically slow truck. because I thought it was gonna be I thought it was gonna happen than right after he pulls into She goes, &quot;No, Mike Epps!&quot; and he's like, &quot;I gotta drive the thing! I'm Mike Epps! - and then he goes - &quot;Oh, no!&quot; Yeah. Like, - while we're still sitting there with her. Like, it is just nothing. She doesn't use that or even try. And then... when she knows she has She cared more about saving these girls than her friend and But when she calls to get - like, preemptively, Madam Web-ily - &quot;Use the web!&quot; She calls the cops to send a helicopter The... the fireworks that she sets... flies into one of them not just the tail of the helicopter, - you can say, &quot;The pilot got out.&quot; The whole thing! Fucking obliterates! The front windows, there is Does she use that premonition? - No, she lets him die! than the lives of the Um, there is a funny moment about that, where the helicopter rescue I think - I could be wrong here - would never happen in &quot;We can't reach you from there. - Why would you - what do you mean? Like, you're telling these people to climb something? - Like, it's not meant for climbing. - over to the helicopter.&quot; tell you my favorite scene? - Please. they're on the Pepsi logo, - they're at the fireworks factory - They really are. It's not a joke. They are physically on the Pepsi logo, and the S from the Pepsi feature prominently early in the movie - and late in the movie. - [ANASTASIA] They're on - where they drink a Pepsi, the freshest, bluest looking can [ANASTASIA] She's tapping - She's like, &quot;I sure do love Pepsi!&quot; but a little bit less [ANASTASIA] So it's the big final battle. [ANASTASIA] And she has finally realized, she can be in multiple places at once. [ANASTASIA] And because they cannot have and they were really... banging them out in the ADR booth, she's like... - [ANASTASIA] She's just like Jesus, and all of her different selves and she goes, &quot;Here, take my hand. - Come on, let me help you.&quot; - [ANASTASIA] &quot;Get up now!&quot; [ANASTASIA] She's saying [ANASTASIA] Just show us. The music also is, like, The triumph music is at full blast, so it's buried in the mix. It's like, (singing triumphantly) [JARVIS] Yeah. The funny thing about that scene - everyone laughed at this - uh... What's, um... What are their names again? It's, uh... Isabel... Oh, yeah, hold on. Let's see. Oh, [Isabela] Merced's character. Uh, [Isabela], Sydney, and Celeste. Um, or Anya. Anya is her name. And Sydney Sweeney's Not Cassie, which is confusing. Yeah, that is confusing. So, she's like, um... She's like, &quot;Julia, do this!&quot; Um... &quot;Anya! Do this!&quot; And then she goes, &quot;Mattie! Hold on!&quot; (laughing) Like, she doesn't do any - She goes to Mattie and just - She doesn't tell her to do anything. We - I - we really The peak of her powers... it's not her astral projecting and then using, like, telekinesis It's - her power gives her It's anxiety. Her power is, like, - &quot;I think something bad's gonna happen.&quot; just is like, if Adam Scott - Yeah. she has the exact same thing And they're like, &quot;Oh, hey. Um... &quot;Let me give you a hand.&quot; That's it! And it is not like a cool, like, she floats down and gives them a hand. She's clumsily like, &quot;Oh, fuck, let me - I really didn't believe that, uh, her and Adam Scott, during their, um - They're partners, paramedic partners, and, uh, they're eating Chinese food, and Adam Scott's talking about - [JORDAN] Oh, weird. &quot;Is he telling her that - [ANASTASIA] Like, what's the deal? It's weird, because... their relationship isn't such that and it's gotten serious, - [ANASTASIA] They're together every day. And they go, &quot;What's this one's name?&quot; Is what Cassie says. No, she says it like, (flatly) &quot;What's this one's name?&quot; - [JORDAN] 'Cause she's asleep. It's so weird, 'cause it's like, I... I have to assume this was I don't think it's her fault, but - I don't know if I'd use the word &quot;fault.&quot; She didn't give a shit on the press tour. [JARVIS] Yeah. Um, but then, um... And then Ben Parker just goes... Just says nothing. And she goes, &quot;Oh, it's serious.&quot; &quot;Oh, it's serious.&quot; [ANASTASIA] &quot;'Cause you - Which... again - you're like, 'No. This one's for real.'&quot; We can - it's just - I can - Using the web, I can see what this movie was, several different - I can astral project myself Absolutely, there was a version of this, and this really shows when she &quot;I need your help. I need you to do...&quot; That scene especially, clearly, that's supposed to be a relationship 'cause he could've just been a friend, And then, clearly, it was supposed to be a, &quot;Well, now that I'm omnipotent I have to let that go. I can no longer be friends&quot; - [ANASTASIA] How's your vision? - CRAZY! - Crazy line. They walk into a clocktower apartment, She breaks her back and eyes. - She is permanently wheelchair-bound and blinded. And the girls come to visit her - [ANASTASIA] Like, &quot;Still not there!&quot; She's like, &quot;I can see now, Using the web, I can&quot; - &quot;I can see now, better than &quot;Uh, bless you, by the way. Exhausting to live with her. - [ANASTASIA] I would hate that. finish your shit, did you?&quot; - &quot;You forgot to flush.&quot; &quot;I know you have powers. [ANASTASIA] But I just wanna conclude - Adored it. Every second. A 10. of me crying, 'cause it is - Actually, can we watch more of The one thing I wanna try to illustrate, and obviously they're not gonna show is the sheer awkwardness. Adam Scott, I think, 'cause somehow all of [ANASTASIA] He plays an awkward character including this film. - [ANASTASIA] So - [ANASTASIA] I almost feel - [ANASTASIA] He's a fun guy to watch. - I think I'm a Adam Scott stan. [ANASTASIA] I'm actually even though I don't like Did you see the Suspiria remake? - [ANASTASIA] What? - [ANASTASIA] No. [ANASTASIA] Really? Oh, the... the, um... [ANASTASIA] The - OK, - Olivia? where she goes to the beach? - Oh, Beach Olivia. [ANASTASIA] Anyway, - Broadchurch. [ANASTASIA] I just like her I wanna see at least one of her, uh, phoned-in press tour things, - [ANASTASIA] What? - [ANASTASIA] No. I was watching the Shane Gillis - 'cause, you know, the whole thing. I saw a couple of her SNL sketches from she hosted like Great in those. Did a really good, uh... Are they called &quot;Weak and Destroy&quot;? Oh, Please Don't Destroy. She does a great sketch where they very openly acknowledge that three of the four of them - That's funny. &quot;A foot in the door, and so much more.&quot; - [ANASTASIA] I love that. - Is Dakota Johnson a nepo baby? - and her dad is Don Johnson. - [ANASTASIA] '80s stars. The thing you can pretty much - it's just the core competency Like, you know, no matter the movie, the script, the director, these movies are hiring guild craftspeople. These aren't just workmen. These are people that've been doing for 40 years, you know? Lighting should always be competent. There should never be a boom in frame. And one of the things there There's two scenes that, for some where there's weird I'm like, &quot;Was this shot in a different You're right that there's a core competency that comes with actual Marvel movies, where they feel like they and they're always quippy and funny and they've got something going. - And then it's like mid to good, you know? But these Sony, like... (laughing) inspired by, based on the novel Marvel like, Marvel movies - The Sony Pictures Yeah, it just - They just don't have the cogs or whatever that kind of lift up the movie, and it just ends up - It's uncanny. They've made just - the calculus is broken, where they've said, 10 traits, of those other They're transferable. It's like if I make a and I go, &quot;OK, people really liked that, so for dinner I'm going to - some sauce, and a plate crushed up. And I think what I'll do and that will sit in the chair and No, you - no, you took and put them in But you liked every single piece of those. You don't want a plate? I do want a plate, but you broke the plate - and put it in the food. you really liked the turkey, No, but I want it to eat. You always said how much so here's his friend. (laughing) Here's an old woman. - I take it back. - (laughing) But I cannot stress enough how much Well, I enjoy what this was but I don't think that... I think if you're gonna do Madame Web, the woman in the wheelchair [ANASTASIA] Or do this story, but stylistically make it like a drama. [ANASTASIA] Don't make it Yeah, 'cause it's not a character story. That's one of the pieces incorrectly taken, is, &quot;Well, people like fan-service.&quot; &quot;No, but they specifically like fan-service - Mmhmm. and we'll make references. Like, I like comics. I have And they're like, &quot;Oh, hey, was that... Anybody catch, uh, I mean, by costume, I guess, but we don't - We don't know why they get power - like - - [JORDAN] It doesn't even happen. because one day And we do not see them develop even a modicum of power [ANASTASIA] That's why I thought so they could get powers and get trained, and become what we know But maybe they don't become - Maybe they get their powers from that spider that's in Ezekiel Sims' house. - Oh, that's true. It's still there. What's it called? Not an aquarium, but a... - [ANASTASIA] Terrarium? so he can ominously have it - and then go back in the cage. I think I understood that him with his spider powers meant that he didn't age very fast, but between the '70s - he looks exactly the same. - I think that's it. - in the flash-forward. He looks like he got scared by a ghost. (laughing) He looks like or one of those Harry Potter Um, the - Yeah, 'cause - and then he's been cursed because and he's been outrunning his destiny Not the people in Peru, not anything. Instead, he's running from his destiny of being killed by some people that meet and work together - because he is trying to kill them. in the span of those girls - [ANASTASIA] Yeah. Just white hair. I feel like we should've seen a little bit because they all play themselves so it has to be soon. - [ANASTASIA] Yeah. It just doesn't - it... (stammering) The environment yeah, what if the movie is, uh, structured a little more where, yeah, it ends with but at the same time, and it's kind of established but then the story mirroring his journey so that without being slow and &quot;Hmm, when I think 'everyone should &quot;Why does that keep happening to me?&quot; This movie... is a prequel, but is it - [JORDAN] No. then why would you do that? You really have to - like, 5D chess that they messed up, where they're like, all these pieces in motion so that...&quot; &quot;...that something like a prequel that has never been committed - should exist.&quot; and you just have no interested in art you're a major top-tier your main hobby is flying then you're gonna okay... the component pieces This fucking thing's been If someone comes up to you and says, &quot;Remember Spider-Man?&quot; (decrepitly) &quot;Yeah, kind of.&quot; &quot;He's the Superman?&quot; &quot;Yeah, sure, mate.&quot; &quot;We're making a movie &quot;Who is that?&quot; &quot;It's just in the comics.&quot; &quot;And she can see the future. &quot;I was 90 when that came out.&quot; And then, like, &quot;Oh, but it's also They're like, &quot;Oh, cool.&quot; And these are all, like, true. But none of them work together. And it's... &quot;It's about her; it's a prequel to - and Spider-Man... his mum is pregnant.&quot; They're like, Like, yeah, but why? Why is it? Why - I mean, the reason Spider-Man's They have to do it joint with Marvel, But there is, like, this... The movie feels very scared - of its most interesting pieces. Uh, can we Google, like... &quot;Best Madame Web interview moments&quot;? [JACOB] Oh my god, they're so funny. 'Cause I haven't seen any of them, <i>I have always really loved Marvel movies.</i> <i>What percent of Marvel movies</i> <i>- have you seen? <i>So, you're a part of the Marvel universe.</i> - She's not a part of it, though. That's the trick. Well, I think people forget. It's like... - These - they don't watch movies. These people are so rich. Why would they watch movies? They have, like, [ANASTASIA] Plus maybe she watches - and this isn't her cup of tea. They have no obligation... This is work! Like, if we went home - Like, they don't watch Marvel movies. What percentage of podcasts - Oh, gee. .4. - [ANASTASIA] I know a lot of, uh, comedy writers who [ANASTASIA] They only watch, - Yeah. It's like I don't watch commentary - And that's just to make fun of them. <i>Madame Web sweep the Oscars. <i>I really like all the Spider-Men.</i> <i>I grew up with Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man.</i> <i>And I kinda wanna bring back</i> <i>- his emo Spider-Man. <i>Sorry, Andrew Garfield.</i> <i>And Tom Holland.</i> <i>And Miles Morales.</i> - (laughing) The man?

And so now I'm unironically like, &quot;I wanna be on her side,&quot; you know? - I like Marvel products just fine now. But I enjoyed this more - since maybe Infinity War. This is a lot like Black Panther. - (laughing) - Yeah. - [ANASTASIA] Mmhmm. - (laughing) Web - Webkanda. Um... Yeah, OK. That was fun. Do you have any more Oh, yeah, I have another one. Uh... - I'll play. I saw the movie, but... what I have, 'cause I didn't make a game for each one, - Yeah, just say some quotes. The first one I have on here is, &quot;New York's getting crazier every day.&quot; Ezekiel Sims hear's Cassie's name. Uh, &quot;I hope the spiders were worth it.&quot; &quot;Ceiling guy.&quot; - &quot;Spider... person?&quot; &quot;But I don't have a - &quot;You did it!&quot; I think you gestured to it already, but the version of &quot;with great power&quot; from a vague Peruvian man. &quot;When you take on the responsibility, great power will come.&quot; - Know what? - That's not how it works. I would go so far as to say that's the Yeah, that man was going for Yoda, &quot;When you take on the responsibility, That is the responsibility. - The power is the responsibility. then you have to be responsible. &quot;With great power - Like, &quot;No, when you are responsibly...&quot; responsibility, and then, Yeah. You just go, like, &quot;I feel like taking responsibility &quot;I'll take responsibility of that.&quot; I never really agreed with that quote. [ANASTASIA] Whenever I take - I can see into the future. I just mopped the floors. I have a feeling when it's gonna be huge. I'd like them to make the same mistake Right now, I just wish - and I can't. The, uh - oh. How did we forget this? The... The perfect line. The final line of the movie. &quot;The best part about the future... is that it hasn't happened.&quot; - (Anastasia &amp; Jacob laughing) - What does that mean? Oh, and &quot;use the web,&quot; - &quot;Use the web.&quot; &quot;Use the web!&quot; (laughing) There's also that pigeon that she saved. - That's right! - That's the scariest scene in the movie. It's momentarily a horror film. - I... the best thing - lifting up the window and then [ANASTASIA] I feel bad for Jacob and we just ruined the whole film. - There's so much more. - [JACOB] I'm more excited. - we want your opinions. - Dude, goddamn. Oh, I was just thinking, by the way, that the best thing about the Wait, wait. Um, I just remembered, there's a scene - Um, at the hospital uh, the nurse comes in and goes, uh, &quot;Are you guys all family?&quot; - &quot;Yes. They're all mine.&quot; And then she's like, [ANASTASIA] &quot;These are - &quot;I birthed all these girls.&quot; And then she's like, &quot;OK, and your flesh-colored [ANASTASIA] Oh my god, - Such a weird choice. 'cause I've just never But they had to do something like... - They didn't have a Cyclops visor ready. [ANASTASIA] Just wrap her Yeah, that would've been cooler. - Then they gave her cool shades. when they do the big reveal, And it's such a funny fan-service for something that no one even knew about. It'd be like if she just, like, turned - It'd be like, at the end &quot;I got... hepatitis.&quot; (laughs) Like, &quot;Oh. OK? Good. All right.&quot; [ANASTASIA] Is that a thing? Yeah, it's just a medical thing, I guess. - Why did she go blind in the movie? - right in the eye. I had the opposite problem. Oh, see, that happened - I whispered to my friend, like, &quot;She's... that would break her back.&quot; - [JORDAN] Her falling in the water? - Uh... and then she is having her, like, &quot;oh, all is lost&quot; moment,&quot; and then gets hit with a There's great comic timing. [ANASTASIA] I wonder if To get smacked in the face with a firework? - Yeah, dude, Kingpin shot her in the face. don't play with fireworks, um, and steal a cab. And use the web. If you steal a cab, you get to keep it. The cab really is the I have the most affection for it. I texted Eddy and you after. Let me see what Eddy said. Some stupid shit, probably. (whiny) &quot;Hey, I got a mustache!&quot; Uh, I said, &quot;OK, Madame Web is He said, &quot;It's incredible. You did it! And then, um... &quot;Did she install the web window or was it the reason - (Anastasia laughing) Oh, I said, &quot;The wheelchair &quot;Her New York City apartment had me The incredibly tall wheelchair, by the way. - Yeah. when you see people It's like the difference between - and a skateboard for doing tricks. Um... I said, &quot;In 2003, if you steal a taxi, Uh, he said, &quot;It's NYC. You'd think somebody would that they bought and No, they took the plates off. Can't do it. [ANASTASIA] Don't you think - would make cops look at you more? - [ANASTASIA] That's suspicious. from the guy that owns the car. This is awesome. I'm glad that Someone tweeted, &quot;Madame Web steals a taxi, and she just has it for No one is looking for it.

[JACOB] But yeah, he just got this position and he moved from California, [JACOB] He was previously married that he was close with. [JACOB] Um... but he moved for work, and then... - [JACOB] So, that's like the first date. [JACOB] They go on they get to know each other really well - - Right. - Like Dr. Death kinda thing, you know? [JACOB] And this is very early stages of the pandemic, - Yeah. - Mmhmm. really hitting it off, um, and he's like, &quot;You know, I just moved here. [JACOB] I don't have um, &quot;yet here, and my family's all out of state.&quot; [JACOB] Um, and so lockdown happens, and he's like, &quot;Would you - Like, quarantine together. &quot;Would you want to quarantine together? and we're hitting it off.&quot; - A lot of people were in that situation. [JACOB] Mmhmm. And and what he had told her is that with relocation fees and gonna help him buy a house, essentially, in Georgia. - OK. and he's getting paid all this money, and they're gonna help him buy just hasn't found one, so [JACOB] And so they decide, [JACOB] She says that they can [JACOB] And she works for, so she, like... makes enough - but is still living paycheck-to-paycheck. [JACOB] She's not, - Yeah, not James Heinz over here. [JACOB] Yeah, and so and they're quarantining together. [JACOB] And some time passes, &quot;Are you still gonna get a house? help you get a house? And if so, or are we gonna move in together?&quot; [JACOB] Things are getting serious. [JACOB] Quarantined together, things - a lot of time with people. - Happened to a lot of us. I won't name any names; - [JACOB] Yeah. [JACOB] So, they decide that they want to live together, and he's like, is $700k,&quot; and so they find a real estate agent and - Which I feel like is gonna get you - some stuff in Georgia. [JACOB] No, it's a town, uh, You know better than me, Yeah, I mean, especially - I feel like $700k goes a long way. [JACOB] She's pretty pumped &quot;Is that, like...&quot; [JACOB] You know, &quot;I couldn't [JACOB] Is that something - with the assistance from your job?&quot; [JACOB] He's like, - [JACOB] Like, &quot;It's chill.&quot; - [JACOB] &quot;Don't worry at all.&quot; I mean, they keep referring like, additional income, but he's like a VP, right?

[JACOB] And he's like, &quot;I have,&quot; like, &quot;several different accounts. [JACOB] But, like, But he's temporarily embarrassed, in that he doesn't have access to his cash? Or is that not...? 'Cause he still is supposed to be paid Or he didn't have the house [JACOB] Yeah. He hadn't found whoever was supposed to be helping him with this assistance was, like, - on maternity leave or something. [JACOB] There was a situation where for a while, and then [JACOB] Um, but he's like, &quot;Yeah, let's start looking for a house.&quot; - and this is like spring 2020, I think. [JACOB] They find a real estate agent they find a house that they like, and they're doing virtual tours - Right. that she really likes and [JACOB] I think it was like $400k. [JACOB] And so they were like, [JACOB] And so he says and he's gonna take care of it all. [JACOB] She doesn't have to worry [JACOB] And so they &quot;They're gonna do an inspection, but the inspector's backed up.&quot; [JACOB] &quot;But it's happening. - &quot;My webcam's broken. I can't do a call.&quot; - &quot;Can't do a call.&quot; bring you guys in, [JACOB] They found... [JACOB] They found - [JACOB] And they're trying to get it. But the inspectors... So, they put the offer in. [JACOB] They put the offer in, - They're in escrow. And they're waiting for, um, But the inspectors, 'cause lockdown, and so I'm sure [JACOB] Yeah. [JACOB] And so I'm gonna bring - [JACOB] four. <i>All right, part four.</i> <i>So, we go to Home Depot; <i>We're choosing all these appliances.</i> <i>He's taking pictures of the, um,</i> <i>the SKU number.</i> <i>We had representatives helping us.</i> <i>And he basically explains to them,</i> <i>&quot;Hey, we're buying a house.</i> <i>Um, we should be closing <i>Can we order this stuff now?</i> <i>Can I put a hold on it?</i> <i>Like, what can we do?</i> <i>'Cause we're not ready for delivery.&quot;</i> <i>I stood there,</i> <i>as the Home Depot rep said,</i> <i>&quot;We can hold it in our warehouse.</i> <i>You can buy something <i>People do it all the time, <i>So I watched him pay.</i> <i>Um... I wanna say it was about -</i> <i>It was either $350 or $500.</i> <i>I watched him pay a deposit</i> <i>on a whole new set of appliances.</i> <i>And they were going to hold it</i> <i>until we were ready for delivery.</i> <i>I watched this.</i> <i>So I was like, &quot;OK, good deal.</i> <i>We got the appliances.</i> <i>Next, let's go to Rooms To Go <i>and find, um, actual furniture.&quot;</i> <i>So we went all around Rooms To Go.</i> <i>We went to Ashley Furniture.</i> <i>We went to American Signature.</i> <i>And I saw all these <i>Again, he's taking pictures of it.</i> <i>He was like, &quot;I can <i>I didn't think anything of it, <i>that we held the appliances.</i> - <i>So I was like, &quot;OK, that's&quot; -</i> - This all seems normal. Man, I'm really struggling she's making with the camera. - I know. - Madame. Web. <i>May 2020 comes. Um...</i> <i>This is where things <i>interesting.</i> <i>May comes, and</i> <i>obviously we had not done inspection.</i> <i>And I'm asking him all the time,</i> <i>&quot;So what's the deal <i>&quot;Oh, because of COVID, they're trying <i>but the guy that they -&quot; <i>&quot;The guy they had caught COVID,</i> <i>so they're gonna have to get somebody else,</i> <i>and he's, like, 15 houses backed up,</i> <i>so it'll be a while.&quot;</i> <i>So at this point, in May -</i> These all sound like real, practical problems that could've happened. Just to what... end? Is he just trying to, like...? - I guess we'll find out. - What is the grift, you know? <i>At this point, in May of 2020,</i> <i>I started recording, um,</i> <i>audio diaries.</i> <i>I don't know why. It was some -</i> <i>Something just made me</i> <i>just start recording <i>and I still have them.</i> <i>I would save them by the date,</i> <i>and, um...</i> <i>I would just start talking about...</i> <i>what's on my mind.</i> <i>So, I was like,</i> <i>I knew - I knew there was something.</i> <i>Something was nagging me, like, &quot;Mm.&quot;</i> <i>But I kept pushing it <i>&quot;You saw...&quot; This is <i>&quot;You saw...</i> <i>him pay for the appliances.&quot;</i> <i>&quot;You know the house is under contract.&quot;</i> <i>&quot;You know that he told you that, um,</i> <i>he's the one who put <i>I remember saying to myself,</i> <i>&quot;Why would he lie about that? <i>&quot;Why would he lie about that?&quot;</i> <i>&quot;Have you caught him in any other lie?&quot;</i> <i>And at the time, the answer was no.</i> <i>Um, so I really was like...</i> <i>&quot;Maybe you just aren't used to a guy</i> <i>who actually does <i>Like, I was questioning myself,</i> <i>and then answering <i>Inspection didn't happen.</i> <i>Around mid-May, - Oh my god. (Jarvis groans) <i>May 2020.</i> <i>When I found out I was pregnant,</i> <i>he was ecstatic, <i>The reason why I was &quot;oh, shit&quot; <i>number two, <i>I felt like it was probably - <i>Um...</i> for Black women in the US, as well. - Yeah. Well, they say &quot;complications;&quot; - Yeah. I gotta say, this is, uh, not based on a... &quot;fellas don't wanna I'm always... The idea of dating someone getting pregnant, and then the guy's like, &quot;Yeah!&quot; - that, I'm like, &quot;Why?&quot; - Yeah. - What's going on there?&quot; Even if it was like... Even the suggestion. Like, if I was getting - Not even married or whatever, like, even with the intensity if he was like, &quot;Hey, like, &quot;Should we start &quot;It's weird that you Especially when they Yeah. She should've known from that. Yeah. (laughs) She should've Madame Webbed into her future TikTok series - Madame Tag. <i>And that... nagged.</i> <i>I cannot tell y'all how much it nagged me.</i> <i>There was a lot of internal struggle.</i> <i>And between - my <i>that he had moved in at this point.</i> <i>I told them, you know, <i>Um, went to the doctor. <i>Um... but again, <i>he couldn't go in with me, <i>So, doing any sort of ultrasound, <i>because my HCG levels were <i>&quot;Hey, it might be twins. <i>Um, &quot;You're still kinda early along.&quot;</i> Gotta love jazz doctors. &quot;Hey! Who knows? Ooh, could be an alien.&quot; - Ooh! &quot;What's up? Oh, - &quot;That's crazy.&quot; <i>They gave me a due date.</i> <i>Due date was January 26th of 2021.</i> <i>Um, so...</i> <i>Yeah. Uh, May, found out I was pregnant.</i> <i>So, there was now more of a push into,</i> <i>&quot;We gotta get a house.&quot;</i> <i>&quot;We gotta get the fuck up outta here. <i>&quot;OK?&quot; Nothing against Riverdale.</i> <i>&quot;But I ain't having a baby in Riverdale.&quot;</i> <i>&quot;We need to find out <i>And so he was very - he was on top of it.</i> <i>He had an answer for everything.</i> <i>Um, he was like, &quot;I'mma call <i>blah-blah-blah.&quot; Um...</i> <i>He then magically told me <i>&quot;Oh, they're gonna do <i>like, in two days.&quot;</i> - <i>So I was like</i> - - You gotta ask to see the house. - [JACOB] Only through virtual - - Just sit in the car. Let me look at it. currently living there until they sell it, - so they couldn't go in. I'll do it from the car. Have them come out and wave. - (laughs) Do they exist? Part of this is, like... a little bit of cope. It's a little bit of, &quot;Is this too good to be true? If somebody is, especially is just like, &quot;Oh, yeah, I'm going out of town again.&quot; &quot;Uh, the trip...&quot; I'm like, &quot;Oh, you're cheating on me.&quot; The thing is, it was such a crazy time... that, like... I think there's a bit of a, um, - fog of war sort of cast on everything. Because, um... It sounds like she was suspicious. She was starting these audio diaries, but she didn't have a tangible reason to distrust him at this point. Um, so she's just kinda getting her thoughts straight, like, working through it. but she's working through it on her audio stuff, - mature way of sort of handling that, like self-consulting. It sounds like she wasn't people outside of it, though, - which is... She told her family she's living with him or that he moved in. - Yeah. her family and herself are, like, - shame, I think, around that? That also makes sense as to why - potentially terminating the pregnancy. [JACOB] So, yeah, she's very religious, she was OK with the idea of - Right. in the back of her head, like, - &quot;Oh, this is not a good thing.&quot; - Man, just an impossible situation. [ANASTASIA] And she's which is totally understandable you know, in early COVID days. - [ANASTASIA] And also - I don't mean in a cynical way, like a - when you're getting housing and... &quot;Is my intuition just me being scared?&quot; - Yeah. Also, she's got this dude who's And she doesn't have a reason to... She doesn't have a - so it's like... - At the best of times wouldn't, and now... &quot;Wow, I really don't wanna - &quot;We need each other,&quot; you know? <i>I guess they did an inspection.</i> <i>He showed me an inspection report.</i> <i>Um, the only thing,</i> <i>they said that the roof <i>which I remember <i>Um, and the issues that there were <i>It was not a bad...</i> <i>'Cause we did have a <i>&quot;It's nothing that we can't handle.&quot;</i> <i>Then he said that we were set to close.</i> <i>Um, the end of May.</i> <i>We were set to close the end of May.</i> <i>He told me it was <i>You're probably like, - I was about to ask. <i>people are not closing in the office.</i> <i>They're doing a Where is she gonna be living - &quot;We'll be Zooming in.&quot; inside the house. - &quot;Let's go to bed.&quot; (mechanical whirring) - &quot;Plug me in.&quot; <i>the paperwork. I wonder if that's even a thing that - 'Cause I think at the end of the day, and I don't know if there's notarize... - those types of documents. I mean, it's different and I was out of the country at the time, out of the US, but like... This is still so early in the pandemic that I feel like a lot of the rules were getting fudged. A lot of stuff was I feel like real estate would be pretty low They could be like, Like, it would... I don't know, &quot;Oh, well, we have to close, so... Zoom?&quot; There isn't - it's so, like - Shit just wasn't as regu - [ANASTASIA] I could also see - because no one's buying or moving, that they're just like, Yeah, 'cause even apartments, people were getting crazy deals on rent I know a lot of people who moved just because it was to take the risk during lockdown. <i>So he was like, &quot;We're set <i>And so, for some reason,</i> <i>again, there's still that nagging part,</i> <i>for some reason,</i> <i>I didn't start packing.</i> <i>Anyone that knows me <i>I've done it enough <i>But I did not start <i>I was just like, <i>My body was changing so fast</i> <i>that it was like I could barely - <i>Um, and so, no, I didn't start packing.</i> <i>And I remember I did record -</i> <i>Again, I was recording <i>When something didn't sit right,</i> <i>I would verbally <i>because I was like, <i>but there's something.&quot;</i> <i>That was the theme of our relationship.</i> <i>&quot;I don't know what it is, <i>Um...</i> <i>And so I remember</i> <i>talking to myself <i>'cause that's where I - <i>and I remember thinking -</i> - So God can hear it. <i>Like, &quot;What if we don't get...?&quot;</i> <i>&quot;What if he's lying?&quot;</i> <i>But again, there goes <i>&quot;Why would he lie about this?&quot;</i> <i>Like, who makes up <i>when in fact they're not?</i> <i>And then he's showing you <i>Like, &quot;Come on. You can't be</i> <i>that jaded</i> <i>that you don't even <i>All right? So,</i> <i>now we're gonna go into part five.</i> Incredible self-awareness - Yeah, good call. - Good timeboxing. she's very good at - putting me on the edge of my seat. [ANASTASIA] Like, &quot;When's Right. And there was a few shoes like the pregnancy reveal. I will say this is, like... prime girl content. 'Cause it's very hangout. - [ANASTASIA] Mmhmm. pomp and circumstance &quot;Fuckin' let's go. &quot;First of all&quot; - like that guy that, uh, was moving the camera close to where he's like, &quot;There was a and she ate all the CHILDREN?&quot; And, like, this is much more just like... &quot;Yeah, I'll listen to 19 hours kind of consumption. The funny thing is we watched commuting somewhere or whatever, and people are like,&quot;When is &quot;This commute is insane, girl.&quot; I'm like, &quot;It's only been...&quot; You know, I guess - wait. How... were all of these parts recorded... - in the same chunk? - [JORDAN] When's the outfit change? like five to eight of them. - Mmhmm. [JACOB] And it's like, you know, - OK. [JACOB] It's kinda broken up <i>OK, part five.</i> <i>&quot;Who the fuck did I marry?&quot;</i> <i>So, I'm questioning <i>out loud in my audio diaries.</i> <i>And then, once again, I'm like,</i> <i>&quot;But look at what he's giving you.&quot;</i> <i>Like, &quot;He's paying&quot; -</i> <i>It wasn't a question about money.</i> <i>It was just a question of,</i> <i>&quot;Are we really about to <i>And keep in mind he's <i>He still is. So...</i> <i>We're supposed to close <i>We didn't. There was an excuse.</i> <i>There was always an excuse with him.</i> <i>Always an excuse.</i> <i>And I didn't know enough about the process</i> <i>to question stuff,</i> <i>because I really wasn't involved</i> <i>the way I should've been.</i> And that's understandable, because like... buying a house is so many - Like, if you haven't gone you could just say, where we all do jumping jacks and then we sign the contract.&quot; And they're not married, and they It's almost like, I mean, she has the visibility of a friend. Like... What, they've known each other What, six months or something? Like, I've, you know... dated people longer than that - [JARVIS] Right. If Katie was going through &quot;Yeah, my work is &quot;OK, I guess I believe you by default. That seems like a very but then at no point am I gonna go, like, &quot;Hmm, I'm gonna log into - Like, I don't know. [JARVIS] Um... Also, what's gonna happen? Like, if you push back on it, he goes, - &quot;Ah, you got me. Ah, you caught me.&quot; Yeah. Also, you don't encounter a lot of so you're not planning where someone has created a false identity. Yeah. And if you ever do meet one, most pathological liars I've met 'Cause it's, like, the pathology and desire to lie and feel perceived, - They're not necessarily smart people. So a lot of compulsive liars will lie and then conflict their own lie - to the same person. This guy just seems Right. That's like what my dad Um, he was saying that... Uh... He was telling me stories about the but I can't tell you I can ask my dad; But only the mayonnaise division, - 'cause he's white. He runs the - they did the ketchup/mayonnaise combo - that one time. Remember that? - [JACOB] Mayochup? Dude, that's you and me. We're a blend. - Do they call it &quot;mayochup&quot;? - Jesus Christ. - Of a ketchup bottle? - &quot;Kranch&quot; is funny. [JACOB] Oh, I think we talked about it. - Seemingly ranch is so funny. [ANASTASIA] Ketchup ranch. Oh. - Kranch. - Huh. I would be disappointed to get that. You know, like sometimes You guys been to Big Chicken? I mean, Poor Shaq. He got sniped on &quot;shack&quot; Big Chicken, Shaq's chicken brand... - Mid. They just have that, what is it? The... They have some &quot;Shaq sauce,&quot; &quot;Well, I'm not gonna know Yeah. Or Mac Sauce, &quot;Oh... kay.&quot; &quot;Good. I guess you could You call it Kranch and then Yeah, it's like if every sauce - Yeah. &quot;Vinesalt.&quot; &quot;Oh, it's fries.&quot; - Sorry; chips. Poti-sa-oil. Fried. - &quot;What is this? I don't want this.&quot; &quot;Can I have a burger, please?&quot; <i>...should've been. And it <i>So I'm pregnant with a lot of anxiety.</i> - <i>Um...</i> - <i>And I'mma be 100% honest with y'all -</i> Sorry. Yeah, one thing as if you weren't already from the smokescreen of and this new relationship a lot of people doubt themselves and, by medical professionals are told to doubt themselves - [ANASTASIA] Right. you're experiencing stuff, Like, feelings you've never felt. I guess you could think your And you're probably being told it. I'm sure if she said it, he'd probably go, Could be crazy woman stuff!&quot; Yeah, definitely not something - I'll give it a swing. <i>Around June 5th...</i> <i>I looked at the house again on Realtor.com.</i> <i>I don't know what - I don't know why you didn't before.<i> <i>I know that people are like...</i> <i>You know, you may or <i>but I'm telling you I <i>probably the Holy Spirit was like,</i> <i>&quot;Look at that house on Realtor.com.&quot;</i> <i>So I looked at the house on Realtor.com.</i> Dude, that was the Holy Spirit, being like, &quot;Woman, do it! Get a fucking move on!&quot; She's like, &quot;Well, I've got all these and it hasn't closed yet, and it's been - &quot;OK, let's get it going!&quot; - &quot;I don't know.&quot; Just Googles for her. Um, in Madame Web, Oh, god, yeah, dude. - I don't know. just by the size of the final word, - &quot;You are web.&quot; Oh, maybe. &quot;You will web.&quot; But, uh... But this one said &quot;Visit Realtor.com.&quot; - [JACOB] It was an ad for Realtor.com. - &quot;What do you think it means?&quot; Sponsored fortune cookies have to stop. - Pepsi. &quot;Drink Pepsi.&quot; <i>This was around June 5th.</i> <i>It showed that - Mm.<i> <i>&quot;OK, wait. What does that mean? <i>Because ex-husband is telling me <i>&quot;We're about to close. It's our house.&quot;</i> 'Cause, like, the house Like, it could go off the market - [JACOB] Yeah. contracts are being You would have to look at - you can look at the timeline of the history of the house Yeah, 'cause they don't wanna - after the inspection and in escrow. Fees submitted, and stuff. - <i>We got furniture, blah-blah.</i> <i>Um, he's also telling me</i> <i>that he's been in contact <i>who was telling him, &quot;This is what I don't like that the realtor's his friend. [JACOB] Oh, there was part of the story that I missed earlier, kinda breezed over, is that when they found this house, brought on or hired or whatever, um... [JACOB] Like, things were and she was just curious about it, so she called the realtor herself and, uh, the realtor was like, &quot;Well, no, - I don't know what's going on.&quot; And then - I thought you were gonna say [JACOB] Yeah. Well, no, it was - [JACOB] So she brought it up to him - [JACOB] Yeah. Later that day, &quot;I called the realtor, and [JACOB] And he got mad that &quot;Let me handle it, because I'm and I was gonna hire him so that he could get the bonus or the cut of the sale.&quot; - Yeah. &quot;You're thinking of [JACOB] He's like, It's almost admirable Sometimes I think to myself, I should just lie. I should just Half the time, stories like this, I've listened to one and the story's ticking along &quot;Hmm, some suspicious behavior, and and then she found the corpse, and then with a slip of his DNA. And then she asked him and it worked. Like, it's... What do you mean, &quot;No, it is my friend&quot;? I'm like, &quot;No, well... No, let me talk to him as well, then.&quot; Do you own him? Like, Groucho - (stammering) A Groucho mask match march. - Of masks. <i>apparently is completely <i>But again, I was not heavily involved.</i> <i>So I'm just like, <i>I see it's off-market.</i> <i>What the fuck does <i>Like, now I'm really freaking out.</i> <i>So, it shows the name of</i> - <i>the real estate agent</i> - <i>for the seller.</i> <i>I don't remember her name.

It's one of those - Yeah, so I'm - a very real real estate agent. - that they were looking at. [JORDAN] Didn't some shit <i>&quot;Really?&quot; (laughs) Um...</i> <i>And she said, &quot;Yes, ma'am.&quot; <i>&quot;My sellers sold the house.&quot;</i> <i>And I was like, &quot;Oh, man, OK.&quot;</i> <i>&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;my husband <i>We loved the pictures of it,</i> <i>and we're getting <i>so I would've loved to have <i>to see it.&quot;</i> <i>I asked her something.</i> <i>I don't remember <i>and I don't even - <i>because I was anticipating</i> <i>that my boyfriend at the time</i> <i>was going to have <i>So I asked her something - <i>And I remember, somehow -</i> <i>Again, forgive me. I don't <i>But the answer was that <i>Older white couple.</i> - This is cool. <i>I record an audio diary,</i> <i>and in the audio <i>&quot;OK, there is no house.</i> <i>He's gonna have to <i>Because now I realize, <i>he was lying about, um,</i> <i>him being the one who was under contract.</i> <i>I knew enough about that.</i> <i>So, I was like,</i> &quot;What,&quot; um... <i>&quot;How is he gonna get out of this?&quot;</i> <i>Again, I've listened <i>I literally said in <i>&quot;How is he gonna Do you think that the people know that history is occurring in the car next to them? You think a license plate-free cab - whipping past on its way to Peru is...? Three teenage girls in the back? Future spider-women? But currently Future in the sequel that'll never happen. Is she gonna use the web? She's kind of developing something of a... - a future-seeking - but I'm thinking she should be I'm just... how many... - total videos did you say there were? - [JARVIS] That's awesome. how this gets sustained. 'Cause this is so - What's his cover gonna be? from it being very, very clear. - This is like a Baldur's Gate story. into these, like, grander and grander lies, and he has people, like... [JACOB] He's just so good essentially this woman who, you know, - placed her faith in him and trust in him, and is obviously taking advantage of that. [JACOB] And he just, like, [ANASTASIA] It's interesting; at this - Yeah. I mean, again, I'm not trying to ascribe any kind of blame whatsoever to her, but there is this almost &quot;Oh my god, run. No, I know COVID. Like, it's already at this point of, But we're already past Like, approaching, &quot;This is potentially - a dangerous person.&quot; Well, yeah, but this is how the 'Cause, like, we're hearing her But when she's in the thick of it, I'm sure that there's a lot And she's also in a situation where she isn't able to confide fully She's being very consciously [JARVIS] Yeah. I don't know but if you know that you're this religious background and they might be risking potentially, um, ostracizing themselves from their family and close ones and loved ones, if they... get deeper in this relationship. Like, god forbid you get pregnant. Now she's out on a limb with very limited people in her community, and - That's how manipulators work. a rhythm, and then you kind of Yeah, it's like actual gaslighting, not like the way that we use it currently. - [JORDAN] Yeah, not just lying to someone. [JORDAN] And you've created, like, This, the way her life now works, the way they... She goes to work, she gets home, &quot;I cook meals on Mondays; This is what we do. This is what we Can you drive? I'm feeling All of that, it's like people and have a gambler's fallacy, like, &quot;Well, I can't break up now. What, I'm gonna waste those 10 years?&quot; And that's by design. That's why as appealing or as reliable and then by the time... it's revealed you can't buy - [JARVIS] Yeah. <i>on how he's gonna do it.</i> <i>And something said to me, <i>I said, um,</i> <i>&quot;He's gonna say it's a bad deal,</i> <i>and he's gonna say - Whoa. - <i>So, I have a decision to make.</i> <i>As ugly as this decision was,</i> <i>I made the decision,</i> <i>&quot;You're about to have <i>He's paying all the household bills.</i> <i>Let him get out of the lie.&quot;</i> <i>And that's what I did.</i> <i>I purposely made the decision</i> <i>that I knew he was <i>and I knew he was going <i>on why he couldn't buy the house,</i> <i>'cause he didn't know</i> <i>that I knew that house was already sold.</i> I was curious about the financial owner. A tiny little part of me 'Cause if he's lying about this, but does he make any lie here? But if he is covering Either there's some income, or [ANASTASIA] She saw him I mean, with that clarifying point, which is like, financial independence is any relationship, regardless of type. You can live with a sibling, you have over somebody. That's the thing. You could you don't wanna test the waters, and you can't find a sub-lease in time, It's a sticky wicket. <i>'Cause most women in their right mind</i> <i>would have been like, &quot;I'm out.&quot;</i> <i>And I didn't.</i> <i>So, um, sure enough,</i> <i>he came home.</i> <i>He didn't really say <i>The next day, <i>And he said, &quot;My <i>um, he was like, <i>because something's going on</i> <i>with the interest rate.&quot;</i> - Mm. - <i>I...</i> - Mm. are all up the wrong...&quot; Also, dude, it's 2020. - at an all-time low. - Yeah. Yeah, brother. You gotta get in there. - It's too good a time. <i>...felt so much relief,</i> <i>because I knew <i>&quot;He's gonna give me some bullshit.&quot;</i> <i>So when he said &quot;there's <i>I said, &quot;You know what? If the&quot; -</i> <i>This is literally <i>&quot;If the interest rate isn't good,</i> <i>then we shouldn't move there.&quot;</i> <i>&quot;We should probably let this house go.&quot;</i> <i>&quot;We should cancel</i> <i>whatever furniture we ordered,&quot;</i> <i>or appliances,</i> <i>&quot;and let's just look for another house.&quot;</i> <i>I said, &quot;I would like to be moved <i>I said, &quot;I really don't wanna - <i>moving into a house. I would like</i> <i>to be done with this before then.&quot;</i> <i>And the way I said it was so calm,</i> <i>and he was like, &quot;OK.&quot; He was like,</i> <i>&quot;I'mma call&quot; the <i>&quot;and tell him I'm <i>and I'mma see if I can get <i>And I remember looking at him. So, she planted a trap, 'cause she knew... that the house was already off the market and sold to this older white family. So she was creating a situation where he... had to, like, sort of make up a new lie. And she's got that, uh, - the metadata on that audio recording. You know? It's kinda like sending Speaking of, this is - getting optioned within the month. please let her make a big bag off of this. At the very least, like, - uh, Wondery's gonna option it. [JACOB] I watched a short, uh, interview of her where she said that, um, she only... at the end of last week had been able to join the Creator Fund, but then they banned her for reuploading videos. - That's crazy. - That pisses me off. That's such bullshit. [ANASTASIA] For expediency's sake, - [ANASTASIA] Does she have the baby? [JACOB] So, she does not have the baby. [JACOB] There is a complication with - Mm. [JACOB] There's some during that process, - where he's not there for her, and... [JACOB] Um, which - Yeah. - that he's trying to buy. Yeah, I assume at this loop is continuing, right? - Like, &quot;I found this house.&quot; [JACOB] He claims that so they go and shop around - for a bunch of Land Rovers. [JACOB] He claims that he's - It's all on credit. - [JACOB] But they never get the cars. - [JACOB] There's always reasons why. that he can, like, sort of promise something Like, 'cause the conclusion is that he's the most unlucky man alive. I had, um - Somebody once explained to me, uh... They were like a mental health counselor. They weren't specifically a psychiatrist, people that were self-awarely - Some people with borderline, but this was also like and I think the language was still... in the UK, at least, was still That was often the terminology used, and pathological lying was The way somebody once described it, is they said it was like... literally like an addiction, where they are imbibing this feeling of lying, of status, and it just - the desperation to have it, the desire for it, like, supersedes even one hour of pre-planning. Like, &quot;I want my fix now.&quot; &quot;I want to say I'm working on a new house. to look impressive, let's &quot;I want that feeling today, And on Friday... Friday doesn't even exist. &quot;I get it today, I feel good I get it again, And, like - I mean, then yeah, you... 'Cause I feel like anybody else, If, for some reason, I would be awake every single with a different one I told? Am I...? When's this all gonna explode?&quot; I don't know; if it makes you Um, she's got her Cash App here. - [JORDAN] Oh! I think we can afford especially for watching these But I also, if anyone especially if she's not getting, like... She's not getting Creator Fund? Not even - The Creator Fund isn't even, like, doesn't even pay you a good rate. There's other who reupload. - I mean, maybe she did. Do we know why? 'Cause they don't want you to juice Why...? Do we know why she would have to do that? She might've had a video [JACOB] There are actually a couple, because part three isn't even Yeah, and so if she reuploads something because TikTok has a fucking minefield of just various things that you can - accidentally trip over, then you might reupload something much like we do on YouTube but TikTok doesn't have such a system. I mean, they did have that, um... - little warning at the bottom of those - Maybe if there was a more egregious - or she took a sharp turn. [JACOB] Really, the rest of it is her that he got into, and she kind of is, like, &quot;In hindsight, I believed that he just kind of got off on...&quot; - like, promising her things that she could never have, and seeing her excitement and [JACOB] Just, like... that's so, like... Seeing her momentary excitement, - like, time and time again. Literally, I mean, we kind of... you know, joked about it, but It is, like, &quot;I want to feel good &quot;And I'm... my brain is not developed to the point where I understand that, like, something worse will happen later.&quot; It's like that, uh, experiment with a kid, and they're like, In 10 minutes, if you It's like, &quot;I can't - a minute is a year.&quot; - [JARVIS] Right. Her Cash App is, for audio listeners, $ - - Just 'cause that's how Cash App works. $-R-E-E-S-A, M-T-E-E-S-A, $ReesaMTeesa. I'm sending her stuff right now. Hopefully, uh, like a subset of NPR and then, I don't know, Lifetime puts a project together [ANASTASIA] Do you remember, a viral Twitter thread about... these, um, strippers who drove to Florida? [ANASTASIA] And it's &quot;I'm telling my story about how my friend and coworker was like, 'Let's drive to Florida, and then drive back,' - and then all this crazy stuff happened&quot;? - [ANASTASIA] It got turned into a movie. - Yeah, I saw it. It's good. [ANASTASIA] And it's really interesting, 'cause they were able to verify, like, &quot;This is actually her story,&quot; you know, &quot;and we can license it from her.&quot; Yeah. [ANASTASIA] So I just feel like these very interesting stories that are getting put on social media... [ANASTASIA] You know, it's fodder for - other forms of entertainment. paid and don't just get And that - yeah, I mean, the shitty thing is that... even if she - and Someone is reaching out. Everything I know, I can - I know the type of voice that when they get excited about this shit. - [JARVIS] Salivating. My fear would be that... without any kind of representation, I don't think she will know Like, 'cause they're gonna say, - &quot;We'll give you $50,000 for your story.&quot; - [JARVIS] Right. And then just not - you don't know what, It's the same in a lot of You have very basic CPM rules of thumb in terms of what you but, uh, there hasn't been a sort of transparency project uh, trying to, like... um... sort of help out because I get a lot of... you know, smaller creators or I've been lucky to have been reached out who've since become larger creators, give as much advice and stuff as I can. Um, but there's no way of Um, and there's a lot of time A lot of the time, &quot;Man, uh, have... very good management.&quot; A lot of the time with partnership stuff especially, on, like, the... 'Cause it should be Like, you are the... You are the billboard. You're the Times Square screen. Right, so as long as there But they... People looking for projects like this in some weird, like, deliberately... obscure corporation, the reason they keep them obscure is so that they seem like genius, intimidating monolith, and they know what's right for you. &quot;$50,000 is exactly the money I I mean, what am I gonna do, Which somebody that's like or partnerships person is going to I know the Dr. Death lady, and [ANASTASIA] Also, [ANASTASIA] You know, [ANASTASIA] It's really hard to where you're producing new content - that people wanna watch. [ANASTASIA] I think most people, it's they're like, &quot;What? I can't do this - Yeah, exactly. - into something else I do wanna do?&quot; what the legality is of, like... I'm pretty sure, like... NPR can just do an make a billion off it, and then - she doesn't have to be involved at all. Oh, sorry. What the fuck am I thinking of? - Uh, Wondery, not NPR. They can just stack it with ads and make a bag, it costs 10 grand - and it's reporting, so it's not... That's tricky, yeah. So I'm hoping... - Hoping she sees her bag. Cash App read in descrippy, too. - In the doobly-do? Do you remember that, to the side or something? It's always like, it was over here - Um... All right, are we - - [JACOB] Yeah, true. I know we've got It's long. That is all for today. Uh, just kidding. - We're gonna head over to - We're gonna head on over and have our Patreon-exclusive where we're gonna talk about and there's gonna be a lot of spoilers. And if you wanna - My brain's falling apart. It's the web. - $5 a month will get you god knows how many episodes - [JARVIS] A lot. [JACOB] I can confirm for you right now that it's... 52. - 52?! That's as many - - That's one for every week. 52 additional episodes of Sad Boyz, - just over a year. get it and quit it if you want. - Like, no pressure. Just make sure you're only using your discretionary entertainment spending. This is not a handout. Eat up the pod. - Bounce if you gotta. We end every episode of Sad Boyz - We love you! (high-pitched) Boom! Just finished Baldur's Gate. No! My god, really?! Yeah, I finished it - on Tactician. No big deal. Uh, no big deal. Honour Mode next. (laughs) No. But yeah, I just finished it. And, uh, it was fun. I think my playthrough You know, I felt like I saw (outro music)
