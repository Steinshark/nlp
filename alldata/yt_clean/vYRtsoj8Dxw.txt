The war is over! You hear me? The war is over! The war is over! You don't try nothing foolish now, do you? Yesterday you would have been a hero. But today you'll just be a dead fool. Throw down your weapons. To the war! How do I know you're not lying to me, Sergeant? If you don't believe me, ask your old man. Hey, Matt! Bring him down! One of yours, ain't he? I'm Colonel David R. Donovan. Colonel Donovan? That's right. Is the war really over, sir? Yep. But how, sir? Lee surrendered at Appomattox. When? Three days ago. So it's finished. Yeah, the war's over, Lieutenant. We can all go home. Think you better do what they ask. We lost it. Yeah. All right, throw down your arms. All right, off your horses. Better get down, Lieutenant. Yeah. Come on. Got a cigar? Yes, sir. Good man. Want a light, sir? No, thanks. Where do you live, Lieutenant? Little Rock. In Arkansas, sir. Yeah, that right. Yes, Colonel. Well, you're a long way from home, ain't you? Yes, sir. Best I can figure it. That's at least a twenty-day walk, Lieutenant. Look at him run! Twenty day walk, huh? Sure. And a ten day run! Oh, run rabbit! Look at him go! Alright Bugle Boy, I changed my mind. Let's see the color of your underpants. Come on. Now don't start playing coy, soldier. Yeah. Donovan, where the hell have you been? Just rustling a cannon or two. Murder gang, now using stolen army cannon in bank robberies? Why, shit. And it's thirteen, black and odd. Here you are, sir. And you, sir. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen, place your bets. Place your bets, please. One dollar on sixteen, yes, sir. Now, the limit of any one number or color is twenty-five dollars. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen. Place your bets, please. That's a twenty-five dollar limit. Place your bets, please. Place your bets. That's the last call on bets. Five thousand. on your life, Becker. Stay on the wheel of it. Spin it. on When it stops. HO woo ow mer wo It's the principle, Mr. Rainey. Ah, good morning, Mr. Aguasanta. Good morning, Mr. Aguasanta. It's a pleasure to see you again. Tell me, how have you been? Well? I swear, you're looking younger these days. Business has been good, huh? I can tell by the smile on your face. Come in. Hey, Come in. Come on into my office. After you, Mr. Aguasanta. After you. No one will disturb us in here. Please, go ahead. Sit down. I imagine your work is going well. Since the war ended last month, there's been a great deal of activity amongst the criminal element. Which in one way is bad, but for you, it means a growing bank balance. And that's the important thing in life, isn't it? Well now, sir, how much would you like to deposit this time? Five thousand. I'd like to see my statement. Certainly, sir. Once. Here. Everybody knows that our famous Aguasanta Joe prefers to pull a trigger than pull a leg. But despite the many slights on his profession, he's a man of great scruples. He's a man of honor, with as good an eye for business as he has for straight shooting. If you give me the interest on his capital, that'll make fifty thousand. Signore, ti prego. The next information you want, I have to charge extra. The cost of living, she's rising. Wait a moment. Come in. Look, I'd really prefer a redhead. Where's Aguasanta, Joe? Well, Didn't you hear that question? Uncle Santa, I already picked out a box for you. You wouldn't want me to meet St. Peter in the nude, would you? No matter to me, none. All hell. Last request. Gentlemen, they must be tracked down and caught or shot. They've had a free run for two years, and that's more than enough. Excuse me, sir. I... What is it, Major? Donovan and his gang used cannon to take the Lancaster bank yesterday, sir. Cannon? Well, that's it, gentlemen, isn't it, now? It was Colonel Donovan who stole those cannons. And I'm quite certain there are no other outlaw gangs equipped with artillery. So we know for sure which raids he was responsible for in the past six months. Let's pinpoint those raids and see if we can see any sort of pattern to his movements. He's restricted, gentlemen. It should be easy to track him down. No one can travel quickly with cannon. According to all reports, no one has ever seen Hyde in the hair of those cannon before or after raid. That might signify that he has two or three and that he doesn't move around very much. Which might mean he To certain areas. Let's say, for instance, the triangle formed by Lancaster, Sweetwater, and Del Rio. Then let's try there, Captain. Yeah! Halt! Get the manager, Colonel Donovan. Morning, Colonel. You better tell everybody to leave. Every? What do you mean? Official order. Orders to close up the bank. But why would the Army want to close up the bank? What orders? A requisition order. Ah, I understand. Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid you'll have to leave as we're closing the bank earlier than usual today. Official Army orders. Good. Didn't you say a rec position, Colonel? Yeah, that's right. Requisition. But that only there belongs to the But... The Army is run short of fun. But you just can't. Oh, yes, I can. Open the safe. You're impersonators. I'm not opening anything. What's the time? time. You want another time? What difference does it make? keeps... Yeah, careful with that. Three minutes to twelve. He's slow. Two minutes. You have two more minutes to open that strong box. Just two more minutes. No, I won't open it. I won't. It won't make me do it. He's got just half a minute, according to my reckoning. You don't scare me. You don't scare me in the least. A quarter minute? Jack. Fifteen seconds. Welp. All right. If you won't open it... Acquiescent! Acquiescent! Your coffee is approved. Si, I know. For some reason, it's green. Just drink. It's a good coffee. Don't do it, Joe. Forget about it. Bring him, Donovan. It would be utter madness. Especially if you tried to do it alone. He's a wolf. You would not get within a mile of the man. Maybe you could, but I want more of a No, cut. Well, if there's nothing else doing these days, I accept twenty, all right? I reckon you would. Oh, Donovan's right-hand man, who deserted the band, he took off on him. And Donovan wants to get his hands on him. I hear he's molto mad at having lost his little Charlie that way. And he put a reward on him. And I know the reward is a big one. Five times what the ferals are paying, if you deliver him alive. Who's there? You're dreaming. I saw a man's face out there. I'll go take a look. Tell me something. What's done of it pain for my skin? Ten thousand dollars. Silence. lot of money for a son of a bitch. You say that again, I'll kill you. Or you'll have to shoot me. See, my mother just died. Well, that's why I come to town. Come to pay my last respects to her. That's it. I come to town to pay my last respects to my dear old mother. In a whorehouse? Poor mother. I guess I am a son of a bitch. But don't you say it. Get dressed. Ten thousand dollars, eh? Thank you. Thank you very much. There we are. Now, do I look all right? Dreaming. I'm going. Momma. Momma, don't eat me! Bring the Bible, and let's get this over with. Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry come unto you. Let us pray. O God, who art alone, merciful and sparing of punishment, we pray you in behalf of the soul of your servant, whom you have commanded to go away today from this world. Do not hand her over to the power of the enemy, and do not forget of her. You know, Agua Santa, it ain't that I mind going back to face a court-martial. It's hanging afterwards that I mind. You know, you're almost as famous as Donovan. That's saying a lot for a bounty hunter. Now, where'd you ever get your name, anyway? Agua Santa. Holy water. When I was a kid, my father used to sell whiskey to the Indians. They called him Firewater and started calling me Holy Water. Later on, when I was growed up, I went to Mexico and got a change to Aguasana. Satisfied? Well, it's a good story. here. All right, we're here. We're where? At the end of the damn road, as far as I'm concerned. My bladder's almost bursting. You don't understand, damn it? I gotta pee. Hello. No! Come on. You want me to ruin this saddle? All right. All right. Go on. Don't worry. I ain't watching you. Ain't you through yet? Hey, what the blazes are you doing over there? Run, Charlie. I'm not gonna... I've got to get out. I've got to get out of here. I've got to get Riding a horse is much easier. How you there? You keep your hands off me, you bastard! Eyebinder! Hey, hold it! My shirt is getting ruined there. out Ha ha ha ha ha! Maybe it's better if you went home for a while. No. I'd rather be with you. Two riders coming in from the east! Acqua Santa Joe. Well, now. With our old friend, Charlie. I knew you'd come back to us sooner or later, Charlie. One way or the other. I must say I didn't take too kindly to the way you deserted the troop. Sure is good to have you back in the ranks again. Step down, Charlie. Order your old friend. Leave him alone, Colonel. He's mine. Do you mean you brought him out here just to show him off to us? Is that right? No, he's for sale. For sale, is he? All right, I'll take Tell you what. Ten thousand. For that? Ten... Thousand... Dollars? For that? it. Well, damn it all. I give you three thousand, but that is the limit. Now, nobody in his right mind would refuse three thousand dollars for that. Just think of me as crazy. I'll make you one last offer. I'll pay you four thousand dollars. Ten. Damn it all to hell. This is ridiculous. Why should I pay ten thousand dollars for a man we're going to hang? Wait a minute. I got an idea. Why don't you deal with the man, Sergeant? He might listen to you. All right, friend, get off. Aw, shit. Six thousand? I said ten. You did. Hmm. Pay him. You wanted Charlie, and he brought him to you. I'll sweat every cent out of your hide. I've got to get Why such a big reward? Charlie ran off with a contribution we received from the bank in Austin. You got a cigar? Special for my clients. Well, now. All right. Tell me, whereabouts did you find Charlie? Lancaster. Betty gave you quite a run for your money, huh? Yeah, it was pathetic. Pathetic. There's nothing pathetic. About Charlie here, sir? At the funeral, there was. What's that? He went to Lancaster to bury his mother. But, Bury his mother. I'm tellin' you, that man ain't got a mother. He was spawned on a hot rock and weaned on local weed. Mother died. Bring him over here. Agua Santa, you may leave. Now then, Charlie. Well. Colonel, I didn't desert. I just went to bury my poor old mother. Sit down, Charlie. So, you went off to bury your poor old mother, huh? Where's my money? What money? Now, Charlie, come. Have you forgotten about all my money that you stole from your old friends? I don't know what you're talking about. Now then, where's my money, Charlie? I spent it all. Oh, you did, huh? Burying my poor old mother. Went with a coffin. Couldn't send her away in a cheap one. Didn't seem right. I spent it all. Well, you sure must have loved her, your poor old mother, huh? Yeah, I sure did. Charlie. right, you can have him. Take him. Come on, Charlie boy! Come on and get a bucket! What happened? Shall we start again? That bucket of truth medicine worked. I'm ready to tell you everything. Where's my money? I buried it with my mother. It's in her coffin. Huh. You buried it with your mother. It's in her coffin, huh? Why didn't you tell me that before, Charlie? I forgot about it. You forgot about it. All right. Sergeant. We're going grave robbing. Get the horses. this is it, start diggin'. That son of a bitch, he was lying! Let's put a rope around his neck! Yeah, I agree with you. Let's get back to camp. We'll put a rope around his neck and haul him up, slowly let him choke to death. Well, Colonel, what are we going to do? I don't know. Maybe go back to the game. I see. Know what you boys are going to be charged with when I try you? But you can't blame me. Charlie escaped during heat. It's gone. Nobody gave him permission to rest. He should have been awake to help me. All right. All right. No court martial this time. You still got to learn a lesson. Get ready. Next time I give you orders, better stick to them to the letter. got to get out Gentlemen, I'd like to hear your comments, if you have any to make. Colonel, What do you have to say? I'm all for the idea, sir. I think it'll work. I agree, sir. Well, we've got nothing to lose, and it's worth trying anything to bring in Donovan's bunch. And his idea's a good one. all right. We'll try it your way, sir. Get things moving, Colonel. Yes, sir. Take him away. Let's go. Move it. Come on. If this plan of yours works, you'll make a little money. I'll see you get the reward that's offered on Donovan's gang. Oh, I agree. It's not a fortune. Not too bad, though. It'll come to about five thousand. How's that sound to Colonel, I'm not greedy, but I was thinking of more like thirty thousand. you? Did I hear you say thirty thousand? You think money grows on trees, eh? That goes in banks, Colonel. But you see, unfortunately, banks tend to get held up, and that's how it happens I lost all my cash. Our man Donovan got it. And Donovan is an Army Colonel. So I'm holding the Army responsible. of here. This carpetbagger wants to talk to you, Colonel, about a deal he's got. Bring him over here. Hey, Sisley, come talk to the Colonel. I have a message from Acquasanto. Let's hear it. He has a dealer for you. Let's hear it. It's a dealer that will make you both many thousands of dollars. Let's hear it. It's regarding your man, Charlie Logan. Where is Charlie? The army got him. Just what is Acquasanto's deal? The deal is to rescue Charlie out of jail. I've How? We must talk price first. Give him another ten thousand. Eh, the cost of living, she's going up. He wants thirty thousand. Thirty thousand. Oh, forget it. It's like the man said himself. Crazy. You should pay it, Colonel. This way, you not only get your man Charlie back, but also the thirty thousand you pay Acquasanto. What do you mean, how do we get back the thirty? You gonna bring it to us? Eh, no, not exactly. What I can tell you for a small fee is where he banks his money, so you can go and collect. Donovan, that's one of the best double crosses. This is I've heard from you for a long time. So, why'd he send you? Why? Because he has faith. He can depend entirely on this Sicilian here. You wanna hear the plan? Yeah. We put all of your men in my way. Why? Did you ever read about the attack on Troy City? And the wooden horse they use? No. Illiterate bastard. And I suppose this horse ain't wooden shavings. got Dammit, he's fired! I'll spook that horse and it'll run! Gladius! Foundry Creek. But Colonel, we're winning. Point going on. The prize is swinging. A blue retreat or you'll face a court martial. But I don't know the retreat, sir. Well, now's the time to learn it, soldier. Oh... Don't bother! We're getting out there. Come on, move it. Oh, shoot. The general ain't gonna like this. I was expecting you. What kept you so long? I had other business. Alright, let's go. Agua Santa. Oh. Annie, go on. Got any last requests? Mr. Agua Santa. Just don't ask for a woman or a bandage over your eyes. You already had the one. You're not plum out of the other. Ready? Hold it, Donovan. It was me who took the money off Charlie. I told him to say it was in the coffin. Lower your guns. Bring him back to camp. So, you and Charlie worked out that story about the cough. You hid the money. Naturally, you're going to tell us where it is. Well, where did you hide the money? That's enough, Sergeant. Like hell it is. I'm going to make him talk. I give the orders around here. Then you've got a problem on your hands, Colonel. I'm through taking your orders. Do you understand? We're gonna do things my way now. Look at the mess you made of things. Today that happened because, Sergeant, someone went against my order. You know damn well I never gave the order to fire. But somebody in our bunch stuttered it, and I'm pretty sure I know who it was. And talking about messes, what about this? Kicking our only source of information to death. You kill this man and that money's a goner. Listening to your ranting no longer. I got my own ideas on how to run things. And he'll talk, you needn't worry about that. So get to the back of the line, because from now on you're gonna follow my orders. Understand? And if that ain't to your liking, you can ride out of here. Donovan. Allright, If you want to follow this dumb bastard, it's your funeral. Go ahead, he's all yours. Make him talk. Get him on his feet, I'll make him sink fast enough. to get out of here. Sergeant, I got one last word of advice for you, and that's to get out of camp. Agua Santa told the Federals where they could find us. They're liable to come riding in any minute now. I've no intention of sticking around to welcome them. That makes sense. I vote we move out of here. Yeah, I would never fight off a troop of Federals. We'd better find ourselves another base. The money's got to be somewhere near Lancaster, so we ought to head in that direction. Good idea. Let's move. We can work on him later. Put him on a horse. And watch him, he's slippery as a snake. So, this is what the son of a bitch came here to do. I'm gonna tie it to his head when I'm through with him. I've got to get out of here. We're losing the wheel! Give me a hand! Cup pin dropped out. Have to lift a little. Jet, you lift, we'll push. Hold it, boys, I got a better idea. Here we go. One, two. Three... Heave. Two... And again! Two... We don't seem to be very popular, do we? See, guys? You're worse off than I am. You can't spend dollars where you're going. Pity, ain't There you are with a mountain of dollars and gold in your hands and not a chance of being able to spend it in hell. It's kind of ironical. You know what I'd do if I were you? In your situation, I'd try real hard to find a friend or temporary associate. Of course, if you find someone willing to give you a hand, you'll have to really make it worth his while. Now, that'd be what I'd call doing a real smart thing, eh? That's it, boys. All right, let's move out. Have you decided yet? I'm losing my patience, mister. I'm gonna give you just one more minute. What's the matter with you, you wanna die? Where's the money, you son of a bitch? All right, mister, your one minute is up. I'm lighting the fuse. Take cover, man! He's gonna blow! Get off my back! of here. I've got to get out of here. I've got to get out of here. I've got to get out of here. I've got to get out of here. I've got to get out of here. I've got to get out of here. Mound up! Mound up, dammit! Let's get him! Get my stick! I've got to get out of here. I've got to get out of here. I've got to get out of here. I've got to get out of here. I've got to get out of here. I've got to get out of here. What's wrong? Lost your weight? No, I just don't like your gun sticking in my back. This is it. This is it? That's what I said. All right. Now, don't try anything stupid, will you? You see, I've been losing a lot of friends lately. I don't want to lose you. You ain't going to trust me in there alone, are you? I am. Somebody's going to keep watch in case of Let's come along. All right, but I may be a while. Yeah? I'll be waiting. Did it occur to you the others could be waiting outside for us? It did. Maybe you and me will another way out. Yep. I'll be waiting here. Move it. The others can't be that far behind. Have you found her yet? Aguasana, have you found the money yet? find... No. Dark in here. Hey, now, let's move it. Come on. Wait a minute. Think I found it. Well? Aguasana. Aguasana? Aguasana! Aguasala! Shit. You rotten, lying, double-crossing, yellow-bellied son of a bitch. got to get out of here. I've got to get out of here. Going somewhere? I got one more bullet. Save your bullet. We got guests coming. Won't work with me. Well, I hear horses. So you did. Bruce? Yeah, maybe we should. It'll only be a temporary truce, all right? Yeah. Go on. Come on. Thanks. Know anybody who needs a wet nurse? Could be, I do. But I don't need a spare tit right now. Halt! Hey, that's one a piece, ain't it? Well, the last one's mine. There's no sign of Donovan or Aguasanta. What about his sergeant? Not among the dead. The army's late as usual. Aguero was right about that. So there's no point in hanging around here, Lieutenant. We'll go to their campsite and represent that army cannon. That's right. Hold it. Where do you think you're going? I told you he was mine. You kill him, I'll take the bodies. Worth five thousand dollars. Always the money, eh? I appreciate it. Here. I wouldn't want you to die without your hat on. You're a forgiving bastard, ain't you? Yeah, it's amazing. The similarity between us. Donovan! Hey, Donovan! Donovan! Are you a bastard? you crazy? No! Donovan! Donovan! Ha ha ha! Dammit! Dammit! That thing'll blow me to pieces! That's right. It's the only way I can be sure of getting rid of you. Now, don't fret. It could happen to our miss and you'd be all right. Donovan! You're a rotten, lying, double-crossed and yellow-bellied son of a bitch! Well, I'll be. I can tell you had that bottle up all day. Like moving your bowels, ain't it? Well, I'm ready. If you got any last requests to make, you better make them fast. Oh, but don't ask me for a woman, a bandage over your eyes, or mercy, because I'm plumbing all three. Donovan! I swear I'll stick around to haunt you, you son of a bitch! You better start praying, Aguasala! You better start praying now, because it's all over! Donovan! DONOVAN! Halt! Look at it. Well, it seems like we're late again, but we've got the cannon back finally. But I can't bury a habitat. One volley salute, Lieutenant. One volley salute. Ready? Captain, sir, don't you know wasting ammunition is against regulation? Ah, big shit.
