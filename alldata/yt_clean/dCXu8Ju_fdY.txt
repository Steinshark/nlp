My brain's Hey, it's me, Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. We are right in the middle of a And you may recall in a previous video, we went to a progressive metal stamping They took coils of metal and they rolled and they would stamp It's an incredible process. But one of the challenges to a process of time and skill to create Today, we're going to Now, we're not going to get the same level progressive metal stamping, but we are parts quickly, like change the part, which developing something or making So today I'm super excited to continue the Smarter Every Day deep dive series into about something called The intricate details of how this process this stuff on the Internet, and I think So let's go get smarter every day and learn about incremental sheet forming, or [Guitar Riff intro song] So out in L. A. there's this company And after a little bit of back and forth on the intercom because people are rightly to a secure facility, they Oh, they opened it. Okay, we're in. He's the one that reached out after seeing He introduced me to a couple of his And then we headed upstairs to the office Ed and Boback, two of the Ed is the CEO and has an interesting the technology partnerships and has Both of these guys are astoundingly sharp. So my understanding is you guys have a way don't know how to say it, touching it Let me just draw it right here. So you guys have a plane of metal and you bring two tools in and you And depending on the position of this... What do you call these tools? [E] I call them end effectors, but forming styluses, but yeah, end effect [D] Okay, got it. and they put force right here, And if you do it in a certain way, I'm assuming the position of [E] Yes. [D] Okay, and so you can do things [E] Yeah, so I think the best analogy that I can think of, how a potter, you have a pinches the clay with their finger and That's what we're trying to do with sheet, requires thousands of Deformation with the pinch, it can There's a combination of different part that you want. geometries, but the trade-off is it takes It takes a little bit more time to make the part, but if you take into account the the part, then in a lot of cases, up to [D] Really? [E] Because you can start making the part With the mold, you have to go Usually, the design of the mold is also slightly different than Because the sheet has a spring back, you Your mold is usually different It's just not the negative By the time you're going through those iterations, you're spending hundreds of you get your part, you might be But then once you're forming the part, obviously, we're seconds you get your part. [D] This is great for development [E] Yes, I think that's the first But you would be surprised [D] it's further down the [E] it's further than the chain you think. [D] Ed took us downstairs to see the robots. But before you see it, I want This is not like these guys This is the result of decades of And in fact, if you look at the old patent history, you can see patents from Japan, People have been trying to figure this point where they can crack [E] Ford, Boeing, Nissan did some R&amp;D work in this, but nothing really [D] So you're running KUKAS? [E] We're running KUKAs at the moment. The robotic system is KUKAs, You can see on the other side, We are robot-agnostic. We pretty much basically build the whole scratch, so it's not dependent on [D] It's like a dance. Oh, that's amazing. It's different than I thought. It's actually pushing. Sorry, I'm being rude. [M] Mark. What's up, man? [D] Nice to meet you. Can I put a mic on you? [M] Sure. [D] Can you show me what's [M] Yeah. This is incremental forming. [D] Yes. Incremental metal forming? It's a two-millimeter aluminum sheet and there's one robot on each It's a lot like a potter's But here the tips are moving It doesn't have to be round. You can push any shape you want. Layer by layer, we're stretching and pinching and pulling whatever shape [D] The triangle here is coming out of plane. [D] Which means this one over here, are Aware of? [D] Can I. [M] Yep. [M] Just try not to get between You should be good. This one is pushing. [D] Do you have a force gage [M] Yeah, there's load cells on both robots, so you can feel exactly Here, you can see over This is the forces that both [D] Okay, so can you tell me [M] Yeah, there's the Z component, the in-plane component, and then [D] It's pretty easy to understand the force in-plane forces are the side-to-side [M] There's robot number one here is the one here is the support What you could do is you could do this just poke in metal and basically [D] But the boundary conditions. [M] Then you load the whole So what we're doing by having a support so you localize all the force just between sheet and makes it so you can [D] That's amazing. have a little visualization here This is just fabric on a sewing frame. If you push against this thing, This is going to deform. This doesn't behave like the metal does, Now, when people work with metal, they use locally deform the metal past They make a permanent deformation. What they're having to do in this case is were to push so hard that you It'd be really weird, right? So they're locally doing it by putting two just yielding it right there That's really hard to do when you have forces on both sides and So what they're talking about is wild have a rigid datum, and you bend over a They're moving things around, So one is pushing, so I would expect a positive force And this one, if it was just holding in one position, would you just from the other side so that you know [M] We get pretty fancy about it. Because should I talk Am I. [D] Well, should I let him do it since [E] No, I think Mark knows, yes. No, continue. [M] Yeah, really, there's control systems on both of these robots where we can That just is the theoretical They feel the forces, and we use that to update to make corrections [D] Continuous [M] Yeah. deflection under load because The other one is trying to hit a [D] In super simple terms, the first robot is supposed to get to a certain point in push at a certain force That's interesting, but the problem is force, the robot itself starts to bend, [E] You have two robots on a The envelope is 12 foot by five foot. Getting two industrial robots to be very we have to do through a lot of But then the moment they start touching These robots are pretty new, though. You can imagine every There are controls and mechanisms that so that the robot stays accurate Sometimes, depending on what sheet we are forming, it can be like 20,000 Newtons It's like as high as the weight of a truck on a very small end effector Under those loads, robots sometimes You want to pinch a sheet that's only two millimeters or half a millimeter, There's a control loop that uses the force figure out how it can stay accurate [D] You just blew my mind a little bit. There's a lot of math here. Is there a robot around this corner? [E] There's a robot, but it's not you can. Okay. there's many ways to arrive at [E] Yes. If I arrive at this point and apply 5,000 pounds in that direction, I'm going to I'm going to get a certain You have to also determine how you get there in order to [E] Yes. [D] When you have a robot like this with a lot location, but you can get there It's funny, but you see Think about it like this. If you've got 5,000 pounds of force that's there's not going to be any But if you think about that second the actuator will determine the amount And the same thing applies to that third forces eventually get transmitted If you think about how these actuators work, they're all made up And if you were to zoom in, you would find If you have a driving gear here, if it were to stop and reverse and go the other play between the gear teeth, and that Watch the robot draw this shape. Now think about how the motors change direction at different Now think about the loading that's happening in the robot arm It's a pretty complicated motion Backslash is also something you have to like this screw system here that's When you move one way and then the other, you've got to take into account Okay, so not only do we the actuators themselves, with the arms themselves. If you've been on a ladder and you've tried to drill something in really high of where you're at, but if you're up here and you line everything up, you don't out of it, all these So not only do you have the. Actuator movements. You have the rigidity of the arm itself. [E] There's two types of accuracy. Get the robot to one point, but then also while the forces are With the load, now there's an extra like, okay, the joint A1 not only need to be at 60.2 degrees, depending if at the end, the a 5,000-pound force, and including [D] That's hard. It's a fun thing that our [D] If this is at zero degrees and I'm pushing to set up the robot to get there, be set up? Because we have seven axes, there's unlimited ways to [D] What do you do? Do you pick a few things and this always has to be here? There's so many cool things. You can just choose, randomly choose, stiffness in certain direction You say, Okay, move the robot and the combination to apply the most You have a function to You can part of your kinematics, you can [D] You're a wicked smart dude. [D] This episode of Smart Every Day is private network that you can use You can get a ridiculous deal right Com/smarter. And then the reason you don't see it on because we're about to manufacture that While I start by getting this block down use NordVPN is to mask what I don't particularly want people looking over my shoulder when I'm trying to learn Sometimes those are political topics. Maybe they have something I'm wholeheartedly endorsing you using a virtual private network to Nordvpn is super easy to use. You can even connect to the internet There's over 5400 servers you The desktop app has a thing This protects from malicious sites, One account gives you protected access to the Internet for six different devices, You can see the URL is starting Com/smarter. plan specifically, and Go check that out. It's risk-free because Nord gives By the way, NordVPN has a no-logs policy. They don't collect, track, All right, so here it is. If you want to try this and support Smarter every day by supporting the Com/smarter like you see on Thanks for sticking around for that build. And thank you for considering supporting You know what's going on here, and I'm grateful that you would Okay, that's just all the robot. Now we have to think If we have a piece of metal and we push If we hold it at two locations and we push on it, it's going to deflect What happens if we're holding it here and You're not in the middle, You're going to get a different Let's go back. Piece of fabric here, right? It's one thing to do it for a beam. That's what's called an Civil engineers are really good at that. Think about a plane. It's way different. Planar deformation is hard. So if I were to push up in the middle of this thing, I were to get a deflection be different if I'm over here at the edge towards the edge than it It's hard to see this, but this is also account when you're doing What do you call it when if I were to take a sheet and I were to touch in the middle, Is that edge effects? [E] I think we call it boundary [D] That's what. [E] Yeah, but you're right. Boundary condition affects the We have a whole software stack You can imagine you form a Actually, the same robot [D] To do quality? [E] To figure out, yes, exact quality, or To update the model. Then it will be like, Okay, I formed this. These are the areas that were off. That means maybe I should have pushed more in some areas and pushed It can manually iterate on that or keep model that would tell you, Okay, in order the sheet, you need to actually In the end, you're going to actually get the right part with all these [D] You might over shoot Just like injection molding or something. All these processes have that. Because it's actually rolling, isn't it? This is a specific one does. There are other ones that we have [D] Like a ballpoint pen? [E] Yes, exactly. There's a sphere tip, there's a flat tip. Depending what effect you want to get out of the part, you might want [D] Different radii as well. If it's a sharp crease, different... [E] But that detects the smallest We've done a quarter-an-inch diameter I think these are what? Half quarters? Three-quarters-in-inch diameter? This one is just... I can't predict where it's going. Mark, you have a complicated program. Yeah, it's rolling along the [M] You can see at the corners where it changes wall angle where [D] At the corners, it changes? Right here at the bottom of the part, you'll see it comes out now [D] Oh, so I see. We're moving in the Z. [M] Yeah, this wall is steeper than this wall, The tip goes in and out there to basically keep the tips perpendicular to [D] I see. Even on any one slice, it's actually a [M] They're planar slices, but the tips move like this, depending on the [D] Oh, really? [M] We have some fancy if you want to talk about that. [E] Let me show you some of the You're forming on a curved section. You're not starting from a flat sheath, you're forming from a section Now your robot is actually going into a Another feature out of it. This is what's. [M] Yeah, we're doing the face and then this triangle is the one that's just This whole thing is about 90 minutes. Then it'll do this hexagon part. This one's actually a There's no... [M] It's a 1 millimeter pitch, but Then all of these are actually chained The robots will do one and they'll immediately go over and Slowing down or something. [D] That's interesting because when I looked going to do one plane and then just move But you don't have to do that. [M] We can do whatever we can imagine. Right here, there's a bit of a seam, if you look really closely, But if I do a spiral, then you [D] You transition, meaning you move up. [M] This one is just planer slices. You do one loop and then you step [D] Oh, I see. It's just a continuous going a. [D] Is it also faster? [M] I guess a little bit because Yeah, that one, it just [D] Can you tell me about This is an earlier version, right? [E] Yeah, so the.. [D] Can I stand here? The goal is really what we want to do is even though we are doing sheet forming, we call a robotic craftsman, a You can pick up a forming tool, form it, scan it, drop the scanner, You can see there's a spinel there. [D] Is that an ER-20 or something? The idea is you can easily change it. You can see a tool changer here that can drop a tool, pick up another tool, and That's the we're imagining these robots really working like a craftsman that can [D] Okay, so you're not pushing like, Oh, you're applying electrical contacts, [E] Yeah. Once you pick up, it automatically Now the robot now has the They can drop this, pick up the forming [D] You have indexing pins to align it, You have total indexing. Then what's going on here? [E] Those are actually the bearings that through air pressure, Once it picks up the slave, this thing and then lock into the tool [D] Oh That's amazing. What is this? You told me, but I forgot. These are pneumatic connections and [D] Got it. [E] Right now, we do mostly We do mechanical trimming. You can see that tool is in a spindle that allows us to cut the Then you have different versions That one doesn't have the final It does the forming. The one next to it, it does. [E] You can see that the end effector [D] Your tools, are they carbide [E] We tried a bunch of material. Right now, most of our tools But then on top of it, we have a coating. That coating is slightly more complicated. We have tried a bunch of different things. [E] Yes. That's a coating that basically allows us basically destroying the [D] It's a pretty simple tool, isn't it? That's the end effector is pretty simple. This is one of our designs. We have multiple designs. This is one of the design that [B] Then the coating, getting to that. [D] That's the secret sauce? [B] -that's-it took a while. Took a while. 7:00 PM, running to UPS, get this out. [E] Even though that's a secret sauce, it really also comes down For example, if you say get the robots and run them in just get the geometry, slice the final part is going to be inches off [D] Really? [E] You have to really account for We talked a little bit about deflection of itself, and then the fact If you don't have the right amount of compression force between We get to the fracture limit Combination of all those things are part that's going to be very close to That's, I think, where the real [D] When you get done with this thing, you're This is going to be a hood for a truck. It'll be done. out of that? [E] The same robot, after it's forming it, scans it, and It aligns the trimming path to the scan the best way, picks up a trimming You leave few tabs around the part and then technicians come in and cut But we want to make sure the robot at so that the part is.. [D] Before you remove it. [E] Before you remove it. Then you leave few tabs in and then you [D] If you had titanium, the SR-71, they didn't I saw the glimmer in [E] To this day, I don't think [D] Really? [E] I think it's just a very We figured out how to machine it, Unless you elevate temperatures and room temperature is really [D] But, Could you use this technology to form it [E] Yes. excited about that? [E] I think those are the areas Enabling alloys that were I think, for example, for Hypersonic, you said SR-71, but all the Hypersonic lot now with some of our customers, these aircrafts out of high temperature We're talking about refractory alloys. [D] Is this titanium? [E] We've already cut out the part from the customer cut out, but you can It's actually a pretty thin sheet. [D] This is all not part of the part, but this is like the form, I don't [E] We create enough stiffness around the part that as we are forming it, [D] Got it. Okay, because I'm pushing here. That makes sense. Because if I'm pushing right here, [E] Yes. The deeper it is, it [D] You just looked at me. [E] That's right. The deeper it gets, also you are more little bit of elastic deformation If you want to do a very shallow You're just going to push Once you go further deep, You can easily overcome the initial elasticity and get to [D] My brain's on fire. The rigidity of this support skirt around the part is key, and a keen observer will around the shop, it's not just a flat a wavy gusset because that's So if I'm looking at this sheet right here, is the material the thickest it And anytime I work, I'm having to Thinner here. [E] Yes. is that conservation of So as you're going on a higher wall angle, the cosine of your wall angle times the original thickness roughly gives In the part. explained a complicated The quickest way to explain restriking is shot, it'll make the side walls right But if you do it in two shots, first, you make a cone and you push that cone out, have more thickness on the If you want to learn more about how this we didn't talk about in this video, I've channel video where we just let the right into the weeds with us and It's fascinating. That was huge. [E] You can form parts faster than you could [D] That is such a big deal. [E] Yes. [D] A huge thanks to the folks at Machina Labs sheet forming, or as they It's a really cool thing, and I'm grateful that they helped us continue the Speaking of which, if you are interested manufacturing series, I'll leave a link in the video Com. It's really simple. Finally, I want to say thank you to This is such a fun thing I get to do. It's a lot of work, and the patrons This community of people is the driving actually having the I'm so grateful for everybody that contributes to Smarter If you would like to consider You can check that out at absolutely no pressure here, And we've had a good vibe Com/smartereveryday.
