The moment when you truly understand the value of the Ukrainian flag. September of the 24th year, another prisoner exchange. And for the first time since last year, the Azov fighters are on the list. Valerii, with the codename Yarylo, was one of them, endured the tortures of Donetsk's "Izolyatsia" torture chamber. He sat in the same cell with David "Khimik" and with a U.S. citizen. And also experienced what reincarnation feels like. The investigator's assistant says: &quot;put that one in the trunk, basically&quot; They shoot you in the head, blood starts flowing, the bullet grazes you. Well, there was still a bag on my head, then they put a plastic bag over it, strangled me with it. "That's enough, let's just shoot him," one of them says, but the other replies, "No, let's hang him instead&quot; - How did you meet Khimik in captivity? Were you in the same cell? - They tormented him there, beat him with a slipper. Then they would come in and say, "What, are you a masochist, are you an idiot? Don't want to sign? Do you actually enjoy us beating you?" They turned up the music. The song by Alla Borisovna "Take Me with You," but not in her performance - in some disgusting criminal version. "Oh, take me with you." It was honestly really unpleasant. They told me, "You ended up in hell." Valerii is one of the most charismatic heroes on this channel and will definitely give you a lot of motivation.

Two and a half years in captivity, the battle for Mariupol, so many events, probably enough for several lifetimes. If you were making a movie about yourself, where would you start? What's the most vivid memory that will stay with you forever? - The battles for Mariupol. The day we were moved to the city center. The next day, my life was literally hanging by a thread. An enemy bullet flew along my temple, cut off my headphone and the buckle of my helmet. After that, I was really shocked. - They shoot you in the head, blood flows, the bullet grazes you, and you feel like the gods are helping you. But these gods aren't the usual ones for us, not like in the Christian church, your own gods. Which gods? -Personally, I adhere to what some might call paganism, others might call native faith, and some might call synthaism. I have this feeling, the sense that my ancestors, our ancestors in general, always watch over me and help me every day. When I started studying at university, our history professor of Ukrainian and world history would come to class without a single paper, and tell everything from memory. He also increased my interest in the next question. In my perception, there was always just Christianity and nothing else. And I didn't realize that there were so-called pre-Christian times. And when I got to know history, I learned that our ancestors, before the Christianization of Rus and all of Europe, had their own religion, their own faith, their own culture, their own traditions. I'm the kind of person who always seeks the truth in matters that concern me, looking for the root of the issue. I realized that in fact, our native faith is our nature, essentially. Our nature, what surrounds us, and our ancestors are, essentially, our gods, whom we pray to, honor, and talk to, asking for help - In Christianity, dying is scary because you either end up in heaven or in hell. - Everyone ends up in hell. If you read the Bible carefully, everyone absolutely ends up in hell. - You don't need to make such clarifications for believers. In paganism, where do you go after death? - In pagan beliefs, warriors go to... If it's Germanic-Scandinavian mythology, then it's Valhalla. If it's Greece, then it's Elysium. Among the Slavs, there's something called Perun's regiment. That's where warriors go. Roughly speaking, if you draw a parallel, it's Valhalla In Azov, Yarilo joined an elite intelligence unit. Only the best were selected after numerous tests. But the main trial lay ahead: Mariupol, two and a half years in captivity. Your quote: &quot;The Azov fighters didn't think about captivity, I went to Mariupol to fight to the death.&quot; -About captivity, I think no one could ever even imagine it. Speaking for myself, when you join the service, you understand the consequences, but we could never think about captivity. And there was an interesting situation. We had a woman psychologist during our basic military training, her callsign was &quot;Psyche.&quot; She conducted our sessions, and we talked about captivity. She asked, &quot;Guys, tell me, if you're ever in a situation where you have to surrender, what would you do?&quot; Of course, everyone starts tearing their shirts, saying, &quot;I'll never surrender,&quot; others saying, &quot;I'll blow myself up with a grenade, what captivity?&quot; And she said, &quot;You're actually idiots because the state invests huge amounts in you. Your commanders invest knowledge in you. As a combat unit, speaking in materialistic or mercantile terms, a lot has been invested in you. Just dying and not returning, blowing yourself up with a grenade, doesn't take much brains. But to endure captivity, all the torture, humiliation, and return to your ranks, passing on your combat experience to the next generation, that deserves far more respect than simply ending your life.&quot; Some commanders tried to get permission from Redis to sneak out of the plant on their own and not surren der, but Redis said, &quot;Guys, I completely understand your desire, but we have a ton of wounded. If any of you tries to escape and someone notices, it will ruin the entire operation, and then everyone will die. The priority is to save the lives and health of our personnel and especially provide help to the wounded, who were already rotting without medication and painkillers, waiting in agony for rescue -Another question about Redis. What surprised you the most about him? People say he visited fighters in Mariupol even while bombs were falling in real-time. -Yes, that really happened. Personally, after I was wounded, I was lying in a bunker called Zalezya, which was like an underground hospital. There were a lot of critically wounded, with horrific scenes you'd only see in a World War II movie, and even then, you wouldn't believe it. Such a situation was unfolding at Zalezya, and Redis, risking his own life, visited the wounded despite constant airstrikes, Grad missiles, Tulip mortars --everything. Everything was flying in Mariupol. And yet Redis visited the fighters personally. I remember a moment when we were lying there, and suddenly Redis walks in, fully armored, and we were shocked, really shocked. Well, there was even some criticism about this because, damn, all the Mariupol garrisons were managed by one person--well, not exactly one, of course, there were many people involved. But still, everything relied heavily on Redis. If, God forbid, Commander Redis had been killed, I think everything would have fallen apart very quickly. -Did Redis go to negotiate with the Russians? Was there such an episode? -Yes, he personally went to negotiate with representatives of their armed forces and the GRU. He personally went to these negotiations. Many Azov fighters and commanders criticized this decision, fearing for his life, knowing that the Russians never keep their promises. They might say, &quot;Let's talk and negotiate,&quot; but the next second a sniper could take him out. There were many similar situations. For example, when a ceasefire was declared to let civilians leave the bunkers, and as soon as they began to exit, an anti-tank missile hit the vehicle with civilians. They were shocked that the person commanding the entire Mariupol defense would personally go to negotiate. This earned him a lot of respect and contributed significantly to our survival from the plant. Despite the hardships that followed in captivity, we still managed to save the lives and health of many fighters. -Now, what about UkrArmor? There's a lot to choose from. The best military footwear. Belleville, an American classic, with over a century of experience. Comfortable boots for the most demanding. Lowa, legendary and time-tested, worn in almost every military conflict over the past 100 years. And of course, Salomon, the brand used by French special forces. Not only high quality but also very durable. Salomon Tundra boots are ideal for the future. In autumn, they protect feet from the rain, water doesn't get through, plus the OrthoLite insoles with antibacterial properties keep your feet dry and odor-free. For winter, the Tundra boots are a perfect choice. They withstand temperatures down to minus 40 and protect against frostbite. An important detail is the anti-slip sole for maximum grip, even on ice. They joke that there's more technology in them than in Russian cars. Despite all their advantages, they are very light, only 675 grams each. Look for a bonus for my viewers in the description.

At 11, he joined a nationalist organization led by Andriy Biletsky at the time In the 2000s, the ultras movement developed significantly across Ukraine. We, as kids, were running around looking for all sorts of adventures. One of the members of the &quot;Patriot of Ukraine&quot; organization suddenly wrote to me in a private message, saying that they were a nationalist organization looking for young, athletic guys to join their ranks. If you're interested, come to our office on Rymarska Street, and we'll talk in more detail. - By 2006, Biletsky had already created Patriot of Ukraine. Now you understand that he was recruiting and preparing you. Was he already preparing for war back then? - This person realized that a similar situation, at least some clashes or conflicts, would arise in the future. Yes, I think that at that moment, he saw the prospects of a future war and was already training the youth, raising and educating them. How did Biletsky handle the conflicts for you? Was there such a story? - Well, it wasn't exactly Biletsky. While organizing my own football movement, I began to drift away from the Patriot of Ukraine organization. I acted unfairly by not informing anyone. The guys told me, let's meet and talk about why you stopped. So, I went to the meeting, leaving the older guys in the underground passage. I went alone, and saw about 10 guys coming toward me, looking a bit aggressive. What could I do against ten of them? The older ones noticed, ran out, and it turned into chaos, some brawling, but Krok and Andriy quickly intervened, calmed everyone down, and said they needed to talk to me. We went to the office, and a legendary guy named Stas Metro said he would come with me to make sure no one harmed me. They gave me a talking to, saying it wasn't right to leave without telling anyone, and that was the end of my involvement with the Patriot of Ukraine organization Azov has its own traditions, it's like the Cossacks. What can get you challenged to a duel in Azov? - For personal misunderstandings, perhaps. But calling someone to a duel isn't a gunfight; it's done with gloves in a ring, as it should be, with people making sure everything is proper. - Even if it's an officer, someone with a high rank, can you challenge them? - Technically, yes, but there must be respect for rank. Not every commander can be challenged by some young punk. - Okay, has anyone ever challenged Redis to the ring? - I haven't heard of anything like that. I doubt it's possible because, first, he commands immense respect among the fighters, and not just the fighters but now among all Ukrainians and the higher ranks of our army. Plus, he's got serious boxing skills, so I don't think anyone would dare challenge him. Also, Redis is much bigger than the average person in size and has serious boxing skills What can get you beaten with a stick? - Again, it's a tradition from the old days. It's no secret that similar punishments were practiced in Azov. The important thing is, when someone joins the unit, they know that there are such punishments. If you screw up, you'll pay for it. For example, if someone behaves inappropriately in town during their free time, drinks too much and starts a fight, they could get a beating, known as &quot;buky.&quot; The entire unit lines up, a bench is placed, and the person lies down on it. The commander administers the punishment. About Redis, people have been talking for a year about him as a future top commander. Some say it might happen one day. I've heard similar discussions about Biletsky at the highest levels before Syrskyi took the position. Who do you see in that role? - I associate Andriy Biletsky with Bohdan Khmelnytsky, while I associate our commander Redis more with Sahaidachny, because Redis, to me, is not a diplomat, but a military commander. In Mariupol, there were moments when the Russians felt so at ease that even high-ranking officers, like major generals, were there. Tell us about that operation. - I wasn't involved in that episode personally, but friends &quot;Bashnya&quot; and &quot;Indyets&quot; fought together. They were in the outskirts of Mariupol, hiding in bushes near a small grocery store. They saw a man come out, clearly a commander, with a large radio and a few others. They were surprised at how casually they walked out, not noticing the guys. The distance was about 20 meters, and they immediately opened fire, killing them all. When Indyets approached the general, who was dying, choking on his blood, he took the radio and a trophy PSM pistol from him In Mariupol, things changed quickly. One day, &quot;Yarylo&quot; destroyed a Russian tank and a lot of infantry, but by the end, he almost died himself. - The enemy started running in chaos, without covering each other, just fleeing from the building. First, 15-20 people ran out, and we opened fire. Then another 20 came out, and we fired again. Some fell, others managed to escape back into the 10-story building. It was a pitiful sight. You understand they are parasites, cockroaches, that need to be destroyed. At the same time, deep down, you almost feel sorry for them because they had no armor. They were just regular people--miners, teachers--sent to the front lines as cannon fodder. They had, well, Soviet helmets and all that. And you look at them and think, 'Guys, seriously, this gives you away.' - You mentioned before the interview that it felt like you had ended up in 1944. - Yeah, yeah, it really did. Again, because you look at these people who don't have any armor, wearing Soviet helmets. Sure, they had some serious guys with awesome gear, great weapons, and specialists, and so on. But first, we always threw the regular people into the front lines, just people sent as cannon fodder, trying to overwhelm us with numbers. How did you get wounded? - After we shot the groups coming out of the building, we realized it was time to clear it, as it seemed no one was left inside. We then heard a small sound, and at first didn't realize what it was. It became clear that a sniper had fired but missed. A second later, there was an explosion--a grenade launcher had fired at us, likely an RPG. I got hit by shrapnel in my left leg and arm, and another guy was also wounded. How serious were your injuries? - They were moderate, small shrapnel pieces hit my leg, near the calf, and one larger piece passed through soft tissue but didn't hit any arteries or bones. Some shrapnel also hit an intimate area, but luckily, nothing important was damaged. I was also very lucky--I had body armor with a kevlar chest protector attached to it, and on the chest protector, there was, well, a pouch. In that pouch, I placed a flag with the prayers of the Ukrainian nationalist. And one of the fragments hit directly into that flag, and it stopped it. Otherwise, it would have been a very unpleasant injury. It was right near the bladder. You understand, if the bladder is pierced, it's a pretty serious problem for the rest of your life Everyone saw that video of you being taken captive, how the Russians were checking you. There's also a video with the Khimik, where they asked him to show his tattoos. When you came face to face with them, what did they say to you? Because some people mentioned there were Russians who actually treated them with respect and said that they fought really well. Yes, I personally had a similar experience. At the point where they were searching us and checking our belongings, there was a soldier from the Russian Federation. He was going through my personal items. I saw that they took rations and other things from some people, but he didn't take anything from me. He left me my ration and water. He asked where I was from, and I said I was from Kharkiv. He said, 'Oh, nice city,' and so on. Then he asked, 'Where did you serve?' I said, 'In Defense intelligence.' He was like, 'Wow, impressive. That's the elite, right?' I said, 'Yeah, kind of.' By the way, he spoke to me in Russian, and I replied in Ukrainian. He didn't say anything about it and understood everything I was saying. And he actually said to me, 'You fought well, and I really respect you. Good luck to you and take care.' -You crossed paths with many well-known people in Kharkiv. One of them is now a legend--'Chili.' You were friends with him when you were kids. What do you remember about 'Chili'? Do you have any stories about him? We probably grew up together from around the age of ten, more or less in the same neighborhood. We went to nearby schools and had the same group of friends. We were always hanging out together. Chili always stood out as a leader. In whatever group he found himself, he always became the leader. It was just in his nature. He never smoked, drank, or did drugs. Not once. He never drank or smoked at all. And he was always into sports. The only thing, though, is he had one vice--he always drank Pepsi. Yeah, that was his thing. He used to guzzle Pepsi. There was even a joke once, during a conversation about how we'd like to die, and he said he'd like to drown in a river of Pepsi I'm not a big fan of alcohol either, but there are things that always bring pleasure. Like my favorite burgers at &quot;OKKO.&quot; And a little bit of revenge. I always fill up with the &quot;pulse of revenge&quot; at &quot;OKKO&quot; because one hryvnia from every liter goes toward Pulsatrons. These are highly effective complexes for the Air Assault Forces--reconnaissance and destruction complexes. And now, you're about to be pleasantly shocked. In five months of frontline service, the five Pulsatrons that &quot;OKKO&quot; and the &quot;Come Back Alive&quot; fund provided to the Air Assault Forces have already inflicted $200 million in damage to the enemy. During this period--just about six months--they have paid for themselves 33 times over. Pulsatrons in the hands of our paratroopers have destroyed dozens of tanks, IFVs, SPGs, and other costly enemy equipment. Now imagine what will happen when all 10 brigades get their Pulsatrons? Let's not imagine but take action. Fuel up with the pulse of revenge at &quot;OKKO&quot; or donate to the project's special account. The link is in the video description. Let's give the enemy an eye for an eye and equip all 10 brigades with Pulsatrons. Yarylo ended up in the same cell as David Khimik, but before that, there was real hell. The Donetsk prison &quot;Isolation,&quot; where torture of Ukrainians was known long before the invasion, and where people would occasionally just disappear. In 2021, the SBU arrested the chief torturer of &quot;Isolation&quot; in Kyiv, nicknamed Palich. Almost all the prisoners talked about him as the most brutal person they encountered in captivity. The trials dragged on for years, and in 2023, Palich started to retract his confessions of torture and really wanted to go to the front--to make amends -How did it happen that you went somewhere different from everyone else? Were you selected separately? -They started &quot;searching&quot; us before departure from Olenivka itself. Well, I kept a sort of diary at Olenivka for myself. I wrote various notes. And to practice my English, so as not to forget it, and so no one would understand what I was writing, I wrote these notes in English. I also had foreign phone numbers of my relatives abroad recorded there. And some of my own poems that I wrote at Olenivka. I hid some of these notes in the seams, in my pants, and elsewhere. When we approached the gates, their superior immediately said, &quot;Guys, if you have any notes or other stuff, better take them out now, because if they find them, it'll be worse.&quot; I stood there thinking, damn, alright. Carefully, so that he wouldn't see, I started taking them out, very carefully. He didn't notice. I took out one, then a second, a third piece of paper, and carefully put them into a secret pocket in my backpack. It seemed like I got rid of all the notes, but I forgot about a couple. And later, when they started to search me, their inspector found one note sewn into the seam. And damn, I stood there thinking, damn, I forgot about it. He took it out--it was all in English, plus the foreign phone numbers. He freaked out and said, &quot;What's this? Everything is in English. Where are our IT guys? Let them check these numbers.&quot; I realized some of these notes likely reached my investigator. Because when we talked, he said, &quot;Yeah, yeah, very good.&quot; I replied, &quot;Yes, yes.&quot; He hung up the phone and, talking to his assistant, he said, &quot;No, you'll go somewhere else.&quot; And I was sitting there thinking, what other place, what the hell. At the end of the interrogation at the prosecutor's office, I heard that all the guys were put into the prison van. I overheard someone mention they were being taken to Donetsk prison. But I was troubled by that phrase: &quot;this one will go somewhere else.&quot; They gave me the interrogation protocol to sign, and I read everything I had said. And when we were almost leaving, one of the inspectors, who transferred people, came in with a mask on--he was an ass--and said, &quot;What about this one?&quot; The other said, &quot;No, this one will go somewhere else.&quot; And the guy in the mask said, &quot;Seriously? Well, you're lucky,&quot; he told me. And I had this feeling, despite his vile mouth, that maybe, just maybe, higher forces were speaking through him, telling me that I was indeed lucky, and everything would be fine. He asked me, &quot;Need to pee?&quot; I said no. Earlier, I had overheard them talking about how one of our guys asked to go to the bathroom. And they said, &quot;Can you believe it? He asked to pee in the bathroom.&quot; And in the bathroom, they beat him with electric shocks to the genitals. I had experienced the same thing. When I went to the bathroom, I got hit with the electric shock, and when they asked me now, I said no, I didn't want to go. They took me outside, and I could hear that a prison van was already running. I knew the guys were inside. They led me with my head down, a bag on my head. The investigator's assistant said, &quot;Put him in the trunk.&quot; That was the last thing the guys in the van heard. They all thought I was a goner after that phrase. They thought because of my tattoos and everything else, that it was over for me. When I got into the car, one of them hugged me and said, &quot;How are you, Valerchik?&quot; I said, &quot;Fine.&quot; He asked, &quot;Do you know where you're going?&quot; I said, &quot;No.&quot; He said, &quot;Well, you signed everything, right?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;Then you're going.&quot; I sat there and started thinking, damn, am I the only fool who signed the papers they gave me, while all the other guys stood strong and didn't sign? Maybe that's why they're taking me somewhere unknown. They took me to, as I later found out, what others explained was the infamous &quot;Isolation&quot; plant in Donetsk. A torture chamber. The reception was unpleasant. They dumped me into what seemed like a garage or something. I had the bag on my head again. Then they put a plastic bag over my head, suffocated me, shocked me with electric prods, kicked me, and beat me. Then they dragged me down to a basement floor and continued. One of them said, &quot;That's enough. Let's shoot him.&quot; The other said, &quot;No, let's hang him.&quot; I was lying on the floor, thinking, finally, this will all end -You really thought that? -Yeah, I did. They had been torturing me for a long time, and I thought it would finally be over. Then one of them started suffocating me with the bag again, and I pretended to pass out. They took the bag off and said, &quot;No, let's hang him, let's shoot him, let's stab him.&quot; I realized they were just messing around and wouldn't do it for real. Then they threw me into a cell and one of them said, &quot;If you cooperate, everything will be fine, and you'll be exchanged soon. Someone will come to talk to you in a few days.&quot; Then the door slammed shut, and they yelled that I could take off the bag. I took it off and realized I was in a cell about a meter and a half square. Before that, I thought I had some claustrophobia, but... Well, as it turned out, I managed to overcome it pretty quickly. In just three minutes, I simply accepted the situation, and that was it. There was absolutely nothing in the cell except for a bucket, a bottle of water, and a camera that you had to keep l ooking at to show that you weren't sleeping. Sleeping was prohibited there. I was handcuffed to the door, to the lock. There were shackles on my legs. I spent almost a week there. They gave me a loaf of bread and water each day, and that was all. Every day, they took the bucket away, emptied it, and brought it back. And, of course, each day was accompanied by different conversations with you. - &quot;Isolation&quot; is such a horrible place that many people have talked about. Who managed to return from there? Not everyone made it back. Your first memories of being there -- you said they played some horrible music, like some kind of psychological pressure, certain phrases. How was it? - Yes, as soon as they took me in... It was like a garage or something. They brought me in and said, &quot;You bastard, you've entered hell!&quot; And then they started beating me. At that moment, they had some kind of music player there, and they blasted music. It was Alla Pugacheva's song *&quot;Take Me With You,&quot;* but not her version, some horrible criminal version. *&quot;Take me with you.&quot;* It was really unpleasant. They blasted the music so no one could hear the screams outside. That was unpleasant. They immediately started asking about my tattoos, and of course, they stripped me completely, asking about the tattoos. I have boxing gloves tattooed on my chest. &quot;Are you a boxer?&quot; they asked, and started testing how good a boxer I was. I said, &quot;I did Muay Thai.&quot; They immediately started hitting me with low kicks - What did they ask you about, what were they interested in? - The thing they're always most interested in is our salaries. This says a lot about what they need, what they actually care about. Because wherever you go, the first thing they ask you is how much your salary was in Azov. - Describe the cell. Was it small, dark? Captives often say there's nothing to do, so you start examining the walls. Were there any writings on the walls? - Yes, it wasn't dark, there were no windows, nothing. Just one lightbulb burning 24/7, and that was it. The only source of light, so to speak. And yes, there were these carved marks on the walls, you know, like in prisons where they draw those calendars. Four lines, then the fifth cuts across. Five days, five nights, five years, I don't know. There was a similar calendar there, one marked with 30 days, another with 50. I was sitting there on the first day, looking at it, thinking, damn, 50 days here, this is insane. But at the same time, some inner voice told me that I wouldn't be here for that long, that it would end a bit sooner for me. I just closed my eyes, turned away from the camera, and tried to recall every detail of my life. I literally tried to dive deep into my subconscious and consciousness, to remember moments like being in my mother's womb. I remembered books, some songs. There was even a snippet of Vladimir Vysotsky's song *&quot;I Don't Like&quot;* carved on the wall. That really gave me strength, it was inspiring. It goes like this: *&quot;I don't like myself when I'm a coward, and I can't stand it when the innocent are beaten. I don't like when people try to pry into my soul, especially when they spit in it.&quot;* That was truly inspiring. And there was another phrase someone had carved: *&quot;Everything passes, and this will too.&quot;* So, you just had to grit your teeth and endure it. That's all - In the cell, you also said you thought about reincarnation, that you felt like in a past life, you had already been in a similar situation. What was that like? - I closed my eyes, and suddenly, Ivan Franko's poem *&quot;Hymn&quot;* came to mind: *&quot;Eternal revolutionary. The spirit that tears the body into battle, striving for progress, happiness, and freedom. He is alive, he has not yet died. Neither the priests' tortures, nor the arresting tsarist walls, nor the disciplined army, nor the ready cannons, nor the spy's craft have yet sent him to the grave.&quot;* These lines, these words were so etched into my mind, and somehow, they surfaced from my subconscious at that moment. And then, in just a flash, for a split second, it seemed to me--maybe I was imagining things, maybe someone said something, I don't know. But something told me, a certain inner voice, that I had been through this before, and this time, I would get through it again. - Before the interview, you said a really great phrase that I remembered: &quot;I knew for sure that I would get out. I didn't believe because I believed in Santa Claus -- I knew.&quot; - That's absolutely true. I knew it would be a tough road, I would have to endure, but in my mind, everything that happens to us, I believe, happens for the better. Whatever happens to you, in my view, it's for the best. So, yes, people believe, as you said, they believe in Santa Claus, something they can't see, something they might not be sure of. But I knew from the very beginning that everything would be okay. Nowadays, there are stereotypes that paganism is barbarism. In fact, Christianity itself imposed this. What are some of the strangest myths you've heard about paganism? - I was interviewed in Horlivka by journalists from the First Channel. They wanted me to play along with their narrative and talk nonsense. They asked me what pagan rituals we performed in the bunkers of Azovstal. Whether we sacrificed cats, dogs, or even people. Just as I'm smiling now, I had the same reaction then. The journalist who was interviewing me got really worked up, practically foaming at the mouth. He wanted me to say that we sacrificed, but I didn't. Even under the threat of being beaten, which has happened before. They didn't touch me after that. I just told it like it was. When the cameras were off, he said to me: 'I'm an expert and a specialist in information wars, so I'll tell you this - you are totally brainwashed.' And I thought: 'Okay, dude, I'm brainwashed, but your head is full of crap.' - In captivity, they try to break people. How did you not waver? Because there's constant psychological pressure, they tell you you're a fascist, a murderer, an Azov member, that you raped grandmothers, and someone might start believing it because you hear it every day. When you end up in places like Isolation (a prison) or other places where you're beaten and tortured, it only strengthens your worldview. You understand that these are exactly the scum you're fighting against, the ones you're defending our women, children, and all Ukrainians from. But when you find yourself in a different situation, like I ended up in a pretty decent place where their inspectors treated us with respect, offering us candy sometimes - that's when doubt might creep in. When what seemed like scary orcs from Donbas are offering you chocolate or giving you sweet tea. Some other things I don't want to mention now, so I don't harm those people. That's when you might start doubting. You thought they were all goblins and orcs. But here's a reasonable person with a kind face treating you with respect, despite the difference in worldviews and positions. They still treat you respectfully, as a warrior, as a military man. If the Russians had actually used that tactic - treating prisoners of war with respect, giving them chocolate and the like - many of them could have truly wavered in their worldview. Because they might think, 'I was wrong, I thought they were terrible people, but here they are giving me chocolate.' You were in various places in captivity. Were there episodes where you were treated normally? This was still Ukrainian territory, but occupied. There, you really felt like a prisoner of war. Some places were more or less normal, bearable. I was lucky, really lucky. In one of the places I was held, we were treated well. There was even a TV in the cell. We got to shower every week, they allowed us to exercise. They fed us quite well. The food itself was bland, to put it mildly. What does the treatment depend on? I understand you were treated fairly, and speaking Ukrainian wasn't forbidden by some, right? Yes, it was true, I spoke Ukrainian for a long time, and some inspectors even replied to me in Ukrainian. Often, you could hear Donetsk inspectors complain, saying, 'The ones from Moscow will come and drive us crazy.' They fully understood everything. I think it mainly depends on the leadership of a particular colony, prison, or camp. Where the leadership is more reasonable, there are fewer beatings and torture. Where the boss is also irrational, the treatment is just as bad. How did you meet Khimik in captivity? Were you in the same cell? - Khimik was also at Isolation, but he was transferred to the next place before me. When I was transferred to another cell, I opened the door and saw Khimik standing there. At first, he didn't recognize me because I had a mustache and beard in Olenivka, but when I arrived there, I was completely shaved, bald, and much thinner. He didn't recognize me at first, but after we started talking, he realized it was me. We ended up spending two months in the same cell. On my birthday, he was taken for exchange with other guys who were there. - Did Khimik have problems at the start because he refused to sign the papers you mentioned? - He refused to sign anything for a long time while he was at Isolation, and they tortured him for it. They beat him with a &quot;tapik&quot;, among other things. But one day, they came to him and asked, 'Are you a masochist? Are you crazy? You don't want to sign? Do you enjoy being beaten?' He replied, 'I'm not going to sign nonsense.' Did the guards respect Khimik? - Yes, they treated him well and spoke to him normally, never a harsh word. I think they respected him, first of all, because he was from Mariupol and was defending his own city Secondly, they respected him even more after the exchange. When they talked to me, they said, 'The Khimik is a real hero. He didn't talk nonsense about being tortured or killed. He told it like it was - in one place, it was bad, but in another, it was okay. They treated me humanely, and no one hurt me.' - The guards were shocked that Khimik was an officer and had tattoos. - Yes, they were all shocked that, first of all, he became an officer at 25, and second, that he was covered in tattoos, with Baphomet across his back and Satan and all that. How could someone like that become an officer? For them, it was unthinkable. For example, I have a spider web tattoo on my arm. Many of the inspectors thought it was a junkie tattoo and asked if I was on drugs. In right-wing circles, a spider web on the elbow symbolizes loyalty - loyalty to one's principles and worldview. Here I have Perun and runes representing different elements. Which tattoo got you in the most trouble? - This was my first tattoo at age 17. It was during the events of Euromaidan. A few months before my birthday, I asked my dad to let me get a tattoo for my 18th. He reluctantly agreed after some tough arguments. But I didn't wait for my 18th and got it a few months earlier. The one I got the most trouble for was the coat of arms. How did they treat Redys? What did they ask about him? Since he's such a prominent figure, I imagine everyone was curious. - At Isolation, it wasn't just interrogations but also 'conversations with passion,' so to speak. One day, they were interrogating me, asking dumb questions, and one of them, I could tell from his tone, was genuinely curious. He asked about Redys, almost with a bit of respect, 'So, is your Redys really a great commander?' I said, 'Yes.' Then he asked, 'How old is he?' I told him 30. He said, 'And at 30, he became a major, the commander of the Mariupol garrison?' I said, 'Yes, he worked his way up from a grenadier soldier to commander. He rose through the ranks without nepotism or anything like that.' In the end, he said, 'Well, Redys is really something.' I thought, 'What do I say? If I agree, they might beat me. But whatever, I said, "Yes." And he said, "Yeah, he's really something." I was genuinely surprised - You had an African American cellmate, and you became good friends. How did that happen? How did he even end up there in the first place? - My birthday is on September 21, and on September 20, the guards came in and told Khimik to pack his stuff for exchange. So they took him and the other guys. Then an inspector came and asked if I minded having a new cellmate. I said, 'No problem.' A few minutes later, he opened the door, and there was an African. I knew there were foreigners in other cells and that one of them was African. His name was Suedi, last name Murakezi. He was from Rwanda but a true African American. We hit it off because we had similar worldviews. He practiced daily, had strict self-discipline, and followed intermittent fasting, eating once a day. He meditated, waking up at 3 AM. He was deeply interested in physics. His favorite physicist was Nikola Tesla. He also read Einstein and Newton. How did an American citizen end up in a Donetsk prison? - He stayed in Kherson even after the occupiers arrived and continued attending pro-Ukrainian rallies. Why did he care about Ukraine? Why did he risk so much? But no, he went to all the rallies with a Ukrainian flag. One day, while walking, a patrol stopped him and checked his phone. They found pictures with the Ukrainian flag and his service in the U.S. They said, 'Well, well,' and took him to a basement in Kherson where he was tortured. After Kherson, they transferred him to Isolation, where we were. He spent 50 days there on bread and water, no walks, locked in a tiny space. After that, he was moved to the same place we were, where we became friends&quot; Did they release him before you? - Yes, he was released at the end of November 2022. And as I thought it would be at least somewhat organized, that he would be picked up and deported, it turned out that the person just stayed in Donetsk for another six months, struggling and somehow surviving. In short, that's a completely different story, very interesting. By the way, speaking of racism, this person had cool Asics sneakers, a bit worn out. And during isolation, they took my combat boots and gave me these torn slippers, in which it was impossible not only to train but even to move around. Nevertheless, he said, &quot;Buddy, I'm going out, let's swap: I'll leave you my sneakers, and you give me these.&quot; I said, &quot;Don't start, you don't even know where they're taking you. Maybe to another prison, or somewhere else; winter is coming, and you'll be walking in these slippers.&quot; He insisted anyway, gave me his sneakers, and left his cool Columbia hat there. And that was it, he was taken away. I hoped they would send him somewhere organized, to the United States or at least back to Ukraine. But as I found out after I got out of captivity, we called each other, and he's now in Africa. He told me, &quot;Dude, I've been in Donetsk for half a year, just hustling as best I could.&quot; He had his own cryptocurrency account. He remembered the email and password. He accessed the account and converted the crypto to rubles. He found someone to whom he transferred this crypto, and that person gave him cash in rubles. He used that ruble to rent an apartment and buy some food. He was also trying to contact the U.S. and Ukrainian embassies. As far as I understood, one of the ministers, at that time the Minister of Foreign Affairs, helped organize his deportation. After six months, they took him from Rostov to America. How many poems did you write in captivity? I know you also love doing that. You wrote them on toilet paper, on wrappers, right? - Just regular, the cheapest toilet paper, but we had nothing to write on. We had no stationery, no pencils, nothing. We took aluminum wire from that light bulb that wasn't working, from the wires. We bent this aluminum wire and used it to write on these scraps of paper. Or on the walls, carefully, in tiny letters so that it wouldn't be noticeable in the cell. In this way, I wrote a column or a line, memorized it, thought about it, remembered it, revised it, erased it. And so I wrote poems for almost two and a half years of captivity, totaling 40 poems. Some of your poems might be found by an occupier in his clothing. - Yes, yes. Will you leave a hint? - Yes. There was one guy, I won't name him. By the way, when they transported us from one place to another, they showed a bit of... generosity, or something. They stopped at a gas station and bought a whole bag of those small &quot;Jack&quot; chocolate wafers and handed them out to each of us. It was really nice. But this guy, well, maybe from a poor family, I don't know, took my Asics sneakers that Suedi gifted me and gave me ordinary rubber slippers, like some that you'd buy for 20 hryvnias at the market. Before they transferred me from my previous location to another, I made a small cut in the tongue of my boot with a blade and stuffed some of my poems in there. So this person might find my poems one day. In those cells, people just go crazy. I listened to you; you said you were teaching English there, and you were learning Polish. Tell me how you managed to stay positive and improve yourselves even in such conditions? Despite the difficult circumstances we were in, we never allowed ourselves to wallow in despair or worry. I taught the guys English for two years. They really improved their level. Another guy lived in Poland for a long time; he taught us Polish. We learned a bit. We told each other about movies and books. Both in Ukrainian and English. On the eve of Christmas and New Year, I retold the guys the first and second parts of Home Alone with Macaulay Culkin in English. This guy who knew Polish told us the whole game of Thrones from beginning to end in Polish. So we developed as best we could. We didn't have any stationery or anything. We made do. In some places, there were traces of whitewash; we broke them off, and they were like chalk. We wrote the rules of English or Polish with that chalk. - You had a period of real hunger, when they starved you, and you lost 10-20 kilograms. There was one decent cook during your entire time there; there's an interesting story about that too? - There was one good guy; he often gave us extra portions. Later, when we learned from a conversation between him and another inmate, we found out that he was actually serving time for killing another Russian. We started to joke that this guy was one of us. The story goes that he was in a trench on the front line after February 24, 2022. They had been drinking with a friend, had a falling out, and he killed him. So it turns out our guy was giving us extra portions, and there's also this story How were you exchanged from captivity? Because the Azov fighters were hardly exchanged for a long time. I know there were many interesting signs involved. - For example, the day before I was taken to headquarters, they asked me if I wanted to be exchanged. We were standing there in the barracks, in a local area. We had a kind of entertainment program. We stood there singing songs all day long, just like Katyusha and others. So we're standing, singing, and I see on the fence, where the barbed wire is, two doves sitting, a male and a female, kissing each other. I looked at that and understood that it was a good sign, but I didn't want to say anything to avoid, so to speak, jinxing it. My comrade standing next to me, Seryoga Budikov, says, &quot;Valerchik, that's a good sign; for sure, you'll be going home soon.&quot; I thought, &quot;Well, yes, yes.&quot; The next day, they called me to headquarters and asked if I wanted to be exchanged. I said, &quot;Of course, I want to.&quot; And that was it; I was sent away. - You were exchanged on Friday the 13th. - A torrential downpour, thunder. Perun was throwing his lightning. I said it would be cool if I were exchanged on Friday the 13th. So, what do you think? We were making the beds, going for breakfast. I see the guys being led from my unit, all dressed in pixel uniforms, and one guy, who worked at headquarters, runs up shouting my last name, Horishniy. I thought, &quot;No way, really?&quot; Then we were transferred to the so-called transfer cell. Despite the fact that it was raining on Friday the 13th, everything else, a big black cat comes in and starts purring and rubbing against each of us. We petted and fussed over him. We waited, and then Voronok came and took us away for the exchange. We wrote about Ukrainian captive Oleksiy Anulya, who had such a great story that on New Year's, he felt he would be exchanged soon, and he had the melody of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; playing in his head. When you arrived in Ukraine, was there something playing in your soul? - Yes. While in captivity, I really wanted to listen to this song. The band Grits, an American group, has a song called &quot;My Life Be Like...&quot; For me, it was an emotional rollercoaster, you know? It sings &quot;My life be like...,&quot; meaning &quot;My life is like this.&quot; It's like, &quot;U-u-u-u-a-a-a-a-a-u.&quot; You know, it's ups and downs, ups and downs. The first song I listened to was this one. It really played in my soul at that time - You said that when you arrived in Ukraine, one song was also in your thoughts. This is a Ukrainian band that I also love. &quot;Kurhan i Ahrehat.&quot; By the way, I soon listened to this band's song. It's called &quot;How at Home, ***.&quot; It's just an amazing song. First of all, the lyrics are simple, understandable for everyone, but really very soulful. It's in that simplicity, in rural life, that I think there is a certain happiness. I also really want to live in the village. And on top of that, the guys are from Kharkiv region, from the village of Blyzniuky. I'm from Kharkiv myself, so, of course, it has a special meaning for me that the guys are from my homeland, my fellow countrymen. My name is Serhiy Peichev; this is the Pressing channel.
