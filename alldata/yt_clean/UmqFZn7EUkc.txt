A Long Time Ago, Beyond A Galaxy Far, Far [Music] Star Wars: Mist Encounter, 1995. By Timothy Zahn. A short story, which was originally published This is the Origins Tale of Mitth'raw'nuruodo. Created and Read by: The Archivist Publishing PRELUDE All beings begin their lives with hopes and Among these aspirations is the to those goals. It is seldom so. Perhaps never. A life path may change because of important Those were what drove my current path. But sometimes the smallest events can also mandated by outside forces. It was so with me. The memory is vivid, unsullied by age: the from their chairs as I am escorted into the The decision of the Ascendancy has been made, None of them is happy with the decision. I can read that in their faces. But they are will carry out their orders. Protocol alone The word is as I expected. Exile. The planet has already been chosen. The Aristocra will assemble the equipment quickly become death from predators or the I am led away. Once again, my path has turned. Where it will lead, I cannot say. TRANSITION The last two jumps had been marginal, skating space and even a little bit past it. The theory, at least as far as Booster Terrik's no commander would be crazy enough to risk smuggler into uncharted territory. So far, the theory hadn't worked. Maybe third time would be the lucky charm Or maybe third time would bring the Starwayman all over a planetary-sized mass. There were reasons why jumping blind into idea. [BORLOVIAN: &quot;Destination reached in 5 seconds, Prepare to enter Real Space in: Three - Two Now.&quot;] Beside Terrik, his Borlovian partner Llollulion &quot;Yeah, okay,&quot; Terrik said, getting a grip on the hyperdrive star system and its unknown planetary-sized &quot;Let's see if maybe they were smart enough He pushed the levers forward, and the mottled then into a starry sky. Directly ahead, the system's star was a tiny Bracing himself, Terrik peered into the aft And with a flicker of pseudo-motion, the Star Terrik sighed, too exhausted even to swear. So that was that. He couldn't lose the Star Destroyer, he couldn't outfight it. The options had squeezed down to surrendering, He could only hope that the latter option was interested in. Llollulion gave a sudden three-tiered warble. [BORLOVIAN: &quot;The Eternal Winds have granted Not only are we still living, but there is &quot;You're kidding,&quot; &quot;Where?&quot; Llollulion pointed out the canopy to the right It was a planet, all right: full-sized, close its fuzzy edge evidence of a reasonably thick And it was barely ten minutes full-throttle [BORLOVIAN: &quot;Fly like the Winds, my featherless We have a chance now.&quot;] Llollulion warbled again. &quot;You got it, partner,&quot; engines and turning the Starwayman hard to They couldn't escape, outrun, or outfight Maybe they could hide from them. TRANSITION &quot;Target has changed course, Captain,&quot; &quot;They're making a run for that planet.&quot; &quot;Acknowledged,&quot; as he watched their quarry driving hard for Of course, the smugglers were making for the He'd anticipated this move from the moment and had already given orders to counter it. Orders which inexplicably had not yet been &quot;Lieutenant, what's keeping those TIE fighters?&quot; Officer. &quot;Hangar Bay Control reports they're having sir,&quot; &quot;They have two free, but the rest -- &quot; &quot;They have two free?&quot; Parck cut him off. &quot;What are they waiting for? Launch them!&quot; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Parck stalked down the walkway, swearing viciously Between sky-headed techs who insisted on continually rule-bound officers who didn't have the brains when necessary, the entire Fleet was sliding But that would be changing soon. Barely a week earlier the news had reached declared himself Emperor of the newly restructured to taking charge of this mess. Some of the ranking officers of the Fleet about the whole situation; for himself, Parck politics would soon whip things into shape. A movement off the starboard bow caught his out in their belated pursuit of the smugglers. He looked back at the quarry ship, did a rapid &quot;Tell Hangar Bay Control to get the rest of he ordered the Comm. Officer. &quot;The quarry is going to make it down before We're going to have to smoke them out.&quot; But smoke them out he would. That ship was carrying cargo he suspected groups that had been springing up lately in The location of that group would be a fine he and the Strikefast had not come all the that prize. TRANSITION They were into the upper atmosphere, and looking began picking up the power emanations. &quot;Uh-oh,&quot; the display as he fought the controls against It was a power source, all right, sitting forest a quarter of the way to the planetary &quot;Not good. Double not good.&quot; Llollulion multi-warbled a question. [BORLOVIAN: &quot;Why is this 'not good'? There Imperial primates have no friends this The Winds may have granted us assistance!&quot;] &quot;Because it's just the right size for a small-base Terrik told him. &quot;Out here in the middle of nowhere, that means Or maybe even a small Fleet exploratory outpost. Regardless, it's no one who's going to be Still ... Terrik bit thoughtfully at his lip. Those two fighters behind them were getting to ground right now they would be able to could shut everything down. But if he ran past that other power source the pursuers' sensors just enough to let him It was worth a try, anyway. &quot;Hang on; I'm changing course,&quot; into a flat sideways slip. &quot;You got the triad on line yet?&quot; [BORLOVIAN: &quot;Of course I do, you over muscled Did you forget who paid for this ship? The triad is powered up and ready!&quot;] The Borlovian warbled an affirmative. &quot;Okay,&quot; &quot;Soon as those fighters get in range, see They had reached the forest and were flying up with the Starwayman's laser triad; and it was quickly apparent that the pursuing in atmospheric combat training. [Sounds of laser fire as space battle ensues] A half dozen exchanges of intense laser fire, and Llollulion warbled a seven-tiered whistle [BORLOVIAN: &quot;The Winds have gifted me with primate can avoid my wrath!&quot;] &quot;Yeah, great,&quot; Terrik growled, feeling a drop of sweat roll One of the TIE fighters was already a blazing and the other was spinning out of control downward toward the same oblivion. But the Starwayman had taken some damage, source dead ahead. The inhabitants there were surely alerted If they weren't interested in receiving company the trees with a tremendous crash; and an over a small clearing. Terrik caught a glimpse of a single small shed on one side and a pair of large metallic And then they were past, over forest again cliffs in the near distance. [BORLOVIAN: &quot;Look! In the clearing ... are those mini-shield Maybe we have found allies to assist us?&quot;] Llollulion warbled urgently - &quot;Give me a second, will you?&quot; Terrik growled back, throwing the Starwayman &quot;I didn't forget we're going to ground. What, you want me to land right next to that [BORLOVIAN: &quot;Why does this half-blind, featherless Let's run away from the help so clearly granted Llollulion subsided, grumping audibly to himself. But Terrik didn't care. The trick had worked -- maybe -- and that The Starwayman was in one of the cliffside before the next wave of TIE fighters went TRANSITION &quot;This is not,&quot; Mosh Barris's ears, You absolutely sure about this?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; boxes that stood beside the house they'd found &quot;The markings on the power generators alone has never seen anything like them." &quot;That doesn't necessarily prove anything,&quot; &quot;These nearer edges of Unknown Space have or smuggler. This could easily be the home or retreat of to pick up a couple of souvenirs along his &quot;That's possible, sir,&quot; &quot;But I think it unlikely. The buildings themselves appear to have been fair number of the contents are also of unknown My guess is that we're looking at the survivor &quot;Who then wandered off somewhere and died,&quot; &quot;Or else ran when he heard us coming,&quot; &quot;We can't tell how long the place has been Either way, we're stuck with the fact that There was the faint hiss of a sigh in Barris's A sigh, and the hint of a curse beneath it. &quot;And therefore, stuck with the UAE Orders.&quot; &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; curse. The Unknown Alien Encounters section of the days of the Republic, when a new alien species the Senate was falling over itself in its at every shaggy or lumpy creature a Dreadnaught The modern Fleet had no business handling so, and the High Command had repeatedly said Barris had heard rumours that Emperor Palpatine the burden of the outmoded contact orders But for the moment they were still on the them. Which meant there was nothing to do but obey &quot;Very well,&quot; &quot;Looks like you're going to be spending at your men make themselves comfortable. I'll have a tech analysis team put together Keep an eye out in case your castaway comes &quot;We will,&quot; &quot;What about the smugglers?&quot; &quot;The TIE fighters are still looking for them,&quot; &quot;If they haven't spotted the ship by the time search.&quot; &quot;Colonel Barris?&quot; an anxious voice cut in on the circuit. &quot;This is Lieutenant Kavren at the TIE fighter Sorry to interrupt, sir, but I really think Barris frowned across the clearing, to where be seen illuminating the tendrils of evening trees. He wouldn't have pegged Kavren for the excitable in the man's voice. &quot;I'll be right there,&quot; &quot;With your permission Captain?&quot; &quot;Go ahead, Colonel,&quot; &quot;We'll talk later.&quot; The reflection of the lights from the mist more than a three-minute walk from the edge the TIE fighter had blazed to the ground and A few more seconds in the air, Barris thought left of the alien encampment for them to study. Pity. Kavren and four troopers were waiting as Barris The lieutenant's back was unnaturally stiff; brims of their black helmets. Lying in the grass at their feet was the limp burned and torn. &quot;We found it right here, Colonel,&quot; suit. &quot;Several meters away from the main wreckage. Take a look.&quot; Barris lowered himself to one knee beside The helmet had been loosened from the neck opened. And the flight suit stuffed with - &quot;What in blazes?&quot; &quot;It's grass, sir,&quot; voice. &quot;Grass, leaves, and a lot of those funny-smelling And that's all. The body's gone.&quot; Parck looked around him at the trees and the the light breeze, a sinking feeling in the &quot;Have you looked for him?&quot; &quot;Not yet, sir,&quot; &quot;I thought it would be better to alert you If there are savages in the area ... &quot; He didn't finish the sentence, but he didn't Like most officers of the Fleet, Barris had &quot;Major Wyan?&quot; up. &quot;This is Colonel Barris.&quot; &quot;Yes, Colonel,&quot; &quot;I want a troop perimeter set up around the Barris ordered. Something off to the side at the base of a a closer look. It was the TIE fighter's survival pack, torn &quot;We've got native savages out here.&quot; &quot;Understood,&quot; He'd had experience with native savages, too. &quot;There's a troop carrier almost ready to leave put another squad of troopers aboard.&quot; &quot;Better make it a platoon,&quot; survival pack and pulling it open. &quot;Looks like they've made off with the pilot's grenades.&quot; &quot;Terrific,&quot; &quot;Primitives with weapons. Just what we need.&quot; &quot;Maybe they'll be considerate enough to blow Barris said, picking up the pack and standing &quot;We can always hope, sir,&quot; &quot;I'll get the security procedures started &quot;Good. Barris out.&quot; Barris stepped back over to the knot of troopers &quot;I want the flight suit and its contents taken Then take some troopers and start searching I want the pilot's body found.&quot; TRANSITION &quot;Sir,&quot; table and stiffening briefly in salute. &quot;The security perimeter is in place.&quot; &quot;Good,&quot; of the transparent weather canopy at the sky. About time, too. Full night was here, and with nightfall inevitably Not to mention unfriendly natives. &quot;Any news from the search team?&quot; &quot;Still no sign of the pilot's body,&quot; &quot;They've found a lot of bits and pieces from like animals had been at it. Maybe our primitives just tore the thing apart &quot;Maybe,&quot; &quot;But until we actually find that blaster, pointing it at us.&quot; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Wyan gestured at the table. &quot;So that's what was in the flight suit?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; of plant life spread across the examination it. An odd aroma permeated the air, probably from &quot;So far it seems to be just local grass and Some kind of religious ritual, maybe -- &quot; And without warning, there was the flash and &quot;Cover!&quot; Barris shouted, spinning around and dropping Halfway to the edge of the clearing a patch of the explosion; beyond it, troopers were line, blasters drawn and ready. Someone flicked a searchlight on behind Barris, and lighting up the thickening tendrils of Barris followed the spot of light with his to glimpse the enemy who was attacking them explosion came from practically right behind &quot;Colonel!&quot; his ears. &quot;I'm all right,&quot; stomach. A masterfully direct hit: the collection of was burning brilliantly, the table itself On the ground behind it, the two techs were squeeze themselves into the grass. The general comlink channel had come alive Barris kept out of it, staying where he was explosion. But the inevitable failed to happen. &quot;All perimeter troopers have checked in,&quot; to Barris's side. &quot;They're doing a complete search of the first nothing. Whoever they were, they seem to have gone.&quot; &quot;Considering no one apparently saw anything anything now is not a lot of comfort,&quot; feet and brushing himself off with his free &quot;It's getting pretty misty out there,&quot; &quot;Makes for poor visibility.&quot; &quot;Our natives don't seem to be having any trouble Barris said pointedly. &quot;What in blazes were those blasts, anyway? They weren't powerful enough to be concussion &quot;I agree, sir,&quot; &quot;My guess is they were blaster power packs An odd feeling shivered down Barris's back. &quot;That doesn't sound like something savages he said. &quot;I know,&quot; &quot;You suppose our alien has come back?&quot; Barris stared out into the darkness of the &quot;Or else our smugglers have.&quot; &quot;Hmm,&quot; &quot;Trying to scare us away, you think?&quot; &quot;Or else trying to get us running in circles.&quot; Barris keyed his helmet comlink for long-range. &quot;Strikefast, this is Colonel Barris.&quot; &quot;Captain Parck here,&quot; &quot;What's happening down there?&quot; &quot;We were attacked,&quot; &quot;Two explosions in the encampment, neither &quot;The attackers?&quot; &quot;No sign of them so far. We're still searching.&quot; &quot;Maybe they lobbed the explosives in from Parck said. &quot;I'll have a wing of TIE fighters do a flyover. Stand by.&quot; Barris keyed off and stepped back to the examination Yes; some sort of powerful catapult, fired That would explain why no one had spotted He stopped, looking up at the strips of shredded No, that didn't work. Anything coming in from above would have had table. It couldn't have done that without him hearing Could it? Something moved at the edge of Barris's eye. He twitched his blaster around, but it was the clearing. &quot;Major Wyan?&quot; &quot;Yes, Colonel?&quot; Wyan said, stepping around the nose of the &quot;Get some floodlights set up,&quot; &quot;I want the whole rim of the forest lit up should help burn off some of this mist, too. Also, fine-mesh the hemisphere sensor screen. I don't want any more explosives getting through Wyan's reply was lost in the sudden roar as level. &quot;I wa--&quot; &quot;What?&quot; Barris asked. &quot;I was pointing out that there are a lot of Wyan repeated. &quot;Small ground animals, too - I nearly twisted If we fine mesh the screen too far down, we'll Barris grimaced; but the major was right. &quot;All right, then, forget the fine-meshing,&quot; &quot;Just get those lights -- &quot; And suddenly, directly ahead, the nearest out of the forest in the distance. &quot;What the--?&quot; Wyan barked. &quot;TIE crash!&quot; Barris snapped, viciously keying his comlink. &quot;Crash team to the troop carrier -- now!&quot; He had keyed off the comlink, and was just of the crash rolled across the encampment. TRANSITION &quot;You have no idea what brought it down?&quot; Parck's voice asked in Barris's ears. &quot;Not yet, sir,&quot; anger. &quot;The crash team just got back with the fighter's And the pilot's body.&quot; Parck rumbled something under his breath. &quot;At least you got there before the natives &quot;No, sir, they didn't get the body,&quot; &quot;But they did have time to ransack his survival The crash team found it torn open and the time.&quot; &quot;And no sign of the blaster, power packs, &quot;No, sir.&quot; For a long moment there was silence on the the encampment at the forest. The floodlights he'd ordered had been set in brilliance. Insects and night avians swarmed and buzzed artificial daylight, the larger ones throwing &quot;You're the man on the scene, Colonel,&quot; &quot;But in my opinion, this has gone way beyond Are you certain the smugglers aren't involved?&quot; &quot;I've been wondering that myself, Captain,&quot; &quot;It could be there's something nearby they us down here.&quot; &quot;That might explain the attacks themselves,&quot; &quot;What about the flight suit stuffed with grass?&quot; &quot;Probably a feint,&quot; &quot;Something to convince us we were only dealing &quot;Unless we're dealing with both the smugglers Parck suggested. &quot;That might -- just a minute,&quot; he interrupted himself. &quot;Colonel, did you examine the flight suit &quot;I -- &quot; &quot;Now that you mention it, sir, I don't think We were more interested in the -- &quot; &quot;Go look at it now,&quot; &quot;Specifically, check whether or not the comlink It took a couple of minutes to find where It took ten seconds more to confirm that the &quot;Clever little snakes,&quot; news. &quot;One might even say inspired. What about the second flight suit, the one &quot;It's being checked now,&quot; Wyan and one of the troopers were going over &quot;Major?&quot; &quot;The comlink's still here,&quot; &quot;They must not have had time to remove it.&quot; &quot;Or decided not to bother,&quot; &quot;They could already eavesdrop on our communications.&quot; &quot;Not for long they can't,&quot; &quot;I've ordered the circuit that comlink is &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Bad enough that the smugglers had gotten away But to have his commanding officer be the &quot;They must still be in the area. I'll get some patrols organized and try to &quot;There's no rush, Colonel,&quot; &quot;As a matter of fact, I'd rather you stay Your sensors are going to be of limited use your men to ambush in the darkness.&quot; &quot;As you wish, Captain,&quot; &quot;Good,&quot; &quot;We'll speak further in the morning. Good night, Colonel. Stay alert.&quot; &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; &quot;Good night, Captain.&quot; He jabbed the comlink off. &quot;Doesn't sound to me like the Captain has Major Wyan said, coming up beside him. &quot;Can you blame him?&quot; Barris retorted. &quot;Under the circumstances, I suppose not,&quot; &quot;What now?&quot; &quot;We make our smuggler friends very sorry indeed Barris growled. &quot;First thing I want you to do is double-check anything else getting through tonight.&quot; &quot;Yes, sir. And after that?&quot; Barris looked out at the brightly lit forest, in his stomach. No smuggler was going to make a fool of him. Or if he did, he wasn't going to live to gloat &quot;After that, you and I are going to sit down tracking data from the Strikefast, and anything And we're going to figure out how to find TRANSITION Almost inaudible over the busy insect twitterings, cool night breeze. Terrik paused in his work, cocking an ear hard. It was the fourth such explosion in the past aircraft crash just after sundown. None of the blasts had sounded any closer It was the Imperials, of course. But what in space were they playing at? A shadow moved silently against the starlight Reflexively, Terrik reached for his blaster; &quot;You see anything?&quot; [BORLOVIAN: &quot;Still nothing in sight. As I have told you multiple times, even the too deeply through this mist. But - by the Winds - I will see any Imperial The Borlovian's five-tiered whistle was equally times. &quot;You know, this doesn't make any sense at Terrik complained, walking over to his partner's below. &quot;There aren't nearly enough explosions for But there are too many for it to be nervous shadows.&quot; For a long minute there was just the sound Terrik strained his ears, but there were no And then, almost diffidently, Llollulion made [BORLOVIAN: &quot;Have you considered going back That structure may only be the entrance to solace for us, my featherless friend.&quot;] &quot;Oh, come on, &quot; &quot;That was definitely a one-man house - two-man Who in the galaxy would be crazy enough to Imperials by himself?&quot; Still, now that he thought about it, the sound or less from the direction of the settlement And the power emanations they'd picked up So, who in the galaxy would be crazy enough [BORLOVIAN: &quot;Even a couple of Crintlians would They, at least, don't always choose to flee...&quot;] Llollulion warbled again. &quot;Okay, so a pair of Crintlians might take Terrik growled. &quot;Don't try to tell me it would take the Imperials Another dull explosion drifted in on the breeze. &quot;Five grenades,&quot; &quot;Anyway, it's none of our business.&quot; Llollulion gave a six-tiered whistle. [BORLOVIAN: &quot;Whoever is there is there is By the Winds - if they are fighting our enemies, Let's make it our business!&quot;] &quot;I said it's none of our business,&quot; &quot;You want to dodge a couple squads of Imperial there, be my guest. Me, I'm going to stay right here.&quot; The Borlovian reared his head back in surprise, &quot;Don't look at me like that,&quot; &quot;I have nothing against picking up allies Only this time, it doesn't. We're in Unknown Space, remember? Odds are this is some unknown alien we wouldn't And even if we could, who says he'd even want Terrik spun around and headed back toward &quot;Besides,&quot; &quot;all we really want from an ally right now And he's already doing that. Let's leave well enough alone, and get this TRANSITION They had five casualties among the sentry Three of them had died by the hand of the apart by concussion grenades. No one had seen anything, either before the The other two casualties had been accidentally mistaken them for intruders in the misty darkness. And by the time dawn began to lighten the &quot;I suggest you try to calm yourself, Colonel,&quot; &quot;I know it's been a bad night for you --&quot; &quot;Sir, I've lost five men tonight,&quot; It wasn't the most politic way to speak to especially politic at the moment. &quot;That doesn't even count the three TIE pilots I strongly recommend we abandon this site And that we then burn the entire forest down &quot;You're tired, Colonel,&quot; His voice was still calm, but it suddenly &quot;You're also not thinking straight. Killing the smugglers won't get us the location You think a burned-out freighter will be an Palpatine?&quot; &quot;I'm not interested in prizes, Captain,&quot; &quot;I'm interested in not wasting any more of &quot;You won't have to,&quot; &quot;A troop carrier is on its way down with two They'll be relieving your troopers.&quot; &quot;They've already arrived,&quot; to where the last of the faceless, white-armored forest. Their unasked-for presence was a blatant insult the moment, Barris didn't care about that, &quot;And if you want my opinion, sir, they're the smugglers than my troopers did. Smoking them out from orbit is our best option.&quot; &quot;I'll keep your recommendation in mind, Colonel,&quot; &quot;In the meantime, I suggest you get some rest. The stormtroopers can handle things from here And without warning, Parck's voice dissolved Barris jabbed at the comlink control and the &quot;Full alert!&quot; toward the sentry perimeter. &quot;All troopers, full alert. Major Wyan, where are you?&quot; &quot;Here, sir,&quot; the perimeter to Barris's right. &quot;All comlink channels are out.&quot; &quot;I know,&quot; &quot;Enough is enough. There are eighteen stormtroopers beating the to recall them. We're pulling out.&quot; Wyan's mouth fell open slightly. &quot;We're leaving, sir?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;Any objections?&quot; The major's lip twitched. Perhaps he'd been listening in on Barris's &quot;No, sir, no objections. What about that?&quot; He jerked a thumb at the alien encampment. An encampment they hadn't much gotten around in the Senate who would probably make trouble examination. But there was an answer for that, too. &quot;We'll take it with us,&quot; Barris said. Wyan's mouth dropped another couple of millimeters. &quot;We'll what?&quot; &quot;I said we'll take it with us,&quot; &quot;Plenty of room in the transport for all of Tell the techs to break out the heavy load aboard in half an hour. Move it!&quot; Wyan swallowed visibly. &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; at a brisk trot. Cautiously, Barris tried the comlink. But it was still being blanketed by the jamming With a curse, and a painfully tight sensation There was only one reason to jam their communications: unseen enemy out there was preparing to launch Stepping over into the partial cover of one within shouting range of the entire Imperial and prepared for battle. But once again, the enemy refused to play Within ten minutes the first of the stormtroopers to the orders from Barris's messengers. The comlink jamming continued as the rest but the attack Barris had anticipated never And within his stipulated half hour, the alien and they were ready to leave. Except for a single, tiny hitch. One of the eighteen stormtroopers was missing. &quot;What do you mean, missing?&quot; Barris demanded as three of the stormtroopers four of their comrades taking up backstop them. &quot;I thought these were the new elite of Palpatine's How could one of them be missing?&quot; &quot;I don't know, sir,&quot; &quot;But I've come to the conclusion you were The sooner we get out of here, the better.&quot; Abruptly, Barris came to a decision. To blazes with the stormtroopers -- if they was their business. &quot;Have all techs board the transport,&quot; &quot;The troopers will follow, in standard retreat/guard We'll leave as soon as everyone's aboard.&quot; &quot;What about the stormtroopers?&quot; Wyan asked. &quot;They've got the troop carrier they came down Barris said. &quot;They can stay behind and beat the bushes He turned toward the transport the techs had of the stormtroopers standing rigid guard &quot;You -- stormtrooper -- go tell your commander He never finished the sentence. Without twitch or warning, the stormtrooper Barris was flat on the ground in an instant, &quot;Alert!&quot; forest edge for any sign of the attacker. But as always, there was nothing. A handful of troopers -- brave or suicidal, that direction anyway. For all the good that would do. Beside him, Wyan gave a sudden, awe-struck &quot;Colonel - look at that.&quot; Barris swiveled on his stomach to face the The smoke of the explosion was clearing away, only minor damage. Mostly cosmetic, in fact, and nothing that hull integrity. He lowered his eyes to the crumpled form of in shock. The armor, no longer white, was scattered around the spot where the stormtrooper had The armor was all there was. The body itself had been completely disintegrated. &quot;I don't believe it,&quot; &quot;That blast wasn't that powerful. How could it have destroyed the body so completely?&quot; &quot;I don't know,&quot; &quot;And for the moment, I don't care. We're getting out of here. Now.&quot; He eased his comlink on, discovered the jamming &quot;This is Colonel Barris,&quot; &quot;All Imperial troops are to return to the &quot;Sir?&quot; Wyan murmured, staring out at the forest. &quot;Looks like they found him.&quot; Barris followed his gaze. Emerging into the clearing were the three missing comrade ... and they had indeed found Or at least, what was left of him. &quot;The perfect end to a perfect mission,&quot; &quot;Come on, Major. Let's get out of here.&quot; TRANSITION Barris had half expected the transport and from the forest and headed for the sky. But no missiles or laser pulses followed them shelter of the Strikefast's hangar bay. Captain Parck was waiting beside the transport &quot;Colonel,&quot; &quot;I don't recall giving you permission to leave &quot;No, sir, you didn't,&quot; own voice. &quot;But as you yourself pointed out earlier, I did what I deemed best.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; For a moment he continued to look at Barris, It seemed to Barris that his eyes lingered by the impossible explosion that had disintegrated &quot;Well, what's done is done. I'm told you brought the alien encampment &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; to read his commander's expression. He would have expected Parck to be angry, troopers' performance. But instead, he seemed merely thoughtful. &quot;Do you want me to have the techs get back &quot;There's no hurry,&quot; &quot;For now, everyone is to report to debriefing. Those smuggler attacks were far too effective; down there.&quot; He brought his gaze hard onto Barris: me back to my office.&quot; So he was going to drop the hammer on Barris A small favour, at least. &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; They left the hangar bay; but to Barris's Instead, the captain led the way up to the had been inexplicably darkened. &quot;Sir?&quot; Barris asked as Parck stepped to the observation &quot;An experiment, Colonel,&quot; board. &quot;All right, dim the lights in the hangar bay.&quot; Barris stepped to Parck's side as the lights levels. The transport and troop carriers they'd just beyond them at the other end of the bay were courier ship. No one was in sight anywhere. &quot;What sort of experiment?&quot; Barris asked. &quot;The testing of a theory, actually,&quot; &quot;Make yourself comfortable, Colonel. We may be here a while.&quot; They'd been there nearly two hours when a transport. Silently, it slipped across the darkened hangar of the sparse cover along the way. &quot;Who is that?&quot; Barris asked, straining his eyes to try to &quot;The source of all your troubles down on the Parck said with obvious satisfaction. &quot;Unless I'm mistaken, that's the alien whose Barris frowned. One alien? One alien? &quot;That's impossible, sir,&quot; &quot;Those attacks could not have been the work &quot;Well, we'll see if one or two others join Parck said. &quot;If not, I would say he was it.&quot; The shadowy figure had moved across the floor For a moment it paused as if considering. Then, deliberately, it stepped to the door &quot;It appears he was indeed alone,&quot; it on. &quot;All right, commander, move in. He's in the middle Kappa. Set all weapons for stun: I want him alive TRANSITION After all the trouble the alien had created Parck had expected him to put up a terrific To his mild surprise, the other apparently any resistance at all. Perhaps he was taken by surprise. More likely, he knew when resistance was futile. Which to Parck's mind merely made the creature And made the nebulous plan forming in the The hangar bay lights had been restored to escorted the alien out of the shuttle, and as the prisoner was brought over to where He was generally very human in size and build, He was dressed in what appeared to be skins animals from the forest where he'd been living. In the center of a square of armed stormtroopers, confidence about him as he walked. &quot;Look at that,&quot; voice as he gestured toward the alien. &quot;Reminds me of those dirty Jawa things on You know, with those -- &quot; &quot;Quiet, Colonel,&quot; came to a stop in front of him. &quot;Welcome aboard the Victory Star Destroyer Do you speak Basic?&quot; For a moment the alien seemed to be studying &quot;Some,&quot; &quot;Good,&quot; &quot;I'm Captain Parck, commander of this ship. What's your name?&quot; Leisurely, the alien let his gaze drift around Not like a primitive overwhelmed by the size military man sizing up his enemy's strengths. And weaknesses. &quot;I am called Mitth'raw'nuruodo,&quot; &quot;Mitth'raw'nuruodo,&quot; word and not succeeding all that well. &quot;First of all, I want you to know that we down there. We were chasing smugglers, and happened upon One of our standing orders is to study all &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;So said also the K'rell'n traders who Parck frowned. K'rell'n traders? &quot;Must mean Corellians,&quot; &quot;Ah,&quot; &quot;Of course. I imagine dealing with them is how you learned &quot;What do you wish of me?&quot; Mitth'raw'nuruodo asked. &quot;What do you wish of us?&quot; Parck countered. &quot;You went to a great deal of effort to inveigle What did you hope to accomplish?&quot; &quot;If you plan to kill me, I would ask that Mitth'raw'nuruodo said, ignoring the question. &quot;We don't have to just ask you these questions,&quot; &quot;We have drugs and interrogation methods -- &quot; &quot;Enough,&quot; an upraised hand. &quot;You'll have to excuse Colonel Barris, Mitth'raw'nuruodo. You ran him and his troopers around in concentric about that.&quot; The alien looked at Barris. &quot;It was necessary.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; Parck persisted. &quot;What did you hope to accomplish here?&quot; &quot;To return home.&quot; &quot;You were shipwrecked?&quot; &quot;I was exiled.&quot; The word seemed to hang in the fume-scented &quot;Why?&quot; Parck asked into the silence. &quot;The leaders and I disagreed,&quot; Parck snorted under his breath, thinking about Senate. &quot;Yes, we have the same problems with some he told Mitth'raw'nuruodo. &quot;Perhaps we can help each other.&quot; The alien's eyes narrowed slightly. &quot;How?&quot; &quot;As you see, we have many starships,&quot; bay. &quot;There's no reason why we couldn't provide &quot;In exchange for what?&quot; &quot;I'll tell you in a moment,&quot; &quot;First, though, I'd like to know exactly how down there.&quot; &quot;It was not difficult,&quot; again. &quot;Your spacecraft crashed near my place of your following troops arrived. The pilot was dead. I took his body and hid it away.&quot; &quot;And filled his flight suit with grass,&quot; &quot;Hoping we wouldn't notice you'd taken his &quot;And you didn't,&quot; &quot;More important to me was that you would find that you would thus bring the suit and fermented &quot;Fermented berries?&quot; Barris echoed. &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;When fermented and crushed, pyussh berries animals.&quot; &quot;Which you'd strapped the gimmicked blaster Barris said suddenly. &quot;That's how you got them in past our sentry &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;Also how I attacked the soldiers later. I used a sling to throw more of the berries to them.&quot; &quot;You also caused a TIE fighter to crash,&quot; &quot;At least, I presume that was your doing. How did you accomplish that?&quot; Mitth'raw'nuruodo shrugged fractionally. &quot;I knew the spacecraft would come to search. In preparation I had strung some of my monofilament One of the spacecraft hit it.&quot; Parck nodded. And at such low altitude, of course, the pilot the sudden impact. &quot;It wouldn't have done you any good to capture he told the alien. &quot;They're not equipped with hyperdrives.&quot; &quot;I did not expect the spacecraft to survive,&quot; &quot;I wanted the pilot's equipment. And his comlink.&quot; &quot;But you didn't take the comlink,&quot; &quot;We checked at the encampment and it was still &quot;No, you are mistaken,&quot; &quot;What was there was the comlink from the first Parck smiled in spite of himself. So simple, yet so ingenious. &quot;So you switched the comlinks. That way, when we finally discovered the first you still had one that functioned. Very ingenious.&quot; &quot;Actually, very simple,&quot; &quot;So you killed a TIE pilot for his comlink,&quot; Clearly, he wasn't nearly as impressed by &quot;Why did you keep killing my men? For the fun of it?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; &quot;So that soldiers with fuller armor would &quot;With fuller -- ?&quot; &quot;The stormtroopers? You wanted stormtroopers to come?&quot; &quot;Your soldiers wore helmets,&quot; around his forehead. &quot;No good for me.&quot; He touched a hand to his face. &quot;I needed armor that would cover my face.&quot; &quot;Of course,&quot; &quot;That was the only way you would be able to &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;I used an explosive on one first, so that &quot;Just a minute,&quot; &quot;How did you do that without anyone hearing &quot;It came at the same moment I began the communications the alien said. &quot;Of course, no one heard.&quot; &quot;Which you accomplished using the comlink Parck suggested. &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;I studied the armor and found a way to kill I did so, then walked into the camp and went No one was yet inside. With small branches I had brought I stood with an explosive inside to destroy it.&quot; &quot;So that we wouldn't realize there were actually Parck nodded again. &quot;Again, ingenious. Finally, then, where did you hide during the &quot;Inside the second power generator casing,&quot; &quot;It is nearly empty - I have been using it Parck cocked an eyebrow at him. &quot;Which implies you've been here for a while. I can see why you wanted so desperately to Mitth'raw'nuruodo drew himself up to his &quot;I was not desperate. It is necessary that I return to my people.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; Parck asked. Again, the alien seemed to study him. &quot;Because they are in danger,&quot; &quot;There are many dangers in the galaxy.&quot; &quot;Including us?&quot; Barris growled. The alien didn't flinch. &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;And how would you help protect your people Parck said, throwing an annoyed look at Barris. &quot;They do not accept the concept of -- I do An attack made against an enemy before he &quot;A pre-emptive strike,&quot; &quot;A pre-emptive strike,&quot; &quot;I alone of our warrior leaders accept this of warfare.&quot; So, he'd been a warrior leader, then. Obvious, now, really. &quot;And you think you can now persuade your people &quot;I do not intend to try,&quot; &quot;I do not need their permission to fight on &quot;What, all by yourself?&quot; Barris said, his voice half incredulity and Mitth'raw'nuruodo eyed him, and Parck in the alien's face. &quot;If necessary.&quot; &quot;That's very gallant,&quot; &quot;Also, very foolish. And potentially very wasteful.&quot; &quot;You have an alternative to suggest?&quot; the alien countered. Parck smiled slightly. &quot;You're still studying us, aren't you?&quot; &quot;Even now, as our prisoner, with little hope &quot;Of course,&quot; &quot;You said it yourselves: you are potential &quot;True,&quot; &quot;On the other hand, how better to neutralize Out of the corner of his eye he saw Barris's &quot;Captain, what are you suggesting?&quot; &quot;I'm offering Mitth'raw'nuruodo the chance Parck said, watching the alien's face closely. There was no surprise there, no change of Perhaps he was too shocked to react. More likely he'd already anticipated the offer. Perhaps had even deliberately maneuvered the &quot;Emperor Palpatine has many enemies,&quot; &quot;The resistance groups sprouting up show that A warrior leader of Mitth'raw'nuruodo's &quot;But he's an -- &quot; &quot;An alien?&quot; Parck finished for him. &quot;Yes, he is. But sometimes that doesn't make a difference.&quot; &quot;It does with Palpatine,&quot; &quot;Not always.&quot; Parck lifted his eyebrows slightly. &quot;I'm willing to risk it, Mitth'raw'nuruodo. How about you?&quot; &quot;The benefit to you is clear,&quot; &quot;What would be the benefit to me?&quot; &quot;Access to the Fleet's files on aliens here Parck said. &quot;A chance to use your skills to seek out and exist within the boundaries of the Empire.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;And who knows? Perhaps the Emperor would be willing to send neutralize those other threats to your people After all, a threat to your people would also Mitth'raw'nuruodo's eyes flicked to Barris. &quot;And if I am not acceptable to your people?&quot; &quot;Then I give you my personal promise that Parck said. &quot;Sir, I strongly suggest you reconsider this,&quot; &quot;The Emperor will never accept this -- this Parck smiled to himself. No, the Emperor did not in general think very notable if top secret exceptions. Such as the aliens Darth Vader had discovered service to Palpatine. The commander of Vader's ship on that mission the Academy - had been promoted to Vice Admiral Maybe Parck had finally found a way to match Or even to pass him up. &quot;Have we an agreement?&quot; &quot;The risk is worth taking,&quot; &quot;I will come speak with your Emperor.&quot; Parck smiled, a warm sense of satisfaction He had his prize now, all right. A far better prize than the petty and totally planet below. &quot;Excellent,&quot; &quot;We'll leave at once. One warning, though: you're almost certainly 'Mitth'raw'nuruodo' is far too hard for &quot;Of course,&quot; He looked at Barris, those glowing red eyes of a Jawa's -- glittering in deep contrast hair. &quot;Perhaps my core name would be easier for Call me Thrawn.&quot; &quot;Thrawn it is, then,&quot; &quot;And now, perhaps you'll accompany me to the Your Imperial orientation might as well begin TRANSITION From the mouth of the cave, Llollulion warbled [BORLOVIAN: &quot;By the Winds - the Imperial primates Our would-be allies have forced them to give &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Terrik demanded, coming up beside him. &quot;They're not going to give up now.&quot; [BORLOVIAN: &quot;You say my sight is not true?
