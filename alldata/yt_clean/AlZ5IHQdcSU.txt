Ah he got me through the wall! Shit I juice! Ah! We maybe should have I think it was a mistake to think that uh... the early ones.&quot; [Mason] &quot;You go for the computer, [Connor] &quot;Okay.&quot; [Spiff] &quot;Good teamwork Mason! So these two houses I guess? Connor, are-&quot; [Connor] &quot;I locked one - I locked one outside, be careful!&quot; [Spiff] &quot;I see that!&quot; This guy seemed pretty fast.&quot; [Connor] &quot;I got one, I got [Spiff] &quot;Can you not close the door? Better get in a locker! Where did that's why I'm kind of thinking we should is garbage, it is - I'd say the corn is the You can jump the fence and skip it? I sent it 2 minutes 50 seconds, world record. Where's your quality settings to just absolute funny! Okay. Gets to here, it's just a crouch jump. Follow me and don't fall off. We're going to then... and then what? And then, and then, and then, left I think. And then all the way. So this - we've now, we've made it, we should probably... well you know we can do... yeah we could keep, we could do at least this first level. Come, come on in, come on [Spiff] &quot;Do we need a code? Cuz I'm pretty sure I just have to figure it out ourselves. It's 42069. We're the code should be somewhere around here. Okay that. Oh! There's tickets here that say 931. Mason! I found tickets in a corner that say 931. 9, 3, 1, civilization.&quot; [Spiff] &quot;Meg. Oh. Oh!&quot; [Mason] &quot;Did you not see [Game] &quot;The red and yellow lights indicate that there's danger entering. The green light indicates that [Mason] &quot;Pre-order!&quot; [Spiff] &quot;So are they like selling bits of the backrooms? Whoa whoa don't fall through the floor sand! I got eaten by like a big frog!&quot; [Connor] &quot;So wait, wait did I have some- &quot; [Spiff] &quot;That thing was originally supposed to die too I'm assuming that's a checkpoint.&quot; [Spiff] That's so funny he's so goofy looking! Can you I, I saw underneath us, like I assume the or something.&quot; [Mason] &quot;I think we have to go down flashlight?&quot; [Spiff] &quot;They're both dead! Damn that was quick. Yeah, true, yeah the concept of no All right I'm gonna let gargantua take me here. Maybe [Connor] &quot;Yeah there's like a - this map thing light! So I guess those lights just dropping on to an enemy. Did [Mason] &quot;I hope I don't get cornered, I don't have a flashlight. Oh hi!&quot; [Spiff] &quot;Oh hi! Dies. If someone dies while you're on them? I see. Hey well, Connor's doing something go chat. Is that dirty clothes in the background look like you have a clean room. Actually, look Little bit of Loaf action! Did it save your [Connor] &quot;So there's these machines in the rooms, and like a, like an - a section, when the dial goes through will turn it green. I think I've - if it's the saving, I'm guessing that all the rest of them nothing of what you just said.&quot; [Connor] &quot;Uh basically find turn- &quot; [Spiff] &quot;Get ganked. We all died?&quot; [Mason] &quot;That's twitching. Ohhh... I got to open the - leave reality. Ah, nice. So Connor - if Connor got a few It shows on here right? Oh we only got two of them! magazine? Yeah. Yeah I liked reading their weird raise kids. And so I bought a subscription kind Today's Parent magazines! I just had so many. I they would have been highly educated - educating. I got them in the first place, was because there list of how good certain Disney princesses were upset, because, for Tangled - it rated Tangled really I don't know why it rated it so low, but Meghan for the man, but to see the twinkly lights. And that. So how upside down is this? Like can I - turn Goofy fucking guy. Is Mason...? Oh they're both trying. I have opened a door. It saves think I'll die! It's so awkward finding literally like - I mean best way to explain think it's the same map just upside down.&quot; [Spiff] &quot;Oh, there's the doors down there, and then you do the It's a mirror image but it spawns you sense. I died but I got a door open!&quot; [Connor] &quot;No So now we can get past that guy.&quot; [Connor] &quot;I think [Spiff] &quot;Nice!&quot; [Mason] &quot;Oh [Friend] &quot;That's unfortunate.&quot; [Spiff] &quot;Barely made it. this is a good place. This is a good place to ready to beat all the levels, and nobody would to the right.&quot; [Spiff] &quot;What's this game made with? If it's you actually decided to no clip around in the you see this, I didn't have time to finish this That's kind of cool!&quot; [Julian] &quot;Who out of the four of [Julian] &quot;Well, I think that's debatable.&quot; [Spiff] &quot;You asked!&quot; [Connor] &quot;So you I'm lightly drinking, okay?
