From today to the year 3000: What does the future hold? What its inhabitants in the centuries to come? sometimes feels like the prelude to something This captivating video seeks to decipher the signs the nearly nothing we hold in our hands today. leading the dance of change, while and all the others will have the seemingly trivial Before embarking on our journey through time, let Numerous micro and macro factors could unimaginable social shifts, or climate disasters. so by discussing the remaining decades of "Roll intro" Out of all the emerging technologies in the 21st century, artificial the most significant impact. By the 2020s, AI comparable to human abilities, both in chatbot by the mid-century, even more significant capable of disrupting the lives of billions. jobs will lead to increased technological reforms, such as guaranteed universal income. of life expectancy will create an increasing Alongside this, immigration will continue attract more foreign workers while controlling In addition to medical advances in reversing of this century will include human of a biological signature on an exoplanet. most significant events that, even though they may not unfold in the exact 2030. The Extremely Large Telescope is fully this telescope, with its extraordinary 39-meter impact on astronomical knowledge. It's set to James Webb Space Telescope, which cost ten times European Southern Observatory, it will possess the delve into their atmospheres, and potentially protoplanetary disks around distant stars. deorbited. After entering service in November tear from solar radiation and the relentless microgravity environment, the Station has from medicine and biotechnology to materials ecosystems and responding to natural calamities for testing future spacecraft technologies and travel on human health, crucial for paving the 2035. The consumption of lab-grown meat is rapidly in the field of biological tissue engineering meat from individual animal cells. Following array of meat-based products is now available, meat offers a host of benefits, being produced and demanding substantially lower quantities of significantly diminished environmental footprint. 2036, humans landed on Mars. The Humanity mission, planet's surface for three months before 2037. The global population reaches 9 billion. by often harsh and brief life spans, the world's the modern era has ushered in unprecedented and overall living standards. Remarkably, spanning 1805 to 1925, the number of people on billion. The following billion took only 35 taking a mere 14 years. Predictions indicate gradual decline.
