I'm loving this! [Adum] -It's like so much worse acting than... [Scoot] -I was gonna say- it- Keanu's not known for his great acting... [Adum] -If he's working with the wrong director, it's like the worst shit ever... Knock Knock directed by uh Eli Roth is some of the most cringe shit I've ever seen. [Clip] -Call 911! Call 911!

[Clip] -in the head of the mnemonic- Roll credits! What if they did? [Adum] -Who was the first person to decide to put Keanu in serious movies? Because like, you'd have to say that that was a mistake. Until- [Scoot] -Certainly! [Adum] -and then it became successful. [Gael] -This was- this was before Dracula, right? [Scoot] -Was he in Bram Stoker's Dracula? he was in Bram Stoker- [Scoot] -I feel like that's like, '92. [Gael] -Opposite Gary Oldman. Who was all the rage at the time. [Scoot] -Gay old man.. [Adum] -To answer the question: Catherine Bigelow made the mistake. [Scoot] -Well at least we have a finger to point now... Henry Rollins?! Pretty sure that's the lead singer of Black Flag! [Gael] -Damn this really is the future! This looks like a Furry Convention! [Scoot] -Are furry conventions the future? [Gael] -Yes. [Adum] -It was Henry Rollins. [Scoot] -Boom.

[Scoot] -He &quot;matrixed&quot; them. [Adum] -Ow pffft! [Scoot] -Say something and be shocking again! [Clip] -I'm going in with mnemonic sensors. [Scoot] -Okay you said &quot;mnemonic&quot; and that's a different word... [Gael] -Yeah that's like pressure and... [Scoot] -Yeah... Gotcha! [Adum] -Ow my balls! [Clip] -I'll pay you 20 grand. -50. Deal! [Gael] -Can I just say, that's that's a Chad move right there; negotiating with the guy you're going to save. [the Pals making punching noises] [Adum] -That sound effect! That didn't make any sense! [Gael] -That's great. They hadn't figured out Combat music at the time. [Scoot] -Yeah music and sound effects both still in their infancy. [Gael] -It was mostly just one guy on a production. [Scoot] -Yeah. [Gael] -All of it. [Scoot] -Who had NEVER seen a real fight before! Like, yeah this is what punches sound like! [Scoot] -Oh sorry did he- [Scoot] -Did you just do a magic? [Gael laughs] [Adum] -It can't cut through that... [Gael] -Yeah, it can't break metal or anything. But- [Scoot] -Slice through a man like butter... [Adum] -That's just some leftover music from Omicron. [Gael] -I was gonna say I feel like, slightly better music would have made this movie like three times as good. [Adum] -There's a very lazy composer for this film! [Scoot] -That mans name is Hans Zimmer... [Adum] -David Bowie... [Gael] -Still looking for the plot... [Scoot] -So are these guys. [Scoot] -There it is! Nope... spoke too soon... [Gael] -Hey it's Oliver! [Adum] -There's a separate composer listed for the director's cut. Which was only a Japanese release. [Scoot] -ooh! [Gael] -I bet that one's a banger. [Scoot] -So, we're watching the &quot;uncool&quot; version. [Adum] -Apparently. [Clip] -You low techs- [Gael] -ooh &quot;low techs&quot; that's a slur. [Clip] -50 thou, you said.

[Clip] -You can't remember a thing? [Scoot] -Well maybe I could remember it if I had some sort of I don't know... mnemonic device or something! but I don't! [Clip] -You got parents and stuff! [Adum bursts out laughing] [Scoot] -Wow... [Gael and Adu] -That was acting. [Adum] -How did other directors turn this into something that didn't look so bad? [Scoot] -How did he get to do more than one of these? [Adum cackling] [Scoot] -What do you have on a Hollywood, Keanu? [Adum] -It works for the stoner comedy time- But, how do they get to do more than one of THESE? Like, people saw Johnny Mnemonic... and then said &quot;Gotta Have It!&quot; [Adum] -I'm sorry was that hacking? [Gael] -Yeah...

Are people doing face palms? [Gael] -I think Patrick Stewart invented this. [Adum] -AHHH! I can't get enough of it [Scoot giggling] [Adum] -That's so good... and it's just the same side effect over and over... [Scoot] -Crazy Bob's computer shop. [Adum] -Crazy Bob's!

Probably Knock Knock, from Eli Roth. It's like, it's really bad! I'm pretty sure the last scene the ending is like on YouTube. That's like one of the worst; it's just, it's so embarrassing. It was fun; I don't think uh it's Gonna Last In My Memory very long. [Gael] -Uh you might need a mnemonic for it. [Scoot] -You uh... nice thank you. [Scoot snickering] [Adum] -All right, well uh... [Scoot] -What was my favorite part, Adam? Great question, any part with Henry Rollins, because he rocks and everyone else is garbage. [Adum] -Yeah pretty much. He pronounced uh &quot;all come&quot; the best. [Scoot] -Yes and someone pronounced a mnemonic the worst, but I can't remember who. [Adum] -Yeah. We got some good hacking... Computer internet Dolphins... [Scoot] -We did get internet dolphins that the true thing that happened- [Gael] -that was quite an unexpected third act. [Adum] -Yeah- [Scoot] -What's with the smudges? [Gael] -Its not just me right? There's like, a smudge at the bottom of the screen? [Scoot] -Is it? Okay yeah, I see that. [Scoot] -Low Center. [Scoot] -Up to the right of it. [Gael] -Look, it's gone when there's no names anymore. [Scoot] -Yeah, it's when the- we're going what the fuck- [Gael] -Isn't that weird? [Scoot] -This is infuriating. [Adum] -Comment below if that's on your copy too. [Scoot] -Figure it out. [Adum] -Because I ripped the Blu-ray; it could be my ripping software that- I don't know... We've never seen that before. Anyway, uh thanks for watching. I guess we're all gonna die. Tristar? Synecdoche, thank you. Bye everybody. [Music]
