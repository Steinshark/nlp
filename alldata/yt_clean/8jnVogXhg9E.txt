Have you ever wondered what it would be like if Rapunzel lived in the coldest village on Earth? How would her long hair withstand the biting Arctic chill, where there's no running water and every task is a challenge? How would she adapt to a life where winter rules the year, and stepping outside in anything less than layers of fur could mean freezing? To find the answers, let's journey to a small icy village in Yakutia, where we meet Marina--the real-life Rapunzel of this frozen land. Marina is 29 years old, a nurse at the local hospital, and the mother of two children. Her hair is so long, thick, and something she's been growing her entire life. She's only cut it once and plans to keep it long forever, seeing it as part of who she is. Today is Saturday, a quieter day at home. Marina's husband is at work, and her youngest son, 4-year-old Niurgun, is visiting his grandparents. Marina starts her day by brushing her hair, a daily ritual to keep it healthy and tangle-free in the freezing Yakutian climate. Keeping her hair healthy in temperatures that can freeze boiling water in seconds is no small feat. Marina uses traditional Yakutian remedies, like horse oil, to protect their hair from breaking in the dry, icy air. Marina and her 9-year-old daughter Alima are on a shared mission to grow their hair for life. Inspired by her mother, Alima admires her love for long hair and has promised to follow in her footsteps. Alima's hair has already reached 70 cm, while Marina's flows down an impressive 134 cm. Today, they are having a special day dedicated to hair care. Washing hair in Yakutia is no small task. With no running water due to frozen pipes and no showers in their home, they must prepare extensively. Heating the bathing house takes hours, and they need to collect ice from the river, melt it, and heat it for bathing. It's an all-day effort just to wash their hair. Alima, who dreams of becoming a doctor someday, sees this routine as part of her family's traditions. In Yakutia, long hair is more than just a personal choice--it's a symbol of beauty, femininity, and cultural pride. For Marina and Alima, it represents their strength and connection to their heritage, even in one of the harshest places on Earth. Life in Yakutia is no fairy tale. The cold is relentless, and even the simplest tasks, like washing hair or taking a shower, turn into challenging adventures. Marina starts her day gathering firewood for the stove. The fire not only heats her home but also the bathhouse--a crucial part of daily life where winter temperatures can plummet to -60 degrees Celsius. Most of the household responsibilities fall to Marina, as her husband works nearly every day repairing fridges, heating systems, and other essential appliances --a job in high demand during Yakutia's brutal winters, when frozen pipes and faulty boilers are common. Marina handles the heating, cooking, and water collection, often with the help of her 9-year-old daughter, Alima. Heating the bathhouse is no small task. Marina has to start hours in advance to ensure it's warm enough to battle the biting cold outside. Today, she's working to heat the bathhouse, using a large stack of firewood to bring it to the right temperature. After heating the bathhouse, Marina heads out to collect water--a task she must do every day to meet her family's essential needs. With no running water in the village, all the water they use comes from the nearby river. Marina carries a sturdy metal bucket through the thick ice covering the river's surface. Marina and her family live in a small village in western Yakutia. Life here revolves around basic necessities, with neighbors forming a close-knit community. Locals start their mornings tending to stoves, hauling water from wells or rivers, and ensuring their homes are insulated against the bitter cold. Crime is almost unheard of in this small, trusting community. Neighbors support one another, whether it's sharing firewood or helping clear snow. Despite the challenges, Marina's village is a place of resilience, where life revolves around adapting to the extremes of the Arctic and finding beauty in its frozen landscapes. Once at the river, she chops through layers of ice, sometimes over a meter thick, to reach the water beneath. The icy wind bites at her face, and the cold air makes every breath visible, but this daily chore is as much a part of her routine as cooking or cleaning. The water Marina collects is used for everything--drinking, cooking, washing dishes, and showering. It's hard process, but for Marina, it's a way of life. Despite the hard work, Marina does it with quiet determination, knowing it keeps her family warm, fed, and clean in one of the toughest places on Earth. Alima often helps her mother with this task, learning the skills she'll need to navigate life in the Arctic. Reaching the river is no small effort. Marina navigates through snowdrifts, pulling a sledge to carry the heavy water back home. After collecting the water and returning home, Marina prepares the bathhouse. The fire has been burning for several hours, and the small wooden bathhouse is finally warm enough to use. The bathhouse is a key part of Marina's weekly routine, and after all the effort of gathering water and heating the space, it's finally time for her most time-consuming task--washing her hair. Marina's hair is very long, reaching well past her knees, and washing it isn't easy The whole process takes about 30 minutes, from soaking it with warm water to rinsing out the soap. When her hair is wet, it becomes extremely heavy, often straining her neck and back. In her remote village, Marina doesn't have access to modern hair products like conditioners or shampoos. Instead, she uses a simple bar of soap, which works well for her. She also doesn't use a hair dryer or styling tools, letting her hair dry naturally. But her hair takes an entire day to dry naturally. Because of this, Marina never goes outside on hair-washing days; in Yakutia's extreme cold, wet hair could easily lead to illness and frostbite Since heating the bathhouse takes so much effort--chopping wood, hauling water, and hours of preparation Marina only washes her hair once a week After Marina finishes washing her hair, she wraps it in a towel and calls Alima to join her. The heated bathhouse is a rare luxury, and they make the most of it together I wash my hair once a week, usually on Sundays I don't take care of my hair that much I just use soap and maybe a hair mask once a month If you wash and brush your hair too often it will develop split ends So, I'm trying not to wash it too often And if you wash your hair too often, it will get dirty quickly and become oily It's better not to wash it too often My head doesn't hurt from the weight of my hair Instead, my hair saves me from the cold, I use it like a scarf For us Yakuts, long hair is a talisman that protects us and gives us strength so, I think having long hair is a good thing Life in Yakutia is a story of resilience and tradition. The people here face some of the toughest conditions on Earth, yet they embrace their culture with pride. Long hair, like Marina's, is not just a look--it's a symbol of their identity, passed down through generations. Even in this frozen land, the Yakut people continue to honor their traditions and keep their spirit alive.
