okay so in this video i wanted to cover a very common question i get asked by my u.s tax clients and it's simply do i pay taxes on foreign income right and the short answer is yes you do as a u.s tax resident you're subject to tax on your global earnings it doesn't matter where it comes from and so what we're going to do here is go through the rules and and some examples and then cover some potential uh tax planning strategies you can do to get some kind of relief if you're paying tax in multiple countries so under irc section 7701b irc is internal revenue code 7701b a u.s tax resident individual is subject to u.s federal income taxes on their worldwide income okay again worldwide it doesn't matter whether it's u.s or foreign source now what's a u.s tax resident well us tax resident is a u.s citizen right first and foremost or a u.s green card holder or an individual that meets the substantial presence test during that tax year okay so if you're an individual and you and you meet any one of these three tests you're going to be u.s tax resident once you're a u.s tax resident you're filing irs form 1040 right that's the form 1040 used to report for your u.s individual income tax return if you're a non-resident you might be filing a form 1040 nr but that's different from this slide that we're looking at okay so if you're a u.s tax resident next what do you need to worry about well under section 61a you report your gross income and gross income means that it's all income from whatever source derives so it doesn't matter whether it's u.s source income foreign source income as a us resident you're reporting everything absolutely everything and that's one of the drawbacks of being a us citizen is it doesn't matter where you live and work you're always reporting all your income to the irs you're paying taxes and that's just the um you know the price you pay for being uh you know a passport holder a blue passport holder so what are some examples here and what can you do to try to alleviate your taxes a bit so compensation for personal services number one sourcing for personal services we'll find these rules in sections 862 and 861 so compensation performed while a person is physically outside the u.s is going to be foreign source while a person that is physically inside the u.s and working is going to be u.s source income so under this scenario no matter whether it's foreign or u.s source the wages are still reported on your form 1040. that's the that's the key element here is even if it's foreign source income it's still going down in your form 1040. dividends how do dividends get treated so dividend income paid from a foreign corp is foreign source dividends while dividend income from a u.s corporation is u.s source again both types of dividends are reported on schedule b and they're subject to federal income taxes so if you have let's say so i'm a u.s citizen let's say i'm invested in a company that's in the united kingdom and i get paid a dividend that's foreign source dividends because it's coming from a uk limited company i'm still paying tax on it i still have to report the dividend income on schedule b pay the taxes um and then i might be able to take a credit we'll talk about that later so here here's the relief provisions for u.s tax residents right so foreign tax credit or foreign tax credits is a big one if you have foreign income so foreign source income that was subject to taxes in that foreign country you can claim generally a foreign tax credit on form 1116 to offset the u.s taxes calculated on that same income okay so what's an example of you know illustrating that point we have here john he's a us citizen he lives and works in germany and he makes a hundred thousand dollars per year which is subject to german income taxes and he pays twenty thousand dollars in german income taxes so as a u s citizen john has to report the one hundred thousand dollars in foreign source income on his 1040 and he calculates his u.s tax liability of 31 000 now because john has paid foreign taxes to germany he can claim a foreign tax credit of 20 grand against that 31 thousand dollar u.s federal tax liability so he owes the irs the net amount of eleven thousand so this is how the foreign tax credit provides relief for u.s taxpayers that are living in other countries and paying taxes there right you are allowed to offset your u.s liability against what you've already paid in a foreign country now the second most common exclusion here is the foreign earned income exclusion so if you're a u.s tax resident and you live and work overseas for at least 330 days during the year you can qualify for this fvie and exempt up to a certain amount of personal compensation from your federal taxes so in this example here we have emily she's a u.s citizen she lives and works in france and she makes 150 grand a year now under 10 40 for the 2020 tax year she reported her gross amount of wages of 150 and she calculated the amount of tax out on that however she can also attach a form 2555 this is the foreign earned income exclusion form to report the f.e.i.e amount which for that year is a hundred and seven thousand six hundred now what this does is she reports the gross amount of 150 and she basically takes a deduction for 107 600 and arriving at her adjusted gross income so her agi after accounting for the feie is now 42 400. that's the amount that gets computed uh for the taxable income number right so she gets her agi amount and then she takes her standard deduction or itemized deductions and she computes the amount of federal taxes owed on that net dollar amount so the fei can be very valuable to u.s taxpayers living and working abroad if this isn't beneficial or you don't qualify for it you can always rely on the foreign tax credit uh option as well but uh the idea here is and again just to reemphasize if you're a u.s tax resident you're paying taxes on everything even if you don't live in the u.s even if you don't live in the us you're a dual citizen i have a lot of clients that are u.s citizens they've got that second passport they've never even lived in the united states right because they were born to a parent that was a u.s citizen they are still a u.s tax resident so they have to file tax returns every year they have to pay taxes they can compute their net tax liability using these foreign tax credits or perhaps the fei exclusion but at the end of the day if you're a u.s tax resident you're filing a 1040 and you're paying taxes on your global income there's no way around that so i hope this was helpful to you if you have any questions please leave me a comment below happy to answer those and like always i look forward to seeing you again in the next video thank you so much
