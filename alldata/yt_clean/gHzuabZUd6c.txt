I laid a giant circle in the middle of nowhere, and this is a random subscriber, and if he stays in this circle for 100 days, I'll give him $500,000. Step inside the circle, and the 100 day counter will start. The timer is ticking. He has to survive in the circle for 100 days. There's nothing here. There's nothing yet. Chris! I'm about to drop off a house. This definitely gives me more confidence. I bet you didn't know you could lift a house with a crane. And that's zero training. Wait, which one's the gas again? Watch out for the stairs! You know what, actually. And inside this house is all the food, clothes, and supplies he needs to survive 100 days. Oh, no. This could have been a lot worse. Oh, my God. And this is Shawn's family. I wanted to let you guys get one final goodbye in before he started the challenge. No pain no gain, dad. You guys will be here when I walk out of that circle with a half million dollars. But I'm gonna miss you guys. Aw. I'm gonna cry a little bit. Okay. The video just started, and it's already emotional. Good luck. $500,000 is on the line. To be honest, it's a little emotional, but 300,000 calories, 100 days. Get the food organized, clothing figured out, figure out a way to keep my mind entertained, and I know if I walk out of that circle, I will regret it forever. One night down, 99 to go. Let's go get organized. All right, strategy session number one. I gotta figure out what I got, how much I got, and what I'm gonna do to organize it. This is all the food you're getting for the next hundred days. So if you eat all this in the first, let's say, 50 days, you're done. It looked like a lot more food until I started condensing it down. Shawn. Hello. We have over a dozen cameras monitoring his every move 24/7 if he steps on that red line, we will see it. What do you think the hardest part of this challenge will be? Solo failure. No one beats me. I didn't get outplayed. He's still talking to us, and we're outside the trailer. Being in my own head. Hey, Shawn. I think they walked away. God, I hate them. Because Chris dropped my house so perfectly, my shower doesn't drain. Huge shout out, Chris. Really appreciate 100 days of dealing with this. It's cloudy, so I think it's a perfect day to get outside and try to plant some vegetables. Oh, I gotta pay attention where I'm walking. Cause if I walk across that game over, that red line is death. If I touch it, it's over. So I'm gonna take the wood out back and create kind of like a secondary line. All right. Now I got my beautiful circle. Shawn. Come in. How's it going, man? Doing good. Wait a minute. Is this a cheerio? This is all you get for 100 days. You're wasting a cheerio. All right. Wow, it's really stale. I'm shocked at how fast Shawn is developing a routine. It is officially day ten. Sorry I'm dressed like this. I just gave away a chocolate factory. Shawn is nowhere to be seen on these cameras. Shawn, are you pooping? What? What? Okay. He didn't run away. Bro, how you doing? Good. Give me a hug. All right. Wait, so you're tracking your weight? I'm weighing in every seven days. So you're trying to just be jacked by the end? Yeah. So, I mean, at the end of it, I'll be ripped and $500,000 richer. Your wife's gonna love me. You seem to be doing really well. I'll see you in a month. A month? I think he's kidding, but he's probably not. I'm gonna try to build a garden today. I'm gonna try to replant it away from that crazy red line. One of the things I plan on doing with the money is to put my farm 100% on solar power. My farm will be like a giant Tesla. That's the dream. That's what we're trying to do at the homestead. Can't wait to get out and get my money. And I'm gonna go on a nice vacation for a while, I think. Whoa. Jimmy just told me there's a tornado watch. Are you gonna leave the circle for the severe weather? I'm like, I'm from Oklahoma. Whoa. There's no way that tarp is worth a half million dollars. Oh, yeah, here it comes. My poor money's blowing away. Okay, I'm going inside. I have water peeing from the ceiling. My toilet won't flush because I'm guessing the tank out there is full of water from the rain leaking into it. You guys see that gentleman behind us? He's been in that circle for 16 days. That's longer than you went without eating, bald guy. You didn't have to bring up that video. Have you seen your second floor yet? No, I've been trying to get up there. It's a bit steep. Hey, Jimmy, you're bald. Yeah, I'm just gonna stay out of it. I feel like if I stay in here, they will bother each other and not me. Since the boys are being rude, I'm gonna leave them trapped. We want out. I will bring the ladder back if you just apologize. Run it down. I think we're ready to get out. I want an apology. I'm sorry you're bald. I'm sorry I called you bald. Was it that hard? Yeah, it hurt. So the boys made quite the mess of my house yesterday. My yard is now covered in glass. Very frustrating. I'm worried this challenge might be getting to Shawn. Would you come into my house and screw with stuff? I don't think so. This thing just smacked me in the nuts. How you doing, Chandler? Scared. I would be too. We installed that ferris wheel in 2 hours. Get me down. Shawny. To celebrate you being 25% done. We brought you a carnival so you can enjoy the day. This is awesome. Nothing but net. Aw. Bruh. Oh, first throw. There we go. This mini game isn't very fun. Oh, my gosh. I'm so terrified of heights. You're 25 days in. Do you still think you're gonna make it the full hundred? I can't see why not. This competition's a huge sacrifice. I only get so many summers with my kids, right? Before they're gone and out of the house, so that's tough. So I was organizing all my clothes, and as I was going through it, I started finding little notes from my daughter, my youngest. I have four kids and a wife, and this will be the most alone I've been in 18 years. Rationing food. Survival is gonna be rough, but if anything makes me walk out of here, it's gonna be the loneliness. I just don't want to think about it. All I know is Gordon Ramsay, he ain't got nothing on me. Because I only gave him 300,000 calories of food. Shawn really had to think about how he rationed it, which led to some pretty interesting choices. So this may be my first bad one. It's just a bunch of leftovers. Boiled for safety. It's disgusting. Very cabbagey. There's a camera above me. I'm not sleeping naked during this 100 day challenge, Jimmy. Just know I did that for you. Just to spare you from my nakedness. This morning, I heard, hey, Shawn, there's a spider in your bed. My bed is now flipped over. I'm leaving the circle. This is my last day. You know, you've been here a long time. When living inside of a circle in a MrBeast video seems normal. Day 39. It's father's day. I kept waking up thinking I was home, really missing my family. This is gonna be a tough day. And what Shawn didn't know is that I brought his family to the circle to surprise him for Father's day. Shawn, I have a present for you. Oh, yeah? Happy Father's Day. Almost makes me feel bad for trapping him in here. They didn't really consult with me. They just brought a present. And I'm not about to tell this little girl she can't give her dad a present, so I caved. And here you go. Oh, okay. I appreciate it. Oh, my God. Not only did they give you a gift, but they also get to spend the next 24 hours with you. No way. You guys are gonna be so bored. Are those my drawings on the fridge? Yeah. So your drawings on the fridge. Nice. I didn't think he would keep these. Oh, it's the wife. It had nearly been a month since Shawn saw his family, so I decided to give them some privacy until the next day. It must be nice to be able to walk out of the red circle. Really appreciate it, Jimmy. That was the best. It's a new day, and Ryan is here, who traveled across America to give me this penny. Hey, guys. Shawn, I'm coming in. Come on in. Do you know what he's carrying? A penny. Do you know why he's carrying this penny? My kids told me all about this. Wait, really? Yeah. Oh, no. I'm gonna give it to you for entertainment. Really? Here you go. Tomorrow's day number 50, and we have a big surprise for him. But don't tell him, okay? Okay. Okay. All right. It is officially day 50 of Shawn surviving in the circle. And I invited some of my YouTube friends to celebrate this special moment. It's us his YouTube friends. I need a break. Shawn. Shawn, what day is it? 50? Exactly. In front of you is $100,000 in cash. And if you get out right now, I'll let you keep it. No. Why 100 grand? I can just chill here and get another 400. All right, what if it was, like, 150 grand? Would it still be enough? I think, like, above 400, I would think... You're crazy! 400. Okay, well, in case you did say yes, I invited a marching band. Bring in the marching band. Hey, do you want to know what the best part about this is? I paid them to be here all night. Good luck. For the first 50 days, I wanted to see if Shawn could make it. I've done this, right? I've done 50 days. For the last half of this challenge, we have some pretty crazy stuff planned. This is probably something you'll never see. Oh, my God. Honestly, I didn't think it was gonna end like this. July 4th. Day 54. Happy birthday, America. You guys ready? They're lighting them. They're lighting. They lit. Go, go. What if you got out right now? Gotta watch out for the circle. No, it's not. I just bought random fireworks. I didn't know they were that crazy. Cease fire. Cease fire. I can't even see. Is that a good show or what? Honestly, we should become firework experts. Yeah, dude, I basically am. All right, Shawn, more importantly, it is now July 5, which means we need to leave. Yeah. More fireworks. We're not gonna celebrate anything on July 5. Okay. Thank you. I'm a little terrified of what Jimmy comes up with next. Did you say you're terrified? Of what I'm gonna come up with next? Yes. Do you want me to just leave you alone for a month? No, that'd be even worse. Okay see you in a month. That's, like, almost all the days that are left. Here's the aftermath. There's multiple times where I was way too close to the edge. So I'm thinking about digging a moat. If Jimmy's really not coming back for 30 days, I should have an entire moat built by time he gets back. Today, I eat a can of mixed vegetables and a can of turkey. I didn't even heat it up. Food is going to be an issue. This is meat, and it smells. And I've kind of tapped out the things to do inside the 60 foot circle. I dug a moat, made a garden, made a fire pit, which is too hot to use. Made like a fence around the back and made a hammock. So I'm just here existing. I don't feel like doing really anything, so I'm just going to sleep. That is Shawn's house, and I haven't been there in 30 days. Let's see if he's still alive. Just kidding. I check in on the cameras every single day. I know he's alive. Looks like he dug a moat around the circle. Let's see how he's doing. Hey, buddy. Hey. Did you miss me? Yes. Well, does it feel refreshing? It's like seriously shaking. You're that excited to see us? No, definitely. Wow. I had no idea that not visiting Shawn for 30 days would affect him this much. Oh, you do look much thinner. Did you lose weight? I'm 22 pounds down. Wow. We've done a lot since you last saw me. What did you do? And this is my storm window. And I sit here and watch the storm come in and listen to the lightning. Proud of you. Thank you. Things are about to start ramping up. The last ten days are gonna be crazy. What'd you say? Don't worry about it. Honestly, I thought the 30 day challenge was kind of like my hard challenge, but it sounds like he's not done with me, which is a little concerning. Shawn, what's the best way to cut a cake in half? With a knife. Okay, what's the best way to cut a house in half? Oh, shoot. Look. He keeps checking all the windows to see if we're gonna cut the house in half. Look at that. He's gonna be so confused until I return tomorrow. So I was calling Jimmy's bluff on this, but then I just look outside. I need you to cut it in half and get rid of that half. You're legit gonna cut my house in half? I just learned how to drive this five minutes ago. Yeah. I just wanna tell you that it's only gonna get harder. That's what I'm worried about. No. Wow. Oh, my God. I didn't think this would actually work. Ah. Oh, my God. You're good. Oh, my God. In a couple days, we may or may not just burn the house down. If I do anything, I'll let you double for him. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. That was a rough day. It's nine days to go. At this point, I don't even care. I don't even want to talk about how long I've been here. Well played, Jimmy. Well played. I'm staying. So it's officially hotter in my room than it is outside at this point. Shawn, I will give you a quarter of a million dollars if you get out right now. You know, it's hot. I want to give you a way out. It's so hot. It's like, 100 degrees today, but I think I'd rather die than give up on this challenge at this point. Really? Yeah. Well, that was all. I'll see you tomorrow. Oh. I give you guys full permission to go full idiot mode. There's nothing going on up there. Don't worry about it. Chandler must be here. Oh, no, no, no. I think I should go check on what they're doing. What? Over there? Yeah. These windows are kind of useless. Yeah, but nothing hurts you more than emotional damage. Wow. Thanks for the entertainment, boys. See you tomorrow. I guess they're giving up. Here they come to get their fancy cameras. This is probably something you'll never see on the YouTube side. And now the circle is surrounded by speakers. The worst part is it stops every once in a while. It goes and then it kicks right back on. Maybe I knock them all over flat. I can fill the speaker with water. I never eat processed food again. I think I might be okay. Hot. Oh, my God. Hot. All right, do you all see that house over there? I want you to surround it in a circle and say nothing. Break. Should I be scared? What the. All right, attention, clowns. Nod your head if you can hear me. Okay, I'll give you all a $1,000 each if you stay all night. Wait. I'll give you 2000 if you don't. There's, like, eleven of them. Oh, there's eleven of them. Oh, my goodness. I'll see you tomorrow. Well, guess what? There's still clowns out here. Little extra security there. You have less than 24 hours left in this circle. So we're gonna destroy your house with a wrecking ball to make it harder. What? Chris! Tear down the house. All right. Yeah. That part of your house is gone now. Not only did we bring a wrecking ball, but we also brought an excavator. Take the roof off! It's supposed to rain tomorrow. Good Demolition! and that's it for the destruction. See you in 19 hours. All right, sounds good. I'm gonna make a half million dollars tomorrow. Good night. Can you guys see the timer? There it is right there. Haven't seen them in a long time. Emotions are hitting me pretty heavy right now. Money's the thing we trade our life for. Giving up a third of a year of my life for a half million? Make sure you're trading your life for things that are worth it. How are you feeling? I'm so ready to get out of here. Yeah? Yeah. Do you mind staying in this room while I set up the surprise? I'm not leaving this room. I'm not risking getting out. Okay, it's gotta be minutes now. I hear people outside. You can just hear it. Just that background noise of 100 people talking. Everybody, it's time. Give me a countdown from 10. 10 - 9 - 8 - 7-6 - 5-4 -3 - 2 - Oh my gosh. Come on out. Oh, my God. It has officially been 100 days. Step on the red line. Are you sure? It has been 100 days. Okay, the challenge is over! Daddy. Are you okay? Yeah Are you excited? Here's your check for half a million dollars. Everyone give him a round of applause. This has been an amazing hundred days. I am glad it's over, though.
