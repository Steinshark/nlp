If you just got your new AeroPress or even if you brew AeroPress coffee daily and you travel with it all around the world like us, I bet you don't know all 10 interesting facts I'm about to share with you in this video. Hey guys, it's Ales from European Coffee Trip and you might be thinking who the heck am I to tell you something about the AeroPress? Well, apart of making videos on Youtube, we also produce a documentary film featuring a story of the AeroPress. It's called The AeroPress Movie. It's 45 minutes long and packed with exciting interviews and stories. We talked to James Hoffman, Tim Wendelboe or inventor of the AeroPress Alan Adler. From all the research we picked 10 exciting and perhaps surprising things that we learned about the AeroPress over the years. As a bonus if you stick to the end of this video We'll share a special discount for those of you who haven't seen The AeroPress Movie yet. So you can watch it right after you finish this video. Let's start with the fact number one. We all brew AeroPress coffee the wrong way. Perhaps not all of us, but the majority of us for sure. At least that is what I see on the internet and what I experience myself. We brew a big cup of black coffee we use an inverted method and we pour 90 to 95 degrees celsius water But that's not how the AeroPress was designed by the inventor. It should be brewed as an espresso style coffee often diluted by water or milk using fine grind and lower temperature. Fact number two. The inventor of the AeroPress is Alan Adler. Alan is turning 82 in 2020 and he has been inventing all kinds of products his whole life. What might surprise you though the most known and successful product before the AeroPress was the Aerobie flying ring that was extremely popular in 80s and 90s. It also got a Guinness world record for any thrown object in 1986. It was 383 meters and this record was broken again in 2003 with 406 meters. We are still waiting for the world Guinness record using the AeroPress. So do you have any ideas? Fact number three. It took 35 prototypes to make the best coffee maker possible. Alan's goal was to make a single cup coffee maker that can brew a coffee the way it's not bitter. Also make it rather fast. Ideally under one minute. He was building and testing it in his garage. He tried different sizes, different material and different ways to speed up brewing by pressurising it. The final prototype was somehow similar to the version we see on the market today. For a long time it was just a hobby or a fun project among many others. But later when coffee brewed with the AeroPress tasted superior to other brew methods they tested, they decided to give it a go. So a toy company turned into a coffee company. Fact number four. It was invented in the heart of Silicon Valley. Yeah, it was another successful company built out of the garage. Even though AeroPress, Inc. or Aerobie, Inc. back then is a tiny company comparing to all tech giant that share the same address. Actually, the headquarters of Google, Facebook or Apple are really only a few kilometers away from the AeroPress office. What is also interesting that the AeroPress is also manufactured in California. It's only 50 miles or 80 kilometers away from their offices. Fact number five. It wasn't accepted at first. When we think about the aeropress now, it seems like it has been here for ages and it was always popular but thing is it's not entirely true. Even though it sold millions of units by now it was brought on the market in 2005 which means only 15 years ago and it took over 3 years before the market accepted that. People appreciated the coffee brewed but it was laughed at because of the look. It was never the sexiest of coffee makers out there yet it also served a wave of specialty coffee by allowing people to brew one cup of coffee at a time and also to play with many brewing variables to fine-tune the preferred taste of coffee. We even made a video about 9 different ways how you can make coffee with the AeroPress. Fact number six. My aeropress is different than yours. Why? Most probably it was made from a slightly different material and body or print has a different color. Since it was released in 2005 it had already eight different combinations of material color and lettering. The last change happened during a release of the AeroPress Go in 2019. Gold foil lettering that I quite like to be honest has changed to the red lettering. Also a body of the AeroPress has a slightly different shade of grey. Okay, so this is our collection of AeroPresses. As you can see, each of them is a little bit different so this is the first one I get, it has a blue lettering and it was made in 2012 or 2013 and the other one as you can see, it has already AeroPress name on it. But the print is already washed out. And the third one is the one we brought from California when we were filming with Alan and you can see it has a signature from Alan and it has a really beautiful, in my opinion the best lettering, it's a gold foil and so it was made in 2017 and it was the last bit before the change when making The AeroPress Go that was released in 2019 and has a red lettering. Fact number seven. There is a coffee brewing competition called World AeroPress Championship. Yes, people are competing to find out the best AeroPress recipe of the year. It started back in 2008 in a small cafe in Oslo as a funny little activity to find an optimal brewing recipe to use behind the bar. There were only three competitors and it took about 15 minutes to find the winner. It started small but became popular quickly. Fast forward to 2017 when we visited the final of World Aeropress Championship in Seoul, South Korea. It was a big party. People from all over the world came to compete and have fun. There were 59 national AeroPress champions and several hundred spectators. Next years the final took place in Sydney and London. Unfortunately, there is no final in 2020 due to the Covid 19 restrictions, but we are hoping for the bright future. Fact number eight. Mile High AeroPress Club As you know AeroPress is ligh, durable, easy to pack what makes it an ideal coffee maker for traveling and camping. Many people use it to make coffee in the mountains, on the beach but also on the airplanes. Since coffee in the plane is known to taste awful, coffee geeks like us bring their equipment on board ask for hot water and make a delicious cup. If you do that, you can actually claim to become a member of the Mile High Aeropress Club. Fact number nine. Custom-made aeropresses painted in Australia. There are hardcore aeropress fans that wanted more than a regular AeroPress. The leader of the initiative is Tim Messenger based in Australia, who was making custom AeroPresses for several years now and sharing it on Instagram. A moment when a big crowd learned about it is when he partnered with the World Aeropress Championship to produce a batch of custom-made brewers for the championships in 2018 in Sydney and 2019 in London. Then designs got more and more creative and recently he passed over 700 custom-made AeroPresses. Fact number 10 AeroPress company was for sale. In 2016 Alan Adler announced that he is selling the company. It was a big shock and surprise for the coffee community but also for the members of the company. They sold the toy or sporting goods part of the company first and everybody was waiting for the final decision about the coffee part of the business, but nothing happened. Alan decided to keep the part of the business and get back to what he knows the best - creating and improving the products. The new version of the AeroPress got into making and the AeroPress Go the travel version of the famous coffee maker with updated packaging was released in 2019. We definitely like the improvements, but we hope it wasn't the last product from Alan and the team. So that was all 10 things I wanted to share with you today.
