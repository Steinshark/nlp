Burcu: Okay. Burcu: Look at this. Ozgur: Alright. Burcu: Ozgur. Burcu: Look what fell out of the tree. Ozgur: Whoa, did it fall just now? Burcu: If it falls, it will break the wind shield. Ozgur: This could hit us on the head. Ozgur: Alright, is there anything... Ozgur: that could fall? No. Ozgur: Maybe those. Ozgur: Come sit on it, I'll pull you too. Burcu: This is great. Burcu: Oh, I'm falling. Burcu: I fell down, hold up. Burcu: I fell down. Burcu: Honey, slow down. Burcu: We are touching the tree. Burcu: Let's not break it. Burcu: What did you do? Ozgur: Give me your hand. Ozgur: Give me your hand. Burcu: Look at the ground, it's all ice. Burcu: Look. Ozgur: It's ice. Burcu: It's a combination of all these things. Burcu: Where are we going to set up? Burcu: We're definitely going to set up on ice. Burcu: The ground's slipping. Ozgur: Let me inflate it first. Ozgur: Now... Burcu: It's slipping everywhere. Ozgur: Is it good? It's good. Burcu: How is this tree carrying this? It's so heavy. Burcu: We'll have to be careful walking around. Ozgur: Or we'll hit our heads. Ozgur: Okay. Ozgur: Is that good? Ozgur: Hop on it. Burcu: It's quite enough. Ozgur: Is it good? Ozgur: I can't, I have to take off my shoes. Burcu: Okay. Burcu: Where are the sleeping bags? Ozgur: I guess I didn't take them. Burcu: We have one spare sleeping bag, but the others? Ozgur: Hold on. Burcu: Did you look for the sleeping bags? Ozgur: It's not there, I didn't take it with me. Burcu: In every camp you forgot something. Ozgur: Anyway, at least we have one sleeping bag. Ozgur: This coat is already like a sleeping bag. Burcu: We'll sleep in out coats. Burcu: We have just one sleeping bag? Burcu: Did you see how my laces are frozen? Ozgur: You want water, right? Burcu: Yes, we have no water. Burcu: We'll return until the water boils. Burcu: I should get my boots inside. Burcu: These are also frozen. Burcu: The ground is really slippery. Ozgur: Honey, stomp your foot hard. Burcu: Look, that rock. Ozgur: Look at this one. Burcu: Oops, I slipped. Ozgur: I said step hard on the ground. Ozgur: Step hard, it's slippery here. Ozgur: Stomp your foot so that it sinks in. Ozgur: Look over there. Burcu: Yes, that's what I said. Ozgur: Come with me. Burcu: Honey, it's slipping here, look. Ozgur: Look, you're doing it wrong. Put your foot here. Ozgur: Okay. Burcu: What about you? Burcu: It's slipping like crazy. Ozgur: It's really bad. Ozgur: You have to come here. Ozgur: Wait for me. Ozgur: You can't slide. God forbid, you could go down the cliff. Burcu: It's a cliff down there, isn't it? Ozgur: I'm digging you a path here. Ozgur: Then I'll do it like this, hold on. Ozgur: How icy. Burcu: How beautiful. Burcu: Listen, can you hear the sound? Burcu: Oh, you found an axe. Ozgur: It's a nice axe. Burcu: Someone must have forgotten it. Ozgur: The handle is nice too. Ozgur: Hold it from the wrist, always. Burcu: On the one hand, you can hear the wind farms. Burcu: Sounds like an airplane. Ozgur: You hit it like this. Ozgur: Like this, you're going to stomp your foot up and down. Burcu: Listen to the sound, do you hear the crystal sounds? Ozgur: Yes. Ozgur: There is a lot of ice. Ozgur: But it looks beautiful. Burcu: Look over there. Ozgur: It's like a wing. Burcu: Layered, like a bird's wing. Burcu: I'm afraid of cutting my hand. Ozgur: Look at this. Ozgur: The top will come down. Burcu: I've been camping in nature for so many years, this is the first time I've seen something like this. Ozgur: You do the math on how cold it is. Burcu: Okay, I'll take it from here. Ozgur: No you can't. Come with me. Ozgur: It's like an ice invasion. Burcu: And yet there is life underneath. Ozgur: These have fallen off, see? Burcu: It's covered in layers of ice. Burcu: I can't move my face, I think it's frozen. Ozgur: It's so cold. Burcu: What? Ozgur: It looks good. Ozgur: Coffee smells so good. Burcu: It's delicious. Ozgur: I thought it was a rock. Ozgur: It's harder over there. Burcu: It got colder in the evening. Burcu: It's hot here. Burcu: If we do it here, the meat will freeze. Burcu: We have to bring it in as soon as it's cooked. Ozgur: Let's get this lit first. Burcu: Ozgur, where are you? Ozgur: Over here. Burcu: Look what's dripping from the stove. Burcu: Doesn't it burn from the wind? Burcu: Everything seems clearer now. Burcu: If one of these fell on our heads... Ozgur: It'll just hurt. Burcu: Are you sure? Burcu: I'll make caramelized onions. Ozgur: Is it ready? Ozgur: How much? Burcu: Put it more, it should be a little juicy. Burcu: Keep going. Ozgur: I'm gonna stir it up. Burcu: Whay do you say if we put the bread on the sides? Burcu: Oh. Burcu: It looks like a wet hamburger. Ozgur: It's quite wet. Burcu: Are you going to eat two of these? Burcu: Do you want to watch movies? Ozgur: What a view, isn't it beautiful? Ozgur: Look at this view. Ozgur: We have no luck with the drone. Burcu: Don't come in, let's wash our faces. Burcu: It looks hot but it's not hot at all. Ozgur: You can see everywhere. Burcu: Where should we wash it? Ozgur: Oh, it's freezing. Ozgur: What happened? Burcu: It's very hot. Burcu: Oh, my hand burned. Burcu: The weather is great. Ozgur: The sun was under the tree. Burcu: Did you see that... Burcu: I think a branch fell off either last night or this morning. Ozgur: I haven't seen it. Ozgur: I didn't go that way. Burcu: It fell off just now. Burcu: Look, this one just fell from the tree. Ozgur: Careful, you're right under it. Burcu: That one is also shaking, look. Ozgur: Come here, honey. Ozgur: See that granite rock, how huge it is? Ozgur: It's granite. Burcu: It's a cliff down there. Ozgur: Yes. Ozgur: Look at this, there's beech forest everywhere. Burcu: It's a green wood. Ozgur: Yes. Ozgur: It didn't withstand the weight of the ice. Ozgur: What a shame. Ozgur: And it's got lots of buds. Ozgur: It broke off right there. Ozgur: Do you hear that? Burcu: Your new crushing method is great. Burcu: Take a bread. It's nicely toasted. Burcu: Can I come in my slippers? Burcu: Looks like fox tracks. Burcu: Rabbit or fox? Burcu: It could be a rabbit. Burcu: We said there wouldn't be any animals, but apparently there are. Burcu: If those spikes hit you, they'll go through your head. Burcu: It's pretty sharp. Ozgur: I can get out, but it's hard for you to do it. Ozgur: You're buried, even though it's frozen. Burcu: Hold on. Burcu: My slipper is stuck there. Burcu: Now we know that you shouldn't wear slippers. Burcu: The snow has softened. Burcu: It was solid yesterday. Burcu: Come on, honey. Ozgur: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 floors. Burcu: Look at that branch, the tree is leaning. Burcu: It must have been heavy. Ozgur: It can't even move. Ozgur: These fell off, look. Probably from that. Burcu: It's good that it's falling off. Ozgur: I'm not. Ozgur: Follow my steps. Ozgur: Same again. Ozgur: Let me see that. Burcu: Come here. Burcu: That's what I meant. Burcu: Wheels are buried. Ozgur: We got stuck in a very bad place. Ozgur: Okay. Ozgur: Damn...
