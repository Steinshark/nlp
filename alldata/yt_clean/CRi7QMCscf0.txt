Hello and welcome to my kitchen. Let's dive into the recipe. Take 4 eggs and break them into a bowl. Eggs are a fantastic source of high-quality protein and essential nutrients. Now, add 1 teaspoon of salt. 1 teaspoon of black pepper. And 1 teaspoon of oregano. Mix everything together with a whisk until it's well combined. These seasonings not only add flavor but also have their own health benefits. For example, oregano is known for its antioxidant properties. Next, add 1 cup of cream. And 1 cup of milk to the bowl. Now, let's add a half cup of flour. And 1 tablespoon of baking powder. Stir the mixture until it's smooth and well blended. Cream and milk add a lovely richness to the dish, and they also provide calcium and vitamin D. This will give our casserole a nice, fluffy texture. Set this mixture aside for now. Now fill a saucepan with water. Friends, please write in the comments what country and city are you from? It's very nice to know that we can communicate all over the world! Add a pinch of salt. Stir well. And bring it to a boil. Once the water is boiling, add 8 ounces or 250 grams of pasta and cook it according to the package instructions until it's al dente. Pasta is a great source of carbohydrates, providing energy that we need to get through our day. While the pasta is cooking heat some olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Olive oil is a healthy fat, rich in monounsaturated fats and antioxidants. Finely chop one white onion. Did you know that onions have been used for their medicinal properties for thousands of years? They contain antioxidants and compounds that fight inflammation and reduce cholesterol levels. Add it to the pan. Saute the onion until it's translucent. Next, grate 2 cloves of garlic. Garlic is not only flavorful but also has numerous health benefits, including boosting the immune system and reducing blood pressure. Add them to the pan. Then, add 18 ounces or 500 grams of a mixture of ground pork and beef. This combination provides a good balance of flavors and nutrients, including iron and B vitamins. Cook this mixture for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the meat is browned and cooked through. Once the pasta is cooked, drain the water and transfer the pasta to a large bowl. Add to the ground meat in the pan 1 teaspoon of salt. 1 teaspoon of black pepper. And 1 teaspoon of oregano. Mix well and remove the pan from the heat. Add the cooked ground meat to the bowl with the pasta. Pour in 7 fluid ounces or 200 milliliters of tomato sauce. And mix everything together. Tomatoes are rich in vitamin C, potassium, and lycopene, an antioxidant that has been linked to many health benefits, including reduced risk of heart disease and cancer. Now, take a head of cheese, cut it in half. And grate one half. Add the grated cheese to the pasta mixture and stir well. Cheese adds a wonderful creamy texture and is a good source of calcium and protein. Take a baking dish and grease it with a little oil to prevent sticking. Pour the pasta and ground meat mixture into the dish and spread it out evenly. This is the base of our casserole, and it's already looking delicious! Now, let's prepare our vegetables. Heat some more olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Coarsely chop one red onion. Red onions have a milder flavor compared to white onions and are also high in antioxidants. Add it to the pan. Saute the onion until it's soft. Next, take 1 eggplant. Cut it into rings. Eggplants are low in calories but rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They are particularly high in antioxidants known as anthocyanins, which protect cells from damage. And then cut it into strips. Add the eggplant strips to the pan with the onion. Chop 2 sweet peppers. Bell peppers are high in vitamin C and antioxidants, which are great for your skin and immune system. Add them to the pan. Take 5 large champignon mushrooms. Chop them finely. Mushrooms are low in calories but rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. They're also a great source of fiber and protein. And add them to the pan as well. Finally, add 14 ounces or 400 grams of chopped tomatoes from a jar to the pan. Stir everything together. And season with 1 teaspoon of salt. 1 teaspoon of black pepper. And 1 teaspoon of oregano. Let the vegetables simmer for about 10 minutes until they are tender and well combined. Transfer the cooked vegetables from the frying pan into the baking dish on top of the pasta and ground meat mixture. Pour the egg mixture we prepared earlier over the vegetables. This will help bind everything together and add a lovely richness to the dish Grate the remaining half of the cheese. And sprinkle it generously over the top of the casserole. Preheat your oven to 360 degrees Fahrenheit or 180 degrees Celsius. Place the casserole in the oven and bake for 30 minutes until the top is golden brown and bubbly. While our casserole is baking, cut 6 cherry tomatoes into halves. Cherry tomatoes are sweet and juicy, adding a burst of freshness to the dish. Once the casserole is done, take it out of the oven and let it cool slightly. Make cuts in the casserole to make it easier to serve later, creating approximately 12 servings. Place a cherry tomato half on each serving. Finely chop a small bunch of green onions to sprinkle on top. Green onions add a nice crunch and a mild, fresh flavor.
