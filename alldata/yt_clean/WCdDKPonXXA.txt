[upbeat jazzy music] - Greetings and welcome to what I hope is a at least unused-in-box Yeah, we've got an AST maybe early '96, one of their Yeah, in particular, it from late 1995, I believe. And these are the kind Look at this stuff. eight megs of RAM, 850-meg hard drive, a 3 and a half inch 1.44-meg floppy, a four-speed CD-ROM, I don't know if it's integrated or if it's a dedicated card or what. Microphone and speakers a mouse too. The monitor was a separate purchase. PCI local bus video with And of course: Windows 95, this being a rather early '95 machine. Plus a whole bunch of one of the bigger selling Really, everybody who in the PC market back in increasing amounts. And while I'm not sure of the exact price of the 622 model here, I do know that the very in the fall of 1995. Really nothing ridiculous in or the very lowest end either. It's just kinda like a And the fact that it's of course, highly appealing. And you know, this is because an LGR viewer pointing out that this was albeit opened by the seller to make sure everything But yeah, the price was a bit high, so I made a lower best offer. And well, they accepted, so here we are. And if you see the chapters below, you'll see we'll be opening this thing up and then opening it up, you know? I wanna see on the inside, too, to make sure there's no corrosion or ghosts or anything inside. And then we'll get it set if we're able to do that. And yeah, before that, I just wanna go over a little bit of brief computer and because the AST Advantage of computers for a while, alongside the Bravo series these just being their primary desktops, available as a desktop or a tower, even a few all-in-one models. And these were sold through and distributors like and stores like Incredible and many more. starting in 1994, which makes sense, seeing as AST had acquired the of Radio Shack's parent company, Tandy, for $112 million in 1993. Around the same time, they [chortles] They were really and then it all came crashing down. But let's go back to the because AST Computer, was founded in 1980 in Irvine, California, so pretty early to the whole And they primarily sold and compatibles from 1981 to '86, with the AST SixPak multifunction cards being the most well-known And honestly, it probably still is, at least in my experience. But yeah, they were the behind only IBM and Compaq by 1988, and they held onto that In the early to mid '90s, And they fought hard mainly against Compaq and IBM, trying to undercut on prices and options and things like that, going with Compaq, especially, in the 486 era. But they just couldn't keep with their whole supply And as a result, AST tried to do things like emphasizing workstations and laptops and 24/7 technical support But yeah, the competition quality control decreased, and things kinda fell I mean, in 1995, when this they were still the fifth in the world, but their revenue overall was hardly rising anymore, and their losses were in They were really on a downward trend, and they sold out completely in 1997 to large company shareholder Samsung, who closed them down in 1999, being sold off to somebody else. So in a way, this Advantage 622 was really from AST's malaise era, I guess you could call it, where their PCs and the company itself were on a steady decline on all fronts. So wow, I can't wait to dive in! I mean it, I really can't. You never know what you're gonna find especially supposedly So let's just go right for it. [jazz continues over unboxing sounds] [chuckling] Oh, I love these things. Yeah, these kinds of posters I remember my Acer Aspire came or something kinda like it. &quot;Congratulations. You're the proud owner I sure hope so. Look at this roadmap. What a sleek-looking rear-end First the monitor, then then your phone, then the then the keyboard, the Hey, we got another... Oh, dude, there we go, So once you get it all plugged in, we have a startup thing here. I hope that that's still doable. That'd be awesome. If this really hasn't we should be seeing this. [jazz music continues] Mm. All kinds of accessories, mouse, a blank envelope. Guess that's if you need to &quot;Register now,&quot; the customer care program. Yeah, they are pretty well known for this. 24/7, 7 days a week, you could get help or at least talk to David Murray. Got some installation &quot;A few of the educational game CD-ROMs that came with it need Well, yeah. Another addendum. &quot;Includes a voice-capable modem. Your computer has two MIC connections.&quot; Oh yeah, don't plug it into the wrong one. Modem has one. Mic has one, I guess. Intriguingly, these do say 1996 on them. So perhaps this was made than I thought. Everything I've read seems to That's certainly feasible Just get everything outta here. All right, keyboard time. Well, that is a very but [laughing] about what I'd expect. Oh yeah. [keys clacking] Honestly, not the worst [keys clacking] Still feels like rubber domes, Huh! Well, look at that. We got some little green But yeah, it's just definitely But they got a nice spring to them. [keys clacking] And honestly, [laughing] I [keys clacking] It reminds me of what Packard Oh, a lovely beige AC six volt, 400 milliamp, center negative. Oh, ho-ho these are classics, dude! I have not seen these in a long time, Labtec LCS-150s. Dude, I have a couple of Labtecs that are very close to this, but not this exact, [speakers clacking] We got our bass boost that I mean, it tries. We do have a real volume knob. Our cables are just these are those you can or plug straight into the You plug them into the with the amplification on your sound card. They'll work just fine. I gotta say, I'm kinda disappointed it doesn't come with those. I was really hoping for that I've never seen or had those before. It's just a different look to them. Rodent time. Oh! This kinda looks used. Look at that. We got It's kinda what that Yeah, and some dirt on the bottom. It's definitely been used, so maybe the peripherals were used. Maybe it was all used and the seller was just Anyway, yeah, a standard [mouse button clicking] It's honestly fine. It's a I've got a few of these. All right, so we got our We will not be using that today. [chuckling] And would you look at that. How many of you had a microphone that looked like this back in the day? I know just about everyone, dude, that I knew from like 1993 to '98. All right, power cord. I got a thousand of these, so I'm not even gonna And finally, our package Oh, I really hope that it's all in here. Ooh, we're looking promising so far. Oh, yeah. I'm so glad these We have our Restore Disk 1995 on these. We'll definitely be archiving these. Look at the combo software things. So we have [laughing] the &quot;Family I remember we had a copy of that. &quot;What is a Bellybutton?&quot; and some, like, edutainment-looking stuff, &quot;Eco: East Africa&quot; and... Oh no, just the virtual simulation It's just one thing on this one. All kinds of stuff in Oh, interesting. So this is a little instead of the ones it shows on the other printout and stuff. So I guess they just That happened, for sure. &quot;You need America Online.&quot; I sure did back then. 15 hours free in a month, oh my goodness. &quot;Software is on your hard drive.&quot; Some more information about, So many ads. &quot;I was afraid of learning software.&quot; And I talked to this lady in a little screen on my screen, Okay. More stuff. More addendums, oh my goodness. &quot;Stop. Don't throw it away.&quot; CompuServe, Prodigy, good grief. They just partnered with everyone, just every single financial incentive to include all these things. [cackling] Lotus SmartSuite, all Ooh, we got a disk, &quot;Hard A one-year limited warranty, Certificate of Authenticity The little baby in the hologram. And the last two, just some documentation for that &quot;Eco: East educational something-or-other, and a Advantage 600 Series user's manual, minus all the addendums, But hey, most of this will be correct. Ah, yes. I was wondering how this might come apart, because that is our next thing [jazz music continues] Well, that sure is pretty. It's in good shape, but it is not unused, as if the accessories didn't give it away. But yeah, just, you can see where our That's where the feet were. Somebody would do that, just go onto the Internet and tell lies? I sure am glad I put in a best offer and didn't pay full price. I did get a pretty decent discount, so you know, still happy with it so far 'cause it really is like-new condition, all things considered. I mean, it barely looks touched. If anything, I mean, it and then never turned on. We still don't know yet. I guess, kinda doesn't 'cause it's definitely been Still looks great, So a game port right there, looks like a secondary serial port would be potentially there. We got our modem with the your regular audio stuff, with a little plug over this microphone. They really didn't want you [laughing] Parallel, other serial, PS/2 So this all appears to be integrated except for just this, probably. And you know, that's a so it's looking good. 325-watt AT power supply, I'm assuming. [button clicking] It's got the hard on/off over there. Now, at least that little is still very much on there. It doesn't look like that's [grunts] So perhaps we to go inside. Oh, neat. We got a sticker on the That's handy. Okay, let us get this sucker open, make sure it's all good in there. I do not know what kind [screwdriver clicking] [jazz music continues] There we go, looking clean as expected. There's a date code right on the case. May 1st, 1996, so I Machine was introduced at the end of '95, but this one was put together in '96. And check it out. Lovely-looking little thing inside. Kinda reminds me of certain HP machines with the Vectra line. There's a look at our Great to see a proper two-inch not some little piezoelectric thingy. And yeah, it's got one of those dual-sided riser things in here. So we do have PCI in And so you have some cards this way, some cards going that way, and just sort of crisscrossing back and forth. Got our cute little RAM modules in there, our rather substantial Oh, hey, and check this out. See those empty sockets right there? Those are actually for So there's one megabyte for but if you have the right memory chips, you can double that to two megs. Pretty handy. Oh, and there we go. That's really the main thing was the battery. Just wanted to make sure and not a leaky barrel. Yeah, so it looks like, and two PCI slots on the riser there. I'm assuming this is for What kind of motherboard is this? FM561, no kidding. [laughing] You know how I said Yeah, it's an FM561 by HP. I guess my first inkling was correct. This really does look it's got a pretty decent That is an ESS AudioDrive, a 1788F. And you got a wavetable header there. And I've had good luck with these in terms of, like, DOS compatibility and general Windows 95 decency. Let's take a look at that thermal compound, you never know. [jazz music continues] Oh, it's one of those to the heat sink. Yeah, there we go, delightful I'm always iffy about of this type of thing 'cause almost cement-like. And leave it on there for now. But we can definitely take care of that thermal grease [laughing] This is, It's so stuck on there. [sighing] All right. [grunts] Well, get all of our and power this sucker on. See what we got going or at least the initial startup for us. [jazz music concludes] Okay, all set up and looking lovely. By the way, I did give it just to get that tiny bit There wasn't much, but I want my grime on there, and that's it. So now it'll be my grime from here onward. But yeah, let's go ahead [button clicks] [fans whirring] [hard disk whirs to life] [hard disk self-check noises] Yeeeah! All right! Y'know, I should've Didn't even think about it! [computer beeps twice] Okay, um... Yeah, CMOS battery is dead. Let's just see if it Ah, okay. Yeah. Okay. Well, let me get that I'm gonna go through the BIOS and make sure it's and we'll go from there. [claps] Good start though! Alrighty so, BIOS [button clicks] And we are now as well as our settings and stuff. [hard disk chirping] And yeah, that delightful hard disk, it automatically detected as And it just has that Eight megs of RAM tested and working. Yeah. I's been a long time since with just eight megs of RAM, So anyway, since the hard disk I am hoping it's all good. [hard drive creaks along] Yeah! Oh wow, okay, that went away quicker than I thought it would. There was a little custom AST logo. Oh dude. Well, this is unique. Love that little custom So home or office use or in-store display? Yeah, &quot;One-time choice only. You'll not be returned to this screen.&quot; So either this really has not been used or it was just restored who sold it to me, and they and got it back to this. Either way, we should have a You know, looking back at that poster where it shows the startup process, it does say that this is you run into, so yeah, pretty authentic. Let's just do home/office. Yes. Ooh. &quot;Hi, we're here, on behalf to welcome you and get acquainted and I took too long to read it. [laughing] I adjusted the camera, and... It kinda makes me wonder if there's supposed to be sound there. I think the speakers are And oh, it's actually gonna ask for our Certificate of Authenticity. Let me find that. [grunts] Anybody remember what the code was? Ah, here we go. A bit of a more lengthy loading process, as I was anticipating. Love that &quot;AST Computer OEM splash screens, mm. That hard disk is going to town. [hard disk clicking] Wow. Hm, slightly customized We got some different things it's adding for all the AST stuff. It actually lists AST Works and the other programs that Speaking of which, we got AST Works II, which I believe is their type of thing. Oh, finally, been sitting All right, lets you register. Ah, [laughing] well. [Windows 95 startup music] That is what's up. [chuckles] Just the most basic Windows 95. Wow. This very clean, all things considered. They got rid of a lot of the and you just have AST Registration. Oh, wait. Nope, it's still going. - And now you can start you bought your computer for. Let's show you around a bit. - A new era begins. Windows 95, a powerful new - The new AST interface packs into one tiny bubble anywhere you want. - And you get a choice between, has changed from open to locked- - Click the locking button again. - All the quadrants open and close. - Let's go ahead and lock the toolbar. Below the toolbar is Ask AST- - Put your most important [Clint exhales in boredom] of buttons that provide - [Clint] ALL RIGHT! [lively synth ditty plays] Oh my goodness, we got this little Spot. [menus hissing and clicking] I'm, oh man, not a fan. I never like these little pop-up deals that are just, like, always there. Fresh Windows 95 experience here. 4.00.950, this is just We probably don't have any Nope, although we do have XingMPEG. [laughing] What is that? &quot;Zing?&quot; I'm assuming that's &quot;crossing.&quot; Oh dear. Whoa! [dramatic synth music] That? Oh. [dramatic synth music] [synth music glitching] It's trying. [laughing] Okay. We have our SiS chipset Yeah, don't even let you You just have to do it through here. Oh, hey, we got some IRQ 5, DMA 1, 330, 388, 220 for all the I/O settings That'll be great in DOS. Wonder if it comes to any cool wallpapers. That's a big old nope, at least in the Windows directory. So we'll just go with Clouds, I guess. Yeah, one of the most enjoyable things of any OEM kind of setup like this is seeing what all is installed. And goodness, there is a lot. [laughing] AST Extras, AST Works II! Oh my, all the early AOL, CompuServe, of course, Got your Internet browser Syncro Multimedia Connect, or AST LifeLine. I'm assuming tech support or something. Well, there's an encyclopedia Lotus SmartSuite, we pretty standard accessories other than a couple shortcuts added. Yeah, some different just dropped in here. It's already got QuickTime [laughing] Yeah, let's go. Typically, you have to get this off of the Windows 95 CD-ROM yourself. [hovercraft whooshing] [energetic synth music] Oh boy. [power-up ringing] [laughing] Yeah, the performance isn't amazing, but that's to to be expected. [playful, mischievous music] Completely. [hovercraft bonking] [laughing] 100-megahertz Pentium. Yeah. [urgent, playful music] And hear our delightful Good example of that. [reverse pad whooshing] [hovercraft bonking] [mischievous music] All right, well, that's &quot;Hover!&quot; That's awesome. Nice that that's already I don't think I've seen that Yeah, there is a lot on this drive. They have loaded this thing down. Volume_1. Yeah, there's only 342 megs left. We do have our Media folder populated. Ah, let's go with &quot;Passport.&quot; [suave jazz music] Yeah, dude. [laughing] I don't know. I've always found the way these it's fascinating, you know? It's not exactly like OPL2 or I don't know. It's Goodness, there's so many things on here. [laughing] And if I were to use this I would be clearing stuff off of here. But obviously, that's not the goal. I wanted to use this as it Okay, let's see here. What have we got in these AST Extras? Home Inventory, what is that? It's exactly what it sounded like. I'm assuming most of these are gonna be the same type of thing. Yeah, just not much going on there. All right, this is kinda cool. &quot;Area Mathcard calculates square inches, square centimeters, square feet.&quot; Yeah, there we go. AST Works II, let's see What's Getting Started? I got a DESKTOP TOUR. There's that GREETINGS MOUSE TIPS, MY HARDWARE. [laughing] What? &quot;Chips, fast processor, lots mass media, large hard drive, multimedia, information not available.&quot; That is the most useless system DESKTOP TOUR, let's see what this is. We got more talking people? - When you click- - On the button labeled TOUR, Getting Started will appear to close. Simply click on the button located on the Windows 95 taskbar. [laughing] - She looked down. [laughing] What? Oh my goodness, the multimedia age. You know, we gotta just because. I was expecting more of like a TabWorks or even, like, ACE Desktop or Packard Bell Navigator Let's see what this Talk Shop is, mm. Oh, look at this. Blockbuster Music, AST LifeLine's in here, 1-800-Flowers, Wells Fargo. Ah, man. I wanna call and listen. [error dinging] Even had games! Frick. Ugh! Multiplayer Battleship, dude. Well, we can't talk to anybody online, but we can't at least test that seemingly everyone had. I know it's not great, This is a test to reveal just [static crackling] to reveal just how awful this really is. - Perfect. Wouldn't have it any other way. All right, what about some Let's try this encyclopedia. I didn't see a CD-ROM for it, so I'm assuming it's just Guess not. Yeah, no CD. It didn't come with Yeah, there was just these four. And I did look through this Restore Disk just to make sure there was But nope, it's just what you would think, data for restoring the So yeah, it's just these four May as well check out our optical drive and see if it's working. It opens somewhat slowly, but that's okay. Let's try this Data Disk. [relaxed jazz music] Just a bunch of AV video files. Huh. - It's important to because dust and dirt can Keeping your computer clean around your computer. - [Clint] So yeah, I guess - MPC means Multimedia PC. - [Clint] Wow. - [Clint] Just delightful videos. - Marketing Council sets The latest standard is MPC- - [Clint] Well, I'll put if you wanna view those yourself. Okay, let's give &quot;Eco: [energetic drum music] [sighs] Well, I think something's broken. Maybe it needs to be in 256 colors. [energetic drum music] Okay, well, now we're seeing things. So, oh yeah, this looks Let's see. What do we got here? We can just click on places and go there? Hm. [insects singing] [frogs croaking] I think that's a giraffe. Oh, it's 3:00 a.m. [laughing] What the heck? Interesting. I don't know This is not what I expected, exactly. Interesting. It's like a virtual tour of this park and, like, some kind of [laughing] Wow. This actually might Like, what the heck? Oh, it's getting lighter. [birds chirping] This is kinda cool. I don't know what's going on, [laughing] Watching the virtual This is great. We can just like move around from block to block or whatever. But, oh crap, nah, I didn't Well, I'm intrigued a lot by that. Yeah, it was like a first-person All right, and since it's our last disc, since I guess we just &quot;Family Health Book&quot; and I don't know. I've always wondered. So hopefully, we'll learn. [uplifting music] Yeah! Mayonnaise Clinic. Let's go. Gimme some Duke's. Make me a sandwich. Yeah, I know you're not So yeah, this is different than the one I would've messed It would've been like 1997, probably, whatever version that would've been. But yeah, same kind of stuff. It's just like one of those I remember, you know, It was like, &quot;Oh no, what This is like WebMD But you could also look up- - [Narrator] Kidney stone lithotripsy- - [Clint] Oh. - Yeah, this kind of stuff. Parent program, that's for grownups. Ah, let's see. The other thing, though, what these bellybutton thangs are. - [Narrator] This CD-ROM - [Clint] Plus Program - [Narrator] Features of - [Clint] Locked-off content on disc. So you've got the program here. It's- - [Narrator] &quot;What is a Bellybutton?&quot; - [Clint] Yeah, presumably, all there. You call, pay, and get a- - [Narrator] Look on the Main Menu- - Wow. Bet you could That's fascinating. - [Narrator] Here we go! [cereal crunching] - Why do I get hungry? - [Narrator] When you feel your body is telling you it's time to eat. - [Clint] That guy sounds really familiar. So this is like a animated - [Narrator] Your body is like a car. - This is interesting, but it's still not telling I still don't know. [car engine revving] Learning about cars, though. [cereal crunching] - [Child] Cereal is made from grain. - Ah, here we go. We got [musical notes ascending] - [Child] Fresh fruit has lots of vitamin. - Thought she was gonna say vitamin C. That was a C scale. Anyway... - There's my friend Kenny. [chuckling] [slide whistle tooting] - All right. Kenny done screwed up. - What happens when you break a bone? - [Clint] You end up like Kenny. A broken husk of a child. Well, that's enough screwing around. Time to install something of my own. All right, well, this is due to the very nature of As admirably period correct it kinda means you can't do much, and a lot of my go-to games So for instance, the with something like &quot;Need for which [chuckles] just is UbiSoft's &quot;POD&quot; refuses to even install due to the lack of RAM. 10 is the minimum, and &quot;Age of Empires,&quot; same thing. It needs 16 megs minimum. &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 2&quot; gives a similar effect of graphical nonsense as It's just garbage. Even &quot;Quake&quot; won't start, instead crashing with a Clearly, we need to just use some SoftRAM. &quot;Double your memory.&quot; Yeah, Why not? Infamous scam there. Anyway, no. So we're just gonna be that it actually can play, [epic orchestral music] Yeah, dude. [water bubbling] Hmm. Already at a river, huh? Let's just ford it. Ah. Tragedy struck. Clean it up. We lost a 38 pounds of bacon gone. [epic orchestral music] So yeah, this kind of thing is, [laughing] oh man, brings back memories, you know, playing on just your You can do all kinds of Double, triple, quadruple the RAM. I think it sports up to 128 megs. Obviously, that'd make a big difference, and lighten up the swap file every time you try to do anything. But no, I'm gonna leave it as is. I don't have too many [laughing] Like I said, it brings back of just, like, playing and you dealt with it. You know, a 100-megahertz Pentium is fine. You could drop a bunch of Add cache, a L2 cache slot is there. And of course, let's try to ford again. There's the video memory as well. There's only one megabyte on board, and there's those sockets But even then, you know, that's not gonna make this thing scream. But, oh no! Well, I guess my trailgoers [laughing] Another that is, of course, is &quot;Raptor,&quot; a classic DOS shareware game, &quot;Call of the Shadows.&quot; [upbeat synth music] Yeah, good to hear some of that interesting ESS FM synth as well. But yeah, if you just as like a, you know, [chuckles] less a Pentium, Windows which it is, but think about [gunshots booming] And yeah, I mean, it's DOS games, especially [laughing] There's a whole bunch there to play with, and it'll pretty much all run just fine. [cheerful synth music] This game is awesome. [chuckling] [rockets whooshing] [gunshots booming] Well, anyway, yeah, in terms of DOS stuff, it's pretty darn capable, like I said. And you know, the fact that in terms of the sound chip is great. I mean, it's already set to pretty much what Sound Blaster, AdLib compatible for music, and the Sound Blaster 220, 5, 1 kind of settings. It just thinks it's a Sound Blaster. Naturally, this also means [explosion glitching] Well, you know. [laughing] Maybe it's not such a great choice. [cackling] That was about the laggiest I've seen that introduction ever. Okay. Oh, this poor lack of RAM, that swap file, and the hard disk and just I'm sure, once it gets things- - [Duke] Damn, those alien for shooting up my ride. - Loaded, that it's [gunshot booming] [Duke grunts] [alien groans] [explosion booming] [explosion booming] [laser blooping] [explosion booming] - [Clint As Duke] Even [lasers blooping] - [Duke] See you in hell. [gunshots banging] [alien groans] [chortling] [gunshots banging] Oh boy! [Duke grunts] Interesting dips and spikes- [Duke grunts] In performance. [Duke grunts] [alien groans] Anytime it's trying to, or sound effects, that's [gunshots banging] [laughing] To really chug. I feel ya, Duke. This is sad. Oh! [gun clicking] Yeah, that's... Wow. Well, all right. Well, never mind. I mean, this is playable, but [alert chiming] [triumphant horns blaring] All right, restarted. Let's see how this goes. - [Duke] Damn, those alien for shooting up my ride. [gunshots banging] Ugh. - [Duke] Cool. - It might be nominally better. [aliens groaning] - [Duke] I'm gonna put - Let's say it's nominally better. [gunshots banging] Yeah, it's definitely improved, I guess. [laughing] I don't know. It's hard to tell. Things loaded into virtual memory, maybe. [alien groaning] Obviously, it would also be improved with more of the L2 cache or just, you know, that Like I said, it's fascinating going back to this kind of experience, you forget with, like, every is just so upgraded and optimized that it's like, you know, sort of the peak of what it would've been back in the day, whereas this is just [laughing] middle-of-the-road And yeah, on that note, how &quot;Quake&quot; is a good test. Like I said, the DOS for whatever reason. &quot;WinQuake,&quot; on the other hand, ah? Yeah. Well, here we go. [overlapping voices whispering] All right, well... [laughing] Here's &quot;Quake,&quot; such as it is, running on a 100-megahertz and one-megabyte integrated graphics chip. Yeah. [whistles] [chuckling] Another one of those where, once things load for the first it does get smoother. [ammo clicking] Honestly, pretty playable, [soldier groaning and screaming] [ammo clicking] At least when there's only [doors whooshing] [soldiers grunting] [dog barking and whimpering] [ammo clicks] You know, not the worst I've seen, but [laughing] not the [dog barking] Late '95, whatever. [ammo clicks] [Nailgun clicking] Definitely one of those machines that kind of just exemplifies- [soldier groaning] You know, it's obsolete out of the parking lot to take home. [chuckles] [Nailgun pattering] Yeah. [gunshots banging] Ooh, boy. [ammo clicking] It's holding up a little [gunshots banging] [dog whimpering] Yeah, those groups of dudes here at the end always make this chug, but... [gunshots banging] Not as much chugging as I thought. Honestly, [laughing] &quot;Duke And because this is the original &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; for DOS. [dramatic orchestral music] Heck yeah, the interlaced streaming straight off of the CD, putting that quad-speed drive to work, all four of those Xs doing their thing. FMV. All right, let's get to the game. See those polygons in all their glory. [chilling, suspenseful music] There we go. You can count those pixels. [laughing] So yeah, another but perhaps not the most. [arrows whooshing] Well, I don't know. It's accurate to the time. If you didn't have any kind of then this is probably how you played it. That's not the right button. [Lara grunts] Reminds me of going to, like, and they had this going, and- [gunshots banging] It ran like crap. Didn't care, thought it looked amazing. Yeah, way beyond anything I so yeah, whatever. Performance? [blows raspberry] I didn't really know what that was. Oh yeah. Let's get into [gunshots banging] [chuckling] Well, anyway, gaming in 1996. Ah, yeah, this is pretty And I think that is having a computer around that of what a bunch of people had. I admit, a lot of my enjoyment is to experience the or very rarely did, you know, the really costly, rigs that I could only dream However, there's definitely that I'm finding in the especially when it's in I'm still a little bummed it's that it was supposed to come with, and it has definitely been used. Wasn't exactly new as I was It's really a treat to go back and experience this kind of thing again, because it really is kinda rare these days that I actually go back to try that was slow even when it came out. Like I said, that's kinda the stuff that I was more familiar with a computer that was that it was a computer, [laughing] not because it was the fastest or any kind of performant, really.
