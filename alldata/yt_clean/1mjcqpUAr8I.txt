JOYCE: WELL, YOU KNOW, HOW I HAD NO REASON MY MINISTRY WAS DOING I HAD A GOOD HUSBAND, DIDN'T HAVE ANY AND YET I WASN'T HAPPY. AND IT SEEMED LIKE THERE I WAS ALWAYS DISCONTENTED AND KIND OF LIKE THIS AND WHEN I STARTED GOD JUST SPOKE TO MY HEART, BECAUSE YOU'RE SELFISH.&quot; SO, I KIND OF PREACH WAY HE GIVES IT TO ME. BUT WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL A SELFISH ATTITUDE WITH GOD. YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT REALLY YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T SEND YES, HE WANTS US TO BE HAPPY. BUT IT'S-- IT'S LIKE WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE, BUT NOW, I DON'T WANT THEM EVERY TO WANT SOMETHING. I WANT THEM TO COME JUST TO SAY, &quot;ANYTHING YOU NEED ME TO DO?&quot; GOD'S THE SAME WAY. WE COME TO A POINT IN OUR WE NEED TO BE MATURE ENOUGH LIST OF EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED OTHERWISE, WE'RE JUST, DO THIS ANYMORE, GOD, AND SO, I JUST--I THINK THAT SELFISHNESS IN THE WORLD, AND IT GETS--SLIDES OVER AND, YOU KNOW, &quot;ANYONE WHO WANTS LET HIM TAKE UP HIS AND WE'RE MIXED UP ABOUT IT'S NOT DISASTERS AND, KIND OF MIS-- LOSE SIGHT OF YOURSELF AND ALL YOUR CROSS AND FOLLOW ME.&quot; IS TO LIVE AN UNSELFISH LIFE. AND THAT'S A DAILY COMMITMENT GINGER: YEAH. IT'S SO CONTRARY YOU KNOW, THAT WHOLE IDEA OF JOYCE: RIGHT. GINGER: SO, IT TAKES A LOT OF PRACTICE. IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK. IT'S NOT EASY. ERIN: I WONDER YOU TELL ME. IS THAT DIFFICULT FOR YOU-- I WONDER YOU AS WELL, SUCH AMAZING-- CAREERS AND YOU'VE HAD SUCH THAT PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR TO LEARN FROM YOU. IT WOULD BE SO EASY, BECAUSE YOU COULD. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? AND YOU ARE BOTH THE MOST SO, HOW DO YOU KEEP THAT ON A DAILY BASIS? 'CAUSE YOU MAKE IT SOUND EASY. JOYCE: WELL, CECE. ERIN: SHE PASSED THAT CECE: WELL-- CECE: WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THIS INCREDIBLE WOMAN OF GOD. HEARING THE TEACHINGS YOU READ THE WORD, IN READING THE WORD, &quot;HALLELUJAH.&quot; CECE: YOU KNOW GINGER: YEAH.

YOU CAN DO IT, JOYCE. IF ANYBODY CAN DO IT, BECAUSE THAT IS, LIKE SHE SAID, AND IT'S AN HONOR BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S EASY. ERIN: RIGHT. CECE: BUT WHEN YOU BEGIN WHEN YOU BEGIN TO CRUCIFY YOU DO BEGIN TO DEVELOP GINGER: YEAH. CECE: AND SO, BUT IT NEVER FEELS GOOD. ERIN: SURE. CECE: I DON'T THINK YOU EVER WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE GETTING WISER. GINGER: I LIKE THE WAY ERIN: DEFINITELY WISDOM. CECE: GETTING WISER. IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU LOOK BUT YOU LOOK FORWARD JOYCE: RIGHT. CECE: YOU KNOW, SPEAKING EARLIER, YOU MATURE. ERIN: YEAH.

GINGER: IT'S THE WAY IT'S THAT UPSIDE DOWN LOVE. THE MORE WE LOVE OTHERS, IN OUR LIFE. AND YEAH, IT'S KIND OF SHOCKING. JOYCE: WELL, GOD WANTS 'EM DONE, BUT WHEN WE TRY TO TAKE CARE ERIN: NO, IT DOESN'T. GINGER: I HAVE SO MANY JOYCE: I REALIZED, ONE TIME, AND FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, GOD WILL ANOINT ME TO HELP YOU. CECE: WOW. JOYCE: AND MIGHT ANOINT THE SAME PROBLEM I'VE GOT. SO, WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT? WELL, IT'S VERY SIMPLE. GOD CALLED US TO REACH THAT'S--WE'RE SOWING OUR SEED. AND THEN HE BRINGS THE HARVEST BUT WE CAN'T--WE JUST SIMPLY WE CAN'T MAKE OURSELVES HAPPY. WE CAN'T-- IS YOU GIVE AWAY, YOU SOW, AND I THINK, PEOPLE HAVE A LOT AND WE HAVE THIS SILLY IDEA WE'VE GOTTA ISOLATE OURSELVES WOUNDS AND, YOU KNOW, ANYTHING FOR ANYBODY I'VE GOT THIS PROBLEM.&quot; TO REACH OUT TO OTHER PEOPLE, LIFE IS WHEN YOU ARE HURTING, REALLY NEED GOD TO BRING AND TO ME, WHEN YOU WANNA THAT-- AND YOU KNOW, IT'S PRAYING FOR PEOPLE. IT'S FORGIVING PEOPLE. IT'S BEING MERCIFUL TO PEOPLE. IT'S HELPING PEOPLE IN NEED. IT'S GIVING BEYOND WHAT'S IT'S--YOU KNOW, THEY TELL US WHAT THEY AND WE NEED TO BE LISTENING ERIN: WHICH GOES AGAINST JOYCE: RIGHT. ERIN: THAT'S JUST TELLS US WE SHOULD BE DOING. BECAUSE, &quot;I SHOULD AND, &quot;HOW CAN I GET AHEAD?&quot; TAKE CARE OF YOU,&quot; JOYCE: WELL, AND THE WORLD &quot;YOU DESERVE IT.&quot; YOU KNOW, YOU-- GOD SPOKE TO MY HEART, ASKING HIM TO HELP SOMEBODY. HE SAID, &quot;WILL YOU STOP ASKING COULD EASILY DO AND JUST ERIN: YEAH. CECE: AH, I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. BECAUSE HE SPEAKS THAT CLEAR. JOYCE: RIGHT. CECE: YOU KNOW, THE SCRIPTURE THAT SAYS, LIKE OUR WAYS.&quot; ERIN: NO, THEY'RE NOT. CECE: TOTALLY DIFFERENT TO FEED YOURSELF TO EMBRACE THE TEACHINGS OTHER ANOINTED PEOPLE. BECAUSE REALLY PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT. IT'S LIKE THEY SPENT A FEW AND THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING THE REST OF THE WEEK THAT BECAUSE WE'RE SO TOTALLY YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE TO FEED JOYCE: RIGHT. CECE: MEDITATE ON IT. HANG OUT WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE ALL OF THAT HELPS YOU. JOYCE: AND DO IT. CECE: AND DO IT. RIGHT, YOU HAVE TO DO IT. YOU HAVE TO WALK IN OBEDIENCE. JOYCE: THAT'S THE KEY, NOT JUST HEAR IT. YOU GOTTA DO IT. CECE: THAT'S RIGHT. GINGER: I THINK THAT'S IS NOTICING WHO YOU'RE NOTICING WHO YOU'RE LEARNING ARE YOU GROWING? CECE: ARE YOU GROWING? GINGER: YEAH, OF SOMETHING ELSE FOR IS THAT WALK CLOSER TO JESUS, BUT IT REALLY IS, TO KNOW HIM BETTER? AM I SHARING MYSELF WITH HIM?&quot; ABOUT WHO HE IS?&quot; IT'S LIKE-- &quot;SUPER SPIRITUAL.&quot; GINGER: WE DO. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE. BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE FEEL LIKE CECE: NO, IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT OVER YOUR HEAD WHEN WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ON OUR OWN. WHAT WE DO IS &quot;FILTHY RAGS,&quot; BUT WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT-- THAT A LOT OVER THE YEARS WHERE AS SUPER SPIRITUAL WHEN TELLS US TO DO. GINGER: RIGHT, YEAH. JOYCE: RIGHT.
