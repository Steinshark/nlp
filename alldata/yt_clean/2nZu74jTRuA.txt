Otherwise, it's time for lockdown. Okay, I'll give you a ride. Yeah, okay. Thanks for the ride. I'm going in first. Shen Nanyin, what did you do at school? Your reputation is ruined. How can the Gu family still want you? A daughter-in-law like you. Come home with me now. Tomorrow, we'll discuss your marriage with Mr. Chen. Mr. Chen? He's 50 years old. He could be my father. How can a father be so heartless? There's something else That If you want to consider If you want to consider a fake marriage partner. You can think about it. Me? Marriage is no small thing. I know you got married I know you got married because your mother wanted you to. Actually, I'm in a difficult position in the Shen family. My father is marrying me tomorrow My dad is marrying me off to a 50-year-old businessman tomorrow. That's why Marrying you It's the best choice I've ever made. You're quite honest. So if I want more Not just a marriage of consent. What if it's a de facto marriage? What does he mean? He means he wants me to give myself. But I won't force you. Think about it. I've got no choice. There's no turning back. Even if the road ahead is thorny Mr. Lu I agree I never thought I'd just marry a strange man I got married on the spur of the moment I'll keep this I'll keep this. Let's go. I'll take you somewhere. Where? You'll see. Say something nice. Still need to talk about ah I didn't see this girl at school How with Mr. Lu together Mr. Lu suddenly contacted me today Will not be looking at her right Why is the father here? Don't say anything.

I never would have passed it on to him. I can give you the S2 program. But I have a request. Just say it. I want Shen Nanyin I want her to sever all ties with the Shen family. I'm counting on Shen Nanyin Shen Nanyin to climb the money tree of Lu Jingyan. To benefit the Shen family. If we break off the relationship. I'll have lost all my hopes. But I can't openly refuse Mr. Lu. I'm afraid that's not right Besides Yum Yum, you wouldn't agree either Isn't that right? I agree What did you say? I agree to sever ties with the Shen family. If that's the case. Mr. Liu. Take Mr. Shen to sign the contract. Yes, sir. This way, Mr. Shen. Mr. Shen. Mr. Shen. What are you two waiting for? Let's go. To get rid of the Shen family. I sold myself I sold myself to Lu Jingyan. I don't know if it's right. What should I do? The Shen family sold you to me. You're now completely mine. Did you do it on purpose? Why did you do it? Mrs. Lu Welcome to a new life Come home with me Help! Are we really going to sleep together? Come here. I'll blow-dry your hair. No, I'm fine. Why don't you go in and take a shower first? Mrs. Lu is in such a hurry I didn't mean that What I meant was This way we can all get some rest Help! It's even weirder I see Mrs. Luk Let's do it! One bite at a time Four fours Drink up! Come on, come on. Hello, who's there? Hi, sister-in-law. I'm Fang Yang. I'm a good friend of Gu's. What can I do for you? Brother Yan is drunk at the bar. Can you come over and take a look?

He's a friend of Gu Zhizhi's. He hung up. That's it. I'll blow-dry your hair. But... Isn't Lu Jingyan rumored to be quite crazy? He even plays with flowers What's wrong? Aren't you tired of holding it up like this? It's fine No need to blow. Go to bed. What's coming will come. Get some rest. I'll sleep in the living room So this Lu Jingyan He didn't want to consummate his marriage with me She scared the hell out of me. The Shen family won't tolerate her. Is she really going to fall out with me? And marry those old men? That's impossible. If I say Shen Nanyin is making trouble She just wants you to coax her. If you give her an excuse and she doesn't take it. You'll hang her for a few days and she'll behave herself. That's right. Didn't your father ask you to marry Ms. Su of the Su family? Let's get the word out. In less than three days. She'll come back and beg you on her knees Brother Yan. I don't think Shen Nanyin I don't think she's that kind of person Listen to me.

You have to protect her well Lu Jingyan made up Such an outrageous reason Oh, I see Sister-in-law You're the girl my brother's been secretly in love with for years You're the girl my brother's been secretly in love with for years, right? That's right I've had a crush on Yum Yum for a long time That's why I'm lucky to marry her. I'm lucky to be able to marry her What are you talking about? What will you say if you're asked? Now that you've married the girl of your choice I must cherish her That's only natural. When are you going to do the wedding ah You want to have a wedding? I listen to my wife. Nanyin. When do you want to get married? Mom, I'm only a junior in college. We'll talk about it after graduation. What? Lu Jingyan, you asshole! You're still so young. How could he take you back as his wife? Idiot! Mom, you're scaring my sister-in-law. Xiao Yin! If he tries to bully you. You must come to me. Understand? Yes, ma'am. Mom, I love her more than I can say. Don't scare my wife away. You bastard! You know how to love your wife? I've taught you well. Although I know it's not true. But saying it like that It seems that I'm really the wife I'm the wife he never forgets. Let's go, ma'am. Don't you have to go back to school? Yes, ma'am. This is a passenger seat for girls, right? He really did like a girl before. If he didn't like her. I'll change it. No, he didn't. There's no girl who doesn't like it. I'm going back to class. Uh-huh. Shen Nanyin. You have a family now. I know that. Give me your hand. You're still in school. I'm not asking you to disclose your married status But you can't be private. You can't meet with Mr. Koo in private. Can you do that? Yes, I can. Gu and I I don't think we'll ever see each other again. What if someone at school Wants to add your contact information. What should you do? I'll tell them I have a boyfriend. That's a good one. Go ahead. OK Nanyin. This way. Good morning. Hey! This student Please stop thinking out of the box. Wedding night! Luk King's banquet! You really didn't do anything No, I didn't. You're such a beautiful woman. It's not because Lu Jingyan can't do it, is it? Don't talk nonsense. Nan Yin. Don't worry. I did the math for you yesterday. The cards show Lu Jingyan Is the one you're destined to be with True or false? What's going on here? Gu's girlfriend? Isn't it Shen Nanyin? Didn't you read the news? The Gu and Su families The Gu and Su families have already announced their marriage This is Su Yaqin, the Su family's eldest daughter So Shen Nanyin Was dumped by Gu Yan Nanyin! Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. I'm married. I don't care anymore. Not to mention other things. Lu Jingyan's body and looks He's a dead ringer for Gu Yan. Well done! I'm trying to get you to do something. Be quiet for a while This time, the virtual stock buyer's ranking It's already out Let's congratulate Shen Nanyin. Wow, it's awesome! This week's No. 1 in assets is Shen again. She's awesome! Ms. Shen is so beautiful and powerful. How could anyone want to break up with her? That's right. A virtual thing. What's so beautiful about it? If it were real. I do not know what kind of loss No matter how good your grades are. But it is just an escort If you can't afford to lose, you're just a rumor monger Chen Yuanyi, are you a man? What are you saying? What's wrong with you? Your mouth stinks like garlic You're not afraid of smelling everyone We Nan Yin are good-tempered, we won't argue with you! I'm not Okay, okay, don't argue. It's time for class Come and sit down The scummy guy's friends all need to be cleaned up. They all need to be cleaned up. I heard you're Ziyan's ex-girlfriend. Not really. At most, it's Truth or Dare? No matter what you are I hope that from now on I want you to keep your distance from him. Then you should ask the school Cancel the large classroom Ms. Shen. I think a woman should know what she's doing. We've broken up. You're still wearing the ring Zhiyan gave you. It's not appropriate, is it? This ring isn't from Mr. Gu. It's close enough. It's a ring from the L family. Before you lie. You have to think before you lie. Can you afford it? Believe it or not. This ring is from my boyfriend. It's not Gu's. Shen Nanyin You've been fooling around behind Gu's back. Let's see if he still wants you when he finds out What's wrong with Mom? Yum-Yum. Is class over? Have you eaten yet? I just got out of class. I'm going to eat later. The food in the cafeteria is awful. Home-made food is clean and nutritious. I asked Uncle Zhang to bring you some food. He'll be here soon. Thanks, Mom. You're such a good boy. We're family. Don't say thank you. Go get the food at the door. Yes, ma'am. Oh, by the way. I have a favor to ask you. For the Beijing banquet. Whenever he gets busy, he forgets to eat. I've told him several times, but he doesn't listen. Why don't you help me make sure he eats? Mom, but he doesn't always listen to me After all, we're just a fake marriage Don't you have a class this afternoon? Why are you here? I came to see you for dinner. I'm sorry. Mom said you always forget to eat. That's why I'm here to supervise you. Do you know how to eat? Can you eat? Mom's pretty good at picking people to supervise. Now that we're married Of course, whatever Mrs. Luk says I'll do whatever Mrs. Lu says He's actually He's really willing to listen to me? Gu Zhizhi You're very generous with your ex-girlfriends. L's ring is just a gift. Why don't you just marry her? What ring? The one she's wearing. It's a limited edition from L. I didn't give her a ring. She said so herself. The ring is from her boyfriend. Not from you. Is she in love with a rich man? No way. Hmph! I'm afraid that when she's with you. She's already cuckolded you And still say I'm sorry. Thank you, Mr. ZhiYan. What are you doing? It's just a cup If it's broken, it's broken Go away! This cup is very important to me It's a gift from Shen Nanyin. Gu Zhizhi. What's the use of being in love now? She doesn't want you anymore. Shut up! Get out of here! Ouch! This econometrics really gave me vomit. Whenever I see that teacher I get a black eye. I'm dizzy and I'm sweating. Me too. I'd rather take a full day of Principles of Marxism. Tone. Let's talk. We have nothing to talk about. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Who gave you this ring? Ah! No wonder you're so impatient You want to break up with me. Looks like you've found a good match. Don't touch me! A fraudulent contract It's not legally valid. Our relationship Originally from your deception Now I have the right Automatically terminate this relationship And If I remember correctly We're in a non-established relationship I have the right to find another one, don't I? Our Nanyin is a real scholar She speaks with depth Does he know your family's situation? Can he marry you? What? I'll give you a little favor and you're hooked. I'm not married. Don't you understand? Who else would marry you but me? The Shen family is a bottomless pit. Who doesn't know that? That's not what I meant. Don't touch me. Don't touch me. I find you really strange. You didn't like me in the first place. Why are you here now? You've got a new bet, don't you? That's all in the past. Do you have to hold on to it? I'm married now. Do you still want to hold on to me? She told Su Yaqin The ring was a gift from her boyfriend Now she keeps emphasizing that she's married She's just trying to annoy me. Yum Yum How long are you going to keep this up? It was my fault for making the bet in the first place. But I didn't say I'd break up with you. The end is still the same. We're breaking up all the same. Shen Nanyin Stop right there. I don't have to have you. I don't want to see you again either. Go away. That day in my car. You didn't seem happy. No, I wasn't. I saw something on the passenger side. I got you something. You don't seem to like it. It's for me. On the passenger seat. That pink and tender thing Is actually Lu Jingyan Lu Jingyan prepared it especially for me Me? I don't dislike it I just Just what? I thought it was from you. I thought it belonged to a girl you had a crush on. That's why I'm afraid of breaking it. Shen Nanyin We're already married. There won't be a third person But But we're only contractually married Mrs. Lu Are you trying to play with me? Open marriage? No, not at all No Nanyin Before getting the license Do you still remember what I said to you? Which one? What did you say? If I want Not just a marriage contract What if I want a de facto marriage as well? Mrs. Lu I repeat What I want Not just a contract marriage I want I want a marriage that's worthy of the name I know. I'll do my best. Why don't you stay here and sleep? I mean. You take the bed, I'll take the couch. The couch is too small. You can't sleep comfortably Do you think Ms. Lu If she knew Her precious daughter-in-law sleeps on the sofa How would she react? That's right Then Why don't you and I share the bed? Do you think it's okay? Are you sure? Since you've decided to give it a try. I have to take this step. Uh-huh. Shen Nanyin I will wait until you When you're willing to accept me. This is This is our wedding room. Do you like it? It's okay if you don't. There are many other houses like this And bungalows with a river view. You can choose until you're satisfied. I like it.

Now she's deserved it, right? Shen Nanyin! I'm asking you. You're not really Married to this man, right? Ah! What's wrong with you, Gu Zhizhi? I remember when I told you clearly I was already married. You just didn't believe me. How long has it been since you broke up with me? Do you know him? Do you know what he's like? Gu Zhizhi. In your eyes. I've always been an accessory. You think I'm not good enough for you. You think you You think you deserve better. You're engaged now Why are you still looking for me? And by the way. I've found I've found a better man. A thousand times better than you I think we can be decent now. Let go of me. If you don't make it clear to me today. I won't let go Gu's words My wife's words I've made it very clear. If there's a next time. It'll be more than that. Let's go. Uh-huh. Stop right there. Don't forget, Mr. Gu. Wazhong and the Su family are still working together. Let go! Hey! Hey! Hey! Bastard! Get your ass back here! Yes, you are. You're useless. You don't know how much you weigh? I told you not to get into Lu's business What can you do against Lu Jingyan? Father! It's Lu Jingyan who's being unreasonable He's arrogant to the extreme He's so arrogant! Gu Jingyan will crush you to death It's as easy as crushing an ant. Uncle This is none of Ziyan's business Everyone in Beijing knows the power of the Lu family Why would we mess with them? There must be a misunderstanding There must be some misunderstanding I don't care what the misunderstanding is Find a suitable opportunity for yourself To apologize to Lu Jingyan Or else I'll break your legs This is your good ex-girlfriend She's deliberately taking revenge She's blowing smoke up Lu Jingyan's ass To get him to go against Huazhong That's impossible Lu Jingyan is just paying lip service. In his heart. He just wants to play. Let's see how long you can fool yourself. This is It's a business trip present It's a lot. Not much. Do you like it? It's the first time I've received so many gifts. I'm very happy and touched. Thank you. It's just that I'm afraid of too much goodness. Just like when Gu Zhiwei started out. He was very nice to me. But he just took it back. It would have been better not to have had it at all. What's wrong? I'm just scared. I'm afraid that everything I have now. Will soon become a thing of the past. Shen Nanyin. I'm different from others. Since I've decided on you. You never have to worry about these things Will disappear one day. Uh-huh. Ah! You're tired from your trip, Mrs. Luk Go and take a rest first ah Hiss Ah I can sleep with you? What? Then outside There are still many rooms, right? Do you think I'm disturbing you? No, I'm not.

Yes, ma'am I'll do whatever Mrs. Luk says Nanyin Why is your face so red? It's too hot, isn't it? Then we're not going. Hey! Has it been a long time since we got together? We're all here today.

It seems marrying Mr. Lu Was the right choice Look at her moisturized face I know Mr. Lu treats her well Mr. Lu treats me very well He's different from what I imagined He's completely different And he's mature, stable and kind.

That's all I have to say I don't want you to come back to me Good job, Nanyin.

Did you sleep together? No, I haven't Just kissing I don't think so Mr. Lu looks like he's doing well. You guys are moving too slowly, aren't you? Tell me the truth Is it because he's not good enough? Or you don't want to? In fact. I've long been in love with Lu Jingyan But I don't know what's wrong with him. He just ignores me I don't know what to do. Maybe he has a crush on someone else. You! You're already married. If you like it, go for it. Who cares if Mr. Lu has a crush? If you're not together, you're not meant to be Now you're with Mr. Lu You're the one who's close to him Do you understand? So you're telling me to go after him? As the saying goes, there's a veil between a woman and a man Mr. Lu is such a good man Don't miss out on him That makes sense But how can I go after him? He's been changing girlfriends He had a new girlfriend every week It's hard to chase this kind of prodigal son, isn't it? Yes, it is. I've never chased this type either. Why don't you ask the netizens? Let's see. The top girl in the financial district has a crush on someone. I'm heartbroken First Sister, you should talk to a few more guys.

Who else could it be? Didn't Luk say so? It's you. How can that be? We went to the same school. But he's one year older than me We didn't know each other at all Anyway, after all these years I've only seen you as a woman You're the only woman I've seen around him What are you talking about? You're so happy. He played a joke on me. Yes, a joke. I like jokes. Listen to him. I'll tell you when I get back. I haven't even started eating yet. I'm already full of this dog food. You're so mean.

Huazhong is being suppressed lately. Today's shareholders' meeting The shareholders are all over the place. They're demanding an explanation from Mr. Yan. It's hard to get out of this. I've asked you to speak to Mr. Qiao today. Have you seen him? Yes. Yes, I've seen him I've found out why. Then tell me. Why are you so evasive? Lu Jingyan is targeting us because Because of Shen Nanyin What's that? Lu Jingyan He's targeting us because of his lover. He's crazy! Brother Yan. Shen Nanyin is not Lu Jingyan's lover. She's his wife They're married Shen Nanyin is not his lover She's his wife They're married Don't fucking joke with me! How could Lu Jingyan Marry Shen Nanyin? Mr. Yin At first, I didn't believe it either But today Lu Jingyan admitted in front of everyone He admitted it himself They are indeed married I don't believe it Shen Nanyin loves me How could she marry someone else? And Lu Jingyan He's so high and mighty How could he really marry her? If it's true Then why is the Shen family on the verge of bankruptcy? Call her now. Tell her I want to see her. I want to ask her face to face. Mr. Yin. I've advised you before. If you really like her. Apologize to her Get her back. You think she's not good enough for you? Besides. She's married now. Why don't we just forget about it? I'll let you fight Go ahead. Go ahead. Okay, okay. Shen Nanyin has blackmailed me. Go find out for me. Which room is Shen Nanyin in? Why are you here? Yum Yum What's going on with you and Lu Jingyan? Are you really married? No, I'm not, right? You deliberately lied to Chen Yuanyi and the others, right? Gu Zhizhi. I've told you many times I'm already married. It's come to this. Do you still want to deceive yourself and others? No, I don't. It's not possible. It's me you like. You're still mad at me. Is that right? Yum Yum, I really know I'm wrong I was too self-righteous. I was too ignorant. I shouldn't have gambled and cheated on you But you Why are you so quick? You're marrying someone else? Gu Zhizhi, that's enough! It's true that I used to like you. I thought you were my salvation. I thought You were different from the other boys. But what did you do? You gave me up, didn't you? Didn't you? Now you say you like me. Don't you think you're funny? Hey, Yum Yum You're married I don't mind either You can still get divorced if you're married Give me one more chance One last time.

You can't even call me &quot;Mrs. Mr. Lu What kind of woman would you have? Can't you give Nanyin back to me? Have you ever thought about it? Shen Nanyin doesn't have any kind of man You're so successful now. You were born with a golden spoon in your mouth. With the family's wealth. Piled up by the family's wealth. Shen Nanyin's ability and character Even without me There will be more people to pursue her Why would she come back to you? You're the one who doesn't deserve Nanyin Get lost. Don't let me see you again You're pestering my wife. Heung-tse. It'll take more than a kick. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I won't give up just like that Lu Jingyan. I don't know Why did he come to me? It's not your fault His behavior What do you mean you're sorry? You don't have to deal with this on your own. You don't have to deal with it yourself. Just close the door Let your husband go Lu Jingyan, why are you so nice? I've told you before You're my wife It's only right that I treat you well. Just because you're my wife? Or do you like me a little bit? Anyway. After all these years. I've only seen you as a woman. By his side Lu Jingyan Thank you, Mr. Lu How can I thank you?

It's better than being embarrassed. You've been thinking about it all this time. Why don't you just do it? Tell him plainly Why don't you tell him? That seems reasonable Should I tell Lu Jingyan directly I like you What should I do? What about you? Can you give me your Second button? Can you give me your second button? That's it. On this shirt of yours. The second button on your shirt. Can I have it? It's the second button on your shirt. What does this mean? I mean. I like you. I like me. Am I hearing things?

Come on out for breakfast. Do you want me to carry you? No, I don't think so. Tone. You were drunk last night. There's something I'm afraid you won't remember I'd like to repeat it. What was it? Yum Yum. I said I like you I know I won't forget. I should have known he liked me too. Why did I bother before? Even if he had a crush before. That's in the past. I'll just have his future. Oh, wow. What's going on? Mr. Lu made an official announcement. What is it? Come on, let me see. Look! Ling Yue's official blog It was posted this morning Mr. Lu's work inspection photo. Look. There's a cut on his lip. Someone must have bitten him. That one. Maybe. It's him. Accidentally Maybe he bumped it or touched it. You're being naive. A bump? How to cause such a wound ah Not to mention Someone commented below Asking if Mrs. Luk had bitten it The official blog even liked it Isn't that tacit acceptance? Hey Tell me What kind of person Who is worthy of our Mr. Lu? We'll find out later Once my relationship with Lu Jingyan stabilizes a bit more We may be able to announce it to the public Come in. Mr. Gu There's a man named Shen Dingguo He wants to see you. What's he doing here? Tell him to come in. Yes, sir. Aigoo! Ziyan. Please! Save the Shen family! Hmph! Please! Your Shen Nanyin Isn't she married to Lu Jingyan? She has such a good son-in-law. Why are you begging me? What's the point of marrying? This is Lu Jingyan. He just traded a piece of land In exchange for our Nan Yin She's just a secret lover Otherwise Why wouldn't she persuade Lu Jingyan to come and help? Aigoo! I can't help it That's why That's why I came here to beg you. What did you say? You sold Nan Yin to him They're not married Of course not. You need a household registration to get married, right? We're the Shen family. I've always kept the account book Locked in the safe. Hey, besides. We have to announce the marriage to the public, right? Isn't it? I think Mr. Lu He just likes our Nanyin's It's just her face It's just for fun Good for you, Mr. Lu! It seems you don't You don't really love her, do you? You almost fooled me It's a pity Shen Nanyin She's been taken for a ride But today I read Ling Yue official microblogging hinted Lu Jingyan has a wife Can not be Is he deliberately He's deliberately trying to create a wife-loving persona That must be it. That's why Ling Yue's stock market That's why Ling Yue's stock market is in the red You Lu Jingyan You almost fooled me Looks like you're in on the game, too. Zhi Yan ah If you want our Nanyin To come back to you I do have an idea Let's hear it I hired someone to take photos I've hired someone to take photos of them I just have to get them out there. So that everyone will know That he's building up a reputation as a loving wife While keeping a mistress. Hmph Then his image Will definitely go down the drain Ling Yue's stock price Will definitely be affected Huazhong Naturally, we can take a breather. You're still her real father, aren't you? This way The news that she's being kept Will be exposed. She'll be under a lot of pressure. Aiya! Zhi Yan ah Nanyin is not thinking straight That's why she was tricked by him We're trying to help her. Only public opinion To let her know How wrong she is In this way. We can suppress Ling Yue And bring Nanyin back to you It's a win-win situation. That's good. Let's do it. Uncle Shen. Don't worry about it. When it's done. I'll invest in your Shen's business. Good! Mr. Lu. The PR department just sent an urgent notice. Someone posted on the Internet. Maliciously slandering Mrs. Lu Isn't this the flower of the finance department in our school? That's the flower of the department? She broke up with Mr. Gu And now she's on the list of big spenders. Zoom in and look at the license plate. It's a serial number, 543 meters from the north of Beijing. Who else is Mr. Lu? But didn't he just announce Married? Mr. Lu has a marketing campaign again. He said his wife Said They say she's a sucker. Cold-blooded and heartless After being adopted by you. She broke off all contact with the Shen family. That's a load of crap. A lot of netizens have followed suit. What if Mrs. Shen finds out? What should we do? First, ask the PR department. Contact them to delete the post. Find out who's behind it. Don't look at all the bad reviews on the internet. What are you looking at? Didn't you look at your cell phone today? I didn't look at my cell phone. I had that thing this afternoon. And my stomach hurt. So I came back. What's wrong? She's not feeling well. Is it menstrual cramps? I'll rub it for you. I don't think that's a good idea. It's what I'm supposed to do. Today on the school forum. Suddenly there was a black thread. The netizens were not very nice. Your phone doesn't work again. I thought So you thought I'm crying because of those black posts. I cried. I'm not that fragile. You're overthinking it Mr. Lu found out. It was Gu Yan and Shen Dingguo It was Gu Yan and Shen Dingguo. I know. Yum Yum There's something I'd like to talk to you about. I'd like to discuss it with you. Tell me. How about we make our wedding public? Do you want to break the rumors To break the rumors? If you don't want to go public Make it public. Actually, I've been thinking about it for a long time. We'll wait until the right time We'll go public when the time is right. I think now is the right time It's the right time. Since Shen Dingguo and Gu Yan They won't give up. I'll make them feel good about themselves. Shen Dingguo. What have you done? I only gave you permission To publish those photos. I didn't give you permission to do anything else, did I? All I wanted was Lu Jingyan. He'll lose his reputation Now the target of attack Why are they all targeting Nanyin? Aiya! Zhi Yan, Zhi Yan. Since we've already done this. Why do we still have to decide who to attack first? The result is the same anyway Let's not dwell on the details You. Just wait for my daughter Lu Jingyan abandons her She'll come back to me Isn't that what you want? To come back? You still have to thank me. I'm sorry, Mr. Gu. What's wrong? Mr. Gu. Ling Yue Group has issued a statement. A statement has been issued. Read it yourself Didn't you say she and Lu Jingyan Are not married? She's just a lover?

Hello, Ms. Shen. I'd like to formally introduce myself. My name is Xu Yun. I'm a good friend of Yan's. We're very good friends. Ah Yan. Why are you calling me that? Oh! And then? Ms. Shen. I'm in poor health. I've been convalescing abroad. I've just returned. Thank you for staying with Yan these days. I'm sure you're here to declare your sovereignty. That's why Lu Jingyan He didn't stay with Xu Yun. It's because she's sick. But she was forced into marriage by Mrs. Lu. So she found me as her double. To relieve her boredom. Now that I've recovered. I can continue to accompany Yan I think You can retire now, can't you? Is this your wishful thinking? Or is it Yan's wish? Ms. Shen. There's something I need to say. There's no need to be so explicit. What I want. Naturally, it's also Yan's wish. After all, you've been by his side You've been by his side for such a long time You've done a lot of hard work for him Ah Yan doesn't want to break your heart So I'll be the bad guy. Ms. Shen What doesn't belong to you Don't even think about it. Xu Yun. That's what I'm saying. You should tell yourself. Nyan Nyan. What are you doing here? Hee-hyun.

It happened in high school. But why didn't he tell me? Then why didn't he ever tell me? Uh-huh. That's the thing. I think it's strange too.
