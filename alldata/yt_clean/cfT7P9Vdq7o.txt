A CENTURY LATER, AFTER LOSING VIENNA'S JUST MORE LAID-BACK. TODAY, ENJOYING THE FACT THAT VIENNA IS SIMPLY AN EXPERT AND THAT INCLUDES PERHAPS THE SACHER TORTE. DEMEL'S CAFE AND BAKERY IS MUCH-LOVED THIS PLACE WAS THE EMPEROR'S CUSTOMERS ENJOY A CLOSE-UP THE FAMOUS SACHER TORTE IS MADE TO ORDER APART FROM ITS APRICOT FILLING, THE RECIPE SEEMS CHOCOLATE ON CHOCOLATE. VIENNA'S TASTY CUISINE, IS MULTINATIONAL.

AND AS IF PROVIDING A FINE VENUE TO WALK OFF THE CITY'S A BIG PART OF VIENNA FILLED WITH OF AUSTRIA'S GLORY DAYS THE ENTICING SHOPPING STREETS HAVE BEEN TRAFFIC-FREE WITH ITS ELEGANT STOREFRONTS JUST TAKING A STROLL <i> HALT!</i> HISTORY IS EVERYWHERE. EVEN IN THE STREET MUSICIANS. THIS WELL-DECORATED MUSICAL WHEN AUSTRIA'S HAD A MORE SERIOUS JOB TO DO. ONE OF THE CHARMS OF VIENNA IS HOW THINGS FOR GENERATIONS, A QUICK LUNCH BUFFET TRZESNIEWSKI FAMOUS FOR ITS CHEAP SIMPLY POINT THREE DIFFERENT SANDWICHES I'M HAVING HAM AND EGGS, AND CHICKEN LIVER. <i> EIN PFIFF, BITTE.</i> THE TRADITIONAL DRINK HERE FAST FOOD -- VIENNA-STYLE. THE MASSIVE IS THE GOTHIC NEEDLE WHILE HEAVILY DAMAGED THE CHURCH SURVIVED. TODAY, IT SYMBOLIZES THE CITY'S IN THE LAST DAYS OF THE WAR, THE ORIGINAL WENT UP IN FLAMES. SHORTLY AFTER THE WAR, WITH A FINANCIAL THE ROOF WAS REBUILT IN ITS ORIGINAL, THE CERAMIC TILES LOCALS WHO CONTRIBUTED, EACH SYMBOLICALLY &quot;OWN&quot; ONE FOR THEIR DONATION. THE ORNATE NAVE IS GOTHIC WHILE THE COLUMNS THEY ALSO TELL A STORY. RICHLY POPULATED WITH STATUES, THEY MAKE A SAINTLY PARADE THAT LEADS IN THIS STATUE OF MARY -- CALLED, &quot;THE MADONNA PEOPLE OF ALL WALKS REFUGE IN THE HOLY MOTHER. NEARBY, SAINT SEBASTIAN -- WHO NEVER GOES ANYWHERE REMINDS THE FAITHFUL THE CENTERPIECE DEDICATED TO SAINT STEPHEN DEPICTING THE STONING OF THE EARLY CHRISTIAN WORLD WAR II DAMAGE PORTABLE TREASURES, LIKE THIS 15th CENTURY WERE HIDDEN AWAY IN LOCAL BEFORE THE WAR, WITH WINDOWS LIKE THESE. BUT MOST OF THE CHURCH'S THE TUPPERWARE-COLORED DATE FROM 1950. THE GOTHIC PULPIT, CARVED FROM ITS BUSY SYMBOLISM WHICH WAS READ FROM ITS LECTERN. READINGS WERE LITERALLY SUPPORTED BY THE FOUR BELOW IT ALL IS A SELF-PORTRAIT OF A SELF-ASSURED ARTIST MOST GOTHIC ART FOR THE GLORY OF GOD, BUT MUCH OF THE ART HERE AROUND THE YEAR 1500 WHEN THE RENAISSANCE SPIRIT, WAS CREEPING NORTH. WITH THE HUMANISM MAN WAS ALLOWED TO SHINE -- AND ARTISTS -- A MASTER BUILDER WERE RECOGNIZED VIENNA'S OLD CENTER BY ITS GRAND IN THE 1860s, HAD THE CITY'S HE REPLACED IT WHICH ARCS NEARLY THREE MILES ONE OF EUROPE'S GREAT STREETS, THE RINGSTRASSE IS LINED WITH MANY FOR A HANDY DO-IT-YOURSELF HOP ON TRAM NUMBER ONE IN MY GUIDEBOOKS, I LIKE TO DESCRIBE THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HANDY PUBLIC BECAUSE THIS RING ROAD IS ACTUALLY OLDER THAN WHAT YOU SEE IS VERY &quot;NEO&quot; -- NEO-RENAISSANCE, NEO-GOTHIC, THE CHOICE OF STYLE SEEMS TO FIT THE AUSTRIAN PARLIAMENT BECAUSE DEMOCRACY THE CITY HALL RECALLING THE AGE RAN THE GOVERNMENT. MUSEUMS ARE NEO-RENAISSANCE -- AND VIENNA'S COURT THEATER THE AGE WHEN OPERA FROM THE RINGSTRASSE, TAKES US FARTHER AFIELD. LIKE TO THE BEACH, IN THE 1970s, VIENNA DUG A CANAL PARALLEL TO CREATING BOTH A FLOOD BARRIER AND A MUCH-LOVED ISLAND ESCAPE. THIS SKINNY, 12 MILE LONG ISLAND PROVIDES A NATURAL WONDERLAND. ALL ALONG THIS TRAFFIC-FREE, YOU'LL FIND FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD THEIR OWN CABIN IT'S AN IDEAL PLACE FOR A GOOD AND THE APPEAL OF THE ICE CREAM [ BELL RINGS ] FOR CENTURIES, VIENNA WAS RULED THEY HAD THE SCHONBRUNN PALACE, WITH ITS EXPANSIVE GROUNDS WAS THEIR SUMMER RESIDENCE. THEIR MAIN PALACE, THE HOFBURG, THIS IMPOSING AND SPRAWLING COMPLEX GREW WITH THE FAMILY EMPIRE UNTIL JUST BEFORE WORLD WAR I, WHEN THIS LAST WHILE THE LAST HABSBURG THE PALACE IS STILL PLENTY BUSY. IT HAS THE OFFICES AND IT'S HOME TO HUNDREDS THE SPANISH RIDING SCHOOL, AND THE PALACE ITSELF THE LAVISH IMPERIAL APARTMENTS TO GIVE THEIR ROYAL RESIDENTS GRANDEUR FIT FOR A GOD. AFTER ALL, IN THE AGE OF DIVINE MONARCHS, KINGS AND EMPERORS LIKE THE HABSBURGS CLAIMED GOD HIMSELF TO RULE THE HABSBURG'S WERE ONE WHO RULED NEARLY THE WALLS BETWEEN THE ROOMS ARE WIDE ENOUGH TO HIDE THE BIG, ORNATE STOVES, HEATED THE ROOMS. THE DECOR IS SPLENDID BAROQUE -- THE PREFERRED AS IT SERVED AS A KIND TO SELL THE OLD REGIME NOTION THAT SOME WERE BORN TO RULE AND OTHERS WERE BORN WHEN THE EMPEROR SAT DOWN TO DINNER, THIS IS THE MORE WITH JUST YOUR BASIC SILVERWARE. FOR MORE FORMAL STATE DINNERS THEY BROUGHT OUT EACH DRINK CAME AND SPITTOONS SIX CENTURIES OF HABSBURGS INCLUDING MARIA THERESA SHE WAS FAMOUS AND CLEVERLY MARRYING INTO EUROPE'S IN ORDER TO EXPAND HER EMPIRE. TODAY'S PALACE IS FURNISHED FROM THE AGE OF MARIA'S EMPEROR FRANZ JOSEPH. HE RULED FOR 68 YEARS AND WAS THE EMBODIMENT IN ITS FINAL DECADES. FRANZ JOSEPH THAT INSTILLED IN HIM THIS WAS FRANZ JOSEPH IN 1915, WHEN HE WAS 85 YEARS OLD. WEARING HIS UNIFORM HE NEVER UNDERSTOOD HIS MONARCHY WAS BECOMING, AND HE DIDN'T THINK THAT SO FEW OF HIS SUBJECTS STILL, TO MEET WITH THE EMPEROR HERE FAMOUSLY ENERGETIC FRANZ JOSEPH STOOD TO MEET WITH THE COMMONERS. THEY'D COME TO ASK HIM A FAVOR OR TELL HIM &quot;THANKS&quot; STANDING KEPT THINGS MOVING. ON THE TABLE, YOU CAN READ A PARTIAL LIST HE HAD ON JANUARY 3, 1910. THE EMPEROR PRESIDED IN THIS ROOM. HE RULED THE AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN SO, HUNGARIANS THE PAINTINGS ON THE WALL SHOW THE MILITARY DEFEAT OF A POPULAR NOT TOO SUBTLE. FRANZ JOSEPH NURTURED AN IMAGE OF BEING SPARTAN THIS IS HIS FAMOUS AND PORTABLE WASHSTAND. WHILE HE HAD A TYPICAL EMPEROR'S HIS DRESSER WITH PORTRAITS OF HIS WIFE, THE EMPRESS ELISABETH... ELISABETH -- FRANZ JOSEPH'S MYSTERIOUS, AND BEAUTIFUL WIFE, IN THE PALACE, YOU'LL LEARN HER ESCAPES, DIETING MANIA, SISSI'S HARD-EARNED TINY WAIST WAS 21 INCHES AROUND AFTER GIVING BIRTH HER MAIN GOALS IN LIFE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PRESERVING MAINTAINING AND TENDING HERE IN HER BEDROOM, SERVANTS WORKED TWO HOURS A DAY SHE'D EXERCISE ON THIS. HER BATHROOM WAS EQUIPPED THE FINEST ANYWHERE -- WHICH RESTED ON THE FIRST INSTALLED IN 1888. IN SPITE OF SEVERE DIETING AGE TOOK ITS TOLL. AFTER TURNING 30, AND WAS SEEN IN PUBLIC IN 1898, WHILE VISITING GENEVA, EMPRESS ELISABETH BY AN ITALIAN ANARCHIST. SISSI HAS OFTEN BEEN COMPARED BECAUSE OF HER BEAUTY, HER BITTERSWEET LIFE, WHEN YOU VISIT VIENNA, IT'S EASY TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THE GROWING LEGEND THE HABSBURGS RULED WHILE HISTORIANS WAS NEITHER HOLY NOR ROMAN, THEY<i> DID</i> HAVE THE IMPERIAL TREASURY SHOWS OFF THE BEST JEWELS VISITORS REFLECT FILLED WITH THE PRECIOUS DESIGNED TO HELP KEEP ONE ROYAL FAMILY THIS 500-YEAR-OLD UNICORN HORN, OR PERHAPS WAS CONSIDERED VERY POWERFUL POSSESSED BY A DIVINE MONARCH -- IT GAVE ITS OWNER SOMETHING RULERS THE COLLECTION'S HIGHLIGHT OF THE HOLY ROMAN EMPEROR. THE SYMBOLISM WAS BOTH HOLY AND ROMAN. THE JEWELED ARCH OF ANCIENT ROMAN EMPERORS THE HABSBURGS CLAIMED TO BE. THE CROSS SAYS THE EMPEROR RULED AS CHRIST'S KING SOLOMON'S PORTRAIT THAT KINGS CAN BE WISE AND GOOD. KING DAVID IS SIMILAR PROOF THE CROWN'S EIGHT SIDES REPRESENT THE CELESTIAL CITY THE PRECIOUS STONES SYMBOLIZE THE 12 APOSTLES. THE 11th CENTURY IMPERIAL CROSS PRECEDED THE EMPEROR ENCRUSTED WITH JEWELS, IT CARRIED WHAT WAS BELIEVED TO BE A SUBSTANTIAL CHUNK THROUGH THE CENTURIES, ACTUALLY CARRIED THIS YOU CAN SEE BITS OF THE SO-CALLED BUT THIS IS A PRIME PIECE -- WITH AN ACTUAL NAIL HOLE. ADJACENT TO THE PALACE, BELOW A CHURCH WHILE THE HABSBURGS SINCE THE END OF WORLD WAR I, THEY MAINTAIN A HOLD AS YOU FEEL BUT VISITING IS NOT AS EASY THESE EARLY ORGAN DONORS -- ABOUT 150 HABSBURGS IN ALL -- LEFT THEIR HEARTS THEIR ENTRAILS AND THE REST IN THE<i> KAISERGRUFT</i> THE ORNATE DOUBLE COFFIN AND HER HUSBAND, FRANZ I, IS FESTOONED AND SURROUNDED BY THE TOMBS THE ROYAL TOMBS OF ART AND SYMBOLS HOW THEY WANTED TO BE REMEMBERED IS REFLECTED IN THE TOMBS FRANZ JOSEPH'S IS AN APPROPRIATELY HIS WIFE, EMPRESS ELISABETH ALWAYS SEEMS TO GET WHILE IT'S FUN TO CHASE DOWN REMEMBER THAT THE REAL LEGACY IS THE MAGNIFICENCE STEP OUTSIDE. APPRECIATE THE ORNATE SKYLINE OF VIENNA. THE HOFBURG PALACE OFFERS THE HOT AND MUGGY BUTTERFLY ZONE IS A TROPICAL WONDERLAND IN THIS COMMUNITY THE TRAYS SERVING UP ARE THE TAVERN. THIS GANG'S LICKING AS IT BEADS, AND THEN JUST HANGS OUT THERE IN A STUPOR... OR FLIES IN ANYTHING BUT A STRAIGHT LINE. VIENNA'S NASCH MARKET IS NEARBY. ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS AGO, THE CITY DECIDED TO COVER UP THE LONG, NARROW SQUARE WAS FILLED WITH THAT STILL BUSTLES ALMOST DAILY.
