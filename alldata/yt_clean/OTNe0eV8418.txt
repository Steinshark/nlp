LeetCode is the bane of many as these are the questions asked in The truth is, you don't need to to ace your interviews. All you and you can solve any problem. Using this engineers I know have landed jobs at FAANG Every LeetCode or interview question can be broken down into simple steps - no Today, we're going to go through those steps so even if it seems impossible. I'll to follow, how to figure out what data solve a popular hard LeetCode question as The first step is to simplify the problem. Most LeetCode questions have lots of fluff The truth is, all LeetCode questions are and you need to change them After reading any question, you should be or out loud if it's to an interviewer, in the "we do this to the inputs", and If you're struggling to understand manually walk through a test case - this often Also, if it's a real interview, ask lots marks for asking clarifying questions, make sure you catch the edge cases - a unique or unclear way of handling, and --- Let's put this step into action for - **Simplify:** The inputs are two strings, letter at a time in the `beginWord` to until we reach our `endWord`. representing how many words it took to get was impossible, in which case our output is 0. starting word as hit, and our ending word as word to get another word in the word list. Hit becomes dot. As we keep doing this, you can changing one letter at a time, and finally, we - **Questions**: Now, here are might ask an interviewer to get more insight. - Are the words case sensitive? edge cases we should get clarification on. is the length 1, or do we return 0? Now that we know how what we're solving, LeetCode is just pattern recognition. using the same data structures do is figure out which one you Now, before you do this, you need to be and data structures &amp; algorithms. I which I would check out **Step 1.** If you're a beginner, start out by By this, I mean literally walk through the most don't need to code it, but identify what the time you'll often see places that can be simplified, **Step 2.** Now, let's find the optimal solution. We need to identify the data structure and check to see if the problem provides constraints - For example, if a problem has there is one specific algorithm that If there's no obvious hints in the problem, to identify the pattern. Luckily, the sponsor of flowchart you can use to identify what pattern problems to learn what to look for, and as you committed to memory. AlgoMonster also offers pattern, which you can get for $7/month right now, or two of work as a full-time software engineer! link in my description, and use code BAGEL for an Let's apply this to our LeetCode problem, and then finding the optimal solution. - **Brute Force Approach**: all possible single-letter transformations, and until we reach `endWord`. type this approach out because it's clearly for starters, we know that each word can be of the alphabet except itself. This means we also know we have to do this for each word N. Therefore, our time and space complexities - **Identify the Pattern**: and start by finding the right algorithm to use. is it a graph problem? Well, if a problem or has some element of pathfinding, it is - Now, is it a tree? According to this or leaves it's a tree - otherwise, it's - Now, is the problem related to directed a directed graph has a clear sense of direction any direction between them? No, they don't. versa. Therefore, we can say NO to this as well. one is pretty clear with our question - get from `beginWord` to `endWord`. So, YES. the flowchart, if the edges between words In our case, every transformation of so it is unweighted. Now we can clearly At this point, you've identified the is done. All you need to do now is put this is where practicing the various patterns that 90% of the question is just the same This is best illustrated with We know now that we are using BFS familiar with BFS, I've put the default For our use case, we only need to make our starting node is just our starting word. we also need to keep track of how many As we go through each word in our queue, we we need to go through each letter in our current Now, this will mean we are but we can actually rule out We only care about a transformed 1. If it is a different word than we 2. If it exists in our word list If all of these are true, then we need to check - add 1 to our current number of transformations end word, it must be a different word in our our queue to go through next, and increase our visited set so we don't try it again if another Now it's time to code! at this point, you translate your implementation plan If you forget some syntax, don't interviewers are usually good about letting some help. It's getting the approach For our problem, I've actually mostly implementation - which is great! Now we can run --- Optimally, after you're done, your don't fret! Let's take some time to debug next. "My code ran perfectly and every test There are two types of errors that can If your code doesn't even which is easily fixable, just read If your code runs, but tests error, which requires a bit more digging. - Firstly, how many tests are they're likely edge cases you forgot about - - If multiple tests are failing, then you've - To fix this, the first thing to do is code. run through your code line by line, and walk Most of the time, you'll catch the mistake here. figure out where something is going wrong. different parts of your code and seeing what can show you what exactly is wrong, out why it's not what you're expecting of solving any coding question - finding the but inevitably, little errors always pop start to become familiar with That's it! Press submit if you're on interviewer, and you're done! If you combined with getting familiar with you will be able to solve any LeetCode Thanks so much for watching this video!
