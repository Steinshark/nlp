&gt;&gt; From the Library of &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Our I'm going to ask him to come up now. J.D. [ Applause ] &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So thank Let me give people who may little introduction. JD is Native of Middletown, Ohio. Okay. And a graduate of He then went into the marines [ Applause ] And came back, went to Ohio State, Then went to Yale Law School, of the Yale Law Journal, clerked He is now in the investment world D.C. He is married to a former who is here, somewhere, with bringing his 2 month old son. So if you see a 2 month old So let's start. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Surely, when in your wildest imagination you going to write a New on your first book, or did you? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: No, I certainly &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So was it, where did the idea for &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, it And really, the genesis was that of the concepts and the ideas and most specifically this question about vulnerability And at Yale, we had to write this, of our 3rd year in order to to write it about, sort of, the of social mobility in the United And the more that I started to talk that were advising me, the more, a woman named Amy Chua, is a pretty successful &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:She's &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: She's the author of And she encouraged to bring my personal experiences that I could write something intellectually interesting, but also And as I continued I was obviously a little I didn't like the idea of and telling all these But the more that I wrote, the more that I had a unique contribution. It was that I understood as opposed to just as an academic. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:All right. So you had the idea How long did it take &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, I was so I always had another job And I think that it probably So I started writing it, yeah, and I finished towards &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So or did you do it on a computer? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: No, I My handwriting is absolutely &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:All right. And so, as you're writing it, did or did you just say, I'll write &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah. So this is interesting. And, in some ways, it exemplifies about in the book, this and how social connections can have So because of Amy, when I started into a book project, you know, she to these people that I know And so, one of the people she who eventually became my agent, and and as I quickly learned, when you like Tina really advocating finding a publisher And that's sort of what happened for me was getting into and then once I was there it &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Sometimes first time authors say, you to write a book, and then about how can I get out of this project? So were you in that category? Did you ever want to abandon it? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, I and if my wife is here, she can probably tell you how through the writing process. Yeah, I mean, for me, what was about half way through obviously it was too I couldn't just stop writing it. But, you know, writing 50,000 words just seemed And I realized then what I didn't that I probably had about a 10 to that made it into the And so I just didn't realize what about halfway through it. And yeah, I definitely would it be possible &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So, your The initial print run was 10,000. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Right. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So but 10,000 is good At what point, when the book there aren't enough and we have to go print more? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah. So this happened relatively I want to say, in two There was an interview I did with a that went viral, as they say online. A lot of people were sharing it on and I went to go check my those of you who have that your Amazon ranking in real time how your So there was a point in my like obsessively, probably And I go to check my Amazon like book is out of stock, And I realized then that, oh, wow, we don't have enough And so that's when they on the proverbial presses. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So have been printed, would you say? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: So, I don't know I know that hard copies, we've and it's a little over a million and audio copies and all that stuff. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah. [ Applause ] &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Now, the up with a title right away, and or where did it come from? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: It came with my agent, this woman, Tina. You know, I wanted the word And the reason I wanted that because I thought it captured kind of cultural sub-segment But I also thought that this sort of interesting insider in my family, where my grandma would we're allowed to call but if anybody else then you have to punch And so it was this sort that it always had a really and so I wanted that Bet elegy was really to take awhile before I was one, comfortable with making and I think that was Tina's idea to and there were a couple &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So now that you are reasonable well known, without people asking for or that hasn't come &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: It depends So I get noticed, you know, so back in Columbus I get I get noticed sometimes in D.C. I in Eastern Kentucky or But, you know, like I was in week and 1/2 ago, and I So it definitely appears. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:You have to make a record there, &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, that's right. I think so. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So, of your family? Many of the family secrets that about themselves, everybody You seem to reveal What was the reaction &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, I didn't I have to keep material [ Laughter ] You know, it's interesting. I, in talking to my family about I think that I've noticed from when I started to write the I think the people about spilling the family that no one expected I think now, now that we're at and people are talking there's maybe a little But yeah, you know, some it's in the family, we shouldn't Some people, I think, appreciate and worthwhile story to tell. Some people come down a &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So how come I don't get They don't say that to you yet? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, I but maybe I will now, especially &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. So let's talk about the book itself. I have read it, and I I would say, I think it's and I'd like to go through One is, I think, the writing very to the point, not a Second, your personal story is of thing that, it's It's hard to believe it was true. And then third, the impact, the on in the country, the opioid in certain parts of the country. So let's go through &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:All right. First, the writing style. Were you a gifted writer Where did you get this, what very clear, writing style? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, law school helped a Because one of the things they is don't write with a lot of and concise, direct, And so, you know, thinking about how of the excess words, But, you know, it's if I was a talented writer always. I mean, I don't necessarily think But it's funny, because there that I had to write. And when my family, my family And it's interesting, because it's in Hillbilly Elegy, and they'll pass he was such a great writer, And then when my wife picks up that your family is not being honest of a writer when you So, I don't know. I do think that law school helped. I mean, there's this story where the first big writing I handed it in, I was and this law school professor handed and said, this is a vomit of sentences masquerading So I think if you asked him he'd probably say no. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Now having had a first book normally publishers will you are Ernest Hemingway, let's have another book right away, and the sooner you So surely they are after Are you thinking of &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, so definitely And I think I eventually will. You know, my view on this that I'm trying to So if I write another book, it'll as opposed to immediately. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:But edition of this. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: That's right. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And will you or will you just go &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I think I'll I would like to add a chapter of the political salients that a lot of people have contributed Because, of course, when I I had no idea that it would be in this really, you know, So I think I would like to write because I haven't talked But otherwise, the rest of &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. Before the book, paperback or maybe after the there is supposed to be a movie. Ron Howard is, I guess, or maybe directing it as well. Who is going to play you? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I don't know. The thing about this I wanted to be somebody who's good that people are disappointed [ Laughter ] &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: But yeah, that I have a real trouble meeting, into that, you know, not too &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:I'm Let's go to the second part of why and that is your life story. For those who may not have to give away everything in Where were you born? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I was born in &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Right. And your biological mother and biological father &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: They were. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay, and did they get divorced &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Very shortly after. I think I was maybe a year but before memories, certainly. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So your for the early years? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Correct. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And then with your maternal grandfather &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And what was &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I called and their names were Bonnie and Jim. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. And is that a hillbilly type word, or are they just unique &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: No, I think that in the broader culture. It's not exclusive, I've sort of hillbilly culture. But it's definitely something of the country, disproportionately and Papaw. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Now on the East Coast would say, That's the center of &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:But you and your family's roots, Describe how you came to Ohio, &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, of this really massive migration East Tennessee, West Virginia to And, I think, when they of their cultural attributes even though my family lived in we traveled back to Because I spent so much I spent a lot of my formative years that that was sort And it's interesting, that's a Folks, there are country There are a lot of stories similar up in the industrial Midwest, who or Ohio, felt like their real because they spent so much of and that's where their &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. So you're growing up and you have &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sister, yeah. So, yeah. Different dad, same mom. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. And so both of you are being &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yep. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, so became a nurse sometime after, you so for a couple of And, actually, as I those were pretty good times we weren't struggling economically Before then, you know, I don't know. I think that, you know, my grandparents helped And then, certainly, one of the you know, after mom was no longer thinks were pretty tough And I think, more importantly, There were a lot of issues. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So your was married, or had male who were living with her like So wasn't that kind of disconcerting in the house all the time, or? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, it was from the perspective of people who And I think that, you until I was older what I didn't like it when I was a kid. I certainly didn't like that, or I'd feel like this guy of a father figure, and then all of I knew that was common. I knew a lot of my friends through the same thing, and that I didn't quite appreciate the on me until, you know, until to look back on these things. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:At as you write in your you redevelop a relationship &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:You went and but that was not as as you thought it would be. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, it was pleasant he really had his life together. He was living with my step mom a happy home life, and I think in I was searching for I think I was in the 8th grade But I also realized that I to my grandma, right, because even even when my sister and I we spent a ton of time And as mom sort of struggled with and more time with our grandparents. So there was this real weird moment and I recognized that he as people understood it, but I to my grandma's house and that's eventually what I did. You know, I don't think I that in my own mind, and in of become my chief caretaker. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. So you lived with your it wasn't as happy an You then moved in with your maternal &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Right. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And then. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Papaw, he had &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Let's He was very close to you. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So the shock of his passing away, &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, it, I in all the ways that the death of a parent effects a Papaw, because of the because of the revolving door Papaw was the closest to a dad during those He was the person who He was the person who made sure we And also, he was just an and my sister, and my grandmother. You know, I always had this things would be taken He was always the person when family drama was happening. He was the person who who never flew off the handle, who, she had a temper, and Papaw didn't. And so, I think that it of different and negative ways. But the way that it effected me most of all is really what I understood as a kid, that Papaw was the glue that And I realized it in a non when he wasn't there, just what, &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So, you then at one point, she was violent to deal with, and she as you refer it in the book. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Right. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And what was an experience where, in and saved you from your mother. Is that fair? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah. You know, I think about this story you know, I was 12 or 13 when if maybe it wasn't quite I think, in part, that's just and I think in some they try to remember things in a on people that they love. And I certainly love my mom, and we're doing pretty well But, you know, yeah, I mean, I thought that and I thought that mom was and this was in a car, the and she was certainly, didn't And so I got out of the car and who called the police, and the and she was, and she was So you know, that was obviously a There's no other way to cut it. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And after live with your grandmother, with your mother after &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, for a time, You know, again, I was always living at a time, even when things And so it wasn't that different of a departure from But yeah, I went and lived and then eventually went But, again, that was sort of the &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. And when you were growing up, I didn't have the experiences but I wouldn't have the ability when I was 12 or 10 or 9. How do you recall that, Or how did you know &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, well, I being able to rely on your So, you know, a lot of this stuff as possible with my aunt, or You know, what happened here? This is sort of, you know, here's of this particular story. You know, what am I leaving out? What am I missing? What haven't I quite And I do think, you know, going to the book, that's one of the because I tried to make them This wasn't just sort of I really tried to make it a But as I said in the introduction, but they're certainly And I think that they're pretty as you can with what &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Now as you go obviously, your grandmother That must have been Were you living with her &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: No, I was in This was actually just a few months And, you know. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:You were you were getting ready, from high school you &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, that's right. No, no, no, no. So, well, I lived with her And left for the marines, &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So you you write in your book, for college. And then either you thought you or you weren't sure What was the reason you didn't go &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, it was both. Definitely I didn't I thought that, you know, I had at to recognize that this maybe to have anything in the way of that if I screwed this college thing that would be me blowing And so, you know, because of that I and I thought that I was in where if I went to college, I would have taken advantage of it. You know the cost part of it was as well. You know, it wasn't just the cost. I mean, obviously I knew that I'd and we sort of knew that there like that that I'd be But even with that, I knew that it would be a pretty But it was more actually that made college seem so imposing. You know, if you think out the financial aid paperwork. What is your dad's annual income? What is your dad's address? I mean, at that time, to my legal father in 6 or 7 years. Going and finding that information of detective work. You know, there were sort on these massive loans, and it was from high school, and me, and and in some ways, a through this entire administrative in my family, had gone through, and I didn't feel comfortable &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. So you just said, I'll to the Marine recruiter, Or? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, a similar version of what happened. I mean, at that point, so there of grandchildren, my two and my two younger cousins, and of in the Marine Corp, both So I was encouraged pretty who was in the Marine Corp. She about how you're going and more importantly you're for college, you should just that'll be great for you. You'll, you know, you'll get out you'll gain some financial and you should really go &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. So you signed up for the Marine that was a good idea? Your mother? Your? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, I, you know, it's definitely a patriotic so people were proud of me. But they were not especially happy this is, I guess I We had just invaded Iraq. We'd been involved in There was definitely some real about what joining what I was getting myself into. And Mamaw, especially, You know, I think, in some ways, into the Marine Corp you know, almost as a betrayal. That you're going off and leaving of myself, you could get hurt. And I think that was, but ultimately she understood &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:All right. So you went to basic training. And what was that like? Did you, I mean, fear you couldn't &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I was never afraid I mean, maybe when I was in high of the physical demands, You know, but a drill instructor if you think those drill they'll be nothing like &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Right. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: And I really thought, that so long as I could the psychological part would be and that was true, you know. Marine Corp boot camp is definitely in a weird way, it's kind of fun. Maybe it's Stockholm Syndrome. But I know a lot of Marines who actually enjoyed their and I was no different &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Your recounting your book, she Did that rub off on you? Or how did you avoid, or to use those words around you? Or you didn't say anything about it? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, well, I think of how foul my language is. You know, I definitely try to to my grandma, just she loved a dramatic [ Laughter ] And, I, you know, you to the U.S. Marine Corp, like a sailor doesn't come from of the Department of the Navy. And I think that I definitely have to like operate in civil society. [ Laughter ] But it's like ingrained in me, and &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:All right. So you're in the Marine Corp, and then you go over to Iraq. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And were in one piece, or you weren't &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, when they're about is worried about whether The thing to remember meaning a military occupation we had lost some people in my MOS to but it wasn't quite, you know, about the danger as maybe I would working in the infantry, So I was worried about it, but and recognize that, you it'll certainly be more dangerous but I'll probably end up, you know, most Marines end up &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. So after four years, you &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And then you &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:You felt &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yep. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:But you of your college contemporaries, &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So why do not that it's not a but did you consider &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, some [ Applause ] Well, you know, I think of make these decisions seem I mean, honestly, the reason I because I grew up rooting and of my friends had gone there. I was not nearly as, maybe, thoughtful about my college I had a great experience there, and But it was basically luck that I wasn't sort of thinking as smartly &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. So normally people go to &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And through Ohio State in two years. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:How do you &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, you you go during the summer, that you gained during the Those three things were able to cut a couple of years off. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. So how did you support yourself. Where would the money Did you have grants then, or the Marine Corp salary &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, So I was no longer in the Marine from the government anymore. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:But &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure. So, you know, a little bit of that I incurred, you know, some of the subsidized loans, had the GI Bill, which I was but I used some of the And then I, you know, I So it sort of, those of income were enough &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. So you graduate in two years. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yep. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And then you &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:But as there aren't as many Yale or Harvard Law &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Though But how did you happen to which is a great law school, as or some other school in the Midwest? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah. So this is another thing where I wasn't thinking You know, I applied to a few and sort of was thinking going to one of those schools, one of my best friends, he was the who, himself was a lawyer, you know, and you think you can get into this is right after the I've got friends from law school so you should try to get because that'll be your against unemployment. And so then I actually ended up and then reapplying and &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:But you were but in college you did much better. How did you change from a mediocre, &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, I think average in high school. You know, a couple of things, right? I mean, so one, I was This goes back to me being ready I sort of appreciated that it to just a responsibility that And so I just tried harder. I think, you know, paying for it and and up maybe gave me some I was lucky to be able to go there. You know, but I also thought a lot about my grandma when You know, this is a woman when she was 14 years old She had not had many she was super, super smart. And I just thought if Mamaw can sacrifice all those like this, I should and I should actually try hard. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. So you go to Yale Law School. Now Yale Law School is about into in the United States, many people go there from similar kind of colleges. Did you feel a little out of place There weren't that many as I recall, from Ohio State. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, I was the only Ohio You know, it was weird that there were high schools, where there were more students from than there were of my University, which just struck me But yeah, it was definitely It was more of a culture than any place I had ever been. It was more of a culture more than Ohio State, you know, it was sort of astonishing just and the backgrounds were relative to where I came from. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Now, another Bill Clinton, came from Arkansas, take a lot of pride and it's a great state, and so forth. Did you say, I'm a hillbilly from I'm really different, as you guys, or how did you fit in? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I don't know that I'm a hillbilly from [ Laughter ] But I think that definitely came through in the way that I mean, I was definitely a even in undergrad. I think everyone, or I think everyone knew But, yeah, I don't know if &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. So how did you do at, how did Were you academically at or at the bottom, or where were you? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I did okay. I mean, I don't think I was I think my wife was at the top, which is why she's clerking I definitely didn't do as The weird thing about Yale, for of these law schools, is they so it's actually really where you rank relative My sense is that I was doing fine. I wasn't at the bottom of the pack, but I certainly wasn't And I was sort of, I was &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. So you wrote your way onto the Yale of the most prestigious things And then did you decide that or be a clerk, or what did you &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, so my wife and to go to the Eastern &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:You was she in the same class as you. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, was &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Is Or where is she? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: She probably. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Is I don't see her here. But I thought she was coming. Where is she? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: There she is. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:There she [ Applause ] Okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sorry. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:All right. So you met her, and you &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah. So we were in the same class. So we had an opportunity to clerk which both of our judges, we but they were both in Covington, which is just over the And so it's sort of this perfect clerk for a federal judge, but be that were both really &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:You had to escape Kentucky and then &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, I to escape Kentucky, so much as the &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I've always sort of that I came from, and But yeah, you know, it and a really good year. We both worked for like You know, sometimes people get stuck for great people and &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. So, as I said at the beginning, there were three reasons why I at least in my view. One is, it's very well written, Secondly, the life story so it's very interesting. But the third is, I think, one of so popular, because as the world has changed a fair bit since you conceived &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And now, of the problems of our country, opioid abuse, unemployment, in the Midwest, and a lot of the the roots where you come So let's talk about that for awhile. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Let's talk about the opioid problem, And you growing up, you that drug abuse was a and you think it's gotten worse. And why do you think it's so bad? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, yeah, it's definitely something And I remember when, you know, out that mom was addicted to, you as we called them back then. I just didn't understand it, right, I didn't understand why anybody It wasn't especially common. This was back in the mid 90's, so the problem had not gone Now, of course, in 2017, about the opioid epidemic, which is And so I did feel in some ways into what would later Why has it gotten worse? There are a ton of of different explanations, right? So one is, I think, a lot of these drugs were and they were addictive, and and it caused a lot of problems. I think that you have over prescription problem in some I was just in Southeastern Ohio a who are dealing with this. And they tell me that, you know, out and get into their or get into their parent's into grandma's medicine Well, that's a different And I also think that, you a consequence of some really that exist in these communities. You know, if you have domestic of family instability, if you then people do eventually get, Maybe 50 years ago, they and now they're dealing with it through a substance that's &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:How did, but you know, the opioid problem, maybe some use of marijuana but not really anything So how did you avoid that in the &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, Mamaw was of addiction and was really, I mean, if she found out that or that we had anything to drink, And I think, I think she appreciated and that it clearly had this This is the thing that really ruined of her marriage, was alcoholism, and then it was ruining the And so, I was very much on guard, I'm one of these people who for a headache because I'm like of putting foreign because I've seen addiction You know, I got really sick I had mono. And they gave me this synthetic because I had to, you Anyway, I had this delaudid, I and I remember calling, basically, I know why Mamaw didn't like us to take this stuff, [ Laughter ] So I just think being on guard &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:What You avoided alcohol? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: No, I [ Laughter ] I certainly have never felt that I've been addicted I'm sort of, when they ask you at or twice a week type people. But no, I, I've never to anything except for chocolate &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. Now let's talk about unemployment. As you point out in the book, and places like that, to go north. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:To But those jobs have So you see a lot of of background that you have. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Right. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Can you or worse, and what's being done &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Is it getting, it's certainly getting better just because the economy But I don't think that it's improved where it was 30 or 40 years ago. What I mean is that the number or the steel mill industry employed that hasn't returned in It's not, you know, But I do think that you're significant economic shift And, you know, it's something, honestly I think policy I think that everybody just that folks would get different jobs, into different professions. But what's actually happened of communities get really and that's obviously one of You know, what is there There are, I think, a that we could do about it. You know, the first is that, I think with the fact that you're when you graduate from high in a fast food job, and going And I think that we should I think it's not surprising when that you see people going [ Applause ] But I also think, but to think a little bit about regional economic The way that this has gone for I'm a local municipality, I offer up a restaurant in my New restaurants are fantastic, of long term economic to happen in some of these areas. And I think that's it's all levels of policy makers have to be thinking differently &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Now if as successful as yours, and about at some point, somebody from the or the Republican National Committee to be a member of congress, and maybe something even higher. So have you ever thought about, and have you been importune &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I think Thank you. I appreciate that. [ Laughter ] &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:All right. So, it's, so you would say? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:You wouldn't &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: No, certainly not. You know, yeah, certainly when When you have a book people from various political if you'd be interested &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Have who have these jobs who &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I actually &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Right. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: You know, I've talked you know, not about me running, in this environment do you And they say, yeah, you know, I the problem is we don't So, no. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So, but, or for something, because the you can be a spokesman about opioid addiction, and are you of your career talking about to not be seen as a &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah. I don't know that I want to be seen but I certainly think now that I have this I might as well do something with you know, go and talk There are other issues that So, you know, I've tried to be a of these policy debates, you know, during the health care reform I went on to Capitol Hill and this is how this might this is how this might effect So I try to be a constructive But, you know, we live in an So I think that you have to be and you have to be, you know, you even when you try to you're not actually &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So when you or get involved with did they just want a picture on their book, or did they &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, it depends. It depends on the member on some of the staff members. But no, I found, generally that I've become maybe more cynical since the book came out, just, and spending some time I do feel more optimistic about I think that, by and large, people and care about the policy, and care about what effect it's It's just we happen to and a political time where it's in policy to constructive &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:But not pejoratively, but people or from hillbilly culture, for having exposed some of Or are they upset for having exposed &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I think Right? I mean, you, there are that I'm basically a There are people out there who on really important issues, I think that the thing that I hear you know, when I go and talk about when run into me on the that the book has talked about these like wasn't talked about before, that nobody really wrote Nobody really talked about, you up in a household with a lot of What's it like to grow up in you're really worried about or even pay for more You know, that is the part that's But I also think that, you know, and really diverse, and so you as diverse as any large population. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So what get asked? You're in the speaking circuit a you're a contributor at CNN. &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:What is the asked by audiences about your &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: The question I get it's probably how my I think that's definitely something I get asked a lot how &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Well, &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: And the answer to yeah, she's doing really well. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So she's not married now, &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, she's, yeah, She's doing well. She's been clean for And I think, in some ways, you to play this role, and so I'm I think she's a really good even after five or six times you get and back into relapse, that of climb back out, to and to make another go at it. And that, you know, that's She's incredibly tenacious. [ Applause ] &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Does she that says, J.D. Vance's mother. She doesn't have that &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: She does not. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And what do you have contact with him? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah. Yeah, I actually just from him right when I went up here. Yeah, so dad and I are still You know, he's doing pretty well. He, you know, he's a great guy. And I think that he, you about his grandson and that's and I think that's true &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So you grew up largely &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Now &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: So my sister has has been married for 20 years You know, I think that what to really accomplish, like what we was being able to give our kids and the sense of security She has successfully done Her oldest kid is 18. I have done that for 3 months. [ Laughter ] So I'm hopeful I get there, too. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And today, from high school, they laugh at your or they treat you differently, up with treat you now And wealthy? Do people ask you for money? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, sometimes But that's, you know, But yeah, you know, there who laugh louder at my jokes, but I mean, it's one of about having a successful book, is you definitely realize the people and don't let you get too big for Those are the people &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay. So leaving aside your right now you're not practicing law, the highest calling of mankind, So, why did you choose to go into what I'll call the You're in an area, a narrow niche Why did you choose And you're doing it from and you're also living in &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure. Well, it, so that is right. And what I find so interesting that if it's done well, it can actually help and amazing new companies that didn't exist before, right? And so one of the things that and I think I came into this with that was lifted, is that you know, really frankly call the are those who are figuring out, And I think that when I realized I'd like to be a guy who is trying to go into good places where and where it's going to create a lot but for people on the &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Now, some [ Applause ] Some people write a book, you know, their first book is so successful that they have a hard time They get writer's block because as good as the first book. You don't worry about that problem? &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, I don't know. I think that, I still don't know so I don't know that any or poorly compared to it. It certainly was very successful. And I think that I'd be an idiot if I expected any other But I'll let other people &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So what and what you'd like, you'd be a, who came out of the kind of And now, rightly or wrongly, you're a bit of a role out of your kind of background. As a role model, do you to live a life a certain way? Do you feel you should give back What, how has your life changed &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, yeah, I responsibility, when I go on TV, not to make my entire community Because I think one of the things but I just have accepted as reality, as sort of a spokesperson A lot of times I'm asked to what does the Trump voter I think that's unfair. I don't think that any person could or for the Trump voter at large, that some people see me so I try not to sound like a That's one way that, I think, But, I mean, you know, I mean, a year and a half ago, I was in front of hundreds of people. So it's, it's kind of impossible to It's changed in the way that, you when they go from sitting at and watching Netflix, to sitting &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Like the President of the United I read your book, and you of voter I appeal to, or you haven't &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I've never heard I have heard, you know, at the White House who've said So, but no, I've never gotten the Still waiting. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So, today, you would say you're a very happy and your mother and so you're a very happy person of the book has made &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, yeah. I mean, things are The book has changed my but in definitely a positive way. &gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Well, As I said, I thought I highly recommend it to And those who've read I do think it's very And I want to thank you for a &gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Thanks, David.
