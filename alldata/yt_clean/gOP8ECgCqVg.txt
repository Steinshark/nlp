SOMETIMES IT IS HOMEMADE SOMETIMES IT IS OUR KEY IT IS ALSO THE FACT SAP HAS PRIME -- NOW WE ARE REALLY CONVERT THAT HUGE CUSTOMER BASE THAT DRIVES THE GROWTH. GERMAN CHANCELLOR OLAF SCHOLZ AHEAD OF YOUR RECENT -- TALKING EXPANSION OF SAP IN CHINA.

THROUGH MAY, YOU'LL HEAR FROM AN UPDATE ON STORIES LET'S WE STICK WITH EUROPE, WHERE IS GAINING LIMITS THEM. LEVEL IN ALMOST A YEAR WITH RETURN TO GROWTH. WILL LIKELY STRENGTHEN THE CASE COME AFTER WELL BROADCAST JUNE PAUSE. THE U.S. SANCTIONS THAT WOULD CUT OFF FINANCIAL SYSTEM, ACCORDING TO THE EFFORT IS TO STOP BEIJING'S MILITARY. BLINKEN IS HEADED TO BEIJING SHARES OF SPOTIFY HIGHER IN THE EARNINGS. ROSE 14% YEAR-OVER-YEAR. PLANS TO DO IT AGAIN FOR THE THAT IS YOUR BRIEF. JONATHAN: UP NEXT, THE FED CAN STILL &gt;&gt; THE FED IS REALLY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REALLY THAT THEY WANT TO TAKE THIS JONATHAN: THINKS THEY WILL. CASE FOR FIVE CUTS IN 2024. JONATHAN: POSITIVE BY 0.3 PERCENT ON THE EQUITIES JUST PUSHING A LITTLE YIELDS COMING UP NOWHERE ON THE SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING, THE &gt;&gt; THE FED IS REALLY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STAYING WANT TO TAKE THIS PLUNGE INTO IT WOULD TAKE A REALLY BIG ESTIMATES TO GET TO A PLACE COMPARABLE STAYING ON HOLD. DO I THINK THEY SHOULD CUT, OR AGAIN, IT SEEMS LIKE REALLY THE WANT TO. JONATHAN: COOPERATE? INVESTORS LOOKING AHEAD TO FOR WHEN THE CENTRAL BANK MAY CITI'S ANDREW HOLLENHORST MOST LIKELY FIRST CUT IN JUNE TO FALL TO 2.7 PERCENT OUR BASE CASE IS FOR 125 BASIS THIS YEAR. ANDREW IS WITH US. SOMETHING LIKE FIVE CUTS FOR PUSHBACK. BAR IS LOW FOR THAT MOVE? DEFINITELY HAD SOME PUSHBACK IF YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE TO GET TO THE FIRST CUT. WITH THAT. INFLATION PRINTS. THIS IDEA THAT INFLATION IS WE THINK IT IS STRUCTURALLY BUT IT IS STRUCTURALLY MORE THAT MEANS IF WE GET STRONGER PRINCE. THINK IT GOES BACK TO THE THE PRIOR GUEST. SHOULD IT BE BUT IT PROBABLY WILL BE ENOUGH STARTED WITH THESE RATE CUTS. IT HAS BEEN WHACK-A-MOLE THE EVERY SINGLE DATA POINT, HIGHER, AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE GOING LOWER AGAIN. FADING, THAT YOU SEE THIS ANDREW: COULD HELP THE FED OUT. OPTICALLY WE WILL GET SOFTER I AM PRETTY CONVINCED INFLATION KIND OF STABLE, RELIABLE WAY. CAN HELP TO THAT, ONE THING IS CAR INSURANCE HAS GONE UP BY YEAR. THAT IS A REAL PHENOMENON. APPROXIMATELY WHAT IS REFLECTED BUT WE KNOW AUTO PRICES HAVE AUTO PRICES HAVE COME DOWN OFF THAT IS ONE COMPONENT THAT CAN THAT IS IN CORE SERVICES, IN SHELTER, AGAIN, THERE ARE WE HAVE HAD HOUSE PRICES THAT BUT WE SHOULD SEE SOME SLOWING, OVER THE WAS OF THE YEAR, SO DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER SEEING IN YOUR AUTO INSURANCE IT MAKE ME FEEL THAT AT LEAST CONSISTENT WITH THE DATA. LISA: ALREADY COUNTER CONSENSUS, RATE CUT PRICE INTO THE MARKET WHAT IS THE FEAR FACTOR FOR YOU AND USE ANY EXCUSE TO CUT RATES OF THIS RALLY WE HAVE SEEN IN BOND MARKETS, THE A LOT OF TO THE STICKINESS OF INFLATION ANDREW: WRONG. IT IS A VALID CONCERN. NUMBERS COMING IN MORE CORPORATE EARNINGS MORE WE HAVE TO THINK BACK TO WHAT WE HAD A BIG FISH PIVOT ON THE MODE OF WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE WE NEED TO SEE TO GET TO THAT THAT RAN UP VERY SIGNIFICANTLY. STIMULUS INTO THE ECONOMY. BUT IT IS DOING THAT AT THE THAT IS A RISK THE FED IS IF THE FED WERE TO CUT RATES TIMES THIS YEAR, HOW MUCH DOES POINT -- 3% OR 3.5% FOR THE TO GET THE FIVE CUTS, WE HAVE ACTIVITY OR LABOR MARKET DATA. WE HAVE A LOT OF INDICATE WE MAY SEE THAT LATER LABOR MARKET, BUT SO LONG AS THE FED WILL BE A LITTLE MORE TALKED ABOUT, AND THAT WOULD QUARTERLY PAY, SO YOU HAVE THE THEN INTO DECEMBER -- WE HAVE PEAKED AND COME OFF OF THAT A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE THAT FINANCIAL CONDITIONS, BUT THAT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WILL BE YOU ARE NAVIGATING BETWEEN YOU HAVE INFLATION ON THE ONE THE OTHER HAND, AND IT IS ALL RIGHT. JONATHAN: US LATER, AND HE IS TALKING ADJUSTMENTS, IT CUT HERE, A CUT IS IT DOMINATING CONVERSATION VERY DIFFERENT TO A MIDCYCLE WOULD YOU FRAME IT AS A ADJUSTMENT MAY BE AWAY FROM 125 BASIS POINTS, AND WHAT ONE TO THE OTHER? ANDREW: ACTIVITY DATA, THE LABOR MARKET WHERE WE ARE SEEING SIGNS LIKE KIND OF LATENT WEAKNESS IN THE EMERGE MORE CLEARLY IN THE DATA. THINK THE FED IS TALKING ABOUT MIDCYCLE ADJUSTMENT, THE IDEA DOWN, YOUR REAL RATE IS MOVING LOWER. JONATHAN: COMMUNICATION HAS SHIFTED. THE SHIFT. JUST RATES, BUT WHEN THEY ENOUGH, DON'T YOU THINK THE WE WANT TO CUT AT ALL COSTS? THERE HAS DEFINITELY BEEN SOME THAT IS PARTLY THE INFLATION IT IS ALSO THE ACTIVITY DATA. DATA, THAT PROBABLY DOES NOT RESTRICTIVE ON POLICY RATES, URGENCY. HEARING FROM THEM, THERE IS NO AS LONG AS THERE IS NO URGENCY HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT ENOUGH, HOW LONG DO WE NEED TO THAT IS THE STANDARD MONETARY YOU GET RATES TO A LEVEL THAT YOU TALK ABOUT, THIS IS WHERE MOHAMED EL-ERIAN -- ANNMARIE: SHOW A FEW WEEKS AGO AND WAS EVERYONE GOT IT WRONG IN 2021 BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT LISTENING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES. THEIR EARNINGS YOU THINK SHOW PRESSURES ARE STARTING TO IT IS NOT THAT CLEAR FROM WANING IN INFLATIONARY YOU'RE NOT ASK CLEAR IN TERMS HEARING CONSUMER DEMAND HAS PEOPLE EXPECTED, PARTICULARLY WHEN WE GET THE GDP PRINT THIS FLAT OR MAYBE EVEN DECLINING IN HAS HELD UP. DISINFLATIONARY PRESSURE, WHICH WHEN YOU LISTEN TO SOME OF SOUNDS LIKE THEY THINK THEY THAT IS AN ISSUE WHEN YOU ARE LISA: QUESTIONS FOR YOU FROM WATCHES THIS BE REAL, BECAUSE WE HAVE CUTS? CALLS YOU GET. PROBABILITY DO YOU PUT ON THE IS A 0%? DO YOU SAY IT IS ON THE TABLE? COULD WE EVENTUALLY GET TO A WE COULD STAY AT THIS LEVEL AND RESTRICTIVE AND YOU HAVE THAT IS THE KEY -- DO YOU HAVE INFLATION. AT ABOUT 5% INFLATION A YEAR SOMETHING THAT, BY MOST PERCENT OR 4% INFLATIONARY. I THINK THAT IS GIVING FED POLICY RATES ARE RICHARD BOVE. JONATHAN: THANK YOU. THIS IS SOUNDING MORE AND MORE WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT A FEW THE CALLS FOR CUTS NOW SOUND OUT OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN AWAY. MONTHS. I HEARD THE SAME IDEA, TALKING HAD THE FIRST HIKE AND HAD TO ONE. LISA: ZERO CONVICTION RIGHT NOW WHEN WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE WE DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT IN THE IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHERE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. A LOT OF PEOPLE EQUALLY COMING UP IN THE SECOND HOUR OF DARRELL CRONK OF WELLS FARGO, CRAIG -- ZACH GRIFFITHS OF LIVE FROM NEW YORK, THIS IS &gt;&gt; THE DATA COULD CONTINUE TO &gt;&gt; THE DATA IS GLARING. CORPORATE PROFITABILITY LOOKS &gt;&gt; WE HAVE HAD THIS EASING THE ENVIRONMENT THAT HAS BASICALLY FOSTERED ASSET PRICES ACROSS &gt;&gt; THE MAG 7 HAS BEEN &gt;&gt; BALANCE SHEETS ARE QUITE ENVIRONMENT IS TOUGH, IT IS OPPORTUNITIES. &gt;&gt; THIS IS &quot;BLOOMBERG WITH JONATHAN FERRO, LISA HORDERN. JONATHAN: THE BIG CHALLENGE THIS EARNINGS LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, GOOD SURVEILLANCE&quot; TESLA, THE LONGEST LOSING WEAKNESS. BY 0.6 PERCENT. AFTERNOON. EARLY THIS MORNING. LISA: WERE JUST GREAT -- IF YOU FOCUS AND YOU FOCUS ON TRUCKS AND YOU SIDE. NOT RIGHT NOW. RISING, ALSO INCREASING THEIR THIS SHOWS THE DISTINCTION MARKET AND THE REST OF THE WE SEE THAT FROM INDUSTRY TO NEED TO TALK ABOUT TECH AND THE APPLE DOWN YOUR TODAY BY ALMOST AND IT IS MORE BAD NEWS, THIS I FOUND SALES IN CHINA FALLING YEAR. ANNMARIE: CHINA, GIVEN THE FACT THAT OF THEIR MARKET, WHERE THEY FROM. AT THE SAME TIME, HUAWEI, IN PROFITS 70%. CHINESE CONSUMERS STILL WANT APPLE FOR A NATIONAL CHAMPION -- QUALITY -- HUAWEI. LISA: ARE THEY GOING TO COMPETE IN THEY HAVE TO PULL DOWN PRICES. PRICES IN THE U.S.? THEY HAVE ENOUGH -- IT IS A BIG REPORT COMING UP NEXT COMING UP, WE WILL CATCH UP FARGO, WITH STOCKS SNAPPING A ZACH GRIFFITHS OF CRITICIZE RATE CUT. TECH EARNINGS KICKOFF. WRITING WE REITERATE OUR FOCUS PORTFOLIOS AND EXPECTANCY EQUITIES OVER THE NEXT 6 TO 12 WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES NOW, RIGHT NOW, YOU STILL HAVE TO THE QUALITY LEADERSHIP, SOME OF THE PROCYCLICAL NATURE WE ARE FADING A LITTLE BIT MORE FINANCIALLY'S -- WE ARE FADING YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THOSE PAYING UP IN VALUATION. INTERESTING. THERE ARE ONLY TWO SECTORS IN POSITIVE SALES GROWTH FROM LAST IS FINANCIALS AND UTILITIES. SOMETHING LIKE TECH IS DOWN 8% QUARTER OVER QUARTER. JONATHAN: SCREAMING &quot;BUY&quot;? MISSED THE 5% YIELD IN OCTOBER, THEY WOULD SAY, ABSOLUTELY. PEOPLE DON'T COME ON THE WHY IS THAT? DARRELL: TO PICKING UP PENNIES IN FRONT PEOPLE ARE GRABBING FOR BASIS CURVE. YOU ARE GRABBING FOR 5, 10, 15, HAVE A BOND FOLIO THAT HAS A RATES TO DROP 1%, I MAKE 700 OR ON DURATION IS THE RIGHT ONE. THINK ALMOST THE ENTIRE WALL YIELD CURVE HAS CHANGED IN A TALKING ABOUT IT. OUT, WE ARE ALMOST TABLE TOP POINTS OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WITH JUST A VERY MILD LITTLE BIT OF STEEPNESS. BUYING INTO THE SOFT LANDING CURVE? KILLING THE INVERTED. BASIS POINTS IN EARNING. THAT IS TELLING YOU A DIFFERENT A LOT OF THE HISTORICAL STUDIES THAT THE SIGNAL VERSUS NOISE, TELLS YOU MUCH MORE INFORMATION OR THE TAIL OF THE CURVE. SIDE, BECAUSE THAT SITE IS SOME TOUGHER WATERS TO NAVIGATE CIRCLE TO WHERE WE THINK YOU LISA: TECH CARE THAT SEEMS LIKE ONE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, AND GO. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHERE AND IS THIS A BROADER THINGS HAVE TOO HIGH, THEY HAVE MORE ROOM A LITTLE BIT OF THE LATTER. I MENTIONED ABOUT 20% QUARTER 8% DECLINE IN REVENUE. CHALLENGING TIMES. UNDER THIS HEADING OF BIG CHANGE INSIDE OF TECH OVER THE EVERYBODY NOW, AND WE THINK HARDWARE. FROM CAPITAL LIGHT SOFTWARE ALL ABOUT AI DATA CENTERS, EVEN THE BIG GOOGLES AND HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT IS A DURABLE TREND FOR THE WITHIN TECH, IF YOU'RE GOING TO ARE STILL MISSING THE FROM THE LAST 10 TO 15 YEARS OF BASICALLY BEING ALL THE RAGE. GOOGLE STARTED WITH $100 HAS PROBABLY BECOME ONE OF THE NOW IT WILL BE ALL ABOUT WHO HARDWARE AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO RATION. LISA: COMES ON THE SHOW HAS LESS AND WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HAD THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL FOR HERE -- LITTLE BIT GOES BACK TO WHAT YOU ARE STARTING TO SEE, THE PRIOR SEGMENT -- THERE IS THIS BIFURCATED -- BIG BUSINESS BUSINESS CONFIDENCE. IN TECH, -- IN TECH NON-TECH MANUFACTURING SPEND. PUTTING YOUR INVESTMENTS IN WHERE STRENGTH RESIDES AND THE REALITY IS THERE IS SO MUCH IT IS DRIVING ALL ASSET PRICES LOOK AT THE FTSE SETTING OFF A AN ALL-TIME HIGH, THE NIKKEI TYPICALLY A RISK OFF ASSET. ALL-TIME HIGH. EVERYTHING. RISK ON OR RISK OFF ASSETS AT AT SOME POINT, THAT STARTS TO WHERE DO I REALLY WANT TO HAVE 12 MONTHS, AND WE THINK THAT CONTINUES. ANNMARIE: WANT EXPOSURE? DARRELL: IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE WORLD, YOU STILL WANT TO BE COUNTRY THERE. IF THE BOJ HAS TO INTERVENE AT A 34 YEAR LOW -- JONATHAN: WE BACI -- NOW BASICALLY 155. YOU HAVE THE BOJ TRYING TO BUT EQUITIES THERE ARE DOING I THINK EUROPE IS AN YOU ALMOST KIND OF HAVE TO LOOK NOSE A LITTLE BIT WHEN YOU GO WHEN YOU DRILL DOWN TO THE TO SEE PARTICULARLY GREAT BUT THE MARKET THERE CONTINUE FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT MAY BE A CASE WHERE DEVELOPED MARKETS THE FIRST QUARTER, DEVELOPED OUTPERFORMED THE S&amp;P BY 0.2%. THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME. THE PSYCHOLOGY AROUND EUROPE -- HERE, SOMEONE SAY GOOD FOR INVESTMENTS. OF TWO THINGS.

PLACE TO BE IN TERMS OF A IT IS INTERESTING, TO YOUR AND LOOK AT CHINA OVER THE LAST BEEN A GOOD INVESTMENT. TRADE, AT MOMENTS IN TIME, BUT INDUSTRY -- INDICES AND LOOK AT NOT BEEN A GREAT, SUSTAINABLE, SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE THERE THERE. OVER THE YEARS, YOU CAN PLAY HAVING TO HAVE THE DIRECT THE BENEFITS OF THE CHINESE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE. ANNMARIE: JUST BEFORE WE LET YOU GO. TECH EARNINGS, PC AND SPENDING WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO GET A SENSE OF WHETHER WE ARE DIVERGENCE YOU HAVE BEEN AUCTIONS ARE ALWAYS KEY. YOU HEAR THIS ALL THE TIME. WEEK -- HAVE BEEN WEAK. PCE WILL COME INTO .7, 2.8, AND IN CPI. IT IS EARNINGS. PUTS YOU IN THE 50TH PERCENTILE THEME OF EARNINGS SEASON SO FAR ORDER OF THE MARKET CAP WEAK TOPSIDE DEMAND WITH A GOOD SOME GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS. SOFTENING AND WEAKENING. DEFENDING THE MARGIN LINE, BUT YOU NEED TOPLINE GROWTH TO KEEP IF WE ARE GOING TO GET TO THIS THAT EVERYBODY BELIEVES THE S&amp;P GOT TO GO. COMING HERE. LOOKING GOOD. UP. JONATHAN: THIS WAS SOLID. DARRELL CRONK OF WELLS FARGO. ELSEWHERE. WITH DANI BURGER -- BLOOMBERG I AM SURE THIS IS COMING AS A KOLANOVIC WARNING THAT THE MACRO RISK ALONGSIDE HIGHER ELEVATED OIL PRICES. FOR SOME TIME.

UKRAINE EIGHT, ISRAEL AID, AND AS THE SIDEBAR PACKAGE THAT TIKTOK IF IT DOES NOT DIVEST IT INCLUDES THE REPO ACT, THAT TO SEIZE RUSSIAN ASSETS TO IT INVOLVES -- ALL THOSE THINGS PACKAGE. TOGETHER TO TRY TO FORCE THE THINGS TO IT AS WE ALL KNOW, A VOTE ON THE TIKTOK BAN. THIS PACKAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS WHY WE EXPECT THE NEXT DAY OR TWO. ANNMARIE: AMENDMENTS TO THIS LARGE IT IS UNLIKELY. HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE HOUSE OR YOU WOULD HAVE TO PULL THEM WE ALREADY HAD A LOT OF TURMOIL THE SENATE IS LOOKING TO GET DOOR, AND I THINK THEY ARE PIECES, EVEN THOUGH THERE WILL MEMBERS MIGHT LIKE. ANNMARIE: IS THE IDEA OF THE PRESIDENT SHARPLY WHEN IT COMES TO DO YOU THINK IN ACTUALITY THAT BIDEN ADMINISTRATION? JEANNETTE: THIS IS A BILL -- IT IS CALLED IT WAS INCLUDED IN THE FOREIGN PREVIOUSLY LAST FALL. DAY WINDOW FOR IT TO BE ENACTED. DAYS WHEN IT WAS INCLUDED IN THAT MEANS IT WOULD BASICALLY ELECTION. SANCTIONS BEFORE THE ELECTION. PRESIDENT CAN THEN DO GEOPOLITICAL SITUATION IS THEN. THAT POINT. SO WE DO NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON ELECTION. LISA: ARE EXPECTING THE ONLY BIG MOVE ADMINISTRATION AHEAD OF THE TO COME AGAINST CHINESE GOODS DO YOU EXPECT THE RECENT TRIP BELIEVE HE LEAVES TODAY, WILL OF THOSE TARIFFS THAT PEOPLE JEANNETTE: SHOWED UP IN CHINA A BELIEVE A THE THINGS SHE WAS FOCUSED ON, MORE OF ITS SURPLUS NOW, AND DUMPING, NOT ONLY IN THE UNITED THEN YOU HAD PRETENDS THAT HE CHINESE STEEL AND ALUMINUM CARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT MAY BE LOW COST EXPORT WILL MEAN FOR SO THAT WILL BE ON THE RADAR BLINKEN IS ALSO TIME TO FOCUS TRYING TO SUPPLY RUSSIA WITH WAR AGAINST UKRAINE. OF THE OTHER ISSUES THEY HAVE TARIFFS MAY NOT BE SOME THING QUICKLY. WE HAD THE U.S. SHE WANTS TO APPLY SOLAR WILL SEE AS MUCH OF AN IMPACT BUT THIS WILL BE THE CONSTANT AND CHINA, WHERE THEY ARE LOTS OF ACTIONS AGAINST ONE LISA: HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THE THE POTENTIAL THAT PRESIDENT PRESIDENT AFTER NOVEMBER, OR JANUARY NEXT YEAR, THAT THAT IS U.S. TO COME UP WITH A COHESIVE PLAN IT IS INTERESTING.

BACKDROP AND YOU HAVE ANOTHER ALLOWS THE FED TO START THAT TAKES IT BACK TO ANYTHING BACK TOWARDS NEUTRAL BY THE END I WONDER IF UNDERNEATH YOUR ARE GOING BACK TO AN INFLATION ECONOMY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW BASICALLY TWO PERCENT BUT THAT IS OUR BASE CASE. BACK TO AROUND 2.25% AS DID MAYBE NOT BELOW 2% AT AN THE 2010S EXPANSION. FED. MOVE BACK TOWARD THAT 4.5% BY THAT IS REALLY NOT A REAL NEAR NEUTRAL IN TERMS OF GOING LOW-LEVEL WE EXPERIENCED IN THE THAT SUGGEST THE CURRENT RATE THEN SOME.

ZACH: YOU ARE NOT. WILL SEE AT THE END OF THIS WERE TALKING ABOUT A MIDCYCLE WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A RATE ZERO. ACCOMMODATIVE BY THE END OF MAYBE NOT BY THE END OF NEXT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE RATE NORMALIZATION OR RECALIBRATION NORMALIZED A BIT COMING OUT OF POTENTIAL AND WE DON'T NEED A AT. IF YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH INFLATION HAS COME DOWN, THE BELOW POTENTIAL GROWTH AND IT ADJUSTMENT TO THE STANCE OF FOR THE SAKE OF SCENARIO IS RIGHT, GET ONE OR TWO RATE WHAT DOES CREDIT DO? ZACH: LITTLE BIT FROM WHERE WE ARE WE CAN CIG MOVING TO 130 BASIS MAYBE A MOVE UP TO 500 BASIS NOT RETESTING THE RECENT WHEN YOU CONSIDER POLICY NOT EXPECTING IT WILL CAUSE SPREADS THE CONCERN WE HAD COMING IN AT IN A GREATER FOCUS IF THE FED THAN ANTICIPATED.

WHAT THAT MEANS IS THE WAS OVERSTATED. ELEVATED THAN WE THOUGHT. BOOST GROWTH AS WE GO AHEAD. FACTOR. LISA: MIDCYCLE ADJUSTMENT IS NOT OF HARD LANDING. SEEING IN THE EARNINGS REPORT, VERY REAL. THE FACT THAT IF RATES REMAIN OF THE POPULATION WILL STRUGGLE I AM TALKING ABOUT COMPANIES FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT IS CONDITIONS. ECONOMY THAT YOU HAVE FOR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. MORE NORMAL PRE-COVID GETS DRAWN DOWN. ENVIRONMENT IS ROBUST CONSUMER WE SEE GDP GROWTH THAT LOOKS WE SEE EMPLOYMENT GAINS ABOVE WE SEE HOUSES ADDING MEANINGFUL ALL OF THAT IS SUPPORTIVE FOR ECONOMY AND SOMETHING THE FED ANNMARIE: WHAT ABOUT 2025? GIVEN THAT WE MIGHT HAVE VERY OF WASHINGTON? MATTHEW: IT IS A CHALLENGE TO THINK THE I THINK THAT COULD BE HIGHLY OUTCOME WE GET.

MATTHEW: UNLIKELY ABSENT A WEAKENING IN TO GET A CUT BY JULY I THINK DECELERATION IN THE INFLATION WE HAVE NOW HAD THREE INFLATION OBJECTIVE. ACCELERATING. DOWN IN THAT TIME. AND CONVINCING PRINTS OF WEAKER WEAKENING OF THE LABOR MARKET. INFLATION MIX THAT MAKES YOU MEAN AND MEDIAN HAVE REMAINED IT IS NOT ABOUT OUTLIERS. THE CLEVELAND FED. OF ELEVATED LEVELS.

UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS TESLA SAID REPORT EARNINGS SHARES DOWN 43% YEAR-TO-DATE. POINT AS INVESTORS WORRY ABOUT ELON MUSK WIDELY PROJECTED TO MODEL IN FAVOR OF DEVELOPING A VIJAY RAKESH JOINS US NOW. WORK THROUGH A LOT OF ISSUES. PROGRAM HAS BEEN DO WE HAVE AN TESLA PROBLEM. WHICH ONE IS IT? I THINK IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF IN TERMS OF INDUSTRY WE HAVE LAST FEW YEARS. ROUND OF EARLY ADOPTERS SO TOUGHER AS MOST OF THE LOW YOURS IN THE EV INDUSTRY FACED CHINA. ON TESLA SPECIFICALLY, YOU HAVE INVESTORS WERE LOOKING FOR THE UNCLEAR IF THAT IS -- WE SEE WHICH IN THIS CASE BETWEEN 2024 MODELS COMING TO MARKET. IF WE DO NOT HAVE GROWTH, HOW IT IS A QUESTION WELLS FARGO WHAT KIND OF VALUATIONS PUT ON IT IS A TALE OF TWO SCENARIOS. CHALLENGING GROWTH EXPECTATIONS REFRESH. LONGER-TERM YOU STILL HAVE THE MUCH ON TRACK AND YOU CAN SEE SIGNIFICANTLY. PLACING THEIR CHIPS. ALL THE GLOBAL EMS, EVERYONE'S THE EV ROAD NOW. NEAR-TERM YOU'RE FACING A EV MARKET STILL NEEDS TO BRING THE MODEL TWO WOULD HAVE BEEN A FLEET BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THERE THAT. LISA: WHAT GETS US TO $195 A SHARE PROJECT? VIJAY: I THINK A LOT OF THE PULLBACK TRENDS IN SLOWING SALES, BUT TIMELINE, ESPECIALLY WITH IT THE MORE CLARITY ELON MUSK AND THE BETTER CHANCE HE WOULD HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL. VIRGIN SO JAN. THEY WILL GET LITERALLY COME STANDARDS. IT IS STILL A ROADMAP THAT WE COULD SEE SOMETHING NEAREST. THE BIG FOCUS HAS TO TRACK. LISA: ELON MUSK WHICH UP TO THE HOW MUCH WOULD HIS TONE MATTER GUYS OR WHETHER HE EXCORIATES WE HAVE TO SEPARATE THE SHOULD BE LATE TO THE EXECUTION AS TESLA HAS DONE AND ACTIVE BALANCE SHEET. GETTING THE PRODUCT ROADMAP ACT ON TRACK. THAT IS REALLY THE VALUATION OF THE PRODUCT ROADMAP AND HOW AS IT DEALS WITH THIS PRICE WAR GET RID OF THE CHEAPER VERSION I THINK WE ARE NOT THERE YET. I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN SUPPORTS THAT MONEY GETS DELAYED THE INVESTOR FOCUS WILL BE. THE EARNINGS FOR THE CURRENT ESTIMATES FOR THE CURRENT SIGNIFICANTLY. MUCH OF A CONCERN AROUND WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE FOR THE QUARTER -- THAT IS REALLY WHERE THE THAT IS WHERE ALL OF THE ANNMARIE: ROBOTAXI, YOU WENT THROUGH BEFORE AUGUST. THIS DOES NOT WHAT YOU NEED TO HEAR FROM ELON WE CAN SEE THIS PROJECT. VIJAY: CHALLENGE. THE REAL QUESTION WOULD BE WHAT WHAT IS THE PERFORMANCE? WHAT ARE THE STANDARDS FEEDBACK? THIS. I THINK THERE ARE AGAINST. THAT MAKES ME THINK ALSO SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL IT IS WHAT EVERYONE WANTS TO WE HAVE SEEN THIS MULTIPLE GET PUSHED OUT. AT THIS POINT 2027 OR 2028 IS CHANCE OF SEEING GLOBAL TAXES. JONATHAN: ABOUT -- ELON MUSK HAS NOT HE IS INCREDIBLY UNIQUE THE ACROSS VARIOUS INDUSTRIES. PAYPAL. INNOVATIONS IN HEALTH CARE. SPACEX AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT MORE RECENTLY THE EXPERIENCE OF POLARIZATION OF THE MAN HIMSELF. CLIENTS ABOUT LEADERSHIP TO PORTION OF THE CONSUMER BASE? WHEN YOU LOOK AT GENIUSES THE LONG.
