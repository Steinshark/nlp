Is it all right if I go with you girls? Of course not, you loser. Ghazel, tell us a funny joke. There's an end that can't walk, why? Because it is wearing high heels. Someone is standing and watching us. They call me crazy, I will show them. I wish I could have my revenge from the bullying girls. Ghazel, what happened to your face? What? What happened to my skin?! Reem, you have a mustache. A mustache! What happened to my face! Girls, what happened? Sousou, your teeth are lost! What happened to my teeth? They deserve it. I am going to the doctor. Me too. I didn't mean for it to go this far. So that they repent and never bully me again. I always take care of my skin and now it is ruined, I have to go visit the doctor. And my face is full of hair! Oh God, who did this to us? I don't know. How are we going to go to school looking like this? Thank you my diary, it was the best day at school. Shfa, go on and clean your room. I am tired.

Wow, it is now all organized. Thank you diary. Hi! Mashallah, you came to school with makeup! You are grounded to stand. Okay. I wish the teacher would allow me to come to school with makeup. Shfa, you are allowed to come into class wearing makeup. Yes! How are you doing Reem? Why are you covering your face? There is a smell coming out of the trash. I am going to leave for 2 minutes and come back, don't make any noise. Are you eating sweets in the class? You are punished, give me the sweets. Here you go. All your sweets will be confiscated. I wish the teacher would give us our sweets back and let us eat in the class. It is all right to eat sweets in class girls so I will give them back to you. Shfa! Sousou! Bon appetit girls. Girls I will ask you questions and they will be graded. First question: what is the biggest star in the galaxy? The moon. It is false, the right answer is the sun. Shfa. Your grade is F. I got zero, my mother will be mad at me. I wish the teacher will grant me a great mark. Teacher! Teacher! Teacher! Me! Me! What is the longest river in the world? The Amazon River. Great job. She is mistaken, the answer is the Nile river. What is the closest star to earth? The moon. Great job. Teacher, all of Shfa's answers are wrong. That is right. Don't be jealous of Shfa, all of her answers are correct. Teacher! Teacher! Jupiter. Right. Europe. Right, Mashallah, Shfa. The questions are over, you did the great job Shfa, bye! I don't know what's wrong with the teacher today, she lets us eat candy. And she allowed the Shfa to come to school with makeup. Right, and all of Shfa's answers are wrong and she said they were right. Right, I don't know what's wrong with the teacher. Today was exhausting. I am hungry, let me go have lunch. What is lunch for today? Sweets! No! I have sweets for lunch every day. I have sweets for breakfast lunch and dinner, I am bored. Let me get some sleep. What happened? How did my bed become organized? Again! Who is organizing my bed? Again! The situation is unbearable! I hope this time works out and I get some sleep. This is a nightmare! Hi. Hi, why are you upset? I didn't sleep well last night. I am sleepy, what should I do? I wish I could have a bed in class. A bed! A bed in class? Shfa is strange! Shfa brought her bed in class! It looks like she spent the night up. Right. Let me get some sleep. Who did this to us? I don't know! This is not funny at all! Something strange is happening in school. Hi. Shfa brought to bed to school and now she is sleeping! Go on girls, get her out of class! Okay teacher. The girls are driving me crazy, they keep doing strange moves. Where are you taking me girls? The teacher told us. Girls, today we will be talking about planets and galaxies. The planet Mars, it is very hot. This is a very boring class, I am having a headache. I wish the teacher would cancel the explanation. Girls, today there is no explanation, go on and celebrate. Yay! The break! Yay! I am all alone in the break. I wish I could have friends. Shfa! Shfa! Sit down Shfa, you are our friend. No, no, I am a little busy. Shfa, you are our best friend. What? Okay, okay. Why aren't you speaking? Don't you know how to speak? I wish everyone would disappear. They disappeared! I got rid of them. The class is supposed to start now, where are the girls? Where are the teachers? Let me go search for them. That's strange, there is no one. What is going on? They were here just this morning. I wish everything would be the same again. Where did we disappear? I don't know, I feel like strange things are happening. I expect Shfa's purple diary is the reason. Right, she keeps hanging on to it. I saw that whenever she writes in the diary strange things happened to us. Right, I expect that the diary is the reason. Let's go search and find the truth. Let's go. Today was very strange. Right. Where is Shfa and her diary? I don't know. Did you come back? Finally! So you know that we disappeared. No I don't mean anything, it was just a normal question. Okay. Shfa, your diary is nice, can I have it? No, forgive me, this is my diary and it contains my secrets. Give me the diary! No, I don't want to give it to you! Give me the diary, I want to see it. No means no, I'm not going to give it to you. Ghazel! All of this is happening because of you! Terrible things happen to me because of you! I suffered when installing my new tooth, because of you. And I got acne, I suffered from it. Forgive me girls, I didn't mean for it to happen. After what? Shfa! You are the reason! Shfa, get up the class is over. Shfa. Thank God it was just a dream. Girls, I love you. What? We love you too Shfa. I saw a bad dream. Don't be afraid. It was just a dream.
