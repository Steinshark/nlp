Situation 4.5.1. Received. Text: Azovstal. Civilians Right now at the Azovstal plant, there are hundreds of civilian citizens hiding from the &quot;Russian world&quot; in basements and bomb shelters. Alongside Ukrainian soldiers continuing to defend the city, they have found the only possible refuge. Hello! Hello, guys. We've brought you some gifts. Good day. Good day. Good day. Hello. A bit of food for the kids. Kids, come here, we've brought some tasty treats. Come on in. We've gathered some. Hello, how are you? Don't you think this guy looks like a godfather? A little. He does, but it's not him. Hello. Hi! How are you? How are things, girls? All cool, all good. What about you, did you make new baskets? What have you been up to? I made a basket. Really? I saw you were weaving here last time, right? Here it is. Great. Is it for decorations? Yes. How beautiful. Congratulations. We're here to... I saw you came. I'd like to say something. We really want to go back home. We want to go back alive, we want to see our parents, our relatives... And so on. We miss our friends a lot. Yeah? Well, you've all made friends here already. Soon you'll get out and continue being friends. Will you? Yes! Great. I have so many games. Wow! Great. What day is it for you here? I'm here since March fifth. It'll be two months. Two months... We've been here since March second... Don't know when we'll get home... Russian occupiers and collaborators from the &quot;L/DNR&quot;, consciously aware that civilians are here, drop aerial anti-bunker bombs, shoot with missiles and all available artillery means. So I call on politicians from all civilized world: Organize a &quot;green corridor&quot; immediately to conduct the evacuation of civilians, wounded, and the bodies of fallen soldiers who are to be buried with honors. Caption: &quot;Children Don't See the Sun.&quot; Life in the Underground We've made a lot of food here. Here's all sorts of milk. French fries, Lipton, ice cream... Even ice cream in the shape of a pencil is here. We've also written a list of food here. We want to make... Food to order. Yes. Mhm. For example, my brother wants French fries. He orders it. We bring it to him, and he gives us paper money. So we can feel important, not like I give her a paper toy, and she gives me something real. We make money out of paper. And we color them, paint them. We try to entertain ourselves. If you can hear me, please, you can come here to &quot;Azovstal&quot; and take everyone from the bunkers, all the children, all the elderly, everyone from here? Even animals, even you, kitty. Because we want to see the sun already and so on. Because we sit here all day, doing... Well, not nonsense, sometimes nonsense, sometimes not. In short, it's boring to be here, in the darkness, far from the world. We want to know how our families are, how our houses, streets, and the city itself are doing. So we want to get out of here faster. You understand, two months and my child can't even bathe. The things we came with, I have to cut them here because he's physically outgrown everything. We have nothing for the children to wear. Children draw food because they're hungry. They don't go outside. My child doesn't know what the sun is, doesn't even know what green grass is. I implore you to do everything possible to get us out of here. Yes, he agrees with me. We try to be peaceful. When there's shooting, everything shakes here. Caption: Silence mode From today, your evacuation begins. Today, 50 people will leave in two or three groups. Are you the first group to leave? Yes. Yes? What are your impressions? Tell us. I want to go and see my children, my grandchildren. And where are your children? Children are at war. Really? Two. Somewhere around here or...? Somewhere around here. They were in Kurakhove. And why are you crying? What's wrong? You're leaving, everything will be fine, what's wrong? Calm down. Don't cry. What's wrong? Come on, gather yourselves, no need for extra thoughts. Don't cry. The journey will be long. It will take who knows how long. From six to eight hours, maybe even more. That's how it is. They'll be taking you roughly towards Zaporizhzhia. Others who remain here will be visited by a second convoy. But, I'll tell you right away, it will be a day or two. One will go there, then return. There will be several of them. Not just you. They're evacuating all over the plant. Any questions? None. Yes, when you hear the child's name, parents say &quot;here.&quot; Do we need to go there? Everyone down! Everyone down! Don't rush, slowly. Our morning in the bunker started with us beginning the evacuation. We prepared, gathered all our things. My child and I even went upstairs already. But unfortunately, the promised ceasefire was broken and the soldier who was supposed to handle our evacuation was injured. Is that an ATGM? Yes. This? They brought them. This is the vehicle that was hit by an ATGM just now. Not just now. Not just now, but an hour and a half ago. Yes, escort. Once again, the Russians violated the ceasefire and did not allow the evacuation of civilians. who continue to hide from shelling in the factory basements. I urge the international community to evacuate civilians. Respond appropriately to the critical situation where the enemy disregards any ethical norms, conventions, and laws, destroying people in plain sight of the whole world, acting with impunity and lawlessness. Glory to Ukraine. Caption: Evacuation. First rescued. Good day again. Sorry for this delay. I understood that they're filming their movie there... Some priests are hanging around there for some reason. No-no, they'll leave now. They were putting a bus here. I see. Before we start our conversation, please turn your phone and switch off the camera and microphone. What's this? If possible, could you flip the phone... Yes, yes. Hello. Hello. Are you getting ready? Let's go, get ready. Only 20 people. That includes children, am I right? Yes, of course. With children... Let women and children go first then. Yes. Hurry up. There's not much time. The UN and the Red Cross have arrived. Can I go tomorrow with my husband, so I can be with him? Two children, one small. Yes, you can. Look, the priority now is children. Children and... But what if we stay here until tomorrow? Stay. No one will drive you out. But understand that it's better to leave if you have the opportunity. Where are you going? Supposedly Zaporizhzhia. Are you going? With a small child. Are you going? Great. Here they go, I... Can I take... What-what? Take it. If you can't carry the child... Give him to me here. Young man, help me carry this out. Help the grandma please! Where is he? Give me all of this. Hold the diapers. Okay, I'll hold them. I'll hold them. Don't cry, buddy... What's wrong? Hello. We won't leave without him, simply. Don't worry. We've taken care of it now. The UN has come, the Red Cross has come. He's crying because his father isn't coming with us. Well, he'll come, don't worry. Right now, it's important for you that the children leave, right? Is this a guarantee of safety? Well, the UN has come here, the UN has come. And personally... And who are you? Azov? We're Azov. Thank you very much. Alive and well. Yes, yes. Boys, thank you. And how about yours, boys? They're fine too, walking already. Well, thank God. Did you change the bandages? Yes. The wound is bleeding a little, but it's also closing up. It's a big one, won't heal quickly. Thank you. Everything's fine, don't worry. I've got you. Let's get up. And they've arrived. Is this your bag? Yes, thank you. Good day. Good day! Don't be afraid. Today, for the first time in two months, I'm with my family and with our friends, children from other families, who were in the bomb shelter at the &quot;Azovstal&quot; plant. For the first time, we're out in the fresh air, in open space. Today is our evacuation. I hope, I really want this, that everything will happen peacefully and we'll safely reach Ukrainian territory. Specifically in Zaporizhzhia, where we hope to continue our lives. Where's my bag? Here, here. Here's your bag. I don't know... Give me your bag. Take my hand. Oh, my dear... My dear... It's okay, grandma, just a little longer. We've been here for two months. Two months, right? Yes. So now the UN and the Red Cross have arrived. We're confident everything will be fine. Everything will be fine for you. We really hope so, it's truly salvation for us. What's the baby's name? Sviatoslav. Sviatoslav, a wonderful name. Okay, Sviatik, I give you a fist bump. Give me a fist bump. Alright, everything will be fine. Sviatik turned six months old yesterday. Yesterday? Yes, yesterday. 20 people... Look... Let's do it like this. I'm the eldest. 20 people with me, civilians. What we managed to gather. We have one transport, you see its condition. Plus flat tires. Will we deal with it tomorrow? I'll try my best. All of us... There are still people, many people. Someone left on their own today. We'll be here tomorrow morning. What time approximately? And what time will you be ready? Do you have contact with our leadership, so that we know... The only thing is it shouldn't be like last time. We're just about to start evacuating, and two granates... We have a wounded soldier, the driver. We'll stay here for sure. Are we starting the evacuation? Yes, we're working on it. Alright, plus. How many people? Four each. Four each, right? Okay, first four people! Let's go! Careful. Let's go. Take my hand. Careful. The soldiers stay in the vehicle. Grandma, may you reach safely. Good luck, good luck. Good luck. He came out on his own, independently. It's on TV already. Him? Yes. Oh my God... He crawled through a hole, so... He's like that... Careful. Alright, good luck to you. Thank you. And good luck and health to all of you. Is that all? All. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Note: Negotiations. Evacuation of more than 100 people. Do I understand correctly that today we'll be receiving around 100 people? Yes, almost 100. According to my estimates, it will be 72. Yesterday we handed over 21. We still have a few hundred at the plant who can only come out under the guarantee that people will reach Zaporizhzhia. They don't really want to go to Russian territory. It's a matter of principle for them. So they're afraid and don't trust. Information received. I understand. So we'll bring out the last group of people today. Tomorrow morning we'll coordinate with the Red Cross. They'll be in Zaporizhzhia. We can't process it all today. There's a UN and Red Cross safety protocol. They won't travel at night. In the evening or tomorrow morning, when they depart, you'll receive confirmation of their arrival in Zaporizhzhia, and then we'll prepare for the next action. Yes, noted, plus. Wait. We have about 30 civilians, who are in a bunker under the rubble. We're slowly extracting them. They have food and water. We have voice contact with them. We're trying to dig them out. Acknowledged. Yes, I acknowledged. That's all. But you should also understand that tomorrow the convoy will leave, and the next action, of course, according to my opinion and experience working with the UN, will be within 2-3 days. It's just the paperwork associated with organizing a new action. I acknowledged you. I gave people choice. They've decided to stay. So by force, I don't have the right to evacuate them from here. They need guarantees that people will get to Zaporizhzhia. Acknowledged. That's absolutely correct because people should have their own choice, especially about where they're going. So just once again, say that it'll take 2-3 days to prepare a new operation similar to evacuating civilians. Yes, plus. They understand that. I even told them it might take about 5 days. Acknowledged. Plus, all acknowledged. Passing the station to your fighter and proceeding. Inform about the last batch beforehand. Yes, plus. That's it. What about this? We won't wear it. He won't wear it. I won't wear it. We'll help. About 200 meters, around there... What about you? How are you doing? Just fine, shorter. Ready for the journey? Yes. Thank you. Be careful. What are your impressions? Tell me. Scary. Why scary? I don't know. I just want to go home. I don't know what to say. Where do you want to go now? I want to go home, to my child. But your kid is here. Because he's at home alone. He's not alone. He's not alone but... I'm here, and he's there. He's 10 years old. Well, 10 years old is already okay, you don't have to worry too much. Do you know what I hope for? That they might also be able to join this convoy. Because the convoy is huge. But they are in the village. I don't think they'll pick up from the village for the convoy. In any case, the ice is broken, as they say. And you know, there's hope that everything will be fine. I hope everything will be fine for you too. Tell me about your impressions. We hope to get to Ukraine somehow. Preferably... Preferably to Ukraine, yes, that's where we want to go. We need to get to Ukraine. To relatives, to everyone. All our relatives are in Ukraine, so that's where we're heading. The question is: why didn't you leave earlier? There was no evacuation. There were two evacuations, and both times they were canceled. Goodbye. Best wishes to you. Received. 21 with children. Congratulations. We didn't even know you had set off. We were just sent off. What time did you arrive? About 10 minutes ago. Sorry for the delay. No problem. Damn, ATO. The delegation has arrived, we are starting the transfer of the first batch. The second group will bring medicine, and they will bring... And you will bring the &quot;200th&quot;, &quot;300th&quot;. Understood. When we bring more civilians, we can exchange then. Will you take the body and the wounded today? Yes, we will take the body at the same time as we exchange the medicine. We'll take the body and the prisoner. How many? We were told 1+1 or more, just like that. That's what they said, 1+1, &quot;200th&quot;, &quot;300th&quot;. At the same time. Exchange. I think they mentioned the Russians. About prisoners. There are not only Russians there, there's &quot;DNR&quot;. So... Good afternoon. Good. How are you? Fine. So, it's not just one, there are more there. Let's do this. I have 21 here now. Then you'll arrive. Then I realized we'll have to deal with prisoners. I'll coordinate with the ration. It'll be fine. We'll figure it out. I think I'll bring the medicine on the second trip for civilians. That'll be in about 30-40 minutes with these roads... I'm sorry. A crater on a crater. That's it. And then... And about the wounded, ours, is there any discussion? About what exactly? Well, evacuation? We don't have any plans yet... The question is, what are we going to do: they have 21, we'll take them, they'll come back and bring the second batch. That'll take about 30-40 minutes. And now a fighter asked: &quot;What are we going to do with our wounded?&quot; With your wounded? That's not a question for today. We're just bringing medicine. We're taking one dead body and one Russian prisoner. That's been agreed upon. Today, we're discussing what we're doing according to what's allowed for us. Of course, we're taking civilians, bringing medicine, taking 1+1, the &quot;200th,&quot; the &quot;300th.&quot; That's how it is... Alright, we'll agree now. If there are any questions when we arrive? Alright then. We'll unload now. It'll be another 30-40 minutes to pick them up. It's definitely 40 minutes because it's a long process. In that case, we'll bring out 21 passengers now, they'll leave. That'll take about 30-40 minutes, and they'll come back... What will you come back with?... We'll come back with the next batch of civilians now. The priority now is civilians. The priority is to bring civilians. 21 now and the next ones will arrive in half an hour. Not a dead body or a prisoner? So the next batch won't have a wounded or dead? No. Only civilians. Only civilians. How many civilians will there be today? It's important for us to know, because it's difficult to organize everything. Please tell us. We need to pick up and transport, pick up and transport. We need to be present for all these moments of the process. How many civilians are we expecting today? Right now... Later... I can't say. Many are still refusing because they're afraid of not ending up in Zaporizhia... Most of them refuse to go because they're afraid. that they won't end up in Zaporizhzhia. So we have this moment now, there are about... I don't know. There are 30 people in the bunker. However many I convince now, we'll try to get them out. Right now they'll be here, they're already at the checkpoint. In groups of 2, or 1. They'll be here now, then we'll pick up the next ones. Plus, got it, just discussed that. Alright, quietly please. Did they say anything about the next batch? Good luck, can I hug you? Thank you. I wish you luck. I believe you'll find your son. Just don't cry. Keep yourself together and control the situation. Be happy. Thank you. Thank you, I believe everything will be fine. You can even talk on the way, ask questions. Thank you very much. Good luck to all of you. Good luck to you too. Nice to meet you. You've done well to endure this. You're great for enduring this. 12, 13, 14... Alright, good luck to you all! Everyone, good luck! Have a safe journey. Stay in touch. Yes, stay in touch. Goodbye. Turn around. We're waiting right now... Yes, but turn around for now. Note: From mid-March to May 2022, Azov Regiment evacuated around 1200 civilians from under Russian shelling. Around 300 people were officially evacuated with the participation of international organizations. The Russian side disrupted the evacuations several times. All negotiations and the transfer of civilians took place on neutral or enemy-occupied territory. During attempts to evacuate civilians from &quot;Azovstal,&quot; due to violations of the ceasefire and shelling by Russian forces, 4 defenders of Mariupol were killed and 12 were injured. Moments of evacuation were filmed on bodycams of Azov fighters.
