"100 grams, 10 yuan" "10 yuan" "It looks very spicy; I don't dare to dip in this sauce!" "If it's not spicy enough, you can add more chili." Very good potatoes. "The best sauce for cold dishes" "No additives at all" Hello, friends, I'm Dawen. I hope you have a great day. Today, I've come to a market in the southern part of Chongqing city, China. It's mid-July now, and today's highest temperature here is 39degC (102.2degF). What's the temperature where you are today? Feel free to comment and tell me. This market has a market day every three days. Vendors only come here to set up stalls on market days. This couple sells homemade dried noodles. Vendor: "We have egg noodles and plain noodles." This stall sells roasted goose meat. Roasted goose in Chongqing is roasted very dry, unlike the juicy roasted goose in Guangdong. Roasted goose here is paired with a spicy and numbing sauce. Chongqing people really love spicy food. But not all Chongqing people can handle very spicy food. Child customer: "This sauce looks very spicy; I don't dare to dip it." "I've already paid." This sound is the hallmark of traditional handmade maltose. This stall sells tofu and savory tofu pudding. Savory tofu pudding is one of the most common breakfast items in Sichuan and Chongqing. It's usually served with sauces or seasonings. Tofu is found all over China. But savory tofu pudding isn't available everywhere. The difference between savory tofu pudding and tofu is that the former takes less time to make. Tofu is made by adding a coagulant to soy milk and then pressing it into shape. Savory tofu pudding is made by adding a coagulant to soy milk and letting it coagulate directly. So savory tofu pudding is softer and more tender, while tofu is firmer. Hand-pounded chili powder is an essential household seasoning in Sichuan, China. Vendor: How much do you want? Customer: I want 50 grams. Vendor: 5 yuan. This stall sells various steamed breakfast items. This is a steamed cake made of corn flour. Vendor: "How many corn cakes do you want?" Customer: "Four." Corn cakes are sold by weight, 10 yuan per jin (9 yuan per pound). This market has four types of pears. This is Xinjiang fragrant pear, which has the most fragrant smell and a sweet taste. This pear, which looks like an apple, is called an "apple pear." It is a fruit cultivated by grafting apple and pear trees. Grafting technology allows the combination of tissues from two different plants. This is a snow pear, which has a mild flavor and firm texture. This is called "sugar pear." But its taste does not match its name; it is bitter and sour. People usually soak it in licorice water to reduce its bitterness. This is "green crisp plum," produced in Sichuan province, China. This plum looks unripe but is actually very sweet. The sweet and crisp green crisp plum is very popular. China's mango production is very high in summer. These are mangoes from Sichuan province, China, which are big and fresh. The highest mango production in China is in Guangdong and Hainan provinces. But I personally think mangoes from Sichuan are better tasting than those from Guangdong and Hainan. Mangoes are very cheap, selling for only 2.7 yuan per pound. Corn puree vendors are common in markets in Chongqing. Customer: Just put it in boiling water to cook it into a paste, and it's ready to eat. There are two kinds of corn puree, one for boiling and one for frying. "Delicious corn puree." This stall makes fried chicken and fried duck. People in Chongqing love fried meat dishes more than those in other parts of China. Markets in Chengdu, China, only have fried pork. But here, in addition to fried pork, there's fried chicken, fried duck, fried goose, and fried fish. These are chicken pieces being fried in this pot. The fried chicken is poured into a sauce made with onions, peppers, and seasonings. The fried chicken smells delicious, with a rich onion and meat aroma. Customer: I think it's not spicy enough. Vendor: If you think it's not spicy enough, you can add chili powder. Vendor: "Free sample." "This is fried duck meat, free sample." It's 9:00 in the morning, and the temperature is already 34degC (93.2degF). The scorching heat doesn't dampen people's enthusiasm for visiting traditional markets. The current price of beef in China is generally above 30 yuan per pound. Due to China's natural environmental conditions, large-scale cattle and sheep farming is not feasible. Cattle and sheep in China are raised on a small scale, so the output is low, and the price is relatively high. This bag of beef costs 39 yuan. Me: What cut of meat is this? Vendor: This is brisket, and this is chuck. This bag of beef costs 110 yuan. This stall sells braised goose. Braised goose is made by simmering the whole goose in a broth containing various spices. Braised goose has a delicious flavor with a rich and unique spice aroma. The meat is tender and elastic, not rough or tough. Braised goose in Chongqing is not only delicious but also very cheap, selling for only 15 yuan per pound. In Guangdong province, raw goose meat alone costs 22 yuan per pound. Is goose meat a common dish in your country? Feel free to comment and tell me. The vendor is busy chopping goose meat, indicating how delicious the braised goose must be. It's summer vacation, and children are out shopping with adults. Blueberries from Yunnan province are the most expensive fruit in this market. Blueberries are priced at 22.5 yuan per pound. Potatoes are 1.3 yuan per jin (1.1 pounds). This bag of potatoes costs 8.4 yuan. During summer vacation, some vendors bring their children to the market. In traditional markets in southwest China, you can see pancakes made from stone-ground corn puree. These corn pancakes have no seasoning, and their taste is mild, focusing on natural health. This vendor also makes yam pancakes. He is making yam pancakes right now. Yam is a root vegetable with a delicate texture and slightly sweet taste. It can be used as a main dish or medicine to aid digestion. Century eggs are a traditional food loved by all Chinese people. They are made by preserving duck eggs with lime, ash, salt, and rice husks for several months. When ready, the egg white turns amber-colored. The yolk becomes very sticky and has a unique earthy flavor. Century eggs are usually served with a sour and spicy sauce as a cold dish. This stall sells various herbal teas. Chongqing is one of the "Four Furnaces" cities in China, known for its intense summer heat. So every market in Chongqing has stalls selling herbal teas. People drink herbal teas to reduce the feeling of heat. Herbal teas are priced at 5.4 yuan per pound. Vendor: That tea is 10 yuan for 150 grams. Me: What tea is in that pot? Vendor: Oolong tea. This stall sells braised beef. This is a type of cooked meat that has been simmered for a long time, with a rich flavor and firm texture. Seasoned dried tofu is a popular daily dish in southwest China. This is seasoned dried tofu, usually spicy or five-spice flavored. It can be served as a dish or as a snack. It's 9:45 in the morning, and the temperature has reached 36degC (96.8degF). For those planning to visit Chongqing, I recommend coming in the autumn or spring. The traditional markets in autumn, winter, and spring have a better atmosphere than in summer. This is a stall making pork buns. This large sign says "Naturally Fermented Dough Steamed Buns." This is pork filling. The vendor said they use naturally fermented dough. Natural fermentation creates more air pockets in the dough, making the buns softer. Buns made with naturally fermented dough have a unique slightly sour taste. This is because lactic acid is produced during the long natural fermentation process. The vendor is now making buns with braised pork filling. Buns steamed with naturally fermented dough look fluffier. This handmade traditional maltose was a popular snack in southern China in the 1980s. Now, this snack is only found in Sichuan and Chongqing. Vendor: Cutting 100 grams is enough for you. The last time I ate this maltose was when I was four years old. Vendor: This maltose is 100 grams, 10 yuan. It still has that classic mild malt and caramel aroma. But now, its price is much higher than in the past. This is Sichuan pepper. This chef is cooking spicy pork intestines. In Chongqing, almost every open market has stalls selling stir-fried dishes. When this chef stir-fries, flames occasionally burst from the pot. The flames shoot up impressively. You see this scene, and customers are drawn in. The high-heat stir-frying method creates a visually stunning effect. It instantly livens up the market atmosphere. Vendor: "Next one." You might wonder why people in Chongqing, known as the "furnace," still love such a high-heat cooking method. This is part of Chongqing's unique food culture and lifestyle. Chongqing people love spicy food because the heat can stimulate appetite. And it can also help with sweating in the hot summer, bringing a cooling effect. Vendor: "Next one." High-heat stir-frying can quickly lock in the flavor of the ingredients, making them more delicious and juicy. It also gives the dishes a unique charred aroma that is mouth-watering. Watching the flames rise and hearing the sound of the spatula hitting the pot, this lively cooking method makes you feel the strong vibe of everyday life. This market also has an area selling ornamental fish. These fish look very special; they have four legs and six tentacles on their heads. They look a bit like the dragons in Chinese legends, very cute. Do you know what these fish are? Feel free to comment and tell me. At 11:30 am, most people have finished their shopping. The next morning, I came to Changsheng Bridge Subway Station in downtown Chongqing. Vendors set up their stalls right at the subway entrance. Before even exiting the subway, I heard the hallmark sound of handmade maltose. This maltose looks very fresh. Office workers hurriedly rush to catch the subway to work. There are several convenient breakfast stalls at the subway entrance. Using molds to make breakfast is highly efficient, catering to the fast pace of office workers and students. This vendor makes rice cakes with three fillings: red bean, soybean flour, and raisins. Making pastries with molds is very simple and doesn't require complicated techniques. These breakfasts are very simple, convenient, and cheap, a good choice for office workers. This vendor makes oven-baked buns. Some of the buns are filled with white sugar to satisfy those who like sweet flavors. The buns give off a rich toasted aroma. Freshly baked buns are puffy but become flat after two minutes. This vendor makes "pork and egg mini burgers." Vendor: "We have spicy, tomato, and original flavors. Which one do you want?" Making breakfast with molds is a simple and easy task that anyone can handle effortlessly. Vendor: "We have spicy, tomato, and original flavors. Which one do you want?" Customer: "Tomato flavor." Vendor: "We have spicy, tomato, and original flavors. Which one do you want?" Customer: "Tomato flavor." The mini burgers are brushed with chili sauce inside and out. Then sprinkled with chili powder. This vendor's pork and egg mini burgers are very popular. Young people hurry to catch the subway to work, while older people slowly come here to buy groceries. "The remaining ones are 3.5 yuan per jin." This is a stall making fresh spicy sauce. Vendor: "20 yuan per bottle, 1 kg (2.2 pounds) per bottle." These are the ingredients for making the spicy sauce. "20 yuan per bottle, available in mild, medium, and extra spicy." "This is the best sauce for cold dishes." "I'll make you a medium spicy one." "This is the best sauce for stir-fries, barbecues, cold dishes, and savory tofu pudding." "No preservatives, artificial colors, or additives." Ingredients: dried chilies, peanuts, peas, green Sichuan pepper, red Sichuan pepper, melon seeds, sesame, chili oil, etc. Sichuan pepper, crushed peanuts, sesame. "This chili sauce can be used to cook noodles and stir-fry meat." 20 yuan. Dear friends, thank you for exploring the market in Chongqing with me. Here, I discovered a variety of delicious foods. In every bite, I feel the Chongqing people's love and dedication to life. Thank you for your company, and I look forward to our next culinary journey!
