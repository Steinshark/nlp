Nusibeh: This woman should not be here, she should leave this house. Fatemeh: Where should I go when I have my own house? Amir: Didn't Fatima bring you inside last night? Naseeba: Yes, I brought it inside the house . Amir: Then why did you fight again? Nasibeh: I don't want this woman to be next to you and me, I can't stay in front of this woman for one minute. Fatima: Let's go inside the house with her. Naseeba: Go take your children and bring them here. Fatemeh: My children are young, they can't bear it, they get sick. Naseeba: I can't bear it either, I'll get sick. Fatemeh: Well, what should we do? I'll tell you to come inside the house. You're arguing here too, when you say it's hard for you, go to your parents.

Naseeba: You should stay and live here, go get your things and live here. Naseeba: Go take your children and live in a tent. Fatemeh: I can't do something like this with my children, but how many times I tell you to come inside the house . Naseeba: You have to leave here or take your children and go inside the tent. Fatemeh: What are you doing? Amir: Let go, go sit in your tent, don't fight so much. Amir: Don't fight from morning to night, stop, he will tell you to come inside the house and live, why are you fighting? Naseeba: That woman must go.

Naseeba: I don't want her and her children to stay inside the tent and live with me as an illusion. Amir: How can two children live here? Don't make yourself look oppressed, you are not human. Amir: Did the dog go out again? Fatima: Yes. Amir: Look what he did with this room, he came into the house with muddy feet. Naseeba: I force you to provide me with everything and build a house. Amir: Come on, go inside the house and live. Naseeba: I will not stay with that woman. Amir: Why do you make yourself so oppressed in order to find sympathy? Naseeba: Shut up, you ruined my life. Amir: You have no morals, no understanding, no intelligence. Didn't we say come inside the house? Why did you fight? Naseeba: Am I telling you not to stay in front of my eyes? Fatima: I'm going to work, don't talk. Nasibeh: I will make the tent, but that woman has to live inside it, I will not stay here. Amir: We don't like it under this rain either. You stay here. Come and go inside. How many times will I tell you? Naseeba: That woman should go because she is to blame for ruining my life. Naseeba: You have to make a house for me, a kitchen, a bathroom, a washroom, whatever you made for this woman, you have to make it for me too. Amir: I don't want you and I don't have the money to build a house , these are also for you Fatima, not mine. I don't want to live with you.
