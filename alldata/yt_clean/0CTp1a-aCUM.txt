- [Mr Beast] I built two massive cubes so these 100 kids can compete Whichever cube has the after 100 hours, splits 100 kids are going head to - We've just been closed in. Doors are closed. We're by ourselves. - Are you gonna lose to a bunch of adults? - [all kids] No! - You're not gonna let a bunch - [All Adults] No! - You do have to split the 500 grand. - I'm a giver, so I - [Mr Beast] That's right. Only the remaining players splits the half a million dollars. - We just hit an hour! - So far I have been retaining my sanity. - [Mr Beast] Attention, you're and I'll give you a thousand And this is the only time unless you win. You have 60 seconds to - A thousand dollars is not enough money. - I'm going to leave - People are leaving! Hey, is that your son? Wait it's like father, like son. - This is not good. - You are the last one out. Let's see the damage. [Mr Beast] In just one hour, we've eliminated 12 adults and 10 kids. - How y'all gonna leave, and - A lot of people just left. I don't how to feel about that. - [Mr Beast] And now that there's something we need to take care of. - They gotta sign this. - We have to sign this paper that says, our kids can spend the money responsibly and we won't use it on ourselves. - [Mr Beast] As long as the kids win. - I can't believe they're - [Mr Beast] And Chris - I got a toilet! - Alright, you're good. How many YouTubers does it - [Chris] Poop time! - Bathroom! - They just drilled a hole, 'cause it smells really bad in here. - It smells horrible. - [Chris] Is there somebody in there? - [All] Yeah! Why didn't you tell me? I'm sorry! Enjoy your poop. - I don't know how you do this, - That's the fart pipe. - I hope that was sand that fell off. - {Nolan] We're five So I left everyone alone until morning to see what they do. - So the boredom's kinda kicked in. We've been looking at these tiles and kinda realized that - So, now we're gonna do that. All of them. - Who's going to school tomorrow? - Take this. Stand right there. - Hey Nolan! - [Nolan] Yeah! - - Stop! Why do you guys always do this? - These things are so much fun. - I've got an idea. - Yeah? - [Mr Beast] And the next morning, one of the kids tried to see - [Tareq] Hey! - [Nolan] He's trying to cheat! Are you trying to tell them? I'm gonna have to escort - What was the number? - It was locked. - No! - [Nolan] And because of him, So let's see if we can - We brought you all oatmeal! - It's not good! - Who made this? - [Tareq] I don't know, it was not me. - You did a terrible job and I want your cooking license revoked. - What just happened? You just walk out? - Wait, whoa! [Mr Beast] The oatmeal always works. - Now that any of you just left, who do you think's winning? - Them. - Yeah. - The oatmeal is deadly here, it's so bad. - Oh no! - [Mr Beast] Since - It didn't have no sugar. - [ Mr Beast] I had an idea. If two of you get out, I'll - [All] No! - [Mr Beast] Now I'm gonna make but I think they might - I want a cup of coffee so bad. - Coffee. - Caffeine! - Here's the situation. If you want coffee, two and I'll go get 75 cups of coffee. You'll do it? - When's this gonna air on the YouTube? - The YouTube? - [Mr Beast] Nolan promised 75 coffees. Let's go see how Starbucks reacts. Can I have 75 coffees? - [Starbucks Employee] 75 what? - [Mr Beast] Even though the a few of them still decided to leave. - What? - Somebody's about to step - [Kids] No! - I'm gone. - More money for us as soon as they leave. - We brought the coffee! - Thank you so much the coffee, man. - Everybody seems so happy - [Mr Beast] Now we're really Karl, Nolan open the doors. In front of each cube is a giant button. At some point in the next 24 hours, this button's gonna turn green. And whichever side presses shrinks the other team's zone. And Karl, whenever you feel like it, change the color to green. It's up to you. - Do you see this? Your foot's an inch away from the line. - You guys have strategy? - We have three people - Three? - We all just had coffee, so we're up. - We are jacked! - I'm gonna change the color to blue, and see if we can catch anybody. - That was horrible, Karl! - I got out. - [Karl] You got out? Alright, you came together. Come on, let's do this. - - There's only 50 of you left. How many do you think are in the adults? - I think like 60. - Let's switch the Then turn it green. - I was definitely here before him though. - They just barely beat you, I'm sorry. - Still a letdown for my team. I'm sorry! - Look, they love you. - [Nolan] It's the end of day two, and already the kids - Hey everybody! I have a new proposition. I think we can all agree oatmeal sucks. If you allow me to shrink your square, I'll give you each a pizza for dinner. - Oatmeal, all the way, until we go home. - You have one minute to decide. I'll be back. - [All] Pizza, pizza! - [All] Oatmeal. oatmeal! - This is all I've wanted all day. - I'm sorry, Jimmy's making me do it! - [All] Oatmeal. oatmeal! - All right, y'all enjoy. - If I don't make it, this is why. - As promised, I bring pizza! Here you go. I got one for each of you. - We got a whole pizza! - I'm gonna cry. - Would you say this was - [Nolan] Not much happened - It was way harder than - It's getting smaller and smaller. There's like no room in there. - There's 60 adults left. How many kids do you think are left? - If they're getting the same oatmeal we're getting every single day, 15 maybe. - Oh, I think we're losing by a lot. - [Mr Beast] By day four, to get really, really, really bored. - Whoa! - [Mr Beast] So we've decided - This is not a drill. Hey, do you guys wanna pipe - [All] Yeah! - Alright, bet. - I'm so excited! - Hi! - Mama's still here! - Jessica? - She's not here! - Really? - - Yo! - Hello! - That's my girl! - I miss y'all so much! - Hey, stay strong, stay I love you, Buddy. - Sorry guys! - [Mr Beast] The boys wanted to see if they could get some people out. - This is an empty briefcase and we're gonna bring it in there and try to get people out with it.

Hmm. - They could have had 10 in all the other videos it was empty. - I don't ever trust what - Surely the adults are too smart to fall for something like this. - There's no way. Attention! - [Moms] What? - [Mom] No way! - It was just a briefcase. - You know Jimmy said he was only giving away the Nothing beyond that. - Mm-hm. - We're gonna do it again, but this time it's really gonna rock. - Why did another person leave? - Let's see if we can go four for four. Whoever walks out here - Now this time with just $1 sticking out. - Attention! - Bruh, why? - Was it the dollar? - No, I didn't even see the dollar. - He also got out for the same thing. But he is a kid. - You're really just terrible. - Me, who can blame me? - I'm just gonna show and if they walk out, so be it. - Try to like make a - I don't think they want it. - Surely the adults - The adults will be smarter. - It's gonna be embarrassing. - [Adult inside] What's in there? - I will point out the kids - Oh, I can believe that. - Jimmy hasn't been in since yesterday.
