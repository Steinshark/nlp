I am really excited to bring my friend Bill Wiese. you so much for having me. It's a pleasure to you at Hungry Generation where you came with and your story. I've heard of your story from as well and I was really moved by your not only Jesus and your devotion to being a minister that Your eating habits, just your very spiritually impacted me as a young minister and impressed me and to really take care of my body, my mind and to say thank you for that. Oh thank you so much. beginning. How did you come to know the Lord? your personal, what was your encounter with Jesus personal Lord and Savior? Well a friend actually event where I got attacked by a shark and I can saved me from death from the shark, grabbed my leg God. I didn't know Him then as I was a raised as so I was 17 years old then and then a friend needed to repent, ask forgiveness for my sins and of 1970. So I've been a Christian for 53 years That's for sure but that's where I first got saved that happened 28 years later. Okay so 20 years of and I was serving in our church. I taught here and topics and I led had worship and so forth so I was have studied the word. I love the word of God the topic of hell to find out if everything I saw So your life before this experience, what were ever have visions before? No first of all, I was a for 50 years with my own company and my wife also were in a professional careers at this time, I was it caused us to leave our careers and then travel that now full-time for 17 years and part-time for initial that experience. Take us through that where when the Lord gave you that vision. Right. every Sunday night, nothing unusual about the went to bed like any other normal night and I'd glass of water and suddenly, I was pulled out of something grabbed me and pulled me out of my body. tumbling down this long tunnel and it was getting stone floor in a prison cell in hell. Rough-hewn but like a dungeon but Isaiah 24:22 mentions that. verses talk about the prison cells in hell and was fully awake and cognizant. I was just like I'm am I here? And it wasn't explained until the way heat. It was like a blast furnace and I wondered so my reaction was I wanted to get up and run out I had no physical strength whatsoever. It took with my body. But Isaiah 14:9 and 10 says, Hell they will say, Art thou become weak as we? and go down into the pit: I am as a man that has no Well it's a thousand times worse than that. Any says, In Him, we live and move and have our being. Well I looked up, I saw these two demons in the over the one's body, a huge jaw, sunken in eyes, two were about 12 or 13 feet tall. That's not an I'll keep moving and they were pacing in the most ferocious demeanor about them and they were comes from the demonic realm Revelation 13:6 James hatred they had for God, they directed towards me. demon picked me up and threw me into the wall, have. You have none. I collapsed. I felt as if spirit doesn't have bones but it sure felt that Lord explained that He blocked most of the pain. small amount so I could relate to people, it's not real literal pain you're going to feel in hell. dug his claws in my chest, tore the flesh open. I should be dead but I noticed I had a body. destroy both soul and body in hell. Luke 16, his tongue. He had a mouth to speak, a tongue and these torments but something else I noticed wounds. It was just all dry but Leviticus 17:11 there's no life in hell so there's no blood. out of the pit where there is no water. There's have no mercy over you whatsoever. They have an the mercy of the Lord is upon those that fear don't derive the benefit of mercy. About this God's presence there to illuminate it so I could and it returned to its normal state, absolute He hath set me in dark places, as they that of darkness forever but it wasn't just dark, you an exaggeration. Exodus 10:21 mentions a darkness just seems to penetrate through every cell in your I was placed over next, this large raging pit of understood that like a huge hole in the ground and again, it wasn't metaphorical or allegorical importantly it's what the scripture says. Psalms fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest. them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep many verses I could give you on the fire but I see through the flames and I saw the outlines, screaming at the top of their lungs, burning woman that the screams were so loud but Isaiah the wicked. There's no peace of any kind My people dwell in a quiet resting place. You're of quiet but you know most of us have never seen that and the screams and so forth and demons were to even fight them off at all and so that's I saw knew that I would never get to her again. I could to Sheol shall come up no more. I understood that that is to have no finality with your family. you still exist. See death does not mean you cease you still exist. I understood I was down deep in when I left but more importantly, there's 49 is. I'll just give you two. Ezekiel 26:20 Numbers were different levels of torment and degrees of you shall receive the greater damnation. Hebrews it shall be for you, you who have tried underfoot point is there is no comfortable, tolerable than your mind can conceive. Wow. You have no away. Ecclesiastes 9:10 says, There's no work and this another thing that's so horrible in hell the foul spirits Mark 9:25 They have a disgusting it, it smell like burning flesh and also burning they have signs posted where you cannot go past a the volcano, it's called sulfur dioxide and if sulfur is just another word for brimstone and the So you're breathing in this foul putrid disgusting not enough air to breathe. You have to fight for 42:5 says the Lord gives breath to the people upon deep beneath the earth. God's very specific If you need to sleep in hell, you never get to shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the holy angels and the smoke of their torment rest day nor night. Now that primarily means no because Isaiah 57:20 said the wicked are like the always moving, it can't rest but again rest is gives His beloved sleep. Well, you're not His tunnel that was ascending upward and there were Some were only 2 and 3 feet tall some 12 and 13 were snakes and I was standing on a bed of maggots under thee and the worm will cover thee. Look it I never knew this but when a dead animal is being maggots die. Well that's why Jesus said where because the flesh is never fully consumed in hell. on thee. I mean that's disgusting enough. You're of hunger, thirst. Remember the rich man Luke get. So the thirst is unimaginable that you're just watching people burning and demons attacking description I can really give. So you were first, you went through this place where it's a lake of coming down into the center of the earth and then quoted the scriptures where the Bible talks about you think that this was the future lake of fire where currently people are at. I did not see the is in right now, okay and that's after Revelation word 'Hades' which is the current hell. Death and judged and then they're cast into the lake of hell which is Sheol is the Hebrew word or Hades is and they'll be delivered up and then cast into even in this Hades, you saw fire as well the on the fire. Jesus talked about hell in 46 verses hell. So yeah there's a lot of verses on fire. And were they mainly suffering the punishment there or Matthew Henry's commentary and some others point Matthew 8:29 When Jesus went to cast out a devil, us before the time? So it indicated our time 20:10 at the great white throne judgment when they are down in the current hell and they are in According to most of the commentaries. So they can there's no angel to protect you. So it's kind of they're not actually in that final punishment that teaser pretty much of what's really coming shared also the sense of hopelessness. Were you kind of in the vision or the Lord let you feel the blocked it from my mind that I was a Christian. I blocked It from my mind. You say, Where's that in disciples on the road to Emmaus, it says their John MacArthur's commentary and Matthew Henry's Him. God hid it from them. Well God hid it from my as a Christian which I was but I didn't know, I of here. I would have known that but He wanted me Isaiah 38:18 says, Those who go down to the pit I am the way the truth and the life. They have is actually the worst part of hell because your of time as a beginning and an end but in hell, I this place and He wanted me to experience that me more of an urgency to witness to people and where they're going to go and they won't get person dies, it's too late. They will not get Calvary coming over the hill to rescue. There's no just alone and isolated forever in this place and you kind of came back or you had an encounter with happened? Yes as I was looking at all this horror, I was ascending up these cavern walls around me bright light appeared. Now Vlad I knew immediately who He is but I didn't see His face. I just saw holy light and it didn't hurt my eyes but I looked words. He said, I am and when He said, I am. I I can only explain it through Revelation 1:16 was bright as a sun and I fell at His feet as one too and it hit me so strongly when I was at His I would be in that place for all eternity. Man, I died a horrible death on the cross to keep me out I just want to thank Him and praise His holy saying thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Oh I love you Lord. Thank you for loving me and mind and He would answer my thoughts. I didn't my thoughts. Wow. Psalms 139:2 says He answers why did you send me to this horrible place? He real. Wow. He said even some of My own people here. Wow. Now Vlad at the time I thought wait a we have found out sense many Christians believe teaching that says you simply cease to exist if that says everybody get saved, at least eventually false teachings and He wanted me to point people them to the scriptures. They don't have to to convince anyone to believe my experience. Just the other thing that the Lord told you of why He because many people He wanted me to go and share not even sharing about hell because they cannot torment for all eternity. So they just don't not realizing there are answers why hell exists or vindictive to anyone. So I can explain that a a little bit later. Anything else that the Lord did those demons hate me so much. He said because 15:18 Jesus said they hated Me before they hated but they can hurt His creation. Wow. That's why steal and destroy but He said, I have come that So all the destruction, the evil, wickedness and realm as you know. I thought Lord I don't want gonna think I'm crazy or had a bad dream. He said the Holy Spirit's. He said, you just go and tell to admit, I didn't want to share this experience to everybody but I didn't want to share this nature and they're going to think I'm crazy but I to a Bible study. I went reluctantly to share it. later and after I shared at this one Bible study, started getting invited all over the country. this vision into, how long did this take place 23 feel? Did your wife find you? Did you come back to this? Well I got up at 3 o'clock in the morning. I my body, I was outside my body, the Lord put me into my mind and I started screaming and I went fetal position on our living room floor screaming she did was look at our digital clock and it said from but she found me on the floor and didn't it was and I screamed out, pray for me, pray for and God removed the horror but left the memory. So somehow he took away the horror in my mind but I felt that my body was dying. Seeing hell is cannot take that kind of you know we hear people horrible things. Well I definitely and I was in removed the horror. So that's what happened then to anybody until about... No, I told one friend went reluctantly three months later. Wow. So this a book, start a ministry. You're living your life and get some water and the Lord takes you there now the Lord gives you a assignment that He wants as the scripture says but it's almost like He with Gideon. When He told Gideon you know, I am them to listen to the enemy as well to almost your wife you know she sees this experience that the horror away but you have a very vivid memory then reluctantly 3 months later, you share this on spreading like wildfire and so many people start noticed every single thing that Bill shares is he's not basing. He's very conservative man like He's basing this on the scriptures but experience when it's talking about the issue of why would question that a lot of people are scared of night before Christmas. So our Christmas service, beautiful Mary, Jesus and Bethlehem story prepared sleep the whole night and the Lord started started who are not going to live to see another Christmas specifically that I need to preach about hell on Christmas. I mean I'm like maybe on like some so and I wrestled. I wrestled and yeah, I preached probably, I ruined Christmas for a lot of people for them but not ruin their eternity by preaching every holiday and preach a brimstone fire message hell than we should. Jesus taught more on hell that and we don't hear that. I mean when was the and so can you speak a little bit about into that, on the topic of eternal damnation and eternal Matthew 25:46 These shall go in everlasting life used the word, everlasting is the word aionios. everlasting and also Matthew 25:41 Jesus said prepared for the devil and his angels. So He message of love because it's a message of warning child not to play in a busy street. Well that's it's in a way like, Hey I don't want you to go you can choose not to go there. So that's why we know there really is a hell because if you don't any urgency to even get saved, number one and of an urgency to walk in the fear of the Lord. You understand the severity of hell 2 Corinthians 5:10 the Lord, we persuade men. So he's saying, when you will be more persuasive with men and that's what we're safe from. To walk in the fear of the tells us to do and number three, gives us more many will pray a nice little sweet prayer maybe. about our business but when you understand how it was that bad. You'll get on your knees you'll or a vision. Send laborers across their path to them. Don't let them go. I ask you Father, don't fast maybe and pray more diligently and that's about how severe hell is. Bill, why does God being hell? Well, He doesn't send anybody to hell you have their part in the Lake of Fire. So there's the only way as Jesus said in John 14:6 I am the the Father but by Me. If you don't believe that, condemn you because you said, I don't believe the a way to heaven but because He loves, He cannot you stay out but if you say, I don't believe it but He warned you if you don't, you will end I mean you know people have that free choice. So them to hell and you know God's arms are open to world. So that it's not narrow-minded in that can come to the Lord even if they've been wicked please forgive me of my sin, I'm sorry and He's breath and then take them to heaven. So that's people go to hell. Well remember it's the same keep you out. So how much more loving can you get as you mentioned and Jesus has already provided this message is a conviction to some people to salvation. Tomorrow is not promised to anyone. Did people who were believers? No you know, what God from a woman. Okay. They just look like skeletons. from what I could see through the flames. You can the edges. It's so dark, it consumed all that a man from a woman and I had no idea if there were that to me but the one thing I did know was there one, I could see the outlines of the people and I could hear their screams and you could tell the but more importantly it's what the scripture come unto me, for such is the kingdom of heaven you'll not enter. So I believe the scripture is don't know what age the accountability is but He revealed to me. Some people say that hell rich man and the Lazarus which is one of the very gave is just pretty much a symbol and it's not a reasons, it's a true story. Number one, a parable a name. This has three names, Abraham, Moses and and verse 29 in Luke 16 Jesus said, And Abraham as saying to the rich man. So if it was a parable wouldn't have said that if it was a parable. He also said a certain rich man. So it's a true parable which it's not clear, clearly not but what parallel real life and so to speak and here, He wanted a drop of water to cool his tongue. He to come there. He knew they needed to repent in great gulf fixed or a gorge in the earth. He could So he had his sight to be able to see so for so, there's flames and there's fire in hell and he was anyway... It's not an an analogy. It's not was describing of somebody who went there. Now eternal. This can't last forever. This has to fire should run out. God maybe will do it for a end and it's just, this kind of torment is not... cannot be eternal. What would you say to a person first of all, the word eternal is used about hell in the Old Testament and number two, when Jesus into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and the same place as the devil and most people accept Well, He just told you you're going to the same in Revelation 20:10 it says that Satan was cast forever and ever. So there He said eternal is the clear but also you see people think that can't God if you said you spent 500 years in hell and said and Ephesians 28:9 says, we're saved by grace not our time is not valuable enough to pay for sins. there is no remission of sins. So our time is not that kind of value to pay for our eternally was sinless to pay for our eternally deserved sin. It's the same word us when Jesus said these should everlasting punishment. So we don't want heaven a time you know. It's the same word aionios. bit about... That's why it's so horrible. Could you mentioned about soul sleep, universalism yeah annihilationism. Could you kind of speak a have embraced from the world and they are not I mean you got Luke 16 which we talked about So he still existed. Isaiah 14:9 and10 says, Hell They will say art thou become weak as we. So The strong among the mighty who were upon the they're speaking out of hell and then that whole countries that are gone down to hell and bear and so you know and then Revelation 14:10 through hell deliver up the dead that are in them. So those people are in hell and they're delivered up where the Beast and the false prophet are thrown of the Lake of Fire. They're thrown in at the the end of the tribulation they're thrown in and there, burning a thousand years later. Wow. So you pretty much which says that every human being His children to hell and pretty much, we're all There are quite few even Christians embrace Those who obey not the cross the enemies of is destruction so that means that they don't they're let out of hell or whatever. Jesus said I'm getting ready to go to heaven and you're going you cannot come. So He just told you cannot come. the Pharisees. I'm getting ready to go and you'll go you cannot come. So he just told them, they're everybody makes it. Well, there's two right there it said it would have been better for him and like I said those people in Sheol that are Revelation 20:10 says, whosoever was not found of Fire. So you know that's where they're going to shall not depart out of darkness, not depart out They shall never see light. Well that presupposes still exist. Isaiah 38:18 those who go down to no hope that means you still exist. There's no 33:12 says the people shall be as the burnings of into the fire and burned. Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings. Everlasting. So they're 14:10 and 11 says and the smoke of their torment day nor night. They still exist to have no rest. holy angels and the presence of the Lamb. Wow. You know a lot of people Bill, they think, when they'll have rock and roll, sex, fun, hang out and all of the stuff, not realizing that hell is kingdom. He doesn't rule hell. He doesn't reign God is in charge of that and He is sending people demons they deceive people through sin and to of sins that Jesus gives us and they end up going meant to be a place for people. God designed well because God is holy. God's standards are right. He designed it for, it says in Matthew angels but He used the word prepared which means too where he goes to prepare a place for us in hell for the devil but what He did was you see it so James 11:7 says, Every good and perfect gift So all the good we enjoy in life, the fresh air, All the good comes from God. It's not automatic. His goodness from hell in preparation. So hell's only death in hell because John 1:4 said God John 4:16 said God is love. There's no mercy in Lord's in the heavens. There's no strength in hell us strength. There's no water in hell because heaven and there's no peace in hell because Isaiah if God removes Himself from the situation, all without God. You can't separate the two. So if a a place prepared that has nothing to do with hell does represent God's wrath. All through the sin in the form of fire. That's the fires of hell so we wouldn't have to take that wrath. So you can Wow. That is such a beautiful gospel presentation. God will grant you that wish. God honors your not want anything to do with Christ, with God, God because you know when we are on this earth and these gifts, they come from God. The light that people think that they can take all these gifts His omnipresence on this earth. He pretty much is will create a place where none of that will exist it's that place of isolation and you know who so many people are headed there. What do you say believe in purgatory, who believe that there is a place and somebody here on the earth can make and then God will pretty much kind of take you the finality and the pretty much when you die, when you are in hell. Well like I said before. shall go into everlasting life and the shall go eternal destinations and it says the same thing Matthew 13:30 13:49 and many other places point the good fish from the bad fish. It's always place that you're going to be let out of. Besides born again spirit and new heart, new nature that's hell or purgatory, well you're not going to get wrong premise. Time could never pay for sins. 1 Peter 1:18 says. So it's the blood that redeems believe in purgatory and you know God cannot take take us to heaven the way we are Revelation 21:27 or corrupts. So see His nature is different than explain this for a minute. You know Hebrews 12:29 in Nahum 1:5 says all of us would be consumed we'd be consumed in His presence because He's so Well, He has to give us a new nature. You know to retrieve something and the fire burned me. I of that fire. I wouldn't say that. Why because fire are not compatible. Well neither is sinful new nature and the only way He gives us that is He considers our trust as if we were righteous on H,im our sins and He takes our sins, washes our Lord and Savior. Then He considers our trust Titus 3:5 says not by works of righteousness He saved us so we're trusting in what He did on were righteous, gives us a new heart and a new let us into heaven because he gave us a new heart then He dealt with our sins and washed them away. with. That is such a beautiful illustration that sinful nature and God's holiness they're not of good works, trying harder, being better humans, forgiveness that Jesus offers today, forgiveness I will forever remember the illustration that you about people in Titanic. How there were three and then there was only two types of people. Could don't know the Lord into that relationship with set sail, there were all different religions, were three classes of people on that ship. The ship went down at the White Star-line office in the people would wait anxiously each day as a man on one of the signs. Now one sign said, 'known to Now when the ship left, there were all different classes of people but in the end, there are only your choice because God loves us, He gives us that our actions. You know there's a consequence for saved. There needs to be a purposeful act on last verse, Revelation 20:15 says whosoever cast into the Lake of Fire. God has a book and His book and the worst words you could ever hear prepared for the devil and his angels. He would that free will to choose and you chose to push to repent of your sin, ask forgiveness that just I can't save myself. I'm a sinner and I don't sin and I agree, I want to follow Jesus. That's Jesus said in Luke 13:3 unless a man repent verse Romans 10:9 and 10 says, if we confess with that God's raised Him from the dead, we shall heart and confess Him with your own mouth. If you repeat this prayer after me. This is going to come Say dear God in heaven. I know that I'm a sinner Son Jesus to die on a cross for me that He was and lives forever more. I ask you to forgive me of Come into my heart. I receive you as my Lord and for saving me. Thank you for taking me to heaven going to heaven and I'll serve you all the days of they said that go tell somebody what you've done I'll confess you before My Father in heaven. So done. Amen and if you prayed that prayer today the podcast later down the road or listening in a and Spanish and many more languages down the road, with Bill. I gave my life to Christ and go tell Bill, if somebody wants to learn a little bit more in hell or any other resources, how can they do Soul choice ministries.org or 23 minutes in teachings, books.
