Semiconductors have recently become the most chip has sparked technological wars from one the China-US trade war. One of the countries that Philippines. The country is indeed surprisingly entire semiconductor supply chain. Yet, most They continuously see the Philippines still a old. The Philippines' role in the semiconductor (ATP). Although ATP is a lower-value work, in countries like Taiwan and South Korea, it is After semiconductors are designed and where they are assembled into their final for delivery. These processes are critical for in a wide array of products, and the Philippines A large portion of this ATP work is done in such as those in Laguna, Cavite, and Batangas. Instruments, Amkor Technology, and Onsemi have attracted by the country's cost-effective In fact, Texas Instruments' facility in sites outside the U.S. This site portion of Texas Instruments' global the Philippines has become an integral But how did this all begin? How did the entire semiconductor supply chain? Well, The origins of the semiconductor industry in the the country was exploring various avenues for the rise of export processing zones (EPZs) in foreign investment and boost export-driven growth. the Bataan Export Processing Zone (BEPZ) in Multinational corporations, particularly began to take notice. These companies sought components at lower costs while maintaining workforce. As a result, companies like Intel and during the 1970s, marking the beginning of Texas Instruments (T1) was a key player in the began in the Philippines in 1979 in Baguio City. of confidence in the Philippines' potential availability of an English-speaking TI's Baguio facility quickly became one of the United States. It focused on the including products used in automotive, industrial, and capabilities made it a critical part enabling the Philippines to secure a reputation as Intel, too, was one of the most important and testing facility in Cavite in 1974. Like Texas competitive labor costs, strategic geographic Intel's Cavite facility became a key part of significant portion of its microprocessors Intel's presence in the Philippines country's reputation as a reliable partner for invested heavily in infrastructure and worker manufacturing capabilities. The company's impact on the region, creating thousands of However, in the mid-2000s, as global manufacturing Philippine facility in 2009 as part of a broader the experience and skills that Intel imparted the semiconductor industry. Many work for other semiconductor spreading the expertise they had By the 1980s, these two companies semiconductor industry. As electronics global demand for semiconductors surged. by positioning itself as a reliable hub for This has then brought in new foreign investors (previously Fairchild Semiconductor) established of low labor costs, tax incentives, and Amkor Technology, leading provider opened up doors in the Philippines in Muntinlupa City and later expanding to other advancing the local semiconductor supply technologies and processes. These innovations such as ball grid array (BGA) packaging, which ON Semiconductors, on the other expanded its operations in the Philippines Motorola in 1999. This acquisition included Cavite. Over the years, onsemi has invested making it a key part of its global supply Philippines focus on products used in automotive, Although the growth of the Philippine industry there were also local players. One notable Inc. (IMI), a subsidiary of Ayala IMI has grown to become one electronics manufacturing services (EMS) and IMI specializes in producing automotive and power semiconductor devices, and it has in various countries. As a homegrown building local expertise in semiconductor to multinational clients. The company's ability reliable partner for semiconductor firms seeking Now during this period, the semiconductor sector and semiconductors became critical export exchange earnings and creating thousands of jobs. specialized in were labor-intensive but required attractive location for these operations. The Cavite, and Cebu helped further solidify the Unfortunately, by the 1990s, the semiconductor The global semiconductor market was becoming Malaysia, and Thailand also making significant increased regional competition pushed the workforce skills, and overall ease of The government responded by creating the which streamlined the processes for setting more attractive investment environment. PEZA's semiconductor players and attracting new ones, Despite these efforts, the Philippine focused on the assembly, testing, and packaging struggled to break into more advanced areas which were dominated by countries with (R&amp;D) ecosystems like Taiwan and South Korea. status as a crucial player in the ATP segment Today, the semiconductor industry is massive. Industries in the Philippines Foundation, accounted for approximately 62 percent of with semiconductor products alone representing of dollars in export revenue each year. It including engineers, technicians, Even the US, which has long been a key partner in industry, recognized the Philippines semiconductor value chain. But anyway, do let
