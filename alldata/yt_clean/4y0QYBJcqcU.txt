In association with [This film is based on Real history.] [33rd Year of Jiajing Period, Ming Dynasty.] Wujue, which one of them is gonna win this time? Wuzheng I guess. For he has this explosive power The purpose of kungfu is to restrain oneself, not on others. Wuzheng does possess great strength. Wuyuan, on the other hand, has learned to quell the greater force by skills. Let's make a bet. You buy me a roast chicken if you lose. Can you stop thinking about food? Check out your pot belly! Nothing of you makes a combat monk. You've got to look under the hood, where great power deposits. Power. Is this your power? Forget about roast chicken! Roast chicken! Forget about it! Watch out! Do honor your bet! Awesome. Wuzheng is simply out of this world. Shaolin Temple has long been the protector of the kingdom. Now the Japanese Pirates are rampantly plundering the civilians. Shaolin kungfu ought to be the backbone in combating the Japanese Pirates. The emperor has decreed that combat monks of Shaolin should leave for Feiyu Fortress in eastern Zhejiang, to teach the frontline soldiers Shaolin staff, deter the Japanese Pirates' advances, and protect our land. Volunteers, please step out of the line. Wuzheng is willing to go. Wuneng is willing to go. Wuhai is willing to go. Wujue is willing to go. Wuzhou is willing to go. Wuyuan is willing to go. The court has awarded 18 horses and 18 cassocks. The court asked for those exemplary of the best kungfu and conduct. The first 18 of you to pass the test will be representing Shaolin in combating the Japanese Pirates. Amitabha. Wujue, how long have you been with the monastery? More than 2 decades. You excel at both Buddhism and kungfu. It's an arduous journey ahead, I am counting on you to take care of them. Understood. The mundane world outside is in stark contrast with the monastery. Don't lose yourself. Stick to our rules and be sympathetic with the sufferings of the ordinary people. Rest assured, Abbot, we will be heading back after the teaching. Rein back on greed. The Japanese Pirates killed my fellow compatriots. I must drive them out and come back to the master as quickly as we can to continue studying Buddhism. Every deed has its consequences. When the moment of enlightenment comes, whether you harbor hatred or compassion, it's going to determine the destination of your pilgrimage. Understood. Wuyuan, You are born a compassionate man with a big heart. What you're gonna see outside are all just illusions. But your choices are reflections of your heart. Without your guidance how am I going to make the choices? It all stems from your heart. I understand. In the 31st year of Jiajing Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, the Japanese Pirates landed at Hangzhou Bay of China and advanced north bound, sweeping across Zhejiang, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, with little resistance. Along the way they committed heinous atrocities and brought great suffering to the civilians. The court declared a war on the invaders. Shaolin monks heeded the call and sent out combat monks to the font line. You are animal! Kill them all. Dad! One should fight back when squeezed by snakes. The buddha preaches good as well as retribution. Interesting. Marvelous! What is this? Seems like the monk's certificate issued by the Ming court. Major General Konishi, General Konishi is set to capture Feiyu Fortress in 3 days. He asks to join forces with you. It's the business between me and my brother. Keep your nose out of it. Asshole. Wujue, I am going to fetch water. Okay. Everyone, unload the luggage. We are having a break. Okay. Here the map you asked for. Good. How far are we from it? It's right past this woodland. Feiyu Fortress is right ahead. Is it possible to buy roast chicken at Feiyu Fortress? Yes or no? Wujue! Wujue! Shi Xiong What's the problem, Wuyuan? Look over there! Amitabha. Wujue! Let's go! Take the staff Wuyuan! Rescue the people! Wuyuan! Rescue the civilians. Bald men again. Interesting. No killing, Wuzheng. Asshole! Wuzheng! Amitabha. Tiezhu! Here you go. Yours. Thank you. Sir. Excuse me. Yes? I am starving. Here you go. Keep these for down the road. Thank you. Master, have you guys seen a boy? About this height with a braid. No. Thanks for rescuing us. Where are you from, Lady? We are from the He Village. The Japanese Pirates raided yesterday. And I got separated from my younger brother. Where are you going then? There's no place for us. The Japanese Pirates are everywhere. Our soldiers have either been killed or fled. The autumn harvest is around the corner. I see. Let us escort you back. Thank you! Please rise up, Sir. Rest assured, Sir. Wujin, lead the horse over. Thank you for saving my life. My son! How did it happen! Stone! Stone! Stone! Stone! They are the Japanese Pirates. You let him go, he is gonna come back to finish you off. Stone! Stone! My love! My love! My love! What am I gonna do without you! My love! Where are you heading to? What about you? The court has decreed that we should make to Feiyu Fortress. The fortress is guarded by the Ming garrison. Many refugees are said to have fled to the villages to the back of it. Can we come with you for the west? Make way! Watch out everyone. Search in pairs. Wujue, why did they seal the arsenal? If they are dead set on fleeing, what's the use of weapons for? Let's go Wuyuan. Master, is this the Feiyu Fortress? Why is nobody here? It seems that the garrison have learnt that Konishi is coming and took flight. General, who is this Konishi? He is the most savage honcho of the Japanese Pirates around the coastal area. He is full of ambition, nicknamed Cao Cao. It was him that defeated us. The samurai you killed today could very likely be his twin brother. What do we do then? We don't have a choice. We must press on. What if Konishi catches up from behind? Monk, why don't you escort them and run away? Wujue, our mandate is to teach the army kungfu. Now the students are all gone. Shall we teachers just maybe... General, these are women, children and the elderly. They are never gonna run away from the Japanese Pirates. If we don't stay and guard this place, they may not be able to retreat safely. Exactly. We shall stay and wait for that Konishi. We can't allow them to get past the fortress. Bro, They are gonna guard the fortress! You are merely a handful of monks. Look at your build, and your battered staffs. That's how you gonna fight their blunderbuss? You barely have enough food. Don't bite off more than you can chew. What did you just say? You wanna fight a duel? What do you think you are doing? Knock it off! General, The 18 of us have the same conviction. Hope you could understand. Good. Good luck to you. Move your ass, what're you waiting? We wanna stay with the monks. Stay then. Let's go! Alright. We should avoid marching at night. Let's take a rest. Wuzhou, set up the cauldron. Stay still! Slower! How lucky. Polluted senses. Go fetch water! Go. Sir. Master. We are not in possession of nice stuff, but this is a little token from us in expressing our gratitude. Please take it. Please take it. Sir, I can't take it. We've been counting on your protection all along. Just take it. I thank you for that. But I really can't take it. But... Take it! So be it. Miyamoto, capture Feiyu Fortress. Yes, Sir. Shiranui, follow me to slaughter the rest of the temples. Let's go. Go on. Boss, It looks like we can stay away from the monks, but not the temples. Don't you not want food! Go beg for alms. Begging alms from a monastery? Shut your pie hole! Okay! Excuse me! We are here for alms. Konishi. Let's go. Boss! Wuliang! Go get more rice! Our food won't last long. Here you go. Come on! Wuzhou, evacuate the civilians. Run! Here you are. Ronin Squad, charge! Kill them off! Listen up, everyone, just drive them back. We can't have mercy for our enemies! Wuzheng! Wujue! Staff formation! Pull back! Retreat! Ouch! Could you be light-handed a bit? Wujue. I do not come back to guard the fortress. I just don't wanna watch you die in vain. General, the court must have not known that it's left unguarded. As a general, You have the authority to call for reinforcement to beef up defense here at the fortress. You better part with your illusion about reinforcement. General, I don't understand it. Feiyu Fortress is a key stronghold. We can't afford to lose it to the Japanese Pirates. Are you finished? I am sleeping! If all of the Ming soldiers are like you, who is gonna protect the civilians? General, no matter at what cost we must... Enough! What makes you think you can come down on me like that! I, Cao Xiaotian, survived countless battles. You want additional troops? Sure, come over! Here are your reinforcements! At Shidunshan battle, a handful of hundreds of Japanese Pirates took out our entire forces. Forget about reinforcements. I've been gathering up the badges of deceased soldiers, putting their names into the journal. So maybe one day, if I can get back alive, I could fill their families in on it. Amitabha. I appreciate your being honest with me. I shall stop bothering you. You got lucky this time round with Miyamoto. You won't have the luck next time. Your chanting isn't gonna dispel the Japanese Pirates. You are being too tolerant to win the battle. To stand by watching lives in danger is killing. To save a life in exchange of another is also killing. We don't have a choice. Monk, this is not your responsibility. Do yourself a favor. We are combat monks from Shaolin, half monks, half soldiers. Wujue, over here! I am on my way! What's the problem? Wujue, This man claims to be from He Village. He got away from the Japanese Pirates. They are nearby? Not far to the southeast. Wujue, please take us away with you. With your protection, we would feel secure. Wuming, Wuqing, and Wuyuan, stay vigilant tonight. Watch for any raids by the Japanese Pirates. Okay. No panic, Sir, as long as we are here, your safety is guaranteed. Thank you. Uncle He! Uncle He! Did you see Stone? The Japanese Pirates seized dozens of villagers including my wife and Stone, they were both captured. Is Stone... ...alright? He's fine. Master! Please! Please rescue my Stone! Master. Please! please get them out, will you? Wujue! Wuzheng and a couple of others have rid off! Uncle He. You! You are ronins doesn't mean that you can just slob around. We've got some fun over there. Go check it out. This time around, what do you want to bet on? Boy or girl. Boy or girl? There is response in it. It said daddy! For boy, there! Girl over there! Place your bet! Boy or girl? For all these days since we landed on Ming's land, you guys are still empty-handed. What a dud! Total dud! To make up for you losers, kill her! Kill her! Come on! Kill her! Move it! Stone? Stone? Don't be scared. I am here to get you out. Stone? Stone? Sir. Back off. Hurry up! Hurry! Move! Move! Fire! Wujue! Wujin! Wujin! Hold him back! What are you doing? Let go! Let's go! Let them go! Put out the fire! They got back. Mother! Wujue! Stone! Stone! Stone! Are you alright? Ever since you left Shaolin, you've been hell on wheels spoiling for a fight. Now because of your rash moves, Wujin and Wuxing were killed. You are too deeply entrenched in the doctrine. I can't just stand by and watch them killed. Had we not made it on time, you would have all been dead by now. I do not fear death, at least I've got notched on my belt countless lives of Japanese Pirates. What about Wujin and Wuxing? We started off with 18 of us. Now how many! Knock it off. Hurry up! Boil more water! Come on! I am gonna account for it. My love! That must be the village at the back of the fortress. Since the Japanese Pirates came, the refugees who lost their homes in eastern Zhejiang have all fled there. Xiaoman and Wuyuan should be on going soon. Knowing you don't stand a chance, yet still throw yourselves into it. Tenacious. General, you should pull out of it now as well. Now that you are ready to die for it, will you leave your name behind? I am just an ordinary combat monk, not to be remembered. General, should you visit Shaolin one day, bid my master adieu for me. A samurai doesn't fear death but not humiliation. I want you to make amends. I want all the monks beheaded and their heads hang on our flag pole. Wish them rest in peace in Heaven and there is no more pain. When they just came to Shaolin, they were always running around us, and were the lightning rod when we made mischief. Their blood is on my hands. Wuzheng, is it really so hard to resolve the hatred? When I was a boy, I had a 5-year-old sister and my mother was pregnant, when the Japanese Pirates broke into my home killed my father and abducted my mother and sister. I went out after them and was beaten down. When I came around... I came to Shaolin and have been working hard to revenge today. Our master rescued you from it, yet you never let it go. Love and hate are both emotional obstacles to our sadhana. For all the blood on my hand, I am ready to confess all of my sins in this life before the buddha, to clear my karmic debts. I am far behind you in studying Buddhism. I am flattered. I know that I have been rather stuffy, but it kind of sunk in lately that killing is to protect, and karma rather than the human being is to be wiped out. Whether or not to cut off the karma depends on if you have a strong will. Off we go! Let's pack up and go. Okay. I'll take this. Mind your step, mother. Bean, when you get back home, what would be the thing top of your mind? When I get back... Boss, I am gonna go on a drinking spree. Booze is all you care about, huh? Come over! Tell you what, number one thing on your list should be marrying a woman and make a baby. What's that for? Boss, I am just fine going along with you. Bean, extend your hand. Go! Boss! You have a life to live. It's essentially suicide to remain with the monks here, Boss! Boss! Every one of you is a master of kungfu, one-on-one is not gonna be a problem, but on battlefield, a different story is told. Siddhartha Gautama carved out his own flesh to feed an eagle. We ought to follow in his footsteps. But they are not eagles. They are a pack of ravenous wolves. Your blood is gonna feed their ambitions. Knowing it's a dead end, why do you return, General? I've been falling back all along, further away from home. It stops here today. Wujue! At the gateway. No! No! Please! As I said, they aren't human beings. They are a bunch of demons. Why did they do that to the corpses? That's the way they use to declare the war. The evils owed too much karmic debts. Acts of kindness are never gonna work on demons, then let's redeem them and discharge their souls. It's a doomed battle, but it doesn't mean we are going in without a tactic. Let's check out any resources that can be used. This one must be fixated well. What's the setup here? We erect a ladder over there. The enemies have come. How many? 130 more or less. Hold your horses. Probe! The monks have taken flight. It's empty. Probe again. Fowling piece. Fowling piece. Retreat! Move! Hurry up! Full-out attack. Attack! Let's go. Wuhai! Hang in! Captain Cao! Indiscriminate shooting. For all the blood on my hand, I am ready to confess all of my sins in this life before the buddha, to clear my karmic debts. Let's make a bet. You buy me a roast chicken if you lose. Go! Charge! Master! Master! I am sorry Master! They... Sorry! Master! Master! Sorry! Wujue is willing to go. Listen up, everyone, just drive them back. Now that you are ready to die for it will you leave your name behind? I am just an ordinary combat monk, not to be remembered. Acts of kindness are never gonna work on demons. I've been gathering up the badges of deceased soldiers, putting their names into the journal. So maybe one day, if I can get back alive, I could fill their families in on it. Let's make a bet. You buy me a roast chicken if you lose. Check out your pot belly! Polluted senses. Go fetch water! Love and hate are both emotional obstacles to our sadhana. For all the blood on my hand, I am ready to confess all of my sins in this life before the buddha, to clear my karmic debts.
