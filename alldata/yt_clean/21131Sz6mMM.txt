[theme music] [David]<i> This is your</i> [David]<i> We're inside police <i> operations in Ontario,</i> <i>on the trail of stolen vehicles.</i> [Charlsie]<i> Easy targets, taken [Scott] It's a-- You know, how easy the cars [Charlsie]<i> Canadians forced <i> for car makers to do more <i> tougher to steal.</i> [officer on radio]<i> He made that [Charlsie]<i> I'm with <i> just outside Toronto.</i> -There's a-- [officer on radio]<i> He's just [Charlsie]<i> See that black <i> Detective Scott Cressman [Scott] They stole three Tundras [officer on radio]<i> The Tundra [Charlsie]<i> The thieves <i> to try and get it So they drop this, you think, to put that black [Scott] Yep. [David]<i> While Charlsie is out <i> I'm outside of Toronto <i> It has one of the highest <i> in the country,</i> <i> and Detective Sergeant <i> and his undercover team [Greg] And that's our vehicle The blue Toyota Highlander. [David]<i> Police believe the <i> operation selling stolen cars.</i> <i> A problem that's become Can we arrest our way No, I don't think we will I think everybody's got a part and I think it depends on come to the table, and push forward. I'll be honest with you, it's where everything's coming and it's just boiling over. [dramatic music] [David]<i> The 2020 Honda CRV</i> <i> is one of the most stolen <i> About 5,600 in one year alone.</i> <i> Sharon Brickman had one <i>until it got stolen this summer.</i> The car disappeared. Who do you think should be to fight this problem? Definitely the manufacturer has to take it upon themselves. [Charlsie]<i> Meanwhile, <i> thieves in a stolen Jeep are We're gonna let them complete we're gonna conduct surveillance to take a safe next step You know, definitely don't want to get injured or killed in this exact moment. [Charlsie]<i> Hotel parking lots <i> for the people He's taking a long enough time like, they're gonna be actively [Charlsie]<i> And that stolen Jeep [Scott] Okay, I have This is gonna be our car. [Charlsie]<i> It's alongside [Scott] I'm around [indistinct], Let's see if they're together. There's a grey Sequoia up here. [dramatic music] [Charlsie] Do you think Oh yeah, a hundred percent. It's got a broken rear window. [Charlsie] So we're following We are. And where do you think They're gonna take this that we know. [Charlsie] Oh, there it is, [Scott] And here's the Sequoia. What will happen, like, is they'll have taken and they will be shopping it all these different levels of people So they'll be reaching out &quot;This is what I got, this [Charlsie]<i> But the police <i> before the thieves [Scott] We're likely [David]<i> There is another way.</i> <i> A country where cars <i> And auto makers <i> We're in the United Kingdom,</i> <i> inside an insurance <i> where cars are actually <i> We have nothing <i> Steve Launchbury <i> for automotive security.</i> And you actually based on how secure they are. The scoring mechanism and that gives the manufacturer to attain, to try [David]<i> The more layers <i> the more points it gets,</i> <i> which can mean lower And that would probably Oh, absolutely, So the incentivization is to do well to make it for the users Can you show me the ways Yeah, absolutely. [David]<i> Their testing <i> like an intrusion sensor.</i> If the glass was broken, or anybody tried to reach the alarm will then [high-pitched alarm blares] All right, so, [David]<i> And they give <i> for having a tilt sensor,</i> <i> to guard against theft <i> We would expect the alarm [high-pitched alarm blares] [David] And it does. If your car is attacked then it should put up some A lot of what you're doing I mean, you test for security, Do you think what you do Yeah, absolutely, with the theft problem. [David]<i> So, what's the deal Time for a little <i> We're hitting up <i> Honda,</i> <i> Jeep,</i> <i> Land Rover,</i> <i> and Lexus.</i> <i> Taking a look at the security <i> of the most frequently [David]<i> And comparing them On the British version This is the same kind The 2024 model offers as well as intrusion sensors to And that comes standard. <i> Same goes for the Honda Civic,</i> <i> and the Range Rover,</i> <i> Lexus RX,</i> <i> Jeep Grand Cherokee,</i> <i> and Jeep Wrangler.</i> All of them offer tilt But here in Canada, those are not on Canadian models You won't find tilt on this Honda CRV. <i> Or the Honda Civic,</i> <i> Range Rover,</i> <i> Lexus RX,</i> <i> Jeep Grand Cherokee,</i> <i> or Jeep Wrangler.</i> Do you think it's acceptable for sale in different and one is better Is it fair? No. Because, I mean, obviously, you would expect the car to be You know, we have got but we are certainly making it [David]<i> And auto theft <i>in the UK than it is in Canada.</i> We are making it harder. There is no one element that stops this car There are-- on this vehicle [Charlsie]<i> So, why <i> different on Canadian cars?</i> <i> We asked the companies.</i> <i> They all say they <i> to stay ahead of criminals.</i> <i> Honda says they can't <i> as it may compromise security.</i> <i> The makers of Jeep say <i> all Canadian standards.</i> <i> The makers of Lexus say <i> to new theft methods.</i> <i>While the makers of Range Rover <i>have features which are proving <i> None would agree <i> Meantime, there's a big break <i> They recover a bunch <i>and when the shipping container <i> look what's there.</i> <i> The stolen Toyota Tundra we'd <i> now likely to be [dramatic music] [upbeat, fast-paced music] [Charlsie]<i> We've learned some <i> in Canada come with more <i> Just outside Toronto,</i> <i> some residents say extra <i> can't come soon enough.</i> <i> At Dahlia Bateman's house, <i> when her Range Rover <i> while she's inside [Dahlia] Got in, just opened it, and 30 seconds later, he [Charlsie]<i> In a matter <i> the thief is gone, It's quite upsetting. It-- it made me what can they do next? [Charlsie]<i> Dahlia says police <i> Was the eighth one It is a very big problem. And at the end of the day, It affects our insurance rates, premiums, and, um, We all get burnt. [Charlsie]<i> 20 minutes away,</i> <i> Someone wanted <i> she says they held her up And he's like, I'm like, &quot;No, you know what, And then he's like, And he removed a gun. And he's like, &quot;If you call the Now, that must How are you managing now? It was rough. For a long-- Especially driving All this over a car. [Charlsie]<i> Anuj Sethi says his <i> in the middle of the night.</i> The parking spot was empty. I went to my, uh, The keys were there. And it struck me, Because I've been hearing going around, and sure enough, The reason I moved is because it's S-A-F-E. We were scared that night you know, like, it-- what if they come back, [Charlsie]<i> For Anuj, <i> when he bought My biggest consideration it was, it should not be stolen cars list in Canada. So you actually bought this car Yeah, 100%. [David]<i> While Charlsie hears <i> I'm in Orlando at <i> where investigators <i>in the fight against auto theft This problem started They-- they are selling [David]<i> Bryan Gast echoes that.</i> <i> He leads investigations And yet people are still stolen in 20 seconds. What's it gonna take The vehicle still to steal in the first place. Make sure it's more fortified, it's more protected. [David]<i> Incredibly, <i> to make cars <i> Vehicle security expert, We've got it ready to be adopted by the government, to what it-- how to properly to make it safe and effective. What can we as consumers government, manufacturers, to get to that next step? Make your voice heard. You are the most powerful thing, You talk you talk to your local MPP, and say, &quot;Hey, You gotta speak up, [David]<i> While we wait for Canada <i> back in the UK, <i> to grade a new <i> starting later this year.</i> Personalization feature we're just proposing now. It's a significant as a-- an enhancement So, this one has a nice feature. Essentially, So, you need to enter Just like going [Steve] Yeah, absolutely, of authentication before We're just starting should at least allow to allow the user and determine whether or not [David]<i> And this personalized <i> could take other forms, too.</i> As well as a PIN you could have designated that you need to switch [David]<i> Some car makers offer <i> but Steve wants them <i> Until that happens,</i> <i> some drivers are turning <i> But that extra protection <i> with systems like <i> is installing in Toronto.</i> We are looking at a really one of the most Yes. You've actually got a way Yes, we do. All right, let's take a look. So, here's the keys. Foot on the brake, -Electric start. [David]<i> Even though I have <i> it won't start.</i> What that does the driver to create a password. But it's not It's not four or six digits Not numbers. -Buttons, yeah. So, we have a default -which we're gonna change later. So what you're gonna do four times. [David] One, two, three, four. Yeah, you're gonna wait [car beeps] And now when you put and start the vehicle, -[engine rumbles] Good to go. Until you don't do that, So, in this particular vehicle, we have the buttons the shifters, and, uh, the mirror buttons. [David]<i> On this system, <i> in any order, anywhere It's like an individual password that would be basically -Exactly. why isn't it just That's a good question. I wish I had the answer, don't want to implement it yet. I don't know but it needs to be there. [David]<i> So, we ask Jeep,</i> <i> Land Rover, Honda and Lexus</i> <i> if they're considering adding <i> in their vehicles, [dramatic music] [Charlsie]<i> <i> says the response is simple.</i> <i> Manufacturers need to step up.</i> Some manufacturers or do things better And I think that the comfort is that they should that no matter there's a certain level going forward, that's [Charlsie]<i> And he says What would you like It needs to be modernized. It needs to be updated and looking ahead Because the more that we can and planning ahead for tomorrow, Because we don't want like we have today Is the government So, the government They need to do more, Because really, where cars are being stolen, [dramatic music] [Charlsie]<i> If cars in Canada <i> what is the government <i> Time for us to ask We have held consultations to update the Canadian to help prevent cars from [Charlsie]<i> She's holding <i> about combating auto theft <i> so we share I'm Charlsie Agro And our team has learned that of security features of some of the most But those same security on the Canadian models. So why are we not putting on manufacturers in this country We speak to manufacturers and we are on top our regulatory regime as secure as possible [Charlsie]<i> And what about <i> security standards When are you going to update And what's taking so long? We know that amending but yes, we are on top of it. Those consultations Officials are going and will be suggesting to the regulations. Do you want to commit on when Canadians can expect So we're at-- and we will put something [Charlsie] Okay. And I am working on an [David]<i> Until then, police <i> including Peel's enforcement <i> that suspected trafficker Yeah, he's on the move again. What lane's he in, pal? [officer over radio]<i> <i> Ball drops. Push off.</i> [dramatic music] [David]<i> After documenting <i> for hours, [Greg] Yep, Rog, he's up to it. Around. [David]<i> One more <i> But unless the cars <i> thieves will continue
