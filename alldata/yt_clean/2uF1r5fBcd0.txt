[Geoff White] It's April 2022 in Silicon Roundabout, London's of a cryptocurrency startup called Aztec Network, [Jon Wu] Aztec Network is hiring aggressively, especially [Jean Lee] Jon's about to interview a job applicant so that he won't disturb his colleagues. The his resume, Bobby has submitted a cover letter. [JW] And this cover letter was generally unexceptional, but it had a very unique sign-off, and the sign-off was: Which I thought was just very Bond-villainesque. it sounded. You know, you could imagine that being [GW] Jon's thinking, bit weird, but OK, let's meet the guy. [JW] And I initiated the call and kind of the first red flag was he didn't turn his camera on. [GW] It was also somewhere incredibly noisy. [JW] Which, you know, again, it sounded not like he was at a cafe, but like he other people in there also making calls or doing kind of began this very interesting dance where noise, but he wasn't really clear when to unmute, him a question, he would stay muted, I would ask him to mute again... and so it was kind of just this [GW] When you ask the questions, [JW] He gave some extraordinarily generic answers, things like he would say I'm a successful successful, but some really glaring inconsistencies Canada, when I asked him where he was based he said had been in Hong Kong, he had a lot of trouble uh [JL] Jon is from New York and says he knew a lot of Koreans growing up, and he thinks that this mysterious Bobby Sierra is using. [JW] And so, that started to make the hairs on the back of my neck stand up a little bit, because I had and I started to say, there's enough of these red nefarious going on. And I felt uncomfortable [JL] Jon's about to find out that he had a North Korean regime is trying to worm its way [GW] Thanks to the crypto boom, there's a mind-boggling [JL] And that has caught the eye of North [Music] From the BBC World Service, this is the Lazarus Episode 8: Bitcoin Bandits [GW] After his suspicious encounter with Bobby Sierra, [JW] I'll never forget. I opened the door to our office room, &quot;I think I just interviewed a North Korean [GW] Right! What was the reaction from the room? [JW] I mean, shock of course. And yeah, I think everyone was both man, we didn't think we were high enough profile think that we'd be a target. And I think that's old me? Why would someone come after us? [GW] Just to finish off the story, by the way, you didn't offer Bobby Sierra the job then, in the end? [JW] No, unfortunately he didn't get the job. [GW] Jon can't be sure that Bobby Sierra is North Korean. He's got hunch about it. He can't figure out what a North a job at his company. [JL] Then, about two weeks after government has issued a special report warning applying for jobs. [JW] The way that North Korea does is that there are thousands, if not tens workers who pose as western or foreign nationals and of course because of the global shortage get hired at salaries much, much higher than they Korean government custodies whatever money they proportion, and then keeps the rest to fund North immediately taken back to this interview. It felt [GW] The crypto Community was totally thrown by the revelations in this US report. It job applicants may not be hackers themselves, who are, and some of them had already used the hired by a company to enable cyber intrusions. [JL] Jon's company facilitates cryptocurrency payments, and that means that at any one time, the company So it's entirely possible that Bobby planned company from the inside. Scarier still, if Bobby designing software to keep the company's systems [JW] You could in many hundreds or thousands of only you knew about, and that would be hard to find. keep that to himself and then at the right moment [GW] Jon decided to take to social media to [JW] A lot of people had the same Korean IT workers. But the craziest story that in Brooklyn, and I ran into a friend of a friend, and did you know we had a North Korean on [GW] What?! &quot;How is that possible?&quot; and he said, &quot;well, we hired And it wasn't until the FBI called us and Korean account. Did we realise that identify every single person working for us?&quot; And a member of our team, he was contributing a lot,&quot; [JL] And I'm sure the North Korean was sad to have lost were supposed to have rescinded all work visas thousands of North Korean IT workers still remain And that salary that Jon was offering is far they might make back home. It's fascinating to figuring out not just the tech skills, but also like this off. Imagine having to stay in character, a totally different backstory, for six months. And government is warning tech companies to be wary of. [GW] How do you feel about this in hindsight then? your overriding feeling? [JW] It all feels a little &quot;some cryptocurrency employees are funnelling Even that just sounds completely absurd more sceptical and paranoid about kind of not [GW] All through the making of this podcast, Jean and I involved in North Korea's secretive hacking without even trying. It's entirely possible that North Korean hackers, went to school with them, and when I was speaking to Jon, hearing all about So I asked Jon for Bobby's contact details, a secure messaging app. So I thought, what the was pretty sure this wouldn't work. Surely Bobby It was a classic investigative journalist Now, safety first: I made this call from numbers or email accounts, so I wasn't risking My call just rang and rang. I hung up. No goose for &quot;Hi, this is Bobby&quot; on Telegram. So I'm going to send him &quot;Do you have any projects for me?&quot; This is for work from this account. Next, he asked was a bit hair-raising, because LinkedIn target their victims. But by this point, he a link to The Lazarus Heist podcast for good &quot;Cool&quot;. He's had a look at my LinkedIn profile and Well that's the crux, isn't it? &quot;I co-present I put our question to Bobby. &quot;Are you working Hmm, no answer. This is where Bobby stopped ghosted me. I heard nothing more from him. So come as a surprise. I mean I had to tell him So I didn't get the interview I wanted, but I North Korea's IT workers have become so brazen, seems they're hanging out on Telegram, where we become so ravenous they're increasingly having [JL] And their tactics for breaking into crypto go well beyond trying had their sights on the world's crypto wallets in September 2020, this was about to spell very [GW] They say money never sleeps. That's the old Wall long hours come with the job, but surely there [Jing Cheung] About 4am in the morning Singapore time, I was awakened by a call, and surprisingly, call, he didn't talk much. He just said: &quot;OK, something happened [GW] This is Jing Cheung. Back in September 2020 when he received this cryptocurrency company called KuCoin. [JL] Their head office is in Singapore, overlooking Marina Bay, that's the waterfront with all those futuristic and KuCoin sounds like one of those 'work hard, play [JC] If you want, you can go to the gym in the office to have some exercises, then to take a rest. [GW] What gaming machines have you got? [JC] It's some like um computer games back in the 80s or 90s, the very old machines old-fashioned games. [GW] Seems like a job with some being called in at 4am by his bosses just to [SFX Computer game: &quot;You lose. Hahaha!&quot;] [GW] KuCoin is a crypto exchange. You can sign KuCoin. It's basically a kind of bank account for to buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, plus called, things like NFTs - non-fungible tokens, [JC] In terms of the trading volume, for instance, currently uh the average daily volume [GW] So... 5 billion dollars, is that? [JC] Yeah, US dollars, yeah. [JC] Yeah, KuCoin is top five crypto exchanges in terms of like the [JL] That kind of turnover makes KuCoin an attractive target. And that's exactly what [JC] But in the taxi, I was thinking, like, what kind the office now? It must be something really bad. would happen would be like a security incident, like the co-founders, they were already there, so I because just like when you watch a like Marvel you all know the situation is very, very tough [JL] KuCoin had been quick off Singapore time, an hour before Jing gets called in. [GW] The company security team are watching The company's wallets are being systematically the Ether, and everything else. Someone, somewhere, frantically transferring the remaining funds out ones that they hope are going to be beyond the [JC] It's like a race with the attackers because at the same time, the attackers are still [GW] The security team are gradually winning. By the time their funds to safe havens. [JL] But when the dust settles, Close to $300m of Bitcoin, Ether As the sun's rising over Marina Bay in Singapore, KuCoin's customers. Jing works on the marketing message out to their account holders that some of have to do that pretty quickly, because customers [JC] When I arrived at the office, there were already some wrong with KuCoin&quot;, and also we have a have started to panic. [GW] How did they know? Well, it's Every time you use one, like buying something with available online record called a blockchain. This Every currency's got its own blockchain, so it's all this blockchain activity that someone's [JL] By this point in 2020, crypto exchanges had around the world. There had been dozens of KuCoin is major. It's an eye-watering sum. So up online, saying yes, KuCoin has been raided. An [GW] As for that internal investigation, the first Well, KuCoin have never disclosed any details that once they're inside, the hackers got hold wallets, basically the passwords that unlock them. [JL] So that's the how figured out. As for who did it, and more urgently, where the from the big guns. [GW] They send a message to one of the other side of the world, in Washington DC, [Erin Plante] So, I was at a family picnic and I got a message stolen from an exchange. So I sit down in the it. You can start to piece it together, and you can and you just start chasing them. [GW] This is Erin Plante, That's one of the world's leading crypto tracing who track money down, Chainalysis does the same blockchain records. [JL] Erin and her colleagues help some of the world's worst criminals. [Erin Plante] We care about controlled by child abuse offenders, wallets [JL] This is amazing work, and it's helped police around [GW] Not all superheroes wear capes. And it can be family exactly what it is she does all day. [EP] Everyone says, you do what? I thought you... I thought you fixed printers?! Nobody really [GW] And it's this non-plussed response she's dealing with at the family message from KuCoin. Erin opens up some to trace the movement of cryptocurrency in real time. [EP] When some major event happens, we jump right in. There's a lot of scrambling, funds as quickly as possible so that you have [GW] Were the other guests a bit bemused by this, did you have and yes, I will have another sandwich?!&quot; [EP] Exactly! That's exactly what happens. And I've got two kids, and they were running around, they want to watch Peppa Pig on YouTube and you're [JL] You might be thinking, if you manage to steal first thing you want to do is to convert it into [GW] Well yes, that is the end goal here. It's called are only a few crypto exchanges in the world most of them are reputable, they're not in the the lookout for suspiciously large trades [JL] So this makes cashing out pretty [EP] If they're stolen by a sophisticated hacker, was, they follow a very complex laundering path. [GW] In the moments after the hackers took control of KuCoin's crypto wallets, they began moving the funds Each wallet's got an address: a string of letters account number. Using her crypto tracing software, to another. The hackers have automated this process, [EP] There's a lot of adrenaline and a lot of excitement. It's a trying to follow the car that's flying down the deviations off of the off-ramps and through immediately, in real time. [GW] But as the hackers send and back alleys of the crypto world, they're going [JL] So they also try swapping the stolen you might convert stolen dollars into euros or It's like the hackers are changing the licence [GW] But Erin's tracking software is pretty enough to throw her off the scent. And the hackers pull a trick which makes all that swapping look picnic, is watching, as the hackers send the stolen [EP] Mixers are a really popular laundering technique, of dollar bills on the table and you just sort of, they all mix together, then you take out a dollar, same one you take out. [GW] Let's explain a bit more. Imagine hunting for them, trying to get them back, so for where they're jumbled together with other people's necessarily a crook. The appeal of crypto for a lot oppressive country might use a mixer to hide their mixer runs a program that randomly shuffles all my up the dirty ones with the clean ones, and then it amount of crypto that I put into the mixer, but Mixers make it really hard for Erin to keep up. She into mixer services with names like Chip Mixer for her to establish which of the many payments the KuCoin crooks. [JL] And the KuCoin hackers can [EP] Every time they hit a mixer, it's that much harder and software, it's not an easy process. [GW] Can you not contact them and say, shuffle that money around, that's stolen money.&quot; Are [EP] They... tend to not be. [EP] So, most of the mixers, at least in the US businesses, so they're not fully illegal by any illicit services. Crypto enthusiasts will say some people just don't want their identity to be of illicit funds that go through mixers, not of other illegal activity that you want to stop, [GW] Yeah, it's interesting isn't it, there's a sort of philosophical defense meant to be anonymous. [EP] Exactly. And I know people you know, pay for something on Amazon. They just, they but there is a need to stop the illicit [JL] It's at this point, when the KuCoin funds are that Erin notices something very telling. [GW] The funds are being sent through the mixes in in a very familiar pattern. Erin's seen this hacking gang. One she's come up against [EP] Any time there is a hack of a crypto exchange, especially we sort of immediately start to at least try [JL] Cryptocurrency is the cutting edge of money. Even people who spent heads around it. But yet again, the sophisticated and laundering crypto look like child's play. [GW] North Korea has never admitted to KuCoin theft, and has consistently denied The BBC approached the North Korean embassy raised in this season of the podcast, pretty confident that it's the Lazarus [JL] But can she claw any of the stolen crypto back? she has lost sight of some of that 300 million [GW] And she's spotted something very interesting indeed. Some of a digital wallet that Erin and her colleagues [EP] Funds flowing from previous hacks that are known to be North Korea, same deposit addresses. [GW] Right, OK. So effectively, lots of different crimes goes into that one bank committed all the crimes, or at least benefitted from them all. [EP] That's exactly right, yeah. [GW] Erin can see the stolen funds, but she can't get at them. Crucially, no banks or governments or authorities accounts, the wallets controlled by these hackers enforcement. The hackers seem to have won. [JL] Except, the hackers, remember, It's no good stealing hundreds of millions If the North Korean regime wants to use it to buy luxury items like Mercedes cars or Rolexes, for money. And Erin says the Lazarus Group's preferred [GW] So, the final hurdle for the hackers is to find their stolen funds into, say, yuan. Now, having you have, it won't surprise you to learn that there where anything goes, no questions asked. Ultimately, some of the illicit gains to an exchange that's [EP] And you quickly call them and say, these funds have hit your exchange, can processes the legal paperwork to actually [JL] Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Erin can see the stolen crypto sitting now it becomes a game of patience. And Erin says [EP] Their goal is to sit on on the funds until there start to cash them out. And then they'll typically and it'll kind of sit there for a bit, um 50 Bitcoin, or you know some amount that if [GW] So they're testing different escape routes for this? [GW] And if the funds get stopped, they think, oh that escape hasn't [EP] Yep, and then they'll go back through [GW] In the KuCoin case, Erin and her Chainalysis lot of the funds to a helpful reputable exchange. mistake of moving the funds there; perhaps they [EP] So, the KuCoin funds, I believe it was about 80% that was returned. It was a that ultimately complied and returned the funds to [JL] But the KuCoin case is still an outlier. Erin says [EP] It's more likely that the funds go, and disappear. [JL] And we should not forget that in KuCoin's case, sure, a lot was recovered. But 16% of the stolen million US dollars, way more than the Lazarus and the bank of Valletta hack put together. [GW] It's also worth mentioning that KuCoin was insured against losses like this, and fortunately, they say, [JL] But $45m goes a long way in North Korea. Plus, attributed to its hackers. [GW] In fact, if you add up Lazarus Group to date, as of when we recorded this, North Korean hackers have earned way more from [JL] In fact, they're said to be responsible In March 2022, North Korea's hackers were accused Infinity. The crypto assets stolen were worth well [EP] And if you actually think about this in the dollar amount, some of this, stolen, so hacks that occurred in 2018 when the of Bitcoin is now worth so much more than that. [GW] At the time of recording this podcast, the value of Bitcoin is about $28,000 or has now become part of the game of laundering this the crypto market is peaking. It's mad to think Korea, are starting to become highly effective Do we know how much is sort of left floating about in the cryptocurrency world, they're struggling to cash out, or that they're waiting to [EP] Yeah, so we we have eyes on all of their wallets that we knew about, about half of that been able to cash out, and we have eyes on those [GW] So as soon as they, kind of, try and do something with those wallets with that money in it, rash, as they say. [EP] Yeah, we will aim to stop it. Our our investigators are going to know, whether it's picnic. You'll often see stolen funds that are [GW] US authorities are also looking for ways to cryptocurrency mixers. [JL] It's not possible just meaning that no one person or commercial entity is putting US Treasury sanctions on two mixers Group: Blender and Tornado Cash. [GW] After those sanctions came in, developers was arrested in the Netherlands. of facilitating money laundering and making [JL] The second mixer, Blender, shut down pretty much least, it appeared to. Crypto analysts claim it [GW] And Erin says that Sinbad is now the service. Another crypto tracing firm says [JL] This will be a long cat and sign of slowing down its targeting of the crypto [GW] And with billions of dollars up for grabs, it's clear the crypto market will continue to be [JL] It's frightening to me to think about this hidden, where they're going to spend it. In recent Korea has still managed to get what it wants where investigators say that so much of these to KuCoin, are ending up. [GW] It's time to look at and meet the investigators who try to stop them. [Clip] Nuclear programmes are the most secret, most closely guarded things anywhere. I'm just like a regular and I'm figuring it out. [JL] That's next time, in the [Music: The Lazarus Heist theme, by Jambinai] The Lazarus Heist is an original podcast from the BBC Our producer is Viv Jones.
