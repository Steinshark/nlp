uh... welcome to the great ways to study workshop textbook study methods and uh... i don't know if you love textbooks most people say no thank you but when people open text books and try one of the hardest aspects for most people there were no textbooks i would love college but there are textbooks these are the three topics that we're gonna related to it next week the first one we're everybody here knows what summaries are at text books have summaries at the end of each chapter no they should there should be a law but they don't of a chapter that usually covers fifteen twenty it down to one or two which is very valuable but i want to see if you can figure this out i ask students all the time when you get do you do with it what's your approach a lot of people give me a very scary answer what do you think they say yeah they say oh i don't do summaries i skipped those i say why do you skip em and usually they either and because when i get to the end of the chapter thing i'm done and so that's a simple idea and then other because everytime i look at a summary there's it's just the same thing i just read in the so why would i want to read it again in the i hope you know that's not a very good idea uh... for a person to ignore a summary usually so i'm gonna make a guess here and this is the average college class where the textbook the most classes my guess is that somewhere between seventy of everything that's in the summary is going to show up on the test in one form percent in some areas that's because the summary is made up of nothing chapter so what i want to show you is this i want you to learn if you haven't already you should be an expert at it because it should help you when the test comes and there are only two ways i know to help a person be an expert at a summary the first one doesn't work very well and that's soaks into your brain that's better than not reading it but that's an expert at this is what i'm going to teach you it's something that i used a lot when i was that helps you and it doesn't take a lot of time or effort and it's helpful that's good that's kind of what we want so i could you pass one straight to the back ok what you're looking at here when you college textbook in the area of health it's i want you to look at it take a quick glance be a very easy thing what do you notice here that looks different yep um... well yeah that to that is just the yeah blanks all over the place i don't know about you but i don't think i've regular text normally well that means that somebody actually put these blanks in there inserted them in there uh... who do you think did that yeah me boy you accuse me yeah that's right your hand which is a uh... little tool that's student what do you need to have in your hand to create you need white out right liquid paper white out or whatever you call looking at here which again didn't take hours was i've made a copy of the actual summary white-out and i read through each sentence and then and then what i was done i let it dry for and i made the blanks just so that i could okay all of that that whole process takes two quick things before i go into this anymore um... how do you know which words you're supposed to how do you determine that because you're the the white out in your hands so what kind of words do you white out yeah vocabulary the easiest answer is uh... i've had a few students misunderstand this waited out words but they whited out the word the and uh... like that and what you're trying to is like a a test a fill-in the blank test and it's very embarrassing if you do with the see a blank and you're thinking what word so what is that right so the words you take totally but they are the keywords and the um... it's a really smart move on your part not to white-out too many words not to go place on this page where i kinda went crazy yeah number three uh... blank blank blank normally you don't want to do that why did i wanted to be able to write in all the words uh... if you normally read a sentence in your the blank of the blank blank blank is blank good luck even knowing what that's asking out a little bit and if you look at this carefully i could've easily but you don't want to go overboard and there's nothing special by the way about there are thirty-six blanks on here so this um... after completing it so that it looks what you would do would be to go to the cheapest to ten copies of this and then take them home you can do this what i just described before it afterward anytime it doesn't matter and then that this is the summary of how much of this information are you supposed yeah all of it i've had some people say right because probably most of it is going you know it only one way to find out you go to your stash of uh... little quizzes you grab one you fill in the blanks as many as you can when you're done you correct it and what do answer key what's the answer key yeah the actual summary in the book right so to correct it i always used to do this by correcting in sort of see where you messed up and then what meaning that this is my first attempt and study it for a while and then you put it away and you go away for even if it's an hour or two now quick question for you uh... how do you time you try what do you think yeah not so good and i've had some people say oh no i get a hundred percent and i said wow how intelligent you are that's so great why because i'm the one who took the words out so i know which ones they are and whenever somebody says that to me i look i think you're giving yourself way too much what i just showed you and then you put them take it it'll be almost like someone else made it on any test so i'm gonna give you a number that's just an time you take this you get fifteen right out of thirty six now that's less than half so what grade is yeah f not a c_-minus minus minus it's an f it's never fun in life ever to get an f on was often i would think i've just got an f i'm so glad i got this on the real test right cuz is no harm no foul it doesn't count ok later on that day or blank copy and i sit for a few minutes and correct it study it put a two in the corner put it that over and over as many times as you can now the second time you take it how should yeah uh... better how much better i don't know if you do worse come see me because something is going on but let's say you get twenty three out of thirty six so that's a nice big improvement well if you percentage now you've got a d so then you can go to anybody you live with i just got a d and they're saying why are you so excited say well in other words things are getting better right and then the tends to help in addition to what i've already test you grab your last copy maybe it's the you take it one last time how are you going to do on it the last time yeah you should uh... let's say this let's you get thirty five out of thirty six because everybody here knows what grade that is right i forgot to mention earlier that what some time and they did really badly and so they crumble it up and threw it away but you don't want to do that you keep them have this final payoff you grab all seven copies or however many there are and you find a table or the floor in your all out one two three four five ectera and and then look at the last one and then just okay and what are you admiring yeah your progress your improvement right and what is yeah confidence if i had you read this summary five times and then you came back here some other day and i was going to give you i said are you ready you know everything really well all you can do if you read this five times hope so i read it a lot and i think it's in there somewhere do this you have physical proof of the fact that always encourages people now want to tell you one last thing about this this should be kind of obvious but i always if you uh... study this way it's a very helpful way whenever you have just knowing what words go in a bunch of blanks doesn't make you completely ready to take study in other ways as well but again the idea back to this is that would be on your test and if you don't know that's usually a bad sign so you continue to do it's pretty simple and it's also kind of turns it into a little to see if you can do better each time and staring at it hour after hour ok so that's ok um... the second one of the three that we're is a method that most people have never heard actually works great in certain textbooks not all but in certain ones and that's called what i'm gonna do to teach you this is i'm sort of backwards instead of explaining what with you so you're gonna learn by doing and you to do me a favor i'm gonna hand it upside which is kind of a strange way and i don't want you to turn it over because i want us to turn it over at the same can just keep it in front of you but no peeking yep in just a minute when everybody's set i'm gonna ask you to turn the page over and to read this together i'm gonna read it uh... outloud you just follow along silently and we're not gonna read the whole page that certain sentences that have been selected sentences we're gonna read because they're on there and what i want you to try to do you to try is stay with me as i read the sentences and things on the page i know there's a temptation but just focus on what were doing and then this a little bit so go ahead and turn it one eating disorders are grouped into three categories number two obesity is the condition of being to the extent that a person's health and life the majority of cases of obesity are psychologically some have been demonstrated to have a biological number four bulimia is sometimes called the silent killer because it is difficult to detect number five this disorder involves a cycle six anorexia nervosa is a nutritional deficiency disease characterized okay now here's what i want you to do i'm gonna give you about a minute and i want as many times as you can don't read anything else on the page again your brain and then i'm gonna put you to the test on learn these a little bit better alright what i'd like everybody to do is go so that you can't see it no peaking okay and i'm gonna ask uh... just for volunteers really quickly to go through what was one of the eating disorders on the bulimia another one obesity and anorexia nervosa um... the definition was given for obesity and it was kinda long so it's always kinda it says the person is overweight and two things anybody remember one or both health and life wow you're doing well health um... what is the source of obesity usually according psychological and then every once in awhile biological and what's the nickname given to bulimia silent killer why's it called that hard to detect and what does it involve binge and purges and then the last part and if you can get amazed the definition was given for anorexia nervosa long definition it describes it as a certain kind of disease and also describes the weight loss with two what do you remember ohhh everybody got quiet all of a sudden that's uh... that's almost exactly right what nutritional deficiency disease you can read that twenty times and it's hard and then it's severe and prolonged those are the weight loss ok back over and uh... what we just did was called reading it but now we want to go back and figure out what was that all about what is that and um the basic way you do this is that you read certain sentences that you've and then you test yourself on what you just and every time you can't remember something what do you do yeah you cheat oh yeah and then you say it and you keep practicing the whole thing like we just did ok so uh... what is this all about well when you read in layers this method the first two are the most common for sure when you look at these sentences and you look all of those have something in common with i want to see if you can figure out what that is it three four and six where are those yeah beginning of a paragraph so the number of this is that you read the first sentence of each paragraph okay in those obviously aren't hard to find why is it may be helpful to read the point of that yeah topic sentence and then what does the give details right now is that always the way paragraphs are written no uh... if i were made the king of all text cuz it makes your job a lot easier as a student paragraph's the last sentence or it's buried confusing but a lot of textbook authors actually write where most of the time the first sentence big fact and that helps you so that's why now sentence number two is not the first sentence and this is hard for people to see so you have to just the word obesity at the start of sentence it doesn't really look like it that much because is so the second type of sentence you read when any sentence with a bold print word and again those are easy to find you don't why is it important to read a sentence with right so the author is saying this is an important so these are pretty easy and then there's only one sentence here that we haven't number five if you look at that that is not the first sentence so why was that pick and the answer is in the sentence right before it sentence four if you look carefully at sentence four you know but it also has a bold print word the word bulimia so when i was doing this when i was setting and i saw that it had a bold print word and it's the what did i assume i would read in that sentence yeah the definition of it right did i get that in there no i got an interesting little nickname right what it was so i had to look a couple sentences and then i found it so what does that mean well it means this the last part of what you do which won't happen a lot but every once in awhile is you read any other sentence that seems important so even if it's not the first sentence of even if it has no bold print words if for your eyes are drawn to it you read that to ok and when you do this with text books by the way you're not supposed to get out your pen or number the sentences in your book the reason wanted you to uh... look but obviously you so you just basically read ok now this is how you do it it doesn't work with all text books because sentence has something significant but what the purpose when people first learn how to do this they oh this is going to be my favorite reading idea skip all kinds of stuff and think how fast you could read a chapter you think oh man i'm a speed reader this is great uh... sorry to tell you this is not a substitute for reading the whole thing if i gave everybody in here a test right pass to get an a if i actually gave you a test on the whole it would be an f for everbody because you so this is actually a step of preview it's something that you do first and then and people always say you mean there's something else i have to do i'd rather just read it but the purpose for this by the way let me go ahead and uh... start the sign-up sheet if you would uh... is this when people read the sentences that i've shown you first and everything else they read once they start they've already learned it's almost like they labeled them and every fact they just sort of stick in and usually when you do that first and go fits into your brain and you remember it that's the purpose behind this and so again uh... for it's almost too late for now because for spring when you first get into a class that has a i remember that reading in layers method take one page read the first sentence of each paragraph and sentences of bold print words just that and when you're done you'll either think wow that which means that that book is probably good you'll get to the end of that you'll think and the reason is because in that book it may be that the first sentence of each and the main important points are way down further so then this won't work so you can of clicks or not ok any questions on this one all right okay this is from an anatomy book i don't know like a separate foreign language that you and um... the information at the on this page which you'd never know unless somebody told the brain different parts of the brain and this uh... as you look at the top you see that three pages how could i fit three pages worth of textbook it's because the rest of it was all diagrams of the brain so this is the actual text from this and then i'll get to the point behind the white matter underlying the cortex consists extending in three principal directions one association fibers transmit nerve impulses to comissural fibers transmit impulses are you kidding to learn this not only do you have a dictionary by this is only three pages out of a thirty so can you imagine learning ten times this much well rather than learning it this way by just reading there's another way that i think you're gonna it has to do with outlining and so i want you to keep that handout uh... in front of you for just a minute and i'm gonna give you another handout that with that one and then i'm gonna do an exercise incredibly sharp on that first one so now i'm at my expectations are really high take a look at this right beside your other kind of back and forth ok um... as you see on the uh... original page the actual text there are two main topics on that page which then you look over on the outline and what the two main topics white matter and basil ganglia so in other these two are exactly the same except the put on the page ok and i want to demonstrate this handout the first one of the two and i want you to turn that over so you can't and i just want you to keep this uh... outline so that means i need to hear a lot of voices don't raise your hand i just want you i'm gonna ask you a few questions first with so that's about as easy as it's ever going so again how many topics are on this page two what's the first one white matter second one basal ganglia underneath white matter there are two what's the first one basic fact second one types of fibers ok now that's pretty easy right so you can't see it how many topics are on the page two first one white matter second one under white matter how many topics two first one basic facts second one types of fibers how many basic facts are there how many types i don't know... we haven't looked yet go ahead and take ok again same repeat just repeat with me k two first one white matter second one basal ganglia under two first one how many three second one types of fibers how many three okay and then take a look under types of fibers and you when you look at the first letter of each what word can you make out of those three you can make two actually one would be cap the other one would be pac well we'll go ahead let's go ahead and use cap alright which one is this some of you are looking at me like what's the answer let's start here again what's this one comissural and projection ok now turn it back over and ok how many topics are on the page two uh... what's the first one white matter the second one basil ganglia yeah under white matter how many topics two first one basic facts second one types of fibers uh... how many basic facts are there three what are they i don't know...um how many types of fibers three ok what's this one comissural... yeah what's this one association and projection now before we go any further when you leave and or maybe even when you get home somebody if they say what did you do in school today workshop and i learned some things what did you learn well i learned that in the white matter of and they look at you and go wow that's very impressive you say well uh... to remember that most effectively and the c is for comissural the a is for association and the p is for projection and they look at you man you learned a lot today and then here's what what do those different fibers do and you say gotta go and then you run right because you haven't so go ahead and turn the page if we continued with this what you would be doing is and again this start on the left and you keep repeating and then you add one little layer each time would do would be to learn the basic facts and then about uh... what the truths were about the just kind of layering on each set of facts now uh... if i uh... tested you next week in the workshop and a by the way gonna come back but just assuming okay that had when you walked in i gave you a test uh... but i said this i said you know uh... when you leave uh... you're not allowed to take both of these you're only allowed to take one that's all which one would you take to study yeah almost everybody says the outline I say well why ok it's the same thing but the way it's packaged people a lot of times people look at this and you see all the words that are in bold print those are all terms that i would need to know and if you read this and you highlighted certain you'd have no real idea whether you had but if you actually studied the outline and you kind of did it the at the very end you'd realize that you learned now it would be nice if every text book had every page like this than everybody would get a's in every class it's not the case uh... can you take the time to take everything your own uh... yes if you never wanna sleep again and sit there it takes time to do but my main not true everybody but most people learn a lot better when they can see connections seeing a bunch of black ink on a paper and if you are ever in a class that's pretty and you read through one or two pages and filled with one definition after the other kind of then you just think it how in the world am what you do is say let me try to make an for me to study um one of these days after this semester is over paper airplanes out of them or use them as scratch paper you can always sit for a little while and go back and look back and forth and try to see how constructed sometimes people look at this well small a three and it seems like it's extremely complicated but it's not that difficult once you are able and of course most things you get in college advanced and difficult so if you can learn how you should be able to learn how to do it with goal of all of this is to say again that this class if you tried to do this with the math textbook have fun i don't think that would work so strategies and tools and then figure out which that book as opposed to that one and no method works great for every book and also no method works great for every student but if you have all these as kind of ammunition early in the semester and find out what the and there should be one sometimes people can even use two or three uh... in the same class other times only one whatever works is kind of helpful okay so uh... any questions on this one clear to everybody okay and then i want you to look up at me do not look down what are the three fibers again comissural association and projection when you leave here in a minute if i walk down the hall and i hear you saying cap cap comissural i'll be so happy in my entire life well it just shows you that when you learn something sticks and then you can show off your knowledge questions cuz then you gotta run ok ok thank get uh the sign in sheet..
