And then, okay, here we go. Ooh, it's hot. Hot! - [Rico] Aha, look at that. All right, so what do we have here? We have our sink, double top loading, nice, right here. And then these- - [Rico] A light. - [Victoria] Nice. And then these are actually, but on the next model you can I mean it's a semi-custom interior so you can kind of decide what you want and order it that way. - [Rico] Pretty convenient, big, big storage bins. of storage here. - [Rico] Love it.

Just gotta be careful - [Victoria] You can stop, you - [Rico] There we go. I just wanna show you, we which is drainable. Really cool, goes all the way through, so you could have, for example, a couple of Seabobs in Especially, the Seabobs are kinda heavy, so it would be definitely having them right here and actually drop them in the water. - Yeah, agreed, well, you were smart. You wear your boat shoes today and I'm am gonna suffer through. It's very hot, you guys. Doesn't matter what teak you - [Rico] It's warm. You need boat shoes. - I feel like I'm an amateur today.

(Rico and Victoria laugh) Okay, so I'm just gonna manage this, since it's too hot for me to stand on. power cable, it's a little - It's all right, so- - [Rico] We can show it anyways, right? - [Rico] Me? You? - [Rico] All right, so we have a massive side-boarding door here. - Yeah, look how cool. I mean, you guys imagine when it's open. So you have this really Close this up. - [Rico] So this is actually where your swim ladder goes. Those are rails! which you can pull out, from your swim, you have of the water. - This is brilliant. - [Rico] And this is on both sides. - [Victoria] Have you - [Rico] No, not yet, this is a first, and it's very convenient. - Honestly, for this this is an NBBL. I think whoever is building one, put that on your NBBL. That is brilliant. - [Rico] I agree. So let's close this back up here. - And then- - And then underneath the floor, we actually have another And that's where the swim ladder sits in, folds over the sides, and you don't need to hook anything in. It's fixed mounted there, Really, really cool. And easy to clean up afterwards, too. You just rinse it off - [Victoria] Oh, this is great. I'm just gonna sit here and....- No, no, no, not like that. Okay, so we do have our This is a huge sitting if you wanna hang out all together. There's storage underneath here, and these, I can show you one of these, just as an example. - [Rico] Yep. Actually we have a fire Storage compartments. - Exactly. and another Garmin panel, actually, there to control all the functions on the boat. Like I said, speakers everywhere. And very cool, they put 'em behind the - You're just soaking wet. - I am? All right. It is really hot, so we with us today, and we are because there's a lot of- - A lot of hydraulic So can you make it a - [Robert] Yes, of course. - [Rico] That's a very good idea. - I don't know why we - [Rico] Why didn't we - I don't know.

(Rico laughs) - I mean, did we just score, or what? Way overqualified. - [Rico] I'm feeling very small right now. I have a 200-ton license, so. - [Robert] Whoa. - [Rico] Yeah. - So it does go all the way up to be a normal kind of so you can actually have dinner here, or you can leave it low as a lounge table. I mean, it's pretty amazing. - It's not just a table, That's pretty cool, two in one. - [Victoria] I feel like this is the ultimate transformer yacht here. Everything transform into something. - [Rico] Oh, wow, look at this. So these are the two bases of the table. And they're fitting just, which is here in the center. Really, really cool. Got the lithium ion batteries Got a Spectra watermaker And then after that, fuel tanks. All right. - [Rico] Good access. - Let's close this up and - [Rico] Lounging? There are so many automated It's unbelievable. - [Rico] All the equipment! hydraulics... everything is extending and going in, and- - I think you need some good training to be able to know where - I think it's a lot of pages. everything from the helm, right? - [Robert] Yes. - [Rico] And then, how for controls there? - [Robert] Nine pages. - [Rico] Nine pages. - Well, you guys will see why. - We will show you, we'll - [Rico] All right, there was - Yes, so right here, in and eat all day long and thank you, Robert, check this out. (mellow music) I cannot tell you guys how much of a difference this - [Rico] Oh yeah. Huge difference. - Incredible, so since you to demonstrate, that's what you would do. - I love it. - It's amazing. Okay. being at anchor, nice, shady spot. - Oh yeah. - Someone's barbecuing out there, you're just hanging out. you see all the action happening - With a cocktail. - Love it. - So we're gonna go forward. Shall we go this way? - [Rico] Sure - [Rico] Well, before we we have two fridges here drink fridges. You know what, since I'm there are another two fridges- - No way! Equal. - You've got four fridges? - All right, this is not but welcome to the in the helm area. First of all, may I just What does this remind you guys of? The crazy roller coasters? - [Rico] Roller coasters, exactly. But you know what? Looks - Right? Okay. I'm sure there's a trick to this. Robert, is it this buttons? - [Robert] Yes. - Okay. (chair whirring) Not broken. - [Rico] All right. - And this is way too tall so- - [Victoria] Ah, there we go. - [Rico] There we go. - So I'll get up here, there's - [Rico] And a little birdie told me that they're actually suspended. - Yes. - Are you serious? - Yes. - So it's a very comfortable ride. - Yes. Well, we get to experience it. behind here is a whole mechanism where the seat can actually absorb some of the boat's movement. - Wow. So I can't wait. I'm sorry you guys don't but you're just gonna have to believe us when we are gonna take this one out. - [Rico] Because any speed you already start having over the waves. So that probably saves - So really comfortable, We've got a nice handrail to grab onto. Sorry, I'm leaving marks. I'm afraid to touch anything, it's so hot. And then of course, the three seats here. And then as we go forward, we've got four seats on our first row. - [Rico] That's right. - Okay, let's, oh, actually, that I've missed, right? - [Rico] Yeah. Let's go forward. More forward. Okay, so we're at the helm and we're probably gonna - Yes. - Okay, (laughs) well, why don't you guys do - Okay. and then Robert can- - So this is obviously the This is hydraulic, eh, Robert? - How is your visibility? - Yeah, it probably wouldn't hurt if I would be half a foot taller. - [Victoria] So let's get you taller. - I think, can I stand on this? - [Robert] Oh yes. - Okay, oh! Oh, look at that. Yeah, that's fantastic. That's perfect, right there. Look at that. - [Victoria] Look at that! - Yeah, if mother Nature didn't - You're not as tall as Robert? - I don't need it. - Cigarette does. (All laugh) - [Victoria] You won't tell - Oh, okay, good. - I feel good for a second, yeah. - [Victoria] Okay. - Anyways, I mean, very, very Got the shifter for motor controls. Bow and stern thruster. - [Victoria] Wow. why you would need a but hey, you know what? If you have it, you have it, right? - [Victoria] It doesn't hurt. - VHF radio, three Garmin chart plotters, which can also be used for the cameras, can be used for the yacht, or for the boat management system, chart plotter, do we have a radar? Probably, right? - Yes, we have. so radar, all the on these three screens and where you want it. You got the Mercury So we have the start and stop buttons for the Mercuries here. Six of them. - [Victoria] Wow, oh, - Yeah, start/stop each one, yes. - Individual, yeah. - Got it. battery switches, navigation lights, bilge pumps, the horn. It's a good horn? - Yes. - [Rico] Should we press it? - [Victoria] No. - [Victoria] Stop it! - Look at the guys over there. - No, it doesn't matter. (horn honks) - Yep. - [Rico] Working, yeah. - [Robert] Super loud. (laughs) - [Victoria] Wow. That's a good horn. I didn't expect that. (Rico claps) I did not expect it, you guys. - They shook. (laughs) - Sorry, guys. - [Victoria] You're terrible. - Not sorry. - Continue, continue, continue. Do we have two trim controls here? You can trim all, and then, I guess, separately, right? - One individual, got it. If you need to trim out a little bit, because you have too many heavy people on one side of the boat or so. - [Victoria] Why are you looking at me? - No, no, no, no, no. I look in the mirror. (laughs) - [Victoria] Come on. glove compartments here, cup holders, actually- - [Rico] Nice aluminum, brushed aluminum. - [Victoria] Cool. Good sized cup holders. Look at the size. You can put the big, what is it called? The Big Gulp in there, - [Victoria] Yeah, well hopefully not, but you do need some good here, for sure. - And then got some USB outlets here if you wanna charge your phone or iPad, whatever you have with you. - All right. really cool thing as a captain, you have air condition coming out, right here. - Yes. It really helps. I mean you feel, you stand here, you feel five, 10 degrees cooler. - [Victoria] Well you're by other people, so it - That's true. - So it's nice to have. So that's for the helm. - [Victoria] So the second row- - Unless I missed something. - [Victoria] Did he miss anything, Robert? - No. You missed something - (gasps) We did? back to the back. going back. - [Victoria] What did we miss? - [Rico] What did we miss? - [Robert] Right here a 50-foot water hole, fresh water, that way you can able to- I just thought it's secondary electrical. - That way you can wash your boat. - Nice. - [Rico] So you have the hose on a wheel. - Yes. - [Rico] That is amazing. - I love that. - [Rico] That is really, really cool. - Yes. - We missed it. - [Rico] Yeah. it was an electrical output. - [Rico] Yeah, unless you're an owner who doesn't wash the his own boat, then I guess you don't - But it's nice for crew, that's for sure. Okay, you ready? Comes in very handy. - So the second row is than the first row, and they've actually created - [Rico] No way. - [Victoria] It's a little wind door. - [Victoria] And why would make, yeah, why make that mechanical? Why wouldn't you automate that too, right? - [Victoria] Well, everything and electric, so just continue with it. - [Rico] Does it make a - [Robert] Oh yes. - [Robert] Yeah, you don't - [Victoria] Nothing? - [Victoria] Amazing. That little door, huh? - All right. So I propose we go all the way forward. Very hot there, so and then come back and - [Rico] Cool. - And then we're gonna take it out. - [Rico] Okay. - Let's do it. Okay, going forward. Wish me luck. - [Rico] Very comfortable. - [Victoria] Hot! - [Rico] Again, I love for the speakers, amazing. Big, huge subwoofers, look at that. - Just when you think, &quot;Well, there's gonna be I mean, what could possibly be here, there's a few things here as well. - [Rico] Well, before we - [Victoria] This is very cool. So this is just so your bum is in there and your legs are up and you - [Rico] Exactly. - From here, the view of the - [Rico] Very well designed. - It is so slick. just continues on as you - So you've got three people sitting here. And if you also would like to sit forward, which is one of the best spots underway, I absolutely love it, but just when you're nicely cruising, they've actually created - [Rico] Ah, that is amazing. So you don't have to have it at all times. You can actually tuck it away. - I mean, how amazing is this? - Look at that. and so you have this nice backrest here. - [Rico] That is very cool. - It's fabulous. Put it back? - [Rico] Yeah. And then we have another screen here where you can control your music, you can control the lights, entire yacht management - They also build in a They're also nice and big. - [Rico] Well, I guess- - You know it's an American shipyard when they put in proper cup holders and they don't look like these that you see. for the Red Bull cans, yeah. Also, I mean, you know, if you can go almost 90 miles an hour, you'd probably want to have - Definitely. I mean, if you're gonna go that fast, you take everything away, - [Rico] This comes up? - Yeah, so Robert, this is a table, right? the button's behind you. - [Robert] You have a button there. - I can do it. Table up. (table whirring) - [Rico] I wonder how many on this boat. - Don't know. It's a good question. You guys get the idea. This table comes all the way up, so you can have a nice seating area here. And then all of these So you have plenty of extra I'm gonna put this back. (mellow music) You see all the integrated There are lights, and then this here... - [Rico] Another hatch. Ah, look at that. That is great. So we got fender storage down here, actually really deep storage and also access to the bow thruster. - And then this here. I think I spoke too soon. - [Rico] Oh yeah. Oh, wow! Look at this, a drum windlass actually. Like you have on big That is really, really cool. - [Victoria] Not something you expected. - [Rico] No. - [Victoria] But I guess if and you've got chain bouncing there, it could be very dangerous. - [Rico] That is a good point, actually. This is nicely wrapped onto the drum. So you don't have anything sloshing around in the anchor locker. - Yeah, I mean, it could - [Rico] So then let's, (hatch clicking) So guys, look at this here. The anchor locker looks super clean, very nice stainless steel chain for the little bit of chain and then the anchor all the way forward. Very clean and very safe setup. - [Victoria] So we have - [Rico] Good looking boat. All right, let's go back. Oh! - [Rico] Forgot. about something else - So we have the radar, we have antennas, we have and oh, the antenna's (Victoria laughs) You guys guessed it, right? Motorized antenna, For the bridge clearance you can just pop 'em down electrically, and then after the bridge, How cool is that? - Wow. Do you guys see this? Unbelievable. No more climbing up on the side when you go through a bridge. That is amazing. It's kind of funny the and down individually, it was - [Rico] And I think, honestly, you probably pop 'em down too. - Yeah, exactly. - All right. and show you the state room, (mellow music) All right, let's show you the state room. This is also electric, right? It's not manual. - All right, let's go check out the cabin. Come on down. - [Rico] Immediately as we're walking in, we have a bunch of breakers down there. Have the JL Audio head unit here, and then the ignition switches, key switches right here underneath. Of course, another when you walk in, and your - Close the door behind you. - [Rico] Close the door. - Please. - I think it's right there. Oh, thank you. (Rico laughs) - [Rico] Okay. - All right.

I mean, honestly. - Yeah, you can bring the trim up 20% or something like that. - 20%? - One more up. Up, go all the way. - [Victoria] Did you say, &quot;All the way&quot;? - All the way. - [Victoria] Oh, shit. (motors roaring) - [Robert] Yeah, bring more. Put on 20%. - There we go. - You feel it? - Yep. (motors roaring) Wow. - Problem when we let him drive, he forgets that there's a camera. He's just... Which is good, he focuses only on driving. - What camera? - But then when you don't get it- - I should have not stopped so quickly, because you're like... - [Victoria] Yeah, that's why I was like, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; It really stops, I mean, when you go, wow. - [Victoria] Does it respond?
