Hey, look who's here. Hey, dad. Wait, aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye? Apparently not. Do you see how rude he is to me? Yeah. It's terrible. I'll talk to him. I wish you would, because. Wait, wait. Alan. Oh! Oh, sorry. Alan, have you been badmouthing me? Uh, badmouthing you to. To whom? To Jake. Oh, to Jake? No. Why? His attitude towards me lately is so disrespectful. I have to wonder where he's getting it from. Well, I can assure you, I always make it a point to speak well of you in front of our son. Well, what about your brother? Oh, with Charlie, I'm completely honest. That is not what I meant. I know. Hey, Judith. Charlie, have you said derogatory things about me to Jake? No. Why did you want me to? I don't understand why he's behaving like this. Ignoring me. Avoiding me. Acting like I'm the enemy. But you get why I'm doing it, right. I got it. Well, Judith, I don't know what to tell you. He's certainly not getting his attitude from us. Absolutely not. It's your mother. You talk to her. Hell, no. I talked to her last time. Choose you for it. Odds. Once, twice. Three shoot. Odds. You got to talk to her. No. Hey, but you said. I lied. Leave a message at the beep. Beep. I wish there were a better way to deal with mom. There is, but we're both too pretty for jail. What? Hey, how do I look? Incredible. All men want to be you. All women want to be with you. Can you at least look at me before you answer? I stand corrected. All men want to be with you. Charlie. Come on. I am really nervous here. This is my first real date since college. What the hell is this? Bourbon. You drink bourbon while you work out. Gin makes me sweat. Look, don't turn this into a bigger deal than it needs to be. You met a woman. You asked her out to dinner. Not technically. She asked me out. See, I was in the market, and she needed advice on picking out corn. And there were no employees around because there never are. And even if they are, they're not knowledgeable, at least about produce anyway. Thank God you were there. Tell me about it. So I explained that you have to partially husk a few ears to check the firmness of the kernels. Next thing you know, she asked me out. Well, I guess that's why they say no one gets more action than a green grocer. They say that? No, the point is, it's just dinner. You'll go. You'll bore her to death. You'll come home. Yeah, I know, but I want to look good while I'm doing it. You look fine. Just relax. Be yourself. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Oh, you think I should bring some condoms? Why? Well, I see the public service commercials. Yeah. You're right. See you later. Oh, feel the burn. I think it's going well. So I decided if I was going to get my boobs done, I might as well go whole hog, you know what I mean? Yeah, I know what you mean. You're still pretty natural looking, don't you think? You fooled me. Oh, yeah. I got to get right up on him before you can tell. I think they're really going to help me reach my career goals. Uh, do you remember what they were? What What were? My career goals. Yeah, sure. You want to be an actress, right? No, silly. I want to be a talk show host. Right. Course, what they don't tell you is big boobies equal bad back. Say that three times fast. No thank you. Big boobies. Equal bad back. Big boobies. Equal bad back. Big boobies. Equal bad back. Get your skinny little butt in here, and I'll interview you standing up. I'll be right there. Okay. We're back. Now, let's give a warm, soapy welcome to my next guest and my close personal. Friend, Charlie Harper. Hey, where are you off to? I don't know. Anywhere. Charlie, the shower's still running. I'm fine. There you are. Charlie! Charlie! Help me! Hang on. Nothing. Go watch TV. Yeah, right. What are you doing? I'm working. You're not gonna get much done with the TV on. What are you, my mother? Your mother says that too? Listen, when you're writing music for a living, you have to wait for inspiration. Nope. Not yet. Hey, Charlie, you want to come to the movies with us? You can't. He's working. On what? Liver failure. Wonderful. He's my mother. You're my doctor. Oh, I assume you finished reading Lord of the flies for your book report? Uh huh. Oh, good. How'd you like it? I thought it was a timeless American classic. I see, so tell me, what's it about? You mean the book? Yeah. The book. Um, it's called Lord of the flies, and it's about a really big fly that all the other flies pray to. And you thought he didn't read it? Oh, I was just joking. It's more like Charlotte's Web, but from the fly's point of view. Oh, Jake, you've had more than a week. Well, why didn't you read the book? Um. I've been waiting for inspiration. Attaboy. Okay. How's this for inspiration? We're not going to the movies, and you're not doing anything else until you finish reading that book. It's not fair. Of course it's fair. We had a deal, and you didn't keep your end of it. Oh, so now two wrongs make a right. Bet you didn't see that one coming. Look, Jake, you're really gonna like this book if you give it a chance. It's about kids stranded on a deserted island. How'd they get stranded? Their plane crashes. Oh, really? Then what happens? Well, this one kid named Ralph becomes their leader, and they form the society and just read the book. One big fly, huh? Hey, I took a shot. Two white wines and a jack and ginger. Please tell me that Jack and Ginger isn't for you. No, it's for my girlfriend. Why? Well, you look like a woman of discriminating taste. And mixing a quality bourbon with ginger ale is like putting Cheez Whiz on lobster newburgh. Well, what if I said that Jack and Ginger was for me? Well, then I'd learn to live with it. Charlie. Gale. Sorry I'm late. I stopped off at Radio Barn and wait till you see what I got. Alan, I'm kind of in the middle of. Damn you to hell! What? What did I do? Forget it. It's who you are. You can't help yourself. Okay. Anyway, check this out. You know what that is? A two megapixel full color webcam. Right. How do I do it? See, I got one for me and one for Jake, and we can hook them up to our computers so that when he's over at his mother's, we can have video chats whenever we want. Wow. That's extremely cool. Isn't it? Yeah. With a couple of these, phone sex becomes less phone and more sex. Charlie, I got these to maintain my relationship with my son. That's the worst part of the divorce. Is only seeing him on weekends. Well, I get that, and I sympathize. But you can see the validity of my vision, too, right? Oh, look. Built in microphone. Totally hands free. Perfect. Excuse me. Hey, Gale. Good to see you again. Don't move. Don't talk. Are you Charlie Harper? Yeah. Why? You were right. It's him. What? What? What's funny? Nothing. So, listen, can I. Can I buy you a drink? He wants to buy me a drink. Then what? We go back to your beach house. Sit on the deck. Look at the stars, talk about how you love being an uncle and how maybe someday you'd like to have kids of your own. And by the way, I have the most beautiful eyes in the world. I'm sorry. Have we met before? No. And we're not going to meet now. Okay. I have a bad feeling. What's that? My high school yearbook. Hey, do you remember a girl named Jamie Eckleberry? No. Yeah, sure you do. She used to hang out at the house all the time. Oh, yeah. Euckleberry hound. Not a name she was fond of. Yeah, I didn't make it up. I just spread it around. What about her? Oh, she called the alumni association and tracked me down. How does that work? They later sniff one of your sweaters. She emailed me. She's in town on business, and I invited her over. Great. I'll get out of your way. Just keep her off the good rug. Very funny. No, for your information, it's not a date. She's just a friend. Who, by the way, has become very successful in her field. Oh, that's nice that she has a field to run around in. It's getting old, Charlie. In people years or dog years? Sorry. Oh, look. You remember Miss Hanrahan? Oh, sure. I had her for sophomore English. I had her in the teacher's lounge. Oh, that's Jamie. Be nice. I'm always nice. Ask Miss Hanrahan. I'm serious. Relax. I'm just gonna say hello. Scratch her behind the ear, and then I'm out of here. You done with the dog jokes? Yes. Good. I hope she looks fetching. Okay, I guess I had one more. Alan. Jamie. Woof! Uh oh. Oh! Oh, crap. Oopsie. Oh, Charlie. Hey, buddy. Hey, uncle Charlie. Waiting for a fun weekend. He's not gonna have a fun weekend, Charlie. He's going to study for a history test on Monday. Well, if believing that gets you back in your car, I'll play along. Where's Alan? He's not here. Really? I told him I was on my way. That might be why he's not here. Okay. I'll just have to go over everything with you. I'm going to visit my parents for a few days, so I won't be picking Jake up till Wednesday. That means Alan has to take him to school. Monday is soccer practice. He has his math tutor and his guitar teacher on Tuesday afternoons. Hang on, hang on, hang on. Oh. Hi, Judith. Alan, why are you avoiding me? I'm not avoiding you as much as hiding. Thank you. Why were you hiding? Why does the wounded gazelle hide from the stealthy jaguar? Why does the helpless piglet hide from the ravenous wolverine? Animal planet. You learn a lot. We need to talk about your pain in the ass, mother. You know, I would love to, but as Charlie told you, I'm not here. I let her take Jake out to dinner, and when she brought him home, she lectured me for 15 minutes about his dirty ears. 15 minutes? Huh? How long is this gonna take? Like I'm a bad parent. Let her try and get a Q-Tip in a squirming 11 year old boy's ear. Mom didn't believe in Q-tips. She had a squirt gun. You know, the wooly meerkat of Western Africa buries her cubs up to their necks and licks their ears clean. What? It seemed apropos. You need to tell your mother. If she wants to spend time with her grandson, she needs to back off. Okay, I'll tell her. Thank you. I'll tell Alan you stopped by. Well, this is going to be a sucky weekend. Try spending it with an 11 year old who does nothing but complain. You mean me? No wonder they're going to write your name in your underwear. What am I supposed to do? Watch TV? There's nothing on. Play a video game. I played them all. Read a book. Yeah right. Who's the moron now? Okay, here's a rainy day activity. There are 12 college basketball games on this weekend. Dial this number and ask for coop. Tell him you're calling for Mr. Bojangles. And write down everything he tells you. Do I get to make some of the picks this time? You got money? If you pay me what you owe me. Are you getting an education here? That's priceless. What's going on? Just talking about picking colleges. I like Duke. Over Wake Forest? I got a hunch. You've got him thinking about college already. You're welcome. So how'd it go with the doctor? Uh. Sit down. I have to tell you something. What? The doctor wants me to have a procedure. What kind of procedure? He says I'm fine, and it's routine, but I'm really freaked out about it. What procedure? A colonoscopy? Oh, jeez. Alan, that's no big deal. You're just going to shove a camera up your ass. Okay. In all future references to this procedure. Can we please use the word glide or slide as opposed to shove? Don't sweat it. Every guy eventually has to get one of those. It's strictly a fact finding mission. You've had one? No. Are you crazy? But I hear there's nothing to worry about. It's a tiny little camera. Count your blessings. In the old days, they'd send a sketch artist up there. Besides, you're unconscious the whole time. That's what I'm worried about. I'll be in a very vulnerable position. I could do anything. Alan, it's not a pirate ship. Just relax. It'll be over before you know it. Yeah, I'll bet that's what they say on pirate ships. Did you just get up in the morning and figure out ways to make me crazy? Is that what you do? You plot it out. How can I make Alan miserable today? How can I reach into his chest, rip out his heart and suck it dry? Mom or ex-wife? Ex-wife. Hi, Judith. Charlie says hello. She says, &quot;hi.&quot; You're evil and selfish, you know that? No, no, I think that is a helpful comment. I pay you alimony and child support so that you can have a nice house, a nice car every weekend, free, because I've got Jake. And yet you're telling me you need a vacation? Oh, really? Oh, really? And what exactly is stressing you out, Judith? Is it the weekly manicure? The housekeeper boob lift, the boob lift that you paid for, that I paid for and never got to see and never got to see? No, no, no, you listen to me. I think you live a damn fine lifestyle that I work 60 hours a week to support. So if anybody needs a vacation, it's not you. It's me. Well, all right then. Goodbye. Um, Judith's going to Hawaii for a week. So Jake's staying here? I'm shocked.
