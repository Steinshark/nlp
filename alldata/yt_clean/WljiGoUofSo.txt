<b>Hello friends, welcome to my kitchen.</b> <b>First, take a large bowl with 2 pounds or 900 grams of ground beef.</b> <b>Break 2 eggs into the bowl.</b> <b>Season with 1 teaspoon of salt.</b> <b>1 teaspoon of black pepper.</b> <b>And 1 teaspoon of paprika.</b> <b>Now, grate 1 onion.</b> <b>Friends, please write in the comments what country and city are you from? </b> <b>It's very nice to know that we can communicate all over the world! </b> <b>Add it into the bowl this will give the meat a lovely flavor and moisture.</b> <b>Then, finely chop a bunch of parsley.</b> <b>If you have any questions about the recipe, write to me and I will answer as soon as I see it in the comments!</b> <b>And add it to the mixture.</b> <b>Using your hands, mix everything together until well combined.</b> <b>You want to make sure all those seasonings and ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the meat.</b> <b>Friends, I'd be happy if you could give this video a like as it's the best reward from you.</b> <b>Next, place 5 medium potatoes in a saucepan.</b> <b>And fill it with water.</b> <b>Add 1 teaspoon of salt.</b> <b>Cover with a lid. And cook the potatoes over medium heat for about 30-40 minutes.</b> <b>Now, lay out a sheet of parchment paper on your work surface.</b> <b>Take the ground beef mixture and press it out into a square shape on the paper.</b> <b>This will be the base for our delicious stuffing.</b> <b>Friends, if you enjoy my content, subscribe to the channel to receive notifications about new similar recipes.</b> <b>In a frying pan, melt about a quarter stick of butter, which is 30 grams.</b> <b>Grate 2 cloves of garlic on a mini grater.</b> <b>And add them to the pan.</b> <b>Fry the garlic until it's fragrant.</b> <b>Then chop 5 ounces or 150 grams of spinach.</b> <b>Add it to the pan.</b> <b>Saute the spinach with the garlic until it's wilted and cooked through.</b> <b>Once the spinach is ready, spread it evenly over the ground beef.</b> <b>Then add a drizzle of olive oil into the pan.</b> <b>Finely chop 7 ounces or 200 grams of mushrooms.</b> <b>Saute them in the oil until they're golden and cooked through.</b> <b>Now, layer the cooked mushrooms over the spinach on the meat.</b> <b>Grate 5 ounces or 150 grams of Emmental cheese.</b> <b>Sprinkle it over the spinach and mushrooms.</b> <b>Now, carefully form the meat into a roll.</b> <b>Using the parchment paper to help guide it.</b> <b>Now, let's prepare the marinade.</b> <b>In a small bowl combine 2 tablespoons of ketchup.</b> <b>4 tablespoons of soy sauce.</b> <b>1 teaspoon of grain Dijon mustard.</b> <b>And 2 tablespoons of honey.</b> <b>Give it a good mix.</b> <b>Place the meat roll on a sheet of foil and brush it generously with the marinade.</b> <b>Wrap the roll in foil.</b> <b>And place it in the oven preheated to 360 degrees Fahrenheit or 180 degrees Celsius.</b> <b>Let it bake for 1 hour.</b> <b>While the meat is baking, check on your potatoes.</b> <b>They should be tender by now.</b> <b>To check, poke them with a knife.</b> <b>if it slides in easily, they're done!</b> <b>Drain the water and return the potatoes to the saucepan.</b> <b>2 fluid ounces or 60 milliliters of cream.</b> <b>And 1 ounce or 30 grams of grated Parmesan cheese.</b> <b>And 1 ounce or 30 grams of grated Parmesan cheese.</b> <b>The Parmesan will add a lovely depth of flavor to the potatoes.</b> <b>Mash everything together until you have a smooth, creamy mashed potato.</b> <b>Ten minutes before the roll is done, take it out of the oven, open the foil, and brush it with the remaining marinade.</b> <b>Put it back in the oven, uncovered, for another 10 minutes to let the top caramelize and become beautifully golden.</b> <b>Take the meat roll out of the oven.</b> <b>And slice it into thick pieces.</b> <b>Place a generous scoop of mashed potatoes on the plate.
