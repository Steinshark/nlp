[Mark Rober speaking] accuracy of this plane I built with Bard, and then we're gonna send it [upbeat music begins] When Google asked me to try out the latest version of Bard, [upbeat music fades out] I wanted to know if the advanced reasoning and multi-modal capabilities could master a very specific brand of slightly chaotic, educational In short, could Bard create than me, Mark Rober? [bell chimes] [lofi music begins] for an idea, but first we need to calibrate [keyboard clicking] science YouTuber? Come on, Bard. [Voice Of Bard] American YouTuber, engineer, - inventor and educator. [Mark Rober speaking] oh my gosh. Okay, down to business. Some ideas for a [keyboard clicking] [voice of Bard] The world's fastest [sound of ball being hit] [sound of balloon inflating] balloon pop and the most indestructible [detonation noise] [explosion sound] [no signal, TV sound] [Mark Rober speaking] long back and forth with Bard, it landed on, no pun intended, making the world's most Now I've been wanting to on my channel for a while, so getting Bard to just do it But an idea is nothing So I asked Bard for the story structure in a typical Mark Rober video. First step, design. [spray paint hiss] [voice of Bard] designs. Start by delving Paper airplane design is an artful blend of creativity [paper cutting sound] [voice of Mark Rober] I tried the Glider, the Concorde and the rather unusually named Canard. On to step two. [voice of Bard] [voice of Mark Rober] accuracy, wing configuration and how to test the accuracy of the three designs. [voice of Bard] [plastic cups falling] hoop shots, obstacle courses and the [dart hitting board] [voice of Mark Rober] the Concorde versus the Canard. Which of these will be the most accurate and why? [voice of Bard] is likely to be [Mark laughs] [Mark Rober speaking] I'm so sorry. [Mark Laughs] [voice of Bard] [Mark groans] also have potential for good - flight performance, but they may not be as [Mark victoriously shouting] [Mark Rober speaking] Aerogami. And yes, Bard taught me that word. Bard called it. It looks like the I wouldn't have guessed that. I would've thought Canard. But you know what? [spray paint hissing] winning design, it was time to take the next step. [voice of Bard] Sure, I can critique the [voice of Mark Rober] wings are too small, the tail is too small, and that I should use foam board instead. [music fades out] [voice of Bard] [voice of Mark Rober] Wow. Bard is challenging me, [sound of toy firing] [excited crowd shouting] It's time to call in the reinforcements. [lofi music begins] [voice of make the tail larger, By following these steps, and control of your airplane. [people laughing] [Mark Rober speaking] [voice of Bard] [Mark Rober speaking] visually appealing and engaging test environment would look like for a Mark Rober experiment, creating the world's &quot;Mark could use-&quot; [voice of Bard] Use a fog machine to sparklers to add a touch of... sparkle. Use small fireworks- [Mark Rober speaking] [lofi music ends] I love it. But then I asked Bard to come [upbeat music fades in] and eye-catching way to test the accuracy and for a YouTube video? [voice of Bard] a ring of fire. [Mark Rober speaking] [upbeat music] [metal grinding] [Mark shouting] [plane launching] [Mark laughing] 'Tis but a minor scratch. Oh boy, I have terrible news. Bard, I've got like a six-foot plane here and I'm trying to fly it and it kind of stalled out. Do you think it's true of hot air would lead that would cause my plane to stall? &quot;Yes, it is true that a could lead to lower air pressure, which could cause your plane to stall. Hot air is less dense than cold air.&quot; That actually makes sense. So it rises. &quot;This rising air creates a region That's like exactly what happened there. I think this actually helps. Keep our pressure at max, and then we're just gonna as opposed to like a high stall out. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Full power, baby. 1300, let's go! Three, two, one, hit it! Oh, that's the one! That's it! That's it! That's it! Yeah! Through the ring! Normally it takes like a to a final build like this. This only took us three Massive time saver for Incredible creative collaborator Okay, time to wrap this up. Actually, let's do it this way.
