Ozgur: There's bear poop here. Ozgur: Right behind us. Burcu: Those? Burcu: Oh, it's pretty big. Burcu: Looks great inside. Ozgur: These are lightweight as well. Burcu: The air's freezing up now. Burcu: It's getting cold. Ozgur: I'll warm it up right away. Burcu: Hand me one of those. Ozgur: Burcu. Burcu: Yeah? Burcu: Where? Ozgur: Look. Ozgur: But it's old. Ozgur: This should be enough for now. Ozgur: Fits perfectly. Burcu: Let it warm up a bit. I'm closing this up. Burcu: Look at how beautifully it's snowing. Ozgur: Melts as soon as it hits the ground. Ozgur: Your face is all red. Ozgur: Your cheeks... Burcu: It's beautiful. Burcu: Look at the snow falling. Burcu: Big, fluffy flakes coming down now. Burcu: So nice, right? Ozgur: Oh, what is that? Burcu: You shed the spores? Ozgur: It's rotted. They usually peel off the shells. Ozgur: Anyway, let's leave it here. Ozgur: See, there's more over there. Burcu: It's hot. Ozgur: Well, of course, it's sitting on top of the stove. Burcu: The snow is great. Ozgur: What's sage tea good for again? Burcu: It's calming. Burcu: Isn't calming a good thing? Burcu: Not that we need it right now to calm down. Ozgur: True. Just looking outside chills me out. Ozgur: Look how pretty the snow is. Ozgur: And it's nice and warm in here. Burcu: Looks like a painting out there. Ozgur: Nature itself is a masterpiece. Ozgur: I'll just... just five minutes. Burcu: Alright. Burcu: Ozgur, where's the ground meat? Ozgur: In the trunk. Burcu: Ozgur. Burcu: Get up, honey, food's almost ready. Ozgur: Alright. Ozgur: I feel better now. Ozgur: Smells amazing. Ozgur: Did you make all this while I was asleep? Ozgur: You're the best. Burcu: Let's add some cheese and let it sit five more minutes. Burcu: We can take these out. Ozgur: Yeah. Burcu: This table leg... Ozgur: Good now? Burcu: Pass me your plate. Burcu: The snow's great. Burcu: Just coming down in big flakes now. Ozgur: This is really delicious. Burcu: Enough salt? How's the salt? Ozgur: It's not something you can make at home, huh? Ozgur: Can you make this at home? Burcu: Want more rice? Burcu: Here you go. Burcu: Snow's so pretty. Burcu: This is so delicious. Burcu: That view looks like a TV screen, it's stunning. Burcu: Every hour it's a different kind of beauty. Burcu: Want some tangerine? Burcu: Put this on the stove to get rid of the food smell. Ozgur: You already did. Ozgur: Notice how the room smells different now? Burcu: Yeah. Food smell's gone. Burcu: Let's pick some flowers before bed. Ozgur: Alright. Burcu: Look at the sign. It's all speckled. Ozgur: Snow and cold. Ozgur: The forest is so beautiful, isn't it? Burcu: It really is. Burcu: This place... Burcu: So cold. Burcu: Feels like turning off the lights will never end. Ozgur: Goodnight. Ozgur: Good morning. Ozgur: You're up? Burcu: Dogs were barking all night. Burcu: I was so scared I barely slept. Ozgur: You should've called me. Ozgur: Aw, poor you. Ozgur: Were you scared of the dog? Burcu: No, of what the dog was barking at. Ozgur: Ugh, how can you be scared of something you don't even know? Ozgur: You're in top form this morning, give me five. Ozgur: What's the dog barking gonna do, anyway? Ozgur: It's all frozen solid. Ozgur: All frozen. Burcu: This might be the best camping lamp we've used yet. Ozgur: For sure. Ozgur: It's been burning for hours. Ozgur: Let me just do this so it melts a bit. Burcu: Come on, let's wash our faces. Burcu: This water should be good, right? Burcu: Feels a little warm. Burcu: Let's add some cold water then. Burcu: I'm making a healthy pizza. Burcu: Would've been great to find mushrooms, though. Burcu: Under the snow, huh? Burcu: Looks good. Burcu: Yeah, really good. Burcu: I added hot peppers since you like spice. Burcu: Look at the steam rising. Burcu: That's ice, not snow. Ozgur: Frozen from the cold. Ozgur: It'll melt in ten minutes.
