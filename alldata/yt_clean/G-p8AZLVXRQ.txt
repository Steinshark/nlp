&lt;i&gt;In memory of Meral Okay...&lt;/i&gt; She is a spy. A traitor who sneaked in among us. Your Majesty... Your Majesty. I told you You're now where you belong to. Under my feet.. I've fallen for love, This is such a love that... ...it'll prove my innocence to His Majesty. With all those lies... ....what innocence are you talking about? No one can save you now. Because tonight, not only your,... ...all my enemies' fates have changed. Your Grace! Ibrahim? -Forgive me, Your Grace. -His Majesty summons you immediately. I wasn't informed, Your Grace. Your Majesty. Firuze. Do you know anything about her? Of course, I do. I know everyone about Then tell me who she is. -Your Majest, forgive me-- How did she get in my palace? Hayreddin Barbarossa Pasha took her She was presented to She was born in Rery, I know these things, too! How do we know it's the truth? How do we know And maybe a dynast? -How could this be? How could a Safavid Dynasty member... ...enter my harem and my chamber? This is impossible, Your Majesty. She didn't deny it, Ibrahim! It's clear that this is the truth! Investigate who she is at once! What is her plan? I want to know what she's done, Now! Your Grace. Finally, you came. Who are you woman? I've heard that you're Is that true? Speak! Obviously, you were sent here to spy on us. Who is helping you? I'll tell everything. I'm all ears. Not to you, Your Grace. I'll talk only to His Majesty. I won't talk to anyone else. Because only he will understand me. Only he will listen to me. This is impossible. You will never see His Majesty again. Then kill me. I'll be buried with my secrets. -What is going on? It's about Firuze Hatun. All the aghas are in her room. Sultana Hurrem put her in the dungeons. Shut up! You're yapping again! Sumbul Agha, she really a spy? Well, she is. She exposed everything that's Oh my goodness! Oh my... Oh my... Since you protect her all this time, No, of course not, Your Highness... Oh my... You'll lose your head... Wa ash-hadu anna... Welcome, Your Highness, What is this, Hurrem? A new game? I would get worried too if I were you. If we... ...consider how you ...the situation What does this mean? You put that viper So, Your Highness... ...you risked... ...the dynasty's future to defeat me. If you have a finger... ...in this again Hurrem,... ...you should know that Your Highness,... ...what if I don't Who'll pay the price then? Your Majesty. As you requested, But she won't talk. She says she'll only talk to you. -Where is she? ...but I brought her here, Obviously, she has an explanation. You wait outside too, Ibrahim -You searched her properly, right? Your Majesty... I've been told Then start with your name. My name... ...is real just as my feelings are. I am... ...Firuze Begumhan. I'm a Sultana of the Safavid dynasty. Shah Tahmasb's father... ...and my father are brothers. It's impossible for me Because no ruler would think... ...a woman from his dynasty deserves this. Then why did you come here? I told you before,... ...my fate brought me here. Shah Tahmasb was not in He saw him as a threat for his throne. One night... One night, my father woke us up suddenly. My mother,... ...my sisters,... ...many people from Tahmasb was after us. We were on the road for days. Then... ...we got on a boat. They caught us after a short while. They sinked the boat. Everyone died. But I was on Barbossa's boat Ibrahim! Your Highness, you shouldn't have I don't think Firuze Right? This must be Hurrem's scheme. Unfortunately, this is no scheme. What's been said This is impossible She's been in the harem for years. She spent many times alone If she was a spy, It depends on why she's here. Maybe she didn't have ...her duty is only to carry information. What have I done, Ibrahim? -I, myself-- Maybe she gave up on everything But, no matter what, ...she'll be beheaded. I'll do it myself. I had no other choice. If it was exposed who I was,... ...I would be turned in the dynasty. Or I would be used against them. That's why I hid my identity Then,... ...I had to keep quiet for my love. Or I was going to lose you. I know the rules. It's forbidden... ...for a muslim to get in She has to get married. How could I tell you this while ...of an enemy dynasty? You lied to me, Firuze. You lied to my face... ...countless times. Now, you expect me May the God Almighty... be my witness, If my heart was not full of your love,... ...I would come to you, ...I would talk to you and ask for help. But... ...I was afraid. I was afraid of losing you. You asked me who I was. I am... ...a miserable woman... ...who's struck by Until this day,... ...I always accepted my fate. I never tried to stop it. It tossed me around like a wind. And finally, it brought me to you. I kneed before you. I've become happy in your paradise. I will... I will never... ...object to my fate which gave me... ...your merciful hands. Whatever you say,... ...whatever you command,... I will accept it. If you like,... ...take my life right here. I am ready to accept anything. Aghas. His Majesty commanded that Shame on you. I trusted you. I believed you. Now, I see Hurrem was right. You sneaked in among us like a viper. -Your Highness-- Take her away, Come in. Your Highness. Come, Fatma. My Suleyman... My strong grandson... How is his health? Thak God, he is fine. He is also appetent. But he becomes a bit restless at nights. My Mustafa was the same. He is still stubborn, though. He has to do it What happened, Mother Sultana? That Helena or whatever... She tempted him. Mustafa instructed How could this be? You know how conscientious he is. He probably pities her But this wedding won't be any good. Will you allow this? The Prince wants that. He doesn't listen to me anyway. There's nothing I can do now. Your Highness. You know about His Majesty's When the situation is this,... ...I advice you to I will write a letter and Forgive me, but there's If I could foresee this matter ...I would prevent you from the beginning. Send the woman away. I can't kick Helena -Forget that. Her every need will be provided. And you can visit her in appropriate times. Don't think about this matter. I'll do what's needed. You tell me about Abbas Agha. Why couldn't you find him yet? Let me go! Let me go! Look at her. She's smiling, happy. She will marry a prince. Of course, she will be happy. -Why didn't you tell me before? The Prince made his decision. What am I going to do now, Fidan? If I were you, Yes, but I have a son now. I have to think about him. I can't put both my son You're right. But if she gets married with him now, What will you do then? She already had The Prince in her pocket. I won't be surprised Your Highness. Come, Fidan. What happened? As you said, she came to me straight away. You should have seen her, She'll do whatever Good. Don't forget Fidan Hatun. No matter what happens, Mustafa shouldn't Don't worry, Your Highness. Everything will be as you command. So, you're blinded enough Is that so? No one can insult me. Not a prince,... ...even if you were the sultan Who even cares about your filthy existance? Did you think you could run away my sword? -My brother almost died because of you. You will all crap out someday. Firuze is locked up I don't understand Ibrahim Pasha is She won't be executed Anyway. About your appointment, Sultana Hatice She used Nigar as an excuse. As you see, you have to go,... ...there's nothing we can do. As you see appropriate. Rustem Agha. This expatriation You'll return here more powerful. How much time do you have? Pasha gave me a month. Good. We should get rid of Firuze first. Ibrahim Pasha will have his turn, too. Your Majesty. Good morning. Good morning to you, too. Come. Could you learn anything? I personally talked to people who The woman is telling the truth, Her father is Sheik Seyyid Ibrahim, He was in important positions He's known the be close He wanted to set him up the throne. Naturally, the swords were drawn... ....and Shiek Seyid Ibrahim However,... But they were murdered They think that Firuze is dead, too -So, she's not a spy. It is obvious that she kept silent Because... ...she will be killed. What would you like me to do, Your Majesty? Get up woman, we're leaving. Are you going to kill me? Mother. I came to see Cihangir I took a walk the garden. I've heard about Firuze. I just can't understand. It turns out she had big secrets. Don't take that demon's name again,... ...Mihrimah. Take her away. Your Highness. What's going on, Afife Hatun? What is that woman doing here? His Majesty's command. He commanded Firuze ...to favorites ward. Come in. Your Majest, Sultana Hurrem is here. Let her in. Suleyman. Yes, Hurrem. But be quick. Because I am really busy. What does this meman? How could Firuze be back I deemed it appropriate. It has been determined How? Is she going to move on I haven't made a decision about her yet. Suleyman,... She is a muslim woman. It is not appropriate What are you going to do? Will you marry her,... ...so she can stay in the harem? You'll learn with everyone This decision ...Suleyman,... ...but also ours. Please, Suleyman, don't forget that. Fatma Hatun. Are you ready? -This will end tonight. What will I do then? And what would Sultana Mahidevran think? I organized everything. Gulizar will help you. We will solve that Helena will come here.

I wish you were competent like her. Your Highness. Sumbul, tell me, Has His Makesty made his decision? Your Highness,... Sultana, Firuze Hatun As what Afife Hatun told me,... ...His Majesty summoned her. I'm thinking that the decision Finally. Your Highness... It's clear that she is no spy.

If it's true love,... ....there will no winners in it,... ...there will be no victory. Because love... ...belongs to the losers. It continues to burn All losers console themselves I'm really curious,... ...what would you say I'm sure you would taunt me with your cry of victory, wouldn't you? I'm its very self And His Majesty's decision If you remember, we made a deal. If I lose,... ...I'm ready to drink this poison. What about you, Firuze? Can you drink it? You should have no doubt.

We need to be cautious. I don't want Firuze There is an easy way, Your Highness. She is from the Safavid dynasty. I will send a message to some people. There will surely be someone Rustem Agha, you read my mind. They won't let her live in this case. She will be executed for sure. Rustem, the price of betrayal is heavy.
