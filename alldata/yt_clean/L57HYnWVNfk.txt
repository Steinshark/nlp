- So I've been a therapist for 33 years, and I really do understand But I also have a great what you don't understand. You certainly can't heal So what I'm going to do with you today is I'm going to take you first through the rules of the mind. They're my rules of the but I made them up over 33 years. And somebody said to me once, &quot;Well, who are you to make this up?&quot; I went, &quot;Well someone's got to do it.&quot; I think 33 years of working with royalty and Olympic athletes &quot;These are the rules of the mind.&quot; And if ever you're stuck with stuck with an adult that needs some help, and you think, oh, I take them through the rules of the mind 'cause it actually blows their mind. They go, &quot;Well, I never knew that. &quot;I didn't understand that.&quot; And we will come out of to language patterns. Now I've given you some that are really for young children, but they also are very So let's do a quick little I want you to close your I'm going to try to remember I'm going to try so hard to memorize it. If only I could memorize that document. I wish I had a better memory. I hope I can remember that when I'm working with my own client. I really hope I can do what she does. I wish I could do it. I hope to do it, and I try to do it. I really want to do it. And just focus on how you feel which is wishy washy. I don't like &quot;wish&quot;. Wishing says to your mind, you haven't got a prayer, 'Cause wishing just says, Oh, I wish. No one says I wish I could and clean my teeth. I wish I could pick up that You don't say wish, So when you say to the It says, &quot;Yeah, me too. &quot;Get over it.&quot; When you say to the mind, &quot;I It goes, &quot;Yeah well keep hoping, &quot;'cause you're not going to do that.&quot; When you go, &quot;If only&quot;, your mind goes, &quot;Well you've So keep on with the &quot;if But when you do it differently, close your eyes again and It's going in. I have a phenomenal memory. My memory is awesome. I read things and they I am remembering it all. I do this. I've got it. I have a phenomenal memory. I have incredible powers And I remember everything. It has a totally different effect. And so you learn with language. I never let my clients say &quot;wish&quot;. I won't allow them to say the word, &quot;but&quot;. I could do that, but. No, we never say, &quot;but&quot;. And we also never say &quot;should&quot;. My therapist said to &quot;Should is shit. &quot;And never use that word.&quot; I should. I say &quot;I could&quot;. I should go to the gym. I could go to the gym, I'm not making the effort. So with young children, just changing one word I'll give you an example. My little girl would go to and she'd come back and I'd always say, &quot;What have you remembered?&quot; Could have said, &quot;What There's only two words. What have you remembered? She goes, &quot;I've remembered &quot;I remembered my book. &quot;I remembered my PE gear.&quot; I go, &quot;That's fantastic.&quot; You have such a great memory you remember, and back you come. And very quickly, she because I never said, &quot;What have you forgotten today?&quot; Oh my God. Your mind is like a sieve. What's wrong with you? You get to the gate, and I never do that. And you forget, why can't you be like me? I have my little bag by the door. I have everything the night before. And I never did that. I said, &quot;What have you remembered?&quot; So here's just one word. And my clients really taught 'Cause I'd see them &quot;I wish I could do that.&quot; Oh thanks, Marisa for all this advice. I could do that, but. I know I ought to do And so I started banning words. I said, &quot;When you come in this office, &quot;you are not allowed I work a lot with infertile women, and the ones who don't get &quot;I wish I could get pregnant.&quot; And then when they get &quot;I'm so scared of losing it. &quot;I'm not going to tell anyone I'm like, &quot;Well, but what It's in the womb, the most I'm not even going to 'cause I have no faith How about sending the and showing them and &quot;It's staying. &quot;My body made it. &quot;My body is so super smart. &quot;My body's going to carry This is my one chance I'm making a miracle here. And my body is growing And I'm growing and nurturing And every day I tell it, &quot;This week, your mouth &quot;and your ears are forming.&quot; And it sends a message this is working. Whereas running to the bathroom every hour to just see if you're spotting, saying, &quot;Oh I'm really scared of losing it.&quot; Sends a message to the mind. And one of the rules of the is that every thought you forms a blueprint, and your mind must work to make that blueprint real. So when you say, &quot;I I'd lose the eyes in the back of my head if they weren't fixed in there, 'cause I just can't remember anything. Your mind goes, that's a blueprint. Let me take you to it. And when you say, &quot;My In fact, I'm like human Google. When I read an exam, the my mind has already gone to work, found the answer, and it stays in my head right through until I Then I read the next question. The same thing happens. As I read the question, Google I work with children all and they come in. I worked with a little I think there were 17 children applied for every place in his school. And he flunked the mocks and I'm like, &quot;Darling, you're supposed &quot;It's great to flunk the mocks.&quot; You know what mocks are, don't you? Oh, so in England, when you have a mock exam, maybe six weeks before you take the exam just to see how you do. And then they say, &quot;You did really well. &quot;And 'cause you did really well, &quot;you're going to pass that exam. &quot;And 'cause you did terribly, In fact, the ones who do well in the mocks get so complacent, they often don't do so And the ones who do badly think, &quot;Wow, I need to up my game. &quot;I need to revise more and study more.&quot; So when he came in and said, &quot;My mommy was so upset &quot;in the mocks.&quot; I went, &quot;That's fantastic.&quot; What were you worse on? He said, &quot;This writing.&quot; And what did you do? I didn't read the instructions correctly and I didn't use the right words. I went, &quot;That's fantastic.&quot; In fact, what I do is, his name is Isaac. If along my website, marisapeer.com, I will put that video working with a small child using language. Just go to marisapeer.com. We'll put that up in a couple of days. And so I said, &quot;That's fantastic. &quot;So what did you need to do?&quot; And just by changing his language, I didn't use the right words, and explained to him that he could do it, and telling him that his Then I was asking him some And I said, &quot;How do &quot;Have you studied Harry Potter?&quot; He went, &quot;No, I just really like it.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, see how So when you're working &quot;I don't know&quot;, ask them about James Bond, ask them about something &quot;How do you know this?&quot; They go, &quot;I don't know.&quot; How'd you know? Wow, you're so smart. Because when they like And part of school is liking some things. So with this little kid, I knew he'd get in. 'Cause he came in like He was like, &quot;I'm going to nail this. &quot;I know what to do. &quot;My mind is like Google.&quot; And I will say to all my clients, whether they're a seven or someone taking a I say, whatever you're reading, You say the word &quot;narrow down&quot;. And when you say &quot;narrow You're absorbed in that paper. You have phenomenal powers of recall, retention, and assimilation. And I say words that Comprehension, compretension, retention, recall, assimilation. I say it over and over again because the mind believes So let's go through the rules of the mind. Here is the first one. What is expected, tends to be realized. When you say to a child, &quot;I don't know what's wrong with you. &quot;Your brother was in my class &quot;Why can't you learn? &quot;Why can't you sit still? &quot;Why are you so disruptive? &quot;What is wrong with you?&quot; You're making words that And exactly the same for adults. I'm referring this a lot to children, but for the therapist here, those children come in as your clients. But it's just the same for adult. If your boss says to And you go, &quot;Oh my God, I'm &quot;And I'm going to have to rush it. &quot;I haven't got enough time to prepare. &quot;I know I'm going to get it wrong. &quot;I'm going to go on stage, &quot;And look like a complete retard.&quot; Well, when you say that, And here's one of my The mind responds to So in America they were called &quot;Don't do drugs&quot;. And as they sharpened them, And they said, &quot;Do drugs&quot;. Not very smart. Needed to put that the other way around. What is expected tends to be realized. When a child is doing and the mother goes, &quot;You're going to break your leg. &quot;Oh my God. &quot;You're going to break your ankle.&quot; You can make that happen. And when you say to the child, &quot;Now I know you're climbing the tree. &quot;Look where you're putting your hands, &quot;look where you're going &quot;Focus on what you're doing.&quot; That will be realized. So in powerful language, you can never say, &quot;You're going to fall. &quot;You're going to mess that up. &quot;You're going to ruin everything.&quot; That's just not going to work out. You have to say the opposite. Okay, I've only got 10 I only need 10 minutes. I've only got 10 minutes to get there. That's exactly how much time I need. And if I'm late, I wasn't I have a belief now when it's 'cause I wasn't I know longer am &quot;Oh my God, I'm so late. &quot;This is going to be terrible.&quot; In fact, I was recently to get a train, to work and we got stuck in traffic. And so I was playing a game with it. Oh my God, I'm going to miss the train. This is terrible. I'm going to ruin my reputation. The team are going to be so And then I started to say, &quot;The &quot;It doesn't matter. &quot;What's 20 minutes? &quot;My material's so great. &quot;They have lots of time off.&quot; Well they finished and it was fine. So all the way there, I was playing a game and I but they really wouldn't have minded. But I could have ruined my day, made myself panicky and sweaty, by going, &quot;Oh my God, I haven't got enough time. &quot;And now it's all ruined.&quot; And it's never ruined. You can come back from anything. And then I worked with and had to go into the MRI scanner. And every time I saw him he's like, &quot;I can't, I can't do it. &quot;I can't get in that scanner.&quot; Why not? He said, &quot;Well, I feel &quot;I feel like as a premonition of my death, &quot;and I get in this scanner, &quot;and I'm going to die.&quot; And he said, &quot;Well, I freak out. &quot;I press the button, I have to come out.&quot; And they keep saying, &quot;I can't, I can't even be Which is not true. He was like, &quot;I can't do He probably was in I said, &quot;Look, the words &quot;in that scanner, &quot;this is a premonition of my death. &quot;I feel like I'm in a coffin. &quot;I feel like I'm suffocating That's a blueprint. And your mind doesn't like those words. So how about these words? How about saying, &quot;I'm in my bed at home &quot;and I'm just so chilled and &quot;I'm chilled. &quot;I'm relaxed. &quot;I'm blissed out.&quot; You must use words that make a picture. You can't go, &quot;Oh, I'm okay really. &quot;I'm quite good. &quot;I'm not bad. &quot;This is okay.&quot; 'Cause when I say the what's the picture? There's no picture. It's what I call fluff. When you say &quot;I'm chilled. &quot;I'm blissed out. &quot;I'm ecstatic. &quot;I'm just lying here and &quot;It's just so cool.&quot; The mind goes, &quot;You're right.&quot; And when you go, &quot;I'm in a and the mind goes, &quot;You're right.&quot; See, here's the great thing. You can choose any words you like. You can go, &quot;Well, we're &quot;And this half's going to be positive.&quot; That's your choice. You know what you can't choose? What you do to yourself when you say, &quot;I'm an idiot. &quot;I'm a moron. &quot;I'm a retard. &quot;I've got rocks for brains. &quot;Everything goes wrong. &quot;Who would ever liked me? &quot;I've got cellulite. &quot;I'm a single parent. &quot;I've got no chance.&quot; Blah, blah, blah. &quot;I didn't go to college, &quot;so I couldn't possibly do what you do.&quot; I got kicked out of college by the way. So you can definitely do what I do. And it was the best thing I can look at my life and say, &quot;Being fired, being dumped, and &quot;Thank you God for putting that up to me &quot;because it changed my life. &quot;It was the best thing. &quot;Rejection has been one of the best things &quot;that ever happened to me. Being the least favorite kid, if I could have my life again, I'd go back and be the least &quot;I'm going to show my And if I was the favorite, I would've had a totally different life. So with my client, I was saying, you know, these words So he got in the scanner, And he said that when he came out, all the nurses and doctors came in and gave him a standing ovation. He said it was more powerful because he felt so good. Some years later I had to go in a scanner. I thought, &quot;Well, I'm just I love playing with words. So I lay there and I was going, &quot;I'm so chilled. &quot;This is so good.&quot; How many of us has said, &quot;I'd Well here I am, 20 minutes to myself. I can lie here and do nothing. No one's going, &quot;Can you proof this copy? &quot;Can you answer this email? &quot;Can you speak to this client.&quot; My daughter's going, &quot;Mommy, my boiler's &quot;Can you come over right now and fix it?&quot; I had 20 minutes to &quot;I'm so chilled.&quot; And then I thought, So as I go, &quot;I'm in a coffin. &quot;I got claustrophobia. &quot;I feel like I'm trapped. And all the buzzers went off and I didn't even know I was moving. And then they speak to me like, &quot;Marisa, you have to lie completely still. &quot;Stop moving.&quot; So I had to go back into, &quot;I'm chilled. &quot;I'm ecstatic. &quot;I'm blissed out.&quot; And I love doing that. And it's a really good Instead of, &quot;I'm late. &quot;I've ruined everything.&quot; I have all the time I need. You see, you have a choice. Every day you get to choose You know what you don't get to choose? What you do to your body when you say, &quot;I'm an idiot. &quot;I knew I'd mess that up. &quot;I knew that relationship wouldn't work. &quot;I've been waiting for it to go wrong. &quot;In fact, the day we got married, &quot;I stuck stickers on all my stuff &quot;so that when we got divorced, &quot;I was already planning the miscarriage. &quot;I didn't buy anything for my baby.&quot; I mean, who does that? Lots of people, apparently. They're all my clients. And they plan for stuff to go wrong. They say, &quot;I sent my kid &quot;Don't worry, you're &quot;Here's a credit card so you &quot;in a week's time.&quot; They plan it. And you don't want to plan it. You want to ban it. So words are really powerful. You can choose to be negative or positive. That's your choice, but you cannot choose when you use negative language. So the first rule of the mind, what you expect is realized. Who thinks that's true? So here's my advice to you. Expect amazing things then. If what is expected tends to be realized, expect the best, expect love, and success, and an amazing life. 'Cause you know what? It will probably be realized really fast if you expect it. Imagination is more when dealing with your own If I said to any of you, &quot;Come Who would come and stand on this chair? I'll give you a hundred Sure. If I said, &quot;Well, now the chair &quot;is on top of that spire &quot;on the highest building in Tallinn.&quot; Who's going to climb up and stand on it for a hundred dollars? Who would do that? Some people would 'cause They go, &quot;If I can stand And most people go, &quot;No I could fall.&quot; If I had a little tiny plank up here, you can walk the plank Put the plank between Who's going to walk it? Not many people, because the imagination that you could fall and kill yourself is way more powerful than the knowledge that I did this on the ground. It's wide enough. Fear of flying. Knowledge says it's actually The most dangerous part of a flight is actually the drive to the airport. That's way more dangerous Do you think the imagination cares? We're going in a flying coffin. I'm hurtling through the air, and that guy looks like he's and he's in the bar, I think he's going to blow up the plane. And then you feel terrible. The other person's going I've always wanted to This is so great. Here's my time again, to do nothing. So whatever you imagine will defeat logic, will defeat knowledge. And when dealing with children, people do logical- why are you so bad? Why can't you get it? What's going on? Why are you so naughty? And that doesn't work. I never say to kids, &quot;Why are you bad?&quot; I go, &quot;What happened to you?&quot; Was working with little kid recently who always played up before lunch and would get hysterical after every meal. And I'd actually been in And I'd seen that a lot, the kids start weeping uncontrollably because they don't know when And they go, &quot;Look, &quot;It's fine. &quot;We have food. &quot;You'll be fed three times a day.&quot; It takes about two years for as they remove the plates because the emotion is, So this little boy was and he'd been to three different schools. And one of the teachers &quot;When does he do it?&quot; Well he always does it before meals. And I said, &quot;You should &quot;but what happened to him?&quot; And then the mother came in and said, &quot;Well, I adopted him at one. &quot;He was born to crackheads.&quot; And he used to cry when I left the room. And when I read his notes, his parents would leave and he didn't get fed very much. And so he's got this And I said, &quot;Well, you And of course you can't &quot;Look, you're going to You have to go, &quot;Look, &quot;They're really sad. &quot;But mommy is going to &quot;And you're always going And you can't do it logically because feeling is more The feeling you're going to die on a plane will always wipe out the logic that this is the safest way to travel. One of my clients said, &quot;Please help me.&quot; She said, &quot;I've done the logic. &quot;I went to British Airways flying course. &quot;I walked into the cockpit wearing shorts &quot;and I lost control of my &quot;Now I'm even more scared about flying &quot;because this was a &quot;They were logically &quot;When they said they were taking off, &quot;I had a terrible accident. &quot;I knew it was bad 'cause &quot;and I had to be taken off that plane. &quot;And now I'm even further 'Cause logic doesn't work. Emotion does. And so I would talk to her and say, &quot;You know, you have to &quot;You have to say, when you're &quot;Oh my God, flying thrills me. &quot;It elates me. &quot;It empowers me. &quot;It delights me. &quot;I love flying.&quot; Your mind goes, &quot;You're right.&quot; And when you go, &quot;I'm going &quot;to smithereens.&quot; Your mind goes, &quot;You're right.&quot; Because here's another rule of the mind. It does not care if good or bad, true or false, healthy or unhealthy. Just let's it in. So let me show you. You put your hand in front of your mouth. You may have done this Put your hand in front of your mouth like you're about to eat. Close your eyes and imagine you have a big, fat, juicy, I want you to breathe in that gorgeous, gorgeous lemon smell. I want you to squish that Open your mouth. Still with your eyes closed, shove that lemon in your mouth and eat it. I want you to bite the Suck out the flesh, suck out the lemon. Start chewing it, eating, eat that whole entire half of a lemon. Keep going, keep sucking, And open your eyes. And put your hand up if you made saliva. So here's a question for you. Where was the lemon? Where was it? Say that again? Yeah people say there wasn't one. Oh, there was, there It was in your imagination. You know there's no lemon. You go, &quot;What's going on here? &quot;I know there's no lemon. &quot;Why am I pumping out &quot;What am I doing that for? &quot;I know it's not there.&quot; But your mind believes it. The mind will believe Tell it great things. Don't use wishy washy. I hope, I try, maybe, who knows? You know, I took, I had He was very ill. And I took him to see a doctor, and the doctor got out the notes and went, &quot;Hmm, I'll try to make you better. &quot;I do the very best.&quot; I said, &quot;This is not the doctor for you.&quot; He's like, &quot;Look, this is my illness.&quot; I'm like, &quot;I know. &quot;But I'm a therapist, &quot;It's our job. &quot;It's our calling.&quot; So you cannot go to an &quot;I will try. &quot;And I hope this works. &quot;And if it doesn't, we'll 'Cause it's filling So I'm very lucky. I'm in the book in London for I'm not a doctor, I'm a therapist. But they very nicely put me in there. Very happy about that 'cause I can speak to I said to some doctors, They went, &quot;Roger Kirby&quot; So I called Kirby and said, &quot;Look, we're in the same book. &quot;I have this friend with cancer.&quot; He said, &quot;Oh, that's &quot;Bring him in.&quot; I brought him in. And when he said, &quot;Dean, He went, &quot;Well, I happen to be &quot;for your problem. &quot;And I will fix it. &quot;You will be fine. &quot;You'll still be here when you're 75.&quot; Which one do you think he liked? And he did say, &quot;Well, He went, &quot;Who is he?&quot; He went, &quot;Oh, I trained him. &quot;He's not as good as me.&quot; He went, &quot;Right, I'm going to Because the words, &quot;I am the &quot;You're in good hands&quot;, &quot;I will save you&quot;, &quot;I will cure you&quot;. We're allowed to say that in the UK. I will make you better. Very different to, &quot;Well I'll try.&quot; We have this new drug, it could work. If it doesn't, there's something else. We can only hope. I mean, that puts fear, we can only hope. Let's try. Don't do that. This is amazing. This is awesome. This is phenomenal. I use the same words all the time when I'm teaching my students, You are elated. You are empowered. You are thrilled. You're delighted. This is awesome. This is amazing. When I make clients, they &quot;Where did you get those words?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Well, I find &quot;and I flipped them over.&quot; I'm useless. I'm spectacular. I'm terrified. I'm delighted. And by the way, fear and You can be on a FunFair screaming &quot;Oh look at that.&quot; Are they scared or excited? I don't know. Do you? 'Cause it's the same. When you're excited, you scream. And when you're scared, you scream. So wherever you're and you will feel excited, or go, &quot;I'm terrified&quot; We done in the battle Emotion always wins. Your mind does what it This is probably one of the Here's your mind's job. It's got a very clear job. I'm your mind, and I'm going And when you say, &quot;Oh, &quot;My boss makes me want to die. &quot;My kids are making me go up the wall. &quot;I am stressed out of Your mind goes, &quot;Oh, you keep telling me that &quot;It appears to be your &quot;Why don't I just give you a lovely ulcer? &quot;And then you can stay at &quot;that's killing you.&quot; It's that's its job. Why don't you do your job The commute is a pain, but I I have stuff to do. My boss is difficult with everyone. It's not me. He's not there when I'm He's not in the room when This is temporary. He's an unhappy person. Do it better. You will get what you want what you want. But here come the words. Let's imagine you're And the words are, &quot;Oh &quot;I'm terrified. &quot;I'm going to go bright red, &quot;I haven't got the time right. &quot;I'm so nervous.&quot; Your mind goes, &quot;Do not get on that stage. &quot;If you walk to that stage, &quot;I'm going to give you a massive panic &quot;in the middle of the room, &quot;because you told me &quot;and I've got to do what you want.&quot; Or you can go, &quot;I am &quot;I've got something to say. &quot;People like me. What I have to say is of value. &quot;Speaking to a stage &quot;is like speaking to my wife or husband.&quot; And then your mind goes, &quot;Get You always have a choice, but your mind's job is to When you go, I want a week off. Who's ever done this? What I would give for a Your mind goes, &quot;Leave that with me. &quot;Now you got the flu. &quot;How cool am I? I listened to you. &quot;You wanted a week off lying &quot;Now you got it.&quot; That's not what you wanted. You need to say, &quot;I need some time. &quot;And I'm like a battery, &quot;And I'm okay at working &quot;'cause at weekends, I Now your mind understands. But saying, &quot;I'd give anything &quot;not to have chair that meeting.&quot; Your mind goes, &quot;How about &quot;I can bring that for you. &quot;You don't want to chair that meeting. &quot;You said, I'd do anything not to go. &quot;I'd rather kill myself &quot;than give that presentation to my boss.&quot; Your mind goes, &quot;Oh don't kill yourself. &quot;I'll just give you a &quot;Now you can't even leave the bathroom. &quot;There's no chance &quot;Done what you wanted.&quot; I know I'm making it funny, but it is funny that so your mind's job is to do And it bases that on one thing. The words you use, and the and here's some great news, you can change those words like that. And when you do that, So your mind tries to away from pain and towards pleasure too. Varied, I mean, so many kids are going, &quot;I want to ask out this girl. &quot;I want to talk to that &quot;They won't like me. &quot;And they're going to And if they keep doing that, &quot;No, don't go there. &quot;Stay the way you are.&quot; So you have to say, &quot;People like me. &quot;I'm a great kid.&quot; I get all my young kids &quot;I'm an awesome kid. &quot;I'm enough.&quot; And it really changes them I'm an awesome kid. I can talk to a girl, like And then they feel okay, but if you keep linking &quot;Don't go there. &quot;Don't go there.&quot; And if you link pleasure to it, you go there because you're I've got to work on my website all weekend and all my friends are in the bar. So I can link pain to that. It's not fair. It's not fair that I've got when I could be in the pub. Now your mind's going to go, &quot;I think you should tidy &quot;Make sure all your &quot;then plump up the cushions 'Cause it's very clear, you do not want to work on your website, but oh boy, getting those is really compelling. Who's done that? Most of us do that. I suddenly need to do the laundry, which I don't even like. I'm tidying up my house 'cause I'm saying I don't want How about saying, &quot;It thrills &quot;I'm elated working on my website. &quot;There is nowhere I'd rather &quot;than sitting in my office, Your mind goes, &quot;I'm going &quot;You're going to be doing &quot;You told me you love it. &quot;And it thrills you. &quot;Let me fill you up with I'm a writer. I know how this works. I never go, &quot;Oh my God, &quot;It's so lonely. &quot;It's so isolating. &quot;And what if no one liked it? &quot;What if it goes on Amazon, and they go, &quot;I hate that book. &quot;And it gets no stars.&quot; Or I can go, &quot;I love writing. &quot;How cool is it? &quot;I get to write and &quot;and they like them. &quot;And they give me great reviews.&quot; 'Cause there's a choice going on again. So whatever you want, you must link massive And you can link pain But I don't bother to do that. Let's think of all the pain. Your books never published. You go into your coffin. It's still in a drawer. You don't have to do that. Just focus on the pleasure bit. I'm a writer. It's amazing. My book is published. I used to always imagine I'd imagine going to an airport, And when I did, it was like, wow. But your mind went, &quot;'cause you showed me very &quot;I had that image to take you to.&quot; 'Cause what you want, wants you. And what you are moving Don't move towards fear. Don't move towards failure. Don't move towards it going wrong, move towards it going right. So we've actually done the next bit. Your mind responds to The fastest way to change anything is to change the pictures and words. And it's such an easy thing to do. I'm terrified. I'm elated. I'm useless. I'm amazing. I have no memory. My memory is compelling. I can't speak to people. What I have to say is easy. I find it easy to speak to anyone. This is the most vexing rule of the mind for every therapist and coach in the room. It's the one my clients Your mind loves what is familiar. If your mind could choose, it will stay with what's familiar and never go to what's unfamiliar. We're in a walled city. And that's interesting they shut the door, and We didn't think, &quot;Do you know, I feel like &quot;I think I'll wander. &quot;I'm a bit bored of being &quot;I want some variety. &quot;I think I'll open the gate, &quot;wander off and find another tribe.&quot; They might've killed you or eaten you. We learnt familiar made us safe. Who here notices it with their kids? They literally want the same cup, the same bowl, the same cereal. I took my daughter to She watched The Little Mermaid And she didn't, that was okay in Finnish 'cause she knew she'd watched &quot;Babe, here's Father Christmas.&quot; She's like, &quot;Mommy, I want It's like, well next and watch a movie then. She did actually get into it, but it made her feel good. She used to play this game. She had so many Barbies, and and he always picked the same one. He never picked another because they like familiar. It makes them safe. You know how many kids you have? They want the same story every night. But familiar also makes us safe. So here's a rule of the mind. And it's a very important My mind likes what is familiar and it doesn't like But I can make anything and anything positive familiar. Let's start with praise. It's the most simple, I meet clients who were never praised. I met one girl whose dad said, &quot;You're so rubbish. &quot;Just like your mother. &quot;God knows what you've got going. &quot;If any man asks you out, &quot;snap them up because you are nothing. &quot;You're not interesting. &quot;You're not attractive. &quot;When you get pregnant, you &quot;and be a big fat mess. &quot;So if anyone wants to be with you, &quot;I can't imagine why. &quot;Take them.&quot; And she heard that a lot. So she had this interesting belief. I've got nothing to offer the world. And I did a lot of work with her, and she went out, and she went, &quot;Was just amazing, it was like magic. &quot;This guy came up and he asked me out, &quot;and he was so nice to me and &quot;And he picked me up in his &quot;Told me I was amazing. &quot;I'm never seeing him again.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Really?&quot; She went, &quot;No. &quot;No, he was too good for me.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Oh, let's change that wording, &quot;to his behavior was so unfamiliar. &quot;I don't recognize praise or nice. &quot;As somebody believing &quot;and I want to run back to the familiar. &quot;Guys I have to beg to take me out. &quot;Or seeing my friends, I pay the bill, &quot;and they remind me of my dad.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Well, guess what? &quot;You're not supposed to &quot;So there's a clue. &quot;If someone is like your dad, &quot;I don't need think you should be &quot;getting into bed with them. &quot;And I think you need to make it unfair. &quot;People like it when you make them laugh.&quot; So she went, &quot;Right.&quot; So I said, &quot;You need to &quot;And this is what you do. &quot;You keep saying, I will He rings me when he says he He texts me. I'll make it familiar. I will make it familiar. And she ended up marrying him. She's very happy. She said, &quot;How weird, &quot;and said, &quot;What happened to me?&quot; She went &quot;What? &quot;The guy who never called me? &quot;You never called me So you have to say, let's How many of you find How many you've found praising yourself even more unfamiliar? Okay, so if you're never praised and you're criticized a lot, and criticism is familiar &quot;Wow, I love that teacher.&quot; You go, &quot;I got it free. &quot;It's got a hole in it. &quot;I've had it eight years.&quot; I loved your speech. Didn't you notice I No, I thought it was amazing. I hear you're the best Yeah, but not in my county. There's another guy way better than me. So if praise isn't familiar, but you'll add in what's So one of the best things you can do that will change your life, is to make praising yourself familiar, and to make criticism unfamiliar. Don't do that and go, &quot;Oh, there's a stain on this jacket. &quot;I'm an idiot. &quot;Oh, I didn't buy any nice food. &quot;Now I'm going to have to eat donuts. &quot;I'm such a moron. &quot;I didn't charge my phone. &quot;I'm a retard. &quot;I haven't got enough time to get there. &quot;I'm a loser.&quot; You know, if someone's &quot;It's not very good. &quot;Look at that, you haven't Then all the way home they went, &quot;You haven't left enough time. &quot;You're an idiot. &quot;You haven't got any nice food. &quot;Moron.&quot; How quickly would you kick Pretty fast. But when it's you, you And, when a friend is mean, you go, &quot;They're having a bad day.&quot; But when you're mean, your mind goes, &quot;Well, it must be true. &quot;Everything you tell me is true.&quot; So you need to make praise familiar. It's really easy. I'm amazing. I'm kind. I'm nice. I'm real. I'm authentic. I'm a good person. I have something to offer the world. I have a unique skill. That's easy. And don't go, &quot;I'm an idiot. &quot;I'm a moron.&quot; I was telling my little girl off one day. She goes, &quot;Mommy, you are a silly billy.&quot; I thought, what was a great word. So next time I'm about I go, &quot;You silly billy.&quot; 'Cause it's just a word. If I said to my husband, He doesn't go, &quot;How could 'Cause it's a word. It's how I say it. You're so naughty. He doesn't go, &quot;I know, &quot;I'm so bad.&quot; I go, &quot;Oh that's, you're so bad.&quot; So you can make words. So I want you to think of the worst word you have for yourself. It's always the same &quot;idiot&quot;, &quot;loser&quot;. And I want you to change Because when you say silly I was changing a light and I nearly electrocuted. And I was about to go, And I went, &quot;You silly billy. &quot;Don't do that again.&quot; Because why beat yourself up? There's enough people in the world who'd like to beat you up. Why do you want to be one of them? Be nice. Show the world that you're worth it. So up praise massively If you wanted to change your life today, this will change your life. Praise yourself a lot. And don't criticize yourself. And if you do go, &quot;Yeah, I Go, &quot;Well I learnt. &quot;I learnt from that mistake, If it taught you something, it's okay. Don't beat yourself up. You're allowed to make a mistake. You are not allowed to beat yourself up, berate yourself, and call yourself names, and punish your body for doing what everyone does. They make mistakes. So to make a mistake is human. And to forgive yourself is really divine. And to call yourself a silly So that's something I Whatever you focus on you get more of. How many of you sat &quot;Oh my God, that needle's You know, just the babies don't do that 'cause they don't know. So whenever I have to have blood taken, I get my phone out and I get completely, and I go ahead, and I But if I look at it, it's not the same. If you focus on pain, it hurts. If you focus on stress, In fact, I had a client come and she was like this. She was shaking so much, my husband's like, &quot;Wow, &quot;out of that, but I've never And she was just shaking so much. I'm like, &quot;Okay, I want you to shake more. &quot;I want you to really shake. &quot;Come on Gwen. &quot;You can do better than that. &quot;Shake keeps shaking, shaking, shaking.&quot; I said, &quot;You know, if you've &quot;by a lion, when it gets &quot;I need therapy now, It shakes. It stands and shakes, and it goes back to the And when I made her shake, what was happening is she began to think, &quot;Oh, I'm in control of the shaking. &quot;I'm doing it. &quot;Then I can stop it.&quot; And so when clients go, &quot;My knees are knocking.&quot; I go, &quot;Knock them together louder &quot;I want to hear it.&quot; My hands are clammy. Can you make them even more clammy? Can you turn up that Yeah, go on then. And then I say, &quot;You see &quot;What you focus on you get more of.&quot; When they focus on it, oh, I did that? And I can turn it down. It feels better. So don't be scared of or start to laugh. When they laugh, I go, &quot;I &quot;I want you to almost wet Actually I don't say that too often because that does put a bad picture, good picture in the mind. When people to say laugh more Sometimes I cry with them. Whatever you focus on, you get more of. If you ski and you focus, you'll go. If you're on the freeway and you focus on an exit hard enough, you'll take it without even planning to. So whatever you focus on, you get more of. Focus on great things, and The strongest force in every is that we must act in a way that utterly matches and with our thinking. I know I'm going to fail. I know I'm going to mess it up. I know it's going to hurt. I know it will go wrong. Now you have zero choice that's consistent with your thinking. I know it's going to be great. I know I'm going to sail through it. I can ace this. This is easy. Change the words. It changes your whole language, but everything starts with a thought. Everything, everything, And here's the great news. Your thoughts are yours to change. And you can change your thoughts. It's actually incredibly easy when you learn that everything A thought is a word. And if you use words, elated, empowered, ecstatic, blissed out. Amazing, phenomenal, I'm just amazing. And you can repeat the same I feel ecstatic. I'm elated. When I work, they always say, &quot;I can't tell my mom that she's &quot;in the whole world who ruined my life.&quot; I go, &quot;Well, how about thinking it?&quot; If you say that it makes you feel elated. It makes you empowered. It sets it free. Because outrage is just I said, &quot;Listen, your anger is like gas. &quot;Better out than in. &quot;She's not in the room. &quot;Let's do it now. &quot;I want you to say to your mom. &quot;Mom, you know, I want to love you more. &quot;And I can't 'cause I resent deep.&quot; And suddenly they go, &quot;You absolute bitch! &quot;You biggest bitch in the world. &quot;How could you do that?&quot; And they're like, &quot;I feel so &quot;Now I can go home and &quot;'cause I've let the resentment out.&quot; So I never tell people to keep it in. I think feelings do the most when they're repressed and pushed down. And most of my clients who are pushing down feelings. The stomach is the seat of all emotions. You can't heal what you can't feel. But you should let feelings out. And if you keep it in, you always suffer. You always feel repressed. Many clients I see who are not depressed. They are repressed and they are suppressed because they can't say, &quot;I resent you for always &quot;I resent you for marrying &quot;who were hideous to me and And then they make their You have to be aware of it. You have to accept it. And you have to articulate it. I call it triple A. Be aware of your feelings. My ex-husband drives me crazy And I can't tell him 'cause I get that. Shut the bathroom, turn &quot;You are the biggest ass in the world.&quot; Thank God I've got a great ass. 'Cause I realized I don't and make it funny. God gave me a great ass. I don't need to marry one. I'm done with you. But say it. And then you feel better, So don't think, &quot;Oh I feel terrible.&quot; She said, I can say, &quot;I don't need to date one.&quot; And now I feel good. I remember that. They remember stuff that's So remember your thoughts What you present to your mind it will present back to you, and you go, &quot;I'm not enough.&quot; It goes, &quot;Of course.&quot; And when you go, &quot;I am enough.&quot; It goes, &quot;Of course.&quot; So we've already covered this rule that your mind doesn't care. We've covered every thought you think. Here's a great rule. When dealing with a subconscious mind, the greater the conscious effort, the less the subconscious responds. Who's tried to relax? Who's tried to sleep? Who's tried to remember, what's I don't know. And suddenly they're &quot;Oh my God. &quot;It's just popped in my head.&quot; Your mind actually is like Google. If you need to remember, don't go, &quot;Where's my keys? &quot;Where's my keys? &quot;And my passport? &quot;Oh my God. &quot;I'm going to miss the plane. &quot;I'm going to get fired. &quot;It's all a disaster.&quot; Don't do that. Say to your mind, &quot;Tell &quot;Remind where my keys are.&quot; And do something else, &quot;Oh, of course I came in, &quot;and I put them next to the fridge.&quot; Tell me the name of that Do something else. Your mind will do its job. You give it an instruction. Mind, go ahead and tell where my wallet is. And it will tell you. It will pop it in your head. But when you try and start, you know the thing where you and then you go and empty it out again. And now you've emptied out three times looking for your passport. You know it's not there, let's tip our handbag on the I'm missing the flight. Oh my God. Everyone's going to hate me. My kids are going to be furious. Don't do that. Stress shuts down logical thinking. When you're stressed, your mind goes, &quot;There must be a lion somewhere.&quot; Let me pull all the blood into your heart and lungs so you can run. I saw this in action years ago. I was walking home and I lived in a basement and I and I knew that he was going And I got my key in the door I thought, I've lived I don't know how to open the door. So I was so scared, to pull the key out, and I had flatten myself against the wall. And he came halfway down. He couldn't see me and he left. But I wasn't going to keep because when you're scared, You can't even remember So you have to fill up and pump it around, push and then you're not stressed. But it's very important. When you want to remember Ask your mind to remind you. You're in fear in exam, and you think, &quot;Oh my God, my mind's gone blank.&quot; Fill up your mouth with saliva, swirl it around, push your shoulders down. And your mind goes, &quot;A wet mouth is a sign of That's why we kiss, by the A wet mouth makes you relaxed. And so don't do that. I can't remember. I don't know where I'm going. I'm lost on the freeway. Oh my God, which road shall I take? I'm just panicking. Fill up your mouth with saliva and say, &quot;Subconscious mind, remind me.&quot; I looked at the map, which road is it? It will tell you because it's foolproof, but you've got to do it too. Your mind works for you. You don't work, put it to work. If you had a PA, and went, &quot;Okay I'm going out now. &quot;Just do the job.&quot; Or, &quot;Hey, I'm going out to Tallinn. &quot;Could you decorate my house?&quot; Do you think you're going to come back and they've done it right? No. You've got to go, &quot;This The more specific you are, PA, or hairdresser, the You don't go to a restaurant and go, &quot;Oh get me something to eat.&quot; I didn't want that. Well you say anything will do. You got to talk to your mind that way too. So I think we pretty much got that. The mind can't hold conflicting beliefs. So let's go onto hypnotic We have just enough time. Children can only work They don't understand tomorrow. My little girl said, &quot;Mommy, She didn't know what yesterday, She'll go, &quot;Is it tomorrow now? &quot;Is it tonight today?&quot; Because they don't understand. They only understand now. That's why with a baby, they think you're never coming back. And so children aren't really Children can own your respond The more vivid the picture, So don't say you're a good kid. Say you are an amazing kid. What I love about you, is you've got a natural gift for science, or what I love about you is What I love about you is It doesn't matter if you You love learning. The more you can make the picture good. See, I have so many kids who are twins. They go, &quot;I always get called twins.&quot; Twins, lunches is ready. Twins, get in the car. And they had no identity. Don't do that. Don't dress your kids the same. Don't say &quot;I love you 'Cause when you label a child, you limit them. Even a good label. I love you 'cause you're beautiful. Kids say, &quot;And if I wasn't, you wouldn't. &quot;Don't do that.&quot; I love you because you're lovable. And when you grow up, people are going to love you. One of my clients said, &quot;My daddy said to me everyday, &quot;no one's ever going Well, there's a program. You say to your kids, &quot;You're so lovable. &quot;You're going to find so &quot;like I love you.&quot; So a child's mind, doesn't How many people say to And then they touch. 'Cause don't is a new- Touch, they know what touch is. Don't touch. Keep touching it. They can only hear the You can say that's very fragile. And it's very important to mommy. As I say to my little girl, when you're walking across I didn't, don't spill it. Don't, oh look, you've spilled it now. I knew it. You always spill it. I go, &quot;Darling when you look at, &quot;you got to look at the &quot;And if you look at &quot;you'll keep it upright, &quot;and then everything will stay in the cup. They understand stuff Don't spill your juice. I guarantee they're going to &quot;You just can't stop spilling it. &quot;You're just a messy kid.&quot; Unfortunately they go, &quot;I'm so messy. &quot;I'm always spilling stuff. &quot;What's wrong with me?&quot; You were conditioned, that's but you can be unconditioned like that. So a child mind responds better to specific words and instructions. So they don't understand later. They do respond to positive words. You must with children, You're bad. You're naughty. Good kids do bad things. Smart people do silly things. Say to a child, &quot;You're a great kid. &quot;Why did you do that? &quot;That's not you. &quot;You're a good kid.&quot; And they go, &quot;Well, you said No I didn't. Well, I heard that. And so if you start with you, Our kids push our buttons. I say, &quot;No, you might teacher, darling.&quot; &quot;You're teaching me And she gets paint all over the carpet. My daughter's an artist. I'm tidy. She's messy. I wasn't designed to give birth to myself. How boring would that have been? She's nothing like me. I'm nothing like her. We learn from each other. It didn't make our life So children also respond to, &quot;you are&quot;, &quot;you can&quot;, You all know the story about the class that were given to a teacher and the teacher to we predict that- and you are the genius teacher. We've done these secret test. Genius kids, genius teacher. We know you'll get genius results, which of course they did. And they went &quot;Well, &quot;and we picked the kids at random.&quot; But if you believe So let's go onto the very last one. Children can't future pace. So when they're feeling sadness, it feels like it's going to And they do this thing called tagging. I can't make my mommy happy and it's always going to be this way. I don't have a dad. I don't have anyone to love me. It will never, ever change. We don't have enough money. It's going to be like this And so when you're working with children, I say to them something which I love. I say, &quot;Look darling, &quot;It's not your life. &quot;I know your dad's an alcoholic. &quot;I know your dad's in jail. &quot;I know your mom's working all the time, &quot;and you live with babysitters, &quot;and I know that is your life &quot;One day you'll have a They're not good at future pacing. But that one expression, You have no friends. I mean, I worked for a little girl who had no friends and was so bullied. And now this girl has got so many friends, 'cause I would always say, &quot;Remember, it's just your life today, &quot;and probably tomorrow next week.&quot; And I taught her not to want friends. 'Cause when you have a little &quot;Please like me&quot;, kids don't like that. They like, &quot;I like me. &quot;If you want to like me too, good, &quot;if you don't, your loss.&quot; And I taught her to do that. Change her energy. She was inundated with friends. But they really respond to that word. And because children can't future pace. That's like when you're below kids think she's not coming. When you say, &quot;Oh my child's so greedy. &quot;I want it to wait to eat.&quot; They feel that they're because they cannot future pace. And so when you're a therapist or a coach, when people say, &quot;You &quot;I mainline jelly beans. &quot;What's wrong with me?&quot; Somewhere, somehow their parents Or remove food as a punishment. You don't have that because you're bad. Or we can't afford that. And because the child's they act as if it's forever, So the job of the child's mind is just the same as the adult mind, it does what it thinks I don't want to go to school. I'm scared of school. And now I've got all and hives, and eczema. I would have the little kid &quot;Darling, I know this is a crazy question. &quot;But if the eczema had a He said, &quot;Well, when I stand like that &quot;and mommy puts the wet He called it his sensible skin. Couldn't say sensitive. He said, &quot;When she puts the &quot;shouldn't put any cream on that baby.&quot; And there it was. He told his mind as the mother did. I want that. I want massage. I worked with another kid Very unusual. That if the migraine was your friend, I know that's crazy, isn't it? But he wanted to help you with, mommy and daddy stopped shouting. They turn off the light until it goes away. So he'd obviously said to his mind, &quot;I wish I could stop my parents fighting.&quot; And the mind goes, &quot;Let me come up with a solution. &quot;It may be crazy. &quot;It may be harmful, &quot;but the mind doesn't, just It doesn't think, is it good, bad, helpful, unhelpful, beneficial. It's just a solution. So children tag onto these painful issues, of painful experiences, and you can change it by It'll always be this way. It will never change. It'll be like this for You can help them incredibly. And I'm talking about adults, &quot;Look, I know I'm a millionaire, &quot;I'm so worried it's going to run out.&quot; Because when they're a kid, They didn't have is that So I think we're just about out of time. But since we're talking about it, I'm going to tell you a very So I work with a lot of children, and there's nothing better. One little kid said to me, &quot;Marisa, you are the magic person, &quot;and you stop me wetting the bed. &quot;'Cause you did magic.&quot; But all I did was tell her that when her tummy was full of wee wee, can't say bladder, that went up to her brain and she woke up, and she sat up, and she And then the next day she &quot;Grandmother, I'm dry.&quot; And then she went to sleepovers. I excited her imagination. I did it several times. In 20 minutes, that kid And she said, &quot;You did magic with me.&quot; Then I worked with another kid who said, &quot;Marisa, you're so cool. &quot;You do magic.&quot; And then I worked with &quot;You're the bollocks.&quot; And I thought, isn't that interesting that the words for a man's genitals, are a massive compliment. For women, it's a massive insult. So, there's your language patterns. Being the bollocks is a huge compliment. And being the female So you have to make of words But if you use powerful words, If you understand the rules of the mind, and put them into practice, Your mind is like a Ferrari. And you're like a driver the subconscious is the Ferrari, the conscious is a driver. Don't even know how to run this.
