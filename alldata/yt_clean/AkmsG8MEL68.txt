Quick, this way. Caption: Front.Live. Forest. Episode II Kid! There are energy drinks here, remember? Be careful of them... Where? In these bags that I'm going to give you now. Caption: Infantry. Kid, can you move it over there? I just got here as soon as I could. I was going to come later, but we have a bunch of incoming calls, a bunch of tasks, and everything is so messy. I only came with children's champagne, according to the old Azov New Year tradition. Guys, I won't tell you how hard the year was and how bravely you fought in many situations. For the last 4-5 months we have been in the Kreminna sector, and before that -- in the Zaporizhzhya sector. You really know, and this is seen in the battalion, brigade, and Ukraine as a whole, what tigers and beasts you are, what you did during the assault, stabilization and defense actions. Guys, you are awesome, but unfortunately, you have to realize that the next year will not be easier. It will be much harder, and how it will go depends on us, on our preparedness, on our motivation and on our strength: both physical and moral. So, guys, I wish you all the best of luck in the New Year, I wish you all good health and, most importantly, strength. With your strength, you will be able to get everything you need. If you need anything, just take it by force, as they say. Here's the champagne. I think &quot;Khizhak&quot; will divide it up, so that half of it goes to the firing positions, and half to the guys here. Well, guys, I won't keep you, happy New Year. Dismissed, go ahead. &quot;Khizhak&quot;, take the &quot;Khizhak&quot;. We're leaving, we're leaving. Happy New Year, happy New year! Wow, wow! Be careful, bro, there are energy drinks there. Happy New year! Wish you luck! Be careful, bro, there are energy drinks there. The label on the box: UAV, Sviat. Caption: Celebrating the New Year with children's champagne is a long-standing tradition of the unit We need to get these... Of course we will, bro. &quot;Khizhak&quot;, maybe you know it. To the up-co-ming year! Guys, look. Hold the champagne somehow so it doesn't break. Look over there, don't put anything on top of the boxes. Caption: Artillery. Plus, I've got it. Okay, you can go back to sleep. What do you have there? Oh, nothing. I made some salads, but everything is fine. These firecrackers are going off as if heavy artillery hasn't stopped since yesterday morning. I see. Our New Year's Eve is going to be loud too. Well, okay, let's go. I'll call you back in the New Year. Okay. Bye. These were my parents. They are now internally displaced persons from the temporarily occupied territory of Zaporizhzhia region. They went to Germany. My sister, also an IDP, and her family are there. And my family, my daughter and wife, are in Poland. They are also IDPs. They are waiting for the victory to come back. We need to recharge the batteries. Basically, we perform combat work with the engine turned off. In order to compensate for the battery discharge, we periodically start the engine and charge the battery. Caption: Infantry. There are forty meters, okay? I look, &quot;Alarm&quot; is coming. I say: &quot;Where?&quot; So I look at it, and the light goes off: &quot;Pow, pow, pow&quot;. I'm like, &quot;bang&quot; there. That's it. The light went out. I have a guy with an M113... He went to the &quot;***&quot;, he came. He was wounded on the &quot;***&quot;. &quot;Rapira&quot;, is that a girl? Yes. Are you not being harassed here? Who knows. He got a piece of shrapnel in the sternum... Drop. Yeah, a drop. Hello, &quot;Laslo&quot;, it's ***. A hundred meters away, I saw the f***er behind the tree shooting. There is a hill there. Behind the hill? It's a stupid hill. It's a total b****tch. You can't see anything over there. I don't have thirteen. I have sixteenth through twenty-seventh, and then it drops 32, 31, 32. Plus, we're leaving now. The first group? Who's going? We are going. And who is going in the first group? As for GDP, we're behind, so we're doing everything we can. Earlier, only two KABs flew in for two days, but yesterday, from eight to twelve o'clock, almost 20 KABs landed. This is for one position only. Is that it? Is everyone ready? Bye! We can wait for three. There won't be room. Old man, do you have a red one? Caption: Mortar. It caught fire behind you. Let's go check where it landed. Somewhere close. Come here, come here, okay, okay. F***ing cheese in the dust, n***ing mouth, f***ing c***s, c***s, you c***s, you f***ing cheese, you f***ing delicious cheese. I'm telling you, they're going to add more today. Let's go check it out. Which one? Did this one get torn up? It was torn up. Caption: Artillery. Ten. Take it. I have counted it. Let's unpack it. They brought the 795th, high-explosive incendiary. We fired them this morning. We did a good job. The most important thing is that it was effective. That's why we are replenishing our stocks. What will you do when the war is over? Live in peace. I really hope so. Raise a child, marriage is not far away, the wedding is coming up. So I think everything will be fine. We will rebuild the country and live peacefully. The video is just top, it's just... Oh, you mean... Yes, of course, nothing has changed yet. When they give me an answer, I'll let you know. What have you prepared for yourself? Anyway, I get it. You've cooked something, you want to send it to me, you're threatening me. These threats: &quot;I'll send you everything.&quot; I know you will. Caption: Infantry. I'll take that one. Hello? &quot;Mason&quot;, &quot;Mason&quot;, give the phone to the senior &quot;***&quot;. Here, just twist it. Hello, &quot;Donbass&quot;? &quot;Mason&quot; is on the line. Yes, yes. Hello. Yes, I hear you. I said we've arrived at &quot;***&quot;. To &quot;***&quot;, yes. I got it. Yeah. That's it, plus, accepted. Plus, plus. In three days, it feels like the field was prepared for some kind of sowing. I came out one day and didn't recognize it. My dugout was on fire, and this one had moved about 20 centimeters. Hey, listen, kid. Come on. We have our own here. Also, bring all the junk out of &quot;***&quot; and &quot;***&quot;: camouflage nets, just bags, ammunition. There is &quot;Rekfus&quot; at the station, he knows where the ammunition is. You, accordingly, will have to bring this ammunition to your position and use it in case of emergency. Quick. This way. Come here! Who is the senior among you? Me. &quot;Minato&quot;? Yes. Where's the radio they gave you? A &quot;Bird&quot;. [UAV] Yes. Come here. I have a rifle and a backpack there. Ugh, it's hot as f**k. I think there are drops here. Did you have a safe trip? It was fine. What kind of work did you do? We made an observation post. Did you finish it? In principle, yes. Almost. Now I'll show you everything. &quot;***&quot;, &quot;***&quot;, &quot;***&quot;, &quot;***&quot;, over. &quot;***&quot;, &quot;***&quot;, &quot;***&quot;, &quot;***&quot;, come in. Over. You asked us to get in touch with you. All right, plus, checking communications. Plus plus. I'm showing you how it was. I'm showing you how it is now. Look at this. It was like this. Before you went up, right? I understand. Now look how it is. Well, today it was just a little bit sprinkled. Here's the observation post. And then there's a log. Oh, f***, it's still lying here. Yeah, it needs to be pulled out. Wait, it wasn't there that time. When we changed you, it wasn't there. It wasn't there? You were changing us. This is the observation post. This is closed with a mattress, right? Yes. The sacks are laid down. Okay, I understand. Now the &quot;bird&quot; is leaving, you can go. Look: they are changing now... Did they tell you how the rotation is going now? Well, tell me. Look, we also ordered nails, ties, and candles here, and there's a bag. We know. We just didn't bring it all. I understand. Everything is here. The ties are right there. Be careful, go ahead, special forces. How long did you stand there? Caption: Artillery. About 20 minutes. 10 minutes ago they told us to come. How much more time do you need to unload? Almost all of it. My favorite godfather, happy New Year. Come back home. I love you, kisses. Ksenia. Monkey. Who's that? My goddaughter. Caption: Company stronghold. It's all good here. Congratulations. Oh, &quot;Gorchik&quot; f**k. Are they cooking dinner for me? Enough for you, I think. Is the road okay? All callers to &quot;***&quot;. &quot;***&quot; at low altitude. Anyway, what's the point... They are**** they start around eight in the morning, until fourteen. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, 25 was hit periodically. You know, 82 [82-mm mortar]... You go in. For example, you dug in there, you can already walk tilted. You go in and have to crawl on your knees again. There is no other way. How is the left loophole, is it okay or not? We restored it. We laid it out with bags again. It is more or less normal. The right one is also normal. We made a little mound there again. Come on, be careful here. There was a tree that fell over there. Roughly speaking, that's it. But if it's here, then everything is flying too. Three this time. The fourth one is in reserve. They put the fourth one in the NZ [inviolable reserve]. Yeah, you won't sleep, I get it. It's just a little bit of a jolt. I don't know what you do, it still shakes. It's less now. What, is it flying? I don't know. I have no idea. Well, maybe I'll slice it, and you can spread it. Let me do the slicing. 25th, 25th, 2, 4, and did you hear the shooting? That's the observation post, the one on the far left. That's where they throw the bombs. Caption: Infantry. They like to throw there. Even when there is no one there, They throw it there. So be careful there. It hovers somewhere, goes up and waits. Then it goes down sharply and drops. Night vision is good? What`s the trick? Minato, what we have to do with this radio? Caption: Artillery. Zelensky: We don`t know what New year will bring to us. Whatever it brings, we will be stronger. Now I want to say words that were considered trivial before the war, but during the war... Internet. &quot;Tourist&quot;. &quot;Tourist&quot;, run the f**k away. &quot;Tourist&quot;, don't give up. Take him outside without a jacket. Caption: Mortars. Oh, it's a holiday. Happy New Year! Now, now. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, zero. Attention, attention! To all &quot;***&quot; listeners. Happy New Year, my bubbly, and happy holidays! Caption: Infantry. Firing! Caption. Fire! F**k it! Shot fired! Glory to the Azov! Plus, plus, plus. Happy New Year. &quot;Redis&quot;: It's already zero. Happy New Year, gentlemen!
