so this will be the nerdiest thing I do, and I hope you hang in there, it gets pretty nerdy, but I was trying to logically figure out how to have a happy marriage, so I went back to when I designed computers, this is to be called logic map and you design a computer, the way it thinks is using AND gates and OR gates, it's called Boolean logic. Like, for there's an AND gate, which says there's two inputs, A and B and when both inputs are true, the output's true. A and B both have to be true, so if either input is false, the output is false, right? Then there's an OR gate, says if A or B is true, the output's true. Right? So if either one's true, the output's true and only when they're both false is the output false. How does this get funny? Please get to it quickly. (audience laughing) I figured out the happiness logic map. Okay, here we go. The happy-- there's two inputs, me, and my wife, Laura. Don and Laura. We'll start with the most easy case. Don is wrong, and Laura is right. The ladies are saying it, Laura is right. I have no problem there. She's right? It's right. This is where it gets complicated. If we're both right, Laura's right and again, I have no problem with that, 'cause she's right, so, okay, okay, I'll give it to her, that's fine. Here's where it really gets messy. If I'm right and she's wrong, doesn't happen often, now and then, doesn't matter, I would rather be happy than right, so Laura's right and then the hardest one, if we're both wrong, Don is wrong. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) If you're single, get out your phone, take a picture of this right now. (audience laughing) This took me 20 years to figure out. I'm sharing it with you now. Now a lot of times when I got in trouble or I made my wife upset, it's 'cause I was trying to help. I was watching her vacuum one day and clearly she did not have a plan. (audience laughing) She went that way, and that way, she went over the same spot like seven times (audience laughing) and as I sat there on the couch, which might've been the problem now that I think about it. (audience laughing) I said, you know, honey, there's a more efficient way to vacuum. If you went around the room like a Zamboni at an ice rink, you wouldn't go over the same spot every time, and it would be more efficient, and you'd have more free time. I'm trying to help you out, it's more efficient. She said, &quot;You know Don, &quot;that is more efficient. &quot;Wanna know why? &quot;'Cause you're gonna be &quot;doing it from now on.&quot; (audience laughing) And I do the vacuuming and I think I do it better. I think I won that argument, (audience laughing) but I'm not allowed to say it, so there you go. Now my wife and I, you know opposites attract. It's amazing, she's intuitive and spontaneous, I'm logical and structured and with financial, it's the same way. Almost every couple, one person's a saver, one person's a spender. In our relationship, I'm the saver, and my wife is a spender, and we're both very good at what we do, (audience laughing) so we recently got, like, a distant relative died and left us $6,000 out of the blue, so we each budgeted it, and I said to my wife, Here's how I'd like to spend it. I'm a guy, but I want to spend, so I want to get a QLED TV, 85 inch, big TV, right? And that's $4799 and then I'm going to save the rest, $1,201. That was my plan. She looked at this, and amazing to me, she goes, &quot;That's all you're going to save?&quot; And I'm like, what do you mean? She goes, &quot;I got a much &quot;better plan than that,&quot; I went, I got excited, I'm like, we're gonna save more? Tell me more! She goes, &quot;Well, first of all, &quot;forget about your TV for now. &quot;What we really need is a new couch, &quot;a new coffee table, and a new rug, &quot;'cause the other ones are &quot;almost five years old, &quot;they're out of style.&quot; I'm like, ugh! She goes, &quot;I can get the couch for $2,900, &quot;I can get the coffee table, $999, &quot;and the rug for $1999.&quot; And I quickly added it in my head and I said, Well, that's $5997. I added it in my head and that's only $3 in savings. She goes, &quot;What are you talking about? &quot;It's way more savings than that.&quot; Said how do you figure it? She goes, &quot;Well, first of all, &quot;that's the sale price. &quot;The actual price of the couch, &quot;which is $4499, I save $1500. &quot;The coffee table, that was $1699, &quot;I saved another $700 there. &quot;The rug I got for--look at it, &quot;$2,000 off of the rug &quot;for a total savings of $4,200!&quot; (audience laughing) Wait, she went on, &quot;I'm now going to take that $4,200 &quot;that I just saved, &quot;buy that television, which I found &quot;on sale, saving another $800 &quot;for a total savings of $5,000.&quot; (audience laughing) (audience laughing) I'm like, honey, you are so hot right now! (audience laughing) How did you do that? One thing she's upset with me, is I won't go shopping with her anymore. I can't, I'm older, and I can't keep up, I get cramps, I get weak and she goes, &quot;Well you just don't want &quot;to hang out with me.&quot; I said, no, I just, I don't shop like you. She goes, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; I go, when I shop, I don't shop the same way. She goes, &quot;Well, how do you shop?&quot; I said, I'll show you. I got a GPS tracking device. Here's how I shop, and then I tracked her, so I need a pair of pants, here's how I shop. Here's how Don shops. I walk in the mall, take a left, take a right, buy some pants, take a left, take a right and go home. (audience laughing) It takes me six minutes and costs me $33. I am done shopping for 2020. I got my cargo pants, I'm ready to go. (audience laughing) Same thing. Laura needs to go shopping. She needs a pair of pants. Here's how Laura does it. she walks in the mall, there she is right there. (audience laughing) Three hours, 26 minutes, $876, (audience laughing) so my wife's telling me do this pitch, she goes, you're not asking yourself the right question, mister. Ask yourself, who's the more efficient shopper, Mr. Smarty Cargo Pants. Let's do the analysis. You, Don, you spent $33 in six minutes. That's a cost per minute of $5.50 per minute. I, Laura, spent $876 in 206 minutes. That's $4.25, I kicked your butt. (audience laughing) I love it when you talk nerdy to me, honey. Talk nerdy to me! (audience laughing) And then finally, there's a lot of keys to a happy marriage. This, I believe is one of the many keys, but if you can get this to happen, it's really going to be a good one. Two things need to line up, your spouse's looks here, and your vision over there, need to decay at exactly the same rate. (audience laughing) That is a beautiful thing. Come on. Come on! (audience applauding) You'll both look the same to each other your whole lives! You can always be like, I can look right at my wife and say, Honey, you're as beautiful as the day I met ya. I'm sorry, you're over there? You're as beautiful as the day I met ya.
