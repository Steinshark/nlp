You're pretty convinced that you can win I went through a lot of trouble for you to- I will definitely win. I've been flying for a thousand hours I'm not going to lose. Don't you want to move on from There are associations for Eh- Kuramochi. You should go to Germany. Because of Iruma, the I'll get you a ticket right away. From now on, your opponent There's so much dust... When was the last time Can't you shut up while cleaning... But... What's this? Huh? A notebook? Ah, that's where it was!

Eh?! &lt;i&gt;The telephone number you have Nope, he cancelled his contract... No way... Eh- isn't this all way too sudden... Out of the way. With Sorachi-senpai and I haven't really been motivated recently... Even though he said he'd win How did the Aonagi aviation club What's up, Tsurutama? There were plenty of thermals I'm sorry. For some I know that feeling. Let's switch over. Sure. That car... Asahina-san! What brings you here today? What brings me here? Sure, but... Kuramochi-san isn't here anymore, so... That Kuramochi asked me. To take care of Aonagi. Uh, excuse me... I'm Tsuru, first year. I heard what you were talking about before. Uh... is there anything you might Are you the first-year Yes. What was that flight earlier. No wonder Kuramochi I sent him to Germany. There's nothing left Eh? But Kuramochi-san said we were going If you have to rely on Kuramochi to win... there's no way you'll win at all. Just so you know, the reason I came here Observe us? I've come to invest in talents I have no intention to support an Aonagi that But... earlier, you said that You. What are you to Kuramochi? Eh? Did you fall in love with him? If so, you should be honest about that- That's not the case. Are you trying to bully us? Why would you betray I'm not betraying anyone. Tsurutama, what are you doing?! But... Asahina-san, we apologise. Don't worry about it. My connection to Kuramochi is simple. He is indebted to me. In return for purchasing Kuramochi became mine. It looks like some idiot I was the one who broke it. I've been taking responsibility- I don't care about that. I'm going to come clean. There have been several times where Kuramochi I told him to find a replacement for him But in the end, he couldn't find one. About that... couldn't I be the one? Hey! What are you saying?! Can you do it? If you're saying that, I'll take you if you become First off, to take part get a certificate of competency. I'll get you ready for that. What's a "certificate of competency"? Shhh!

They need someone like me to be angry at. Private number I'm coming! Hello, Tsuru here. &lt;i&gt;It's been a while.&lt;/i&gt; Eh? Kuramochi-san?! I heard from Asahina-san. I'm sorry.

Tsurutama! Everyone's here to cheer for you! Sorachi-senpai, it's been a while You came running for Tsurutama in the end! It was Nanba-san who called me! &lt;i&gt;You guys hear about Aonagi?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Yeah.&lt;/i&gt; Looks like Kuramochi's gone. It's over for Aonagi. &lt;i&gt;True that!&lt;/i&gt; What's up with those guys, deliberately Every time I see you they become Ah! Hatori! You're gonna fight with us as well? For the Onma people, you need to Toumaki, your insulting If you're angry, defeat me in your glider! Thank you, Hatori. Don't worry about it. It's not a real contest if they Same goes for us!

Ah, w-wait- What? What's with you? I said I'm sorry That's not what I mean, are you stupid? Kuramochi crashed- Everyone can hear you! Earlier, when Asahina-san was talking As I thought. Uh- it wasn't on purpose... That's enough. I was going to tell you What exactly happened? During his training in Germany, it appears that Kuramochi's A corpse has yet to be found. But... that means his Yeah! In any case. Don't cause unnecessary unrest. Got it? Shit... &lt;i&gt;Menuma runway, this is Aonagi - Altitude 220! Aonagi landing, roger that. Runway Delta. But... he was so close... Nanba-san! Shit! I'm sorry... after I finally Nanba-san. Was there something Asahina-san told you? I noticed when I was coming down before... Is that true? It's nothing! It's just that I couldn't fly. Mochida-san and also you, Nanba-san... Is there really nothing- I said it's nothing! I'm sorry. Leave me alone for a bit. Nanba-san... You aren't going to tell Sorry. But...! You seem even more concerned about it! Let's stop this now. I'll tell you. Asahina-san? All of you, come to the Honestly, I was going to tell you all It's my responsibility. This... can't be true... Kuramochi-san crashing? Withdraw from the competition. Why? You're all upset about this. There's no way I can let I'm not upset or anything. After all, there's no way I can fly! I believe in Kuramochi-san. So, I... don't want to stop. Me too! Please. If Kuramochi-san is alive, he would Same for me. I don't want to give up now. What do you think? If they have made a decision... However. You must not forget to be present of mind! Even the slightest lack of care might soon become dangerous. Yes!
