(reflective music) - [Man] God gives us a new We belong with Him as he intended. (reflective music) The Bible says we will one day replace the rebellious sons (reflective music) He also gives us a mission. We're here to grow God's family. (reflective music) - We're gonna go on a fascinating journey. We'll explore some strange passages. We'll re-examine some familiar ones with meanings hidden in plain sight. We'll look at the Bible through the supernatural By the time we're done, you'll never be able to look at your Bible the same way again. There's a lot to be seen when it comes to the unseen realm. (reflective music) - The Bible asks us to believe a lot of strange things At first we might be but if we say we believe the Bible, we can't avoid these concepts. Much of what we think we isn't true. It's been filtered down through centuries of church tradition. Angels do not have wings. Demons don't have horns or tails. And for the biblical writers, the unseen realm was home to There were other bigger players. So do you believe what's in your Bible? - The rock accessory of Philippi might be the most imposing Imagine standing in front and hearing Jesus' words, &quot;Upon this rock I will build my church.&quot; This is the place where Jesus The scene of Peter's confession. And when Jesus added, &quot;will not be able to He knew what he was talking about. - Gates to Hell? Really? The authors of scripture believed the gods of Look at Psalm 82 carefully. - [Narrator] &quot;God stands &quot;He administers judgment - When you really look at but there it is plain as day. God presides over an assembly of gods that He calls His sons. We're just not used to in those terms, but that's what the Hebrew text says. Psalm 89 says the same thing about God's council in the heavens. - [Narrator] &quot;A God feared greatly &quot;in the council of the holy ones.&quot; - The Hebrew word translated Now most of the time it but sometimes it's plural, and Psalm 82:1 has both. The problem for us is that we think this is a problem for We're taught to associate with a specific set of unique attributes. That's why putting an S on but the word Elohim is not about The Bible itself tells us that. (reflective music) - Elohim is simply a word used to describe a supernatural being. It says nothing, nothing about attributes. That's why the biblical for other spirit beings besides God. It's used for the gods of the nations, it's used for demons, even the disembodied human dead. However, Yahweh is one of those Elohim and no other Elohim is like Him. I repeat, no other Elohim is like Him. The Bible describes Him in unique ways. There is only one of Him. One of Him. Existing as three persons: And He is the creator of all other Elohim. (reflective music) - Psalm 82 places the That term is appropriate because these beings participate Now certainly God doesn't need their help, but He lets them participate. Consider the strange story that the prophet Micaiah gave to the - [Narrator] &quot;Therefore, &quot;I saw Yahweh sitting on His throne &quot;with all the hosts of &quot;from His right hand &quot;And Yahweh said, &quot;Who will entice Ahab &quot;so that he will go up and &quot;Then this one was saying one thing &quot;and the other one was saying another. &quot;Then a spirit came out and &quot;I will entice him.&quot; &quot;and Yahweh said to him, &quot;How?&quot; &quot;He said, &quot;I will go out &quot;in the mouth of all his prophets.&quot; &quot;And He said, &quot;You shall &quot;go out and do so.&quot; &quot;So then, see that Yahweh &quot;in the mouth of all these your prophets, &quot;and Yahweh has spoken - Did you catch where the God meets with His heavenly host to decide what happens on earth. These beings, the gods of the council, are spirits, not people or idols. (reflective music) - Remember, Yahweh, the God a spirit being, but no He is one of a kind. He is the true God, with a capitol G. He alone is the perfect sovereign creator. He is the Most High God. Psalm 82:6 says God has sons, &quot;sons of the Most High&quot; is the phrase. - [Narrator] &quot;I have said, &quot;You are gods, and sons of - Who are these sons of God? It sounds odd. What about Jesus? How can there be all The answer is found in where Jesus is described Some translations say &quot;only begotten&quot; but the word actually means How is Jesus unique? The New Testament says he is God, the one uncreated God in the flesh. None of the other sons of (reflective music) - The sons of God language God was King and Kings assign in their government. So it is in the unseen realm. It's important because the that God wants a family. His family extends to and to Earth, and those two (reflective music) - God addressed His council when He created the first man and woman. The council was already there. - [Narrator] &quot;So God created &quot;in the likeness of God He created him, &quot;male and female He created them.&quot; - God told His heavenly family Now people often think God of the trinity, but that is not the case. The other members of the trinity are co-equal and co-omniscient. God wouldn't need to tell them anything. God speaks to His heavenly host here. Job 38 tells us the sons of God were present at the creation. - [Narrator] &quot;Where were you &quot;at my laying the foundation of the earth? &quot;When the morning stars &quot;and all of the sons of (reflective music) - The image of God concept how humans and the heavenly Both of God's families represent Him. The supernatural sons of God represent Him in the unseen realm, and (reflective music) - How do we represent God? We saw how divine beings God created humans to to make the earth all He envisioned and to enjoy it with Him. - Imaging God is a not a specific ability. We bear that status from the moment of conception until death. To be human is to image God, but God also shares Beginning with Adam and Eve, we were supposed to take care God wanted the whole (reflective music) - The knowledge that all humans prompts us to see all It leaves no room for racism. Injustice has no place and the abuse of power at cannot be justified. (reflective music) - Obviously the world isn't like Eden. People don't treat each other Not even close. What happened? The answer lies in God's with both His supernatural Now one of those attributes It is freedom not mere intelligence that allows for meaningful choices. God didn't program His If he did, we wouldn't truly be like Him. Having freedom meant God's And that's what happened. - Remember, we don't even though both humans and represent Him in their respective realm. God tells us in Job 15 that He He knows they can fail. - [Narrator] &quot;Look, He does &quot;and the heavens are - Eden was the home and His supernatural and earthly God wanted them to image Heaven and Earth, blended but one family member (hissing) - We've all heard about but why a serpent? What's that supposed to tell us? Ancient people knew how to We assume the serpent is merely an animal, his form is important but the The story is about a Isaiah alludes to that rebellion. - [Narrator] &quot;I will raise up my throne &quot;above the stars of God &quot;and I will sit on the &quot;I will make myself like the Most High.&quot; - Isaiah is talking about the Just like Job, he refers to them as stars. They were present before Eden. Ezekiel 28 mentions the In Ezekiel's case, a guardian cherub gets kicked out of Eden. - [Narrator] &quot;You were an &quot;and I placed you on God's holy mountain, &quot;you walked in the midst - Ancient Mesopotamia tablets talk about cherub throne guardians and describe them as snakes and dragons. The serpent of Eden was whose job was to guard God's throne. An ancient person would've known the scene was about a rebel - Like the supernatural rebel, Adam and Eve rebelled too. Eden was lost, the rebel He brought death to earth, He became Lord of the Dead. Since everyone would die, (dramatic music) Now most people know the Christian's believe it's why But that's actually incomplete. What happened in Eden was just why there's so much evil There were actually two more (dramatic music) - Genesis 6 describes the Some of the sons of God, transgressed the boundary (reflective music) - [Narrator] &quot;The sons of God &quot;saw the daughters of humankind, &quot;that they were beautiful. &quot;The Nephilim were upon &quot;and also afterward, when the sons of God &quot;went into the daughters of humankind, &quot;and they bore children to them.&quot; - Both Peter and Jude reference this story in the New Testament. - [Narrator] &quot;God did not &quot;but held them captive in &quot;and handed them over &quot;and did not spare the ancient - Jude also tells us about - [Narrator] &quot;The angels who did not keep &quot;to their own domain &quot;but deserted their proper dwelling place, &quot;he has kept in eternal &quot;for the judgment of the great day.&quot; - Both of these writers understood that Genesis 6 recorded the The fallen sons of God for their transgression. Tartarus is a Greek word what we think of as Hell. They'd stay there until at the end of days. A term like fallen angels like the ones Jesus cast out, but the rebels of so they can't be the So where did they come from? The answer lies in the offspring produced by the forbidden union, between the sons of God Those offspring were They were giants. Their descendants became the giant clans Moses and Joshua battled. - [Narrator] &quot;The Nephilim &quot;in those days, and also afterward.&quot; - In the books of numbers and Deuteronomy, we learned about the giants They not only descended from the Nephilim but they are called by and the Rephaim, that Several Bible passages of the Rephaim in the realm of the dead, again what we would think of as Hell. - Extra biblical Jewish like those described in the gospels, were disembodied spirits of the giants. They'd base this on the in the underworld. Jewish books like First Enoch and the Book of the Giants make that point explicitly. (reflective music) - If demons come from dead giants, what happened to the giants? Believe it or not, the answer comes from (dramatic music) God told Joshua to in the land of Canaan, but if you read the the losses he places where God told Joshua &quot;only drive them out, not kill them.&quot; Now this seems inconsistent, however when you understand for what God wanted Joshua to - It's fascinating to discover that the conquest actually Moses initially sent They reported about the and where they saw the giant, Anakim. 10 of the 12 spies convinced they could not win against the Anakim. God judged Israel with Notice that the giants were a focal point from the very beginning - At the end of the 40 years, God took Israel up through He told them not to bother since the giant clans in those lands had already been removed relatives of the Israelites. (reflective music) God sent Moses and Joshua to Bashan, the realm of Og, King of the Amorites. Og was a giant, the last of the Rephaim. The prophet Amos described them. - [Narrator] &quot;I destroyed &quot;who was as tall as cedars &quot;and was as strong as the oaks.&quot; - The point is that once all the giants from the other side of Joshua could take the people into Canaan. Joshua took the Israelites into the land. It's important to notice that the places that were designated correspond to the places The giant descendants of the Nephilim were the real targets of the killing. Many people died because but the descendants of the - The Nephilim and their descendants were from the divine They had been raised up to oppose God and destroy His people. Now in this light, the laid out on earth. Either God's people, Israel, would survive or be annihilated. The story is cast as an in both the spiritual and earthly sense. Joshua could drive out people, but the descendants of the (reflective music) This is why when Joshua he said &quot;There are no The only ones left went One of those cities was Gath, the home of Goliath and his brothers, and eventually David of eliminating the - The conquest is ultimately about God protecting His own children against a cosmically empowered threat, bent on stopping Yahweh - God's original program to spread Eden throughout the earth. All people were to be God's people. The whole earth was to be God's domain, but that gets ruined and destroyed, but God never gives up God called the people to Yahweh wanted a land and the Anakim, descendants of rival gods, would stop at nothing to prevent that. - The first two spiritual the giants, and the but there was one more ancient This one would produce and change the entire landscape of God's relationship with humanity. But ultimately, they for God's redemption plan. - [Narrator] &quot;Come, let &quot;and a tower whose top &quot;And Yahweh said, &quot;Come, let us go down &quot;and confuse their language there, &quot;so that they will not understand &quot;Therefore its name was called Babel.&quot; - Now this is a really familiar story, but less familiar is how the - [Narrator] &quot;When the Most &quot;at his dividing up the sons of humankind, &quot;he fixed the boundaries of the peoples, &quot;according to the number &quot;For Yahweh's portion was his people, &quot;Jacob the share of his inheritance.&quot; - When was humanity divided into nations? That was at Babel. God allotted the nations to the members of His divine council. The Bible says this is why the ancient nations worshiped other gods. God decided to let the govern the other nations in response to humanities - But the gods of the nations God chastises them in Psalm 82. - [Narrator] &quot;God stands &quot;He administers judgment &quot;How long will you judge unjustly &quot;and show favoritism to the wicked?&quot; - Then God pronounces a judgment on them. - [Narrator] &quot;I have said, &quot;You are gods, &quot;and sons of the Most High, all of you. &quot;However, you will die like men, &quot;and you will fall like - The gods will be judged, It's startling to read these things. God is so angry with His that He condemns them. Some passages in the prophets place the fulfillment of this punishment in the end times at the day of the Lord. - [Narrator] &quot;For the anger of Yahweh &quot;is against all the nations, &quot;and His wrath is against all their host &quot;all the host of heaven shall rot. &quot;All their host shall wither. &quot;On that day: Yahweh will &quot;in heaven, and the kings - This situation is at the heart of what scholars call cosmic geography. It's the idea that the were under the dominion Those nations and their gods surrounded the holy ground of Israel, Yahweh's portion of the earth. (reflective music) The Book of Daniel picks up on that idea. It discloses that supernatural beings govern individual nations. In other words, evil intelligences influence the geopolitics - [Narrator] &quot;But the prince &quot;stood before me for 21 days. &quot;And look, Michael, one &quot;came to assist me.&quot; - Each of these nations a term that means ruler. - [Narrator] &quot;Now I return &quot;to fight against the prince of Persia, &quot;and look, the prince of Javan will come. &quot;And there is not one who contends with me &quot;against these beings &quot;except Michael, your prince.&quot; - Michael is the guardian of Israel. The big picture reveals that there is an unseen spiritual conflict behind the empires of the earth. (reflective music) - Second Kings 5 illustrates In that story, Naaman, a visits Israel in search To his surprise and joy, Elijah heals him of leprosy, but afterward he makes a really interesting request of Elijah. - [Narrator] &quot;Then Naaman said, &quot;If not, then please let a load of soil &quot;on a pair of mules be &quot;for your servants will never &quot;and sacrifice to other gods, &quot;but only to Yahweh.&quot; - Naaman asked Elijah Why? Because now he worshiped Yahweh. He wanted holy ground to worship on. (reflective music) Cosmic geography is something It's about holy ground, a place for Yahweh to dwell Do we realize how dramatic the When it was over, God had no But God still wanted a family and He already had a He'd begin with one man, named Abraham. - The Bible recounts many stories of God speaking from heaven. But God did something more dramatic when it came to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He appeared as a man. Both Genesis and Acts will tell us God came to Abraham in a vision. Visions are things you see. The Old Testament often Standing, sitting, walking. Invisible voices don't stand, God appears as a man in the Old Testament, most often as the angel of the lord. Jacob first encountered Yahweh at Bethel, a man who was more than wrestled him there. That man was described as an angel and an Elohim. That's why the angel &quot;I am the god of Bethel.&quot; That's amazing. An angel refers to himself as God. But even more startling where Jacob blesses Joseph's - [Narrator] &quot;The God &quot;Abraham and Isaac, walked, &quot;The God who shepherded me &quot;The angel who redeemed me from all evil, &quot;may he bless the boys.&quot; - Jacob's prayer has three lines. &quot;May the God before &quot;May the God who shepherded me.&quot; And in the third line, where we expect him to mention God again, he swaps in, &quot;May the angel And then he asks, &quot;May he bless the boys.&quot; Not may they bless the boys, That's what the Hebrew text says. Jacob identified the angel with God. Genesis intentionally draws a parallel between the identity of the But it goes even deeper. Two other concepts are They are the word and the name. - [Narrator] &quot;Look, I am about &quot;to guard you on the way &quot;to bring you to the place &quot;Do not rebel against him, &quot;because he will not &quot;for my name is in him.&quot; - When God tells Moses he's telling Moses that The angel here possesses something only God can do. When Yahweh says He put He's referring to His own presence. It sounds odd, but sometimes the name is actually described as a person. - [Narrator] &quot;Look! &quot;The name of Yahweh comes from afar, &quot;burning with His anger - The Bible does that because Even today observant Jews who don't want to pronounce God's name will refer to God himself as HaShem. That's Hebrew for the name. This reminds us of the burning bush where God reveals His name. Exodus 3 says both God and - [Narrator] &quot;And Moses &quot;and the angel of Yahweh appeared to him &quot;in a flame of fire from &quot;And Yahweh saw that &quot;and God called to him from - Yahweh reveals His name to Jesus revealed it as well. - [Narrator] &quot;I have revealed your name.&quot; - Of course the Jews it was in their Bible. Jesus was saying he had If they had seen him, they had seen God. God's appearance as a prepared people to receive (reflective music) - On their way to the promise land, God gave Israel the law. But obedience to the law wasn't how Israelites obtained salvation. It was how they showed loyalty to Yahweh. It would help them to live in harmony with God and each other. Salvation in the Bible is Israelites had to believe He made them to be with Him as His family because He loved them. They needed to refuse to - Salvation today and in the New Testament makes the same demand in a different way. We must believe that the god of all gods came to earth as a man in Jesus Christ. We must believe that He loved us enough to die on the cross so that we could be in And we must put our faith in (reflective music) - The law taught people God is holy and the space Sacred space is physical space, set apart and dedicated to - [Man] The Mosaic law comprises 613 laws. Many of them sound quite strange. You couldn't eat shellfish or combine different kinds There was an entire litany of clean and unclean animals and behaviors. - These laws were about ritual purity. They taught people the space was different than their living space. - [Man] Cosmic geography The most holy part of the land Certain laws alerted an Israelite to the idea that Yahweh's Sacrifices reminded and also purified sacred space and objects so God's people could worship Him. - Sacred space encompasses more than the purification It distinguishes between It even marked the unholy territory outside of Yahweh's land. (dramatic music) - In Israel's world, sacred space reminded Israelite's of Eden. It was the place where God lived and where He desired humans to live. The design of the golden lamp stand in the holy place of the tabernacle was a reminder of the tree of life. God's throne room. The Holy of Holies, where the Ark of the Covenant The Ark's lid functioned This echoes God's presence in Eden. - Over the Ark sat two cherubim, just as cherubim guarded Lush decorations of vegetation, lions and pomegranates They reminded the Israelite's the garden of Eden. - You might wonder how before Israel got into the land. The Israelite camp was holy ground. Outside the camp was the domain of the lesser gods from Babel. (dramatic music) - Think about it. While Israel was traveling they were not yet in Yahweh's Laws about sacred space taught Israelites that Their home was sacred and that other nations (dramatic music) - If the Israelite camp in the wilderness was considered holy, outside The annual Day of Atonement (dramatic music) - Two goats were involved in the ceremony. One goat was sacrificed, but one was not. The one sacrificed was for the lord. The one left alive was for Azazel. - [Narrator] &quot;Then Aaron shall &quot;one lot for Yahweh and one for Azazel. &quot;But he must present alive before Yahweh &quot;the goat on which the lot for Azazel fell &quot;to make atonement for himself, &quot;to send it away into (reflective music) - The crucifixion of Jesus paralleled the Day of Atonement ceremony. His cross was placed outside the city, away from the temple area, (dramatic music) Jesus bore the sins of the (dramatic music) - Why didn't the powers of darkness understand what would happen at the cross? Well, Paul gives us some insight into the way God shrouded His plan for redemption in mystery. - [Narrator] &quot;We speak &quot;in a mystery, which God predestined &quot;before the ages for our glory, &quot;which none of the &quot;For if they had known it, &quot;they would not have - Do you realize what Paul is saying here? If the forces of spiritual darkness had understood Jesus was as a sacrifice for sin, they never would have had him killed. - Even the disciples didn't Consider how they responded he was going to Jerusalem to die. They were shocked. Peter even rebuked Jesus. - [Narrator] &quot;And Peter took him aside &quot;and began to rebuke him, saying, &quot;God forbid, Lord! &quot;This will never happen to you! &quot;But he turned around and said to Peter, &quot;Get behind me, Satan!&quot; - Jesus would have none of it. Jesus was on a divine secret mission. - The Old Testament leaves clues scattered throughout dozens but it doesn't spell it God didn't want the powers The intelligent supernatural evil beings knew that the prophesied Matthew records an encounter. - [Narrator] &quot;Two demon-possessed men &quot;coming from among the tombs met him, &quot;they cried out, saying, &quot;What do you have to &quot;Have you come here to - They recognized Jesus, but that they understood what Jesus was up to. (reflective music) The forces of darkness were duped into conspiring to kill Jesus. It was a divinely designed misdirection. - Intelligent evil. Satan, demons, the lesser Only God is all knowing, (reflective music) - Why did Jesus have to die? Why would God plan such a thing? So that His children That's what Eden was supposed to be. The first supernatural rebellion in Eden brought death into God's world. Everyone was destined to end where the serpent was cast down. - Death had to be overcome. That means resurrection, but you can't have a - Jesus knew what had to be done. He volunteered for that role. He would die in our place, God wants us to believe in His plan. He never gave up on including That's why Jesus came. There was no plan B. - [Narrator] &quot;But as many as received him, &quot;to those who believe in his name, &quot;he gave to them authority (dramatic music) - It's easy to get the impression that Jesus' ministry was somewhat random, but to what Jesus was doing. He was outwitting the evil one. Jesus drew the battle - [Narrator] &quot;Now is the &quot;Now the ruler of this &quot;And I, when I am lifted &quot;will draw all people to myself.&quot; - Satan is the ruler of this world. He's also very clever. Satan knew that Jesus wanted to be part of God's family and kingdom. So he offered Jesus all There was just one catch. - [Narrator] &quot;The devil took &quot;and showed him all the &quot;and their glory, &quot;and he said to him, &quot;I will give to you all these things, &quot;if you will fall down and worship me.&quot; - There's no clearer Satan's offer to Jesus was real. The thought of Jesus, Yahweh in the flesh, prostrate, worshiping at He's the ultimate megalomaniac. Jesus told Satan to get lost. He knew something Satan didn't, that he was going to to liberate anyone who God and His son already had a plan to bring people into God's family, one that didn't involve worshiping Satan. - When Jesus had his he didn't reveal God's plan. That plan was to reclaim allotted to lesser gods at Babel. Jesus didn't even tell his disciples until a very specific incident. Remember that huge rock we saw earlier? It's time to talk about - Jesus brought his disciples to a place called Caesarea Philippi, and Herod Philip. That was the Roman name. It's in an area known in Canaanites believed to the underworld, the gates of Hell, but in New Testament times, Paneas, one of the Decapolis cities and Pan's cave was also known as a gateway to the underworld. But why did Jesus bring them there? Because the implicit Jesus to be the messiah, Jesus is the real Messiah, the Son of God and these statues and that emperor are so not the sons of God. - Caesarea Philippi was also located at the base of Mount Hermon. In some of the Dead Sea Mount Hermon was the place descended to earth before the flood. Bashan and Hermon were ground zero for the cosmic evil powers. Jesus was standing at Satan's front door when he announced the gates of Hell would not withstand the church. - In this place Jesus asked Peter, &quot;Who do you say I am?&quot; And Peter answered. - [Narrator] &quot;You are the Christ, &quot;the Son of the living God!&quot; - Jesus commended Peter and declared. - [Narrator] &quot;I also say &quot;and on this rock I will build my church, &quot;and the gates of Hades - The identification of this rock has been debated for a very long time. The area's geography is the key to understanding this passage. - Eventually this place The god Pan was represented with horns, a goat's beard, a crooked a tail and goat's feet. That's why the early church described the devil in those ways. In a few days Jesus would up into Mount Hermon and put on notice with the transfiguration. - [Narrator] &quot;Jesus took &quot;and led them to a high &quot;And he was transfigured before them. &quot;And a cloud came, overshadowing them, &quot;and a voice came from the cloud, &quot;This is my beloved Son. &quot;Listen to him!&quot; - Right after Jesus did these things at the gates of Hell on Mount Hermon, he began to teach his disciples that he needed to go to Jerusalem to die. The thought panicked them, But Jesus knew it was time (dramatic music) - A week later Jesus arrived in Jerusalem for his triumphal entry. Jesus' provocations of led to the devil striking back. Satan entered Judas, whose led to Jesus' trial. He stood accused before who demanded that he defend himself. - [Narrator] &quot;The high priest said to him, &quot;I put you under oath by the living God, &quot;that you tell us if you are (reflective music) - Jesus' answer sounds evasive to us, even cryptic, he replied. - [Narrator] &quot;You have said it. &quot;But I tell you, from now on &quot;sitting at the right hand of the Power &quot;and coming on the clouds of heaven.&quot; - Caiaphas burst into a rage. He tore his robe saying, But why did Caiaphas think Jesus had quoted an Old Testament passage that Caiaphas knew very well. - [Narrator] &quot;Ancient of Days sat; &quot;his clothing was like white snow &quot;and the hair of his &quot;And look, with the clouds of heaven &quot;one like a son of man was coming, &quot;and he came to the Ancient of Days, &quot;and was presented before him. &quot;And to him was given dominion (reflective music) - Why was it so shocking that he was the one coming on the clouds? Because everywhere else that expression was used For instance, in Psalm 104 &quot;makes the clouds his chariot.&quot; (reflective music) But Daniel 7 is an exception. God was already in the scene, he's the Ancient of Days That means the one coming on the clouds was a different person. (reflective music) The scene has God in human form twice. He is the seated Ancient of Days, and you would also expect God to be the one coming on the clouds because that is a title for Him. Because of this scene, had a doctrine called &quot;The They actually identified two Jesus claimed to be one of them, the son of man riding on the clouds. (reflective music) - Jesus' claim to be God was enough for the priest to declare and die he did. Psalm 22 gives us a glimpse on the cross. - [Narrator] &quot;All who see me mock me. &quot;They open wide their lips; &quot;they shake the head, saying: &quot;He trusts Yahweh. &quot;Let him rescue him. &quot;Many bulls have encircled me; &quot;mighty bulls of Bashan &quot;They open their mouth against me &quot;like a lion tearing and roaring. &quot;I am poured out like water, &quot;and all my bones are out of joint. &quot;My heart is like wax; &quot;it is melted within me.&quot; (reflective music) - The creepy part is the description of the mighty bulls of Bashan. Remember that Bashan to demonic gods and the realm of the dead. The area was a leading center symbolized by bulls and cows. Mighty bulls of Bashan refers to demons and the powers of darkness. - C.S. Lewis captured &quot;The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe.&quot; No one can forget when to the hordes of the White Witch but just as Aslan so too Jesus turned this apparent defeat into the greatest triumph of all time. - Jesus triumphed over death. He was granted authority over all things. Satan has no claim over God's people. Jesus conquered death (triumphant music) - In the Book of Acts, the Holy Spirit explodes onto the scene with his arrival at Pentecost. It's a familiar story to Christians. There's more there than you first realize. - [Narrator] &quot;Suddenly a sound &quot;came from heaven and &quot;where they were sitting. &quot;And divided tongues like &quot;and rested on each one of them. &quot;And they were all filled &quot;and began to speak in other languages.&quot; - The Old Testament with fire and a violent wind. Ezekiel 1 is a good example. - [Narrator] &quot;The heavens were opened, &quot;and I saw visions of God. &quot;A storm wind was coming from &quot;and fire flashing back and forth.&quot; - The spirit of God enabled to speak in the languages of the surrounding nations (mysterious music) God was reversing the judgment at Babel. Part of that judgment had been to divide nations. The Spirit was supernaturally but there's more going on. Pentecost was a slap in the Their authority had been nullified. God was going to take the nations back. God gave the risen Jesus all the authority he This is why the Great Commission - [Narrator] &quot;All authority &quot;has been given to me. &quot;Therefore, go and make - The nations listed in Acts 2 cover all of the geography associated with the Pentecost sent the message that God was reclaiming those nations. They could once again be (dramatic music) - The apostle Paul often whose domains he violated He understood the Old - Paul lists rulers and powers, dominions, lords, and thrones. All of these terms indicate They reflect how the Old Testament depicts the relationship of Paul was the apostle to the gentiles. He knew that he was up against allotted to people excluded - Paul says something that helps us see that influenced the way he - [Narrator] &quot;Therefore, &quot;and sealed this fruit &quot;I will depart by way of you for Spain.&quot; - Why did Paul care On the one hand, some think it's the not mentioned in the Book of Acts. The land of Tarshish. Clement, the early church father from the end of the first century AD says that Paul went to in order to reach the in the Roman Empire. - [Narrator] &quot;Having taught &quot;and having come to the - In other words, Jonah went to Tarshish to get away from proclaiming Paul went to Spain to reach the gentiles at the end of the earth - God knew that the Great Commission was bigger than just Paul could imagine. It falls to us to bring the gospel to the outermost parts of the earth. - Paul had a supernatural He viewed himself as set apart. As an instrument for God's use. We have the same task of invading the demonic with the message of the - Remember our discussion You might wonder where And sure, the Bible teaches but it actually marks his (reflective music) - Paul writes that God within each believer. In other words, every (reflective music) - God was present in the temple. Today the same is true wherever The Bible says the people of God are collectively God's temple. - [Narrator] &quot;You are fellow &quot;and members of the household of God, &quot;built on the foundation of &quot;You also are built up together &quot;into a dwelling place - Together we are God's temple. The special place where Wherever believers gather, the spiritual ground we occupy is sanctified amid the powers of darkness. - Believe it or not, baptism is a declaration Peter explains that idea It's odd to us, but people in Peter's day would've known just what to do with it. - [Narrator] &quot;For Christ &quot;being put to death in the flesh, &quot;but made alive in the spirit, &quot;in which also he went &quot;and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, &quot;who were formerly disobedient, &quot;when the patience of God &quot;Corresponding to this, &quot;An appeal to God for a good conscience, &quot;through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, &quot;who is at the right hand of God. &quot;With angels and authorities and powers &quot;having been subjected to him.&quot; - At first glance, Spirits in prison, baptism, seem to have little to do with each other and baptism can't save us. Believing in Jesus saves us. What's going on here? (reflective music) - To understand what we have to understand as an analogy for Jesus Peter uses Enoch. - [Narrator] &quot;And Enoch walked with God &quot;and he was no more, for God took him.&quot; - We don't learn much about just three verses.

Peter's second Epistle being held in chains of gloomy darkness. In First Enoch, the fallen sons of God ask Enoch to see if since Enoch had God's favor, they thought it was worth a try. In First Enoch, God rejects after Enoch reports to him. He sends Enoch down into the abyss, he descends to the spirits in That's the point of analogy for Peter. Just as Enoch descended so Jesus descended into the same realm to proclaim something to them. What did he proclaim? They thought that since Jesus they had won. Jesus told them they were wrong, and he rose on the third day to prove it. They were still doomed. - But how does this connect to baptism and a good conscience? - An appeal to God for a good conscience in First Peter 3 means a sincere pledge. In essence, baptism was a loyalty oath and repeated the message Enoch and then Jesus gave to the of just whose side of the (reflective music) - That's why baptism is an Whether we realize it or not, we're being watched by both (reflective music) - [Narrator] &quot;That through these &quot;you may become sharers &quot;after escaping from the - Being partakers of the divine nature means we will be like God. We will have a body like Jesus We will have eternal life and with the loyal members we will be in God's family God will succeed in uniting His divine and human family for eternity, but the most amazing part is how Jesus, the unique When Jesus became a man, he was made for a short time a Listen to the writer to the Hebrews. - [Narrator] &quot;But now we do not yet see &quot;all things subjected to &quot;for a short time made &quot;so that apart from God &quot;on behalf of everyone.&quot; - Because God became man in Jesus, his mortal followers will become like him. And members of God's family.

He is the firstborn, or the head, the one who receives the John puts this even more succinctly. - [Narrator] &quot;We will be like him.&quot; - That's our future. But what about now? Sometimes when we hear we process it only in but our eternal destiny That turns grace into duty. That's just bad theology. The Bible teaches salvation God loves us and wants to if we will only believe in it. - Until that day, God wants us to tell the epic story of His war to help Him release those still held captive by (reflective music) - Well it's pretty obvious The world is full of darkness, but supernatural evil has no claim on us. Jesus is ruling at the right hand of God. We are sacred space, since but we await the lord's As theologists like to say, but not yet. (reflective music) - The already but not yet paradox is an important biblical idea. On the already side of things, God gives us a new We belong with Him as He intended. He also gives us a mission. We're here to grow God's family. (reflective music) The not yet part of our The Bible says we will one day replace the rebellious sons of Consider what Paul says. - [Narrator] &quot;Do you not know - The Book of Revelation where we will rule with - [Narrator] &quot;Hold fast to &quot;And the one who conquers &quot;and who keeps my works until the end, &quot;I will give him authority &quot;and I will give him the morning star.&quot; - Think about it.

That's a title for the ruling messiah. - [Narrator] &quot;I, Jesus, am the root &quot;and the descendant of David, &quot;the bright morning star.&quot; - Incredibly, we share the morning star. We share the messiah's Elsewhere in the Book of Revelation, Jesus shares his throne with us. - [Narrator] &quot;Behold, I &quot;If anyone hears my &quot;indeed I will come in &quot;and he with me. &quot;The one who conquers, I will grant to him &quot;to sit down with me on my throne, &quot;as I also have conquered and &quot;on his throne.&quot; (reflective music) - God and man will be The dominion of the world will return to its proper sovereign. Heaven will return to earth. Eden will be restored. God created us to be in His family and to enjoy His world with Him.
