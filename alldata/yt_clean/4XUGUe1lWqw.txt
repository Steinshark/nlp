On the tarmac of Bogota airport, a lost family. This family is not it's that of Pablo Escobar, the Colombian godfather of ***. The most wanted criminal in the world. They hoped to take refuge in Frankfurt, but Germany turned them back. The Escobar family is first and foremost Juan Pablo. In her arms, And behind, Maria Victoria, Pablo Escobar's wife. They are tired, but above all, they are afraid. Pablo Escobar is on the run and he is no longer the man Colombia for years. Public enemy number one lives From his hiding place somewhere the drug trafficker - Escobar had an Achilles heel. It was his family, It was his whole life. This Achilles heel, Colombian police As soon as they arrived, the woman are placed under close surveillance They have become bait. All we have to do is wait and finally falls - Escobar has escaped us so much It was truly incredible. - Escobar threw bombs in supermarkets. He was throwing bombs everywhere. - He had infiltrated the families He knew where he lived how many brothers they had. Sixteen years later, Medellin. The sulphurous city at the heart 50 minutes flight from Bogota, Medellin is the second one of the most active the breadbasket of Colombia. But it also remains the most violent wanted notices. Sixteen years later, The settling of scores continues, but they are done today between Nothing to do with the Escobar era. - Medellin at the time, We ate balls and for dinner, Yes, that's it, we ate each other - There were deaths every day? - Every morning, we discovered At the time, we called it Escobar began his career Afterwards, he stole cars. And then he attacked with a small local sponsor. And you know, here, the bad ones with his own hands this godfather In Medellin, Escobar's relatives but there would be a few survivors. This is the first track According to the information collected, a lieutenant of Pablo Escobar Some pictures of him We found them. It's about this man, Jhon Jairo Velesquez, aka Popeye. At the time, on wanted posters, the photo of Popeye is in good He was accused of several murders. According to our sources, the man is in prison Our investigation tells us through the safest neighborhoods, from the old prison A prison where violence where the prisoners themselves Since then, Escobar's former right-hand man, was secretly During many days, Nobody knows where he is. But ultimately, our tenacity Popeye is now incarcerated in this more modern prison. In fact, a high power plant blocks by blocks, d*** traffickers, hitmen. No camera ever enters here. Too dangerous. At our insistence, an authorization A one-on-one interview the most loyal lieutenant. He is in the best position today, to tell what everyday life was like, the run of Pablo Escobar. - At the time, in Medellin, there were more than 1500 men Israelis, English, The Colombian secret services, the DEA, the research section and I'm probably forgetting some. Everyone, Popeye never argued executor of dirty work. He claimed responsibility for 250 assassinations, out of the 10,000 that would have - One day I had a very We executed it but leave the hotel The cops had sent They shot me I came home and there, I received a visit I then understood that I had the Medellin cartel was an army I was a lamb. Mid 70s, At the head of a horde he reigns over the traffic in d***. At their side, an army of killers. We call them here the Sicarios. 300 men dedicated body and soul. The famous Medellin cartel, they are the ones. The specialty of this cartel, the trade of ***. The very particular geography a country covered Pablo Escobar will exploit it For centuries, farmers Pablo Escobar offers them that of industrialization. In the middle of the jungle, tens There, in the greatest secrecy, the best chemists to obtain the pasta, the dough. First stage of transformation - There is kerosene there and 20 centiliters of acid are added. Afterwards, we add ammonia, to separate the coca Otherwise, you can filter with this cloth. So here is the pasta, which, once dry and refined, will give powder ***, The sequel, Pablo Escobar To transport your goods, by sea, by air, the c*** is routed to At that time, this drug was The scourge of *** is going global. Escobar is never short of ideas. To deliver to home he even goes so far as to build In 1980, Escobar He became the godfather Bold, cruel, inescapable. - He had introduced a tax For example, if a trafficker Escobar told him: because I protect you and the Colombian State.&quot; And if the guy didn't want to pay, In just ten years, Escobar will From grave robber in Medellin, An almighty godfather His fortune at the time is estimated - All this money gave him that soon he felt And as if its power Escobar pushes the nerve up in front of the gates In Miami, Florida, it's his money invests in real estate American authorities. Escobar becomes the worst nightmare In Washington, federal justice - It was then that he formed with his friends the Extradables, rather a coffin in Colombia He declares war on the Colombian state And this war, all the consequences. The true nature of Escobar that of a psychopath. He massacres all those Magistrates, journalists, politicians, police and anonymous. For Colombia, An estimated 10,000 direct or indirect. - Sometimes we went there, dead children, babies, simply because their parents at the wrong time. The most serious attack some time before Christmas 89, right in the center of Bogota. That day, it's the service tower The 500 kilos of dynamite but the explosion misses General Miguel Maza Marquez, boss of the secret services. Since Pablo Escobar declared this man went after him. He swore to have the skin - My secretary was crushed All my bodyguards killed. Below, There were dead people everywhere, mutilated, headless people. And it took me a long time, to get out of this nightmare. I even needed for ten years. This is one blow too many. The Colombian government decides There is a price on his head. He becomes public enemy number one. Pablo Escobar, aka the Doctor, disappears into nature. It is in the Sierra that a team finds him in the course of a report. The meeting is a global scoop. The first time films the drug trafficker. Pablo Escobar will take advantage of it We have to be realistic. We are in The shit is happening For what ? Because she's a weaker bitch, The drug problem is a problem and discipline, There is no difference between and a drug addict. And a little later, the godfather against the *** trade. Currently, it's the *** She is the evil one because she because they are the Colombians That's the fundamental problem. That year, the Medellin cartel, exports 300 kilos of c*** For Americans, Once again, is claimed. Wanted in his country, hunted down by American justice, He then decides to give it a shot, bargain for your freedom A real asset to avoid June 1991, a strange caravan, rises to the heights of Medellin, In cars, Escobar accepts but in a prison from plans he had drawn. Here everything has been decided In short, a prison without a key, On the radio, Escobar A surrender for good he says. In this historic moment when for the pacification of the country, I cannot remain indifferent claimed by the majority Pablo Escobar Gaviria. The Catedral is a prison equipped with the most sophisticated comfort. High tech kitchen, stereo, An incredible luxury for the time. Outside, The telescope allows the comings and goings of the police. And also his family who remained downstairs During the day, Pablo They continue to manage - The Catedral Prison, it was the HQ of delinquency, the traffic center of d*** and the government At night, the Catedral transforms, like a real brothel. - The boss had all the women At the time there were only 2 guys him and another, with his plane, he was going to pick up the girls - One day, he had sent for type of model for We had managed to infiltrate He learned it. And he had her murdered, with the 49 others. And at the end of the week, we found bodies, heads, feet. It was terrible. You have to know or when we represented it was certain death. When the country discovers the conditions it's a scandal. The Colombian President - No, the Catedral What happened was he had that we discovered very late that all were actually paid by him. The Colombian government in a real prison. This one senses a trap. He refuses. The following night, Escobar escapes with his friend Popeye and a dozen men. - Pablo and I escaped No policemen, no soldiers, We left around 11 p.m., at this We joined a friend's farm For our safety, we prevented his The general alert is given. After a year behind the walls, to return to clandestinity. For the police, we have to act quickly. The godfather is here, everywhere at home. Every wasted hour can give him Nothing is left to chance. Every house in the suburbs of Medellin To start of course But in the name of God, In the early morning of July 22, 92, We must face the facts, Escobar has disappeared. The government in Bogota is exasperated. Barely 24 hours after the invasion, he creates the &quot;busqueda block&quot;, a search section tracking down Escobar. She is housed An elite unit, 1000 police officers selected with great care. The general staff ensures that they do not have that they all have a score to settle or a murdered father. At their head, the Colombian government, places Colonel Hugo Martinez. At the time, the man was rather discreet. Photos of him At his side, to support him, an intelligence professional, Major Hugo Aguilar. For journalists, To her only, Aguilar, Martinez, upon their appointment, on his list of men to kill. Sixteen years later, we have Aguilar, first of all. He agreed to meet us Even today, it remains threatened, The former soldier became a man but above all it is for the manhunt he led Martinez, he He became a general. The years spent chasing marked him forever. For us, he finally accepted For the first time, every moment lived From the creation of the section the Americans send very special diplomats, specialized soldiers, on these archive images, these gringos in civilian clothes are numerous. For its part, the DEA, designate its two best agents. Javier Pena and Stephen Murphy. They will work in the field The section brought together the best We had all the resources Money, equipment, intelligence services. It was at this time that the DEA, launched a real hunt But this time on a scale In Medellin, it is a state of siege. The search section is everywhere. The checks are permanent, systematic raking. The first weeks few things. Weapons, telephone, dynamite, classic in Medellin. Classic too, the arrest In truth, it's finding the informer, the informant, which will take them back to Escobar. But despite the rewards, television calls Because denounce the godfather amounts to certain death. Result, the months pass and Escobar remains nowhere to be found. Despite the weariness and the risks, the research section is required And often the informants Escobar's childhood neighborhood. - We must remember that people For many, he was Robin Hood. He had helped the poor, distributed a lot of money. In fact, these people idolized him That day, what the police these are some Unfortunately, a few minutes late. There were Pablo's accomplices here. They were there a short time ago. In meeting. To block it, the fiascos Elite soldiers, This is still not enough. To catch Escobar, Priority is now given The Americans send and continuously run a twin-engine In a manhunt, Suddenly, Colonel Martinez hundreds of conversations without interruption every day, Until this early morning in March 93. - We hear Escobar with his son from his cell phone. The problem, The American twin-engine, which turns still manages to locate The pilot sends me immediately and I postpone them to know the exact area This time, the triangulation calculations in the chic suburbs of Medellin. Escobar is there, that's for sure. All that remains is to pick it. At dawn, the assault is given, But inside, only a few poorly awakened employees. Elephant tusks! - Who owns this house? - To Adrian Moreno. Moreno, a name often used - What is his business? - I swear I don't know. - What bad taste these narcos have! Upstairs, the police are not Everything is extravagant there. As in all residences A real collection of shoes! It's a shell bathtub! Men may search no trace of the drug trafficker. The bed is unmade, still warm, Escobar was warned in time. It's always the same... We only find the employees. And that's how it is in It's been 8 months now of his tailor-made prison. Every day that passes is a snub of the research section. At the beginning, we missed it quite a bit Yet we heard it on the radio. We sent the intervention groups but we always missed it. Over time, Pablo Escobar becomes His escape and especially his baraka In the streets of poor neighborhoods, there are many of them now - If Pablo came here, he wouldn't even need He is here, at home, whenever he wants. If he comes, we will welcome him He is always welcome. Protections, of his cartel accomplices, with other sponsors Sixteen years later, the vast majority A few members remain today the only ones now to hold, the secrets of the Godfather's escape. So these are the ones we are going to According to our information, and the widow of Pablo Escobar, left Colombia. They took refuge in Argentina. Only his brother, Roberto. And his younger sister Alba Marina, still live in Medellin. During Pablo's time, the Escobar family The brother and sister liked to go out, Today, it's rather low profile Thanks to the complicity we get the address - Is this where Mrs. Escobar lives? - She's there ? - No, sorry, - We'll leave him a note then. Waiting at the hotel No call, no answer, to our meeting proposal. You have to say distrust remains the rule. And then on the fourth day, Alba Marina accepts We know now, Alba Marina was the accomplice persecution, as she says. So she knows all his secrets. And always devoted to his brother - This is my favorite photo of Pablo, at the time when he was He looks so happy. Nobody knows that I kept These are Pablo's objects that I have These are the tennis shoes he used. Her indoor slippers This shirt is very famous, And here is Pablo's latest diary, where all his appointments are registered and a map too. It's a map of a hiding place In this diary, there was also their addresses, their contact details. The names of their fathers, their mothers. And here is the hairpiece with which I look like him, don't I? The souvenir trunk has had its effect. Alba Marina is reassured. She now accepts us - This place is called Penol, but we also nicknamed him In fact, Penol is a At the time, Alba Marina when police pressure - Do you see these houses? Depending on the circumstances, sometimes even a week. The sister brings her brother on the run, food, letters in the greatest secrecy. Despite the risk, it is often - It was all ours. We owned all the farms Pablo had given them And this house where we are Even surrounded by family the godfather remains alert. - I remember we had throughout Medellin. We never stayed in the same place. I especially remember that we had to Every month. That's where I learned Pablo Escobar also two years older than him. Images of this man at the time It must be said that Roberto Escobar His specialty, accounting. In his memoirs, Roberto Escobar, even admits to having been one of the *** Empire. He will play of course, on the run from his brother. Before leaving us, Alba Marina To contact Roberto, his brother, you need to call a contact - Hello, we would like - To do an interview with Don Roberto We need to discuss it, I mean, pay compensation. I do not know exactly We agree to set with the person concerned himself. The woman finally accepts - Don Roberto? - Good morning. - I am a French journalist. - Yes I'm fine and you ? - Don Roberto, can we - Yes of course. - Where ? - Come to the gas station - Thank you very much, Don Roberto. The appointment has been set for us, right in the residential area The only condition imposed, that we come without a camera. We decide despite everything In his youth, Roberto Escobar, was a professional cyclist, before changing route Even today, on the walls memories of that time. These years in the cartel Don Roberto no longer wishes except for Hollywood producers, to whom he promised exclusivity - The story of Pablo's escape, I am even one of the best placed I lived alongside We were the best friends in the world, inseparable brothers. We did everything together, we went everywhere, even during the Great Hunt, We won't know more. He just consents During Pablo's run, In his cell, that he had hidden And that's how he continued - The people who came saw only a simple television. But I could speak because I had installed there I disguised my voice "Hey brother, are you okay? What are you doing ? That's it, that's how it is June 1993, a year after his escape, He moves around Medellin, and changing every week. It's one of his aunts, Luzmila, who does the shopping and cooking for him. At each appointment he sets for her, she discovers a new neighborhood. - There it is, it's here. There, on the third floor. During the day, with a towel on his head. He looked at people I told him: And we both laughed. In his escape, Escobar takes advantage and mistresses always - We often went out to the center on foot, by taxi or in a minibus. I had just had my baby to hide his face. One day we went There were a crazy crowd. A kid pushed several People told him: Or do you think you're Pablo Escobar?&quot; Behind, Pablo watched the scene At the same time, day and night, thousands of men The research section, the CIA, the DEA, Pablo Escobar doesn't care, he continues to taunt them - Pablo had a habit. He set up roadblocks on Las Palmas Avenue. In fact, he was waiting secret service police officers. I'm going elsewhere One evening, a policeman arrives He presents himself as Escobar recognizes him and says to him: "It was you who killed So immediately he kills the major and his girlfriend. This is Escobar's response to He is offering $2000 for each 1600 will thus fall under In the streets of Medellin, The research section barracks, becomes the theater In Escobar's crosshairs, there are also those who dream and extradite him to the United States. For the year 92 alone, 70 magistrates fell This judge who goes on an operation knows she can die Colombian newspapers do not have nor show his face. The helicopter raid takes him in the middle of the mountain range. An informant has just informed was there that morning. DEA Agent Stephen Murphy normal, for capture the Americans want to be there. But once again, - It was discouraging. We started to say to ourselves: "We'll never catch this guy." We had the best with us And yet, Failing to find Escobar, the judge and the soldiers are looking for underground. We're looking for evidence. - Which ones? Mass graves. He kills people and buries them. It's for making bombs! The shelter is full of automatic weapons, additional evidence. Pablo Escobar is still running. There had been so many operations we had lost our credibility Our leaders were beginning to doubt. There was talk of replacing us, It is the fall of 93. The Colombian government decides It triples the reward. Escobar's head is now worth $5 million. On television, campaigns listening systems Escobar is one of the few to have but he knows he must never speak for more than three minutes, to prevent the police One day, an American technician that he had information He had located a point of emission It was very difficult terrain We had prepared in the greatest secrecy. However, a few minutes later, we hear someone on the radio &quot;Sir, they have located you, On our arrival, A conclusion is necessary, a mole that warns the cartel leader of all raids. The colonel does not take long to unmask him. This informant was a young with a particularity. He was very good with his hands He sculpted small figurines He always hung out with us especially when we were focusing The informant is directly With the money, he rents an apartment just behind the barracks. As soon as this policeman learned he was running to this house. Using a coded radio, he called He spoke in secret language &quot;Tell the senior or the doctor, They arrive, When we arrived at the scene, where we came across an armed group And that's how so many police officers The traitor is eliminated. The manhunt can start again The individual we target, And according to our information, He would be hiding in this area. - Chopo was essential. He was the fireworks maker, he made This is our photo album The guy we want to catch tonight... The change in tactics is complete. The objective is now removing 1 to 1 That night, aka El Chopo. The operation against El Chopo She will be followed by many others. Executives of the Medellin cartel, fall one after the other. Pablo Escobar is weakened. - In the end, Escobar has no one left He no longer has a leader Fear then changes sides. From predator, Especially since it comes into play those persecuted by Pablo Escobar, nicknamed in Medellin, the Pepes. - The Pepes were a group of the Medellin Cartel. They parted ways with Escobar At their head, 2 formidable traffickers, 2 former accomplices of Escobar, revolted by his paranoia Unlike the police, all the habits of the cartel leader. The carnage does not take long. The Pepes murder with all their might And that changes the whole perspective He's really starting to worry In fact, the Pepes use They target the family. Like this day when they plastic his wife and children. No one is hurt, but - One day, they put a bomb that $5 million thing. Escobar's wife is devastated, so she calls Pablo. Look, they ransacked the Dali. But what are we going to do? Pablo replied: What is the Dali? these are our children, Little by little, Escobar takes and it is this love who will finally lose it, as long as they are in Colombia, he will never be at peace. So he decides more precisely in Germany. On November 27, 1993, Maria Victoria, Juan Pablo and little Manuela under police protection Escobar thinks they're out of the woods. He doesn't know it yet, just started. - His wife and children But no country wants to accept them. The plane goes back and forth and rests in Colombia. Nobody wanted to hear anymore Following diplomatic pressure, the German government On November 29, the Escobar family under the protection of the government, without imagining a single second, that they fell into a trap and the Colombian authorities. - I was sure that once rejected the family would exert pressure Upon landing, the family in a residence in Bogota They are in fact prisoners. The journalists rush. Her children are exposed to the eyes of For Escobar, the ordeal is terrible. Isolated, far from his family and now powerless to protect them. Especially since at the same time, by claiming responsibility for an attack Without causing any casualties. In his den, until you forget the rules of security. - We knew that Escobar and his son on the same frequency, that we started to intercept For the research section, All men are mobilized. On the front line, 4 vehicles They travel constantly looking for the slightest word - At this moment, throughout the search area. Our teams are on alert, in case a call is spotted. On December 1, spot 5 calls from Escobar - The problem, He had been calling since The police have just understood to avoid being spotted, the fugitive has long since adopted, a simple but effective method, roll continuously in a and have from his phones, very short conversations. - After 4 days of continuous listening, we were exhausted, we thought we wouldn't arrive When suddenly, on the fifth day, his last call is intercepted. Incredibly, the signal is fixed he is in a house. The first policeman to arrive He reports immediately And there, this policeman said to me: I identified the house, I think I see it. Yes ! He is near the window, No more doubt, the group It is led by Major Aguilar. - We entered the house The first thing we see, this is the taxi in which he was And there I hear Pablo It is located on the second floor. We start to move forward, with my rifle, Very slowly. And there I see it. He's right in front of me. But since I don't have a good So I move forward a little. He turns around and sees me. He said, "What's going on?" Then he drops his phone and goes out I run up, I shoot and hit him in the back. The policeman behind me takes He hits him here, right in the temple. The ball goes in here and comes out there. And suddenly he throws himself out of the window. I jump too. It was rough because the window I advance. I take his gun away from him. I take the radio, And I shout: "Long live Colombia! Half an hour later, are in front of the house. The whole town runs. Those who the death of Pablo Escobar. And then there are those who don't believe it, like the godfather's mother who arrives She's going to take a long time Hand on face, American agent in the crowd of soldiers. He didn't want to miss the trophy afterwards Everyone was delighted, You can't imagine the pressure Especially if we think could have missed his shot, At 1:30 p.m., this December 2, 1993, the biggest manhunt Pablo Escobar at the gates of Medellin. 10,000 people are present, in a communion In a corner, crushed by the crowd one last time. That day, a page in history But on Escobar's long run, much remains to be written. Sixteen years after the man's disappearance remains one last mystery. Where did the fortune go? Where would be hidden that legend attributes to him? - Colombian traffickers had Escobar had done it, that's for sure. I think there are some left if only because Escobar who buried the bags of dollars. The money rotted, it was buried under water. - Pablo didn't take the money, that's for sure. - All the fortune of Pablo Escobar in gold and diamonds. There was no liquid. - Money is partly the State. Partly the enemies who took it. Another part may be or maybe here. The rest has disappeared. I believe that money It is in the hands of the family. I think it's his family Because Pablo Escobar's money, no one ever has If it is true, I think he himself Even with 50% of that. His wife and children today in Argentina. These statements by General Maza, Buenos Aires, After the death of the godfather, have settled well here. But they blended in Maria Victoria Juan Pablo is now called It took us several days The Escobar family has reconverted Maria Victoria started a business in the heart of Palermo, We sit opposite - The studio, hello. - May I speak - He is not there. Do you know when he comes back? I think he's traveling. I don't know when he comes back. - Thank you so much. In the meantime, we are looking on family activities This journalist was interested When they arrive, they begin especially an accountant. At first, have a friendly relationship, And together, It was their little love nest. It's from this apartment organize money laundering. The accountant begins to do and brings back suitcases of tickets. Double bottom suitcases up to $400,000. Between 95 and 99, it has been proven that he did but we estimate that it could But Maria Victoria's love because it's money He is more and more greedy and blackmails Mrs. Escobar In 1999, there was a twist. Maria Victoria, her son, Juan Pablo and the blackmailer. Very quickly, they were released. The magistrates have never been able to prove, that their heritage came from Since then, the accountant Maria Victoria, she, Our hideout continues The days go by and look the same. On the fourth day, finally, Juan Pablo has just alerted us. He offers us a meeting. No doubt possible. In profile, The godfather's son is now 32 years old. He made a clean sweep of the past. He is now a designer married and soon to be a father. For this meeting with we decide to equip ourselves The man who tries to remake The meeting with him - What should I call you? -Sebastian. Juan Pablo, for me, That was my life before. - Where did the immense fortune go? What happened to his money? - The answer is very simple. Yes, my father was immensely rich. But I have to At one point, and he invested all his fortune And you know, in arms and men. And apart from arms spending a considerable mass to corrupt people. - He bought the whole country? - Yes, the whole country. In his office, I saw parade all kinds of important people. For example, he was in a meeting the police officers of the escort After the meeting, they passed One day, they were policemen, I even saw an ex-president He watered everyone, daddy, "Here, here's your check. In the Escobar file, Argentinian justice has finished But when you're clean impossible to escape suspicion - We were accused $1 million in five years. I answered them: &quot;If what you say is true, money launderers of history. Because when you wash $1 million is nothing. Just pocket money What happened to the billions Do they sleep in numbered accounts Or are they just a fantasy? Nobody knows, Maria Victoria, She refused to meet us. We only have these images of her She has part of the truth. Dying on a roof Pablo Escobar, the greatest has not revealed all its secrets.
