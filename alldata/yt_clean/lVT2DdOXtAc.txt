Music In today's instalment of Guild's Garage, we're going to go down and visit Tim Schmidt, take a look at his new 40,000 square foot facility and some of the toys he's been stuffing inside it. I always enjoy going to Tim Schmidt's place because, well, there's always lots of new things. He never stops. First thing is his gates. I mean, when you look either side, there's cars, there's toys all up and down in front of the property. And a recent addition to his driveway, well, two things. He's got the whole driveway lined from one end to the other with old gas station signs, which was quite the project to put all of that up. He's also creating a quarter mile drag strip out of his driveway. And soon there's going to be a Christmas tree and the whole nine yards. So you'll be able to speed up to his facilities. As usual, Tim meets me on a cool golf cart. I mean, you can't just have a golf cart. It's got to be cool. And with his dog, Hipster, who, you know, I'm not a small dog guy, but I love Hipster. We'll go for a ride in. Where'd your armored car go? Oh, it's the other building. So you never had any luck selling that, right? I didn't. It's probably hard. Yeah. I know I could have got rid of it. I know that kind of sales thing. Yeah, maybe I'll sell it. Yeah, maybe. Yeah, maybe not. I got rid of both McLaren's. And then I had, yesterday, somebody texted me a picture of my car. Then are you interested in this car? Available. The guy really wants to get out of it. I texted him back. I said, that's my old car. I like this set. Yeah, this is my white set. Your white set. The Porsche, the other Porsche. White Porsche will sit beside the other Porsche. But that's what she's driving today. Oh, look at that. Well, I like actually Fox, but you got pocket change and pocket change. Well, you're repeating yourself. Yeah, yeah. That one was a no-brainer. Yeah. Oh, and you got dropped out twice too. Yeah, that's cool. Now I got dropped out and I got dropped out. Yeah, yeah, that's good. But I'm, oh, I guess the prowl, all that other stuff is in the new building. Yeah. Well, that's nice because it frees up this. I want to do a lot of the stuff that I got on the walls and stuff. I'm going to bring it close to the glass here. So you can see it better. Yeah. Yeah, because, I mean, you sort of forget, well, I mean, you're so busy looking. This is such a beautiful building. Now when you are building something like this, are you basically throwing ideas to anybody? So are you basically involved in the design, like right from the get go? I tell them what I want. You tell them exactly what you want. I'll do, okay, now, here, I want to do this to this building. I want to do that to that building. Yeah. So really, you're just realizing your design. Yeah. Getting involved of big time. Yeah, well, I saw that with the cars. I mean, because you get a car and when you finished with it, you've actually, a lot of people, when they get a car, they change it for the sake of changing it and they don't improve it and quite often they make it worse. Right. Right? I mean, that's the majority. But whenever I've seen something that you've done, sometimes it even looks stock, but not stock, if you know what I mean. Like it looks like properly designed in the whole bit. So you've got a really, yeah, you've got a really good feel for design. There's no doubt about that. And then you get the haters, right? Oh. There's a lot of haters out there. Yeah. Well, you know what? What can you do? I didn't build it for them. I built it for me. And you know what? I feel good when I drive that car. Yeah. Well, I think that you'll find that people who are haters are generally people who are just so jealous that that's the only way they can express it. Yeah. Right? And you just discount them. I do. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's the best attitude. Yeah. Piss on that. Well, not finished. It'll never be finished. It's never. There's always going to be room for another car. Well, yeah. Yeah. See, tomorrow I'm getting, I don't know, a bunch of stuff I bought from the auction. Yeah. Getting dropped off. Well, now you got to fill this building up again, too. Yeah, I do. And I don't. I know. If I do my show again, I think I'm only going to open like two buildings. Uh-huh. Three. And even though I'm going to even open this, you probably don't need to open this one. If you got more, the more modern. And put them in the other one. Yeah. I and push to park them outside. And then you don't have to worry about it. Well, you have to worry about the cars when you got them parked outside when they're not, you don't have one person looking after each car. But then what I do is outside. What I do is I just rope them all up. Yeah. Well, show me the world of the new building. Let's go. Show me what you've done. Frank is done. What Frank is done? Frank placed everything that's in that building. Frank is placed. He's my curator. He's the guy that looks off to the building. I get something new. He'll be the guy that places it in there. So now we've seen Tim's original garage. We're going to take a look at a few of the other things on the property before we go to the main event. Nobody will ever suspect. No. This is my quit smoking cigarettes. That's the main thing. Yeah. My doctor said you can smoke marijuana. After I quit smoking for three weeks, I get to the doctor and I said, you know, I haven't had a cigarette or a joint for three weeks. I smoked a joint. Oh hell, you could have smoked a joint three weeks ago. What? Well, you don't smoke as many of those as you do cigarettes. So fuck it. We smoked them two and a half packs a day. Yeah. So that's... Well, you could, but well, no, you can't because you'll end up on your back and unconscious. So Tim's got this busy buddy neighbor that drives him crazy. Every time Tim does something, this guy tries to get in the mix to the point where he's even sent drones up over Tim's property, which apparently Tim knocks down. One of the things Tim's done that really bugs the guy is he's installed this huge church bell and he brings it at different times of the day. I think that's pretty funny. And I'm willing to help Tim out anytime he needs help like this. Yeah. I'm going to ring the bell and hopefully we can annoy the neighbor. I hope you do. I hope it pisses him right off. Yeah. Anything I can do to help. All right. Perfect. That annoyed me. You can bother me. Yeah. So what I'm doing is with this, I've got a drill. An oil drill? Uh-huh. It goes like this? Yeah. We're going to hook it up so I can get on my phone and just do it. Let's do it. Perfect. That annoyed me. You can bother me. Yeah. So what I'm doing is with this, I've got a drill. An oil drill? Uh-huh. It goes like this? Yeah. I'm going to do it. Just do it. I automatically ring the bell. She's going to be Wi-Fi. The building's all the Wi-Fi. All the building got Wi-Fi, so. Yeah. Like an old air raid siren too. Because he might find that annoying. Oh, I know. Yeah. You might get in trouble with an air raid siren. No. They won't know where it's coming from. Yeah. No. Nobody would suspect where it was coming from, especially the neighbor. No. Yeah. That building used to look so big, eh? Oh, yeah. It did too. They know now you come out and you look. I think this one's 180 feet long. Mm-hmm. That one's four. And so the other one's like twice the size. Absolutely. This is a little workshop. Oh, Jeff, my sister just took off. Oh, is that a Thames? Yeah. Thames, 1949 Thames. Eh. It's kind of an oil leak. You know, an oil leak was coming from the timing chain cover. So he just did all that. He's basically ready to start. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Excuse me. I had the car for 61 years. Oh, is that right? Yeah. And it looked just like this when he had it, right? Well, I don't know. No. No. He learned how to drive in it, though. Is that right? You guys are like 75 or something like that? This is cool because I mean, when I was a kid, there was all, not all kinds of these, but there was a lot of these and they were turned into hot rods and a lot of them were being drag race thieves and the feats, the tiny little. Yeah. Topolino, like what's on the wall? There's one on the wall over there. Oh, okay. I have a topolino, I think the car was called. I've almost bought one several times. I'm so tempted every time I see one and I've never pulled the trigger because it's always been, you know, one was in Atlanta and another one is Southern California and say, and I go, oh, yeah, I buy it. Now I got to get it home and, you know. Ryan, give me a favor, open the other garage door over there. Yeah. The other, yeah, the middle. No, the other one on the other side. Yeah. Nice interior, too. That's a nice little truck. I put a proxy bid on it and sure enough, the guy calls me, you got a car. Oh, really? Nobody wanted it from what I have. Have you driven it? No, are you just kidding? Oh, yeah, no, no, no, I've driven it a few times. Yeah. That's what I found out about the, the oil leak. That's the Shelby. Yeah. Have you driven the Camaro up there lately? No. I was debating whether I should take that motor out of there because there's a good Stout motor 427 in there. Yeah. With a good tranny. You got a mini up here. I thought about putting a big motor with the big blower on the front of this one. Uh-huh. That's a right hand drive, too. All right. So you used to have more cars up in here than this, eh? No, just two. On the shoves of these two? Just these two. Yeah. So why did you put the Camaro up there? I'll ride it around the back. Oh, okay. So I said, you know what? No, do it. You're not going to bother. No. No. Because we do, that's what we do now. I mean, I'm doing 20s and 30s cars. It's all Camaro's up. And I mean, they're so badly made. I mean, and you end up sinking so much. It's a quarter million dollars these days to do what we used to do for 50. I know. You know? I know, it's crazy. Mind you, people, when it used to be 50 grand, people were making 12 bucks an hour, and now they're not. Right. And that's new-ish, eh? Yeah, that's new-ish. And it still got the push button to, that was such a cool idea. I thought it was, too. Yeah, didn't always work well, but. This is the one I want to go look at now. I like that. 58? 59. Good night. So look at this. Swivel seats. Yeah. I remember those. What else? Those are a few cars. And it's got air conditioning. It's got a 360. I think it's a 360 in it. I had 18 with the guy, and he's still saying no. I just let it ride. It's some car company that has it. So what you got doing next door? Where? In here? Oh, I was going to show you all that glass. I just got okayed for my extension on my toy room. Oh, is that right? Yeah. You do know that that's not really a toy room. Yeah. It's a building. Yeah, toy building. Oh. These aren't mine. This has changed. Oh, okay. These four and those six in there belong to a buddy of mine. His unit's being built right now. So they need somewhere to store it. And I said, well, I got some space. I got another buddy of mine that owns Mobile. I think it's an old Zerobile. And that's your Viper? Yeah, that's the 98. Yeah. Got a big supercharger on it. It was a 1,000 horse car at one time. Yeah. So what are you going to do with the toy room? Put more toys in it. No, but I mean like what it says. It's going to be instead of an L-shaped building, it'll be a square building. Yeah. Do we take a quick look? Sure, sure. All right. Oh, no, I can't. You can't have my keys. I got to find something. Oh, okay. Well, don't worry about it. Greg! You got your keys for the toy room? Look at that. He just answers from the sky? Yeah. Yeah, how did he hear you? He heard me. Holy shit, he's got really good hearing. Yeah. Go ahead and make your day. All right, I'll just take you for a quick walk, sir. Here's the toy room. After coming to Thames, it sort of knocks the wind out of your sails and you think, well, maybe I would like to collect hot wheels. And then you see this and you go, well, what is the point? It's been done. I mean, it's really been done. Even up on the ceiling. So the cars aren't here, but that really opens this up because you keep your parents' cars in here. Yeah. Yeah. You know, that opened this up big time. Yeah. Somebody actually priestly, priestly. Vic priestly, yeah. Yeah, Victor, I bought a lot of that. Probably that whole shelf after that, a lot of this stuff I bought from him. Did he sell you his dinky toys? He wants to. He still wants this. Still, I got to go back and see him. His dinky toys. I mean, he started collecting those dinky toys when he was a little kid. You got to see some of the stamp metal shit that he's got. Yeah. I know. He was just like probably half a million dollars in the stamp metal stuff. Probably 40 years ago, he showed me his dinky toy collection, which he had in bags and boxes up in the rafters of a garage he had at his old place. Right? Because he was my landlord for a while when I was over on the western road. Oh, yeah? He still had the first piece of construction equipment he ever bought when he was like eight years old. Really? Yeah. He asked me if I wanted to buy his tractor collection. How many has he got? A few. Yeah? Well, I know he sort of dropped it aside because when I was collecting, when my safe came up, I really sort of thought that I had some pretty rare pieces. When I started selling them, I thought Vic would be there for sure and he didn't turn up, so I was really surprised at that. I guess he's stopped collecting. Yeah, he stopped. Yeah. He's getting old. Yeah, well, that's what happens. You don't point where you go, oh my god, it's just so much maintenance. The kids don't want the stuff anymore. Well, that's true, so they don't know. They don't know what it is. I know. If you've got a stick car, they can hardly fucking steal a fucking stick car. Kids don't know how to steal a fucking stick car. So that's the lesson is, always buy some with a force feed and a clutch. You leave the keys in it and it ain't going to get stolen. You know what, of all of your gas station signs, which I just like, the frontier, that rare to go. Yeah, that one, that's one of the rarest. I think that's one of my most expensive ones. The Exxon with the tiger, because when I was a kid, nearly 60s, that was the big thing, that put a tiger in your tank. Yep, exactly, it was. And that was ESO. ESO, exactly. Exxon was the American version. But that's Sinclair because I always love dinosaurs. I know. And to get the one, did you get it with the dinosaur on top? Yeah, no, no, I bought it with the dinosaur on top. My favorite recollection of gas stations when I was a kid was, there was a white rose station in Richmond Hill. And the reason I remember it so vividly is, it was built like a little castle. And it just served gas. There was no gas, there was no service there. But it looked like this little castle with two white turrets and red roofs on it. They had one of those down on the lake shore, right across when you get off the gardener there, right across the street there. I think what they've done with that old gas station, they moved it across the street. It was a historical thing then. Yeah, well they tore the one in Richmond Hill down to build Don Little Ford, which was a shame. And they should have left it there. Now people would. Well, little guy, quarter to one. Oh, we got lunch then. Let's go for breakfast or lunch. All right, let's do that. So, you know, we've seen the original garage and we've seen some of the rest of Tim's property. And, you know, we're going to go to the main building. But for some reason, I seem to have the munchies. I have no idea why. Falling in the night, we're going to get in the Audi. What are you going to do with little guy? He's coming with us. Ah. You a tired boy? You tired? Yeah. We did get. Remember the drawing? Oh, tell me about it. But I mean, but I'll tell you. There's one good identifier. Yeah. There's a tip. To be completely incognito, all you have to do is that. You're going to get a car, can't you? Yeah. Superman. Yeah, you know. Right? We can't see them. We don't know who I am. Superman. Yeah. I want to use that car. Let's not work. Oh, I get that almost. Yeah. By the time I fix them, I don't want to drive them anymore. I know, I'm the same way. Yeah. I just finished fixing the, uh, no, I went to bull. So now you've been on a quick tour of Tim's original garage and some of the property and other buildings. Well, we're going to get to the main event, the new 40,000 square foot building. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. And you have 15 minutes now t ` y I think that's more original than that. Yeah. That looks sort of because I remember it as a kid. Yeah. You know that, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay? I've still smoked here, Jones? It's alright. Still bits easily. It's still smoky in your lungs. Yeah. Yeah. My neon guy died. Oh, is that right? Yeah. Oh. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. You got a new plate for that already. Happy Hemi, happy wagon. Have you run out of happy stuff? Yeah. No, I can add on both sides. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, great. Okay. Okay, great. Great. Okay. Okay. So that's what we're going to do. Okay. All right, let's go. Let's go. All right. So, you got a new plate for that? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. The next thing. D Nik who's the dog handler? Sorry. Sorry. Dpay. Oh, okay. All right. Okay. Okay. All right. Then if I can set up what container up. That's nice because it's completely just like, yeah. Into this whole tent? Absolutely. Because I love the, yeah. Can see this whole container? Yeah. So for the shopping where I bought school load of $500. Of course I've got 500 bucks that is tough. Have you had the boat in the water? No, I couldn't even do the boat. Because if I'm going to put the boat in the water, I want to at least be able to walk to the dock. Yeah. And be able to get on my boat and walk to the back of my boat, back to the front of my boat, you know, be able to jump in the water. Yeah. So I said, you know what, this week, I'll just leave it inside. Just put a crane on the side of the boat, sling it. Yeah. You know, throw it out, dump it in. I don't want to do it, but it's just, I know it's just because I'm painting you. I don't want to take my walk around the goddamn boat on the boat. No, I don't understand that. So. How's the girl? She's good. She went to a shared dentist appointment this morning. Yeah, what a lovely day. We've been lucky. What do you need? Okay. Want to do a quick little camera. See if it'll work. Vertical or horizontal? Probably horizontal, but it's just a. Heck, you know what? I do have my tripod upstairs. I got a selfie stick tripod. Stick it in. Yeah, it's all right. I think we'll be able to make this work. Yeah. Don't know for sure how well, how well the angle is. This is like GoPro's, but without the go where the problem. Right. You got to start saying these things and I'm holding the camera. I just widened the angle a little bit. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. All right. We'll have to. See about that. I guess. I think it honestly makes it kind of organic and. Yeah. I think it's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit. I think it honestly makes it kind of organic and kind of funny. Okay. Yeah. So. Just going to ring it for you. Okay. What's up? No one. That's beautiful. It's ready to ring you. Oh, Yeah, you're gonna see if we even bother the neighbor. Hi, David. Hello there. My name is Mike.
