It's a lot easier without them. Do you have to, like? I used to braid them and, throw it over my shoulders or, Yeah, but I would go to events and it would just. I would just not eat because I was like. I just felt ridiculous. Yeah. You're like. You know, it's like. Yeah, it's too much. Hamstrung by the tassels. Yes, exactly. I get it. That's happened to me.

Okay, throughout today's game, Orville's favorite foods mid, Each round, and by the end, And up first, this is spaghetti bolognese. This is spaghetti bolognese. This is your jam, huh? This is my jam. I love spaghetti bolognese. But, you know, this is interesting because. I'm listening. Go ahead. I feel that I'm curious about the outcome because good Italian food is oftentimes not fancy. Not fancy, right. You know what I mean? Something like this, Yeah. I'm surprised I could find Yeah, it takes some. It takes some. How do you do this, dude? I mean, it's. Maybe it's. Well, because he doesn't have glasses. Glasses are really. That would be a tricky. Imagine I had glasses and did that. What I need is I just need Contact lenses or something. Oh, no, not. No. What could we use? If you could invent something. Yeah. Now we're onto something. Yeah. Will you be my optometrist? I could be. You're a genius. I could be. The first one was not. I don't know. I feel like it's missing if I'm being honest. Yeah, I agree. Not particularly great. Yeah. This one's redder. This one is redder. What else? Let's taste. Well, immediately, there's more garlic. Yep. And that's nice. There's a lot more flavor in this. Yeah. I can't do this anymore. I don't know how. I mean. How do you do it? Well, I can't be the only one. This is such a specific reference. But, you know, like, if you're playing with like, put its face in your hands and, peel back its ears. Because you're like. You're the cutest. You're so cute. And it's like, eyes get. Yeah. Yes. That's kind of what Rhett to me. Okay. I love doing that to animals. You're gonna have to go back Because I'm not doing it now. Why do we? Just rewind. So the second one is good. This is good. First one. First one's a little busted. Do you like your meat mixed into your noodles? Yeah. Like, you see this? This is odd a little to me? Because this looks like mini Right? It's, like, meatballs that got cut up. Like, I kind of think it needs. For me, it needs to be a bit more mixed in, maybe, but let's take a look. I one hundred percent believe in the mix. Like, if you have some leftover. Yeah. Like, if you make it at home and you got the you put it away for the next day, do you mix it and put it away? No. I do. You do? What's so wrong with that? It brings me back to my lunch lady days. Ooh, this is. Well, I wasn't a lunch lady. He had a career as a lunch lady. I mean, that's what it sounded like. Well, tasted like. What am I saying? Sorry, but. I can't think when you have a mask on. When you. Now his mask. Yeah, you're the problem now. I don't know about this. I don't know. I have a favorite. Yeah, me too. You ready to stab? Yeah. Yep, I think so. Three, two, one. So we all agree? Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's definitely the best. But I don't know if that like, right? Right. Well, it is, in fact, the mid price point from La Bella The first one that seemed love it necessarily, that's the fancy one from Madeo And then the low price point was for thirteen ninety-five. Yeah. They have a deli. I've been to their deli. Yeah. This sort of tasted like a microwave meal. Yep. Not great. Not great. But why is that one the? Because Italian food's not fancy. Okay. In my opinion. There it is. We're just talking pasta Like, it doesn't have to be Yeah. No, the best Italian food I've like a hole in the wall. Like, you know, place. Like mid. Just like we did. Mid. We love mid. We love mid. We love mid around here. This is chicken banh mi. This is chicken banh mi. Okay, so this is a go to for you. We're starting with that. Yes Okay. Okay. Here, would you like? Thank you. They all are very different from one another. Okay, Link, I don't wanna alarm you, It does, look. Where it's got all the stuff on one side. He doesn't like that. With the bread on the back. You like the ratio all the way through. Yeah. yeah, yeah. One time, he got so mad at Jimmy From Jimmy John himself? We didn't tell him about the letter. I don't know about the letter. I'm making that part up. Okay. Wait, is his name Jimmy John? I think it's two guys. We're supposed to know, Yeah, we don't even. They didn't make this, I'll tell you that. It's not bad. It's pretty classic. Because a lot of times they but this. The French roll is little hard. That's sort of. Okay, this is what I think is As you can see. That's like a ciabatta. No? Right. Yep. Can it be a banh mi if it's not? I think the whole. I might be wrong here, but I believe the whole like, occupation in Vietnam. And, like, that's where the baguette thing comes from. Yeah, this is a. Which is weird. Somebody's taking some liberties. Yeah. This is like someone's mom made didn't have a French baguette. But it might be the reason Maybe, maybe. That's true. Just mixing it up. Ciabatta banh mi. I can't make it work. I do like the soft bread. I'm not hearing any crustiness of bread sound. Yeah, this is a soft bread. Double, double soft? The stuff inside is still crunchy. This one is. Also, but that doesn't taste like a banh mi. No, it's got a different taste. It's got so much mayo, which is. Way too much mayonnaise. So mayo. It's a little spicy. I like that. Something's really missing from that. I think. This is really. Big. Yeah. Fried. That doesn't look like a banh mi. Why are they all so weird? It looks like a sesame Do you want? You want the middle piece? Let's do that. Get the middle. Oh, okay, good. Do you ever fall asleep in your mask, I have a sleep mask. Yeah. That is so cool. No. I never take it off, ever. I know you don't. I don't even know how to get. How to tackle this. Yeah, this is gonna be messy. We were talking before, and we were trying to figure out if you might be the first person who's together since We Are The World. He got Elton John and and then Beck and Diplo. I mean, how did that happen? I don't know. You bribed them with banh mi? You know what's crazy is I knew pretty much everyone on which is so insane to say. That's cool. So it made it easy, I find then, like, like, Right. You know, like, you can just. Call up Willie and Elton and just say yo. Pretty much, just really wild. That is pretty cool. Unlike this sandwich. That's also not a banh mi. No. In my mind. Oh, put it over here because I feel like if the inside of one was in the outside of three, it would. Exactly. The bread on three is good. You're right. The bread. Exactly. This is the most banh mi tasting, Yeah, for sure. This is, like, not. That's an abomination. &quot;A-banh mi-nation&quot;. There you go. Now we found it. All right, we ready to vote? We got it. &quot;A-banh mi-nation&quot;. Three, two, one. You know what? I like mayo. Sorry, guys. I'm not a big banh mi fan. He's a big mayo fan. Does that surprise you? Rhett and Orville, you chose again the mid option. Okay, we'll take it. From O Banh Mi for sixteen dollars. I don't know how, but, Link, you've chosen what is the fancy. Yes, of course. From Feu Pho Kitchen for nineteen dollars. Watch out now. What'd you call it? Feu Pho. F, not F. Yeah, but then you said kitchen. And you said kitchen real quick. Feu Pho Kitchen. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And so that means that you get to do with our special guest. I'm asking you to do Please. Oh, God. Oh, God. Do I do it, too? No? No, you didn't earn it. We watch it. Only he gets to do it. Okay. Yeah. Okay, yeah. Yeah. That look on his face is scary. That's the part that's really intriguing. I can do anything. Yeah. I can be a superstar countryman. I can sing with a booming voice and collab with Elton John. Hey, Link. I thought that was great. It was beautiful. But just because you put the mask on doesn't give you all those superpowers. Okay? I get it now. Now you see. I get it now. I know, you. I get it now. It's a dangerous power. Okay. That was an interesting Yeah, it was weird. But that's okay. The last one with good bread is our low eight ninety-five Yeah, that was. That's Mama Hong's? Mama Hong usually brings it. Yeah, Mama Hong's got some good stuff. Mama Hong takes the, like, leftover spicy sesame chicken and That's exactly. Let's just call it what it is, I think. We'll call her. Yeah, call her. Let's call her. This is doro wat and injera. This is doro wat and injera. So. Okay. Have you had this before? I have. I've heard of it, kind of, almost. What do I do? Well, you take the injera, which is like. It's like a sort of sour, savory pancake, to get. Yes, yes, yes. The. Whatever you want here they have. Start with that one. Let's start with that one. Oh, got it, got it, got it. It's the utensil. Yes. Yes. All right. That's a whole chicken leg right there. So you're basically making a little. And you make yourself a little guy, This is fun. Drop it in your lap if you have. It's good. Oh, come. Why are you got to ruin? Well, it's over there. Let's see how you do when it's over here. Well, I'm not gonna do that. It's the mask. I can't see. He's got too much power. You try to take him to a nice place. Okay. This is good. I like it. This is a little sweeter than I'm used to. Yep. Okay. You know what I'm saying? So this is kind of like. It's crepe-ish. Yeah, it's crepe-ish for sure. And everybody's eating off the same stuff. The whole, like. The table is. I like sharing. Is the pancake stuff. Let me get. Let me just get. I got a lot, but I'll eat it. It tastes like it's been cooking for days. In a good way. Yeah, we like that. And then the egg, like, Try the egg. Well, everybody. All right, now let's watch what I do here. Yeah, exactly. Don't get it further away. Well, that's where. That's where it was. No, it's not. It's right here. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Look, look, you're really putting him out. I mean, don't lean over a guest like that. Do you guys have matching rings? Yeah. Yeah, we do. Are they like friendship rings? Well. Are you married? Well, we're married to our wives. We have a committed friendship. I love that. This, it. Did you get me one? It monitors our. It's a fitness ring. It monitors our vitals. Couldn't you tell?

It's our low price point option And the last one is our fancy option from Messob for thirty-two eighty-three. Okay, so none of these were the one that you've been. There's not many of these in town. No. But, if you go to little Ethiopia, there's a few just right there. They're really good. Highly recommended. It's probably the most unique most unlike anything else. Yeah. And it's fun.

Project. You can project like no one else. Yeah. Yeah. I should do like, they do those, hollering contests. That's what I should. I should quit my career and just do that full time. But the only thing we're testing is That's a better hollering. This sounds like a Good Mythical Morning. Right. Yeah. Test that you need to figure out. I don't think the building is big enough. We're gonna put you in Nevada have a one way conversation. I like the cake more, That's not cream cheese icing. No. You can you see how orange and zesty looking this one is? More carroty. That's, more carrot cake, This is, like, not as much spice going on. Maybe. This one is dark. Oh, that might be nice. It has some darkness to it. Is that two different kinds or is that just? Oh, no, that's a big thing of icing. Big thing of icing. This looks good, I think. Okay. Oh, -Christmas. Yes. Tastes like Christmas. That one tastes. That one tastes like brandy.
