&quot;Go even harder!&quot; That's Atlas, the super famous robot in these incredible videos from Boston Dynamics. hard as I possibly can. And then, to be fair, I'm Atlas for a little friendly competition to see question that I've had since I was a kid: When and Sonny from &quot;I, Robot&quot; and The Iron Giant. The human- can by ourselves... as long as they don't try and have seemed pretty far away. But recently? Not a bunch of startups are all making huge leaps take you to the cutting edge of humanoid robots and what you can expect in &quot;Humanoid robots...&quot; &quot;imitation of life...&quot; &quot;machines that resemble people &quot;robots playing a larger role in our lives&quot; &quot;how do we prevent robots and humans &quot;How do I look? Great let's do this.&quot; I've wanted to meet Atlas for years. I'm one of who have watched this robot on YouTube. I've been trying for months and I just tweeted asking anyone who watches this able to connect to the right people and finally I get to be here. Thank you for making &quot;I'm so excited to be here. &quot;We're excited to have you. This is the Atlas lab. &quot;I do! Very much. Can I meet Atlas for the first time?&quot; &quot;Do you still feel this way &quot;Every day, I love this robot.&quot; The reason that I wanted to meet Atlas so badly is many companies to build machines that resemble and can do some of the same things that we can and Atlas, you can understand what's really happening some anatomy. &quot;Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes,&quot; but this is what the world looks like to it. Atlas's &quot;Atlas has three computers inside of its torso. Each Also, Atlas was kind of... short. &quot;I didn't realize that I would be taller than Atlas! This version of Atlas is 4' 11 inches or height of the average American 12-year-old. Early versions though were just scarier. It's easier a middle schooler. No one's ever seen the most standing next to each other but based on their Atlas. Here's me at 5'9. Tesla's Optimus robot the cute old Honda Asimo is little just 4'3. And to these companies though was: Why? Why build a kinds of other shapes. Why are we working so hard to this: We built our world for humans. &quot;So if you're interested in building address the current limitations in automation, a Companies are building these robots to first do things like some kinds of manufacturing or That's why legs specifically are so important... &quot;So many of the robots that people a more automated delivery system, &quot;For me, legs are about access. The opportunity to go more places is just better. So a floor like this but that can go upstairs, climb can take it into a crumbling building...&quot; Or in the case of NASA's Valkyrie into space! Talk about uncertain terrain... &quot;Why not add something humans &quot;You have to think about what the function of a tail forces on the robot that would be significant...&quot; &quot;I'm just thinking about all the things &quot;I wanted wings also. Is &quot;That would be pretty sweet, um...&quot; [CRICKETS] &quot;Yeah maybe.&quot; Yeah, that's a no. I gotta ask the questions! it's valuable for robots to have have legs and Ready? Let's go. First up: running. Jumping? We can both do that... And also this... Or rolling... gotta say, The grand finale... Show-off. &quot;Do a backflip!&quot; [ATTEMPT] &quot;Nope! There's no way.&quot; &quot;Jesus Christ. That's Jason Borne.&quot; Yeah! No! I can't do a standing backflip. But... hang on... if Atlas can do a why can't it beat me at something as simple &quot;Have you ever heard of Moravec's Paradox?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;It's a principle that's often easy things are hard. So basically we move through the world world and interact with exactly the things that are When you see a person do something make assumptions about what else they can do. If they can do a backflip, they must be able Don't do that for robots! &quot;So if I see a person for example that goes in the top left corner probably assume that that person is really good do that those other things might not be true at all!&quot; Atlas can do a backflip &quot;Humanoids don't sit in chairs. And very hard to write a a general control system of time and worked on them, I'm sure we really simple, low performance, all day long that would be a real So far though, Atlas and I have what about when something unexpected some mean YouTuber coming to shove you over? &quot;I feel guilty already. Where do I shove it?&quot; &quot;You can shove it right in &quot;Stop, really?&quot; &quot;Wow!&quot; &quot;I'm shoving it hard too...&quot; &quot;Go even harder!&quot; &quot;Seriously?&quot; &quot;Yeah!&quot; &quot;I can't!&quot; &quot;Wow. I'm actually trying. to try one more time and then I'll &quot;Wow... I'm so sorry.&quot; If the robots do ever take over, we're happened. Okay? Okay. And besides, in my defense, the same way that I shoved Atlas... &quot;Would you push me in the chest?&quot; &quot;I'm serious. I want to be in Listen, fair's fair. But not in the head, You can see that I recover too in almost pushed back way farther so I'd say Atlas wins this interest. How does a robot handle adversity? Like fell unexpectedly on its side and it seamlessly the poor robots blocks around, and it just keeps felt so bad for it. Like don't move the poor robots And I felt so guilty for pushing Atlas too... &quot;Like I actually feel guilt. I feel something when I push a humanoid robot.&quot; &quot;I think there's just going to be a big as these systems start to make Obviously I know that Atlas is not a person. respond differently to robots that look like us as one of the things that I think is most interesting if they look more like us they must be and think when I see Atlas throw a bag on YouTube has a movement of each limb? Or have they said, &quot;get this could they just say, &quot;We're building a house. Help do? That might be the future, but the answer right &quot;Get this from here to here.&quot; &quot;The way that we command the robot want this bag to end up over there. You get to hold a 180. So it has to figure out, okay how do I grab so that when I let it go it follows Newton's laws coordination is really complicated right?&quot; For you as a person, this doesn't &quot;And then you're going to jump and turn 180 &quot;Okay... everybody... beware. That way.&quot; &quot;Wow, that's heavier when I... &quot;Turns out I can't do that as high as I thought.&quot; As you noticed, when you did a 180 without the bag you did it perfectly, right? As soon as you is the inertia of this bag coupled with your body in order to get all the way around right and the &quot;This is making me more impressed with the my brain is doing. And I'm appreciating my Recreating human-like movement in a robot is just you're learning from every new &quot;When I'm shoving Atlas as hard as possible, would someone need to change Atlas's &quot;Yeah right now we're not automatically using so any improvement that comes from hardware Okay so Atlas isn't learning from every new &quot;How much is Atlas currently using &quot;So when people say &quot;AI,&quot; they're usually through a process of machine learning...&quot; Machine learning boils down to of inputs and outputs and allowing it to figure &quot;And so Atlas's perception system for example this point. So it frequently uses cameras in order to localize itself to its surroundings. There's more responsible for generating behavior. thinking carefully about you know the physics of that problem, you actually use simulation and error experience in order for the system to Based on its demo videos, Tesla appears to be heavily these blocks &quot;fully autonomously,&quot; what they seem to mean here and green blocks here&quot; the robot can then use system, that runs inside the robot to process how to accomplish this task. Tesla also seems to be tasks better. Frankly it's hard from these videos I'd love to visit Tesla and find out! The robot our lives helping us do daily tasks, will depend on high level concepts and commands. If you want a massive difference between &quot;rotate your left on the counter, then take your left hand and open...&quot; understand not just &quot;where are my hands?&quot; but &quot;what out the window&quot; and also other things remain more groceries at all cost! Don't step on my dog! you realize how difficult making one actually is, and also how amazing human bodies are. But as question will become more urgent: &quot;Killer robots&quot; &quot;Will robots take over the world?&quot; &quot;The global robot takeover is coming!&quot; Boston Dynamics has issued a should be weaponized.&quot; I asked them about that. &quot;One of the things that I'm proud of at this company is against weaponization of robots, collaborating with legislation that would explicitly ban the creation It seems like Elon Musk has a similar stance on this. history and Hollywood are any indication not all be an ongoing conversation within these &quot;I think many of us on this team are are looking for world. Basically allowing people to decide long-term that we don't want to do we can have machines There are robots around us already, all the time. humanoid robots are inherently different. look like us fundamentally changes are more scary and more lovable because they're is one of the most ambitious and endearingly It's a creation in our own image. There is a &quot;huge if true&quot; among us, helping us by doing things that we do and doing things that we can't, like running into on the moon. Hundreds of people are are working they succeed, we're going to need to think about want to do - and what do we want to give up? We have but the robot future is coming and it's up to us Hold on... I have one more thing... For this whole video we were what about robots that look... like dogs? Oh thank dogs and you definitely want to see that video
