Presenting the automatic pen. Oh, wow! How does it work, Billy? Oh! You really are a genius, Billy. Cowy! [music] One. Two. Three. Four. Five. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five! [music] -Baby Bot. [exhale] -Father... I am alive! I am ali... [crash] [laughter] [crash] -I've got it. -[chirping] -Oh, sorry Billy. We didn't mean to tip over your machine. -[chirping] [futuristic music] [mechanical sounds] -What is that? -It's a robot, just like you, Baby Bot. -Like me? -[chirping] -Yes! What do you think you are, Baby Bot? -A cow? A chick? -Don't you know that you are a robot? -I know nothing. -He doesn't know he's a robot. -[chirping] -But I can learn. -And we can help you. [beep] -Hello, Billy. Greetings, Cowie. Good afternoon, Baby Bot. It is good to see you. -[chirping] -Oops, sorry, Billy. Launching translation. -[chirping] -You come from a long line of robots, Baby Bot, each designed to do different things. Behold, this is one of the first robots, called an automaton. It was made of metal and powered by steam, which made it super strong. [mechanical sounds] [steam] -[giggling] [steam] -Yay. -[chirping] -Automatons could only do one thing at a time, but not for long. -[chooo!] -Soon, robots became more advanced, like this arm bot, that builds cars. -[running] [tripping] Oh. [mechanical sounds] -[giggling] -[chirping] -[giggling] -Eventually, robots were able to go through complex obstacle courses. [running] [cheering] [running] [crashing] [buzz] -[giggling] [mechanical sounds] [sad music] -[sighs] [door opening] -And last but not least, the best of the best, the creme of the crop, the greatest robot in history. This robot can laugh and dance. -I can do that. -And sing. -[gasps] I can do that too. -And love. -[giggling] -[gasps] I am the best robot? -Of course, you are, Baby Bot. -Me? -[chirping] [kiss] -How touching. -We made you with love. -Wow. Yay. [laughing] . [tap dancing] La, la, la. La, la, la, la, la. -Beautiful. [applause] [cheering] Row, row, row your boat. Gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily. Life is but a dream. Float, float, float your blimp. Up above the trees. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily. Feel the gentle breeze. Choo, choo, choo your train. Up and down the hills. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily. Life is such a thrill. Zoom, zoom, zoom your jet. Flying high and free. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily. Life is but a dream.

I love you potato. You're the best thing in the world. My lovely, lovely potato. Rock? In kitchen? No, no, no, no, no. No! Potato! Why did you do that? No rock in the kitchen. Rock? This is a potato. And a very beautiful one. Beautiful? [laughs] Rock. Don't listen to him, potato. You are wonderful. Can you believe him? He thinks this beautiful potato is a rock. Don't you know potatoes at all? I know nothing. Ah, of course. Forgot about that. Come, Baby Bot. No. I will take you to the amazing world of potatoes. [music] Potatoes are tubers. A tuber is a large type of underground stem, where some plants gather and store the nutrients they need. You see now, it's a potato! [music] Rock. What? No. Potatoes are not rocks. They're awesome. Listen up. There are more than 4,000 different kind of potatoes. Check out the Yukon Gold, the Bintje, the cachelos. Some are tiny, some are big, some are purple, but never green. Potato! Rock! No, no. Look, they come from South America, and because they are so great, now people all over the world love them. You see me now, they're potatoes! Rock. Potato. Rock. Potato! Rock! Potato, potato, potato! Rock, rock, rock! No! How can I explain it to this hard-headed robot? Oh, of course! I forgot to tell you the most important thing about potatoes. They are delicious. Rocks? Delicious? Oh, yes. They are the best food in the world. Let me show you. Mashed potatoes. Gnocchi. Spanish tortilla. Wow! I know potatoes! Potatoes no rock. Elliot is right. I know. Potato good. My potato! Potato amazing. Potato, potato. Delicious. Great potato! And now, rock... ...and Roll! [music] Baby Bot. [music] Good morning. Morning. [music] [sings]. Hi, Billy! Oh! What's that?! Why is the lady crying, Billy? Is she hurt?! [shushes across the audience] Ma'am, are you okay?! Don't cry. Do you want to play? I have a ball. You are ruining the opera. Can't you keep quiet and let us enjoy the music? Music? What is music? Don't you know anything about music? I know nothing! but I can learn. Machines can't learn music. [music] What's wrong, Baby Bot? The man says I can't learn music because I'm a machine. No way. You're not a machine, you're Baby Bot. [smooches] Do you want me to teach you everything I know about music? Yes. Music is so rad. It makes you relax or it makes you want to dance. It can make you happy or it can make you sad. Music is amazing and this is the reason why. [drums] Samba, my favorite style to dance to. [music] Sometimes, I like wilder music like rock. [music] Yes, that was fun! And now, get ready for some classical music. [music] [applause] Wow. There are even more types of music, Baby Bot. From polka to techno. From flamenco to jazz, and there are many, many more. What's your favorite? All of them. I know music. I know music, I do. Billy! I know music!! Music. A-One. A-two. A-one, two, three, four. [music] [drums] [drums] [cheering] [music] Code Masters! Code Masters! If you talk to your computer, you communicate in code. It's no secret - ask a coder! Applications do what they're told. Let's start to code, now! One o one, yeah! It's time to develop a program. It's fun, yes, you will know. Algorithms got the rhythm. With A.I. the digits flow. Because we are, Code Masters! Code Masters! Code Masters! Code Masters! Sometimes, in the world of coding, errors called bugs slow you down, that's when you have trouble loading, the code you worked so hard on! Stay in the loop, now! One o one, yeah! It's time to develop a program. It's fun, yes, you will know. Algorithms got the rhythm. With A.I. the digits flow. Different kinds of coding language, make up lots of games you see, working as a complete package, like C# or C++. It's time to develop a program. It's fun, yes, you will know. Algorithms got the rhythm. With A.I., the digits flow. Because we are Code Masters! Because we are Code Masters! Because we are Code Masters! Because we are Code Masters! Oh, look! It's Billy! I wonder where Cowy is... Play! I think Billy is waiting for something. Oh, maybe that's it! I wonder... Of course! You're going to build a robot for the contest, Oh, this is Play! I think Billy is saying it's time to build, Don't be angry, Cowy! He just wants to build a great robot. Oh, Cowy... I don't know if that's such a good idea... Oh, boy... I didn't say anything! Sorry Billy We have to be practical, Billy. The contest is about to start. Why don't we give them a chance? Don't worry Billy! The rest of the robots aren't so good. Don't worry Billy! The rest of the robots aren't so good. Eh... Maybe I was wrong. Math test What is the mass of the Universe? Correct! Strength test What is the answer to life, the Universe and everything? Forty-two. Correct! Billy! Hello! Focus, focus! Math test You got it? Oh... How about this? You go it? Po-ta-to! Oh, boy! Poor robot! Yes, yes, yes, yes! Woohoo! Woohoo! Everybody dance! Do the robot! Everybody jump! Congratulations, everyone! Bye-bye! [music] I spy with my little eye, something beginning with the letter K. Keyboard. Koala. I spy with my little eye, something beginning with the letter K. Kiwi. Keys. [music] More songs, activities, and the full interactive adventure [laughter] That was fun!
