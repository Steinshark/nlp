That animal is still free, Got it? Yes, I got it. Yes, sir. Timur, what are you doing? Get up, Lieutenant! - Attention! Hi, honey. No, I'm fine. First Lieutenant, it's ready, sir. Yes, it's exactly I'm not hurt, I'm sorry, honey. Not sure when I'll be home. I can't talk now. - Colonel, permission to speak. The satellite phone was used again - Same phone as at the father's home. No way to tell. - To whom? Caller unknown, recipient unknown. We know the call went A residential street. The team on site - You got them? Let's see them. Why'd you keep this quiet?! You said to report I know this man. <i>1, 2, 3...</i> <i>...18, 19, 20!</i> - <i>Madina, no peeking.</i> - It's hot today. Terribly. <i>Trading two is too many.</i> <i>Hey, Shamil!</i> <i>Shamil! <i>You promised, Shamil!</i> <i>Don't kill this one!</i> <i>Who will I trade my relatives for?</i> <i>One officer will be enough.</i> <i>Take him.</i> <i>Daddy! Daddy!</i> <i>Tell her not to peek.</i> <i>I didn't peek.</i> <i>Settle down.</i> Let's not talk here. Come into my office. - You found grapes out of season? What do you want? Have a chat about your friends. Just take me to jail then. I don't have long left anyway. I'm not involved any more. Life's different now. But I won't betray my friends. Who are your friends? I'm not asking about their names. Who are they as people? They're my brothers in faith. - And why do you kill people? Maybe you haven't. Your brothers in faith, then. What do you fight for? For freedom. Don't kid yourself. You got your freedom in '96. The troops were withdrawn. Got autonomy, money to help rebuild... and what happened? Need a reminder? All stolen, in just three days. Couldn't get by, of course. So what did you do? You went begging to the Arabs. They were happy to help, Only, not into the economy, But to crime lords and local strongmen. Ask your friend, Limpy, You came here, to Dagestan. Ran away, huh? While they tortured Enough. I didn't run away. You see us all as thieves and bandits, - Let's end this conversation. But hey... think back to the trade. When they planned to trade Limpy put your family at risk. You know why? He couldn't care less about all you. He'll use anyone to achieve his ends. Including your children. Half the kids who died in Beslan What if your girls Don't tell me about your Whose side are you on, Isa? His? Really? People are tired of war. Our children should live in peace. Your daughters should live in peace. There must be no more deaths. - How are things in Georgia? - Just need to get them across the border. Can you tell me at last Ever been to Leningrad? - Or whatever they call it now? As a kid, on a school trip to... - that big museum. Now you'll get another chance to visit. There's an important event A summit. Everything is set. Our people just need the missiles. You plan to kill them all? Do I look like a madman? If we kill them all, Who will help us? No. Our target is one man... the Russian president. Shamil, yes. The summit will be the perfect event. That's right, Murad. It will be beautiful. Just as Mother Russia we'll chop off her head! Remember how the USSR fell? Now, Russia will start falling apart. The Caucasus, Tatarstan, Bashkiria, even Siberia... they'll all want to be independent. And most importantly, in all the chaos no one will care Then our time will come. &quot;Terrorists are not Muslims. The fate of these murderers he who deliberately causes death Our condolences go out and we ask the Almighty to show the victims His mercy.&quot; This is the statement But I would also like Many of you will remember how, I and others declared jihad Now we have warring gangsters. Neighbor fearing neighbor, Brother avoiding brother, You see it all yourselves. These people have no true faith. They bring hatred... and fear. I tell you, to be true Muslims. - Any news? Major, this just came info you requested on that guy, Khloyev. Right, the major. All seems in order. &quot;Conscripted into service...&quot; &quot;Unit 57-104&quot;. 57-104... That rings a bell. Son of a gun! - Zoom in here. Did you run a check? Nothing came up. May I interrupt? This Khloyev guy He even has Look where he served. - OK. Anything besides the same Army unit? Bazgayev and he were in the same unit, Bazgayev studied in Moscow. If we check everyone he may have met, Ravil, I'll bet you anything that it was him driving Bazgayev - Did you see it happen? Remember, Ganiyev said some cop - It's definitely a lead. Are you nuts? This requires planning. We have to check him out, thoroughly. We already did, Ravil. It's only Khloyev, his wife, It's a dying village. Let's go poking around - I can't today. You go ahead. But take Timur with you. Hey, Student! - I think I'll... go pay a visit. - And what should I do? You can't, without a warrant. - What were our orders? So you keep watch then. Cover me if needs be. Yes. Hello? I'll call back, I can't hear you. - Yes, hello.<i> Come by my work. I'll be waiting. Today? <i>No. Come now.</i> I might change my mind. - Well? Call me as soon as the owner comes. I've gotta go, Report anything suspect, - Wait for me. Jaywalking. Really, an old hand like you Keep your eyes open. I don't know... where Shamil is. He only calls Asks how things are going. There's some cargo in Georgia. When it's ready, I'm to drive it What cargo? He didn't say. When? I don't know. He's got friends in customs? I have to find a friend there myself. No need. We can do that. Hey, Isa! Get up. Here we go, come on. Well? I'm OK. We'll get you to OK, because my daughters... Well, you've seen them. How can I possibly deserve Maybe it's... for the good you'll do for others. <i>- Is here OK? <i>Alright.</i> <i>- Don't be long. - Yes, Timur? <i>With his wife, I think. Understood, sit tight. I'll be right there. A corrupt customs officer... That'll work. I'll tell Shamil that I've found a man. Now go. I'll call you. <i>Maybe they don't know you're here.</i> <i>So he came in the cellar to get pickles?</i> <i>Get me out <i>It's too dangerous.</i> <i>I'll go tell my wife. <i>Stop! Don't be stupid. <i>I won't leave without her. <i>I won't get busted because of a woman.</i> <i>You and I are leaving.</i> <i>Make sure there's no ambush waiting.</i> Timur! Have you fallen asleep? Timur! Cellar's clear. Hand over the weapons. Turn in your gun. General, it was my decision. You had no right to leave Timur alone. Neither as a man, nor as an officer. 25 years old, 2 children. - I went to meet Isa. - A former gangster and crime partner! So he confirmed Bazgayev doesn't tell him everything. Or Isa doesn't tell you. If Bazgayev bought the missiles things are beyond bad. Remember the papers - The sewing patterns? But they're not patterns. They're plane routes between Imagine what Limpy A whole lot worse than Beslan. Look, we have no other way And about Isa, General... People change. Isa will drive the cargo to Bazgayev. He'll bribe a Russian customs officer <i>I</i> will be that officer. Does Isa understand Sir, he wants this war over. <i>Daddy, daddy!</i> <i>Should we heat some milk?</i> <i>Why aren't you asleep? -<i> Hello, Isa.</i> <i>The truck must be in Georgia tomorrow.</i> - Where's Ravil? - You seen Ravil? General, sir, bon appetit. Thanks. So, Bazgayev called Isa. He's to transport a shipment Its contents are unknown. Isa chose an old truck, He'll drive from and meet Bazgayev's people in Tarskoye. What if the Georgians tail the truck, What if Bazgayev and Isa is working for him? I trust Isa. I suggest we wire the truck That'll only work He really wants these missiles. He took part I know he'll come to meet this, too. I hope so. I really hope so. How will you mine the truck? No, Bazgayev thinks Isa will go which gives us a few hours. Grab a bite to eat. We doing this? Hit it, come on. Ready? Sit down, it's fine. Where's Ravil? Taking a nap. Been training all day We've been... assembling, dismantling, Can you do it quickly enough? We'll have to. You realize they'll probably Bazgayev, the Georgians, whoever. Get close and it'll... Yes, I know. Called your family? Well, as they say... break a leg. Go, go, go! - Got it. - Go, go, catch it. You nervous? It's damned hot. Forty in the shade will do that. I don't have much water. And no air in the truck. - I'll get you some water. Let him through. Thank you. The &quot;oranges&quot; are through. EPISODE 4 What the hell? <i>Phone call for you.</i> Yes? What's going on? That's what I'd like to know, Egor. <i>Isa, listen to me.</i> <i>I can't talk long.</i> <i>One of our men will get in your truck. Let's go. Well, then. Isa is working with them, after all? If so, then why Why let us track him? I bet Bazgayev Dammit. He's got an escort vehicle, too. So we can't follow, We still have a drone. The drone will drown soon. The wind will soon pick up, So what now? - Cancel the operation. Dispatch military helicopters, call and tell Isa to leave the truck. - And blow it up. It's the only option. Sure is hot in here, brother. Just hold on a second. Wait. OK, there's an escort vehicle. Will it follow them all the way? Probably not. They won't risk it. They won't take that risk. They know it might expose the truck. There are police checkpoints ahead. Golden Eagle, enhance the image. Where might they stop? Anywhere. What's along there? Nothing much, all clear. Just a gas station. Just a gas station. On those mountain roads, they need... 90 minutes to reach the station. We can be there in 30. And? We can make it in time. Drive safe. Fill it up. Get me some water, would you? A couple bottles. Make it three. Isa, pay the man! Don't drink it. - How much? - Keep the change. - Want some? Or I'll be dripping with sweat. <i>Go back, we'll take it from here.</i> Is that it? That's it. We have moved into the final stage. Well, General? Godspeed. Let's get to work. Hey. How are you? You OK? He's carrying this. Attention! Repeat, the truck is armed. - Do you copy? Is everything OK? Need the all-clear Well? The threat has been neutralized. Let's get to work.
