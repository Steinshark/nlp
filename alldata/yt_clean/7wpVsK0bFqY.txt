Two stray puppies arrived at the house, but the homeowner was not home, working in another city instead, He saw the puppies at home through remote monitoring, The two puppies had already made themselves at home, joining forces against an intruding black dog, The homeowner couldn't bear to see the puppies hungry and suffering here, so he asked his friend to come and take care of the puppies, The man also loves animals, and immediately set off upon receiving the message, Stopping by a supermarket, the man bought food for the puppies, The journey was indeed quite far, This is a black dog raised by a family at the entrance of the village, The man finally arrived and saw the puppies. The puppies were quite shy, always keeping their distance from the man, This black dog was different, wagging its tail, waiting to be fed, This is where they usually sleep, They were too hungry, Stray life does not come with a full meal, so they were constantly in a state of hunger, They would definitely want water after eating, Use this abandoned pot to give them some water, The man noticed they wanted more food, so he continued to feed them, Going to fetch water for the puppies, Cleaning up for the puppies, It was getting late, and the man had to go back.

Food is here, time to eat. The water from yesterday is almost finished, First, let's give them some water, They are waiting for their meal, The man is going to make a simple stove for the puppies to cook the meat, One of the eggs broke on the way, Dogs can eat cooked food. Finally cooked, But it's too hot now, Cool it down with some cold water, The two little ones are eager to eat, Dogs can't eat bones, so the man removes the bones from the chicken legs first. Finally, it's time to eat, There are chicken legs, eggs, bread, and ham sausages inside. After finishing the meal, pour them a carton of milk, The dog house is quite clean, with no excrement. After eating and drinking their fill, they went to play in the grass. The puppies are no longer afraid of the man, They can be picked up and petted by the man. The man has to go back now, The puppies bid him a reluctant farewell this time, On the third day, the man finished work when it was already dark. But he still needed to go check on the puppies. The man casually ate at a roadside fast food restaurant, bringing some porridge for the two puppies, then went to the supermarket to buy them eggs, and hurried off towards the puppies, Finally arrived, but there was no sign of the puppies. They were actually sleeping, but now they came out to greet him. They must be starving, So let's quickly have some food, Starving, they relished the porridge with raw eggs. By the time the man fetched water, they had finished their meal, Full and happy, they started playing. The man left them food and water, and it was time for him to head back home, The two puppies are lovely and sensible, Just like the man, they are reluctant to part ways, Thus they bid farewell with mutual reluctance, On the fourth day, during lunchtime, the man made porridge for the puppies. He also went to the supermarket to buy them some pig liver, and set off to check on the puppies, Greeted joyfully, The two puppies were very affectionate towards the man, Because with him around, there would be food to eat. With pig liver, it needed to be cooked. He gathered some dry firewood to start a fire, Thunder rumbled, and the man quickened his pace. But it started raining nonetheless, Luckily, the man had brought a bag of dog food, Their nest got wet from the rain, The man rearranged a new shelter for them in a rain-free spot, After tidying up, the man had to leave, He dried off the puppies before leaving, The sky was getting dark, and the man really had to go. On the fifth day, many things the man bought had arrived. They were new toys for the puppies, And a cushion for their doghouse, This time the man brought pig liver, The two little ones wanted to eat before it was cooked, So they lay down waiting for the meal to be served, When the food was ready, they could finally eat. The puppies really liked this new cushion, On the sixth day, the man encountered a dog flattened by a car. The man immediately decided to take the puppies home to care for them, So he set off to fetch the puppies right away, The two puppies eagerly awaited to be fed, Let's eat first, The food and water in the bowl were all gone, Eat up, when they're full, they'll go home with the owner. The man packed up the puppies' things to take with him, Before leaving, let's take one last look at this home, Let's go, time to go home together. These two are really well-behaved, The man was initially worried they might run off, But now it seemed that worry was completely unnecessary, Finally, they arrived home. From then on, they officially had a home, The man was welcomed by the puppies every day after work, It also became easier to cook for the two little ones, The puppies patiently awaited the meal, The man's mood improved every day when he saw the puppies, This idyllic country life is enviable, There are vegetables grown in the garden, Have the puppies grown a lot? The man plans to build a doghouse for the puppies, He first designed it on paper, And then began construction, The doghouse is made of wood and bamboo, It seems that the puppies really like this shelter.
