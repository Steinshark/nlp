[Narrator] This is Donald Knuth. [ classical music ] [slides click] Professor. [slides click] Author. [slides click] Math savant. [slides click] [ dramatic organ music ] Pipe organist. And this is Donald Knuth's &quot;The Art of Computer clocking in at well It's considered by many to be a founding text [ rousing classical music ] Bill Gates once said, &quot;If send me a resume.&quot; [mouse clicks] [film projector rolls] [ upbeat music ] when Knuth was of writing volume one, there was no guarantee his opus would ever [film projector rolls] That's because the same that drove Knuth to analyze his and optimize his around the trash can was getting in the way of Checking and Knuth blew through His editor demanded progress, his family missed him and still, volume one Finally, he arrived If he could not make he would make it perfectible. And so on page 12 he added a [typewriter keys clack] "I will greatly appreciate about any errors so that they may be in future editions." [paper rips] It worked. [ upbeat music ] As soon as the book hit shelves, error reports started coming in. Mathematicians corrected Knit pickers pointed With each find, Knuth mails out That's 1-0-0 in hexadecimal, in case you didn't know. So far, Knuth's got more than $22,000 worth of checks. They've even become a bit More get framed than cashed. And with each new fewer and fewer errors remain. Flash forward to today, and the software for the apps and services billions of people rely on face a conundrum [traffic noises] [machines buzz] [keyboard clicks] How do you make without delaying You follow in Knuth's footsteps and start rewarding the people [ anthemic music ] When it's your job to keep you have to live and breathe and see the internet just because the only is to think like one. [ soft music ] This is Eduardo Vela, Security Engineering Lead [Eduardo] Yeah. Hello. [laughs] [Narrator] Eduardo doesn't but he has found in all kinds of software-- including Google's. [Director] Does Google [Eduardo] Sure. Google has bugs. Google has vulnerabilities. Everything that we that relates to software, we are putting some trust on whoever wrote that code. [ upbeat music ] We as Googlers, we recognize of the faith that We have a team of people that will look at the codes, that will look at the products and we look for bugs. But then inevitably, there is going to be something that we didn't know about. [Narrator] Coming up with out of Google's code One that's held Principal Engineer on Google's He knows more about bugs [Christoph] There's basically There's functional bugs where the program just like some UI element. You click on the button, nothing happens, that kind of thing. [error noise] And then there's security bugs where the program but it has a security for instance, somebody else that they're not [ soft music ] [Narrator] He's talking [Christoph] Memory buffer overflows, injection bugs, cross site script injection, SQL injection, predictable identifiers, various authorization I don't know. Let's leave it at that, [Narrator] Fair enough. But if we already know why do they keep popping up? [Christoph] One with a software over the internet is that Many web-facing get delivered a new or even every week. So the software is Every time there is a change, there is a possibility of that could potentially [Narrator] So and code is always changing. Faced with this problem, there are two approaches hope no one finds their bugs and threaten to or think like Knuth and ask the [ suspenseful music ] [Camille] So there are a for the intellectual tend to search for [Royal] When you community of hackers, one of the things loved doing was finding something that no one else [Tim] I think it an innate sense of curiosity, wanting to figure [Eduardo] Literal in Spanish is &quot;pirata informatico,&quot; which means I think it represents when we talk or vulnerability researchers. You are looking for clues, you're looking for hints and you're trying to into something that is like That's why it's and yeah, it's like hunting [laughs] for bugs. We have this program called a Google in which we ask that are able to to tell us about it. [Narrator] Across more thousands of amateur and have answered the call, filing thousands of Over time, a few of these the best of the best. [Eduardo] Bug hunters are from They come from as many Sometimes it's very and that's usually where exactly they are from. [ western music ] There is one guy named Callum. [Callum] I hack companies in It's the easiest way [Eduardo] There's [Yesenia speaks [Eduardo] We have Joao He used the money for rewards to build companies. Now he has many He has houses and [beep]. Sorry. [laughs] He has houses [Narrator] Look at the and you'll find the number one ranked [Tomasz] I'm number one and I'm not really into keeping number one. I don't know why. [laughs] [Narrator] But hot is a new generation of hackers. One that entered the hunt Meet Ezequiel Pereira, hacker since homeroom. [ mellow music , [Ezequiel] When I I decided to try to find like, vulnerabilities in the high school website. Bringing the site down or editing some &quot;Oh, there are no classes,&quot; Then I got caught. They suspended me for a month and made me clean until the end of [mop drags] [mop bucket creaks] [water splashes] And that was not fun at all. That was not fun at all. [Narrator] Youthful it didn't take long for Ezequiel to start putting his [Ezequiel] In 2018, I reported a security Suddenly, I get &quot;Congratulations. Thank you for reporting Called my mother. [phone ringing] &quot;Hello, by the way, Google told me that a vulnerability they would be rewarding Suddenly, she screamed [Ezequiel's mom screams [laughs] and I had to [ dramatic music ] [Reporter] Authorities are to file charges [Narrator] As long as there have been but there hasn't for their skills At least not ethically. Early resistance paying for bugs drove hackers to the where bug brokers that operate and their discoveries with open arms. It's a problem that [Tim] These days, you you can look what the price of and also, if you're a security researcher, you can submit what's basically known as where you would sell to a bug broker who would then to unspecified clients, usually at a and the clients we're nation states or people with [Director] Why would they be [Tim] Almost certainly to [Narrator] In the early rewards were given out from a limited prize pool. [ dramatic music ] To counter the growing and to find more of the errors Tim and Eduardo had and increase the [Tim] We thought, if we said we'd pay infinity We spoke about it. And Like, would there would not pay for No? Okay. Then aren't we basically saying there's infinity million [Narrator] Since moving bug finds have gone parabolic with new records But it's not just about Here's Katie Moussouris, She's an expert in what [Katie] Having a steady stream of high-quality that takes a whole bunch and that is I think Google They have their own very highly interacting with on the outside of [Narrator] That starts with or at least a handwritten email. [Tomasz] The engineer who he actually writes a &quot;Nice catch!&quot; &quot;Nice catch!&quot; [Joao] &quot;Nice catch!&quot; [Ezequiel] &quot;Nice catch!&quot; [Tomasz] They always [Callum] The classic the &quot;nice catch,&quot; yeah. They've got an [Yesenia speaks [Joao] And sometimes &quot;Whoa! Very nice catch! Oh my God, you are It's nice. [Tomasz] And I love it's individual thing For the bug. [Katie] And that direct engineer to is one of the most powerful way more than money. [Narrator] The respect for the hunters is about It's about gratitude [ upbeat music ] because the bugs they find They're also studied. [Katie] The best hackers who continually learn We are exchanging ideas, learning new techniques and expanding upon [Narrator] Bugs reported to strengthen the preventative allowing the code of the future to start out a little [Christoph] Sometimes from a bug hunter where somebody found a that actually betrays a of how the application works. You wonder, &quot;How do they And you're like, &quot;Oh, And then quite a few of getting hired [laughs] sort of emerge as somebody who really has a particular [Narrator] Yep. Sometimes the error-finders [Ezequiel laughs] It's a journey Knuth [ dramatic music ] Today, engraved in the are the words of &quot;The road to wisdom? Well, it's plain and simple Err and err and err again, but less and less and less.&quot; A fine message for the of software engineers and the bug hunters that will bring their code a little closer [Director] Eduardo, Thank you so much. [Director] This is wonderful. [Eduardo laughs] [Eduardo] All right. Goodbye. Have a nice day. [laughs] [light switches off] [ anthemic music ] [Tim] Zero-day is a type of that attackers know about but defenders don't. [Royal] And so we're gonna to finding the hardest-to-find and get them fixed [Parisa] At Project Zero, we rigorously, ruthlessly break the internet. [Natalie] My motto [Tim] The weakest might be a non-Google product. The implant allowed them photos, GPS locations. [Sen. Fred Thompson] Within the seven of you could for the entire nation. [Tim] If the company doesn't we put it all online.
