Go grab that table because I got We got the company card. We're gonna go on a spending spree. I'm not quite sure if this will work. It might. Well, that's an interesting way of doing that. That would be perfect if it. If I can get it down there. Have fun. I got the foam in here. Whoa. It's so massive. How's it gonna fit? He just wants it half the size. Half the size? Thought that was gonna No, no. Try it again. I don't think it will work. Ow. Frick. Again. Nope, nope. First time was dumb. The second time was stupid. Taking him down a table.

Should I Do you have anyone you could ask? I've got one person I could ask. I got the girl's number at The nurse? Yeah, the nurse. Should I give Bryton my number? Yes. That would be the Yeah. Can you call her and ask her Yeah, I'm down, like, right now. Yeah. This is going to be so awkward. Hey, Hello This is really weird. I know that this is Brighton's phone, but he is underwater right now and he be interested in going on a date tonight. With him. Underwater? Possibly. So you would have to bring a bathing suit. But are you down to uh- come You know what? Sure. Might as well. He's cute. I'm the best wingman ever! Am I eating underwater? Possibly. I'm gonna go tell Bryton. He's gonna be so stoked... I can't believe you got It's Actually Insane. I'm so scared. Like this is a bad idea. Let's do a chocolate croissant, ham and cheese croissants. Just ham and cheese, no egg. I think it's just the ham and cheese ones. It's 9:37. I've only been in here for 50 minutes. and I already need to pee. My dad hates it if we pee in the pool, Sorry, dad. We've brought the food. James has returned. Where's my breakfast? I've been waiting like, 45 minutes. Oh, my Gosh. They talked me into buying All these are going down to him? We're gonna give him three. Maybe he doesn't deserve food. Food's loaded up. I guess Bryton deserves to eat. I'm losing my mind. Yeah. At least breakfast. We're going in Here. There's not much room in here, guys. It's sounds so weird in here. I know. It's so echoey. What is this? Is this your table? I'm sorry. Yeah, this is my table. I should probably get out of here also. I'm gonna explode. Why is he going to explode? So here's a croissant. I don't think this is what I ordered. I asked for ham, egg and cheese croissant. Ha ha I think I just said ham and cheese. Ham and cheese croissant, no egg. I think it's just the ham and cheese ones, bro, Ha ha ha I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Dude, This is just ham and cheese. Ha Ha I was delusional. I was down here. I just heard cheese. It's not as good without the egg. I hate eggs. I kind of did it just for myself. Drage is being so helpful. I wouldn't be able to do it without him. You're the man, Drage. I love you. Whoa. That's crazy. He looks like an aquarium Okay. Oh, here's Brighton. He's coming. He's coming to the window. He's going to hit his head too. That would be so funny. Oh, no, he's smarter than Drage. Okay, good luck, Brighton. Just don't die. You got this. Feel my forehead. No. Feel it. I can see your big head. Yes I can. Please, just feel my bump on my head. No. Cole, can you feel it? Don't poke it... You said feel it. Ow. You freaking hurt it. Can you help me out? No. Just help me out. Just go out the side. Oh. Oh say can- you see... And the rockets red glare, Bryton has been ordering and one of his orders was to And the home of the brave ---- yeah USA America When he get's out of this box He's never gonna want I've got some visitors.This is Grace Hey Guys Hey, guys. I feel squished right now. Sorry, but I'm feel really good. Get out of here. Get out of here. I kind of wanted to watch some, shows and stuff, Do you want us to go download like, like, Yeah, that'd be fun. We can have a movie date, all three of us. Okay. What are you doing up there? I just hit the three hour mark. I'm feeling okay? I've got a little bit of a headache. I'm almost done with my movie, but I've been just trying to I feel tired, and this is not fun. MrBeast said not to do this. I would really not recommend Don't do it. It's not smart. It was one of the hardest and now I'm starting to see why. It's really boring, and I don't know how good We put in every safety I may think nothing can go wrong, Drage made a big mistake. I'm gonna die in here!! Stay tuned to see if I can safely and go on an underwater date. This isn't very fun. I'm ready for lunch. Ashton Just got here. What's up? We've got walkie talkies? Oh, you should take it down to him. You should take. You should take it down to him. He misses you. See if it works. I want food!! Oh, he wants food. What food do you want? Over? Panda Express. There's a Kayson monster. How you doing in here? Do you like my bucket? yeah Yeah, it's kind of funny down here. Oh, that's not good... It's not pumping air. This is bad. Guys, the air pump stopped working. You're not pranking me. No I was afraid that was gonna happen This is really bad. The pump stopped working. I don't know. I can't stay down here for It's so hot. It's overheating? Yeah, like, Luckily, so we gotta call him and tell I don't know what to do. No one's down here. Where's my walkie talkie? What's happening? It was in a ziplock bag. What? Take this down to him and put I don't know Kayson just brought me this air pump. I can pump air from this into here. Maybe that's what they want me to do. This isn't gonna be good enough. So we just got a call from Drage, and he told us that Bryton's I guess we're gonna have to Pick him up. This new battery only lasts an hour, A new what? We just made it to Home Depot. We're gonna go inside and Probably not gonna be able Can't stop. Addicted to the shindig. Chop top. He says I'm gonna win big. Wait, wait, wait. What? Bro Bryton could die If we don't get that air compressor He's gonna have to come up. So we got the new air supply. Let's go set it up. Perfect. Hopefully he doesn't die. You plug this in. I am huh gonna jump back in the water So I think he's got air now. This is gonna be better than, Christmas morning. Oh, yeah. Let's go take him the new air supply. Okay, it's been 45 minutes or maybe an hour of the backup And look at what I got! If I can take a full breath. I was kind of scared it was and that's when the You made it just in time. How we doing? You gotta put your bathing suit on I'll just look in the window. Bye. Are you okay? You're tired? No. Oh. Challenge over. I'm so confused. I just got sidekicked, okay? This is so weird. My life is so weird. My son lives underwater. Is it hurting the pool? I mean, but is he ruining the pool? Probably not. We got him food in the morning, How long's Brighton been down there? We're coming up on the five hour mark. 5 hours?!! Yeah. How long is he trying to go for? 24 Are you kidding? He's taking MrBeast on with the He's starting with that one. We figured if we can beat the one then we'll complete any We're not even gonna be here to see because we're getting ready He was supposed to fly out with us. And they're competing at We leave in 2 hours. So if he gets out, I guess I'm gonna go Brighton better not be peeing in my pool. I already pee. That is not allowed. That's a number one rule. I mean, safety and then that. Here we go. I'm bringing Brighton What am I doing? Whoo. There's not a lot of air in here. No, there's not. So I'm gonna head up so I There's some food... There's some water. Thanks, dad. I'm a little concerned. Are we sure he has proper oxygen? Do you have an oxygen meter? We did, but it got wet and got destroyed. When I was told about this idea, I was told they were taking And you didn't even check to see We took it down, and it said mediocre air quality, it hit the water and destroyed. Okay, Yeah. This is not a good idea, guys. He didn't eat all of his veggies. I'm gonna go check on Brighton, Hi, Bryton. I've got a visitor. How do you go pee down here? Do you just go. I've been just going all day. Just making sure it's okay. Get out of here. Get out of here. Don't pee in here. Only I'm allowed to pee down here. Have you been watching movies? What the. Yeah. And survive. I think he's going insane. Bye, Ashton. Bye! I put more batteries in this It must have dried out. Let's take you down Because I'm really concerned Bryton is breathing right now. Let's see how good the air quality is. 5000 Guys, this is not good. The CO2 monitor is maxed at 5000. That is not good. So I came up so that he can see if he can get that number down without two people breathing in there. Shane, I'm not an expert on that CO2 monitor, but I'm going to suspect that is not a safe thing to do. He's not gonna be aware that he's getting I just dropped it. I dropped it in the water. Oh, dang it. I'm gonna die in here. He blew it into the water on accident. So he broke the device again. Okay, we're probably gonna That's what I told him. The thing is, but like, I feel fine that I've So is it really that bad? I just don't feel good about this. As Brighton's father, I'm chillin So if there's any question, I'm scared I'm gonna get poisoned. I thought I was doing everything right, but it looks like the I wouldn't want to like injure That would be stupid. So this might not be worth it. MrBeast is right. I should have never done this. I'm scared. I don't want to do this anymore. This isn't a good idea. I should have never done this. I know he'll be really disappointed. So the first thing I want to do is get that we can communicate because we're taking his air. I'm kind of scared, but like, I don't feel super terrible. Have him check his blood Does he have his watch on? Does he have it? I thought he did. I thought that was the Where'd that go? Did he never have it? Have we never even checked I guess we have. This is all stuff that I I said he could do this, We don't have a monitor and we're even know he doesn't have his watch. Let's get that stuff. We got to get his watch. We got to get his walkie talkie. If he wants to come out, he can come out. I'm definitely not encouraging but I also don't want him to gave up after 6 hours. Yeah. If my blood oxygen is low, I'll come up. we're 6 hours in and apparently And Drage didn't even know He can't do these kind of challenges that's not okay. We did think through it. We talked about all of this stuff. He can't risk safety for this. I hope everything is just perfectly fine. Hopefully my apple watch I don't care about a challenge. I'm having him come up. Like He said if his oxygen he'll come up. What are they supposed to be? I don't know. We'll look it up. You didn't do any research to starting this challenge? I did research because I can tell you I know I just want to see if you know I do not know the answer to oxygen levels. And you're going into a chance where oxygen without knowing what their Yeah. Normal healthy oxygen Below 95 is typically considered outside of the normal healthy oxygen read. We need to get that watch quick. You know it's code. No, that wasn't it. Sorry. It says try again in 3 hours. Who has a passcode that you do it wrong Use mine, Bruh. There weren't very many safety and Drage didn't use them. Yeah, safety really matters. It's not doing anything. It's cuz it knows we are 6ft underwater. This challenge is so much Will I be able to survive long first legit underwater date? Stay tuned for part two
