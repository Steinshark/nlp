Bonjour! If you're visiting Paris, you might be curious about French food but wondering where to find an authentic experience without breaking the bank. That's where bouillons come in! Bouillons are classic Parisian restaurants known for serving traditional French dishes at budget-friendly prices. They were originally created in the late 19th century as places where workers could get a quick, affordable meal. Originally, they mainly served a dish of beef cooked in a bouillon, or broth -- and it's this word, bouillon, that would come to define this type of restaurants. These spots offer the quintessential French experience, with dishes like oeuf mayonnaise, boeuf bourguignon, escargots, and creme caramel -- all in a lively, friendly atmosphere. Now, while bouillons aren't what we'd call haute gastronomie -- the high-end, refined cuisine you'd expect at a Michelin-starred restaurant -- they have a charm and authenticity that's hard to resist. They're perfect for travelers wanting a taste of real French food with classic French decor, but without the fancy prices. In this video, I'll be visiting five of the most popular bouillons in Paris, and I'll be ranking them based on five key criteria: location, food quality, price, decor, and service. So, if you're ready for some authentic Parisian dining, let's dive into the world of bouillons! We will start at Bouillon Chartier, the oldest in Paris, founded in 1896, located near the Grands Boulevards and classified as a "historical monument" Bouillon Chartier is open every day of the year from 11:30AM til midnight, and offers continuous service without reservation The long dining room has a beautiful Belle Epoque architecture with a high ceiling In this room have already been served more than fifty million meals! Every day a new menu is printed. The average "main" is less than 10 euros! Every day, 6 menus are printed in English. Don't hesitate to ask for one. The wine list is relatively limited, and there is only one - bottled - beer available. Your order is written by the waiter directly on the disposable paper tablecloth For this lunch, my friend and I both started with an &quot;egg mayonnaise&quot;: only 2 euros and a mayonnaise to die for! Then she went for the oven-baked bream with green beans... ... while I tasted a pork sausage "au couteau", with excellent mashed potatoes I know the French have a reputation for drinking wine at midday, but I settled for the only beer on the menu. At the end of the meal, the bill is also written on the paper tablecloth We only paid 34 euros for good, if not excellent, very classic French dishes and two drinks: what a bargain! Overall, I like going to Chartier: good food at very reasonable prices and a wonderful atmosphere in this superb Belle Epoque room A restaurant has stood on this street in the 1st arrondissement since 1832, ... but it wasn't until 2019 that Le Pharamond transformed into Petit Bouillon Pharamond! The setting has stayed the same--absolutely stunning and officially recognized as a Historic Monument, ... with decor from the Universal Exhibition that features Art Nouveau woodwork and painted mirrors. What's changed, however, is the pricing, which has been significantly lowered to capture the accessible spirit of a bouillon. Like most bouillons, there's usually a line to get in. The main dining area here is relatively small compared to Chartier, but there's an additional room upstairs on the first floor. Let's check the menu in English! And the same goes for the beverages: not expensive at all! I had a pint of beer for just 5EUR60 As a starter I took the marnated trout with dill cream and lemon olive oil. The slices were thick, wonderfully moist, and absolutely delicious, as was the dill cream. Possibly the best starter I've ever had in a bouillon! And when it's that good, I make sure to mop up every bit! My main was a grilled chicken breast a la normande, which means with mushrooms and cream, and mashed potatoes. It was delicious as well, with a tender chicken breast and creamy, buttery mashed potatoes. For dessert, I chose the panna cotta with mango and passion fruit sauce. It was decent, but not as memorable as the other two dishes. EUR26.90 for such an enjoyable meal, including a pint of beer -- definitely a fantastic bargain! I have to say I enjoyed this meal better than the one at Chartier. And remember, service is always included in French restaurants. If you really enjoyed the service, leaving a tip of 2 to 3 euros per person is a nice gesture! So, if you're looking for a great, budget-friendly spot right next to the Marais neighborhood, now you know where to head! The Bouillon Racine was created in 1906 by the Chartier family, who already owned Bouillon Chartier. To differentiate it, the family called it Grand Bouillon Camille Chartier, as it is still written on the facade. But people rapidly got into the habit of calling it Bouillon Racine since it is located on rue Racine, in the Saint-Germain neighborhood The front of the building, as well as the Art Nouveau decoration of the room, allowed its classification as historical monument in 1995. Tonight, with my wife and friends, we will dine upstairs. I think the decor in this room is absolutely stunning. Some food for thoughts before the food for the body! Just ask for a menu in English, and here it is! You can choose between 3 menus: a 2-course lunch exclusive menu at EUR19.50, a 3-course menu at EUR35 and the kid's menu at EUR14.50 You can also choose to go "a la carte" and select your favorite dish The prices are in line with the typical Parisian restaurant average. While Bouillon Racine may carry the &quot;bouillon&quot; label, its prices don't quite reflect the usual budget-friendly nature of a bouillon. As you'll see, the food here is also more refined and elaborate than what you'd find in a traditional bouillon. The wine list is interesting here, but as I was driving, I preferred to have a beer! We all 4 decided for the same starter, from the EUR35 menu: a Creme Dubarry, cauliflower soup with truffled ham My wife's main: braised beef chuck steak with glazed carrots She loved it! My main: pork ribs glazed with honey and lemon, creamy mashed potatoes. My friend's choice: chicken breast from Normandy, black trumpet mushrooms and vegetables For dessert: Opera cake, which consists of layers of almond sponge cake soaked in coffee syrup, layered with ganache and coffee French buttercream, and covered in a chocolate glaze Then the dessert of the day: Strawberry tiramisu My choice : Ile Flottante (floating island) with roasted hazelnuts My favorite desset! In total, we payed EUR41.40 each, a really good value considering the quality of the meal and the wonderfully decorated restaurant, but clearly not a usual Bouillon price! My hosts had never been to Bouillon Racine before, but they loved it and praised me for the choice. It's definitely a lovely restaurant in the area, but calling it a bouillon feels a bit misleading. A true gem of Art Nouveau, Bouillon Julien opened its doors in 1906 and is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful restaurants in Paris. Beautiful, delicious, and affordable -- that's the restaurant's motto. I completely agree on the &quot;beautiful&quot; part, but the real question is: will the food live up to the hype, and will the prices be as reasonable as those at Bouillon Chartier? Let's find out! When it comes to prices, they're about 10 to 20% higher than at Chartier, with the eggs mayonnaise being a whopping 70% more expensive. But still, they are really Bouillon prices The same goes for the beverages. In fact, the prices here are much closer to those at Petit Bouillon Pharamond. Interestingly, the company that owns Bouillon Julien recently acquired Bouillon Pharamond. I told you: the decor is stunning! As usual when I eat alone, I had a beer. I opted for the egg mayonnaise to compare them to those at Chartier. Here's where the price difference shows. At Chartier, you get just one egg with a standard mayonnaise, while here you get one and a half eggs with a flavorful herb mayonnaise. A special mention goes to the bread -- it was excellent! As you can see, I went for the same main as at Chartier. While Chartier's mashed potatoes were a bit tastier (the best being at Pharamond), the sausage here was definitely superior! For dessert, I indulged in a delicious chestnut cream paired with a wonderfully tender meringue. EUR24.80 for a full meal and a beer, with honestly very enjoyable food -- that's excellent value for money! For once, I disagree with the rating on Tripadvisor. This Bouillon is one of Paris most famous, located on Place Pigalle, at the southern limit of Montmartre Unlike the 4 other Bouillons of this video, Bouillon Pigalle is nothing historic: it was opened in 2017. However, the address is a must to enjoy, not for its atmosphere far from being as authentic as that of its other colleagues, but because it succeds quite well at reproducing early 20th century culinary traditions. I went there very early for lunch, that's why no one is queuing there. But beware, that changes very fast, and it's better to make a reservation And if you are in the waiting line, then at least you'll have time to enjoy the menu in 8 languages: French, German, Italian... Japanese Spanish English Portuguese And Chinese While waiting for my friend, I took the opportunity to take a look inside We are certainly not in a pretty Art Nouveau setting like the four other Bouillons, but it's OK Poujauran is a famous baker in Paris renowned for providing the best restaurants Finally, my friend arrives. In summer, it's a pleasure to be seated under these arcades Let's have a look at the English menu! Egg mayonnaise, snails, onion soup,... very traditional indeed! And it's the same for the main courses, with one of my favorites: boeuf bourguignon! For almost all drinks you have the choice between 6 different capacities Boeuf bourguignon is a French beef stew braised in red wine and beef stock, typically flavored with carrots, onions, garlic, and a bouquet garni My friend Nadjirou took the breaded fish with Tartar sauce and French fries. Both meals were good. He then continued with a simple yet tasty Strawberry pie... While I took my personal favorite: the Ile flottante with pralines, a dessert consisting of meringue floating on creme anglaise or vanilla custard That was a simple meal, typically French and which didn't really cost us much, as you will see. Something different here than in the other Bouillons, is they have a click &amp; collect service ... with some of their most classical dishes So, how much did we pay? 35,20EUR for 2 mains, 2 desserts and a large bottle of water. And you can pay using Apple Pay or Google Pay On Tripadvisor, a Canadian lady summarized it very well: "Although it will never have a Michelin star, Bouillon Pigalle is a very good value for money" So, if you are staying in Montmartre, or even a bit further away, give it a go! This time, I think the rating on Google is a bit overrated. As you can see on my map, marked in blue, there are three other bouillons in Paris. However, I didn't include them in this video, as they're sister restaurants of two bouillons we've already tried. Bouillon Republique is part of the same group as Bouillon Pigalle, ... while Bouillon Chartier Montparnasse and Bouillon Chartier Gare de l'Est, as their names suggest, are sister restaurants of Bouillon Chartier So, what's the best bouillon in Paris? Let's break it down by category. For location, Bouillon Pigalle takes the top spot, with Bouillon Racine a close second. Bouillon Julien, on a less charming street, comes in last. As for decor, Bouillon Racine is my winner, with its stunning Art Nouveau style and bar. Bouillon Julien and Pharamond tie for second with beautiful interiors, while Bouillon Pigalle ranks fifth due to its rather plain decor. When it comes to food quality, Bouillon Racine and Julien lead the way, while Chartier and Pigalle, though decent, come in last. The service is consistently friendly and efficient across all bouillons (they need to be quick!), but Bouillon Pigalle left me with the least favorable impression. Lastly, in terms of price, Pigalle and Chartier lead with their budget-friendly pricing. Bouillon Racine, while decorated like a bouillon, leans more toward a traditional restaurant in terms of menu and prices. All in all, my top choice is Le Petit Bouillon Pharamond: with good food, beautiful decor, a pleasant neighborhood, and friendly service, it delivers everything you'd expect from a bouillon. My least favorite is Bouillon Pigalle, though in the end, they all rank fairly close to one another. I hope you enjoyed this video and found it helpful!
