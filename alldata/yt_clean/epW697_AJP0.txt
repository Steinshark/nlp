QUITE A BIT BROUGHT IN IN 2025, PROJECTIONS AIRB&amp;B TERM RENTAL ALSO INCREASE TO NOW. OTHER PLACES, OF COURSE, VRBO AND TRIP ADVISORS FLIP OUR MARKET IN HAWAI'I HAS LISTINGS. HGEA2015 STUDY OF LISTINGS OF ADVERTISED ON VARIOUS VRBO, FLIP KEY AND CLEAR STAY. FACTORING OUT DUPLICATES, INDIVIDUALLY ADVERTISED UNLICENSED AND REPRESENT UNITS. NOW, LET'S GET TO THE THAT'S A LOT OF INTRODUCTION. WE WANT TO START WITH YOU. YOU'VE BEEN AN ADVOCATE ON TALKING ABOUT PROTECTING WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN, HOW HAVE LOCAL FOLKS HERE IN HAWAI'I? &gt;&gt; THEY'VE ENTICED PEOPLE TO ACTIVITY. THEIR OUTREACH PLUS THE OBVIOUS LACK OF ENFORCEMENT, THIS HAS CAUSED THIS ISSUE, PROPORTION. EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD ON OAHU IS VAIL, PLACES YOU WOULDN'T VACATION RENTALS WOULD EXIST. THEY'RE NOW EVERYWHERE. MANOA, I CAN NAME THEM ALL. OF HAND. AND THEY HAVE FACILITATED KNOWINGLY, SENDING OUT POST ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR VACATION CARDS ENTICING THEM TO MAKE HOMES. HOW IS THIS IMPACTING LOCAL 5? &gt;&gt; TWO VERY IMPORTANT WAYS. ONE, I THINK IS TO UNDERSTAND VALUED AT OVER $30 BILLION. THAT'S MANY TIMES MORE THAN OPERATORS. THAT PROVIDE GOOD DECENT JOBS I THINK ONE THING THAT WE DEFINITELY A NICHE MARKET FOR CERTAIN KIND OF EXPERIENCE. STAY OUTSIDE OF WAIKIKI OR THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THAT TRADITIONAL HOTELS MARKET. ONE IS THAT VISITORS WHO STAY LOT LESS THAN THOSE WHO STAY TRADITIONAL HOTELS GENERATE STATE TO FUND OUR KIDS ONE EDUCATION FOR THE ENTIRE OVER $8,000 A YEAR IS REVENUE FROM ONE HOTEL ROOM. AND I THINK THE SECOND VERY OUR MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE DENYING THAT'S RISING COST OF RURAL AREA ON THE BIG ISLAND AND IT PAINS ME TO SEE SO MANY HAVING TO LEAVE OUR WE HAVE ONE HAWAI'I, THIS IS ABLE TO RAISE MY FAMILY IN, FOR SO MANY PEOPLE WHO CALL BUT WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO NUMBER OF VACATION RENTAL ABILITY TO PRESERVE GOOD HOUSING FOR LOCALS IN THE HOMEOWNERSHIP IS GETTING MORE AND IF OUR STATE GOVERNMENT, ARE SERIOUS ABOUT ADDRESSING THEY'VE GOT TO GET SERIOUS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. &gt;&gt;Yunji: YOU'RE COMING AT THE LEGAL WAY. WHEN YOU SEE ALL OF THESE HOW DOES THAT AFFECT YOUR MAKE YOU FEEL? &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO THINK BACK TO, OF THIS. WHEN WE STARTED THE BUSINESS BUSINESS, THERE WERE NO LAWS THERE WERE NO ORDINANCES I WAS PARTICIPANT IN WRITING WITH THE DPP BACK THEN. AND IT'S OUR MISSION WAS PLACE TO STAY. SO THE IMPACT IS I HAVE TO LIVE I'VE HAD THE, USED TO BE YOU YEAR BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. I HAVE TO BE INSPECTED BY THE I PAY TAXES, GE AND T.A.T. A LOT OF THINGS I CAN DO. I HAVE TO PAY THE HOTEL TAX BUT BECAUSE I AM ZONED, NOT ZONED I AM ZONED RESIDENTIAL. I AM GRANDFATHERED IN. BUT I THINK THE IMPORTANT NEED MORE B&amp;B'S AND MORE HOME I THINK THE CONFUSION IS IN RENTAL UNITS AND B&amp;B OR HOME I THINK PUTTING IT TOGETHER IS MAKING IT VERY CONVOLUTED. SHARING YOUR HOME, YOU HAVE TO SHARE AND CITY COUNCIL HAD CLEAR DEFINITIONS. I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYBODY IS B&amp;B COULD HAVE UP TO TWO HAD TO BE LIVING IN THE HOUSE. YOU HAD TO HAVE PARKING FOR AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD THOSE KINDS OF PEOPLE THAT CAN THE WIDOW RENTING A ROOM OR TO YOU'RE ON SUSTAINED INCOME. I JUST THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST DIFFERENT PLACE THAN A HOTEL. PEOPLE WANT TO SPEND LESS BUT I THINK THAT MUSHING IT NOT RENT MANY ROOMS AND THINGS THEY ARE RENTING WHOLE HOMES FRIENDS OF MINE HAVE TO LEAVE YEAR. THIS STARTED 20 YEARS AGO. THEY'VE GOT MOVED OUT. YOU CAN RENT IT FOR SIX WHEN WINTERTIME COMES, WHICH HAVE TO LEAVE. LITERALLY HAPPENED TO A TRYING TO LIVE ON THE NORTH GOTTEN IMPOSSIBLE. PEOPLE HAVE LEFTED ISLAND. ANOTHER FRIEND MOVED AWAY. NEVER COULD AFFORD TO BUY A FAMILY OF CHILDREN. CAN'T EVEN RENT. I HAVE A 2 BEDROOM ON MY STREET MONTH. OUTRAGEOUS. &gt;&gt;Yunji: BRING YOU INTO THIS WHEN YOU HEAR ALL OF THESE TO SOMETHING LIKE AIRB&amp;B OR WHAT CAN THEY ADD TO THE &gt;&gt; ONE THING THEY CAN ADD TO WITHIN A BED &amp; BREAKFAST OR AMOUNT THAT'S PAID IN RENTALS THEY SPEND ON THE ISLAND WHEN AMOUNT IN THE HOME. MORE IN THE COMMUNITY, AN ACTIVITIES THAT ARE THERE. THOSE JOBS MEAN AN AWFUL LOT. FOR A LOT OF THE COMMUNITIES, MILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF I THINK THE TOTAL AMOUNT ON STAYING AT VACATION RENTAL. SOMETHING LIKE $1.7 BILLION. AMOUNT IN TAXES IS SOMETHING HUGE, HUGE ECONOMIC VALUE RESIDENCES. IT'S NOT, THESE JOBS THAT ARE SENT OVERSEAS. NOT JOBS BEING PERFORMED IN IN GUATEMALA. THEY'RE PAYING TAXES AND FAMILIES. A AWFUL LOT OF LOCAL FAMILIES MORTGAGE AND RENT. TO SAY, YOU CAN'T RENT OUT EVEN IF YOU'RE A WIDOW OR HAVE BEDROOMS, CAN'T RENT OUT YOU CAN'T SAY TO OLD LADY YOU CAN CAN'T RENT THEM OUT. YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO LOS &gt;&gt; AS USUAL WE'RE TALKING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHOLE 80 OF THESE -- WHOLE HOUSE RENTALS. &gt;&gt; I'M TALKING ABOUT WHOLE &gt;&gt; WHEN SOMEBODY IS LIVING IN &gt;&gt; YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TUTU ABOUT THAT. &gt;&gt; NOBODY IS COMPLAINING IT'S AGAINST THE LAW IN THE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. &gt;&gt; NOT ON THE RADAR. &gt;&gt; HIS POINT ABOUT ALL THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO THEY DETERMINED THAT EVEN TAXES, THE NET BENEFIT TO THE THE HOUSING ISSUES, BECAUSE PEOPLE WEREN'T STAYING IN PRICES AND IS SO FORTH. THEY DID A REAL STUDY THAT BECAUSE OF VACATION RENTALS. NOT GAINED MONEY. ON THE OTHER SIDE, ARE WE DIFFERENT KIND OF VISITOR, STAY AT TURTLE BAY. &gt;&gt; THEY ALWAYS HAVE. I THINK ONE VERY IMPORTANT TOURISM INDUSTRY IS THAT IT'S THE STATE OF HAWAI'I HAS OTHER, THAT WE DO NEED MARKET THAT'S CORRECT. STATE OF HAWAII HAS &gt;&gt; BUT ONE, I THINK ISSUE WITH KIND OF JOBS THAT ARE PRODUCED INDUSTRY COMPARED TO JOBS INDUSTRY, IT'S LIKE NIGHT AND &gt;&gt; IS IT? &gt;&gt; HOTEL WORKERS IN WAIKIKI HAVE RETIREMENT. $25 AN HOUR. MINIMUM WAGE. &gt;&gt; PARDON ME? &gt;&gt; THE OTHER -- ANYWAY. &gt;&gt; 17 OR $18 LIVING WAGE. &gt;&gt; $40 AN HOUR. &gt;&gt; AVERAGE COST FOR TWO SOMEBODY TO RENT IS BETWEEN YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY YOU &gt;&gt; 43 BUCKS AN HOUR. &gt;&gt; $34 AN HOUR. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. OBJECTLY A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE. AIRB&amp;B DID ADVERTISE. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT AIRB&amp;B FOLLOW IT WITH A TV COMMERCIAL OPINION. THIS HOUSE IS A HUMBLE DREAM DREAM HOME. &gt;&gt; LIVING IN HAWAI'I SAY AIRB&amp;B REALLY HELPS. &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL. FROM VERY FIRST DAY, WE HAD &gt;&gt; EXTRA INCOME HAS BEEN US FINANCIALLY WITH MORTGAGE. &gt;&gt; RATHER THAN HAVE TO RUSH WERE ABLE TO TAKE OFF A LITTLE EXTRA INCOME FROM AIRB&amp;B. AIRB&amp;B GIVES US THE OUR SON. &gt;&gt; WE APPRECIATE THESE BUT AIRB&amp;B'S REAL STORY IS A ILLEGAL HOTEL OPERATORS THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL VACATION SENDING PROFITS TO THE WITH FEWER HOMES FOR LOCAL OPPOSE AIRB&amp;B LISTING ILLEGAL NOW, AIRB&amp;B WANTS A SPECIAL PRACTICES. LOOPHOLES, ILLEGAL RENTALS. LEARN THE FACTS AT &gt;&gt;Yunji: THERE YOU HAVE IT. TWO VERY DIFFERENT OPINIONS ALSO, THE CALLS ARE STARTING YOU CALLING IN TONIGHT. SEAN FROM KANEOHE SAYS THAT HE BIG BUSINESS WITH HOTELS IS B&amp;B IS ILLEGAL. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE COMPARING APPLES OUR HOTEL OPERATORS THAT HAVE THIS COMMUNITY THAT FOLLOW OF TAXES, ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REQUIREMENTS. YOU KNOW, ONE ISSUE THAT CAME AIRB&amp;B AND THEIR ATTEMPT AT RENTAL UNITS IS SAFETY ISSUE. ALL OF OUR TRADITIONAL HOTELS AND HOW MANY TSUNAMI WARNINGS THEY HAVE VERY ELABORATE HOW DOES THE CITY &amp; COUNTY OF ACCOUNT FOR THE THOUSANDS OF NEIGHBORHOOD? WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A NATURAL AND WE'VE GOT TO EVACUATE LOW ALONG THE NORTH SHORE OF OAHU THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES TOWARDS LEGALIZING VACATION MONEY. ISN'T A QUESTION OF WHAT WE THIS IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER TO HAVE A SUSTAINABLE PROVIDES GOOD JOBS FOR LOCAL ARE GETTING PAID UNDER THE &gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE TO THROW IN ON WHEN YOU SAY THAT IT PROVIDES FICA BEING PAID. NO SOCIAL SECURITY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT TRUE. THEY DON'T PAY, HAVE ANY &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT TRUE. &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T. &gt;&gt; I KNOW A BIT ABOUT IT. THEY DON'T PAY TAXES EITHER. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT EQUIVALENT &gt;&gt; I WANT TO RESPOND TO CADE. VACATION RENTALS, B&amp;B'S ON FOR 50 YEARS, 60 YEARS. I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME AND THEY PLACE IN THE EVENT OF TSUNAMI. DON'T HAVE EMERGENCY PLANS IN OPERATING WITH ZERO STANDARDATION AND ZERO LONGEST TIME. THAT REGULATION, IDEA OF OF STANDARDIZING SOME LAW SOME LEADERSHIP, SOME THEY NEED DO IN THE EVENT OF AROUND WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE INFORMATION WITH KEEP &gt;&gt; I COME IN AND SAY, ONCE &amp; BREAKFAST, HOME STAY, THEIR STAY VERSUS A VACATION THEY KEEP PUTTING IT YOU SEE, EVEN THE AD THEY SAY AIRB&amp;B IS CALLING, BUT THEY HAVE TO SEPARATE IT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT THE SAME THAT IS ALSO WHERE IT COMES IN AND YOU WANT TO RENT A ROOM YOU WILL BE TELL THEM TO BE THERE. YOU WILL TELL THEM TO PARK THERE'S SUCH A DISTINCT YOU MUST NOT TALK THEM IN THE &gt;&gt; LOCAL 5 DOESN'T AGREE TO &gt;&gt; YES, THEY DO. PROPERTIES THAT WE'RE TALKING CORRECT. THAT'S WHAT AIRB&amp;B HAS. THIS IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT THESE ARE INVESTORS, 70% OF THEY ARE NOT ON THE ISLAND LOCAL FAMILIES THAT OWN KAILUA. &gt;&gt; VERY FEW. RENTING THEIR PROPERTIES. &gt;&gt; 30% I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU. NOT THE MAJORITY. &gt;&gt; HAWAI'I TOURISM AUTHORITY, PROPERTIES ARE OFFERED BY OUT &gt;&gt; YES. WHICH MEANS NOT A ROOM. THIS IS NOT A ROOM IN &gt;&gt; NO. THAT'S DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO DIVIDE THIS THING, THE REAL OFFENSIVE RENTALS AND THE LACK OF THE DAMAGES IT'S DOING TO OUR &gt;&gt;Yunji: ON THAT POINT, ON THEY BELIEVE THAT HAWAIIAN WAIKIKI BY THE INFLUX OF HE SAYS HE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE TOURISTS EVERYWHERE. WHAT ABOUT THAT? THAT IDEA? &gt;&gt; THAT'S AT HTA PROBLEM. A WHOLE OTHER SHOW. YOU KNOW, THEIR JOB IS TO JUST AND MORE TOURISTS IN. WE'RE AT 9 MILLION NOW. THERE IS NO TOP NUMBER. THERE IS NO CEILING ANY OF INFRASTRUCTURE FOR WHAT WE WE DON'T HAVE THE ROADS. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TRAFFIC SHORE. EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK. ONE THING I WANT TO SHARE QUITE DISTURBING, IS THAT ON THE GALL TO LIST A TEST RENTAL &gt;&gt; SERIOUS TOOL SHED ON MAUI. &gt;&gt; WITH A COT AND GARDEN HOSE &gt;&gt; I THINK THIS WILL HAVE, TO WHO SENT IN THAT QUESTION, I IMPACT THAT TOURISTS WILL ISLAND WILL HAVE OR ISLANDS VACATION RENTALS, IS THERE IS NO WAY, IT WAS CRAZY. RENTING A TENT IN MAKUA PUBLIC BEACH. &gt;&gt; WE ALTHOUGH THAT TOURISM IS BUT THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS I READ AN HCA STUDY OR REPORT THAT 9 MILLION TOURISTS A VERSUS THE 6 MILLION WE WERE WE'RE COLLECTING LESS NOW OR WERE FOR 6, 30 YEARS AGO. &gt;&gt; THAT TO THE VACATION RENTAL &gt;&gt; PARTLY BECAUSE THEY SPEND &gt;&gt;Yunji: I SEE HEAD SHAKING &gt;&gt; IMPACTING ENTIRE ECONOMY &gt;&gt; HOW MUCH MONEY WAS LEFT IN TOURIST INDUSTRY? &gt;&gt; YOU'RE SAYING THAT BECAUSE LESS NOW THAN THERE WAS 20 &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt;Yunji: WE HAVE HUG WRITING I ASSURE YOU THAT ONE OUR HOME WE ARE RENTING THE ENTIRE WERE NOT PLEASED WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD. PRESENT LAW SHOULD BE WHAT ABOUT ENFORCEMENT? &gt;&gt; THE VERY DIFFICULT. THE CORPORATION COUNSEL SET DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING &amp; DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO FOLLOW. THEY ONLY HAVE 13 TO 15 PEOPLE ZONING VIOLATIONS. IT'S DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE. IF YOU'RE A MANAGER WHAT, DO YOU PUT YOUR PEOPLE ON SOME RESULTS. SO TWO YEARS AGO, THEY PUT IN HIRED A BUNCH OF RETIRED VACATION RENTALS AND THEY AS SOON AS THE CITY SAW HOW THEM OFF. PUT $225,000 BACK INTO THE $25,000. &gt;&gt; RAISED $114,000 TO THE DEPARTMENT. THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO ONLY RELEASED $100,000. &gt;&gt; GOT A LOT DONE FOR A LOT &gt;&gt; SAID $75,000. PROBLEM HERE IS POLITICAL CITY DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. BECAUSE THEY'RE CONVINCED IT'S TOO MUCH TROUBLE. SOME OF OUR COUNCILMEMBERS ILLEGAL RENTALS. PUT THAT TOGETHER THE WEIGHT THE PUSH FROM THE MAYOR. &gt;&gt; THERE IS NO POLITICAL WILL. INSPECTOR COMES OUT, THEY ARE THRESHOLD. THEY CAN COME TO THE DOOR AND ARE YOU DOING VACATION THEY SAY NO AND THEY HAVE TO WE'RE WASTING MONEY HAVING RIDICULOUS. WHEN IT COMES TO PROSECUTING HOLDING EVIDENCE UP TO CIVIL THEY SAY YOU CAN'T PROSECUTE YOU HAVE TO HAVE PROOF. THEY WANT LIKE, YOU KNOW, RENTALS. THESE PEOPLE LEFT THE ISLAND. THEY'RE NOT COMING BACK. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE INFORMATION FROM &gt;&gt; THEY CAN'T EVEN ASK THE &gt;&gt; DO YOU AGREE THERE DOES &gt;&gt; THE LAW IS BROKEN. FLAWED. CAN'T BE ENFORCED. FOR EXAMPLE BIG FLAW IS THE IT SAYS FOR COMPENSATION. TALKS ABOUT ALL THE THINGS STAYING. IT SAYS FOR COMPENSATION. CITY &amp; COUNTY OF HONOLULU HAS THIS TAX DOCUMENTS WE'LL SHOW THE JUDGE PULLS THEM ASIDE AND THEIR TAX DOCUMENTS. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE FOR YOU'LL HAVE TO SETTLE AGAINST COURT. COMPENSATION ISSUE IS TRY TO DO CHANGE THAT WHEN CRACK DOWN. DAVID TANOUYE SAID THAT, THE LAW IS BROKEN. NEED TO GET RID OF THE WENT WITH THE BILL TO AMEND AT THE PACIFIC AUDITORIUM IN A THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT SHOWED 800 OF THEM YOU'VE GOT TO LET FOR VACATION RENTALS, BED &amp; 200 PEOPLE WERE THERE SAYING, IT'S RUINING OUR TERRIBLE. JOBS CREATING JUST TERRIBLE. &gt;&gt;Yunji: DO YOU THINK THERE TO ALLEVIATE? &gt;&gt; NO. HERE'S WHY. OWNER OCCUPANTS? ENFORCE THE LAW? &gt;&gt; I'LL ADDRESS THAT LATER. UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT WE CAN SAY YOU PASS A NEW PERMITTING PERMITS AND THE PEOPLE DON'T CONTINUE OPERATING ILLEGALLY THERE WON'T BE ANY UNTIL WE CAN AUTOMAT AND TO READ OFFER INSTEAD OF CAN BE USED, BUT SEE, ALL OF BEFORE AND THEY ALWAYS REFUSE &gt;&gt; REFUSE TO CHANGE THE LAW. MAYOR WON'T SUPPORT IT. THE POLITICAL WILL POWER IS &gt;&gt;Yunji: YOU DON'T HAVE TO OUT DOING THINGS. SAN FRANCISCO, NEW YORK, DOING IT. JUST NEED ONE PERCENT SURFING HAVE THE ADDRESS ON IT. DESCRIPTION OF THE PLACE. DOESN'T TAKE THAT MUCH. CITY HAS NO WAY TO COLLECT. ADMINISTRATIVE FINES WAS ZERO NO CONSEQUENCES FOR DOING NOTHING TO PASS UNTIL THERE IS AND WE'VE GOT TO FIND THE OTHERWISE, IT'S TOO MUCH. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE UNITED WHAT'S CALLED PROHIBITION. AND IT CREATED A HUGE MARKET, PEOPLE REFUSED IT STOP TO SAY, OKAY, WE'LL DO AWAY CAN'T ENFORCE IT. DEALING WITH THE SAME THING &gt;&gt;Yunji: ARE YOU SAYING WE EVERYONE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO &gt;&gt; UNITED STATES CONFERENCE ALLOW PERMITTING. WITH PERMITTING HAVE A THE GUY YOU HAVE THE ADDRESS TOO CLOSE CAN'T HAVE A VACATION RENTAL. OPEN ONE, WE HAVE A DOCUMENT APPLIED FOR A PERMIT. RUNNING A VACATION RENTAL &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING A LOT, PARTICULARLY FOR THE WHERE OUR MEMBERSHIP IS SEEN A CHANGE FROM, IN A GOOD OF THE CURRENT CITY COUNCIL. AT LEAST CHANGE IN THE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING AND AS WELL AS CHAIR OF CITY WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN PROVIDE THE CITY TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE ONE OF THOSE IDEAS IS TO ENFORCEMENT. YOU KNOW, ONE THE PROBLEMS THIS AND WILL READILY ADMIT INVESTIGATED OVER 3,000 OVER 3,000 COMPLAINTS. LESS THAN 100 OF THEM RESULTED AND LESS THAN HALF OF THEM SO YOU KNOW, DPP IS IN WHICH IT CAN ADDRESS THIS THAT'S TRUE. I THINK CHAIR, THE CHAIR OF COUNCILMEMBER MENOR HAS THAT WOULD BRING ABOUT PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT AS A WAY &gt;&gt;Yunji: WE WANT TO BRING THE EDDIE WRITES IN, I FEEL COMPLETE HOUSE RENTED FROM AN IS NOT IN THE ISLAND, GUEST IF NO MANAGER IS ON PROPERTY RENTERS BECOMES EVERY IF WE HAD AN ISSUE WHERE SOMEBODY SAYS, IT'S AFTER PROPERTY AT YOUR PLACE, I'M NO BEER FOR YOU TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; SOME OF OUR NEIGHBORS ARE YOU HAVE MY PHONE NUMBER AT CALL ME IF THERE'S A PROBLEM. CALL THE POLICE IF YOU DON'T I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT AT THEY HAVE TO LIVE WITHIN THE AND I'M NOT OUT THERE I HAVE NEIGHBORS. &gt;&gt; WHOLE STATE IS ESSENTIALLY THAT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I'M A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED IDEA THAT THE PERSON ON THE PROPERTY IS CORRECT. THE FACT THAT MY STATE OF HAWAII SAYS OWNER TO RENT OUT THEIR OWN I'M NOT SURE IF LOCAL 5 DOES &gt;&gt; WITH WHAT? &gt;&gt; LOCAL OWNER OCCUPANTS NOT AT ALL. WHEN HAVE WE SAID THAT? I SAID OVER AND OVER, WE NICHE MARKET. SECONDLY, THOSE WHO NEED TO BE BE ABLE TO SUPPORT AND PAY FOR TAXES AND WATER AND SEWAGE. WHY SHOULD WE PENALIZE THOSE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ENTIRE &gt;&gt; NOT TALKING ABOUT SHORT &gt;&gt; 30% OF THOSE HOMES ARE RESIDENTS. WE TALK ABOUT POLITICAL WILL. ONE THING WE HAVE GOING FOR US AIRB&amp;B IS ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS, $30 BILLION. OVER $30 BILLION. THEY'VE GONE AROUND FROM CITY ATTEMPT TO PASS LEGISLATION MORE VACATION RENTALS. HAWAI'I IS THE ONLY STATE THAT MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR I THINK THE REASON, AIRB&amp;B MILLION DOLLARS IN THE LAST 3 YEAR ON AN ACT WE JUST SAW. ONE THING THAT DISTINGUISHES COUNTY, OUR ISLAND HOME IS OUR THE AMOUNT THAT WE HAVE IS WE HAVE SEEN MORE LOCAL PEOPLE COMMUNITIES. 2010, HAWAI'I HAD FOURTH 2010. COST OF LIVING HAS THE ONE THAT HAS ENABLED OUR THIS MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR NOT JUST A QUESTION OF QUESTION IF WE'RE GOING TO PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER THING ALONG THAT EXPERIENCE FIGHTING THIS I WAS INVOLVED BACK IN 1989. PERIPHERAL LEVEL. BUT SINCE THEN, I'VE BEEN VERY WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ESPECIALLY IN THE OLD DAYS. IT WAS NORTH SHORE MOSTLY. AND KAILUA. AND WAIMANALO. SO WE ALREADY HAD A GROUP OF THIS PROBLEM. WHEN IT HIT HERE, WE WERE WE HAD ALREADY BEEN FIGHTING 2006 AND 2009 AND 10. SO WHEN IT HIT HERE, LIKE IN JUST SUDDENLY IT HIT THEM. SO THEY RESPONDED AND THEY DID EVERY CITY HAS DONE THE WRONG THEY'VE GOTTEN IN BED WITH THEY REGRETTED IT. OUT OF THESE DEALS. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SAY AWFUL LOT OF -- VOICE. &gt;&gt; CITY OF ANAHEIM IS &gt;&gt; LET'S GO TO TAPE. NORTH SHORE OF OAHU IS POPULAR SHORT-TERM RENTALS. WE DID SPEAK WITH A RESIDENT COMMUNITY. LET'S TAKE A LISTEN. &gt;&gt; PROBABLY GROWN BY AT THE MARKET. SEE PEOPLE DOING WHOLE HOME WOULD HAVE HAD BEFORE OUT IN, AIRB&amp;B IS COMING IN AND IS TO HELP PEOPLE WITH AND TRUE IN SOME CASES. FOLKS BEEN WORKING ON RESEARCH, I REMEMBER THIS LAST YEAR, WHEN FIGHTING OAHU ARE WHOLE HOMES. THIS HAS BEEN AUNTY OR UNCLE EXTRA DOLLARS. SOMEBODY IS BUYING A PROPERTY RENTING IT OUT. THAT'S OUR CONCERN. AIRB&amp;B IS NOT CORRECTLY ON. IMPRESSION. STAY IN THE BACK ROOM, A LOT I LIVE IN A NICE MIDDLE CLASS SHORE. WE'RE NOT RIGHT ON THE OCEAN. SHORT WALK TO THE BEACH. BUT IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD, OLD FANCY HOMES THAT YOU WOULD RENTING OUT WHOLE HOMES IN THE &gt;&gt;Yunji: PIGGYBACKING WHAT SO MANY CALLS COMING IN TRY TO GET TO AS MANY AS IF SHE WANTED TO LIVE WHERE LIVED IN RESORT AIR OWNED IN HER RESIDENTIAL AREA DOES IN HER NEIGHBORHOOD. TAKING AWAY FROM THE SHORT-TERM RENTERS. NO LONGER KNOWS WHO BELONGS IN WHAT ABOUT THE SAFETY ISSUE? &gt;&gt; SAFETY ISSUE, ANY INCARCERATED IN ANY PRISON, THAT WAS EVER ARRESTED OR IN SOME VACATION RENTAL IN THING IN THE PAPER LAST WEEK ABOUT THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY YOU READ ABOUT THAT? NO, YOU DIDN'T BECAUSE WE NEVER SEE ANYTHING ABOUT VACATION RENTALS HAVE WILD HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARRESTED. 30 PEOPLE ARRESTED. TEN PEOPLE HIT BY CAR. WE NEVER READ ABOUT ANY &gt;&gt;Yunji: WHAT ABOUT THE WHAT ABOUT KNOWING YOUR &gt;&gt; I THINK URSELLA IS THE IDEA THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT TRUE. &gt;&gt; NEIGHBORHOODS ON THE NORTH AREAS ESPECIALLY ON THE NORTH THAT'S WHERE GROUND ZERO WAS THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE NICE LITTLE EXCLUSIVE HOMES THAT ARE THERE, 24 OF GATED COMMUNITY. NICE COMMUNITY. AND SO NO. WHAT IT IS THE THE NUMBERS. IT'S THE NUMBERS IN A HAVE &gt;&gt; NOT ONLY THAT INDIVIDUAL GETTING INVOLVED WITH THIS HAVING A PUBLIC FACE. HAD A WEBSITE AND RAN ADS IN I'VE GOTTEN CALLS, PROBABLY SOMETIMES MORE, FROM SOMEBODY KALIHI VALLEY. WHEREVER. LIFE IT TERM. I CALLED DEPARTMENT OF CALLED SOMEBODY OUT. HAVING PARTIES OVER THERE. I THIS HOUSE IS 15 FEET FROM MY WHAT DO I DO? I HEAR THE STORIES. I GIVE THEM THE DPP PHONE DON'T GET ANY ENFORCEMENT. &gt;&gt;Yunji: ON THE OR SIDE MARKET NOT ONLY STABILIZES OFFERS VACATION RENTAL FOR ENCOURAGES TOURISM AND BRINGS ECONOMY. ONCE AGAIN, IN HOME STAY. &gt;&gt; LOOK, I MEAN, I THINK TOURISTS. WHAT ABOUT LOCAL PEOPLE LIKE AND I GET THAT PEOPLE WANT TO TO, AGAIN, HELP SUPPLEMENT BUT HOW DO, PEOPLE ARE GOING I'M BARELY A MILLENIAL. BARELY. IT'S REAL. I DON'T OWN A HOME. I'M A RENTER. IF I WANT TO BE -- I CAN'T EVEN INCOME TO BE ABLE TO PAY A AFFORD A MORTGAGE. SO WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE MY AGE THAT THAT WANT TO STAY IN HAWAI'I, THAT WANT TO RAISE OUR KIDS SUPPLEMENT ANY INCOME AND WE CAN'T EVEN BARELY AFFORD WE'VE GOT TO EARN OVER $34 AN APARTMENT? HOW DO WE AFFORD $880,000 &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHO ARE WE PRIORITIZING &gt;&gt; NOT ONLY THAT, AFFECTED HAVE THIS PHENOMENON. ON MY STREET, EVERYWHERE, PARENTS' HOME. ACLPH. IT'S EVERYWHERE. EVERY HOUSE ON I CHILDREN HAS AN ADULT CHILD LIVING PARENTS THEY USED TO MOVE OUT. &gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU AFFORD TO MOVE YOU CAN'T RENT A PLACE OR A RATHER THE RENT THE ROOM OUT MONEY. LOCAL COUPLE WRITING IN. BORN AND RAISED IN KAILUA. HAVE A SMALL VACATION RENTAL THEY SAY THEY HAVE TO HAVE TO WHAT IS IT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING MORTGAGE, THEY HAVE TO HAVE &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT TALKING WAY TO PENALIZE THOSE QUESTION IS ARE WE GOING TO NEIGHBORHOOD AND KEEP THEM ALLOW THEM TO BECOME ARE WE GOING TO ALLOW HOTELS RESIDENTIAL AREAS? &gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT TO OPERATE A RESORT AREA. &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD AND DO SO. &gt;&gt; IT'S THING IS, I HAD THIS NICE COUPLE CAME ,THEY LONGTERM, THIS HAPPENED SAME PEOPLE I KNOW. AND THEY WERE GOING TO RENT THEY SAID GREAT, GOING TO RENT THEY WERE NEVER GOING TO LIVE THEY MADE IT SHORT TERM. AND GUESS WHAT IS THIS THEY THE OWNER WILL GET IN TROUBLE NOBODY GETS IN TROUBLE. SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST IT'S JUST A WAY TO MAKE MONEY. THEY WEREN'T EVER GOING TO &gt;&gt; THERE'S A HOUSE IN THAT THEY ARE RUN UP OVER $600,000 NO REGRETS. SETTLED FOR $1,000. REPORTED TO BE DOING IT AGAIN. WENT TO. COURT. GOT A SETTLEMENT. $1,000. NOW REPORTED, NEIGHBORS ARE THEY'RE RENTING OUT SHORT SO THIS LACK OF ENFORCEMENT. OVERSHADOWS EVERYTHING WE'RE &gt;&gt; CORRECT. EVERYTHING. SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE ABOUT THIS KIND OF ONE REASON WE NEVER SEPARATED VACATION RENTAL IS BECAUSE COUNCIL, THEY COME TOGETHER. THEY WEAR THE SAME HATS. THEY WEAR THE SAME THEY PRESENT SAME STORY. IF YOU PERMIT TUTU AND GIVE ENFORCEMENT, EVERY VACATION BECOME TUTU. AND GET A PERMIT. AND GO ON OPERATING JUST LIKE BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY DOING &gt;&gt;Yunji: WHAT IS THE SOLUTION &gt;&gt; THE CITY TO GET ITS ACT LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS IT HAS TO BE AUTOMATED. DONE THROUGH ADVERTISING OR RECEIVING MONEY. THEY DID IT ON MAUI. STING OPERATIONS ON MAUI. THEY JUST WENT UP AND MADE ENFORCEMENT. THEY WON'T DO THAT IN HONOLULU THAT HERE. &gt;&gt; LAWS ARE CLEAR. ALREADY ORDINANCES THAT AS I SAID. THERE'S NO QUESTION THEY ANYTHING. THEY'RE THERE. WITH THE DPP'S HANDS ARE TIED AFRAID TO SAY, IS AFRAID TO DPP IS FRUSTRATED. THEY HAVE NO TOOLS. &gt;&gt;Yunji: YOU THINK THAT THE ANY OF THIS? &gt;&gt; YES AND NO. STATE CARES ABOUT THE TAXES. THEY SAID, IT'S NOT OUR DEAL WITH IT. WE JUST WANT THE TAX DOLLARS. THEY DON'T WORK TOGETHER. OUR CITY NEEDS TO WORK FOR OUR AND THEY ARE JUST IGNORING, I MEAN, I THINK, THE YOU THINK? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? HE SAID, IT'S COMPLICATED. &gt;&gt; IT'S COMPLICATED BUT IT'S WE ARE, IF WE'RE GOING TO A WAY TO CONTINUE TO CALL GET SERIOUS ABOUT HOUSING. WE REALLY DO. OUR GOVERNOR HAS MADE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT'S GREAT. SO HAS THE MAYOR OF OUR CITY IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF ABOUT, IT'S VERY MINIMAL. IT'S BARELY GOING TO MAKE A IF YOU LOOK AT THE GROWTH, IF HOUSING, YOU'VE GO TO GET GROWING RATE OF ILLEGAL WE TOOK HTA'S PROJECTION IN CURRENTLY INDIVIDUAL UNITS RENTALS. AND WE PROJECTED THAT OUT. IT'S NEARLY 400 HOMES, NEARLY CONVERTED INTO VACATION 400 HOMES A MONTH. IN THE YEAR-AND-A-HALF, IT'S IN THE STATE OF HAWAI'I THAT VACATION RENTALS. THE STATE, SAID. DBEDT CAME UP WITH A STUDY, BE IN NEED OF 65,000 HOW ARE WE EVER GOING TO GET ARE BEING TAKEN OUT OF OUR &gt;&gt; HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET MILLION DOLLARS CONDOMINIUMS &gt;&gt;Yunji: THAT'S A TOPIC FOR GOING BACK TO THE NUMBERS, ARE CONVERSIONS? &gt;&gt; YES. STATE. THAT'S THE STATEWIDE. THE STATE'S NUMBER IN TERMS OF STATE NUMBER AS WELL. THIS IS NOT JUST ISLAND BY THIS IS A STATEWIDE ISSUE. IF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE HAVE A GOOD TOURIST BRIGHTEST YOUNG PEOPLE HERE ROBUST ECONOMY, YES, THAT'S BUT WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO GET GOING TO HOUSE OUR LOCAL I MEAN, IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE IF WE'RE GOING TO BE SERIOUS NEED THE POLITICAL WILL. WE'VE GOT TO, OF COURSE, OF POLICY. I WOULD SAY AGAIN, LEADERSHIP IS TAKING SOME STEPS TO MOVE THEY'VE NOT TO MOVE QUICKER THAT DIRECTION. COUNTY OF MAUI IS MOVING IN COUNTY OF MAUI, YOU KNOW, IS TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE ILLEGAL LINE AND IN AN ATTEMPT TO TRY &gt;&gt; YOU JUST NEED ONE PERSON, LISTED. WE'RE TALKING AIRB&amp;B, AIRB&amp;B. THAT'S THE NOISIEST ONE AT THE BUT THERE ARE DOZENS OF BOOK CONSEQUENTLY, THE NUMBERS ARE THIS IS JUST AIRB&amp;B NUMBERS. AND SO IF YOU ADD IN ALL THE THOUSANDS MORE. IT'S NOT JUST AIRB&amp;B ISSUE. IT'S ALL THE BOOKING NUMBERS HAVE TO AFFECT &gt;&gt; THAT IS TRUE. DEFINITELY TRUE. BUT AIRB&amp;B IS ALSO THE LARGEST PLAYER. &gt;&gt; AIRB&amp;B DID NOT, WORLDWIDE, LAUNCHED ON ALL THE TALK ABOUT A SOPHISTICATED ONCE. THEY ARE A SOPHISTICATED &gt;&gt;Yunji: LET'S BRING IN SOME HALEIWA WRITING IN, PEOPLE THE NEXTDOOR HOUSE IS RENTED THE HOUSE VALUE DECREASES ARE THERE ANY COMPENSATED FOR HOUSE? &gt;&gt; YES. UNDER STATE LAW, THERE ARE STATE LAW TO SUE FOR ZONING AND CASE TOOK PLACE ON THE AGO, WITH SEMI SUCCESSFUL IN APPEALS COURT AND SO FORTH. SO THAT IS AVAILABLE TO IT'S EXPENSIVE AND PEOPLE BUT THE BILL, MR. WATANABE THE COUNCIL NOW, WOULD ADD TO OR IMPROVING PRIVATE RIGHT OF GOING BACK TO ENFORCEMENT PROBLEM WE HAVE WITH THE PERMITTING, USED TO BE THE DID BUILDING DEPARTMENT. THEY USED TO DO THEIR NOW, THE ALL ONE DEPARTMENT PLANNER IN CHARGE OF THAT IS NOT THEIR MANTRA. THEY'RE NICE PEOPLE. GREAT DESIGNERS. BUT THEY'RE NOT POLICEMEN. SO LAST YEAR, 2016, WHAT KIND CHARTER COMMISSION. PUT FORTH CHANGE THE TITLE IN ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. JUST CREATE A POSITION. WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY WOULDN'T COST A PENNY. DPP SAID NO.
