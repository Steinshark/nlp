We were given the task: we need to go, shoot, and get out. We're already prepared. We have a plan worked out on how each person should act, starting with the commander, ending with the gunner, and so on. Our job is simple: we go out, shoot, and leave. Everything's fine. Not seeing the enemy doesn't mean you can't hit them, can't destroy them. Caption: Artillery. Grad. Generally, the use of artillery as such... It's used for assaults when our infantry is advancing, for repelling enemy assaults, for covering our troops' withdrawal... Caption: BM-21 &quot;Grad&quot; Commander, callsign &quot;Pyatochkin&quot; All infantry actions are coordinated with artillery actions. Overall, any action -- and the infantry knows there's fire cover. My driver is a racer. He loves to speed in the IFV. I tried to stay as focused as possible because you have to drive there very carefully, so as not to damage the combat vehicle and reach the destination. I wanted to justify the trust of our command and wanted to perform in such a way that everything turned out very successfully. Should we drive here? Where? There's a swamp there. Well, it's a swamp, but better not to drive into it. Let's avoid it... There will be a &quot;Pyatochkin&quot; standing there... He will show me how to drive in, right? Yes. You will drive directly his way. But look. I don't know, guys... If the enemy UAV takes off, it will look not from above, but straight ahead. The front of the vehicle might be visible. I'll check again. The front of the vehicle... We'll cover the whole vehicle with branches now. No problem. Everything is going exactly as we practiced. We've been training for more than a month. Why are we training? To do our job well. Caption: BM-21 &quot;Grad&quot; Gunner, callsign &quot;Archik&quot; If we don't do our job well, what will we have? Mistakes. If we have mistakes, what does it mean? It means we won't be able to hit these fools as effectively. Each crew is like a small family. That is, everyone is friendly, everyone has brotherly relationships. Each crew completely trusts and supports each other in any difficult situation. The battery, which lives together, consists of such small families that unite into one big friendly family. I oriented the artillery compass on the terrain. BM-21 &quot;Grad&quot; Topographical surveyor, callsign &quot;Stryker&quot; Next, the command was &quot;To battle.&quot; In coordination with the commander and the gunner, we orient ourselves to each other. The vehicle on the compass, the compass on the vehicle. Next part is a job of a gunner. The main thing is the numbers. So that your hand movements are precise, and you can immediately understand approximately what numbers you'll need, and after the practice shots, you already understand what corrections you'll make, and so on. We've been working on this for more than a month to achieve a good result. Plus-plus! It burned down, brother. That's it? Okay, let's go. After shooting, I didn't relax. I tried to stay focused because that's only half of my job after shooting. I still need to safely bring back the crew and the combat vehicle. Come on, brother, look from that side. The guys love their country. The girls love their country. From the very first days... They showed patriotism, love. They don't want, and we don't want to live in Russia. I don't want the Russian ruble, I want the Ukrainian hryvnia, and I want my children to speak Ukrainian in school, to read Ukrainian, to watch movies in Ukrainian. This is one of the most important things. In Azov there is an opportunity that you will serve with your friends in the same unit. You already trust these people, and you already know each other well. And the work will be more effective because you understand each other with half a word. There is an opportunity to be in the same unit with your friends, acquaintances, relatives... With anyone. Even with your mom. Yes, please. Even with your mom. If you want to be with your mom, you can be with your mom. No problem. I think the recruiting center will understand.
