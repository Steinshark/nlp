RUDY GIULIANI: Thank you. JUDY WOODRUFF: You said earlier today that country. What do you make of the findings in terms RUDY GIULIANI: Well, what I meant by that So, there never should have been an investigation. I think that they came to the conclusion definitively the conclusion that they could not charge And then the attorney general and Rod Rosenstein, punted it to them to make the decision, came that there is no element of obstruction here. just to prove -- I guess maybe I was in an I was on the campaign for four or five months. of some kind of collusion with Russians. It's been mystified as to how this could be. JUDY WOODRUFF: How comfortable are you concluding on the Russia collusion question, but on obstruction said he couldn't reach a conclusion about RUDY GIULIANI: I'm not troubled at all. First of all, here's the big takeaway. There There was no crime committed. They were investigating So, as the attorney general points out in it is very, very hard to commit obstruction It is hard to prove the intent for obstruction is very hard to do. traditionally are required for obstruction He didn't destroy evidence, as Hillary Clinton 1.4 million documents. He turned every message, There isn't a single thing they didn't get. object to any of the witnesses. He could have. to almost every witness. President Trump didn't object to anyone testifying. JUDY WOODRUFF: Two other quick questions, One is, you and the president's other attorneys with the special counsel, Robert Mueller. RUDY GIULIANI: Sure. JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you believe that any of findings would be different, had the president RUDY GIULIANI: No. They have all the -- they have given, had he sat down for an interview. The president has given them on numerous occasions, us a question that they needed an answer to. him for the purpose of trapping him into perjury. JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you are saying that Mueller you said they were setting a perjury trap? (CROSSTALK) RUDY GIULIANI: Yes. You are darn right they didn't act honorably. in solitary confinement. They go question lie. JUDY WOODRUFF: But is there a... RUDY GIULIANI: After a while -- after a while... JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there... RUDY GIULIANI: After a while, that gets close The first four times -- the first four times you it didn't happen the way you want me to getting pretty darn close to suborning perjury. JUDY WOODRUFF: So you are saying they didn't correct one. I mean, is that a contradiction? RUDY GIULIANI: They had no choice. Not at all. They had no choice. What are they There is no evidence. They can't create it. was cleared by a biased staff, because, hard ignored, they couldn't get what they needed, There was no collusion, and there was no obstruction. JUDY WOODRUFF: Will the president, do you and found guilty under -- by Robert Mueller, anybody else? RUDY GIULIANI: I was asked that question by I was asked that question by some lawyers. The president is not going to consider pardons. happens, it has to happen in the future, and assume it. But he -- obviously, he has power to do it. to exercise it. JUDY WOODRUFF: Former New York City Mayor thank you very much. RUDY GIULIANI: Thanks, Judy. Thank you. Thank JUDY WOODRUFF: From Mayor Giuliani, we turn answered and unanswered by the attorney general's And we do that with Mary McCord. She's the national security in the Obama administration. Miller, he was the spokesman for the Department Robert Ray, he was the independent counsel Whitewater investigation. And C. Boyden Gray, George H.W. Bush. We welcome all of you to the program. Thank So, we just heard from Mayor Giuliani. But what I want to ask -- talk to all of you actually how little we know, because it is given us from the Mueller report. First of all, about conspiracy, whether there and what you have is a conclusion from the investigation, Matthew Miller, the conclusion They don't use the word collusion, but nothing So, does Mr. Barr's summary answer all your MATTHEW MILLER: No, not at all. I think it answers the most significant question, Was he ready to charge a crime in court that respect to conspiracy with the Russian government campaign? And the answer to that question is no. It there was, you know, other types of collusion, of whether he thought that it happened, but evidence at all. I think the questions that the American people to have, and that hopefully will be answered they show? How much evidence was there? Did they have a theory that there was in some had the Trump campaign that knew what the publicly, that encouraged them privately at was a candidate who would back policies they And so, while there was no crime that was in the open, where both sides knew what the in a way that would encourage it. JUDY WOODRUFF: Robert Ray, what about that, ROBERT RAY: Well, the last part of that, I And that is not what prosecutors do. Prosecutors decided, based upon an investigation, and a lot of subpoenas, and a lot of documents, or not you have a case in good faith that a jury, and that a jury would unanimously determination would be sustained on appeal. That is all a prosecutor does, gathers facts And the judgment here with regard to collusion, the election is that members of the Trump not a sustainable case, meaning there's not was committed there. That's telling you a fair amount. Does it JUDY WOODRUFF: Right. ROBERT RAY: I imagine, in the next couple a disclosure in some fashion of the report general, because that's what the attorney There are certain impediments we can talk JUDY WOODRUFF: Right. ROBERT RAY: ... about how it's not going to the attorney general. But I imagine, if the attorney general is -- it will be transparent. JUDY WOODRUFF: Mary McCord, what about this? I mean, as you look at this, how many questions summary satisfy you? MARY MCCORD: Well, obviously, it's very limited, -- the other panelists have said about some And I think another point, to be clear, is or more people to commit a crime or to defraud in saying, of course, that prosecutors have could be met by evidence beyond -- that would they can bring charges. So, what this is saying is -- and what the that A.G. Barr included in his letter to Congress that members of the Trump campaign had conspired So -- and, again, conspired meaning to commit that the -- and intent that the goal of the So, that's very different than sort of public approval of it or a desire for it to continue. coming to an agreement to commit a crime. JUDY WOODRUFF: Or the president, Boyden Gray, the crowd in general, or -- and to -- he said turn up Hillary Clinton's e-mails. I mean, there's a difference here. C. BOYDEN GRAY, Former White House Counsel: what he says publicly and what he actually aides do or did or did not do. That's what really -- what really matters. of the investigation, which was that here's to do. And so that creates a suspicion. And what I find so difficult about that is, thing that hurts the Russians most, that brought is press our energy policy to really endanger So, he was not doing Putin's bidding. And beginning. JUDY WOODRUFF: You're talking about policy C. BOYDEN GRAY: Yes. JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's -- I mean, there's have the whole report. We have the summary But let's turn now to the other principal has to do with obstruction of justice. The while the report did not conclude that the neither did it exonerate him. But the attorney general also wrote that he of President Trump on this question, that That was enough to spark opposing reactions DONALD TRUMP: There was no obstruction, and total exoneration. It's a shame that our country REP. JERROLD NADLER (D), New York: These conclusions the fact that Mueller uncovered evidence that, Given these questions, it is imperative that and the underlying evidence. JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Robert Ray, what are we ROBERT RAY: I mean, I just say, on that point, out exonerations. You don't typically get an exoneration card from Uncle Sam for investigating you to say, didn't find anything, and not only are we you, but we're going to hold a press conference That typically does not happen. So, I mean, upon a prosecutorial determination by the in connection with the collusion piece, or that he's been vindicated, because the department to proceed with a prosecution, right? Exoneration is more of the political notion -- the president's position -- I was right And with regard to obstruction, as he's been previously, lookit, how -- how can you be as a practical matter, that didn't have foundation JUDY WOODRUFF: But if you -- but when you Matt Miller, saying, I don't know -- I can't on both sides, it's difficult, and then the this way, what do we make of that? MATTHEW MILLER: I find the attorney general's troubling, because we don't know why the special I doubt very much he didn't make the decision he thought it -- thought it was difficult. for the Justice Department to make that decision, a decision, or at least made a recommendation It's very unusual for a decision to come to from the prosecutors down the line. I suspect -- and I think we will see this Bob Mueller didn't make a prosecutorial determination Justice Department's opinion is that the president there's no reason for the special counsel In fact, there are good reasons for him not ROBERT RAY: Although he -- the attorney general (CROSSTALK) MATTHEW MILLER: Well, into his -- into the into the special counsel's determination. ROBERT RAY: Well, I -- but I think there's what Bob Mueller was confronted with. And I think we -- I think -- I agree with We don't quite know the answer to it. MATTHEW MILLER: Right. ROBERT RAY: But I would suggest that, in that that's created too, by virtue of an investigation and evaluating conduct relative to the obstruction And, as Attorney General Barr in his now famous confirmation explained, there's a substantial conduct. When he is the executive branch, JUDY WOODRUFF: And that is... ROBERT RAY: ... for any reason or for no reason And to try to then evaluate that in terms to make an obstruction -- obstruction case, not only legal -- not only factual barriers legal hurdles to overcome. And from a policy perspective, I think it speak with one voice. And that voice should of this investigation on the obstruction piece but this is precedent that will be used and to evaluate presidential conduct in terms JUDY WOODRUFF: And I want -- Boyden Gray, attorney general weighed in on one side or doesn't that -- isn't it going to continue want to call it, over this determination? C. BOYDEN GRAY: I don't see how. I don't see counsel decides he cannot prosecute, for whatever felt he couldn't indict a sitting -- I think Once that happens, it's really over. I do and the attorney general both, the deputy outcome, because that means the top leadership backing up Mueller's findings. But it is absolutely and definitely not the to exonerate or convict anybody. Only a jury to even mention exoneration, because no prosecutor JUDY WOODRUFF: Mary McCord, how do you read MARY MCCORD: Well, I would also agree there's includes President Trump and his counsel shouldn't Clearly, what the special counsel said is, clear. That's quoted by A.G. Barr in his letter I think what's -- I think we're not going more of the report, why Bob Mueller decided be -- have to do with the fact that the DOJ wanted to put this decision to Congress. It could be because he reports to the attorney it was A.G. Barr, when A.G. Sessions was recused. this significance should be made by the attorney I think, though, that what we haven't yet that there is evidence here that at least And the A.G. then made the determination, says is a very limited kind of understanding to come down with the fact that the evidence Reasonable minds may differ with that if they (CROSSTALK) JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as we said, he was joined (CROSSTALK) ROBERT RAY: Yes, and I think that's about C. BOYDEN GRAY: It's not for the Congress. Some talk yesterday, throughout the day was, Barr can't do it. No, Congress doesn't prosecute. But they can high crimes and misdemeanors. But for an actual ROBERT RAY: Oh, and I totally agree with that. And I think it would have been a mistake, General Barr should not have stepped into Bob Mueller to refrain from... JUDY WOODRUFF: The uncertainty. ROBERT RAY: Leave the uncertainty there. JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes. ROBERT RAY: I think you're absolutely correct. MATTHEW MILLER: He could... ROBERT RAY: The job of the special counsel's under the special counsel regulations, is to be made. JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, now we're going after what we know right now, for the legal, Congressional reaction, we have been talking lines, some Republicans questioning the very place. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South Carolina: A to protect the entity being targeted by a How did it fail and break down here? Was it know, but I'm going to try to find out. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority Leader: the report itself. So it's evident, it is interest for the Mueller report to be released JUDY WOODRUFF: And I want to bring in now you just saw in that &quot;Frontline&quot; documentary. The &quot;NewsHour&quot;'s Lisa Desjardins, she's at joins us from the White House. And Robert of &quot;Washington week,&quot; he's with us tonight Hello to all of you. And, Yamiche, I want to turn to you. We have been talking about the president's to be more to see. What is the White House see, whether we should see the entire Mueller YAMICHE ALCINDOR: So, the president has been That began this weekend when he learned that he colluded with Russia in order to interfere the fact that Attorney General Barr, of course, of him obstructing justice. However, the president earlier, before we that he thought that the Mueller report should walking that back. Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, and there might -- it might be in the best presidency if the report did not come out. So, what we have is the White House both saying the report, hold on a minute, we might not And I want to remind people that there's a both -- both from Republicans, but also from And just as I was walking over here, there's away from me that said, &quot;We the people demand So there's fever pitch feelings here that but no clear answers here. JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins at the Capitol, LISA DESJARDINS: I can tell you, just in the a clear signal from Democrats. The five Democratic chairmen of the House area -- that includes committees like Oversight, a joint letter to the attorney general tonight. And they have said in these words that they they have given him a deadline of April 2. So it's not clear what would happen if the But they write -- and this goes to some of write that Congress is permitted the ability independently. And they are asserting what they believe is rather eye-popping letter. They also write, House chairmen -- they say: &quot;We have no reason -- that he has made well-considered prosecutorial They say, one, whether the Trump campaign the charges against the Russians. They're not questioning whether there was any collusion That's where the focus of Democrats are going. internal battle for Democrats between cautious are the voices pushing for dogged pursuit. couple of days after this. JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Robert Costa, who's also lot of reporting since word of the report had been turned over to the Justice Department. What are you hearing about just how partisan, releasing the report and what to do about ROBERT COSTA: It's not only partisan, but on Capitol Hill, who want to pursue further Yet, when it comes to obstruction of justice, Was the intent corrupt? Robert Mueller, the on that front. And it will be difficult for subpoena power, to figure out President Trump's So they would like to paint a fuller picture want to see the full report. But whether it that remains to be seen. JUDY WOODRUFF: And back to Yamiche on that. Is the White House breathing easy? Have they table because of this? YAMICHE ALCINDOR: The sense I have gotten that the Mueller report is over and that this They're not quite breathing easy in the idea are essentially now on the defense. They feel They think, before the Mueller report, there on the part of the president. He didn't speak all weekend, didn't make any report had been filed. And that's because would say. Now that the White House has seen the summary feel as though they're in a good position, the president now feels like he has the political And I should note that the president's political they have actually started fund-raising off two years, while he was busy really ushering So they're also using this as a campaign rallying JUDY WOODRUFF: All right. Yamiche Alcindor Capitol, Robert Costa joining us, all three, And I finally come back to our panel here Let's go back at, Mary McCord, this question see, should see, needs to see, in order to counsel concluded. MARY MCCORD: So, certainly, the attorney general with an eye toward disclosing publicly as -- is in the public interest to disclose. And there's things he does have to take into rules. And those rules are there for a reason, particularly a criminal investigation, although by the mandate of appointing the special counsel, a prosecution, this all remains secret, because sort of any dirty laundry in there. I think it's a very -- when the decision was to charge a crime. JUDY WOODRUFF: Right. MARY MCCORD: I think we're in a very different president of the United States is the person, He is -- he is campaigning for reelection public trust associated with it. And I think is this delta between no evidence and evidence, doubt each and every element of the crime. JUDY WOODRUFF: Boyden Gray, how much does C. BOYDEN GRAY: Oh, well, I would like -- I'm I think the president all the way down and to see the whole thing. But, as you have said, are problems possibly with sources and methods, So, there may be some redaction. But I think it -- make it very, very clear that I agree today, that, if we're going to have full disclosure, of the FISA warrants, the background of Mueller's dossier. All of that must be equally disclosed, as JUDY WOODRUFF: But that's not part of the be additional investigation. C. BOYDEN GRAY: It's... (CROSSTALK) JUDY WOODRUFF: Or is it? C. BOYDEN GRAY: I would think it is part of JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm asking. C. BOYDEN GRAY: It's part -- maybe -- maybe was part of the charge. And if it wasn't, let's find out why it wasn't. we need to know what the charge was. And we that were issued under his name. JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly, Matt Miller, MATTHEW MILLER: Those questions about the in any event, they're under investigation That report will be public at some point. With respect to what ought to be made public possible ought to be made public, maybe with one thing the department has made clear from are not the final arbiter of presidential And for Congress to make that decision, they about what the president did. And one of things tonight, we talk about whether the president's That's not the only standard for presidential Congress has to assess the entire matter. JUDY WOODRUFF: Just 15 seconds. ROBERT RAY: I don't agree with that. I don't emphasis in the Constitution is on high crimes I think the... MATTHEW MILLER: But it's not the criminal ROBERT RAY: The impeachment inquiry is going of the special counsel and the Justice Department And that -- that's going to slow that train (CROSSTALK) JUDY WOODRUFF: So much to talk about. Robert Ray, Boyden Gray, Mary McCord, Matthew That is it for now. We thank you for joining
