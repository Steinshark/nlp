[train whistling] Where most saw a dorky hobby, they saw the potential [trains crashing They even wrote a dictionary applying ingenuity to or as they called it, &quot;Hacking.&quot; [ upbeat rock music ] And just like that, the world's first computer [ rhythmic beat ] [train whistling] [train chugging] [ upbeat music ] [buttons beeping] [whooshing sound] [Narrator] The years passed and hackers found on the personal computer. There they that they knew best, networks. Nothing had changed. They were still testing Only now networks had Banking. Transport. Agriculture. Governments. Suddenly, hackers had the power to derail much more [ dramatic music , Some used that power Heavily funded nation criminal gangs stole millions and then, they came for people. The data of billions of users who rely on the internet And who could stop them? The only ones who like the attackers. [keys typing] Those who were in order to make it safer, the ones who saw the a network worth protecting. [ anthemic music ] When it's your job to keep you have to live and just like the attackers do because the only way is to think like one. [footsteps clacking] [ 'The Wheel' by SOHN ] [silence] [Heather] This is [Director laughs] [Director] Just another [Heather laughs] [Heather] My name I'm a VP of Security When I have to tell it's really difficult. It's really complicated. So I usually just tell them that I keep the And I think most people [door clicking] [Narrator] Heather every security role leading teams on the front lines against the company If you've heard of it, she's defended against it. And if you haven't heard of it, you can thank her for that too. So when you wanna know about in Google's history, there's probably no one than her. [Heather] Let's see what Um... [Narrator] What better intro Than the song of the summer. [ 'Bulletproof' by La Roux , [Narrator] Welcome to 2009. [ I'll be bulletproof ] [Heather] 2009 was an [Reporter 1] Google.

Honestly, I I mean, I thought okay, one That sucks, right? My day sucks. But literally by the It was a server that It was tucked away in a And the attacker had really [ dramatic music ] [Eric] We could see right away. I mean, there should not That just shouldn't [Narrator] This is Eric Grosse. He was the head of Google's Privacy when all of [Eric] We did not have playbooks for how to deal with all this. [ dramatic music , [Heather] This wasn't an The speed and the ability to learn on the fly, change their tactics. It was extraordinary. It was different. It was unique. [Eric] I mean, my world We dropped everything [ upbeat music ] [Tim] The following [call ringing] [Caller] "Tim, can you There's a few of us here [Tim] I was like okay. By the third day, I just went I didn't even go And that's where I sat for I think the next [Heather] The with one dedicated And that quickly grew into then four conference rooms and then suddenly [Narrator] They came by plane, train, automobile and [bike bell ringing] Traveling in person or dialing in daily.

[Darren] I was on so I did some of attempting to do [modem sounds] [fist banging] But pretty soon it became, I booked the first flight, turn up in Mountain [Mike] I remember landing and from that point, we were at like 100 miles an hour and it didn't slow down [Narrator] A patchwork from around the globe. Heather raised Googlers answered. And she immediately [Mike] It definitely felt like Heather handed me and said, &quot;Go get them. Go haul hard drives out of And this is in the So we hop in the rental car and we're driving around We've got a bunch running through buildings, capturing machines to First, we started then pull the hard drives out but we decided that So we were just [Darren] Just and leaving a post-it [laughs] "Security was here. Please call this number." [Mike] We had a and a stack of machines [Darren] By that stage, we had a number of people just kind of churning through, looking at the different systems and figuring out like, "What [Narrator] While the team around the clock. Heather raised the alarm for others in the industry. [phone vibrating] [Dmitri] I got this who wanted to chat with me about something that they [Narrator] Enter He's the chairman of a global cybersecurity But back in 2009, he at a security firm What began as turned into partnership were willing to roll [Dmitri] Google shared Zeros and ones effectively. So we immediately to dissect that exploit, And most of it is mumbo if they're not But occasionally you that will be The word Aurora in those first minutes of [Narrator] Aurora. Why would that Well... [ 'Marche Slave, Op. 31' October 1917. A shot rings out [cannon booming] The shell was empty. The message wasn't. A shot that would start [film whirring] And forever change the And the name of the battleship You guessed it. Aurora. [Dmitri] When I saw it, that we had to name the [ Russian music remixed ] just as the fired a single shot resonating decades afterward-- [Dmitri] Operation Aurora had a similar effect. The world has changed. We had to change everything to cyber security to deal [machine buzzing] [ pensive music ] [Heather] When you get attacked, it's a bit like playing If your opponent opposite you knows every move it's going to be for them to to checkmate. We wanted to keep that for as long as possible by studying as much as and then instantaneously. [ suspenseful music ] [Narrator] The team to keep the investigation [Eric] We pretty much had to [Narrator] There of who could come in or out. [Heather] We would put security a little bit You had to kind of [Narrator] Even cleaning in the main war room. [Darren] Pizza boxes kind of spread [Heather] It was smelly [Narrator] They with each other online. [Heather] Just in case The access controls to [Tim] We had Senior VPs, we had the founders of the company with us. It was--you know, [ dramatic music ] [Heather] As you're of how the attacker is working, it's a rush of adrenaline because you can of how to eradicate [Narrator] The team narrowed in, set traps and positioned on the attacker. There was only holiday break. [ festive music ] [Heather] We always wonder if the attackers picked [Mike] They know most people during the holidays. [Heather] It wasn't where something [Narrator] Just before the team pivoted. [Heather] We suddenly to be very radical [Narrator] So what was [Mike] We knew we had to get We had to make the biggest to our infrastructure and we had to do it [Narrator] And who for pulling the trigger? [Tim] I drew the short straw, so part of my role was really to from the network. [Narrator] That's right. Everybody. Google engineers, security researchers even Heather. [Heather] Yeah. [Narrator] Were to be and their passwords reset. [Tim] I did not make any friends at the company over Christmas. [Narrator] This to make absolutely sure that at Google were And with that the team hit go. [ 'Carol of the Bells' Systematically from all systems all at once. The attacker was banished [ pensive music ] But one question still remained: who was behind this attack? [keys typing] [Heather] On January Google announced it had and targeted attack. [Dmitri] It was shocking. Google was one of the that voluntarily disclosed [Heather] And in the we found that at least were compromised as well. We were able to lend some [Dmitri] Not only did they that they'd been hacked but for the first time, they were able to [ suspenseful music , [Nicole Wong] In mid-December, we detected a and targeted attack on our originating from China. We discovered in that the accounts of around the world who advocate for human rights appeared to have been [Jay Carney] The President As with all intrusions, we employ an with the appropriate In this case, the FBI is [Reporter] Now, the cyber and may have [Eric] I didn't that a foreign military and now they obviously are.

[Eric] We view it between these very capable and individuals who can't to defend against that. We chose to stand in between. [Heather] We stopped them. But I'm not convinced that [ lively music ] [footsteps clattering, [Heather] So we start making radical changes, not just rebuilding things the way that we but we wanted to do things Ways people have never ways attackers had We were gonna change [ dramatic music ] I'm realistic that there will be threat actors who want to do But if they do try again, I want them to have [ pensive music ] [ anthemic music ] [Shane] The primary is to understand the attacker so we can counter them and we can protect [Toni] Um... We're dark [Shane] [Camille] Ransomware. [Toni] Phishing messages. [Camille] It's essentially [Shane] Hostile to interfere with elections. [Toni] It's not around the people that of the newspaper.
