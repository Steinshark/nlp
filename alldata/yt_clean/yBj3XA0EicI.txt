Hello! Today, we're going to try and talk about the Vikings. Here's our main Viking, who, for some reason, doesn't want to stay in the frame, although he could, and it would actually be great to have him here. There are countless legends about the Vikings, and their image has been heavily romanticized. While preparing for this show, I realized that the best modern-day comparison we can draw from the modern era about the Vikings' history is to organized crime groups. Yes, at first glance, you might think, "What? Criminal gangs from the '90s and Vikings?" But in reality, criminals and gangsters have, without even knowing it, borrowed a lot from the Vikings, and today, we'll try to break it all down step by step. So, let's figure out where these Vikings even came from. When you watch a movie or read semi-historical articles or websites about the Vikings, there's this story: Norwegian Vikings, Danish Vikings, Swedish Vikings, By the time we're talking about, the 8th century, there were no such countries as Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and certainly not Iceland. What existed was a large historical community that we can call Scandinavians today. Europeans referred to them as Normans, meaning "people from the North." In Rus, ancient Russia, they would later be called Varangians, but no one at the time differentiated between Swedes, Danes, or Norwegians for the reasons I just mentioned. Now, let's take a look at what Europe looked like in 793, the year that marks the Vikings' appearance on the European stage. In Europe, there are several powerful states. First, there's the Kingdom of the Franks, ruled by Charlemagne, one of the greatest monarchs of all time. Arabs had also arrived poiavliaiutsia araby, kotorye zakhvatyvaiut in Europe, taking over the Iberian Peninsula, which was fully under Arab control -- no Spain or Portugal yet. Then there's Byzantium, the remnant of the great Roman Empire. No one really knows much about seafaring, and this will be the Vikings' key advantage. Some trade is done with carts, but it's very disorganized. However, the climate is mild, allowing for farming and grain production. There's hunting, fishing -- all the usual activities. Now, you understand what the Scandinavian Peninsula is like. It's a harsh, inhospitable land, with not much there. Of course, there's hunting and gathering, and some subsistence farming, but the land is much poorer than mainland Europe. Culturally, it's less developed; the Franks already have laws, the Franks have a writing system, the Franks have a religion, a state with taxes and levies, and an army -- none of which the Vikings have. These tribes lived in relative poverty. That popular image of a Viking roasting meat over a fire -- well, dear friends, to roast meat, you need to hunt down a moose, and that's no easy feat either. Why did they use axes, like these Viking-style axes, for instance? It wasn't out of choice. Swords were expensive, and a Frankish sword was nearly impossible to get. So, they had axes, and later they developed helmets and other gear. At this point, Viking society was still a loosely organized, free community, and this is important. It was a society of free people. They lived in neighboring fjords, and while it was possible to farm or trade with each other, what would you actually trade? If you have a moose, and your neighbor in the next fjord also has a moose, or you both have the same grains -- there's little incentive for trade among yourselves. So, this led to trading beyond their shores, pushing the Vikings across the sea. Now, in any society, a ruling class eventually emerges. How does it happen? It comes about through the right of strength. In early medieval times, and really all of the Middle Ages, society operated on a simple principle: you only held property as long as you could defend it. This is, by the way, a totally gangster-like mentality. If you can "hold your ground" and defend your assets, then they're yours. If not, stronger people would come and take them from you. The same happened with the Vikings. They formed gangs, and every gang had a leader who provided for his people, led them into battle, and they would share the spoils amongst themselves. This is how the first elite class emerged among the Scandinavians -- or Normans, as we'll call them. Naturally, this elite class began fighting each other in civil wars. But remember, in war, the most important thing isn't victory -- the most important thing is the spoils of war. You kill your neighbors, march into their fjord, maybe steal a couple of goats or three sheep, but you've lost four of your own men -- how is that good business? Of course, it's not, and this was one of the first reasons why the Vikings needed to look beyond their borders. The second reason was overpopulation, but specifically within the elite class. What does this mean? Well, let's say there's a certain Harold the Fat, and across from him, there's Sigurd the Slim. Each of them has three sons, but only one son inherits. The rest -- sorry, but you're on your own. Do whatever you want, because only the eldest son inherits -- that's how Germanic law worked at the time. The Vikings, being of Germanic origin, had the same legal customs. So, what's a middle son supposed to do? He's still part of the elite, a jarl or konung's son. But what does that give him? Is he supposed to herd goats? No, he's not going to herd goats -- he's going to go to war. He gathers his own band of warriors. But again, they can't plunder their neighbors, because there's nothing to take. This is the second reason for looking abroad. The third reason? The ship. Here in my hand is a piece of wood, which, of course, has absolutely nothing to do with Viking ships. But take a look at what a drakkar, the primary warship of the Vikings, looked like. It could sail forward with the bow and backward with the stern, giving it incredible mobility. The second key feature was the sail. Look at the Viking sails -- they were made of wool. Why were they colorful? They were sewn together from different pieces of wool. Now, this piece I'm holding has no oars, but the drakkar would have had oars. Building such a ship, with its single, massive keel, was comparable to building a spacecraft in the 20th century. It was a tremendous advantage -- granting them incredible mobility and speed. Of course, speed in their context, not by today's standards. For example, historians believe that under favorable winds, you could sail from Norway to Iceland on a drakkar in about five days, and under bad conditions, maybe a week or 10 days. They covered enormous distances. The ship was constructed in such a way -- look at how its planks were arranged -- that it was incredibly flexible, Now, compared to modern ships or even those from the 15th to 17th centuries, the drakkar was quite pitiful. A strong gust of wind could generate waves large enough to flip the ship. But despite these limitations, these ships were built, and the Scandinavians learned how to sail them. They realized that after mastering travel from fjord to fjord, they could venture much farther. These three factors drove the Scandinavians outward, pushing them to discover new lands. In 814, the death of Charlemagne triggered the breakup of the Frankish Empire into three kingdoms. During Charlemagne's reign, attacking the Franks would've been disastrous, as they had a standing army that could cut you down and even a navy of sorts. But after his death, as control over territories weakened, the Vikings found an opportunity. But before we dive into the Viking raids, let's take a closer look at how these fascinating people lived. First of all, what is a Viking? Initially, "Viking" didn't refer to a nation, clan, or even a family -- it referred to a raid. To "go Viking" meant to embark on an expedition, and not just any exploratory expedition, but specifically a raiding expedition. takoe banditstvo, banditizm. To est' eto uiti So, it was essentially a form of banditry, a raiding expedition for spoils. There were different types of expeditions: some were trade voyages, others aimed at discovering and conquering new lands, but the majority were raiding expeditions, and I'll explain why in a bit. Now, let's talk about the way of life for the Normans, the Vikings. Their existence was fairly modest -- hunting, some farming, fishing, and raising livestock. In other words, their economy was quite primitive. The foundation of Scandinavian society was the family. An independent person, along with their relatives, would cultivate the land and fish, and they all lived together in large households -- parents, sons, wives, daughters. Essentially, the core of Viking society was the clan or family. These people were free -- there was no serfdom, no taxes or duties to be paid. Family ties were important at all levels of Scandinavian society, and this played a key role, especially when it came to legal matters. If you were on trial, it really mattered how many relatives and friends could vouch for you and stand by your side. This is a characteristic of Germanic law. Guilt didn't always depend on actual wrongdoing. Say you stole a cow and were summoned to court, but you looked respectable and spoke well, and 20 of your buddies patsanov prikhodiat i govoriat: <<Nu, postoite, showed up and said, &quot;Come on, how could Ingvar have stolen a cow? Are you crazy? He's a great guy, we all know him, all 20 of us! We can vouch for him, he is totally a great guy.&quot; Meanwhile, the actual victim might be meekly claiming, &quot;But the cow was stolen...&quot; and you'd respond, &quot;No, you must be mistaken -- it wandered into my yard by itself.&quot; Despite their reputation as bloodthirsty and ruthless people -- without exaggeration -- the most severe punishment in their internal justice system was exile. They had no death penalty, while the rest of Europe handed out executions as casually as pouring a glass of water. In Viking society, this wasn't the case. Another interesting point is the role of women. We know that today there's one situation with women's status, but throughout history, women were often relegated to secondary or even lower roles in society. There are sayings from those times that suggested, if you had to choose between losing a horse or a woman, you'd lose the woman because she only bore children, while a horse could carry you anywhere. However, within Viking families, women. were considered equal members of society. They didn't rule or participate in legal proceedings, but they had full control over their property and, most importantly, over themselves. If a woman no longer wanted to live with her husband -- say, Ingvar with his long beard -- she could simply say, &quot;Goodbye, we're done here.&quot; And that was that -- they divorced. And this is quite remarkable for the early Middle Ages. The fact that among the Vikings you had free people, free women, and a full form of democracy, similar to what was happening in some Islamic societies, is astonishing. For instance, when they gathered for a thing (an assembly), where all the families -- say, 120 of them -- came together to make decisions. They would discuss important issues, like trade, or important state-related decisions, or how to divide lands, and more trivial matters. It was the only real example of democracy in that period. Just look at where Scandinavia went from there, as this democratic spirit continued to evolve and flourish. It all started with the Vikings, which is truly amazing. Vikings were also known for their love of boisterous feasts. Their most sacred celebration was Yule -- the winter solstice, which takes place in December. On that day, Vikings would gather for a grand feast to welcome the return of the sun. They had their own rules for these meals, as described in one of the sagas: "For the kings who lived on their estates and hosted feasts, only men and women who were couples could drink from the same cup. But for the Vikings, the law was that everyone at the feast drank from a single cup, meaning the cup symbolized their unity. Speaking of celebrations and traditions, let's not forget about gifts. A memorable one would certainly be the smooth taste of an eight-year-old Scotch whisky, achieved through double aging. Not just whisky, but history in a bottle. A few words about Viking homes: these were often built from woven branches or clay, with a communal hearth at the center where the feasts took place. Their homes were quite humble. Vikings didn't have money, nor did they mint their own coins, which is surprising but true. Instead, they relied on various valuable items -- metal axes, Frankish swords, or perhaps a Frankish helmet -- those were their treasures, worth more than money. Skins were also considered valuable. As for currency, all the money they used came from elsewhere -- Arabian coins, Frankish coins. Bukhara coins were especially prized, likely because they contained more gold. Without their own currency, they stored their wealth in these foreign currencies, which is an interesting fact. As for their language, the Vikings spoke Old Norse, a North Germanic language, which was spoken throughout all regions of Scandinavia. In writing, it takes the form of runes. And here's another fascinating story. You won't believe it, but there's something you use daily called &quot;Bluetooth.&quot; It's also connected to the Vikings. You'll find out why at the end of the episode. So, what are runes? It's a mistake to simply call them an alphabet. Runes are not just letters; they are magical symbols, magical signs, and mystical inscriptions. For example, this is why it was so important for a Viking to properly bury an ancestor and place a rune-inscribed stone on the grave. You've probably heard this well-known fact that there are runes on the walls of Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. Vikings carved messages like with their axes. There's a similar stone in Athens. They would come, stir things up, take some loot, and leave an inscription: "Olaf was here.&quot; That's it. However, rune stones on graves had a completely different function because they were connected to Viking mythology. Viking mythology was quite brutal. You probably know about Thor, Odin, and Loki. These beings -- or rather, these gods -- belonged to the Norse-Germanic pantheon. The gods were very human-like. They fought with each other, drank, stole things from one another, and Loki, well, he was pretty much a scam artist. But the entire pantheon had a dark undertone. So, what is the significance of a rune stone on an ancestor's grave? It was crucial to bury an ancestor properly because if you didn't, they could rise from the grave and devour you -- after all, food was scarce, and you were right there. That's why it was essential to give your relative a &quot;proper send-off.&quot; They could actually rise and cause all sorts of trouble. These rune stones often bore inscriptions like &quot;Stay there.&quot; Well, maybe not exactly that, but they were incantations meant to seal the grave. Life for the Vikings was very simple -- there wasn't much land. If, for instance, you were walking with an axe and came across a stranger, you needed to fight them immediately and, ideally, kill them. Why? Well, if you don't know them, that likely means they're from a neighboring fjord, and they've come to take something from you, so you need to defend your property. But this stranger might not be just anyone from a fjord nearby -- they could be Thor. Or maybe Odin himself, who has taken on a human form. In that case, if they kill you, it's also a good thing because anyone who dies with a sword in hand, anyone who dies in battle, goes to Valhalla. Valhalla is somewhat like what Christians would call heaven, though not exactly. It's a great hall where the gods and the fallen warriors gather. They feast endlessly, They listen to sagas, skalds sing songs, and drink foamy mead -- this goes on forever. What's interesting, and it's not often mentioned, is that two categories of the dead made it to Valhalla. The first category is warriors, and the second is women who died during childbirth. So, a woman who gave birth and died would also enter Valhalla. There, they all sit together -- women, men, the highest gods -- all feasting. It's an incredible thing, and there's nothing more glorious than dying with a sword in hand. In fact, living to old age was seen as quite unfortunate. If you became an old man, you were just a burden -- your children might support you, but you couldn't join in raids anymore. And the worst part is that when you die, you'll end up with a woman named Hel. That's where the word "hell" comes from -- a dark underworld with a deep, bluish, eggplant-colored gloom, a land of shadows. That's where you'll go, which is obviously depressing. Sigurd was a good man. He's 56 now, already an old man. It's sad he didn't die in battle. But what can you do? He's a good man, after all. This is why dying with a weapon in hand, dying on your last raid, is the greatest honor. There's nothing better. This attitude explains the ruthlessness and fearlessness of the Vikings -- what did they have to lose? At home, what did they have? A goat, a couple of clay pots, and a coin from Bukhara, which they called money. But in a raid, you could plunder anything you wanted, claim the best women. Or, if you got killed, you went to Valhalla. How could that be bad? Of course, it's good. This mentality was something entirely different from the rest of Europe, because Viking society viewed human life differently. This mythology is also tied to the concept of the &quot;berserker.&quot; According to legend -- and I've read about this often -- these were warriors so fearless in battle that they would fight relentlessly, even if they were being struck themselves. They were unstoppable, supposedly because they drank some special mushroom brew made from fly agaric mushrooms. Personally, I don't believe in the mushroom brew theory. I think these berserkers were just people with very volatile psyches who would enter a kind of frenzy during battle. You can even see this today in modern MMA fights. You can tell when a fighter is skilled and fighting with precision, and when someone enters a rage -- those are the ones who go wild. The berserkers were like that. They reached a kind of battle-induced ecstasy, maybe comparable to a sexual high, and would just charge at one another, fighting with total abandon, without really knowing what they were doing. They were a whole category of warriors, and sagas and legends were told about them. To wrap up the talk about Viking mythology, there was also one truly horrifying part of their beliefs: human sacrifice. There were first-level sacrifices, where they would kill a goat or a cow, and the priests would eat the offering. So, through these rituals, they were trying to appease the gods. There were human sacrifices -- at times they sacrificed their own tribesmen, sometimes even kings, well, not kings, they had konungs, to save their their land from terrible droughts. When the Vikings went to Europe, they had no hesitation in hanging people from trees like garlands as offerings to the god Odin. Why sacrifice their own when there were so many foreigners? And this is another point: the Vikings weren't monsters in the way we might think. They didn't go around saying, &quot;We're monsters, nice to meet you!&quot; -- no, that was just how they lived. They had a specific set of beliefs, and that was just the way it was. Human sacrifices, harsh lands, and the idea that the strongest rule by right of their strength. If you're weak, we're going to take everything from you. And then, of course, there were the ships I mentioned earlier. That was Viking society for you. I started talking about poetry. The Vikings didn't have literature because they didn't really have writing. Runes were used, but mostly for magical inscriptions. Then there are the sagas. There are two types: family sagas -- stories about someone like Rollo Blue-Belly and his journeys across the seas -- and fictional sagas, which would tell of Rollo Blue-Belly slaying a dragon during his overseas travels. Obviously, there were no dragons in sagas, but it might be some magical snake instead. Then there's skaldic poetry, which is truly a remarkable thing. At first glance, when you read it, it seems completely nonsensical because the real names of objects are substituted. For example, instead of &quot;ship,&quot; they would say &quot;the horse of the sea,&quot; or something like &quot;the bull of the sea.&quot; Instead of a man, they might say "the one who rides the bull of the sea," meaning a person sailing a ship. Everything is convoluted and lacks any kind of systematization, and nothing ever rhymes. Why were these sagas so long? Why was skaldic poetry even a thing? Winter, my friends. Winter -- what else was there to do? There was no Netflix, so instead of Netflix, they had skalds. The chieftain would sit at the head of the table, with common warriors here, and jarls over there. They'd roast an elk, eat, drink, and the chieftain would say, "Let's hear from the skald." Then the skald would go on for an hour and a half: &quot;Let me tell you a story...&quot; and off they went. Long winter nights with nothing to do. Later on, they'd bring chess. Later still, they'd bring some other board games. None of that existed yet. The only "tabletop game" was two Vikings cutting each other down over an argument. That was entertaining to watch, everyone found it exciting. But it's still bloodshed, and there weren't many people around. These were valuable warriors. Yet, people have always needed entertainment. You know, humanity loves to be entertained, and these skalds were as valued as strong warriors, because you could take a skald with you on a raid, on a voyage. While a terrible storm raged, while waves raged all around, with fog all around, , the skald would tell sagas to keep up the warriors' morale. That's why skalds were such important figures. On one hand, they entertained the Viking elite; on the other, they boosted morale. But most importantly for us, they passed down these tales orally, from generation to generation. There are two outstanding literary works: the Younger Edda and the Elder Edda. I'll come back to the Elder Edda later. These are essentially chronicles of gods and heroes. In every era, there have been professionals -- people who could skilfully do what others couldn't: build a house, launch a ship, fire clay, and so on. Today, in the 21st century, we need the services of professionals even more often. Everything around us could break in a second, and only a top-notch specialist can fix it properly. That's why I recommend everyone use the &quot;PROFI&quot; app, where specialists can help you with any task. &quot;PROFI&quot; is a service for finding professionals for all kinds of jobs: electricians, plumbers, hairdressers, tutors, videographers, children's party entertainers. Thanks to the convenient mobile app, you can quickly and easily find the right specialist. On the main page, you simply search for the service you need, for example, an electrician, answer a few follow-up questions, and select a date and time for the service. And the best part -- you can offer the price that works for you. It's all very convenient, and filling out the request takes just a few minutes. If you're a specialist yourself, there's a separate app called "PROFI for Pros," where you can easily register and find new clients. I'll leave links for both the client app and the specialist app in the description. Check them out, and now, back to history. A quick word on clothing: women's outfits were long dresses; peasants wore large shirts, burlap pants, stockings, and cloaks. Everything was quite primitive. A sign of elite status, for example, was an iron toothpick. Someone brought one back from a market or from some kind of a raid or an expedition, and in one burial site, they found two wealthy women buried together with a cart and horses. These were likely noble Viking women. And there was a toothpick, which was probably the equivalent of, say, a modern smartphone. Finally, the last point. A month ago on Instagram, I asked you what was wrong with this drawing of a Viking. Basically, everything. But the most important thing is the helmet with horns. People tend to think of Vikings as huge, rugged men with horned helmets. Well, first of all, they weren't huge -- they were actually quite short. Secondly, there were no horned helmets. I mean, just imagine: we're fighting in a line, and you poke me with your horn. What kind of battle would that be? I've got a shield and an axe here too! Indeed, horned helmets have been found in Viking burial sites, but most scholars now agree that these helmets were likely used for ritual purposes -- quite possibly, to ward off evil spirits or something of that nature. Excuse me, let the cat in, please, look at that. And so, the Vikings set out into the open seas. The &quot;drakkar&quot; is the ship I already mentioned. Why &quot;drakkar&quot;? Because it had a menacing dragon figurehead on its prow. The ship was about 18 to 20 meters long, able to hold up to 70 rowers. These rowers were also the warriors -- rowing their oars, then disembarking to hack down anyone they could. The top speed that modern scholars talk about was around 12 knots. For that time, it was a phenomenal, rocket-like speed. Another Viking ship, the &quot;snekkar,&quot; had around 60 rowers. And finally, there was the &quot;knarr,&quot; a ship used for trading. At first, when the Vikings ventured into the open sea, they began trading, bartering goods, and bringing them back to their lands, trading with Europeans. At some point, they realized that trade could only be profitable if it was slave trade. For example, they could capture slaves and sell them at Arab markets, transporting them as far as Bukhara. Though they didn't reach Bukhara right away, the profit margins were extraordinary. But at some point, the Vikings realized they didn't need to trade with these people -- the remnants of the Frankish Empire, the remnants of the Kingdom of Franks, They realized they could simply take everything by the sword, as these people didn't know how to fight. The Vikings could raid, cut everyone down, grab the loot, and sail away without facing much resistance. This marked the start of the Viking expansion, with the year 793 often considered to be the beginning of this era. This is island of Lindisfarne near England. That year, three Viking ships arrived there and utterly destroyed the unprotected monastery standing there, looted everything they could from the monastery and disappeared. The key advantage of the Vikings was their fast ships, which were also very low to the water, blending in with the waves. At that time, there were no lookout towers or fortified cities built at river mouths or bays where landings were convenient. None of that existed yet. So, the Vikings quickly figured out that they could swiftly arrive, cut everyone down, load their drakkar with as much loot as it could carry, and burn the rest. And so, the Vikings begin returning home, and it's nothing short of a celebration -- a life of glory. Look: goblets, Frankish swords, beautiful women, church relics, gold jewelry -- there it is, all the shiny loot. And what kind of economy did the Vikings have? It was a status-based economy. The more loot you had hanging on you, the more you could share with your comrades who went raiding with you, the greater your standing as a jarl or a konung. We tend to imagine these huge Viking armies attacking Europe, but in reality, there were only two or three armies in their history -- I'll tell more about them later. No, most of these were more like gangs -- 20, 30, or 40 men. It was like, &quot;Hey, guys, shall we go raiding? How about England? Last time we looted some monks there -- it was great, let's go again. Who's with us? Olaf, Harald, and who else? Oh, that one-eyed gut from the neighboring fjord, he's got 30 fighters too. Let's bring him along, he's a good guy.&quot; And so, this gang, living by their own rules, eager to die in battle, knowing no pity -- and most importantly, not bound by Christian beliefs -- burns churches and takes everything they can. These gangs start ravaging Europe. Take a look at what happens. In 793, they looted the monastery I mentioned earlier. By 795, the Vikings were landing in Ireland. In 800, they seized the Shetland and Orkney Islands, marking the beginning of the conquest of England. By 810, they were raiding Friesland. In 830, they reached the territory of France for the first time. By 839, they had established their first kingdom in Ireland, with its capital at Armagh. By 844, they were besieging Lisbon. Just think about it -- Norway and Denmark are so far from Lisbon! By 845, they were attacking Hamburg and Paris -- more on that later. Their raids focused on coastal regions. They'd arrive with 20 ships, land at the mouth of the Seine, burn something, and move on. They even made it to the Bay of Biscay, to San Sebastian, and all the way to Santiago de Compostela. They circled all of Europe in these small ships of theirs. If you open a map of Europe and look at where Denmark is, at where Norway is, at where Britain is, at where Spain is, you'll realize the challenge. Today, without GPS, it's tough to get from Denmark to Spain. But the Vikings managed to sail there on their ships. They attacked Spain from two coasts. First, they launched attacks along the Bay of Biscay, where the city of San Sebastian is today. They fortified themselves in France at the mouth of the Loire, and from there, they sailed along the coast to San Sebastian. There, in the Basque Country, there wasn't much for them to loot because the local population quickly fled to the mountains. So, they moved further into Galicia, a wealthy region. You all know Galicia -- it's home to Spain's most important pilgrimage site, Santiago de Compostela. Near Santiago, there's a massive Roman lighthouse called the Tower of Hercules. Here's how it looks in the picture. So, the Vikings dealt their first devastating blow to Galicia. The first assault was repelled -- they didn't capture any land and retreated back to their islands. Some sailed to Ireland, while others headed to the mouth of the Loire, where the Vikings had a base. In 844, the Vikings launched a terrifying raid on the territory that is now Spain and Portugal. It was one of the most dreadful raids in Viking history. They landed in Galicia, but didn't engage in any battles. They simply disembarked near the Tower of Hercules, burned nearby monasteries, looted them, and either killed or enslaved the locals. Next, with an estimated 50 to 80 ships, the Vikings sailed to Lisbon, which was then under the rule of Muslim emirs, the Arabs -- often referred to as Moors at the time. The garrison of Lisbon lasted less than two days. The Vikings captured the city and spent 13 days looting, raping, killing, and stealing everything they could. Afterward, they sailed their drakkars around Portugal and ended up in Andalusia. There, they traveled upriver to Seville. Although they didn't reach Seville right away, they captured an island called Isla Menor, where the Arab emirs of Cordoba bred purebred horses. The Vikings weren't particularly fond of horses, but they plundered the island nonetheless and set up camp there before launching an attack on Seville. They moved further upstream, and the local population fled. The Vikings looted the city in a single day but didn't stay overnight, retreating to their ships because they thought it might be a trap and that the main forces of the emir were coming. However, the emir had only just begun assembling his troops. Two days later, the Vikings returned, plundered what was left, loaded their ships with riches, and offered the local population a deal: anyone who returned to the city would be spared, and the captives would be exchanged for gold. This was a clever ruse by the Vikings. They were treacherous people, hoping that most of the population would return, giving them another opportunity to plunder. 3 days later,the Vikings returned. This time, only a small group of Muslims had returned -- mostly elderly people. When the Vikings approached, they sought refuge in the mosque. The Vikings burned the mosque and slaughtered those hiding inside. From that time on, the mosque was known as the &quot;Mosque of the Martyrs.&quot; Finally, the emir of Cordoba gathered his army and caught up with the Vikings near Seville. The Vikings boarded their ships and sailed upriver. At some point, they disembarked, and that's when the Arabs, or Moors, used one of their favorite tactics: a feigned retreat. They lured the Vikings into chasing them. The battle took place near what is now the Seville airport, and in a horrific slaughter, the emir's forces defeated the Vikings. According to some reports, they killed 1,000 Vikings and captured 400; others claim 500 were killed and 100 captured. Either way, the numbers were terrifying for that time. Some of the Vikings managed to retreat, get back to their ships, and escape downriver to the ocean. The prisoners were immediately executed, and their heads were hung on palm trees as a warning. Now, here's the main question: before me is a fortress -- it's on a different coast, not Galicia, but Catalonia, in Tossa de Mar. This is what a typical coastal fortification looked like. How could the Vikings capture it? Well, let's consider the first thing that distinguished the Vikings. The drakkar was an efficient ship with a very low draft, yet it was large enough. These ships came in various sizes, but the largest could hold up to 180 warriors. The low draft allowed the ship to blend with the horizon. They always seemed to emerge from the mist, striking without warning. What enabled this surprise? The Vikings had excellent reconnaissance. First, small boats would arrive, disembarking men disguised as traders. These men would integrate with the local population, noting the dates of religious festivals, market days, or that unrest might distract the populace. If the local population was preoccupied with unrest, it would be the perfect time to strike. Quietly, under the cover of fog, the Vikings would row in and immediately storm the fortress. They used ballistae and other siege weapons to hurl stones, and grappling hooks to tear apart the fortress walls. There's even a common belief that Vikings used axes to scale walls. Wooden gates would be hacked apart with axes, while others used shields to protect the attackers. Under the cover, men would charge the gates, drive axes into the structure, and then use the embedded axes to climb up onto the towers. Now, I've seen this in movies -- you've probably seen it too -- but there are historical accounts, for instance during the siege of Paris, that such tactics were actually used. The Vikings captured fortresses with lightning speed. What set them apart was their flawless discipline: commanders issued clear orders, and the Viking warriors executed them perfectly. It was a highly disciplined army, skilled in both land and sea combat. After the first devastating Viking raids, the Moors began building their own fleet, gaining an advantage with &quot;Greek fire.&quot; They used substances similar to naptha, like primitive flamethrowers, to set Viking ships ablaze. However, when it came to boarding actions and close combat, the Vikings still emerged victorious. Even so, the emir of Cordoba, after seeing his coastline ravaged and burned by Viking raids all the way to Andalusia, built a fleet of up to 300 ships and hired disciplined sailors. As for Tossa de Mar, there's a local story that some residents have told me. Apparently, a Viking strayed from his group and landed here, settling down with his family. I couldn't find any historical evidence to support the local story. Most likely, it refers to the 859 expedition led by Bjorn Ironside. After burning Galicia, the Vikings reached Andalusia, where they clashed with the emir's fleet and were unable to land, so they sailed through the Strait of Gibraltar to Africa. For 20 days, they plundered and burned Morocco. Afterward, they returned to Europe, and the Viking fleet split into two groups -- not here in Tossa de Mar, but farther beyond Barcelona, near Tortosa. After splitting, one group, led by Bjorn Ironside, went on to raid Provence. They burned Nimes and Montpellier, and the Vikings even reached Italy, where they looted Pisa. The second group sailed upriver into Pamplona -- note that Pamplona is in northern Spain, not Italy -- where they captured the King of Navarre. The Vikings received a ransom of several thousand gold coins for him and returned home. The last recorded Viking raid on Spain occurred in 968. Once again, they landed in Galicia, and, encountering no resistance, they looted Santiago de Compostela and all the coastal monasteries. They burned everything and dug in, remaining there for two years until the Count of Galicia finally arrived with his forces to drive them out. These terrible raids left such a profound impact that Vikings were used to scare children, often being described as spawns of Satan due to their pagan beliefs. They slaughtered people in their homes, in churches, and during Catholic holidays -- it made no difference to them. According to one version, the horned Viking helmets were invented by monks, who portrayed them as Satan's children arriving in horned helmets. No horned helmets have ever been found in Viking burial sites. Perhaps they were used for rituals, but they were not worn in battle. The horned Viking helmets you see among Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish football fans are a myth. Vikings never wore such helmets in combat because they were impractical. This is just a historical legend. One version of the myth traces its origins to the Middle Ages, when monks depicted the Vikings as horned devil worshippers. Another version comes from the poetry and literature of the 19th century, where the image of the Viking was embellished. However, fortresses like the one we're looking at could be taken by the Vikings in about three hours, expending hardly any energy. Well, of course, that's an exaggeration -- they expended a lot of energy. These fierce, bearded men -- who were often thought to be giant warriors but were actually of average height, around 1.50 to 1.60 meters, more like Tolkien's dwarves -- and these bearded Tolkien's dwarves would scale the walls with their axes, massacre the population, load their loot onto their drakkars, and sail away. As a result, Europe began praying, &quot;Deliver us from the Northmen,&quot; because nothing could stop them. At this time, the Frankish Empire had collapsed into internal strife, and the Vikings took full advantage of this. Then the most exciting part began: Initially, the Viking raids were seasonal: they would pillage, sail back home for the winter, spend the wealth they had looted, listen to skalds, and live well until the next summer. Come June, they'd set sail again. But at some point, the Vikings realized: "Why go home? These people can't defend themselves, a useless bunch. Let's just stay and winter here. We can live in their homes." It all starts in Ireland, then continues in England, and eventually, the Vikings settle at the mouth of the Seine, living in what is now modern-day France. No one offered any real resistance. Only the Arabs fought back. After the Vikings first took Lisbon, they sailed further south, traveled upriver, and reached Seville. It was only there that the Moors offered significant resistance and defeated them. They executed 300 Vikings, beheading them and sending some of the heads back to North Africa as a warning, saying, &quot;Look at these strange bearded warriors we fought.&quot; The rest of the heads were thrown into the Viking boats. No one, except for the Arabs, could resist them because the Arabs had more discipline and well-structured armies. As the Vikings began spreading across Europe, they stopped returning home for the winter. Initially, people thought, "Oh, it's summer; the Vikings will come, but in winter, we can live in peace because no one will come then." But winter peace was no longer an option for Europe. The Vikings pillaged year-round, living along the rivers and moving up them to steal, only to come back again. And no punitive expedition could be organized. A Viking ship was faster than a horse, so if a military force gathered somewhere, the Vikings would simply jump back into their drakkars and sail away, vanishing completely. It was impossible to catch them. Now, the question that has puzzled me -- and I'm sure it has puzzled you as well -- is: How did they manage to sail these ships to the shores of Iceland or even North America? After all, we know the Vikings discovered America -- Vinland. How did they get there? What kind of navigation was possible in the face of massive waves, northern seas, fog, icebergs, and early coastal ice in some areas? There are a few theories. The first is that Vikings, when embarking on their sea voyages, navigated by following the coastal outlines of land. That's great when you're sailing near something like modern-day Dunkirk, in the English Channel, where you can see land on both sides -- France on one side, England on the other. You can easily find the way. But that doesn't help in the Atlantic, which is vast and seemingly endless. Stars and the sun are unreliable, especially in foggy conditions, and navigating by them becomes difficult. Then there's the legend that, according to modern scholars, is not just a myth. It's about the so-called "sunstone" or Iceland spar, a transparent mineral. The Vikings allegedly placed this stone into a ceramic circle, and by observing how sunlight refracted through it, they could somehow calculate their course. However, this is just speculation. I tend to think that the true key to Viking navigation was in their seasoned sailors. These skilled navigators passed down their knowledge to the new generation: &quot;So, let's head from Denmark to England, and we'll take Ingvar with us. He's an experienced guy; he's led us there 10 times before, so he knows the way.&quot; I imagine it went something like that. Of course, they also relied on birds -- every Viking ship had ravens onboard. If they got lost, they would release a raven, and if the bird didn't return, it meant land was near. And if it didn't? Well, that's not very reliable either, but it was all part of their intuition. They knew roughly where they were going based on past voyages. Still, it's remarkable how far these drakkars traveled, instilling fear across Europe, instilling absolute terror, as they essentially redrew the map of the continent, which we'll uncover more of later. In 845, we reach a pivotal moment, marking the height of Viking terror. This was the beginning of a few centuries of unchecked Viking raids that terrorized Europe. That year, an army under the command of Ragnar Lothbrok (Leather Pants) captured and burned Paris. Ragnar, a semi-legendary Viking king, was one of the most famous Viking leaders. Let's stick to the terminology: Why the nickname &quot;Leather Pants&quot;? According to legend, when he was a child, he somehow ended up in a pit of snakes. However, his mother had made him pants from leather -- either bull or other animal hide -- so the snakes couldn't bite through them, as they only tried biting his legs. As a result, he survived, and this remarkable man went on to sack and burn Paris, receiving 7,000 silver coins from the king of France as a tribute afterward. This was an astronomical sum of money. After that, the Vikings were in a euphoric state, thinking, "Wait, they're paying us not to kill them?" Europe began paying tribute to the Vikings. They would sail up or down the Seine, or approach other coastal cities, and people would start offering them tribute: &quot;Please don't pillage us, here's some money.&quot; It was humiliating, but it meant the Vikings didn't even need to bother with raids and fighting. By 845, the legend of the Great Viking Army began to form, or the Great Heathen Army, as medieval chroniclers would later call it. After pillaging Paris, Ragnar sailed down the Seine toward what is now Normandy. He looted there as well, and as more bandits joined him, he decided that perhaps they'd reached the limit of how much they could rob France. "How much more can we take? We've been plundering here for years," they thought. So they sailed off to pillage England instead. This is where the origins of the Great Heathen Army lie. Ragnar, with his small or moderately sized band, arrived in England and landed in Northumbria in 865. There, King Aella II encountered the Viking ships, which had run aground, and managed to capture them. According to legend, he condemned Ragnar to a torturous death. When Ragnar declared who he was -- Ragnar Lothbrok, &quot;Leather Pants&quot; -- or perhaps it was his men who said it, Aella is said to have scoffed, "Oh, is this the legendary snake-proof fellow? Well, let's test the myth." They threw him into a pit of venomous snakes, which bit Ragnar to death, condemning him to a slow and painful demise. Now for his sons. One of them was Ivar the Boneless -- a remarkable nickname in itself. Some speculate that he may have suffered from a condition like osteogenesis imperfecta, a hereditary mutation of bone tissues. The other son was Halfdan. Together, they assembled the Great Heathen Army, a massive force with 200-300 ships, and with all their might, they descended upon England. They captured York In 867, and over the next few decades, they seized control of much of England. The English referred to them as &quot;Danes&quot; -- they didn't distinguish between Swedes, Norwegians, or other groups; to them, they were all Danes. The Danes took over and ruled more than half of England for centuries. But the Heathen Army, the Great Heathen Army, or the Great Viking Army, didn't stop there. After plundering England, they returned to France in 885. In 885, a huge army led by Siegfried and Rollo -- known as Rollo the Walker, because he was reportedly so hige that no horse could carry him -- this huge army besieged Paris in 885. They approached the city swiftly, as the Count of Paris was still gathering cavalry and infantry from various regions. The forces arrived in parts, and Rollo's men defeated each contingent as they came. Following Viking tradition, the dead were hung from trees as sacrifices to Odin. After all, they were devout people who couldn't just let such victories pass without making human sacrifices to honor their gods. They couldn't take Paris, however, because a plague broke out, affecting both the besieging Vikings and the city's defenders. In the end, the Vikings were bought off once again, and they sailed down the Seine. This marks the point where the Vikings started to not just winter in the territories they conquered but to truly settle there. The King of France made a treaty with Rollo called the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte -- quite a tongue-twister! What was significant about this treaty? It ceded the region of Normandy to the Vikings. They pledge fealty to the king of France, but there's a funny story associated with that event. The custom was to kiss the king's feet, but Rollo -- who, as we know, was so large that even a horse couldn't carry him -- refused. He didn't intend to bow down to some ruler of half-a-kingdom. Rollo said, &quot;I'm not kissing anyone's feet; that's beneath me. I have principles. I'll have one of my men do it for me.&quot; And when his man went to pay homage, either he stumbled or purposely grabbed the king's foot, causing the king to fall. It was humiliating, but there was nothing yhe king could do since he couldn't fight with the Vikings. So, they got Normandy. At this point, the Vikings began to truly take root in the land. European chaos continued, of course. In 968, Galicia was sacked and burned, and the bishop of Santiago de Compostela was killed. In 980, raids on England resumed, and by 986, the Vikings reached Vinland, the shores of North America, where they attempted to colonize, though unsuccessfully. This marks the start of a new chapter: the Vikings began settling down. What does this mean? After Rollo the Walker was given Normandy. While later this would become the Duchy of Normandy, according to chronicles, Rollo was never actually called a duke -- he was known as princeps. Still, he became a land-owning continental nobleman. What does it mean for him? He was living on the continent now, in Normandy, and the very same Vikings could come and raid his lands. Castles started popping up all over Normandy -- at river mouths, bays, and anywhere a fleet could dock -- to control the land and keep it safe. His agreement with the French king was simple: Rollo would protect the kingdom from future Viking raids. Of course, the reality was that &quot;protecting&quot; meant little -- but this gave Rollo a strategic advantage. When the king asked him to send troops, Rollo could respond, &quot;I can't send men right now; I need them here to protect you from the Vikings. And as for wine or grain, well, I can't spare any of that either, I have to feed my warriors.&quot; In this way, Rollo's focus shifted to protecting his own lands. The king, far off in his court, mattered little, Rollo was the true authority on the ground. Eventually, Rollo's old Viking comrades showed up to see him. &quot;So, how's it going here? I heard they made you some sort of duke or something?&quot; they asked. Rollo replied, &quot;No, not exactly a duke, but yes, I'm nobility now.&quot; He sat there, his beard neatly trimmed, fingernails cut with a knife. They say to him, &quot;So, are you coming with us to burn Paris or Rouen?&quot; And he replies, &quot;Nah, guys, I can't anymore. I'm one of them now.&quot; &quot;What do you mean, you're one of them?&quot; they ask. &quot;Well, I'm not exactly one of them, but I can't join you -- it wouldn't be right.&quot; They ask, &quot;But will you at least let us go and pillage Paris?&quot; &quot;Oh sure, no problem, we're still family after all.&quot; Obviously, it's still an economy of influence, power, and status. The Vikings return home and tell their people, &quot;Hey, you know Rollo? He used to be one of us, and now he's some duke or something! Those fools from Paris come bringing him scrolls from the king. He's really made it big, wow!&quot; And that's how the Vikings began trying to build their own form of statehood. What's interesting is that by the second generation... Rollo's wife was named Poppa, by the way -- yes, you might find it amusing, but that was really her name. Whether it's spelled with one &quot;p&quot; or two doesn't really matter. They had two children, one of whom was named William. What's notable about that name? It's a Frankish name. No more Harald, or Sven the Ear, or Barbos the Three-Toothed. It's a proper European name. They were assimilating, and along with that, Christianity was gradually entering their lives. For a long time, the Vikings would worship two gods: Jesus Christ on one side, and Odin on the other. Just in case, they'd still sacrifice 25 bodies to Odin so he wouldn't feel left out -- it was more convenient that way. How did Christianity come to them? It was also a matter of status. I can imagine Rollo sitting with a bishop one day and asking, &quot;Tell me, Bishop, why are you a bishop?&quot; The bishop replies, &quot;Well, I'm a mediator between God and the common people. Of course, the Pope is the main mediator, but I guide my flock here.&quot; &quot;And they listen to you?&quot; Rollo asks. &quot;Of course they do,&quot; the bishop says. &quot;Hold on, so there's the king and then there's you. What's the difference between you two?&quot; The bishop explains, &quot;Ah, well, royal power comes from God. The king is crowned by the Pope, and everything is sanctioned by the church.&quot; Rollo realizes that the church plays a critical role. As a matter of fact, it legitimizes power. That same king, the one my bodyguard pulled by the leg, is legitimized by the church. So Rollo concludes, &quot;I need to be part of this system, otherwise I'm not truly legitimate.&quot; That's when the construction of churches begins, and the process of Christianization kicks off. Again, it's all about status. Yesterday, you were the head of a gang, with 25 similar gangs under you if you were a chieftain. Today, you're part of the European elite. That's how they founded the Duchy of Normandy. The Vikings also established the Kingdom of Sicily down in the south. The Normans eventually became part of the aristocratic and noble processes that were shaping Europe. But we should also mention the lands of the Slavs because there's a well-established theory about the Norman origins of political power in Kievan Rus'. The Vikings didn't just colonize Europe; they also raided and colonized the coasts of the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and even the Caspian Sea. They captured Slavs, sold them into slavery, and transported them to places like Khazaria or Volga Bulgaria, selling them at steep prices and making a hefty profit. This is how the &quot;Varangian to Greek&quot; trade route was established -- it went from the Varangians to the Greeks. The Vikings traded all sorts of goods: silk, weapons, and people. The trade route passed through Novgorod and followed the rivers that flowed through Slavic lands. One of the key advantages of Viking ships was their versatility. They were equally capable in both deep seas and shallow rivers, navigating effortlessly in both environments. Legend goes, the Vikings (or Varangians) captured and burned Novgorod, seizing the surrounding lands. At some point, however, the Novgorodians rallied and expelled the occupiers. But realizing that such invasions couldn't continue, in 862, they invited Rurik to rule over them. Rurik is the origin of the name Rurikovich, the dynasty that ruled Russia until the rise of the Romanovs. Who was Rurik? The name Rurik is a variation of &quot;Rorik,&quot; a common Scandinavian or Norman name. So, essentially, a Viking settled in Novgorod -- nothing strange about that. He was no different from Rollo the Walker, who settled in Normandy, no different from some Viking who settled in Sicily. This gradual settlement of Vikings across Europe also marked the beginning of the end of the Viking era. The myth of their invincibility began to fade as European states, from England to France, started forming regular armies. Vikings were excellent at hit-and-run tactics: they would land from their ships, kill, raid, and then quickly sail away. While they fought well on foot, they weren't as adept at mounted combat, and regular armies eventually defeated them on open battlefields. Kings began fortifying river mouths and bays, Monasteries and cities moved further inland, mainly monasteries moved further inland, to prevent easy access from rivers, making it more difficult for Viking ships to sack them. The next important development for the Vikings was the introduction of Christianity along with the titles that European kings began to grant them. This had a profound impact on the Vikings, gradually bringing an end to their nomadic, raiding lifestyle. Instead, the Vikings became active participants in European political life. Of course, they still fought, with internal conflicts arising as they battled each other for the Norwegian throne. This period, around the 11th century, marks the beginning of the formation of the Danish and Norwegian kingdoms. If you talk to Danes today, they'll often tell you over a drink that Norway used to be their territory. They'll say, &quot;Who are the Norwegians? It used to be our territory. We cut their jarls down like cabbages, easy as pie, and they swore allegiance to us all the time. Today, sure, they've got oil, and they're independent, but we Danes were always the main players -- there were no other real Vikings but us.&quot; The Norwegians would claim the opposite, naturally. So, states were starting to take shape. And then there are the Swedes, who would also claim they were the most important Vikings. But nevertheless, this period saw the emergence of statehood in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. This was the dawn of the era of kingdoms, when these former Viking bands were gradually transforming into monarchies, and most importantly, into economic powers. We began with the idea that trade was better than agriculture because it brought in more money. Slave trade was even more lucrative, it brought even more money than regular trade, and seizing other people's property was the most profitable of all. However, once economic relationships changed, and raiding no longer yielded substantial profits, the Vikings abandoned their old ways. If you were the Duke of Normandy instead of a gang leader, you now had land, peasants, and steady income that came without the need for constant warfare. It was far more profitable and safer. This shift played a significant role in the decline of the Viking era. Many Vikings became mercenaries, joining personal guards in places like Constantinople. Some even served in Arab armies, yes, Arab armies had Viking detachments, but these were isolated occurrences, signaling the fragmentation of the Viking world. Its final chapter is often said to be the year 1066, when Harald Hardrada invaded England. He invaded England, and he was defeated, his army was defeated. However, later that same year, Duke William of Normandy -- William the Conqueror, a descendant of Rollo the Walker and his wife Poppa -- landed in England, captured it, and established Norman rule over England for centuries. Thus, the journey of the Vikings went from small bands sailing rickety boats and burning monasteries to William the Conqueror. This was the Vikings' way. What legacy did the Vikings leave behind? First, they left us with fascinating stories, the kind that inspire entire TV series -- that's already a lot. Then, they left us sagas and poems. In fact, I'd like to tell you a few quotes, as I promised, quotes from the Elder Edda. I'll share them with you now. Elder Edda, forgive me, but some of them align surprisingly well with modern &quot;street codes&quot; of honor -- all those codes are based on real life, a kind of &quot;wolf law&quot; that rules the streets as it ruled the Vinkings' lives back then. Let's take a look at the Elder Edda: &quot;He who cannot hold his tongue often speaks foolishly. A quick tongue will bring trouble if not restrained.&quot; What does that mean? Watch your words, right? Another quote: &quot;The mocker rejoices when he offends a guest and escapes. Such a man doesn't realize he's earned angry enemies.&quot; In other words, if you offend someone and think you'll get away with it, rest assured, the opposing crew will catch up with you and make you pay. &quot;Men are often friends, but sometimes they fight at a feast. Quarrels arise easily, guest against guest.&quot; This is also easy to understand -- when you're at a feast, you have to watch yourself and what you say. Here's another one: &quot;Though your house may be small, it's yours, and you are its master. But the heart bleeds for those forced to beg.&quot; This is practically the same as &quot;Don't trust, don't fear, don't ask.&quot; Another: &quot;A man should never be far from his weapon, for you never know when a spear might be useful.&quot; This is a total street code -- always carry a weapon because you never know if you'll head out to eat and end up in a fight. That's the Elder Edda for you. Of course, if we look at it more literarily, we could find parallels with The Song of Solomon or even draw some Buddhist or Christian comparisons. But at its core, it feels more like a code of honor or set of principles that the Vikings lived by. Skaldic poetry and runes are also part of their legacy. You can see their influence in modern design, especially in Scandinavian minimalism -- those clean, concrete forms echo ancient burial mounds, which came from the Viking era. Even skiing --The word &quot;ski&quot; comes from the Old Norse &quot;skio,&quot; meaning wooden planks. Vikings used skis to travel across the snow -- sometimes for fun, sometimes out of necessity. It's hard to walk through deep snow, but much easier to glide over it on skis. As for seafaring, the Vikings taught Europe how to navigate the seas. The Moors built their fleet in response to the Viking threat, and the English eventually created their own fleet as well. The Norman ships that brought William the Conqueror to the English throne in 1066 were the foundation of England's later naval dominance. So, the foundation was laid by the Vikings' conquest. The Vikings redrew the map of Europe. I've already mentioned Normandy, Sicily, and Rus'. These were lands ruled by people who, in one way or another, held significant influence over the political landscape of Europe. The Norman Conquest of England led to the introduction of feudalism, and its roots can be traced back to the very treaty that the French king signed with Rollo the Walker. The economic traditions of England, Ireland, and Scotland were also shaped by the Vikings -- many Irish cities were founded by them. In fact, the first kingdom in Ireland was established by the Vikings. So, on the one hand, they were ruthless raiders -- gangsters, if you will -- but on the other hand, they had a profound influence on European history. And now, as promised, here's the story of how Bluetooth is connected to the Vikings. If you look at the Bluetooth logo, it's made up of two runes representing the initials of Harald &quot;Bluetooth&quot;, the king of Denmark. he had a defect -- blue, or more likely, black, blackened teeth. The word &quot;blau&quot; in the Viking language didn't quite mean &quot;blue&quot; as we understand it today; it likely referred to something much darker, closer to black. So, Harald Bluetooth -- he's the man who brought Christianity to Denmark. Thanks to him, Christianity spread in the country, though, in a twist of fate, he was later killed in a civil war by his own son. Still, Harald left his mark on history. Now, let's see what Wikipedia has to say about why Bluetooth technology was named after Harald Bluetooth. It says, &quot;He ruled Denmark and part of Norway and united the warring Danish tribes into a single kingdom. The idea is that Bluetooth does the same with communication protocols, uniting them into a single universal standard.&quot; Honestly, I didn't know this until I was preparing for this video. Now I know, and now you know, too. That's just one aspect of the Viking Age. I could go on for a long time about Viking mythology or delve deeper into their raids, but in this hour or so, I've tried to share with you a topic that I know well and truly love. Thank you all very much for watching.
