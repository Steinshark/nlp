After the heavy rain, I found a puppy lying on the roadside steps, crying continuously. So I stopped the car to help him. He was very scared when he saw people and kept backing away. The rain was heavy on the mountain, and the puppy was shivering constantly after getting soaked. Few people pass by on this road, so I was worried about his safety and decided to take him home. I wrapped him in my clothes, and he kept trembling in my arms. I thought he probably couldn't find any food on the rainy mountain and must have been hungry for a long time. So I took him to the supermarket to get him something to fill his stomach. The supermarket owner was very kind and even found me a bag. With that, I safely brought him home, and he was very curious about his new surroundings. I grabbed some tissues to help dry him off, but found the tissues weren't very effective. So I got my towel to dry him off, and from then on, this little guy would have a home. He gradually got used to the place and even peed in the house. After he finished peeing, he started gnawing on the towel. I thought he must be very hungry by now. So I went to get him some food, but the sound of the door closing startled him, and he quickly hid. As soon as I opened the package, he rushed up to me and started eating eagerly. I don't know when this little guy last had a meal. I had to go out for a while, so I left him at home. When I was leaving, he kept quietly watching me. After finishing my errands, I rushed back to check on the puppy. When I got home, I found he had eaten most of the food I'd left for him. However, I couldn't see him anywhere. After searching around, I found he had gone into another room. When he saw me approaching, he kept backing away as if he wanted to hide, but stopped once he recognized my scent. Meeting him felt like fate. This yard would be his home from now on, and he would never have to worry about getting wet in the rain again. After being soaked by the rain, this puppy was both dirty and smelly. So I prepared a basin of warm water to bathe him. He took a sip from it, maybe thinking I'd prepared it for him to drink. He wasn't afraid of the water at all and behaved very well during the bath. Since I didn't have a hairdryer at home, I dried him off with a towel and took him to a neighbor's to borrow one. When he first heard the sound of the hairdryer, he was a little scared and kept backing away. Gradually, he got used to it, and after his bath, he looked completely refreshed. Once we got home, I found a box to serve as his temporary bed. I realized the box was too deep, so I ended up using the basin I had bathed him in. It had been raining constantly, and the temperature was low, so I laid a thicker blanket for him. Shortly after settling in, the little guy was already asleep. On the fifth day, it finally stopped raining. Today, I planned to take him to the pet store to buy some food suitable for him. Not long into the trip, he was already fast asleep. Half an hour later, we arrived at the pet store. The little guy still looked half-asleep. The store owner told me that he was about a month old and could start eating dog food. So I decided to buy him some dog food he would enjoy from the store. The store owner was very nice and allowed the puppy to sample some food to find one he liked. The little guy was still drowsy and didn't react when I placed the dog food in front of him. I put him on the ground to wake him up, but he seemed frightened by the new environment and wasn't willing to eat. He even hid under a small stool but eventually came out to explore once he got a bit more comfortable with the store. The owner let him try another type of dog food and opened a small packet for him. It seemed like the little guy was quite pleased with this one. The store owner said this dog food was even edible for humans, so I took a little taste myself. After eating his fill, the little guy tried to make friends with the other dogs in the pet store. Unexpectedly, one of the store dogs didn't like him approaching and scratched the corner of his mouth. The puppy was frightened and trembling, and the store owner stood up for him. She scolded the other dog harshly, though he still looked unconvinced. I held the puppy in my arms to comfort him. He was still shaking and hadn't fully calmed down, trembling in my hands. The store owner opened a tasty can for him, but he didn't eat it. It seems he was really scared. He found a corner to hide in, and all his sadness was written on his face. Since it's my first time raising a puppy, I could only hold him to comfort him in situations like this. I bought some dog food he likes from the store, and the owner, feeling a bit guilty, gave us plenty of extra food. Since the puppy is still young, I felt uneasy after leaving the pet store and decided to take him to a nearby animal hospital for a check-up. At the hospital, the vet examined him and told me that such a small wound was no big deal. After applying some iodine, I took the puppy home. After applying medicine on him at home, I opened a can of food as a treat to make up for it. It seems he's feeling better now, as he's eating the food in big bites. On the seventh day, after a few applications of iodine, his wound was fully healed. Since I brought the puppy home, I hadn't had a chance to go back up the mountain. Now that his wound has healed, I decided to take him up the mountain to meet my family today. He was quietly resting in my clothes along the way, and soon, we arrived at our destination. From the first moment she saw the puppy, my sister-in-law couldn't stop smiling. Everyone liked the little guy and even wanted to cook an egg for him. I took him under a tree to cool off, and he sat quietly, behaving very well. Soon, the egg they were cooking was ready, and before it was even peeled, he had already smelled it and leaned over the basket. After peeling the egg and placing it by his mouth, he happily ate it. My older brother was also very pleased when he saw the puppy. The three of us sat under the tree, chatting and discussing what we should name the puppy. Each of us had our own ideas, so we decided we needed more time to think about a name for him. We chatted happily for a long time, but in the end, we still didn't settle on a name. On the eighth day, I decided to let the puppy choose his own name. I wrote down all the names that my family and friends had thought of. The puppy stretched lazily behind me, lying comfortably on the table, almost falling asleep. I arranged the written names in a circle and placed some of his favorite food on each one. By the time I was done, the puppy had already fallen asleep. Not wanting to wake him, I decided to wait until he woke up to let him choose, keeping myself busy in the meantime. Two hours later, the puppy finally woke up, and right away, he started looking for food. I placed him in the center of the names to see which one he would pick. He still looked a bit sleepy, glancing around at the names. After a moment of hesitation, the little guy chose "Xiaosui," so from now on, he has a new name. To celebrate his new name, I bought him a new toy - a little duck. On the ninth day, I decided to take Xiaosui to the hospital for a checkup. I thought he seemed healthy a few days ago, so I didn't take him right away. Today, I finally had time and decided to take him in. On the way, I noticed a small landslide on the roadside slope. Xiaosui seemed uneasy in the car and kept barking. I kept petting him to give him a sense of security. Half an hour later, we arrived at the hospital, where the doctor started a basic checkup. Even the doctor praised Xiaosui for being well-behaved and cute. Xiaosui was in good health. I considered deworming him, but the doctor suggested waiting ten days to let him adapt first. Since Xiaosui was a stray, we weren't sure if he had any contagious diseases, and we wanted to avoid stressing him. The doctor noticed that Xiaosui loves to chew and explained that he's currently in his teething phase. So I bought him a chew stick at the hospital. When I went to pay, the doctor said it was free and gave it to us as a gift. After thanking the doctor, we left the hospital, and unexpectedly, we ran into an acquaintance on the way home. After chatting, I took Xiaosui to the toy store to buy a toy. We finally picked a ball, and Xiaosui seemed to love it. Once we got home, we couldn't wait to start playing with his new toy. Having spent these days by my side, Xiaosui must be very happy. I hope he can grow up healthy. On the tenth day, I prepared a delicious meal for Xiaosui, and he eagerly started eating. On the eleventh day, it rained, and I needed to help my elder brother with some work up the mountain, which made it inconvenient to bring Xiaosui along. For Xiaosui's safety, I left him in my room and prepared enough food for the day. When I left, Xiaosui seemed reluctant to part and walked me all the way to the door. After returning home, I found that Xiaosui had made a mess of the room. When I looked at him, he pretended to be innocent. Then I took him to the yard. Xiaosui seemed to know he'd done something wrong. I called him back to the living room, and he obediently went inside, lying down as if he were reflecting on his actions. After tidying up the room a bit, I went to the living room to find Xiaosui. Xiaosui doesn't hold a grudge. As soon as I called him, he ran to me. Xiaosui is so cute that I couldn't stay mad at him, so I opened a chicken breast treat for him. That night, I let him sleep on my bed. The next morning, I woke up to find that this little guy had wet the bed. On the twelfth day, I finally had time and planned to take Xiaosui to the hospital for his vaccination. At the hospital, the vet still remembered Xiaosui and, after confirming he was ready, registered him for his vaccine. The vet said Xiaosui looks a bit like a golden retriever. We took him to weigh in, and he'd gained about six ounces. Then the vet performed other checks, and Xiaosui obediently lay on the table, allowing the vet to examine him. Xiaosui was very healthy, so the vet started preparing the vaccine. He seemed to sense he was about to get a shot and started whining. The vet gave the injection while I calmed him. Now, Xiaosui officially has a record, and we'll need to return to the hospital for follow-up shots. The vet also advised me to stop feeding Xiaosui too much food - just the right amount is enough. After giving us some advice, the vet administered a topical dewormer and told me that Xiaosui shouldn't bathe for seven days after that. Once I had all the information, I took Xiaosui to a pet store to buy him some clothes. After shopping, we went to the park to play. We met a woman who kept playing with Xiaosui. At first, he was a little shy, but soon he was happily chasing after her. Xiaosui had a lot of fun at the park, and I decided I should bring him outside more often. On the fourteenth day, I took Xiaosui with me to pick honeysuckle to make tea. Halfway there, I let Xiaosui walk on his own. During our free time, I taught Xiaosui some simple commands. However, his idea of shaking hands is more like biting my hand. He really is an adorable little dog. As I went to pick honeysuckle, he happily trotted along behind me. While I picked flowers, Xiaosui stayed by my side, keeping me company. After we were done, Xiaosui, with his short legs, couldn't keep up with my pace, but when he saw I was waiting for him, he ran up to me. While I was weaving a flower crown for him, he was so tired he nearly fell asleep. When it was done, he was still napping. Then I pretended to walk away, and Xiaosui immediately perked up and followed me. I needed to pick a lot of honeysuckle, so Xiaosui waited for me in a shaded spot when he got bored. After finishing, I took Xiaosui home to enjoy the fruits of our labor. After dinner in the evening, I took Xiaosui for a walk and made him a cool outfit out of a large coconut shell. On the eighteenth day, I took Xiaosui to the village to help an elderly man fix his phone. Xiaosui has now gotten used to staying by my side every day. Wherever I go, he follows. When we arrived, I found that the elderly man had two dogs as well: one completely black and the other looking as if it wore a helmet. They were both very friendly, but because Xiaosui had been hurt before, he's still very wary of other dogs. At first, Xiaosui was very reluctant around the two dogs, but their friendliness eventually put him at ease. After fixing the phone, I found Xiaosui had fallen asleep at the man's house. Since he is one of the village's elderly residents, we took advantage of Xiaosui's nap to get him a few things from the market. When we returned, Xiaosui had just woken up, and I helped tidy up the man's home a bit. Xiaosui, who was hungry, started eating right there at the man's house. After a brief chat, I took Xiaosui back home, and today, he made two new friends. On the nineteenth day, Xiaosui showed himself to be a very insecure little dog. He gets scared by footsteps and barks at strangers, even being cautious when sensing goodwill. However, in front of me, Xiaosui unconditionally exposes his belly. He can sleep peacefully by my side because he trusts me completely. On the twenty-second day, it has been raining every day, and the house has been leaking. Xiaosui has been keeping me company, listening to the sound of the rain on the roof, and I've been wanting to update Xiaosui's house for a while. However, this yard is too small, so it's hard to make a dedicated little house for him here. After packing everything up, I set off with Xiaosui. I took Xiaosui to a spacious yard. The previous owner of this place doesn't stay here often and wanted someone to bring some life to it, so he rented it out to me. As we walked around the yard, I planned out how each part would be set up. This place has a great location, and the road is easy to access, making travel much more convenient now. Xiaosui was so tired that he almost fell asleep in my arms. When we went into the room where the owner used to keep animals, the smell woke Xiaosui up. The landlord will eventually clear out the living room, and I'll add some new furnishings after that. I saw a little cart, so I put Xiaosui on it to let him try it out while I went to get him some food. When I returned with his food, I found that Xiaosui was missing, only to see he had gotten stuck in a crack between some stones outside. On his first day in the new house, Xiaosui experienced quite the little setback. I brought him to the food, and after being hungry for so long, he started eating eagerly. On the twenty-fourth day, I took Xiaosui to the pet shop for grooming. Shortly after we arrived, a white cat came in, and the staff put Xiaosui and the white cat together. Xiaosui wasn't nearly as bold as the white cat and didn't dare to look at her directly. Before the bath, the vet performed some checks. Since his nails hadn't been trimmed before, he was a little scared of the clipping process. In the hands of the staff, Xiaosui behaved very well, and they patiently bathed him until he was spotless. I stood by to help keep Xiaosui calm. After his bath, Xiaosui looked much cleaner, and he even made some new friends here. However, he's still a bit timid. A little Bichon Frise wanted to play with him, but he kept backing away in fear. The staff gave Xiaosui a small treat, and the Bichon waited nearby, hoping to play with him afterward. Xiaosui was frightened by the Bichon's enthusiasm, and whenever the Bichon barked, Xiaosui retreated. Only after the Bichon turned away to play on his own did Xiaosui dare to come out and eat his treat. It seems every animal pretends to be busy when they feel awkward. He refused to let go of the toy ball I used to tease him and left carrying it. Some other small animals watched Xiaosui and his new friends from inside the dryer. Before leaving, I took a photo of Xiaosui with his new friends. When I went to pay, the staff mentioned that we must have a lot of love to raise a stray dog so well. After expressing our thanks, we went home. On the twenty-sixth day, since the first time I took Xiaosui out ended badly, he became particularly shy. To help him develop a more cheerful personality, I brought him to a pet community center today to help him make some friends. Xiaosui was so frightened by the new friend that he kept backing away. After a bit, the two of them started to get a little more comfortable. However, Xiaosui's shyness led him to find a corner to hide in. Then he discovered some cat food, and after glancing around to ensure no one was watching, he dove in for a bite. I noticed Xiaosui seemed interested in cats, so I took him to an area with many cats. Inside, Xiaosui was very nervous and darted around constantly. After running out, he found a white dog and approached him on his own. Before long, the two of them became familiar with each other and began chasing and playing together. They got so carried away that Xiaosui even bumped his head on a glass door. Tired, they lay down on the floor to sleep. After they woke up, a child fed Xiaosui, and they became friends as well. Once he was full, I encouraged Xiaosui to try jumping down some steps as practice. With my guidance, he eventually braved the tallest step. The white dog seemed to sense we were leaving and kept watching us. Xiaosui looked reluctant to part as well. While all meetings must end, I believe they will meet again someday. On the thirty-fifth day, we started renovating the yard I rented a few days ago. Today, I brought Xiaosui along as I tidied up the living room. After cleaning up, Xiaosui could freely run around the living room. Xiaosui stayed by my side, cheering me on. Since this room hadn't been used in a long time, cleaning it took a lot of effort. I was tidying up on my own, and my niece helped look after Xiaosui by my side. Xiaosui was very well-behaved. During a break, I made a little headgear for Xiaosui from a chip bag. He looked quite adorable with it on his head. After clearing out all the trash from the living room, I went to get some water to mop the floor, and a thirsty Xiaosui eagerly drank from the basin. It took some time, but we finally got the living room cleaned up. Then we took Xiaosui to the hospital for his second vaccination. Xiaosui has gained quite a bit of weight, and you can visibly tell he's grown. In front of the vet, Xiaosui was very lively. I wonder if our recent outings helped boost his confidence. It was as if Xiaosui knew he was about to get a shot; he quietly nestled in my arms. We kept praising him, and he seemed to bask in the compliments as he got through the vaccination smoothly. After the shot, the hospital even gave Xiaosui some treats as a reward. A cute little dog came into the hospital, and Xiaosui kept staring at him. When everyone started playing with the new dog, Xiaosui looked a bit sad, leaning against me. He's truly very insecure. On the way home, Xiaosui rested his head on his little duck toy and quickly fell asleep. On the thirty-seventh day, Xiaosui enjoyed playing in the yard. However, since no one had lived there for a while, I was worried there might be bugs. To give Xiaosui a comfortable environment, I decided to pull all the weeds in the yard today. Xiaosui relaxed in a shaded spot, watching me work. When he got tired, he'd take a nap, and when he woke up, he had someone to play with him. When he got bored, Xiaosui even helped me pull some weeds and used branches as a teething stick. He explored the yard, getting himself all dirty, with some bugs even climbing onto him. For his safety, I had my niece put him in a carry bag so he wouldn't roam around too much. He sat obediently in the bag, becoming this year's latest fashion accessory. After a long while, as the sun was setting, we finally finished clearing most of the weeds in the yard. Now, Xiaosui could run freely around the yard. On the thirty-eighth day, my wife came to help me set up our new home. She really liked Xiaosui and brought him a lot of supplies. Xiaosui was especially happy in her arms, looking intently at her as if trying to memorize her face. Knowing I like plants, my wife even bought some greenery for me from the market. She accidentally tripped and felt quite guilty, with Xiaosui watching the whole scene from inside. Xiaosui also got a present, and my wife played with him in the freshly cleaned living room. He was so obedient, fetching toys when she threw them. Xiaosui rushed forward as soon as he understood the command. Later, my wife and I worked together to clean the windows and doors. After a simple meal, my wife headed back down the mountain. My niece stayed in the new house, playing drums with Xiaosui, and he had a great time. That stray puppy I found in the rain has grown up now. I've taken him to many places, and he's met a lot of new friends. His personality has also gradually brightened, thanks to our companionship. Now, all we hope for is that Xiaosui grows up strong and healthy. On the fortieth day, I took Xiaosui out to play, and when my niece called him, he ran over and trustingly showed his belly. When we got to the beach, Xiaosui was initially very scared of the waves. After a while, he realized they weren't so scary and started chasing the waves. On the forty-second day, to give Xiaosui a sense of belonging, I decided to build a little house just for him. I chose a spot with plenty of sunlight and a nearby tree. After selecting the location, we began construction, with Xiaosui supervising us nearby as usual. But since I had never built a house before, I called my second uncle to help me. Bit by bit, the frame of the house started to take shape. I grew even more excited to see the finished product, while Xiaosui, playing nearby, ended up with his nose covered in dirt. These past few days, Xiaosui has been by my side while I clean up the house, getting himself dirty each day. Every day, I rinse him off with clean water. Now, my niece can barely hold him with one hand. As I brushed Xiaosui's fur, he fell asleep comfortably, and I continued working on building his house. A few hours later, the basic structure of Xiaosui's house was complete, and he nodded approvingly as he looked at it. Once the cement dries in a few days, I'll be able to decorate Xiaosui's home and make it cozy. Now Xiaosui has a place to call his own, a home that will give him a sense of security, so he'll never have to worry about being a stray again. On the forty-fifth day, Xiaosui seemed unusually down for some reason. He had lost interest in food and wasn't playing with his toys. To cheer him up, I decided to find him a friend. Back when I fixed the old man's phone, he had two puppies who got along well with Xiaosui. Since the old man was planning to let his son take them to the city, I went to his place to bring the puppies home. I wasn't sure if Xiaosui would remember them, but if he did, he would surely be thrilled to see them. The moment Xiaosui saw them, he tilted his head, trying to recall where he had seen them before. Once he remembered, he started scratching at the door, eager to go out. As soon as I opened it, the three of them started playing excitedly. After not seeing them for so long, Xiaosui was overjoyed and very enthusiastic toward them. The two new puppies were still getting used to their new surroundings. Eagerly, Xiaosui shared his toys with them. With their arrival, Xiaosui noticeably became much happier. Dogs can feel lonely too when they're by themselves for too long; he needed friends as well. From now on, these three little ones will grow up healthy and happy together. I prepared a delicious meal for them, and they wagged their tails, devouring it enthusiastically. Xiaosui was very considerate, letting his friends eat first. After they finished, he sat nearby, watching them groom each other. With more puppies at home, it's essential to feed them properly for their health. When they were tired from playing, the three of them fell asleep in the living room. From now on, the three of you will be the guardians of our home. On the forty-seventh day, the village hasn't been too safe recently, and I've been quite busy. For the safety of the three of them, I decided to install surveillance cameras at home. This way, I can check on them even when I'm not home. I hadn't planned on installing cameras, but one night I dreamt that Xiaosui went missing. It scared me, and with the recent safety concerns in the village, I decided to take precautions. After a day of hard work, I finally got the cameras set up just as the sun was setting. Watching the footage, I could see the three little ones getting along harmoniously. A few days later, while checking the footage, I noticed that when I wasn't home, Xiaosui would quietly wait by the door for my return. On the fiftieth day, I realized I hadn't bathed the two new puppies since bringing them home. I was worried they might carry diseases that could affect Xiaosui, so I decided to give the two of them a bath today. The two little ones ran even faster than Xiaosui, hiding so well that we struggled to find them. When we brought them to the bathroom, they looked at us with innocent eyes. It was likely their first bath, and they weren't used to it; they wanted to escape as soon as they felt the water. Gradually, they got used to it and sat still in the water, allowing us to bathe them. We could feel their nervousness, and after washing one's feet, he was hesitant to put them back down. While bathing him, we discovered he had many ticks, which couldn't be washed off. So, we sprayed alcohol on him and carefully combed them out with a fine-toothed comb. Afterward, we had him cleaned up, and his fur looked much shinier. When it was time to bathe the other puppy, his reaction was quite amusing. Like his brother, he stayed completely still in the water, not daring to move. Once they were both clean, they could happily play with Xiaosui again. After a ten-day adjustment period, we'll take them in for their vaccinations. I believe the three of them will find joy every day through each other's company. On the sixty-seventh day, I took Xiaosui to the hospital for his third vaccination. It seemed like Xiaosui knew where we were going, as he didn't want to wear his leash and refused to move even after putting it on. At the hospital, while Xiaosui got his vaccination, I also had the two little ones treated for parasites. Dogs don't share each other's feelings; the two newcomers curiously observed the new environment. Since Xiaosui had been to the hospital a few times for shots, he refused to step inside the door. We comforted Xiaosui while guiding him to the examination room. Once inside, he immediately looked for a place to hide, but eventually, he unwillingly ended up on the examination table. Xiaosui was brave today and even got two shots. After he was done, it was time for the other two puppies to get their checkups. Both of them were in good health, and before they realized it, the vet had already given them their deworming medication. This puppy was very well-behaved, so the check-up and deworming went quickly. The same routine applied to Xiao Hei. Although he didn't seem nervous, his eyes told a different story. After his shots, Xiaosui quietly rested in my niece's arms. Xiaosui has grown more handsome as he matures; his once-round head is now starting to form a bit of a dip. With all the check-ups complete, we took the three little ones home. Today, we finally decided on a name for Xiaosui's house: &quot;Following Along.&quot; Xiaosui now truly has a home and never needs to wander again; he's genuinely happy. On the sixty-eighth day, I noticed that Xiaosui didn't seem too fond of staying in his house. Perhaps the unfinished interior feels too spacious, making him uneasy, as he keeps trying to go indoors. So, today, I plan to remodel Xiaosui's house to make it cozier. Hopefully, he'll be more willing to stay inside. After painting, we'll let it dry for a few days before he moves in. Xiaosui stayed by our side today, keeping a watchful eye on our work. We carefully painted his house bit by bit. The white paint looked a little plain, so we decided to add some drawings around the outside of Xiaosui's house. With our strong sense of purpose, we immediately bought brushes and paint, and started decorating the exterior. Though our painting skills are quite basic, we didn't make Xiaosui's house look exceptionally beautiful. Still, I thought it held sentimental value. After I finished, my niece took her turn to paint. Xiao Hei and Helmet were very curious and ran over to see our painted walls. I brought out a blanket to serve as a mattress, so they could be comfortable. Once the blanket was arranged and the walls were painted, I laid the bedding inside the little house. Judging by Xiaosui's expression, he seems very satisfied with his new home. On the seventieth day, it was Mid-Autumn Festival, but we couldn't go home this year. So, we decided to make a special mooncake just for Xiaosui. We got an oven, ingredients, and a recipe guide ready for the occasion. Today, we made a very healthy mooncake for them, using ingredients suitable for dogs. With everything ready, we began by chopping and mixing all the ingredients. After letting the dough rest for thirty minutes, we used molds to shape the mooncakes. The dogs were getting so sleepy while waiting, but after shaping everything, we put the mooncakes in the oven. One of them couldn't wait any longer, staring eagerly at the oven. We couldn't serve them right away; as the treats cooled on the table, they watched intensely from the floor. I tried the first bite to check the temperature, and seeing it was perfect, I gave each of them a piece. They seemed to love it, eating happily in big bites. On the seventy-eighth day, Xiaosui has grown from a small puppy into a big dog. I bought Xiaosui a small camera to capture his perspective and see what he discovers. Just as we were putting it on him, Helmet showed up, clearly interested in the camera. However, Helmet was too small, so it didn't fit him well. In the end, Xiaosui proudly took on the role. Even before setting off, Xiaosui was already tired, lying on the ground. When we mentioned there'd be a canned food reward, he instantly perked up. We took him to the market, and from Xiaosui's perspective, we looked so tall. There were many cars passing by on the road, and Xiaosui kept standing in the middle; no matter how we tried, he wouldn't move. While we shopped, he patiently waited nearby. Xiaosui has become very outgoing and even started greeting people on his own. Everyone complimented him for being adorable, and he got plenty of attention. With the shopping done, we happily took Xiaosui back home. Xiaosui's filming mission was a complete success today. We rewarded him with the promised can of food right away. Xiao Hei and Helmet came over to join the fun as well. On the eighty-fifth day, it's been a long time since we taught Xiaosui any new commands. Today, we planned to teach him a few new tricks to see if he could learn. If he did well, we'd give him some treats. Xiaosui is growing in size but not height! I started by reviewing the commands we had taught him before, but he seemed to have forgotten them all. No matter how I guided him, he wouldn't budge, not even glancing my way when I demonstrated. I must have looked pretty funny trying so hard in front of him--I wonder what he thought of it. I gave up on teaching him new tricks for today, and Xiaosui seemed to lie down as if he'd given up too. Xiaosui is smart; he probably sensed I was talking about him and sulked in his bed. My niece comforted him, reminding him that learning takes time and can't be rushed. She kept encouraging Xiaosui, saying he would learn with patience. I patiently stayed by his side, guiding him step-by-step. With my help, Xiaosui finally learned some simple commands, proving he is indeed clever. Before long, Xiaosui fell asleep on the floor, while the cat quietly observed him. On the one hundred and ninth day, Xiaosui has grown more cheerful, and I've introduced him to many friends, keeping his spirits high. Thank you for watching!
