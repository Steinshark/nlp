(suspenseful music) - Oh, now let's go to the other side. Knife me. And now there's four ropes. Should we just do one more on each side and just get it done with? Akira, do you agree? - Okay. - [Jimmy] Aah. - There are now three ropes remaining. (heavy bass music) - You can win 7,000. You know what? You gotta jump in the pool. - You guys just don't budge. What do you want me to do? Just cut it down to one rope? - Let's do it. - Yeah. - Let's ask our consultant. Cameron, you were up there. You know how they feel.
