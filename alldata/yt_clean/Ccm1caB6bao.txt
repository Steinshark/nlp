&gt;&gt; This episode of the Modern Rogue brought to you by Privacy. &gt;&gt; Go to privacy.com/rogue and get five dollars of free money. &gt;&gt; Yeah, what's up, free money. Hi, knock knock, who's there? Free money, ya like it? Take it. &gt;&gt; Come on in. All right, we're back &gt;&gt; Hey brother. &gt;&gt; It's Babak Javadi and Deviant Ollam, thank you for joining us, gentlemen. &gt;&gt; So last time, you guys of what all's in a mag stripe. Help me understand why or are they even better? &gt;&gt; Marginally. [laughing] &gt;&gt; Well, that's a ringing endorsements. &gt;&gt; I am a little bit more kind. I think they are better in a lot of ways, but it's important to just like any of the stuff in the past, with locks, &gt;&gt; Would it be fair to is basically a piece of paper with numbers written down on it? &gt;&gt; Absolutely, that would be fair. &gt;&gt; And then this would be, what? A miniature computer, basically, or? &gt;&gt; That's actually very close, yeah. So, what we're doing, when they moved away from mag stripe technology to RFID, they were looking for long-term And also security. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; RFID is radio frequency identification? &gt;&gt; Radio frequency Now, it is important that the R, radio, in how a lot of people can think about radio. So normally, like, you know, if you're listening to the FM radio, you have a station transmitting And that can happen over miles, tens of miles. &gt;&gt; Right, you have a power source-- &gt;&gt; Exactly. about with HAM radio licenses, sometimes very intense power sources. And then other people &gt;&gt; Right, with RFID, it's You can't really do like &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not broadcasting radio. &gt;&gt; That's right. So you know, we talked it's just magnetizing parts of that rust, that dark rust basically. &gt;&gt; Exactly, right. And instead, they, you developed a technology that allowed them to electromagnetically couple with a coil that powers up this chip. And then that chip is able just by modulating its power draw. &gt;&gt; Wait, that's been but it was only introduced into debit and credit cards in the United &gt;&gt; Broadly, so, that's, this is like the predecessor to what you see today. &gt;&gt; Gotcha. &gt;&gt; So this is like old, old And then now what you have today is a lot of other stuff added on top of it. &gt;&gt; An iteration of it, okay. &gt;&gt; Yes, many iterations, actually. &gt;&gt; Am I right, and forgive me but is this the same kind of thing that charges my toothbruth, where it's like there's a magnet-- &gt;&gt; Same kind of technology. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And so this is-- &gt;&gt; Look at this, with his &gt;&gt; No, but like, I remember, I building a generator, right? You take a magnet and you so there's waves, and the receiving part of the generator. &gt;&gt; Similar idea, in fact, we have something that can show you. So, this is super cool, a lot of people have This is basically just a circuit and some coils. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be honest with you, this looks like this grants you access to some crazy supervillain club. &gt;&gt; It could, or it could just be a card that when you present you'll notice that the LEDs that light up indicate that a reader is and it's able to draw that &gt;&gt; So that card has no battery in it. &gt;&gt; That's correct. have its own power source. Whenever you see a reader like this, it's always offering power right &gt;&gt; So anybody who's weird better be scared of these &gt;&gt; I promise you they already are. &gt;&gt; So these guys are &gt;&gt; Yes, within a very small bubble, if that makes you feel &gt;&gt; Sure, the RFID card, I didn't know that it had an actual chip. For some reason, I thought it similar to a mag stripe. &gt;&gt; In effect, what we're how that number is transmitted. It is still just a number, but instead of it being it's just being transmitted wirelessly. The actual content is not changing, the means by which we transmit It's the difference between and handing it to you and me &gt;&gt; So, in other words, until you hold it and it gets power, then it wakes up and it goes, hello, I am 1266742! &gt;&gt; Over and over and over &gt;&gt; Is it re-programmable, though? &gt;&gt; Some are, the newer versions are. &gt;&gt; Okay, so some of them &gt;&gt; Yes, we're actually going to see how we can take advantage of that. &gt;&gt; Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. &gt;&gt; Yes, yes, be excited. &gt;&gt; All right, and since why should I be afraid? &gt;&gt; I would actually Here's why you should be informed, right? For example, Dev there has our friendly baggage handler's badge. &gt;&gt; From your local airport? &gt;&gt; From your local airport. &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Got it, okay. &gt;&gt; And that grants him access Now, what we're going to do is we're going to walk through a very basic card cloning technique just to show you how easily that number that we So right now, we have this And this card here, again, this is the same as the only difference is with clear PVC, just so you &gt;&gt; Now, I that the kind of is shout out a number? &gt;&gt; But I'm going to &gt;&gt; It's re-programmable, &gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's basically that &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; 100% right. &gt;&gt; Exactly. So right now, this card So, what we're going to a open-source tool called the Proxmark 3, and we're going to read &gt;&gt; And I assume this is &gt;&gt; It is, it is available So here we have the is actually saved inside this card, and that's what's being presented to the reader anytime it powers up. &gt;&gt; Now, how complicated are those numbers? Are we talking like four-digit, or it something lengthy and complex? &gt;&gt; Not as long as you might think. Anywhere between 26 and which is not a very long number. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, what about Because this looks pretty, like, if I could buy one of these, I assume this software is &gt;&gt; Unfortunately this particular software is a little bit more &gt;&gt; It's open source, man! &gt;&gt; It's going to work better. &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. so, get ready for 20 anybody can do any of this. &gt;&gt; It's all totally if you're willing to invest the time. &gt;&gt; So at this point, I assume it's just like You're going to do something &gt;&gt; I am going to do something. Right, the first something I'm going to do is I'm going to turn this into a card. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, because this can be reprogrammed to behave as a reader or as a card, I can actually tell it instead of reading, what I'll do is I'll give it a command to simulate that same data. &gt;&gt; So right now, it's just blasting. It's using its own source of power, it's not drawing from that-- &gt;&gt; Okay, it's just &gt;&gt; All right, so we've gone So I'm actually just Go ahead and present it to &gt;&gt; Okay. [beeps] &gt;&gt; Boom, simple, you're authorized. &gt;&gt; Simple, but like-- &gt;&gt; And you looked so legit doing it. &gt;&gt; We can't have him running around the facility like this, right? &gt;&gt; I wouldn't recommend it. &gt;&gt; I would love to see that, he's like pretending but he's got a laptop in there. &gt;&gt; I've known people that and there, they got a &gt;&gt; Instead, remember this card? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That currently does not work. So we're going to place that back on here. &gt;&gt; These blank programmable Are they, how much do they cost? &gt;&gt; Yeah, so, they're super &gt;&gt; Yeah. So we're actually going to tell it instead to reprogram this card and if it wrote correctly, Go ahead and grab that card and present it to the [beeps] &gt;&gt; What do these run? &gt;&gt; About $300. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, a little pricey, but not-- &gt;&gt; Not terrible. &gt;&gt; Achievable. &gt;&gt; Now, to be fair, there of different RFID card We're just talking about like like Prox, for example, For Prox specifically, because there's really cheap, cloners available out on like AliExpress and stuff. &gt;&gt; They're like a little &gt;&gt; They're going to do nothing but Prox. And if that's your only then that's going to be much easier. But this is cool because this This allows you to interact with almost any kind of credential if you're willing to put &gt;&gt; If you're trying to do you go up to the card reader and have to do research and determine, okay, it's this type, and so I have to get the right type of these? &gt;&gt; Yes and no, so, you do and intelligence gathering. That's one of the things when we teach other is we spend a lot of time different card technologies just by taking photos. Dev has taken tons of photos, so we can [snaps] just like that see what kind of card it is. &gt;&gt; Question, question, a key fob is just one of these with a battery in it? &gt;&gt; No battery. &gt;&gt; No, same exact, just &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Smaller coil, smaller enclosure. &gt;&gt; Today, I learned. &gt;&gt; That's it, today, we all learned. &gt;&gt; And much like your key your card may have branding on it. Many times the readers have branding and certain very unique visual elements. We say, oh well, look, well, that's IO Prox. Oh, look at this, the light &gt;&gt; So in both of these examples, you get your hands on the credentials and then you duplicate them. Is there a version, let's I don't know, the gizmo, What can you do then? &gt;&gt; Well, you know how with credit cards, skimming is such a problem? &gt;&gt; Yeah, same problem exists &gt;&gt; That doesn't seem you just put a thing over the thing and then they slide through the thing. &gt;&gt; Or putting it behind the thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There's different things &gt;&gt; Imagine a big company you can think of a couple, that has one of these scanner devices just outside, unprotected. You could go up to any number of those and put something in there. 60 seconds and no one no one would know. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you get two guys matching polo shirts, one kind of look like you belong there. He's watching me, make and I'm just underneath it, swinging, push, punch, reload, gone. &gt;&gt; This is the moment you realize that that's way too polished to That is definitely a factual All right, so walk me through this. You guys show up wearing fluorescent pennies &gt;&gt; Sure, whatever works. &gt;&gt; Doing whatever this &gt;&gt; So, what Dev is going to and take the reader off the mount. It's important to consider that, you know, this type of problem is valid on almost any card reader. It's not specific to &gt;&gt; I would not have thought to bust one of these open. &gt;&gt; And now what you're seeing is on the back of the reader, we so we have our power and our ground, our LED control, and then These two wires, the white and green ones, these are the two wires to send that card back to the door controller, whether or not that &gt;&gt; Okay now, in this I assume that's what, like a tamper alarm? &gt;&gt; That's a tamper alarm that I installed. Truth be told, 99% of But I installed it how easy some of these tamper &gt;&gt; DEV: If you look at in addition to the wires, do you see something else &gt;&gt; That's a magnet because what looks like a house alarm there. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Wait, so of course, you &gt;&gt; [beep]ing magnets, how do they work? &gt;&gt; Magnets are behind 99% of penetrations. &gt;&gt; Go ahead and put that reader back on and if you put the magnet, as you take the reader off-- &gt;&gt; It's very &quot;Indiana Jones.&quot; &gt;&gt; Yes, yes! Okay, and so I see I assume you installed something. &gt;&gt; That's correct, this is actually one of these devices here. &gt;&gt; Right here. This is a kind of interception tool. It's a credential skimmer, but a credential skimmer. So this is installed on the &gt;&gt; You mentioned the is it just those? &gt;&gt; Well, and power as well. So this, because it siphons its power off of the same power that goes to the reader. &gt;&gt; But it does have wifi. &gt;&gt; And so, you're storing stuff here and sending it to your phone, I guess, or a computer. So right now, that little guy anytime someone uses their card to get in, they, to them, everything is normal. But that ESP key is now and because I can I can actually connect to it here. So we're connected right So this webpage is not being this is being served up &gt;&gt; And that's a log of everybody &gt;&gt; This is a log of everyone So I can actually just on and when I want to come in, I don't even have to clone their card. I can just walk up to the door, tap the credential I want, &gt;&gt; So not only can you get access, but you could decide into thinking is coming and coming. &gt;&gt; Correct, oh yeah. &gt;&gt; You don't just have a key, &gt;&gt; Yes. And when we dump that kind if we look and say, oh look at all these people Not only does that tell us things like, well, when the building is empty, but if we see someone and then 2:30, and then that's a guard doing a guard tour. If I want to be somebody, &gt;&gt; It didn't even occur that there's value in just letting it run for a month, never penetrating anything the habits and the comings &gt;&gt; And I have all those credentials, I can take this same card information and I can use that Proxmark &gt;&gt; That is extraordinary. &gt;&gt; And it's not just one, &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; How much does one of these cost? &gt;&gt; 08 bucks. &gt;&gt; Goddammit, it's just, it's and I can't believe it, how cheap this is. &gt;&gt; I don't know that I'll ever but-- &gt;&gt; Well, I would very much like and just kind of going. [laughing] Do you have the briefcase? &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, let's say Jason Murphy did want to become an expert, what would be the best &gt;&gt; We actually have professional You can over to readteamalliance.com to check out our schedule. In fact, if you take the I'll probably be your instructor. &gt;&gt; Nice! Gentlemen, thank you so much, &gt;&gt; Absolutely, guys. &gt;&gt; Murphy, I'm losing &gt;&gt; Wow, okay, I'll handle What's going on? &gt;&gt; Everybody on the internet! They're all like, oh, some kind of switcheroo, with freaking privacy! What they don't understand is that every credit card company out they're making all their money on the fact that they're charging you for interest, they're charging the vendors and then on top of that, they sell all of your Except for one institution, privacy.com! &gt;&gt; I order comic books from that I'm not real debit or credit card information. Like, it's a ship in international waters filled with &quot;X-Men&quot; trade paperbacks that fell off of a truck. &gt;&gt; This took a very &gt;&gt; But I do that and I'm like, well, I'm don't want to put my actual card information in there, &gt;&gt; What you wish is that you could press that would that you could use to buy that stuff that would never, ever &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, it is so good, just go to privacy.com/rogue, get five free dollars to spend on it. Try it out with those five free dollars! It is so worth it! You're protecting yourself, [static] &gt;&gt; You guys know that every week, we do a free giveaway in the This week, it's super special!
