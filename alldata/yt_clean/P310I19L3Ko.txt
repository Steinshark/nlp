PLEASE WELCOME TO THE STAGE, WITH BLOOMBERG'S ASHLEE VANCE. MODERATOR: HELLO. IT'S SORT OF A VICTORY OF SORTS A FEW YEARS AGO I WROTE A BOOK TALK TO ME FOR A LONG TIME I HAVE JUST WRITTEN A BOOK STILL TALKING TO ME. I LIKE THAT YOU SPENT SO MUCH ME OUT. [APPLAUSE] ASHLEY: MAYBE WE'LL FIGURE YOU OUT WHILE I WAS DOING THIS BOOK, I IT HANGING OUT WITH YOU AND A THE WORLD, I DUG INTO THE IF YOU LOOK OVER THE LAST 20 ABOUT 12 LEGITIMATE ROCKET SPACEX IS LAUNCHING ABOUT EVERY YOU GUYS HAVE LAUNCHED DOZENS TWICE A WEEK, IF YOU WANT TO. QUICKLY. TWO AND THEN REALLY AT FITS AND I MEAN, IT'S AMAZING, BECAUSE PROGRAMS AT THESE OTHER WHAT IS IT THAT YOU AND SPACE X THE ENTIRE REST OF THE INDUSTRY THAT IS A DIFFICULT QUESTION. EXECUTION. FANFARE. RADAR AND WE JUST KEEP THE GREAT THING ABOUT THE SPACE THE SPACE INDUSTRY. CAN SIT ON THE STAGE AND SAY, TO JUPITER 2030. RANDY WILL GO, YUP, COOL. SUCH CRAZY THINGS AND GET THAT IS A GREAT THING ABOUT THE DREAMS AND MID EXECUTION. SPACE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN PRETTY YOU CAN SAY THOSE THINGS AND OUT OF THE ROOM, BUT AT THE END BETWEEN THOSE THINGS BEING ASHLEE: YOU AND ROCKET LAB AND SPACE IT IS AMAZING TO WATCH PEOPLE STRUGGLE. SCIENCE, WE KNOW THAT THIS IS ON THE OTHER HAND, ROCKET LAB THAT REALLY HAD NEVER BUILT A COLLEGE FOR THIS AND YOU WERE POINT. PETER: ASHLEE: [LAUGHS] SOMETHING OUT THAT GOT IT RIGHT. PETER: RIGHT TEAM, SETTING THE RIGHT BUSINESS AROUND IT, BEING KIND YOU BUILD YOUR COMPANY. AT THE END OF THE DAY, I HAVE TO SOMEBODY, -- WE HAVE A MOTTO TO DO. WILL DO SOMETHING AND YOU DO IF YOU CONTINUE TO DO THAT ALL BUILDING THE COMPANY. ASHLEE: SINCE I HAVE KNOWN YOU, YOU ARE CASESVERY HANDS-ON, YOU BUILD A CASESVERY HANDS-ON, NEW ZEALAND STARTED. YOU ARE BUILDING A ROCKET FROM THE ONLY COMMERCIAL ROCKET THAT IS SPREAD ACROSS TWO YOU ARE THIS SURGE OF CASESVERY HANDS-ON -- YOU ARE THIS VERY I JUST WONDER HOW YOU ARE ATTENTION IS GEOGRAPHICALLY IT'S A GOOD CHALLENGE. COMPANIES. BUT I THINK THAT AS LONG AS THE AND PEOPLE FOLLOW THE RULES, COMPANY, YOU DON'T NECESSARILY THE ROCKET ENGINE TO THE BACK THE GUY WHO IS ACTUALLY THE BACK OF THE LAUNCH VEHICLE AND ALL THE CULTURAL ASPECTS TO SO IT IS DEFINITELY CHALLENGING. PLANE THAN EVER. BUT IT'S FUN. TWO THIRDS OF OUR BUSINESS IS STILL EAGER TO DO SOME REALLY -- I STILL GET TO DO SOME I THINK ABOUT COMMERCIAL SPACE ROCKET COMPANIES. DOWN AND WE ARE LAUNCHING MORE SATELLITE COMPANIES PUTTING UP IT REMINDS ME SO MUCH OF 1996 COMPANIES , COMPANIES DELAYING AND SAYING SOMETHING INCREDIBLE INTERNET. OBVIOUS THAT THERE WOULD BE THE INTERNET, WE JUST DIDN'T IN SPACE, THE FIRST BIG MESSAGE SATELLITES AND IMAGING THAT IS THE ENTIRE PREMISE OF LARGE DEGREE. I AM SO CURIOUS ABOUT, DO YOU SEE THAT AS BEING ENOUGH FOR DO YOU THINK SOMETHING HAS TO I THINK ABOUT THIS A LOT PROMISE OF THE INDUSTRY AND DEPENDING ON WHICH MARKET $1 TRILLION OR $2 TRILLION, HOW 2030. ME THAT ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN FUNDAMENTAL USE CASES FROM OBVIOUSLY, ELI HAS STARLINK AND AMAZON HAS THEIR OWN COMPANY WE ARE SEEING APPLE WITH THE THERE IS ENOUGH ROOM USE CASES BIT OBVIOUS NOW THAT IT WILL BUT ALL OF THAT STUFF IS REALLY FOR NOW, WE WENT FROM 2500 ABOUT 10,000 TODAY. EXPONENTIAL CURVE AFTER IT HAD A HUGE CHUNK OF THAT IS I JUST ALWAYS THINK I COULD SEE THAT STUFF MAKE MONEY? OTHERWISE THE AIR STARTS TO QUICK. PETER: THAT IS FAIR. IN THE LAST, I WOULD SAY 10 TREMENDOUS AMOUNT VENTURE BUSINESS MODEL'S AND SOME HAVE OTHERS, NOT SO SUCCESSFUL. THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SEEING WHAT STICKS. NOW YOU HAVE AMAZON BUILDING SERVICE CUSTOMERS. AS COMMS, BUT AMAZON HAS A INTERNET TO PEOPLE, IT IMPROVES SO IN SPACE, PEOPLE OFTEN FIND A MARKET FOR. HAPPENING WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY THAT DRIVE PUTTING GOVERNMENT IS THE SAME. OR TWO BIG STATIONARY ASSETS&quot; ASHLEE: SOME PEOPLE BEYOND MANUFACTURING. INTERESTING THING WHERE YOU PARTNERED WITH THIS COMPANY, VARDA, WHICH IS MAKING A IT WENT ON THE SPACEX ROCKET. COMPANIES, TWO OF WHICH ARE QUASI-COMPETITORS. CHEMICALS AND MOLECULES IN THERE IS TALK ABOUT MOVING DATA REDUCING POLLUTION ON EARTH, POWERED. JUMP OUT TO YOU AS THE MOST I AM NOT SO SURE THAT LAUNCHING BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAN KEEPING THEM ON THE GROUND, BUT PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY. ENVIRONMENT, CRYSTAL PROTEINS THAT IS PROCESS FROM GRAVITY, IT IS IT HAS ONLY BEEN UNTIL NOW THAT AT ANY LEVEL OF SCALE. YOU JUST WOULDN'T DO THAT. $100 MILLION JUST TO TRY. PETER: DOLLARS, YOU CAN HAVE A CRACK IF WE COULD JUST PUT UP A SLIDE I FOUND THIS FASCINATING. NOT TRYING TO HAWK MY BOOK BUT OF THIS POLL. MOST MONEY IS NOT TOURISM, IT'S EARTH ORBIT WHERE SATELLITES SO I AM JUST CURIOUS, THIS IS MOST PROGRESS. PETER: ME, MAYBE I SHOULD GET WORKING CLEARLY I AM MISSING A TRICK. BUT YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN YEMEN SPACE TRAVEL. PETER: NO, THAT IS -- IN YEMEN I ADMIRE ASTRONAUTS. NOT THE COURAGE. DISLOCATE YOURSELF FROM ALL THE SUPERPOWER TO BE ABLE TO DO WHERE DO YOU MAKE OF THAT, THAT WHERE THIS IS HEADING, AS BUSINESS? PETER: MARKETING FROM VIRGIN GALACTIC. MORE SERIOUSLY, MORE PEOPLE SPACE. BEEN THE DRAW CARD. THING TO WATCH A ROCKET GOING IT'S ALWAYS IN MAGNITUDE DIFFERENT AND THAT IS KIND OF NOT SURPRISING THAT EVERYBODY ASHLEE: HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT. SPACEX MAKES LARGE ROCKETS, YOU MOVING FORWARD YOU'RE MAKING WILL COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH AT THE SAME TIME SPACEX IS CALLED STARSHIP. WITH ELON COMES WITH ITS I AM JUST VERY CURIOUS IF YOU AS YOUR MOST DIRECT COMPETITOR COMPANY THAT SEEMS TO HAVE A IN SOME RESPECTS, A LOT OF BUT WE ARE ON OUR OWN JOURNEY. AT THE END OF THE DAY, LIKE IF IT IS THIS EXCITING TO I AM TRYING TO BUILD A COMPANY. ARE GOING TO HAVE THEIR OWN BUILD THEIR OWN SATELLITE AND APPLICATIONS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS THE ENDGAME HERE. YOUR OWN SPACECRAFT, THEN YOU NOBODY ELSE CAN DO. IN THAT SENSE, SPACEX HAS MOVING QUICKLY TO PROVE THAT SUCCESSFUL OR NOT, BUT NUMBER OF THOSE AND THE AT WILL ARE THE ONES WHO WILL I KNOW ASHLEE: AM JUST CURIOUS, WE HAVE JUST BOUGHT A NUMBER OF THEIR PARTS. ROCKET COMPANIES AND SATELLITE YOU HAVE BEEN IN SOFTWARE, YOU BIGGER THAN THAT. THAT? PETER: IN THE FUTURE, IF YOU BUY INTO SATELLITES TO ALL OF IT. PETER: ASHLEE: DO YOU THINK IT IS A TWO PETER: I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE 10. THE REALITY IS THAT LAUNCHING A AND GOING TO ORBIT IS AN IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO DO. CAN HAVE BETTER COMPUTING, DAY , IT IS 1.1 TO 1.2 TIMES EVERY SINGLE THING IN THE IF YOU LOOK AT A ROCKET ENGINE, ROCKET ENGINE HAS NOT REALLY THE ACTUAL COMBUSTION JUST INCREASED THE PRESSURE. PHYSICS AND MATERIALS A LONG YOU SEE IS WEEKS AROUND THE OR IN ELON'S SCALE, YOU JUST IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY ALWAYS GOING DO. ASHLEE: WHAT IS YOUR NEXT LAUNCH, AND GUYS BE DOING? PETER: AND THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF ASHLEE: IT USED TO BE THIS ALL OR WE ARE LAUNCHING EVERY COUPLE PROBABLY THE NEXT CABIN OF VEHICLE. ASHLEE: ASHLEE: THE TRUTH THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW FAR THIS BUSINESS HAS COME. [APPLAUSE] PETER: THANK YOU.
