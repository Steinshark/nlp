(voices overlapping) Let's than two minutes after takeoff, Flight 1121 crashes into the Pacific. (plane crashing) - [Waitress] Oh my God. - [Narrator] News that a plane crashed, and narrowly missed the town of Staines is soon the top story across the country. Within an hour, the news a new investigator with Britain's Accidents - At the time that I arrived on the site the rescue attempt had started big time, and the site was very, - [Narrator] Investigators are In most accidents, momentum forward after it hits the ground. The crash at Staines is different. - The tail had not moved very far from where it had initially And the rest of the aircraft probably hadn't moved forwards Which for such a heavy airplane is very, very little distance. - [Narrator] Nearby power - The older investigators, the power lines, which it had passed over very, very shortly before - If you walked around of the tail unit, you could and there were overhead This told you really the coming down as the very steep angle in order not to interfere with the cables. - [Narrator] The undamaged tell investigators that the plane fell to the ground suddenly and steeply. (plane roaring) It's a sure sign that the plane stalled. (wind whistling) - All the sort of basic impact signs were that the aircraft was stalled. The first question is why. - [Narrator] London's Heathrow Airport. - B Line 548 requesting start. - [Narrator] The crew of British is completing final preparations for an afternoon flight to Brussels. Captain Stanley Key was but was called in at the last minute. Key is a former Royal Air Force pilot, and one of the airlines - Starter master, on.

(alarm beeping) - What was that? - [Narrator] The plane (dramatic music) - Look at the speed! Look at the speed! (dramatic music continues) (plane exploding) - [Narrator] All 118 people aboard BEA flight 548 are killed. At AIB headquarters, engineers piece together By testing the reassembled systems, investigators should be able to tell if there was a broken that could have caused the stall. They soon notice a problem. - That can't be right. - A lever is set to an It's used to operate crucial known as droops. Droops are aerodynamic surfaces that can be extended from They increase lift during Droops should only be has enough speed to If one of the pilots pulled it would have instantly put the plane into a dangerous stall. There's no way to tell just whether the crew moved or if it was jostled out of It might even have been moved - Hang on, will you? - [Narrator] To determine was last moved, they the cables connected to it. (suspenseful music) - Retracted. - [Narrator] There's no longer any doubt. Someone in the cockpit It's a troubling discovery. They travel to BEA's flight The team hears about a nagging problem for pilots of the Trident plane. The handle use to retract the same shape as the one - [Investigator] I can see - B Line 548, climbing has cleared. - [Narrator] It's the to raise the flaps after takeoff. - [Tower] 548, airborne - Roger. - [Narrator] But the third - 85 Seconds. - [Narrator] If the flaps were already up, it would be all too easy to If their theory is right, to find other cases where The team reviews the flight records from nearly 100 other Trident flights. - It's not just this crew. - [Narrator] They find two near accidents, where pilots pulled in It now seems the crash of BEA Flight 548 was the result of a confusion Authorities implement a number of changes designed to prevent similar Handles on the Trident, and other planes are redesigned to eliminate And cockpit voice recorders in almost all commercial passenger planes. (gentle music) Los Angeles International Airport. Hughes Airwest Flight There are 44 passengers on board. - Welcome aboard, folks. We'll be getting underway any minute now. - [Narrator] Captain Theodore - Roger. 24 left. Climb heading 250. - [Narrator] First Officer, Price Bruner is also highly experienced. - Runway's clear. Throttles are all yours. - [Narrator] At 6:02PM, lifts off from LA. 372 miles from Los Angeles, Marine pilot, James Richard Phillips, and radar intercept is one of a group of fighters air intercepts over the The F-4's high altitude - So there's no way to - [Narrator] And the mechanics - Sir, it's return shy? Yes, sir. Will do. Yeah, they still want us - [Narrator] To avoid using - [James] Just keep it nice and low. - [Narrator] They've been At 5:15 PM the F-4 takes off. Pilot Rick Phillips cruises If it weren't for the oxygen problem, he could fly much higher, and clear of commercial At around 6:00 PM, the to avoid the mountains ahead - [Control] Copy Rick. Climb to 15,000. - [Narrator] There's a basic an aviation called see and avoid. It's every pilot's job to Investigators wonder why did not take any action - He's coming in at 420 knots The DC9 is coming in at 320 knots from the southwest. - [Control] Okay, 040, direct to Daggot. - What's the rate of closure? - [Narrator] In the Radar Operator Schiess has his Pilot Phillips is likely - At 15 seconds, the F-4 in the window, tiny. 10 seconds, 3/10 of an inch. Still tiny, but maybe now he can see it. Five seconds, the entire window's filled. - Just another hazy day. - [Christopher] Watch it!

How do you hear me? (wind whining) (aircraft exploding) - What the hell happened? - [Narrator] A DC9, has slammed into the California Hills. Controllers should have and warn Hughes Airwest Flight 706 that it was on a collision course. Investigators hope recordings will tell them more about what But the controllers on duty that day say the fighter didn't - I would've warned Hughes - [Narrator] And they have There appears to be no way to explain why the radar system in Then investigators about the equipment installed there. The system may not have to accurately track a Investigators conduct a radar test. They fly an F-4 along the route to see whether it can be - Was that something there? (plane roaring) - The F-4 does six runs. The controller can barely - It might have been (tense music) - [Narrator] They conclude to detect the Marine F-4 as To make matters worse, in 1971, military pilots were not routinely briefed on civilian air traffic flights. And the military plane to check in with civilian The investigators reach Air transportation in The military and civilian The exhaustive investigation One civilian and one military. They cover every detail The reports lead to important changes in the rules governing aviation. Military pilots are now air traffic zones near The size and shape of No longer merely spokes on at busy airports now Lessons learned from the accident helped force changes that make passengers safer to this day. - Left, left! - [Narrator] The to level the plane he believed actually put the aircraft into a deadly spiraling dive to the right. (aircraft exploding) But there's a troubling question. Even if the captain was why didn't the First and take steps to save the plane? Investigators wonder First Officer Kolesar from - Coming level 110, Crossair 498. - It was the First Officer's - Taper it off. - [Kolesar] It's coming. - [Narrator] But he had an extra challenge during Flight 498. - Turning left to Zurich - [Narrator] The plane's was a new addition to the cockpit. Cockpit design is a complicated process. Pilots need to be able to as well as monitor a vast including the artificial horizon, located directly in front of them. Investigators wonder if made it difficult for the First Officer to see what was going on. To find out, they conduct - Okay, let's begin. - [Control] B1. - [Narrator] They reconstruct the flight to see exactly where the when things started to go wrong. - Gear up. - Gear is up. - [Control] Crossair 498, - [Pavel] Climbing Coming. away from the artificial horizon. - Now he's looking here. Now I can look up. - [Narrator] By the time the First Officer could see what was happening, the plane was already - Turning left to Zurich - [Tower] Crossair 498, - Please standby. (alarm beeping) - The first officer's stress shows he knew there was a serious problem. - Left! Left! - [Narrator] The captain thought He didn't understand what his First Officer - Left! (plane roaring) (aircraft exploding) - [Narrator] After the the airline improved training for pilots from former Soviet block countries. They now get three months They also must pass an Finally, all Swiss crews are now required to engage the autopilot ensuring that they can to the progress of the flight. None of the crash Investigators reexamine the the pilot's comments And the information from - Turning left to Zurich - [Narrator] The timing convinces investigators that but that he didn't understand what the gauges were telling him. - Left! Left, left! - [Narrator] The troubling question, how could a qualified that he didn't know the (aircraft exploding) The search for an answer where captain Gruzin learned to fly. - Thank you for seeing us. - [Narrator] They meet with Both pilots were highly qualified. There seems to be no reason until the Russian investigators They tell investigators about a troubling cluster of accidents caused becoming confused by a Pilots in the Soviet using an artificial horizon from the one used in Western planes. - Turning left to Zurich - [Narrator] In the West, the remains stable, as the background moves. Soviet horizons work in the opposite way. The airplane symbol shows the motion, and the horizon is fixed in place. A left turn on a Soviet to a right turn on a Western display. In his confusion, he became convinced he was in a steep left turn. He was turning right to try - Left! Left! - [Narrator] The to level the plane he believed actually put the aircraft into a deadly spiraling dive to the right. (aircraft exploding) Investigators learned for more than an hour while - 60 degrees in Tampa, and - Definitely be good to get home. - [Narrator] If ice and snow during the delay, it could have prevented the plane from climbing. Ice and snow can interrupt the flow of air over the plane's wings, decreasing lift. - The importance of deicing Even a small amount of contamination can affect the performance of a wing, whether it's a light (contemplative music) - [Narrator] They examined deicing records from the day of the crash. - They were very, very interested in how efficient that deicing had been. - [Narrator] Air Florida's procedures called for a powerful deicing solution, one designed for very cold days. - Basically what happens dissolves the snow and ice So when it's first put on it's doing quite a good job. - [Narrator] Records reveal sprayed on Flight 90 - They honed in on the issue the mixture that was used, the procedures that were followed. - [Narrator] Deicing according to of the outside temperature. - It's the deicing fluid. - [Narrator] If the mixture it might have allowed ice - You wanna pass me that - [Narrator] Investigators recorded at the airport They find that the fluid - They figured they'd go right behind- - [Narrator] Though it the mixture was strong enough for the temperatures recorded - Sloppy work, but shouldn't - Other aircraft did depart, which means that things were What was wrong with that caused the crash? - Come on. I've got an idea. - [Narrator] With little NTSB investigator, John McAdele comes up with an unusual way to analyze the power coming from Flight 90's engines, by analyzing the sound they made. Jet engines contain turbines depending on how quickly they're spinning. When the engine needs more and the frequency of the sound changes. - You ready to go? - Yeah. - [Narrator] The sound should tell McAdele how much And thanks to the unique with its engines mounted he already has a recording They play back the cockpit voice recorder in a soundproof room. - Power at 20. B1. Easy. - Can you take the stick shaker out? - [Larry] Forward, - Lose the crew voices. - [Larry] Forward, forward. - [Narrator] The technician eliminates the other sounds in until all that's left is (engines roaring) The results are dramatic. Investigators now know that weren't running at full What they don't know is why. McAdele has no hard evidence but he decides to follow a hunch. He uses a piece of tape to simulate the effect of ice He recreates the actions of the pilots on the day of the flight. - Okay. Start her up. - [Narrator] And he records from inside the cockpit. - Keep throttling up. - [Narrator] He increases power, until the engine gauges match the target set by the crew of Flight 90. - Got it. - [Narrator] Blocking the should create the same as on Flight 90. Both engines should sound identical. - Okay. Let's see what we've got. (engines roaring) - [Narrator] McAdele compares to the engine noise captured - That's a perfect match. - [Narrator] Investigators degraded the plane's performance. When combined with low it was enough to rob the pilots of the lift they needed to climb. The Air Florida disaster for better flight safety In the aftermath of this around the world improved so that pilots can deice near the runway just before takeoff. Powerful technology now helping airports avoid long Since the Air Florida better understand the November 12th, 2001. It's the Veteran's Day a day off for many. But at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport it's another busy day. Flight 587 lifts off at 9:14 AM. - [Tower] American 587, heavy. - [Narrator] 2300 feet above (dramatic music) - Oh my God! Oh my God, oh my- - [Narrator] The plane is losing altitude, and falling out of the sky. - Holy crap. - [Narrator] And the plane is heading straight for the houses - The sound, at first, was just a normal airplane flying above. I was still in bed, kind of As it started to get louder, that's when you felt a little vibration. - Oh my God! - We're stuck in it. - [Computerized Voice] There's an aircraft crashing. - Airplane going down. - Get out of it. Get out (plane roaring) - The house started This all happened really quick. (dramatic music) (aircraft exploding) - [Narrator] The fuel engulfing several homes. (alarms blaring) - My whole window was bright orange, really loud, really bright. I just jumped up, looking for with my dad, ran out to - Are you missing any flights? American Airlines, Flight 587. - We ran out the front door. All I could see, 'cause I couldn't find my glasses. The whole street was covered in flames. My whole side of my house And there was black smoke - What the hell happened? - I remember looking back into my house, and the whole kitchen area was just black. It was all thick black smoke already. - [Narrator] Fire rips through And a city still in shock is plunged back into fear and chaos. Was this terrorism, or was it an accident? Flight 587 crashed in Queens. - [Investigator] Look - [Narrator] Investigators turn the unusual rudder movements. - 11 degrees left. 11 degrees right. Could he have ripped the - [Narrator] Normally a couple of degrees in either Investigators wonder if the on Flight 587 created needed to tear the stabilizer off. - You ready? - [Narrator] To find out, they create a computer and fly it the same way moving the rudder 11 degrees (dramatic music) - There. That would've done it. - [Narrator] The what happened to American But it doesn't explain why. It's clear the pilot handling the amount of wake turbulence they experienced on takeoff. But that's not what They don't understand would move his rudders so Investigators believe the First Officer was following his training when he overreacted to wake turbulence. They learned that some trainees were presented with an - [Instructor] For this just ahead of you. When you encounter his - [Narrator] They were would induce the sudden roll. - The wake turbulence rarely tilts you more than 10 degrees in any direction, and it's easily recoverable. - Unfortunately, the The airplane banked one and then went very strongly to 90 degrees, which is a tremendous bank - [Narrator] The only way to recover is with sustained rudder inputs. - Little wake turbulence, huh? - Yeah. - [Narrator] First Officer that severe weight turbulence could cause a catastrophic upset. - The First Officer began responding with wheel back and forth, a back and forth rudder. - Hang on to it, hang on to it. - He thought it was or something else that was happening. And he was making opposite controls, and was fighting himself, and didn't know that it that were causing the problem. - [Narrator] The First Officer's actions stressed the vertical stabilizer, (metal ripping) until it breaks under the strain. After the accident, its training procedures - Once it became clear was going on, American revamped the program to - [Narrator] The training simulator has been modified to be more realistic. Inputs have an immediate effect. Pilots are now taught not to A new warning light is also to help prevent pilots too far during flight. NOAA 42 was to descend just before entering the storm, Hurricane Hugo. 30 minutes behind NOAA 42, was also heading for the storm, at a much higher altitude, 10,000 feet. NOAA 42 was the first The G forces are some of the most powerful ever recorded in any hurricane, and far beyond what the plane A broken sensor couldn't properly regulate the amount of fuel flowing to the engine. When the sensor failed- - We're losing number three. - [Narrator] It fed too and it ignited into a stream of flames. - Emergency shut down handle. - [Narrator] Pulling the handle and douses the flames. But the loss of an engine has and they're still losing altitude. - More power. Oh, thank God. - I've never been happier to - [Narrator] The crippled emerging into the relative (waves crashing) The world is watching as Hurricane Hugo churns across the Atlantic. It's a massive cyclone, The storm is marching and threatens to hit land On dozens of islands, and people rush to get out of Hugo's path. But high above the ocean, has to try to exit out of the storm. The only way out of the But with only three engines at this low altitude would be suicidal. Their best hope is the still approaching in the storm. - [Captain] NOAA 42 to Teal 57. We've had an emergency - [Narrator] Once the it might be able to fly close enough for the crew to assess the damage. - Teal 57, we're gonna need a favor. I don't know if we can climb You coming down to us? - Roger NOAA 42, starting our dissent. - No sudden moves. They're on us. - NOAA 42, you look like Other than that deicing boot. - Teal 57, gonna need another favor. We can't stay in here. Fuel's gonna be an issue very soon. Can you help us find a soft spot? - Roger that. We'll see what we can find. - [Narrator] Onboard NOAA 42, there's nothing to do but wait. (dramatic music) - Any word yet, guys? - NOAA 42, I think I - [Narrator] The Air Force plane has found a possible exit point. - Try the Northeast quadrant. - Roger, Northeast quadrant. We'll see you back at base. - Let's hope they're right. - [Narrator] NOAA 42 is going to try to punch through the storm at 6,000 feet. They hope the winds at this altitude will be less destructive. - [Co-Pilot] Set condition one. - [Narrator] The Air Force crew has chosen the exit point well. There is far less - That's more like it. - [Narrator] After a back through the storm the crew finally escapes - Oh my God. - What a day. - Yeah, a little too close Teal 57, we're out and, - All part of the service. We'll see you guys back on dry land. (calm music) - [Narrator] After their harrowing ordeal, everyone on board gets (calm music continues) - Well, the first thing we've gotta do, is find the rest of this plane. - Taylor's first job is to fund a new search of - [Frank] Yes. Could you - [Narrator] It could cost millions. And there's no guarantee - No, I. We absolutely have The basic conclusion was that we needed to And we said so very clearly. There's no way to make any conclusions without more of the wreckage. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thanks very much. Thank you. Bye. - [Narrator] If anyone it would be Taylor. During the Lockerbie investigation, he helped create a software program to locate widely scattered debris. - You have two effects. How far a piece will that the aircraft was and how far it'll be blown downwind by whatever winds there are. But the computer can do this very easily. - [Narrator] Taylor convinces that his program can find more wreckage. - Okay. Altitude around 24,000. - [Narrator] They approve his request for a new salvage operation. - Wind is westerly, about 100 knots. - [Narrator] But the (dramatic music) - That's where we should be looking. Wind data was available. So we could feed that into our computer. And it told us, more or less, where the rest of the wreckage would be. - [Narrator] The strategy works. The effort soon recovers - And eventually we found it. It was there, more or less, of where we predicted. - [Narrator] Itavia Flight reveals a new hole at It appears to have been caused by a bomb. - Yes. Well we know what that is. - [Narrator] Investigators from that part of the plane. Well, look at you. - [Narrator] The steel wash by an explosion, just what if a bomb exploded in the rear lavatory. - The more we discovered, back to an explosion in - [Narrator] Taylor and enough evidence to say what (loud banging) - I think it was a bomb. - [Narrator] There's just one more test they need to do to be sure. - Okay. Let's blow it - Investigators place to test their theory that a - [Tower] Three, two, one. (bomb explodes) - [Narrator] If the shattered pieces match Flight 870's debris. - Okay, let's go see how we did. - [Narrator] It will that they're right. The explosion creates distinctive damage. It's nearly identical to what was seen in the debris from the - Okay. Measure that one, will you? Yep. We were absolutely sure. Yes, yes, there's no doubt. - [Narrator] The evidence can't But investigators now have a Based on the physical evidence, the aircraft's last radar return, and the location of debris, a clear picture of Flight - Itavia 870, call back for descent. - Thank you for everything. We'll call you for descent. 870. - What? - There's explosion close to the pylon of the right hand engine. Which caused the right - [Narrator] In less than 10 and plunges into the sea. - Monsieur David, I have the - [Narrator] Investigators from XL Airways Flight what went wrong in the skies Information from a key - That's odd. - [Narrator] Part way through the flight, two critical sensors failed - We know there were descending here. But the sensors still show a climb. - [Narrator] Angle of attack sensors act like small weather veins During flight, they pivot. Their movement helps the flight computer monitor the position of the plane, so it can automatically to maintain lift. If the sensors got stuck in one position when they malfunctioned, it didn't detect the dangerous - We need to get a look at those sensors. - [Narrator] Investigators that allows the sensors to move. - Anything? - [Narrator] It's working perfectly. There seems to be no way to - Well, something jammed them. - [Narrator] David graphs altitudes, and corresponding air temperatures - Minus 50 at 32,000 feet. - [Narrator] At high altitudes, the air outside the This gives him an idea. - Can the sensors freeze? - [Narrator] If there was it might have frozen them in place. Investigators wonder if rainwater from a severe storm flooded It's a dead end. - The weather was nice that day. - [Narrator] The plane didn't If water got inside the sensors, it happened on the ground, not in the air. Investigators visit the hanger where the plane spent They learned the work replacing XL Airways colors with those of the Air New Zealand fleet, they noticed something else The plane needed extra cleaning after the paint job was done. - Tell me exactly how - [Narrator] Normally maintenance to remove any dust, but this time they rinse Spraying uncovered sensors might explain how water But the investigators need proof. There's one test they need They flood the sensors and recreate Flight 888. At low altitudes, the - So far, so good. - [Narrator] When the the temperature inside the - [David] There they go. - [Narrator] The water inside freezes, and the sensors stop working. The result explains didn't prevent the plane from stalling during the low speed test. - Get your power at idle. Adjust pitch, flaps full. - [Narrator] With the can't calculate the plane's Before the crash, XL Airways Flight 888, the Captain tries to fly out of trouble. He increases power while to bring the nose down. It's a textbook maneuver But it doesn't work. The plane continues to pitch up, until it loses lift Investigators need to know why. The flight plan calls for flying the plane through a series of 35 inflight tests that make up what's known - [Norbert] Okay, get your power at idle. - [Narrator] A computer analyze Flight 888's final flight check. - Okay, here we go. - [Narrator] Captain Kappel deliberately slows his plane down for the test. But the computer lets below the minimum needed to Investigators notice a warning on the cockpit flight display - [Daivd] There. What is that? - [Narrator] They learn that the warning is supposed to alert the pilots the flight computer is no It had switched to full manual mode. The warning comes on gets conflicting information. The frozen sensors are the plane is flying level, are relaying it's One must be wrong. - The plane gave the - [Narrator] It seems either didn't see, or didn't understand the warning being sent by the computer. - Stick forward. - The pilot uses his side - [Norbert] Stick forward. - [Narrator] In manual mode, The crew also needs to for a more dramatic change Investigators need to know failed to act quickly when They suspect one reason of this flight, an acceptance flight designed to test the plane's limits. - [Tower] Okay, that's good. During the turn, let's - Okay. - [Narrator] Every time - [Norbert] Hands off now. - [Narrator] The automation - Yep. Yes. Voila, it's all good. - [Narrator] Even when they - [Tower] We need to over speed. - You just wanna hear - [Narrator] They're expecting the plane to correct the problem. - There it is. You can cancel - They trusted their plane too much. - Stick forward. - Flaps up, flaps up. - [Narrator] With their plane the seven man aboard - Oh God. Oh God! - **** it! (wind whistling) - [Narrator] The official accident report highlights several contributing factors, including the decision to perform flight checks at low altitude. - Yeah, we need to go slow with recovery. - [Narrator] The report also calls for clearer rules governing and more training for stall recovery. January, 2009. US Airways Flight 1549 departs There are 150 passengers on board, bound for Charlotte, North Carolina. - The aircraft took off uneventfully. And very shortly after takeoff, they lost all engines - I caught something out And slightly to our right, but still ahead of us was a line of- - Birds. - And they were very, very close, too close for us to maneuver around. - Whoa. - [Narrator] After quickly Captain Sully Sullenberger, and realized that without engine power, they're not going to make - We're gonna be in the Hudson. Brace for impact. - You need to be aware In many, many accidents, the cabin crew are trying desperately into the brace position. But because the passengers haven't read the safety features card, they - Get your hands down, and stay down! - [Narrator] Proper brace feet flat on the floor, body bent as far forward as possible, with arms wrapped under the legs, or braced against the - Your body's gonna be thrown forward. So if you can get yourself the amount of movement back and forth is going to be reduced, and the level of injury will be less. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] In the cabin, the passengers prepare for the inevitable. - All the passengers really started kind of pulling together. And somebody yelled out - [Passenger] Be ready at the doors. - [Clay] The folks at the - [Narrator] Clay Pressley does He stays calm, and tries to think ahead. - So I started thinking I know I need to figure out If the water comes in, you need to be able to hold to get to those four or five rows, and get the doors open if you can. - [Narrator] But before anyone can escape, they must first survive (dramatic music) - Looked like the airplane was going right for the bottom of the Hudson River. Then the airplane popped up. And it was just sort of - [Narrator] In an instant, has become an unlikely boat It's now filling with freezing water. - That water was cold. That was very cold. And so your feet are freezing. - You land in the Hudson in the water is going to be very cold, and you're gonna suffer from Their feet and their hands will get numb. They're gonna be useless. - [Narrator] Passengers nearest - I just jumped up very quickly, and started making my way And so I worked my way out onto the wing, just a few steps to start with. - Fortunately, they had slide So what they were able to do, was evacuate passengers - In the end, all 150 passengers, and the entire crew of Flight Another example of how often end well. 10 passengers are flying - We were headed to Seattle. It was a beautiful day, it highly unusual, highly unusual. - [Narrator] In the cockpit, and his crew have noticed Not with the weather, - I noticed that the vibration that I was feeling in my feet, and the vibration that was I don't know. Moose, have a look. Would you? - Yeah. You bet. - As Gibson and Gary Lintner to report back, the vibrations - I distinctly remember looking down, and seeing my control yoke shaking. - Screw this. Let's turn around. - The engineer said, I and check number four engine, and see if you can see anything. And just as I looked out As the prop came off, I thought, oh crap. It's gonna kill me. It's gonna cut me in And then it came back, and then went underneath. - [Narrator] The prop tears a hole in the bottom of the plane. - I gotta go. - I grabbed a hold of the cargo net, and looked down at my foot. I'm looking straight down straight down to the ocean. - [Narrator] The gash in the fuselage has caused an explosive decompression. - Then, of course, the and there's almost no sound. Your ear drums are popping. It's a little disconcerting, You think, geez, am I dead or not? - Depending on what altitude you're at, and depending on how explosive you may have slightly But you will eventually - [Narrator] Junior Flight springs into action. - After the explosions, I But I got up, and got the oxygen walk - Jim and I got our mask on. And within seconds, Moose and said, holy crap, we just (dramatic music) - [Narrator] The rupture in the fuselage has damaged critical flight controls. The crew needs to descend where there's more oxygen. But the yolk is slow to respond. - Jim saw that the autopilot And he reached over and turned - [Narrator] The autopilot can - Wings level. - [Narrator] Steer the plane. - Descending to 10,000. - [Narrator] It's a struggle, but they finally get their Electra L-188 down to 10,000 feet. The passengers are no - It's now safe to remove your masks. - Well there's, of course, It just felt, it felt good. I think it was just surreal, - [Narrator] Reeve Aleutian The close call is a good that all cabin crews play. Michelle Santeurenne joined Air Moorea just three months ago. - I'll take the passenger list Ah, another full one. Just the way we like it. - [Narrator] Santeurenne flies with no co-pilot or - Okay.

Less than two minutes after takeoff, Flight 1121 crashes into the Pacific. (plane crashing) - [Waitress] Oh my God. (phone ringing) - [Narrator] The tower is - Is it floating, or has it gone under? - [Narrator] Local fishermen rush to help. But they find no survivors, only bodies. All 20 people on the flight are dead. (speaking in foreign language) - [Translator] I will always remember. It was terrible, because that despite what happened, people would come out (somber music) - [Narrator] The disaster in the tiny island community. The Air Moorea fleet is grounded when pilots refuse to fly the Twin Otter, until they know what caused the crash. - [Translator] A plane doesn't It was either due to pilot So before continuing to fly, we asked that the whole (dramatic music) - Bon jour. - [Narrator] Because Maria a team from Frances's the BEA is sent from Paris. It's their job to figure - Tell me there's more. - [Narrator] Alain Bouillard (speaking in foreign language) - [Translator] The Twin Otter It was used in all the difficult places, where other planes can't That made us wonder. What could have happened to this plane that would've made it hit the water? - [Narrator] Investigators usually rely on clues from the wreckage. - This tells us nothing. - [Narrator] But most of this plane is at the bottom of the ocean. Bouillard will have a little to go on, unless he can get vital - We are going to need a - [Narrator] There's another Unlike large airliners, to carry cockpit voice recorders. But Air Moorea installed one anyway. It could hold the answers - We were hoping to get, in addition to the voice in any kind of alarms that would sound. - [Narrator] But recovering off the coast of Moorea - Way too deep to send down divers. The sea depth of this area So obviously you cannot send any diver. You need to send a remote - [Narrator] Investigators equipped with a remote to assist in the recovery, the Ile De Re. There's just one catch. It's more than 2,400 miles away, off the island of New Caledonia. It could take weeks for Flight 1121's CVR is equipped or pinger. But the battery that powers - We would try to send that recovery ship as soon as possible, of the battery life of the pinger.

The pilots are just four (loud exploding) - We're losing an engine. We've lost number two. - Holding 7500 feet. - [Narrator] De Crespigny waste no time taking over control from the autopilot. 35 years of flying tells - Matt, ECAM actions. - On it. - The captain assigns Hicks He needs to evaluate every message, and figure out how best - Degraded pneumatics, Power to left wing shutdown, flaps, slats. And ailerons are damaged, but operable. - [Narrator] Captain De Crespigny knows he's running out of time. The failures are mounting. He needs to get the damaged That means turning around and - Singapore, Qantas 32. We require a left turn - Qantas 32, Singapore. - [Narrator] A heavy means any landing attempt The pilots decide to until they can work out a plan. - Dave, I need you to run - Check Captain Dave Evans - Three engines, full load, all that. - He uses the A380 landing how much runway they'll need to bring the huge plane to a stop. - Looks like we can do it, - Singapore approach, Qantas 32. We're gonna need a long approach, and better have fire services standing by. We're leaking fuel. - [Tower] Roger Qantas 32. You're cleared straight - [Narrator] The five seasoned pilots now use everything they've - Flaps, three. - [Narrator] To try to - Here we go. - [Narrator] De Crespigny's lined up with a runway - Singapore, what's the surface wind? - [Tower] 170 degrees at five knots. - [Narrator] If the there's no way the crippled plane can go around for another try. - Everybody ready?

Full brakes. - I am. My feet are flat to the floor. Keep it in, Rich. Hammer them. - [Narrator] Finally, after Qantas 32 comes to a it took off from, with less (calm music) (passengers clapping) - [Passenger] Hallelujah. (calm music) - Beautiful. Well. Welcome to Singapore, guys. - [Narrator] The future of the now depends on understanding what went wrong inside one single engine. - There's really only a very that produce the large engines, And Rolls Royce is up at I've never seen anything like. - [Narrator] Simon Grummett with the Australian - Everywhere you looked there was, there was shrapnel, debris, and holes in this thing. So it was quite significant. And that was the initial response. And from that point was gonna be a big investigation, - [Narrator] The severity of the damage adds pressure to find answers. - We knew that we had The next stage was to find out why the turbine disc had actually failed. - [Narrator] Investigators searching for anything that could explain the catastrophic failure (dramatic music) They discover something disturbing. - Oil fire. In a Roles Royce engine? - [Narrator] The inside of and covered with soot and oil. The evidence tells Grummett The engine must have suffered an oil leak. Grummett examines the engine further, searching for the source of that leak. - Kev'. I think we got it. - [Narrator] A narrow releasing oil into the area The broken part is called a stub pipe. - This nearly brought - [Narrator] Investigators send to it's manufacturer, Rolls Royce, where a disturbing discovery is made. One side of the pipe is That's what allowed it to break apart, spraying the engine with oil, and causing a near catastrophic fire. - That's no wonder it cracked. We're only talking, there was It's a couple of sheets of paper. - [Narrator] Investigators They learn why one side of the stub pipe was so dangerously thin. It was due to a manufacturing error. The ATSB immediately takes that their A380s are at risk. Just 29 days after the warning that a faulty that led to uncontained They advise airlines to (gentle music) There are 20 A380s with in service around the world. 34 engines are found to - As a result of this investigation, all engines that had have been removed from service. Rolls Royce have made significant changes to their quality management system. They introduced a software program, which basically removes in a similar event. (ominous music) - [Narrator] Perfect flying weather, everything is following (loud explosion booms) - What was that? - We have to get down. - We've lost pressure. (passengers shouting) - I saw a brilliant flash - Everything was going, was being sucked out of the plane. - [Narrator] Here's what's happened. An explosive decompression has torn away 375 square feet of the fuselage. - We were in a tremendous blast of wind. The wind blast was unbelievable. - A mass of things just Hair was up here. Everybody was in their (passenger shouting) I saw the stewardess get I could see her hair blowing but that's all I could see of her. - [Narrator] Jane Sato-Tomita at row two. Michelle Honda has been There's no sign at all of C.B. Lansing. - I will take control of power. - I can't hear you. - [Narrator] Only seconds have The wind noise makes it impossible for the flight crew to communicate. - What did we lose back there? - I can't hear you. - [Narrator] Now for the first time they gain a sense of what's happened. Visible over a mound of tangled debris there's blue sky where the The first five rows are now on both sides of the plane. (passengers shouting) The initial threat of since the airplane is now but passengers are still in danger. (passengers shouting) - My seatmate was flopping 'cause at that point it was just the floor and no walls or ceiling. And so I grabbed him. - [Narrator] The cold are both potentially deadly. - Just imagine the scene up there. The top of the airplane broken off, the passengers don't have any ability to get supplemental oxygen that feeds that oxygen is now gone. And at 24,000 feet with very the passengers become incapacitated. That's called hypoxia. If you stay up at that altitude for any prolonged period of time you become more and more With the top of the airplane gone, you now have 300 mile an hour That's three times hurricane force winds. Those people were dressed for not minus 50 degree temperatures. Any period of time at 24,000 feet and those people will die. (ominous music) - [Narrator] High above the Pacific Ocean an extraordinary drama is unfolding. (metal tearing away) An explosion at 24,000 bound for the Hawaiian island of Oahu tears 370 square feet of The Boeing 737 has become the best-selling commercial aircraft in aviation history. Over 10,000 737s have been sold. The accident airplane was number 152 off the production line The airplane was designed and 75,000 flights. This one had exceeded that number though many were of short duration. It's fuselage was under constant stress because of pressurization. - The fuselage of the airplane it expands and contracts When it's on the ground when it's at altitude, 24,000 feet, the fuselage expands so the that's pressurization. That will weaken the structure And given the history of this airplane being a very high cycle airplane, that probably had something to do with weakening the - [Narrator] With thousands of 737's taking to the skies every day, investigators need to be certain what made this one burst apart. In Washington, DC, Jim Wildey who worked the case. His expertise as a - I got a call about two in the morning, middle of the night, from my boss. And there had been an accident in Hawaii. They were putting a team together. I hopped on a plane and went to Hawaii. - [Narrator] He takes samples and back in the lab discovers to the naked eye. Hairline cracks like this between the holes where rivets had been. On the Aloha airplane, inside the overlapping joints. Here is the vital clue. - You can see now where the that was used to bond the two layers of the lap joint together. The white material you see of the aluminum fuselage skin. So the original intent was, the stress, that's trying to pull one skin away from the other skin piece, the stresses would go through the bonding and not through the rivets. Of course, as this now the rivets themselves are loaded and especially this top row of rivets, and this is the row of rivets we think that had the fatigue cracking in it that led to the eventual on the Aloha 737 airplane. - [Narrator] The Hawaii climate with humid and salt laden air helps But instead of grounding airplanes for a nose to tail examination, Aloha has inspectors make when those on duty are least alert. Working under artificial light, those tiny cracks escape detection. - These cracks go unrepaired and now you have an airplane - The witness saw cracking in this area and we found fatigue So this is the line where the One piece came down and the other piece went across the top and came off to the right side. - [Narrator] The crew realizes somewhere on the left wing. Their Airbus has become the first civilian aircraft casualty of the war. (radio personnel speaking - [Radio] Hey, Chris, did you just say there's an aircraft on fire? - [Narrator] This remarkable video was shot with the infrared of a US Apache attack helicopter. - Could you confirm if there's smoke coming from the aircraft or - I can still see smoke and flame coming from the left tip of the left wing. - [Operator] Okay, left - [Jet Pilot] That's affirmative. - [Operator] Thank you. - [Narrator] With no hydraulic power the crew has to crank open and let the wheels drop Cautiously, they managed to coax a bit more speed from the engines. - Let's land. (radio operator speaking foreign language) - Oscar, Oscar, Delta, Lima, Lima. Baghdad Tower can you make approach now? Runway is clear for landing. (plane roaring) - [Narrator] They're trying to keep the plane steady and descend all at the same time using nothing but the engines. - Airport is at 340. Now 320.

(missile fires) But in recent years, the shoulder launched anti-aircraft - There had been roughly 30 odd incidents of commercial aircraft being attacked by man portable surface to air missiles leading up to the DHL one. - [Narrator] What makes the so serious is that for the abandoned weapons leaving terrorists free to help themselves to millions of dollars worth of arms. There is widespread fear could soon be targeting all over the world. The US government's Department is spending over a hundred to adapt military counter for civilian airlines. - It is inevitable today will have to be fitted at some time with laser and infrared jamming systems. If you look at things like the president's aircraft in the USA, the king of Jordan's Terrorism is with us today and will always be with us It's impossible to defeat terrorism, but what is possible at a commercially acceptable level. If we don't do that, then (airplane engine whirring) (helicopter blades whirling) - [Narrator] The crash of this jumbo jet would normally be a but it's sent aviation alarm Only weeks earlier, an Air India 747 had killing 329 people. Now, another 520 are dead. Was there something wrong with the 747, the world's biggest jet? Could there be some unknown design fault? There were some 600 A problem with the plane would have grave Ron Schleede, the top investigator with America's National the NTSB, was assigned the case. - So it was very big concern on our part about whether there was an air worthiness problem. And so we had to jump on this very quickly to learn what happened. - [Narrator] At the Washington the chairman was extremely concerned of the potential consequences He wrote a personal note in Japan, asking him to invite the NTSB to join the investigation as guests. During the late '70s and '80s, with many international He's familiar with the sensitivities of working with foreign governments and heads to Tokyo where he'll meet with the rest of his team. Representatives from Boeing, the plane's manufacturer and an engineer from America's Federal - When I arrived in Tokyo, was extremely stressful. The news media were everywhere, there was a tremendous amount of anger. - [Narrator] Once in Japan, Japanese police had taken and we're treating it like a crime scene, diligently observing - Everyone was considered suspicious. Japanese airline were considered suspicious. They weren't even allowed (serene music) - Schleede had to wait for two days before the Japanese authorities would allow him to visit the site. - I was able to convince the Japanese to allow us to take with the stipulation stuck very close to us, and we supervised them they could not operate on their own. (helicopter blades whirling) - [Narrator] Schleede found the Japanese had quickly constructed helicopter landing pads. (helicopter blades whirling) - [Ron] It was an amazing sight and see what looked like at a distance, but you could not recognize any part of an airplane. - [Narrator] As the plane the air outside gets thinner and thinner, but the air inside the for the passenger's comfort. The difference in air pressure between the cabin on and the unpressurized tail on the other stretches the bulkhead and it's faulty repair In a test which duplicated to appear and lengthen (metal snapping) until the bulkheads snaps. In an instant, pressurized blows a 30 square foot hole bringing down the ceiling The highly pressurized air blasts it's way into the tail fin to the aircraft (airplane engine whirring) From that moment on the plane is doomed. The pilots don't know of their aircraft is missing, along with the crucial hydraulic lines that allow them to control the plane. (airplane engine whirring) It all finally makes sense. Without the stabilizing and with the loss of ability to control the rudder and flaps, the pilots cannot control the plane. The giant aircraft now called the phugoid cycle. (speaking in foreign language) - [Narrator] As the nose the plane gathers speed The nose rises again and until it loses speed, tips over and begins to fall again. The whole cycle repeats Flight 123 is now plunging up sometimes several hundred feet at a time. - It really could be considered a miracle that the pilots were able for 30 minutes or more after and their flight controls, and eventually worked its and it became impossible for them to land. There was no real except to fly as long as they could and hope for some miracle (flight crew speaking in foreign language) - [Narrator] To understand what four handpicked flight crews and confronted with the same situation. Not one of them could land the plane. The pilots of Flight 123 in the air for 30 minutes, much an amazing feat of flying. Back in Tokyo as the was identified, Ron Schleede to his colleague from Boeing, one of the top designers of the 747. The simple truth was that had been used for the repair - And when we described you can imagine this Boeing Personally was crying because that he designed and then the 'cause it was Boeing people that designed and did the repair, had that caused the airplane to crash. (airplane engines whirring) - [Narrator] Boeing's but if they could derive from this tragedy, it was that there was no inherent fault in the 747. The plane went on to become one of the most successful FedEx Flight 705 is several still climbing and passing Jim Tucker is hand flying the airplane, using control wheel steering mode and enjoying the clear afternoon skies.

It was the sense of we had been there and we came back and we won. - [Narrator] The crew of a coworker, but they're badly injured. Co-pilot Jim Tucker has bone chips driven into his brain. Flight Engineer Andy Peterson's life is in danger from massive blood loss. Both are in critical condition. The wounded men are rushed to the Regional Medical Center at Memphis. Restrained and under guard, Calloway is also taken to But the important question still remains. Why did Auburn Calloway The full story is beginning to unfold. Divorced in 1990, Auburn his ex-wife and their two children and wants to secure The evidence for a suicidal as investigators search the aircraft and find a letter to - [Auburn] Dear Pat, I want that I lived for you.

Sounds like the Montgomery's - I'll be right there. - [Narrator] When captain that Iranian gunboats are the Vincennes is well and destined for port in Bahrain. - Gulf Sierra, this is Vincennes. Request permission to against surface contacts, over. - [Narrator] Rogers asks his surface commander, for to support the Montgomery. But McKenna only authorizes him to send his helicopter to investigate. - Roger that, Vincennes out!

It was really my call. And yet, even though they they took it upon themselves to be there. I feel that maybe they - Jesus! This is Ocean Lord. Two, five, we have- - [Narrator] But once the Iranian gunboats fired on the Vincennes - Close Ocean Lord's - [Narrator] The rules of engagement now allow Captain Rogers He is now authorized to head off in hot pursuit of the gunboats, but where does that lead him? In 1990, Roger Charles obtains a copy of a restricted report on the by the International Civil It gives the Vincennes coordinates. When Charles plots them on a chart, he makes a startling discovery. At the time of the shoot down, the Vincennes is two and a half miles inside Iranian territorial waters. By chasing the gunboats back Rogers inadvertently places his ship directly in the flight (crew chattering) - If Rogers had not taken the Vincennes up to attack the gunboats, there would've been no I mean, that's clear. (crew chattering) - [Narrator] Up on the bridge, the crew has confirmed the kill. (crew chattering) The plane they believed was attacking them has been destroyed. Captain William Rogers thinks he has saved his ship from destruction. Nothing could be further from the truth. He's destroyed an Iranian passenger jet flying in an international air corridor. (dramatic music) The decisive factor in Captain are the reports he receives that the plane is descending towards him, - Altitude declining. - [Narrator] It's the crucial moment. The inquiry team presses tactical information - Okay, were you reporting descending elevations over the nat? - Over the internal nat, yes sir. - So in other words, that aircraft started descending? You were reporting that - Yes, sir. - [Narrator] Like an aircraft's black box, the Vincennes computers on the combat information center screens. Those records show that Iran Fogarty sends a medical team, to the Vincennes. They report that a condition could have played a part in the tragedy. - Range 13 miles! - [Narrator] Had those checked their monitors, they was not diving in a but was continuing it's steady climb. Yet, no one thought to do so. - Well, Scott, we have this disparity between what the data indicates said they saw at their various altitudes. Any idea why? - Sir, the disparity baffles me. I thought about this for many days now. And I came to the realization doesn't mean anything because I reacted to people I had operated When they reported at short range, they had decreasing I had no reason to doubt them. I had to make a to the commanding officer and I did. - So Lieutenant Commander and Captain Rogers trusts - My confidence in confirmed to me that the At nine miles, I felt I could no longer I granted firing permission. (alarm blaring) - Take order, track 4, 1, 3, 1. - [Narrator] The Vincennes sophisticated combat information system gives it's crew accurate information, but their fear has created a threat where none exists. The discovery of oil here in the 1960's was a shot in the arm Brent crude, as the oil is known, is a light sweet crude ideal and it's price is a benchmark in the international oil market.

Soon, several pieces of 56 but still not the vital Ed Trimble was the - But the big problem was to recover the tail rotor assembly. Without that, the investigation We knew that the tail rotor assembly had been dangling over as the helicopter ditched and had therefore detached at some point between the ditching and with the main wreckage. - [Narrator] Keeping the stay Ed Trimble calls his boss. - He was fairly skeptical of our chances. He asked what I thought our chances were of finding the tail rotor and I said 80%. To which he replied, I if you've got 10% chance of recovering the tail rotor - [Narrator] Ed Trimble relentlessly monitoring - I didn't wanna be in a situation where we would have missed any And in particular, any parts And the time, eight o'clock was coming. I decided to go down to and I couldn't have been away any more than maximum seven to 10 minutes. When I suddenly had these from our team. (crew members shouting excitedly) As I walked in, I ran in, of the screen was the whole And even at the first glance, I could see that one of showed clear evidence - [Narrator] The crew was right. The submarine's camera's on the tail rotor blade. A close look at the wreckage of the deck reveals the two of the main rotor blades were also struck by lightning. It's just after 1:00 AM The 217 people on board are waiting for takeoff. The flight's command pilot He has been with Egypt Air for 36 years. The command first officer He switched duty with another copilot so he could return home - Soon to be a married man. - Congratulation, Adel. - Thank you very much. - [Narrator] The airlines Captain Hatem Roushdy. Gamal El Batoty used to be an Eyptian Air Force flight instructor. He is now one of the oldest Just over 20 minutes after takeoff, El Batoty is about to leave his seat. Former National Transportation Greg Phillips became an expert - The relief first officer to come to the cockpit somewhere during the halfway or wherever he was comfortable, wherever the normal came into the cockpit about - Hello Jimmy, how are you? - How are you, sir? - What's new? - I slept, I swear. - Just wait, let me tell you something. I'm not going to sleep at all. I might come and sit for two hours- - I slept. I slept. - You mean you're not going - First Officer Anwar concedes and is ready to hand over to El Batoty.

At 20 past one in the morning, is going through his takeoff clearance with Air Traffic Control. Tonight Captain Rauof Noureldin and First Officer Gamal El They will take over after and fly the plane until Gamal El Batoty used to be an Egyptian Air Force flight instructor. He is now one of the oldest He is so much older that out of respect they call him captain. - Hello, Jimmy, how are you? - How are you, sir? - What's new? - I slept, I swear. - Just wait, let me tell you something. I'm not going to sleep at all. I might come and sit for two hours- - I slept, I slept. - You mean you're not going to get up? Look, if you want to sit - I'll go and get something to - Fine, fine, look here. - With that, El Batoty - Everything's under control. - Okay, chief. - Thanks, again. - First Officer Anwar concedes and is ready to hand over to El Batoty. Normally, this is the of a long flight for pilots (plane engines roaring) - Excuse me, while I take - Go ahead please. - Before it gets crowded, I'll be back to you. - [Narrator] Egypt Air's Flight 990 appears to be cruising But then, the plane dips, plunging down.

At the end of October, the are so cold that normally life expectancy is about five to six hours. At the crash site, only pieces are left. Within hours, authorities know there is little hope for survivors. - [Radio Operator] 593, this Please come in. - [Narrator] 310 Miles north air traffic controllers in Novo Kuznetsk wait for Flight 593 to radio that it's left their control areas. - [Radio Operator] Novo Please come in. - [Narrator] The recovery The Russian government police, investigators, and rescuers. Everyone in the aviation how a brand new state-of-the-art Airbus could fall out of the Does the A3-10 have They need to find out fast. Chief Accident Investigator The crash site itself offers few clues. The ones he does have are puzzling. Unbroken bottles of champagne, a flight attendant in an oxygen mask. And finally, the body of at The plane's digital flight data recorder indicates the engines were He rules out engine failure. Machinski needs the expertise of a man who knows the A3-10 well. Someone who can also and find out exactly what went wrong. (dramatic music) Vladimir Biriukov is an and crash investigator at the He's an expert on the A3-10 Airbus. (fist knocking) - Yeah, come. - I think you should - [Narrator] Each investigation begins with a complete analysis of the plane's cockpit voice recorder. This time it reveals something disturbing. - [Pilot] Now come and sit in - [Child] Daddy, can I turn this? - [Pilot] Yeah. - Kudrinsky was in the - According to the data. - [Child] Can I turn this a bit? - [Pilot] Yeah, if you where will the plane go? - [Child] Left. - Again. - Can I turn this a bit? - Yeah, but if you turn it to the left, where will the plane go? - 10 years ago, it wasn't unusual for people to be invited Of course, since 9/11, and you will find cockpit doors are locked generally - Every country sets it's own rules as to who has the authority In some countries it's up to the captain. So the captain can invite but to have them actually of an airplane, regardless of whether they the fact that this was allowed to occur is definitely an - [Child] Can I go back to my seat now? - [Narrator] The two by what they hear on the - It's so unbelievable. These two youngsters, the they were not thrown into They were his kids. - And they were flying the plane. - [Narrator] Captain Kudrinsky's children are about to pay him a Flight 593 is now over near the middle of Siberia. It's Eldar's turn at the wheel. He's been waiting a long Aldar finds the control but he can't make the plane turn because the autopilot - Is the plane turning? - [Narrator] Suddenly His father switches back to it's original setting, ending the turn and Eldar's - Why is it turning? - Is it turning by itself? - Yes, it is. - It's been just over three minutes since Aldar sat down in the pilot seat, the plane is tilting sharply, a turn that's getting The plane appears to be turning by itself, but no one seems to know why. - We've gone into a - Have we? - Well, of course we have. - [Narrator] An arc has replaced the straight direction line on the screen. The arc looks like a around an airport. And as they study the screen, It's now banked at 45 degrees, which is steeper than Suddenly, the command bars disappear from the primary flight display. The crew no longer has any information about course or heading. The plane is flying at 370 Like a quick turn in a sports car, the sudden movement of the aircraft begins to push everyone into their seats. - Guys? - The A3-10's autopilot works Suddenly, the nose pitches up, the increased G-Force makes it difficult for Piskaryov to reach the controls. He does his best, but nothing happens. Piskaryov's hard turn to the left has had no effect on the plane. - Call it, call the control. - Aldar is the only one with both hands fully on the controls. He can only follow the most basic orders. He can't get up because is pushing him back in his seat. - To the left. - To the left. - To the left, not to the right. - The other way! - I am turning it left. - Okay, get out. - [Narrator] Aldar has for just over four minutes. And now he can't leave. His body feels twice its normal weight. - Get out, get out. - Kudrinsky can do nothing but struggle against The aircraft is plunging and there's nothing anyone can do. (plane engine roaring) The first search party goes in the frozen rugged Siberian wilderness. They finally locate the on a wooded hill side, about It's soon clear there are no survivors among the 75 passengers and crew. This was a brand new aircraft fitted with the latest technology. What could have brought it down? Why was there no warning? Not even a distress signal. (gentle music) (airplane engine whirring) Ethiopian Airlines Flight from Addis Ababa to the Ivory Coast. The captain is Leul Abate. At 42, he's an extremely - 7,300 kilograms.

Everything was fine. - [Narrator] As the plane three young Ethiopian men All are in their mid-20s. The plane is bound for Nairobi, but it's not where these - We took off, everything was fine. The cabin crew called us. She asked if we want to have - Yeah, thank you. Coffee? Make it two. The plane is flying at 39,000 feet when the three young - I heard a noise at the back, pushing the air hostesses away. - There was some kind And I heard the cockpit door - [Narrator] Three men and arm themselves with and fire extinguisher. - Get out. Get out! - There were three guys, They came straight to the co-pilot and they started hitting him. &quot;Get up!&quot; - There's 11 of us. If you don't do what we say, we'll blow this plane out of the sky. - I told them, &quot;Okay, don't hurt him. I'll do whatever you want.&quot; - [Narrator] The hijackers - Fly to Australia. - What? - We don't have enough It's too far. We can go to Nairobi or Zanzibar or Dar Salaam and then refuel - [Narrator] In fact, the jet took off with just three and a But the hijackers don't know that. They've been reading which tells them the maximum - 11 hours. It won't take more than 10 - I don't have 10 hours of fuel. - It says 11 hours. - We don't carry that much fuel. We only carry what we need. - They thought I was bluffing. They were convinced that that airplane was able to fly to Australia. - Abate is shocked. No one else in the plane knows what the hijackers are demanding. If he does what they say, his If he doesn't, they say Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961, this $40 million aircraft The plane is out of fuel. A crash landing in the The loss of engine power starts As well as driving the the engines supply power and hydraulic systems. Without the engines, the computer screens, automatic pilot, and many other functions Although the engines are now useless, a low tech backup system allows the pilot to retain some control. The ram air turbine or RAT when all the engines fail. A small trap door automatically a small propeller pops out. The rushing air turns the generating just enough electrical power for basic flight instruments and controls, including airspeed. - Since it was powered off, that means there was no The controls were heavy. - [Narrator] The turbine for Abate to operate the flaps, which would help slow the Wherever he lands, Captain at a dangerously high speed. - Power off landing, power off ditching, nobody's trained in the world. Flying over the water, you I didn't have any of the instruments. - [Narrator] Without engines, can glide 11 and a half of altitude it loses. At 21,000 feet, the can travel for nearly 75 miles before it hits the ground. It's an extremely dangerous situation few pilots in the world have ever faced. In 1983, another 767 pilot found himself in a similar predicament. Air Canada Flight 143 ran out of fuel and landed on an abandoned air force base, sustaining only minor damage. In the right circumstances, a safe landing without power is possible. Captain Abate hopes to land at the airport in the Comoros Islands, but struggling against the he loses his bearings and - I was within the So I was keeping the airport Then through the struggle I lost where I was. - In the critical seconds it takes to find the airport again, and doesn't know if he A water landing is now his only option. Landing on the ocean than bringing a plane down on the ground. - [Bystander] Oh my God. - [Bystander 2] Oh no! - The ditching was terrible. The aircraft broke - In the end, of the 175 50 survive. Without the actions of Abate (ominous music) Tuesday, August 2nd, 2005, Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. Just a few minutes before Flight 358 powers into A regular flight from Paris to Toronto takes about eight hours. As Air France 358 closes in on Canda, there is little to separate At Toronto's International Airport, the thunderstorms are Rain, wind and lightning Just as Flight 358 closes in on Toronto, it's put into a holding pattern. The weather isn't getting any better. - [Toronto Tower] Air France - Toronto Tower, Air France 358, go ahead. - [Toronto Tower] You are Be advised, the proceeding aircraft reports braking action the surface winds near that's 15 to 20 knots. - Braking poor, 15 knots gusts to 20, Air France 358, thank you. - [Narrator] The crew is which will allow them Facing unpredictable the crew prepares for the landing. - Select auto brakes to medium. - Medium is set. Landing, auto pilot, auto thrust off. - [Narrator] At two Air France Flight 358 roars over the beginning of the runway, Then moments after touching down, still traveling at 90 miles per hour, Flight 358 runs out of room. (passengers screaming) (thunder rumbles) (sirens wailing) Emergency workers reach the burning jet just 52 seconds after it crashes. But with the threat of an explosion, it's dangerous to get too close. Some of the passengers stagger to the edge of the highway, where passing motorists stop As people are brought struggle to account for all Relatives wait desperately for any news. Finally, hours after the crash, passengers are reunited It takes hours to confirm, Air France and the local can make the incredible announcement. Remarkably, every single passenger and all the members of have managed to escape the (dramatic music) The next day, smoke and charred wreckage are all that remain of Canada's Transportation Safety Board quickly begins investigating the accident. - Landing, auto pilot, auto thrust off. - [Narrator] Rain and lightning had been pounding the Was it simply bad weather - Put it on, put it on. - [Narrator] Investigators discover that as the crew struggled on the ground, delicate the wind at the runway were With the ground equipment destroyed, they were relying on their onboard systems for information about wind conditions. But two planes had before the Air France The crews of those planes did their best to inform Air Traffic Control - [Toronto Tower] Air France - Toronto Tower, Air France 358, go ahead. - [Toronto Tower] You are Be advised, the preceding aircraft reports braking action is poor. And they estimate the as 290 degrees, at 15 to 20 knots. - Braking poor, 15 knots- - [Narrator] 23 mile an but are well within the allowable But when investigators study they discover quite a different story. As Flight 358 landed, a sharp line of rain moved across the runway it was driven by a sudden gust of wind of up to 38 miles per hour. The crew of the Air France jet that were much worse - Landing, autopilot, auto thrust off. - [Narrator] Blinded by rain, and landing on the shortest Flight 358 was in a dangerous position. But even in bad conditions, the crew had more than 9,800 feet in which to land their plane. It should have been enough. To find out why it wasn't, In 1999, an eerily similar accident took place in Little Rock, Arkansas. - I can't see it. - Way off. - [Narrator] Struggling the crew of an American only to have it skid off the runway. 11 people were killed. Greg Feith helped investigate that crash. In the Little Rock crash, Feith discovered that the crew which contributed Spoilers are only one of several ways pilots of passenger jets Reverse thrusters are used to redirect the engine power forward And sophisticated brakes To rule out any mechanical are examined by investigators One of the brakes on Flight but the seven other sets of brakes are all tested after the accident, all of them are working properly. Investigators in Toronto also discover that unlike in the Little Rock crash, this time the spoilers - Gear down, spoilers on, all green. - [Narrator] And when the reverse thrusters are deployed. No obvious mechanical fault can be found. June 24th, 1982, British Airways Flight 9 cruises through the sky over Indonesia. In a few hours, the plane are scheduled to land in Perth, Australia. As the jet flies over the city of Jakarta, it's cruising at more than 36,000 feet and has been in the air Captain Moody checks his weather radar. It shows smooth sailing - All right Roger, it's all clear. Just keep your eyes open, Just got to use the loo. - [Narrator] In the cockpit, the flight takes an unsettling turn. - St. Elmo's fire? - I don't think so. It's not - [Narrator] St. Elmo's that's sometimes seen when planes fly through highly charged thunderclouds. But there aren't supposed to - When did it start? - Well, just after you stepped out. - Anything on radar? - No, it's clear, not a cloud. Oh my Lord, look at engine four. It's lit up somehow. Captain, have a look at number one. It's the same on my side. - [Narrator] None of the crew had ever seen anything like this before, but the light show is just the beginning. Their bizarre flight is about to take a terrifying turn for the worst. The 747 is more than six Its engines appear to be burning. The 747 has plenty of fuel, yet somehow all four of the jet's engines have completely stopped working. - Roger, declare emergency. Mayday, mayday, mayday Speedbird 9. We have lost all four engines out of 370. Mayday, mayday, mayday Speedbird 9. We've lost all four engines out of- - [Narrator] With no engine power and no idea what has crippled their plane, British Airways Flight 9 - Jakarta control, Speedbird 9. We have lost all four - [Narrator] First officer but he has trouble getting - [Jakarta Control] Hi, - Jakarta control, Speedbird 9, we have lost all four engines, Now descending sending - [Jakarta Control] number four engine? - This idiot doesn't understand. Jakarta control, Speedbird 9, repeat, all four engines. Now descending through flight - [Narrator] Only when relays the mayday call do - Now descending through flight level 350. - [Jakarta Control] Speedbird understood, standing by. - [Narrator] As far as the crew knows, no 747 had ever lost power The crew has to find out While not built for gliding, a 747 can travel forward nine miles for every half mile it drops. With no power, Flight 9 has Some six miles above the ocean, the crew has less than half an hour before they smash into the sea. In the cockpit, the but also concerned that - Every time 'cause it's - [Narrator] The damage From the outside, the crew realizes that their windshield has They see bare metal showing through where the paint has and they still have no idea The engines were Their investigation is led by Malcolm Grayburn. - We did do a forensic And we did record it all in And also we did a lot - [Narrator] Grayburn were choked with fine dust, When it was closely studied, they learned that the debris Days after their harrowing flight, the passengers and crew learned that the night they were flying there had been a major eruption of the Mt. Galunggung volcano located just a hundred (somber music) Tom Casadevall is director and has studied the Galunggung volcano. - Indonesia is the world's most It has more than 130 meaning volcanoes which have erupted in the last several thousand years. Galunggung erupted explosively In April, May, June of 1982, the eruptions became - [Narrator] The night the volcano erupted again. (tense music) As the ash cloud rose more than Winds pushed it to the Southwest, right into the path of Never before had a volcanic cloud seriously affected an airplane. Could the ash have crippled this flight? - Roger, declare emergency. - Mayday, mayday, mayday Speedbird 9, we have lost all four engines. - Unlike ash that you or after a fire in a forest, this is not soft material at all. This is very fine, ground up particles of solid rock and minerals. This material is very, very abrasive. It's very angular in shape. If you were to see it under a microscope, you would see very sharp angles. And so that's what caused the abrasion. - [Narrator] In addition to and all the leading edges of the plane, could the ash cloud explain the passengers and crew had experienced? Early evening, June 2nd, 1983. Just before seven o'clock, the plane is a little more (breakers popping) - [Narrator] Three circuit Like fuses, they protect in the plane from becoming overloaded. In the cabin, one of about a disturbing odor. - Yeah, it is a strange smell. - [Narrator] A wisp of smoke It's two minutes past seven, just 11 minutes since the circuit Laura Kiama brings captain - Excuse me Captain, there's a fire in the washroom in the back. They just went back to go put it out. - You want me to go back? - Yeah, go. - [Narrator] A fire onboard an aircraft is one of the worst The plane is some six miles high. What starts as a spark can turn deadly in a few short minutes. But at the moment, Cameron doesn't know how bad the situation is. The crew is growing concerned. They've already moved passengers toward the front of the jet, as far as possible from Captain Donald Cameron from the back of the plane when suddenly, he's got a new problem. The master warning light is on. Electrical systems throughout the plane, including some in the Co-pilot Cloudie Met, is The washroom door handle He doesn't even risk opening it. Faced with a potential fire on board, the crew has no choice as soon as possible. As soon as the decision is made, another warning light goes on. They've just lost most Cameron finds that a isn't working properly. The horizontal stabilizer is frozen set for cruising Cameron uses the part that's to make the plane dive. But like a car that's lost power steering, the aircraft resists. As Cameron pushes on the controls, they push back with a Squinting through the smoke, the crew of Flight 797 lands hard. At 20 minutes after seven, the Air Canada plane is on the ground. It's less than 30 minutes since the first sign of any The cabin is pitch black and burning hot. Passengers who have found the exit slide off the wing and stumble to safety. The passengers who escaped the plane suffer from smoke inhalation but most are not badly hurt. What began as a simple electrical problem has taken the lives of 23 people. What caused the deadly fire? What went so horribly wrong? Investigators study all the on Flight 797 that weren't But they find no evidence of Investigators turn their attention to the cockpit voice recorder and the popping circuit breakers. - It's right there, I see it. Right there. - Yeah. - Like a machine gun. - Yeah, zap, zap, zap. - [Narrator] The circuit When they begin to overheat, cutting electrical current to the motor. It's a safety feature so the - Pops as I push it. - [Narrator] Investigators need to know if the breakers were tripped by a fire that had already started or was the motor itself the problem. The NTSB builds a mock-up and forces the flush motor to seize. They wanna see if it could The seized motor reaches a temperature of 802 degrees Fahrenheit. It's hot, but it's not enough to ignite parts of the (suspenseful music) As they listen to the investigators uncover a puzzling clue. Three minutes before the the recorder picked up another noise. It was the sound of electrical arcing, like static, repeated eight times. The noises weren't audible to the crew. Hidden from view on any Investigators focus on a cable coming from a generator Insulation had rubbed off two wires, making it possible for Sparks that could start a fire. In spite of countless and numerous tests, in the end, the NTSB can't pinpoint the There simply isn't enough evidence. Even if they'll never know investigators try to understand how it could cause so much damage. There had been heat and smoke, but no one had seen any flames until an explosion ripped through the jet. The fire had burned out of sight behind the washroom walls and the smoke, hot gases and fumes intensified and spread inside the wall space from the washroom through Those spaces acted as a sort of chimney for the gases and smoke Although the fire remained and ceiling panels, entered the cabin through every seam, gathering in the upper space in the cabin and pressing down on passengers. When the doors were opened an unlimited supply of oxygen was suddenly available to feed the fire. The more intense the heat, the more oxygen hungry a fire becomes. The gasses ignited with Every night, commercial this tall rocky outcrop to land at Guam's Hagatna Flights come from Just past midnight on August 6th, 1997, Korean Airlines Flight from Seoul, South Korea. Captain Park has navigated but this time there's a major difference. At airports around the world, pilots land with the an electronic system that If pilots follow the directions it guides them to the foot of the runway. The glide slope beacon at Guam airport has been removed for But impaired navigation is Captain Park is fighting exhaustion. As the plane flies closer to the ground, the crew expects they'll but the rain makes it (suspenseful music) - Isn't the glide slope working? - Wiper on. - [Narrator] Then a computerized It's the drone proximity warning system, which tells the crew they're But they still can't see the runway. (suspenseful music) - I've done this flight And when I estimated we're I bent down to put my shoes on. - 200. - [Narrator] The plane above the ground, but still They're quickly running out of time. - Let's make a missed Not in sight, missed approach. - Go around. - Go around, pull up. (ominous music) (cockpit warnings speaking indistinctly) (ominous music continues) - [Narrator] On a wooded hillside in Guam, the shattered plane (suspenseful music) It's not until the dawn finally comes that rescue workers can see The plane has spilled down the mountain and broken into several large pieces. Only 26 people survive the disaster. Blinded by rain and the crew of Korean Air Flight 801 thought they were heading When they realized something was wrong, it was too late. As the investigation continues, Feith and his team make Equipment that would've given the crew more time to react had The final accident investigation report is published more than It lays blame on the Korean and the crews over reliance But it also has sharp the body that regulates air Because of an FAA decision, a that could have saved Flight The minimum safe altitude is a standard piece of equipment But in Guam, the FAA had to the way it was used. MSAW uses radar to watch the planes as they come into the airport. If they're too low, a warning is given to air traffic controllers who can then relay it to the crew. But in Guam, the system kept giving nuisance - The controllers kept getting They redesigned the software and moved the limitations of MSAW further away from the airport where it afforded no one - [Narrator] Instead as they neared the airport, now tracked them when they over the ocean. - I think the best way to and should be irresponsible that was designed as not only for the controller, but you've taken the protection - [Narrator] For the passengers the lack of the MSAW If this system had been working, the crash could have been avoided. Without it, the crew (somber music) At Colorado Springs Municipal Airport, air traffic controller James Rayfield is ready to bring Flight 585 in. - The United 585 report - Got it? - Yep. - Airport in sight, United 585. - Lower landing gear. - United 585 is cleared for a Weather conditions, wind 320 - [Narrator] As its speed decreases, Flight 585 becomes more Aitsen and wants to know what other planes have - Any reports lately of any - Yes, ma'am. 500 feet at 50 knot loss, and a 150 feet gain at 20 knots. - [Narrator] Reine and their speed constant as they descend. - Wait, a 10 knot change here. - Yeah I know, awful lot of - Another 10 knot gain. - Free flaps. - [Narrator] As the aircraft the ride gets even bumpier. - Well.

(ominous music) - [Narrator] NTSB investigators examine over 2,000 aviation accidents a year. At times, by picking of fallen aircraft. While coroners mark the location NTSB investigators mark looking for clues to help them solve the mystery of Flight 585. (somber music) Like investigating a mass murder, it's a tough job walking Among the investigators is Malcolm Brenner, a His job will be to find out if the crash was caused by pilot error. - The area was cordoned off by police and there were Salvation Army trucks. I got a cup of coffee, a cup and I thanked them for it. And they said, no, no, thank you and they had this look in their eyes like, oh my God, you have to go into this site. - [Narrator] Clues to lie mangled in a deep black hole. The fuselage is crushed like an accordion in the impact crater. The rest of the plane is in pieces spread over an area smaller - There was a lot of fire damage. There'd been a fire afterwards, and it was all contained which just initial impression, it can be a sign that If there was a midair explosion or something came off the airplane, you would expect that to - [Narrator] The National begins a painstaking Engine turbines, the cockpit voice recorder are all carefully extracted from the site, photographed and sent - Brooklyn Center, Dynasty 006, we'll be carrying an emergency. We request a direct - Well, they cleared all the they gave him clear runway. So nobody was waiting, he didn't have to wait for anybody else. He went straight in for a landing. - Dynasty 006, Oakland You are free to descend - [Narrator] Captain Ho not the plane itself has His rear elevators, which of the plane don't seem to be working. Without them, landing his jet safely will be extremely difficult. - The problem is it's a very big airplane and it responds very, very slowly and you just might not do it You might hit the ocean. What you need is a very cool head. - [Narrator] Captain Ho must now land using varying amounts of engine thrust. It's a controlled fall towards the runway. - As we came in, we flew where I had lived, where And I looked down and If we don't make it down or because it's been so badly at least I got to see that. (tense music) (plane roaring) (passengers cheering) He made one of the best I mean, it was just perfect, touchdown. - Ladies and gentlemen, wishing you a safe journey. I hope you enjoyed our uneventful flight. Thank you for flying China Airlines, we hope you fly with us again. - [Narrator] The cockpit voice recorder is sent to Washington, but it's designed to tape None of what happened in the cockpit during the terrifying - Without a cockpit voice recorder, we had to reconstruct what the crew said and how they interpreted in the cockpit to the with the other data that - [Narrator] A record of the plane's instrument activity during the flight has been captured by the But again, the team runs into a problem. The flight data recorder experienced unprecedented stress during the dive. There were electrical interruptions too, which caused gaps in the recording. Investigators begin Passengers and crew report that just before the failure the plane flew through Had this caused the engine to fail? Satellite weather maps revealed that there was indeed heavy air but it wasn't severe enough The jet's four engines Even after the horrific they're found to be in working order. (ominous music) However, given the previous with engine four, it The wear on a small throttle It's worn down by only four but that's enough to restrict Investigators determined engine four did indeed deliver It's known as a hung engine. The aircraft log book had been written up on just the week before. But after weeks of that the engine didn't All the repairs were done a faulty engine was not And even with the loss of one engine, the plane shouldn't have A 747 is designed to fly The FAA, which regulates in the United States acted A new kind of transponder was The kind that might've helped recognize that a private A new system called Mode C to warn air traffic controllers. - Mode C Intruder is an automated program that is now incorporated in that if an aircraft should the controller will now be given thus giving him time to provide a timely warning to the pilot. - Commence check. - Seat belts, engine. - [Narrator] Even for the old strategy of see and Those limitations would be addressed with the most important innovation of all. - The major technological innovation that came out of the Cerritos mid air was the Congressional mandate operating within the United States would be outfitted with TCAS, Traffic Collision and Avoidance System. - [Narrator] John Andrews that developed TCAS. - The TCAS collision avoidance system, which was under development, quite possibly could have TCAS gives the pilot the traffic advisory 45 seconds before the potential collision. - Hey, Maria. Everything okay back there? - And then at approximately before the potential collision, is given to actually tell the to avoid the altitude - [Narrator] Today, commercial use TCAS. In Cerritos, a memorial garden now marks the day of the disaster. Mary Wong has since remarried, but the pain of returning home - There's nobody here, the house is empty. Derek was already living in And here I was, I was no and I was no longer a wife. And so it shattered my whole world. - [Narrator] Days after the disaster, Mary Wong met one of the few people who could fully understand her loss. - I went to the memorial service and it was very important to who had gone through this. And I knew from reading stories that Theresa had lost her And so I saw someone there - She says, are you Theresa Estrada? And I said, yes, I am. She says, And she says- - I said, I lost my - I just wanted to grab her and hug her because she was feeling - So, we had an immediate connection and we've maintained our - [Narrator] Everyone who flies today has been affected by the (sad music) The disaster led to historic improvements in aviation safety. Nilson Spotheimer was brought An expert in aerial navigation, he plots the plane's doomed final minutes. - My initial look at the showed a 7 degree bearing of the approach. - [Narrator] A small error when traveling at hundreds of miles an hour could quickly lead to an enormous problem. But why would the plane get off course at the end of the trip, showed no major navigation problems. In the wreckage of the Air Force flight, investigators discover an The plane's ADF, or Automatic It appears to be working, had been installed on this jet. To perform a proper a plane requires two ADFs. The device listens to the signals put out by the land based beacons, but it can only listen to one at a time. Flying with only one either to the outer or the inner beacon at the airport, but both beacons are needed - That would have on the aircraft, which the And only having one ADF to follow the approach accurately. - [Narrator] By quickly between the two beacons, to listen to two signals, but to an already difficult landing. The Air Force jet wasn't to land at this airport. - We're talking a very short time span on making the approach. It's gonna become rather to keep listening to the to search for your course and headings. - [Narrator] As he that IFO-21 took, Nilson's on an S-shaped curve It's the sort of path a plane would take when looking for a signal But just when the crew should be looking for the beacon signal, - About two or three miles for the seven, eight, nine miles, the flight track is perfectly straight. - [Narrator] Instead of that was in place, even the crew suddenly seems to give up. And Spotheimer thinks he knows why. Fighting heavy rain and hampered by a single direction finder, Spotheimer believes the crew called INS, Inertial Navigation but INS is an en-route navigation system and should not be used - An INS system uses gyroscopes of how much the airplane turns and banks. - [Narrator] After entering a at the beginning of a flight, an Inertial Navigation System tracks all the turns a plane makes. It's a self-contained but there is a potentially If the gyroscopes don't every single maneuver of the plane, the pilot can be off course. - (indistinct) I can't see through it. - [Narrator] The crew might have thought that switching to the system but in this case, it dangerously off course. Peter Golbrev is waiting at the airport with Croatia's prime minister. (rain pattering) - It was clear from my own flight in that this was a very marginal landing. I did not expect them to attempt The Croatian prime minister came up to me and pulled me aside, and he said, &quot;We've lost radio contact I got the State Department and he'd asked to to start search and rescue activities. - [Narrator] The search and rescue effort focuses on the approach to the airport. Perhaps the plane had - At the time I was about I was in Brindisi, Italy. We launched two of our MH-53 helicopters with special tactics air headed to Dubrovnik. - [Narrator] For hours, there is no sign of the missing aircraft. The weather conditions are getting worse. - Fog was in, thunderstorms - IFO-21, Dubrovnik approach, do you read? - [Narrator] IFO-21 has a CPI or a Crash Position Indicator on board. - IFO-21, do you read? - [Narrator] If the plane went down, the CPI should be sending out an ultra high frequency signal. But the Dubrovnik airport, does not have the equipment - IFO-21, Dubrovnik approach, do you read? IFO-21, do you read? IFO-21, do you read? - [Narrator] As the hours pass, poor visibility frustrates the searchers. - They arrived off the coast and they were over water - [Narrator] Hours after police respond to a tip. A local villager has seen something on the hill above his house. It's a long way from the coast where the search is concentrated. - We went up with two vehicles The weather was extremely horrible. Strong rain and thick fog. So we went on foot for about Then we came close. (somber music) - [Narrator] It's almost 7:30 at night, four and a half hours after the crew called for clearance to land. The crash of IFO-21 is finally confirmed. (sad music) The news races from Dubrovnik to America. - The crash site has been and I've just received word that there's also a Croatian - [Narrator] The tail section of IFO-21 that's left. Debris and bodies are (somber music) No one has survived the crash of IFO-21, The jet climbs through Without a moon to light the scene, it's hard for the passengers to see much of anything out their windows. In the cockpit, the simple is taking a bizarre twist. - See what the aircraft just did? - [Narrator] Captain Khadr doesn't like the way his plane is behaving. - Turning right, sir. - What? - Aircraft is turning right. - Turning right, how turning right? - [Narrator] The plane is on its way to Cairo. Instead, it's turning in - Okay, out. - [Narrator] The captain tries to get his plane back on course, but his situation just gets worse. (tense music) Knowing he's in trouble, the captain tells the first - Autopilot, autopilot. - [Narrator] But it doesn't work. The 737 is now flying almost (passengers screaming) The plane gains speed as it Just minutes after takeoff, diving toward the water, traveling at more than 430 miles an hour. (ominous music) Everyone on board can and gut wrenching turns. (tense music) The enormous G-forces for Captain Khadr Achraf Abdel Hamid, the third tells the captain to slow the plane down. (pilot shouting) The plane is traveling so fast, it's ready to tear itself apart. After flying almost upside beginning to bring their (passengers screaming) Then, they hear the They're getting dangerously (plane crashes) It's just before five in the morning, minutes after the plane it's disappeared from local radar screens. (somber music) By the time the sun rises, but there's little for rescuers to do. The plane shattered on impact. There are no survivors. All 148 people on board Moments before impact, the captain seemed to be back If there had been some why did it seem to disappear? (somber music) Some members of the team want to consider something besides mechanical - I think the major concern was that the human factors weren't thoroughly explored. - Perhaps the high esteem was getting in the way. - In Egypt, pilots are very respected and in particular Air Force For the past 26 years, has been a highly decorated In an environment like this, the pilot is somewhat immune to suspicion. When something goes wrong, the natural tendency is - [Narrator] And on this with thousands of hours of experience. Studying the flight data recorders again, the investigators discover Even before the plane's three things all seem to Instead of a smooth left turn, the plane begins to come The nose starts to rise decreases noticeably. But during this time, It seems that he's unaware of the changes to his flight path. - I've flown out of Sharm and in the same type of aircraft. And in no way should the to drop by as much as 30 knots or the bank angle to without clearly stating the reasons for the change in the flight path. - [Narrator] Some investigators consider a provocative theory that might explain this seemingly bizarre behavior. Perhaps Captain Khadr had - Vertigo is a physiological condition that would exist with any And it's based on the inner ear. Over a dark ocean without no ground lights, the to perceive visually whether he was flying up, down, left or right. And if the fluid in his inner ear was moving or he tilted his head, that may induce a sensation, that may cause the pilot to believe the airplane is flying straight and level when it's actually turning. - [Narrator] Egyptian investigators agree that captain Khadr may have suffered some form of disorientation After three hours in the air, everyone who didn't have bottled oxygen would have been unconscious. As it approached Athens, Flight The Greek Air Force scrambles fighter jets to investigate - [Fighter Pilot] Helios - [Narrator] But the pilots One of the jets flies closer to the 737. Someone is in the copilot seat but there's no sight The fighter pilot radios air - Athena ACC, there's of Helios 522. Helios non responsive Athena - [Narrator] He can see but none of them react to Then the pilot sees someone - Athena Control, there is one person moving in the cockpit of Helios 522. Repeat, there is one - Helios 522, do you read, over. Helios 522, over. Flight HCY 522, this radar - [Narrator] The F-16s but there's no response - One of them was actually behind the 737. The other one was nearby the cockpit and he was trying to communicate visually with the person in the cockpit. - [Narrator] Suddenly the 737 turns left and begins to quickly descend. - Athena ACC, Helios 522 turning sharply. Following down. - [Narrator] From nearly 33,000 feet, the plane drops towards the ground. - There is no structural there is no problem, obvious problem from the external view of the plane. - Helios 522, over, do you read? Helios 522, do you read? Over. - [Narrator] Then nearly The person in the captain seat acknowledges the fighter But no words are exchanged. Neither the fighter pilot can make radio contact with the jet. Just after 12 o'clock, almost three hours after it took off from Helios Flight 522 slams into the ground. (somber music) - Athena ACC, Helios 522 is down. Repeat, Helios 522 is down (somber music) - [Narrator] Fire and rescue there are no survivors. Most of the 121 victims are from Cyprus. The small island nation following the crash. After three hours in the air, everyone who didn't have bottled oxygen would have been unconscious. As it approached Athens, Flight - Most of the victims, they probably still had heartbeats when the airplane crashed, but almost certainly were - [Narrator] Hypoxia is no more But for Andreas Prodromou, the flight must have been a nightmare. As the F-16s roared to meet the jet and with his oxygen running out, he must've known that he Yet to the very end, he didn't give up. Prodromou made one last When he returns to the cockpit, who dreamed of becoming but no one can hear him. Probably because the radio the airport on Cyprus where Fighting hypoxia and struggling to control an airplane larger than Prodromou was in an impossible situation. Even if he could have landed Flight 522 was out of (sad music) (somber music) There are pictures of Andreas in Cyprus, in the cemetery where he are buried side by side. (father speaking in foreign language) - [Translator] As his father, Wherever I go, he's always there. (father speaking in foreign language) - [Translator] He left a very big gap. We will never get over it. (somber music)
