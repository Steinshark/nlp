&gt;&gt; Tonight on FRONTLINE, episode three of The epic story of the global meltdown continues. &gt;&gt; The American people are angry those banks &gt;&gt; Inside the politics of the financial crisis. &gt;&gt; Why do we not fire the CEO of some of these &gt;&gt; Taking on banks too big to fail. &gt;&gt; How can we not demand from the banks some &gt;&gt; There was almost two faces of Obama. Publicly he wanted to tell you that these to get them on board. &gt;&gt; Money, Power and Wall Street, episode three. Tonight on FRONTLINE. &gt;&gt; So much for that election day euphoria-- &gt;&gt; The economy has now lost 650,000 jobs just &gt;&gt; The inauguration was 76 days away. &gt;&gt; This was the most eventful and consequential &gt;&gt; --and all eyes are now on Barack Obama &gt;&gt; In Chicago, President-elect Barack Obama &gt;&gt; It's like watching a train wreck in slow &gt;&gt; --the S&amp;P 500 in an 11-year low. &gt;&gt; He had to start thinking about this the &gt;&gt; At the start of his presidential quest, economists. &gt;&gt; That team, for the most part, gathers around And who've you got? You've got Robert Reich, the liberal labor You've got Joe Stiglitz, who, of course, called And at the center of it, you've got all 6-foot-8 &gt;&gt; They had been advising him for months-- &gt;&gt; Obama at that moment gets a real glimpse Disaster is coming. &gt;&gt; And in those first weeks after the election, bad news. &gt;&gt; We were all worried about what we were We knew that the credit system was pretty a lot like seizure. &gt;&gt; Unemployment was nearly 7 percent and climbing. The stock market was down more than 6,000 &gt;&gt; There was a growing sense of calamity. This could be the most climactic economic were that close to a complete meltdown. &gt;&gt; At the end of the conversation, there's And I say to the then president-elect, &quot;Wow, that had to have been the worst economic almost a century.&quot; And the president says, &quot;That's not even my &gt;&gt; CitiGroup, which crumbled 26 percent today, &gt;&gt; Just then, overleveraged and filled with was failing. &gt;&gt; Every option from a merger to a possible &gt;&gt; CitiGroup stock fell 23 percent-- &gt;&gt; It's a very dynamic situation because the The Bush administration has left, or rapidly &quot;This is beyond our ken to manage. We're going to be out of here in January.&quot; Meanwhile, there's no one really to manage &gt;&gt; The federal government plans to pump billions &gt;&gt; The government rescued CitiGroup from the &gt;&gt; George W. Bush's treasury secretary, Henry out Wall Street's largest banks. And now during the transition, he would spend afloat. But it wouldn't stem the unfolding disaster. &gt;&gt; That period, when we go back and look at one of those periods where you look and go, &quot;What were they doing? Why did nothing happen? Why was there no political will to do anything?&quot; And the reason was very simple. There was nobody in charge. There really was nobody in charge. &gt;&gt; In Chicago, President-elect Obama faced to handle the crisis? &gt;&gt; The rumors were swirling. &quot;So who's going to be secretary of the treasury? Who's going to be the head of the NEC? Who's going to be what?&quot; &gt;&gt; The decision would be an early signal. Was the new president going to ally himself or those who wanted to rebuild it? &gt;&gt; There's people on the left who are saying a tough-on-Wall-Street regulator, someone who's going to take Wall Street to &gt;&gt; Paul Volcker is extremely close to Obama-- &gt;&gt; The left's first choice was Paul Volcker. &gt;&gt; --a kind of advisor-in-chief during this &gt;&gt; Feared on Wall Street, he was the reformers' Reserve chairman, a pro-regulation advocate, banks. &gt;&gt; Volcker was the main force for a historic for 30 years now, and interest rates have been declining for &gt;&gt; Picking Volcker would deliver on his campaign on Wall Street. But inside his transition team, there was the Clinton administration. They had their own candidate. &gt;&gt; You could not afford to have anybody but job with their hand on the wheel. Tim Geithner was the perfect person. &gt;&gt; Tim Geithner, the president of the New During the financial crisis, he had led the &gt;&gt; He's 47 years old. He looks like he's about 32. &gt;&gt; Extremely smart, extremely aware of this &gt;&gt; Geithner's career took off in the Clinton Robert Rubin. &gt;&gt; I knew that he was a protege of Bob Rubin. I knew that he was therefore of and by and He sees the economy, as a practical matter, And therefore, Tim Geithner is going to reflect &gt;&gt; And during the meltdown, he had engineered with letting Lehman go bankrupt, but then pushed for a more than $180 billion &gt;&gt; Tim Geithner thought that if they did not as distasteful as it was, that they would be jeopardizing the global &gt;&gt; He certainly talks now of having stared that that was not going to happen again on &gt;&gt; For Obama, adding Geithner, a key player unusual choice. But the two men had formed a personal connection &gt;&gt; The meeting was secret because they didn't might not be in the Obama cabinet. &gt;&gt; People tell me it was like-- men tell sight. And I got this from both sides. People close to Geithner said he was, quote, &gt;&gt; They were almost exactly the same age, &gt;&gt; Geithner is an Obama kind of guy. He's a no-drama guy himself. I mean, their personalities sort of meshed, &gt;&gt; They had an almost immediate mind meld. They'd both grown up partly abroad. They both had a parent who worked for the And they had a similar world-view. &gt;&gt; According to Geithner's official calendar, By now, the financial crisis that started &gt;&gt; On the trading floors, turmoil-- &gt;&gt; The global financial meltdown comes to &gt;&gt; Today's was the nightmare scenario-- &gt;&gt; We had a contagion that operated almost The panic from Lehman spreads to AIG, spreads Suddenly, Ireland is having problems. Suddenly, the Bank of England is bailing out Suddenly, Iceland is bankrupt. The govern-- the state of Iceland, it's bankrupt, Suddenly, China has gone from being one of a no-growth country in the flash of an eye. That's contagion. &gt;&gt; Wall Street will once again be keeping &gt;&gt; Back in Chicago, Obama had news he hoped Tim Geithner would be his treasury secretary. &gt;&gt; This is the guy who's going to be the point period since the Great Depression. &gt;&gt; Then another insider, former Clinton treasury chief economic advisor. &gt;&gt; Old hands from the Clinton era-- &gt;&gt; Obama called him one of the great economic &gt;&gt; Obama was always looking for establishment He was looking for establishment input, even sort of establishment affirmation. He definitely was a guy for whom credibility he cared about. &gt;&gt; Summers had been president of Harvard and &gt;&gt; Well, he was told that appointing this People will see it as reflecting the interests You're bringing in the same plumber that caused Why do we believe that they're going to be of the American people and not the interests &gt;&gt; But to Obama's team, the choice signaled &gt;&gt; I think the President's view was, &quot;I've are going to know what they're doing right &gt;&gt; Two-and-half months after he was elected-- &gt;&gt; It's the inauguration day of the nation's &gt;&gt; --the president and his economic team &gt;&gt; I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear-- &gt;&gt; Now the financial crisis was theirs. &gt;&gt; It's like you're moving into a new house flooded and there's gas in the kitchen, there's The question is, how do you make this house &gt;&gt; Next door at the Treasury Department, Tim He hadn't yet hired a staff. &gt;&gt; When you go to the Web site for Treasury position and it says, &quot;Vacant, vacant, vacant, vacant, vacant.&quot; They're still learning, like, which keys go And they're being asked to provide the plan &gt;&gt; One of Geithner's top deputies, Lee Sachs, &gt;&gt; Our piece of it was, &quot;How do you stabilize It was all about making sure that we stopped You need a functioning banking system to have And so we were charged with coming up with &gt;&gt; Just a few months before, Geithner had administration was spending billions of dollars save the banks. But it hadn't been enough, and the Obama White &gt;&gt; The White House tells Geithner, &quot;Look, We've got to tell the financial markets something.&quot; You know, &quot;Ready or not, you guys are going &gt;&gt; I know how much pressure the president do as much as possible, to get out there with some appreciation of of-- of direction. &gt;&gt; On February 9th, the president tried to He promised Geithner would deliver a plan &gt;&gt; Good evening, everybody. My secretary of the treasury, Tim Geithner, advisor, and others, are coming up with the best possible plan-- &gt;&gt; President Obama set a high level of expectations. The impression from watching that press conference &quot;Tomorrow, Secretary of Treasury Tim Geithner the world.&quot; &gt;&gt; Tomorrow, my treasury secretary, Tim Geithner, plans for how we are going to start loosening &gt;&gt; The White House announces that Tim Geithner's to present it. &gt;&gt; And I'm trying to avoid preempting my secretary I want all of you to show up at his press He's going to be terrific. &gt;&gt; The President said Tim Geithner is going to contain the magic bullet. &gt;&gt; But inside Treasury, Geithner wasn't ready. His speech was still not finished. And Larry Summers, the president's chief economic &gt;&gt; The moment of reckoning is coming, and And Summers writes back, &quot;Well, this doesn't use.&quot; You know, &quot;It sounds&quot;-- you know, &quot;It sounds It doesn't quite have the gravitas.&quot; You know, &quot;I don't think this is going to So they-- they get very nervous and they-- frantically reworking it. &gt;&gt; The next day, Secretary Geithner's time &gt;&gt; You have everything set up, a VIP audience, Markets are expecting something big, and they're So the secretary walks out, and frankly, looked And he comes to the podium and there are two &gt;&gt; Thanks to all of you for coming here today. &gt;&gt; He starts his speech, but he's just not And so his head's turning from one teleprompter going like this. &gt;&gt; Our plan will help restart the flow of It will help clean up and strengthen our banks-- &gt;&gt; At that point, Geithner had never given This was the country's first view of this the country from this crisis. &gt;&gt; Geithner was very inexperienced before, Before he became treasury secretary, had never &gt;&gt; Geithner looked like he was about 12 years He is not a good public speaker, and he just &gt;&gt; Geithner's plan centered on what he called &gt;&gt; This borrows a medical term. We want their balance sheets cleaner and stronger, a new program of capital support for those &gt;&gt; Under the stress test, the government would banks, and if necessary, bail out those that were &gt;&gt; They're going to go through and get some and it'll be a confidence-building exercise &gt;&gt; --too often added to public anxiety-- &gt;&gt; To many watching, however, Geithner's plan &gt;&gt; It's a pretty bad flop. Every cable network is showing the Dow just &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. Thank you for coming. &gt;&gt; He gives his speech, he turns and walks And you could tell even the VIPs, Ben Bernanke and everyone else, are, &quot;OK, There was a little bit of clapping, and it's &gt;&gt; The market responds by dropping almost Over 4 percent it drops that day. &gt;&gt; This is the guy who's going to be our secretary &gt;&gt; It did not go as well as anyone had hoped-- &gt;&gt; In the wake of Geithner's speech, the financial falling. &gt;&gt; The new treasury secretary-- &gt;&gt; Maybe he doesn't understand it well enough &gt;&gt; The markets reacted in a way that none Expectations got way out of control. We shouldn't have let that happen, frankly. &gt;&gt; They'd been in office three weeks. Already, Obama was being pressured to replace &gt;&gt; There was instantly chatter in Washington. &quot;How long would he last? Is he going to be the first one out the door? Is Obama going to have to find somebody else?&quot; &gt;&gt; People start saying that this guy is in for the job. &gt;&gt; Everybody's calling for blood, right? They want the sacrificial lamb, and it's going &gt;&gt; But in the Oval Office, Geithner mounted He stood by his strategy for stress tests. &gt;&gt; The guy people describe is a different And he was very convinced that this was the &gt;&gt; He was unflappable. If you think about what was going on in the the pressure that you can imagine, he didn't miss a beat. &gt;&gt; Geithner walked Obama through the details. &gt;&gt; The stress test, which is ultimately Geithner's of that idea that if you can just convince markets that these guys are going to be OK, case scenario suggests, then the panic will confidence will come back, prices of securities &gt;&gt; Critics doubted the stress tests would But for now, the president would stick with &gt;&gt; Obama couldn't back off of Tim Geithner You're in the honeymoon stage of an administration. You can't dump one of your guys. So he stands by Tim Geithner. &gt;&gt; The president stuck with the secretary. And he was under tremendous pressure to change I've got to believe that this decision was at that time. &gt;&gt; For months, there had been public anger The focus was CEOs like the chairman of Lehman &gt;&gt; You belong in jail! &gt;&gt; Growing backlash against Wall Street-- &gt;&gt; The frustration with the economy-- &gt;&gt; --anger from the U.S. public towards bankers-- &gt;&gt; And in cities across the nation, protests &gt;&gt; They got bailed out! We got sold out! &gt;&gt; In Chicago, Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis &gt;&gt; This is exactly the kind of story the Obama &gt;&gt; In Washington, outrage at Wall Street and And the anger was not just confined to the On Capitol Hill, Congress responded to the They summoned the heads of the nation's biggest &gt;&gt; Let me be frank. My constituents in Illinois are angry, and &gt;&gt; What did the banks do with the taxpayers' &gt;&gt; I cannot believe no one's prosecuted you &gt;&gt; It was chilling to watch that-- I mean, other. I think most Americans, when they saw that, That's where we're at. We have an industry that's just vilified to &gt;&gt; The whole thing, frankly, had a bit of hearing. There seemed to be a little bit of a contest of the neck and slap them around the most. &gt;&gt; As of matter of fact, Bank of America, just to accept our TARP money! &gt;&gt; I don't know what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; Bank of America's CEO, Ken Lewis, was in His bank had taken more than $45 billion in &gt;&gt; It was clear we were there to take a public I just tried to think of it that way and think just get through it. &gt;&gt; There's been wide speculation that some end up being nationalized. Do you feel that your bank should be considered &gt;&gt; Are you talking to me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Absolutely not. I don't know why you would ask the question. &gt;&gt; This was a grilling that lasted all day. &gt;&gt; Bank of America has to explain this to &gt;&gt; --comes on the heels of growing public infusions of taxpayer-- &gt;&gt; At the White House, the political team the anger would be aimed at the president. They wanted to make an example of one of the &gt;&gt; David Axelrod, Obama's top political advisor, Robert Gibbs, who was the press secretary scalps. And even Larry Summers thought there should And that was when the talk drifted toward, of America&quot;? &gt;&gt; Summers and the political team thought Lewis to lose his job. It would send the banks and the public a message-- would pay a price. &gt;&gt; Summers thought that maybe they needed bank, and that they needed to send a signal that, to consequences. &gt;&gt; Royal Bank of Scotland is almost twice You know what the British government did? They took it over and they fired the CEO. Guess what? When we had the problem with car dealers, the CEO. Why do we not fire the CEOs of some of these &gt;&gt; It would have been a bold step for Obama, it. He wasn't going to participate in what he &gt;&gt; Geithner didn't want to do it because it It would create this conception that the government in and mess with these banks and that that &gt;&gt; Geithner believed the banking system was &gt;&gt; This notion that the financial system was might hurt confidence-- it becomes very formative and very important He is very afraid to do anything to roil the It becomes this very delicate, &quot;Let's tiptoe &gt;&gt; He saw the banks as an ailing patient in He had taken to invoking the first principle &gt;&gt; The first rule is, to borrow from medicine And there were a lot of ideas out there, frankly, &gt;&gt; Geithner insisted now was not the time But inside the White House, he had a powerful &gt;&gt; The hard part about Larry Summers is, A, still acts in some cases, depending on who you talk to, like he's treasury &gt;&gt; Summers is very smart, very experienced, &gt;&gt; Summers, a highly regarded economist, believed Aggressive reform was necessary. &gt;&gt; He thought that there was perhaps trillions were going to need to do something really aggressive to solve that problem. &gt;&gt; Summers had a bold idea. &gt;&gt; He wants to restructure the major &quot;too &gt;&gt; Summers wanted to take on and break up &gt;&gt; Larry says, &quot;What if we don't bail out What if we restructure them? There's going to be blood on Wall Street, Wall Street won't exist the way it has existed &gt;&gt; Summers was concerned about &quot;too big to America, the new breed of super-banks. &gt;&gt; They bought and bought and bought, and another bank and get bigger and bigger and And even if they got bought by someone else, the show. &gt;&gt; But in the crisis, the banks were so large had to bail them out because their failure They are too big to fail. &gt;&gt; The financial system is too dependent on And therefore, the taxpayers-- we have, in to fail. &gt;&gt; And Summers now believed some of the too collapse. The time was right to do something dramatic &gt;&gt; His thought was, &quot;Well, we need to take of the banks, and A, that would set a good You know, Wall Street would see that if you with the country's fortune and you fail, you're going to get shut down, you're going to lose. That's supposed to be one of the basic lessons &gt;&gt; And Summers had a formidable ally, Christina as one of Obama's top advisors. &gt;&gt; But Geithner completely disagreed. He thought the banks were vulnerable and that &gt;&gt; If you're going to take over one of these off a-- down a hill. You have to make sure that you have enough all the way down. &gt;&gt; On March 15th, they all gathered with the &gt;&gt; It was an extraordinary meeting. It was literally a six-hour murder board in States, sometimes aided by Larry Summers, hardest questions, raising every criticism &gt;&gt; Summers and his allies argued that Geithner's &gt;&gt; The stress tests are a part of a confidence Many people in the administration, and out stresses that the system would be put through &gt;&gt; I was one who was critical of the stress to be tilted in a way that you'd get the result You know, it's not that hard to cook a stress better shape than you are. &gt;&gt; Geithner would not back down. &gt;&gt; Tim says the stress tests are enough. It's real action. Summers says, &quot;No it's not. It's watchful waiting.&quot; Tim is livid. &quot;It's not watchful waiting. It's not just waiting around. It's real.&quot; And Larry said, you know, &quot;What you're doing You need to pull off the Band-Aid.&quot; &gt;&gt; Hour after hour, in front of the president to Larry Summers. &gt;&gt; The secretary just kept methodically, but had laid out had the best chance of success least downside risk. And he just-- every time someone would raise it. &gt;&gt; Obama listened. Should they take on a major bank? Were Geithner's stress tests the best way For now, he'd keep his own counsel. &gt;&gt; For the economy, this is what freefall &gt;&gt; When will the recession end? &gt;&gt; Two weeks later, the nation's top bankers &gt;&gt; --after leveling some very harsh words &gt;&gt; The president wanted to talk to them. &gt;&gt; Looking for accountability from the nation's meeting with CEOs of some of the nation's-- &gt;&gt; Thirteen bankers were called into a room They were told that they were going to be for the president to vent the public's anger. &gt;&gt; The bankers feared they could be forced &quot;too big to fail,&quot; a limit on executive compensation, and a requirement that they refinance mortgages &gt;&gt; Walking into that meeting, these guys have school. They're ultimately powerful, sovereign men that they really could get whacked. &gt;&gt; No one knew what to expect, Summers's Old Now they'd find out what he thought. &gt;&gt; Obama comes in, and he's all business. &gt;&gt; There were few pleasantries exchanged. The president spoke first. &gt;&gt; The president made it pretty clear when &quot;We're between you and the pitchforks, guys. And you need to just acknowledge that.&quot; &gt;&gt; The bankers have essentially made a decision needs to be done to resolve this problem, to get the public back on the side of corporate &gt;&gt; But as the meeting progressed, to their was in no mood for confrontation. &gt;&gt; What's interesting is that the next statements Obama skinning back as fast as he can on that And he says right after that, &quot;What we have, that's turning into a political disaster. And I'm here to help.&quot; &gt;&gt; I interpreted it as a kind of a watershed Banks are the catalyst to get us out of this You can talk so long about the past, but at and the future. And I felt that's what he was saying. &gt;&gt; I think the president sees himself as a &quot;Let's get through this. Let's be pragmatic. Let's not shoot for the moon and miss. Let's accomplish as much as we can, but let's produce by taking this a little more cautiously.&quot; &gt;&gt; The president required no firm commitments &gt;&gt; I think it's clear it was an opportunity He had a room full of very frightened CEOs. He was in a position then to make demands, &gt;&gt; He didn't want to disturb the banks. He wanted them on their side so that things There would be basically business as usual. &gt;&gt; The president had decided. Geithner had prevailed. That day, there would be no aggressive action &gt;&gt; There was almost two faces of Obama. Publicly, he wanted to tell you that these But privately, when he was with the bankers, he wanted to get them on board. &gt;&gt; Good afternoon. I'm John Stumpf with Wells Fargo. &gt;&gt; The bankers made it clear the president &gt;&gt; We had a wonderful meeting today with the The basic message is we're all in this thing &gt;&gt; We're quite pleased with the cooperation White House. &gt;&gt; I think the bankers came out of that meeting that was what was required of the was to go stand before the cameras and speak as though president were on board, to make this great expression of confidence and reassurance. &gt;&gt; I believe all of us walked out of there And we're all looking forward to promoting Thank you. &gt;&gt; The already received more than $180 billion from &gt;&gt; No strings attached? I mean, everybody else -- home owners, everybody on Main Street, small businesses -- not only are they not able to get loans, but attached. How in good conscience, in good faith, can -- some conditions upon getting bailed out? That just seemed incredible. &gt;&gt; Unknown at that time, many of these banks from the Federal Reserve in order to keep daily operations from freezing up. It had started more than a year before, during &gt;&gt; Now we know that these banks were not successful. These banks were on the brink of failure. What we found out was that the biggest banks lot more money than anybody had imagined. &gt;&gt; The details of the loans became public the way to the Supreme Court. &gt;&gt; So what we found out, really, was that they were in much deeper trouble, than we On the peak day in 2008-- it was December $1.2 trillion. And that's one day. And out of that $1.2 trillion, not necessarily out $107 billion, had $107 billion in loans CitiGroup, over $99 billion on a single day. Bank of America, $91 billion on a single day. Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, all the biggest we ever thought. &gt;&gt; The loans were part of an unprecedented In all, the Federal Reserve made available in loans, commitments and guarantees to financial &gt;&gt; The data shows the Fed was lending not the world, and in amounts that were really &gt;&gt; Another big bank is in the black-- &gt;&gt; --people starting to get comfortable that &gt;&gt; But in that spring of 2009, in New York, banks. &gt;&gt; Bailed-out banks reporting billions in &gt;&gt; So should we be outraged or enthused? &gt;&gt; Just in time for Tim Geithner's stress &gt;&gt; They sent all these supervisors from the and to see if they have enough capital. &gt;&gt; It was a three-month process, all the bank fashion, digging into the books of each one &gt;&gt; The government today officially announces &gt;&gt; Today was report card day. &gt;&gt; By May 7th, the government was ready to &gt;&gt; Today we got the official findings. &gt;&gt; These actions today are going to bring clarity to the health of the nation's banking They're going to replace-- &gt;&gt; According to Geithner's stress tests, the healthy, and soon they would repay their loans. &gt;&gt; --the government's investments with private &gt;&gt; None of the 19 banks are at risk of insolvency. &gt;&gt; Tim Geithner feels like he saved the financial low cost. &gt;&gt; And Geithner took a victory lap. &gt;&gt; When those stress test results come in the White House, actually shows the president the reports, sort of his moment of, &quot;You see, I was right.&quot; &gt;&gt; The president and even some of Geithner's His position as secretary of treasury was &gt;&gt; Looking back, I actually think they were And if anything, the financial sector is highly I think the problem is that they're about now. And so that leads to, I think, very justifiable middle class enough. &gt;&gt; We're made as hell, and we're not going &gt;&gt; Hundreds of rallies in all 50 states today-- &gt;&gt; They came to vent their outrage in big &gt;&gt; August 2009. The Wall Street bail-outs stoked new anger &gt;&gt; Maximum individual liberty-- &gt;&gt; --runaway government spending-- &gt;&gt; They want to send a message to bailed-out &gt;&gt; The anger was over health care, taxes, &gt;&gt; There was a lot of anger, a lot of incredible The American people were angry to a person. They were just angry. &gt;&gt; No! No! No! &gt;&gt; Hard-working Americans all across this offended, to be frustrated by what they saw Those banks needed to be held accountable. &gt;&gt; Much of the anger was directed personally &gt;&gt; --at President Obama's stimulus package &gt;&gt; Obama's a Marxist, socialist-- &gt;&gt; We are the people and we have finally awoken, down this government! &gt;&gt; You work for us! You work for us! &gt;&gt; Fired up! Ready to go! Fired up! Ready to go! &gt;&gt; It was this new force in American politics. And the White House did not have a plan to It kind of caught them by surprise. And on the communications front, they were &gt;&gt; At the White House, chief of staff Rahm about the growing public anger for months, &gt;&gt; Rahm Emanuel, he recognized that you cannot the banking system without reassuring the American people that this is not going to &gt;&gt; Rahm Emanuel is quite forceful. Now, Emanuel's usually a guy favoring &quot;Do the time, Mr. President, for Old Testament &gt;&gt; Now the president decided to revive a central &gt;&gt; President Obama visits New York today to &gt;&gt; One year to the day after the fall of Lehman &gt;&gt; That September, on the one-year anniversary Wall Street to again make the case for reform. He would push for legislation to reform the &gt;&gt; --immediate action to reform financial &gt;&gt; We've seen bail-outs, stress tests, an &gt;&gt; He decides to have a meeting that's literally I mean, Federal Hall is-- you can walk down &gt;&gt; Washington's power brokers were there-- Paul Volcker. But many of the titans of Wall Street didn't &gt;&gt; Essentially, none of the big figures from They all-- they all just stay in their offices &gt;&gt; They don't even show up to the speech. Jamie Dimon and Lloyd Blankfein-- it wasn't like the speech was scheduled, you They just had better things to do that day. &gt;&gt; None of the bank CEOs had been fired or &gt;&gt; That's why we need strong rules of the risks that we've seen. &gt;&gt; Those who attend from Wall Street, you You know, they're talking about their summer Somehow, they have survived this disaster as usual. &gt;&gt; If you go have a speech on Wall Street up for your speech, and you're the president what more public display can you make to try And they apparently just felt like they could &gt;&gt; It's a very difficult day for Barack Obama. &gt;&gt; We will not go back to the days of reckless the heart of this crisis, where too many were motivated only by the appetite for quick kills &gt;&gt; Once everything's calmed down, once the have gone up again, once things seem stable, And there was no way for the White House to There was nothing that the White House could &gt;&gt; Fifty-two percent of the American people the economy-- &gt;&gt; --rising doubt about his approach on domestic &gt;&gt; Back in Washington, the president's efforts with another priority - healthcare reform. &gt;&gt; Between the economy and health care reform, &gt;&gt; You're tied down in this disaster of a All the energy of the political people in campaign. &gt;&gt; There was no interest, no incentive inside to the banking system before health care was &gt;&gt; As the health care debate heated up, reforming &gt;&gt; The problem was the timing. It was 2010. And by 2010, the banks had recovered. They were much more aggressive.
