&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Tonight-- &gt;&gt; The race to become an A.I. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The politics of &gt;&gt; There will be and there will be &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The new tech war. &gt;&gt; The more data, So in the age of A.I., China is the new Saudi Arabia. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: &gt;&gt; When I increase productivity jobs go away. &gt;&gt; I believe about 50% of jobs or extremely threatened by A.I. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: A.I. and corporate &gt;&gt; We thought that we were We had no idea that Google &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And the threat &gt;&gt; China is on its way a total surveillance state. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Tonight on &gt;&gt; It has pervaded so many How do we make it transparent &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: This is the world's There are more possible moves than there are atoms Legend has it that in 2300 BCE, to teach his son discipline, And, over 4,000 years later, would signal the start It was 2016, in Seoul, &gt;&gt; Can machines overtake A breakthrough moment when the of the Asian board game Go developed by Google. &gt;&gt; (speaking Korean): &gt;&gt; In countries where like China and Japan and, Go is not just a game, right? It's, like, how you learn It has an almost spiritual You know, if you talk and Lee Sedol is the world's he's a national hero They were sure that Lee Sedol &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Google's AlphaGo starting with the rules of Go and a database had been designed &gt;&gt; I was one of the commentators And yes, it was watched by tens (man speaking Korean) &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Throughout this was seen as with national pride at stake. &gt;&gt; Wow, that was a player guess. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But much more This was the public unveiling of a form of artificial called deep learning, that mimics the neural networks &gt;&gt; So what happens with machine or artificial intelligence-- is that the machine is fed and then it studies them, and figures out its own moves. And because it's an A.I. it's not just following it's figuring out its own it comes up with moves that So, it studies games that humans and then it comes up (woman speaking Korean) (speaking Korean): &gt;&gt; That's a very... &gt;&gt; I thought it was a mistake. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Game two, move 37. &gt;&gt; That move 37 was a move that but yet it ended up being and woke people up to say, &quot;Wow, after thousands we never thought about making &gt;&gt; Oh, he resigned. It looks like... Lee Sedol has &gt;&gt; Yeah! &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In the end, the their algorithms win four Lee Sedol took one. &gt;&gt; What happened with Go, was a huge victory for deep mind It wasn't that the computers it was that, you know, one type &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Artificial it could marshal a vast amount beyond anything any human and use it to teach itself how The commercial implications &gt;&gt; While AlphaGo is a, but its success and its waking is, is going to be remembered where A.I. became mature and everybody jumped &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: This is about the (man speaking local language) How the A.I. algorithms are of great potential and but an age that will also deepen and divide the world Tonight, five stories about how is changing our world. China has decided to chase &gt;&gt; The difference between and the A.I. mindset... &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: A future made and &gt;&gt; Well, it's hard not to feel and also the obvious fact They're mostly very younger so that this clearly is generated by a whole new &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Orville Schell America's foremost &gt;&gt; (speaking Mandarin) &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He first came here &gt;&gt; When I, when I first came Chairman Mao was still alive, the Cultural Revolution and there wasn't a single whiff of what you see here. It was unimaginable. In fact, in those years, &quot;This is the way China is, this And the fact that it has gone so many different changes since (man giving instructions) &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: This extraordinary to that game of Go. &gt;&gt; I think that the government that this was a sort of critical and, &quot;We need to catch up &quot;We cannot have a foreign at our own game. And this is going to be critically important So, you know, we called it the for the Chinese government-- the Chinese government kind of &gt;&gt; (translated): As we often say &quot;The beginning is the most &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In 2017, Xi Jinping the government's bold new plans to an audience China would catch up with the by 2025 and lead the world &gt;&gt; (translated): ...and in frontier areas such as artificial intelligence, and accounting computing. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Today, China leads Drones deliver to rural And a society that bypassed now shops in stores where the currency &gt;&gt; No country has ever moved And in a short two-and-a-half China's A.I. implementation to probably about that is billion-dollar And that, that progress is, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The progress was of ambitious young techs pouring competing with each other and financed by a new cadre of This is Sinovation, created by U.S.-educated A.I. Kai-Fu Lee. &gt;&gt; These unicorns-- we've got six, in the general A.I. area. And unicorn means a a company whose valuation is at $1 billion or higher. I think we put two unicorns &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Kai-Fu Lee was born His parents sent him His PhD thesis was on computer speech which took him to Apple. &gt;&gt; Well, reality is a step with Apple Computers' &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And at 31, &gt;&gt; Kai-Fu Lee, speech-recognition technology. &gt;&gt; Casper, copy this Casper, paste. Casper, 72-point italic outline. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He would move on to and became the head Ten years ago, he started and began looking for promising &gt;&gt; So, the Chinese started as copycats. But over the last 15 years, of entrepreneurship, and that as tenacious, very fast, and incredible work ethic. I would say these few thousand they could take on any anywhere in the world. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Entrepreneurs like the 33-year-old C.E.O. of This is a ring road around The car is driving itself. &gt;&gt; You see, another cutting, &gt;&gt; Another cut-in, yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Cao has no doubt of autonomous vehicles. &gt;&gt; Just like AlphaGo can beat I think the machine will the human driver, in the end. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Recently, there about how soon autonomous but Cao and his team are they're in for the long haul. &gt;&gt; U.S. will be the first but China may be the first It is 50-50 right now. U.S. is ahead in technology. China has a larger market, is helping with infrastructure for example, building a new city with autonomous driving enabled, and also a new highway that has to help autonomous vehicle &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Their early Mercedes-Benz. &gt;&gt; I feel very lucky and very and very exciting that we're &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Life in China is on smartphones. A billion people use WeChat, Messenger, and PayPal, combined into just one And there are many more. &gt;&gt; China is the best place because the vast amount of data China has a lot more users than three to four times more than There are 50 times more mobile There are ten times more food which serve as data to learn than the U.S. 300 times more shared bicycle and each shared bicycle ride submitting data up to the cloud. We're talking about maybe ten and A.I. is basically run on The more data, the better more importantly than how working on the problem. So, in the age of A.I., China is the new Saudi Arabia. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And access to all means that the deep-learning behavior, like the wanting a short-term loan. &gt;&gt; Here is our application. And customer can choose how many and how long they want and they can input And after, after that, you can &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The C.E.O. shows us &gt;&gt; It is, it has done. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It takes an average &gt;&gt; It has passed to banks. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: the algorithm has assessed from all your data. &gt;&gt; 5,000 features that is when maybe the banks only use when they are doing &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Processing millions it'll dig up features that would to a human loan officer, your loan application, if you keep your cell phone &gt;&gt; It's very interesting, the is related with their Someone who has much more they get much more dangerous &gt;&gt; It's probably unfathomable how a country can dramatically from a copycat laggard to, to nearly as good as the U.S. in &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Like this he invested in. Megvii was started by three It's now a world leader in using &gt;&gt; It's pretty fast. For example, we have timed the It's actually less So, that's very, very fast. So 0.1 second that we can, we even on a mobile device. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The company claims than any human at identifying And for those who aren't, Like our director-- and a good guess at his age, &gt;&gt; We are the first one to to commercial quality. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: That's why in you can pay for your KFC &gt;&gt; You know, it's not so we've seen Chinese companies in technology for a long time. And so, if particular effort in a specific sector, that they would surpass And facial recognition is one of we've seen that start to happen. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It's a technology like this program in Shenzhen Offenders are shamed in public-- can be instantly fined. Critics warn that the government have been building a national from dozens of experimental &gt;&gt; The government wants to all these individual behaviors, into some kind of metrics and or set of number associated a citizen, and using that, or punishment system. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: A high can be rewarded with discounts A low number can lead Some say it's very popular that wants to punish Others see a future that rewards and silences criticism. &gt;&gt; Right now, there is no final And from those experiments, we of what this social-credit It's very powerful-- and it's extremely troublesome &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Every evening ever-present cameras record the as they surge down to the Bund, the promenade along the banks Once the great trading houses of with the Middle Kingdom. In the last century, by Mao's revolution. But now, in the age of A.I., people come here to take that reflects China's (spectators gasp) And illuminates the great taken root &gt;&gt; People have called it authoritarian capitalism. We are watching a kind in which an experiment of, you to the world is Whether you can combine these and get something that's coherent, Whether you can bring together with an innovative sector, and technologically innovative, and that's something we thought &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: it has set its sights in artificial intelligence But that means taking on the A.I. culture. On an interstate artificial intelligence is at that's become emblematic replacing a human driver. This is the company's C.E.O., &gt;&gt; The more things we build the less people ask questions about how old you are when you &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And this is what Commercial goods are being to Arizona on Interstate 10. There is a driver in the cab, It's a path set by a C.E.O. &gt;&gt; Are we ready, Henry? The aim is to score these pucks So I, I did competitive robotics and I took it very, very To, to give you a sense, I won for the first time I've been to worlds seven times between the ages of 13 I eventually founded a team, did a lot of work at a Things looking pretty good. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: This was a from which he has built his &gt;&gt; I hadn't built a robot in a and felt that this was by far of robotics technology that was A lot of people told us we But knew roughly the techniques And I was pretty confident that you would get something Took the summer off, built in my that could drive itself. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: That golf cart of Silicon Valley, of venture capital. He formed a team and then was in self-driving trucks. He says there's also &gt;&gt; If we can build a truck than a human driver, then not When we talk to regulators, everyone agrees that the only to zero highway deaths, is to use self-driving. And so, I'm sure you've heard more than 90% of all crashes have a human driver So if you want to solve which, in my opinion, are the that happens year after year this is the only solution. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: but only possible because in deep learning. &gt;&gt; Artificial intelligence is that has made it possible now where it wasn't possible particularly in the ability A lot of people don't know this, for computers, to do even the most basic like seeing a picture and knowing that it's a person. And we've made gigantic strides in being able to see and and that's obviously fundamental the world around you that you have available. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: That's now possible because of the algorithms and a small group of scientists. &gt;&gt; There are many aspects which we can't explain And that part of our knowledge probably the majority of it. So, like, the stuff we can is the tip of the iceberg. And so to get at the bottom of the computers have to acquire from data, from examples. Just like children learn, but from interacting and playing around, and, and and seeing what works &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: This is an early In 2013, deep-mind scientists on the Atari video game The computer was only told After 100 games, it learned to to hit the ball and break After 300, it could do that After 500 games, it came up with by digging a tunnel on the side and sending the ball to break many bricks That was deep learning. &gt;&gt; That's the A.I. program based really, that has been in the last few years and has... It wasn't clear ten years ago but it has completely changed and is now used in almost &gt;&gt; Even the best and brightest we just don't have enough inside of our heads. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Amy Webb is a and founder of the Future Today &gt;&gt; As A.I. progresses, the great they, these, these machines, are able to think and imagine in ways that we never have which means that maybe we have weird, seemingly implausible Maybe we have some radically to dealing with The real practical and wonderful be more creative, and, we get to terrific solutions. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Solutions that to urgent problems. &gt;&gt; It's going to change Right now, 40,000 women die from breast cancer &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Dr. Connie Lehman of the breast imaging center at Massachusetts General &gt;&gt; We've become so complacent we almost don't think it can We, we somehow think we should into chemotherapies with metastatic breast cancer, and yet, you know, when we find and we cure it without having when we diagnose it late. This shows the progression of a to the next, of the small cancer here. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: This is what who had been diagnosed started to ask questions about why it couldn't have been &gt;&gt; It really brings a lot of and you're asking the questions, &quot;Am I going to survive? What's going to happen And I start asking &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: She was used to At M.I.T.'s Professor Regina Barzilay uses to teach the computer to as well as read text and data. &gt;&gt; I was really surprised that I ask my physicians, which were really excellent they couldn't give me answers &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: She was convinced from mammograms the computer could predict &gt;&gt; If we fast-forward from 2012 we then see when Regina because of this spot on her Is it possible, with more that we might have identified or even back here? &gt;&gt; So, those are standard in machine learning-- there is And to my big surprise, that we are developing even in the most simple form, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Regina and Connie of getting access to thousands from MGH's breast-imaging &gt;&gt; So, our first foray was just we had at MGH during who had had breast surgery of high-risk lesion. And we found that most of them They didn't have cancer. But about ten percent With Regina's techniques and machine learning, we were that truly needed the surgery those that really could avoid &gt;&gt; What machine can do, it can of images where the outcome and learn, based on how, you what are the very unique with future occurrence So, instead of using human to kind of recognize pattern, which is inherently limited and how much we can see we're providing machine with a and make it learn &gt;&gt; So, we are using technology at assessing the breast density, but to get more to the point of &quot;Does this woman have and will she develop a cancer And that's, again, where machine and deep learning can and our patients. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In the age of A.I., the algorithms are transporting of vast potential and of human endeavor and Andrew McAfee is a research who co-authored &gt;&gt; The great compliment that a &quot;Gosh, I wish I had written The great compliment a geek &quot;Wow, I wish I had drawn So, I wish I had drawn &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: to show human development and &gt;&gt; The state of human is not very advanced, and it's very quickly at all, and thousands of years. When we, when we formed empires when we tried democracy, and mathematics and fundamental big deal. It just, the numbers don't What's weird is that the numbers of an eye at one point in time. And it goes from really uninteresting, to, holy Toledo, And then the question is, to cause that change? And the answer There were other things that but really what fundamentally we overcame the limitations Something equally interesting is We are overcoming the We're not getting rid of them, we're not making them but, holy cow, can we leverage You have to be a huge pessimist not to find that profoundly &gt;&gt; I really do think the world Artificial intelligence holds so but it's going to reshape every so many aspects of our lives. Because A.I. is a little bit Everybody's going to use it. Every company is going to be integrating it into governments are going to be nonprofit organizations are It's going to create all kinds in ways large and small, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The challenges, the autonomous truck as it maneuvers The engineers are confident about when this will happen, they can get it working safely than most people realize. &gt;&gt; I think that you will see the with no one inside them moving and then you're going to see more geographies, as that capability builds up. We're talking, like, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He already has a as a client, shipping appliances He says the sales pitch &gt;&gt; They spend hundreds of shipping parts around We can bring that cost in half. And they're really excited to be both because of the potential, the potential savings from and also because of all the that they see, the biggest one 24 hours a day. So, right now, human drivers are by federal law, obviously wouldn't have &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The idea of a in discussions about artificial Steve Viscelli is a sociologist while researching his book &quot;The &gt;&gt; This is one of the most in, in U.S. labor history, is, you know, the decline of, The industry was deregulated and at that time, you know, the equivalent of over And today the typical truck a little over $40,000 a year. And I think it's of the automation story, right? Why are they so afraid of Because we've had four decades And if anybody is going to take from automation the, the first in line is going without a doubt. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: For his research, and their families, of Beaverton, Michigan. &gt;&gt; Hey, Hope, &gt;&gt; Hi, Steve, nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; Great to meet you, too, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And their son &gt;&gt; This is Daddy, me, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But Daddy's not Shawn Cumbee's truck has broken Hope, who drove a truck herself, &gt;&gt; We made $150,000, right, That sounds great, right? That's, like, good money. We paid $100,000 in fuel, okay? So, right there, But I didn't really, because, you get an oil change every so that's $300 a month. You still have to do We had a motor blow out, right? $13,000. Right? I know, I mean, I choke up a because it was... And it was 13,000, and we were So, by the end of the year, by the end of the year, About $22,000. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In a truck stop Shawn has been sidelined The garage owner is letting him &gt;&gt; Hi, baby. &gt;&gt; (on phone): Hey, how's it &gt;&gt; It's going. &gt;&gt; Hi, Daddy! What're you doing? &gt;&gt; Believe it or not, I mean, you know, Third-generation driver. And my granddaddy told me a long when I was probably he said, &quot;The world meets nobody Nobody.&quot; He said, &quot;If you want it, And that's what I do every day. I live by that creed. And I've lived by that &gt;&gt; So, if you're down for a week you still have to pay your I have enough money in my to pay a month's worth of bills. That does not include my food. That doesn't include field trips My son and I just went to our I took, I took money out of my because it's not... It's, it's not something that I mean, like, when... (sighs): Sorry. &gt;&gt; It's okay. Have you guys ever talked about Is he... &gt;&gt; (laughing): So, kind of. Um, I asked him once, you know. And he laughed so hard. He said, &quot;No way will they that can drive itself.&quot; &gt;&gt; It's kind of interesting when they're putting all this new but, you know, And man, you know, I really don't see it being 'cause, one, you still got to because I don't see it I don't see it doing, I don't see it backing into I don't see the automation part, maybe the box-trailer side, but not stuff like I do. So, I ain't really worried about &gt;&gt; How near of a future is it? &gt;&gt; Yeah, self-driving, um... So, some, you know, some Embark, for instance, is one driverless trucks And what's called exit-to-exit And they're currently running &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; (on P.A.): Shower guest 100, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Over time, it has for veteran independent drivers to make a living. They've been replaced by less experienced drivers. &gt;&gt; So, the, the trucking and, again, in, in many labor's a third of that cost. By my estimate, I, you know, of 300,000 or so jobs that could be automated to some &gt;&gt; (groans) &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The A.I. future out here in the West. In 2018, many of the people gathered in San Francisco to of the industry magazine. &gt;&gt; Howdy, welcome to WIRED25. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It is a but there's also a growing sense and even skepticism. &gt;&gt; We're having a really good &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Nick Thompson is &gt;&gt; When it started, about what's coming and why you Optimism was the defining for many, many years. Or, as our slogan used to be, And over time, And now it's more, but let's look at some and let's look at some of them and let's look at the way the way we behave, So, the whole nature of &quot;Wired&quot; of technological change to more of technological change. &gt;&gt; So, um, before we start... &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: There all named as icons of technological progress. &gt;&gt; So, why is Apple so &gt;&gt; (chuckling) &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Jony Ive, who &gt;&gt; It would be bizarre &gt;&gt; There's this question of, what are we doing here in this &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Jaron Lanier, who And Jeff Bezos, &gt;&gt; Amazon was a garage startup. Now it's a very large company. Two kids in a dorm... &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: His message is, &quot;All will be well &gt;&gt; I guess, first of all, I about technology, and technologies always But that's not new. That's always been the case. And, and we will figure it out. The last thing we would ever of new technologies, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But, says Thompson, there's a worry most of them &gt;&gt; There are some people in &quot;You just have to trust Throughout history, there's been between humans and machines, we've always worried about and it's always been fine. And we don't know how A.I. will but it will be okay.&quot; So, that argument exists. There's another argument, which is what I think most of which is, &quot;This is different. We're going to have labor-force like we've never seen before. And if that happens, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: There is, however, willing to take on the issue. Onstage, Kai-Fu Lee dispenses &gt;&gt; Well, I think there are so I think one, one myth is that because A.I. is so good at a that one day we'll wake up, and or forced to plug our brains But it is nowhere close &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But in interviews he takes a decidedly contrarian &gt;&gt; The A.I. giants want to paint because they're happily So, I think they prefer not to I believe about 50% of jobs somewhat or extremely in the next 15 years or so. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Kai-Fu Lee also of money from A.I. What separates him from most of is that he's frank &gt;&gt; Yes, yes, we, we've made I think, based on these 40 most of them are not impacting They're creating value, inventing a new model. But I could list seven or eight that would lead to a very clear &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He says that A.I. whether we like it or not. And he wants to warn society about what he sees as &gt;&gt; You have a view which I think which is that A.I. is not going so quickly, but is actually &gt;&gt; Yeah. A.I. will be, at the same time, white-collar jobs, and be for doctors, lawyers, and you, But the white-collar jobs are because they're a pure Let's say reporters, traders, telesales, customer service... &gt;&gt; Analysts? &gt;&gt; Analysts, yes, these can all To do blue-collar, some of the hand-eye coordination, things good enough to do. &gt;&gt; Today, there are many people &quot;Oh, my God, what are we going Half the jobs are going away.&quot; I believe that's true, but I've done the research on this, or 40 years ago, you will find that people performed back then You know, where are all the bowling-pin setters, You used to have seas of that have now been eliminated-- You can just go through field That same pattern has recurred with each new wave &gt;&gt; But I would argue that if it is multiple repetitions not once-in-a-blue-moon So, over the history of many most are small things. Only maybe three are at the the steam, steam engine, and the computer revolution. I'd say everything else And the reason I think it might is that A.I. is fundamentally in doing a job in its and it can do it dramatically &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: This argument in the age of A.I. was ignited amid the gargoyles and spires Two researchers had been poring identifying jobs that could be &gt;&gt; Well, vulnerable to in the context that we discussed essentially meant that those over an unspecified number of And the figure we came up with &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: 47%. That number quickly traveled and news bulletins. But authors Carl Frey offered a caution. They can't predict how many jobs But Frey believes that there are &gt;&gt; And what worries me the most one episode that looks quite which is the British where wages didn't grow and a lot of people actually as technology progressed. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Saginaw, Michigan, in living standards. Harry Cripps, an auto worker has witnessed what 40 years of &gt;&gt; You know, we're one of the I think we were left behind in And I just... I don't know how &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Once, this was the for one local union. Now, with falling membership, &gt;&gt; Rudy didn't get his shift. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: This day, for a Christmas food drive. Even in a growth economy, unemployment here is near Poverty in Saginaw is over 30%. &gt;&gt; Our factory has about Back in the '70s, that 1.9 had about 7,500 U.A.W. making middle-class wage with and able to send their kids to that the middle-class family Our factory today, with would probably be about That's a dramatic change. Lot of union brothers used &gt;&gt; The TRW plant, that was &gt;&gt; Delphi... looks like they're Wow. Automations is, is definitely Robots, I don't know how they I don't know how I don't know how they go to the They definitely don't pay taxes, So, you don't have the sheriffs and anybody else that supports 'cause there's no tax base. Robots don't pay taxes. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The average is $16,000 a year. &gt;&gt; A lot of the families that I both parents are working. They're working two jobs. Mainly, it's the wages, people not making a decent wage Like, back in the day, my dad My mom stayed home, And that give us the opportunity and things of that nature. And, and them times are gone. &gt;&gt; If you look at this graph of to America since the end you see a line for our and our productivity It used to be the case would increase in lockstep with The weird part about this graph is not going up the same way &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: As automation has workers are either laid off or for less pay, &gt;&gt; There are still plenty We are a manufacturing but if you go walk around you do not see long lines doing repetitive manual labor. You see a whole lot If you go upstairs in that and look at the payroll you see one or two people So, the activity is still there, but the number of jobs because of automation Now, dealing with and figuring out what of the American middle class is a really important challenge, because I am pretty confident going to have this large, middle class doing routine work. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Evidence of how accelerated change to the U.S. not far from Saginaw. This is the U.S. headquarters for one of the world's largest a Japanese-owned company called &gt;&gt; We've been producing robots And you can imagine, they've changed quite a bit. We're utilizing the artificial to really make the robots and be able to handle a broader We see a huge growth potential And we see that growth potential there's 90% of the market left. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The industry says that with that growth, &gt;&gt; Even if there were five and we reduced that down to two because we automated we might produce two times more because we automated it. So now, there might be the need or two more quality-inspection So, although we reduce we grow in other areas as we &gt;&gt; When I increase productivity Jobs go away. And I don't care what the robot you aren't replacing those ten that that robot is now doing You can increase productivity to with the global market-- that's &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: blame for widespread job loss at what's called offshoring. &gt;&gt; We want to keep we want to keep We don't want them moving to India, to Vietnam. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But it turns out isn't because of offshoring. &gt;&gt; There's been offshoring. And I think offshoring is of the jobs that have been lost. I would say most of the jobs despite what most Americans or productivity growth. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: at Ball State University He and sociologist Emily Wornell employment trends Hicks says that automation has lowering the standard of living. &gt;&gt; So, in the last 15 years, the by 15, ten to 15 percent. So, that's unusual A one-year decline A 15-year decline gives about the prospects And so that is common to the Gulf of Mexico in the middle swath &gt;&gt; This is something we're gonna These were left over from our and we're going to give them &gt;&gt; That is awesome. that is going to go a long ways, I mean, that'll really help that &gt;&gt; Yes, well, with the kids home the families have three meals to put on the table. So, it's going to make a big So, thank you, guys. &gt;&gt; This is wonderful. on behalf of us here &gt;&gt; Absolutely, you guys are And please, tell, tell all the these families will be. &gt;&gt; I mean, this is not a small The need is so great. And I can tell you it's all income classes that you might think someone But I can tell you that when you and you deliver this type who is in need, just the is incredible. &gt;&gt; We actually know that people for over 20 years after they due to no fault of their own, so or offshoring. They're at higher risk they're at higher risk But then with the we also see their children children of parents who have due to automation-- are more they're more likely to drop out they're more likely to be and they have lower educational over their entire lifetimes. &gt;&gt; It's the future of this, Because I think we're in the of what is a multi-decade &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The world is being This is a supermarket. Robots, guided by A.I., pack to cantaloupes for online Machines that pick groceries, machines that can also read and comprehend are reaching deep stores, and offices. At a college in Goshen, Indiana, a group of local business and to try to understand the impact Molly Kinder studies at a Washington think tank. &gt;&gt; How many people have gone and done a self-ordering? Anyone, yes? Panera, for instance, Cashier was my first job, in Washington, DC, it's actually for the greater DC region. There are millions of people who This is not a futuristic this is something that's In the popular discussions about almost every image is of a man or a truck driver. And yet, in our data, when we women disproportionately hold are at highest risk And that's not really being and that's in part because women in some of these marginalized like a cashier And also in a large numbers HR departments, a lot of that is more routine processing paper, That has huge potential for A.I. is going to do robots are going to do So how many people are still as switchboard operators? Probably none in this country. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The workplace of different skills, and gaining will depend on who &gt;&gt; I mean it's not a good There's been some excellent that half of Americans a $400 unexpected expense. And if you want to get to a So imagine you're going to go two months' pay, a year. Imagine you want to put savings to, to redevelop your career. People can't afford to take time They don't have a cushion, so married with the disruptions in is a really toxic mix. &gt;&gt; (blowing whistle) &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The new machines of the economy: to human resource departments; from law firms to the trading &gt;&gt; Wall Street's but every industry is going Every company is looking at all could be robotics or drones And whatever it is, every that's developed, everything in thinking about, &quot;How do to make myself more efficient?&quot; And what efficiency means is, &quot;How do I do this And I do think that when we look about opportunity and the inequality the likelihood that you won't be from where your parents were, I is very serious and gets we like to think of America as &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Inequality has been It used to be the top 1% owned a relatively small portion Middle and lower earners-- Then, 15 years ago, And inequality has been &gt;&gt; There's many factors that are and unfortunately, without being thoughtful is a driver for increased because it's a form of and automation is the for labor. And when you do that, So Karl Marx was right, it's a struggle between capital and with artificial we're putting our finger on the and how we wish to distribute the economic benefits, that that will create is going moral consideration for society &gt;&gt; This is really an outgrowth of haves and have-nots-- the poor getting poorer. It may not be specifically but as... but A.I. will And that, I think, will tear because the rich will have just and those who are have-nots will of digging themselves And with A.I. making its impact, (crowd cheering and applauding) &gt;&gt; (speaking on P.A.) I'm here today for one main To say thank you to Ohio. (crowd cheering and applauding) &gt;&gt; I think the Trump vote I mean that for whatever reason, whatever the hot button was that really hit home with these were, it was a protest vote. They didn't like the direction (crowd booing and shouting) I'm scared. I'm gonna be quite honest with of not just this country, If we continue to go in an what are we going to do? Now I've got a group of people that are making all the money in the middle So do we have to go to the point And in this case, the automation's already gonna so I don't know how I'm really worried where this leads us &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The future is by a few hugely successful They're constantly buying up and recruiting talent. Between the U.S. and China, they employ a great majority of and scientists. In the course of amassing they've also become among the &gt;&gt; A.I. really is the ultimate Think about the massive data on user preferences, and how an ad that you might buy and get a much bigger cut that Same with Google, So it's... A.I. is a set of that helps you maximize an and that objective function make more money. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And it is how these and how their algorithms reach our daily lives, that makes many people Pedro Domingos wrote the book &gt;&gt; Everywhere you go, You're trailing data, everything And then there are computers that are learning, and these trying to serve you better. They're trying to personalize They're trying to adapt So on the one hand, because the world will get without you even having to There's also a danger, because that are in control of those don't necessarily have the same and this is where I think people what's going on, so they can &gt;&gt; You know, we came into this that we were users It didn't occur to us was actually using us. We thought that we were We had no idea that Google &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Shoshana Zuboff professor emerita. In 1988, she wrote a definitive &quot;In the Age of For the last seven years, making the case that we have now of the economy, which she calls &gt;&gt; So, famously, industrial Innocent rivers, and meadows, for the market dynamic to be as land that could be sold Industrial capitalism claimed to reborn, to be reborn as labor that could be sold Now, here comes surveillance following this pattern, but with What surveillance capitalism human experience. Private, human experience is of raw material, fabricated into And it turns out that there are that really want to know what &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Like most people, Alastair Mactaggart about this new surveillance until one evening in 2015. &gt;&gt; I had a conversation with a and I was just talking to him you know, a dinner, And I... there had been about privacy in the paper, he worked for Google-- &quot;What's why are people so worked up And I thought it was gonna be like, with, you know, if you &quot;Should I be worried about and they say, is coming to the airport, And he said, &quot;Oh, you'd be if you knew how much we knew And I remember that kind of because it was not &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: That question A successful California real Mactaggart began researching &gt;&gt; What I've learned since is is learning as much about you Everything about your thoughts, and your dreams, and what you're thinking, what And with that, And so, I think... That their entire business the data of your life. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Shoshana Zuboff had &gt;&gt; You know, I'd been reading From patents, to transcripts research reports. And, you know, for years and years and years. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Her studies of Google, started in 1998 by two young Stanford grad Sergey Brin and Larry Page. In the beginning, they had no Their unofficial motto was, &gt;&gt; Right from the start, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, about their antipathy Advertising would distort and it would distort and of any search engine, &gt;&gt; Once in love with e-commerce, Wall Street has turned its back &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Then came the &gt;&gt; ...has left hundreds of begging for love and money. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: While Google had search engine for tens of their investors were pressuring Without a new business model, the founders knew that the young &gt;&gt; In this state of emergency, &quot;We've simply got to find a way And so, parallel to this were where it turns out that whenever we're leaving behind traces-- of our behavior. And those traces, were called digital exhaust. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: They realized how by applying machine learning to predict users' interests. &gt;&gt; What happened was, to those data logs and to begin to use these as a way to come up with of what a user would click on, a user would click on. And inside Google, they started pile up at a startling rate. They realized that they had to They didn't want anyone to know or how they were making it. Because users had no idea that that told so much about them, and now it was being used &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: When Google's just a few years later, the company had a market of around $23 billion. Google's stock was now as &gt;&gt; And it was only when Google that the numbers were released. And it's at that point that we and the year 2004, Google's by 3,590%. &gt;&gt; Let's talk a little about and how people consume it. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: By 2010, the C.E.O. would tell &quot;The Atlantic&quot; &gt;&gt; ...is, we don't need you to Because we know where you are, we know where you've been, We can more or less guess what (audience laughing) &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Eric Schmidt to be interviewed Google's new business model for had migrated to other companies, Roger McNamee was an early and adviser to Facebook. He's now a critic, and wrote He says he's concerned about how and Google have been casting &gt;&gt; And then they realized, there's all this data in So they went to credit card and credit rating services, and said, &quot;We want They go to health and wellness &quot;Hey, you got women's We want all that stuff.&quot; Why are they doing that? They're doing that because is about taking uncertainty Advertising and marketing you never really know who's Until now. We have to recognize that we in our lives That essentially, because better in the '50s, '60s, '70s, we developed a sense of that it will always make things We developed a trust, and the that Facebook and Google have &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The model is simply like Facebook-- and in exchange, of the millions who use it. And every sliver of information &gt;&gt; It's not just what you post, It's not just that you make It's whether you say, or, &quot;I'll see you at 6:45.&quot; It's not just that you talk that you have to do today. It's whether you simply rattle in a rambling paragraph, All of these tiny signals are that turns out to have immense &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In 2010, Facebook with A.I.'s predictive powers a &quot;social contagion&quot; experiment. They wanted to see if, through they could influence real-world The aim was to get more people in the 2010 midterm elections. &gt;&gt; Cleveland, I need you to keep I need you to keep on believing. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: They offered an &quot;I voted&quot; button together who had voted. A subset of users received In the end, they claimed to have They would conduct other Among them, one showing that by they could make users &gt;&gt; When they went to write up they boasted about two things. One was, &quot;Oh, my goodness. Now we know that we can use cues to change real-world behavior. That's big news.&quot; The second thing that they was that, &quot;We can do this in a the users' awareness.&quot; &gt;&gt; Private corporations have state without our awareness And the systems necessary to are getting a lot better, as internet of things, powered by the Alexa voice or the Google Home system. &gt;&gt; Okay, Google, &gt;&gt; Okay, playing morning &gt;&gt; Okay, Google, &gt;&gt; And those will put the we've never had it before-- living rooms, kitchens, And I find all of that &gt;&gt; Okay, Google, I'm listening. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The companies say to target ads, but helping A.I. &gt;&gt; Alexa, turn on the fan. (fan clicks on) &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Meanwhile, they are and applying for patents to expand their reach &gt;&gt; Alexa, take a video. (camera chirps) &gt;&gt; The more and more that you so smart speakers-- they're not just to recognize but they're starting to take and comparing changes over time. So does your cadence increase Are you sneezing Is your voice a little wobbly? The purpose of doing this is more about you in real time. So that a system could make like, do you have a cold? Are you in a manic phase? Are you feeling depressed? So that is an extraordinary that can be gleaned by you and asking your smart speaker, &gt;&gt; Alexa, what's the weather &gt;&gt; Currently, in Pasadena, it's &gt;&gt; Inside it is, then. Dinner! &gt;&gt; The point is that this micro-behavioral targeting that toward individuals based on of personalities. So this is precisely what simply pivoting from to the political outcomes. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The Cambridge engulfed Facebook, forcing before Congress to explain how of up to 87 million Facebook by a political consulting The purpose was to target in the 2016 presidential as well as the Brexit Cambridge Analytica had been by conservative hedge fund &gt;&gt; And now we know that any who can buy the data, buy the machine intelligence buy the skilled data scientists, you know, they too can and infect and infiltrate and with the same methodologies that uses every single day. &gt;&gt; We didn't take a broad enough and that was a big mistake. And it was my mistake, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: for numerous violations of and his company was recently by the Federal Trade Commission. He has said Facebook will now and the company has suspended of third-party apps from its as a result of an internal &gt;&gt; You know, I wish I could say we've learned our lesson and better after that, but I'm In some ways, Cambridge that were ten years old. It was really, in some ways, first-wave data science. What we're looking at now, and machine learning, is that both in terms of elections but more broadly, That is a much bigger problem, and certainly much more serious with Cambridge Analytica. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: A.I. pioneer Yoshua about how his algorithms &gt;&gt; So the A.I.s are tools. And they will serve the people If those people's interests go of democracy, then democracy is So I believe that scientists when that science can or will those scientists have a It's a little bit like the around the Second World War, who rose up to tell &quot;Wait, nuclear power and nuclear war can be really, And today, the equivalent of a and '60s are, who are doing machine learning &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: One person who about the dangers was not but an ordinary citizen. Alastair Mactaggart was alarmed. &gt;&gt; Voting is, for me, If less than 100,000 votes the last two candidates in the in three states... &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He began a solitary &gt;&gt; We're talking about fraction of the voters in a handful of states or stay home. And remember, these companies They know who's a racist, who's a homophobe, They know the lazy people and They have access to the greatest that's ever been assembled. They have the world's best data And they have essentially of communicating with you. This is power. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Mactaggart started for a California ballot for a law to give consumers In all, he would spend in an effort to rein in the Google, Facebook, AT&amp;T, all opposed his initiative. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, I was scared. Fear of looking like The market cap of all the firms was over $6 trillion. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He needed 500,000 to get his initiative He got well over 600,000. Polls showed 80% approval That made the politicians in So Mactaggart decided that a strong hand, it was worth &gt;&gt; And if AB-375 passes and is signed into law we will withdraw the initiative. Our deadline to do so is &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: a new law was rushed to the &gt;&gt; Everyone take their seats, Mr. Secretary, &gt;&gt; The voting starts. &gt;&gt; And the first guy, and he voted for it. And everybody had said the because it has this private where consumers can sue. And the guy in the Senate, &gt;&gt; Aye, Roth. Aye, Skinner. Aye, Stern. Aye, Stone. &gt;&gt; You can see down below, and then it passed unanimously. &gt;&gt; Ayes 36; No zero, Immediate transmittal to the... &gt;&gt; So I was blown away. It was, it was a day I will So in January, next year, will have the right to go to any &quot;What have you collected on me 12 months? What of my personal information So that's the first right. It's right of... we call that The second is the right And that's the right to go to on any page where they're and say, &quot;Do not sell More importantly, we require what's called a third-party You will click once &quot;Don't sell my information,&quot; and it will then send the signal that you visit: &quot;Don't sell And that's gonna have a huge of your information &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The tech companies but privately alarmed Then one tech giant came on of Mactaggart's efforts. &gt;&gt; I find the reaction among at this point, be pretty much Some people are saying, These are good ideas.&quot; Some people say, &quot;We're not sure but you're right to raise it,&quot; and some people are saying, And so, you know, we have where we point out that the auto because there are Pharmaceuticals, all of these industries are has confidence in the products, in part because of a mixture and responsible regulation. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But the lobbyists the corridors in Washington. They're looking for national privacy standard, the California law But while hearings are held, and anti-trust legislation the problem is that A.I. into our lives and work. &gt;&gt; Well, it's in healthcare, it's in criminal justice, of shopping as you walk down It has pervaded so many elements and in a way that, in many to people. While we can see a phone and there's some A.I. technology many of us don't know that when and we sit down that we're being filmed, and are being analyzed Or that if you're in the that there are risk assessment that are deciding which could determine whether These are systems which, in many in the back end of our sort And so, one of the big how do we make that more How do we make it transparent? And how do we make it &gt;&gt; For a very long time, as Americans, in determining our own futures-- we're in charge. What Cambridge Analytica taught and what Facebook continues is that we don't have agency. We're not in charge. This is machines that are but have made decisions about Who we are. And they're using that the story of us. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In China, there's no doubt In an authoritarian state, is the watchword (whistle blowing) And artificial intelligence has the country for signs of unrest. (whistle blowing) It's been projected that over will be deployed by 2020. Here, they may be used to But they also serve to remind that the state is watching. &gt;&gt; And now, there is a project which is putting camera and the corner of every village Matching with the most advanced algorithm, which they can real-time data, to pick up &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Frequent security like Megvii and its facial- They show off cameras with A.I. and identify individuals or just by the way they walk. &gt;&gt; The place is just filled with the computers are actually and trying to digest that data, and identify who each person is. And it's incredible to see so because just two we hardly saw So, a big part of it is And so the technology's really and a lot of companies have this idea that this &gt;&gt; China is on its way a total surveillance state. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And this is the for the surveillance state. Here, in the far northwest of is the autonomous region Of the 25 million people almost half are a Muslim Turkic called the Uighurs. (people shouting) In 2009, tensions with local and then riots in the capital, (people shouting, guns firing) (people shouting) As the conflict has grown, more police, surveillance technology. That data feeds an A.I. system can predict individuals prone and detect those in need of in scores of recently It is a campaign that has &gt;&gt; Chinese authorities are, arbitrarily detaining up simply on the basis But even outside the facilities are being held, most of the is being subjected to of high-tech surveillance such anymore, you know, takes place the state's line of sight. And so the kinds of behavior you know, which language do you whether you're talking to your in other countries, that information is now being and used to decide whether to political re-education &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: There have been and deaths in the camps. And for Uighurs on the outside, Xinjiang has already been as an &quot;open-air prison.&quot; &gt;&gt; Trying to have a normal life is impossible both inside Just imagine, while you're on police subject you to scan forcing you to lift your chin, and wait... you wait until you Imagine police take your phone and force you to install allowing your phone calls and &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Nury Turkel, a Uighur activist, addresses a Many among the Uighur diaspora with their families back home. Turkel warns that this dystopian is a demonstration project around the world. &gt;&gt; They have a bar codes in to identify what kind of citizen What we're talking about is a of an ethnic group. Not only that, the Chinese its methods, its technology, to other countries, namely and others to utilize, to or prevent a political upheaval &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: China has a grand and influence around the world. Launched in 2013, it started out of Xinjiang, It's called &quot;the Belt and Road &gt;&gt; So effectively is is China's attempt to, project its influence And we've seen, you know, going in in places like in Ecuador, in Bolivia-- you know, all over the world, in America's backyard, Africa's been a huge place. And what the Belt and Road to kind of create a political for the Chinese spending &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Like Xi Jinping's where Chinese contractors had arranged loans for a new and, said the Foreign Ministry, there would be help &gt;&gt; As China comes into these these loans, what you end up being sold and built out by, in these countries. We've started to see it already of surveillance systems. Not the kind of high-level A.I. lower-level, camera-based, manual sort of observation-type You know, you see it in you see it in Venezuela. And what they do is, they sell and they say, &quot;You know, these camera systems and, And it'll cost you $300 million, and we'll build a ton of and we'll build you a kind of, where you have police who can And that's going in all over &gt;&gt; There are 58 countries that to China's vision of artificial Which means effectively that of raising a bamboo curtain. One that does not need to... One that is sort of that has shared resources, shared telecommunications shared infrastructure, even shared mobile-phone that is, that is quickly going to the exclusion of us &gt;&gt; Well, one of the things is that the world and that there will be and there will be an And countries will effectively which one they want. It'll be kind of like the Cold &quot;Oh, are we gonna align or are we gonna align And the Third World gets to And that's not a world that's &gt;&gt; The markets in Asia and the on news that a top Chinese has been arrested in Canada. Her name is Sabrina Meng. She is the CFO of the Chinese &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: News of the Huawei executive was ostensibly doing business with Iran. But it seemed to be more about of the company's technology. From its headquarters designed to look like fanciful Huawei is the second-biggest and the world leader the high-speed backbone Huawei's C.E.O., in the People's Liberation Army, was defiant about &gt;&gt; (speaking Mandarin) (translated): There's no way The world needs Huawei because If the lights go out in the And if the North goes dark, America doesn't represent &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The U.S. government countries around the world the Chinese government could to their equipment. Recently, the C.E.O. promised into the company's software, but U.S. authorities &gt;&gt; Nothing in China exists free Those companies can only exist at the sufferance of the party. And it's made very explicit that they either have to respond So this is the challenge with a So Huawei, Ren Zhengfei, the &quot;Well, we... we're just a We don't take orders Well, maybe they haven't yet. But what the Pentagon sees, the National Intelligence and what the FBI sees is, But when the call comes, everybody knows what the &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The U.S. Commerce has recently blacklisted for doing business with claiming they are aiding of the Muslim minority. Among the companies is Megvii. They have strongly objected saying that it's &quot;a and our technology.&quot; President Xi has increased his on the country. In 2018, he had the Chinese so that he could be president &gt;&gt; If you had asked me &quot;What will happen to China?&quot;, &quot;Well, over time, the Great Of course, people will get they'll get access to Google... Eventually, it'll become a much with free expression And the last time I checked, In fact, technology's become And as China has gone through and wealth and openness in there has not been the that I thought. And it may turn out that, technology is a better tool for than it is for democratic &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: To dominate President Xi is depending on to lead the way. While companies like and Tencent are growing more they're also beginning to have American technology, and are With a continuing trade war the longtime argument for between the two countries &gt;&gt; I've seen more and more from a position when they &quot;Well, if we just keep engaging the lines between will slowly converge.&quot; You know, whether it's in And the transformation, where they now think So, in other words, the whole is coming under question. And that's cast an entirely because if you're diverging and of antagonism-- you know, then suddenly, technology is that you don't want to share. You want to sequester, to protect your own national And I think the tipping-point which is what is casting like artificial intelligence into a completely different is that if in fact China fundamentally antagonistic then we're in a completely &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In the age of A.I., That with so much accumulated and intellectual power, the by just two A.I. superpowers. That's the premise of a new book &gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Kai-Fu. &gt;&gt; Hi, Dr. Lee, so &gt;&gt; Really nice to meet you. Look at all these dog ears. I love, I love that. &gt;&gt; But I... but I don't like you you... you borrowed it. &gt;&gt; I couldn't find it! &gt;&gt; Yeah! you're coming to my talk? &gt;&gt; Oh, hi. I'm telling you. &gt;&gt; Oh, my goodness, thank you. Laurie, can you get this (people talking in background) &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In his book the computer walks a careful path. Criticism of the Chinese while capitalist success &gt;&gt; I'm studying electrical &gt;&gt; Sure, send me a resume. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Now, with the rise he wants to warn the world &gt;&gt; Are you the new leaders? &gt;&gt; If we're not the new leaders, (laughs) Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: &quot;Never,&quot; he writes, for human flourishing been or the stakes of failure &gt;&gt; So if one has to say who's China is quickly catching up. China actually began in A.I. only two-and-a-half when the AlphaGo-Lee Sedol match &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He says he believes should lead the way and work to make A.I. a force for good. If we do, we may have a chance &gt;&gt; If we do a very good job A.I. will be viewed as an age of Our children and their children That A.I. is here to liberate us and push us to do what we love, and push us to think what it &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But what if humans Kai-Fu Lee understands After all, he invested early which is now on the U.S. He says he's reduced his stake for the company. Asked about the government for social control, &gt;&gt; Um... A.I. is a technology for good and for evil. So how... how do governments on the one hand, and the database to maintain for its citizens, but, on a individual's rights That, I think, is also a tricky for, for every country. I think for... I think every to use A.I. probably to which that you and I would &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Emperor Yao devised to teach his son discipline, Over 4,000 years later, those words still resonate with &gt;&gt; So A.I. can be used in many for society. But the current use of A.I. with the goals of building unfortunately. But, but we could change that. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In 2016, a game of of the future of artificial Since then, it has become clear a careful strategy to harness &gt;&gt; I, I do think that democracy of these tools unless we improve and we increase at the planet level to, to deal I'm hoping that my concerns are but the stakes are so high that I don't think we should I don't think we can play with race ahead without thinking &gt;&gt; Go to pbs.org/frontline for of A.I. on jobs. &gt;&gt; I believe about fifty percent or extremely threatened by A.I. &gt;&gt; And a look at the potential in this technology. &gt;&gt; We've had issues with bias, with poor system design, &gt;&gt; Connect to the &quot;Frontline&quot; and Twitter, and watch anytime or pbs.org/frontline. &gt;&gt; For more on this and visit our website To order &quot;Frontline's&quot; visit ShopPBS or call This program is also available
