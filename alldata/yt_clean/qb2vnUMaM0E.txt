&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;All good things must come to an end... so It's time to say goodbye to Malaysia and move on with my travels&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;Especially since I have overstayed my 90-day visa by almost 3 years!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;This was mostly due to the M.C.O. (Movement Control Order), the Covid 19 lockdown and travel ban... &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;..and due to my hospitalization for foot surgery,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;and subsequent recovery time.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;Fortunately, the Immigration department was very understanding and gave me an extension&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;Malaysia has been very hospitable to me...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;..and I have enjoyed my stay in this great country&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;Malaysia even provided me with free Sinovac (Covid 19), vaccinations as if I were a citizen&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;And, as you can see from the many videos on my channel, I have enjoyed many interesting and beautiful places in Malaysia&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;A shout-out goes to Nanyang tours and travel who made most of the travel arrangements for me...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;One of the things I have especially enjoyed in Maylasia is the food...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;While most authentic Malaysian food is too spicy for my personal taste, there are a plethora of restaurants serving a wide variety of foods&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;Worth a mention are the many street-food vendors, sometimes called hawkers...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;Especially those serving one of my favourites, 'fried bananas'&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;These are bananas cut longitudinally, then dipped in batter, and deep fried... delicious but doubtless fattening...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;Saty is a Malaysian original, even celebrated in murals&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;There are many Satay places... from mobile carts, &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;to street-food vendors, &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;to posh restaurants&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;I particularly enjoyed the freshly cooked lamb satay at Satay station&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;Despite the Muslim majority, one can easily find places serving pork in KL such as Brew House&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;A shout out goes to my favourite Japanese modern-fusion restaurant, Nippori&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;Their avocado and fruit salad with blueberry dressing is amazing...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;As is their Wagyu beef burger served on pearl rice with Japanese curry&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;As a majority Muslim country, Maylasia has a great affinity for middle eastern cuisine&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;There are a plethora of middle eastern restaurants serving a variety of dishes from different regions&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;I especially enjoy the 'Mezze' or appetizer courses...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;Each restaurant offers different combinations &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;Some have a middle eastern buffet spread... especially around Ramadan&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;Many offer delicious lamb with baby Okra stew&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;A shout out goes to Namo restaurant&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;They have excellent Baba ghanoush and tabouli that make perfect side dishes...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;For their lamb kabob pita sandwich with garlic sauce&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;And lastly, a shout out to Safa restaurant&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;Which has the best hummus...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;35 Served with freshly baked pita...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;..right out of the oven&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;A great accompaniment to their excellent lamb kabobs served with rice and grilled tomato&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;As I head to Kuala Lumpur International airport...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;..I have a lot of wonderful memories of this great country, Maylasia.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='#e9e9e9'&gt;I am not sure when I will be back...
