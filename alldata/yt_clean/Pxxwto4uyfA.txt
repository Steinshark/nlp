hello friends in the current video tutorial i am going to talk about a function called threshold 1d array in labview threshold 1d array function is available in the arrays palette in that view threshold 1d array function calculates the fractional distance between the first value and the threshold y and returns the fractional index at which threshold y would be placed within array of numbers or points using linear interpolation so we got this threshold function so this is the threshold function it has got three inputs one is the array input the second one is the threshold y value and third one is the start index so threshold 1d array function it calculates the fractional distance between the first value and the threshold y and returns the fractional index at which threshold y would be placed within the array of numbers or points using linear interpolation so this function has to be used with arrays sorted in non-descending order means the array should be sorted in ascending order so you can sort the arrays in ascending order using this function in labview this is the available function in labview sort 1d array this sorts the elements uh in ascending order right so first sort the elements in ascending order or either use this type of array indicator or cons add a constant or control which has the elements already in the ascending order now so uh according to this particular element threshold value the fractional index is calculated so let's go into more details about this threshold 1d array function compares the threshold y to the values in the arrays of numbers or points starting at the start index until it finds a pair of consecutive elements such as such that the threshold y is greater than or equal to the value of the first element and less than or equal to the value of the second element fractional index or x is the interpolated result labview calculates for the uh array of numbers or points one one the input array so it is the linear interpolation right linearly interpolated result for the fractional index so let's see some example to um verify this concept so this is a 1d input array and this is the threshold value and this is the start index so suppose i want to calculate the fractional index for this so calculation is as follows example suppose the this this array and this this this is already i have explained now the calculation suppose 5 is here so i have to see where the 5 element is lying it is lying at this particular point between 5 and 6 so the index of element 5 is 1 and index of element 6 is 2 right and the distance between 6 and five is one so six minus five is one and the distance of uh this threshold value and the element five minus five is zero so zero divided by 1 will give 0 the index of element 5 is 1 so the fractional index 1 plus 0 is 1 so the result over here would be coming as 1. let's run this program so the fractional index is one let's see a few more examples so in this particular example um i've chosen the floating point values so since the uh this threshold value is 6.5 so i have to see where it lies it lies between 5.2 and 7.8 the index for 5.2 is 1 and index for 7.8 is 2 so firstly we have to subtract 5.2 from 7.8 so as to calculate the distance so 7.8 minus 5.2 is 2.6 now 6.5 is the threshold value 6.5 minus 5.2 gives 1.3 1.3 divided by 2.6 gives 0.5 so index of element 5.2 is 1 and so the fractional index becomes 1 plus 0.5 is equal to 1.5 let's run this program so when i run this program the fractional index comes out to be 1.5 let's see one more program so in this these are the elements and i have chosen the threshold value as seven so threshold value seven lies between seven point eight and seven point nine the index of seven point eight is two and index of seven point nine is three so i have to calculate the sorry i i mistakenly explained this thing the index of the 7 lies between 5.2 and 7.8 so um the index of 5.2 is 1 and index of 7.8 is 2 and i have to calculate the things as follows 7.8 minus 5.2 is 2.6 and um now 7.5 7 minus 5.2 gives 1.8 means 7 minus 5 point minus 5.2 gives 1.8 and 7.8 minus 5.2 gives 2.6 1.8 divided by 2.6 gives 0.69 the index of element 5.2 is 1 and so the fractional index is 1.69 let's run this program so the fractional index is 1.69231 labview has calculated the result to a very high accuracy let's see one more example so here the threshold value is 14.2 and i have to see where this value lies this value lies between twelve point nine and five fifteen point five i've start i have to start from the values uh at index five onwards so index five onwards the values are uh zero one two three four five six so the values are starting from nine point one nine point one ten point three twelve point nine and fifteen point five so um fourteen 14.2 lies between this and so the calculation is as follows 15.5 minus 12.9 gives 2.6 14.2 minus 12.9 gives 1.3 1.3 divided by 2.6 gives 0.5 the index of element 12.9 is 7. so the fractional index is 7.5 let's run this program so the fractional index is 7.5 so this completes the explanation of this threshold 1d array function this is in [Music] relationship to the um uh interpolate 1d array function and the calculations are similar so you have you can correlate the two functions three threshold 1d array function and interpolate one d array function and the concepts are similar i hope you have understood this function properly and i hope you have enjoyed watching this video thanks for watching this video
