&lt;b&gt;I'll add the milk at last.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It looks delicious.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Hi, I'm Fabio, the chef.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;These are today's ingredients.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'll tell you how to cook the delicious pork steak with a pork shoulder roast today.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Also, I'll tell you how to cook the traditional garlic puree in Italy and garnish vegetable recipe.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'll marinate the pork with salted rice malt.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The reason why the meat gets hard is the protein of it.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Proteaze is what breaks down the protein.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Typical food which contains the proteaze are onion, pineapple/ kiwi, pear, Maitake, and fermented food.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;1 hour after resting the pork.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's important to let it rest for about 30 to 60 min.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'm gonna grill it, but the salted rice malt might be the reason of too grilled. So, I'll take it off.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'll take off the salted rice malt lightly, then wipe off the water with the paper.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's essential to wipe off the water perfectly to make it well-browned.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'll boil the 50g of the garlic with the water to remove a bad smell.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'll boil them 3 times, discarding the water each time.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's now boiling, so I'll discard the water.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'll do these process 2 times.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;After 3 times of these process, I'll add the milk, the same amount water, and a little amount of the salt, then boil it.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Now, it's boiling. I'll turn down the heat to the low and keep it for 20min.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;After that, the garlic will get softer, then I'll puree it.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;After 20 min.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Look at this, it got soft now. Don't discard the milk as we're gonna use it later.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's important that you should make the garlic puree while it's hot as it's not gonna be smooth if it's not hot.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'll break down it by hand, then take it off the stem of it.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Salt/ Olive oil/ A little amount of the milk I used before.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;To add the milk, it's gonna be smooth.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'll add the salted rice malt.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'll blend them.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The good puree sauce is now ready.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'll grill the pork I prepared before.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's sticky so it gets too burnt easily.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'll grill the pork from the cool temperature.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Olive oil&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Turn on the heat.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'll grill it till I can hear the sound.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The pork shoulder roast easily gets hard so I'm not gonna use the high heat.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The temperature is getting high, so I'll turn it over.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This look is correct for the pork, like the mix of the red and browned.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The key to grill well is like making it hot slowly.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Hear this out, this sound is right.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This meat is not so thick, but I'll grill it slowly.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'll grill the fat completely if it's getting browned.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The fat is now well grilled, so I'll take it off from the frying pan once.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The surface of it is still not grilled now. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'll use a fish grill instead of an oven.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; I'll turn on the heat. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Check if it's hot.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;If it's hot, put the pork and vegetables into it.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;After 5 min, the meat is 80% heated up, so I'll grill it to make it browned at last.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Olive oil/ Crashed garlci/ Rose mary&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I can now smell the garlic and rose mary.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'll make the pork browned&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You should hear this sound at last.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Cook the garnish if you like.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Turn it over.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Turn it over again. It's now well-browned.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's completely heated up.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'll add the vinegar into the frying pan for the vegetables.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'll arrange it.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Salt/ Balsamic vinegar&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The steak of pork shoulder roast.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Itadakimasu&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The pork is well-heated, so it's perfect.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I marinated the pork with the salted rice malt so I used it to the garlic puree today.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So, the steak and puree sauce go well.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This way is mostly used for an appetizer in Italy.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This salted rice malt and garlic puree sauce go well with chicken and vegetables as well.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Gochisousamadesu.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This recipe is so good so I want you to try it.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Thank you for always leaving a comment.&lt;/b&gt;
