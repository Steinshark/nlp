Can you solve the puzzles that have Oh, I just pushed it through. Starting with the easiest puzzle, where all you have to do And leveling up to the hardest So, and the goal is to free the One, two, three. Wait. Let me cook. The objective is to make it into a square. Come on, bro. You have to get it in a certain position. The person helping me is SoupTimmy, With his puzzle knowledge, maybe I'll actually stand a There we go. There, yeah. There we go. How did you know that? 35. Because in Rubik's cubes, If it's a triangle, you can't fit it. So objective is just Coming up next is the The goal here is to turn and we have a limit of five minutes, Oh, there's something in there. A snake. There's, like, a door here. I assume this opens up. That's the question we're trying Is there like a hint we can get, man. So how do you open it up? Yes, because with each successful solve, we'll get a hint we can But the smart thing to do would be for the final level 100 puzzle. I don't want to use the Okay, okay. Maybe we have to. Oh, oh, wait, wait. Oh, something moved. Ok. Something moved there. Oh, there we go. Wow. That was so simple once I figured out. Okay, and this is a ten penny puzzle. The goal here is insert ten We got ten minutes for this. I get it now, ok. Ten minutes. Wait, wait. We got nine here. Okay, No, it doesn't fit. Let me cook. I solved it. What? Really? See if you can do it again, bro. Yeah, it was easy. No, I did not get lucky. I did it again. What? It's so easy. I think the trick was because What I saw was, you make an X. X's save space? Is that why? Yea, X's save the space. I don't know what else to say. This was incredibly easy. Maybe we're just smart. Let's see if the other puzzles prove that. But the later puzzles only prove that We give up. The goal here is to remove and we have 15 minutes starting now. The first thing I saw is You see how there's, a crack here, Hafu? But the question is, A gap? Yeah. You know, the lambent puzzle, like, and it opens. Maybe we move up and Or maybe we move diagonal. Or maybe we... give it a little spin... Oh, shoot. Wait, how did that work? Oh, there's, like, wood inserts here. So, no matter how I jerk it, but when you spin it, You know, dude, we're geniuses! This is level 40, It's called the balancing act. And the objective here is to balance And we have 20 minutes. Wait, can three fit on here? No, only two nails fit. Wait, wait, wait, wait, Put some weight on top. One nail on each side. Ooh, ooh, ooh. What if we do this and Okay, we got two. Yeah, yeah. Stick something through. I gotta call it quits with this one. What do you mean you call it quits, bro? We barely started. After trying everything, we finally figured out Oh. Oh, is that the answer? No. You have to balance on What if we. Oh, what if we do it like this? This is the head of the nail. Oh, we did it. Let's go, we balanced it. That's not the solution. What's the solution supposed to be? Oh, my goodness. What the freak? Let's see what we were supposed to do. See, this is so much more complicated. Sometimes, people just need to think simpler. Oh, wow. So that's the real solution. I feel like we probably wouldn't There's no way. Follow the instructions. So I think that gives us a hint. Yeah, one more hint. This is level 50. It's called: man the torpedo. And the objective is to take And the time limit is 30 minutes. I feel like there's certain angles that we have to twist it at. Just like the first one. We're learning. See, we're learning. Oh, oh, oh. I just pushed it through. It's kind of like the restroom. You gotta push. You gotta push. Maybe we should push it back in Okay, sure. We gotta take it in steps. Once we get one through, How is this making me sleepy? Stop slacking, bro. This is the definition of having There we go... There we go. I did the homework on this one. This is level 60. The eureka. What is Eureka? Eureka! Never heard of that. So the goal of this puzzle And we have a 45 minutes time limit. I think the way to start puzzles is to start with all the moving pieces. We can pull it this way, We can put the ring through here. You move the circles in here. Oh, yeah. We can move the circle in here, through the circle. So what are we thinking? I mean, I'm bad with ropes. I had trouble tying my You asked me how to tie How do we get out of this? If headphones tangled was a puzzle. Bro, you tangled it more! After spending five minutes we reset back to square one. Here's what we do. We don't tangle it. Circle through, and bring up. Yeah, bring it up. And then ball here and this through and through. Does that work? Yahoo. Wow. We get another hint for the final puzzle, because the final puzzle really hard. Oh, we got it. Okay, onto the next level. This is level 70, the Churchill cigar. The objective here is to remove this wooden cigar from the bottle. It's hard because there's the bolt And there's this little rod also The time limit is 1 hour. This is pretty obvious. I think there's a screw. There's a ball. You have to unscrew this. So why don't you push a ball Look, it's unscrewing. Oh, I saw it move. Yeah, just do this. While you're unscrewing that, Well, but let's think about this one first. I imagined this video to be much harder. I was prepared to spend days in this room. Is that out? Come on, man. Oh. Oh, there we go. Yeah. Sometimes force is all you need. We got the nut out. We just gotta take the bolt out... There we go. Got the bolt out. Now we just kinda gotta, like, shake it. Yeah, it's getting stuck there. Oh, there we go. There we go. There we go. The taste of success. This is level 80. It's called the cryptex, like, And I've been told that every be used to solve the puzzle. Oh, butterflies, sunshines, and flowers. It says, thank you for being in my life. May the joy and happiness Dearest Hafu, Whenever I get the post notification, it just brightens my day and makes The rest of the letter was but something makes me think that If you want to read it for yourself you can pause the video. Who wrote this? Your biggest fan? I don't know. My biggest fan. So, we have six dials with 26 letters each. That should be over 300 So we have to find some clues. So... miniscule, not many people say &quot;makes I feel like that's a, intentional word there. Wait, wait, wait. I've seen some lock picking videos where, you can kind of hear a click when Maybe the biggest fan is the answer. There's over 5.7 million fans. Are you thinking or are you sleeping? After hitting a dead end, All right, can we get a hint? A dictionary would help. Google Hafu in dictionary No. We should use our second hint. Yeah, let's use another one. Give us another hint. Maybe it's not what's in the but what's not in the letter. What the freak? Let's use a third hint. Yeah, let's go. One more hint. We need one more hint. Are any of the words missing anything? Oh, some spelling errors. Yeah, I don't think so. Your videos are so fun. Notification. Notification. That's missing an &quot;I&quot;. Okay, okay, okay. So we carefully read through the What is it? I got it. I see it. I love you. I. Love. You. All right, the only question is, Oh, what's that? It's a ring, bro. Ooh, Hafu has a secret admirer out there. If you're watching this video, leave your name down in the comments. Let's move on to the next one. This is level 90, small but mighty. Wow. I wonder who said that. It's called the nutcase. And our objective is to take the bolt out We have 2 hours. 2 hours to play with my nuts. Let's figure out all the moving parts. So we can spin that. Yeah, we can spin this. Do you see this, line in the middle so it looks So what I'm thinking is there's, certain combinations where you unlock the inner pieces. I give up. What other techniques did we learn? Farting on it? What do you think? Does your Rubik's cube How can you give up so easily? Oh, I get it. I get it. You know how threads work, right? Threads work by, like. It's like a spiral upwards. What we gotta do is, as we move it up, like, like, like, Well, it turns out that didn't work. So we had to resort to... You wanna use a hint? Let's do it, bro. Can we get a hint? The nuts need to be on opposite ends. Okay. They're on opposite ends. But what do you do from here? We give up. Forfeit. So the real solution is that you must and then line them up in a specific Okay. Yeah. What I said is totally correct. Look at that. There are grooves on some of the sides, We finally finish playing with your nuts. We are now on level 100. This is a puzzle box, and it's basically like an There are six different sides, and we need to solve each There are so many moving parts here, this is probably the most And because we've used up so many hints, The time limit is 4 hours. 4 hours. That's how you know it's a hard puzzle. So again, we started by examining but suddenly... You just solved the puzzle? We're at one out of six done. Yep. Next side. Since we have a ball and an exit hole, I think the goal is to move the But the problem is when they get stuck. So to unlock them, Oh, that should be easy. There you go then. Now you move the ball down. Oh, maybe we have to drop and then we can solve this puzzle. This definitely felt like We move it up and then move it down. Then, we got it. We got it here. Oh, now down here. Let's go. So our ball rolled in but it's now blocked by this wooden gate. It looks like we have to find the So there are a couple steps here. I think these represent the number. What are these arrows, though? Dude, my brain is fried, man. If you want to get a girlfriend, Really? Oh, I got it. We just randomly move these dials and onto the next side. This side has knobs at I think there's a correct Maybe, right? So maybe this is the final level. Six balls here. What does that do? It seems like we gotta turn these move freely at the bottom. After staring at this one side for we decided to use our last three hints... Yeah, let's use a hint. Go back to this side. Hmm. Another hint? Let the bottom line be your guide. So what does that mean? I don't know. Should we just get a hint? No, we're not using a hint. Then we're gonna have no more hints. Well, we're not gonna get through this. Okay, you're right. Let's get another hint. Try looking at the shape of the knobs. I mean, like, The bottom has, three indents here, one indent there. So three indents, one indent, And then to see which way that would be the plus. And then I have to find the same dial There we go. We turn the rest of the Something supposed to happen? I think a ball maybe. Oh, there we go. Got a ball. Got an extra ball. Okay, so that side is done then? We're halfway through. Yeah. Three sides done. It seems like, our goal is to move the ball But this side is a lot more layers we have to move through. What do we gotta do? Bring the ball over here? I would bring, yea let's go. This is what we're good at. Bringing balls. We're approaching 1 hour. We got it here now. We're so close. Wait, wait, wait, guys. I got it, I got it. I got it. Look at that. The ball is now at the exit. This side is done. We only have two more sides. Finally! The ball from the previous side is So we just have to figure out This puzzle seems relatively simpler. You see that ball? How is like down here? What if we move the ball here? Because where else can we move this ball? Let's see what happens here Oh, that gives it a little So it unlocks the other ball. So it looks like we have Now all we have to do is figure That should be unlocked. One more side. One last side. So the fifth side unlocked a I think that might give us a clue and unlock this entire puzzle. This. Ah, back here again. These have patterns on them. Oh, okay. Wait, wait. This says, box go that way. And then the inner sides go the other way. So basically what it's saying to me, we gotta spin it. Oh, that worked. Is this solved?.. We unlocked the box! Shoot! Here we go! What's inside? What does this do? It's a spin top. That's it? Just a reminder that it's it's about the friends Anything you learned about puzzles? If you can't solve it, just spin it. And hopefully it works.
