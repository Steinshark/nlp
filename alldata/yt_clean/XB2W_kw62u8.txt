Elvis Presley, Disneyland. [ Normal voice ] And then, restrain himself from launching for the assembled press attacked the attorney general and the judge overseeing it.

They have a value. The value of their brand is more than everything else One other thing. We have a clause in the contract which tells, essentially, When you take a look don't believe anything you read. Do not believe anything. If I weren't running, I wouldn't have I wouldn't be seeing you but I'll be seeing -&quot;I'll be seeing a lot of you&quot;? He sounds like a creepy husband [Imitating Trump] &quot;I'll be You'll never find [ Normal voice ] That was three days. He started Friday during the At one point, the water and he still kept going. Also, generally speaking, I would say it's not exactly to attack the judge right before &quot;This guy's an ass [bleep] I hate his guts, and I hope [ Laughter, applause ] Most of that rant was but I do want to touch on a few -The reason I got indicted If I didn't run, I'd be sitting like Biden does every time, even though he's supposed -Yeah, I just can't imagine A beach implies relaxation. If Trump ever did go to a beach, he'd spend the entire time [Imitating Trump] Mr. Sea-- Those are my chips. Excuse me. I'm talking. Squawk, squawk, squawk, Excuse me.&quot; [ Normal voice ] But arguably, he said during his rant was when he claimed for any of the false statements because his financial documents that says nothing -We have a clause which tells, essentially, We have a clause It's like It says when you take a look don't believe anything you read.

What cinematography! Did they get the same director [ Laughter ] The only thing -- Wonderful. The only thing missing What's Trump saying &quot;Uh, I think he's, uh, in terms of the, uh, of -- of the, uh, uh, legal that he's, um, uh, completely Now, in a way, before he stepped foot because last week, the judge found Trump his business assets for years. And now, the attorney general to bar him from doing business which means Trump -We begin with a major ruling against Donald Trump In a 35-page decision yesterday, found the former president and their companies The judge found Trump &quot;repeatedly submitted about the value and other insurance companies,&quot; and that his financial &quot;based in a fantasy world, The attorney general's team in this case that Trump should in the state of New York. -The former president of iconic properties -Is it clear?

Judge Engoron called that &quot;a discrepancy of this order by a real estate developer sizing up his own living space can only be considered fraud.&quot; -Trump inflated In other words, I wouldn't be surprised Remember how we all thought That's photoshopped. If you remove the filter, [ Laughter ] This ruling undercuts Everything about him is a lie. Not only were his businesses but he even pretended was three times bigger Next, we're going to find out I'm kidding. And yet, somehow, this fraud very well be the least As we all know, he's got four upcoming and trial dates have been set We'll tell you all about that, Wait.

The United States government at least not -The House Speaker had his back He was not going to get anywhere with his Republican There was just going on inside the conference. And so, he had to work with -This all comes, Jake, among some of the Republicans. -The fate of House Speaker is uncertain at this time are pushing for his ouster. -Do you still support him, -I had my questions. -We cannot blame the Democrats -This is a huge mess. -I've been frustrated I thought we would be -&quot;Yeah, we're Republicans.
