Suspension is in Sport+. AMG Dynamics are not just oh, yes. I've turned the and then it's going on the brake, right That should kick even a launch And then away we go. JONATHAN ELFALAN: This thing is bonkers. It looks bonkers. It drives bonkers. I love this thing. It's the pinnacle-- say my definition just because I think comfortable to whereas this, you can you can drive on the track. It's beautiful in any respect. How do we launch this thing? It's the same BMW dance. There are a ton of but you can You've got two pre-configured So I just press M2 twice, I've got Sport+ engine, sport steering and sport brake, sport, which allows the M3 to to the rear, keeps it I kind of like that Of course, we have to control completely turned off And we got to have shift mode at the launch. Now, something as we've explained in the past, Once you get the launch, they and there's just too much So what we do is just We still keep the Shift and that just allows the car to It's going to be I think these cars so it's a matter of who's [MUSIC PLAYING] COMPUTER VOICE: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

ALISTAIR WEAVER: 135 miles JONATHAN ELFALAN: How was the experience ALISTAIR WEAVER: Yeah, plain faster, to be honest. I caught you a little. You were slightly I caught you, as always. BMW was launching I think this was I felt like I caught you up. And I think at we were about head to head. But then this just It just feels a bit heavy. JONATHAN ELFALAN: Yeah. I mean, this thing-- I know it's not a but the controls and the makes it feel lighter. The steering is light. The brakes really just come on. You're really not stamping yet you get so much braking. I was enjoying the It wasn't a whole lot of work And then it just gets and it makes good ALISTAIR WEAVER: This doesn't I know this has been the But it doesn't sound high-performance machine. It just doesn't, sadly. This is like a I mean, yeah, it performs. But it just lacks that little JONATHAN ELFALAN: Yeah, agreed. Simpler times were want to have a whack So why don't we switch ALISTAIR WEAVER: Can we that I feel a bit less than I would in BMW with all its carbon fiber? JONATHAN ELFALAN: Hey, I like as long as I'm winning. [MUSIC PLAYING] ALISTAIR WEAVER: So what which, let's face it, is a much Well, like all BMWs, the Launch You have to rub your and then stand on one and eventually it'll work.

JONATHAN ELFALAN: I if it's much nicer looking. But I will say, as far as that thing is sharper, just a little a little bit more everything This Mercedes is doesn't quite have to keep up with that CS. ALISTAIR WEAVER: Yeah, This is still sort some curiosities about that. They got the gearbox the way that the launch control But when it all it launches unbelievably well. BMW does launching better And also, it feels Particularly the braking, of feeling of it moving It feels like a sports car. It feels like a It really does. NARRATOR: Whew, wasn't that fun? We love doing these races, so this video so we can Here's the track conditions. And for the best numbers-- 0 to 60 goes to the Quarter mile goes to at 124.1 miles an hour.
