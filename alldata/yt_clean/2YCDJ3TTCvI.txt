Take it. Get lost! Damn it! That's all? Are you not suffering enough, huh? Come here, break her other leg, make it useless too. This. . . Haha! Look at this! Check this out! It looks like I have been too nice to you. Too soft on you guys? You don't know how to get money now, huh? If you lose your eyes, or your hands, you'll know how to beg for money! Hey, you two, you're his brothers, right? Weren't you caught here together? Alright then, take them too, cripple them! Let me go! I have money! I can cover what they lack! Please spare them! It's you again? Once or twice is okay, but here isn't a charity. There are no handouts here! Do you love protecting them? Alright then, you can join them as a cripple! They're from the Lake family. They. . . They're all from the Lake family! Haha! We'll be rich! Stop! Stop it! Take them all! Lock them up! Hurry up! Take them away! I'm sorry, Aurora. We got you involved again. Don't say that! The policemen, they'll save us! Aurora, today I found this. You're closer than a sister to me! You help me now, and we'll help you when we grow up! Take it, Aurora. Even if we part, this necklace will help us find each other! Really? Yes! We promise! Pinky swear, no breaks for a hundred years! Aurora, what's wrong? Looks like a fire! There. . . There's a washer! Put Aurora in the washer! Found them! Three more kids here! Aurora! No one else here! Retreat! In the middle of the night, come to clean this mess, I'm a temp not a slave! This washer's still on, and it seems fine! Perfect, we need a washer at home! Oh wow! Eighteen years later Kevin, weigh this for me. Hey, Aurora. Modern time now, and you're still hand-washing clothes? No washing machine at home? Washing machine. . . Aurora. It's okay now, Aurora. Kevin, don't panic, I'll get the doctor! Don't be scared, I'm right here. It's alright. . . All these years, your trauma is still so severe. Back then, they were so cruel to lock you in the washing machine. Dad, they just wanted to protect me back then. But I, I couldn't see. I've been a burden all these years. What are you talking about? Look at you, you're now at one of the best universities, teaching music! I'm so proud of you, I couldn't be prouder! It's getting late, hurry to work. Oh my brothers. . . are you guys okay? Get lost! Get out of here! Hey, Miss. . . Are you okay? How dare you block my way? Are you tired of living? Late-stage cancer. Hey, Kevin. Aurora got into a fight at school with someone! Simeon, is there any news on Aurora yet? If it weren't for Aurora back then, we would've all been crippled and never returned to the Lake family. Have you been looking seriously? You think I don't want to? If they hadn't confirmed back then that her body wasn't in the fire, I'd have thought she was dead. Didn't Cora ask you to pick her up from school? If you're late, she'll throw a fit again. I know. Cora's the only sister I have now. I can't let her suffer even a little. Mr. Simeon, Mr. Lucas, bad news! Ms. Lake got into a fight! What? Who did this to you? It was you! Did you bully my daughter? Hey, hey, watch your mouth. Your daughter, as a teacher, bullies her students, and you dare talk like that? I didn't. She hit me with her bike and then demanded I kneel to apologize. I refused, so she pushed me down. From start to finish, I never bullied her. You're just a low-level worker, and your dad, he's just a trash collector. My family donates billions to this school every year. Do you think Mr. James will believe you, or believe me? My daughter would never hurt a student. Why did you bully my daughter? Why! Dad! It's okay. You're just a trash collector, and you better be respectful to us. Don't cross Ms. Lake! Ms. Lake, this trash collector didn't scare you, did he? All these years, you're the first to dare block my way and even get me hurt. Alright, if you don't kneel today, you can't leave here! Why should I? You're the one who hit me with your bike first, but you want me to kneel to apologize? It's not reasonable! Does the heiress of the Lake family need to give you a reason? Lucas. Where are you hurt? Do you dare bully my sister? Don't touch my daughter! What if I did? Not only her, but you, okay? You old fool! Don't hit my dad! Get out of the way! Are you tired of living? I'll make you die now! Lucas! Mr. James! Is this how you handle things? Aurora, you're fired. F. . . Fired? Mr. James, they're the ones who hit my daughter. Where's the justice in that? Haha, justice? In Starfall, the Lake family is the top family. The Lake family is the law, and the Lake family is justice. They're from the Lake family. . . Aurora can't see. Thanks to the previous president, she got this job. I don't have much time left. If she loses this job, how will she take care of herself? Mr. Lake and Ms. Lake, I apologize on behalf of my daughter. It's our fault. Please don't fire her. Dad, why are you apologizing to them? We did nothing wrong! If they want to fire me, then let them fire me, I'd rather lose this job than bow down to people like them. People like us? What kind of people? People like you and your dad, are disgusting, filthy lowlifes. And you dare argue when you're clearly wrong! Are you tired of living? You. . . Yes, yes, sir. You're right, and it's all my fault. It's all my fault. I apologize, I apologize! I don't have time for this. Lucas. Take care of Cora. I Got it. Want me to spare your daughter? Sure. As Cora said, let your blind daughter kneel to her and apologize! You're going too far! What gives you the right to bully people like this? What right? Because I was born privileged. Because I have three powerful brothers! I used to have three brothers, too, but they would never be so unreasonable like you! You had three brothers, too? I guess, one is a cripple, one is mute, and one an idiot, right? Haha! Exactly! Hey, your low-class trashy brothers, can't compare with my brothers! My brothers would never be like you, not knowing right from wrong, twisting the truth. They are always the best brothers in the world. The best brothers? Then why aren't they here to protect you now? Alright, I'll ask you one last time. Will you kneel? I won't kneel. Dad, let's go, I don't need this job. Sir, my daughter has a strong will. How about this? I'll kneel and apologize to you. Please, spare my daughter. Dad! What are you doing? Let's just leave! I get it, are you trying to keep your daughter from knowing you're kneeling to me? Yes. You've got a lot of pride, I respect that. I don't need your respect. But do you know, your dad is kowtowing to me right now. He's paying for your pride. Is it loud enough? Is it satisfying enough? Dad! Are you okay? You're bleeding. . . Aurora, I'm okay. I'm just sweating a little. Dad. . . Mr. Lake and Ms. Lake, have you both calmed down? Can you please spare my daughter? Oh, it's getting late. Ethan's waiting at home for us to have dinner. Here's the deal. Escort me to the parking lot, and I'll let my brothers spare you. Alright! Alright! Thank you, Ms. Lake. Ms. Lake, is this enough? Will you spare my daughter now? Sure. Lie down. Ms. Lake, what. . . What did you say? Be my human footrest. I just got a new car. The chassis is high and hard to get in. You look perfect for it. Let me see how it feels. If you won't do that, it's fine. I gave you a chance. When your daughter gets fired, don't blame me. Dad, let's go! They're devils, just toying with us, don't fall for it! Aurora, it's okay, it's okay. Ms. Lake is so light that a few steps won't hurt. Wait, Cora, don't forget, there's a party tonight, put on your heels first. Thanks, Lucas. Heels? What are you going to do? Don't torture my dad! Dad, let's go, we don't need this job. Let's leave! I'm begging you, Dad! You better stay down, Kevin. If I fall, your daughter will lose more than her job. Dad! No! Dad! His bones are so hard. It's disgusting to step on. Get lost! Dad! Her job. . . My daughter's job. . . Dad. . . Aurora, don't be mad. Aurora's a year older now. Take a look at the gift Dad got you. Dad, I'm not a kid anymore. I don't need birthday gifts. The bell on this was custom-made. Your eyesight isn't good, but the hair tie is for you, and the bracelet is for me. When you hear Dad's bell, you'll know where I am. When your bell rings, I'll appear immediately in front of you. Thank you, Dad. Quick, put it on. It looks great and so beautiful. My daughter looks fantastic in it. Ah. . . Dad, rest early. I'll head to my room. Alright. I heard what happened today. Cora is still young, but you encouraged her mischief. What you two did was a bit too much. Ethan, why. . . Why are you defending those poor people? You don't know how disgusting they were today! That's enough, Cora. Ethan, I promised to protect Aurora, but I couldn't find her. So I can't bear angthing bad happening to Cora now. Aurora loved music, too. If she were here, she might be a teacher like that woman today. Aurora. . . Aurora. . . That Aurora is your sister, then what am I? Your real sister is me, not her! Lucas, how's the celebration preparation going? Many VIPs will attend, so make sure it's perfect. It's ready. Let's eat. Aurora, where are you? I can protect you now. Why won't you appear. . . Dad, can we go back? The Lake family members are all bullies. I don't wanna go to their banquet. Aurora, it's not easy to find a job. Mr. Lake promised if we come, he won't fire you. It's just a banquet. It is not a big deal. Hold back today and apologize to them. Dad, I did nothing wrong. Why apologize? That's how society works. If you're rich, you make the rules. It's my fault. If I were stronger, they wouldn't dare bully you. Why's he dressed like that? How dare he come there? Isn't he embarrassed? Kevin, I invite you to the banquet kindly. How could you dress like this? Go, take him to change. Aurora, it's okay. I'm just changing clothes. We should be thankful to Mr. Lake. I'll be right back. Aurora, why are you upset? With so many people here, my brother won't hurt him. Haha, you poor folks. Do you all love using dog bells as hair ties? If I ring it, will you come? Give it back! Come and get it! Haha! Lucas, catch! Haha, it really is a dog bell! Hey, look. Doesn't she look like a dog? Too bad. You're just a little off. My necklace. . . Don't touch it with your filthy hands! No way. . . It must be my imagination. Aurora! Dad. . . Haha! Mr. Lake, didn't you promise to spare her? Why are you still bullying her? Are you telling me what to do? Just do what I told you to do! Or your blind daughter will lose her job and end up on the streets! Lucas, why did you call them over? I called them to help you vent, but she touched my necklace, and now it's not so simple. Come here. In a moment, don't make a sound. If you do, I promise your daughter will never find a job in Starfall. Did you get it? Mr. Lake, spare my daughter. I'll do whatever you say. She can't see, she can't lose her job. Hmm, okay, after you pour the water, you can go. Where's my dad? You're leaving, but your dad hasn't changed clothes yet. What? You want him to wear my clothes? I get it. Just don't trick me. Of course, stay quiet. Yes. Pour it. Is it not done yet? I said pour, so do it. Stop talking and pour! Dad. . . Is that you? Keep going. No! You're lying to me. I heard my dad's bell. What are you trying to do? Not going to pour it? I'll help you then. No! No! This water. . . is poured on my dad, right? Keep going! I'm begging you, please! Please don't hurt my dad! I'm begging you, Mr. Lake! We don't need this job anymore! Keep going. Ah! Dad! Dad. . . I'm fine. You're going too far! Me, too far? When you bullied my sister, weren't you going too far? Exactly! But it's just some hot water. Why are you acting like that? I didn't. I never bullied your sister. Never? My sister wouldn't need to lie about someone like you, would she? Or do you think that shedding a few tears and acting innocent will make me believe you? Besides, you shouldn't have touched my necklace with your filthy hands! You have no idea what this means to me! Haha! Stop it! Mr. Lake, you can't do this! Aurora can't handle this! When she was young, she was trapped in a washing machine. She has severe trauma from it! Trauma? Then I'd love to see how many spins it takes to spin her to faint! Hey. Trapped in a washing machine? Then, is your brain waterlogged, too? Haha! Stop it! What are you doing? Aurora, are you okay? I'm right here. The necklace. . . My necklace! Dad. . . It's their fault. I. . . Kevin, you. . . Doctor. . . Dr. Lake! Dr. Lake, please ask Mr. Lake and Ms. Lake to spare Aurora! Stop it! If you bully him again, I'll tell others what you did! It hurts so much. . . I'm sorry, this is all because of me. . . It's okay, from now on, walk with me, and no one will bully you again. Okay. Aurora. . . Dr. Lake, what did you say? Aurora grew up in an orphanage. How could she suddenly have a father? You two went too far today! Look at what you've done. Do you have any sense of dignity as young masters and ladies? Why has the necklace fallen again? Ethan, you look sharp today. Ethan, it wasn't me! It was them! You can't blame me! It has nothing to do with them. They're not involved! It was us who overestimated ourselves. . . Sir, may we leave now? Of course, today's incident was the Lake family's fault to begin with. Kevin, this is my business card. Your illness can't be delayed any longer. Take this, and it'll reduce some of the medical expenses. Thank you. Illness? Dad. . . Hey, Ethan, Ethan, you don't know if these people might be carrying some virus. Don't get too close. I think Simeon has spoiled you too much. Kevin. . . Dr. Lake, what's wrong with my dad? It's not looking good. He needs to go to the hospital now. Guards, get the car quickly! Ruining Lucas' celebration and leaving in our family's car, I really don't know how these two got so lucky! Hey! What are you standing there for? Can't you see? Clean this up! All this filthy blood on the floor. Who knows how many germs are in it? It's disgusting. You two are lucky today, running into Ethan. If I hear again that my sister gets bullied at school, I won't let you off next time! Now, get lost! Lucas, where's your necklace? Stop! Give me back my necklace! The necklace. . . How could the necklace be missing? Did it fall somewhere? Look for the necklace for Mr. Lucas. No need to search. During the whole banquet, only those two got close to me. Who else could take it but them? Hand over the necklace! Mr. Lake, there must be a misunderstanding. We wouldn't dare to steal from you. Mr. Lake, my dad is coughing up blood. He really needs to go to the hospital now. I'm begging you to let us go! Why do everything coincide? Ethan just mentioned that this old man is sick, and you start playing the sympathy card. You must come prepared! What's your plan? Steal something and then fake illness to leave? I didn't! How about we search them for it? Then we'll know! Search them! That's enough, Lucas, Kevin is a patient I've known for a long time. I trust he would never do something like this. Ethan, I didn't say it's definitely them. I just want to search. Is that too much to ask? That's the last thing she left us! The necklace honors her memory! If she were here, I believe she wouldn't want you to search someone without evidence. Evidence? Searching two lowlifes, scumbags like them, do we need evidence? Simeon. Today's incident clearly involved Lucas and Cora! Ethan, you're just too kind, and deceived by these two. Especially Kevin Leah, this scumbag. My dad is not a scumbag! How dare you slander my dad! My dad has never done anything wrong! Slander? After the school incident, I looked into your background. Do I need to slander a thief with a criminal record? I knew these two had ill intentions. He just got burned by hot water, and she got spun around a bit. They deserved that. Exactly! It looks like they definitely stole Mr. Lake's necklace! What a family they are! I forgot Ms. Leah is blind, so let me read it out for you word by word. Kevin Leah was detained for theft for seven days. Damn it! It really was you! Give me back my necklace! My dad would never steal anything! He was trying to put out the fire but was framed by those people! In the end, the police cleared everything up. My dad didn't steal anything! I trust my dad! If it wasn't your dad, then it must be you. A thief's daughter. Even if you're blind, you must still be skilled at this kind of thing, right? I didn't do it! It isn't up to you! Give it to me! Stop it! Ethan! You wretch! Aurora! Do you have any idea what this means to us? Damn it, you wretch! Mr. Lake, this necklace clearly belongs to Aurora. I know it well. Aurora has worn this necklace for eighteen years! How can you hit people without knowing the truth? It's her necklace? Ah, I'm sorry. I was too rash. Can you. . . Can you forgive me? You say it's her necklace? Yes! How dare you? How dare you! How. . . Enough, Lucas! She was caught red-handed and still daring to argue! Okay, since you're so intent on messing with us, I'll admit it! Yes, I took the necklace! Beat me up if you want! But I'm begging you, I'm begging you. Please take my dad to the hospital. He really can't take this anymore! She is still playing the victim! Enough, since we've found the necklace and vented our anger, let's end this here. Besides, it was the Lake family that was at fault today. If there was a misunderstanding. . . What misunderstanding? She admitted it herself! Everyone has moments of no choice. Lucas, Simeon, have you forgotten what it was like when we were kids? If your eyes were gouged out or your hands cut off, you'd know how to beg for money! Let them go! Don't let me see them again! Let's go. Ms. Leah. Doctor, how is my dad? Kevin was under Dr. Lake's care. Dr. Lake has done his best to extend Kevin's life. But without surgery. . . Doctor, how much would the surgery cost? Dr. Lake has done his best to reduce the medical costs for your dad. But even so, the surgery still costs three hundred grand. Three hundred grand? Where am I supposed to earn money? Who's there? It's me, Ms. Leah. What are you doing here? You're not welcome here! Not welcome? This is my family's hospital. With just one word from me, I can kick your dad out right now! Alright, Ms. Leah. I know you need money right now. I'm here to bring you some money. It all depends on whether you want to save his life or not. Well, well, a fresh new girl, huh? I've never had someone like you. Hey, I just want you to sing in front of everyone and entertain us a bit. But if you walk away and make me embarrassed before my friends, I'll have someone throw your dad out of the hospital. You better think carefully. Open it! Open it! Lucas! Drink up, drink up! Lucas! Hey, Cora. What's going on? Ms. Leah, during the day, you act all pitiful before Ethan, like a poor, helpless thing. At night, you're working here? I really thought you'd suffered some kind of enormous! Mr. Lake, I've never offended you. Why do you keep humiliating me? Look at you, a rat living at the very bottom of society. Yet you chose to bully my sister and drive a wedge between me and Ethan, and you even tried to steal my necklace! Isn't money what you want? Here, it's all money! Oh wow, let's play a little game. In ten seconds, pick up as much money as you can. Whatever you pick, I'll give you! The game starts now! Ten, nine, eight, seven. Hurry up, there's more! No money for Dad's treatment, huh? Six, five, four. There's still more! Alright, I'm giving you money. Why aren't you kneeling yet? What are you pretending for? What are you trying to do? Give the money back to me! Ms. Leah, now that you're here. Just have a few drinks with my friends. No! No! Ahh! Where do you think you're going? I'm begging you, Mr. Lake, please let me go! My dad is waiting for me to get the money for his treatment! Please let me go! You're not going to listen to me? Drinking is your damn reward. Don't you get it? The necklace? Wasn't my necklace taken? How is it here? Aurora, I also found this today. From now on, you'll be even closer than my sister. You're helping me now. When we grow up to be men, we'll help you, too! Could it be. . . Could he be my brother? Lucas, the way you poured the drink into her mouth was so fantastic! I'll tell you, while at school, the way she acts so tough is disgusting! I always knew she was no good. Just like her trash-collecting father. They're both the lowest of society, filthy low-life! I tought her a lesson today. Daring to steal my necklace? Every time I see her, I'll hit her! Lucas, that's so cool! Let's play the game! My brother would never treat me like this. I must be mistaken! Aurora, we've secured the money for Kevin's surgery! What? Here, drink some water. Thank you, Dr. Lake. You said the Lake Group can cover my dad's surgery expenses. Is that true? Of course, given your family's situation, I can help you apply for Lake Group's medical assistance. But. . . Dr. Lake, is there a problem? No, I've looked at your eyes. Though the damage is severe, modern medical techniques can potentially fix it. Dr. Lake, are you saying there's hope for my eyes that I might see again? That's right. But. . . Lake Group's medical assistance only has one spot. Your eyes can't wait much longer. Dr. Lake. My dad is my most important person. As long as I can save him, I don't care about anything else. Alright. Sign the papers. Once you sign, Kevin can have his surgery. Dr. Lake, where do I sign? You can't even see the contract. Aren't you afraid I'll trick you? Dr. Lake, you are a good person. I trust you. Wait a moment. Here. Oh, alright. Your name. . . Aurora is the most beautiful name in the world. It means the dawn. Aurora is Earth's greatest gift to humanity, the most magnificent performance. I understand. Thank you. What are you doing? Mr. Lake! Simeon. How dare you seduce my brother! Lake Group's medical fund was not for someone like you and your father. I disagree! Simeon, Aurora is a staff of Lake Group. Wasn't the Medical Assistance Fund founded for someone like her? Ethan, you were fooled by her. Her father is a thief. She has even almost stolen Lucas' necklace. The scum like you and Kevin are not deserving of the Fund. Simeon! Stop it! I disagree. Mr. Lake, I don't know what we did wrong to you and why you hate us so badly. But, Mr. Lake, my dad's situation is serious. If he doesn't have the surgery, he won't have much time. Please, Mr. Lake. Please help us. If you can let the Fund help my dad, I can work for Lake Group for a lifetime. Or we can do anything you want. Please, Mr. Lake. Lucas holds the most share of this hospital. You should ask him to help you rather than me. Stop playing a show here. One more thing, stay away from Ethan. Not anyone can join our Lake family. Stand up. Don't worry. I will help you. You can just take care of Kevin. Dr. Lake, you don't need to. You've helped us a lot. I can do this by myself. I'll find a way to persuade Mr. Lucas Lake. See you, Dr. Lake. Mr. Lucas Lake, I. . . Haven't I told you to disappear? How dare you still come to me? Mr. Lake, I was wrong. Please forgive me and help us. I know why you're here. You want to ask me to approve your application of the Fund for Kevin. Mr. Lake, my dad is almost dying. It was all because of me before. I can do anything for you. But please. Please save my dad. Haven't I given you a chance before in the bar? As long as you make my dudes happy, I can give you everything. No. I can't do such things. If my dad knows it, he'll definitely refuse to be treated. I'm begging you. Please save my dad. Then I have nothing to say. Get away. No. He's the most important person of me. I can't make that happen. I'm begging you! Please. I'm begging you! I'm begging you! Mr. Lake? Mr. Lake? Where am I? Who are you? I'm Lucas Lake. Are you insane to catch me? Ah. Lucas Lake? You are right the one I want. Have they answered the call? Go ahead. If they don't answer it, I'm gonna kill them right now. I must buy some time. Ethan and Simeon will definitely help me. You want the money, right? How much do you need? Name the price. Money? Lake Group can do anything. Even if I get the money, I can't spend it. Are you fooling me? What about woman? How long have you been with a woman? She's our staff. If you can let me go, she's all yours. Don't! Shut up! Shut up! I'm not interested at all. You know what, Mr. Lake? We're just here to kill you. We're calling your family to clean up your dead body later. But now, I can give you a chance, Mr. Lake. If you can make her die for you, I'll let you go. How about it? I can't die. I can't die now. Don't hurt me! Don't kill me! Take her life first. I haven't found my sister yet. I can't be ended here today. Take her! Don't look at me. Don't look at me. I thought you were tough before. Never expect you even ask a woman to rescue yourself. Hey, you. Mr. Lake asks you to die for him. Aurora, I can't be ended here. I haven't found my sister yet. You must have someone important to you, right? You must know my feelings. Ah. If you can do it for me, I can do anything. I can help your dad. I can give him a large amount of money. Are you sure? Money is not important at all compared with my life. If money is not important for you, why did you do this to us? Your life matters, but our lives don't, right? No. I just want to find my sister. If I had already found her, I won't care them now. Remember what you said. I agree. Besides, if you can find your sister in the future, please be nice to her. After all, it's not only your own life. They're coming. Emm. We decide who to kill, not you two. Get Lucas Lake done now. Don't! Don't hurt me! Don't kill me! I don't want to die! Don't hurt me! My family won't let you go! Don't do that! Ethan, how's she? Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance now! Simeon, when she came to pretect me just now, it felt like she's our sister. Simeon, could it be that she's our sister? No matter who she is, she saved you. From now on, we'll protect her for sure. Mr. Lake, the one we just caught doesn't know anything. The criminals just ran away. Find them! Go find them no matter what method you take! Yes, sir. I'll never let them go. Bitch! No wonder this necklace seems familiar. It's you, indeed. With me here, don't you ever try to steal them away. Finish it. I'll take care of your cousion and your family. Yes. Where am I? Don't move. Mr. Lucas Lake? Ms. Leah, you risked your life to save Lucas. I'm thanking you on behalf of the Lake family. We were sorry for what we did before. From this moment on, you're the Lakes' savior. Lucas. Aurora, uh, I was wrong for what I did to you and Kevin. I've asked all our connections to help Kevin find a suitable donor match. We'll cure your eyes, as well. We'll pay for all of it. Is it true what you say? Sure. You might not believe in me, but you have to believe in Ethan. Ms. Leah, don't worry. He's telling the truth. Alright, thanks. Ms. Leah, when you were young. . . Lucas! Lucas! Thank god you're alright! I was scared. It's all because of you! It's you who made Lucas get caught! Why are you still here? Cora, don't talk to Ms. Leah like that. She saved Lucas. Apologize to her. It was all because of her! Lucas! Cora, apologize to her. Ms. Leah, I'm sorry. Bitch! It won't be long. You'll be disgusted by everyone soon. Dad, I'm healed. You don't have to feed me. Aurora, you're gonna do the surgery today. I'm worried about you. Here, one more bite, okay? Dad, have you found the donor? Yes. Mr. Ethan Lake said that I can have the surgery next month. Good. Aurora, have you found your necklace? Well, I went to the place I was locked but didn't find it. I must lost it somewhere else. Emm. It's okay. Even if you lose it, they will find you eventually. Yes. Hi, Mr. Leah. Ms. Leah, we are ready for the surgery. Yes. Ethan, Ethan, how's it going? It's already halfway done. Mr. Leah, you're a patient as well. Take care of yourself. Eat something now. We'll stay here. Alright, I'll come here later. I've investigated it. Aurora was adopted. What? So. . . Could it be. . . Simeon! I found the criminals! Who's behind them? It's Kevin and Aurora. What? Aurora was harmed so badly just to save Lucas. How could they do such a thing? Ethan, I know that you don't like me. But why would I cheat you all? Aurora planned this accident just to make the Lake family give her the money. You were all fooled by her. It was her scheme to save Lucas and get hurt. No. That's not true. I promised to cure Kevin already. Why would she do that? Lucas, even you don't believe in me now. Alright, take a look at this. This is the place I got locked. Why would she be here? After you were saved, I had a surveillance camera installed there. I don't know why would she be here if she's not the one behind this. Fuck! Bitch! How dare they! I was sorry for them before. Mr. Lake, what's going on? How dare you! How dare you fool me? I won't let you go! Lucas. I said it before that I won't forgive anyone who harmed Lucas. Terminate the surgery now. Mr. Lake. Mr. Lake, if we terminate it now, her eyes might never have the chance to be cured. I said terminate it. Don't you get it? Mr. Lake, the surgery can't be terminated. We can make changes if there's anything we did wrong. Please, don't terminate it. Aurora needs her eyes to find someone important to her. She can't be blind for her whole life. Fuck you! When you planned to hurt me with Aurora, you should have known it! Mr. Lucas Lake, there's gotta be a mistake. We've never planned to hurt you. Please! Don't terminate the surgery. I'm begging you. I'm begging you. Mr. Lake, we saw it clearly ourselves when Ms. Leah got stabbed. If it had been just a bit off, she would've been dead. What's more. . . Stop it! I'll never have such a malicious sister like her. She deserves to live in the mud for the rest of her life. For Ethan's sake, I won't terminate the surgery. But we won't help you anymore for your disease. We paid seven hundred thousand for Aurora's eyes. You have to pay us back, no matter how. Let's go. Thank you, Mr. Lake. Thank you, Mr. Lake. Mr. Leah, stand up. Dad, I can see you! Very well. Very well! What's wrong? I just bumped into the wall when I was walking. It's no big deal. Never mind. Have a rest. I'll get the doctor here. Get the doctor? No need. Without us, the Lakes, you can't even afford to get a doctor. Mr. Lake, why are you here? Aurora planned the accident and got herself a chance to cure her eyes. Now that the surgery's done, you don't need this anymore. Of course, I'm coming to visit you well. Mr. Lake, what are you talking about? I. . . Dad! I'm fine. You bastard. I'm here to visit her. Don't play the show to me! Dad! Oh. Nearly forgot. Without us, you can't live for long. You'd better find a way to get the money for your daughter! Mr. Lake, what are you saying? I have nothing to do with it. Nothing to do with it? The cameras got you on tape. Are you still lying? I'm not stupid! What? Shut up! Come here! Get these two bastards out of here. Mr. Lake. No! Please! She just ended the surgery. She can't leave now. Hurry. Clean this room up good with some alcohol. Dad, how are you? Dad, I'm sorry. It's all my fault. I shouldn't have got the surgery first. You should get treated fist. It's okay. The most regretful thing I've done is that I didn't make more money when I was young so that I couldn't afford to cure your eyes. I'm more than happy since you aren't blind now. Dad, you'll be fine. No matter what, I'll definitely get you through this. Oh. Is she the daughter of that dying thief? Anyone can be a teacher nowadays. Who knows how did she get this position? It's said that she slept with the former principal. Cora, what are you doing? Don't be so excited. Ms. Leah, I just thought that you look suitable to be with trash. Ms. Leah, please clean it up. Cora, no matter what, I'm your teacher in school. My teacher? Oh, I forgot to say. You didn't know that you're just a janitor here who earns three hundred a month now. I've never done anything wrong. Why did you make me a janitor? Is it hard to get it? Ms. Leah, we're the shareholders of this school. Of course, I can let you do anything. What? You're not willing? I remember that you owe us seven hundred thousand dollars. Oh, and you even have a dying dad. Alright. I'll do it. That's it. Ms. Leah, please clean up all the trash in school. I don't want to see any trash here. It's not easy to fool me. Don't move. You passed out from heatstroke. Are you Ethan? How do you know it's me? You've helped us a lot. I can recognize your voice. I always wanted to thank you. It's okay. It's no big deal at all. But how do you become a janitor now? Has Lucas done something to you? No. Ethan, do you forget that she almost made me dead? I just asked her to do some clean-up. What did she act here with you? Lucas! It's hot outside. She really did pass out from heatstroke. She's a total liar! Who knows what's in her mind now? Ms. Leah, don't clean up outside anymore. You just finished the surgery. You need some rest. Just do your job in the buildings. Thanks. What an actress! I really don't understand why he's so well to you. Hello, Simeon. Are you in school now? City lights dance like whispers in my head. Just get out. Simeon, the three teachers just now are the best singers in our school. Are they still not qualified? All of the top families will attend this investment promotion conference. With their ability, we'll become a joke in public. If only Aurora were still here. She's really good at singing. If she can't get coached properly, she can definitely become a talented singer. Simeon, I'm gonna ask more teachers to participate in the selection. Is it hurting? The rivers are talking, and the mountains sigh. Underneath the wide-open, endless sky. Alright, it'll be fine. Aurora, where are you? The rivers are talking, and the mountains sigh. The rivers are talking, and the mountains sigh. Are you the one who's singing? I'm asking you! Yes. I'm singing. Why are you here? Don't you know that there're a lot of important files here? A thief, just like you, should only clean up the restroom. What are you waiting for? Get away! Wait. You don't need to do the clean-up anymore. Mr. Lake, I won't be here anymore. I'll go clean the restroom right now. Please don't fire me. I'll give you a chance. Three days later, I hope you do great on the conference. If you do great indeed, we'll help you with your father's disease. Isn't she the daughter of the thief? I didn't know that she would attend as the lead singer. Exactly! What did she do to seduce Mr. Lake? Don't men just like this type? Faking and acting. Even if the lead singer not belongs to us, it should belong to Cora. Why did she get it? Bitch! You are really good at playing with men, right? Once Ethan, and now Simeon. You are really a slut! Ms. Lake, I don't get it. Stop acting! Such an elegant dress looks ugly on you. A trash like you should stay in the trash bin forever! You shouldn't be here. No! Ms. Lake, this is the only dress for the lead singer. I can't sing if it's broken. Sing? You? People like you should only do clean-up. Do you know it? Stop it! Ethan? It's not what. . . Shut up! Cora, we spoiled you too much before. That's why you have become so arrogant now. Ethan, how could you scold me like that because of her? I'm your sister! Cora, it's not your first or second time to bully her. You don't even care about the Lake family now, right? Do you know how important this show is to us? Take care of her. Make sure no more mistakes tonight. Yes. Ethan! Let's go. This is broken. I'll buy you a new one. Bitch! I won't just let it pass. Thank you, Mr. Ethan Lake. Never mind. But Cora was spoiled too much by us so she's too arrogant now. She's the only sister of yours. If my brothers were with me, they'd spoil me, as well. Sir, here you are. This is a lucky draw ticket from our store. You can keep it. When you have more than fifty of them, you can do a lucky draw in our store. Tape the coins together so they won't scatter. Tape the coins together so they won't scatter. Do such coincidences really exist in this world? Mr. Ethan Lake? Let's go. Thanks. I'll definitely protect this dress well and not get it dirty. Alright. Could she really be my sister? The rivers are talking, and the mountains sigh. Underneath the wide-open. . . If our Aurora's here, she should be at her age now. Mr. Lake, is she a teacher here? She's great. She's just a janitor. So you dislike her. She's just a trash. I don't give her a shit at all. If so, Mr. Lake, how about giving her to me? I haven't seen such a pretty for long. If you like it, I can give her to you. She's only a nobody. Cora, you're the heiress of the Lakes. Pay attention to your behavior outside. Okay. A trash is a trash, indeed. It's just a dress. Why take is so seriously? Poor thing! Ms. Lake, what's the matter? Ms. Leah, who are you exactly? Why do all my brothers feel unique about you? Even me, their sister, can't compare to you. And even I tried every trick to mess with you, they just keep having feelings for you time and time again. I don't understand. If there's nothing else, I'm leaving. Wait a second. Just say it. How much do you want so you can leave my brothers? What do you mean? A hundred thousand dollars? A million dollars? I don't need it. I just hope you can cure my dad's illness as you promised. You're indeed quite aloof. How about we play a game instead? Cora! Let's see who's more important to them. Cora, how are you? Are you fine? Cora, are you okay? Bitch. You bullied Cora last time, but we forgave you. How dare you hurt her again? No. She. . . Stop! How could Cora hurt herself to slander you? I changed my mind about you these days. Did that give you nerve to hurt Cora again? Simeon, anyway, after these days, I believe she can't be a bully. Instead, before the concert, Cora cut up Ms. Leah's dress. Did you do that? Ethan, how could you protect her without knowing the truth. Well. I damaged her dress in a fit of anger. So, I wanted to compensate her. But she asked me for a million dollars. I don't have so much money. Then, she. . . All right. It's fine to damage a simple dress. But you're so shameless, the Lake family will not provide medical assistance for your dad. Mr. Simeon Lake, what do you mean? Tina, cancel the medical assistant to Kevin Leah. And Aurora Leah, the school cleaner, has bad character. Hence, fire her. Guard. Mr. Simeon Lake, I've finished the concert for the Lake Group as agreed. Why do you do this to me? Just because of Cora's words? Why not? She's my sister. Who are you? I also have brothers. Let them defend you then. I'm telling you. Your brothers must have forgotten you. Lucas! Simeon, Ms. Leah helped us finish the concert. We can't bring shame on the company. Yes. Simeon, Ms. Leah might just lose her mind for money. We should take the company into consideration. Don't worry about me. Cora, thank you. Aurora, I forgive you one last time. I won't fire you, but you and your dad will never get any help from the Lake Group. What should I do? What should I do? If you want to get money, come with me. Mr. Lake, my dad is dying. And I owe seven hundred thousand. Please let me off. Don't humiliate me. Stop pretending. You bullied Cora and set my family up several times. It's kind of me not to kill you. No. I didn't do what you said. Don't argue. I know you lack money. I can give you a chance to earn money. No need. I will figure it out by myself. Stop. Did I order you to leave? Figure it out by yourself? You're just a cleaner for three hundred a month. How could you handle it? Even if you work all your life, you can't pay it back. Ah. To be honest, at the concert, my friend admires you. He has a rich family. As long as you sleep with him, I'm sure you'll get enough money to handle all of your problems. Mr. Lake, I've told you I won't do such a thing. Do you think you're tough? I'm telling you. It's not up to you. If you refuse it, you will lose your job. If you don't even earn three thousand a month, how long will your dad have to live? What do you want to do? Mr. Lake, I have no way out. If you keep forcing me, I'll end my life here. Sorry. Please forgive me. Come on. Go ahead. If you don't have the guts, don't pretend to be tough. You had your chance. My brothers, where are you? I'm missing you. Hello, is that the family of the patient in bed thirty-eight? When he was discharged, he left something in the hospital. Can you come here? Discharged? Be quick. Old man. I'm telling you. Although you're old, you can't be lazy. If you don't finish it, I won't pay you. Dad. Aurora, I. . . I'm. . . Dad, let's go back. Continue your treatment. Dad. Stop wasting money for me. I won't be cured. I just want to earn more money when I can still move. Listen to me. Don't treat me, okay? Dad, no. My necklace is missing, and I may not find my brothers forever. Dad, you're my last family. However. . . Dad, don't worry. I'll raise money. Mr. Ethan Lake. We can ask Mr. Ethan Lake for help. He may help me get the medical assistance. Can it work? Yes. Dad, you'd better go to the hospital and try to get better. You will recover. Dad, wait a moment. I'm gonna make a call. And I'll send you to the hospital. Mr. Lake, I will do what you said. I brought her here. Omar. Uh. Why are you interested in this malicious woman? Mr. Lake, you've been with coquettish women. So, you don't know a pure girl is also charming. Ah. Well. Since you're here, take off your dress. If you make me happy, you will get all the money. Oh. That's right. Go ahead. I took her here. But why am I upset to see her doing this? Eh. Mr. Lake, why not play together? I have no interest. I'm leaving. Come on. Why did you stop? Oh. You want me to help you, right? Bitch. Don't touch me! Don't forget your promise. It's my brother's necklace. You're closer than a sister to me! Stop pretending. My brother. . . What? Lucas. Let me introduce her. She's my sister. Ms. Lake. Aurora, don't have any expectations. They're the true family. Cora Lake is their sister. They may have forgotten me. How dare you slap me? No way. No. Bitch. Behave yourself. Ah. How dare you run? I don't want money. Please let me go. I don't want money. If you had begged me, I would have let you go. But now, I must get you. Hahaha. Ms. Leah, I thought you were virtuous. However, it turns out that you're a vain bitch. Mr. Lake, please help me. Cora, let's go. Okay. There is a good restaurant nearby. Let's go there. I told you. Aurora, you're not a match for me. How dare you ask Mr. Lake for help? Who do you think you are? Well. What am I to them? Jerk! Release her! Aurora, don't be afraid. I won't let you be hurt. Dad. Aurora. Aurora, don't worry. I'm here. Dad. Dad. Old man, are you a fool? Was I too kind to you? She lacks money, so I help her get work. Don't mess it up. Do you know how expensive my shirt is? How dare you touch it? You like performing your family affection, right? Well. Leave your hand here. Dad. Get me a knife. Are you deaf? Which hand? Mr. Lake, please let him off. I'll pay you. Pay? How will you pay me? With your life or do the job with a low salary? Get lost! Mr. Lake, you can do anything to me. I'd rather do anything than let Aurora get hurt. No. Please. You don't answer me. Then, I'll choose. Right hand. No. Left hand. Well, right hand. No. Stop it. Simeon. Ah. Are you from a wealthy family? Yes. Our parents are the most powerful in Starfall, so they will find us. That's great. I have no family. Before I was taken by the bad guy, I grew up in an orphanage. It's okay. Don't worry. Aurora, after our parents find us, I'll tell them to take you as our sister. In this way, I can protect you forever. Okay. Simeon, did you come to protect me? Lucas, put down the knife. There's no need to attack the lowly trash. You're lucky. It's you again. You keep coming to cause trouble. What on earth do you want? Sim. . . Mr. Lake, I didn't. I. . . Mr. Lake, we didn't cause trouble. Mr. Lucas Lake has gone too far. If I hadn't come in time, Aurora would have. . . Old thing, do you think your daughter is a treasure? I can tell you she did it of her free will today. What? Mr. Lucas Lake, I know my daughter well. She will never do such a thing. Stop slinging mud at my daughter. Slinging mud? Old thing, you can ask your daughter if she did this of her free will. Aurora, is what he said real? It's because of your disease. She threw away her pride to earn money for your treatment. In my opinion, you should end your life. Anyway, you can't live long. End it here, or you'll drag her down. Aurora, I'll ask you again. Did you do this willingly? Did you? Dad, I'm sorry. Dad. It's all my fault. How can I stay alive? I was wrong, Dad. How can I stay alive? I'm sorry. Don't hit yourself. Dad, I was wrong. Dad. Dad. From now on, you're no longer my daughter. My treatment has nothing to do with you. Stop worrying about me. Dad. Dad. Drive them out and clean up the room. Yeah. He spits out blood every time. I guess he carries many viruses. You don't need to drive me out. I'll go by myself. Dad. Dad. Wait. Do you have my permission to go? Huh? Mister, please. My dad is seriously ill. I can't let him go home alone. Please let me go. It's none of my business. Come on. How dare you touch the woman who might carry viruses? Let her go. Mr. Lake, you're right. Get lost. Thank you, Mr. Lake. Don't let me see you again. Do you have painkillers? Thirty dollars. Pay first. Do you have cheaper ones? This. This is too expensive. You don't have the money? How can you get ill if you're poor? At this point, you should end your life and burden your family less. Here. It's for animals. Two dollars. Hey. Let me make it clear to you. I can sell you the medicine. But if something happens to you, I'm not responsible. Dad, this is for animals. It will damage your health. I told you not to worry about my treatment. You're not my daughter now. Dad. I grew up in an orphanage, then got caught by bad guys. I almost died. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have this life. I was blind over the years, and you took care of me all along. How can I. . . How can I watch you die? I know you're a good girl. I don't blame you. If I had come late today, you would have. . . Dad. Aurora. Promise me. From now on, leave my treatment alone. I only hope you can have a good life. That's enough for me. Lucas. Cora. What's up, Lucas? Did Aurora Leah really do those things like you said? Have some food. Omar, how useless you are. You actually let Aurora run away. Do you know my brother started to get suspicious because of this? Cora, I didn't expect Mr. Simeon Lake to be at the club. Those two poor things displayed their family affection and disturbed Mr. Simeon Lake. Enough. Get rid of Aurora for me. Be quick! You'd better leave her no chance to appear in front of my brothers. How dare she steal my brothers? Doesn't she know what a lowly thing she is? I got it. Ms. Lake, don't worry. I've set up a trap for the Leah family. This time, I'll be very neat. You know that. If it weren't for you, how could I have been interested in Aurora? Stop talking nonsense. Did you deal with the family of the two criminals well? Yes, of course. I won't spare those who dare to blackmail you. Aurora, your rival is me, so you can't win. This is our Aurora's necklace. How can it. . . Go identify the one who left the bloodstains on the necklace. And investigate the accident again. Dad. It's great. You can be cured. Aurora, isn't this too coincidental? We have nothing to do with the Bauer Group. How could we win the prize? Dad, don't worry. I called the customer service of the Bauer Group. They confirmed they had such an activity. Moreover, Dad, we can't delay your treatment. Even if this might be a fraud, we can't give up our last hope. The Bauer Group is famous in Starfall. I don't think they will trick us. Aurora, you're right. We can't give up our hope. Yeah. What do you want? Hey. Ms. Leah, long time no see. What do you want? I tell you my daughter won't do that kind of thing. I warn you. If you don't let us go, I'll call the police. I guess you want to enter the Bauer Group, right? How. . . How do you know? Why don't you guess my surname? Guess. Have a guess. Huh? Haha. My surname is Bauer. Haha. Come. Take that woman away. Aurora, run away. Stop displaying your family affection. I won't buy it. I'm an illegitimate son. Don't say I go back on my words. I've given you the money. I'll see how much you love your daughter. Beat him up. Aurora. I won't allow you to bully my daughter even if you beat me. Beat him up. Dad. No. Dad. Dad. No. Please stop it. Dad. Dad, I'm merely an adopted child. I'm not worthy. Come on. Continue. Beat him up. Beat him up. Haha. Dad, run. Run away. Run away. Stop it. Lucas. Lucas. Why did you get out of the car? Today is my birthday. Ethan is waiting at home. Moreover, we shouldn't delay for them two. Lucas, get in the car. Simeon, Ethan told me this morning to help Aurora Leah and her father when I meet them. So I have to. Lucas, no matter whether you believe what I said today, but if you run across Aurora Leah and her father, help them out. As for the reason, you'll know this afternoon. Mr. Lake, the two of them agreed to work for us if we cover their medical expenses. Look. They wanna run away after taking the money. Take a look. The card is on the ground. We didn't agree with you. You suddenly beat my father for no reason. How indecent you are. Lucas, let's go. Perhaps they suffer from some weird disease. But Ethan said. . . Come on. Ethan was bewitched by this woman. Let's go. Lucas. I wish I had never saved you. Cora, what's your wish? Simeon, the wish won't come true if I tell you. Cora, your wish will come true if you're sincere. If you haven't done anything bad, why are you worried that your wish won't come true? Ethan, what are you talking about? I'm your sister and the young lady of Lake Group. What bad thing can I do? That's right. You're our sister and the young lady of Lake Group. Why aren't you satisfied? I. . . Ethan. It's Cora's birthday. We managed to stay together. Why did you spoil the fun? Come on. My birthday girl, let's eat. This is your favorite. Have more. Simeon, I want to go to Amgeria. Can you give them a dozen million to get me admitted? Don't you like universities here? Why do you have to go to Amgeria? That's because our Cora thinks the air in Amgeria is sweet, right? Ethan, I know you like Aurora Leah, but you can't always go against me because of her. I'm your only sister. Ethan. Oh, by the way, Simeon. Lucas. I have found our Aurora. Ethan, what did you say? You found her? Are you serious? No way. Didn't Aurora Leah. . . Impossible. There must be some mistake. What's wrong, Cora? We found our long-lost sister. Don't you feel happy for us? Yes. Of course, I'm happy. You've been looking for her for years and finally found her. I'm happier than anyone else. Really? I. . . Yes. Of course. Well. Ethan, you haven't met her for so many years. Will there be any mistake? That's right, Ethan. We haven't seen her for years. Will there be a mistake? The necklace. Ethan, it's been eighteen years. Does our sister still have it? Thankfully, I tossed the necklace away long away. Humph. I knew Aurora Leah couldn't win. Yes, of course. How could she throw away the necklace? Why do you have the necklace? What's wrong, Cora? Of course, I found the necklace and I knew our sister was there. Why are you so surprised? Never mind. I was just too excited to see the necklace. Simeon, let me take a look. They fit. They fit perfectly. It's our Aurora. Where is she? We haven't seen her for years. She must have changed a lot. Can I recognize her? We're going to see her soon. I wonder if she can recognize us. I only found the necklace. I'm not sure where she is. They have the necklace. So what? Starfall has a large population. They can't find Aurora Leah soon. I think she will be ruined when they find her. I'll still be their only sister then. It's okay, Ethan. After all, her necklace has been found. We will find her if we use our connections. Mr. Ethan Lake, the owner of the necklace has been identified. So quick? Impossible. Why, Ethan? How can you identify our sister so soon? Didn't you only find her necklace? I think fate doesn't want to separate us from our sister anymore. There is her blood on the necklace. Hurry up. Open the file and take a look. Wait. There's blood on the necklace, but it might not be her blood. What if someone else left the bloodstains on the necklace by accident? Even if it isn't our sister's, this person must have something to do with our sister. Cora, even if we find her, you are still our important sister. What's wrong, Ethan? Is it that our Aurora has. . . Simeon. Lucas. Our sister is Aurora Leah. What? Ethan, what did you say? Who was our sister? I said Aurora Leah is our sister. Aurora Leah is our sister? Your dad is kneeling to me. He's paying for your pride. Isn't he humble? Isn't this exciting? Dad. Dad. Look at her. Doesn't she look like a dog? Don't touch my necklace with your dirty hand. No way. How can Aurora Leah be my sister? This is impossible. Aurora Leah is our sister. She looks so much like our Aurora. I should have known it. Simeon. Simeon, where are you going? I'll go find Aurora, my sister. Yeah. I'll go to her too. Wait. Simeon. Lucas. Aurora Leah is not your sister. You've been fooled by Ethan. Cora, why fussing at this point? Simeon, think about it. If Aurora Leah is the one, why did she catch Lucas? She sought benefits at the risk of Lucas' life. I believe the girl who once risked her life to save you wouldn't ever do such a thing. So Ethan smeared the blood on the necklace to get Aurora Leah into the Lake family. Simeon. Sit down. Yeah, Ethan. Aurora Leah bullied Cora before and even planned the accident. How can she be our sister? There must be some mistakes. Ethan, our sister is the kindest person in the world. She won't do such a thing. Ethan, you're being foolish. I know you like Aurora Leah, but you can't help her into the Lake family by this way. Your sister means so much to you, but you actually use her identity to help such a vicious woman into the Lake family. She'll be sad if she knows. Right? That bitch played a trick and talked Ethan into doing this. We shouldn't have spared her back then. Cora, you won't give up until you fail. Ethan, why do you talk to me like this for that woman. I'm very disappointed at you. Come on, Cora. Ethan was just bewitched. Let's see who was bewitched. No way. Why is it you? Ms. Lake, are you surprised to see me? Impossible. Impossible. How can you come here? Bitch, of course, I have to come here. Otherwise, how can I avenge for my family? This woman asked my brother and me to catch Lucas for her. She promised to pay for my mother's treatment. But she actually went back on her words and starved our mother in her sixties to the end. She even had my sister crashed in a car accident. How about this necklace? Do you know whose it is? The necklace belonged to the woman who was caught along. Now everything is clear. Aurora Leah is our sister who has disappeared for eighteen years. Sister. Ah. It's you. It's all your fault. If you hadn't framed Aurora again and again, how could I have done so many bad things to Aurora? But. . . But I'm your own sister. I'm your own sister. Why do you only care about Aurora? Why? Haha. But it doesn't matter. Your Aurora might have been. . . haha. . . ruined by Omar. Haha. She asked you for help just now. You. It's you. You sent her to hell. You sent her to hell with your own hands. Simeon. Don't mind me. Go. Go rescue Aurora. Okay. Aurora. Aurora. Mr. Leah. Are you okay, Mr. Leah? Where's Aurora? Where is she? Please save Aurora. She was taken away. Omar, if you dare to hurt Aurora, I'll make your family miserable. Don't. Please. Don't. My dad is ill. Please spare me. Bitch, do you think you have the right to negotiate with me? Huh? Haha. Well. It's your honor to serve me. After all, you're lowly. Haha. Look at her. Don't you think she is pretty? Huh? Wow. Haha. Bitch, you turn me on when you struggle. Haha. Come. Press her down for me. Press her down. No. Please. Come on. Don't be afraid. You'll have her after I'm done. Okay? Come. Mr. Bauer, if she get hurt seriouly by accident, we'll get in trouble. After all, the Lakes have been looking for her. I'll take on the responsibilities. Moreover, she's not their biological sister. Our backer is their own sister Cora. Okay? Don't be afraid. Besides. . . No. I can't die. My dad is waiting for me outside. Catch her. Search for her. The bitch dared to hit me. I won't let her off. Search. Bitch, I dare you to run. Ah. Are you tired of living? Mr. Bauer, something seems wrong with the woman. Come here. You, go fill the washing machine with water. What a surprise. You're afraid of washing machine. Ah. No. No. Bitch, it's not up to you. Come. Stuff her inside. Haha. Omar, let go of Aurora. Who dares to hurt my sister? Aurora. Aurora. How are you feeling, Aurora? It's a stress reaction. Why is her stress reaction so seriou? When I first met Aurora, she was stuck in a washing machine. The doctor said she suffered from a serious trauma because of this. It's all our fault. If it weren't for us, Aurora wouldn't have been stuck in the washing machine. I even treated her badly at the banquet. Come on, Lucas. We should send Aurora to the hospital now. Let's go. Yeah. The hospital. Catch them all. Mr. Simeon Lake, it's Cora. Cora forced me, Mr. Simeon Lake. If anything happens to Aurora, the Lakes won't spare you. Mr. Simeon Lake. Mr. Simeon Lake. . . Mr. Simeon Lake! Aurora, please wake up now. Your brothers have solved all my problems with the treatment. Cora and Omar were put in prison by police. Aurora, please wake up. Can you please look at me? It's my fault. I didn't protect you. I believed in Cora and hurt you. Aurora, if you wake up, I'll make you become the happiest girl in the world. Aurora, I've prepared your favorite dishes. I bought many beautiful clothes. As long as you wake up, I'll give you whatever you want. Aurora, wake up. I beg you. Aurora, I found this today. You'll be our sister from now on. You helped us today. After we grow up, we'll protect you in return. Take it, Aurora. Even if we separate, we'll find each other with the necklace. Really? Yes. Come on. Pinky swear. Pinky swear. Promise never change. Dad.
