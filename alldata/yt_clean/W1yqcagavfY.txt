Our tracked packages make their west of Toronto. But most don't stay long. They're spreading. Just like Amazon itself, across Ontario. With that enormous growth comes Amazon admitted in 2019 it spews small country. So last year, a pledge Today, we are announcing Amazon becomes the first [David] But as we're asking whether returns Online returns are not But they are the biggest So we ask them repeatedly, what happens to They won't tell us.

[] [David] Inside those walls is Amazon returns every single industrial shredder in there. Why?! Our recycling system, not only is extremely, extremely broken. Recycling is, like, our last we want to dispose of items. We could re-sell, we could re-home That would be, like, way [David] Amazon says the e-waste facility by mistake.

Good to meet you. So, we got three pallets You willing to take a look at it Yeah, I'll take a look! You got a little Roy Dirnbeck's been in the years with several stores I'm going to put and we'll All right, let's do it. Remember those pallets of from a liquidator? We're about to find out They put the best stuff on brand names like the good stuff's going to When you start digging in the gonna throw in the rest When you what do you think? This is returns, this is stuff companies, companies, they can't so they just find fast the truckload, You seeing more of this? Trailers and Okay, let's crack Let's see what you've got. [David] We've got Things he can sell again, or toss out. It's a used food product. -[David] Okay, what about this? It says &quot;defective&quot;, then just already know it doesn't work. [David] Foldable burlaps Storage cubes, everybody Here, we got a guitar, man. Let's see what kind [David] Strings are Roy shows us that at least that ended up in liquidation, he in the garbage. When you think about the volume over your career, like, a lot of returns from Amazon, how much in the dumpster? I'm scared to think about how landfills because it's endless [David] You're actually trying -a new life. I try not to send If it's something I can save somebody some But can you No, obviously. Look how much trash we [David] All this trash shows to liquidation for a new life While there are American experts estimate five all retailers end up in -Hi, David. Good. [David] Meera's tagging returns ended up. [David] We're here to Oh, no. So I'm thinking that this get stored. [David] Not quite, but she's joins us, too. Remember, she's a Meera, not so much. So we bought all these things on just like this. -It's awesome. Okay. So we returned it, and we wanna show Okay. I'm not thinking I just truly have It does make you Ultimately, it's the consumer [David] Digging for Do you have a story should investigate next? Tell us all about it and Facebook. [David] This is We're tracking And we're about to reveal where new bag like this one. -I love it. I, for sure, would. Like, you would Of course. [David] Okay, so we in just as good condition, And where do you I would love to That garbage location That's insane! Oh, my God! -I'm not happy. I'm not happy! I'm just truly shocked by condition, so for it to end up to me is truly I would want that bag. What's upsetting about that were going to the then I would just re-sell that. Right? Or donate it, or let Yeah, exactly. My question, too, is why are if this is what's happening? [David] All great questions. Unfortunately, we have that should not be in here. [David] And we take them to University in New Jersey. He spends as much time in He's got a PhD in supply So a backpack just like this tossed it in the garbage. What do you think about that? That's disappointing. They did-- probably, I don't but some kind of cost value analysis and found out this is gonna cost us more to just toss it in the trash. So that's unfortunate. I think most folks When you look at things that others who might be in need, think a lot of other consumers as well. [David] When we ask they say it arrived So in this case, who Amazon did. We dig up Amazon Canada's who sell on the site. Sellers are only given two a product, either pay to ship it it by selling, or destroying it. [ Speaking French ] [David] An investigation Amazon throwing out of unsold goods and returns. Shortly after, Amazon starts a third-party sellers. There's one in the US, and UK, The environment is actually know that folks are gonna say think about the millions transactions that are the impact is incredible. [David] Do you think you and an explanation by the company? Yeah, I would say 100% [David] Our trackers show some Others, the blocks, printer and but in doing so, cover more than I just truly have for everybody at that company. It does make you Again, I'm truly shocked. I don't know what to say. We want answers from for an on-camera interview. They decline and say in a inconsistent with They say the majority of recycled, or donated, some ends up in the garbage. Exactly how much? They won't tell us that. What colours do you guys want? I want green -Please. [David] Meera is doing her theirs, too. What about the rest of us? Well, you can find some Amazon's warehouse deals site, and did you know most likely type of Ultimately, we and return less. I expect Amazon to listen or desire. They're a huge company, making change. [Asha] We're wiring up... [Makda] We have as many [Asha] ..to get the low down It's $200 to do the $80 to come to your house. Okay. But they didn't tell me that. Because if they nobody's gonna come.
