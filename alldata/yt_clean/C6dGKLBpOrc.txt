[English subtitles are available] Pah! Son of a bitch! Another empty one! How many times have I told you? You will die if you eat too much kaolin! Do you know that? Father. I'm hungry. I haven't eaten for three days. Bear with it even if you're starving to death. If you can't find anything today, don't think about coming home. Father. How about we forget about it? They all say that Coffin Mountain is haunted. In this world, there are demons everywhere. Being eaten by a ghost in this mountain is better than starving to death outside. Look at the coffins in this mountain! How long can we finish robbing them! Hurry! Father! Ah! Father! Father! Father! I'm here! Top-quality Phoebe Sheareri! Any one of the gold pieces in here is enough to buy you a lifetime of food. Ah. Father! Blood! This is cinnabar. This is so strange! Even if the Blind Huang in our village exorcises evil spirits for others, he will use only a little bit of it as big as his fingernail. Light it for me. I'm rich! Hahaha. We found a wealthy coffin! We're rich! Pack them up. Hahaha. We're going to be moneybags! Magu's Birhday Offering. Ah. What? The statue of Magu? Father. What are you doing! Father! Father! Father. You can't do this! Father. Father! Father, what are you doing? Father. Don't worry. I won't treat you badly. I'm rich now. Father. Come. Wake up. Father! Ah! Ah! Father. Why did you act like that, Father? Father, what happened to you? Father! Ghost! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ghost! Father, wait for me! Ghost! Father! Father, wait for me! Father! Father! Father! Father! Ah! Ah! Father! Father! Ah! Father. [Coffin Mountain Tomb] These two tomb raiders didn't find anything in the end. Instead, they gave their lives to the goddess Magu. These were all made up by storytellers to scare people. Hey. Brother, you should believe these stories. The goddess Magu has ascended. Her human body is buried in this Coffin Mountain. It's open. Thank you, brother. Girl, remember to keep the key next time. Okay? Yes. That's it? We can buy another one if we lose this one. Why bother him? This is the bamboo dragonfly you gave me. Good girl. Go to sleep. Go. OK. Don't be afraid. My two disciples were sick before. Although their faces are disfigured, they are not bad guys. Brother, don't blame me for talking too much. I've been in business for many years and met many people. But... With your outfits, you don't look like ordinary locksmiths. You can't rob the tombs on Coffin Mountain. Brother, you are overthinking. We're not going to Coffin Mountain. We're going to Longtang Village to meet an old friend. Buns! Hot buns! Young man. Prepare these things. At nine, meet me at the morgue in the south of the city. [Morgue] There's no one here. You two don't need to disguise. Tsk. Mu Qing. Help your senior brother. Yes. Master. Yes. Master. Brother. Clench your teeth. Ah! It hurts! Can you be gentle? You hit me so hard every time. You should practice more. Your head is tougher than a steel shell! Stop! You stop! Alright. Stop it. Take out the things I asked you to prepare. Yes. Master. Master. With a tableful of dishes, are you going to worship the gods? It's a treat. What? Treat? Who can we treat here? What do you think? All we can treat here is... ghosts! You two take turns to guard the night. Don't let the incense burn out. What if the incense accidentally burns out? Master. Wake up. Senior brother. Wake up. It's midnight. It's your turn. OK. Wake up. Can you take care of me for once? With a giant fake head, I couldn't sleep well for several nights. I can finally have a good sleep. If you don't get up, I'll stab you with a needle. What's wrong? Hush. Ah! Help! Master! Ah! Master! Help! Ah! Ah! Ah. Sister! Help me! That was close. I almost couldn't have kids anymore. Master. Hurry up! Master. Why did you hit us? This is the Gu insect of the Illusion. You two fell into the trap. What? Master. I think I'm too poisoned. I can't get out of the hallucination. Old man. Stop playing tricks. Hahaha. Senior brother. How have you been? Greet your uncle. Uncle? Iron Finger in Feng Shui, Zhang Poshan. He Laogui, Gu God in Black. So you're our uncle, along with our master. Just ride on your master's wave. Old man, It's been 20 years. You're still obsessed with alchemy. You summoned me here with a secret letter just to catch up? Magu dreamed of a thousand years later. The sea had changed into farmland three times. Brother, do you remember how our Master always talked about this Magu's jade pillow to his death? Luo Manzi somehow got the jade pillow. Now, he's planning to recruit strong men and blow up the tomb on Coffin Mountain. Instead of letting Magu's treasures fall into the hands of the evil, why don't we take out the treasure in front of him to comfort our master's soul in heaven. That means master will lead us down the tomb. Great! Master. I've been with you for so many years. Finally... In this world, there is no Penglai Fairy Island. Only the cycle of justice. Retribution will always find you. Tomb raiding is a conscienceless act. Widowers, widows, orphans, the childless, the incapacitated, and the moneyless, short-lived, and hapless are all results of karma. I swore 20 years ago when I retired. It's been 20 years. What happened to your wife and Qing'er is not your fault. Stop! Huaiyi, go pack up with your junior sister. We'll go back to Fengtian as soon as it's light. Brother! See the guest out! Brother! This... Master, you... Father. Have some meat. Good girl, Qing'er. She remembers you like this. Father. I want a bamboo dragonfly. I'll make one for you later, okay? OK. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle, don't be angry. My master... That's his temper. Of course I know. I just can't accept the fact that Magu's treasure will be taken away by a scoundrel like Luo Manzi. Uncle, even if Luo Manzi really got the jade pillow, will he be able to find Magu's tomb? This jade pillow must be an important clue to Magu's tomb. That means if Luo Manzi loses the jade pillow, [General's Mansion] Check carefully. Hush. Don't come down now. Let me explore the way. We've changed shifts. What are you doing? Here. Coming. Hurry up! Rumor has it that you've got a precious treasure. Jesus. You foreigners are quite well-informed. How dare Luo Manzi collude with the Westerners? Do you know where I got this treasure? Where did you get it? That thing was not given by a human. The weasel is the matchmaker. Magu descends into the mortal world. Have you heard of it? I remember that day being July 15th of the lunar calendar. The fifteenth day of the seventh month. The rat welcomes the bride. Magu the jade lady has descended to the mortal world to gift you this jade pillow showing her sincerity. I thought it was just a dream. But when I woke up, There really was a damn pillow here! Hahaha! Well I haven't been able to sleep well since then. Because I've been dreaming Magu's tomb every night There amount of treasures in that tomb is unbelievable! So I kept thinking Is it because the fairy sensed something special from me so she did me a favour! He's obviously talking nonsense... Then, where's the jade pillow? Relax Here Cheers! She is already dead Why bother locking it still? Who's there? Who's inside? My goodness. This place is so creepy What are you afraid of? The marshal said its just a treasure given by the fairies You believe in that? It's obviously stolen from them! This is evil! What kind of treasure needs to be kept under a corpse? From where I've from, this called The Seven Soul Locks It's done to suppress evil items with evil itself! Okay stop talking! It's giving me goosebumps! Let's leave! Go Let's go Suppress evil with evil? What kind of weird trick is that? Tsk She's still locked up after she'd passed Poor thing. Just name your price How much do you want? Straight to the point! Well... Let's say... If I can get my hands on the treasure in the tomb and I give them all to you. What can you give me back in return? What would you like to have? You can have all the treasure. What I want is... the whole E'zhou. Marshal! Bad news! There's a thief! Marshal! Bad news! The... It's gone! What? Look for it now! Yes! Hurry up! Could it be that brother lost patience and stole it? Check this way! Affirmative. Hurry. Have you searched this area? Yes. Check the front. Keep your eyes peeled! Affirmative! Hey! It's me. Mu Qing! This way. Move! Climb over the wall. The wall is too high. What now? Quick! Step on my shoulder! No. I can't leave you! No way! I can't! Hurry! Brother! You careless fools! Over here! Kneel! Since when have I taught you do this! Master Well... This is not entirely their fault You see... it's my fault for spilling the beans Enough. The items here, return it back... to where you took it from Al- Alright. What are you doing? Master gave us a chance. Quick! Let's go Come on I'm not going. Luo Manzi had already colluded with the foreigners He wants to open up the tomb take all the treasure inside and trade them for weapons So that he can dominate and be the boss of E'Zhou I heard it with my own ears. Master. If he really does succeed, and start another war... How are the people living there going to survive the war? Master... you found me and brother... amongst a pile of dead people back then. But what about the kids there? Are they gonna be lucky enough to be saved like us? We'll just leave them to die like that? You want to rebel too? Really? Master, Although I'm not very capable myself But I can at least... tell if it's right or wrong. Although the emperor is gone, the treasures left by our ancestors still belongs to our descendants... Not for those foreigners! Everything in this world has its own destiny. Mind your own business. My junior. Yes? I'll leave the jade pillow to you. I'll go back to Fengtian tomorrow morning. Master. Also, if you two insist on staying here, then from now on... our master-disciple relationship ends here. Hmph. Master. Master! Brother. Now that we have the jade pillow, we are just one step away from your life-long dream. I've already said everything I had to 20 years ago. If you're willing you may join me to bring the jade pillow back to Fengtian and bury it with me Fulfilling my wish while also... prevent it from bringing harm to the world. Waiter, a pot of tea please. Oh no.-How dare you steal General Luo's treasure? The city is closed. I don't think you are aware... -Don't tell me...-of the surveilance that Lord Ma has! it's because of the jade pillow? Today, If we don't find what we're looking for... No one can leave the city.-It's OK. Be good. Isn't that Mr. Meng? What does it have to do with us? Officer, you wouldn't break your promise.... right? You said... if... we buy the pass... we'll be allowed to leave! I spent 20 dollars for that! Get lost! Nobody received your money! Everyone! we had already bought our passes! and we want leave the city! We want to leave the city! We want to go out! We want to leave! Folks! By what rights... Sir! Hahaha! Sir! Before we get our hands on the jade pillow There's only one way... for you to leave this place! Which is death! Hahahaha! Sir... [Pass] Father! Father! Father. Is this my gift? Qing'er... Qing'er! Qing'er! Master! Everyone listen up! Don't assume we can't find the treasure without the jade pillow! For the sake of the treasure... we'll blow up the whole mountain if we have to! Let's go! Hya! Hya! Huaiyi pass them all the money we have. But master... but if we give them all our money how are we going to go back to Fengtian? We're not going back anymore What? You fool! Master changed his mind! Master, I've been trying to open this Nine Lotus Lock for so long... how do you open it? The Nine Lotus Lock... is an imitation... of The Eight Diagrams of Manjusri Nine Palaces The eight locks corresponds to eight specific locations in Qimen Dunjia All eight locks must be opened in order to unlock the Nine Lotus Lock. Rest Live Hurt Restrict View Death Fear and open! Open all eight locks! A good lock can lock down rivers and mountains and imprison a majestic dragon [Memorial Tablet of the Grand Mentor] It was created for the lock and key craftsmen of the royal family our ancestors invented the Mound Finger Cot that allows us to open complicated locks with just our bare hands Now that the royal family is no more we're out here relying on this craft and steal from this tomb! Master wants both of you to follow him into the tomb! Really? Thank you, master! Great! The Iron Finger Zhang Poshan is back in business! Woohoo! Great! The water is clear as sun shines upon the land Open up the locks and the mountains ahead As the coffin of the prince's tomb sinks I'm the only one that dares to step in Hey, what are you carrying? Chief it's a corpse Alright go Greetings, Grandmaster. You both are the eighteenth generations of the Grand Commandant of the Locking Mountains. Grandmaster, Come out now. You're going down to the tomb to move all the treasures away from the tomb before Luo Manzi arrives so that the foreigners won't get them. We can't let Luo Manren's plan succeed for the sake of the people's safety Uncle, tell me about your previous experiences in the tomb I don't know much, Your grandmaster only taught your master the way to open up the tomb Oh... Master, You've been dealing with locks for your whole life, which kind of lock is the most difficult to open? The tomb lock is easy to open. The lock in our hearts, are difficult. The tomb lock is easy... Uncle, has Master been this serious since he was young? No... he wasn't. Then why does he treat everyone like they owed him money now? That's rude! What did you carve? Let me have a look. No! Come on! No! Give it to me. No! Master!-Give it to me. Hey. Does it look like master? Not at all. Master looks way better than that! That's because he didn't smile. Hey master, can you smile for a bit? Master, you can have this. I really hope that you will smile more often. Master will be smiling more if you stop making him mad at you! Hmph. By the way, Master, How far do we have to go still? It's still not time to go yet, you all should get some sleep. We'll depart at nine. Where is everyone? Master. Sister. Master. Sister! Don't look. Don't look. Huh? Miss! Miss! Did she jump into the river to commit suicide? Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Wake up! Wake up! Brother! You are really brave, aren't you! You really just slept on that! Master wants to leave now, let's go. Give me the jade pillow. Here, master. What? The stars on the ground are the same as the ones on the sky. The mountain peak came from the peak of stars Every dragon has its own name Over there. That star indicates the location of dragon's head. Master, this swamp is pretty huge, how are we gonna find it? If we can't find it, we can get some help. Junior, do you have the Yinfeng Powder? Yes. What is this? It reeks! For you, it smells terrible But for things in the swamp, it's a medicine that they'll die for. Alright, put it in. Sprinkle them all. This thing likes cold. When it's in heat, they will crawl into tombs. Follow it. So this is the Magu's statue. Hey. [Fairy Village] This place is strange. Normal villages face south. But it's the opposite. Master. This place is like a haunted house. It's foggy. Master. Seas change into mulberry fields and mulberry fields into seas. Master. Who are those people? They are not humans. Close your eyes. Life and death are regarded as unimportant. The path of immortality has appeared if you believe in Magu. Long live the Heaven and Earth. The sacrifice is held every ten years. Put the sacrificial offerings before the ancestors. Hold the knife with the golden bell. Take out the blood and fat of the sacrificed bull. Master. Can I open my eyes now? Ah. Master. Master! Help! Master! Master! Help me! Ah! Master. I thought I would never see you and Brother again. Wake up. Look down. What's going on? What you see is mirage. Those people who walked past are hallucinations, and they are not true? Brother. There's a vent over there. Okay. Let's go that way. Master. Why are there coffins on these boats? Get on the boat. Those people who scarifice used the ship here to transport the coffins to Magu's tomb. That's strange. Why is it only thundering and not raining? Look up. Why are there two moons? The coffin mountain has its own structure. It's cold inside and warm outside. The climate inside and outside the mountain forms strong convection. That's why there's such a phenomenon. This feng shui pattern is really rare. One hundred thousand thunderstorms in the dry season. Double moon illuminates the Dragon Pass. We're almost there. Master. There's nothing here. Maybe Magu's Tomb is under the lake? Master. I'm good at swimming. I'll go down and take a look. Go and explore the way. Don't get hurt. Be careful. Okay. Hey. Are you okay? I'm fine. Judging from your voice, you've been sick for more than a day or two. Let me check your pulse. Here. My Junior. Master. Master! Go away! Huaiyi! Master. Brother... Oh no. There's a siphon tide in the lake. Get into the coffin! Master, help me! Ah! Master. Brother. Uncle. Where are you? Master. Is that you? Master. Hang in there. I'll get you out of here. Master. What? Ah. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Brother! Sister! My foot. Brother! My foot. What should we do? We're surrounded. Huaiyi. Mu Qing. Master. Hurry! The insect repellent can't stop them for long. Hurry! Huaiyi! Hurry! Are you Okay, Huaiyi? I'm fine. Master. Master. What were those things just now? Why did they pounce on us at the first sight? These are blood spiders. They feed on human blood. It must be because the coffins are piled up in the coffin mountain and it's too humid here. That's why there are so many evil things. Master. Let's go. Ah! Ah! Master! Spiders! Master. Realgar. No wonder these poisonous insects dare not come in. Master. [Magu's Tomb] We really found it. We found it. Eh? What's that up front? The Clepsydra used for timekeeping. The craftsmanship is lost in the late Ming Dynasty. Timekeeping? For what? I'm afraid it's the time of the return tide of the siphon tide. But it shows that there are only two hours left. Oh. It means the siphen tide will return in two hours. Then will this place be flooded? All these bricks and tiles are fired from ceramics. Fires and water can't damage them. No wonder it's kept so well. Master. This must be Magu. Magu has become an immortal, but she didn't ascend into the heaven. Believers in the village built this temple. They have been guarding her mausoleum for generations. Then who is this woman? The sacrifice for the fairy. As a reward, Magu will give them endless lifespan and they can live forever. Brother. Let's go. Don't delay. My Junior, do you remember once we broke a vase of our master and were punished to kneel all night. Of course. I scared you with a centipede. But I broke the vase by accident. Yes. I remember that centipede was given to you by Master. It is said that if you separate the mother and its child, they will still gather together. The ancients smeared the blood of the child on money. No matter how far apart it is, the mother will find it. This is the story of centipedes' search for gold What are you trying to say? I just want to see the two centipedes our master gave you. I lost them long ago. Do you really want me to tell you plainly? I know my apprentices' kung fu very well. The General's Mansion is heavily guarded. [General's Mansion] They are like entering an unpeopled land.-They are over there. Wait for me at Chengnan Yizhuang at 9 p.m. You don't really care about Master's last wish. You're just suffering from tuberculosis. That's why you regard the legend of Magu's dream as a lifesaving straw. To live forever, you forced me out to help Luo Manzi find the tomb of the coffin mountain. Uncle. You really sided with Luo Manzi? Ha ha ha. Well. I really admire your skills. Attack! Don't move! Don't move! Ha ha ha. Since you have already known what happened here, Please fulfill my wish. What if I say no? Brother. What are you going to do? Then your disciples will suffer a lot. Mr. Zhang. We have limited time. We can't wait any longer. This should be where the jade pillow was placed. It seems that the jade pillow is the key to open the tomb door. Where is the jade pillow? He has it. Don't move. Uncle. General. Put it there. Old man. Put the jade pillow there. I asked you to put it there. Don't give him the jade pillow. If he drops it on purpose, the tomb gate won't open. If you mess up a sure thing, can you afford it? You are right. General. This is a good chance to make contributions. Do your best. Go. Ah! Help! General. Ha ha ha. Good! Good! Mr. Zhang. You deserve your reputation. Please. Let's go. Go! Be careful. Ah! What's going on? Open the door. You don't know. This is... This is the Six Secret Cursing Lock. Our master said it before. To set up six secret keys with Acalanatha's curse. Even if it is just a tiny mistake, the entire tomb will collapse because of it. So you do remember something. But do you remember that our Master once told us as long as we see the Six Secret Cursing Lock, we must give up immediately. Damn it! If you don't open the gate right now, I'll kill you! Master. Master, at this moment I have to do it. There's no way back for me. I have no choice but to break in. If you see this in heaven, please help me. Please help me. Now I activate the Static Curse of King of Ming! Arrive. Army. Fight. Here. All. Form. Line. Now. Forward. Is it working? If you can't open the door, I'll kill your disciple. Sister! Brother! There's light ahead. Go forward. Hahahaha. Hahahaha. I found it! I found it! Finally! Hahahaha. Pack all these treasures! They're all mine. Hahahaha. Go ahead! Master! Hahahaha. Hahahaha. So many treasures that can never be exhausted! Pack them! Be quick! They're all mine. Don't take them from me! Hahahaha. Pack them well. Hey, Old Man! Where are you heading? Pack them well. They're all mine. They're all mine. Hahahaha. Master has gone towards that direction. What are you doing? Put them down. Let's go. I am here now. I have found it. Old Man! Where are you going? Brother! I am here now. I have found it. Haha. You have overcome so many difficulties to get here. What do you want? I want... I want immortality. Since you and I have sort of connections, I shall give you the medicine. If you take it, You will be immortal in the day and extend your longevity to limitless. The Magic Lucid Ganoderma! The Magic Lucid Ganoderma! It is really here. Let go of me! You guessed right. I'm dying because of my serious illness. This ganoderma is the only thing that can cure my illness. Laogui! Ah! You... What are you? Brother! Don't go there. My illness can finally be cured. The Magic Lucid Ganoderma! The Magic Lucid Ganoderma! Hahaha. Master! Master! Laogui! Master! Watch out! Huaiyi, throw the smoke bomb! Master! Now! Ah! Master. Hurry up! I can't hold on any longer. Dad, the bamboo dragonflies you made are the best. Dad. Haha. Qing'er. Qing'er. Save this for your dad. Good girl, Qing'er. Dad, you're back. Dad. Do you really have to leave today? Tomorrow is her birthday. Don't go, please. This is the last time. I'll nerve do it again after this time. Please don't go, dad. Please. You promised to keep me accompany. I... I'll be back soon. I will bring you a gift when I am home. What gift will you bring me? Tomorrow, you will know what it is. Okay. Qing'er! Qing'er! Dad, mom was caught by the bad guys. They said that you are a grave robber. Dad, Is this my gift? I want... to play with you. Qing'er! Qing'er! Qing'er! Qing'er! Qing'er! Dad. Dad. Come here and play with us. Master. Wake up. Qing'er. Master! Master! It's all illusions. It's not true. Master. Master is not as ugly as this sculpture you made. That's because he was not smiling. Master, smile for us. Master! Wake up! Dad, come and stay here with me. No. Why? You don't like me anymore? Because I can't stay in the past forever. I want you to stay here forever. Forever! Forever! Forever! Ah! Ah! Master. Master. What happened here? Master. Where is the monster? There's no monster at all. From the moment we entered here, everything we saw was fake. Then... Where is my younger brother apprentice? Laogui! Ah! Uncle! You can do nothing to save me now, my brother. I am going to die soon. Uncle... Uncle. Old Man. What happened? What happened to him? The myristica fragrans use their pollen to make their prey have illusions. Laogui. Oh no! Master. The tree is spreading pollen again. My brother, instead of making us all die in an illusion together here, I... I'd rather die alone here. No! Burn this place! Hurry! Ah! Brother, didn't you say no matter... no matter what happens to me, you will help me? Please do me this favor for the last time. What should I do, brother? I broke our Master's favorite vase. Don't worry. No matter what happened, I will protect you. Really? You will help me? Master. Of course. You're always careless. So careless. My dear brother will help me. You should thank me later. Thank you, my brother. Let's go. Ah! How could this happen? Where is my gold? Where is my gold? What? Where's the gold? My gold! Where are my treasures? Where are my treasures? Where are them? Dig them out! Dig them out! Get them up. Get up! It's all fake! Stop! Let me tell you. There's no treasure here. It's all an illusion. What? How dare you lie to me? Leave now! Go! You can't go! Go! Go! Dig it out. Go! Go! Come back! Go! Come back! Come back! The treasure! Be careful. Master. Be careful. Ah. Ah. Nothing. Nothing is here. Where is my treasure? Where is it? Where is it? Why is there a hole in this coffin? Thank god, I'm good at swimming. Stop laughing. I thought there would be many rare treasures. I didn't expect that it was all fake. It's better than letting the foreigners win. Yes. By the way, Master, when will you teach me your iron finger? I will use the skills you taught me. to protect the relics in the tomb, so that they will not fall into the hands of foreigners. Let's wait until you can carve the wood well. Okay. Ah. Master, did you... Did you smile just now? I saw him smile. He smiled. Master smiled. Master. what were those things just now? Myristica fragrans? How can they grow that big? Yes. They are myristica fragrans. Their fruits can cause illusions. A small amount of absorption can help one feel calm. But if their pollen is swallowed in large amounts, people will have illusions. People from the Magu Village mistook this illusion for the goddess Magu's spirit and buried the dead with those myristica fragrans. The dark energy of the corpse has been nourishing the myristica fragrans for years. That is why they can grow this big. So this is the truth of immortality. The jade pillow is full of their fruits. The illusion not only fooled you but also fooled Luo Manzi and everyone else who wanted to find the treasures. The illusions made by myristica fragrans lure treasure hunters into Magu's tomb and turn them into food that fell into their trap.
