This time we will introduce Fukuoka's food stall &quot;El Bajon&quot;. This is a multinational food stall where you can enjoy cuisine from all over the world. A rich menu decorates the counter. The person working here is a young man who I introduced earlier on JKT. Jeff from France. He moved to Japan because he loves anime, and is currently training to become a stall owner. He is currently working at &quot;El Bajon&quot;. He makes galettes based on his mom's recipes. He spends his time surrounded by many people. In the world of &quot;once in a lifetime&quot; food stalls, his journey to dream has only just begun. This time I took a closer look at that day. Please watch till the end! . Tenjin, Chuo Ward, Fukuoka City. Hello! . long time no see! . This time I'd like to introduce Jeff, who is from France. He currently works at a food stall called &quot;El Bajon&quot;. He used to work at a food stall called ``Akachochin,'' but in the fall, he jumped into a new place to study. ``All the food stalls have their own individuality, and each one is different.'' For him, every day is a learning experience. The food stalls will be ready from 5:00 p.m. First, they begin by unloading a large amount of luggage. The stall next door is also being assembled. After unloading the luggage, the next step is to move the food stalls in. Next, they will set up the kitchen. The city is getting darker and darker. The counter side is ready. It's a cold enough day to wear a down coat, but Jeff looks hot. Preparations are progressing rapidly with skillful work. The stall preparations are complete. It looks like the neighbors are just getting ready. Business will start soon. JKT) Do you have a reservation? . Yes, you can make reservations here. You can make a reservation if you contact me through Instagram. I recognize his apron. JKT)Are you still using this apron? . yes! Boss's apron! . My apron! . The first customer has arrived. tortilla chips. Oden. El Bajon offers cuisine from around the world. Of course, Oden, a Japanese dish, is one of them. JKT) Do you always run the business with the owner? . that's right. Before I came, the owner had been doing it all by himself. I think it would be really hard if he was alone. He received an order for galette. This is Jeff's signature dish. Galette has been added to the menu since Jeff came. Jeff's mother's recipe has been inherited. Same recipe as mom. JKT) Beer? . Actually, I think Mom just wanted to drink. JKT) Meyers Lamb? . yes! . The flour used in Japan and France is completely different. The Japanese ones are extremely detailed.

I think mom's love will make this delicious. It will be completed soon and looks very delicious. JKT) Have you been eating it since you were a child? . oh yeah. There is a galette day once a year. Get together as a family and make a lot of crepes. For dessert, I eat it with "Nutella". It tastes like chocolate. It is a dish that brought back fond memories. JKT) Have you not returned to France? . I haven't come home yet. I haven't been back in five years. I've been in Japan for 5 years and haven't returned yet. My mothers came to see me around January of this year. For the wedding. I haven't meet her other than that. But for example yesterday. We played Mario Kart online until 3am in Japan. JKT) With your mother? . it was fun. JKT) There is a way to do that now. We can make normal phone calls, and we can also make video calls. We can also play games. My mom doesn't usually play games, but I think she made an effort to spend time with me. Customers started arriving gradually. The food stalls also become lively. I also sat at the counter and ate dinner. Mulled wine. The restaurant's popular menu item is &quot;jerk chicken.&quot; It smells really nice. good? . thank you. JKT) Delicious! .

The owner of El Bajon is a chef who travels around the world. He apparently traveled all over the world for his training. There are recipes for over 100 regional dishes from around 30 countries, and you can enjoy a variety of flavors depending on the season. For example, you can eat ramen after tapas and beer. This is a unique food stall that you won't find anywhere else in Fukuoka. It's really hot. I can't get enough of the garlic scent. JKT)Do you decide everything about the menu? . Yes, from my recipe book. I have the same recipes as the locals, so choose something delicious that I can make here. JKT) Did you go abroad to study cooking? . Yes, actually working.

Add yuzu pepper and ``Motsupon'' is completed. Here you are. It's &quot;Motsupon&quot;. The iron pot is hot, so be careful! . This looks really delicious. It will warm your body too. At first, we didn't have menu from Fukuoka. But tourists wouldn't be happy if that happened. JKT) Do customers really want to eat Fukuoka food? Yes, that's what I heard. It feels like it has increased a little. This is gratin. This is Jeff's recipe. French foods have been added to the original menu. When Jeff enters, this place will become the best food stall in Fukuoka. I think this is probably the best food stall in Fukuoka. Jeff does a lot of customer service. The number of repeat customers has increased considerably. After all, I can really feel that people are enjoying. Thank you! . I get embarrassed when I get compliments.

JKT) Have you known Jeff for a long time? yes. He's been here before. We even had drinks together. . I also heard that he was ending his contract with his previous stall. Until then, I had been doing alone. I was thinking that I would like to hire an employee soon. So I asked him, ``Would you like to work together?'' Where is your hometown? Canberra. Canberra! Do you know Canberra? Yeah Yeah I know. The owner speaks English, so many foreigners come here. There was a customer from Korea next to me. JKT) From Busan? .
