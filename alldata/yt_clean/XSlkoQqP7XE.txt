Shigesato Itoi is a talented hardworking But when night falls and he's all by himself Play RPGs Namely the Dragon Quest series And while playing such games Itoi would often imagine One free from the tired and overdone A game that takes place in modern America Where you play as an average kid who fights against aliens, highway signs, and hippies Itoi brought his novel idea to legendary game designer Shigeru Miyamoto But instead of 'you're hired!' Oh...I see... Miyamoto knew that the game could only be a success if Itoi put his full effort into its creation And with his multiple other jobs that just Itoi was so sad after being turned down by That he shed tears on the bullet train home However he wasn't about to give up And so he lessened his workload, called up Nintendo, and was granted a full team to begin work on his game Which later became known as Mother Our story follows a young boy named Ninten Our story follows a- Oh my G- Why are there so many Our story follows a young boy named Ninten as he journeys across America on a quest to unlock his psychic powers and save the world from an invading alien race ran by the evil Guy-goo er- Geeg? Listen it's pretty much Giygas Not long into his adventure Ninten gets teleported to a dream-like world called Magicant It's ruler, Queen Mary, has lost her memory and requests that Ninten find all eight parts to the song that she has forgotten Returning back to the real world, Ninten allies himself with two other children and one adult who ends up getting...uh... And after a long journey he manages Playing the full song to Queen Mary helps her to remember her past Mary is actually Maria Who along with her husband George For the purpose of nurturing a baby Giygas Maria often sang the eight melodies to baby Giygas Almost like its... Mother But George was not about that E.T. life and Later escaping back to Earth with the knowledge of PSI A century or so later The fully grown, Metwo lookin' Giygas Is told to destroy the Earth to keep the power of PSI Magicant turns out to actually be the physical representation of Maria's conciousness As the land fades from existence with her task of teaching Ninten the eight melodies finally complete Our three protagonists trek up Mount Itoi for the final confrontation against Giygas However none of their attacks have any effect None except for... singing That's right we're going full Disney Listening to the eight melodies brings back conflicting memories withing Giygas And he's forced to retreat back to space Promising to one day return Credits play Mother hit shelves in Japan and was an instant success Sparking an English localization team Which they renamed as Earth Bound Two words It took until the year 1991 for the English version to be finished and ready for release But with the SNES being the Combined with the unpopularity of RPGs in the U.S. Nintendo deemed the game unprofitable and scrapped the English release completely Unfortunately not the last time this happens On the bright side Mother 2 was already in production for the SNES And released just a few years later on the SNES woops Even receiving an English release along with some pretty horrible fart based advertisements Under the new name EarthBound One word A couple decades after the events of the previous game Giygas got over his mother complex and returned to destroy the Earth Thankfully one brave rhinoceros beetle managed to travel back in time to warn Ness the young boy prophesized to destroy Giygas And ask him to visit eight musical sanctuaries To record their melodies and become one with the Earth to unlock his full psychic powers Saying all the out loud I realize it sounds kind of insane but that's because... it is. It's a Mother game So Ness travels all along the world And assembling a team of three other children that also look suspiciously similar to the protagonists of the last game Well except for... Poo Yes his name is Poo don't laugh And along the way our party is constantly being stalked by Ness' next-door neighbor Porky Who is possilby being controlled by Giygas After collecting all eight melodies Ness becomes one with the planet and unlocks his full psychic powers Sensing his defeat, Giygas escapes to the past along with the Porkster To go hang out in a nice, cozy, intestine cave After a while, Giygas amasses so much power that he explodes into some kind of Rorschach inkblot test To reach Giygas in the past Ness, Paula, Poo (lol), and Jeff Transfer their souls into robots and travel back in time for the final battle Once again attacks have no effect Left with no better options Her prayers reach their family, friends, and you! As everyone's combined prayer does enough friendship love damage to destroy Giygas once and for all Porky rolls off to another era As Ness and friends return their souls back into their human flesh bodies The End ? Mother 2 was well recieved in Japan but its English counterpart... not so much Due to its shitty advertising, pun intended And its increase in cost due to being packaged with a thicc player guide the game ended up a commercial flop In an interview Myamoto once said, &quot;We had high hopes for Earthbound - in the U.S. - but it didn't do so well. We even did a T.V. commercial thinking 'Hey, this thing could sell three million copies!'&quot; How much did it sell? Seventy five... Thousand Oof Nevertheless, development began for Mother 3 and began, and began, and began again Nine years and multiple console swaps later Now I know a lot of avid Mother fans are going to get mad at me for spoiling the plot to this game So let me first say that Mother 3 is an amazing game and you should buy it and play it before watching this video Oh wait Thanks Nintendo Twins Clause and Lucas live with their mother Hinawa and cowboy father Flint in the peacefull village of Tazmily But don't get used to it Just north of town the Pigmask Army Yeah he's back unfortunately Are experimenting on the wildlife and turning them into ungodly hybrid abominations On the way back from visiting their Grandfather Claus, Lucas, and their mother have a cheap And Hinawa is forced to sacrifice herself News of Hinawas death reaches Flint Who goes crazy and attacks the villagers Claus steals one of Flint's knives and pursues the Mecha-Drago on a quest for revenge Flint eventually breaks out of jail and searches for Claus But finds no trace of his son remaining Distraught with grief, Flint dissapears from town Leaving Lucas all alone in an empty house ...Yeah, If you were ever wondering why Lucas always Well... now you know The story then shifts perspectives Who lives in Tazmily with his abusive father Wess And yes, every dad is a deadbeat in this series There's a reason it's called Mother and not like... Dadder ...or I guess Father, The two sneak into a haunted castle on a mission to steal the fabled Egg of Light Its here that they meet Kumatora, the least princesy princess of all video game princesses And the three suceed in obtaining the egg before being flushed down the castle drain Duster loses his memory and gets separated from the rest of the party Not knowing what the egg is or the fact that it actually contains everyone's collective memories from their past lives and the lost history of their civilization He decides to bury it underground The story then switches perspectives once again To a monkey who's being forced to dance for a merchant who's selling T.V.s to the people of Tazmily 3 years later Tazmily has gone full capitalism Anyone who doesn't own a T.V. has lightning routinely struck on their house By the Pigmen and their Thunder Tower As is the case with our young hero Lucas Who decides he's done with all that shit Where Kumatora now works and The three convince Duster to take off his wig and bring them to the egg's resting spot Where, after touching the egg, Oh yeah i'm not sure if I made it clear or not But Boney is a permenant party member So don't let his dog-like appearance fool you Afterwards the party heads to the Thunder Tower Leading to a brief encounter Ooo, who could it be? WAIT it's backstory time Remember the last two games? Well everyone died The world ended and humanities last survivors took a boat to the last safe place on Earth A group of islands resting on the back of a giant dragon To keep themselves from destroy the Earth again And chose to live the humble amish lifestyle Eventually the dragon got mad And so seven fabulous men called the Magypsies had to seal him away with the seven needles Meanwhile, after flip-floppin through time, Porky arrived on these islands and heard the legend that Whoever pulls the seven needles will unleash the dragon and either destroy the world or save it depending on the pureness of their heart He brainwashes a bunch of people And makes plans to assemble all of the islands inhabitants into New Pork City For one last party before Claus - I mean - Will pull the final needle and unleash the dragon Lucas and the Masked Man race against eachother to pull the most needles and have control over the dragon The score is 3-3 and it's all tied up with the final needle being hidden underneath New Pork City As our heroes arrive on the scene Who has become an immortal manbaby After his defeat, Porky locks himself away within his Absolutely Safe Capsule Where he can never be harmed, but in turn, Billions of years from now Porky will still be living out his eternal existence in the absolute safety of his capsule Floating around aimlessly in space A poetic end... In some way Our party continues onward to where the Masked Man is waiting to pull the final needle Lucas being equipped with the Franklin Badge is the only one who can withstand his powerful lightning attacks And so it becomes a 1-on-1 duel Having already realized the Masked Man's identity, But the same can't be said for his opponent Somehow, from beyond the grave, As she pleads with Claus to stop hurting his brother Claus comes to his senses and removes his helmet But after all hes been through, the grief, the anguish, As he suddenly fires one last lightning bolt Dealing fatal damage With his final words Claus promises Lucas As he passes on to the afterlife... ...where his mother is waiting for him Right after experiencing just about the most traumatic thing a young boy could imagine Lucas is left with no other option and pass his emotions onto the dragon His feelings are received as the ground begins to shake Earthquakes split the land Destroying the islands completely The End Yes I said 'The End' There's an additional scene where it confirms that everyone ended up ok But it's up to interpretation where, or more importantly how they actually survived Could be on a completely new island It's never explained so your guess is as good as mine Well it got pretty sad at the end there huh I should probably say something to lighten the mood Uhh... Ness and Lucas got into Smash Brothers, Mother 1 finally released in English 25 years later, Mother 3 still hasn't released outside of Japan! - Wait, that's bad, that's bad, that's bad Shit...uhh You know what?
