Somebody tries to shoot me in the back, You defend yourself almost too well, mister. They're both dead as doornails. They came in the window. OK, OK, self-defence, I guess. But in this town we don't like violence. I'm asking you to get out of town Good morning, Bill. - A couple. I want to have a little talk with you. What brings you all the way out here?

Did you think How much did you give those two I don't understand. It doesn't make much difference. I should kill you. Or maybe I have learned something As an example, even a rat like you can be worth more alive than dead. I know it was not a nice trick No, no, no. You didn't walk out on me, you sold me. It was a long time ago. Here. Here's 100 dollars. I know it's not much, - 100 dollars? 100 dollars for 15 years in jail?

This time you got something to learn, too. Oh? What? Cavanaugh's paying me 500 dollars - Another bad investment. - Maybe I didn't take him seriously. But tell me, why does he want you killed? You ask too many questions. I can pay for the information with his 500. He's worth more than that to me. 15,000. So I suggest you keep your distance. 'Cause if you don't, I might get mad. That's a warning. I'll find out who he is. ...get ready to get mad. GENERAL MERCHANDISE Hey! Hey, wait a second. Wait. I wanna thank you. Yes, sir.

Walcott, a stranger's asking for you. Show him in, then. Easy, friend. You're all alike. Years go by and you all do the same things. Gun in the drawer, knife in the back. Lies. You were afraid that I wouldn't receive you? Quite the contrary. I expected you to receive me too well. So I figured it's safer Walcott, that stranger's gone. I'm already here, friend. Close the door behind you. The door! Well... looks like we've become important. And rich. You've changed your old clothes, But you still haven't been able You still got the meanest-looking face - Now listen, Ryan... And I can tell you where I've been I've seen some mean faces. Plenty of them. Things aren't the same as they used to be. Because I can pay now. Just sit down. We'll talk about it. There isn't that much talking to do. Just five words. Fifteen thousand plus fifteen thousand. 15,000 bucks doubled? A lot of money, Ryan. But not for 15 years in jail. He was killed right under my nose and I'll give you an advance now. All right. The rest tomorrow. Now it's my turn. All right? Hold it. Don't kill him yet. He's useful to us for the time being. We could finish you off now. Let me tell you this, boys. Good old Ryan is going to be helpful to us Wait. I've been working at this for years, the citizens as well as But the most important thing is I have The funds the state deposited with me What do you think? Should I build with this mountain of dollars? They don't think I should. I guess I'll have to go You make sure you don't lose him. - Mr Walcott. - Some extra work? WALCOTT BANKERS - Who's there? Good evening, Mr Walcott. - My God, look at that. THREE CHEERS FOR SEN CARLYLE Untie him. Throw him out. - Let me get through here. He was with me for ten years. A loyal man, a good worker. And a friend. They killed the other guard - They didn't leave a penny. Hey, they caught one! Hey, they got one! Hang him! All right, out of the way. Let them through. I recognise this one. He robbed the bank, he and his men. Calm down! Take it easy! Killers and thieves don't have any rights. Calm down! Don't you worry. He'll be hanged. But first he's gonna tell us Walcott, don't you wanna Listen to me! Give me some time, The sheriff's idea is good. I lost my temper for a moment, Don't worry, he's going to be hanged. Put him in the jail. - On your horses. Let's go. Whoa! The prisoner escaped. This is your fault. You were against us. Now this man is a danger for us all. You're gonna pay if you fail. Let's go, men. I'll go back to Lyndon City. What do you say, Grandpa? - You'd be making a mistake, as usual. Lyndon City's all excited right now. You get recognised, And Walcott isn't there any more. What makes you think so? I'm in the habit of using my head. Walcott had a good plan. Now, with me free, he's had to go and give up playing - Which way you think he's headed? Which is? After criss-crossing their tracks they went to El Viento. That's a village in Mexican territory. Boy, you really know everything, Except that now you'll stay here quietly. You can go ahead and finish your shave. This time I get there before you do. Course, I'll leave you on foot, Except I won't leave your horse Don't you wanna try some of this meat? I'll see you around, Grandpa. Bill! I was thinking. I'd like to have had a son like you. 'Cause someday I'm gonna Ah, forget it. Get out of here. Might need that. I'm thirsty. Why did they run away when they saw me? What are you afraid of? You... you aren't with the others? I'm on your side. - Run away. Please. They'll kill you. Before anybody kills me, And I don't think I'll give it to 'em. Glad to see me, eh? I figured you were worried about me. Kiss me, little one. &quot;She's grown up, she's a woman now.&quot; Was I right? Are you a woman now? You dirty little... You. Who are you? Someone who takes his anger out on men. What are you trying to say? That I'm afraid? You've got a stupid face, but you get it. Come on, hero. Something the matter? Yeah. I've decided to kill you. Unlatch your pistol. The other hand. Remember 15 years ago at the Mesita ranch That woman happened to be my mother. I want to deliver him alive to Pedro. He ought to revenge his own brother. OK. All right, let's roll it. Watch out. You stay here. Whatever happens, Where is Paco? I asked you where my brother was! Who did it? Who? We have him, Pedro. Alive. You rotten murderer. You rotten murderer! You killed my brother! Murderer! - We must find out who he is. Well, that's interesting. Then you're tied up with Ryan. As his pal, you must know Men, prepare a deep hole outside. I'll make you talk, boy. Be sure of it. Because we are very interested And my men want to surprise Ryan. Talk. Do you want to finish your life Or chewed up by ants? It would be a shame for it to end If I talk, who'll stand good for my life? Tell me where Mr Ryan is Pedro will kill you in a regular duel. Do you agree? All right, then. Ryan thought you wouldn't be back yet. He headed for Redstone Pass to meet friends And when is he supposed to Today. Redstone Pass is 20 miles from here. We better be on our way. For your sake, I hope you told us the truth. Bring him outside. This is gonna be fun! All right. - All right, shovel it in. That's better. Go on. I see you're a man of your word. We should be back in ten hours. But you'll probably think it's longer, The honour of serving the salt... is yours. Let's get going. - Let's see them. Hey, look. What's that? Hombre, what are you doing here? You better stop there. You had to get here Idiot. Are you on your way in or out of that hole? You remind me of a groundhog Now, let's see. I'll just leave you there for a while. Hey... stop joking around, Here, don't give him too much. Or too fast. Give me that, please. Here. Please. Senor, I don't know who you are, but I feel you were sent by God to help us Actually, I don't think I'm in that close And I don't recall But I am here for personal reasons I think you've invented some tall tale - Yeah. Eight or nine hours. That gives us time All you men, listen to me. I want it this wide and this deep. Fill it with dried branches Then stand by with your barrels of oil. It must be done within a few hours. Now go! - Is there a safe place for the women? Take them there. Pour that over there. Go there. I guess Ryan is at El Viento and that he's had enough time - How do we fight him? You take the others through the front. - Come. Here they come! You should've knocked first. They'll leave us alone. For tonight. The night is going to be long for them, A little music might soothe them. It's an old Mexican custom. They play you a funeral march But don't listen to it. Go to sleep, son. You gotta be well rested tomorrow. That's good. We'd better get to them We've no time to lose, men. Ah, good morning. I hope. You were there, too. There weren't four, there were five of us. When I saw what was happening, All I could do was save a child All right. I've been waiting for that. But let me help you first. There's too many of them When it's over... ...I won't run away. Manuel. Pedro. Out the back! Before you fire again, How many bullets you got? Three. This time I'm out. I can see that. Turn around, Ryan. Defend yourself! Turn around, Ryan! Turn around, Ryan! Thanks for leaving me my horse. Good luck, son. THE END
