I might end up spending a lot of money in this video and I'm not excited about it. So here's the thing about Minecraft. Mods on Java Edition can be kinda finicky. They can only really be applied to the specific version of Minecraft that they were created for. For example, there's mods that are only created for 1.20 and that means that any mods that were made for 1.16 aren't compatible, you can't run them together. Additionally, there's multiple mod loaders. Off the top of my head, I know of Fabric, Quill, Forge, and Neo Forge, all of which have their own set of quirks and capabilities and some of which are even compatible with mods from the other loaders and so that just kinda adds to the confusion. Plus the names, Forge and Neo Forge. They're the same, they ain't right? Are they the same? All this can sometimes make it really difficult to create a mod pack with everything you want just since some mods don't work together. Like Sodium, I can only run Sodium on Fabric but I think it also runs on Quilt. Maybe there's a version for Quilt but I also don't know but you can't run it on Forge because there's a different version of it for Forge but it has the same capability. So here's why I'm on Bedrock Edition today. Minecraft released a feature a while back called Add-ons that are essentially just mods but for Bedrock Edition and they recently added the ability to download them from the Minecraft Marketplace. For example, this is the official 15th anniversary Add-on that they released alongside their 15th anniversary map and it adds a few fun things to the game like this confetti shooter, all just in game. Say what you will about the pricing but the craziest thing to me is that all of Bedrock's Add-ons are compatible with each other and in theory, there's no limit to how many you can have in one world, just your hard drive size and I've got plenty of that. So today I posted on my community tab asking for your favorite Minecraft Bedrock Add-ons so I can add all of them to one single world and see what kind of chaos unfolds. - Your data, baby, baby, baby. - I can't see what those are. - I'm really hoping for a crash. I definitely think we can do it. - How many Add-ons? There's too many Add-ons. - This many. I'm gonna be getting all my Add-ons today through the Minecraft Marketplace just for the sake of being able to add up the prices but there's also a lot of great Add-on content on other platforms that you can also check out. Curseforge and Planet Minecraft, I know both have Add-on sections of their sites so there's a ton to offer. Just download them at your own risk, they're a third party saying. So let's get started. Morph Gauntlet. I was so hoping you'd say that. I've actually already bought this one but I do think we should keep track of how expensive this world is gonna be to make in the end. This Morph Gauntlet Add-on is worth 830 coins in the shop so we'll add that into the tally and calculate the final price of the coins at the end of all of this. But what does it actually add? Well, it allows you to morph into all Minecraft mobs which I was actually really excited about because look at these screenshots. This could be awesome. It also looks pretty customizable, like the ability to use the abilities or hide name tags and that kind of a thing but I think it is just limited to all Minecraft mobs so if we add mobs later on, which we might, we might not be able to use them with the Morph Gauntlet but that's okay, this is still gonna be awesome. Lots of funny bits to be had and that's what I'm excited about. Great suggestion, that's going in. The 15th anniversary Add-on would be cool. It would, we've already seen it in the intro and fun fact, it's free. Which I love because I'm not spending money. So this is a pretty much a no-brainer. It's adding a bunch of cool stuff and I think we should totally throw this in there. All of these are linked in the description by the way. If you wanna check any of these Add-ons out, they're all down there. You could just also search them on the marketplace. They're all there. More TNT. Oh, thank goodness, another free one. We'll see how long this streak of free ones lasts. I've also actually already claimed this one, it looks like. So that's cool. You know me, we won't be a Knarfy video without some chaos like this. Sweet, adding that into the pack and adding nothing to the tally. That's a good combo. The Add-on that adds armor trims for weapons. Oh boy, here we go. 830 mine coins. Go ahead and add it to the tally. Five bucks for some pretty nice tools that we might not even remember to make. Nice, that feels worth it. It definitely could be cool though. So I'll add it to the list. And now I need to actually buy it. Oh boy, here we go. Hiker's friend. It's got a ton of really easy to get stuff that's really great early game. Nice, yeah, this one's also free. I've claimed this one before. This one's cool, I like this one. I'm excited to see what this has to offer. I also haven't played with this one. So there's a lot of custom stuff here that could be really cool. A lot of extra items, seems really solid. We're gonna check it out. I like the elemental crops one and Hiker's best friend. Well, we already got Hiker's best friend. We just talked about that one, were you listening? But elemental crops, oh boy. 310, oh boy. Go ahead and add it to the tally. I'm just gonna get it. This one does seem pretty interesting, but there's not really any other information other than this image up here on top and this little explanation. Saying you're embarking on the ultimate farming adventure. Okay. Harness the elemental forces of Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, and Ender. Scattered across the world. I was on board with all of these because that's all of the Avatar, the Last Airbender series ones, and then there's Ender. Forge unique armors with specialized abilities. Use essence to craft coveted items like Blaze Rods. Okay, this might have more than I think. This is gonna be interesting. I still have no idea what we're getting into, but we'll find out. Naturalist add-on adds a whole bunch of adorable animals. Naturalist, see, I've actually heard about Naturalist as sort of a mod in general. I think it's a Java mod originally, and this adds a lot! 100 animals and types. That's gonna be interesting, but we are- We're paying a premium. Add 1,340 coins to the tally. To be fair though, I think I'm getting what I'm paying for because this does look really good, and I think there's a lot of things that we can do with this. I also kinda hope it works with the Morph Gauntlet, but I don't think it will, but we'll find out. Let me just purchase this because now I don't have enough mine coins. I can feel the money draining from my account. The Subscribe add-on. Man, that's the best one out of all of them. That's my favorite. That's my favorite add-on of all time. The totally, totally real comment told me about. Totally real. Good thing it's free. I can't remember what it's called, but there's an add-on that lets you place really cool secret doors. It could literally be called secret doors. What do you think, bub? Should we get this secret doors add-on? (laughing) He's so-- You're so squirmy. Why are you so squirmy? Why don't you just sit? What's that? That's so cool, huh? Well, when I searched the secret door add-on, I found this one. Add another 830 coins to the tally. That's $5 out of my pocket. This does look kinda cool though. I'm not gonna lie. This would be really fun to add on a server of some sort. Good suggestion. My wallet hurts. Tinker's Construct by FTB. It's on the marketplace and it's very impressive. Okay, see this one I'm torn about because on one hand, it's 990 coins. On the other hand, this is actually like a genuinely really cool thing that I think a lot of Java players will recognize because it's like an impressive mod. So part of me is like, it's probably fine that I'm spending $6 on 15 quintillion different weapon and tool combos. So I'm also like, that's a $6 add-on. This is racking up real quick. What's the tally at right now? Not great. That's what it's at right now. I love the Dragonfire light add-on and there's a free version in the marketplace. Huh, free? Don't mind if I do. Oh, I guess I already have this one. I guess since it was free, I probably just grabbed it. This looks really sick, but there is a full version that's 830. I'm not gonna buy this one. So we're not gonna put that on the tally because I think the only difference is that there's 21 dragons in this one and only eight dragons in this one. Yeah, so there's a difference but three is better than $5. So I'm happy. This one should be cool though. That'll be a fun one to add. Poisonous potato add-on. Another free one that I got when the April Fool's update came out. This one's fun. This is an actual like Minecraft styled one based on the April Fool's update on Java edition. It's pretty cool. This one adds. Apparently it's completely different stuff from the Java edition version. So we'll see. More pets. The only real one I can think of is the Spark Pets one which the base version of it I think is free. But since you said more pets, I'm kind of thinking you meant this one which is another $6. I kind of want the premium one. It looks really cute. So I'm like, man, I could have bought like groceries. Who am I kidding? Groceries are too expensive nowadays. All right, add the 990 to the tally. Grappling hooks by Yegs. Oh, this one looks great. This one looks so fun. Oh dude. Okay, this one's gotta be worth it. Look at this. Farming hook, block hook, instant hook, mining hook, grappling hook, diamond hook, explosive hook, explosive hook. Okay, we're getting this one. Ah, man. 490, add it to the tally, go. That sounds like a lot of fun. Crafty companies. Well, it's actually called Crafty Companion add-on but I'm following ya, don't worry. I was actually kind of fascinated with this one when it came out. So I'm kind of excited to see how it works in game. It could be a really wild experience having, you know, the YouTuber Crafty just hanging out. the YouTuber Crafty just hanging out. He's just gonna hang alongside for the ride. It's gonna be a great time. Another 990, add it to the tally. Planes. That single word just cost me 1170 mine coins. What have you done? This is a $7 add-on, but it adds planes. This does look kind of cool. I really hope it's worth it. Oh my gosh, there's so many. Color trai-- CRASH?? Oh, okay. Well, if there's crashing. $7 is more than worth it. Man, am I even gonna be able to do all these things in the video? We're gonna find out. Jeez. Mutant mod. You mean, this one? The only one that shows up when I search mutant? All right, well, I guess this one's goin' in too. Add another 830 to the tally. All right, I need to stop. Oh boy, that was a full 16 add-ons that I just got for this world and I have no idea how this is gonna go. I did the math and in total, this cost me 9,600 coins. And here's a little bit more math. If $5 is 830 coins, which there's a little bit of estimating there, don't worry, then this world cost me about $57.83. What the heck, man? This better be worth it. So with that, let's jump into the world and see what kind of absurd features I just bought. Oh boy. - We're doing a bad app, bad app. I can't see with those glasses - Every add-on, one world. - Every add-on. - Knarfy, it's 89 megabytes. It's a lot of megabytes. It is downloading packs, three of 11. It is stuck on three. So I guess we know what happens when you add them to one world. - It doesn't work. Thanks for watching. - Thanks for watching. I think what it's doing is it detects that I'm not, I didn't buy any of these and so it's like, oh, okay, all right. - You're not supposed to be here. - Jeb is gonna show up to my door. - Jeb!? - There's a giant chicken that I don't know what to do. - There's a giant chicken and I don't know what to do. I'm gonna join the world and I'ma beat it with you. - That isn't the goal of this video, but I appreciate the effort. - I could put my hands like this and wait, okay, the editor, your editor's gonna hate me. I'm gonna do this and you could technically put Knarfy's eyes in between each thing, which is kind of weird looking. - Oh god it hurts! Oh it hurts! - Yo, you got a nice big book there. - I'm not in here, oh, hey! - Hey! - Check out this gigantic book. Where the, what the? - Sparks Universe, let's go. - Oh, grappling hooks guide. - I like the read. - Okay, yeah, how's yours? Here's a few more, actually. - Where's it going? - Oh. - Who is that? - Yeah. - Oh, is that the big chicken? - Dude. - Yeah, yeah, it's kinda crazy. - What's up, man? - Welcome to the realm. - There's too many add-ons on this world, for the record. Also, Crafty's here. - Dude, we're gonna be the best Minecraft buddies. - Can you just get rid of him? - Ouch Ow Ouch. - Stop it. - Get rid of him. - Ouch. - o way. - The real crafteeeeee - Parker Collins. - Hey, man. - This world has 16 different add-ons on it. And our goal right now is to, okay, hi pal, hey man. We have a lot of add-ons. Our goal is to see if we can use a little bit of each one. And then we have to decide if this was worth the 70 freaking dollars that this entire thing is set up. - I'm gonna go and tell ya. It was definitely worth the money. It was definitely worth the money. - Well, that's what we're gonna find out if it really was and if you're lying to me. All right. - Hey, watch out, Crafty's following you. - Yeah, Crafty's my friend now. I've got a new YouTuber partner. Sorry, see you later. - Oh, yeah? - Crafty and I are gonna go-- - It's okay, well, this is gonna be my partner. ...millions of views on every video now. Bye. - Yo. - Wait, I can't-- - Bro's jamming. - Okay, bro's jamming. - If he's gonna be your friend, then hang on. You pick the best dancer. - All right, Crafty, let's go. It's okay, it's all good. Because I will probably be leaving him behind when I have my, wait. - I'll get rid of them, don't worry. It's okay. - All right. - Come on, oh, jeez. I'm gonna see you guys later. I'm gonna be in the skies. That's right. - What in the world is that? - See you later. - Woo! - No! - Woo! Bye! - Well Craftee, we've been left behind. - This is really slow. Here we go, wait, I'm comin' back. I'm comin' back. - Don't worry, I'll fly. - It's okay. I can keep up. Your jet is not faster than me. - I don't know what you're talking about. This is a crazy good, uh-oh. - Oh, my God. - What is happening? - Okay, well. - Knarfy doesn't know how to fly. - Hey, well done. - I'm just kidding. See you later. - Come back, no. Not the chicken. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. (laughing) - The chicken is attacking it. - Hey, you stop that bad chicken. Get him, get him. - Oh, my gosh. - I'm hiding behind this grass. - What is happening? - Oh, my God. - He's going. He's got a bow. - Go, Crafty, go. You can do it. - Crafty's just taking the fire right now. - I'm down, I'm down. - Ah, RIP. - He's just gonna take a nap now. All right, take a break. Okay, he's. - I'm gonna beat him up. - All right, I picked up Crafty. You're my new YouTube friend again. - Yay. - Oh, yeah, this guy's so. - So the morph gauntlet, I don't think works on anything other than vanilla mob- You got it. Oh, my gosh. - Dang straight, I did. - How does this work? I don't know how this- - Let's see. Oh, I got bad news. I don't get to become that. I can be a human, though. - Were you not a human? - I'm gonna go get the sheep. I'll see you later. - Oh, okay. - Oh, hey. Bah. - Hey, man. How's it going? It's me, the sheep. - There is a very high def dog coming towards you right now. - Oh, my gosh. - Oh, I can't punch you over there. - Elemental crops, Essence, Earth Element, back. - Knarfy, you really brought me, I can't click away now. You really brought me into this world. Wait, I got something. What is this? - You know, I'm not gonna lie, I don't know. Oh, okay, all right. I'm just a sheep man. I don't know what to- - Run, boy, run boy! - Plane, plane. - No, you don't. - Oh, no, you don't. - My plane. - Hey, Knarfy. - Hey. - Catch. - Okay! - Okay, you know what I think we should do? I think- Ope We should try to build one cohesive building with like a little bit of each feature. - Okay, well, here's one. This is how we start it. - All right, Crafty's the first one. - Yeah, he is the first. I'm gonna have him just like give me-- - All right, dude. Can you find this? - Eight. - What's that? - Spider Eyes. - I'm sorry, Knarfy. We gotta go do this real quick. - Oh, okay, all right. Well, you have fun. I'm gonna go build. - Hey, I got the spider eye. Where'd he go? Oh, there he is. - Happy 15th anniversary. - Let's go. - Oh. I have a great plan. - Oh, that's a big book. That's a-- - Stop, stop, you can't read my book. What are you doing, man? - Oh, I'm sorry. My journal, dear journal. Knarfy likes to read my stuff and honestly, I don't think I can trust him because he's, it's like he's getting closer every time I turn and look over there. It's kind of freaking me out. Let me see where he is. Whoa. What is happening? - What the, what is going on? - What are you doing? - Stop. - What the heck? - Stop. - What? (laughing) - Bro just conjured a helicopter out of a book. - What? - I'll see you later. I'll see you later. - Oh, oh. - Oh, oh, I, I, uh. Sorry, give me-- - Okay, all right. - Hold, please. - Yeah, hold, please. - There he goes. There he goes. Oh, oh. - I don't, I don't know how to. - You got this. - Uh, uh. I'm just hovering. (SCREAMING) - What? - What is that? - Pick me up, pick me up. - Interact - Pick me up. - Yeah, man. - Oh, I got him! - Oh my God. - Yo! - Oh, I just got out of the plane and now I, what? - What? - Oh, what? - I got out of the helicopter. - Knarfy? - What is going on? - This is my, my goth inspired house that is totally, is totally a real style. You like it? - Wait Knarfy. Knarfy. Wait, wait. What does that guy have? - I saw that earlier. Go look. - What's in his hand? - Oh, oh God. - That's a good thing I'm in creative mode. - Is that a fork gun? - Wee. - What do you have, hey, is this grappling hook? - Whoa. - Why does this guy have a full blown, it's like a dragon. - Oh, it's not working. - Hey, let's kill this guy and take his dragon. - Good luck. I'm gonna keep building my house actually. I think it, I think it. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - We gotta build a house for the dragon, of course. - That's exactly what we got. Oh, I got it. Oh, let's go. - Yeah, boy, eat the villager. Get him. - Yeah. I got this polar bear for you to eat. - Oh, hold on. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, he flies. - I'm off to see Netherland. I'll see you later, Knarfy. - Whoa, wait, hold on. - There's a way cooler dragon right here. - What? - Nuh uh - Okay, ha, look at my cool dragon. - Oh, no fair. Hahaaa. At least you can't catch my dragon. - Dude, look, Knarfy, someone's building a dumb house down there. - Oh, yeah, that guy's real dumb. That's real dumb. - Yeah, I got a surprise for ya. - Uh-huh. - Oh, jeez, that's horrifying. Wait, wait, no, wait. - Bon voyage, Knarfy-san. - What is this? Why is this? What, is this a freaking leopard? This is a tiger? That's not it. - I can feel the wind. I can feel the wind in my face. You know what I need? I need some glasses. - Let's go, dragon. Oh, wait, you know what? - I'm gonna go keep building my-- - Let's do this. - SystemZee becoming SystemZee. No way. - Oh, God, it won't stick. - I tried, but it doesn't work. I got your, I got your, hello? Why does your house look like it's gonna take me to the back rooms? - I don't know. - What? What? One more time, please. Oh. (laughing) Hello? Good thing that's not openable by other players, so. We need to get to the root of this. Don't mind me, just. Oh, I can see you. - That sucks. Yeah, that one's really not the best because it's totally not secret at all. - You can just see. Wait, oh, continue. Wait, this is so cool. Wait, that's so sick. Oh my gosh. - Let's go. - That's so cool. - If we just do this, and like go down this. Can't continue. Boom, secret base. Woah a remote. What does the remote do? I got a remote. Whoa, that's so weird. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - Knarfy! Hey! - Hey, where'd he go? - I'm trying to see. - Hey, wait, wait, wait. I hope this doesn't cactus fall AHHHHH Oh boy, it's a great day to chop a tree. Three by three bookshelf. Why does it look like that? - This is gonna be drip stone blocks. - What the heck? You know what? It's part of the house now. So, oh, I got it. I got it. I got the perfect furniture for us. - You know what else we need is an elevator. - Yeah, block of mummified scales? - Not that great. - Well that's creepy. - Like my pile of mummified scales. That's a lot of pi- Oh? - Whoa. - I'm gonna dig a hole real quick. - Okay, yeah, you know what I just realized we have. - Yeah. - A lot of explosives. - Hang on, wait, wait, wait. Before you do that, I gotta sit down real quick and get a mummified pop. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, of course. - I'm watching the secret cameras right now. - Hey man, hey, guess what? Take this, enjoy. Let's see what happens. - It's like a blaze. - Wow. - Disco TNT. - Disco TNT. - Yo. - Yo. - It's a boogie bomb. Come down here. - Into the secrets. - And then just close the. - I'm digging this. - What does that look like? - What the heck are you wearing? I'm like, whoa. - Don't mess with me and mittens. - I'm sorry. - You know what it feels like? I feel like we went on Craigslist. - Yeah, we just kind of ordered whatever was there. - Hang on. - What the? - Wow. - I see my ingot. - Wow. - Wow. - Wow. - He's puffy. - Wow. - They're so cute. - This feels like when I added pets into Minecraft is what it feels like. - Wow. - There's so many weapons and I got a test them all. - Whoa. - Wow. - Oh no. - Whoa. - Whoa. - Whoa. - Whoa. - Whoa. - Whoa. - It's okay, I got a confetti cannon. - Whoa. - Look, look at my feet. - Yeah, buddy. - Nice. - How did you do that? - Hey. - How is this possible? - Welcome to green bean island. - Cool hot tob! - Can I get you anything? - Hot tob. - Hot top. - Whoa. - Bubble wand. - Bubbles? - Bubbles! - Whoa. - Yeah, let's mix all of them. - Ender slime. - Woah! - Woah! - Woah! - Let's go. - Woah! - What the heck? What is this? Terra cube? - I feel like I'm kind of losing brain cells actively. Hang on. - Whoa. - Whoa. - Wew. - Whoa. - Whoa. - Whoa? - WOAH - Look what I have. - You know, not that impressive. - Look what I have. - Whoa, it's, wait, it's a, it's called a mace. - No, wait, no way. - These add-ons are getting crazy these days. - Wow, that's a crazy add-on. No way! - These add-ons are getting crazy, man. - Wow, bro, that's a crazy. - Ah. - Hello? Hey, Knarfy, I found some sewage. - Oh. - Knarfy, you didn't install a bathroom. I apologize. Okay. - Oh, that's what that was. - Bubble machine. - Bubble. - Bubble machine. - Look at it. - Yay. - Wait, you know what we need? The ultimate dance party. Can we face them upwards? Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute. I have an idea. Let's go. - Yeah. - Whoa. How many add-ons? There's too many add-ons. - Oh, this many. - I think we're getting ready to break that. - I think we're getting there, yeah. We're definitely getting to that point. - Well, you know what this party needs? - What does it need? - A snake. Bring out the snakes! - Bring out the snakes. - Knarfy, there's a lot, but not enough. (laughs) My brain is going about as fast as my frames. When they invite you to Knarfy's party and you're tired. - Yup, yeah. - This is what happens when you invite Craftee to Minecraft. - Secret doors, that's for sure. That's some dynamite. Naturalists, we saw some creat- There's a duck. - Where is the, what? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's go. - Whoa, whoa. - Let's go. - Whoa. - I gotta admit, there's something really great about this poisonous potato thing because it has a steering wheel. - Okay, let me parallel park. - You got this, you got this. - Oh shoot, it's flooding. Oh God, sorry. This thing has like at least three horsepower. - Oh geez. - And boom. - Oh my gosh, this thing is actually kind of, wow. - I did it. It's fast, right? - Yeah. - There's this. - That's a Minecraft feature. - oh. - I don't play Minecraft that much. - Wait, I'm literally stuck in the camera right now. I cannot escape it. - Hey. - Hey. - Can you break them for me? - Wait, if you break it since I can't escape, does that put me in, am I about to be put? I hate to tell you this, but I am currently stuck as a security camera. This is my life now. - Wait, what happens if I try to break the laptop maybe? I can't break the laptop either. What have you, oh, now I'm a security camera. What have we done? What have we done? - I love that Knarfy bought a server and I ruined it. Now he literally can't play on his own server. This is insane. - Like imagine the email. - There's two more that we didn't cover called elemental crops and trims for weapons. - Knarfy I'm gonna be honest, I don't think we're gonna cover them. - We're not gonna cover them, no. No we're not. Here's the real question though. Was it worth the $70 I paid for all this? - Nope. - Woo hoo. - You paid 70 bucks? - Yeah, this is 70 bucks in total. - Dang. Hey guys, make sure to join. - Please subscribe. - Happy birthday. - Oh, oh, oh, bye. Oh, see ya. You're my favorite viewer. Don't tell anyone tho :)
