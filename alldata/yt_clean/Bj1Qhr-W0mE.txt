This still looks like a beam. I think we still need more mats. The foam pit would be the Bad idea. Someone could land on you. This is so heavy. This is a fail. We need to look for a new location. We don't have much time. I'm gonna climb up this rock wall to see I see something. I have an idea. Hiding under the trampoline Bingo. This is the best spot. Nobody will ever find me here. I thought it was a door. It's just a wall. Gotta keep looking. Dang it. Maybe not the best idea. It looks like both teams are struggling Oh, this is a freezer. We can hide in here. And this could be our secret room. Good idea. Get in. It's a bit cold. Ooh, what about this? We can both fit in here. Come on, let's go. Oh, I don't able to fit in here. A mirror would be a perfect secret room. What about that door? Maybe not that. What about in here? The bathroom? It would be perfect. Nothing's covering it. You're right.

This side's exposed. Let's find something to look at with. We have to win that $1,000. We don't want that extreme punishment. Should we just, unfold it over the pit? Yeah, okay.

On the tic tac toe board, you. Get a circle placed right there. You did a really good job. Thanks. If we just go straight back, I agree. We should throw just for the middle. One, two, three. I like that. Boys are up. Front half. That was a very weak spin, but okay. Okay. You did not land in your square. Girls are up. Bad hand springs. You stuck it in your square. Another circle down for the girls. The girls have two circles down. What is your strategy? Strategy is definitely If I don't get it, Spin the wheel to find out your skill. Front hand spring. Are you confident with You know, I'm going be honest. Not really, but let's go for it. You fell out of your square. Now the girls have a chance of winning. Tic tac toe. Sawyer.

It looks like boys Are the winner. Let's take a look at these supplies. You've got some rope, duct tape, All of this will be a huge advantage Unfortunately, you won't have any of this. Do you think you still Well, competing for another advantage. I think so. What happened, bro? You're supposed to be It's a mess. I don't know, man. Things are falling apart over here. I just won my challenge, so now you need to go in yours. We clearly need all the help we can get. What am I gonna do? I got this. Maybe I can go up to that Wait, this is hollow... I have an idea. I lost. That's okay. Come look. Look at this awesome You should start to get This room is gonna need a lot of I need to find out a way to make This is the ju impossible shapes challenge, and whoever wins gets what And trust me, The boys won the last challenge, Whatever shape you land on, It looks like you got a square. That's an easy one. The girls didn't win the last challenge, Too easy. Yeah... Let's see you do it. Roll the dice. Slide. George Wall is doing an L. It looks like he made it through. So it was hollow right here. It's not even attached. Oh, my gosh. This is the perfect secret room. We are definitely gonna Girls, turn. Roll the dice. The heart. You think you can get through it? 100%. This heart might look easy, but if she touches this the whole thing will break instantly. Not bad, Ava. Oh, my goodness. Look at that advantage. That must be a huge mat. It would fit perfectly over here and make I really hope she wins it. Now it's time for the boys. Let's go. Circle. It's just a circle. But remember, so if you go too high, Ava, what shape are you the Roll the dice. The letter Z. The triangle. I'm so happy I didn't get the Z. The Z showed up a couple times. I thought you might have gotten it. A triangle is also extremely difficult. Because it comes to a point at the top, she's gonna wanna aim Looks like the girls made it Are you nervous right now? As long as I don't get this Z, I'm fine. Here we go. The one shape that you did not want. It's almost impossible, I'll do this. For the secret room. For the secret room. Oh, man.

You have to see this. It's the secret room. What is that? Wa. Come on. This could actually work. But there's still a lot of space. Maybe find some mats to stack around it. I have to go compete This is the one up challenge, and whoever wins this will win Yo, I want that fire. That fire is fire. The way this challenge will work and the other person has to complete it. Otherwise, you are out. Since the girls won the last challenge, you're up first. A front handspring. Now, you have to do a front handspring. That was easy. Come on. It was the first challenge. Now it's Sawyer's turn. Pick a skill. Enzo will have to do it, or he'll be up. Sawyer, why did you choose a front Flip. Because he fell in. Tic tac toc. Well, so I got it. You got it? Come on. That was easy. This is the perfect secret room. But it's missing something... I know. A gaming setup. I'm gonna call my roommate. He has the best gaming setup ever. This is gonna be epic.
