Done! And I'm finally ready to go out! Oh no! A sneeze! Ah-Choo! What... what the heck happened to me? Something is definitely not right! I need a mirror! Whoa! My face is covered in jewels! Amazing! I love it! Time to go wow the public! Come on, Tasha, time to come out. Your hair today is fantastic and on point. Hey! Look what she's got! No way! Your doll is beautiful! I love her hair! What's her name? Oh. Everyone is in love with her doll over there... Darla. I think we might need to do something with your hair. Wait! I know what we can do! All right. I can't change my doll but I can transform myself. I'll start with these green contacts. And now onto makeup. I'm going to use this white pencil on my eyelids. I'll just dab it on. And then I'll use a brush to blend it. Next up, this bright pink! I'll use it on the outsides of my lids. Now for the glitter! The best! Just a little bit on the white. I'll need a good cat eye with my eyeliner. Can't forget the bottom, either. Now for some more pink, too. And, of course, more glitter! There we go. Eyes are good, so time for the blender. All right, that's enough for the blender. I'll do a touch of blush with my brush, and then move onto brows. They've been shaped so now I need to add some more color. Time for lips! Last step, false lashes! Did you think I was done? Nope! Got you! Two little white lines on my lips will look like highlights. And now, of course, I need hair. Hair is set. Now for some more makeup. I'll paint my hair line with this brown. And now for some more white lines. Yes! I'm done! And I look spectacular if I say so myself! She's just so lovely and--oh my gosh! That's right. I'm back in class. Oh, wow wow wow! Look at her! You look just like her doll but better! Sorry Tasha! I'll see you later! Watch me do my doll dance! All right! I think my ice cream table is finally ready to go! Ugh. Look at her over there. Huh? Is she glaring at me? Hey! Ice cream! Come and get it over here! Yes! Here's your ice cream cone! Thank you so much and enjoy! Ice cream! Fresh and delicious! Today only! Yes! My ice cream is a huge hit! One for you, and here for you and you, too! What? I can't believe she made so much money already! Hey! I have ice cream over here! It's delicious! Why doesn't anyone want to buy my ice cream? It's just as delicious. Wait! Maybe it's my look! Okay. I'll start with eye color. I think I'll go with blue. And now I'll use one of my ice cream cones. I traced the cone, and now I need paper napkins and liquid latex. I'll crumple the paper and dip it into the latex. Now I'll put it around the circle I drew. I want to make sure to do it around the whole circle. There we go. Done. Now to bring the cone back. And I'll just place the cone back into the spot I traced. Okay. I'll use this white pencil to trace a line down my face. All the way down to my lips and chin. Okay. That should be good enough. Now for this pink paint pallet and brush. I'll dab it on the paper, now that it's dried. I'll cover all the paper and then start painting my face, too. Done. You know what's next? Sprinkles! I'll just sprinkle them over the cone and the paint. I'll also put them on my lips and my eyelid! And I'm done! It looks like I have a melted cone on my face! Time to get back to selling ice cream! Ice cream! I have ice cream available! Whoa! Look at her! That's where I'm gonna get my ice cream! Wow! Your makeup is amazing! Thanks! Here's your ice cream! Me too, please! I'd like a cone! Ooh! This ice cream is delicious! Argh! What the heck? Well, I can do that, too! There! See? What do you think about that?! Gosh. I really wish I could meet an alien. I just gotta keep looking out there and see what I can find. Look at these amazing shoes I got! Sorry, I'm doing some science right now. Wait, I know what I can do to get your attention! All right. Time to start my makeup transformation. I'll start by drawing a line around my eye. And then I'll do the same with the other eye, too. Okay that's good. Now for some black. I'll fill in the shapes that I drew with more black. Can't forget to cover my eyebrows, too. I don't need to do anything with my lids yet, though. Because for those spaces I'll use a pencil instead of a brush. Next up, the green of course! I'll just paint every other part of my skin with this color. Gotta do my lips, too. And of course my hair. Can't forget to make that green. I'll need a smaller brush to go along the black lines. And now I need this darker green for some contour lines. I'll have to blend it, too. Under my lip, as well, for contour. I'll add some more on my lips right here. All right, time to add some yellow for contrast. I'll just dab it onto my cheek bones. Pretty much right around the black eyes I drew. And then I'll touch up my black lines and add a bit of white. Now if I close my eyes, I look like an alien! This is gonna be great! Hmm? What's that sound? Hmm. That's just one of my wall decals. No way no way no way... Ahhhh! Finally! I love you! You're amazing! All right, we've got to take a selfie! Wait. Are you kidding me? This is just makeup? Ugh! I can't believe you're not a real alien! Well, I guess it's time to take off the makeup. Just wipe off all the green and black. It shouldn't take too long to get it all off. I know! I couldn't believe she said that to him! Yoink! I got it! Ha-ha! Keep away! Oops. Ooooh. We're gonna be in trouble. That is it! You know there's no running in the halls! I expect to see your parents in my office! Oof. That's rough. I'm sorry I got you in trouble. Wait a second! I've got an idea! Time for another makeup transformation! I'll start by adding makeup in this area. It's a watered down glue that'll have to dry. I'll put some in this area, too. While stretching my skin a bit. Then when it dries, my face looks wrinkled! Can't forget down here by my nose and mouth. Got to do the other side, too. I'll blow out cheek. And that one's done, too! Now to focus on my eyelids. Hah! Look at how much older I look! But my lips still look youthful. Gotta get them, too. But now for my eyebrows. I'll shape them with some more glue to turn them gray. Gotta do my eyelashes, too. Now to do some blending. Last step--an old lady wig! What do you think? Do I look like a mom? Or more like a grandma? Hello. Principal? Here's my grandma like you asked. I see. Please take a seat. Have a seat right here, grandma. I'll just be outside. Hm. You're her grandmother? You sent this home for me? Ah. Okay. Well, you see, she was running in the hallway. I understand. Say no more. I'll speak with her about following the rules. HAH! It totally worked! She bought it! Yes! Thank you! You're the bestest friend ever! Time to peel off my wrinkly face! Look at that! It's coming right off! Wait a second... Hey! What do you think you're doing?! Run away! Hey bro. That was such a great game. Right? I love playing one on one. Back at ya! Let's play again! Oh basketball! Fun! Can I play, too? Uhhhh, no way. This is guys day. Well, what the heck? I thought you liked playing basketball? Guys are so dumb sometime. Hmmm. Wait a second. What if I... Better take off these earrings to start. All right. Now time to remove all my makeup. Can't forget my lashes and eyes. Bye bye, glitter. I like how clean my face feels after taking it all off. I'm a clean canvas and ready for a new look. I'll start by darkening my eyebrows. And then shaping them so they look thicker and wild. Now time to add some contour lines. But I'm doing them this way. Now to start blending it all in. Okay. It's eyelash tackling time! Just add a bit of foundation to them. And now I'll need just a little bit of this black color. Just a little dab so I can do small dots right here. I want to make it look like I've got some stubble. Just all across my jawline and chin. There. I'm done. Just need one more thing. The hat will hide my long hair. What do you think? Think they'll buy it? Do I look like one of the guys? I think this is one of my better transformations. They'll have to let me play now. Man. This ball is totally flat. Hey. Bro. Wanna play? Nice job, bro! What do you think about this? I'm not a bro at all. You should have let me play earlier. Yeah. Okay you're right. Let's play.
