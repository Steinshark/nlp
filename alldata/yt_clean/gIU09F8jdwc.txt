Yeah. I'm going to-- Here, I'll show you-- you know, obviously, you know, you can see a little So the denutter was a that the inventor's son Looks like a salad spinner. Well, you know, before there was the denutter. And a salad spinner was actually So what you can do with and for our customers, I'll put in two big covered peanuts here. And just like the [WHIRRING] Spin it. And then you know It pops up. Did you see that? See them all in there? Yeah. OK. So now those guys-- those guys are hollow, and What? You're kidding me. Yeah.

MICHAEL CARBONARO: I'm questioning everything. I just don't even understand. What are you going because they're empty? Well, we have people Is there a renutter? Can you put them back? That's a good idea. That is a really good idea. Maybe if they had it it would put the nuts on So that would be-- But that's weird. Because the nuts actually went-- on the other side Yeah. You know, the chocolate has to dust, nut oils, and everything. How do those even That's what I Ugh. My mind is so confused. Yeah. But I'll get my let me see if there's a-- Who are you?
