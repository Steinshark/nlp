You all know Larry Wheels by now. Pound for He definitely has a strong grip, but how strong? We so I thought it'd be interesting to see who has We will be competing in 4 different exercises: good to have big hands and a strong wrist. The and a strong and flexible thumb. Vertical Grip, to a closed grip position and this Vertical Grip least, the Pinch Block. For this one it's good You have a strong grip right? I believe so, and I have some experience with all these tools here. And you have big hands right? Let me see your hands. Compared to you I'd say so. Definitely yeah. So and hopefully some of them are going to favor me. dozen times or so, never consistently With that the water. You think okay. For sure. Maybe you don't Yeah for sure, I think you're gonna kill me in the a more comfortable grip, I will smash you, but want to start with? Let's do the Rolling Thunder. We'll get the most weight with that one. And shout out to Grip Genie, Jujimufu's company. We got a 25 pound loaded. Not even use a chalk? Not yet, it's only 25 pounds. for everything I do. All right. I use chalk for I'm gonna cap like you. Okay, yeah that's very easy, we can go up quite a bit. Yeah. But are you gonna use your thumb are you gonna keep.. I'm Gonna You feel better with the thumb over? Let's see. It feels pretty similar. Right. Yeah, I can't tell, more weight on we're gonna be able to tell. 30 How does that feel? It's still light. Still now it's actually starting to feel like you you could curl it you know. You can do anything still really easy. Yeah. Feeling it yet? I'm feeling it a little bit, it's not that effortless anymore, but I I wonder what the world record for the Rolling Okay. You know what it is? About 125 he did... 125 kg. That's extremely ridiculous. Well, who knows, Good. Easy. Oh yeah, still so easy. Yeah but now I'm starting to feel. Yeah a little bit. I feel it a little bit now. Do you know what your record is? I was in Dubai, so with kg's I can't remember. I'm pretty sure it was like 95 kg, like 180 I'm pretty sure. And because we're going up really slowly, I can't I tell how much Nice. You don't feel any bit fatigued from I'm a lot stronger in my right though, left is Well, how much should we move up then? Is 10 enough? Yeah I'd say 10. The thing is, now we're doing a lot of lifts. Yeah. It would have been smarter for us to start really high. I agree. Because now Should we maybe put another 10 too? Yeah. So we You're left is weaker too? Yeah climbing, I'm shocked you feel nothing. That was my plan, to tire him out uh climbing. It works. Definitely worked. [ __ ] nice! Oh yeah, pretty convincing left as well. only have 20 pounds left, but I think 10 But man we've done a lot of lifts now, we should Nice. Come on. Do you want to try with the thumb? I could try with the thumb, see how that goes. No, it doesn't make it any easier. Yeah. Nice! Well now it's heavy. Yeah. Still getting it with the left. Yeah I guess I'm more equal than I thought. Yeah it looks like that's solid. I don't that's going to be pretty close to my limit. Yeah you're not gonna try left. Still going up easily. Yeah. Really good, oh yeah. We don't have space for much more weight now. Should we just try to put another 10 on? Yep, nice. That's though. That's all you need, Not if you're rock climbing V2. Yep, I mean you I think this is... It's definitely there dude. Oh [ __ ]. I may have just edged you out. Yeah I think so. If we went up a five, I think it would have gotten it. I don't have it, good job. Oh yes sir. You had me shaking for a second, like holy he's gonna beat me. This is one other few where it's good to have though. Yes. That's not comfortable at all. I Easy. There it is. It's all just about getting the right grip you know. Yeah, for this especially, yes. Oh yeah. It's gonna make a huge difference right here. I think it's important to use chalk for this one Yeah good. That was a massive jump. Oh yeah, this Yeah. To grip work 100%. But I don't big jump up. Well let's see. Are you gripping it like this? Yeah, but I tuck the thumb like this. You tuck the thumb. So yeah like that. Yeah. It's even more awkward because the Wow that's a crazy way of lifting it. Nice. I don't think I'm gonna do another 10, but. You don't think so? Come on. That was effortless. But I remember with the Hub especially, it just becomes impossible all of a sudden. It's like it goes from easy to impossible within a couple of pounds. It's not happen. Slipping right off. Oh yeah that's really good, you still have five pounds. Maybe. Really impressive. I think I'm gonna stay there though. Yeah okay. I tuck the thumb like that. This way? I can't even bend my thumb in that direction. So it's Oh shii, so it's actually a lot. I think this might This is definitely more than I've ever done. You're doing it like here? Yeah like that. Hell no, no way. All right. Yeah I'm not surprised. Then it's 1-1. Yeah we're even. So it's still exciting. Oh yeah and you nearly got me on the Rolling Thunder. Nearly got me there too. Well yeah I don't know, I think you had more in you. I don't think so. The next Vertical Grip? Let's call it that for now. It looks like a comfortable grip. I'm not sure how you're supposed to lift it though. I think it's like this. Should we start with that weight? Because I think this is a lot easier than Oh yeah this is gonna be easy. Yeah it's gonna be too easy. Yeah. It's just too comfortable. Yeah it's very about your legs I think. Yeah. I don't know if my grip is going to be my weakest... we'll see. You just want to throw a bunch of weight on? Yeah. Two 25's I'd say. Yeah. It should be uh 112 lb It was just quick math. You seem like you're quick. You look smart, what is that haha. Yeah. My left probably.. Yeah. It feels too comfortable I don't know. Yeah I don't know what's going to fail first. I think we're going to lift the the most on this one. Oh easily yeah. I'm not sure we have enough weight for this. Maybe not. Come on Larry, nice. I feel the challenge Yeah now it's starting to slip a little bit. Yeah. It still looks comfortable for you. Yeah. Let's put that 45 on maybe. We could take off a 15 and put a 45 on? Yeah. Oh now it's getting hard. Yeah. Yeah definitely challenging now. Do you ever Only Atlas Stones, you'll use tacky, but for this stuff chalk is the best. And you rub it in Yeah and it takes like an hour to put it on, and an hour to take it off, it's the worst. Yeah. No, I don't think I have it. There it is. Well, let's put on another 15 and I think that's going to be the end of me. Oh yeah strong, damn dude. Way over your body weight. Yeah it is. Yep yep it moved though. It moved, but you have that one. I'll take it. All right so it's 2-1 to Larry, but we still have one left. Yeah the pinch grip. We're definitely gonna need way less weight. I mean it does favor bigger hands. So this is a brand new Pinch Block. I see. Yeah it already feels like a little [ __ ]. Yeah haha Yeah. I can't do it with my left. What no way? Your left weird. I think this because of the size of the Yeah I can't get them all the way down there, so I think for me it's better too almost have it like a narrow pinch, but this favours a bigger hand. You can go up a lot 15. Yeah 15. Not a lot, like the Hub where you go up like five pounds and it makes a big difference. What is the record on this, do you know? I don't know, we could probably Google that. So easy. Save your other hand though. Try to go up okay. 87 lb.. uh I think. I'll look at my old footage and see what my personal record is. I need more chalk maybe. Come on. No way. You just know in a second. That was strong though. You crushed me. That was uh 3-1. You have strong Yeah I just did and I love it actually. You're 155 lb dude. I have 100 pounds on you. Yeah you do. I have a hundred pounds on him and he's doing nearly Well make sure you check out Larry on all Magnus, link down below. Make sure to
