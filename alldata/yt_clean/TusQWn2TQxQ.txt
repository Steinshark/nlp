[ dramatic music ] [Narrator] Before the 1950s car manufacturers had a problem: safety. Sharp flanges. Metal that didn't crumple. Untempered glass. And you can forget about Cars were dangerous. [car horn] The problem was that was the study of the aftermath. Trying to piece together from a few vague clues. That's a pretty tough If the auto industry they needed a hero. Someone that would allow from the inside. They needed... Sierra Sam, the world's first Over the course of Sam's life, Sam endured all manner of uh... testing. But these weren't Each one was carefully For the first time Sam what happens in a car crash and then make adjustments without the need for So you can thank Sam seat belts and all the things The safety features that by studying crashes Today car companies to create cars safe enough But what about the How do we ensure it's and have safety features built in to protect the The same way the auto industry By breaking things and then studying exactly [sound of door closing] [ anthemic music ] When it's your job to keep you have to live and just like the attackers do. Because the only way is to think like one. [ soft music ] This is Daniel Fabian. [Daniel] Hey. [Narrator] Despite his he carries one of the in all of Google. [Daniel] The job title is Staff Digital Arsonist. [ sinister music ] Yeah, I run the So setting things on mostly means to run what where we basically take and try to hack into Google. [Narrator] You heard Google's Red Team is a who spend their days just trying [Daniel] I think to just say we're hackers. [ soft music ] I was always kind of interested in like the mechanics [watch ticking] got super upset because I disassembled No particular reason outside Tiny gear wheels and It just fascinated me. I wasn't able to just to get ahead But I think a hacker is someone who tries to break things in order to understand them. [Narrator] It may but this hacker mentality is shared by many of [Niru] I mean, since I like and finding issues, the best place to do it [laughs] [Narrator] This is a security engineer But in some circles she's [Niru] My handle is c0rg1. [dog barking] [Niru laughs] [Narrator] Beyond she's even got the [Niru] I should have never It supposed to be an Easter egg. [dog howling] Yes, I would say I'm a hacker. I might qualify it by where you're not hacking you're hacking to [ soft music ] [Director] What's your with the Red Team? [Heather] The Red Team They bring a completely new because they're not with having to maintain it. With having to deal and functionality issues, and that's so valuable that we didn't actually build it always the way [Niru] How does it hold up That's kind of our job to come give that answer. [Heather] So they're agents of testing, if you will. [Operator] Fire! [ rousing music ] [Narrator] Just as have different models Google has different Each with unique features And it's the Red Team's job to put all of them We'll let Daniel and [Daniel] Yeah, We have targeted Ads, we've targeted Search. We've targeted-- [Niru] Gmail. [Daniel] Google Cloud. [Niru] Chrome. [Daniel] YouTube. [Niru] Maps. [Daniel] What else Um... [Narrator] You get it. [Daniel] Yeah, whatever. [Narrator] Every single each with its own security team dedicated to keeping it safe. And the Red Team--they've In fact, the mere mention is enough to put security [Tim] Ooh. Yes, I have heard of the [Tim] One of the most [Eduardo] Most [Niru] Anyone would [Fatima] I heard but it might have been [Narrator] Alright, so which is probably most apparent [Daniel] Back when like, the latest, newest, were Google Glass. [Sergey Brin] This can go wrong so tell me now, who wants [audience cheers] [Narrator] That's right, [Creator] A phone [Robert Scoble] It's part I'm never gonna take it off. [Narrator] Google's into wearable technology. [Daniel] We wanted to target people who work on Google Glass so we could get access blueprints, the electronics behind it. Everything that a real adversary would be very interested in. [Niru] Some of Red Teaming is people in the real world and actually emulate That doesn't mean that we will do everything [Narrator] Right. Red Team has something that most attackers don't... rules. [Daniel] Yeah, we have that we call First of all, Another obvious one is, we can never ever access [Narrator] The rules to make sure no one [Niru] Yes. [laughs] No bribing. No coercion. [Narrator] They literally to chloroform security guards. [Niru] Yes, obviously [Daniel] So in our &quot;Okay, what could we do to get Googlers to actually give us And one idea that we had is we could send them under some pretense like, &quot;Congratulations on your anniversary for Here is a small gift.&quot; [Narrator] So what was this that the team gifted to [Daniel] Yeah, I have it I searched my attic It looks just like a very, If there is a thing as a [ ominous music ] [Narrator] Yes, a of the science adorned with the Google decal, and loaded with Now remember this was 2012. A time when USB was perhaps the most ubiquitous Beyond thumb drives or webcams, people were plugging in fans, lights, fans with lights, charging devices and pointless things But once is all it takes. No matter how plugging in a USB could exploit allowing an attacker [Daniel] When you plugged if you were super careful, you would see for about a a black window And that's when the plasma globe would send a series of that would download our backdoor and install it on a computer, and that is that. To be fair, not everyone so there were definitely However, we did get two or and who got infected. [Narrator] You might imagine successfully compromising these computers would mean the end of [Daniel] Okay, I The people that we compromised were actually completely [Niru] Oftentimes when through the door, you might not be near what So think of it like [ video game music ] you cleared the first area and now you're in a new area and the map is [Daniel] So usually in order it is multiple different that we call a kill chain. [Narrator] Yep, a kill chain: a string of different attacks that bring hackers progressively Despite the plasma it was only the first used to steal the plans [Daniel] After we used we were able to of the person we and then we could to access anything that [Narrator] Including The Red Team drafted fake emails using the stolen identities and sent them to who were busy working [Daniel] At the very bottom there was a tiny image and that image was loaded [Narrator] That website the target's without them knowing, but for it to work the target would first [Daniel] We were thinking, &quot;Okay, what kind of email that people would but on the other hand that they would discuss And the topic that we was workplace ergonomics. [ rousing music ] [Infomercial voice] Even small to big damage when they [Daniel] So like, how do and make sure that you and that your desk and that you don't That sort of thing. [Infomercial voice] When the damage is multiplied. [Daniel] Long story short worked well. [laughs] [Narrator] Emails were opened, targets were compromised, digital fingerprints It was time for the Red Team [Daniel] So we presented back to Google and &quot;Hey, that's the user and who has access to all the and everything related and it allowed us [Narrator] By any measure, this marked the successful But then... [Daniel] But then we Yes, we decided, okay, now but it will be really cool if we got a physical pair of Google Glass glasses. [Narrator] The team and wrote a new email directly to one of the &quot;Hey, we need to pick up for like some VIP at Google so we're gonna come to I hate lying to people and I always get super when I have to do that. So it turns out that we one or two grammar [Narrator] The mistakes that when they arrived there was no pair of and they were instead met by Google's Head of [Security guard] Come [Daniel] So yes, we did That was kinda like where we then [Robot voice] Game over. [ soft music ] [Narrator] Even when the Red the job is only half done. The other half? Patching the holes to make their way so no real attacker can In the case of the the hole was a USB port hole in a computer of the hundreds of thousands each one of them a potential [Darren] Maybe a real attacker might not do the but they have a lot whether that's, USB keys dropped modifying the mice that people plug into their And so understanding how do we ensure that we're dealing with, how do we make that any USB device that you plug in isn't just open for an [Daniel] So we had how are we gonna protect And what we did was we that would defend USB ports [Narrator] Through USB, the plasma globe by delivering hundreds in a fraction of a second. Remember this? [beep] Yeah, that fast. Much faster than any human [Daniel] This software If the keystrokes then it blocks them. [Narrator] And just like that, USB ports across Google But what about the of other USB ports and computers all [Daniel] Well the nice thing we actually open-sourced So anyone can install it and make sure that against this type of attack. [Narrator] Of course, this is just one of Red Team exercises have created. They've helped make the With that level of success, you'd think their work would make headlines But the truth is it doesn't and probably never will. Red Team exercises Thousands of vulnerabilities and fixed in silence. The only real mementos are for the billions of [ pensive orchestration ] [Daniel] If we are able that make the next exercise I say we've done an amazing job and we've actually achieved And we do really see that because probably 90% just doesn't work. [Niru] We try it, and we'll try again. [Director] Does that [laughs] [Niru] It's a good thing when That means that things [ soft music fades out ] [ anthemic music ] [Eduardo] we ask people to tell us about [Bug hunter 1] Nice catch. [Bug hunter 2] Nice catch. [Bug hunter 3] Nice catch. [Eduardo] That's why it's It's like hunting, for bugs. [Tim] These days, you on the gray market. Almost certainly to We will keep paying you, if you keep reporting bugs. [Bug hunter 3] They were gonna [Hacker 2] Whoa! Very nice catch! Oh my god! [Katie] The best are securing the internet and everything that runs on it.
