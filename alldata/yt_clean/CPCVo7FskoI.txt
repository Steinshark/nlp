AND I GET TO -- AND I'M VERY AWARE OF THE AND I GET UP THERE AND THIS BEAUTIFUL APPEARS IN THE SKY, LIKE A GIGANTIC 60 FEET IN DIAMETER. THE CENTER FILLS AND THEN THE AND THEN AS THOUGH I HAD ON THE JETS ON THE AIRCRAFT I WENT AT INTO THAT TUNNEL OF LIGHT. I HAD HEARD THE TUNNEL OF LIGHT, AND I THINK MOST BUT THAT'S EXACTLY IT'S A CORRIDOR AND SOMETIMES -- AND IT WAS ALMOST I WENT THROUGH IT. THE STRANGEST TYPICALLY IF YOU HEAR THE SPEED YOU FEEL THE WIND NOTHING, JUST SILENCE. I COME TO A DOOR, AND IT'S COVERED IN MIST, A DOOR OR A PORTAL. AND I LIFT -- I KNOW I BUT TO GO THROUGH, BECAUSE THE TUNNEL AND SO I STEP THROUGH. AND IT'S MISTY, BUT I LOOK DOWN THE MIST STARTS TO CLEAR, AND I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I'M STANDING ON THE BEAUTIFUL GREEN GRASS EACH BLADE LIT UP. AND I NOW KNOW WHAT THEY THE GRASS IS ALWAYS THEY'RE TALKING JONI: YEAH.
