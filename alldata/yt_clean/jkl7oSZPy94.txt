Hey, it's me SomethingElseYT! Don't be fake. I guess let's just get right into the game. We have to-- -...probably explain the rules that would be smart. James you thought of this idea. So... Well, way to throw me under the bus! You'll probably get it as we go along, but basically we all chose words. Just a three-letter word and then we made an acronym for that word so an example would be B.U.S. would be big ugly snail and then we would draw a big ugly snail and then the other people would have to try and guess B.U.S. and we'll give them clues we'll push 'em in the right direction Well, it's it's gonna be a kind of a guessing game. ye. ye. OH YE! ye *meme trumpets and kazoos playing in perfect harmony and sync to create such a beautiful piece nobody would not like it* Me and Jaiden are basically competing right now. Prepare to lose, Adam. (Jaiden) So this is a three letter word, people watch my videos for my artistic ability. That's for sure. ((yes we do!!)) I'm like trying to concentrate cause I wanna, I wanna beat Jaiden. Let's hope this is good. So you guys can get this mmm? I'm such an artist. He's narwhal Falling... under... F.A.M.! Is it F.A.M.?

Wait? Is there two sways of spelling laser? You're asking the wrong person on how to spell Oh yeah, You're right Cut to like all your misspellings in your videos I've done this new tactic where I purposely misspell things like REALLY wrong So when I actually do misspell something people will be like, &quot;Oh! That's just his thing he misspells things&quot; So y-you cheat? So like when you actually do a REAL typo it's like &quot;Oh I totally meant to do that.&quot; Yeah, exactly. My teachers part two video there was a chalkboard that said how to escape a restaurant And I used the wrong two on purpose, but restaurant was misspelled, so like I totally meant to misspell restaurant.
