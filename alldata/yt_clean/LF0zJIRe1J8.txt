[theme] [waitress] And I'll be right [Christine]<i> Here's a tip.</i> Fifteen, 18, 20. [Christine]<i> We've had enough.</i> I don't know I buy a coffee Yeah, it has gone overboard. It's really intimidating [Christine]<i> So have we hit It's not about it's not about the food. It's just an added expense [Christine]<i> <i> Who's really getting There is no guarantee the tips are actually going to workers, [Christine]<i> [energetic music playing] <i> Ever hear of Secret Santa?</i> <i> We're setting up a store <i> It's loaded <i> and buried mics.</i> <i> All part of a</i> Marketplace<i> <i> How much more <i> for very little service?</i> Would you like to add -20 is fine. Uh... -I'll give you $1 tip. [Christine]<i> Tipping. <i> It's becoming the norm, <i> But we want to know,</i> <i> are businesses <i> And where are those tips <i> To find out, <i> and pounding the pavement The secret's all in the lid. <i> And documenting <i> and how much.</i> <i> We all expect to tip <i> That's because <i> below minimum wage <i> with the assumption that tips <i> That changed in 2022.</i> <i> So why have tip percentages <i> At every sit-down place <i> tip prompts start <i> And go up to 20 <i> Even servers themselves <i> Could those higher percentages</i> <i> be pushing us to tip more?</i> <i>The payment platform Square says</i> <i> five years ago,</i> <i> we shell out <i> Last year, that jumps Are you a big tipper? I am a moderate tipper. [Christine]<i> <i> the economy <i> He's a professor Tipping is a social norm. It is something it is an expectation. But it does feel Yeah, I think in tipping culture But in the last probably since the pandemic, we've really seen When restaurants we were worried so many of us because we're trying to keep And I think &quot;Oh, people are tipping more, We'll keep this going. [Christine]<i> It's not just <i> Check out <i> popping up <i> including coffee shops...</i> <i> and mall food courts...</i> <i> big chains...</i> <i> and independent shops.</i> <i> At almost two-thirds</i> <i> of the fast food places <i> the terminal asks us <i> Most recommend <i> At a few, up to 30 percent.</i> What do you make of fast food Where did this come from? There's more price pressure and there's more wage pressure So, ask people for tips gives our staff without us actually [Christine]<i> <i> we also noticed <i> One coffee shop <i> another doesn't.</i> <i> One sandwich shop <i> The next, nothing.</i> It's making us, I would say, because it's gone This inconsistency to the discomfort [Christine]<i> And get this,</i> <i> we find many payment systems</i> <i> calculate that suggested tip</i> <i> on top of tax.</i> I have thought about it you know, sometime I want to do But you're sitting there and you're not but it seems like But I can see how it adds up Well, it does add up But very quickly, or more that's coming in a time that we're feeling And so, I think [Christine]<i> <i> are giving customers a break.</i> <i> Ryan Hamilton owns [Ryan] It comes up automatically And that feels like That is [Christine]<i> He skips the tip <i> and lets people offer one Why do you skip the tip? Because I don't want to feel obligated when they come It's not about it's not about It's just an added expense to the customer, So, it's not gratuity anymore. Do you think people -than in the past? People are struggling, what a person's budget is. Sure, businesses but that's not They shouldn't be looking But if they do so, you should be grateful you shouldn't put on what they It should come and that's when I think [Christine]<i> But it's not just <i> pushing tip culture.</i> <i> There's some psychology <i> driven by technology.</i> There's no doubt that we're not only for more tips, we're being asked And so, you know, a little jar Now, at the point of sale... it's in your face. You have to explicitly And if you look this sort of framing the midpoint people feel bad I would argue we have a guilt gene -We want to be nice. And so, But because that we tip, [festive music playing] [Christine]<i> So, will you <i> without getting Today's actually <i> Back at our holiday shop,</i> <i> that's what we're putting It's a good little Which one would you like? -These are $3? And we also have these, -[indistinct] <i> Some shoppers Would you like to add a tip No? A lot of businesses so, they told me -Would you like to add a tip? [Christine]<i> But the majority <i> just for putting an item You can put -What do you say? That is very generous of you. Since you're a nice woman, [chuckles] I don't know I buy a coffee and they're asking for a tip, [Christine]<i> <i> that our shop I just want to share I'm actually So there are Bill, Dave. I knew it-- I knew it First off, that I asked for a tip? I mean, Uh, it was a little odd. And did you feel pressure? Especially if you're paying, and then the person is looking at you It's really intimidating It's like it's expected. Does it feel like It used to be something and now it's not. It's just, like, something It's not a choice anymore. And I don't want I'd rather pay what I feel is fair for a service. I actually thought I didn't think on basically no service. But, it almost seemed like, Would you like to pay You're essentially And in many cases, So, if we can keep prices low and then charge you at the end of that experience, who wouldn't think It is unbelievable that to this degree of rejecting someone [Christine]<i> Tipping on winter <i> but we are inspired <i> Like this auto shop.</i> <i> We visit <i> to get new [Christine]<i> <i> They tell us their customers [Christine]<i> We even see it -[woman] Hey. Well, I think they're trying in that circumstance You can see &quot;Oh, all these other places Why shouldn't we ask Think of the social pressure They're ecstatic, they've just and you ask for a tip, Probably not, that social pressure. Should they be tipped? Maybe they should [Christine]<i> What about <i> with anyone?</i> <i> In our spot check <i> we come across <i> asking for tips.</i> All right, 15 percent, 20 percent, and the tip <i> And even online.</i> <i> Some places aren't waiting</i> <i> until you check out <i> Look what this bakery asks for &quot;Please use this menu item And there's a $5 option, <i> It extends beyond food Okay, what city Let's say Calgary. <i> Another example <i> where you might That's wild. I've never seen this I mean, but to say so give us it just seems <i> And check this out.</i> Let's go with medium. Support the designer's talent. I mean, out at fast food but 5%, 10%, 15%. But see, You said, So automatically, you were less inclined So, that could be But this goes that this is a service. To me, it is outrageous that we're being asked I think creep is going to continue, both in terms and the places If we reward the behaviour, it's going to come up To me, it's accelerating. If people how do they push back the person The reality is that are changing the rules, and we don't have to We reach out since they represent including some We tell them of the fast food prompt us for a tip. But they say of wide-scale tip prompting We also reach out They say a transparent and they recommend restaurants &quot;offer a range so customers And they should tip <i> We're on a mission <i> to see how tipping <i> And how customers are feeling <i> into tipping more.</i> They are leveraging <i> When we ask shoppers Do you feel like you know -Like who they go to? [Christine]<i> ...many assume I guess I think the workers working not the owners. So the tips not the owners. -And that should be a rule? [Christine]<i> Speaking of rules, <i> employers can't keep <i> In Ontario and B.C.,</i> <i> employers are only entitled <i> if they directly <i> Otherwise, <i> Some call it tip theft.</i> <i> So, we're back undercover <i> to see if those rules <i> And who keeps <i> you're being prompted <i> At this place, <i> they don't see [Christine]<i> We hear <i> at big chains, too.</i> In some cases, In some cases, they asked me, <i> Mike Von Massow <i> who studies tipping.</i> <i> What does he think Some of those places But it is, particularly that are non-traditional where staff that they should be [Christine]<i> Mike says</i> <i> there needs to be <i> about where tips really go.</i> The perception is that that person is the one getting the tip, or at least And if they're not, it's going to increase I think At least two employees tell us they don't get We're not naming in an effort not to identify In response, employees should be and they're investigating Two say their employees although one admits to using tips although they say Two don't respond. Ontario's Ministry of Labour has received allegations nearly 800 but they won't say have been investigated. So we're asking, what's being done They say enforcement along with fines <i> So rules are being broken <i> But some places <i> None of these provinces <i> have protections <i> In Alberta...</i> <i> It would be somewhat shocking <i> or maybe [Christine]<i> Carolyn Cron</i> <i> from the Workers' Resource <i> there are no consequences <i> There are certain demographics <i> I can tell you <i> are often more subject <i> I can also say <i> is largely a woman-centred <i> I would like to see <i> take a hard line <i> So, rather than relying <i> and the potential [Christine]<i> We hear the same <i> at the Halifax <i> In Nova Scotia, <i> that tips are actually because there are no legal <i> It's a free-for-all.</i> <i> We put out a survey <i> and about 73% wrote back</i> <i> and said that they had <i> Unfortunately, as long <i> there's nothing [Christine]<i> We asked <i> for governing wages <i> what they're doing <i> Both say <i> so aren't governed.</i> <i> But they're keeping an eye <i> Alberta adds while tips <i> theft is,</i> <i> and workers can report it <i> Meantime, <i> for those of us <i> We really encourage customers <i> about the breakdown <i> start conversations <i> and places <i> about where that money <i> and just making themselves</i> <i> a bit more engaged [Christine]<i> And as you're doing <i> remember, It should be you can leave Do you know what I mean? They have good service, If they don't, If you don't want to tip,
