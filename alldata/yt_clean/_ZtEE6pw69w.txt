&gt;&gt;ANNOUNCER: LET ME ASK YOU: WHAT IF IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ALL OVER THE EARTH DISAPPEARED AND WERE GONE? WHAT IF A LARGE COALITION OF NATIONS GATHERED FROM THE NORTH OF EUROPE AND PART OF AFRICA, AND TRIED TO INVADE ISRAEL? DID YOU KNOW THAT ALL OF THESE EVENTS ARE PREDICTED TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE, ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE? TODAY, THREE BIBLICAL SCHOLARS WHO KNOW GREEK AND HEBREW, AND HAVE WRITTEN 157 BOOKS BETWEEN THEM ARE OUR GUESTS. THEY ARE, DR. MARK HITCHCOCK, DR. RON RHODES, AND JEFF KINLEY. IT IS INTERESTING THAT IN THE POLLS OF THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER, THEY SHOW THAT 4 IN 10 AMERICANS BELIEVE WE ARE LIVING IN THE LAST DAYS. FURTHER, THEY FOUND OUT THAT 70 PERCENT OF EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS BELIEVE CHRIST COULD RETURN DURING THEIR LIFETIME. WHERE DOES THE BIBLE TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS? TODAY, YOU WILL FIND OUT ON THIS SPECIAL EDITION OF THE JOHN ANKERBERG SHOW. &gt;&gt;DR. JOHN ANKERBERG: WELCOME TO OUR PROGRAM. I'M JOHN ANKERBERG, AND I HAVE THREE OF THE BEST BIBLICAL SCHOLARS WITH ME TODAY. WE'VE GOT DR. MARK HITCHCOCK, WE'VE GOT JEFF KINLEY, AND DR. RON RHODES. AND THE FACT IS, GUYS, THAT THE BIBLE TALKS ABOUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A WAR COMING IN THE MIDDLE EAST. AND I'D LIKE TO ASK MY AUDIENCE RIGHT NOW, AS YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE NEWS IS SAYING ABOUT, OH, IRAN, SYRIA, ISRAEL, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE AROUND THAT AREA, SUDAN, WE'VE GOT PROBLEMS, RIGHT? DID YOU KNOW THAT THE BIBLE TALKS ABOUT THAT AREA? AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT, THERE'S TWO GREAT BATTLES THAT THE BIBLE SAYS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ONE OF THEM, IT'S CALLED THE EZEKIEL 38 WAR. COMES FROM THE PROPHET EZEKIEL, WHO OVER MANY YEARS AGO, 2800 YEARS AGO POSSIBLY, GOD GAVE HIM SOME INFORMATION IN OUR TIME. AND I WANT YOU AND SEE IF YOU AGREE THAT [FINGER SNAP] ANY TIME WHILE WE'RE LIVING RIGHT NOW, THE OFFSHOOT OF ALL AND I'D LIKE TO ALSO START THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER. DID YOU KNOW THAT 4 IN 10 THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER, SAY IS LIVING IN THE END TIMES? IF YOU ASK EVANGELICAL LIVING IN THE END TIMES. NOW, DO YOU THINK WE'RE LIVING WHAT YOU SEE IN OUR COUNTRY AND WELL, LET'S GO TO AND I'M GOING TO ASK YOU, RON, INTERPRETATION, BUT I'M GOING BUT ALL YOU GUYS THAT WENT TO THEY ACTUALLY MAKE YOU AND YOU ACTUALLY SO, WHAT I'M READING IN LOOKED AT EVERY WORD SO, I'M GOING TO ASK YOU FOR FOR MY AUDIENCE. BUT HERE'S WHAT EZEKIEL SAYS &quot;THE WORD OF THE LORD 'SON OF MAN, SET YOUR FACE OF MAGOG, THE PRINCE OF ROSH, MESHECH, AND TUBAL,'&quot; WE'RE GOING TO TRANSLATE THESE INTO THESE GEOGRAPHICAL IN JUST A MINUTE. &quot;THE PRINCE OF ROSH, MESHECH AND AND SAY: 'THUS SAYS THE LORD O GOG, PRINCE OF ROSH, MESHECH ABOUT AND PUT HOOKS INTO BRING YOU OUT, AND ALL YOUR ALL OF THEM SPLENDIDLY ATTIRED, AND SHIELD, ALL OF THEM AND HE NAMES THE NATIONS OF &quot;PERSIA, ETHIOPIA, AND PUT WITH SHIELD AND HELMET; &quot;WITH ALL ITS TROOPS; BETH-TOGARMAH,&quot; &quot;FROM THE REMOTE PARTS OF MANY PEOPLES WITH YOU.&quot; NOW RON, IF YOU PUT MODERN NAMES THAT EZEKIEL WAS TALKING ABOUT. IF YOU TRANSLATE INTO THOSE WHAT ARE THE NATIONS &gt;&gt;DR. RON RHODES: WELL, AS WE BUT ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORICAL IS RUSSIA. WE DON'T SAY THAT WE SAY THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE ACTUAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALL IN VARIOUS CAVES AND SO FORTH, REFERRING TO WORDS VERY SIMILAR TO ROSH, WHICH POINT TO TODAY. AS WELL, IN EZEKIEL 38 THE UTTERMOST NORTH OF ISRAEL. AND WHEN YOU DRAW A LINE WELL, YOU COME UPON RUSSIA. SO, THERE'S PRETTY GOOD &gt;&gt; ANKERBERG: YES. GO TO MAGOG. &gt;&gt;RHODES: WELL, MAGOG OF RUSSIA. IF YOU CAN IMAGINE GO A LITTLE BIT SOUTH WHERE THE BLACK SEA THERE ARE MOUNTAINOUS AROUND THESE LAKES, AND &gt;&gt; ANKERBERG: YES. LET ME READ YOUR BOOK: KAZAKHSTAN, TAJIKISTAN, TURKMENISTAN, KYRGYZSTAN, AND UZBEKISTAN. THAT'S THE LAND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. &gt;&gt;RHODES: WELL, THAT'S RIGHT. IF YOU HIT THE CASPIAN SEA AND JUST GO DIRECTLY EAST, YOU'VE GOT KAZAKHSTAN, AND THEN DUE SOUTH IS UZBEKISTAN, AND THEN DUE SOUTH OF THAT IS TURKMENISTAN. ALL OF THESE ARE ISLAMIC. &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: YES. &gt;&gt;RHODES: AND THAT MEANS A MOTIVE TO JOIN IRAN AND AGAINST ISRAEL. &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: HOW ABOUT MESHECH? &gt;&gt;RHODES: WELL, MESHECH AND BETH-TOGARMAH, NOW, WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU, TURKEY IS GOING TO BE A IN FACT, AS WE'RE GOING TO SEE, ARE THE BIGGIES WHEN &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: YES. &gt;&gt;RHODES: WELL, SPEAKING &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: YES. &gt;&gt;RHODES: ...PERSIA IS IRAN. IN FACT, PERSIA BECAME IRAN BACK ABOUT THAT. BUT YOU'VE ALSO AND YOU'VE GOT ETHIOPIA, NOW ALL OF THESE ARE ISLAMIC, WITH RUSSIA AGAINST ISRAEL. AND, BY THE WAY, JOHN, THERE THE RUSSIANS JOINING WITH AGAINST ISRAEL. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER BACK IN AND OTHER MUSLIM COUNTRIES GUESS WHO PROVIDED THE WEAPONS? IT WAS RUSSIA. &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: YES. HEY FOLKS THIS IS I JUST WANTED TO TAKE AND THANK YOU FOR OUR ENTIRE MINISTRY IS BECAUSE OF VIEWERS LIKE YOU. NOW, IF YOU LIKE THIS PLEASE LET US KNOW BY AND IF YOU WANT TO KEEP CLICK THE SUBSCRIBE BUTTON FOR NEW EPISODES. WHETHER YOU WATCH US ON OR HERE ON YOUTUBE AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MAKE AN IMPACT CLICK THE LINK IN THE NOW LETS GET BACK TO SO, FOLKS, GET THIS LIST RUSSIA, IRAN, TURKEY, SUDAN, LIBYA, KAZAKHSTAN, TAJIKISTAN, TURKMENISTAN, KYRGYZSTAN, UZBEKISTAN, AND POSSIBLY AFGHANISTAN, ALGERIA, TUNISIA, &quot;AND MANY NATIONS WITH YOU.&quot; NOW, MARK, IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE NATIONS TODAY, WHEN GOD GAVE HIM THIS INFORMATION, SAY 2500-2600 DIDN'T EVEN KNOW EACH OTHER. AND YET TODAY, WHEN YOU WROTE WHEN, YOU SAID WHEN YOU CAME TRANSLATED ALL THIS STUFF, AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ALL OF RUSSIA HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH - &gt;&gt;DR. MARK HITCHCOCK: YES. &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: YOU SAID WHAT DID YOU REALIZE? &gt;&gt;HITCHCOCK: WELL, FIRST OF THE PROPHET EZEKIEL WROTE THIS OVER 2500 YEARS AGO. TO ME, THAT'S JUST A POWERFUL CONFIRMATION OF THE INSPIRATION, THE INERRANCY, OF THE BIBLE. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, NO ONE BUT GOD CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE LIKE THAT. AND WHAT WE SEE HAPPENING TODAY IS REALLY THE STAGE BEING SET FOR THIS INVASION. BECAUSE YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW, THESE NATIONS ARE OF COURSE, WITH RUSSIA, THEY'RE IN THE NEWS EVERY DAY. AND WE SEE THAT THE KIND OF AGAINST ISRAEL, WE SEE THAT THAT THEY'RE TAKING WITH UKRAINE OTHER NATIONS IN THE FUTURE. SO, WE SEE THESE NATIONS WITH ONE ANOTHER. YOU KNOW, RUSSIA HAS TROOPS THEY HAVE TROOPS IN SUDAN. &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: THEY'VE GOT &gt;&gt;HITCHCOCK: YES, IN SYRIA; IN SYRIA RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TODAY MORE PARALLEL TO WHAT WE SEE IN OUR WORLD TODAY. AND AGAIN, EZEKIEL PREDICTS THIS, AND ALL OF THIS IS COMING ALL THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN GOING TO NEED TO BE A MATCH TO SET ALL THIS IN MOTION. &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: AND, JEFF, TALK TO THE MATCH BEING LIT, OF SAY, ISRAEL AND IRAN, AND THEN HOW IRAN WOULD INTO GOING AGAINST ISRAEL. &gt;&gt;JEFF KINLEY: YES, IT'S SO EASY TO DO, BECAUSE THE MIDDLE EAST RIGHT NOW IS JUST A POWDER KEG. IT'S A SIMMERING CAULDRON READY TO BOIL OVER AT ANY TIME. ALL IT TAKES IS JUST ONE SPARK TO CAUSE THIS WAR TO HAPPEN. NOW, KEEP IN MIND, WRITTEN BY THE PROPHET AND PEOPLE LOOK BACK AND SAY, &quot;WELL, WASN'T THAT FULFILLED WELL, NO. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A WAR LIKE THIS IN BIBLICAL HISTORY. AND FOR THE PAST 2,000 YEARS, FOR THERE TO BE A WAR THIS PROPHECY MUST BE FUTURE. NOW, CONCERNING THE TIMING OF IT, WE LOOK AT WHAT HE SAYS IT'LL HAPPEN IN THE LAST ISRAEL IS &quot;LIVING SECURELY.&quot; SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PASSAGE. SO, ISRAEL HAS TO BE LIVING THEY HAVE TO FEEL SECURE. WHAT WOULD CAUSE THAT TO HAPPEN? WE BELIEVE THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF PEACE TREATY STRUCK IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO ENABLE ISRAEL TO FEEL THAT WAY, AND THEN EMBOLDEN COUNTRIES LIKE IRAN, LIKE RUSSIA, WHO'S ALREADY MOVING SOUTH WITH UKRAINE, TO FEEL LIKE THEY CAN MOVE IN AND TAKE THAT CHARGE. &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: YES. I ACTUALLY INTERVIEWED NETANYAHU AND REUVEN RIVLIN, WHO IS THE HEAD OF THE KNESSET. AND WHEN I WAS THERE, IT WAS QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO, AND NETANYAHU GAVE A QUICK PARAGRAPH OF WHAT THEY WERE SURROUNDED WITH. AND HE TOLD ME ON THE NORTHERN BORDER, THEY HAD LIKE, OH, 7,000-10,000 ROCKETS THAT WERE POINTED RIGHT AT ISRAEL. DOWN IN THE GAZA STRIP THERE WAS ONLY ABOUT 5,000. WELL, TODAY IT'S OVER 150,000 ROCKETS POINTED AT ISRAEL FROM THE NORTH, AND THERE'S MAYBE 15,000-20,000 DOWN IN GAZA. NOW, THE IRON DOME SYSTEM, WHICH IS THE UMBRELLA THAT CAN SHOOT DOWN MOST OF THESE BUT IF THEY ALL LAUNCHED IRON DOME COULDN'T HANDLE THAT, SO THEN SOME ARE GOING NOW, WE'RE ALREADY HEARING WORDS FROM NETANYAHU NOW, WHO'S COME BACK INTO POWER, HE'S ALREADY MADE STATEMENTS ABOUT IRAN AND THE BUILDUP OF THEIR NUCLEAR POWER. NOW, WHEN TRUMP WAS PRESIDENT, HE TOLD THEM, &quot;YOU CAN'T BUILD THAT UP ANY HIGHER,&quot; AND THE WORLD AGREED WITH HIM. SINCE TRUMP HAS BEEN GONE, THE FACT IS THAT THEY HAVE STARTED REBUILDING OF RUSSIA AND OTHERS. AND SO, THEIR NUCLEAR STOCKPILE IS GOING UP. AND ISRAEL IS SAYING, &quot;IF IT GETS TO A CERTAIN POINT, WE'RE GOING TO SEND ENOUGH POWER YOUR WAY TO DESTROY IT.&quot; WELL, THAT COULD BE THE MATCH. BECAUSE IF THEY DID THAT, THINK OF WHAT IRAN COULD SAY TO ALL OF ITS ARAB BUDDIES THAT WANT TO DESTROY ISRAEL. THEY COULD SAY, &quot;GUYS, WE WERE ATTACKED. AND WE NEED YOUR HELP. AND I THINK IF WE ALL GET WE COULD GET IT DONE.&quot; AND THEN, THE BIBLE SAYS, RON, INTO THE MOUTH OF RUSSIA &gt;&gt;RHODES: YES. &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: AND I THINK THAT THEY WANT TO DO THAT THEY HAVE SUPPLIED SO MUCH STUFF SO MUCH TO THE ARAB NATIONS ALL THEM, INCLUDING THE PALESTINIANS THAT IT WOULD BE REALLY HARD TO GO WITH THE REST OF THESE THAT THEY'VE BEEN SUPPLYING REALLY BE TOUGH FOR THEM TO SAY, AND IT SAYS THERE'S A MILITARY TO LEAD THE COALITION, IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE ISRAEL YOU'VE GOT TOO MANY NATIONS. YOU'VE GOT A SMALL NATION SOME MILES FROM THE TOP TO IS NOT THAT BIG. &gt;&gt;RHODES: RIGHT. &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: AND YOU GOT ALL THEIR MILITARY MIGHT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A DONE DEAL, BUT WHAT DOES GOD SAY &gt;&gt;RHODES: WELL, GOD THAT'S THE SHORT STORY. BUT THE BIG STORY IS REALLY EXCITING. I SAY THAT BECAUSE, WHEN THIS INVASION TAKES PLACE, ISRAEL IS SO OUTNUMBERED THAT THERE'S NO WAY THAT ISRAEL BUT GOD DECIDES TO ACT. AND WHEN GOD ACTS, HE SENDS THAT KILLS MANY OF THEM; HE CAUSES FRIENDLY FIRE I SUSPECT BETWEEN THE &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: THIS IS &gt;&gt;RHODES: THAT'S RIGHT. AND &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: PLAGUES. &gt;&gt;RHODES: GOD IS IN SOVEREIGN AND HE BRINGS ABOUT ALL OF THESE FORCES. AND HERE'S WHAT'S EXCITING &quot;THAT YOU MAY KNOW YOU SEE, WHEN THESE FORCES ARE LIKELY SHOUTING &quot;ALLAHU AKBAR&quot; BECAUSE THEY'RE MUSLIMS. &quot;THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT NONE LIKE ME IN ALL THE EARTH.&quot; AND SO, THEY'RE NO MATCH AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: YES. &gt;&gt;RHODES: ...GOD &quot;NO WEAPON... AGAINST &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: RIGHT. &gt;&gt;RHODES: AND SCRIPTURE &quot;HE WHO WATCHES ISRAEL WILL &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt;RHODES: AND SO, &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: MARK, WAS THAT WHEN YOU REALIZED ALL THIS? &gt;&gt;HITCHCOCK: WELL, YES. YOU SEE ALL THIS COMING TOGETHER. THE STAGE IS BEING SET;... &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: NOW. &gt;&gt;HITCHCOCK: ...THE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE ARE FALLING INTO PLACE RIGHT NOW. IT'S ALL THERE. YOU KNOW, WHAT'S INTERESTING THAT'S BEAUTIFUL ABOUT WE CAN KNOW FOR SURE THIS IS BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING BUT IN EZEKIEL 36 AND 37, THE TWO CHAPTERS BEFORE THAT, OF ISRAEL FROM ALL THE NATIONS TO THEIR HOMELAND. WELL, WE'RE SEEING THE FULFILLMENT OF SO, IF THAT PROPHECY HAS AND WE SEE IT BEING WE KNOW THAT THE EZEKIEL 38-39 PROPHECY WILL BE FULFILLED. WE DON'T HAVE TO JUST, THERE'S A TRACK RECORD THAT THESE PROPHECIES. AND SO, WHEN WE SEE THESE THINGS ISRAEL BACK IN THE LAND; ISRAEL LIVING IN PEACE MAYBE IN THE FUTURE THIS TREATY WITH THE ANTICHRIST, THEY'LL BE LIVING SECURELY; AND IRAN'S TRYING TO CROSS AND BOTH THE UNITED STATES &quot;WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET SO THERE'S A SHOWDOWN AND WHENEVER THAT SHOWDOWN ALL THESE THINGS ARE GOING THIS PROPHECY WILL BE FULFILLED. &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: THE PROPHECY ALSO JUST DESTROY THE ARMIES THAT IN ISRAEL, BUT HE'S GOING BACK TO TAKE OUT CERTAIN PIECES TALK TO THAT ONE. &gt;&gt;RHODES: WELL, I THINK THAT GOD'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT HE'S TAKEN OUT THE MADRASAS AND ISLAM, AND THE SCHOOLS, AND HEADQUARTERS OF LEADERS WHO MAKE ISRAEL. SO, I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION GOD'S JUDGMENT IS COMPLETE. &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: JEFF, I'M GOING TO &gt;&gt;KINLEY: YES. &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: PEOPLE SAY, &quot;WHEN'S THIS GOING TO HAPPEN?&quot; THEN, IF GOD TAKES OUT ALL OF AGAINST ISRAEL RIGHT NOW THAT IT POSSIBLE FOR THE JEWS IN BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU'VE GOT ONE OF THE HOLIEST, THIRD IT MIGHT NOT BE THERE. &gt;&gt;KINLEY: ABSOLUTELY. WE'VE ALL WALKED THAT SITE THIS IS A HOLY SITE TO GOING TO ALLOW ISRAEL TO BUILD THAT TEMPLE UNLESS SOMETHING HAPPENS TO DECIMATE THE ISLAMIC MILITARY FORCES. THAT HAS TO TAKE PLACE. &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: YES. &gt;&gt;KINLEY: AND SO, THAT ENABLES TO COME IN AND STRIKE A PEACE TO BUILD THAT TEMPLE, WHICH TIME. BUT HERE'S THE THING. KEEP IN MIND, GOD IS HE'S PRE-SCRIPTED HISTORY. I LOVE WHAT EVANGELIST WILLIAM BLACKSTONE SAYS. HE SAYS, &quot;ISRAEL IS GOD'S SUNDIAL.&quot; AND WHEN WE LOOK AT ISRAEL, WE CAN TELL THE TIME, AND TELL WHERE WE ARE ON HISTORY'S TIME PERIOD. &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: YES. &gt;&gt;KINLEY: AND SO, THAT WE PAY ATTENTION TO ISRAEL. &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: ALL RIGHT, MARK, PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW, WHEN'S WHERE DOES THE RAPTURE &gt;&gt;HITCHCOCK: WELL, MY VIEW IS EVENT ON GOD'S PROPHETIC THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. IT CAN HAPPEN AT &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: THAT'S WHERE &gt;&gt;HITCHCOCK: THAT'S RIGHT. JESUS IS GOING TO COME BACK. THOSE WHO HAVE DIED ARE GOING ARE ALIVE ON EARTH, BELIEVERS, TO MEET THE LORD IN THE AIR. THAT'S THE NEXT EVENT ON SOMETIME AFTER THE RAPTURE, TAKE PLACE. IT COULD BE BEFORE BEFORE THAT SEVEN-YEAR OR IT COULD BE AFTER THE SCENE AND MAKES THIS A GUARANTEED PEACE FOR THEM. BECAUSE IT DOES SAY WHEN ONE OF THE PRECONDITIONS IS AND LIVING SECURELY. SO THERE'S AMONG BIBLE TEACHERS, PROPHECY TEACHERS, ABOUT THE EXACT TIMING OF THE GOG-MAGOG INVASION. BUT WE KNOW THAT IT'S FUTURE; WE KNOW THAT IT'S AFTER THE RAPTURE OF THE CHURCH TAKES PLACE. &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: IT ALSO TELLS US TO BE PRETTY NEAR. &gt;&gt;HITCHCOCK: WELL, THAT'S RIGHT. THE SIGNS OF THE TRIBULATION SO, IF WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THE RAPTURE MUST BE VERY SOON. &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: AND, RON, FOR THIS FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME, HE'S GOING TO TAKE ALL AND ONLY UNBELIEVERS ARE LEFT. AND SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING, "HEY, I DIDN'T KNOW THIS BEFORE. I'D LIKE TO INVITE JESUS INTO MY LIFE. I'D LIKE HIM TO FORGIVE MY SINS. AND I'D LIKE YOU TO SAY A PRAYER &quot;I UNDERSTAND THE FACT THAT I HAVEN'T MADE THAT DECISION. I HAVEN'T RECEIVED HIM I HAVEN'T ASKED HIM BUT I'M WILLING BECAUSE JESUS SAYS HE'LL SAVE AND HE'LL COME INTO YOUR LIFE, HE'LL GIVE YOU NEW POWER WOULD YOU SAY A PRAYER FOR AND WOULD LIKE TO DO IT TODAY? SAY IT RIGHT NOW &gt;&gt;RHODES: ABSOLUTELY. YOU CAN'T MAKE ANY PROMISES HIS PROMISES CAN SAVE YOU. AND HE PROMISES TO FORGIVE SO, PRAY ALONG WITH ME. &quot;DEAR JESUS, I THANK YOU FOR YOU TOOK MY PLACE. YOU TOOK THE PUNISHMENT THAT I KNOW THAT I'VE SINNED I KNOW THAT I'VE DONE THINGS I KNOW THAT I'VE OFFENDED YOU. BUT I REJOICE THAT I CAN YOUR DEATH ON THE CROSS. YOU'VE PROMISED IN JOHN 1:12 INTO MY HEART, THAT IF THAT YOU WILL FORGIVE INTO YOUR ETERNAL FAMILY. PLEASE GUIDE ME AS HELP ME TO TAKE MY NEXT STEPS.&quot; NOW, IF YOU PRAYED THAT PRAYER YOU'RE NOW IN THE FAMILY &gt;&gt;ANKERBERG: YES. I WANT YOU I'VE GOT A PERSONAL WORD WHAT THE GUYS ARE GOING THAT YOU WON'T WANT TO MISS; HAS TO DO WITH JEFF'S BOOK, ARE WE AT THE POINT WHERE WE'RE AT THE END OF AMERICA? AND SO, STICK WITH ME. I'LL TALK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT MORE IN JUST A MOMENT.
