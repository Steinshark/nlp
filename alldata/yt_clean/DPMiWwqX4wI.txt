You are safe behind your shields, and the orcs are going on your pointy sticks. And then the elves just decide, no, instead we'll jump in front of that and put ourselves needlessly into danger. My name is Roel Konijnendijk. I teach ancient history at You might remember me from part one. Today, we'll be looking in modern movies and TV and Nock! Draw! Loose! Soldiers: Loose! All these movies do this. They all have these archers lined up. They give these sequences, &quot;nock, draw, loose,&quot; over and over again, but this never happened. You don't order them to shoot in volleys. When you order everyone some of these guys are and they're not going to be effective. Others are going to be like, this is too slow for me. I can shoot faster than this. There were no orders to [shields dropping] The coordination required to do this is completely impossible. There were battle formations where you would have shield walls in front and then spears sticking out to sort of drive the enemy back. Obviously the Macedonian pikemen are the big famous example. There are Mesopotamian examples from way back, 2000 BC. It wouldn't work like this, though. You couldn't really form them in a circle. They would form up in blocks, and they would maneuver in blocks. And that's hard enough. [men chanting] Once you're fully surrounded, I mean, there's nothing You're in big trouble. You can try to break the spears. Persians are known to do Their spears are longer, so they literally went up and snapped them in half by hand, but that's a desperation move, and it doesn't really get you anywhere. If you're in an encirclement like that, of a proper pike formation, then you're just doomed. [gasping] Crushes in battle do happen. But most of the time when into a small space and it's because they're trying to run away and they can't escape, or a ravine or a wall, The panic of a trample, they do depict that pretty well. [men shouting] When horses turn up unexpectedly, especially behind the infantry line, you would give up and run. There is almost no chance that that formation would hold. The very unrealistic thing in this scene is that no one knew It's possible to hide, you know, small units in woods or hollow roads or behind some geographical feature. But a large force of cavalry is going to throw up a lot of dust. It's going to make a lot of noise. It's going to, you know, scare the birds and the animals. You know this is coming. I think this one does an interesting job of trying to give you the sort of visceral horror of a battle. And I really do appreciate that. The tactics are nonsense, but it does give a sense of desperation of some of these struggles. So maybe 5 out of 10, 6 out of 10. [horn sounding] That big horn is supposed And in that sense, it can work. A lot of troops before battle would try and sing songs together, just like sports teams So that kind of thing That shouldn't be confused with the idea of using it to give orders. That's a separate thing. The Romans were very good at that. They had a number of and the troops all knew, like, if you hear this signal, you have to do different things. But for instance, the Greeks, I mean, they had one big trumpet. When it sounded, you charge. If it sounds again, Why would you do that? [laughs] Like, why would they try to get the cavalry to slide over the shield wall into their own formation? You want the cavalry to because at the moment the cavalry stops and is stuck in front of your spear wall, they lose all their advantages. They're not mobile anymore. They don't have that momentum anymore. The elves clearly have a and then they just duck under it and let the cavalry slide over it. What? [laughs] I don't know why. I don't know what they were doing. Both the elves and the dwarves in this one have this double-layered shield wall. There are battle formations where you would try to stop cavalry by building these This is based on a late where you'd put your infantry and double shield wall or But in most battles, it's it removes all your opportunities to maneuver or to move. You wouldn't want to do that unless you were absolutely sure what the enemy was going to do was going to be running straight into you. If there was anything else they might do, you want to keep your flexibility by keeping your lines separated and just rely on a single wall of shields, because that will do most of the time. If you've got a static defense, you have your spear wall, the orcs are charging straight into it with no sense of self-preservation, that's exactly what you You are safe behind your shields, and the orcs are going on your pointy sticks. All you wanted to have is for that to be exactly like that until the orcs stop coming. And then the elves just decide, no, instead we'll jump in front of that and put ourselves needlessly into danger so that we can fight It makes no sense. It serves no purpose. [shouting] Wedge formations are debated because, on the one hand, we have a lot of sources saying that wedge formations existed, but it's not entirely certain Because most of what you're doing is just putting one guy at the front who's going to be exposed to everyone in the enemy line. So unless you've already made a hole, that wedge is not going It's just actually going to put you in a really dangerous position where you're feeding your men one at a time into the enemy. With cavalry, it's not It's showing you some interesting but otherwise, like, 4 out of 10. So, this is Kubrick trying to visualize a real Roman battle formation, which is this three which, going into battle, they would actually try We're not actually sure how this worked. It's also possible that in these checkerboards, to sort of withdraw between and sort of maneuver in and out. When the front was getting tired or when it was suffering and when it couldn't get through, you'd just pull them back which would consist of And then they would have a go. This is just an enormous mob of guys, much too deep to serve any purpose. Like, get in formation! Oh, no, it landed on him! [laughs] Like, it bounced over the one and landed on the other guy. Oh, I hope he got his paycheck. [laughs] Killed by a massive flaming corn dog. Excellent work. Hollywood just likes fire. They just want to have They want to throw big balls of fire, and they want to have rollers of fire and balls of fire to disrupt formations. It seems to work in theory, because you want these In that sense, it makes tactical sense. The casualty rate of these battles in Hollywood is ridiculous. The result is always that everyone dies. This is just not how battles work. You have a certain number and when they start to see that things are going against them, or especially when they they're going to retreat. They're going to get out of there, and then they'll see what happens next. Or if the enemy is running away and they're being chased by cavalry, that's when you see the But in these formation battles, most of the time casualties 6 out of 10 for trying. It must've been an enormous effort to try and get all these And then they get rolled That's a missed opportunity. That poor guy. I hope he's well. I hope he's still around. Hold the ranks! Hold the ranks! I kill you myself! Battles on ice did happen. There's, very famously, there's the Battle on the Ice, which is a battle in which the Republic of Novgorod warded off the Teutonic Knights. And so there was a because, obviously, in many parts, if you're fighting in winter, the ice offers a nice flat space where you can maneuver easily. I mean, archers would based on what kind of bow they were using, what kind of arrow they were using, and of course their individual Any kind of effective too much affected by the wind. It doesn't necessarily matter that much where they end up, as some force when they land. Aim for the wings of the ranks. Make them cluster. I really like it, actually, that they use the arrows So they use these arrows around the edges to drive the enemy into a narrow space, where his numbers are negated. That would genuinely So we say 6 out of 10. OK, so you've got a huge line at the back, and then there's another line much closer. So, there's, like, a What is the line in the back even doing? It's going to take you 15 minutes just to walk into the battle. This is the worst example You have big armies, but they Slashing left and right. No one knows what's going on. There's no formations. It seems like there has no planning whatsoever. Everybody just gets together in a big mob and then slams into each other. This is such a weird scene, because you see heads and then suddenly, when the there's a nice little pause, and nobody will bother while she mourns this guy. It's very nice of them to let her do that. If you turn away from the fighting and drop your weapon somebody's going to shank you. This is obviously something which is totally understandable. It's 1 out of 10. It's a complete disaster I don't want to keep You should be digging ditches! Many ditches. Once your first ditch is Dig many ditches. Just lots and lots of ditches. Again, where is your ditch? Where is your ditch?! You've got to have a ditch! It shows the strength of because the horses aren't going to try and go into those ditches. They're going to try to and that allows you to force the enemy into where you want to fight them. So that is actually a very, of how ditches are supposed to work and how a very simple can actually help you enormously. Come down here! Straight through! Any way you can! This is an absolute massacre. This depiction of the battle, it's reasonably accurate, according to the accounts that survive. So, we know that this was fought in a deliberately narrow space. They chose a place that so that the enemy cavalry, would have to funnel itself along one small, narrow causeway. If you're a cavalry, you want flat ground, because then you can move In the movies, everybody slams together, and then it's just a huge melee. Obviously in real life, there's only a few men and the rest are just kind of waiting for their turn, more or less. And especially if you're in where you're funneled So they chose their terrain really well. And that meant that even though the English had numerical advantage, they couldn't use it. Retreat! Retreat! There's no winning here! For this kind of battle, it is realistic, in the sense that they're just shouting and hoping that the men and then those men will This is obviously not a perfect system. So he would just hope that everybody would follow his example most of the time. So it explains the but there are some other problems. All the infantry has too much armor, and all the horses have not enough armor. 7 out of 10. So, this is Alexander's battle against the Indians at the Hydaspes, which is in modern-day Pakistan. It wasn't fought in a wood, it was fought on the banks of a river, which Alexander had crossed in the night. So, for Alexander in particular, his cavalry is his trump card. He wants to be able to use his cavalry. And that means he wants He wants to be able to and he wants them to In a wood, there's too You can't maintain your Effective heavy cavalry also works in quite tight formations. Like, these horses are If you want to use that effectively, you can't obviously go through trees. So he would try to avoid them. All of his major battles tend to be fought on the banks of rivers or in open plains. This was the big battle where Alexander first And they're depicting this, you know, part of this, really well. Horses don't like animals they don't know. You run your elephants at them, and if they haven't seen them before, if they haven't gotten used to each other, then the horses are You can see these elephants sort of barging into these and everybody's like, &quot;What are these? How do we stop these?&quot; But actually, Alexander won The fact is that once you're and you have troops that it's quite easy to drive off elephants simply by throwing missiles at them, trying to get rid of their riders, and panicking them so and run and trample their own men, which is very often what would But at least, you know, the equipments, the tactics of the individual warriors and all that is accurate. 7 out of 10. So, hollow square is a real formation. It would be used on the march. If you were afraid that the enemy might ambush they would be able to depending on where the threat So, chariots are a feature They're meant to carry around people who are shooting arrows, who are throwing javelins, and usually in very large numbers. But as soon as you have mounted cavalry and you've mastered the art of firing missiles from horseback, the chariot is essentially obsolete. It has no real advantages over just having lots of men on horseback, because they're more flexible. So chariots in the course of antiquity just kind of go out of style. I would give it, like, 5 out of 10. Take position! It's actually nice to see a The Roman empire obviously stretched across the Mediterranean into Africa, all over Europe. So you would actually different skin colors, So, they dug a ditch, It does happen. It can be done. There is at least one where the enemy has a cavalry and the defenders have prepared the ground by burying these pots in the ground, just big vases, and then hiding them, so that when the cavalry charges, they fall into the pots So this kind of hidden trap isn't completely unheard of, but it couldn't be done on this scale, because you would see it. Right? I mean, the effort it would take to hide a ditch on that massive scale is just incomprehensible. And they would know that because you didn't just that day and started digging, right? The Roman side would [laughing] Goofy scene first making a nice defensive ditch and then ignoring it and jumping over it. You've made all that effort. You've neutralized the enemy. That was your goal, right? Why did you then go back over it? If that was your plan all along, why dig the ditch in the first place? It's just a silly, silly big fight. 1 out of 10. Don't run! We hold formation! These are shields that are designed for shield-wall formations. They were even standing shields, so tower shields which in battle to form a Usually you would use that to set up your defensive barrier, your bulwark, behind which you would then have archers, for instance, to fire at the enemy and try to get them to attack So there are lots of different that have used these kind with very large, very heavy shields. And then in the medieval period, they become more popular because where you start to get -- your armor and your small So you need these big when you're doing things like reloading your own crossbow. So you get these kind of pavises, these big tower shields. Fire! They're setting up a Like, very slowly, inevitably, because it's very heavy And then you have to move these big balls, and they actually make a point of showing how heavy they are. You're not going to be able Like, it's going to have All that time, they're just exposed, and you're standing there. If you get hit by these balls, you have no one to blame but yourself. [laughs] It's giving you every opportunity to do something about it, but instead, you're just Well, tactically, it's very bad. [laughs] They do have some of the equipment right. 4 out of 10. Thanks very much for watching. I hope you enjoyed that. And if you did, you can which you can find here.
