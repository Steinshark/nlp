You are aware of being conscious. But are you aware of being aware? There is a difference. This is the hair's breadth of difference From being at peace to being Being aware of consciousness is the flow of experiences, always While being aware of being aware is what This is the realization that what Precisely that. Nothing more and nothing less. Consciousness is usually of And the perception of a phenomena is always necessarily from a specific So, this type of consciousness Because the phenomena being observed the observer of the phenomena This is the duality of subject and object that From what is considered the normal view, self is something that happens to be From this view, all sorts of theories abound on what theself actually is -- a person, a soul, the body, the brain. At its core there is always the belief a sentient entity, that is separate When trying to comprehend the the best the mind can come up with is that we are But that is clearly an obvious contradiction. This is the mind refusing to To go all the way is to arrive which destroys all such talk and beliefs Just baseless. Ignorant of the fundamental nature of Reality. Of the way things actually are. To be aware of consciousness is just A state of constant flux. Consciousness is the state of movement. Prior to consciousness, there is just stillness. But both stillness and movement are included To be aware of being aware is the direct and in the same breath what This is the only standpoint Indivisible and without parts. Without a trace of any separate This is the only standpoint where Where the constant struggle of likes and Moksha; Liberation, is a description of what this present stream of consciousness is As awareness being aware. It is a stepping back from the relative contents of consciousness; of perceptions But there's nothing to step back into The awareness of being aware. Everything else is relative. Firstly, you are aware. Only then you become Your gaze gets hooked onto these contents. That is what attention is -- awareness of So, honing attention into a fine edge doesn't have That usually only makes you more acutely There may be some use of that early In turning attention to the fundamental &quot;What am I?&quot; The answer to this question is what the The answer cannot be presented by thought or experience, but only through In this stepping back, it can be seen the ground truth of what you are. To be aware of being aware is to And also as the Heart -- The thoughts will ask how to do it. But aren't you already aware? Apart from the contents of consciousness, besides you are also aware of the fact of being aware. Only the significance of this Because the mind is not aware! The mind is just a stream of experiences. The thoughts and feelings based on those So, the best the stream can come up with and from that ideas of some higher power or truth. All of those spiritual experiences are And all the while You are there! Aware of these conceptions. Just purely aware: Aware-ness. There is no higher power than this This quality that is so natural to you, so truly you, inseparable from The mind can only flip between Ignoring &quot;it&quot;, or conceiving of &quot;it&quot; as God. The mind can only attempt to objectify You. But You are not an object. You're not an &quot;it&quot; or a &quot;that&quot;. Let's clear this up right now. Are you aware of being aware? What did you just use to check that? Which way did the mind turn? Consider this question again slowly and see what Are you aware of being aware? Which way did attention turn? The affirmation doesn't come Not in the first instance. Thought may step in later. But notice what took place just before that. Are you aware? To answer this question you don't You turn to your own innate This is being aware of being aware! Away from the mind and back to the Source. Knowing yourself as Awareness itself. Any idea of you being a person or entity that somehow possesses awareness A fact that was just verified through Jnana. Knowledge that didn't make use of thoughts, This fact of being aware was That is how simple and natural this is. One step back, one hair's breadth away to just being aware of being aware. Step back often. Stay here often. Till it is clear what the Self is. What you actually are. Beyond all the theories, and thoughts, what you actually are, as a Not a body, nor the brain, not the All these are vague concepts You have been fighting shadows. Now look at what is demonstrably real, Since you are pure Awareness, You are, by nature, absolutely free. Now, as you look upon the same relative stream of consciousness from this Advaita! You see no separate subjects nor Ajanma! Unborn. Uncreated. Intrinsic and most natural. Only from here it can be said: The Self is All, and All is the Self.
