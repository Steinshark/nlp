I mean, this is a huge amount &gt;&gt; If you weren't following that the low-income housing &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Tonight,<i> Frontline </i> at &quot;Poverty, Politics &gt;&gt; LAURA SULLIVAN: I never about low-income housing would to an upscale resort Los Suenos is a dream world, with fancy condominiums and a first-class hotel, and its own private marina. I'd come here because our investigation to house the poor had of secret bank accounts But I'm getting ahead of myself. To understand what brought me to back nine months earlier, &gt;&gt; As our city grows, the doing the opposite. It's shrinking. &gt;&gt; Some are calling it the worst in U.S. history. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Last year, we in neighborhoods like this, where &quot;making rent&quot; has been &gt;&gt; The struggle is real I mean, you know, this is, It'll wear you down, you know, because you're seeing it &gt;&gt; People's rent checks have and up, and I don't see &gt;&gt; These are people who have &gt;&gt; How y'all doing? &gt;&gt; They're saying that no matter they still can't find to put a roof over their head. &gt;&gt; Well, this is the eviction. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: There are more every year. &gt;&gt; She's supposed to pay $400. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: An estimated 2 1/2 &gt;&gt; Yeah, get, get a couple You can go ahead and start &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: average household incomes have while rents have been rising. And that's pushing more and more to the edge. So what happened to you today? &gt;&gt; I was at work. I work two full-time jobs. I'm trying. It's a struggle, and it's real Seriously, yes. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: How hard has it that you can afford? &gt;&gt; Horrible, it's freaking And that's how I ended up I didn't want to be here. I didn't want I don't have horrible credit, But it's just hard. It's just hard. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Like millions of are caught in the long wake of &gt;&gt; What happened when we hit is that all of a sudden, millions of families lost They became renters, competing in the same rental and at the same time, even if you could keep your job. And that led to a rental in this country that's as bad as &gt;&gt; Did he come with a dolly? &gt;&gt; We have over 11 million paying more than half of their each month. That means that they are, you one broken-down car, one missed day of work away from They are really at risk of and becoming homeless. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Every year, nearly $50 billion to help the and get them on the road Over the past year, the two key programs that try to whether they're working and why so many people are In Dallas, and elsewhere, how the largest of the programs, covers just a fraction &gt;&gt; Section 8 applications. Thousands of residents have been public housing assistance. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: When the vouchers the response is overwhelming. &gt;&gt; Chaos this morning in the over the city's plan to hand &gt;&gt; There are some people been Monday morning. It's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: The voucher pays between the monthly rent and More than two million but wait lists can be Well, how big a deal is it &gt;&gt; Only one in every four that are eligible for and in need of housing &gt;&gt; It was a dangerous scene. Thousands of people hoping ran for a spot in line. &gt;&gt; They're hoping to win what is essentially So it's the 25% who have the within this kind of a system. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: We wanted to see for three of the lucky ones in has a tight rental market. &gt;&gt; They should pick up &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Farryn Giles and at her ex-husband's apartment &gt;&gt; We got to walk kind of fast, to get to school in time You got to keep up. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: She's held a to Dallas seven years ago. &gt;&gt; I've been a cashier, I've been a caregiver, I've done clerical work, Oh, Mom made cupcakes &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: But even when to find a place she can afford. What did you think when you got &gt;&gt; I thought... I felt like it was an more stability. This area in general I would &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: What is it about of this neighborhood? &gt;&gt; Work. Work. I want to live near a place where there are better job You know, it took me six years You can best believe I'm going Yeah, hi, do you guys accept &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Linda Higgins says one unexpected event upended her that keeping jobs has been &gt;&gt; I was working at JC Penney, I started living with different not able to afford to pay rent. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: It sounds like means a lot to you. &gt;&gt; It does. I haven't had a place of my own &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Is it scary that it &gt;&gt; That's why I'm heading up &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: in a Wal-Mart parking C'Artis has seven kids and was but before that, she says they &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: You slept in here with seven kids for a couple &gt;&gt; It wasn't, like, all the At some point in time, we was. Like, in between, like, or other people's houses If it wasn't, like, panning out, we would, you know, go find in my van. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: What do you say They understand? Because they know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: They know Do you have an area you don't &gt;&gt; The 'hood, like, &quot;the 'hood.&quot; &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Why not? &gt;&gt; Why? Because I don't feel like I don't want nobody breaking trying to beat up my children You get into it with somebody, &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: You want out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like, I'm tired of it. Like, why wouldn't I want In fact, I went from an to living in a shelter, like... Yeah, I'm not going to go I'd rather go forward, you know? You going to press the button, You're going to press the button &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: We kept in touch as they tried to find a place They have up to 90 days And what they're hoping for of the Section 8 voucher the chance to move with better opportunities. &gt;&gt; Researchers from Harvard and and found conclusively, they're significantly more go to college, finish college, earn more money, not have not get involved in crime and the younger the kids are the bigger the impact. ZIP code is destiny. That's no joke. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: One of the hottest is the northern suburb Three years ago, it was ranked in America by Money magazine. Today, the area is booming. New apartments are popping up I was meeting a developer who's more low-income housing &gt;&gt; Hi! &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Hi, I'm Laura. &gt;&gt; Hi, Terri Anderson. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Terri Anderson has of affordable housing. &gt;&gt; Please, if you could put &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: She's building between McKinney and the Can we see it? &gt;&gt; Yes, let's go. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: what's this going to look like? &gt;&gt; There'll be two very large &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Anderson's plan is &gt;&gt; It's class-A construction and we're really &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Some market-rate, some at reduced or affordable for Section 8 vouchers. But her plan hit a roadblock &gt;&gt; We thought we were going the city actually called a and about 250 angry residents &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Some residents others about overcrowding &gt;&gt; Hi, nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: And some were just low-income housing Well, why did you pick Nicole Humphrey is a local What is your concern when and low-income? &gt;&gt; The lifestyle I feel, like, is usually working single, maybe struggling to keep their heads And it's not... I feel so bad saying that, It's just not people who are, I which sounds bad, but I don't &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Some people would &quot;Look, they maybe not, have not &quot;their kids are not going that your kids are going to have Can they share in that? &gt;&gt; The, the problem with that of, &quot;Oh, we haven't been given afforded things that you might I don't look at &quot;Why don't I have a yacht? Why don't I have a private jet?&quot; It's, it's a mindset, &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Do you think that the folks... &gt;&gt; Oh, I totally am, 100%. It's not... It works both ways. I, I'm definitely not a racist but I, I think I hold a little against people who are We don't want nomads. We don't want people who don't I just don't want that to be &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: A vote on whether she needed was brought before in March of 2015. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: The opponents won (attendees applaud) &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: But even without to line up loans and grants to Then, more problems. &gt;&gt; Our superintendent has been a criminal trespass warning. The police have actually &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Have you ever seen in the years that you've been &gt;&gt; I have not. &gt;&gt; There's an issue with some and the right of way. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Frisco city affordable housing and aren't Anderson's project. They just want her to comply Anderson complained to the Department of Housing which is now investigating whether her project is being &gt;&gt; It is a concerted effort of a property they do not want &gt;&gt; Move! Move! &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Two years ago, &gt;&gt; Get on the ground. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: A confrontation and black youth went viral. &gt;&gt; That girl right there, &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: The incident became over policing and race. (yelling) &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: But behind this over housing. &gt;&gt; What was happening you had white patrons of the &quot;Go back to your &gt;&gt; Then they started verbally to go back to my Section 8 home &gt;&gt; On your face! (yelling) &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: The McKinney pool of how inseparable housing and of federal policies that more than 80 years ago. &gt;&gt; In 1933, the Public Works public housing. And the important thing to segregated public housing in that had never known segregation &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Then, in the 1940s bankrolled a mass migration &gt;&gt; The Federal Housing single-family homes outside for white families only. &gt;&gt; Two-thirds of the people in a metropolitan area. Mostly the growth is &gt;&gt; At the same time, So poverty became making low-income segregated even more desperate economically than they had been previously. &gt;&gt; Are we going to sock it (protesters respond) Are you ready? &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: By the 1960s, boiled over. (chanting) Race riots swept the country. (yelling, sirens blaring) &gt;&gt; Segregation was something Most of the focus of civil in the South. But by the mid -60s, towards the North, segregation was the issue, housing segregation &gt;&gt; We want a strong fair the only thing that's going (people cheering) &gt;&gt; And so it's no mistake that been stalled in Congress, is passed just days after Martin &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: The act outlawed and went further. &gt;&gt; The Fair Housing Act was &quot;We're going to aggressively &quot;to create opportunities and to encourage local &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Within years, as conditions in public housing were enacted, like Section 8 &gt;&gt; So the Section 8 voucher assisting low-income people with their housing cost needs, So a household could take and move to a higher-income, &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Vouchers would help But as old public housing new affordable options And by the early 1990s, a new construction program, It was called the Low-Income And so the idea of the emerged as a way to create a new that would allow more affordable &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: The program would in private investment to remake It would also open the door and politics. So you both were interested Back in Dallas, I met the earliest to see opportunity Together, Brian and Cheryl some of the most successful in the country. &gt;&gt; I think at one time we were and the largest in the state. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: in the neglected neighborhoods areas where the demand for and the tax credit program was The Potashniks showed me The I.R.S. gives billions Then the states award And this is you guys. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Who sell them for The developers use the cash to And because taxpayer money pays the lower rents that are &gt;&gt; It's like when you buy a down payment. That's your equity. That's... The tax credits give us to build the apartment complex. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Could you build without tax credits? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No, and it wouldn't be of housing without the tax &gt;&gt; Dallas mayor Laura Miller cut &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: By the early making millions off their for new opportunities beyond &gt;&gt; You know, we didn't have for how we found land. We'd get in the car But we started driving north &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: And what did you &gt;&gt; We found a good site. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: That site was in What kind of pushback &gt;&gt; Just, uh... &quot;Hell, no, you can't come.&quot; &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Many argued that low-income housing But Betsy Julian, a leading says she heard other reasons in McKinney in 2003. &gt;&gt; I went to the ladies' room, and if you want to hear really go into the ladies' room &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: What were they &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not going to but they were talking about how would have to have Section 8. Because that's what they really &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: The Potashniks the opposition and negotiate &gt;&gt; We had hired a consultant who was also a lawyer. &gt;&gt; And a consultant. &gt;&gt; And a consultant, with the lieutenant governor, that we needed to hire another but we couldn't know who that &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: You had to hire allowed to know. &gt;&gt; To lobby the governor. &gt;&gt; We would get calls &quot;Look, I know the governor, I know this one, and I can help I mean, it, just rampant. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: It's just, &quot;Pay me about how I do it.&quot; &gt;&gt; Right, don't ask. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Don't ask. Their deal fell through. And their development plans to that didn't want low-income generated broader opposition. Soon, Texas began requiring from local and state officials tax credit deals done. What did that mean for the a letter of support? &gt;&gt; It basically meant that if that property was not going &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: The letters of more power to determine the fate so the Potashniks doubled down the political buy-in &gt;&gt; Developer Brian Potashnik when it comes to meeting for 30,000 &gt;&gt; So I found myself spending talking to a lot of politicians. &gt;&gt; It all began years ago... &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Getting those a high-stakes political game, including the Potashniks, in a bribery and corruption the largest in Dallas City Hall &gt;&gt; Experts say it suggests the through a conspiracy for &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: It was You were accused of being Why did you do it? &gt;&gt; If you want to use that term, and especially when the system so that you need those people to that you're doing &gt;&gt; There was a lot of pressure of different places. Certain decisions were made, We should have walked away at We, and we should have those, those projects that were and just gone in a different But, you know, we didn't. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: They pleaded guilty to conspiracy to bribe &gt;&gt; Brian Potashnik dashed away of 14 months in prison. His wife, Cheryl, was given two as this Dallas City Hall draws to a close. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Nearly 20 states to help decide which projects Civil rights lawyers, say that's a major end up in low-income Why were the tax credit in low-income areas? &gt;&gt; They were being put there There won't be any opposition everybody mad at you. You get your deals done. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: After examining they calculated that more than in Dallas had been built over a 25-year period. They filed a lawsuit against the to the Supreme Court and helped nationwide. And in 2014, they sued claiming the tax credit program &gt;&gt; Our case was about the fact were only going into low-income in the city of Dallas. And we were looking to get into some higher-opportunity which were predominantly &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: The case is still the challenges to affordable around the country and raises the tax credit program is Thank you. Last November, I went to Chicago of the tax credit industry. It takes a lot of players-- consultants, developers-- to put affordable housing deals Over the past 30 years, build more than 2 1/2 million The program costs about $8 an amount that's been growing. But that hasn't kept up with and that lack of housing makes Stacie Nekus is a vice president or syndicators. &gt;&gt; Well, the affordable housing and so investors really like it. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Why do the &gt;&gt; Well, I think you're giving but you're also able to get &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: How's business &gt;&gt; Very strong. Yeah, demand is off the charts. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: The program is Poor people get good quality and the private sector makes Rick Lazio, a former for the industry. &gt;&gt; People ought not to be but they ought to be to put their capital at risk. And to feel as though they can &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Is this the most &gt;&gt; This is 100% the most It gets the most amount of units You have a lot of different eyes Because again you have the so everyone's looking at it. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: We were looking With so many people struggling we wanted to see how well We analyzed available data given out And here's what we found: the number of units produced has to less than 59,000. But the program is costing in tax credits, that's The estimated rise in for about half of that. We asked representatives about what we found, and reached out to more than 20 and syndicator firms. None would agree But in written responses, that &quot;several factors have such as the loss of other or &quot;soft subsidies,&quot; of trying to help They also claim the business than it used to be. So these are just our numbers. We took our findings the state housing agencies &gt;&gt; I think there are good produced fewer units. And some of those is that we're in areas of opportunity; areas We're also trying to do things So the low-income housing tax a 30-year proven track record that's very well run. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: But not everyone Republican Senator Charles the program. &gt;&gt; My suspicion is that there's with the program. It may not be serving all There may be people in than they should. You would think that this be looking into, because they to see whether the money is it's supposed to serve. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: And are they &gt;&gt; No, they aren't. There's only been seven audits Well, if you aren't following that the low-income housing &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: That's what we were where we found a troubling story This is it. This is nice. I met up with Michael Cox. He spent 15 years as an He showed me one of his prized &gt;&gt; Hey, Mike. How are you? &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: It's a $25 million Half of them for formerly &gt;&gt; You would never know where in this building. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Where did &gt;&gt; Well, like myself, they was &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: of the tightest housing markets and developments like Labre are &gt;&gt; It's approximately two &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: To get &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: It has a community This is a great room! Its own laundry. &gt;&gt; We leave it open 24 hours because of the residents &gt;&gt; Supportive housing actually every year because it costs more using services like And so in the long run it money over the lifetime &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: But there was more Cox had a partner the Carlisle Development Group. Carlisle was founded a leader in Florida's affordable And it was run by his partner's Together Carlisle and became a powerhouse. Between 2006 and 2009, the two more than a quarter billion &gt;&gt; Biscayne Housing went to the number 12 affordable in the country. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Wow. &gt;&gt; And, and Carlisle became the, in the country. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: In the country &gt;&gt; And, it was exciting. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: But the Cox says he suspected Carlisle He discovered documents &gt;&gt; They showed about $6 million that had been kept secret. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: How could they have &gt;&gt; I had no idea. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Carlisle's secret the attention of federal &gt;&gt; This was a Carlisle Lloyd Boggio and Matthew Greer. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Assistant U.S. has spent nearly five years the tax credit industry As Sherwin and his team dug into construction contracts, they &gt;&gt; This is the actual contract. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: This is how it &gt;&gt; Florida Housing wants to know &quot;How much is it going to cost this thing?&quot; They tell Florida Housing, &quot;We've signed this contract and to build.&quot; Now, there's an email between and they negotiated this the day to pay you, contractor, we're telling the state we're &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: One day later. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: So they knew a day that the actual construction &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Carlisle used the more tax credits from the &gt;&gt; It's not a very complicated It's a lie for money. The contract is inflated. So this lie enabled them to get just on this one deal. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: By the time investigators discovered $34 million from 14 projects. What did you think when you saw millions of dollars It was amazing. This is a huge amount of money. And this is all on top of the in legitimate fees and profits. &gt;&gt; This is the apartment... &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: And prosecutors Nearly $2 million had been the apartments for the homeless, and Michael Cox was &gt;&gt; They were extorting me, saying we will kill these to this kickback scheme. &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, this is where Michael Cox does not go Michael Cox does not go Michael Cox says nothing &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: You spent the next And a lot of people are going Why did you take it? &gt;&gt; I convinced myself that this amazing projects I went from fighting monsters &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: I tried to reach in these developments. Hi, Mr. Boggio... But none would talk. I wanted to ask them about where Some of it was tracked back to One was called Caesar &gt;&gt; Caesar and Cleopatra, those Over $12 million flowed through &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Through that after his dogs. &gt;&gt; Correct. Correct. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Other kickbacks came through a cut-out called &gt;&gt; This is a fake construction they set up SSHH Construction. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: It's literally SSHH like &quot;be quiet&quot; construction. &gt;&gt; It was just used to hide And prosecutors traced some to Boggio's house. &gt;&gt; I believe his house is valued his mansion in Coconut Grove. He liked to live a good &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Ultimately, Boggio, to crimes related to the A scheme that had gone unnoticed for years. &gt;&gt; These housing agencies don't They don't have a lot Looking at Florida Housing, with a limited staff that is hundreds of millions of dollars local and federal money. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: So the IRS is on the housing authorities and corruption. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: In Tallahassee, running the agency that oversees in Florida. What was your reaction when about this investigation? &gt;&gt; Um, certainly disappointment would do that with programs to serve folks in need. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: The prosecutor in the case described the agency when it came to developers with and lots of resources. Do you think that's accurate? &gt;&gt; Outmatched. Most of the folks that we deal that do good work, you know. Presumably that's similar That's why you've got few and relatively few scandalous &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: I'm trying to so few scandalous incidents or because they're so difficult &gt;&gt; There's a lot of financial you know, for playing that game. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: So you feel like or a bad apple? &gt;&gt; Yes. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Some of the say that this was this was an aberration. Do you think that's true? &gt;&gt; No, I don't think it's true. We'll see what the future holds, to be looked at and there's a to be held accountable for and what's to come, &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Soon, the head we interviewed would resign And as we kept looking into we heard about allegations involving another major &gt;&gt; My name is David Deutch of Pinnacle Housing Group. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: We discovered was owned by the principals &gt;&gt; And bring something new &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: A source in the that DAXC was being used from Pinnacle projects. So one of the other ones that is this DAXC Company, which is, as another really large down here in Florida. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: We've been told, a company that didn't actually &gt;&gt; I can't comment on this, Maybe later, but not now. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Because you know &gt;&gt; I can't say I know it, if I don't say anything &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Turns out, Sherwin and DAXC. Three months after our with stealing federal tax The company signed an admitting it inflated costs on four projects. It returned the money Under the deal the charges if the company continues to But we still had questions It's definitely the name I'm just wondering if it's in Costa Rica? That's the rumor. The leadership in the company And that's what took our to see what Pinnacle <i> Hola.</i> <i> Como estas?</i> <i> Buscando Daxc Jimenez.</i> Later that night, just outside we found Daxc at a beachside <i> Gracias.</i> &gt;&gt; Yes, I am Daxc. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN:<i> Hola. &gt;&gt; Laura, nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Daxc said he wasn't he said he was just a guide and that they named the shell They named a company after you. &gt;&gt; Yes. They told me that. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: They told you? &gt;&gt; They told me but, &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: You didn't? &gt;&gt; No, I didn't. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: He said he had no Let me show you what happened. But he did know the partners had for years. One of the principal managers... &gt;&gt; Principal managers, right. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: They have a Costa Rican company That company turned out to be in the secluded area At the top of the resort, It's their multi-million dollar where they take vacations. And, we learned, have taken Last week, Florida's housing to ban Pinnacle from affordable saying the company had used Pinnacle declined our request it would contest the ban and said it did not violate Three developers in Florida were from the program. How can the housing finance that that's not happening in their states? &gt;&gt; We really encourage our in the community, people who are to really come to us if they see are not right with a project. We just encourage people that say something. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Okay. &gt;&gt; The other things that we do-- we have architects who get when the cost certifications are to check the reasonableness &gt;&gt; There's not a lot of to the housing agencies other than basic The application, contracts, So, it's really a program &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Did you just call a &quot;program of trust&quot;? &gt;&gt; Yes. It is a program of trust. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: The U.S. a program of trust. Do you think that's true? &gt;&gt; This is a program where and investors work together. And certainly, there is in any development project. I think the vast majority of pretty well. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: The tax credit that it supports and doesn't tolerate fraud &gt;&gt; The developments are There's no need to extract It's like killing That's what they're doing. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: How widespread do &gt;&gt; Look, I don't have the that this fraud doesn't just There's too much money involved based upon information this fraud exists &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Sherwin says he's other national developers, as Last December, the Carlisle Lloyd Boggio received nearly Matt Greer three years Michael Cox had to repay the and received probation with the homeless and &gt;&gt; When costs are inflated, the number of housing units and we are building less &gt;&gt; I get it. I'm not against you making a case against capitalism But this is money that was going in Florida. And it didn't. The money that they took could of additional extra units, Look, there's a housing crisis &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: And you were on the street because that belonged to them. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. We ended up really, really and betraying their trust. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: After digging this much is clear: there are why it's producing less and costing more. But, without strong oversight of the billions flowing through it's hard to know exactly where &gt;&gt; You've got a bunch of people in between. Nobody's saying they shouldn't but are they doing it in to provide the best housing That's what we as policy makers out of the Government Should this program be continued or to what extent &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: We wanted to ask at the Treasury Department about They wouldn't agree And officials at the Department of Housing which runs the Section 8 voucher &gt;&gt; Hi. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: We returned Can you spend five minutes It had been three months since who had just received Section 8 They're talking Farryn Giles had started &gt;&gt; Hearing talks about &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: And had hoped near work. But she wasn't having any luck &gt;&gt; I've been to Oakcliff, I've been to Pleasant Grove. I've been way down south. Nobody wants my voucher. &gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: In January, Farryn to use the voucher but she did find a place We've been following who've really struggled Why are they having &gt;&gt; Well, this is a good example of why the affordability are a crisis. There is some discrimination these vouchers. We need to figure out ways to when they have a voucher, can be But vouchers aren't We need a housing policy more affordable housing.
