&quot;Be your own bank.&quot; That used to be the slogan for one of the I remember when I first heard that slogan, and In hindsight, [it was] ridiculous in so many ways. It represents the aspiration, the sheer audacity, of wanting to replace institutions that I like that, the sheer audacity of it. I like the idea. Like the old UNIX t-shirt that said, [Laughter] But that audacity, that vision, I have worked in security for It was one of the first things I fell in love with As part of [my career], I've worked with a I've done a lot of work around datacenters, firewalls, When I hear &quot;be your own bank,&quot; it appeals to me, I understand what that means, what it involves. Of course, that's a bit of a problem: [Most people think], 'Why would I want to be a bank, 'It sounds complicated.' It is complicated. At the same time, there is a reason why we Banks, as institutions, represent a centralization [They form] some of the most powerful Funny how we never use the word 'cartel' There's the oil cartel, the drug cartel, but nobody Yet it's the biggest damn cartel out there! It means to have exorbitant monopoly power that you and stifle [dissent]. Banking as an institution was something In the 16th century, the only person who Now, the person writing a check is the octogenarian causing twenty people behind him to groan audibly. The United States is one of the few countries If you try to explain that concept in Europe, A great liberating institution, at first. Gradually, creates monopoly conditions, shuts down competition, and then becomes the very thing it disrupted. They are the new kings. They are the new royalty. So it is important to start with that audacity, with open protocols, with open systems. But don't ask users to be their own banks, We're facing this really difficult conundrum with How do we want open blockchains I don't know what the specific applications People ask me, &quot;Will Bitcoin find its killer app?&quot; Money that is neutral, open, borderless, censorship- That is the killer app. You don't need another killer app. What you need is, to make that killer app They're not in this room. We [in this room] don't need because of the banking cartel, a very tenuous The fact that you prefer to make most of your purchases does not immediately in your minds translate to In countries where they are playing the end stage of and has collapsed as a system of technology. They need this, so how do we take this With &quot;be your own bank,&quot; that A fundamental premise of this system is It is about not using intermediaries. You get to not just own an account, but be a banker; Not because you want to be a banker, but because If you can use that app, you are a banker, just like That was unthinkable a hundred years ago. we will be able to use a banking app in such a way Or at least not in the form we have today. We will use these open protocols; between now and These fundamental problems have to do with security. There are two different sides to the security industry: [When you] go to these conferences, you will hear how people might one day reverse We talk about vulnerabilities in hardware wallets, the challenges of operating system security, and What does that mean to the average cryptocurrency It's a foreign language. It's completely irrelevant. If you [listen to] these talks, you might think that the happens because of some mad scientist's lab, to break 128-bit [encryption] and [to Usually, it is [because there is] someone running one of which is a trojan, and then decides Or someone putting their money on a a Google search they did yesterday. Of course it offered them &quot;great trading opportunities&quot; [Laughter] Then one day, it's not there anymore. The vast majority of loss in this industry Phishing of your SIM card. Why would an attacker try when they can hack [or pay off] a minimum wage If you are even using SMS two-factor authentication, you are already on the cutting edge of OPSEC! &quot;'Two factors? That is a whole other factor on top of [Laughter] You are cruising out there in OPSEC and you have no idea what you did wrong. What could you do better? For the average One of my hobbies is [flying]. I pilot small planes. One of the things I love is reading about accidents, You have to know what [causes dead] pilots I read all of these obscure reports about failures The majority of [accidents] are [caused by]: decision fatigue, lack of situational Here is what happens if you put a stack of they will decide not to fly; instead they will rent a car Forget the fact that driving is approximately Forget the fact that [over] a hundred thousand people [Deciding not to fly because of accident 'I understand how to drive a car. I have no idea how 'I don't understand any of the risk factors, [but after] 'I will jump into my Camry and drive to New Jersey.' Even that sense of control, 'I'm in control. I'm behind two drunks, a sleepy truck driver, and dead animals That fundamental risk miscalculation kills people. The death rate on roads in the U.S. quadrupled in the I got on a plane the week after. [People] are doing [the equivalent of] People read about an obscure vulnerability say, &quot;Well, that's it! I'm not using any of &quot;A BIP-38 paper wallet that I load on a Raspberry Pi. &quot;Step one: download a secure operating system. &quot;... How the hell would I do that? &quot;I have no idea how to securely verify what I Not knowing how to use it is like driving from Pensacola This is the exact kind of risk calculation that happens. The greatest enemy to security, on the front-ends It's not the obscure vulnerabilities in a system or the It will be forgetting the complex password that It will be you installing a wallet to take control of to Dropbox -- because why wouldn't you? That seems We laugh at this, but security experts will Idiots don't know what they don't know. If you read on the internet, 'Dunning-Kruger effect' not knowing the extent of their own ignorance. If you actually read the study, you [realise] that we I know security and I'm fairly confident about that; because there are no mirrors for me to That is the Dunning-Kruger effect in action. I don't know We all have domains in which Our ignorance of what we don't know makes us cocky, we don't have enough knowledge to evaluate the risks. We all suffer from Dunning-Kruger. In security, it [will] cost you your funds. Then you make poor [risk management] choices. Let me give you a classic example that I have People create a mnemonic seed and are so worried steal their seed in the middle of that they [ignore] the prescribed solution Instead, they improvise. They take the twelve and store the pieces in four different locations. They feel secure, except they have just taken If you think 64 bits is one quarter of the [strength] It is not [one quarter of the strength], it's 10 ^ 50? Less secure than if you had to crack the whole thing. If I managed to get three of those pieces, In fact, the 64 bits of that last piece I need to that you could have put on [if you There's also no password stretching, But that's not the real problem. The real problem isn't that you thought cutting it in four pieces The problem is, you created a solution that isn't resilient. reconstructed in perfect order, If you lose a word on one of those pieces, you're in If you lose one [whole] piece, good luck finding If you lose two [pieces], you're done. You don't realise the risk you have actually exposed a risk you weren't facing, the mystical cat burglar and comes to steal your seed. You can solve that problem a hell of a The average user is not good at doing that risk and which risks don't, [Most of them] don't make sure that their elaborate If something happens to them, [those heirs] Your crypto [may go] to the moon, but your chances can be rudely interrupted by a bus. Then what? Your relatives try to decipher scheme you devised in order to protect your funds? Even if you don't [do that] and all they have the greatest crypto-expert they knew just died. You were the expert. They will go on Reddit [Bad] people will line up to defraud them. Security in this space is complex. It's very difficult to Worse, the user interfaces are so complex. A user interface needs to be intuitive; meaning that you better make sure the If we design interfaces where the obvious thing is also If you leave them hanging and they have to figure This isn't just a problem of 'how do I be The vast majority of people faced They [find] a custodial service and put all of their A custodial service that has far [fewer] standards very few or no controls. There are some &quot;good&quot; ones now, The saying goes, there are two types of exchanges: There is no unhackable exchange. If you [then you know] there is no more difficult task today than that can be transmitted irreversibly This is a hugely difficult problem. You need no one within your exchange can steal it, How to balance resilience and security, access for If a bank has its money [unintentionally] transferred out If a cryptocurrency exchange gets hacked, Digital assets are very difficult to hold. The only [way] If thousands, then hundreds of thousands, that is [more] secure because [a thief would have] If you instead take these keys and concentrate that institution -- by simple math -- has to be a million because they have a much bigger pot of money, Here's the problem we have: there is no &quot;million You can't do that effectively when you concentrate It doesn't decrease a bit, it decreases by orders The real problem is, what the hell is the point if people in custodial wallets and exchanges? What the hell are we doing this for? A lot of [these custodial service] people will smile &quot;We will give them ease-of-use and peace of mind.&quot; What they [mean] is, &quot;We hear your anarchist but rather than doing that, how about Same business as usual; &quot;The banking cartel sucks, but my new banking cartel [Laughter] That doesn't change anything. We are doing this because decentralisation matters, that our society needs in order to scale We understand that decentralization is the only thing without descending into some kind [Either that] or we didn't really believe in any of it, and replacing the old rich people in charge. We have to solve these security problems. For our users, &quot;Be your own bank&quot; without understanding on immature user interfaces with underdeveloped I love that. I'm a geek. I want to take all of the but that is not what everybody else [will] do [or feel]. [Right now], it is either that choice or &quot;I can't do this, and we're back to business as usual. We must solve this problem. We must provide user interfaces and allow people to manage their own money, to empower In order to do that, we [must] understand that users Their password is 'password1234,' They [probably] don't care to learn any of that. They will make one stupid mistake, like typing their password into some weird pop-up and that is all it takes. You read about these people [all the time] who say, &quot;I just &quot;So I invested.&quot; You didn't &quot;invest,&quot; you threw your money We have to make security more intuitive for users We all have the Dunning-Kruger effect, It is our responsibility to help users understand which vulnerabilities are important, Eventually, gradually. Make the complexity disappear into the background, From the beginning. Thank you! [Applause]
