<i> (&quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot;)</i> I've wanted to get over for a very, very long time. This seemed like such a good idea Like... actually being here... actually being at Alton Towers... That was a problem for future me, and this sucks. To be clear, I am irrationally afraid of this. And if you're thinking, &quot;Oh, he's done It's the rollercoaster. It's the click-click-click up the hill. It's the being strapped in. The team here are giving me backstage access. For the infrastructure nerd in me, I'm gonna get to see how it all works. <i>(laughs)</i> And I really appreciate it. I love that I'm gonna get to see this. But... it's not gonna help. This is gonna suck...! No, it's not. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. I just need to breathe through it. <i>(music swells)</i> <i>(crowd screaming)</i> <i>(nervous chatter)</i> <i>(crowd shrieks)</i> <i></i> Good morning, Tom. How are you? Nervous, but I think less nervous Like, Runaway Mine Train is... Yeah, all ages, mate. <i>(exhales shakily)</i> <i>(both chuckling)</i> So Tom, the first thing we do, mate... we isolate the electricity Just so we can make it Yeah. This is a powered ride, right? There's no freefall drop. It's-- It's fine. It's like... You're not even You've got a lap bar, but you're not full-on. You're not strapped in from the shoulders. And then what we do is We check that previously, Yeah. Yeah. So everyone signs in, signs out. Anything even minor Safe as houses, mate. <i>(laughs)</i> There's no drops here. This is a powered coaster. Alright, Jordan. <i>(sighs)</i> This is fine. It's fine. It doesn't do a freefall drop. It's just-- This is a rollercoaster. This is just a normal powered coaster. <i>(inhales sharply)</i> Let's do it. Let's do it. This is a kids' thing. It's a-- That's locked in place now. It's a kids' ride. It's fine. It's not gonna do anything dramatic. You're gonna be okay. <i>Please secure any loose items,</i> <i>keeping your arms and legs <i>Sit back, hold on tight,</i> <i>and enjoy the ride. Choo-choo.</i> <i>(laughs)</i> I feel like Oh, here we go, okay. Yeah, this is fine. It's fine. It's fine. I can do this. A-yup. Yep. Now, how's this drop? Yes, this is fine. Okay, as long as... What happens if I try and panic? Whoa, okay. Heh. I can control the panic feeling. Breathe through it, and you're fine. This is absolutely fine. This is... ...you're fine. This is okay. This is, unfortunately... ...what I would call my limit. That little run through there... ...that's about all I want to do. And that's not <i> (uplifting adventure music)</i> So I've got good news and bad news. The good news is, I am absolutely That's fine. Thank you very much. The bad news is... that... ...that feels like it's my limit. That feels like that's about as much And I know we're not gonna stop there. <i> (hollow atmospheric music)</i> Oh, that is steep. <i>(sighs)</i> <i>(crow cawing)</i> You can shut up. <i>(chuckles weakly)</i> <i>(exhales, groans)</i> I'm aware that this is Like, closed theme park, I'm aware how lucky I am. They're doing maintenance and testing. Every time there's a little &quot;pssht&quot; noise, <i>(music intensifies)</i> my heart jumps a bit. That is so much bigger... and it drops so much more steeply. <i>(music climaxes, ends)</i> Franklin. Hello. Welcome to Wicker Man. That's really big. That's a lot... Runaway Mine Train... <i>(stammers)</i> I don't have words! I don't have words. You'll be fine. Come with me. <i>(half-hearted laugh)</i> So, this is the track. What we're gonna do this morning, all of the sensors I saw the team out there, Yeah, so we'll go there, We are? Oh! Okay, this I love. This does not involve Yeah okay, let's go. So see, we're making sure So, is that sensor Yeah, that flags the train, to know where the train is. It just checks there's one It feels so wrong to be walking On the way up, On the way down, Yep. You're carefully inspecting. I'm just inspecting the cable, You need to check every link, Yeah. Everything's fine up to there. So... long chain up... into a sorta steady, slow drop here? I was expecting this but this is-- I might be okay with this? You'll be fine, yeah, no problem. You have more confidence So you've checked the lift hill. Team's checked the rest of the track. We're good to go. Everything's fine. We're going to leave just for a minute, I just saved more than EUR500 I'm in France as I record this. and it seemed really expensive, So on a hunch, I clicked that made it look like I was still in the UK, The price was suddenly less than half: Same company, same type of car, I went all the way to the The only difference was that and for some reason, I haven't done a comprehensive that NordVPN could've let me Maybe there was an even There are other uses for VPNs, like accessing content or hiding the names of the sites you're visiting NordVPN had a whole list of talking points encrypted cloud storage, and threat protection But I have just thrown those out that using NordVPN more than six times the cost I can't guarantee it'll always be that good, then NordVPN have a 30-day If you head to or click the link in the description, Right, I think when we left off, I was having a very stressful morning. <i> (horror-themed music)</i> Full fear has just kicked in. Like... pit-of-the-stomach dread. Are you okay, Tom? Do you want me Are you sure? I can come on with you That's not helpful. I've done so much more I've done-- This is This is so much less than I'm just... just... I don't wanna do this. Do you want me to come on? Don't ask. Don't. <i>(roars)</i> Do it. Do it. <i>(growls)</i> <i>(groans)</i> 'Kay, 'kay, 'kay. No, you're calm, you're calm, you're calm, you're calm. <i>(track clicking)</i> No. <i>(shouts angrily)</i> No. You're not calm. You're gonna yell, you're gonna shout. 'Cause there's no way you're gonna <i>(yells angrily)</i> I can't feel my hands. I can't feel my hands. I can't feel my hands. Argh... come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Here we go! <i>(grunts)</i> <i>(growls)</i> <i>(roars)</i> Waaah! Waa-haa! This is fine. Gaaaaaah! This is fine, this is fine. <i>(squeals)</i> I can do this. ...I can do this.

Have it! <i>(groans)</i> <i>(sighs)</i> Yus! <i>(grunts)</i> <i> (music on speakers)</i> <i>(wheezes exhaustedly)</i> I can't-- I can't feel my hands. <i>Please exit to your left. Anyone who's scared of rollercoasters, Anyone-- Like, if you hate of going over a hill, something like that... That's fear. I thought it was a physical thing. I thought it was your stomach, It's not. It's just fear. 'Cause I went over the first hill, and I felt that, and I was like, and then it wasn't there. And then that was one of Can we... Can we do that again? <i> (dramatic music)</i> My heart rate just spiked, just looking at the sign and <i>(sighs into groaning)</i> I don't wanna do this, I don't wanna do this, <i>(inhales sharply)</i> I blatantly do want to do this, but... <i>(sighs)</i> <i>(distant coaster rolling)</i> That's so much more! That is so much more, Mmmph! Gonna be honest, Even after Wicker Man, Ohhh, I don't like that. I am extremely lucky to be standing here out-of-hours. And I hate it. <i>(wheezes)</i> Oh! Oh, I just saw that! <i>(laughs uproariously)</i> You must be Andy. Welcome to Nemesis. We've done the ride checks. Checked it's all safe for you. It's not designed to be friendly. Yeah, that's part of the thing, It's part of the experience, you know. It's 700 metres long, 250 tons of steel. Don't wanna frighten you any more, This is the leg-dangly one, right? Left, right, up, down. <i>(growls)</i> You can stop laughing <i>(machinery whirring)</i> Just gonna take you through This is the Nemesis &quot;pod&quot;, We have to undo the pod, lift it up, Oh wow! What we're doing in here, we're checking So it moves freely, as it should. That's got a lot more movement So what it is, in the garage, Oh, okay! So we can actually check these things, When you're out on the track, So everything's tighter and So everything here Yeah, everything. Everywhere on park. Everything you're looking at Right. Then obviously, weekly, monthly, So yeah, that's me done. <i>(rasps)</i> Okay. <i>(track clicks on)</i> <i>(sighs)</i> I was really into this. I was really into-- You've gotta get on it now. Yeah, then I realised <i>(hydraulic brake hisses)</i> That noise! So this whole track is This whole track's gonna go. <i>(locking pins clicking)</i> Wow! <i>(piston hisses, lock clicks)</i> Wow. when the track comes over, And we have to have that I mean, it's like five millimetres. Oh, of course it does! That's one thing you gotta think about. <i>(door creaking open)</i> One step closer to you riding. Oh, that control panel! Ancient, isn't it? Right, shall we bring it in? So these two buttons here. Oh, so it's two buttons. No. And it's a two-person operation. a maintenance key for engineers, But the ride stuff, when they're sending it, Right, so one person here, and one person-- Okay, shall we bring it in? <i>(mechanical grinding, hissing)</i> <i>(train clattering)</i> It's the noise! It's always the noise! It's a pretty iconic noise, isn't it? Yeah... <i>(exhales slowly)</i> <i>(mouths &quot;No&quot;)</i> But I never will be, so yeah.
