I guess the main problem now is the decrease And that comes Oh. Absolutely. Since 2008 we've started It has decreased because been put into it, but we've in the past century. So what is Rhino 911 Well, we've found that is available to us today Every year, more are illegally The rhinos are killed are very valuable in some can fetch up to of dollars on the black market. While they can't protect they can make some killed by poachers. And they do that by trimming in a safe way. It's dangerous work, to help keep these going extinct. Sad reality that that's But I think at this point, it's and doing what's Unfortunately, that's the only you know. And for our children that is absolutely critical.
