&gt;&gt; &quot;The Angel Gabriel to a city of Galilee &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Every Sunday, people gather to hear a story. &gt;&gt; &quot;...and the virgin's name &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: For more than 2,000 that story has been told &gt;&gt; &quot;...and to bear a son.&quot; &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Along the way, each generation has found its own meaning &gt;&gt; &quot;'...you shall call his name &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: That story, of a man who became Jesus Christ, was originally told &gt;&gt; &quot;'...and be called the Son &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And then retold by later believers &gt;&gt; &quot;The Gospel according &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: So began In the first two parts, with the we tried to reconstruct and how, after his death, a small Jewish sect began Tonight, and how a faith overcame &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Jewish resistance after the sack of Jerusalem. Rebel fighters held out The Jewish historian Josephus, recounted the story: &gt;&gt; There was a fortress not far from Jerusalem, which had been built It is called Masada. &gt;&gt; The rock of Masada, one of the most glorious places became the major refuge point for some of the most extremist The Zealots and their most fled right in the middle to Masada. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Here had been amply sufficient to last an abundance of wine and oil. There was also found a mass hoarded up by the king &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: From the heights the defenders could see surrounding them. The outlines of their camps are still visible from the air. &gt;&gt; If you were a Roman soldier I think your heart would sink, because you know to, first, to spend building a lot of ramps, to move the army up the sides But you would know that you were because all the while, the fortifiers and guardians would have been pelting you with at, no doubt, great losses &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Josephus described &gt;&gt; (dramatized): The Romans to make an assault which they did. But they saw nobody but a terrible solitude as well as a perfect silence. &gt;&gt; The irony, of course, is that when the soldiers breached it was not they who had been it was those who had committed suicide. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: According the defenders rather than submit But modern archaeologists have of mass suicide among the ruins. What really happened there But Josephus' version turned Masada of a noble failure. &gt;&gt; The failure of the first really was a traumatic event for everyone living Jews and Christians alike. As a result, they had some of their own assumptions. When Jerusalem was destroyed, a whole new series of questions &quot;What do we do &quot;Where is the source &quot;What does God want us to do?&quot; &gt;&gt; This era was an age not just for Christianity, It marks the emergence, into the light of history of a new group and a new literature and a new way &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Without the temple, the priesthood that had presided There emerged new leaders, rabbis who would lead in a new direction. &gt;&gt; And the rabbis represent a new age of definition. It is the rabbis who now emerge and it is this Judaism from the second century down to our own age. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The failure also created a crisis who were still a part The kingdom had not come; The followers of Jesus coped about the man would deliver the new kingdom &gt;&gt; We have to remember For 40 years, there's no written until after the revolt. During that time, we have very little in the way within Christianity. Our first writer and his first letter is dated so still a good 20 years But it appears that in between and the writing that they clearly are They're passing on the tradition what he stood for orally, by telling it &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Meeting early Christians told stories of Jesus' parables and miracles, and of his suffering and death. These were not historical but shared memories &gt;&gt; Legend and myth and hymn and are the vehicles in which One could, for example, imagine that the oldest way in which about Jesus' suffering was the hymn that Paul quotes &gt;&gt; (dramatized): And being found he humbled himself to the point of death, &gt;&gt; Paul quotes this hymn of the first century. He quotes this as a hymn in the Christian communities That is the way in which you and that you tell the story also shows that the telling is anchored in the worship life So here is really the beginning &gt;&gt; It seems that, over time, some of these stories came to be or what came to be thought of the good news, &gt;&gt; (dramatized): The beginning of Jesus Christ, the son of God, as it is written Prepare the way of the Lord. Make his path straight. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The Gospel of Mark is the oldest It was written soon after for a community to reconcile its expectations with the loss of the temple. &gt;&gt; We know a little bit from some things Mark's audience reads Greek, Mark always has to explain the &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Taking her <i> &quot;Talitha cumi,&quot;</i> which means, &quot;I say to you, arise.&quot; &gt;&gt; Mark is written for living somewhere and thus reflecting on the from that vantage point. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Mark's audience parading through the streets, bearing plunder They would certainly have seen, the coins that depicted &gt;&gt; Mark is clearly reflecting as part of his understanding of the life and death of Jesus. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In Mark's story, Jesus predicts that the temple because it has been desecrated. &gt;&gt; Jesus is standing against And Mark wants us to understand to why he must die and why &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Do you see Not one stone will be left here All will be thrown down! &gt;&gt; The Gospel of Mark is the story, if you read it apart It's a story of this country with incredible power descending healing people, speaking strange, bold, and startling everyone. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): He said Have you no faith?&quot; And they were filled with awe, &quot;Who is this, then, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Mark was the first to write the story of the life He took disparate elements and a few early written sources and wove them together &gt;&gt; Mark seems to have and maybe two or three different The fact that Mark takes of Jesus miracle stories suggests that, in fact, of understanding Jesus is as a miracle worker. But miracle workers are a dime We hear about all sorts of so that doesn't really seem &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In Mark, is that he is a peculiar kind In one case, he has to attempt to get it right, and at another time, he can't &gt;&gt; It seems to be one of the &quot;He's not just a miracle worker, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Jesus emerges as a strange and somewhat &gt;&gt; Jesus is mysterious. Jesus intentionally keeps people who he really is at times. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): He said &quot;For those outside, &quot;in order that they may, indeed, and may, indeed, listen &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The Jesus both reveals and conceals a paradox scholars call &gt;&gt; It seems to me is indeed that cannot be recognized and that the messianic secret is that he is the son of man and not the messiah who is And that that will become clear only at the very end The suffering and death of Jesus &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Since Mark's community has come to see in a new light. Mark is challenging as an apocalyptic figure. &gt;&gt; Mark, coming out of the first great war after the destruction Mark sees Jesus, that Mark knew all about as God's persecuted one-- It's a very unromantic Jesus. It's a terrifying image, because that's &gt;&gt; (dramatized): darkness came until 3:00 in the afternoon. At 3:00, Jesus cried out &quot;My God, my God, &gt;&gt; Mark tells us that Jesus died And I think Mark is writing for the experience of people who are dying like that, that Jesus had died that way feeling abandoned by God. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In Mark's Jesus dies and his body When the tomb is discovered, &gt;&gt; Mark ends with an empty tomb and a waiting for the return He ends, almost, with an absent because that's what has experienced in persecution, an absent Jesus. Now, nobody after Mark is going Matthew will change it. Luke will change it. John will change it. The scribes will even change to put other endings there. Mark creates the empty tomb, as his way &gt;&gt; And the last words &quot;And they were terrified.&quot; It would be very bad news if it weren't that underneath is an enormous hope that this very unpromising and its terrible, is, nevertheless, that there's a mystery in it, a divine mystery that will happen yet. And I think it's that sense of &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Mark began with his dramatic story The later gospel writers by drawing on the story &gt;&gt; Matthew and Luke both sort of the basic storyline because Mark is completely into both Matthew and Luke. &gt;&gt; Matthew and Luke which is why Matthew, Mark, and Luke-- are called because they can be &gt;&gt; Once scholars had decided that Mark's gospel was used it was possible to compare them and to realize with a common sequence that wasn't in Mark. &gt;&gt; Scholars observed that there's a part that are exactly identical In fact, they're identical Now, think: Jesus spoke Aramaic. So if you were translating and if I were translating they'd come out different, So you would only have You would only have Jesus speaking identical sayings if you had a written translation And so scholars suggested besides Mark, something else that would have been a list translated into Greek. And they called that quelle, and they call it, Nobody ever has found We can reconstruct it because we guess that &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: &quot;Q&quot; was composed It would have presented Jesus the very image of the messiah that Mark felt compelled &gt;&gt; (dramatized): There will be when you see Abraham, Isaac, and all the prophets and you yourself thrown out. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But this is also who sometimes speaks words &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Consider They neither toil nor spin, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: &quot;Q&quot; does not tell of the life and death of Jesus. It contains only his sayings, so it reveals a different way &gt;&gt; Whoever collected wasn't interested wasn't interested thought the importance of Jesus was what he said, Now, other people thought, to have the sayings of Jesus. You have to tell about his... and his crucifixion, That's the important thing. Now, somebody put that and we call it Matthew, &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Blessed for yours is the Kingdom of God. Blessed are you that hunger now, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: &quot;Q&quot; was probably in the Jewish homeland Scholars do not agree of Mark, Matthew, Luke, or John. They were separated not only Writing decades apart, for tiny communities that were developing independently of each other. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Blessed for theirs is the kingdom Blessed are the meek, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: About 15 years Matthew wrote his gospel caught up in the transformation after the fall of the temple. &gt;&gt; Matthew's gospel is clearly for a Jewish-Christian audience living within of the homeland itself. Matthew's is the most Jewish &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Matthew's community in the upper Galilee, After the war, many who had been moved north and settled New leadership was evolving here the rabbis who gave fresh to the ancient Jewish Matthew's community felt &gt;&gt; The followers of Jesus very much on the fringe Obviously, the early preachers that they would convert the But they were bitterly that only a very few accepted And they remained very much on the fringe &gt;&gt; (dramatized): The Gospel with the position of these early within Israel. And it's very important is fully a man from Israel. Therefore, Matthew begins his all the genealogy of Jesus and now traces this back For Matthew, Jesus is a son That is, he is truly a man &gt;&gt; The way Matthew then tells draws on a lot of symbols Jesus goes up onto a mountain and there talks about the law. He looks like Moses. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): When Jesus he went up to the mountain and taught them, saying, &quot;You are the light &gt;&gt; Jesus delivers five different just like the five books &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Think not to abolish the law I have come not to abolish, &gt;&gt; In Matthew, Jesus is just like the Pharisees. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Whoever will be called least For I tell you, exceeds that of the scribes you will never enter &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The Jesus singles out the Pharisees &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Woe to you, hypocrites. For you are which on the outside but inside, they are full and all kinds of filth. &gt;&gt; Now, in Jesus' own times, the Pharisees weren't Why does Matthew tell the story so that a group during Jesus' own lifetime now becomes the main opponent? It's precisely in the life after the war. The Pharisees are becoming their and we're watching Matthew's Christian-Jewish group in tension over what would be &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In Matthew, between two Jewish groups. Tensions created by this debate and lead to the split &gt;&gt; Most of the gospels reflect of theological disagreement. And the new narrative history that evolves in the form of, tells a story of a broken and that's part of the sad story that evolves because it is a story that in later times. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: By the time the trauma of the war Now his followers for the hearts and minds over the future direction This may be one of the reasons Matthew's account of the death is so different from Mark's. &gt;&gt; Matthew was saying &quot;I have to conclude I'm talking about something that but I have to bring my gospel up Now, what's the last climactic Where do I locate it and what Matthew is reading Mark. There's a massive consensus He finds that Mark ends with the women fleeing Is that the way No. He has Jesus meet the women. And now the women, then, because Jesus sort of corrects And the last scene in Matthew, who meets the disciples where the story began, and they're told to go out &gt;&gt; The gospels are very peculiar They're not biographies. I mean, there are all sorts that they simply are not They are a kind What they do is proclaim their individual author's of the Christian message through the device as a spokesperson &gt;&gt; For somebody who thinks are like four witnesses trying to tell exactly how as it were, this is extremely troubling. It is not at all troubling because they told me, that they were gospels. And a gospel is good news-- updated interpretation, so I did not expect journalism. &gt;&gt; There are several different enshrined in the shape and that these seem to go back &gt;&gt; The major issue, for me, is whether the people the stories in the ancient world took them all literally, and now we're so smart that we know to take them or they all intended them and we're so dumb that we've And I really am I think we have been because the people don't seem the least bit worried We see the problem, and then we want to insist I think we have misread not they have miswritten them. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Since many to set down the events that have I, too, decided, after investigating everything to write an orderly account. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Luke's gospel takes one step further, because Luke was almost writing for a mainly And the story he has to tell reached the rest of the world. &gt;&gt; The Jesus of Luke is I mean, he comes on the scene as a prophet straight out I mean, at his first appearance he quotes the Prophet Isaiah. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): The spirit He has sent me to proclaim and recovery of sight to let the oppressed go free. &gt;&gt; Jesus goes He takes the scroll of Isaiah. He is literate-- of course he He can find his way around and find exactly the place and reads it and comments on it. Jesus is a scholar. Jesus is rather like Luke, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Tradition claims was a traveling companion of the and probably lived where Paul founded Luke wrote a story about Jesus, but he also wrote the story of the growth and its spread &gt;&gt; It's very important that the Gospel of Luke is only one-half And we make a mistake just as the story of Jesus. What Luke wrote was a story and ends with the arrival &gt;&gt; So the author of Luke/Acts-- and that's what we call them is telling us a bigger story, &gt;&gt; In fact, that many scholars to the novelistic literature and have interpreted Luke/Acts as, really, a Christian, with all the ingredients down to shipwrecks and exotic vegetation, all kinds of embellishments in the romance literature &gt;&gt; (dramatized): We were so violently that, on the next day, they began to throw the cargo And on the third day, they threw the ship's tackle When neither sun nor stars and no small tempest raged, all hope of our being saved &gt;&gt; The style of Luke's gospel is probably the highest of anything So it's very different which has a much cruder quality So anyone from the literary who might have picked up would have felt It's much more like reading &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Tradition holds He clearly possessed And his composition addresses faced by Christian communities &gt;&gt; One of the major concerns that the composite work is whether Christians of the Roman Empire. After all, their founder as a political criminal, and some people would have as revolutionaries. Luke, in his portrait, wants that Jesus himself taught that was entirely compatible with good citizenship and that, despite the fact all of that was and had nothing to do that was in any way dangerous. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In fact, in Luke's the Book of Acts, Paul is treated kindly &gt;&gt; The death of Paul It ends on a triumphant note, preaching freely the Gospel, &gt;&gt; The counterpart that Luke is telling the story with a kind of political agenda is what happens of the Jewish tradition. Luke is much more antagonistic &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: When Luke describes he shows the Jews &gt;&gt; (dramatized): went into the Jewish synagogue, but the unbelieving Jews and poisoned their minds &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Luke/Acts we see the followers of Jesus &gt;&gt; This ethnic that's being reflected is beginning to say the ones who are telling are no longer Luke is reflecting the development more away from the Jewish roots and, in fact, developing more toward the Roman political &gt;&gt; As you read the story you get the impression that from Jerusalem to Rome. That's where the story ends, You wouldn't know, for example, that there was You wouldn't know Everything would be And that's the story When the Gospel gets to Rome, that's the end of the story. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): In the and the Word was with God. And the Word was God, and the Word became flesh &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The now contained is the Gospel of John, written about 70 years It is the story of a community where the relationship has become more virulent, almost to the point &gt;&gt; (dramatized): I am He who follows me but will have the light of life. &gt;&gt; In the fourth gospel, Jesus is a very serene figure who can speak at length A very different kind of speech from the speech which we hear which is usually much more directed, In John, it's reflective &gt;&gt; John's gospel is different from the other three That fact has been recognized Already, by the year 200, was called precisely because it told in symbolic ways from the other three. &gt;&gt; Let me compare Mark with John to explain how two gospels In... we call it Now, there is no agony in John, but we call it because we put them together. Mark tells the story the night before he dies, is prostrate on the ground, &quot;If this all could pass... and the disciples all flee. Now, that's an awful picture. That makes sense to me to a persecuted community who know what it's like to die. That's how you die, Over to John. Jesus is not on the ground The whole cohort of the 600 troops come out and they end up with their faces And Jesus says, &quot;Of course I And Jesus tells them to, He's in command You have a Jesus out of control, a Jesus totally in control Neither of them are historical. I don't think either of them &gt;&gt; Jesus dies on a different day than in Matthew, Mark and Luke. In the three synoptic gospels, Jesus actually eats In John's gospel, he doesn't. The Last Supper before the beginning So here's the scene in John's The day leading up to Passover is the day when all and everyone goes to the temple to get their lamb In Jerusalem, thousands of lambs being And in John's gospel, that's the So that, quite literally, the dramatic scene has Jesus hanging on the cross while the lambs are being &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Here is who takes away the sins &gt;&gt; Jesus doesn't eat Jesus is the Passover meal. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): My flesh and my blood is true drink. Those who eat my mortal flesh and I in them. &gt;&gt; But the idea of drinking is absolutely abhorrent So the very language that is so rich also has a decidedly in terms of the evolving between Jews and Christians. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Throughout Judaism itself was evolving. The role of the synagogue from a meeting place Worship in the synagogue increasingly centered on Torah But John's community saw Jesus and for this conviction, they would be forced out &gt;&gt; (dramatized): The Jews that anyone who confessed Jesus would be expelled &gt;&gt; As I read John, I come One is that this If you want to call them they're Jewish Christians. They're one group The second conclusion is that they are being That is, their appeal is becoming They're becoming smaller and And they can refer to their as &quot;the Jews.&quot; They are feeling from their own Judaism. In plain language, and that means the language gets nastier and nastier. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): &quot;Abraham is our father.&quot; Jesus said to them, &quot;If God were your father, You are from your father, &gt;&gt; So Mark talks about the crowd But by Matthew-- 15 years it's all the people. And by the time you get it is the Jews &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The conflict that John described was still a local experience. But it soon would be swept up between Jews and Romans &gt;&gt; The relationship between after the turn would become more and more partly because that continued to develop. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In the year 132 Jerusalem bristled with rumors planned to rebuild the city dedicating it to Jupiter, the patron god of the city For many Jews, this was worthy of divine vengeance. &gt;&gt; The political expectations did not simply die out Some people, both within Christian tradition still expected to bring a new kingdom on Earth &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Behold, and it will happen when the time and the harvest of the seed of the evil ones has come. &gt;&gt; Within 60 years there would arise We typically call this the &quot;second Jewish revolt or the Bar Kokhba revolt. And it's named who really becomes of this new political period. He's called Bar Kokhba. &gt;&gt; Bar Kokhba was supported by large segments He claimed to be a descendant He claimed to be and was supported than one of the major figures So this war was very different. It was a millennial revolt. It was a messianic revolt. And it touched chords that were &gt;&gt; (dramatized): The Earth's will hate one another &gt;&gt; Apparently, he did take And coins are found now &quot;The year one of the They really think they have &gt;&gt; You might think that there like the first war. But the second war with Rome, was probably even worse Even though Jerusalem the devastation might have even &gt;&gt; Some people tried to press other Jews, into the revolt, saying, &quot;Come join us &quot;You believe God is going to &quot;don't you? Join us.&quot; But the Christians, are starting to say, We already have one.&quot; &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Not long ago, only a few miles archaeologists hit that has finally revealed of Bar Kokhba and his followers. &gt;&gt; Apparently, the rebels hid in these caves during But we know that the Romans and simply camped up waiting for them to starve or come out and give up. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Rubble is still there, &gt;&gt; One of the caves is called and it contains of men, women and children rather than give in Another cave is called and in it were found and other things of daily life. Now, among the letters found is at least one And it's a very interesting because it asks his to bring certain things So they're expecting to hold out &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: 60 years of failed expectations, the Cave of Horrors now stood for the final failure With the death of Bar Kokhba, Jewish expectations and Christians now looked for the return of their messiah. The Kingdom of God was becoming than a spiritual abstraction. &gt;&gt; The self-consciously apocalyptic and messianic forces the issue And at that point, we really see of Jewish tradition becoming clear. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It is a defining The two heirs rabbinic Judaism would now follow separate paths. (crowd chanting and cheering &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In the Roman death became mass entertainment. Amphitheaters demonstrated Convicted criminals to be devoured by wild beasts. In time, those &quot;criminals&quot; would Ever since the time all religions were tolerated provided that their worshippers and sacrificed to the cult It was this that eventually into conflict But at the end Christianity was still The Roman empire and it seemed impossible that the teachings could challenge its influence. &gt;&gt; Religion in the ancient world is very much a part They had no idea of a separation &gt;&gt; Paganism is the rich, native, of traditional society It's a spiritual universe that's with gods and spirits. When you look up into the stars you see the souls of heroes. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Paganism was very The Olympian gods were revered, but this did not prevent their &gt;&gt; You have low-tech religions, People routinely go If you have a sinus infection, if you need somebody to fall if you are betting on a horse and you've lost you go to a professional. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: At the same time, more and more people in more spiritual and personal A fresco in Pompeii celebrating the solemn rites of the ancient Dionysian And newer cults, were taking hold &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Greatest thou rulest over the mid-air Thou art the lady of light &gt;&gt; One would have found, in the major cities a cult of the Egyptian gods. Egyptian cults would have Isis as the ascendant deity. Isis was perceived as being remarkably attentive. Isis would respond to you She would answer your prayers. She had that reputation. One of the most important is what we call That's Isis suckling This is a kind of iconography that appears to have been in the early iconography &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Worshippers of the gathered in secret chapels They would eat sacred meals and celebrate their god's &gt;&gt; The Egyptian cult were two of the great religious and certainly would have posed some of the most difficult &gt;&gt; Most people who study are curious about how would have succeeded in such a powerful And it's not an easy question why this movement succeeded If you think about the gods and you think about what they they looked like the emperor But this religion is saying man, woman, child, slave, is made in the image of God, and is therefore of enormous Now, in a society that's that's an extraordinary message. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But the message was by no means uniform. In Egypt, an astonishing shed light on the enormous of early Christian thought. &gt;&gt; Other than the discovery the most important for much of the early Christian is the manuscript discovery on the Nile River in Egypt. There, in 1945, was discovered in clay jars buried in the &gt;&gt; The discovery at Nag Hammadi whose name was Mohammed Ali, going with his brothers They took their camels which is honeycombed They were digging under that is, for bird droppings, And Mohammed Ali said his, when he was digging underground. And curious, he kept digging, and he was startled to find and next to it was buried Mohammed Ali said he hesitated because he thought there might But hope overcame fear. He said he picked up his mattock and saw particles of gold much to his delight. But a moment later, he realized fragments of papyrus. Inside the jar were 13 volumes &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: What Mohammed Ali were books written known as Coptic. Unable to read them, &gt;&gt; Later, his mother said and threw them into the fire when she was baking bread. What he didn't know until... What we didn't know is that these contained some of the most precious texts that they have uncovered for us of seeing the early Christian &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: What the books was that early Christianity than scholars had suspected, with many different ways &gt;&gt; There were 52 texts unless some of them were burned And they contain secret gospels such as the Gospel of Thomas, They also contain conversations that claim to go back to Jesus all kinds of literature a whole discovery of text but also very different. &gt;&gt; Christianity, or one would of the second and third were, again, a highly variegated We really can't imagine as a unified, coherent &gt;&gt; We probably ought to think as a kind of regional diversity. That is, the Christianity was different than Christianity and that was different and that different or back in Palestine. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Some of the oldest were in western Turkey, where Paul and his followers many of the earliest At the end of the first century, Christians here found themselves with Roman power and authority. &gt;&gt; About the year 112, that brings us on the stage in the history The scene is in the Roman in modern-day Turkey. At that time, there is sent to take over. His name is Pliny the Younger. &gt;&gt; Pliny was a friend and was an extremely respected &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: One of Pliny's In this capacity, with a legal and ethical problem which he described in a letter &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Having never at any trials of the Christians, I am unacquainted to be observed either &gt;&gt; So we have to imagine Pliny in the form a Roman magistrate, enthroned in the tribunal with his guards and his bailiffs And before him stand and Pliny can't figure out who Apparently, they've done that get their neighbors The neighbors have complained and no one is buying certain and they're Christians. And so, somehow or another, Pliny is forced to deal &gt;&gt; Pliny genuinely because he sees what appear being hauled up on trumped-up and simply on that basis, being subject So I think Pliny allows us into the moral that Christianity posed for scrupulous, morally &gt;&gt; (dramatized): The method I interrogated If they confessed it, I repeated adding the threat If they still persevered, &gt;&gt; Pliny allows, how this really is one of the he's ever encountered. And that in itself seems a rather strident attack &gt;&gt; (dramatized): I judged it to extract the real truth, from two female slaves But I could discover nothing more than depraved and excessive &gt;&gt; He says, &quot;They don't really &quot;They meet before daybreak. &quot;They sing hymns antiphonally. And they worship Christ And then he says, &quot;but not an oath &quot;rather an oath not to defraud people, not to &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Those they were or had ever who repeated after me and offered adoration these I thought it proper &gt;&gt; And he says to the emperor, &quot;Do you think I handled it The emperor then writes back &quot;But don't go out looking &quot;And if you get some anonymous &quot;don't take that too seriously. We don't want to set &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Before Pliny, that Christians were a sect &gt;&gt; Because it was considered Christianity was considered by the legal status within the Roman Empire. So when we see Pliny as a separate group, it really marks a departure, a change in the status both in its relationship and in its relationship &gt;&gt; (dramatized): Christians are and are persecuted and those that hate them cannot &gt;&gt; Pliny's program evolved into a very explicit policy that probably was the model throughout a good deal what's now modern Turkey. And that policy was to ask If the answer is no, If they couldn't sacrifice, then that was proof and they could be executed. So Pliny thought, ultimately, that once the matter that he was doing that he was saving the empire from the spread of a dangerous &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It was precisely to make public sacrifice that made Christians seem &gt;&gt; Religion was one of the most of the maintenance of the state. One offered sacrifices as a part of the celebration One offered sacrifices on the Cities very often mounted to celebrate the emperors, and all the populace to come and join in. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: At these great Christians were becoming by their absence. &gt;&gt; When the Christians really do in the social arena the pagans start to take note from important festival days and their unwillingness in certain aspects &gt;&gt; Judaism had long ago come to a legal agreement with Jews would not be forced And pagan rituals are part in a Roman city. Jews were exempted from this because Romans knew about this kind of thing. &gt;&gt; Now, along come this new and they're behaving but they obviously aren't They started under Pontius So it's novel. But if it's novel, it cannot be a religion. Religion is, by definition, So if it's new and novel, it's a superstition, And superstition is, not a good thing. &gt;&gt; We have a good example of the from a little graffiti found An inscription scratched &quot;Alexamenos worships his god.&quot; In the picture, bowing down before the man but the man on the cross &gt;&gt; Christians have made in their own town. And, therefore, they are used whenever there are of human existence-- plague, earthquake, flood. It's because Christians, as Gentiles who are not doing Why should the gods do anything &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Though persecution was still mainly local it was becoming a crime Christians who were charged to recant and make a sacrifice or sacrifice their own lives (crowd cheering in background) &gt;&gt; &quot;In the blood of the martyrs &gt;&gt; One of the most amazing historians of early Christianity is the prison diary of a young I think in the year 202 or 203, as part of a civic celebration. Her name is Perpetua, and &gt;&gt; (dramatized): We were and I was terrified, as I had never been &gt;&gt; Perpetua has brought herself to the attention and she is really insisting There's an incredibly powerful where Perpetua's father and finally, actually, And the governor has him subdued And the governor says, And Perpetua says, Now, there's no dragnet out Perpetua is visited by other If the governor were trying all the Christians in Carthage, he just could have arrested whoever is going but he doesn't. &gt;&gt; She's pregnant during part and only gives birth just before She has to give at the moment that she is &gt;&gt; (dramatized): In my dream, I saw a ladder made of bronze, reaching At the foot of the ladder lay and it would attack those &quot;He will not harm me,&quot; I said, &gt;&gt; The authentic diary ends before Perpetua is led What we have concluding is a description done who is presenting a hero tale. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): The day and they marched from the prison as if they were going to heaven. &gt;&gt; She's led out into the and about to be set upon She really goes with a great of authority, and stature, (crowd cheering in background) (lions growling in background) &gt;&gt; She faces down the animals. And finally, after being a young gladiator is sent And his... It's just His hand is trembling so much, and she grabs his hand and guides his sword (crowd cheering in background) &gt;&gt; The stories of the martyrs are all hero stories, and they're all intended, as ways of strengthening If we read only we would suppose and that the church flourishes Obviously, If we actually tote up that we can identify, it's a really quite small number during which Christianity of being the outsiders. &gt;&gt; We don't have being martyred. What we do have is admiring the few (crowd cheering in background) &gt;&gt; The story of the martyrdom is a very important milestone in the development because of what the story about the perception We can see the contrast At the time of Pliny, at the Christians are And so even when he executes he really doesn't know Within 100 years, when Perpetua meets her death Christianity has become (crowd cheering in background) The death of Perpetua is a story of a very significant change It had begun to be a part &gt;&gt; Now that Christianity has as something not Judaism, the question that Christians now &quot;What is Christianity?&quot; The second century is an age in which the Christian Church was trying to figure out What exactly is the new church? &gt;&gt; Certainly, there were some such as the ecclesiae, the bishop, the deacons, There were institutions in some Christian churches, and this was not universal, &gt;&gt; We have, in effect, living, often, side by side, At one point, in Rome, Justin Martyr has his Christian and the Gnostic teacher in another school in Rome, and another so-called heretic is also in Rome, all of these alongside that developed as part &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: There were about how Christians One group following felt that Easter should fall Others thought they should and celebrate during the solar on a Sunday. And Marcion wanted to strip away that smacked &gt;&gt; Marcion was a wealthy He came to Rome, and he gave and they welcomed him But he felt that was no longer preserved, and he thought had the true gospel. And he set out to find and he took the gospel of Luke and purified it from whatever and said, &quot;This should be and this should be the only And the Roman church became of his manipulations It is reported that they gave &quot;Thank you very much, but we &gt;&gt; This is where we start to see a kind of proliferation all over the empire. And by the third there are more gospels and certainly more than you can &gt;&gt; The Gospel of Mary Magdalene, shows us a Christian community in which Mary Magdalene as a leader, as one of and one who claims that women &gt;&gt; Another text called is not a narrative of the death and resurrection It's a symbolic reflection that come from scripture or are associated with the life &gt;&gt; We also hear of other kinds stories of the birth In lurid detail, really, or how marvelous and miraculous stories of traveling apostles Thomas, who goes to India, Andrew, who goes out and so on. These kinds of stories through the second and third &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: One of the at Nag Hammadi was a complete copy Written in Syria in the second this collection of sayings proved very influential... &gt;&gt; The Gospel of Thomas is It simply goes along and says, Jesus said this, Well, some of these things according are quite familiar. They're very similar to things but not identical. &gt;&gt; &quot;Give to Caesar what belongs &quot;give to God what belongs and give to me what is mine.&quot; &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: These sayings are filled with familiar, like the parable But others are strange &gt;&gt; &quot;Look to the living one &quot;for you might die. &quot;And then try to see and you will be unable to see.&quot; &gt;&gt; My favorite of these is &quot;If you bring forth &quot;what you bring forth &quot;If you do not bring forth what you do not bring forth &gt;&gt; Now, what is typical about in each instance, if you want to understand you have to recognize yourself, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: With its emphasis and Jesus as the revealer some scholars think became a source for a competing known as Gnosticism. &gt;&gt; Paul and Paulian Christianity would have placed on Jesus' death and resurrection and the saving power Gnostic Christianity, would have placed in fact, its prime emphasis, on the message, the wisdom, the &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Most Gnostics that Jesus was so divine that he had never entered and so could not This brought Gnostics into &gt;&gt; It was very important as really suffering and dying because Christians were to suffer and die as witnesses, And if, with some Gnostics, you could denigrate you might call into question and to bear witness &gt;&gt; Bishop Irenaeus, who wrote in the second century was about 18 to 20 years old zwhen his little community by a devastating persecution. They say that 50 to 70 people were tortured and executed. 50 to 70 people executed is a devastating destruction And Irenaeus was trying to unify What frustrated him is that they didn't all believe They didn't all gather And he, like others, of the dangers of fragmentation. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Irenaeus thundered against those he saw including &gt;&gt; (dramatized): who blaspheme the creator, as do all the falsely be recognized as agents of Satan &gt;&gt; Bishop Irenaeus coined Now, literally in Greek, &quot;orthodox&quot; means It's like &quot;orthodontia&quot; means I mean, &quot;orthodox&quot; means And those who didn't agree he called &quot;heterodox&quot;-- that means simply thinking or &quot;heretics,&quot; which means people about what to think. Irenaeus didn't want people he wanted them thinking what the bishop told them &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Irenaeus had not only with those who believed but also with who believed that Jesus by just one gospel. He looked for a compromise. &gt;&gt; Irenaeus says that the number these are the earliest, but four is the right number. After all, there's four corners there's four winds; and there are four beasts who reveal God's will Four is the right number; &gt;&gt; The story implied is that somewhere in the second century, and a bunch of these cigar-smoking got together, and they decided who was going It was a wrap. They closed up, and then everything else was and the janitors took away I think precisely the contrary is closer to a more responsible and that is that there is among people as to what constitutes reliable literature-- literature that they want that they want to hear over and other kinds of literature &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: One criterion was whether the gospel told of the suffering and death This was crucial to the emerging because the centerpiece the celebration cannot live without that story. &gt;&gt; And it is out that the four-gospel canon And it comes, as a canon that preserves within limits, There is no claim that this that are all saying It is, rather, an attempt as many Christian communities &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: By the middle Christians were buried alongside underground tombs There is evidence here of the growing homogenization The artwork on the tombs shows They are largely scenes which are now merging &gt;&gt; What's interesting is what because what they choose is especially the healer. He appears beardless, He's a new, young god, He's not an old fuddy-duddy like And what's extraordinary is, he would either have his hand on the person he's healing. Now, nothing that I know of ever shows Asclepius with his Jesus is an Asclepius I think this is one of the great Jesus is not shown he's down there with his hand on people's heads. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The art also illustrates to integrate &gt;&gt; As Christianity moved into the more pagan sphere, then all sorts of pagan ideas and all sorts of pagan themes start pouring &gt;&gt; We have this figure with the sheep draped We, now, may tend to think as reflecting the gospel stories or Jesus as the good shepherd In point of fact, this is the virtue of love of humanity, and it's one of the most of Roman civic and public life. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: All around the ancient pagan gods lingered and immemorial shrines. But their power &gt;&gt; Roman society, Roman law, are both highly tolerant as long as you do the things which every Roman is expected sort of those religious acts Nobody cares what you believe Then appears Christianity, which is intolerant, which will not allow you to do And it's a profound shock to It appears as a dangerous rival as it begins to grow strong. &gt;&gt; Christian writers throughout the middle and later developed the techniques of trying to argue was really a superior religion, because it was monotheistic, and that it... Christians exemplified higher than did pagans. They pointed to examples of great virtue, self-sacrifice and These Christian apologists also in a way that might not They laughed at the various that formed the basis for They laughed at the stories their adulteries, their goings-on with each other, and could really make mincemeat &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The ideas that had were being reinterpreted. In the uncompromising language Jesus had preached the message Now, Jesus himself became and the source of eternal life. &gt;&gt; The message promised spiritual gifts that went beyond and promised also immortality, promised a future life from sickness and from disease, and individual isolation, There is a future but one should not simply on the level &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: To the subjects Christianity offered dignity in this life But it was also winning converts by offering a helping hand &gt;&gt; For example, like other elements of the the followers of Jesus tended take care of people so that they wouldn't become and orphans, and so forth. That was a primary obligation and Jesus' followers certainly &gt;&gt; Of course, there was in the ancient world. Wealthy Romans had given money such as the feeding of children, But even such programs didn't compare in size and scope &gt;&gt; So Christianity really a realm of mutual social support for the members And I think that this has... was probably, in the long run, for the success &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: By the year 250, that a stronger was needed to administer It was becoming a state Meanwhile, Rome's rulers felt their control of the empire and Christian undermining was no longer to be tolerated. &gt;&gt; The middle is often identified as a crisis This is a time when the emperor There is a sense that we are that the barbarians may be the Persians are dangerous, and so on. And so there's a great sense that anything that upsets between the Romans and the gods After a long period in which the persecutions were really spasmodic, local, suddenly, in the middle of the the emperor Decius decides that Christians are a real enemy that they must be dealt with. They must be dealt with with all the police power that the emperor &gt;&gt; Christians could be arrested simply because they bore the That was enough, to convict one and the crime was So put yourself in the... in the if you were, say, a merchant and wanted to limit all you had to do was point fingers and say, &quot;Well, you know, Well, by Roman convention, those people then could be &gt;&gt; What you have to do is get It's a chit saying for the well-being And you go and there's a whole on the part of different You can have your servant go He might also be a Christian, but, you know, Pay him, he'll get two chits, and then you're covered Or you can pay for the ticket but not actually do if you can bribe who is a magistrate. Or you can just go ahead knowing that these gods After all, that's right that these gods are nothing. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): As to the we know that no idol and that there is no God &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Decius to be completely ruthless in persecuting those who refused For the first time, were methodically rounded up. &gt;&gt; And the odd thing is, The net effect of this is that a new cult of the martyrs which strengthens the church. (crowd cheering in background) &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But ironically, very few Christians were willing &gt;&gt; Many Christians were not made of the people who went that they had been willing to offer a pinch of incense &gt;&gt; Christians were sort of We know this from the so-called What do you do who took to the hills as opposed to standing their &gt;&gt; All this made a grave problem when the persecutions were over, because many of these people to come back into the church. There were many controversies &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: 50 years later, the emperor Diocletian to wipe out the Christians. He targeted those but the persecution failed partly because were now so entrenched &gt;&gt; Christians wanted knowledgeable and capable So we find that a large number of people are Christians, because they could read which constituted a big problem with the persecution because they were thrown first when the persecution and suddenly, didn't work anymore. &gt;&gt; By that time, that they can't possibly they've already grown that much. So in a sense, the persecution until it's already too late. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: By now, the Jesus to every corner &gt;&gt; The last decades you get a great insurge There are some scholars in Egypt, for example, there would actually be maybe a rather slight majority, but nonetheless &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The turning point in the history occurred in the first decades It was a transformation filled It was brought about by a Roman general not Jesus, but Apollo, &gt;&gt; One of the most surprising in the entire tradition, is Constantine. He is, first of all, He is, also, the son and at the head of the army and he's fighting struggling for who is going at the top of the heap the very higher echelons What happens is that Constantine &gt;&gt; In the dream, a cross appears The sun was very important He had a thing about Helios and very often represented with the sun god. But the intrusion of the cross and below this vision were the words, en touto nike. And he interpreted this dream to mean that, by this symbol he could defeat his archenemy at the battle and become sole emperor. And so he had his-- he had his soldiers paint Constantine won the battle became the sole emperor and then, in a dramatic shift relocates the center from the eternal city, Rome, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: To reunite Constantine moved the capital to a more strategic location, and renamed it Constantinople. &gt;&gt; An important part of what was was jockeying Clearly, by the end Christianity was a major force throughout the empire, and something that had or had to be integrated. Galerius, Constantine's rival, who was one of the major favored the option Constantine and his associates favored the option &gt;&gt; Constantine was and a consummate politician. And I think he gauged well the upsurge of interest Christianity was, was receiving, and so played up to that and exploited it &gt;&gt; When Constantine and started to favor he did do many things a support for Christianity. He gave money for the building money for the copying he exempted clergy members from having to perform that kind of thing. &gt;&gt; The bishops are able to take and his curious intellectual like Christology and the Trinity They're able to have Bibles They're finally able to have and big basilicas. So there's a comfortable between the empire &gt;&gt; All that certainly stands of his true Christian On the other hand, he did retain with the sun god on it. He did say the day of the sun but it's very unclear meant the day dedicated or the day dedicated to Jesus &gt;&gt; Whatever one finally decides about the nature whether it's a real, it has profound impact upon the future Constantine's patronage doesn't that a lot of new churches though it means that. It doesn't just mean that the salaries of bishops though it means that. It doesn't just mean that Christians have freedom now It means that it has become part and obviously, that is going for the society &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Constantine showed by massive building programs, especially in Jerusalem. Ironically, the city that was was being rebuilt by another. But the new holy places in this were now all Christian. To strengthen his new church, Constantine called in organization and teaching. But such unity came at a cost. &gt;&gt; One of the first things is start persecuting The Gnostic Christians Marcionite Christians, Christians who don't have as part of their canon-- are targeted. The list of enemies There's a kind of, in a sense, as one emperor ruling one empire tries to have &gt;&gt; To appreciate the remarkable, that had occurred one might counterpose in his courtroom sending Christians simply for being called to the majesty of Constantine presiding over the great that he had called The imperium, on the one hand, being used clearly to extinguish the imperium, on the other hand, to undergird and support the same religious movement, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The cross, the hated symbol of death now emerged as the symbol And in the eyes of some, the apocalyptic prophecy had at last been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; (dramatized): The kingdom has become the kingdom &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The Kingdom of God had now become one and the same. Jesus of Nazareth had become and his church had become A new chapter in history was &gt;&gt; Frontline's &quot;From Jesus to is available on DVD. To order, visit shopPBS.org. Or call 1-800-PLAY-PBS.
