[Adum] -This is a very special event for all of us, because none of us have seen this masterpiece before. Who else is here? I'm Adam. [Gael] -I'm Gael. [Scoot] -Oh, I thought we were going to do a thing where we just... [Adum] -Just... just don't talk?! Yeah where it's just me. [Scoot] -Just let Adam hang himself. [Adum] -It's difficult to believe I've never watched this, honestly. [Gael] -Is this planet Earth too? [Adum] -No, it's After Earth 2. [Scoot] -Three. [Adum] -Oh my god! Good catch! [Gael] -Oh my god... [Adum] -That was dope... [Scoot] -That was a sick catch! [Scoot] -Get... oh... oh why can't the movie be about that guy?? Who could catch deer out of the air! [Adum] -Robert Pattinson's career has done great things since this film. [Scoot] -I was about to say, Robert Pattinson's career and Kristen Stewart's career have gone in the exact same directions... [Adum] -Yeah, funny story: I had taken a break from reading novels for quite some time when I was younger. I got a gift card to Chapters - Indigo for my birthday or Christmas or something. I was like &quot;You know what? I'm gonna read again!&quot; So, I go to the bookstore and there's this huge display for this book series. I'm like, you know &quot;it's popular so this must be good; I guess, right? Like, the cover looked interesting- [Scoot] -Popular always equals good! [Adum] -and then I started reading and I'm like &quot;well, this is fucking awful&quot; and I gave it away. It was Twilight... [Scoot chuckles] [Gael] -Oh my god... [Scoot] -&quot;and I never read again...&quot; [Adum] -Yeah. [Scoot] -And hey, it and it's the native American guy who plays every native American role in every movie, good for him. [Gael] -Oh, was it was was he the one from one flew over the cuckoo's nest too? [Scoot] -He was Cuckoo's Nest.... he was the Last of the Mohicans... [Gael] -He was all of them. [Scoot] -He was the third it was also the third last of the Mohicans [Adum] -Even without having seen these films, I very much understood the complaint about her performance. Being that she doesn't really emote, she like kind of talks under her breath, and doesn't really express much emotion or whatever... [Scoot] -You know, she's on heroin the entire time. [Adum] -Yeah, and... and it was like, okay now she's in these indie french movies that I'm watching, and everybody's praising her performance and I'm watching them I'm like, this is exactly what people described her performance from Twilight as... and now she's winning awards... [Scoot] -She just found the right place to do it. She's a genius! [Clip] -anything you need, tour guide, lunch date, shoulder cry on... [Scoot] -Whoa! [Adum] -Is he gay? [Gael] -That's quite fast. Also, he's wearing a tie the first day of high school...? [Adum] -Okay, there's a school shooter. All right, keep your eye on him... It's like that that PSA where the whole movie happens and then it's like &quot;here's what you should have been looking at...&quot; He was planning a school shooting... [Clip] -So what'd you do about it? -I didn't do anything. -Well... what... -Guys, don't be like my friend here who didn't do anything. Not doing anything is part of the problem. -Oh, you're... you're homegirl. Yeah. -Yeah. -My girl! [Adum] -Oh my god! [Gael] -Oh, what the fuck? Anna Kendrick kind of looks like Stephanie Meyer. A little bit... She wrote herself into the movie, but then got camera shy... [Adum] -No, let's be honest. She wrote herself as the main fucking character, because she wants to fantasize about having to choose between necrophilia and bestiality. Right? That's her fucking fantasy... Do I take the vampire or the werewolf? [Gael] -You're spoiling this for me right now. This is my first watch, Adam! [Music] Everybody's makeup or the color palette? Everybody looks way too white, but I guess Stephanie Meyer is Mormon so she probably requested that. [Scoot] -Yeah, a little from column A, a little from column B.... Oh, the whitest of them all!! [Gael] -What is that? Did you see? What is that reaction? Just went like... like, a little bit. [Scoot] -Even from the little we've seen so far, Kristen Stewart the actress seems uncomfortable to be here. Like, is she doing this movie at gunpoint? [Gael] -Oh my god! What? Holy fuck! [Scoot] -That was quick. [Music] [Adum] -Ahhh ha haaa! This look! [Gael] -He's doing like, a little squint. [Clip] -I have homework to do. [Adum] -I really don't see the difference between this and personal shopper, in terms of just her performance and her character. I really don't... [Scoot] -There isn't! [Adum] -Like, this one she wants to fuck a vampire the other one she wants to fuck a ghost, I guess... [Scoot laughs] [Scoot] -Yep [Adum] -You're lame... [Adum laughs] -Those faces she makes! [Gael] -What? Are these...? Are these faces jokes? [Adum] -Yeah, like... [Scoot] -Is she playing a joke on us? [Adum] -Okay, this is important. [Adum] -Yeah, she's gonna come again... Look at his stare! Women need porn too... [Gael] -Yeah, that's true. [Adum] -So, they direct vampire movies... [Scoot] -I love that this is like it is a sad woman's understanding of porn. No I completely agree, but it's just really funny. [Adum] -This whole scene... [Adum] -There's the school shooter! He's in the background again! It's like the PSA! [Scoot] -Wait, should we be watching that guy?? [Adum] -Yeah, if you like look into what he's looking at it's like a small picture of a gun... It's a map of the school. [Gael] -Oh my god... She looks so angry... [Adum] -I don't know what to interpret from these looks really... She's like... drugged up... I think she's drugged up... [Scoot] -She looks scared all the time! [Gael] -Can we appreciate that she's actually such a good actress that we're all drawing different interpretations of her performance? [Adum] -Very nuanced performance, lets say. [Gael] -Like you're seein scared, I'm seeing angry, Adam's seeing like, I don't know disinterested... [Adum] -There's the school shooter again! He's back! [Scoot] -Get him! Tackle him! [Adum] -Ah! -Those cuts... I like how one of those shots was slowed down a little... [Adum] -That was really funny... [Adum] -All right, that was like what? 20 cuts in five seconds? [Gael] -Oh my god, he put his... he put his.... [Gael] -He put his arm on her waist! Why... why did you need to do that? To save her? [Scoot] -Does she still look angry to you? [Gael laughs] [Scoot] -Is this still anger? [Clip] -The chief's daughter was here. -No, doctor- [Adum] -Everybody looks so stupid! [Scoot] -This guy.... FOX... [Gael] -Dude, I would... yeah, let's go there... -Can I talk to you for a minute? [Gael] -&quot;Rosalie&quot; Why doesn't he just call her Morticia, while he's at it? Everyone's got like a fuckin'... [Scoot] -Gomez Morticia. [Gael] -Names from 55 million years ago... -You.... you stopped the van! [Adum bursts out laughing] [Adum] -I can't deal with anything that she's doing! [Scoot laughs] [Adum] -I can't I'm deal with her... [Gael] -I don't know why you... I'm loving it... [Scoot] -Hello. [Gael] -Okay... [Adum] -Oh, that's funny... Every single moment of like implied intimacy or sexuality in this movie, I just- like you have to remember that this is through the lens of Stephanie Meyer being like, &quot;yeah this is MY fantasy.&quot; Right?! She wants to wake up with a stalker staring her down from her bed! -I mean you don't even say hi to me. -Hi. [Adum] -Ha ha... this is so awkward... [Gael] -I love it. -That's what's in Jackson- [Adum] -Quit falling! Let's take our bets: how many more times is she going to fall in the series or in this movie? [Gael] -Let's do in this movie first. [Adum] -In this movie? I'm giving... I'm giving at least two more falls... I'm gonna... I'm gonna get brave and say three. [Gael] -I was gonna highball it. [Adum] -And trips count, by the way. [Gael] -Trips count, I'm gonna go five. [Scoot] -Sure. [Gael] -I'm gonna go five more for this film. I will keep my high ball. -Are you going to be riding with us? [Gael] -Is that Olivia Coleman? [Adum] -Yes. [chuckling] [Scoot] -Yeah, she's aged... not great. [Gael] -She's a very versatile actress. -Okay, I'll go if you stop saying that. -Seriously dude... -it's creepy... [Adum] -There's the school shooter! [Scoot] -Good eye. [Adum] -That was hilarious.. [Scoot] -I think that was fuckin' smooth... [Gael] -That was a magic! -Did you know Quileute's are supposedly descended from [Adum] -Oh, he's talking about wolves now! [Scoot] -Hold on, are we evolutionarily explaining werewolves? [Gael] -We are. I'm ready... I'm ready... I'm ready... I want to hear this! -So what's the story about the Cullins? [Scoot] -They're descended from bats. -Well they're supposedly descended from this like.... enemy clan... [Adum] -&quot;Enemy clan&quot; [Gael] -Ooh, they all had good hats! -snazzy hats... [Adum] -I don't like how he's wearing his headphones. There's no reason for that... [Scoot] -No, it's disgusting... [Scoot] -Oh, what was THAT effect? [Adum] -That was weird... -Hello. [Gael] -&quot;hello.&quot; [Adum] -Hello. [Obi Wan] -Hello there. -Why are you doing this? -Let's not play with our food. [Adum] -This is so funny! [Gael] -This is something... oh my god... this is writing... I have the Blu-ray in front of me, and it- [Adum] -We have the french... because it's Canada... [Gael] -Yeah, it's Canada. So, by law we have to have it in two languages. So, the title of the film is on the on the cover, obviously. It's just Twilight. All lower case... and then underneath it in french: La Fascination. [Adum] -The Fascination... [Scoot] -The Fascination, you say... [Gael] -It's an interesting um... &quot;translation.&quot; [Adum] -Oh no... [Scoot] -Oh, rape scene... [Gael] -What's she doing? [Adum] -Rape scene, rape scene. [SCoot] -Rape scene, rape scene. [Scoot] -Well, tokyo drift- [Adum] -It's amazing that I could tell she kicked him in the crotch, with how close those shots were. [Gael] -It's because it's good filmmaking, Adam! [Adum] -So, why does a vampire have a deep growl? I thought that was a thing for werewolves... [Scoot] -Why does a vampire have a Volvo? [Adum] -Ah! She keeps biting her lip! What is this?! [Scoot] -She's a lip bit- it's her method! [Adum] -She got cast! For something... [Scoot] -She did she beat out other people for this role. [Gael] -I want to see the audition tapes... -I heard what those lowlifes were thinking... -You read minds? [Adum] -Yeah... they were thinking they were going to rape you. If that wasn't already clear by them attempting to rape you... [Scoot chuckles] [Scoot] -Yeah, somehow I could tell... -Sex... Cat... [Adum] -HA! &quot;Sex, cat&quot; [Gael] -Uh.... [Gael] -We should have done &quot;how many more lip bites will there be?&quot; [Adum] -That's not possible to keep count! [Scoot] -Man has not created an abacus... so large... [Gael] -Oh... they both reached for.... [Adum laughs] I'm getting titanic vibes, guys! [Adum] -She's on some serious drugs... All right, we've established a lot. This is 47 minutes through- [Gael] -Holy shit! This movie is flying by... [Adum] -Uhhhh.... brah.... [Scoot] -Yeah, I don't know. Do the sparkles not come until later movies? [Adum] -They don't come until she comes... [Gael] -Either later in this movie or later in- [Adum] -Oh my god, you didn't film it in a high frame rate, but you slowed it down anyway... you fuckin' assholes... [Scoot] -That's correct... [Gael] -It was 2008, they were just- [Adum] -2008 is too late! It's 2000 late... [Scoot] -Two thousand and late! [Gael] -Oh, what's this? [Adum] -Speed it up... [Gael] -They're like, guys- [Scoot] -No, this is perfect. No, do it just like this... [Gael] -Is this the Matrix? Did they get like 500 cameras? [Scoot] -I think this is the Matrix... [Gael] -they get 500 cameras- [Scoot] -Where them Wachowskis at? -Vampire... [Scoot] -It even said when she was doing her google research... Oh, look at 'em go! I'm sorry, I can't talk over this this! [Adum] -This is really funny... [Scoot] -You better fuckin' sparkle! [Scoot] -YEESSS! [Adum] -Okay, so now you're saying like, &quot;real&quot; sunlight... [Gael] -It's not as bad as I thought it would be.... [Adun] -There are no clouds. [Clip] -It's like diamonds! [Adum cackles] [Adum] -&quot;It's like DIAMONDS!&quot; [continues cackling] -I'm here, I trust you. [Adum] -Ah... woah... Crazy... [Scoot] -Is he showing off? [Adum] -He is! I don't know- there's no point to any of this... I think I saw the shooter... Oh, there he is! There he is, he's on the left! [Scoot] -Got him! [Laughter] [Gael] -Oh, that was good. -giving us an excuse to use the kitchen for the first time. -I hope you're hungry. -Yeah, absolutely! -She already ate. [Adum] -Okay, so they're all vampires? Oh fucking god... [Gael] -Bit of an overreaction... -Jasper's our newest vegetarian it's a little difficult for... -It's a pleasure to meet you. [Scoot] -Has the actor who plays Jasper spoken to humans before? -Graduation caps? [Scoot] -Oh, they're all the times he's graduated; that none of the teachers have noticed, cause they're retarted... [Adum] -All right, it's uh... it's been an hour and ten minutes... [Gael] -Does this count as a fall? I'm getting desperate... [Scoot] -No, that's like the opposite of a fall... [Adum] -Uh, I love- I love the &quot;pretend to climb while they're pulling him up with the rope&quot; thing. It's like, he's clearly not gripping the tree. He's like touching it like Spider-Man. [Adum] -Everything that's happened so far I would expect as like... the setup for a film... [Gael] -I guess... yeah.... But, we're over halfway through the movie... There's no conflict yet. [Adum] -That's... fucking Stephanie Meyer! [Scoot] -Oh, it is! [Gael] -We got a little Hitchcock moment! -How did you get in here? -The window... -Do you do that a lot? -Just the past couple of months. [Scoot] -I like breaking and entering. [Gael] -Oh my god, that's so hot! You've been stalking me while I sleep... -I like watching you sleep... [Gael] -Okay... All right... [Adum] -Ah.... could you imagine you being a character that never sleeps, but you're so bored that you watch someone else sleep? I don't care how in love with her you are... I like that... classic iPod on the right. [Scoot] -Two gigabytes? [Gael] -No, are you crazy? It was like 512 megabytes or some shit... [Adum] -Gael, I think the first iPod might have been over a gigabyte... [Gael] -You're probably right... [Adum] -Because, one cd is 750 megabytes. And this was after CD's. [Gael] -No, but they were compressed. No but, the songs were compressed- [Adum] -Yeah, I guess they were mp3 players. [Gael] -Yeah. [Adum] -I guess it's the convenience of not having to use a cd. This is a very interesting movie. [Scoot] -Let's talk about Walkman's. [Scoot] -Did you guys have Walkman's? Oh, she throws like a girl! She's been alive for a thousand years and still can't throw! [Adum] -Can you imagine a concept for a scene being fast vampire baseball? Because, that's what just happened... This is the concept of the scene... Fast vampire baseball... [Scoot] -It sounds like a filmmaking dare... Like, I'm gonna give you a weird phrase and see if you can film it... [Adum] -Yeah, it's like a parody movie. Oh no, we were just having a fun baseball game and now there's gonna be a fight or something... [Gael] -Oh this... I'm loving this music! I am loving this music... -Could you use three more players? [Gael] -Oh, she's gonna get outed, because uh... [Adum] -Yeah... yeah, she'll be uh they'll be like, &quot;why don't you go up to the bat?&quot; Falls! You're not a vampire! [Adum] -So, it's just Edward Cullen's family that's vegetarian, and all the other vampires are not...? [Scoot] -Yeah, and they think the Cullen's are gay... [African accent] -Why are you gay? [Adum] -Oh, this is so funny! We haven't even seen pointy teeth! I'll never forget this quote from M. Knight Shyamalan. He said that, &quot;This film was totally perfect.&quot; He wanted to direct one of the twilight movies. He said, &quot;Catherine Hardwick's version was totally perfect.&quot; was his quote... [Gael] -Uh, why is that not on the back of the DVD cover? [Clip] -He thought Catherine Hardwick's version was totally perfect. [Adum] -Oh, I've always heard it as &quot;totally...&quot; not tonally... She totally says &quot;tonally.&quot; That's crazy... -Bella, you are my life, now... [Adum] -Yeah, you're my whole life... I've never experienced any kind of romantic relationship like this before... [Scoot] -In my century on this Earth... We met on what? Wednesday? [Adum] -I've been living for SO LONG and you're just so perfect... just for existing... Remember: through the lens of Stephanie Meyer, this is her fucking fantasy... [Scoot] -I have never seen anyone bite their lip more than you... [Adum] -All you had to do is just say &quot;I'm not scared&quot; and do stupid faces and I love you more than any you're my entire life now. Dwayne got COVID and so did Robert Pattinson... [Scoot] -That's right. [Adum] -I hope Robert Pattinson's okay. I hope Dwayne dies... in a video game... [Scoot] -Wow interesting! Very- very uh... disparate opinions on those two guys... [Adum] -I hope he plays Minecraft and then falls into lava because he was digging downwards... [Scoot] -So, this guy is less a vampire than just a creep? [Adum] -THERE'S TOO MANY MIRRORS! WHICH ONE'S THE REAL ONE!! [Gael] -That's my favorite movie trope. I wish we had more of them... [Adum] -Everything that's happening... it's just one of those things where it's like, yes if you leave it up to the imagination of some 13 year old girl reading it... [Scoot] -This is what you get... [Adum] -That's probably fine... right? [Music] [Laughter] [Scoot] -You didn't give a shit! [Gael] -Oh my god! The wire work! [Adum] -She didn't even jump. [Adum] -Uhhhhh.... [Gael] -A little blood play... [Scoot] -She's getting her ass kicked... [Adum] -This is all a part of Stephanie's fantasy... [Scoot] -Absolutely It's very important while you're watching this to know that every frame of it... [Gael] -Is a painting? [Scoot] -makes Stephanie Meyer cum. [Gael] -Ah... [Scoot] -Every frame, a painting that makes Stephanie Meyer cum. [Adum] -Oh, they're biting each other... and I'm on the ground cuming... [Scoot] -Yeah, and I'm sort of getting off to this... [Gael] -Oh, you got here. [Adum] -Oh no, now- now they can't do anything, because all of us are here! It's almost like we all should have just stuck together the entire time! [Adum] -Fuck off! [Adum cackling obnoxiously] [Adum] -Good neck crack... [Gael] -Why did they stop the sun- [Adum] -Why is it fire? [Scoot] -Why did fire happen? Why would fire happen? Guys, what's up with the fire? Why fire? -Try to suck the venom out. [Scoot] -&quot;Suck the venom out&quot;? -Was he a snake? [Adum] -Oh no... now you have to suck me... I don't think that's how it works... It's like, in your fucking bloodstream you idiot... -Edward... stop... [Adum] -That face! -Oh.... [Gael] -Is there music playing right now? [Scoot] -Wait, we could have just started the movie here! [Gael] -Probably actually... [Scoot] -We're seeing everything... [Gael] -Wait, she fell a lot of times in that, by the way... [Scoot] -Oh, so many falls! [Adum] -Oh my god we fuckin' forgot... -I've fallen and I can't get up! -What happened? -Well, when you fell you broke your leg. [Gael] -Oh my god, you fell! They said it! -Bella, you gotta go to Jacksonville. -So I can't hurt you anymore... [Adum] -You didn't do anything! The entire problem happened because you split up! I don't know, there's gonna be more conflict... [Gael] -That problem got solved. [Adum] -There's another ffff- I guess we're pretty close to the end, aren't we? [Laughter] [Adum] -There's another five minutes of the movie! There's other movies! There's got to be some more conflict! -Jacob. [Gael] -I haven't seen you all movie... [Adum] -You were established earlier... [Scoot] -Yeah, are you in this movie even? -My dad paid me to come talk to you. [Adum] -Because, you're lame... -He wants you to break up with your boyfriend. [Adum] -Oh no, this con- the REAL conflict starts! [Adum] -Oh no, who will I decide? I gotta break up my boyfriend... -I'll take if from here. [Gael] -Oh my god, yes! Yes that subtle squint... give me more of that... [Scoot] -Yeah... [Gael] -Can we put the other one on, like immediately? [Adum] -Guys, we made it to the end of the movie they're kissing! [Gael] -Oh oh oh! [Adum] -Because, they've never kissed the entire time! [Gael] -It better be- [Adum] -I can't believe how much nothing there was... in this movie... [Gael] -What are you talking about? It was a mas- [Scoot] -This is... unless something insane happens in the next five minutes this was the whole movie... [Adum] -I'm pretty sure the credits are gonna start rolling soon. We're coming up to the the final chapter. [Gael] -Pretty sure this was a perfect movie, honestly. [Gael] -Oh, what's going on here? Okay, different songs? [Adum] -Music video time! [Gael] -Is that? [Scoot] -Oh, are they going to show the uh are they going to show thebloopers over- THAT WAS THE WHOLE MOVIE! [Adum laughs] [Adum] -Totally perfect. quote M. Night. [Scoot] -I mean when you're right, you're right. More like &quot;Am Right&quot; Shyamalan. [Gael] -Hey... [Scoot] -So like, in theory: this was also the plot of the first book, right? [Adum] -That's insane! [Scoot] -and somehow that was that's wildly successful and spawned a franchise? [Gael] -You could do a book- [Adum] -That's a whole fuckin' book, right there... I think most of it was just probably the internal dialogue of Bella Swan going like, &quot;he's so dreamy...&quot; [Gael] -I'm glad all that got translated into her stellar acting... [Scoot] -I hope he bite me... [Adum] -What was your favorite scene? [Gael] -Oh, that's so hard- [Scoot] -Let me tell you what my favorite scene was, sir. Now that you ask, as a matter of fact. Thank you for asking... My favorite scene was when the guy got the goddamn deer out of midair and I want to see HIS movie... [Gael] -I was quite hyped when the other vampires started walking towards them during the baseball scene. Like, right after that... [Adum] -My favorite scene was when he was staring at her awkwardly in the classroom... [Gael] -In the bedroom and then he said &quot;I like watching you sleep.&quot; It's fascinating... [Adum] -Well I guess I'm down- like, not tonight but like, I'm down to continue this... I'm- I'm down to do another one of these at some point. [Gael] -All righty then! [Adum] -All right. [Scoot] -We'll look into it... [Adum] -Peace! Synecdoche! We're all gonna die, bye!
