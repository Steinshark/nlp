- Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. If you're just joining this nuclear submarine deep dive series, boy have I got a treat for you. We have covered a ton of stuff that happens on board nuclear submarines. We looked at sonar, we looked at torpedoes how to make air, food, water, all this stuff, the command structure. This has been a the USS Toledo, as it participates We're under the ice in It's awesome. So today's video is the next We're going to end the whole series by surfacing through the ice, which is fascinating than I could imagine, but I needed a video to try to catch all the things that didn't So today on Smarter Every Day, we're going to talk about all these things that you about life on board a nuclear submarine, until you find yourself So, to get started I want to show you a game It's called cribbage. I saw it in the crew's mess, I saw it in the ward room and I saw it in the chief's quarters. This is a game that involves cards and using a clever arrangement of numbers and stuff like that, and pegs to keep track of your score. If you were looking closely you could see above the white board that Chief Luth was using there was a scoreboard of sorts between the captain and That's how important So, I mean this is a So what's the deal with cribbage? This is like the second or - [Submariner] It's like a that's moving around. - [Destin] Yeah, oh-- - [Naval Officer] That's why it's a Naval like a Navy tradition. - [Destin] 'Cause of the pegs 'cause if the boat's - So in all sailing ships and they put the pegs in - [Destin] That's awesome. - It's like the underwear thing. Just to waste some time, - [Destin] Really? - Do some math quick in your head. - [Destin] Really? It's pretty fun? - Yes, a lot of fun. - [Destin] So like all submariners know how to play cribbage. - Most It's not all of us. - [Destin] Who's the best? - He claims to be but he actually just got - It varies on who you're playing. - [Destin] How long does - 10 minutes. - It depends on how good your hands are. - [Destin] 15? - 10, 15 minutes, yes. - Well, some people can't (Destin laughs) - Yeah some people don't count for it. - You don't play check. 'Cause you need a translator. - It's frustrating man, like always speak, did you even go to school? - [Submariner] Yeah. - Second language is English you know. (laughter) - [Destin] Where are you from? - South Carolina. - [Destin] Oh, yeah? - [Destin] He said that, you South Carolina. He's like I don't know what I'm gonna say - My accent comes in every - Do you know what code switching is? - Uh. - Code switching is when you hear someone talk in a certain way - Okay. - I do that so hard. - Oh yeah. Yeah I was talking to this and then someone came up They were like, &quot;Hey man, how's it going?&quot; I was like, &quot;What's up And she's like, &quot;Destin, are you okay?&quot; It's just a thing, man. So this is a shirt for the sun? - (speaking together) That's - That's our actual tee shirt. - [Destin] Well, you have a, - Yes. - Like this 20 square feet has like its own shirt. So this literally is a club. - [Submariner] Yes. (all laugh) - Can I know the handshake? Don't even act like there's no handshake. There's no handshake? - There is no handshake. - No handshake. - [Destin] Well let me teach you one. So, yeah, yeah. So like that, and then you roll it up, roll it up, and you throw it down and step on it. You can't smoke on a submarine, everybody knows that. (all laughing) (making fizzing sound) - I like that. - Morale is a huge thing That's why submariners get One thing that I didn't as a tool to increase I kid you not, mustaches in order to increase morale on the boat. There's a special individual on the boat, that I had it's called the yeoman. This person is in charge of all the admin. So for example, how do you get paid? Like how do you make sure like everything is accounted for and all the admin stuff This is a very important job. So it was really interesting to speak to Petty Officer Cleveland and understand what the - I'm in charge of all the and I'll handle all the crew's pay issues and all the instructions, and I just take charge, for all the personnel we have on board. - [Destin] So how do you do that? So typically when you think about pay, you have to go back to like, I dunno, headquarters. - Yes sir, so we are essentially If anybody has a problem they'll let us know and We call our, we call who we report to and we try to handle - [Destin] Okay, so that gives me a really interesting question, so, you're under water for months? - Yes sir. - [Destin] So how do people get paid? I don't understand that. - Um, so-- - [Destin] You're not like - No sir we try not to. (Destin laughing) - But, essentially when we pull back in, most of our, like 90% so when we get back into port we're going to be pretty much But when we're under water, notices, the typical correspondence stuff. Everything should be routed through us. We try to-- - [Destin] What do you Like mail? - Mail, letters, local instructions, anybody procedures, yeah typically. If something happens with they go back and they don't then they print out what and we just compare the numbers. - [Destin] Got it. So it's - Yes, sir. - [Destin] So it's going - It should be. - [Destin] It should be, and if it's not, it's a you got to handle it really fast. - Yes, sir. - [Destin] Got it. Oh, I because if there is a pay issue back home and your family has the issue, you don't know 'cause you guys are all secret squirrel stealth down here. - Yes sir. - [Destin] Yeah, has that ever happened? - Many times, yes sir. - [Destin] Really? And so and saves the day. - Yes sir, it keeps us busy. - [Destin] So you're good with numbers? - Yes sir, I try to be. (Destin laughing) - [Destin] That's good. Awesome. Nice to meet you. - You too, sir. - A couple of things about Number one, I was dog tired. So, I am not a good like barometer for what it's actually like cause I was tired. I had flown over the Arctic, took a sled out to Camp Seadragon, spent some time freezing there, and then took a helicopter out to the submarine and and asked the most intense of for hours and hours and hours. I was tired. So they could have told and it would have felt great to me. But I did not have the which is these long halls, and you gotta be super quiet, no light. (background noise) This is where people sleep. And you might be sharing a bunk based on what shift you're working. For me, they're like, we're going to put you in the he's got an extra bunk, that's where you're staying.&quot; And I was like, &quot;But, I would want to see what the other--&quot; They're like, &quot;Nope you're staying there.&quot; And I said, &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; And boy did I sleep good. (background noise) We're going to flip the lights to red. And, oh, it's so fun cause I don't (light clicking on and off) All right, I think I got it? (light switch clicking) (voices speaking in the background) So this is really good. This is the night, these These are like the really nice bunks. Oh, there's a light right there. Oh, wow. Look at that. Neat. Okay, well it's time to go to bed. Goodnight. Okay, just woke up. XO, what is it you said we were doing? - So the day just started, the oncoming wash team is already briefed. Right now we got breakfast It's kind of a special day. We got waffles with strawberry hard pack, chocolate syrup, eggs that we are going to-- - [Destin] Did you say waffles - We do have waffles and ice cream. It's not a common thing. It's only happened a couple of times but we made sure we loaded - [Destin] Okay. - So. - [Destin] All right, here we go. So what's the, what - So schedule's, we're going after that we got people set up to do some interviews with you and then once that's done there's going to be the So I'll have you back in control to see how the whole party comes together. Put the sail out through the ice, make sure we're stable on the surface. Kind of what you've watched - [Destin] Uh-huh. - And then once that's done based on the timeline for your departure, we'll see if there's for any questions you might have for us or some we may have for you. - [Destin] Sounds good. Thanks, all right. I had never even considered but it was incredible, and I just want to show you a It's wonderful, you should try it. - Okay, so this is the state room, this is where the senior officers live. So this is kind of one of the perks of going to college and coming you get a little bit So this is one room, it's Each person gets a couple So you'll see there's two, one on top and the bottom for each person. - [Female Submariner] I (laughter) - [Destin] Is this your room today? - [Female Submariner] This is my room. - Yes it is. Sorry, I got to clean. - [Male Officer] And then you can see we've got these dropdown desks where we have our laptops. So there's two workstations - [Destin] And, that's safe. - Yep, we got a safe, and then each state room has one. What we call low side and then there's two classified - [Destin] So you can email like home? - When we have the ability to communicate. - [Destin] Got it. - Yep - Which comes and goes. - [Destin] Gotcha. Okay, this one's a little interesting, when I went onboard the submarine I wanted to understand the under as we dove down under the ocean. So I took this a little pressure gauge on board to measure the pressure inside the submarine when I was there. And I noticed when I was that we are over 760 torr, So that means we are over and I found that to be fascinating. Now I didn't really but here's the data. You can see on the graph here, this is what the pressure history was while I was on the submarine and learn from that what you will. So how do you deal with medical emergencies I progressively learnt how This is my first contact (engines roaring) So this is where all the medical stuff happens on board, right? - Yup. - [Destin] So what kinds of in this little room? - In this little room, not very much. Most of my patient care happens in the ward room. - [Destin] Where people eat? - Yup. So if I have to do a I do it over there. Just like two weeks ago, I filled somebody's tube in the ward room. - [Destin] Really? - Yep. - [Destin] So, when you say surgery, what happens if somebody or something and you're at - So appendicitis we treat So starting by IV and a bunch of antibiotics really. - [Destin] Really? - We-- - [Destin] So you don't - No, we haven't cut on anybody - [Destin] But it's something you can do? - Theoretically, but it's not something that we're really trained to do. - [Destin] Got it, understood. So right now, for example, Are you the guy I see for the headache? - Yep. - [Destin] Can I get some - Yeah, definitely. - Comm inter ratio at a normal full power line. - [Destin] So, is this where - This is a portion of it. This is the ready stock. So, I have restockments here for stuff that I use all the time, and then I have lockers all over the boat, you can see them with - [Destin] Got it. - And they have either medical - [Destin] Got it. (keys clanking on locker) - Here we go. (pills pouring out) I don't know. (man groaning) - [Destin] Thank you very much. I'll take this two, okay. - Two's fine. - [Destin] Thank you very much. - Yep, you're welcome. - [Destin] I just drink water right here? - [Medical Submariner] Yep. - Okay, so at that moment, in my experience onboard the Toledo, it seemed like a pretty interesting stop. Like, Oh, okay, this is where you get your aspirin, right? Except not long after this someone was injured on board and it was what I would classify as a serious medical emergency. And if it were me and you, for example we would have gone to the emergency room. It was significant, but we were in the Arctic ocean, there was no emergency room. There was a ward room table. So what happened is, they went in there and they dealt with it. I elected to not film it. I wasn't told not to film it, but I knew that if this was me and I I wouldn't want anybody filming me. So I told the Public I was like, &quot;Hey, I'm because that just feels The Navy didn't tell me or anything like that. But to respect the privacy of the individual that was injured, I've decided to not talk about it. What I can tell you is, like they had rudimentary they dealt with a very intense situation involving like wounds and stuff right there in the middle of the Arctic, and it was impressive. This was a significant enough event that when they poked out of the ice, which you'll learn about when they sent me home, they sent this individual with me because they wanted this individual to get to medical facilities. So that's what happened. Next thing, showers. I really care about showers. It's a big deal for me. So I want to know how to take a shower or at least get clean Okay, so this is the XO for the Toledo. Sir, you just run through it. Just give me the name, everything. - Sure, awesome. So my name is Yorg Andrews. I've been in the Navy for 15 This is my third submarine, I was on board, the Henry M. I was then on the John Warner and now I'm here as an XO with Toledo. Which has been a pretty I work hand in hand with the My job is to run the boat so he can kind of focus the boat, point us in the right direction and been excited and for the last portion of the day and sharing our spaces - Yeah, thank you for sharing I appreciate that, yeah. So, this is your restroom, right? - Correct, this is the CO/XO head, so it's shared really We have a shower here on the right which is your standard shower, hot and cold water access and it has a restart pump and you can use it quickly and efficiently and minimize water usage, for us to try and minimize water usage. We're able to make plenty of you have to pump off less, and when you have to pump off less, your making sure you're staying So everything that we or waste generation is something that we're - [Destin] Good, so if how long should that shower be? - You can take as long as you want. - [Destin] But what should it be? - That's typically three to five minutes. - [Destin] Okay, three to five minutes. - Yup and then the but we'll get ourselves nice and wet shut off the water, soap up, turn on the water, rinse off, switch off the water again, and that's your standard submarine shower. - [Destin] That's what you do? - Yup. - [Destin] Okay, got it. (water in shower) - Ooh. (water in shower) Ooh, ahhh. (water in shower stops) Okay. (water in shower) Ooh, it's very hot. Okay. That was a submarine shower. And the big question, how do you go to the bathroom And this is actually a than I realized. - Now this bad boy in here, this is not a normal toilet. - [Destin] This is not a normal toilet? - So we have pressurized in order to do flushing There's a ball valve there which is a plumbing free, so you use the toilet, and you see the water go down, like so, or the waste go down like so. - [Destin] Oh yeah, it's - [XO] Yep, so it goes when you're done with the toilet. - [Destin] Yep. - [XO] Now, as Doc was saying for literally everything on board. So you'll see right here, for a flushing water closets. - [Destin] Yeah. - [XO] In case you just happen to forget that it's there, it'll be waiting for you. (Destin laughs) So with respect to these so downstream, we have other valves that we That way, when we dispose send that pressure this way. It's important that the of the procedure right, because, it'll come out in this way if you're not careful about doing it. We also have signs here to make sure. - [Destin] I've heard, - Yep, this is our blowing san sign. So we'll set it up so that when those tanks are being isolated for their discharging and that you don't and find yourself taking the pressure in a different direction. - [Destin] It's like - Yes. That's not what you want. - [Destin] So there's a lot of engineering that goes on behind all this stuff. - That is correct. - [Destin] Okay. I engineer a lot of procedures for those guys especially they understand how to execute it from the moment they start doing it. - [Destin] So why do you - The back filling is it helps perform, provide a seal so that none of the the smell can come up in the event that there's any leakage past the ball valve. - [Destin] Makes sense. I noticed there's a lot of - Yep. - [Destin] And so what's all this? - So, these are a different manuals that we have with respect to our, both our engineering and, stuff back Aft, we have a drawing booklet as well, and a couple of different In the event that there's a question that needs to be resolved or a equipment thing that most likely it's going to be in one of these books primarily. There's other books or other things that we can pick up on our LAN. Our network to do research on. But usually it's out of one of these books and so it's easier for us to just grab it, open it up and show the captain what it is that we're talking about - [Destin] Got it. And I saw, I'm not allowed to look at this? - Yes. - [Destin] Okay. So I like this everywhere - [XO] Correct. - [Destin] I mean, you have - Uh-hum. - [Destin] So is that just - So the commanding officer for being our controlling So as a result you'll have the weapons and man DC central, he'll be making announcements which is our Ship Right Announcing Circuit and I'll be communicating with him at the scene of the casualty, be it flooding, fire, whatever it happens to be. And they will track using these boards the various equipment that the different announcements and the sequence of that to go through fighting So this will get opened, he'll mark stuff up as he goes. - [Destin] What do you mean opened? Is there a door? - [XO] Yeah, this isn't actually a door. - [Destin] Oh, it's a door. - This is the door that opens So his state room's there, To make sure this space is (crosstalk) - [Destin] So, that's where the CO is. - Yes, sir. - [Destin] I didn't realize that. - [XO] Yeah, he's asleep - [Naval Officer] Oh. - I genuinely thought that like really far. - No. - He's right there. - Yeah. - [Destin] Okay. - Right next to each other. - [Destin] Gotcha, okay. I had no idea. This is amazing. Okay. Well thank you for the tour. - Absolutely. - [Destin] Yeah, thank you very much. I'm going to try to use Urinals work the exact same way. Valve, valve, okay. (doors clicking in place) (door closing) (door clicking in place) The fact that above my head when I was using the facilities are all these books that explain how nuclear submarines worked and like the inner workings of everything, it was very tempting interesting reading but I did not. (splashing) There you go. I've used the bathroom (laughs) This episode of Smarter by Raycon earbuds. I'm going to do this unboxing here to show you exactly what you get in the package when they These are called the everyday E25's. These things are fantastic.
