Now that you know what Grand If I don't? Help us instead, then your trip Yes, there's something in what you say. You will work with us then? I'm afraid that wouldn't be smart. I went through a lot to get my picture You've succeeded admirably. I think you're the most notorious man If I work alone, It sounds sensible, but be careful. Our man who traced him was found floating in the river. Quite a man, Grand. Quite. -Good luck, Mr. Rossi. -Won't you let her go with me? That's what I said, and maybe I like someone to hide behind. Do you feel like being hidden behind, Not particularly, sir. I expect you'll get used to it. It looks like you're stuck Okay, you go and find out Won't you come with me? A woman can find out more All right, I won't be long. You better keep that classic profile All right, I'm coming. -Yes, miss. -Good morning.

I guess so. Oh, Steve. You are a woman after all. I thought you were hurt. Would it make any difference? Possibly, I'm beginning to like this job. Only the job? -I spotted the driver. -A green hat and light coat. His number was RPG five, Come on. -How long to get back to Miss. Brookes? -Why? -She'll be mighty surprised. Surprised people sometimes It's okay, she's expecting me. What? Why, you're back again, Mr. Miller. Did I surprise you, Miss. Brookes? I wasn't expecting to see you so soon.

They're also interested in Mr. Grand. Rossi was on his trail in the States, working undercover as an engineer -How do you know this? He's been after Grand over here.

Well, why couldn't he have let Why enter the country illegally The trouble meant publicity and publicity -The commissioner will raise the roof. May I have Mr. Rossi, Inspector? -Very well. How about the girl? -She says she works for you too. Then perhaps Shall we wrap them for you now I'll take them now, May I ask where you're taking them? Certainly, why don't you join us?

The body is too far gone The Brookes woman was working for him, Pity, Brookes might've given us a lead. She has, she lead us to the hairdresser's. That shop may tie in -I'll get a warrant and we'll search it. Let him think his trick worked. Nothing stops Joan and I -Do you think Dr. Halas is there? You'd have to break in Risky, too. Unless the constable on the beat A cup of tea, please. Will you oblige me with a light please? -Help yourself. -Well? They finally came, -Rossi? All friendly as you please. Were they indeed? If he's been arrested, Rossi knows me. Taking him in there, Guess what? That I am not a corpse after all. I think I better leave How about me and the others? You'll drive your taxi and let the others You'll get further instructions. How about Albert? I'm just going over to the shop Once again, This time in the final stage -Good night, Max. Having trouble? This key is no good. Loan me your gun. Where was Miss. Brookes This way. I was in there, they were in here. By the time I climbed to the top They didn't come out the front. Let's take a look in this booth. That back wall might lead somewhere. Sounds like there's an opening here. There's usually a concealed button Wait, didn't you say they turned on -Yes, she switched it on. I don't want anything to happen to you. That isn't the answer. It looks like we're not getting anywhere. Just a second. Something's burning. It seems to be coming from down there. Here, put that out. He got away, but at least he won't be able to use This looks like a job for the experts. Weather and other details permitting, Albert, it's not a very original name. I refer to Dr. Halas.

One, two, three, four. Shipping here, the river, The embassies, indeed. Any one of them would be glad to gain Each with a powerful transmitter You have a point there, Reid. Give me Major Andrews, the War Office. Let's see if any of those embassies I'll be in the next room. I want to see what my assistant is doing. Asleep on the job? You'll never make a good detective. You forgot, I had to be a watchdog. It wasn't my idea. Next time, I'll do the cooking Will there be a next time? What's happening? Colonel Wilkes is on the phone, Wheels are starting to turn. Well, I might as well go back to sleep. I wouldn't do that. -Why not? They're much prettier that way. I never knew the FBI We also learn that actions Feeling refreshed, Joan? Yes, sir, I mean, no sir. In asking about strange visitors we found that the air attache of one Where to? A cheap seamen's hotel down in the city, Perhaps you'd better go and take a look.
