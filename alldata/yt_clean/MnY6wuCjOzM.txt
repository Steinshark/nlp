Because every time I see lightning, I think M.E.C. of safety and security. True genius. True comedic genius. Like we all have our mentors and you know No because he came out after what happened And what happened was there was a lightning funeral and nine people were killed instantly. There's nothing funny about that. Nine people dead, gone. Nothing funny at all. Although it must've been a bit weird because You're there because someone has died and Then it's a bit awkward now. You don't know if carry on here or do you? You don't know but it's a bit you don't know and then you're like do you put them going to be like one uncle who's like &quot;No I must buy another box? nuh uh.&quot; It's just like, you know what I mean? And if you've got like one of those possessive mothers, you know those mothers that love their kids. Probably then she's crying and then everyone's like Then they're like &quot;ahhh-&quot; and Don't you cry for them. You don't cry for them. You came here for this. You came here. You save your tears and you cry where they- Hey! HEY! They're freshly dead you can cry for them You don't, you bring those tears here and-&quot; But there's nothing funny about it. And um... And so what happened is on the Monday after MEC came out and he held a press conference and and it was very serious. And he came out there and the photographers and &quot;We... we have heard... what have happened... on that funeral. And let it be known that... we... will launch a And we will not rest... UNTIL we know... where does this lightning come from?!&quot; Not rest. His assistant was probably like &quot;Up, up.&quot; He was like, yes up, we want to know! Where does it come from?!&quot; I didn't even make the joke he just said this! I just repeated it to you! We've become a culture of distrusting, angry people. Weird angriness as well. In places where it shouldn't be. I was in Checkers the other day. I'm just shopping. It's a normal experience, you know? I get to the cashier and, those people are so angry. Like, I don't know what Checkers But they are clearly Because I get to the till, she doesn't greet me. She just pushes the little conveyer belt thing. All my groceries pull up, she's like. *Sound of a grocery scanner beeping* "Shhhh" They look at you like your dad invented the bar-code. *sound of buttons on a cash register* *Sound of a grocery scanner beeping* Then they look at you and ask you that question "Plastic?" "No, I am fine. Thank you." "No, I'll just hold it, I'll just, yea." "I'll just. No, no. Thank you, thank you." They're so angry. And they look angry. Because they've drawn they're eyebrows on. And that permanent scowl. I don't understand that trend it Why would you shave your eyebrows off? and then draw them back on where they were? It's weird, but I also commend it you know. That level of commitment has to be commended. Because I don't understand how anyone can Like how do you choose that expression? Do you just work on how you feel in the morning? You just wake up and be like, "I'm feeling angry!" "Haaaaa!" What if something good happens? Something good. You'd be like, "Yea Temby, you won the Lotto." "Yay!" "You don't look happy." "I just can't show it." "I'll draw it tomorrow." You guys, you guys love your sport out here I've never Americans love they're sport back to front you analyze them you watch the game before the game you talk about what might happen in the game and then you talk about what happened in the game and what could've and what might've but didn't happen in the game it's just the craziest thing I've seen in my life it's all about statistics non-stop. Guys come out there... there's no time for smiles or anything and ladies and gentlemen welcome to it up against OKC this is the greatest final LeBron James leading his team out here averaging 30 points double double every single game. Just in assists alone. 90 percent from the free throw line he just gone in... He's statistically gotten better his team coming in with more... Chris Bosh... coming in with more assist just like whaaa! numbers, numbers, numbers you guys know everything well I mean he's got four out of five it looks like he should be getting four and then, and then, and then it's just crazy and then you switch over to your and you're like what's happening well nobody knows... Nobody knows.... Yeah! Ha Ha Ha Ha Uh we thought the housing market was coming up Ha Ha Ha Ha but hey I mean that's the economy you never know right? you never know Well I guess stocks, they're up and down I don't really know they're up and down Those are stocks but the sports you know you need to flip that around just relax on your sports that's.... the sports I watch is relaxed... I am a huge fan of soccer Yea Oh I love soccer. you hear it in the commentators there's no statistics at all the game starts off and welcome ladies and gentlemen to this majestic match it's Spain playing against Germany Oh and what a wonderful day it is look at the crowd really excited oh and the atmosphere's amazing And the guys just like &quot;Oh yea John you can feel it. it's wonderful what do you think's going Oh nobody knows I can't even remember the last Americans will remember the last time a black man scored using his left was in 1967 when the Okay like what? this is madness I remember the worst encounter I had with the Tiny little airport, I was flying And so I am in Burbank airport and I go through security. And for some reason I was beeping, I don't know why. And I beep, go out, beep, go out, beep. Every time I have to take something of off I go out The whole time he's like, "take it off, take it off" And then the machine goes beep and he's "take that off!", and he's like getting more and more angry. I am basically naked right now I felt like an under-performing stripper, it was horrible. He's like, "take that, no, ahhh!" And finally he's just like, So I walk to the side and he's like, So I put my arms up. Then he whipped out his little looks like a midget sword, but they call it the wand. That's what they call it, the wand. So he whips that out. cause that hundred thousand Shit just got real. So he looks at me and says: "go ahead and stick So I put my arms up and he scans me *sound of a scanner* "You got any ah... you got any metal objects on you?" And I was like, "then what was that for?" "If you were gonna ask me anyway, then what was this?" "The foreplay to my honesty, what is this?" And then as if he can't do this right, he calls for backup. He goes, "I'm gonna need you to wait right here" "Can we get Velazquez to gate ah gate 10 please? Velazquez to gate 10" And he calls for a man, by the name Velazquez. Who I am assuming was the best wander that they had. Because he wasn't even on the floor They called for him and Velazquez emerged From the back offices of the T.S.A. And he walked out, and the energy changed. People bowed their heads as he walk past. Everyone gave him a little nod. You could see he was special, Velazquez was a little Mexican man. Very long mustache, big chest. And he was very short, really, really short guy. But he didn't feel short. He looked short but he didn't feel Like he had this thing. You know those It looks like they just chose to grow low. He had that energy. And so Velazquez walks down towards My guy tries to apologize, like, He silenced him with one move He stepped up and looked me in the eye. He's like, "Sir" "jibberish" And I didn't know what he was saying. But I knew what he meant. And so I stood there. I raised my arms. And as I did, he whipped out his wand. And he started using it all over me, And as soon as he did, I knew why he was who he was. It was the most magical thing I have ever come across in my life. The way he wielded that wand was unlike I felt like I was being blessed, I As he went all over me, just blessing me with his power. It was something special. It was like a force, an energy. On the outside you still heard that beeping But in my head I heard like a light Sabre, that what I heard. *sound of a light sabre* Because he was, he was to me. A little Mexican Jedi. In fact that's exactly what he was, he was my Mexican Jedi. Which by the way I feel would be a welcome No, I am a big fan, a huge fan of Star Wars. I love Star Wars. I was super excited when I found out they were I went back, watched all the movies. And I came to realize that there's no Which is weird because when you look at it, Star Wars is a vision of America. In a distant future. So Surely it would be safe to say. Judging by the current trajectory. Of Mexican people in America. I'm sure we would be safe to say by that time. In a galaxy far, far away. There would be at least one, just one Mexican Jedi. It's not even like it would spoil the story, Can you imagine how different that epic scene Them battling it out on the Death Star. The moment of realization. *Light Sabre sound* *heavy breathing* "Luke" *Light Sabre sound* "what do you want, you evil man!?" *heavy breathing* "Luke" *Light Sabre sound* "what do you want from me!" *heavy breathing* "No... look man... LOOK!" "It's your father, man" Cause all over the world they conform to a norm It's always a woman, always. And she's always calm. Always monotone. Always comes over that system, she sits in They bring her the pages one by one. You can be in Heathrow for instance you'll *PA system sound effect* &quot;Attention all passengers. Please note this is an airport announcement. No passengers are permitted to leave any items Any unattended luggage will be removed by Thank you.&quot; *PA system turns off* Everywhere in the world, even if you go to still conform to that norm. You know you go to places like China where You think and I see some of you probably thinking No, don't even laugh, that's racist. Don't even laugh. Don't, hey! Don't, no. That's racist. You don't even laugh. But they're not. They're calm. It's a woman, still the same. She's just another language she'll come on *PA system turns on* &quot;*Calm Chinese jibberish*&quot; *PA system turns off* And you know, you know they've conformed. And then you land in South Africa. And you know you've landed, you know that your back No, no, no. It's almost like who ever is closest to the No, you go do it It's the craziest thing! Luckily 99 percent of the time it's a woman but she'll come on its the craziest thing *PA system turns on* &quot;ATTENTION ALL PASSENGERS! &quot;ATTENTION ALL PASSENGERS! HELLO! HELLO! I'm talking to you! Hello! All the people that is flying Kalula.com, the plane is delayed Yes, all the people must just take a ticket for Just to confirm if your ticket says Just mustn't complain when the plane And you must just phone the people to pick you up You must tell them: my plane has changed And then they start speaking to people the __________. &quot;Okay.&quot; &quot;Okay all the people that is flying one time the gate has changed.&quot; &quot;It's not D2 it's C15.&quot; &quot;It's not D2 it's C15.&quot; If you can go to D2, you can find nothing. &quot;Okay, bye bye.&quot; _______________. I don't surf. I sit on the beach and I enjoy it from there. It looks beautiful, I enjoy it. And I'm sitting on the beach in Malibu and There's just one girl surfing out there. California babe and she's rocking it, you She's got this long blonde hair and tan looking She's riding her board and doing her thing people do, you know? Just stay here, there's no need for... And surely, sure enough at the end of it that like *Wave crashing sound effect* and I was like, &quot;You're dead. Dead.&quot; But she wasn't. She comes out of the water and she's having the time of her life! *surfer girl accent* &quot;Heeeeeey there! Are you like gonna come in? The water is like super ahhh-mazing!&quot; I said, &quot;Uh, No. no, Thank you. No, thank you. I'm just going to sit here and watch you. You're very good. Keep it up, keep it up!&quot; She's like, &quot;O-M-G! You talk funnyyyy!&quot; &quot;No I don't talk funny, you talk funny.&quot; &quot;Where are you frommm?&quot; &quot;I'm from South Africa.&quot; She's like, &quot;Oh, wowww! Like Africaaa? How did you get here?&quot; What? I used my monkey grip under the plane! How did you get here? She doesn't even wait for my answer. She runs, she's in the water she's doing her thing She comes back out and now all of a sudden She runs out onto the beach and she's like, I'm like, &quot;Hey, Americaaaa...&quot; &quot;So like you don't surf at all?&quot; I said, &quot;no, I don't. I don't. Where Johannesburg, there's no surfers out here, She's like, &quot;Aww, that's too baaad. &quot;Like, do you guys have waves in Africaaaah?&quot; Do we have waves? A grown human being asks me if we have waves Like no, no, we don't, we don't. Yeah, by the time the water gets to our side of It's so worn out from all the traveling. It tries but it's just &quot;Aaaaughhh!&quot; Do we have waves? She's brilliant she says this and she runs back into the water. And every time she goes out there, it's she It's like... it's almost like she's fishing for stupidity It's almost like there is a shark just like, Because she comes back and I'll never forget this until She comes back onto the beach and she stands next to &quot;So like, Africaaa, can I like, ask you a questionnn?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.&quot; &quot;If you're like, from Africaaa... have you like... ever had AIDS?&quot; You know what's funny? Is I wasn't offended by the fact that she but I was offended by the fact that she said, &quot;ever HAD AIDS&quot;. Like AIDS is something you could've &quot;had&quot; like &quot;Hey Jonah, I didn't see you at work last &quot;Yeah Bro, I had a bit of AIDS there, I just it hit me hard, eh? You know, I took some Corenza, now I'm back Bro.&quot; Ever &quot;had&quot;! And you know, I know, I know as a child of a continent it's my duty to educate people when I meet It really is a part of who I am, but... but you know when you look at someone in their there's no hope? It's just that old SABC tone just like *SABC ringing sound effect*. It's only two of us... and I'm bored. I figured why not have some fun? So I look at her and I'm like, &quot;Yes. Yes, America. I've had AIDS many, many times.&quot; She's like, &quot;Oh wow, reallyyyy? Oh mah gaaaahd! So, aren't you gonna be like, I said, &quot;No, no, no! AIDS is not as bad as you think. You just shouldn't have too much at one time! And then you stop for a bit and then after Wooo hoo, more AIDS! you know? You just chill.&quot; She's like, &quot;Wowwww, AIDS are like chocolate?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah, yeah! You should try it sometime.&quot; She's like, &quot;Noooo. That's disgusting! 'Cuz then if it's like, chocolate... then in like, AIDS chocolate and I'll be all stickyyy and I'll be all dirtyyy!&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, then you just take a shower. *Audience laughing* No, what are you guys? what do you...? Oh no! Don't you laugh at my president! DAMN YOU PEOPLE! DAMN YOU! I don't accept your laughter! DAMN YOU! Don't you laugh! This has nothing to do with that great man! Turning my jokes against me! NO! I will not participate in this madness! How else do you get clean?! Good evening or not. Sorry I get nervous when I start a comedy set I find comedy is very similar to sex for me Um Well it is exactly like sex when you think about it, you know... just me the comedian playing the role of the man and you the audience the role of the woman because it my job to satisfy you and you just have to sit there and then just like sex my success how much noise you make during my performance. You are just faking it now, thank you. It's a one sided afair. So I hope you aren't the quite types *sound of giggeling'* No, no, you where great really. *Loud laughter* makes it worse when a guy laughs in the middle of it. It is not meant to be funny. This is my first time in Australia after two days of traveling to get here I finally arrived and it is quite a quaint place it wasn't supposed to take me that long, we where delayed. First delay was I got to the airport in Johannesburg I was on a Quantis flight and they said, I said how long, I said well that is not a delay, that is cancellation. I said it is another day, so I came back the next day and we tried it again and this time we where on the plane and there was another delay of about 4 to 5 hours where we are stuck on the tarmac and the plane couldn't take off because the airplane was not balanced. I have never heard of that in my life. that is what the pilot said and like because he is a pilot we Because the pilot sounds serious when &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen I got a bit of a problem on the plane&quot; &quot; I don't kno0w what it going on, &quot;but we will have to check on what is going on&quot; &quot;we will get back to you as soon as we know.&quot; Hell of a flight. As soon as he said that I looked at the fat people but not in a bad way, not in a bad way Just in a objective manner, like You need to sit one, yeah the plane probably you, it's probably you. Speaking of fat people, is Biggest That what I see on T.v I ,ove that show, it is fantastic it is always on T.v What a fantastic show. For those who where they try to help fat people lose weight through torture basically. Yes, both emotional and physical Yeah, the do horrible things like leaving then ask them why they are eating it &quot;Why did you eat the food Kevin, because it is there and he is This is like his specialty, you know this before he came why are you now acting shocked? they should do a show about the people that make that is what they should say. The show is not helping anybody. I love it, what an amazing show. But yes we are flying, so we flew from Johannesburg to Sydney Sydney you come in and then you have to leave the you go through border control, very friendly I must say Australia I am very impressed, you you guys are very chilled out, very cool Like visa is not really need, it is but not like &quot;Do you have your visa?&quot; No. &quot;Oh, alright&quot; You know. I learned the secret to getting through from a few Chinese men that where ahead of me is that you just have to irritate the There was a guy ahead of &quot;Excuse me Sir, where are you staying He went, &quot;Kangaroo, kangaroo!&quot; &quot;No Sir, where are you staying?&quot; &quot;Kangaroo, kangaroo!&quot; &quot;No Sir, you cant, where are you &quot;Kangaroo, kangaroo!&quot; She is like, &quot;Okay, just and he just came in and he was like It was fantastic, it was fantastic. Yes and he had this look when It works every time, you know. He had this knowing look about him So we, you come in and it seems too easy, because it is because the border control is very chilled but then you get to the customs which is the most hardcore place in the world. I don't know what happened in Australia but People are standing there being strip-searched &quot;Where did you get the apple!&quot; &quot;I don't care if you cant speak English, you &quot;Where did you get the apple?!&quot; &quot;I don't care, I don't care! You see people, there was a He's like: &quot;Is that meruana? &quot;but you with the apple, back What did fruit do to your country? It is such a weird place getting used to and then you cant understand anybody, because you guys say you speak English but it's not it is like you try but then I could not tell because sometimes it actually sounds like Chinese I used to hear people making jokes about but then when you come you don't know if because it sounds the same to me especially like a very deep *Chinesse jibberish* Oh yeah, Shushini, shushini No, I don't know what is going on here man. and then the phrases that I do understand don't make sense like positive phrases. Like apparently apparently she'll be right. I don't know who she is but this is very important to say in Australia. You also feel it is very important to Yes, I did not ask you about your life philosophy I just asked you how you where on the day &quot;No worries, no worries.&quot; Really not even one, not even one worry? Really in Australia, are things that good here? not even one worry, not even prostate cancer? not even one, not even North Korea? because those guys are close, I am just saying. Not even one worry? and the strangest one, and this is something I have learned that you should teach people before they come is The correct answer to the phrase, &quot;How you going&quot; Is not, &quot;By airplane.&quot; I feel it is strange asking people this while they are traveling I was flying, we where in Sydney going to Melbourne and I got to the counter I said to the woman: &quot;hi I am going to Melbourne please&quot; and she said: &quot;Oh yeah, how you going?&quot; and I said: &quot;by airplane.&quot; that is why I have chosen this building over here to be traveling in. and she said no, I was greeting you. and I said: &quot;oh, no worries.&quot; You guys have been great, thanks for having me. This is so amazing, so many of you here, That was like the most amazing was going to be this weekend. show long before them...

It was weird in a good way! He started giving a sermon... And he started talking about Martin Luther King. And then he started talking about slavery. And I could see, in that moment... There were people in the audience who were like... Somebody STOP this man! God Save The That is why Jacob has been different because because a lot of people panic in when it comes to our politicians because of this. Especially around election time, that is when It has always been the case for our first democratic election in 1994 Remember that? Nelson Mandela was about to become president most of the country was over joyed, a few people where worried. you heard them whispering &quot;I am leaving, I am leaving!&quot; &quot;I am going to Australia Mary.&quot; &quot;I am going, it has been fun &quot;because you know now they are going &quot;I am leaving, I am going to Australia.&quot; Then Nelson Mandela became president and they all stayed. &quot;He is a wonderful man! &quot;If it was not for him I would have left.&quot; &quot;Wonderful man, he is amazing yeah&quot; &quot;He is really great, I love him. You thought they where over it but Thabo Mbeki about to become president and people lost it. &quot;I am leaving, I am going to &quot;This time I am going. You know that now that &quot;It is only a matter of time&quot; &quot;I am leaving, I am going to Australia!&quot; But once again, Thabo became president and they all stayed. He left. No shame, no no shame. Then we had Kgalema Motlanthe, wasn't that crazy? Kgalema Motlantheeeee He is like our interim president, He was that guy, hey? No one knew what to get of him, it was just like crazy and they lost their minds even worse. &quot;I cant believe it! &quot;I didn't even vote!&quot; &quot;What the hell! &quot;and Thabo Mbeki is our president&quot; &quot;and the next thing you know, &quot;Kgalema Mmmmglanti! &quot;I am going to Australia, I am going!&quot; But then once again thankfully they stayed, and then it got interesting because it was the turn of Jacob Zuma. OOOOHHH The original boogeyman. People panicked again, although it was different for the first time in South African &quot;Eish!&quot; &quot;How much is that ticket to Australia again?&quot; Jacob knew he had to go he knew there was only one way from Jacob was like, &quot;They will remember me&quot; &quot;One way or another&quot; &quot;Mandela might be the father of the nation I wanted Jacob to be a mad man, I I wanted him to not give damn, walk into parliament 4 hours late, his top undone, belly hanging out walk in like nothing is wrong in the world Everyone has been waiting for him, him running and singing *Jacob humming and dancing* Helen Ziller in the corner &quot;Jacob, you are late Jacob&quot; &quot;Jacob we have been waiting for you for 4 hours, you cant come...&quot; &quot;Hey, shut up you!&quot; &quot;Shut up.

Jacob on the mountain with the wind blowing through where he would have hair. Just him, J.Z and mini me. Altough it wasn't that mini, you have to admit that was a pretty solid picture. Well I am just saying if it was me, I would have been there at the gallery everyday, just like posing and waiting for people. Maybe like, &quot;Hallo, nice, hallo&quot; &quot;Take a picture, take a picture there, take a picture&quot; &quot;they must know&quot; *Laughter* So strong and so confident. He's like: &quot;This picture is racist, It wasn't even that disrespectful, I know you might not like it and that is your personal opinion, but it wasn't that... even the name of the picture was Jacob Zuma, thew spear. The symbol of the Zulu nation for hundreds of years made famous by king Shaka him self conquering army after army with the spear. ______________________. The spear of the nation, It is not like that guy called it The Spear, big and manly. That is why our president didn't complain, because he understands art, he is cultured. The guys around him complaining on his behalf I hate it when people do that, he was not even offended they ran to him like little kids tattle taliing. &quot;Jacob!&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;What happened now?&quot; &quot;Jacob, it is disgusting! &quot;Did you see what they did? They painted you, they painted you!&quot; &quot;There is no paint on me&quot; &quot;I am fine&quot; &quot;No sorry, they painted a picture of you&quot; &quot;They painted a picture of you, just show him the picture! and they came running with the but Jacob Zuma is a chilled out guy, He probably didn't even see &quot;I don't see&quot; &quot;anything wrong&quot; &quot;with this&quot; *Jacob Zuma laughing* Giggling Casanova has no time for these trivial pursuits I would not be shocked if Jacob is having the time finding himself a new romantic game to play with the ladies You know he is romantic, he knows what it is about, you know? He is there, covered him self in body paint Playing Barry White in the background *Barry White music playing* Just in the bedroom looking in the door at his wife &quot;Number two&quot; &quot;are you ready?&quot; &quot;for the spear?&quot; She is there like, &quot;WHOOO!&quot; &quot;I am not ready!&quot; and he is like, &quot;here I come&quot; Jacob Zuma was on the balcony waving at everybody because the elections are coming up, so Waving. Yeah, you are going to You will see him at the rally's dancing He is going to be out shaking hands, kissing babies mostly his babies, but still *kissing* &quot;Vote for me&quot; Because you know he has to connect with the people the ANC is having a tough time right now this is one of the worst times in ANC history Highest levels of corruption, The ANC is just a shadow of it's former self Yeah, people in the ANC are disgusted by the ANC They stand there like, &quot;No man, no man, &quot;no man, enough man They say this while looking in the mirror &quot;Come on ANC&quot; &quot;you can do better, come on man&quot; It's gotten bad It is so bad Kgalema Motlanthe does not go Vice president but you never see them together. because Kgalema is like &quot;I don't want that guy around&quot; always tells Jacob, &quot;let's go Kgalema&quot; He is like, ___________________. It has gotten bad, who do you vote for? Mampele, Rampele It is a funny name, wont Yes. Doctor Mamphele. Used to date Steve Becko, so She is an intelligent elderly black woman and she came out, she denounced the ANC she said, &quot;as black people we must stand up &quot;vote for a hung world and vote for change&quot; We are like, and then she made a big mistake she challenged Jacob Zuma directly. Yeah, head to head but she used money as her platform big mistake. Never bring money up around Jacob, ever. Look, because I don't know if you have noticed. there is always money around him but it is never his. Always, oh it is the Sheiks money, it is the Gupta's money, it's never his money, he is always there like, &quot;No, it's not mine &quot;It's not mine, &quot;I don't know, it's not mine Yeah. Building a house for two hundred and fifty million rand. Jacob, where the hell is that money coming from? &quot;I have a bond&quot; &quot;for eight hundred thousand with FNB.&quot; I go, eight hundred thousand? two hundred and fifty million &quot;That is not my problem&quot; &quot;my calculator says it is fine&quot; Ramaphele tried to challenge him, &quot;Jacob Zuma has not declared &quot;He does not tell parliament how much money he has&quot; &quot;we want to know how much he has and &quot;I will lead by example&quot; &quot;I as Ramaphele have fifty five million rand&quot; &quot;Jacob, how much do you have?&quot; People where like, &quot;how much do you... &quot;How much again?&quot; &quot;Fifty five million?&quot; &quot;Where did you get that money?&quot; She is like, &quot;even me I work very hard, but fifty five million?&quot; &quot;how much overtime is that? _____________________. She is like, &quot;but we want to know where &quot;Hey, don't worry about that guy lady, don't worry&quot; &quot;we know he stole it&quot; but you, where did you get fifty five million?&quot; I don't know who to vote for anymore. You cant make jokes about Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, if you do this you get arrested and sent so I know I would go there and I would not be able to resist. like I would just be like, &quot;Ha, ha mustache&quot; and I am in jail. which normally would not be such a bad thing because what would happen with an normally your president would just come there and he would ask for you to be released that's all, but now I don't know if that guy *Laughter* will come and fetch me. *Laughter* I can see him sending Mugabe the e-mail now &quot;It's fine Rob&quot; &quot;keep him.&quot; *Laughter* Jacob Zuma has not smiled in months. He was our laughing president, He was that guy *Zuma laughing* I have not seen him laugh for months his been there in parliament, in the corner *Zuma crying* and the funny thing is he introduced us to Julius Malema that is the craziest thing about this whole situation, huh? It is a thin line... between love and hate. He introduced us to Julius Malema that was his guy he came with him and we where we saw Julius in thew Jacob Zuma brought us a puppy, a little ANC puppy He was like, and we where like, wow Hey Jacob, your puppy and he was like, &quot;Ha, ha, ha&quot; &quot;good dog&quot; We are like, hey Jacob your puppy is chewing our shoes and he was like, &quot;ha, ha Now the puppy is grown up biting the owner Zuma's leg is there like, &quot;Hey, hey! &quot;Pay back the money!&quot; &quot;Hey man voetsek! &quot;Voetsek! Guys help me!&quot; and we are there like, &quot;ha, ha, ha, ha, ah&quot; &quot;Good dog&quot; Have you guys seen our president, Oh man, he is back. He is back and better than ever before, you know? the last few months has Ben so taxing on him People fighting with him, people in He has been stressed sitting and then he found out that he would be paying nothing absolutely nothing for the upgrades at Mgangla, and he walked into parliament a new man had a bounce in his step his swag back Jacob 2.0 I mean he is still doing the same but now he has a certain level of panache I saw him mess up a speech the other day, this time he didn't frown, he did not get stressed he just worked through it &quot;and here we can clearly see&quot; &quot;the arm&quot; &quot;prem, pre , pro, fap rem, Edie&quot; &quot;pre, medi, mam,med,medi&quot; &quot;red, ray, rem, ma, mabo&quot; *Zuma laughing* &quot;a pre, med, mabo, redie, mabo&quot; *Zuma laughing* *Zuma lauging* &quot;a pre-me meditated&quot; Just came back and he handled it. I love how he just stepped away and did the cutest little... I don't even know what he was doing it is almost like he is just moving his Like he knows when it is in the wrong place, it doesn't... He just shook it up. and he came back in even the way he handled the scandal was powerful We thought for sure that Nkgandla would be his downfall and yet Jacob Zuma took something so and threw it back in our faces. &quot;Well, we are clearly living&quot; &quot;in&quot; &quot;a place where there is poverty of politics&quot; &quot;people asking questions&quot; &quot;but they don't want answers&quot; &quot;Questions, more answers&quot; &quot;Investigating&quot; &quot;they ask again questions&quot; &quot;more answers&quot; Then in parliament we hear&quot; &quot;point of order, &quot;Yes, _________. &quot;ha, ha&quot; ________________________. Who is this guy? Huh? He is just shrugging it off, evading maneuvering Never mind the Ngandla joke, I love that blew my mind, I have never seen Jacob Zuma do that He looked over and was just like *rolling his eyes* When did Jacob Zuma start rolling his eyes? That is not something he does, Jacob In fact, presidents don't roll their eyes it is not a very presidential thing to do in parliament, to roll your eyes at the position. Even the most deviant rulers in the world don't roll their eyes. When the UN is telling the leader of North Korea to stop making nuclear weapons you don't see Kim Jong-un going, &quot;Ag, whatever!&quot; You don't roll your eyes. Jacob Zuma did and he did it in style, I want to know where he learned it how he learned it, has he been doing it for a while? because rolling your eyes is part of an attitude you don't just roll your eyes, if you you are bitchy, you know? is he doing more than that? Now I see Jacob Zuma in a totally different light, now I am picturing him hanging outwith the rest of &quot;Mr. President I want to know where is the money Mr. President &quot;where did the money go?&quot; and he is like, &quot;over and over they keep asking me&quot; &quot;I mean literally, I am tired now&quot; &quot;like, cant they get over it&quot; &quot;like that Musi guy, get a life already&quot; &quot;just because you hang with white chicks, I mean&quot; &quot;Please&quot; &quot;Whatever&quot; Is that what he is doing? and if he is, where did he learn that? Where do you learn to roll your eyes at It is not your friends, it is not your colleagues. It is probably your kids, yea Jacob Zuma probably learned it from one of his daughters maybe she was going out for a night with her friends caught her as she was leaving. &quot;Hey, where are you going?&quot; &quot;where are you going dressed like that?&quot; &quot;Dad, I told you I am going out with my friends. &quot;First off all, you are already in a party&quot; &quot;Secondly, no daughter of mine will dress like that&quot; &quot;go and change!&quot; &quot;Dad, what are doing? &quot;come on, why are you doing this. I can &quot;Hey, you will do as I say&quot; &quot;as long as you are living under my roofs&quot; &quot;which I have paid for with other people's money&quot; &quot;you will obey me, go and change!&quot; &quot;Dad, come on. Why are you doing this &quot;everyone else dress like this, all the other kids do it&quot; &quot;are all the other kids my children?&quot; &quot;You never know.&quot; &quot;Huh, what are you doing.' &quot;Don't come in this house with that DA attitude&quot; &quot;go and change, now!&quot; &quot;Ag, whatever!&quot; &quot;What was that?&quot; &quot;what did you just do?&quot; &quot;I didn't do anything daddy&quot; &quot;Don't lie to me, I saw it.&quot; &quot;you did something with your eyes&quot; &quot;it looked like The Undertaker&quot; &quot;but they came back, what was that?&quot; &quot;I just...&quot; &quot;I just rolled my eyes dad.&quot; &quot;That made me feel so insignificant.&quot; &quot;What you did there made me feel like you did not &quot;Can you teach me how to do that?&quot; &quot;Yeah, like...&quot; &quot;It's easy, you just roll your eyes like&quot; &quot;if someone says something you &quot;Ah, whatever&quot; &quot;Ah, whatever&quot; &quot;Wow, wow dad. That is too much&quot; &quot;you have just got to loosen up and be like &quot;Ag, whatever&quot; &quot;I think I got it.&quot; &quot;No you don't have it dad, you are rolling your head&quot; &quot;you are supposed to roll your eyes.&quot; &quot;and my eyes are where?&quot; &quot;exactly&quot; and he was off ready to roll baby. and he did, he rolled straight into parliament. Shut it down. Turned Ngandla into a joke, you You say Ngandla in parliament Yeah, immediately. It's done. it's done. Just, you know. I love it so much, you know what I a lot of people do not realize this. Jacob Zuma was making a joke out of Ngandla, yes. but what was more interesting to me was the fact that he was mocking Vusi Mangmani, the leader of the DA. A lot of people did not pick this up. When he is doing the whole &quot;Ngandla&quot; He is mocking Vusi Mangmani's model C English accent. That is what he is doing. Jacob Zuma thinks that he speaks funny. *Laughter* That is priceless. Jacob Zuma is sitting in parliament like, &quot;I would like to know about the allocation of funds&quot; &quot;more especially regarding&quot; &quot;the homestead at Mgandla and whether..&quot; *Zuma laughing* &quot;This guy talk so funny&quot; *Zuma laughing* &quot;Ngandla&quot; &quot;Ngandla, would you like some tea with your crumpets?&quot; &quot;mash, mash, mash, mash&quot; &quot;mash, mash, mash, mash-mellow&quot; Jacob Zuma is just laughing at him, that's just beautiful. I don't know how much of it is true or not what I do know is If Jacob Zuma was allowing the Gupta's to then it was not my president being corrupt to me it was the Gupta's telling him what to do It is like Julius said &quot;The Gupta's where in his ear all along&quot; &quot;They where inside his ear all along&quot; and you know the way Julius sounded, it sounded amazing because Like I get the phrase when they go they where in his ear but he said they where inside his ear. It sounded like the Gupta's where actually inside Jacob Zuma's ear. when actually would have made sense if you think about it. what if they where inside his ear the entire time? how do we know that every single time he was actually telling us like he had one of those on those hidden camera shows like he was there in parliament there was a van with a *tapping on microphone* Hello Jacob? Jacob? Jacob you are going to repeat Jacob? Can you hear me Jacob? Roger Roger Roger No this is Atul here Jacob I know who it is guys I know who it is okay lets just make sure one two, one two, one two? okay what you want to do no one two like three one two like three Oh okay I've got you guys so I must just repeat yes you are going to okay this is going to be very complicated I trying to listen to you while also speaking we understand Jacob but you know we so repeat everything that I say okay okay I will repeat everything and that is probably why things went wrong. because I don't know if you've ever tried to your mind jams Jacob Zuma could never deliver a speech its not that he couldn't read he couldn't listen and speak at the same time I used to watch him and think YouTube is buffering this is why data must fall but it turns out he was just there he was in parliament the press saver said his name as it came _____________________. Jacob Zuma came out to the podium his earpiece was ready good evening everybody good evening everybody Proud South Africans and Indians especially and Indians especially we are doing well in this country we are doing well in this country and also don't listen to don't listen to the news papers even though what they say Is right Sometimes also there is no problem with the ANC. the membership is growing currently we have nine hundred and thirty nine hundred and thirty nine thousand sixty No thirty nine million six hundred three hundred and ninety Nine hundred million sixty two thousand sixty two thousand No Jacob Point hundred Million. No Jacob listen properly listen properly listen properly listen properly No Jacob listen properly nine hundred million give me a pen there give me a pen No Jacob hundred million thirty-nine thirty-nine million sixty-three sixty-three thousand *coughing* No man Jacob That was ___________. *Zuma laughing* *Zuma Laughing* Okay this is going wrong Abort Jacob I bought *Laughing* *Aplause* They where in his ear the entire time. I miss South Africa man. I miss it, I watch parliament now again. I went straight into it, watching the vote of no confidence I was so stressed. I don't know about you, but I was so stressed. I was like please, please, please don't let Zuma go, please. Don't let Zuma go, my jokes. Please1! I did go to Zambia though. Fantastic place Zambia. Went there, visited the While I was there I had a chaperone His name was Alinani, sweet guy. And his job was to get me And every day he would give me a new piece of Like one day he looks at me and goes, "Trevor, you know Zambia is a I said, "Oh, okay Ali. He says, "Yea, so please stay away from profanity." And I said I can do that, I assumed he meant swearing. But I didn't say anything because I wasn't No, no, because in Zambia people have names like Profanity. So, that's how I laughed when I met Screwdriver. Yea, because you see In South Africa we have African names you can translate. Like Happiness, Blessing and Hope. Those kinds of names. But then in Zambia People give their names, like they give their children names of everyday English words, anything. So like, table, chair, car, house. You see, like you just have to get used to it. It's very hard, but you have Which was difficult because I met a mechanic, And that was not, especially when Brake And his dad was there like, "stop it Brake, And I was like, "Hey, stop it Brake. Ha Ha." But you have to get used to it, it's a cultural thing. And so, you have to respect it. And the second warning Ali gave me, was even stranger. We are driving thru Lusaka, the capital. And Ali looks over at me in the car and goes, "Trevor, you know here in Zambia I said, "Oh, okay Ali. That's He says, "Yes, so while you are here don't be gay." I said, "What?" He says, "I know it can be tempting "Don't be gay." "Don't be gay?" I have never been warned of this in my life, don't be gay? "Hey bru, don't be gay. Don't be gay." "Don't be gay?" Crazy, crazy warning to get. But then I found out why Ali was warning me. Turns out in Zambia being gay is illegal. If you are found to be gay you will be arrested and sent to prison for more than thirty years, yea. Which is a bit of a weird punishment. When you think about it. I mean I am not saying that gay guys would enjoy prison, I am just saying if I was gay That's not the worst thing They would be like, "you I would be like, "Oh no." Don't be gay? I couldn't believe this, gay is a crime in Zambia. Which got me thinking. If gay is a crime, They actually have to police gay. Yeah. Which means in their police force, they have a gay division. It's a crime, it's a crime. So that means they have a murder unit, a And then they got a gay unit. Yea, they have got a little G unit in their police force. That's responsible for all things gay. That must be the most fun police You get to go under cover, dress up really nice. Get in touch with your flamboyant I bet the sergeant's there every "Good morning Detectives." "Welcome everybody, today we will "We have just been informed of a fashion "And as you know, the gays cannot "Therefore we will be in full attendance "Let us make sure we are here." "Detective Chepoa?" "Present!" "Detective Table?" "Present!" "Detective Mongai?" "Present!" "I think he's in too deep." How do you police gay? Do they stop you if you look suspiciously gay in the streets? I mean, gay doesn't have a look. But maybe you Do the police pull up there and is like, *police siren* "What is the purpose of that flamboyant scarf?" "Put your hands up!" "Turn around! Don't tempt "You are going to jail." How do you police gay? Do they have roadblocks? Do they have gay roadblocks? They are just like stopping people in they're cars. "Good evening Officer" "Good evening Sir" "License Please?" "Thank you very much, Mr. Stylish. Hey?" "Tell me Sir, have you been gay this evening?" "No, I have not been gay. In fact, I don't gay at all." "I see, not even one or two?" "No, No. No gays for me. No gays for me." "Okay" "Then tell me Sir." "What is that I can smell on your breath?" "Is that balls?" "No, no, no, I" "I don't even eat Chutney, No" "A ha" "So you are not gay?" "No, not gay at all" "Then Sir, can you please blow into this?" Ahh Don't be gay. I was not gay while I was in Zambia, so I had a good time. Went around and saw the people. The highlight of my trip I asked Ali for suggestions. Ali said to me, "Maybe you should travel "just have a good time." I said to Ali I want to do something special. He said, "Oh well, in that case" "Maybe you can go to the Mall and if you are lucky" "maybe you can ride the escalators." I said, "What?" "Hey, I am not promising anything" "but if you are early, maybe you can go once or twice." I said, "Escalators?" "I know, mind-blowing ha?" I thought he was messing with me. Until I found out people in Zambia go to the mall just to ride the escalators. It seems ridiculous until you understand the back-story. When we were in Zambia there were Five, in the whole country. The first escalator was built in August. Not August 19?? No, no. You remember August. Past August? They built they're first escalators, ever. Yea, and so now it is all the rage. People But now, I don't want you to That's not what Zambia is, They are developing just as we are, they have roads. They got airports, the have beautiful hotels. Stunning shopping Malls. They've got everything we The have just never had escalators. And now they started building them. And because of that people go there, and Yea, Dads will go home and fetch their children. "Children, we are going to the Mall." "To do what Daddy?" "To do shopping, and to ride the escalators!" "Yay!" We couldn't believe this so We get to the Mall. The Mall is empty. Escalators are packed! People are standing in lines going There's old people, young people, even couples. There were couples. Guys that "I am going to take you to the escalator girl." "Oh, you are so fancy hey?" Escalators. Some people didn't even Kids were easy, they just jumped on. Old people would panic. There was one guy who got on the escalator, and it was going up. And I guess to compensate for He started leaning. He fell down! He fell down! Oh, it was fantastic to watch. We spent like three hours doing this, And you know what? Our patience paid off, because A school brought a class of children to the Mall. And their excursion was just to ride the escalators. It was magic. Thirty kids, about five years old. Cutest things, And they are standing there together holding hands. And they were so excited, they were shining. Not from excitement, that Vaseline. And there is two teachers with the children, And as they do the start singing at the "Escalator" "Escalator" "Escalator" "Oh, Oh, Ohhhhhhoh Escalator" "Escalator" It was the sweetest thing ever. People are waving at them, smiling. And these kids see the escalators. And they lost, their minds. These kids went crazy. They're not holding hands, they It looked like a zombie movie, or something. They are jumping, but then you see the smiles on their faces. It's like the end of Saraphina. You are These kids are screaming. They are The teacher can't control them. "Hey! Get back! Get Back!" "Two-by-two! Two-by-two!" Two-by two was one of the She's like, "Two-by-Two! Next to Other kids are still jumping, she can't control them. There was one fat kid. He couldn't "Escalator!" "Escalator!" It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life. It's like I had gone in a time machine to a time when escalators were new. Brand new and popular So popular... that people were taking pictures of the escalators using their iPhones! Tempiwa, technology eh? Ah ah ah! Who even thinks of these things eh? Can you imagine? Eh we are in the future now my man! Mechanical moving stairs ah? What are we going to see next? I don't even know, I don't even know! I wonder how it works, ah!? Let me just check... Siri, how does an escalator work? I don't know Hey guys, thanks for watching make sure to subscribe to my and by prizes, I mean surprizes!
